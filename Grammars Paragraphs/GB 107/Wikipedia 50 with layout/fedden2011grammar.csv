3.13.3.     The negative clitic =baTo express negation in clauses which contain a finite verb the clitic =ba is
employed. It follows the subject suffix (198). In verbs with a tense suffix in
the post-subject slot =ba follows the tense suffix (199). =Ba mostly co-occurs
with the negative clitic =mo (3.13.4):(198) n          mén=o=mo                       ol-êb

                                                 3.13. Clitics and particles   159Medial verbs cannot be marked for negative polarity with =ba. =Ba always
has scope over the whole sentence, which can consist of any number of
chained clauses. On negation in clause chains, see 12.2.
   To express negation in non-verbal predications =ba is also used. In this
case it follows the predicate term. This is discussed in more detail in 9.11.4.
An example is:(200) yeye      y               asyang=ba=bo
      no        DEM.DIST         sharp_stick=NEG=QUOT
      ‘ “No, that’s not a sharp stick.” ’ [Pig story]Usually the negative clitic =ba co-occurs with negative =mo elsewhere in the
sentence. Within a single sentence or clause, =mo may only be expressed
once, namely on the constituent immediately preceding the verb which is
marked for negative polarity with =ba. =Ba is independent of stem aspect and
TAM morphology. The use of =ba can have an influence on which subject
marker alternant is selected (see section 8.5.2 on subject marking).","[184, 185]"
"
12.2.        PolarityLike illocutionary force, positive polarity, which is unmarked, and negative
polarity marked by =ba on a final verb in a clause chain are interpreted as
having scope over the whole clause chain:(9)     a.             ayam     bi-Ø-e=a

               PL.AN.O-see.PFV-DEONT-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG       because
               ‘because he wasn’t well and couldn’t walk around this place
               and see them, …’ [Crows]
476     12. Operator scope in clause chaining constructionsIf the medial clause in clause (a) occurred in a clause chain whose final verb
was not marked with =ba to indicate negative polarity, its meaning would be
‘he was well’. Due to the scope of negation over whole clause chains,
however, this interpretation is impossible for (9).
    As the polarity specification must not change within a clause chain, two
independent sentences have to be used in order to say something like ‘He
didn’t see Asuneb, he saw Beitab’, for example:(10)             Asuneb=e=mo
        3SG.M     PN=SG.M=NEG        a-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be
        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL                   Beitab       -ta
        3SG.M       PN           3SG.M-EMPH        a-têm’-Ø-e=be
        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hasn’t seen Asuneb. He saw Beitab.’Medial verbs can never be marked for negative polarity with =ba. A clause
chain in which a medial verb is marked as negative is ungrammatical:(11)    *        Asuneb=e=mo
        3SG.M     PN=SG.M=NEG        a-têm’-n-e=ba=ta
        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=MED        Beitab   -ta              a-têm’-Ø-e=be
        PN       3SG.M-EMPH        3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        Intended: ‘He didn’t see Asuneb, he saw Beitab.’
12.3.     TenseTense is marked by either pre-subject slot suffixes (-b(H) ‘Non-hodiernal past’
and -s ‘Remote past’) or post-subject slot suffixes (-bio ‘General past’ and -so
‘Hesternal past’). All of these are absolute tense markers, i.e. they locate an
event with respect to the moment of speaking. In final verbs, the tense suffixes
                                                                12.3. Tense    477in the post-subject slot, -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal past’, only co-
occur with -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ in the pre-subject slot.","[501, 502, 503]"
"
3.13.4.    The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):(201) mo         dob-ski
          NEG    3SG.M_CL.O-turn          dob-ski-n-em-eb=e!
          3SG.M_CL.O-turn-AUX.PFV-DEONT-2SG.SBJ=HORT
          ‘Do not keep turning him (a male child) around!’ [Crows]If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:

      ‘I don’t know.’
3.13.5.       The interrogative clitic =mThe interrogative clitic =m is employed in polar questions (see 10.1.1). Like
negative =mo, interrogative =m typically encliticize to the final constituent
before the verb (or the coverb in case of a function-verb construction) but can
occur as a free word clause-initially. An example is (204):(204) m          wentê-b-eb=ta                           o-b-i

          or
          ‘Do you understand what I’m saying?’
          (Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]
3.13.6.       The topic clitic =leThe topic clitic =le attaches to preceding noun phrases and adverbial and
medial clauses to indicate their topicality. The reader is referred to later
sections for examples and more detailed information on topicalized noun
phrases (6.9), topicalized medial clauses (11.3), and topicalized adverbial
clauses (13.2.5). An example of a topicalized noun phrase is (205):(205) memé               =le              ||   Sobining=e
      children           PL.AN=TOP              PN=SG.M          dl-êt-n-e=a
          PL.AN.O-take-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
          ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]The use of =le in topic-only questions is discussed in 10.3.

noun phrases to express the notion that something which is expressed in the
same sentence or which is obvious from the context also applies to the referent
of the noun phrase. This is illustrated for a first and second person singular
pronoun in (206) and (207), respectively, and for a noun phrase in subject,
(206) and (207), and object position (208) and (209):(206) n=sa       klayâm             bl-Ø-i=be

          ‘they put the leaf (bag) too down between (them) as well’ [Danenok]Prima facie it might look that =sa ‘too’ is another suffix which derives
complex pronouns from simple ones, like -ta derives emphatic pronouns
(3.7.4). However, consider the following example which shows that if sa was
a pronoun suffix, we would not expect it to follow the topic clitic, which
marks noun phrases as topicalized not just noun:(210) y le        li=le=sa                      besa     y

          ‘Well, while these too were just living there (i.e. without trouble or
          altercations with their neighbours), they…’ [Mianmin and
          Telefomin]
3.13.8.     Interjections and formulaic utterancesInterjections are particles which express assent or dissent, emotional states,
and hesitation in speech. Due to the fact that interjections are usually uttered
with a marked intonation, and the difficulty of teasing apart lexical tone and
intonation, I will not mark tone on interjections. The inventory comprises:(211) ae, ai                               ‘yes’
      ayasi                                ‘expressing surprise or disbelief’
      ayo                                  ‘sorry (feeling regret or pity)’
      ba (< baa ‘say’)                     ‘ehm (hesitation in speech)’
      dowe                                 ‘boah man’
      ekskyus (from Tok Pisin)             ‘excuse me’
      klâye                                ‘well now’
      o                                    ‘oh’
      yait, yaiks (from Tok Pisin)         ‘yuck’
      yle, yle                           ‘well (also hesitation)’
      yeye                                 ‘no’The interjection ayo can only express regret and is not used for apologies.
   I think it is plausible that ba ‘ehm’ indicating hesitation goes back to the
verb stem baa ‘say (PFV)’. As bare verb stems are commonly used as
imperatives, it is conceivable that speakers used the imperative form baa
[mbà] ‘Say (it)!’ to “order themselves” to continue speaking. Synchronically,
however, the interjection ba is not pronounced with a pharyngealized /a/.
   In the eastern dialect, there are no interjections for the purpose of greeting
people. Instead whole formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following
patterns of question and answer are customary:Arriving party says:                         Customary answer:
bo y bliba? — ‘Are you (PL) there?’        ae, n y biobobe — ‘Yes, we are there.’
klayâm bieba? — ‘Are you well?’              ae, klayâm blibe — ‘Yes, I am well.’Departing party says:                        Customary answer:

this place.’                               place?’In the western dialect area, the form klayâmo ‘really good’ is commonly used
to say hello or bid farewell to somebody. Speakers of the eastern dialect do
not have this convention.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"

8.6.7.5. Auxiliary-serialized verb forms plus -Vm ‘Deontic’Deontic mood is a form of speaker-oriented modality used to express that the
situation denoted by the verb should or – if negated – must not take place.
    All deontic forms of vowel-final perfective stems are serializations of a
perfective lexical verb stem and the perfective auxiliary n, which is inflected
for deontic mood with the suffix -Vm. The capital ‘V’ indicates regressive
vowel harmony. The suffix vowel always has the same quality as the first
vowel in the following subject marker (see 2.7.2 on vowel harmony in this
suffix):
310    8. Verb morphology(192)             am=o

       build.PFV-AUX.PFV-DEONT-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They are should/must build a house.’Verbs inflected with -Vm are often found in in the protasis of conditionals (see
13.2 on adverbials). In that case the interpretation is ‘Conditional’ rather than
‘Deontic’, e.g.:(193) n        fút=e     halà’-n-im-i=o
      1SG       tobacco abstain.PFV-AUX.PFV-COND-1SG.SBJ=N2
      ‘If I abstain from tobacco…’Negation of deontic forms (i.e. with the clitic =ba and the negation particle
mo) expresses that an action is impossible or forbidden:(194) tn=i=sna             unáng=i=sna            =mo
      child=PL.AN=too       woman=PL.AN=too        PL.AN=NEG       went-aa-ib=ba=be

       ‘Children and women must not hear (the name of the Sofelok
       tobacco).’ [Sofelok, 2]
8.6.7.6. ProhibitiveFor the prohibitive, deontic verb forms followed by a hortative illocutionary
particle are used. Although the verb cannot be marked for negative polarity
with =ba ‘negation’ in the prohibitive, negation is obligatorily expressed
through the negation particle mo:(195) fút=e=mo              fu-n-em-eb=e!
      tobacco=SG.N1=NEG     smoke-AUX.PFV-DEONT-2SG.SBJ=HORT
      ‘You must not smoke!’Prohibitives always take the hortative illocutionary marker =e (=ne after
vowels):

      3SG.F=NEG     come.PFV-DEONT-3SG.F.SBJ=HORT
      ‘She must not come!’
8.6.8.    HortativeThe hortative is a form of speaker-oriented modality used to express the
speaker’s wish that an action (which can involve the speaker himself) take
place immediately or as soon as possible. Hortatives can be formed in the
perfective or the imperfective.
   Mian hortatives are interesting because their formation involves a special
set of subject suffixes which cannot be found in any other paradigm.
Hortatives are additionally marked by an illocutionary particle =o ~ =e:
8.6.8.1. Perfective hortativesThese are inflected for realis mood with -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ (table 8.16). Before
/i/, realis mood is mostly realized as -Ø.","[335, 336, 337]"
"
10.1.1.     Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
    The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
    In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):(1)       klayâm             bi-Ø-eb=a?
          properly_good      stay.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Are you (staying) well?’ [Observed]Constituent order does not change in questions. The declarative marker =be,
the emphatic/quotative marker =bo, or the exclamative marker =ble are simply
replaced by =a and the utterance receives a marked intonational contour as
opposed to the corresponding declarative sentence. Compare the polar
question in (2) and its declarative counterpart in (3):(2)       kb             mn=e         sm     gwáab

       ‘Your boy is still small.’The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
   Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.(4)    ns      lo=m

       ‘Do you like this song?’As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:(5)    kbo       glol-amît=o=m             betelâ’-n-eb=a

       ‘Did you open and again close the window?’ [TMA Questionnaire,
       61]The interrogative marker =a can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to query whether the addressee wants the speaker or the group of which
both speaker and addressee are members to perform a certain action:(6)    ayal=e            kemela-n-an=a?

       ‘Shall we go?’ [Observed]In polar questions involving non-verbal predications the interrogative particle
attaches to either a noun (8), an emphatic pronoun (9), a distal demonstrative
(10), an adjective (11), or an adverb (12). The interrogative clitic m may not
be used. The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with
the range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative
non-verbal clauses. Detailed information on non-verbal clauses can be found

questions that introduce the (implied) negation of the proposition as a second
alternative, which is equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered in (14)
are that the referent either is a wound or is not a wound. This is a type of polar
question because the appropriate responses are ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[412, 413, 414, 415]"

8.6.5.    Inflection of the existential verbThe existential verb n/bi~bl occurs on its own as a main verb with the
meaning ‘be (there), stay, exist, remain’. The perfective stem n is always a
bound form, whereas there are a bound stem bl and a free stem bi in the
imperfective. The latter form, bi, can be inflected but can also appear in its
bare form in serial verb constructions. The imperfective stem is realized as bl
when followed by /i/.
   The existential verb plays an important role in the paradigms of verbs that
need to be serialized with one of the stems of the existential verb to express
certain TAM categories (see 8.6.7).
   The existential verb has a number of irregular stems apart from the basic
perfective-imperfective distinction n/bi~bl, which will be discussed below.
300     8. Verb morphologyTable 8.14 sets out stem contrasts and inflectional possibilities for the
existential verb.
   There are several noteworthy features about TAM inflection in the
existential verb.
   First, -n ‘Realis’ contrasts with -Ø ‘Imperfective’, while in all other
directly inflected verbs -n and -Ø are allomorphs with the meaning ‘Realis’.
Thus, there are both (156) and (157):Table 8.14. Stem contrasts and inflection of the existential verb n/bi~bl
 Stem                                          TAM

                                               -b ‘Imperfective’

      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has grabbed it.’This allomorphy is not found in the existential verb. Elision of -n in forms of
the existential verb creates a semantic contrast. Compare (158) and (159):(158) bi-n-e=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has been staying (up to now).’(159) bi-Ø-e=be
      stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He is staying.’The second noteworthy feature about the existential verb is that it has three
additional stems apart from the perfective stem n- and the imperfective stems
                                        8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs    301bi~bl-: biaaH ‘stay (Non-hodiernal past)’, example (160), bina               ‘stay

      ‘I was staying (but not today).’(161) bina-b-o=be
      stay.HAB-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
      ‘She stays habitually.’Third, irrealis mood in the imperfective is formed with -aamab, if the subject
is not animate plural. If it is, -omab is used:(162) bi-aamab-i=be
      stay.IPFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I will be staying.’(163) bi-omab-io=be
      stay.IPFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘You (PL)/they will be staying.’The existential verb shows two contracted forms. When either of the forms
bi-Ø-e [stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ] ‘he stays’ or bi-Ø-o [stay.IPFV-IPFV-
3SG.F.SBJ] ‘she stays’ are followed by =a ‘Question’ the disallowed vowel
clusters *[mbia] and *[mbioa] are simplified to [mbia] and [mbua], respectively.
    Apart from these differences, TAM inflection of the existential verb
proceeds in much the same way as in other directly inflected verbs. The
perfective stem n is used in irrealis forms in the perfective (164) and (165) and
in deontic forms (166):(164) n-amab-i=be
      stay.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I will stay.’(165) n-omab-io=be
      stay.PFV-IRR.PL.AN.SBJ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘You/they will stay.’(166) n-im-i=be
      stay.PFV-DEONT-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I should stay.’
302      8. Verb morphologyForms which are only marked -n ‘Realis’ are by default interpreted as
referring to events having taken place immediately before the moment of
speaking and appear interspersed in texts about the far and remote past.(167) bi-n-o=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
      ‘She has been staying (up to now)/was staying.’For realis forms, further temporal specification is possible by suffixing -so
‘Hesternal past’ or -bio ‘General past’:(168) bi-n-i-so=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-HPST=DECL
      ‘I was staying yesterday.’(169) bi-n-i-bio=be
      stay.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
      ‘I was staying.’
8.6.6.     Negation (with the existential verb)Negation is commonly expressed with the negative particle mo and the clitic
=ba, which is always the last formative in the verb before the illocutionary
particle (see 3.13.3). Mian has an alternative way of expressing negative
polarity in the perfective only, involving an invariable form of the existential
verb:(170) Tesinab=e       tl-im             bl-im=o=be
      PN=SG.M         come.PFV-NEG      exist-NEG=PRD=DECL
      ‘Tesinab hasn’t come.’ [Observed]In this example the perfective verb stem tl is inflected with -im signalling
negative polarity, followed by the existential verb bl inflected with the same
suffix, effectively yielding a double negation construction.
   The exact semantic difference between this type of negation and the
negation with =ba and their respective usages are not fully clear at the
moment. However, a few observations can be made which might inform
further research. The negation with the existential verb is restricted to
perfective aspect and can only be used to express negative polarity of events
which could have happened (but did not happen) in the past. For instance, it is
                                         8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs    303not allowed with future time reference. In order to say that someone will not
or does not want to come, only the ba-negation is possible:(171) Tesinab=e=mo      tl-aamab-e=ba=be
      PN=SG.M=NEG       come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL
      ‘Tesinab won’t/doesn’t want to come.’Likewise negation with the existential verb is disallowed in the imperfective.
Again, the ba-negation needs to be used:(172) Tesinab=e=mo          wen-b-e=ba=be
      PN=SG.M=NEG           eat.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL
      ‘Tesinab isn’t eating.’
8.6.7.    Auxiliary-serialized verbsFor some TAM combinations, e.g. realis or remote past marking in the
imperfective, verbs have to be serialized with a range of auxiliary stems,
which all belong to the existential verb. Also, verbs of some conjugation
classes (see 8.4) require an auxiliary to be inflected for certain TAM
categories, e.g. irrealis in V-stems, as opposed to N-stems which are directly
inflected. The stems of the existential verb are used as auxiliaries in the sense
that they are necessary in the verb form to bear the inflection. All stems used
as auxiliaries also appear in independent forms of the existential verb.
    The justification of this analysis as a serialization has to be postponed after
the criteria for verb serializations have been discussed (see 11.1.4).
    Table 8.15 below summarizes all possibilities for the serialization of
perfective and imperfective stems with an auxiliary stem.
    While directly inflected verbs have -n and -Ø as allomorphs with the
meaning ‘Realis’, in the inflection of the existential verb -n ‘Realis’ contrasts
with -Ø ‘Imperfective’ (see 8.6.5 above). We observe the same contrast in
auxiliary-serialized verb forms. Compare (173) and (174):(173) a-fû’-bi-n-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL

8.6.7.1. Auxiliary-serialization with imperfective stemsImperfective stems need an auxiliary in order to be inflected for -n ~ -Ø
‘Realis’, -s ‘Remote past’, or -b(H) ‘Non-hodiernal past’, and for the (present)
habitual and the past habitual.
    Imperfective V-stems (i.e. verbs stems ending in an vowel) cannot be
inflected directly for realis mood. Instead, they have to be serialized with the
imperfective stem bi of the existential verb. Realis forms have immediate past
as their default temporal interpretation, but they occur interspersed in texts
about the far and remote past:(175) wen-bi-n-e=be
      eat.IPFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has been eating (until now).’ OR ‘He was eating (at any time in
      the past)’Forms with the auxiliary bi inflected with -n ‘Realis’ can be further suffixed
with -so ‘Hesternal past’ and -bio ‘General past’ to locate events at different
levels of temporal remoteness:(176) wen-bi-n-e-so=be
      eat.IPFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-HPST=DECL
      ‘He was eating yesterday.’(177) wen-bi-n-e-bio=be

commonly used by speakers of the western dialect.
132      3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.7.5.     The possessive pronouns with nominal functionPronominal roots from either bound series can be suffixed with -mi to form
the possessive pronoun with nominal function, e.g. n-mi ‘mine’ (from the
simple series), and the ‘alone’-possessive pronoun with nominal function, e.g.
kleb-mi ‘yours alone’ (from the ‘alone’-series). Table 3.13 lists all forms.
Grey areas indicate the absence of a gender contrast.
   The possessive pronoun with nominal function can appear in the predicate
of a non-verbal clause to assert ownership, as in (117):(117) le                     nmi=be

possessor position. The acceptable alternative to ungrammatical (118) is
(119):(118) *nmi        am=o=be

      ‘This house is mine.’Possessive pronouns with nominal function can occur in noun phrases in
subject position, as in (120), and in object position, as in (121), in a clause. As
argument noun phrases, they occur either with an article (120) or with an
adnominal emphatic pronoun (121):(120) nilibmî=e                        sm=e         le

3.7.6.    The negative pronoun suffix -kobThe negative suffix -kob attaches to roots of the simple bound series. It always
co-occurs with the negative enclitic =ba, which is used in negated verbal
predications. Pronoun forms negated with -kob only occur in the predicate of
non-verbal clauses:(122) kb-kob=ba=be

134      3. Word classes and grammatical relationsA pronoun negated by the suffix -kob plus the enclitic negation =ba and
functioning as the predicate in a non-verbal clause can be preceded by an
overt noun phrase as the topic, as in (124):(124) wéng=o       -kob=ba=be
      talk=N2      N2-NEG=NEG=DECL
      ‘Talk, no!’ (lit. ‘Talk, it’s not it.’)
3.7.7.     The free ‘alone’-seriesAll roots of the ‘alone’ bound series can be suffixed with -kiem ~ -yem to form
a free ‘alone’-pronoun, e.g. kelebkiêm ‘only you alone, you on your own’.
This free ‘alone’-pronoun series is only attested in subject position:(125) kelebkiêm           tl-Ø-eb                         kesoto

numeral ‘one’ (see 6.3.5).","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"
"
9.11.4.     Negation in non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are negated like clauses with a finite verb with the
negation clitic =ba. This attaches directly to the predicate term. Unlike verbal
predications, the negation clitic =mo, which attaches to the constituent
immediately before the predicate, cannot be used in negated non-verbal
clauses.
   The following examples show negation of non-verbal predications
expressing identity (135), a property (136), and possession (137).

9.12.     Reciprocal constructionsMian has two constructions for describing reciprocal events: (a) a bare
reciprocal, in which verbs with a plural subject are most likely to be
interpreted reciprocally and (b) a dedicated reciprocal construction which can
only be used for reciprocal events.
376       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause9.12.1.     The bare reciprocal constructionLike many languages, Mian has a bare reciprocal construction, in which verbs
with a plural subject are most likely to be interpreted reciprocally. Such verbs
have also been called ‘naturally’ reciprocal verbs in the literature (Kemmer
1993). An example is given in (139):(139)           wéng=o            o-b-io=be
      3PL.AN     language=N2       say.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘They are talking (lit. saying language).’ [MPI reciprocals, 1]
9.12.2.     The sese-constructionThe dedicated reciprocal construction involves the reciprocal suffix -sese. The
only function of this construction is to encode reciprocal situations. It is very
rare in the spontaneous corpus. Reciprocal semantics are entailed:(140)           i-nâ’-sese-bl-Ø-io=be
      3PL.AN     PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘They are hitting each other (i.e. are engaged in reciprocal hitting).’Reciprocants have to be animate. Encoding of reciprocal events involving
inanimate participants is unattested in Mian.
     The participants in a reciprocal event occupy the same set of argument
positions they would in a normal clause, i.e. they have to be (i) subjects and
(ii) objects. The object can be indexed either by a prefix or a suffix depending
on the argument structure of the verb.
     In example (141) the reciprocants are subject and object (marked by a
prefix):(141)           ya-têm’-sese-bl-Ø-io=be
      3PL.AN     PL.AN.O-see.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘They are exchanging glances with each other.’In the following examples, reciprocants are encoded as subject and object
(marked with a suffix) with different semantic roles, namely goal (142),
possessor/benefactive (143), and possessor/malefactive (144):

       ‘They burn (lit. set fires to) each other’s houses.’The existential auxiliary can be regularly inflected to locate the reciprocal
event at different points in the past:(145) 

       PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL

       completed).’(146) 

       PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-HPST=DECL
       ‘Yesterday they were hitting each other.’The dedicated reciprocal construction has several noteworthy features.
378       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseFirst, the existential auxiliary bi~bl ‘be there, stay, exist’ agrees with the
whole set of reciprocants.
    Second, the reciprocal suffix -sese occurs immediately after the verb stem
and before the auxiliary. This is peculiar because in Mian verbs which appear
with an auxiliary the auxiliary immediately follows the stem of the lexical
verb without the possibility of any intervening suffixal TAM morphology.
This suggests that the sese-construction is the result of a syntactically more
complex construction in which constituent parts have been fused together.
    Third, the whole set of reciprocants is cross-referenced on the verb with an
object prefix or suffix, which are in the plural in examples (140) to (146).
    It must however be pointed out that all of the above examples are strongly
dispreferred for situations with just two participants. In a reciprocal situation
with only two participants the non-subject reciprocant is cross-referenced by a
suffix in the singular:(147) unáng           asú    uláab=i              te

          touch.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-RECP-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
          ‘Two women meet and while they are talking they are touching each
          other.’ [MPI reciprocals, 3]In the case of just two participants, the non-subject cross-referencing suffix
has to be singular. In this situation, Mian merges the agents through plural
subject marking whereas it keeps the patients apart through singular object
marking.","[400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"
"Yet, despite the considerable degree of similarity between medial and final
verbs, there are principled differences between the two. Medial verbs can
neither be marked for irrealis or deontic mood nor for negative polarity. Nor
can they be inflected for hortative mood. Furthermore, medial and final verbs
do not co-occur with the same set of clitics. While the latter co-occur with
clitics indicative of illocutionary force, such as =be ‘Declarative’ and =e
‘(Content) question’, the former usually only co-occur with the medial verb
marker =a. This marker is presumably derived from the co-ordinator =a ‘and’
which is used to coordinate noun phrases, e.g. tn=a unáng=a=i
[child=and woman=and=PL.AN] ‘(the) children and women’, and which in
turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’.
    As noted above, morphological markers indicating co- or disjoint subject
reference are a common feature of medial verbs in clause chaining
constructions. Medial verbs carry a marker (which may be zero), whose main
function is to indicate whether the subject of the verb in the following clause
has the same subject or a different one, but which also incorporates other
meanings, mainly temporal and aspectual ones, such as sequentiality (SEQ)
and simultaneity (SIM) of events described by the two consecutive clauses
(Stirling 1993, Roberts 1997). The following sections deal with S/R
morphology of medial verbs in Mian.",[450]
"
1.3.        Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
   There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
   Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
   The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
   Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
   About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect
8   1. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
    Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
    Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
    In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
    In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominative-
accusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
    Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
    Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
    Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
    Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
    Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
    Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational

11.5.        Medial verbs in utterance-final positionIt is quite a common phenomenon for Mian medial verbs to appear utterance-
finally in natural discourse. However, such utterances are usually not taken to
be grammatically complete sentences (Reesink 1987: 87). Their verbs are
clearly medial and not final because they are not interpreted with respect to
the moment of speaking (as final verbs are) but rather with respect to some
subsequent event which is not mentioned but implied or understood, since it is
obvious to the addressee from the context established by the situation in which
the utterance was made (Reesink 1983: 225).
    Although clause chains do not involve subordination (in the sense of
embedding) but rather co-subordination, the phenomenon under discussion
here is comparable to the widespread use of subordinate constructions as main
clauses in the world’s languages with particular semantic or discourse effects
(Evans 2007).
    Note that medial verbs in utterance-final position always take the medial
verb marker =ta rather than =a. An example is provided in (124):(124) n       sít=o            fubâ-n-i=ta
      1SG      tooth=PL.N1 wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘I’ll brush my teeth first and then I’ll …’ [Observed]Medial clauses as independent utterances are invariably understood as
desiderative statements about the future. Examples like (124) are abbreviated
468    11. Chaining constructionsversions of a full clause chain ending in a final verb inflected for irrealis. A
possible example is (125):(125) n        sít=o               fubâ-n-i=ta
      1SG       tooth=PL.N1         wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED       áam          un-aamab-i=be
       lie.SG.SBJ go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I’ll brush my teeth and then go to bed.’A clause with a medial verb in final position, such as n sít=o fubâ-n-i=ta in
(124) above cannot be construed to mean: *‘I have brushed my teeth’, for
which an independent sentence has to be employed, as in (126):(126) n      sít=o            fubâ-Ø-i-o=be
      1SG     tooth=PL.N1      wash-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
      ‘I’ve brushed my teeth.’In (126), the final verb fubâiobe ‘I’ve washed (it)’ is zero-marked for realis
mood. As there is no alternative temporal reference point indicated, the default
interpretation is that the action took place immediately before the moment of
speaking.
    Another reason why utterance-final verbs in examples such as (124) above
should be treated as medial and not as final verbs is that the markers in the
pre-subject slot are interpreted as S/R markers. The S/R system limits the set
of available subjects for the implied event. For instance, the medial verb in
(124) fubânita is inflected with -n ‘SS.SEQ’. As the subject is first person
singular, the subject of the implied event must be coreferential. In all other
person-number combinations, -n only indicates sequentiality of events (127):(127) funa-n-eb=ta
      think.PFV-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘You think first and then (anybody)…’In the next example the medial verb is marked for DS. Consequently, the
subject of the implied event must be disjoint (regardless of person and number
specification of the subject):(128) aai=e            dowôn’-s-eb=ta
      water=SG.N1      eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘You’ll drink water first and then someone else will…’
                                   11.6. Non-verbal clauses in clause chains   469It is possible for utterance-final medial verbs to also take one of the
illocutionary particles =be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble
‘Exclamative’, =a ‘Question’, or =e ‘(Content) Question’ (which normally
only occur on final verbs) in addition to the medial verb clitic =ta. Again,
such structures are not grammatically complete utterances but imply an event
which must be readily retrievable from the linguistic or extra-linguistic
context. Examples (129) and (130) illustrate this for a declarative and an
interrogative sentence, respectively:(129) fanin-wal=i              wengsâng
      ancestor-PL=PL.AN        story        baa-n-ang-ge-n-i=ta=be
        say.PFV-REAL-IMMACC.SG.SBJ-say.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED=DECL
        ‘I am about to tell an ancestor story.’ (Implied: ‘and I will tell it
        now’)(130) sít=o           fubâ-n-eb=t=ya?
      tooth=PL.N1     wash-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED=Q
      ‘Will you brush your teeth first?’ (Implied, e.g. ‘and then go to bed’)
11.6.     Non-verbal clauses in clause chainsMost often the predicate of a non-verbal clause is followed by an illocutionary
particle which marks the end of independent and grammatically complete
utterance. However, non-verbal clauses also occur in clause chaining
constructions without an illocutionary clitic. Two examples are provided in
(131) and (132):(131) Kasening Milimab        n-ta            wengsâng       lo

Operator scope in clause chaining constructions
12.0.      IntroductionGrammatically marked categories such as tense, mood, polarity, illocutionary
force and the like, called operators by Foley and Van Valin (1984) and Foley
and Olsen (1985), differ in the scope they have in clause chaining structures.
The final verb is usually marked for such categories whereas the medial verbs
in the same clause chain depend on some of this information. While medial
verbs encode sequentiality or simultaneity of events and switches in subject
reference, they rely on final verbs for information on temporal location, mood,
and illocutionary force of the events denoted by the medial verbs. This is
typical for co-subordinated structures, such as clause chains (Reesink 1983,
Foley and Van Valin 1984).
    In this chapter, all operators that occur in final verbs in clause chaining
constructions and the scope they have over the clause chain will be examined
in some detail. The operators are ordered according to categories:        Illocutionary force   =be                ‘Declarative’
                              =ble               ‘Exclamative’
                              =bo                ‘Quotative, emphatic’
                              =a                 ‘Question’
                              =e                 ‘(Content) Question’
                              =o ~ =e            ‘Hortative’
        Polarity              =ba                ‘Negation’
        Tense1                -bio               ‘General past’
                              -so                ‘Hesternal past’
                              -b(H)              ‘Non-hodiernal past’
                              -s                 ‘Remote past’
        Mood                  -n                 ‘Realis’

                              -(V)m              ‘Deontic’
        Aspect                -b, -l             ‘Imperfective’
                              -m                 ‘Inchoative imperfective’
        Habituality           bina               ‘Habitual’
472     12. Operator scope in clause chaining constructionsOf these, illocutionary force, polarity, and tense always have full scope, mood
and habituality can have full scope but do not have to, and aspect finally is a
local phenomenon that never has scope.","[493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498]"

10.3.       Topic-only questionsTopic-only questions are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is given,
as in English What about John? or And you? The speaker has a particular
question in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied
question is, normally something that would have been asked immediately
before about a different discourse participant or something that was
anticipated by a statement, such as I’m going. What about you? (Implied: Are
you going as well?). In Mian topic-only questions are formed by using a free
pronoun or noun phrase and the low-toned topic clitic =le. In the examples
below, possible implied questions are given in brackets. If context is lacking
the default interpretation of a topic-only question would be about the topic’s
whereabouts:(58)      bo=le?
          2SG.F=TOP
          ‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
          ‘What do you want to eat?’)
                                               10.3. Topic-only questions   403(59)   Leoni    =le?
       PN       3SG.F=TOP
       ‘What about Leoni?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Leoni doing?’,
       ‘Where is Leoni?’)Topic-only questions are a special case because they do not display any of the
usual strategies to mark an utterance as a question in Mian. As can be seen
from the two examples above, there are no interrogative words nor do any
interrogative particles occur.
    I assume that there are two reasons why (58) and (59) are readily
interpreted as topic-only questions though they do not bear any of the markers
typical of questions in Mian: (a) they have their own distinctive intonational
contour, namely a level high pitch on the topic marker =le which is almost as
high as the H on the preceding vowel and (b) as a matter of convention, any
utterance of the structure NP=TOP is interpreted as a topic-only question.
Chapter 11
Chaining constructions
11.0.    IntroductionThis chapter deals with two different types of chaining construction, both of
which are highly frequent in Mian discourse. The first type is verb
serialization where two or more verb stems are concatenated to form a
sequence of predicates within a single clause. Within serial verb constructions,
I distinguish between core and nuclear (or ‘tight’) serializations. The second
type of chaining construction is clause chaining where two or more clauses are
chained together to form a sentence.
   These two construction types have in common that they are essentially
coordinate (i.e. not subordinate or embedded) structures and that their last
constituent carries grammatical information, such as illocutionary force and
polarity, which has scope over the entire construction. This form of
dependency relation in serial verb constructions and clause chains is also
called co-subordination in the literature (Reesink 1983, Foley and Van Valin
1984). A succinct definition of co-subordination can be found in Reesink
(1983: 224-226): “[Co-subordination] refers to a process whereby two items
are coordinated into a new whole with operators applying to this new whole
rather than to one of the conjuncts.” The scope rules of operators in clause
chains will be taken up in detail in chapter 12.","[428, 429, 430, 431]"
"
10.2.     Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
   Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
   Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):(18)    fàb      un-Ø-eb=e?
        where    go.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Where do you go?’(19)    wan-ta                   kàb      le
        who-3SG.M.EMPH            cup      DEM.PROX.SG.N1        klutâ-n-e=ne?
        smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Who’s broken this cup?’ [TMA questionnaire, 127]Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.
                                                     10.2. Content questions   391    The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
    Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
    The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:(20)      fàb      o-fâ-n-an=e?
          where    3SG.RESID.O-put.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT =CQ
          ‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
   As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
   There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"
12.4.      MoodThe three mood suffixes, whose scope rules are under discussion here, are
-n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’, -(a)mab/-omab ‘Irrealis’, and -(V)m ‘Deontic’. While verbs
in clause chaining constructions must agree in tense they may vary with
respect to mood.
12.4.1.    -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’The mood marker -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ has scope over the whole clause chain,
indicating that a whole sentence has real status, as for example in (16) and

no cases where the mood value of a medial clause is at variance with the realis

the whole clause chain.
12.4.2.     -(a)mab/-omab ‘Irrealis’On the default interpretation (especially with subject coreference throughout
the clause chain) irrealis marking with -(a)mab/-omab on a final verb has
scope over the whole clause chain.(18)      n       aai=e             obdî-n-i=a

          ‘I will fetch some water, pour (it) down into the container and boil
          (it).’However, in natural discourse one finds clause chains which look identical to
(18) in terms of their structure but in which irrealis marking does not have (or
does not need to have) scope over the whole chain. Such variable scope
behaviour of irrealis marking is what we would expect given that irrealis is a
mood and not a tense category. Consider (19) and (20):(19)      tob-ò-n-i=a

          ‘I want to light (it, i.e. a cigarette). Now I’ve lit (it) and will smoke
          (it).’ [Rolling smokes]The last two examples are from a procedural text in which the speaker is
rolling a cigarette. The full text is in the text collection in appendix 1. The
speaker translated tob-ò-n-i=a in (19) into Tok Pisin as ‘Mi kisim tabako lip
pinis’ (that is ‘I’ve taken the tobacco leaf’) and as=e ob-tanà-n-i=a in (20) as
‘Mi laitim pinis’ (that is ‘I’ve lit (it)’).
    These examples suggest that irrealis marking can be interpreted as having
scope over the whole clause chain but that it can also be interpreted locally,
i.e. confined in scope to the clause containing the final verb which is marked
for irrealis. In elicited clause chains without switch of subject reference,
consultants interpreted irrealis marking exclusively with scope over the whole
chain. If subject reference was disjoint, however, both readings were readily
offered:(21)                  un-Ø-e=a                                       éil=e

          ‘He will go and they will kill a pig.’ OR ‘He has gone and they will
          kill a pig.’
12.4.3.        -(V)m ‘Deontic’The suffix -(V)m ‘Deontic’ can but does not have to have scope over the
whole clause chain. In (22), both readings are possible:(22)      a.             ayam       bi-Ø-e=a

               OR ‘(Given his affliction, i.e. a severed child’s foot stuck in

               them, …’ [Crows]On the full scope of the negative clitic =ba, see 12.2.
    To sum up the discussion on mood category scope, irrealis marking with
-(a)mab/-omab and deontic marking with -(V)m differ from ‘full-scope’-
operators like tense and all operators indicating illocutionary force or polarity
in that they can also be interpreted locally. Realis marking with -n ~ -Ø always
have scope over the whole chain because medial verbs cannot be inflected for
irrealis or deontic mood.","[505, 506, 507, 508]"

Acknowledgements
The present volume is the heavily revised version of my doctoral dissertation
“A grammar of Mian, a Papuan language of New Guinea”. It is wider in scope
and also tries to get rid of the rough edges of the dissertation. Since my days
as a Ph.D. student I have been back to the field for two more months
expanding the corpus and tying up loose ends in the analysis. This larger
corpus, the critical and helpful comments of the external reviewers, as well as
two years of turning over various issues of Mian grammar in my mind, helped
me to develop a clearer view of many of these issues. I would like to sincerely
thank the following people and institutions for providing help and support
during my Ph.D. and while revising the material and preparing it for
publication. All mistakes are, of course, my own.
    A great debt of gratitude is owed to the people of the Mianmin
communities in Mianmin and Yapsiei for sharing their language, culture and
lives with me during my stay in Papua New Guinea. In particular, thanks to
the whole Milimab family, especially to Kasening Milimab, for great patience
and interest in this project and for taking me in as one of the family.
    Special thanks go to my language consultants: Kasening Milimab, who had
an immense knowledge and was very concerned that I learn Mian properly,
Asuneng Amit, who had the gift of telling wonderful stories and the patience
for paradigm elicitation, Liden Milimab, whose superb command of English
was helpful in many ways, and Raymond Davai, who taught me basic Mian
tonology by indicating pitch movements with hand gestures, after it had turned
out that the method of having speakers whistle the tones failed. Thanks also to
Beitab Fenobi and Ibalim Soubgena, from whom I was able to record
historical accounts and descriptions of traditional Mianmin initiation rituals
and to Umsin Milimab, Wentak Yung, Awaseb Oblib, Ms. Selem Kasening,
Milsen (aka Mandat) Milimab, Eron Yung, Davai Milimab, Wils Tloniab,
Stanley Ebtem, Headmaster Nontlin Dab, Ray Waniab from MAF in Tabubil,
Jeremiah (aka Vagi) Yung, Ebel Yangsin, Aiben, and the pastors Uneyab and
Maikas.
    I am grateful to my supervisors Nick Evans and Rachel Nordlinger for
steady guidance and support throughout the Ph.D. project.
    Thanks to Nick for always challenging me intellectually in our supervision
meetings, for never being satisfied with the second best, but also for steady
encouragement along the way. He not only made me be critical towards my
work and sharpen my analyses of Mian linguistic structure but also made me
aware how important it is to have the reader in mind when writing a grammar.
vi   AcknowledgementsThanks also for many valuable tips concerning fieldwork and equipment
(especially the ‘dead-dog’ bag to keep things dry).
    Thanks to Rachel, who was always there for spontaneous meetings, in
which we discussed various topics of my thesis and brought some sense into
the complex Mian verb morphology. Also for being a great moral support
throughout the time of my Ph.D.
    I thank the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen for
enabling me to continue my work on this grammar while being a postdoc in
the Language and Cognition Group, and the Arts and Humanities Research
Council (UK) for giving me the opportunity to continue my work and finish
this grammar while working on the ESF EuroBabel project “Alor-Pantar
languages: origin and theoretical impact” (AH/H500251/1).
    The fieldwork I have conducted during my time as a Ph.D. student (in 2004
and 2005) was funded by the Arts Faculty of the University of Melbourne and
the ARC Discovery Project “Reciprocals across languages”. The last field trip
(in 2008) was funded by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in
Nijmegen. I thank these bodies for their financial support.
    I wrote the revised version of my thesis presented in this volume as a
postdoctoral fellow at the MPI for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen and in the
Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey. I thank Steve Levinson
and Grev Corbett, respectively, for their help and support.
    Special thanks go to Don Gardner who first got me interested in working
on Mian. Don has been working as an anthropologist with the West Mianmin
for the last 30 years and I was lucky to be able to profit from his knowledge
and connections in Papua New Guinea. Don accompanied me on my first trip
for a couple of weeks, introduced me to the people and was generally an
invaluable help for me to adjust to the unfamiliar environment.
    The first one and a half months of my first field trip I spent in Yapsiei
station. I would like to thank Tesinab Balabe, with whom I worked there, and
Atupe, Father Ben and Father Albino of the Yapsiei mission station, Milan
Janda, who was researching moths in the area and who let me use his satellite
phone, and the kiap of Telefomin District Ricky Yentop Yaman.
    Further, I thank the National Research Institute of Papua New Guinea in
Port Moresby, especially Jim Robins, and the Provincial Government of
Sandaun Province in Vanimo, especially Eugene Raire and Ignatius Litiki.
    I thank Bernard Comrie and Bill Foley, the examiners of my dissertation,
for many critical comments and helpful suggestions which I incorporated into
the present book.
    Matthew Dryer, the cognizant editor for the Mouton Grammar Library,
closely read the whole manuscript. I am very grateful for his insightful
comments which made me change many aspects of the description and the
analysis and which thus greatly improved the quality of the grammar.

The language and its speakers
1.0.     IntroductionThe term Mian is not a native Mian word. Nevertheless, it is nowadays used as
an ethnonym and a logonym and as a toponym for the airstrip near the
Mianmin settlements Timeilmin and Temsakmin. Traditionally, the Mianmin
had no term for their people but used group or clan names which were
compounded with the nominal stem tn ‘people’, e.g. Usalei-tn and Kmeil-
tn, denoting the Mian clans who today live in the settlements Gubil and
Timeilmin, respectively.
    The noun mian means ‘dog’ in the related Ok languages Faiwol and Bimin
(Healey 1964a: 85) and in the distantly related Oksapmin language (Lawrence
1972a, Lawrence 1972b, Loughnane 2009). The story goes that when a patrol
came to Telefomin District in the mid 1930s and asked for information about
the people living towards the north and west of the Telefomin area, who
afterwards became known as the Mianmin, they learned the name ‘Mian’,
possibly because the Mianmin had a reputation as fierce warriors. This name
subsequently became the standard designation for the people under the
colonial administration and later was adopted by the Mianmin people
themselves. The Oksapmin know a mythical story of how the Mianmin got
their name. Near Oksapmin station there is a rock face amidst the rain forest
covering the steep wall of a mountain ridge. According to Oksapmin myth,
that was the place where a bitch gave birth to the first Mianmin in days of
yore. From there, they moved westward into lower altitude regions, into the
traditional and contemporary Mianmin area.1
    Linguists of the Summer Institute of Linguistics generally used the terms
‘Mianmin’ or ‘Oksapmin’ both as ethnonyms and language names. This
terminology gained wider currency through the classic literature on Papuan
languages (Wurm 1982, Foley 1986). Originally, the Mianmin called their
language wéng, which polysemously means ‘sound, voice, speech, language’.
Nowadays, they use Mian wéng ‘Mian language’. Most names of inhabited
places are compounds ending in am ‘house’, such as Mian-am ‘Mianmin’,
Temsel-am ‘Temsakmin’, Klefol-am ‘Telefomin’, Oksab-am ‘Oksapmin’ or in
bib ‘village, hamlet, place’, e.g. Kondu-bib, Skio-bib. I will use the term
‘Mian’ for the language (as an abbreviation of Mian wéng) and ‘Mianmin’ as
the ethnonym and as the toponym signifying the area around Mianmin airstrip.
2      1. The language and its speakers1.1.        Mian wéng: The Mian languageMian (also known as ‘Mianmin’ or ‘Miyanmin’ in the literature, ISO mpt) is a
Papuan language of the Ok family. The term ‘Papuan’ is not to be understood
as a name for a well-defined language family but as a residue category for the
non-Austronesian and non-Australian languages of the south-west Pacific
(Foley 1986, 2000).
   The Ok family of languages belongs to the larger Trans New Guinea
(TNG) family, and is of roughly the same order of internal diversification as
Germanic within Indo-European (Healey 1964a, Wurm 1982, Pawley 2005).
The Ok languages are named after the widespread cognate ok ‘river, water’ in
these languages.2 Mian is spoken by fewer than two thousand people in the
north-west of Telefomin District in Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

in the verb form, followed by those cliticized illocutionary particles which
start with /b/, namely =be ‘declarative’, =bo ‘emphatic/quotative’, and =ble
‘Exclamative’, to avoid two /b/’s in sequence at the last syllable boundary
within the phonological word.(52)    bo       unín=o       ifu-b-eo=be/*ifubebbe
        2SG.F     food=N2      serve.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.F.SBJ=DECL
        ‘You (F) are serving food.’The function of the subject suffix alternation is solely to avoid a clash of two
/b/’s, if they constitute the coda of the penultimate and the onset of the last
syllable of a phonological verbal word. The language does not mind
heterosyllabic b-clash in any other position within a phonological word (cf.
example (57) below).
    In order to avoid b-clash, the second alternant (-ebo, -obo, -ibo) can be
used but only in forms either inflected with -n ~ Ø ‘Realis’ or -Vm ‘Deontic’:(53)    kbo      unín=o       ifa-n-ebo=be
        2SG.M     food=N2      serve.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
        ‘You (M) served food.’Instead of ifanebobe, one can use ifaneobe with the first subject suffix
alternant. Subject suffix alternation is independent of semantics. Compare:(54)             -maye            gò’-n-io=be/*gò-n-ib=be

        ‘They have cut themselves.’Whenever the subject suffix is followed by any other verbal suffix, e.g. a tense
suffix in the post-subject slot, as in (56) or the negative clitic =ba (57), the
third alternant must be used:(56)    kbo      unín=o      ifa-n-eb-so=be
        2SG.M     food=N2 serve.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-HPST=DECL

       2SG.F food=N2=NEG            serve.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=NEG=DECL
       ‘You (F) are not serving food.’The same applies if the subject suffix is followed by any illocutionary clitic
which does not start with /b/, for example the interrogative clitics =a and =e,
for example in the formulaic greeting in (58):(58)   klayâm         tl-Ø-eb=a?
       very_good      come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=Q
       ‘Did you arrive safe and sound?’ [Observed]The third alternant also appears in all final verbs in which the subject suffix is
the last morpheme, for example, before conjunctions or subordinators like
kesoa ‘because’, otâne ‘but’, and mole ‘if’, as in (59):(59)   amît=e            tala unê-b-ib                       kesoa
       opening=SG.N1     enter go.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ     because
       ‘because they were entering the opening, …’ [Dafinau]The issue arises here as to whether /o/ in the second alternant, e.g. -ebo
‘2SG.SBJ, is really part of the subject suffix. After all, it seems to occupy the
same slot as the hesternal past suffix -so in the verb form infanebsobe
‘yesterday you served food’ in (56) above and might therefore be another
tense suffix in the post-subject slot. Under negation, however, it is obvious
that /o/ is not a tense suffix in the post-subject slot because it does not show
up, whereas the tense suffix does. Compare:(60)   ifa-n-eb=ba=be/*ifanebobabe
       serve_food.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=NEG=DECL

       serve_food.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-HPST=NEG=DECL
       ‘Yesterday, you did not serve food.’The subject suffix -bio in the first person plural is only chosen over -uo if the
subject suffix follows the irrealis suffix:(62)   n           unín=o       dowôn’-omab-bio=be

subject slot. Although the first plural irrealis in -bio is the usual form in
contemporary Mian, old speakers still use the first alternant for first person
plural in -uo. The following example (63) is from an account of how spirit
houses were built in former times. The speaker is well over 80 years old:(63)     tl-omab-uo=be
         come.PFV-IRR.AN.PL.SBJ-1PL.SBJ=DECL
         ‘We would come.’ [Building a spirit house]In medial verbs, only the first alternants of the subject suffix -eb, -ob, and
-ib, are ever used. This can be explained phonologically. The second alternant
comes into play to avoid b-clash at the syllable boundary between the
penultimate and the last syllable of the verb. In medial verbs, the clitics =a
and =ta, which mark the verb as medial and which form the last syllable of the
phonological verbal word, never start with /b/. There can be no b-clash and
consequently the alternation of the subject suffix is never triggered.
    In two cases, there is solely phonologically conditioned allomorphy to
avoid */ii/ or */ui/ sequences, e.g. the subject suffixes which begin in /i/, -i
‘first person singular subject’ and -ib(o) ‘second/third person plural animate
subject’, are realized as -ei and -eib(o), respectively, if they attach to a stem
ending in a high vowel /i/ or /u/, such as ki ‘align, read’ or fu ‘cook’.
Therefore, the correct forms are kieibiobe ‘I read’ and fueibbiobe
‘you(PL)/they cooked’.","[288, 289, 290, 291]"

independent sentence or whole clause chain) for illocutionary force. The
inventory comprises:(195) =be        ‘Declarative’
      =bo        ‘Emphatic, quotative’
      =ble       ‘Exclamative’
      =a         ‘Question’
      =e         ‘(Content) Question’
      =o         ‘Hortative (first person singular and plural, third person
                 singular)’
          =e     ‘Hortative (second person singular, second/third person
                 plural)’All illocutionary clitics are discussed in 12.1. The interrogative clitics =e and
=a receive treatment under question formation in chapter 10. The hortative
clitics are described in 8.6.8.
    The illocutionary clitic =bo ‘Emphatic, quotative’ has three different
functions in Mian. First, it is used to mark embedded quotatives (see 13.1).
Second, while =be just signals that an utterance is declarative, =bo can be used
to make a statement more emphatic, especially under negation, as in (196):(196) nái=o                fiamî=e                fiamî=ba=bo
      vagina=SG.F          arrow_type=SG.N1       arrow_type=NEG=EMPH          toli=e                          tem=e

          ‘they pierced her vagina on a Fiami arrow – not a Fiami arrow – a
          Toli arrow, and then …’ [Initiation ritual]Third, =bo is used in clause chains to indicate that the event described in the
following clause comes as a surprise. In this function it only occurs following
a medial verb form of the intransitive verb têm’/temê’ ‘have a look’, for
example:

3.13.2.     Medial verb cliticsThe medial verb marker =a cliticizes to medial verbs in clause chains. It is
probably derived from the coordinating conjunction eka ‘and’. There is a
second medial verb marker =ta which I assume is a clitic sequence of an
unidentified element =t and the medial verb marker =a. The semantic
difference between =a and =ta is unclear and hence both are glossed as MED
‘medial’. Some speakers use =to instead of =ta.","[182, 183, 184]"

(see 9.10.5).

Verb morphology
8.0.      IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
    Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They cross-
reference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
    The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
    Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
    It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
    Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.
244    8. Verb morphology8.1.     Classification of verbsVerbs can be classified according to three criteria, namely position in the
sentence, possibility of direct inflection, and finiteness. A further division in
four conjugation classes will be made in 8.4.
    First, finite verbs can either be directly inflected for various TAM
categories or serialized with an auxiliary. See 8.6.1 on directly inflected verbs
and 8.6.7 on auxiliary-serialized verbs.
    Second, finite verbs are either final or medial. Mian is a clause-chaining
language. Simple sentences contain one final verb, whereas complex
sentences usually consist of clauses chained together, each of which contains a
medial verb while the last clause in a given chain, which forms the end of the
sentence, terminates with a final verb. All final verbs index their subjects and
any of the object(s) that this verb has to index, and can be inflected for all
TAM categories, while medial verbs are slightly more restricted in terms of
their TAM morphology. Medial verbs cannot be inflected for irrealis or
deontic mood. Furthermore, they are never marked for polarity or
illocutionary force. Tense marking with -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal
past’ on medial verbs is possible. Medial verbs partake in the switch-reference
system of the language. They are inflected for same or different subject, i.e.
they have suffixes which mark whether or not the subject of the following
clause is the same. The same suffixes also indicate sequentiality or
simultaneity of events.
    Third, verbs are either finite or non-finite. Any verb (or serial verb
construction) marked for subject is finite, any verb not marked for subject is
non-finite.
    As medial verbs and their morphology are intricately linked to the
phenomenon of clause-chaining, their morphology is described in section 10.2
under clause-chaining constructions.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"

Embedding
13.0.     IntroductionMian has four types of embedded structure. These are:-   quotative sentences
-   adverbial clauses
-   head-internal relative clauses
-   prenominal relative clausesThese four structures can be distinguished with respect to their syntactic
category and the structures into which they are embedded.
    Quotatives are full sentences, i.e. they receive marking for illocutionary
force, e.g. =bo for quotatives, =a for embedded polar questions, =e for
embedded content questions, or =e ~ =o ‘hortative’. These are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’.
    Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses display clausal syntax
but are formally marked as noun phrases, i.e. they occur with a proper subset
of the determiners which fill the determiner slot in ordinary noun phrases. It is
quite typical for Papuan languages to treat adverbials and relatives formally
the same, the functional reason for this being that both types of clause provide
background information (Foley 1986: 202).
    Prenominal relative clauses are embedded within noun phrases. They do
not receive any overt marking. There is no subordinator, determiner and no
illocutionary marking.
    Embedded structures are on a different syntactic level with respect to their
matrix clauses because in complex sentences, embedded clauses are skipped
by the switch reference (S/R) morphology operating in the main clause, i.e.
S/R is calculated with respect to the next clause after the embedded structure.
    Verbs in simple embedded clauses are morphologically very similar to
independent sentence-final verbs, e.g. both the former and the latter can be
inflected for irrealis mood whereas medial verbs cannot. All embedded
structures can be complex themselves. They can consist of a clause chain
themselves. In such cases, the last clause has a final verb and all clauses in the
embedded chain have medial verbs with S/R morphology pertaining only to
subject tracking and to the temporal structure of the events in the embedded
clause chain. In other words, S/R morphology only tracks subjects across
486       13. Embeddingclauses on the same syntactic level. Subject-tracking never reaches into
embedded clauses or out of embedded clauses into the matrix clause.
   Verbs in embedded quotatives are always fully independent of any
information marked on the final verb in the matrix clause. Verbs in embedded
adverbials and relative clauses are only minimally dependent on the matrix
verb in that it always has to have the same illocutionary force value. This
dependency is familiar from clause chains. Unlike medial clauses, however,
verbs in embedded adverbial and relative clauses have their own TAM value
and are independent of any negation on the matrix verb, as shown in (1).
Adverbial clauses are “impervious to denial from such following clauses”
(Haiman 1980: 142), e.g.:(1)       bomânomo        balubib=e        aai=e
          tomorrow        airstrip=SG.N1   water=SG.N1          êi-n-em-e=o
          accumulate-AUX.PFV-COND-3SG.N1.SBJ=N2          balu=e=mo                tl-aamab-e=ba=be
          plane=SG.N1=NEG          come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ=NEG=DECL
          ‘If tomorrow the airstrip accumulates water, the plane won’t come.’Habitual marking likewise never extends to an adverbial clause. The hitting of
cats cannot be interpreted as habitual in (2):(2)       kbo        busi   i-nâ’-n-em-eb=o
          2SG.M       cat    PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-AUX.PFV-COND-2SG.SBJ=N2                     meou        ga-bina-b-io=be

          ‘If you hit a cat, it (habitually) meows’ [TMA questionnaire, 75]
13.1.       Embedded quotatives13.1.1.     Quotatives as sentential complementsQuotative sentences are used to represent discourse. They are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’. Verbs
in simple embedded quotative sentences display final verb morphology and
either take a clitic =bo ‘Quotative’, as in (3), or have a hortative verb form

        should go to Gubil.”, he said to me.’)The function verb which takes the quotative as a complement is usually
serialized with another verb specifying the mode of expression, e.g. baa ‘say

    Embedded quotatives can be preceded by an ‘introductory’ medial clause
whose verb specifies the mode of expression, e.g. baa-n-e=a ‘he says’ or
funa-n-i=a ‘I think’. This medial verb has to be in the perfective. This is
illustrated by the examples (3) to (7). This ‘introductory’ medial clause is not
obligatory and can be left out without creating a difference in meaning. The

is obvious that subject co-reference is not calculated with respect to the

   An example with a transitive verb in the embedded quotative is given in

4.7.     EvaluationAn analysis of the Mian gender system as a two-class system makes sense of
the striking patterns of homophony in the agreement markers by treating =e
and =o as exponents of the masculine and the feminine gender, respectively.
    Above, we have seen that an analysis of Mian gender in terms of masculine
and feminine gender entails that we have to accept that for animate referents
gender operates independently of number, whereas (at least) for inanimates
that allow a number opposition, a contrast in number or quantity is expressed
by means of a contrast in gender. In such a system a change in number results
in a change in gender and vice versa, conflating the categories number and
gender for these inanimate nouns.
    It is my view that such an analysis should be rejected in general and in
Mian in particular because despite the patterns of homophony, gender and
number are different phenomena and should therefore be kept separate in a
synchronic description of a language. Gender is a lexical feature of a noun.
Evidence for this assumption comes from the fact that assignment can be
arbitrary and agreement is strict and consistent. Number, on the other hand, is
generally not a feature a noun is inherently specified for though there are
exceptions, for example suppletive or irregular plural stems and pluralia
tantum, such as scissors or oats in English, which are indeed lexically plural,
but rather a feature of the noun phrase as a whole in a certain context in which
it is used to denote a plural referent. It might be possible to argue that in
English most count nouns are inherently singular because the form of their
lexical entry is identical to the singular form. In Mian, however, a lexical
citation form, e.g. naka ‘man’, is unspecified for number. Only the addition of
a determiners, e.g. the articles =e or =i clarifies whether one man or more that
one is/are being referred to.
    A two-gender analysis would have ramifications for the structure of the
Mian lexicon. Each of the two genders would contain both animate and
inanimate nouns and the entries for animates would differ considerably from
those for inanimates. While animate nouns can be specified for either gender
(mostly depending on sex) and then regularly have their plural marked with
184    4. Gender=i, some inanimates, such as imen ‘taro’, would need a feature ‘polaric’,
which indicates that the noun shows gender polarity when its number value is
changed. We cannot assume a general rule that makes all inanimates polaric
because some, such as káawa ‘steel axe’, do not show gender polarity and
therefore would have to be specified as invariant. Consequently, even a two-
gender analysis has to make a sub-classification within each gender, in other
words, it has to make reference to both gender and animacy to account for the
gender and number behaviour of any given noun.
   In summary, the two-gender analysis is plagued by the fact that it has to
assume polarity as a principle of Mian grammar. Furthermore, it is not more
parsimonious than the four-gender analysis since it also has to acknowledge a
four-way contrast. Hence, the solution I propose for Mian is to adopt the four-
gender analysis because it permits us to keep number and gender separate.
Rather than saying that a given inanimate noun, such as imen ‘taro’ is
masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, this noun is lexically
specified as neuter 1, which forces the article to be =e in the singular and =o
in the plural. In other words, the correct agreement patterns follow directly
from the lexical gender specification of the noun.

Classificatory verb prefixes
5.0.      IntroductionA subset of the Mian verbal vocabulary (approximately 35 roots) requires a
classificatory prefix whose function is (a) to index the object of transitive
verbs and the subject of intransitive verbs and (b) to classify the object/subject
according to certain salient characteristics of its referent, namely sex, shape,
and function.
    Semantically, these verbs (with a few exceptions) refer to various forms of
manipulation, movement, and handling, for example ‘give’, ‘take’, ‘put’, ‘lift’,
‘turn’ ‘throw’, ‘bury’, and ‘fall’. As suggested by their semantics, most of
these verbs are transitive and their verbal prefixes have a classificatory
relation to the object, exceptions being the intransitive verb -mêin ‘fall’ and
the ambitransitive verb -bià ‘throw, erupt’, which can be used intransitively to
mean ‘erupt’. In these two cases the classification applies to the subject. Thus,
classificatory prefixes in Mian operate on an absolutive basis (Keenan 1984),
e.g.:(1)    báangkli=e          dob-ò-n-o=a
       stone_adze=SG.N1 3SG.M_CL.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
       ‘she took the báangkli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam](2)    Dabein   om-mêin                   tl-Ø-o=ta
       PN       3SG.F_CL.SBJ-fall.PFV     come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
       ‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]Interestingly, it is precisely verbs of handling and object manipulation which
contain classificatory elements in a number of North American languages
which also operate on an absolutive basis, e.g. Navajo and Digueño (Hoijer
1945, Langdon 1970, Barron 1982).","[209, 210, 211]"
"
9.13.      A note on causativesLike many languages, Mian has lexical causatives where an intransitive verb
and its causative counterpart are realized as distinct lexical verb stems:(154) Intransitive                 Causative
      ein ‘cook’                   fu ‘cook’
      kaan ‘die (PFV)’             -nâ’ ‘kill (PFV)’
      bokbok ge ‘boil (PFV)’       bafu ‘boil’In addition to this, ambitransitive verbs have a causative element as part of
their meaning when used transitively, cf. halò ‘break (intransitive) vs. halò
382    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause‘(cause to) break (transitive)’ or dòu ‘close (intransitive)’ vs. dòu ‘(cause to)
close (transitive)’. On ambitransitives, see 9.3.
    There is no morphological causative. The syntactic causative construction
is a special form of verb serialization consisting of (exactly) two verbs, where
subject marking is used to index the causer on the first verb and the causee on
the second verb. For more information on causative serializations, see 11.1.5.
An example of a causative serialization is given in (155):(155) geim=e                          tob-â’-i
      pronged_arrow=SG.N1             3SG.LONG.O-let_go.PFV-1SG.SBJ       un-Ø-e=be
       go.PFV-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
       ‘I dropped the pronged arrow.’ (lit. ‘I let go of the arrow and it
       went.’)What I would like to do in the remainder of this section is to discuss one case
that has been identified as the “Mian causative construction” in the literature.
Smith and Weston (1974b: 138) claim that: “[t]he verb kimanin ‘watch over,
command’ is used in the first clause of a sequence sentence [i.e. a clause
chaining construction – SF]” to indicate a cause-effect relation. They give one
example. Morpheme breakdown, glosses and translation are Smith and
Weston’s (1974a: 139):6(156) awok-o           men-e         ki-mab-o               a     aay-e
      mother-CM        child-CM      command-FUT-she        SEQ   water-CM       fuela-n-a-mab-e        bo
       bathe-PU-NU-FUT-he     IND.EMPH
       ‘The mother will command the child and he will bathe.’ i.e. ‘The
       mother will make the child bathe.’Based on Smith and Weston’s data and glosses Song (1996: 36-37) classifies
the construction in (156) as an overt AND type of causative in his typological
survey of causatives, i.e. a biclausal construction with an overt coordinating
element, in this case a ‘sequential’ connecting the clauses specifying cause
and effect. Before going into the question whether this construction is really a
causative, the morphological analysis has to be corrected.
   First, Smith and Weston analyse -mab in kimabo erroneously as a future
form though medial verbs in Mian are never inflected with -mab (which I
gloss as ‘irrealis’). Although they do not explicitly say so, no forms inflected
                                               9.13. A note on causatives   383with -mab appear in their table summarizing the morphology of the medial
verb nor do any of their examples have medial verbs inflected with -mab.
   Second, the verb involved is not ki but rather is kimâa’ ‘watch over (PFV)’
(with a pharyngealized /a/). This verb cannot be inflected directly in the
imperfective but needs an auxiliary before it can be inflected (cf. the verbal
noun kimâa’-nin ‘(activity of) watching over’, where nin is the verbal noun of
the existential verb).
   My analysis of (156) above is:(157) awók=o           mn=e
      mother=SG.F      child=SG.M       kimâa’-bi-Ø-o=a7
       watch_over.PFV-AUX.IPFV-DS.SIM-3SG.F.SBJ=MED       aaie     fuela-n-amab-e=bo
       water    bathe.PFV-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-3SG.M.SBJ=EMPH
       ‘While the mother is watching over the child, it will bathe.’The second issue with Smith and Weston’s analysis is semantic in nature.
Although it is true that the verbal noun kimâa’nin can be used as a noun with
the meaning ‘boss, minder’, the verb stem kimâa’ essentially means ‘watch
over, look out for (PFV)’ and not ‘command’. There is not a single instance in
my corpus where kimâa’ could be felicitously translated as ‘command’. In my
view, it is mainly the glossing of kimâa’ as ‘command’ that suggests that we
are dealing with a causative construction.
   Furthermore, even the assumption of a potential causative construction
with kimâa’ ‘watch over (PFV)’ in a medial clause indicating causation, is not
supported by my data. Nowhere does the clause following a medial clause
with kimâa’ express an effect related to a causer, who would be the subject of
kimâa’.
   To conclude, I am very sceptical as to whether a causative analysis of the
construction in (157) is valid. Such constructions may have a causative
implicature at best but they are not dedicated causatives.
Chapter 10
Question formation
10.0.      IntroductionThis chapter deals with the formation of questions. Formally, there are five
different types of question in Mian. Questions can employ:1)      only the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence
2)      bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentence, and no interrogative clitic =a
3)      the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence and
        bleka ‘or’ inside the sentence (separating two alternatives)
4)      the interrogative illocutionary clitic =e plus an interrogative phrase with
        either fàb ‘where’ or wan ‘who’
5)      the topic clitic =leFunctionally, these can be assigned to the following types:
    Types (1) and (2) are polar questions, i.e. questions for which the
appropriate answer is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
    Type (3) are alternative questions, where the speaker wants a specification
of the offered alternatives, e.g. Do you want pork or fish for dinner?.
    Type (4) are content questions, which are used to request information about
the who, what, when, etc. of an event or action. Content questions consist of a
proposition which is completely presupposed apart from one element, which is
the one queried (Givón 1990: 714-715). In Mian, the maximum number of
queried constituents is one. Thus, multiple constituent questions, such as
English Who did what?, are not possible.
    Type (5) are topic-only questions, in which only a topic is given, as in
English What about John? or And you?. The speaker has a particular question
in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied question is.","[407, 408, 409, 410, 411]"

with bare fàb is never marked with the interrogative clitic =e:

       ‘Where did you do (it)?’Fàb can be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier as well. In its
adnominal use, it follows the noun with which it forms the interrogative
phrase and means ‘which’ rather than ‘where’, e.g.:(26)   am=o         fàb       áa un-omab-bio=ne?

word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’. Fatnà ‘do what?’ can be inflected as a

          do_what-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
          ‘What are you doing?’ [Observed]There is a case to be made that fatnà is best analysed as an interrogative pro-
verb, i.e. as a single root which contains both a verbal and an interrogative
meaning. Such interrogative pro-verbs can be found in Papuan languages, e.g.
Kuot (Lindström 2002), Austronesian languages, e.g. Paamese (Crowley
1982) and Australian languages, e.g. Kayardild (Evans 1995: 371-372) and
Dyirbal (Dixon 1972). Outside the Pacific area, interrogative verbs can for
example be found in West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) (Sadock 1984: 206).
   In Paamese, there is an intransitive monomorphemic interrogative verb
kosaa ‘do what’, which is not segmentable into an interrogative and a verbal
element (Crowley 1982: 159).
   For Kayardild, Evans (1995: 371) analyses the pro-verb ngaakawatha ‘do
what’ as an inchoative form of the interrogative word ngaaka ‘what/who’.
Here, the pro-verb is derived from an interrogative word with the suffix
-watha which derives verbs from nominals (Evans 1995: 282).
   The degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal element in
fatnà is relatively low. The interrogative word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’
can still clearly be discerned. /b/ goes to [t] before the alveolar nasal /n/. This
form of place assimilation applies across the board in Mian and is thus not
necessarily indicative of a beginning fusion between the interrogative and the
verb stem.
   On the other hand, there is a semantic shift of the interrogative word fàb
from ‘where’ to ‘what’ in fatnà. Bare fàb cannot mean ‘what’, while fatnà
cannot mean ‘do where’. It contrasts with fàb na ‘do where’. As the meaning
of fàb is clearly construction-specific here, the meaning of fatnà cannot be
said to be fully transparent anymore. Also, the [t] in the interrogative verb
ftna is often elided in normal and fast speech to yield fanà ‘do what’. I
therefore analyse fatnà as an interrogative pro-verb, albeit one with a low
degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal part.
   The core meaning of fatnà is ‘do what’:(28)      n      ul        lo                 dowôn’-aam-i=o

is closer to ‘why’, as in (29) or ‘how’, as in (30):(29)                  fanà-n-o=ta

       ‘How has he escaped me?’ [Klebein]
       (lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on me?’)The last two examples also shed some light on the syntactic and
morphological behaviour of fatnà in content questions.
   First, these forms function as verbs and are heads of their own clauses as
can be seen in (29), which consists of a medial clause  fatnànota and a final
clause besao mebone. This is captured in the literal translations above. Like
medial verbs, inflected fatnà is subject to the usual inflectional restrictions for
medial verbs, namely that they cannot be marked for polarity or for irrealis or
deontic mood.
   Second, the bare stem fatnà can appear in shortened medial clauses under
subject identity as in (30). If the verb in the following clause has the same
subject, Mian medial verbs can be shortened to just the stem which is marked
as a medial verb by the clitic =ta (see 11.2.13).
   Therefore, fatnà ‘do what’ is a morphologically and syntactically regular
verb in many respects. It can also form hortative verb forms (31) and appear in
purposive serializations (32):(31)    fatnà-n-an=e?

          ‘You go to do what?’
10.2.4.     The verbal noun fatnàmin ‘what’The interrogative word fatnàmin has the basic meaning ‘what’. As an isolated
utterance, fatnàmin is interpreted as ‘what’, ‘why’, or ‘how’. Unlike a
question with bare fàb, a question with fatnàmin can optionally be marked
with the content question clitic =e:(33)      fatnàmin?/ fatnàmin=e?    ‘What (is it)?’/‘Why (is it)?’/‘How (is it)?’If fatnàmin appears in an argument position of a verb, as in (34), i.e. in the
position the argument constituent will have in an appropriate answer sentence,
as in (35), it means ‘what’:(34)      Q:    kbo      fatnàmin dowôn’-aamab-eb=e?
                2SG.M     what        eat.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=CQ

                ‘I want to eat pork.’As no interrogative containing fàb can ever be used to inquire about animates,
the argument position fatnàmin occupies is usually that of the object of the
verb.
   Inanimate subjects of the (intransitive) existential verb n/bi~bl, can be
queried by using fatnàmin:(36)      Q:    fatnàmin y      bi-Ø-e=ne?
                what       there stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=CQ

                 taro=SG.N1        there stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=DECL
                 ‘There is a taro (tuber).’In its adnominal use fatnàmin precedes the noun phrase and means either
‘what kind of’ or ‘how many’. Thus, the questions in (38) and (39) below are
                                                      10.2. Content questions     397ambiguous as to whether the speaker requests information about quality, i.e.
‘what kind of’, or quantity, i.e. ‘how many’. Generally, the context has to
disambiguate:(38)      fatnàmin lais         sm bi-Ø-e=ne?
          what     rice(TP) still stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=CQ
          ‘How much rice is still there?’ But also: ‘What kind of rice is still

          ‘What kind of house did he build?’ But also: ‘How many houses did
          he build?’In order to unambiguously express that they are interested to learn about
quantity and not quality or kind, younger speakers tend to use fatnàmin-fela
for ‘how much/many’. This construction is calqued from Tok Pisin hamaspela
‘how much/many’:(40)      fatnàmin-fela    tablaséb  unáng=i                wat

          ‘How many white women are over there?’ [Observed]Inquiring about quantities was presumably not a common activity in a society
which only had three basic numerals and by combining them counted to
around six or seven. Larger quantities were designated as ‘many’. I assume
that the meaning ‘how many’ for fatnàmin developed as a secondary sense
from ‘what, what kind of’.","[418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423]"

   Consider example (60) where three nouns – each with a pronominal article
– appear as subject, object, and possessor:(60)     nakamîn=e          imen=o         éil=e
         man=SG.M           taro=PL.N1     pig=SG.M         wen-ha-b-e=a

         ‘While a pig was eating a man’s taro, the man…’ [Pig story]The formatives under discussion are articles rather than overt number/gender
markers because they also indicate referentiality. The noun without the article
occurs in contexts in which the noun is used non-referentially, that is in any of
the following contexts:-     in the citation form, e.g. nakamîn ‘man, brother’, éil ‘pig’, imen ‘taro’,
      sók ‘rain’, kukub ‘way, custom’.
-     in generic object arguments in the citation form of (some) transitive
      verbs, e.g. as hakalin [wood break.IPFV.VN] ‘(activity of) breaking
      wood’
-     in first elements in N-N compounds, e.g. wan-am [bird-house] ‘bird
      blind’
-     in generic terms used to classify animals and plants, e.g. wan ‘bird’ in
      wan tolim [bird eagle] ‘New Guinea eagle (sc. Harpyopsis
      novaeguineae)’
                                                               3.3. Articles   111-   in non-verbal predications about identity, e.g. tíl=o=be
    [dog=PRD=DECL] ‘it’s a dog’
-   under negation, e.g. imen bl-im [taro exist-NEG] ‘there’s no taro’,
    yi=ba=be [wound=NEG=DECL] ‘it’s not a wound’This suggests that the article does not behave like overt gender or noun class
markers in many Australian or Bantu languages, in which a noun either
invariably has a certain marker or invariably lacks it, but rather functions as an
article marking the noun as definite-referential or indefinite-referential but is
left out if the noun is used non-referentially. However, there is a tendency to
leave out the article if the noun is inanimate even if it is used referentially.
    Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the
article to agree in gender with its noun. There is evidence that the article is on
the way of becoming a purely classificatory gender marker through the
extension of the form with article to non-referential contexts. Although the
form without article is the preferred choice under negation, as in
as bl-im [wood exist-NEG] ‘there’s no wood’, one also finds as=e bl-im
[wood=ARTICLE exist-NEG] with the same meaning. Greenberg (1978) shows
that across languages the definite article often winds up as a gender marker on
the noun after going through a grammaticalization process during which it is
increasingly used both as a definite article, meaning ‘the N’, and an indefinite
specific article, meaning ‘a specific N’ or ‘a certain N’. When the use of the
article becomes a function of the syntactic construction in which the noun
appears (e.g. negation), the original contrast between the form with article and
the form without article is lost and the distinction becomes redundant. At this
point the form with article usually starts to spread to all contexts. If this form
becomes universal in the language, the former article has become a gender
marker on the noun (Greenberg 1978: 63).
    Articles can follow all nouns, i.e. common nouns, proper names, dyads,
and temporal and verbal nouns (see section 3.1). Articles can also follow finite
verbs in head-internal relative clauses and adverbial clauses. In head-internal
relative clauses (61), the article agrees in number and gender with the noun. In
adverbials (62), the article is invariably =o. Square brackets indicate clause
boundaries:(61)   [no=i                    ya-l-êb

       ‘when the people grew up, they assumed names and then…’
       [Dimosson]Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses are discussed in 13.2 and
13.3 under embedding.
   Articles can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and follow the noun
and any adjectival modifiers. They can also follow numerals (see 6.3 for
details on modified and quantified noun phrases):(63)   tíl=e           milil=e          sm=e
       dog=SG.M        black=SG.M       big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’In (63), referentiality, number and gender are marked per article =e on the
noun and on each adjectival modifier. More common in natural discourse,
however, is to have only one article for the whole noun phrase, namely
following the rightmost modifier, for example:(64)   tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog black         big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’I analyse the article as a clitic rather than a suffix for the following reasons:
(a) Apart from nouns, articles can attach to adjectives and numerals and also
to verbs in adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses. (b) The
coordinating clitic =a (presumably a shortened form of eka ‘and’) usually
intervenes between the noun and the article in the last constituent of a
sequence of coordinate noun phrases:(65)   naka=i=a           unáng=a=i
       man=PL.AN=and      woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson]Articles are segmentally identical to the third person forms of the free
pronouns series, from which they are probably derived. Synchronically,
however, they differ from the pronouns in their suprasegmentals. While all
free pronoun forms are lexically specified for a high tone, articles are subject
                                                                3.3. Articles   113to suprasegmental phonological erosion, i.e. they are on the way to becoming
toneless. As lexical tone spreads to any toneless affixes and clitics, the
phonetic pitch value of the article depends on the lexical tone specification of
the noun (see 2.8.3.2).
    I assume three stages in this grammaticalization scenario. Contemporary
Mian is moving from stage (b) to stage (c):(66)     (a) naka  (lit. ‘man he’) > (b) naka= > (c) naka-e ‘a/the man’In the first stage (a), nouns were followed by a free pronoun which was
realized as a phonologically independent word. Synchronically, articles are
generally not realized as independent phonological words anymore, although
this still happens occasionally in very old speakers (over 80 years).
    In the second stage (b), the article encliticizes to the noun. Concomitantly,
suprasegmental attrition sets in.
    At the final stage (c), the vocalic formative will have developed into a
toneless nominal suffix.
    As the article is part of the phonological nominal word (even in very
careful speech), it is clear that the language has moved beyond the first stage.
However, one finds the pronunciations [na.ka. ] and [na.ka.] ‘a/the man’. In
the former, the article has its own high tone, in the latter it is toneless and low
tone is spread from the noun to the article. Articles which retain their own
high tone (characteristic of the second stage) and ones which are toneless
(characteristic of the third stage) occur in free variation.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"

3.2.     VerbsAs verbs are morphologically by far the most complex word class in Mian, I
will only be concerned with the defining features at this point and only give a
few examples to illustrate the most fundamental points about verb inflection in
Mian. For a detailed treatment of the morphology of the verb the reader is
referred to chapter 8.
    Loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian
verbs, but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in
a function verb construction:(36)             futbol        pilai        ke-b-io=be
       3PL.AN     football(TP) play(TP)      do-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They are playing football.’Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and impersonal
(atransitive) verbs. Transitives can be productively derived from intransitives
and ditransitives from transitives. On basic argument structures and derived
ones, see sections 9.1 to 9.7.
    Semantically, verbs refer to actions, processes, and states. Verbs fulfil the
function of the predicate of a clause.
    Suprasegmentally, verbs are either unaccented, in which case they are all-
low, or are lexically specified for an accent to which one of two complex tonal
melodies (either HL or LHL) is assigned. Nouns, on the other hand, are
associated with one of five tonal melodies.
    Syntactically, verbs are easily identified. Mian is an SOV language.
Although there is some pragmatically motivated variability with respect to the
position of subject and object, the last word in a clause is almost always the
verb and under no circumstances can the verb be followed by any of its
arguments. Occasionally, however, one finds locative adjuncts postposed after
the verb which are adverbial modifiers of the preceding verb syntactically, but
which form their own intonational unit (see 11.2.10).
    Morphologically, verbs can index their core arguments with pronominal
affixes cross-referencing subject (37) and object (38):

sections 3.14 on grammatical relations, 8.5 on argument marking, and 9.2 on
transitive verbs.
   Final verbs, i.e. verbs in independent sentences or in final clauses of clause
chains, can be inflected for various aspectual categories, e.g. -b ‘Imperfective’
(39), modal categories, e.g. -n ‘Realis’ (40), and temporal categories, e.g. -s
‘Remote past’ (41):(39)   sm     y         gen-b-i=be

for co- or disjoint reference of the subject in the succeeding clause in
combination with sequentiality or simultaneity of events. In (42), the suffix -b
‘DS.SIM’ indicates that the event described in the first clause is on-going
when the event described by the second clause takes place and that this second
clause has a different subject:(42)   gwáab=i          -maye                 dowôn’

       ‘the small (ones) themselves ate and (then) were going away, when
       a wild boar came’ [Afoksitgabáam]A subset of verbs, almost all of which make predications of handling or
movement, has an obligatory classificatory prefix which classifies one of the
arguments according to semantic characteristics, namely sex, form, and
function, on an absolutive basis. In (43), the object fukêt ‘smoking gourd’ is
classified as belonging to the residue class.(43)                     dab=o

       ‘the brothers took a smoking gourd’ [Danenok]About half of the verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with a
perfective/imperfective contrast. The rest are trans-aspectual, i.e. they have
only one stem which is vague with respect to aspect. A few verbs are defective
and lack either a perfective or an imperfective stem. Formally distinct
perfective and imperfective stems are subject to certain inflectional
restrictions, e.g. a perfective stem cannot be directly inflected for imperfective
aspect but has to enter an auxiliary construction. Trans-aspectual stems are not
restricted in terms of their inflectional morphology.
   For certain tense-aspect combinations, some verbs cannot be inflected
directly, but have to be serialized with the existential verb functioning as an
auxiliary before inflection can proceed:(44)   fu      unan-biaana-b-io=be

also frequently appear in serial verb constructions in which only the last verb
is fully inflected and all preceding verbs are either bare verb stems or stems
with affixes indexing any object(s) but lack TAM inflection or marking for

core or the nuclear level. See 11.1 for a detailed description of verb
serialization.
    Directionals can be directly inflected to form intransitive verbs of motion,

12.1.     Illocutionary forceOnly final verbs can be marked for illocutionary force. The set of illocutionary
markers consists of the clitics =be ‘Declarative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =bo
‘Quotative, emphatic’, =a ‘Question’, =e ‘(Content) Question’, and =o ~ =e
‘Hortative’. All of these have scope over the whole clause chain, e.g.:(1)                bín=o        we-n-e=a
        3SG.M       floor=N2     sweep-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED        unín=o       fu-n-e=be
        food=N2      cook-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He swept the floor and then cooked food.’In (1) the illocutionary particle =be marks the whole clause chain as
declarative. The first clause cannot be interpreted as having a different
illocutionary value, for instance, to construe it as a question: *‘Did he sweep
the floor?’ is impossible. Note though that the first clause on its own could
indeed be a question,2 provided it has the appropriate interrogative intonation:(2)              bín=o        we-n-e=a?
        3SG.M     floor=N2 sweep-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
        ‘Has he swept the floor?’Nonetheless, in (1) above an interrogative reading of the first clause is
impossible due to the scope of the marker of declarative illocutionary force on
the final verb.
   The same holds for the illocutionary markers =ble ‘Exclamative’ in (3),
and =bo ‘Quotative, emphatic’ in (4):(3)     wan     tiam=i            sangwân te-n-ib=a

       ‘ “I smashed her nose, so she died, so I put her down here”, she said
       and then someone else…’ [Afoksitgabáam]The illocutionary clitic =ble indicates that the whole of (3) is an exclamation
and =bo in (4) likewise expresses that all preceding medial clauses are
quotative, i.e. they represent what the woman said at that point in the story. On
quotatives as embedded structures, see 13.1.
   Markers of interrogative and hortative illocutionary force obey the same
scope rules. In order to turn the wohle of (1) above into a question, one can
replace =be ‘Declarative’ with =a to indicate a polar question:(5)               bín=o        we-n-e=a
       3SG.M       floor=N2     sweep-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED       unín=o      fu-n-e=a?
       food=N2     cook-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
       ‘Has he swept the floor and cooked food?’
       *‘He has swept the floor, and has he cooked food?’The verb in the medial clauses which precedes the final verb funea? ‘Has he
cooked (it)?’ is not marked as a question itself, but the scope rules for the
interrogative illocutionary clitic =a force an interpretation of the entire clause
chain as interrogative.
    In clause chains in which the final verb is marked as hortative by =e ~ =o,
scope is over the whole chain as well, e.g.:
474    12. Operator scope in clause chaining constructions(6)    deb-êt-n-i=a

       ‘ “I should take him and go and care for (him)!” ’
       *‘ “I took him and went and should care for him!’ ” [Afoksitgabáam]Although the verbs in the medial clauses which precede the final verb
sitanano ‘I should care for’ are not marked as hortatives themselves, the scope
rules force an interpretation of all these verbs as hortative.
    The illocutionary markers still have scope over the whole chain if the
subject reference changes. This is illustrated for hortative illocution in (7):(7)    alél     hat-wal=i

Illocutionary markers never have scope over other sentences apart from the
one in which they occur. Sentence boundaries are indicated by brackets in (8):(8)    [=le            y      kou-biaan-ib=ta

hortative marker =e does not have scope into or over the preceding quotative
sentence.","[498, 499, 500, 501]"

4.6.2.    PolaritySyncretism of forms across features is called ‘polarity’. In the Mian case, we
are dealing with (partial) gender polarity, i.e. for (countable) inanimates a
change in number means a change to an agreement pattern associated with a
different gender, e.g. imen ‘taro’ in the plural shows the same agreement
patterns as singular feminine nouns. The term ‘polarity’ refers to situations in
which in a “given system of two terms (grammatical features) and two
exponents, values and exponents can be inverted.” (Lecarme 2002: 110).
    For a (two-class) gender system this means that any given noun has a
certain gender in the singular with concomitant agreement patterning whereas
in the plural the same noun is used with the agreement patterns of the other
gender (as used in the singular). Polarity systems have been reported for
Cushitic languages, e.g. Somali (Serzisko 1982, Saeed 1999). The agreement
pattern of the definite article in Somali are set out in table 4.7 (from Saeed
1999: 112).",[207]

noun adjunct followed by a verb. The semantic relation can be opaque. Noun-
verb idioms are for example:(225) aaie fuela/aaie fua     [water bathe]             ‘bathe’
      abén gi/ abén gila      [laughter laugh]          ‘laugh’
      tamaan kou              [fornication copulate]    ‘fornicate, rape’
      usáan fu                [vomit cook]              ‘vomit’
      fètang kun              [carrion_smell smell]     ‘smell putrid’
      tamamèin klâ            [shock fix]               ‘be frightened’
      mma taa                [spittle spit]            ‘spit’What all of these have in common is that the noun preceding the verb
functions as an adjunct and not as an object. It does not have argument status.
Nominal adjuncts are highly restricted in their syntax. They have to
immediately precede the verb and cannot be modified with a relative clause.
Objects on the other hand can be fronted and modified with a relative clause.
   Within the noun-verb type of idiom, two cases have to be distinguished: (a)
the nominal adjunct can be omitted without a difference in meaning and (b)
omission of the adjunct results in a semantic change.
   An example of the first type is aaie fuela/aaie fua ‘bathe’, which still
means ‘bathe’ when aaie ‘the water’ is omitted:(226) fua-biaan-ib=to
      bathe.IPFV-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
      ‘while they were bathing, they…’ [Sobining]With the second type, the adjunct cannot be omitted without affecting the
semantics. Compare:(227) kou-we-b-e=a
      have_sex-3SG.F.R-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
      ‘while he was having sex with her, she…’ [Newlyweds](228) tamaan=o          kou-ye-b-ib=ta
      fornication=N2 have_sex-PL.AN.R-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
      ‘while they were raping them, …’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]
328     8. Verb morphology8.11.     The ‘Immediate action’ constructionMian has a special construction for immediate actions involving the function
verb ge/ga~gena ‘say’. It is used to express that the speaker desires or intends
to perform an action immediately after the moment of speaking or that an
event is about happen. In contrast to the coverb-function verb construction
with ge/ga ‘say’ (see 8.9 above), the imperfective stem gena is preferred over
ga in the immediate action construction, e.g.:(229) fút=e                  gíng=e
      tobacco=SG.N1          midrib=SG.N1        tob-tlâa’-n-ang-gena-b-i=be
        3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-REAL-IMMACT.NANPL.SBJ-say.IPFV-IPFV-
        1SG.SBJ=DECL
        ‘I’m about to remove the midrib of the tobacco leaf.’ [Rolling smokes]Apart from the suffix -ang ‘Immediate action (not animate plural subject)’ for
singular subjects, there is also -om ‘Immediate action (animate plural subject)’
for animate plural subjects. The latter suffix sometimes assimilates to the
following velar // and is realized as -ong:(230) un-om-ge-n-ob=a
      go.PFV-IMMACT.AN.PL.SBJ-say.PFV-SEQ-1PL.SBJ=MED
      ‘we wanted to go and then…’ [Ala ritual]Instead of the imperfective stem of the function verb gena~ga ‘say’ inflected
with -b ‘Imperfective’ one also finds the inchoative verb form with
-m in the same construction. There is no obvious difference in meaning, e.g.:(231) eka       imak=e             ybbaka
      and       husband=SG.M       as_well        dob-Øˆ-ang-gena-m-e

        because
        ‘because it (the water) was about to take the husband as well, …’
        [Flood]
                                  8.11. The ‘Immediate action’ construction   329The ‘Immediate action’-construction is very likely a reanalysis of an
embedded quotative construction (see 13.1). The erstwhile hortative suffixes
-an ‘1SG.HORT’ and -om ‘1PL.HORT’ are still discernible (see 8.6.8 on subject
marking in hortative forms). Compare (229) above to the following example
(232), which is also attested in synchronic Mian. The embedded hortative
sentence is given in brackets:(232) [fút=e                gíng=e
      tobacco=SG.N1         midrib=SG.N1       tob-tlâa’-n-an=o]
       3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT       gena-b-i=be
       say.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I think I should remove the midrib of the tobacco leaf.’There are several reasons why I set up ‘Immediate action’ as a distinct
construction. Speaker intuitions about word boundaries indicate that
tobtlâa’nanggenabibe ‘I am about to remove a long object’ as one word, while
tobtlâa’nano genabibe ‘I think I should remove a long object’ is judged to be
two separate words. This speaker judgment is supported by the fact that the
hortative subject suffix -an has assimilated to the following /g/ of ge/ga~gena
‘say’ and is always realized as -ang in the immediate action construction.
   More important, however, is that the former behaves like a single
phonological word (with one accent and one tonal melody), while the latter
consists of two separate phonological words.
   Morphologically, in embedded hortatives the subjects in the embedded and
the matrix clause can vary independently of each other, whereas this is not
possible in the ‘Immediate action’-construction. The identity of the immediate
action suffix is entirely predictable from the number and animacy of the
subject of the matrix verb. If the subject is singular, -ang is used, if it is
animate plural -om ~ -ong.
   Finally, the construction for immediate actions allows inanimate subjects,
e.g. the water in (229) above, while quotative constructions (whether
declarative, interrogative, or hortative) are restricted to subjects which have a
consciousness and are capable of intentional action.
Chapter 9
Argument structure and the syntax of the clause
9.0.        IntroductionThis chapter deals with the argument structure of the verb and with the order
of constituents in the clause. The unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV
in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses. While the verb is almost
always final in any clause (a marginal exception will be dealt with in 11.2.10),
the order of core arguments and adverbial adjuncts is less rigidly fixed.
    This chapter also contains sections on non-verbal clauses, reciprocals and a
note on causatives.
    Mian is head-marking at clause level (Nichols 1996). There is no
morphological case or adpositional marking for core grammatical relations.
Rather relevant syntactic relations are marked on the verb. Most arguments in
the clause, i.e. subjects, recipients, and for some verbs also the object, are
indexed on the verb by affixes.
    Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and
impersonal (or atransitive) verbs. Compounding with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ with a
quasi-applicative function is used as a valency-increasing device in the
perfective to derive transitives from intransitives and ditransitives from
transitives in a highly productive way. In the imperfective, recipient suffixes
are directly appended to a verb to increase its valency.
    The only clearly underived ditransitive verb in Mian is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’.
Underived ditransitives show triple agreement, i.e. they index the subject, the
object (the gift) and the recipient with an affix (see section 9.5 on
ditransitives).
    Ambitransitive verbs (Dixon 1994, 2002) can be used intransitively or
transitively without any derivational process.
    There are also a few impersonal verbs with an expletive subject marker,
which denote the arrival of morning and afternoon and the passage of time.
    All finite verbs must contain a subject suffix indexing the subject of the
verb, which in the rare case of impersonal verbs is an expletive (-o). This form
is homophonous to the third person singular feminine subject marker.
    I define the argument structures as follows:-      Intransitives have exactly one core argument (S).
-      Transitives have exactly two core arguments (both A and O).
-      Ditransitives have exactly three core arguments (A, O and R).
332      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause-      Ambitransitives have either one (S) or two core arguments (both A and
       O).
-      Atransitives (impersonal verbs) have no core arguments.","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358]"
"
11.1.    Serial verb constructionsMian serial verb constructions (SVCs) consist of several concatenated verb
stems. There are no markers of coordination, subordination, or of any
syntactic dependency. In a SVC, all verbs except the last one in the sequence
are verb stems, i.e. they are not marked for subject nor do they carry
information about tense or polarity. They can, however, index their own
objects in the form of affixes.
   Mian mostly has same-subject serializations (Crowley 1987: 38), i.e. all
verbs in a SVC share the same subject, which is cross-referenced on the last
verb in the sequence. The only notable exception are causative serializations,
which are of the type ‘I drop the arrow, it falls’. In these the subjects have to
be distinct.
406       11. Chaining constructions    The last verb in a SVC is a fully inflected verb according to the
morphological patterns of either medial or final verbs depending on whether
the SVC is the predicate of a medial or a non-medial clause (i.e. a final clause
in a clause chain or an independent sentence). Any information on
illocutionary force, polarity, or tense invariably has scope over the whole
SVC.
    An important structural distinction that is made for SVCs is at which
‘layer’ of the clause they occur. Foley and Olsen (1985) argue that verb
serialization can occur at either the nucleus or the core of the clause. The
different clause layers are distinguished by sets of operators pertaining to a
particular layer. For example, aspect operates at nucleus level and nominal
arguments at core level.
    Core SVCs in Mian allow verbs to have their own objects, whereas aspect
need not be shared. A nuclear SVC, on the other hand, has just a single object,
if it is transitive. Furthermore, the aspect value of the component verbs must
not be at variance. While it is possible for either stem to be trans-aspectual, it
is impossible that one is perfective and the other imperfective. This is not a
problem in core SVCs.","[431, 432]"

singular form is not identical to the feminine plural form.

principle which allows nouns to change their gender as a means of changing
their number. This, however, has consequences for linguistic theory, which
usually assumes gender and number to be two distinct categories or features.
An evaluation of a two-gender analysis for Mian taking into account its merits
but also the theoretical issues arising when one treats polarity as a
grammatical principle is given in the next section.","[208, 209]"

11.1.6.    Purposive serializationIn core and causative serializations, verbs are always ordered in a temporally
iconic way, i.e. that an event which chronologically precedes another one is
mentioned first.
   There is an exception to this general rule of temporal iconicity in SVCs. A
verb of motion can follow another verb to express that the movement takes
place for the purpose of an action. This reversal of temporal iconicity has to be
morphologically marked by using the perfective or imperfective M-form of a
verb, e.g. fuela-nam [bathe.PFV-PFV] ‘bathe (PFV)’ or fua-m
[bathe.IPFV-IPFV] ‘bathe (IPFV)’ rather than the bare stem.
   Compare the semantic difference between the purposive SVC in (29) and a
temporally iconic core SVC in (30):(29)      n      aaie     fuela-nam

          ‘I have come from bathing.’ (lit. ‘I bathed and came’) [Observed]If the motion verb in a purposive SVC is perfective, the meaning is that a
single bounded motion event has to be completed before the event which is
the purpose of the movement, which is expressed by the M-form, can take
place:

discussion of some unexpected semantic and functional inconsistencies in
switch reference marking, which have their origin in the fact that the Mian
switch reference markers are derived from the homophonous TAM markers
used in final verbs. The scope rules of operators, such as tense, polarity and
illocutionary force, an important and often overlooked topic in clause-chaining
languages, will be taken up in chapter 12.","[445, 446, 447]"

the feminine singular form is identical to the neuter plural form (meaning that
agreement is marked following the pattern for the feminine singular), whereas
the neuter singular and feminine plural forms are not identical. This situation
is similar to what we find in Mian.
    The important point is that the four-gender and the two-gender analysis for
Mian make profoundly different assumptions about what polarity actually is.
    For the four-gender analysis, polarity is a descriptive term for a situation in
which a noun in the plural follows the agreement pattern associated with
another gender in the singular without assuming that the gender of the noun
actually changes with a change in number, thus creating a special form of
syncretism which cross-cuts features. Corbett (1991: 196) uses the term in this
sense. For Mian, this means that we analyse four genders and state that
feminine and neuter 1 are in a relation of partial polarity with each other (table
4.9).",[208]

1.2.2.    Previous linguistic research on the Ok languagesEven today Ok remains a family of little known languages. Research on the
Ok languages was mainly conducted in the 1960s and 1970s by both linguists
and missionaries. Alan Healey’s dissertation (Healey 1964a) is a comparative
study of the Ok language family. He explores the historical development of
the Ok languages and reconstructs Proto Mountain Ok and Proto Lowland Ok
as common ancestor languages. Healey also provides short sections on Proto
Ok and Archaic Ok, in which he indicates the direction that a reconstruction of
the proto language would have to take. Although Healey does not attempt to
reconstruct tone for lack of reliable information, he highlights conspicuous
tone parallels for Mian, Telefol, and Tifal (Healey 1964a: 128 and table 3).
6      1. The language and its speakers    Voorhoeve’s (2005) genealogy is wider in scope. He examines the genetic
relationship of the Asmat-Kamoro, Awyu-Dumut and Ok families based on
regular sound correspondences in the daughter languages. A study of the
genetic relatedness of Oksapmin, which to date has been classified as an
isolate, and the Ok languages can be found in Loughnane and Fedden (2011).
    Previous linguistic work on Mian was done by Jean Smith and Pamela
Weston of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), two missionaries who
lived in Sokamin for 15 months and in Telefomin for several years where they
worked with visiting and live-in Mian speakers (my main consultant Kasening
Milimab among them). Smith and Weston published a two-part sketch
grammar, dealing with the phonology and the morphosyntax of the language,
respectively (Smith and Weston 1974a, 1974b). Apart from this sketch, Smith
(1977) published an article on sentence structure, and Weston (1977) one on
interrogatives. Smith and Weston (n.d.-a) is a compilation of this material with
some additional information on Mian discourse. Smith and Weston (n.d.-b) is
a sizable wordlist, which comprises approximately 2,000 entries, each with a
Mian headword and Tok Pisin and English glosses. Apart from indication of
word class, the wordlist contains no further grammatical information.
    Although Smith and Weston were not formally trained linguists and their
linguistic work has always been directed to the end of translating the complete
New Testament into Mian (Smith and Weston 1986), their grammar sketch,
i.e. Smith and Weston (1974a, 1974b), was invaluable as a starting point for
my own linguistic analysis of Mian.
    The only other Ok language described in greater detail is Telefol. Phyllis
and Alan Healey did research on Telefol phonology (Healey 1964b), noun
phrase (Healey 1965a), clause structure (Healey 1965b), verb phrase (Healey
1965c), and clause chaining constructions (Healey 1966). In addition to that,
the Healeys published an excellent dictionary (Healey and Healey 1977).
Their findings have never been published in a single volume.
    Materials on Tifal phonology can be found in Steinkraus (1963, 1969),
materials on Tifal grammar in Healey and Steinkraus (1972) and in Boush
(1975). For information on Faiwol, see Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg (1969,
1977) and Mecklenburg (1974).","[31, 32]"

3.7.12.   Note on indefinitesThere is no separate set of indefinite pronouns. Instead the adjective mak
‘other, some’ is used as a nominal modifier to express indefinite notions, for
example:(142) naka mak
      man some
      ‘some man, somebody (M)’(143) unáng    mak
      woman    some
      ‘some woman, somebody (F)’(144) am     mak      dim=o

140    3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.8.      DirectionalsDirectionals are an important and very variable category in Mian. They can be
used as adverbs or postpositions and be directly inflected to form verbs of
motion.
   All directionals primarily have spatial meaning and denote locations or
directions. They can never be combined. The inventory consists of six items:(145) ut~wit       ‘up(wards)’
      daak         ‘down(wards)’
      met          ‘upriver, up a little’
      tab          ‘downriver, down a little’
      wt          ‘across (a river or valley)’
      tm          ‘sideways, to the side (on same level)’Mian directionals are intimately linked to the topographical environment in
which the speakers of the language live. Figure 3.1 illustrates the basic
meanings of the directionals in relation to the topographical environment.                                 ut
                                                                  met

‘down’ and (b) the rivers Hak and Sek, which run roughly parallel to each
other near Mianmin, i.e. met ‘upriver’ vs. tab ‘downriver’.
    Directionals are also employed in small(er)-scale environments, in which
the directionals met ‘upriver’ and tab ‘downriver’ are not used with reference
to a river as a landmark but rather mean ‘up (a little)’ and ‘down (a little)’,
respectively.
    Locations around the upper part of the human body are commonly referred
to as ut, e.g. kwel ut [neck up] ‘up at the neck’, and locations around the lower
part as tab, e.g. kakam tab [buttocks down] ‘down at the buttocks’. However,
more systematic research in spatial deixis is needed for reliable
generalizations about the use of directionals in small-scale reference frames.
    Directionals are used for all locations inside and outside of the Mianmin
area. Selected example are: ut - Sokamin; daak - Oksapmin, Tabubil, Fiak,
Lae, and Germany; met - Tifalmin; tab - Gubil, Yapsiei, Hotmin, Green River;
tm - Ogisai; wt - Telefomin, Vanimo, Aitape, Port Moresby, and Australia.
Farther away locations show inter-speaker variation, for instance, one only
finds tab for Gubil, which is a six-hour walk downriver from Mianmin,
whereas the location of Germany or Australia are referred to by either daak or
wt.
    Directionals can be used as postpositions and adverbially. As postpositions
they follow a noun phrase. See also 7.1. They typically cliticize to their noun
host:(146) Skiobib tab
      PN       downriver
      ‘downriver in Skiobib’ [Dimosson]They can be marked with an article which agrees in number and gender with
its nomnial complement. In such a configuration, the postposition does not
cliticize, e.g.:(147) kwel       ut=o
      neck(F) up=SG.F
      ‘up at her neck’ [Selimin]In their adverbial use, directionals indicate that a movement event specified by
a verb of motion takes place in a certain direction. In this case, the directional
comes immediately before the verb:

      ‘The Telefomin people came down and then …’ [Mianmin and
      Telefomin]Furthermore, all directionals can be inflected directly to form intransitive
verbs of motion. For details on this special type of inflection, see 9.1.2 on
motion verbs.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

3.10.     QuantifiersThe class of quantifiers comprises homòn ‘many, much’, alukûm ‘all, every,
each’, and alik ‘all, every, each’, plus all numerals. Numerals and homòn
‘many, much’ always follow the noun that is being counted and all its
adjectival modifiers. The quantifiers alukûm and alik can occur before or after
the noun phrase they quantify.
    Mian does not have a set of formally distinct ordinal numbers nor does it
allow the use of cardinal numbers as ordinals.
    Basic numerals are:(156) elekiêm~eleyêm           ‘one (M, N1)’
      olokiêm~oloyêm           ‘one (F, N2)’
      asú/asusûna              ‘two’
      asumâtna                 ‘three’The pronouns from the free ‘alone’-series elekiêm (also eleyêm) ‘only he/it
alone’ and olokiêm (also oloyêm) ‘only she/it alone’ (see 3.7.7) double as the
numeral ‘one’, depending on gender. The numeral obligatorily agrees in
gender with the noun which is being counted:(157) naka=e        elekiêm
      man=SG.M      one.M
      ‘one man’ OR ‘only the man alone’(158) unáng=o         olokiêm
      woman=SG.F      one.F
      ‘one woman’ OR ‘only the woman alone’The numerals asú ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’ can occur with an article
reflecting the number and the gender of the counted noun but are often bare.
Asú ‘two’ has a variant asusûna, which looks like a partial reduplication of the
simple numeral asú. Nonetheless, asusûna also means ‘two’ rather than ‘four’:
                                                        3.10. Quantifiers   145(159) unáng=i               asú(=ei)/asusûna(=i)
      woman=PL.AN           two
      ‘two women’The numeral asusûna ‘two’ is (at least historically) segmentable into the
(partially reduplicated) numeral asusû and na. The latter is possibly derived
from the verb na ‘do’. Thus, asusûna ‘two’ would have been a verbal
predicate meaning ‘are two (lit. ‘do two’)’. The same holds for asumâtna
’three’, which consists of asú ‘two’, mak ‘(an)other’ and na ‘do’. Hence,
asumâtna probably used to mean ‘be two and another’:(160) unáng=i              asumâtna(=i)
      woman=PL.AN          three(=PL.AN)
      ‘three women’ (lit. ‘two women and another’)As the element na in numerals synchronically cannot be inflected as a verb, I
do not see any plausible reason to analyse the Mian numerals asusûna ‘two’
and asumâtna ‘three’ as verbs. I assume that the erstwhile verb stem na ‘do’ is
synchronically a part of the lexemes asusûna ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’.
   The numerals asú ‘two’, asusûna ‘two’, and asumâtna ‘three’ can be
collocated with the function verb ke ‘do’ to express that a group consists of a
certain number of individuals:(161)       Klefolam asú ke-bl-Ø-io=be
      3PL    PN           two do-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL

        play-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They are three of them playing.’ (lit. ‘They are three and they
       are playing.’)The numerals for numbers larger than three are phrasal. The rationale for
forming such phrasal numerals is stringing together instances of asú=ke ‘two
and’ (i.e. the numeral asú ‘two’ plus the light verb ke ‘do’ serving as a
coordinator in phrasal numerals) as many times as needed to count to an even
number and rounding this off by make ‘(one) other’ for odd numbers.
Examples are:

      asúke asúke asúke         ‘six’        [two+two+two]Phrasal numerals can occur with na, as in (164), or without na, as in (165),
depending on whether they are followed by the article, which is always
optional for numerals. Compare:(164) memé(=i)                asú=ke     asú=ke make          na=i
      children(=PL.AN)        two=and two=and another do=PL.AN
      ‘five children’ (lit. ‘two and two children and another’)(165) unáng=i              asú=ke      asú=ke
      woman=PL.AN          two=and     two=and
      ‘four women’ (lit. ‘two and two women’)With regard to example (164), memé(=i) asú=ke asú=ke make ‘five children’
would also be possible, but not *memé(=i) asú=ke asú=ke mak=i because
phrasal numerals are fixed expressions. For odd numbers the form make
‘(an)other’ is used regardless of the gender of the counted entity. The segment
// in make is an article indicating gender but it has frozen in the form for the
third person singular.
    In asumâtna ‘three’ [< asú mak na ‘two another do’] the final consonant in
mak ‘other’ has assimilated in place of articulation to the following nasal. It
seems that synchronically asumâtna is not analysed as asú ‘two’ and mak
‘other’ anymore. Especially younger speakers also use asú=ke make for
‘three’ (lit. ‘two and another’), thus regularizing the rules for counting to
include ‘three’.
    It is not difficult to see how this counting method can get quite
cumbersome very quickly for the speakers, who nowadays operate with large
exact numbers on a regular basis. Consequently, Tok Pisin numerals have
replaced the traditional ones, roughly from six upwards, e.g.:(166) memé=i                   fiftin           y
      children(PL)=PL.AN       fifteen(TP)     there       tl-Ø-io=be
       come.PFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Fifteen children came.’Younger speakers also use a digit-based system in which numbers with more
than one digit are broken down and each digit is rendered in the traditional
                                                             3.10. Quantifiers     147counting system with a short pause between the digits, e.g. elekiêm blim ‘ten’
(one nothing), elekiêm asúke asúke make ‘fifteen’ (one five), or asúke asúke
blim ‘forty’ (four nothing).
   Instead of a numeral denoting an exact figure, the quantifier slot in the
noun phrase can be filled by homòn ‘many’, with which speakers do not
commit to a certain number:(167) tíl=i         milil=i              sm=i          homòn=i
      dog=PL.AN     black=PL.AN          big=PL.AN      many=PL.AN
      ‘many big black dogs’Contrary to Healey’s (1964a) claim, Mian indeed has a body-tally system
based on the number 27, as it is typical for the other Mountain Ok languages.
Healey writes:   All of the Ok languages except Minamin [sic!] and Wagarabai [i.e. the west
   Mian dialect – SF] appear to use the round-the-body method of counting.
   When counting, a person points successively to various parts of the body, and
   the numerals mostly consist of some recognizable form of the body-part
   names. One circuit of the body is a counting unit. Large numbers are
   specified as so many units (circuits) plus such-and-such a number (body-
   part). (Healey 1964a: 65)Counting in the Mian tally system commences with the left thumb, followed
by the fingers of the left hand, then up the left side of the body (wrist, forearm,
elbow, shoulder joint, shoulder, cheek, ear, eye, nose) each time adding one,
so that one reaches 14 when touching the nose. From there, counting proceeds
down the right side of the body (the pointing is done with the other hand now)
till the whole procedure ends with the thumb of the right hand and the number
27. Smith and Weston (1974b: 50-52) report that speakers become
increasingly vague while counting down the right-hand side of the body and
30 years later my own experience shows that speakers have trouble counting
within this traditional system once they have done the left hand and started
moving up the left arm.
     The reason why the Mian system escaped Healey’s attention probably lies
in the fact that body-part numerals cannot be used as numerals in noun
phrases, which they can in Telefol. This might be because the Mian body-tally
system was never used as a general counting device, as for example in Telefol
(Healey 1964a, Healey 1965a), but rather was highly restricted to counting in
connection with specific cultural practices, for example keeping track of the
months that had to pass until a new taro garden would have to be cleared and
planted. Nowadays, the body-part counting system is basically defunct. In
table 3.17 I give all the forms I was able to record.

13.2.4.     Adverbial clauses with the article =oThese display clausal syntax, yet they are formally treated as noun phrases
because they always bear the article =o reflecting neuter 2 gender. Like
medial clauses, adverbial clauses can be topic-marked with =le as well. In the
following examples the adverbial clause appears enclosed in square brackets.
    The verbs in adverbial clauses are final verbs, i.e. they have their own
polarity value and can be inflected for irrealis. A temporal interpretation (24)
or a locative interpretation (25) is possible:(24)      [naka=i                   utl-Ø-ib=o]

          blood) rose and covered him’ [Afoksitgabáam]Adverbial clauses whose verb is inflected with -Vm ‘Conditional’ have a
conditional interpretation, for example:(26)      [n      alél-sa      n-im-i=o]
          1SG      wife-with    stay.PFV-COND-1SG.SBJ=N2          sein-amab-i=be

          ‘If I eat pandanus, I’ll get diarrhoea.’
13.2.5.     Topicalized adverbial clausesAdverbial clauses with the article =o can be marked as topical with the topic
clitic =le to indicate that a whole event is relevant to what follows:(28)      [          utlaan          dama-Ø-ib=o=le]
          3PL.AN      come_up.PFV     grow_up-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=N2=TOP                    y     walo-n-ib=ta
          3PL.AN     there multiply-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
          ‘so when they grew up, they multiplied and then ...’ [Dimosson]In example (28), the topicality of the clause marked as the topic lies in the fact
that it is a necessary prerequisite for the event of the succeeding clause to take
place. Before humans can procreate they need to grow up.
                                                        13.2. Adverbial clauses   49713.2.6.     Adverbial clauses with the postpositions temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at
            the time when’Temwât ‘while’, which itself consists of the nominal postposition tem ‘in(to)’
(from the noun tem ‘inside’) and the directional wt ‘across’, can follow the
verb of an adverbial clause to specify that the event described by the
preceding clause is on-going at a certain point in time, at which another event
takes place so that both situations temporally overlap, at least partially. The
whole construction has to be marked as adverbial with the article =o.
Intonationally, temwât belongs to the adverbial clause. The characteristic
pause indicating the beginning of a new clause comes after, never before
temwât.(29)      [kbo      fút=e                gen-b-eb                    temwât=o]

          ‘While you are rolling a smoke, a gecko shat on it for you.’One also finds two alternative constructions to this. In (30) the article =o
appears both on the verb in the adverbial clause and temwât:(30)      [walo      te-b-ib=o                                 temwât=o]

          ‘while they were begetting many generations, a certain man took a
          wife, and then he…’ [Dimosson]In (31) there is a high-toned free pronoun between the verb in the adverbial
clause and temwât:(31)      [walo        te-b-ib                                  temwât=o]

       3SG.F_CL.O-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED=TOP
       ‘while they were begetting many generations, a certain man took a wife,
       and then he…’ [Elicited as a contrast to (30)]This seems to be the original construction in which the free pronoun
functioning as a resumptive pronoun anaphorically refers to the proposition of
the whole preceding clause. It is plausible that (29) and (30) represent
successive stages of phonological erosion of this pronoun. While it is realized
as a toneless clitic in (30), it has completely disappeared in (29).
   Dim ‘at the time when’, which is basically a nominal postposition meaning
‘on(to)’ (from the noun dim ‘top’), can follow the verb of an adverbial clause
to specify that at a certain time while one situation holds true (e.g. a state), a
new situation comes in. Like adverbials with temwât ‘while’, the whole
construction has to be marked as an adverbial by =o. Intonationally, dim
belongs to the adverbial clause. The characteristic pause indicating the
beginning of a new clause comes after, never before dim.
   Dim shows those same three constructional variants, described above for
temwât. In (32), the variant with the free pronoun is illustrated here:(32)   [sinanggwâno       naka=i=a                unáng=a=i

whereupon Dimosson set out from her mythical home of Dimobib in the New
Guinea Highlands towards Mianmin where she created the first man and
woman.
   Example (33) illustrates the constructional alternative, in which there is
neither a pronoun nor a clitic article:(33)      [n   áa      un-aamab-i                          dim=o]

          ‘At the time when I wanted to go to bed, I’ve smoked a cigarette.’
13.2.7.    The semantic difference between temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at the
           time when’The semantic difference between adverbial clauses with temwât and dim is
subtle. While both indicate that two events overlap, the former is preferred, if
one wants to express that one event occurs inside another one and that there is
some interaction between participants or interference between the events. The
latter only indicates a temporal overlap. Compare the following two examples:(34)      [         miting          ke-b-ib=o                     temwât=o]

          ‘While they are having a meeting, I’m smoking.’ (i.e. inside that
          meeting, possibly annoying participants and disrupting proceedings)(35)      [        miting          ke-b-ib=o                    dim=o]

          1SG        tobacco=SG.N1      cook-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘At the same time as they are having a meeting, I’m smoking.’ (i.e.
          outside the building, in my own house, etc.).’
500       13. Embedding13.3.       Relative clausesRelative clauses in Mian serve the function that many scholars have identified
for relative clauses in all languages, namely to delimit the potential reference
of a noun (e.g. Comrie 1981: 136). More specifically, a relative relation
involves two events (or states of affairs), a main and a dependent one, which
share exactly one participant. “[A] participant of the main SoA [State of
Affairs – SF] is identified within a set of possible referents by mentioning
some other SoA in which he or she takes part” (Cristofaro 2003: 195).
    Mian relative clauses are finite and can be either prenominal or head-
internal. There is no formal distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive
relative clauses. As the function of the latter ones is not to delimit potential
reference of a noun but rather to give additional information pertaining to the
referent in question, they are not covered by Comrie’s (1981) definition.
Nevertheless, this section also includes some examples of relative clauses
which are clearly of the non-restrictive type in English. In Mian the restrictive
vs. non-restrictive distinction is not formally expressed.","[521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526]"
"
10.1.      Polar questionsThe appropriate answer for a polar question is ‘yes’ or ‘no’, which are ae and
yeye in Mian, respectively. They are formed with the interrogative illo-
cutionary clitic =a. Very rarely, one finds polar questions with =e (which is
usually used for content questions). Like all illocutionary particles (see
386       10. Question formation3.13.1), =a encliticizes to the immediately preceding word and forms a single
prosodic word with it. A second type of polar question ends with bleka ‘or’.
   Intonationally, polar questions are characterized by a short intonational
peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is
formed by the illocutionary particle or the final syllable of bleka ‘or’.","[411, 412]"
"The assignment of dleb ‘sullen, irritable’, gaang ‘wise’ to the class of
adjectives is tentative because these two items are not well attested in the
corpus. Collocations like naka gaang ‘wise man’ and naka dleb ‘sullen man’
have head-modifier order and suggest that these two items are indeed
adjectives. Other concepts relating to human propensity, such as ‘hungry’,
‘angry’, ‘envious’, ‘happy’, ‘ashamed’ are expressed using (complex) verbs.
    Mian does not conform to the typological tendency noted by Dixon (2004:
4) that speed terms are in the adjective class if terms relating to physical
property are also in the adjective class. The two speed terms hebmamsâb ‘fast’
and fiab ‘slow’ are in the class of adverbs, whereas physical property terms
are adjectives.
    Suprasegmentally, adjectives – like nouns – are lexically specified for one
accent and one out of four tonal melodies (i.e. L, H, LH, and LHL). The HL
melody is unattested in adjectives. Adjectives function as modifiers of nouns
in noun phrases but can also be used as the only constituent of a headless noun
phrase and as the predicate in non-verbal clauses. As modifiers, adjectives
always follow the noun they modify with the notable exception of sin ‘old’
and memâ ‘new’, which can (and tend to) occur before the noun.
116    3. Word classes and grammatical relations   If a noun and an adjective occur in a head-modifier relation in a noun
phrase, both constituents can be followed by an article (or other adnominal
determiner) reflecting number and gender:(72)   tíl=e         sm=e
       dog=SG.M      big=SG.M
       ‘the big dog’Alternatively, – and this is more common in natural discourse – a single article
follows the rightmost constituent. Semantically, the utterances in (72) and (73)
are equivalent:(73)   tíl     sm=e
       dog     big=SG.M
       ‘the big dog’A small subset of adjectives, e.g. sm ‘big, loud, much’, gwáab ‘small, soft,
little’, ayam ‘good’, and misiam ‘bad’, but not ninik ‘dirty’ or teke(bmín)
‘long’, nor any of the colour adjectives, can be used adverbially to modify a
verb. Adjectives with adverbial function are not followed by an article and
occur immediately before the verb they modify. Two examples are given
below:(74)   mn       gwáab=o           sm me-b-o=be
       child     little=SG.F       big    cry.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL

       song=N2        good     sing.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She is singing a song/songs beautifully.’Example (75) contrasts with (76) below in that in the former ayam ‘good’ is
used as an adverb, whereas it is used as an attributive adjective in (76). As
such it appears with an article to indicate that it modifies the head noun ns
‘song(s)’:(76)   ns=o             ayam=o        ngaan-b-o=be
       song=N2           good=N2       sing.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She is singing (a) beautiful song(s).’Adverbial use is attested for the following adjectives: afan ‘wrong’, afet
‘different’, ayam ‘good’, ayók ‘secretly’, báin ‘true’, beselîb ‘huge, very
                                                             3.4. Adjectives   117loud’, dam ‘true’, gaang ‘wise’, gwáab ‘small, soft’, kat ‘flat’, keim ‘in the
open’, kweital ‘correct’, meleng ‘pleasant’, mikík ‘new, firstly’, misiam ‘bad’,
moton ‘true’, mubiang ‘last’, sm ‘big, loud’.
    A sizable subset of adjectives can be used as a secondary predicate in a
clause. Secondary predicates look like adjectives with adverbial function, i.e.
they occur before the verb without a determiner, but their function is not to
modify the event but to make a predication about an argument of the verb, as
in (77):(77)   naka=e      n=e            molot       klâ-n-e=be
       man=SG.M arrow=SG.N1 straight fix-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man fashioned the arrow straight.’Secondary predication is common with verbs of perception to express an
inherent property of the source (78) or the attitude of the experiencer towards
the source (79):(78)   le                     gliglî

    Common nouns and adjectives are formally very similar. Both categories
are without any inflectional morphology. Like nouns, adjectives can function
as the predicate in non-verbal clauses and can have verbs derived from them
with the inchoative derivational suffix -an, expressing the inception of the
state or property denoted by the adjective.
    Most adjectives do not reduplicate productively. There are a few
lexicalized adjective reduplications, such as kengkeng ‘tiny’, ningning
‘thorny’, gliglî ‘rough’, and dangdang ‘thin’. The adjectives sm, in the sense
of ‘great’ (not dimensional “bigness”) and afet ‘different’ can be used in
reduplicated form to emphasize plurality or variety (see 6.3.4).
    Adjectives can appear on their own as headless adjectives in noun phrases
without an overt nominal head. Compare (80) with an adjectival modifier and
(81) with a headless adjective:(80)   tíl=e         sm=e          a-têm’-Ø-al=e!
       dog=SG.M      big=SG.M       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT
       ‘Look at the big dog!’(81)   sm=e         a-têm’-Ø-al=e!
       big=SG.M      3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT
       ‘Look at the big (one)!’Examples like (81) could be taken as evidence to claim that Mian lumps
adjectives and nouns together in a single word class. However, we need to set
up a class of adjectives distinct from nouns for two reasons.
    First, there is a clear syntactic ordering principle between noun head and
adjectival modifier within the noun phrase. Besides the exceptions sin and
memâ noted above, all adjectival modifiers must follow the noun. Thus, one
finds: tíl=e sm=e and tíl sm=e ‘a/the big dog’ but not *sm=e tíl=e or *sm
tíl=e, neither with the same intended meaning nor any other meaning.
    Second, and more importantly, nouns are lexically specified for one
gender. The only exceptions are a few nouns which commonly undergo cross-
classification, i.e. pick their gender according to the sex of the referent (see
4.3). Adjectives, on the other hand, are not specified for gender. Although
adjectival modifiers do not have any inflectional markers which agree in
gender with the noun, any article or other determiner following the adjective
always does. In case of a headless adjective, as in (81) above, agreement
patterns in the determiner follow the gender of the noun normally used to refer
to a given referent.

possible to express a superlative meaning with the intensifier dót ‘very’:(82)   le                  bib        lo                   dót      teke=be

       ‘He is the tallest (man) in this village’ (lit. ‘This (one) is very tall in
       this village’)Comparisons can be expressed with adjectival antonyms, as in (83), or,
alternatively, in a two-clause structure involving the verb gai- ‘(by)pass,
surpass, outdo’, as in (84):(83)   Mosbi      =le         sm      eka    Banimo       -ta

       a_lot     go_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He is taller than me.’ (lit. ‘He surpasses me, he goes up a lot)There is a bipartite modifier ADJ1 tab ADJ2 tab ‘in between ADJ1 and ADJ2’
(lit. ‘ADJ1 down ADJ2 down’), which is generally used with antonyms. It
locates a property roughly in equal distance from the scalar poles established
by the antonyms ADJ1 and ADJ2, e.g.:(85)   ayam tab misiam tab        ‘soso, between good and bad’
       kining tab gliglî tab      ‘between smooth and rough’Mian has a substantial colour vocabulary. Colour words show the same
syntactic and morphological behaviour as adjectives. They follow the noun
they modify, can take an article, which agrees in number and gender with the
noun, and they appear as headless adjectives.
    The colour word inventory is substantial and Tok Pisin loan colour words,
such as blekpela ‘black’, blupela ‘blue’, and retpela ‘red’, are rarely used. The
full inventory consists of:
120    3. Word classes and grammatical relations(86)   namâ            ‘bright, white’ (cf. wan namâ ‘cockatoo’)
       milil           ‘dark, black’ (cf. mililanobe ‘it has become dark’)
       ilem            ‘red; blood’

       mt             ‘dark(er) green; bile’
       kb             ‘brown (ash)’Three colour words have variants: ilemein (analogous to ngáamein ‘yellow’)
‘red’, which – in contrast to ilem – can only be a colour adjective and not refer
to ‘blood’, mok ‘blue’ and moklim ‘blue’, and kosnal ‘orange’.
    There are two colour modifiers which are only used with colour adjectives.
They always follow the colour adjective:(87)   sibsib      ‘off-COLOUR TERM’, e.g. namâ sibsib ‘off-white’
       tlaal       ‘dark’, e.g. mokim tlaal ‘dark blue’Two adjectives are also used to modify colour adjectives. They always follow
the colour adjective:(88)   eing        ‘thick, spacious; luscious’; e.g. itanasít eing ‘luscious green’
       moton       ‘true, real’, e.g. ilem moton ‘real red’The adjectival modifier ADJ1 tab ADJ2 tab ‘between ADJ1 and ADJ2’ can be
used with colour adjectives, e.g.:(89)   kosmale     tab     ilem    tab
       orange      down    red     down
       ‘between orange and red’ [Language of Perception, (Majid and

of different taro species. These were elicited with the help of the MPI colour

These are omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. Nouns modified in such a
way cannot be possessed. An example is given below:(91)   omômom           wan=i            baa-Ø-ib=a
       all_kinds_of     bird=PL.AN       say.PFV-DS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘All kinds of birds talked and then someone else …’ [Crows]These might look similar to adjectives given the fact that the adjectives sin
‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ can actually appear prenominally but they need to be
separated from adjectives because they can never follow the noun while the
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ can also follow the noun like any other
adjective. Furthermore, omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’ cannot be
intensified while this is generally possible for adjectives.","[141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"

                                       3.11. Conjunctions and subordinators   1493.11.      Conjunctions and subordinatorsThe inventory of conjunctions and subordinators is rather small. Being a
clause-chaining language with morphologically rich medial verbs, Mian
mainly relies on the marking of sequentiality or simultaneity in medial verbs
to indicate temporal semantic relations between clauses for which English
uses conjunctions like then, after, when, as, while, etc. Adverbial clauses
without overt subordinators can have a range of semantic relations (namely
temporal, locative, or conditional) to their matrix clause. On adverbial clauses,
see 13.2. On the use of the postpositions temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at the time
when’, as conjunctions in embedded adverbial clauses, see 13.2.6.
   The word class of conjunctions and subordinators comprises:(168) eka                ‘and’
      =a                 ‘and’ (< eka)
      bleka              ‘or’
      otâne              ‘but’
      kesoa              ‘because, since’
      bita               ‘until’
      mole               ‘if’Mian is a typical verb-final language since subordinators (kesoa ‘because’,
bita ‘until’, mole ‘if’) occur in clause-final position (Dryer 2007: 100). Co-
ordinating conjunctions (eka and =a ‘and’, bleka ‘or’, otâne ‘but’) are
prosodically a part of the first conjunct.
3.11.1.    eka ‘and’The conjunction eka ‘and’ is strictly coordinating, i.e. it can only be used if
two expressions are of the same syntactic order, e.g. both are noun phrases
(169), adjectival modifiers (170), or clauses (171):(169) Memin        i=e           eka Daning i=e                eka
          PN       father=SG.M    and PN          father=SG.M and

      soap=SG.N1        yellow       and      soft=PRD=DECL
      ‘The soap is yellow and soft.’

          ‘she stayed and then came back and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]In (171), eka is redundant and binoa imin tenoa is also possible. I assume that
the medial verb clitic =a is derived from the coordinating clitic =a ‘and’,
which in turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’. The coordinating clitic =a
‘and’ is used to coordinate noun phrases (see 6.7 for examples).
3.11.2.     bleka ‘or’The conjunction bleka ‘or’ is used to coordinate maximally two noun phrases,
as in (172), or clauses (173). In the latter case, the verb of the first clause
appears without an illocutionary clitic:(172) kbo           éil    -ta               bleka   aning    -ta

          ‘Are you going to stay in the village or go to the garden today?’Coordination of three or more alternatives is unattested. On bleka ‘or’ in polar
questions, see section 10.1.2.
3.11.3.     otâne ‘but’The conjunction otâne ‘but’ coordinates two clauses. The verb in the first
clause has final verb morphology, i.e. it can be inflected for irrealis and
deontic mood but appears without an illocutionary marker (174):

          (Smith and Weston 1974b: 131)
3.11.4.     kesoa ‘because, since’The causal conjunction kesoa ‘because, since’ invariably occurs after the verb
and intonationally belongs to this clause, which gives the reason. The
consequence is given in the succeeding clause, which forms its own
intonational unit:(175) [milimsîn=e                 háang-an-Ø-e                      kesoa] IU
      other_side=SG.N1            dry-VBLZ-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ          because          [tob-ski-n-amab-i=be] IU

          ‘Because the other side has dried, I’ll turn it (the tobacco leaf)
          around.’ [Rolling smokes]The conjunction kesoa is probably derived from a verb that constituted its own
medial clause in a clause chain. Verbal morphology including S/R marking
with -s ‘DS.SEQ’, and medial verb marking with the clitic =a is still clearly
discernible. The most likely candidate for the verb stem is the function verb ke
‘do’, thus ke-s-o=a [do-DS.SEQ-EXPL=MED]. Intonationally, however, kesoa
does not constitute its own clause anymore and the verb preceding kesoa
allows final verb morphology, i.e. inflection for polarity, mood, and
inchoative aspect (176) are permitted:(176) me-m-e                      kesoa
      cry.IPFV-INCH-3SG.M.SBJ     because
      ‘because he was crying’ [Crows]On the other hand, kesoa retains some features of an erstwhile medial clause.
Apart from the medial verb marker =a, =ta is also possible (kesota). As the
152       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsexact semantic difference between these two variants is unclear at this stage I
gloss them both as ‘because’.
3.11.5.     bita ‘until’The temporal conjunction bita ‘until’ expresses that the event described in the
preceding clause continues up to the onset of the event in the succeeding
clause:(177) deib=o            on        bl-Ø-ib                         bita
      road=N2           go.PFV    stay.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ     until          bita       wàt-n-ib=ta
          until      across-SS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
          ‘they went and stayed (where they had gone to) until they went
          across (i.e. to Telefomin), and then they …’ [Mianmin and
          Telefomin]The conjunction bita ‘until’ very likely goes back to a shortened medial verb
form consisting of the existential verb bi and the medial clitic =ta. On such
shortened medial verb forms, see 11.2.13.
3.11.6.     mole ‘if’The conjunction mole ‘if’ is used in conditionals. An example is provided in
(178). For details on conditionals, see section 13.2.1.(178) y                      went-Ø-ib                         mole

sensations in a direct and vivid way (Dingemanse 2009). Ideophones are very
often phonologically peculiar. In Mian, they are phonologically marked in that
they often involve full reduplication, e.g. bangbang ‘clap’, bokbok ‘bubble’ or
partial reduplication, e.g. blele ‘fly’, fluluk ‘flutter (of a small bird)’.
Reduplication with ablaut is also attested, e.g. dingdung ‘hollow,
reverberating sound’, nikitneket ‘creak’, and fliliflala ‘blaze’. None of these
phonological characteristics are typical of any other word class. Semantically,
most ideophones refer to types of sound or types of movement. The corpus
contains roughly 60 ideophones (not counting linguistic renderings of animal
cries).
    Ideophones always immediately precede the main verb. They are further
subdivided into four classes depending on which type of verb they precede:   (i)      function verb ge/ga ‘say’
   (ii)     function verb ge/ga ‘say’ or existential verb n/bi~bl
   (ii)     motion verb, e.g. un~on/unê ‘go’, tl-~te/tle ‘come’
   (iv)     function verb ge/ga ‘say’ or motion verbIdeophones that refer to types of motion are adverb-like because they express
the manner of movement. In contrast to adverbs proper, ideophones are
syntactically fixed in front of the verb associated with them. Compare:(179) Milsen=e      blublu      un-Ø-e=be
      PN=M.SG       run         go.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘Milsen ran.’(180) *blublu Milsene unebeMany adverbs, on the other hand, are more mobile within the clause. Although
they tend to immediately precede the verb, as in (181), other positions are
possible, barring the position after the verb, as shown in (182):(181) n      imen=e           hebmamsâb       wen-b-i=be
      1SG     taro=SG.N1       quickly         eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL

      (*hebmamsâb) ‘I’m eating a taro quickly.’
154       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsIdeophones form fixed expressions with their associated verbs and do not
occur on their own, with the exception of bird cries. Thus, bangbang just
represents a clapping sound. Verbal nouns have to be used to refer to instances
of clapping or the activity of clapping:(183) bangbang       ge-nam-in
      clap           say.PFV-PFV-VN

11.2.2.     Medial versus final verbsMany Papuan languages that have clause chaining and S/R systems display a
difference in morphological complexity of medial verbs compared to
sentence-final verbs, which appear as the predicate of the last clause in a
clause chain. Compared to final verbs, medial verbs are commonly
morphologically impoverished. See Roberts (1997) for a typological survey of
S/R systems in New Guinea languages.
    In the simplest case, medial verbs are only marked for co-reference of
subject, not for tense or person/number of the subject. The following example
from Usan (Numugenan family, Madang Province) (Reesink 1987) is found in
Reesink (1983: 217 and pers. comm.):(36)      ye      nam     su-ab      is-omei
          I       tree    cut-SS     go_down-1SG.FAR.PAST
          ‘I cut the tree and (I) went down.’Often the marker has additional temporal meaning, ‘portmanteau-ed’ into the
same formative, e.g. sequential or simultaneous. This is the case in Fasu (West
Kutubuan family, Southern Highlands Province) (Loeweke and May 1980)
and Kalam (Kalam family, Madang Province) (Pawley 1966, Pawley 1987,
Pawley 1993). The following example is from Kalam (Pawley 1993: 101):(37)      kwt     d-y                  nwp pk-p-yn
          stick   hold-SS.PRIOR        him hit-PFV-2SG
          ‘You hit him with a stick.’ (lit. ‘You took a stick and hit him.’)
                          11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining   423The DS-forms of medial verbs are usually more complex. They can carry a
subject marker, which indicates DS while the SS form is zero, e.g. in Fore
(Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Scott 1978), or they can have an
anticipatory subject marker which indicates person and number of the
following subject, as in Hua (Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Haiman
1980: 187-189).
    In other languages, one finds portmanteaux DS markers, for example in
Kobon (Davies 1981) and Usan, where the DS marker also contains
information on subject person and number without this being segmentable as a
distinct morpheme. The following Usan example is from Reesink (1983: 218
and pers. comm.):(38)   ye      nam      su-ine         is-orei
       I       tree     cut-1SG.DS     go_down-3SG.FAR.PAST
       ‘I cut the tree (and it went) down.’Medial verbs can have separate suffixes for disjoint reference and for subject
person and number, as for example in Kalam (Pawley 1993: 94):(39)   an     ag-e-k                   g-a-k?
       who    say-DS.PRIOR-3SG         do-3SG-PST
       ‘Who told him to do it?’ (lit. ‘Who said and he did it?’)So in these typical examples of S/R in Papuan languages we find a situation
where medial verbs are different from final verbs in that not all medial verbs
are marked for subject person and/or subject number (e.g. SS medial verbs
often occur without an affix cross-referencing the subject), they often cannot
be marked for various categories, such as irrealis mood or absolute tense, i.e. a
tense category which has the moment of speaking as its deictic centre (Comrie
1985), and the formatives that medial and final verbs allow are formally and
functionally distinct.
   In Mian we find a less grammaticalized S/R system, characteristic of
languages of the West Papuan Highlands, e.g. Dani (Bromley 1981) and
Kapauku (Ekagi) (William Foley, pers. comm.). Mian also makes frequent use
of clause chaining in discourse, but here the situation is different in that
medial verbs resemble final verbs much more than in the languages above.
Mian medial verbs:-   convey aspectual information through the aspectual stem
    distinction unless the verb is trans-aspectual.
-   are always marked for subject and any additional argument(s) in
    the same way as if the verb occurred in an independent sentence.
424       11. Chaining constructions-     take a range of markers in their pre-subject suffix slot which
      convey temporal and S/R information. These are homophonous
      with a subset of those found in the pre-subject slot in final verbs
      (see 8.6.1 and 11.2.6.2).
-     can be marked for the tense categories ‘General past’ and
      ‘Hesternal past’ to locate an event in the (general) past or
      yesterday, respectively.
-     are directly inflected or serialized with an auxiliary stem of the
      existential verb. Medial verbs can occur with a proper subset of the
      auxiliary stems found in final verbs.","[448, 449, 450]"

disalignment of -Ø as aspect and S/R markers, see below) and they are subject
to the same co-occurrence restrictions with respect to verb stem aspect.
    The function of the TAM markers in final verbs is illustrated with one
example each. For details on TAM categories in final verbs, see 8.6.
446    11. Chaining constructions   The suffix -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ has a default temporal interpretation of
‘Immediate past’, but one finds verb forms marked in this way interspersed in
discourse about various stages of the past:(81)   ilem=e             te=ta

       ‘(Some) blood comes and does (this) to me.’ [Afoksitgabáam]The suffix -s ‘Remote past’ locates events in the remote past. It is mainly
found in myths and stories about the past or in actual historical accounts.(82)   yle    éil=e          a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
       well    pig=SG.M 3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
       ‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [History of Mianmin and Telefomin]The suffix -b ‘Imperfective’ has a default temporal interpretation of ‘present’
but can also be used for events in the past, as in (83):(83)   met         te               yomin      am=o

       build.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They came upriver and were building the initiation house.’
       [Initiation rituals]S/R markers having their origin in the TAM morphology of the language does
not seem to be a common development in New Guinea languages. Existing
theories of the origin of S/R markers in Papuan languages trace them back
either to gapping under identity, which gives rise to zero marking for SS
(Haiman 1983), or to a pronominal or deictic origin. For a condensed
summary of these theories of origin and an evaluation of their plausibility, see
Roberts (1997: 190-192). In general, homophony between aspect and S/R
markers does not seem to be well attested typologically, but see Jacobsen
(1983: 174-177) on some formal similarities of S/R and aspectual morphology
in North American languages.
    Yet, the formal parallels between the Mian TAM markers in final verbs
and S/R markers in medial verbs are too striking to be coincidence and the
                           11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining   447semantics of the former make them very likely candidates for the forms from
which the latter have been derived.
    The S/R marker -n originates in the homophonous realis mood marker. So
what it does is simply marking the ‘real’ status (Foley and Van Valin 1984) of
an event. As a marker in medial verbs, -n remains noncommittal with respect
to conjoint or disjoint subject reference in the verb of the reference clause with
the added complication that -n does function as a fully developed S/R marker
if the subject is first person singular.
    In medial verbs, the suffix -b means ‘DS.SIM’ and in final verbs -b means
‘Imperfective’. Apart from the homophony there is also a semantic
connection. In final verbs, marking for imperfective aspect by -b indicates that
the action is on-going at the moment of speaking. In medial verbs, -b indicates
that an action is on-going when the next takes place, in other words, that the
two actions are overlapping and at least partially simultaneous. Looking at it
from the other end, an action or event which is marked as simultaneous with
the one described in the following clause is very likely to be temporally
extended (barring the case where two punctual actions occur simultaneously,
as in “(Right) as the clock struck one, the bullet hit him”).5 Hence, there is a
strong association between imperfective aspect and simultaneity of events.
    Longacre (1983) argues for a two-fold ‘naturalness assumption’ in S/R
languages. By this he means an association between SS marking and
sequentiality, on the one hand, and DS marking and simultaneity, on the other.
It is the case that “[…] we can normally expect that actions in succession are
performed by the same person, while actions that overlap are performed by
different people” (p. 183).
    If we follow Longacre and assume that actions which occur simultaneously
are expected to be performed by different individuals, it is not surprising that
the marker -b acquired DS as an additional meaning in medial verbs.
    The suffix -n, on the other hand, which goes back to the homophonous
realis marker, generally only signals sequentiality of events but if it indicates a
S/R-related meaning, namely with first person singular subjects, it will always
be SS. Hence, even -n goes the way predicted by the naturalness assumption.
    The marker -s ‘DS.SEQ’ is derived from a deictic tense category, namely
‘Remote past’, the temporal meaning would of course be sequential. Two
points are noteworthy here.
    First, -s has acquired a further meaning apart from DS. It is used to express
sequentiality, DS, and a close temporal or causal relation between events. This
is in contrast to -Ø ‘DS.SEQ’, which does not have this additional meaning.
    Second, it might seem counterintuitive that a S/R marker meaning ‘DS.SEQ’
should be derived from the remote past tense suffix. After all, ‘Remote past’ is
not part of the meaning -s has in medial verbs. However, only TAM suffix
occurring in final verbs that is not also used in medial verbs is
448       11. Chaining constructions-b(H) ‘Non-Hodiernal past’, which is (at least segmentally) homophonous with
-b ‘Imperfective’ in final verbs and ‘DS.SIM’ in medial verbs. Hence, if one
assumes that the language filled out its S/R paradigm by deriving forms from
the TAM suffixes used in final verbs, it seems that choosing -s was a
reasonable option for the language.
    Finally, we have to account for the most problematic case, namely -Ø
‘DS.SEQ’. Like -n ‘(SS.)SEQ’, it always indicates event sequentiality, which is
not surprising given their common origin is the realis marker -n ~ -Ø. Unlike
-n ‘(SS.)SEQ’, however, it forces the reference clause subject to be disjoint in
reference. The semantic dissociation between the S/R markers -n and -Ø needs
an explanation because as mood markers in final verbs they are allomorphs,
both with the meaning ‘Realis’. However, the semantic dissociation in the S/R
forms is only partial. A substantial, and I would argue crucial, portion of the
meaning remains constant. Both -n and -Ø still signal sequentiality which is
associated with the ‘Realis meaning’ of the original mood marker. The
dissociation only began when the additional meaning of SS or DS filtered into
the aspect system of medial verbs. It seems quite natural that the language
would have chosen one of these two to also indicate SS and the other to also
indicate DS apart from their basic temporal meaning of sequentiality, once a
SS/DS contrast had developed elsewhere in the system.","[471, 472, 473, 474]"
"
Notes to Chapter 11 1.   The evidence for first person plural subjects remains inconclusive. As first
      person plural forms are only sparsely attested in the spontaneous data corpus, I
      tested the behaviour of verbs inflected with -n with first person plural subjects
      in elicitation. A co-referent subject in the reference clause was always accepted
      but speaker judgments were inconsistent when reference was disjoint. What’s
      more, examples which had been accepted earlier were rejected later.

 3.   Stirling (1993: 50) argues that the systems in Gokana and Kaingáng are in fact
      logophoric and that Eskimo has an obviation system.
 4.   In my analysis of the Mian gender system, I treat genders as singular-plural
      pairs defined by sets of affixes. Both masculine and neuter 1 gender have -e as
      the subject marker. If the subject of the marked clause is masculine and the
      subject of the reference clause is neuter1 both verbs will have -e in the subject
      slot (see chapter 4).
 5.   This sentence would sound at least odd if either of the clauses had a verb in the

        While the bullet was hitting him, the clock struck one. Both of these sentences
      might be used to describe slow motion footage of the event of a bullet hitting
      somebody at exactly one o’clock but under normal circumstances they sound
      odd.

      fillers which is unattested in final verbs in a clause chaining construction. -Nab
      only occurs in medial verbs where it indicates DS and event sequentiality with
      a short interval between marked and reference clause events. It also occurs in
      simple independent sentences with the meaning ‘Near past’.
 2.   This is possibly due to (accidental) homophony between =a ‘medial’ and =a
      ‘polar question’.","[608, 609]"
"
11.2.7.     Tense marking in medial verbsMedial verbs including the existential verb can be inflected with either -bio
‘General past’ or -so ‘Hesternal past’ (plus the special suffix -nom). I describe
these two types of medial verb in detail in the two following sections. Before
that, however, it is necessary to alert the reader to an important difference
between such verbs and medial verbs without either -bio or -so-nom.
    As I discussed above, medial verbs have their pre-subject slot filled by a
suffix which signals information relevant to the S/R system of the language
(SS vs. DS) and to the temporal structure of the event (SEQ vs. SIM). Tense
marked medial verbs are different in that the range of suffixes in their pre-
subject slot is highly restricted. Non-habitual medial verbs inflected with -so
always have -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ in their pre-subject slot, never -s or -b. Non-
habitual medial verbs inflected with -bio either have -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’ or -b
‘Imperfective’ in their pre-subject slot, never -s. Habitual medial verbs
inflected with -bio always have -b ‘Imperfective’ in their pre-subject slot,
never -s or -n ~ -Ø. It seems that the suffixes -n ~ -Ø and -b are interpreted as
in final verbs, namely as ‘Realis’ and ‘Imperfective’, respectively, and that
S/R-related meaning does not come into play. This analysis can be supported
by the following examples.
                          11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining    449(84)   n       unín=o       fu-n-i-bio=ta
       1SG      food=N2      cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=MED       tl-Ø-i=be
       come.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘After I had cooked food, I came.’(85)   n       unín=o      fu-Ø-i-bio=ta
       1SG      food=N2     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=MED       tl-Ø-i=be
       come.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘After I had cooked food, I came.’Both (84) and (85) are grammatical and mean – as far as I can tell – the same.
If the suffixes -n and -Ø in these two sentences were really concerned with
indicating S/R, example (85) should not be possible. As the subject in the
reference clause is the same as the one in the marked clause, -Ø cannot be
interpreted as ‘DS.SEQ’.
    Furthermore, we find examples like:(86)   n       fút=e                fu-n-i-bio=ta
       1SG      tobacco=SG.N1        smoke-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=MED       kbmi=e        abuk ge-n-ebo=be
       yours=SG.N1 later roll.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I had smoked and later you rolled yours.’If -n in (86) behaved like a normal S/R suffix it would have to indicate same
subject and event sequentiality in the first person singular. Although a
different subject is following, inflection of the verb in the marked clause with
-n is allowed.
    Having established the behaviour of the suffixes in the pre-subject slot in
tense-inflected medial verbs, I would like to point out that I still analyse these
forms as medial and not as final verbs. The reasons for that are that they are
still overtly marked as medial with either =a or =ta and do not take
illocutionary particles, and that they obey the scope rules for medial verbs (see
chapter 12). Furthermore, medial verbs inflected with -so-nom differ from
final verbs inflected with -so in that the former need the special suffix -nom,
which does not appear in the latter. Medial verbs inflected with -bio differ
from final verbs inflected with -bio in that the former also allow -b
450       11. Chaining constructions‘Imperfective’ in the pre-subject slot, while in the latter the pre-subject slot
can only be filled by -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’.","[474, 475, 476]"

9.7.      Possessor raisingPossessor raising is a valency-increasing process through which a possessor is
promoted to object status. In Mian, possessors can be expressed by recipient
suffixes on -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ compounded with the main verb in the
perfective. In the imperfective affixation is directly to the stem.
   Possessor raising is commonly found with body parts, but not restricted to
these (see below). If the verb is transitive (after possessor raising), the body
part is indexed on the verb as the subject. Consider the following example of
sikà’ ‘swell (IPFV)’, repeated from (49) above:(68)    yle     kenéng
        well,    cheek        sikà’-ye-biaan-o=a
        swell.IPFV-PL.AN.R-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-3PL.N1.SBJ=MED
        ‘well, their cheeks were swelling up’ [Sofelok 2]Possessor raising is also attested with body wastes:(69)    al=o               méb
        faeces=PL.N1       close        tl-ûb’-a-s-o=ta
        come.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SEQ-3PL.N1.SBJ=MED
        ‘he had to defecate and then he …’ (lit. his faeces came
        close) [Danenok]If the verb is ditransitive (after possessor raising), the body part is the object,
as in (70). Recall that not all transitive verbs mark their object with a
pronominal or classificatory prefix:(70)    bnon=e
        arm_bone=SG.N1        hel-ût’-ne-n-e=be
        break_across.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He’s broken my arm.’
358    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseThere is a restriction that the pronominal affixes cross-referencing subject and
any object must not co-referent. In reflexive situations, the object marker on
the verb cannot reflexively refer to the endpoint of a reflexive action (see 9.9
on reflexivization). Likewise, raising of a possessor to object status is
impossible if the subject is identical to the possessor of the body part. Hence,
possessor raising is disallowed in (71):(71)   bnon=e             helâ-Ø-i-o=be
       arm_bone=SG.N1      break_across.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
       ‘I’ve broken my arm (intentionally or unintentionally).’Mian has extended the possibility for possessor raising from body parts to all
possessed items. Any animate possessor can be raised to argument status, as in
(72) and (73):(72)   nakamîn=e         imen=o           éil=e
       man=SG.M          taro=PL.N1       pig=SG.M       wen-ha-b-e=a
       eat.IPFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘While a pig was eating taro from a man (, the man…)’ [Pig story](73)   ul-ta                 kwéit
       who-3SG.M.EMPH         sugarcane       hal-ût’-ne-n-e-bu=e?
       break_off.PFV.SG.O-give.PFV-REAL-1SG.R-3SG.M.SBJ-GPST=CQ
       ‘Who broke off (some of) my sugarcane?’ [Unangkliten]The next example illustrates possessor raising with a transitive verb, which
obligatorily indexes its object with a pronominal prefix, e.g. -nâ’ ‘kill (PFV)’:(74)   n     tíl=o          wa-nâ’-ût’-ne-n-e
       1SG    dog=SG.F       3SG.F.O-kill.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ       naka=e       mo     tekein       ke-b-i=ba=be
       man=SG.M NEG knowledge do-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=NEG=DECL
       ‘I don’t know the man who killed my bitch.’Apart from the object suffix, the possessor can be encoded with an optional
possessive pronoun preceding the possessed, as in (75):
                                                    9.8. Impersonal verbs   359(75)   (n)                    wéng=o

        hear.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT
       ‘(You should) Mark my words!’
9.8.     Impersonal verbsA few verbs which signify the arrival of the morning, the evening or the night,
or express that some time has passed invariably have -o in the position of the
subject suffix. However, they can never occur with an overt subject noun
phrase which this -o would cross-reference. Therefore, I treat these verbs as
impersonal and analyse -o as an expletive subject marker. Impersonal verbs
have zero-valency. They cannot undergo derivation to increase their valency.
Semantically, they are zero-place predications, similar to expletive
constructions in Indo-European languages, such as English ‘it’s raining’. Two
examples are given below:(76)   bomâ-s-o=to                       yole    

       ‘They stayed and in the evening they went to sleep’
       (lit. ‘…when it darkened…’) [Pig story]
9.9.     ReflexivizationReflexivization is an infrequent phenomenon in Mian discourse. Therefore,
this section is more about what cannot be expressed reflexively than about
what can.
360    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause   The most common way of describing a reflexive situation is to replace the
object of a transitive verb with a reflexive pronoun. Compare (78) and (79):(78)   naka=e         aal=e               gò’-n-e=be
       man=SG.M       skin=SG.N1          cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has cut the skin.’(79)   naka=e        -maye              gò’-n-e=be
       man=SG.M      3SG.M-REFL          cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has cut himself.’Reflexivization works productively with some transitive verbs, namely only
those which denote a physical action towards the self. The pronoun in (80) can
only have an emphatic but not a reflexive reading:(80)   naka=e            -maye
       man=SG.M          3SG.M-REFL       kimâa’-bi-Ø-e=be
       care_for.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man himself is caring for (someone).’
       *‘The man is caring for himself.’Mian does not have any lexically reflexive verbs, for which the reflexive
reading would be entailed. All grooming verbs are transitive and require an
object which refers to the affected body part:(81)   naka=e            mináan=o
       man=SG.M          whisker=PL.N1       deilâ’-n-e=be
       remove_hair.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has removed his whiskers.’ (i.e. ‘the man has shaved’)The most frequent grooming verb (aaie) fuela/(aaie) fua ‘bathe’ is a noun-
verb idiom (see 8.10). It is interpreted as reflexive in its intransitive form, as
in (82):(82)   naka=e         aaie     fua-b-e=be
       man=SG.M       water bathe.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man is bathing (himself).’
                                                       9.9. Reflexivization   361A transitive verb (aaie) fuela-/(aaie) fua- ‘bathe somebody’ can be derived
from the intransitive base. However, a reflexive reading is never possible for
the derived form:(83)   kbo
       2SG.M       aaie     fuela-ˆt’-ne-n-al=e!
       water    bathe.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT
       ‘(You should) Bathe me!’Although many transitive verbs that obligatorily index their objects with a
pronominal or a classificatory prefix denote concrete physical actions, none
can actually be used reflexively by having co-referent subject and object
markers. This is simply not permitted by the grammar. For these verbs, e.g.
-têm’ ‘see (PFV)’, the object prefix must never be co-referent with the subject
suffix. Hence, (84) is fine, (85) can only have a disjoint reading and (86) is
ungrammatical and does not have any meaning:(84)   a-têm’-Ø-i=be
       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I saw him.’(85)   a-têm’-Ø-e=be
       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Hek saw himl.’
       BUT: *‘He saw himself.’(86)   *na-têm’-Ø-i=be
       1SG.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       Intended: ‘I saw myself.’Apart from this systematic grammatical restriction, there are semantic and also
cultural reasons which militate against reflexivization. Consider the transitive
verbs -fû’/— ‘grab’ and -nâ’/— ‘hit, kill’. While one can grab or hold other
people, it is less clear how one would grab oneself and self-hitting and suicide
are not part of Mianmin culture.
   However, to “see oneself” is both semantically plausible and culturally
appropriate. In former times the only surface which reflected properly was
water. Hence one used to say and in fact still says today:
362       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(87)      naka=e       aa-kikit=e                  doka-b-e=be
          man=SG.M water-reflection=SG.N1          behold-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
          ‘The man is looking at his (water-)reflection.’Although there are mirrors nowadays and the noun aakikit is actually used to
refer to mirrors, one still cannot “see oneself” in Mian. An alternative to (87)
is (88):(88)                kibi=o       wa-temê’-b-e=be
          3SG.M      face=N2      N2.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
          ‘He’s looking at his face (implied: in the mirror).’
9.10.       Constituent orderThis section deals with the order of constituents in the clause. There are no
differences in constituent order possibilities between medial clauses, on the
one hand, and final clauses or independent sentences, on the other. The only
clause type which can show an order of constituents not attested in any other
clause type is the head-internal relative clause (see 13.3.7).
    I will first describe the unmarked order of overtly realized argument noun
phrases (which is S/A followed by O) and then discuss deviations from it.
    Finally, the position of different types of adverbs and adverbial adjuncts in
the clause will be discussed.","[383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388]"
"
8.7.2.     Verbal nounsVerbal nouns are formed by affixing -in to the perfective or the imperfective
M-form, e.g. fu-nam-in ‘(instance of) cooking (PFV VN)’, fu-m-in ‘(activity of)
cooking (IPFV VN)’. The verbal noun is the citation form for all verbs. Verbal
nouns are inflected for aspect with -nam in the perfective and -m in the
imperfective. Furthermore, they require any object(s) of the verb to be indexed
by an affix on the stem, regardless of whether a given object is part of the
basic or the derived argument structure of a verb. Hence, it is not possible to
just say ‘kill’ in Mian, one has to include the object and say ‘kill him’, ‘kill
them’, etc.:
                                                     Non-finite verb forms   317(205) i-nâ’-nam-in / *nâ’-nam-in
      PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(instance of) killing us/you/them (PFV VN)’When there is no referent for the object provided by the context, for instance
when a verb is cited, speakers by default use the third person singular
masculine or the animate plural form of an object affix in the verbal noun. For
example, if asked out of context what ‘see’ means, Mian speakers will answer
either (206) or (207):(206) a-têm’-nam-in
      3SG.M.O-see.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(instance of) seeing him (PFV VN)’(207) ya-têm’-nam-in
      PL.AN.O-see.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(instance of) seeing them (PFV VN)’Verbal nouns have the syntactic distribution of nouns and can occur as
subjects and objects and as possessors of another noun phrase. As nouns, they
are of neuter 2 gender and can take the article =o when used as arguments.
    Semantically, the perfective and imperfective verbal nouns differ in the
following way: The former denotes exactly one bounded event, e.g. onamin
‘(instance of) going (PFV VN)’, whereas the latter denotes one or more
unbounded events, e.g. unêmin ‘(activity of) going (IPFV VN)’. The following
two examples illustrate this semantic difference in an elicited minimal
sentence pair:(208) on-nam-in=o              fatnà=ta
      go.PFV-PFV-VN =N2        do_what=MED       dê’-bl-Ø-ib=e?
       desist.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Why don’t you go?’(209) unê-m-in=o               fatnà=ta
      go.IPFV-IPFV-VN=N2       do_what=MED       dê’-bl-Ø-ib=e?
       desist.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Why aren’t you moving along (i.e. in a queue)?’
318    8. Verb morphologySmith and Weston (1974b: 65-66) call all verb forms in -in ‘customary’. This
meaning may be contained in the imperfective verbal noun, which can indeed
be used for recurring and habitual actions and events. In more general terms,
however, ‘customary’ is clearly a misnomer because imperfective verbal
nouns do not necessarily denote habitual or customary actions, e.g. unêmin
‘(activity of) going (IPFV VN)’ in (209) is simply continuous, nor do perfective
verbal nouns ever signify habitual actions.","[342, 343, 344]"
"
9.11.     Non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are topic-comment constructions consisting of a non-finite
predicate (the comment) and exactly one argument (the topic). The predicate
is followed by the predicator =o. The topic is non-obligatory and thus can be
left out if its identity is obvious or retrievable from the linguistic or extra-
linguistic context. Non-verbal predicates always are one-place predicates and
can consist of a pronoun or noun (including proper names and verbal nouns),
an adjective, or an adverb.
    Like clauses with finite verbs, non-verbal clauses are marked for
illocutionary force. The range of illocutionary markers, however, is slightly
more restricted since non-verbal predications cannot be hortatives. One finds
=be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =a
‘Question’ and =e ‘(Content) Question’. For interrogatory non-verbal
predications, see 10.1.1.
    An example of a declarative non-verbal predication is:(118) Iliba=e       tíl=o=be
      PN=SG.M       dog=PRD=DECL
      ‘Iliba is a dog.’Any noun phrase is permitted as the topic argument. This noun phrase can
consist of a free or inflected pronoun or a headless adjective. If the identity of
the referent of the topic noun phrase is obvious it is commonly left out:(119) tíl=o=be
      dog=PRD=DECL
      ‘It’s a dog.’The reader should note that the pronoun ‘it’ in the free translation is not meant
to be taken as referential. ‘It’ does not refer to any entity which happens to be
a dog. Nothing in the Mian utterance tíl=o=be actually refers to the entity
about which the predication is made.
   There is no predicator in questions:
372       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(120) tíl=a?
      dog=Q
      ‘Is it a dog?’If the predicate term ends in a vowel the predicator =o is usually left out, even
in non-interrogatory contexts. However, occasionally =o is put in even under
these circumstances. Compare more frequent (121) and less frequent (122)
with the same meaning:(121) naka=be
      man=DECL
      ‘It is a man.’(122) naka=o=be
      man=PRD=DECL
      ‘It is a man.’
9.11.1.     IdentityNon-verbal predications express more or less permanent states, as opposed to
temporary ones. They are commonly used to state the identity of some
referent:(123) n         Bikene=i      unáng=o=bo
      1SG        PN=PL.AN      woman=PRD=QUOT          ge        baa-s-o=a
          say.PFV say.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘ “I am a woman of the Bikene (people)” she said, and then someone
          else…’ [Dimosson]The following example (124) illustrates the reversed order of the topic and the
comment, see ungrammatical (125), if the predicate term is a proper name, kin
noun, or dyad (when the predication is about identity). In this case the topic
has to be an emphatic pronoun, compare grammatical (124) with
ungrammatical (126):(124) Kasening        n-ta=be
          PN          1SG-EMPH=DECL
          ‘I’m Kasening.’
                                                  9.11. Non-verbal clauses   373(125) *n    Kasening=o=be
      1SG    PN=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘I’m Kasening.’(126) *Kasening           n=be
          PN              1SG=DECL
          Intended: ‘I’m Kasening.’
9.11.2.    PropertyAnother common function of non-verbal predications is to predicate certain
properties of a referent:(127) ngáamein=o=be
      yellow=PRD=DECL
      ‘It is yellow.’(128) ninín     Sofelok lo          sino      awém=o=be
      name      PN       DEM.N2      before taboo=PRD=DECL
      ‘Before, this name Sofelok was taboo.’ [Sofelok, 2]In non-verbal predications which designate properties one also finds a variant
which involves =na ‘too’ which is possibly derived from the verb stem na
‘do’. The meaning is that the topic argument – apart from other potential
properties – also has the property predicated about it by the predicate term.
This construction can be used only with adjectives:(129) wan     le                      ilem=na=be
      bird    DEM.PROX.SG.M            red=too=DECL
      ‘This bird is also red (in addition to some other colour(s)).’(130) as=e             milil     eka teke=na=be
      tree=SG.N1       black     and long=too=DECL
      ‘The tree is black and also tall.’Although =na might have originated in the verb na, it cannot be inflected in
property predications. Therefore, I treat this construction as non-verbal.
374       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause9.11.3.     PossessionNon-verbal predications can be used to indicate possession. In non-verbal
possessive constructions, the predicate can be a possessive pronoun with
nominal function, e.g. nmi ‘mine’, kbmi ‘yours’ and nlemi ‘mine alone’,
kelebmî ‘yours alone’, etc., as in (131) with a topic term and in (132) without
one:(131) táang      le                         nmi=be
      flint      DEM.PROX.SG.N1              mine=DECL
      ‘This lighter is mine.’(132) nmi=be
      mine=DECL
      ‘It is mine.’An alternative way of expressing possession with a non-verbal clause is to

          ‘When did you come?’
10.2.7.     The interrogative word wanThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
   There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
   Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:

compounded with an emphatic pronoun, such as ta ‘he (EMPH)’ (see 3.7.4).
The interrogative clitic =e is used to mark interrogative illocution. When =e
follows the pronoun suffix -ta, this suffix is realized as -t, as in (46) and (47):(46)    bo    wan-bt=e?

subject. It is also possible to use wan to inquire about the object of a transitive
verb:

       ‘Who are you looking at?’In ditransitives, content questions about either the recipient (51) or the theme
(52) are possible, but not both in the same clause. The maximal number of
queried constituents is restricted to one:(51)   buk=o         wan-ta
       book=N2       who-SG.M.EMPH       om-ûb’-a-n-eb=e?

       PL.AN.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘What did you give to the man?’The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
   The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.(53)   kb              ninín=o=le       wan-kbt=e?

       ‘What is your (M) name?’ (lit. ‘As for your (M) name, who
       [are] you (M)?’)Like fàb ‘where’, the interrogative word wan plus an emphatic pronoun can
also be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier. In adnominal position it
means ‘which’:

intonational break):(55)   wan-ta                kàb         le

       ‘(As for) He who broke the cup, who (is he)?’ [TMA questionnaire,
       127]Compare constituent order in these two examples and also consider the order
in the possible declarative answer in (57), which is parallel in structure to
example (55):(57)   Milsen=e     kàb=e               klutâ-n-e=be
       PN=SG.M      cup(TP)=SG.N1       smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Milsen has smashed the cup.’Example (55) above consists of one clause showing the unmarked AOV order.
The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is
marked for interrogative illocution, whereas (56), on the other hand, does not
consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le
‘he who broke the cup’, which is marked as a topic with =le, followed by a
juxtaposed comment consisting of the interrogative word and the illocutionary

and two markers, -ka and -ta. Changing the value of one of the categories
causes the marker to change, whereas the marker remains the same if both
values are changed (Corbett 1991: 196). Such systems of full or genuine
polarity are comparatively scarce.
   Systems of ‘partial polarity’ are less rare and can, for example, be found in
Serbo-Croat. Table 4.8 illustrates agreement patterns of the predicate
agreement marker (Corbett 1991: 197).","[207, 208]"

6.6.     Dyadic termsDyadic terms are a subclass of the word class of nouns. They refer to a social
or a kin relationship between two or more people and encode relational
opposites (Evans 2003a, 2006). They can function as heads of noun phrases
which in turn are arguments of the predicate in the same clause. An example is
given in (69):
224    6. The noun phrase(69)   dab=i                                 y

       leave.PFV-give.PFV-N2.R-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=MED
       ‘after the brothers had left it (as it was), one of them…’ [Danenok]Most frequently, dyads occur with a plural possessive pronoun which refers to
the whole set of individuals described by the dyad. The possessive pronoun
has appositive meaning:(70)   b           mikim
       2PL.POSS     opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘you, brother and sister’The reason why I analyse the dyad as the noun phrase head with a possessive
pronoun in the possessor slot and not as a noun phrase apposed to a free
pronoun (an analysis suggested by the English translation I have chosen for
example (70) is because the pronoun forms are clearly from the possessive
pronoun series:(71)   *bo     mikimIn (71) the free personal pronoun cannot be used, cf. also nb mikim ‘we
(INCL), brother and sister’ and unacceptable *nbo mikim. I assume that the
possessive analysis is extended to the cases where the possessive pronoun is
homophonous with the free pronoun:(72)                   mikim
       3PL.AN.POSS      opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘they, brother and sister’ [MPI Reciprocals clip 1]Dyads can be preceded by a proper name or kin noun, which is in an
appositional relation with the dyad, forming an inclusory construction.
Reference is to the dyad of individuals, only one of which is explicitly named.
Examples are given below:(73)   Danenok   dab-wal

6.7.        Noun phrase coordinationMian has four strategies for the coordination of noun phrases:-      juxtaposition
-      coordination with =sa ‘too’
-      coordination by =a ‘and’
-      coordination by eka ‘and’All of these strategies are available for animate and inanimate nouns alike.
Coordination by juxtaposition shows a maximum of two coordinated noun
phrases in the corpus whereas there is no upper limit of coordinated noun
phrase for the other two strategies.
    The simplest strategy of noun phrase coordination is juxtaposition.
Coordination by juxtaposition is mainly used if the referents of the coordinate
noun phrases are relatively low in individuation. Examples (77) and (78)
illustrate this for animates and inanimates, respectively:(77)      naka homòn     unáng     homòn=i
          man many       woman     many=AN.PL
          ‘many men and many women’ [Sofelok, 2]
226    6. The noun phrase(78)   db=o          ket=o
       seed=N1.PL blossom=N1.PL
       ‘seeds and blossoms’ [Sofelok, 1]Coordination by juxtaposition is not available with noun phrases referring to
individuals or singular entities in subject or object position. However,
juxtaposition of proper names occurs in the possessor position:(79)   Fitibkanib=o Dimoson                        wengsâng=o
       PN=SG.F           PN          3PL.AN.POSS story=N2
       ‘the story of Fitibkanib and Dimosson’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Givón (1990: 497) notes that noun phrases which are conjoined by simple
juxtaposition often yield unified group lexical items. Wälchli (2005) calls
compounds whose component parts refer to stereotypically conjoined entities
additive co-compounds. Mian has a few such lexical items, e.g. alél-melel (lit.
wife-offspring) ‘(core) family’ and awók-aalok ‘adults, parents’, consisting of
awók ‘mother’ and a cranberry morph -aalok without any synchronically
establishable meaning. Although these were probably formed by juxtaposition
and at least partially have become semantically opaque, noun phrase
juxtaposition synchronically is a syntactic device forming coordinate noun
phrases without any tendency for lexicalization.
   The second coordination strategy involves the clitic noun phrase modifier
=sa ‘too’, which attaches to each coordinate noun phrase. Coordinate noun
phrases can refer to individuals (80) or to groups (81). The coordinated noun
phrases are bracketed:(80)   [Kasening     ]=sa         [Albet    ]=sa          y

                                            6.7. Noun phrase coordination   227The third coordination strategy uses the clitic =a ‘and’ (presumably a
shortened form of eka ‘and’), which cliticizes to each noun phrase in the
coordinate structure, as in (82) and (83) or just appears once on the rightmost
member of the coordination, as in (84). Note that the order of the article and
the coordinator on the last coordinated member is reversed. Reversal does not
take place if the last noun in the coordination ends in /a/, as in (83):(82)   naka=ya unáng=a=i
       man=and woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson](83)   tn=a        unáng=a      naka=i=a

       brother-PL=PL.AN     husband-PL=and=PL.AN
       ‘brothers and husbands’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]An example of an inanimate noun phrase coordinated with =a ‘and’ is
provided in (85):(85)   n=a         kakab=a       bobol=a=o
       liver=and lungs=and heart=and=PL.N1
       ‘liver, lungs, and heart’ [Crows]Instead of =a ‘and’ one also finds eka ‘and’ in noun phrase coordination. The
coordinated noun phrases appear in square brackets:(86)   [Memin    i=e]       eka [Daning       i=e]       eka
       PN        father=SG.M and PN            father=SG.M and

       SG.M=too
       ‘he himself and Bokolfet’s younger brother too’ [Mianmin and
       Telefomin]
228    6. The noun phraseThe conjunction eka ‘and’ is also used for the coordination of adjectival
modifiers within a single noun phrase. The first adjective in such a
coordination must not have a distributed article, as in example (88):(88)   sob=e           sm(*=e)          eka   tekebmín   le
       soap=SG.N1 big(*=SG.N1)           and   long       DEM.PROX.SG.N1
       ‘this big and long (bar of) soap’
6.8.     Noun phrase appositionIn my analysis of noun phrase apposition in Mian I follow Rijkhoff (2002),
who defines appositional modifiers as “all those elements which semantically
speaking serve the same purpose as their non-apposed […] counterparts, but
which from a syntactic point of view are not part of the […] phrase containing
the head noun. An obvious requirement of any apposed modifier phrase is co-
reference: it must refer to the same entity as the other member(s) in the
appositional construction” (p. 22).
   Appositive noun phrases always follow the noun phrase to which they are
apposed. Typical examples include apposition of a proper name, as in (89) and
(90), specification of a profession (91), and a reflexive pronoun with
contrastive function (92). In the following examples, the appositional
modifiers are separated by a comma.(89)   n           imak=e,             Nialiaaleb=e

       Telefomin]
6.9.     Noun phrase topicalizationTopic-marking in Mian is done with the topic clitic =le which attaches to
noun phrases, including free pronouns. I analyse =le as a clitic rather than an
affix because it not only attaches to pronouns but can mark topical adverbial
clauses and medial clauses in clause chains as well. Topical constituents with
=le are intonationally detached from the following clause.
    Topic marking with =le is incompatible with emphatic pronouns, which
are used for focus (see 6.10), e.g. *-ta=le [3SG.M-EMPH=TOP].
    Topic-only question are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is
mentioned. The speaker has a particular question in mind, and it must be
obvious from the context what the implied question is, such as I’m going. And

       ‘ “As for me, Dabein that’s me.” ’ [Dimosson]Subjects can be topicalized with =le, as in the following excerpts from an
account of traditional initiation, where the topic is given:
230    6. The noun phrase(97)   [...] ‘Adults would line the side of the path. Others (also adults)
       would lead the boys who are to be initiated, and they (i.e. the boys)

       ‘as for the ones on the side (i.e. the adults), they take drums and ...’
       [Initiation rituals]This bit of discourse contains two groups of adults, as opposed to the boys,
one group lining the path, the other leading the boys. The topic pronoun is
here used to establish the first group of adults as the topic of the new clause.
    Topics are typically given information but this is not necessarily the case,
as in the following example where an object is topicalized which has not been
previously mentioned in the discourse:(98)   memé          =le               ||        Sobining=e

       ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]Multiple topicalized constituents can often be found as discourse openers (de
Vries 2005). In the following example, the first topic yomin=o=le is a more
general topic of the whole narrative, set up here as a discourse frame by the
speaker:(99)   yomin=o=le              ||   yangpela=i=le                    ||

as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
   Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
   Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:(100)           Asuneb=e=mo        a-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be

pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:(102) kbo           éil    -ta             bleka        aning      -ta

       ‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
  Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):(103) Mosbi      =le             || sm    eka      Banimo       -ta

       small=PRD=DECL
       ‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.
Chapter 7
The postpositional phrase
7.0.     IntroductionPostpositional phrases are adverbial adjuncts which fulfil a variety of
functions, such as situating an event spatially or temporally, or specifying an
instrument involved in an action. Postpositional phrases in Mian are always
syntactically optional. They provide additional adverbial information but their
omission never renders a clause syntactically incomplete.
   Postpositions can be simple or complex. An example of a simple
postposition is (1). Simple postpositions typically encliticize if their
complement is bare, as in (2):(1)    naka    -ta             baka
       man     PL.AN-EMPH       with       hâa’-bi-Ø-ob=a

       ‘while she was curing (them, i.e. frogs) with a torch there,
       someone else ...’ [Crows]Complex postpositions either consist of two or three combined postpositions,
e.g. tabáab-tem-daak [beneath-in(to)-down] ‘down underneath’, as in (3), or
they are denominal derivations formed by suffixing -daa ‘at’ to a noun (see
3.1.5), as in (4):(3)    hàs=e              tabáab-tem-daak
       hat(TP)=SG.N1      beneath-in(to)-down
       ‘down underneath the hat’(4)    as=e              dáang-daa
       tree=SG.N1        back-at
       ‘at the back of the tree (i.e. the side hitting the ground first when
       the tree is felled)’
234    7. The postpositional phrase7.1.     Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directionalThese consist of one noun phrase without a determiner and one directional
postposition. The inventory of directionals comprises:(5)    ut          ‘up(wards)’
       daak        ‘down(wards)’
       met         ‘up(river)’
       tab         ‘down(river)’
       tm         ‘sideways, at the same level’
       wt         ‘across’For every postpositional phrase, there is an allative and a locative
interpretation:(6)    kim=daak              to-fâ-n-e=a

       ‘he grabbed (across) his wife’s hand’ [Flood]There are some structures which show that directionals when used as
postpositions do not follow nouns but noun phrases. In (9), the complement is
a noun phrase consisting of a possessor and a noun head. In (10), the
complement is a nominalisation unin ‘activitiy of ingesting’ with its object aa
‘water’:(9)    hen            tab                tem-Ø-e=a

                 7.1. Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directional   235       [kwin=i           bibam] NP tab=o

       ‘he was seeking (for his wife), he looked downriver, downriver at the
       ghost village’ [Ghost village](10)   [aa          un-in]               daak=o

       ‘down at the water drinking (place), a large tree broke down and then
       they …’ [Flood]The noun phrase serving as a complement of a directional never has an article
or any other adnominal determiner nor can it be followed by adjectival
modifiers:(11)   *Skiobib=o=tab
       PN=N2=downriver
       Intended: ‘downriver at/to Skiobib’The postpositional phrase can optionally be followed by an article. In this case
the postposition does not cliticize. The article can agree in gender and number
with the noun in the preceding complement. The following two examples
show that the article following the postposition agrees in gender and number
with kakam ‘buttocks, butt’ (gender: N1) and tibín ‘river head’ (gender: N2),
respectively:(12)   kakam            tab=e             […]     ge-n-e=a
       buttocks(N1) down=SG.N1            [...]   tie.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he tied (it) down at the buttocks’ [Selimin](13)   ut-n-ib=a                         Sek     tibín                   ut=o
       up-SS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED        PN      river_head(N2)          up=N2
       ‘they ascended, up to the head of the river Sek’ [Flood]Gender agreement of the article is mostly disregarded and =o is used
regardless of the gender of the noun, thus instead of kakam tab=e ‘down at the
buttocks’ in (12) one also finds kakam tab=o. The article =o also marks
temporal nouns (see 3.1.9) and adverbial clauses (see 13.2) and is a default
marker for all adverbial adjuncts.
236    7. The postpositional phrase    The phrases kakam tabe and Sek tibín uto in (12) and (13) might look like
noun phrases as far as their internal syntax is concerned because they end in
an article. But in simple postpositional phrases with a directional only the
article is allowed. Noun phrases allow the full range of adnominally used
pronouns (see 6.2.3).","[249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"

5.8.     Verbs with obligatory classificatory prefixBelow are listed the most frequent verbs which require a classificatory prefix.
In a few cases, the classificatory prefix is frozen in the singular form of the
residue class ob-, e.g. ase ob-tanà/ase ob-tunu ‘light with fire’ and aaie ob-dî
‘fetch water’. In the case of the perfective-only stem -kilêb ‘put handle of bag
around forehead so that the bag hangs down the bag (in order to carry the
bag)’ the prefix is frozen as go- from the bundle class.(25)   -â’/—                 ‘leave, let’

       -môu/—       ‘put on shoulder’ (pig or child)
       -silêb /—    ‘follow’
       -tamà/—      ‘pen in, imprison’
5.9.     Gender system vs. classification by prefixNominal categorization in Mian is complex due to the fact that two different
nominal classification systems, which show different formal and semantic
properties, exist next to and interact with each other.
   First, there is the category ‘gender’ with the masculine, feminine, neuter 1
and 2 subcategories. All pronominal affixes on the verb agree in person,
number and gender with the arguments they cross-reference. If the verb occurs
without overt noun phrase arguments, pronominal affixes agree anaphorically
with a previously mentioned overt noun phrase argument.
   These instances of agreement are predictable from the person, number and
gender of the nominal argument. In other words, pronominal affixes never
have any semantic impact on the noun or its noun phrase. Their function is to
indicate grammatical relations in the clause and to enable construal of any
overt arguments with their respective cross-referencing affix by showing
agreement.
   In addition, there are the categories (prefix classes) established by sets of
classificatory prefixes. There are four reasons why I consider this system of
classificatory prefixes to be different from the system of gender agreement.
   First, only some verbs with similar semantics of object manipulation or
handling participate in the system of classificatory prefixes, whereas
pronominal affixes can be found on all finite verbs.
196    5. Classificatory verb prefixes   Second, nominal classification by classificatory prefixes operates on an
absolutive basis, whereas the gender system does not.
   Third, formal means and semantic categorizations used by the two
classificatory systems are quite different (see below).
   Fourth, the system of classificatory prefixes has instances of ‘non-standard
agreement’, i.e. in certain contexts, choice of the prefix is not necessarily
predictable from formal features (e.g. gender) of a noun or semantic properties
(sex, shape) of its referent. Examples of this will be provided in 5.10 below.
Within the gender system, agreement patterns are always predictable from the
gender specification of a noun.
   Phonologically, classificatory prefixes are more complex than the
pronominal affixes which define the genders. First, almost all prefixes have
prefix variants conditioned by quite diverse phonological environments.
Second, two classificatory prefixes show vowel harmony with a following
vowel (see 2.7.1).
   Note also the differences in semantic split-up. In the gender system, the
main semantic distinctions are animacy and sex, establishing a masculine, a
feminine, and two neuter genders. The distinction between the neuter genders
is mainly a formal one between those nouns with a number contrast and those
without a number contrast, though one should recall that this is not exclusively
a formal distinction but also a semantic one since an overwhelming number of
N2-nouns, such as masses, locations, and abstract or intangible entities are
non-count nouns.
   In the system of classificatory prefixes, animacy/sex is also an important
categorization criterion but the M-class and the F-class contain many items
from the inanimate world. Moreover, shape (long object) and function
(bundle-like or covering object) are criteria for classification. The residue
class mainly contains inanimate nouns which are also of neuter 1 gender, but
not exclusively so (for example a few animates such as máab tóm ‘tortoise
species’) and the residue class is not co-extensive with this gender since many
neuter 1 nouns are classified as M-class, F-class, long, bundle, or covering by
the prefix system.
   To sum up, two nominal classification systems operate alongside each
other in Mian: (a) the gender system and (b) the system of classification
through classificatory verbal prefixes. The formal means employed by the
respective systems are clearly distinct and the semantic criteria for
classification yield two different ways of categorizing nouns.
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   1975.10.     ReclassificationReclassification refers to a different categorization of a noun due to the choice
of a different classificatory prefix in order, for example, to highlight a certain
feature of the referent. Reclassification in Mian mainly applies to nouns whose
referents are or can somehow be handled like bags, for instance bundles of
firewood or substantial chunks of pork which have a string or rope attached to
them. This characteristic of the referent is not expressed in the noun, but in the
classificatory prefix. An example of reclassification by using a different
classificatory prefix is given in (27) and (28):(27)    éil=o      om-fâ-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.F_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He put down the (piece of) pork.’(28)    éil=o     gol-meki-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the (piece of) pork (on a string).’In this case, the semantic impact of the classificatory prefixes of the bundle
class is hard to miss. The information that the referent of the object, namely
the meat, comes with a string or rope attached so that it can be carried around
or hung up like a bag or bundle does not reside in the noun itself, nor is it
included in the semantics of the verb stem. It might be argued that the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’ necessarily takes gol-/gulel- as a prefix because its
semantics suggest that in order to hang something up it must be bundle-like or
at least have a handle. However, sosbên, a Tok Pisin loan which refers to
metal pots of various sizes with handles, cannot occur with the bundle class
prefixes, even though the action of hanging them up can be referred to by
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’:(29)    sosbên=e     ob-meki-n-e=be / *gol-meki-n-e=be
        pot=SG.N1    3SG.RESID.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the pot.’Thus, the “hang-upability” of referents of objects of the verb -meki ‘hang up
(PFV)’ is more a selectional restriction of this verb rather than having anything
to do with the presence of the bundle class prefixes gol-/gulel-.
    In general the choice of a different prefix subtly changes the semantics of
an utterance. Compare:
198    5. Classificatory verb prefixes(30)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       dob-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (e.g. the whole bunch on a nail).’(31)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       gol-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (to which a string or rope is
       attached).’In (31), som=e ‘a/the banana bunch’ is reclassified as a bundle-like object.
Although the object is the same in (30) and (31), namely som=e in both cases,
the choice of prefixes indicates that in the former example the bunch of
bananas itself is hung over a hook or nail whereas in the latter example the
bunch has some string or rope attached to it, which is slipped over a hook or
nail.
   Example (31) can also have a different meaning, namely that the referent
of the object is a bag full of bananas. Bundle class prefixes can indicate that
the referent of the object is contained in a bag:(32)   tóm=e          gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=SG.N1    3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up a bag full of stones.’If several bags are involved, the difference in number is expressed on the
article and on the verbal prefix, but the fact that the objects are in a bag is
solely conveyed by the bundle class prefix:(33)   tóm=o           gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=PL.N1     PL.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I hung up bags full of stones.’The reclassification of a noun as bundle-like is not restricted to the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’. This can be seen in the following example:
                                                       5.10. Reclassification   199(34)   mn=e            y        gol-ò-n-e=a
       child=SG.M       there     3SG.BUNLDE.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘It (the wild boar) takes the boy (with the umbilical cord), and then…’
       [Afoksitgabáam]This sentence is from a story in which a pregnant woman is savaged by a wild
boar who tears her open, takes her unborn son, still attached to the umbilical
cord (the handle, so to say), and throws him on the ground. (The whole story
can be found in the text collection in appendix 1.)
   Reclassification of yóum ‘piece of clothing’, which is by default M-class
(35), to the covering class is exemplified in (36):(35)   yóum=e                         tek      dim=e
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        rope     on=SG.N1       do-fâ-n-ebo=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You put the piece of clothing on the line.’(36)   yóum=o
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        geme-tlâa’-n-ebo=be
        PL.COVER.O-remove.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You undressed (lit. ‘removed your clothes).’What the reclassification of ‘clothes’ effects in this case is the highlighting of
the fact that they had covered a person’s body before they were removed, as
stated in the utterance in (36) above.
    Another example of reclassification is provided in (37):(37)            tob-ò-n-e=a
       3SG.M 3SG.LONG.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he took it (i.e. his long penis) and then ...’ [Selimin]In this example, the classificatory prefix tob- refers anaphorically back to the
previously mentioned éit ‘penis’, which is assigned to the residue class by
default. However, in order to emphasize the enormous length of the
protagonist’s member, the speaker uses the prefix of the long class.
    All of these examples illustrate that reclassification can be used quite
creatively in Mian.
200       5. Classificatory verb prefixes5.10.1.     Plurals of inanimate nouns of neuter 1 genderThe noun éim ‘pandanus fruit’ is classified by default as belonging to the
M-class and occurs with the prefixes dob-/dol-. However, when one wants to
refer to considerable numbers of these fruits, the residue plural prefix ol- is
used. The same happens with long objects which are normally classified as
long and occur with tob-/tebel-. If their numbers exceed a few, the plural
prefix ol- of the residue class is employed:(38)      kbo       geim=o                  tebel-ubmà
          2SG.M      pronged_arrow=PL.N1     PL.LONG.O-turn_around          tebel-abmà         bi-Ø-ebo=be
          REDUP              exist.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘You are turning around (a few) pronged arrows in your hands.’(39)      kbo       geim=o                  ol-ubmà
          2SG.M      pronged arrow=PL.N1     PL.RESID.O-turn_around          olabmà     bi-Ø-ebo=be
          REDUP      exist.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘You are turning around (quite a few) pronged arrows in your hands.’
5.10.2.     Use of F-class singular om- for broken and half objectsFor inanimate referents which are broken, the prefix om- is always possible as
an alternative to the bundle, covering, long, and residue class prefixes:(40)      mén=o
          string_bag=PL.N1          gulel-halin-b-i=be
          PL.BUNDLE.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the string bags.’(41)      mén-o
          string_bag=PL.N1          om-halin-b-i=be
          3SG.F_CL.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the (heap of torn) string bags.’
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   201In this case, the use of the F-class singular prefix om- focuses on the fact that
the objects in question are indeed broken and thus not treated as individual
items anymore but more like a heap or a mass.
    The prefix om- is also employed for halves of formerly whole objects.
Compare:(42)   imen=e        ob-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.RESID.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the taro!’(43)   imen=e        om-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the half taro!’Again, the examples (42) and (43) are instances of reclassification. The
semantic features ‘broken mass’ or ‘half’ are not expressed in the noun but lie
exclusively in the classificatory prefix.

The noun phrase
6.0.     IntroductionMian noun phrase syntax is rigid. All noun phrases conform to the following
structural template, which specifies the structure of maximally complex noun
phrases:           Prenominal
Possessor
             adjective
                           Head     Postnominal
  Prenominal relative                              Quantifier   Determiner
                           noun     adjective(s)
        clause
  Prenominal modifierThe head noun slot can only hold an item of the category N, which includes
verbal nouns. A pronoun can instantiate a full noun phrase. Headless
adjectives can constitute a noun phrase of their own. In that case the head
noun slot is empty.
   Any material filling the possessor slot must be either a possessive pronoun
or a noun phrase. The prenominal adjective slot can accommodate one
adjective of the two sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’. The head noun can be
preceded by a prenominal relative clause or by one of two prenominal
modifiers omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. In these cases there must
not be a possessor. The postnominal adjective slot can be filled by one or
more adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are followed by quantifiers. The
determiner slot can be filled by the article or any of those pronouns which can
be used adnominally (Himmelmann 1997: 215-219).
   Table 6.1 lists examples illustrating noun phrases of different complexity.
All of these structures are discussed below. For a short overview of relative
clauses, see 6.3.8. For a detailed description of relative clauses, see 13.3.
   The normal situation in natural Mian discourse is that the clitic article
occurs only once on the rightmost constituent of a noun phrase that is used
referentially:(1)    tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog     black     big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’

noun phrase. It can show up on the noun itself, and on any adjectival
modifiers:(2)        tíl=e          milil=e        sm=e
           dog=SG.M black=SG.M           big=SG.M
           ‘a/the big, black dog’
6.1.         Pronouns as noun phrasesThe forms of all pronoun series (except the possessive pronoun) can be used
pronominally, i.e. they can constitute noun phrases by themselves. For details
on the form and the semantics of the respective pronoun series and for more
examples, see 3.7.
    All of these can occur in subject position. Free pronouns occasionally
occur in object position whereas the other pronoun series are so far only
attested in subject position.
    Forms from either of the reflexive series appear as objects if their function
is to indicate reflexivity:(3)        n     nmaye/neleskîl     gò’-Ø-i-obe

English ‘I myself killed the pig’, the pronoun can appear in apposition to an
overt subject noun phrase, as in (4) or on its own in lieu of an overt subject
noun phrase, as in (5):(4)      naka    le                  -maye            éil=o

6.2.      Minimal noun phrasesMinimal noun phrases consist either of a bare noun, i.e. a noun without any
determiner, or a noun followed by a determiner, e.g. a clitic article or an
adnominal pronoun.","[220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"
