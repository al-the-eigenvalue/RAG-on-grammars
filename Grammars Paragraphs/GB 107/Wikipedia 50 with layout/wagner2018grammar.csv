"3.1      Abessive
Clause negation can be expressed with a verb through the abessive marker.
While negation with the standard negative auxiliary verb simply negates, the
abessive verb conveys some extra meaning which cannot be described by sim-
ple means of logic. The word büümǝtumaɁaɁ does not convey the same mean-
ing as ńindɨɁ büɁ ‘they haven’t gone’. The form büümǝtumaɁaɁ means that ‘they
haven’t left yet’. The structure of the above sentences does not differ from the
structure of declarative sentences. Although these constructions do not belong
within the scope of negation from a syntactic perspective, this structure is a
case of sentence negation semantically speaking.
    The abessive can be used predicatively (abessive mood, cf. Section 5.10 in
Chapter 5) or attributively (abessive participle, cf. Section 6.2.4 in Chapter 5).
And what is more, the abessive participle can be derived into an adverb as
in sentence (31). Such verbs refer to actions that were expected to occur, but
have not occurred (‘not-yet’). All verbs except for negative auxiliaries can take
the abessive marker. Sentence (29) shows the verb usage, in sentence (30) the
abessive participle appears which takes the attributive position, while in sen-
tence (31), the adverbial form occurs.

           PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.0943.2     Negative Purposive Clause
Negative clauses of purpose are created by the negative supine form of the
main verb of the sub-clause, with the ending -mUŋkətə + (possessive suffix).
The nominal phrase typically appears at the beginning of the clause. If the
subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause are not the same, the
subject of the subordinate clause is either expressed by a possessive suffix on
the supine form, or by a nominal category in the genitive, or by both means, as
in sentences (32a–b).(32) a. ńuə        ďorə-lə-muŋkətə-tu,                 kundubtu-ŋu-ruɁ.

              KTD_86_BeturakuNy_flks844The negative supine form is rarely used in the texts, but instead of this form,
one of the supine markers appears on the negative auxiliary as in (33a–b). The
meaning is the same. (See Section 6.3, Chapter 5 for the supine suffixes.)

              MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.3743.3      Negative Questions and Their Affirmative Use
In negative questions, the negative auxiliary takes the appropriate inflections
and the main verb follows it in its connegative form. The question is mostly
dedicated to future and the negative auxiliary takes only the future marker as
in (34a). If the sentence is possessive or existential, the negative existential verb
ďaŋgujsʲa appears in its interrogative form, but it can use the negative existen-
tial particle ďaŋku as well. The sentence can express a real question or only pro-
vide emphasis. The negative element remains at the beginning of the sentence.(34) a. ńi-sɨðə-ŋ                tǝðu-Ɂ tobǝkǝǝ.
        neg.aux-fut-2sg.obc give-cng axe.acc

         ‘Don’t you have fish?’
              TNK, 2008The other type of negative question is not a real question; it is only used to
emphasize something. In such sentences, the negative auxiliary takes the inter-
rogative marker, but keeps its sentence-final position together with the main
verb (SOAuxV structure). This sentence structure can never be interpreted as
a real question. Note that although the sentences below are syntactically neg-
ative, the meaning is positive.(35) a. Ükaďaku tahari͡aa abaɁa-nə           ďa munuŋ-kə-suə:

                  MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.4373.4      Negative Lexical Words
There are some inherently negative lexical verbs and particles which are pre-
sented in Table 12.3.
   The most frequent verb with a negative lexical meaning is ďerusa ‘not know’.
The positive conterpart of this verb is čenɨďi ‘know’. The following sentence pair
shows how the positive and negative verbs are used. The sentences below illus-
trate that the structure is not symmetric; negation is not simply expressed by
the insertion of a negative element into the sentence, but in the negative sen-
tence the negative lexical element appears.","[441, 442, 443, 444]"
"2.2.1       Polar Question
Yes-no or polar questions do not require special word order. The word order
is usually the same as in the declarative sentence, but the order of elements

first position of the clause or sentence, if it is emphasized, as in example (38b).
The subject is normally covert in this sentence type, but if it is emphasized it
appears in the sentence.(38) a. tə, tɨŋ           kəmə-güə-bu-Ɂ            maa-güə

             KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017A question word usually occupies the first position in a sentence; however, this
is not compulsory. Nganasan is a so-called in-situ language. It means that the
question word remains in the position, in which a non-question word (answer)
with the same grammatical function will be located. Thus, the syntactic func-
tion and the information status determines the position of the question word.
However, the question word always takes the position before the predicate (Wh
X V order). Sentences (45a–c) are examples of a sentence with a question word
in the sentence initial position. It must be noted that all question words in
sentences (45a–c) can also take the sentence internal position as sentences
(46a–c) portray.(45) a. maaďa ńi-hi͡a-ðɨ                        tənə tu-čə čińi-Ɂ.

              PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.1042.2.3       Other Questions Types
Similar to some Siberian languages such as Evenki, Tuvin, Nenets etc., there
is a special interrogative verb which cannot be used in a declarative sentence:
kumun-sa ‘say what; tell what’. The verb is historically formed from the interrog-
ative stem ku- and the verb mun-sa ‘say’ and has a regular morphology. This verb
normally takes the interrogative marker as in kumuŋu, the interogtaive future
as in kumuntəŋu ~ kumunsuðə- or the interrogative iterative as in kumuŋkəə.
There are very few examples for dubitative and reportative interogative forms
as well. The verb can be negated with the negative auxiliary, has participial
forms and can take derivational suffixes such as passive and habituative. Ques-
tion words are always missing from such sentences. The following sentences
show the usage of this verb.(50) a. tǝ, kumu-ŋu-Ɂ            ńemɨ-čǝ.

examples for this type. They are used, if the speaker has some doubts. Struc-
turally, echo-questions are like polar questions. The following sentences illus-
trates this type. The second sentence is an example of an echo-question. As the
sentences show, the asked constituent is marked by an emphatic element.(51) maaďa Dʼajku-gumi?                – ńilɨ-gəlʲičə-tə-ŋɨ?

The emphatic use of a question is typical for all Northern Samoyedic language
(Nenets, Enets and Nganasan). In this sentence type the interrogative form of
the negative auxiliary appears. This kind of sentence can express rhetorical
questions (52a), simple assertions, and assertions deduced from the context
(52b). The word order is the same as in the simple negated construction, thus
the auxiliary precedes the main verb.(52) a. kərbu-Ɂsutə, maaďa ńi-ntə-ŋɨ                      kərbu-Ɂ,

2.3.1       Positive Imperative
The imperative has its own marker in all personal forms (including the first-
person singular); but the most common form is the second person singular
form. The tense of the imperative sentences is usually the aorist (i.e. imme-
diate future), it cannot be the past, but there are separate forms for future as
well. (For more about the personal markers see Section 5.2, Chapter 5.)
   The verb of the predicate in the imperative sentence typically takes the sen-
tence-final position, thus the word order in an imperative sentence is the same
as in a declarative sentence. The subject is not present in imperative sentences.(54) a. ǝiɁ, sʲelujki͡a-rə                tahari͡abə: tə sʲejmɨ-čə

The negative imperative is expressed with the imperative form of the standard
negative auxiliary (ńi-sɨ). The negative auxiliary in a prohibitive sentence takes
the same imperative ending as the main verb in the positive imperative sen-
tence. The imperative form of the auxiliary and the connegative of the main
verb together express prohibition. The negative auxiliary must precede the
main verb. In sum, the prohibitive structure uses the standard negative element
and the standard imperative strategy.(55) a. ŋanuďətə ŋəmsu ŋuəi-kalʲi-Ɂ ńi-Ɂ          mətu-Ɂ.

              ChND-KES_061107_Dialog_conv.057As can be seen above, the negative existential sentence has the same word order
as the declarative sentence: loc (coda) + theme (pivot) +verb.
   Negative locative sentences use the same negative elements as existential
sentences. The following sentences show the structure of the negative locative.
In the negated locative sentence the theme (pivot) element is always definite.
The only difference between existential and locative sentences is the word
order. In locative sentences the theme (pivot) takes the sentence-initial posi-
tion. If the coda is expressed, it usually appears before the negative element, as
in (17c), but it can take the sentence-final position as well. This may be due to
influence from Russian as in (17d).(17) a. ǝi,   huəðaa-Ɂkü-mə tə ďaŋku!

tive auxiliary, as in the following sentence. However, it must be mentioned that
this structure is very rare.

              ChND_041213_Hibula_flkd.0161.3.2       Negative Possessive Clauses
Possessive sentences can be turned into negative sentences in several ways. The
existential possessive sentence type can be negated by the negative existential
verb ďaŋgujsʲa or the negative existential particle ďaŋku. Similar to existential
and locative sentences, the particle ďaŋku is applied to the aorist tense, and
it must agree in number with the subject. However, the negative verb is used
in all three tenses (see sentences 16a–b and 17a–b above), and it must agree in
person and number with the subject. This verb can take mood markers as well
(cf. 16c and 20b). This sentence type expresses that the possessed entity is not
in the possession of the possessor.(20) a. mаа-gəlʲčə ńuə-ði            ďaŋku.

the beginning of the sentence as in (21).(21) ďaŋku-Ɂ         tənə     kola-čə.

           TNK 2008Apart from the negative existential verb, caritive suffixes can also express the
negation of a possessive structure. In this case, two structures can be differenti-
ated. The NP with the caritive suffix can appear either with an affirmative form
or with the negative existential verb. The latter likely originates from the con-
vergence of the nominative possessive presented above (Section 4.2 in Chap-
ter 8) and the caritive construction. It is difficult to decide what kind of dif-
ference in meaning there is between the two constructions, some consultants
no longer distinguish between the two forms. The first structure is potentially
more tentative than the second. According to a native speaker consultant, the
first structure (NP with caritive + verb isʲa) suggests that the possessor does not
have any of the possessed entities at all (see 22a–b). The possessee, functioning
as the adverbial complement in the sentence, takes the caritive suffix. The cop-
ula takes the regular inflectional suffixes, and it agrees in person and number
with the possessor.(22) a. kəntə-gəlʲičə-kalʲi i-ču.

both alienable and inalienable possession. In this sentence type the speaker
does not emphasize what the possession is, but rather the present state of the
possessor, namely that he or she does not have the given object at the given
time. As mentioned before, in this sentence type, the possession is the adver-
bial complement of the sentence.
   There is another possibility to negate a possessive sentence. In this sentence
type, the possessed NP takes on the caritive ending; however, it is not accom-
panied by the BE verb, but by the negative existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the
negative particle (ďaŋku). Therefore, this is a case of what is called double nega-
tion, however, the meaning is not affirmative, but negative. The possessee never
takes on a possessive personal ending. The negative existential verb must agree
with the possessed NP. As shown in the following example sentences, this con-
struction can be used for expressing both alienable and inalienable possession.
According to the consultants, with this sentence type, the speakers emphasize
that they do not own anything at all. In this construction the word order is (pos-
sessor) + negative existential + possessee in caritive.(23) a. mɨŋ ďaŋku-muɁ        nɨ-ki͡alʲi-Ɂ.

only very few examples of this in the corpus. The standard negative auxiliary
is followed by the connegative form of the verb honsɨ ‘have’. Tense and mood
markers are carried by the negative auxiliary.(24) a. ńuə ńi-sɨə                sani-j hon-ə-Ɂ.

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.3951.4      Negation of the Non-verbal Predicate
Negation in sentences with a non-verbal predicate depends on the tense. In
the aorist, the ńintuu(Ɂ) negative particle appears in the sentence immediately
before the predicate instead of the standard negative auxiliary. As the sentences
below demonstrate, in most cases the negative particle also takes verbal suf-
fixes, not only the nominal constituents of the predicate (see sentence 25a). It
can occur that either the negative particle or the nominal part does not take the
verbal suffixes in this construction. This happens relatively often in more care-
less speech meaning, if the speaker speaks quickly. If there is a possessive suffix
on the nominal predicate, only the negative particle takes the verbal inflec-
tions, as in sentence (25c) below.(25) a. tə, tərəďi i-hü-tü                      mənə ńintuu-m aniɁə-mənɨ

              JA_0609_TwoTents_flkd.254If the sentence is not in the aorist, the negative auxiliary must be used, because
the negative particle cannot have both the tense and mood markers. The aux-
iliary takes the tense marker and the verbal suffix, but the connegative form of
the copula also appears in the sentence. Future tense sentences with a nominal
predicate are formed in a similar manner as in past tense sentences. Thus, it can
be stated that Nganasan applies the nominal strategy for non-verbal predicates
and that this is independent of the type of the predicate.(27) a. sɨtɨ ńi-sɨə               {ńaagəə ŋuə-Ɂ}.

              TKF_061025_SongOfATsar_flks.056In negative sentences word order is partly fixed, as the negative verb is always
followed by the sentence constituent being negated—in this case, the nominal
predicate. The negated copula must immediately follow the predicate in such
sentences, and these two form a constituent. In other cases, the negative aux-
iliary and the connegative form of the verb tend to appear next to each other
(cf. Section 1.1 above).","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"
"1.1       Standard Negation
The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative
auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the con-
negative form of the main verb. In a negative phrase, the auxiliary always takes
mood and tense markers and inflectional suffixes and it agrees with the subject
in person and number, and, if the object is lexically covert, with the object in
number. The negated verb takes the connegative marker -ʔ, which is homony-
mous with the 2sg imperative marker. The connegative form of the verb isʲa
‘be’ is suppletive: ŋuəɁ. From a typological point of view, the standard negation
is asymmetric (cf. Misetamo 2005). This means that negative sentences differ
from affirmative ones not only in that there is a negative element present, but
also through structural differences. The paradigm of the negative auxiliary is as
follows.© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_013

The negative auxiliary is imperfective; therefore, it takes the aorist marker that
attach to imperfective verbs (-NTU and -NTA1, cf. Section 2.2 in Chapter 5).
Note, however, that the aspect value of the construction depends on the value
of the main verb and not on the aspect value of the auxiliary. Thus, the con-
struction ńindɨm tuɁ does not mean ‘I am not coming’, but ‘I did not come’
408                                                                   chapter 12because the aspect value of the main verb tujsʲa ‘come’ is [+perfective]. Accord-
ing to Gusev (2015: 107), in the Taimyr subdialect, the negative auxiliary can take
a perfective aorist marker (-Ɂǝ). However, there are only very few examples of
the auxiliary with a perfective aorist marker, thus this form is very rare. Sen-
tences (1a–b) show a verb inflected in the common imperfective form, while
sentence (2) is an example of a verb form inflected in its perfective form.(1) a. tə, ńi-ntɨ-gǝj           kumuŋ-kǝlʲičǝ-Ɂ.

                KES_080726_Family_nar.031The negative auxiliary can take not only tense and mood markers, but deriva-
tional suffixes as well. The available data suggest that while aspectual and voice
makers tend to appear on the lexical verb, Aktionsart is marked on the nega-
tive auxiliary, as in sentences (5a–c) below. If a negative sentence is transposed
into passive voice, the main verb takes the passive suffix, as illustrated by sen-
tences (6a–b). The distribution of grammatical categories is summarized in
Table 12.2.
   The following sentences provide examples of the distribution. The most fre-
quent derivational suffix on the negative auxiliary is the iterative suffix (-Kə),
but there are examples with habituative (-mUNHA), attenuative (-btA), imper-
fective (-NTə), and the resultative (-Ɂkə) suffix as well.(5) a. mənə ďa-tə-nə             ńi-gə-tɨ-Ɂ

(For auxiliaries, see Section 3.3, Chapter 3.) If the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ- is used,
the main verb (in this case, the negative auxiliary) always precedes this auxil-
iary and takes the connegative marker. On the other hand, the negated lexical
verb must also take the connegative marker. The negated main verb follows
the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ-. This means that in the sentence two verbs appear in the
connegative form: the negative auxiliary, and the negated lexical verb.(8) tə, əm-ɨ-čə              mintі͡agənɨ bəjna-ðu-r-sa

follows it, and the lexical verb follows the negative auxiliary, as in (9). However,
it must be pointed out that such examples are extremely rare, with only the two

sentence constituent can be inserted between the negative auxiliary and the
lexical verb. This constituent is generally expressed by a pronoun, negative
polarity items (10a), particles, or adverbs (10b).(10) a. helɨnɨ     ńi-gə-tɨ-Ɂ               maa-gəlʲičə təðu-Ɂ.

           JSM_090809_Life_nar.2331.2    The Negation of Non-declarative Sentences
As mentioned in Table 12.2, the mood markers appear on the negative auxiliary.
Synchronically, there is no separate prohibitive verb. However, it is possible that
negation                                                                                    413historically the negative auxiliary (ńi-) and the prohibitive verb were different
(see Helimski 2004b). The prohibitive verb was documented by Castrén as hav-
ing the form ńe-,1 but in the present state of the language, there is no reason to
differentiate two separate morphemes for these functions which are formally
the same (see 12 below). The negative auxiliary can freely take mood markers,
except for the abessive marker. The following pairs of sentences show impera-
tive and prohibitive structures. The prohibitive forms have no special structure.(12) a. tu-Ɂ        → ńi-Ɂ           tu-Ɂ
        come-imp.2sg neg.aux-imp.2sg come-cng
        ‘Come!’       ‘Don’t come!’      b. mətu-ðə        → ńi-tə              mətu-Ɂ
         cut-imp.2sg.obc neg.aux-imp.2sg.obc cut-cng
         ‘Cut it!’        ‘Don’t cut it!’The sentence pair (12a–b) above shows verbs with subjective and objective con-
jugation suffixes. The prohibitive sentences show that the imperative 2sg and
the connegative suffix (cng) are formally the same (-Ɂ). Furthermore, it is also
demonstrated that there is no special prohibitive suffix or special prohibitive
negative element. The imperative suffix is attached to the negative auxiliary.
The difference in the form of the suffix in sentence (12b) is due to consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1 in Chapter 2) and is not connected to negation. The
lexical verb is in its connegative form and positioned after the negative aux-
iliary. The sentences above also illustrate that although the structure itself is
asymmetrical, the paradigm is symmetrical. Each imperative form has its cor-
responding prohibitive counterpart.
    The negative auxiliary can take other mood markers as well. The follow-
ing sentence pair illustrates this with forms bearing the irrealis marker. The
declarative-negative pair shows that the negative auxiliary takes the same
mood marker as the main verb in the positive sentence. The negative element
is the standard negative auxiliary.(13) a. mɨŋ tətu-baaðəə-muɁ muraŋga-j,        mɨŋ ńi-sɨə-mɨɁ
        we bring-irr-1pl    cloudberry-acc.pl we neg.aux-pst-1pl1 The 2sg forms of the subjective conjugation are recorded by him as ńeɁ, the form of the objec-
  tive conjugation as ńetaɁ, the other form for negative auxiliary with ńi- (Castrén 1854: 493).
  For a more detailed description of the historical background, see Helimski (2004a: 35–36).

                ChND, 20081.3      Negation of Existential, Possessive and Locative Clauses
There are two negative existential elements used for negation in existential,
locative and possessive clauses. The verb ďaŋgujsʲa ‘not to exist’, which has
a full paradigm, and a negative particle ďaŋku ‘no’ used as a predicate in the
sentence. The other Northern Samoyedic languages do not have this particle-
like form, only the verb. The stem ďaŋku- has possible cognate verbs in Nenets
( jaŋko-), Enets (ďago-), Selkup (čaŋkɨ-) and a cognate word form in Kamas
(naga) as well as in Mator (ńäŋüh).2 For the negation of possessive sentences,
the negative auxiliary can also be used, if the possessive structure is expressed
by the have-verb honsɨ (see Section 1.3.2 below in this Chapter).","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433]"

              MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.590The negative verb ďerusa can take subjective and objective inflections, but not
reflexive ones. Derivational suffixes are rarely attached to ďerusa, but tense
markers can appear on this verb. In sentence (38) below, ďerusa takes a tense
marker, while in sentence (37) the iterative suffix is attached to it.(37) mɨŋ dazhe mɨŋ ďeru-kə-tu-muɁ                shto təi-ču-Ɂ

           KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017Semantically negative verbs such as ďerusa ‘not know’ can also be negated with
the negative auxiliary. In this case, the construction has a positive emphasized
meaning ‘it knows’ as in sentence (39) below. The negative auxiliary always
takes the interrogative marker. Negation in such sentences does not refer to
the presupposition and the answer must be positive.

means ‘I do not know’. It can appear as an answer to a question or it is a reaction
to an idea or event as in sentences (40a–b). The only referent of this particle can
be the actual speaker, it is not possible to refer to another person. It tends to take
the sentence or clause initial positio, but some discource particle precedes it.(40) a. sɨlʲiɁi͡a,      əməni-ə kundu͡a-tu.

the verb ŋimsʲasʲi is illustrated in the sentence pair (42a–b). In sentence (42a)

         chapter 13Clause CombiningIn complex sentences, two or maybe more predicative relations are expressed,
which in European languages usually relate to a syntactic connecting ele-
ment (for example with a conjunction or relative pronoun etc.). Like in other
Samoyedic and Siberian languages, true complex sentences are not character-
istic for Nganasan, they are quite rare. Meanings expressed by a subordinate
clause in English for example, are mainly expressed by non-finite verb forms
(e.g. participles or converb construction).
   This chapter provides an overview of the common features of the traditional
clause combining strategies such as coordination and subordination. In coordi-
nated clauses, the clauses are linked together which have the same function and
are syntactically not dependent one on another. In contrast with coordinated
clauses, subordinated clauses depend on the main (matrix) clause and they
function as a constituent. There are several types of subordinate clauses: com-
plement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses. Section 1 deals with
coordination, complementation is presented in Section 2, Section 3 describes
the adverbial clauses, while Section 4 gives an overview of the relativization
strategies.","[444, 445, 446, 447, 448]"

overview of the history of the Nganasan people (Section 1). Basic information
about genealogical affiliation, dialects, sociolinguistic status of the language
and the typological profile are described in Section 2. Section 2.5 presents the
Cyrillic orthography as well as the writing system used in this volume. Section
3 provides an overview of previous works on Nganasan and describes the lan-
guage data used in this grammar.","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

2       Constituent NegationConstituents are negated by the negative particle ńintuu, which appears imme-
diately before the negated constituent. The same particle is used to negate
non-verbal predicates (cf. Section 1.4 above). If tense or mood is expressed in
the clause, a copula is not needed, because only the negated item stays in the
scope of the negation. Tense markers are carried by the main verb, but the latter
is not in the scope of the negation.

a special suffix, the abessive. Additionally, the supine also has a negative form,
and some verbs can also be found which express an inherently negative mean-
ing.","[440, 441]"
"1.3.1        Negative Existential and Locative Clauses
As mentioned in Section 3, Chapter 9, the predicate of the existential or loca-
tive sentences is expressed either with the verb təisʲa or tənijsʲa. The existential
verb tǝij- cannot be negated by the negative auxiliary; in this case, the negative
existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the negative particle (ďaŋku) must be used. The
structure of sentences with the negative existential verb is the same as that of
declarative sentences. Sentences (14a–b) show the usage of the negative par-
ticle. It agrees only in number with the subject, while the negative existential
verb agrees with it in number and person. Sentence (14a) shows a predicate in2 Helimski (1997: 318/742) reconstructs the stem *jaŋko- for PS (by Janhunen (1977: 40) *jäŋkɜ).
  In my opinion, this PS form has been retained as a particle; the negative existential verb is a
  more recent grammaticalized form consisting of the negative existential predicate ďaŋku and
  the BE verb isʲa (ij-). Otherwise, the infinitive form of the verb according to morphophono-
  logical rules would be ďaŋkuďa. Castrén (1854: 490–491) still states that this element cannot
  carry any suffixes but is followed by the BE verb.

agrees logically with the subjects. Both elements take the predicate position,
thus they are sentence-final.(14) a. maa-gəlʲčə koruɁ ďaŋku,                maa-gəlʲčə ďaŋku.

                PED_080731_Competition_nar.089The negative existential verb and the negative particle can both be used in
the aorist, where they are in free variation (cf. sentence 15). In the past and
future tense, however, only the negative existential verb can appear, as only
it can carry the tense and mood markers (see sentences 16a–c). This can be
understood as further evidence for the origin of this verb as a grammaticalized
combination of a particle and the BE verb.","[433, 434]"
"2.1      Postpositional Coding
If the beneficiary is an NP or expressed with the demonstrative pronouns used
as personal pronouns, the construction is postpositional and the postposition
402                                                                  chapter 11ďaðiɁkü ~ ďaðükü ‘for, for the sake of’ must be used. The stem of this postposi-
tion is the postposition ďa, the origin of the other constituent is unclear.
   If the beneficiary is expressed by a pronoun or demonstrative (10a) the
postposition takes the possessive suffix corresponding to person and num-
ber. This construction can only express a beneficiary, if the NP has the feature
[+human]. In other instances, the postposition is either an allative marker of
direction or expresses the meaning of ‘for the sake of’. The word order is always
beneficiary—theme.(10) a. beneficiary                                theme
        təndə-tɨ          ďaðükü-tü      baďa      ŋomtüsʲan-ə

              KNT_940903_KehyLuu.178Similar to the recipient, the beneficiary can also be covert in the sentence. In
this case, the destinative suffix and the possessive suffix indicate the person
and the number of the beneficiary, as seen in sentences in (11). The NP marked
with the destinative is the theme of the ditransitive construction. The agent
of the sentence is almost always expressed with only the verbal ending, if it is
overt as in (11c), it takes the clause-initial position.(11) a. tə-tə,     ma-tə-mə           mej-ku-ðəm.

              ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.063When destinative NPs function as subjects of the intransitive sentence, the con-
struction can also be qualified as benefactive. This construction occurs rarely.
The NP appears in the subject position and takes the destinative suffix (-tǝ/-ðǝ)
and the possessive suffix. The possessive suffix indicates the number and per-
son of the beneficiary. Subject destinative NPs take possessive markers for the
nominative only. This construction is not very frequent, only 10 % of the bene-
factive constructions are of this type. Most often, this sentence type contains
the verbs tujsʲa ‘come’, ŋǝtumsa ‘become visible; be born’ and the negative par-
ticle ďaŋku. For a depiction of the structure, see the sentences in (12). This kind
of construction appears not only in Nganasan, but also in Enets (cf. Khanina &
Shluisky 2014).(12) a. ńaaďətə-ďa              munu-ŋkə-ndu-Ɂ ńuə-ðə-muɁ

              ChND_041212_Girl_flkd.1413       Coding the ThemeAs has already been mentioned, the theme of the ditransitive sentence in most
cases remains in the accusative. Passive sentences are exceptions; for more on
this, see Section 1.3 above. With imperative forms, the theme is in the nomina-
tive; for more on the form of the imperative object, see Section 1.2.4, Chapter 10.
   The personal suffix of the verb may also indicate the direct object, thus the
theme can be overt under certain circumstances, as in (13a–b). However, this
is only possible, if the theme has already been indicated in the preceding sen-
tences, so in the given sentences it would be possible to use only the personal
pronoun. In these cases, the personal endings on the verb are used to indicate
the theme instead of a personal pronoun. Normally, the agent in such cases is
also not overt.(13) a. recipient covert agent and theme

              KNT_940903_KehyLuu.183This construction cannot be used with speech act verbs, because they have no
form in the objective conjugation; at the same time, as has already been men-
tioned above, the objects of these verbs are mostly subordinated sentences.
         chapter 12NegationThis chapter deals with the ways in which negation can be formed. Negation is
a well-studied topic, thus in this chapter only the most important features are
summarized. (For more details on negation, see Wagner-Nagy 2011 and Gusev
2015.) Nganasan, like many Uralic languages, has negative auxiliaries, but it uses
a negative particle as well. The elements of negation are mostly in complemen-
tary distribution, i.e. in a certain sentence type, only one kind of negative ele-
ment can be used. Only the negative existential particle ďaŋku and the negative
existential verb ďaŋgujsʲa are interchangeable under certain circumstances.
Table 12.1 below summarizes the forms and usage of the negation elements.
   This chapter is structured as follow: In Section 1, sentence negation is de-
scribed. The constituent negation is presented in Section 2. Other negative
construction such as negation of purposive sentences or negative lexical verbs
etc. are described in Section 3.","[420, 421, 422, 423, 424]"

              TKF_031117_ThreeBrothers_flk.4234.4      Question Words
Quention words are used in wh-questions (content questions). They can be
classified according to the type of information they seek, and also according
to inflectional properties. Part of them shares the morphosyntactical proper-
ties with nouns, another part with adverbs. The group of declinable interrog-
atives can take number markers, the destinative suffix and possessive suffixes,
word classes                                                                             131such as ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘what kind of’, ‘which’ and ‘how many’. The interrogatives
maaŋuna ‘what for’ and sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ bare only number markers and they
can be followed by verbal suffixes as well. The word maaŋuna can be used
also with meaning ‘what kind of’ (cf. sentence (43b) in Section 2.2.2 of Chap-
ter 10). Interrogatives that behave like adverb are morphologically unchange-
able, maaďa ‘why’. Additionally, there is a question verb kumunsa ‘say what’1
(cf. Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10). The following chart shows the most important
question words.(65) sɨlɨ ‘who’         maa ‘what’              kuďübtu ‘which’   kanə ‘how many’
     sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ maaŋuna                 kurəďi ‘what kind kaŋgə ‘when’

                        maaðə ‘why’             kunini ‘where’
                                                kunuŋu ‘where’To reference humans, the question words sɨlɨ ‘who’ and sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ are
used. The interrogative sɨlɨŋuna ‘who for’ is the emphatic form of sɨlɨ like Hun-
garian kicsoda ‘what for’. Interrogatives ‘who’, ‘who for’ and ‘what for’ often stay
in the predicate position, in this case, they have non-referential use. This is
demonstrated by the following sentences.(66) a. təti kobtu-Ɂu͡a munu-ntu komənsəj tənə sɨlɨ-ŋ

tinative forms have a benefactive function, which is discussed in more detail

suffix, it does not express a possessive relation, rather a question about which
person out of a given group did something, cf. sentence (67c).(67) a. … ou     tətə sɨlɨ i-čǝŋu        tətɨ ŋanasa-gümü

           TNK, 2008The interrogative word maa ‘what’ or maaŋuna ‘what for’ is used for non-
human animate (animals) and non-human inanimate (things). In some cases,
maa can occur in an attributive position, as sentence (70b) demonstrates.(70) a. ou maaŋuna əməniə ńeraɁa-mə …

              KNT_940903_KehyLuu.118In special cases, the interrogative word ‘what’ can also be used for a human ref-
erent. This happens, when the person asking the question wants to find out the
other person’s clan affiliation. Clan names can be animal names or names of
things (e.g. hu͡aləə ‘belonging to stone’). The pair of sentences in (71) provides
an example of such a question and the answer given.(71) a. əə, tənə maaŋuna?

           ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.124Several emphatic forms of the question words also exist, after which the limita-
tive suffix is followed by emphatic suffixes—most often -güə—as in maaraagüə
‘only what’. The limitative forms of maa ‘what’ are often used: maa-raa-Ɂ ‘what-
lim-pl’ maa-raa-j ‘what-lim-acc.pl’. The limitative form of the interrogative
can be used as an indefinite pronoun as well. For indefinites see Section 4.5
below.(73) təti ńuǝ-Ɂ, sɨlɨ-ri͡aa-Ɂ hojki-r-kə-ndu-Ɂ.

           ChNS_080214_Wandering_nar.024There are two lexemes that mean ‘why’. Both are formed from the interrogative
pronoun maa ‘what’. One is mаа-ðə-(poss), in which the stem maa is followed
by the elative adverbial suffix (cf. Section 5 below), which is optionally followed
by a possessive suffix, mostly in the second person form. Another form of the
question word ‘why’ is maaďa, which is the lexicalized form of the interrogative
pronoun maa ‘what’ followed by the allative postposition ďa. No data clarifies
whether these two lexemes can be used interchangeably. It seems that maaďa
is more frequent than the interrogative form maaðǝ-. The following sentences
show the use of these words.(74) a. mаа-ðə-tə                 ŋəm-ə-btu-guj-ŋа-čə

              KES_080721_Disease_flkd.021If the maa ‘what’ is used together with the copula, it expresses the meaning of
purpose ‘for what, why?’. In this case, the interrogative pronoun is followed by
the infinitive form of the copula, which is followed by a finite form of the verb.(75) ouɁ, əmɨ-čǝ              maaŋ maa i-sʲa ǝmǝ

           ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.015The interrogatives for local cases are polymorphemic; they are based on the
interrogative stem ku-, which is of Proto-Samoyedic origin. Normally, they con-
tain one of the ancient case endings which appear on adverbs of place. Usu-
ally, no further suffixes are attached to these words. These interrogatives have
only singular forms. The forms of the interrogatives for local cases are given in
(76):

The lative form kuniɁi͡a ‘where’ and the interrogative ‘how’ are homonymic.
Sentence (77a) demonstrates the use of the word ‘how’, while (77b) displays
the use of ‘where to?’. The question word in sentence (78) is kuni, which is also

           TKF_061105_MasterOfIdols_flk.763The question word ‘where’ has three forms, kunini, kunu and kunuŋu. The form
kunu is composed of the interrogative word ku- and the adverbial locative suf-
fix -nu (for adverbial endings, see Section 5 below), but this form is very rare
(80). The form kunuŋu is formed from the ku-nu question word and the inter-
rogative marker -ŋu (cf. Section 5.5 in Chapter 5). The form kunuŋu agrees in
number with the subject, as sentences (81a–b) shows. The form kunini is also
used, which is composed of the pronominal stem ku- (82). The following sen-
tence shows the use of these question words.(80) taaču-guj-čuə-muɁ                   əmtɨ kunu?

              TNK, 20084.5      Indefinites
Indefinites are formed by attaching emphatic clitic-like morphemes to inter-
rogatives. There are three sets of indefinites: one is formed with the clitic -Küǝ
(-küə/-güə), the other is derived with the suffix -Cčə/-Cči, while the third set is
built with the suffix -CčəKüə. The suffix -CčəKüə is composed of -Cčə and -Küə.
The ordering of the morphemes is strict. (For information on clitic-like mor-
phemes see Section 4.1.6 above and Section 7 of Chapter 16.) The interrogative
derived with the limitative suffix -RA2a can express indefinite meaning as well.
   By building locative indefinites, the adverbial case marker is attached after
the emphatic clitic-like morpheme: kuni-čə-nu ‘anywhere’ [pronstem-emph-
adv.loc]. (The adverbial case markers are discussed in Section 10 below.)
Indefinites can be classified according to their morphological make-up, seman-
tics and specificity, cf. Table 3.4 below.
   Indefinites can be specific and non-specific. Non-specific forms (derived by
-Küə) refer to entities that are unknown to the speaker, while specific forms
refer to an entity that is either known or unknown to the speaker.
   The indefinite forms with -Cčǝ indicate that the referent is identifyable to the
speaker, i.e. the speaker knows who the referent is, as sentences (86a–b) show.(86) a. sɨlɨ-čə    munu-Ɂsutə, tə   ŋomtü-tüə-gitə munu-Ɂsutə …

              MDN_97_Song_song.0774.6       Negative Polarity Items
There are special NPI forms, which are derived from the interrogatives, simi-
lar to indefinites. The interrogative pronominal stem is followed by the -kəlʲičə
emphatic morpheme, as maa-gəlʲičə ‘whatever’, sɨlɨ-gəlʲičə ‘whoever’ etc. This
emphatic morpheme is identical to the emphatic suffix of personal pronouns
(cf. Section 4.1.6 above). The morpheme -kǝlʲičǝ does not carry a negative mean-
ing in itself, which is indicated by the fact that it can occur in affirmative sen-
tences as well—although in such cases it is not connected to the question word
as sentence (92) shows. The negative polarity items need a verbal licensor to
function as negative indefinites (see 93b below).(92) təniɁi͡a ďübi͡a-l-məbtɨ-rɨ-Ɂi-ðə,            təti

5       AdverbsAdverbs are used either as verbal modifiers or clausal adjuncts. Adverbs can
be classified according to their semantic characteristics or their morphological
make-up. Adverbs can be semantically divided into the following subclasses:
degree, locative, directionality and time adverbs. They can take inflectional suf-
fixes: the spatial adverbs have a locative paradigm. This section first describes
the morphological structure of adverbs then classifies them according to their
semantic properties.","[149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162]"

PrefaceThis grammar examines the Nganasan language, an endangered Samoyedic
language, which belongs to the Uralic language family. This description is based
on the materials from the Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC) which
was created as part of the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan
project (supported by the German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1, for informa-
tion about the corpus see details in Section 4, Chapter 1). Most of the examples
are taken from this corpus and are passages from spontaneously produced
texts. Another portion of examples are elicited materials, produced either
spontaneously or in response to questions. Data which rely on existing gram-
matical descriptions (as e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.) are
also occasionally used.
   Examples are provided in phonological transcription form with morpheme-
by-morpheme glossing. Morphemes are separated with hyphens, multi-word
categories in glosses such as ‘elderly sister’ are linked by a dot as in ‘elderly.sis-
ter’. Grammatical categories which are not expressed by a separate morpheme
are linked by a dot as in run.3sg. Nominative singular is never marked. Words
which are necessary in the English translation, but are absent in the original
text are bracketed, the only exception are the personal pronouns. Because Nga-
nasan is a consistent pro-drop language, personal pronouns only appear in
sentences seldom. The Nganasan personal pronouns are not marked for gen-
der. For the sake of economy, they are translated as ‘s/he’.
   This grammar is intended to be a comprehensive description of modern
Nganasan, which follows the traditional structure. It consists of 16 chapters
and two glossed texts. The introduction describes the sociolinguistic situation,
a brief history, typological features and gives information about the corpus
used in this grammar (Chapter 1). The phonetic features and phonological pro-
cesses are presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also deals with the phonological
and morphophonological alternations found in the data. Chapter 3 gives an
overview of the classification of the different kinds of words (word classes).
Morphological features are discussed in Chapter 4 (Nominal inflection) and
Chapter 5 (Verbal inflection). Chapter 6 and Chapters 8–13 describe the syntac-
tical and some semantic properties such as noun phrases, types of predicates,
simple and complex sentences, verbal valence and evidentiality. Pragmatic
organization is shown in Chapter 14, while Chapters 7 and 16 describe the word
formation processes. In Chapter 15 some basic informations are given about the
core vocabulary. The reason for this is that it has traditionally been one of the
most neglected area in the study of Samoyedic languages. This description is

interlineal glosses. One text is a short folklore text, the other text is a biograph-
ical narrative.
AcknowledgmentsWork on this book took its first concrete form in 2006 during my work with
Zuszsa Várnai, Sándor Szeverényi, Nóra Wenszky and Attila Novák on the Nga-
nasan morphological analyzer within the Project “Morphological analyzer of
Nganasan” supported by Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary, project
number K60807). Thanks to my fabulous colleagues, I learned very much not
only about the Nganasan phonology and grammar, but about grammar writ-
ing in general. My ideas came to a final formulation during my works with
Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev and Sándor Szeverényi on a Nganasan corpus.
This project was supported by the Deutsche Forschungesgemeinschaft (DFG,
Germany, project number WA 3153/2–1).
   I would like to thank here all persons who helped me to complete my study
on Nganasan. First, I wish to thank Tibor Mikola and Eugen Helimski, who first
introduced me to the Nganasan language and culture and who made my first
fieldwork trips to the Taimyr Peninsula possible. My fieldwork opportunities
were supported by a grant from Soros Foundation awarded to me in 1996, the
Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary) awarded to me in 2007, a project
grant from Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF, Aus-
tria) awarded to Johanna Laakso in 2008, and a project grant from the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Germany).
   Very special thanks go to my colleagues, Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev,
Oksana Dobzhanskaya, and Alexandre Arkhipov, who helped me to organize
the expeditions and who helped me during my fieldworks.
   I also thank my colleagues Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev, Jean-Luc Lambert,
Zsuzsa Várnai, Oksana Dobzhanskaya and Sándor Szeverényi for sharing with
me their field recordings and permitting me to continue researching.
   My gratitude also goes to Anna Fenyvesi, Gerrit Jawinsky, Hannah Wegener
and Alexander David Curtis for reading and correcting the manuscript of this
book. I would like to thank Marianne Bakró-Nagy, Valentin Gusev, Gerson
Klumpp and Sándor Szeverényi, who commented on the previous versions of
this grammar. Their remarks were helpful for my work. I would also like to thank
Brill: my work with the staff of the publisher has been very pleasant at all stages
of the production of this book.
   Of course, my deepest gratitude goes to my consultants in Usť-Avam, Volo-
chanka and Dudinka. Special thanks are due to my parents, to my daughter and
to my husband for their understanding, patience and emotional support.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

                 KBD_71_Relationship_nar.008The quantifier bǝnsǝ ‘all, the whole’ can take possessive suffixes as well. In this
case, the meaning is ‘all of us’. The possessive suffix refers to who belongs to the
group. These items always stand by themselves, that is, in this case, they are not
modifiers. The form bǝńďikaa cannot be marked for possessivity.(142) bənsə-muɁ kuə-sutə-bаŋhu-muɁ, əmtɨ gorodǝ bənsə bəńďikaa

              TKF_061105_MasterOfIdols_flk.464The quantifiers can be used attributively and predicatively. If the indefinite
numeral is in the predicate position, it takes the predicative suffixes, as in sen-
tence (143a). If it remains in the attribute position, it must agree with the head

Conjunctions are rarely used. Juxtaposition of coordinated phrases or sen-
tences is much more frequent. However, members of the younger generation,
who speak Russian well, also use Russian conjunctions. The word ŋonəə ‘and,
again, furthermore, one more’ can optionally appear as a coordinating con-
junction, primarily appearing between coordinated phrases. The Russian i ‘and’
can also be used to fulfill this function. Sentence (144a) demonstrates the
conjunction-like use of ŋonəə, whereas (144b) depicts the use of the Russian

meaning ‘but’, when used to link sentence parts or sentences. In the sentence
(146b), tətilʲi͡aiɁ appears as a particle, while in (146a) it acts as conjunction. As
a linking element, it assumes the first position in a clause.(146) a. murɨŋga-Ɂ       ńaagəə-Ɂ, tətiɁlʲi͡aiɁ bəðu͡a-mətumaɁa-Ɂ

                 KNT, 19948.2      Particles
Particles are quite often used. Emphasis is often expressed through morpho-
logical means in this language, i.e. emphatic suffixes or particles, which have
discourse-related meaning. Besides emphasis, particles can express condition-
ality, uncertainty, limitation or negation.
   In contrast to Nenets and Enets, there are two negative particle-like element:
ńintu(u) and ďaŋku. Both can be inflected predicatively, i.e. they can take verbal
inflections in present, but no tense marking elements for the future or past. The
particle ńintu(u) is used to negate a non-verbal predicate. The word ďaŋku is
used to negate existential, locative, and possessive sentences. (For use of these
elements see Chapter 12 for negation.)
   In general, particles do not take derivational and inflectional suffixes, thus
they are unchangeable. However, several particles can take verbal or nomi-
nal inflectional morphemes. For example, ŋɨɁtə- must take a possessive suffix,
while some others, like the negative particles ńintu(u) and ďaŋku can take ver-
bal inflectional suffixes, if they occupy the predicate position in a sentence.
Only the most frequently used particles are discussed below. What position
these words can take in a sentence and which suffixes can attach to them is
given. Particles have not been described in detail, and the analysis of text-level
discourse has yet to be pursued further.1. əku ‘maybe, probably’: This particle always appears after the predicate, gen-
erally at the end of the sentence. The verb in the sentence is mostly in the
indicative, but can take the irrealis marker (for irrealis see Section 4.8 in Chap-
ter 5). The particle ŋəndiɁaiɁ ‘probably’ has a similar meaning also expressing
uncertainty (see below). The auxiliary verb əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe’ discussed in Sec-
tion 3.3 above also has the same meaning. The auxiliary and the particle clearly
go back to the same proto-form.(148) a. tə, raďivi-čuŋ        təi-sʲüə  əku

                   KSM-ChND_061105_Hotarye_flkd.0252. kasaɁ ‘nearly, slightly’: This particle can be connected to the auxiliary kasa-
ďa ‘almost, nearly’ (cf. Section 3.3). The particle always occurs before the word
it modifies.(149) təti-rə        maaŋuna kasaɁ səəna-mun-tuə        tɨbɨjki͡a

                KSM-ChND_061105_Hotarye_flkd.0273. mɨntu ‘can, is allowed, possible’: The particle is mostly preceded or followed
by a conditional form or by a conjugated form of the main verb. It expresses
general truth.(150) ŋəndi͡aiɁ latəi-ńə        hebɨ-m-hiɁ          ŋəndi͡aiɁ mɨntu

‘be’ verb, which has grammaticized and become a particle. It is very often used
in narrative texts. It normally appears at the end of a statement or sentence (cf.
Section 4.7 in Chapter 5 below for reportative mood).(151) tɨmini͡a maaďaa munu-ŋu-Ɂ       pervovo avgusta

              KECh_080214_Childhood_nar.1825. ŋəndiɁi͡aiɁ ‘probably’: This particle is used to express uncertainty regarding
the evaluation of an event. The particle appears immediately before the word it
modifies, as in sentence (152). Here the uncertainty refers to age, so the particle
occurs immediately before the number that expresses the age.(152) mənə ŋəndiɁi͡aiɁ mətüʔ i-sʲüəďəə                hüə-mə,

cle. It is not clear how the two particles differ in usage and meaning. (See this

"3.3     Auxiliaries
The number of auxiliaries is quite low. One of them (ńisɨ) carries a negative
meaning. The true predicate of a negative phrase (NegP) is formed from a
negative auxiliary with a personal suffix. The main verb is in its connegative
form, which always follows the auxiliary. For information on negation see the
detailed account given in Chapter 12. The other part of auxiliaries does not have
a negative meaning, but they are followed or preceded by the main verb in con-
negative form (cng). The only exception is the verb konɨďi ‘go’ as an auxiliary.
The attested auxiliaries and the auxiliary constructions are listed below.",[118]

The auxiliary kasaďa with the meaning ‘almost, nearly’ was described in tradi-

tive auxiliary, but actually it carries no negative meaning (see also Gusev 2015:
128). The auxiliary is followed by the connegative form of the main verb. It
can be conjugated in all conjugation types. Sentence (7b) shows the verb in
reflexive conjugation, sentence (7a) in the subjective, and (7c) in the objective
conjugation.(7) a. tahari͡a munu-munu-ču: kaj, tǝti kasa-Ɂa-m        ŋǝnǝbta-Ɂ.

sentence for connegative forms, i.e. it cannot appear as a main verb in a nega-
tive phrase. Examples with a derivational suffix are sporadic. As sentence (7b)
above shows, the lexical verb normally takes the passive marker. However, the
auxiliary can also take, for example, the passive suffix, which can even be fol-
lowed by inflectional suffixes, and the lexical verb can also take a derivational
suffix. This is shown by sentence (9).(8) təndɨ-čə         ɨsɨəbüə kasa-ďüə-Ɂ        mənə ŋüü  ďa sarə-Ɂ.

           TKF_99_TwoShamans_flkd.161The particle kasaɁ ‘nearly, all but’ is associated with the auxiliary, as exempli-
fied in Section 8.2 below.3.3.2       ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly, be unable’
The auxiliary ləðiʔsʲ can be classified as a type of negative auxiliary and trans-
lated as ‘cannot, be unable’, which is followed by the connegative form of the
main verb. The auxiliary is imperfective and occurs only with imperfective
verbs. It can take derivational suffixes (10b), tense markers (10c), and can be
inflected in the subjective (10a), reflexive (10d), and objective (10e) conjuga-
tion. Which conjugation is used depends on what conjugation the verb would
be in, if not in a construction involving an auxiliary. The use of conjugations
is discussed in Section 1, Chapter 9. The following examples demonstrate the
usage of the auxiliary. The opposite of this verb is the verb tukəďa ‘be able’, an
example is given in (11c) below.(10) a. mənə təɁ            təbtə ləði-ti-m     ńilɨ=əi-Ɂ!

              ASS_161023_Djajku1_flkd.0143.3.3       əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’
The auxiliary əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’ behaves like the imperfective verbs,
but its paradigm is defective. It does not have an infinitive form, and does not
take tense or mood markers. Unlike kasaďa ‘almost, nearly’ and ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly,
be unable’, this auxiliary takes the sentence final position, thus the main verb in
the connegative form precedes it. It is peculiar in that it assimilates to the lexi-
cal verb in terms of suffix alternation. (For information about suffix alternation
see Section 7.2 in Chapter 2.) It can be safely assumed that it evolved from the
particle əku (see Section 12.2 below). Thus, in principle, a process of lexical-
ization and not of grammaticalization can be observed. The auxiliary can be
conjugated by all conjugation types. The usage of the auxiliary is illustrated by
the sentences below.(11) a. mənə kačəmə-hu͡aðəə, kəči       mənə ńimsʲa-sɨəďəə-mə təibə-Ɂ

              TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.2323.3.4       ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not; of course’
The auxiliary ŋuǝlɨ- means something like ‘of course, how can you think I/you/
he will not; how could I/you/he not’. The majority of descriptions referred to
ŋuəlɨ- as a monomorphemic verbal stem (Tereshchenko 1979: 261; Katzsch-
mann 1993–1994: 58), but in my opinion, the stem of the word is ŋuə-, which
is followed by the dubitative suffix -lɨ- and the personal marker (for dubitative
see Chapter 5, Section 5.11). It is possible that the stem is related to the particle
ŋuəlɨ ‘of course, naturally’ particle, but the direction of the evolution process
cannot be determined. The meaning of the stem ŋuə- is not absolutely clear, but
the S2 stem of the BE verb (i-sʲa) is also ŋuə-. Therefore, it is possible that the
dubitative form of the BE verb was grammaticalized as an auxiliary. However,
this supposition needs to be tested further.
    This auxiliary is always followed by the connegative form of a lexical verb,
which suggests that ŋuəlɨ- is an auxiliary whose infinitive form does not ap-
pear among the data. This means, this is an auxiliary with a defective paradigm.
Although, there is very little data available with the ŋuəlɨ- auxiliary, but it is un-
derstood that, ŋuǝlɨ- can be conjugated in all conjugation types, though it never
combines with the aorist marker (-NTA or -Ɂə, see Section 4.1 in Chapter 5) or
other tense markers. This auxiliary cannot take derivational suffixes, but em-
phatic suffixes do attach to it, as sentence (12a) illustrates. There are however
only very few examples for this available. There are examples for the auxiliary
conjugated in the subjective (12a–b), objective (12d) and reflexive (12c).(12) a. tə mənə ďeðɨka-Ɂa i-sʲa, maa bən-ə

The verb konɨďi with the meaning ‘go away’ is also used as an auxiliary in
resultative and translative clauses with the meaning ‘to become something,
to change to’. It appears with nouns as well as with adjectives and numerals.
The auxiliary is obligatorily preceded by a nominal part of the construction
and the infinitive form of the BE verb isʲa. In interrogative sentences, the aux-
iliary takes the interrogative marker as in (13b). For detailed description on the

           KVB_97_EvilSpirit.0274       Pronominal ItemsNganasan has personal, interrogative, demonstrative pronouns and intensi-
fiers. Human beings are referred by personal pronouns, while animals, plants
and objects by demonstratives. There are no dedicated possessive pronouns;
this is expressed using personal pronouns (see Section 4.1.7). Indefinites are
derived from question words using the -küə/-güə, -čə clitic-like morphemes (see
Section 7.3 and Chapter 16). There are no special negative pronouns, the ques-
tion words with the emphatic clitic -kəlʲičə/ -gəlʲičə may be treated as negative
polarity items (see Section 4.6 below). Neither relative, nor reflexive pronouns
are present. The reflexive or reciprocal meaning is covered by the word hütəðə
‘body’, by the word ńa ‘companion, friend’ with the possessive suffix, and by
the word sɨɁ ‘image of living things’ marked for the relevant personal posses-
sive suffix (15). If in this kind of sentences the intensifier ŋonə- appears, it has
an emphatic intensified meaning. Another possibility for expressing a reflexive
situation is the usage of reflexive conjugation; cf. Section 3.3 in Chapter 5.(15) a. ďerutu-mi     ńa-ńi.

              ChND, 20094.1       Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns can only refer to humans, animals and plants, while objects
are referred to by demonstrative pronouns, but occasionally demonstratives
refer to humans as in sentence (17c). There is no gender distinction.
    All three numbers (sg, du, pl) and each person has a corresponding per-
sonal pronouns, making nine personal pronouns altogether. Special honorific
forms (such as Hungarian ön, or the use of plural forms in this function, as
in German Sie (3pl) or Russian Vy (2pl)) do not exist, however there are few
examples for the use of 2pl personal pronoun in this function. This is obviously
due to Russian influence.
    The behaviour of personal pronouns is the most noteworthy aspect of pro-
nouns. Although they cannot be inflected in the way other nominal categories
can, several emphatic clitic-like suffixes can be attached (cf. Section 4.1.4).
These emphatic markers may attach to other pronouns as well.
    The 3sg, 3du and 3pl forms of personal pronouns are derived from the noun
sɨʔ ‘portrayal, picture, image (of living things)’ followed by corresponding pos-
sessive suffixes. The forms are shown below:(16) Personal pronouns              sg            du                      pl1st person mənə ‘I’       mii ‘the two of us’    mɨŋ ‘we’
2nd person tənə ‘you’     tii ‘the two of you’   tɨŋ ‘you’
3rd person sɨtɨ ‘she, he’ sɨti ‘the two of them’ sɨtɨŋ ‘they’
Personal pronouns most often function as the subject of a sentence. If the
pronoun is the subject,—Nganasan being a consistent null-subject language—
it is only optional; the verb inflection replaces the pronouns. Overt personal
pronouns are only used in contexts where they have special discourse signifi-
cance, such as emphasis. Sentence (17a) is an example with an overt pronoun
in the subject position, while in sentence (17b) only the verbal ending refers
to the number and person of the subject. (More about this topic see in Chap-
ter 9). To the 3rd person humane referent in subject position can refer to the

person possessive suffix. Some speaker use instead the anaphoric demonstra-
tive the distant deictic pronoun takəə ‘that’. The exact distribution between
these forms regard further investigation.(17) a. tənə takəə i-čü-ŋ,        ŋamtü-čə      ŋəðu-tɨ-Ɂ.

              ChND, 2008Personal pronouns can also serve as direct objects, but unlike to other Samo-
yedic languages, they not have inflected forms. Presently, the accusative and the
genitive forms are identical to the nominative form. Older speakers still tend to
use the former suffixes, especially in the accusative case (-m), however there are
only very few examples for this phenomenon. In the speech of younger speaker
the inflected forms never appear. Sentence (18a) illustrates a personal pronoun
in object position with the accusative suffix, while sentences (18b–c) depict a
personal pronoun without the case marker.(18) a. mənə-m kəmə-ŋəə=u.

statement.","[287, 288]"
"  2.1     Attribution
  The following examples show that adjectives in predicate position do not
  require a copula, but the non-verbal part of the predicate carries verbal per-
  son marking. Sentences (27a–b) show agreement marking on an adjective: in
  person and number.  (27) a. mənə təɁ         məŋkə-ə-m maa-mə             kuniɁi͡a

tive auxiliary, but only with the particle ńintuu (more details on negation see

There is no morphological and syntactical difference between proper inclusion
and equation. As the following sentences show, the nominal predicate takes the
verbal endings of the subjective conjugation, cf. (31c–d). Nominal categories
with a possessive suffix cannot take a predicative suffix when used as a predi-
cate. In such sentences, the subject must appear overtly and the nominal cat-
egory only receives the possessive suffix. Furthermore, the personal pronoun
in its possessive function must also appear in the sentence. In past and future
sentences, the copula takes the tense marker.(31) a. mənə ŋəndi͡aiɁ tənə         ďesɨ-rə.

plements, the adjectives do not necessarily agree with the head, i.e. the verbal
suffix does not appear on the attributive adjectives. Sentences in which there is
agreement, like the following example, are rare, they appear mostly in elicited
materials as in (32b).(32) a. mənə hirəgəə-m, ŋondalkaɁa-m, końďutaɁa-m basusʲi-m.

              JSM_090809_Life.238A personal pronoun can also function as the predicate of a sentence. In this
case, there is no copula in the sentence and personal suffixes are also not
attached to the pronoun. The sentence is formed by simple juxtaposition. If
the sentence is in the past or the future, the copula must be used as this takes
the tense marker, (34c).

tures of the pronominal predicate.(35) a. … komənsəj tənə sɨlɨ-ŋ.

              ChND_99_Shaman_flkd.020Similar to attribution, in negated sentences the negative particle ńintuu is
present. For more on the negation of these kinds of sentences see Chapter 12.","[368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"

1        CoordinationIn general, there are three types of coordination: conjunctive, adversative and
disjunctive. Generally, conjunctive coordinated clauses are simply juxtaposed
without any coordinator element (asyndetic coordination); however, there are
some borrowed conjunctions as well. As discussed in Chapter 3, Section 12.1 the
Russian loan conjunction i ‘and’ and the Nganasan word ŋonəə ‘and, again, fur-
thermore’ can also be used as conjunctive conjunctions (monosyndetic coor-
dination). However, it must be pointed out that both elements appear in this
function only extremely rarely. The borrowed Russian coordinator is used only
at the clause level, not at the phrase level. Sentences (1a–b) show coordinated
sentences without any coordinators. For the conjunction-like usage of ŋonǝǝ
see the examples in Chapter 3. Coordinated sentences with i ‘and’ are shown
in examples (2a–b) below. As sentence (1a) illustrates multiple coordination is
also possible.© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_014

tion. This adverb can take the possessive suffix which refers to the subject of

remains without any possessive suffix (3a). It must be noted that in most cases
in the examples given, this adverb does not function as conjunction, but rather
as a temporal adverb. This strategy is used also in Enets and Nenets. The form of

"6.3.3      Negative Supine
This form arise through attaching the marker -mUNKəCTə (-muŋkətə, -mɨŋkətə,

(see Section 6.1.2.1 in Chapter 16) and the elative suffix (-KǝCTǝ): ńijku-muŋgətə
‘in order not to sweat’, büü-müŋkətətə ‘in order that you will not go’, ďorələ-
muŋkətə ‘in order that s/he will not start to cry’. The agent is again marked by a
possessive suffix from the oblique series following the marker. As we have above
seen, negative supine can be expressed by the supine form of the negative aux-
iliary. The two constructions are synonymous. The negative supine form is only
sporadically attested in texts.(88) a. ǝi, kǝrɨɁǝ-tu             ńolhǝðu-muŋkǝtǝ-tu

All Northern Samoyedic languages have a temporal-conditional nominalized
forms.5 Two types of temporal-conditional converb exist: one refers to condi-
tion in the present; the other one refers to the future. Both are formed from the
S1 stem of the verb. Additionally, there is a periphrastic construction composed
of the present conditional form of the BE-verb and the future or past form of
the lexical verb: təi-sʲüə i-hüɁ ‘if it was/existed’, mi-sʲiə ihüɁ ‘if s/he gave’, ńilɨ-ďiə
i-hüɁ ‘if s/he will live’. The markers are presented in chart (89) below:

              JDH_00_TwoDolganBrothers_flk.087A special use of the conditional forms is when it appears in sentences mean-
ing “it is good to …, s/he must …” (debitive-necessitative usage). In this case,
the predicate of the sentence is the adjective ńaagǝǝ ‘good’, while the subject is
the nominalized verb form. If the agent is dropped, the possessive suffix refer-
ring to the agent apears obligatorily on the nominalized form, as in (91a). In
other cases this is not obligatory. If the agent is pronominal, the possessive suf-
fix appears as in sentences (91b) and (92), but if the agent is expressed by a
noun, the possessive suffix never occur, but the noun takes the genitive.

The connegative form appears together with negative auxiliaries and with the

negative marker -Ɂ is attached to the S2 stem of the verb. It is worth noting that
the imp.2sg in the subjective conjugation is formally the same as the connega-
tive form, thus they are morphologically homonymous. The connegative form
of the copula (isʲa) is irregular: ŋuə-Ɂ.(94) a. sɨtɨ ńi-sʲiə              ńaagəə ŋuə-Ɂ.

In earlier descriptions, this category was treated as a mood. However, in Nga-
nasan this category is clearly not verbal, but nominal, and it can be adverbial as
well.6 Both forms are used to express that the speaker’s information is not first-
hand, but he wants to indicate that, the information is from a sensory source,
thus this category can express a non-visual evidentiality. In this chapter only
the structure of the auditive/sensitive constructions are described. For more
detail about its usage see Section 3 in Chapter 6.
   The structure of the adverbial phrase is: NP-nom + Verb-aud. The audi-
tive/sensitive marker -mUnəɁ (-munəɁ, -mɨnəɁ) is attached to the S1 stem of
the verb. The usage of this form is illustrated by the following two sentences.(95) a. ŋua-ntuŋ            bəndi-ni-ə                    kəi-tə

         ‘The (ringing) bells came (close to them).’
                MVL_080304_TwoMeryde_flk.305The nominal structure is constructed up as follows: NP in genitive + the S1 stem
of the verb + mUnUj (-munuj, -mɨnɨj) + possessive suffix. Those forms of the
possessive suffix are used that attach to oblique cases. The -mUnUj suffix can
attach only to verbal stems. The suffix refers to the subject of the structure, and
its usage is compulsory even if the subject is overtly present in the sentence.","[288, 289, 290, 291, 292]"
"2.4      A Short Typological Overview
Like other Uralic languages, Nganasan is a typical agglutinative language. How-
ever, many morphemes consist of more than one morphological meaning.
Thus, the language displays a series of flectional features because several mor-
phemes are cumulative. (For nominal and verbal inflection see Chapters 4 and
5). Some morphemes (suffixes or clitic-like morphemes) are equivalent to lex-
ical items in European languages. (For this morphemes see Chapter 16). Pre-
fixation is absent. Nganasan grammar reflects many characteristics typical of
the Uralic languages, but also some unique features, cf. morphophonological
alternations (see in Chapter 3, Sections 7.1 and 7.3) etc.
   The open word classes are verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. These
classes can be distinguished by morphologic, syntactic and semantic criteria,
however adjectives are not clearly distinguished from nouns. There is a set of
relator nouns mostly with the locational semantics that take special (archaic)
markers of the Lative, Locative and Elative cases (See in Section 6 of Chapter 3).
   Nouns are inflected for number, case and possession. They can appear in
seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, lative-dative, locative-instru-
mental, ablative-elative and prolative) and three numbers (singular, dual and
plural). Possessive suffixes convey possessive meaning; indicating the person
and number of the possessor as well as the person and number of the possessed
introduction                                                                    19entity. Additionally, there is a category typical for the Northern Samoyedic lan-
guages, the (pre)destinative (see Section 5 in Chapter 4). Noun phrases display
the determiner and head constituent order. Possessive pronouns are missing.
   The verbs have three conjugation types (subjective, objective and reflexive).
They agree with the subject in person and number and can agree with the ob-
ject in number as well. Contrary to many other Uralic languages, there are three
morphologically expressed future tenses (general future, immediate future and
future-in-the-past). Additionally, Nganasan has two past tenses (past and plu-
perfect). Verbal stems are classified into two aspectual classes: they are either
imperfective or perfective. Depending on the aspect value, imperfective verbs
describe a present situation in the present tense (aorist), past situation in the
past tense, while perfective verbs denote the immediate past situation in the
present tense (aorist) and remote past situation in the past tense (cf. Section 4.2
in Chapter 5). Additionally to indicative, there are 11 morhologically expressed
verbal moods (imperative, admonitive, optative, interrogative, inferential, re-
portative, irrealis, necessitative, abessive, dubitative, speculative). Mood and
tense markers cannot be combined. Verb can be modified by a large number of
Aktiosart and modal suffixes as well (see Chapter 16).
   As in many other Uralic languages, standard negation is expressed by a nega-
tive auxiliary, which is followed by the so called connegative form of the lexical
verb. For negating of constituent a negative particle is used (cf. Chapter 12).
Predicate possession sentences belongs to the existential type, thus the pred-
icate verb is a special existential verb. However, opposed to the majority of
Uralic languages, possession can be expressed by a transitive verb as well. (For
possessive clauses see Section 4 in Chapter 9).
   Nganasan is a head-final language and has a non-rigid SOV word order. The
word order in a sentence is motivated by the information structure (cf. Chap-
ter 14). Determiners (inclusive possessors) are always left-branching. Accord-
ing to Holmberg’s classification, Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language
(Holmberg 2005, 2010), in which both, the pronominal subject and in cer-
tain circumstances the pronominal object can be omitted in a sentence. The
pronominal object of a sentence is only expressed overtly, if it receives extra
emphasis or if it is in a topic position (see Section 2.1 in Chapter 14). There is
no differential object marking, however the direct object of an imperative sen-
tences can appear in the nominative.
   Subordinate clauses are built with non-finite verb forms: participles or nom-
inalized forms, which preserve the argument structure of the base verb. The
use of conjunctions is not typical. Coordination is expressed by the simple
parataxis. Nganasan, like other Samoyedic languages, expresses definiteness
not through articles, but by other means, e.g. with possessive suffixes or word
20                                                                                      chapter 1order. (For more on the characteristics of the typology of Samoyedic languages,
see among others Bakró-Nagy 2012, 2006, Hajdú 1985 and Tauli 1963.)2.5       Orthography
2.5.1         Nganasan as a Written Language
The first official orthography was created by the Samoyedologist Natalya M. Te-
reshchenko in 1986, but the alphabet was inconsistent and the system has
never been widely used. In 1989, a committee (consisting of A.A. Barbolina,
A.A. Momdye, A.Ch. Momdye, E.A. Helimski) was set up in Dudinka to elim-
inate inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the Tereschenko system. The final
version of the orthography appeared in 1992. The alphabet employs all the
graphemes of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet and the following additional char-
acters: i, ÿ, ə, ң, Ɂ or ″, the last two symbols represent the glottal stop. The con-
sonant /ð/ is marked by the symbol ⟨δ⟩, but it is often replaced by the Cyrillic
⟨з⟩ or the symbol ⟨ʒ⟩ for typographical reasons.
   In sum, the alphabet consists of the following characters:     Ɂ (”), ə, a, б, г, д, δ (з, ʒ), е, ё (ѳ), и, i, й, к, л, м, н, ӈ, o, п, р, с, т, у, ÿ (Ү ), х, ч,
     ы, э, ю, яThe parenthesized letters can be used for technical reasons, to replace the
preceding character. Although this is the official alphabet, its use is not com-
pulsory. The usage of characters depends on the author and the editor of a
publication, mainly based on typographic considerations.
   Furthermore, loanwords may contain any of the following letters: в, ж, з, ф,
ц, ш, щ, ъ, ь
1. The writing principles—as well as the characters—are adopted from Rus-
      sian. This means that a palatalized or palatal consonant does not have a
      separate grapheme as in the phonological Latin script (e.g. ń [ɲ] versus
      n), but the palatality of the consonant is marked by the choice of the fol-
      lowing vowel character: an “iotated” vowel (и, ё, я, ю) instead of ы, о, а, у
      respectively, e. g. немы [ɲemɨ] ‘mother’, десы [ɉesɨ] ‘father’.
2. Long vowels are marked by doubling the vowel letter: маа [maː] ‘what’. If
      there is a palatal consonant preceding the long vowel, the long vowel is
      marked by a sequence of an iotated vowel and its non-iotated pair: няа
      [ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’. Vowel pairs are as follows: я—а, ю—ÿ, и—i, ё—о.
3. The letter ⟨i⟩ is only used after non-palatal consonants. The grapheme for
      a long i [iː] is ⟨iu⟩: miu [tiː] ‘the two of you’.
4. There is no separate symbol to denote the diphthongs [i͡a] and [u͡a] in the
      Cyrillic alphabet, these are marked by the letter sequences ⟨ua⟩ and ⟨ ya⟩,
introduction                                                                                              21     respectively. The diphthong [i͡a] is often marked by the Cyrillic letter ⟨я⟩,
     e. g. хяӈ [hi͡aŋ] ‘palm’.
5.   The rare vowel sequences /ia/, /üa/ are written as follows:
     Latin script Cyrillic script Examples     ia                  ea or иа                диа or rarely деа [ɉia] ‘brain’
     üa                  ёа, юа or ѳа            дюату, дёату or дѳату [ɉyatu] ‘s/he dis-
                                                 turbs’
6.   The assimilation of vowels is often marked in Cyrillic writing. For exam-
     ple, the traditional буəзу ‘word’ [buoðu] form is replaced by буозу.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"3.1.3      Posteriority
Posteriority (before X happens, Y happens) is expressed through the abessive
participle -məTUmA1Ɂa. In this construction, the imperfective action noun
-NTU form of the existential verb (isʲa: iču) follows the participle form of the
main verb. The subject/agent can be expressed by a possessive suffix from the
oblique series following the lative suffix on the nominalized form of the BE-
verb as in sentence (23a) or it is an NP in genitive, which takes the position
before the abessive participle as in sentence (23b). In this latter case, the nom-
inalized form of the BE-verb does not take the possessive suffix.(23) a. {ŋənsu-mətɨmɨɁɨ͡a i-ču-tə-nə}                 Ibula

Purposive clauses describe the purpose for the action mentioned in the clause.
These sentences are formally not complex. They can be expressed in several
ways. Primarily, supine structures are used (cf. Section 6.3 in Chapter 5). Usu-
ally, the subject of the purposive clause is the same as the subject of the matrix
clause, but seldom structures appear with different subjects as well as in (26b).
The matrix clause normally precedes the supine clause, but a reverse order is
also possible (26c).
   The subject of the supine clause is marked by a possessive suffix of the
oblique series on the nominalized form as in (26a) or by NPs in the genitive
as in (26b). If there is no reference to a subject in the sentence, the predicate
refers to a general subject.
   The most often used purposive adverbial clauses are marked by the supine
-NA2Kə followed by a possessive suffix. The nominalized form holds the argu-
ment structure of the verb. If the subject of the matrix clause and the subject
of the purposive clause are different, the subject in the purposive clause takes
the lative marker as in (26c).(26) a. lʲansə-ðɨ-nʲə                    lətɨ-guə-m

              ChND_041212_Girl_flkd.171In the other purposive construction, the speaker uses the nominalized verbal
form with the supine marker -ɁsA2 (-Ɂsa, -Ɂsi͡a), which is followed by a posses-
sive suffix of the oblique series. The possessive suffix refers to the subject of
the construction. This construction is not very common. The purposive clause
is sentence-final, as sentences (27a–b) show.(27) a. bənsə mɨəðə-səbtə           kondu-Ɂ             kobtu͡a-mə,

              KES_080721_Disease_flkd.310With verbs of moving, the purposive clause is expressed by a simple infinitive
form. This structure can appear only with the same-subject. The infinitive nor-
mally precedes the finite verb form, but in some cases, it can follow the inflected
verb.

              ASS_161024_Life_nar.015Negative purposive meaning is built with the help of the negative supine
marker -mUŋgətə. In this structure, the subject is also marked by the posses-
sive suffix. The use of the negative supine is rare. Instead of a negative supine
marker, the speakers mostly use the supine form of the negative auxiliary as
(29b) shows. The two constructions are fully synonymous. The same speaker
can use both structures.(29) a. ďa-ðə-tu                  konɨ-ni͡agə-ŋuðu-tu          ńüu əhɨ

              MACh_940808_DogLake_flkd.023As has been seen above, juxtaposition is the overt method to link the main and
purposive clauses, although under Russian influence some people have begun
to use the Russian linking element štobɨ ‘in order’. It must be noted that this
kind of construction does not copy the Russian structure, only the linking ele-
ment appears in the Nganasan sentence, in the purposive clause the verb still
takes the supine ending.

Reason (or causal) clauses clarify why the described action or event happens.
There are two types of reason adverbial clause, although it must be stated that
this kind of sentences are very rare in the corpus. On the one hand, the matrix
and subordinate clauses can be linked without any conjunctions. In this case,
the verb of the subordinate clause appears in its infinitive form as in sentence
(31a). The predicate of the subordinate clause can as well be a non-verbal, as in
sentence (31b).(31) a. … ŋuəlɨ      kojmusa-Ɂa-ku-m-suəďəə-gümü

              ChND_080722_TwoFriends_flk.156On the other hand, two clauses can be linked together with a subordinator
as well. The conjunction suəbəsɨ ‘because’ and the grammaticalized phrase
təniɁi͡ajsʲa [təniɁi͡a ‘so’ + isʲa ‘be-inf’] with the meaning ‘for this reason’ can
mark the subordinated clause. The subordinator təniɁi͡ajsʲa always appears in
the matrix clause, with the subordinator (32), while the conjunction suəbəsɨ
introduces the subordinated clause (33).

A manner clause has the function of manner adverbs. These are formed with
the infinitive form of the main verb. It usually expresses simultaneous action
in time with the main clause as in the following sentences. The infinitive in
the manner clause retains its argument as in (34a) below. Normally, the man-
ner clause takes the sentence initial or finale position, but rarely it can be
embedded as well, as in sentence (34a) in which the sentential subject precedes
the manner clause. Occasionally, manner clauses have an additional temporal
meaning as well.(34) a. təti ńuə, {tahari͡aiɁ təndə-j      ŋamtə-j      kačəmə-sa}, məlʲi

tive relation. In this case, the nominalized form precedes the finite verb of the
matrix clause. This structure expresses anteriority, if the action noun takes the

ture cannot be considered as Russian influence.

           PKK_71_OneTent_flkd.0343.6      Conditional Clause
Conditional sentences express hypothetical situations or implications. Accord-
ing to the degree of conditionality, there are two basic types of conditional
sentences. In the first type, both the main clause (matrix clause) and the sub-
clause express conditionality (double conditional: hypothetical or counterfac-
tual conditional). In the second sentence type, only the sub-clause is condi-
tional (simple conditional), the main clause does not express conditionality.
Conditional meaning can be expressed by a converb (nominalized verbal form:
-HÜɁ or -HÜɁnÜ) or through the irrealis mood (see Section 5.8 in Chapter 5).
In what follows, an overview of the simple conditional sentences is given with
a description of complex structure thereafter.","[460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467]"

The imperative form for third person (jussive) refers to a wish expressed from
the speaker to the third person. The mood marker is -ŋəə in subjective and
objective conjugation for one or two objects, while -ŋəi is used for the objective
conjugation for more objects and the reflexive-medial conjugation followed by
common personal ending. The following sentences show the usage of these
forms.(44) a. tə čii-ŋəə              maa-ləmu.

Admonitive can express doubt (when the intonation expresses interrogation),
additionally, it is used to state an opinion or even a polite imperative and it can
express a warning as well. The marker is attached to the S1 stem. For the sub-
jective and objective conjugation (referring to one or two objects) the marker
is -CKəə, while in the reflexive conjugation and in the objective conjugation
referring to more than two objects is -CKəi. The mood marker is followed by
the common personal suffixes. As the sentences below depict, this mood is typ-
ically used in the second person singular.(45) a. təndə      bikaa-Ɂku       kuńďi ma-lə        mej-kəə-ŋ.

Optative is used in all conjugation types, but it can refer only to the aorist tense.
Table 5.9 shows the mood markers, while sentences (46a–b) are examples with
verbs in the optative.

The interrogative mood is employed for both question types: constituent and
yes-no questions. If there is no verb in the sentence—as in the sentences
below—, the only marker indicating the interrogative mood is intonation: a
rise-fall tone. (For interrogative sentences see Section 2.2 in Chapter 10.)(47) əmtɨ maa sǝnǝ hu͡aa.

             KNT_940903_WildAnimals_flkd.298In interrogative sentences that contain a verb, the verb must be affixed with
the marker for the interrogative mood, which has a separate form for the past,
4 In all sentences, it is the subjective conjugation of optative that cooccurs with the negative
  auxiliary instead of the reflexive form.

         the S1 stem. The interrogative cannot be combined with the common tense
         marker; however, in the future forms, the imperfective suffix -NTə appears as
         a tense marker. The past tense forms and the iterative forms are portmanteau
         morphemes. Personal suffixes of the indicative mood follow the interrogative
         marker.
            Interrogative aorist forms with the mood marker -ŋU are used to reference
         present-time. It can express that the action has finished recently and it has an
         impact on the present state of affairs. If the verb is imperfective, or the verb is
         a motion verb or speech act verb, the aorist interrogative refers to the present.         (48) a. tahari͡ai kurəďi-məənɨ mɨŋ-gümü-nə         mɨ-ŋɨ-m.

         used not very frequently. It form can be used with all persons and all conjuga-
         tion types and it appears, if the action has an iterative feature in the present.
         Earlier studies do not mention it. The form was first described by Gusev (2005:
         19–20).

This kind of use of negated sentences is not only common in Nganasan, but in
other Northern Samoyedic languages as well. The only difference is that neither
Nenets nor Enets use the interrogative form, but change the word order, while
in Nganasan the word order is common as the following sentences show.(52) ńorsu, tənə ńi-bɨ-ŋ            koi-rɨ-Ɂ.

The inferential mood can denote evidential meaning: if the speaker does not
witness the event or action s/he is speaking about, but the circumstances sug-
gest the event is taking place and the speaker is fairly certain that the event
took place, the inferential form is used. This mood, however, is more frequently
used to express an admirative meaning: surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony or
sarcasm. The marker of this mood is attached to the S1 stem. The inferential has
only one temporal form, the aorist and two mood markers, one for subjective
and objective conjugations for one or two objects, and another for reflexive and
objective conjugations for more than two objects. Table 5.11 exhibits the mood
markers.
   The following example shows the usage of the inferential mood expressing
evidentiality.

tions expressed by this mood lack the interrogative marker. The following sen-
tence is an example of a question and expresses surprise.(54) əbəj, kobtu͡a nənsu-Ɂi-ðə                munu-ntu: maaďa

             TNK_940903_KehyLuu_flkd.176The inferential can be expressed by an analytic structure: a participle form of
the main verb is accompanied by the regularly conjugated copula in the infer-
ential mood. If the present participle of the main verb is used, the meaning
of the sentence has a present reference. Past meaning can be expressed by
the past participle form of the main verb, followed by the conjugated copula
in the inferential mood. This structure is a non-verbal predication, which is
presented in Chapter 9, Section 2 below. The following sentences display this
structure.

              KNT_940903_KehyLuu_flkd.132It must be noted, however that there is a fine semantic difference between the
two constructions. The inferential form ńilɨbi͡aðɨŋ of the verb ńilɨ- ‘live’ means
‘it seems, you live’, but the participial form ńilɨ-tɨə-ŋ i-hu͡aðu-ŋ means ‘it seems,

"7.1       Exclamative
The exclamative clitics -əɨ, -əu, -uɁ attach to vowel final and consonant final
stems in different ways: it follows vowel-final stems, e.g. barusʲi-əi ‘hey, witch’,
but it is inserted before the stem-final consonant, as in ďujkələ-Ɂ > ďujkəl-əu-Ɂ
‘screw it in please!’; konɨ-gu-ðəm ‘let me go’ > konɨ-gu-ð-əu-m ‘let me go finally!’.
The suffix vowels are pronounced long and there is a rise-fall intonation con-
tour on the morpheme. As the sentences below demonstrate, it can attach to
540                                                                    chapter 16all word categories; however, it occurs most frequently with nouns. Example
sentences suggest that suffix harmony is not applied in all cases. The clitic
expresses the exclamative meaning, but it can mark unexpected information
too, thus, it has a mirative usage as well. In this case, it conveys surprise, as in
sentence (54).(54) a. tə, … barusʲi-əi, ŋonəi-Ɂ         basaď-əu-Ɂ.

              TKF_031117_ThreeBrothers_flk.1407.2       Suffix -ŋUTU
The suffix has a meaning ‘finally, definitely, well’. As determined by suffix alter-
nation and gradation rules, the forms of this clitic are -ŋɨtɨ, -ŋutu, -ŋɨðɨ or
-ŋuðu. When attached to a nominal category, this emphatic clitic appears after
the derivational suffixes and possessive morphemes, but before the number
marker, e.g. ńaagəə ‘good’ > ńagəə-ŋutu ‘definitely good’; tibɨjki͡aɁku ‘little boy’
> tɨbɨjki͡a-Ɂku-ŋutu [boy-dim-def] ‘a definitely little boy’; ŋoj ‘leg’ > ŋoj-mə-
ŋutu [leg-1sgposs-def] ‘definitely my leg’. To observe the relative positioning
of possessive and number markers, compare sentences (55a–b).(55) a. təti-rə         tahari͡a kura      konə munu-munu-ču:

Tis morphemes occurs very frequently and most often attaches to nominal
categories or infinitives. It has the meaning ‘all right’ and it, e.g. bɨɁ ‘water’ >
bɨküə ‘water all right’, ŋomtǝďa ‘sit down’ > ŋomtǝ-güǝ-ďa, ‘all right sit down’

or case suffix as sentence (58b) demonstrates. When attached to a verbal stem,
inflections, mood markers, and the aorist marker for imperfective verbs fol-
low it, as in ďüŋar-küə-tü-Ɂ ‘they are noisy’; helɨðɨ-küə-tə-ndɨ-m ‘I am willing
to help you/him/her’. However, the aorist marker for perfective verbs precedes
this clitic, as in sentence (58d). The pre-infinitival position may signal that it has
reached such a stage of grammaticalization that it can be considered a deriva-
tional suffix.(58) a. ŋomtə-güə-ďa,          ŋomtə-bаðа-Ɂ,

              MVL_080304_TwoMeryde_flk.2227.5      Suffix -KüCmü ‘but, well, as you know’
This is a frequently occurring morpheme which is generally attached to nom-
inal categories before the possessive or case suffix, but occasionally it appears
on verbs after derivational suffixes or before the infinitive suffix. This suffix can
attach to the special pronominal stems as well (cf. Section 4.1.4, in Chapter 3).
If the suffix attaches to the nominal stem, derivational suffixes can precede
it. Examples: ďeŋkuj ‘trap’ > ďeŋguj-kümü-mə ‘well my trap’; maðə-Ɂə ‘big tent’
[aug] > maðə-Ɂə-gümü ‘well big tent’. Sentences (60a–b) show the suffix used
with a nominal stem, while sentence (61) is an example of a verbal stem.(60) a. kaði͡au, əmtɨ kuhu-gümü-mə                  ńiə-bi-nə

When attached to a nominal category, the emphatic clitic-like suffix -ŋalə
(-ŋi͡alǝ) appears before the destinative and possessive suffix and has an em-
phatic meaning ‘even’, cf. sentence (62a). This suffix precedes the case endings
and number marking suffixes. This means that, based on how it behaves mor-
phologically, this morpheme is closer to being a derivational morpheme than
to a clitics.(62) a. tahari͡a kurəgu-ndiɁ    ŋanuə-mənɨ hunsəə

              KVB_97_SonOfAPriest_flks.104At the same time, when it is attached to a verb stem, it is usually placed between
the perfective aorist marker and the person marker, as sentence (63a) shows,
but precedes the imperfective aorist marker (63b). The common tense and
mood markers such as past or future follow the suffix -ŋalə (63c). But there
are also examples where it is followed by a derivational suffix. Sentence (63b)
demonstrates a case in which the iterative derivational suffix is placed follow-
ing -ŋalə, while in sentence (63a) the resultative suffix precedes it. The example
sentences show that in this sense there is no vacillation in this respect: the itera-
tive suffix always occurs after the clitic-like morpheme in every case, regardless
of the speaker.(63) a. četu͡a ǝrǝkǝrǝ-mǝnɨ ńiibta-Ɂa-mi, ŋǝmǝ-Ɂki-Ɂǝ-ŋalǝ-mi.

This suffix is prominently used as an emphasizing element in negative sen-
tences, though it alone does not express negation. It sometimes occurs in affir-
mative sentences, but only very rarely, and when it is the case, it only has an
emphasizing role (64b). This morpheme can be preceded by other clitic-like
morphemes and derivational suffixes and is followed by inflectional suffixes.(64) a. təti kəi-mənɨ-ntɨ               hеðɨtɨ-sɨ, mаа mənə ŋuɁəð-ə

pheme is attached to the lexical verb, followed by the connegative form, as in

aorist markers precede it (65a), but all tense and mood markers follow it (65c).

present as the event took place, but he can infer what happened based on visual
evidence or inference. If this inference is made based upon visual evidence, this
means that he sees the result of the event. The following sentence pair shows an
example for this usage. In both sentences the inferential mood is used, which
can be used with all persons.(1) a. təə təti təmuŋka-ku munu-ntu: əbə ńorsu maaďa

                      KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.029       In sentences (1a–b) the verb must be marked with the inferential, because the
       mouse did not see that the woman threw the moss out and left the board there,
       but he sees them lying on the tundra. Thus, his conclusion is that the moss and
       the board have been abandoned. As mentioned in Section 5.8 in Chapter 5, the
       inferential mood can be used in interrogative sentences without an interroga-
       tive marker, as in sentences (1a–b) above.
          An additional and not rare usage of inferential is to emphasize a new ele-
       ment (admirative meaning). The following pair of sentences show that the
       speaker indicates the source of the information only once. In sentence (2a) the
       speaker uses the inferential, which means that somebody should have come. In
       sentence (2b) there is no more need to use the inferential, because the speaker
       has already expressed the source of the information.       (2) a. ou, kaŋgü-čə-küə-nu         tahari͡aiɁ

              ChND_061025_Haljmira_flks.185The inferential form may have an overtone of speculation and frequently ex-
presses surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony, or sarcasm. Example (3a) is a state-
ment, thus the verb is in the indicative, while in (3b) the speaker expresses their
surprise, thus the verb remains in the inferential.(3) a. ńük=əu-Ɂ      əməniə bələuka-ŋku-ruɁ          ləŋu-Ɂi-ðə.

              KES_04_Accident_nar.007The speculative mood can have an inferential meaning as well, when the
speaker makes an inference based on evidence (4b). In the following sentence,
the speaker does not see the guest, but he draws this conclusion, because he
sees the sledges around the tents. Sentence (4a) introduces the situation.

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.351Inferential meaning can be expressed by the verb ńantɨďi ‘seem’ as well. This
verb is imperfective and cannot take a tense marker. Conveying this meaning
with the mood marker is also not common, there are only interrogative forms
attested. In most cases, this verb appears in the 3sg form, but there are very
few examples in which the verb agrees with the subject, as in sentence (5b)
below.(5) a. bana-Ɂa-m            ńandɨ-tɨ.

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.161The predicate in sentence (5b) is non-verbal (poor and miserable), the use of
the verb ńantɨďi is copula-like. It must be stressed however that the BE-verb can
appear in the copula position as well. However, in the latter case, the reading of
the sentence is not evidential. The examples demonstrate that, if the speaker
references momentary evidence, he uses the verb ńantɨďi, but if the statement
is general, the speaker uses the inferential form of the BE-verb. In sentence (6)

are unable to hunt.(6) əiɁ, nəŋhu͡ə ŋanuə nagür ďaməða-ŋku            i-hu͡aðu.

           KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.017The verb ńantɨďi is typically used for quotations, as in sentence (7). (For more
about the usage of this verb and of the inferential mood, see Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.) In the quoted clause, the negative auxiliary does not take
the inferential suffix, but the 3sg form of the verb ńantɨďi appears as a parti-
cle.(7) tahari͡aa əməniə sʲüamu-mə,        Dʼüðɨmi͡aku sʲüamu-mə

           KES_031115_Paris_nar_1942       Reported EvidentialityAs was mentioned in Section 5.7 in Chapter 5, the reportative mood marks
second-hand information, meaning the speaker heard about the action or
event from a secondary source, as in sentences (8) and (9) below. In sentence
(8) the speaker was present during the event, but she was only a new-born baby
and thus, she heard about this event only from someone else’s narration, as she
cannot remember it. Sentences (9a–b) depict a quotation. The speaker narrates
what the girl said to him.(8) tə, təti ini-Ɂi͡a       munu-baŋhu, ńemɨ-nə

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.478The speaker may refer to the narration of a certain person, but reportative can
also be used to speak about events that are generally spoken about in the com-
munity. This mood is very often used, if a story is told about a certain person. In
this case, the feeling of reality is enhanced by the usage of the mood. It must be
noted, however, that tales and myths are told in the indicative and not in repor-
tative mood. In a folklore text, the reportative mood appears, if the story teller
reports anything or the information comes from a specific person (see sentence
8 above). During shamanic ceremonies, the shaman reports the information
heard from gods in the renarrative to those present. Normally, the information
source is not specified, but in some cases the specific person can be expressed.
In this case, the reportative form semantically expresses the quotative, as in
sentence (10).(10) tǝtі-rǝ       tahari͡a ǝmnɨ helɨ-Ɂ munu-ŋkǝ-ndu-Ɂ tǝti-rǝ

     ‘Where are you going (they ask)?’
           KES-SEN_031114_Dialog_conv.005Also, the interrogative-reportative is used, if the person being asked is sure to
know the answer.

if the question is in the interrogative-reportative. The interrogative-reportative
cannot be used in indicative sentences. If the speaker asks the question again
to express an echo-question, the interrogative-reportative is also used.(15) čaj ďaŋguj-hu͡aŋhu. – čaj ďaŋguj-hu͡a?

            TKF, 19993        Sensory EvidentialityThe auditive/sensitive forms are used when talking about events that the speak-
er has heard or has felt in some way, thus the evidence is based on auditory or
sensory evidence. There are two auditory/sensory markers (cf. Section 6.6, in
Chapter 5). In present day Nganasan there is no difference between the usages
of the two forms. It seems, however, that the adverbial form (-mUnǝɁ) is more
ancient and is presently only seldom used. The usage of the adverbial structure
is extremely rare, only 1% of all auditive forms have this form, but it was found
in recorded productions from 5 different speakers.
    Auditive/sensitive forms can be used in interrogative sentences, in which the
interrogative marker is missing. Only the presence of the question word marks
the interrogative. In the examples below, the adverbial auditive is used.(16) a. tahari͡abǝ ban-a-Ɂku-kǝi-čü         logi͡aɁ-mɨnǝɁ bǝnti-ni.

              KVB_97_SonOfAPriest_flks.044If the nominalized form (-mUnUj) is used, it takes the possessive suffix to mark
the experiencer, however, it can refer only to an experiencer expressed by a per-
sonal pronoun. If it lexically appears in the sentence, it stays in nominative (17)
or in genitive (18a), but it shows agreement in number. and the auditive form
obligatory takes the possessive suffix.(17) tahari͡aa ŋonəə     ba-mi          logi͡a-mɨnɨ-či.

           TKF_041210_NenetsManAndGiant_flkd.017Auditive can also be used, if the speaker has seen and heard the event, but the
sounds have played a more important role for him than what was seen. Very
often, verbs expressing sound effects—like munuďa ‘say’, munsa ‘say’, sojbusa
‘sound’, hɨrkuðəsa ‘say loudly’, laŋəɁkəsa ‘cry out’—are in the auditive form,
even if the speaker can see the person who produces the sound.(18) a. təni-ðə       tahari͡aa hɨrkuðə-munu-ču           maaŋuna

         chapter 7Verbal Valence and Valence-Changing OperationsThis chapter describes the basic valence pattern of non-derived (basic) verbs,
and deals with valence-changing operations. In the first section the verbal
valence is presented and classified according to the argument structure. In
Section 2 the productive valence changing processes of passivization and tran-
sitivization are shown.","[294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"
"4.1     Existential Possessives
The copula təisʲa ‘exist’ is used in existential possessive sentences. The pos-
sessed NP, which is the grammatical subject of the clause, normally takes a
possessive suffix that agrees in person and number with the possessor. The
pronominal possessor does not obligatory appear in the sentence, because the
possessive suffix refers to it. Sentence (46) shows a possessive sentence without
a pronominal possessor, while sentence (47) contains a pronominal possessor
and the possessed entity is marked by a possessive suffix. The possessive con-
struction can be modified with quantifiers, as in the examples (46) and (48b)
below. The word order is always (possessor)-possessee-verb, if the possessor is
present in the sentence.(46)                                     possessee possessor       tahari͡aa tɨminі͡a četə sɨr            kobtaɁa-mə       təi-ču.

not obligatorily appear on the possessed entity, as in (48a–b).(48) a. ŋanuə sʲigiɁə.

              ChND_99_Fire_flkd.0024.2      Transitive Construction
A transitive verb honsɨ ‘have’ can also express a possessive relation. In these
constructions, the possessor is the grammatical subject and the possessed NP,
the direct object of the sentence and as such, appears in the accusative. The
verb must agree with the subject, i.e. the possessor, in number and person.
The possessor can be omitted from the sentence as in sentence (50), since the
personal verbal ending already refers to person. Thus, if the possessor can be
referred to by a pronoun, it is usually not overt in the sentence. (This is a pro-
drop phenomenon in a possessive construction.) The possessed does not have
to take on a possessive personal ending.

possessor or the possessed. During the elicitation, speakers produce both con-
structions and declare them fully synonymous and interchangeable. It should
be noted, however, that in spontaneous texts (both narrative and folklore) the
existential construction is more frequent.(51) a. mənə təi-ču           ańikaɁa kümaa-mə.

              JSM_080212_ Relationship2_flkd.059On the other hand, the present participle of the verb honsɨ is also frequent in
spontaneous texts, as in sentences (52a–b). As can be seen in this example, the
participial form of the have-verb is in the predicate position, so the construc-
tion structurally is a non-verbal predicate.

              MVL_09ß007_Hungabtadja_flks.671The verb ŋuðasa ‘own’ also expresses possession. This verb can be used to
express an inalienable possessive relation. The relation between the possessor
and the possessed is stable in time and the possessor controls the relation, i.e.
[+stable time] and [+control] features can be associated with this relation. The
possessor functions as the subject, while the possessed is the direct object in
the accusative. This structure emphasizes the existence of the possessive rela-
tion. Such sentences are considerably rarer than the previous type; there is only
one example for this construction in the corpus. The following two sentences
show the usage of this verb.(53) a. mənə səďəə-mtɨɁ         ŋuða-tu-m.

         chapter 10Simple SentencesSentences are generally grouped into two categories according to the way in
which the relationship to the predicate is expressed namely: simple or com-
plex sentences. This chapter deals with simple sentences.
   The syntax of Nganasan has not been thoroughly explored. There are only
few works that have dealt with syntactic problems. In her monographic work
dedicated to the syntax of Samoyedic languages (1973), Tereschenko only enu-
merates the types of sentences which exist. In a grammar of Nganasan by the
same author (1979), semantic and syntactic issues are not considered at all. The
summary below highlights and discusses the most important questions, but it
is not an exhaustive account.
   Nganasan is a head-final SOV language; however, head-finality is not rigid.
Word order is basically determined by the information structure of the sen-
tence (for more detail see in Chapter 14). Head-finality is obligatory in phrases
containing a noun, such as possessive phrases (head: noun) and postpositional
phrases (head: postposition). Contrarily, in attributive phrases the adjective
can follow the head noun (cf. Section 1 in Chapter 8). Question words tend to
appear at the beginning of the sentence, but they sometimes occur in a more
internal position (see Section 2.2.2 below).
   The most important grammatical relations are easily discovered in a sen-
tence, as these are morphologically marked. An overt subject is not a com-
pulsory element of a sentence; according to Holmberg’s terminology (2005)
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language. There are no general pronouns
(like one in English or si in Italian) in Nganasan.
   Nganasan is an accusative-nominative language, as the unmarked element
in an active sentence is the subject and the agent. However, the object may be
unmarked as well, if it is in a third person pronoun as the inflectional suffixes
can refer to a third person object. Thus Nganasan in not only a subject pro-
drop, but also an object pro-drop language. The personal pronouns have the
same form in the role of an object and subject. (For information about the flex-
ion of personal pronouns see Section 4.1 in Chapter 3, for object marking see
Section 1.2 below).

cial emphasis on case marking. The subject and the object can be indentified

the speaker does not understand why it would not happen. Thus this form can
express astonishment as well. If the speaker want to express a statement, the
common negative construction must be used (52c).(52) a. mɨŋ-hi͡alə-nə           ńakəlʲi-Ɂə-Ɂ

"3.1       Existential Clause
Of the Samoyedic languages, Nganasan offers the widest range of possibilities
concerning which existential sentences can be formed, namely, with or with-
out copulas. In the existential constructions both existential copulas are used.
One is used to express existence in a place, thus this kind of sentences normally
has a locative (coda), while the other is used to express abstract existence or to
make a general statement. In the latter case, as can be seen below, a locative
element never occurs in the sentence.
    The existential verb təisʲa ‘exist, be’ appears most often in existential clauses.
It is just as frequent in possessive constructions, but—as described in Section
4.1 below—these two constructions resemble each other in other respects as
well. This verb can take tense markers, so it can be used in past and future
as well, as in sentence (36b) below. The word order in sentences is coda–

tion is used to express existence in a place.(36) a.               coda        pivot     copula

                 PED_041206_MyLife_nar.11The existential verb tənijsʲa ‘exist, be there’ is used less frequently than təisʲa.
The existent data indicates that this construction can be used only in sentences
expressing a general statement or abstract existence.(37) a. ŋunɨrɨ-Ɂɨa              ma-Ɂa      tənіj-hu͡aŋhu.

the coda is expressed, it takes the first position, thus the word order is coda—

word order is the same as in existential sentences, but in which the BE verb
(isʲa) is used, rather than one of the two existential verbs, as in (39).(39) təndə      ma-tənu ŋuə-lʲaa tɨbɨjki͡a i-ču.

     ‘In the tent there’s only a boy.’
           KNT_940903_KehyLuu.011Copulaless existential sentences are far less frequent than those with a copula.
As shown in the following example, these sentences can be formed without a
verb form of any kind. This kind of construction appears in tales as one of the
introductory sentences.(40) təndə     kuəďə ńi-ni             ŋuɁəj maɁ.
     this.gen hill.gen on-adv.loc one tent
     ‘On this hill (there is) a tent.’
           JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.004The constituent order in this kind of existential sentences is coda—pivot.
This, of course, does not allow for any speculations as to where the copula
would be, if there were one. This structure is probably used due to Russian influ-
ence. As for existential clauses in Russian, the word order is coda–(copula)–
pivot. The emergence of a parallel structure underpins the suggestion that
word order changes due to the influence of Russian. In any case, it must be
noted that this way of forming existential sentences is far less frequent than
the two other types presented above, and it only appears in narrative texts.
   The pivot of existential sentences can be modified with numerals (number
determiners), number marking (in case of Nganasan, the plural and the dual)
and with quantifiers. Sentence (41a) below shows that a numeral can modify a
pivot without making it definite. The same is true for number marking, illus-
trated in (41b).(41) a. təndə     ma-tənu četə-ri͡aa ŋanaɁsa təi-ču.

In a locative sentence, the existential verb introduced above (tǝisʲa) can occur,
but regularly it is the BE-verb (isʲa). In locative clauses, the word order is
pivot—coda—copula, but in elicited sentences pivot—copula—coda
was also accepted and used by native speakers, although in texts it appears less
frequently. Sentence (42) is an example with the verb isʲa ‘be’, while in sentence
(43) the speaker uses the existential verb tǝisʲa. In this sentence, the location is
not specifically mentioned.(42)        pivot                                     coda     copula

            KTD_NN_SeuMelangana_flks.1149In a locative sentence the pivot must be definite. Demonstratives express def-
initeness, as in sentence (42) above the demonstrative təti ‘that’ specifies the
pivot. Possessive suffixes can express a real possessive relation as well, and
make the entity definite, as in sentence (43) the 2nd person possessive suffix
-rə which attaches to the word ‘sledge’. A noun may also lack explicit marking.
In that case, the pivot does not carry any possessive suffix nor is it preceded by
a demonstrative pronoun; the interpretation of the pivot as [+definite] is only
based on word order and the choice of the copula. The following sentences
show such unmarked noun phrases in the pivot role. Both pivot–coda–
copula and pivot–copula–coda order can be used, however the copula
coda word order is not common in the corpus, but it appears in elicited data. It
is probably a Russian influence. Indeed, in a locative sentence, the pivot always
precedes the coda.

           ChND, 2008If the pivot is expressed by a pronoun and the coda is expressed by an adverb
or question word, no copula is obligatory in aorist tense, as the adverb can take
verbal suffixes, as sentence (45a) shows, however the use the copula is most
common. In sentence (45b), the pivot is covert, the speakers use the copula
and the adverb does not take the personal ending. In past and future tense, the
copula is obligatory and it carries the tense marker.(45) a. mənə tamnu-m.

              ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.072Summing up, it can be stated that the inflection of the pivot element (theme)
and the word order play a crucial role in deciding what interpretation a sen-
tence is assigned. Existential and locational sentences are differences in word
order: while locational sentences characteristically display the order pivot

"2.5.2       Writing System in This Volume
Instead of the above described Cyrillic script, in this book, a phonological tran-
scription based on the letters of the Latin alphabet will be used. I mainly follow
the transcription principles of Helimski (1994a: 9–12), but my transcription is
slightly modified. I distinguish palatal and palatalized consonants. The follow-
ing letters are used:     Ɂ, ə, a, b, g, ď, d, ð, e, h, i, i͡a, ɨ, j, k, lʲ, l, m, n, ń, ŋ, o, r, s, sʲ, t, (ť) č, u, u͡a, üForeign words may also contain the graphemes: z, f, p, c, š.
   The phonological transcription in this book is based on the following prin-
ciples.
1. Each phoneme is marked by one grapheme and each grapheme corre-
      sponds to one phoneme.
2. Vowel length is marked by doubling the vowel letter: ńaa [ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’.
3. I do not mark the assimilation of vowels to each other: məu ‘earth’ and
      not *mou or *moo [moː]. The only exception is when a root ending in -a
      is followed by an ending that starts with a sequence -Ɂə (e.g. the augmen-
      tative suffix or the aorist marker). The assimilation of schwa is marked in
      writing: konaɁa ‘s/he went’ [konaɁa] or [konaː] and not *konaɁə.
4. The regressive assimilation of consonants (right to left palatalization) is
      marked in writing: bəńďəɁ ‘all [pl]’ [beɲɉeɁ] and not *bənďəɁ.
5. The letter ⟨e⟩ is only used in the first syllable of words. All syllables fol-
      lowing it have schwa instead of an ⟨e⟩: sʲejmɨčə ‘your eyes [acc]’ and not
      *sʲejmɨče.
22                                                                            chapter 16.   The sounds denoted by ť [c] and č [t͡ʃ ] occur in free variation in the lan-
     guage, thus either of them can be used in writing. In this volume, usually
     ⟨č⟩ is used.

3       Language Data3.1      Overview of Previous Works
The first attestations of the Nganasan language are relatively late. The first
word list, which sporadically contains some Nganasan material was compiled
by the English travelling merchant Richard James in 1618–1620. However, in
his notes James does not explicitly mention the Nganasans. Daniel Gottlieb
Messerschmidt (1685–1735) was the first to document words in the 18th cen-
tury. Not earlier than a century later, in 1823, this material was made avail-
able to the public in the work Asia Polyglotta by Julius Klapproth (1783–1835).
Also, a few Nganasan words can be found in the book Das Nord-Ostliche Theil
von Europa und Asia (1730) by the Swedish officer Philipp Johann Strahlen-
berg, who collected data from different languages during his time in exile in
Siberia. This work includes a comparative word list in which the words of the
languages are compared to corresponding lexemes of among others, the Hun-
garian language. Gerhard Friedrich Müller (1705–1783), the German scientist,
who led a scientific group on the second (great) Kamchatka expedition (1733–
1743) also collected, among historical and geographical materials, word lists and
24                                                                       chapter 1a few sentences from several Siberian languages including Nganasan. These
materials, except for the geographical and historical parts of his works, are
unfortunately still unpublished (see Helimski 2001). The polyglot vocabulary
Linguarum totius orbis vocabularia comparativa (1786–1789) compiled by Peter
Simon Pallas also includes some relevant language data. Word lists of different
length and comparative tables are included in his itineraries (1776). Pallas had
also used Müllers materials. All these data cannot or, only in a limited manner,
be used for linguistic analysis.
    The first systematic data collection was performed by the Finnish scholar
Matthias Alexander Castrén (1813–1852), the first prominent scholar of Samoye-
dology. Castrén made conducted expeditions among the Uralic peoples and
started investigating Samoyedic languages in 1842. His third field trip lasted
from 1845 to 1849. Although he spent only a few weeks on the Taimyr Penin-
sula, the Nganasan and Enets language material he collected during this time
is appreciated as an important milestone in the research of both languages. In
1849, health problems forced him to leave Siberia. Once home, he started sys-
tematizing the material collected, but his early death impeded the completion
of his work. His manuscripts were edited by Anton Schiefner. The work entitled
Nordische Reisen und Forschungen von M.A. Castrén appeared between 1853 and
1862 in 12 volumes. It includes a grammar of Samoyedic languages (1854) and
a Samoyedic vocabulary (1855). Schiefner has simplified the notation applied
in the manuscript and often refrained from indicating dialectal differences.
Nevertheless, the work is one of the most important sources in Samoyedol-
ogy.
    Castrén’s merit is highlighted by the fact that, for a long time, no progress has
been made in the studies on Nganasan. From the time after the Russian revo-
lution, only the short grammar by G.N. Prokofjev, published in 1937 is worth
mentioning. This grammar however does not represent substantial advance-
ment as it partly relies on the data discussed by Castrén.
    One of the most prominent researchers in the second half of the 20th cen-
tury was Natalya M. Tereshchenko (1908–1987), who was also an expert on the
two other Northern Samoyedic languages, Nenets and Enets. Tereshchenko’s
first noteworthy studies on the Nganasan language were published in the 1960s
(e.g. Tereshchenko 1966). Her monographic description from 1979 represents a
culmination and synthesis of her oeuvre. However, the fact that it completely
lacks a syntactic description represents a limitation of the monograph. This
also partly holds true for the phonological description.
    Between 1968 and 1972, several scholars from the Duľson School from Tomsk
have carried out fieldwork among the Nganasans and collected grammatical
data, word lists, and texts. Part of these texts were published in the series Skazki
introduction                                                                           25Narodov Severa (Tales of the Peoples of North Siberia, 1976, 1980, 1981), but a
good portion of these materials still have yet to be analysed and published.
   The Hungarian scholar Tibor Mikola (1936–2000) was the first to provide
modern linguistic descriptions based on his work with a speaker of Nganasan
in Leningrad in 1968. A very short grammatical sketch attached to the texts col-
lected was published in 1970.
   Substantial contributions to the study of the Nganasan language were made
by Eugen Helimski (1950–2007), whose work represents an important mile-
stone in modern studies. One of Helimski’s most significant achievements
was the description of the system of complex morphophonological rules such
as: syllabic gradation, rhythmical gradation, nunnation, and vowel harmony
(Helimski 1994a, 1995, 1998). This was an essential contribution to the descrip-
tion of the language, as the above-mentioned phenomena had only been briefly
dealt with in the previous literature.
   Even though several additional texts have been published since the publica-
tions of texts by Mikola, there is still little published text material available in
Nganasan. The collections edited by Kazis Labanauskas (1942–2002), who lived
in Dudinka for several decades are also noteworthy (1992, 2001). Labanauskas’
latest text collection (2001) was translated into German by Michael Katzsch-
mann. Based on these texts, Katzschmann compiled a grammatical description
of Nganasan (2008).
   The practical Nganasan-Russian-Nganasan dictionary, compiled by T. Ju.
Zhdanova with the help of two native speakers Nadezhda T. Kosterkina (1952–
2005) and Aleksander Ch. Momde (1945–2001), deserves special mention. This
difficult to access dictionary is a useful tool for language learners since it pro-
vides word base variants as well as additional morphophonological informa-
tion.
   In the 1980s, research on grammar intensified. Ekaterina Boľdt deals in her
monograph with nominal derivation (1989). Wagner-Nagy in her monograph
investigated word-formation in general (2001), and she compiled a text book
and short grammatical description in 2002, in which some essential point of
phonology, morphology and syntax were raised.
   Syntax is a less well investigated area; there are hardly any monographic
descriptions in this field. After Tereshchenko’s monograph on Samoyedic syn-
tax (1973) only the work of Kovalenko (1992) dealt with syntax.
   Recently Nganasan language corpora with interlinear glosses have also been
made available via the internet.77 In the project Typology of Negation in Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic languages (acronym: NOS,
  2008–2011) conducted at the University of Vienna two texts (of 583 sentences altogether)
26                                                                                 chapter 13.2       Language Data for This Study
In this grammar, fieldwork materials are analysed which were collected dur-
ing several field trips between 1937 and 2016. The transcripts are part of the
Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC), which has been created as part of
the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan project (supported by the
German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1) whose primary goal is to generate a dig-
ital, searchable corpus of spoken Nganasan. During fieldwork sessions, at least
two types of language data are collected: (1) elicited sentences aiming to clar-
ify grammatical or lexicological questions, (2) texts and songs. My fieldwork
materials, which are part of the corpus, consists of data collected during four
fieldwork trips, carried out in 1994, 1996, 2008, and 2016. Altogether, I spent four
months in Usť-Avam, and in Dudinka as well as working with language consul-
tants in Moscow.
   The grammatical description in this volume is based on language data from
the Avam dialect. It relies on existing grammatical descriptions (e.g. Teresh-
chenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.), language data derived from fieldwork
text collections, and elicited data. For illustrating grammatical phenomena, I
prefer to provide sentences from the collected texts over elicited sentences.
Syntactical and pragmatic phenomena can only seldom be demonstrated using
elicited sentences. As concerns these data, I assume a considerable Russian
influence (especially in the case of word order), which is a limitation of these
data. However, there are certain phenomena in the corpus data which proved
to be of little or no use. In this case, I use elicited data. The examples are pro-
vided with glosses and English translations. The glosses will be presented using
a slightly modified version of the Leipzig Glossing Rules (LGR).","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

           ChNS_080302_Wife_nar.011It has been seen in Section 3.3 in Chapter 5 that it is possible to refer to an object
with the reflexive conjugation. Nganasan does not use reflexive pronouns, but
in sentence (18a) below, the reflexive suffix is bound by the phonetically not
realized pronoun sɨtɨ, which is marked with (pro) in the sentence. If there are

pronouns cannot be the same (18b). In this case, the reflexive conjugation is
not used.(18) a. ďalɨ-ə ŋəməkətu ńerənɨ (pro) ńobtə-mɨmba-ta-Ɂ.

              KNT, 19942.2      Possessive Markers in Referential Function
It is a well-known phenomenon that the Samoyedic languages use possessive
suffixes in non-possessive functions (cf. Nikolaeva 2003, Siegl 2015, Zayzon 2015
etc.). Some of the possessive suffix have a referentiality function. This use is
similar to the definite article, however it cannot be stated that the posses-
sive suffixes are grammaticalized articles. The reason is that definiteness in
Samoyedic languages can be expressed with other means as well.
    The 2sg and 3sg possessive suffixes are often used in a referential function.
There are two central heroes in example (19), the mouse and the reindeer. In
sentence (19a) the mouse is not marked, but it is definite. In sentence (19c) the
main participant is the reindeer, which was introduced by sentence (19b), this
sentence is a semantic correction to (19a). Thus, the 3sg possessive suffix on
the word ‘reindeer’ in sentence (19c) is used as a linking element (anaphoric) to
the referent, which was mentioned in the previous sentence. The same referent
appears in sentence (19d), but in this sentence, it is marked by the 2sg suffix.
The switch from 3sg to 2sg is a common strategy in folklore text to mark topic
continuity, but it appears in narrative texts as well. In sentence (19g) the mouse
is also marked by 2sgposs. This participant was not mentioned lexically in the
previous sentences, but from the situation the hearer can identify it, because it
was introduced by sentence (19a).(19) a. təmuŋku kočə-ðu-Ɂki-Ɂə.

              TKF_990816_Lemming_flkd.066The referential use of the 2sg possessive suffix is possible, if the marked NP
functions as subject of the sentence (19d), however it never occurs in another
argument position. The marker may combine with proper nouns and can also
be found on a determined noun phrase with a demonstrative təti ‘that, this’. It
must be stated that there are no examples with the other demonstrative (əmtɨ
‘this’) in this context.(20) a. hu͡aa     kora-Ɂa      təti DʲaiɁkü-rə   mɨɨ-Ɂə.

              PED_061023_MyAunt_nar.069As Zayzon pointed out (2015: 270), in the object position the 3sg marker is used
more often than the 2sg possessive marker. If in the sentence, both arguments,
the subject and the object are topicalized, the subject topic takes the 2sg suffix
and the object the 3sg as in (19g) above and in (21) below. However, it must be
mentioned that in most cases the 3sg often express true possessivity as well.(21) tə, DʲaiɁkü-rə         imiďi-mti                  ńolhə-ða-Ɂa

           MVL_080225_Djajku_flkd.041The 3sg possessive marker can be used, if the referent is not mentioned in
the previous sentences, but the speaker can reconstruct it from the discourse
(associative anaphoric use). In sentence (22b) the door is marked by the pos-
466                                                                   chapter 14sessive suffix, but it was not mentioned earlier. However, the anchor for it can
be reconstructed.(22) a. ‘In the morning, they went hunting again … After a few days they come
        back, they kill wild reindeer.’ [MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.006–008]      b. tahari͡aa kaŋkə-güə hi-ntənɨ hii ďalɨ-ďa ŋua-ðu

         ‘After one night, in the morning, the door opened.’
              MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.009As mentioned above, the 3sg is used, if the referent is mentioned in a previous
sentence (see sentences (19b–c) above). If the referent is not in the previous
clause, but it was introduced earlier, the 3sg can also be used (23b).(23) a. ‘It turns out that Dyaiku has a sister. Let us bring away the girl! …’

              PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.147The first person possessive marker also appears in an associative anaphoric
function. In the following sentences, the 1sg marker is used. First the trap is
marked with it. The trap was introduced, but this sentence states that the trap
belongs to the ogre. Thus, it marks a true possessive relation. In sentence (24b)
it marks the fox. It would be possible to introduce the fox without any posses-
sive marker. In this case, the fox can be any fox. In this text, the narrator first
introduced one of the main characters of the text. After introducing the ogre,
the second protagonist, the polar fox is introduced and it is marked by the 1sg.
They two are the central heroes of the texts.(24) a. sʲigiɁə munu-ntu: ou, hiəməu, tahari͡aa ńaagəə tə, əmtɨ mənə

names can be also marked with first person possessive suffixes. In the follow-
ing sentences the friend of the narrator is introduced without any markers. Two
sentences later, the same referent is marked by the possessive suffix. This exer-
cises a direct anchoring function.(25) a. KuəɁmaɁku təi-sʲüə         sʲüar-mə.

               ChND_061023_School_nar.0123        Direct and Indirect SpeechThis section examines the describing of direct and quoted speech. Normally,
there are three participants in a speech event, the original speaker, the reporter,
and the listener. It is characteristic for folklore as well as for narrative texts that
the speakers extensively use quoted speech. However, Nganasan does not have
any quotative marker (complementizer or quotative particle), thus all quoted
speech is canonical direct speech and represents the words of the original
speaker. Quoted speech is typically introduced by an utterance predicate with
the meaning ‘say’, ‘tell’ or ‘think’. The following chart displays the speech act
verbs.
468                                                                   chapter 14(26) munuďa            ‘say’

     kirtusa           ‘shout, cry’
     ŋuma-             ‘whisper’The most often used verb is munuďa ‘say’, which often appears with the verb
sɨnərɨrsɨ ‘think’. This verb functions as a modifying adverbial. The speech act
verbs allow short or long quotation in postverbal position (see examples be-
low).
   The sentences below portray the use of the speech act verbs. In the exam-
ples, the reporter (the current speaker, CS) is not mentioned. The reporter lends
his voice to the original speaker (OS); thus, the reported speech is reflected
from the point of view of the original speaker in respect to tense, person, and
other deictic elements. The listener appears in sentences (27b–c). The original
speaker of the speech event is the speaker of the original speech act, as the ogre
in (27a) or ‘I’ in (27b). In sentence (27c) the original speaker is not overt, only
the verbal ending indicates it.(27) a. sʲigiɁə-tu      munu-ntu: ou, maaŋuna təti ŋonüməə

              KECh_080224_Idol_nar.013Quotations can be considered as complement clauses. As the sentences show
the complement-taking clause is followed by a quoted clause. The latter is not
introduced by a complementizer. Occasionally, the Russian complementizer
čto ‘what/that’ is also used. This is clearly Russian influence. In this case, not
only the complementizer is borrowed, but also the structure. Thus, there is per-

folklore texts, but in personal narratives is common, when the current speaker
is a participant of the utterance. In this sentence, the reporter (the current
speaker) speaks about herself in second person. (She is the participant of the
group that travels to France.)
   In reported speech, the reportative mood can also be rarely used. In this
structure, the original speaker is not obligatory mentioned in the utterance, but
can be clearly identified from the situation and from previous sentences. In the
example (30b) the current speaker is mentioned in the previous sentences.(30) a. ‘Where is your girl, what did she say? She threw away my bag and said
        that she didn’t need someone, who is so poor.’

         chapter 15LexiconNo considerable synchronic research has been done on Nganasan vocabulary.
The Nganasan lexicon has only been studied for etymological and historical
purposes. Some word lists were published (for example Castrén 1855, Kortt–
Simchenko 1985 etc.), but the majority of these lists are typically attached to
texts (cf. Mikola 1970, Wagner-Nagy 2002, Katzschmann 2008). Therefore, these
word lists only contain forms appearing in the text under consideration, and
consequently only the usage and forms therein described. This creates a lim-
ited description of the usage of the lexemes. In sum, there are some studies
on Nganasan lexicography, but no work on Nganasan lexicology is available.
Consequently, synchronic lexicological research except of very few works (cf.
Brykina & Gusev 2015) practically does not exist. The studies published in this
field have been incidental and primarily serve the purposes of historical lin-
guistic and etymological research.
   Therefore, the publication of the first Russian–Nganasan, Nganasan–Rus-
sian students’ dictionary (Kosterkina et al. 2001) of approximately 4,000 entries
accompanied by a multimedia dictionary1 is of primary importance. The mean-
ing of the lexemes therein provided are more precise and detailed than in the
previous word lists.
   This chapter summarizes and arranges data from previously published stud-
ies (listed above). Furthermore, based on data collected during fieldworks (in
1994, 1996, 2008, and 2016), new information is also provided. Traditionally, the
structuralized lexical categories are kinship terms, names of months, names of
body parts, colour terms etc. This chapter primarily discusses the basic seman-
tic domains. The fields in which data collection proved to be deficient (such
as the parts of a sledge) are omitted here. A list of plant and animal names,
however, is provided and some additional categories are also analyzed. Entries
are arranged into smaller thematic groups inside a larger semantic field. Larger
categories (body parts, names of plants and animals etc.) are not commented
on, only word lists are provided while for other terms (colour terms, months),
some background information is provided.

present tense form. The first person forms are also not attested.
         chapter 6EvidentialityThis chapter discusses the possibilities for expressing evidentiality. Within
this grammar, evidentiality is considered a semantic-functional domain, which
encodes the source of information or evidence (i.e. knowledge) about which
the speaker is speaking. Nganasan contains both a grammatically marked ver-
bal category as well as lexical expressions of evidentiality. The lexical items are
mostly particles or grammaticalized verbal forms, and they express not only
evidentiality, but also have epistemic meaning. These epistemic meanings are
not described in this chapter (for examples of lexically expressed evidentiality
see Section 8.2 in Chapter 3). Here, the focus is only on the grammatical cat-
egories of evidentiality. However, in some cases examples are given for lexical
evidentiality as well. Table 6.1 summarizes the possibilities for the encoding of
evidentiality.
   According to Aikhenvald (2004), Nganasan has a three-part evidential sys-
tem, in which the non-visual sensory (auditive/sensitive), inferential, and re-
portative categories are distinguished. It must be noted that the direct visual
sensation is unmarked. In the following sections, the evidentiality categories
are described semantically.","[292, 293, 294]"
"2.1.1.1     Passive Sentences with Passivized Verb
The passive suffix can attach to perfective and imperfective transitive verbs as
well as to perfective and imperfective intransitive verbs. If the verb takes the
passive derivational suffix -RU, it can only take the suffixes of the subjective
(20d) or reflexive conjugation (20a–b–c). The usage with reflexive conjugation
is the most common one. Passivization of transitive verbs forms a personal pas-
sive; while passivization of intransitive verbs produces impersonal construc-
tions (see in Section 2.1.2.3 below). Passive verbs can take mood markers and
further derivational suffixes (cf. sentences (21) and (22) below); they have a
gerundial as well as a connegative form. The following sentences illustrate the
inflectional structure of a passive verb.

fixes, such as habituative (20b) and inferential (20c); furthermore, it can be
turned into a noun or a participle via derivational suffixation. The participle
form of the passivized verb forms a kind of passive NP (one kind of relative
clause), as in sentence (22) below. This structure is not used very often. (For
relative clause, see Section 4 in Chapter 13).(21) ďürаkа-Ɂi-čə              təndə sʲaðɨ-Ɂə-Ɂ,    ďüraki-Ɂ        tə

           KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0162.1.1.2     With Passive Participle
Another way of forming passive sentences is the usage of passive participles
(-mǝǝ). The participle can appear in an attribute as well as in a predicate posi-
tion. If the passive participle takes the predicate position, the predicate of the
sentence is non-verbal, thus it shows agreement with the subject in number
and person. These constructions describe events when a constant state (result
of the preceding action) is arrived at. The described property is an imma-
nent property of the subject. The grammatical subject of the sentence is the
theme/patient. This structure is like resultative structures in that here, the
action produces a result. The participle cannot carry tense or mood markers.
The tense relation or mood appears on the copula verb, as in sentence (24a–b).(24) a. hoðür hotə-məə                 i-sʲüǝ       ďirǝktǝrǝ ďa

              JDH_00_Fosterling_flkd.050If the passive participle takes the attribute position, it forms, from a typological

  4.1.3        Comparative Forms of Personal Pronouns
  If in an equality sentence the compared entity is referred to by a pronoun, it is
  expressed by a derived form of the postposition na ‘to, towards’ or with mantə
  ‘like, similar’. If the construction is formed with the postposition na, the simila-
  tivesuffix (-RəKU) is followed by the nominative form of the possessive suffix
  that refers to the appropriate person. It is, however, the oblique forms of pos-
  sessive personal suffixes that connect to the postposition mantə. Both forms
  are listed in Table 3.1.
      In an equative sentence, the forms with the postposition na and -RəKU can
  appear without the personal pronoun, while the postposition mantǝ is always
  preceded by the pronoun.  (29) a. na-rəgu-mə       ńaa          təɁ.

               PED_080731_Competition_nar.4544.1.4       Special Forms of Personal Pronouns
There are special forms for emphatic personal pronouns. Emphatic clitics can
connect only to these, just like some derivational suffixes. The special stems of
pronouns never appear on their own, only in suffixed form. The stem is followed
by an emphatic suffix (cf. Section 7, in Chapter 16) and the oblique case form of
the possessive suffix. The special stem ends in a -ń consonant, which although
it does not appear overtly, initiates palatalization and nasalization (cf. Section
7.4 in Chapter 2). In third person forms, the special stem has two versions. In
the sections below, which stem is used for the given pronoun form is always
indicated. Table 3.2 shows the special stems and the structure of the personal
pronouns.
    Below is an overview of the forms of personal pronouns derived with the
limitative suffix as well as with the various emphatic suffixes.

Personal pronouns have a limitative form, which is formed from the spe-
cial pronominal stem and the limitative suffix -RA1a (-rɨa, -raa, -lʲia) ‘only’.
The limitative suffix is always followed by the possessive suffix attaching to
oblique cases. In third person, only the sɨń- stem is used. The forms are given
in (31):
(31)            Singular      Dual       Plural       1person mɨ-lʲia-nə mɨ-lʲia-ni mɨ-lʲia-nɨɁ

       3person sɨ-lʲia-tɨ sɨ-lʲia-ti sɨ-lʲia-tɨŋ
These forms are found only in subject position. Their usage is illustrated by the
following sentences.(32) a. mɨ-lʲia-nɨɁ          buə-gə-tu-mɨɁ    ńaaďətə-ďa, …

              KES_031115_Paris_nar.2244.1.6       Personal Pronouns with Emphatic Morphemes
Emphatic pronouns are different from intensifiers (cf. Section 4.3 below) both
in their form and their meaning. Formally they are similar to limitative forms.
The meaning of these forms is rather vague and consequently very difficult
to translate. They cannot be translated by words like ‘himself/herself’ as in
the sentence ‘He himself opened the tin.’, rather a personal pronoun plus an
extra emphatic word or structure can give their meaning in another language.
Emphatic pronouns have several forms. As can be seen the following exam-
ples, more than one emphatic clitic can attach to pronominal stems, but their
ordering is strict, and only some of them—as -sʲiə, -btə, -cčə, -bülʲa, -Küə and
-Kücmü—attach to other emphatic morphemes, whereas the other suffixes
occur only by themselves. The suffixes that can connect with each other can

connect to each other. As can be seen in Figure 3.1, the suffix -KüCmü always
occurs in the position immediately before the possessive suffix.       ⎧ bülja ⎫ ⎧ Küə ⎫

The meaning of this form is ‘it was X and not someone else’ or something like
‘well, anyway’. In third person, only the sɨń- stem is used. In the texts, exam-
ples of only the first and second person forms have been found, meaning that
all third person forms have been elicited from native speakers and checked by
other native speakers. The most frequently occurring forms are the 2sg and
2pl forms (each making up 30% of all forms), followed by the 1sg form (25 %
of the total), although such forms occur only in 0.3 % of all sentences in the
corpus.
    As chart (33) reflects, singular forms do not vary, whereas du and pl forms
have two or more variants in the texts. The i ~ ü alternation is in harmony with
the rules of vowel alternation (see Section 7.7.2 in Chapter 2). The 2du form
ending -ndi and the 2pl form -nt does not conform to the rules of consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1. in Chapter 2.), but they are used.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135]"

1        Word Order and Information StructuringNganasan is a head-final language, thus the statistically most common word
order is SOV, however the complements of the verb including the subject and
object can appear in several permutations. The simple intransitive sentence
contains at least two elements, the subject and the predicate. If the subject
is not emphasized, it is covert. Additionally, sentence adverbials can appear in
the sentence in the left peripheral position (1b) or after the predicate (1c), if any
adverbials appear at all. The following three sentences show a simple intransi-
tive sentence.(1) a. sʲiti numə-naŋku ńuə tu-sʲüə-gəj.

icate, the subject, the object and the predicate. Nganasan being a consistent
pro-drop language, an overt subject is not obligatory in the sentence. The par-
ticipant, which is already etablished in the discourse, if it is not covert, takes the
sentence-initial position. This position is the topic position, thus the default
topic in Nganasan is the syntactic subject of the sentence, the rest of the sen-
tence is the predication itself.
   The topic names the participant of the action/event, while the comment is
a statement on the topic. The topic can be preceded by discourse particle (2a).
The prototypical topic refers to a human [+human] and definite [+def] person.
For this reason, the topic is normally expressed by a proper name (2a), kin-
ship term (2b), personal pronoun (2c), but the topic can be a quantified or a
simple noun phrase (1a–c) as well. In this latter case the topic is less prototyp-
ical.(2) a. təti tahari͡aiɁ KuəɁmaɁku-mə    ďütü-gətə mənə kəmə-ďa,

introduces a new participant in the event (latǝǝ ‘bone’). In the following sen-
tence, this participant became established, thus the topic of the sentence (3b).
Topics are often made definite by possessive suffix without possessive mean-
ing as in (2b), by the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘that, this’ as in (3b) or by
the proximal demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’.(3) a. kəmə-ra-Ɂi-ðə,               ŋuəlɨ  ŋuə-Ɂ lataa-Ɂku-raa.

mation. The bone is an active piece of information mentioned in a previous
sentence, while the woman is the participant of the story, who is re-activated
in this sentence.
   When the introduced topic is already definite, it is possible to make the sec-
ond mention whit a personal pronoun, but in such cases the topic most often is
referred by simple verbal ending. In sentence (4a) the topic is given and active,
thus it is only referred to by a personal ending. The subject of the sentence is
covert. In sentence (4b) the topic is re-activated and expressed by the personal
pronoun.(4) a. ŋansə nənsu-ďi munu-baŋhu ńüə-Ɂkü-tü                         ďa: ńükü

              ChND_061105_Nenets_nar.013Sentence constituents in the topic position can be replaced by the anaphoric
demonstrative təti ‘that’. In this case, the deictic function of the demonstrative
is understood as topic marking and it appears obligatorily after the NP. This
new function is not obligatorily assumed and has not been grammaticalized,
however, in spoken language this usage is very frequent, and in this way the
topicalized sentence constituent is separated from the predicate. The other
demonstrative, əmtɨ ‘this’ never occurs in this function. The construct with a
topic marker is illustrated by the following sentences.(5) a. təti, Ŋińďiľi-mə        təti, Arsʲia   kuə-hu͡a-m-büə

sentence pair shows the ordering of the new and old (or given) information. As
has been described, Nganasan follows so called given-before-new principle. In
sentence (6a) the new information is the tree (muŋku). This participant is the
given information in sentence (6b). This means that the speaker first states the
known element, then the new information is usually given before the verb.(6) a. maaŋuna       muŋku      ŋəði-Ɂə.

immediately before a verb. They often take, though not obligatorily, the sen-
tence-initial position as well. The answer to a question-word question obliga-
torily contains new information, which normally takes the preverbal position.
Question words can be associated pragmatically with the focus. This suggests
that the focus position is before the verb. The following sentence pairs are wh-

Pronouns in subject position are not common. As mentioned above, subject
are often referred to only by a verbal ending, but the proximal demonstrative
əmtɨ ‘this’ and the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’ can stay in the sub-
ject position. Another demonstrative with the meaning ‘this’ (əmə) cannot be
used as a reference marker. It can only remain as a modifier in an NP.
    The demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’ often appears after the overt NP in non-
primary role in the clause. Furthermore, it can be used as a reference marker,
if the primary participant in one of the previous clause surfaces appears as in
(10). In this case, the NP referred to is introduced in the sentences before.(9) taa-čü-guj-čuə-muɁ,                         əmtɨ kunu.

"2.4.1        Transitive and Causative
A transitive verb can be formed from an intransitive verb with a transitive-
causative suffix. In this case, the productive suffix -BTU (-btɨ, -btu) (cf. Sec-
tion 6.3.2.2, in Chapter 16) is to be used. Another, less frequently occurring
transitive-causative forming non-productive suffix is -RU (-ru, -rɨ) (cf. sec-
tion 6.3.2.3, in Chapter 16) on intransitive verbs such as hinsʲi ‘cook’ (intr.) →
hiriďi ‘cook something’. The following sentence pair shows how the argument
structure of the verb is extended by the derivation. Sentence (38a) has a one-
argument intransitive verb, thus it takes only the subject in nominative as its
argument. Note, however that the pronominal subject can be covered in this
case as well. The other participant (ďesɨgǝtǝ ‘from the father’) is optional, thus
this is only an adjunct. The derived verb in sentence (38b) has at least two argu-
ments: the subject (overt or covert) and the direct object.

               JDH_00_Njaakju_flkd.193Causative structures are used, if the sentence expresses that the event was
caused by something or somebody. Nganasan expresses causation by morpho-
logical means, i.e. not with the help of auxiliaries or other verbs. In this case,
the complex causative (factitive) derivational suffix -RUbtU (-rɨbtɨ, -rubtu etc.)
is attached to the transitive verbs. In a causative structure, a new argument, the
causer, appears in the argument structure of the predicate. The causer can be
omitted from the structure, as the inflectional suffix on the verb marks person
and number. An omitted causer is marked by parentheses below. Weather verbs
cannot take a causative suffix. The cause is marked by lative case, compare the
following sentences.(39) a.                                                  patient

               KNT, 1994The above sentences displayed morphological causative, in which a single,
derived verb expresses causation. Lexical causation, i.e. when a suppletive verb
pair expresses causation, is very restricted. Such an example is a verb pair
meaning numəďa ‘wake up’ and kitiďi ‘wake somebody up’. The corpus does
not contain a verb with the stem numəďa and a causative suffix, and the verb
kitiďi grammatically behaves like a numəďa + causative suffix word should. This
is illustrated by the following elicited sentence pair.(40) ńuə numü-Ɂə          → ńemɨ ńuə-mtu

     ‘The child woke up.’ → ‘The mother woke the child up.’
           KNT, 19942.4.2       Detransitivization
Decausative structures arise, when a semantically causative sentence is
changed in such a way that the causer disappears. Typical decausative struc-
tures are formed by medial and perception verbs. In case of medial verbs,
generally, transitive verbs are used medially. There is no derivational difference
between causative–medial verb pairs; they only differ in their inflection prop-
erties (see also Section 3 in Chapter 5). The same verbs in medial usage take
the inflectional suffixes of the reflexive conjugation, while transitive verbs have
two arguments, and take the inflectional suffixes either of the subjective or of
the objective conjugation. The direct object of a transitive verb becomes the
subject of the medial verb. The following sentence pair shows the use of medial-
transitive verbs.(41) kuǝďümu ńuǝ ŋua            təlʲüɁə.   → ŋua təlʲü-Ɂi-ðə.

         chapter 8The Structure of the Noun PhraseThis chapter discusses the structure and the major function of a noun phrase
(NP). The most common noun phrase is comprised of a single noun. Pronouns
can also serve as the head of an NP, but these cannot be modified. Pre-modifiers
can be of the following categories: adjective, demonstratives, indefinites, quan-
tifiers, personal pronoun (serving as a possessive pronoun) numeral, and rela-
tive clauses. The relative clause is discussed in Section 4 of Chapter 13.
    A noun phrase is typically head-final: it is composed of an optional pre-
modifier and a noun head, thus the basic structure of the noun phrase is as
follows: (det)-(num/quant)-(adj)-noun. In some cases, the modifier fol-
lows the head (see Section 1 below).
    The core syntactical functions of the NP is to express the subject or object
in a sentence, but they can be marked denoting various oblique cases and they
occur as well as the argument of postpositions. An NP can serve as a predicate of
a sentence as well. This sentence type is discussed among the non-verbal predi-
cates in Chapter 9, Section 2. In the sections below, NPs are discussed according
to their modifier.","[323, 324, 325, 326, 327]"
"5.8      Necessitative
The necessitative (in earlier descriptions called debitive, cf. Helimski 1998)
expresses that the action must be done, it is compulsory. The postulated marker
-BsUTə is attached to the S1 stem of the verb. The first consonant (-b) of the
suffix drops after consonant-final stems (for the morphophonological rules see
Chapter 2, Section 7.6.2). A similar meaning can also be expressed with a con-
verb construction (cf. Section 6.4 below in this Chapter). Table 5.14 contains
the forms of the necessitative suffix in aorist. This verbal mood is only used in
aorist.
   The following sentence shows the usage of this mood.

           JDH_00_FallenEarth_flkd.038Past meaning is expressed by a complex structure: the participle of the neces-
sitative form (cf. Section 6.2.3 below) of the main verb is accompanied by the
past tense form of the BE-verb. The participle is conjugated predicatively, thus
it takes verbal personal endings. Helimski (1998: 504) describes this structure
as debitive past, thus he considers it as tense. In my opinion, this is not a tem-
poral, but a modal category. This construction is used to describe actions that
must have occurred in the past.(63) təə       čühə-nɨ         mənə basu-suðə-m       i-sʲüə-m.
     that.gen time-adv.loc I        hunt-ptcp.nec-1sg be-pst-1sg
     ‘I had gone to hunt at that moment.’
           ChND, 2016There is an analytical construction for necessitative, which is most often used
instead the verbal mood. The main verb in past tense is accompanied by the
conditional form of the BE-verb. The subject is referred to by the possessive
suffix appearinf after the conditional marker.(64) … əm-kümü čerəsʲini-tə-sɨ        ŋətu-ďüə i-hü-nə.

     ‘… I should try to ride them.’
           MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.2605.10     Abessive
This mood refers to events that could have happened. Similar to the above
moods, this is quite rarely used. The marker is attached to the S1 stem of verbs.
The verb can take the suffixes from the subjective and objective paradigms,
reflexive conjugation is not attested in the corpus, but would theoretically be
possible. Table 5.15 displays the mood markers.

Reflexive
   Sentences (65a–b) show a usage in aorist tense. Past meaning is expressed
by a complex structure: the abessive form of the main verb is accompanied by
the past tense form of the BE-verb, as in sentence (66). The future form is not
attested.(65) a. tuj-sʲa    təti təndɨ-či                 ďebtu-mətumaɁi-čü.

             ChNS_080302_Bear_nar.005Quite frequently, this meaning is expressed with the help of the particle ŋɨɨtə-
‘not yet’ and simple negation. The sentence pair below shows the two ways to
express similar meaning. In sentence (67a) the speaker supposes that the event
verbal inflection                                                                259is going to take place. In this case, the speaker is sure to go hunting soon. In sen-
tence (67b), however, there is no sign of presupposition from the speaker. For
this reason, in this sentence the abessive mood is not used, the verb appears in
indicative. In both cases the speaker is not hunting at the moment.(67) a. mənə ŋɨɨtə-nə                kona-mətumɨɁə-m basu-ďa.

        ‘I do not go to hunt yet.’
              ChND, 20085.11    Dubitative
This mood is applied by the speaker, if s/he intends to express uncertainty,
doubt or surprise. The dubitative marker is attached to the S1 stem and has
the form -LU (-lɨ, -lʲi, -lu, -lʲü). The sentences are often questions without the
interrogative marker present on the verb, as in (68b). The following sentences
show the usage of the dubitative mood.(68) a. kəðə=u ńükü=əu, mənə tolɨmə-lɨ-ŋ            maaďa təniɁi͡aj-ŋu-ŋ.

also appear before the mood marker. The function of this suffix in not clear, but
it cannot use without the mood marker and the sentence obligatory contains
a question word. Further investigation into the meaning of this construction is
required. The following two sentences show the verb form with the two dubita-
tive markers. According the language assistants, this construction cannot have

              JDH_99_ThreeTents_flkd.0655.12     Speculative
The speculative mood is an epistemic mood, expressing the speaker’s assump-
tion that the event might take place in a past with a present time result. This
expresses the meaning ‘it seems’. More rarely it can have a meaning convey-
ing evidentiality. This is described in Chapter 6 below. (See also Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.)
   This mood is also mentioned in descriptions about Enets (Siegl 2013b: 288),
as well as in Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014: 101, she calls it the “approximative”). The
speculative mood is complex, the mood marker consists of a participle present
suffix (-NTUǝ, cf. Section 6.2.1 below) followed by the similative suffix -RǝKU
and the verbal personal endings, as in sentences (70a–b). According to the time
reference of the present participle, this form has a present time reference. In
contrast to Nenets, the past form is complex and it is not built using a past par-
ticiple, but the speculative form of the main verb is accompanied by the past
tense form of the BE-verb, as in (71a–b). The speculative form is documented
not only with personal endings from the subjective conjugation, but with end-
ings of the objective and reflexive conjugations as well, as in (70b) and (71a),
thus this category is a fully grammaticalized form. The future form however, is
not attested.

as participles, converbial forms, infinitives, and supine. Non-finite forms occur
predominantly in dependent context, thus they play an important role in sub-
ordination (see in Chapter 13). Only participles can act as predicates, other
non-finite forms are not conjugated and they are not compatible with mood
and tense suffixes. This section does not deal with nominalized forms, such as
action, place and instrumental nouns. The derivations of these forms are pre-
sented in Chapter 16, Section 6.1.2.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281]"

Not all adverbs of manner are morphologically complex forms, but most often
words in the plural genitive or prolative are used in this function. These cases
are glossed as adv. Although it cannot be determined when one or the other
suffix is used, the two forms are mostly in complementary distribution, that
is, no word can usually be used as a starting point of adverb derivation in two
different ways. The following two sentences illustrate the use of adverbs.

                 JSM_090809_Life_nar.4806       PostpositionThere are no prepositions in this language, Nganasan only uses postpositions.
Postpositions can easily be distinguished from suffixes, as these are indepen-
dent words which do not take part in suffix alternation and can bear stress.
The only exeption is the allative postposition ďa, which has features both of a
postposition and of a case suffix.
   Postpositions are divided into two groups: postpositions with case inflection
(inflectable postpositions) and postpositions without case inflection. Postpo-
sitions with case inflection like adverbs, take special, ancient case endings (see
Section 5 above); they are inflected for local cases. The other set of postposi-
tions lack inflection. Many of the postpositions are of nominal origin (relator
nouns); they are usually etymologically old postpositions.
   Postposition are the head of postpositional phrases, it is composed of a noun
(phrase) in the genitive case and a postposition. The postposition immedi-
ately follows the noun (phrase), particles can be placed between postpositions
and the head. Postpositions cannot be modified, and they never express agree-
ment with their objects. However, they do take possessive suffixes, e.g. ŋilʲənunə
‘under me’, huənuni ‘behind the two of us’. (More about see in Section 4.1.2
above.) Semantically postpositions are relational, spatial, or temporal.","[168, 169, 170, 171]"
"2.1        Singular
Singular is morphologically unmarked, thus has no number marking. If the NP
has a specific referent, the singular form means that there is one of the entities
(11a). If the NP has no specific referent, the singular is used again (11b).(11) a. luu ďübəi-ti        loča-Ɂ        ńini

              KBD_71_Parka_nar.0012.2       Dual
If the speaker is talking about two entities, either the dual form of the noun
or the numeral sʲiti ‘two’ is used, but the latter is normally followed by the sin-
gular form of the noun. Occasionally, the noun takes the dual marker after the
numeral: sʲiti səmu ~ sʲiti səmugəj ~ səmugəj ‘two caps’. (Regarding the agree-
ment between the nominal phrase with a numeral complement and the predi-
cate, see Section 1.1.1 in Chapter 10. The structure of the quantified noun phrase
is described in Section 3, Chapter 8.)
    In discussing paired body parts, the dual is often used (cf. (12) below), how-
ever, in modern texts, occasionally the plural forms occur, as in sentence (14)
below in Section 2.3. The subject and the predicate must agree grammatically.(12)     sʲejmɨ-gəj-čǝ           čilʲi-sʲitə.

         ‘It pecks your eyes out.’
              PKK_71_OneTent_flkd.033A special usage of the dual can be seen when the word meaning ‘mother’ or
‘father’ is used in the dual to mean ‘parents’. Recent sources, however, have
found examples for plural in such cases as well. Example (13a) demonstrates
the case wherein the meaning of the word ‘father’ is extended and takes on
nominal inflection                                                            187the meaning ‘parent’, while example (13b) demonstrates the same for the word
‘mother’. In both cases the words are in the dual form. Examples for the plural
use see in Section 2.3.(13) a. sʲürüďa mɨŋ         ďesɨ-gəj, ďeďi-nɨɁ

The plural typically denotes that there is more than one or a lot of the entity:
baŋ ‘dog’: banəɁ ‘dogs’. Uncountable objects can also have plural forms: kaməɁ
‘bloods = a lot of blood’ (kam ‘blood’). Paired body parts are used in the plural
occasionally as well, as sentence (14) shows.(14) sʲejmɨ-či          tahari͡aa əmɨɁɨ͡a      ŋanuə čaj      ńitəǝ-rəgɨ-Ɂ

           KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.143Some words have a plural form, but refer to singular entities. They usually
denote something that is composed of several elements, for instance, a town
has many houses, and so many houses refer to a town. In such cases the word
referring to entity is pluralized:(15) koruɁ ‘house’: koruðəɁ ‘settlement’ or ‘houses’
     maɁ ‘tent’:    maðəɁ ‘nomad camp’ or ‘tents’
     muŋku ‘tree’: muŋkuɁ ‘forest’ or ‘trees’The plural carries the meaning of associative plural when used for family mem-
bers. If a family member, for instance, the mother is in the plural, this does not
188                                                                              chapter 4mean an actual plural, but the sum total of individuals belonging to the family.
The meaning of this construction is ‘X and other (people) associated with X’.
A similar associative plural function is observable in the case of some objects
(e.g. weapons), where the plural can refer to actual plurality or associative plu-
rality (cf. ďintə ‘bow’: ďindəɁ ‘bows’ or ‘bow and arrows’). Such forms are usually
marked with the possessive suffix which refers to real possession.(16) a. ŋuəlɨ     mənə ńemɨ-ńə              təbtə suəď-ü-kə-ďüə-Ɂ …

                ChNS_080302_Wife_nar.069A unique feature of the plural is that numerals can also be marked with it, the
resulting structure expressing approximateness. However, it needs to be added
that such structures are fairly rare.(17) takəə, ńеru-nі                  ďaðikü, ŋuəðə-Ɂ ďir-ə-Ɂ

             TNH_87_Seven_flks.1503        Case and Its FunctionsThe case system is not very rich. In contrast to the other Northern Samoyedic
languages like Nenets and Enets, there is no essive-translative case.2 The essive-
translative meaning is expressed by a non-finite verbal construction with the
auxiliary verb konɨďi (see Section 4 in Chapter 3 and Szeverényi & Wagner-Nagy
2017a).
   There is a grammaticalization process in which the lative postposition na
(cf. Section 6 in Chapter 3) takes effect and becomes a case suffix with comi-2 For the Enets case system, see Siegl 2013b: 148–166, while the Nenets system is described by
  Nikolaeva 2014: 60–66 and Salminen 1997.
nominal inflection                                                            189tative meaning. Similar to the prolative, in plural, the case marker is attached
to the S3 stem, which is formally the same as the plural genitive form of the
stem without a glottal stop. This fact suggests that the suffix has recently been
formed from a postposition. Its grammaticalization, however, did not occur
long enough ago to consider it as a full member of the case system. As depicted
above, case suffixes are followed by possessive suffixes, unlike postpositions.
Thus, the form with the comitative suffix would be ńuə-na-nə ‘with my child’
[stem+com+1sgposs] and not ńuə-nə-na ‘with my child’, but this structure
is not established. It must be noted, however, that in some speaker’s speech,
the na ending undergoes suffix alternation, and is pronounced ni͡a. This must
be considered as one argument for its status as a case suffix (see sentence 18c
below). The following examples show the usage of this construction. Sentence
(18a) is a sentence without any possessive suffix, while in sentence (18b) the
possessive suffix precedes the comitative marker. It is worth noting that the
comitative ending is only seldom combined with possessive suffixes. In most
cases, if the NP is marked by the possessive suffix the comitative is expressed by
a postpositional phrase with the postposition nanu. Additionally, the sociative
derivational suffix -Csəbtə also expresses comitative. (For comitative construc-
tion see Section 6 in Chapter 8).(18) a. mənə Mari͡a-na sani-r-kə-tu-mi

the preceding vowel is lengthened. Personal suffixes such as possessive suffixes
never take the vocative marker.

           TAM_68_Reindeer_flkd.069The case markers are portmanteau morphemes in the plural, while in dual the
number marker precedes the case suffix, but this paradigm is defective. The
dual paradigms lack locative case markers; these are expressed by locative post-
positions instead (see Section 3.2 below). Only nouns have a full paradigm,
pronouns do not take case suffixes (see Section 4 in Chapter 3 above), while
inflected adjectives occur only in the core grammatical cases, i.e. nominative,
accusative and genitive. If adjectives are used as nouns, they can take all case
suffixes. The following case markers exist:
   (1) grammatical cases (marking syntactic relations) such as nominative,
accusative, and genitive; and (2) oblique (encoding spatial relations) such as
lative/dative, locative/instrumental, elative/ablative, prolative and comitative.
   As has been mentioned already (cf. Section 1 above), nouns have three stems:
S1, S2, and S3. Most nominal case markers are attached to the S1 stem, which
is identical to the nominative form of the noun. The accusative and geni-
tive cases are attached to the S2 stem. Gradation applies to the stem conso-
nant, if the conditions are met, both for consonant-final and in vowel-final
stems. The process is triggered by the trace of a historically present conso-
nant in the accusative (-m) and genitive suffix (-ŋ), which does not appear
overtly in present day Nganasan, as in kəntə ‘sledge’: kəndə [acc or gen], but
the deleted consonant creates an empty slot (see Section 4.4 in Chapter 2).
Consonant-final stems are extended by a -ə linking vowel: kam ‘blood’: kamə
[acc or gen]. The former accusative marker, which is provided in brackets in
the tables below, may appear in old texts or in the speech of elderly speakers,
as in (20).(20) kuniɁi͡a mənə ŋəntu-m ŋusɨ-ŋɨ-m

nouns. The following processes are worth noting. Stem-final alternation ap-
pears in forms with the S2 stem, as in maɁ ‘tent’ and biɁ ‘water’. If the suffix
closes the consonant-final syllable, gradation changes the stem consonant, as

              JSM_090809_Life_nar.0422.3     Biaspectual Verbs
Biaspectual verbs are underived verb stems that can be followed by either of
the two aorist suffixes. One of these suffixes implies that the verb in the aorist
tense has present meaning, while in the other case, the meaning is past, as in
hu͡aŋku-ďa ‘be drunk’: hu͡aŋka-Ɂa-m ‘I have got drunk.’ or hu͡aŋku-tu-m ‘I am
drunk.’
3       Conjugations TypesSimilar to other Northern Samoyedic languages (Nenets and Enets), there are
three conjugation types: subjective, objective and reflexive-medial. Every con-
jugation type has its own set of inflectional endings. Personal suffixes express
the number of the object and so, there are three paradigms in the objective
conjugation, referring to 1) one object 2) two objects 3) more than two objects.
Verbal personal suffixes attach to a verbal stem followed by a tense or mood
marker. The S1 form of this relative stem (absolute stem + tense/mood marker)
is followed by the personal suffix.

relation to the object and on the type of conjugation applicable: intransitive,
intransitive-reflexive, transitive and transitive-reflexive.
   Some intransitive verbs, e.g. nəmtəďa ‘feel, discover’, nəńďisʲi ‘stand’, ďoðürsa
‘walk’, basuďa ‘hunt’, isʲa ‘be’, ńilɨďi ‘be’, can be conjugated only in the subjec-
tive conjugation—objective and reflexive-medial forms are missing from their
paradigm.(13) a. mɨŋ tɨmini͡a koruð-ə-tənu-nuɁ               koru-laa

                JDH_00_TwoDolganBrothers_flk_457Intransitive-reflexive verbs like hiďisʲi ‘laugh’, büüďa ‘go away’, nənsuďi ‘stand
up, stop’, bənuďa ‘get tired’, bəlu͡ačusa ‘get angry’ have both subjective and
reflexive forms. Most of these verbs denote volatile movements of the actor’s
own body: change of place or body position. Additionally, verbs denoting men-
tal actions also belong to the set of medial verbs. These cognitive verbs are gen-
erally non-derived and the reflexive forms are used most often. The following
examples demonstrate that both conjugation types can be used. In sentences
(14a) and (15a) the verbs appear in the reflexive conjugation, while sentences
(14b) and (15b), exhibit the subjective conjugated forms.(14) a. urubaakə-mə           ńakələ-ni͡agə-nə, bəbə-nə          ńi

1        Verbal PredicationThe most common distinction between verbal predicates is their simplicity.
The verbal predicate usually is simple. Complex predicates consist of an aux-
iliary and a lexical verb. There are only few auxiliary verbs, one of these aux-
iliaries is the negation auxiliary, which serves to form standard negation and
appears most often in complex verbal predicates. Other auxiliaries are seman-
tically not empty, but they have an additional, mostly modal meaning. In this
section, only examples for the usage of auxiliary konɨďi ‘go away’ are given. For
a detailed description of auxiliaries see Section 3.3 in Chapter 3, for negation
see Chapter 12.
    The auxiliary verb konɨďi ‘go away’ appears only in essive or resultative-
translative constructions. In these constructions an NP is followed by the infini-
tive form (converb1) of the BE-verb (isʲa) and the conjugated form of the aux-
iliary. Word order variations are not allowed. Contrary to Enets and Nenets,
the infinitive/converb construction wasn’t grammaticalized as the essive case.
This form has word stress of its own, and it never undergoes cliticization. The
following examples show this construction. Not only a noun (1a), but also an
adjective (or participle), a numeral (1c) can appear as the nominal element.
(For a detailed description on essive construction see Szeverényi & Wagner-
Nagy 2017a.)

               KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0631.1         Predicate with Subjective Conjugation
Subjective conjugation applies to all verbs. Some intransitive verbs, as ńilɨďi
‘live’, isʲa ‘be’ can be encoded only with subjective conjugation (cf. Section 3.1
in Chapter 5). Transitive verbs take a subjective suffix only in cases where the
sentence has an overt object as in the following sentence.

          KNT_960825_Djingimjaku_nar.006If the object is an overt first or second person pronoun, the verb appears in a
subjective conjugated form. The pronoun functioning as the object needs not
occur immediately before or after the verb, but mostly they assume this posi-
tion. There are no examples for a pronominal object denoting a human entity
with non-subjective conjugation in the corpus. Sentences (3a–c) contain a sec-
ond person object, while sentences (4a–c), a first-person object.(3) a. ńemɨ-rə           tənə      ŋuča-ŋu    ńi-ŋɨ.

morphologically expressed on the verb (see Section 3.2). If the object is overt,
it can be expressed by a demonstrative referring to the person (5a) or by a
personal pronoun, and the verb remains in the subjective conjugation. Inter-
rogatives also co-occur with verbs that are inflected in subjective conjugation
(5b). (For pronominal object see also Section 1.2.2 in Chapter 10.)(5) a. təti-rə        tahari͡aa bii-Ɂi͡a-gəj,     təndɨ-či

conjugation type (6a–b), only in very few examples the objective conjugation is
found alongside an overt object (6c). Its use depends on the information struc-

              KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.047Thus, we can summarize that if any pronominal direct object appears in the
sentence it is governed by a verb conjugated in subjective conjugation. The
appearance of the nominal direct object does not trigger obligatory the use of
the objective conjugation. (See also Wratil 2013.)1.2        Predicate with Objective Conjugation
As mentioned above, the objective conjugation is only used with the 3rd per-
son object. Only transitive and transitive-reflexive verbs have objective forms,
intransitive verbs cannot take this ending. It is not compulsory to use the objec-
tive conjugation, if there is an object in the sentence. No connection has been
discovered between the definiteness or animacy of the object and the objective
conjugation. The objective conjugation can refer to both animate and inani-
mate entities (see sentences (8b) and (7) below). The use of conjugation types
is determined on the discourse level and not on the sentence level, and can
express i.e. the anaphoric reference to an object mentioned earlier (see below).
Here, some tendencies are described.
    It is compulsory to use the objective conjugation, if the object is ellipted
from the clause or the subordinate clause (cf. sentence (7) below). If the object
appears at the beginning of the sentence and it is not followed immediately
by the verb, the objective verb forms tend to be used. The suffix for objective
conjugation refers back to the object in the previous clause, thus it expresses
anaphoric reference. In sentence (7) the verb hotəguəmə ‘I’ll write it down’
refers to sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ in the preceding clause.

            KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.001In the following pair of sentences the first half of the first sentence (8a) intro-
duces the theme (a reindeer). In the second part of this sentence the theme is
referred to only by the verb ending. In the second sentence (8b) the speaker (old
man) uses the verb in the objective conjugation. The conjugation refers to the
object, which was referred to before the last sentence, thus the information sta-
tus of this referent is given, but actually not active. In the following clause, the
verb (mejŋɨmə) also is in the objective conjugation; this is because it refers to
the act of killing, that is, its reference is not the reindeer, but the action itself. In
the last clause, the objective conjugation of the verb again anaphorically points
to the reindeer.(8) a. sʲelujki͡a-ðɨ             küü-Ɂa,        koða-Ɂa-tu.

               MVL_080229_TwoEyes_flkd.062As mentioned above in Section 1.1, pronominal objects never appear with a verb
conjugated by the objective conjugation.
   There are some examples, in which the object is introduced inmediatelly
before the verb. This constituent is shifted in the left-peripheral, sentence ini-
tial position, thus in the topic position, and expresses an old information,
which is activated now. It means that it is not a part of the next clause. In this
case, the verb is always conjugated by the objective conjugation as in (9).

Transitive-reflexive verbs, such as ďembɨsʲi ‘dress; dress oneself’, ďituďa ‘shoot;
shoot oneself’ etc. are always inflected in the reflexive-medial conjugation, if
their meaning is reflexive, as in sentences (10a and 11a–b). If the meaning is not
reflexive, but transitive, the verb can be conjugated by the subjective or objec-
tive conjugation.(10) a. bəjkuə-ðu         ďita-Ɂi-ðə.

              KES_080721_Disease_flkd.356Sentences (12a–b) show the reflexive-medial and transitive use of the same
verb. In (12a) the verb is in the subjective conjugation. In the sentence, there
are both arguments: an agent and a patient and the object of the verbs pre-
cedes the verb immediately. On the other hand, in (12b), the ‘door’ is also a
patient of the action, though it is not the grammatical object of the sentence,
but the subject. The agent is not overt. In this case, the verb must be conjugated
reflexively.(12) a. tɨbijki͡aa ŋua      təlʲü-Ɂə.

              TNK, 2006Medial verbs, such as nǝnsuďi with the meaning ‘get up’ and ‘stop’, are inflected
in the reflexive-medial or in the subjective conjugation, depending on their
actual meaning; objective conjugation is not possible. If the verb nǝnsuďi
means ‘get up’, it must be inflected in the reflexive conjugation, if it means
‘stop’ it can be conjugated in the subjective or in the reflexive conjugation. If
the action is changed and the sentence is highlighted, the verb meanig ‘stop’
remains in the reflexive conjugation as in (13c).(13) a. əiɁ, tə tahari͡aa ŋanaɁsa-gümü nənsu-Ɂi-ðə.

position (such as ŋomtüďi ‘sit down’ etc.) or change of state are inflected in the
reflexive conjugation, if the sentence emphasizes the change of state. The fol-
lowing two examples show the usage of verbs denoting change of body position
(see also sentence (12c) with the verb ‘get up’).(14) a. ŋanaɁsan-əi-Ɂ ŋomtü-tü-Ɂ.

              KNT_940903_KehyLuu.073However, it must be mentioned that not all verbs denoting movement can be
conjugated by the reflexive-medial conjugation. Only the following verbs are
able to take the reflexive endings: hojkuďa ‘run’; büüďa ‘go away’, čüüďa ‘arrive,
reach’, but they not necessary are conjugated reflexive (for motion verbs see
also Chapter 15, Section 3.2). The use of the conjugations is not evenly dis-
tributed. Table 9.1 illustrates the distribution of reflexive and non-reflexive form
of motion verbs in the corpus.
   The verb büüďa most often is conjugated reflexively, while other verbs take
subjective endings. The three following examples from three different speakers
provide examples of its two possible uses. In sentence (15a) the verb is in both
conjugations, in (15b) it is conjugated reflexively, and in (15c) it takes a subjec-
tive ending. Of course, the question arises, what determines the uses of one or
another conjugation.

cation of direction, while the verbs in the subjective conjugation are generally
accompanied by an indication of direction. However, it must be mentioned
that there are few exceptions as well.
   Sentences (16a–b) illustrate the use of the verb hojkuďa ‘run’. This verb is
much less frequently conjugated by the reflexive conjugation. If it is the case,
the verb means ‘run away, go away’, thus it denotes change, as sentence (16a)
depicts. If the verb denotes not only a change, but states the action, it is conju-
gated by the subjective conjugation as in (16b). Another verb with the meaning
‘run away’ (lʲüməďa) can be used only in connection with animals, and it mostly

a human or non-human agent. Only the form with transitive and passive suf-
fixes can take the reflexive conjugation, but in this case, the meaning of the
verbs is changed as in (18a). Sentence (18b) shows the regular form. For pas-

types, by subjective and reflexive as well. These verbs cannot be conjugated by
the objective conjugation. Interestingly, of two verbs which mean ‘become/get
angry’ one, bəlu͡ačusa, appears always in the reflexive conjugation in the corpus,
and the other, ŋɨaɁkisʲi, is always in the subjective. The following two examples
show these verbs. The semantics of mental verbs need further research.(20) a. sofsem bəlu͡ača-Ɂi-ðə                 ŋonəi-Ɂ.

tion. Passivization generally occurs, if the agent has a low thematic status and
the patient moves into the topic position. Here we can observe two strategies:
reflexive or subjective conjugation. The most frequent strategy is the former,
which is when the passive verb is conjugated reflexively. For more about pas-
sivization see Chapter 7, Section 2.1.","[353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366]"
"1.1     Subject
As stated above, Nganasan belongs to the nominative–accusative languages.
Therefore, the overt subject of an intransitive and a transitive active sentence
gets the same case marker, namely the nominative case in clauses with finite
verb and with non-verbal predicate as well. There is no distinction between an
agentive and a non-agentive subject or human and non-human subject. The
predicate must agree in person and number with the subject (see Section 1.1.1
below). The grammatical subject of the sentence tends to appear in the sen-
tence initial position, but adverbs and question words can precede it. Typical
subjects are expressed by a nominal phrase, which is composed of a modified
noun (1a), a simple noun, (1b) or a pronoun (1c).(1) a. {təti ŋi͡antu-rə}          ma-tə-tu

              ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.09364% of all subjects are a pronominal subject, but pronouns in the subject role
are regularly in all tenses omitted, as their antecedent is referred to by personal
verbal suffixes. Only 19% of these are overt in the sentence. Nganasan allows
referential null subject (1b), generic null subject as well as expletive null subject
(8a–b). In the examples below, all the pronominal subjects are totally absent.
It means that they are phonetically null-subjects, but the hearer can identify
it on the verbal ending. The 1st person and 2nd person pronominal subjects
are dropped freely in any context. The 3rd person subject is generally dropped
when it is already expressed in an earlier sentence or when the speaker assumes
that the hearer already knows who s/he is talking about.

conjugation). In such sentences, the converb form is an action noun rather than
an adverbial form. If the subject has a complement, such as an attributive adjec-
tive, it must appear before the subject and it takes a genitive case marker. This
word order is unusual, as the final position is occupied by the converb playing

The subject controls person and number marking on the verb, thus the predi-
cate must agree in person and number with the subject. If there is more than
one expression referring to a subject in the sentence, as in “s/he with her/his
father”, the predicate agrees with the logical subject as sentence (13) shows.(13) tə, mənə tənini i-sʲüə-m, D’ansəbüɁə            nanu

sentences (14a–b), the verb agrees with the logical subject, thus it appears in
the dual or most often in the plural. If the subject is an NP in the comitative
case as in sentences (15a–b), only the head NP must agree with the verb. The
sociative suffix is of postpositional origin, some speakers still use the genitive
before it, as in sentence (14b).

              ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.373There is another possibility to express comitative meaning. In this construc-
tion one part of the logical subject is referred to only by a verbal ending, and
the other part is an NP with the comitative postposition nanu as in (16a). As
mentioned above in these cases, the verb agrees with the logical subjects. If
the speaker wants to stress that the subjects (agents) acted together, the predi-
cate must be in the dual or plural, depending on the number of actors. Sentence
(16a) is a sentence with a covert subject; only the verb ending shows the agent.
The use of plural is not possible in this case. Sentence (16b) shows an exam-
ple of the NP in the comitative case. In the sentence, the verb agrees with the
logical subject, thus it takes the dual as well.(16) a. čii-Ɂə-gəj        ńuə-ntɨ         nanu.

           ChND, 2008Nominal categories are generally in the singular after a numeral or other quan-
tifier (cf. Section 7.6 in Chapter 3). If the noun appears in the singular form
(after a numeral), the subject and the predicate agree grammatically, thus the
verb is in the singular (18), but if the noun remains in the dual form, the verb
agrees in number with the noun, as in sentence (19). After quantifiers such as
ŋukəgəə ‘many, much’, bǝnsǝ ‘all’ or numerals, the predicate agrees formally with
the subject, i.e. it appears in the singular (20).(18) tahari͡aa büübtar-tu     tərəďi kərutətu      məu-ntənu sʲiti maɁ

"1.2.1       Mental Transfer
Three verbs of speech are used most often: munuďa ‘say’, ďebtuďa ‘tell’ and
kumunsa ‘what say/tell’. The theme is always marked with the accusative. It
remains in the nominative, if the verb takes the imperative 2sg ending, as in
sentence (3b). Pronominal agent can be expressed lexically, if it is emphasized
as in (3c), but it is most often realized as null-subject (cf. (3a)). The following
sentences show the most typical construction with mental transfer verbs.

           ‘I will tell the children a small tale, not a tale, a simple story.’
                MACh_93_TwoTales_flkd.001The most usual order of the constituent in a construction with the verb ďeb-
tuďa ‘tell’ is (A) T AD V, as in sentence (3c), but if the theme is topicalized as in
sentence (3b), it takes the preverbal position and the addressee moves into the
postverbal position. Thus, if the agent is present, it always takes the preverbal
position and always precedes the addressee.
   The verb munuďa behaves differently. As example (3a) demonstrates, this
verb normally appears in the main clause, and the subordinate clause is its
theme argument, which is normally expressed as indirect speech in languages
that have it—Nganasan, does not (see Section 3 in Chapter 14). This verb can-
not be used with substantives like sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ and ďürɨmɨ ‘story’ as objects. As
mentioned in Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10, the verb ‘what say’ does not have any
argument, the question word is incorporated into the verb. (For the structure
see example (49b) in Chapter 10.) So, there is a semantic difference between
the two verbs and their argument structures differ accordingly.
   Personal pronouns cannot take case markers and cannot be inflected in
the same manner as other nominal categories, thus if the recipient-like argu-
ment is pronominal, the speaker must use a different construction to code the
recipient. The oblique case forms of pronouns are replaced with postpositional
structures (see Section 4.1.1 in Chapter 3). In this case, the postposition ďa is
followed by the destinative suffix -Tə (-tə, -ðə), and by the oblique case form of
ditransitive constructions                                                     399possessive suffixes: ďatə-poss and ďaðə-poss. (For the paradigm, see Section
4.1.1 in Chapter 3). The pronominal addressee is mostly covert; it appears overtly
only to express emphasis. The personal pronoun can precede the postposition
(4b). If the special interrogative speech act verb kumunsa ‘what tell’ is used, the
theme argument cannot be expressed lexically (4a).(4) a.                          agent

The recipient of a verb expressing physical transfer is expressed by a postposi-
tional construction with na ‘to, near’, if it is pronominal. It takes a possessive
suffix from the oblique series which denotes the person of the recipient. This
postposition is optionally accompanied by a personal pronoun. The recipient

ient, but it is possible to insert another phrase between them. So, in sentence

ient and the theme. The word order is Th R V.(6) a.              theme                          agent recipient

                TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.2781.3      Covert Recipient and Addressee
The recipient and adressee must not be overtly expressed in a Nganasan ditran-
sitive construction. If the recipient/addressee is a pronoun, it may also be omit-
ted. But if the recipient/addressee is pronominal, the theme argument must
take a destinative marker (cf. Section 5, Chapter 4) and have a possessive suffix
referring to the recipient/addressee (possessive strategy). Thus, in a ditransitive
construction neither the agent nor the recipient/addressee must be expressed
by a lexical element; a morphological marker can refer to them. The agent is
encoded through verbal morphology, with the verbal personal ending, while
the recipient/addressee is encoded through nominal morphology, with the pos-
sessive suffix showing the person and number of the recipient/addressee. This
construction is illustrated with the following examples:(7) a. theme {recipient}           {agent}
       {mənu}-güə-ðə-{mtə}         ńi-sɨðə-{m}  təðu-Ɂ.

              KES_031115_Paris_nar.320The same construction appears in passive sentences. In such cases, the agent is
never omitted, and the theme argument moves to the topic position. The recip-
ient is expressed with the possessive suffix on the theme. The verb is always in
the reflexive conjugation and, of course, it agrees with the grammatical subject
of the sentence, that is, with the theme. This construction may occur with the
verb ‘give’ (9), but it is most often used with speech act verbs (8). In sentences
wit speech act verbs, the agent cannot be overt.","[416, 417, 418, 419, 420]"
"3.6.1       Simple Conditional
In this sentence type, only one of the clauses expresses conditionality, the other
clause is either a statement or the verb of the matrix clause is marked for mood,
but not for conditional. Temporal information is always encoded by a finite verb
form in the sub-clause. The order of the two clauses is not determined.
   The core of this clause is the conditional converb form -hüɁ in the adverbial
clause, which can be followed by a possessive suffix referring to the agent of the
structure (37a–b). The agent can also be marked by a nominal category in the
genitive (37c). If the agent is expressed by an NP the converb form never takes
the possessive suffix. If the nominalized form (converb form) neither takes the
possessive suffix nor is preceded by an NP in genitive, the statement is general,
as in (37d).(37) a. ńemɨ-ntə                 buə-mun-ə           ďilʲsʲiti-bi-tə,

           MVL_080229_TwoEyes_flkd.114In the conditional clause, the future tense is expressed by the future form of
the conditional converb (-hüɁnü), which can be followed by a possessive suf-
fix. The verb in the main clause can appear in the aorist form (39a), as well as in
the future (39b). The aorist indicates immediate future, while the future form
refers to distant future. This kind of construction can express consequence as

It takes the clause-initial position, before the subject and the nominalized con-
ditional form. Usually, it occurs with the future conditional form.(40) ńükü, {bɨələ mənə ďaŋgu-m-hünü-nə,}                          tənə

tional converb form must appear in the subordinated clause. A clause with a

the verb of the main clause is marked for the irrealis mood (for this mood see

           MVL_080229_TwoEyes_flkd.1193.6.2        Double Conditional
In double conditional sentences, the conditional sub-clause precedes the main
clause with the conclusion. In most cases, there is no conjunction in the sub-
clause. The verb in the main clause is in the irrealis mood (cf. Section 5.8 in
Chapter 5), if the sentence refers to the past, otherwise it takes the general
inflections for aorist or future. A converb form is used in the sub-clause. The
temporal reference of the two clauses need not be the same.
   In the sentences below the sub-clause is in the past, while the main clause is
in the present. The main verb of the main clause is in the irrealis form, while the
main verb of the sub-clause is in the past, accompanied by the converb of the
copula. In sentences (43a) and (43b) both clauses refer to the past. In sentence
(43a) the clauses express simultaneity. In the main clause, the verb is inflected
for irrealis, while in the sub-clause the verb takes the past tense marker and it
is accompanied by the conditional form of the BE-verb. In sentence (43b) the
time reference is not the same, because there is an anterior relation. The verb
in the main clause is also inflected for irrealis. As the irrealis cannot be used in
the past, only the subordinate clause marks the temporal reference of the main
clause: the past participle of the verb is followed by the past tense form of the
existential verb and the converb of the existential verb. Although both clauses
refer to the past, the circumstances caused the consequence, i.e. this is a case
of antecedence.

verb form -hüɁnü accompanied by the past form of the BE-verb remain in the
sub-clause. The verb in the main clause takes the irrealis mood marker. In the
following sentence, the subjects are not the same, thus the converb takes the
possessive suffix, and the main verb agrees with the subject of the main clause.
In both clauses the subjects are dropped, thus only the converbal and verbal
endings indicate them.(44) ŋuə-lʲaa-tənɨ kəmna-ŋku-ə i-sʲüə          i-hünü-ndüŋ

           MDN_97_War2_nar.0284       Relative ClausesRelative clauses are clauses that modify the NP in the sentence, those realized
as a complex sentence are quite rare. These relations are rather encoded by
participle constructions in which the participle is the attributive complement
of an NP. Generally, Nganasan uses prenominal relative (or restricting) clauses
(RelN structure), however it is also possible to place the head before the rel-
ative clause, compare sentences (45a–b). The participle keeps the argument
structure of the verb, and these complements precede the participle itself. Al-
most all kinds of participles (cf. Section 6.2 in Chapter 5 on participles) can
clause combining                                                            453appear in the relative clause. Nganasan does not use a relativizer like English
that. Differing from English, for example, where the relative pronoun can, but
must not be used: The beer I drank was good vs. The beer that I drank was good,
Nganasan does not have relative pronouns. The relative clause does not con-
tain an overt element (relativized NP or R-element) which is co-referential with
the head, thus Nganasan belongs to the languages, which use the common gap
strategy. As the sentences below display, direct object (45a), subject (45b) and
indirect object (45c) can be relativized. Sentences with the present participle
express simultaneity (45c–d). The structure with a past participle expresses an-
tecedence: the action expressed by the participle precedes the action described
by the main clause. The subjects of the two structures need not be the same. In
sentences (45a) and (45c) below, the subjects of the clauses are different.(45) a. relative clause head

lowing sentence, the grammatical subject of the matrix clause is only marked
on the predicate (‘they’), the subject of the relative clause is flagged by the
possessive suffix on the participle (‘you’). This sentence type is used when the
subject of the main clause is the object of the sub-clause (object relativization).(46) tahari͡aa, {əmə      ŋətə-ďüəďəə-tə}               məu-ntənu

7       Definiteness within the NPSome possessive suffixes can mark not only possessive relations, but also ref-
erential relation or definiteness, if the construction is a non-lexical attributive
possession construction (see in Section 4.2.1 above). (For more on this topic in
Uralic languages see among others, Körtvély 2010, Leinonen 2006, Siegl 2015,
Stachowski 2010, Zayzon 2015 etc.)
   The third possessive suffix sometimes marks definiteness or identification,
and not a real possessive relation. This frequently occurs for example in sen-
tences describing natural phenomena, but it must be mentioned that the use
of possessive suffixes on natural phenomena is not obligatory. Sentence (47a)
shows the use of the possessive suffix in this function in an elicited sentence,
while sentence (47b) shows a natural phenomenon without a definiteness
marker. (See also sentence (54a–b) in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.)(47) a. məu-ðu           sʲürü     ŋilʲənu čii-məə.

              KBD_71_PolarFox_nar.007Words such as ŋuǝ ‘deity’ almost never occur with possessive suffixes, and if
they do, these are always true possessive expressions.
    The possessive suffix can be used as well as in an identification (associative
anaphoric use) function in narrative texts. See the following fragments from a
text; in the first sentence the speaker introduces the topic (the Nganasan lan-
guage), and in the second, the possessive suffix points back to this topic, that
is, creates a connection between the two sentences (between the two words
‘Nganasan language’ and ‘language’).(48) a. təɁə, tɨmini͡a ńaadətə-mənɨ           buə-tüü-nüɁ

              ChND_080719_Life_nar.037The third possible use of the 3sg possessive suffix is direct anaphoric use. In
such cases the word with the suffix immediately follows or is very close to its
antecedent, as in the following pair of examples. Sentence (49a) introduces the
referent (kǝku ‘fog’) in verb form, and in (49b) the possessive suffix points back
to this introduced referent.(49) a. təə      məlʲči-tənɨ tahari͡abə tə horɨ-gəlʲičə-mə

              TKF_97_Djajku_flkd.209The 2sg possessive suffix is sometimes used in an identification function or to
mark definiteness in dialogues and narrative texts, without referring to a cer-
tain possessed entity. It marks the entity which was introduced in a preceding
section of a text. In this case, the function of the suffix is to point the identifi-
ability of the entity (anaphoric function) or mark topicalization. This usage is
shown by sentences (50a–c).(50) a. ǝiɁ tǝti tahari͡a bǝjkaɁa kona-Ɂa.

meral determiners (cf. Section 3.1 above) do not necessarily trigger definiteness.

it definite. The same is true of number marking, illustrated in (51b).(51) a. tɨmini͡a sʲiti tǝjbǝ tǝi-ču.

         chapter 9Types of PredicateThis chapter deals with the types of predicates. The predicate of a sentence
can be expressed by almost any word classes, not only through a verb. How-
ever, verbal predicates are most common, about 87% of all predicates are verbs.
They can be simple, containing only one verb or complex with more than one
verbal element. The following figure shows the occurrence of predicates in an
annotated sub-corpus. In the following sections, first the verbal predicates are
discussed.","[349, 350, 351, 352, 353]"
"6.3.2.4      Inchoative and Resultative Suffixes
Nganasan also has perfectivizing suffixes, which express a normally inchoative,
resultative or temporal meaning. One of the most frequently used derivational
suffixes is the inchoative suffix -LƏ (-lə, -lʲi) with the meaning ‘begin to S’, e.g.
hiďisʲi ‘laugh’ > hisʲi-lə-sʲi ‘begin to laugh’; ďaŋhɨďi ‘shine’ > ďaŋhɨ-lə-sɨ ‘begin
to shine’; ďorəďa ‘cry’ > ďorə-lə-sa ‘begin to cry’. This suffix can also express
semelfactivity, i.e. to indicate that the action happened only once. The stem of
such verbs is always a durative verb referring to a lengthy action, e.g. ďorəďa
‘cry’ > ďorə-lə-sa ‘cry out’; səŋü-r-sa ‘look’ cf. səŋü-lə-sa ‘catch sight of’; hiďisʲi
‘laugh’ > hisʲi-lə-sʲi ‘burst out laughing’. In contrast to Nenets (cf. Nikolaeva 2014:
46), the derivative in Nganasan does not belong to the reflexive inflectional
class, the verb can be conjugated by subjective or objective conjugation as well.
   The inchoative-resultative suffix-Ɂkə is a very frequent and productive deri-
vational suffix. It appears on the S1 stem of the verb. The derivative is always a
perfective verb (S1: V+-Ɂkə → VPerf). The meaning of the derived word is ‘begin
to do something and probably finish doing it as well’; ďarəðɨ-sɨ ‘be ill’: ďarəðɨ-

up’; ŋəm-sa ‘eat’: ŋəmə-Ɂkə-sa ‘begin to eat’(42) a. tahari͡aa təndɨ-čə            tolɨ-Ɂkə-sɨðə-Ɂ ńeraɁa.

               KES-ChND_080725_Childhood_conv.046There is a temporal suffix -Kəl (-kəl, -gəl) with the meaning ‘at the moment’.
This rare suffix describes actions that are limited in time. The meaning of the
derivatives is similar to the meaning of words with an inchoative suffix, e.g.
barə-ďa ‘wait’ > barə-gəl-sa ‘wait a little’; bi͡arə-ďi ‘open’ > bi͡arə-gəl-sɨ ‘open a
little’; ďeru-sa ‘not to know’ > ďeru-gəl-sa ‘not to know a little’.
    The intentional suffix -ɁhA2n (-Ɂhu͡an, -Ɂhi͡an) attaches to the S1 or S3 stem
of an imperfective or perfective verb. The emerging verb is always perfective
(S1/S3: Vperf/imperf + -ɁHA2n → Vperf). The derivates typically occur next to
motion verbs as a purposive adjunct, but motion verbs themselves can also take
this suffix, e.g. čiiɁni͡ar-hi͡an-sɨ ‘intend to enter’, tujsʲa ‘come’ > tuuɁnar-hu͡an-sa
‘intend to come’.(43) a. hii-m-a-tu               ďa čiə-ďiəďəi-nə

The frequentative suffix -r is primarily used as an aspect marker: it forms imper-
fective verbs, but it also carries its original, frequentative meaning, e.g. ŋəmsa
‘eat (up)’ > ŋəmursa ‘eat’; mənəgəisʲa ‘fall down’ > mənəgəirsʲa ‘fall down usu-
ally’; laŋəɁkəsa ‘shout’ cf. laŋürsʲa ‘shout occasionally’; tolɨďi ‘steal something’
> tolarsa ‘steal occasionally’
    Words with the suffix -ɁnA2r (-(Ɂ)nar, -(Ɂ)ni͡ar) describe events that are
repeated within irregular intervals in a certain period of time. The derivational
suffix is morphologically complex. It is made up of two suffixes with a fre-
quentative meaning, although the -na morpheme is not used as a separate
derivational suffix in present day Nganasan. The meaning of words with the
-r frequentative suffix (see above) describe events repeated more regularly, as
the sentences in the corpus show. Examples: büü-ďa ‘go away’ > büü-Ɂnar-sa ‘go
away more than once’; kou-ďa ‘drop behind’ > kou-Ɂnar-sa ‘drop behind more
than once’; tuj-sʲa ‘arrive’ > tuu-Ɂnar-sa ‘come’.(44) a. ŋuɁəð -ə      kobtu͡a-nə       ďa bənsə-ruɁ tuu-Ɂnar-u-ruɁ.

               KNT, 1994The suffix -btU is also used as an attenuative suffix which forms attenuative
(diminutive) verbs (‘to S a bit’), e.g. ďorə-ďa ‘cry’ > ďorə-btu-sa ‘cry a bit’; bi͡arə-
ďi ‘open’ > bi͡arə-btɨ-sɨ ‘open a bit [e.g. a door]’; ďilə-ďi ‘lift’ > ďilə-btɨ-sɨ ‘lift a

           KNT, 1996There is a distributive suffix with the form -A2lU (-alu, -i͡alɨ) and with the mean-
ing ‘to S very much, abundantly’. This suffix forms imperfective verbs from
perfective verbs. It deletes the final vowel of the stem.(48) a. bɨðɨbt-i͡alɨ-rɨ-ndi-ti

tive) suffix -nA2NTU (-ni͡antɨ, -nantu, -nandu, -ni͡andɨ), which express the light
modal meaning ‘want to S’. The suffix turns imperfective or perfective verbs
into imperfective verbs, e.g. hoðətəsa ‘write’ > hoðətə-nantu-sa ‘want to write’;
kundu͡asa ‘sleep’ > kundu͡a-nantu-sa ‘want to sleep’; ńilɨďi ‘live’ > ńilɨ-nantu-ďa

              TKF_061105_FoxFosterling_flk.116In Nganasan expressing the concept ‘wanting’ is also possible using verbal con-
cept. There are two verbs with the meaning ‘want’: kərbuďa and hujsʲi. If no
other verbal element occurs in the sentences, instead of the volitive suffix, one
of these verbs must be used. The verb hujsʲi can have an argument as direct
object, which also stays in accusative (50b). The verb kərbuďa cannot have an
direct object as argument. (More on the distribution of the verbs see Jark 2018.)(50) a. ďaŋku,       ńi-ndɨ-m           kərbu-Ɂ, maa-gəlʲičə nɨ

fixes or certain case suffixes, for example with the genitive plural suffixes -Ɂ
(ńaagəǝ: ńaagəiɁ ‘good’ [adv]) and with the prolative suffixes -mənu (ərəkərə:
ərəkərə-mənu ‘beautifully’). Both suffixes form adverbs of manner. (For the case
suffixes, see Section 3, Chapter 4).
   The caritive suffix -KA2lʲi creates adverbs of manner or circumstance from
nouns, e.g. ŋənduj ‘boat’: ŋəndujkalʲi ‘without a boat’; tuj ‘fire’: tuj-kalʲi ‘without
fire’; tala ‘happiness’: tala-kaľi ‘unhappily’. Another privative denominal suf-
fix is the suffix -KA2j. Adverbs ending in this suffix are generally used together
with the word ičuə, which is the present participle form of the copula (isʲa), e.g.
sʲejmɨ ‘eye’: sʲejmɨgaj ičuə ‘blind’ [‘being without eyes’]; čiirü ‘cloud’: čiirügi͡aj
ičuə ‘clear’ [‘being without clouds’]; nɨ ‘woman’: nɨgi͡aj ičuə ‘single’ [‘being with-
out a wife’]; ńuə ‘child’: ńuəgaj ičuə ‘childless’ [‘being without a child’]. The
usage of these two suffixes is illustrated with the following sentence pair.(52) a. Seu Melʲaŋgana-tǝ sɨlɨ, kǝči sɨlɨ-gəlʲičǝ sejmɨ-gaj i-čuǝ

              KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.066The suffix -səbtə has a sociative meaning (‘together with S forming a single
entity’) and forms adverbs from nouns: ŋuhu ‘sleeve’ > ŋubusəbtə ‘together with
a sleeve’; taa ‘reindeer’ > taasəbtə ‘together with a reindeer’; kahi͡a ‘clothes of a
shaman’ > kabi͡asəbtə ‘together with the clothes of a shaman’. For more exam-

           ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.0307       Clitic-like MorphemesThere are some morphemes in Nganasan whose morphological status is not
determined with certainty. Based on the way they are used, they form an inter-
mediate category between derivational suffixes and clitics. They are character-
ized by not behaving consistently: their position can depend on the speaker or
the part of speech of the word as well. Practically all of them can co-occur with
verbal and nominal stems, but not with the same frequency: some morphemes
occur more frequently with nominal stems. But their position in relation to
each other is set, although they do not occur together very often. The following
morphemes belong to this group: -Küə, -KüCmü, -ŋUTU, -ŋA2lə, -Kəlʲičə, -btA2,
-Cčǝ and -uɁ. In the discussion below, I will refer to these morphemes as “clitic-
like morphemes”.

verbal and nominal suffixes. These morphemes can occur in three positions.
The morphemes that still preserve their clitic-like characteristics always occur
word-finally, whereas those that are relatively lexicalized precede even tense/
mood suffixes.","[551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558]"

1        Coding of Recipient and AddresseeAs mentioned above, the recipient is the receiver of an object which is trans-
ported to him by an agent argument. The most typical recipient is animate.
There is more than one possibility to mark a recipient. The marking of the recip-
ient depends on the type of verb. The argument of physical transfer verbs takes
the lative suffix, while the argument of mental transfer verbs takes a postposi-
tional phrase.
396                                                                  chapter 111.1      Lative/Dative Coding
The basic type of the ditransitive construction is the dative construction. As
the following sentences show, if the recipient is lexically expressed in the
sentence, the theme is marked with the accusative, while the recipient, with
the lative/dative case (-ntǝ). The most usual order of constituents is A(gent)
Th(eme) R(ecipient) V(erb), but as sentences (1b–c) show, the recipient or the
theme can appear postverbally. The preverbal participant is always topicalized.
The agent is only seldom overt. Typologically, the most prototypical ditransitive
verb is misʲi ‘give’, for this reason examples with this verb are provided here.
As sentence (2) shows there are no differences between the recipient marking
with other verbs.(1) a. agent theme recipient

If it is pronominal, the verbal ending of the objective conjugation series can
indicate this.(2) covert theme             addressee

           ChND, 20161.2      Postpositional Coding
There are two postpositions used in the construction: the allative postposition
ďa and the postposition na ‘to, near’. Their usage depends on the type of verb.
If the verb denotes mental transfer, i.e. it is a verb of speech (‘tell’, ‘say’ etc.)
or a verb of explication (‘show’ etc.), the recipient-like participant (addressee)
cannot be encoded with the lative/dative case, it must be expressed by a post-
positional phrase with the allative postposition ďa. If the participant is a true
recipient, the verb expresses physical transfer and the postposition ďa cannot
be used. In this case, the inflected postposition na ‘to, near’ is used, marked for
case with an ancient case marker (cf. Section 4.1.2 in Chapter 3), and takes a
possessive suffix from the oblique series.","[414, 415, 416]"
"6.1.1        Evaluative Suffixes
The inventory of evaluative suffixes, which consists of diminutives and aug-
mentatives, is quite rich. The augmentatives signal a bigger version of the
basis. There are four augmentative suffixes: -Ɂəə, -Ɂa, -Ɂuə and -RbA1ɁƏ (-rbaɁa,
-rbɨɁə). The -Ɂuə (-Ɂüə) derivational suffix occurs only with persons’ names,
such as, D’indüɁüa (cf. ďindü ͡a ‘horse’). The most common suffix is -Ɂa (-Ɂu͡a,
-Ɂi͡a). This suffix attaches to the S2 stem of a noun and the emerging word is
also a noun, which cannot be modified by an adverb. The stem noun must have
a concrete referent: sɨtəbɨ ‘tale’ > sʲitəbɨ-Ɂɨ͡a ‘long tale’; muŋku ‘tree’ > muŋku-
Ɂu͡a ‘big tree’, korɨ ‘box’ > kora-Ɂa ‘big box’. The following two sentences show
the usage of this suffix.(12) a. tə konɨ-ďiə-mɨɁ takəə             təi-ču      turka-Ɂa Arɨlak.

ratives they often serve selective functions, as in (13) below.(13) ǝi, kunі-nі           i-ŋu     kurəďi

           TKF_97_Djajku_flkd.060The suffix can be attached to adjectival stems as well: ďebsalka ‘with an eye-
brow’ > ďebsalka-Ɂa ‘with a hairy eyebrow’; ďüntəə ‘deaf’ > ďünta-Ɂa ‘totally
deaf’; ďerbajkuə ‘fat’ > ďerbajkaɁa ‘very fat’. The present participle can occur as
a base for derivation as well. The form with the augmentative suffix expresses
the permanency of the quality or characteristic. Forms derived by this can func-
tion as attributive premodifiers or predicates.(14) a. tətі tətі, kundu͡а-tа-Ɂа             tətі mаа-gəlʲčə sʲеjmɨ-tɨ,

terms and has a slightly pejorative meaning. Its use is illustrated by the two sen-
tences in (15a–b). Sentence (15b) clearly demonstrates that grandpa appears in

is a separate suffix -ďA1ɁA2 with a pejorative meaning. The suffix appears only
on nominal stems and is often attached to kinship terms or nouns denoting
animals.(16) a. əiɁ ńemɨ-ďiɁi͡a-tɨ        tu-u-Ɂə             ŋua    bi͡ari

              KES_080721_Disease_flkd.173The fourth augmentative suffix, -RbA1ɁA is also less frequent, e.g. hu͡alə ‘stone’
> hu͡alʲü-rbaɁa ‘huge stone’; muŋku ‘tree’ > muŋka-rbaɁa ‘tall tree’; kojkə ‘idol’
> kojkü-rbaɁa ‘big idol’. This suffix attaches to the S3 stem of a noun. The stem
noun must have a concrete referent. The suffix can also be attached to an adjec-
tive: aniɁkaa ‘big’ > aniɁka͡u-rbaɁa ‘very big’; ďüntəə ‘deaf’ > ďüntə-rbaɁa ‘rather
deaf’.
   There are four diminutive suffixes, of which -A2Ɂku and -A2ŋku are more
frequent, while -Ɂku and -mA2Ɂku are quite rare. The choice between the two
512                                                                         chapter 16frequent diminutive suffixes -A2Ɂku and -A2ŋku is not triggered by the pho-
netic environment, the number of stem syllables, or by the harmonic class of
the stem. The diminutives denote a smaller version of the base or can be used to
express a pejorative meaning as well, e.g. asʲa ‘Dolgan’ > aďa-ku ‘little Dolgan’.
   The derivational suffix -A2Ɂku attaches to nouns with a stem with a structure
different from CVV. The stem must have a concrete referent. The suffix deletes
the stem final vowel: horə ‘face’ > hor-aɁku ‘little face’; kolɨ ‘fish’ > kol-aɁku ‘little
fish’; səmu ‘cap’ > səm-aɁku ‘little cap’; hütəðə ‘trunk’ > hütəð-aɁku ‘little trunk’.(17) kuraa kon-akü bigi-lʲi-Ɂi-ðə.

            KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.130The suffix -A2ŋku can attach to nouns with a concrete referent or to adjectives.
The structure of the stem is not CVV. The suffix deletes the stem final vowel:
konə ‘young’ > kon-aŋku ‘little young’; ďaŋur ‘tundra’ > ďaŋur-aŋku ‘little tun-
dra’; barusʲi ‘devil’ > barusʲ-i͡aŋku ‘little devil’; maɁ ‘tent’ > mað-aŋku ‘little tent’;
lərəə ‘inexperienced’ > lər-aŋku ‘a bit inexperienced’; nəŋhə ‘bad’ > nəmb-aŋku

            KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.108The -Ɂku suffix can be attached either to the S2 stem of nouns or adjectives. The
stem must have a concrete referent, and it often has the structure CVV, e.g. ńuə
‘child’ > ńuə-Ɂkü ‘little child’; ərəkərə ‘beautiful’ > ərəkərə-Ɂku ‘a bit beautiful’;
balu͡a ‘strict’ > balu͡a-Ɂku ‘a bit strict’.
   The suffix -mA2Ɂku (-maɁku, -mi͡aɁku) is a complex suffix which often ap-
pears on personal names, but it can also attach to other concrete nouns. The
stem is not CVV. The second element of the suffix is the -A2Ɂku diminutive suf-
fix (see above): ďiŋi ‘knot’ > ďiŋimi͡aɁku ‘Dingimyaku [‘little knot’]’; čenɨ ‘Cheny’
> čenɨmi͡aɁku ‘little Cheny’.
   Some forms bearing augmentative or diminutive suffixes are lexicalized

ing of this word is ‘little animal’. This is the only word in which the -Ɂku ~
-ŋku alternation can be observed. Other forms which were lexicalized with the
diminutive suffix are kǝǝlʲükü ‘short’, and ǝligaɁku ‘small’. The adjective aniɁǝ
‘big’ is formally also marked with an augmentative suffix; however, the stem
ani is no longer used at present.
   The suffix -Ti͡aj (-ti͡aj, -ði͡aj) is used to derive words which signal that the con-
crete noun or living being functions as a plaything, e.g. taa ‘domesticated rein-
deer’ > taaði͡aj ‘toy reindeer’; ńuə ‘child’ > ńuəði͡aj ‘doll’; kəntə ‘sledge’ > kəntəði͡aj
‘toy sledge’; luu ‘dress’ > luuði͡aj ‘doll’s clothes’. The list in Table 16.1 summarizes
the evaluative suffixes and their morphological rules.","[528, 529, 530, 531, 532]"
"1.1         S1-Stem
This stem is considered as the basic stem and it is determined by removing the
infinitive suffix from the infinitive form of the verb: tujsʲa ‘come’: tuj-; konɨďi ‘go
away’: konɨ-; bɨðɨrsʲa ‘drink’: bɨðɨr-.
    There are however cases, where, under the effect of the phonological rules,
removing the infinitive ending does not yield the S1-stem, but a form that
cannot be suffixed. This is mostly true of the verbs which S1-stem ends in -j.
This stem-ending -j in many cases has merged with the infinitive ending and
palatalized its consonant, and synchronically is no longer visible (for palatal-
ization and deletion see Section 7.3 and Section 7.6 in Chapter 2). The verb
‘be’ and existential verbs containing the verb ‘be’ belong to this group, as i-sʲa
‘be’: ij-; təi-sʲa ‘exist’: təij-; təni-sʲa ‘exist’: tənij-. The /j/ has disappeared from all
forms of these verbs, but the forms themselves show that it is present in the
216                                                                        chapter 5deep form of the stem. This explains, for instance, the 3sg form of the verb
‘be’, which has on the surface the non-motivated palatalization, and is seem-
ingly irregular, but is easily derived from the stem ij-: ij+ntu > ij +tu > iču ‘s/he
is’.
     As concerns verbs ending in -gəj, -Kuj or -sɨj, the stem-final -j is deleted or it
appears as palatalization on the first consonant of the infinitive suffix by some
speakers. For additional information about these forms, see chart (6) in Section
1.3 below.
     We also find many verb stems, which contain an empty slot in the last syl-
lable. They seem to end in a vowel, but phonologically behave as consonant-
ending stems; e.g. the immediately following consonant does not conform to
phonological rules, because the empty consonant blocks the gradation (cf.
Section 7.1 in Chapter 2). In many cases this explains a seemingly irregular
infinitive form. Chart (1) below shows verbs that should have a weak grade con-
sonant in the infinitive suffix. The trace of the empty slot can also appear in
consonant alternations in S2/S3 stems. (For empty slot see Section 4.4 in Chap-
ter 2.)(1) Stems ending in an empty slotInfinitive form S1-stem         Meaningməbki-sʲi          məbkiC- ‘press’

nəgu-sa            nəguC-  ‘make faces’
1.2       S2-Stem
There is more than one way of forming this stem. Either by removing the imper-
ative 2sg suffix -Ɂ from the imperative form of the verb, or by removing the
ending -Ɂ from the connegative form of the verb: tuɁ ‘come [imp.2sg or cng]’:
tu-; konɨɁ ‘go [imp.2sg or cng]’: konɨ-; bɨtɨrəɁ ‘drink [imp.2sg or cng]’: bɨtɨrə-.
The S1 and the S2 forms of vowel-final stems are generally identical.
    The stems with the stem ending consonants -m, -n, -r and -l generally do not
alternate, the S2 stem is identical to the S1 stem, as in bəjkum-sa ‘get older’: S1=S2
bəjkum-; hon-sa ‘spin’: S1=S2 hon-; hojküür-sa ‘run’: S1=S2 hojküür-; buəgəlsa
‘talk’: S1=S2 buəgəl-.
    There is a small group of n-stem verbs, which have S1 and S3 stems without
the final consonants. These verbs are listed below in chart (5). These are mainly
polysyllabic imperfective verbs.
verbal inflection                                                                 217    There is no -j in the S2 stem of verbs with the durative suffix -Kuj or in
verbs with the -gəj ending with the S3 stem of these verbs containing a vowel
sequence. S2 and S3 are identical for -sɨj verbs. See chart 6 below in Section 1.3
for more on the form of these verbs.
    Irregular verbs are very rare, however there are some verbs which have sup-
pletive forms, such as isʲa ‘be’, which has an irregular second stem: ŋuə- or the
verb məj-sʲi ‘do’, with the S2-stem mɨə-. The S2 stem of the existential verbs
(təisʲa; tənijsʲa) and the negative existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) (all those complex
verbs whose second element is the BE verb) are irregular as well. They have a
-b at the end of their stem. Three other verbs also deserve mention, which are
listed in the chart (2) below.(2) b-stem verbsInfinitive form S1-stem S2-stem             Meaningďaŋguj-sʲa         ďaŋguj-    ďaŋgujbǝ-     ‘be absent, not exist’

toj-sʲa            toj-       tojbǝ-        ‘be not needed’
The BE verb has to be discussed in detail, as it not only has a suppletive stem,
but also irregular forms in certain cases. The irregular forms of the verb isʲa
‘be’ are: ŋuəɁ ‘be!’ [imp.2sg or cng], ibahu ‘the rumour says’ [be-rep.3sg] (the
regular form would be *ihu͡aŋhu).
   Verbs that have the glottal stop in their stem constitute a special case. The
stem-final glottal stop (-ʔ) alternates with the weak grade /s/, and /t/, i.e. with -ď
and -ð (cf. Syllabic Gradation in Chapter 2, Section 7.1.3) and very rarely with -k.
This alternation occurs only in the S2 and S3 stems. Among verbal stems there
are only few lexems in which the alternating consonant is -ð: ďaɁ-sa ‘forge’:
ďað-; kəsa ‘bind’: kəð-; ho-sɨ ‘set (Sun)’: hoð-; and only one verb with deleted /k/:
ďüCsa ‘lose’: ďük-. Chart (3) displays some Ɂ/s-stem verbs.

Some of the verbs, which end in a long vowel in their S1 stem have an S2 stem
with a short vowel, and in the S3 stem, a vowel alternation appears. There are
also verbs, whose stems do not alternate in their S2 stem, but the vowel alterna-
tion can be witnessed in S3. (For both verb types see chart (8) below.) There is
another group of shortening stems—mostly disyllabic stems—which shorten
in their S2 variant, but exhibit no alternation in S3. These verbs are listed in
chart (4).","[234, 235, 236, 237]"
