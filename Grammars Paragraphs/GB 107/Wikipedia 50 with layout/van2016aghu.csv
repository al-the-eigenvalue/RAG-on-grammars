Now consider Table 27 below. This table shows that there is a certain
asymmetry, within the domain of irrealis forms, between positive sentences
and negative sentences when we consider their relation to mood. The
relation between finiteness and mood in positive sentences was discussed in
2.3.1.4 above: finite future forms only allow for a declarative reading, while
semifinite forms are used for optative modality, volitive modality (strong
intention) or may even have a declarative-affirmative reading; see the
second column in the table below.

5.5.1 Simple conditional sentences
Drabbe 1957:23aSimple, positive conditional sentences consist of an imperative or semifinite
irrealis clause that forms the protasis, and a future clause that forms the
apodosis. (575) through (577) are examples with a semifinite protasis, while
(578) exemplifies the use of an imperative. Note that (578) differs only
minimally from (577).(575)   ba-gidi             a         aw=            akī

         Drabbe 1957:23a)
Negative conditional sentences are formed by the use of a negated verbal
noun which is predicated by the use of ki(k) ‘become’. This was illustrated
in (52) and (53) above (section 2.3.2.2.9 on verbal nouns in negative
sentences), and is repeated here as (579) and (580), respectively:(579)   ba-gidi                a       aw=akin=de                       kĩ

5.5.2 Counterfactual conditional sentences
Drabbe (1957): section 58, p. 23Counterfactual conditional sentences are marked by a marker fini + copula
oxo in the final position of the protasis. Although Drabbe refers to fini as
an irrealis marker, I will gloss it as CFT ‘counterfactual’, to avoid the
suggestion that fini would combine with irrealis verbs; in fact, in all cases
fini combines with realis verbs. There is a certain ‘logic’ to the use of a
realis, in that fini combines with verbs that refer to events that could in
principle have been actualized — this is expressed by the use of realis in
the verbal clause — but in fact have not — this is expressed by the use of
the counterfactual marker plus copula oxo. The structure of the protasis is
analogous to the structure of negative clauses and interrogative clauses
(discussed in 2.6, 2.7 and especially 4.6), as is clear from a comparison of
the following clauses, where NgCFT stands for negative counterfactual.","[355, 356, 357]"
"
Drabbe states that these forms are “future indicative forms, so that adejè
means „I will hear”” (Drabbe 1957:14b), where it should be noted that he
contrasts them with the semifinite forms that he has dealt with in the
directly preceding section and which he describes as ‘optatives’. In line
with Drabbe’s explanation and the data in the text corpus, I will
characterize the finite future forms as basically exhibiting a declarative-
affirmative function: with the use of a finite future the speaker expresses
that (s)he expects the event expressed by the verb to happen, or to become
true.",[94]

The list below is meant as a help for those who want to use Drabbe’s
original publication. While the relation between Drabbe’s terminology and
the one used in this publication can often be found through the use of a
dictionary, in certain cases the relation is less straightforward. It is these
cases that have been mentioned in the list below.","[844, 845, 846, 847, 848, 849, 850, 851, 852, 853, 854, 855, 856, 857, 858, 859]"

        ‘She sees that he has no wound’ (lit. ‘she sees: there is no wound’; 6.127)
Negative existentials are also used to express a ‘not having’ and can as such
be seen as the negative counterpart of the expressions with positive
possessive interpretation discussed in 2.8.1.(489)   na         xoja         fede       xo
        1SG.POS    spear        NEG        COP

A typical way to close off a story is the following:(491)   Fede       xo.      Tamajõ

292                                 PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureDrabbe closes his section on negative nonverbal clauses with some related
uses of fede. The expression fede ki is used for ‘cease to exist’. In some
expressions we find de instead of fede: u de ki(k) [voice NEG become] ‘be
dumb’; suketo de ki(k) [ear NEG become] ‘be deaf’ and kiokone de ki(k)
[eye NEG become] ‘be blind’.","[309, 310]"

     Note that we have to do here with modality, more than with mood, which can be seen as
grammaticalized modality that is morphologically expressed, cf. footnote 83 above. In
Aghu, the core system of oppositions in mood is formed by a system of morphological
oppositions between three types of stems: stems of type I, stems of type II and imperative
stems. Here we have to do with other ways of — less grammaticalized — expressing
oppositions in modality.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                      121Table 28: Negated semifinite irrealis and future forms

N1PL        ad-enan-Ø=dè xo            adenaŋ=gu òxo
Considering the form of the negated semifinite forms, it is not hard to see
that here we have to do with a formative ku and a formative oxo, where the
latter can be functionally and formally equated to the predicator (o)xo that
is also used in the other negative constructions. The formative ku, which
given the analogy to the negator de in the other forms is synchronically
analyzed as a negator, can probably be historically related to the emphatic
marker ku ‘EMP’ that we find in emphatic pronouns, cf. section 3.2.1. This
would make the development of ku analogous to what Wester describes for
the negator de (Wester 2014: 131-32). Citing Croft (1991:5) on the sources
of verbal negators, she convincingly argues that the negator de that is found
in several Awyu languages has an emphatic marker de as its source (which88
     It is noteworthy that the verb forms in this column could, formally, also be analyzed as
semifinite forms, with assimilation of the final autonomous nasal (in all forms except 1SG)
to the following alveolar. Drabbe, however, analyzes the forms as finite forms in which the
final e of the future marker is elided. I will follow Drabbe at this point for two reasons.
First, analyzing the forms in =kuoxo as semifinites and those in the first column as finites
makes sense from a paradigmatic point of view, and is in line with the function of the two
forms. Both in positive sentences and in negative sentences we then have finite and
semifinite forms, with the finite forms associated (primarily) with indicative-declarative
mood, and the semifinites with other types of mood — see Table 27 above. Second, we
find an analogous elision of final future e in the interrogative forms discussed in 2.7
(which are forms that cannot be analyzed as semifinite forms, see the discussion there).
The forms should, therefore, be analyzed as ade-Ø=dè xo [hear_II[1SG]-FUT=NEG COP] ‘I
will not hear’etc.
122                                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
has survived in Aghu as an emphatic marker de with copular function, as
well as in the optional negator fede.)
Drabbe describes the negated semifinite forms as ‘negative optatives’ and
gives the following examples. Unfortunately, no additional examples were
attested.(136)   nu       atosunu             aküme=ku            òxo
        1SG      take.care.IMP[SG]   die_II[1SG]=NEG     COP
        ‘take care of me so that I may not die’ (Drabbe 1957:14b)
(137)   amse          xo    büsiü     axi-nàŋ=gu          òxo
        children      DST   house     go_II-N1PL=NEG      COP
        ‘do not let the children go home’ (Drabbe 1957:14b)
Drabbe gives only few illustrations of negated finite future forms. With the
following example he illustrates that negated future forms are also used for
expressing “a not being allowed”:(138)   siü        fed’              axij-e              xo
        1SG        NEG               die_II[1SG]=NEG     COP
        ‘I am not allowed to eat bananas’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
He uses the examples below to illustrate that instead of the future forms
“one likes to use, if this matches the meaning of the sentence”, a negative
verbal noun plus mũ ‘not want’, so that (139) and (140) can be used in the
same situation:(139)   axi=de              xo
        go_II[1SG]=NEG      COP
        ‘I will not go’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
(140)   axi-n=de            mu-ne / madüe
        go_II-VN=NEG        not.want-1.RLS[SG] / not.want_II[1SG]
        ‘I do not want to go / I shall not want to go’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                   123Other examples of negative volitives are the following:(141)   adi-n=de           muŋ-ge-nã
        eat_II-VN=NEG      not.want-N1.RLS-N1PL
        ‘they do not want to eat’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)
(142)   efe      n-u            ade-n=de            madüe
        3SG      LNK-sound      hear-VN=NEG         not.want_II[1SG]
        ‘I do not want to obey him’ (lit. ‘I do not want to listen to his voice’;
        Drabbe 1957:16b)
Note that the examples above contain a negative marker de, in spite of the
fact that the verb mũ has a negative meaning in itself (cf. 2.3.2.2.10).
Instead of a verbal noun, one may also use a negative future form. Thus,
(143) below has the same meaning as (141) above:(143)   adi-nan- Ø=-de             muŋ-ge-nã
        eat_II-N1PL-FUT=NEG        not.want-N1.RLS-N1PL
        ‘they do not want to eat’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)

Drabbe 1957: section 17, p. 9Interrogative nominal clauses are formed by means of the question particle
ka, as in (492), or by means of sentence final da xajo, where da is analyzed
as a copula, and xajo as a question particle, as in (493) and (494).209 The
optional use of the case markers te ‘NOM’ and the focus marker ke ‘FOC’ is
analogous to what was described for the affirmative counterparts.(492)      g-eto          ka.

      Drabbe remarks that ‘we do not find de (da) very often with adjectives’. This suggests
that it is possible, though rare, to form adjectival question clauses in the same way as

2.3.2.2.8 With a numeral verb
Drabbe 1957: section 40, p. 16aVerbal nouns are used in combination with numeral verbs, as in the
following examples (more on numeral verbs can be found in 2.9 and
3.10.2). Here verbs in -mV ‘do’ have verbal nouns whose final vowel
alternates between ã and ẽ, while the stems in e “always have ẽ.”52(45)      baxẽ           womĩ       okuomasikem-oxe-nã

Drabbe 1957: section 42, p. 16a-bVerbal nouns are also used in negation, as in the following examples:52
     I assume that those stems in e that always have a verbal noun in ã, like tame – tamã
‘write’, form an exception to this.

       ‘before we were born, this tree had sprouted already’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)
The construction illustrated here, although formed with irrealis stems
(which also form the basis for fully finite future stems), can only be used
for the negation of present and past events. Sentence (51) is an example of
the use of this construction in the text corpus:(51)   Joxo          namse              edaxende              xo.
       joxo          n-amse             edaxe-n=de            xo

       They do not give to their children.(2.012)
While future negation is generally expressed by negated fully finite verbs
(more on which can be read in 2.6), for negative future conditionals one
uses the verbal nouns under discussion here. However, to form a negative
conditional predicate, one does not use the copula xo, but the N1SG irrealis
form of the verb ki(k) ‘become’, as is illustrated in (52) and (53).

         ‘if you don’t work, I will not give you tobacco’ (Drabbe 1957:23a)2.3.2.2.10 As complement of mũ refuse / not want
Drabbe 1957: section 42, p. 16bIn line with its use in negation, described in the previous paragraph, the
verbal noun is also used as complement of the verb mũ ‘refuse / not.want’.
Interestingly, the verbal noun is followed by =de NEG, so that we formally
have to do with double negation. Analogous to what we saw in
constructions with the auxiliary mV ‘do’ in 2.3.2.2.5 above (which express
intention), here it is also possible to use a finite future instead of a verbal
noun, so that both (54a) and (b) are acceptable. In cases like this, the stress
on the verb is prefinal, so that the final future suffix -e is often elided.(54a)    adi-n=de             muŋ-ge-nã
         eat_II-VN=NEG        not.want-N1.RLS-N1PL

         ‘they refused to eat’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                       65The following example has been taken from the text corpus.(55)     joxo      edaxende                 muŋgenã.

         ‘They do not want to give (it to their children).’ (2.024)
The construction with mũ is also used for negative commands or
prohibitives, as in (56a) below. It is also possible, however, to use a future
form instead of a verbal noun, parallel to what we saw in (54a) and b
above:(56a)    oxẽ           manefi-oxone
         speak_II.VN   not.want.IMP-PL
         ‘do (pl.) not say!’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)
(b)      oxe-nàn(-e)           manefi-oxone
         speak_II.N1PL-FUT     not.want.IMP-PL
         ‘do (pl.) not say!’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
The following is an example of a third person ‘prohibitive’, for which one
uses a semifinite irrealis 3rd person form:(57)     dafĩ                  madü-nã
         come_II.VN            not.want_II-N1PL
         ‘let them not come!’ (Drabbe 1957:16b-17a)

2.3.2.3 Verbal nouns formed on the basis of a stem of type II plus
          nasalization, with augmented à.
Drabbe 1957: sections 35-36, p. 15bVerbal nouns can be augmented with a vowel a that bears primary stress,
resulting in forms like axinà ‘come_II.VN’, where the autonomous nasal
survives as n. Augmented verbal nouns are found in the following contexts.","[80, 81, 82, 83, 84]"
"
It is not possible to negate an imperative form. Instead, Aghu speakers use
an imperative form of mũ ‘not want’ with a verbal noun as complement.
Some of the examples given by Drabbe are presented here (mafi-oxone is a
shorter variant of manefi-oxone):(129)   dugu          simã          manefi
        roof          twine_II.VN   not.want.IMP[SG]
        ‘don’t twine a roof’ (Drabbe 1957: 16b)
(130)   tamã          mafi-oxone
        write_II.VN   not.want.IMP-PL
        ‘don’t write’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)
Instead of a verbal noun, the imperative may also combine with a future, as
in (131) below(131)   afi-n-e               manefi
        take_II-N1SG-FUT      not.want.IMP[SG]
        ‘don’t take’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
Drabbe remarks that the future suffix -e bears no stress, and therefore is
often elided (‘cannot be heard’). We find an example of this in one of the
texts, presented here as (132). Note, by the way, how the verb manefi takes
the entire series of preceding verbs as it complement.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                          117(132)      osubu          küobu         ku              adin’ 86               manefi
           osu-bu         küo-bu        ku              adi-n=e                manefi
           go.up-SS       carve-SS      palm.shoot      eat_II-N1SG=FUT        not.want.IMP[SG]
           ‘don't go up and carve and eat the youngest shoot of the stem’ (3.050)
Although not mentioned explicitly by Drabbe, (133) below shows that mũ
can combine not only with finite, but also with semifinite irrealis verbs (the
future — finite by definition — would be oxenan(e) instead of oxenã.)(133)      em’           ob’         oxenã                   mafioxone
           em=           o-bu        o-xe-nã                 mafi-oxone
           then          speak-SS    speak-N1.RLS-N1PL       not.want.IMP-PL
           ‘then don’t speak about it’ (5.28)2.6 Negation
Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 8-9; section 29, p. 14; sections 42-44, p. 16-17In 2.3.2.2 (example (48), repeated here as (134)), it was shown how verbal
nouns are used in the negation of past and present events:(134)     joxo      de         baxe-n=de          xo
          3PL       LOC        sit_II-VN=NEG      COP
          ‘they are not here’ (Drabbe 1957:16a)
An alternative way of negating past and present events is by the use of
semifinite or finite realis forms, again followed by de xo NEG COP, with
final stress of the verb shifting to the negator de. The verbs are optionally
preceded by fede. Consider the following example.(135)      (fede) da-de=dè                  xo
           (NEG) come-1SG.RLS=NEG            COP
86
     Note that the form adin(e) differs from the verbal noun adĩ and from the (homophonous)
semifinite irrealis N1SG form adĩ.
118                                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs        ‘I didn’t come’ (Drabbe: 1957:17)
In cases like this, one could state that the entire clause is predicated over
and negated. We have a complete verbal clause dade ‘I come’, which is
embedded in a negative clause. The syntactic and semantic structure of this
clause (not considering fede) could be rendered as follows:Syntactic structure       [[dade]VERBAL CLAUSE =dè   xo ]NEGATIVE CLAUSE
Semantic structure        [[I come]          it is not] -> ‘It is not (the case that): I
                                                                 come’
Figure 7: verbal clause embedded in a negative clause
It should be noted that the negator is syntactically independent of the verb.
Therefore this book deviates from Drabbe, in rendering the formative =de
as a clitic instead of a suffix. The form of verb +clitic is fully regular, with
autonomous nasals rendered as n before =de, as in (semifinite realis:) da-d-
oan=dè [come-1.RLS-1PL=NEG] ‘we come’, so that we get the following
paradigms:Table 25: Negation of realis verbs

Turning to verbal clauses headed by irrealis verbs, we see that the same
construction is used for the negation of a future event, but then with a
verbal clause headed by a finite future verb. Thus, we get the following
paradigm, again with autonomous nasals rendered as n before =de. The
future marker e has been elided, more on which can be found in note 88 at
Table 28 below.","[134, 135, 136, 137]"

Both the protasis and the apodosis are predicated by oxo. The copula oxo
that follows the protasis causes the stress of the immediately preceding verb
340                            PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations
to move to the penultimate syllable, and makes certain verb forms end in o
or u rather than e: for 1SG semifinite realis, -do or -du may be used instead
of -de, while the N1SG semifinite realis suffix -oxe alternates with oxo- (cf.
2.3.1.1). Another peculiarity is that the other N1SG semifinite forms are
followed by n, the function of which is unclear. 251 In this study n is
presented as part of the suffix, so that the n-final and vowel-final suffixes
are presented as allomorphs. Examples can be seen in (581) (baxen), (585)
(edoxòn) and (586) (küŋ-gen) below.","[357, 358]"
"
Finally consider Table 31, which shows verbs followed by the predicator-
question particle combination a xajo. Note that a is usually elided after
vowels, but merges with final e. Main stress is the same as for the
construction with =ka in Table 30 above, except from the historical past
forms, where stress is on the verb stem and not on -dia.

        ‘do you want to have it (lit. ‘will you accept it?’; Drabbe 1957:18a)
In the text corpus only one example of a verbal interrogative clause is
attested:(145)   Oxe:                   Kiawi,     gu      okag ̀mu          ièna

        ‘He says: “Kiawi, will you stay there?”’ (2.198)
In negative questions, the question particle ka or xajo follows the negative
particle de. Note that in this context we find xajo as a surface form, not *a
xajo, and that the copula xo — which is used in analogous positive clauses
— is not used. Drabbe gives the following two examples:

Drabbe 1957: sections 78-88, p.31-36Following Drabbe, who devotes 11 sections to the verbs ba(x) ‘sit’, e(k)
‘stand’, and i(g) ‘lie’, this book also devotes a separate section to the
discussion of posture verbs. Following a brief introduction about irregular
inflections, section 2.8.1 offers a discussion of the meaning and use of
posture verbs as lexical verbs. Section 2.8.2 shows instances where posture
verbs are developing into a copula, but where the meaning aspect of posture
is still part of their lexical entry. Section 2.8.3, finally, considers several
other types of verbs derived from posture verbs and their uses.","[144, 145, 146]"

"2.7 Verbs combined with polar question particles
    ka or a xajo
Drabbe 1957: section 17, page 9; section 45, page 17-18Parallel to what we saw for negative polarity in the previous section, polar
questions are also formed by the use of elements that have a predicative
function. The following table compares the strategies of forming polar
questions in nominal, adjectival and verbal clauses.

                                         ‘is it deep?’
It should be noted that in nominal and adjectival clauses =ka and a xajo do
not just mark a polar question, but are at the same time predicators over the
noun or over adjective. If we take this into account, the structure of the
polar questions formed with verbs is strikingly similar to the structure of
negative verbal clauses described in the previous section. Here too, the
verbal clause is embedded in another clause; the structure and semantics of
this construction could be rendered as in the following figure.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                      125Syntactic structure          [[dade]verbal clause      =ka / a xajo]interrogative clause
Semantic structure           [[I come]                 is it?] -> ‘Is it: I come?’
Figure 8: verbal clauses embedded in an interrogative clause
In the figure above, =ka has been rendered as a clitic and not — as is done
by Drabbe — as a suffix. This is to express that the formative is
syntactically independent from the verb that it follows, but probably
phonologically dependent, in that it seems to need a host to lean to. 89 It
follows the verbal or nominal clause, and is in free variation with a xajo.
Somewhat atypical for a clitic, however, it causes stress shift in the verb
that it attaches to, making the stress shift from the verbal suffix to the final
syllable of the root (cf. section 1.2.3). As can be seen in Table 30 below,
for semifinites and distant past forms stress shifts to the syllable preceding
the person-number marker; for historical past forms stress is on a in dia,
while in future forms stress shifts to the person-number markers.","[141, 142, 143]"
"
Examples of the use of future forms in the text corpus are restricted to a
handful of cases, all of which are presented here. The first example is found
in (73) below, which is a reaction to the question presented in (72) (for
question formation with a xajo see Table 31 in section 2.7). Note that both
the question clause and the declarative-affirmative clause are headed by
finite future forms: ièna and ieje, respectively.",[95]

Drabbe 1957: section 15, p. 8Numeral clauses are formed fully analogous to adjectival clauses, with
either oxo or de as a copula. Here too, in case the copula is de, the
predicative numeral can be marked for focus (by ke) or for nominative case
(by te), the latter only in case the subject is a larger animal or human. Thus,
in (481) the predicate can only be marked for focus, while in
also the nominative marker te can be used, in case reference is made to
humans or larger animals.(481)   kesaxe     okuoman      (ge / *te)       de

      nonexistence
Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 8-9Nonverbal clauses are negated by the use of clause final de xo ‘NEG COP’,
as in (483) and (484) below.(483)   nu        de        xo
        1SG       NEG       COP
        ‘it was not me’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)

        ‘it is not my father’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
Note that the negative particle de is homophonous with the copula de
discussed above; as set out in 3.6, both have developed from an emphatic
marker *de. Adjectival clauses are negated in the same way as nominal
clauses; an example is given in (485). Drabbe does not discuss the negation
of numeral clauses.(485)   na        n-api             koan        de         xo
        1SG       LNK-mother        strong      NEG        COP
        ‘my mother is not strong’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
Non-existence or a non-being present in a certain location is expressed by
fede xo. Consider (486) and (487) below, the former of which forms a
minimal pair with (483).
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                           291(486)   nu       fede      xo

        ‘there is no sago’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)
The example below has been taken from the text corpus.","[307, 308, 309]"
"
As the text corpus does not contain any counterfactual conditional
sentences, all we can do here is sum up the examples provided by Drabbe.
Examples (581) through (585) are examples of conditional sentences with a
positive protasis.(581)       xofe      te        neto        ato-sum-òxo             fini    oxo

      Drabbe suggests that it might be analyzed as a linking element, which however one does
not seem to need after the distant and historical past forms (Drabbe 1957:23a).

           1957:23a)
(586) and (587), on the other hand, are examples with a negative protasis.(586)      ato-sumù-du                    fede      kì-ke                      fini   oxo

252
      As was stated in 2.3.3.1, some verbs in o have a lengthened ā in N1SG realis finite
forms. Thus, xāki is derived from xo ‘go’.

Finally consider the following two examples with a negative clause in the
apodosis, the first of which also has a negative protasis. The negative
apodosis has the same structure as a normal negative main clause, which
was discussed in 2.6.(588)   wi      ti-nu              fede    kì-ke                 fini    oxo

        ‘if he had warned, we would not have been angry’ (Drabbe 1957:23b)5.6 Tail-head linkageAs is common in many Papuan languages, Awyu-Dumut languages make
elaborate use of tail-head linkage. In this discourse strategy, the last clause
of a clause chain or sentence is partially or completely repeated at the
beginning of the next clause chain (cf. de Vries 2005:363). Consider the
passage below, which illustrates a number of important principles.","[358, 359, 360]"
"62 This is confirmed by what Drabbe writes when dealing with the use of future in
negative volitionals (Drabbe 1957:16, cf. also the end of section 2.6, and the examples
(35), (54a) and (56a), to which we referred in 2.3.3.2 above). Here he points out that the
future is also used in other “subjective utterances”, e.g. in xamiki fime-je [true
think_II[1SG]-FUT ] ‘I believe it is true’. Interestingly, it is precisely the more subjective
moods which according to Dik operate at the level of the entire proposition. Compare also
2.127.

2.4 Aspect
Drabbe 1957: sections 53-57; p.21-23Although the term ‘aspect’ has not been used in this chapter yet, we have
come across a number of constructions that have a modal or aspectual
function, all of them formed with the irrealis infinitive plus an auxiliary.
Both inflected mV ‘do’ plus irrealis verbal noun (2.3.2.2.5) and oxo / ki(k)
‘PRED’ / become plus augmented irrealis verbal noun (2.3.2.3.1) may
express prospective aspect, expressing that an event is about to take place.
The former section also discussed fixed expressions that are used for the
expression of a state. In the present section we discuss some other aspectual
categories that are expressed in Aghu. First, attention will be given to
categories that are expressed by morphological means: iterative aspect
(2.4.1), habitual aspect (2.4.2) and durative aspect (2.4.3.1, also 2.4.3.4).
Then the focus will switch to lexical and analytical ways of expressing
durative aspect (2.4.3.2 and 2.4.3.3), or continuative aspect (2.4.3.5), while
morphological expression of continuative aspect is discussed in (2.4.3.4).","[98, 99]"
"
A clause can be defined as “the linguistic expression of a proposition”
(Payne 1997:71). In the present study, a verbal clause may contain
maximally one inflected verb: a nonfinite, semifinite or fully finite verb.
Sequences of verbs within one sentence are referred to as ‘clause chains’ or
even sequences of clause chains, more on which can be found in Chapter 5.
The first section of this chapter discusses verbal clauses (with the exception
of those headed by the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’), while the second
section deals with nonverbal clauses: nominal, adjectival and numeral
clauses. The second section closes with a section on clauses headed by the
copula verb ki(k). The remainder of the chapter will deal with a number of
other phenomena that operate at clause level. Section 4.6, finally, will
summarize the similarities and differences between the types of clauses that
were discussed: verbal and non-verbal positive, negative and question
clauses.",[289]

In negative sentences, on the other hand, we find a somewhat different
relation between form and mood or modality. As can be seen in the
rightmost column of the table above, we have dedicated forms or
constructions for declarative, volitive and optative readings. The rest of this
section will first discuss form and function of the finite forms, then come to
the form and function of the semifinite forms with =kuoxo and close off

"In the section where Drabbe describes the use of predicative de after verbs
he also points to the use of mV ‘do’ as a predicator. The verb can be used
to predicate over adjectives and nouns. This is illustrated in (529) and
(530). Compared to ‘normal’ predication with de or oxo described in 4.2.1
and 4.2.2 above, the use of m-oxo plus copulative de emphasizes a
causative relation between the respective clause and the following:(529)   oxo      tadixa    m-oxo                 de      onu-d-oan=de            xo

In line with what was described for de in 4.3, here too it is possible to
embed a verbal clause. This is illustrated in (531) and (532).

First consider question clauses, formed either by a combination of copula a
and question maker xajo or by a single question copula ka. Note that —
analogous to what we saw for the use of moxo de in 4.4 above — the
verbal clause fills the same structural slot as a nominal or adjectival phrase.","[321, 322, 323]"

Fe '3SG' refers to one sack of sago; later on this is mentioned

In section 2.5 it is described that imperatives cannot be negated, and
that the imperative forms of mũ 'not.want' are used (usually combined
with a verbal noun or a future) as a way to form negative commands. Here
Drabbe writes in a note that 'do not want', should be taken as 'do not
get angry' (Drabbe 1957ː85, note 41). For the use of mũ see also the end
of section 2.6 on negation.","[559, 560]"

Papuan languages to have personal or possessive pronouns that are tightly interwoven with
kinship terms was already noted by Drabbe (1950:101), and gives an anthropological
explanation: “in Awyu-Dumut languages, kinship terms express a dyadic relationship.
They do not refer to one person, as such, but to the relationship in which that person stands
to the speaker or another person (Stasch 2009:72). Awyu-Dumut kinship terms are not
inherently possessed, but it is rare for a kinship term to occur without the ‘possessor’ of
that particular kin being named” (Wester 2014: 56-57).
120
      From Drabbe’s description it is not clear whether contracted forms exist for all kinship
nouns, or only for a subset.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                               159
Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:(186)       efe       n-eto             efe         n-amoko
            3SG       LNK-father        3SG         LNK-son
            ‘father and son’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)

            ‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)
It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:(189)       ãŋ           go        ku
            woman        and       man

Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to
160                        PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
make clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,
men.””121
Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.","[176, 177, 178]"

2.3.2.3.1 Predication with oxo or ki for expressing be about to
Drabbe 1957: section 35, p. 15bThe augmented verbal noun can form a predicate in combination with oxo
or ki, parallel to what was described for the non-augmented infinitive
above. Compared to the analogous construction with the non-augmented
verbal nouns, which expresses a state, the augmented verbal noun adds the
meaning aspect of being about to enter into a state. According to Drabbe,
the meaning is the same as the meaning of inflected auxiliary mV ‘do’ plus
non-augmented verbal noun described in 2.3.2.2.5 above. He gives the
following three examples. In constructions with ki(k) ‘become’, the verb
ki(k) should be taken as ‘getting into the state of’, so that the predicate in a
sentence like (59) should be understood as ‘getting into a state of almost
dying’.(58)   nügu    te      axin-à           oxo

Drabbe 1957: section 36, p. 15bThe negative counterpart of the construction above is formed with de (o)xo.
Drabbe describes the meaning as a ‘not being able to’, and gives the
following two examples.(61)       nu      agemen-à                de          xo

semifinite verbs by the presence of tense markers. Stems of type I can be
specified for different past tenses, while stems of type II can be specified
for future tense.

"2.11 Mũ not want
Drabbe 1957: section 90, p. 36a-bThe verb mũ 'not want' has been mentioned at several places in this chapter.
In 2.3.2.2 it was introduced as heading a verbal noun. In the same section,
as well as in 2.5, we saw the imperative forms of mũ used in the expression
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                      143
of negative commands. The form was also mentioned in section 2.6 on
negation. Here we want to focus on the nonfinite form munuk, a form about
which Drabbe writes that “in Dutch one very often translates as ‘after’, and
which often does not mean more than that.” 106 Consider the following
examples:(173)      Soxo       kunuk           munuk                   büsiü      daxenã.

           ‘He gives them [the valuables], his wife takes them and after this flies
           away.’ (6.129)
In the examples above, the sense of ‘not wanting (anymore)’ fades into a
‘not continuing with’. Although Drabbe’s remark might be taken as an
indication that the form has grammaticalized into an adverb, there are
insufficient reasons to analyze the form as such. In all the examples, the
form can still be analyzed as a same-subject nonfinite verb form, as it is
virtually always followed by a verb with the same subject as the subject of
mũ. This suggests that this is still a grammatical requirement, which
directly follows from the analysis of munuk as a nonfinite SS-form.","[160, 161]"

5 Clause combinations
5.1 Sentences as combinations of clauses or clause
    chainsIf we study the text corpus as published in Drabbe (1957), it is clear that for
Drabbe, Aghu clauses generally combine into larger units: A sentence,
marked by a capital at the beginning and a full stop in the end, often
comprises more than one clause. Some sentences are subdivided
orthographically into smaller units by the use of semicolons or comma’s.
Although Drabbe’s (1957) description lacks an explanation of the use of
diacritic signs, I assume that semicolons and commas generally refer to the
presence of a pause in the spoken text, probably going along with a certain
intonational pattern.219 We do not have any information, however, on the
type of intonational pattern(s) going with these pauses, and neither do we
know what motivated Drabbe’s choice between a full stop, a comma, or a
semicolon. For reasons to be explained below, we will refer to the units
demarcated by Drabbe that consist of more than one clause as clause
chains. This can be represented as follows:
219
      I admit, however, that one cannot exclude the possibility that Drabbe was led (also) by
the logical relations holding between sentence parts, rather than by intonational patterns.

The quote above summarizes the main point: clauses headed by less
inflected verbs depend for their interpretation on the next fully inflected
verb to their right, but are at the same time not a constituent of the clause
containing the fully inflected verb. Following Foley (2010), these clauses
are probably better characterized as coordinate rather than subordinate.223223
      It is not so easy to prove, however, that the dependent clauses in Aghu are coordinate
rather than subordinate. According to Foley (2010), subordinate clauses are always
constituents of the main clause: either as a core argument, in which case they are
complement clauses; or as oblique arguments, in which case they are adverbial subordinate
clauses, or as modifier of a nominal constituent, in which case they are relative clauses.
One could state, therefore, that subordinate clauses, are ‘nominalized’, or — generally —
formally marked as noun phrases.
While in certain other Awyu-Dumut languages dependent clauses can be contrasted with
subordinate structures in which the clause is nominalized (cf. Wester 2014: 158 f.; de Vries
2005:372-377), this is not the case in Aghu; it is impossible to use language-internal
criteria to contrast the dependent clauses under discussion here with subordinate clauses.
Still, it makes more sense to consider them coordinate rather than subordinate. The main
reasons for this are the following: (1) There is simply no evidence that the clauses are
embedded in the following clause with fully inflected verb, and there is no evidence that
the clauses are nominalized (unless we follow Drabbe’s analysis of ke, see below); (2)
Drabbe never translates the dependent clauses in Aghu as complement clauses or relative
clauses, which — as stated by Foley 2010:32 — are typical functions of subordinate
clauses in Papuan languages. Although it is true that translations can never be taken as
evidence for the existence or non-existence of a certain grammatical construction, I
nevertheless believe that the total lack of relative and complement clauses in the Dutch
translation is telling; (3) although Drabbe refers to the nonfinite forms as deelwoorden

5.4 Aghu and switch referenceAs stated in the previous section, switch reference systems typically appear
in clause-chaining languages. As argued in de Vries (2010), who modifies a
theory set out in in Haiman and Munro (1983), clause chaining structures
are the result of coordination reduction in thematic continuity conditions,
where the basic principle is that those operators that are consistent over the
clauses are marked only on the verb of the final clause. De Vries shows
how, for Dumut languages, reduction took place in a diachronic process, in
cases where the operators of tense, mood and subject of a series of clauses
were continuous. In this process, verbs in SS conditions were the first to be
reduced and to become part of a chaining structure. Present Dumut
languages show the traces of this diachronic process: All Dumut languages
have dedicated nonfinite SS forms, which lack a specification for tense,
mood and person, while only some have dedicated DS forms. These DS
forms have grown from the non-reduced forms when used as non-final verb
in a series of clauses; as the use of reduced forms was restricted to SS
conditions, the non-reduced forms came to be associated with DS conditions.
In Dumut languages, then, we find (apart from the tensed forms which
(‘participles’), he places the words in apostrophes to show that they are different from
participles. The difference may very well be that participles are embedded while nonfinites
are not; (4) There are very clear cases where nonfinite clauses present foreground
information, e.g. in the durative constructions discussed in Durative aspect expressed by
constructions with posture verbs and at the end of 5.4.1.1. This is very unusual for
subordinate structures (cf. Dooley 2010). With regard to the first point, it should be noted
that the connective =k that is optionally used after nonfinites is considered by Drabbe the
same as the oblique marker ke used after nouns. Although it cannot be excluded that there
is a diachronic connection between the two particles, I believe that the two particles
synchronically have very different functions. The use of =k after nonfinite verbs cannot
be used, therefore, as an argument that the nonfinite clause would have been nominalized,
and that it would, therefore, be in a subordinate relation to the final clause.
314                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations
largely function at discourse level, as in Aghu) reduced SS forms, and less
reduced semifinite verbs functioning in DS conditions.224
Coming back to Aghu, we find a somewhat paradoxical situation. On the
one hand, we find switch reference expressed in a way that is very much in
line with the patterns described above. We find a very frequent use of
reduced nonfinite forms in SS conditions, described in 5.4.1.1, while the less
reduced semifinite forms are used predominantly in DS conditions, as
described in 5.4.1.2. This system is very similar to the situation in South
Wambon, which de Vries characterizes as representing the first stage of a
development towards dedicated switch reference systems (de Vries
2010:345). On the other hand, switch reference can also be expressed by
the addition of suffixes to the less-reduced semifinite forms, a system that is
described in 5.4.2. Although this system is discussed by Drabbe rather
extensively, the text corpus contains very few examples of the use of the
respective affixes. The affixes express both switch reference and
sequentiality. The system is very different from the system discussed above,
because neither the SS nor the DS forms are reduced forms. On the contrary,
switch reference forms are more complex than ‘normal’ verbs, as they
result from the addition of suffixes.","[330, 331, 332]"

3.10.2              Numeral verbs
Drabbe 1957: section 73, p. 29a-bNumeral verbs are derived from numerals by the addition of the suffix -mV
‘do’. Verbs based on numerals in -mu do not get an additional suffix -mV,
but are inflected like the other -mV final (numeral) verbs, with -oxe as the
N1.RLS       marker, cf. section 2.3.1.1. Numeral verbs are used for the
expression of duration in terms of nights, months or hours, or in
combination with goŋgõ ‘time(s)’. As Drabbe only gives examples for the
numerals 1 through 5, it is not clear whether verbalization is also possible
for numbers higher than 5.(426)     xodok           womĩ      okuom-oxe-nã

          ‘he died four days ago’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
While (426) and (427) above have been formed with the use of a nonfinite
realis verb, we find analogous constructions with a nonfinite irrealis verb,
or — in other words — a verbal noun (cf. 2.3.2.2):(433)    agufẽ          womĩ        okuom-oxe-nã
         seek_II.VN     night       do.two-N1.RLS-N1PL

         ‘they were building the house during four months’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
The combination with goŋgõ ‘time(s)’ expresses how many times a certain
event is taking place. Note that here too speakers may use both a nonfinite
realis form (as in (435)), or a verbal noun (which is a nonfinite irrealis
form, cf. 2.3.2.2.)

          ‘I came four times’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)3.11 Copulas de and oxoAs will be set out in Chapter 4, Aghu has two copulas: de is used as a
copula in nominal, adjectival or numeral clauses, while the use of oxo is
restricted to adjectival and numeral clauses. De is homophonous with the
negation particle de, discussed in 2.6, and with a locative particle de,
mentioned briefly in 3.4.2. I will follow up on Wester’s suggestion that the
negator de and the copula de both derive from an emphatic marker de
(Wester 2014: 127-128),193 and would like to suggest that also locative de
derives from the use of de as an emphatic copula. The development from a
copula into a locative may have taken place via a cleft construction, along a
path illustrated in the examples below:
193
      Wester speaks of ‘an emphatic marker de with copula function in Aghu’, but does not
make explicit why she considers it as emphatic; Drabbe refers to de in these cases as a
predicative element, and never speaks about emphasis. That de used to have an emphatic
function, however, is rather likely. First, the element is found as an emphatic marker with
copular function in the related Awyu languages Pisa and Shiaxa. In addition, both the
development from emphatic markers into negative markers and from negative markers into
copulas have been described in the literature. The first development is mentioned by Croft
1991:5 (as cited in Wester 2014:128), while the development from emphatic markers to
copula markers is suggested by Pustet (2003:59), who writes that “another hint at the
origin of copulas lies in the fact that copulas are sometimes homonymous with elements
conveying certain pragmatic notions, such as emphasis.”
270                           PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes(437)        napi        de            ba-xe

             ‘my mother is there’ (Drabbe 1957:32b)
(438)        de       ba-xe
             LOC      sit-N1.RLS[SG]
             ‘(s)he is sitting (there)’ (based on Drabbe 1957:32b)
It should be noted that Drabbe describes de in both cases as a locative
marker. I would like to suggest, however, that examples like (437) above
may have originally started out as cleft constructions with an emphatic-
copula de, and would originally better have been translated as ‘it is mother
who is sitting there’, with napi ‘mother’ as a ‘focused subject’, or — more
strictly formulated: a focused NP coreferent with the implicit subject of
baxe. In the course of time, the emphatic function of de bleached, after
which it was reinterpreted as an adverbial locative marker, and could also
be used in contexts without a ‘focused subject’, as in (438).194,195
The copula oxo is found not only in adjectival or numeral clauses, but also
in the following contexts:
       -   In negative sentences, following a verbal noun or a semifinite form,
           described in 2.3.2.2.2 and 2.6, respectively;
       -   In combination with a verbal noun in ã, described in 2.3.2.3;
       -   In counterfactual conditional sentences, described in 5.2.","[284, 285, 286, 287, 288]"
"“There is another desire which, unfortunately, also this time we couldn’t fulfill. One would
want us to provide many and exact phonetic data about the languages whose grammatical
structure we analyze and describe; ideally, one would like to see these data accompanied
by an analysis of the phonological structure. We fully acknowledge this desire as justified,
but are not capable to meet this desire, as we know that we are not competent. Although it
is, in principle, possible to learn what one does not know, given our age and the amount of
work it would take to do such a study, which — if one wants it to lead to the desired
results — would take a lot of time, we think we serve the interests of our mission — our
primary aim — better if we spend the rest of the time that will be given to us in the same
way as before. Although we acknowledge the desire mentioned above as justified, and
although we acknowledge that our work will also in the future, seen from a scientific
perspective, contain a gap, we are nevertheless of the opinion — and we are not alone in
this — that our labour is not without merit for linguistics.”22
    “Aan een andere wens konden we helaas ook ditmaal niet voldoen. Men zou gaarne zien, dat we in
ruime mate exacte fonetische gegevens verstrekten over de talen, waarvan we de grammaticale
grondstructuur ontleden en beschrijven; liefst zou men deze gegevens nog vergezeld zien gaan van
een analyse der fonologische structuur. We erkennen ten volle het rechtmatige van dit verlangen,
maar zijn niet bij machte eraan tegemoet te komen, daar we ons incompetent weten. Weliswaar kan
men leren wat men niet weet, doch gezien enerzijds onze leeftijd en anderzijds de omvang van een
dergelijke studie, die — wil ze tot de gewenste resultaten leiden — geruime tijd in beslag zou nemen,
menen we de belangen van het missiewerk — ons eerste doel — beter te dienen, door de tijd die ons
nog geschonken zal worden, te besteden als voorheen. Het rechtmatige van bovengenoemd verlangen
erkennend, en toegevend, dat ons werk ook in de toekomst, van wetenschappelijk standpunt bekeken,
een lacune zal blijven vertonen, menen we toch — en we staan daarin niet alleen — dat onze arbeid
niet zonder waarde is voor de taalwetenschap.” (Drabbe 1957:iii)
viDrabbe concludes his preface with the following words:“Where our opponent [Prof E.M. Ühlenbeck] rightly signals the lack of exact phonetic
signs as a lacuna in our work — but, in our opinion, values this too highly — his judgment
should be explained not out of prejudice or bias, but out of his great enthusiasm for
structural linguistics. We can fully appreciate this enthusiasm, as we too consider a
structural analysis to be necessary, if one really wants to bring all secrets of a language to
the surface of conscious knowledge. We would therefore be delighted if the work, with
which we only made a beginning, would, in this spirit, be brought to completion by
others.”3
Although this book does not work within the paradigm of structural
linguistics that was current in the Fifties, it shares the same enthusiasm to
bring all secrets of the Aghu language, as hidden in this Spraakkunst, to the
surface. Not only to be seen by those who are competent in Dutch or those
who manage to get hold of a copy, but by all those who, with Drabbe,
would like to know more about this language, because“Each language is a fascinating miracle, and because it is an intense joy to analyze
such a miracle, as one repeatedly does new and unexpected discoveries.” 4
3
    Waar onze opponent het ontbreken van exacte fonetische gegevens terecht signaleert als een lacune
in ons werk, doch naar onze mening dit al te zwaar laat wegen, moet zijn oordeel verklaard worden
niet uit vooringenomenheid of partijdigheid, maar uit zijn grote enthousiasme voor de structurele
taalwetenschap, een enthousiasme, dat we ten volle kunnen waarderen, omdat ook wij een structurele
analyse als noodzakelijk beschouwen, wil men uiteindelijk erin slagen alle geheimen van een taal aan
de oppervlakte der bewuste kennis te brengen. Het zou ons dan ook ten zeerste verheugen, wanneer
anderen de arbeid, waarmede wij slechts een aanvang maakten, in deze geest zouden kunnen
voltooien” (Drabbe 1957:iv).

    “…[omdat] iedere taal een boeiend wonder is, en het een intens genoegen is zo een wonder te
ontleden, doordat men telkens nieuwe en onverwachte ontdekkingen doet” (Drabbe 1965: 27).

This book and Drabbe s Spraakkunst
The present book can be seen as an adaptation of Drabbe’s 1957
Spraakkunst van het Aghu-dialect van de Awju-taal. It is intended to make
the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

      Dixon stresses that case may be expressed in different ways: either as affixes (ideally
and typically called case inflection, or as clitics (ideally called case clitics, typically called
case or apposition), or — as is the case in Aghu — as grammatical words, in which case
they are ideally called case words, and typically called adpositions. This book uses the
term postpositional case marker, to express both its realization as a grammatical word that
directly follows the NP and to express its function as a case marker.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                       241Table 49: Postpositional case markers and their function178
te ‘NOM’                  Nominative case marker, used to mark a subject
ke(mu) ‘ACC’              Accusative case marker, used to mark a patient, recipient,
                          target, location or (certain) temporal expressions
ni ‘DAT’                  Dative case marker, used e.g. to mark a beneficiary, a
                          purpose, an addressee (but see below), or a non-patient-like
                          complement of certain verbs
fini / namu ‘INSTR’       Instrumental case marker, used to mark an instrument or
                          source material. Also used in certain temporal expressions
kumu ‘COM’                Comitative case marker
Before coming to a one by one discussion, it is helpful to first give some
general properties of the postpositional case markers listed above, to
delineate them from members of other word classes. The defining
properties of the markers above are the following:
       -   They appear in final position of the phrase.
       -   They mark the syntactic or semantic relation between the noun
           phrase and the verbal predicate.
       -   Their use is generally optional, at least in certain contexts.179178
      In his discussion of “schakelelementen” Drabbe also mentions maga, used only in
combination with to ‘opening’ (Drabbe 1957:43a). To maga, then, is translated by Drabbe
as ‘in the opening’ or ‘at the door’. This maga is probably better analyzed as spatial noun
(3.5.2), rather than as a postpositional case marker.
179
      Here we are limited because of a lack of data, and suffer especially from the lack of
data obtained from independent fieldwork. One of the most straightforward ways to find
out whether a morpheme is optional, is to present an informant with both options, and ask
for the acceptability and meaning of both cases. Given that we lack this type of data, we
may conclude that the use of a morpheme is optional only in those cases where Drabbe´s
corpus happens to provide contrasting examples. And even then we do not know whether
there might be a subtle meaning difference going along with the use or non-use of the
morpheme in question.
242                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
The case markers te and ke were dealt with in 3.1.7, where it was shown
that they answer all three criteria mentioned here: they are used
postnominally, they mark the (semantic or) syntactic relation between the
predicate and the noun, and their use is optional. We now turn to a
discussion of the other postpositional case markers.","[258, 259, 260]"

2.4.3.2 Durative aspect expressed by use of particle bu
Drabbe 1957: section 54, p. 21-22An alternative way of expressing durative aspect is by the use of a particle
bu — often cliticized as b= before vowels, and harmonizing with the
following vowel — in combination with a semifinite or finite verb, or with
one of the durative forms discussed in the previous section. The formative
bu usually directly precedes the verb, but it is not a prefix, as it can be
separated from the stem, as in (92) and (93).
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                            95(92)     b’asü              ki-ke

        ‘The next morning he is farting, he is farting loudly.’ (2.169)
Sentence (94) exemplifies the use of bu with a durative verb in -ke; (95) is
another example of bu used with a semifinite, while (96) and (97) illustrate
the use of bu with finite verbs, the latter of which also bears the durative
prefix i-.(94)    bu       dafi-naŋ-ge

        ‘a long while ago he was giving a speech for us’ (Drabbe 1957:22a)
Drabbe remarks that we very often find constructions like (94) and (96)
combined with the element awu, cliticized aw=, which means ‘already’, as
96                                          PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
in nu awu bu dafi-ke [1SG already DUR come_II[1SG]-DUR] ‘I am coming
already’. This is in line with Timberlake’s observation that the durative is
often used to express that an activity is going on ‘already’ or ‘sooner than
expected’ (Timberlake 2007:287). Another example is given with (98)
below. The sentence narrates how Apupüsimo’s daughter goes downhill,
after she has told him that there are people in his sago garden. When she
has gone downhill, she sees that these people are pounding ‘already’.","[112, 113, 114]"
"
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.  c      na        n-amse               ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child            give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                           301(524)      na         n-amse          te       da-xe-nã
           1SG.POS    LNK-child       NOM      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauses
                           te, analyzed as                   ke analyzed as
In subject position        Nominative case marker            Focus marker
As a complement            Nominative case marker            Focus marker
Considering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:
216
      An interesting example of the use of ke is found in 3.024, which was cited in 4.1 above,
example (452).","[318, 319]"
"
First, the majority of head clauses that pick up the tail clause of the
preceding clause chain or sentence are nonfinite SS forms, chained to the
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations                                        343
following clause.253 Examples are akusunuk in (591), kunuk in (595) and
günd in (596). This pattern is in line with the observation by de Vries that
“the default form of the recapitulated head clause follows from the default
or unmarked form of clause linkage in that language” (de Vries 2005:372;
2006:817). Another technique is to repeat the final verb of the tail literally,
something we see in the case of güŋge in (594). Third, it can be seen that
tail-head linkage is an optional and ‘creative’ process. In (592) we see that
the sequence of sentences that is linked by tail-head linkage is interrupted
by the semifinite verb akusuŋge, a form that was also used as the final verb
of (590). Following this, the verb onok in (593) picks up the tail of (591),
after which we find a further sequence of tail-head linked sentences. Not
illustrated here but attested elsewhere in the text corpus are cases where
also the object noun of a preceding sentence is repeated, or cases where the
last two clauses are repeated. 254 These phenomena show that tail-head
linkage should be seen as a discourse strategy or discourse preference,
rather than as part of sentence grammar (de Vries 2005:364).","[360, 361]"

discussed elsewhere, the language has a number of nominal adjuncts that
cannot be subsumed elsewhere. These are listed here.

generally linked asyndetically. This means that the use of conjunctions to
connect clauses is rare. Whether this is also true for noun phrases is hard to
say, as the text corpus does not contain examples of conjoined noun
phrases, neither asyndetically, nor syndetically. In Drabbe’s description,
however, we find a presentation of both NP conjoining and clause
conjoining conjunctions. These are presented in 3.8.1 and 3.8.2,
respectively.","[272, 273]"

"Very similar to the nonverbal clauses discussed in the previous session are
those which are formed with the use of the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’.
Following Dixon’s analysis of copula clauses, one could consider these
clauses as headed by a copula verb ki(k) which takes two complements: a
copula subject and a copula complement (Dixon 2010b:159f). This copula
can be a noun, an adjective or a numeral. Unlike the copula clauses
discussed above, the verb can be inflected not also for person and number
of the subject, but also for tense and mood, which makes that the clauses
under discussion here can also be used to invoke a future interpretation.
When combined with adjectives or numerals, the copula may be interpretednominal question clauses, namely by means of da xajo. Drabbe’s description contains no
examples, however.
211
      Drabbe does not refer to a as a copula, but as “possibly not more than a ligature”, and
refers to the use of a in questioning verbs (see 2.7).

    ending in de
Drabbe 1957: section 97, p39b-40aIn sections 2.6 and 2.7, it was shown how verbal clauses may be embedded
in an interrogative or negative non-verbal clause, by the use of a copulative
xo (a)xajo ‘QST’ or ka ‘QST’. Here I would like to discuss another example
of embedded clauses, namely those embedded in copula clauses ending in
de.212 Consider the following example:212
      Drabbe explicitly states that “predicative de” can only be used after semifinite (realis
and irrealis) forms, not after future forms. An example like (513) below, however, seems
to contradict his claim, as we do find an embedded future there.
296                              PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure(508)      o-xo                  de          da-de
           speak-N1.RLS[SG]      COP         come-1.RLS[SG]
           ‘I came because he asked me’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)
Drabbe contrasts the sentence above to (509) below, where one uses the
different-subject marker -ne. Compared to (509), sentence (508) stresses the
reason or the ground for coming: it is because he asked me that I came.(509)      o-xo-ne                    da-de
           speak-N1.RLS[SG]-DS        come-1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he asked me and I came’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)
I follow Drabbe in analyzing de as a copula.213 As the number of examples
given by Drabbe is limited, and as we have only few examples of this
construction in the text corpus, it is hard to characterize the precise function
of this construction. It can at least be said that speakers may embed verbal
clauses of different moods, including content questions. In (510)-(512) and
(515) we find realis verbal clauses (serving as an assertion), while (513) is
an example of an embedded irrealis. In (514) we have to do with a (realis)
content question (more on which will be said below). Example (516) and
(517), finally, are examples of embedded imperative clauses. In order to
clarify the structure of the clauses, I have given both a translation that
follows the Aghu structure quite closely, and a more liberal rendering.(510)     üfü-du           de          efe     wusoxo    xaimenaŋ   gi-ke

          ‘it is (because): I hit him and his body became painful’ ⇒ ‘his body is
          painful because I hit him’ Drabbe 1957:39b)
213
      Drabbe states literally that these sentences should be analyzed as verbal clauses thate
are “predicated again” by the use of de (Drabbe 1957:40)

298                              PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
In the text corpus, verbal clauses embedded in a clause ending in de are
few. A clear example is found in the myth on the two brothers, where the
younger brother commands his brother twice to let loose of his scrotum.(518)      nēxo,                midik                      ena             de
           n-ēxo                mi-di=k                    ena             de
           1SG-elder.brother     come.down-SS=CON           stand.IMP[SG]   COP
           ‘my elder brother, you [let loose and] come down and stand’ (3.140, repeated
           in 3.158)
In order to better grasp the function of embedding verbal clauses in copula
clauses ending in de, it is important to note that the copula here stands in a
paradigmatic relation with negative de xo ‘NEG COP’; with interrogative ka /
(a)xajo ‘QST’, and with counterfactual fini oxo ‘CFT COP’, more on which
can be found in 5.5.2. Especially informative is the contrast between open
questions and polar questions. Open questions begin with a question word,
and are optionally embedded in a copula clause ending in de, as illustrated
in (514) above, and (519) below. Closed or polar questions, however, are
embedded in clauses ending in ka or (a)xajo, as can be seen in (520)(519)     makum                axì-n-e          de
          how/where/when       go_II-N1SG-FUT   COP

          ‘(is it:) ‘he is coming’ ⇒ ‘is he going to come?’ (Drabbe 1957:17a)
Compared to polar questions, in which the entire state of affairs is
questioned, here we have a given state of affairs, in which it is one
information gap that is emphasized. 214 Two further examples of verbal214
      It should be noted that there is a fundamental difference between these two types of
predicates. The use of de implies that the event has taken place, is taking place, or is

the focus marker ke in (522), which might be here taken as implying a
contrast.(521)     ek’               üfü-oxe-nã

Onu(k) etc. ‘go across’ is used for crossing a water or other depth. It
optionally combines with afi ‘half’, which may be interpreted as ‘the other

side’ or ‘this side’ (where the deictic center is located), 170 dependent on the
use of a verb of going or a verb of coming (see below). Thus, for going
across one may use both onu(k) or afi onu(k). The following sentence
illustrates both.","[246, 247]"
"Elsewhere, Drabbe writes that ni is used in combination with a verbal noun

In my view, the meaning of the particle is best captured by considering it a
dative marker. The term ‘dative’ expresses the fact that the marker is used
for what one might call a-typical Patients. On the one hand, they are like
(typical) Patients, in that they are neither instigators of the event, nor is
their involvement in the event defined by by their being volitional or
sentient. On the other hand, they are atypical, because they are not affected
by the event.180 This is true for the verbs given by Drabbe (‘love’ and ‘be
afraid of’), and confirmed by the distribution of ni in the text corpus. There
we find ni used to mark the complement of agu ‘seek’ (8 attestations), to
mark the complement of dokũ ‘wait for’ (4 attestations), once to mark the
complement of ogo ‘go close to’ and once to mark the complement of o(x)
‘speak’; examples will be given below.","[260, 261]"

As stated above, nouns and noun phrases are generally not specified for
number. In line with Jakobson’s wording we may say that Aghu speakers
do not have to specify nouns and noun phrases for number. In these cases,
it is the linguistic or extralinguistic context which guides the interpretation.
Thus, in (190) and (191) it is knowledge of the world (that is: the
extralinguistic context) which makes that reference is made to a single
river, and to multiple fish traps.

In other contexts, it is not so much the extralinguistic but (also) the
linguistic context that guides the interpretation. In 3.1.5.2 below, we will
first consider cases where Noun Phrases are used as a subject, while 3.1.5.3
deals with cases where they have a different function in the clause. Before
we proceed on this, however, we first present a category of nouns with
dedicated plural forms.","[178, 179]"
"
194
      It should be noted that data are scarce at this point, however: Drabbe gives only one
example of a clause without an explicit ‘subject’. This example is similar to (, but has a
1SG verb form: de bade ‘I am sitting (there)’.
195
      The copula de may also be used with embedded verbal clauses, cf. 4.3.
4 Clause structure
This chapter discusses the structure of clauses. The focus of the chapter is
on main independent clauses: those clauses that can stand on their own, and
need not be followed by another clause in order to be grammatical; in Aghu
this category is formed by clauses headed by semifinite and finite verbs
(and nonverbal clauses). Some attention will also be given, however, to
clauses headed by nonfinite verbs. These clauses cannot stand on their own
and need to be followed by another clause in order to form a grammatical
sentence.","[288, 289]"
"
In Drabbe’ text edition, each sentence is accompanied by a morpheme by
morpheme glossing per sentence. Drabbe has also added short summaries in
Dutch, and a number of footnotes to the texts, because “it is very hard for
outsiders to get the general sense on the basis of a word-by-word translation
only” (Drabbe 1957: 56a). As is clear from Drabbe’s words above, he generally
did not find out the general meaning of the texts on his own, but discussed the
meaning of the texts with language helpers. In the present book, we see this
confirmed by a number of references to explanations that Drabbe got from his
language helpers. like “this is not so clear from the story, but the narrator
assures me that it was meant to say so”, cited in 7.025 below.355This quote, by
the way, shows that in this case (contrary to the quote above), the language
helper explaining the text was the one who had also told the story.",[450]
"
The locative marker de seems, therefore, mutually exclusive with focus on
the location. The same principle might explain why the locative marker is
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                       137
also lacking when posture verbs are combined with demonstratives, which
is the topic of this section. 100,101
Drabbe writes that the notion of ‘being present’ can be expressed by
combining a demonstrative element (nego ‘THIS’, xo ‘DST’ or ü ‘there’)
with the durative form of posture verbs. The demonstrative element directly
precedes the verb, and for a number of demonstrative-verb combinations
the language has developed contracted forms. Table 35 shows the forms for
combinations of posture verbs with nego ‘THIS’, where it should be noted
that nigi is used instead of nego.102
100
      This explanation is based on the assumption that there is a positive correlation between
demonstrative deixis and focus: demonstratives will usually be focused and therefore not
be followed by de. By frequency of association, what starts off as a tendency:
demonstratives are usually not followed by de, may grow into a grammatical restriction:
demonstratives cannot be followed by de, but directly precede the verb. That
demonstratives frequently precede the verb is proven by the existence of the contracted
forms under discussion here.
101
      It should be noted that locative verbs may easily bring along a focus on the clause as a
whole, which Lambrecht describes as ‘presentational’ or ‘thetic’ focus (1994: 141,
168,233). An example of a thetic focus in this context would be a sentence like ‘there’s
mother sitting there’, where the whole sentence is an assertion, or ‘new information’. In
order to decide whether the verbs under discussion here bring along this reading, however,
we would need examples of the use of these sentences in daily conversation.
102
      Although Drabbe might be right in his suggestion that nigi is a contracted form of nego
and the durative prefix -i, it is remarkable that except from here, durative i- and
durative -ke are never used simultaneously.

that forms of 1st person with ü ‘there’ or xo ‘over there’ ‘are not attested of
course’ [boldface mine, WvdH]. Apparently, the durative verbs under
discussion only allow for a present reading, or at least enforce that the
deictic center coincides with the present location of the speaker. If the
deictic center necessarily coincides with the position of the speaker, it is
inherently contradictory to state that ‘I am / (or: was?) (over) there’.103Table 36: Demonstrative ü ‘there’ combined with durative form of posture verb

In addition to the forms discussed so far, one also finds combinations of
posture verbs with the more complex demonstratives like xoto ‘uphill over
there’, xosü ‘down over there’, or xosu ‘up over there’ (see 3.2.4.1 for a103

3.8.1 Conjunctions conjoining noun phrases
Drabbe 1957: section 103f, p. 42bThe two conjunctions used to conjoin (nouns or) noun phrases are kini ‘or’
and ko ‘and’. In a series of conjoined elements, both kini and ko follow
each of the conjoined elements, as indicated in the following figure:
187
      The form is, most probably, historically related to amu ‘flesh’ or ‘meat’. Although it
should be distinguished from namu ‘WITH’, in many contexts stress on nàmu is not
realized, so that the two forms are formally undistinguishable (cf. 3.6.1.2 above).

In (403) through (405) we see the sentences given by Drabbe to illustrate
their use. First consider kini ‘or’, in (403). 188(403)     siü       kini,    fi            kini,     dü         kini       adìn-a              xajo

          ‘will you eat bananas, or tuber, or sago?’ (Drabbe 1957:42b)
The use of ko can be observed in (404), while (405) illustrates that ko is
also used to connect pronouns.(404)     efe      xasi     ko,      efe         dibisi   ko,        efe      tetabago   ko

Drabbe writes that Noun Phrases are sometimes also conjoined
asyndetically, but does not give any examples. As stated above, the text188
      From Drabbe’s description, it is not clear whether kini should be taken as disjunctive
(‘and /or’, so that the question reads as: bananas, and/or tuber, and/or sago) or exclusive
(‘or’, so that the parts are mutually exclusive: either bananas, or tuber, or sago).

corpus likewise lacks examples of conjoined Noun Phrases. As an
alternative to conjoined noun phrase, we find examples like (406) below.
There we can observe an asyndetic repetition of the same verb axe ‘he
takes’ with a different object: first xabü ‘stone axe’, and then motü ‘sack’.
This example is in line with a general tendency in Papuan languages to
limit the number of NP’s per clause, and to distribute nominals over
different clauses (cf. de Vries 2006:813).","[273, 274, 275]"

Note that the implication also seems to hold when the two verbs are
interrupted by a nonfinite verb, as long as they are part of the same clause
chain, as in (545):(545)      Panike                             amadadek                      jümoxe.

      only sporadically in the text corpus
5.4.2.1 Extensively discussed but rarely attested: suffixation
        with -ku expressing SS sequential
Drabbe (1957): sections 91-92, p. 36b-37The suffix -ku232 can be added to semifinite realis, semifinite irrealis forms,
or to imperatives. As such, it expresses not only ‘same subject’, but also
sequentiality. The use of -ku, in other words, indicates:
232
      One might want to argue that -ku and -ne are clitics rather than suffixes, because they
can be attached to a wider range of verbs than most affixes, to verbs that do not need this
final element in order to be a grammatical form. Both -ku and -nu cause stress shift like

      (ii)       That the event expressed by the following verb follows the event
                 of the verb to which -ku is attached.","[338, 339]"
"2.4.2 Habitual aspect
Drabbe section 56, p. 22-23Habitual aspect is expressed by the iterative stem plus another iterative
suffix -sumu. As some of the iterative stems are formed by means of the

same suffix, this may result in forms with a double suffix -sumu, as in the
following example, which contrasts the iterative with the habitual form of
the verb.(81)a    eto-sum-oxe.                        b       eto-sum-sum-oxe.
         see-IT-N1.RLS[SG]                           see-IT-IT-N1.RLS[SG]
         ‘he looked repeatedly’                      ‘he was used to look’ (Drabbe 1957:22b-23a)
Drabbe gives the following two additional examples to illustrate the
contrast.(82a)    fi-ogom-oxe                             b    fi-ogom-sum-oxe

        ‘He went time and time again’                   ‘He was used to go’ (Drabbe 1957:23a)
In the text corpus we find only one example of a habitual formation. This
example was given in 2.3.1.2 above and is repeated here:(84)    Enigomodok                etedek                     basumsumoxe.

        ‘It always sits, eating and watching.’ (9.08)2.4.3 Durative (progressive) aspect
In this book I follow Drabbe in his use of the term ‘durative’, except that I
use the term ‘continuative’ for the forms discussed in 2.4.3.4, which
express different degrees of longer duration. Apparently, for Drabbe the
term ‘durative’ (Dutch: duratief) doesn’t need any further explanation; for
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                    89
him it suffices to use the term and to translate durative verbs or
constructions with a Dutch present continuous.64
In order to describe the meaning of the durative forms and constructions in
Aghu, we follow Drabbe’s characterization plus translation of individual
examples, and study the use of duratives in texts (of which Drabbe gives
only translations for entire passages, and morpheme-to-morpheme glosses).
Doing so, we may describe the meaning and use of the durative as
follows:65
       -   The durative presents an event as an ‘ongoing activity’, and, by
           implication, as an activity with a certain duration.
       -   In all of the attested cases, durative forms are followed directly by a
           comma, semicolon or a full stop; they are, in other words, clause or
           sentence-final (cf. section 5.1 on the notions of clause and sentence).
       -   There is no implication of temporal overlap with the event
           expressed by a following predicate. It is the context which guides
           the interpretation at this point.","[105, 106, 107]"

224
      Languages differ in the extent to which the semifinite forms have developed into verbs
that can be used in DS — and, therefore, medial — conditions only. Mandobo is a language
where this is not the case: here ‘the presence of an independent semifinite verb form in
medial position signals switch-reference, with no formal differentiation between DS forms
and independent or final verbs’ (de Vries 2010: 345). North Wambon, on the other hand, is
a language that did develop dedicated DS forms, which can only be used in medial position
and signal DS.

5.4.1 Switch reference as attested in the text corpus
5.4.1.1 Nonfinite same-subject forms
Drabbe (1957): section 49, p. 19A brief look at one of the Aghu texts will convince the reader that nonfinite
SS forms are very common. As was stated in 2.3.2.1:
       1. Nonfinite verb forms never form the final verb of a clause chain;
       2.   The subject of the nonfinite verb is the same as the subject of the
            following verb. 225
Sequences of clauses with the same subject are typically expressed by a
sequence of nonfinite SS forms, with the final verb of the sentence formed
by a semifinite (or more rarely: finite) verb. Consider the following
sentence, where all nonfinite SS forms have been written in bold:(535)        Wo             xonok                 abu                dadek             büsiü

             ‘They collect sago grubs and bring them, take the sago grubs upwards to the
             house and eat (them), and the following day his mothers in turn stay, they stay
             at home.’ (1.092)
After a series of nonfinite forms, sharing the same subject, we find the
semifinite form eŋgena ‘they eat’. This semifinite form here closes off the
first clause chain. It is followed by a second clause within the same
sentence, in which we find a semifinite verb with a different subject: efe
napigi ‘his mothers’. This clause, finally, is followed by the final clause of
the sentence, which functions to specify the penultimate clause.226
Drabbe points out that SS forms can also be used when the (referent of the)
subject of the first clause is part of the (referents of the) subject of the
following clause. Drabbe gives the following example:(536)       Dü       afi      efe         küda              ede-de=k      ẽ-ge-nã.

            ‘She gave half of the sago to her younger sister and they ate.’ (Drabbe 1957:19a)
Comparable examples from the text corpus are given in (537) and (538)-
(539).227 In (537) we see that the subject of ededek, the older sister, also226
      This type of clause sequences will be the topic of section 5.4.3.
227
      The text corpus also contains an example, however, where we find an explicit DS-form
in such a situation, illustrated below:
Axene                           büsiü                xoxenã.

takes up the shot animal also participates in the cutting of the meat.","[332, 333, 334, 335]"
