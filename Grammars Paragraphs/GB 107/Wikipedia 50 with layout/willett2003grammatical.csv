                      7.6.3    Prohibitive
                               Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:179) describe the prohibitive as “a
                      negative command”.        Given this definition one might expect to find simply
                      imperative and negation marking as the morphological realization of prohibitives
                      in Nxa?amxcin.      This is not the case, however.      Prohibitive clauses do contain the
                      negative particle Jut, but there is no imperative marking.        Instead, predicates are
                      marked for irrealis mood.       Consider the following examples:

                      marking as described in H. Davis 2001.         The negation particle Jut appears at the
                      beginning of the clause followed by a nominalized predicate.            The nominalized
                     predicates in (206) to (208) are marked irrealis as required for prohibitive clauses.

                     Like (206) to (208), the above clauses contain both the negation particle Jut and
                     a predicate marked for irrealis mode. In (209) to (211), however, the predicate is
                     not nominalized.","[342, 343]"

                      7.5 Negation
                              Payne (1997:282) describes a negative clause as “one which asserts that
                      some event, situation, or state of affairs does not hold”. A pan-Salish analysis of
                      clausal negation has appeared in H. Davis 2001 where three major patterns of
                      negation are identified in the family. As H. Davis indicates, Nxa?amxcin
                      exemplifies two patterns.      Pattern A consists of a negative particle followed by a
                      nominalized clause, as shown in the following examples:
                      (157)   lat     —_—Pis?itn
                                      ?in-s-?itn

                              I didn’t eat.                                                              W.2.69
                      (158)   lit    ?isndw’lx
                                    ?in-s-naw’1x
                              NEG   2sPS-NM-run(sg.)
                              You didn’t run.                                                            W.2.86
                      (159)   lat   = nim’as       slémms
                                                   s-lom-m-s
                              NEG    anymore      NM-steal-m-3Ps
                              He doesn’t steal anymore.                                                  W.4.92
                     All three of the above clauses contain the negation particle Jut followed by a
                     nominalized predicate.      In addition, each of the three predicates in (157) to (159)
                     is marked by the nominalizer s- with subject marking expectedly appearing in the
                     form of possessive prefixes.
                              H. Davis’s pattern C involves the negation particle lut followed by an
                     unmarked indicative clause.       Some examples are given below:

                      7.8 Summary
                              In this chapter, I discussed various operations that place at the level of the
                      inflectional stem. In section 7.1 I outlined how person, number and grammatical
                      relation features are marked for intransitive subjects, transitive subjects and
                      objects, and possessive.     In section 7.2 I looked at two aspectual operations that
                      are relevant to viewpoint aspect:      perfective and imperfective aspect.         Section 7.3
                      briefly addressed the category mood, more specifically the operation marking
                      irrealis along with various particles used to mark potential, deontic and
                      probability.   Temporal markers indicating past and future were discussed in
                      section 7.4 followed by negation in 7.5. Three operations subsumed under the
                      label non-declarative—interrogative (yes/no questions), imperative and
                      prohibitive—are the focus of section 7.6. Finally nominalization, previously
                      discussed as a derivational operation in chapter 6, is considered as an inflectional
                      operation in section 7.7.
                              The following chapter addresses compound formation in Nxa?amxcin, a
                      process that takes place before any derivational or inflectional operations are
                      realized.",[348]

                             Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional classification of ‘polysynthetic’.
                     Words in polysynthetic languages are typically long and morphologically
                     complex, with a single word being able to express the full semantic content of a
                     complete sentence in a non-polysynthetic language.            As seems to be the case
                     with polysynthetic languages in general, Nxa?amxcin has obligatory pro-drop
                     for both subject and object position.       Thus, no subject or object pronouns are
                     overtly expressed, as shown in the following examples:8
                            8Views on clause structure in Salish languages are mainly divided into two
                     camps. The first supports the Pronominal Argument Hypothesis (e.g. Jelinek
                     1984, Jelinek and Demers 1994) according to which subject and object arguments

                     In the transitive construction in (52), the 2nd person sg. object is marked by the
                     suffix -si and the Ist sg. subject by the suffix -nn. No overt pronouns are present
                     to indicate these grammatical categories.        In example (53), the Ist person sg.
                     subject is marked by the intransitive clitic kn. Again, there is no overt intransitive
                      subject pronoun.
                             When overt noun phrases are expressed, the basic transitive word order is
                     VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order as shown in the following
                     examples:

                     are realized as pronominal elements on the predicate.          Overt noun phrases are
                     syntactic adjuncts coindexed with these pronominal elements. As adjuncts, these
                     noun phrases are able to maintain some freedom of word order. In the other camp
                     are researchers who support a configurational approach in which noun phrases
                     are themselves arguments coindexed with agreement morphology on the
                     predicate (e.g. Gardiner 1993, H. Davis 1999). I assume the latter analysis in this
                     work, although neither theoretical approach is crucial to the descriptive goals
                     pursued here.","[106, 107]"

                      7.6     Non-Declarative
                                In this section, I discuss three types of constructions that can be subsumed
                      together under the label non-declarative.             As Payne (1997:294) points out,
                      declarative clauses “simply assert information”.              This is typically the unmarked
                      clause in a language.         There are many other clause types that do not involve such
                      an assertion.      I discuss three of these below for Nxa?amxcin:             interrogatives
                      (yes/no questions), imperatives and prohibitives.",[337]

                             This dissertation is the first grammatical sketch of the Nxa’amxcin (Moses-
                     Columbian) language.        Nxa’amxcin is an endangered member of the Southern
                     Interior branch of the Salish language family, a linguistic group indigenous to the
                     Pacific Northwest region of North America.           Building on previous work by other
                      Salish linguists, I address to varying degrees all three major aspects of the
                     grammar (phonology, syntax and morphology) from a Lexeme-Morpheme Base
                     Morphology approach to word formation (Beard 1995).
                             A brief introduction to the phonology of Nxa’amxcin provides a look at
                     the segment inventory, the status of schwa, various segmental processes, and
                      syllable structure.    An overview of the syntax focuses on aspects of the noun
                     phrase—determiners, demonstratives, locative prepositions, genitive
                     marking—and the major clause types—simple clauses, relative clauses and
                      fronting.
                             An extensive discussion of lexical operations (derivational morphology)
                     addresses the categories of valence, voice, secondary aspect, control, category-
                     changing operations, and operations marking locative, augmentative, diminutive
                     and relational.     An overview of inflectional operations (inflectional morphology)
                     is presented starting with the marking of person, number and grammatical relation
                     on the predicate.      Viewpoint aspect, mood, temporal marking, negation, non-
                     declarative operations—yes/no questions, imperative, prohibitive—and
                     nominalization are also discussed.
                             A description of the three different types of compounds found in
                     Nxa’amxcin—two involving free stems and the third (known as lexical
                     affixation) comprising a free stem and a bound stem—is provided along with the
                     corresponding word structure rules responsible for these compounds.                  A number
                     of arguments in support of a compounding analysis of bound stem constructions
                     (lexical affixation), as opposed to a syntactic analysis, are presented.            The set of
                     classifiers that has developed from lexical affixation is also addressed.","[2, 3]"

                      8.1 What is a Compound?
                            Anderson (1992:292) defines a compound as “the combination of (two or
                      more) existing words into a new word”. Such a process, he claims, contrasts with
                      derivation and inflection which involve “the application of a Word Formation
                      Rule to a single existing word”.      A word formation rule, Anderson states,
                      “operates on a single word (or stem) to manipulate its phonological form
                      (typically, but not exclusively, by affixation) as well as its other properties.
                     Compounding, in contrast, involves the combining of stems from the lexicon into
                     a quasi-syntactic structure.”
                             While compound structures have been widely noted throughout the cross-
                     linguistic literature, the theoretical literature on compounds is relatively limited.
                     Fabb (1998:82), in his general overview of compounding, indicates that “{t]his is
                     because compounds tend to be less phonologically or morphologically active
                     than derived words, and less syntactically active than phrases: compounds are
                     relatively inert”.   The major theoretical work on compounds can be attributed to

                      DiSciullo and Williams (1987) and Anderson (1992), among others. For the
                      purposes of this work, I adopt Anderson’s (1992) analysis which is in line with
                      Selkirk’s (1982) work on compounds.!
                                Selkirk recognizes an “apparent need for particular rule statements; a
                      general X’ schema for compounding does not adequately characterize the
                      compounding possibilities found in English” (p.13). Anderson claims that
                      compounds are created by a set of word structure rules which “have much the
                      same form as phrase-structure rules, but apply only to lexical categories. Word
                      Structure Rules operate to specify the internal constituency of lexical categories
                      and (optionally) their heads” (p.299). Both Anderson and Selkirk agree that
                      these rules must be specific enough so as to rule out any gaps present in the
                      compounds of a language. Possible stem combinations as well as the feature of
                      “headedness” are very much language-specific, therefore what is available in the
                      grammar of a particular language should be encoded in its word structure rules.
                      For example, a compound of the lexical category verb comprising a verb stem and
                      a noun stem would be realized by the following Word Structure Rule:
                      dg)    VoOVN
                     The word structure rule in (1) indicates that a verb stem and a noun stem can
                     combine to form a single lexical item of the category verb. The head of the
                     compound is underlined.
                             The semantic interpretation of a compound is closely tied with the concept
                     of head.     As Selkirk (p.22) points out, “the nonhead constituent of the compound
                     in some way further defines the head; [...] the head is, intuitively speaking, the
                     nucleus of the compound”. For example, a nonhead can fill a role in the
                     argument structure of a head, but not the other way around.            Selkirk (p.22) notes,
                             1I should clarify that while Anderson’s view of compounding finds root in
                     Selkirk’s work on word structure, their views on derivation and inflection are
                     radically different in that Selkirk takes a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation while Anderson adopts a lexeme-based view.","[349, 350]"

                               In this chapter I presented a brief introduction to the syntax of
                     Nxa?amxcin. | first outlined the parts of speech, touching briefly on the
                      controversy surrounding lexical categories in Salish languages where some
                      scholars recognize a noun-verb distinction while others do not.            Adopting the
                     views of the former, I then moved on to a discussion of the noun phrase.                I
                     introduced the four determiners and three demonstratives that have been
                     identified for Nxa?amxcin, and then looked at oblique and locative prepositions.
                     In the final section on noun phrases, I reviewed the syntax of genitive phrases.
                               I then turned to the syntax of various types of clauses. I illustrated that
                      simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive, and the unmarked VOS for
                     transitive clauses, noting that there is some freedom of word order as VSO
                      constructions are also possible.     Relative clauses were examined with the data
                     illustrating that the relative clause head could either precede or follow the relative
                     clause.    In addition, relative clauses can be headless in Nxa?amxcin.             I then
                     looked at fronting constructions which involve the fronting of a NP/PP to pre-
                     predicate position. There are three types of fronting:         (i) unmarked; (ii) quasi-
                     clefting (the fronted argument is followed by a subordinating particle and the
                     residue has the surface form of a relative clause as it is preceded by an oblique
                     marker); and (iii) clefting (identical in structure to quasi-clefting except there is a
                     deteminer in lieu of a subordinating particle).
                               Finally, I looked at the properties and distribution of the particle wa, which
                     is prevalent throughout the Nxa?amxcin data.            On the surface it appears to mark
                     (optionally) absolutive arguments; however it is linked with the transitive subject
                     in topical object constructions.     Its position in fronting constructions is curious in
                     that when absolutive arguments (or subjects of topical object constructions) are
                     fronted, wa appears to mark the residue as opposed to the fronted NP.
                               Having looked at how Nxa?amxcin clause constructions are formed, in the
                     next three chapters I examine numerous processes involved in forming
                     Nxaramxcin words.        I start in the following chapter by discussing operations that
                     take place at the derivational stem level.","[130, 131]"

                      7.3.2   Potential
                             Potential mood expresses the potentiality of an event taking place. The
                      speaker indicates that something might happen or, at the very least, is capable of
                     happening. Potential mood is marked by several different particles in
                     Nxafamxcin. Two of these are mot and max”, which Kinkade (1981b:332)
                     glosses as ‘maybe’.!3       Some examples are given below:

                     features all function together as a unit, and this unit is identified with a particular
                     concept.       This is illustrated in the following examples for bake and -er
                     respectively:

                     The phonological, grammatical and semantic features of the morphemes bake and
                     -er are given in (la) and (1b) respectively.            The brackets show that these features
                     form an indivisible set, and it is this group of features as a whole that constitutes
                     the linguistic sign.
                              The final major assumption of a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation is that all morphemes are stored in the lexicon.            Since it was stated
                     above that both affixes and free forms are morphemes, it follows that both affixes
                     and free forms are stored in the lexicon. Thus, each of the morphemes bake and
                     -er would have their own entry in the lexicon.
                              The main point to be emphasized in this discussion is that free forms like
                     bake and affixes like -er have essentially the same status in a morpheme-based
                     model.        Both are morphemes, both are linguistic signs, and both originate in the
                     lexicon. In word formation there is only one kind of item, the morpheme, which is
                     stored in one place, the lexicon.      Thus, whether it is an independent stem like
                     bake or a bound affix like -er, both are signs and both are stored in the same
                     component.
                              Before moving on to a discussion of Lexeme-Morpheme Base
                     Morphology, it would be useful for the sake of comparison to give a visual
                     illustration of word formation within a morpheme-based theory.               Lieber (1992)
                     provides an excellent example as she clearly adopts all three of the above
                     assumptions.        Lieber (p.21) claims that “syntax and morphology are not separate

                     where words and sentences respectively are derived, or in the sense of being two
                     (at least partially) distinct sets of principles (Sproat 1985; Baker 1988[a])”.
                     Instead, she claims that both words and sentences can be formed within a single
                     modular framework with the appropriate principles. The formation of words can
                     be accounted for (with some modifications) within the X-bar framework proposed
                     for the formation of clauses by Jackendoff (1977), Chomsky (1981) and Stowell
                     (1981).    The position of a word’s head within this X-bar framework depends on
                     the parameter selected by a particular language (see Lieber 1992, chapter 3). X-
                     bar theory provides the modular framework for word formation, but it is not
                     enough as Lieber (p.77) states:
                               [...] X-bar theory alone cannot account for everything that is relevant in
                               the construction of complex words. X-bar theory determines the position
                               of the head in words and sentences, but it says nothing about the actual
                               mechanism that effects labeling of nodes within words, that is, the process
                               by which categorial information and other features are projected up from
                               lexical entries to produce fully labeled word structures.
                     In order for the appropriate features to be passed on from one node to another
                     within the X-bar framework, Lieber proposes two distinct processes.                 The first,
                     which is the one of most interest in this discussion, is feature percolation.              This
                     process allows for the morphosytntactic features of the head to “percolate” up to
                     the dominant node.      The second process, which I do not address here, is
                     inheritance, which ensures that argument structures are passed on from one node
                     to another.
                               This condensed discussion of Lieber 1992 should provide enough
                     background to explain how a word like bakers is formed within this morpheme-
                     based framework.      In line with the major assumptions of a morpheme-based
                     theory outlined above, Lieber assumes that the forms bake, -er and -s are all
                     morphemes and that they all constitute linguistic signs, as indicated in (1). In
                     addition, each of these forms has its own entry in the lexicon.          Since all of these
                     are considered to be signs, and signs are comprised of indivisible features, all
                     idiosyncratic phonological, grammatical and semantic features are part of this
                     entry.","[21, 22, 23]"

                     The above rule indicates that an adjective, noun or verb stem can combine with a
                     noun stem to form a complex noun stem.           Some examples involving adjectives are

                             It is possible for a verb stem to surface as the initial stem in this word
                     structure rule, but it is difficult to find examples that have not been lexicalized.
                     One clear example is found in Kinkade 1998b:
                     (97)    n-hac=aép=xn

                             There are three right-edge bound stems that are not accounted for by the
                     above word structure rules. The first of these is =ana? ‘all over’, an extension of

                     that conveys an adverbial meaning.          Consider the following examples:
                     (98)     kn      thal’hal’x”’d4na?
                                     t-hal’-hal’x”=ana?

                     In (98), the bound stem =ana? has the nominal interpretation of ‘ear’, while in
                     (99) it has the adverbial meaning ‘all over’.        Examples like (99) suggest that the
                     following word structure rule is operative in Nxa?amxcin:
                     (100) V > V Adv                              Two right-edge bound stems appear to have extended their core nominal
                     meaning to a verbal meaning.           The bound stem =ank has the core meaning
                      ‘stomach’ but is also glossed as ‘want’.       Compare the following examples:
                     (101)    q*tnank
                              q’tun=ank
                              big=stomach
                              big stomach (fat or pregnant)
                     (102)    lut’   kn        = n?itnank

                              Likewise the right-edge bound stem =aya? has the core meaning ‘head’
                     which has been extended the verbal meaning ‘pretend’, as shown in (103) and

                             Examples (103) and (104) suggest that the following word structure rule is
                     present in the language:
                     (105)        VoVV                     The rule in (105) indicates that two verb stems can combine to form a complex
                     verb stem.
                             In the previous section we saw consistency between word structure rules
                     used to form a?-, unmarked and right-edge bound stem compounds.                     The word
                     structure rules in (100) and (105) are inconsistent with the pattern and apply to
                     only one or two bound stems respectively.          I can only speculate at this point but I
                     suspect that examples (99), (102) and (104) are not instances of bound stem
                     compounds, but rather the forms =ana?, =ank and =aya? are functioning as
                     grammatical morphemes in these examples.
                             Hinkson (1999:118) has already indicated that “[t]he suffix *an’/nak is
                     attested with desiderative force and acquires grammatical meaning in the
                     Southern Interior Salish languages Columbian and Okanagan”.                It is possible that
                      =aya? ‘pretend’ could also be subsumed under the category mood.                    With respect
                     to =aya? ‘all over’, we have already seen the prefix ni?- ‘among a bunch of
                     things’ analyzed as a grammatical marker, and it would therefore not be a stretch
                     to consider =aya? ‘all over’ as a grammatical morpheme.
                             It is very difficult to prove the status of these bound stems as lexical or
                     grammatical, and I will leave this question open for future research.","[373, 374, 375, 376]"

                               In section 6.5.1.1 I discussed the derivational operation of nominalization
                      which was marked by the prefix s-. This operation can also take place at the level
                      of syntax and appears to be triggered by certain syntactic contexts.
                               As pointed out in section 7.5, negation can trigger nominalization of the
                      negated predicate.       This is a feature distinguishing the two patterns of negation in
                      Nxa?ramxcin.      In H. Davis’s 2001 analysis, Pattern A negation is comprised of the
                      negation element followed by a nominalized clause.           Some examples are given
                      below:

                               Quasi-clefting (section 5.5.2) often triggers nominalization as well, as

                     5.1   Lexical Categories
                             In this section I briefly address the question of lexical categories in
                     Nxa?amxcin.       Before beginning any discussion of Nxa?amxcin lexical
                     categories, however, it is important to address the ongoing controversy in the
                      Salish literature over the status of nouns and verbs as independent lexical
                     categories.    Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1998:35) remark that “[o]ne of
                     the important controversies in the study of Salish languages concerns the
                     question of whether or not these languages exhibit a distinction between the
                     categories ‘noun’ and ‘verb’ ”. This is an issue that has long been debated in
                     the field of Salish studies. Researchers such as Kuipers (1968), Hukari (1977),
                     Demers and Jelinek (1982, 1984), Kinkade (1983b), Jelinek (1993, 1995, 1998)
                     and Jelinek and Demers (1994) have argued, based on morphological and/or
                     syntactic evidence in various Salish languages, that Salish does not distinguish
                     between nouns and verbs.        In essence, there is no lexical category [+V, -N]
                     indicating verb, and no lexical category [-V, +N] indicating noun.
                             Van Eijk and Hess (1986), Beck (1995, 2002), Demirdache and
                     Matthewson (1996), N. Mattina (1996), Haag (1998), and Davis and Matthewson
                     (1999) have all argued for a noun-verb distinction using morphological and/or
                     syntactic arguments for a wide array of Salish languages.           Kroeber (1999:33-36)
                     also adopts this approach.      The general claim is that at the lexical level there are
                     two distinct categories [+V, -N] and [-V, +N], even though these categories may
                     have fewer properties distinguishing them from each other than in other language
                     families.
                             While the general debate has focused on nouns vs. verbs, the status of
                     adjectives in the grammar is also questionable.3         Consider the following
                     Nxa?amxcin examples:
                             2] do not address subordinate clauses in this chapter.         See sections 7.3.1
                     and 7.7 for relevant data.
                            3The status of adverbs is unclear and will not be addressed here.","[93, 94]"

                      1.3 Outline of the Dissertation
                                This dissertation is very much a data-oriented as opposed to results-
                      oriented piece of work which basically falls into two parts. The first part, chapters
                      2 and 3, provide background information to the second part, the grammatical
                      sketch.    Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional label “polysynthetic” as words
                      tend to be long and morphologically complex.           As a result, understanding how
                      words are put together in this language is relevant to essentially all aspects of its
                      grammar.      Thus, I begin by outlining the theoretical approach to word formation
                      adopted in this work.     A lexeme-based approach to word formation (Matthews
                      1972, 1991; Aronoff 1976, 1994; Anderson 1992; Beard 1995) has proved to
                      have the best explanatory value in the case of Nxa?amxcin.              Chapter 2 provides
                      an introduction to Beard’s (1995) Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology and a
                      brief comparison of this lexeme-based framework with a morpheme-based
                      approach like Lieber (1992).       Note that it is not the purpose here to argue for the
                      superiority of any particular theoretical viewpoint.        I am incorporating a
                      theoretical framework simply as a tool to facilitate a description of the language.
                                In chapter 3, I present an analysis of Nxa?amxcin word structure,
                      specifically focusing on the concepts of root and lexeme.          I argue for a lexemic
                      (as opposed to roof) stem domain in addition to a derivational and inflectional
                      stem at the level of morphological word structure.         I compare my analysis with
                      that of Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998), who proposes a morphological root
                      domain.     I then adopt Czaykowska-Higgins’ analysis that the root is the primary
                      domain at the level of phonological word structure.
                                Having established a theoretical framework and an analysis of the internal
                      structure of words, I then turn to the second part of the dissertation, which is the
                      grammatical sketch. In Chapter 4, I provide a brief introduction to Nxa?amxcin
                     phonology.       Following works by Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade, I discuss
                     the segment inventory of the language, the status of schwa, various segmental
                     processes, syllable structure and stress. In Chapter 5, I present a description of
                     Nxa?amxcin syntax. I first briefly look at the question of whether or not lexical
                     categories should be distinguished in Nxa?amxcin based on an ongoing debate
                     in Salish linguistics. Assuming that verbs, nouns and adjectives are distinct

                     categories in Nxa?amxcin, I then turn to the syntax of noun phrases, simple
                     clauses, relative clauses and fronting constructions.
                             The morphology of Nxa?amxcin is an extensive topic, and is divided here
                     into three separate chapters. Chapter 6 is an overview of lexical operations in the
                     language (i.e. derivational morphology). In this chapter, I address the categories
                     of valence, voice, aspect, control, category-changing operations, locative,
                     dimension (i.e. augmentative, diminutive), and relational. Chapter 7 is an
                     overview of inflectional operations (i.e. inflectional morphology).           Categories
                     discussed are person, number and grammatical relation, viewpoint aspect, mood,
                     temporal marking, negation, non-declarative speech (i.e. interrogative, imperative,
                     prohibitive), and nominalization.
                              The focus of Chapter 8 is compounding, for which I distinguish three
                      separate types in Nxa?amxcin.        The first two types involve free stems only and
                      are referred to as af-compounds and unmarked compounds. I refer to the third
                     type as bound stem compounds.            This type of compounding is generally labelled
                      lexical affixation in the literature.    I enter into the debate over whether these
                      bound stem constructions are syntactically engaged or formed by compounding,
                      and I provide morphological and syntactic arguments in support of a compound
                      analysis.
                              Chapter 9 provides a summary of this work.","[17, 18, 19]"

                     Example (107) indicates that nk’*= can combine with a free noun stem to form a

                                                              Conclusion
                             This dissertation has been a synchronic investigation of the grammar of
                     Nxa?amxcin.       This investigation took place within the context of Beard’s (1995)
                     theory of Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology (LMBM), a lexeme-based
                      approach to word formation.   This theory was outlined in Chapter 2, and
                      although this has not been a theory-centred work, the LMBM approach has been
                      a useful tool in my attempts to understand and explain how Nxa?amxcin words,
                      known for their complexity, are put together.         In Chapter 3 I presented an
                      analysis of levels of word structure in Nxa?amxcin, arguing that it is the lexeme
                      that constitutes the primary level of word structure from a morphological
                      perspective while the root is the primary level from a phonological perspective.
                              The grammatical sketch itself began with Chapter 4, where I presented an
                      introduction to the phonology of Nxa?amxcin. I outlined Nxa?amxcin’s
                      segmental inventory and the various sources of schwa, discussed various
                      segmental processes—tetraction, vowel deletion, consonant deletion,
                      degemination, vocalization and affrication—and presented the major points
                      regarding Nxa?amxcin syllable structure and stress.
                              Chapter 5 provided an overview of Nxa?amxcin syntax.               I first addressed
                      the controversial issue of lexical categories in Salish and adopted the analysis that
                      verbs, nouns and adjectives are distinct lexical categories in Nxa?amxcin but any
                      one of these three can serve a predicative function at the level of syntax.          I then
                      looked at various aspects of the Nxa?amxcin noun phrase:              determiners and
                      demonstratives, oblique and locative prepositions, and genitive marking.             I began
                      my discussion of Nxa?amxcin clause structure with simple clauses and then
                      moved on to the more complex structures of relative clauses, unmarked fronting,
                      quasi-clefting and clefting.     I also presented details on the distribution of the
                      particle wa which is linked to absolutive arguments in active constructions and to
                      the transitive subject in topical object constructions.","[427, 428]"

                     2.1 The Morpheme-Based Model
                             Morpheme-based approaches to morphology have been widely accepted
                     in morphological theories since the early Structuralist views, and it is through this
                     perspective that word-formation is generally taught in introductory linguistics
                      courses, no doubt due to its conceptual simplicity.        In this section I outline the
                     major assumptions of a morpheme-based model and illustrate examples of word
                      formation using Lieber’s (1992) theory.!
                             It is only since Chomsky’s 1970 landmark paper on nominalization that
                     morphology has been recognized as an independent component of generative
                     grammar.     Before that time, morphology was generally subsumed under syntax or
                     phonology. Since 1970, various theories of morphology have surfaced, some of
                     which have been labelled “morpheme-based” approaches to morphology. These
                     include works by Lieber 1981, 1992; Selkirk 1982; Scalise 1984; Sproat 1985;
                     DiSciullo and Williams 1987; and Baker 1988, 1996. While these morpheme-
                     based theories differ from each other in a number of ways, there are several
                     underlying assumptions common to all that can be traced back to Bloomfield
                     (1933). The first of these assumptions concerns minimal forms in grammar.             From a
                     morpheme-based perspective, there is only one type of minimal element in word
                     formation and that is the morpheme.         Using the English noun bakers as an
                     example for illustration, there are three minimal elements, {bake, -er, -s}, all of
                     which are necessarily of the same type element: the morpheme.              Although bake is
                     clearly an independent form in the language and -er and -s bound affixes, with
                     respect to word formation each of these forms are considered to belong to one
                     group. They are all minimal forms, hence they are all morphemes.
                             The next major assumption of a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation is that all morphemes constitute signs, meaning that all features of a                             1See also Beard 1995 for a comparison of Lieber 1992 with LMBM.",[21]

                     the largest part of this grammatical sketch. In this chapter I first looked at the
                     category valence examining various types of intransitives as well as four different
                     valence-changing operations: transitive, causative, applicative and external
                     possession.    The following section on voice was divided into two parts:
                     pragmatic voice and semantic voice. The former comprises topical object, passive,
                     antipassive and indefinite object operations, and the latter middle, reflexive and
                     reciprocal operations.     Secondary aspect was addressed in the following section
                      focusing on stative, inchoative, habitual, repetitive and iterative aspect.        Two
                      operations which indicate an agent’s lack of control over a situation were then
                      addressed.    These operations, referred to in the literature as out-of-control and
                      limited control, are subsumed under the label control. Five different category-
                      changing operations were looked at in the following section, four of which
                      involve nominalization—general, instrumental, agentive, and potentially locative
                      prefixing—and one creating adjectival stems.          The category locative was the
                      focus of the next section for which there are seven positional and three
                      directional operations.    The category dimension comprises two reduplicative
                      operations:   augmentative and diminutive.        And finally, the operation relational
                      was viewed independently as it did not seem to belong with any of the other
                      larger categories.
                              Chapter 7 presented an overview of inflectional operations in
                      Nxa?amxcin. The marking of person, number and grammatical relational was first
                      reviewed, followed by a discussion of viewpoint aspect, specifically perfective
                      and imperfective operations. I then took a brief look at mood, an area requiring
                      more attention in Salish languages.       I examined the irrealis operation and briefly
                      touched on potential, deontic and probability mood.          The temporal marking of
                      past and future was addressed, followed by the two patterns of negation that are
                      found in the language.      The following section contained non-declarative
                      operations:   yes/no questions, the imperative, and the prohibitive. Finally, |
                      looked at nominalized constructions.
                              In Chapter 8 I investigated the three types of compounds that are present
                      in Nxa?amxcin:       at-compounds, unmarked compounds and bound stem

                     grammar, arguing that these constructions should be viewed as a type of
                     compounding as opposed to syntactic noun incorporation.
                             The goal of this dissertation has been the creation of the first grammatical
                     sketch of the Nxa?amxcin language.          It is hoped that this sketch will fill a void
                     until a more comprehensive grammar of Nxa?amxcin is available.","[428, 429, 430]"

                              The question of the grammatical status of the agent and patient in topical
                     object constructions is an interesting one.       On the surface it appears that the
                     agent maintains subject status while the patient maintains object status, as is the
                     case with active clauses.     One must note, however, the positioning of the particle

                      constructions.    In direct active clauses, this particle marks the object of transitives
                      and the subject (with some possible restrictions) of intransitives.            For this reason it
                      has been referred to by Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) and Willett (1996) as
                      an absolutive marker.      If we compare bivalent active clauses with the bivalent
                      topical object construction we find that the distribution of the particle wa is the
                      exact reverse.    Compare the active voice example in (a) with the topical object

                     8.4.4.1.2    Baker’s Syntactic Analysis of Noun Incorporation
                             Baker (1996, chapter 7) takes a much narrower view of noun
                     incorporation than Mithun, using the term noun incorporation specifically in
                     reference to a syntactic process whereby a N+V stem is formed via movement.             He
                     provides a number of syntactic and semantic tests as a guideline for
                     distinguishing between N+V combinations that are formed in the syntax and
                     those that are formed in the lexicon.
                             Baker claims that true noun incorporation is found in polysynthetic
                     languages—languages that are subject to the Morphological Visibility Condition

                      5.6 The Particle wa
                              The particle wa has previously been referred to as an absolutive marker by
                      Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) and Willett (1996). Willett has specifically
                      argued that wa optionally surfaces when a maximal projection has an absolutive
                      case feature.     In this section I provide a descriptive account of the particle wa.
                              In simple clauses, NP’s surface in post-predicate position and if the particle
                      wa does surface, it appears to the left of the absolutive NP (i.e. transitive
                      object/intransitive subject), as illustrated in the following examples:

                      surfacing to the left of the subject NP.     (157) and (158) contain transitive
                     predicates and the wa particle surfaces to the left of the object NP.
                              Topical object constructions are interesting in that the reverse is true.
                     Topical object voice, discussed in section 6.2.1.1, is marked on bivalent stems by
                     the suffix -wa (reduced to -u when unstressed).          What is so interesting about
                     these constructions is that when the particle wa appears, it surfaces to the left of
                     the subject, as opposed to the object.       Consider the following examples:
                      (159)   ?aw’tapntus                ttw’it              wa __ Sx’ arcinm

                              The deer followed the boy.

                              Chuck talks to people.                                                      91.106
                     If we compare examples (157) and (158) with (159) and (160), the difference is
                     obvious; the particle wa is linked to the transitive object in active voice and the
                     transitive subject in topical object voice.
                              With respect to fronting constructions, we find the particle wa does not
                     surface to the left of fronted absolutives, but rather to the left of the residue.
                     Consider first unmarked fronting constructions:

                      7.3.1   Irrealis
                              Irrealis is a highly productive category in Nxa?amxcin and any thorough
                      analysis of its distribution spills over into the syntax of the language. In his
                      discussion of realis/irrealis mode, Payne (1997:244) gives the following definition:
                             A prototypical realis mode strongly asserts that a specific event or state of
                             affairs has actually happened, or actually holds true. A prototypical irrealis
                             mode makes no such assertion whatsoever. Irrealis mode does not
                             necessarily assert that an event did not take place or will not take place. It
                             simply makes no claims with respect to the actuality of the event or
                             situation described.
                     Irrealis examples are often glossed in the Salish literature as ‘unrealized’ (e.g.
                     Kinkade and Mattina 1981, Kinkade 1996a) or as ‘future’ (e.g. N. Mattina
                      1999a).

                     This example is unusual in that it appears to be marked imperfective by both the

                     3.4.2   Determining if a Category is Derivational or Inflectional
                             The literature outlines numerous criteria for distinguishing between
                      derivation and inflection, but in reality it has proven impossible to determine a
                      steadfast set of rules with cross-linguistic application that predict which
                      categories should be considered derivational and which inflectional.               Bybee
                      (1985) considers the derivational vs. inflectional distinction to be a gradient one
                     whereby categories most intrinsically tied to the root (i.e. derivational) are at one
                      end of a spectrum while the categories least tied to the root (i.e. inflectional) are at
                      the other.   Bybee (p.99) makes certain generalizations regarding the cross-
                      linguistic status of some categories, however acknowledging that a derivational
                      category in one language may be inflectional in another.           This is also noted by
                      Anderson (1992:82), who uses diminutive formation in Fula (Niger-Congo) and
                      English as a comparative example; the diminutive category is considered to be
                      inflectional in Fula, while in English diminutive forms are viewed as derivational.
                              Cases like this where one category can appear at different ends of a
                      spectrum depending on the language, involve more than just a distinction as to
                     where the operation actually takes place (i.e. the lexicon vs. syntax).             Bybee
                      states (1985:99) that “in cases where similar conceptual content is expressed in
                     the two different ways, we will find that the inflectional expression requires a
                     fully general meaning, while the derivational does not”. Hence, while English
                     and Fula each have a diminutive category, the claim that it is derivational in one

                     tied to the root than the latter.2!
                              Of the numerous criteria found in the literature, I have focused on five
                      while determining which categories belong at the derivational stem level and
                      which at the inflectional stem level in Nxa?amxcin: (i) the Peripheral Affix Test;
                      (ii) semantic relevance; (iii) the ability to change features in lexical
                      representations; (iv) portmanteau morphemes; (v) the Free Analog Test.
                              (i) The Peripheral Affix Test. The first of these criteria is the widely noted
                      observation (appearing as Universal 28 in Greenberg 1963 and as The
                      Peripheral Affix Test in Beard 1995) regarding the cross-linguistic consistency of
                      ordering of derivational and inflectional morphemes with respect to each other.
                      Anderson (1992:77) writes that:
                              [...] in forms where both derivational and inflectional morphology are
                              overtly represented, material corresponding to productive inflection comes
                              “outside of’ other morphology. That is, where two or more suffixes are
                              involved, inflectional ones come after derivational ones; and where
                              prefixes are involved, inflectional ones come before derivational ones.
                              Even where a prefix and a suffix are involved, an argument can sometimes
                              be constructed for the relative order in which they must have been added
                              to the stem, and in such cases as well the derivational material seems to be
                              added prior to the addition of productive inflection.
                      Thus, we can expect to find derivational morphemes closer to the root than
                      inflectional morphemes.
                              There are a number of operations in Nxa?amxcin that are quite clearly tied
                      to the root and can thus be considered derivational based on the Peripheral Affix
                      Test. These categories are marked by either morphemes or reduplicated forms and
                      always appear at the innermost core of the Nxa?amxcin word.               The inchoative

                             21Interestingly enough, I have often had difficulty directly eliciting
                     causative and inchoative constructions in Nxa?amxcin. While causative and
                     inchoative are clearly syntactic categories in English, they are derivational in
                     Nxa?amxcin. Under Bybee’s analysis the derivational causative and inchoative
                     categories should have meanings that are of greater relevance to the predicate
                     than the causative and inchoative categories realized as independent syntactic
                     items. This might account for the difficulty in eliciting these constructions.","[66, 67]"

                     NPs is reversed.     In (54) the direct object ttw’it ‘boy’ appears immediately
                      following the predicate and the subject kiy’dna? ‘girl’ is in final position. This
                     represents the unmarked word order VOS.             In (55) the same subject appears
                      adjacent to the predicate and the direct object is in final position.        This VSO
                      ordering is not as frequent as VOS, but is possible nonetheless.
                              One might think that such variations on word order would lead to
                      ambiguity, but this is not the case. The particle wa, which surfaces in both (54)
                      and (55), serves as a disambiguating device.             Czaykowska-Higgins (1996,
                      1998:160) and Willett (1996) analyze this particle as a third person absolutive
                      marker which surfaces with 3rd person transitive objects and 3rd person
                      intransitive subjects.   In both (54) and (55) it precedes ttw’it ‘boy’ making it clear
                      that ttw’it is the object in these constructions.         I address the particle wa in detail
                      in section 5.6.
                              Unmarked intransitive word order is VS, as shown in (56) to (57):

                     may indicate that they should be included with the other synchronic bound stems
                     in (68), but for now they will be considered of diachronic relevance only.
                             There are several bound stems that generally only surface when combined
                     with other bound stems. The bound stem =aya?, in addition to the meaning
                      ‘pretend’ in (68), also has the meaning ‘head’ but combines with another bound
                      stem, =qin ‘head’, for this particular meaning.        The bound stem =olqst ‘shin’
                      always cooccurs with the bound stem =xn ‘foot’. And, from the few examples I
                     have seen, the bound stem =atk""up ‘fire’ (as opposed to =atk”p ‘fire’) cooccurs
                      with =us ‘fire. Such complex forms are discussed in section 8.3.3.
                              Many of the bound stems in (68) are given multiple glosses.           As Kinkade
                      (1998b:266) indicates, “the first lexeme in the gloss [...] is the basic meaning; all
                      the others extend some part of the basic concept.         The extensions are not always
                      obvious, although they often have explanations from within the culture”.
                      Hinkson (1999) claims that these extensions “can be seen as forming a radial
                      category around a core, or central meaning” (p.32) and that they “are based on
                      perceived or imputed similarity to the central core of a category.         The links
                      connecting meaning extensions to each other and to the center of the category
                      are the standard paths of lexical change, i.e. metaphor, metonymy, spatial
                      contiguity, and analogy” (p.41).       The relationships between the various meanings
                      associated with a bound stem are not the focus of this work, thus I refer the
                     reader to Saunders and Davis (1975a: Bella Coola), Czaykowski (1982:
                     Nxa?amxcin), and especially Hinkson (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001: pan-Salish) as
                     these relationships are the central focus of her work.
                             I make the preliminary assumption here that right-edge bound stem
                     constructions are a type of compounding, and provide evidence for this later in
                     section 8.4.3.    I assume that bound stem constructions are created by the same
                     word structure rules responsible for the a7- and unmarked compounds in section
                      8.2. I discuss these rules below.","[368, 369]"

                     7.3.4    Probability
                              Probability is generally subsumed under the label epistemic modality
                     which Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:179) describe as follows:
                           Epistemic modality applies to assertions and indicates the extent to which
                           the speaker is committed to the truth of the proposition. The unmarked
                           case in this domain is total commitment to the truth of the proposition, and
                           markers of epistemic modality indicate something less than a total
                           commitment by the speaker to the truth of the proposition.",[331]

                             In the previous two sections I discussed and compared both morpheme-
                     based and lexeme-based approaches to morphology.               The reason for the
                     comparison was, in part, to provide the background for this section where I
                     discuss one major advantage of LMBM over morpheme-based theories.
                             There are a number of cross-linguistic morphological patterns that are
                     problematic for a morpheme-based approach to morphology.                 What is often found
                     when examining the morphology of a particular language is that form and
                     function do not always show a one to one correspondence.               For example, in both
                     English and Nxa?amxcin we can find forms where more than one morpheme is
                     linked to a single function. The plural form of child in English is one example.
                     Two separate processes take place when this form is marked plural. First, there is
                     a vowel change from [a1] to [1]; second, there is the addition of the suffix -ren,
                     resulting in [Ciljron]. The following Nxa?amxcin example also illustrates this
                     kind of morphological asymmetry:
                     (10)    tex*mintn
                             tox-min-tn

                     Both -min and -tn are glossed as instrumental suffixes.          In (10) we have one
                     function, instrumental, linked with two forms, -min and -tn.
                             Conversely, it is possible for one morpheme to be linked to a number of
                     different functions.    In the Nxa?amxcin example in (11), person, number and
                     grammatical function can be represented by a single form.                     (11)    ?omcinn

                     the suffix -nn represents (i) Ist person, (ii) singular and (iii) subject function,
                     illustrating that multiple functions can be associated with one form.
                               Another problem for morpheme-based theories is zero morphology:
                     meaning is present but there is no corresponding form. For example, some
                     English resultative nominalizations require affixation while others do not:                      (12)     Resultative Nominalization
                                       Affixed                               Unaffixed

                               acarv-ing      a confess-ion                  a find                Beard 1995:26
                      In (12), ‘slice’, ‘roll’ and ‘find’ are nominalized without any overt marking to
                     represent this function.     The most common occurrence of zero morphology in
                     Nxafamxcin is the 3rd person absolutive.           3rd person intransitive subjects and
                     transitive objects are never overtly marked, as shown in the following examples:

                     Example (13) contains an intransitive predicate with a third person subject.             While
                     the grammatical features for third person intransitive subject are interpreted in this
                     construction, there is no overt phonological marking to indicate that the subject is
                     third person. Example (14) contains a transitive predicate with a third person
                     object.    Again, the grammatical features are present but there is no phonology
                     present to indicate third person transitive object.
                               Conversely, it is possible for a form to be present without any associated
                     meaning.     Such forms are referred to as empty morphology.          In the following

                      corresponding morpheme; (iv) a morpheme but no corresponding meaning.              The
                      problem with morpheme-based approaches in these cases is tied in with the
                      general assumption that morphemes are assumed to be linguistic signs. If
                      morphemes are comprised of indivisible units of phonological, grammatical and
                      semantic features, how does one account for the fact that certain features do not
                      show a one-to-one correspondence or that some features are absent altogether?
                      As Beard (1995) points out, it is very difficult to do this without resorting to
                      additional stipulations.
                              Morphological asymmetry is not a problem for Beard’s LMBM theory.                In
                      fact, as Beard notes, such lack of one to one correspondence is predictable in his
                      theory given that phonological, grammatical and semantic features are treated
                      separately. Take the example where more than one morpheme is linked to a
                      single meaning, as in (10). In LMBM this is simply a case of the morphological
                      spelling component using two suffixes to mark one lexical/inflectional operation.
                      Conversely, examples like (11), where one morpheme is linked to multiple
                     meanings, involve one spelling operation used to mark more than one
                     derivational/inflectional operation.
                           Zero morphology and empty morphology can also be accounted for within
                     the LMBM framework. Zero morphemes, like those found in (12), (13) and (14),
                     are instances of lexical/inflectional operations that do not trigger morphological
                     spelling operations. Empty morphemes, on the other hand, are morphological
                     spelling operations that do not mark any lexical/inflectional operations.
                             Morpological mismatches like those discussed above are found
                     throughout Nxa?amxcin.         If one analyzes Nxa?amxcin word formation from a
                     morpheme-based perspective, these mismatches must be accounted for. Because
                     these mismatches fall naturally within LMBM theory, I have chosen to analyze
                     Nxa?amxcin word formation within this framework.","[36, 37]"

                      7.6.2 Imperative
                              The imperative, as defined by Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994:179), is
                      “the form used to issue a direct command to a second person”.              Nxa?amxcin
                      imperatives have been addressed in detail by N. Mattina (1999b), and the facts
                      are outlined here.
                              Nxa?famxcin imperative constructions are marked by a second position
                      clitic. This clitic takes the form ta? in the singular and wonta? in the plural. These
                      imperative marking clitics (unlike the intransitive subject clitics discussed in
                     section 7.1.1 and the past clitic in 7.4) maintain a fixed position in the clause:
                     both are strictly second position. The following examples contain clause-initial
                     particles illustrating that the imperative clitic surfaces immediately following the
                     particle:17

                               Compare example (545) with (544).         They both contain the predicate ‘to
                      wait for’, but the speaker in (544) uses the prefix k’#- while the speaker in (545)
                      uses the prefix kt-. Examples (546) to (548) also illustrate the positional meaning
                      associated with k’?-, but the speaker has chosen to use k#- instead.
                             Like the positional prefix k-, the prefix k’?- can surface on predicates
                      involving some kind of communicative event, the following example:
                      (549)    k?tk*dncntx’

                     6.6.1.5 n-/na-
                              This positional prefix, which Kinkade (1999) glosses as ‘into, onto’, is the
                     first in this list of locatives to involve two variants: na- and n-. It is not clear
                     which of these is underlying, but their distribution is predictable.
                               Examples (550) to (552) below illustrate both forms of the n(a)- positional
                     prefix:

                      be marked for both the causative and desiderative operations while neither apply
                      to unaccusatives.2      Such a diagnostic would be of great value to an analysis of
                      Nxa?amxcin verbs; however I have no such diagnostic at this time. Thus, for the
                      purposes of this discussion, I rely on the semantic properties of verbs.
                              Perlmutter (1978:162-163) provided the first semantic characterization of
                      unergatives and unaccusatives, stating that unergatives are “[p]redicates
                      describing willed or volitional acts” in addition to “[c]ertain involuntary bodily
                      processes”. Unaccusatives are defined, in part, as “[p]redicates whose initial
                      nuclear term is semantically a Patient”. Using these semantic characterizations as
                      a guide, a pattern emerges among Nxa?amxcin intransitives in which some
                      predicates patterning semantically with Perlmutter’s unergatives are marked by
                      the suffix -m, whereas those patterning with Perlmutter’s unaccusatives have no
                      m-marking.
                              Turning first to unergative verbs, we find that intransitive predicates falling
                      under the semantics of this category are usually marked by the suffix -m, as
                      shown in (9) to (17):

                      unaccusatives pattern with unergatives in that they can be either causativized or
                      marked for desiderative.

                     3.3.1 The Lexemic Stem
                              The need for recognizing a lexemic stem has been put forward by a
                     number of Salishanists working in the area of word formation.? Hess (1993:113),
                      in his analysis of Lushootseed verb stems, writes:
                             The root is easily discernible in the vast majority of Lushootseed verbs;
                             however, it is the stem and not the root that is the basic descriptive unit of
                             that verb. The descriptive primacy of the stem has gone unnoticed for
                             many years due to the salience of the root (almost always CVC) which
                             attracted (or distracted) the researchers’ attention and because several
                             stem classes turned out to have identical shapes in most utterances
                             effectively camouflaging significant differences among them.
                     N. Mattina (1996) follows Hess’s approach in her study of word formation in
                      Okanagan, stating (p.15-—6):
                             Because of the importance of the canonical (C)CVC(C) shape in defining
                             Salish roots, we cannot equate the Salishan root with the general term
                             lexeme, as we can in many other languages. The most obvious reason for
                             this is that there are many lexemes that do not have the canonical shape of
                             aroot. These are forms that are wholly or partially unanalyzable by
                             speakers, but which speakers nevertheless recognize as words.
                             While the phonological representation for many Nxa?amxcin lexemes is
                     the root itself, for some lexemes this is not the case. There are numerous examples
                     in Nxafamxcin whereby a root and some additional morphology are reanalyzed.
                     These additional reanalyzed segments were at one time prefixes, suffixes, infixes,
                     or segments resulting from phonological operations such as reduplication, which
                     cooccurred with a particular root. As Black (1996:236) notes in her discussion of
                            9Michelson’s 1990 analysis of Oneida also acknowledges the need to
                     recognize such stems in an analysis of word formation.",[48]

                     8.4.3.1 Word Structure Rules
                             Carlson (1990), Kinkade (1998b) and Czaykowska-Higgins (to appear)
                     have all observed that the stem combinations found in lexical suffix constructions
                     parallel those found in compounds.!9         If we put aside the examples of =ana? ‘all
                     over’, =ank ‘want’, and =aya? ‘pretend’ (discussed in section 8.3.1.3), which
                     are semantic extensions of their core meanings and may in fact be grammatical
                     markers, the word structure rules used to form lexical suffix constructions in
                     Nxa?amxcin match exactly those used to form free stem compounds.                    This is
                     illustrated by the following examples:

                     will assume, however, following Kinkade 1996b, that lexical prefixes are a
                     relatively new innovation in Salish and exclude them from this discussion.",[405]

"
                      The particle sa? usually appears in initial position in front of any mood particles,
                      but can also surface at the end of a clause as shown in (174) and (175).           When it
                      surfaces in clause-final position, the [s] is dropped, resulting simply in [a].",[338]

                                                                                                                15                     never the other way around.        Morphemes essentially modify the phonological
                     representations of lexemes and therefore it is both logical and necessary that
                     lexemes always precede any morphology.            Third, while lexemes are open classes,
                     affixes are always closed classes and never undergo the same lexical and
                     inflectional operations as lexemes. And finally, lexemes are always listable items.
                     They are never operations or rules like affixes.
                             Beard argues that morphemes, which are closed-class items such as bound
                     affixes and clitics, are not indivisible units comprised of mutually implied
                     phonological, grammatical and semantic features, as is assumed in morpheme-
                     based theories of morphology.        Rather, they are “modifications of the
                     phonological form [...] of lexemes” (Beard:44).         These modifications
                     phonologically mark the addition of some grammatical and/or semantic feature to
                     a stem by modifying the phonological form of a stem. Thus, the diagram given for
                      -er in example (1b) is incompatible with the LMBM framework.              The term
                     morpheme refers only to the phonological features [ar], as shown in (5):
                     (5)             -or
                                      {[or]}                          Phonological features        (morpheme)
                                      {n[v[ ]_]}                       grammatical features
                                      {someone who does V}             semantic features
                     As the individual curly brackets in (5) indicate, the suffix -or is not comprised of
                     indivisible features, as was the case for the lexeme bake in (4). As we will see in
                     the following section, each of these features are associated with a separate
                     component in the grammar and are distinct from each other. With respect to the
                     term morpheme, it is indicated in (5) that the morphemic element is associated
                     with the phonological features only. It does not refer to the grammatical or
                     semantic features in (5), but rather signals that these features have been added to
                     a particular stem.
                             Beard splits morphemes into two types:          bound grammatical morphemes
                     and free grammatical morphemes.           The former he defines as the “modifications
                     of the phonological form [...] of lexemes” (p.44). This encompasses prefixation,

                     [They] must also be stored in an autonomous morphological component but

                     such as clitics, prepositions and articles.","[27, 28, 29]"

                             ?axa?   ‘close to the speaker’
                             faci    ‘away from the speaker’
                             Pati?   ‘further away from the speaker’
                     N. Mattina (2002:263) states that the last three determiners in (5) “are formed on
                     roots Vxa?, Vci, and Viu?, respectively, which are found in dozens of lexical items
                      [...]. Non-demonstrative ?ani is formed on a root that is less productive, but
                     which has cognates in other Interior Salishan languages.           The increment ?a-
                     found in each article is a formal determinant of the Moses-Columbia article set.”
                      Some examples of the general article are given in (6) to (9):

                     Note that while the general article ?ani is usually translated as ‘the’, speakers
                     sometimes use either ‘that’ or ‘this’ in translations, as in (7).
                             Examples of the other three articles, which seem to convey a deictic sense,
                     are given in (10) to (15):

                     have been marked for possession.            In addition, more than one article can precede
                     the same noun, as illustrated in (16):

                             Turning now to the demonstrative pronoun system, N. Mattina (2002:264)
                     lists the following for Nxa?amxcin:
                     (19)    Demonstrative Pronouns
                             Pixa?     ‘this one (here)’

                             Pita      ‘that one’
                     N. Mattina points out that these demonstratives contain the same roots as the last
                     three articles listed in (5).   She indicates (p.263) that “[t]he demonstrative
                     particles have the increment 7i- (and concomitant regulatization of the root vowel
                     to a) where the articles have ?a-; the same roots are used for both.”
                             There is little information available on demonstrative pronouns in
                     Nxa?amxcin, and I am unable to discuss in any detail the particulars of their
                     distribution.   N. Mattina does point out that demonstratives can have a
                     predicative function in Nxafamxcin, as shown in the following examples:

                     As we will see in section 5.6, the position of the particle wa in (21) suggests that
                      ‘grandfather’s house’ is an absolutive argument, i.e. subject of an intransitive
                     predicate.

                     In (45) the inchoative marker -?- appears inside the root Vq""uc, resulting in g™u?c.
                     The predicate taqlx in (46) is marked out-of-control by the reduplication of the
                      second consonant, resulting in taqglx.         Both of these categories are represented
                     by forms that not only appear close to the root but actually surface inside the
                     root. If inflectional morphemes appear outside derivational ones, then both
                     inchoative and out-of-control categories must be derivational since their markers
                      surface within the root domain.

                      segments(s) of the root (CjaC- or C;- respectively), and these reduplicative
                     prefixes appear at the immediate left edge of the root, as in (47) and (48).
                      Likewise, the stative and inchoative suffixes -t and -p always surface at the
                      immediate right edge of the root, as in (49) and (50). Given that all of the
                      morphemes highlighted in (47) to (50) appear adjacent to the root without any
                      possibility of intervening material, I assume they are markers of derivational
                      operations.
                              (ii) Semantic Relevance.        The position of derivational and inflectional
                      morphology with respect to the root directly ties in with the second observation
                      which centres on the semantic contribution of derivational and inflectional rules
                      to the word.    Scalise (1988:563) claims that derivational rules “change the
                      conceptual meaning of their base”, while inflectional rules “change the
                      grammatical meaning of their base”. This is addressed in detail in Bybee 1985,
                      who states (p.99) that:
                              [...] inflectional meaning is always very general, indeed, often so general as
                              to be redundant in context, and it is always transparent in the sense that its
                              combination with a stem always produces a predictable meaning.
                              Derivational meaning, on the other hand, has more semantic content and
                              often produces idiosyncratic meanings in combination with different
                              lexical stems.
                      According to Bybee, the greater the semantic relevance to the root, the closer the
                      morpheme will appear to the root.
                              The locative, relational, and limited control categories all provide the root
                      with some form of semantic extension, as illustrated in (51) to (53):

                      The examples in (51) illustrate the semantic contribution of a locative prefix to the
                      predicate.    The root Viot’ in isolation means ‘wet’, as in (51a). When the locative
                      prefix kat- is affixed in (51b), the predicate takes on the additional meaning that
                      the location of the wet state is on a flat surface.     The relational category also
                      contributes additional semantic properties to the predicate as it indicates some
                      action either moving away from the agent towards another entity, or moving
                      towards the agent.     This is illustrated in (52b) where the combination of the root
                      Vyovw ‘strong’, the bound stem =akst ‘hand’, and the relational suffix -min
                      indicate that something is being forced by hand either away from or towards the
                      agent.    The limited control category provides the additional meaning that
                      something was done accidentally or with difficulty.          As we see in (53b), when the
                      limited control suffix is added to the reanalyzed stem yarmin ‘push’, the
                      interpretation of the predicate becomes ‘push accidentally’.
                               All three of the above categories provide additional features to the
                      predicate beyond that of grammatical features.          These three categories extend the
                      meaning of the predicate in such ways that there are fundamental changes to the
                      meaning of the predicate if these are removed.         As a result, these categories
                      should be considered derivational.        Sentential aspect, however, has the opposite
                      effect on a predicate in that any change in sentential aspect has no effect
                      whatsoever on the semantic interpretation of the predicate of a clause.            Consider
                      the following two examples:

                      The example in (54a) appears in the unmarked perfective form, giving one a
                      closed view of the activity that took place (i.e. it is seen from start to finish). The
                      example in (54b) provides an alternate view as it is marked for imperfective
                      aspect.        In this case an open-ended view of the activity is presented with no
                      specific start or end-point.         If we change the view from closed to open, the
                      semantic integrity of the predicate is not compromised.           Whether the predicate is
                      perfective or imperfective, the meaning of the verb, in this case ‘to eat’, remains
                      constant.        This indicates that sentential aspect should be considered inflectional.
                                (iii) Ability to Change Features in Lexical Representations.             Regarding
                      the third criterion, there is a fundamental distinction between derivation and
                      inflection with respect to what each of these can do.           Scalise (1988) remarks that
                      rules of derivation seem to be more powerful than those of inflection, observing
                      (p.562) that “given a lexical representation, [derivational rules] can change
                      virtually every single bit of information attached to it, while [inflectional rules]
                      can change only a fixed set of linguistic information (gender, number, etc.)”.
                      Operations that clearly have an effect on the lexical representation of a lexeme
                      are valence-changing categories.            These categories can manipulate how many
                      participants are involved in a situation by changing the subcategorization
                      features of a lexeme.           One example of this is the category transitive which creates
                      predicates that subcategorize for two participants from predicates which would
                      normally subcategorize for one participant, as shown in (55):
                      (55)      a.        kas-k’4x-t-ox”

                      The predicate k”ax” ‘wake up’ in (55a) has not undergone any valence-
                      changing operation and, therefore, subcategorizes for a single argument.              In (55b)
                      the same predicate is marked for the operation transitive resulting in two direct
                      arguments.    Because valence-changing categories can make changes to the
                      lexical representation of a lexeme, I include them in the derivational stem level.
                              The voice categories are another example of operations that can alter the
                      lexical representations of lexemes.      This category can alter which argument in a
                      lexical representation will assume the role of subject of the predicate.           Example
                      (56a) illustrates the unmarked active voice.       In this example the agent is the
                      subject of the predicate c’alx ‘scratch’ while the theme serves as the direct
                      object. If we compare this with example (56b) marked for passive voice, the
                      theme, in this case Paci xaxal’a? ‘baby’, is now the subject of the clause while
                      the agent, pus ‘cat’, appears as an oblique object.

                             significance but used only in combination with other stems or elements of
                             words and usually unrelated in form to the independent words of the same
                             significance, furnish apparent instances of incorporation, in that they are
                             sometimes used as objects of verb stems with which they are combined.
                             They are however also employed subjectively and adverbially, and are
                             therefore more than incorporated nouns. The essential nature and function
                             of these elements is still obscure, and until they become better understood
                             they also can furnish no proof of objective noun-incorporation.
                                                                                   A. Kroeber 1909:572-3                              ... it is clear that verbal affixes that refer to nouns, in other words, convey a
                              substantival idea, are not instances of noun incorporation if they are
                             etymologically unrelated to the independent nouns or noun stems with
                             which they seem logically connected. Such affixes are generally either
                             instrumental (Siouan, Shoshonean) or local (Kwakiutl, Salish) in character,
                             but may also be employed to represent the logical object or even, in the
                             case of intransitive verbs, subject (this use is characteristic of Kwakiutl,
                             Chemakum, and Salish). As long, however, as they are lexically distinct
                             from noun stems proper, they must be looked upon as grammatical
                             elements pure and simple, however concrete their signification may seem.
                             They are logically related to independent nouns of the same or allied
                             meaning as are tense affixes to independent adverbs of time.
                                                                                             Sapir 1911:251-2
                              The main reason lexical affixes have not fit neatly into any specific cross-
                      linguistic category is due to their dual or ‘split’? behaviour.     As Egesdal (1981)
                     points out, lexical information is generally associated with stems and grammatical
                      information with affixes. In Salish, he claims, we have an affix that carries lexical
                      information.    Egesdal also notes the lack of etymological relationship between the
                      lexical affixes and their independent forms; bound stems generally bear no
                     resemblance whatsoever to their overt NP counterpart(s).            The following forms
                     illustrate that this is clearly the case for Nxa?amxcin:

                     resemblance to their corresponding independent forms in the righthand column.
                      In fact, the bound stems in (150) cannot even be interpreted as reduced forms of
                     the independent nouns.       This is an observation that has been noted consistently
                     throughout the Salish literature.      Egesdal surmises that the fact that these affixes
                      are seemingly archaic morphemes within the family has deterred many Salishanists
                      from making any speculative claims as to their origin.
                              Following A. Kroeber’s and Sapir’s reference to Salish “substantival”
                      suffixes, there was relatively little work published on these affixes—outside of
                     Reichard 1938 and Vogt 1940—auntil the sixties and seventies when research on
                      a variety of different Salish languages surfaced.       Most of this work was largely
                      descriptive, resulting in a larger amount of data made available for future research.
                     This includes works such as Pidgeon’s (1970) description of lexical suffixes in
                      Saanich, Haeberlin’s (1974) previous description of pan-Salish lexical suffixes
                      edited by M.T. Thompson, and Saunders and Davis’ (1975a) discussion of Bella
                     Coola.    Newman (1968) and Kinkade (1973) both presented papers at the
                     International Conference on Salish Languages|4, Newman’s work a
                     comparative look at lexical suffixes across the Salish family and Kinkade’s
                     devoted to lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin.         Discussion of lexical suffixes also
                     appeared in various grammars during this time period, such as Harris 1963;
                     Kuipers 1967, 1974; and Leslie 1979; among others. In 1987, A. Mattina
                     presented a paper at the 26th Conference on American Indian Languages which
                     was a comparative study of lexical suffixes and lexical prefixes across the Salish
                     family.
                            Works by Gerdts and Hinkson (1996) and Mithun (1997) have focused on
                     the diachronic development of lexical affixes. Gerdts and Hinkson (p.164)
                     propose that “lexical suffixes are the final stage of a process whereby a free noun
                     becomes increasingly fused to an element with which it is compounded until it

                     However, when I tried to elicit an example with wack and the lexical suffix =atp
                     ‘tree’, the sentence was rejected.

                               (The tree fell over.)
                              This unacceptablity does not appear to be the result of some
                     incompatibility between the verb ‘fall over’ and the concept of a tree, as the
                     independent form for ‘tree’ can surface with wack, as in (220):
                     (220) ?acp’ax’       =?ani       wadck
                           tree           DET        _fall over-(3AB)

                      The above examples all contain transitive predicates marked for imperfective
                      aspect by the prefix ?ac-/c-. In (83) to (86), the variant ?ac- surfaces because,
                      prosodically, the prefix is adjacent to a stressed mora, i.e. the stressed vowel of the
                      root. In (87) to (90) the c- variant appears as the prefix is adjacent to an
                     unstressed mora.     As (83) to (90) indicate, imperfectives are marked transitive by
                      the transitive suffix -stu (section 6.1.2).10                             10While most transitives are marked imperfective by the prefix ?ac-/c-,

                     marked examples in (83) to (90), the predicates in (i) to (iii) are also marked
                     transitive by the suffix -stu indicating that -stu as a transitive marker is not

                                According to Bybee (1985:28), mood “refers to the way the speaker
                      presents the truth of the proposition in the discourse and real-world context”.
                      The operations that actually fall under this definition can vary from one author to
                      another.     This section presents a somewhat sketchy look at mood in Nxa?amxcin,
                      as the picture is not entirely clear. I limit this discussion to the operations of
                      irrealis, potential, deontic and probability.     I have grouped these together here for
                      the sake of unification, but note that only the irrealis represents an inflectional
                      operation.    The others — potential, deontic, and probability — are marked by
                      particles, small (mono or bisyllabic) words which Kinkade (1981b:32) notes “may
                      not be inflected and, in Salishan languages, may not be predicative”.","[321, 322, 323]"

                     some type of quirky case-marking as ergatives of applicative (26) and transitive
                     ((27) to (29)) clauses in Nxa?amxcin do not have oblique status. This type of
                     ergative marking is a pattern common to the Southern Interior Salish languages,
                     as addressed in Kroeber 1988, 1999:52-3.
                             There is evidence that the oblique marker tis in the process of
                     disappearing in the language as sometimes the oblique marker is omitted
                     altogether by speakers.        This phenomenon has been taking place in other Salish
                     languages as well to varying degrees.6

                             Nxaramxcin makes use of a set of locative prepositions to mark adjunct
                     arguments of location.         These locative prepositions have been previously
                     discussed in Kinkade 1974 and N. Mattina 2002, and are listed in (30).","[101, 102]"

                             The broad use of the term noun incorporation is best illustrated in Mithun
                      1984, who writes that “NI apparently arises as part of a general tendency in
                     language for V’s to coalesce with their non-referential objects” (p.891).            She
                     distinguishes four separate types of noun incorporation each with a different
                     function.   She claims (p.891) that in Type I noun incorporation, “the NI reflects a
                     reduction of [the object’s] individual salience within predicates”.          Type II NI is
                     used to “background arguments within clauses”.             Type III NI is used “as a
                     device for backgrounding old or incidental information within discourse”.              And
                     finally, Type IV NI has become a classificatory system in which “generic N’s are

                             Mithun’s first noun incorporation type is labelled lexical compounding.
                     She writes (p.848):
                             If a language exhibits any NI at all, it will contain basic lexical compounds.
                             Structurally, compounding consists of the derivation of a complex lexical
                             item from a combination of two or more stems. The constituent stems may
                             be of almost any grammatical class (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.), as may
                             the resulting compound. [...] The term ‘incorporation’ is generally used to
                             refer to a particular type of compounding in which a V and N combine to
                             form a new V. The N bears a specific semantic relationship to its host V - as
                             patient, location, or instrument.
                     Mithun comments on the inefficiency of allowing for identical expressions in a
                     language, and argues that languages incorporate nouns for a reason.                 With
                     respect to /exical compounding, Mithun (p.848—9) claims that “[s]ome entity,
                     quality, or activity is recognized sufficiently to be considered name-worthy in its
                     own right [...] The activity or quality designated by the NV compound is viewed
                     as a recognizable, unitary concept, rather than the chance co-occurrence of some
                     action or state and some entity”.       The noun in such a compound is non-specific
                     (i.e. non-referential) and, as a result, is not marked for the categories of
                     definiteness and number.         Mithun notes that the NV compound may be written as
                     separate words, as in the following examples from Kanjobal (Mayan) and Lahu

                     verb bake and the agentive suffix -er. Following Lieber’s framework (see 1992,
                     chapter 3), this formation would look (roughly) like the following:
                     (2)                 INI —_—_——
                                                [N] ———                     The diagram in (2) illustrates the combining of the morphemes bake and -er. The
                     morpheme bake is of the lexical category V, and -er is of the category N.
                     Assignment of heads within a word is parametrically determined; for English it is
                     (generally) the rightmost element.       This would indicate that -er is the head in (2).
                     The lexical category features of -er are passed on to the higher node via the
                     process of feature percolation, hence the dominant node marked is marked N
                     indicating that the combined morphemes bake and -er are of the category N.
                             The above example contains an independent stem combined with a
                     derivational affix. Lieber claims that the morphosyntactic features of derivational
                     morphemes can percolate to the next highest node.            Inflectional morphemes,
                     however, do not contain full categorial signatures like derivational morphemes.
                     Lieber (p.112) states that:
                             Only stem, bound bases, and derivational affixes will have full categorial
                             signatures. Inflectional affixes will be marked only with individual features
                             for which they contain specified values. [...] Features from inflectional
                             morphemes can never override features from their bases, but can only fill in
                             values unspecified in the categorial signatures of their bases. Inflectional
                             word formation is therefore additive in a way that derivational word
                             formation and compounding are not. A corollary of this is that while
                             derivational affixes may or may not be heads of their words, inflectional
                             affixes will never be heads.
                     Now consider an example involving an inflectional affix:

                     diagram indicates that the inflectional suffix -s contains the feature [+ plural], and
                     is marked to attach to stems of the category noun.          The stem baker does not
                     contain the feature [+ plural] and, as a result, this feature is able to percolate to the
                     dominating node.      Inflectional morphology is not, by nature, category-changing.
                     Thus, the category of the stem baker percolates to the dominant node of bakers,
                     and the form remains a noun.
                               Now that we have seen a brief illustration of word formation using
                     Lieber’s (1992) morpheme-based theory of morphology, I turn to a discussion of
                     Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology and indicate how the formation of the
                     same word, bakers, would take place.","[23, 24, 25]"

                              What I refer to as bound stems have been dubbed lexical suffixes by
                      Kinkade (1963), and more broadly lexical affixes in the Salish literature. The term
                      affix may be misleading here for those unfamiliar with the properties of lexical
                      affixation. An affix is generally associated with grammatical features reflecting
                     transitivity, voice, aspect, person, number, etc. On the contrary, lexical affixes do
                     not represent grammatical features, but rather lexical features usually, though not
                      exclusively, of the category N. With respect to word formation, the difference
                     between a lexical affix and an independent stem is that the independent stem can
                      serve as the sole base for word operations while a lexical affix cannot.           The lexical
                      affix must combine with an independent stem. Hence in this work, following
                     Black 1996, lexical affixes are referred to as bound stems while independent
                      stems are referred to as free stems.
                             Bound stems are an important part of word formation in Nxa?amxcin.
                     Kinkade (n.d.) lists approximately 100 bound stems (lexical suffixes) for
                     Nxaramxcin to which 3 more bound stems (lexical prefixes) can be added based
                     on the comparative work presented in an unpublished paper by A. Mattina
                     (1987). Kinkade’s list is diachronic as some of the bound stems listed have
                     become so lexicalized the semantics are no longer recoverable. The discussion to
                     follow takes a synchronic perspective, and many of the forms listed by Kinkade
                     have been excluded from the set of synchronic bound stems.","[363, 364]"

                      5.5.2 Quasi-Clefting
                             Kroeber (1999:365) describes quasi-clefting in Salish languages as
                      “fronting constructions in which the residue takes the form of some type of
                      subordinate clause other than a headless relative clause; the difference from
                     relative clauses may be in the inflection or in the initial particle or both”.
                             In Nxa?amxcin, quasi-cleft constructions are formed with a clefted element
                     appearing in initial position, followed by one of the subordinating particles, tu? or
                      ci, followed by a relative clause which is optionally marked by the oblique marker
                      t. This is schematized in (113):

                             Some examples of quasi-clefted transitive subjects are given below.
                     (Clefted elements are in boldface; relative clauses are marked by square
                     brackets.):

                     In (114), the subject argument John appears in initial position, followed by the
                     subordinating particle #u?, which is followed by a relative clause.            In example
                     (115), the subject John is also clefted, but in this example it is followed by the
                     subordinating particle ci. With the exception of example (115), none of the
                     above examples contain an oblique marker preceding the residue of the quasi-
                     cleft. Omission of the oblique marker is the more common pattern in the data.
                     (Recall that transitive subjects are sometimes marked oblique in Nxa?amxcin,
                     hence the oblique marker in (116).)
                             Transitive objects can also be quasi-clefted, as shown in the following
