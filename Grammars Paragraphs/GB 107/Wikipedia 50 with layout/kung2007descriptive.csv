The full form of the tag question ta7as occurs only clause-finally, as seenbelow in the examples in (785), and it adds a tag question onto the end of theclause.(785) a.      tataqoxchoqoy                             ta7as

                                           575
           Though the tag question clitic +7as is a reduced form of the full tag ta7as,its distribution is different. Whereas ta7as occurs only clause-finally, +7ascliticizes onto the end of verbs (786), adverbs (787), and the negative particlejaantu (788) regardless of their positions within the clause. When the tag questioncliticizes onto a verb or adverb, it may be translated as a tag question, e.g., ‘didn’tit?’, ‘doesn’t it?’, or as ‘right?’ in English and ‘¿verdad?’ in Spanish. When +7ascliticizes onto the negative particle, the result is a negative question, ‘didn’t +clause’. Neither variant (ta7as or +7as) is used more frequently than the other,and the choice of which to use seems to lie with the speaker.","[599, 600, 601]"

Eventhough the application of the term ‘irrealis’ varies from language to language (orauthor to author), nevertheless, there are certain constructions which tend to getlabeled irrealis over and over again. Chafe lists the following contexts in which alanguage might employ the irrealis mood: yes-no questions, negations, futures,necessities (or obligations), possibilities, imperatives, prohibitions, and conditions(p. 350, 362).

           In all modalities but one, the irrealis mood is morphologically marked bythe prefix ka- or its allomorph 7a-. According to Watters (1988), in Huehuetla
                                          245
Tepehua, the irrealis prefix ka- is used when the subject is third person or firstperson plural inclusive, and the allomorph 7a- is used when the subject is firstperson singular, first person plural exclusive, and second person (p. 273). I, too,found that the allomorph 7a- can be used when the subject is first person singular,first person plural exclusive, or second person; however it is frequently the casethat no irrealis prefix at all occurs with these persons. My consultant, don Nicolás,told me that it is more correct to include the 7a- prefix, but that it is usuallyomitted in fast speech. In fact, I found that it almost never occurs in naturallyoccurring speech, but that it is always accepted when presented during elicitation.","[269, 270, 271]"

6.4.3 Temporal Adverbial Clitics        There are two temporal adverbial clitics in HT: +ch (ALD) ‘already’ and+ka7 (JST) ‘just’. I analyze these two morphemes as clitics rather than affixesfollowing criteria offered by Zwicky and Pullum (1983). First, these two clitics“exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their hosts” (p. 503); they mayaffix to nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and negative particles. These clitics areaffixed to words only after all morphosyntactic (derivational and inflectional)operations have applied. And unlike inflectional and derivational affixes, theseclitics do not have a morphophonemic effect on the words to which they cliticize.","[480, 481, 482]"

It is only used in the first person context and never in the second or thirdperson contexts. Kaa occurs quite commonly in both Tlachichilco Tepehua andPisaflores Tepehua; in both varieties it means ‘probably’ (Jim Watters, p.c.)       The epistemic particle kaa is not as ubiquitous as the evidential reportedspeech particle maa; in fact, it occurs in fewer than one-eighth of the clauses inthe text database (whereas maa occurs in more than half of the clauses). Likemaa, kaa occurs most frequently before verbs, though it may occur anywhere inthe clause. Examples are shown below in (625). In (625a), kaa occurs before the

Only after I asked the speaker to repeat him- or herself, would he or she includethe first person prefix, and it usually took more than one emphatic repetitionbefore the [k]+C combination was auditorily perceptible, especially when k-preceded another stop. In the emphatic repetition, don Nicolás and Micaela bothwould use the k- prefix, (74a) and (74b), respectively.

been syllabified with the preceding particle, as seen in the example in (75). In thisexample, the focus particle waa precedes the verb. It is frequently the case that k-is syllabified as the coda of this particle, as seen in (71b) above. However, in theclause shown here in (75), the k- is simply omitted. Though the gloss says ‘I
killed it’, the verb maqniilhch [maqnit] is not marked for first person andliterally means ‘He killed it’. This process of omission does not fall out from thesyllabification rules given in (68).","[126, 127]"

"6.4.3.1 ‘Already’ +ch        The temporal adverbial clitic +ch (ALD) is used more frequently than anyother clitic or affix in the language, occurring in approximately one-third of theclauses in the text database. It may cliticize onto verbs in any aspect, as well asonto adverbs, nouns, predicative adjectives, demonstrative pronouns, and thenegative particle. However, its meaning is not transparent. Though I have labeledit (ALD) for ‘already’, it adds this temporal meaning to a verb only in the perfect
aspect, as seen below in the examples in (628).",[482]

It can be used to pragmatically focus any constituent oradjunct in any declarative clause that introduces new information or a new idea tothe discourse. When it appears in a clause that is not an answer to a question, itprecedes the clausal element in situ; that is, a focused clausal constituent is not
required to occur in clause-initial focus position in this construction if it is not theanswer to a question. The following examples demonstrate that waa may focus insitu a predicate (754); a noun or a predicate nominal (755), a predicate adjective(756), an adverb (757), a prepositional phrase (758), and a number (759).","[581, 582]"
"         Above I mentioned that the focus particle does not influence the wordorder of the clause.

"          Examples of syllabification as a coda of the first person subject prefix k-are shown below in (71). In (71a), the /k/ has been syllabified as the coda of thepreceding adverb, and in (71b), the /k/ has been syllabified as the coda of thepreceding particle. Evidence for syllabification of the prefix as a coda is found inthe form of an audible release after the [k] in both forms in (71). In theseexamples, the [k] behaves more like a word-final stop (in that it is released) than aword-initial stop (which is not released). In contrast, the word-initial [k] in theexamples shown in (70) above is not released preceding another consonant inonset position. This process of syllabifying the k- prefix as the coda of thepreceding word or particle conforms to the syllabification rules shown above in(68) in that an unsyllabified consonant will be put into coda position before it willbe put into a consonant cluster in onset position.(71) a.

"           Second, the pattern of split intransitivity in Huehuetla Tepehua is anelusive one because inanimate nominals are not obligatorily marked for pluralitynor are inanimate arguments obligatorily co-indexed on the verb.

When I tried to inflect soqnik’a with the third person plural subjectmarker ta-, my consultant rejected the example, shown in (564e). The example in(564f) shows that the predicative adjective is pluralized by means of the pluralprefix lak- when the subject of the predicate is plural. The examples in (564g) and(564h) are interesting because they demonstrate that when the copula is used, theadverbial form soq is used instead of the adjectival form soqnik’a; this could bedue to a restriction on the part of speech of words that may precede a verb giventhat the syntactic position immediately before the verb is normally occupied by anadverb, an adverbial particle, a noun, or a discourse marker.(564) a.     soq        7an           juu paalhtan

suggests to me that this instance of maa is actually a conjunction that is similar tothe evidential clitic maa due either to homophony or to some historical changethat is not clear from a synchronic point of view. This could be the case becausewhen my consultant loosely translated passages that contained the particle maa,he would translate maa as either y ‘and’ or segun ‘according to’. However, when Iasked for a specific translation of maa, he always translated it as segun. When Iexplicitly tried to elicit a conjunction using conjoined clauses or phrases inSpanish, my consultant would either use the Spanish conjunction y in the HTclause or he would juxtapose the two clauses or phrases. He never used maa inelicited examples. For this reason, I continue to gloss maa as the evidentialparticle RPT in the examples that appear below in (833) and (834).","[642, 643]"

However, omission of theinterrogative pronoun is not limited to yes/no questions; it also occurs to a muchlesser extent in either/or, quantity, and open-ended questions, as seen in theexamples in (782), (783), and (784), respectively. In all examples, theinterrogative nature of the clauses is indicated by rising intonation.","[598, 599]"
"8.2 FOCUS       Huehuetla Tepehua has two strategies by which a clausal element may befocused. I use the term ‘focus’ here to mean prominence rather than contrastiveemphasis. The first strategy involves syntactic focus constructions, specifically
left-dislocation   and   clefting   (section   8.2.1).   The   second   strategy   ismorphosyntactic, involving the use of the focus particle waa (section 8.2.2).",[574]

"3.1.1 Person and Number Marking        Person and number are co-referenced on the Tepehua verb by prefixation,suffixation, glottalization, and suppletion. Person marking consists of first,second, and third; number consists of singular, simple plural, multiple plural, andfirst person plural inclusive and exclusive. The categories of third person andsingular are not marked overtly on the verb; instead they are the default readingswhen there is no overt person or number morphology on the verb stem. Given thatthere is no case marking on the noun in HT and that there is only one set of freepronouns, grammatical relationships in HT are distinguished by means of wordorder of the major constituents, discourse pragmatics, and pronominal cross-referencing on the verb. The word order (which is both pragmatic and relativelyfixed) is discussed in chapter 8, section 8.1. Pronominal cross-referencing is thetopic of this section.",[199]
"           Furthermore, it is quite common for speakers to omit the first personprefix altogether when the subject is first person singular and when the contextmakes it clear that the subject is first person singular. The example in (196a) ispart of a first person narration from a traditional story. Though the gloss says ‘Ikilled it’, the verb maqniilhch is not marked for first person and literally means‘He killed it’. If the k- prefix had been affixed to the verb in this example, itwould have been syllabified as the coda of the preceding particle waa. The verb in(196b) does not bear the first person subject prefix either, but it does bear prefixes70 Please see Chapter 2, Section 2.4 on HT syllable structure.",[203]
