"Where they have a positive imperative function, punctual
aspect marking on participles highlights a verb-like status

negative participle imperati-:.::s are expressed by attaching
the nominal Privative suffix -neten to the unmarked stem of
the participle, thereby highlighting a nominal-like status

used as a greeting corresponding to mamak 'goodbyef. It

yaray or ri'ya are inaproppriate responses. Non-polar
interrogation involves so-called 'WH' questions, in which an
interrogative element of some type is required in the quest-
ion, and which defines what is being questioned.",[300]
"
3 Th1rd person singular indicative perfective subject has
zero morphological realization, and verbs marked for this
value are thus slightly exceptional. Substitution with
another prefix form is available for strict word class
determination, however (see Figures 7-1 and 7-2 below, and
Chapter 7 generally).
4.3      ParticiplesParticiples form an open class which 4 s functionally quite
complex, having various features of nominals, adverbs and
verbs.   However, they are simply identified formally and
syntactically: they can be suffixed with the Dative, Ablat-
ive and Allative case suffixes to express adclausal comp-
lements; they can occur in a clause with a verb, marked for
Punctual or Sequential aspect and, when transitive, can have
an overt nominal object argument; they can be suffixed with
the nominal privative marker to express negative imperative
utterances; they can be suffixed with the nominal comitative
suffix to function as predicates of another nominal; and
they can occur alone, either unmarked or marked for punctual
aspect, as positive imperatives.","[109, 110]"
"     'WH' questions are introduced with a clause-initial interro-
     gative element of some type.    These are from various word
     classes, and their approximate meanings are as follows:
     dyalan 'what1,dyamba 'when', baniqa '(say) what, (do) what'
     and barri 'QUESTION'.    barri is an interrogative proform
     root for suffixes which create meanings such as 'where from'
     and 'who' for the stem. baniqa is a participle. All 'WH'
     interrogative items are described in following sections.     10.3.1   dyamba 'when'     The relationship between dyamba 'when' and the same form
     with an Irreakis negative meaning described in 10.1.1 above
     is unclear; there is no evidence suggesting either homonymy
     or an original polysemy. As an interrogative form, dyamba
     questions the time of a predicate activity which has not yet
     taken place, and thus carries irrealis meaning.",[301]
"One difference that can be distinguished is illocutionary,
and participle-only participles seem to have more imperative
force than finite verb+participle forms.     Participle-only
imperatives have the effective discourse status of inter-
jections, and carry a relatively high amount of illocution-
ary force. Their brevity (never more than four syllables,
even for the negative forms and carrying only one tonic
stress) also permits them to be uttered with a great deal of
articulary force in any conversational exchange or speech
situation. In 9-36 and 9-39 where a participle-only impera-
tive occurs in the same utterance as a finite verb+partic-
iple imperative, the former construction occurs as the last
item in the sentence. In this position it has the illocut-
ionary effect of reinforcing the command expressed in the
finite clause, providing strong force for the utterance as a
whole. 49.4      Participles and aspect markingApart from Punctual marking in participle-only imperative
utterances, participles can be marked for Punctual or Sequ-
ential aspect in non-imperative finite clauses, and for
Punctual aspect in imperative finite clauses. In all cases,
the aspect marked on the participle functions as aspect
marking for the clause as a whole. It is thus possible for
participles to be marked for aspect while the finite verb in
the clause is marked only for tense or mood; the converse
situation also occurs.    Aspect marking on participles is   In 9-36 particularly, the use of buy' 'do completely' has
an effect similar to the tag 'Okay?' following some English
imperatives, such as, for example, 'Just do it, okay?'. The
direct illocution here is of a question, although it has the
indirect illocution of reinforcing the command rather than
genuinely rsqcesting a response; any response at all ought
only to take the form of an agreement.
outside the mood/tense/aspect system of finite verbs dis-
cussed in chapter 7 , and participles do not fall within any
scoping contra1 of the finite verb or each other.","[276, 277]"
"     In such examples, the distinction between the question and
     Irrealis negative interpretation of the sentence is through
     its intonation contour.
10,3.2   dya'an    'what'Apart from questioning 'what', dya'an can be suffixed with
the Dative case marker -gu to mean 'what for, why', or the
Ablative case marker -gunda to mean' 'what from':10-44    dya'an     maDan
         what       this
          What is this? '10-45    dya'an     gwnit    gi-ga                  [LMD 2851

         'What are you sick from. I10,3.3   baniqa '(do) vhat, (say) what'This participle has the interrogative sense of 'what', but
rather than questioning an argument of a clause, it quest-
ions the verb or predicate. When used alone, without a
finite verb, it can mean 'What did you say?, or 'What is
this called?', in what is essentially an idiomatic function:10-48    banirga     ma'an;         Yanbulloo station Vestey's
                                        II              It         !I

         say what
         'What did you say?'
However, when baniqa occurs in a finite verb clause, it
requests information about the action, process or state
described by the finite verb. Such a function is quite rare
in Australian languages generally, in which similar inter-
rogation is usually expressed only by case-marked indefinite
nominals (Dixon 1980:372pp).    A similar contrast between
interrogation of the verb action and an argument of the verb
also occurs in Waray, however (Harvey 1986:93). baniga can
thus be translated as either 'how' or 'what':10-50    baniqabaniqa    gu-yu           matyin     ma'an      dupa

formation.concerning 'who' and 'where'. When suffixed with
the form -miya it means 'who1, and can be further marked
with case suffixes to express various grammatical relations:10-53    barri-miya   ga'an   lagiban    9-di-nya-vu

"In fact, this particular problem touches upon the wider
problem of underlying structures which it is worth discus-
sing here.   In many sentences which contain finite verbs,
actants in the clause do not occur expressed as overt nomin-
als or pronouns, but have reference only in the verbal pre-
fix. If it is assumed that phrase structures (or any other
type of basic structures) are composed of obligatory NP
slots which are cross-referenced onto the verb, then some
sort of reduction rule would have to apply to a majority of
clauses.   Such a rule is not improbable, but it has been
shown in other sections (cf. 7.1) that the pronominal func-
tion of prefixes is not necessarily cross-referencing.
Moreover, overt nominal reference to participants is often
used for presenting new information, or for other discourse
strategies (cf. 11.2 above); the unmarked
                                     .,.    structure in num-
erical and discourse terms is to have no overt nominal ref-
erence and such a rule would therefore seem to be unmotivat-
ed.   Rather than considering a basic underlying sentence
structure to be one where NP slots are initially filled,
usually by pronouns, with mapped features in the finite verb
prefix (which, in any case is not always true, cf. examples
8-1 to 8-4), and which are then typically emptied again by
the application of some sort of deletion rule, it is more
economical and appropriate to propose that the reverse holds
true. In this case, underlying clause structure would have
slots in the verb prefix filled first, with an optional
restatement of the prefix as overt nominal arguments in
response to discourse requirements.      Such an approach to
languages similar in type to Wagiman has been discussed by
Jelinek (1985).","[341, 342]"
"10,2       InterjectionsInterjections are few in number and include mamak 'goodbye',
and yaray 'yes1 and ri'ya 'no' which are used in response to
polar questions.   The short forms yu and yo are used for
'yes' in response to requests for attention or when being
addressed. ri'ya also occurs with the nominal gala 'very'
to reinforce the negation, or to mean, 'I don't know', for
example :10-38    wi'ya   gala,     dyilimakun    ganiggin

         'I don't know.'wi'ya has also been recorded in a small number of examples
with the form ga to mean 'do not want (to do)'.    The few
recorded examples provide no clue of the status of ga as
either a suffix or a word, nor any evidence of its possible
wider meaning. It is not glossed in the following example:10-40   rilya qa        gongonay-gu     [LMD 6851
        no    2         talk-DAT
        .'I don't want to talk (I am going to go to
        sleep). 'The tag form gale occurs commonly in final position in
questions, and, uttered with a rising intonation contour,
has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the
question by the addressee. Few examples occurred in record-
ing sessions because speakers tended not to ask questions
themselves. A typical example occurred in the question
(often addressed to me by speakers at Rybrook Farm) 'The
others have gone to get food, haven't they?', the point of
which was to ask politely whether they could get a ride into
town or not. A reply 'no' or 'not yet' would then be fol-
lowed by a request for a lift as well:

         3pl:PFV-go-PAST     food-DAT     TAG
         'They have all gone to get food, haven't they?'gale is also able to occur alone in response to statements
by other speakers. In this way, it has the sense of, ' Is
that so?', or, 'Really?'.","[298, 299, 300]"
"    115.1   General considerations    Wagiman finite verb participle constructions display some
    structural similarities to multi-part predicate construct-
    ions in other languages in the region, in which one element
    inflects for mood and/or tense and/or pronominal reference,
    and the other is uninflected and perhaps not obligatory; in
    many of these languages, the terms 'auxiliary' and '(main)
    verb' or 'particle', or other terminological variants, are
    used to describe the various elements.     Often, the 'part-
    icle' is not free, and is connected in some way to the 'aux-
    iliary. Constructions relatively similar to those found in        See, for example, Reid 1982, Heath 1978a, 1980c, 1981,
    Tryon 1974, 1976, Merlan 1982, and also other descriptions
    in Dixon 1976:613-768.
Wagiman occur in Mangarayi, where the non-inflec.ting ele-
ments, described as 'particles', are free items and are not
attached phonologically or morphologically to their I aux-
iliary' (Merlan 1982:52). 4Functional similarities between Mangarayi particles and
Wagiman participles are broad, but differences are also
clearly discernable, particularly in the lack of aspect
marking on Mangarayi particles, and the semantic dominance
of the particle in expressing the meaning of the verbal
construction (op. cit.:124),Nevertheless, a simple 'particle + auxiliary' analysis is
essentially unsatisfactory for Wagiman because it fails to
take into account the fact that participles are quite dis-     '
tinct predicates in their ability to have individual object
and subject arguments; the transitivity of a clause can be
altered by the transitivity of the participle, and in
already transitive clauses, a further overt nominal argument
can be introduced into the clause (see 9.2.1; transitivity
has also been discussed in 6.2.1).  Moreover, the subject or.
agent of participles and the finite verb in a clause need
not be identical, as in switch subject and multiple object
constructions, while in some others (ambient constructions),
participles share no arguments at all with the finite verb
(again, see 9.2.1 above).   In a 'particle + aux' structure,
the particle is assumed to have the same arguments as the
aux, and the two are given effectively as a unit verbal
constituent; this is clearly not the case in Wagiman parti-
ciple structures,
* In the Pama-Nyungan language Warlpiri , spoken well to the
south of both Wagiman and Mangarayi, some 'adverbial pre-
verbs' can also be separated from their 'main verb' , either
to a position directly following the verb instead of direct-
ly preceding it, or to sentence-final position (Nash 1982:
180-1).
Furthermore, the participle and finite verb combine to form
semantically productive, complex lexical meanings, and
neither finite verbs nor participles can be said consistent-
ly to carry more of the semantic load than the other; the
finite verb is more than just a 'prop1 for inflection (an
auxiliary) as in Mangarayi (Merlan 1982:52).       In simple
finite clauses, in which a finite verb occurs without a
participle, any 'aux' function to be defined at all is car-
ried, not by the verb root, but the prefix: it is marked
for tense and mood and occurs in first position, satisfying
two out of the three characteristics of ' A U X ' defined by
Steele et al. (1981:155-6). The third characteristic, that
aux occurs as a constituent, is more problematic on a level
of theoretical syntax not under discussion here.    In finite
participle clauses, the logical candidate for any auxiliary
remains the same. In all cases, finite verbs are lexically
full items, and remain so in participle clauses. Some other
approach is required.","[332, 333, 334]"
"10.1     AdverbsAdverbs form a small closed class whose members have a rel-
atively limited range of meanings. Their semantic functions
include the expression of sentential mood values, such as
negation, doubt and non-completion of the activity described
by the verb or predicate. Also included is a group of non-
deictic locating expressions which indicate the spatial
position of one NP relative t r ~another, such as 'on top' ,
'behind' and so on.    In a notional definition of adverbs
these words would be excluded from membership in the class
because they do not modify a verb or a sentence. Scme mean-
ings expressed by Wagiman adverbs would be included in three
distinct word classes in some other Australian languages,
described as 'adverbals', 'locational qualifiers' and 'part-
icles' (Dixon 1980:281-84).    'Locational qualifiers' des-
cribed by Dixon can often be inflected, however, although
'particles' are usually uniuflecting (ibid.).     The class
designated by Dixon as 'adverbals' have the same morpho-
logical possibdlites as verbs, and thus do not corespond to
Wagiman 'adverbs'. It should be recalled that the primary
criteria for the definition of word classes given in Chapter
4 were grammatical:    distribution, range of possible syn-
tactic functions and specifiable morphological categories.
Despite their apparently disparate meanings, Wagiman
'adverbs' are classified together because of their similar
grammatical characteristics; the term 'adverb' is chosen
because a major notional function of the class is, in fact,
the modification of verbs and clauses.101.1   dyamba 'cannot, rill not, do not'dyarba has three distinct meanings depending on grammatical
context: (i) it is used to express the subject or agent's
inability to carry out the activity expressed by the verb;
(ii) it marks a lack of desire to carry out this activity;
and (iii) in finite verb imperatives it marks a negative
        -
command not to carry out the activity (cf. 7.2.3).    Gener-
ally, context provides information to distinguish between
the 'lack of desire1 and 'inability' meanings; often, how-
ever, the distinction is not clear or contextually required,
and 'cannot' and 'will not' are indistinguishable. The
unifying feature of these three meanings is that they all
deny, apart from negating, the possibility expressed by the
predicate of the clause. dyamba is thus used only for
irrealis situations, and is thus glossed as 'Irrealis neg-
ative' (IRR NEG):10-1    ga-qa-bu      ga'an-ma   dyamba    gu-ya'-dya

Example 10-3 provides some context for the hearer to decide
that the speaker (an old man, moreover) means that he cannot
go because he is sick. This state would seem to imply also
that he does not want to go, but the primary reason would
appear to be one of inability. Taken out of. context, the
following example (10-4) could also mean either 'I do not
want to go (and I shall not)', or 'I cannot go (and I shall
not)'. At the time of its utterance, either translation was
possible, and appeared to be equally appropriate; both seem-
ed to be intended simultaneously, in fact, and is typical of
examples where inability and lack of desire are inseparable
in the mind of the speaker. 10-4 was produced by George
Huddleston Yalkpayarri in response to the suggestion that he

osition expressed in the clause. It is never used with
imperative. or other Potential mood-marked verbs (which are
negated with dyamba).   It usually occurs in clause-initial
position:10-5     wudyi   ga-ya'             ganq-ma            ga'an    lagiban

10,1,3   menuny 'perhaps'menuny expresses doubt regarding the reality or truth of the
entire clause, and has, therefore, consistent translations
into English of 'perhaps' or 'might be'. It usually occurs
in sentence- or clause-initial position. Examples 10-8 and
10-9 are typical. In 10-8 (also given as 6-75 above), the
non-initial occurrence of menuny in the first clause ref-
lects a focussing of the nominal goruty-garrag in order to
contrast it with matal-yi-garrag in the second clause, in
which menuny occurs in initial position:10-8     goruty-garrag    menuny         g-di-nya                matan

can, or is obliged to, undertake the activity expressed by
the verb. manya does not clearly distinguish between obli-
gation and ability, and can be compared with dyamba, where
lack of desire and inability are both expressed by the same
form. There is often some difficulty in translation of
manya because of the indeterminacy between 'ought' and
'can'. On other occasions it also means 'allowed to', with
the implication that this permission represents an obligat-
ion of some sort; in such examples, Potential mood prefixes
are used.   manya does not always occur in clause-initial
position:10-10    qigun   manya   gongona     mi-yu         [LMD 2851

'later', have a complementary distribution:     the 'tried'
interpretation is only available in clauses with past time
reference, while the 'later' interpretation is only avail-
able in non-past time clauses. A common feature of clauses
containing gorro is that the action expressed by the pred-
icate at the time of utterance is not achieved, or 'real':
in past time reference, the activity is attempted but unsuc-
cessful; in non-past time, the action is stated as going to
occur at some later time.gorro also usually occurs in clause- or sentence-initial
position.10-13    gorro dyoro            ma-di ,      menung      dina,

10.1.6   goko 'again, still'The 'again' and 'still' interpretations of goko are depend-
ent on context and are usually easily distinguished.      In
clauses with present time reference, both 'still' or 'again'
can be appropriate translations. goko occurs primarily, but
not always, in clause-initial position:
                                                                    ,.

10-20 it occurs without a participle:10-19    goko  yurrup,   mi-di                  4anW

predicate action being described can be considered as creat-
ing a state which will not change in the future (as in 'go-
ing for good'), or that it occurs all the time. Often, no
distinction in interpretation can be made between 'all the
time' and 'for good', as in 10-21 where either '(for) all
the time' or 'for good' are appropriate. In other examples,
context again distinguishes the two interpretations.","[287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294]"
"5.3.5    Possessive functionThe Oblique pronouns contrast subtly with the Possessive
pronouns. Unlike the Possessive pronouns themselves, which
express possession directly, the Oblique pronouns imply a
more indirect possessive relation, usually translated into
English with the phrase 'of mine', 'of yours' etc. They are
also used to express the idea of 'belonging to', inasmuch as
this means 'associated with'.",[125]
"The class of interjections includes the words wi'ya 'no' and
yaray 'yes'. There is also a word gale which generally
occurs in clause-final position as a tag question, but can
also occur alone to mean 'Is that true?' or 'Really?'. Its
word class membership is thus somewhat difficult to define,
but is described with interjections in 10.2 below.",[287]
"A major problem is found in a lack of evidence in the lang-
uage for any 'basic word order', defined as that which holds
in 'stylistically-neutral, independent, indicative clauses
with full noun phrase participants for Si or for A and 0'
(Mallinson and Blake 1981:125).     As for other languages
which represent Si, A and 0 in the verb or by clitics, it is
extremely rare for Wagiman sentences to contain free nominal
expressions of both A and 0, or even Si, providing little
evidence for statements about 'basic' order (op. cit.:129).",[312]

"Methods of collecting data varied as the research advanced,
and also with speakers; some speakers needed little prompt-
ing, while others had to be provided with quite clear source
material, usually in English, before they would produce
utterances or material in Wagiman. Most language sessions
after 1983 were tape recorded; some in 1983 were recorded,
but others transcribed verbatim, as speakers were distracted
by the presence of the tape recordere Direct translations
of English sentence prompts have been treated with some mis-
givings, depending on their complexity and the linguistic
point they are designed to illustrate, as well as some
doubtful examples from 1983 which were not tape-recorded;
these were often used in later research as a means of elic-
iting case forms or other morphology. Throughout the des-
cription, where a direct translation from English is given
as an example, its status as such is mentioned. The prob-
lems with these examples are usually contextual, and while
most elicited examples provided can be considered fully
'grammatical', they can appear somewhat unnatural. None of
the speakers I worked with could be persuaded to provide
traditional texts or stories, and rarely even longer non-
traditional material, although George Huddleston Yalkpayarri
would occasionally narrate what might have been traditional
material in Kriol; it was, however, not easy to comprehend
                      *
    him when he spoke this language.     After much difficulty,
    some longer narrative texts were recorded in 1984 and 1985,
    and these appear in the Appendix. They effectively comprise
    all of the longer narrative material available.","[27, 28]"
"10.1.9   Positional adverbsThe positional adverbs are 'non-deictic locating express-
ions' (after Fillmore 1982:43), which specify the position
of a nominal or noun phrase in respect of another nominal or
other contextually understood item.    Nominals modified by
adverbs in this way are marked with the Locative or Pergres-
sive case suffixes.    Not all the positional adverbs have
been recorded with both movement and static position verbs,
however, and while forms meaning 'in front', 'behind' and
'around' occurred freely, no word meaning 'between' was
recorded either. It is not clear whether the idea of 'be-
tween' is expressed in some other fashion, or merely that it
is a gap in the collected corpus of adverbs.10,1.9,1 yoggona 'in.front1,dyumbany 'behind'These two adverbs have temporal and ordinal values, as well
as being able to describe location or position.     yoggona
thus means 'in front', 'first', or 'before', while dyumbany
means 'last', 'behind' or 'afterwards1,depending on context
and the meaning of the verb or predicate in the clause:10-25      qagun     yoggona    ga-rinyi-0      ,     qagun    buluman

"Interference from English, however, still cannot be ruled
out as the source of the DEM N order particularly. The
function of the medial demonstrative ga'an 'that, there' as
a definite article, and its occurrence before a head nomi-
nal, were discussed in 5.4.1.2 as possibly reflecting a bor-
rowing from English. The innovative use of ga'an in such a
way could have caused a general shift of the other demons-
tratives to the same order position. None of the speakers
whose language was recorded was brought up outside the inf-
luence of English, and whether the original situation was as
currently indicated cannot now be determined.",[307]
"This provides a minimal number of five classes only in Wagi-
man: those that can carry case suffixes and co-occur with
VERBS are NOMINALS; those that can carry pronominal prefixes
and tense and aspect suffixes, and which can eithep occur
alone or with one or two NOMINALS are VERBS; those that do
not carry pronominal prefixes, but carry aspect marking and
I
    which can occur alone or with VERBS and NOMINALS are PART-
I
    ICIPLES; those that do not carry any affixation at all and
    which occur with VERBS are ADVERBS, while those which can
    occur alone as whole utterances are INTERJECTIONS.
I    However, such a classification is mechanical and coarse; it
    fails to shed any light on the more subtle functional and
    other, often semantic, differences that can be determined
    within particular classes.    A broader description of word
    classes would also be able to define sub-classes on ling-
    uistically relevant grounds. For example, the class of
    Adverbs can be divided into sub-classes on the basis of
    whether they code mood (negation, doubt) or other categories
    (time, manner, position).  In this case the sub-classificat-
    ion is semantic.","[104, 105]"
"5.4.3   Deictic directional adverbsThe proximal form manan and the medial form ganan are trans-
cribed as /manan/ and /ganan/ respectively, although both
bear a striking similarity to the proximal and medial deic-
tic demonstratives m'an and gatan. The lack of a recorded
phonetic glottal stop prevents them from being transcribed
similarly as *mamanan and *garanan, but the comparison leads
to the strong possibility that they are formally related in
some way. They are relatively rare forms in isolation,
although, as stated above, the distal form malan is more
common with the distal demonstrative magu. Hand gestures or
other overt methods of indicating the exact direction are
also often given simulataneously with their use. They refer
to directions which have an apparent end point, or locus of
relevance (a place or object), which the speaker assumes the
hea~erknows about, but they differ from the deictic demons-
tratives by implying a particular direction.
5.4-3.1    manan [Proximal]      'this ray'manan is usually used to indicate a direction or way close
to the speaker, so that it can mean 'this way', or 'by this
way which is close to me heref:5-52      qagun   manan       ma-ya           [DJM 3841

point is some distance away from the speaker, for example:5-53      ganan      magu     guda       [LMD685]

Chapter 6       Nominal suffixing morphology6.1        Preliminary remarks                                 \
Nominals can be suffixed with a range of case and other
suffixes to express a wide variety of grammatical relations.
In many descriptions of Australian languages two types of
nominal suffixes are usually distinguished, often defined as
'inflectional1 and 'derivational', even though the 'derivat-
ional' suffixes are not necessarily involved in altering
'part-of-speech' membership.   This is explicitly stated in
Dixon (1980:322-3) in the following way:      'Each word has an obligatory root and final inflec-
      tion; between these two constituents there can
      optionally occur one or more of a number of deri-
      vational suffixes. Some will de~ivea stem with a
      different part-of-speech membership from that of
      the original root; other derivational affixes will
      not affect syntactic function.'","[138, 139, 140, 141]"
"However, it is likely that the neutralization of lpl and 2sg
forms generally would also cause problems, particularly for
the lpl/2sg and 2pl/lsg functions (giqgu-, giqgu-, miggu-)
in questions such as, for example, 'Who is going to get
meat? Are you (pl) getting meat for us, or are we getting
meat for you (sg)?'    Unfortunately, the lack of recorded
conversational material in the language makes the normal
method of resolution of such potential problems difficult to
state. In the few recorded examples of giqgu- (it is a
relatively rare form insone-to-one language sessions because
in all its references, one actant is lpl), it occurred with
an overt Ergative case marked agent, or an unmarked (Abso-
lutive) pronominal patient. The lpl inclusive suffix q a n a
can also be used in intransitive clauses to indicate explic-
itly that the agent referent is lpl, but is structurally
ambiguous in transitive clauses when it occurs without overt
nominals to indicate the grammatical function of its refer-
ent (cf. 6.4.3).",[221]

"This is an extremely rare response to the greeting maman?
'Are you well?'; speakers usually replied with the inter-
jection ilkam ' indeed'   .Equational clauses without part-
iciples do not require any verb at all, and this particular
response with yu-gin could be a calque from English. The
speaker who often used this phrase is a Jawony woman (now
deceased), but who was also fluent in Wagiman.",[247]
"        However, the Desiderative prefix is restricted to use only
        on verbs which have a lsg nominal marked in the prefix.
        A further resultant restriction of meaning is thus to aspec-
        tually unmarked Indicative mood, because of the aspect cont-
        rast neutralization for lsg forms. The above examples show
        that the lsg nominal can be in any grammatical function in
        both transitive and intransitive finite verbs. The restric-
        tion to lsg reference is presumably due to a grammaticalized
        pragmatic restraint, whereby speakers are unable to state
        another person's intention unless they are closely involved
        in the action. Such close involvement apparently means
        being either S, A or 0 in grammatical terms, and partici-

less well recorded than the deictic demonstratives. It
occurs most commonly in textual and other unelicited mater-
ial, and only rarely in elicited examples. The common con-
texts for its use are situations of unstructured conversat-
ion, and in utterances which have enough preceding context
to permit discourse anaphora.   The more formal linguistic
contexts in which speakers often provided data reduced its
occurrence.dya'an is more commonly used as an interrogative or indefin-
ite nominal meaning 'what' or 'which' (see 10.3.2).      Its
demonstrative and interrogative uses seem to be linked sem-
antically in the same way that 'what' can be used both as an
interrogative particle and a relative pronoun in English.
In Wagiman the anaphoric use of dya1an to modify a nominal
in an NP signals that the speaker is referring to an item
assumed to be known by the hearer, for example, 'the man
that (I referred to before)'. Once an item has been specif-
ied using one of the three deictic demonstratives, it is
then possible to refer to it later in a discourse with the
anaphoric demonstrative. In a text or discourse placed in
the past, the usual first reference to a participant is with
ga'an, and subsequent reference can be with-dya'an.     When
dya'an is used without any preceding context, it marks its
referent as being one which the speaker presumes the hearer
already understands as having a given reference.dyalan has no distance features associated with it, and is
glossed as 'anaphora' (ANAPH).","[134, 135]"
"These sentences are thus not copula clauses of the same type
as the examples of ni-qin and yu-qin above. They do, how-
ever, have a strong equational nature; verbless equationalD
clauses are described in 11.3.
Chapter 9     Participle c=onstructionsMany languages spoken in the northern part of Australia have
clausal structures which involve more than one verbal ele-
ment.   In Wagiman, these structures typically comprise a
finite verb and one or more members of a distinct lexical
class of words called participles. However, participles can
also occur alone in some types of imperative utterances, as
well as functioning as nominal complements to an entire
clause.   Their status in the language seems to be unique
among other languages of the area, and indeed also in Aust-
ralia.","[250, 251]"
"Because of the low number of speakers, the great difficulty
in obtaining material and the poor outlook for the continued
survival of Wagiman, this grammar can be seen as what is
commonly known as a 'salvage description' in Australian
linguistics (see again, for example, the descriptions in
Dixon and Blake 1979, 1981 and 1983), in which a record is
made of the language before the last speakers die. In situ-
ations such as these, the amount of grammatical material
recorded is generally less than would be possible if a large
group of speakers were available, among whom the linguist
could record varying types of data, or choose among speakers
as teachers. To a certain extent, and because of these
difficulties, the amount of data recorded for Wagiman is not
complete, and some areas are better recorded than others.
Data on discourse strategies, narrative technique, conver-
sational and other competence data is certainly incomplete
in this sense, and many other interesting aspects of the
language have proved difficult to elicit in significant
numbers; lexical gaps in the corpus also occur because of
the fragmentary nature of the fieldwork. Where there is a
general lack of data, or only a small number of examples
have been recorded, then this is indicated.      It now also
appears that the best time for research on the language is
past, with the increasing ill-health of old speakers and the
difficulty in inducing others to provide material making
further serious research a doubtful possibility.","[39, 40]"
"        The only fact exhibited by these generalizations is that V .
        tended to follow any overt nominal that occurred; little
        else can be stated with certainty. A 'basic order' of the
        constituents Si, A, 0 and V cannot be determined from such
        data, both because of the lack of any favoured order, but
        also because of the lack of clauses containing two core NPs.
        Wagiman is thus a language for which sentence constituent
        typology is largely irrelevant, because of its lack of a
        basic word order. In conclusion, 'word order1 (the order of
        major constituents) in Wagiman must be described as 'free',
i       but in which the occurrence and order of elements is a func-
    ,
        tion of strong pragmatic constraints.

I
                constructions)        Simple sentences are those which contain only one predicate
        and are not logically linked to any other clause. Three
        types can be defined: (i) finit.e verb clauses; (ii) part-
        iciple imperative clauses; and (iii) verbless equational
        clauses. Finite clauses with participles are considered to
        be internally 'complex1; their morphology, function and
        semantics were described in Chapter 9, and their syntax is
        treated below in 11.5.
I
I   Participle-only imperatives were described in 9.3, and exam-
    ples of simple finite verb clauses were given in both Chap-
    ters 8 and 9. This section deals with verbless equational
    clauses only.","[317, 318]"
"Recently, Blake (ms.:120) has suggested that languages like
Wagiman are possibly amenable to a bi- or multi-clausal
analysis, where the 'auxiliary' (the finite verb) is des-
cribed as the main clause verb and the 'particle1 (the part-
iciple) as the verb of a dependent clause. Nevertheless,
Blake rejects a bi-clausal analysis for Maranungku (a Daly
River language) for various reasons, and it is also rejected
here for Wagiman.   Several reasons, some similar to those
proposed by Blake, contribute to this:       (1)    In ambient constructions, the participle has
no arguments at all, and it is difficult to know how to
provide a bi-clausal paraphrase for an example such as 11-43
   Whether the prefix is an inflectional category or a syn-
tactic constituent is a theoretically abstract question, and
will not be addressed in what is primarily a descriptive
grammar. Certainly, it is a morphologically obligatory
constituent of the finite verb complex.
(given above as 9/8) because it cannot mean 'I hit him and I

         [GHY 83 ]
         'I used to hit him in return.'      (ii)    As in Maranungku (reported in Blake ms. , from
data in Tryon 1976) the scope of sentence adverbials covers
the entire clause, including both. finite verb and particip-
le(~), not just one or the other. :n 11-44 and 11-45 (given
as 10/13 and 10/14 respectively above) the adverb gorro
'tried but failed, later' has scope over both items in each
clause, despite the difference in relative ordering: in
11-44 the participle follows the finite verb, while in 11-45
it precedes it.11-44   gorro dyoro      ma-di,                   [DJM 4841

     (iii)    The meaning of mood, tense or aspect suffixes
on any one of the partiples or the finite verb applies to
all the others as well (see 9.4 above). 11-44 above illust-
rates this, where the Desiderative mood marker on -ya- 'to
go' applies also to bew'ma 'cross', suggestive of the fact
that the participle and finite verb form a unit of some
sort, at least in semantic terms as was suggested in 9.2.","[334, 335]"
"        Because it is not possible to use the Desiderative prefix
        for clauses which have no 1st person reference involved in
        them, there is a potential gap in possibility of expression
        in this area.    However, the use of iterative aspect (see
        7.2.4.3) with the adverb gorro 'later, tried (but failed)'
        provides an interpretation of 'attempt' or 'intend' when
        there is no lsg nominal marked in the prefix.        7e2e3    Finite imperative utterances        Finite verb imperative utterances are not marked in any way
        morphologically, and are formally identical with 2sg or 2pl
    '   prefixed declarative finite verbs. The distinction between
        imperatives and other utterance types is based on intonat-
        ion and context: imperatives are uttered with relatively
        more loudness and pitch.    The Immediate future suffix can
        occur on verbs used as imperatives to indicate the speaker's
        desire that the action be undertaken at once. A second type
        of imperative, discussed in 9.3, can be formed with only a
        participle and no finite verb or nominal arguments.
The mood prefix' used for finite imperatives can be either
Imperfective or Potential, depending on the speaker's view
of the relative potentiality or factuality of the action
being described. Actions described or predicated in an
imperative utterance which are considered possible only are
expressed with the Potential prefixes, while those that are
considered real are expressed with the Imperfective, for
example :7-18     buy '                  mi-ga-dya               [DJM 4841

"    Despite the use of functional and grammatical criteria for
    the classification, names of word classes used here also
    tend to reflect notional and traditional usage. Consequent-
    ly, that class of words which includes those which express
    actions, processes and states is called the class of
    'verbs', although having this meaning is not a necessary
    condition for inclusion in this class; it will be seen, for
    example, that other syntactic and morphological criteria are
    necessary to distinguish the class of verbs from the class
    of 'participles'.",[105]
"    The Oblique pronouns have a variety of grammatical funct-
    ions, although these all (except (vi) below) seem to be
    linked by the 'obliqueness' of their referents' relationship
    with the clausal predicate; they can be summarized as fol-                  they specify the pronominal object complement
    of some intransitive verbs and clauses;                  they express the pronominal benefactive comp-
    lement of a verb or clause;                  they are used to express pronominal allative
    and locative complements of a clause, as well as the indi-
    rect addressee of the verb yawan 'to say';
                                                            101
          ( iv)   they express the topic of a story ('about
    someone') or the subject matter of an action or process;           (v)    they function as markers of possession in a
    manner similar to, but subtly different from, the Possessive
    pronouns; and          (Ti)    they occur marking an affected     pronominal
    patient in an apparent accusative function.","[119, 120]"
"The pronominal reference would be-affected by phonological
and lexical rules to produce the portmanteau form qan-, and    Similar proposals relating to 'predicators' in Warlpiri
 corresponding approximately to the category 'verb' in trad-
 tional grammar) have been made by Hale (1983), in which the
'lexical structure' of a predicator specifies the number of
arguments it can take, although none need necessarily appear
as overt nominals in phrase structure.

case suffixation on the agent is a pragmatic feature, like
the presence or absence of the full, nominal itself, *and is
not required in underlying structure. Rules for the expan-
sion of the pronominal slots would be quite simple: only
nominals agreeing in number and person could be employed.
Pronouns, by lexical definition, are marked for person and
number, while alJ other unmarked items (full nominals) would
be considered 3rd person only.        Examples where a 3pl free
nominal is represented in the verb by a 3sg prefix can be
considered a result of the relative newness of 3pl marking
in the prefix system (see 7 . 4 . 2 ) , which would originally
have specified 3rd person only, unmarked for number.","[342, 343]"
"The alternation between Imperfective and Potential mood for
the prefixes on the two finite verbs in 7-19 reflects the
speaker's view of the relative reality of the events being
described : the addressee in the first clause was actualj-y
messing around at the time of the utterance, and the command
to stop is in the indicative Imperfective to reflect this;
in the next clause, where there is a command to be quiet,
the predicated state of being quiet was only a potential
fact, and is therefore in the Potential mood.       Examples
7-20 and 7-21 also illustrate the way mood choice reflects
the speaker's view of reality, and that this can vary for
particular clauses in a discourse. The Potential mood is
used in 7-20 to indicate the speaker's belief, clear from
discourse context and the real-world situation, that the
addressee has not yet gone away, and that this is still a
potential fact only. In 7-21, the speaker is exhorting the
addressee to throw the spear steadily and the verb is marked
for Potential mood because the act of throwing steadily has
not actually occurred, and is also still only a potential
fact.   However, following the command to be careful, the
next statement, that the spear will break, is marked with
the Indicative imperfective in spite of the fact that it is
not an objectively real fact: the spear has not yet broken.
The switch of mood here indicates that, as far as the speak-
er is concerned, the spear is certain to break if it is not
thrown steadily, and the utterance is coded in the indicat-
ive to reflect this.","[196, 197]"
"It is also probably true that all the speakers of Wagiman in
Pine Creek had alcohol problems at the time of the research,
making them often difficult to find, or to rely on to work
at any previously arranged time. On returning to Pine Creek
in 1984, a period of more than two months passed without any
significant language material having been recorded, and it
became clear that other speakers would have to be found.
Following what could be considered the exhaustion of the
linguistic resources there that year, I was able to continue    It is common in Australian Aboriginal culture for the
names of deceased people to be proscribed for a certain
period, during which time close relatives and, to a lesser
extent, other people do not utter the name or any word which
sounds like it.    Wagiman people do not currently seem to
have any strong restrictions on repeating the names of rec-
ently deceased people, although there is occasionally some
hesitation for Mundeng. On this basis I will provide names
of deceased Wagiman people in the text where relevant. How-
ever, readers should take note that tact and care must be
used if referring to these people in front of their relat-
ives and frienos, or in publications or written material of
the research with Douglas Jack Milguyarri and Lulu ldartin
Dalpalngali, who were quite felicitously interested and
willing to teach the language.","[25, 26]"
"The class of participles includes items whose meanings would
place them in other classes in some other languages. The
open participle class tends to compensate for the closed
verb and adverb classes by having members which express
functionally verb-like and adverb-like meanings. Many words
whose meanings could potentially be coded as predicative
nominals actually occur as participles. This situation j\-4\-0
makes identifying an appriate name for the class more diffi-

cult than for others because of the wide range of notional
and semantic functions covered, and the range of syntactic
possibilities expressed. Although these items are not de-
verbal or otherwise derived forms, the name 'participle' is
used here because of the nominal and predicate functions
which these words have, in much the same way as the 'parti-
ciple' forms of English and other European languages' verbs
can have both.predicate and argument features.44.4        AdverbsAdverbs form an apparently closed class, the members of
which are unsuffixed and occur in clauses containing at
least a verb.      Sub-classes of mood, manner, position and
time can be identified. The mood adverbs are dyamba 'can-
ndt , do not ' , r u d y i ' N E G A T I V E ' , menuny 'perhaps' , g o r r o
' tried but failed ' and manya ' can, must '        .    Many of the man-
ner, time and position adverbs have meanings which allow
them to occur in more than one sub-classification, suggest-
ing that only one other sub-class including them all can be
justified. However, approximate groups are: dyumbany
'last, afterwards, behind' and yoggona ' first , before, in
front' (both manner and position function), dyapan 'slowly',
g a h a 'fast' (manner function only); position adverbs wolok
'on top', wrnrya 'underneath', d a b a l i 'beside, around', dubay
'low down, downstream', gaqga 'high up, uphill'; and time
adverbs goko 'still, again' and ylmbama 'all the time' (as
well as gorro 'later').","[110, 111]"
"6.2.2    ABSOLUTIVE case -9The Absolutive case has zero morphological realization, and
Absolutive nominals are thus formally identical with umarked
nominals in other case relations (for example, unmarked
Ergative case nominals).     It is not intended that 'zero
realization' mean that the Absolutive case is expressed by a
'zero marker', but rather that it is indicated by the abs-
ence of any other marking.    Zero marked nominals are also
given by speakers as citation forms.     The Absolutive case
is required for the subject of intransitive clauses (S func-
tion), the object of transitive clauses ( 0 function) and for
nominals in verbless eqational clauses (cf. 11.3).",[148]

"However, the term 'auxiliary construction' in the literature
actually covers a wide variety of constructions in which the
only common feature is that some item other than the 'main
verb' is used to carry information concerning tense. This
seems to be from Dixon (1972:15) who states that:      'There are languages in which information regarding
      tense is shown, not by inflection of a verb but by
      an additional 'auxiliary' element in the utter-
      ance. 'A wide variety of disparate constructions are thus somewhat
misleadingly grouped under the same heading, and include
those where the auxiliary can be considered to be, or to
2
    Brief descriptions of such constructions in a number of
Australian languages are to be found in Dixon (1976:613-
768).   Almost all of them are presented in terms of 'aux-
iliary' plus 'particle', or a terminological variant.
    have been historically, some sort of finite verb; other
    types included are also those languages in which the 'aux'
    is an invariable, lexically empty item, used only to carry
    information regarding tense or aspect for the clause, as in
t   Warlpiri (Hale 1973). A feature of the latter type of 'aux'
    element is that it cannot occur as a finite verb by itself,
    whereas in Wagiman this is quite common. The term 'finite
    verb' is thus preferred over 'auxiliary' here because of the
    potential confusion of terminology.","[258, 259]"
"     Examples of alternations between forms with and without
     -yalan have been recorded, but only for guka 'sleep' and
     gukaya'an 'camp out' can any consistent difference in mean-
     ing be discerned.   For other forms, examples are so rare
     that a meaning difference may have been lost in the speak-
     ers' translations. -ya8an form alternants of such parti-
     ciples have been recorded on only one or two occasions, and        Wagiman luya'an is probably comprised of an original root
     In- plus the verb ya'an, and can be compared with the 'proto
     Australian' root lu- 'to cry, sob, weep' proposed by Dixon
     (1980:404).  A verb root la- 'to cry' is still found in some
     of the more northerly Pama-Nyungan languages, for example,

attempts to elicit further examples later were not success-
ful, for what appeared to be contextual reasons. At some
stage the addition of -yaman might have been a productive
process for the creation of participles from some other word
class, or for the creation of causative forms from other
participles, but this is not attested. It should be recall-
ed that ya'an as a finite verb means ' to tell' or ' to do' ,
with a causative implication. gukaya'an 'camp out' can be
thus considered a derived causative form of guka 'sleep', in
which the addition of -ya8an expresses the causativity.","[255, 256]"

   There is no lexical distinction between 'fire' and 'fire-
wood'; either translation would serve as well here.
Chapter 10    Adverbs, interjections and interrogationAdverbs and interjections form closed classes which contain
a small number of members only. Adverbs have mood, spatial
position and temporal marking functions, and can modify noun
phrases, verbs or whole clauses. Some of the 16 recorded
adverbs have more than one meaning, or two or more closely
connected meanings. For example, dyumbany can have the
spatial meaning 'behind' or the temporal meaning 'after-
wards, last', while gorro can mean either 'tried but failed'
or 'later'.","[286, 287]"
"When -ra occurs on nominals, it serves to focus the marked
nominal relative to other items in the clause. In 11-66 -pa
on the Oblique object pronoun nug also has an anaphoric
effect, linking its referent with previous 3sg pronominal
references (see text DLB 1;4-6). The following occurrences
of -ra on verbs are in different clauses, but in 11-67 a
focussed nominal and verb occur simultaneously in the same
clause:11-66   ga-ya '      nq-ra         dyamba         qa-yu-ra ,

nominal of an NP to focus the referent in a manner similar
to the Specific referent suffix -dim The difference is not
so much one of marking a specific referent, in contrast to
some other referent (see 6.3.4), but that the referent is
being focussed on its own:11-68   ma'an-aa     bugali   magu     9-ni-gin                a        this-FOC     cousin   there    3sg:PFV-lie-PAST

yes indeed' (as in ilkawu-ra), it emphasises the positive
agreement of the word.  It is thus motivated primarily by
discourse requirements.","[355, 356]"
"    The bulk of the corpus used for the description is that
    prov(.ded by Lulu Martin Dalpalngali and Douglas Jack Milgu-
    yarsi, mainly without translation prompts. The method used
    here was to present the speaker with a topic word or sent-
    ence example, either in English or Wagiman, and to record
    the ensuing discourse. This provided many good examples of
    contextualized utterances and short texts of several clauses
    in length. Neither of these two speakers tended to trans-
    late word for word, SO that the material gathered in this
    manner is more reliable than that extracted from speakers
1
    through translation prompts. One drawback, however, is that
    it usually contains references to a small number of grammat-
    ical persons, because most sessions were with one speaker
    only. Speakers generally also had a habit of perceiving a
    discourse link between unconnected topic prompts, so that
    many consecutively elicited utterances would be about the
    same discourse topic, and would contain similarly-limited
    numbers of verbs and participant references, despite att-
    empts to extract other information.",[28]

corresponds to the ambient structural use of participles.
However, two forms, werr'ma and lema have been recorded
whose function appears to be one of orienting the action in
space and direction. The specific function and meaning of
these two words is highly dependent on the finite verb with
which they occur, but typically they describe the direct-
ional orientation of the action. Generally, rerr'ma means
'(action) (occur) outside', but can also be used to state
that the direction of the action or state was 'outwards' in
relation to something else. lema is similar, and means
'(action) (occur) inside', or '(action) inwards'. Both can
thus be used in predicate adjective function with a copula
verb to mean 'be inside' and 'be outside'.","[271, 272]"

"    In virtually all elicited examples where the speaker was
    asked for translations of English dual number, a Pair-marked
    free pronoun occurs with a similarly marked finite verb, in
    what seem to be sentences which unduly emphasise the dual
number marking in Wagiman. This merely represents, in fact,
speakers' attempts to translate what they saw as an arti-
ficially emphasised feature of the English source sentences.
The problem with such examples is that they are produced
completely out of context, and could only be produced natur-
ally in a quite different setting.","[176, 177]"
"Ergative case marking can also occur on the nominal agent of
the verb ya'an ' to say1, 'to tell' to distinguish the two
different meanings. When it is used to mean 'to tell' and
occurs with an overt object such as 'story', Ergative case
marking can occur on the agent; when it means 'to say' and
is followed by reported speech, Ergative marking does not
occur, In both constructions, the addressee is usually
expressed by an Oblique pronoun or an unmarked free nominal.
Examples 6-6 and 6-7 can be compared for this feature (the
root form of yapan is yam-):6-6     qigun-yi    gi-yam-pi               UanW       gaman

        '(Then) another white man came up and said to go
        away. tThe occurrence of Ergative case marking can thus be related
generally to the presence of a patient, either perceived or
    overt, in the clause. It can be seen, however, that transi-
    tivity of participles also affects the presence of Ergative
    case marking, so that morphological ergativity is not neces-
    sarily triggered only by the transitivity of the finite
    verb. Rather than being the grammatical reflex of the sub-
    categorization of verbs into classes of 'transitive' and
    'intransitive', Ergative case marking actually reflects the
    'transitivity' value of any transitive item in the clause.","[146, 147]"
"        While there is only a small number of actual speakern, a
        larger number of individuals identify themselves as being
        'Wagiman' people. The name 'Wagiman', however, is primarily
        a language name, and individuals identify with the language,
        not on the basis of their use of it, but on the basis of
        their ownership of it. Thus the term 'language owning
        group' is used to define those individuals who identify
I
        themselves with the language name, irrespective of whether
        they actually speak the language (Chase and Meehan 1983:
        8-9).   The terms 'Wagiman people' and 'Wagiman language
        owning group' are used interchangeably here, but contrast
        with 'Wagiman speakers'. Like speakers, members of the
        language owning group are still relatively few in number:
        there are perhaps 40 individuals who would claim identifi-
        cation with the group, and many are young children or young
        adults. Most live in Pine Creek, while some non-speakers,
        other than Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, live in Darwin. Many
        members of the language owning group belong to the extended
        Huddleston family of Pine Creek, of which there are current-
0.3     Language teachers ('informants*)Several Wagiman people provided material for this descript-
ion. Early data was given by Don Liddy Balambal, Paddy
Huddleston Benbo and his father George Huddleston Yalkpa-
yarri, mainly in the form of simple sentences and lexical
items. They also provided many of the later research leads
through examples of the basic morphology as well.      Paddy
Huddleston Benbo is a relatively young speaker of the lang-
uage (perhaps no older than 50), and was often not sure of
some words or constructions. He referred these cases to his
mother, Dolly Huddleston Wudyinma, for help; through pers-
onal observation, Wudyinma seems to be the best speaker of
Wagiman alive today, although she was never interested in
teaching the language. She was quite content, however, to
be the arbiter of any disputes or problems which arose in
the course of the work, and all considered her to be the
expert on the language and culture. The narrative text she
provided (Text DHW 1 in Appendix 1) was an exception to her
normal reticence; on the other hand, her husband Yalkpayarri
was an enthusiastic and interested participant, although his
lack of teeth, poor English and some interference from other
languages in the area made data from him difficult to under-
stand, and often unreliable. Both Yalkpayarri and Wudyinma
are old, perhaps in their mid-seventies , while Yalkpayarri
is almost blind and often incapacitated by illness.","[23, 24]"

Clearly, a major problem in determining any order is that
usually either A or 0 only, but not both, occurred in trans-
itive clauses as a free nominal, and in clauses that take an
oblique complement often the Oblique only occurred. In the
texts the overwhelming choice for the single overt free
nominal was 0 (43 transitive examples, plus 41 other examp-
les of the verb ya'an 'to say, tell' followed by an Oblique
pronoun), while A occurred overtly only in 4 sentences. In
intransitive clauses, an overt S occurred on 33 occasions:Figux-e 11-5   Single NP clauses               NP as Obl      41
Such a pattern is indicative of two discourse processes in
action. The first is that in narrative discourse, once a
topic is established it is usually referred to only by pro-
nominal reference in the prefix, and' no further overt nom-
inal reference is made to it. Furthermore, the grammatical
role of the topic is not important in such reference because
the general ordering principle of 'topic-to-the-left' (Mall-
inson and Blake 1981.:151) does not affect the position of
the prefix, allowing any grammatical role to be topic with-
out creating ordering conflict. In this way, the topic
marked in the prefix without any nominal referent is 'old'
or previously given information. The second process is one
where new information is introduced by an overt nominal and
occurs earlier in the clause than other material, thus foll-
owing a principle of 'new-before-old'.","[313, 314, 315]"
"Several different sources can be proposed for modern partic-
iples within this approach:       (i)     Some participles were probably originally
monomorphemic finite verbs.   These would seem to have been
the participles in classes (iiia) and (iiib) in Figure 9-1
which are polysyllabic and end with a voiceless stop and the
vowel a .     Some of these participles can still occur as
finite verbs under particular circumstances (duduta(-yi) 'to
run' and guka(-yi) 'to sleep', for example). Others cannot,
although the synchronic triggers for the variation are not
known.      (ii)    Some participles may originally have been
adverbials or even other monomorphemic finite verbs comp-
ounded with another finite verb to form a polymorphemic verb
stem. The participles in classes (i) and (ii) in Figure 9-1
which are followed by a glottal stop and contain a final
syllable form of -ma, -na, or -ga are candidates here.
Significantly, -ma is homophonous with the finite verb ma-yi
'to get', a likely root for transitive compounding. In
Mangarayi, the form -ma currently occurs in compound cons-
tructions as an 'auxiliary' with other roots unable to occur
alone, and also as a main verb where it occurs with free
'particles' (Merlan 1982:129-30).    -na is also homophonous
with the Wagiman verb root na-ni 'to become', also a likely
inchoative compounding root.     Modern Wagiman participles
followed by -ga could be the result of either the compound-
ing of another verb which has no modern form, or the result
of phonological changes over time, due perhaps to the pre-
ceding vowel or word-initial consonants. Only gaP1ma from
this group has been recorded as a finite verb.     (iii)    The participles in class (iv) which end in a
form homophonous with the finite verb yalan 'to say, to do'-
could also be the result of compounding with that verb, in
order to create a finite, perhaps causative, verb form (cf.
section 9.6). Some items in this class can also function as
modern finite verbs without -pavan, such as belka-yi 'to
roast, to cook'. Some others are also the result of syn-
chronically transparent compounding (cf. guka 'sleep' and
gukayalan 'camp out').","[338, 339]"
