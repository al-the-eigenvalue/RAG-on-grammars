"838chapter seventeenWhen an adverbial interrogative expression meaning ‘why’ is placed at
the front of a copula clause, the copula is, likewise, attached to this item
rather than to the predicate, e.g.
(14) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is this town like this?’ (A4:31)
17.1.5. Existential Usage
In a few cases the enclitic copula is used simply to predicate the existence
of a referent rather than ascribe some property to it or identify it with
another item. This is most commonly found in meteorological expressions, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)xapù°5la.} ‘It is foggy (literally: There is fog).’
mê†r5la.} ‘It is rainy (literally: There is rain).’
xêmm5le ""èlli.} ‘I am hot (literally: There is heat is to me).’
qàr°5la ""èlli.} ‘I am cold (literally: There is cold is to me).’Other examples:
(5)
(6)
(7)gu-xa-gèppa hambišàye-wawa.} ‘There were giants in a cave.’ (A12:18)
há ríx6t náša naxrày5le!} ‘Ha, there is the smell of a foreign man!’
(A24:47)
""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} ‘While there was flour on her hands,
she opened the door.’ (A21:26)In principle the nuclear stress is placed on the existential subject in such
constructions, which reflects its status as a new information focus. In (8)
the copula is placed on a preceding quantifier. In such constructions the
whole clause is a new information focus, including the existential subjects,
which is reflected by the position of the nuclear stress on the subject at
the end of the intonation group. The placement of the copula on the
quantifier, therefore, does not express a narrow new information focus on
the quantifier, but rather expresses a prominence or intensification of the
quantifier within the broad information focus of the clause:
(8)""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""á°‰a.} ráb5wa tàlga} ráb5wa mè†ra ""u-m6ndiyàne.}
‘(The month of ) February was very bad in our country. There was
a lot of snow. There was a lot of rain and so on.’ (B5:152)the clause839Sporadically the enclitic copula is found with an existential function with
referentially definite subjects in other contexts, e.g.
(9)har-W7rda-w Nˆrgis-ila.} làtla,} lá bnòne,} lá ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Only W5rda
and N5rgis were there. They had no children, nothing.’ (A24:51)The independent copula is attested with existential meaning in clauses
contaning indefinite subjects, e.g.
(10) gu-d-ó qotíya ""íla xa-ßêpra.} ‘In that box there is a sparrow.’ (A12:40)
The deictic copula is used existentially with definite or indefinite subject
constituents. It is placed either before or after the subject, e.g.
(11) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
(12) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)
(13) xa-b7°a hòle.} ‘There is a house over there.’ (A33:5)
17.2. Clauses Containing a Negative Copula
The negative copula is in principle placed before the predicate. The most
basic construction consists of a simple nexus of copula and predicate, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)l7le dàwa.} ‘It is not gold.’ (A14:26)
l7le póìla.} ‘It is not crooked.’ (A17:20)
l7le gnàyi.} ‘Its not my fault.’ (A23:23)
l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this country.’ (A25:82)
l7wa rába gò‰a.} ‘It was not very big.’ (B5:140)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally placed
before the predicate, e.g.
(6) ""áwwa lˆle qáša.} ‘He is not a priest.’ (B17:7)
(7) ""áw l7le ""ùpri.} ‘It is not my land.’ (A25:52)
(8) Yuwán6s lˆle táma.} ‘Yuwan6s is not there.’ (A52:6)
(9) dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
(10) yèmmi l7wa qrì°a.} ‘My mother was not educated.’ (B8:15)840chapter seventeenThe nuclear stress is placed either at the end of the predicate phrase or on
the copula. It is typically placed on the copula when the predicate consists
of an item that has been introduced in the preceding discourse, e.g.
(11) mère má-l6x bráta t-it-hátxa bxàya} qam-d-ánna ""êrwe?} mèra ""ánna lˆwa
""èrwe,} xon>wà°i w7wa.} ‘He said “What is the matter with you girl
that you are weeping so much in front of these sheep?” She said
“These used not to be sheep, they used to be my brothers.” ’
(A34:20–21)
(12) mère mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} . . . mèra ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He
said “What dog have you given birth to?” . . . She said “He is not
a dog. You are a dog.” ’ (A11:20)
(13) ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ""áwwa mì°5le.} ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,}
""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.} ‘They say that he has
no relatives. He is dead (in this case). So long as he had a wife,
he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’ (A17:17)
The subject constituent is sporadically placed after the predicate. As with
positive copula clauses with postposed subjects, this construction is used
to express close cohesion to what precedes. It is found in contexts such
as (14), in which the clause is a comment that is presented as a tag to the
preceding remark and not the onset of a new discourse section. Note that
the subject is in a separate intonation group:
(14) hot-q†ìl6lle ""a≥vána!} mêre} lˆle ""a≥vána} ""àwwa.} (She said) “You have killed
the caretaker.” ’. He said “He is not the caretaker.” ’ (A22:46)
The negative copula is placed after the predicate in idiomatic interrogative
constructions such as (15) and (16). In these an interrogative clause with
a negative copula echoes a preceding interogative clause with a positive
copula, maintaining the same word order:
(15) dréla šláma l-f9qih} dàx-it?} dax-lˆw6t?} ‘She greeted the jurist “How
are you? How are you not?” (A22:16)
(16) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla.} ‘If he is my
nephew, he will come and will know what these are and what they
are not.’ (A25:49)the clause841This echoing of the word order of a preceding constituent question with
a positive copula is also found in the answer to such questions, as in (17),
in which the negative copula in the answer is placed after the predicate:
(17) ""àm6r,} Fárxo †la-xále díye ""àm6r} xáli mòdila?} xáz6x ""askaràye.} kúlla ""Amedía
píšla ""askaràye.} mère xá-m6ndi lˆla.} ‘He said, Farxo said to his maternal
uncle “What is the matter uncle? We can see soldiers. The whole of
Amedia has become soldiers.” He said “It is nothing.” ’ (A25:79)
The 3fs. form of the negative copula l5la is tagged onto the end of clauses
in various contexts to refer to some general propositional content, e.g.
(18) b8z6xwa tannêkka.} tannèkka t-nù†a l7la?} ‘We would make a hole in
the can, an oil can, is that not so?’ (B10:86)
(19) kèma gàye} gu-xáßa díya mútte tópe ‘Æruk,} lˆla.} ‘Several times the guns
were pointed at her back, bang, but it does not happen (i.e. the
gun does not shoot).’ (B9:18)
The negative particle la is occasionally used in a clause containing a positive copula in order to express asseveration rather than negation. In such
cases the negative particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.
(20) la-hóle mì°a.} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
(21) la-""aw-d°s-wewa.} ‘He was indeed right.’ (A17:8)
(22) la-málka màmi} hóle yèmya b-rèši.} ‘Indeed the king my uncle has sworn
on my head (to execute me).’ (A25:36)
(23) la-""àxxa-wewa.} ‘He was indeed here.’
Such constructions have no doubt developed from the use of the negator
as an interjection to contradict some statement or request of the interlocutor, as is seen in contexts such as (24):
(24) mère ßli-qàm°a} mère la-""àti ßli-qám°a.} ‘He said “Go down and
meet her.” He (the other) said “No, you go down to meet her.” ’
(A26:40)842chapter seventeen
17.3. The Existential ParticlesThe existential particles (""i°, ""i°wa, li°, li°wa and their variants) are placed
either before or after the nominal with which they are combined.
17.3.1. Particle—Nominal
In most constructions with the positive existential particle that are attested
in the text corpus the nominal is placed after the particle. The function
of such constructions is to introduce into the discourse new referents,
which have not been mentioned previously. The nominal in most cases is
indefinite with a specific referent, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)""í°6n xa-†ùra.} ‘There is a mountain.’ (A24:11)
""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘There was a king.’ (A1:2)
""í° xa-párša b-réše dìye.} ‘There is a flat stone on him.’ (A39:13)
""í°6n táma ðà""a.} ‘There is a woman there.’ (A25:53)In some cases the nominal denotes a generic class or is a proper name.
Both of these types of nominal are definite in status, since their referent is identifiable from their description independently of context. The
crucial feature, however, is not identifiability but rather the fact that they
have not been mentioned previously and are being introduced into the
discourse, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)""í°wa ""9raq.} ‘There was arak.’ (B5:11)
""7-ga qam-lámpa ""í°wa šrà""a.} ‘At that time instead of an (electric)
lamp there was an (oil) lamp.’ (A33:1)
""7-ga ""í°6n ’ixàlo} ""u-""Ašeba†àlo.} ‘At that time there were ’ixalo and
Ašeba†alo.’ (A25:23)When the particle is negative, the nominal is placed after the particle on
several occasions, e.g.
(8) lí° ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There is nothing.’ (A21:5)
(9) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Is there nobody in the house?’ (A22:32)
(10) lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} ‘There are no steps for them to go down
into the basement stable.’ (A22:10)
(11) lí°wa ""ánna q>n9fe-u m6ndiyáne.} ‘There were no armchairs and things
(like that).’ (B5:200)the clause843The nuclear stress is normally placed on the phrase that follows the particle.
It is placed on the particle to express a narrow focus in contexts where the
speaker asserts the existence of something when it may be presupposed
that it does not exist, e.g.
(12) mabyóne ""ì°-xa-m6ndi gu-qèßß6t.} ‘It seems there really is something in
the story.’ (A4:18)
17.3.2. Nominal—Particle
Constructions with the positive existential particle that have the nominal
before the particle are only sporadically attested. They are used when the
nominal is modified by an interrogative particle, e.g.
(1)k6mà 'Abda-Ra˙màn ""í°?} ‘How many 'Abda-Ra˙màns are there?’
(A23:27)The nominal is placed before the particle in contexts where the referent
of the nominal has already been introduced in the immediately preceding context, e.g.
(2)†alítuwa †awalyà°a?} †awalyá°a ""í°wa ràba} ""àx‘i} lá-raba ""i-taxrênna.}
‘ “Did you play games?” “There were many games, but I do not
remember them much.” ’ (B15:30)The preposed nominal may not have been explicitly mentioned, but is
nevertheless bound to previously mentioned items in a set relation. This
is the case in (3), in which the universal set term ‘everything’ includes the
items ‘fine grapes’ and ‘houris’:
(3)""i°-táma ""ènwa †èpi} ""u-˙uriy?t} ""u-kúlla-m6ndi ""ì°gena} ‘There are there
fine grapes and houris. There is everything.’ (A2:8)Constructions with the negative existential particle that have the nominal
before the particle are frequently attested in the text corpus. On some
occasions the referent of the nominal has been mentioned in the preceding
discourse. The construction in such cases does not deny the existence of
the referent but rather denies its presence on the scene, e.g.
(4)""áza xázya jùlla,} júlla lì°.} ‘She goes to find her clothes, but her
clothes are not there.’ (A14:99)844
(5)
(6)
(7)chapter seventeen
""o-xóna zóra lì°.} ‘The young brother is not there.’ (A12:24)
Parizáda ‰ìšla,} †7ra lì°.} ‘Parizada woke up, but the bird is not there.’
(A24:30)
‰íšela ""ánna maymùne,} ""ína ""áni lì°.} ‘The monkeys woke up, but they
(the men) were not there.’ (A14:57)In some cases the referent of the nominal is linked to what precedes by
associative anaphora, such as a set relationship, e.g.
(8)xílle xá‘ca m6n-d-o-dùša.} ßéle mìya,} xa-†6ppí°a míya lì°.} ‘He ate some
of the honey. He became thirsty for water, but there was not a
drop of water.’ (A14:24)In many cases, however, the preposed nominal has no clear anaphoric
relationship with what precedes. The placement of the nominal in such
cases is likely to be conditioned by its lack of referentiality. It would appear
that referential nominals that introduce a referent into the discourse
have a greater tendency to be placed after the nominal than negated,
non-referential ones. In the attested examples the nuclear stress is placed
either on the particle (9–11) or on the nominal (12–13). The placement
of the nuclear stress on the nominal takes place where the negation of
the nominal is reinforced by the negative particle ‘u- or, in the case of
the indefinite pronoun xa, the particle ""ap. The nucelar stress gives added
force to these particles. These negative reinforcement particles may also
be used where the nuclear stress is on the existential particle (10–11):
(9)qímela xìlela.} qímela šqílela xa-""amána xàn‘i zóra.} mútt6lla k6s-réša dìya.}
ßáw°a lì°6n.} ‘They ate. Then they took a small container and put
it at her head. There was no speech (with this).’ (A21:17–18)
(10) xzéle xa-qáßra ràba gó‰a.} zíl5le mèxya t9ra.} ‘ú-naša lì°.} ‘He saw a
very large palace. He went and knocked on the door. There was
nobody.’ (A14:28)
(11) q6m-šaqlàla kanóšta,} daryála gu-nùra.} ‘ú-m6ndi lì°.} ‘She took the broom
and put it in the fire, but there was nothing (= nothing happened).’
(A12:39)
(12) ‘ù-qala lí°.} ‘There is no sound.’ (A18:15)
(13) ""àp-xa lí°.} ‘There is nobody.’ (A33:3)
When two or more negated existential clauses are conjoined, the negative
particle la may be placed before each nominal. In such constructions thethe clause845nominals are presented as being linked in a set relationship. The existential
particle may have either its positive or negative form, e.g.
(14) la-bˆ°a ""í°6n,} ""u-la-nàša ""í°6n.} ‘There is not a house and there is
nobody there.’ (A39:2)
(15) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There is no ass with him, (there
is) nothing.’ (A22:25)
The negative particle la can be used before the positive existential particle
with an asseverative function, e.g.
(16) la-""í°wa manày.} ‘Indeed there was a meaning (to this).’ (B8:33)
17.3.3. Particle Alone
In certain contexts the negative particle is used by itself, without any other
clause constituents.
It may refer anaphorically to a referent in the previous discourse denoting the absence of this referent from the scene, e.g.
(1)Óásan ""Á©a spár5le ta-t-dˆ‰a} ""u-spár5le ta-t-dˆ‰a,} lì°.} ‘Óasan A©a waits
for her to return, waits for her to return, but she is not there.’
(A27:26)Speakers sometimes use the particle as an interrogative tag to receive confirmation from the interlocutor. This is generally used in contexts where
the speaker is sure about what he is saying, but seeks confirmation as a
device for drawing attention to a particular point. The sense can often
be rendered in English by ‘you see’:
(2) ""o-šúla ""áwwa y-amrèxwale qêr†a lí°6n?} ‘We called this job trimming,
you see.’ (B5:141)
(3) mágl6t gilándi xá-mdi gò‰5le lí°6n?} ‘The scythe is something big, you
see.’ (B5:144)
(4) ""ítwa náše šuléy ""àww5le lí°6n?} ‘There were people whose job was this,
you see.’ (B5:135)
(5) ""í°wale qèšta-w géra d-ˆ-ga,} lì°?} ‘He had a bow and arrow (typical)
of that time, you see.’ (A12:32)
In narrative it is occasionally used as a device to draw attention to an
unexpected event, e.g.","[876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884]"
"‘Do not go out!’The particle la may be combined with the pre-verbal particles ""i- (§8.6.1.)
and q6m- (§8.6.3.). When the particle ""i- occurs before a verb beginning
with a consonant, the /i/ vowel is syllabified with the /a/ of the preceding negator. In most cases the sequence /lay/ shifts to /ley/ or contracts
to l5, in accordance with the usual phonetic process that is undergone by
the diphthong /ay/, e.g.
le-y-pal6†
l5-pal6†
Examples from the text corpus:
(1) ""an-náše le-y-mbáqri m6n-""árxa ""áti m-ˆk5w6t} ‘Those people do not ask
from a guest “Where are you from?” ’ (A29:45)
(2) bás le-y-mabyênwa} ‘but it did not show’ (B10:57)
(3) le-y-máxi pr•zla l-""áql6t dawˆre?} ‘Don’t people put metal on the feet
of mules?’ (B4:12)verbs195(4) l5-xàru} ‘It does not go off ’ (B5:119)
(5) míya l7-ßale bíye dìye} ‘Water does not flow down into it’ (B5:192)
(6) l7-q5mi ràba} ‘They do not grow much’ (B5:215)
Note (7) in which the negator bears its own stress and the /y/ is separated
from the verb:
(7) lè-y ""amr•tli qá-mo °él6x?} ‘Won’t you tell me why you have come?’
(A8:77)
Since the vowel /5/ has a tendency to be lowered to /a/, especially in
unstressed syllables (§2.3.4.), the form l5-pál6† is sometimes pronounced
la-pál6†, in which all trace of the indicative particle has been lost.
When the particle ""i- has the form of y- at the onset of the first syllable
of verbs of initial /""/ roots, the /y/ generally remains when the negator
is prefixed. The /a/ sometimes remains unchanged, but usually is raised
to the region of /5/ or /e/, e.g.
la-y-áx6l
l5-y-áx6l
le-y-áx6l‘He does not eat’The initial / ""/ of the verb is sometimes retained, e.g.
la-y-""áx6l
l5-y-""áx6l
le-y-""áx6l
Examples from the text corpus:
(8) là-y-awra} ‘She will not enter’ (B8:35)
(9) là-y-asq6n} ‘I shall not go up’ (A32:29)
(10) ""•rwe l7-y-asqi †úra xàla} ‘The sheep do not go up into the mountains
to eat’ (B5:108)
(11) l7-y-ax6l xêtna} ‘The groom will not eat’ (B5:32)
(12) le-y-áxl6x b-‘àng6l} ‘We do not eat with a fork’ (B10:96)
(13) le-y-""amrènne †làlux} ‘I shall not tell you’ (A24:45)
Examples of the negator used before the particle q6m-:196chapter eight(14) là q6m-qa†èlla ""aqèrwa} ‘He did not kill the scorpion’ (A9:5)
(15) lá q6m-xazìle} ‘They did not see him’ (B9:6)
(16) lá q6m-basmále ""ayyà ‘This did not please him’ (A8:5)
The particle b6d- together with its various phonetic variants (§8.6.2.), one
of several functions of which is to express a future action, is not combined
with the negator la. In the negation of constructions with b6d-, the latter
is omitted and the negator is placed before the verb:
b6d-pál6†‘He will leave’¤la-pál6†‘He will not leave’On some occasions a negated future form has the particle ""i-, e.g.
t-áxléna‘I shall eat’¤l5-y-axléna‘I shall not eat’8.10. Negative Copula
8.10.1. Negative Present Copula
The present copula is negated by prefixing to it the particle la. The combination of the /a/ of the negator with the /i/ of the copula coalesces
to /5/. The 1st and 2nd person forms exist in two alternants, a longer
one formed by the combination of the negator and the copula with a
iw- base (""iw6n, ""iw6t etc.) and a shorter one formed from the abbreviated
copula without /w/ (""in, ""it etc.):

lowered to the region of /a/: lat (2s), lan (1s.), lax (1pl.). In the speech
of some informants the /l/ between the two vowels of the 3rd person
negative copula is occasionally weakened and the vowels coalesce. This is
not represented in the transcription: l7le [l5[], l7la [l5[], l7l5 [l5[]. In fast
speech the quality of the vowel may be lowered to [a], resulting in a form
that is homophonous with the simple negative particle la.
Unlike the positive copula, the negative copula is regularly placed before
the predicate, e.g. l7le gu-má°a ‘He is not in the village’, l7w6n x•ðya ‘I am
not happy’, lat-xáwri ‘You are not my friend’.
8.10.2. Negative Past Copula
The negative past copula is formed by combining la with the past copula
series ""íwa, ""iwéwa and wéwa. When combined with the first two series with
initial ""i-, this vowel contracts with the /a/ vowel of la to /5/: l7wa < la +
""iwa, l7wewa < la + ""iwewa. The stress normally falls on the initial syllable.
Full paradigms of these two negated series are as follows:

8.11. Negation of Compound Verbal Forms
Compound verb forms consisting of a combination of the copula with a
resultative participle or an infinitive are negated by replacing the positive
copula with the negative copula. The negative copula is regularly placed
before the participle or infinitive:

"the clause
(5)893""o-déwa l7le lá plìxa} ""u-lá zêrya} ""u-lá xzìda.} ‘That wolf has neither
worked, nor cultivated, nor harvested.’ (A10:3)We see from (5) that the items are not necessarily placed at the front of
the clause but may remain in their normal position.
The verb may be gapped after the first clause of the coordinated series,
e.g.
(6)

(8)""ána lànwa wíða} là x6rbayú°a} là spayú°a †la-‘ú-naša.} ‘I have not done

of construction, e.g.
(9)šuréle mtaxmòne.} gu-d-áy taxmànta} †¬á yomàne} l7le la-xíla-w la-šêtya} ""ula-dmìxa.} ‘He began to think. He was (immersed) in this musing
for three days without eating or drinking or sleeping.’ (A26:19)In (10) the Arabic particle walla ‘and not’ is used by the speaker in this
type of construction:
(10) le-šóq6n lá xolamwà°a} wálla ""àti} wálla yêmmi} wálla ‘u-nàša.} ‘I shall not
let servants, you, mother or anybody (look after them).’ (A8:18)
Similar constructions are attested with existential particles, in which the
negator is either repeated (11) or is placed only before the item in focus
(12):
(11) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There was not an ass with him,
nor anything (else).’ (A22:25)
(12) la-bàba ""ítle,} la-yêmma ""ítle.} ‘He does not have a father and he does
not have a mother.’ (A14:16)
The unusual construction in (13) with the sequence la ""itle rather than
litle may perhaps be understood in this light. The noun nx6p°a ‘shame’ is
established in a set relationship with what precedes in order to explain
the meaning of the latter:894chapter seventeen(13) xzí hátxa be-nxêp°5le.} lá ""ítle nxêp°a} ‘Look, he is so shameless. He
has no shame.’ (A6:11)
In certain circumstances a negative particle is placed before an infinitive
that is the complement of a main verb if only the infinitive is in the scope
of the negation, e.g.
(14) ""u-kút-xa mšuréle là-dwaqa míya.} ‘Everybody began (to agree) not to
gather water.’ (A24:43)
(iii) Asseveration
The negative particle may be used to express asseveration rather than
negation, especially to dispell possible doubt after questions. In such cases
the particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.
(1)A: štélux ‘àyux?} B: la-štèli!} ‘A: “Have you drunk your tea?” B:
“Indeed I have drunk it!” ’If the clause contains a compound verbal form with a copula, the copula
is not replaced by the negative copula, e.g.
(2)A: t-à°eti?} B: la-hóli °àya!} ‘A: “Will you come?” B: “But I am
coming!” ’The negative particle is used to express asseveration also before a negated
clause, as seen in (3):
(3)lá l5-z>dènwa ‘u-bèna.} ‘Indeed, I was never afraid.’ (B5:130)17.7.14.3. Negation of the Verb ‘to know’
The present form of the verb to know exhibits some irregularities.
When combined with the negator la, the first syllable of the verb is often
contracted, e.g. l5ð6n < la-y>ð6n ‘I do not know’, l5ð6x < la-y>ð6x ‘We do
not know’. An alternative negative form is formed by replacing the first
syllable of the verb by mi-, e.g. mið6n ‘I do not know’, miðe ‘He does not
know’. This derives historically from a phrase containing the interrogative
particle (< mo y>ð6n ‘What do I know?, mo y>ðe ‘What does he know?’). It
has now, however, lost its interrogative sense and functions as a negator, as
shown by phrases such as míð6n mòdi} (A1:23) ‘I don’t know what’. Further
examples from the text corpus:the clause895(1) míð6n ""o-b7°a ""ˆk5le.} ‘I don’t know where that house is.’ (A12:63)
(2) kút-yum ""á°ya xàj6tta daryáwa bíye díye} ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} róxux ""ˆk5la-w?}
""u-dáx-it xyà""a?} mìð6n mó.} ‘Every day she came with a pretext (to ask
him) “Where is your strength? Where is your spirit? How do you
live?,” I don’t know what (else she asked).’ (A12:38)
(3) míð6t ""áyya módila mßò°e.} ‘You do not know what she is saying.’
(A38:10)
17.8. Extrapositional Constructions
In many cases a referential participant in a clause is extraposed in initial
position in syntactic isolation. This is normally resumed in the body of the
clause by a coreferential pronominal element that indicates its syntactic
function. In what follows we shall first examine the structural details of
this type of construction and then discuss its function. This section will
consider not only clauses with verbal predicates, but also those with a
copula or existential particle.
17.8.1. Structure
17.8.1.1. Extraposed Element
The extraposed element may be a nominal or an independent pronoun,
e.g.
(1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
(2) ""o-Dáwið mòdi šúle díye?} ‘That David—what is his profession?’
(A16:1)
(3) ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘The food—the family of the bride
would make it.’ (B5:7)
(4) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
(5) ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)
(6) ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye Mar-Sàwa.} ‘That—they made its name Saint
Sawa.’ (B6:30)
The extraposed nominal is sometimes uttered in a separate intonation
group, e.g.","[931, 932, 933, 934]"
"the syntax of verbs577(37) d6-mj>mèxl6n jarrèta.} ""áz6x xá-mdita xèta.} ‘Let’s put together a foodbag for ourselves. Let’s go to another town.’ (A30:41)
(38) ""u-""áti d6-ráqð6t š5šátla gàn6x.} ‘You should dance and shake yourself.’
(A27:11)
It may be used in deontic questions such as (39), in which the speaker
addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation or give permission:
(39) de-maxêxle?} ‘Should we beat him?’ (A14:8)
It is placed before the negative particle la in negated deontic expressions,
e.g.
(40) ""áti d6-la-dàmxeti!} ‘Do not sleep!’ (A29:19)
(41) ""ám6r ham-ma-yxàl6f,} 'Abda-Ra˙màn d6-la-""àr6q.} ‘He said “That’s all
right, (only) don’t let 'Abda-Ra˙màn get away.” ’ (A23:30)
(42) ""álaha d6-là-""aw6ð!} ‘God forfend!’ (A27:37)
The particle may be combined with xoš, e.g.
(43) d6-xoš-gàwra.} ‘Let her marry.’ (A26:79)
(iii) šut
As with the other particles, this occurs in both positive and negative
deontic expressions, e.g.
(44) ""6n-maßya šut-""oðala. ‘If she can, let her do it.’ (C1:11)
(45) šút la-""à°e!} ‘Let him not come!’
15.1.1.6. Predictive Future (Irrealis)
The qa†6l is used to predict a future event. In class A verbs that are not
negated this is restricted to predictions that the speaker is not completely
certain about and that he is not guaranteeing will be fulfilled. This can
be designated as a modal future, e.g.
(1)
(2)bálki ""à°ya.} ‘Perhaps she will come.’ (A8:49)
bálki ""á°e xa-yóma ""5-bráta kˆrba mènni.} ‘Perhaps a day will come
when that girl will be angry with me.’ (A14:98)578
(3)
(4)chapter fifteen
""àp-t6mm6l ""áxl6x mènna.} ‘We may (perhaps) eat them also tomorrow.’
(A2:2)
qa-mò ""óð6t ""atxa-šùla?} ‘Why would you do this thing?’ (A8:17)The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start
and end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express
iterative aspect. In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfective, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation, e.g.
(5)bálki ""á°e kùt-yum} ‘Perhaps he will come everyday.’Non-modal future verbs, by which the speaker asserts that something will
take place and is committed to the truth of this assertion, are expressed
by the b6d-qa†6l form with the prefixed future particle (cf. §15.1.5.). When
negated, however, the qa†6l form in group A verbs is used to express both
the modal predictive future, where the action is uncertain (6–7), and also
the non-modal future, which predict events that the speaker is certain will
take place (8–10), e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)bálki lá-""awð6n xàbrux.} ‘Perhaps I shall not do as you say.’ (A21:43)
dàx la-y>ðènne?} ‘How could I not know?’ (A14:90)
""áti xúwwe là ""axèll6x.} ‘The snake will not eat you.’ (A24:39)
málla t-axèlla ""aw-lá-""ax6l ‘ú-mdi sab-rùt5la.} ‘The mullah will eat it
and he will eat nothing because it is Friday.’ (A2:4)
(10) qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)
In class B verbs the qa†6l form is used to express the modal and non-modal
future in both positive and negated clauses, e.g.
(11) qa†lênnux.} ‘I shall kill you.’ (A15:4)
(12) ""àna ma°yánne.} ‘I shall bring her back.’ (A27:30)
(13) bálki qàrm6n.} ‘Perhaps I shall win.’ (A1:4)
(14) brát6t màlka} pál†a l-gàre.} ‘The daughter of the king will come out
onto the roof.’ (A27:11)
(15) ""aw-máy6° ""u-""ùpra páy6š bíyi.} ‘He will die and his land will remain
for me.’ (A26:25)
(16) ""o-Mar-Mùše} x5làn5le,} maxèl5xu.} ‘Saint Muše is strong. He will strike
you.’ (B18:7)the syntax of verbs579When expressing the future, the qa†6l form may have its deictic centre in
the past, as is the case with (17) where it occurs in the context of a past
narrative:
(17) hád6x m-bar-t-gwìrra,} ""aláha q6m-yawèlla xa-bròna.} ""ìma?} ""7-šet6t mˆ°i.}
""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yawèlla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘So, after they married, God
gave them a son. When? The year they would die. The year they
would die, He gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)
15.1.1.7. Conditional Constructions (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in the protasis of conditional sentences referring
to present or future time, e.g.
(1)(2)
(3)
(4)""6n-""ána ""amrènnux módile xèzya málka b-xêlme,} ""ánna ""álpa dáwe p>lêtla,}
pálga †làli} pálga †làlux?} ‘If I tell you what the king saw in his dream,
will you divide those thousand gold pieces, half for me and half
for you?’ (A1:6)
bas-""èn ""á°ya xá-baxta nabláli qa-kut-t-b9ya,} y6n-qa-xóna dìya,} ""ána btazàna.} ‘But, if a woman comes to take me to anyone she wants,
or to her brother, I shall go.’ (A8:78)
""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t ""alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘If you do not do the word of
God, you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)
""6n-lá-""az6n mšàyð6n.} ‘If I do not go, he will go mad.’ (A4:27)The qa†6l form occurs in the apodosis when there is a degree of uncertainty
concerning the occurrence of the situation. This is attested in contexts
where two possible alternative situations are referred to, e.g.
(5)
(6)""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ""u-""6n-""à°e} ""á°y6n mênne.} ‘If he is dead, I
must die. If he comes back, I shall come back with him.’ (A8:61)
""6n-""óð6t xàbri,} ""òð6t.} ""6n-lá ""òð6t,} kli°à-llux-ila.} ‘If you do as I say, you
will do so (so be it). If you do not do so, it is up to you.’ (A8:44)15.1.1.8. Irrealis Complement Clauses
The qa†6l form occurs in subordinate clauses that are complements of
various verbs and expressions when the action of the verb in the subordinate clause is as yet unrealized. It is used after verbs expressing desire
and permission (e.g. by ‘to want’, šwq, qbl ‘to permit’), and also in complements of various other verbs and predications where the action is as yet
unrealized relative to the main clause. The qa†6l form in the subordinate580chapter fifteenclause expresses perfective aspect, in that it presents the action as an event
with start and endpoint or at least one that is delimited by a start point
future to the present moment. It may also be used to denote an iterative
activity. In this function it is still perfective, since the speaker uses the
form that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence
of the iterated situation.
The verb of such subordinate clauses is sometimes introduced by the
subordinating particle D. This particle is, however, often omitted. Its omission is particularly common after the verb by ‘to want’, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""áp-""ana b8y6n ""àz6n.} ‘I also want to go.’ (A1:5)
b8y6n ""amrênn6x.} ‘I want to tell you.’ (A4:41)
b8ye ""á°e xazèlux.} ‘He wants to come and see you.’ (A4:24)
""ána b8y6n mênn6x} ""àwwa xóni} ""oðátle xá-ga xéta m>d6‰ètle nèšma dìye.} ‘I
want you to make my brother (alive) again and return his breath
to him.’ (A8:80)
b8y6x xá-m6ndi gu-t9ra qablítula.} ‘We want you to pledge her something on the doorstep.’ (B10:36)On some occasions, the particle occurs before the verb of the complement clause, e.g.
(6)
(7)b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
b8y6n ""álaha t-yawèlli mèndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
more.’ (A3:1)Examples with other verbs:
(8)""áp-xa la-qábl6t t-áw6r gu-bˆ°a.} ‘You should not allow anybody to
come into the house.’ (A23:25)
(9) d6-šúql6n dàmx6x.} ‘Allow us to us sleep.’ (A15:8)
(10) ""u-hálle ßàle,} šám6† qðále dìye.} ‘Let him go down (the mountain) and
break his neck.’ (A15:13)
(11) l7le ßbára t-áw6r xà.} ‘Nobody dares enter.’ (A32:32)
(12) ""o-t-l7le plíxa là sáp6r t-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has not worked should not
expect to eat.’ (A21:15)
The negative particle la is sometimes used in clauses that are the complement of the verb zd"" ‘to fear’, reflecting a negative deontic dimension to
the situation, e.g.","[615, 616, 617, 618, 619]"

(B5:99)
(3) ""ána b-zawnênne} ""ína ""6n-háwe †¬à ""aqlá°a.} ‘I shall buy it, but only if it

19.5.4. Conditional after the Verb ‘to wait’
A conditional clause introduced by the particle ""6n may be used as the
complement of the verb spr ‘to wait’, e.g.
(1) sàpri} ""6n-háwe pàwxa.} ‘They wait for there to be wind.’ (B5:97)
19.5.5. ""6n-la and ""6lla
The negation of a protasis that is placed before the apodosis is expressed
by combining the conditional particle with the negator in the uncontracted
phrase ""6n-lá with stress on the negator. This is typically used in contexts
where the clause expresses a negative alternative to a situation described in
the preceding context. As a result, the remaining content of the clause is
given or at least inferrable from what precedes and the main information
prominence is on the negator rather than the clause content, e.g.
(1) ""6n-mp5qèli} garš•tli †¬a-gére m•nne dìye.} ""u-""6n-là mp5qéli,} ""ána pálx6n b-réše
b>l?š.} ‘If I split it, you will produce for me three arrows from it.
If I do not split it, I shall work over it for free.’ (A12:44)
(2) ""6n-°èli} xó bàxtiw6t.} ""u-""6n-là-°eli,} kú-m6ndit ""áwð6t wùð.} ‘If I come back, then

(3) ""á puqdán6t ""alàh5le.} ""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘This is God’s
command (which you must obey). If you do not do the word of God,
you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)
The content of the protasis clause indeed is sometimes gapped completely, e.g.
(4) r8pili m-an-képe t-íla tàma,} ga-maxz•nnux ""úrxa ßàl6t.} ""6n-lá tàma t-áw6t.}
‘Throw me the stones that are there, then I shall show you the way

promise to marry him, he will give back the clothes. If not, he
will still give you the clothes, if you want them.’ (A14:83)The particle ""•lla, which is a contraction of ""6n-la with the stress on the
conditional particle rather than the negator, is used in clauses that come
after a negated main clause. The content of the clause introduced by ""•lla
has higher information value than a clause introduce by ""6n-lá. An ""•lla
clause is typically not given in the prior discourse whereas the preceding
main clause is bound to the preceding context in some way, e.g.
(7)
(8)
(9)b-‘u-""úrxa ""o-D6md•ma l7 šaqlìtule} ""•lla q>†ítula míy6t D6mdêma.} ‘By no
means will you capture D6md6ma unless you cut off the water of
D6md6ma.’ (A11:17)
x•tna lè-y-ax6l} ""•lla qablíle xà-m6ndi.} ‘The groom would not eat unless
they pledged something to him.’ (B10:40)
""ána mírt5w6n le-y-""á°y6n b-xábr6t ‘ù-""urza,} ""•lla t-á°ya báxta ma°yàli.}
‘I said that I would not come by the word of any man, unless a
woman came to fetch me.’ (A8:94)Occasionally a postposed protasis with ""6n-lá has a content that is not given
in the preceding context. In such cases, however, the clause generally still
does not have the same informational prominence as clauses introduced
by ""•lla. This is seen in (10) where the protasis clause expresses an action
that is circumstantial to the action of the main clause. The whole sentence
may be paraphrased ‘We brought in sticks having broken them’:
(10) ""áxni la-mor•xwa xa-s6ryóqa gu-b7°a ""6n-lá torêxwale.} ‘We would not
bring a single twig into the house without breaking it (literally: if
we did not break it).’ (B10:70)
On some occasions the content of a clause introduced by ""•lla is given in
the preceding context, but the speaker uses the construction to give the
clause enhanced prominence. It is typically used when the speaker wishes
to insist forcefully that something be done, e.g.","[1055, 1056, 1057]"
"the clause891(1) xo-là p7š6n š>vána-llux.} ‘I shall not become a shepherd for you.’
(A25:32)
(2) ""áxni b>yèxwa t-a°êxwa.} xu-là-mßaya t-a°èxwa t-amrèxwal6x.} ‘We wanted

(3) yába ""an-""èmma dàwe,} xu-là mbaqrêt6lli.} ‘Well, do not ask me about
those hundred gold coins.’ (A14:65)
17.7.14.2. Negative Particle before Other Constituents
The negative particle is sometimes placed before another component of
the clause that intervenes before the verb. This is found in the following
circumstances:
(i) Verb Not in Scope of Negation
One context where this is found is where the scope of the negator
includes this item but not the verb. In order for it to be within the scope
of the negation, it must be in the focus component of the clause. There
is, therefore, a narrow focus on the negated item, with the verb being in
the presupposition. The nuclear stress is sometimes, though not regularly,
placed on the negator before the item in narrow focus, as in (1)–(4):
(1) xzèla} ""ína núra †èpya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là-b5°a qíða,} xá‘‘a q7se rè˙qa m6nbˆ°e.} ‘They saw that fire had been kindled in his house, but his
house had not burnt down, only a few sticks far from his house
(had burnt).’ (A48:3)
(2) ""è°yela hìw6lla} ""áy mèra lˆk6t naból6lli?} mère ""ána làn †láli naból6ll6x.}
naból6ll6x †la-d-áwwa dewêrr6š.} ‘She said “Where are you taking me?”
He said “I am not taking you for myself. I am taking you for this
vagabond.” ’ (A12:35)
(3) là-kulley yapáwa.} ‘Not all of them used to bake.’ (B5:17)
(4) ""áx‘i là gu-""Ôn6 Núne q6m-""oðènne ""éða,} q6m-""oðènwale gu-Dòhok.} ‘But I did
not spend the festival in ""“n-Nune, I spent it in Dohok.’ (B15:9)
(5) lá kulla-náše y8ði t-oðìla.} ‘Not all people know how to make it.’
(B10:22)
(6) ""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ‘We do not use it much.’ (B10:18)
(7) ""ilan5ni t-xabušta. m-reša-w š6tta mnoqašta. l-Yaws6p zwinta b-dabašta. nèmu

(8) xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man.’ (A26:79)892chapter seventeenConstructions such as (9) and (10), in which the verb has been gapped,
can be included here:
(9)""áni maßlèxwa ""êrxe,} †axnêxwala.} là kúlla náše.} bas-""àxni.} ‘We brought
them down to the water-mill and ground them. Not everybody,
but we did (this).’ (B10:88)
(10) mattátla xa-kawáz6t míya k6s-réša-w bàs,} la-""ixàla,} la-lêxma.} ‘You should
put out for her a jar of water by her head and that’s all, not food,
nor bread.’ (A21:10)In (11) the item in the scope of negation is placed after the verb, with the
negative particle used both before this item and the verb:
(11) lá d5r7le là r6š-séla} ""i-maxíle gu-tanùra.} ‘They do not place it on a
griddle, they place it in the oven.’ (B6:49)
(ii) Constituents Coordinated in a Set Relation
The negative particle is placed before a subject constituent when the latter
is placed at the front of a clause in order to establish it in a set relationship
with an item in a coordinated adjacent clause and the scope of negation
includes the subject, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)la-k yàsa m>ráwa} ""u-la-xàßa m>réwa,} la-∂á©a† y-awèwale.} ‘(One’s) stomach did not ache, (one’s) back did not ache and one did not have
(high blood) pressure.’ (B5:31)
""ána lˆ-gor6n,} la-""àti gáwr6t.} ‘I shall not marry, so long as you do not
marry.’ (A25:83)
la-""áxnix xàla} ""u-lá sus>wà°6n xála.} ‘Neither are we eating nor are
our horses eating.’ (A26:16)If the items that are coordinated in a set relationship across a series of
two or more clauses are not subject constituents, a second negator is often
placed before the item in question, in addition to a negator in the normal
position in the clause, e.g.
(4)lá-karmi l5le-m>dò‰e} ""u-la-˙áqq6t kàrmi l5le-yáwa.} ‘He does not return
my orchard nor does he pay the price.’ (A17:30)Constituents that are coordinated in this way include the resultative participle and infinitive of compound verbal constructions, e.g.","[929, 930, 931]"
"598chapter fifteenIn (12) the second mention of the act of throwing the coin is expressed
by a ""i-qa†6lwa form (""i-daríwa). The purpose is not to present this act as
more noteworthy than the acts that follow it. Rather it is used to mark a
boundary in discourse structure, namely the onset of a sequence of clauses
describing the game at the pool. Similarly in (13) the second mention of
the placing of the bride on the back of a mule, which is expressed by a
""i-qa†6lwa form, marks the onset of a sequence of clauses that describe
the event known as ‘appe buke.
The ""i-qa†6lwa form in (14) marks the beginning of a span of discourse
that elaborates and expands on the previous general statement that they
gave the fallen apples to the animals. It coincides with a shift from general
to specific perspective.
On some occasions the ""i-qa†6lwa form is used to signal the closure of
a discourse section. Again, the primary purpose is not to give particular
prominence to the semantic content of this final action in the section, but
rather to use it as a boundary marker in the discourse structure. This is
the case, for example, in (15), where the man’s going to sleep is the final
event of his working day, but is not intended to be interpreted as the
most important one:
(15) kút-yum šúle díye mòdi-wewa?} šaqêlwale táwre díye} ""u-šaqêlwa xmáre díye}
qèdamta} y-azèlwa z>rèwa} ""u-y-a°éwa l-bˆ°a,} y-axèlwa mèndi ""i-damêxwa.}
‘Everyday what was his job? He would take his ox and take his
ass early in the morning and go to cultivate (his field). He would
then come back home, eat something and go to sleep.’ (A21:4)
15.1.5. b6d-qa†6l
The prefixed particle b6d- in this form is generally phonetically reduced in
natural fast speech to bt-, t- or b- (cf. §8.6.2.), e.g. ""ána bt-àz6n} ‘I shall go’
(A8:51), t-azítu ‘You shall go’ (A8:27), b-tàr6ß ‘He will be cured’ (A8:33).
15.1.5.1. Predictive Future
One of the basic functions of the b6d-qa†6l form is to express the future
tense. In cases where the subject of the verb is 3rd person or where it is a
non-agentive 1st or 2nd person, this is generally a predictive future, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)b-nayêsli} t-axêlli.} ‘He will bite me. He will eat me.’ (A1:17)
""áp-""ana b-qa†êlli.} ‘He will kill me also.’ (A42:3)
""áy hóla dmìxta.} yóm6t ""àrbi b-q7ma.} ‘She is asleep. On the fortieth
day she will get up.’ (A24:17)the syntax of verbs
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)599táma b-xáz6t xa-†úra ramàna.} ‘There you will see a high mountain.’
(A8:47)
b-qlábtux b-xazènna Bèlb6l Hazàr mènnux.} ‘When you return I shall
see B6lb6l Hazar with you.’ (A8:52)
""áy šaqí°a bt-áza. ‘The channel will flow.’ (A8:11)
kút-yom t-á°i làxxa.} ‘They will come here every day.’The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start and
end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express iterative aspect (7). In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfective, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation.
The predicted events may be about to occur in the very near future, as
is shown by (8) and (9), where the verb is used with the adverb ‘now’:
(8)
(9)hadíya t-à°ya Zíne,} ""arbí b5rbiyá°a mênna.} ‘Now Zine is going to come
with forty bridesmaids.’ (A26:78)
díya t-á°i p5rmìl6n.} ‘Now they are going to come to slaughter us.’
(A4:54)The expression of imminence may be intensified by the phrase h6nt-ila ‘It
is a little’ (Kurd. hind), e.g.
(10) hènt-ila t-à°e} ‘He will come very soon’
The b6d-qa†6l form is used as a future tense in direct or indirect interrogative clauses, e.g.
(11) ""7ka b-kále Gozàli?} ‘Where will Gozali stay?’ (A8:51)
(12) xáz6x mò-t-aw6ð.} ‘Let’s see what he will do.’ (A4:21)
(13) xáz6n mó bt-amêrri.} ‘I’ll see what he’ll say to me.’ (A8:43)
15.1.5.2. Deontic Future
When the verb has an agentive 1st singular subject the b6d-qa†6l form
generally has a modal sense expressing deontic intention, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)b-ßàly6n} b-tápq6n bìye.} ‘I shall go down to meet him.’ (A4:21)
""àp-""ana bt-áz6n šúla} pàlx6n.} ‘I also shall go and work.’ (A23:1)
b-zonènne b-xamšì dináre.} ‘I shall buy it for fifty dinars.’ (A24:23)
t-yawènnux zùzux.} ‘I shall give you your money.’ (A1:10)600chapter fifteenThe intention may be to perform the action in the immediate future,
e.g.
(5)hadíya b-zadrànna gáni.} ‘Now I am going to shake myself.’ (A24:27)When expressing deontic intention the b6d-qa†6l form is occasionally combined with the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, e.g.
(6)
(7)""ána d6-t-amrènnox ""ó-mdi-t taxrênne.} ‘I shall tell you what I remember.’
(B15:1)
pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘I shall give him half of my gold.’
(A14:92)When the verb has an agentive 1st plural subject, the form often has a
cohortative modal sense (Let’s . . .), e.g.
(8)
(9)bt-àrqexi.} ‘Let’s flee.’ (A30:41)
bas-t-ázexi †albèxla m-bába dìya.} ‘But let us go and ask her father for
her hand.’ (A29:38)
(10) b-súr6° l7ð6n mú y-amrìle,} t-ámr6x mtag6bràna.} ‘I do not know what
they call it in sur6°, let’s say “governor.” ’ (B6:47)The form may express deontic obligation. In such cases the verb generally
has an agentive 2nd person subject, e.g.
(11) ""ati bt-àzet.} ‘You should go.’ (A8:46)
(12) t-azítu qam-d-o-gêppa,} ""aw-gèppa rába ramàn5le.} b-qarìtu:} ""ó Bèlb6l Hazàr!}
‘You should go to the cave, the cave is very high. You should cry
“Oh B6lb6l Hazar.” ’ (A8:28)
(13) b-zˆn6t} gót6t d-an-xoránux xène} ""u-b-qàr6t.} t-ámr6t ""ó Bèlb6l Hazàr!} ‘You
should stand next to the others, your friends, and call out. You
should say “Oh B6lb6l Hazar!” ’ (A8:48)
Occasionally the form expresses deontic obligation also in other persons,
e.g.
(14) t-áz6l †alèbla m-be-bába diya.} ‘He should go and ask her father’s
family for her hand.’ (A29:39)
(15) ""èlla b-šaqlênna} xá°6t Mir-Zándin barxênna-llux.} ‘But I must first take
the sister of Mir Zandin to marry her to you.’ (A26:39)the syntax of verbs601When used in questions the form can sometimes be interpreted as expressing deontic obligation (‘What should he do?’) or deontic possibility (‘What
can he do?’), whereby the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to
impose an obligation or give permission, e.g.
(16) políse mù t-óði?} ‘What should/can the police do?’ (A8:9)
(17) mó t-oðèna?} ‘What should/can I do?’ (A1:17)
(18) mò t-ámr6n ""ána?} ‘What should/can I say?’ (A26:34)
It is occasionally used to express deontic possibility in other contexts, for
example in the expression t-amr6t ‘you could say’, which is used to introduce comparative descriptions as in (19) and (20):
(19) rqàð5la,} ""u-píšla t-ámr6t xlùl5le táma.} ‘They danced and you could
say that (= it seemed that) there was a wedding there.’ (A35:7)
(20) ""o-kêlša} rába qùwy5wa,} yá'ni m-bár xá ""6ßrá yomà°a,} yá'ni t-amrètte
dabêšwa,} kúlla t-amrètte dabèšwa xá kèpa yá'ni,} képa-w kêlša.} ‘After
about ten days, you could say concerning it (= it seems) that it
stuck together, you could say concerning it (= it seems) that the
gypsum all stuck together in a single stone.’ (B5:185)
15.1.5.3. Conditional Constructions
The b6d-qa†6l form is used in the apodosis of conditional sentences. In
the majority of cases it expresses an action that is temporally sequential
to a hypothetical situation in the future. As elsewhere the form should
be interpreted as perfective, expressing a complete action with start and
end point or an action that is at least delimited with a start point that is
sequential to the situation described in the protasis, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)""6n-háwe t-têrte ""aqlá°a,} ""ána b-zawnênne.} ‘If it were two legged, I
would buy it.’ (A22:5)
""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
""6n-kpìnni,} t-axlênne.} ‘If I am hungry, I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)
""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ‘If you know (the answer
to) my test, I shall indeed then marry you.’ (A25:62)
""6n-""amrènnux ""áp-""ati b-šàn6t.} ‘If I tell you, you will faint.’ (A11:2)
""6n-""ánna mt>m6mêtla,} ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘If you fulfil these (conditions),
I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)
""6n-""axlíl6n š6kwáne t-axlìl6n.} ‘If the ants eat us, they shall eat us.’
(A14:52)602chapter fifteenIn some cases it expresses a future action that follows logically from a
given, real situation in the present denoted by the protasis clause, e.g.
(8) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila.} ‘If he is my nephew, he
will come and he will know what these are.’ (A25:49)
(9) ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka btáz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)
15.1.5.4. Discourse Dependency
In conditional constructions such as those illustrated in §15.1.5.3. the
action in the apodosis is presented from the viewpoint of the situation
in the protasis and always has a future reference relative to this viewpoint. On some occasions the b6d-qa†6l form expresses dependency on a
preceding clause outside of conditional constructions. In such cases the
action in the b6d-qa†6l clause is not presented from the viewpoint of the
preceding clause and so does not necessarily have future time reference.
It may have present time reference. The form is perfective, delimited
either by a start and end point or at least by a start point that is sequential to what precedes. It may also express iterative aspect, but still should
be interpreted as perfective, in that it expresses one occurrence of an
event that is representative of the iterated situation. The b6d- prefix in
these constructions has lost the function of future temporal reference
but expresses only dependency. This dependency make take the form of
temporal sequentiality as in (1)–(5), e.g.
(1) ""èrbe máxe l-©ðàðe,} t-ázi xa-fàtra,} ""al-salíq6 zòrna.} máxe zórna xa-salíqa
xèna,} ""èrbe b-dˆri,} b-ganèy.} ‘He gathers the sheep together and they go
off for a while according to the tune of the pipe. He plays another
tune on the pipe and the sheep return, by themselves.’ (A25:27)
(2) ""u-zíl5le t-áz6l ""á°‰6t bàb6 d-5-bráta.} ‘He set off and went to the land
of the girl’s father.’ (A29:34)
(3) b-l7le qímla šárya b>núda dìya,} t-àza,} p°íxla t8ra qðìla.} ‘At night she
got up, untied her bands, then went and opened the door with a
key.’ (A18:3)
(4) ""u-šuréle 'ajòze} yá'ni k‘àxa.} ""u-t-lá xàl6†} t-ám6r ya-""álaha šqùlli.} ‘He had
started to get incapable and tired and, in order for him not to commit an error, he says “Oh God, take me!” ’ (A15:19)
(5) bá°6r ""éða gò‰a} y-á°e ""arbì-yome} bá°6r ""éða d-o-gò‰a} ""ì°ena} ""éð6t sulàqa.}
. . . xàr°a} t-á°e xá-""eða xréna zòra,} y-amríle ""éð6t musàrde.} ‘After the Greatthe syntax of verbs603Festival, forty days after the Great Festival, the festival of Ascension
takes place. . . . Afterwards comes a small festival, which is called
musarde.’ (B6:5–8)
In some cases the b6d-qa†6l form does not express temporal sequentiality but
only some kind of relevance to a preceding clause. Consider (6) and (7):
(6) báw°6 Ninwàye} ""áp-""ay ""ìtwa.} ß5mìla.} t-ámri díge-w k°àye} ""áp ""an-zóre
xtàye.} ‘The Rogation of the Ninevites was also observed (in our
community). They would fast during it. They would say “The cocks
and the chickens, and also the small lowly creatues (should observe
the fast).” ’ (B16:15)
(7) ""ána háw6n Qára Tè≥din,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye.} t-á°e xa-""árxa
""ax-d-àwwa} gu-bˆ°i} ""u-pál6† l7ð6n lˆk5le zála,} l7ka là!} ‘I am Qara
Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people of Botan, and a
guest comes like this into my house and leaves without me knowing
where on earth he was going!’ (A26:34)
In (6) the clause introduced by the verb t-ámri consitutes an elaboration
of the preceding statement that people would hold a fast, which could
be paraphrased ‘with regard to this fasting they say. . . .’ In (7) the b6d-qa†6l
form verb t-á°e denotes an action that is to be interpreted in the context
of the speaker having a high social position, which is expressed by the
statement ‘I am Qara Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people of
Botan’. In (6) and (7) the b6d-qa†6l verbs do not express sequentiality but
nevertheless they are in some way dependent on what precedes. In (6)
it may be said that the clause with the b6d-qa†6l form introduces background to the preceding foreground, whereas in (7) the form introduces
a foregrounded statement that is to be interpreted against the preceding
background.
The fact that the use of the b6d-qa†6l form may be motivated by the
broad property of relevance to what precedes implies that it could be
used anywhere within a section of discourse, since, in principle, all clauses
would be in some way relevant to what precedes. This is how we should
understand its use with the verb ""mr ‘to say’ within sections of expository
discourse such as (8) and (9), where they have habitual aspect:
(8) m-l5le mbàdla táma,} yá'ni mbarxìwa.} y-a°éwa qàša.} har-gu-bˆ°a} y-as‰íwale
gnùna-w} yá'ni t-ámr6x mbarxìwale.} ‘In the early morning they would
perform the blessing (of the wedding ceremony) there. A priest604(9)chapter fifteen
would come. In the house they would tie the band. We say “They
blessed it.” ’ (B5:30)
béna bálki ""o-nàša,} ""o-xêtna t-ámr6x,} ""o-""ùrza,} lè-y-awe táma.} ‘Perhaps
the person, we say the groom, the man, was not there.’ (B5:18)These b6d-qa†6l forms of ""mr are used interchangeably with the ""i-qa†6l
form, e.g.
(10) y-atwíwa b-dawˆre,} ""7-ga b-dawˆre,} . . . koðênta y-amrèxxa.} ‘They would
sit on mules, at that time (they sat) on mules, .. a koð6nta (‘female
mule’) we call it.’ (B5:28)
In (11) the b6d-qa†6l form is used in clauses that depend on what precedes
in that they have the status of non-restrictive relative clauses qualifying a
head noun in the first clauses. This is similar to the elaborative function
in (6) above:
(11) kút-naša gu-""Ón-Núne ""ítle xaqlà°a,} b-z>rèla} zrùta,} ""6n-t-awèdla bustàne,}
""6n-t-awèdle kù-mdi-t b8ye.} ‘Everybody in ""“n-Nune has fields, which
he cultivates, or he makes into an orchard or whatever he wants.’
(B4:2)
15.1.5.5. Negation of b6d-qa†6l Forms
The negative particle cannot be combined with the b6d-qa†6l form. To
express the negative, the negated form of the qa†6l or ""i-qa†6l form is used,
viz. la-qa†6l or la-y-qa†6l respectively. As described in §8.9., there are various
phonetic variants of the la-y-qa†6l form, which exhibit various degrees of
contaction, viz. le-y-qa†6l, l5-qa†6l, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""ána là-""a°6n mènnux.} †la-mò la-""á°6t mènni?} sí là-""a°6n mènnux ""ána.} ‘ “I
shall not come with you.” “Why won’t you come with me?” “Go
away, I shall not come with you.” ’ (A6:6)
qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)
lá masp6rèxl6x bi-zàwda.} ‘We shall not make you wait more.’
(A4:41)
lè-y-axlena.} ‘I shall not eat.’ (B5:35)
""ána m-axxa-húdxa lè-y-az6n.} ‘I shall not go beyond here.’ (A12:23)
""ána là-y-asq6n.} ‘I shall not go up.’ (A32:29)the syntax of verbs605(7) bas-lè-y-y6nna bná°i-ll5xu.} ‘But I shall not give my daughters to you.’
(A12:17)
The ""i-qa†6l form is used elsewhere to express imperfective habitual aspect.
As remarked above, however, the positive b6d-qa†6l form is intrinsically perfective. The explanation appears to be that the positive future perfective
form asserts that a specific action will take place at a particular point in
time whereas its negated form should properly be interpreted as expressing an enduring property of the subject referent rather than referring to
an event that is bound to a particular point in time. When a speaker says
t-axl6n ‘I shall eat’, he is asserting that there will be a particular point in
time when he will eat. When he says le-y-axl6n, on the other hand, the
sense is ‘I have the property of not eating’. The salience of the particular point in time of an action is diffused when it is negated to the extent
that an imperfective form is used. The use of the negated qa†6l form,
viz. la-qa†6l, should, likewise, be interpreted as expressing a non-punctual
habitual imperfective aspect.
A parallel to this diffusion of the salient temporal punctuality of a perfective form by negation is found in the imperative. Imperative forms express
a more salient, immediate command than deontic qa†6l forms. Although
imperatives can be negated, there is a greater tendency for negated commands to be expressed by qa†6l forms than is the case with positive commands (for further details see §15.7.). In some NENA dialects, furthermore,
a negated command can only be expressed by a qa†6l form.
15.1.6. b6d-qa†6lwa
15.1.6.1. Conditional Constructions
The b6d-qa†6lwa form, with the past converter suffix -wa, is used in the
apodosis of conditional sentences that refer to a hypothetical condition in
the past, which was not fulfilled (1–2), or to a hypothetical condition in
the present or future, which the speaker assesses to be impossible to fulfil
(3–4). The verb form expresses an action that is temporally or logically
sequential to the situation expressed in the protasis. Since it is delimited
by a starting point that is sequential to what precedes, it is inherently
perfective, e.g.
(1) ""6n-mbaqrêtwa,} t-yawènwalux zùze,} bás là mbuqèrrux.} ‘If you had asked,
I would have given you money, but you did not ask.’606chapter fifteen(2) ""6n-y>ðènwa manay-díye mòdiwa,} t-amrênwalux,} bas-là y>ð6…wa.} ‘If I had
known what its meaning was, I would have told you, but I did not
know.’
(3) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa,} bás lè-y-maß6n.} ‘If I could, I would come, but
I cannot.’
(4) ""6n-hawètwa gu-""á°‰a dìyi,} kú-m6ndi b>yètwa t-yànwalux.} ‘If you were in
my country, I would give you whatever you wanted.’ (A26:57)
The form may also express iterative aspect. In this context the form can
still be interpreted as perfective in that the speaker uses the form that is
appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation, e.g.
(5) ""6n-maßènwa t-yawènwalux zúze kùt-yum,} t-yawênwalux,} bás le-y-maßênwa.}
‘If I had been able to give you money every day, I would have given
it to you, but I could not.’
(6) ""6n-maßènwa t-yawènwalux zúze kùt-yum,} t-yawênwalux,} bas le-y-màß6n.}
‘If I could give you money every day, I would give it to you, but I
cannot.’
15.1.6.2. Deontic Constructions
The b6d-qa†6lwa form is used in questions relating to counterfactual situations in the past. They are of a deontic nature, in that the speaker addresses
the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation (deontic necessity: ‘What
should I have done?’) or give permission (deontic possibility: ‘What could
I have done?’), e.g.
(1) ""ína m-ˆka} t-óð6nwale gèšra?} ‘But from where could I have made him
a bridge?’ (A17:18)
(2) gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘(Why) should I have been finished off by your stupid club (literally: the club of your behind)?!’
(A52:17)
15.1.6.3. Discourse Dependency
The b6d-qa†6lwa form is used outside of conditional constructions in clauses
that are in some way dependent on the preceding discourse. In such cases
the verb always expresses an iterative action. Various types of discourse
dependency are attested in the text corpus. In (1) and (2) the b6d-qa†6lwa
verbs are temporally sequential to what precedes:the syntax of verbs607(1) ‘5rxìwala má°a} xáß6 dawˆre.} y-amríwa ‘áppe bùkela.} ""ay-t-a°yàwa,}
t-oràwa,} maxyáwa . . . mêšxa} ""u-t-oðáwa ßlìwa,} mêšxa,} gu-t8r6t qàßra.} ‘They
would take her (the bride) round the village on the back of mules.
They called it ‘appe buke. (Then) she would come back, enter (the
house) and make with oil . . . and make (the sign of ) the cross in oil
on the door of the house.’ (B10:34–35)
(2) la-°éle rèš-ßàwma?} b-šaqlèxwa kúlla ""amàn6n,} kùlla b-šaqlèxwala} d7r6xwa
qè†ma mxallêxwala.} ‘When the beginning of the (Lent) fast came, we
would take all our vessels, we would take them all and put ash on
them to clean them.’ (B16:7)
Other types of dependency are exhibited by the verb forms in the following examples:

anything on account of the winter. So much snow fell that people
could not go out even to here. We sat in the house.’ (B16:27)
In (3) the clause containing the first b6d-qa†6lwa verb, bt-azíwa, opens a section of discourse that elaborates on the preceding general statement that608chapter fifteenthe festival of Girls’ Sunday took place. The dependency expressed by
the verbal form binds it semantically to what precedes signalling that the
description of the specific event in the clause is intended to be understood
as a component of the festival. This example also contains a subsequent
chain of b6d-qa†6lwa forms (b-šaqlíwa . . . t-azíwa . . . t-atwìwa . . . t-axlìwa,
b-šatìwa). The clauses containing these verbs are also elaborative of the
initial general statement. Most of them can also be interpreted as temporally sequential to the clause immediately preceding it. The semantic
dependency in these clauses consists of both the relation of specific to
general and also temporal sequence.
Example (4) is similar to (3). The first b6d-qa†6lwa verb, t-a°7wa, occurs
in a clause at the onset of a section of discourse that describes the specific events of the general event of selling the tree. The discourse dependency, therefore, is the relationship of specific to general. The subsequent
b6d-qa†6lwa verbs (t-ám6rwa . . . t-ám6rwa) are, likewise, specifying this general
event, but also are temporally sequential to what immediately precedes
them.
The clause containing the b6d-qa†6lwa verb in (5) occurs at the onset
of a section that elaborates on the preceding statement concerning the
roof of the church.
The relationship of the verb t-attèxwa in (6) to what precedes is one of
effect to cause, i.e. people could not go out on account of the snow and
for this reason we sat in the house.
15.1.6.4. Negation of b6d-qa†6lwa Forms
There is a similar constraint against combining the negative particle with
the b6d-qa†6lwa as there is with the b6d-qa†6l form. To express negation, the
negated qa†6lwa and ""i-qa†6lwa forms are used suppletively, e.g.
(1) xà-m6nn5xu b-taréwa} ""u-xéna là taréwa.} ‘One of you would get wet
and the other would not get wet.’ (A17:18)
(2) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa lèxma,}
""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare
were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this miserable condition, you would not be sitting here and have become so
poor.’ (A17:16)
(3) ""áp-""6n mbaqrêtwa,} le-y-yawènwalux zùze.} ‘Even if you had asked, I
would not have given you money.’the syntax of verbs60915.1.7. q6m-qa†6l
15.1.7.1. Preliminary Remarks
This form is used before pronominal L-suffixes, i.e. q6m-qa†6lle, q6m-qa†6lla,
q6m-qa†6ll5, etc. The L-suffixes may express the direct object or the indirect object. It expresses a past perfective aspect. As has been remarked
(§15.1.1.1.), the qa†6l form without additional affixes may express a present
perfective. The q6m-qa†6l form has been formed by attaching the prefix
q6m- to this perfective qa†6l base. The q6m- prefix is likely to be a fossilized
form of the old suffix conjugation form *qadd6m ‘He did (something) beforehand’.2 In some isolated cases before initial /""/ verbs, the subordinating
D particle is inserted between the q6m and the verb, e.g. q6m-t-amèrra ‘He
said to her’ (A4:4).
There is no functional difference between the q6m-qa†6l form and the
q†ille form, which also expresses past perfective aspect. The q6m-qa†6l form
is used as a more versatile means of expressing the past perfective with
L-suffixes. Direct or indirect pronominal objects of the 3rd person may
be expressed by incorporation into the past base q†ille form, e.g. q†ille ‘He
killed him’, q†ilale ‘He killed her’, q†ilile ‘He killed them’. The q6m-qa†6l
form is the usual means of expressing pronominal objects of the 1st and
2nd person on a past perfective verb and it expresses 3rd person objects
interchangeably with the q†ille form with object incorporation.
15.1.7.2. Recent Past Events
In conversational discourse the normal function of the q6m-qa†6l form is to
express with perfective aspect the occurrence of a punctual event in the
recent past. The margin of the recent past may extend up to the present
moment. The form may be used, therefore, when the endpoint of the event
is witnessed in the present moment. It is appropriate to translate the form
in such contexts by the English perfect of recent past. Examples of this
are found in the text corpus, mainly in sections of direct speech, e.g.
(1) ""áti q6m-xalßàtli} m6n-d-áwwa mò°a.} ‘You have saved me from death.’
(A14:35)2
In many NENA dialects the prefix has an /a/ vowel (qam-). In Barwar the attenuation
of the /a/ to /6/ is regular and the form contrasts with the particle qam ‘before’, which
generally preserves the /a/ (§2.3.5.). In the C. Sulemaniyya and C. Sanandaj dialects the
auxiliary verb *qadd6m has developed into the form tam- with the elision of the first syllable
and devoicing of the medial *d.","[636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648]"
"the syntax of verbs661and nothing of the event of his coming is to be seen. The form °ele would
be used if any phase of the event of coming can be seen directly by the
speaker, even if this is only the static endpoint of his standing at the door.
One says dìya °éle} ‘He has come just now’ referring explicitly to the fact
that the endpoint of the event coincides with the present moment, but the
expression *diya hole ""6°ya would not be felicitous. The resultative form is
disconnected from the event also referentially in that it does not make any
direct reference to the specific event that caused the result in question.
The result expressed by the resultative form may be an actual perceptible
situation or an experiential property of the subject referent, e.g.
(1) hón xíla gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten stew.’
(2) xílli gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten the stew.’
Example (1) may be interpreted as asserting that at the present moment
there is a perceptible result of my having eaten stew at some unspecified
time in the past, e.g. I had a large stew for lunch and cannot eat much
dinner. This construction could also be interpreted as asserting that I have
the permanent property of being in the state of having eaten stew, i.e.
it has been part of my life experience. In this interpretation it denotes
that on some occasion, possibly on more than one occasion, I have eaten
stew, though not necessarily recently. The purpose of the deictic copula
in both interpretations would be to draw attention to the relevance of the
past event to the present moment in time. In both cases there is a degree
of indeterminateness concerning the event. The verbal form implies the
existence of at least one unspecified member of the set of past events of
eating. In the first interpretation the implication from the discourse context
in which it is used (e.g. in response to the question ‘Why do you not want
to eat your dinner?’) is that there was only one unspecified event. In the
experiential interpretation the possibility remains open that there were
more than one. In example (2) the q†ille form, by contrast, refers to the
occurrence of one specific event that occurred at a specific point in time
in the recent past. In such a construction the noun g6rðo would, therefore,
normally be definite with a specific identifiable referent.
The context may force a definite interpretation of an object nominal
of a resultative construction, e.g.
(3) A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: hón xíl6lle gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I
have eaten the stew.” ’662
(4)chapter fifteen
A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: xílli gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I have
eaten the stew.” ’The difference between these is as follows. The resultative construction in
(3) asserts a present state that is disconnected temporally from the event that
caused it, so the event must have happened at some time in the past that
is not adjacent to the present moment, e.g. several hours ago or yesterday.
The q†ille form would be used as in (4) when the endpoint of the past event
is adjacent to the present, i.e. I have just now eaten it, where a translation
with the English perfect of recent past would be appropriate.
The indeterminateness of the event signified by the resultative form
means that the individual referents of plural nouns or nouns of mass in
the clause can be interpreted as being distributed over more than one
event during a particular duration of time, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)""èdyo hón xíla rába xabùše.} ‘Today I have eaten many apples.’
""èdyo hóla ""è°ye rába nàše.} ‘Today many people have come.’
""èdyo hón xíla lêxma.} ‘Today I have eaten bread.’Example (5), with a plural patient argument ‘apples’, can be interpreted as
meaning that during the course of today up to the present moment there
have been various occasions on which I have eaten apples. The consumption of ‘many apples’ may have been distributed over various events, with
a few apples being eaten on each occasion. It could also be interpreted
as denoting the result of a single event of apple eating. Likewise example
(6), which has a plural subject argument, can be interpreted as meaning
either that the ‘many people’ came separately in a series of discrete events
or that they arrived together. The construction reports only that ‘many
people’ are in the resultant state of ‘having come’, without denoting that
this was the result of one or of a series of events. The interpretation of
(7), which has a noun of mass ‘bread’ as an object argument, could be
that I have eaten some bread on various occasions today or on only one
occasion. Contrast this with the equivalent clauses with q†ille forms:
(8) ""èdyo xílli rába xabùše.} ‘Today I ate many apples.’
(9) ""èdyo °éla rába nàše.} ‘Today many people came.’
(10) ""èdyo xílli lêxma.} ‘Today I ate bread.’
The q†ille form denotes a specific event and (8)–(10) must be interpreted
as referring to single events. The adverbial ""6dyo ‘today’ would normallythe syntax of verbs663force the interpretation that the endpoint of these events occurred before
the present moment and so they must be translated with the English
preterite.
In some circumstances the context indicates the specific event that
caused the present result. If, for example, the clause contains a punctual
time adverbial binding the event to a particular point in time with no
duration, the event is fully specified. Clauses containing the resultative
form combined with such time adverbials, therefore, assert the existence
of a present state and the context signals that it has been caused by this
specific event. These would still differ from corresponding clauses with the
q†ille form, which assert the occurrence of the event but the existence of a
present state is only a possible implicature, which may be cancelled. Note
that in English the present perfect is not used when the clause contains
such time adverbials, e.g.
(11) xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at
half past nine.’
(12) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at half
past nine.’
The construction (11) with the resultative form asserts that my brother is
currently in the state of ‘having come’ and so would be the natural construction to use if he is still here. Construction (12) could be interpreted
as implying that he is still here, but this implicature could be cancelled
and the form would still be felicitous (13). Any corresponding denial of
the existence of the present result with the resultative construction would
not be felicitous (14), e.g.
(13) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás plí†le bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My brother
came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’
(14) ?? xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás hóle plí†a bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My
brother came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’
The functional features of the resultative that have been described above
are also discernible in its negated form l5le q†ila. The negative form l5le
""6°ya ‘He has not come’ can be analysed as meaning that he is currently
not in a state of ‘having come’. Thus no specific event is negated. The
implication is that no event of coming has occurred at any time. The
negative la q†ille form, on the other hand, negates the occurrence of a specific event in the recent past. The event has its specificity and definiteness664chapter fifteenby being bound to a particular point in time in the discourse context.
Consider (15):
(15) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmo
la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)
Here the question with the negated q†ille form la-qìmlux is intended to
ask why the addressee did not get up specifically at the time that the
speaker greeted him. The translation of such negated q†ille forms by the
English perfect of recent past is appropriate in a context where an event
was expected to occur and the endpoint of its occurrence was expected
to be adjacent with the present. If somebody is expected to arrive at a
house at a particular time, somebody in the house may say °èle? ‘Has he
come?’ The response to this could be là °éle ‘He has not come’, which
would deny that he has come at this expected specific point in time in
the recent past, with no necessary implication that he will come in the
future. After uttering this, it would be appropriate to assert an action that
is sequential to this specific point in time, e.g. là °éle.} ""àz6x.} ‘He has not
come. Let’s go’. The negated q†ille form là-°ela in (16) from the text corpus
should be interpreted in this way:
(16) xéna ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra,} ""ánna xon>wá°a là-°ela.} ‘Well, I shall
go to church. These brothers have not come back (now when I
expected them to come).’ (A37:2)
Note also (17), in which the absence of expectation that the man will
come in the future is made explicit:
(17) xóni zílle ""u-lá °èle.} ""u-díya ""ána hon-xšáwa leš-""à°e.} ‘My brother has
gone and has not come back, and now I think he will no longer
come back.’ (A8:60)
The negated q†ille form can be combined with the temporal adverbial particles referring to the present moment, such as heš ‘still’ and hal-diya ‘until
now’. These underscore that the action that is negated was expected to
happen at a point in the immediate past adjacent to the present moment,
e.g. heš-là °éle,} ""àz6x!; hal-díya là °éle,} ""àz6x!} These could be paraphrased:
We have waited for him until the present moment, when he was expected
to come, but he has not come at the expected time, so now let’s go.","[699, 700, 701, 702, 703]"

It turned itself round. I thought it would not strike me. It turned
itself round . . . It gave me a kick.’ (B5:131–132)
In the light of the foregoing, it is easiest to regard the q†il5le preterite as a
narrative verbal form, characteristic of fictitious discourse, which originally
developed in imitation of the use of the Turkish evidential verbal forms
with -mi{ in fictitious narrative. It did not, however, come to be used as a
fully functional evidential form that could be used outside of narrative.
15.4.1.4. Movement of the Enclitic Copula
As remarked, positive assertive resultative constructions can have the
enclitic or the deictic copula. If special prominence is given to a particular constituent of the clause, however, only the enclitic copula is used. In
such circumstances this is moved from the participle and attached to the
prominent constituent in question. In most cases the constituent that is
given prominence in this way is placed before the participle, whatever its
grammatical function in the clause, and so the movement of the enclitic
is leftwards. In some constructions in narrative the enclitic moves rightwards and is attached to a constituent that occurs after the participle in
the clause.
15.4.1.4.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic
In constructions where the enclitic copula is moved leftwards it is important
to distinguish cases where the constituent that is given prominence bears
the nuclear stress and cases where the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere
in the clause. As a general rule, prominent items bearing the nuclear
stress are clausal arguments expressing some kind of information focus,
by which the speaker wishes to draw the hearer’s attention to important
new information. This may be termed ‘narrow’ focus, in that attention is
drawn to one particular argument in the clause and not to the predicate
or overall proposition as a whole. The normal default position for the678chapter fifteennuclear stress is at the end of the intonation group. Since the focused item
is placed at the beginning of the clause the nuclear stress is in a marked
position. Items given prominence that do not bear the nuclear stress, on
the other hand, are generally not a focus of new information.
(i) Narrow New Information Focus
One type of narrow new information focus that is expressed by the attachment of the enclitic copula is contrastive focus. This is used when the
speaker wishes to correct a misunderstanding by strongly asserting that
one particular item should be selected for the role in question rather than
the one currently entertained by the hearer, e.g.
(1) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} brònux-ile xíla xabúša.} ‘A: “Your brother
has eaten an apple.” B: “No, your son has eaten an apple.” ’
(2) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
“Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
a peach. He has not eaten an apple.’ ”
(3) A: xóni hóle xèzya brat7xu qedàmta} B: l7le qedàmta xèzya brát6n,} têmm6l-ile
xèzy6lla.} ‘A: “My brother saw your daughter this morning.” B: “He
did not see our daughter this morning, he saw her yesterday.” ’
Examples from the text corpus:
(4) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I did
not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of his
sister.’ (A8:85)
(5) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
(A24:31)
(6) yába ""àn6n mšúdr6lla!} ‘I (not God) have sent them!’ (A6:4)
(7) ""àn6n xèzy6lle,} dìyile.} ‘I (and nobody else) have found it. It is mine.’
(A14:15)
(8) ""ànna} Sêttiyela mutt7°6lla láxxa.} ‘S6ttiye (not anybody else) put these
here.’ (A25:36)
In principle when the speaker expresses a narrow focus on one particular
argument of the clause, the proposition of the clause is presupposed to
be known to the hearer and activated in his mind with the exception of
the identity of the argument in question. In (1), for example, the clause
brònux-ile xíla xabúša} is used by the speaker when he presupposes that the
hearer knows that somebody has eaten an apple, i.e. the presuppositionalthe syntax of verbs679background is ‘x has eaten an apple’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the
new information that he is conveying, is that x is to be identified as ‘your
son’.8 In many languages this type of argument focus can be expressed
by a cleft sentence, e.g. ‘It is your son who has eaten an apple’, in which
the assertion of the identity of the argument in focus is expressed by an
identificatory predicate and the presupposition is placed in a subordinate
relative clause. The constructions with copula movement such as brònuxile xíla xabúša} are not cleft sentences since the presupposition is not in a
relative clause and, moreover, the copula agrees with the subject, even if
this is the asserted argument, e.g. ""àn6n mú°y6lle} ‘I have brought it’ (= It
was me who has brought it). The attachment of the copula to the focused
argument and the placement of the nuclear stress on this argument are,
nevertheless, properties of the predicate of a copula clause. It may be
said, therefore, that the construction possesses some properties of a cleft
sentence but does not have all the components of its structure.
Clauses exhibiting leftward movement of the copula may have two foci
of contrast, in which case the subject is given preference for the attachment of the enclitic, e.g.
(9)""àtit °í°a kêsli.} lán ""àna-""6°ya kêsl6x.} ‘You came to me. I did not come
to you.’ (A4:4)
(10) yà-baxta} lan-""àna ""è°ya dmíxa gu-šwì°6x.} ""àtit °í°a dmíxta gu-šwì°i.}
‘Woman, I have not come to sleep in your bed. You have come to
sleep in my bed.’ (A26:4)The presuppositional background of these constructions would have two
unknown variables, e.g. ‘x came to y’ and the speaker is asserting the
identity of both of these.
The intention of the new information focus may be to express exclusivity, e.g.
(11) har-""àtit plíxa} ‘Only you have worked.’ (A21:15)
(12) kúlla hóla q†ìle.} bas-àn6n šrí†a.} ‘They have all been killed. Only I
have escaped.’ (B19:8)
The presuppositional background of these examples would be ‘x has
worked’ and ‘x has escaped’ respectively.","[715, 716, 717, 718]"

kill me.’ (B9:4)
The construction is used as an intensifier to express the extensive or farreaching nature of the action, e.g.
(12) ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya} ‘I have absolutely gone with it! (i.e. I am
finished!)’ (A14:25)
(13) ma†réwa ma†róye x5làna.} ‘He was riding hard.’ (A8:39)
In (14) it is used to express the slow drawing out of the action:
(14) šqílta réše mattóye mtút6lle l-9ra.} ‘She took his head and slowly put it
on the ground.’ (A13:12)
In (15) and (16) the cognate infinitive is used to give prominence to the
descriptive content of the action of the verb:
(15) kút-xa y-amrèxxe yá'ni ""6n-íle náša spày,} ""ó-yoma basímta t-óya šêmša.}
xàðexi.} ""ó-yoma hàtxa yá'ni} y-amrèxla màra.} ‘We would say to each

We were having fun. It was like that on that day, we would just
say such things (but not really mean it).’ (B5:150–151)
(16) ""áy lˆwa zwána zwán6lla.} ‘They were not really buying it.’ (B15:68)732chapter fifteenIn (17) the construction is used to make a forceful assertion to dispel the
doubt of a question posed by the interlocutor:
(17) zaqrituwa? zqára ""i-zaqrèxwa ""àxni,} hè.} ‘Did you knit? We indeed used
to knit, yes.’ (B10:46)
In the foregoing examples the cognate infinitive is the same stem as the
finite verb. In (18), by contrast, a stem I infinitive is combined with a stem
II verb. The stem II verb (m-brz ‘to dry’) is transitive whereas the stem I
form (brz I ‘to become dry’) is intransitive. The infinitive, therefore, does
not simply intensify the verb but expresses a telic outcome ‘they dry the
rice so that it becomes dry’, i.e. ‘they dried the rice out’:
(18) bar-hád6x rèzza mbárzi bràza.} masqíwale gàre,} masqíwa gàr-t bˆ°a.}
mpa°ˆwale.} barèzwa tàza.} ‘After that they dry the rice out. They
would take it up to the roof, take it up to the roof of the house.
They spread it out. It became thoroughly dry.’ (B5:88)
15.5.4. Purpose
On some occasions an infinitive is used to extend the description of an
action in a preceding clause by denoting the purpose of the action rather
than an action that actually takes place during its time interval. This is
particularly common after verbs expressing movement, taking and fetching, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)(6)Zíne zílla dwáq6lla prìxla.} ‘Zine went to grab it, (but) it flew off.’
(A25:72)
y-azíwa baxtá°a yàda.} ‘The women would go to weed.’ (B5:78)
kùt-yum} ßaléwa gàw‰a} l-šùqa} msawòqe.} ‘Every day the man would
go down to the market to do shopping.’ (A22:1)
""áp-""aw qím5le šqíl6lle tàwra} ßêly5le} mzabòn6lle.} ‘So, he took the ox
and went down to sell it.’ (A22:2)
mèra lá-dri x7l6t gànux.} ""ána °í°6n mpal†ánnux m-gu-sêj6n.} mère lát-°i°a
""ána mpaló†6lli m-gu-sêj6n.} °í°6t šqála ""áyya róxi m6n-gu-gàni.} ‘She said
“Do not struggle. I have come to bring you out of the prison.”
He said “You have not come to bring me out of the prison. You
have come to take my spirit from me.” ’ (A26:82)
""áy kút-yom mpal†áwala m>‰òy6lla.} ‘She took them out every day to
pasture them.’ (A34:20)the syntax of verbs733(7) ""ána šqìl6nne} ""áwwa qa†íya mxáya ""èlle dìye.} ‘I took this stick to strike at
it.’ (A29:23)
15.5.5. Complement of Verbs
The infinitive is used in the complement of verbs of perception, in which
it expresses the action of the referent that is perceived. The perceived
referent may be placed directly after the verb or is introduced by the
presentative particle ""ina, e.g.
(1) xzélux xa-náša °àya.} ‘You saw a man coming.’ (A22:22)
(2) wírre k6slèy} xírre mtúle bàla} kút-xa m6nnèy} réše m†áya l-†ùra.} ‘When he
went in to meet them, he looked and noticed that the head of each
of them reached the (top of ) the mountain.’ (A39:5)
(3) qím5le plì†a} xèzya ""ína b7°6t Qára Té≥din qàða.} ‘He went out and saw
that the house of Qara Te≥din was burning.’ (A26:53)
Object agreement pronouns on the verb, as in (4), indicate that the
perceived item is raised into the matrix clause when there is no ""ina
particle:
(4) là hummènne.} ha-t-xazèla} bráta °àya.} ‘He did not believe it, until he
saw the girl coming.’ (A26:79)
The verb of perception may be omitted with only the presentative particle
being used, e.g.
(5) mátti bála gu-yàma,} ""ìna} ""a-súst6t yamà°a} nabòl6lla} ’6lk9ze.} ‘They looked
at the sea and saw the mare of the seas taking away ’6lk>ze.’
(A12:34)
The infinitive is also used as the complement of various other verbs
including those having the sense of ‘beginning’, ‘learning’, ‘being busy’
and the irregular verb kyaza ‘to try’, e.g.
(6) šúryela m†awóle b-š6tr6njàne.} ‘They started to play chess.’ (A26:63)
(7) šurèla} jnàna} ""u-bxàya} ""u-mßawóre †la-xóna-w Bakùrko.} ‘She began to
lament, weep and curse her brother and Bakurko.’ (A26:83)
(8) šuréle là-draya bála l-s6tr6njàne.} šuréle gašòqe} b-Zìne.} ‘He began not to
pay attention to the chess. He began to look at Zine.’ (A26:66)734chapter fifteen(9)""u-táwra píšle mangóle ""áxxa l-tàmma.} ‘The ox began to limp back and
forth.’ (A22:3)
(10) píšt5la mtanóye ða-qêßß6t} †la-qà†u.} ‘She started to tell a story to the
cat.’ (A14:2)
(11) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} ‘They began to cultivate apples.’ (B5:75)
(12) ""áy hár-lipla dmàxa} ""u-xàla.} ‘She learnt only how to sleep and to
eat.’ (A21:1)
(13) m-táma hòd6x} kúlla ""an-""árba yàrxe,} xámša yàrxe,} y-áw5 náše blíge mj>mòye,}
mj>móye qa-sêtwa.} ‘From this time onwards, throughout four or
five months, people are busy gathering, gathering for winter.’
(B5:107)
(14) kízle qràya.} ‘He tried calling.’ (A48:5)
(15) kízle mxàya} goyá°6t sùsa,} súsa la-jwìjle.} ‘He tried to strike the sides
of the horse, but the horse did not move.’ (A28:33)
(16) kazíwa prám6lla har-pal†ìwa.} ‘They tried to cut them down, but they
kept growing up.’ (A38:15)
Past forms of the verb šry II ‘to begin’ may also be followed by a finite
verb rather than an infinitive, e.g.
(17) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
(A25:11)
(18) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
(19) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)
(20) šuréle ta-t-""àx6l.} ‘He began to eat’ (A21:12)
15.5.6. Complement of a Noun
On some occasions the infinitive is the complement of a noun, e.g.
(1)""í°wa rába ""urxá°a m†awòle.} ‘There were many ways to play.’ (B15:5)15.5.7. Complement of an Adjective
(1)
(2)
(3)""áti mùdit har-blíga †lába m-alàha} ta-t-yawêllux.} ‘Why are always busy
asking God to give (things) to you.’ (A3:3)
l7la senáyi xzày6lle.} ‘It is not easy to see him.’
zám6tila wàð6lle.} ‘It is difficult to do it.’the syntax of verbs73515.5.8. Syntactic Position of a Nominal
The infinitive is attested in various syntactic positions that are normally
occupied by nominals. These include:
(i) The Subject of a Clause
(1) qráya zàm6t-ila.} ‘Reading is difficult.’
(2) mdaróye modìla?} ‘What is winnowing?’ (B5:97)
(3) ""á°ela myá°a ""up-""ày.} ‘Death comes upon also her.’ (A26:89)
(ii) The Complement of a Naming Expression, e.g.
(1) ""áwwa y-amrèxxe wáða h5rìke.} ‘We call this “making soft mud beds.” ’
(B5:76)
(2) y-amrèxxe mxáya bè""e.} yá'ni šmá†a bé""e xa-d-o-xˆna,} twàra.} ‘We call this
“striking eggs,” that is knocking eggs together and breaking them.’
(B5:58)
(iii) The Complement of a Preposition
(1) pláxa biš-spáyila m6n-dmàxa.} ‘Working is better than sleeping.’
(2) xa-béna xèzya ""è°y5le xa-xùwwe} ""ax-pràxa.} ‘Then he saw a snake come,
as if flying.’ (A14:31)
(3) máme díye t-wéwa max-q†àl6lle.} ‘His uncle who had almost killed him.’
(A25:70)
(4) ""ána mj>móye qˆse,} déwe blíge b-xmáre xàla.} ‘While I was collecting
wood, wolves were busy eating the asses.’ (A23:35)
(iv) The Complement of a Nominal in Annexation
(1) jawètt6t práma qˆse} ‘a chopper for cutting wood’ (A26:91)
(v) The Complement of the Existential Particle
(1) ""ína gu-d-5-dàna} har-""í° rqàða-w} zmàra-w} m5°óye štˆ°a,} ""àraq-u} xumlàna.}
‘At that time there is constantly dancing, singing, serving of drinks,
arak, and jollity.’ (B5:71)736chapter fifteenAlthough the infinitive in these constructions is in a syntactic slot appropriate for a nominal, the infinitive is still treated like a verb with regard
to its own internal complemetation. This is seen in (ii1), (ii2) and (iv1),
where the objects of the infinitives are juxtaposed (wáða h5rìke ‘making
soft mud beds’, mxáya bè""e ‘striking eggs’, šmá†a bé""e ‘knocking eggs’, práma
qˆse ‘cutting wood’) rather than the infinitive being connected to it by a
nominal annexation with the particle D. In (iii4), furthermore, the object
is fronted before the infinitive (b-xmáre xàla). Note also that when the infinitive functions as the subject of a clause, it is often construed as feminine
in gender (i1–2).
15.6. The Verbal Noun
The verbal noun, which is formed by adding the feminine ending to the
infinitive, in principle denotes a single occurrence of an activity (§10.5.2.2.)
and so is inherently perfective in aspect. It may also be used to refer to
an iterative activity by denoting a single representative occurrence of this
iterated situation.
15.6.1. The Nominal Nature of the Verbal Noun
The verbal noun is treated syntactically in most respects like other nouns.
It may be used in a clause in positions that are appropriate for nouns, such
as subject position (1–2) or the complement of a preposition (3–5):
(1) dán6t plí†la qyàmta.} šahárta qa-t-qyàmta pál†a.} ‘The time when the
resurrection has come. They keep vigil until the resurrection comes
out.’ (B5:54)
(2) bár parqáwa qyàmta.} ‘After the resurrection (ceremony) had finished . . .’
(B5:56)
(3) ""u-""áyya gu-dyà‰ta} mòdi wídla?} ‘What did she do on her return?’
(A19:4)
(4) ""6n-b>yèxwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6nile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
(5) mhày6rri} b6d-taxmàntux.} ‘Help me with your thought (on this matter).’
(A21:2)
A nominal denoting the subject or object participant of the activity
expressed by the verbal noun must be combined with the verbal nounthe syntax of verbs737by nominal annexation. This differs from infinitives, which are treated as
verbs in this respect and have their participants juxtaposed. Examples:
(i) Subject
(1) qyámt6t màran} ‘the resurrection of our Lord’ (B5:55)
(2) gu-práqt6t ""aßêrta,} bar-prìqla,} m5°7wa juwàla.} ‘At the end of the evening,
after they finished, they would bring a sack.’ (B5:86)
(3) b-zòr-áa¬e} †la-mapláxt6t bˆ°a.} ‘It is scarcely enough for the household
to use.’ (B5:215)
(ii) Object
(1) xyápt6t xêtna} ‘the washing of the groom’ (B15:74)
(2) zrét6t rêzza} ‘the cultivating of rice’ (B5:76)
(3) palá††6t ""9raq} ‘the production of arak’ (B5:12)
(4) mtaráßt6t xèlya ‘the preparation of milk’ (B5:173)
(5) ""u-qaÄèxwa yóma qamáy6t ""èða,} baráxt6t ""éða xa-d-o-xèna.} ‘We would
spend the first day of the festival offering festival blessings to one
another.’ (B15:8)
15.6.2. Cognate Verbal Nouns
Verbal nouns are used with their cognate verbs in various contexts. It is
found in anaphoric expressions such as those in (1) and (2), which express
a perfective and iterative activity respectively:
(1) ""u-píš5le gu-d-5-pyàšta} há-t-ila °í°a ""ámte dìye.} ‘He remained in that
situation until his aunt came.’ (A23:7)
(2) ""u-""an-baxtà°a} kapšìwale,} napßíwale gu-d-a-npàßta} ""u-mattíwale l-qóma bá°6r
xàßey.} ‘The women would gather it and shake it with the shaking
( just mentioned) and put it into a pile behind their back.’ (B5:85)
Similar anaphoric constructions are used in which the finite verb occurs
in a preceding clause, e.g.
(3) mèra qú ßli-xzì!} . . . gu-d-7 ßl5°èy} qá†u wìrt5la.} ‘She said “Go down
and see!” While they were coming down (like this), a cat came in.’
(A4:52–53)738chapter fifteenA verbal noun is used with a cognate finite verb to express the intensity
of a single perfective action, e.g.
(4) °éle tálga xa-°ˆ°a.} ‘Snow came with a (great) coming’ (i.e. it snowed
heavily).’ (A25:41)
The use of a cognate verbal noun can be used to give additional morphological coding to a perfective event to mark a boundary in the discourse. This is the case with (5), in which the clause in question marks a
an episodic boundary:
(5) qlábta díya qlìbla} ""u-kúlle bêrya} y-amrèxxe xa-kerábso ‘She returned her
return (= When she returned) and it had all grown into (the plant)
we call kerabso.’ (A34:17)
15.6.3. The Verbal Noun Combined with the Verb ‘to be’
On some occasions the verbal noun is combined with the verb ‘to be’
following the model of compound verbal forms with the infinitive. This
construction expresses an iterative action, by presenting one representative
occurrence of the action. The compound infinitive construction can express
the same iterative sense (§15.4.2.4.). Examples from the text corpus:
(1) hár mkapášt6t kisyá°6t dàwela tóto.} ‘The old woman is all the time collecting bags of gold.’ (A4:22)
(2) rqàðt5la-w} xálta-w štˆ°5la.} ‘They are dancing, eating and drinking.’
(A14:46)
(3) warwàrt5la-w} ‘It (the bear) roars.’ (A27:29)
(4) maplàšt5w6lley} yèn mattèxwaley gu-ßàwle.} ‘They would knock them
together or we would put them in shoes.’ (B15:5)
(5) ""6n-t-áwe jwàjta,} b-šàx6n.} ‘If he moves (on one occasion), he warms
up.’ (B11:16)
Note that the verbal noun in (4) maplàšt5w6lley expresses the pronominal
object with an ""6ll- phrase.
In (6) a verbal noun construction is juxtaposed with an infinitive construction. The former can be interpreted as expressing the iterated single
events of the animal’s roaring and the latter as denoting a continuous
activity of singing:the syntax of verbs
(6)739""ay-wàðt5la} n>ra-n8ra dìya} ""u-""áw zmàr5le bíya.} ‘She is giving off her
roar and he is singing along with her.’ (A27:14)In (7), where the subject in the English translation is non-volitional, the
copula takes the verbal noun as its grammatical subject:
(7)qarqárte dìyela} ‘He made a squeaking noise (literally: there is his
squeaking).’ (A30:9)In (8) the form jnanya°a can be interpreted as the plural of the verbal noun
jnanta and, therefore, expresses a plurality of individual actions:
(8)qímela ""ê°ye.} ""7-bena ""áxxa kúlla jnanyà°5la.} ""7-ga zmár5la b-tábut dìye.}
‘They came and there they all lamented and sang (dirges) over his
coffin.’ (A26:83)
15.7. The Imperative FormIn most cases the imperative form is used perfectively to command the
performance of a single delimited action with a clear start and endpoint,
e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)prúmu rèše!} ‘Cut off his head!’ (A24:31)
hallúle ""álpa dàwe!} ‘Give him a thousand gold pieces!’ (A1:14)
šqúlla yalêx°a!} ‘Take the scarf !’ (A4:18)
diya-m7°u júlli malušùla!} ‘Now bring my clothes and put them on
(me)!’ (A4:20)
wúð ða-spayú°a mênni!} ‘Do me a favour!’ (A7:17)
háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a.} ‘Come Karim, go down into
this conduit!’ (A14:16)Prohibitions may be expressed by negating an imperative form by the
negative particle la. If this particle is combined with the verb in a stress
group it typically takes the stress, e.g.
(7) lá-wuð qàla!} ‘Do not make a noise!’ (A30:44)
(8) lá-mur hàtxa!} ‘Do not say that!’ (A26:52)
(9) bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)
(10) là maštóla míya} ‘Do not give them water to drink!’ (A25:9)740chapter fifteenOn some occasions the imperative is used to command or prohibit a less
clearly delimited action. In (11) and (12), for example, the imperatives
‘work!’ and ‘search!’ respectively clearly command the inception of the
action but do not necessarily imply an endpoint. In (13) the actions commanded by the imperatives are most easily interpreted as iterative. The
speaker is referring to the annual custom of Kurds to bring sheep into
the village during transhumance and intends his command to apply to
all future years.
(11) xuš-plùx6n!} ta-mú-t ba†íla tíwa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Go and work! Why are you
sitting idly in the house?’ (A39:1)
(12) †ó-l5xu xa-šúla ta-t-x8yitu bìye!} ‘Search for a job for yourselves by
which you may make a living!’ (A30:1)
(13) lá-masqu l-gár6t ""ùmra!} m-gu-gár6t ""úmra hóla náblula t>máha rê˙qa!}
†la-mótu m5°óy6lla gár6t ""ùmra?} ‘Don’t take them onto the roof. Take
them far away from the roof of the church. Why do you bring
them on the roof of the church?’ (B18:7)
In (14) and (15) the imperatives are negated by the particle bassa ‘enough!’
and command the end of an activity that is already in progress without
any implied starting point:
(14) bássa bxˆg6n} bássa wuð-tàzi.} ‘Do not weep any more! Do not mourn
any more!’ (A26:88)
(15) bássa ští ""u-rwì!} ‘Don’t drink any more and get any more drunk!’
On numerous occasions the imperative is preceded by the particle of
immediacy d6-/de-. Most attested examples are positive commands, e.g.
(16) d6-šqúl ""anna-zùze!} ‘Take these coins!’ (A1:27)
(17) d6-šùqla!} ‘Leave it!’ (A5:7)
(18) de-mùrri!} ‘Tell me!’ (A4:26)
(19) de-wúr gu-d-áwwa gùrba!} ‘Go into this torso!’ (A14:67)
The particle may be placed before an adverb of immediate time reference, such as ‘today’ in (20):
(20) de-""êdyo,} qu-p7g6n kàde!} ‘Today, get up and bake kade cakes!’
(A30:41)the syntax of verbs741In (21) the particle is placed before a 2nd person pronoun:
(21) d6-""áti xùš!} ‘You go!’ (A39:1)
As has been discussed in §15.1.1.5., also the 2nd person of the qa†6l form
can be used deontically to express commands or prohibitions. This may
be used perfectively to express single delimited actions, e.g.
(22) súsux b8ye t-kàle.} là-šoq6t t-kále.} máx6t ""èlle díye ta-t-""ás6q pày6dle ""o-†úra.}
‘Your horse will want to stop. Do not let him stop. Strike him so
that he will go up and cross over that mountain.’ (A24:11)
(23) xazètla t6rtè bná°a} t-á°i m7°i qàhwa.} là-šaql6tle qáhwa mènna.} maxètle
s7pux ""6l-qðalèy} p5rmêtle rešéy.} ‘You will see two girls, who will
come and bring coffee. Do not accept the coffee from them. You
should strike your sword into their neck and cut off their head.’
(A24:13)
(24) ""áz6t táwrux p5rmêtle.} ‘You should go and slaughter your ox.’
(A7:2)
It may also be used imperfectively to express general commands or prohibitions that are not delimited to a single action, e.g.
(25) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše!} ‘This is what you should do to people!’ (A22:47)
(26) là-qabl6t} là b6‰-náša t-áw6r gáwa} ""u-là h7w6n.} ‘Don’t allow any person
or animal to enter it.’ (A23:18)
(27) là maßí°6t} ""àni} sa†anyà°5la} ‘Don’t listen (to such things), they are
little demons.’ (A26:11)
The distinction between the imperative form and the deontic qa†6l form,
therefore, is not primarily one of aspect, although this may have some
bearing on the choice between the two. The main factor is rather the
communicative profile of the command. In principle a speaker uses the
imperative when he wishes to give the command a high degree of salience.
The deontic qa†6l form is used when it has a lesser degree of salience.
Various features contribute to this salience. One feature is immediacy. All
other things being equal, an imperative expresses the will of the speaker
for an action to be performed closer to the present moment than the qa†6l
form. Consider, for example, the pair of constructions (28) and (29), both
of which are perfective in aspect. In (28) the speaker invites the addressee742chapter fifteento come immediately and join him swimming. In (29) the request relates
to an action of coming at a point further in the future:
(28) ""ána hon-sxáya gàwa.} b8y6t t-á°y6t sàxy6t?} d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘I am swimming in it. Do you want to swim? Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
(29) yóm6t †¬à°a,} ""á°6t k6slˆni.} ‘In three days time come to us.’ (A22:17)
It is relevant to note that the particle of immediacy d6-/de-, which is
commonly used with imperatives but only sporadically with deontic qa†6l,
is likely to be related etymologically to the adverbial diya ‘now’. In some
NENA dialects it is used in progressive contructions that express actions
that are taking place at the present moment (e.g. C. Ankawa d6-k-šat6n ‘I
am drinking’).
As we have seen in (11) and (12), the action commanded by an imperative may extend indefinitely into the future. In (14) the action has no
definite starting point. The relevant feature in all these cases is that the
speaker commands the action to begin or end immediately.
The use of the imperative to express the command of iterative actions
cannot be motivated by temporal immediacy. The salience of the command
arises from its high degree of force, which is greater than in corresponding
iterative deontic expressions with qa†6l forms such as (30):
(30) kút-yom pál†6t ""u-xàðr6t,} ""áß6rta ""á°6t bˆ°a.} ‘Every day go out and wander about and then in the evening come back home.’ (A14:62)
Another feature that contributes to salience appears to be the positiveness
of the command. All other things being equal, there is a greater tendency
to use the deontic qa†6l form with a negative command than with a positive one, as reflected in (31) and (32), in which positive commands and
prohibitions with perfective aspect referring to immediate actions are
used side by side:
(31) mèra hàyyo,} hàyyo!} madam-t-íw6t ""àti,} hàyyo!} là-""az6t.} ‘Come, come.
Since it is you, come, don’t go!’ (A24:36)
(32) ""áti là pálx6t.} ""áti tù.} ""àna pálx6n.} ‘Don’t you work. You sit down. I
shall work.’ (A21:23)
Indeed, in some NENA dialects, such as C. Qaraqosh, negative commands can only be expressed by negating the qa†6l form (cf. Khan 2002:
351). In C. Barwar, as in many other NENA dialects, negation has beenthe syntax of verbs743extended to imperative forms, but the distribution of negated commands
is still less than that of positive commands on account of the inherently
lower degree of salience of a negated command. The fact that the particle
d6-/de-, which gives added salience to a command, is largely restricted
to positive commands may also be a reflection of this inherently lower
salience of negated commands.
All the uses of the imperative described above can be reconciled with
the claim that the form is perfective. As already remarked, cases such as
(11), (12) and (14) can be regarded as having an ingressive or terminative sense, which are features exhibited by other perfective forms. The
occurrence of the imperative in iterative expressions can be explained as
being the use of a perfective form appropriate to command an individual
occurrence of the iterated action to command, by implication, the iterated action as a whole. It is relevant to note that in (13) the speaker uses
in an adjacent clause the compound infinitive construction to refer to an
iterative action (†la-mótu m5°óy6lla gár6t ""ùmra?} ‘Why do you bring them
on the roof of the church?’). As we have seen (§15.4.2.4.), the use of the
infinitive construction to express an iterative action is an extension of its
use to express a perfective narrative present. It can be said that the basic
perfectivity of the form, which gives the commanded action delimited
boundaries, results in its salience and it is this perfectivity that gives the
sense of greater force in the command. The deontic qa†6l form, on the
other hand, may express either perfective or imperfective aspect. We may
summarize the features contributing to the salience in imperative forms in
the scales below, in which the symbol > should be read as ‘more salient
than’. All other things being equal, a command with the features on the
lefthand side of the scales would be more likely to be expressed by an
imperative than those with the features on the righthand side:
Perfective
Positive
Immediate>
>
>Imperfective
Negative
Non-immediateThe imperative may be extended by a variety of suffixes (§8.6.5.). Informants feel that these add additional force to the command like the prefixed
particle d6-/de-. In the text corpus they are attested only with positive commands, which is likely to be a reflection of the inherently lower salience of
the negative commands. Another factor that determines the distribution
of the imperative forms with added suffixes is their position within a section of discourse. When there are two or more imperatives in a sequence,744chapter fifteenforms with added suffixes tend to be placed at the end of the sequence.
The heavy morphological coding of the forms is used in such contexts to
mark a final boundary of a discourse unit. The sequence may consist of
two or more different imperatives in a closely knit unit as in (33–35) or
the repetition of the same imperative as in (36) and (37), e.g.
(33) dú‰u sógena k6s-babàxu.} ‘Return, go to your father.’ (A14:85)
(34) xuš-plùx6n!} ‘Go and work!’ (A39:1)
(35) qu-p7g6n kàde} ‘Get up and bake kade cakes.’ (A30:41)
(36) sí-mur ta-pèll6n waz‰r} múrgena málka °èle.} ‘Go and say to the minister
so-and-so, say the king has come back.’ (A4:33)
(37) xùl!} dàn5la.} qìrra.} xùlena!} ‘Eat! It is time. It has got cold. Eat!’
(B5:34)
In a few cases the imperative is used in narrative as a substitute for a
perfective narrative verbal form. These are addressed to the person
performing the action and are typically used when there is a transition
between spatial locations that involves a verb of movement. The clause
containing the imperative may open with a 3rd person subject pronoun
as in (38) and (39):
(38) qímt5la zìlta,} mu°7°6lla qußárta dìya.} ""a-zórta muttá°6lla gu-d-7 qußárt6t
šwàwe} ""u-nubàlt6lla.} hadìya,} ""áw qu-šqúlla qußàrta-w} sí be-šwàwux.}
šláma-ll5xu šwàwe.} ‘She went and brought her cooking pot. She put
the small one in the cooking pot of the neighbours and took it (to
her husband). Now, he—get up and take the cooking pot and go
to the house of your neighbour! “Greeings to you neighbours.” ’
(A5:4)
(39) qáy6m yawèlle ""álpa dáwe xène.} ""áw xá-reša m-táma qú-si l-bˆ°a.} ""áp
""an-tre-""álpe dáwe xéne mˆ°ila.} ""u-háyyo šláma-llux xóni xùwwe!} ‘He
gives him another thousand gold pieces. He—directly from there
get up and go home. Bring back also those two thousand pieces
of gold and come back “Greetings my brother snake! Peace and
blessings!” ’ (A1:19–20)
Example (40) illustrates the use of an imperative for another type of narrative strategy. The negated imperative of the verb to say lá-mur ‘Do not
say!’, which is presumably addressed to the hearer of the narrative, has
the function of drawing special attention to what follows.","[769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779, 780, 781, 782, 783]"

"For the use of ma in conjoining constructions see §14.11.
14.9.14. ""5ni
This may be used as an interrogative modifier of a noun in the sense of
‘which’, e.g.
(1)
(2)""7ni báxt5la mubrˆ°a?} ‘Which woman has given birth?’ (A25:6)
ga-l7ð6x ""5kˆla,} b-7ni dùk°5la.} ‘But we do not know where she is, in
which place she is.’ (A26:18)the syntax of nominals
(3)551ga-""7ni Zìne} ""áxni lˆð6x.} ‘Now, which Zine we do not know.’
(A26:61)It may be separated from its head by intervening material, in which case
it is linked to the noun by the annexation particle D, e.g.
(4)""7ni ""ítl5xu t-náše t-máßi mšáw°i mênna.} ‘What people do you have
who can talk with her?’ (A4:13)In (5) the particle is placed after the noun and is followed by a prepositional
phrase that restricts the scope of the question to a previously mentioned
known set of items:
(5)pènxa ""7ni m6nnˆle?} ‘Which of the (types of) grind wheel is it? (literally: a grind wheel which of them is it?)’ (B5:92)It is more frequently encountered in the text corpus as an independent
interrogative with the sense of ‘who’, e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""ˆnile?} ‘Who is he?’ (A2:7)
""ˆni híwle-ll6x?} ‘Who gave it to you?’ (A4:19)
""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
""7ni b-záw6n tàwra?} ‘Who will buy an ox?’ (A22:2)This usage no doubt developed from questions concerning members of
a set such as:
(10) ""7ni m6nn7xu t-àz6l?} ‘Which of you will go?’ (A30:1)
(11) múr ""ˆni-m6nn6n} biš-šapìrt5la.} ‘Say which of us is the most beautiful.’
(A25:17)
14.9.15. hatxa
This word may be used as an anaphoric determiner before a singular or
plural noun in the sense of ‘such a’, ‘such’, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)bróni lá-wuð hátxa mêndi.} ‘My son, do not do such a thing.’ (A14:6)
lì° hatxa-mèndi.} ‘There is not such a thing.’ (A25:69)

hátxa p6lxána pàlxeti?} ‘Do you do such work as this?’ (A23:32)
málka krìble} bud-hàtxa m6ndiyáne.} ‘The king became angry about
such things.’ (A25:8)It may be used independently of a head noun as a subject or object argument in a clause, e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)hátxa la-hàwya.} ‘Such a thing should not be.’ (A21:32)
si-hátxa múrg6n †la-màlka.} ‘Go, say thus to the king.’ (A17:30)
qa-mòt hátxa wáða bíyi?} ‘Why are you doing this to me?’ (A25:42)It can take a nominal plural ending, e.g.
(9)""ána g8r6g ""ámr6n hatxàne.} ‘I must tell such things.’ (A39:7)It is used predicatively, e.g.
(10) hàtx5la qèßß6t.} ‘The story is this.’ (A13:5)
(11) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is the town like this?’ (A4:31)
The particle may function as a modifier of adjectives, e.g.
(12) ""íman t-íle xêzy6lla,} hátxa š6†ránta-w šapìrta,} ""ay-ßrìxla.} ‘When he saw
her, so beautiful and good-looking, she screamed.’ (A4:4)
(13) ""u-parošyá°a hátxa glòle} ‘pebbles, round like this’ (A23:17)
(14) hátxa faqìra} ‘so poor’ (A40:4)
It is frequently used adverbially, e.g.
(15) mjun6gníla hàtxa.} ‘She shook them like this.’ (A4:15)
(16) dwíq6lla hátxa gu-""íðe dìye.} ‘He took her like this in his hand.’
(A13:25)
(17) šišále gáne hàtxa.} ‘He rocked himself like.’ (A31:7)
14.9.16. hod6x
This is occasionally used as a deictic modifier of a nominal with the sense
of ‘yonder’, e.g.
(1) m-támma hód6x †ùra ""á°‰6 d-ánna dèwele.} ‘From here to yonder mountain
is the land of the wolves.’ (A14:48)the syntax of nominals553It is combined with a demonstrative pronoun in expressions such as
l-ay-gōt-hòd6x t-šaqí°a} ‘on the farther side of the channel’ (A9:1). It is more
commonly used as an adverbial meaning ‘beyond, further’, e.g.
(2) m-táma hód6x t-áz6t má†6t xa-nèra.} ‘Go onwards from there and you
will reach a river.’ (A14:50)
It is often combined with biš, e.g. xá‘‘a xéna biš-hód6x ‘a little further on’
(A7:22). On some occasions it has temporal rather than spatial reference,
e.g.
(3) m-táma hòd6x} ""áxtu ""u-g yanˆxu.} ‘From then onwards you are by yourselves.’ (A8:27)
14.9.17. ‘u
This is used as a negative determiner in the sense of ‘not any.’ The predicate of the clause in which it occurs is itself always negative, e.g.
(1) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘and for you I have not left anything.’
(A2:11)
(2) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured, nothing is the matter with
me.’ (A4:20)
(3) ta-t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘so that nothing will happen to it.’
(A7:9)
(4) ‘ù p6lxána la-pálx6t ""áti.} ‘You shall do no work.’ (A23:32)
(5) hon-dèry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pal6†.} ‘I have put him
in a deep hole and he will never be able to come out.’ (A22:41)
The negation can be reinforced by prefixing the particles la and har, e.g.
(6) la-har-‘u-dúk°a lì°wa.} ‘She was nowhere at all (to be found).’
(A27:26)
14.9.18. hi‘
The particle hi‘ is used with the same function as ‘u by some speakers,
e.g. hi‘-nàša} ‘nobody’ (A8:2). It may be combined with the indefinite
article, e.g.","[589, 590, 591, 592]"
"the syntax of verbs701(i) ‘to become’
When used with an ascriptive or identificatory predicate, it has an ingressive sense of ‘becoming’, expressing a present resultative state, e.g.
(1) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} záwna wíy5le t-šlàma.} ‘You
have not become a good man and brought these coins. The time
has become one of peace.’ (A1:26)
(2) bálki qam-dána háwa wíye xèzme m-©ðàðe.} ‘Perhaps beforehand they
have become relatives of one another.’ (B5:5)
(3) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
word) †alana means ‘shady’, since when the sun would strike the
mountains, they became like that.’ (B3:2)
Note that in (3) the resultative form is used in an apodosis of a temporal
sentence that contains a habitual verb in the first clause (maxyàwa). The
resultative must have a distributive sense, i.e. on each occasion when
the sun struck the mountains, they became like that. Furthermore, since
the resultative expresses a state, it cannot be interpreted as a sequential
event but rather as an temporally overlapping situation (literally: ‘At the
time when the sun struck the mountains, they have become like that’).
(ii) Existential Function
The form may be used to express the coming into existence of the subject.
When the subject is inanimate, the verb has the sense of ‘happening’,
e.g.
(1) ""áp-""ayya p-aqènna ""êllux,} sab-wít5la b-réši ""up-àyya.} ‘I shall tell you also
about this, since this also happened to me.’ (B15:85)
(2) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
(B5:163)
(3) hadíya mtán6x xa-qêßß6t} t-íla wíta gu-ˇiyàre} qám-plaša qamàya.} ‘Now
we’ll tell a story that happened in ˇiyare before the First World
War.’ (B17:1)
(4) ""ˆ-ga} ""ánna m6ndiyáne wìyela.} ‘Those things happened at that time.’
(A19:9)
In (1) and (2) the events in question took place at a time that is remote
from the present, but they are presented from the perspective of the
speaker at the present moment. They can be interpreted as ‘experiential
perfects’, i.e. events that are part of the speaker’s life experience or at702chapter fifteenleast events that he has heard about in his life. Examples (3) and (4) are
narrative uses of the resultative construction that are equivalent in function to the q†ille form (§15.4.1.3.).
When the subject of the verb is animate, it has the sense of ‘to be
born’, e.g.
(5) šet6-†è¬¬6° wìt5la} S6ttìye.} ‘In the third year S6ttiye was born.’ (A25:25)
(6) ""ím6 t-íla wíta S6ttìye,} ""áy biš-xám°5la m-kùlla.} ‘When S6ttiye was born,
she was the most beautiful of all.’ (A25:26)
(7) b-ay-dána lànwa wí°a.} ‘At that time I was not born.’ (B10:45)
(iii) Temporal Expressions
In narratives, the construction sometimes takes a nominal denoting a period
of time as its subject in clauses that set the temporal frame for what follows. The subject nominals are placed after the verbal form, e.g.
(1) wíy5le yóm6t †¬à°a} ""áwwa f†ìr5le} ""u-plì†5le.} ‘(When) the third day came,
he had breakfast and went out.’ (A22:24)
(2) wít5la qèdamta,} jènne ""ê°yela,} šqìl6lla Zíne} nùbl6lla Jazíra Bóta.} ‘In the
morning, the jinn came and took Zine, took her away to Jazira
Bota.’ (A26:8)
(3) wít5la qedámta sá""6t ""árpa b-lˆle,} ‰ìš5le} màlka.} ‘(When) the morning
came, four o’clock in the morning, the king woke up.’ (A17:27)
(4) wít5la dán6t mabròye,} tèrw6°na mubrèla} hàr ""o-yóma.} ‘(When) the time of
giving birth came, they both gave birth on the same day.’ (A25:4)
(5) wít5la dàna,} mìßela ""èrbe,} pá‰e m6n-y6mma°èy,} mère . . . } ‘(When) the season
came and the sheep sucked, the lambs sucked from their mothers,
he said . . .’ (A25:26)
As has been discussed in §15.4.1.3., the resultative form can be used in
narrative with the function of a preterite rather than a present perfect.
Judging by cases such as (4) above, however, where the following clause
is in the q†ille form, it would appear that the resultative forms wiy5le and
wit5la here have their basic function of expressing a resultant state rather
than an event, i.e. the state against the background of which the event
described in what follows took place. In (1)–(5) the verbs can be interpreted
as existential forms of hwy, correponding to the previous category (‘the
third day happened’). The gender agreement between the initial verbthe syntax of verbs703form and the following temporal noun demonstrates that the noun is the
grammatical subject.
Various examples are attested that exhibit a development of the aforementioned construction, whereby the resultative of the verb hwy is used
before an adverbial prepositional phrase or an adverbial clause, which
cannot function as the grammatical subject. In such cases the verb has
a 3fs. form, which must be an impersonal subject, with the adverbial
functioning as the predicate, e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)wít5la b-lˆle} maláxa m5‰èšle qa-ràbb6n.} ‘In the night the angel woke
the monk.’ (A15:11)
wít5la b-lˆle} xúwwe °èle.} ‘In the night the snake came.’ (A24:40)
xa-béna wít5la hád6x b-lˆle} mèxy5le taq-taq-táq l-t9ra.} ‘Then, at night,
there was a knock at the door.’ (A23:26)
wít5la bar-""o-náša sáwa ßèly5le mt>mòz6lla ë6nn6k7ra díya,} ""áp-""aw ßèly5le
mhayóre ta-d-o-sàwa.} ‘After that old man went down to clean around
it, he also went down to help the old man.’ (A14:77)In (10) the two constructions are combined, in that it contains both a
prepositional phrase and a nominal without a preposition:
(10) wít5la b-lˆle,} dána t-dmàxa,} xílela mêndi.} wít5la dána t-dmàxa,} x6mmêr°a,}
x6mmèr°6 šên°a} šqìlt6lla,} mutt7°6lla r6š-ßádr6t xmá°a dìya.} ‘At night,
the time of sleep, they ate something. At the time of sleep, she
(Leli°a) took a bead, a bead of sleep, and put it on the chest of
her mother-in-law’. (A19:3)
In the discourse structure of narratives, constructions with initial adverbials discussed in this section are disjunctive in function and mark the onset
of new episode.
(iv) Combined with the Existential Particle
When the verb has an existential function, the copula is sometimes replaced
by the existential particle (""i°, li°), e.g.
(1)
(2)lí° wíya ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Nothing has happened.’ (A29:22)
lì° hátxa mèndi wíya gu-mðíta.} ‘Nothing like that has happened in
the town.’ (A22:2)704chapter fifteenSuch constructions may refer to a situation that arises through a series
of recurrent events, e.g.
(3) ""í°wa rába xlulàne} wíye gu-mà°a.} ‘Many weddings took place in the
village.’ (B15:73)
15.4.2. The Infinitive Combined with the Verb ‘to be’
15.4.2.1. General Remarks
The infinitive may be combined with the various copulas and inflections
of the verb hwy to form a compound verbal form.
This construction originated historically as a locative predication, with
the locative preposition b- ‘in’ attached to the infinitive. In some NENA
dialects this preposition is still regularly used with the infinitive in the
construction, e.g. C. Urmi b-grašel6 ‘he is pulling’, but in C. Barwar the
preposition is normally elided and is only heard sporadically. Examples
attested in the text corpus include:
(1) hóle b-°áya ""axêll5xu.} ‘He is coming to eat you.’ (A13:14)
(2) †ˆre} hóla b-°áya l-qàle.} ‘The birds are coming at (the sound of ) his
voice.’ (A25:43)
(3) ""u-†árp6t d5rúb6r hóla b-n°àra.} ‘The leaves of the wood are falling.’
(A25:46)
(4) b-xyára b-zeðàye.} ‘He looks at the pitta breads.’ (A30:11)
(5) b-txár6n ‘I remember’ (B15:84)
The b- is regularly used only in the fixed phrase b-xšaw5n ‘I think’.
15.4.2.2. Progressive Function
The infinitive may be combined with the deictic copula, the basic copula
or the negative copula. When the basic copula is used, this is in its enclitic
form. As has been shown in §15.3.1–§15.3.2., the enclitic basic copula
and the deictic copula are used with predicates expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent basic copula is used
only with predicates expressing permanent properties that, typically, are
intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have not been acquired.
As will be shown below, the infinitive compound construction expresses
a transient activity that is not a permanent property of the subject and
so it is in principle not appropriate to use the independent copula in the
construction.","[739, 740, 741, 742, 743]"

the indirect object with all forms of the verb:

When a verb has both a pronominal direct object and a pronominal indirect object, the direct object is generally expressed by an L-suffix attached
to the verb and the indirect object by one of the prepositional phrases
desribed in §8.19.5. When the suffix of the direct pronominal object ends
in a vowel, the initial syllable of the ""6ll- phrase is often elided and the
phrase is linked to the verb in the same stress group:

8.20.1. The Existential Particles ""i° and li°
As elsewhere in NENA, the C. Barwar dialect expresses predications of
existence (‘there is’, ‘there are’) by an existential particle. The basic form
of this is ""i°. On some occasions the form is extended by attaching various
supplementary suffixes as follows:
Default
""í°6n
""í°ga
""í°g6nLong
""í°ena
""í°genaThese supplementary suffixes are the same as those that are attached to
imperative forms.
The negative form of the existential particle is li°, which has developed
historically by the merger of the elements la + i°. The coalescence of the
vowels /a/ + /i/ to /i/ rather than to the expected /5/ is likely to have
arisen by analogy with the /i/ vowel in the positive form ""i°. The negative
particle may also be extended by supplementary suffixes:
Default
lí°6n
lí°ga
lí°g6nLong
lí°ena
lí°genaverbs293The existential particles can be given past time reference in the manner
of verbs by attaching the particle -wa to their basic forms: ""í°wa, lí°wa.
The L-series suffixes are added to the basic forms of the particles to
express possession. The final fricative /°/ generally shifts to a stop /t/
when in direct contact with the /l/ of the suffix (cf. §1.4.1.3.), e.g. ""ítli (< ""i°
+ li) ‘I have (literally: there is to me)’, lítli (< li° + li) ‘I have not’. A few
isolated cases are attested in which this shift does not take place, e.g. ""í°li
‘I have’ (A7:9). The fricative regularly remains when the /l/ is separated
from the /°/ by the past tense marker -wa, e.g. ""í°wali ‘I had’, lí°wali ‘I
had not’. The full paradigms of these forms are as follows:

15.3.6. Past Copula Placed before the Predicate
Constructions with the copula placed before the predicate are likewise
unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that it may
express a permanent (1–7) or contingent (8–9) situation. There is no past
form of the deictic copula and the construction Subject—""iwa—Predicate,
therefore, corresponds to both that of the independent present copula
(Subject—""ile—Predicate) and that of the deicitc copula (Subject—hole—
Predicate).

m-bar-hàd6x} q5mìwa} mzabóne ""ilàna.} náše ""íwa kòpa.} ‘After that they

topical prominence, as is the case in Subject—""ile—Predicate constructions. In the examples occurring in the text corpus, the topical prominence
generally results from the fact that the referent has been evoked in the638chapter fifteenimmediately preceding context. Note that in (5), however, the referent has
not been previously activated, but it plays a central role in the following
context.
When the copula is placed before the predicate, the clause has some
kind of communicative salience. This is reflected by the fact that it is
restricted to assertive, factive clauses and is not used in non-factive, interrogative clauses. The communicative salience in the examples occurring
in the text corpus can in most cases be shown to have a discourse function. The clauses generally mark some kind of semantic boundary in
the discourse. In (1) and (2) the copula clauses constitute an explanatory
elaboration concerning a referent that has been evoked in the preceding
context that breaks the flow of the discourse. Also in (3) the construction is used in a clause that is explanatory of what precedes. The clause
in (4) is a summarizing remark, which marks the end of a section. The
constructions in (5)–(7) occur at the beginning of a section of discourse
that supply important preliminary material. The same applies also to (8),
where the construction is used to express a contingent situation. In (9) the
copula clause denotes a contingent situation that is circumstantial to the
event referred to in the previous clause and does not carry the narrative
line forward.
In (10) the past copula is used in a different type of function, namely
to introduce a time adverbial at an episodic boundary of discourse. The
copula here gives morpological weight to the initial adverbial expression
and is not translatable directly into idiomatic English:
(10) ""íwa sá""6t tmánya qédamta xzéli xákma náše °àya} m6n-""æn-Nune ta-Dùre.}
‘At eight o’clock in the morning I saw some people coming from
""“n-Nune to Dure.’ (B1:11)
15.3.7. The Negative Copula
The present and past negative copula forms refer to states, both permanent (1–3) and contingent (4–6), in the present and past respectively.
They correspond, therefore, to both the basic and deictic forms of the
positive copula:
(1)
(2)
(3)""áwwa lˆle kálba.} ‘He is not a dog.’ (A11:20)
l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this land.’ (A25:82)

lˆwa yóm6t šáb°a.} ‘It was not Saturday.’ (A14:58)
""ína l7wa mèdre gnàyux.} ‘But it was not your fault again.’ (A1:25)15.3.8. The Existential Particles
The existential particle ""i°, together with its variant forms (§8.20.1.),
expresses either a permanent (1–3) or a contingent (4–6) situation:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""í°6n xa-†ùra.} ‘There is a mountain.’ (A24:11)
""í°6n biš-gù‰e mènni.} ‘There are better men than me.’ (A26:79)
""ítli ðá brat6t-màma.} ‘I have a cousin.’ (A7:17)
""í°6n tàma} †è¬¬6° bná°a xène.} ‘There are there three other girls.’
(A26:24)
""ána ""í° šùla qámi.} ‘There is work in front of me (to do).’ (A24:45)
""ítli xákma xabráne t-amrênn6x.} ‘I have a few words to say to you.’
(A4:40)The existential particle is sometimes combined with the deictic copula,
e.g.
(7)
(8)hóla ""í°6n jênne gáwa!} ‘There are jinn in it!’ (A22:33)
hóle ""í°6n xà} k6s-tòto} sàwta.} ‘There is somebody at the home of the
old woman.’ (A24:44)
(9) qam-""árya hóle ""ì°6n} gêlla.} ""u-qam-""èzza hóle ""ì°6n} bêsra.} šqúl bêsra} m-qam""êzza} dríle qam-""àrya.} ""u-gêlla} šqúlle m-k6s-""àrya} drìle} qa-""êzza.} ‘Before
the lion there is grass and before the she-goat there is meat. Take
the meat from before the goat and put it before the lion. Take the
grass from the lion and offer it to the she-goat.’ (A24:15)
(10) qàwra} ""í°6n xa-káwe gàwa} ""u-hóle ""í°6n jawêtta,} jawètt6t práma qˆse.} ""iq7ma xa-dalí°6t xùwwe} ""i-x8ða l-án tre-xoriyà°a.} kút ""ás6q qamáya xazéla
""5-dalí°a brì°6ll-ani} parêmla.} ‘There is a hole in the grave. There is a
chopper, a chopper to cut wood. A wild vine grows up and winds
around those two willow trees. The first to see the vine growing
on those (trees) cuts it down.’ (A26:91)
(11) hóle ""í°6n bóya zòra.} ‘There is a small hole.’ (A20:5)
(12) hóle ""í°6n làxxa} stêrra.} ‘There is here a storeroom.’ (A23:17)
These examples express both contingent (7–9) and permanent (10–12)
situations. The crucial conditioning factor for the use of the deictic copula640chapter fifteenis not the nature of the situation expressed by the predicate, but rather
the discourse prominence that the speaker wishes to give to the referent
introduced by the clause. In (7) the force of the deictic copula is to express
the unexpectedness of the existence of jinn. In the remaining examples
the referent introduced plays a prominent role in the ensuing discourse.
In (8) the man at the home of the old woman is the protagonist of the
following narrative. In (9) the grass and the meat are in the centre of
attention in what follows. In (10) the deictic copula is used with the clause
introducing the ‘chopper’ but not in the one introducing the ‘hole’ in the
grave. It is the activity associated with the chopper that is the concern of
the following discourse, as shown in the cited example, whereas the ‘hole’
is only an incidental referent. In (11) and (12) the referent introduced acts
as the spatial setting for the following section of discourse.
The past existential particle (""i°wa) and the negative existential particle
(li°, li°wa) are, likewise, used to express a permanent (13–15) or contingent
(16–18) situation. They are not, however, combined with the deictic copula:
(13) ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘There was a king.’ (A1:2)
(14) lì°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} ‘There are not steps for them to go
down into the basement stable.’ (A22:10)
(15) ""7-ga lí°wa bêrqa.} ‘At that time there was not electricity.’ (B10:45)
(16) ""í°wa bráta dmíxta kèsle dìye.} ‘There was a girl sleeping with him.’
(A26:6)
(17) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Is there nobody in the house?’ (A22:32)
(18) lì°wale qußàrta.} ‘He did not have a cooking-pot.’ (A5:1)
The noun that is introduced by an existential particle may refer to a
specific item, as in the majority of the examples above, or to a class (18).
Further examples of constructions with class nouns:
(19) ""í°6n bê†ma.} ‘There is the terebinth tree.’ (B5:220)
(20b) ""í°wa ""9raq.} ‘There was arak.’ (B5:11)
(21) ""í°wa lèxma y-amrèxwa zeðàye.} ‘There was bread that we called
zeðaye.’ (B5:15)
(22) ""í°wa xyápt6t xêtna.} ‘There was the washing of the groom.’
(B5:25)
There is no clear functional distinction between the short and long variants of the existential particles. They appear to be in free variation. Inthe syntax of verbs641a series of two parallel clauses containing the particles, however, a short
variant is often followed by a long variant, giving the final clause of the
pair end-weighting, e.g.
(23) xùy5le,} púrya lì°,} b6rqa lì°6n.} ‘It is dark. There is no light and there
is no electricity.’ (A23:29)
(24) ‘ù-qala lí°.} ‘ú-qala lí°6n m6nnèy.} ‘There is no sound. There is no
sound of them.’ (A18:15)
On many occasions the present existential particles (""i°, li°) occur in the
context of past form verbs and have past tense reference, sharing their
deictic centre with these verbs.
(25) qímela xìlela.} qímela šqílela xa-""amána xàn‘i zóra.} mútt6lla k6s-réša dìya.}
ßáw°a lì°6n.} ‘They ate. Then they took a small container and put
it at her head. There was no speech (with this).’ (A21:17–18)
(26) mútt6lla gu-""a†nàb6l} ""u-nùbl6lla.} ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya,} zùrt5la,}
qaráw6t d-àwwa} ""u-t-yèmme díye,} ""u-""al-""9ra} lí° ‘ù-m6ndi,} lá kursìya}
""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They put her in a car and took her off. He had
one room like this one, it was small, his bed and his mother’s, on
the floor there was nothing, no chair, nothing.’ (A21:5)
15.3.9. The Verb hwy
In addition to the various copulas and the existential particles, the verb
‘to be’ may be expressed by the verb hwy, which is inflected in all verbal
bases. Many of the inflections of this verb supply functions that are not
expressed by the copulas or existential particles, though in some cases
there is functional overlap.
15.3.9.1. qa†6l
15.3.9.1.1. Realis
The qa†6l form of hwy, without any prefixed particle, is occasionally used in
a realis sense, referring imperfectively to a situation in the present, e.g.
(1)
(2)""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} xlìmta hóya.} ‘A zeðaya bread is thicker. It is
thick.’ (B6:49)
""u-xàkma dukáne} xà-yoma háwe ""éða.} ‘In some places the festival is for
one day.’ (B6:2)642chapter fifteen(3) hal-""aßèrta ""áw háwe šulˆni.} ‘This is our activity until the evening’
(B6:11)
(4) yóm6t ""èsri-w xámša háwe ""èða.} ‘The twenty-fifth day is the festival’
(B6:13)
(5) ""ína ""áyy6t xúmßa har-xúmßa háwe xwarnàya.} ‘But the dish consisting
only of xumßa is whitish.’ (B10:16)
(6) ""ˆ-ga} Rustám ""o-mtán5 mènne y-ámri ""7-g6 damêxwa,} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°à
l5l>wá°a háwe dmìxa.} ‘Now, they say of Rustam that when he slept,
he would be asleep for three days and three nights.’ (A29:2)
(7) har-dmáxta dìy6n} biz-zóda gu-b5°wà°a hóya.} ‘Our sleeping is mostly
in the houses.’ (B15:27)
(8) qedámta hál bar-kawù°ra} šèmša y-óya bà°6r †úra,} fa-†êlla háwe} qam-†ùra.}
‘In the morning, until after lunch, the sun is behind the mountain
and there is shade at the front of the mountain.’ (B3:2)
These examples exhibit differences regarding the referential status of the
subject and the nature of the predicate. They may be divided into three
categories.
(i) In (1)–(5) the subject has generic reference and the predicate denotes
a permanent situation.
(ii) In (6) the subject has a specific referent and the predicate refers to
a habitual, iterative situation.
(iii) In (7)–(8) the subject has generic reference and the predicate refers
to a habitual, iterative situation.
The functional profile (i) may also be expressed by the basic copula.
Indeed, in (1) the independent basic copula is used in a parallel clause.
As we shall see, in this profile the predicate may also have the ""i-qa†6l
form of hwy. Clauses with the profiles (ii) and (iii), with habitual iterative
predicates, are usually expressed by the ""i-qa†6l form of hwy rather than
the copula. A parallel to (6) with y-áwe rather than háwe is, in fact, used
by the speaker later in the same text (†¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°á l5l>wá°a y-áwe
dmíxa A29:19). Also in (8), the ""i-qa†6l form y-óya is used in a preceding
parallel clause. All the occurrences of the qa†6l form of hwy cited above,
therefore, can be regarded as variants of the more usual ""i-qa†6l form. They
are unlikely to have arisen by the phonetic elision of the ""i- prefix, since
the ""i-qa†6l form is y-awe (< ""i-hawe), in which the prefix is followed by a
vowel and so is protected from elision. The qa†6l form here is more likely
to be an extension of the irrealis qa†6l (§15.3.9.1.2.). The crucial featurethe syntax of verbs643of the example above is that the predications lack specificity either due
to the subject being a generic class term or due to the predicate being
habitual. A predicate with this lack of specificity and distinctness is closer
semantically to an irrealis predicate than a more individuated one that
denotes a specific situation relating to a specific referent.
The form occurs more frequently in verbs expressing habitual aspect
in subordinate temporal clauses. The subordinating particle D of the
temporal conjunction is usually prefixed to the verb, e.g.
(9)lé-y-maßi m†áli b-5-dàn t-áwe yòma.} ‘They cannot play when it is
daytime.’ (B11:2)
(10) ""áyya †awálta m†alíwala rába b-sêtwa,} ""5-g6 t-áwe tàlga,} š-gar>wà°a.}
‘They played this game a lot in the winter, when there was snow,
on top of the roofs.’ (B11:16)
(11) ""áp-xa la-xazèla,} ""a-dán6 t-áwe †lìya yála.} ‘Nobody sees it, when the
child is asleep.’ (B10:77)
(12) ""u-""7g6t t-áwe xá m6nn7ni qúrb6 d-o-xèna,} har-maxênne} t>bálli l-t>bálle
dìye,} ""aw-mìtle,} ""aw-prìqle,} ""aw-xsìrre.} ‘When one of us is near to
the other, I strike my marble against his marble and he dies, he is
finished, he has lost.’ (B11:27)
(13) ""7-g6t háwi náše ràba} hálbat búš náša b-‰áy6š b-gáne dìye.} ‘When there are
many people, of course a person feels himself more.’ (B15:15)
15.3.9.1.2. Irrealis
The most usual function of the qa†6l form of hwy is to express irrealis,
which cannot be expressed by any of the copula forms or existential
particles. It occurs in the same irrealis contexts as the qa†6l form of other
verbs, which have been described in §15.1.1.5–10.
The form may be used in a main clause, where it often expresses
deontic modality, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)háw6t basíma ràba.} ‘May you be very well.’ (A5:7)
háw6t hèšy6r ""ítl6n jênne.} ‘Be careful, we have jinn.’ (A22:26)
ya-""àlaha,} háwe ßáxi hál-""5-g6t ""ána má†y6n ""èlle dìye.} ‘Oh God, let him
be well until I reach him.’ (A26:80)
hóya mxí°a l-mìla.} ‘Let it be (= let’s say it was) covered in blue.’
(A4:29)This also applies to the expression la hoya ‘It should not be’, ‘It is not
allowed’, ‘It is not possible’, e.g.","[675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681, 682]"
"the syntax of verbs759(6) ""áxni y-amríl6n be-Hˆdo ""áxni.} ‘We—they call us (= we are called) the
house of H5do.’ (B4:7)
15.10. Verbal Constructions with the Particle HEŠ
15.10.1. heš in Positive Clauses
The particle heš, which is of Kurdish origin, is used to modify the verbal
predicate in various ways. In positive clauses heš is used with the sense of
‘still’, expressing the persistence of an enduring situation. The form of
the verb is one that can express such a situation, e.g.
(1) ""áy heš-hóla gu-gòma.} ‘She is still in the basement stable.’ (A18:22)
(2) héš xúya xùy5le.} ‘It is still very dark.’ (A30:36)
(3) heš-hóle plàxa.} ‘He is still working.’
(4) heš-hóle dmìxa.} ‘He is still asleep’.
(5) heš-máße jàw6j.} ‘He can still move.’
It may also be used with a verb expressing the persistence of an iterative
situation, e.g.
(6) ""áw náša sàw5le,} bás heš-y-áz6l šúla kùt-yum.} ‘He is an old man, but
he still goes to work every day’.
15.10.2. heš + Negator
When the particle heš precedes a negator, the construction denotes the
persistence of a negated situation and the sense of ‘not yet’. This is in
principle used with the negative copula or with a negated form of a verb
that expresses an enduring or iterative situation. These are most commonly
compound constructions with the resultative participle or infinitive, all of
which express an enduring negated situation. It is generally cliticized to
the negator and is often contracted to the form š-, e.g.
(1) heš-l7le làxxa.} ‘He is not here yet.’
(2) heš-l7le ""ê°ya.} ‘He has not come yet.’
(3) xalwála-w ""ap-xá‘‘a xéna šóqa †la-mòja.} qá-t ""ap-""áw zòr5le,} sab-qá-t š-l7wa
mšúrya xála gêlla.} ‘Then she milks it and leaves a little more for the
calf. This is because it is small and had not yet started to eat grass.’
(B5:175)760chapter fifteen(4) ""è°y5la ""àrye.} ""ê°ye,} ""ê°ye,} š-l7wa mè†ye ""6lle-dìye.} ‘The lions came. They
came, but they had not yet reached him.’ (A18:26)
It may be used with infinitive constructions in subordinate clauses that
lack the copula. In such cases the infinitive is often negated by the particle
t-la ‘without’, e.g.
(5) q6m-dári ""an-dáwwe heš-t-là bráza.} ‘They have poured out the dawwe
while it is not yet dry.’ (B14:1)
(6) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} ‘Don’t you
know that she has been betrothed to me since before she was born?’
(A25:39)
(7) š-lá-praqa ""o-pék dìye} ""o-xáwri hád6x gabbàra,} xáz6x wírre gawàye.} ‘Before
my friend, a huge man, had finished his measure (of whiskey), we
saw him go inside.’ (B15:58)
15.10.3. Negator + heš
When the negator precedes the particle, it has the sense of ‘no longer’,
in that it expresses the end of an enduring or iterative situation that was
previously in existence. It is attested with qa†6l base forms expressing the
end of an iterative situation in the future. The sequence la-heš generally
contracts to leš, l5š, laš or l6š, e.g.
(1) léš-""a°6x hayorêxlux.} ‘We shall no longer come to help you.’ (A48:6)
(2) qìm5le,} mêÄya} ""u-wíða tawq≈' ""u-kúl m6ndì,} qá-t ""áyya leš-dáre bas-dìya.}
‘He signed and authorized it, and so forth, (pledging) that he would
never again talk about it.’ (A8:97)
(3) leš-faydál6x qá†l6t gàn6x.} ‘It will no longer be of any use to you to kill
yourself.’ (A38:16)
It is found with the qa†6l form of the verb mßy ‘to be able’, used with
habitual aspect and with future reference, e.g.
(4) sab-""6n-wèle šxánta ràba,} léš-maß6t ""atw6t †¬a°à-metre} rè˙qa m6n-ßùpa.} ‘For
if it has become very hot, you can no longer sit three metres from
the stove.’ (B15:25)
(5) léš-maße-náša palè†le qále dìye.} ‘A person can no longer utter his voice.’
(B15:39)
(6) ""áql6t sus7xu ""6n-píšla kèpa,} léš maßítu jawjìtu.} ‘If the legs of your horses
have become stone, you will no longer be able to move.’ (A8:28)the syntax of verbs761When the construction is used with the negative copula, the particle heš is
inserted between the negator la and the copula, viz. la-heš-ile, e.g.
(7)léš-ile gu-bˆ°a.} ‘He is no longer in the house.’In the text corpus this is attested in compound verbal forms consisting of
the copula and the resultative participle or infinitive, e.g.
(8)mo-t-àw6ð?} léš-ile mêßya.} ‘What can he do? He can no longer do
anything.’ (A8:96)
(9) l7š-in xzàya,} lán-mßaya jwàja.} ‘I can no longer see and I cannot
walk.’ (A24:2)
(10) láš-it ðà""6lli?} ‘Don’t you know me any more?’ (A12:65)
(11) láš-iyewa mßáya x9yewa.} ‘He could no longer make a living.’
(A30:1)
In (12) the particle is used in a compound infinitive construction in which
the copula has been omitted:
(12) léš-awwa mßáya má†e ‘ù-duk°a.} ‘He can no longer reach any place.’
(A37:14)
15.11. Verbal Constructions with the Particle HAR
The particle har is combined with verbs to perform numerous functions.
These functions can be classified broadly into two opposing semantic
domains, viz. extension and narrowing.
15.11.1. Extension
Under this head can be included various uses of the particle to express
the extension and continuity of a situation.
The particle can be used as an intensifier to underscore the enduring
nature of a situation, e.g.
(1)
(2)har-d6bbóre zál5la-w °áya dúrr dúrr dùrr.} ‘The hornets constantly flew
back and forth.’ (A20:6)
har-bxàya-wawa.} ‘They were constantly crying.’ (A25:5)762
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)chapter fifteen
har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘I shall constantly keep to God’s way.’
(A15:21)
""u-""áti har-háw6t baràye} ""u-sápr6t ku-t-á°e làxxa.} ‘You be outside all the
time and wait for whoever comes here.’ (A22:23)
har-blíg6t b-kàsux.} ‘You are always busy with your stomach.’ (A23:10)
har-xwàrta wáwa.} ‘It was always white.’ (A4:36)It occurs in this sense in clauses in which the copula is omitted, e.g.
(7)
(8)""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha.} har-dbíše b-bronèy.} ‘They did not pray to
God. They were constantly attached to their son.’ (A15:17)
""a-d-áy á¬áy6lla kùlle míya} ""a-d-áw har-áê¬ya.} ‘She fills hers all with
water. His was constantly full.’ (A17:25)It may be combined with verbs denoting habitual or iterative activities
to express an intensified frequency. The verb is either in the ( ""i-)qa†6l or
wele q†ala form, e.g.
""ánna-t ""árxe har-y-oðíwa nùra gu-b7°a.} ‘People who had mills would
always make a fire in the house.’ (A19:4)
(10) xèlma náša hár ""i-xàze.} ‘People always dream.’ (A4:7)
(11) ""u-""áyya har-šaqláwa m6n-d-àn šíše} mattàwa} ""èlla dìya} hál ""7-g6t q6mqa†làla.} ‘She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron
bars and putting them into her, until she killed her.’ (A19:6)
(12) kazíwa prám6lla har-pal†ìwa.} ‘They tried to cut them down, but they
kept growing up.’ (A38:15)
(13) har-wéla taq-táq mxàya} ""u-taq-tàq,} xá-bena-w trè,} w-áwwa sqìdle.} ‘They
continually made a taq-taq knocking noise, taq-taq, once, then
twice, then he became fed up.’ (A14:68)
(9)When used with a verb expressing a non-iterative perfective action, it
expresses the sense of repetition of the action and can usually be translated ‘again’, e.g.
(14) yóm6t †¬à°a} har-ßlèla.} ‘On the third day she went down again.’
(A22:18)
(15) ""6n-lì° biš-zlíme mènn6n,} har-t-àz6x.} ‘If there are none more wronged
than us, we shall again go (on our way).’ (A13:9)the syntax of verbs763The particle may have the sense of ‘still’, expressing the temporal persistence of a situation in contexts where there is typically some expectation
that the situation would not persist. The clause either contains a copula
or a compound infinitive verbal form, which expresses action in progress,
e.g.
(16) har-xà°ila.} ‘She is still my sister.’ (A18:27)
(17) ""u-d6bbóre hár-hola qam-t8r6t bòya.} ‘The hornets were still before the
door of the hole.’ (A20:9)
(18) hár-dwaq6t rêqqi?} ‘Do you still insist (on what you said)?’ (A40:4)
When, however, the clause contains one of the set of verbs denoting
mental processes which express the progressive by the qa†6l form rather
than the compound infinitive form (§15.1.1.4.), the verb is generally put
in the ""i-qa†6l form, e.g.
(19) har-xá°e ""i-b9yela.} ‘He still loves his sister.’ (A18:16)
In this sense the particle may be used together with a verb negated by la or
the negative copula. The final /r/ sometimes shifts to /l/ by assimilation to
the initial /l/ of the negator, e.g. hal-la (< har-la), hal-l5le (< har-l5le), e.g.
(20) ""áy har-là-yaw6lla.} ‘It still does not give it back.’ (A34:4)
(21) hal-lˆla gláya.} ‘She (the mother) still does not reveal (the truth).’
(A38:6)
It occurs with this sense in clauses from which the copula has been elided,
e.g.
(22) har-m-r6š-gàre,} mêra} ‘While still on the roof, she said . . .’ (A26:75)
(23) bén6 †è¬¬6° mòdi wídle?} hár mdagòle gu-má°a,} ""áwwa hàtx5le wíða-w} ""áwwa
hàtx5le míra-w} ""áwwa hàtx5le,} dráya búxt6n l-xá l-d-o-xèna} ‘What did
he do the third time? He continued to tell lies in the village “He
did such-and-such. He said such-and-such,” slandering this one
and that one.’ (A48:5)
The particle is used with a perfective verb as an intensifier to underscore
sequentiality. It expresses the occurrence of an action that may not
be expected to occur in sequence to what precedes. In most cases it is764chapter fifteenappropriate to translate the particle in such contexts by ‘still’ (in a logical
sense) or ‘nevertheless’, e.g.
(24) k6mêt t-árqena} tópe har-†apyàli.} ‘However much I run, a gun will still
reach me.’ (B9:3)
(25) mqáwl6t goràtle,} t-yálla jùlla.} ""6n-là,} har-t-yálla júll6x b-kèf6x.} ‘If you
promise to marry him, he will give back the clothes. If not, he
will still give you the clothes, if you want them.’ (A14:83)
(26) málka ""áti har-t-yàtli brátux?} ‘King, will you still give me your daughter?’ (A25:24)
(27) mère hár t-azèna.} mère hár t-azèt?} mère hˆ!} ‘He said “I’ll still go.” He
said “Will you still go?” He said “Yes!” ’ (A8:45)
(28) ""áwwa q†ílle xmàre,} ""u-q†ílle sùsa,} q†ílle tàwra,} ""ánna kúlla q†ilìle,} har-mère
ma-yxàl6f.} ‘He had killed the asses, killed the horse, killed the ox.
He had killed them all. He (the uncle) still said “That is all right.” ’
(A23:31)
It may be used with a negated verb with a similar function, e.g.
(29) har-là-wela rázi.} ‘She was still not satisfied.’ (A30:34)
(30) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
times we have sat together, I still have not been able to be like
him.’ (A25:44)
(31) hal-la xzeli ""u-hal-la swili. ‘I, nevertheless, have not found (anybody)
and I, nevertheless, have not been satisfied.’ (C3:8)
On some occasions har is replaced by the particle hala, which is attested
in a few cases in the text corpus before a negative copula or negative
existential particle, e.g.
(32) síq5le gu-réš6t ""Amedìya,} ""ìna} núr6t xàle} t-íwa síqa l-tàma} gu-zòma} hála
lˆle óèmya.} ‘He went up to the top of Amedia and saw that the fire
in the summer house of his maternal uncle, where he was making
for, had still not gone out.’ (A25:40)
(33) ""áwwa nàša} hála lìtwale.} ‘This man still did not yet have (a son).’
(A8:5)the syntax of verbs76515.11.2. Narrowing
Under this head can be included the use of har to express temporal immediacy of sequence, as in (1)–(4), in which it is combined with a perfective
verb with the sense of ‘as soon as’, e.g.
(1)(2)(3)
(4)har-ðìl5xu príql6n m6n-†úra,} d7r6n tòpe,} kút-xa maxèla} xánj6r dìye,} ""o-t-íle
qáme díye qa†êlle.} ‘As soon as you know that we have finished (coming over) the mountain, I shall fire a gun and everyone will strike
with his dagger and kill the man in front of him.’ (B19:6)
har-wéla dán6t kawù°ra,} xzélux xa-náša °àya,} málla bt-à°e,} t-áw6r
gu-bˆ°a} yá'ni xamšá daqíqela hal-""êßra} ""áti ""à°eti.} ‘As soon as lunchtime
has come and you have seen a man coming—the mullah will come
and enter the house—after five or ten minutes you come back.’
(A22:22)
har-qítla bìyux,} qa†lílux t-axlìlux.} ‘As soon as they hit you, they will
kill you and eat you.’ (A22:39)
""u-hadíya brát6t màlka} har-xázya ""áxni zmára-w rqàða} ""áy jal-jálde t-ásqa
l-gàre.} ‘Now, as soon as the daughter of the king sees that we
are singing and dancing, she will quickly come up to the roof.’
(A27:28)Another form of temporal immediacy is illustrated in (5), in which the
particle has the sense of ‘directly’:
(5)har-""è°y5le m6n-†úra réša-reša d-o-gàre.} ‘He came directly from the
mountain onto the roof.’ (A23:14)The particle may be used to express some kind of narrowing of the extent
of action. In such cases it is usually appropriate to translate it ‘just’, e.g.
(6)""ína bróna lˆla xílt6lle.} har-nobált6lle mutt7°6lle mattòye.} ‘She did not eat
the boy. She just took him and put him down.’ (A19:7)
(7) ""ána har-ßál6n mðìta} m7°6n ""ixàla} ""u-""à°ena.} ‘I’ll just go down to the
town to bring food and come back.’ (A26:30)
(8) har-""ásq6n gu-qáßr6t bàbi,} har-šáql6n rìxa mènne.} bálki xa-xóni, xá°i xáz6n,}
xa-nàši.} ‘I shall just go up to my father’s palace, I’ll just have a quick
look (literally: take a smell of it), perhaps I shall find a brother of
mine, my sister, a relative or mine.’ (A18:16)
(9) har-sa-xúpla ""áti b-gàn6x!} ‘Just go and wash her yourself !’ (A27:25)
(10) har-šúqla tàma.} ‘Just leave alone over there.’ (A25:53)766chapter fifteenAlso under the head of ‘narrowing’ can be included the function of har
to act as an intensifier of an assertion, e.g.
(11) xà-yoma,} har-mítle b6-duzù°a.} ‘One day he indeed really died.’
(A27:42)
(12) b-álaha hóle xa-púrya láxxa zòra} ""áw har-xá-mdi ""ìle.} ‘By God, there is
a small chink of light here. It is surely something.’ (A14:25)
(13) har-xá-m6ndi ""ì° b-áyya dúk°a t-íle wìra.} ‘There must surely be something in this place where it entered.’ (A11:9)
(14) ""áxni har-xòn6n-it.} ‘You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)
(15) g8r6g ""àmr6x.} ""ay-xá-yoma har-t-y9ða} t-íle mí°a bròn6n.} ‘We must
tell (her). She will surely know one day that our son is dead.’
(A4:38–39)
(16) ya-""àlahi.} xúya har-xùy5le.} har-déwe t-axlìli.} har-t-áz6n gu-d-ànna
hambišáye} har-hambišàye-≥i t-axlíli.} ‘My God, it is very dark, either
wolves are sure to eat me or I shall go to these giants and the
giants are sure to eat me.’ (A39:4)
(17) mère ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya.} ‘I’m indeed finished!’ (A14:25)
It is used also to intensify a negated assertion (18) and a prohibition (19),
e.g.
(18) har-là-mß6n t-amrènnux.} ‘I cannot tell you.’ (A11:2)
(19) har-la-šqúlla biš-spày.} ‘Do not take it off, it is better.’ (A39:14)
15.12. The Distribution of the Long Endings of Verbs
Various long endings of verbs are optionally used for the first person singular and plural and second person singular inflections of qa†6l base forms
that do not have further suffixes attached (§8.2.1.). An examination of their
distribution in the text corpus shows that these long verbal inflections are
conditioned by the position of their occurrence in the intonation group. In
the vast majority of cases they occur at the end of the intonation group,
immediately before the group boundary. They should, therefore, be considered to be a type of prosodic pausal form. They, moreover, normally
take the nuclear stress. Examples:
(1)b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman mˆ°ena.} ‘I want to know when I shall die.’
(A16:1)the syntax of verbs
(2)
(3)
(4)

(6)
(7)(8)
(9)767""u-xètna l-b7°a pˆšena.} ‘And I shall become a son-in-law in the
house.’ (A17:35)
""ána bt-àzena.} ‘I shall go.’ (A25:32)
mó ""amràna?} ‘What should I say?’ (A26:33)
dán5la jàwjexi.} ‘It is time for us to move.’ (A30:44)
t-áz6t ""askarìya,} láz6m ""àzeti.} ‘You have to go to the army, you must
go.’ (A17:22)
xàr°a,} pàl†eti} ""ap-""aßèrta hàd6x.} ""u-""áti har-háw6t baràye} ""u-sápr6t
ku-t-á°e làxxa.} m-bá°6r xámša daqìqe} ""áti ""àwreti.} ‘Then, you go
out, and in the evening (do) the same. You be outside all the time
and wait for whoever comes here. After five minutes you should
come in.’ (A22:23)
xzí gàw‰a,} xzi-maßì°eti.} ‘Look husband, look listen!’ (A22:15)
""áp-""ati sì} pàlxeti.} ‘You also go and work.’ (A23:2)Another factor that conditions the use of a long inflectional form is discourse structure, in that the heavy morphology of a long form is sometimes used to mark a boundary of a discourse section. This is seen in
(10), where the narrator repeats a key statement of the protagonist. The
second version of the statement differs from the first in the use of the
long form mˆ°ena in place of the short form m7°6n. Both occur at the end
of the intonation group. The motivation to use the long form appears to
be to mark the end of the section of speech:
(10) mère b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""ìman m7°6n.} mère b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman
mˆ°ena.} ‘He said “I want to know when I shall die.” He said “I
want to know when I shall die.” ’ (A16:1)
This can be seen also in (11), in which the verbal phrase ‘you obey me’
occurs three times, in two instances of which at an intonation group
boundary. The long form, however, is used in only one of these instances.
This coincides with a discourse boundary in that it occurs at the end of
a conditional construction. The short form before an intonation group
boundary, however, does not coincide with such a discourse boundary,
but rather at the end of a protasis, which requires completion by the
following clause:
(11) ""6n-""àti} mášm6t ""êlli} maš6myàti.} ""6n-là mašèmy6t,} sá m7°5le xòn6x} ""uxza-""ˆk5le.} ‘If you (want to) obey me, obey me. If you do not obey
me, go and bring your brother and find where he is (yourself ).’
(A8:64)768chapter fifteenIn the exceptional cases where the long inflection does not occur at the
intonation group boundary, discourse structure appears to be the primary
motivation for the use of the long form, in that it occurs in a clause that
closes a section of discourse. This is the case in (12), in which the clause
in question occurs at the end of a section of speech:
(12) šuréla mjawóde m-©ðàðe} ""7ni nábl6x k6s-d-ˆni.} Zìne nábl6x k6s-M8mo}
lo-M9mo nábl6x k6s-Zíne.} mèra là,} bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.} maq6†làle gáw‰a}
nabléxi Zìne k6s-M8mo.} ‘They started arguing with one another
regarding whom to take to whom. “Should we take Zine to M>mo
or M>mo to Zine?’ They said “No, a woman is treacherous.
She will have her husband killed. Let us take Zine to M>mo.” ’
(A26:2)
The long inflection is virtually without exception avoided in the first of
a series of two or more verbs in a single intonation group. This applies
both to cases where a verb is followed by a complement clause and also
to sequential series of verbs, e.g.
(13) ""ána ""àxxa b8y6n z>réna.} ‘I want to plough here.’ (A30:8)
(14) ""áxni †la-mò ßál6x ""áxni mpal†èxle?} ‘Why should we go down and
release him?’ (A26:77)
(15) q7m6n torênn5y.} ‘I’ll get up and break them up.’ (A30:22)
The optional long form of the 1pl. L-suffix -l5ni, which marks the pronominal subject of the q†ille form, or a pronominal object, exhibits a
similar pattern of distribution. It is predominantly used at the end of an
intonation group, e.g.
(16) kúlla xaràye,} t6xrù°i,} plìl5ni.} ‘In the end, I remember, we separated.’
(B8:9)
(17) ""áwwa b-tayêml5ni.} ‘He will finish us off.’ (A30:41)
(18) hóla xzáy6ll6n qá†u ráqa bá°r6n xàl6ll5ni.} ‘The cat sees us, runs after
us and eats us.’ (A44:1)
(19) sparègle ""ìtl5ni.} ‘We have quinces.’ (B5:218)
(20) ßl>wá°a kúlla mal6pwalˆni.} ‘He taught us all the prayers.’ (B8:16)
The exceptional occurrences of the long form before the end of the intonation group often occur in clauses that mark the boundary of a sectionthe syntax of verbs769of discourse. In (21), for example, the long form occurs in a clause that
constitutes the opening of a section of discourse concerning Christmas:
(21) xàr°a} y-a°él5ni ""èða} ""éð6t be-yàlda.} ‘Then we have (another) festival,
the festival of Christmas.’ (B6:12)
The 3pl. L-suffix has short forms with monophthong (-la, -l5) and long
forms with a diphthong (-ley, -lay). The long forms with a diphthong exhibit
a similar pattern of distribution to that of other long suffixes and can be
considered to be prosodic pausal forms. They are attested predominantly
at the end of an intonation group, e.g.
(22) npílela-w néra nùb6lley.} ‘They fell and the river carried them
away.’ (B3:9)
(23) ""7-g6 °èley,} zílla l-d-7-ma°6 qurðàye.} ‘When they came back, they
went to that village of Kurds.’ (B3:14)
(24) ""u-políse xzéla ""an-yále jwànqe,} q6m-mattíla b-sandùqe,} q6m-hawíla xá‘‘a
""ixàla-w} q6m-x>ðíla hátxa t-la-q5ralèy} ""u-q6m-d5r7la gu-mìya.} ‘The
policemen found the two beautiful children, put them in a chest,
gave them some food, wrapped them up, like this, so that they
would not be cold, and put them in the water.’ (A8:12)
Exceptional cases often occur in clauses that mark the boundary of a section of discourse. In (25), for example, it occurs at the end of an episodic
section in a narrative:
(25) fa-qímla šqílla ganèy.} daw7r6 diyèy} nál6t ""áql6 dawˆra} prìzl5le.} q6m-mattíla
b6-l-'9k6s.} q6m-""as‰ìla.} ""u-plí†ley m6n-tàma.} ‘So, they took themselves
off. Their mules—the shoe of their mules’ feet was made of iron.
They put it on backwards. They tied them (the shoes) on and set
off from there.’ (B3:15–16)
It should be noted that this distribution of the long form of the 3pl. L-suffix
differs from that of the long, diphthongal variants of the 3pl. suffix that
is attached to nouns, which are used more regularly. One reason may be
that the short form of the latter -a is identical with the singular nominal
ending -a. It tends to be used mainly in contexts where the attribution
of the noun to the 3pl. referent is highly predictable, such as inalienable
possessions of the subject (see §14.5.1.).","[797, 798, 799, 800, 801, 802, 803, 804, 805, 806, 807, 808]"
"the syntax of verbs665It would not be appropriate to use the negated q†ille form là °éle if
there is still an expectation that the person will come. If there is such an
expectation the negated resultative form l5le ""6°ya would be used. The latter form asserts that he is currently not in a state of ‘having come’ but it
does not assert that this state is permanent. This is because, as remarked
in §15.3.7., the negative copula does not specify the permanency of the
state. It may denote either a permanent or a contingent state. The form
l5le ""6°ya, therefore, could be used if the speaker expects this state to be
temporary and assumes he will come at some point in the future. If the
construction is combined with the particle heš ‘still, yet’ (e.g. heš l5le ""6°ya ‘He
has not yet come’), the scope of the assertion is narrowed to the present
moment, i.e. at the present moment he is not in a state of ‘having come’,
which implies that he may come at some point in the future.
Since a negative resultative such as l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’ has
generic temporal reference (‘at no time in the past’), it is normal to use
this construction with negative generic time adverbials such as ‘u-ga
‘never’, e.g.
(18) ‘ú-ga l7le ""ê°ya.} ‘He has never come.’
(19) ‘ú-ga lát xêzy6lle?} ‘Have you not ever seen him?’
In what follows we shall present various examples from direct speech in
the text corpus that contain resultative forms and q†ille/q6m-qa†6l forms that
should be translated by the English present perfect. The reasons that led
the speaker to choose one form rather than the other will be examined
in the light of the foregoing discussion.

(10) d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
(11) ßli-mur-""êlle} ‘Go down and say to him . . .’ (A26:37)
When the verbs ßly ‘to go down’ or ""sq ‘to go up’ occur in a tight sequence
to a preceding verb, the sequences can often be rendered idiomatically
by English phrasal verbs containing the elements ‘down’ and ‘up’ respectively, e.g.
(12) zadéle ßàle} gu-xa-‘ále gò‰ta.} ‘He threw him down into a big pit.’
(A22:40)
(13) kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-ar•qwa y-ás6q qám d-o-dèwa.} ‘Every day one of
our sheep would run up to that wolf.’ (A10:5)
18.3.3. mßy/ ""mß ‘to be able’
When used in a past perfective form (mßele, m6ßy5le), this verb is often combined asyndetically in a paratactic relation with the verb that is dependent
on it, in that the second verb is put in a past perfective form (q†ille, q6mqa†6l, q†il5le), e.g. mßele °ele ‘He was able to come’. The same applies to
negated clauses, e.g. la mßele °ele ‘He could not come’, la mßele q6m-""aw6dla
‘He could not do it’. The second verb in a negative construction is semantically irrealis, since the action did not take place. In principle, therefore,940chapter eighteenan irrealis form would be expected. The use of the realis perfective form
has apparently arisen by morphological attraction. This, no doubt, is the
background also of the positive construction. The majority of examples
from the text corpus are negated or occur in interrogative clauses:
(1) là-mßeli mu°yáli.} ‘I could not bring her.’ (A8:55)
(2) ""áyya bàxta} lá-mßela mxumˆla ""•rwe.} ‘The woman could not keep the
sheep.’ (A10:6)
(3) la-mßél6n s•ql6n ßˆda.} ‘We could not go up to hunt.’ (A26:46)
(4) lá-mßeli zrìli.} ‘I could not cultivate.’ (A30:13)
(5) l7la-m6ßye wíðe ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They could not do anything.’ (A8:65)
(6) dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a?} ‘How could he have
made this girl a hard-working housewife?’ (A21:32)
(7) ""ánna tre-yále m8nile m•ßya d6ry•lla gu-šaqì°a?} ‘Who could have put these
two children in the stream?’ (A8:15)
When the verb mßy/ ""mß is in the qa†6l form, expressing the present or
future, the complement verb is in the irrealis form, sometimes introduced
by the subordinating particle D, e.g.
(8) máß6x t-àmr6x} ‘We can say’ (B4:3)
In (9) a perfective past verb is followed by another perfective verb but the
latter is introduced by the subordinating particle D:
(9) bráta làn-m6ßya t-in-mú°y6lla.} ‘I could not bring back the girl.’ (A29:8)
18.3.4. ßbr ‘to dare’
A similar paratactic joining is found after perfective forms of ßbr ‘to dare’,
e.g. ßbirre °ele ‘He dared to come’, la ßbirre °ele ‘He did not dare to come’.
The examples attested in the text corpus are negated:
(1) ""áp-xa m•nna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared to speak in the
reception room.’ (A26:70)
(2) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)clause sequences941The irrealis form is also attested after the perfective past, e.g.
(3) ""áp-xa lá-ßbirre ""asêqle.} ‘Nobody dared to go up (and do) it.’ (A33:4)
18.3.5. qbl ‘to permit’
The verb qbl ‘to permit’ may be used in a similar syntactic structure. In
the following example from the text corpus it is negated:
(1) ""áw là-qbille °éli.} ‘He did not permit me to come.’ (A46:3)
18.3.6. šry II ‘to begin’
This verb is normally followed by an infinitive (§15.5.5.). When, however,
it is in a perfective past form, it is sometimes followed by a perfective form
of the verb linked to it paratactically in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
(A25:11)
(2) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
(3) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)
18.3.7. prq ‘to finish’
Similarly, the verb prq ‘to finish’ is sometimes combined together with a
verb in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) bar-príqla kúlla náše šqílla ""arz?q.} ‘After all the people had finished taking provisions . . .’ (B17:12)
18.3.8. pyš majbur ‘to become obliged’
This expression is used to express an obligation and is often prosodically
bonded with the following verb, which expresses the lexical content of
the action, e.g.
(1) páy6š májbur béna xaráya šàte.} ‘In the end it will be forced to drink.’
(A12:47)
(2) píš5le májbur ßêly5le.} ‘He had to dismount.’ (A28:33)942chapter eighteen18.3.9. Cirumstantial Clauses
When a clause is dependent on another clause by virtue of the fact that
it expresses the circumstances of the action of the other clause, this
dependence is often expressed prosodically by combining the two clauses
in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) kúlla ""•°ye ""itléy š>rá†e t-amríla qa-màlka.} ‘They had all come while having cases to present to the king.’ (A17:31)
(2) hadíya b8ye t-áx6l m•ndi kpìn5le.} ‘Now he wanted to eat something,
since he was hungry.’ (A30:11)
(3) ""u-sulámm6š doqíle lóši xa-jùlla.} ‘They would hold the hive whilst wearing a cloth.’ (B5:178)
18.3.10. Temporal Adverbial Clauses
Similarly, prosodic bonding between main clauses is often used when one
clauses supplies the temporal adverbial setting of the action of the following clause. In such cases the first clauses is idiomatically translated by
supplying a temporal particle such as ‘after’ or ‘when’, e.g.
(1) barzíwa xá‘‘a mkal‘ìwala.} ‘(After) they (the logs) had dried a little, they
would remove their bark.’ (B5:187)
(2) hadíya mkop•šla ßlèla.} ‘Now (after) they had gathered it, they went
down (to the plain).’ (A7:15)
(3) b>láwala yabíšta x6rqá x6rqá gu-qðála díya mabyênwa.} ‘(When) she swallowed a raisin, it could be seen, ring by ring in her neck.’ (A8:63)
(4) m†éle mo°7°6lle xá‘‘a mìya.} ‘(When) he came, she brought some water.’
(A22:28)
(5) hátta Gozáli b-gáne mšudr•tle lˆn °í°a.} ‘Even (when) you sent Gozali
himself, I did not come.’ (A8:94)
18.3.11. Complement of a Clause Constituent
Another context in which clauses occur in a single intonation group due
to their semantic connection is where the second clause functions as a
complement of a constituent in the first clause. In (1), for example, the
second clause should be analysed as the complement of the noun ""urxa
‘way’ (‘the way she learnt’):clause sequences943(1) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""•lla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)
This applies also to clauses that are formally marked as subordinate by
by the particle D. When these are direct complements of a verb, they are
typically in the same intonation group as the verb, e.g.
(2) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
(3) b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
(4) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)
If, however, the subordinate clause is not integrated into the main clause
as the complement of a constituent, but rather is a complement of the
clause as a whole and so is external to it, this looser relationship is sometimes expressed by putting the subordinate clause in a separate intonation
group, e.g.
(5) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you, so that
you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)
18.4. Repetition of Clauses to Mark a Discourse Boundary
Some types of repetition across clauses have been described already in
relation to the connective particles (cf. §18.1.1., §18.1.2.). A further type
of repetitive overlap across clauses is described in this section.
In narrative the narrator sometimes repeats the mention of an event that
has already been narrated before recounting the event that is sequential
to it. The informational status of the clause, therefore, may be compared
to that of a topical referent. The purpose of ‘heavy’ coding of topical
information at the front of a sentence is generally to mark some kind of
boundary in the narrative. This is, indeed, the function of the construction under discussion since it is used to signal the onset of a section. It is
a device used by the narrator to present an activity as a new event with
a degree of independence from what precedes. This is usually a result
of the subjective choice of the speaker as to how the narrative should be
staged. The function of this construction is similar to that of subordinate
‘when’–clauses (§19.3.3.) and, indeed, they are often idiomatically rendered
by supplying ‘when’ in an English translation. Examples:944chapter eighteen(1) kúlla twìre qðaléy,} mì°ela.} mì°ela,} ""áwwa rìq5le,} ß•ly5le m†ùšy6lla gáne.}
‘They all broke their necks and died. (When) they died, he fled, went
down and hid himself.’ (B18:6)
(2) xà-yoma} sìqle} l-ßˆda,} tfìqle} xa-""àrya bíye díye.} tfíqle xa-""àrya bíye díye,}
zílle †ál6b ""àrya.} ‘One day he went out hunting and a lion chanced
to come his way. (When) a lion chanced to come his way, he went
to attack the lion.’ (A27:3)
(3) qímle q6m-†arêdle.} q6m-†ar•dle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him
away. (When) he drove him away, he went back to his aunt’s house.’
(A23:32–33)
(4) zílla q6m-qa†làla} Šóš6t Xère,} q6m-m†amrála gu-""òr6t sus>wá°a ""•lt6x.} q6mm†amrála gu-""ór6t sus>wà°a,} bróna díya °èle.} ‘She went and killed Šoš6t
Xere and buried her in the horses’ manger below. (When) she buried
her in the horses’ manger, her son came back.’ (A38:3–4)
The repeated material is in some cases uttered with a different distribution
of stress either across the words of a stress group (5) or within a single
word (6):
(5) map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.} má†6t l-d-ò-qaßra,} háw6t
h•šy6r ""ína ""áyya sústa là marp•tla.} ‘She will fly you over the seven seas
and you will reach that palace. (When) you arrive at that palace, be
careful not to let that horse go.’ (A12:29)
(6) ""u-m•†y5le qam-d-o-†ùra.} m6†y7le qam-d-o-†ùra,} xirˆle,} mùjb5le.} ‘He
arrived in front of the mountain. He arrived in front of the mountain, he looked and was amazed.’ (A8:53)
In cases where long morphological variants are available, the long form
is used either in the first clause or in the repeated clause. This can be
regarded as two alternative strategies whereby a heavy morphological
form is used as a boundary marker to signal either closure or onset. In
(7) the first clause has a long form of pronominal suffix on the resultative
participle to mark closure (§15.13.5.), whereas the repeated clause has the
shorter, default form. In (8), on the other hand, the long variant of the
imperative is used in the repeated clause:
(7) ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} p°íxt6lle t9ra,} xzí°6lle bába dìya} ""u-""up-w8zīr
mênne.} ‘While there was flour on her hands, she opened the door.
She opened the door and saw her father and also the vizier who was
with him.’ (A21:26)clause sequences

house of such-and-such a man, and take away the two children.
Get rid of them.’ (A8:8)In (9)–(11) the repeated clause has more lexical material than the first
clause. This again can be viewed as a strategy of using linguistic ballast
to mark a boundary, which should be interpreted as the onset of what
follows. In (9) the repeated clause also exhibits the use of the long alternative form of the 3pl. suffix -l5y (cf. §15.12.):
(9)""í°wa xá-n>ra tàma.} kut-táwra m•xy6lle xá gu-réše dìye,} gu-be-""7ne

them they should do. They went off. The police went off at night
and took the two children from their father and mother.’ (A8:9)
18.5. Intonation Patterns
The relationship between clauses is also signalled by the pitch contours
associated with the nuclear stress in an intonation group. By means of
intonation contours the speaker conveys to the hearer a wide range of
signals, some of which belong to levels of expression that have no direct
correlations in linguistic structure, such as numerous personal attitudes.
For this reason it was decided not to mark the intonational pitch contours
in the transcription of the texts. Here we shall restrict ourselves to a
brief examination of some of the main intonational signals, with special
attention to those that mark semantic continuity and discontinuity across946chapter eighteenclauses. The semantic connection between clauses is an issue that has
been discussed in numerous places in the foregoing discussion of syntactic
structure.
We may distinguish two basic types of intonational contours that
are relevant for the present discussion, namely a contour expressing
disjunction and one expressing conjunction. Following the terminology that
is customary in the field of intonation, we may refer to these as ‘major
juncture’ and ‘minor juncture’ respectively.
18.5.1. Major Juncture
The intonation expressing major juncture is characterized by a low fall
in pitch at the end of the intonation group. There is sometimes a slight
rise in pitch on the nucleus. Any syllables occurring after the nucleus have
decreasingly lower levels of pitch. This contour is represented by the symbol . It expresses completeness and disjunction from what follows. As is
the case with many syntactic expressions of disjunction, the decision as to
where such a signal of disjunction should be placed is generally governed
by the choice of the speaker as to how he wishes to present the discourse
to the hearer. Examples:
(1) ""o-gó‰a píšle tàma. } ‘The eldest one remained there.’ (A24:5)
(2) xa-n>ßíy6t t-yánna †làlux. } ‘I’ll give you some advice.’ (A24:9)
(3) lá-""awð6t xá-mdi xéna t-la-b-dìyi. } ‘Do not do anything else without
me.’ (A24:9)
Speakers separate clauses with major juncture to express lack of sequentiality in a variety of contexts.
In (4) the major juncture is used to separate two clauses that are not
connected in temporal sequentiality, but rather are overlapping temporally.
The second clause does not complete the first so much as stand in parallel
with it, giving a supplementary description of the same event. Similarly
in (5) the second clause does not follow temporally or logically from the
first but rather elaborates on it:
(4) ""an-míya p7ši trè-q6sme. } kàli. } ‘The water will become (divided into)
two parts. It will stop.’ (A24:14)
(5) wúðuli xa-‘àra. } xzóli xa-darmána qa-""ˆni. } ‘Cure me. Find a remedy
for my eyes.’ (A24:2)clause sequences947In (6) the disjunctive prosody separates a prohibition from a following instruction, which is supplementary to the prohibition rather than
sequential to it:
(6) là-šoq6t t-kále. } máx6t ""•lle díye ta-t-""ás6q payêdle ""o-†úra. } ‘Do not let
him (the horse) stop. Strike him so that he will go up and cross over
that mountain.’ (A24:11)
When the clauses express temporally sequential events, the purpose of
the major disjuncture is to make a clear division between the two and to
signal that they are not seamlessly connected. This may coincide with a
spatio-temporal shift, as in (7) in which the arrival at the palace is separated
from the event of crossing the water in both place and time:
(7) ""u-p5ðêtla ""an-míya. } má†6t l-qáßr6t Parizàda. } ‘You should cross the
water. Then you will arrive at the palace of Parizada.’ (A24:14)
18.5.2. Minor Juncture
The intonational contour that are typically associated with minor juncture
consists of a rise in pitch on the nucleus. This is typically followed by a mid
fall on the syllables coming after the nucleus. Such a contour is represented
here by the symbol . Minor juncture contour signals incompleteness. It
is regularly used on a clausal constituent that is uttered in an intonation
group that is separate from that of the rest of the clause. This applies to
the clause initial subjects and extraposed items in (1)–(4):
(1) báxta yaqùrta, } ""i-màbra. } ‘A pregnant woman will give birth.’
(A24:13)
(2) ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya mðìta. } ‘The eldest one said
“I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
(3) ""an-š5r°† } láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila. } ‘The conditions—you must know
what they are.’ (A24:10)
(4) sùsux } ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela. } ‘Your horse—his legs have become
wounded.’ (A24:12)
Likewise, if a constituent is placed at the end of the clause in a separate
intonation group, the clause is connected to the postposed constituent by
minor juncture. This applies to (5) and (6), which have a postposed subject
and adverbial respectively:948
(5)
(6)chapter eighteen
""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
t-yáxlux xamšì dináre } kut-yàrxa. } ‘We’ll give you fifty dinars every
month.’ (A24:7)When the speech reported by the verb ‘to say’ is placed following it in a
separate intonation group, the clause with this verb regularly has minor
juncture, e.g.
(7)qím5le m•re qa-bnóne dìye: } bnòni } wúðuli xa-‘àra. } ‘He said to
his sons “My sons, cure me!” ’ (A24:2)Minor juncture is typically used in clauses that occur in non-final position
in a sequence, the final clause in the sequence being marked by a major
juncture intonational contour. The clauses connected in this way may be
temporally sequential, as in (8). The effect is to present the two events as
closely linked together. Minor juncture is commonly used in clauses containing the verb qym (9) or a verb of movement (10–11). As we have seen
in §18.3.1. and §18.3.2., these types of verbs also exhibit a tendency to
be closely bound prosodically with what follows by being combined with
a following verb in the same intonation group.
m•lxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye, } t-áwe súsa mßarßòre. } ‘He will get salt
on his legs and will screech.’ (A24:12)
(9) qímela †¬á°na t-bnóne dìye } ""u-zìlela. } ‘The three sons of his set off
and went on their way.’ (A24:3)
(10) zílela m•†ye gu-ðá mðìta. } ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya
mðìta. } ‘They travelled and arrived in a certain town. The eldest
one said “I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
(11) ""o-zóra zílle b-""ùrxa. } zílle, zílle, zìlle, } ""•šta šáwwa yomàne, } m†éle
xa-náša sàwa. } ‘The young one went on the road. He went along
for six or seven days and came upon an old man.’ (A24:7)(8)In constructions such as those described in §18.4., in which a boundary is
expressed in the discourse by repeating the content of a clause, the first
clause has major juncture and the repeated clause, which is presented as
the onset of a new section, has minor juncture, e.g.
(12) qímela ""an-tre-xéne zìle. } zílela ""an-trè. } ""ap-o-gawàya } m†éle ða-mðìta.
} ‘The other two went off. The two went off. Also the middle
one came to a town.’ (A24:5–6)clause sequences949(13) t-yánnux xámši dináre kut-yàrxa. } kut-yárxa t-yánnux xámši dinàre, }
""u-plúx m6n-d-ànna paloxáye. } ‘I shall give you fifty dinars each
month. Each month I shall give you fifty dinars, now work with
these labourers.’ (A24:5)
Clauses containing the existential particle that introduce a referent into
the discourse frequently have minor juncture. This is because such clauses
are closely connected with what follows in that they typically create the
expectation that the ensuing clauses will elaborate further on the newly
introduced referent, e.g.
(14) ""í°wa xa-màlka. } ""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘There was once a king.
He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
18.5.3. Interrogative Clauses
Interrogative clauses are uttered with a rise from a higher level of pitch
than that of minor juncture (1–3). There is a short fall on syllables after
the nucleus. The contour is represented here by the symbol . Negative interrogative clauses that function as a device for drawing attention
to preliminary background material (§18.2.1.) typically have a lower
level of pitch than the normal interrogative contour (4). To distinguish
these two levels of pitch the symbol of the lower level is qualified by the
numeral 1 whereas the symbol for the regular interrogative contour has
the numeral 2:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)mò t-óð6t? 2} ‘What will you do?’ (A24:4)
k6mà t-yátli? 2} ‘How much will you give me?’ (A24:5)
mòdila? 2} ‘What are they?’ (A24:11)
""ánna l7la dmìxe, 1} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta. } ‘While
they were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’
(A16:11)When a question is rhetorical and does not expect an answer, it may have
a low fall intonation characteristic of major juncture, e.g.
(5)m•re qá-mo là? } ‘He said “Why not?” ’ (A24:7)950chapter eighteen18.5.4. Asseverative Clauses
Clauses that are intended to make a forceful asseveration are uttered
by speakers with a very high level of pitch, higher than the interrogative pitch contour. It includes a rise and fall. This will be represented as
pitch level 3 by the symbol 3. This type of pitch is typically used, for
example, in asseverations containing the negative particle la (cf. §17.2.
and §17.7.14.2. iii):
(1) la-hóle mì°a. 3} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
(2) A: štélux ‘àyux? 2} B: la-štèli! 3} ‘A: “Have you drunk your tea?”
B: “Indeed I have drunk it!” ’CHAPTER NINETEENSYNTACTIC SUBORDINATION OF CLAUSES
19.1. Relative Clauses
Relative clauses may be attributive and modify a head nominal or they
may stand independently of a head nominal and have themselves the
status of a nominal. We shall refer to these types as attributive relative
clauses and nominal relative clauses respectively.
19.1.1. Attributive Relative Clauses
Relative clauses that have attributive function are always placed after the
nominal that they modify. They may be explicitly connected to the head
nominal by the relative particle D, which is either prefixed to the first
word of the clause or is suffixed to the end of the head nominal, e.g. kutyala t-a°e laxxa ~ kut-yal6t ""a°e laxxa ‘Every child that comes here’. When
the particle is prefix to the first word of the clause, the final /a/ vowel
of the head noun is sometimes centralized to /6/ as is the case when the
particle is suffixed to it, e.g. ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli ‘this beautiful
girl, who has fallen asleep with me’ (A26:6). The final /6/ is occasionally
elided, e.g. ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo ‘at the time that the bride came’ (B8:32). A
D particle is sometimes elided, but the final vowel of the head nominal
remains /6/ rather than /a/ as if it were still present, e.g. ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux
gáwa díya ‘the enclosure in which you threw it’ (< ""5-d5rt6t A15:18).
Constructions with the particle D may be termed syndetic relative
clauses. Attributive relative clauses may also be placed after the head
nominal asyndetically, without the particle. The distribution of syndetic
and asyndetic attributive relative clauses is conditioned to a large extent by
the definiteness of the head nominal. A distinction should also be made
between restrictive relative clauses, which limit the reference of the head
noun, and non-restrictive ones, which present supplementary information
concerning a nominal without limiting its reference. This difference in
function sometimes gives rise to distinct syntactic structures.","[977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 987, 988, 989, 990]"

Clauses expressing insistence that open with ""•lla are sometimes used
independently of a preceding main clause, e.g.
(12) kízla bíye dìye,} m•ra ""êlla gáwr6t.} ‘They tried (to persuade) him and
said “You must marry.” ’ (A16:6)
(13) m•re lá b-àlaha,} ""•lla maßl•nn6x ""àna.} ‘No, by God. I shall take you

(14) là} ""ána har-bt-àz6n.} ""•lla xazyánne xòni.} ‘No. I shall still go. I must

In (15) it is combinded with the expression of obligation g>r6g:
(15) ""êlla g8r6g ""áyya bráta gor•nna.} ‘I must marry this girl.’ (A12:55)
The construction is sometimes used in the context of oaths, e.g.
(16) la-málka màmi} hóle y•mya b-rèši.} máttu jallàde} ""•lla b-qa†êlli.} ‘Indeed
the king my uncle has sworn on my head (to execute me). He will
appoint executioners and (has sworn) he will kill me.’ (A25:36)
The particle ""6lla may be used to insist on the veracity of a factual statement, e.g.
(17) ""u-""áwwa-≥i huðáya l-gàre} ""êlla,} ""ánna dáwe ""àn6n hiw•llux.} ‘But this Jew
on the roof (said) “I insist that it was me who gave you these gold
coins.” ’ (A6:11)
Insistence on a prohibition may be expressed by using a construction
opening with ""6n-lá independently of a main clause, paralleling the use
of ""•lla to express insistence on a command, e.g.
(18) ""á-ß6pra ""íla ròxi,} ""6n-lá qa†líle ""o-táwr6t wàla,} šaqlíle ""o-ßêpra.} ‘That
sparrow is my spirit. They must not kill that wild ox and take that
sparrow.’ (A12:41)1020chapter nineteenThe insistent function of ""•lla is sometimes used to express the sense of
‘only if ’, e.g.
(19) ""ána mí°6nwa l-márya ""alàha} ""•lla t-a°yáwa báxta bà°ri,} t-azànwa.} ‘I
had sworn to the Lord God that only if a woman came after me
would I go.’ (A8:94)
An alternative way of expressing ‘only if ’ is to use the particle ""ax‘i combined with ""6n, e.g.
(20) nablánnux l-""á°‰6t bàbux,} ""áx‘i ""6n-y>ð•tla ""à°‰a.} ‘I shall take you to the
land of your father, only if you know the land.’ (A14:89)
The particle ""•lla may be used to express exclusivity also in other contexts,
including before a nominal (22–23):
(21) lí° b>jàra} ""•lla bt-àz6x.} ‘There is no alternative but that we go.’ (A8:27)
(22) w-ána hon-m•rta †la-Nozàli} ""ána l5-gáwr6n ""•lla xóna díya Gozàli.} ‘I said
to Nozali that I would only marry her brother Gozali.’ (A8:95)
(23) díya ""•lla xá-mdi dàwa b8yi.} ‘Now they want only something made
of gold.’ (B10:40)
It is used also as a clausal connective in the sense of ‘but’, ‘but rather’, e.g.
(24) ""u-‘ú b6‰-náša la-má†e-lla ""•lla b-rzáy6t gána-diya t-à°ya.} ‘Nobody can
reach her, but rather she comes of her own will.’ (A8:65)
(25) ""u-""ùp-ati p7š6t m•nn6n,} ""árpa xon>wà°6x.} ""•lla b-šaqlênna} xá°6t Mir-Zándin barxênna-llux.} ‘You also should become (one) of us and (make)
four brothers. But I must (first) take the sister of Mir Zandin to
marry her to you.’ (A26:39)
19.5.6. Non-Conditional Uses of the Particle ""6n
The particle ""6n is sometimes used outside of conditional contexts. These
include the following.
19.5.6.1. Disjunctive Particle (‘either . . . or’)
Several speakers use ""6n as a disjunctive between items. It is used either
before each item ""6n . . . ""6n (‘either. . . . or’) or only before the final item. The
items may be clauses (1–2) or constituents of clauses (3–5)syntactic subordination of clauses1021(1) ""6n-qa†l•nnux ""áyya bráta šaqlênna} ""6n-la-pál†6n m-àxxa.} ‘Either I shall kill
you and take this girl or I shall not go out from here.’ (A29:28)
(2) là-barya} gànwi} ""6n-sàlbi.} ‘They cannot steal or plunder.’ (A29:39)
(3) ""ána hon-yêmya} ""áyya bráta hon-""•°ya nablênna} ""6n-b-našù°a,} ""6n-b-xˆla,}
nabl•nna la-bàbi.} ‘I have taken an oath. I have come to take this girl
either humanely or by force to my father.’ (A29:65)
(4) xàr°a} ""áxni gu-ma°wà°a} kúll5ni j>m•xwa m-©ðàðe,} ""6n-qàša m•nn6n}
""6n-múxt6r6t mà°a,} zavr•xwa ""eð>wà°a.} ‘Afterwards, all of us in the
villages gather together, either with a priest with us or a head of
the village, and we go around (offering) festival blessings.’ (B6:13)
(5) x•lya t-heywàne} t-""•rwe ""6n-tawrà°a,} x•lya mar6x°ìle.} ‘They boil the milk
of animals, of sheep or cows.’ (B6:37)
When the particle is used before a copula clause, the copula may be
attached to it, as is the case when it has a conditional function (6), or the
copula may remain in its normal position on the predicate (7–8):
(6) ""Øx ""áw gáw‰i m-jàlde hóle zíla} lá-""6°ya l-b7°a ≥àre,} ""6n-ile-q†ìla,} ""6n-ile xìla.}
‘Oh, that husband of mine has gone out early and has not returned
home, poor man. He has either been killed or he has been eaten (by
wild animals).’ (A39:17)
(7) y-azíwa be-k yàlo.} ""6n-d-à-ma°5le.} ""6n-d-a-má°a xèt5le} y-azíwa y-atwíwa
táma be-kyàlo.} ‘They went to the house of the bride. Whether it was
in the village or in another village, they would go and sit there in
the house of the bride.’ (B5:28)
(8) š>vána modìle?} kut-náš6t ""ítle ""êrwe,} ""6n-""•rw6t xwàrela,} ""•rw6t kòmela,} yá'ni
""êzzela,} ""6n-wànela.} ‘What is a shepherd? Anybody who has small
cattle, whether they are “white small cattle” or they are “black small
cattle”, that is whether they are goats or are sheep.’ (B5:109)
19.5.6.2. Interrogative Particle
The particle ""6n is sporadically used at the front of direct polar (yes–no?)
question, e.g.
(1) ""amr•xlux ""ítl6n xá zêqqa} ràba gó‰t5la.} y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha
†úra.} rába rê˙q5le ""o-†úra.} ràba r•˙q5le.} ""•n máß6t šaqlêtla?} ‘We say to
you that we have a water-skin that is very large. We shall go up and
fetch water from that mountain over there. That mountain is very
far away. It is very far away. Can you take it there?’ (A39:9)1022chapter nineteen19.5.7. Conditionals with madam
On some occasions constructions that can be rendered into English as
conditionals have the particle madam in the protasis rather than the usual
conditional particle ""6n. The use of madam is restricted to clauses describing a situation that the speaker knows is true. For this reason the particle
in the protasis clause can usually be approprately translated also by an
factive English subordinate clause such as ‘since (it is the case that) . . .’.
The particle madam is generally connected to the following clauses by the
D subordinator, though this is omitted in some cases, e.g.
(1) mádam hàtx5la} t-áz6n †8y6n bá°6r ˙aqqù°a} ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘If (the world)
is like that, I shall go and search for what is lawful and what is
unlawful.’ (A15:5)
(2) mádam t-íw6t hàtxa} háyyo láxxa t-awð•nnux w9zīr.} ‘If you are like this,
come here and I shall make you the vizier.’ (A21:41)
(3) mádam bráti wéla b-p6lxàna} ""u-lípla p6lxàna} b8y6n t-y9ð6n} ""áwwa b6‰-náša
mòdile,} dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a.} ‘If my daughter
has become hard-working and has learnt to work, I want to know
what (kind of person) this man is, how could he have made this girl
a hard-working housewife.’ (A21:32)
(4) ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,} ""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.}
‘If he had a wife, he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’
(A17:17)
(5) madam-t-íw6t ""áyya wìð6lla kúlla,} si-m7°ili q6ßß•tt6t W7rda-w Nˆrgis.} ‘If
you have done all of this, go and bring me the story of W5rda and
N5rgis.’ (A24:35)
(6) hàyyo,} hàyyo!} madam-t-íw6t ""àti,} hàyyo!} là-""az6t.} ‘Come, come. If it is
you. Come, don’t go.’ (A24:36)
19.5.8. Conditionals with ""5-ga
Similarly a clause introduced by the adverbial ""5-ga referring to a situation
that the speaker knows is true may sometimes be rendered idiomatically
by an English conditional, e.g.
(1) ""7-g6t m6n-d-ánna hàwe,} šúla bt-áz6l l>-qàma!} ‘If there are these (gold
pieces), the job will go ahead!’ (A4:15)syntactic subordination of clauses102319.5.9. Asyndetic Conditional and Temporal Constructions
On a number of occasions the semantic relation between a series of clauses
is that of condition and consequent, but they are juxtaposed asyndetically
without a conditional particle. It is often appropriate to translate such
clauses by an English conditional sentence. They often contain verbal
forms that are characteristic of ""6n conditional constructions., e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""ána t•mm6l ""à°ena,} ""áti mxazdêtli.} ‘If I come tomorrow, you will
blame me.’ (A21:43)
""àti} díya ""á°6t gu-b7°i la-pàlx6t,} lè-yannux ""ixála.} ‘If you come now, come
to my house and do not work, I shall not give you food.’ (A21:36)
xàz6n} màß6n} t-óð6n xa-‘àra.} là-amß6n,} maqê†lu bróni,} mó t-oðèna?} ‘I
shall see whether I can find a solution. If I cannot, have my son
killed, what can I do?’ (A33:6)
mqáwl6t goràtle,} t-yálla jùlla.} ‘If you promise to marry him, he will
give back the clothes.’ (A14:83)
gúrza maxèle} ""áy bá≥6r kúlla t-aw•dla mìya.} ‘If he struck with his club,
he would make all of that town turn to water.’ (A52:15)
l7le jyàra,} š>y•tle b-gùda.} ‘If he does not pass water, throw him
against the wall.’ (A30:40)
kút-dana ""a-ß•pra mìtle,} ""7-ga ""ana-mˆ°6n.} ‘If ever that sparrow dies,
then I shall die.’ (A12:41)
t•mm6l y•mmi mìtla,} p7š6x ""ána-w bàxti.} ‘If my mother dies tomorrow,
we shall remain, myself and my wife.’ (A21:42)
mu°yále B•lb6l Hazàr,} p7ša kàl°i.} ‘If he brings B6lb6l Hazar back,
she will become my daughter-in-law.’ (A8:34)Such asyndetic conditional constructions are commonly found with the
verb ‘to want’ in the protasis, e.g.
(10) b8y6t ""àxl6t,} xùl!} ‘If you want to eat, eat!’ (A14:59)
(11) ""•rwe hòla gu-†úra.} b9y6t,} s5-mkàp6šla!} ‘The sheep are in the mountains. If you want, go and gather them up!’ (A10:4)
(12) b8ya pˆša,} p7ša ""áy ""àxxa,} b-šóp6t bròn6n} t-óya mal•k°a b-šópi ""íman-t""ána mˆ°6n.} ""u-b8ya d7‰a l-b7°6t bába dìya,} matt•nna xá-ga xèta,} ""àna
m>d6‰•nna.} ‘If she wants to stay, let her stay here in the place of
our son and she will be queen in my place when I die. But, if she
wants to return to her father’s house, I shall put her again (on a
camel) and return her.’ (A4:39)1024chapter nineteen(13) b8y6t b9y6t.} là-b>y6t,} hóle Íaddàm si-škì.} ‘If you want it, you want
it (fine). If you do not want it, there is Saddam, go and complain
(to him).’ (B1:22)
Such asyndetic conditional constructions generally have a rising intonation contour in the intonation group of the first clause, which typically
expresses conjunction with what follows, e.g.
(14) súsux b8ye t-kàle, } là-šoq6t t-kále. } ‘If your horse wants to stop, do
not let him stop.’ (A24:11)
In (15) an asyndetic conditional is followed by a negative alternative condition that has the conditional particle, demonstrating the equivalence
between the asyndetic and syndetic constructions:
(15) m5°êtta-lli,} šoq•nnux t-àz6t.} ""ên-la,} là-šoq6n t-azítu.} ‘If you bring her
here, I shall let you go. If not, I shall not let you go.’ (A12:21)
In (16) the presentative particle ""ina is used to introduce a protasis that
lacks the conditional particle:
(16) ""ína ""ánna xon>wà°i,} ""arbì xon>wá°i,} kúšš6t magúr6t xà,} páy6š ""úmri tmàni
š•nne.} ‘If each year you marry off one of these forty brothers of
mine, I’ll be eighty years old (before I marry).’ (A12:1)
Conditional type constructions are sometimes expressed by imperative
clauses, e.g.
(17) la-xzì} ""u-la-x†ì.} ‘If you do not see, you will not sin.’ (D2:49)
(18) wí mbaqràna,} t-áw6t yaðùwa.} ‘If you are inquisitive, you shall be
knowledgeable.’ (D2:11)
Expressions of a wish that appear unlikely to be fulfilled (‘if only . . .!)
use the qa†6lwa verbal form, which is characteristic of protases denoting
an improbable situation in the future, e.g.
(19) xuš-mˆ°6n} bas-xá°i Nozáli xazênwala.} ‘Let me die, but, if only I could
see my sister Nozali.’ (A8:57)syntactic subordination of clauses1025An asyndetic conditional may lack verbal forms, especially in proverbial
contexts, e.g.
(20) dárta l-yòma,} ""•rwe gu-gòma.} dárta l-sèra,} ""•rwe l-†èra.} ‘If the sun has
a halo, the sheep will be in the basement stable. If the moon has
a halo, the sheep will be in the noon sun.’ (D2:15)
(21) t8ra dwìra} q8da wìra.} ‘If the door is closed, trouble passes by.’
(D2:47)
Asyndetic constructions are used also when a consequent follows a clause
expressing a situation that is presupposed to be true and so has the function of a temporal ‘when’–clause, e.g.
(22) bábi mày6°,} ""ána bt-áw6n málka šòpe.} ‘When my father dies, I shall
be king in his place.’ (A14:88)
(23) t-ámr6x háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a} . . . ""aw-ßále táma mrap•xle
xáwla b-réše dìye} ""u-""áyya q>páxta matt•xxa r6š-d-o-t8r6t gêppa.} ‘We shall
say “Come Karim, go down into this conduit.”. . . When he goes
down there, we shall throw the rope onto his head and shall put
this cover onto the opening of the cave.’ (A14:16)
(24) ""à-dana} ""áyya nablàlux,} map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.}
má†6t l-d-ò qáßra,} háw6t h•šy6r ""ína ""áyya sústa là marp•tla.} ‘She will
take you, she will fly you over the seven seas and you will reach
that palace. When you arrive at that palace, be careful not to let
that horse go.’ (A12:29)
19.6. Concessive Constructions
The syntactic expression of concession is rarely found in the text corpus.
Where this occurs, it tends to take the form of a protasis clause introduced
by phrases denoting literally ‘even if ’ (""ap-""6n / ""up-""6n, ham-""6n), e.g.
(1)
(2)""úp-""6n-iwa xayú°a pšì††a,} ""ánna náše ráb5wa xêðye.} ‘Although the life
was simple, people were very happy.’ (B15:14)
hám-""6n wídle hátxa ""àp-aw,} ""áp ""axni-xìl6xwale táwre díye.} ‘Although he
did such a thing, (we should take into account that that) we had
eaten his ox.’ (A7:20)1026chapter nineteenNote also the use of the Arabic conditional concessive w>-law in (3):
(3) w8-law t-ín ""anna-xámša š•nne zíla b-dùnye,} n•mu lat-ðà""6lli?} ‘Although I
have been away in the world for these five years, don’t you know me
any more?’ (A12:65)
In these sentences, despite the conditional structure, the truth of the protasis is not in question. The concessive sense is that the situation described
in the subordinate clauses might lead one to expect that the proposition
of the main clause would be false but, in fact, this is not the case. A pure
conditional ‘even if ’ construction is related, in that it indicates that the
situation of the main clause is not expected to follow from the condition
but nevertheless will do so. The difference from a concessive construction
is that the truth of the protasis is not certain. There are various ways of
expressing pure conditional ‘even if ’–clauses, including clauses introduced
by a conditional and one of the inclusive particles ""ap/""up, ham and -≥i, e.g.
(4) bnáya gúda ""u-dráya r>ß?ß,} tá-t ""áp-""6n maxíle màdfa'} t-là-tal6xwa gúda.} ‘He
built the wall and put lead into it, so that, even if it was hit by artillery, it would not be destroyed.’ (A11:13)
(5) hám-""6n yaw•tli zùze,} lè-y-a°6n.} ‘Even if you give me money, I shall
not come.’
(6) ""6n-háwe dàwa-≥i} ""áxni t-yaw•xla xa-b-†¬à°a ""•lle díye.} ‘Even if it is gold,
we shall give him threefold (if it is lost).’ (A7:10)
In (7) it is expressed by a simple ""6n clause, but this is given prominence
on a prosodic level by being uttered with a high pitch level:
(7) là-b-alaha,} lá q5ß•nne rèšux,} ""6n-qa†lêtli.} ‘No, by God. I shall not cut
(the hair on) your head, even if you kill me.’ (A29:6)
A concessive relationship sometimes exists between clauses that are linked
paratactically. In such cases the grounds for the reversed expectation,
equivalent to the subordinate ‘although’ clause, is usually conjoined after
the other clause with the connective particle w, e.g.
(8) málka krìble} ""u-b-gáne málka mír5wa ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.}
‘The king became angry, although the king himself had said “if I
have a daughter I shall give her to your son.” ’ (A25:8)syntactic subordination of clauses
(9)1027píšla d6≥mênne,} ""u-""áni là-x6zye ©ðáðe,} ""u-là-mßu°e hátxa m•ndi.} ‘So, they
became enemies, although they had not met each other and had
not said (to each other) any such a thing.’ (B19:2)Concession may be expressed by an asyndetic conditional type construction, e.g.
(10) tú póìla,} mßáw6° d°s.} ‘Sit crooked (= even though you sit crooked),
tell the truth.’ (D2:60)The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of BarwarHandbook of Oriental Studies

time indeed are not a little.’ (A14:63)
yába ""an-""èmma dàwe,} xu-là mbaqrêt6lli.} ‘Well, do not ask me about
those hundred gold coins.’ (A14:65)
""àna t-ásq6n,} xu-là ""axèlli,} xu-lˆle ""árya.} ‘I shall go up (and ride the
horse), surely it will not eat me, surely it is not a lion.’ (A12:63)
xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man (literally: Not only I
am a man).’ (A26:79)It is also frequently used in negative questions, again often generally with
remonstrating force, e.g.
(9)xu-l7wa †axxána bròn-†axxanˆ°a?} ‘Was he really a miller, son of a
miller woman?’ (A32:28)
(10) xzéli xa-xèlma dìya,} xu-l7wa xêlma?} xèzwa šk9ra wéwa.} ‘I have just
now had a dream. Was it (really) a dream? It was a clear vision.’
(A2:6)
(11) xo-lat-mírta xà-m6ndi?} ‘Did you not say something? (= surely you
said something?)’ (A26:34)
(12) bábi tèmm6l ""áyya mðíta xu-kùmta-wawa?} ‘Father, was this town
not black yesterday? (= surely this town was black yesterday)’
(A4:36)
(13) xu-l5w6t l-xoðux rxima? ‘Are you alone not loved? (= surely you alone
are loved) (C2:62)
It is attested in positive non-interrogative clauses that express deontic
intention (14) or that are apodosis clauses in conditional constructions
(15–16):
(14) maníx6n ""èdl5le làxxa.} xu-mbádla q7m6n ßàl6n.} ‘I shall rest tonight here.
In the morning I shall (surely) get up and go down.’ (A31:2)
(15) ""6n-š8r6† díyi q6m-y>ðêtla,} xo-b-gawrànnux.} ‘If you know (the answer

it is me who has come to you.’ (A26:4)
It is occasionally used in a positive interrogative clause that is remonstrating or expostulatory in tone.
(17) mèra mòt ""è°ya xo-bábi?} mère ""ámti ""è°y6n masqênn6x.} ‘She said “Why
have you come, my dear?” He said “Aunt, I have come to take
you up (to your home).” ’ (A52:9)
(18) gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘(Why) should I have been finished off by your stupid club (literally: the club of your behind)?!’
(A52:17)CHAPTER EIGHTEENCLAUSE SEQUENCES
18.1. Connective Particles
18.1.1. w
When functioning as a clausal conjunction, the particle w may be attached
as a clitic either to the initial or final word of a clause. It is realized as ""u- (<
*""uw) when in contact with a consonant at the beginning of a word, e.g.
(1) ""áti tú-tiwa làxxa.} ""u-súsi páy6š làxxa} ""u-""ána bráta masq•nna be-bába dìya.}
‘You stay here and my horse will stay here and I shall take the girl up
to the house of her father.’ (A29:41)
(2) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yaw•lla yalêx°a ""•lli.} ‘The young man
whom she loved has come and has given me her scarf.’ (A4:24)
Occasionally, the speaker attaches a particle as a suffix to the end of one
clause and then repeats it as a prefix to the following clause, e.g.
(3) mattíla gu-qußárta mbašlìla-w} ""u-yátwi ""àxli.} ‘They put them in a pan and
cook them, then sit down to eat them.’ (A1:3)
(4) mxúll6lla pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘He washed his face and went to
his work.’ (A21:16)
The particle is used to express various types of semantic connection
between clauses. In most cases such semantic connections may also be
expressed by juxtaposing clauses asyndetically without the explicit linguistic
expression of the connection in the form of the connective particle.
In narrative the particle is used to join clauses that express sequential
events. The majority of sequential clauses in narrative are joined asyndetically. The usual strategy is to use the particle before the final clause
of a chain of events. In this respect, therefore, it is a device for marking
sections of discourse that are presented as expressing closely cohering
events, e.g.","[945, 946, 947, 948]"
"the syntax of verbs705The basic function of the infinitive compound construction is to express
progressive aspect, i.e. it denotes an activity that is taking place at the
present moment but is not necessarily a permanent, habitual property of
the subject of the verb.
In positive clauses the deictic or enclitic copula may be used with the
infinitive. The copula may also be omitted altogether. In principle these
three different constructions are used by the speaker to endow the clause
with varying degrees of communicative salience. This salience scale may
be represented as follows, in which the construction with the deictic copula
is highest in salience and the form with no copula is lowest:
hole q†ala> q†al5le>q†alaIn negative clauses only two degrees of communicative salience are
expressed, one with the negative copula and one with the negative particle la alone:
l5le q†ala> la q†alaThe degree of salience depends on various factors. One consideration is
the factivity of the proposition. Clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions are high in communicative salience in that the speaker is committed
to its factuality. Non-factive propositions do not involve such commitment
and are low in communicative salience. This is reflected by the fact that
the deictic copula is normally used with the infinitive in conversation
when the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to an activity that
exists in the current speech situation, e.g. hole °aya ‘He is coming’. In interrogative clauses, on the other hand, the enclitic copula is used, e.g. °ay5le?
‘Is he coming?’ In negative main clauses there is no formal distinction
between assertive and interrogative propositions: l5le °aya ‘He is not coming’, l5le °aya? ‘Is he not coming?’ Examples from the text corpus:
(1) hóla ßláya r6š-""ˆna.} ‘She is going down to the spring.’ (A26:40)
(2) hon-wáða ""ixàla.} ‘I am making food.’ (A21:27)
(3) hóla dwáqa nàše.} ‘They are seizing people.’ (A25:80)
(4) ""áti hot-wáða xákma šulàne} báxta m6n-gáw‰a hot-šqàl6lla} ""u-hot-baróx6lla
l-gànux.} ‘You are doing (bad) things, you are taking a woman from
her husband and wedding her to yourself.’ (A25:81)
(5) dúnye hóla ràya.} ‘It is raining.’ (A26:46)
(6) †8y6t xòn6x?} ‘Are you searching for your brother?’ (A8:64)
(7) hár-dwaq6t rêqqi?} ‘Are you still insisting?’ (A40:4)706
(8)
(9)chapter fifteen
""u-""èdyo ""áti lat-wáða b-xàbri.} ‘Today you are not doing as I said (you
should).’ (A22:43)
lat-mtaxmóne m6n-nàše?} ‘Are you not thinking of the people?’
(A25:60)Another factor that contributes to communicative salience is the actionality of the verb. Verbs that have a non-dynamic actionality, which express
mental processes rather than perceptible activities, exhibit a greater tendency to have the enclitic copula when being used with progressive aspect
than do verbs with a dynamic actionality, with which the deictic copula
is used to a greater degree, e.g.
(10) b-xšáw6n gáw‰i °èle.} ‘I think my husband has returned.’ (A39:18)
(11) ""ana-txár6n y-a°7wa xo-tú°a óùwa.} ‘I remember they would come (and
sit) under the smooth mulberry tree.’ (B5:203)
(12) ""ána xzáy6n ""an-maymúne . . . hóla xál6lla q†àl6lla.} ‘I see that they are
eating and killing the monkeys.’ (A14:52)
(13) zdàl6x.} ‘We are afraid.’ (A14:40)
(14) pšàm6n rába.} ‘I am very sorry.’ (A1:11)
(15) ""ána mštawhór6n m-bnòni.} ‘I am proud of my children.’
The degree of communicative salience also depends on the nature of the
grammatical subject. In some expressions with impersonal subjects the
infinitive is used without a copula. This applies to the verb m-byn ‘to
appear’, e.g.
(16) mabyóne †úra gu-‘ól ramàn5le.} ‘It seems it is a high mountain in the
countryside.’ (A8:70)
(17) mabyóne ""ì°-xa-m6ndi gu-qèßß6t.} ‘It appears that there is something in
the story.’ (A4:18)
Note also the regular omission of the copula on the infinitive in meteorological expressions such as dunye raya ‘It is raining’ or raya talga ‘It is
snowing. The grammatical subject dunye (literally: ‘the world’) refers to
the general situation.
For some of the verbs expressing mental processes the qa†6l form is
often used to express the progressive aspect rather than the infinitive
construction. This applies to the verbs by ‘to want’, yð"" ‘to know’, zd""/zdl
‘to fear’, ßbr ‘to dare’, mßy / ""mß ‘to be able’ and xzy ‘to see’ (§15.1.1.4.).
The infinitive construction is used in some circumstances to express thethe syntax of verbs707progressive, but its distribution differs with each verb. It is rarely used at
all with by ‘to want, to like’. With zd"" ‘to fear’ and xzy ‘to see’ it is used
interchangeably with the qa†6l form. With the verbs yð"", and mßy there is
a tendency to use it with negated forms of the verb rather than positive
forms. Examples from the text corpus:
(18) hon-b9y6llux,} t-amrênnux.} ‘I like you so I shall tell you.’ (A14:78)
(19) lˆla b8y6lle?} ‘Doesn’t she want it?’ (A30:32)
(20) ""ána ""êllux-in zdá""a.} ‘I am afraid for you.’ (B9:27)
(21) l5n-zdá""a ""ap-d6ndêk°a.} ‘I am not afraid, even a little.’ (B9:17)
(22) xzáy6t "">náha naše-t-íla ráqa bà°ri?} ‘Do you see those people who are
running after me?’ (A7:17)
(23) l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
(A17:2)
(24) làn-ða""a l7k5la zílta.} ‘I do not know where she has gone.’ (A26:11)
(25) lát-ða""a ""o-""ˆnile?} ‘Do you not know who that is?’ (B15:81)
(26) lán-mßaya jwàja.} ‘I cannot move.’ (A24:2)
(27) lán-mßaya mattánna b-""ìði.} ‘I cannot put it on my hand.’ (A26:21)
A further factor that affects the communicative salience of the infinitive
construction is its information status. This is reflected in the tendency for
the enclitic copula rather than the deictic copula to be used when the
verbal form is low in information value and the main information focus
is on its complement. This is seen in (28) in which the verb xðár6n ‘I am
going around, I am searching’ in the answer to the question is presupposed to be known to the hearer, the main point of the utterance being
the complement ‘after my sustenance’, which indicates the purpose of
the bear’s action:
(28) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” ‘By God, I’m
going around (searching) after my sustenance.’ (A20:1)
The compound infinitive is used to express a continuing situation that has
been in existence for a specified period of time. Such constructions are
translated by the English present perfect, e.g.
(29) ""u-""ána ""anna-šawwá-š6nne hon-°àya.} ‘I have been travelling (literally:
coming) for these (last) seven years.’ (A37:17)708chapter fifteen15.4.2.3. Function in Narrative
The infinitive construction is used in narrative discourse. In such contexts
the infinitive has either the deictic, the enclitic copula or the copula is
omitted altogether.
When the deictic copula is used with the infinitive in narrative contexts,
the construction generally has its usual progressive sense. Its function is
to express an event that is in progress and overlaps temporally with an
adjacent punctual event. It is negated in the usual way by the negative
copula. The copula takes the past time reference of the adjacent narrative
as its deictic centre. The construction may be placed after the verb(s) with
which it overlaps temporally. It may have the same subject referent as the
preceding verb (1–2) or a different subject referent (3–5), e.g.
(1) plí†5le zíl5le hóle gašòqe.} ‘He went out, went off, watching.’ (A22:24)
(2) zílle kléle xóðe t>màha.} har-hóle xyára b-ó-Äab6t ""6ngl6znàya.} hóle zdà""a.}
‘He went to stand alone far away. He kept looking at that English
officer. He was afraid.’ (B17:13)
(3) sìqt5la,} ""o-pà‰a} hóle mbarbòre,} har-mbarbòre,} l7le klàya.} ‘She went up,
while the lamb bleated and bleated, incessantly.’ (A34:28)
(4) ""è°y5le xá-naša xèna,} lwíša lwíšta smòqta,} súsa smòqa,} rúmxa smòqta.} b-l7le
rúmxe díye hóla mxáya kizêkke,} ma-t-íle ""o-náša ràba x5làna.} ‘Another man
came, dressed in red clothing, with a red horse, a red spear. In the
night his spear was giving off sparks, so powerful was that man.’
(A12:9)
(5) ""u-murízela mbádla jàlde} síqela ""6st6qbàl t-màlka,} xéna ""ax-t-óði ""6st6qbàl
t-màlke,} b-iqàra-w} ""áyya hóla mparòje,} káza xyára hàtxa} ta-t-xazyále †líba
dìye,} lˆla xzay6lle.} ‘They lined up in the early morning and went up
to receive the king, as they (customarily) receive kings, with honour,
while she was watching, peering like this to see her betrothed, but
she does not see him.’ (A4:35)
The construction with the deictic copula is used to express an event that
is discovered to be in progress on the arrival on the scene of a character
in the narrative, e.g.
(6) ßêly5le} ""ína M8mo-w Zìne} hóla nšáqa ©ðàðe.} ‘He came down and (found)
M>mo and Zine kissing each other.’ (A26:46)
(7) ""ína xazèla} Zíne-w M9mo} hóla mê-©ðaðe mßawó°e.} ‘He sees Zine and
M>mo while they were speaking with one another.’ (A26:57)the syntax of verbs709The activities may be a sequential series of events that are not all existing simultaneously, but rather the overall event expressed by the series of
individual events is presented as temporally overlapping with the main
narrative, e.g.
(8)""ítwale xa-xurzàya,} b7°e díye šètt6t mà°a-wewa.} šèmme díye Bè≥6m-wewa.}
q6m-xazéle xále díye Rust8mo zàla.} mère xáli lˆk5t zála?} mère ""áw lˆle šúlux.}

hóle zdáy6lle bar-ðá-got6t dúnye.} Rust8mo mêre} xwàrza,} lá-wuð
hàtxa.} ‘He had a nephew, whose house was at the bottom of the
village. His name was Be≥6m. He saw his uncle Rustam going
off. He said “Uncle, where are you going?” He said “That is not
your business.” What was Be≥6m doing? He was holding the top
of a poplar tree and bending it down, young children were coming and going up the poplar, he was letting the top of the poplar
go, the poplar was springing up and he was flinging the young
children in all directions. Rustam said “Nephew, don’t do that.” ’
(A29:15–17)The infinitive construction with a deictic copula may denote an ongoing event that overlaps temporally with a resultant state expressed by a
resultative participle, e.g.
(9)""ánna ßàli} ""ína mò ßáli!} hóla sus>wà°a} jêmye b-réše díye} wáða hêlma} bréše dìye.} ‘They went down but what (a surprise when) they went
down. The horses were gathered over him, blowing onto him.’
(A25:13)
(10) hóle l-5-gòt-hòd6x,} dèrya ða-kùlla,} dmíxa tàma,} mu†6lya-g yáne dìye.} ""áni hóla
wáða tàgbir.} ‘He was on the other side. He had put up a mosquito
net and was lying there, pretending to be asleep, while they were
making a plan.’ (A30:42)
The construction with the deictic copula is used in a section of discourse
that presents a preliminary section that provides the background against
which a following series of punctual events in the foreground of the narrative take place. In (11), for example, the forms hóla nšàq6lle and hóla spára
occur in a section of discourse that sets the scene for the main foreground710chapter fifteenevent of the passage, namely that one of the angels sneezed because of
the soot. It is noteworthy that the resultative participles in this preliminary
background section also have the deictic copula (§15.4.1.3.):
(11) ""o-yála zóra hóla mútt6lle be-pàlga.} ""áy hóla nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,}
xpáq6lle gu-ßádra dìya.} ""u-yáw6lle †la-bábe dìye.} ""áp-aw nšàq6lle,} nšàq6lle,}
nšàq6lle.} maláxe holá-""6°ye tíwe l-kàwe.} hóla spára l-kàwe,} tá-t ""ím6t

sobá°6t kêsl6n,} bux5rìyewa.} síq5le xákma m6n-d-ò-š6mra,} wír5le gu-naxír6t
xa-m-malàxe.} ""u-wíð5le pê°yo!} tpì°5le.} ‘They put the small child in
the middle. She is kissing and kissing and kissing him and hugging him to her breast. Then she gives him to his father. He also
kisses and kisses and kisses him. The angels have come and have
sat by the window. They are waiting by the window for the time
to finish, for them to put down the child so that they could take
away their soul. There were stoves in our community that were
smoke ducts. Some of the soot went up and entered the nose of
one of the angels. He went “achoo!” He sneezed.’ (A4:58–60)
The infinitive construction is often used in narrative with a perfective
aspect to express an event that is sequential to what precedes. In such cases
the infinitive generally has the enclitic copula or the copula is omitted
altogether. Aspect, therefore, is a further factor that conditions the type
of copula marking on the construction.
The copula is typically omitted in a chain of clauses expressing closely
knit events after the subject of the verb chain has been identified by the
copula in the first clause. The copula is used when there is a change in
subject referent. This can be seen in examples (12)–(14) below. It should
be noted that the infinitive with a 3rd person enclitic copula followed by
a 3rd person pronominal suffix is identical in form to the equivalent construction without the copula (e.g. q†al6lle < q†al5le + -6lle or q†ala + -6lle). The
presence of the copula cannot, therefore, be discerned in these forms.

He killed also her. He went down. He had a servant. He handed
over his horse to the servant. He entered his tent and slept until
morning. In the morning they got up . . . They said “Wake Barz6kko!
For how long will he sleep?” They woke him . . . and went on their
way. They went a long way and arrived at an orchard. . . . Another
man arrived.’ (A12:6–9)
On some occasions a chain of clauses opens with an infinitive without the
copula when the subject is identifiable from the context and the opening
clause is closely connected semantically with what precedes. This is the
case, for example, in (15), in which the infinitive chain begins after direct
speech:
(15) hállule xa-sùsa.} tèmm6l mbádla ""àz6l.} šqála dárt-yoma xà-susa} táwa xáße
díye zàla.} ‘ “Give him a horse. Let him go tomorrow morning.” ’
The next day he took a horse, sat on its back and went off.’
(A12:59–60)
In some tightly knit verb sequences two infinitives are juxtaposed with
the copula on the second one, reflecting the fact that they are treated
as a single unit. This is attested where the first verb is qym (16) or a verb
of movement (17), or where two verbs of similar meaning are juxtaposed (18):
(16) qyáma sàq5la.} ‘They rise and go up.’ (A13:1)
(17) ráqa °ày5le.} ‘He runs and comes back.’ (A29:50)712chapter fifteen(18) ‘ar‘óre ""u-ßráx5la ë6nn6kˆra} ‘She screams and cries all around.’
(A51:15)
We should include here the use by narrators of the infinitive form mára
without a copula at various points in the text. The literal meaning of this is
‘It says’, the subject being the story itself. It is sequential to what precedes,
in that it marks an advance of the narrative. The narrator typically inserts
this formula at the beginning of new episodic sections, especially where
there is a change in spatio-temporal location. It is more idiomatically
translated into English by a discourse connective such as ‘now’, e.g.
(19) mára yóm6t trè} ""ay-là xílla.} ‘Now the next day she did not eat.’
(A21:14)
(20) mára qìm5le} qédamta híw5le xàbra.} ‘Now, the next day he gave word.’
(A26:45)
(21) mára ßèly5le r6š-""ˆna.} ""áw ""u-súse díye ßèlyela r6š-""ˆna,} xèzy6lla xákma
baxtá°a tàma.} ‘Now, he went down to the spring. He and his horse
went down to the spring. He saw some girls there.’ (A26:23)
(22) mára qím5le ""è°ya síqa l-gàre.} ‘Now, he came and he went up onto
the roof.’ (A26:40)
(23) mára Qára Té≥din zìl5le,} yíw6lla ""íðe gu-""íð6t M9mo.} ‘Now, Qara Te≥din
went and put his hand in the hand of M>mo.’ (A26:50)
On some occasions an infinitive construction that functions as a narrative
present with a perfective aspect has a deictic copula. In such cases the
intention of the speaker is to draw particular attention to the event in
question for some reason. The construction sometimes expresses an event
that was unexpected as a sequel to the preceding event. In (24) and (25),
for example, the speaker is astounded by what another character in the
narrative said after the event that is reported in the preceding clause. The
event of the horse bolting in (26) is also a sudden, unanticipated event. In
(27) the deictic copula signals the extraordinary action of the hero, which
ordinary men would not have been expected to carry out.
(24) ""è°y6x xa-néra benà°6n} hóle màra} bábi t-óð6xle gêšra.} mèri m-7ka

to cross over!’ (A17:9)

‘All those who went down there could not defeat him and he killed
them. Rustam was a mighty warrior.’ (A29:60)
The deictic copula is also found where the narrator wishes to express some
kind of boundary in the narrative. This may coincide with a shift in scene
and subject referent. In (28), for example, the narrator shifts attention to
the character Be≥6m at a different location in the village. The chain of
sequential clauses recounting his activities opens with an infinitive with a
deictic copula. Subsequent events in the scene that are expressed by the
infinitive construction have the enclitic copula or zero copula. In (29) the
attention shifts to the character Zine in a different location from that of
the preceding narrative. The adverbial ""axxa ‘over here’ is used by the
narrator to indicate a shift in scene. The clause expressing the opening
event of this scene has a deictic copula (hola †laba). The following clause,
which can be considered to be an elaboration of the first, also has the
deictic copula (hola mara). In (30) the clause with the deictic copula coincides with a change in subject. This clause may also be interpreted as the
resumption of the main narrative foreground, the two preceding clauses
being a preliminary background section. In (31) the speaker narrates the
events of a dream. The deictic copula is used to mark the crossing of
the bridge as a boundary in the discourse, presenting it as the onset of a
chain of clauses that constitute a distinct overall event from what precedes.
The clause is also presented as a new section of direct speech. Similarly
in (32) the speaker uses the deictic copula to present the series of clauses
narrating the second attempt to fire the bullets as a separate overall event
from what precedes.

it away, then put in another one, but also that one comes out (as
a blank) with a bang. We point it at her back to kill her, but the
bullet comes out (as a blank) with a bang.’ (B9:21)
It is relevant to note here that the narrative formula ‘it (the story) says’
is sometimes used with the deictic copula at the beginning of the story,
whereas in the body of the narrative it is used without a copula (mara),
e.g.
(33) hóla màra:} ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘It says: There was a king . . .’ (A1:1–2)
Another context in which the deictic copula is used when the infinitive
construction has perfective aspect is where the construction expresses an
event that is off the main narrative line and provides background information. This event is not necessarily sequential to what precedes. In (34)the syntax of verbs715and (35), for example, the construction with the deictic copula clarifies
the identity of the speaker:
(34) zílle mêre}—""áwwa ’ixàlo hóle mára}—zílle mêre} málka ""áti har-t-yàtli
brátux?} ‘He went and said—it is ’ixalo who says this—he went
and said “King, will you still give me your daughter?” ’ (A25:24)
(35) mère ""ána mò,} xo-là p7š6n š>vána-llux.} Fàrxo hóle mára.} mère ""ána bt-àzena.}
‘He (Farxo) said “What am I? I shall not become a shepherd for
you”—Farxo says (this). He said “I shall go.” ’ (A25:32)
15.4.2.4. Habitual Function
On some occasions the infinitive construction expresses an activity that
is of habitual recurrence but may not necessarily be taking place at the
time of speech. It is used to express an iterative rather than a permanent
durative situation. This differs from the ( ""i-)qa†6l(wa) form, which may
express either an iterative or a permanent situation. The iterative function
can be considered to be an extension of the perfective narrative present
function described above, which would be appropriate to describe each
individual occurrence of the iterated situation.10 It is relevant to note
that when the construction has this function, the infinitive is occasionally
replaced by the verbal noun, which expresses a single occurrence of an
action (§15.6.3.).
The iterative events may be presented as sequential to one another.
In such cases the copula, if it is not attached to some other item in the
clause, is usually cliticized to the infinitive or omitted altogether, as is the
case with the perfective narrative present usage, e.g.
(40) bár hàd6x,} bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le
qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ‘After the woman becomes official there,
that is she enters the house, the priest comes and ties the band.’
(B5:44)
(41) ""íman-t-ile náša mq>ròne} mjaròbele} qa-t-xáze xayú°a biš-spày.} ‘When
somebody grows up, he tries to find a better life.’
This iterative function of the infinitive construction expressing the perfective present is indeed found in narrative discourse itself, e.g.","[743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754]"

"444chapter thirteen13.3.20. šawp-, šop- ‘instead, in the place of ’
This is the noun šawpa ‘place, trace’ used adverbially. When used with this
adverbial function the diphthong is frequently contracted to /o/ (§2.4.2.).
It is combined with the following nominal in an annexation relation, e.g.
dáx páy6š málka šáwp6t bròni?} ‘How will he become king in place of my son?’
(A8:4), mútt6lle šópe dìye} ‘He put him in his place’ (A25:51), hálli b•sra šóp6t
lêxma} ‘Give me meat instead of bread’, šóp6 d-áw ‘instead of him’. It takes
pronominal suffixes, e.g. šópux ‘instead of you’, šóp6n ‘instead of us’.
13.3.21. t-la ‘without’
Examples: t-la-zùze} ‘without money’ (A24:23), t-lá mìya} ‘without water’
(B5:14), t-lá m5xòlta} ‘without food’ (B5:114), t-lá marăwà°5le o-márga?} ‘Is the
meadow without owners?’ (A25:60). It is connected to a following demonstrative pronoun by the subordinating particle D, e.g. t-lá d-o-náša ‘without
that man’, t-lá d-áw ‘without him’. Pronominal suffixes are expressed by
combining it with the independent genitive particle, e.g. t-lá díyi ‘without
me’, t-lá díyux ‘without you’. Occasionally the preposition b- is placed
before the genitive particle, e.g. t-la-b-dìyi ‘without me’ (A24:9).
13.3.22. la-/ta- ‘to, for’, object marker
Either of the two variant forms of the preposition, la- or ta-, are used
before nominals, e.g. maláxa m•re la-ràbb6n} ‘The angel said to the monk’
(A15:7), áwwa q ìlle la- árya} ‘He killed the lion’ (A11:1), híw6lla qu •rta
ta-màlla} ‘They gave the pot to the mullah’ (A5:8), d• a ta- a°rˆy} ‘They
returned to their land’ (A4:27).
They are connected to demonstrative pronouns and the interrogative
pronoun 5ni by the subordinating particle D, e.g. mtúny6lla q6 •tte kúlla
la-d-o-sàwa} ‘He told all his story to the old man’ (A14:76), pálga la-d-áy
u-pálga la-d-àw} ‘half for her and half for him’ (A4:46), bron6t-málka m•re
ta-d-an-wăzìre} ‘The son of the king said to the ministers’ (A14:40), o-bába
sáwa m•re ta-d-àni} ‘The old timer said to them’ (A14:85), la-d-7ni? ‘for
whom?’
Pronominal suffixes are added to the base form lal-, e.g. lále ‘to him’,
lálux ‘to you (ms.)’, láli ‘to me’, etc. Forms with the third person suffixes
may be extended by the independent genitive pronoun, e.g. lále díye ‘to
him’, lála díya ‘to her’. The form ta- may be combined with pronominalparticles445suffixes by means of the independent genitive particle, e.g. ta-dìyi} ‘to me’
(A25:84).
13.3.23. xo-, xo°- ‘under’
This is generally attached directly to the following word in the short form
xo-, e.g. xo-kosì°e} ‘under his hat’ (A23:6), xo-réša dìya} ‘under her head’
(A24:17), xo-ðà ilána,} ‘under a tree’ (A35:12). Occasionally the longer form
xo°- is used, e.g. áxni xo°-tagbárt6t màlk6x} ‘We are under the administration
of the king’ (A8:80).
The subordinating particle D is sporadically used to connect the preposition to a nominal without a demonstrative, e.g. xó-t má°a ‘under the
village’. It is regularly used before a demonstrative, e.g. xo-d-áwwa jùlla}
‘under this cloth’ (A25:49), xo-d-ò-kepa} ‘under that stone’ (A12:27), xo-d-à
ilána} ‘under that tree’ (A35:12).
Pronominal suffixes are attached to the base form xo°-, e.g. xó°e ‘under
him’, xó°ux ‘under you (ms.)’, xó°i ‘under me’. Third person suffixes may
be extended by the independent genitive particle, e.g. xó°e díye ‘under him’,
xó°a díya ‘under her’.
Sometimes xo-/xo°- is combined with the preposition m6n even when
static location is intended, e.g. u-m-xò°e} y-oðíwa nùra} ‘and under it they
would put fire’ (B5:183).
The original initial /t/ of this preposition is preserved in some proverbial sayings, e.g. íði txo-kèp5la} ‘My hand is under a stone’ (D2:20), míya
txo-tùna} ‘(He is like) water under straw’ (D2:42).

14.1. Expression of Definiteness
14.1.1. Preliminary Remarks
The term ‘definiteness’ can refer to a cognitive phenomenon in the act of
linguistic communication or to a feature in the grammatical structure of
a language. It is important to distinguish these, since the definiteness
of something on the cognitive level is not always signalled by the grammatical structure. When a nominal is said to be definite on the cognitive
level, this refers to the informational status of a nominal. The crucial
factor is the judgement by the speaker concerning the identifiability of
the referent by the hearer. If the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify which specific referent he is referring to by the nominal, the
nominal is treated by the speaker as definite in status. This assumption
is typically made when the referent has been mentioned previously or at
least is associated in some way with the context or situation that is being
talked about, or when the nominal has a unique referent, as is the case
with proper nouns. If, on the other hand, the speaker assumes that the
hearer cannot identify which specific referent he is talking about, the
nominal is treated as indefinite in status. The grammatical expression of
this definiteness varies across languages.
In Aramaic the distinction between the definite and indefinite status
of nominals was originally expressed grammatically by the distinction
between the ‘determined state’ and the ‘absolute state’ respectively. In
the NENA dialects, this original grammatical means of expressing the
distinction has broken down, but other devices have been developed to
compensate for its loss. In the C. Barwar dialect, as in other NENA dialects
and indeed as in many other languages, the cardinal numeral ‘one’ (xa
m., ða f.) is often used as an indefinite article that is a grammatical signal
of the indefinite status of the nominal. The dialect has not, however, a
corresponding definite article, though, as we shall see, there are embryonic
signs of this developing.","[482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488]"
"the syntax of verbs655If the actionality of the verb is telic, the resultative participle can have
both a verbal and an adjectival interpretation. In the verbal interpretation, the predicate expresses the telic event including both its dynamic and
final static endpoint, the subject of the clause being either the agent or
the experiencer of the event. In the adjectival interpretation, it expresses
only the resultant state of the endpoint. Verbs of this nature falling into
the category of achievements, according to the classification described
above, include, for example, ""tw ‘to sit down’, kly ‘to stand up’, †l"" ‘to go
to sleep’, dmx ‘to lie down, go to sleep’, rkw ‘to mount (an animal)’, m†y
‘to arrive’, npl ‘to fall down’, pq"" ‘to split’, sps ‘to rot’, ""ßy/ßy"" ‘to get stuck’,
gðl ‘to become frozen’:
(1) ""áw hóle tìwa}
(2) ""áw hóle †lìya}
(3) ""áw hóle npìla}‘He has sat down’ (verbal)
‘He is seated’ (adjectival)
‘He has gone to sleep’ (verbal)
‘He is asleep’ (adjectival)
‘He has fallen’ (verbal)
‘He is (lying) fallen’ (adjectival)The adjectival function of the resultative participle of such verbs is demonstrated by the fact that it can function as an attributive modifier of the
participant that is affected by the event, i.e. the subject noun, e.g.
(4) ""aw-náša hóle tìwa}
xzáy6nne ""aw-náša tìwa}
(5) ""aw-yála hóle †lìya}
xzáy6nne ""aw-yála †lìya}
(6) ""aw-yála hóle npìla.}
xzáy6nne ""aw-yála npìla.}‘The man is seated’
‘I see the seated man’
‘The child is asleep’
‘I see the sleeping child’
‘The child is (lying) fallen’
‘I see the fallen child’Furthermore the adjectival interpretation of the copula predicate is shown
by the fact that it can be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’ in cases
where the resulting state is not permanent, e.g. héš hóle tìwa} ‘He is still
seated’, héš hóle †lìya} ‘He is still asleep’.
The category of telic achievements include various verbs that denote
ingressiveness into a state. The subject of these is typically an experiencer
rather than an agent, e.g. pßx ‘to become merry’, xðy ‘to become happy’,
krb ‘to become angry’, my° ‘to become dead, die’:656chapter fifteen(7)""áw hóle xêðya}(8)naša x6ðya
""áw hóle mì°a}
naša mi°a‘He has become happy’ (verbal)
‘He is happy’ (adjectival)
‘A happy man’ (adjectival attribute)
‘He has died’ (verbal)
‘He is dead’ (adjectival)
‘A dead man’ (adjectival attribute)Various telic intransitive verbs have a dynamic component with some
degree of quantifiable durativity and so should be classified as accomplishments, although in some cases the subject is inanimate. These include,
for example, m-qrn ‘to grow up’, m-nty ‘to succeed’, r°x ‘to boil’, ómó ‘to
wither’, qry ‘to study (i.e. to apply one’s mind purposefully to the acquisition of knowledge), be educated’:
(9)bróni hóle mq5rêna}brona mq5r6na
(10) míya hóla r°ìxe
miya r°ixe
(11) ""áw hóle qêrya}
naša q6rya‘My son has grown up’ (verbal)
‘My son is grown up’ (adjectival)
‘A grown-up son’ (adjectival attribute)
‘The water has boiled’ (verbal)
‘The water is boiling’ (adjectival)
‘Boiling water’ (adjectival attribute)
‘He has studied’ (verbal)
‘He is educated’ (adjectival)
‘An educated man’ (adjectival attribute)If the resultative participle in an intransitive clause is from an atelic verb,
which by its nature does not express an event with an inherent resultant
state, only a verbal interpretation is possible. The participle does not function as an adjective expressing a state, as shown by the fact that it cannot
serve as an attributive adjectival modifier of the affected participant of the
event nor can it be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’. Attested atelic
intransitive verbs include those classified as activities and statives.
Activity verbs include, for example, zmr ‘to sing’, bxy ‘to weep’, spr ‘to
wait’, plx ‘to work’:
(12) ""aw-náša hóle zmìra}
*naša zmira
(13) ""aw-náša hóle plìxa}
*naša plixa‘The man has sung’ (verbal)
‘The man has worked’ (verbal)the syntax of verbs657Punctual activities include such verbs as tp° ‘to sneeze’, m-tnx ‘to sigh’
(14) ""aw-náša hóle tpì°a}
*naša tpi°a
(15) ""aw-náša hóle mtùnxa}
*naša mtunxa‘The man has sneezed’
‘The man has sighed’Stative verbs include, for example, zd"" ‘to fear, be afraid’:
(16) ""aw-náša hóle zdìya}
*naša zdiya‘The man has feared’The resultative participle is combined with the copula also in the predicate
of transitive clauses, which contain an argument in addition to that of the
subject. In such constructions the participle always has a verbal interpretation. The participle and the copula agree with the subject, e.g.
(17) ""aw-náša hóle dwíqa bàxta.} ‘The man has seized a woman.’ (verbal)
Perfective transitive events are typically telic, in that they result in a state
which constitutes an inherent endpoint. The affected participant in the
event is generally the goal of the action, in (17) ‘a woman’, rather than
the subject referent. A resultative participle can only be used adjectivally
when it is a predicative or attributive adjective of the affected participant
of a telic event. It follows that the participle can be used adjectivally in
a passive construction such as (18), in which the affectee of the event is
subject. This is shown by the fact that it can be combined with the adverb
heš ‘still’, which can only be used in relation to states, e.g.
(18) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}
‘The woman is seized’ (adjectival)
""ay-báxta héš hóla dwìqta} ‘The woman is still seized’ (adjectival)
""ay-baxta dwiqta
‘The seized woman’ (attributive adjective)
Such passive constructions can also have a perfective verbal interpretation, e.g.
(19) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}‘The woman has been seized’658chapter fifteenThe agent is optionally expressed in a phrase introduced by the preposition l- or m6n. This can be used both when the participle has a verbal
interpretation and also when it is adjectival, e.g.
(20) ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key has been made by Baz
people’ (verbal)
""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key is made by Baz people’
(adjectival)
qðila mturßa l-baznaye ‘A key made by Baz people’ (adjectival attribute)
In transitive clauses such as (17) the resultative participle and the copula
agree grammatically with the subject of the clause, which refers to the
agent, rather than the object, which refers to the affectee, so only a verbal interpretation is possible. Furthermore, the grammatical agreement
with the subject, which is the agent of the event, forces the participle to
be interpreted with an active rather than passive voice. This active interpretation is further demonstrated by the fact that pronominal objects are
expressed by attaching L-suffixes, which are used elsewhere to express the
pronominal object of active verbs, e.g.
(21) ""aw-náša hóle dwìq6lla} ‘The man has seized her’
cf. ""aw-náša b-dawêqla} ‘The man will seize her’
The behaviour of the resultative participle in the various structural configurations discussed above may be summarized in the table below:Intransitive telic

Grammatical subject
Grammatical subjectThe following historical development of the construction may be hypothesized. The resultative participle was originally an adjectival form qualifying the affectee of an event, denoting the resultant state of the affectee
in a telic intransitive event or a transitive event. When used predicatively
an ambiguity developed between the interpretation of the function of the
construction as the expression of the resultant stative property (adjecti-the syntax of verbs659val) or the verbal event that brought about the state (verbal). The verbal
interpretation was extended by analogy to intransitive atelic predicates,
which do not result in any state and could not by themselves provide the
semantic basis required for the formation of the resultative participle. It
was also extended by analogy to transitive active predicates. The feature
of agreement with the grammatical subject was extended by analogy
from the original intransitive/passive construction to the transitive active
construction.
Regarding the copula component of constructions with the resultative
participle, this can be either the deictic copula or the basic copula. As
has been shown in §15.3.1.–§15.3.2., one of the conditioning factors for
selecting one particular type of copula is the nature of the predicate.
The enclitic basic copula and the deictic copula are used with predicates
expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent
basic copula is used only with predicates expressing permanent properties
that, typically, are intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have
not been acquired. It follows that it is in principle not appropriate to use
the independent copula with the resultative participle, which, whether
adjectival or verbal, expresses an acquired property of the subject. There
are sporadic exceptions to this principle, such as (22), where the speaker
appears to have used the independent copula in order to present the
property of being betrothed as a permanent property of the woman in
question:
(22) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} bàxtila.}
‘Don’t you know that she has been betrothed to me since before
she was born? She is my wife.’ (A25:39)
15.4.1.2. Function in Non-Narrative Discourse
We shall now examine in greater detail the function that these resultative
constructions have when used verbally.
It is important to make a distinction between its usage in narrative texts
and its usage in non-narrative discourse.
In non-narrative discourse the resultative form is used to denote the
result of a past verbal event that is in existence in the present. It is generally appropriate to translate it with the English present perfect. The deictic
copula is used with the participle to draw particular attention to a current situation. There is a certain amount of subjectivity in the use of
the deictic copula, but it is generally employed in assertive clauses to
draw attention to a resultant state that has some kind of relevance to the660chapter fifteenimmediate present moment in time, e.g. hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’. In interrogative clauses the enclitic copula is used, e.g. ""6°y5le? ‘Has he come?’ The
construction is negated in both assertions and questions by the negative
copula, e.g. l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’, l5le ""6°ya? ‘Has he not come’.
The expression hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’ denotes that the subject has the
property of ‘having come’, which is the result of a prior event of coming.
It asserts the existence in the present of the result of an event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result.
Therefore, without further specification by a time adverbial in the clause
or by the discourse context, the statement hole ""6°ya denotes that he has the
property of ‘having come’ as a result of some unspecified event of coming
that occurred some time in the past. There is no restriction on when the
event occurred other than that it was some time before the present. The
q†ille form,6 by contrast, refers directly to a specific event in the past and
not to its result. The event has typically occurred in the recent past and
this may extend up to the present moment. The expression dìya °éle} ‘He
has come just now’ would be used to assert the occurrence of a specific
event that has just taken place. Likewise the q†ilwale form °ewale denotes
the occurrence of a specific event in the more remote past.
It may be the case that the result of the actions of q†ille and q†ilwale
have some kind of relevance in the present. This is especially the case
with regard to q†ille, which, in conversational discourse, is often translated
most appropriately with the English ‘perfect of recent past’.7 Such resultant present relevance is, however, an implicature of their use rather than
a component of their meaning. As remarked, the endpoint of an event
expressed by q†ille may be the present moment. The q†ille form °ele ‘He
has come’ would be used by a speaker when he sees a person walking
through the door of his home and the greeting said to the visitor on his
arrival would be b-šˆna °élux!} ‘You have come in peace!’ The resultative
form refers to a resultant state that holds at a period that is not adjacent
temporally with the endpoint of the event. The resultant state is disconnected from the event temporally in that the resultative form is typically
used after some time has elapsed after the event, crucially when none of
the event can be witnessed directly. The resultative form hole ""6°ya ‘He has
come’, for example, would be used when a guest is sitting in the house
6
For the sake of conciseness we shall dispense with noting in all cases the fact that the
q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa forms are suppletive variants of transitive perfective q†ille and
q†ilwale forms when pronominal suffixes are added.

"924chapter eighteen18.1.4.1. Topical Function
The particle is often attached to a clause initial nominal or independent pronoun that has topical status, in that it has been referred to in the preceding
discourse and is the pivot for the new information of the clause. The
particle can be interpreted as enhancing the topical prominence of the
initial item. This reinforces the boundary marking function of the clause
initial topic. In most cases the initial topical item is the grammatical subject. This often constitutes a shift in subject referent from the preceding
discourse, as in (1–4). The clause may be sequential to what precedes
(1–3) or overlapping temporally with it (4):
(1) m•re yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu,} ‘ìdetu} ta-mšax•lpi š•mm6t ’ùxo} mattúle xá-š6mma
xèna.} ""ánna-≥i ""ê°yela.} xìlela-w} šêtyela.} ‘He said “Come, come, you are
invited” in order for them to change the name ’uxo and give him a
another name. They came. They ate and drank.’ (A7:3)
(2) dmìxela.} xá-bena xéta qìmela} qèdamta.} yála-≥ig6n qím5le f†ìr5le} mxúll6lla
pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘They went to sleep. Again they got up
in the morning. The young man got up and had breakfast, washed
his face and went to his work.’ (A21:16)
(3) qímela mšux•lpe b-jùlle.} ""awwá-≥i zìl5le.} ""5-kusí°a múßl6lla gu-""7ne díye t-’ùxo.}
‘They exchanged clothes. He (the shepherd) went and lowered the
hat of ’uxo over his eyes.’ (A7:19)
(4) mubsêmlux,} ˙uriyy?t.} w-ána q6m-maxˆli} w-áti xyára bìyi.} ""ána-≥i m-k7rbi
""•°y6n ""á-k°5°a mútt6nna r6š-núra ""u-xìl6nna.} ‘You enjoyed yourself (with)
houris. But they beat me while you were looking at me. I, out of my
anger, came and put the chicken on the fire and ate it.’ (A2:10–11)
The particle occurs in constructions where two topics are set up in a
disjunctive opposition (‘either x or y’), as in (5), where the nuclear stress
occurs on the subject constituent since the lexical content of the verb is
given information:
(5) har-déwe t-axlìli.} har-t-áz6n gu-d-ànna hambišáye} har-hambišàye-≥i t-axlíli.}
‘(Either) the wolves are sure to eat me (or) I shall go to these giants
and the giants are sure to eat me.’ (A39:4)
In some cases the subject constituent continues that of the preceding
discourse, but the construction nevertheless marks a boundary on some
other level of the discourse. In (6), for example, the clause ""áwwa-≥i q•ry6llaclause sequences925(‘He called to them’) marks the onset of a section where the protagonist
engages directly with the inhabitants of the town, whereas in what precedes he surveys the scene:
(6) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} x•zy6lla náše
jêmye} qúrb6t qáßr6t màlka,} kút-xa mßawó°e xà-m6ndi,} kút-xa mára xà-m6ndi.}
""áwwa-≥i q•ry6lla m•re mòdila q•ßß6t?} ‘In the end God made him come
across the town where the daughter of that king was. He saw the
people gathered near the palace of the king, each one saying something, each one telling something. He called to them and said “What
has happened?” ’ (A4:11)
If the clause with the initial topic is negated, it may stand in an adversative relationship to what precedes, e.g.
(7) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ""u-""áxni-≥i láx muqíme m-bá°re díye
màlka.} ‘On the day he left, his son died. But we have not installed
(another) king after him.’ (A4:32)
18.1.4.2. Focal Function
When the particle is attached to a nominal constituent that is in focus it
has the inclusive sense of ‘also’ or ‘even’. The focused item, which may
occur anywhere in the clause, generally takes the nuclear stress, e.g.
(1) ""ána hadíya m-kêsl6n °áya.} ""u-b8ye ""á°e xazèlux} ""u-qa-t xazéla bràta-≥i.} ‘I
am now coming back from him and he wants to come to see you and
to see also the girl.’ (A4:24)
(2) ""u-b-l7le t-yánne xa-bàxta-≥i} ‘And at night I shall give him also a
woman.’ (A14:63)
(3) ""ítle t8ra gu-˙adìqa} ""u-""ítle dàrga-≥ig6n.} ‘There was a door in the garden
and there was also a main gate.’ (A17:23)
(4) ""6n-háwe dàwa-≥i} ""áxni t-yaw•xla xa-b-†¬à°a ""•lle díye.} ‘Even if it is gold,
we shall give him threefold (if it is lost).’ (A7:10)
On a few occasions the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere in the intonation group, e.g.
(5) d•ry6lla š-qaràw6t,} ""ánna wajjúwe díya-≥i mútt6lla tàma.} ‘They put her on
the bed and they also put her effects there.’ (A21:7)926chapter eighteenThe particle is occasionally attached to a verb in order to express the climax
of a sequence of events. This may be regarded as a focal inclusive function,
marking explicitly that the verb is to be included in the sequence, e.g.
(6) síq5le šqílle xa-kèpa} mútt6lla ""àxxa} kalêb°a,} q†ìl6lla,} dêry6lla,} mqulêbz6lla≥i.} ‘He went up and took a stone, put the dog here, killed it and
(finally) turned it upside down.’ (A30:20)
18.1.5. ""ina
The basic function of this particle is presentative, i.e. it draws attention to
something. The item to which attention is directed may be a referent or a
proposition. The contexts where it is most commonly used are as follows.
18.1.5.1. In Association with Verbs of Perception
It is used in narrative after a verb of perception, usually ‘to see’, to introduce what is perceived. In this context it introduces a proposition rather
than a referent and so is equivalent to the English complementizer ‘that’.
The proposition typically denotes a state or an imperfective progressive
activity rather than a perfective action. The clause that expresses the
proposition generally lacks a copula element, e.g.
(1) ""•°yela xêzye} ""ína †éna kúlle á•¬ya šêxta.} ‘They came and saw that the
saddle bag was completely full of filth.’ (A7:11)
(2) qím5le plì†a} x•zya ""ína b7°6t Qára Té≥din qàða.} ‘He went out and saw
that the house of Qara Te≥din was burning.’ (A26:53)
(3) xzéli b-xêlmi} ""ìna} ""ána zíla l-pardˆsa.} ‘I saw in my dream that I went
to Paradise.’ (A2:7)
(4) qímela zíle x•zye ""ína d°s.} ‘They went and saw that it was true.’ (A14:13)
(5) xár°a tfíqe bíye x•zy6lle ""ína šênya,} npìla.} ‘Then they came across him
and found that he had fainted and fallen.’ (A14:88)
In (6) a construction of this type is followed by a negated construction
with the verb of perception and the presentative particle gapped after
the negative particle la. The ""ina before the la in the negative construction
here has an adversative function (see §18.1.5.3.):
(6) xzèla} ""ína núra †•pya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là b5°a-qíða.} ‘They saw that fire
had been kindled in his house, but not that his house had burnt
down.’ (A48:3)clause sequences927Occasionally the complement clause has a deicitic copula in addition to
the presentative particle, e.g.
(7)wíra x•zya ""ína kúl-xa m5xólta hóla mbušle wíðe hàz6r.} ‘He went in and
saw that all kinds of food were cooked and made ready.’ (A14:29)The particle is sometimes used before a verb of perception. This construction is used when the complement of the verb is an object referent
rather than a proposition, e.g.
(8)pa°êxle t8ra,} ""ína xazéle ""o-""a≥vána tàma.} ‘He opened the door and
saw the caretaker there.’ (A22:43)
(9) l•xma p°ìxle} ""ína xáze ""•sri ""•óóa lêxme.} ‘He opened (the basket of ) bread
and saw that there were twenty-nine loaves of bread.’ (A17:12)
(10) ""á°ya gàšqa} ""ína xazyála Lelì°a.} ‘She comes and looks. She sees
Leli°a.’ (A19:8)
(11) qédamta qím5le xále dìye,} ""ína x•zy6lla ""án ""askaràye.} ‘The next morning
his maternal uncle got up and saw those soldiers.’ (A25:79)
(12) S6ttíye xðìrt5la} ""ína xzì°6lle.} ‘S6ttiye searched and found him.’ (A25:37)When the complement of the verb ‘to see’ is a proposition the subject
of the proposition is sometimes raised into the position of direct object
of the verb. In such case the presentative particle is placed either after
the verb (13–14), which is characteristic of constructions with proposition
complements, or before the verb, which is characteristic of those with
referent complements (15):
(13) xazéle ""ína b7°e áê¬ya.} ‘He sees that his house is full.’ (A21:8)
(14) ""ím6 t-ìn prám6lle,} xzáy6n na°yà°e} ""ína t-h5wàne.} ‘When I was slaughtering it, I saw that its ears were those of animals.’ (A23:39)
(15) ""ína q6m-xaz•nn6x ""áti rába hawnànta.} ‘I have seen that you are very
clever.’ (A40:16)
On some occasions the particle is used to introduce something that is
perceived without the explicit expression of a verb of perception. What
is perceived may be a proposition or a referent. If it is a proposition, this
usually denotes a state or progressive activity, e.g.
(16) qímela mbádla nàše} ""an-mar>wá°a ""ína ""6rwéy kúlla npíle twíra qðalèy.} ‘In
the morning the people, the owners (of the sheep), got up (and
saw) that they had all fallen and broken their necks.’ (B18:7)928chapter eighteen(17) wídle hàtxa,} ""ína kúlla †rì°a.} ‘He put (his hand here) like this (and
felt it) was all wet.’ (A18:30)
(18) mátti bála gu-yàma,} ""ìna} ""a-súst6t yamà°a} nabòl6lla} ’6lk9ze.} ‘They
looked at the sea (and saw) the mare of the seas taking away
’6lk>ze.’ (A12:34)
(19) ""án-naše kúlla xìrra bíye díye} ""ína qur†án6t xmáre tàma.} ‘All the people
looked at it (and saw) that asses’ blankets were there.’ (A23:15)
Note that a 3rd person pronominal subject has zero expression in (20)
and (21):
(20) ‰ìš5le} màlka} ""ína gu-‘à‘ma.} ‘The king woke up (and saw) that he
was in the bathroom.’ (A17:27)
(21) báxte díye xá-bena knàša-wawa,} xírta hátxa †úw6t ""isêq°a,} ""ína bdìla!}
‘While his wife was sweeping, she looked at the diamond of the
ring and saw that it had changed colour!’ (A18:25)
In (22) it is used before a clause containing a q†ille verb form denoting
an event that took place at a point immediately preceding the act of
perception:
(22) m•ra ""Øx ya-""alàhi!} b-xšáw6n gáw‰i °èle.} p°íxle t9ra.} ""ína °èle.} ‘She said
“Oh, my God! I think my husband has come back.” She opened
the door (and saw that) he had come back.’ (A39:18)
The perceived item may be a referent, e.g.
(23) ""o-xabúša p°ìxt6lle,} ""ína ""is•q°a dìya.} ‘She opened up the apple and
(saw) her ring.’ (A4:19)
(24) qím5la bàbi,} šqíl6lla xon>wá°e díye ""ò-parša} d-o-ma©àra,} ""ína xa-mar•gla
gò‰a} á•¬ya dàwe.} ‘He set off, my dear, and his brothers took off the
flat stone, of that cavern (and they found) a large pot full of gold
coins.’ (A39:15)
(25) p°íxt6lla ""ína kúlla dàwe.} ‘She opened them (the bags) and saw all
the gold coins.’ (A39:20)
When a nominal is followed by an non-restrictive attributive description
the construction can sometimes be interpreted as a referent or a proposition. This is particularly the case when the noun is definite in status and
so is suitable for functioning as a clause subject, e.g.","[962, 963, 964, 965, 966, 967]"
"78chapter two2.3.4. /5/
This is generally realized with an open-mid quality [5]. When the vowel is
derived historically from the diphthong *ay, which applies to most occurrences of it (§2.4.1.), there is a tendency to lower it to the region of [æ]
if its duration is reduced. The realization [æ] belongs to the allophonic
spread of /a/. This lowering takes place in posttonic open syllables, e.g.
xìl5le} [}xi[læle] ‘he ate’ (A14:76), ""ˆk5le} [}""5[kæle] ‘where it is’ (A12:37),
bas-lè-y-y6nna bná°i-ll5xu} [}bnæ[°il]æxu] ‘but I shall not give you my daughters’ (A12:17). The lowering is especially common when the vowel occurs
in a word final open syllable. This is because it is the norm for a vowel
in such syllables to be short when the word occurs in the middle of an
intonation group (§2.2.1.3.), e.g. šáta ‘they drink’ < šát5, ""•°yela ‘they have
come’ < ""•°yel5, xazéla ‘he sees them’ < xazél5, b7°a ‘their house’ < b7°5.
Since the lowering is very frequent in this context, such final syllables are
transcribed with /a/ rather than /5/ when the lowering takes place. In
posttonic non-final syllables, such as xíl5le, ""7k5le etc, where the shortening
and lowering is less regular, the /5/ has been normalized in the transcription. Since the vowel in stressed word-final open syllables is generally short
(§2.2.1.2.), it is the norm for /5/ to be lowered to /a/ also in this context.
This is found, for example, in the feminine singular imperative of final
/y/ verbs, e.g. štá! ‘Drink! (fs.)’ < *št7. If a pronominal suffix is added, the
syllable is non-final and the vowel is pronounced long (§2.2.1.1.), so the
/5/ is not lowered, e.g. št7la ‘Drink it! (fs.)’.
The lowering of /5/ also takes place in closed syllables, when the vowel
is shortened, e.g. lat ‘you are not’ < l5t, b5°-qòra [bæ°-}qo[{æ] ‘cemetery’
(A25:89). Where this is very common, as in negative copula forms such
as lat, it is marked in the transcription. When /5/ is lowered in a final
unstressed closed syllable, the resulting vowel /a/ sometimes undergoes
subsequent centralization to /6/, which is a common phonetic process that
affects this vowel (§2.3.5.), e.g. ""•°y6t ‘you have come’ < ""6°y5t.
This distribution of lowered /5/ is, however, a tendency rather than
an absolute rule. Exceptions are occasionally found to the principles just
described. In some isolated cases, for example, /5/ deriving from *ay retains
its low-mid quality when short in a closed syllable, e.g. ""7nta [}""5ntæ] ‘airhole
in an oven’, where the vowel quality may have be retained by analogy
with the corresponding form ""5na [}""5[næ] ‘eye’. Conversely a semi-long
/5/ in a pretonic open syllable and even a stressed long /5/ in an open
syllable deriving form *ay are sporadically realized with a lowered quality,vowels79e.g. ßl5°èy [ßlæ]°e]y] ‘their coming down’ (A4:53), ""u-ta-t-maxz7le [mæx}zæ[le]
‘in order to show it’ (A24:38).
In l5le ‘night’ and the homophonous negative copula form l5le ‘he is
not’ the /5/ is sometimes raised to the region of [e], i.e. [}lÕ[le ~ }le;[le],
by a process of assimilation to the phonetic form of the following syllable.
This quality is occasionally extended by analogy to other forms in the
negative copula paradigm, e.g. l5la [}lÕ[læ ~ }le;[læ] ‘they are not’. In all
these cases the transcription has been normalized with /5/.
2.3.5. /a/
This is often realized in the region of [a] or [æ], e.g. tmanì [tma[}ni] ‘eighty’
(A24:9), màgla [}mæglæ] ‘sickle’ (B5:141), láxxa [}læx[æ] ‘here’ (A24:4),
bná°a} [}bnæ[°æ] ‘girls’ (A24:13).
In the environment of /y/ the realization is sometimes raised, e.g.
lá b>yàtte?} [b5}j5tte] ‘Don’t you want it?’ (A30:33), †¬a°à yomá°a} [†¬á}°5
jo[}mæ[°æ] ‘three days’ (A29:2).
In the environment of the uvular /q/ and emphatic consonants it
generally has the back quality [â], e.g. mbáqrena [}mbâqrenæ] ‘I shall ask’
(A24:6), qá-mo là?} [}qâ]mo] }læ[] ‘Why not?’ (A24:4), ""o-gó‰a [""o[-}go[‰á]
‘the elder one’ (A24:5), q6r†ála [q6r}†á[lâ] ‘saddle basket’ (B5:135).
When the velarization of emphatics is weakened, the vowel still retains
its back quality. This can result in pairs in which the back realization
contrasts with the front realization [æ], e.g.
para [phæ[{æ] ‘dust’pa‰a [pâ[râ] ‘lamb’In the transcription, the difference between such words is represented as
the presence or absence of emphasis.
The back quality [â] is also found in the environment of the labio-velar
glide /w/, e.g. xon>wá°i [xo]nâ}wæ[°i] ‘my brothers’ (A24:24). When preceding this glide, it sometimes acquires also a lip-rounding and is realized
in the region of [â] or even [æ], e.g. zawn-[zâwn] ‘time’ (A1:26), ""áwwa
[""æw[â] nàša} ‘this man’ (A8:4).
Short /a/ vowels in unstressed syllables exhibit a tendency to be centralized. We may refer to this as a process of attenuation, which is associated
with more laxness of muscular tension than is the case in the articulation
of the quality /a/. This is the norm in posttonic closed syllables, such as
the 1fs. and 2fs. endings of present base verbs, e.g. qá†l6n ‘I (f.) kill’ < qá†lan,80chapter twoqá†l6t ‘you (fs.) kill’ < qá†lat, and in loanwords ending in a consonant such
as ‘áng6l ‘fork’ < ‘ángal, mánz6l ‘room’ < manzal. In such cases the vowel
is regularly transcribed as /6/. When the stress shifts onto the vowel, the
/a/ quality is preserved, e.g. qa†lánne ‘I (f.) kill him’, ‘angále ‘forks’. The
centralization also regularly occurs when the genitive/relative particle D
is clitized to the end of a noun ending in -a, e.g. b7°6t málka ‘the house of
the king’ < b7°a-d málka. Here too the vowel is transcribed as /6/.
On some occasions centralization takes place in pretonic or propretonic
syllables. Since, however, in most words it does not occur regularly in this
position, it is generally not represented in the transcription, e.g. bt-áw6t
ma†róye [m6†}‰”[je] ‘you will ride’ (A8:46), ""ána qaryánne [q6{}jænn-] ""o-qál6t
†¬à°a} ‘I shall cry the third cry’ (A8:75). In a few words, on the other hand,
centralization is the norm and it is represented by the vowel /6/ in the
transcription. The regular occurrence of centralization in some words
rather than others has arisen from the fact that it is not a blind phonetic
process but correlates with grammatical function or has become lexicalized. The past converter prefix q6m-, for example, is regularly pronounced
with the vowel /6/, which has arisen by centralization of an original *a
(< *qam- < *q≈am). The preposition qam ‘before’, on the other hand, generally preserves the /a/ quality. This results in minimal pairs such as:
q6m-maxéle
qam-maxéle‘he hit him’
‘before he hits him’It sporadically occurs with short /a/ vowels also in other environments,
such as in unstressed final open syllables, e.g. mðìta} [}mði[t6] ‘town’ (A24:4),
wáða [}wæ[ð6] k>bàbe} ‘making kebabs’ (A24:4), and even in stressed syllables, e.g. t-átw6n [}t6tw6n] ‘that I sit’ (A6:8), y8ð6t [}j6ð6t] mˆla? ‘Do you
know what it is?’ (A16:10). In most cases such as these, where the centralization is not regular, the transcription has been normalized and the
vowel is transcribed as /a/ or />/.
2.3.6. /o/
This is realized in the region of [o] when long and in an open syllable,
e.g., bnóne [}bno[ne[] ‘sons’ (A24:1), xzóli [}Úzo[li] ‘find for me’ (A24:2),
t-oð•xxe [to[}ð6x[e] ‘that we do it’ (A4:48). It sometimes maintains this quality also when pronounced short in an unstressed open syllable, e.g. m7°ovowels81[}m5[°o] ‘bring! (pl.)’ (A24:3), or in a stressed closed syllable, e.g. mandòrta
[mæn}do{tæ] ‘roller’ (B5:145). When the duration of /o/ is shortened,
however, there is a general tendency for it to be raised and centralized to
the region of [Û], e.g. payóxa [phæ]}jo[xæ] ‘cool’ (ms.) vs. payóxta [phæ]}jÛxtæ]
‘cool’ (fs.). In pretonic open syllables, the duration of which tends to
fluctuate according to the position of the word in an intonation group,
the qualities [o] and [Û] often interchange in the same word, e.g. mo°éli
[mo](90)}°e[li] ‘I have brought’ (A24:21) vs. mu°él5xu [mÛ](80)}°e[l5xu]
†ˆra?} ‘Have you brought the bird’ (A24:26). These quality fluctuations
are represented in the transcription.
2.3.7. /u/
When pronounced long this is realized in the region of [u], e.g. šùla [}∫u[læ[]
‘job’ (A24:4), zùze [}zu[ze[] ‘money’ (A24:3), la-hàru [læ-}hæ[{u[] ‘it will not
speak’ (A24:18). When its duration is shortened, it tends to be centralized
somewhat to the region of [Û], e.g. plúx [}plÛ(55)x] ‘work!’ (A24:5), qu-dùqle
[qÛ(60)-}dÛ(75)qle] ‘get up and seize him’ (A24:25), šuréla [∫Û](115)}re[læ]
‘they began’ (A24:26). In a few cases short /u/ is fronted to the region of
[y], e.g. jùlla [}\yl[æ] ‘cloth’ (B5:80); dùnye [}dynye[] ‘world’ (A10:11).
2.4. Diphthongs
2.4.1. *ay
The original diphthong *ay has in most cases contracted to the low-mid
vowel /5/, e.g.
b7°a
q7†a
xaz7li
št7la‘house’
‘summer’
‘they see me’
‘drink (fs.) it!’< *bay∆à
< *qay†à
< *˙àzaylì
< *štàylahAs remarked above (§2.3.4.), this vowel tends to be lowered to /a/ in
positions where it is shortened, e.g.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"512chapter fourteen(15) A: gu-sálla ""í° bé""e xwáre ""u-bé""e smòqe.} B: ""ána šáql6n xakma-smòqe.} ‘A:
In the basket there are white eggs and red eggs. B: I shall take
some red ones.’
When the speaker is not referring to a delimited specific group, but to a
non-specific open-ended group, the indefinite pronominal head tends to
be omitted. This applies to contexts such as the following:
(16) ""u-‘íd5le zóre-u gò‰e.} ‘He invited young and old.’ (A7:3)
(17) xoš-sxí gu-d-ó garr6 zòre.} ‘Go and swim in the pool for young ones.’
(B15:32)
(18) ""í°6n . . . biš-šapìre mènni-w} ‘There are some more handsome than
me.’ (A26:79)
It is found in proverbial contexts referring to generic classes, e.g.
(19) b-núr6t rašíye y-áqði m6skène.} ‘By the fire of wicked people the poor
burn.’ (D2:73)
Likewise the head is omitted in negative constructions where the existence
of any members of a set are denied, e.g.
(20) ""6n-lì° biš-zlíme mènn6n,} har-t-àz6x.} ‘If there are none more wronged
than us, we shall continue on our way.’ (A13:9)
It is important to note that these constructions with headless adjectives
are found also with non-telic resultative participles, which cannot function
as adjective attributes but only as predicates, e.g.
(21) pálxi plìxe,} y-áxli nìxe.} ‘Those who have worked hard work but
those who are inactive eat.’ (D2:33)
It follows, therefore, that also these headless adjectives are not true nominalized adjectives but must be regarded as predicates of reduced relative
clauses without an explicitly expressed head (‘those who are big’, ‘those
who have worked’, etc.).
When a plural adjective relating to a group of feminine gender has
a numeral as its head, the feminine form of the numeral may be used
although gender distinction is neutralized in the adjective inflection, e.g.","[550, 551]"
"530chapter fourteen(19) bíš m-áyya dúk°a ""ˆka xáz6x?} ‘Where could we find (something) better

(2) dráy5le biš-hód6x mènna díya xá‘‘a xàmra.} ‘He put some wine further
up from them.’ (A12:49)
(3) y-oráwa xa-dána biš-hòd6x.} ‘Further time passed (literally: A time
passed further on).’ (B5:6)
14.8.1.3. With Verbs
When combined with verbs the particle may express a comparative degree
of intensity, e.g.
(1) xá‘‘a biš-šlèla.} ‘She became a little more calm.’ (A4:17)
(2) ""ay-hád6x biš-b9ya.} ‘She wants this more (= She prefers this).’
(A8:75)
(3) bíš madqèrre m6n-d-ó déwa t-axèlwa ""èrbe dìye.} ‘He (God) valued him
more than the wolf that ate his sheep.’ (A10:13)
(4) d5r7wa xá‘‘a tùna,} biš-dawùqwa.} ‘They put down a little straw, so
that it became more compact.’ (B5:146)
A particle placed before a verb may intensify the whole verbal predicate,
including not only the verb but also gradable modifiers, e.g.
(5) bíš yáwi †únta ràb°a.} ‘They will yield more abundant fruit.’ (B5:103)
(6) d5rètla sùla lí°6n} qá-t šéta b-šéta biš-mq>rèna tàza.} ‘You put manure on it,
you see, in order that from year to year it grows better.’ (B5:105)
In negative clauses the particle may act as an intensifier of a negator giving
the sense ‘not at all’. It is placed either before or after the negator, e.g.
(7) y-amríwa ""áw bíš la-mzànz6r} yáw6l †éma pày6šwa.} ‘They said that it
does not lose its taste at all. It keeps its taste.’ (B10:76)
(8) ""áp-xa lá-biš-ile-mßaya mqarów-6lla dìya.} ‘Nobody was able to go near
her at all.’ (A4:6)
(9) b-qˆ†a} bíš li°-m6†rà°a,} ""u-bíš li°-tàlga.} ‘In summer there are no rains
at all and there is no snow at all.’the syntax of nominals53114.8.2. zawda, zoda
This particle is used as a comparative quantifier. It is usually, but not
obligatorily, combined with the intensifier biš, the /š/ of which usually
assimilates to the word, resulting in forms such as biz-zawda or bi-zawda.
The particle may be placed after a noun or before it. When placed after
the noun, it sometimes expresses an increase in quantity by the amount
expressed by the noun, i.e. ‘an additional x’, e.g.
(1) y-oráwa . . . xákma dána . . . xá-sa""6t biz-zòda,} qayêmwa.} ‘Then, after
some time had passed, one hour more, the resurrection would be
celebrated (literally: he would arise).’ (B5:54)
(2) b8y6n ""álaha t-yawèlli mèndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
more.’ (A3:1)
(3) ""ána b8y6n ""aláha t-yawèlli kùl-m6ndi bi-záwda.} ‘I want God to give me
more of everything.’ (A3:3)
To express an excess of something (‘too much . . .’) constructions such as
(4) are used:
(4) q6m-hawètli zúze záwda m6n-làz6m.} ‘You have given me more money
than necessary (= too much money).’
The particle may also have a looser relationship with the preceding noun
and have the sense of ‘or more’ in estimates of quantity. When used in
this way, it is sometimes put in a separate intonation group from that of
the noun, e.g.
(5) y-oráwa šaqláwa dàna} rába gàye} ""6štà yarxé} xamšà yarxé} biz-zàwda.} ‘It
would take time. Often it would take five or six months, or more.’
(B5:3)
(6) šaqèlwa m8°>lan xamší kilo""é bi-zòda.} ‘They would take, for example,
fifty kilos or more.’ (B5:125)
The phrase (biz)-zawda m6n is used before a nominal expressing a quantity
in the sense of ‘more than . . .’, e.g.
(7) ""u-bréle díya b-xšáw6n biz-záwda m6n-""6óóá-mma ""álpa nàše.} ‘By now there
have been born, I think, more than nine-hundred thousand people.’
(B2:10)532

club of his was more than one hundred kilos.’ (A29:14)
záwda m6n-""arbá-mma šênnele.} ‘It is more than four hunrdred years
old.’ (B6:31)The particle may be used independently of a noun either as the argument
of a verb or as an ascriptive predicate, e.g.
(10) hállule bìš-zawda m6n-kúlla náše.} ‘Give him more (food) than (you
give) anybody else.’ (B17:16)
(11) y>ðíwa mo-qádra d5rˆwa} t-lá-hawewa biz-zàwda} yá'ni t-la xarùwwa.}
‘They knew how much to put on, so that it was not too much and
it spoilt.’ (B5:191)
(12) zàwd5la mènni.} ‘It is too much for me (to tell).’ (A26:65)
The particle may function as an adverb, e.g.
(13) lá masp6rèxl6x bi-zàwda.} ‘We shall not make you wait any more.’
(A4:42)
(14) x8yiwa biz-zàwda.} ‘They survived longer.’ (B5:190)
(15) mèra b-qáry6n ""u-hèš-biš záwda.} ‘I shall call still more.’ (A8:72)
The particle is combined with the noun sama ‘portion’ in the phrase sama
zoda to express the majority of a set of items, e.g.
(16) xákma har-damxíwa l-9ra} ""ína sáma zóda ""iy7wala qaràw6t.} ‘Some would
even sleep on the floor (of the roof). Most people, however, had a
bed.’ (B5:204)
(17) ""ína sáma zòda} y-oðíwa ""9raq.} ‘Most people, however, would make
arak.’ (B5:213)
The phrase may also be used adverbially in the sense of ‘mostly, most
frequently’, e.g.
(18) yá'ni z5píwa tàlga} . . . ""ima-t-y-a°éwa tàlga} sáma zóda b-yárx6t trèss6r} yárx6t
xà.} ‘They would push off the snow . . . when it snowed, mainly in
December and January.’ (B5:196)the syntax of nominals53314.8.3. Equality of Degree
Equality of degree (‘as big as you’ etc.) is expressed in phrases with the
preposition ""ax/max ‘like’, e.g.
(1) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa lèxma,}
""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from iyare
were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this (necessity
to beg for) bread and you would not be sitting here and become
so poor.’ (B17:16)
14.9. Non-Attributive Modifiers
14.9.1. kut ‘each, every’
This particle is used before a singular indefinite noun and has a distributive sense (‘each of the items of the set named by the noun’). It appears
to be derived historically from the phrase *kul-xa-t < *kull-˙a -d ‘each
one of ’. It is normally combined with the noun in the same stress group,
e.g. kut-yàrxa} ‘each month’ (A24:5), kut-†éna ‘each load’ (B5:181), kut-mèsta
‘each hair’ (A27:10). The final consonant is often pronounced voiced
when in contact with a following voiced consonant. The transcription,
however, has been normalized and the letter is always written /t/. If the
noun consists of at least two syllables, the stress is generally placed on the
noun. The stress is retracted onto the quantifier particle in some cases
where the noun has sufficient syllables to take it. This occurs mainly with
phrases containing nouns that are qualified by a relative clause and so are
themselves of attenuated information status, e.g. kút-duk°6t kále sùsi} ‘each
place that my horse stops’ (A26:27).
The quantifier particle is not combined with the indefinite particle xa
before a noun. It may, however, be combined with xa when this is used
pronominally, e.g.
(1) kút-xa y-azèlwa b6°-dìye.} ‘Every person went to his home.’ (B5:18)
(2) kút-xa xá-m6ndi y-áwe mbùšla.} ‘Everybody has cooked something.’
(B5:48).
This phrase is used as an appositive to pronominal reference of all persons, e.g.","[568, 569, 570, 571, 572]"
"clause sequences935(8) maxíwale b-réš6t nàše,} kúlla ""áni là mbarxíwal5 qáša-w šamàša.} ‘They
tapped it on the head of people, while the priest and the deacon
blessed them all.’ (B16:24)
18.2.2. Gapping of the Negator
When a negated clause is followed by one or more clauses that are negated
in sense and elaborate on the first clause, the negative particle la may be
gapped. This applies to all verbal forms, including imperatives (3):
(1) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa l•xma,}
""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare
were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this (miserable condition of begging for) bread and would not be sitting here,
in such a needy state.’ (B17:16)
(2) tùna d5r•xwale gáwe} qa-lá-ßaliwa míya ""êlt6x,} qa-t-ßáliwa míya hátxa b-rèš6n.}
‘We would put straw in it, so that water would not flow down, so
that water would not flow down on our head.’
(3) lá-wuð hàtxa} q†úl ""anna-bnón6 náše kùlla.} ‘Don’t do that, don’t kill all the
people.’ (A29:17)
In (4) the construction with the gapped negator is separated from the first
by an intervening imperative. The gapping explains why the ""i-qa†6l form
y-asq6n is used with future reference (< la-y-asq6n ‘I shall not go up’):
(4) l•mu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} hálli ˙àwla.} y-ásq6n kúlla q7se mj>mênna} ""u-""úrxa
pa°xênna} qa-t-míya ßála qam-tar-gêppa?} ‘Why should I not go (alone)?
Give me a rope. (Why should I not) gather all the wood and open up
the way so that the water will come down to the door of the cave.’
(A39:10)
18.3. Intonation Group Boundaries
When presenting a series of connected main clauses, the speaker may
utter each clause in a separate intonation group, e.g.
(1) j•nne ""ê°yela,} šqìl6lla Zíne} nùbl6lla Jazíra Bóta.} ‘The jinn came and took
Zine, took her away to Jazira Bota.’ (A26:8)936chapter eighteen(2) ""áwwa qím5le qedàmta,} šqíl6lle xa-m6n-sús6t xàle,} tíwa l-xáße dìye,} ""u-ßêlya.}
‘He got up in the morning, took one of his father’s horses, sat on
its back and went down.’ (A25:40)
(3) ""u-zìl5le,} mútt6lle réše dìye} dmìx5le.} ‘He went, put down his head and
slept.’ (A25:43)
(4) p7š6n xa-nêšra} t-yátw6n l-xàß6x} m†amrênn6x gu-""úpra.} ‘I shall become an
eagle and sit on your back and bury you in the ground.’ (A25:63)
In some cases more than one main clause is placed in the same intonation
group. This is found particularly with short verbal clauses, often consisting
of no more than the verbal form without any nominal complements. If
there are nominal complements, these tend to occur in the final clause.
In general, the effect of placing two or more clauses together in the
same intonation group is to present the activities expressed by the clauses
as being closely related in that they can be interpreted as forming components of a single overall event. The clauses of the series, moreover, usually
have the same subject. There is no formal syntactic subordination in the
form of subordinating particles and the verbs in the series are, in principle,
in the same form (e.g. q†ille, q†il5le etc.). There are, however, some formal
signals of dependence, which reflect their close cohesion. The initial verb,
for example, is combined directly with the following verbal clause in an
asyndetic paratactic construction rather than being linked with the connective particle w, e.g.
(5) zílle qítle b-xa-†ùra.} ‘It went and hit a mountain.’ (A50:10)
(6) táwra mítle npìlle táma.} ‘The ox died and collapsed there.’ (A22:9)
In a series of compound verbal forms in narrative sequences a conspicuous reflection of dependence is the omission of the copula element after
the first verb (§15.4.1.3., §15.4.2.3.), e.g.
(7) ""•°y5le tíwa b-dìw6n.} ‘He came and sat down in the reception room.’
(A26:63)
There is a particular tendency for the occurrence of prosodic bonding of
clauses in a single intonation group after certain verbs (§18.3.1.– §18.3.8.)
and in certain syntactic contexts (§18.3.9.– §18.3.11.).","[973, 974, 975]"
"the syntax of verbs681(18) mère yèmmi ""7nile plìxa?} mèra bábi plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra} ""u-""ána
mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “Mother, who has worked?” She said
“My dear, you have worked, (also) the ass and the ox, and I have
attended to the house.” ’ (A21:13)
Observe that in the responses of (16) and (17) the copula that occurs with
the resultative participle is an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. This
reflects a tendency to use the enclitic copula in conversational discourse
when the verbal form is in the presupposition of the clause and is not
asserted. This is typically the case in responses to constituent questions
when the verb is repeated.
The construction is sometimes used elsewhere in a more subjective
fashion, in places where the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to
an item, due to its unexpectedness or its importance in the context, e.g.
(19) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Have you sent for me for this reason?’ (A21:35)
(20) ""abàyele dèrya b-réša.} ‘He put his cloak over her.’ (A26:50)

the girl said “How can it be crooked? We made it exactly according
to a spirit-level.” ’ (A17:20)
(22) mèra màlka t-áw6t basíma.} ""áwwa náša hàtx5le wáða.} màra} mú t-àw6ð?}
xa-dúk°6t gèld6t tàwr6n híw6lle báne b7°a.} ‘They said “King, may you
be well. That man is doing such-and-such (i.e. building the fortress
of D6md6ma).” He said “What could he do? I have given him the
space of an ox skin to build a house.” ’ (A11:15)
(23) Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} yá'ni xá°6t Mir-Zàndin-ile šqíla Qára Tè≥din.}
‘Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law, that is Qara Te≥din has married
the sister of Mir-Zandin.’ (A26:55)
(24) ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše.} ‘The Christians were not slipping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)
(25) xòš-zuz6x wíðe.} ‘We have made good money.’ (A14:18)
Constructions such as those in (19)–(25) are not making contrastive assertions to correct a misapprehension nor are they responses to an explicit
constituent question. The section of the clause that is not in focus is not
strictly a presupposition, i.e. it is not necessarily assumed to be a proposition that is active in the mind of the hearer. It is part of the assertion of
the clause but with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused item.
Its lack of communicative pronominence relative to the focused item is a682chapter fifteenproperty that it shares with presuppositional material. The basic function
of the leftward focus movement can, therefore, be identified as a means of
marking an enhancement of prominence on the item in question without
necessarily implying that the remainder of the clause is presuppositional.
In (19)–(22) the motivation for the construction is that the argument in
the clause is deemed by the speaker to be unexpected in the general situation described. In (23) it draws particular attention to the identity of the
person whom Qara Te≥din married, since this is the crucial point that
defines the term x6tna ‘brother-in-law’. Likewise in (24) the speaker gives
enhanced prominence to the ‘sheepskin shoes’ since these were the crucial
reason why the Christians did not slip and so were the key to their success.
In (25) prominence is given to an evaluative expression ‘good money’ in
order to enhance the degree of evaluation.
Temporal adverbial expressions may be put into focus with the construction in order to convey immediacy, e.g.
(26) bálki qam-xa-šàb°5le ""è°ya.} ‘He has come perhaps just a week ago.’
(A8:56)
The focusing of a gradable quantifier or intensifier with the leftward
copula movement conveys an enhanced degree, e.g.
(27) ""ána ràb5w6n plíxa gu-k7rma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
(28) ""áw hàdele bèrya.} ‘He has just been born.’
In constructions such as (27) and (28) the elements that come after the
focus are not necessarily presuppositional, but may be part of the assertion of the clause with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused
item. In such constructions with quantifiers and intensifiers the nuclear
stress is sometimes placed at the end of the intonation group rather than
on the item bearing the copula, e.g.
(29) ""ána ráb5w6n plíxa gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
(30) yóma hádele zrìqa.} ‘The sun has just now risen.’ (A26:37)
(31) xúwwe ""áx‘ile múdwa rìqa.} ‘The snake just managed to escape.’
(A1:15)
In constructions such as (29)–(31) the material after the item bearing the
copula is part of the assertion. These examples show that the copula andthe syntax of verbs683the nuclear stress placement may operate independently in the marking
of prominence. The nuclear stress is in the default position at the end of
the intonation group and signals that the predicate as a whole is asserted
new information. The copula is used to give particular prominence to one
item in this assertion. In such constructions the copula marks a weaker
level of prominence than when it is combined with the nuclear stress. The
item with the copula is, nevertheless, given more prominence than when
there is no leftward copula movement at all, as in (32).
(32) ""ána rába plíx5w6n gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
Conversely the nuclear stress is occasionally moved forward to give particular prominence within the intonation group without the copula moving
from its default position, e.g.
(33) xzáy6t-6lle ""áwwa qàßra?} kúlle b-qarqupyà°a bèny5le.} ‘Do you see this
palace? It is all built of skulls.’ (A24:51)
(ii) Topically Prominent Constituent
A leftward moving copula may also be attached to a topically prominent
constituent. A constituent with topical prominence has a referent that has
been mentioned in the immediately prior discourse, with the result that
it is not only assumed to be familiar to the hearer but also activated in
his consciousness. It serves as the topic of the clause. Unlike an item in
focus, the topic is not part of the assertion of the clause, rather it is the
remainder of the clause that is asserted and that conveys new information
about this topic.
Topical items with a leftward moving copula do not bear the nuclear
stress. They are, therefore, given a weaker level of prominence than focused
items that have both the copula and the nuclear stress.
Not all items that serve as a clause topic have the leftward moving
copula attached to them. This construction is restricted to topics that
the speaker wishes to give particular prominence. One context in which
the construction is attested is where the item has been activated in the
immediately preceding discourse and is repeated in consecutive clauses.
This is the case in (1) and (2), in which the second occurrence of the item
in question has a copula attached to it:
(1)""áti rába wíð6t spayù°a} ""u-""átit pqiðêll6n.} ‘You did a lot of good and
you instructed us.’ (A8:87)684chapter fifteen(2) mátti táxta hàtxa} ta-t-""àzi,} lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} táxt5la mútte hàtxa}
ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They placed a board like this, so that they could go
(there)—there are no steps—so that they can go down to the basement. They placed a board like this, so that they could go down
there.’ (A22:10)
These constituents are anaphorically bound to the immediately preceding discourse and function as the informational starting point, i.e. topic,
of the ensuing propositions. These can be regarded as two aspects of a
broader notion of topic as a current item of concern in the discourse. The
constituents would have this status even if they did not have the copula
enclitic. The copula gives added coding, which enhances the prominence
of this status. This ‘heavy’ coding of the clause initial topic is often used
as a strategy to signal a boundary in the discourse. The purpose of signalling the boundary may be to mark the clause off distinctly from what
precedes in order to give prominence to the content of the clause, which
appears to be the motivation in (1) and (2). In (3) the strategy of boundary marking is used to mark a clear opposition between the actions of
the subject referents in two adjacent clauses:
(3) mbàdla,} qyàm5la,} kúlla b8yi t-àzi,} ""áww5le dmìxa Barzèkko.} ‘In the
morning they got up and all wanted to go, but he, Barz6kko, was
asleep.’ (A12:8)
The construction may also be used to give topical prominence to the
anaphoric element hatxa ‘thus’, which refers back to a situation in the
preceding discourse. In (4) the purpose is to set the two clauses apart and
present them as expressing separate events:
(4) hátx6n wíða be-xàli,} hátx6n wíða be-""àmti} ‘I did such-and-such in the
house of my uncle, I did such-and-such in the house of my aunt.’
(A23:40)
(iii) Other cases of leftward movement
It is necessary to distinguish some other categories of construction which
exhibit leftward movement of the copula enclitic. These include interrogative constituents, adverbials and certain subordinating particles.
(a) Interrogative constituents
The copula element of the resultative is generally attached to interrogative constituents. In some cases the interrogative constituent bearsthe syntax of verbs685the nuclear stress and it can be classified as the expression of a type of
narrow focus. The remainder of the clause is presuppositional and the
focus is put on the interrogative item. Unlike assertive clauses, however,
the identity of the interrogative item is not being asserted but rather
questioned. Examples:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""ˆnile plíxa ""èdyo?} ‘Who has worked today?’ (A21:15)
""ˆnile q†íl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A28:7)
mòdit wíða?} ‘What have you done?’ (A23:34)
yóm6 tré ""ˆk5tu dmíxe?} ‘Where did you sleep on the second day?’
(A12:19)
m-ˆk6t ""è°ya láxxa} ""u-dàx-it ""è°ya?} ‘From where have you come here
and how have you come?’ (A14:33)
dàx-it xíla kúlla?!} ‘How have you eaten all of it?!’ (A2:11)Such constructions are analogous to interrogative clauses such as (7) and
(8) in which the question concerns one constituent:
(7)
(8)""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Was it you who killed the snake?’ (A24:45)
""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} ‘Was it you who brought back my bird?’ (A24:32)In many cases, however, the nuclear stress is placed on the final word of
the intonation group rather than on the interrogative constituent, e.g.
(9) ""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
(10) ""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
(11) m8nile mèßya z6dy6lléy laxxàne?} ‘Who could have thrown them here?’
(A8:15)
(12) módit xèzya qam-ˆnux?} módit xêzya?} ‘What have you seen before your
eyes? What have you seen?’ (A24:31)
(13) módin xèzya b-xêlmi?} ‘What have I seen in my dream?’ (A1:14)
(14) ""7ni báxt5la mubrˆ°a?} ‘Which woman has given birth?’ (A25:6)
(15) †la-módit ""è°ya dmìxa} gu-šwì°i?} ‘Why have you come to sleep in my
bed?’ (A26:3)
(16) ""u-lé-y-y>ð6n m-7k6t ""ê°ya.} ‘And I do not know from where you have
come.’ (A14:76)
(17) y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I have put him?’ (A22:44)
Such constructions, in which the nuclear stress is not on the interrogative
constituent, have a different information structure, in that the question686chapter fifteenis not focused exclusively on the interrogative constituent but rather on
the proposition as a whole. The attachment of the copula enclitic to the
interrogative constituent, therefore, cannot be motivated by its being in
narrow focus. The interrogative constituent, nevertheless, is what the
question primarily requests information about and so is given prominence
by the copula, but this is a weaker level of relative prominence than
constructions in which the constituent is marked both by the copula and
by the nuclear stress.
(b) Adverbials
Narrow focus is sometimes given to an anaphoric adverbial by attaching the copula to it and giving it the nuclear stress. As in some of the
examples of narrow focus on nominals cited above, the remainder of the
clause is not always necessarily a presupposition. The purpose of giving
the adverbial a high degree of prominence is to enhance its anaphoric
function and bind it closely with what precedes, e.g.
(1) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
(2) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
word) †alana means “shady”, since when the sun rose, the mountains
became like that (i.e. became shady).’ (B3:2)
(3) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa
xóni tàm5le bèrya.} ‘My father set up home there. We went, as far as
I remember, together with my older brother. This brother of mine
was born there’. (B8:10)
In (4) this device of enhancing the force of the anaphoric binding of the
adverbial is used in a clause that has the status of a relative clause. The
effect is to bind the clause clearly to the preceding head noun:
(4) ""5-dúk°6t m>m6ðìwal6n,} ""ax-xa-bányo zòra,} ""átxa gu-""úpra nqìra,} kúll6n
tàm5w6x m5mèðe t-íw6x bèrye}—""áw6n pìš5wa.} ‘The place in which they
used to baptize us, like a small bath, dug into the earth, where all
of us who were born were baptized—that has survived.’ (B3:20)
An adverbial that does not bear the nuclear stress may have the copula
attached to it, as in (5), where the copula is moved leftwards onto the tem-the syntax of verbs687poral adverbial in the clause ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme}. This may be regarded as
a type of topical prominence, which is a weaker level of prominence than
the prominence expressed by both the copula and the nuclear stress. The
effect, as is generally the case with clauses with initial topically prominent
items, is to signal a boundary in the discourse. Although the initial item
is anaphorically bound to what precedes, its status as a communicative
starting point is enhanced. This is the case here, in which the clause in
question offers a piece of incidental information about the general historical situation, which is not directly connected to the event of the wedding
discussed in what precedes. This should be contrasted with the function
of the construction occurring earlier in the passage ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni
Šèmmo}, in which the adverbial is given a stronger degree of prominence by
both copula movement (in this case a past copula) and by nuclear stress.
The speaker intends this clause to be bound closely with what precedes,
since it relates directly to the wedding.
(5) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,}
""áskar t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ""6ngl6znàye}
""áskar-t léwi tàxr6n.} ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘I remember
the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune. It
was then that Š6mmo married. I remember the English, the Levy
army. At that time the borders were moved, they were moved up
to Turkey.’ (B9:21)
A similar strategy is exhibited by (6)–(8). Here the adverbs with an enclitic
copula but without the nuclear stress are linked correlatively to the following clause rather than being bound to what precedes. In (6) the following clause specifies the content of the adverb. Examples (7) and (8)
are adversative constructions. The initial adverbials set up an expectation
that is reversed in the second clause:
(6) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situation is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
(7) zíl5le †8ya bràtux.} hád6x-ile wìða,} bás lˆle xèzy6lla.} ‘He went to look
for your daughter. He acted thus, but did not find her.’
(8) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
times we have sat together, I still cannot be like him.’ (A25:44)688chapter fifteen(c) Subordinating Conjunctions
In subordinate clauses opening with the general subordinating conjuction
D or the conditional particle ""6n the copula is attached to the conjunction
at the front of the clause.
The subordinating conjunction D may serve as the head of a relative
clause (1–3) or the subordinative operator of other types of clause, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)
la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do
not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed
has died.’ (A4:33)
t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux dèry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
""áx-t-it-""áti šêtya,} ""áp-""aw hàd6x.} ‘As you have drunk, he also (has
been treated) in the same way.’ (A26:33)
dáx t-in-mu°7°6lla ""a-béna xèta,} ""ay-béna ""àna ma°yánna.} ‘Just as I
brought her before, so this time I shall bring her.’ (A27:30)
""ím6 t-íla mú°y6lla ""a-bráta ""èlle dìye,} mbùrx6lla.} ‘When they brought
that girl to him, they wedded her (to him).’ (A16:6)
xá-xeta qímela zìlela,} ha-t-íla zíle óêmy5le.} ‘They went (to help) once
again, but by the time they had gone, it was put out.’ (A48:4)
l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
(A17:2)On many occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intonation
group, e.g.
""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went
back down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previously.’ (A26:32)
(10) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his
son died.’ (A4:32)
(11) ""ánna dax-t-ìla zíle,} M8mo dèry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘When they had gone,
they put M>mo in jail.’ (A26:74)
(12) ""ax-t-ìle wíra,} ""í°wa dúk°a ta-t-kalèwa.} ‘When he entered, there was
space for him to stand.’ (A22:30)
(9)The placement of the copula on the subordinate particle in relative clauses
can be related to the use of leftward copula movement to mark topicallythe syntax of verbs689prominent items. The referent represented by the D particle, which is that
of the antecedent noun in the adjacent main clause, is clearly the main
topical concern of the relative clause. Although such copula movement
to mark topical prominence is an optional strategy in main clauses, it has
been formalized as a fixed rule in subordinate relative clauses. It would
appear that this was further generalized to other types of subordinate
clause opening with the particle D.
Examples of leftward movement of the copula in protasis clauses opening with ""6n:
(13) ""èn-in ""àna ""è°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep
in you bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
(14) ""6n-it ""è°ya šúl6t qa˙bù°a,} k6s-báb6n B9ku.} ‘If you have come to fornicate, then (lodge) with our father B>ku.’ (A26:26)
The movement of the copula onto the conditional particle ""6n is likely to
have arisen from the fact that the particle was originally followed by D,
as is still the case in some NENA dialects.
15.4.1.4.2. Rightward Movement of the Enclitic
The default position for the nuclear stress of an intonation group is on
the last item in the group. When the nuclear stress occurs in this position,
therefore, it does not necessarily express ‘narrow focus’ on this one item
but frequently expresses a ‘broad focus’ which includes the whole predicate
of the clause.9 The copula element may be shifted rightwards onto this
word with nuclear stress at the end of the intonation group. This is done,
however, only when the nuclear stress is expressing broad focus. The purpose of the construction, therefore, is not to express narrow information
focus on the word, with the remainder of the clause presupposed. Rather,
the clitic gives the item in question an enhanced prominence within the
broad focus of the predicate, due to its importance or unexpectedness. In
example (1) a group of men are transformed into sheep, which is presented
as a surprising and pivotal development by the placement of the copula
on the nouns at the end of the intonation groups. In (2) the rightward
shift of the copula highlights the royal clothes, by which the king’s son
identifies himself, and this is an important turning point in the narrative.","[719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"
"When the fronted prepositional phrase bears the nuclear stress, it expresses
an information focus, the rest of the clause being presuppositional, or at
least less prominent, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)""ána b-àrbe lánwa zwán6lle} zawnènne b-†ê¬¬6°?} ‘I would not buy it with
four legs, would I buy it with three?’ (A22:8)
""aw-t-lá-šax6n b-zráqt6t šêmša} b-gnˆ°a la-šáx6n.} ‘He who does not get
warm with the rising of the sun, does not get warm at its setting.’
(D2:21)
""ána qa-S6ttìye b8y6n.} ‘I love S6ttiy6 (not anybody else).’ (A25:22)
dáx lítl6x xá†6r bàxta,} ""u-bt-à°6n} gu-d-ànna ""7ni bt-á°6n.} ‘Of course,
you are welcome, my lady. I shall come. By these eyes (of mine) I
shall come.’ (A22:20)In such cases the short prepositions b- and l- are occasionally omitted on
the focused item, e.g.
(9)har-gubbàn6x (< b-gubban6x) wíð6lle.} ‘We made it exactly according
to a spirit-level.’ (A17:20)
(10) kut-""èrba ""aql6t-gàne (< b-""aql6t-gàne) páy6š tèlya.} ‘Every sheep is hung
up by his own legs.’ (D2:55)
(11) ""áyya yalêxta} bàbila (< l-bàbila) zqírta} ""u-xá°i Nasìmola (< l-Nasimola)
mnuqášta.} ‘This handkerchief was woven by my father and embroidered by my sister Nasimo.’ (A37:12)884chapter seventeen17.7.12. Placement of Adverbials
The placement of adverbials in relation to other components in the clause
is conditioned by a number of factors. We shall consider here both verbal and copula clauses, since the conditioning factors are the same. The
majority of adverbials that occur in the text corpus are temporal or spatial
expressions. The various positions can be classified as follows.
17.7.12.1. In Clause Initial Position
Temporal or spatial adverbials that stand at the front of a clause in
principle mark a shift in the discourse and set the temporal or spatial
frame for what follows. This frame often incorporates a series of clauses.
Examples:
(1) xá-yoma ßlèle,} ""ína šmíle xzéle ""ína †ê¬¬6°-yawne tíwla táma.} ‘One day he
went down and heard (something) and saw that three doves had
alighted there.’ (A14:81)
(2) xá-yoma ßléla gu-gòma.} ríx6t júlla díya °èle.} mèra hóla làxxa.} ‘One day
she went down into the basement. The scent of her clothes came
to her. She said “They are there.’’ ’ (A14:100)
(3) šúry5le zráya hàl-""aß6rta.} ""aßèrta ""á°e l-bˆ°a.} ‘He began cultivating (and
continued) until evening. In the evening he came home.’ (A21:12)
The temporal frame may be set by a distributive adverbial expression,
e.g.
(4) kút yom6t-šáb°a míya là-hawe gu-néra.} ‘Every Saturday there is no water
in the river.’ (A14:50)
(5) ""u-kut-šéta xa-gáya y-oðèxwa m6n-d-o-""ùpra.} ‘Once every year, we would
collect this mud.’ (B10:68)
(6) kut-yárxa t-yánnux xámši dinàre.} ‘Every month I shall give you fifty
dinars.’ (A24:5)
In descriptive discourse, some kind of shift is often marked by a reidentification of the temporal frame by an anaphoric adverbial such as ""5-ga ‘at
that time’ or tama ‘there’. In (7), for example, these adverbials are used in
a clause that occurs at the beginning of a section of discourse concerning the churn. The reidentification is also used to mark a shift from the
foreground discourse to a background comment (8):the clause
(7)
(8)885""7-ga táma gu-ma°wá°a k6slˆni} ""í°wal6n gùða.} ‘At that time, there in
our community in the villages, we had a churn.’ (B7:20)
maxíwa ""ilàna.} ""7-ga lì°wa kéka.} y-asqíwa l-gàre,} ""5-dán6 m5°íwala k yàlo,}
napßìwala.} ‘They would set up the tree. At that time there was
no cake. They would go up onto the roof, at the time when they
brought the bride and shook it.’ (B10:27)In narrative the initial adverbial may express the point at which an event
takes place, e.g.
(9) bár †¬a°a-yóme dì‰‰e.} ‘After three days he returned.’ (A3:6)
(10) ßêlyela.} yom6t-†¬á°a mê†yela} l-Amedìa.} ‘They went down. On the third
day they reached Amedia.’ (A25:77)
On some occasions the initial adverbial is placed in a separate intonation
group. The effect of this is to disjoin more forcefully the clause from what
precedes. Some of the examples of such adverbials in the text corpus are
numerical expressions such as those in (13)–(15), which denote members
of a limited set of points or periods in time. The added disjunctive effect
of placing the adverbial in a separate intonation group marks these off
distinctly in contrastive opposition:
(11) xa-yòma} qímla zílla mêra} t-áz6x l-""êrwe.} ‘One day they set off and
said “Let’s go to the sheep.” ’ (A25:23)
(12) ""o-lèle} y-azèxwa be-k yàlo.} ‘That night we would go to the house of
the bride’s family.’ (B5:28)
(13) bén6 †ê¬¬6°} nàpla} bàxta.} ‘The third time the wife fell.’ (A20:11)
(14) yóm6t trè} ""ay-là xílla.} ‘On the second day she did not eat.’ (A21:14)
(15) yóm6t xàmša,} qímla ""áy m-b8dal xmá°a dìya.} ‘On the fifth day, she got
up instead of her mother-in-law.’ (A21:22)
An initial adverbial that is not placed in a separate intonation group on
some occasions takes the nuclear stress. This is used to put a narrow
information focus on the adverbial. In clauses containing a copula, the
copula is placed on the adverbial, e.g.
(16) kúlla lˆlela l-bálux?} ‘Has it been on your mind all night?’ (A25:67)886chapter seventeenWhen narrow focus is placed on anaphoric adverbial expressions, its
function is to strengthen the anaphoric bond with what precedes. In (17)
and (18) the adverbial ‘at that time’ binds the clause with what precedes
rather than setting the temporal frame for what follows:
(17) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
(18) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,} ""áskar
t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ‘I remember
the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune.
At that time Š6mmo married.’ (B8:21)
By contrast, in (19) the initial adverbial is not marked by the nucleus and
it sets the temporal frame for what follows. The copula on the adverbial
here signals topical rather than focal prominence (§15.4.1.4.1. ii):
(19) ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘At that time the borders were
moved, they were moved up to Turkey.’ (B9:21)
When the anaphoric adverbial hatxa has narrow focus, it likewise links the
clause to what precedes, e.g.
(20) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse,} max-d-ánna t-ásqi "">bu-bêrqa.} ""áxni hàtx5wa
semált6n ""ap-""áxni.} ‘A ladder is made of wood, like the ones that the
electricity workers climb up, our ladder was like that.’ (B10:60)
(21) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king repled to me thus.’ (A17:34)
(22) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše.} ‘You should treat people like this.’ (A22:47)
In (23), on the other hand, where it is does not have the nucleus, it is
forward pointing:
(23) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situation is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
A backwarding linking function is performed also by the focused spatial
adverbials ""axxa ‘here’ and tama ‘there’ in (24)–(27). In (26) and (27) these
occur after a subject constituent, but their function is the same:the clause887(24) dámx6x š-gêšra,} biš-salàm6t-ile.} ""áxxa xuwwáwe ma-xuwwáwe lˆ-y-a°5
l-d-áwwa gèšra.} ""àxxa damxéxi.} ‘Let’s sleep on the bridge. It is safer.
Here—snakes and the like will not come onto this bridge. Let’s
sleep here.’ (A30:49)
(25) ""7ka ßà†qa} tàma z>réti.} ‘Wherever she squats down, you should
plough there.’ (A30:4)
(26) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa
xóni tàm5le bèrya.} ‘My father set up home there. We went, as far
as I remember, together with my older brother. This brother of
mine was born there’. (B8:10)
(27) ""5-dúk°6 t-íxwa m5mêðe,} hálbat saw>wá°6n t-qám°a kúlla tàm5wa m5mèðe.}
‘That place where we were baptized, of course all our ancestors
were baptized there.’ (B3:21)
17.7.12.2. Adverbial in Clause Final Position
When temporal or spatial adverbials are placed at the end of the clause,
they, in principle, do not mark a shift in the discourse by setting the
temporal or spatial frame for what follows. Rather the clauses in which
they occur are cohesively bound to what precedes. This is seen in (1) and
(2), in which the adverbials are anaphoric. The clause with the adverbial
‘at that time’ in (1) develops the description of ‘mats’, which have been
introduced in the preceding clause. In (2), from a narrative, the clause
with the adverbial ‘on that day’ does not introduce a new episode, but
rather recapitulates on an event that has already been related:
(1)
(2)""í°wa y-amrèxwa xaßìra.} xaßíre m5°7wala m-mðinà°a ""7-ga.} ‘There was
a mat, as we called it. They brought the mats from the towns at
that time.’ (B5:199)
xá-yoma ""í°wa xá-qaša ""u-xà-malla.} . . . šèryela gu-xa-""otèl.} . . . šèryela gud-7 ""otél ""o-yòma-w} píšela hàd6x.} ‘One day there was a priest and a
mullah. . . . They put up in a hotel. . . . . They put up in the hotel
that day and remained there.’ (A2:2)17.7.13. Clauses with an Interrogative Constituent
Interrogative particles that function as a subject, object or adverbial in the
clause are in principle placed before the verb. The nuclear stress is placed
either on the fronted particle or at the end of the intonation group. If
the verb is a compound form containing a copula, the copula is attached
to the interrogative particle:888

(8)chapter seventeen
módi wìdle?} ‘What did he do?’ (A20:5)
mó t-òð6x?} ‘What shall we do?’ (A14:47)
mó b9y6t?} ‘What do you want?’ (A12:62)
mòditu xèzye?} ‘What have you seen?’ (A12:16)
†la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why did you do that to me?’ (A15:14)
""ˆnile q†íl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
""7ka p7š6n ""àrxa?} ‘Where can I be a guest?’ (A26:26)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally not placed
between the interrogative particle and the verb, but rather is positioned
either before the interrogative particle or after the verb. The decision to
place the subject at the front or end of the clause is conditioned by the
discourse factors that have been discussed above (§17.7.2.), e.g.
(9) Barzèkko módi wìdle?} ‘What did Barz6kko do?’ (A12:7)
(10) x6yál5xu mù-q†ila?} ‘What have you decided? (literally: What have
your thoughts decided?)’ (B5:2)
(11) ""ána mò-""oð6n?} ‘What should I do?’ (A21:2)

(13) ""áxni mò t-áxl6x?} ‘What shall we eat?’ (A10:5)
(14) ""áwwa mòdile wíða?} ‘What did he do?’ (A22:27)
(15) mót mára ""àti?} ‘What do you say?’ (A25:21)
(16) mò ""awðéna ""ána hadíya?} ‘What should I do now?’ (A26:13)
(17) mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} ‘What dog have you given birth to?’
(A11:20)
In a few sporadic cases the subject intervenes between the interrogative
particle and the verb, e.g.
(18) mút ""áti tíwta làxxa?} ‘Why are you sitting here?’ (A25:58)
The interrogative particle mo is used to express exclamation in constructions such as (19), in which the verb is repeated:
(19) qìmta} mgašóqe hàtxa,} mo-mgàšqa!} ‘She got up and looked and what
(a sight) she sees!’ (A25:59)the clause889This construction is used also with intransitive verbs, e.g.
(20) ""ánna ßàli} ""ína mò ßáli!} ‘They went and what (a surprise when) they
went down! (A25:13)
(21) dmíx5le xá-bena ‰ày6š} ""ina mò ‰áy6š!} ‘He went to sleep, then woke up,
but what (a surprise when) he woke!’ (A14:30)
The adverbial interrogative particle dax is used also in a longer form daxi.
The occurrence of the longer form is prosodically conditioned, in that it
occurs predominantly in pause at the end of an intonation group, as is
the case with the long forms of verbal inflections (§15.12.), e.g.
(22) dàxi?} ‘How (could this be)?’ (A25:69)
(23) báxta dìya dáxi?} ‘Wife, now how (can we solve the problem)?’
(A20:9)
17.7.14. Negated Verbal Clauses
17.7.14.1. Negative Particle before Verb
When a verbal clause is negated, the negative particle la is normally
placed immediately before the verb. Various stress patterns are attested
in relation to this particle. In some cases it is stressed and in others it is
unstressed (§6.4.). It takes the nuclear stress of the intonation group when
the speaker wishes to give the negation particular prominence. This is
found predominantly in the following circumstances.
(i) Negated Deontic Expressions
When the negated verb has a deontic modality, such as a prohibition
addressed to the hearer or an expression of deontic intention by the
speaker, the negator is often given prominence, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)là mtalpètle} là-daqr6t bíye.} ‘Do not harm him! Do not touch him!’
(A26:73)
là maßí°6t!} ‘Do not listen!’ (A26:11)
là-mßaw°6t!} ‘Do not speak!’ (A26:89)
bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)
là maštóla míya!} ‘Do not give them water to drink!’ (A25:9)
""ána là-""a°6n mènnux!} ‘I shall not come with you!’ (A6:6)
là-""awr6n gu-má°a!} ‘I shall not go into the village!’ (A25:34)890chapter seventeen(ii) Adversative Contexts
The negator is given prominence when the clause defeats an expectation
that arises from what precedes, e.g.
(1) spírra spìrra} bróna díya là °éle.} ‘She waited and waited, but her son
did not come.’ (A14:21)
(2) ták-tak mxáy6lla goyá°6 sùsa} ta-t-dày6‰ súsa m-táma,} là-jwijle súsa.} ‘He
struck the sides of the horse so that the horse would move away
from there, (but) the horse did not move.’ (A26:28)
(3) mèra t-ásq6n ta-t-axèlli xùwwe.} mère ""ána t-á°6n mênn6x.} ""áti xúwwe là
""axèll6x.} ‘She said “I am going up in order for the snake to eat
me.” He said “I shall come with you. The snake will not eat you.” ’
(A24:39)
(iii) Contrastive Oppositions
When the negated clause is set up in a contrastive opposition with what
precedes, the negator, which is the focus of contrast, has the nucleus,
e.g.
(1) mèra ""ána báxt6t ""á©6t ô?l-iw6n.} ""áyya xmá°a díya homênna.} x6myána
homênne.} bróna homênne.} kúlla homênna.} kál°a là homènna.} ‘She said “I
am the wife of the a©a of ôàl.” Her mother-in-law believed it. Her
father-in-law believed it. The son believed it. Everybody believed
it. The daughter-in-law, however, did not believe it.” ’ (A19:2)
(2) réši parmênne} ""u-réš6x là parmènne.} ‘I shall cut off my head. I shall not
cut off your head’ (A14:35)
(iv) Verb mßy ‘to be able’
(1) ""ána là-mß6n t-á°6n mènnux hátxa.} ‘I cannot come with you in that
case.’ (A26:18)
(2) ""ána là-mß6n ma°yánne.} ‘I cannot bring him back.’ (A25:75)
(3) †¬á gáye súse dìye} °éle ta-t-šàw6r} là mßéle.} ‘Three times his horse came
up to jump but could not do so.’ (A25:55)
(4) zmìrra,} là-mßela bíyi.} ‘She sang and could not beat me.’ (A25:69)
(v) Negator Combined with Intensifier
In some cases a negator with the nuclear stress is combined with the
intensifying particle xo-/xu-, e.g.","[922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 928, 929]"
"the clause847(1) t-yánnux ""úpra k6mà-t b8y6t} ""u-plóx gáwe díye ""u-mápl6x nàše.} . . . ""úpra
""ìtli} áa¬yàn5le.} ‘ “I shall give you as much land as you want. Work
on it and employ people.” . . . “I have land, (which) is sufficient.” ’
(A21:41–42)
(iii) In constructions with the negative existential particle, the nominal is
sometimes fronted without the nuclear stress where it is not anaphorically
linked to the preceding discourse, e.g.
(1) ""ána zúza lìtli,} f>qìrt5n.} ‘I do not have money. I am poor.’ (A22:19)
17.4.3. Possessor Expressed by a Nominal
If the possessor is expressed by a nominal or independent pronominal
form, it is not made the complement of the preposition l- but rather is
extraposed at the front of the clause and resumed by an L-suffix. This
reflects the fact that the L-suffix is acquiring the properties of verbal
inflection as is the case in the q†ille form of the verb. Examples:
(1) ""aw-málka ""í°wale xa-bròna.} ‘That king had a son.’ (A4:1)
(2) kul-má°a ""í°wala q6nyàne.} ‘Every village had domestic animals.’
(B15:43)
(3) sab-kúlla lì°wale táwre.} ‘because everybody did not have oxen.’
(B5:73)
On some sporadic occasions the possessor is extraposed at the end of
the clause, e.g.
(4) hóle ""í°6n bóya zòra.} ""u-""áp báxta díye hóla tàma,} ""u-""ítle ""ayàle} ""o-tèla.}
‘There was a small hole (in it). His wife was there also, and the fox
had children.’ (A20:5)
Constructions such as (4) with final extraposition are typically used when
the clause is presented as an elaborative tag that is cohesively connected
with what precedes. Constructions with initial extraposition such as (1)–(3),
on the other hand, express a greater disjunction from what precedes and
present the clause with more distinctness and independence.","[885, 886]"
"952chapter nineteen19.1.1.1. Definite Head Nominal
(i) Restrictive Clauses
When the head noun is definite, i.e. it has a specific identifiable referent or refers to an identifiable generic class, a restrictive relative clause
is syndetic. The clause has the function of an attributive modifier that
is embedded in the nominal phrase. It does not assert new information,
as is the case with an independent clause, but rather expresses information that is presupposed to be known to the hearer. The clause supplies
a description that allows the hearer to identify the referent of the head
noun. The definite status of the head noun, therefore, is indissolubly
bound with the relative clause. In principle such a definite head noun is
introduced by an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun. This is usually the
default demonstrative pronoun, the basic function of which is to signal
that the referent of the noun is identifiable in the context to which it is
anaphorically linked. The restrictive relative clause, which is intended
to provide the means of identifying the referent, is sometimes the only
source of identification. The anaphoric link, therefore, is clearly internal
to the nominal phrase, e.g.
(1) ""an-suráye t-wáwa gu-Tùrkiya} zílla l-""Ir6n.} ‘The Christians who were in
Turkey went to Iran.’ (B2:8)
(2) šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘You put the sapling in the land that
you like.’ (B5:103)
(3) ""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)
In these constructions it can be said that the demonstrative is a correlative
with the relative particle. The demonstrative binds the head noun tightly
with the relative clause. This is because the interpretation of the noun with
the demonstrative depends on the relative clause and it cannot be interpreted successfully without it.
In some cases the referent of the head noun has been mentioned in
the preceding context. Even here, however, the restrictive relative clause,
with which the head noun is syntactically linked, can be regarded as the
primary anaphor of the demonstrative and here also it has a correlative
function, e.g.
(4) ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)syntactic subordination of clauses
(5)953""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)The relative clauses in (4) and (5) can be interpreted as restrictive, in that
the head noun requires further description to ensure that the correct
referent is distinguished from other possible members of the set of items
named by the noun that are associated in some way with the context and
are, therefore, available as possible referents for the noun. The purpose
of the relative clause, therefore, is not to supply further information but
rather to assist in the identification of the referent. The anaphoric demonstrative, which invites the hearer to seek the identification of the referent
of the noun in the surrounding context, would naturally be interpreted
in the first instance as linked to the relative clause that is embedded in
the nominal phrase.
Restrictive relative clauses are used also after head nouns that have an
adverbial function, e.g.
(6)""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yaw•lla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘In the year they would die
he gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)
(7) ""áp-ana y-a°7wa b-rèši hátxa} ""o-yóm6 t-ínwa zòra.} ‘They would come into
also my head when (literally: in the day that) I was young.’ (A26:12)
(8) ""7-g6t damêxwa,} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°à l5l>wá°a háwe dmìxa.} ‘When
(literally: at the time that) he slept, he would be asleep for three
days and three nights.’ (A29:2)
(9) ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo,} yawíwala mêšxa.} ‘When (literally: at the time that)
the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
(10) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die I
shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)
In some cases the head noun of a restrictive relative clause has a speaker
deixis demonstrative, e.g.
(11) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
following now.’ (A21:35)
(12) qímli zílli šqílli ""áwwa júlla t-íle gu-púmm6t mzíð6t pràge.} ‘I went and took
the cloth that is in the mouth of the bag of millet.’ (A23:23)
(13) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—I have made
an assignation with the three of them.’ (A22:21)954chapter nineteenIn cases such as (11)–(13) the speaker deixis demonstrative should be
interpreted as having an anaphoric rather than an ostensive, i.e. ‘pointing’,
function. As shown in §14.3.2., the speaker deixis demonstrative is often
used with an anaphoric function where the speaker wishes to present the
referent in question with close perspective. The relative clause is restrictive
since it expresses presuppositional information that is intended to assist
with the identification of the head noun.
The correlative function of demonstrative pronouns in restrictive relative clause constructions whereby they are linked by anticipatory anaphora
to the following relative clause (14) is likely to have been modelled on
nominal relative clauses (15):
(14) ""o-gáw‰a t-íle gu-bˆ°a} ‘The man who is in the house’
(15) ""o-t-íle gu-bˆ°a} ‘He who is in the house’
In nominal relative clauses such as (15), which are always restrictive, the
demonstrative occurs as the obligatory head of the clause, which cannot
stand independently. The construction (14) can be regarded as an internal expansion of (15), whereby the nominal head is an extension of the
pronominal head.
(ii) Non-restrictive clauses
Non-restrictive relative clauses following definite head nouns are semantically closer to independent clauses than attributive modifiers. Their purpose
is to supply an additional description of a referent that is assumed to be
already identifiable. They are, therefore, assertive rather than presuppositional, though the syntactically subordinate structure has the effect of
presenting the information as backgrounded. Examples:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
(A26:64)
zìl5le} mùkl6lla táwre t-w7wa zráya.} ‘He went and stopped the oxen,
which were ploughing.’ (A9:5)
qímle b-zdáya m-x•lme díye t-wéwa xêzy6lle.} ‘He began to be afraid of
his dream, which he had dreamt.’ (A8:19)
""u-""up-báxte dìye} t-íle gwìr6lla} rába hawnànt5la.} ‘Also his wife, whom
he had married, was very clever.’ (A17:21)It can be seen that in some cases the relative clause is separated from the
head noun by an intonation group boundary. This feature, however, is notsyntactic subordination of clauses955exclusive to non-restrictive relative clauses, as can be seen in (13) in section
(i) above, where it occurs in a construction with a restrictive clause.
In (5) it is separated from the head not only by an intonation group
boundary but also by intervening components of the clause:
(5) n•mu ""áyya b•rke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
you are swimming?’ (A25:61)
The non-restrictive relative clauses in constructions such as (1)–(5) may
express information that is familiar to the hearer, but, crucially, the speaker
is presenting them as assertions, albeit in some cases recapitulatory, rather
than as presuppositions. Sentences with an embedded non-restrictive
relative clause, therefore, contain two assertions, the truth of which can
be assessed independently of one another. In (1), for example, there are
two assertions, viz. (i) ‘He said to Zine’ and (ii) ‘M>mo loved Zine’. In a
sentence with an embedded restrictive relative clause, on the other hand,
there is only one assertion. Example (i 1), for instance, only asserts ‘The
Christians who were in Turkey went to Iran’. It does not entail the assertion
‘The Christians were in Turkey’. If an unidentified head noun requires
further delimitation in order for its referent to be identified, it is natural
to link it with a description based on a familiar, presupposed proposition
(‘There were Christians in Turkey’) rather than one based on an as yet
unknown proposition. When the head noun is identifiable in that it occurs
in a context where there is judged to be no possible confusion with other
members of the set of items named by the noun, any further description
must be assertive. As remarked, however, the syntactically subordinate
status of this assertion in the non-restrictive relative clause presents it as
background information. The informativeness of the clause may, indeed,
be very low, as in (4), where the hearer would naturally assume that if
a man has a wife, he would have married her! The construction can,
however, be interpreted as the assertion of an event that is added as an
afterthought, which would be equivalent to a sequence of clauses such as
‘He married a woman. His wife was also very clever’.
The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relatives is based
on the availability of other potential referents for the head noun in the
particular context in which the construction occurs. In (6), for example,
the clause can be interpreted as restrictive and presuppositional, since
it occurs in a context where other girls are on the scene. In (7), on the
other hand, there is only one basket on the scene, so the relative should
be interpreted as non-restrictive and assertive.","[990, 991, 992, 993, 994]"

(ii) d6-, deThe particle d6-/de- may be related to the adverbial particle diya ‘now’. It

p-‘ak ‘armed’
p-hawas ‘happy’C. Barwar
b-šrara ‘truthful’
b-xamme ‘worried’(v) In both the C. Barwar and Kurdish dialects the copula verb ‘to be’ is
expressed by an enclitic that is inflected for person and number like
a verb. Although there are signs of the emergence of such a clitic in
earlier Eastern Aramaic, its full development and acquisition of verbal
inflection are apparently due to the influence of Kurdish:
Kurdish
C. Barwar
aw kurd-a ""aw qurðay5le (< qurðaya-ile)
‘He is Kurdish’
tô kurd-ì
""ati qurðay5w6t (< qurðaya-iw6t) ‘You (ms.) are Kurdish’
Kurdish inflectional morphological material is occasionally incorporated
into Aramaic words. This is the case, for example, with hypocoristic vocative forms of names. In the C. Barwar dialect these take the endings -o and
-e, the latter being characteristic of female names (§20.2.22.), which are
the Kurdish inflectional endings of vocatives (MacKenzie 1961: 156).
In some cases there is a convergence of the phonetic form of an item
in the NENA dialect with a corresponding item in Kurdish without there
necessarily being a borrowing of morphological material. Such phonetic
convergence is found, for example, in the demonstrative pronouns. In
C. Barwar there are three categories of demonstrative, viz. near to speaker,
in the distance, and absent. The Kurdish dialects of the region not only
have the same tripartite demonstrative system but also have demonstrative
pronouns of a strikingly similar form. Those from among the sets listed
by MacKenzie (1961: 174) that are of the greatest similarity are shown in
the following table. Despite this resemblance, the pronouns in C. Barwar
can be explained as having an internal Aramaic etymology (§7.4.):
C. Barwar
""awwa
"">waha
""aw‘this (ms.)’
‘that (ms.) over there’
‘that (absent)’Kurdish
awa
awèhè
awThe verbal system of C. Barwar and the NENA dialects in general has
undergone fundamental changes from what is found in the earlier literary forms of Aramaic. The two finite verbal forms of earlier Aramaic,
known as the suffix conjugation (q†al) and the prefix conjugation ( yiq†ol,introduction21liq†ol, niq†ol ) have been completely replaced by participles, which have
acquired verbal properties and verbal inflection. Broadly speaking, the
erstwhile active participle serves as the base for verbal forms expressing
present and future tenses or the past tense with an imperfective aspect
whereas the erstwhile passive participle serves as the base of past tenses
with a perfective aspect.
Several features of the verbal system that is found in C. Barwar have
parallels with Kurdish and must be considered to be contact induced.
These include the ergative type of construction of the perfective past verbal
base q†il-, whereby past actions are expressed by a passive construction
with the patient being presented as the grammatical subject rather than
by an active construction with the agent as the grammatical subject (§8.3.),
e.g. baxta q†ila-le ‘He killed the woman’ (literally ‘The woman was killed
by him’). This type of ergative construction with perfective past verbs,
which is common to the whole NENA group, has parallels in Kurdish
(MacKenzie 1961: 193–194). Another innovation of C. Barwar, which is
found only in a subgroup of NENA, is the use of a compound construction consisting of the combination of an originally passive participle q†ila
(referred to in this grammar as the resultative participle) and the verb ‘to
be’ to express the perfect (§15.4.1.). Again, this appears to have arisen by
influence from Kurdish, which has a parallel type of compound construction (MacKenzie 1961: 187–189).
It is important to observe, however, that there are some differences
between the C. Barwar dialect and the local Kurdish dialects in these
two verbal forms. In Kurdish the ergative type construction of the past
perfective with the patient of the action being the grammatical subject
and the agent expressed by an oblique agentive phrase (‘by X’) is naturally
restricted to transitive verbs. In the C. Barwar dialect and most other
NENA dialects, however, the ergative type of inflection with an agentive phrase (‘by X’) expressed by the preposition l- has been extended
by analogy to intransitive verbs, e.g. qim-le ‘He has risen’. This has not
happened in Kurdish or any other Iranian language in the NENA area.
In fact, in some Iranian languages the precise opposite has happened,
namely the active intransitive construction with the verb agreeing with
the grammatical subject has been extended by analogy to the transitive
past conjugation. This is the case, for example, in Modern Persian. The
extension of the ergative inflection to intransitives seems, rather, to be a
development internal to NENA. Vestiges of the original system in which
the ergative inflection is restricted to transitive verbs has survived in a22introductionfew Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery of the NENA area (e.g.
J. Sulemaniyya, J. Kerend and J. Sanandaj).32
Another difference between C. Barwar and Kurdish is the fact that in
C. Barwar the compound perfect construction is not ergative. The grammatical subject of transitive verbs is the agent rather than the patient. In
Kurdish, on the other hand, the corresponding compound construction,
which appears to have been the model for the NENA construction, is
ergative in form when the verb is transitive. The loss of the ergative inflection in C. Barwar and most other NENA dialects is again a development
internal to NENA. The original ergative type of construction has survived
only in a few Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery.33
These developments suggest that the influence from Iranian on the
Aramaic verbal system must have had a considerable time depth. In fact,
traces of ergative inflection of past tense verbs is found in Aramaic as early
as the 5th century B.C. and also in the main literary languages, Syriac,
Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic and Mandaic, in the first millennium A.D.
This must have arisen by contact with earlier forms of Iranian, such as
Old Persian and Middle Persian, where ergative constructions are found.
It is significant that in Classical Syriac texts a number of cases are found
where the ergative inflection is used with intransitive verbs, e.g. qìm l-eh
(Nöldeke 1904, §279). This is presumably the result of interference from
the vernacular and shows that the analogical extension of the ergative
inflection to past intransitives had taken place many centuries ago in the
vernacular.34
The influence of Arabic on the C. Barwar dialect is largely restricted to
the lexicon (§20.1.2.2.) and has not had a discernible effect on the phonological and grammatical structure. In the twentieth century the speakers of
C. Barwar were immersed in an Arabic speaking environment, both due
to their residence in the Iraqi towns and also due to the use of Arabic in
schools. The fact, however, that Arabic influence has not penetrated the
grammatical structure of the dialect in the same way as Kurdish and its
Iranian predecessors suggests that this intensive contact with Arabic is a
relatively recent phenomenon. Indeed many of the Arabic loanwords that
are established in the lexicon entered the dialect through Kurdish rather
coming directly from contact with Arabic (§10.11., §20.1.2.2.).","[58, 59, 60, 61]"
"510chapter fourteen(6) ""árya héyw6n maxj6làna y-áwe.} ‘The lion is a terrifying animal.’
An adjective with a default demonstrative head, on the other hand, may
refer to a non-anaphoric generic class. In such cases English most idiomatically uses the indefinite article, e.g.
(7) ""o-gó‰a g8r6g lá-maxe ""o-zòra.} ‘A big (person) should not hit a small
(person).’
(8) ""an-gó‰e g8r6g lá-maxi ""an-zòre.} ‘Big (people) should not hit small
(people).’
(9) ""o-kóra xa-záwga ""ˆne b8ye.} ‘A blind man wants a pair of eyes.’ (D2: 62)
The explanation appears to be that an expression such as ""o-go‰a ‘the big’
is a reduced form of the relative phrase ""o-t-ile go‰a ‘he who is big’, in
which the demonstrative is anaphoric within the phrase, in that it binds
the referent of the pronoun to the description in the embedded relative
clause. The construction, therefore, assigns the property to the head,
like a predicative adjective, rather than presenting it as a component of
the description of the head. This analysis is supported by the fact that
resultative participles of atelic intransitive verbs may be combined with a
demonstrative, e.g. ""o-zmíra zmárta xàwrile} ‘The one who has sung the song
is my friend’. Such participles cannot be used as attributive modifiers of
nouns but can only be used predicatively (§15.4.1.1.). A phrase such as
""o-zmira, therefore, must be analysed as a reduced relative phrase in which
the participle is predicative (""o-t-ile zmira).
Generic phrases are definite since they refer to an entire class, inclusive
of all its referents, which the hearer is assumed to be able to identify from
its description alone. A demonstrative cannot have ‘intra-phrasal’ anaphora
when a noun head is qualified by an adjective, e.g. ""o-naša go‰a ‘the big
man’, which must be anaphorically linked to the preceding discourse.
Intra-phrasal anaphora is only possible in constructions with a genitive/
relative particle D, or reduced forms of these constructions. This particle
can be regarded as the anaphor of the demonstrative. It follows that the
adjective in a phrase such as ""o-naša go‰a cannot be regarded as being a
reduced embedded relative ‘the man who is big’, whereas this analysis
is applicable to the adjective in a phrase such as ""o-go‰a, which can be
regarded as a reduced form of ""o-t-ile go‰a ‘Hei whoi is big’.
Likewise a demonstrative can have intra-phrasal anaphoric reference in
annexation constructions, which contain the particle D. Again, the anaphor
of the demonstrative must be this particle. Examples: m-an-t-qanàne} ‘somethe syntax of nominals511of those with horns’ (A7:24), gu-d-ó garr6 zòre} ‘in the pool of young ones
(< garr6t zore)’ (B15:32), gu-d-o-gárra dìya} ‘in their pool’ (B15:32). The referents of none of these are mentioned in the preceding discourse.
An indefinite nominalized adjective that has the indefinite cardinal
particle xa/ða as its head generally has a specific referent, e.g.
(10) mutt7°6lla †6¬¬ê° x6mm6ryá°a,} m-an-xm6ryá°6 tabzìye.} mutt7°6lla r6š-párš6t
""ˆna,} ða-smòqta,} ða-xwàrta,} ða-milànta.} ‘She laid down three beads,
beads of a rosary. She put them on the stone slab of the spring,
a red one, a white one and a blue one.’ (A25:34)
In some circumstances it can be used when the phrase has a non-specific
referent, provided that it is extracted from a known, limited set. In a
context such as (11), for example, the phrase ða-smoqta ‘a red one’ can
have either a specific (‘one particular red one’) or non-specific (‘any of
the red ones’) interpretation:
(11) A: gu-sálla ""í° bé""e xwáre ""u-bé""e smòqe.} B: ""ána šáql6n ða-smòqta.} ‘A: In
the basket there are white eggs and red eggs. B: I shall take a red
one’
The indefinite cardinal particle tends to be omitted, however, when the
existence of the set that it belongs to is unknown. A construction such as
that in (12), for example, would be used when the speaker has no evidence
that any big apples exist:
(12) la-hálli ""o-xabúša zòra,} ""ána b8y6n gò‰a.} ‘Don’t give me that small
apple, I want a big one.’
Similarly the cardinal particle is omitted in negative constructions when
the existence of the class is denied, e.g.
(13) gó‰a lì°.} ‘There is no big one.’
(14) ""í°wa-w lì°wa} bíš m-álaha gò‰a} lí°wa gò‰a.} ‘There was and there was
not, there was no great one greater than God.’ (A8:2)
Nominalized plural adjectives typically take the indefinite pronoun xakma
as their head when they refer to a specific group of referents extracted
from a set, e.g.","[548, 549, 550]"
"the clause829(13) xa-kàrm5le} rába gò‰a.} ‘It is an orchard (which is) very large.’
(A12:9)
When the adjective occurs in the same intonation group as the head noun,
the copula is placed at the end of the phrase, e.g.
(14) ""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n.} ‘I am an old man.’ (A8:43)
(15) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} ‘It is a long story.’ (A25:52)
(16) xa-qèßß6t rába mapš6mànt5la.} ‘It is a very sad story.’ (A4:31)
On some sporadic occasions the copula is placed on a quantifier or intensifier particle that stands before the head of the predicate, e.g.
(17) ráb5wa náše xêðye.} ‘The people were very happy.’ (B15:12)
(18) ráb6xwa xèðye pßìxe.} ‘We were very happy and cheerful.’ (B16:6)
(19) t8r6t ""ùmra} ráb5wa kòpa.} ‘The door of the church was very low.’
(B15:2)
(20) kúlla qumašàt ""7-ga bíš-w5wa rešàye.} ‘All the material at that time was
of the very best quality.’ (B10:45)
This retraction of the copula can be regarded as a device for expressing the prominence of the intensifier particle. The predicate as a whole
expresses new information, so the particle is not being singled out as the
only information focus in the clause. This is reflected also in the prosody,
in that the nuclear stress is placed at the end of the predicate, which is
intended to mark the whole phrase as new information. Rather, within
the new information of the predicate, the intensifier is being given an
enhanced prominence. This can be compared to a construction with a
compound verbal form such as (21), in which the copula is moved back
onto the quantifier raba to give it an enhanced prominence within the
new information of the predicate:
(21) zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ‘I had cultivated it with
my hands and greatly toiled in it.’ (A17:32)
When the subject constituent is postposed, in some isolated cases it is placed
after the head noun of the predicate but before a dependent modifier.
This applies to (22), in which the independent subject pronoun intervenes
between a noun and its adjective. As with other cases of postposed subjects,
the clause has a status of a comment on what precedes it:830chapter seventeen(22) káze xoš-ßlìg6n} yalúnka ""áti zòr5w6t.} ‘He tried (to persuade him to go)
“Go down, you are a young child.” ’ (A29:28)
17.1.2. Independent Copula
17.1.2.1. Basic Predicate
An independent standing copula without a subject constituent is attested
in the text corpus in two contexts.
(i) Present Copula before the Predicate
These tend to occur as answers to rhetorical questions such as (1) and (2):
(1)
(2)""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèw6n.} ‘They put
the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
(B6:38)
x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
it? It is water.’ (B6:53)This type of question and answer structure has a similar function to
clauses with an independent copula after the subject such as guða ""ile g6ld6t
heyw6n, x5la diya ""ila miya (§17.1.2.2.), which typically supply an explanatory
or elaboratory comment on what precedes.
(ii) Past Copula after the Predicate
These constructions do not appear to be significantly different in function
from corresponding ones with an enclitic copula. The ‘heavier’ coding
brought about by the prosodic separation may have been exploited by the
speaker to give the clause added prominence, e.g.
(1)
(2)gu-bˆ°a wéwa.} ‘He was in the house.’ (A6:1)
rába tàza ""iyéwa.} ‘It was very good.’ (B5:55)17.1.2.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
Clauses containing an independent standing copula generally have a
subject constituent in the form of an independent pronoun or a nominal.
The constructions discussed in §17.1.2.1. which lack a subject constituent
are far more rarely attested in the text corpus. The subject constituent is
regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate. The copula
is placed either before the predicate, immediately after the subject (1–6),the clause831or is placed after the predicate (7–10). This applies both to the present
and the past copula.
(1)
(2)
(3)""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
(4) b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
(A26:55)
(5) m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
wood.’ (B5:87)
(6) w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ‘He was an angel.’ (A8:25)
(7) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
(8) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
(9) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)
(10) tròßa} ""áni milàne ""iy7wa} ‘In fact, they were green.’ (B5:218)
The placement of the copula immediately after the subject in clauses such
as (1)–(6) expresses the topical prominence of the subject. This reinforced
coding of the topic in initial position functions as a discourse boundary
marker. The construction is used either in statements that supply explanatory information concerning what precedes or in statements that open
a section of discourse. When acting as explanatory comments on what
precedes, they differ from constructions with postposed subjects such as
(§17.1.1.2., examples 18–24) in their degree of independence and prominence. The postposed subject constructions are incidental comments that
are tagged onto what precedes. The constructions with the initial subject
and following copula are presented as important pieces of information,
which typically have relevance for what follows as well as being explanatory of what precedes.
As remarked, the position of the copula after the subject expresses the
topical prominence of the subject. The prosodic detachment of the copula
as an independent word can be interpreted as a ‘heavy’ grammatical coding
device intended to give the clause as a whole prominence and distinctness.
Construction such as (7)–(10) which have have a prosodically independent
copula after the predicate exhibit this latter device. They can, therefore, be
regarded as expressing some degree of prominence. Indeed, they can all
be interpreted as being intended as important statements in the contexts832chapter seventeenin which they occur. They lack the additional device of reinforcing the
topical prominence of the subject as a means of marking their distinctness. It should be noted, however, that in the attested examples of this
construction a pronominal subject is always expressed by an independent
pronoun (cf. 7, 8, 10) rather than zero anaphora. This in itself is a ‘heavy’
coding device designed to mark a boundary (see §17.7.4.).
The subject constituent in clauses with an independent copula is not
postposed after the predicate. This can be explained by the fact that, as
seen in §17.1.1.2, the postposition of a topic subject constituent, is typically used as a device to bind cohesively the clause with what precedes
as a form of incidental tag. This is incompatible with the function of the
independent copula as a marker of distinctness and independence from
what precedes. An apparent exception to this is (11):
(11) r6š-kúlla d-áni ""íla S6ttìye.} ‘Above all of these is S6ttiye.’ (A25:22)
Here the inflection of the copula agrees with the noun S6ttiye and in this
respect the latter would normally be construed as the grammatical subject.
In terms of information structure, however, the initial prepositional phrase
containing the anaphoric pronoun is clearly more topical than the noun
S6ttiye, which is the asserted focus of new information.
The initial subject constituent is sometimes separated from the rest of
the clause by an intonation group boundary. This is a further prosodic
device to reinforce the prominence of the initial topic in order to give the
clause as a whole distinctness in the discourse and disjoin it from what
precedes, e.g.
(12) ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} ‘A flat-bread is thicker.’ (B6:49)
(13) Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrians.’ (B6:17)
(14) M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zìne} ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘M>mo was in
""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)
17.1.3. Deictic Copula
17.1.3.1. Basic Predicate
When the deictic copula occurs in a clause without a subject constituent,
it is normally placed before the predicate (1–3).","[867, 868, 869, 870, 871]"
"the syntax of verbs621(4) mèra †¬a°á dèwe,} tré-m6nna q†ìl6lla} ""u-""o-xéna mßurbíy6lle gu-dêmma} ""u-rìq5le

díya q6m-šaqlêxle.} ""áy pìšla.} ‘ “Do you remember the couple that we
brought together?” “Yes”. He said “and in the end we took her
betrothed and she remained alive.” ’ (A4:45)
Examples of q†ilwale preterites are found also in some poetry texts of the
corpus, e.g.
(8) xa-‘arxona ‘rixwala} kribta kribta l-ßadr6t g6ppa wirwala} ‘u m6ndi la xzewala}
‘She took a short turn around. Very angry she went back into the
cave. She saw nothing.’ (A51:12)
The q†ilwale form is rarely found in the narrative sections of the stories
of the text corpus. In cases where it is used, it expresses an event that is
not sequential to the verb in the main narrative line that precedes it. It
occurred prior to it (9–10) or, in some cases, overlapped with it temporally
(11). Although the form can often be felicitously translated by the English
pluperfect, it is important to note that it expresses an event and not a
resultant state. Any resultant state is only an implicature not a component of its meaning. When the speaker wishes to express a resultant state
directly, the compound construction consisting of the resultative participle
and the past copula is used (§15.4.1.):622chapter fifteen(9)dèrya ""íðe b-bròn-dìye.} bròn-díye qìmwale.} mère ha-bábi mò b8y6t?} ‘He put
his hand on his son. His son had woken up (at some point prior
to this, implying that he was at that point awake). He said “Hey,
father, what do you want?” ’ (A9:6)
(10) kút-yoma ßàle,} wíðwale xa-dúk°a m†ašéwa tàma.} ‘Every day he would

(11) n‘ílt6lle rèše-w} rùše-w} kúlla rupˆ°6lla.} ""áp-""aw mìtwale} har-a-dàna.} ‘She
pulled its head and its shoulder apart and threw everything down.
At the same time he also died.’ (A12:53)
15.3. The Verb ‘to be’
The verb ‘to be’ can be expressed in various ways. These include the basic
copula, the deictic copula, the existential particle and a form of the verb
hwy. In general, these perform different functions. The factors that determine which particular form is used include the semantic and information
status of the predicate and subject components and the communicative
salience of the proposition expressed by the clause as a whole.
15.3.1. The Present Basic Copula
The present basic copula exists in two forms, enclitic and independent.
These must be distinguished when determining its function. The position
of the enclitic copula in the clause must also be taken into account. In the
majority of cases the enclitic form is attached to the end of the predicate,
e.g. brónux spày-ile} ‘Your son is good’, though in some circumstances it is
attached to the subject, e.g. ""áw-ile spày} ‘He is good’. The independent
form bears its own stress and typically occurs between the subject and
predicate, e.g. brónux ""íle xàwri} ‘Your son is my friend’.
15.3.1.1. Enclitic Copula Attached to the Predicate
The enclitic copula attached to the predicate may be regarded as the
functionally unmarked form of the basic copula. It is used irrespective
of the time stability of the predicate. The predicate may express a permanent property of the subject, e.g. brónux spày-ile} ‘Your son is good’. It
may identify the referent of the subject with that of the nominal of the
predicate, which is typically a permanent relationship, e.g. "">wáha gáw‰a
bròn6n-ile} ‘That man is our son’. The predicate may also express a contin-the syntax of verbs623gent situation that is not necessarily a permanent property of the subject,
e.g. brónux kpìn5le} ‘Your son is hungry’. Examples from the text corpus:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""á°‰a rába basìm5le.} ‘The country is very beautiful.’ (B5:148)
""ána †axàn5w6n.} ‘I am a miller.’ (A32:10)
bráta zamàrt5la.} ‘The girl is a singer.’ (A25:68)
hadíya ""áti màlk6n-it} ‘Now you are our king.’ (A14:46)
ßíw6n dìy6n-ile.} ‘It is our border.’ (A14:48)
""ána 'Abda-Ra˙m?n-iw6n.} ‘I am Abda Ra˙màn.’ (A23:26)
rába k‘ìx5w6n.} ‘I am very tired.’ (A18:32)
xòðiw6n.} ‘I am by myself.’ (A22:32)
‘íd5w6t ""aßèrta †la-xa-ràmša.} ‘You are invited in the evening to dinner.’ (A22:17)The predicate may be combined with the particles heš ‘still’ and har ‘already,
still’, which demonstrate that the situation is not permanent, implying an
end-point or starting-point, e.g.
(10) brónux héš kpìn5le.} ‘Your son is still hungry.’
(11) brónux hár kpìn5le.} ‘Your son is already hungry.’
(12) ""áw héš màlk5le.} ‘He is still king.’
(13) ""áw hár màlk5le.} ‘He is already king.’
When expressing a contingent situation the enclitic copula is occasionally
combined with the deictic copula, e.g.
(14) hóle qúrb6t nùr5le.} ‘He is near to the fire.’ (A23:9)
It is unmarked with regard to the referential nature of the subject argument, in that it is used both with subjects that have a specific referent, as
is the case in examples adduced so far, and also with those that denote a
generic class, as in (15)–(16):
(15) gilándi rába gò‰5le.} ‘The scythe is very big.’ (B5:143)
(16) jawètta t-prêzl5la.} ‘The sickle is made of iron.’ (B5:140)
The construction exhibits functional unmarkedness with regard to the topical status of the subject. The subject is normally definite, i.e. its referent
is identifiable, but there is no restriction on the topicality of the subject
referent. The topicality of this referent depends on the degree to which it624chapter fifteenhas been evoked in the immediately preceding discourse or in the speech
situation. If it has been explicity mentioned in the immediately preceding
discourse, it is high in topicality, e.g.
(17) ""ána xzéli brònux.} brónux spày-ile.} ‘I have seen your son. Your son is
good.’
Such nominals can be pronominalized, e.g.
(18) ""ána xzéli brònux.} ""áw spày-ile.} ‘I have seen your son. He is good.’
A nominal may also be definite, with an identifiable referent, by virtue of
the fact that it is anchored to the preceding discourse by a some element
within it, such as a pronominal suffix or an annexed noun with a referent
that has been evoked previously, although the referent of the nominal itself
has not been evoked. In such cases the nominal is lower in topicality and
cannot be pronominalized, e.g.
(19) kut-šéta y-áz6n l-mà°a.} náš6t má°a spày-ila.} yawíli féke m6n-k5rmàne.}
‘Every year I go to the village. The people of the village are good.
They give me fruit from the orchards.’
A nominal may also be definite by virtue of the fact that it is inferable as
being a component associated with the situation evoked in the preceding
discourse, although it is not specifically mentioned in it. Also in such cases
it is lower in topicality, arguably lower even than when anchored, and
cannot be pronominalized, e.g.
(20) kut-šéta y-áz6n l-mà°a.} náše spày-ila.} yawíli féke m6n-k5rmàne.} ‘Every
year I go to the village. The people are good. They give me fruit
from the orchards.’
This topicality scale of definite nominals may be summarzied by the
following hierarchy, in which the symbol > denotes ‘of higher topicality
than’:
Explicitly mentioned > Anchored > Inferable
First and second person pronouns are high in topicality by virtue of the
fact that their referents are given in the speech situation, e.g.","[659, 660, 661, 662, 663]"
"204chapter eightThe verbal noun has various patterns. These include CCeta and CCata,
which have developed from *CCa""ta (§2.5.2.), e.g. jmeta ‘gathering’, zrata
‘agriculture’, and CC5°a, which is the pattern of final /y/ verbal nouns,
e.g. šm5°a ‘hearing’.
The verbal root zd"" ‘to fear’ has an alternative form zdl with final /l/.
This is likely to have arisen by reanalysis of a form such as zda""6lle ‘He
fears him’. In fast speech this sometimes contracts to [zdalle] by the elision of the laryngal /""/ (§4.4.) The form [zdalle] could also be interpreted
as the result of the contraction of a form such as zdal6lle, by the process
whereby the first of a sequence of two syllables beginning with the same
consonant is elided (§4.5.1.).
8.12.3. Verba Primae /y/
This category includes the verb yðl ‘to give birth, to lay (eggs)’.
The /y/ of the root is retained in the inflections of the present base:
yádla ‘She gives birth’, yádli ‘They give birth’. Note that the fricative /ð/
of the root shifts to the stop /d/ when in contact with the /l/.
The /y/ is elided in other bases. Past base: ðilla ‘She gave birth’. Resultative participle: ðílta (fs.), ðíle (pl.). Compound form: hóla ðílta ‘She has
given birth’. Imperative: ðúl (sing.), ðúlu (pl.). Infinitive: ðála. Compound
form: hóla ðála ‘She is giving birth’. Verbal noun: ðalta.
Most initial /y/ roots have shifted to the category of initial /""/ verbs,
e.g. *yqð > ""qð ‘to burn’, *yqr > ""qr ‘to be expensive’, *ysq > ""sq ‘to ascend’
(§8.12.1.).
8.12.4. Verba Primae /y/, Tertiae /""/
This category includes the verb yð"" ‘to know’.
The initial /y/ is preserved in the present base, which is inflected like
other final /""/ verbs with a short /a/ throughout the paradigm (§8.12.2.):
y8ðe ‘He knows, y8ða ‘She knows’, y8ði ‘They know’. The short /a/ of
the first syllable is sometimes attenuated to short /6/, though this is not
represented in the transcription. The attenuation is particularly common
in the 1st and 2nd person forms, e.g. y8ð6n [}j6ð6n] ‘I (m. and f.) know’,
y8ð6t [}j6ð6t] ‘You (ms. and fs.) know’. When combined with the negative
particle la, the vowel of this particle and the initial syllable of the verb
contract to /5/. This is especially common in the 1st sing. form l7ð6n ‘I
do not know’ < la-y>ð6n. An alternative negative form is míð6n ‘I do notverbs205know’, which has resulted from contraction of an interrogative particle:
míð6n < mo y>ð6n (§7.5.).
The initial /y/ is elided in other bases, which are otherwise inflected
like final /""/ verbs. Past base: ði- (ms.), ðiya- (fs.), ðiyi-, e.g. ðíle ‘He knew
him’, ðiyále ‘He knew her’, ðiyíle ‘He knew them’. Resultative participle: ðíya
(ms.), ðíta (fs.), ðíye (pl.). Compound forms: ðíy5le ‘He has known’, ðít5la ‘She
has known’. The imperative has the form ðu, which is used for singular
and plural, or alternatively forms with endings that are characteristic of
final /y/ verbs: ði (ms.), ða (fs.), ðo (pl.). The infinitive has the form ða""a or
ðaya. This sometimes contracts in negative compound forms, e.g. lán-ða""a
[ læn-ðæ] ‘I do not know’. Verbal noun: ðeta ‘knowing’.
8.12.5. Verba Mediae /y/
Verbs in this category include:
byx ‘to overflow’, byz ‘to pour, spill’, ‘yd ‘to invite’, ‘yk ‘to jam, pierce’, ‘yl
‘to sprout’, ‘yr ‘to turn away from, to become alienated’, óym ‘to close’,
dyl ‘to see’, dyn ‘to judge’, dyp ‘to fold’, dyq ‘to crush’, dy‰ ‘to return’,

An extraposed nominal is in principle definite with an identifiable referent.
In some cases the nominal has not been explicity mentioned, but its referent is referentially anchored in some way to a nominal in the preceding
context, as in (9), where the nominal ‘one room’ is a member of the set
of ‘two rooms’ mentioned earlier. The referent of the nominal may be a
class that is identifiable by its descriptive content alone (10)—(11):
(9) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
two rooms. In one room they slept. The other one was (for) the
animals.’ (A22:10)
(10) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘But a ladder—it is made of wood.’
(B10:60)
(11) kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a ""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle
dìye.} ‘Whoever brings me word about my son, whether he is dead
or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
When the referent of the fronted nominal has the role of direct object
in the clause, marked by a direct object pronominal suffix on the verb, as
in (12)–(15), its syntactic status is ambiguous. This is because there is a
general tendency for there to be a pronominal suffix on the verb agreeing
with a definite direct object constituent irrespective of whether the object
is placed before or after the verb (§15.13.2.1.).
(12) ""a-št7°a šat7wala t-lá mìya.} ‘They drink that drink without water.’
(B5:14)
(13) ""áy ""ilána mßaqlìwala.} ‘They decorate that tree.’ (B5:39)
(14) ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘We produced that drink there.’
(B5:11)
(15) ""o-qàmxa} m5°7wale bˆ°a.} ‘They would bring the flour back to the
house.’ (B5:16)
Although there is ambiguity on the level of syntactic structure, certain
object initial clauses possess the functional properties of extrapositional
constructions. This applies to the type of construction that has beenthe clause897referred to in §17.7.5.2. as ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses, in which
the object sets the topical frame for the clause. As we shall see, this is a
basic functional property of extraposition. It should also be noted that
the prosodic isolation of the initial object in a separate intonation group,
as in (14) and (15), is a feature common to ‘topic-orientated’ object initial
clauses and extrapositional clauses, but is rarely found in ‘event-orientated’
object initial clauses. ‘Topic-orientated’ object initial constructions with a
resumptive pronoun will be included together with extrapositional constructions in what follows.
17.8.1.2. Resumptive Element
The extraposed constituent is generally resumed in the clause by a
pronominal suffix. The suffix may be on the verb (1), a noun (2) or a
preposition (3):
(1) ""áw y-amríle xêppo.} ‘That—they call it a x6ppo.’ (B5:35)
(2) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
wood.’ (A12:39)
(3) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome.} ‘In our commuity a week is seven
days.’ (A17:13)
In some cases the resumptive element is an independent pronoun. In most
of the attested cases this is the subject of the clause, e.g.
(4) jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘The chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
(5) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse} ‘But a ladder—it is (made) of wood.’ (B10:60)
(6) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Only my eye, which saw
it—let that go to Hell.’ (A16:2)
(7) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has worked—he will eat.’ (A21:15)
Occasionally the independent resumptive pronoun is the object of the
verb, e.g.
(8) táma ""áti kut-b8y6t gór6t ""àw.} ‘There anybody you like—you can marry
him (= You can marry anybody you like).’ (A8:80)
(9) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was (some of the tobacco)
that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they threw that
away.’ (B7:17)898chapter seventeenThe resumptive element may even be a full nominal, e.g.
(10) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the cooking pot
became the mullah’s.’ (A5:10)
In (11) where the extraposed element is a generic relative phrase, the
resumptive noun has an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun:
(11) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)
In (12) an extraposed plural noun does not have any direct resumption,
but is linked to a singular noun in the clause in a set relationship:
(12) bàte} ""áxni qáßra díy6n mubnél6n šét6t xámši-w †¬à°a,} ""u-xámši-w ""àrpa.}
‘As for houses, we had our villa built in the year fifty-three and
fifty-four.’ (B1:20)
An extraposed item may be left without any explicit resumption in the
clause. In such cases the extraposed element sets the orientation of the
clause, similarly to a clause initial adverbial, without playing a syntactic
role in it.
(13) †alòbe,} béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ‘As for the betrothal—they would make
food.’ (B5:7)
(14) m5xólta y-áwa mbúšle qawúrma-w rêzza,} ""u-k6ftàne.} ‘As for the food,
they would have cooked qawurma, rice, meat-balls.’ (B5:15)
(15) palá††6t ""9raq,} t-amrèxi,} y-a°7wa m5°7wa lìne ""í°wa,} d5r7wa lìne,}
""u-d5r7wa mìya gáwa.} ‘As for the production of arak, as we would
say, they used to bring pots, they would put down the pots and
put water into them.’ (B5:12)
(16) sab-xlúla rába náše ‘5dˆwa.} ‘Because the wedding—they invited many
people.’ (B5:23)
A speaker sometimes extraposes the 1pl. independent pronoun in this way
when referring to activities in his own home or community.
(17) ""áxni b-sètwa mš7ra dúnye ràya} m6n-yárx6t ""êßra-w} xadèss6r hòd6x.} ‘We
(= in our community)—in winter it starts raining from October
and November onwards.’ (B5:145)the clause899(18) ""àxni} ""Ón-Núne npílta bel-†úra l-†ùra.} We—""“n-Nune is situated between mountains.’ (B5:148)
(19) ""áxni b7°6t be-bábi ""atìqa-wewa.} ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùlnaše.} ‘We—the house of the family of my father was old, but
it was higher than the villas of everybody (in our community).’
(B10:51)
In (20) and (21) the resumptive independent pronoun itself stands extraposed from the clause:
(20) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or anybody—he—they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
(A17:17)
(21) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—the three of
them—I have given them an appointment.’ (A22:21)
17.8.2. Function
17.8.2.1. Discourse Boundary Marking
The function of the extraposition of an item at the front of a clause is
in most cases to express some kind of boundary and reorientation in the
discourse. The initial nominal expresses the topic referent of the clause,
which often has topical status also in the following clauses. When the
initial topic is given added prominence by being prosodically separated
from the rest of the clause in a different intonation group, the degree of
disjunction from what precedes is in principle enhanced. As we have seen,
subject initial clauses and ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses also have
a disjoining function. In these constructions also the degree of disjoining
is enhanced by the prosodic separation of the initial topical constituent.
The subject constituent may be separated from the rest of the clause by
an intonation group boundary, e.g.
(1)
(2)šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
(B6:21)In copula clauses another type of prosodic separation of the initial subject topic constituent is its detachment from the copula, resulting in a900chapter seventeenconstruction such as (3). Example (4) has the same structure, with the
copula after the subject, without the prosodic separation:
(3) gèrðo ""íla m6n-màsta.} ‘G6rðo is (made) of yoghurt.’ (B5:64)
(4) xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)
It is worth noting that in some other NENA dialects, constructions that
correspond to (3) are extrapositional with an independent resumptive
pronoun attached to the copula, e.g. C. Qaraqosh:
(5) ""ójar ""áhu-l6 xa-mèndi d-gár6šl6 xmàra.} ‘The plough is something that
an ass pulls.’ (Khan 2002: 412)
The types of boundary that are expressed by extrapositional clauses in
the text corpus can be classified as follows:
(i) Beginning of Speech
A speaker often opens a speech turn with a topic referent that is accessible to the hearer. If this is not the subject of the clause, it stands in
extraposition, e.g.
(1) mère yêmmi} ""êdyo} †¬à°na} xon>wá°6t Qára Tè≥din} mopíš6lle l6bbèy.} ‘He
said “Mother, today the three brothers of Qara Te≥din—their hearts
became (angry).” ’ (A26:71)
(2) mèra ""áwwa náša f>qìra} t-awéle xá bronà.} ‘They said “This poor
man—to him will be a son (= he will have a son).” ’ (A8:3)
(3) mère xàli} xmàre,} šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwe.} ‘He said “Uncle, the
asses—the seven of them have been eaten by wolves.” ’ (A23:15)
(4) ßlélux xá-bena xèna?} gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘ “Have you
come down again?” “Your stupid club (literally: the club of your
behind)—would I have been finished off by it?” ’ (A52:17)
If the subject of the clause is a possession or attribute of the speaker or
hearer, the speech turn often begins with an extraposed 1st or 2nd person
independent pronoun respectively, e.g.
(5) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole.} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
(6) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
wood.’ (A12:39)the clause
(7)
(8)
(9)901""ána ""úrxi rába rìxt5la.} ‘I—my way is very long (= I have a long way
to go).’ (A8:42)
""áxni ""áti xà°6n-iw6t.} ‘We—you are our sister.’ (A34:16)
""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)The choice of extraposed pronoun to open the speech turn depends on
the topicality of the referent in the ensuing discourse. This is seen in (10),
in which the first clause opens with the 2s. pronoun although the grammatical subject is 1fs., since the following clauses are ‘hearer-orientated’,
containing various deontic expressions addressed to the hearer:
(10) ""áti ràba b>yánnux.} bas-msà'6dli xá‘‘a.} hálli xákma mêndi} masqánne l-bˆ°a}
""u-""aßèrta b-l7le ""á°eti kêsli.} ‘I love you a lot. Only, help me a little.
Give me something to take up to the house and tonight come to
me.’ (A22:19)
(ii) New Section of Discourse
On some occasions a construction with an initial extraposed topic referent
occurs at the onset of a section of discourse that is disjoined in some way
from what precedes. Various types of disjunction can be identified.
In (1) the extrapositional clause coincides with a shift in topic referent:
(1)xíllux táma mubsêmlux.} ""ána q6m-†arðìli.} ""è°y6n m-k7rbi hon-xíl6lla ""ày.}
‘You ate there and enjoyed yourself. I—they drove me out and,
out of my anger, I have come and eaten it.’ (A2:11)The construction is used when there is continuity of a topic referent from
the preceding discourse but disjunction on some other level. In narrative it
is used to signal the onset of an event section that is presented as separate
from the previous one:
(2)""ím6t pìdle †úra,} ßàle} ""êlt6x.} réša xtáya kúlle mêlx5le.} sùsux} ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela.} mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘When he has
crossed over the mountain, he will go down. Down hill it is all
salt. Your horse—(when) its legs have become wounded, salt will
strike his legs and he will screech.’ (A24:12)In narrative the construction is used at the onset of a section that supplies some kind of elaboration on what precedes rather than carrying the
narrative forward. In (3) it presents an event that is circumstantial to the902chapter seventeenpreviously mentioned event. The extrapositional clause in (4) provides an
evaluative comment on what precedes rather than an event that is presented as sequential to what precedes. In (5) the narrator opens a section
that shifts to a point earlier in the time-line and recounts the events that
led to the protagonist becoming blind.
(3) qíme dwíqe xá b-aw-rùše} xá b-aw-rùše} nùbl6lle.} ""áw lá snidíle ""áqle dìye}
q6m-nablìle.} ‘They held him, one this shoulder and one the other,
and took him away. His legs did not support him. They took him
away.’ (B9:24)
(4) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} xabúše muntéwala bíya dìya.} ‘They began to cultivate
apples. They were successful with apples.’ (B5:75)
(5) qám d-áyya qêßß6t} t-miràli} Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye} mèra
""èllahi magurêxlux.} ‘Before this story that I have told you (so far), the
blind David—his father and mother pressed him and said “By God,
we must marry you.” ’ (A16:5)
In (6)–(8), from descriptive discourse, the extrapositional construction
constitutes an explanatory supplement to what precedes:
(6) béna gu-d-á-dana m5°7wa štˆ°a.} ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘At
that time they brought drink. That drink—we produced it there.’
(B5:11)
(7) béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘They would make
food. The food—the family of the bride would make it.’ (B5:7)
(8) ""í°wa jawêtta.} jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘There was a chopper. The
chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
In (9) the construction is used in a clause that repeats the content of the
preceding clause as a strategy to introduce elaborative material:
(9) y-áz6xwa ""áxni zóre m†alèxwa kolàne.} koláne m†alêxwa gáwa.} mattèxwala
bé""e gu-ßawêlta.} ‘We would paint eggs. We young people would go
and play in the streets. The streets—we would play in them and
would put eggs in a shoe.’ (B16:5)
In (10) the construction coincides with a shift from a general description
of a habitual situation to the description of a specific event, which is
offered as an illustration:the clause903(10) yawíwala xà-mdi.} ""ána xmá°i xá-dawa z8ra mutt7°6lli gu-""íð6t xóni ""Ìsh6q.}
‘They would give her (the bride) something. I—my mother-in-law
put a yellow gold coin for me in the hand of my brother Ish6q.’
(B8:35)
An extrapositional construction is used after a presentative clause with
existential particles in (11) and (12). This is likely to be a strategy to mark
off the presentative clause with enhanced distinctness in order to give the
item presented added prominence:
(11) ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} †úra t-ásq6t bíye dìye,} kúlle skinyà°5le.} ‘There is a mountain. The mountain—you should go up it, it is all (covered in)
knives.’ (A24:11)
(12) ""ítl6n ""7n6t ""ùmra.} ""ay-‘ú-ga lá-q7†a-w lá-s6twa bárzi míya dìya.} trè ""5ná°a
""ítl6n.} ‘We have the spring of the church. It—its water never dries
up, in summer or winter.’ (B10:61)
Generic or proverbial statements, which have an inherent independence
and distinctness from the preceding context, may open with an initial
topic standing in extraposition, e.g.
(13) ""ó-t šawèrra šáwwa sêkke,} ða-q7°a gu-be-têkke} ‘He who jumps seven
stakes—(one stake) will hit him in his waist.’ (D2:1)
(14) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or
anybody—he, they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
(A17:17)
In clauses denoting an iterative action containing a constituent with a
universal quantifier, the quantified phrase is often made the topic of the
clause and placed in extraposition, e.g.
(15) kut-mêsta} xa-zága dáry6t bìya.} ‘Put a bell on every hair.’ (A27:8)
(16) kú-reš6t xúwwe °èle,} q6m-maxèle.} ‘He struck each head of the snake
that came (his way).’ (A24:40)
(iii) Opposition between Topics
In some cases the motivation for the extrapositional construction is to set
up an opposition or parallelism between two topic referents. Each topic904chapter seventeenreferent is placed at the front of the clause and stands in extraposition if
it is not the subject referent, e.g.
(1) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
""6štà-yomela?} ‘We—a week for us is seven days and a month is thirty
days. You—is your week six weeks?’ (A17:13)
(2) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
two rooms. One room—they slept in it. The other one—it was (for)
the animals.’ (A22:10)
(3) zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ""u-màsta} ""áxl6t mènna qrúšta díya t-la-xàrwa.}
‘The pittas—you should eat them without breaking them. The
yoghurt—you should eat it without the crust being spoilt.’ (A30:5)
(4) ""ína júllux hálla †làli.} ""u-xmártux t-átw6n ""àna l-xáßa.} ‘Your clothes—give
them to me. Your donkey—I shall sit on its back.’ (A6:8)
In (5) and (6) the extraposition of the topical subject constituent by means
of an independent pronoun is used to mark it off distinctly from a topic
of an adjacent clause:
(5) d>ráje t-kèp5la,} ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘Steps are made of stone, but
a ladder—it is made of wood.’ (B10:60)
(6) ""ánna qurðáye barzanàye} ""áni hóla jrà†a.} ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a.} ‘The Barzan
Kurds were slipping, but the Christians were not slipping.’ (B19:7)
(iv) Prominence of Clause
In some cases the main motivation for an extrapositional construction
with a clause initial topic is to mark it off distinctly from what precedes
in order to give it prominence, e.g.
(1) °éle xa-hambišàya.} hambišàya} ""ˆ-ga} xír5le bìye,} ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle!} ‘A
giant came. The giant looked at him. That man’s heart burst (with
fear).’ (A31:2)
(2) lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ""áxni har-xòn6n-it!} ‘We do not want
water or anything else. You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)
In (3) the extrapositional clause marks the climactic point of the discourse
section, the origin of the name of the church being the main point of
the narrative:the clause905(3) gu-d-ò-""umra} †ùmr6lle} ""u-bènyela ""úmra b-réše dìye.} ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye
Mar-Sàwa.} ‘They buried him in (the site of) that church and built the
church over him. They gave it the name of Saint Sawa.’ (B6:30)
17.8.2.2. Topic Referents Obligatorily Resumed by L-Suffixes
In certain clauses, an initial topic referent regularly stands in extraposition
and is resumed on the verb by an L-suffix. These include the following:
(i) ‘Naming’ Constructions with the Verb ""mr
(1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
(2) ""áyya y-amrèxla m>màðta.} ‘This—we call it baptism.’ (B6:8)
(3) ""áni xa†oryà°a y-amríla.} ‘They are called “washing-boards.” ’ (B19:9)
(ii) Possessive Constructions with the Existential Particle
(4) ßlí°5la bàxta} xzí°a qa-màlla.} málla ""ítle d6kkán6t ""aparù°a.} ‘The woman
went down (to the town) and saw the mullah. The mullah had a
shop of household goods.’ (A22:11)
(5) ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya.} ‘He has a room like this one.’ (A21:5)
(6) ""àxni} gu-""Ón-Nùne} ""ítl6n šèra.} ‘We in ""“n-Nune have a saint’s festival.’
(B5:72)
(iii) Clauses Containing Verbs with Impersonal Subjects
(7) "">wáha t-ile xóðe díye b>yéle bàxta.} ‘The man who is alone needs a
wife.’ (A27:7)
17.8.2.3. Narrow focus
In some cases the nuclear stress is placed on an independent pronoun
that resumes an extraposed nominal phrase. This puts narrow focus on
the referent. The construction is typically used when the nominal is a
long phrase, e.g.
(1) kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ""o-t-pàl6x} ""àw t-áx6l.}
‘Whoever does not work in this house will not eat food. Whoever
works—he (and not anybody else) will eat.’ (A21:13)
(2) qa-mó g8r6g ""áz6l kúlla páxri gu-nùra,} gu-jahànnam?} bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày
xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Why should all my body go to the fire, to
Hell? Only my eye that saw it—let it go to Hell.’ (A16:2)906chapter seventeen
17.9. Miscellaneous Clausal Particles17.9.1. n6mu/l6mu
This particle gives an expostulatory or hortatory sense to questions. When
used to introduce negative questions, which is its most frequent usage, the
question is equivalent in function to an asseveration, e.g.
(1) nèmu la-mèri-llux dày6‰,} mí°a dày6‰?} ‘Did I not tell you that he would
return (= indeed I told you . . .), that the dead would return?’
(A22:39)
(2) nèmu ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘At
the wedding of Gw6rg6s did not my aunt buy his cake and say
“(I buy it) for a beehive? (= indeed my aunt bought his cake . . .)” ’
(B8:29–30)
(3) nèmu la-""awðèxle ""áwwa †ùra} d>rajyà°a,} d>ràje,} t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?}
‘Should we not make for this mountain steps (= indeed let us
make . . .), so that we can go up the mountain?’ (A17:4)
(4) lèmu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} ‘Should I not go? (= indeed I should go)’
(A39:10)
(5) lèmu lax-xnìq6llux?} ‘Have we not drowned you? (= surely we have
drowned you)’ (A7:22)
Occasionally the most appropriate translation of the particle is ‘why?’,
e.g.
(6) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmu
la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)
The particle is occasionally used in positive questions, where it has a
remonstrating force, e.g.
(7) nèmu ""áyya bèrke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
you are swimming? (= surely it is mine not yours)’ (A25:61)
17.9.2. xo-/xuThis particle, which is related etymologically to Syriac k∫ar, is used most
frequently in negated clauses. When used in non-interrogative clauses, it
intensifies the negation, often with a remonstrating force, e.g.","[934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945]"

(A20:6)
Further examples from non-narrative discourse in the text corpus are
presented in (43)–(48), in most of which the copula is negative or is a
clitic attached to a subordinating particle. Note that in (45)–(47) the construction is used in combination with the qa†6lwa form and in (48) with
the resultative form.
(43) ""6n-la-ß5mèxla m9r6x.} ""áxni gò‰e,} bas-""ánna bnóne zòre} hadíya lˆla ßyám6lla

""abàya y-amrèxwale.} ‘When they took it to the threshing floor from

‘Today, everything that I hear here, my mother has told me and
I know it.’ (B8:15)
On some occasions the deictic copula is used with the infinitive when it
has an iterative usage. As with the narrative usage, the motivation for the
deictic copula is generally to direct particular attention to a clause that
occurs at some kind of boundary in the discourse. In (49)–(51) the deictic
copula occurs at the onset of a segment of discourse. Example (49) is the
opening of a section of direct speech and (50) coincides with a shift in
subject referent and also a temporal shift marked by the adverb ‘now’. In
(51) the deictic copula occurs at the onset of a chain of clauses in which
there is a shift in subject referent. The situation described in this chainthe syntax of verbs717of clauses also has prominence in the overall narrative, and this may be
an additional motivation for drawing attention to it by the deictic copula.
In (52) the deictic copula gives weight to the closing clause in a section
describing the iterative situation in which a certain character in the narrative sings. The infinitive here has the b- preposition, the motivation for
which here may also be to give the clause additional morphological end
weighting.

‘When he sings, nightingales gather at his voice and the leaves of

15.4.2.5. Performative Function
The infinitive construction is used in some performative verbs, which
perform an action by their utterance rather than make a truth-evaluable
description of a situation. In this function the construction has a perfective
aspect, as in the narrative present and iterative functions. Characteristically of its perfective use elsewhere, there is a greater tendency to use the
enclitic copula than when it expresses progressive aspect. Performative
usage is attested in the verb mqawole ‘to promise’, e.g.
(1)mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)The expression ‘I say to you’ in contexts such (2)–(4) also has a performative function, which no doubt explains why it is used with an enclitic
copula:
(2)
(3)már6nnux plú† m-àxxa.} ‘I say to you: Leave here!’ (A12:5)
màr6nnux} ""áti grùš gánux.} ‘I say to you: Go away!’ (A12:10)718chapter fifteen(4) w-áti mò t-amrètli?} mère ""ána mar6n-êllux} hé d°s,} ""í°walux ""o-kàrma.}
‘ “What will you say to me?” He said “I say to you: Yes, it’s true,
you had that orchard.” ’ (A17:33–34)
15.4.2.6. Movement of the Enclitic Copula
The positive clitic copula of the construction may be moved to a constituent that occurs before or after the infinitive in the same types of
environment that condition the movement of the copula in the resultative construction described in §15.4.1.4. This can be seen in several of
the examples cited already above. Further examples classified into their
various functional types are:
15.4.2.6.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic
(i) Narrow Information Focus
(1) ""àtit wáða ""ixála?} ‘Are you making food (not somebody else)?’
(A21:27)
(2) ""ána spayù°6n wáða.} ‘I am doing good (not bad).’ (A14:34)
(3) ""áw xšíwa mêšx5le ßláya m6n-káde.} ‘He thought that oil (not urine) was
running down from the kade cakes.’ (A30:47)
(4) m-ˆk6t °áya?} b-álaha m-bˆ°6n °áya.} ‘Where are you coming from? By
God, I am coming from home.’ (A23:2)
(5) ""ána míya m-""ˆw6n štáya.} ‘I drink water (even) from the clouds.’
(A26:34)
(6) díya bìš-ila ma°óy6lla,} bìš-ila hawèlla.} ‘Now they bring them more,
they give them more.’ (B10:40)
(7) ""ána hàden plá†a} ‘I am just now going out (to work)’. (A23:11)
(ii) Topically Prominent Constituent
(1) lat-mtaxmóne ""áwwa qàßra} t-íle kúlle qarqupyà°a?} xa-qarqúp°5la pyáša qarèšux.} ‘Don’t you think about this palace, which is all skulls. One
(space for) a skull is remaining for your head.’ (A25:60)
(2) ""áxnix pyáša xêzme.} ‘We are becoming relatives.’ (B5:9)
(iii) Interrogative Constituents
(1) lˆk6x zála?} ‘Where are we going?’ (A26:16)
(2) lék5w6t b-zàla?} ‘Where are you going?’ (A8:64)the syntax of verbs719(3) ""áti mòt wáða táma?} ‘What are you doing there?’ (A25:60)
(4) ""áyya m9nile mtanóy6lla?} ‘Who is telling this?’ (A14:53)
(5) ta-mòt mára hátxa?} ‘Why are you saying that?’ (A40:2)
(iv) Subordinating Conjunctions
(1) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manšènna hál yom6tmàw°a.} ‘I shall not abandon until the day I die the way that I am
following now.’ (A21:35)
(2) ""o-kèlša d5r7wale gu-juwàle,} m5°7wale l-mà°a,} xzí ""7k5le b7°ux t-it-bnày6lle.}
‘They put the gypsum in sacks and brought it to the village, wherever (literally: see where) your house that you were building was
situated.’ (B5:184)
(3) ""u-béna ""íman t-ila-pyáša gò‰e} xá‘‘a šúla biš-zàm6t-ile.} ‘When they become
big, the work is a little more difficult.’ (B5:105)
15.4.2.6.2. Rightward Movement of the Enclitic
This is found only where the construction is used with a perfective aspect,
either to express a narrative present or an iterative event, i.e. where it is
common to have an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. As in the resultative construction, the purpose of the rightward movement onto the final
item of the predicate is to give prominence, but not narrow information
focus, either to the item to which it is attached or to the clause as a whole.
In the examples attested in the text corpus, the construction is used to give
added prominence to the clause in order to signal some kind of boundary
in the discourse, marking off the clause from what precedes or follows.
In (1) the clause describing the tying of the bands marks the closure of
the chain of events in the marriage ceremony. In (2) the construction
occurs at the beginning of a segment of discourse that presents elaborative information on what precedes. In (3) the construction separates the
second clause distinctly from the first to express a contrastive opposition
between the action of Barz6kko and that of his companions.
(1) bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le qàša} ""u-sá‰a
gnùn5le.} ‘After the woman becomes official there, that is she enters
the house, the priest comes and ties the band.’ (B5:44)
(2) ""u-béna ""íman t-ila-pyáša gò‰e} xá‘‘a šúla biš-zàm6t-ile.} l6""ánnahu pyáša
gò‰t5la} mtagbárta díya biš-ràb5la,} ""u-g8r6g rába ""áxl6t xàm.} ‘When they
become big, the work is a little more difficult. This is because, when720chapter fifteenthey become big, the job to maintain them is bigger, and you must
be very careful.’ (B5:105)
(3) ""ánna kúlla dmàx5la.} Barzèkko pyáša ˙àr6s-ile.} ‘They all went to sleep.
Barz6kko became the guard.’ (A12:9)
15.4.2.7. Infinitive Combined with the Past Copula
The infinitive may be combined with the past copula (for the morphology
of this compound form see §8.19.4.5.). This expresses the past progressive.
It is typically used in narrative to denote an action or situation that was
in progress in the past and overlapped temporally with the occurrence
of a punctual event, e.g.
(1) zàl5wa,} xá-bena xzéle m-rè˙qa xá-mdi xwàra.} ‘As he was going along,
he suddenly saw from afar something white.’ (A14:28)
(2) xà-yoma} dèbba xðára-wawa gu-†uràne.} tfíqla b-xa-tèla.} ‘One day a bear
was wandering around the mountains. She met a fox.’ (A20:1)
(3) xðár6nwa l-ày-goti,} ""áqli tíwla š-""áql6t bàxta.} ‘I was turning over to
my (other) side and my leg settled on the leg of the woman.’
(A16:11)
(4) mèr6x ""èlla mtanìla} ""u-xa-mašmóye-wewa ""6llˆni láz6m.} ‘You said “You must
tell it” and somebody must have been listening to us.’ (A35:19)
(5) m>‰òy6nwala,} gu-ðà-"">ra.} . . . q6m-maxyále púmma díya l-rêzza} ‘I was
grazing it in a certain piece of land. . . . It put its mouth in the rice.’
(B5:131)
Note the preposing of the copula before the infinitive when the construction is combined with the particle har ‘still’ in (6). This can be compared
to the leftward movement of the copula onto initial adverbials in other
types of compound verbal constructions (e.g. yóma hádele zrìqa} ‘The sun
has just now risen’ §15.4.1.4.1. example 30):
(6) píšle yòma} hár-wewa xðàra,} xzéle xa-b6ßlíßa zòra.} ‘Day came and he was
still searching about, when he saw a small ray of light.’ (A14:24)
If two or more infinitives are concatenated, the copula may be omitted
after its use on the first one of the series, e.g.
(7) zílla xákma šênne,} málka hár xzàya-wewa,} b-xzáya mbaqóre l-d-ò-naša.}
‘Several years went by (during which) the king was investigating and
inquiring concerning the man.’ (A8:5)the syntax of verbs
(8)721xéna ""ánna kúlley,} lá baxtá°a pyáša-w5wa yaqùre,} lá bnòne} ""èzze ma°òye,} lá
""arxà°a.} ‘But all of these—the women were not becomng pregnant,
the goats were not producing young, the mills were not (producing).’ (A38:1)The temporal overlap function of the form is used in (9) to present an
explanation of a previous statement of a character in the narrative:
(9)màr5wa} har-""àww5le} ""6n-""ítle nawàge.} ‘He was saying (he meant by
this) “Is he just him (alone) or does he have grandchildren?” ’
(A17:16)The construction is used in non-narrative discourse to express the temporal
overlap of an action with iterative events in the past. In the cases where
this is attested in the text corpus the copula is placed before the infinitive.
In §15.3.6. it has been shown that clauses in which the past copula is
placed before the predicate express in principle some kind of communicative salience. This is likely to be the case here, since in both examples
two clauses with the infinitive construction are set up in opposition. The
preposing of the copula is used to mark off the two clauses distinctly from
one another. Another factor for the preposing of the copula in the phrase
har-iwa-práma of (10) may be the particle har, as is the case in (6) above:
(10) ""áy mòdi q†á""a †árpa?} q>†ìwale,} xá har-iwa-práma zdáya l-9ra-w} ""an-xéne
""iyáwa bá°re bá°re wáða †àxe} ‘What is the cutting down of leaves?
They cut them down, one person cutting and throwing them on
the ground, while others were behind him making small piles.’
(B5:118)
(11) m-bar-hàd6x} q5mìwa} mzabóne ""ilàna.} náše ""íwa kòpa} kùlla,} ""u-""áwwa
gárewa ràma.} ""áwwa náše ""iy7wa kúlla spára kòpa.} ""a-""ilána mzabnìwala
y-amrèxxa.} ‘After that they would sell the tree. The people were all
below and he (the groom) was high up on the roof, all the people
were waiting below. They sold the tree, as we say.’ (B5:42)
Note also (12), in which the temporal overlap function with an ongoing
situation is used to express a concessive sense. The ongoing negated situation can be considered to be iterative (‘on no occasion have they asked
for you’):
(12) hadíya xon>wà°ux,} már6twa xon>wà°i,} ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa
l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘Now your brothers—(although) you called (them)722chapter fifteen
“my brothers”, it has been a year that they have been here but
have not (even once) asked for you.’ (A26:78)As is the case with the present copula, the motivation for the preposing
of the past copula is sometimes to cliticize it to constituents of the clause
that stand before the infinitive. In (13) and (14), for example, it is cliticized
to the subordinating particle D:
(13) ""án-zuz6t ""a°íwa m6n-mzabánt6t ""ilàna} ""íwa hayàrta} qa-k yálo-w xêtna} t-íwa
gwàra.} ‘The money that was received from the sale of the house
was assistance for the bride and groom who were getting married.’
(B15:67)
(14) madàm t-iwètwa pláxa ""átxa m6ndiyáne} t-amrènnux mò-""oð6t?} ‘Since
you have been doing such things, should I tell you what to do?’
(A14:79)
15.4.2.8. Infinitive Combined with the Verb hwy
The copula in the infinitive construction may be replaced by various
inflections of the verb hwy in certain contexts. The following forms are
attested in the text corpus.
15.4.2.8.1. hawe q†ala
This form is found in the protasis of conditional constructions referring
to a progressive action that overlaps temporally with that of the apodosis,
e.g.
(1)""6n-háwe plá†a m6n-""èrxe †íša qàmxa,} lá h>mèn6t ""êlle.} ‘If he is coming
out of the water-mill covered in flour, do not trust him.’ (D2:61)15.4.2.8.2. y-awe q†ala
This is found in (1), where it expresses a habitual progressive, denoting an
activity that was habitually in progress and overlapping temporally with
another activity or situation. The construction here has past time reference by taking the past reference of the verbs in the preceding context
as its deictic centre:
(1)sab-xa-xa-gáye ""i-maxéwa tmanyà sa""êtte} bar-©ðáðe t-là-kl5°a.} tmanyá sa""ètte
y-áwa mxàya} ""u-náše dwìqe.} ‘For, sometimes, they played for eight
hours continuously without stopping. They would be playing for
eight hours while the people held (each other).’ (B15:77)the syntax of verbs72315.4.2.8.3. y-awewa q†ala
This form expresses a habitual progressive in the past. In (1)–(3) it is used
to denote an activity that habitually overlapped with another activity or
situation:
(1) ßalènwa y-awéwa rxà°a.} ‘I would go down while it was fermenting.’
(B5:212)
(2) ""í°wa †awalyá°a rábe ràbe} m†alìwa.} ""ò yóma} kúlle yòma} y-awáwa m†awòle}
""u-náš6t má°a kùlla} síqe mparóje biyèy.} ‘There were many games that
they played. They would be playing all that day and (while they
were doing so) all the people of the village would go up to look at
them.’ (B7:4)
(3) béna bálki ""o-nàša,} ""o-xêtna t-ámr6x,} ""o-""ùrza,} lˆwe táma.} y-awéwa pláxa
gu-mðinà°a m8°>lan.} ‘Perhaps the person, that is the groom, the
man, was not there. He was working (at that time) in the towns,
for example.’ (B5:18)
In (4) and (5) it is used to express a habitual activity that was temporally
delimited. The end of this activity is mentioned in the context. In (4) the
people in question ceased to worship God when they had a son. In (5)
the habitual bad behaviour of the child at school was short-lived since
we are told in the following context that he was expelled:
(4) hál xámši-w xámša šênne} y-aw7wa sxáða ""alàha,} y-ám6r ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n
xa-bròna.} ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} šuréla manšóy6lle ""alàha,} là txára
""álaha,} ""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha.} ‘For fifty-five years they were worshipping God, he (the man) would say “Oh God, give us a son.”
When God gave them a son, they began to forget God, they did
not remember God and did not pray to God.’ (A15:17)
(5) qímla mšodèrra bròn-díya m6dràsa.} bróna díya gu-m6drása kút-yum y-awéwa
mxáya l-aw-yàla,} šqála ‘ánta d-àwwa,} šrà†a m6ndiyáne.} ‘She sent her
son to school. Her son everyday in school would beat one child,
take the bag of another, tear things.’ (A14:5)
15.4.2.8.4. t-awe q†ala
This construction is formed by combining the future b6d-qa†6l form of hwy
with the infinitive. In most cases it expresses a future progressive. It may
be used to denote an activity that will be in progress when a perfective
future action takes place, e.g.","[754, 755, 756, 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 762]"

(7) max6ðríla ""a-k yàlo.} ‘They caused the bride to go around (the village).’
(B5:38)
(8) madoqíla xètna-w k yálo gota-©ðàðe.} ‘They make the groom and bride
hold each other’s side.’ (B5:50)
(9) ""èdyo maštènn5xu št7°a dìy6n} t-in-wíð6lla ""àna.} ‘Today I shall give you
our drink to drink, which I have made.’ (B15:57)
(10) hátxa m>l6pètli ˙aqqú°a ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘You should teach me what is
lawful and what is unlawful.’ (A15:10)
15.14. Indirect Objects
A nominal that has the function of the indirect object of an action, i.e.
one that refers to a participant who is a recipient or beneficiary in the
action, is expressed by attaching the preposition †la-/ta- or qa-. Unlike
direct object nominals, indirect object nominals normally do not have
any agreement element in the form of a pronominal copy on the verb,
even when the noun is definite, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l têrte tawriyá°a.} ‘He will give to your neighbour
two cows.’ (A3:4)
tèmm6l t-ámr6n ta-bàbi.} ‘Tomorrow I shall tell my father.’ (A18:7)
mèrt5la †la-d-áw-naša sáwa puš-b-šˆna!} ‘She said to that old man
“Remain in peace!” ’ (A8:69)On some rare occasions an agreement L-suffix is attested on the verb,
e.g.
(4)""ána t-àz6n} tanyánne ða-tuní°a †la-màlka.} ‘I shall go and tell a story
to the king.’ (A36:2)the syntax of verbs787As already described in §8.19.5., a pronominal indirect object of a verb
may be expressed by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase
consisting of the prepositions ""6ll-, †la- or qa- and a pronominal suffix. With
past base verbs the pronominal indirect object may also be expressed by
the inflection of the past base, e.g. mirále ‘He said to her’. Here we shall
examine in greater detail the distribution of these alternative devices in
the text corpus.
When there is no direct object, the pronominal indirect object may
usually be expressed either by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase. In such cases the ‘heavier’ prepositional phrase tends to be
used at the end of an intonation group (7–9) and avoided in the middle
of an intonation group following the verb (5–6). Included here are verbs
of saying followed by direct or indirect speech:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""álaha yállux b-àyya dúnye} ""u-b-5-xèta.} ‘May God grant you (bounty)
in this world and the next.’ (A21:44)
xáli lá ""amrètli qèßß6t d-áwwa qáßra mòdila?} ‘Uncle, will you not tell
me what the story of this palace is?’ (A25:67)
""ám6r ""èlle dìye.} ‘He says to him.’ (A21:2)
t-ámreti †làli.} ‘Tell me.’ (A21:43)
""ána mar6n-êllux.} ‘I say to you.’ (A17:34)A compound verbal form consisting of a resultative participle or an
infinitive without a clitic copula never takes L-suffixes. It usually takes a
cliticized ""6ll-phrase, e.g. hon híw6lle ‘I have given to him’, hon yaw6lle ‘I am
giving to him’. At the end of an intonation group this may be replaced
by an independent prepositional phrase with its own stress, e.g.
(10) hóle mára †làli.} ‘He says to me.’ (A17:10)
(11) ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi.} ‘She has been given to me.’ (A25:39)
When the verb has both a pronominal direct object and a pronominal
indirect object, the direct object is normally the primary object affix on
the verb and the indirect object is expressed by a prepositional adjunct
phrase, which in most cases follows the direct object affix, e.g.
(12) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ‘Let’s look for a
man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
(13) ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)788chapter fifteen(14) á¬óla sámma-w hallùle-lle.} ‘Fill it with poison and give it to him.’
(A26:86)
(15) b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} ‘Will you sell it to me if it has one
leg?’ (A22:5)
(16) xúwwe mà t-áw6ð b-an-álpa dáwe,} t-áz6n hawènna ""6lle-dìye?!} ‘What will
the snake do with the thousand gold coins that I should go and
give them to him?!’ (A1:8)
(17) xà°i,} Zìne,} hiwála ""êlli.} ‘My sister, Zine gave it to me.’ (A26:38)
(18) ""ána t-amrênna-llux.} ‘I shall tell it to you.’ (A21:35)
When the verb has a definite direct object nominal, this generally takes
an agreement in the form of a direct object pronominal affix and a pronominal indirect object must be expressed by an independent prepositional
phrase, which generally follows, e.g.
(19) bas-yátla Náze ""êlli.} ‘But you must give Naze to me.’ (A25:23)
(20) qá-mo le-yátla xá°ux ""êlle?} ‘Why won’t you give your sister to him?’
(A26:72)
(21) ""ána sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu.} ‘I shall give my portion to you.’ (A21:29)
(22) t8ra la-pa°xètle ""èlle dìye.} ‘Do not open the door to him.’ (A23:25)
(23) ""áwwa yála yíw6lle ""álaha ""èlla díya ""6štà yárxe.} ‘God gave them this
child six months ago.’ (A15:9)
In (24) there is a deviation from this usual rule, in that the indirect pronominal object is expressed by an L-suffix on the verb before the L-suffix
that agrees with the direct object nominal:
(24) hállila masr6q°ònti} ‘Give me my little comb’ (A34:3)
Occasionally a textually prominent indefinite direct object nominal takes
an agreement pronoun, e.g.
(25) ""áp-""awwa šaqèlla ðá-k6sta qa-d-ày,} yawèlla qa-d-ày.} ‘He also takes a
purse for her and gives it to her.’ (A4:22)
When a direct object nominal has no object agreement on the verb, the
pronominal indirect object is the primary affix on the verb, which is an
L-suffix in verb forms that take L-suffixes. The main circumstances in which
the direct object agreement element is omitted include the following:the syntax of verbs789(i) An indefinite direct object nominal
(26) ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n xa-bròna.} ‘Oh God, give us a son.’ (A15:17)
(27) hállule xa-sùsa.} ‘Give him a horse.’ (A12:59)
(28) mattúli xá-š6mma xèna.} ‘Give me another name.’ (A7:2)
(29) q7m6n šaqlènni xákma mèndi mènni b-""ìði.} ‘I shall get up and take for
myself a few things, with me in my hand.’ (A23:5)
(30) b>yánni ""èmma bnà°a.} ‘I want for myself a hundred girls.’ (A25:74)
(ii) A definite direct object that is an inalienable possession or closely
associated appurtenance of the referent of the indirect object
(31) híw6lla jùlla.} ‘He gave her clothes to her.’ (A14:84)
(32) hot-yàw6lle rèsqe díye} hóle xàla.} ""áp-""ana ßál6n dámx6n bˆ°a.} ""áti májbur
t-yàtli rèsqi.} ‘You are giving to it its sustenance and it is eating it. I
also shall go down and sleep at home. You will be obliged to give
me my sustenance.’ (A10:3)
(iii) A definite nominal that is a narrow focus
Agreement with a definite direct object is omitted on the verb if the object
constitutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may
be a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence, e.g.
(33) har-t-yàtli ða-bráta,} là?} mère hè.} mère yátli S6ttìye.} mère ma-yxàl6f,} t-yánnux S6ttìye.} ‘ “You will still give me a daughter, is that not so?’ ” He
said “Yes.” He said “You should give me S6ttiye (rather than one of
the others).” He said “Fine. I’ll give you S6ttiye.” ’ (A25:25)
(34) ""aláha hóle yíw6lli ""áyya ""ùrxa.} ‘God has given me this way.’ (A21:42)
Even when there is no direct object agreement suffix on the verb, the
indirect object can be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase.
This is found at the close of an intonation group to act as end-weighting, e.g.
(35) hátta m5xólta b-kàwe dár6x ""6lle-díye.} ‘We even give food to it through
the window.’ (A12:62)790chapter fifteenIt is also found where the speaker fronts the phrase to give the indirect
object prominence in order to set it in contrastive opposition to an indirect
object in an adjacent clause, e.g.
(36) ""6n-†lálux yáw6l xà xmára} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè xmáre.} ‘If he gives to
you one ass, he will give to your neighbour two asses.’ (A3:4)
(37) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘I have left nothing for you (whereas I
have taken everything for myself ).’ (A2:11)
At the end of a discourse unit the long alternative type of suffix construction for the expression of an indirect object is occasionally used on
compound verbal forms, whereby the copula element is placed after the
pronominal suffix. For the use of this construction with direct object suffixes for end-weighting see §15.13.5.:
(38) ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""è°ya kêsl6x.} ""6n-là mjuwèbla,} ""àtit °í°a kêsli.}
qrí°5la qála b-Šál6m ""u-Sùrma,} ‘u-jwába la-yìw6ll5la.} [< yiwa + 6lla
(3fs. indirect object) + ila (3pl. copula)] ‘ “If they answer you, then
indeed it is me who has come to you. If they do not answer you,
you have come to me.” She called Šalem and Surma, but they
did not give her any reply.’ (A26:4–5)
If a past base verb is used in the clause, an indirect pronominal object
tends to be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase in all circumstances, e.g.
(39) yíwla xa-q7sa xéna ""èlle dìye.} ‘She gave another stick to him.’
(A22:29)
(40) ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} ‘When God gave them a son . . .’
(A15:17)
(41) mêre ""èlle díye} ‘He said to him’ (A17:4)
(42) mère †làli} ‘He said to me’ (A22:8)
(43) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king replied to me thus.’ (A17:34)
(44) wídla f†árta ""êlli.} ‘She made breakfast for me.’ (A21:35)CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE SYNTAX OF PREPOSITIONS
The morphology and basic uses of the prepositions have been described
in §13.3. In this chapter we shall take a closer look at the syntax and
semantic range of the main prepositions, particularly those that have
multiple functions.
16.1. BThe preposition b- has a variety of uses. When it takes pronominal suffixes, these are attached to a longer base with the form biy-.
16.1.1. Spatial and Temporal Location
It may express location in a perceptible space in contexts such as the
following:
(1) šqíl5le q7sa b-""íðe dìye.} ‘He took the stick in his hand.’ (A22:30)
(2) ""o-yála zóra hóla mútt6lle be-pàlga.} ‘They put the small child in the
middle.’ (A4:58)
(3) w-ána b-ánna dašdàše-w} b-ánna ‘akàlle-w} ‘while I am in these plain
clothes and slippers’ (A6:7)
(4) šwíq6lla xáye bìy6x.} ‘He has left his life (which remained to him) in
you.’ (A4:42)
The preposition gu- is far more commonly used to express location within
an enclosed physical space, e.g. gu-xa-g6ppì°a} ‘in a cave’ (A15:1), gu-jˆbe}
‘in his pocket’ (A15:2), gu-Kàrkuk} ‘in Kirkuk’ (A16:1), gu-ða-mà°a} ‘in a
village’ (A48:1), gu-dudìya ‘in the cradle’ (A15:8). When the preposition
b- is used to refer to location in a physical space, this is generally less
physically enclosed, as in (1)–(4). It is more frequently used for location
in an abstract space, e.g. b-š7na b-†awà°a} ‘(You have come) in peace and
blessings’ (A15:8), b-xèlmi} ‘in my dream’ (A1:2), b-šóp6t bròn6n} ‘in the place
of our son’ (A4:39). The preposition b- expresses location within a state792chapter sixteenor activity in progressive constructions with infinitives, e.g. hóle b-°áya ‘He
is coming’ (A13:14), and occasionally other nouns.
It is used when a lesser degree of enclosure than in (1)–(4) is involved,
such that there is only surface contact, e.g. b-""ùrxa} ‘on the road’ (A15:1),
b-rèšux} ‘on your head’ (A23:8), b-miya šaxine ‘by warm waters’ (C2:54),
b-qðàli} ‘on my neck’ (A21:27).
In some cases it is used in an ingressive (5–8) or occasionally egressive
(9) sense:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)míya ßèlyela b-rešèy.} ‘The water came down onto their heads.’
(A16:11)
síqela b-xa-†ùra.} ‘They went up onto a mountain.’ (A17:4)
drí°a xêppo b-réša.} ‘She had put a veil on her head.’ (A19:2)
npílt5la b-xùbba.} ‘She has fallen in love.’ (A4:14)
mèšx6t qálya plí†le b-jebàne díye.} ‘The oil of the roast meat came out
of his pockets.’ (A23:9)The preposition gu- is likewise used in an ingressive or egressive sense,
e.g.
(10) wìrela gu-b7°a.} ‘They entered the house.’ (A15:7)
(11) zílela gu-ða-má°a xèta.} ‘They went into another village.’ (A15:10)
(12) síqela gu-xa-†ùra.} ‘They went up into a mountain.’ (A15:13)
(13) zèdy6lla gu-ða-dˆrta.} ‘They threw it into a house enclosure.’
(A15:12)
(14) šár†6n gu-""i°á°6 d-áwwa nàša.} ‘so that I escape from the hands of
this man.’ (A31:3)
(15) ""áti pál†6t gu-d-ànna.} ‘You should depart from these people.’
(A12:5)
Various nouns are used with b- in some contexts and with gu- in others,
as can be seen in the examples cited above. This should not necessarily
be interpreted as complete functional overlap, but rather is likely to reflect
different conceptualizations of the degree of enclosure involved, e.g.
b-xa-†ùra} ‘onto a mountain’ (A17:4)
gu-xa-†ùra} ‘into a mountain’ (A15:13)
gu-jˆbe} ‘in his pocket (hidden)’ (A15:2)
b-jebàne díye} ‘(from) in his pockets (revealed)’ (A23:9)the syntax of prepositions793b-""íðe dìye} ‘in his hand’ (A22:30)
gu-""i°á°6 ‘(from) in his hands (trapped)’ (A31:3).
The place through which one passes is also marked by b-, e.g.
(16) b-t8ra wìrt5la.} ‘It (the cat) entered by the door.’ (A23:19)
(17) táwre morètla b-kàwe.} ‘You should bring the oxen in through the
window.’ (A30:22)
The preposition b-, rather than gu-, is used to express location in a time
period, e.g. b-áyya dána ‘at this time’ (A15:7), b-lˆle ‘at night’ (A15:8), b-lˆle
b-yòma} ‘night and day’ (A21:2), b-""aßêrta} ‘in the evening’ (A22:31), b-q7†a
‘in the summer’ (B5:19), b-xarˆ°a} ‘at last’ (A22:5).
16.1.2. Instrument
It is often used in relation to the instrument or means by which an action
is performed. The complement is usually an inanimate object or a part
of the body, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)b-o n9ra} ""an-táwre dìye} mqudêqd5lel5y.} ‘He chopped the oxen up with
the axe.’ (A30:23)
xzáy6t6lla b-dùrbin.} ‘You see it with binoculars.’ (A25:52)
b6rzóma yá'ni ta-t-ßáli gu-gòma,} b-semàlta} ‘a hatch for them to go
down into the basement stable, by a ladder’ (A23:28)
zríy6nwale b-i°à°i.} ‘I had cultivated it with my hands.’ (A17:32)
""áyya kúlla q6m-max6rwàla} b-aqlá°a dìya.} ‘This (cat) has spoilt everything with its feet.’ (A23:19)Occasionally the complement is an animate referent, e.g.
(6)súq m7°i qˆsa biyéy.} ‘Go up and fetch wood with them (the asses).’
(A23:34)The expression waða b-xabra ‘to do by, according to the word (of so-andso)’ belongs here, e.g.
(7)""u-""èdyo ""áti lat-wáða b-xàbri.} ‘Today you are not doing as I say.’
(A21:43)794chapter sixteenUnder this head can be included phrases with the base b-gan- ‘by oneself ’,
e.g.
(8)ma-lat-ðáya b-gán6x qàr°5la?} ‘Don’t you know yourself that it is cold?’
(A20:1)
(9) wídla ""ixála ""áy b-gàna.} ‘She made the food by herself.’ (A21:40)
(10) y8ð6t b-gànux.} ‘You know by yourself.’ (A1:11)
Here also belong multiplicative expresses such as:
(11) ""áxni t-yawèxla xa-b-†¬à°a ""èlle díye.} ‘We shall give him threefold (if
it is lost).’ (A7:10)
16.1.3. ‘with’
On a number of occasions it is appropriate to translate the preposition
by English ‘with’. The relation may be comitative, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""á°i b-dáwla-w zórna-w tópe-w ‘Let them come with the drum and
pipe and with guns.’ (A4:33)
xáz6x ßèly5le b-xà †ena ""èxre} ""u-°éle b-†¬á°a †ène.} ‘We see that he went
down with one saddle bag of excrement and he has come back
with three saddle bags.’ (A7:12)
""ánna ma-t-íla xmíle b-©ðàðe!} ‘How happy they were with each other
(= together)!’ (A4:50)
""áyya bráta la-p7ša bìyux.} ‘This girl will not remain with you.’
(A29:33)
""i-xo†íla b-mêšxa.} ‘They mix them with oil.’ (B6:51)
""an-tre-maláxe t-w7wa ""è°ye bìya} ‘those two angels who had come with
her (= had brought her)’ (A4:44)It is also used to express various other types of association or linkage,
e.g.
(7)
(8)lìtl6n šúla bíye.} ‘We have no business with it (= It is not our business).’ (A48:6)
""aláha hole-mìra} t-yawêllux} b-šàr†} kú-mdit yawêllux} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l
trè.} ‘God has said that he will give to you with the condition that
everything he gives to you he will give to your neighbour twofold.’
(A3:4)the syntax of prepositions795(9)""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n,} wíra b-šênne.} ‘I am an old man, advanced in
age.’ (A8:43)
(10) mol6xmáli . . . ""áyya zmárta bíye dìye.} ’I composed this song about him.’
(C4:2)
(11) naša go‰a b-š6nne ‘a man big with regard to years (= an elderly
man)’16.1.4. Attributive
The preposition sometimes has the function of linking a referent to a
nominal that is presented as an attribute, in that it constitutes a component or property of it. e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)m6n-d-ànna} pazesór b-""6lyà°a,} hátxa b-qanàne} ‘Some of those big sheep
with fat tails and horns (big) like this’ (A7:22)
""ána làn b-xá-reša} b-šàwwa reš>wá°6n.} ‘I do not have just one head,
I have seven heads.’ (A24:41)
""ána b-zawnènne ""6n-háwe b-tèrte ""aqlà°a.} ‘I shall buy it if it has two
legs.’ (A22:9)
w-aßèrta m5°êtli} xá-qapla qˆse} t-lá-hawa b-qàlpe.} ‘In the evening bring
me a bundle of pieces of wood that are without bark.’ (A30:6)
wél6x hawnànta,} b-""iqár6t ßáw°a basìmta,} ""u-màqul.} ‘You have been
clever, with the honour of sweet and fine words.’ (A40:16)
b-ràxme!} ‘(May you be) with mercy! (= Bless you!)’ (A4:60)
†¬á-mma xatáne b-xa xerìya.} ‘Three hundred ladies with one veil.’
(D1:9)
barða b-qanane ‘hail with horns (= heavy hail)’We should classify here attributive expressions such as the following:
b-xamme ‘sad’, b-xaye ‘alive’, b-†ali ‘ill’, b-palxana ‘busy’ (§11.7.).
16.1.5. Material
It is occasionally used to denote the material out of which something is
made, e.g.
(1)t-oðètli gèšra b-qˆsa.} ‘Make me a bridge of wood.’ (A17:18)796chapter sixteen16.1.6. Price
It denotes the price at which an item is fixed either in an amount of
money or a bartered object, e.g.
(1) xá-kilo ""èxre b-†¬á°a dàw5le.} ‘One kilo of dung sells for three gold
pieces.’ (A7:14)
(2) ""ána zonènna b-""êßra.} ‘I shall buy it for ten (dinars).’ (B5:42)
(3) xál6t xètna q6m-zawènna ""ilána b-xamšì dináre.} ‘The maternal uncle of
the groom has bought it (the tree) for a hundred dinars.’ (B15:68)
(4) l-Yaws6p zwinta b-neriya. ‘It has been bought by Yaws6p for a male
goat.’ (B8:28)
Conversely it is used before the item sold in expressions such as (5):
(5) y-a°éwa zonàna,} y-amêrwa} ""àyya} ""àtxa b-yawènnux bíya díya.} ‘A purchaser
would come and say “I shall give you such-and-such (an amount
of money) for them (the apples).” ’ (B15:52)
16.1.7. Manner
It may express the manner in which an action is performed. In such cases
it is generally combined with an abstract nominal, e.g.
(1) maßl7l6n b-iqàra.} ‘They bring us down with honour.’ (A4:30)
(2) b8y6n lá-""a°i b-xàšša.} ‘I do not want them to come in sadness.’
(A4:33)
(3) ""áni b-x7la b8yi mbarxíla ""êlli.} ‘They want to marry her to me by
force.’ (A7:18)
(4) bás ""amrêtli} b-duzù°a} dàx ""áyya bráta wiðálux brát6t b7°a.} ‘Just tell me,
in truth, how have you made this girl a housewife.’ (A21:34)
16.1.8. Causal Background
Occasionally it expresses the cause or purpose of an action, e.g.
(1) ""ám6r b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Was it for this (reason) you sent for me?’
(A21:32)
(2) zílle b-ríx6t k>bàbe,} xzéle mdaxóye xmàre.} ‘He went after the smell of
kebabs, but he found the branding of asses.’ (D2:30)the syntax of prepositions797(3) l7w6t ""àti} ""5-bráta t-in-""ána wíð6lla gáni kóra b-rèš6x,} mèxy6lla ""urêdxa}
gu-""ˆni?} ‘Are you not the girl on account of whom I made myself
blind, by puttinng the needle into my eye?’ (A16:7)
16.1.9. Oath
The preposition is used in oaths or adjurations before the item by which
the speaker is swearing, e.g.
(1) mèra b-rèšux.} ""áti mútt6t-6lle tàma.} ‘She said “(I swear) by your head.
You put him there.” ’ (A22:39)
The preposition is most frequently used with this function before the
noun ""alaha ‘God’ in the phrase b-álaha, which is usually stressed on the
first syllable and often pronounced [b-a[la]. This expression is used in a
variety of contexts. In general it strengthens an assertion, by committing
the speaker fully to the truth of the statement, e.g.
(2) b-álaha ""áwwa xoš-yàl5le.} ‘By God, he is a good lad.’ (A21:5)
(3) b-álaha d°s-it.} ‘By God, you are right.’ (A17:19)
It is often used to introduce the response to a question, e.g.
(4) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” “By God, I’m
looking for my sustenance.” ’ (A20:1)
(5) há bròni,} m-ˆk6t °áya?} b-álaha m-bˆ°6n °áya,} ""àmti.} ‘‘ ‘Hey, my son,
where are you coming from?” “By God, I’m coming from home,
aunt.” ’ (A23:2)
(6) mèra mòdila qèßß6t díya?} mère b-álaha qèßß6t díya hàtx5la.} ‘She said “What
is her story?” He said “By God, her story is like this.” ’ (A4:14)
It is used to strengthen a remonstration expressed by a negative question,
e.g.
(7) b-álaha látwa mìrta} la-h7w6n ""u-lá b6‰-náša ""áw6r gu-""òt6x?} ‘By God, did
you not say that no animal and no person should enter the room?’
(A23:22)798chapter sixteen16.1.10. Complements of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition b- is used as the complement of some verbs, e.g. dbaša
b- ‘to stick to’, dqara b- ‘to touch’, mbaxole b- ‘to envy’, mhaymone b- ‘to
believe in’, mparoje b- ‘to look at’, tfaqa b- ‘to meet’, †paya b- ‘to catch
onto (fire)’, parpore b- ‘to plead to’, qya°a b- ‘to hit’, tpara b- ‘to threaten’,
xðaya b- ‘to rejoice in’, xkaka/gxaka b- ‘to laugh at’, xqara b- ‘to honour’,
xyara b- ‘to look at’. It is also used as the obligatory complement of some
attributive expressions, e.g. bista b- ‘familiar with’, bliga b- ‘busy with’, x6ðya
b- ‘pleased with’.
Several verbs may take a direct object complement or a complement
introduced by the preposition b-. In general the construction with the
prepositional complement is used to express a situation in which the action
affects the referent to a lesser extent than when a direct complement is
used, or a situation in which the action is less directly associated with the
referent. Some pairs are given below by way of illustration:
ðaya + object ‘to know, understand (sth., so. by direct knowledge)’, ðaya
b-‘to know about (sth. so. indirectly)’, e.g.
(1) y6ðènne ""á°‰6t bàbi.} ‘I know the land of my father.’ (A14:90)
(2) hé b-àlaha,} qídle b7°6t duglàna-w} ""áxni là-ðiye bíye.} ‘Oh, by God, the
house of the liar has burnt down, without us knowing about it.’
(A48:7)
mxaya + object ‘to strike’, mxaya b- ‘to play (a musical instrument)’, e.g.
(3) lá maxênn6x.} ‘I shall not strike you.’ (A51:19)
(4) ""Ašeba†àlo} ""áwwa máxe b-zòrna.} ‘Ašeba†alo played the pipe’ (A25:26)
mšaxlope + object ‘to change’, mšaxlope b- ‘to exchange’, e.g.
(5) ta-mšaxèlpi šèmm6t ’ùxo} ‘in order for them to change the name ’uxo’
(A7:3)
(6) mšuxlèpla b-is6qyà°a.} ‘They exchanged rings.’ (A4:5)
zmara + object ‘to sing (a song)’, zmara b- ‘to sing to (so.)’, e.g.
(7) ""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘They used to sing rawe.’ (B15:75)
(8) zmírre b-Zìne.} ‘He sang to Zine.’ (A25:22)the syntax of prepositions799xala + object ‘to eat (completely)’, xala b- ‘to eat (parts of sth.)’, e.g.
(9) xílela xa-ràmša.} ‘They ate dinner.’ (A16:9)
(10) ""u-rípel6lle kùlla,} nyása-w xàla ""èbbe-diye.} ‘They (the animals) all
attacked him, biting and eating bits of him (= gnawing him).’
(A35:21)
Some verbs can take a direct object or another preposition but use b- before
a referent that is disadvantaged in some way by the action, e.g.
(11) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why have you done this to me?’
(A15:14)
(12) xzi-málka bt-áw6ð bìyi.} ‘See, the king will do (something) to me.’
(A21:33)
(13) ""áp-""ana šqiláli š6ndùxta} d6ryáli bìya.} ‘I picked up a small stone and
threw it at it.’ (A23:22)
(14) ""áp-xa l5le-mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘Nobody could (do anything) against her
(= nobody could defeat her).’ (A25:68)
(15) šuréla ßráxa bíye dìye.} ‘She started shouting at him.’ (A25:82)
(16) bálki t-íle xa-mèndi °í°a bìya.} ‘Perhaps something has happened to
her.’ (A21:25)
The preposition with the sense of ‘disadvantage’ is found after the existential particle in expressions such as:
(17) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured. Nothing is the matter with
me.’ (A4:20)
With some verbs the preposition b- may be exchanged for other prepositions to express a different relationship to the complement. In (18), for
example, the verb xyara ‘to look’ takes a complement with b- (‘look at’),
but in the second clause the complement has gu- to express ‘looking into’
the enclosed interior of the cave:
(18) qamáye xírta b-áql6t súsa dìya,} la-xírra gu-gêppa.} ‘At first she looked at
the legs of her horse, she did not look into the cave.’ (A8:72)800chapter sixteen16.1.11. b6d-, budThe expression b6d- and its variant bud- is in origin a combination of the
preposition b- and the subordinating particle D. It is not, however, used
with exactly the same distribution as the basic preposition b-. It generally has the sense of ‘about, concerning’, which is not a meaning that is
generally expressed by b- alone, e.g.
(1)(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)""6n-xá-naša m7°elaxu xàbra} b6d-bròni,} kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a

""ánna šèmye-wawa b6d-M8mo m6n-Zìne.} ‘They had heard about M>mo

(A8:32)
qím6n molèxm6nna ""ánna šére bud-dìye.} ‘I composed these verses about
him.’ (C4:3)
b6d-""áwwa náša tàlx6x.} ‘Let’s destroy with regard to this man (= let’s
get rid of this man).’ (A30:41)Elsewhere the phrase is occasionally used to denote relations that are
expressed by the basic b- preposition, including causal (‘because of, on
account of ’), instrumental (‘through the means of ’) and comitative (‘with’),
e.g.
(8)bud-àyya mu°7lux ""ánna zúze.} ‘Because of this you have brought these
coins.’ (A1:27)
(9) rába ""ítley xayú°a basímta b6d-àyya,} yá'ni zrát6t xabùše.} ‘They had a
very good life on account of this, that is the cultivation of apples.’
(B5:106)
(10) y-axlíwa lèxma bêd-an q7se.} ‘They would eat bread through the means
of (the sale of ) this wood.’ (A14:10)
(11) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘This head of mine
will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
(12) qímla k°úla xa-k°àwa,} mšudèrra b6d-qàz6d.} ‘She wrote a letter and
sent it by a messenger.’ (A11:17)the syntax of prepositions801(13) l5šále bàxta,} b6d-míya mênne.} ‘A woman kneads it, together with
water.’ (B5:100)
In addition it is found in a few fixed expressions, e.g.
(14) qím5le híw6lla bná°e dìye} †la-d-an-nàše,} b6d-xá†6r d-ó-xona zòra.} ‘He gave
his daughters to those people on account of that young brother.’
(A12:22)
(15) har-dmíxt5la b6d-lèbba gu-b7°6t bába dìy5la.} ‘She continued sleeping,
thinking that she was in her father’s house.’ (A21:18)
16.1.12. Combined with Other Prepositions
The preposition b- is often combined with the locative preposition reš‘upon’, e.g.
(1)
(2)hóle dèrya jùlla b-réša.} ‘He put a cloth over them.’ (A25:48)
qím5le zíla mútta ""án-julla díya gu-d-o-sandùqa,} mútt6lla gu-""asàs6t b7°a,}
""u-bèny5le gùda b-réše.} ‘He put her clothes in a box and placed it in
the foundations of the house, then built a wall over it.’ (A14:99)
16.2. L-This preposition has a wide variety of functions. One reason for this is
that it is derived from two different prepositions in earlier Aramaic, namely
*l-‘to, for’ and *'al ‘upon’. Generally the usage of l- in the dialect makes it
clear from which of these two earlier prepositions it is derived in any one
particular case. In some cases, however, the derivation is not completely
certain. For this reason all the usages of l- are here treated together. It is
important, furthermore, to make a distinction between the adnominal uses
of l- and the adpronominal forms. Various possibilities exist for pronominalizing a phrase consisting of l + nominal. These include the L-suffixes
and independent phrases consisting of ""6ll- + pronominal suffixes. Each
of these pronominal forms has a restricted usage and is not found in all
contexts that l + nominal phrases are used.","[824, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836, 837, 838, 839, 840]"
"the syntax of nominals471(10) ""í°wa xa-málka gu-ða-mà°a.} ""o-màlka} ""í°wale têrte bná°a.} ‘There

(11) ßál6t xáz6t xa-képa l-márz6t yàma.} d7r6t ""íðux xo-d-ò-kepa.} ‘Go

(12) b-""úrxa tfíq5le xá-xuwwe bìye.} ""o-xúwwe mère} hà-naša} lˆk6t zála?}
‘On the road a snake met him. The snake said “Hey, man, where

(13) †axnìwala,} p7ši qàmxa.} ""o-qàmxa} m5°7wale bˆ°a.} ‘They would
grind it and it would become flour. They would bring the flour
home.’ (B5:15–16)
It is sometimes used with proper names when these have been mentioned
previously, e.g.
(14) ""o-Barzèkko zíla dmìxa.} ‘Barz6kko went and slept.’ (A12:10)
(15) ""aw-mtunéle ""aw-xèlma qa-d-ó Xáno Lapzèrin.} ‘He told the dream to
Xano the Golden Hand.’ (A10:9)
It may also be used to mark a nominal with a referent that has not been
explicitly mentioned earlier but is accessible from the preceding discourse
by virtue of its typical association with some element in the content of
this discourse (associative anaphora). Such uses of the demonstrative can
normally only be translated by the English definite article, e.g.
(16) ""ína m-bá°6r maqðàli} ""aw-qê†ma} šaqlìtule} mxamìtule.} ‘After she burns
me, take the ashes and keep them.’ (fire typically produces ashes)
(A26:85)
(17) qímta zílta k6s-d-aw-šwawèy.} ‘She went to their neighbour.’
(people located at home typically have a neighbour) (A10:9)

mqurêdxela.} ‘She (the servant) had left a tray there. A cat came in,
fell into the glasses and they shattered.’ (A4:53)
On numerous occasions the speaker deixis pronoun is used with the same
anaphoric function, viz. when the nominal has been explicitly mentioned
in the previous discourse (21–24), with previously mentioned proper
names (25), or when the referent of the nominal is accessible by associative anaphora (26):
(21) ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ""áwwa málka xzéle xa-xêlma.} ‘There was a

Since the referents in the examples cited above are all internal to the
discourse, the speaker does not use the speaker deixis demonstratives to
point to an item that is physically close to him. Rather they express a
virtual or psychological closeness to the speaker, the purpose of which is
often to give prominence to the referent in the staging and perspective
with which it is presented. The default demonstrative, on the other hand,the syntax of nominals473is neutral with regard to perspective and personal engagement. The choice
of the perspective with which the speaker wishes to present the referent
in a particular point in the discourse is a subjective one. Speaker deixis
demonstratives are often used to give prominence to the referents that play
a prominent role in the text, as is the case in examples (21)–(26).
In a similar way, anaphoric reference is expressed by independent
demonstrative pronouns, with the speaker in most cases chosing either the
default demonstrative or the speaker deixis form according to the perspective with which he wishes to present the referent. Default independent pronouns indicate that the referent is identifiable somewhere in the discourse
and are unspecified as to perspective or speaker engagement, e.g.
(27) ""aw- 6¬yále tópe díye spày.} ‘He loaded his gun well.’ (A31:7)
(28) ""ay-°éla dmíxla gu-""ót6x dìya.} ‘She came back and went to sleep in
her room.’ (A17:26)
(29) xár°a ""áni mè†yela tàma} l-márz6t yàma.} ‘Then they arrived there, by
the shore of the sea.’ (A14:37)
Speaker deixis independent pronouns are used to give prominence to a
referent in close perspective. They are often used to refer to protagonists
in a narrative and other textually prominent referents, e.g.
(30) ""áwwa plí†5le gu-ða-dúnye xèta,} š6mša milànta,} ""8ra milànta.} ‘He opened
it and he came out into another world, with a blue sun and a blue
land.’ (A14:26)
(31) ""áyya rìqt5la} ßlì°5la} hàw6rila!} ‘She ran and went down (crying)
“Beware!”’ (A24:42)
(32) ""ánna pìðela mènne díye,} ""ap-šlàma l7la dèry6lle.} ‘They passed by him,
but did not even greet him.’ (A15:13)
There may be a shift in the type of demonstrative that is used to refer to
one particular referent in different sections of the discourse, which reflects
changes in perspective. This is illustrated in (33), an extract from a narrative
that involves two protagonists, the Leli°a monster and the daughter-in-law
of the family. The narrative begins with the arrival of the Leli°a. In this
section she is the most salient and most active character and is presented
with close perspective by the speaker deixis demonstrative ""ayya [1]. In the
course of the narrative, however, the daughter-in-law becomes the most
salient character, who has the most control over the flow of events. This
is reflected by the use of the speaker deixis pronouns ""ayya [2] and [4],474chapter fourteenwhereas Leli°a is referred to by default demonstratives, viz. ""ay [3] and
[5], and the attributive demonstrative in ""5-Leli°a.

He had a daughter-in-law. He had sons. She (Leli°a) came down
and greeted them. . . . What did she (the daughter-in-law) do on
her return? She closed the door and in the middle of the house
she made a fire. . . . The Leli°a came. She was all (made of) fat,
fat, oil. . . . She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron
bars and putting them into her, until she killed her. She killed her,
and she (Leli°a) remained there.’ (A19:1–6)
A further example is the extract in (34), in which the protagonist Xano
is referred to by a speaker deixis demonstrative [2] and subsequently by
a default demonstrative [3]. This can be correlated with a difference in
discourse prominence. The section beginning with the speaker deixis
demonstrative [2] is a foregrounded section that advances the narrative.
The following section with the default form [3] supplies elaborative background information, which recapitulates an earlier, previously mentioned
event. It is worth noting that the clause with the default pronoun [1],
which refers to the king, also conveys repetitive background material,
since it comes immediately after a speech of the king in which he reports
his dream:
(34) ""aw-[1]mtunéle ""aw-xèlma qa-d-ó Xáno Lapzèrin.} ""áwwa [2] mère
b-àlaha} har-xá-m6ndi ""ì° b-áyya dúk°a t-íle wìra.} ""áw [3] xzèle ""o-dídwa
""7ka wìrre.} ‘He (the king) told the dream to Xano the Golden Hand.
He (Xano) said (to himself ) ‘By God, there must be something
in this place where it entered’. He (Xano) had seen where the fly
had entered.’ (A11:9)the syntax of nominals475Similarly in (35) the speaker deixis demonstrative [1] is in a clauses
that initiates a section describing a foreground event. The default dexis
demonstrative [2], which refers to the same character, can be interpreted
as elaborative information, which supplements the previously described
event rather than advancing the narrative:
(35) ""áwwa [1] b-l7le qìm5le.} gáw‰a díya mqulèbz6lle dèry6lle gawàya.} ""áw
[2] píša b-áy-gota xèt5le.} ‘He got up in the night. He rolled over her
husband and put him in the middle. He came to be on the other
side.’ (A30:53)
In constructions expressing a contrastive opposition between two items, the
two different demonstratives are used to separate distinctly the two items,
since they present them with different virtual spatial locations in the staging of the situation. In (37) and (38) the demonstratives express associative
anaphora. The ‘boys’ in (37) are typically associated with a school and the
table and its sides in (38) are associated with the act of sitting:
(36) ""5-dán6 t-ìla ‰íše,} kút-xa gu-šwí°6t gàne,} ""áyya gu-qáßr6t bába dìya,} ""áw
gu-‘ádre dìye} ‘When they woke up, each in their own bed, she in
the palace of her father and he in his tent . . .’ (A4:5)
(37) bróna díya gu-m6drása kút-yum y-awéwa mxáya l-aw-yàla,} šqála ‘ánta
d-àwwa,} šrà†a m6ndiyáne.} ‘Her son everyday in school would beat
one child, take the bag of another, tear things.’ (A14:5)
(38) holá-""6°ye tìwe,} báxta tíwta l-àyya-got6t m¶s,} ""u-gáw‰a tíwa l-ày-gota.}
‘They came and sat down, the wife sitting on this side of the table
and the husband sitting on the other side.’ (A4:57)
The virtual spatial separation is sometimes enhanced by using spatial
adverbs, e.g.
(39) díw6n t-xále díye hóla dwìqta.} ""áyya díw6n làxx5la} ""aw-gàrele.} ‘The
meeting room of his uncle is full. The meeting room is here and
that is its roof.’ (A23:14)
The speaker deixis demonstratives are sometimes used primarily to express
close emotional engagement with the referent with an evaluative sense,
which may be negative or positive. This is the case in (40)–(42), which
are extracts from direct speech. This speech is uttered by the speakers to476chapter fourteenthemselves in the absence of the referent of the nominal. The demonstratives, therefore, are not anaphoric nor are they used to point the attention
of a hearer to an item in the extra-linguistic situation:
(40) ""áyya xmàrta!} ‘That she-ass!’ (A10:10)
(41) mo-‘ára t-óð6x †la-d-áyya qá†u t-la ""axlàl5ni?} ‘What solution can we
find for this cat so that it does not eat us?’ (A44:1)
(42) b-álaha hóle híw6lle rèsqa d-áwwa gáw‰a ‘By God, he has provided the
sustenance of this husband (of mine).’ (A10:7)
Speaker deixis demonstratives are occasionally used with a nominal that
introduces a new referent into the discourse, when the speaker has a
particular personal interest in the referent. In (43), for example, a speaker
deixis demonstrative is used with the word ‘bridge’, which does not yet
exist in the extra-linguistic situation, nor has it been mentioned in the
preceding discourse. The speaker, however, proposes building such a
bridge. In (44) the speaker has a strong personal interest in the pot of
gold, which she introduces here for the first time in her speech to her
neighbour, although the object itself is not visible in the speech situation.
In English such demonstratives are most naturally translated by the indefinite article, though in some contexts a translation with a demonstrative
is also possible:
(43) xàli} lá ""awðèxle ""áwwa gêšra} šáwr6x réša réša d-ánna mìya?} ‘Uncle,
should we not make a bridge for it so that we can cross over this
water?’ (A17:3)
(44) xá-duk°a hon-xzí°a hátxa dàwe,} ""áyya qadált6 dàwe.} ‘In a certain
place I have found gold coins like this, a/this pot of gold coins.’
(A10:9)
A demonstrative may have an anaphoric function when the referent in
question is visible in the speech situation. In (45), for example, the function of the default demonstrative ""an- is to indicate that the arrows which
the speaker shows to the hearer are those that have been mentioned
previously in the discourse history. It does not point the hearer’s attention
to the referent. This is done by the presentative particle ho. In (46) the
speaker deixis subject pronoun ""anna points to the ring and scarf in the
speech situation, but the default demonstrative ""ani in the predicate has an
anaphoric function binding the reference to the preceding discourse:the syntax of nominals477(45) °éli hó ""an-†¬á ger6-qêšta.} ‘I’ve come back and here are the three arrows
of a bow (to which reference was made earlier).’ (A12:46)
(46) ""ína ""áyya ""isèq°a ""u-yalèxta d-ˆnila?} hóla ""isêq°a,} hóla yalêxta.} má†o mdaglènna gàni} t-ámr6n ""ánna l7la ""àni.} ‘But whose is this ring and scarf ?
Here is a ring and here is a scarf. How can I make myself lie and
say that these are not those (belonging to the girl I mentioned)?’
(A26:12)
The far deixis demonstrative is occasionally used to refer to items that
are internal to the discourse. The usual context for this is where two or
more members of a set are presented in a contrastive opposition. One
member is typically presented with either a speaker deixis or default
deixis demonstrative and the other and any further members are given
a far deixis demonstrative. The function of the far deixis demonstrative
is to separate the members of the set clearly in the virtual space of the
discourse, e.g.
(47) mattíwala gu-d-7 m6ššára xá, tré, †¬à°a.} man7wa hal-""êßra.} ""èßra gu-d-àyya,}
""èßra gu-d-yàha,} ""èßra gu-d-yáha xèta,} hàtxa.} ‘They would plant
them in the paddy field, one, two, three and count up to ten. Ten
in this (row), ten in that one, ten in that other one, and so forth.’
(B7:13)
(48) gu-m>˙àll-ži} kút-yum gánu k°7°a d-àwwa,} ""7-ga y-azèlwa féka d->wàha.}
‘Every day in the neighbourhood he would steal the chicken of
one person, then go (and steal) the fruit of another.’ (A14:7)
(49) brōn-málka tíw5le l-d-a-tàxta.} ""u-xá-w>zīr díye r6š-d-áwwa-kursa}
xa-r6š-d->wàha.} ‘The son of the king sat on the throne, one
minister (sat) on this chair and one on that one.’ (A14:43)
(50) zílla dwíqla náwba l->yà""ha qunjèlta t-hód6x,} ""áyya gu-d-5-qunjèlta xèta.}
‘They went and kept a guard in that far corner, and one in that
other corner.’ (A18:3)
Sometimes only one member of the set is explicitly mentioned, the other(s)
being implied, e.g.
(51) kút-xa †la-gáne šuréle dwàqa.} ßúdr6t S6ttìye} ""áwwa xálqa n‘ìlle,} Fárxo
q6m-xazéle ßàdra. Čixàlo,} m-ya-góta xèta,} q6m-xazéla ""ína xzéle ßádra
dìya,} krìble.} ‘Each of them started grasping the other. The button
of the blouse of S6ttiye was torn off and Farxo saw her breast.","[509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516]"
"18introduction(ii) The omission of initial /m/ in first /""/ verbs in stem II, e.g. ""5j6ble
‘He was amazed’ (A40:13 = C. Barwar m5j6ble).
(iii) The 3pl. L-suffix -lun or -lu rather than the normal C. Barwar form
-l5 / -la, e.g. plì†lun ‘They went out’ (B1:17), ""í°walu q6nyàne} ‘They
had cattle’ (B3:13).
Certain forms that are used by educated C. Barwar speakers are clearly
taken from the literary neo-Aramaic language known as swadaya. This
language, which is widely used in the Assyrian Christian communities, is
based on the C. Urmi dialect, but contains many elements from Classical
Syriac that do not occur in vernacular speech. One example of this is
the ending -ayi°, which is occasionally used by educated speakers to form
adverbials, e.g. prišáyi° ‘specifically’ (B1:10), šotapayì°} ‘socially’ (B15:72)
(§13.2.).
It has been shown above that the C. Barwar dialect is closely related
to the dialects of ˇiyare, but exhibits several points of difference. Distinctively ˇiyare forms are, however, found in some popular songs that were
sung in the Barwar communities, since they were originally composed in
ˇiyare, e.g. pawa (C2:23) ‘she wanted’ (= C. Barwar b>yawa), lali (C2:38)
‘to me’ (= C. Barwar †lali).
0.2.5. Influence from Other Languages
The Assyrian Christians of Barwar spoke in addition to their NENA dialect also Kurdish and Arabic. Kurdish was the language of the Muslim
population in the Barwar region. Arabic was spoken in the Iraqi towns
and was the language of school education.
The influence from the Iranian language Kurdish has been particularly
extensive. There are numerous features of the NENA dialect that exhibit
parallels with Kurdish and appear to be the result of borrowing and
convergence. The high degree of Kurdish influence on the lexicon of the
dialect is reflected by its large stock of Kurdish loanwords in all grammatical categories (nouns, verbs and particles). All the verbs and many
of the nouns have been adapted to Aramaic inflectional morphology (for
further details see §20.1.2.2.).
Also several features of phonological and grammatical structure appear
to have developed under the influence of Kurdish. In most cases these
are calques that imitate Kurdish but use NENA grammatical material.","[56, 57]"

"934chapter eighteen18.2.1. Negated Interrogative Clauses Expressing Preliminary Background Material
A negated clause that is pronounced with intonation patterns related to
those of questions (§18.5.3.) is sometimes used to signal that the situation
described in the clause should be taken as the grounds for what follows.
The construction is a device to draw attention to the clause, in order to
set it up as a boundary in the discourse, acting as the onset of a new
section. It is most commonly used to express temporal background. This
may express a situation that overlaps temporally with the following main
event (1–2) or a preceding event that marks its onset (3–6):
(1) ""ánna l7la dmìxe,} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta.} ‘While they
were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’ (A16:11)
(2) lá y-ßal•xwa ˙átta ""ùmra} x†ì°5wa ßál6xwa sarkóle.} ‘When we went down
to church, it was a sin to go bare-headed.’ (B10:44)
(3) lá m>y•xwa gùða,} pal†•xwala óìta.} ‘When we shook the churn, we
would take out the curds.’ (B10:9)
(4) la-°éle rèš-ßàwma,} b-šaql•xwa kúlla ""amàn6n,} kùlla b-šaql•xwala} d7r6xwa
q•†ma mxallêxwala.} ‘When the beginning of the (Lent) fast came, we
would take all our vessels, we would take them all and put ash on
them to clean them.’ (B16:7)
(5) l7le mútt6lla ""áqle dìye}—ßáwl6t màlka} ""iw7wa dàwa}—mútt6lla rš-d-àn b6zmáre,} ""o-b6zmára xíla m6n-dàwa,} šqíla m6n-dàwa.} ‘When he placed his
foot—the shoes of the king were made of gold—he placed them on
the nails, the nail ate the gold, took some of the gold.’ (A14:28)
(6) ""áyya másta la-q6m-daríla gu-d-aw-gùða,} . . . heš-t-là bráza,} xán‘i t-la-bráza
m5°íwa xa-g•lla y-amríle sêrmo.} ‘When they have put the yoghurt in the
churn . . . while it is not yet dry, shortly before it becomes dry, they
would fetch a herb called s6rmo.’ (B14:1)
Occasionally the construction is used to express the causal grounds for
the situation described in what follows, e.g.
(7) dúk°6 d-ó-g6ld6t tàwra,} l5le-wíða g•dda zòra,} xzi-k6má m>sà˙a dwíqle.}
‘Since he had made it into a fine thread, the place (enclosed by) the
ox skin covered a great area.’ (A11:13)
On sporadic occasions the negative construction expresses the background
of a preceding rather than following clause, e.g.","[972, 973]"
