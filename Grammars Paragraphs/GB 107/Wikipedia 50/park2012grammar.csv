The negative counterpart of the affirmative interjection éè yes, which cannot be usedpredicatively, is neehá no. Neehá is actually a stative verb that means ‘to not be something’.
When used as a response, the word may occur as both an interjection (neehá no) and a verb
(neehác it is not so).
The negative existential verb neesá to not exist can also be used as a response word. In
this function it can also occur both as an interjection (neesá no) and a verb (neesác there is no
such thing). The positive existential counterpart of neesá is madú to exist. It can only be used as
a verb (madúc there is such a thing) and never as an interjection (*madú yes).
Although the inventory of examples presented in this chapter comprises the most
common Hidatsa interjections, it is far from exhaustive. In addition to everyday interjections,
there are numerous interjections whose use is restricted to ceremonial occasions and have, with a
457few exceptions, completely disappeared from usage. For example, each of the four coups
counted on an enemy seems to have been accompanied by specific vocalizations, as indicated by
a single example, aache ‘cry uttered by the first and second coup strikers’, in Jones’s lexical slip
files. In his field notes, Gilbert Wilson, too, refers to various vocalizations that were uttered by
specific groups of people on specific occasions. One of the few examples that he actually
recorded is hiráá éèeee!, which, according to his informants, was “a word that boys of our tribe
used to cry out in old times when meat was brought home from the hunt.”","[480, 481]"

properties of the reciprocal prefix fall outside the scope of the present description, some basic
observations will be briefly described.
The stem has to be inflected for the plural when the agents and objects of the reciprocal
stem are co-indexical. The reciprocal stems need to be inflected in the plural also when the
reciprocal prefix occurs in the direct object role and plural agents are referred to. In the
imperative forms in (219), the plural imperative speech-act marker -ara is used in affirmative
commands and -ara plus the negative suffix -dhaa in negative commands since the command is
given to more than one person. The verb stem is not in the plural in (220) because the reciprocal
prefix is not coindexed with the agent; rather, it represents relations between elements of the set
represented by the object.

4.11.3 -hcági ‘limitive’
The limitive suffix -hcági derives denominal stative verbs. The basic meaning of -hcági can be
glossed as ‘only’ or ‘nothing but’. In this sense it is also used as an adverbial suffix that can
modify words belonging to any lexical class (quantifiers are described in 13.5). The derivation of
limitive verbs is illustrated in TABLE 4.61.

4.11.4 -hgee ‘diminutive’
The diminutive -hgee looks identical to the indirect causative suffix. Some speakers of the
Independence dialect use -hgee as a modal suffix with both nouns and verbs to soften their tone
of speech. The diminutive suffix, however, is not common in verb derivation. Lexicalized
diminutive verbs are inflected with B-set prefixes. Examples of diminutive verb derivation are
given in (262) and an example of usage in (263).

4.11.5 -hisa ‘simulative’
The simulative suffix -hisa is extremely productive in verb derivation and refers to a quality or

possession, as in (272). It is likely that the negative existential verb is also used to form negative
perfective constructions as in Crow (c.f., Graczyk 2007:154); however, there are no tokens in my

"6.1.3 Commands
Commands are used to elicit action from one or more addressees either by directing them or
suggesting that they engage in an activity. Prohibitive, or negative, commands direct the
addressee to refrain from an activity. In Hidatsa, there are two types of commands. The more
common one is a prototypical imperative that has no other attitudinal connotations. The other
one, the precative, softens the tone of the command and makes it appear more like a polite
request or an entreaty rather than an order. Imperative and precative forms of active stems are
inflected for number but not for person. Commands formed from middle and reflexive verbs are
inflected for second person and number.",[266]

Prohibitive commands with middle, reflexive, and instrumental verbs are also formed byadding the imperative suffix to the negative suffix -dhaa, and the verb is inflected for second
person, as in (93)–(95).",[271]
"6.1 Speech-act modality
According to the speech act theory first put forward by Austin (1962) and later developed further
by Searle (1969), the speech acts that we produce proceed from the context of the situation in
which they are produced and are therefore pragmatic acts, rather than mere linguistic acts.
Hidatsa is one of those languages that has grammaticalized the implied, or intended meaning, of
every speech act in addition to its literal meaning. Thus, the propositional content of every
utterance (or locutionary act) is always combined with an indicator of the illocutionary force of
that utterance. The illocutionary force of every well-formed Hidatsa utterance (in the simplest
case an independent clause) is indicated by an obligatory matrix clause-final marker.
The main purpose of speech-act markers in Hidatsa is to add illocutionary force to the
locutionary, or literal meaning, of an utterance. The speech-act markers do not alter the
223propositional content of utterances, they merely permit us to draw inferences about the speaker’s
intentions, assumptions, and attitudes. Thus, a simple statement like “he speaks Hidatsa” can be
uttered assertively, emphatically, as an exclamation, or a simple neutral statement without any
attitudinal overtones.
Speech-act markers in Hidatsa can be divided into three categories of unequal size:
statements, commands, and questions. Each category contains a number of grammaticalized
speech acts identified by traditional grammatical labels, such as interrogative, declarative, and
imperative. The feature differentiating minor speech-act types from each other in each of the
three categories is the force of assertion. The statements category comprises the largest number
of grammaticalized speech acts, questions have three, and commands two. As Givón (1984: 318)
has pointed out, the “major well-coded speech-acts [i.e., statements, questions, and commands]
are just the most common, conventionalized (‘grammaticalized’) prototypes”. In reality, the
prototypes are distributed along a continuum space organized along a number of socialpsychological dimensions (Givón 1984: 318).
The three major types of speech acts and their realizations in Hidatsa are listed in TABLE
6.2.

as a separate speech-act type, in this grammar they are treated separately in section 14.4.
The domain of most illocutionary markers in Hidatsa is a sentence that may be a single
independent clause, or may include relative, adverbial subordinate, or coordinated clauses.
Speech-act suffixes and evidential enclitics (see 6.2) are not necessarily sentence final since
other constituents of the sentence may follow the verb and the illocutionary suffix. Examples (1)
and (2) illustrate variation in word order.

"Arguments are focused for emphasis. Since the argument structure is encoded by
pronominal affixes in the verb stem, the use of overt pronouns is usually redundant. They are
often used in commands and directives, as in ‘you drive today’, or for suggestions, as in ‘I will
be the driver today’, especially if the person thus singled out is an unexpected candidate for the
task.
Focused arguments are different from contrastive arguments which are formed with ihgii
(see 11.2.3). As the label implies, such arguments are contrasted with each other, as in ‘I will
drive; he will cook, but she will sew’. 92
The focus particle -wa is homophonous with but distinct from the indefinite article -wa.
In addition to the simple fact that the focusing -wa can follow a demonstrative or a personal
pronoun the main argument in support of distinguishing the two morphemes comes from
92The function of focus and contrast markers in Hidatsa if very similar to the use of subject particles -i/-ga andcontrastive particles -eun/-neun in Korean. Although Korean verbs do not mark subject agreement, the use of
pronouns marked with -i/-ga is largely restricted to emphatic constructions. As in Hidatsa, pronouns marked
contrastively are used to mark contrast or the sentence topic.",[392]
"36into the reasoning behind incorrect transcription of accent: it has been marked on the first
syllable, as the Hidatsa high front vowel i is perceptually more salient than the low vowel a, or
on the long second vowel, as long vowels are again perceptually more salient than short vowels.
Another source of confusion has been high-pitch homophones. For example, the word
mirí can mean either ‘water’ or ‘celestial luminary’. In many published sources, one of these
meanings is transcribed as mirí and the other one as *míri.
Hidatsa speakers are generally oblivious to the existence of pitch in their language. This,
compounded by the problem of vowel length, has been one of the major reasons why
community-based initiatives for developing an orthography have not been successful. Fluent
speakers are aware that words distinguished only by pitch (and/or length) sound different but
typically are unable to analytically articulate the difference. Massively incorrect accent marking
in published word lists and traditional stories that are used in the community has further added to
the conundrum.
The fact that Hidatsa is not a stress-accent language does not mean that certain elements
in a pitch phrase cannot be stressed if needed. During the early stages of my field work this
turned out be a major source of incorrect accent marking in my own field notes, all corrected
now, when the speakers working with me wanted to correct mistakes in my pronunciation by
stressing an otherwise unaccented syllable. 3
Incorrect accent placement and mistakes with pitch contour often change the meaning of
words in subtle and not-so-subtle ways that are a source of amusement for fluent speakers and an3In polysyllabic “super compounds” consisting of multiple stems, the underlying accent in the individualcomponent lexemes is sometimes realized as secondary stress.","[59, 60]"

The morphophonemic status of nuwa remains somewhat unclear. It forms a phonologicalword with the following verb when it is used as a downtoner or a pronoun. It forms a
phonological word with the preceding noun when it is used as a quantifier, unless the following
verb begins with m, in which case the allomorph nuu of nuwa again forms a phonological word
with the verb. The affix-like properties of nuwa are confirmed by the fact that although it usually
precedes the GI-morpheme and pronominal affixes in the prefix template, as in (65a), it may also
follow them, as in (65b).

483Examples (58)–(62) demonstrated that, unlike prototypical affixes, nuwa can also serve
as a base for deriving independent adverbs and pronouns. However, at least one derived pronoun,
‘someone’ or ‘something’ in (66), which is derived without suffixation, is also subject to
allomorphy before m-initial stems as if it were a prefix. (Note that the definite
‘someone/something’ and indefinite ‘anyone/anything’ are not distinguished in Hidatsa;
maaruwa/maaruu can denote either one.)
(66)maaruwa / maaruusomeone, anyone; something, anythingIn addition to independent adverbs and pronouns, nuwa serves as a base for deriving a
few verbs, such as maaruwádhaa to be nothing, be OK and nuwahgarú something to be wrong
with something. Note that the second syllable of nuwá in maaruwádhaa is now clearly accented
as the following negative morpheme -dhaa is pronounced with low pitch. Examples are (67)–
(69).","[506, 507]"
"2966.6.5 -aci/-raci ‘compromisive’
The compromisive suffix -aci/-raci is a suffixal hedge that calls into question the appropriateness
of the verb concerned. It can be added to any predicate and is usually glossed as ‘kind of, sort of,
rather’. The compromisive suffix has two allomorphs: the ablaut-triggering suffix -aci after short
vowels and its non-ablaut causing allomorph -raci after long vowels (including diphthongs). The
contrast between the allomorphs is illustrated in (290a-b) with the two free variants of the verb
bxígi~bxigee to be squat as a person, be short and stubby:
(290) a. Bxígaacidoore. She is kind of short and squat. < bxígi + aci + doore ASSERT
b. Bxígeeracidoore. She is kind of short and stubby. < bxígee + raci + doore ASSERT
The excessive use of this downtoning suffix, which some speakers find distasteful, is
particularly associated with the Independence dialect, but it is extremely common in other
dialects as well.
Although compromisive expressions reach out towards the meaning encoded in the
predicate, at the same time they reduce the force of it. The speaker does not deny the information
conveyed by the predicate, but seems to do it in a deprecating and grudging way. Compromisive
and neutral statements are contrasted in (291) and (292).

Indrek ParkiiiACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The seed for this grammar was planted in the winter of 2006 after I had returned to
Bloomington from an unsuccessful trip to many different reservations in the Plains to locate a
language for my dissertation research. Just as I was giving up hope, Raymond J. DeMallie
suggested to Douglas R. Parks that I work on Hidatsa. A few months later, I was able to
accompany Doug on an unrelated trip to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, where he had
worked for more than thirty-five years documenting the Arikara language. Since Doug has a
larger-than-life reputation on Fort Berthold, I could not have found anyone more qualified to
introduce me to the community. Besides Doug’s reputation, the serendipitous similarity between
our last names, and the fact that we are both at Indiana University has opened many doors for me
on Fort Berthold and probably left behind a number of confused individuals.
The most important person to whom Doug introduced me was Rosaria Starr, one of the
most fluent Hidatsa speakers on the reservation. Rosie had worked on language projects in the
past both with Doug and a fellow Siouanist, A. Wesley Jones, and she graciously agreed to
collaborate with me on the Hidatsa documentation project, one of the byproducts of which is the
present grammar of Hidatsa.
On the same trip Doug introduced me to another very special person for Hidatsa studies,
A. Wesley Jones, who gave generous support for my documentation project, including an
unexpected jump start. Wes had worked on Hidatsa in the 1970s and 80s. Trusting Doug’s
recommendation, he not only agreed to grant me access to all of his field materials but also to
deposit them in the archives of the American Indian Studies Research Institute at Indiana
University. During my numerous trips through Bismarck to or from Fort Berthold, Wes and his
wife Jenny have always been wonderful hosts and great company.
ivThanks to the A. Wesley Jones collection I was able to connect in unexpected ways to
several other linguists who have worked on Hidatsa in past. In 1988, Florence Voegelin entrusted
Wes with the bulk of her own field materials as well as those of her late husband Carl Voegelin
and his colleague Zellig Harris. Wes collated most of their lexical files with his own. I am
gratified to know that this important and rich collection, which was originally compiled in
Bloomington and then Bismarck, after a twenty-year sojourn in North Dakota has found its way
back to Indiana. I am proud that my own field materials, both the field notes and sound
recordings, have become a part of this historical collection, which has continually grown in size
and quality after it was first begun at Indiana University more than sixty years ago.
I could not have completed this dissertation without the advice from my committee,
chaired by Douglas Parks and Robert Botne, and including Ray DeMallie, Paul Kroeber, and
Stuart Davis, whose comments on the draft versions of individual chapters contributed
generously to the development of my ideas. As a non-native speaker of English, I often found it
more difficult to deal with my English prose than with the Hidatsa data, which I stand by without
reservation as it was recorded verbatim from the best speakers of the language.
Douglas Parks and Robert Botne in particular went to great lengths to help me improve
the readability of the English sections of the dissertation. Doug and I work in the same building,
and consequently he was usually the first person I went to with questions. Much of my
understanding of language typology, morphology, and related phenomena comes from Robert
Botne, from whom I took four courses, all of which I consider among the most insightful,
interesting, and instructive during my years of study in the Linguistics Department.
Whenever I received back a draft chapter from Paul Kroeber, it was always followed up
by a lengthy discussion in which Paul, drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of languagevtypology and his familiarity with the Crow language, led me time and again to alternative paths
of analysis. Paul’s ability to detect inconsistencies and contradictions, even if they were
hundreds of pages apart, never ceased to amaze me.
Thanks to my minor advisor, Ray DeMallie, I was always mindful of the fact that
language is a social institution first and a formal system second; I hope that this insight from
anthropology is reflected in the final version of this grammar, exemplified particularly in the
section on kinship, where I discuss some parallels between social and grammatical structures.
A special note of appreciation goes to Stuart Davis, who was not only my pre-dissertation
advisor in the linguistics department but also played a decisive role in bringing me to IU. Stuart
was often the first person to comment on my preliminary ideas, even before they became
chapters, by giving me valuable feedback on my annual presentations at the Linguistic Society of
America meetings.
My greatest thanks go to the Hidatsa people who welcomed me into their homes and
communities, and who honored me and my wife by formally adopting us into the Knife clan.
First and foremost, this grammar would not have been possible without the fulltime commitment
by my most important collaborators, Rosaria Starr and Arvella White, who spent countless hours
patiently answering my questions, expanding paradigms, and translating texts. This work is as
much theirs as it is mine. I would also like to thank all the other Hidatsa speakers who
participated in this project, especially, Fred Gunn, Carol-Ann Newman, Bryan Brady, and
Louann Phelan, and countless others who willingly shared their time and knowledge with me.
Work on the present grammar was conducted under the aegis of the Three Affiliated
Tribes Tribal Council in the hope of contributing to the preservation of the Hidatsa language. I
would like to express my particular gratitude to Bernadine Young Bird, Susan Paulson, ConnieviWhite Bear, Mark Bluestone, Quincee Baker, and Malcolm Wolf, all of whom provided me with
institutional support.
The successful completion of this project was made possible by support from the Hans
Rausing Endangered Languages Project in London, the American Philosophical Society, the
New Town School District, and the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.
Finally, I thank you, Sayon, my beloved wife, friend, and partner in all my quests. Your
encouragement, support, quiet patience, and unwavering love over the past five years were
undeniably the bedrock upon which this dissertation has been built.viiINDREK PARK
A GRAMMAR OF HIDATSAThis dissertation is a comprehensive description of the grammar of Hidatsa, a Siouan language
spoken by approximately 100 people on the Forth Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota.
The grammar begins with a description of the historical and linguistic background of
Hidatsa and an overview of previous scholarship. It then proceeds to a description of Hidatsa
phonology, derivational and inflectional morphology, lexical categories, and concludes with a
chapter on clausal phenomena.
The phonemic inventory comprises ten consonants, five vowels, and two diphthongs.
Vowel length is contrastive. There is no lexical stress; instead, Hidatsa has developed a pitchaccent system that involves contrast between high and low pitch, contrast between level and
falling pitch contours on long vowels and diphthongs, underlying accent on most morphemes,
and variation on the surface level of accent placement caused by various derivational and
inflectional patterns.
The canonical sentence structure is agent-object-verb, also characterized by postpositions,
head marking, and internally-headed relative clauses.
Hidatsa employs two systems of morpho-syntactic alignment that distinguish between the
arguments of transitive and intransitive verbs. The two core arguments of transitive verbs, agent
and object, and the single core argument of intransitive verbs, subject, are marked by (1)
pronominal prefixes on verbs (split-intransitive alignment) and (2) suffixes on noun phrases
(ergative alignment). Overtly expressed clausal arguments are also disambiguated by their
relative ranking on the animacy and agentivity scales.
viiiHidatsa morphology is agglutinative and involves considerable prefixation and
suffixation. Participant information and modal categories are encoded on the verb by affixation.
Hidatsa has developed a typologically unusual evidential system and an elaborate system of
obligatory speech-act suffixes. Both deverbal nominalization and compounding are highly
productive. There is also limited noun incorporation. Other Siouan characteristics include
classification by posture verbs, perspective by motion verbs, and alienable and inalienable
possession.
The grammar is written within the framework of Basic Linguistic Theory. Data used were
obtained through elicitation from Hidatsa speakers and analysis of spontaneous speech. This
study disproves several widely held notions about Hidatsa, clarifies various outstanding issues,
and identifies various hitherto unknown features in the language.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
"2196 Modality, aspect, and tense
This chapter describes the closely related categories of modality, aspect, and tense. The most
important of the three is modality, which is subdivided into several subcategories. Every Hidatsa
utterance, with the exception of interjections, is obligatorily marked for one or several modal
categories, which include speech-act modality (always required), evidential modality (required in
most constructions when the information is second-hand or inferred, and inherent in progressive
constructions), deontic (permissions) and dynamic (ability) modality, and epistemic modality
(judgments, expressed with tense affixes). The types of modality found in Hidatsa are presented
in TABLE 6.1. (adapted for Hidatsa from Nordström 2010: 16).
TABLE 6.1. PRINCIPAL TYPES OF MODALITY IN HIDATSA
Event modalityPropositional modalitySpeech-act modality- deontic modality
- dynamic modality- evidential modality
- epistemic modality- declaratives
- interrogatives
- imperativesThere are two morphological aspects: the habitual and the usitative; and two, the
progressive and the continuative, which are expressed periphrastically with auxiliary posture
verbs.
Hidatsa is a future–nonfuture language, i.e., it overtly marks future events but does not
distinguish morphologically between the present and past tenses. There are two future tenses that
are used not only to describe unrealized events, but also volition, epistemic judgments, and
hypothetical (irrealis) events.
The history of description of the Hidatsa modal system presents a cautionary tale of
linguistic theories based on incomplete analyses. There are at least 17 speech-act markers and 4
evidential markers in Hidatsa that fall into two natural classes, illocutionary suffixes and
220evidential enclitics. 50 Until recently, the two modal classes were not distinguished from each
other, and all descriptions of the Hidatsa modal system contained numerous omissions and
incorrect forms. Nevertheless, the grossly misunderstood, inadequately described, and
misanalyzed Hidatsa data have found their way into popular linguistics textbooks as well as
having been used as cornerstone data in several theoretical papers.
In 1955, Florence Robinett published her master’s thesis on Hidatsa morphophonemics in
the International Journal of American Linguistics (Robinett 1955a), in which she identified two
evidential enclitics and eight speech-act markers. In 1965, G. H. Matthews published Hidatsa
Syntax, a generative description in which he identified six “moods” in Hidatsa (identified by four
speech-act and two evidential markers), all apparently borrowed from but not credited to
Robinett (G. H. Matthews 1965: 99). Elsewhere (G. H. Matthews 1965: 107) he also identifies
two command markers, seemingly also borrowed from Robinett, but does not include them with
his other moods. Amazingly, Matthews’s analysis has remained the “received” view of the
Hidatsa system that has been cited in numerous books and articles for almost forty years with
little or no credit given to Robinett. Some, such as Palmer in his texbook on Mood and Modality
(2001: 37), simply found the Hidatsa system “interesting” while admitting that “there are serious
problems about the interpretation”, whereas others, such as Zwicky (1985b) and (1985a), made
extensive theoretical assumptions based on the faulty data in Matthews’s Hidatsa Syntax. 5150Although I believe that this grammar contains an exhaustive inventory of Hidatsa modal particles, the discoveryof a few more cannot be ruled out.
51Matthews’s list contains the following “moods”: 1. wareac quotative (waréè EVIDENTIAL), 2. rahe report (rahéèREPORTATIVE), 3. oak indefinite (-dóòg SPECULATIVE), 4. -c period (-c DECLARATIVE), 5. -ski emphatic (-sgíí EMPHATIC),6. -ˀ question (-ˀ INTERROGATIVE), 7. -(a)h optative (Ø IMPERATIVE), and 8. -(a)ka imperative (-ga PRECATIVE).
Matthews’s description of the modal particles he identifies is in most cases incorrect. For example, his wareac221Jones (1984) lists three of the four evidential enclitics and most of the illocutionary
speech-act suffixes. Even more (but not all) illocutionary suffixes occur in his unanalyzed field
transcriptions of elicited vocabulary.
Boyle (2007) attempts to systematize the data pertaining to modality in Hidatsa, but,
unfortunately, introduces more erroneous forms. He recognizes three of the four evidential
enclitics but splits one of them, the opinionative rahéè, into singular rahee and plural rahaa, not
realizing that the vowel change in the plural form is caused by ablaut before the plural suffix -ˀa.
He correctly identifies nine speech-act markers, but also introduces two non-existent ones (Boyle
2007: 197). 52quotative is actually a combination of two particles, an evidential enclitic waréè, which combines with most
illocutionary speech-act markers, and an illocutionary marker -c, which combines with all other evidential markers.
Occasionally Matthews’s examples contain other speech-act markers that he does not include among his
inventory of Hidatsa “moods”. He recognizes, for instance, the “remote past” marker stao (-sdaaˀ DEFINITIVE), but
not as a “mood” marker. Matthews claims that “none of my examples came directly from Lowie, R. H., Hidatsa
Texts: but wherever possible I have chosen examples that are similar to or identical with sentences that occur in
Lowie’s book” (Matthews 1965: 99). In reality it seems that he has “created” much of his Hidatsa data by drawing
on the vocabulary and expressions in Lowie’s texts and then freely combining them in order to make the data match
with the theories. For example, no Hidatsa speaker would ever produce a sentence like wíra ápáari ki stao wareac
the tree began to grow (Matthews 1965: 115). To make this sentence grammatical, hgi- begin would have to be
prefixed to abáàri to grow, and the illocutionary suffix -sdaaˀ, which occupies the same slot with the declarative
suffix -c in the morpheme template, would have to replace the latter following the evidential enclitic waréè, as in
Mirá giˀabáàri wareec / wareesdaaˀ. The tree began to grow.
52Boyle identifies hahka as a permissive speech-act marker. It is, in fact, an enclitic that is used with deontic anddynamic modalities that has to be followed by any of the illocutionary, or speech-act, suffixes.
The past emphatic speech-act marker -aha that Boyle identifies is actually an emphatic speech-act marker he that can be used either in future, present, or past statements. Apparently Boyle incorrectly heard the final vowel
in the example he gives, míàs iigiracóòbaˀahe (in fast speech iigiracóòbaˀhe) they kissed the woman, as a, and
misconstrued the echo vowel of the plural suffix -ˀa as part of the emphatic suffix.","[242, 243, 244, 245]"
"1.5 Sources of data
Since the reliable corpus of Hidatsa language materials is not large, the description in this
grammar is primarily based on my own fieldwork data.
Between 2006 and 2010, I spent a total of about two years on the Fort Berthold
Reservation documenting the language. I used primarily two methods for documentation –
elicitation and group sessions. During five-hour daily elicitation sessions I worked primarily with
my two principal collaborators, Rosaria Starr and Arvella White, both of whom are members of
the conservative Xosga band and excellent speakers. Working with two people simultaneously
gave the speakers an opportunity to consult with each other and, when needed, to correct one
other. Occasionally, other speakers who were experts on specialized terminologies, joined us for
more topic-oriented elicitation sessions. The first and longest stage of elicitation sessions
consisted of re-eliciting Jones’s and Voegelin’s slip files to establish correct pronunciation,
15expand paradigms, and eliminate questionable forms. 2 Paradigms and other data sets were
systematically expanded by applying possible derivational and inflectional processes to them.
The second stage of lexical elicitation consisted of the same process applied to other extant
vocabularies (Bowers 1981, Hall 1876-90 and 1882, Maximilian 2008-12, lexical data in
Wilson’s field notes from 1905 to 1918, and other, minor vocabulary lists).
The group sessions consisted of four- to five-hour topic-oriented meetings of three to five
speakers. In a typical session, the participants used the Hidatsa language to discuss a predetermined set of topics on Hidatsa culture and history. All group sessions were tape recorded.
Since the transcription of such sound recordings is an extremely time-consuming process, I was
able to transcribe and utilize only a fraction of them for this dissertation. However, even by
passively participating in the group sessions I was able to greatly enhance my understanding of
spoken Hidatsa and some of its structural and stylistic peculiarities.
My field work materials are organized into three interconnected modules. The first is the
data gathered from lexical elicitation sessions and is structured into an alphabetically organized
lexical database that at present contains approximately 10,000 main and sub-entries. As a rule,
all derived stems along with their inflected paradigmatic forms and examples of usage are listed
under their respective bases in the database. Each derived form exists also as a separate minor
entry in the database, with a cross reference to the main (sub)entry for a detailed description.
Examples of usage, such as sentences and phrases, are listed separately under each lexeme used
in the example, except the most common words, such as demonstratives and auxiliaries.","[38, 39]"

The three assertive speech-act markers -dóòre, -dóòres, and -dóòreewa are used for asserting a
fact rather than making a simple declarative statement. The basic form is -dóòre, and the other
two are synchronically analyzable as combinations of the assertive -dóòre plus the exclamative wa and possibly the definite -s. The short e in -dóòres may indicate that what is synchronically
perceived as the definite suffix -s may have its origin in a diachronic cluster that has caused the
final vowel before it to shorten.6.1.1.8.1 -dóòre ‘assertive’
The assertive suffix -dóòre is used when the speaker wants to assert a fact instead of simply
stating it, as illustrated in (45)–(50).

*Dúàhga when is a bound root that occurs only with clause-final and adverbial suffixes.
Like other Siouan languages, Hidatsa has distinct forms of ‘when’ that distinguish
between realized (or realis) past events and unrealized (or irrealis) future and hypothetical events.
Questions about the future and unrealized or hypothetical events are formed by
combining *dúàhga when with the irrealis conditional suffix -rúg (see 17.4.1.2), as in (69)–(71).
The main verb has to be marked with the irrealis prefix aru- / oo- (see 6.5.3) or one of the future
tense suffixes (see 6.5.2). The same irrealis prefixes or future suffixes are used in the answer. If
the answer is a verbless sentence, it is marked for irrealis by other means, such as with the
abilitative suffix -hahgá in (70) or the conditional suffix -rúg in (71).",[460]

Dóòhseewa why, how come is an interrogative pro-adverb. It is derived by adding the focus

wh-questions where the focus element of question is the reason, as in the questions in (67) and

Hidatsa is a Siouan language spoken today by about 100 people of varying fluency living on the
Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in west-central North Dakota. There is, in addition, an
indeterminate number of passive speakers who understand Hidatsa but are unable to speak it.","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"Hypercorrect form: [maaníraguaʔ]In fast, connected speech, the allophonic variants [w] and [r] prevail even in word-initial
position, as illustrated in (18).

Do you want to go out?
The database upon which this grammar is based has numerous examples of prefix androot-initial /w/ that were pronounced word internally as [m] (not [w]) by speakers. In contrast,
relatively few tokens of /r/ pronounced as [n] in identical contexts were recorded in natural
speech, even though speakers accepted such examples when prompted.
In connected speech, it is common in a sentence for all examples of word-initial /m/ and
/n/ to surface in their non-nasal allophonic form if the preceding word is vowel-final. This holds
especially true in rapid speech. However, according to the orthographic convention adopted in
this grammar, all word-initial /m/s and /n/s, regardless of their surface phonetic form, are written
as nasals.
The alternations between [m] and [n], and [w] and [r], have been a source of much
confusion in the ethnographic and linguistic literature. According to Matthews (1877: 91),
members of “a labial series consisting of m, b, and w, and a dental, or linguo-dental, series
consisting of d, l, n, and r [...] are subject to interchanges so arbitrary and frequent that no
definite rules can be given for them”. Carl Voegelin in the 1930s and Florence Robinett in the
1950s occasionally transcribed the word initial m/w in their field notes as a bilabial fricative [β]
that seems to correspond to Matthews’s orthographic b since both occur mainly before the vowel
i. However, b is certainly not an allophone or a free variant of m/w as is demonstrated by
numerous minimally different words. 44While some Hidatsa speakers apparently had [β] as an allophone of m/w in some circumstances, it wasdocumented from none of the Hidatsa consultants who collaborated with me on the present description.","[46, 47]"
"9.4 Focus particle -wa
The focus particle -wa derives D-words and it is used emphatically with pronominal and
demonstrative stems.
When -wa is suffixed to the pronominal stem íì or the demonstrative pronouns hirí, gúá,
and seˀ, it emphasizes the main argument of the verb (see 11.2.2). The emphasized argument is
usually the intransitive subject or the transitive object, but the ergative agent is also occasionally
emphasized, especially if the first person pronoun is followed by a transitive verb agentively
inflected for first person (with A-set or causative pronominal affixes) or the second person
pronoun is followed by a transitive verb similarly inflected for second person. Third person
pronouns and the demonstratives that represent the ergative agent are usually followed by the
ergative suffix -rí because the emphatic form with -wa would be too ambiguous and could be
interpreted as the object of the transitive verb.",[391]

The distinct identity of the focus particle is further confirmed by distributional facts as itmay be preceded by the ergative suffix -rí, which occurs in complementary distribution with the
indefinite article -wa and the definite article -s. An example is (22).

Finally, the focus morpheme derives interrogative pronouns from D-words that are stativeverbs (see 12.1). D-words that are derived with -wa are used to ask questions about the nonergative arguments S and O. The ergative case marker -rí is suffixed to the same stem instead of wa if the question asked is about the ergative argument A. D-words with -wa may be used
370instead of ergative D-words if the argument structure of the clause is disambiguated by other
means, such as by marking the first or second person transitive object with the B-set pronominal
prefixes on the stem (see 5.1). The derivation of absolutive (S or O) and ergative (A)
interrogative pronouns is given in TABLE 9.1.

The focus particle -wa may follow the ergative suffix -rí even in interrogative pronouns,
as in (23). Examples are rare in the corpus, but they are nevertheless possible.

In morphophonological terms it is not clear whether -wa is an affix or clitic. It derivesinterrogative D-words and could therefore be considered a derivational suffix. On the other hand,
the plural suffix -ˀa, which is otherwise always the last element in the stem, is inserted (infixed?)
between the root and -wa, as illustrated in (24) and (25). The final position of -wa in plural Dwords indicates that it may be an enclitic.

"1.6 Analytical framework
This dissertation is written within the framework of Basic Linguistic Theory, most thoroughly
expounded in Dixon (2010), which differs from explanatory theories mainly by “its attempt to
describe each language in its own terms, rather than trying to forge the language into a model
based on European languages” (Dryer 2006: 211). The supremacy of BLT over formal theories
becomes immediately apparent if one takes a short survey of descriptive grammars published
over the past forty five years in North America. Whereas only a few grammars written within the
generative framework that came into vogue after the Chomskian revolution have stood the test of
time, grammatical descriptions that have drawn on the cumulative insight offered by earlier
17descriptive grammars, as well as linguistic typology, have never lost their value and have, in fact,
served as the foundation whithout which the more fashionable formal or explanatory theories
could not exist.
As Dryer (2006: 212) correctly points out, “the idea that description can be atheoretical is
simply confused.” An atheoretical description is a practical impossibility since one cannot
describe anyting without making some theoretical assumptions. Exotic and novel notions, such
as pitch-accent, ergativity, and evidendiality, as well as more mundane commonly held
assumptions, such as the basic distinction between nouns and verbs, at some point all trace their
discovery to observational linguistic descriptions. Even if many descriptive linguists do not
subscribe to any explicit theories, the set of cumulatively growing assumptions and notions they
all share clearly indicates that they work within the same theoretical framework.","[40, 41]"

meaning and its co-occurrence with nouns that have specific referents in the real world is less
common. Still, in many cases -rú and -hgua are freely interchangeable, as in (5).

In other contexts, only -hgua is possible while -rú is ungrammatical, as in (6b) where therelational noun ibíìdi n. lower back, rump, rear end, postp. behind sth is interpreted literally.
When ibíìdi is used in a headless postpositional phrase, as in (6c), -rú is again grammatical.
Currently there is no explanation that would explain the licensing of -rú and -hgua in this and
other similar contexts.

"14.2 Exclamatory phrases
Exclamatory phrases are nonsentences formed with lexemes that have an independent semantic
value. They are classified as exclamations because they always occur without illocutionary
markers (see 6.1) and do not enter into syntactic relations. A question mark in (25), for instance,
suggests an interrogative speech-act, but the absence of the interrogative speech-act marker -ˀ
indicates that the utterance is actually an exclamation.
(25)Harúg
níg / níhgi(i)?

n-íhgii
and.then 2-PRO
How about you?!
The communicative value of exclamatory phrases is identical to interjections, i.e., theyexpress emotions and have a conventionalized emotive value when used as exclamations.
However, because of the inherent lexical meaning encoded in them, they do not belong to the
lexical category of semantically empty interjections.
The following are examples of exclamatory phrases:458•

What is it?< -dóòg SPEC
< -ˀ INTERSpeculative speech-acts are considered statements in some languages; however,
morphological restrictions indicate that on structural grounds they have to be considered
questions in Hidatsa. One of the indicators is that the speculative enclitic -dóòg must follow the
interrogative form of the future suffix (see 6.5.2). In example (76) the speculative enclitic is
preceded by the second person future suffix -rihi that is used only in questions. The same
sentence would be ungrammatical if the speculative enclitic were preceded by the second person
future tense suffix -ri, which is reserved for statements. Example (77) is a sentence from a
traditional text where the first person interrogative future tense suffix -wihi is used instead of the
more common first person future suffix -wi that is used only in statements.

"2256.1.1 Statements
Statements are utterances that denote factuality of unmarked epistemic value. In Hidatsa,
statements can be neutral (declarative), emphatic, assertive, exclamative, definitive, or
presumptive.6.1.1.1 -c ‘declarative’
Utterances with the declarative -c are neutral statements without any attitudinal overtones. It is
the most common speech-act marker in Hidatsa. There are numerous examples of neutral
statements ending with -c in this grammar. Sentences in (3) illustrate the fact that such statements
carry neutral illocutionary force regardless of their literal meaning.

Among the Hidatsa utterance initiators (see Chapter 14), one, gíí (the equivalent of English oh,
well, or oh well), may also occur utterance finally. In this position it has become grammaticalized
and merged with the preceding declarative marker -c (or definite marker -s, see 6.1.1.7). The
ensuing -cgíí expresses presupposition or hypothesis regarding the fact denoted by the verb. This226speech-act marker is (almost?) always preceded by one of the singular future suffixes (see
6.5.2). 53 The following are examples of presumptive statements with -cgíí.

"10Robinett’s doctoral dissertation was published in 1955 in the International Journal of
American Linguistics in three parts: (1) morphophonemics; (2) affixes; (3) stems and themes. In
addition to her use of Harris and Voegelin’s field notes, Robinett obtained additional data from
two Hidatsa consultants with whom she worked briefly in 1954 at Indiana University, and in the
field on the Fort Berthold Reservation.
For several decades, Robinett’s work remained a singular achievement in Hidatsa
linguistics. She describes the language within the framework of American structuralism,
specifically the item-and-arrangement model and templatic morphology. Each affix is assigned a
position number in the template. Each position or “slot” consists of mutually exclusive affixes
that have to occur in a fixed order relative to all other affixal “slots”. Robinett uses metaterms to
describe all the affixes according to their function, but gives very few actual examples of affixal
combinations (she does it in a more abstract manner, e.g., affixes x, y, and z may co-occur in
such-and-such (e.g., active) stems. Nevertheless, it is possible to use her work for textual
analysis, even if the process is quite laborious.
Robinett’s reliance on data recorded by others and her limited field work made it difficult
to avoid mistakes altogether. Another, more serious, source of mistranscriptions was her reliance
on poor-quality sound recordings that she worked with after rapid-speed elicitation sessions with
her informants, a technique deemed progressive at the time.
By and large, Robinett’s notation of pitch (which she analyzed as stress) is wholly
unreliable, and she provides incomplete or incorrect analyses of various verbal and adverbial
affixes. More serious are her analyses of some constructions – e.g., the ergative suffix –ri, which
she took for a demonstrative objectifier – that have been perpetuated in the subsequent literature,
whether describing Hidatsa, or used for comparison and proof in the secondary literature. This is11exemplified by the conclusions in Zwicky’s oft-quoted (1985b) paper on clitics and particles that
is based on data from four languages, one of which is Hidatsa. Zwicky’s erroneous Hidatsa data
came from Matthews (1965), whose analysis to a large extent was derived from, but not credited
to, Robinett.
G.H. Matthews’s Hidatsa Syntax (1965), written within the framework of early
transformational grammar, contains too many mistakes and erroneous analyses to enumerate here.
Furthermore, his analysis is so abstract that it is opaque. Matthews does not credit his sources,
but it is obvious that much of his data, as well as several incorrect conclusions, are actually
derived from Harris and Voegelin’s and Robinett’s work. Nevertheless, some of his claims about
Hidatsa have become accepted in the linguistic literature after Zwicky (1985b), who based his
broad theoretical claims partly on Matthews’s description.
After a long hiatus, in the 1970s, A. Wesley Jones engaged in direct work with Hidatsa
speakers under the auspices of the North Dakota Indian Languages Program (Mary College,
Bismarck, North Dakota). Jones’s work was greatly facilitated by his living close to the Fort
Berthold Reservation. The published materials resulting from his data collection include five
traditional narratives (Jones 1978; and in Parks 1978), a Hidatsa wordlist, and four papers (1979a,
1983, 1984b, 1992) that describe various morphological peculiarities of Hidatsa. Most of Jones’s
data collection topics focused on lexical material. He greatly augmented the size and quality of
the lexicon/vocabulary of recorded Hidatsa after “inheriting” Harris and Voegelin’s 1938 slip
files from Florence Robinett-Voegelin. By that time the files had been enlarged by slips of her
own re-elicitations. Jones collated the older lexical slips with his own and resystematized them
by dependent roots. Moreover, in the 1980s, Jones wrote some twenty papers, ranging in size
from two to thirty pages, that describe various aspects of Hidatsa morphophonology and most of12which remain unpublished. Copies of Jones’s manuscripts, together with the Harris-VoegelinRobinett slip file, are preserved at the American Indian Studies Research Institute, Indiana
University.
The most notable outcome of Jones’s lexicographic work was his Hidatsa word list,
(1979b), which remains a popular memory aid on the reservation. This glossary contains 1700 of
the most common Hidatsa words, presented in English-to-Hidatsa and Hidatsa-to-English
sections. However, the work does not provide any grammatical information, paradigmatic
examples, or usage notes.
Jones (1979a) is a unique paper that that describes what he calls “morphological
constellations.” By that he means the ability of various Hidatsa morphemes to appear as a lexical
stem, a prefix, or a suffix in various functions, thus presenting an array of bewildering
homophony.
The only major shortcoming of Jones’s transcriptions is the unreliability of his pitch
marking. According to Jones (personal communication), he tried to describe Hidatsa in terms of
stress-accent, only realizing after his field work that in reality it is a pitch-accent language. It also
turns out that his main informant, though fluent, was reputed to speak a highly idiosyncratic
idiolect, not representative of “standard” Hidatsa. A minor issue, also evident in Harris and
Voegelin (1939), is the uncertainty about what constitutes a “word” in Hidatsa. Compounding of
content words and combining lexical stems with grammatical and discourse particles seems
arbitrary in all of the published narratives.
Jones’s material serves as an invaluable source of Hidatsa vocabulary because he worked
with the last generation of “old-timers,” i.e., fluent speakers who knew old vocabulary. Even if
his recordings need to be re-elicited for pitch (and for weeding out the idiosyncrasies of his main13consultant), they are invaluable as prompts for older, less-used vocabulary that has receded into
passive memory in the present day.
Norman Bowers’s Hidatsa Suprasegmentals (1996), originally his doctoral dissertation,
is the most recent publication on Hidatsa. It is an eclectic work that combines almost every
conceivable phonetic feature into a unified description of Hidatsa phonology. Bowers describes
Hidatsa in terms of ±pitch, ±accent, ±stress, updrift-downdrift, and fortis-lenis. The last he
considers a phonemic difference, the other four phonetic.
Bowers makes an excessive claim (1996: 9) that without spectrograms it would have
been impossible to recognize the patterns of Hidatsa suprasegmentals or to demonstrate that they
are predictable. In total, his monograph comprises spectrograms of 32 isolated nominals and
inflected verbs accompanied by transcriptions, and virtually no other original data. In addition,
Bowers provides hundreds of abstract schemas for his analysis in the form c+v (for consonants
and vowels), which are supplemented by a bewildering array of diacritics without ever providing
any glosses or even transcriptions for most of the examples he claims to analyze, thus rendering
them impossible to verify. In fact, Bowers brings so much abstract detail into his analysis that it
has little meaning for understanding Hidatsa.
In comparison, Bowers’s master’s thesis, “A Generative Phonology and Dictionary of the
Hidatsa Indian Language” (1981), comprising close to two thousand alphabetically organized
lexemes, is a valuable resource that contains numerous lesser-used vocabulary items, probably
derived from Alfred Bowers’s unpublished textual material.
Finally, John Boyle has been working with Hidatsa textual material since the late 1990s,
supplementing his studies with occasional field work. In 2006, Boyle, in collaboration with
language consultant Alex Gwin, compiled a bidirectional Hidatsa-English-Hidatsa wordlist14(unpublished), based on the Voegelin-Harris-Robinett-Jones lexical slip files. Boyle’s work on
Hidatsa culminated in his Ph.D. dissertation, “Hidatsa Morpho-syntax and Clause Structure”,
written “in a generative framework generally following the Minimalist Program of Chomsky”
(2007: 20).
Since Boyle’s work is primarily based on previously compiled lexical corpora and
published texts, it suffers from the same issues that characterize those sources, notably the
wholly unreliable accent marking and paradigmatic gaps in the data sets. The main value of his
work resides in pulling together, systematizing, and making available the descriptions of various
grammatical phenomena characteristic of Hidatsa that have previously appeared in the published
and unpublished descriptions of Voegelin, Harris, Robinett, and Jones.","[33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"
"49016 Adpositions
The range of concepts expressed in many other languages by adpositions and case endings is
communicated in Hidatsa by a variety of morphological and lexical means, such as locative
verbal prefixes (see 4.4), other types of applicative prefixes (see 4.5), and a small number of
lexical verbs that have become bleached in certain syntactic constructions, such as gúˀ to give
something to somebody in benefactive constructions (see 17.5.2).
Nevertheless, Hidatsa also has two types of adpositions, bound postpositional suffixes
and independent postpositions. Both types of adpositional morphemes combine with noun
phrases and indicate the semantic relationship of that noun phrase to the verb (Dryer 2007: 8182).
The majority of adpositions indicate relations in space and time and postpositional
phrases serve usually as locative or temporal adverbial adjuncts. A small number of adpositional
morphemes indicate other types of relations, such as comitativity and instrumentality.","[513, 514]"
"2576.3 Aspect
Hidatsa has two aspectual categories that are indicated morphologically – the habitual and the
usitative that are expressed by suffixation; and two others, the continuative and the progressive,
are expressed periphrastically in serial constructions with auxiliary posture verbs (see 6.4). The
discussion in this section is limited to morphological exponence of grammatical aspect.6.3.1 -íì / -íìruˀ ‘habitual’
The habitual aspect describes activities and states that recur over time, generally out of habit.
Habitual verbs are also used in gnomic statements, such as ‘they speak Hidatsa’ , in contrast to
episodic statements, such as ‘they spoke Hidatsa last night’.
In (138a-b), the unmarked present progressive is contrasted with the present habitual, and
in (139) an unmarked past event with the past habitual. The habitual aspect in both examples is
expressed with the suffix -íì.

"1.4 Previous scholarship
The earliest historical records of the Hidatsa language include several 19th and early 20th
century wordlists of varying length. The most extensive early vocabularies are those recorded by
Thomas Say (in E. James 1822), Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied (M. Wied, Prinz zu.
81839-41), Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden (1862) and Edward S. Curtis (1907-30, Vol.4).
Lewis Henry Morgan (1871) contains kinship terms.
The first grammar sketch, which includes an extensive vocabulary, was compiled by
Washington Matthews, who served between 1865 and 1872 as a post surgeon in the United
States Army in what is now North Dakota. During his six years in Dakota Territory Matthews
became relatively fluent in Hidatsa. According to James Mooney (1905), Matthews lost all his
manuscript notes and his library when his quarters at Fort Buford burned in 1871. Nevertheless,
he was able to reconstruct from memory his Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the
Hidatsa, published in 1873. A revised version, entitled Ethnography and Philology of the
Hidatsa Indians, was published in 1877.
In his eleven page grammatical sketch Matthews succeeds in highlighting many of the
essential features of Hidatsa. The grammar is accompanied by a wordlist of almost 3000 entries,
including grammatical particles. Even though Matthews’s transcriptions are often excessively
phonemicized and therefore unreliable, his wordlist contains a number of interesting lexemes and
word forms that have disappeared from contemporary active usage as a consequence of culture
change.
In 1876, a twenty-nine-year old Congregational missionary, Charles Lemon Hall,
arrived at Fort Berthold where he remained until his death in 1940. In order to be more
successful in his activities, Hall resolved to learn all three native languages that were spoken on
the reservation. Without doubt he had most success with Hidatsa. Hall’s published materials
include a thirty-five-page pamphlet containing hymns and Bible passages (Hall 1906b), as well
as a six-page mythological narrative (Hall 1906a) with an interlinear translation. Hall’s most
significant unpublished materials include a manuscript Hidatsa phrasebook (Hall 1882) and an9annotated copy of Matthews’s (1873) dictionary (Hall 1876-90), both preserved at the State
Historical Society of North Dakota.
Between 1905 and 1918, Gilbert Livingston Wilson spent ten seasons on Fort Berthold
documenting Hidatsa culture. Included in the huge number of ethnographic data that he amassed
are valuable lexical terms for material culture and for local fauna and flora. Much of this material
remains unpublished.
Alfred Bowers’s fieldwork in the 1930s and 1960s resulted in a large collection of
Hidatsa texts, many of them sound recorded, all of which remain unanalyzed and unpublished.
In 1911, Robert H. Lowie collected four traditional Hidatsa texts while on a collecting
expedition for the American Museum of Natural History. Those texts were reelicited, transcribed,
and translated by Zellig Harris and Carl F. Voegelin in 1938 and published together with one
additional text that they themselves collected 1939. The published texts, comprising altogether
about 300 sentences, were translated, extensively annotated, and supplemented with
paradigmatic examples and morphological analyses of complex expressions. Although Harris
and Voegelin did not prepare a grammatical sketch of Hidatsa, the generalizations, sample
paradigms, and morphological analyses that they provide in extensive footnotes constitute the
first modern, albeit random and unorganized, description of many aspects of Hidatsa grammar.
As a byproduct, Harris and Voegelin’s fieldwork resulted in an alphabetically organized
lexical slip file containing about 800 inflected themes and several thousand word forms that to
this date remains unpublished.
In the 1950s, Voegelin passed the slip file on to Florence Robinett, who was then
writing a master’s thesis on Hidatsa morphophonology at Indiana University. In 1954, Voegelin
and Robinett co-published a paper on motherese in Hidatsa (Voegelin and Robinett 1954).","[31, 32, 33]"

Plural suffixes are incompatible with the coordinative suffix. Grammatical number of thesubject or the object in the coordinated clause is revealed by the plural suffix before the
illocutionary marker or the plural form of the illocutionary marker in the final clause, as in (43).
The grammatical number of the subject in the coordinated clause is disambiguated if a verb has

"61.3 Present situation
After reaching a historical low point in the 1870s and 1880s the Hidatsa population started
slowly to increase. In 1910 it reached 547 out of a total enrolled population of about 1,200 on the
Fort Berthold Reservation. In 1950, when the Hidatsa were counted separately for the last time,
they numbered 933 residing on the reservation.
By 2010, the number of enrolled members of the Three Affiliated Tribes exceeded
12,000, more than half of whom resided on the reservation. Although the exact number of
Hidatsas today is impossible to ascertain, it probably exceeds one half of the total reservation
population. Because of the large number of intertribal marriages, a growing number of tribal
members identify themselves as Mandan-Hidatsa, Hidatsa-Arikara, or with all three tribes.
Nevertheless, the western segment of the reservation is still predominantly Hidatsa. Even though
no statistics are available, according to my experience the Hidatsa are the dominant group on the
reservation in both population and influence on decision making, followed closely by the Arikara,
and then by the Mandan who have become almost completely assimilated into the Hidatsa.
Whereas the population has clearly rebounded, the trend has been the reverse for the
number of tribal language speakers. A hundred years ago virtually every Hidatsa was a speaker
of the language, and most tribal members were also able to speak Mandan and English with
varying degrees of fluency. Gilbert Wilson made the following observation about the language
situation in 1908:The Hidatsa and Mandan have been so closely associated for two or three
generations that tribal barriers are nearly broken down, except perhaps in the matter
of language. A child is reckoned as of his mother’s tribe, and speaks his mother’s7language; and even husband and wife, if not of the same tribe, address each the
other in his own language. Most of the Hidatsa on the reservation understand
Mandan, and every Mandan understands Hidatsa. In council or preaching service,
an orator of either tribe speaks his mother’s tongue, and no interpreter is necessary.
If Arikara are present, an interpreter must be called. (Wilson 1908:101)As of 2010, the situation is much starker. Only one fluent speaker of Mandan remains,
and a handful of imperfect Arikara speakers. Hidatsa has fared better, but only in comparison to
the other two languages. According to my informal survey of Hidatsa language usage, about 100
people still remain who are able to carry on a conversation in the language. Less than half of
them are considered really good speakers who are fully fluent in most genres of the language.
The majority of speakers are elderly. The youngest speakers, with a few rare exceptions, are in
their mid to late fifties.
The Hidatsa community has initiated several projects to reverse the trend. Hidatsa is now
taught in the New Town and Mandaree schools, as well as at Fort Berthold Community College.
The language programs have been effective in reinforcing tribal identity and instilling pride in
the culture but no speakers have come out of these programs, which suffer from the same set of
problems that plague language revitalization efforts across the country.","[29, 30, 31]"
"16.2.1 Comitative
The comitative relationship denotes companionship. Unlike many other languages, in Hidatsa the
comitative never denotes an instrument. (Instrumentality is expressed with the instrumental/goal
suffix -hdaa, see 16.1.2.1.1)
There are three ways to indicate a comitative relationship. First, a single person or object
in a comitative relationship is expressed with the comitative postposition áàbi with somebody, as
in (82)–(85). The noun may be omitted if it is recoverable from context.
(82)Áàbi náà!
áàbi néè-Ø
with go-IMP.SG
Go with him!",[537]
"6.5 Tense and mood
Hidatsa is a future–non-future language. Only the future tense is morphologically marked; verb
forms not inflected for the future are interpreted as referring to either the present or the past. The
concepts of futurity and modality are closely interrelated in Hidatsa and verb forms inflected for
the future are used for epistemic and deontic expressions.
There is also a morphologically marked irrealis category that is used both for future and
hypothetical statements.",[302]

autumn versus máàrac it is my arm.","[90, 91]"
"6.6 Further modal categories
Although modality can be expressed through a variety of strategies, such as lexically with
adverbs, several patterns have become grammaticalized in Hidatsa.
A universal modal suffix hahgá can express all three types of modality – epistemic,
deontic, and dynamic.
The lexical verb hirí to do something participates as an auxiliary in at least three
constructions: (1) the quasi-clausal auxiliary construction -gug hirí + FT, which is restricted to
epistemic modality, describes a possible event; (2) the definite auxiliary construction -s hirí
describes events that had a potential to happen in the past, and (3) the instrumental auxiliary
construction iihirí adds an intensive meaning to the preceding verb.
Finally, there are six semantically related and mutually exclusive constructions that Jones
(1992) subsumed under the label ‘approximatives.’ The approximatives express the ideas
“almost,” “nearly,” or “kind of ” (Jones 1992: 330). According to formal criteria, some of the
approximatives could be subsumed more appropriately under derivational morphology, whereas
others could be described more properly as auxiliary or serial verb constructions. However, here
289they are treated together because comparison between different approximatives is helpful in
clarifying finer distinctions in meaning.6.6.1 -hahgá ‘abilitative’
Depending on the context, the abilitative modal suffix -hahgá may express any of the three
modal families of meaning: it is interpreted (1) epistemically when the speaker communicates his
doubts, certainties, or guesses; (2) deontically when the meanings have to do with obligation or
permission; and (3) dynamically when the meaning is concerned with abilities and dispositions.
The abilitative verb stem occurs almost always with the irrealis marker aru-. The only
regular exception to this rule is expressions of estimation and approximation of amount or size.
When -hahgá has a dynamic interpretation, it either describes an ability to do something,
as in (260)–(263), or a disposition to do something, as in (264).

"894.2.2.1 Collective plural -aba
The collective plural suffix -aba is not used on the predicates of main clauses which are
pluralized with -ˀa and -ˀo. The distribution of the collective suffix is restricted to cosubordinate
clauses marked with -g (see 17.3), certain adverbial clauses (e.g., temporal clauses) and a few
adverbs. The collective suffix (1) disambiguates the grammatical number of the subject in the
non-matrix clause by marking it overtly as ‘plural’, and (2) views the individuals in question as a
group.
Examples (9a-b) demonstrate that independent clauses are unambiguous as to the
grammatical number of the subject. The default reading of the grammatical number in the nonmatrix clause in (9c) is singular, but the plural reading is also possible if context permits it. In
such cases the collective suffix -aba is used to eliminate ambiguity, especially if the number of
the subject needs clarification but is not apparent from the context. Example (9d) has an
unequivocally plural reading due to the presence of the collective marker.

demonstrative seˀ and the suffix -wa. Since a noun phrase cannot be definite and indefinite at the
same time, -wa is best analyzed as an emphatic or focusing particle here. Definite noun phrases
followed by seˀwa are particularly common with proper names and entitive relative clauses, as in
(19), and in possessive constructions, as in (20) and (21).

"4.2 Grammatical number
Hidatsa marks three grammatical persons, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, that follow four sets of inflectional
patterns. The sets, described in Chapter 3, are reproduced in TABLE 4.1.

iminí-The prefixal inflection mostly marks person (except for plural forms of motion verbs and
third person plural object prefix, described in 5.2); number is marked by a plural suffix. Hidatsa
verbs and pronouns, as well as predicatively used or possessed nouns, are inflected in the
singular and plural. Singular is the unmarked form. Unlike many other Siouan languages,
Hidatsa does not distinguish between inclusive and exclusive forms, and there is no dual.4.2.1 -ˀa and -ˀo ‘plural’
The principles of plural formation with -ˀa and -ˀo are largely identical for nouns and verbs and
the discussion in this section applies equally to both. (The plural pronominal morpheme -roˀ,
which is inserted between the basic pronominal root íì- and the rest of the stem, is described
separately in 11.2.)
The plural suffix -ˀa only occurs with the stem if it is directly followed by any suffixes or
enclitics except the interrogative speech-act marker -ˀ (see 6.1.2.1) and the vocative construction
86(see 14.4). Most types of stem-final syllables are subject to morphophonological change before
the plural suffix (for details on ablaut see section 2.4.1). The following rules apply in plural
formation:
•The vowel in the plural morpheme is deleted if the stem ends with a short a or i. The final
vowel in a few lexically determined noun stems, such as ahí turnip, is not deleted and the
plural suffix is added directly to the unmodified stem, as in ahíˀo turnips. The short u is
not deleted, but in some speakers’ speech the plural form is reduced to a diphthong and a
glottal stop sequence.","[109, 110]"
"Whereas progressive constructions with -réè simply express ongoing processes, as in (333a),
auxiliary constructions with níhee indicate that the process is near completion, as in (333b).

"9.6 Argument disambiguation
In Hidatsa, the nominal clause arguments Agent, Subject, and Object are regularly omitted if
they are recoverable from the pragmatic context, preceding text, or from grammatical concord,
376therefore transitive constructions where both nominal arguments (Agent and Object) are overtly
realized are not common. New participants are often introduced as subjects of intransitive
clauses (e.g., “and then N came’) or objects of transitive clauses (e.g., ‘and then he saw N’). After
the new participant has been introduced, it seldom occurs as an overt noun phrase, unless the
participant structure needs to be refreshed after some other participant intervenes.
(36) is a passage from a traditional trickster story, told by Anna Wicker and recorded by
A. Wesley Jones in 1977. In the first sentence, the first participant, the mythical First Maker, is
introduced with an overt noun phrase which is not repeated again in the passage. In the second
sentence he sees two men, who are again introduced with an overt noun phrase. The two men are
referred to explicitly again in the third sentence when the focus shifts from the First Maker to the
men.

377The First Maker was travelling along (they say). He was roaming around, traveling
along the riverbank and scrutinizing the landscape; he was doing that, going around, and
there were two men sitting there, catching fish at the river (they say). Standing here he
watched them and he examined them and one could hear the men talking to each other,
but they were not looking around (they say). (Jones 1978: 5)
If a transitive clause has two overtly expressed arguments outside the verb stem, they
need to be disambiguated from each other. The need for disambiguation becomes even more
pronounced in light of the relatively flexible word order that Hidatsa has. The unmarked
constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons.
The order of A and B-set agreement prefixes on a transitive stem, which, with a few exceptions,
always follows the order O-A (B-set prefix followed by a A-set prefix), is never affected by the
pragmatic constituent order outside the stem.
Besides word order, Hidatsa relies on two strategies to disambiguate overtly expressed
clausal arguments. The first strategy relies on the relative ranking on the animacy scale (see 9.6.1)
and the second one on the relative ranking on the agentivity scale (see 9.6.2) .","[399, 400, 401]"
"5.1 Split-intransitivity
From a typological perspective, Hidatsa is a split-intransitive type language (also known as an
active-stative type language). This means that the core arguments of a clause are marked by two
types of pronominal prefixes that are grouped into two sets: the A-set prefixes (1 maa-, 2 ná-, 3 Ø)
mark the transitive agent and the subject of the first subset of intransitive verbs, whereas the Bset prefixes (1 mii-, 2 nii-, 3 Ø) mark the transitive object as well as the subject of the second
subset of intransitive verbs. The primary principle that divides intransitives into the two subsets
is based on control: the S-argument is marked like an agent (A) if the subject is in control of the
intransitive activity; it is marked like a transitive object (O) if the subject is not in control of an
intransitive activity49. Since the grammatical subject S is marked by two different types of
prefixes, such a system is also known as a split-S alignment.
Intransitive verbs that mark the subject with B-set prefixes are called ‘stative verbs’. Most
of the stative verbs describe states and qualities, such as hisí to be red and xaráhxi be skinny, but
49The only exception to this generalization is the plural object prefix maa- (see 5.2) which never occurs in the roleof an intransitive subject.",[234]
