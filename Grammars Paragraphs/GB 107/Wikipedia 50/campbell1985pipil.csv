Appendix 1 Pipil and Other Varieties of Nahua911Appendix 2 Varieties of Nahua in Guatemala936Bibliography943Chapter 1
Introduction0. Introduction
The native language of western El Salvador, the subject of this
book, is known in the linguistic literature as Pipil, although its
speakers call it na:wat in the language itself and Nahuate in
Spanish. Here it is called Pipil because this usage is so strongly
entrenched in the scientific literature that it could not easily be
changed. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that Na:wat (Nahuate) may
gain more general acceptance in honor of and in deference to its
speakers.
This book, then, presents a description of this
language.
This chapter is concerned with the present and past geographical
distribution of Pipil, its history to the extent that it is known,
its genetic classification, and its dialects. The following three
chapters present a description of the language's structure: its
phonology (chapter 2), its lexical categories and morphology (chapter 3), and its syntax (chapter A). Chapter 5 contains the PipilSpanish-English dictionary representing the two main dialects,
Cuisnahuat (C) and Santo Domingo de G u z m á n (SD), with occasional
forms from other dialects.
Chapter 6 is the Spanish-Pipil
dictionary. Chapter 7 contains folkloric texts accompanied by a
morpheme-by-morpheme analysis and translation in Spanish and a more
flowing English narrative translation. Many of the examples cited
in other chapters are taken from these texts, which are coded with
a letter to identify the narrative involved and a number which
refers to the line within the text. The appendices contain additional historical information. Appendix 1 compares Pipil in detail
with other southern varieties of Nahua in order to determine
precisely its relationship to them. Appendix 2 solves the controversial question concerning the Nahua of central Guatemala, which
have often been assumed to be Pipil but w h i c h turn out to be in
origin post-Conquest and from central Mexico.
The purpose of this book, then, is to present a basic reference
work on Pipil, a sort of ""handbook"" of the language.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"4.5. Imperatives
In the morphology it was seen that the second person imperative
prefix was x(i)-. other persons taking the exhortative particle
ma:, with -kan (underlying -kam-) for plural persons (section
3.7.8.1). Here examples of imperatives in sentential contexts and
the negative imperative construction are considered.
A.5.1. Imperative and hortatory sentences. Some examples of
sentences which illustrate the various imperative forms and the
hortatory/subjunctive ma: are:1161) xi-k-ilwi ma: yawi. (SD)
IMP-him-tell that go.
""Tell him to go.""
2) xi-k-ilwi (ka) te: ma: yawi. (SD)
IMP-him-tell (that) no that go.
""Tell him not to go."" (Literally, ""tell him that he not
go"".)
3) tesu ni-k-neki ma: xi-k-mikti. (SD)
no I-it-want that IMP-it-kill.
""I don't want you to kill it."" = ""I want that you not kill
it."" (Notice the 'second person imperative' xi- used here
just as a Spanish subjunctive after a verb of ""desire"".)
4) inmediatamente ki-chih-ki ordinär i-siwa:-w ma: ki-mikti
ne chumpipi pal ki-kwa-t. (H-ll)
immediataely her-do-PRET order his-wife-POSS that it-kill
the turkey for it-eat-PL.
""Immediately (he) ordered his wife to kill the turkey so
they (could) eat it.""
5) k-ilwih-ke-t ma: ki-ma:walti chi:l. (N-8)
him-tell-PRET-PL that her-smear chili.
""They told him that (he should) smear her (with) chili."" =
""They told him to smear her with chili.""
6) a:xa:n
xi-k-itski-kan
tu-lama, ma: ki-panu-lti ne
i-a:xi:x. (N-137)
now IMP-her-grab-PL IMP our-grandmother, that it-pass the
her-urine.
""Now grab our grandmother; let (her) pass her urine.""
7) ki-xi:pe:h-ke-t wan ki-maka-ke-t ne ln-laraa ma: ki-mana.
it-skin-PRET-PL and it-give-PRET-PL the their-grandmother
that it-cook.
""They skinned it and gave it to their grandmother to cook.""
4.5.2. Negative imperatives. Second person negative imperatives
are formed with te: ""no"" (C) or ma:/maka (SD), plus the x(i)~
imperative prefix (and -kan in the plural); this should not be
confused with the ma: 'hortatory' particle which occurs with other
persons in imperative constructions (cf. section 3.7.8.1).
Some
examples are:117
1) ma: x-u (SD)
te: xi-yu (C)don't go!2) te: xi-k-kwa-kan (C)don't eat it (you pl.)!3) te: xi-k-elka:wa (C)don't forget it!4) ma: xi-nech-mikti (S)
maka xi-nech-mikti (S)don't kill me!
don't kill me!5) maka xi-k-mikti (S)don't kill it!6) te: xi-kwa-kan nu-xu:leh-yu. (N-42)
Don't eat (you pl.) my husband!","[129, 130, 131]"
"4.1. Word order
In traditional parlance i t would be said that P i p i l word order
i s "" r e l a t i v e l y f r e e "" ; in the case of P i p i l this means that i t i s
pragmatically determined, depending on focus and on topic-comment
arrangements. F i r s t the order of s e n t e n t i a l elements in simple
declarative sentences w i l l be described, then these orders w i l l be
illustrated with examples. I t i s to be kept in mind that the verb
bears pronominal a f f i x e s which c r o s s - r e f e r e n c e subjects and obj e c t s , and when these are pronominal, the sentence may lack any
other indication of these arguments, relying solely on the subject
and object pronominal p r e f i x e s to signal these r o l e s . The most
natural, least marked order for intransitive sentences i s :
Verb-Subject (VS)102
Example sentences with Intransitive Verb and its subject are:
1) ya:h-ki ka-dentroh ne ta:ka-tsin. (N-23)
go-PRET in-inside the man-DIMIN.
""The little man went inside.""
2) mu-tamu:ta ne tsuntekuma-t. (N-33)
REFLEX-throw the skull.
""The skull throws itself.""
3) miki-k ne raasa:-t. (N-37)
die-PRET the deer.
""The deer died.""
4) al fin de tanto wa:ki-k ne masa:-t. (N-43)
In the end dry-PRET the deer.
""In the end the deer dried up.""
5) ya:h-ki ne tengerecheh. (N-127)
go-PRET the lizard.
""The lizard went.""
6) mu-kwep-ki ne tengerechul. (N-129)
REFLEX-return-PRET the lizard.
""The lizard returned.""
7) ni:kan naka-k ne tehitah. (N—131)
here stay-PRET the small tile.
""The small tile stayed here.""
8) ne: tami-k ne tan-tepus-lama. (N-140)
There terrainate-PRET the tooth-iron-old woman.
""The Iron-toothed-old-woman ended there.""
9) yawi-t-a wi:ts-et ne nu-pila:-wan-tsi-tsin. (R-21)
go-PL-already come-PL the my-son-PL POSS-PL DIMIN.
""My little sons are going to come now.""
10) mu-chih-ki alegrár ne piltsin-tsín. (R-26)
REFLEX-do-PRET rejoice the boy-DIMIN.
""The little boy rejoiced.""
The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is:
Verb-Object-Subject (VOS)103
VOS order is taken as basic because it occurs with the greatest
frequency in texts and conversation, and it is the only order for
transitive sentences which is neutral with respect to focus and
emphasis (see below). This is a relatively rare order in the
world's languages and deviates from the VSO basic order of
Classical Nahuatl and most other extant Nahua dialects. Since
neighboring Xincan and Mayan languages have VOS basic order, one
wonders whether Pipil has been influenced by these in any way (cf.
Campbell 1978).
A few examples of transitive verbs with both subject and object
are:
1) ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin. (N-23)
it-place the his-jacket the man-DIMIN.
""The little man put down his jacket.""
2) mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe. (N-121)
you pl.-give-PERF the advice the youngest son.
""The youngest son has given you (pi.) the advice.
3) kin-maka-k pwestoh ne prínsipeh ne se:yuk
pih-pi:pil-met. (R-56)
them-give-PRET office the prince the other PL-boy-PL.
""The prince gave the other boys (a) position.""
4) ki-chih-ke-t ne ti:-t ne pipil-tsi-tsín. (C)
it-make-PRET-PL the fire-ABSOL the boy-PL-DIMIN.
""The boys made the fire"".
5) ki-miktih ne wa:kax ne ta:ka-t. (C)
it-kill the cow the man-ABSOL.
""The man killed the cow.""
The orders:
Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)
also occur, but with less frequency. The order SVO is used specifically to place greater emphasis on the subject. The VSO order is
rare except when the object is ""heavy"", i.e. when it contains a
relative clause or a coordinate noun phrase. In this way Pipil
conforms to the word-order universal that has been postulated for
VOS languages that a ""heavy"" object is not permitted and is usually
shifted to the end, giving VSO with heavy objects as a very common104
corollary order in basically VOS languages (cf. Campbell and Mithun
1981).
The following are examples of other orders of transitive verb
sentences which have both an overt sujbect and object. The first
two illustrate VSO w i t h ""heavy"" objects. The third and fourth are
cases of VSO with the object bearing emphasis. The final two are
SVO sentences in which the subject is emphasized.
1) VSO: te: ki-kwah pe:lu ne uh-u:mi-t nike ne plumah.
(H-14) (""heavy"" object = coordinate noun phrase)
no it-ate dog the PL-bone-ABSOL nor the feather(s).
""(The) dog didn't eat the bones nor the feathers.""
2) VSO: ki-ahsi-k ne alkalteh ne mache ka ki-puluh-tuk
hwan. (C) (""heavy"" object = relative clause)
it-find-PRET the mayor the machete that it-lose-PERF Juan.
""The mayor found the machete that Juan had lost.""
3) VSO: k-al-wi:ka i-na:n uk na:wi pan ombrón.
(object emphasis)
him-DIR-take his-mother other four bread big.
""His mother brings him another four large breads.""
4) VSO: k-al-i:ka-t

""The three little boys brought some little fish.""","[115, 116, 117, 118]"

tesu katka

(with negative ""nowhere"")

no one, nobody

nowhere, there is/are not
nothing
nothing3.3. Articles and demonstratives
3.3.1. Articles. The Pipil definite and indefinite articles
correspond roughly in meaning and function to those of Spanish,
although they act a bit more like demonstratives. That is, these57
articles are slightly less obligatory than those of Spanish or
English, and when they are used, they have slightly more demonstrative force. Thus ne ta:ka-t might be translated equally well as
""the man"" or ""that man"" on many occasions. These are:
ne
se:the
a/an (a certain)In normal speech ne is frequently pronounced ili and se: is se
without vowel length.
3.3.2. Demonstrative pronouns and adjectives. The following
function as demonstrative pronouns when they occur independently
(as in ini ga:laSn ""this (one) is pretty"") and as demonstrative
adjectives when then appear with nouns (e.g. ini siwarpil
ga:la:n(a) ""this girl is pretty""). The forms are:
ini
uni
ne:ne: (C)
yahane (SD)
yahini (SD)
yahuni (SD)this (proximate, immediate)
that (distal, non-immediate)
that (more emphatic, less frequent)
that (distal, non-immediate)
this (proximate, immediate)
that (distal, non-immediate)It will be noted that Santo Domingo de Guzmán has some demonstratives composed of others compounded with yaha 'third person singular pronoun': yahane appears to be from yaha + ne: ""there'V'that';
yahini from yaha + ini; yahuni from yaha + uni.
3.3.3. Demonstrative adverbs. The demonstrative adverbs are of
location (L), time (T), purpose (P), and manner (M). They are:
kanah (L)
elsewhere, somewhere
ikuni (L)
(over) there (ik-uni)
ne: (L)

"1434.19. -chiwa + Spanish infinitive. Often so-called minority
languages, spoken in the social or political setting where some
other language dominates them in power or prestige (usually in
situations involving extensive bilingualism) contain constructions
for employing directly unassimilated forms from the dominant
language. Very often this involves the native verb ""to do"" plus an
infinitive from the dominant language, as is the case of Pali forms
used in Burmese, Arabic loans in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and of
Chinese borrowings into Japanese, among others. In some of these
languages it is a former contact situation of dominance which has
left its reflexes, although the domination no longer exists.
Spanish verbs are employed in this way in various Mayan languages
and other Indian languages of Mesoamerica. Pipil utilizes -chiwa
""to do"" plus unassimilated Spanish infinitives , which provides
Pipil, in effect, with the richness of Spanish concepts not easily
expressed in Pipil, and allows speakers access to the prestige of
Spanish even in cases where Pipil has perfectly equivalent verbs.
It is also used frequently when the Pipil form is not readily
remembered. Since the Spanish infinitive also functions as a nominallzation, structurally it is not so strange to see it with -chiwa
""to do"", where it could be thought of as something like, e.g.
ni-k-chiwa luchâr ""I do fighting"", i.e. ""I fight"". In this construction, the tenses, aspects, pronominal subjects and objects,
reflexives, etc. are born by -chiwa and the Spanish infinitive does
not vary.
While these infinitives are not properly speaking part
of Pipil, they are presented in the examples and in the texts in
the Pipil practical orthography and not in Spanish spelling. Some
examples taken from the texts are the following; for the full
sentential contexts see these texts:
1) mu-chiw-ki proponér (H-6)
it was proposed (cf. Sp. se propuso)
2) ki-chiw-ki desplumár (H-12)
(she) plucked it (cf. Sp. lo desplumó)
3) mu-chiw-ke-t afihár (H-13)
they noticed (cf. Sp. se fijó)
4) ki-chiw-ki kontestár (H-18)
(he) answered (it) (cf. Sp. lo contestò)
5) mu-chiw-ke-t elebár wan mu-chiw-ke-t desaparesér (U-26)
REFLEX-do-PRET-PL rise and REFLEX-do~PRET-PL disappear.

"El uso de esta frase932
sustituye en mucho al uso del sufijo continuativo -tok de
los verbos. (García de León 1976:74)
Here it is composed of a verb nemi ""to walk, go"" (andar) plus main
verb (cf. CN nemi ""to live"", nehnemi ""to go, walk""). On the other
hand, Wolgemuth (1980:107) presents it as a true progressive construction, e.g. nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In Pipil, one might
expect a progressive construction from a verb meaning ""to be"", as
is the case in many other languages of the world, e.g. English ""I
am eating"" or Spanish ""estoy comiendo"". Moreover, Isthmus Nahua
has a progressive suffix, -tok, as do several other varieties of
Nahua, which Pipil lacks. Therefore, while Pipil and Isthmus Nahua
share a similarity in this case, it is possible that it is due to
independent innovation of the progressive construction, just as was
the case with English and Spanish, related languages which independently developed progressives from forms of the verb ""to be"".
Other dialects also contain auxiliary constructions with nemi, but
with it postposed, e.g. mo-laluhti-nemi ""(he) goes (about) running""
(anda corriendo) in Michoacan Nahua (Beller and Beller 1979:282),
wikati-nemi ""sings habitually"" in La Huasteca Nahua (Sischo
1979:355), while Tetelcingo has an 'ambulative' construction,
-ti-nemi (Brewer 1969:46), to which CN kwala:n-ti-nemi ""to go
(around) getting angry"" (andar enojándose) may be compared. It is
also possible, however, given the greater similarity in form and
meaning, that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua share this trait due to some
common history; at this time, it is simply unclear.
Canger's second feature shared by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua is
-pal 'possession', e.g. i-pal ""his/hers/its"", no-pal / nu-pal
""mine"", etc. Other dialects have a cognate relational noun -pal,
but generally with the basic meaning of ""by, with, near, by means
of, for"". However, these also have contexts with a possessive
sense, e.g. CN te:-pal ""someone's"" (ajeno). At the same time,
Pipil has contexts with the meaning ""by, for"", e.g. pal ""by, for,
in order to"" (conjunction), ""of, from, by"" (possessive,
directional). It is possible that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua have
innovated together the basic sense of possession, but this is by no
means clear.
Finally, Canger (1978:14) presented certain lexical items shared
by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua, but these are not shared exclusively by
these two varieties (nor by these plus Sierra de Puebla Nahua).
For example, koyame-t / kuyame-t ""pig"" is found in Pipil, Isthmus
Nahua, Michoacan, and Quetzalapa; others tend to have pitso-t(l).
The form teksis-t(l)i ""egg"" is found in Pipil,
Isthmus,
and
La
Huasteca;
others
have totol-te- t(l). tle-tl. tli-tl, or933
tlexuch-tli.
In sum, these similarities may suggest a possible closer genetic
connection between Pipil and Isthmus Nahua (and perhaps these two
with the Sierra de Puebla), but their genetic significance is
inconclusive and Pipil's striking differences (cited above) should
be kept in mind.
2. Glottochronology. Several calculations of Nahua glottochronology have been presented which involve Pipil and upon which
claims about Nahua classification have been based, e.g. Swadesh
1954-1955, 1963, 1967, Kaufman 1974, Garcia de León 1976,
Luckenbach and Levy 1980, and Fowler 1981. While glottochronology
is at best highly controversial, nevertheless proposals for Pipil
based on these calculations should be discussed. To begin with,
however, it should be mentioned that glottochronology has been
largely discredited, its basic assumptions have been challenged,
and its results often prove erroneous (cf. Campbell 1977:62-5).
Garcia de León has placed Pipil close to Veracruz and Tabascan
varieties based on his counts. He says:
En cuanto a las relaciones internas del nahua del Golfo
lo más significativo es el hecho de que la distancia
interna mayor es de 9 siglos mínimos (between
Cosoleacaque and Jalupa); en tanto que el pipil
salvadoreño sólo difiere 6 siglos de Tuxtlas, Jaltipan,
Pajapan, Boquiapan y Jalupa, lo cual indica que el
primero es producto de un movimiento reciente que se
efectuó en tiempos históricos (sólo 2 siglos antes de la
Conquista); o bien, que habiéndose movido desde antes,
fue hasta 6 siglos que perdió el contacto con la costa
del Golfo. No seria nada aventurado suponer que antes
del 1300 dC existia una continuidad de grupos nahuas
desde Veracruz y Tabasco, hasta Guatemala y El Salvador;
pasando por los Altos de Chiapas (dialecto del nahua del
que quedaban hasta hace poco hablantes en Soyaló y
Bochil) y por la costa del Soconusco (Huehuetán y otros).
Probablemente, la expansión de los señoríos quichés y
cakchiqueles de Guatemala favoreció la separación que
explicaría los 6 siglos de divergencia entre el nahua del
Golfo y el salvadoreño. (García de León 1976:41)
García de León presented the Swadesh list of 100 words in various
Gulf dialects, but did not include the Pipil words with which he
compared them to arrive at his dates. He calculated that Pipil
shares 84% with the Nahua of Los Tuxtlas, Pajapan, Jáltipan934
(Veracruz), and Boquiapan (Tabasco), a separation of 5.8 minimum
centuries. His Gulf Nahua varied from 8 to 13 centuries with
respect to ""Mexihca"" ( C l a s s i c a l Nahuatl) and to other Nahua d i a l e c t s , which compares w e l l with Kaufman's f i g u r e of 11 minimum
centuries f o r General Nahua, i . e . Nahua minus Pochutec (Kaufman
1974:73).
Luckenbach and Levy (1980), basing t h e i r c a l c u l a t i o n s on 25
dialects, follow Swadesh (1954-1955) in believing that the interd i a l e c t a l r e l a t i o n s h i p s are ""properly thought of as 'chains' or
' n e t s ' , where each d i a l e c t has i t s c l o s e s t a f f i n i t i e s with i t s
immediate neighbor"" (p.456). They support the traditional threeway s p l i t in Nahua of ""Nahuatl, Nahual, and Nahuat ( P i p i l ) , and a
variant i s o l a t e from Pochutla"" (p.456). They c a l c u l a t e the e a r l i e s t separations f o r Pochutla (= Pochutec) and Xochitlahuaca,
Guerrero from the remainder of Nahua at 543 A.D., with their Nahuat
( P i p i l ) node s p l i t t i n g o f f at 801 A.D. and with ""a Nahuat-Nahuatl
divergence ... calculated at A.D. 1072, and younger Intradialectic a l ( s i c ) nodes ... found f o r Nahuat (A.D. 1257), Nahual (A.D.
1442), and Nahuatl (A.D. 1304 and 1511)"" (p.457).
Fowler's (1981) c a l c u l a t i o n s correspond to these in s e v e r a l
ways. He placed the f i r s t s p l i t , that of Pochutec from other
Nahua, at 15 centuries ago, ca. 500 A.D.. He equated the "" f i r s t
P i p i l migrations out of c e n t r a l Mexico i n t o the lowlands of
Veracruz and Central America"" (p.539-43) with a group he c a l l e d
""Nahuat"" (a _ t - d i a l e c t ) , which includes Zacapoaxtla, Chicontepec,
T a t e l a , Mecayapan, and El Salvador.
He placed t h i s Nahuat
migration at ca. 801 and put the beginnings of i t s i n t e r n a l
divergence at ca. 965 A.D. This matches Kaufman's (1974) date of
900 to 1,000 f o r the P i p i l migrations.
S p e c i f i c a l l y , Fowler
(1981:536) presents the following years of separation:
1142 Salvador and Classical Nahuatl
1097 Salvador and North Puebla
942 Salvador and Milpa Alta
1312 Salvador and Mecayapan
1424 Salvador and Pochutec
993 Salvador and Zacapoaxtla
555 Salvador and Las Tuxtlas
1044 Salvador and Tatela
1044 Salvador and Chicontepec
Even i f these glottochronologlcal dates could be accepted with
confidence, they would s t i l l present d i f f i c u l t i e s of i n t e r p r e t a tion. For example, given Garcia de León's 7 centuries of internal
v a r i a t i o n among his Gulf d i a l e c t s (e.g. between Mecayapan and935
Jalupa), one must ask how Salvadoran Pipil's separation could be
shorter (only 6 centuries when compared with certain of these
dialects; Garcia de León 1976:41). Ethnohistorical sources seem to
indicate longer separation, but they, too, are difficult to interpret unambiguously (see below). In any event, successful classification cannot be based on glottochronology.
The main question is whether the similarities shared by Pipil
and other Nahua varieties (especially Isthmus (Gulf) and Sierra de
Puebla) indicate a closer genetic relationship, or, whether Pipil's
marked differences mean that it is to be considered a distinct
variety with no closer connection to these other dialects. Given
the untrustworthy nature of Nahua dialectology and the unclear
status of the shared traits, it is possible that the question may
have no satisfactory answer. Nevertheless, based on standard
criteria for classification, I believe that Pipil is a distinct
branch. The similarities are either retentions of Proto-Nahua
features (which dialects may share by virtue of not having changed,
regardless of possible closer connections) or are parallel, independent innovations (changes that easily take place independently).
On the other hand, Pipil's differences are not so easily explained
away. To repeat just one example, Pipil preserves original -_t
'plural', which has changed to -h (or corresponding
in all
others except Pochutec. This means that these others share an
innovation which argues that they were still unified when Pipil
split off, after which they changed to -h (~2) and subsequently
broke up into the extant variants. The only alternative historical
explanation that is at all plausible is the possibility that Pipil
and certain others were closer relatives, splitting off as a single
branch, with Pipil subsequently withdrawing while its remaining
close relatives underwent the -t_ to -h change under influence from
other dialects which had formerly so changed. While this is not
impossible, one would need to be able to show that Pipil and its
assumed closer relatives shared certain innovations before the
break up. The similarities are not compelling in this regard.
Moreover, there ought to be evidence of the assumed later diffusion of the -jt to -Ji change in the others, but such evidence is
unknown.
Thus, while it is not impossible that Pipil bears some closer
connection to dialects of Veracruz, Tabasco, or elsewhere, the
evidence suggests rather its long independence.
It is best
considered an independent branch of Nahua, not a member of Core
Nahua, but having split off from the rest of the family after
Pochutec was first separated.","[947, 948, 949, 950, 951]"

Pipil-Spanish-English Dictionary5.0. Introduction
This dictionary covers the two P i p i l dialects which today have
the greatest number of speakers, Cuisnahuat (abbreviated (C)) and
Santo Domingo de Guzmán (signaled by (SD)). Entries are preceded
by either (C) or (SD) to identify the dialect.
When both dialects
contain a form, the Cuisnahuat version i s l i s t e d f i r s t ( i . e . , in
alphabetical order), followed by the Santo Domingo de Guzmán form.
Material common to the two d i a l e c t s i s presented only in the
Cuisnahuat entry and not repeated f o r the Santo Domingo de Guzmán
version.
Nevertheless, when there are d i f f e r e n c e s , these are
given. Also, occasionally forms from other d i a l e c t s are l i s t e d ,
identified by the name of the dialect before the entry.
P i p i l words are given with both a Spanish and an English gloss.
The Spanish glosses are given p r i m a r i l y in the l o c a l Spanish of
this part of El Salvador. When this d i f f e r s greatly from standard
Spanish or the variants understood in Guatemala and Mexico, a more
general Spanish translation i s also given, i f i t i s known. In some
instances, mainly in the case of names f o r of wild plants and
animals, local Spanish usage i s a l l that i s known. In such cases,
a b r i e f d e s c r i p t i o n i s given. In a few cases the meaning i s not
secure; these are marked with a question mark in parenthesis, i.e.
( ? ) . In cases where the English name of plants or animals i s not
known, i t i s simply listed with the abbreviation sp. standing f o r
""species"", e.g. ""chichipince"", bush sp. Sometimes various names or
distinct pronunciations of a single name f o r the same thing exist
in the l o c a l Spanish. In such cases, the multiple names and pronunciations are listed in the glosses, with f i r s t priority given to
the names used by my consultants.
The entries also contain morphological information which i s not
p r e d i c t a b l e or i s otherwise i r r e g u l a r .
In unclear cases, the
syntactic category of the word i s signaled by abbreviations (see
l i s t at the beginning of this book) such as t.v. 'transitive verb',
i . v . ' i n t r a n s i t i v e verb 1 , iij_ 'noun', coni., 'conjunction', e t c . In146
particular, nouns are listed with their plurals (pi.) and possessed
forms (poss.), since these are not predictable. Adjectives are
also often given with their plural forms. Similarly, verb entries
are l i s t e d in the present stems (pres.), but t h e i r p r e t e r i t e
( p r ê t . ) and perfect (perf.) forms are also c i t e d , since these, in
e f f e c t , indicate to which verb c l a s s the entry belongs. Since
these verb forms are not always predictable from knowledge of their
verb class, the actual cases provide additional information beyond
class membership. Other morphemes named in the entries, together
with t h e i r abbreviations, are t a - 'unspecified object', causative
(caus.), a p p l i c a t i v e ( a p p l i c . ) , object incorporation (incorp.),
etc. In particular i t i s important to keep in mind that reflexive
verb forms (abbreviated r . v . ) a r e l i s t e d in the d i c t i o n a r y
according to the r o o t , and not by the prefix mu- which they bear.
Thus, a verb root with both active and reflexive forms has only one
entry, but with forms signaled t.v. ( ' t r a n s i t i v e verb') and r.v.
( ' r e f l e x i v e verb'). Verbs which only appear as r e f l e x i v e s are
given with the mu- prefix, but listed alphabetically according to
the root.
Forms with a hyphen ( - ) contain a morpheme boundary. Thus, a
hyphen appears between the elements of c e r t a i n compound words.
E n t r i e s with the hyphen at the beginning o b l i g a t o r i l y bear some
other morpheme, a p r e f i x . For example, intimately ( s o - c a l l e d
' i n a l i e n a b l y ' ) possessed nouns do not occur without a possessive
pronominal prefix; the presence of a hyphen shows this. Also, the
absolutive suffix of nouns is separated with a hyphen for greater
clarity. Morphemes which have a special shape in compounds or when
incorporated are c i t e d with t h e i r glosses in single quotes, e.g.
ku:- 'head*. When forms occur which are known only from compounds
but do not appear as such elsewhere, they are given with the gloss
in parentheses, e.g. tankwa- ('knee'). Non-lexical, grammatical
morphemes are also cited in single quotes, while other glosses are
found with no special marking or in double quotes (""..."").
The alphabetical order followed s t r i c t l y in the dictionary i s :
a, a : , b, eh, d, e, e : , f , g, h, i , i : , k, kw, 1,
m, n, o, o : , p, r , ( r r ) , s, t , u, u:, w, x, y.
This order frequently does not permit derivationally related forms
to be l i s t e d in adjacent e n t r i e s . However, t h i s i s no problem,
since r e l a t e d forms contain c r o s s - r e f e r e n c e s which indicate the
derived forms and where to look for them.","[158, 159, 160]"

"AlagUilacAn i m p o r t a n t q u e s t i o n i s , what was t h e Nahua of t h e Motagua
V a l l e y ( e a s t c e n t r a l Guatemala) l i k e and what i s ""AlagUilac""?
Brinton (1887) i d e n t i f i e d ""AlagUilac"" as a kind of P i p i l , but t h i s
claim i s f a l s e .
In 1576 Palacio (1881-1907) mentioned a language
c a l l e d "" T l a c a c e b a t l e c a "" spoken in "" A c a c e v a s t l a n "" ( c f . M i l e s
1957:739), which i s t a k e n t o be one of t h e modern A c a s a g u a s t l a n
towns of t h e middle Motagua V a l l e y . J u a r r o s (1936(1837):69-71)
indicated t h a t in San C r i s t ó b a l Acasaguastlan the ""AlagUilac"" l a n guage was spoken, while the language of San Agustín Acasaguastlan
was ""Mejicano"" (Mexican, i . e . some variety of Nahua). More d i r e c t
i n f o r m a t i o n was g i v e n i n a r e p o r t by F a t h e r J a c i n t o P o r t i l l o i n
1769:937
La lengua materna de este curato (San Cristóbal
Acasaguastlan) en la cabercera es el chortí, pero que
en los otros poblados y trapiches sólo se habla el
alagUilac (Estrada Monroy 1972:29).
Cf. also, Cortés y Larraz (1958(1771).1:283).
Brinton's evidence for identifying AlagUilac (Palacio's
Tlacacebastleca) as Pipil included a short word list collected by
Bromowicz in 1878 (published in Lehmann 1920:1062-7) and four
manuscript pages dating from 1610 to 1637 written in Nahuatl and
found in the Parrish archives of San Agustin Acasaguastlan. From
these Brlnton concluded that ""Alagüilac was a quite pure form of
the Nahuatl"" (Brinton 1887:376), closely related to the Pipil of
Escuintla (p.377). These data, however, do not warrant such conclusions. The list of words (cf. section 2) was from San Agustin
Acasaguastlan, the town identified in the colonial sources as
""Mexican"" and not AlaglÜlac in speech. Below it will become clear
that this ""Mexican"" indeed owes its origin to people from central
Mexico and has no special connection to Pipil. Futhermore, the
manuscript pages were written in Nahuatl, a central Mexican dialect
of Nahua. Por example, they contain forms with /tl/, which exists
only in dialects originally connected to central Mexico — Pipil
has only /t/, no /tl/. Some cases are:

(cf. CN siwa:tlanke ""he who helps to
bring about marriages"")
(CN ma'tlak-)It should be noted that Lehmann (1920:1061) also rejected Brinton's
identification, pointing to similar examples.
There are at least two possible explanations of how the Mexican
dialect of Nahua registered in the four manuscript pages could come
to be in Acasaguastlan. One has to do with the fact that in New
Spain starting in 1570 the official policy was to make Nahuatl the
general language and no priest who did not know Nahuatl could take
charge of the missions or parishes (Heath 1972:27). This could
explain the Nahuatl fround in Acasaguastlan and in many other
church records of this period from Guatemala and Chiapas in places
where Nahuatl was never the language of the local population. Also938
many Nahuatl speakers were settled in Guatemala on lands given to
the Mexican and Tlaxcalan auxiliaries who helped the Spanish in the
Conquest. For example, of the town of Los Esclavos in Central
Guatemala Ponce (1873(1586)) said:
LLamanse aquellos indios esclavos, porque realmente lo
fueronde l o s españoles e l l o s y otros muchos, recien
conquistada la tierra, quando no estaban las cosas tan
asentadas ni con tan buen orden como agora están, y un
presidente (Alonso López Cerrato) de la Audiencia de
Guatemala lebertó mas de diez mil dellos y los pobló
en diversas partes, y de aquí se quedaron con aquel
nombre, hablan la lengua mexicana corrupta, que se
llama lengua p i p i l (Miles 1957:740).
There were, then, Nahua-speaking Indians settled in various places
in Guatemala, Alvarado's a l l i e s ( c f . Fuentes y Guzman 19323(1695):240). For example, Salamá i s a so-called "" P i p i l "" town; the
sources clearly demonstrate that there was a population there of
Alvarado's ""esclavos p i p i l e s "" ( c f . Pineda 1924-5(1549):347). The
actual i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of Salamá Nahua i s taken up in section 2
below; i t has close a f f i n i t i e s with central Mexico, not with P i p i l .
The so-called "" P i p i l "" of Salamá and of Acasaguastlan are nearly
identical to each other (see section 2), but very distinct from the
P i p i l of El Salvador. Nevertheless, Lehmann was of nearly the same
opinion with respect to the San Agustín Acasaguastlan material
recorded by Bromowlcz as was Brinton, but more circumspect:
Dagegen i s t das Sprachmaterial, das Bromowicz (1878)
in San Agustin gesammelt hat, f a s t einwandsfreies
a l t e r t ü m l i c h e s P i p i l . Es i s t möglich, dass dieses
a l t e Idiom fröher Alagüilac genannt wurde, aber nicht
feststehend (Lehmann 1920:1061).
Here Lehmann erred in believing this to be P i p i l ; i t i s actually in
origin from central Mexico in post-Conquest times, and hence not a
good candidate for AlagUilac.
The post-Conquest o r i g i n from central Mexico of Brinton's and
Bromowicz's data (and of Salamá Nahua) i s secured by the linguistic
facts (section 2). That AlagUilac was something other than these
i s also established by the c o l o n i a l sources. These name as d i s tinct languages in the same context AlagUilac, ""Mejicano"" (Nahua),
and Chorti (or Apay). Since AlagUilac i s c l e a r l y distinguished
from Nahua in these sources, I have raised the possibility that i t939might have been a kind of Xinca, based on the p r e s e n c e of Xinca
p l a c e names i n the nearby a r e a (Campbell 1972, 1978). For more
e x t e n s i v e d i s c u s s i o n of the A l a g U i l a c problem and i t s non-Nahua
i d e n t i t y , see Campbell 1972, Fowler 1981.
2. Salamá and Acasaguastlan Nahua
The reinterpretation of AlagUilac a s something other than P i p i l
r a i s e s another question: how are the Nahua from the Motagua Valley
(San Agustin Acasaguastlan) and Salamá ( j u s t north of the Motagua
in the Salamá Valley) to be interpreted?
Like Lehmann (1920:1061) with h i s p r o b a b l e P i p i l i d e n t i t y f o r
Bromowicz's Motagua material, S t o l l (1958(1884):11) had no h e s i t a tion in declaring Salamá a ""colonia septentrional p i p i l "" . He s a i d :
Comparando l a s voces p i p i l e s de I z a l c o (El S a l v a d o r )
r e c o g i d a s por S c h e r e r , y l a s que de l a c o s t a de
Bálsamo t r a n s c r i b e S q u i e r , con l a s que obtuve en e l
i n t e r i o r de l a república de Guatemala (Salamá), puede
observarse que se diferencian entre s í muy poco ( S t o l l
1958(1884):12).
Q u i t e in c o n t r a s t , I argue t h a t a l l Guatemalan Nahua v a r i e t i e s
(save the P a c i f i c Coast and piedmont — which was true P i p i l ) , are
the r e s u l t s of post-Conquest e v e n t s , due p r i n c i p a l l y t o the
r e s e t t l e m e n t of Nahua s p e a k e r s from e l s e w h e r e , n o n - n a t i v e s of
Guatemala, and t o the use of Nahuatl a s the o f f i c i a l language i n
many church and c i v i l records.
To begin with, there are documents which declare d e f i n i t i v e l y
t h a t the Nahua-speaking p o p u l a t i o n of Salamá i s due to post-Conq u e s t r e s e t t l e m e n t (Pineda 1924-5(1549):347). Also Lehmann c i t e d
an oral t r a d i t i o n that these Nahua speakers were o r i g i n a l l y from
somewhere e l s e :
Nach e i n e r Sage war das Tal von Salamá bald nach der
Conquista Eigentum e i n e r spanischen Dame von T u x t l a
Grande (im S t a a t e Vera C r u z ! ) , d i e e i n e g r o s s e Menge

gebracht haben s o l l . Die i n d i a n s i c h e n Einwanderer
hätten ihre einheimische Tracht von Tuxtla mit sich
gefllrt und erhalten . . . (Lehmann 1920:1062).
Even i f the h i s t o r i c a l sources were to indicate nothing of these
foreign o r i g i n s , evidence which i s purely l i n g u i s t i c i s s u f f i c i e n t940t o show t h a t t h e s e Nahua v a r i e t i e s have no c l o s e r e l a t i o n s h i p t o

"(N-25)In Pipil copular sentences (which typically have 0-copula), the
order is: Subject-Complement, where the subject may be a noun or
an independent pronoun and the complement may be a noun or
adjective. The subject obligatorily precedes the complement. Some
examples are:
1) mu-manuh mas bibo. (A-33)
your-brother more smart.
""Your brother (is) smarter.""
2) yaha albolário. (A-33)
he wizard.
""He (is a) wizard.""
3) ini nu-kuhkul• (S-42)
this ray-bogeyman.
""This (is) my bogeyman.""
4) ke:raan yaha joven ki-kak-tuk. (S-52)
when he young it-hear-PERF.
""When he (was) young (he) had heard it.""
5) ne i-siwa:-w bruhah. (N-24)
the his-wife-POSS witch.
""His wife (was a) witch.""
6) ini ne i-naka-yu tu-kuhkul. (N-118)
this the its-raeat-INT POSS our-bogeyman.
""This (is) the flesh of our bogeyman.""
7) ne mu-te:lpu:ch-tsin kukuya. (R-14)
the your-son-DIMIN sick.
""Your little son (is) sick.""
8) naha ne re:y. (R-51)
I the king.
""I (am) the king.""
The order of modifiers is clear. Adjectives precede the nouns
they modify: Adjective-Noun (Adj.-N). The few instances of N-Adj.
almost all involve adjectives borrowed from Spanish — the Spanish109
order is N-Adj. Adverbs are freer, but they nearly always precede
intransitive and follow transitive verbs:
Adverb-Intransitive Verb (Adv.-i.v.)
Transitive Verb-Adverb (t.v.-Adv.)
For examples of these orders, which are very common, see the texts
of chapter 7.
4.1.1. Word order conclusions. To summarize and complete the
picture, Pipil has the word orders:
(1) i.v.-S (basic)
(2) t.v.-O-S (basic)
(3) V-S-0 (with ""heavy"" objects;object emphasis)
(4) S-V-0 (subject emphasis)
(5) t.v.-S (variant of (2), with object pronominal prefix)
(6) V-0 (variant of (2), with subject pronominal prefix)
(7) Pron.S-V(-O) (basic when subject is an independent
pronoun)
(8) S-0-Complement (basic; subject may be a noun or
independent pronoun, complement may be noun or
adjective)
(9) Noun Phrase (NP): (Dem)(Adj.)N
(Dem = demonstrative)
(for examples, cf. chapter 7, texts)
(10) Verb Phrase (VP): (Adv.) i.v. / t.v. (Adv)(0).
(Cf. chapter 7, texts, for examples.)
4.1.2. Pronominal indirect objects. As indicated in section
3.2.3, pronominal object prefixes function most often to indicate
direct objects, but signal indirect objects as well. In either
case, the verb may bear only one object prefix. In the case of
indirect pronominal objects, there is often an independent noun
phrase direct object or clear contextual clues as to the pronoun's
role with respect to the verb. It may be that the indirect object
function of these pronominal affixes has been influenced by
Spanish, which like English has the same pronominal forms for both
indirect and direct objects in many cases, e.g. mje pegó ""he hit
me"", me di6 el libro ""he gave me the book"". In cases where both
the direct and indirect object are pronominal, it is usually the
indirect object that is marked on the verb, with the direct object
signaled as a full independent pronoun (cf. 3.5.2). One possible
interpretation of this is that animate cases are given priority,
since usually the indirect objects are animate.
Some examples of
pronominal prefixes as markers of indirect objects are:110
1) nech-ahkaw-ilih-ke-t tumin.
me-leave-APPLIC-PRET-PL money.
""They left me (the) money.""
2) ni-yu ni-mitsin-raaka se: pwestoh. (R-54)
I-go I-you pi.-give a position.
""I am going to give you (pl.) a position.""
3) nech-ilwia.
me-tell.
""(She) tells me.""
4) kin-maka-k
pwestoh
ne
prinsipeh
ne
seryuk
pih-pi:pil-raet. (R-56)
them-give-PRET position the prince the other PL-boy-PL.
""The prince gave (to them) the other boys (a) position.
5) ne i-ixwiyu-wan te:-ya su kin-maka ne takwal. (N-83)
the her-grandchild-POSS PL no-now no them-give the food.
""She no longer gives her grandchildren the food.""
6) ki-raaka-ke-t ti:-t ne kal. (N-139)
it-give-PRET-PL fire-ABSOL the house.
""They set the house on fire.""
7) naha propyo ne chu:le-t nech-chiw-tuk kontár. (A-29)
I self the old man-ABSOL me-do-PERF tell.
""(To) me myself the old m a n has told me (it)."" = ""The old
man has told (it to) me myself.""","[122, 123, 124]"
"PossessionPipil has several constructions which express different kinds of
possession.
4.6.1. Pronominal possession. Pronoun possesion is signaled by
prefixes, as seen in sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.4, e.g. nu-pe:lu ""my
dog"", mu-pe:lu ""your dog"", etc.
4.6.2. Nominal possession. When the possessor is an independent noun (and not just a pronoun), the possession construction has
the form: possessive pronominal prefix-Noun^· (Demonstrative)
N o u n 2 , e.g. ""his-dog the man"" for ""the man's dog"". Some examples
are:
1) i-ih-i:x ne siwa:pil
her-PL-eye the girl
""the girl's eyes""
2) ne i-uh-u:mi-yu ne chumpipi
the its-PL-bone-INT POSS the turkey
""the bones of the turkey""
3) i-chan ne ta:ka-t""The man's house""4) i-kwit turuh""cow's excrement""5) i-ihikxi tihlan""chicken's feet""118
6) i-na:n ne bru:hah (N-46)
""the witch's mother""
7) ne i-i:xyu ne tekumat (N-61)
""the bottle gourd's seed(s)""
8) se: i-tapahsul ne wi:lutsin mareño
""a nest of the mareño bird""
Of course, the second noun can also be possessed and appear w i t h
possessive pronominal prefixes, as in, for example, ""my father's
house"", as illustrated in:
9) i-kal nu-te:ku
his-house my-father
""my father's house""
10) ne i-da:muh nu-lama (N-90)
the her-old man my-grandmother
""my grandmother's lover""
11) ne i-naka-yu tu-kuhkul, ne i-da:muh ne in-lama. (N-105)
the
his-meat-INT POSS our-bogeyman, the her lover the
their-grandmother.
""Our bogeyman's flesh, their grandmother's lover"".
4.6.3. Pal periphrastic possessive.
A periphrastic possessive
construction with pal also exists, probably created on analogy with
Spanish ¿e, e.g.:
1) plastas pal turuh (A-22)
plasters of cow
""cowpies""
2) ne ihyak naka-t pal ne masa:-t (N-40)
the stinking meat-ABSOL of the deer
3) i-ih-ikxi ke:n pal henteh (S-39)
her-PL-foot like of people
""her feet (were) like people's""
4.6.4. Piya ""to have"".
Unlike many other Mesoamerican Indian
languages, Pipil has a verb of possession corresponding to English
""to have"". It is illustrated in these sentences:119
1) ni-k-piya se: nu-finkita (N-30)
I-it-have a my-small farm.
""I have a small farm.""
2) ya ki-piya se: i-enamorado (N-81)
She it-have a her-lover.
""She has a lover.""
3) ki-piya se: i-te:lpu:ch-tsin. (R-l)
it-have a his-son-DIMIN.
""He has a small son.""
4) ki-piya ne i-kal-tsin.
it-have the her-house-DIMIN.
""(She) has her little house.""
5) ni-k-pix-(s)kiya tumin, ni-k-kuwa-skiya turuh.
I-it-have-COND money, I-it-buy-COND cow.
""If I had money. I would buy cow(s).""
6) su datka ni-k-piya.
no nothing I-it-have.
""I don't have anything.""
4.6.5. Possessive 'relational noun'. When a possessive pronoun
functions as an independent noun phrase, like ""mine"", ""yours"",
etc., it has the structure of a 'relational noun' with the root
- p a l plus a possessive pronominal prefix. A paradigm of these
forms is:
nu-pal
mu-pal
i-pal
tu-pal
anmu-pal (C)
amu-pal (SD)
im-pal
te:-palmine
yours (sg.)
his/hers/its
ours
yours (pi.)
theirs
someone else's, foreignSome sample sentences with the possessive relational noun are:
1) ini tu-pal""That's ours.""","[131, 132, 133]"
"65
3.7. Verbs
Verbs are the most complex category of Pipil because their
morphology is the most extensive and because they fall into distinct classes defined in part phonologically by changes in their
roots when different tenses and aspects are involved. For that
reason, these tenses and aspects are described first, and then the
verb classes which depend on them are presented.
3.7.1. The order of verbal affixes.
formula:Verbal affixes follow theIntransitive Verb:
pron. subject(+directional)+root+tense/aspect(+number)
Transitive Verb:
pron.subject(+directional)+pron.object+root+tense/asp.(+number)These affixes are described in detail below.
3.7.2. Tense and aspect.
3.7.2.1. Present. The tense traditionally called 'present' in
Pipil covers m o m e n t a n e o u s (e.g. ""I eat (now)""), habitual (""I
(always, characteristically) eat""), and frequently present progressive (""I'm eating"") senses.
It bears no special affixes, although
the root-final vowel is maintained. Transitive verbs very frequently have an - a which signals transitivity, and some transitive
verbs are distinguished from corresponding intransitives solely by
the presence of this -a. The following examples of third person
singular transitive and intransitive forms illustrate this:

in the 'perfect'. The basic form of the 'perfect' is made up of
-tu- 'past participle' plus -lc (probably in origin the 'preterite')
in the singular and
iwi—t in the plural· The —tu— suffix also
occurs in other combinations, e.g.-tu-ya(-t) (cf. section 3.7.6.1)
and -tu-skiya(-t) (cf. section 3.7.2.4.1). The meaning of -tu-k/tiwi-t is 'perfect', both 'present perfect' and 'past perfect',
e.g. ni-k-chiw-tuk ""I have done it"", ""I had done it"". It refers to
past action with present relevance. That is, the 'perfect' refers
to an event in the past which has relation to the present
situation.
Its use in the texts of chapter 7 give the best
indication of its meaning and function.

e.g. the 'conditional' and the 'imperfect'; cf. the next section,
3.7.2.4.1 and section 3.7.6.1.)
3.7.2.4. 'Conditional'.
The conditional suffix is -skiya
'singular' and -skiya-t 'plural'. It is normally attached to the
verb root, which is the same as the 'present' stem — that is, the
stem-final vowel is present. However, the verbs of Class III which
end in -ia and -ua in the 'present', -ih and -uh in the 'preterite'
and 'perfect' attach the suffix to the root without the root-final
vowel and also without the ji, e.g. pulua ""to lose"", ni-k-pulu-skiya
Ί would lose it"" (cf. ni-k-pulua ""I lose it"", ni-k-puluh ""I lost
it"", ni-k-puluh-tuk ""I have lost it""). This suffix is called
'conditional' in the literature; it has the approximate meaning of68
""would"" in English. However, speakers at times tend to translate
these forms with the equivalent of ""want"" or ""would like to"". This
'desiderative' connotation may ultimately be due to Spanish
influence, since it is often translated into Spanish with the
subjunctive and Spanish subjunctives can have both the
'conditional' and the 'desiderative' senses. The 'conditional'
paradigm of panu ""to pass"" is:
ni-panu-skiya
ti-panu-skiya
panu-skiya
t i-panu-skiya-t
am-panu-skiya-t (/an-/)
panu-skiya-tI would pass
you (sg.) would pass
he/she/it would pass
we would pass
you (pi.) would pass
they would pass3.7.2.4.1.
'perfect conditionals'.
There is also a quite
infrequent 'perfect conditional' composed of -tu- 'past participle'
(cf. -tu-k, -tiwi-t) plus -skiya(-t) 'conditional, with the meaning
""would have"", e.g.:
ahsi-tu-skiya
ni-k-taxtah-tu-skiya
yah-tu-skiya
yah-tu-skiya-t
nl-nemi-skiya ni:kan
ke:n ki-chiwa-skiya
ni-kwa-skiya
ni-k-tu:ka-skiya
ni-(k-)kuwa-skiyashe would have arrived
I would have paid it
he would have gone
they would have gone
I would like to be here
How could it be done?
I would like to eat
I would plant it
I would buy it(For conditionals in larger constructions, cf. 4.19.)
3.7.2.5. 'Future'. The future suffixes today in spoken Pipil are
very rare. Usually future meanings are given in periphrastic
constructions, e.g. ni-yu ni-k-chiwa, literally ""I'm going to do
it"". In this, Pipil is very similar to local Spanish, where the
periphrastic forms, e.g. lo voy a hacer (cf. ni-yu ni-k-chiwa) ""I'm
going to do it"" are the most typical, with future forms such as lo
haré (cf. ni-k-chiwa-s) ""I will do it"" rare and stilted. The
Pipil future suffixes are -s^ 'singular' and -s-ke-t 'plural'; they
are similar to the 'conditional' in that normally they are attached
to the verb root ('present' stem) with the final vowel present,
though Class III verbs lack the root-final vowel and the li of other
tenses and aspects, e.g. pulu-ske-t ""they will lose it"" (cf. puluhke-t ""they lost it""). The panu ""to pass"" 'future' paradigm is:69
ni-panu-s
ti-panu-s
panu-s
ti-panu-ske-t
am-panu-ske-t (/an-/)
panu-ske-tI wiii pass
you (sg.) will pass
(he/she/it)will pass
we will pass
you (pi.) will pass
they will passIn Culsnahuat these rare futures are most often found w i t h the
adverbs xa:n ""later, afterwards"" and mu:sta ""tomorrow"", as in:
xa:n ni-k-kwa-s
xa:n ti-k-kwa-s
xa:n ki-kwa-s
xa:n ti-k-kwa-ske-t
xa:n an-ki-kwa-ske-t
xa:n ki-kwa-ske-tlater I will eat it
later you will eat it
later he/she/it will eat it
later we will eat it
later you (pi.) will eat it
later they will eat ittomorrow you will eat tamales
mu:sta ti-k-kwa-s nakatamal
yaha rau:sta ki-kwa-s nakatamal tomorrow he will eat tamales
tomorrow you will go
mu:sta ti-ya-s
tomorrow he will go
mu:sta ya-s3.7.2.6. 'Desiderative 1 . Pipil has a 'desiderative' composed
of 'future' - s plus neki, historically from the verb root ""to
want"". It has the form: pronouns+verb+s+neki(+plural).
The construction means ""to want to do the action expressed by the verb"".
Some examples are:
naha ni-k-kwa-s-neki
taha ti-k-kwa-s-neki
yaha ki-kwa-s-neki
tehemet ti-k-kwa-s-neki-t
an-ehemet an-ki-kwa-s-neki-t
yehemet ki-kwa-s-neki-tI want to eat it
you (sg.) want to eat it
he/she wants to eat it
we want to eat it
you (pi.) want to eat it
they want to eat it3.7.2.7. 'Imperfect'.
The suffix - y a 'imperfect' indicates
continuous past actions, best translated into English as ""used to
do"" or ""was doing"" the action of the verb. It is equivalent to the
Spanish 'imperfect past' which ends in - i a or - a b a , e.g. c o m i a
""(she) was eating"", c a m i n a b a ""(he) used to walk"". It is employed
rather seldom in present-day Pipil. Some examples are:70
ni-tawi:kilia-ya
ki-na:maka-yaI owed (him money for some time)
he used to sell/was selling it3.7.2.7.1. -tu-ya 'past imperfect'.
The suffix -tu-ya is
exceedingly rare in today's usage. It is composed of the 'past
participle' -tu- (cf. -tu-k, -tiwi-t, section 3.7.2.3) plus the
'imperfect' -ya. It essentially means an action which continued in
the past but is now ended, e.g.:
ni-k-ltskih-tu-ya
ni-k-chiw-tu-ya
ti-k-chiw-tu-yaI had been grabbing it
I had been doing it
we used to be doing itIt should be noted that the 'imperfect' is distinct from the clitic
-a/-ya ""already, now"", and should not be confused with it (cf.
section 3.8.1).
With this information about tenses and aspects we can now turn
to a description of the verb classes. Once the verb classes are
clear, we can return to a characterization of the rest of the verb
morphology, including additional details about tense and aspect.
3.7.3. Verb classes
It is almost possible to define the verb classes totally by
reference to their phonological form (cf. section 2.2), but this is
complicated by some exceptions and by certain verbs whose form
varies. Therefore, verb classes are defined here, and the dictionary entries (chapter 5) indicate them by presenting verb tenses
and aspects which show their phonological form in each case. This
is important information, since the phonological shape is frequently not predictable. It will be noticed, that the description
of Pipil verb classes is roughly equivalent to that presented for
Classical Nahuatl by Andrews (1975).
3.7.3.1. Class I ((C)VCV) verbs. Class I verbs typically lose
their root-final vowel in the 'preterite' and 'perfect'. Some lose
the vowel only in the 'perfect' and not in the 'preterite' (cf. the
vowel-loss rules, section 2.2). Class I verbs are characteristically of the shape (C)VCV, but do not include the (C)Vka or (C)VCu
forms of Class II. Loss of the root-final vowel in these verbs
creates no consonant clusters of more than two members. The
'preterite' with this class is normally -ki or
except in the
case of certain intransitive verbs which keep the root vowel in the71'preterite' but lose it in the 'perfect'.

The next
largest group is Class II. These verbs do not lose their rootfinal vowel in the 'preterite' or the 'perfect'. The majority are
characterized by the phonological shapes: (C)VCCV, (C)Vka, and72
(C)VCu — the shapes that resist vowel-loss either because otherwise impermissible consonant clusters would arise, or because -ka
and -τι are not subject to the rule (cf. section 2.2). Nevertheless, there are some verbs of this class which have none of these
phonological patterns, but fail to undergo vowel loss. The form of
the 'preterite' of Class II verbs is -Jc in the singular (all
classes have -ke-t in the plural). Some examples are:

-ia or -ua in the 'present'; in the 'preterite' and 'perfect' their
roots end in -ih and -uh; and in the 'conditional' and 'future'
forms their roots end in plain -i_ and -u. Phonetically in the
'present' these are (-iya) and (-uwa) and are not phonetically
distinct from verbs with underlying /-iya/ (and /-uwa/). They
are morphophonemically distinct, however, given that these latter
are either -iya-k or -ix(-k) in the 'preterite'. Historically it
is probable that Pre-Proto-Nahua had an intervocalic li which was
lost in Class III verbs (i.e. -iha, -uha) in their present stems.
This accounts for why ji is present in the 'preterite' and 'perfect'
forms of this class; the ti was not intervocalic here and hence was
not lost. We might further postulate that this historical Ji was
lost in the 'conditionals' and 'futures' of this class because it
would have otherwise created a consonant cluster of more than two
members (e.g. -iK-skiya, -uK-s-ke-t) or two consonants at the end73of a word (e.g. - i K - s 'singular future 1 ). Also, historically the
verbs with a short vowel before w plus a_ (i.e. -Vwa) changed ultimate to - u a (cf. Canger 1980). This change is evident in Pipil
reflexes as in the pairs of verbs where the transitive has -ua and
the corresponding intransitive has -Vwi. e.g.:
ihtakawi
kwe:chiwi
kwe:liwito break down
for corn to be
insect-eaten
to curve, bendihtakua
kwe:chuato take apart, ruin
to grind finelykwe:luato bend (something)Thus it seems that historical - V w a became -uha and later the li
was lost intervocalically, giving -ua, but preserved finally and
before a single consonant. This is a reflex of the Pre-Proto-Nahua
change of syllable-final w to h (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978).

These were presented in section 3.2). Here
we turn to the other pronominal a f f i x e s that occur with verbs.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"
"4.2. ""Tobe""While n e m i is the basic verb ""to be"", Pipil has a variety of
constructions which express the notions of ""to be"". Some of these
have already been considered, others are presented here.
4.2.1. Pronominal copula. Equational constructions in which the
subject is a pronoun were considered in section 3.2.2.1. They are
formed by prefixing a subject pronoun normally found on verbs to
the complement, e.g. ni-ta:ka-t ""I am a man"".
(Cf. section 3.2.2.1 for examples and details.)Ill
4.2.2. ¿ - c o p u l a . The equational copular construction has no
verb; the subject typically is a noun phrase, noun, or occasionally
an independent pronoun, while the c o m p l e m e n t is a noun phrase,
noun, adjective, or independent pronoun.
Some examples were
already seen (see 4.1.5.). A few others are:
(1) ne sipiti:yuh chikitik-chin,
ma: tumak ne i-xumpe.
(Sip-2)
the sipitillo small-DIMIN but large the his-hat.
""The Sipitillo (is) little, but his hat (is) very big.""
(2) ne tsuntekuma-t chikitik, pero tumak i-tsuntekun. (SD)
the skull-ABSOL small but big his-head.
""The ""Skull""
small, but his head (is) very large.
4.2.3. Locational nemi. For ""to be somewhere, in some place"",
the verb nemi is used with locatives, as for example:
1) ki-mat-ki ka:n nemi ne i-siwa:pil-tsin. (N-48)
it-know-PRET where is the her-girl-DIMIN.
""(She) knew where her little girl was.""
2) pero ni:kan nemi ne nu-chi:chiwal. (N-50)
but here is the my gourd.
""But here is my gourd.""
3) ne: nemi ne xu:re-tsin. (R-10)
there is the old man-DIMIN.
""There is the little old man.""
4) ni:kan nerai-t ne 1-amigitus. (R-44)
here is-PL the his-little friends.
""Here are his little friends.""
5) ni-k-mati ka:n nemi nu-te:ku, ka:n neminu-na:n. (A-4)
I-it-know where is my-father, where is my-mother.
""I know where my father is, where my mother is.""
6) i-na:n wan i-te:ku ne: tik arkuh nemi-t. (A-2)
his-mother and his-father there in arch is-PL.
""His mother and his father are there in (the) arch.""
4.2.4. 'Existential' nemi.
The verb n e m i is also used to
express ""there is"", ""there are"", ""exists"". It functions very much
like Spanish hay, ""there is/are"", including sometimes its singular112
form with plural nouns.","[124, 125, 126]"
"Chapter 3
Grammatical Categories and Morphology3.0. Introduction
In this chapter the grammatical categories, or parts of speech,
and their morphology are described. In some ways these aspects of
P i p i l are prerequisites to an understanding of the syntactic constructions considered in the next chapter. Both t h i s chapter and
the next in general follow Langacker's (1977) order of presentation.
3.1. Nouns. P i p i l nouns are found as simple noun r o o t s , as
compounds composed of two or more roots, or as derived forms from
other c a t e g o r i e s , e.g. from verbs by means of nominalizing s u f fixes. This section i s dedicated to a description of the morphology of nouns.
3.1.1. Absolutives. In P i p i l a s u f f i x c a l l e d the ' a b s o l u t i v e '
occurs with most noun roots when these appear without other a f fixes. Thus, for example, the 'absolutive' occurs with otherwise
bare nouns, as in s i w a ; - t ""woman"", where -_t i s the ' a b s o l u t i v e '
s u f f i x , but not with the noun root when i t occurs in composition
with
another element, e.g. nu-siwa:w
""my
wife"", siwa:-pil
"" g i r l "" , siwa:-pah ""ciguapate (a medicinal plant, l i t e r a l l y 'womanmedicine')""; ulu-t ""corncob"", nu-ulu ""my corncob""; etc.
The absolutive has several alloraorphs. These are:
(1)with noun roots which end ina vowel, e.g.:a:ka-t

kwix-ti(3) -in: is a non-productive and somewhat rare allomorph which
occurs principally with terms for small animals and a few other
nouns, hence it is occasionally called the ""varmint"" class. This
allomorph, however, is not lost when the noun occurs with a
prefix, e.g. nu-mich-in ""my fish"", but it is absent from compounds:
chapulin ""grasshopper""
kapulin
tu:linchapul-ehtapal ""chapulaltapa""
(""grassphopper-wing tree"")
""chokecherry""
kapul-a:ma-t ""capulamate"" (tree)

With a few roots the a b s o l u t i v e s u f f i x i s not dropped when
possessive pronominal prefixes are present. These examples are:
-a:pan-ti
-a:wa-t
-chankwita-t
-kal-tsun-ti
-tuch-ti
-i(t)sti-tirrigated f i e l d
bud
corn candy
beam, roof pole
rabbit
(finger)nailThese are a l l exceptional in not dropping the a b s o l u t i v e under
possession. In some cases i t may be assumed that the old absolut i v e has become frozen a s part of the r o o t , e.g. - a : p a n t i ; o t h e r s
may be influenced by the f a c t that local Spanish has borrowed the
Pipil form with some indication of the absolutive in the borrowed
form, which in turn may have come to i n f l u e n c e the native P i p i l
form to maintain a root more similar to the Spanish version, e.g.
-awa-t i s in Spanish ""aguate"", -kal-tsun-ti i s ""caisonte"".
There are also two exceptions with - t i a f t e r a root-final -JL:
(SD) a h s i : l - t i
""nit
(louse
egg)""
(but
(C) a h s i : l )
and
a : w i l - t i ""toy"" (in both d i a l e c t s ) . However, in the l a t t e r word,
the - t i i s not dropped when i t occurs with p o s s e s s i v e pronominal
prefixes, and for that reason i t i s perhaps better to consider the
- t i to be frozen as part of the root i t s e l f .

carry the absolutive suffix, as noted above, but in certain circumstances it takes a possessive suffix. That is, noun roots w h i c h
end in -a, -e, or -i. generally take the suffix -w; those which have
root-final -ji or a consonant do not have it. This is illustrated
in the following examples; the hyphen (-) indicates that the noun
bears s o m e prefix, in this case one of the possessive pronominal
prefixes which co-occur with the possessive suffix -w:

orange (Spanish loanword)There is also another possessive suffix, -yu. w h i c h m e a n s
'intimate (sometimes called 'inalienable') possession'. Forms with
this suffix are inherently more closely connected to, or ""intimate""
with the possessor, often an inalienable part thereof. It is best
understood by seeing it in contrast with the
possessive suffix
which suggests no particularly close association between the noun
and its possessor. Compare, then, for example, nu-naka-w ""my meat""
(to eat, but not part of my body) with nu-naka-yu ""my flesh"" (i.e.
meat that is part of my body); i-u:mi-w ""his bone"" (for chewing,
not part of his body) with i-u:mi-yu ""his bone"" (in his body).
Some examples of 'intimate possession' with the -yu suffix are:

featherThe forms showing intimate possession with -yu generally are body
parts, plant parts, parts of animals, or other things c l o s e l y
associated with the possessor. I t is worth noting that so-called
""inalienable"" possession i s a f e a t u r e common to a l l Mesoamerican
Indian languages, as w e l l as many others outside t h i s l i n g u i s t i c
area. The label ""inalienable"" i s generally employed in reference
to a class of nouns which typically do not occur without possessive
a f f i x e s . These nouns c h a r a c t e r i s t i c a l l y belong to the semantic
classes of body parts (hence the name "" i n a l i e n a b l e "" ) and kinship
terms ( i n t i m a t e l y associated with the possessor, but not so
inalienable). P i p i l , of course, conforms to this pattern.
3.1.2.1. Plural possession.
Some plural forms take the s u f f i x
-wan, the plural of -w, when they are possessed. A few cases are:
-manuh-wan
-miyak-wan
-mu:n-wan
-pila-wan
- p i : pi-wan
-sih-siwa:-wan
-te:lpu:ch-wanbrothers

wives, women
sonsThis s u f f i x r e f l e c t s ' i n t i m a t e ' ( i n a l i e n a b l e ) possession, given
that i t occurs only with kinship or closely related terms.
The plural of some possessed forms i s expressed by reduplicating
the possessive pronominal p r e f i x , e.g. nuh-nu-chi;l ""my c h i l i
peppers"" (see section 3.1.4 f o r details).
For larger possessive constructions, see section 4.7 ( c f . also,
section 3.2.4).

3.5. Locatives
Pipil locatives include independent prepositions and 'relational
nouns'.
3.5.1. Independent prepositions. The prepositions which occur
without additional morphology to indicate the location of the headnoun of the prepositional phrase are:
ka
katani
pak
pak kal
pak me:sah
pal
tik
ti:pan
wan
chanin, at, to
below, under (ka-tani)
on, upon, over, on top of

junto + -ti-k 'adj.')3.5.2. Relational nouns. Locatives called 'relational nouns' by
Mesoamerican linguists bear possessive pronominal prefixes on what
is in origin and still in form a noun root; that is, these locatives look like possessed nouns. This trait is found in nearly all60
the Indian languages of Mesoamerica. The constructions are illustrated here in the paradigms for - w a n ""with"" and (i)hpak ""on"":

-tan -kupa under, beneath, below
-tan

A few locatives are composed of a free preposition and a relational
noun (with the appropriate possessive prefixes):
ka
ka-ihtik inside (cf. ihtik)
-ipan behind
ka nu-ipan behind me
ka -chan at (someone's house)
ka nu-chan at my place, at my house3.5.3. Frozen locatives. In a few cases some of these locatives
have been frozen in compounds with a meaning not obvious from the
sum of the parts:61ka-ik-ahku

"P i p i l has threekinds of inchoatives,3.7.8.3.1. ' I n c h o a t i v e s ' with -ua/-wi/-wa.
The ' i n c h o a t i v e '
suffixes are related to the causatives in that, while the intransit i v e forms have 'inchoative' meaning (""to become what i s signified
in the r o o t "" ) , the t r a n s i t i v e s have a causative meaning, e.g.
k w e : l i w i ( i . v . ) ""to curve"" ( c f . k w e : l - ""curved,
bent""); ku:sua
( t . v . ) "" t o bead, i n s e r t "" ( c f . ku:s- ""bead""). Many of these are
inchoatives of ' s i z e ' or 'shape' ( i n c h o a t i v e s of 'sensations' are
considered later). The transitive counterpart, -ua, has sometimes
been c a l l e d a ' p a s s i v e ' , but i t s function i s more accurately described as 'impersonal', a means of employing a t r a n s i t i v e verb
without s p e c i f y i n g i t s subject, translated into English as, f o r

(See section 3.6.3.)
3.7.8.3.2. 'Inchoatives' of ""perception"" or ""sensation"" (-va).
Another kind of inchoative verb bears the suffix -ya. which derives
intransitive inchoatives from adjective roots which typically mean
something having to do with ""sensations"" or ""perceptions"". Some
examples are:
chichi:ltiya
chichiyato redden (chi:l-tik ""red"")

to become sweet (tsupe:le-k ""sweet"")
to become bland (yama:ni-k ""bland"")
to improve, get fixed (ye:k ""good"")3.7.8.3.3. -ti ""to become"". The final kind of inchoative takes
the suffix -ti which is not productive, but which derives inchoative verbs from some noun roots. The examples are:
ta:ka-ti
kukua-wits-ti
teki-tito grow up (ta:ka-t ""man"")
to prick (kuku(a) ""pain"" + wits- ""thorn"")
to work (teki-t ""work"")For a detailed discussion of inchoative verbs in Nahua generally,
cf. Canger 1980.
3.7.8.4. 'Passives' (-1_, - l u , - l w - , and -ua). Although these
passive suffixes are no longer productive, Pipil has many passive
verbs of this kind derived from actives. The most common type has
-lu. From this comes the
suffix which derives nouns from passive verbs (e.g. ta-kwa-1 ""food"", ta- 'something' + k w a ""to eat"" +
— ' p a s s i v e nominalization'; literally ""something that is eaten"";
cf. section 3.1.3.10). The - u a class of passive verbs is smaller.
W i t h this suffix, preceding ¿ and Jts are palatalized to x_ and £ h
respectively (cf. section 2.2). Verbs derived from others with

to squat (cf. tsukul ""lump"")
to roll (cf. ulul-nah ""round"")3.7.8.5. 'Applicatives' (-lia (and -iltia)). In Nahua studies,
'applicative' is the traditional name for the suffix w h i c h indicates that the verb permits three arguments, subject, direct o b ject, and indirect object, with the meaning ""someone (subject) does
(verb) something (direct object) for or against someone (indirect
object, 'applicative' suffix). The basic form of the 'applicative'
suffix is -lia, but like the passive, this, too, historically
contained an i. which sometimes causes the root vowel to change to i
and palatalizes /s/ and /ts/ to /x/ and /ch/, respectively. S o m e
examples are:
kuwilia
kwepiliato buy for (kuwa ""to buy"")
to return something to someone (kwepa
""to return"")
pahpa:kilia
to laugh at (pa:ki ""to laugh"")
tapatilia
to change something for someone (pati
""to change"")
to undress someone (mu-petstia ""to undress"")
petstilia
to sing for (takwi:ka ""to sing"")
takwi:kalia
mu-tate:muwilia to look for something for someone
te:mua ""to look for"")
to pile on for (tepe:wa ""to pile"")
tepe:wilia
to tie tight on (tete-k ""tight"")
tetilia91
tsahtsalia
wi:kiliato shout to, to call someone something
(tsahtsi ""to shout"")
to owe someone something (wi:ka ""to take"")A variant form of the 'applicative', -ltia. occurs with a few
verbs; -lwia in one case:
takwiltia
tane:wiltia
takwi:kalwiato loan someone something (takwi ""to borrow"")
to lend (tane:wi ""to borrow"")
to sing something for someone (takwi:ka
""to sing"")3.7.8.6. 'Diffusion* verbs (-ni/-na/-nia). The verbs with the
suffixes -ni (intransitive) and -nia/-na (transitive) have a common
semantic trait, although it is difficult to specify that feature
clearly. Many of these verbs refer to sounds, others to breaking
or tearing, and still others to the extension or diffusion of
something. Perhaps it is not wholly felicitous to call these all
'diffusion' verbs, but if w e stretch the notion of diffusion is
stretched to include sounds (which, of course, do diffuse), and if
then breaking and tearing are further placed among the verbs of
sound (given that sound is produced in such actions), perhaps we
can speak of 'diffusion' verbs without misinterpretation. Examples
of these are:
ahka:na
to blow, fan pusu: ni

""instrumental prefixes"", but much less extensively than some other
Uto-Aztecan languages. The instrumental prefix is basically an
incorporated noun, usually a body-part term, w h i c h semantically
signals the instrument by which the action of the verb is realized.
These have been called instrumental prefixes because in some languages the incorporated elements appear in a changed, abbreviated
form s o m e w h a t different from the full nouns from w h i c h they are
derived. (Pipil also has such changed forms, but with incorporated
objects, rather than these instrumental f o r m s (see below).) The
few examples appear to be frozen; they are:
1) tan-kwa
2) mu-tankwa-ketsa
3) ikxi-ahsi
4) kwa:ch-ki:xtia
5) te-tsikwini
6) mu-tu:nal-tatiato bite (tan- ""tooth"", kwa ""to eat"")
to kneel (tankwa ('knee'), ketsa
""to stand"")
to reach, catch up with (ikxi
""foot"", ahsi to ""arrive, find"")
to strain, sift (kwa:ch- ""cloth"",
ki:xtia ""to take out"")
to cross the river on rocks (te""rock"", tsikwini ""to jump"")
to sun (tu:nal ""sun"", tatia ""to burn"")97
3.7.10.3. Object incorporation. Like other Uto-Aztecan and many
native American languages, Nahua varieties can incorporate an object noun directly into the verb. Such incorporated objects have a
generic or non-specific sense. English does not really have this
kind of incorporation, but examples such as ¿o proofread (read
proof), to babysit (sit babies), to deerhunt(?) (hunt deer), and to
barhop (hop bars) give a good idea of the construction. In Pipil
it is no longer productive and most of the forms are frozen; for
that reason, some examples were included in the section on verb
compounds (cf. 4.6.2). The most common are the cases with a bodypart term incorporated. Cases in which the incorporated element
occurs in a special form different from its independent nominal
counterpart are signaled by single quotes ('...') which otherwise
are employed to mark grammatical elements as opposed to lexical
material (marked with double quotes (""..."")).
Some examples with regular incorporated nouns are:

Syntax4.0. Introduction
This description of P i p i l syntax i s not intended as an examination of the minor syntactic details nor of the profoundly complicated formal questions that so fascinate many modern grammarians.
I t s goal i s , rather, to provide basic information concerning the
structure of sentences and the function of certain syntactic categ o r i e s , and compounds. The t o p i c s considered and t h e i r order of
presentation follow Langacker (1977), except that more morphological topics were covered in the last chapter. Many of the examples
are taken from the t e x t s of chapter 7; these are marked with a
l e t t e r and number code, the l e t t e r to i n d i c a t e the text and the
number for the line within i t ( f o r details, see chapter 7).","[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115]"

2) The p r o n u n c i a t i o n of k v a r i e s depending on the d i a l e c t ( c f .
section 1.4).
In Cuisnahuat, i t i s pronounced & or χ between two
ja's or between vowels where the f i r s t i s long; in other contexts i t
i s normally k, e x c e p t f o r i n i t i a l k. of the ' t h i r d person s g .
pronominal' p r e f i x in many c a s e s . In Santo Domingo de Guzman i t i s
pronounced ¿ i n i t i a l l y and i n t e r v o c a l i c a l l y , while i t i s k in other
contexts. Since the conditions f o r these allophones are r e l a t i v e l y
complicated, occasionally in the dictionary and in one sample text
from each d i a l e c t (H and N) the phonetic t r a n s c r i p t i o n i s
presented together with the regular (phonemic) form.
3) The ji i s pronounced j u s t a s i n l o c a l S p a n i s h , a s n, s a v e
word-finally and preconsonantally where i t i s pronounced a s a velar
nasal (jj). With some frequency t h i s _n i s phonetically velar a l s o
before _t, s , t s , ch, and x_> where i t a l t e r n a t e s with n. In c e r t a i n

( 1 ) Vowel l o s s r u l e s . In P i p i l a vowel may be l o s t i n s e v e r a l
contexts, as follows.
(1.1) Vowel l o s s in verbs. P i p i l has four c l a s s e s of verbs (see
s e c t i o n 3 . 7 . 3 . ) . In the f i r s t , which i s t h e l a r g e s t c l a s s ,
the
f i n a l vowel of the r o o t i s l o s t with most s u f f i x e s , save t h e

n i - k - c h i w - k i "" I did i t "" ,
n i - k - c h i w - t u k "" I have done i t "" ) . For t h e most p a r t verb c l a s s e s
can be c h a r a c t e r i z e d by t h e i r p h o n o l o g i c a l a t t r i b u t e s , although
t h e r e i s a r e a s o n a b l y l a r g e number of verbs which do not conform29
completely, given t h e i r phonological form. Nevertheless, most
class I verbs are of the form (C)VCV, i.e. of two syllables with no
internal consonant cluster. This class loses i t s root-final vowel
in many contexts to be discussed presently. Class I I i s also a
l a r g e c l a s s whose members a r e t y p i c a l l y
characterized
phonologlcally by the forms (C)VCCV, (C)Vka. or (C)VCu; that i s ,
they have a consonant cluster before the f i n a l vowel or end in
-ka or —u. Class I I verbs typically do not lose their f i n a l vowel
in the vowel-loss rule. S t i l l , there are a few (C)Vka forms which
do drop the - a , j u s t as there are a few (C)VCV ( c l a s s I ) verbs
which do not lose the l a s t root vowel. Thus, we formulate the
following rule:
Rule l a ) Vowel loss in verbs: the f i n a l vowel
of verb roots i s generally lost in f i n a l postion or before a s u f f i x which begins with
v o i c e l e s s consonant in (C)VCV forms, but not
in (C)VCCV. (C)Vka. or (C)VCu forms.
Some indications of how this rule works are the following.
a) The root—final vowel i s maintained a f t e r a consonant cluster:
- a h s i - k ""(he) a r r i v e d "" , -chihcha-k ""(he) spat"", - i x k a - k ""(he)
roasted ( i t ) "" , uksi-k ""cooked"", etc.
b) The root-final vowel i s maintained when the verbal root ends
in -ka: -chu:ka-k ""(he) cried"", -maka-k ""(he) gave"", -tu:ka-k
"" ( h e ) planted"", -wika-k ""(he) carried ( i t ) "" , e t c .
c) The f i n a l vowel of the verb root i s preserved because i t ends
in -u: panu-k "" ( i t ) passed"", -temu-k ""(he) descended"", -ehku-k.
etc.
d) The rule a p p l i e s and here the f i n a l vowel i s l o s t (the
'present' being compared with 'past' forms): a:na. - a n - k i ""(he)
grabbed ( i t ) "" ; - c h i v a , - c h i x - k i ""(she) looked"",
-kaki.
-kak
""(she) heard ( i t ) "" ;
-nemi. nen-ki "" ( i t ) was""; k i : s a , k i : s - k i
""(she) l e f t "" ; e t c .
(1.2) Vowel loss in nouns. A rule very s i m i l a r to the vowelloss rule in verbs also applies to nouns, except that the f i n a l -u
of nouns may also be dropped and the loss of a of noun roots ending
in -ka i s v a r i a b l e with respect to loss. This i s indeed a phonologically conditioned rule, though i t s application i s most easily
perceived in certain grammatical contexts, for example in nominal
forms bearing a possessive prefix where the absolutive s u f f i x i s
not present so that the end of the noun root i s bare (see section
3.1.1.), leaving r o o t - f i n a l vowels in w o r d - f i n a l p o s i t i o n .
Its
application i s also noted in compound words (see section 4.7). The
rule, then i s :30
Rule lb) Vowel loss in nouns: a root-final vowel of a
noun (i, e, a^ and sometimes u) is lost before voiceless
consonants of suffixes or in nominal compounds if the
loss would not result in a monosyllabic form, or in a
consonant cluster of two members word-finally, or in a
cluster of more than two consonants word-internally.
Some examples of this rule's application, in which nouns with
the absolutive suffix compared with other forms, are:
atimi-t,
nu-atin ""my louse""; chikiwi-t. nu-chikiw ""my basket""; kakawa-t.
nu-kakaw ""my cacao""; kaxi-t, nu-kax ""my bowl""; kuyame-t. nu-kuyan
""my pig""; kwita-t, nu-kwit ""my excrement""; peta-t, nu-pet ""my
mat""; tekuma-t, nu-tekun ""my bottle gourd""; ikx-u:miyu ""shin"" (from
ikxi- ""foot"" + u:mi-yu ""bone""); ku:n-ti:l ""soot"" (from ku:mi""pot"" + ti:l
""soot (black))""; kuyan=iswa-t ""cuyanigua (a wild
root like a sweet potato)"" (from kuyame- ""pig"" + iswa-t ""leaf"");
etc.
(1.3) Vowel loss in suffixes. This same rule applies to suffixes, as well. For example, the absolutive suffix has two main
allomorphs, -ti with nouns that end in a consonant, and
with
those which terminate in a vowel (see secation 3.1.1). With -ti as
the underlying (basic) form of this suffix, the - ¿ i s lost if no
consonant clusters result.
For example, underlying /a:ka-ti/
""reed"" becomes a:ka-t (recall that the root-final -a is not lost
when it is protected by the lc (see above)), while in /es-ti/
""blood"" the
of the absolutive -ti is maintained since that its
loss would otherwise result in a final consonant cluster and also
in a monosyllabic form. Some examples both with -C-ti and with -V-t
are:
kak-ti ""sandal"", pah-ti ""medicine"", tix-ti ""corn dough"",
sin-ti ""maize"", me:ts-ti ""moon""; a:waka-t ""avocado"", a:chiyu-t
""bixa (achiote)"", a:-t ""water"", e:-t ""bean"", e:lu-t ""roasting ear
(ear of corn)"", ku:ska-t ""necklace"", kwawi-t ""tree""; etc.
Similarly, the 'preterite (past tense)' suffix has two allomorphs, -ki after consonants and -lc after vowels. (It also has the
variant
in some cases, but that is not relevant to this rule (see
section 3.3.2.).) With /-ki/ as the underlying (basic) form, the
vowel-loss rule eliminates the
if no consonant clusters arise.
For example, compare -maka-k ""(he) gave (it)"", where the -a of the
verb root is protected from loss by the lc and where the final -i of
the suffix is lost, with -chiw-ki ""(he) did (it)"", where the-root
final vowel was lost which created a consonant cluster which in
turn prevented the final vowel of the 'preterite' suffix from loss
(for more examples, see section 3.3.2.).","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"Other nominal suffixes.3.1.3.1.
-pan. The l o c a t i v e s u f f i x -pan ""on, upon, near""

3.1.3.2. -tan. The locative suffix - t a n means approximately
""in, among, under, near, next to"". Historically it is closely
connected with -tani ""under, beneath, below"". It is also not
productive. Some examples are:
ka:ka:lu:-tanSan Julián

from the root ta:l ""land"": its basic meaning seems to be ""place of
many"" of the things named by the noun root to which it is attached.
It corresponds to the Spanish suffix -al. -ar (e.g. platanal
""plantain grove"" (cf. plátano ""plantain""), piñal ""pine grove"" (cf.
pino ""pine""), frijolar ""bean patch"" (cf. frijol ""bean""), carrizal
""canebrake"" (cf. carrizo ""cane, reed""), cafetal ""coffee orchard"",
etc. It is possible that the meaning and perhaps even the origin
of this suffix has been influence by this Spanish case, given that
other Nahua varieties are not known to have such an ending. Forms
with this suffix are:
a:ka-tal
canebrake, place of reeds
a:ma-tal
many amate trees/paper
e:-tal
bean patch, bean field
saka-tal
pasture
te-tá:l,
rocky place

(te- ""stone"")
(tew-ti ""dust"")
(uku- ""pine"",
cf. Sp. ocotal)
(u:wa- ""cane"", Sp.
huatal)
(wa(:)ki ""dry"")3.1.3.5. -ka. Pipil has some nouns which are derived from
verbs or adjectives by means of the suffix -ka. In other varieties
of Nahua this suffix, in addition to being a nominalizer, is related to the 'perfect' and the 'remote past'. Nevertheless, Pipil
has no 'remote past' and its 'perfect' forms do not include -ka.
Noun roots that take this suffix undergo vowel-loss (see section
2.2, rule 1). The following show it:
cha:mah-ka
i:xpil-ka
mulin-ka
-pat-ka
pepetska
pu:pu:l-ka
tuhtuk-ka
tumah-ka
tsah-ka
yaman-kawaist
squatting

silver fish
dregs
brooding hen
fat (n.)
lid
lukewarm(cha:mawak ""thick"")
(i:xpilua ""to sqat"")
(mulu:ni ""to puff up"")
(pata ""to change"")
(cf. pets-tik ""smooth"")
(pu:su:l ""posol"")
(tu:ka ""to bury"" (?))
(tuma:wak ""fat"" (Adj.))
(tsakwa ""to close"")
(yama:nik ""bland"")49
Another very restricted suffix, which appears to be related to
this -ka. is the locative ending -kan. The few examples are:
ta-we:y-kan
ta-ne:s-kan
yeh-kancountry(side) (cf. we:y ""big"")
dawn, clearing (cf. ne:si ""to appear"")
alone, to the right (ye:k ""good"" (?))3.1.3.6. -ni. The 'agentive' suffix -ni derives nouns from
verbs with the meaning of ""one who does the action of the verb"".
Some examples are:
atsakwa-ni
ehku-niazacuan birdladino,
foreigner
kuchi-ni
sleepy-head
sick person
kukuya-ni
ma:wiltiaya-ni playful person
dead person
miki-ni

(ta-pa:ka- ""to wash"")
(ta-tu:ka- ""to plant"")
(ta-tsa:wa- ""to weave"")3.1.3.7. -s. (-lis, - w i s , -was). The -s, suffix also derives
nouns from verbs, nouns which reflect the activity of the verb. It
is no longer productive, and Pipil has few examples:

drum
(cf. pu:ni ""to burst"" ?)
comb
(tsikwastia ""to comb"")

((u)chpa:na ""to sweep"")3.1.3.8. -tsin. The suffix -tsin is productive and has a
'diminutive' or 'reverential' function.
In some words this suffix
bears the stress even though it may not be the penultimate
syllable. Also, it is pronounced at times as -chin instead of the50
expected
-tsin.
In plural
forms it Is
reduplicated,
tsintsin in many of the dialects, but -tsitsin in Cuisnahuat. Some
examples are:

are:

4.14. Relative clauses. Relative clauses in Pipil are similar
in function to those of Spanish and are normally introduced by ne
'relative pronoun', ke (a borrowing of the Spanish relative marker
jjue), and at times ka(h) ""who, what"". In what follows examples are
presented in which the relativized noun phrase (signaled by the
relative marker) functions first as the logical subject of the
relative clause, followed by examples as the logical object.","[141, 142]"

see C a m p b e l l and Langacker 1978, Canger 1980, Lastra de Suárez
1975, and Sullivan 1980. The least controversial classification of
Uto-Aztecan has eight branches or subgroups:
UTO-AZTECAN
I. Numic (Plateau Shoshone)
1. Mono (Monachi), Paviotso
2. Panamint, Shoshone
3. Kawaaisu, Ute
II. TUbatulabal (Kern River)
III. Takic (Southern California Soshone)
1. Serrano, +Kitanemuk, +Vanyume, +Alliklik
2. +Fernandeño, +Gabrieleño, +Nicoleño
3. Cahuilla, Luiseño, Cupeño, +Juaneño
IV. Hopi
V. Piman
1. Pima, Papago
2. Northern Tepehuan, Southern Tepehuan
VI. Taracahitic
1. Tarahumara
2. Cahita, Varihio (Guarihio)
3. Opata
VII. Cora-Huichol (Corachol)
1. Cora
2. Huichol
VIII. Nahua (Aztecan, Nahuatlan)
1. +Pochutec
2. Pipil
3. Core Nahua (all other Nahua varieties)
Note: + = extinct.
Many proposals exist for higher-order, more inclusive groupings,
and there is now a near consensus that the family first split into
two branches, Northern Uto-Aztecan (which includes groups I-IV
here) and Southern Uto-Aztecan (groups V-VIII). More controversial
proposals have bunched Takic, Numic, and TUbatulabal in a proposed
Shoshonean group and have linked P i m a n and Taracahitic, and at
times Cora-Huichol and Nahua also, in a group called Sonoran.
Miller's (1984) recent classification is intermediate to these:4

language. ( M i l l e r 1 9 8 4 : 1 2 1 . )5
1.2.1. ""What's in a name?"": Nahua and P i p i l . The name ""Nahua""
i s used here to r e f e r t o any v a r i e t y , be i t a d i a l e c t or independent language, of the Nahua subgroup. This term i s purposefully
n o n s p e c i f i c to avoid the confusion t h a t other names used in the
l i t e r a t u r e have produced. I t i s important to explain some of these
terms in order to unravel some of this confusion.
North American linguists tend to speak of the ""Aztec"" language.
This, however, i s unclear because the language i s not a d i r e c t
r e f l e c t i o n of Aztec culture, since i t was spoken contemporaneously
a l s o by non-Aztecs ( e . g . the T l a x c a l a n s ) . Other names which have
been used in reference to v a r i e t i e s of Nahua are: Nahuatl, Nahuat,
Nahuate (Naguate), Mejicano (Mexicano), Mejicano Corrupto (Corrupt
Mexican), P i p i l Nicarao, e t c .
Pochutec of Oaxaca (now e x t i n c t ,
see Boas 1917) i s the most divergent language of the subgroup.
While the case i s l e s s c l e a r , I believe that Central American Pipil
should also be considered a d i s t i n c t language, but more similar to
other v a r i e t i e s than Pochutec i s .
All others are considered dial e c t s of a s i n g l e language, c a l l e d here ""Core Nahua"".
(For more
d e t a i l s concerning Nahua dialectology, see Campbell and Langacker
1978, Canger 1978, 1980, 1983, L a s t r a de Suárez 1974; c f . a l s o
appendices 1 and 2.)
Above a l l , i t i s important to c l a r i f y the term "" P i p i l "" .
For
some scholars ""Pipil"" s i g n i f i e s only the Pipil language of Central
America; t h i s i s i t s most common intended meaning in the s c i e n t i f i c
l i t e r a t u r e and i t i s the usage proposed here as the only clear and
acceptable meaning for the term. Nevertheless, frequently ""Pipil""
has been employed not only for Central American P i p i l , but also for
r e f e r i n g t o Nahua d i a l e c t s of southern Veracruz, Tabasco, and
Chiapas (southern Mexican s t a t e s ) ; c f . , for example, Fowler 1981,
1984, García de León 1976, Hasler 1958a, 1958b, 1961, 1976, Knab
1980, Law 1956, Navarrete 1 9 7 5 : 2 7 9 , Reyes Garcia 1958, Swadesh
1954-1955, etc.
A d e t a i l e d a n a l y s i s ( s e e appendix 1) of the
a v a i l a b l e data shows t h a t a t one l e v e l t h e s e t h r e e v a r i e t i e s ,
C e n t r a l American P i p i l , Chiapas Nahua, and d i a l e c t s of southern
Veracruz and Tabasco, share certain t r a i t s which suggest a possible
c l o s e r h i s t o r i c a l connection among them (Canger 1980, L a s t r a de
Suárez 1974). On the other hand, Central American P i p i l i s in
s e v e r a l r e s p e c t s q u i t e d i s t i n c t from t h e s e and a l l other Nahua
varieties.
At i s s u e ,
t h e n , i s both t h e name and t h e
classification.
The d i f f e r e n c e s a r e s u f f i c i e n t t o r e q u i r e a
d i s t i n c t name in order to avoid confusion. However, the question
of c l a s s i f i c a t i o n i s complicated by the need to interpret both the
shared s i m i l a r i t i e s and the differences. Those who emphasize the
s i m i l a r i t i e s c l a s s i f y C e n t r a l American P i p i l c l o s e r to t h e s e6
v a r i e t i e s , but i t s d i f f e r e n c e s s u g g e s t a c l a s s i f i c a t i o n which
r e f l e c t s greater distance and divergence.
Among the more marked d i f f e r e n c e s , i t i s worth pointing out the
following:
1) P i p i l has -_t ' p l u r a l ' where o t h e r s have -Ji ( o r
which c o r r e s p o n d s t o j i in o t h e r d i a l e c t s ) ; c f . s e c t i o n
3.1.4.
2) I n P i p i l - t u - k i s t h e ' p e r f e c t ' o r ' p a s t
p a r t i c i p l e ' ( c f . section 3.7.2.3), while in others -tuk
/ - t o k i s a p r o g r e s s i v e e n d i n g , s o m e t i m e s used
a d j e c t i v a l l y . For example, i n P i p i l wa:k-tuk means ""dry""
( ' a d j e c t i v e ' ) o r "" i t h a s d r i e d "" ( ' p e r f e c t ' ) , but i n
P a j a p a n , Veracruz corresponding wa:k-tok means ""dry""
( ' a d j e c t i v e ' ) but a l s o "" i t i s drying"" ( ' p r o g r e s s i v e ' ) .
3) P i p i l has no absolutive s u f f i x with nouns that end
in - 1 and i t s occurrence with polysyllabic nouns ending
with o t h e r consonants i s very l i m i t e d .
These o t h e r
v a r i e t i e s have the absolutive s u f f i x in these contexts.
4) In P i p i l the sequence kwaw generally did not become
ko as i t did in several of these other v a r i e t i e s .
5) P i p i l has a number o f l e x i c a l and o t h e r s p o r a d i c
d i f f e r e n c e s , for example:
nu:tsa ""to speak""
(corresponding forms mean ""to c a l l "" in others), nemi ""to
be"" ( "" t o l i v e "" i n o t h e r s ) , a t i m e - t "" l o u s e "" ( a t e m i - t or
a t i m i - t i n o t h e r s ) , e t c . ( c f . appendix 1 f o r more
details).
While t h e s e d i f f e r e n c e s a r e c l e a r l y s i g n i f i c a n t , their
h i s t o r i c a l weight i s not c l e a r i n each c a s e , s i n c e i t i s i n
p r i n c i p l e possible that these v a r i e t i e s changed a f t e r P i p i l s p l i t
o f f (a p o s s i b i l i t y in 4, for example) or that P i p i l innovated a f t e r
i t s s e p a r a t i o n ( p o s s i b l e i n 5 ) . With such d i f f e r e n c e s i t i s c l e a r
t h a t t h e t e r m "" P i p i l "" s h o u l d be used w i t h c a u t i o n .
It is
p r e f e r i b l e to reserve i t s use s o l e l y f o r Central American P i p i l in
o r d e r to avoid c o n f u s i o n . The c o m p l i c a t e d q u e s t i o n of P i p i l ' s
c l a s s i f i c a t i o n within Nahua i s taken up i n d e t a i l in Appendix 1.

now t u r n t o i t s h i s t o r y .
There are h i s t o r i c a l traditions
c o n c e r n i n g t h e a r r i v a l o f t h e P i p i l s to C e n t r a l America.
While
they provide i m p o r t a n t i n f o r m a t i o n , t h e i r i n t e r p r e t a t i o n i s not
without c o m p l i c a t i o n s . The a c c o u n t s a r e r e g i s t e r e d i n two main
s o u r c e s , Torquemada ( 1 6 1 5 / 1 9 6 9 / ) and Oviedo ( 1 9 4 5 / 1 5 5 7 / ) , and i n
several minor references, e.g. I x t l i l x o c h i t l
(1952/1600-1611/),7
Clavijero (1974/ca.l775/), and Fuentes y Guzmán (1932-1933/1695/).
These have been interpreted by Stoll (1884/1958/), Lehmann (1920),
Thompson (1948), Chapman (1960), Jiménez Moreno (1959, 1966), León
Portilla (1972), Campbell (1978) and Fowler (1981, 1983). I begin
this survey by citing the primary accounts, which report the oral
traditions of the Nicarao. Torquemada tells it this was:
Según se platica, entre los naturales de esta Tierra,
m a i o r m e n t e los viejos, dicen, que los Indios de
Nicaragua, y los de Nicoya (que por otro Nombre, se dicen
Mangnes (Mangues) antiguamente tuvieron su Habitación en
el Despoblado de Xoconochco (Soconusco), que es en la
Governacion de Mexico. Los de Nicoya, decienden de los
Chololtecas. Moraran acia la Sierra, la Tierra adentro;
y los Nicaraguas, que son de la de Anahuac, Mexicanos,
habitaban acia la Costa del Mar del Sur. La vna, y la
otra era raui gran multitud de Gente; dicen que avra
siete, u ocho edades o vidas de Viejos, y estos que
vivían larga vida, hasta venir a ser mui Ancianos, que
vivian tanto, que de viejos los sacaban al Sol. En aquel
tiempo vino sobre ellos vn grande Exercito de Gente, se
decian, Olmecas.
Estos dicen que vinieron de ácia
Mexico, y que antiguamente avian sido Capitales Enemigos
de aquellos, que estaban poblados, en el Despoblado, que
aora es entre Xoconochco (Soconusco), y Tequantepec
(Tehuantepec). Estos Olmecas, dieron Guerra, vencieron,
y sujetaron a los Naturales, y pusiéronles grandes
Tributos, ...
...
demandaron Consejo á sus Alfaquies, que les
dixesen, qué debian hacer, que yá no podían sufrir tan
Tiranos Tributos ... dixeron: Que se apericibiesen
para que todos en vn dia, lo mas secreto, que pudiesen,
levantasen sus Mugeres, y Niños, y sus Haciendas, y se
fuesen adelante, y dexasen aquella Tierra ... salieron
de aquella Tierra, que antes avian morado, con grande
contentamiento, y gusto.
Despues, que començaron á caminar, á los veinte dias
se les murió vno de los dos Alfaquies Principales, que
diximos.
Pasaron por la Tierra de Guauhtemallan
(Guatemala), y anduvieron cerca de cien Leguas adelante.
Allegaron á vna Provincia, que los Españoles llaman la
Cholulteca, ó Choroteca, y alli se les murió el otro
Alfaque. Antes que muriese, les dixo ... a los de
Nicoya, que iban en la delantera: Vosotros sois malos,
porque verná (vendrá) tiempo, que serviereis á vnos8Hombres Blancos Barbudos,
... y os t r a t a r á n mal, y
peor, que l o s Olmecas.
También d i x o á l o s Olmecas:

Ixtlilxochitl (1695/1952/) also spoke of these migrations,
relating them to the destruction of the Toltec kingdom in 959 A.D.
and Xolotl's entrance:
y los pocos tultecas que habían escapado de su
destrucción, los dejó vivir en los puestos y lugares en
donde estaban reformados y poblados cada uno con su
familia, que fué en Chapoltepec, Colhuacan, Tlatzalantepexoxoma, Totolapan, Quauhquecholan, y hasta las costas
del mar del Norte en Tozapan, Tochpan, Tziuhcoac y
Xicotepec, y lo mismo en Chololan, aunque algunos de
ellos no pasaron sino hasta la tierra de Nicaragua á
donde fueron á poblar, y á otras tierras remotas, en
donde no llegó con tanta fuerza la seca y calamidad
referida (Don Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1952.2:36-7).
Interpretations of these accounts have been varied and at times
quite controversial. For example, Squier (1852) took the palm tree
in the Mexican representation of Aztlan, the legendary northern
homeland of the Aztecs, to mean that Nahua speakers must have
originated in the south, migrating from Nicaragua and El Salvador
to central Mexico (cf. Stoll 1958/1884/:7-8). Today all hold
Squier's view to be quite mistaken, agreeing that the Nahua
speakers come into Mesoamerica from the north, with subsequent
migrations to Central America from central Mexico.
Most interpretations attempt to analyze Torquemada and Oviedo.
According to Torquemada (just cited), the Nicarao left Soconusco
(the Pacific Coast of Chiapas) ""seven or eight ages or lives of an
old man"" before. This ""age of an old man"" has generally been
interpreted as the period called in Nahuatl huehuetiliztli, which
is two 52-year cycles of the Mesoamerican calendar, or 104 years.
Consequently, Jiménez Moreno (1966:67) and most other scholars have
taken this to mean that the Pipil migration to Central America took
place around 728 to 832 years before its telling in 1580, or
approximately 800 A.D. Lehmann (1920:1005), in contrast, held a
different opinion:
Es ist sehr Wahrscheinlich, dass Torquemada diesen
Bericht, der offenbar mehrere Wandersagen in eine verschmilzt, von Fray Toribio Motolinia Übernommen hat ...
BehHlt man das im Auge, so bezieht sich die Zeitangabe
Uber die Abwanderung der Nicarao aus Mexiko wohl nicht
auf die Zeit Torquemada's, sondern auf diejenige
Motolinia's (um 1526). Zieht man davon die ""7 - 8

J a h r e n ab, so kommt man auf etwa 966 o d e r 886 n. Chr.;

1600) rückwärts gerechnet h a t , so kommt man auf 1040 oder
960 n. Chr. Die Einwanderung der N i c a r a o würde a l s o i n

he f o r g o t t h a t Torquemada spoke of t h e i r a r r i v a l i n Soconusco from
Anahuac, i d e n t i f i e d with the Valley of Cholula ( c f . Chapman 1960).
Thus, Torquemada was not in f a c t g u i l t y , as Lehmann's claimed, of
placing t h e scene erroneously in Soconusco i n s t e a d of near Cholula.

Aus d i e s e r Eigentümlichkeit darf man wohl den Schluss
ziehen, dass die t l - l o s e n Dialekte s i c h vom Toltekischen11
ableiten, das ja eben ein vom Aztekischen (Mexikanischen)
""etwas"" abweichendes Idiom, ein Nahuat, war.
Mithin
müssen die Nahuatl-Pipil Dialekte in ihrem Ursprung älter
sein als die schon altertümlichen Hymnen Sahagun's, weil
das Toltekische dem Aztekischen spracahlich, kulturhistorisch und archäologisch vorhergeht. Da das Izalco von
Salvador nach meinen Aufnahmen vollere grammatische Form e n bewahrt als das Mexikanisch-Aztekische, so folgt
daraus, dass das erste A l t a z t e k i s c h e der H y m n e n
Sahagun's, älter als das Pipil Guatemalas (Lehmann
1920:990).
Lehmann's equation of ¿ - d i a l e c t s with the Toltecs and hence
Pipil (a ¿-dialect) migrations with the Toltec dispersion has been
important, not because it is necessarily accurate, but because it
has been influential. For example, Luckenbach and Levy (1980) and
Fowler (1981) present such nearly identical conclusions about multiple migrations (with Pipil and Nicarao separated), Toltec connections, proposed dates, and the importance of ¿-dialects (as opposed
particularly to tl-dialects), that it is difficult to believe their
conclusions were not strongly influenced by Lehmann's opinions.
Notwithstanding Lehmann's influence on later studies, his conclusions seem also conditioned by his possible reading of earlier
sources. For example, Ixtlilxochitl (cited above) claimed that the
Toltec diaspora resulted in migrations to Nicaragua — Nicarao (and
Pipil) being ¿-dialects. Clavijero could also be the source:
Sabemos que los Toltecas y los Cicimecas (Chichimecas),
los Cicimecas (sic) y los Acolhuls se comunicaban en
común entre sí desde el principio, y se entendían reciprocamente sin intérpretes. El encontrarse la lengua
mexicana difundida hasta Nicaragua no puede atribuirse a
otra cosa sino a la dispersion de los Toltecas, que la
hablaban, porque no se sabe que los Nahuatlacos hayan
entrado más allá de Chiapan (Clavaijero 2:153, cited by
Stoll 1958/1884/ : 29-30).
In spite of Lehmann's influence, most modern investigators have
accepted Torquemada's account as accurate, and joining it with
Oviedo's, they have proposed a reasonable picture of Pipil ethnohistory. According to their reconstructions (cf. particularly
J i m é n e z Moreno 1966:63-7), the Pipils left the area of Cholula,
Puebla (specifically Ticomega and Maguatega) in order to escape the
tyranny of the historical Olmecs. They came to southern Veracruz,
but shortly after were displaced again, arriving in Xolotlan (the12
Soconusco Coast of C h i a p a s ) . L a t e r , once a g a i n t o e s c a p e t h e

As mentioned, in c o n t r a s t t o t h i s view, Fowler (1981) has taken
a p o s i t i o n in sympathy with Lehmann's. He sees "" P i p i l "" migrations

l a t e r movements out of Soconusco toward Central America. However,

d a t e s with the conquest of Cholula by the h i s t o r i c a l Olmecs and the13
departure of the Pipils from there at about 800 A.D., then perhaps
we would be in a better position to explain the nature of the
postulated relationship shared by Pipil, Isthmus (Gulf), and Sierra
de Puebla Nahua. Given the consensus that the Pipil left central
Mexico and migrated first to the southern Gulf region, it is to be
expected that the Pipil language would share some linguistic traits
with varieties from that area. The question remains, however,
about how the differences are to be understood and about how long
Pipil has been separated from whatever its nearest neighbors or
relatives may be (see appendix 1).
1.4. Pipil dialectology. Having considered Pipil's ethnohistory and its position relative to other varieties of Nahua, I now
turn to an inspection of Pipil's own regional variation. My original intent in studying Pipil dialects was to determine where the
language is still spoken and to obtain a general characterizataion
of local dialect variation. The goal was not to provide an exhaustive account of minor regional differences. The dialect features
presented here, then, give a good idea of major differences among
local dialects, but it does not provide a comprehensive view of
variation within each location. These dialect traits are presented
in broad phonetic representation, not really phonemic, but
employing the Pipil practical alphabet to the extent that it is
possible (see section 2.1).
(1) In Chiltiupán _ts tends to change to s, e.g. saput ""Zapote""
(from tsaput; susukul ""water jug (cántaro)"" (from tsutsukul); etc.
(2) In Concepción de Ataco the vowels i^ and ii have been lost
between stops and semivowels, e.g. kwat ""snake""(from ku(;)wat),
kwa ""to buy"" (from kuwa). maltyá ""to bathe"" (from m-a(:)lti(y)a;
the χ is inserted by rule, cf. 2.2). It should also be noticed
that the lost vowel would ordinarily bear stress when in penultimate position and consequently stress is shifted to the final
vowel.
(3) Originally the final and preconsonantal -1_ of Pipil (and
probably of Proto-Nahua as well) was devoiced (1), but today there
is considerable variation between voiced and voiceless pronunciation in these position and even in other positions in certain
dialects. In Cuisnahuat the voiced and voiceless counterparts vary
rather freely in final position. Final -1 is always voiceless in
Jicalapa. In Teotepeque, the voiceless 1 (1) has been generalized
to all positions; that is, ¿ has changed totally to
everywhere,
e.g. peíu ""dog"", tihian ""chicken"", tekutut ""owl"", kumat ""griddle"",
chiitik ""red"", maitiya ""to bathe"", kai ""house"", etc.
In Jicalapa, not only is final
devoiced, but 1_ in all
positions is palatalized, lj, prepalatalized finally,
Some14
exampales are: pel^u ""dog"", tihlyan ""chicken"", tekulyut ""owl"",
chakalyin ""shrimp"", el^ut ""ear of corn"", ul y ut ""corncob"", kumayl·
""griddle"", taxka^i ""tortilla"", tuna^t ""sun"", Imamat ""old woman"",
ka?l· ""house"", etc.
(4) In Teotepeque χ (/δ/) has changed to / V , a retroflexed
fricative, and now is in free variation with rr (/?/). I believe
the later change to rr. is due to Spanish influence. There is
sociolinguistically conditioned variation in local Spanish between
r and '·è, where at least nearby in Guatemala the s
· variant is
stigmatized. I believe that the negative value placed on this
variant in Spanish has contributed to the Teotepeque change to r, a
change in the direction of the prestige variant in Spanish, the
dominant language in this setting. Some examples are:
Suchit /
ruchit ""flower"", suiet / rul-et ""old man"", teskan ""tick1', sukut
""hogplum"", a'san ""now"".
(5)Teotepeque and Comasaguya have a before ¿ in monosyllabic
roots where others dialects have e¿ e.g. -may ""hand"", -kway
""skirt"".
(6) Pipil k has several variants in the different dialects, but
in every case the underlying segment remains Je. In Cuisnahuat Jc is
voiced and sometimes fricativized ¿ between two vowels when the
first is long or if both are ji's. Occasionally it is voiced initially in certain words, particulary frequent with k(i)~ 'third
person sg. pronominal' prefix.
In Santo Domingo de Guzmán k is
voiced
initially, intervocalically, and after n. In Tacuba,
it is voiced between vowels. In the other dialects Jc is generally
maintained without change.
In all dialects, final η is velar (g) and the stress falls on
the penultimate syllable except for certain Spanish loans,
occasionally the suffix -tsin (cf. section 3.1.3.8), and those
words in Ataco which lost penultimate i. or ji between stops and
semivowels (see above).
Vowel length is not represented in the list of dialect forms
that follows due to lack of reliable information except for
Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán, where it was investigated
systematically . It is to be supposed, however, that vowel length
in the other dialects, where it still exists, will be nearly the
same as in these two dialects.
The following word lists exemplify the changes and variation in
the individual dialects. The abbreviations are:15At

(7) Reduplicated possessive pronominal prefixes. At times possessed plural nouns show reduplication, not as expected on the
root, but of the possessive prefix. This is most c o m m o n w i t h
monosyllabic nouns, but is not limited to them. Some examples are:
nuh-nu-chi:l my chilis
nuh-nu-kxi
my feet
muh-mu-kxi
your feet
nuh-nu-na:n my mothers
nuh-nu-mey
my hands
ih-i-mey
his handsnuh-nu-ma:taxkal my palms
nuh-nu-ku:ts
my legs
ih-i-tan
her teeth
or i-tah-tan
tuh-tu-kumal
our griddles
or tu-kuh-kumalThe more usual possessed plural nouns have reduplication on the
noun root, e.g.:
i-eh-ehtapal
i-ih-.i:x
i-nah-nakas
i-kah-kamakits wings
his eyes
her ears
his cheeksIt should be noted that adjectives and verbs may also
reduplicated (see sections 3.6.6 and 3.7.5).beOther aspects of nouns and noun phrases are treated in the
following chapter. For example, for the incorporation of noun
objects into the verb, see section 4.13.3.
3.2. Pronouns
3.2.1. Independent pronouns. The full or independent pronouns
are optional, given that in any case subject and object pronominal
affixes are required with the verb. The independent pronouns are:
naha
I
taha
you (singular)
yaha
he/she/it
tehemet
we
amehemet (SD),
an-ehemet (C) you (plural)
yehemet
they
In normal speech these may optionally appear in an abbreviated
forra, if they bear no particular emphasis, e.g.:54
na, nah
ta, tah
ya, yah
te(:)met
ame(:)t,
an=e(:)met
ye(:)metI
you (singular)
he/she/it

cross-reference to independent subjects (see section 3.7.4). These
prefixes co-occur w i t h the plural suffix -t_ on the verb when the
subject is a plural person. The subject pronminal affixes, then,
are:
niti0-tlan0--t
-t
-tyou (singular)
he/she/it

These prefixes lose the final vowel before the 'directional' morpheme (w)al-, i.e. appearing as 11- and t_- (see sections 2 . 2 and
3.7.6.1).
3.2.2.1. Pronominal copula. There is an equational construction
in which a pronominal subject has a noun or adjective as complement
which is formed by merely affixing these pronominal subject morphemes to the complement. Its form and function are best grasped
from the following examples:
ni-ta:kat
ti-ta:kat
taha ti-mayordomoh
an=ehemet an-nu-a:migitus
ni-tuma:wak
ni-tsumpe:suh
taha tesu ti-lionahI am a man

4.16. Conditional sentences. In section 3.7.2.4 i t was seen
that the conditional morpheme of verbs i s -skiya. In this section
conditional sentences are described. These usually contain a verb
with the - s k i y a s u f f i x in the apodosis, while the conditional
clause i s most frequently introduced by (a)su "" i f "" . Some examples
are:
1) asu ahsi yaha n-u: ni-k-taxta:wia.
i f arrive he I-go I-him-pay.
"" I f he arrives I , am going to pay him.""
2) yaha ahsi-tu-skiya, ni-k-taxta:wih-tu-skiya.
he arrive-PERF-COND, I-him-pay-PERF-COND.
""Had he come, I'd have paid him.""
3) ni-k-pix-(s)kiya tumin, ni-k-kuwa-skiya turuh.
I-it-have-COND money, I-it-buy-COND cow.
""Had I money, I ' d buy cows.""
4) Nah su te: n i - t e k i t i , te: ni-ta-kwa.
I i f no I-work, no I-something-eat.
"" I , i f I don't work, I don't e a t . ""136
5) ni-mits-maka-skiya se: mu-tamal pero tesu ni-k-piya.
I-you-give-COND a your-tortilla but no I-it-have.
""I would give you a tortilla but I don't have (any).""
6) ni-k-kwa-skiya pero tesu ni-maya:na.
I-it-eat-COND but no I-hunger.
""I would eat it but I'm not hungry.""
7) ti-yu-t ti-yawi-t a ber su ti-mu-chiwa alegrár chupi.

""Let's go to see if you (will) cheer up a little.""
8) muchi ne doktores panu-tiwi-t a ber a:su ki-pahtia-t.
(R-16)

""All the doctors have come by to see if they (could) cure
him.""
4.17. Auxiliaries. Pipil has two principal auxiliary verbs,
nemi ""to be"", used in 'progressive' constructions, and yawi ""to
go"", used in the periphrastic 'future' constructions. Two other
verbs have a function intermediate between auxiliaries and main
verbs, weli ""to be able, can"" and pe:wa ""to begin"", while yawi
(particularly in non-'present' tenses) also participates in a non'future' auxiliary construction. These latter three are considered
auxiliaries, not only because of their function, but because of
their form. That is, these typically do not bear the pronominal
prefixes which the main verbs bear, while in other constructions of
verb + verb both verbs bear these prefixes. These are described in
this section.
4.17.1. Nemi 'progressive'. In the progressive, nemi more often
follows the main verb, but it can also precede it with no change in
function. Some examples are:
1) k-ita ta: ki-chiwa nemi ne i-siwa:-w. (N-13)
it-see what it-do is the his-wife-POSS.
""(He) sees what his wife is doing.""
2) nu-lama mitsin-chiwa nemi hodér. (N-85)
my-grandmother you pi.-do is screw.
""My grandmother is screwing you (pi.).""","[148, 149, 150]"

Spanish, although there i s in a d d i t i o n a length c o n t r a s t . The

-nich- ""me"" ( ' f i r s t person singlular object pronoun'), etc.
Vowel length i s an important c o n t r a s t , but i t i s d i f f i c u l t to
determine in many cases. There are such minimal pairs as pa;ta ""to
melt"" / pata ""to change""; ne: "" t h e r e "" / ne ' d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e ' ; the
roots m e : t s - ""moon"" / mets- "" t h i g h "" ; e t c . , but such p a i r s are not
f r e q u e n t . The d i f f i c u l t y i s t h a t , due to P i p i l ' s moribund s t a t e ,
many speakers no longer make the vowel-length contrast, or they do
i t only in more f o r m a l c o n t e x t s . Among my main c o n s u l t a n t s in
Cuisnahuat, one lacked the contrast altogether, another had i t only
in formal contexts (for example when c a r e f u l l y comparing l i n g u i s t i c
forms, reciting word l i s t s , etc.), and a third used i t consistently
throughout his speech. In Santo Domingo de Guzmán my consultants
generally lacked the contrast in everyday speech, but were able to
produce the d i s t i n c t i o n s when queried about i n d i v i d u a l words.
Nevertheless, only two individuals there maintained the distinction
consistently in a way r e l a t i v e l y easy to perceive.
In both dialects the léngth contrast i s clear only in stressed
s y l l a b l e s , i.e. the penultimate, in most forms. Notwithstanding,
in many cases d i f f e r e n t s y l l a b l e s may be stressed in derivations
with v a r i e d p r e f i x e s or s u f f i x e s , e.g. / m a s a : - t / ( m á s a t ) "" d e e r "" .
/ m a s a : - t s i n / ( m a s á r t s i g ) "" l i t t l e deer""; / t e : l p u : c h / ( t é : l p u c h )
""son"", / t e : l p u : c h - t s i n / ( t e l p ú r c h t s i g ) "" l i t t l e son""; /tekuma-t/
(tekúmat) ""bottle gourd"", /nu-tekun/ (nutékug) ""my b o t t l e gourd"",
/ t e k u m a - t s i n / (tekumátsirj) "" l i t t l e bottle gourd"" (""tecomatillo"");
etc. (These examples are cited from Cuisnahuat dialect).
In Cuisnahuat a l l w o r d - i n i t i a l vowels a r e p h o n e t i c a l l y long,
although those followed by a single consonant are longer than those
f o l l o w e d by two, e.g. / i : s a / ( i : s a ) ""to wake up"", / u l u - t / ( u : l u t )
""corncob"", / i s t a - t / ( i ' s t a t ) "" s a l t "" . Underlying vowel length can
be determined in such forms by f i n d i n g the form with some p r e f i x
which removes the vowel from word-initial position, e.g. /uh-ulu-t/
(uhúlut) ""corncobs"", /nu-ulu/ (nu(w)úlu) ""my corncob"",
/n-i:sa-k/
( n i : s a k ) "" I woke up"". Santo Domingo de Guzmán has undergone c e r t a i n changes with r e s p e c t to vowel length in t r i s y l l a b i c words,
p a r t i c u l a r l y verbs. With V to r e p r e s e n t a s y l l a b l e , forms with

3.7.4.2. ta- 'unspecified object 1 . In addition to the object
pronominal prefixes already presented, Pipil has another which is
employed to show that the (non-human) object of a transitive verb
is not specified. Verbs with this prefix, ta-, are translated with
an object ""something"" or ""to be doing"" whatever the action of the
verb is, without specifying what the object of the action is; cf.
ni-ta-hkwilua ""I a m
writing"" or ""I write (something)"" /
ni-k-ihkwilua ""I write it"". For example, ta- forms are much used
for answering the question, ""what are you doing?""; the answer might
be, for example, ni-ta-istawia ""I'm salting"".
That is, the
'unspecified object' ta- is natural in contexts where the action of
the verb is in focus and the object is of little relevance, as seen
in these forms:
ni-ta-u:ya
I am shelling (corn)
(cf. ni-k-u: ya ""I shell it"")
ni-ta-ilpia
I am tying
(cf. ni-k-ilpia ""I tie it"")
ni-ta-ku:taraima
I throw something
(cf. ki-ku:tamima ""he throws it"")
Some instances of verbs with ta- are:

Non-productive and special ta- forms.
In a few
verbs the ta- prefix is no longer optional, but has become a frozen
part of the verb root. Normally, verbs with ta- as the unspecified
object do not permit the simultaneous occurrence of k(i)~, the
'third person singular pronominal object 1 prefix. However, the
verbs with frozen ta- do take the k(i)~ object marker.
In other
cases the optional ta- prefix is added, but either with specialized
semantic senses or irregular phonological outcomes.
Some
instances of both kinds are:
tah-a:na
to pick up (cf. a:na ""to pick up"")
ta-chpa:na (C)
to sweep (cf. uchpa:na ""to sweep"";
(t-uchpa:na (SD); normally only initial _i before two consonants is lost with ta-)
takwi:ka

tah-ta-ketsa

takimiltia

3.7.4.2.2. Reduplication of ta-. The ta- prefix is reduplicated
with iterative verbs or with plural objects, e.g.:
tah-ta-chiya
tah-ta-ketsa
tah-ta-mu:tato look a lot, to have fun
to chat (cf. ta-ketsa ""to talk"")
to throw (things)(Cf. 3.7.5 for details about verb reduplication.)79

verbs. Some examples are:

3.7.5. Reduplication in verbs. There are two types of reduplic a t i o n that verbs p a r t i c i p a t e in.
Both r e d u p l i c a t e the i n i t i a l
consonant(s) and the f i r s t vowel of the root, or only the vowel i f
no consonant occurs. In both c a s e s the vowel i s s h o r t . They
d i f f e r in that one has only t h i s form ( i . e . (C)V-) while the other
takes an additional Ji (i.e. (C)Vh-). The later i s quite productive
and many examples of i t are presented in the dictionary (chapter
5). The former ((C)V-) i s not productive, but many examples of i t
e x i s t , typically with -ka or - t s a verbs (see below). I t means that

3.7.6.1. (w)al- 'directional'. The directional prefix (w)almeans ""hither"", i.e. motion toward the speaker or toward where the
action of the verb takes place. It is derived historically from
wa:lah ""to come"" ('preterite' form). The allomorph w a l - appears
only if no other prefix precedes it; otherwise, the -al- allomorph
occurs. Also, this is the only prefix before which all the subject
pronominal prefixes lose their final vowel, if they have one, e.g.:
n-al-kl:xtia
t-al-ki:xtia
k-al-ki:xtia
t-al-ki:xtia-t

acts, or ""inside"". It appears with verb roots, but also with other
categories as well:

non-productive verbal prefix now frozen as part of the root, which
probably meant acts done w i t h the mouth, although today this
meaning is far from clear. It also occurs with some non-verbal
forms. The examples are:
ahkamacha:lua

This order is seen in examples such as:

In P i p i l there are a number of s u f f i x e s which s i g n a l "" v o i c e ""
(changes in the r e l a t i o n s h i p between a verb and i t s arguments
(subject and o b j e c t s ) ) and ""mood"" (the a t t i t u d e of the speaker
toward the action of the verb).
This section t r e a t s these
morphemes.
3.7.8.1. 'Imperative'/'optative'/'sub j u n c t i v e ' . The second person ' i m p e r a t i v e ' morpheme i s x i - / χ - , the x.- allomorph before
vowels, x i - preceding consonants.
I t s sense i s 'imperative' or
'subjunctive/optative'. There are also ' i m p e r a t i v e ' forms f o r the
other persons (save f i r s t singular) composed of the e x h o r t a t i v e
p a r t i c l e ma;, which functions l a r g e l y l i k e the que with Spanish
subjunctives when these are employed imperatively or exhortatively.
Plural forms take the s u f f i x -kan, whose underlying form i s
a c t u a l l y /-kam-/, but the m appears only when the c l i t i c ~(y)a
""already"" (emphasis) i s attached to i t . Since this combination i s
rather rare, i t i s most often seen in the autonomous phonemic form
-kan. Since the combination of t i - and -kan are s u f f i c i e n t to mark
f i r s t person plural imperatives, the ma: i s optional in this case.
The verb root normally appears in the 'present'-stem form ( w i t h
f i n a l vowel), but Class I I I verbs ( - i a . ua) lack both the vowel and
the ji that they have in other contexts (e.g. x i - n e c h - i l w i "" t e l l
me!""; c f . t i - n e c h - i l w i a ""you t e l l me"", t i - n e c h - i l w i h ""you t o l d
me""). The imperative forms are best apprehended by considering the
following paradigm:
xi-k-kwa
ma: ki-kwa
(ma:) ti-k-kwa-kan
xi-k-kwa-kan
ma: ki-kwa-kaneat i t ! (you s g . )
l e t him/her eat!
l e t ' s eat i t !
eat i t ! (you p i . )
l e t them eat i t !","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

3) ya:h-ki ni-m-a:ltia.

""I went to take a bathe.""
4.17.4. Weli ""to be able, can"". Weli lacks pronominal prefixes
and precedes the main verb which bears the pronoun markers. That
is, ""I can walk"" is literally ""can I-walk"". Some examples are:
1) weli ni-nehnerai wehka.
can I-walk far.
""I can walk far.""
2) a:n te: weli ni-k-kwa pero mu:sta nl-yawi ni-ta-kwa we:y.

not-now no c a n — P R E T REFLEX-stick.
""(She) could no longer stick herself on.""
4.17.5. Pe:wa ""to begin, start"". The verb pe:wa occurrs very
often in an auxiliary-like construction preceding the main verb but
without pronominal prefixes (which are born by the main verb). It
is equivalent in effect to English sentences with ""to start"", e.g.
""they started running"". Some sample instances are:140

4.18. Complex verb phrases. Pipil has other constructions in
which two (or more) verbs occur together within the same (surfacestructure) verb phrase in constructions which would correspond to
infinitival forms in English or Spanish (i.e. sentences which have
undergone Equivalent Noun-Phrase Deletion, see below). Within this
more general class of juxtaposed verb forms, three verbs (wiîts ""to
come"", ki:sa ""to leave"", and -neki ""to want"") have a function
intermediate between full, main verbs and auxiliaries. They a r e
best apprehended from examples.","[152, 153, 154]"

4.2.5.3. Irregular ""to be"" forms. Some irregular forms which
function as adjectives with the sense of ""to be"" are:
se:n-kak
to be together (cf. se:(η) ""one, together"")
mu-ets-tuk (C), to be seated
mu-es-tuk (SD)
ihka-tuk
to be standing
A construction with
is also found in the cleft sentences (cf.
4.16); other nemi constructions include its auxiliary function in
'progressives' (see 4.20.1). (Cf. also the -ti 'inchoative'
suffix, 3.7.8.3.3.)4.3. Non-distinct arguments
The concept of non-distinctness refers to transitive sentences
in which the subject and direct object are either coreferential or
one of these arguments (subject or direct object) is not specified.
The kinds of 'non-distinct' arguments are passives, reflexives,
impersonale, and unspecified direct-object markers (cf. Langacker
1977:46-8). Many of these forms were already considered in the
morphology (chapter 3); for 'reflexives' (-mu-) cf. 3.7.4.1, for
the 'unspecified object' markers, see 3.7.4.2. (both te:- human and
ta- nonhuman); passive verb morphology (-lu-, -ua) was treated in
3.7.8.4.
There is also an impersonal construction formed of 'third
personal plural' verbs (i.e. with the suffix -t) where the subject
is not otherwise specified, meaning, e.g. ""fish are eaten in
Japan"", that is equivalent to English ""they"" in ""they eat fish in
Japan"". For example:
1) nech-tawilih-ke-t ne pe:lu.
me-give-PRET-PL the dog.
""They gave me the dog."" - ""I was given the dog.""
2) de mala swerte ki-mu:tia-t.
of bad luck him frighten-PL.
""Unfortunately they frightened him."" • ""Unfortunately, he
was frightened.""","[126, 127]"
"(A-17)se:
a5) SVO: ne i-siwa:-w ki-miktih ne chumpipi. (H-12) (subject
emphasis)
the his-wife-POSS it-killed the turkey.
""His wife killed the turkey.""
Intransitive sentences, on the other hand, rarely deviate from
the basic Verb-Subject (VS) order. The combination Verb-Object
(VO) is found often in transitive sentences in which the subject is
pronominal and hence signaled by a verb prefix. Similarly, the
order Verb-Subject (VS) also occurs in transitive sentences w h e n
the object is pronominal and marked with prefixes on the verb.
A few examples of verb-initial transitive sentences which lack
independent subjects or objects, these being signaled by pronominal
prefixes, are:
1) VO: ki-chiw-ki ne komidah. (H-12)
it-made-PRET the food.
""She made the food.""",[118]

length and g l o t t a l stop more d i r e c t l y and r e l i a b l y than o t h e r
colonial authors. The Carochi material i s taken from the dictionary compiled by Adrian e t a l . ( 1 9 7 6 ) from C a r o c h i ' s works. A few
forms a r e c i t e d from Una Canger ( 1 9 8 0 ) , i n d i c a t e d by UC. When
t h e s e s o u r c e s do not have the form or have something d i f f e r e n t ,
words are cited from Siméon (1977), abbreviated Sim., a very extensive dictionary. When Simeón proves unclear or incomplete, Molina
(1571 (shown as Mol.)) i s cited.
When a d i r e c t equivalent in CN i s

such forms are cited in the orthography of the source. Proto-Nahua

Nasals a s s i m i l a t e to the p o i n t o f

t h e v e l a r n a s a l ( g ) appears i n t h i s c o n t e x t b e f o r e d e n t a l s and
a l v e o l a r s . The velar nasal occurs before most other consonants and
word-finally.
Since ¿ ( v e l a r nasal) i s p r e d i c t a b l e in these36positions and is not contrastive with other nasals in any other
environment, it is traditionally treated as an allophone of /n/.
Thus, when an underlying /n/ appears in these contexts as a phonetic velar nasal (g) it is not signalled directly in the orthography, but rather is simply written as n. However, when an underlying /m/ is converted to ij word-finally, it is a morphophonemic
change and is represented in the basically autonomous phonemic
orthography as 11, to which the velar allophone is attributed in
these positions. An /m/ may find itself in final position, and
hence phonetically jj, due to the prior application of the vowelloss rule. Some examples are:
atimi-t ""louse""
ku:mi-t ""pot, jug""
tekuma-t ""bottle gourd""
mu-ahsuma ""to comb
oneself""
ta-htsuma ""to sew""

3.7.4.1. 'Reflexive' (mu-). By the notion ""reflexive"" one does
not usually understand a pronominal form, but the 'reflexive'
m o r p h e m e s in Nahua have typically been treated as pronominal
because in central Mexican dialects they pattern with other pronominal prefixes and vary according to person. The 'reflexive'
morpheme of Pipil is mu- with all persons. Its phonological shape
is normally mu in all contexts, including before vowels, where it
is phonetically (muw-) alternating freely with (mw-) is faster
speech. However, there are a few prevocalic cases where it is
simply m - (see 2.2). Some of these appear to have the m - fused as
part of the root and it is no longer recognized as the historical
reflexive that lies behind it. Nevertheless, in these cases there
exist other derivations which show the root without the otherwise
frozen reflexive.
(See below; cf. section 2.2.) Example of
preconsonantal and prevocalic 'reflexive' paradigms are:
ni-mu-ta:lia
I sit (literally ""I place myself"")
ti-mu-ta:lia
you (sg.) sit
mu-ta:lia
he/she/it sits
ti-mu-ta:lia-t

he/she/it washes hlm-/her-/itself

mu-i:xpa:ka

mu-te:ka
mu-tu :nalwia
mu-tsinta:lia

to get drunk

to lie down

related non-reflexive forms, are:
m-a:ltia
to bathe (oneself)
m-a:wiltia
to play
m-ihtutia
to dance
m-i:naya

m-ihkwani

to bathe
k-a:wiltia to paly it
k-ihtutia to dance it
k-i:naya
to hide it
k-ihkwani to remove itA few verbs which are reflexive in form have developed specialized
senses :
m u - c h i w a to grow
mu-neki
to need(from c h i w a ""tamake"")
(from neki ""to want"")There is one suppletive form with mu-, derived from a verb but used
as an adjective: mu-e(t)s-tuk ""seated, sitting"".
With respect to the order of verbal prefixes, subject pronominale precede mu-, but the object pronominal prefixes and the
reflexive are mutually exclusive, both occupying the ""object""
position.

'reflexive* and either the (w)al- 'directional' or -el- 'mentation/

(w)al-mu-ne:lwia
el-mu-yawato hurry
to be nauseated(Cf. 2.2 and 3.7.6.1.)
In the dictionary (chapter 5) reflexive verbs are not listed
independently (under mu- , but rather are found under the verb root
w i t h the abbreviation r.v. to indicate that the root occurs w i t h
the reflexive morpheme.","[88, 89, 90]"

"P i p i l and the classification of NahuaWith the argument presented in chapter 1 that Central American
P i p i l must in some way be considered d i s t i n c t from other Nahua
v a r i e t i e s , the question i s begged, j u s t what i s the p o s i t i o n of
P i p i l within the Nahua subgroup and how does i t r e l a t e to other
dialects?
In the classification proposed here, Nahua consists of
three ""branches"" (independent languages): Pochutec, P i p i l (of
Central America), and Core Nahua ( t o which a l l other v a r i e t i e s
belong, including the s o - c a l l e d "" C l a s s i c a l "" — a l i a s Colonial —
Nahuatl (CN) of the sixteenth century and the various extant
d i a l e c t s of Mexico).
Other c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s which have been
proposed generally coincide with this one in considering Pochutec
as the most divergent member of the group, a separate language.
Nevertheless, several of the proposals d i f f e r in that they group
P i p i l among the dialects of Core Nahua or as a subdivision of some
other imagined Nahua dialect arrangement.
These claims require some examination, although a l l have been
superseded by Una Canger's studies. For that reason, d e t a i l e d
discussion of the dialect t r a i t s upon which classification has been
based i s reserved for l a t e r , f o r the presentation of Canger's case
(see below). For proposals prior to Canger's, I present only the
main claims with respect to the position of P i p i l .
Swadesh (1954-1955:179) held Pochutec and Mexihca ( i . e .
Classical Nahuatl) to be distinct languages, where ""todas las demás
forman una red dialectal"", specified in more detail as:
Los datos indican que e l nahua se d i v i d e en t r e s partes
representadas respectivamente por e l pochuteco, e l nahua
c l á s i c o o mexihca, y no hay d i a l e c t o s t r a n s i c i o n a l e s
entre e l pochuteco y l o s demás, ni tampoco entre e l
mexihca y l o s otros. Aparte de l o s dos t i p o s aislados,
e l r e s t o forma una sola red d i a l e c t a l con d i f e r e n c i a s
paulatinas entre pueblo y pueblo desde l a Huasteca
hasta San Salvador ( P i p i l ) y desde Veracruz hasta e l
Pacífico. (Fernández de Miranda, Swadesh, and Weitlaner
1960:141)
Unfortunately, Swadesh and his associates did not present the
evidence upon which their proposal was based, but, as we shall see
presently, the facts do no support such a classification.
Juan Hasler in s e v e r a l publications (1958a, 1958b, 1961, 1975,
1976, 1977) invoked a q u a t r i p a r t i t e view of Nahua d i a l e c t o l o g y ,
with his Eastern branch containing both "" P i p i l "" (which f o r hira
includes Central American P i p i l and v a r i e t i e s from southern925
Veracruz) and Pochutec, among o t h e r s .","[940, 941]"
"For examples with3.2.3. Pronominal object prefixes. Transivitive verbs normally
bear also a prefix which references the object. These pronominal
object prefixes can cross reference an independent object pronoun,
noun, or noun phrase (usually with a third person prefix) or they
can signal the object directly if it is pronominal. These prefixes
are:
-nech-mits-k(i) -tech-mitsin-(k)in-me
you (singular)
him/her/it
us
you (plural)
themThe prefix -(k)in ""them"" has the lc when not preceded by another
prefix or w h e n a vowel precedes it. The k(i)~, the most frequent,
loses the vowel when preceded or followed by another vowel, but It
kepts its i_ before the elements - a h - and - e l (see section 2.2).
These function most frequently as direct objects, but also serve to
indicate indirect objects. (For more details concerning their56form, function, and what happens when direct and indirect objects
co-occur, see section 4.1.7). Some examples are:
ni-k-ida-k
I saw it
ni-k-neki
I want it
ki-neki
he wants it
you saw rae
ti-nech-ita-k
I saw you
ni-mits-ita-k
we saw you (pi.)
ti-mitsin-ita-ke-t
they saw us
tech-ita-ke-t
1 saw them
ni-kin-ita-k
There are other elements which can occupy the place of these object
prefixes, e.g. m u - 'reflexive' and ta- 'unspecified object'. When
the verb bears one of these other object-like affixes, the object
pronominal prefixes do not appear (cf. section 3.7.4.).

stops and affricates; the n. before dentals and alveopalatals sometimes varies with (g).
(8) Delabialization. The labiovelar (/kw/) loses its labialization at the end of a syllable. Some examples are:
tsak-tuk ""closed""
ni-k-ihnek ""I smelled it""(from tsakwa ""to close"")
(from ihnekwi ""to smell"")The rule is:
Rule 8) Delabialization:
before consonants./kw/ becomes/k/ finally and(9) Jc to ji before Jc, and Jc-loss. In careful speech, an underlying /k/ of roots before another Jc is maintained as such, but in
normal speech this Jc becomes h. Some examples are:
sahsah-ke-t ""they uprooted"" (from sahsak-ke-t)
tsah-ka ""lid"" (from tsakwa + -ka, where vowel
loss and delabialization have taken place prior to the application
of this rule)
However, the Jc of the 'third person singular pronominal object 1
prefix is lost before another Jc or before Jew, e.g. ni-k-kwa
(nikwa?) ""I eat it"", ni-k-kaki (nigagi?)""! hear it"". The rule is:38Rule 9) k to _h; k loss before jç: /k/ of .lexical roots
becomes h. before a consonant in normal speech; /k/ of
'third person singular pronominal object 1 prefix i s lost
before velar stops (k and kw).
(10) w-loss in - ( w ) a l . The ' d i r e c t i o n a l ' p r e f i x - ( w ) a l on
verbs occurs with the
present i f nothing precedes i t , but the w
i s lost when preceded by another prefix, for example:
wal-naka-k ""(he) remained"", n-al-naka-k "" I remained"",
t-al-naka-k ""you remained""
wal-temu ""(he) descended"", n-al-temu "" I descended""
x-al-ahsi ""find i t ! ""
The rule i s :
Rule 10) w-loss in the 'directional' prefix: w^ i s lost
from the 'directional' morpheme - ( w ) a l when preceded by
another prefix.
(11) Variation. Cuisnahuat P i p i l has occasional "" f r e e "" variat i o n in the ' i m p e r a t i v e ' morpheme x i - between χ and ch. Also, at
times Ji i s pronounced with more f r i c t i o n , approaching a v e l a r
f r i c a t i v e nearly equivalent in phonetic value to the local pronunciation of the Spanish voiceless velar f r i c a t i v e (orthographic j ) .
In both Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán, the 'diminutive'
s u f f i x - t s i n v a r i e s i r r e g u l a r l y at times with - c h i n , and i t
sometimes a t t r a c t s s t r e s s , even though i t may be the f i n a l
s y l l a b l e , rather than the penultimate as expected by the regular
stress r u l e .","[50, 51, 52]"

The paraphrastic future

probably has influenced this Pipil construction both in form and in
its high frequency of occurrence. (It should be recalled that yawi
has several shapes, (y)u(:) in faster speech, particularly when
used as an auxiliary, yaw as an intermediate form between full yawi

c l a r i f y i n g her Central vs. Peripheral division, which she considers
""fundamental"", Canger i n d i c a t e s that i t i s ""founded b a s i c a l l y on
one i s o g l o s s : the presence versus the absence of the stem f i n a l
vowel in the perfect of verbs"" (Canger 1983:30). However, she does
not believe this division to be old, no more that 500 years (Canger
1983:31). That i s , the defining f e a t u r e s of central d i a l e c t s are
not ""due to common inheritance, but rather to late influence from
one p r e s t i g i o u s and dominating d i a l e c t ; and they have had the
function precisely of unifying the dialects"" (Canger 1983:32).
In
short, ""peripheral dialects were defined negatively simply by not
having the features diagnostic f o r the Central d i a l e c t s "" (Canger
1983:28).
I w i l l examine the t r a i t s which Canger (and others before her)
have presented as support f o r placing P i p i l within her Eastern
group (part of the l a r g e r Peripheral group). While she did not
intend her c l a s s i f i c a t i o n to be understood as g e n e t i c , I w i l l
discuss the implications of her dialect t r a i t s for a genetic class i f i c a t i o n of P i p i l , showing the complications f o r any proposed927
c l o s e r c l a s s i f i c a t i o n of P i p i l with Mexican v a r i e t i e s of Nahua.

N e v e r t h e l e s s , Canger s a y s t h a t some p e r i p h e r a l d i a l e c t s have

due t o t h e g e n e r a l t e n d e n c y t o w a r d f i n a l - v o w e l l o s s i n Nahua
(Canger 1978:4). S p e c i f i c a l l y of P i p i l , based on h e r r e a d i n g of
Schultze-Jena (1935), she says:
Schultze-Jena's d e s c r i p t i o n of P i p i l (1935) gives the

through a development independent of t h a t common t o a l l
the Central d i a l e c t s (Canger 1980:76).
However, w i t h r e s p e c t t o P i p i l , t h i s c r i t e r i o n f a i l s , or b e t t e r
s a i d , the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of Schultze-Jena's data has led Canger t o
an inadequate view of Central American P i p i l . I t must be granted
t h a t t h e n a t u r e of v o w e l - l o s s d e s e r v e s s t u d y and t h a t f u r t h e r
c l a r i f i c a t i o n of C a n g e r ' s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n would be u s e f u l . Nevert h e l e s s , vowel l o s s in t h e s e verb forms appears not t o be a r e c e n t
d e v e l o p m e n t , b u t r a t h e r a very o l d one.
The most p l a u s i b l e
explanation of the v a r i a t i o n between forms without the f i n a l
vowel ( - C ( - k i ) ) and f o r m s w i t h i t (-V-k) i s t h a t t h e v o w e l ' s
p r e s e n c e , where i t o c c u r s i n P i p i l d i a l e c t s , i s due t o r e c e n t
a n a l o g i c a l changes based on p r e s e n t - t e n s e f o r m s (which a l w a y s
contain the vowel). For example forms such
as
ni-k-pix-ki928
""I had it"" ni-k-chix-ki ""I saw it"", ti-k-ihix-ki ""you hated it"",
and ni-k-u:x ""I shelled
it"" (from -piy-a, -chiy-a, -ihiy-a,
and -u:y-a, respectively) show vowel loss to be old, given that the
morphophonemic change of final and preconsonantal χ to j: is ancient
(from Proto-Nahua times, cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978) and is no
longer productive (cf. section 2.2). The explanation of a variant
form such as ni-k-piya-k (SD) ""I had it"" instead of the more
usual and older ni-k-pix-ki (C) is that the former is of recent
analogical formation (occurring with much less frequency than the
original forms without the stem-final vowel, probably based on the
class of verbs which in pipil and almost all other varieties of
Nahua does not lose the stem-final vowel in the preterite (cf.
section 2.2., 3.7.3) and by the vowel's presence in the 'present'tense forms. Actually, the class of verbs which loses the stemfinal vowel in Pipil is by far the most ample, with approximately
twice the number of members as the classes which retain the vowel.
Consequently, given that vowel loss is very old, Pipil cannot
convincingly be considered closely connected with Canger's Eastern
group (part of the larger Peripheral grouping) on the basis of this
criterion alone. This conclusion is seen with clarity when Pipil
verbs are compared with forms from Mecayapan, Veracruz (often
called ""Isthmus"" Nahua, part of Canger's Eastern dialect group),
which is incidentally the dialect many have considered most closely
related to Central American Pipil. Compare the third person singular preterite forms; note that final -Jc has become

In summary, with r e s p e c t to - C - k i or -V-k, P i p i l preserves a
s t a t e very much l i k e that found in C l a s s i c a l Nahuatl; i . e . , in
general P i p i l has undergone vowel loss in the preterite (-C-ki) in
the verb c l a s s e s which permit i t and in t h i s r e s p e c t P i p i l i s
d i s t i n c t from the Eastern d i a l e c t s (of the P e r i p h e r a l group)
which do not permit t h i s vowel loss.
A sober assessment of t h i s f a c t leaves P i p i l d i s t i n c t , but,
unfortunately, does not demonstrate that there could not have been
a closer connection between these two varieties. I f they had been
c l o s e l y r e l a t e d , Isthmus Nahua could s t i l l have undergone the
analogical restoration of the stem-final vowel ( i f that i s indeed
what happened) a f t e r P i p i l had separated. That i s , to show t h a t
the two belong together one must demonstrate shared innovations.
Since vowel loss in the 'preterite' i s apparently not shared (which
i s Canger's principal c l a s s i f i c a t o r y t r a i t ) , i f a connection i s to
be d e m o n s t r a t e d i t w i l l have t o be based on o t h e r shared
innovations. I t i s to Canger's other shared t r a i t s that I now
turn.
The other f e a t u r e s which Canger presented f o r her Eastern
dialects do not serve to prove that Pipil belongs genetically to
the group, e i t h e r . I t should be r e c a l l e d t h a t she did not intend
them to have a genetic interpretation, but i f P i p i l i s to be placed
h i s t o r i c a l l y , their weight for genetic c l a s s i f i c a t i o n needs to be
assessed.
F i r s t , P i p i l and Isthmus Nahua share the p l u r a l morpheme of
independent personal pronouns, - m e - t ( P i p i l ) / -me-h (Isthmus),
while others tend to have - t i n or -n. Nevertheless, the suffix
-me-h i s found in various other, non-Eastern dialects, such as La
Huasteca, which i s considered Central (Canger 1978:13, Hasler
1961:459). For example, Guerrero d i a l e c t s ( X a l i t l a , C o p a l i l l o ,
Z i t a l a , Acatlan, and X a l a t z a l a ) have tahwameh ""we"" (Canger
1980:96). Thus, the following forms exist for ""we"":930

This list shows that there are dialects w h i c h are not of the
Eastern group that have the -me-h / -me-t ending and that there are
Eastern (Isthmus) dialects which lack it (e.g. Boquiapan, Cupilco,
Tuxtlas, etc.).
It is very possible that - m e - h / - m e - t w a s the
original Proto-Nahua plural ending in pronouns, which would mean
that it represents a retention in those dialects that have it, not
a shared innovation. Therefore, these dialects could have retained
the trait regardless of their actual classification by simply not
having changed the prior existing form. In any case, its geographical distribution shows that this feature is not diagnostic for
the classification of Nahua dialects and has no direct relevance to
the position of Pipil.
Pipil, the Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua also share the
retention of initial
w h i c h changed to ye- in many other dialects, as in, for example, e:-t(l) ""bean"" instead of ye:-t(l). But
certain other dialects also preserve e-, e.g. La Huasteca, Jalisco,
etc., and even in Classical Nahuatl e^ varied w i t h ye. The e^ is a
retention of a Proto-Nhaua characteristic; the change of
to yeis a relatively recent innovation. Therefore, Pipil and others
could share
irrespectively of their classification (cf. Canger
1978:8).
These three, Pipil, Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua, also
share another trait, the preservation of the root-final v o w e l in
the words toto(:)nik ""hot"" and xoxo:wik ""green""; cf. CN toto:nki
and xoxo:wki (Canger 1978:8). This attribute is not diagnostic931
for the classification, either, since La Huasteca Nahua also has it
and, moreover, because it represents a retention of the original
form which could be shared without any historical connection after
the split up of Proto-Nahua. The loss of the root-final vowel
represents an innovation in the dialects which underwent it. In
any case, it is also possible that the Pipil form tutu:nk-a:yu-t
""fever"" evidences the change.
These three varieties share yet another trait; they have changed
the *tl of Proto-Nahua to _t (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978), but
this change is so natural that it very easily could have taken
place independently, as is suggested by the fact that a number of
other dialects also share this change (cf. Canger 1980:88-9).
Canger also pointed out that these three (Pipil, Sierra de
Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua) also tend to lose the absolutive suffix
after
(Canger 1978:13), but the circumstances of this loss vary
in each of the three and also, the same tendency is found in
certain other dialects, e.g. in Tlaxcala Nahua (Canger 1978:13).
In Pipil the absolutive has been lost completely with roots ending
in
but also it tends to be lost in other environments. For
example, one of its allomorphs, -ti, occurs after other consonants
(not -1) but is limited for the most part to monosyllabic forms,
save a few exceptions (see section 3.1.1). In Isthmus Nahua the
absolutive allomorph that occurs after final -1_ (i.e. -li) has
been lost only in polysyllabic nouns, while in Sierra de Puebla
Nahua it was lost in this same environment and also in monosyllabic
nouns with a long vowel. Had the loss of absolutive been historically shared, the only portion of it that one could assume to be
genetic would be the suppression of the allomorph after root-final
in polysyllabic forms — but not even this small portion of it
is useful for genetic classification, given that Tlaxcala Nahua
also shares that much of the loss.
Canger also pointed out traits shared only be Pipil and Isthmus
Nahua. These may be more important, although their significance
for genetic classification is not easily determined. Among these
she cites an Isthmus construction with nemi plus a main verb which
results in a kind of progressive: nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In
Pipil this progressive construction is composed of a clear
auxiliary verb, nemi, which means ""to be"" in other contexts.
However, the constructions meaning and function in Isthmus Nahua
varies with the local dialects. For example, García de León translates it as ""go (about) doing"" (Sp. andar haciendo) in Pajapan,
Veracruz, where he describes the construction as a ""frase verbal
continuativa"":
nemi mawiltia ""anda jugango"".","[941, 942, 943, 944, 945, 946, 947]"

4.10. Comparatives. The comparative construction in Pipil has
been borrowed in toto from Spanish, employing the loanword mas,
e.g.:
1) mas ka-tayuwa
more in-late
""later""
2) mu-manuh mas bibo. (A-33)
your-brother more smart.

4.11. Coordination. Among the kinds of complex sentences of
Pipil, it is not always easy to distinguish coordinate from subordinate structures. The description of complex sentences begins
with those which take the conjunctions which might be considered
coordinate:

ni, ni ke

It should be noted that certain kinds of relative clauses do not
exist in Pipil that are possible in English, such as those of the
form, for example, ""this is the girl whose father I know"" and ""this
is the man for whom I work"". Relativization of possessors such as
English ""the man's house who ... "" are also not found in Pipil,
since the construction is of the form ""his-house the man who"", more
similar to English ""the house of the man who"" (see example 3 of
A.14.1).","[143, 144]"

3.1.4. 'Plural'. Pluralization of nouns in Pipil is somewhat
complicated not only by the fact that there are several different
ways to form the plural, but also because some nouns take a combination of plural markers. The most common elements in plural
formations are reduplication (see below) and the suffix -t
'plural', also found in plural verb forms. Core Nahua has changed
this -t_ 'plural' to -ji or
thus Pipil is conservative in maintaining this trait. The various plural markers are now taken up
individually.
(1) -ket is the most restricted plural marker, limited to a very
few human nouns:
lamat-ket,
lah-lamat-ket
sih-siwa:t-ket
xuh-xu:ret-ket
ukich-ketold women
women
old men
males, men, husbands(2) -me-t occurs with a larger, though still very limited
number of nouns; these are also, with few exceptions, 'human'
nouns:
ahsi:1-met
nits
ah-alma-met
souls
ah-alwa: si :1-me t
constables, policemen
ehkuni-met
ladinos
lah-lamah-tsi-tsin-met, little old women
lah-lamah-chi-chin-met

(3) -wan, as indicated above (31.2.1), is the plural of w
'possession' and is limited to a few kinship terms (which are in
character 'intimately' possessed).","[64, 65]"
