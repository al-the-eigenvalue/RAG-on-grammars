"The uses of thepotential and inferential will be best illustrated by examples given
after the forms themselves have been tabulated. In a general way
the potential implies the ability to do a thing, or the possibility of
the occurrence of a certain action or condition (I CAN, COULD Go if Icare, cared to), and thus is appropriately used in the apodosis of an
unfulfilled or contrary-to-fact condition; it is also regularly employedin the expression of the negative imperative (prohibitive). The |
peculiar form of the potential (verb-stem with aorist pronoun endings)
seems in a measure to reflect its modal signification, the identity of
its stem with that of the future indicating apparently the lack of
fulfillment of the action, while the aoristic pronominal elements may
be interpreted as expressing the certainty of such fulfillment under
the expressed or implied circumstancesby the person referred to.",[164]

Some of the elements listed above as modal adverbs (§ 113, 4) might
also be considered as syntactic particles (e. g., wana, ha’ga, nakla',
which never stand at the beginning of a clause); these, however,show no tendency to be drawn into the verb-complex. Whenever
particles qualify the clause as a whole, rather than any particular
word in the clause, they tend to occupy the second place in the sentence, a tendency that, as we have seen (p. 65), causes them often
to be inserted, but not organically incorporated, into the verb
complex.

below:

as hardly to allow of an adequate rendering into English. It§ 114boas]HANDBOOK OF INDIAN LANGUAGES—TAKELMA277often does not seem to imply more than simple existence oraction unaccompanied and undisturbed. It is found often
with the scarcely translatable adverb ganga ONLY, in which
case the idea of unvaried continuance comes out rather
strongly, e. g.:
ga’-hi yaxa ganga naga’** that-indeed continually only he-said
(i. e., he always kept saying that) 24.15From ganga it differs in the fact that it is often attracted into
the verb-complex:

ganga ge’l-yaxa-hewe'haw only he-is-continually-thinking (i. ¢., he

used in all cases where an interrogative shade of meaning is

interrogative pronoun or adverb, or to the whole sentence.
Its use in indirect questions is frequent:

The use of the interrogative is often merely rhetorical, implying an emphatic negative:

VI. Adverbs and Particles (§§ 112-114)A very large number of adverbs and particles (some of them simple
tems, others transparent derivatives, while a great many others still
re quite impervious to analysis) are found in Takelma, and, particuarly the particles, seem to be of considerable importance in an idioaatically constructed sentence. A few specifically adverbial suffixesre discernible, but a large number of unanalyzable though clearly

) express the objective and genitive relations, the strong tendency
haracteristic of Takelma and other American languages to make the
ersonal pronominal affixes serve a purely formal purpose as substiutes for syntactic and local cases.
The second and perhaps somewhat more common method used to
uild up a local phrase is to prefix to the noun a pre-positive, the
oun itself appearing in the form it assumes before the addition of
he normal pronominal suffixes (Schemes II and III). Thus some of
he preceding local phrases might have been expressed as:
gwel-dana‘ under the rockhan-dana‘ through the rock
ha’“*ya-dana* around the rock
.gel-dana* in front of the rockdi'-dana*‘ behind the rock

xplanation to be inadmissible.","[246, 247]"

sgt’ tbitn I cut him (=T’ll Brobably cut him through)31If two adverbial (local) elements are used, the body-part prefix
follows that which is primarily adverbial in character; thus:
ba-ide'‘didi’niklat‘ did you stretch it out? (=ba--out +de-lip,
in front + di interrogative particle + di’ntk!at‘ you stretched it)
In general it may be said that instances of a body-part prefix preceding a primarily adverbial element (like ba-i-, ba°-, he*‘-, and others)
are rare or entirely lacking.
From what has been said it might seem 1 that the connective and
modal elements (like yaza,mi’“wa, and di) are more closely associated
with the verb form than are the other elements, yet this is only
apparently the case. Properly speaking all these modal elements are
post-positives that normally attach themselves to the first word of3045°—Bull. 40, pt 2—12—5§ 3466BUREAUOF AMERICANETHNOLOGY[BULL.40the sentence, no matter what part the word plays in the sentence.
Thus in a form like me’*-di-giniga‘t‘ DID YoU COME? (= me‘- HITHER +
di- interrogative particle + giniga‘t’ You WENT TO), the modal (inter-rogative) element di regularly stands nearest the verb; but as soon as
another word is introduced before the verb, the interrogative particle
shoves back a step, and we have a form of sentence like, e. g., hoida’'s
di me’‘giniga‘t’ DID YOU COME AS SINGER, i. e., TO sinc? From thisit becomes fairly evident that the di in the first example is not properly a verbal prefix at all, but merely a post-positive particle depending upon the preceding me’‘, in the same way that, in the second
example, it depends upon the noun hoida’‘s stncER. This inference
is clinched by a form like giniga’t‘tdi pi» you ao (SOMEWHERE)!
for here the di is evidently an enclitic element, not a prefix.
In sharp contradistinction to such movability, the body-part and
adverbial prefixes occupy rigidly fixed positions before the verb;
they therefore belong to a class quite distinct from the modal particles. These latter are verbal prefixes only in so far as their postpositivetendencymayforcethemtobecomeembeddedin the.verb-complex, in which case they seem to cut loose the incorporated
object, adverbial prefix, and instrumental element from the verb.

"§ 71. CONDITIONALSConditionals differ from other subordinate forms in that they are
derived, not from the full verb-form with its subject-affix, but,if
intransitive, directly from the verb-stem; if transitive, from the verbstem with incorporated pronominal object. In other words, the conditional suffix -k‘i* gi‘) is added to the same phonetic verbal units
as appear in the inferential before the characteristic -k‘, and in the
periphrastic future before the second element -gulug’-. The phonetic
and to some extent psychologic similarity between the inferential
(e. g., dimaik’ HE EVIDENTLY STRUCK ME) and the conditional (e. g,dimazigi® Ir HE STRIKES, HAD STRUCK ME) makes it not improbable
that the latter is a derivative in -2* of the third personal subjective
form in -k‘ of the latter. The conditional, differing again from other
subordinates in this respect, shows no variation for pronominal sub
jects, the first and second personal subjective forms being periphrastically expressed by the addition to the conditional of the third per
sonal subjective of the appropriate forms of e- BE. From verb-sten
yana- Go, for example, are derived:
Singular:First person, yana’k’ié ett‘e®|Second person, yana’k‘v ett§ 71Third person, yana’k‘s®|oas]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA197Plural:

Second person, yana’k'v' ett‘p‘Impersonal: yanayaak's
The conditional is used not merely, as its name implies, to expresshe protasis of a condition, but as the general subordinate form of
realized activity; as such it may often be translated as a temporalrrelative clause, an introductory adverb or relative pronoun serving
0 give it the desired shade of meaning. Examples of its use other
han as a conditional, in the strict sense of the word, are:

you to eat (3)

plit (1) de-gi’klalzgi* (2) na‘naga’* (3) it was (3) as though fire

(1) Simple, referring to action of which, though unfulfilled, thereyet remains the possibility of fulfillment.
(2) Contrary to fact, the hypothetical activity being beyond the
possibility of fulfillment.
Both types of condition require the conditional form in the protasis,
but differ in the apodosis. The apodosis of a simple conditional sentence contains always a future form (or inferential, if the apodosis is
negative), that of a contrary-to-fact condition, a potential. Examples
of simple conditions are:

"On the otherhand, the term “incorporation,” though generally of more value as 8
classificatory label than “‘ polysynthesis,” conveys information ratheras to the treatment of a special, if important, set of concepts, than
as to the general character of the process of form-building.
If we study the manner in which the stein unites in Takelma with
derivative and grammatical elements to form the word, and the vocalic
and consonantic changes that the stem itself undergoes for gram-matical purposes, we shall hardly be able to find a tangible difference§ 25Boas]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA58in general method, however much the details may vary, between
‘Takelma and languages that have been dignified by the name “ inflectional.’”’ It is generally said, in defining inflection, that languages
of the inflectional as contrasted with those of the agglutinative typemake use of words of indivisible psychic value, in which the stem and
the various grammatical elements have entirely lost their single individualities, but have “chemically”(!) coalesced into a single form-unit; in other words, the word is not a mere mosaic of phonetic
materials, of which each is the necessary symbol of some special
concept(stem) or logical category (grammatical element).","[58, 59]"
"In support of the actual existence of this admired lack of a oneto-one correspondence between a grammatical category and its phonetic expression is often quoted the multiplicity of elements that
serve to symbolize the same concept; e. g., Lat. -i, -ae, -a, -és, -iis, all
indicate that the idea of a plurality of subjects is to be associated
with the concrete idea given by the main body of the words towhich they are attached. Furthermore, variability of the stem or
base itself is frequently adduced as a proof of its lack of even a
relative degree of individuality apart from the forms from which
by analysis it has been abstracted; e. g., German bind-, band-, bund-,bdnd-, biind-. These two characteristics are very far indeed from
constituting anything like a definition of inflection, but they are
often referred to as peculiar to it, and hence may well serve us as
approximate tests.
.
As regards the first test, we find that just such a multiplicity of
phonetic symbols for the same, or approximately the same, concept,
is characteristic of Takelma. The idea of possession of an object by
@ person or thing other than the speaker or person addressed is
expressed by -2a, -a, -da (-t‘a), +t’, or +, all of which are best rendered
by HIs, HER, ITS, THEIR (the ideas of gender and number do not
here enter as requiring grammatical expression).
Similarly, the ideaof the person speaking as subject of the action or state predicated
by the main body of the verb is expressed by the various elements
te’ (de®), -t'e* (-de*), -'n, -n, -k‘a® (-ga*), all of which are best ren-dered in English by “I.”-¢'ef is confined to the aorist of intransi-tive verbs; -t‘e* is future intransitive; -'n is aorist transitive; -n is
future transitive; and -k‘a‘ is used in all inferential forms, whethertransitive or intransitive.",[59]
"Atendency is observable to end up a sentence with the raised pitch, so
that a syllable normally provided with a falling pitch-accent may
sometimes, though by no means always, assume a raised accent, if it is
the last syllable of the sentence. The most probable explanation of
this phenomenon is that the voice of a Takelma speaker secks its
rest in a rise, not, as is the habit in English as spoken in America, ina fall.

nouns of agency should logically be treated under the denominating

xpress plurality. Altogether four distinct though genetically relatederies of possessive pronominal affixes are found, of which three are

"As in many Indian languages, the stress-accent of anyparticular word in Takelma is not so inseparably associated with any
particular syllable but that the same word, especially if consisting
of more than two syllables, may appear with the main stress-accent
now on one, now on the other syllable. In the uninterrupted flow of
the sentence it becomes often difficult to decide which syllable of a
word should be assigned the stress-accent. Often, if the word bears
no particular logical or rhythmic emphasis, one does best to regard
it as entirely without accent and as standing in a proclitic or enclitic
relation to a following or preceding word of greater emphasis. This
is naturally chiefly the case with adverbs (such as he‘ne THEN) andconjunctive particles (such as ganéhi® AND THEN; agas‘i§ AND SO, BUT
THEN); though it not infrequently happens that the major part of
a clause will thus be strung along without decided stress-accent until
some emphatic noun or verb-form is reached. Thus the following
passage occurs in one of the myths:
ganéhit dewenza 1a°lé hono® p‘ele’za‘, literally translated, And
then to-morrow (next day) it became, again they went out towar
All that precedes the main verb-form p‘ele’za' THEY WENT OUT TO
wk is relatively unimportant, and hence is hurried over without anywhere receiving marked stress.
Nevertheless a fully accented word is normally stressed on some
particular syllable; it may even happen that two forms differ
merely in the place of accent:
naga’~ida* when he said, but
naga-da’* when you said
_ The important point to observe, however, is that when a particular
syllable does receive the stress (and after all most words are normally

"In some respects Takelma is typically American, in so far as it is
possible at all to speak of typical American linguistic characteristics.
Some of the more important of these typical or at any rate widespread American traits, that are found in Takelma, are: the incorporation of the pronominal (and nominal) object in the verb; the
incorporation of the possessive pronouns in the noun; the closerassociation with the verb-form of the object than the subject; dl
inclusion of a considerable number of instrumental and local m
cations in the verb-complex; the weak development of differences
tense in the verb and of number in the verb and noun; and t
impossibility of drawing a sharp line between mode and tense.
§ 116poss]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA283Of the more special grammatical characteristics, some of which are
nearly unparalleled in those languages of North America that have
been adequately studied, are: a system of pitch-accent of fairly considerable, though probably etymologically secondary, formal significance; a strong tendency in the verb, noun, adjective, and adverb
toward the formation of dissyllabic stems with repeated vowel (e. g.,
aorist stem yowo- BE; verb-stem loho- DIE; noun mozo‘ BUZZARD;
adjective hos-d"" [plural] GzTTIna Bia; adverb olo‘m FORMERLY); &very considerable use of end reduplication, initial reduplication being
entirely absent; the employment of consonant and vowel changes as a
grammatical process; the use in verbs, nouns, and adjectives of pre-fixed elements, identical with body-part noun stems, that have reference now to parts of the body, now to purely local relations; the
complicated and often irregular modifications of a verbal base for
the formation of the most generalized tense, the aorist; the great
differentiation of pronominal schemes according to syntactic rela-tion, class of verb or noun, and tense-mode, despite the comparatively
small numberof persons(only five—two singular, two plural, andone indifferent); the entire lack in the noun and pronoun of cases
(the subjective and objective are made unnecessary by the pronominal
and nominal incorporation characteristic of the verb; the possessive,
by the formal use of possessive pronoun affixes; and the local cases,by the extended use of pre-positives and postpositions) ; the existence
in the noun of characteristic suffixes that appear only with prepositives and possessive affixes; the fair amount of distinctness that
the adjective possesses as contrasted with both verb and noun; the
use of a decimal system of numeration, tertiary or quinary in origin;and arather efficient though simple syntactic apparatus of subordinating elements and well-modulated enclitic particles. Altogether
Takelma has a great deal that is distinct and apparently even isolated
about it. Though typical in its most fundamental features, it may,
when more is known of American languages as a whole, have to
be considered a very specialized type.","[288, 289]"
"Properly speaking, then, a sentence like 1 SHALL GO, HE SAID (TO ME)
(=yana’t'e* [ga] naga’ [or nege’s't]) is rendered in Takelma by1
SHALL GO (THAT) HE DID (or HE DID TO ME), in which the quotationyana’t'e® 1 SHALL GO, or else its representative ga THAT, is incorporated as prefix in the general verb of action.

use is that it conveys the idea of motion out from the sphere

toward some definite goal (object) or not; an approximate
translation in such cases would be to, at.","[89, 90]"

My informant was Mrs. Frances Johnson, an elderly full-blood
Takelma woman. Her native place was the village of Dak‘ts/asii or
Daldani‘k‘, onJump-off-Joe creek (Dip! olis!i’lda), a northern affluentof Rogue river, her mother having come from a village on the upper
course of Cow creek (Hagwal). Despite her imperfect command of
the English language, she was found an exceptionally intelligent

study would have been far more imperfect than it necessarily must
be under even the very best of circumstances.","[13, 14]"

"Theform lobo’zadéI POUND is made intransitive by the element -ca- (hence the change
in pronominalformfromtransitive -'n to intransitive-de*), andallows of no instrumental modification; a form like 7-lobo’xade* could
hardly mean I POUND WITH THE HAND; at most it could signify
I POUND IN THE HAND. If we wish, however, to express the logical
instrument in some manner, and yet neglect to specify the object, we
must get around the difficulty by making a secondary transitive of§ 35boas]HANDBOOKOF INDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA69the intransitive in -za-. This is done by the suffixed element -gwHAVING, ATTENDED By. The grammatical object of a transitive verbin -gw- is never the logical object of the action, but always dependent
upon the comitative idea introduced by this suffix. Hence the second form is not provided with a true instrumental (wITH A PESTLE),but takes the logical instrument (nozwa‘) as a direct object, while
the 7- is best rendered by IN THE HAND; to translate literally, the
form really means I POUND HAVING A PESTLE IN THE HAND.","[74, 75]"
"When used with adjectives -t‘a hassometimes the appearance of forming the comparative or superlative;

quoted really signifies THIs Is SMALL (NOT LARGE LIKE THAT). Asa

of adequate translation into English, the closest rendering being
generally a dwelling of the voice on the corresponding English word,

§ 99. PLURAL(-f<an, -han, -k/an)As a rule, it is not considered necessary in Takelma to specify the
singularity or plurality of an object, the context generally serving to
remove the resulting ambiguity.
In this respect Takelma resemblesmany other American languages. The element -(a)n, however, is
aot infrequently employed to form a plural, but this plural is of
rather indefinite application when the noun is supplied with a third
personal possessive suffix (compareregard to -gwan).what was said above,§ 91, inThe fact that the plurality implied by the suffixmay have reference to either the object possessed or to the possessoror to both (e. g., beya’nhan HIS DAUGHTERSor THEIR DAUGHTER,THEIR DAUGHTERS) makes it very probable that we are here dealing,not with the simple idea of plurality, but rather with that of reciprocity. It is probably not accidental that the plural -(a)n agrees
phonetically with the reciprocal element -an- found in the verb.","[252, 253]"

surprising frequency, probably as frequently as in the Salish languages.
The most interesting point in connection with it is probably the fact
that the reduplicating increment follows the base, never, as in most
