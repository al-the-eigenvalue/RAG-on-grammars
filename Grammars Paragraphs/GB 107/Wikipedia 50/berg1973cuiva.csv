"Response. A section usually has two participants, the speaker and the listener who makes the
response.
The response usually is a reply to the speaker’s words or an acknowledgment of his words, by the
repetition of the speaker's words, either the complete utterance or the final portion of it. The
section-final pause (a down glide) signals the listener to provide the response. Occasionally the
listener may interrupt before the section-final pause. The speaker usually continues with what he
was saying, ignoring the interruption.
in order to signal that he is finished, the speaker repeats (Repit) the response of the listener. This
also permits a chaige of speakers so that the listener becomes the speaker.

When additional participants desire to add to a conversation, they do not do so overtly. They do
it by interjecting (Inter) a comment preceding the new section. (See 3.3 [1J.) They choose one of
the main participants, usually a relative, such as a wife, husband, brother or mother through whom
to talk. The culture decrees that only certain individuals freely converse with each other. For
example, a mother-in-law greets her son-in-law, but then she talks to him through her daughter.
Only if there is no other appropriate relative through whom she may converse, does she speak to
him directly.
if a wife wishes to participate in a conversation which her husband is having with another man or
woman she tells her husband what to say to that individual. She uses the command form jaade, ‘tell
him’. The husband repeats what she has said, omitting the command form. The second speaker then
responds to what the husband has said, ignoring the wife.
The two main speakers usually talk loud enough for all to hear and they do not face one another
but sit or stand with their backs to each other.
A response is obligatory and is one of the following:

PREFACEThis description presents the grammatical structure of the Cuiva language, two texts, and a
lexicon. The structural analysis was done according to the tagmemic model of Dr. Kenneth L, Pike:
ihe description, however, is presented in a modified terminology.
Grateful acknowledgment is made to Dr. Esther Matteson and Stephen Levinsohn of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics for their help and encouragement in the analysis.. Special thanks is
due Stephen Levinsohn for his guidance and editing of the manuscript.","[1, 2, 3, 4]"
"LEXICONThe Cuiva—English lexicon consists of the following:Main entries
a. Roots and clitics, i.e., monomorphemic elements other than affixes. Verb roots not
listed in the grammar are not included.
b. All verb stems, and certain nonverbal stems and groups, where the smaller elements
might be unrecognizable.
c. Elements that cannot be clearly or certainly analyzed into smaller elements.
Subentries
Forms derived by derivational affixation or by compounding from those of the main
entries, and idioms.
Identification of classes .
a. Root classes and verbal noun groups are identified. .
b. Verb stems, and certain nonverbal stems and groups, where the smaller elements
might be unrecognizable. Cross-references are made from the roots from which the
above items are formed to the corresponding item.
Alphabetical arrangement
The order of entries is based on the Spanish alphabet, viz. a, b, c, ch, d, e, f, h, i,2.",[88]

"Cuiva isa Guajiban language of the Hanus or plains country in the states of Vichada, Boyaca,
and Arauca in the east central portion of Colombia, South America, The Cuiva Indians live by
hunting and gathering in the jungles along the Meta, Casanare, and Capanapara Rivers and their
tributaries.
The language is spoken by an undetermined number of nomadic groups, and estimates of total
population range from several hundred to 8,060. We have had contact with five Cuiva groups or
bands: (1) the Pin Menepiwi (the Big River people), (2) the Mayaraxi (the Mayayeros), (3) the
Yarawutixi, (4) the Wapiwi, and (5) two groups of Aitowapiwi (Masiguares), All the groups are
called Cuiva by the Colombian settlers. There are very slight dialectical differences among these
groups. The Cuiva of the Tomo River (6) in Vichada are of another dialect more closely related to
Guajibo. For the general location of the above groups see the area map of the Cuiva migrations.
The Pin Menepiwi dialect is described here.
The data for this description were gathered during field work under the auspices of the Summer
Institute of Linguistics from July 1965 to December 1967 and trom July 1969 to March 1970. The
material was gathered using a monolingual approach, since there were no Cuiva who spoke Spanish.
The main informants were:
;
Waro
(1965-67)
Warawanayo
(1969-70)
Wasimo
(1965-67, 69-70)
Tabsi
(1967, 1969-70)
Sepia
(1966-67; died 1968)
;
We are grateful to all the Cuiva Indians for their acceptance of us and their persistence in helping
us to learn their language well.Many of themassisted in teaching us their language, both in their
semi-permanentvillage at Mochueloand whenwe travelled with them on the Meta and CasanareRivers.
0.2. Cuiva is described in terms of the following levels: discourse, episode, section, sentence, clausc,
group, stem, and root. Of special interest are the section and the group. The section has an
obligatory response (see Section 3.1). The group includes both word and phrase-like units.",[11]
"Yesg heit is rainy season, and it rains repeatedly, the cuthei bird is seen.)The Story of Fire.
This is a story told by Tabshi (T) to his wife, Sahueima (S}. In Cuiva,
a dialogue (narrative or conversation) requires two participants: the speaker and the responder,
or the speaker and the listener. A response to the speaker is obligatory (see Section 3). The whole
text is a discourse. Only one episode occurs in this text.
