"Negation (with the existential verb)Negation is commonly expressed with the negative particle mo and the clitic
=ba, which is always the last formative in the verb before the illocutionary
particle (see 3.13.3). Mian has an alternative way of expressing negative
polarity in the perfective only, involving an invariable form of the existential
verb:
(170) Tesinab=e
tl-im
bl-im=o=be
PN=SG.M
come.PFV-NEG
exist-NEG=PRD=DECL
‘Tesinab hasn’t come.’ [Observed]
In this example the perfective verb stem tl is inflected with -im signalling
negative polarity, followed by the existential verb bl inflected with the same
suffix, effectively yielding a double negation construction.
The exact semantic difference between this type of negation and the
negation with =ba and their respective usages are not fully clear at the
moment. However, a few observations can be made which might inform
further research. The negation with the existential verb is restricted to
perfective aspect and can only be used to express negative polarity of events
which could have happened (but did not happen) in the past. For instance, it is8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs303not allowed with future time reference. In order to say that someone will not
or does not want to come, only the ba-negation is possible:
(171) Tesinab=e=mo
tl-aamab-e=ba=be
PN=SG.M=NEG
come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL
‘Tesinab won’t/doesn’t want to come.’
Likewise negation with the existential verb is disallowed in the imperfective.
Again, the ba-negation needs to be used:
(172) Tesinab=e=mo
wen-b-e=ba=be
PN=SG.M=NEG
eat.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL
‘Tesinab isn’t eating.’8.6.7.","[328, 329]"
"The negative clitic =baTo express negation in clauses which contain a finite verb the clitic =ba is
employed. It follows the subject suffix (198). In verbs with a tense suffix in
the post-subject slot =ba follows the tense suffix (199). =Ba mostly co-occurs
with the negative clitic =mo (3.13.4):

has scope over the whole sentence, which can consist of any number of
chained clauses. On negation in clause chains, see 12.2.
To express negation in non-verbal predications =ba is also used. In this
case it follows the predicate term. This is discussed in more detail in 9.11.4.
An example is:
(200) yeye
y
asyang=ba=bo
DEM.DIST
sharp_stick=NEG=QUOT
no
‘ “No, that’s not a sharp stick.” ’ [Pig story]
Usually the negative clitic =ba co-occurs with negative =mo elsewhere in the
sentence. Within a single sentence or clause, =mo may only be expressed
once, namely on the constituent immediately preceding the verb which is
marked for negative polarity with =ba. =Ba is independent of stem aspect and
TAM morphology. The use of =ba can have an influence on which subject
marker alternant is selected (see section 8.5.2 on subject marking).","[184, 185]"

was not marked with =ba to indicate negative polarity, its meaning would be
‘he was well’. Due to the scope of negation over whole clause chains,
however, this interpretation is impossible for (9).
As the polarity specification must not change within a clause chain, two
independent sentences have to be used in order to say something like ‘He
didn’t see Asuneb, he saw Beitab’, for example:

"PolarityLike illocutionary force, positive polarity, which is unmarked, and negative

"The negative pronoun suffix -kobThe negative suffix -kob attaches to roots of the simple bound series. It always
co-occurs with the negative enclitic =ba, which is used in negated verbal

"8.6.7.5. Auxiliary-serialized verb forms plus -Vm ‘Deontic’
Deontic mood is a form of speaker-oriented modality used to express that the
situation denoted by the verb should or – if negated – must not take place.
All deontic forms of vowel-final perfective stems are serializations of a
perfective lexical verb stem and the perfective auxiliary n, which is inflected
for deontic mood with the suffix -Vm. The capital ‘V’ indicates regressive
vowel harmony. The suffix vowel always has the same quality as the first
vowel in the following subject marker (see 2.7.2 on vowel harmony in this
suffix):3108. Verb morphology(192) 

‘They are should/must build a house.’
Verbs inflected with -Vm are often found in in the protasis of conditionals (see
13.2 on adverbials). In that case the interpretation is ‘Conditional’ rather than
‘Deontic’, e.g.:

For the prohibitive, deontic verb forms followed by a hortative illocutionary
particle are used. Although the verb cannot be marked for negative polarity
with =ba ‘negation’ in the prohibitive, negation is obligatorily expressed
through the negation particle mo:
(195) fút=e=mo
fu-n-em-eb=e!

"The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):

If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:1603. Word classes and grammatical relations(202) n

"Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):
(1)klayâm

The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.

As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:

in that they can also be interpreted locally. Realis marking with -n ~ -Ø always
have scope over the whole chain because medial verbs cannot be inflected for
irrealis or deontic mood.","[507, 508]"
"Yet, despite the considerable degree of similarity between medial and final
verbs, there are principled differences between the two. Medial verbs can
neither be marked for irrealis or deontic mood nor for negative polarity. Nor
can they be inflected for hortative mood. Furthermore, medial and final verbs
do not co-occur with the same set of clitics. While the latter co-occur with
clitics indicative of illocutionary force, such as =be ‘Declarative’ and =e
‘(Content) question’, the former usually only co-occur with the medial verb
marker =a. This marker is presumably derived from the co-ordinator =a ‘and’
which is used to coordinate noun phrases, e.g. tn=a unáng=a=i
[child=and woman=and=PL.AN] ‘(the) children and women’, and which in
turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’.
As noted above, morphological markers indicating co- or disjoint subject
reference are a common feature of medial verbs in clause chaining
constructions. Medial verbs carry a marker (which may be zero), whose main
function is to indicate whether the subject of the verb in the following clause
has the same subject or a different one, but which also incorporates other
meanings, mainly temporal and aspectual ones, such as sequentiality (SEQ)
and simultaneity (SIM) of events described by the two consecutive clauses
(Stirling 1993, Roberts 1997). The following sections deal with S/R
morphology of medial verbs in Mian.",[450]
"10.2. Content questions391The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:
(20)fàb
o-fâ-n-an=e?

always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of1.3. Typological profile7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect81. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominativeaccusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There1.3. Typological profile9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational101. The language and its speakersunit. Under no circumstances can the verb be followed by an overt core noun
phrase argument.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

"PolaritySyncretism of forms across features is called ‘polarity’. In the Mian case, we
are dealing with (partial) gender polarity, i.e. for (countable) inanimates a
change in number means a change to an agreement pattern associated with a
different gender, e.g. imen ‘taro’ in the plural shows the same agreement
patterns as singular feminine nouns. The term ‘polarity’ refers to situations in
which in a “given system of two terms (grammatical features) and two
exponents, values and exponents can be inverted.” (Lecarme 2002: 110).
For a (two-class) gender system this means that any given noun has a
certain gender in the singular with concomitant agreement patterning whereas
in the plural the same noun is used with the agreement patterns of the other
gender (as used in the singular). Polarity systems have been reported for
Cushitic languages, e.g. Somali (Serzisko 1982, Saeed 1999). The agreement
pattern of the definite article in Somali are set out in table 4.7 (from Saeed
1999: 112).
Table 4.7. Definite article in Somali
Masculine
FeminineSingular
-ka
-taPlural
-ta
-ka1824. GenderIn the Somali polarity system, there are two categories, gender and number,
and two markers, -ka and -ta. Changing the value of one of the categories
causes the marker to change, whereas the marker remains the same if both
values are changed (Corbett 1991: 196). Such systems of full or genuine
polarity are comparatively scarce.
Systems of ‘partial polarity’ are less rare and can, for example, be found in
Serbo-Croat. Table 4.8 illustrates agreement patterns of the predicate
agreement marker (Corbett 1991: 197).
Table 4.8. Serbo-Croat predicate agreement markers
Singular
Masculine
Ø
Feminine
a
Neuter
oPlural
i
e
aFeminine and neuter are in a relation of partial polarity in Serbo-Croat because
the feminine singular form is identical to the neuter plural form (meaning that
agreement is marked following the pattern for the feminine singular), whereas
the neuter singular and feminine plural forms are not identical. This situation
is similar to what we find in Mian.
The important point is that the four-gender and the two-gender analysis for
Mian make profoundly different assumptions about what polarity actually is.
For the four-gender analysis, polarity is a descriptive term for a situation in
which a noun in the plural follows the agreement pattern associated with
another gender in the singular without assuming that the gender of the noun
actually changes with a change in number, thus creating a special form of
syncretism which cross-cuts features. Corbett (1991: 196) uses the term in this
sense. For Mian, this means that we analyse four genders and state that
feminine and neuter 1 are in a relation of partial polarity with each other (table
4.9).

naka ‘man’
unáng ‘woman’
imen ‘taro’
am ‘house’In Mian, as in Serbo-Croat, polarity is only partial because the feminine
singular form is identical to the neuter 1 plural form, while the neuter 1
singular form is not identical to the feminine plural form.","[207, 208]"
"Negation in non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are negated like clauses with a finite verb with the
negation clitic =ba. This attaches directly to the predicate term. Unlike verbal
predications, the negation clitic =mo, which attaches to the constituent
immediately before the predicate, cannot be used in negated non-verbal
clauses.
The following examples show negation of non-verbal predications
expressing identity (135), a property (136), and possession (137).",[400]
"389Polar questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentenceAnother way of forming a polar question is using bleka ‘or’ at the end of the
sentence. In that case, there is no illocutionary clitic. This is illustrated for a
non-verbal predication in (14), and a sentence whose predicate is a finite verb,
in which case the interrogative clitic m is commonly used (15):
(14)(15)yi=e
yi
bleka?
wound or
wound=SG.N1
‘A wound, is it a wound?’ (lit. ‘A wound, a wound, or?’) [Pig story]
m
Qwentê-b-eb=ta
hear.IPFV-DS.SIM-2SG.SBJ=MEDo-b-i
say.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJbleka?
or
‘Do you understand what I’m saying?’
(Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]
Questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end are not leading but rather neutral polar
questions that introduce the (implied) negation of the proposition as a second
alternative, which is equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered in (14)
are that the referent either is a wound or is not a wound. This is a type of polar
question because the appropriate responses are ‘yes’ or ‘no’.",[415]
"IntroductionGrammatically marked categories such as tense, mood, polarity, illocutionary
force and the like, called operators by Foley and Van Valin (1984) and Foley
and Olsen (1985), differ in the scope they have in clause chaining structures.
The final verb is usually marked for such categories whereas the medial verbs
in the same clause chain depend on some of this information. While medial
verbs encode sequentiality or simultaneity of events and switches in subject
reference, they rely on final verbs for information on temporal location, mood,
and illocutionary force of the events denoted by the medial verbs. This is
typical for co-subordinated structures, such as clause chains (Reesink 1983,
Foley and Van Valin 1984).
In this chapter, all operators that occur in final verbs in clause chaining
constructions and the scope they have over the clause chain will be examined
in some detail. The operators are ordered according to categories:
Illocutionary forcePolarity
Tense1MoodAspect
Habituality=be

=bo
=a
=e
=o ~ =e
=ba
-bio
-so
-b(H)

‘Non-hodiernal past’
‘Remote past’
‘Realis’
‘Irrealis’
‘Deontic’
‘Imperfective’
‘Inchoative imperfective’
‘Habitual’47212. Operator scope in clause chaining constructionsOf these, illocutionary force, polarity, and tense always have full scope, mood
and habituality can have full scope but do not have to, and aspect finally is a
local phenomenon that never has scope.","[497, 498]"

"Illocutionary force clitics157These are clitics which mark a non-verbal clause or a sentence (i.e. a single

‘Hortative (second person singular, second/third person

=a receive treatment under question formation in chapter 10. The hortative
clitics are described in 8.6.8.
The illocutionary clitic =bo ‘Emphatic, quotative’ has three different
functions in Mian. First, it is used to mark embedded quotatives (see 13.1).
Second, while =be just signals that an utterance is declarative, =bo can be used
to make a statement more emphatic, especially under negation, as in (196):

a medial verb form of the intransitive verb têm’/temê’ ‘have a look’, for
example:1583. Word classes and grammatical relations(197) daak-n-o=a

"EvaluationAn analysis of the Mian gender system as a two-class system makes sense of
the striking patterns of homophony in the agreement markers by treating =e
and =o as exponents of the masculine and the feminine gender, respectively.
Above, we have seen that an analysis of Mian gender in terms of masculine
and feminine gender entails that we have to accept that for animate referents
gender operates independently of number, whereas (at least) for inanimates
that allow a number opposition, a contrast in number or quantity is expressed
by means of a contrast in gender. In such a system a change in number results
in a change in gender and vice versa, conflating the categories number and
gender for these inanimate nouns.
It is my view that such an analysis should be rejected in general and in
Mian in particular because despite the patterns of homophony, gender and
number are different phenomena and should therefore be kept separate in a
synchronic description of a language. Gender is a lexical feature of a noun.
Evidence for this assumption comes from the fact that assignment can be
arbitrary and agreement is strict and consistent. Number, on the other hand, is
generally not a feature a noun is inherently specified for though there are
exceptions, for example suppletive or irregular plural stems and pluralia
tantum, such as scissors or oats in English, which are indeed lexically plural,
but rather a feature of the noun phrase as a whole in a certain context in which
it is used to denote a plural referent. It might be possible to argue that in
English most count nouns are inherently singular because the form of their
lexical entry is identical to the singular form. In Mian, however, a lexical
citation form, e.g. naka ‘man’, is unspecified for number. Only the addition of
a determiners, e.g. the articles =e or =i clarifies whether one man or more that
one is/are being referred to.
A two-gender analysis would have ramifications for the structure of the
Mian lexicon. Each of the two genders would contain both animate and
inanimate nouns and the entries for animates would differ considerably from
those for inanimates. While animate nouns can be specified for either gender
(mostly depending on sex) and then regularly have their plural marked with1844. Gender=i, some inanimates, such as imen ‘taro’, would need a feature ‘polaric’,
which indicates that the noun shows gender polarity when its number value is
changed. We cannot assume a general rule that makes all inanimates polaric
because some, such as káawa ‘steel axe’, do not show gender polarity and
therefore would have to be specified as invariant. Consequently, even a twogender analysis has to make a sub-classification within each gender, in other
words, it has to make reference to both gender and animacy to account for the
gender and number behaviour of any given noun.
In summary, the two-gender analysis is plagued by the fact that it has to
assume polarity as a principle of Mian grammar. Furthermore, it is not more
parsimonious than the four-gender analysis since it also has to acknowledge a
four-way contrast. Hence, the solution I propose for Mian is to adopt the fourgender analysis because it permits us to keep number and gender separate.
Rather than saying that a given inanimate noun, such as imen ‘taro’ is
masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, this noun is lexically
specified as neuter 1, which forces the article to be =e in the singular and =o
in the plural. In other words, the correct agreement patterns follow directly
from the lexical gender specification of the noun.","[209, 210]"
"231Focused noun phrases“[F]ocus is the most important or salient piece of information in the utterance,
as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:
(100) 

‘the husband went to sit down at pig fruits (to ambush pigs), the wife
took the mother and ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]
Focus marking with the emphatic pronoun is obligatory in alternative
questions (see 10.1.3). When there is a choice between two alternatives, each2326. The noun phraseexpressed by a noun phrase, both are in contrastive focus and emphatic
pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:
(102) kbo

SG.M-EMPHbleka
or-ta
SG.M-EMPHaning
fishdowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
eat-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’
On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):
(103) Mosbi
PN=le
SG.N2=TOP|| sm
bigeka
andBanimo
PN-ta
SG.N2-EMPHgwáab=o=be
small=PRD=DECL
‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’
This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.","[257, 258]"
"Interjections and formulaic utterancesInterjections are particles which express assent or dissent, emotional states,
and hesitation in speech. Due to the fact that interjections are usually uttered
with a marked intonation, and the difficulty of teasing apart lexical tone and
intonation, I will not mark tone on interjections. The inventory comprises:
(211) ae, ai
ayasi
ayo
ba (< baa ‘say’)
dowe
ekskyus (from Tok Pisin)
klâye
o
yait, yaiks (from Tok Pisin)
yle, yle
yeye‘yes’
‘expressing surprise or disbelief’
‘sorry (feeling regret or pity)’
‘ehm (hesitation in speech)’
‘boah man’
‘excuse me’
‘well now’
‘oh’
‘yuck’
‘well (also hesitation)’
‘no’The interjection ayo can only express regret and is not used for apologies.
I think it is plausible that ba ‘ehm’ indicating hesitation goes back to the
verb stem baa ‘say (PFV)’. As bare verb stems are commonly used as
imperatives, it is conceivable that speakers used the imperative form baa
[mbà] ‘Say (it)!’ to “order themselves” to continue speaking. Synchronically,
however, the interjection ba is not pronounced with a pharyngealized /a/.
In the eastern dialect, there are no interjections for the purpose of greeting
people. Instead whole formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following
patterns of question and answer are customary:
Arriving party says:
bo y bliba? — ‘Are you (PL) there?’
klayâm bieba? — ‘Are you well?’Customary answer:
ae, n y biobobe — ‘Yes, we are there.’
ae, klayâm blibe — ‘Yes, I am well.’Departing party says:
klayâm biebte! — ‘Stay well!’Customary answer:
klayâm one! — ‘Go well!’3.14. Grammatical relations163In the morning:
(klayâm) seba? — ‘Did you sleep (well)?’Customary answer:
(ae, klayâm) sibe — ‘(Yes,) I have

klayâm áan one! — ‘(Go to) Sleep well!’Customary anwser:
kbsa klayâm áan one! — ‘You too (go

kbo y tleba? — ‘You have come to

(ae,) y tlibe ‘(Yes,) I have come to this
place?’In the western dialect area, the form klayâmo ‘really good’ is commonly used
to say hello or bid farewell to somebody. Speakers of the eastern dialect do
not have this convention.","[188, 189]"
"1103. Word classes and grammatical relationsArticles are enclitics which also indicates the number of the noun phrase and,
in the singular, the gender of the noun. Articles are usually toneless (see
below) and receive their tonal specification from the host they encliticize to.
The forms of the article are given in table 3.2.

naka ‘man’
unáng ‘woman’
imen ‘taro’
am ‘house’The animate plural article =i is realized as =ei if it cliticizes to a word ending
in a high vowel /i/ or /u/. The following examples may suffice: /Hsnabi/
‘crocodile’ and /Hsnabi=i/ ‘(the) crocodiles’; /Lumasou/ ‘fish species’ and
/umasou=i/ ‘(the) umasou fish’, but /naka=i/ ‘(the) men’ not */naka=i/.
Consider example (60) where three nouns – each with a pronominal article
– appear as subject, object, and possessor:
(60)nakamîn=e
man=SG.Mimen=o
taro=PL.N1éil=e
pig=SG.Mwen-ha-b-e=a
eat.IPFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘While a pig was eating a man’s taro, the man…’ [Pig story]
The formatives under discussion are articles rather than overt number/gender
markers because they also indicate referentiality. The noun without the article
occurs in contexts in which the noun is used non-referentially, that is in any of
the following contexts:
--in the citation form, e.g. nakamîn ‘man, brother’, éil ‘pig’, imen ‘taro’,
sók ‘rain’, kukub ‘way, custom’.
in generic object arguments in the citation form of (some) transitive
verbs, e.g. as hakalin [wood break.IPFV.VN] ‘(activity of) breaking
wood’
in first elements in N-N compounds, e.g. wan-am [bird-house] ‘bird
blind’
in generic terms used to classify animals and plants, e.g. wan ‘bird’ in
wan tolim [bird eagle] ‘New Guinea eagle (sc. Harpyopsis
novaeguineae)’3.3. Articles-111in non-verbal predications about identity, e.g. tíl=o=be
[dog=PRD=DECL] ‘it’s a dog’
under negation, e.g. imen bl-im [taro exist-NEG] ‘there’s no taro’,
yi=ba=be [wound=NEG=DECL] ‘it’s not a wound’This suggests that the article does not behave like overt gender or noun class
markers in many Australian or Bantu languages, in which a noun either
invariably has a certain marker or invariably lacks it, but rather functions as an
article marking the noun as definite-referential or indefinite-referential but is
left out if the noun is used non-referentially. However, there is a tendency to
leave out the article if the noun is inanimate even if it is used referentially.
Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the
article to agree in gender with its noun. There is evidence that the article is on
the way of becoming a purely classificatory gender marker through the
extension of the form with article to non-referential contexts. Although the
form without article is the preferred choice under negation, as in
as bl-im [wood exist-NEG] ‘there’s no wood’, one also finds as=e bl-im
[wood=ARTICLE exist-NEG] with the same meaning. Greenberg (1978) shows
that across languages the definite article often winds up as a gender marker on
the noun after going through a grammaticalization process during which it is
increasingly used both as a definite article, meaning ‘the N’, and an indefinite
specific article, meaning ‘a specific N’ or ‘a certain N’. When the use of the
article becomes a function of the syntactic construction in which the noun
appears (e.g. negation), the original contrast between the form with article and
the form without article is lost and the distinction becomes redundant. At this
point the form with article usually starts to spread to all contexts. If this form
becomes universal in the language, the former article has become a gender
marker on the noun (Greenberg 1978: 63).
Articles can follow all nouns, i.e. common nouns, proper names, dyads,
and temporal and verbal nouns (see section 3.1). Articles can also follow finite
verbs in head-internal relative clauses and adverbial clauses. In head-internal
relative clauses (61), the article agrees in number and gender with the noun. In
adverbials (62), the article is invariably =o. Square brackets indicate clause
boundaries:

[Dimosson]
Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses are discussed in 13.2 and
13.3 under embedding.
Articles can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and follow the noun
and any adjectival modifiers. They can also follow numerals (see 6.3 for
details on modified and quantified noun phrases):
(63)tíl=e
milil=e
black=SG.M
dog=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’sm=e
big=SG.MIn (63), referentiality, number and gender are marked per article =e on the
noun and on each adjectival modifier. More common in natural discourse,
however, is to have only one article for the whole noun phrase, namely
following the rightmost modifier, for example:
(64)tíl
milil
sm=e
dog black
big=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’I analyse the article as a clitic rather than a suffix for the following reasons:
(a) Apart from nouns, articles can attach to adjectives and numerals and also
to verbs in adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses. (b) The
coordinating clitic =a (presumably a shortened form of eka ‘and’) usually
intervenes between the noun and the article in the last constituent of a
sequence of coordinate noun phrases:
(65)naka=i=a
unáng=a=i
woman=and=PL.AN
man=PL.AN=and
‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson]Articles are segmentally identical to the third person forms of the free
pronouns series, from which they are probably derived. Synchronically,
however, they differ from the pronouns in their suprasegmentals. While all
free pronoun forms are lexically specified for a high tone, articles are subject3.3. Articles113to suprasegmental phonological erosion, i.e. they are on the way to becoming
toneless. As lexical tone spreads to any toneless affixes and clitics, the
phonetic pitch value of the article depends on the lexical tone specification of
the noun (see 2.8.3.2).
I assume three stages in this grammaticalization scenario. Contemporary
Mian is moving from stage (b) to stage (c):
(66)(a) naka  (lit. ‘man he’) > (b) naka= > (c) naka-e ‘a/the man’In the first stage (a), nouns were followed by a free pronoun which was
realized as a phonologically independent word. Synchronically, articles are
generally not realized as independent phonological words anymore, although
this still happens occasionally in very old speakers (over 80 years).
In the second stage (b), the article encliticizes to the noun. Concomitantly,
suprasegmental attrition sets in.
At the final stage (c), the vocalic formative will have developed into a
toneless nominal suffix.
As the article is part of the phonological nominal word (even in very
careful speech), it is clear that the language has moved beyond the first stage.
However, one finds the pronunciations [na.ka. ] and [na.ka.] ‘a/the man’. In
the former, the article has its own high tone, in the latter it is toneless and low
tone is spread from the noun to the article. Articles which retain their own
high tone (characteristic of the second stage) and ones which are toneless
(characteristic of the third stage) occur in free variation.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
"IntroductionThis chapter deals with two different types of chaining construction, both of
which are highly frequent in Mian discourse. The first type is verb
serialization where two or more verb stems are concatenated to form a
sequence of predicates within a single clause. Within serial verb constructions,
I distinguish between core and nuclear (or ‘tight’) serializations. The second
type of chaining construction is clause chaining where two or more clauses are
chained together to form a sentence.
These two construction types have in common that they are essentially
coordinate (i.e. not subordinate or embedded) structures and that their last
constituent carries grammatical information, such as illocutionary force and
polarity, which has scope over the entire construction. This form of
dependency relation in serial verb constructions and clause chains is also
called co-subordination in the literature (Reesink 1983, Foley and Van Valin
1984). A succinct definition of co-subordination can be found in Reesink
(1983: 224-226): “[Co-subordination] refers to a process whereby two items
are coordinated into a new whole with operators applying to this new whole
rather than to one of the conjuncts.” The scope rules of operators in clause
chains will be taken up in detail in chapter 12.",[431]
"4.7. Evaluation183The two-gender analysis has to understand polarity as a grammatical
principle which allows nouns to change their gender as a means of changing
their number. This, however, has consequences for linguistic theory, which
usually assumes gender and number to be two distinct categories or features.
An evaluation of a two-gender analysis for Mian taking into account its merits
but also the theoretical issues arising when one treats polarity as a
grammatical principle is given in the next section.","[208, 209]"
"Polar questionsThe appropriate answer for a polar question is ‘yes’ or ‘no’, which are ae and
yeye in Mian, respectively. They are formed with the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a. Very rarely, one finds polar questions with =e (which is
usually used for content questions). Like all illocutionary particles (see38610. Question formation3.13.1), =a encliticizes to the immediately preceding word and forms a single
prosodic word with it. A second type of polar question ends with bleka ‘or’.
Intonationally, polar questions are characterized by a short intonational
peak and subsequent fall on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is
formed by the illocutionary particle or the final syllable of bleka ‘or’.","[411, 412]"
"8. Verb morphologyClassification of verbsVerbs can be classified according to three criteria, namely position in the
sentence, possibility of direct inflection, and finiteness. A further division in
four conjugation classes will be made in 8.4.
First, finite verbs can either be directly inflected for various TAM
categories or serialized with an auxiliary. See 8.6.1 on directly inflected verbs
and 8.6.7 on auxiliary-serialized verbs.
Second, finite verbs are either final or medial. Mian is a clause-chaining
language. Simple sentences contain one final verb, whereas complex
sentences usually consist of clauses chained together, each of which contains a
medial verb while the last clause in a given chain, which forms the end of the
sentence, terminates with a final verb. All final verbs index their subjects and
any of the object(s) that this verb has to index, and can be inflected for all
TAM categories, while medial verbs are slightly more restricted in terms of
their TAM morphology. Medial verbs cannot be inflected for irrealis or
deontic mood. Furthermore, they are never marked for polarity or
illocutionary force. Tense marking with -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal
past’ on medial verbs is possible. Medial verbs partake in the switch-reference
system of the language. They are inflected for same or different subject, i.e.
they have suffixes which mark whether or not the subject of the following
clause is the same. The same suffixes also indicate sequentiality or
simultaneity of events.
Third, verbs are either finite or non-finite. Any verb (or serial verb
construction) marked for subject is finite, any verb not marked for subject is
non-finite.
As medial verbs and their morphology are intricately linked to the
phenomenon of clause-chaining, their morphology is described in section 10.2
under clause-chaining constructions.",[270]
"IntroductionThis chapter deals with the formation of questions. Formally, there are five
different types of question in Mian. Questions can employ:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)only the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence
bleka ‘or’ at the end of the sentence, and no interrogative clitic =a
the interrogative illocutionary clitic =a at the end of the sentence and
bleka ‘or’ inside the sentence (separating two alternatives)
the interrogative illocutionary clitic =e plus an interrogative phrase with
either fàb ‘where’ or wan ‘who’
the topic clitic =leFunctionally, these can be assigned to the following types:
Types (1) and (2) are polar questions, i.e. questions for which the
appropriate answer is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
Type (3) are alternative questions, where the speaker wants a specification
of the offered alternatives, e.g. Do you want pork or fish for dinner?.
Type (4) are content questions, which are used to request information about
the who, what, when, etc. of an event or action. Content questions consist of a
proposition which is completely presupposed apart from one element, which is
the one queried (Givón 1990: 714-715). In Mian, the maximum number of
queried constituents is one. Thus, multiple constituent questions, such as
English Who did what?, are not possible.
Type (5) are topic-only questions, in which only a topic is given, as in
English What about John? or And you?. The speaker has a particular question
in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied question is.",[411]
"Subject suffixAll finite verbs obligatorily have a pronominal suffix which indexes the
subject and signals person, number, and in the third person also gender of the
subject. Having subject marking is the defining feature of finite verbs in Mian
(see 3.2).
Subject marking in final verbs differs from subject marking in medial verbs
in that there is some suffix allomorphy that subject suffixes in medial verbs
lack.
Table 8.2 below gives the forms of the subject marker for final and medial
verbs, including all allomorphs (which are only found in final verbs).
Depending on the number of syllables following the subject suffix and its
phonological context, there are three – or for first person plural four –
alternants for those subject markers which end in /b/ in final verbs. Grey areas
in the table indicate the neutralization of a gender contrast.2
In non-first person there is clear evidence for the diachronic identity of
subject suffixes on the verb and the pronoun forms: kb > -eb,  > -e,  > -o,
and b > -ib. Note the loss of tone in the bound pronominal forms.
The choice of subject suffix alternants is determined by the number of
syllables following the suffix and its phonological environment, not by the
category of the formative preceding or following the subject suffix.

in the verb form, followed by those cliticized illocutionary particles which
start with /b/, namely =be ‘declarative’, =bo ‘emphatic/quotative’, and =ble
‘Exclamative’, to avoid two /b/’s in sequence at the last syllable boundary
within the phonological word.
(52)bo
unín=o
ifu-b-eo=be/*ifubebbe
food=N2
serve.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.F.SBJ=DECL
2SG.F
‘You (F) are serving food.’The function of the subject suffix alternation is solely to avoid a clash of two
/b/’s, if they constitute the coda of the penultimate and the onset of the last
syllable of a phonological verbal word. The language does not mind
heterosyllabic b-clash in any other position within a phonological word (cf.
example (57) below).
In order to avoid b-clash, the second alternant (-ebo, -obo, -ibo) can be
used but only in forms either inflected with -n ~ Ø ‘Realis’ or -Vm ‘Deontic’:
(53)kbo
unín=o
ifa-n-ebo=be
food=N2
serve.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
2SG.M
‘You (M) served food.’Instead of ifanebobe, one can use ifaneobe with the first subject suffix
alternant. Subject suffix alternation is independent of semantics. Compare:

third alternant must be used:

unín=o

2SG.F food=N2=NEG
‘You (F) are not serving food.’The same applies if the subject suffix is followed by any illocutionary clitic
which does not start with /b/, for example the interrogative clitics =a and =e,
for example in the formulaic greeting in (58):
(58)klayâm
tl-Ø-eb=a?
very_good
come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=Q
‘Did you arrive safe and sound?’ [Observed]The third alternant also appears in all final verbs in which the subject suffix is
the last morpheme, for example, before conjunctions or subordinators like
kesoa ‘because’, otâne ‘but’, and mole ‘if’, as in (59):
(59)amît=e
tala unê-b-ib
kesoa
enter go.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ
because
opening=SG.N1
‘because they were entering the opening, …’ [Dafinau]The issue arises here as to whether /o/ in the second alternant, e.g. -ebo
‘2SG.SBJ, is really part of the subject suffix. After all, it seems to occupy the
same slot as the hesternal past suffix -so in the verb form infanebsobe
‘yesterday you served food’ in (56) above and might therefore be another
tense suffix in the post-subject slot. Under negation, however, it is obvious
that /o/ is not a tense suffix in the post-subject slot because it does not show
up, whereas the tense suffix does. Compare:
(60)ifa-n-eb=ba=be/*ifanebobabe
serve_food.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=NEG=DECL
‘You did not serve food.’(61)ifa-n-eb-so=ba=be
serve_food.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-HPST=NEG=DECL
‘Yesterday, you did not serve food.’The subject suffix -bio in the first person plural is only chosen over -uo if the
subject suffix follows the irrealis suffix:
(62)n
unín=o
dowôn’-omab-bio=be
food=N2
eat.PFV-IRR.AN.PL.SBJ-1PL.SBJ=DECL
1PL.EXCL
‘We (EXCL) want to eat food.’8.5. Argument marking265It is never used when following any of the other TAM markers in the presubject slot. Although the first plural irrealis in -bio is the usual form in
contemporary Mian, old speakers still use the first alternant for first person
plural in -uo. The following example (63) is from an account of how spirit
houses were built in former times. The speaker is well over 80 years old:
(63)tl-omab-uo=be
come.PFV-IRR.AN.PL.SBJ-1PL.SBJ=DECL
‘We would come.’ [Building a spirit house]In medial verbs, only the first alternants of the subject suffix -eb, -ob, and
-ib, are ever used. This can be explained phonologically. The second alternant
comes into play to avoid b-clash at the syllable boundary between the
penultimate and the last syllable of the verb. In medial verbs, the clitics =a
and =ta, which mark the verb as medial and which form the last syllable of the
phonological verbal word, never start with /b/. There can be no b-clash and
consequently the alternation of the subject suffix is never triggered.
In two cases, there is solely phonologically conditioned allomorphy to
avoid */ii/ or */ui/ sequences, e.g. the subject suffixes which begin in /i/, -i
‘first person singular subject’ and -ib(o) ‘second/third person plural animate
subject’, are realized as -ei and -eib(o), respectively, if they attach to a stem
ending in a high vowel /i/ or /u/, such as ki ‘align, read’ or fu ‘cook’.
Therefore, the correct forms are kieibiobe ‘I read’ and fueibbiobe
‘you(PL)/they cooked’.","[288, 289, 290, 291]"
"Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):
(18)fàb

Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.",[416]

"IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They crossreference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.",[269]
"Topic-only questionsTopic-only questions are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is given,
as in English What about John? or And you? The speaker has a particular
question in mind, and it must be obvious from the context what the implied
question is, normally something that would have been asked immediately
before about a different discourse participant or something that was
anticipated by a statement, such as I’m going. What about you? (Implied: Are
you going as well?). In Mian topic-only questions are formed by using a free
pronoun or noun phrase and the low-toned topic clitic =le. In the examples
below, possible implied questions are given in brackets. If context is lacking
the default interpretation of a topic-only question would be about the topic’s
whereabouts:
(58)bo=le?
2SG.F=TOP
‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
‘What do you want to eat?’)10.3. Topic-only questions(59)403=le?
3SG.F=TOP
‘What about Leoni?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Leoni doing?’,
‘Where is Leoni?’)
LeoniPNTopic-only questions are a special case because they do not display any of the
usual strategies to mark an utterance as a question in Mian. As can be seen
from the two examples above, there are no interrogative words nor do any
interrogative particles occur.
I assume that there are two reasons why (58) and (59) are readily
interpreted as topic-only questions though they do not bear any of the markers
typical of questions in Mian: (a) they have their own distinctive intonational
contour, namely a level high pitch on the topic marker =le which is almost as
high as the H on the preceding vowel and (b) as a matter of convention, any
utterance of the structure NP=TOP is interpreted as a topic-only question.","[428, 429]"
"61. The language and its speakersVoorhoeve’s (2005) genealogy is wider in scope. He examines the genetic
relationship of the Asmat-Kamoro, Awyu-Dumut and Ok families based on
regular sound correspondences in the daughter languages. A study of the
genetic relatedness of Oksapmin, which to date has been classified as an
isolate, and the Ok languages can be found in Loughnane and Fedden (2011).
Previous linguistic work on Mian was done by Jean Smith and Pamela
Weston of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), two missionaries who
lived in Sokamin for 15 months and in Telefomin for several years where they
worked with visiting and live-in Mian speakers (my main consultant Kasening
Milimab among them). Smith and Weston published a two-part sketch
grammar, dealing with the phonology and the morphosyntax of the language,
respectively (Smith and Weston 1974a, 1974b). Apart from this sketch, Smith
(1977) published an article on sentence structure, and Weston (1977) one on
interrogatives. Smith and Weston (n.d.-a) is a compilation of this material with
some additional information on Mian discourse. Smith and Weston (n.d.-b) is
a sizable wordlist, which comprises approximately 2,000 entries, each with a
Mian headword and Tok Pisin and English glosses. Apart from indication of
word class, the wordlist contains no further grammatical information.
Although Smith and Weston were not formally trained linguists and their
linguistic work has always been directed to the end of translating the complete
New Testament into Mian (Smith and Weston 1986), their grammar sketch,
i.e. Smith and Weston (1974a, 1974b), was invaluable as a starting point for
my own linguistic analysis of Mian.
The only other Ok language described in greater detail is Telefol. Phyllis
and Alan Healey did research on Telefol phonology (Healey 1964b), noun
phrase (Healey 1965a), clause structure (Healey 1965b), verb phrase (Healey
1965c), and clause chaining constructions (Healey 1966). In addition to that,
the Healeys published an excellent dictionary (Healey and Healey 1977).
Their findings have never been published in a single volume.
Materials on Tifal phonology can be found in Steinkraus (1963, 1969),
materials on Tifal grammar in Healey and Steinkraus (1972) and in Boush
(1975). For information on Faiwol, see Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg (1969,
1977) and Mecklenburg (1974).","[31, 32]"
"Medial verbs in utterance-final positionIt is quite a common phenomenon for Mian medial verbs to appear utterancefinally in natural discourse. However, such utterances are usually not taken to
be grammatically complete sentences (Reesink 1987: 87). Their verbs are
clearly medial and not final because they are not interpreted with respect to
the moment of speaking (as final verbs are) but rather with respect to some
subsequent event which is not mentioned but implied or understood, since it is
obvious to the addressee from the context established by the situation in which
the utterance was made (Reesink 1983: 225).
Although clause chains do not involve subordination (in the sense of
embedding) but rather co-subordination, the phenomenon under discussion
here is comparable to the widespread use of subordinate constructions as main
clauses in the world’s languages with particular semantic or discourse effects
(Evans 2007).
Note that medial verbs in utterance-final position always take the medial
verb marker =ta rather than =a. An example is provided in (124):
sít=o
fubâ-n-i=ta
(124) n
tooth=PL.N1 wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
1SG
‘I’ll brush my teeth first and then I’ll …’ [Observed]
Medial clauses as independent utterances are invariably understood as
desiderative statements about the future. Examples like (124) are abbreviated46811. Chaining constructionsversions of a full clause chain ending in a final verb inflected for irrealis. A
possible example is (125):
(125) n
1SGsít=o
tooth=PL.N1fubâ-n-i=ta
wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MEDáam
un-aamab-i=be
lie.SG.SBJ go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I’ll brush my teeth and then go to bed.’
A clause with a medial verb in final position, such as n sít=o fubâ-n-i=ta in
(124) above cannot be construed to mean: *‘I have brushed my teeth’, for
which an independent sentence has to be employed, as in (126):
(126) n
sít=o
fubâ-Ø-i-o=be
tooth=PL.N1
wash-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
1SG
‘I’ve brushed my teeth.’
In (126), the final verb fubâiobe ‘I’ve washed (it)’ is zero-marked for realis
mood. As there is no alternative temporal reference point indicated, the default
interpretation is that the action took place immediately before the moment of
speaking.
Another reason why utterance-final verbs in examples such as (124) above
should be treated as medial and not as final verbs is that the markers in the
pre-subject slot are interpreted as S/R markers. The S/R system limits the set
of available subjects for the implied event. For instance, the medial verb in
(124) fubânita is inflected with -n ‘SS.SEQ’. As the subject is first person
singular, the subject of the implied event must be coreferential. In all other
person-number combinations, -n only indicates sequentiality of events (127):
(127) funa-n-eb=ta
think.PFV-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
‘You think first and then (anybody)…’
In the next example the medial verb is marked for DS. Consequently, the
subject of the implied event must be disjoint (regardless of person and number
specification of the subject):
(128) aai=e
dowôn’-s-eb=ta
eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
water=SG.N1
‘You’ll drink water first and then someone else will…’11.6. Non-verbal clauses in clause chains469It is possible for utterance-final medial verbs to also take one of the
illocutionary particles =be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble
‘Exclamative’, =a ‘Question’, or =e ‘(Content) Question’ (which normally
only occur on final verbs) in addition to the medial verb clitic =ta. Again,
such structures are not grammatically complete utterances but imply an event
which must be readily retrievable from the linguistic or extra-linguistic
context. Examples (129) and (130) illustrate this for a declarative and an
interrogative sentence, respectively:
(129) fanin-wal=i
ancestor-PL=PL.ANwengsâng
storybaa-n-ang-ge-n-i=ta=be
say.PFV-REAL-IMMACC.SG.SBJ-say.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED=DECL

fubâ-n-eb=t=ya?
wash-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED=Q
tooth=PL.N1
‘Will you brush your teeth first?’ (Implied, e.g. ‘and then go to bed’)11.6.","[493, 494, 495]"
"IntroductionMian has four types of embedded structure. These are:
-quotative sentences
adverbial clauses
head-internal relative clauses
prenominal relative clausesThese four structures can be distinguished with respect to their syntactic
category and the structures into which they are embedded.
Quotatives are full sentences, i.e. they receive marking for illocutionary
force, e.g. =bo for quotatives, =a for embedded polar questions, =e for
embedded content questions, or =e ~ =o ‘hortative’. These are always
embedded as sentential complements of the function verb ge/ga ‘say’.
Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses display clausal syntax
but are formally marked as noun phrases, i.e. they occur with a proper subset
of the determiners which fill the determiner slot in ordinary noun phrases. It is
quite typical for Papuan languages to treat adverbials and relatives formally
the same, the functional reason for this being that both types of clause provide
background information (Foley 1986: 202).
Prenominal relative clauses are embedded within noun phrases. They do
not receive any overt marking. There is no subordinator, determiner and no
illocutionary marking.
Embedded structures are on a different syntactic level with respect to their
matrix clauses because in complex sentences, embedded clauses are skipped
by the switch reference (S/R) morphology operating in the main clause, i.e.
S/R is calculated with respect to the next clause after the embedded structure.
Verbs in simple embedded clauses are morphologically very similar to
independent sentence-final verbs, e.g. both the former and the latter can be
inflected for irrealis mood whereas medial verbs cannot. All embedded
structures can be complex themselves. They can consist of a clause chain
themselves. In such cases, the last clause has a final verb and all clauses in the
embedded chain have medial verbs with S/R morphology pertaining only to
subject tracking and to the temporal structure of the events in the embedded
clause chain. In other words, S/R morphology only tracks subjects across48613. Embeddingclauses on the same syntactic level. Subject-tracking never reaches into
embedded clauses or out of embedded clauses into the matrix clause.
Verbs in embedded quotatives are always fully independent of any
information marked on the final verb in the matrix clause. Verbs in embedded
adverbials and relative clauses are only minimally dependent on the matrix
verb in that it always has to have the same illocutionary force value. This
dependency is familiar from clause chains. Unlike medial clauses, however,
verbs in embedded adverbial and relative clauses have their own TAM value
and are independent of any negation on the matrix verb, as shown in (1).
Adverbial clauses are “impervious to denial from such following clauses”
(Haiman 1980: 142), e.g.:
(1)bomânomo
tomorrowbalubib=e
airstrip=SG.N1aai=e

tl-aamab-e=ba=be
come.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ=NEG=DECL
plane=SG.N1=NEG
‘If tomorrow the airstrip accumulates water, the plane won’t come.’
Habitual marking likewise never extends to an adverbial clause. The hitting of
cats cannot be interpreted as habitual in (2):

"VerbsAs verbs are morphologically by far the most complex word class in Mian, I
will only be concerned with the defining features at this point and only give a
few examples to illustrate the most fundamental points about verb inflection in
Mian. For a detailed treatment of the morphology of the verb the reader is
referred to chapter 8.
Loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian
verbs, but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in
a function verb construction:

do-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECLMian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and impersonal
(atransitive) verbs. Transitives can be productively derived from intransitives
and ditransitives from transitives. On basic argument structures and derived
ones, see sections 9.1 to 9.7.
Semantically, verbs refer to actions, processes, and states. Verbs fulfil the
function of the predicate of a clause.
Suprasegmentally, verbs are either unaccented, in which case they are alllow, or are lexically specified for an accent to which one of two complex tonal
melodies (either HL or LHL) is assigned. Nouns, on the other hand, are
associated with one of five tonal melodies.
Syntactically, verbs are easily identified. Mian is an SOV language.
Although there is some pragmatically motivated variability with respect to the
position of subject and object, the last word in a clause is almost always the
verb and under no circumstances can the verb be followed by any of its
arguments. Occasionally, however, one finds locative adjuncts postposed after
the verb which are adverbial modifiers of the preceding verb syntactically, but
which form their own intonational unit (see 11.2.10).
Morphologically, verbs can index their core arguments with pronominal
affixes cross-referencing subject (37) and object (38):1023. Word classes and grammatical relations(37)lo

Final verbs, i.e. verbs in independent sentences or in final clauses of clause
chains, can be inflected for various aspectual categories, e.g. -b ‘Imperfective’

‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]Medial verbs, i.e. verbs in non-final clauses in clause chains, can be inflected
for co- or disjoint reference of the subject in the succeeding clause in
combination with sequentiality or simultaneity of events. In (42), the suffix -b
‘DS.SIM’ indicates that the event described in the first clause is on-going
when the event described by the second clause takes place and that this second
clause has a different subject:

A subset of verbs, almost all of which make predications of handling or
movement, has an obligatory classificatory prefix which classifies one of the
arguments according to semantic characteristics, namely sex, form, and
function, on an absolutive basis. In (43), the object fukêt ‘smoking gourd’ is
classified as belonging to the residue class.

About half of the verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with a
perfective/imperfective contrast. The rest are trans-aspectual, i.e. they have
only one stem which is vague with respect to aspect. A few verbs are defective
and lack either a perfective or an imperfective stem. Formally distinct
perfective and imperfective stems are subject to certain inflectional
restrictions, e.g. a perfective stem cannot be directly inflected for imperfective
aspect but has to enter an auxiliary construction. Trans-aspectual stems are not
restricted in terms of their inflectional morphology.
For certain tense-aspect combinations, some verbs cannot be inflected
directly, but have to be serialized with the existential verb functioning as an
auxiliary before inflection can proceed:

‘They used to cook and eat (some kind of fruit) until now.’Two verb stems can be compounded into one phonological and grammatical
verbal word which forms a single predication denoting a single event. Verbs
also frequently appear in serial verb constructions in which only the last verb
is fully inflected and all preceding verbs are either bare verb stems or stems

consists of a description of switch reference morphology in medial verbs and a
discussion of some unexpected semantic and functional inconsistencies in
switch reference marking, which have their origin in the fact that the Mian
switch reference markers are derived from the homophonous TAM markers
used in final verbs. The scope rules of operators, such as tense, polarity and
illocutionary force, an important and often overlooked topic in clause-chaining
languages, will be taken up in chapter 12.",[447]

"10. Question formationfatnà- ‘do what?’This is an interrogative pro-verb (Hagège 2008) consisting of the interrogative
word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’. Fatnà ‘do what?’ can be inflected as a
verb and has the meaning ‘do what’:
(27)fatnà-b-eb=e?
do_what-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
‘What are you doing?’ [Observed]There is a case to be made that fatnà is best analysed as an interrogative proverb, i.e. as a single root which contains both a verbal and an interrogative
meaning. Such interrogative pro-verbs can be found in Papuan languages, e.g.
Kuot (Lindström 2002), Austronesian languages, e.g. Paamese (Crowley
1982) and Australian languages, e.g. Kayardild (Evans 1995: 371-372) and
Dyirbal (Dixon 1972). Outside the Pacific area, interrogative verbs can for
example be found in West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) (Sadock 1984: 206).
In Paamese, there is an intransitive monomorphemic interrogative verb
kosaa ‘do what’, which is not segmentable into an interrogative and a verbal
element (Crowley 1982: 159).
For Kayardild, Evans (1995: 371) analyses the pro-verb ngaakawatha ‘do
what’ as an inchoative form of the interrogative word ngaaka ‘what/who’.
Here, the pro-verb is derived from an interrogative word with the suffix
-watha which derives verbs from nominals (Evans 1995: 282).
The degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal element in
fatnà is relatively low. The interrogative word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’
can still clearly be discerned. /b/ goes to [t] before the alveolar nasal /n/. This
form of place assimilation applies across the board in Mian and is thus not
necessarily indicative of a beginning fusion between the interrogative and the
verb stem.
On the other hand, there is a semantic shift of the interrogative word fàb
from ‘where’ to ‘what’ in fatnà. Bare fàb cannot mean ‘what’, while fatnà
cannot mean ‘do where’. It contrasts with fàb na ‘do where’. As the meaning
of fàb is clearly construction-specific here, the meaning of fatnà cannot be
said to be fully transparent anymore. Also, the [t] in the interrogative verb
ftna is often elided in normal and fast speech to yield fanà ‘do what’. I
therefore analyse fatnà as an interrogative pro-verb, albeit one with a low
degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal part.
The core meaning of fatnà is ‘do what’:

‘How has he escaped me?’ [Klebein]
(lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on me?’)The last two examples also shed some light on the syntactic and
morphological behaviour of fatnà in content questions.
First, these forms function as verbs and are heads of their own clauses as
can be seen in (29), which consists of a medial clause  fatnànota and a final
clause besao mebone. This is captured in the literal translations above. Like
medial verbs, inflected fatnà is subject to the usual inflectional restrictions for
medial verbs, namely that they cannot be marked for polarity or for irrealis or
deontic mood.
Second, the bare stem fatnà can appear in shortened medial clauses under
subject identity as in (30). If the verb in the following clause has the same
subject, Mian medial verbs can be shortened to just the stem which is marked
as a medial verb by the clitic =ta (see 11.2.13).
Therefore, fatnà ‘do what’ is a morphologically and syntactically regular
verb in many respects. It can also form hortative verb forms (31) and appear in
purposive serializations (32):

"Map 1.1. The Ok languages of Papua New Guinea1.1. Mian wéng: The Mian language3Geographically, the Mianmin area is delimited by the August and May Rivers
in the west and east, respectively, and the Hindenburg Range in the south.
This area is roughly located between the 141st and 142nd degrees of longitude
and between the 4th and 5th parallels. Mianmin airstrip and the villages
Timeilmin and Temsakmin, where the data used in this description of the
language were obtained, is located at 4º 54' south and 141º 37' east.
Mian has about 1,750 speakers according to the 2000 census (Lewis 2009).
Two dialect varieties can be distinguished: West Mian (also known as
Wagarabai or Skonga)3 in and around Yapsiei, a government and Catholic
mission station about 15 km east of the border to Papua (Irian Jaya) with
approximately 350 speakers, and East Mian in the villages around Mianmin
airstrip (Timeilmin, Temsakmin, and Sokamin), in Gubil, Fiak, and Hotmin
with approximately 1,400 speakers. While the western dialect is contiguous to
several other Ok languages to the west and to the non-related Abau language
(Bailey 1975) upstream from Yapsiei, the eastern dialect is in contact with the
closely related Ok languages Telefol to the east and south and Tifal to the
southwest. Some men above 50 years of age speak or at least understand
Telefol. The map shows geographical contiguity with the Lowland Ok
language Ngalum as well but there are no traditional ties between Mian and
Ngalum speakers.
Both Mian dialects are under strong influence from English and Tok Pisin,
the local variety of Neo-Melanesian pidgin (Verhaar 1995). Although the
former is clearly the most prestigious of the two and school education and
official business is conducted in English, Tok Pisin serves as a lingua franca
throughout the area. Only old speakers (above 75 years of age) have little or
no Tok Pisin. Mian speakers are aware of the influence of these nonindigenous languages, especially their destructive influence, and some
regularly identify words and grammatical constructions which are inspired by
or calqued from either Tok Pisin or English. They describe these words and
constructions as wan wéng funin or tablasébwali wéng funin, meaning ‘Tok
Pisin thinking’ and ‘English thinking’, respectively.4 As is the case in many
parts of the world, creoles and pidgins like Tok Pisin and the languages of the
European colonizers in combination with the prestige associated with these
idioms and the inferiority associated with the tok ples, i.e. the local,
indigenous languages, endanger the future of both Mian dialects. One speaker
(a local school teacher) estimated that Mian will have vanished in favour of
Tok Pisin and English in 50 to 100 years. My impression is that the eastern
dialect is even more susceptible to this development because the speakers are
generally more educated, have better English and higher chances of finding
work outside the speech community or going to college or university where
Mian is no good as a means of communication so that they are forced to speak
Tok Pisin or English.","[28, 29]"

[Initiation rituals]
S/R markers having their origin in the TAM morphology of the language does
not seem to be a common development in New Guinea languages. Existing
theories of the origin of S/R markers in Papuan languages trace them back
either to gapping under identity, which gives rise to zero marking for SS
(Haiman 1983), or to a pronominal or deictic origin. For a condensed
summary of these theories of origin and an evaluation of their plausibility, see
Roberts (1997: 190-192). In general, homophony between aspect and S/R
markers does not seem to be well attested typologically, but see Jacobsen
(1983: 174-177) on some formal similarities of S/R and aspectual morphology
in North American languages.
Yet, the formal parallels between the Mian TAM markers in final verbs
and S/R markers in medial verbs are too striking to be coincidence and the11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining447semantics of the former make them very likely candidates for the forms from
which the latter have been derived.
The S/R marker -n originates in the homophonous realis mood marker. So
what it does is simply marking the ‘real’ status (Foley and Van Valin 1984) of
an event. As a marker in medial verbs, -n remains noncommittal with respect
to conjoint or disjoint subject reference in the verb of the reference clause with
the added complication that -n does function as a fully developed S/R marker
if the subject is first person singular.
In medial verbs, the suffix -b means ‘DS.SIM’ and in final verbs -b means
‘Imperfective’. Apart from the homophony there is also a semantic
connection. In final verbs, marking for imperfective aspect by -b indicates that
the action is on-going at the moment of speaking. In medial verbs, -b indicates
that an action is on-going when the next takes place, in other words, that the
two actions are overlapping and at least partially simultaneous. Looking at it
from the other end, an action or event which is marked as simultaneous with
the one described in the following clause is very likely to be temporally
extended (barring the case where two punctual actions occur simultaneously,
as in “(Right) as the clock struck one, the bullet hit him”).5 Hence, there is a
strong association between imperfective aspect and simultaneity of events.
Longacre (1983) argues for a two-fold ‘naturalness assumption’ in S/R
languages. By this he means an association between SS marking and
sequentiality, on the one hand, and DS marking and simultaneity, on the other.
It is the case that “[…] we can normally expect that actions in succession are
performed by the same person, while actions that overlap are performed by
different people” (p. 183).
If we follow Longacre and assume that actions which occur simultaneously
are expected to be performed by different individuals, it is not surprising that
the marker -b acquired DS as an additional meaning in medial verbs.
The suffix -n, on the other hand, which goes back to the homophonous
realis marker, generally only signals sequentiality of events but if it indicates a
S/R-related meaning, namely with first person singular subjects, it will always
be SS. Hence, even -n goes the way predicted by the naturalness assumption.
The marker -s ‘DS.SEQ’ is derived from a deictic tense category, namely
‘Remote past’, the temporal meaning would of course be sequential. Two
points are noteworthy here.
First, -s has acquired a further meaning apart from DS. It is used to express
sequentiality, DS, and a close temporal or causal relation between events. This
is in contrast to -Ø ‘DS.SEQ’, which does not have this additional meaning.
Second, it might seem counterintuitive that a S/R marker meaning ‘DS.SEQ’
should be derived from the remote past tense suffix. After all, ‘Remote past’ is
not part of the meaning -s has in medial verbs. However, only TAM suffix
occurring in final verbs that is not also used in medial verbs is44811. Chaining constructions-b(H) ‘Non-Hodiernal past’, which is (at least segmentally) homophonous with
-b ‘Imperfective’ in final verbs and ‘DS.SIM’ in medial verbs. Hence, if one
assumes that the language filled out its S/R paradigm by deriving forms from
the TAM suffixes used in final verbs, it seems that choosing -s was a
reasonable option for the language.
Finally, we have to account for the most problematic case, namely -Ø
‘DS.SEQ’. Like -n ‘(SS.)SEQ’, it always indicates event sequentiality, which is
not surprising given their common origin is the realis marker -n ~ -Ø. Unlike
-n ‘(SS.)SEQ’, however, it forces the reference clause subject to be disjoint in
reference. The semantic dissociation between the S/R markers -n and -Ø needs
an explanation because as mood markers in final verbs they are allomorphs,
both with the meaning ‘Realis’. However, the semantic dissociation in the S/R
forms is only partial. A substantial, and I would argue crucial, portion of the
meaning remains constant. Both -n and -Ø still signal sequentiality which is
associated with the ‘Realis meaning’ of the original mood marker. The
dissociation only began when the additional meaning of SS or DS filtered into
the aspect system of medial verbs. It seems quite natural that the language
would have chosen one of these two to also indicate SS and the other to also
indicate DS apart from their basic temporal meaning of sequentiality, once a
SS/DS contrast had developed elsewhere in the system.","[471, 472, 473, 474]"
"3. Word classes and grammatical relationsDirectionalsDirectionals are an important and very variable category in Mian. They can be
used as adverbs or postpositions and be directly inflected to form verbs of
motion.
All directionals primarily have spatial meaning and denote locations or
directions. They can never be combined. The inventory consists of six items:
(145) ut~wit
daak
met
tab
wt
tm‘up(wards)’
‘down(wards)’
‘upriver, up a little’
‘downriver, down a little’
‘across (a river or valley)’
‘sideways, to the side (on same level)’Mian directionals are intimately linked to the topographical environment in
which the speakers of the language live. Figure 3.1 illustrates the basic
meanings of the directionals in relation to the topographical environment.utmet
tm
tab
tmdaakRIVERFigure 3.1. Mian directionals and the topographic environmentwt3.8. Directionals141The two main axes of orientation are (a) ground elevation, i.e. ut ‘up’ vs. daak
‘down’ and (b) the rivers Hak and Sek, which run roughly parallel to each
other near Mianmin, i.e. met ‘upriver’ vs. tab ‘downriver’.
Directionals are also employed in small(er)-scale environments, in which
the directionals met ‘upriver’ and tab ‘downriver’ are not used with reference
to a river as a landmark but rather mean ‘up (a little)’ and ‘down (a little)’,
respectively.
Locations around the upper part of the human body are commonly referred
to as ut, e.g. kwel ut [neck up] ‘up at the neck’, and locations around the lower
part as tab, e.g. kakam tab [buttocks down] ‘down at the buttocks’. However,
more systematic research in spatial deixis is needed for reliable
generalizations about the use of directionals in small-scale reference frames.
Directionals are used for all locations inside and outside of the Mianmin
area. Selected example are: ut - Sokamin; daak - Oksapmin, Tabubil, Fiak,
Lae, and Germany; met - Tifalmin; tab - Gubil, Yapsiei, Hotmin, Green River;
tm - Ogisai; wt - Telefomin, Vanimo, Aitape, Port Moresby, and Australia.
Farther away locations show inter-speaker variation, for instance, one only
finds tab for Gubil, which is a six-hour walk downriver from Mianmin,
whereas the location of Germany or Australia are referred to by either daak or
wt.
Directionals can be used as postpositions and adverbially. As postpositions
they follow a noun phrase. See also 7.1. They typically cliticize to their noun
host:
(146) Skiobib tab
PN
downriver
‘downriver in Skiobib’ [Dimosson]
They can be marked with an article which agrees in number and gender with
its nomnial complement. In such a configuration, the postposition does not
cliticize, e.g.:
(147) kwel
ut=o
neck(F) up=SG.F
‘up at her neck’ [Selimin]
In their adverbial use, directionals indicate that a movement event specified by
a verb of motion takes place in a certain direction. In this case, the directional
comes immediately before the verb:1423. Word classes and grammatical relations(148) Klefol=i

motion verbs.","[166, 167, 168]"
"The interrogative word wantl-Ø-eb-bu=e?
come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-GPST=CQThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:10.2. Content questions(44)lewan=e

The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.

‘What is your (M) name?’ (lit. ‘As for your (M) name, who
[are] you (M)?’)Like fàb ‘where’, the interrogative word wan plus an emphatic pronoun can
also be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier. In adnominal position it
means ‘which’:10.2. Content questions(54)naka=i

There is one case where the interrogative phrase seemingly does not appear in
situ. Consider the two semantically more or less equivalent utterances. In both
(55) and (56), the speaker wants to know who broke the cup (|| indicates an
intonational break):

Compare constituent order in these two examples and also consider the order
in the possible declarative answer in (57), which is parallel in structure to
example (55):
(57)Milsen=ekàb=e
cup(TP)=SG.N1
‘Milsen has smashed the cup.’

The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is
marked for interrogative illocution, whereas (56), on the other hand, does not
consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le
‘he who broke the cup’, which is marked as a topic with =le, followed by a

‘After I had cooked food, I came.’
Both (84) and (85) are grammatical and mean – as far as I can tell – the same.
If the suffixes -n and -Ø in these two sentences were really concerned with
indicating S/R, example (85) should not be possible. As the subject in the
reference clause is the same as the one in the marked clause, -Ø cannot be
interpreted as ‘DS.SEQ’.
Furthermore, we find examples like:
(86)n
1SGfút=e
tobacco=SG.N1fu-n-i-bio=ta
smoke-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=MEDkbmi=e
abuk ge-n-ebo=be
yours=SG.N1 later roll.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I had smoked and later you rolled yours.’
If -n in (86) behaved like a normal S/R suffix it would have to indicate same
subject and event sequentiality in the first person singular. Although a
different subject is following, inflection of the verb in the marked clause with
-n is allowed.
Having established the behaviour of the suffixes in the pre-subject slot in
tense-inflected medial verbs, I would like to point out that I still analyse these
forms as medial and not as final verbs. The reasons for that are that they are
still overtly marked as medial with either =a or =ta and do not take
illocutionary particles, and that they obey the scope rules for medial verbs (see
chapter 12). Furthermore, medial verbs inflected with -so-nom differ from
final verbs inflected with -so in that the former need the special suffix -nom,
which does not appear in the latter. Medial verbs inflected with -bio differ
from final verbs inflected with -bio in that the former also allow -b45011. Chaining constructions‘Imperfective’ in the pre-subject slot, while in the latter the pre-subject slot
can only be filled by -n ~ -Ø ‘Realis’.","[474, 475, 476]"
"40611. Chaining constructionsThe last verb in a SVC is a fully inflected verb according to the
morphological patterns of either medial or final verbs depending on whether
the SVC is the predicate of a medial or a non-medial clause (i.e. a final clause
in a clause chain or an independent sentence). Any information on
illocutionary force, polarity, or tense invariably has scope over the whole
SVC.
An important structural distinction that is made for SVCs is at which
‘layer’ of the clause they occur. Foley and Olsen (1985) argue that verb
serialization can occur at either the nucleus or the core of the clause. The
different clause layers are distinguished by sets of operators pertaining to a
particular layer. For example, aspect operates at nucleus level and nominal
arguments at core level.
Core SVCs in Mian allow verbs to have their own objects, whereas aspect
need not be shared. A nuclear SVC, on the other hand, has just a single object,
if it is transitive. Furthermore, the aspect value of the component verbs must
not be at variance. While it is possible for either stem to be trans-aspectual, it
is impossible that one is perfective and the other imperfective. This is not a
problem in core SVCs.","[431, 432]"
"Illocutionary forceOnly final verbs can be marked for illocutionary force. The set of illocutionary
markers consists of the clitics =be ‘Declarative’, =ble ‘Exclamative’, =bo
‘Quotative, emphatic’, =a ‘Question’, =e ‘(Content) Question’, and =o ~ =e
‘Hortative’. All of these have scope over the whole clause chain, e.g.:
(1)
3SG.Mbín=o
floor=N2we-n-e=a
sweep-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MEDunín=o
fu-n-e=be
cook-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
food=N2
‘He swept the floor and then cooked food.’
In (1) the illocutionary particle =be marks the whole clause chain as
declarative. The first clause cannot be interpreted as having a different
illocutionary value, for instance, to construe it as a question: *‘Did he sweep
the floor?’ is impossible. Note though that the first clause on its own could
indeed be a question,2 provided it has the appropriate interrogative intonation:
(2)
bín=o
we-n-e=a?
floor=N2 sweep-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
3SG.M
‘Has he swept the floor?’Nonetheless, in (1) above an interrogative reading of the first clause is
impossible due to the scope of the marker of declarative illocutionary force on
the final verb.
The same holds for the illocutionary markers =ble ‘Exclamative’ in (3),
and =bo ‘Quotative, emphatic’ in (4):
(3)wan
birdtiam=i
crow=PL.ANi=e

‘ “I smashed her nose, so she died, so I put her down here”, she said
and then someone else…’ [Afoksitgabáam]
The illocutionary clitic =ble indicates that the whole of (3) is an exclamation
and =bo in (4) likewise expresses that all preceding medial clauses are
quotative, i.e. they represent what the woman said at that point in the story. On
quotatives as embedded structures, see 13.1.
Markers of interrogative and hortative illocutionary force obey the same
scope rules. In order to turn the wohle of (1) above into a question, one can
replace =be ‘Declarative’ with =a to indicate a polar question:
(5)
3SG.Mbín=o
floor=N2we-n-e=a
sweep-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MEDunín=o
fu-n-e=a?
cook-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
food=N2
‘Has he swept the floor and cooked food?’
*‘He has swept the floor, and has he cooked food?’
The verb in the medial clauses which precedes the final verb funea? ‘Has he
cooked (it)?’ is not marked as a question itself, but the scope rules for the
interrogative illocutionary clitic =a force an interpretation of the entire clause
chain as interrogative.
In clause chains in which the final verb is marked as hortative by =e ~ =o,
scope is over the whole chain as well, e.g.:47412. Operator scope in clause chaining constructions(6)deb-êt-n-i=a

‘ “I should take him and go and care for (him)!” ’
*‘ “I took him and went and should care for him!’ ” [Afoksitgabáam]Although the verbs in the medial clauses which precede the final verb
sitanano ‘I should care for’ are not marked as hortatives themselves, the scope
rules force an interpretation of all these verbs as hortative.
The illocutionary markers still have scope over the whole chain if the
subject reference changes. This is illustrated for hortative illocution in (7):
(7)alél
wifehat-wal=i
mother_child(dyad)-PL=PL.ANte-s-ib=a

‘ “Your wife and children must come first and you must see them
then let’s leave them and go!” ’ [Crows]
The domain of all markers of illocutionary force is invariably the whole
sentence, which can either be a simple sentence or a clause chain.
Illocutionary markers never have scope over other sentences apart from the
one in which they occur. Sentence boundaries are indicated by brackets in (8):

‘ “Copulating (in) there, they beget children. You too have sex with

The embedded discourse in (8) consists of two independent sentences. The
first one is itself a clause chain whose final verb is marked as quotative by
=bo. The second one is a simple sentence with a hortative verb. Only this
second sentence can be interpreted as hortative because the scope of the
hortative marker =e does not have scope into or over the preceding quotative
sentence.","[498, 499, 500, 501]"

"Alternative questions with bleka ‘or’When using an alternative question the speaker expects the addressee to
specify one of two alternatives offered rather than just say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. They
are formed with the interrogative clitic =a and do not involve a change of

conjunction bleka ‘or’ conjoins the elements denoting the alternative options
