(24)This sentence contains three Spanish loanwords: pi-v&]'grapes' (uva),[s~dkya]'watermelon' (sandfa), and [bal8*nq]'muskrne1on' (rneldnes). This and
other Jemez speakers pronounce the inverse form for the word for 'watermelon' with a
final [e] (i.e. [sqdkye]).
(27)Another consonant alternation, [kb] to [h] (in the particle [ha]), is seenhere. (See also sentences (30) and (37) below.) The question particle [h$] may have
contained an initial FhY]
in the past. Another consultant occasionally says [fi6khy&]
'how', instead of [fikhy&]. This possibility is also supported by the existence of the
interrogative word [seE$] 'who'. The word consists of /SW 'who, someone' and the
question particle, and exhibits an apparent case of L-effect. (/khY/

( 189) as well as in negative commands ( I go)-( 191). As is seen in examples ( 190) and(191), the incorporative form, when used as a negative imperative, does not occur with
any pronominal prefix. [mq] is a variant of /m@/'no, without, out o f , which is
suffixed to nouns.

There is considerable irregularity in the active verb inflection. However, most
of the transitive verbs in my data can be grouped into nine morphological classes
according to the shared inflectional patterns? Two of these, which I call G7 and G10
verbs are rather small classes, consisting of only a few verbs. One of the features24Throughout the discussion on the inflected forms, the verb classes are referred to
with the prefix 'G'(for 'group') followed by a number, e.g. 'G7','G5-3b'. The
classification and numbering of the verbs are first presented in Section 4.8.2.2, and a
subset of the data appears in Table 19.","[212, 213, 214]"

"Consonant alternations of this type are not predictable since only some
consonants which derived from certain consonants in Proto-Kiowa-Tanoan are
invoIved. Thus the words which contain these consonants must be so indicated in the
lexicon.412.5.6. Reduplication
Redupiication is used in the formation of the imperfective form of some verbs.
The entire CV syllable of a monosyllabic root or the final syllable (CV) of a
polysyllabic verb root in a compound is copied and attached to the end of the original
root. If the original syllable carries a high tone, the vowel of the reduplicated syllable is
lengthened and carries a F tone, but if it carries an underlying falling tone, the vowel of
the reduplicated syllable is short with a L tone.

[miJ 'see/pf' has'cognates in other Kiowa-Tanoan languages (Hale:1967),and it
participates in the consonantal ablaut as shown in (60a). We would expect [pfrnq] for
'Don't see it' according to the pattern in (6 l), but the correct form is [rnjind. The
consonant alternation between [m] and [p] appears only in detransitivization.","[77, 78]"
"There are still questions regarding the internal relationship of the language
family. Some linguists-for
(1967)-suggestedinstance, Irvine Davis (1959) and George Tragerthat the family had first split into Kiowa and Tanoan. Others hintedthat this might not be the case. Watkins writes that ""the label Kiowa-Tanoan reflects an
obvious cultural division rather than a linguistic one"" (1984:2).1 (See also Paul
Kroskrity ( 1993:56-57).)
It is not certain if there was any other language in the Towa sub-group. It has
been generally assumed that Pecos spoke another dialect of Towa. Harrington wrote
that Jemez and Pecos were two dialects of the Towa language:
It was also suggested that the dialects of group B be known as constituting the
Towa language, since the term tdwa, meaning ""native,"" is applied by the Jemez
and Pecos to their own language. (Harrington 1910a: 13)
However, the Jemez historian, Joe Sando, rejects this assumption: ""What few words
are known of the Pecos language sound more Tewa than Towa"" (1982: 149).","[18, 19]"
"3.10. Indefinite and interrogativeMany of the indefinite and interrogative words in Jemez are formally the same.
A word can be interpreted as an indefinite or as an interrogative depending on the type
of sentence in which it occurs and on the context of the utterance. The only differenceis that the interrogative forms are usually followed by the interrogative particle lkhY&/([h&]>.",[158]

and transitivity and which occur with pronominal prefixes. In addition to words which
denote actions and processes, most of the words which would be treated as 'adjectives'
in other languages belong to this class. (See Section 3.8 'Noun qualifiers'.)
There are two classes of verbs: transitive and intransitive. Transitive verbs are
obligatorily detransitivized (i.e. passivized) under certain syntactic conditions, and this
is reflected in the inflectional paradigm and the pronominal prefixes which they take. It
is also possible to classify verbs as active or stative. All active verbs have at least five
inflected forms, while most stative verbs have just one basic form.
Jemez verbs are quite complex phonologically. Some consonants alternate, and
tones and vowel length vary with particular inflectional categories. For this reason,.there is a greater coverage of phonological phenomena in this chapter than in the
preceding chapter on noun morphology. The discussion of verbs in this chapter centers
around three main topics: (a) stem formation (Section 4.1 through 4.4), (b) pronominal
prefixes (Section 4.6), and (c) inflection (Section 4.8).
Unless stated otherwise, the citation forms of verbs found in the text (and many
examples) of this chapter are the perfective form for active verbs and the basic form for
stative verbs. This is necessitated by the fact that the surface forms of Jemez verbs can
be very different from the underlying forms due to various phonological processes.","[162, 163]"

It should be noted that there is some variation among the speakers. The
alternations (85a), (85c), and (85e), are found in the speech of all my main consultants,
but (85b) and (85d) are observed in only one speaker. The consonants that undergo
this process are regrouped as (86) and (87) below.
46Note that some surface [h] are derived historically from /khyl,and are affected by the
:-effect rule: e.g. [h&] 'question particle' < /khy&l.Another example of the alternation
between WY/and [h] is the tense-aspect particle /khYa/.",[88]

difference is that the sentence which contains /-d%ngmeans something like 'X

/-d$khe/.",[258]
"It affects only the initial consonant of an unstressed low-tone syllable,typically in particles such as reportative @a/ and pronominal prefixes. Unlike L-effect,
it never changes the initial consonant of a verb stem or an incorporated noun stem. The
consonant alternations and examples are given in (85) below. The process changes
certain consonants to a palatal or palatalized obstruent (with the exception of [th]) and
retains the voicing of the original consonants. This process is a result of the reanalysis
of word boundaries by Jemez speakers.",[87]

L-effect may operate across a word boundary, though very rarely. Sprott(1992:38) writes that in this environment, ""speakers seem to have a great deal of
freedom as to whether to articulate the N or not."" He notes that other than across clause
boundaries and when a 'phonetically empty' prefix (i.e. a null prefix), e.g. intransitive
prefix with a third person singular S, occurs after /V, the choice is free (1992:39).
Except in the speech of one female speaker, however, L-effect in my data does not take
place if the following word begins with a consonant, whether it is a pronominal prefix,
precedes a vowel-initial pronominal
a particle, or a lexical stem (noun or verb). If /l/
prefix, N always shows up. However, this is an instance of cliticization rather than L-effect.
L-effect changes consonants of various types. The consonants resulting from
L-effect can be grouped into three types-(non-glottalized) alveolar stops, alveopalatal
affricates, and laterals.

"3.7.1. Possessive marking by benefactive prefixesThe most common way of asserting possession is by means of intransitive
benefactive preilxes.18 The intransitive benefactive prefixes are typically attached to the
copula re/ 'be' or the stative verbs of position to indicate a possessor. The possessed
objects occurring in such constructions can be animate or inanimate. The examplesentences (75) through (77) literally mean 'X (possessed object) is (lying down) for

"John-tq Mary 0-mfw6(John-agt Mary intr[3bas]-seelpsv.pf)Passivization seems to be influenced by factors such as the animacy hierarchy
and the topic of the discourse. Hale (1972: 107) suggests:
nominal concepts are ranked (from highest to lowest: human, animal,
inanimate, abstract) and that the ranking plays an important role in determining
whether a sentence will appear in the passive or the active. I suspect, on the
basis of very limited data, that the passive is preferred if the patient outranks the
actor, the active if the opposite is true.
Sprott (1992), supporting Hale's hypothesis, refines the hierarchy by including the
'topic7as an additional conditioning factor. He proposes that the topic status can be
assigned to any non-SAP ('Speech Act Participant', i.e. any third-person nominal).
While the Jemez equivalent of the sentence ""The boy hit the dog"" will normally be in
the active form with the 'boy' as the subject, the sentence could be passivized if ""the
dog is clearly the protagonist"" and receives topic status (Sprott 1992: 178).
Two morphological features are involved in passivization. First, in passive
sentences, the transitive verb is inflected according to the detransitive (i.e. passive)paradigm. (See Section 4.8.3.) The active sentence in (161a) above contains the active
perfective form [m1of the verb 'see', while the passive sentence (160) has its passive
perfective form [mf ?W&].
Second, the transitive verb takes transitive prefixes in active sentences, and
intransitive prefixes in passive sentences. (See examples (160) and (l 6 1A).) Thetransitive prefixes encode A and P, whereas the intransitive prefixes show agreement
with S only, which corresponds to P of the active clause. Thus passivization, as
reflected in the pronominal prefixes, has the effect of reducing the number of arguments
by one.
Similarly, the transitive benefactive prefixes (3 arguments) occur in active
transitive sentences, while the intransitive benefactive prefixes (2 arguments) are used
in passive sentences along with the passive form of verbs. The passivization of verbs
with benefactive prefixes depends on the person of A and B. (For the detailed
discussion of the benefactive, see Section 4.6.) Passivization must take place if A is
third person, and B is either first person or second person. However, passivization is
not allowed when A is first person or second person. P does not play any roIe here
although it shows agreement in the second part of the verbal prefix. Example (164) is
in the passive voice since A is third person and B is first person.

shown in (165) through (169). These examples illustrate clauses with a B argument,
either as possessor of P of a transitive verb or as the beneficiary of a transitive event.
Whenever A is third-person and B is first-person or second-person, an intransitive
benefactive prefix is attached to the passive form of the verb, as in the (b) sentences
below.","[207, 208]"

4.8.5.1. Introduction
Stative verbs lack a perfective/imperfective opposition altogether, and most of
them have only one basic form. The verbs are grouped into three types on the basis of
whether they have inflected stems other than the basic one, and if they do, how many.
The first type, which consists of only three verbs in my data, have two forms (basic
and potential). The second type, which contains four stative verbs, have three (basic,
potential, incorporative). The third type is most numerous and has only the basic form.
The details of these types are pr~videdin the following sections.
Verbs in the basic form are interpreted as refening to a state or condition which
exists at the time of utterance or existed at some reference time in the past. If the
sentence does not contain any time adverb or any other tense marker, the tense is
indeterminate.

detailed description of Jemez sounds. However, its scope is limited to (classical)
phonemics: she derives the consonant and vowel phonemes by checking if particular
sounds 'contrast' in analogous environments. She overlooks the fact that some
consonants have a very limited but systematic distribution, and as a result, she comes
up with more consonant 'phonemes' than necessary.

in (18).
(19)In the original version, the initial consonant of the prefix [se-] in[t~het$-tYit?~]
is pronounced with an [h] after [to], but when checked later, the speaker
alternated between [l] and [h].
(21)The noun [p7&*]'moon' is incorporated in the verb, causing a tonechange in the verb stem. In the recorded version, the speaker inserted [fiini]
'something, what' after [d&] as she looked for the right word. [IQpala]is a loanword
from Spanish. As noted in Section 2.3.2, no native Jemez words begin with [l].

only in pronominal prefixes and some particles? F tone on a long vowel in the initial
syllable varies phonetically, although a long vowel with F is predominant. For

"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis dissertation is finally finished. Its completion has been made possible by
the enduring support and assistance I received from many people.
First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my Jemez friends,
without whose help this project would have been impossible. I will always remember
their friendship and hospitality. They treated me like a family member. The people
who taught me the language were extremely patient and showed genuine enthusiasm for
their language. It was a privilege to work with them.","[6, 7]"
"discusses 'Noun Phrase', 'Verb Phrase', 'Location Phrase', and 'Time Phrase', butshe tends to describe only the sequence of words in particular phrases without giving
adequate morphological information. Like Martin (1964), her phoneme inventory is
based on the classical phonemic approach. She does not indicate tones or stress in her
phonetic transcription. In addition to the discussion of phrases, Myers provides a
vocabulary list and the transcription of three informal talks.
Laurel Watkins presented papers on aspects of Jemez phonology and verbal
morphology at linguistic conferences (Watkins 1990a & 1990b).
Robert Sprott's 1992 doctoral dissertation ""Jemez Syntax"" includesphonological and morphological analysis. Among the morpho-syntactic topics covered
are the passive and incorporation. In addition, he provides a detailed analysis of Jemez
pronominal prefixes in the framework of relational grammar. The most elaborated part
of his work is the interlinear annotation of three biblical stories, as retold in Jemez by a
Jemez man. Sprott's phoneme inventory is similar to mine, but there is a considerable'difference in our treatments of suprasegmentals. In fact, he did not undertake the
analysis of tones.
There are three instrumental studies of Jemez phonetics. Alan Bell (1992)
discusses some issues related to Jemez prosody, including tones and stress. Rebecca
Heins (1993) provides formant values for the Jemez vowel system. Heins (1994) is an
MA thesis on the stop consonants in Jernez.","[20, 21]"
"1.3.2. Linguistic data in ethnographic and other studiesSome ethnographic and historical studies contain Jemez vocabulary. Elsie
Clews Parsons conducted field work at Jemez PuebIo in 192 1 and 1922. Parsons
( 1925) is an ethnography of the Jemez and includes, among other things, a descriptionof the kinship system, ceremonial life, and personal life. The book contains many
Jemez words, some of which are now archaic and are not recognized by present-day
Jemez speakers. Parsons' phonetic transcription of Jemez words is probably the best
among the three ethnographers cited here. It marked nasalized vowels and glottalized
consonants. Her transcription of long vowels, however, is inconsistent, and she did
not mark tones at all. Although there are inaccurate transcriptions, her ethnography is
noteworthy in that it contains some phonologically and morphologically interesting
facts. (See Section 2.3.1.)
Blanche Harper (1929) contains a long vocabulary list (41 pages), arranged
according to various categories, including clans, religious terms, numbers, time terms,
directions, and relationships. She uses a modified English spelling in transcribing
3Hale mentions two classes of count nouns in his unpublished ""Notes on Jemez
Grammar."" His vocabulary list contains what appear to be mass nouns.",[22]
"4.3.1. Causative verbsJemez has a small number of lexicalized causative verbs. The language has no
productive syntactic process of causativization. The causative verbs end in [p=] and
were historically derived by compounding [pk*]'make' to other morphemes, such as
active verb roots (21), descriptive nouns (22), and nouns (23). (All the examplesbelow are perfective forms.)'fill' (gY<'be full')
'sharpen' (kai 'be sharp')
'make someone cry' ($11- 'cry')
'make someone laugh' (hf-l- 'laugh')
'anger someone' (khyQ--'angry')
'dry something' (t7kle 'dry one')
'make something wet' (p7Fyk. 'wet one')
'gather, rake' (bi 'whole thing')
'melt' (p3$ 'water')
'write' (tiY 'mark')
The causative verbs are all transitive. Contrast the transitive verbs (24a) - (27a)
with the non-causative (i.e. intransitive) counterparts in (24b)- (27b). The causative
verbs are simple transitives with two arguments, which are encoded as A and P in the
transitive prefixes. The patient (P) in the transitive sentences corresponds to the S of
the intransitive verbs.
