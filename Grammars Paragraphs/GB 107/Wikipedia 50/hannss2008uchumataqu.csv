"(Métraux 1935:106)When the negation is inflected with affirmative -pini, the meaning of ana extends to
'never', thereby reflecting the affirmative sense of -pini. Thus, -pini rules out the
basic meaning of ana. Affirmative -pini itself can be combined with declarative -cay.

'There is no totora, [there are] never [again] duck eggs.'
(Vellard 1949:151)NEGIn one instance, ana is inflected with certainty -kala (cf. 5.9) which takes a position
normally reserved for affirmative -pini since certainty -kala is a verbal and
affirmative -pini a clausal clitic.

('ku-ya tax-cay sax-r-kicay hana Kala c/'-cwna') (Vellard 1949:166)Since affirmative -pini is a more recent loan from Aymara (Porterie-Gutiérrez
1981:331f), its occurence is limited to the works of Vellard (1949-67) and Muysken
(2005) (cf. 7.2.3). In all cases, the emphasised negative expression ana-pini- precedes
the item it refers to.
So far, morphological processes have been discussed. The following will deal
with lexical processes involving negative morpheme ana. It can be combined with
indefinite pronouns in order to build negative indefinite pronouns595 (see 4.2.4). It
occurs with hek 'who' (only attested for Uhle 1894), culu or ci-culu 'something'596,
cila 'another', and the lexical expression ti suni 'this man'. Depending on the
indefinite pronoun, the resulting expression means either 'no one, nobody', 'nothing',
or 'not one'. Although negative ana can be inflected with clausal and personal clitics
(examples 46, 47), its scope is over the indefinite pronoun, i.e. an expression as e.g.
ana-pini hek means 'certainly no one' and not 'never one' (example mine). Thus, the
combination of ana and an indefinite pronoun rules out the meaning a clausal clitic
has on the negation on its own (example 47). The indefinite pronouns themselves can
take nominal or clausal clitics but in most cases they are not marked at all.",[280]
"(Uhle 1894:90)ana-pini culu xala-m
kuna-cu-cay
NEG-AFF what lama-CL=2 kill-PST2-DEC
'We [certainly] did not kill any lama.'597
(Vellard 1967:11)Since negation ana and the indefinite pronoun form one expression, they hardly ever
split up. However, on a few rare occasions this is possible and we may assume that it
is highly marked in order to express e.g. emphasis.
(48)qotsuni-pini ci waxlfaj-stani ana tox'sasm ci-cul
Uru-AFF
one village-COM NEG other
what
'The Uru have only one village (lit.: The Uru are with one village); there is
not any other.'
(Vellard 1967:18)The overwhelming majority of negative indefinite pronouns appears at the beginning
of the entire clause, in one case, it immediately precedes the verb phrase it negates,
and example (48) is the only instance where the expression occurs at the end of the
clause. Thus, we may assume that example (48) is marked twice, i.e. the negative
indefinite pronoun occurs at the end and, furthermore, it is split up.
In the last category to be discussed here, the negation ana is combined with
lexemes in order to express an antonymic relation. Since the resulting expressions are
found throughout the sources, they may be regarded as lexicalised. The following
combinations exist: ana cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not good')', ana ci cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not one
good')', ana cini 'mute (lit.: 'the one who does not speak')', and ana ep(-cic) 'orphan
(lit.: 'no father[-having]')'. At least for the paraphrastic expression ana cini 'mute'
exists a synthetic synonym which is cukcilai or chuxta, respectively (Polo 1901:473,
Muysken 2005:45).

Interrogative clauses require either a certain information (information questions) or a
positive or negative affirmation (yes / no questions). I will first deal with information
questions before turning to yes / no questions.
7.6.1 Information questions
As imperative clauses, interrogative clauses convey a low degree of certainty
expressed by the speaker and are thus not marked with declarative -coy634. Specific
markers are the interrogative pronouns themselves (cf. 4.2.5), the question marker -ta
(cf. 4.2.5.1.2), and the question bound topic marker -xwi (found only in Vellard's
data; cf. 4.2.5.1.3).

since they can be inflected with possessive -ci and subject relativiser -ni,
respectively
With respect to word order, the lexical expressions have a tendency to appear
either at the beginning of the entire clause or to precede the item they refer to,
although this happens less often Only in two cases does the negative lexical
expression follow the negated phrase (examples 53) and both clauses are predicate
clauses

of Vel lard (1949-67) and Muysken (2005) the negation is sometimes decnbed as
hana or jana, respectively This points to a fricative quality the initial sound may
have, similar to Aymara ham (ci Portene-Gutiérrez 1981 32) However, in the
majonty of all cases600, the negation is transenbed as ana and therefore, I adopted
this spelling hereA loan from Aymara

In what follows, I will describe the clause types Uchumataqu displays and the
morphological means by which they are marked. I will first discuss clausal and
personal clitics before turning to a description of clause types, including declarative,
imperative, and interrogative as well as predicate clauses. The final sections will be
concerned with the several types of complex clauses in Uchumataqu.
7.1 Clausal and personal clitics
""A clitic is a bound morpheme that functions at a phrasal or clausal level, but which
binds phonologically to some other word, known as the host."" (Payne 1997:22,
markings by the author). Clitics are not bound to a specific clause types, but are
nonetheless crucial for the analysis and interpretation of Uchumataqu clause types.
Therefore, these clitic elements will be introduced before I discuss Uchumataqu
clause types.
Uchumataqu has two sets of clitic elements: the first set consists of the clausal
clitics affirmative -pini, declarative -cay, and topic marker -ki, while the second set
comprises the personal clitics -/, -m, and -5 (first, second, and third person). Before I
describe these elements, I will discuss the ground on which they can be termed
clitics. I follow Zwicky and Pullum (1983:503ff) for this discussion. According to the
authors, six criteria establish the clitic nature of an element. These criteria will be
examined for their truth value of the Uchumataqu clitic elements.
The first criterion for clitichood is that clitics show ""a low degree of selection
with respect to their host."" (Zwicky and Pullum 1983:503). This requirement is met
by clausal clitics since they can occur on every part of speech without any restriction.

"(Vellard 1967:24)The translations offered in the sources suggest that with negation ana, affirmative
-pini is either affirmative (21) or increases its degree to 'never' (22).
(21)ana-pini sek-cay

my sister NEG-AFF come-DEC
' My sister never comes. '(Muysken 2005:28)However, the by far most common use of affirmative -pini is with adjectives or
adverbs where it marks increased degree (cf. 6.1), meaning 'much', 'many' or 'very'.

hard-AFF cry-cry-lR-DEC
'(S)he [probably] cries very hard.' 619(Vellard 1951:24)Thus, the most central meaning of Aymara -pini, namely marking affirmation, is
extended in Uchumataqu to the notion of expressing increased degree. Apart from
this, -pini occurs in the lexicalised expression of xospini 'almost' and Vellard
(1951:21) reports that cun[i] cip-pini (lit.: 'most beautiful sister') is given as a pet
name to a beloved woman. Affirmative -pini does not appear on verbs where its slot
is taken by certainty -kala (cf. 5.9). Thus, these elements occur in complementary
distribution. Only in one and not entirely certain case is affirmative -pini shortened to
-pin ', otherwise it always keeps its final vowel.
7.3 Personal clitics -l, -m, -s
The personal clitics mark person reference: -/ designates a 1 first person, -m refers to
a second person, and -5 to a third person620. They are not restricted to declarative
clauses, but also occur in interrogative clauses. However, the vast majority (76,24 %)
of them appears in declarative clauses.
Although personal clitics can appear on every part of speech, their preferred
position is on the element they refer to. In most cases, this is the subject of the matrix
clause (provided, there is a subordinate clause) and thus, a structure as in (25) is the
most common one.

"CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM191Uhle (1894) is the only one to report the use of the interrogative pronoun hek 'who'

"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS159The verb classes are structurally not distinctive, i.e. every member of every verb class
can be inflected with e.g. future tense -aki. However, the verb classes select different
nominal case markers (for further discussion, cf. chapter 4).
In sum, on the basis of their functional properties verbs are not always easily
distinguished from nouns and with respect to function we find a considerable overlap
between these categories. As has been shown for nouns and adjectives there are no
clear-cut boundaries between the several parts of speech in Uchumataqu. However, in
terms of their structural properties verbs can be set apart from other word classes by
their ability to be marked for tense, apect, and mood. These concepts are encoded
verbally and are not found on any other grammatical category in Uchumataqu.
The following table summarises what has been said about the three main grammatical
categories in Uchumataqu. Shaded areas denote overlaps between categories. Please

3.6.4 Particles and phrases
The following section deals with items that do not belong to the word classes
presented above, and no feature can be established that classifies them as a category
of their own. With one exception, to be discussed below none of these lexical items
takes particular morphological marking except for personal and clausal clitics.
Furthermore, negation ana 'no, not' is the only expression that occurs in all
documents while the remaining particles appear in only one source. Therefore, they
cannot be cross-checked and verified and thus, it remains uncertain whether the itemsUCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA160in question truly form part of the Uchumataqu lexicon and how and when they were
used Based on these considerations I will present a list of the particles found in the
sources but except for a few cases will not discuss them further Negation ana will be
presented in greater detail in chapter 6

express positive confirmation, the sources on Uchumataqu (including Vellard) agree
on that the notion 'yes' is expressed by repetition of the verb form (cf 113a and b)
(113) abkun tam

equivalent, it remains largely uncertain whether hi-lay is a regular form, under which314Uchumataqu forms alphabetically ordered Slashes denote alternative formsCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS161circumstances it could be used, and what the difference is between hi-lay and
repetition of the verb form.
Next is isu-cay 'so, that' (Vellard 1949:151), which is probably a loan from
Spanish eso 'this, that' (cf. 2.11) and thus, we do not know whether the form ka:yaca: (Uhle 1894:2) represents the original Uchumataqu expression. Furthermore, Uhle
did not specify whether this item is from Chipaya or Uchumataqu.
Likewise uncertain is the use of sipi 'when, if, as given by Polo (1901:476).
Notions of mood and modality are usually expressed by irrealis -aca (cf. 5.8.2) and
thus, the use of a presumably unbound morpheme such as sipi appears to be striking.
It is possible that the first part is a loan from Spanish si meaning 'when, if335 but in
this case, the second element *-pi remains unanalysable. I would like to point to
Cuzco Quechua where a similar phenomenon can be observed. In this dialect,
Spanish si in its meaning 'when, if is combined with -chus which itself consists of
negation and question marking -chu and Reportative -s(i) (Cusihuamân 1976:248).
The resulting form sichus is likewise translated as 'when, if (cf. Valderrama and
Escalante 1977, Hannß 2004). However, since sipi is a single instance and its second
component remains elusive nothing further can be said about it.
Another element to be discussed is somewhat exceptional to the previous ones
since wajasiki23*' 'that's why' comprises a form -siki which can be analysed as the
locative marker (cf. 4.1.1.3). The element *waja- does not occur elsewhere and we
may assume that wajasiki is lexicalised, provided it is a regular form of Uchumataqu
at all.
Finally, Uhle (1894:113, 54.1) presents two particles related to Aymara. The
expression winaya 'always' is a direct loan from Aymara337 (DeLucca 1983:853)
while waligara, which is translated by Uhle as 'like'338, comprises the form wali
meaning 'well' or 'much' (DeLucca 1983:444). The form wali itself is used as an
adverb in Uchumataqu (cf. 6.1.4) but the element *-gara cannot be established for
neither Aymara nor Uchumataqu. The notion of comparative 'like' is expressed in
Aymara by the bound grammatical morpheme -jama (DeLucca 1983:606), whereas
Uchumataqu uses separative -kistana. Therefore, the form waligara remains largely
unanalysable. The remaining forms do not show any peculiarities or relations to other
bound or free morphemes.
In what follows, I do not interpret the term 'phrase' in its syntactic sense but
rather in a pragmatic way, i.e. as a fixed expression that serves in daily
communication. As such, these phrases form a closed set. They are not a part of
speech as are e.g. adjectives but neither do they belong to a particular clause type (cf.
chapter 7) for they are fixed and do not allow much morphological or syntactic
variation. Therefore, these expressions are treated as a final remark on the parts of
speech Uchumataqu comprises.
The majority of these phrases comes from Vellard (1949, 1951) and is thus
subject to the same source-related restrictions as are particles. Some of the phrases
It can also mean 'yes'
As a quotation, the form waja- is maintained and not adopted to the Irohito alphabet
Uhle points to this.
Likewise for not specified for its origin Uhle himself is doubtful about the meaning of waligara.","[175, 176, 177, 178]"

markers. However, the clause is not entirely clear.

'with two more having'(Métraux 1935:104)A lexical means to express degree (with verbs as well as with adverbs and adjectives)
is reduplication, as demonstrated in e.g. examples (7) and (28).
6.1.6 The adverbial use ofpredicator -kasi
As discussed above, manner adverbs, adverbs expressing verbal degree, and adverbs
modifying other adverbs or adjectives are close to adjectives and can therefore be
encoded with the predicator -kasi. Its use on adverbs is similar to the one on
adjectives (cf. 4.3.3) and thus, predicator -kasi appears in either attributive predicate
clauses585, as demonstrated in e.g. examples (13) and (19) or on single-word
utterances. As with adjectives, the use of predicator -kasi is not obligatory and in
most cases, it does not appear. It remains uncertain what causes the choice of either
inflection with predicator -kasi or its absence (cf. 4.3.3).
6.1.7 The adverbial use of affirmative -pini
Affirmative -pini is a loan from Aymara where it expresses affirmation (PorterieGutiérrez 1981:33If) and can be translated as 'truly' or 'for sure'. It is a clausal clitic
(cf. 7.2.3). Uchumataqu adopted these functions and affirmative -pini occurs in all
adverbial subclasses appearing regularly on adverbs expressing degree. With time
adverbs and adverbs of location and direction, we may assume that the marker
signals Affirmation, as demonstrated in example (27).

not an attributive predicate clause. No suitable explanation can be given

to Schachter (1985 20) signals the speaker's attitude towards the predication When it
occurs on manner adverbs or adverbs expressing degree, it looses this function and
becomes a mere way of increasing degree, which does not say anything about the
speaker's attitude
With respect to word order, we find four possible positions the adverb can take
In most cases, it precedes the entire clause which may be regarded as the unmarked
position (pos 1) Another common and probably equally unmarked position is
preceding the verb, adverb, or adjective it modifies (pos 2) This position is in some
cases identical to the one preceding the entire clause The adverb can also appear at
the end of the clause which is less common than its position at the beginning (pos 3)
Accordingly, the adverb occurs sometimes after the item
it modifies although it does so less often (pos 4) Again, this position is in some
cases identical to the one following the entire clause In comparison to the position
preceding the modified item or entire clause, the position following it is possibly
marked in some way although it remains uncertain why or in what way it is marked
There are only a few deviations from these positions We can only assume that
these deviations denote highly marked positions but it is impossible to provide
further explanations for the reason or meaning of these deviations
6 2 Postpositions
In most languages, the distinction between case markers and adpositions is not
discreet one and the following definition is described as a ""[r]ule of thumb"" by Payne
(1997 100) However, I would like to adopt this definition for the following section
on postpositions
Case marking is the morphosyntactic categorization of noun phrases that is
imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase occurs Adpositions
are free of such configurational constraints (Payne 1997 100)
Thus, adpositions may be seen as providing some additional semantic information on
the noun phrase they refer to and accordingly, are not required by verb semantics
Adpositions in Uchumataqu are postpositions and some morphological features
help to clarify their status as postpositions To differing degrees, they are able to
combine with morphological markers other than clausal clitics which is not possible
for case markers In one case (see below), the postposition mora 'middle' follows a
case marker and it would be highly unusual for Uchumataqu to have two case markes
on one word In most case, a noun cames only one morphological marker (cf 3 2)
Only for huntani 'on, above' do we have to refer to Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino260UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA2006:141) since the expression does not provide any hints to its status, i.e. it could be
a case marker as well. However, huntani 'on, above' can be equated with the Chipaya
postposition huni 'on, above' and thus, we may assume that huntani in Uchumataqu
is a postposition, too.
In Uchumataqu, we find four postpositions which are huntani 'on, above', kesu
'close to', mora 'middle', and kos 'inside'. Each of these will be presented below.
6.2.1 huntani 'on, above'
The postposition huntani 'on, above' does not combine with other markers except for
declarative -cay.

"6 ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS, AND NEGATION
In this chapter I will describe the adverbial subclasses as well as the postpositions of
Uchumataqu The final section will be concerned with the negation particle ana
6 1 Adverbs
Adverbs occur as modifiers of verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, ι e they are
""modifiers of constituents other than nouns"" (Schachter 1985 20) In most languages,
adverbs do not form a closed class, but rather show the same features as nouns,
adjectives, or verbs The following approach to adverbs roughly follows Schachter
(1985 20ff), ι e adverbs can be divided into three subclasses
1) verbal modifiers of time, location and direction, manner,
2) modifiers of other adverbs and adjectives expressing degree,
3) adverbs that express the speaker's attitude towards his / her predication
In what follows, the adverbial system of Uchumataqu will be discussed Adverbs in
Uchumataqu can be viewed as standing between nouns and adjectives as roughly
summarised by the following figure Thus, they do not form a closed class in
Uchumataqu

Figure 6 1 Adverbs in Uchumataqu
This is only a very general rule since exceptions occur on both sides, ι e on the
nominally as well as on the adjectivally encoded side However, the following
subclasses of adverbs can be established in Uchumataqu, which will be discussed one
by one
1 ) temporal adverbs
2) spatial adverbs
3) adverbs of manner
4) adverbs expressing degree with verbs
5) adverbs expressing degree with other adverbs or adjectives
No lexical means that signal the speaker's attitude could be established This is
possibly due to the fact that such notions are expressed by verbal suffixes, such as
urealis -oca (cf 5 8 2) or certainty -kala (cf 5 9) However, affirmative -pini seems
to express, at least in part, the speaker's attitude and will therefore be discussed at the
end of this sectionUCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA252The lists of adverbs given in what follows are by no means exhaustive but rather
include only those items that can be verified for at least two different sources, i.e.

Uhle (1894:92.1) reports a suffix -txani or -xani, which serves to build a subordinate

another conditional clause (126).

clear. Aymara has a simple past marker -ja (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:244-55, 404),
but it is unlikely that this form would be employed here. Although the element -ni is
reminiscent of the Uchumataqu Nominaliser, it seems highly improbable that it is
used here. Thus it is likely that -txani is a genuine suffix of Uchumataqu used to
express a condition.
Another special case is in Vellard (1951, 1967), where in four instances the form
-aca is translated as marking an habitual and / or a repeated action.

"(Métraux 1935:99)That puts Uchumataqu into a situation as described by Schachter (1985:12): ""[...] a
functional distinction between nouns and verbs becomes difficult to establish to the
extent that nouns occur as predicates and verbs as arguments without any distinctive
marking."". To a certain degree we find this overlap between the two categories in
Uchumataqu.
Notions typically associated with Uchumataqu verbs are tense, aspect, and mood
(cf. Schachter 1985:10), while the verbal notions voice and polarity are not marked in

'We go hunting fish in the new balsa raft.' (Vellard 1949:155)Two last criteria listed by Zwicky and Pullum (1983:504, 505) are: ""[...] no cases
where the contribution of these clitics to sentence meaning is not identical to the
conribution of their associated full forms."", and further: ""Clitics can attach to material
already containing clitics, but affixes cannot."". With respect to first criterion, the
personal clitic of second person -m is reminiscent of the personal pronoun am 'you'
and could be derived from the personal pronoun. However, apart from this, the clitic
elements of Uchumataqu do not develop from contractions of otherwise full forms
and thus, this criterion cannot be applied to Uchumataqu. With respect to the second
requirement, we find that declarative -cay and topic marker -ki are mutually exclusive
but it is well possible for declarative -cay to follow affirmative -pini (10). No
instance is found where -pini is followed by topic marker -ki. Affirmative -pini can
be also combined with personal clitics (11), although this is rather exceptional.
Among each other, the personal clitics are mutually exclusive due to the person
reference they express. No other nominal, adjectival, or verbal morpheme can follow
after a member of the sets of clitics has been attached. With that, the final criterion of
Zwicky and Pullum is fulfilled.

Attributive adjectives qualify a noun in some way. It seems that the only possible
word order for attributive adjectives is that they precede the subject (123), (124). If
this is true, the only exceptions from the regular word order appear with predicative
adjectives but not with adjectives in attributive function.

(Vellard 1949:151)In most cases attributive adjectives do not take any other morphemes (123), (124) (cf.

grammatical morphemes attached to adjectives in attributive function are the clausal

before purpose -xapa. Since the form -xapa appears almost exclusively with the
action nominaliser -5 (cf. 45), Vellard (ibid.) apparently analysed Isl (or /s/) as being
part of the morpheme and therefore considered it a verbal element. However, a
problem in Vellard's data is that the form -srapa also appears twice on nouns, i.e. on
forms that do not require a nominalising morpheme. We can only assume that
Vellard, after he had analysed the form as -srapa, decided to analyse it as such in
every context, i.e. even on nouns, as in (46).

accompaniment, it is glossed as comitative (COM); when it refers to an Instrument, it
is glossed as Instrument (INS). As an oblique case marker comitative-instrumental stani is not selected by verb semantics.

"CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION3CCVC. However, the most common forms are CV or CVC. With respect to stress we
find that Uchumataqu has a tendency to place stress on the penultimate syllable,
although this is not compulsory and there are exceptions from this, particularly when
a bisyllabic stem is inflected with a bisyllabic suffix or a mono- or bisyllabic verb is
inflected with first person singular markers -u or -a.
The elision of final vowels (or in some cases the deletion of the last syllable)
does not have morphological meaning in Uchumataqu, i.e. kuy' 'house' does not
denote a direct object or any other grammatical relation, although the full form would
be kuya. I therefore call these processes context-sensitive instead of
morphophonological. The context-sensitive processes comprise mainly final vowel
elision and to a lesser degree elision of consonants. In order to prevent elision, the
dummy elements -i and -u are used. Uchumataqu has a certain tendency towards
metathesis, which occurs with the present tense habitual marker -in that is
metathesised to -ni, related state adjectival marker -tni to -tin, and the locative
markers -kis and -fa/' and their allophones -ski and -siki which are built by metathesis
Uchumataqu distinguishes three major parts of speech, which are nouns,
adjectives and verbs. There is no morphological device that distinguishes particles as
a separate class and the only particle that occurs frequently is the negation particle
ana 'no, not'. Adverbs can be subsumed under either nouns or adjectives. The latter
are distinguished by the use of predicator -kasi and form an open class in
Uchumataqu. Morphological processes of Uchumataqu are primarily compounding,
only marginally noun incorporation and reduplication. Uchumataqu compounds
consist of a nominal head and a modifier, which can be another noun, an adjective, or
an adverb; the resulting compounds are endocentric or exocentric, although the latter
is exceptional. Compounding is a productive process in Uchumataqu and occurs
mainly with kinship terms and body parts. Noun incorporation, however, is hardly
ever used in Uchumataqu and the few examples found could be analysed differently.
Reduplication is another productive morphological process of Uchumataqu and
occurs with all parts of speech and can be partial or complete. With verbs,
reduplication mainly intensifies the meaning of the verb stem, while reduplicated
adjectives and nouns are augmentative or, in the case of nouns, express plurality.
Reduplication of grammatical material is mainly restricted to possessive marking -ci.
Although Uchumataqu is an agglutinative language, the average number of
affixes per word is low: nouns and pronouns tend to carry only one affix, while
adjectives and adverbs are often zero marked or have at best one bound morpheme.
This also holds for particles and numerals. Only verbs have a tendency to carry two
morphological morphemes, and verbs with three or four affixes attached are
exceptional. Uchumataqu differs from Aymara and Quechua by the low number of
affixes that occur on a stem.
Uchumataqu employs mainly suffixes, but it also has two prefixes, one of which
is lexicalised. The case marking system of Uchumataqu resembles that of Aymara
and Quechua with the exception of locative marking devices, where we find the
directional locative -kis (and its metathesised allomorph -ski), locative marker -ksi
(and the allomorph -siki) as well as yet another locative marker -ta. The latter
contrasts with locative -ksi I -siki since the form -ta does not occur with stative or4UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAposition verbs or in locational predicate clauses. Uchumataqu has six personal
pronouns, which also occur in possession marking and only for the first person
singular does a specially marked form exist: wist 'my'. However, it is likely that at
least the third person plural pronoun ninaka 'they' has been inspired by Aymara, with
which it shares plural marker -naka. This appears to be a recent development since
sources until Métraux (1935) still report the use of an ancient pronominal plural
marker -wici. Similar considerations could be applied to the pronoun of first person
plural exclusive wisnaka, which is clearly derived from first person singular wir 'Γ
and -naka, although no combination of wir with -wici occurs. Another peculiarity of
Uchumataqu's pronominal system is the form kun, which appears to be the pronoun
of second person singular and is preferrably applied in interrogative clauses, although
it occurs in sentence types too. Its function and meaning is not fully understood.
Uchumataqu has four postpositions, one of which, kos 'inside', can be inflected
with nominal locative marker -ta.
As in the majority of South American languages, the verbal system of
Uchumataqu is rather complex, although some of its aspects can be described only
vaguely due to the incomplete sources and the progressive attrition of Uchumataqu
reflected in them. In the verbal system the two prefixes mentioned above can be
observed. The marker s- appears to have been still productive at the time of
documentation and marks a first person singular as object. The second prefix keindicating 'return' had already been lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when Uchumataqu
was documented. However, the use of prefixes is exceptional among the Andean
languages. Uchumataqu has a tense system, which primarily distinguishes future /
non-future, although there are markers for past, present and future tense. Only a first
singular is clearly indicated in present and future tense by the markers -u and -a.
There are no bound morphemes for any other person, with the exception of In-Group
marker -acu referring to first plural inclusive, which, however, may have an aspectual
quality. Only a few aspectual suffixes are found in the sources, probably due to the
circumstances of data collection and the increasing attrition of Uchumataqu. Other
verbal markers are nominalising -ni and -s(i), two subordination markers, of which
only gerund -ku can be satisfactorily interpreted, and irrealis -aca, which fulfills
several functions, such as marking conditional or Deontic modality.
The general order of verbal affixes is that grammatical function marking affixes,
aspectual suffixes, subordinating and switch reference marking suffixes, the valence
changing suffix as well as nominalising and adjectival state marking suffixes cluster
around the verb stem. These suffixes appear to be mutually exclusive. They can be
followed by the validational suffix -kala, which is a verbal suffix. Mood, modality,
and portmanteau suffixes expressing tense and person are the last verbal suffixes to
be attached. Verbs can take one or two of the clausal clitics -pini, -ki, or -cay2, which
themselves can be followed by one of the personal clitics -/, -tn, or -s.
On a clausal level, Uchumataqu has the following clitics: declarative -cay, topic
marker -ki, and affirmative -pini3. Another peculiarity of Uchumataqu is the use of2
3Affirmative -pini and declarative -cay can be combined.

word order of declarative clauses, i.e. in the exclusive clause, negation ana is

The term complement is understood here as an argument required by the semantics of
the matrix verb. The following discussion654 will be restricted to non-finite
complement clauses since finite complement clauses in Uchumataqu have the shape
of juxtaposed matrix clauses and are thus treated under the heading of coordination
(e.g. example 81).The data suggest that Uchumataqu allows for object complements
only.
Non-finite complement clauses are built with either chain verb constructions or
action nominaliser -s(i) (cf. 5.6 and 5.7). What is called chain verb constructions here
differs from typical serial verb constructions since the chained verbs of Uchumataqu
do not denote aspects of one action or event but refer to different actions or events.
However, one action or event is usually dependent on the other. Furthermore, I would
like to point out that the data on complement clauses is limited and show little
variation with respect to the matrix verb (they are almost exclusively limited to
volition verbs). It is particularly with action nominaliser -s(i) that we lack entire
clauses in the data. This marker occurs mainly with singular items where an infinitive
is required.
Chain verb constructions are indicated by zero marking of the complement verb,
i.e. it carries neither person, tense or aspect markers nor declarative -cay.

'mosquito'(Lehmann 1929d 10)Another special case is the reduplication of grammatical material It affects nouns,
adjectives, and numerals and occurs only with possessive marking -ci It is unlikely
that reduplication of possessive -ci is lexicalised since every word bearing
reduplicated -ci has a basic, non-reduplicated form Furthermore, reduplication of -ci
is exceptional since in the majority of all cases, the marker is not reduplicated Thus,
the function of this reduplication type is not entirely clear but it is possible that it
denotes a very close and possibly inalienable kind of possession If this assumption is
true, reduplication of -ci could be considered to be augmentative in function

Examples (69) and (70) are items also used in Aymara
This onomatopoetic expression is probably a borrowingfromSpanish149CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSReduplication of possessive -ci is not restricted to body parts but can also occur with
adjectives describing characteristics and numerals

'thirteen'(Polo 1901 464)(Vellard 1951 18)The interpretation of reduplicated -ci as marking a very close relation is further
supported by its use on numerals (cf 4 4) Vellard (1951 17ff) reports the
reduplication to appear on every numeral higher than ten (cf example 76)
In conclusion, I would like to state that reduplication must have been a fairly
productive means of stem modification once, but lexicalisation has often obscured its
meaning This is particularly the case with verbs However, with adjectives, nouns,
and pronouns some regularities can be detected Adjectives mainly reduplicate their
initial syllable and due to their semantics convey only an augmentative meaning,
whereas nouns and pronouns show partial or complete reduplication In contrast to
adjectives, nominal reduplication can have the function of plurality but only with
complete reduplication
3 6 Parts of speech
According to Payne (1997 32, bold marking by the author), ""grammatical
categories are called 'parts of speech'"" or are sometimes also referred to as ""lexical
categones"" The lexical content of an Uchumataqu word is sometimes hard to grasp
due to diverging or even missing translations Therefore, I will classify Uchumataqu
categones primarily on the basis of their structural and functional properties, ι e
according to their morphosynatctic behaviour Pursuing this approach the following
parts of speech can be established nouns, adjectives, and verbs Two somewhat
special cases are particles and so-called phrases, ι e fixed expressions found in
everyday life's communication Particles do not form a word class of their own but
do not belong to another word class either Phrases, even less than particles, do not
form a grammatical category but will be treated here as a final remark on
Uchumataqu parts of speech They differ syntactically from prototypical noun or verb
phrases and clause types and thus will not be considered in chapter 7
Although it is well possible to establish three grammatical categories the
boundanes between them are not always clear-cut (cf Schachter 1985 6, Payne
1997 32) These overlaps are observed for other languages too and go as far as to
bring into question the traditional distinction between the different categories (cf
Croft 2003 183)
In what follows, I will use the terms 'grammatical category' and 'parts of
speech' alike to refer to the Uchumataqu categones Further, I would like to point out
that for the subsequent outline of the classification of Uchumataqu parts of speech, I
roughly follow Schachter (1985) and Payne (1997)UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA1503.6.1 Nouns
Notions most typically associated with nouns are time-stability (Payne 1997:33) and
referentiality (Croft 2003:185) to ""persons, places, and things"" (Schachter 1985:7),
the latter concepts considered to be prototypically encoded by nouns.
Payne (1997:33)3'5 lists as functional properties of nouns their ability to act as the
head of noun phrases, to serve as either subject or object of a clause, and to be most
commonly the topic of texts. The head of a noun phrase can be characterised as ""the
one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers
to"" (Payne 1997:33) (cf. 77).
(77)co:k lu.si
big
jar
'abigjar'(Métraux 1935:94)Example (77) is about ajar, not about co.k 'big', which only specifies the type of jar.
That is, the phrase itself refers to lu.si 'jar', but not to co.k and therefore, lu.si is the
head of the phrase.
Another function of nouns is as predicates and as such, no particular marking or
copulative device is required. Please consider (78).
(78)paya
koya-cay
adobebrick house-DEC
'This is an αί/oèe-house (= a house made from adobe bricks).'
(Vellard 1967:7)The role of a predicate is usually reserved for verbs. When nouns are used as
predicates without particular marking, the distinction between nouns and verbs
becomes blurred316.
Despite this overlap between verbs and nouns, the latter can be set apart by their
ability to function as the subject of a clause (examples 78 and 79).
(79)hep-[p]im-s
kuyla manti-cay311

'The father rules [in] the house.'","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]"

'We go hunting fish in the new balsa raft.' (Vellard 1949:155)The element -kam cannot be explained.
The element -s cannot be explained.
According to the documents, lekku designates a stick used to push the balsa raft. The term kaham
means a particularly large net possibly used as dragnet.
615
According to Vellard, âaka- means 'ready'. However, the translation given in Muysken (2005:49) is 'to
launch' which seems more appropnate in this context
"" ' -na is a loan from Aymara; see also example (19)
613614273CHAPTER 7 - CLAUSESHowever, some topic setting marked adverbs also occur at the beginning of a clause
(cf. 6.1). It remains uncertain whether or to which degree they are dislocated.
A particular use of topic marker -ki is in exhortative clauses, where it is attached
to the verb instead of declarative -cay, which is prohibited (cf. 5.8.1).
( 19)tus[a]-na
s-kepitc-ki
balsa_ raft-LOC CL=3-retum-TOP
'Let us return in the balsa raft! '(Vellard 1949:160)This is rather striking since in most cases, it is the verb that conveys the biggest
chunk of new information. This deviation from the general pattern may be explained
by the possibilty of topic marker -ki to introduce new information in its topic setting
function. This ability may be the conceptual link to its use on verbs in exhortative
clauses.
With respect to topic marked constituents, Givón (1984:256) explains: ""[...], the
subject [...] tends to be part of the old information in clauses, while the rest of the
clause has a higher likelihood of being new information."" Further, a direct
complement is more likely to encode topic information than an indirect complement.
In accordance with this, topic marker -ki appears mainly on subjects and direct
complements when marking old information. When it occurs in its topic setting
function (on a right-dislocated item), it appears mainly on either demonstrative
pronouns or adverbs, i.e. on constituents otherwise unlikely to be marked with -ki.
Similar to declarative -cay, no regular allomorphs of topic marker -ki exist, although
it sometimes looses its final vowel.
7.2.3 Affirmative -pini
Affirmative -pini is a recent loan from Aymara since this marker is testified for
Uchumataqu only in Vellard's (1949-67) and Muysken's (2005) data617. In Aymara,
it is emphatic and best translated as 'truly' (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981:331). However,
in Uchumataqu its meaning depends on the part of speech it is attached to, ranging
from purely affirmative to increasing degree.
With nouns and pronouns, the meaning of affirmative -pini is purely affirmative
and is translated as 'truly, for sure'. It can be regarded as a direct loan from Aymara.

"Acknowledgements
First and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my promoter Pieter
Muysken, without whom this project would have been impossible. I am very grateful
for his never ending support and confidence in this project. He commented on every
section and chapter and his insightful and inspiring suggestions guided me through
the project, which was at times a difficult one. Whenever I approached him with
whatever difficulty I faced, I was given the feeling that nothing but the solution to my
problem mattered and he supported me in every possible way.
I am likewise deeply indebted to Hein van der Voort, with whom I was lucky
enough to share an office for a time. The entire manuscript and particularly the
chapter on phonology profited from his invaluable comments and incredible patience.
I would also like to thank Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke, together with Hein
van der Voort editors of this grammar. Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke
contributed to the manuscript with useful comments and support during the
formatting, which at times was quite challenging.
My thanks also go to Sabine Dedenbach-Salazar Saenz, who was my
copromoter in this project and the one who brought me into contact with UruChipaya. Without her very sharp eye for details, many inconsistencies and
contradictions not only in the manuscript would have gone unnoticed.
I would also like to thank Willem Adelaar for his interest in my research, his
inspiring comments on the manuscript, and his support on many other topics.
Many other people contributed to the study of Uchumataqu, either by
commenting on sections and chapters or by their helpful remarks and suggestions on
presentations: Astrid Alexander-Bakkerus, Susanne Brouwer, Hanke van Buren,
Eithne Carlin, Wolfgang Dietrich, Rafael Fischer, Rik van Gijn, Jesus Mario Giron,
Katharina Haude, Roland Hemmauer, Gertie Hoyman, Peter Masson, Sergio Meira,
Hella Olbertz, Kees Versteegh, and Otto Zwartjes. My research always profited from
their useful comments and critics. Furthermore, I would like to thank Amo Zweden,
who often was my last resort when my Dutch failed me.
I am particularly grateful to my former office mate Swintha Danielsen and to
Sonja Gipper for all the discussions we had, be they on linguistic or non-linguistic
topics. Without their opinion, advice and often enough help, things would have been
much more difficult. I hope this is the only the beginning of further collaboration.
I am also indebted to the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin that gave me
free and uncomplicated access the invaluable manuscripts of Max Uhle and Walter
Lehmann on Uchumataqu (Uru). My thanks go particularly to Gregor Wolff, who
was very co-operative about my archive research. Furthermore, I would like to thank
Colette Grinevald, who allowed me to use her personal notes on her visit to Irohito
and provided me with interesting and useful background information on the language
situation in Bolivia.
In Bolivia, my thanks go to don Lorenzo Inda and his family in Irohito, who
hosted me and answered any of my questions, regardless whether I wished to know
something about their former language or about a trivial matter of everyday life.
Without their friendliness and hospitality, I could not have gained the insight I had inthe present-day situation of the Uru people. I am also grateful to Ciriaco Inda, who
spent his rare time with me pondering on the meaning of words and phrases. Without
Vladimir Salazar I would not have been able to meet the Inda family and I would like
to express my gratitude for his energy and unending support. Whenever I met a
problem, he tried to solve it for me and his profound knowledge of Bolivian society
was an invaluable help, not only to my research but also to my well-being. When it
comes to well-being, I am likewise deeply indebted to Trini Betancourt, who took
care for me in La Paz, treated me like her daughter, and sometimes made the
impossible possible. I also owe many thanks to the native speakers of Chipaya. Their
interest in Uchumataqu and unending patience with my questions enabled me to
comprehend Uchumataqu and its relation to Chipaya better than could have done any
book. Without their help, the film Vellard made about the Uru would be nothing but
beautiful pictures.
This is the place to thank my close friends in Bonn: Christiane, Sabine, Moritz,
Christian, and Alexis. They showed the greatest understanding for me and my
sometimes unusual situation. Without them, the years of thesis writing would have
been less happy.
Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my grandparents for
their ever-lasting care and my mother for wanting me to be happy and for picking up
the receiver every time I called.
Any mistake and error this book may contain is entirely mine.

AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY
Uchumataqu, also known as Uru, was spoken around Lake Titicaca in the
communities of Irohito (northwestern Bolivia), Ch'imu (southeastern Peru), and in
the Bay of Puno (Peru) It is assumed that in pre-colomal times there has been an
Uru-speaking population all along the nvers of the Bolivian Altipiano and at the great
lakes Titicaca, Ροορό and Coipasa Wachtel (1986 283) named this stretch the
""aquatic axis"" Adapting to this environment, the Uru based their economy on
hunting, fishing, and gathering However, it is likely that the Uru already became
dispersed under Inca rule and matters did not improve for the Uru population when
the Spanish arrived In fact, they were forced to leave their traditional communities,
abandon their lifestyle and settle down in Aymara villages By this process, the
community of Irohito became isolated and what could be called one of 'the last
stands' of Uru culture and language Despite less favourable social, economic, and
political circumstances, the small village of Irohito managed to survive and even
maintained its language Uchumataqu Although the Uru, their particular culture and
language had been known since early colonial times, they were not documented
before 1894, when Max Uhle paid a visit to Irohito and for the first time collected
linguistic data Irohito soon became a kind of scientific hot spot (Muysken m s
2007 4) and during the first half of the 20th century, the village was visited by a
number of researchers, who recorded Uchumataqu However, a severe drought at the
beginning of the 1940's brought the end to Irohito, and Uchumataqu became extinct
around 1950 However, Irohito recovered and survived as a settlement Today, there
is a certain pnde of the inhabitants about their distinct culture Although the language
has been extinct for about half a century by now and only the knowledge of some
words and phrases remains, the Uru are aware of their ancient language, which, still,
contnbutes to the Urns' view of themselves as being different from all their
neighbours
This study is based on the efforts and results of the early researchers, who
worked in Irohito and on Uchumataqu between 1894 and 1967 Although a
considerable amount of research had been conducted during this time, only few
studies were actually published and none brought together what had been said on
Uchumataqu Therefore, the aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description
of Uchumataqu, taking into consideration every study, published or unpublished, that
is concerned with linguistic data on Uchumataqu It seeks to give an impression of
this language and its phonological, morphological, and syntactic processes and to
provide linguists from different backgrounds with a reference grammar on this so far
minimally described language Working with (in part) historic material on a language
that is not acquired by anyone any more as native language involves a certain degree
of reconstruction and makes necessary more assumptions and incertainties than
would have been the case with a language that is still spoken However, this study is
not a reconstruction in the sense that it tries to reconstruct a proto-language or the
kind of Uchumataqu that was spoken 500 years ago Rather, its purpose is to describe
the language as it has been recorded during the last 50 years of its existence and is2UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAthus a description of a highly endangered language, which, became extinct two
generations ago. It cannot be denied that material from different researchers with
different backgrounds and recorded at different stages of the language, adds new
problems to the already existing challenge of describing a dying language. Thus, in
some cases our knowledge of certain phenomena remains limited since the data do
not provide solutions and there are no native speakers left to answer questions.
To give a more detailed outline of Uchumataqu, its speakers and the research on
which the present study is based, this chapter will sketch the structure of Uchumataqu
and its differences and similarities with closely related Chipaya, before giving an
overview of the Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara influences on this language. That
will be followed by a description of the history of Irohito, its development during the
20th century, and its position at the beginning of the 21 st century, including a sketch
on the field-work I conducted in Irohito. Before turning to detailed presentation of
the sources considered here, I will comment on the theoretical framework applied for
the current study and the resulting terminology and methodology.
This introductory chapter will be followed by a description of the phonology of
Uchumataqu and its morphophonological processes in chapter 2, which I call
context-sensitive processes. Chapter 3 describes the morphological patterns that can
be observed in Uchumataqu. Then I turn to a description of the nominal system in
chapter 4. Chapter 5 concerns a presentation of the verbal system of Uchumataqu.
The following chapter 6 deals with adverbs, postpositions, and the negation particle
ana. The final chapter of this book provides a description of the clause types and
syntactic operations of Uchumataqu. The appendices contain a comparative
dictionary and transcriptions of Uhle's and Lehmann's manuscripts of Uchumataqu.
1.1 Structural overview of the Uchumataqu language
Together with closely related Chipaya (cf. 1.1.2), Uchumataqu forms the language
family of Uru-Chipaya, which is assumed to be isolated (cf. Torero 2002:466,
Muysken 2001:76). The following summary of the linguistic structure of
Uchumataqu is based on my research and the features addressed here will be further
outlined in chapters 2 to 7.
Uchumataqu phonology differs in some aspects from that of the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Just like these languages Uchumataqu has a rather
elaborate set of plosives. However, these include aspirated, glottalised, and labialised
plosives, and word initial plosive clusters, something that cannot be observed for
Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some affricates and fricatives,
which do not occur in its neighbouring languages, either, such as dental voiceless
affricate /ts/ or postalveolar voiceless fricative [J]1. Another distinctive feature of
Uchumataqu phonology is the 5-vowel system with a long variant of each vowel.
However, increasing influence of Aymara (with a 3-vowel system) caused the
attrition of the 5-vowel system, as can be observed in later studies on Uchumataqu
(e.g. Vellard 1967). The tendency of Uchumataqu to allow consonant clusters is also
reflected in its syllable structure, where a syllable can have the form of CVCC orWhich does not have phonemic status.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"(Vellard 1967:12)7.7.5 Attnbutive predicate clauses
The last predication type to be discussed are attributive predicate clauses, i.e. clauses
that predicate either a quality or a quantity. Morphological features of this type are
predicator -kasi as well as the clausal clitics affirmative -pini and declarative -cay (cf.
7.2.1 and 7.2.3). Both predicator -kasi and affirmative -pini can be followed by
declarative -cay.

'you will lead me'(Vellard 1967:2)The second prefix ke- was completely lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when
Uchumataqu was documented. The form ke- is solely found in combination with the
verb pit- 'to come' (cf. 19). The construction kepit- is translated in the sources as 'to
come back, return' and the form ke- thus expresses the notion of 'back to'. For a
more detailed discussion of the prefix ke-, cf. 5.2.2.1.
(18)kepit-cay

'you return'(Vellard 1951:26)However, apart from these two cases all other verbal elements are suffixes expressing
tense, mood, and aspect. The same is true for nominal, adjectival, and adverbial
morphology, which comprises only suffixes.
Uchumataqu also has clitic elements, which can be split into two groups that are
distinguished by their function282. The first group consists of the markers declarative
-cay, topic marker -ki, and affirmative -pini, which appear in enclitic position (see
examples 17 and 18) and function on the clause level. Declarative -cay and topic
marker -ki are mutually exclusive, but particularly the marker -cay can be preceded
by affirmative -pini. Declarative -cay and topic marker -ki functionally resemble
Aymara -wa and -xa and Quechua -mi and -qa. The second group of clitic elements
bears person reference and consists of-/, referring to first person, -m (second person),
and -s (third person). They appear in pro- or enclitic position, although they
preferably occupy an enclitic position. The personal clitics can follow the first group
of clitic elements, but among themselves are mutually exclusive for the person
reference they express.

The use of object marker -n is somewhat sinking here. It is possible that it reflects the locative object,
in the sense of 'stay in it (= house)'

The morpheme ana negates entire clauses as well as noun, verb, pronominal, and
adjectival phrases, i.e. it can occur with all parts of speech. It has several translations
depending on the context. According to the morphological markers or lexemes ana
can be combined with, four categories can be distinguished. They will be presented
below.
The basic meaning of ana is 'no' or 'not' and in this function, the negation
appears either without any morphological marking at all (example 40) or combines
with clitic elements (41). However, in most cases, ana is not marked at all.

(42)ana-cay tukusakiNEG-DEC yetcold'It is not cold yet.'","[278, 279]"
"(Uhle 1894:58.2)No source other than Uhle mentions the form ana hek. It is possible that this was the
original expression, which became lost due to language attrition and was then
replaced by the periphrastic expression ana ci-culu. This assumption is supported by
the fact that with regard to interrogative pronouns a distinction is made between
human (hek 'who?') and non-human entities (culti 'what?'), which, however, is not
reflected (any more) in the system of indefinite pronouns as represented in sources
after Uhle. Since no further evidence for the use of hek as an indefinite pronoun is
available, 1 will not pursue this topic.
It is in Uhle's and Vellard's data that we find an element -mi attached to the
pronouns hek 'who' (cf. 102, 103) and culu 'what'. Uhle reports four instances, one
of which is uncertain and (104) is the only example found in Vellard.

'In a long time, thunder has not killed any of us [, either].'
The interpretation of -mi is not entirely certain, but I would like to point to CerrónPalomino (2006:177, 178), who interpreted an identical suffix for Chipaya as being
additive. According to the author, additive -mi is attached to indefinite pronouns and
on a clausal level conveys the notion of adding something or someone to (a)
person(s) or object(s) mentioned before. Cerrón-Palomino suggests a translation as
'also; too'. I would like to adopt Cerrón-Palomino's interpretation of -mi as an
additive marker (ADD). However, in Uchumataqu, additive -mi appears to be
restricted to pronouns and does not occur on other parts of speech and I will therefore
not adopt its interpretation as a clausal marker but rather analyse it as a pronominal
marker without sentential scope. Its interpretation and translation is reflected in
(102), (103), and (104) by adding 'either' (due to the use of negation ana) to the
reading provided by the sources. The additive marker -mi is formally identical to the
Quechua declarative marker and it is possible that its use in Uchumataqu and
Chipaya has been inspired by it, particularly with respect to the clausal value ascribed
416Given the original translation by Uhle, an interpretation of-i as subject marker (cf. 5 4 2) is possible
For the additive element -mi, cf. below.

"" I regard nek- to be a mistake since the verb for 'to want' a pek417UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA192to it by Cerrón-Palomino. However, its usage as a marker of addition rather than of
assertion differs notably from Quechua and if the latter indeed had inspired the
Uchumataqu / Chipaya marker, we may assume that this is not a recent development.
Uchumataqu hardly makes any use of additive -mi and, as mentioned above, the are
only four certain instances found.

{'aminpica')(Métraux 1935:109)A further syntactic criterion of Zwicky and Pullum (1983:505f) is that ""[s]yntactic
rules can affect affixed words, but cannot affect clitic groups. [...], no syntactic
operations exist which treat a word combined with one of the clitics [...] as a unit.""
This criterion cannot be applied to the clausal clitics. Affirmative -pini, declarative
-cay, and topic marker -ki have fixed positions following all other nominal or verbal
markers and cannot change positions among each other or with any of their preceding
suffixes. That is, they are bound to an enclitic position. In contrast, the personal
clitics -/, -m, -s have the freedom to occur in a pro- as well as enclitic position (8) and
thus, never form a fixed unit with their host the way an affix does. Furthermore, there
are examples that suggest that -/, -m, -s are able to split up compounds (9).

"(Vellard 1949:155)As mentioned above, temporal adverbs can take nominal morphemes (except yasi) as
well as clausal clitics, such as topic marker -ki, declarative -cay, affirmative -pini, or
clitic elements. However, in most cases, they are not inflected at all.

('aujourd'hui même'1) (lmaintenant,)(Métraux 1935:91,100)These are the only instances where the form (-)paca occurs with temporal adverbs
which provides a small basis for any conclusive statements. However, it seems that
with the expression tonx paca 'even today' a sense of urgency or intensification is
included. Cerrón-Palomino (2006:179, translation mine) observes an identical suffix
for Chipaya which the author labels ""puntualizador"" and describes as follows: ""[...]
the morpheme -paca imprints a sense of urgency or irreplacable pressure on the
situation or event expressed by the phrase to which it is added.""574 I would like to
adopt this definition of-paca and will call the morpheme intensifier (INT). However,
the severly limited database on the form -paca prevents further statements on other
functions or kinds of usage as well as on the type of suffix -paca presents, i.e.
whether it is a nominal, adjectival, or clausal marker. However, it may be well related
to either the Aymara or Quechua word paca which in both languages means 'time'
(DeLucca 1983:328, Lira 1944:720)575.",[270]
"(Muysken 2005:26)As indicated in the glosses, (-)paca has been analysed here as meaning 'place' (Lira
1944:720), i.e. as a noun. Thus, it is probably a loan from Quechua since in Aymara,
paca is restricted to a temporal meaning (DeLucca 1983:328). According to the
translation, it may be possible to analyse the element siq- as being an alternative form
ofasqi 'faraway'.
Together with temporal adverbs, spatial adverbs form a nominally encoded
subclass of adverbs and are conceptually close, as can be seen from forms used both
in a temporal and locational / directional sense.
6.1.3 Adverbs of manner
In most languages, manner adverbs form the largest group of adverbs. However, for
Uchumataqu only a comparatively small number of manner adverbs can be
established which may be due to the documentary situation. Among these adverbs are
asta and loaloa both meaning 'quickly', untu 'hard, strong', and ina 'in vain'. In
contrast to the adverbial subclasses discussed above, manner adverbs are combined
with adjectival morphology, i.e. predicator -kasi (13) and they take clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay or affirmative -pini (14).

(Vellard 1967:11)For yes / no questions that neither display a marked word order nor carry the marker xwi, we may assume that context contributes to their interpretation as interrogative.
7.7 Predicate clauses
The following description of predicate clauses is based on Payne (1997:1 Uff). On
the basis of word order and morphological marking five different types of predicate
clauses can be distinguished.
7.7./ Equative predicate clauses
The first type is what Payne (1997:114) calls equative predicate clauses: ""Equative
clauses are those which assert that a particular entity (the subject of the clause) is
identical to the entity specified in the predicate nominal, [...]."" (marking by the
author). Payne further distinguishes proper inclusion640 from equative predicate
clauses, but in Uchumataqu equative predicate clauses and proper inclusion are
expressed the same way, a common feature as Payne (ibid.) points out.
In most equative predicate clauses, the predicate occurs without an overtly
expressed subject and is marked by declarative -cay (1). This makes them the
morphologically least marked predicate clauses.

"Both Uhle (1894:58.2) and Métraux (1935:105) mention another indefinite pronoun
which is haqeltaqe or hakilta, respectively. It is translated as 'somebody, -one'413.
In attributive position indefinite pronouns precede the head noun or subject they
modify (cf. 96). If the indefinite pronoun is used independently, i.e. without a
referent, it occurs in different positions in a clause. Since indefinite pronouns can
fulfil the function of a noun phrase they very often appear as the head of a phrase. As
such they are mostly placed at the beginning of the phrase they govern (100;
underlined -cay marks the end of a phrase). This phenomenon has also been observed
for Quechua (Cusihuamân 1976:112). However, if the indefinite pronoun does not
function as the head of a phrase, its position is not predictable but ruled by
considerations of topic and discourse.

Indefinite pronouns hardly ever take morphological markers. If there is
morphological marking we find comitative -stani attached to ci (30) as well as clausal
clitics such as declarative -cay or affirmative -pini. The form culu regularly takes
personal clitics (97, 101). Topic marker -ki appears on all indefinite pronouns.

other documents on Uchumataqu. Furthermore, at least the element haqe seems to be a loan from Aymara,
meaning 'man, human being' The second clement -lta(q) may be related to Aymara take 'totality'

collected in 1942 and 1944, except for the data provided by Luis Inta, which
probably come from 1952 (Vellard 1967:34, 36, 37). However, as a footnote (Vellard
1967:36) states the prayers ""Confesión"" and ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" were
recorded nearly ten years after Vellard's first field-work campaign, which, if this
were true, would have been in 1948. This does not correspond to the dates proposed
in table 1.4, for which I am unable to provide an explanation. As usually, no
information on the duration of Vellard's field-work is given.
The data consist mainly of single clauses and only in some cases do more
comprehensive sequences occur, such as question and response. The clauses are of
varying length and complexity and include imperative and interrogative clauses as
well (Vellard 1967:1-24). They are all provided with a word-by-word as well as free
translation. This section is followed by a sample of adverbs and conjunctions
(Vellard 1967:24-26) and interrogative pronouns (Vellard 1967:26). These
grammatical observations are continued by a brief overview of some suffixes, which
are called ""particles with prepositional force""122 (Vellard 1967:27, translation mine),
whose use is further exemplified by clauses (Vellard 1967:28-32). This part is
followed by some basic grammatical observations, which deal with e.g. reduplication
as a means of reinforcement or the meaning of cuki 'let us' in imperative clauses
(Vellard 1967:33). The subsequent data were provided by Luis Inta and consist of a
question and the response to it as well as of the prayers mentioned above. A footnote
to ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" states that this prayer is a somewhat corrupted
Aymara version (Vellard 1967:35, footnote 2)' 23 . The article concludes with a
comparison of numerals (Vellard 1967:36, 37). The first comparison comprises
numerals 1 to 10 supplied by Manuel Inta124 compared to numerals as provided by
Posnansky and numerals 1 to 5 from Tiwanaku. The entire comparison is titled
""ancient numeration of the Titicaca region (as remembered by some old people)""125
(Vellard 1967:36, translation mine). A next comparison comprises numerals 1 to 10
from the ""Uru of Irohito""126, Chipaya, and Puquina, following Ore (1607). It is
noteworthy that the numerals given by Manuel Inta and those under the heading of
""Uru of Irohito"" are not identical, although the numerals from Irohito are congruent
with the rest of my data (cf. 4.4). Finally, numerals 1 to 10 from Aymara and
Quechua are compared. Some of the clauses published in 1967 had already appeared
in earlier works of Vellard, mainly that of 1949.
With respect to evaluation we find a situation similar to the one from 1949, i.e.
most of the data can be verified when compared to e.g. Uhle or Métraux. However, as
already indicated for 1949, the amount of Aymara loan words and grammatical
elements is higher than that in other sources and we find a certain degree of
phonological variation. The data provided by Luis Inta are hardly analysable at all.
The grammatical analysis, interpretation, and translation are only in part

analysis and interpretation are best considered separately from each other. The data
themselves are as informative and reliable as those from e.g. Vellard 1949.
Although Vellard mentions only some of his visits (cf. table 1.4), particularly
those during which he had collected linguistic data, it becomes obvious from
footnotes, etc. that he was in Irohito several times. The following table is an attempt

Table 1.4· Overview of Vellard's visits to Irohito1.4.2.6 Final remarks
Although the personal backgrounds of the researchers presented above are highly
divergent and most of them did not have any intensive contact with each other, the52UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAdata collected are consistent to a considerable degree. That is, the grammatical
materials provided by Uhle (1894) and Métraux (1935) are very well comparable and
confirm each other's results, which is also true with respect to the lexical material
collected by Polo (1901) and Lehmann (1929). It is only with Vellard's data that we
find a certain difference with regard to the results of the preceding studies, which can
be ascribed to an increasing influence of Aymara and the de facto extinction of
Uchumataqu. It is one of the tragedies of the language that the first researchers
studied Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already highly
endangered, unfortunately left hardly any information on their language consultants,
etc. Therefore, we know virtually nothing about their field trip experiences. Vellard
was the only researcher who bothered to introduce his language consultants and
provided background information on his field-work. However, Vellard visited Irohito
when the community and its language had as good as vanished. Despite these less
favourable circumstances the data found in the several documents can be regarded as
a reliable and highly informative source on Uchumataqu.
Certain restrictions have to be taken into consideration when dealing with the
sources on Uchumataqu. Although not always mentioned explicitly, we have to
assume that data collection required the use of three languages: Spanish, Aymara,
and Uchumataqu. This gives plenty of room for interference on the language
consultant's as well as on the interpreter's and researcher's parts. Furthermore, none
of the language consultants, interpreters, or researchers was a native speaker of
Spanish127.
It also has to be taken into consideration that only Uhle had professional
linguistic training, while the other researchers were either social anthropologists or
even came from completely unrelated disciplines. For them, the recording of
Uchumataqu was rather a sideline in their career, which they did not further pursue
(except Vellard)128. This leads to the observation that all researchers lived in a time
when the idea of academic research differed considerably from that of present-day
research. Even those researchers who did not have linguistic or anthropological
training considered themselves qualified to collect linguistic data, a consideration
originating in the old idea of the 'all-round scientist'. Furthermore, there were no
standards or a unified methodology for language documentation and description and
thus, every researcher used his own techniques and methodology. Particularly Uhle
was influenced by a Latin-based grammar model, which he tried to apply to
Uchumataqu. Furthermore, most researchers tried and compared Uchumataqu to
Aymara and, to a lesser degree, to Quechua, which does not yield satisfying results,
particularly with respect to the verbal system. This bias towards a standardised
(Andean) grammar model resulted in turning the language consultant's information
into what was thought appropriate by the researcher, as in the case of Uhle.
Other aspects that today would be considered inadequate are the short periods of
time spent in the language community as well as the collaboration with only one or
two persons. The average time spent in Irohito was about one week129, which is

Furthermore, Uhle's manuscript also contains some notes concerning his journey,
and anthropological observations. They are considered for the current work only to a
minor degree.

a word list comparing Uchumataqu and Chipaya (six single pages)
another word list where Uhle compares his data to those collected by Polo67,

an Uru-German vocabulary (9 pages)
a brief word list Spanish-Atacamefio with some notes by Uhle (three pages)

some notes and preliminary grammatical interpretations; possibly in preparation

Some of them were clearly made while collecting the data, whereas others were
probably added afterwards. They enable us to get an insight into the way Uhle
obtained and treated his information, something he himself does not further specify.
Thus, Uhle reports the expression tsi: wa.sa 'once' but remarks: ""The Indian gave me
tsi u.nu, but u.nu is probably Spanish WHO!""68 (Uhle 1894:33, translation mine). That
is, Uhle does not use the expression his language consultant provided but what he

too, even if Uhle does not mark them as 'corrected'. A similar process can be
observed with the use of parenthesis, as e.g. on -kin(a) 'to, towards' (Uhle 1894:11).
Although Uhle does not explain when and why he uses parenthesis, it is likely that
they mark elements that were not realised due to e.g. elision but which Uhle
considers to be necessary.
When it comes to an evaluation of the manuscript, we have to take into
consideration that Uhle spent only a short time in Irohito, worked only with one
language consultant, whose background remains unknown, he probably needed an
interpreter speaking Aymara and Spanish, and possibly changed some of his data to
what he considered appropriate. However, despite these restrictions Uhle's work can
be regarded as one of the most important documents on Uchumataqu. Not only was
he the first researcher ever to collect any linguistic data, but he also documented
Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already endangered. His
description of the nominal and pronominal system is supported by following works
and even modem studies on the closely related Chipaya (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006)
confirm his findings. In conclusion, Uhle's manuscript contains highly valuable
information on Uchumataqu.
1.4.2.2 José T. Polo (1841-1918)
José Toribio Polo was bom in Ica in 1841 and went to Lima to study history at the
Convictorio de San Carlos and the Seminary of Santo Toribio but never completed
his studies there69 (Dager Alva 2000:147, footnote 48). Beside other occupations, he
worked at the Archive del Cabildo eclesiastico, the Tribunal de Cuentas, and the
Biblioteca Nacional, of which he was subdirector (Dager Alva 2000:137, footnote 3).
Polo died in Lima in 1918.
According to Polo's profession the introduction to his work Indios uros del Peru
y Bolivia (1901) contains a detailed compilation of notes on the Uru in historical
sources, including a comparison of the historical representation of Cunza, Puquina,
and Uru (pp. 445-455). Since at that time Uchumataqu was considered to be identical
with or related to the historical Puquina mentioned by Ore (1607), Polo provides a
comparative word lists of Puquina-Uchumataqu-Spanish, which consists of twenty
items and includes the numerals 1-10 (p. 456). This list is followed by a Puquina
version of the Lord's Prayer (p. 456). Polo also adds a brief comparative word list
Atacameno-Uchumataqu of only seven items (p. 457). The following etymological
discussion of the name 'Uro' (p. 457) as well as some anthropological considerations
(pp. 459-463) are also dominated by historical considerations. These aspects make up
more than half of Polo's work on the Uru.
The Uchumataqu-Spanish word list (pp. 464-479) itself consists of about 300
words, which are ordered according to the Spanish alphabet. It comprises nouns of
As Dager Alva (2000.147) points out, at this time historiography was not a subject with an academic
tradition and it still lacked a unified methodology. Correspondingly, Dager Alva (2000:135) describes Polo
as belonging to a ""generation of historians in transition between an amateur-like history and a more
professional one""69. Regardless of these restrictions, Polo can be characterised as a historiographer and his
first and foremost field of activity was history34UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAseveral semantic fields, e.g. kinship terms, body parts, clothing, domesticated and
non-domesticated animals as well as natural and religious phenomena, personal
pronouns, and numerals. The list further contains directions, adjectives, colour terms,
and verbs of every class. Polo adds footnotes that either explain in greater detail a
particular word or point to the Aymara or Quechua origin of the item. The author also
provides a list of fourteen Spanish loan words (p. 478) and about 30 phrases (p. 478479), which he considered to be of frequent use. They include the questions for food,
one's name, and one's well-being. Polo concludes his article with some brief remarks
on his spelling of Uchumataqu lexemes and some basic grammatical observations on
compounding, personal pronouns, numerals, adjectives, the negation ana, and kinship
terms. He also provides basic notes about the verbal tense system, adverbs, and the
agglutinative character of Uchumataqu (pp. 479-482).
It is noteworthy that Polo does not use a particular phonological transcription
system but represents the Uchumataqu items by using the Spanish alphabet. The only
adaptation is that [kk], [pp], and [tt] are employed to ""reinforce the sound and also
distinguish certain words""70 (Polo 1901:480, translation mine).
Polo remains vague about the circumstances under which he collected his data.
He mentions a small vocabulary by Augusto Benavides (Polo 1901:464), which he
used to compare it to his own data. Polo ascribes differences to either dialectal
variation or to a certain ""confusion on the Urus' part for being questioned in
Aymara""71 (Polo 1901:464, translation mine). It remains uncertain whether Polo
refers to Benavides' language consultants, who were confused for being questioned
in Aymara, or his own. In case he refers to his language consultants, it is still
unknown whether Polo spoke Aymara sufficiently to communicate directly with the
Uchumataqu speakers or whether he relied on an interpreter. Further, Polo does not
specify who his language consultants were, but since he uses a plural form when
refering to them he must have worked with at least two speakers. Polo was
accompanied by Javier Gonzalez del Valle, a professor at the Colegio National in
Puno, and Enrique Gamero, likewise a resident of Puno. The latter contributed to
Polo's article by collecting data in the villages of Ancoaqui and Ahuallamaya (Polo
1901:463). Polo (ibid.) also expresses his thanks to Victor R. Cavinos, who left him
some words and phrases of Uchumataqu. Since both Gamero as well as Cavinos are
Spanish surnames, it is unlikely that they were native speakers of Uchumataqu and
therefore Polo's article does not only comprise his own data but also those of other
researchers, which, however, is not indicated in the word list itself. Thus, it remains
entirely unknown whom Polo worked with, whether he had an interpreter, and which
of the data result from his own field-work and which do not.
However, Polo (1901:463) mentions that he visited the Lake Titicaca region in
February 1897 to collect his data, which then were published four years later. He
does not further specify the duration of this trip but since Polo (1901:463) refers to it
as ""una ràpida excursion"", it must have been a rather short time. For all we know this
was Polo's only visit to the Uru, at least for linguistic purposes. We do not know of""Las letras kk, pp, /ƒ, son para reforzar el somdo, y distinguir asi algunas palabras "" (italics by author)
""[...] pueden provenir de equivocación de los indios al ser preguntados en aimarâ ""CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION35which kind Polo's relationship to his language consultants was, but it is remarkable
that he characterises the Uru as remaining in their ""primitive state"" and points out
that the Spanish conquerers could oppress them only by work and taxes (Polo
1901:459, 460). This description shows that Polo was not only influenced by the
picture of the Uru as presented in historical sources but also by the general idea of his
time that there is a constant progression from primitive to less primitive to civilised
human communities72 (cf. Dager Alva 2000:138).
For an evaluation of Polo's data, we have to take into consideration that Polo's
language consultants and their personal backgrounds remain unknown as does the
exact duration of Polo's apparently brief stay with the Uchumataqu speakers.
Furthermore, we do not know whether Polo needed an interpreter. Finally, his article
contains data other than his own, but it is not indicated which these are. However, the
lexical material presented by Polo is mainly congruent with that of other researchers,
although similarities are sometimes difficult to establish due to Polo's uncommon
spelling. The phrases, clauses, and verbal paradigms hardly ever agree with those of
other sources. It happens frequently that Polo reports a feature which other sources
do not mention or else a particular feature is similar in all sources except for Polo.
That is, Polo's phrases, clauses, and paradigms can be hardly verified and thus, his
grammatical material is only in part reliable.
1.4.2.3 Walter Lehmann (1878-1939)
Walter Lehmann was bom on September 18lh 1878 in Berlin and began to study
medicine at the University of Greifswald in 1898 (Riese 1983:311), but pursued his
career as an anthropologist rather than a doctor73. Between 1907 and 1909 Lehmann
paid a first visit to Mesoamerica and received a doctoral degree in Americanist
studies in 191374 and the qualification for lecturing at the university in 1914 (Riese
1983:313). After further research in Mexico and Guatemala (1925/26), Lehmann
visited South America in 1929 and 193075. One result of this field trip are the
manuscripts on Uchumataqu described below. Walter Lehmann died in Berlin 1939.
Lehmann left four manuscripts on Uchumataqu, which are:
-a fair copy of the manuscript from Ancoaqui (Lehmann 1929b)76
the original manuscript from Ch'imu (Lehmann 1929c)
a fair copy of the manuscript from Ch'imu (1929d)
a comparative word list Ch'imu-Ancoaqui ( 1929e)It is to say that similar statements are found in most works of that time, including e g Uhle's
manuscript presented above.
73
Although in 1901 he started attending classes on Amencan cultures taught by Eduard Seier, Lehmann
qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1903 However, in the same year he began to work as a trainee at the
Volkerkunde Museum in Berlin (Riese 1983 312) and in 1910 he became a curator at the Königliches
Volkerkunde Museum in Munich.
74
The work he wrote for this purpose is titled Amerikanische Sprach-Volks- und Altertumskunde and was
published in Munich in 1920. One year later, these efforts made him director of the Ethnologisches
Forschungs- und Lehrinstitut hei den Staatlichen Museen in Berlin.

5630UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAUhle stayed in Irohito between 23rd August and lsl September 1894 (Uhle 1894 m.s.
Chronologie meiner Erfahrungen57:!) and for all we know, this was his only visit to
the community. He does not provide the name of his language consultant but only
refers to him as ""at least one who taught me his language, in spite of his fellows""58
(Uhle 1896:19, translation mine). That is, the Uchumataqu data collected by Uhle
stem from one single speaker and except for the fact that he was male nothing further
is said about him. Neither does Uhle specify the personal relationship to his language
consultant, although he twice mentions him as his ""teacher"" (Uhle 1894:3, 89.1).
However, we do not know whether he refers to his visit to Irohito or Huachacalla.
With respect to his language skills, Max Uhle spoke Spanish but probably
hardly any Aymara59 at the time he visited Irohito and it was only after his trip to
Irohito that Uhle became more acquainted with Aymara (cf. Rowe 1954:106).
Although he mentions an interpreter for his studies on Chipaya (Uhle 1896:331)60,
we find no unequivocal hint to an interpreter for his trip to Irohito. Only once does
Uhle (1894:82, translation mine) remark upon ""an interpreter speaking a second
Indian language""61 but it remains uncertain whether he refers to his study on Chipaya
or Uchumataqu. However, it seems justified to assume that Uhle was dependent upon
an interpreter in Irohito as well. Thus, the languages used in the process of data
collection must have been Uchumataqu, Aymara, and Spanish.
The Uchumataqu data have never been published and are thus available only as
a manuscript, which, as part of Uhle's academic legacy, is in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. The manuscript is handwritten in what is
today an old-fashioned script called Siitterlin and with a few exceptions Uhle uses
German throughout his notes.
The part of the manuscript that is of importance here is the grammar of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya called ""Basic outline of an Uro grammar"" (Grundzüge
einer Uro-Grammatik). It consists of 117 single and double pages, some of which are
not numbered, in which case I cite them as e.g. 64.1. Here, 64 refers to the last page
number Uhle used, while . 1 indicates that it is the first unnumbered page after this;
correspondingly, 64.2 would refer to the second unnumbered page following p. 64.
Although the first section in Uhle's manuscript is about the language of Irohito,
the manuscript itself is concerned with both varieties, i.e. Uhle treats Uchumataqu
and Chipaya and melts them into one grammatical description. He often indicates
where he obtained a particular piece of information from or which variety a statement
refers to, but does not consistently do so. In some cases, he points to differences
between the two varieties. However, Uhle deals with every aspect of the language
and his manuscript is thus an entire grammar of Uru-Chipaya. Although Uhle
collected a considerable number of sentences and more than 600 words in Irohito
(Uhle 1896:19), his grammar does not contain texts but single sentences. These are
transcribed according to the phonological transcription conventions of Uhle's time'Chronology of my expenences' (translation mine)
""[ .] wenigstens einen, der mich, den eigenen Angehöngen zum Trutze, seine Sprache lehrte.""

58CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION31(cf. chapter 2) and therefore the data convey not only grammatical but also
phonological information. As it was common in the late 19th century, Uhle used a
Latin-based model for his grammar, which particularly with respect to the verbal
system led to a certain frustration on the researcher's part:
While recording the language I tried several times to conjugate a short verbal
phrase through the different tenses but all I got was that with every person I
received an entirely new tense changing the entire meaning of the sentence,
[...]. Particularly the answers on tense were always the most unsatisfactory.
Some of these answers I had to correct by cross-checking two, three times but
did not always succeed. (Uhle 1894:84, translation mine)62
Uhle also compares his results to Aymara referring to the grammar of Middendorf
(1891), observing similarities and differences and repeatedly pointing to the
increasing Aymara influence on Uchumataqu.
From Uhle's difficulties to describe the verbal system a certain bias results
towards the nominal and pronominal system of the language: it is by far the most
elaborate section and an almost complete description of the nominal and pronominal
aspects of Uru-Chipaya. In comparison, the verbal system is less detailed and as
indicated in the quotation above, Uhle is concerned mainly with the tense system,
while he is less interested in e.g. aspectual features. Furthermore, most of the data
exemplifying the verbal system seem to come from Chipaya. Other parts of the
language are treated equally briefly, e.g. postpositions, clausal markers, and adverbs.
Each of these topics receives only a few pages' treatment. In the following I give a
rough sketch of the contents of the grammar. The numbering is mine.

"9With one exception found in Métraux (1935 108)CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION9The form -paca occurs in two different functions in Uchumataqu. In its first function
it is attached to adverbs of time in order to act as intensifier (cf. 6.1.1). Both Aymara
and Quechua have a noun paca meaning 'time' and it is likely that Uchumataqu paca in its intensifying function on temporal adverbs has been inspired by it. There is
another form -paca on Uchumataqu wakpaca 'all, everything', which consists of
Aymara waki 'part, portion' (also 'price') (DeLucca 1983:444) and the totality
marking suffix -pacha (DeLucca 1983:328). The expression wakpaca itself is not
used in Aymara and waki occurs only in the last stage of Uchumataqu, as
documented by Vellard.
The plural marker -naka occurs in both Aymara and Uchumataqu and it is
impossible to say whether its use on nouns is recent or not, whereas its use on the
personal pronoun ninaka 'they' is possibly a more recent development (cf. 4.1.4).
Terminative marker -kama occurs in Aymara, Quechua, and Uchumataqu. In
Aymara and Quechua it has a distributive and terminative meaning. In Quechua,
terminative -kama also outlines the direction of a course or trajectory. This meaning
is not found in Aymara but a meaning of terminative -kama limited to Aymara is that
of'only', i.e. exclusiveness. In Uchumataqu, these different meanings of terminative
-kama have been reduced to temporal 'until'. It is this restricted use that gives rise to
the assumption that -kama spread from Aymara or Quechua into Uchumataqu and not
vice versa, although it is not impossible, either, that Aymara or Quechua adopted this
suffix from Uchumataqu and extended its meaning (cf. 4.1.1.6).
A similar observation can be made for benefactive -taki, which has been
borrowed from Aymara. Uchumataqu adopted only the benefactive function, in
which benefactive -taki is translated as 'for'. In Uchumataqu, possessive predicate
clauses are created with the benefactive marker -taki and the copulative verb sel- 'to
be, exist'. These constructions are translated as 'for X exists', as in wir-takfij sel-cay
koya 'I have a house.' (lit.: 'For me a house exists.' Vellard 1951:33). This function
of benefactive -taki is not found in Aymara (cf. 4.1.2.2).
The Uchumataqu resultative marker -t resembles the Aymara resultative marker
-ta with respect to form and function to some degree. It is possible that both suffixes
influenced each other or one inspired the use of the other, but Uchumataqu resultative
-/ is not a direct loan from Aymara -ta (cf. 5.2.1).
The lexicon is by far that part of Uchumataqu that shows the largest degree of
borrowing. However, not every word shared with Aymara or Quechua is necessarily
a loan. We may assume that the name of fish, water birds, types of totora reed and
other water plants as well as denominations for balsa rafts, their parts, and tools for
hunting and fishing were adopted by Aymara and Quechua from Uchumataqu rather
than vice versa. However, when it comes to agricultural terms and words denoting
non-aquatic plants and species, expressions found in both Aymara and Uchumataqu
are probably loans in the latter. Spanish had some influence on Uchumataqu with
respect to kinship terms and, of course, modem technical devices. Note that one of
the last semantic fields not influenced are Uchumataqu numbers10, although VellardIn contrast to Chipaya, where numerals above 4 have long been replaced by the Aymara terms10UCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA(1951 18) reports pataka '100' instead of kalo-kalo, which would have been the
Uchumataqu word The word pataka is Aymara but also close to Quechua pachak
Finally, I should mention some features that can be described as areal
phenomena rather than loans Among these areal features are the agglutinative nature
of Uchumataqu, its predominately SOV structure, stress on the penultimate syllable,
and the structure of the Uchumataqu nominal and verbal system, which resemble that
of Aymara and Quechua Thus, although Uchumataqu is genetically unrelated to
Aymara and Quechua, centuries-long contact produced a certain degree of adaptation
and similarity
In the present study, I compare Uchumataqu to the northern Aymara variety
spoken around Lake Titicaca, which has been described by Porterie-Gutiérrez (1981)
and Huayhua Pari (2001), who carried out a study on the Peruvian variety of Aymara
Since Lake Titicaca stretches across the border of Peru and Bolivia, it is justified to
take also into consideration the Peruvian Aymara variety, which may as well have
exerted some influence on Uchumataqu Only if there is an Aymara element present
in my data but undescnbed by Porterie-Gutiérrez and Huayhua Pan do I refer to
works dealing with other Aymara varieties
1 2 The present study
In the following I will briefly describe the theoretical framework applied for the
current study, the terminology resulting from the theoretical framework, and the
methodology used m working with the Uchumataqu data
7 2 7 Theoretical framework and terminology
Given that the material on Uchumataqu is heterogenous and that the grammatical
description is meant for linguists from different backgrounds, no specific linguistic
theoretical framework is employed Instead, it is first and foremost a descriptive
work, whose theoretical framework can be best described by what Dixon (1997 128)
calls ""Basic Linguistic Theory"" Dryer (in prep 3) supplies the following explanation
of what can be understood by this ""It can thus be roughly described as traditional
grammar, minus its bad features (such as a tendency to describe all languages in
terms of concepts motivated for European languages), plus necessary concepts absent
from traditional grammar [ ] Basic linguistic theory differs from traditional
grammar most strikingly in its attempt to describe each language in its own terms,
rather than trying to force the language into a model based on European languages ""
That is, basic linguistic theory is primarily descriptive, adopting ideas, techniques,
etc from other theories, if they refer to or describe a phenomenon appropriately
Works that contributed to a considerable degree to the framework of the current
description of Uchumataqu are among others Shopen (1985) and Payne (1997)
Correspondingly, specific terminology has been avoided whenever possible
However, if a particular theoretical concept or term has been borrowed, its usage in
the current grammatical description is explainedCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION111.2.2 Notes on methodology and presentation of the data
First, it is necessary to provide a definition of what is considered as primary and
secondary data in the current study. By primary data, I understand data that have
been collected during field-work and thus represent first-hand experience of
Uchumataqu and its speakers. Since the current work is primarily a linguistic
description, purely ethnographic data are considered mainly for background
information on the Uru culture and history (cf. Posnansky 1934, LaBarre 1941,
Palavecino 1949). I consider the following sources as primary data: Uhle (1894),
Polo (1901), Bacarreza (1910), Lehmann (1929), Métraux (1935), LaBarre (1941),
Palavecino (1949), Vellard (1949, 1950, 1951, 1967), Grinevald (1995), and
Muysken (2001, 2005). Secondary data are those that provide an analysis and
interpretation on the basis of primary data and therefore studies as e.g. Torero (2002)
are regarded as secondary data and add to the description only to a minor degree. The
grammatical description attempted is first and foremost concerned with primary
linguistic data on Uchumataqu.
The spelling of the data quoted here is based on what has been established as the
phonemic system of Uchumataqu (cf. 2.1-2.10). However, it is not a phonemic
spelling in a strict sense, since at the present state of research I am unable to state
what the phonemes of e.g. the word 'to go' are. I will thus present different possible
spellings. This leads, of course, to a certain amount of variation. For example, the
verb for 'to go' is represented as either oq-, ok-, or ok""a (another example can be
found in table 2.1). For further discussion of orthographical practices and
representation, cf. 2.14.
In most cases I adopt the translations provided by the researchers, who have
been with the Uchumataqu speakers and probably had the best opportunities to crosscheck their material. However, in case I propose an analysis, interpretation, and / or
translation different from that of the researcher, the original analysis, interpretation
and / or translation is provided in brackets. This also applies to Uchumataqu forms,
phrases, or clauses for which I propose a different transcription, as is the case with
e.g. -srap'pa (Vellard 1949-67). I propose to transcribe the form as -s-xapa but add
Vellard's original transcription in brackets. Elements I reconstruct, such as e.g. topic
marker -k[i], are marked by brackets, while parenthesis mark additions, restrictions,
etc. made by the researchers themselves. However, in any case, glosses are mine.
The primary data are always quoted with the year of publication, i.e. although
Vellard might have collected certain data in 1938, he published them in 1949 and
accordingly, I quote material from this work as Vellard (1949). Only in the case of
the unpublished material of Uhle and Lehmann do I refer to the year the material has
been collected. In Uhle's case, this would be 1894, while Lehmann is quoted as
1929b and 1929d. Since no other researcher (with the exception of Uhle, see below)
provides data from outside Irohito, this is necessary only with Lehmann.
As will be further outlined below, Uhle (1894) aims to merge data from
Uchumataqu and Chipaya in his manuscript and in some cases does not indicate
whether a certain example comes from Uchumataqu or Chipaya. Therefore, I decided
to use only those clauses, phrases, etc. that are clearly marked as from Uchumataqu.
However, in some cases I also quote unmarked material, i.e. material the origin of12UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAwhich is uncertain but I only do so when that material can be confirmed by other
sources on Uchumataqu (e.g. Vellard 1949-67). An example is the phrase am qoya
'your house' (Uhle 1894:46), which is not marked for origin. Since identical phrases
are found in other sources that exclusively contain data from Uchumataqu, such as
amp kui[a]u 'your house' (Vellard 1967:29), Uhle's unmarked example clause can
be included in the grammatical description. However, such cases are exceptional and
if an unmarked example from Uhle's manuscript is given, it is indicated in a footnote.
1.3 Historical overview: from colonial times until today
In the following, I will give a brief description of notes and reports on the Uru from
early colonial times to the most recent studies.
1.3.1 The names Uru and Uchumataqu
Several names have been applied to the Uru and their language during the last 500
years. In what follows, I will give a brief overview of the names applied and will
discuss the denomination chosen for the current work. The list of sources quoted in
the following is by no means exhaustive but represents only a part.
In colonial sources we find the name Uro to be the most common one when
referring to the people12. Both Alonso Ramos Gavilân (Historia del santuario de
Nuestra Senora de Copacabana, [1621] 1988:82) and Antonio de Castro y del
Castillo (Juicio de Limites entre el Peru y Bolivia, [1651] 1906:201) also give the
name Ochosuma, and Gavilân specifies that this was the common appellation of the
ethnic group. The origin and meaning of this name is entirely uncertain and we do
not even know whether it was a self-denomination of the Uru people or a name given
to them by their neighbours. With respect to the language, most chroniclers do not
provide a name but only say that the Uru had their own language, which was
different from all others. However, Mercado de Penalosa ([1586] 1965:336) and
Balthasar Ramirez ([1597] 1936:48) state that the Uru language was called Pukina.
According to Espinoza Soriano ([1575-77] 1981:195, translation mine), Uru and
Uruquilla were denominations of two different ethnic groups: ""The Uros in this
empire are less numerous than the Aymaras, Uruquillas and Sevaroyos.""13. This
opinion is not shared by Weston LaBarre (1941:500), who states: ""The Uroquillas of
the early chroniclers appears to have meant the Uru; [...]•""· Espinoza Soriano's
observation is likewise rejected by Torero. Following Torero (2002:468), Uruquilla
refered to the language family Uru-Chipaya, while the name Uro (or Ochosuma)
meant only the people with a water-based economy. In the process of aymaricisation,
the term Uruquilla was lost and the appellation Uru, formerly restricted to the people,
became generalised to refer to the speakers and their language. In the light of what
has been said by Espinoza Soriano, LaBarre's and Torero's statements may be
questioned, although the discussion about Uru and Uruquilla continues.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"162UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAcannot be analysed and most may be regarded as lexicalised. Furthermore, we lack a
context to these phrases and therefore, it remains largely unclear how they were used.
Taking this into consideration the following will be restricted to a mere presentation
of phrases and discussion will concern only some general features and observations.

cunukasiì4ì 'alright' (Vellard 1951:20). Others can be understood only in part. This is
the case with e.g. cuni luxkucay wat cay 'thank you (for the meal)' (Vellard 1951:20)
where cuni luxkucay means 'I ate well' but the expression wat'cay remains elusive
(cf. Muysken 2005). The same is true for 'good evening' which is expressed as
sequese sincilita (Polo 1901:479). The first element sequese is reminiscent of the
word for 'evening' sericai or seheri (Polo 1901:476) but the form sincilita remains
uncertain342. Other forms that cannot be explained are kuntinsw, kal tinskucay, kamtun, and wa.ntuncay. It is possible that tun- of kam-tun and wa.ntuncay is related to
the verb stem tuna- or tona- meaning 'to come'. Provided these expressions are
indeed part of the Uchumataqu register of phrases, well-wishes, and greetings, it is
likely that they are lexicalised.
The element -ay or -lay344 occurs on the respectful address for a superior person
appay or apây 'father', on epalai145 'good day', on cicalay used to greet a brother or
a person of equal rank. It may have inspired the interjection hay 'oh', as in hay
happay 'oh, father' (Vellard 1951:19) in response to happay. If the element -ay or
-lay has ever been a suffix of Uchumataqu it was not productive any more at the time
of documentation and it does not occur elsewhere. Although its exact meaning
therefore has to remain uncertain it seems justified to propose that it conveys the idea
of a respectful and polite address when attached to kinship terms. These terms, then,
may be considered to be an appropriate way of expressing politeness and respect
when dealing with a person one is not related to.
Finally, the greeting exchanged between husband and wife should be mentioned.
The husband greets his wife with tun'una atto (Vellard 1951:20) which itself is not
translated by Vellard. The first element tun 'una shows considerable similarity with
the verb ton- 'to come' (Métraux 1935:109)346 while the second element atto is a
kinship term meaning 'mother'. In response the wife replies with wa.ntuncay apay341The change of/i/ to /u/ on curnt- cannot be explained
Métraux points to the similarity between the expression for 'good evening' and the word for 'evening'
sese.
343
The element kun could be a form of second person singular. For further dicussion, cf. 4 2.5 1.1
344
See also Polo (1901 481) who points out that male kinship terms end in -at
345
Although Métraux translated this expression as 'good day' it is likely that it means the same as happay,
i e. 'father' in respectfully addressing a person of higher rank, epalai shows considerable similarity to the
kinship term ep '(biological) father'.
346
Vellard does not mention the use of the verb ton- 'to come'
342164UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAwhere wa.ntun- remains largely inexplicable except for the element -tun- which again
is reminiscent of'to come'. The term apay means 'father' as outlined above. That is,
the kinship terms of 'father' and 'mother' are used between husband and wife in
order to express politeness and respect347. This consideration gives further support to
the assumption that with respect to pragmatics kinship terms function as a polite
means to address people of equal or higher social rank. Thus, they have a scope
beyond the simple denotation of relationship.","[178, 179, 180, 181]"

"239CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM5.7.3 Chain verb constructions
What may be understood as a kind of subcategory to subordination are the so-called
chain verb constructions (cf. Muysken 2001:108). The matrix verb is often the
volition verb pek- 'to want' and the complement verb is zero marked, i.e. it consists
of the verb stem alone. Although two different actions (e.g. 'want' and 'eat') are
expressed, these are closely related, as can also be seen by word order, where the
complement verb immediately precedes the matrix verb (cf. chapter 7.8.2).

(Métraux 1935:90)If at all, chain verb constructions come closest to what could be described as

('/'/ ne peut se lever')(Métraux 1935:99)With respect to verb class, we find chain verb constructions involving action,
cognition, utterance, and motion verbs537. Although the database is limited, we may
assume that there is no restriction with regard to verb class. As in simple declarative
clauses, person reference is expressed mainly by the use of a subject or subject
pronoun, the latter one is frequently inflected with a subject clitic (cf. 99 and 100).
5.8 Mood and modality
The terms mood and modality have been extensively discussed in the literature and
the resulting definitions reflect the various approaches to this topic. A detailed
discussion of the terms is beyond the scope of this section and in what follows, I rely
on Foley and Van Valin (1984) as cited in Bybee (1985).
Mood is understood by Bybee as 'a marker on the verb that signals how the
speaker chooses to put the proposition into the discourse context.' (1985:165), i.e. the
speaker makes a statement on his / her view of the predication. According to this
definition, mood is subdivided by Bybee into ""illocutionary force"" and ""commitment
to the truth of the assertion"" (1985:170), the first subgroup consisting of imperative,
Optative, Admonitive, Prohibitive, and Interrogative, the latter of Subjunctive,
Dubitative, Probable, Potential, and Conditional. If this definition is applied to53maska 'pot' is a loan from Quechua
putti- is a loan from Spanish puedo 'I can'. The ending -u is interpreted as Uchumataqu first person
singular.
537
In one example the adjective kewa 'fat' is used as a verb, in the sense of 'to get fat'
536UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA240Uchumataqu and the inflection with declarative marker -cay is chosen as a criterion
(cf. Bybee 1985:170), the following scheme evolves:
Speech act type 538
Interrogative, imperative, optative =
Illocutionary force
Potential, conditional, future irrealis539 =
Speaker's commitmentInflection with declarative -cay
—
+Table 5.4: Mood, speech act type, and inflection with declarative -cayWe find that those speech act types labelled by Bybee as ""illocutionary force"" (ibid.)
cannot take declarative -cay, whereas those which express the speaker's commitment
can take the marker as can any basic declarative clause. Thus, the proposition made
by Bybee (on the basis of Foley and Van Valin 1984) is valid for Uchumataqu, too,
and accordingly, the speech act types treated in the following sections (imperative,
Optative, Potential, Conditional, and the so-called future irrealis) are viewed as mood
categories.
A term not yet mentioned is deontic and Foley and Van Valin (1984:214) and
Bybee (1985:166) agree on that it belongs to the category of modality but not to
mood since deontic modalities always refer to the agent of the predication and not to
the speaker. Thus, the categories of mood and modality in Uchumataqu can be
sketched as follows:/\Mood (speaker related)illocutionary force
-cay not permittedιModality (agent related)speaker's commitment
conditions on the agent
-cay permitted
-cay permittedFigure 5.1: Mood and modality; inflection with DEC -cay

"(Uhle 1894:68.2)However, declarative -cay is also used in clauses containg a full verbal predicate
although in such cases, the tendency is to occur without it.
(52)ana tulun kun-tani okwfaj-aki-cay
NEG griefyou-COM gO-FU-DEC'Won't you (sg) go with grief?' (lit.: 'Won't the grief go with you?')
(Vellard 1949:169)637
It is possible that the application of declarative -cay marks an increased certainty on
the speaker's side with respect to the answer. Thus, when the speaker believes to
know the answer, (s)he uses declarative -cay, whereas in a case when the answer
cannot be anticipated by the speaker declarative -cay is missing. If this proposition is
true, then example (50) would display a lack of certainty, i.e. it is unknown to the
speaker what his / her interlocutor may want. In example (52), however, a particular
answer may even be expected (namely, that Vellard would not leave easily) and thus,
the speaker feels able to use declarative -cay in his question.
In some cases, declarative -cay and question bound topic marker -ki are
combined, which I regard as errors since these markers are generally mutually
exclusive (cf. 7.2). The answer to a yes / no question is the repetition of the verb, as
demonstrated in example (53a) and (b).
The use of certainty -kala is somewhat sinking here It may be interpreted as 'Wouldn't you like a rest?
Do you really want to go on?' but this has to remain a speculation.

"6UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAand Spanish (Muysken 2001:77), although the exact kind and degree of their
relationship still has to be explored.
It has become common usage to refer to the variety of the Titicaca region as
Uru, whereas Chipaya denotes the variety spoken in southwest Bolivia close to Lake
Coipasa. For further discussion of the denominations Uru and Uchumataqu, cf. 1.3.1.
Both varieties are structurally close to each other and with respect to phonology,
we may say that Uchumataqu and Chipaya are almost identical (at least from what
can be judged from the phonological information on Uchumataqu given in the
sources). However, with regard to morphology, Uchumataqu has certain morphemes
that do not occur in Chipaya, either because Uchumataqu preserved an older stage of
the language due to its isolation or, alternatively, Uchumataqu developed these
morphemes after its split from other Uru-Chipaya. These morphemes, then, are
unique to Uchumataqu. Among these unique morphemes are possibly the personal
pronoun of second person singular kun 'you', which appears to be restricted to
interrogative clauses. Another pronominal form is -wici, which can be described as
an original pronominal plural marker that was used to build niwici 'they' before
Aymara plural marker -naka took on this function. Morphemes that probably
developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya speaking groups had lost contact are
predicator -kasi, question bound topic marker -xwi, and In-Group marker -acu. The
non-existence of predicator -kasi in Chipaya relates to another difference: in
Uchumataqu, predicator -kasi distinguishes adjectives as a separate word class, while
in Chipaya adjectives form a subcategory of nouns (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:103) but
do not constitute a class of its own5. Uchumataqu resultative -/ resembles Aymara
resultative marker -ta to some degree and Chipaya seems to have borrowed the
Aymara marker. Thus, Uchumataqu -/ and Chipaya -ta are not entirely different but
contrast, just like Uchumataqu -t and the Aymara morpheme. It is possible that
Uchumataqu -t derives from the Aymara form and would be therefore a morpheme
that developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya had become separated.
One of the more crucial differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is the
locative marking system. As will be further outlined under 4.1.1.2 and 4.1.1.3,
Uchumataqu has two basic locative forms, which are -kis and -fa/, each of which has
an allomorph derived by metathesis: -kis I -ski and -fa/' / -sikf. The form -kis I -ski is
the directional locative, which marks a movement 'into X' with motion verbs, while
with stative or position verbs it is translated as 'in X'. The form -fa/' / -siki expresses
a locative and is always understood as 'in X'. I analyse this as a system in transition
(cf. 4.1.1). Chipaya also has two locative markers -kiz(i) and -kin(a), which do not
possess metathesised allomorphs. The form -kiz(i) refers to entities or objects being
close to the speaker, while -kin(a) marks entities or objects being away from the!
Chipaya preserves lexicalisations with -Un, a form that in Uchumataqu serves to create adjectival states,
which form a subcategory of adjectives In Uchumataqu, -/in was still productive at the time of
documentation, but lexicahsed forms with -Im exist too (for further discussion, cf 4 3 5) In Chipaya, it is
doubtful whether the form -tin is still productive Cerrón-Palomino (2006) does not interpret it as a
morpheme
It has to be noted that the interpretation of-ski and -siki as allomorphs is arguable It may possible that
both forms represent one morpheme and -ski is the same as -siki only with an unstressed -siCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION7speaker (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:128). Uchumataqu, too, uses a form -kina but it is
purely directional. Thus, the two systems are rather different. When I asked a native
speaker of Chipaya to translate the Uchumataqu expression wat-siki 'in the village'
(Uhle 1894:19), he understood it as 'the weave (el tejido)', thus analysing wat- as the
verb stem 'to weave', -s possibly as the action nominaliser followed by a linking
vowel -/', and topic marker -kf.
Another case of formally similar but functionally different suffixes are Chipaya
-z and Uchumataqu -s. Chipaya -z is analysed by Cerrón-Palomino (2006:159, 160)
as 'reflexivo-mediopasivo', while for Uchumataqu -s I propose an interpretation as
first person singular subject marker. Even if possible interpretation errors are left
aside, the fact remains that both suffixes appear in the same slot, are preceded and
followed by the same types of morphemes, and they even have similar allomorphs,
namely -zh in Chipaya and -s in Uchumataqu. Nonetheless, they cannot express the
same idea since Chipaya -z is not restricted to a particular person, whereas
Uchumataqu -s marks a first person singular as subject. Thus, formally they are
almost identical but differ considerably with respect to function.
One of the greatest differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is that the
latter has a gender distinction, which Uchumataqu entirely lacks. The Chipaya gender
distinction affects nouns, pronouns, and the personal clitics, although there is a
growing tendency to neglect the use of female pronouns, particularly with respect to
the plural form nanaka 'they (fern.)'. This may be due to a growing Spanish
influence on Chipaya, since in Spanish a group of men and women is referred to as
ellos 'they (masc.)'. Only if there is a group composed solely of women would the
female form ellas 'they (fern.)' be used. A similar use of ninaka 'they (masc.)' and
nanaka 'they (fern.)' can be observed in Chipaya8.
It is possible that some of the morphemes described as characteristic only for
Chipaya existed in Uchumataqu before it became highly endangered. Alternatively, it
is possible that they existed even at the time of documentation, but went unnoticed
because documentation would have required a long-term study of a wider range of
data including conversations between native speakers, story telling, etc. However,
given the high number of different morphemes or formally similar but functionally
different affixes, it seems doubtful that intelligibility between speakers of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya has ever been very high, despite Wachtel's observation
(1990:269) that during a recent meeting of Uchumataqu and Chipaya speakers both
groups could talk to each in ""Uru-Chipaya"". During field-work carried out in January
2006, I asked several native speakers of Chipaya to translate phrases and simple
clauses from Uchumataqu and the outcome was very different. In some cases, there
was hardly any or no understanding at all, while in other cases there was a certain
degree of intelligibility. However, the fact that some Uchumataqu phrases from UhleThe interpretation and transcription of these morphemes in Chipaya provided by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006) is slightly different: what I termed action nominaliser -s is labelled the ""infinitivizador"" -z(a)
(Cerrón-Palomino 2006 131), while what I analyse as a linking vowel -ι is termed by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006.87) as ""inflexion vocalica"" The interpretation of-Ai as topic marker is the same for Uchumataqu (cf.
7 2 2) and Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 175).

Personal communication with a native speaker of present-day Chipaya8UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAand Métraux could be interpreted by Chipaya speakers does not prove immediate
intelligibility since a French native speaker would probably understand the basic
meaning of a written Spanish text, even without knowledge of Spanish but that would
be probably quite different if (s)he were confronted with rapid, spoken Spanish. This
was actually the case when during field-work I asked the Chipaya native speakers to
listen to the Uchumataqu passages in Vellard's film: none of them could immediately
understand what has been said and it was only after several sessions that they had
gained a general idea of the Uchumataqu texts. That is, it has probably been possible
for an Uchumataqu native speaker to understand whether a Chipaya speaker talked
about his / her family, fanning, or the latest transactions made in La Paz, but details
may remain obscure.
1.1.3 Aymara, Spanish, and Quechua influence
Aymara is the language that had most influence on Uchumataqu, while Spanish
contributes mainly lexical items to the language, and Quechua can be regarded as
exerting only a minor influence. In some cases it is difficult or even impossible to
determine whether a feature is a loan or an areal phenomenon shared by many
Andean languages, since we have to take into consideration that these three
languages were neighbours for centuries or even millenia. I will discuss this further
below (cf. 1.3).
In Uchumataqu, influence from other languages is found mainly in the
phonology and morphology and, of course, its lexicon. I will first present loan
phenomena in phonology before turning to a brief description of morphological and
lexical loans.
One of the most remarkable changes brought forward by an increasing Aymara
influence is the reduction of the formerly 5-vowel system of Uchumataqu to a 3vowel system of the Aymara (and Quechua) type, i.e. from /a/, /e/, /il, lol, and /u/
reduced to /a/, HI, and Iwl (cf. Muysken 2001:82).
In other aspects of phonology, Spanish exerted influence on Uchumataqu.
Among the few sounds that are maintained in Spanish loan words are [b], [g], and [f],
although in the majority of all cases, loan words are adapted to Uchumataqu
phonology. These changes affect mainly sounds from Spanish loan words, but are
also applied to Aymara or Quechua words if their structure violates a phonological
rule of Uchumataqu. Thus, Aymara lluchu 'cap', for example, is changed to lukcu
(Polo 1901:470) since Uchumataqu does not allow [11] in word initial position. For a
more detailed description, cf. 2.6.
When looking at the bound grammatical morphemes of Uchumataqu, one finds
only a relatively small number that are actually borrowed from Aymara or Quechua.
Among the more recent loans we find affirmative -pini, whose use is testified only in
the material of Vellard9 (1949-1967), intensifier -paca, and plural marking -naka
used on personal pronouns. Other possibly less recent loans are resultative -t,
terminative -kama and benefactive -taki.","[22, 23, 24, 25]"

observations and is thus relevant for the lexicon only. So far, this has been the only

1.4.3 2 Colette Gnnevald Craig
Colette Grinevald has been working and publishing on a number of Meso- and South
American languages and is particularly concerned with field-work on endangered
languages. After having returned from the University of Oregon (where she worked
using the name Craig), she started working at the University of Lyon and since 1996
Grinevald is a member of the CNRS.
During the campaign ""normalización de los alfabetos"" initiated by the ministry
of education, Colette Grinevald was approached by community members of Irohito
and ask to extend the alphabétisation campaign to the village. During her visit to
Irohito133, Grinevald came into contact with Lorenzo Inda and two last speakers of
Uchumataqu. These last two speakers were siblings, he was about 87 and considered
to be the last speaker; his sister was about two years younger. As Grinevald points
out the last two speakers have deceased.
Grinevald's data on Uchumataqu consist of a questionnaire of 100 items, of
which 40 remained unanswered. The items are nouns and adjectives; the nouns
include kinship terms, body parts, plants and fruits as well as natural phenomena. The
adjectives consist of basic notions, such as 'good', 'bad', 'warm', and 'cold'. The
material also contains eleven drawings on everday items, such as clothes or rafts as
well as a number of birds and fish. With the exception of one brief phrase showing
the use of predicator -kasi the material is purely lexical. The data are unpublished and
are in the personal possession of the researcher134.
Another woman contributed some words to the questionnaire, too, but was not
officially interviewed; Grinevald judged her to be in her 60's, i.e. about one
generation younger than the speakers officially interviewed.
1.4.3.3 Pieter Muysken
Among other research areas, Pieter Muysken has worked and published on language
contact situations of Caribbean and South American languages. He works at the
Radboud University Nijmegen.
Pieter Muysken published an article based on Vellard's material on Uchumataqu
in 2000 {Drawn into the Aymara mold? Notes on Uni Grammar), in which he
describes features of Uchumataqu, such as reduplication, incorporation, suffixation,
and particularly the declarative Marker -cay, explaining possible links with Aymara.
In April and May 2001 Pieter Muysken visited Irohito and collected about 800
words on several semantic fields, such as kinship terms, body parts, plants and fruits
as well as numerals 1 to 20 and 100. He worked with several members of the
community, among them Lorenzo Inda and his nephew Cyriaco Inda as well as
Desiderio Lopez Inda, Nicolas Salinas, and Teodoro Vila. On a second visit in' "" Financial support was provided by UNICEF

I am very grateful to Colette Gnnevald who allowed me access to her material on Uchumataqu56UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAAugust 2001, Muysken met Teodoro Vila's older sister Julia Vila, who can be
described as the last speaker to be considerably fluent in Uchumataqu. Julia Vila
acquired Uchumataqu by her grandmother, who used this language when talking to
her. Julia Vila contributed a number of new words to the vocabulary and was also
able to produce a short text about the Uru's past and their ancient deity called
Uphana. Part of the results of this field-work campaign were published in 2001 under
the title El uchumataqu (Uru) de Irohito. Observaciones preliminares. Apart from
Julia Vila's story, the article is concerned with the genetic affiliation of Uru-Chipaya,
the current situation of Uchumataqu as well as phonological and grammatical
observations. Pieter Muysken returned to Irohito in March and April 2002 to present
and further check the vocabulary resulting from his first field trip to Irohito in 2001.
The most comprehensive part of the field-work results, however, was published
2005 in the form of a vocabulary titled El idioma Uchumataqu. It contains the
vocabulary mentioned above, and all in all there are 240 phrases and clauses. Some
of them are very brief and consist of two words only, while other are more elaborate
and include imperative and interrogative clauses. Furthermore, two songs recorded
with Lorenzo Inda in August 2001 are also included. A brief description of the
studies carried out on Uchumataqu so far as well as some texts published by Vellard
1949 are also provided.
It is the publication El idioma Uchumataqu that is considered for the current
work. The lexical material is part of the lexicon while the phrases and clauses are in
part considered for the grammatical description. However, one has to take into
consideration that the language has been dead for almost half a century in 2001 and
even Julia Vila probably did not make regular use of Uchumataqu. Therefore, the
phrases and clauses will only be considered when they can be confirmed by other
sources, e.g. Uhle or Métraux. Features found only in this most recent publication on
Uchumataqu can be ascribed to the strong Aymara influence on the remaining
speakers and their long disuse of Uchumataqu.","[71, 72, 73]"

"(Métraux 1935:104)Sentences such as (10) and (11) establish wata, iya, and aski as discrete lexical items,
whereas no similar case involving -kasi can be found. Thus, e.g. iya can be
established as a word, while -kasi cannot. Once word boundaries are established, they
can be further supported by morphological and even phonological evidence, such as
that e.g. declarative -cay is always word final, and that words do not begin with /r/.
3.2 Typological classification
Uchumataqu can be characterised as a moderately agglutinating language. Based on
the syntactic notion of word, a count of affixes per word results in the following
table. This counting was based on Vellard (1949), who is the only one to provide
entire texts and thus, instances of natural speech.
As shown in table 3.1, nominal, pronominal, adverbial, and adjectival stems are
either zero marked or tend to have only one grammatical morpheme attached. Verbal
stems, however, mainly carry at least one grammatical morpheme, but generally they
have two morphemes attached. Particles and numerals have a tendency to be zero
marked. Thus, the overall picture is somewhat different from Aymara and Quechua,
which generally show a higher number of affixes per word. However, like Quechua
and Aymara, Uchumataqu can be likewise classified as an agglutinating language.",[148]
"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS135Uchumataqu affixes can be characterised by the so-called ""relevance principle"", as
presented by Bybee (1985:15f): ""[...] semantic elements that are highly relevant to
one another are likely to be packaged together and expressed lexically, or will be the
most common inflectional or derivational categories."". That is, categories that are
generally thought of as most relevant, such as tense, aspect, mood, number, and case
are expressed in Uchumataqu as either derivational or inflectional (bound)
morphemes.
For the distinction between derivation and inflection, I would like to follow
Booij (2006:654, 656): ""The distinction between inflection and derivation is
primarily a functional one: it refers to different functions of morphological processes,
the creation of different forms of lexemes versus the creation of different lexemes."",
and further ""[...] derivation may change the syntactic category of its input forms,
whereas inflection is always category-neutral. [...] [I]nflection creates forms of the
same lexeme, unlike derivation, which determines the lexical category of the lexemes
it creates."". Thus, by derivation I understand that the application of a grammatical,
bound morpheme can change the syntactic category of its host. Inflectional affixes do
not have this ability.
Based on this definition, I view action nominaliser -s(i), subject relativiser -ni,
related State marking -tni (and its allomorph -tin) as well as causative -sna (and its
allomorph -ska) to be derivational. The following examples demonstrate their usage.
Both action nominaliser -s(i) and subject relativiser -ni nominalise a verb stem
and these suffixes thus match the criterion for derivational affixes. Please consider
examples (21) and (22).

verb stem to which -sna (or -ska) is attached remains a verb. However, attaching the
causative morpheme has syntactic and semantic implications, as expressed by Booij
(2006:656): ""[...] the derivation of causative verbs leads to the creation of transitive
verbs that indicate the obligatory presence of a direct object [...]. Hence, the
derivation of causative verbs has syntactic relevance."". Apart from this syntactic
impact, derivation of causative verbs often leads to a semantic difference, which
sometimes results in lexical causatives, such as e.g. 'to eat' and 'cause somebody to
eat = to feed'. The Uchumataqu causative fits into this scheme, since it introduces a
new participant286 and produces new lexical items.

(Uhle 1894:100)Example (27) presents a lexical causative:
(27)tiks-'to die'kona- 'to kill'(Métraux 1935:101, 108)Another possible example of a lexical causative is the verb skata- 'to send' (Vellard
1967:9), which could have been constructed of causative -ska and the verb ta: 'to
give', meaning 'to cause somebody to give = to send'. Problematic is that the
potential causative form precedes the verb stem, which otherwise must not be the
case. If skata- has indeed been derived this way, we may assume that it has been
completely lexicalised at the time of documentation. Since further examples are
missing, this has to remain speculative.
In sum, the majority of Uchumataqu affixes is inflectional and only the forms
discussed above are considered derivational.
With respect to the order of affixes, ""[i]t is often observed that derivational
morphemes occur closer to the root to which they attach than inflectional morphemes
do"" (Bybee 1985:33). In Uchumataqu, we find that on nouns and pronouns the plural
marker precedes case suffixes, which themselves can be followed by clausal clitics.
This observation is in accordance with Bybee's findings (1985:34)287. In most cases,
adjectives and adverbs are zero marked. However, if they take markers, we find a
situation similar to nouns, i.e. case markers (on adverbs) or predicator -kasi (on both
categories) are attached directly to the stem and can be followed by clausal clitics.
Only verbs tend to have a higher number of affixes, although it rarely exceeds two
affixes per verb stem. This limitation makes it somewhat difficult to determine the
position an affix can take, i.e. although it may be attached directly to the stem, it is
The form -sna occurs with (transitive) cognition (e.g. sis- 'to know') and utterance verbs (e.g. cis- 'to
speak') as well as with (intransitive) states, which then become transitive. Its allomorph -ska appears only
with (transitive) action and action-process verbs (e.g cer- 'to see, look at' and kos- 'to break')

"42UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAof Métraux's field trip (Métraux 1935:75, 76). The introduction is followed by a
detailed ethnographical description concerning the material culture: house types,
household goods, and tools as well as notes on the economic situation (hunting,
fishing, agriculture, livestock and cattle) (Métraux 1935:76-84). The following part
deals with the several uses of totora reeds, used for building rafts, plaits, and ropes
(Métraux 1935:84-86). A final section describes the clothing of the Uru (Métraux
1935:86f). On the next few pages Métraux (1935:87-89) is concerned with the social
and religious organisation of the Uru and also adds a brief section on their
""character"". The word list is preceded by some basic notes on the linguistic situation,
including a very brief comment on the phonological transcription system used (cf.
chapter 2). Métraux (1935:89) observes that the Uru would not use their ancient
language any more but spoke Aymara even among themselves. A somewhat
contradictory statement is that Métraux considered Uchumataqu to be ""purer""99 than
closely related Chipaya, which he explained by the fact that Ancoaqui and Irohito are
geographically close to important Uru centres of Lake Titicaca (ibid.). Métraux
supplies photos of Uchumataqu speakers and detailed drawings on tools and
household goods throughout his ethnographic description.
The word list itself (Métraux 1935:90-110) is French-Uru and ordered
alphabetically. It contains 631 lexical items of all word classes, i.e. verbs from every
class, adjectives, adverbs of time, manner and degree as well as nouns. The latter
cover all possible semantic fields, as there are: body parts, kinship terms, clothing,
food, illness, tools and appliances, balsa rafts, domesticated and non-domesticated
animals as well as natural and astronomical phenomena. Métraux also provides
personal and interrogative pronouns, directional adverbs, short phrases of everyday
life, and numerals 1 to 23, 100, 1.000 and 10.000. However, Métraux made only very
basic grammatical observations, such as that e.g. -kin is a suffix meaning 'to, toward'
(Métraux 1935:109).
Apart from a mere word list Métraux provides almost 200 additional explicative
clauses to the majority of his lexical data. These clauses and phrases aim to show the
use of a certain item in various contexts, e.g. in interrogative or imperative clauses.
Thus, we find eighteen clauses exemplifying the use of the verb 'to go'. Example
clauses occur with several kinds of lexemes, but particularly with the following
verbs: 'to have'100; 'to kill'; 'to hit, beat'; 'to come'; 'to put'; 'to see'; 'to make'; 'to
want'; 'to eat'; 'to leave'. The interrogative pronoun 'who?' is likewise explained in
greater detail. The example clauses are of varying length and complexity.
Métraux's work is primarily a word list, which may be the reason why it has not
been considered for subsequent publications on Uchumataqu. That is, neither
LaBarre (1941), Palavecino (1949) nor Vellard (1949-67) mention it as a source of
their works and recent studies (e.g. Torero 2002) refer only to Uhle ( 1894), Lehmann
(1929), or Vellard but neglect Métraux's word list. Although Métraux's study on
Uchumataqu has always been underestimated, it contains highly valuable linguistic

Uchumataqu was less influenced by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish than Chipaya

The notion of 'to have' is expressed by a construction involving benefactive -fail and the copulative
verb sel- 'to be'CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION43(and ethnographic) information. As already mentioned above, his language
consultants must have been ftilly competent native speakers of Uchumataqu, to which
the complexity of several of the example clause points. Not only is the old
pronominal plural marker -wici present in Métraux's data, Métraux is, apart from
Uhle, the only researcher to report vocalisation (cf. 2.12.1.2). Almost all grammatical
interpretations obtained by an analysis of Métraux's example clauses are congruent
with Uhle's findings and can be verified by them. The lexical material provided by
Métraux agrees to a high proportion with the lexical data given by e.g. Lehmann
(1929b). It is a general observation that there is a gap between material recorded
before 1931 and material recorded after this time. This gap is found in the lexicon but
to a the larger degree it occurs with grammatical morphemes. That is, certain features
present in the documents from 1894 to 1935 are not found in Vellard's work, while
Vellard reports characteristics that seem to be of recent origin, since neither Uhle
(1894), Lehmann (1929), or Métraux (1935) mentions them.
To conclude, I regard Métraux's material to be highly reliable and informative.
Together with Uhle's manuscript Métraux's data form 'core information' on
Uchumataqu. However, as other works of his time, Métraux's article shows the same
lack of information on his language consultants, languages used during the recording
process, and the general circumstances of his field-work. Furthermore, the time he
spent in Ancoaqui was rather short and he did not pay a second visit. From a presentday point of view, this can be considered a significant failure in the process of data
collection.
1.4.2.5 Jehan (Jean) A. Vellard (1901-1996)
Jehan Albert Vellard was bom in Béja, Tunesia, in 1901101 (Dollfus 1996:165) and
between 1940 and 1943 he was director of the National Museum in La Paz (Dollfus
1996:166). During this time he collected part of his data on Uchumataqu presented
below. Vellard's anthropological interest made him a lecturer for social anthropology
at the University of San Marcos and the Catholic University in Lima102. Finally,
Vellard also founded the Institut français d'Études andines (Dollfus 1996:166). He
died in Argentina in 1996 (Dollfus 1996:167).
Vellard is the only researcher ever to have carried out intensive field-work on
the Uru and correspondingly, he presents abundant material on ethnography and
linguistics. Between 1938 and 1952 he visited Irohito several times (see tab. 1.4),
although he possibly did not collect linguistic data on every visit. Vellard is also the
only researcher to present background information on his language consultants and
1
' As other researchers introduced in this section, he did not study social anthropology or linguistics, but
instead received a degree in medicine at the age of 24 (ibid.) However, the stations of his career are quite
diverse and include the position of an assistant at the Butantan Institute in Sâo Paulo between 1925 and
1929, the employment at the Museum of Natural History in Paraguay (1930-1932), the position of head of
department for immunology in Fernambuco and head of the zoological department at the University of
Tucumân.
102

The core function of adjectives is to qualify a noun, but for many languages it is
problematic to state whether they have a separate class of adjectives or not.
Adjectives sometimes stand between nouns and verbs, and in many languages
concepts that in other languages are expressed as adjectives are encoded as either
nouns or verbs; and often the situation is not entirely clear.
In Uchumataqu, adjectival concepts are in general not encoded as verbs429, but
the situation is not so clear when it comes to the difference between nouns and
adjectives. In the following I will discuss whether Uchumataqu has a separate class
of adjectives or not 430 .
There are some morphosyntactic and semantic means to state whether a
language has adjectives. The most common way to do so is to look at morphology,
' l29 In fact, there are at least two adjectival concepts that are encoded verbally. These are 'to be tired' ocand 'to be ill' asi- Maybe also the notion of 'to be sad' is expressed verbally but there the situation is not
entirely clear. These cases are viewed as exceptions but not as a general means to express adjectival
concepts.
""""This discussion is limited to ""descriptive adjectives"" because ""limiting adjectives"" (Dixon 1982:3) as
numbers and expressions such as 'this','other', or 'much' behave morphologically different (cf 4 2 3;
4.3.4, 4.4)198UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAi.e. do nominal markers also attach to adjectival concepts? Or are adjectival concepts
morphologically marked distinctly from nouns?
As Croft (2003:185) points out for a theory of markedness, adjectives are
prototypically morphologically unmarked in modifying position, but they are marked
when used as nouns or in predicative function. Nouns, on the other hand, derived
from adjectives are marked as derivations, e.g. 'happi-ness' in English (2003:185).
Another characteristic of adjectives is their ability to function in comparative
constructions (Schachter 1985:14).
With regard to semantics Dixon (1982:13) points out that if a language has
adjectives at all, at least the concepts of dimension (e.g. tall), colour (e.g. red) and
value (e.g. good) as a universal tendency, will be encoded as adjectives ('Languages
that have only a limited class of adjectives show considerable similarity in the
concepts that are expressed through adjectives.' Dixon 1982:3). Furthermore, if there
exists a class of adjectives there tend to be antonyms.
In Uchumataqu, adjectival concepts are not marked for case suffixes or the
plural marker -naka. The only morphological markers they have in common with
nouns are clausal clitics such as declarative -cay and Topic marker -ki.
With regard to morphological marking, adjectival concepts in a modifying
position usually do not take morphological markers at all. In predicative function
they often take the predicator -kasi (cf. 4.3.2.1), which also occurs on e.g. manner
adverbs, such as e.g. nisu-kasi 'so' 431 . Adjectives can be further modified by adverbs.
The adverb iya 'more' is used to increase the degree of the meaning embodied in
an adjectival concept and in this sense contributes to some kind of comparison (122).
For true comparisons between two entities separative -kistana is used (cf. 4.1.1.4).

"CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION15Our most reliable information on the Uru in pre-colonial times is from sources
written in the Ιό* and 17th century, i.e. from a time when the Spanish were about to
understand and administer their newly conquered colony. Some passages in these
documents (e.g. Gavilân [1621] 1988:85) point to the possibility that, just as the
Aymara, the Uru were once just another ethnic group of Bolivia, which lived all over
the Altipiano, always close to (or even on) the rivers and lakes. This stretch of Uru
population on the Lakes Titicaca, Ροορό, and Coipasa and along the Desaguadero
River was titled ""aquatic axis"" by Nathan Wachtel (1986:283). However, the sources
also suggest that already in pre-Spanish times, the Uru had to suffer from the Inca
system of mitimaes, i.e. the resettlement of ethnic groups in order to stabilise the Inca
empire. In the Relation de los pacajes Mercado de Pefialosa ([1586] 1965:336,
translation mine) points to this: ""[...] and when the Inca came conquering this
province of the Pacaxes, they made these Uru, who were close to the water, leave
[the water] and made them live with the Aymara and taught them to plough and
cultivate the earth and they forced them to pay tribute in fish and make cases of
straw.""19. Thus, even during the Inca reign, the Uru were forced to abandon their
lifestyle (and with it probably their language) and it is possible that the negative
attitude towards the fishing and hunting Uru often found in colonial sources indeed is
from the Inca, which, as farmers and stockbreeders may have had prejudices against
the Uru. Thus, the situation of the Uru today is not a recent development but has its
roots in Inca times.
However, since reports about the Uru in the pre-Spanish era are not many, I will
tum now to the description of the Uru as given in colonial sources, covering the 16th
and 17th centuries. These early documents can be roughly split into two groups:
chronicles and description of travels on the one hand, and administrative documents
concerned with taxation and number of inhabitants on the other. According to the
different nature of these documents, their reports on the Uru focus either on their
distinct culture and compare them to the Aymara and Quechua population, or they
just give the number of persons classified as Uru and the amount of tax they have to
payOne of the earliest documents to mention them is the Visita a Chucuito
([1567/68] 1964), carried out by Garci Diez de San Miguel (1567/68), which is an
administrative document concerned with taxation. There, the designation Uru refers
to the lowest class of taxation20 but is not primarily the name for an ethnic group. A
similar use of the name Uru is found in the Tosa de Visita General del Toledo
([1573-75] 1975), which is also an administrative document.
Another important colonial document are the Relaciones Geograficas de Indias.Peru (Cook et al. [1586] 1965). On behalf of the viceroy Francisco de Toledo
officials visited virtually every settlement of 'New Spain' and counted taxable21
inhabitants and their belongings, goods, cattle, fields, etc. They also paid a visit to the
"" ""[ ] y cuando los ingas vimeron conquistando esta provincia de los Pacaxes, hicieron salir a estos
indios Uros de junto al agua y les hicieron vivir con los aymaras y les enseflaron a arar y cultivar la tierra y
les mandaron que pagasen de tributo pescado y hiciesen petacas de paja "" For Pacajes, cf below
20
It is noteworthy that a similar observation was made by Bacarreza (1910 61), almost 400 years later.

Referring only to men over age 1716UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAdepartment of the Pacajes and gave detailed description of the villages there. One of
these is Machaca, where an Uru population of 270 taxable persons is counted
(Mercado de Pefialosa [1586] 1965:336), living among an Aymara population, which
outnumbered the Uru almost 1 to 10. Mercado de Pefialosa also provides evidence
that this was a situation brought forward by the Inca policy of resettlement (quoted
above). Apart from the remarkable change in economy, the forced vicinity to the
Aymara also caused the Uru to give up their language, which, according to de
Pefialosa, was Puquina, and they turned to Aymara instead (ibid.).
The Relaciones Geograficas de Indias mention only two more settlements with
Uru populations in the Titicaca region. One of them is Tiwanaku23, where about 100
Uru were counted (ibid.). The other village is Waki and although de Pefialosa does
not give numbers of the Uru population, his note on the Waki Uru is striking. The
official explains that there was only few native livestock, but instead the Uru were
breeding great quantities of pigs. Thus, it seems the Uru people of Waki had quickly
abandoned the traditional economy and successfully adapted a new lifestyle.
The Spanish officials immediately adopted the Inca policy of resettling ethnic
groups and started their program of the so-called 'reductions' (reducciones). By this,
groups formerly living scattered were forced to move close together into a
(sometimes newly founded) village24. These groups were often of different ethnic
backgrounds and so, Uru who had not been affected by the Inca resettlements, came
now into the focus of the Spanish reducciones and were forced to move into Aymara
villages. This, of course, almost always meant the end to the traditional water-centred
lifestyle of the Uru, an aspect Fray Reginaldo de Lizarraga points to in his
Descripcion breve del Peru ([1608] 1968:67, translation mine): ""The reduction made
them [the Uru KH] eat bread and drink wine, and for the doctrine that was the most
important. But look at them before dawn in their balsa rafts, nearly naked, steering
and fishing [...].""25
Despite these measures, Uchumataqu must still have had a broader spread at the
end of the 16th century, as can be assumed by the Copia de Curatos ([1596] 1982)26
(cf. Torero 2002:467, 468). This document was made for Christian missionaries and
lists the languages that were spoken in the Altipiano villages, so that the missionaries
knew which language(s) to use for preaching. The Copia de Curatos mentions
Aymara, Quechua, Pukina, and Uruquilla, i.e. Uchumataqu and Chipaya, as the
languages that had to be used for missionary work (Torero 2002:468). Thus,
Uchumataqu as well as Chipaya must still have been of importance then.
Part of the Uru population resisted Spanish domination and tried to maintain
their original lifestyle (together with their language), which is reported by Alonso
22The area around Lake Titicaca, and which today forms part of the department La Paz
Centred around the famous ruins of the same name
24
By this process, the village of Santa Ana de Chipaya was founded m the 1 ö* century
25
""Les ha aprovechado la reducción para que coman pan y beban vino, y para la doctrina ha sido lo
principal Pero verlos antes que amanezca en sus balsas de totora, casi desnudos, navegar y pescar [. ] ""
The meaning of amanezca, which is translated as the verb 'dawn', is not entirely certain. It may refer, in a
somewhat poetic style, to the time before the Spanish conquerers arrived and brought what they
understood to be civilisation

23CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION17Ramos Gavilân in the Historia del santuario de Nuestra Senora de Copacabana
([1621] 1988:82, 355). In August of 1618, a group of Urn fortified an island in the
mouth of the Desaguadero River near Cepita and denied access to the Spanish,
defending their place of retreat with arms. They also went plundering on nearby
estates and villages. The Uru were eventually defeated by Miguel de Andrada, but
this shows that at least parts of the Uru population tried to escape reductions,
aymaricisation and hispanicisation.
This struggle for independence made it possible for some Uru groups to
maintain their traditional lifestyle and language, an aspect remarked upon by e.g.
Reginaldo de Lizârraga Descripción breve de toda la tierra del Peru ([1608] 1968)
and Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa Compendio y descripción de las Indias
Occidentales ([1628] 1948). However, violent actions, the completely different
lifestyle of the Uru together with their distinct language created a negative attitude
towards them. Lizarraga ([1608] 1968:67, translation mine) characterises the Uru as
""most barbaric people, with a language different from all others of the mainland and
from that of the Inca; they understood it very little, they knew it little, [...].""27. A
similar view is uttered by Antonio de Castro y del Castillo, author of the Descripción
del Obispado de la Paz ([1651] 1906:201, 202, translation mine): ""they are like the
others, but less cultured; they fish and cruise the bay with balsa rafts [...].""28.
In sum, the arrival of the Spanish and the colonial administration fuelled a
process that had already begun in pre-Spanish times, namely the Urus' forced
adaptation to a farming lifestyle, which brought with it the loss of their language.
However, parts of the Uru resisted this process and managed to maintain their
lifestyle, for which, however, they were despised by other indigenous groups and the
Spanish. Thus, by the second half of the 17th century, Uru groups living a traditional
life became more and more scattered, the contact between southern groups around
Lakes Coipasa and Ροορό and the Titicaca region was probably severly interrupted,
and whenever they had to make contact with outsiders they had to use Aymara (or
sometimes Quechua). This situation may be regarded as the base for the further decay
of the Uru culture.
1.3.3 The Uru in the IS""1 and ΙΡ""1 century
The following two centuries saw a rapid decrease in numbers not only of the Uru
population but of virtually all indigenous groups in the Andean region. However, the
Uru were affected most due to their always small numbers and in some areas the Uru
population was entirely extinguished, as pointed out by Choque Canqui (2003:227).
That is, economic, political, and social pressure increased until most Uru had
assimilated to the Aymara lifestyle and became farmers and stockbreeders, adopting
the culture and language of their Aymara neighbours and melted with them. This
happened e.g. to the 90 Uru members of the ayllu Ancoaqui29 which in 1792 had
27""[ ··] gente barbarisima, con lengua differente de los demâs de la tierra firme y la del Inga, muy raros la
entendian, ni sabian, [...]."" The language of the Inca refers to Quechua.

whose members are often related.","[31, 32, 33, 34]"

'fever (lit.: heat)'(Vellard 1951:22)As has been mentioned above adjectival states do not take nominal or adjectival
marking and thus the question arises on which basis these forms can be termed
'adjectival'. It has been outlined in greater detail in chapter 3.6.2 that their most
important function is to modify nouns. This ability places -tni I -tin marked States
close to prototypical adjectives. Please consider examples (158) and (159).

NEG fertile woman
'an infertile woman; a barren woman'(Métraux 1935:90)k'utini luli-cay
warm food-DEC
'it is a warm meal'(Vellard 1950:81)Apart from their functional properties the semantic content of adjectival states further
suggests that it is better to treat them as adjectives. That is, they express a state which
is so permanent or characteristic that it can be understood as a typical property of
somebody or something. A somewhat exceptional case is the expression katni
(Métraux 1935:102) or ka:tin (Vellard 1950:64) 'snow', which does not describe a
property but refers to a noun. It is the only instance where a -tni I -tin marked State is
translated as a noun. However, in all other cases adjectival states refer to properties
and physical properties are encoded as adjectives in Uchumataqu (please recall table
4.17). Therefore, it seems justified to consider adjectival states as a subcategory of
adjectives, although they are not inflected with predicator -kasi.
In contrast to prototypical adjectives, States marked by -tni I -tin at first sight do
not seem to form an open class. What points to a possibly closed class of adjectival
states is that (with one exception) only action and action-process verbs are inflected
with State marking -tni I -tin while other semantic verb classes are not. However,
most expressions carrying -tni I -tin are lexicalised and it is impossible to establish
the underlying verb stem. This observation suggests that derivation of adjectival
states by means of applying -tni I -tin was not productive any more at the time of
documentation, which may further explain the relatively small number of actual
instances found and repeated citations of the same form. Thus, I would like to ascribe
the small set of items and the restricted applicability of -tni I -tin to a lexicalisation
process completed before the first documentation rather than to adjectival states
forming a closed class.
4.4 The numeral system
The Uchumataqu numeral system is a decimal one, as is shown in the way of
building numbers higher than ten. Numbers up to 99 are built on the base of qhalo
'ten'. In Uchumataqu we find the following numerals:UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA208(160)ci

where possessive -ci marks possession on the possessed (cf. 4.1.2.1).

inflected with -ci. However, possessive -ci is not attached to 20, 30, 40, etc (example
162). These are built in the way of digit-ten without taking possessive -ci.
Cardinal numbers 200 to 900 are built in the way of: digit-hundred, without
possessive -ci (164). One hundred itself is expressed as qhalo qhalo (lit: 'ten ten') or
with the Aymara ioanpataka.

"CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION5the personal clitics -/, -m, and -s, which refer to first, second, and third person,
respectively. Although their usage in the sources appears to be mainly emphatic,
there are also hints that these clitics had a person marking function in a more intact
stage of Uchumataqu. This is particularly reflected in interrogative and imperative
clauses. Uchumataqu is predominantly an SOV language but it allows great variation
with respect to word order. Interrogative devices are the interrogative pronouns and
the use of question markers -ta and -xwi; the latter is an allomorph of topic marker -ki
used in questions. In most cases, declarative -cay does not occur in interrogative
clauses, although there are some yes / no questions in which it is used. Although the
number of relative clauses is severely limited in my data, it appears that they are built
with nominalising subject relativiser -ni and are prenominai in nature, corresponding
to the basic SOV word order. The available examples suggest that relativisation in
Uchumataqu is restricted to subjects.
1.1.1 Genetic affiliation
As has been mentioned at the beginning of this section, Uchumataqu and Chipaya
(subsumed as Uru-Chipaya; cf. below) are considered to belong to an isolated
language family. However, several propositions concerning the genetic affiliation of
Uru-Chipaya have been made. Crequi-Montfort and Rivet (1925-27) suggested that
they are related to Pukina, a language mentioned by Ore (1607) that became extinct
in the 17th century. This suggestion was probably inspired by the name Pukina given
to Uchumataqu by the speakers themselves (cf. 1.3.1). The same authors (1926:121139, 1927:57-69) also brought into discussion a possible genetic relationship between
Uru-Chipaya and the Arawakan language family. However, none of these theories
could last. Olson (1964, 1965; quoted in Muysken 2001:76) proposed that (Uru)Chipaya had affinities with the Mayan languages of Meso America, a theory likewise
rejected today (cf. Campbell 1973, Adelaar and Muysken 2004). Fabre (1991)
presented an etymological vocabulary, in which he deals with Uru-Chipaya
(including Murato), the Jaqi language family, Quechua, the Pano-Takana language
family, and an Arawakan language. This approach is further developed in his article
Lexical similarities between Uru-Chipaya and Pano-Takanan languages: Genetic
relationship or areal diffusion? (1995), but so far no genetic affiliation could be
substantiated. Thus, it appears best to refer to Uru-Chipaya as an isolated language
family of the Bolivian Altipiano (Muysken 2001:76).
1.1.2 Uchumataqu compared with Chipaya
Chipaya is the only member of the Uru-Chipaya4 linguistic family that is still in use
today. It has approximately 1,800 native speakers in the communitiy Santa Ana de
Chipaya near Lake Coipasa in southwest Bolivia. Chipaya is highly endangered due
to an increasing influence of Spanish in modem Bolivian society and a shift to
Aymara. Uchumataqu and Chipaya are considered to be as closely related as French4In 2001 the Nacwn Originaria Um (NOU) was formed in Oraro and consists of several groups, who
consider themselves to be of Uru origin. However, none of them speaks a Uru-Chipaya language any
more, with the exception of the Chipaya.","[21, 22]"
