"129This disscrtation has also shown that Kadiwéulacks prepositions entirely. and that the structuresanalyzed by Griffiths as containing prepositional phrases are actually biclausal. The fact that adverbs can
modify either of the lexical heads comprising those structures indicates that we are dealing with two verbs
rather than with a verb and a preposition. Moreover, relativization also indicates that we are dealing with
biclausal structures. The structures discussed in this paper have many of the properties attributed to SVCs
across languages: arguments must be shared, the negation of one head implies the negation of the whole
string, and the actions expressed by serial verbs are simultaneous. Further fieldwork will be necessary to
test whether pronominals can also be considered arguments in SVCs.","[138, 139]"
"The complement of copular clauses in Kadiwéu is always a noun phrase. Kadiwéu does not have adjectives: all
non-verbal roots have identical syntactic properties. Elements which are expressed by adjectives in languages like
English are expressed by nouns (168-169) or intransitive verbs (170-171)in Kadiwéu (see 4.4 for criteria forlexical category classification).",[80]

SVCs are documented solely in Africa, China, andSoutheast Asia, and in creole languages. Moreover.",[117]
"Parameters place limits on the ways in which languages may differ, thereby reducing the number of
grammatical hypotheses a child might consider in the course of language acquisition. Thus. the hypothesis
developed in this chapter has implications for language acquisition. According to Radford (1990:199).
""the earliest grammars developed by young children are purely lexical in nature"". That is, according to
Radford. child language is purely a projection of lexical categories. If this is true. we might expect
children to first assume that there are no pronominal argument languages. A question for further research
concerns the extent to which the grammatical development of children acquiring Kadiwéu is parallel to
that of children acquiring (for instance) European languages.",[137]
"3.3. SummaryIn this chapter [ have given a detailed description of the grammatical morphemes found in the noun and in the
verb. The verb structure is very complex, encoding person and number, directionals, mood, negation. and aspect.
The noun encodes possessives, classifiers, diminutive, and number.",[73]
"However, it is a characteristic of SVCs that the negation of one verb implies in the negation ofthe whole string (Sebba 1987).",[115]
"4.4.1. Valency. The term valency is derived from chemistry and is often used in linguistics to refer
to the number and type of bonds which the verb may form with a number of dependent elements referred
to as arguments (Crystal1985). This definition, however, is ambiguous, because transitivity can bedefined in the same way. In this work, I use valency to refer exclusively to the syntactically relevant
components of meaning specified in the Lexicon of a language.
I will represent valency using predicate decomposition of a traditional LCS, although valency as meant
by Thomason et. al is probably more complex than a LCS. I frame valency using LCSs because they can
capture the facts that I discuss here. Thus, rather than attempting to develop a theory of the lexical
representations, I make only those assumptions that are necessary for the issues under investigation.",[119]
"This is because all the proper names used in the body of this dissertation come from Portuguese and the
pronounciation of this words varies from speaker to speaker according to their knowledge of Portuguese. It
is impossible, therefore, to propose a unique phonological representation for these words.",[142]

"Most Kadiwéu verbs are not lexically specified for direction. The directionof the action is expressed by means of a prefix and a set of derivational enclitics. Another set of derivational
enclitics, which must precede the directional clitics. can be used to create motion verbs. [ classify these morphemes
as derivational because they can change the meaning of the verbal stem (note the meaning shift in 108). Like any
other enclitic in Kadiwéu, they trigger deletion of sonorant consonants. Table 8 presents the motion and direction
enclitics and prefix and 102-112 present some examples.",[63]

"Questions regarding categorical distinctions have occupied a central place in linguistics. Chomsky
(1986b and later works)makesa distinction betweenlexical categories. which are defined over thefeatures [+/-noun, +/-verb], and functional categories, which include the following grammatical elements:
complementizer, determiner, tense, and light verbs. According to Chomsky, cross-linguistic differences
are not random. but they are confined to a specific component of grammar. The parametric variation
across languages lies in inflectional categories rather than in lexical categories. Therefore, the proposal
that Salishan languages lack a lexical contrast between nouns and verbs is incompatible with Chomsky's
proposal.",[118]

constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO, while the constituent order of
subordinate clauses is always VSO. My data shows that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses is much
freer than Griffiths reports. Possible orders are OVS, VOS, SOV. OSV, VSO, and SVO. The high frequency of
SVO order in Griffiths’ publications seems to be biased by elicitation technique: I have found that Kadiwéu
speakers tend to translate Portuguese sentences with SVO order. The problem is that, although one can translate
Portuguese sentences word-by-wordinto Kadiwéu,proportion of the constituent order of Kadiwéu,the resulting set of Kadiwéuwhich has muchsentencesreflects a smallfreer order.

"1285. ConclusionIn this dissertation I have provided a grammar of a little-known language of the Waikuruan family.
Chapter 2 offers a description of the Kadiwén phonology, from both synchronic and diachronic grounds.
Kadiwéu has two dialects which reflect gender and social status: the most salient differences between
Noble and Non-noble Kadiweéu are at the level of suprasegmental phonology. Noble Kadiwéu parses the
word into binary trochees. Non-noble Kadiwéu presents a rare stress system: it parses the word into
iterative ternary feet. Comparison of Kadiwéu prosody with the prosody of the other Waikurian languages
suggests that Non-noble Kadiwéu stress patterns were introduced through interference from Portuguese
and/or Spanish. Chapter 3 comprises a detailed description of the grammatical morphemes found in thenoun and in the verb.
In chapter 4 [ discuss aspects of Kadiwéu morphosyntax. | present evidence that pronominal clitics
and affixes are arguments in Kadiwéu, and that nominal phrases are optionally adjoined to the sentence.","[137, 138]"
"My research also contributes to the maintenance of Kadiwéu. Bilingual education is crucial for the maintenance
of languages whose speakers have been in contact with speakers of dominant languages for years. The Kadiwéu
Indians have been interested in bilingual education, but there is almost no specialized work on this language which
could help in the preparation of pedagogical materials. The grammar and dictionary that I have prepared could be
used by the Indians and by Brazilian scholars engaged in bilingual education.",[17]
"By contrast, the actions expressed by verbs in a SVC are simultaneous, they express only one event.and all verbs must be interpreted as having the same tense/aspect. The same pattern has been observed in
other serializing languages (Sebba 1987).",[115]
"HigI assume that a lexical representation of a verb must encode a representation of the element of meaning
that sets the state or event expressed by that verb (represented here simply as STATE and LOCATION)
and a set of primitives predicates that represent syntactic generalizations of the meaning of a verb (I will
use the predicates cause and becometo represent these primitive predicates). A LCS encodes alsoinformation about the semantic participants of an event which can be filled or satisfied in syntax: external
argument, represented as the subject of cause (x); internal direct argument. represented as the subject of
become (y): and indirect external argument. represented as z.
I make a distinction between semantic participants and grammatical arguments. Semantic participants
are the arguments present in a LCS. Grammatical arguments are those which actually appear in syntax.
This allows for an lexical entry to have semantic arguments appearing in their LCS which are not mapped
in syntax. Thus. for instance, the verb eat is bivalent; that is, it requires two semantic arguments —- the
one who causes the action of eating (x) and the one which becomes eaten (v). In syntax, however. eat
sometimes have only one grammatical argument (e.g. John ate). Although semantically eat has two
arguments (we understand that John (x) ate something (y)). syntactically eat may have only one argument
(x). The distinction between semantic participants and grammatical argumentsis fundamentalfor alanguage as Kadiwéu because in Kadiwéu there is a frequent mismatch between semantic participants and
grammatical arguments. as will be seen in 4.4.2.
In Kadiwéu any root can appear in a predicate. But certain roots must be modified by the suffixes
glossed in Table 14 as [+cause] and as [+become] in order to appear in a predicate. Compare examples
278 and 279, the root in 279 must be followed the suffix -ti. [ assume that cause and become are a
fundamental part of the meaning of a verb and [ propose that the suffixes in Table 14 operate on the LCS
of an lexical entry, adding or deleting cause and become. On this hypothesis, the root in 278 is a verb
and the root in 279 is a noun. The addition of -ti introduces cause and an external argument licensing a
noun to occur as the head of a predicate.","[119, 120]"

ambiguous interpretations, since the adverb can be interpreted as being associated with either the main or
the subordinate verb (Shibatani1976). Thus,for instance, in Kadiwéu,as in English,in one of theinterpretations of the biclausal structure in 242 silently modifies the verb make and the sentence means
that John was silent when he made Mary come into the room. In the other interpretation the adverb
modifies come and the sentence means that Mary came into the room silently.”","[105, 106]"
"morphemes). Valency suffixes license semantic arguments and they are probably added in the lexicon of
Kadiwéu. The transitivivizing morphemes -d: ‘theme’. -gi 'goal'. -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma
‘benefactive’. -k ‘allative’. and /okom ‘adessive' license grammatical arguments.
This result has implications for language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994
prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose argumentsarepronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. I have proposed a
parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui & Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument
languages. I argued that these languages are languages in which lexical categories do not project. On this
hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent lexical item to
adjoin a functional category that functions as a light verb. Light verbs enable valent elements to thetaassign.","[136, 137]"

3. Verb and Noun MorphologyThe structure of the verb seems to be similar in all the Waikurdan languages.* The verb agrees with the subject
and object in person and number (sg/pl). Kadiwéu, Toba, and Mocovi mark subject person with prefixes. but
number (pl) is marked with a suffix immediately following the root, althoughin Kadiwéu the pluralizingmorpheme for the third-person subject of transitive and unaccusative verbs is a prefix. All Waikurian languages
have a directional prefix n- ‘hither’ which is added to a verb stem. They also have a set of enclitics which mark
direction and motion. Aspect and mood, but not tense, are marked on the verb in Waikurian languages. Kadiwéu
has seven aspect markers -- completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive. and intensive — and two
mood markers. conditional and desiderative. There are also three negation markers.","[49, 50]"

phrases can be ordered freely with respect to each other and the verb.","[96, 97]"
"Indeed. Griffiths 1991 analyzes examples 237-239 as containingprepositional phrases, rather than verbs with ""preposition-like properties”. However, the fact that a word
can be translated as a preposition does not mean that that word is a preposition. The first problem that we
face in analyzing roots like -ati, ka-. and d:i- as prepositions is that we will have to postulate that
Kadiwéu has homophonous verbs and prepositions, because 240 and 241 show that such roots can
function as main verbs.",[105]

"*7The parametric variation proposed here is substantially different the one in Baker 1994. My proposalcan account for the existence of languages in which pronominals, rather than nominal phrases. are verbal
arguments. It does not mean that languages in which a small pro is an argument do not exist. But if they
do, they cannot be derived from the same parametric variation. Baker (personal communication,1995)mentions that there are at leat two types of nonconfigurational languages: (a) languages which have empty
categories pro as arguments and whose verbs are overtly marked by agreement (Mohawk),and (b)languages whose verbal arguments are pro, but whose verbs are not marked by agreement morphemes(Jiwarli). Jiwarli does not have bound pronominals, but it shares a remarkable number of features with
languagesas Mohawk.",[147]
"The sentences in 243 and 244 behave like biclausal structures with respect to adverbial modification.
In 243 the adverb can be understood as modifying either -ba 'find’ or ka- 'locative'. When it modifies -ba.
the sentence means that the act of Mary finding the dog was silent. In the other interpretation the adverb
modifies ka- 'locative' and the sentence means that the dog was silent under the table.",[106]

"Thomason et al. 1994 show that the facts of at least one Salishan language can be better understood if
valency and transitivity are distinguished. Thomason et al. maintain that verbs are associated with two
representations: a representation that encodes the number of arguments a verb requires, given its meaning.
and a second representation that encodes the syntactically relevant argument-taking properties of a verbAccording to Thomason et al.'s proposal, Montana Salish differs from better-known languages in that only
valency is a lexical property that is inherent to Salishan verbs; transitivity is assigned in syntax via
transitivizing morphemes.

Braggio 1981, Griffiths 1973, 1987, 1991) served as a guide for hypothesis formation at different stages of data
collection.
In the first part of the research (1993), I concentrated on the collection of words for a formal description of
the phonology and morphology and for the development of a dictionary. [ first collected basic words. guided by
Kaufman & Berlin's lexical checklist (around 2,000 words): I also used books containing pictures of plants.
animals, and birds from western lowland South America (Magalhaes 1992, Bertelli 1984) and a dictionary of verbs
containing 4,500 entries (Noble & Lacasa 1992) for more specific lexical elicitation in those domains.
I concentrated on the analysis of the morphosyntax in the second part of the research (1994-1995). I have
collected an extensive set of sentences and texts. Elicitation of isolated sentences was crucial to fill gaps in
morphological paradigms and to apply syntactic tests to test my hypotheses. I also collected historical narratives
and folk tales from some of the village storytellers, since I wanted my work to contribute some information about

"In addition to the basicdescriptive study, I have investigated selected topics that bear on theoretical issues. In particular, I provide
evidence that pronominal clitics and affixes are arguments in Kadiwéu and that nominal phrases are optionally
adjoined to the sentence. Here I will briefly explain the significance of my results.
Kadiweéu has the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted.
nominal phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb, and some discontinuous nominal
expressions are allowed. Jelinek 1984 explains the properties of nonconfigurational languages by proposing that
languages set the elements which can work as verbal arguments. According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and
affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages: nominal phrases are adjuncts. and therefore they can
assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted, however. For instance, Baker
(1994) argues that nominal phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that pronominals are arguments in this
language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb.
Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinck's hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some
languages. First, pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly like English prepositions
in that they assign semantic roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive'. -g ‘goal’. -lokom
‘adessive', and -k ‘allative'. Nounsnever co-occur with such semanticrole assigners. Thefact that boundpronominals, rather than nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal
argument language of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests. for
instance passivization --- which affects pronominals but not nominal phrases -~ support the hypothesis.
This work has implications for studies of language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994
prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals.
rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. Kadiwéu roots resemble nouns of betterknown languages in that they are not transitive; that is, they cannot assign theta-roles to complements. Thomason
at al. 1994 argue that transitivity and valency must be distinguished. The facts of Kadiwéu support this proposal.
Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no transitive roots. Transitivity is introduced via morphemes
function as light verbs (Grimshaw & Mester 1988).",[14]
"The construction of foot templates is established over certain domains which are language-specific. The segment
which follows outside the foot template is called extrametrical. Although extrametrical material is determined in a
language specific-way, only material at the edges of a word can be extramcetrical.",[40]
"Spontaneous speech illustrating free constituent order is not easy to find in Kadiwéu because nominal phrases are
usually absent in this language. Any inflected verb in Kadiwéu corresponds to a complete sentence in English:(151)jib:a:taGawa.

"Prosodic features have frequently been seen to be especially stable, but when languages remain in contact for
several centuries and a shift process toward the dominant language is slow, the opposite pattern has been attestedY It took us incredible work to understand our female interpreter, whowas alittle less barbarian than manyof the otherinfidels. One of the major difficulties was to convince the interpreter to say the words spoken by the men, which are different
from the ones spoken by the women. Since our interpreter was a woman, she gave us the words proper to her gender. Later we
used those words to talk to the men and they ironically asked us whether we were women: and then they corrected the voice
and told us the words proper to their gender.",[24]
