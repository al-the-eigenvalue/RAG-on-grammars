238I shall now deal with a number of words that have no rnorpho'logical
valence and which cannot yet be classified into a definite word-class
because the material is insufficient for this purpose. That I have,
nevertheless, divided them into negations and postpositions is due to
the fact that the negations, at least, have a feature common to them,
one which is not found in the postpositions : only specific forms of the
verb can occur before negations. The feature characteristic of the
postpositions is that they always occur at or within the end of a
word-group.43
The syntactical valence of the negations and postpositions, like that
of the interrogatives, is still not fully known to me. In so far as I have
been able to determine it with certainty will it be mentioned, and
examples will be given.
In additioln, cases will also be given of the occurrence of negations and
postpositions in sentences of which the syntactical structure has not
yet been determined.
The negations and postpositions will be dealt with in the following
order :11. The postpositions: on the basis of their function, these can be
divided into :
1. emphasizing words : arhÂ¥wnat, man
2. conjunctions : am, win, enerim/edm,
44
3. question markers : en/an, open/pen, am1
4. the dubitative marker : ew
5. the irrealis marker : a j
The only exception to this is en$rIwl/e~/ti~
which is always placed between
proper names.
44 There are still three other conjunctions : rn~.vi~zcrimfwiasnerim/maserittz/
mi.sZrtnz/masnim then; w&
again; mariw,/mar&w/Â¥~nart/ntar
- at last,
finally. These link word-groups with word-groups. These words will not be
discussed here because this is not possible without a previous investigation
into the syntax.","[175, 176]"
"43WORD-CLASSES6. the subjectivity marker: uw
7. the quotative marker : in/w/n.
Lastly, I will discuss three elements of which the function is still not
clear to me: m/un/un/d, am3, and aw.
NegationsOnly the following forms of the verb can precede negations :
1. the m-/mV- and the m-/mV-@ forms :
2. the tense and tense-aspect categories of verbs of which the core
contains the formative por == to wish, to try to. These verbal forms
only occur in combination with @k/pak, opO~s.l/powand @nakdw/
pZnakhw. These negations then express a contrariness which can be
translated by : but no, but in vain.opdk/paknot, withoutufidk and pak alternate freely, except after verbs with the formative
for, where opik always occurs. pak was usually found after the m-/mVand the m-/wtV-dji forms of the verb; in other cases op6k was usually
found.opdk/pak can form groups with :
the m-fmV- forms of the verb: m@or pdk embf
see not /didI did not see it;I/substantives :

adjectives :

personal possessive pronouns : or pdk not you

mt much, many : opdk wut by no means
flak not:
opdk fiak really ! positively !
not notCases in which opdk is preceded by the verbal forms mentioned in
239, 2. are:166THE ASMAT LANGUAGESerkw matowoj un arewfdjporamdr ophk iba

""manic"" ajipor opdk eat it, he said, but in vain.
/eat it / he said/ notopow/pownot, withoutThe distribution of o
m and pow is parallel to that of opdk and pak.
I could not find a distinct difference in meaning between o$hk/pak and
o p h / p o w . I got the impression from the examples to hand that the
relationship between opdk/pak and opow/pow is parallel to that
between the non-mood and the mood forms of the verb. opow/pow
was only found in direct speech, in sentences in which the speaker
gives expression to varying moods.
op6w/pow was found linked to :
the m-/mV- forms of the verb:

(Here the speaker deduces a fact and remarks upon it testily to
himself .)

spent part of his childhood there.
My relationship to the two boys developed from the outset on the
'anak piara' 12 pattern: they called me their 'father' and were regarded
as my 'children'. They were paid in cash for their assistance. They
were given a meal every day, and now and then some clothes and
tobacco. With their wages they could buy clothes, tobacco, and the
highly prized axes and chopping knives at the shop in Agats. The
relationship with these informants was a very good and personal one
throughout the whole undertaking. They worked with enthusiasm and
pleasure, apart from some unavoidable lapses.
Because the boys were still rather young, their knowledge of their
mother tongue, of tradition and of mythology was sometimes inadequate
for the translating of the folk tales I collected. The help of an older
man was then enlisted for the interpretation of mythological matters
and special usage. In addition, all the Asinat people with whom I conversed acted as informants. The information received from them was
always checked again with the regular informants.
The reason I chose two of the latter was primarily to enable me to
control the information given by the one by that provided by the other
and vice versa. Another reason was that the boys' capacity for work
was rather small, especially in the beginning - an hour at a stretch
was more than enough for them. Later, when they had been properly
trained, they could sustain a session of two hours or longer without
difficulty. No fixed scheme of questioning was followed at these
sessions. The discussion began on a particular subject and developed
as it went along, depending upon the mood of the informant. The boys
were never prevented from giving information spontaneously, even if
it were not relevant, but sometimes they had to be guided along a fresh
track back to the original subiect. If it became apparent that an answer
to a question about a particular matter was not forthcoming readily,
either because the boy did not understand me, or because he had had
enough, then it was put on one side. Later, a casual return to it often
produced good results. If one of them gave information on a subject
and it differed from that which the other had furnished, then these
variations were discussed in the presence of both of them. And sometimes it then became clear that they held differing opinions regarding
the pronunciation of particular wolrds, or their meaning.
12 The Indonesian word for foster-child,THE ASMAT LANGUAGE7 Tape recordingA portable tape recorder was used extensively for the collecting
of the language data and the music. Thus texts and music could always
be got without difficulty. Only once was I requested not to record
a sacred song. The Asmat people were delighted to hear their own
music reproduced. Western music meant nothing to them. They were
not much interested in the texts, though this did not alter the fact that
the audience always listened critically and expressed their disapproval
in a very positive fashion of any deviations from the version they knew.
The analysis of the texts collected appeared to be of great value for
an understanding of the language and it was through these that I came
upon the track of the special forms of the Asmat verb which express
varying moods.
The language of the folk tales would not appear to differ from
common usage. Asmat songs, however, have their own vocabulary
which is known only to the older people, particularly the singers.
These latter were, however, less inclined to be con~municativeabout
it to strangers.
8 Research in Ag-ats and JepemI began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Government and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight asINTRODUCTION9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"
"Categorial meaning
134The forms of the optative category express an unrealizable wish of
the speaker :j6 cowdk a t-am@-cares h!
river one there /had they but lived together/ pphad they but lived together on one river (8 329) !
In addition, these forms occur in sentences having the irrealis mark a j
(see $ 256). They then relate to' the present or to the future and occur
instead of the forms of categories 12 and 14.norap d j nut a j&v t-bmses-ardj

6 a-towof aj,t-on-cdnpig killed pp flesh /I would give you/If I had killed a pig, I would give you the flesh.
When, however, the verb following after aj relates to the past, then
the past tense forms of categories 16 and 17 occur:92THE ASMAT LANGUAGEt o d es dj, e d - f a w - o f

had they been on the sea, then they would by now have met their
deaths in the water.
12 The habitual category13s
This category, like categories 13 to 15, inclusive, and 18 to 21, inclusive,
is a tense-aspect category with separate characteristics of form for
indicating time and aspect. In this category, as in the two previous
categories, a series of formal and a series of informal forms occur.
These two series are, in addition, opposed to a third series of forms
which express a particular mood of the speaker, such as, for example :
joy, excitement, vexation, disappointment. These forms I shall call
mood forms. The formal and the informal forms are, in this respect,
neutral. I n addition, a few interrogative forms were noted. These occur
only in the traditional stories. I get the impression that they have an
archaic character. Outside the traditional tales, I found in questions only
the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.17
136

181Provisionally, the following can be said about the syntactical valence

proper names, personal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns;

form word-groups with negations.","[136, 137]"

ucim:THE ASMAT LANGUAGEonly once in a text a formwas found instead of ucim.ucinak/uci/uc: uchak is probably a compound formed with uci and
nak true, actual; ucinak occurs in all cases except those given below.
uci was found only once in a context in which one would expect u c h k :
this case is given in. Â 233 under ucinak.
w occurs before the directional pronouns a/ar and adw.
I n addition, u c i and uc occur in the two alternating forms wid and 2 x 2 ,
which occur in contexts in which the speaker expresses annoyance or
uneasiness. These forms have the final 2, dealt with in $ 33.
The syntactical valence of the interrogatives is still not fully known
to me. The structure of the sentences in which they occur is not always
clear. I t can only be said with certainty that they can form groups
with substantives and verbs.
I shall deal first with those cases in which the interrogatives occur
in combination with a m ; then I shall discuss those in which they occur
without am.
Interrogatives occurring i n combination with am:

INTRODUCTION
Recording and presentationThe ten stories presented here are only a selection of tho'se recorded
on tapes. Eight of the sttories were narrated by youths of 14 to 17 years
of age and the recording's were made either at my house in Agats or
in my house in Jepkm. One story, (VI), was tolid by a woman and was
recorded in her own house and one, (X), narrated by an older man,
was recorded in the ceremonial house.
During the narration, the speaker sat cross-legged on the ground on
a sleeping mat, according to Asmat custom. And, since the stories
were being told to an audience, the hand microphone, on its holder,
was placed on the ground in front of the narrator. A number of
listeners were always present during the recording sessions. The
speaker was only interrupted during the telling of the story when a
new tape had to be put on.
The recorded stories were later transcribed and translated with the
help of my informants. For the transcripts, they repeated the stories
word by word, and the translating of each story was only done when
the transcription had been completed.
The stories have been presented - as far as it has been practicable
to do sol - as they were told by the narrators : recapitulations, anacolutha, corrections made by the speakers, sudden changes of theme, and
asides have been retained. Any errors of speech which, in my opinion,
were a hindrance to1 the understanding' of the texts have been deleted.
The transcripts given here are based on the word-by-word repetition
of the stories by my informants, who' sometimes deviated from the
original by using another word-variant, or another word, or by using
an Asmat word instead of a Malay word used by the narrator. In these
cases the word used by the latter is given in a note.
To facilitate the reading of the texts these have been divided into
relatively short paragraphs. One paragraph of the Asmat text corres'ponds to one paragraph of the translation. If any notes occur in aTEXTS181paragraph, these have been put at the end of it. For technical reasons
the notes to the Asmat text as well as the notes to the translation have
been added to the Asmat text.
The spelling of the texts is phonematic ; the special phonological sounds
are written as shown in $ 32, note. The accent is always indicated.
The x indicates the sound made by striking the cupped hand with
the fist. The narrators sometimes did this when the passage dealt with
chopping, striking, spearing, or when they wanted to indicate a thud
o r a crack, o r a sudden start of an action. Since the striking of the
cupped hand with 'the fist often whollly o r partly took the place of a
verbal description, i,t seemed advisable to indicate this sound in the
transcription. A sentence such as : Taweric amds . . . 'Taweric sago' . .
cannot be understood unless the accompanying sounds made by the
narrator are represented: Taweric amds x A- x x 'Taweric chopped
down sago palms'.
In addition, the following punctuation-marks will be used :
the comma, to indicate a nail-final pause in the speech of the narrator;
the full stop, to' indicate a final pause, after a noii-exclamatory sentence ;
the ex~larnatio~n

The anterioritive forms of the ultimate past can occur as the last verb
of a sentence. They then have a conditional meaning. I do not know
in how far their meailing is then identical to that of the forms of
category 10 with the prefix ca- ($ 130) and whether they are interchangeable with those forms :

168I n the course of working on the material it became clear that the verbs
with the suffix -it/ut form a separate category. It was, therefore, not
possible to obtain a complete paradigm from my informants. It is,
however, possible, on. the basis of the cases noted, to deduce the
complete paradigm with rather great certainty. The forms not found
in the material are put between brackets in the paradigm that follows.
All these forms appear to have a semantic element of completion.",[127]

255With some exceptions which will be mentioned later, ew always occurs
in combination with either the interrogative form of the verb, with an
interrogative, or with one of the question markers en/an and @n/pen.

they referred to the action or the happening as such ; for example, when
I asked them ""What's 'to goy"", they replied ""ma-jdr"". ""What's 'to
take' ?"" - ""mi-tew6r"".
The question is, how do these forms stand as regards the core which
can also indicate an action or a happening as such? It is out of the
question that this is an idiosyncracy of my informants, for Drabbe 9
had the same experience with his informants from Ajam.10 It occurs
to me that these forms only differ from the affixless core in having
a semantic element of explanation, or clarification. This idea is supported by the fact that in categories 12, 14, 16 and 17, forms also
occur that are characterized by a prefix m-/mV- which seems to differ
loan-word from Malay.

be formed with the suffix -iriw, which serves to emphas'ize the semantic
value of -nakdp :
j i k c slack ; jinitnakbp very slack ; jinitnakdpiriw very, very slack.
The only case of a secondary derivative with -ere that I came across
was pacdkasd ($ 202).
202Pacdk bad, unfit, has irregular derivatives: the suffix -up and -as
are added to pacdk instead of -nakdp and -nakds:These derivatives express intensity of feeling. Phcakdp is used to
express compassion, for example :

"+WORD-CLASSESThe morphological structure of the coreOnly provisional observations can be made here about the structure
of the core. The reason for this is that the main point of research, as
regards the verb, was an investigation into the verbal categories. An
insight into the structure of the verbal system proved to' be a prerequisite if I were to understand and to speak the Asmat language.
The relative independence of the core made it possible, temporarily
to leave its structure outside consideration. Since, however, research
into the verbal categories took most of the available time, there was
none left for a systematic examination of the cores. This remains one
of the most important tasks for future research.
Consequently, the paragraphs on co-re-structure, as well as the paragraphs on core-morphology, represent only a preliminary reconnaissance
in the field. The picture of the core-structure given here is for the
main part based on indirect information, i.e. information obtained from
an analysis of a specific corpus of verbal cores of which only a small
part was elicited from the informants with this analysis in view. This
corpus of verbal cores consists of 2 3,000 cores, of which Â±1.200
occur in the texts to be appended to this grammatical description.","[54, 55]"

"I t was only in the recent past that the Asrnat region was brought
tinder control - the area was notorious for head-hunting-. Only in 1954
did the Government finally s'et up its seat there, at Agats, though the
Roman Catholic Mission had opened its first Mission station there
in, 1953. It was also at Agats that the Protestant Mission (The
Evangelical Alliance Mission, TEAM for short) began its activities
in this region in 1955.6
I t is my opinion that, from the diachronical point of view, the word bsmat,
or h o t , is possibly a compound formed with the word for 'tree', now os,
and a generic element, now amof, m o t , which is found in compounds like
ser-amot - ser fish (species of), and probably also in the word setmot, set
bird (species of), the name of one of the ceremonial houses (Jew) of Surh.
The name Asmat would then be consistent with a tradition that the people
sprang from trees,
I have to thank D. E. Eyde for this information which he came upon by
chance. It is noteworthy, that a concept of the world common to all the
Asmat people, which is not sacred and is spoken of openly, has for so long
escaped the attention of European investigators.

the Asrnat people, as in so many regions in New Guinea, was first
undertaken by the Roman Catholic and Protestant Missions. The
Dutch Missionary, P. Drabbe, who lived in Agats from 1957 to 1959,
made a study of the dialect of the village of Ajam, 20 miles further
upstream. I n addition, he collected material on various other dialects.
His grammar of the Ajkm dialect, with a vocabulary, as well as a
comparative study of three Asmat dialects, have been published.7
The TEAM linguist, C. Rolesler, is still working on the A j b dialect,
and Mrs. Dresser, the wife of the TEAM doctor at Pirimaphn, Cook
Bay is making an initial study of the Asmat of the Casuarinen Coast.
To date, their work has not been published.
4 Present research, choice of dialectThe following description of the language is the result of an investigation into the coastal dialect around Flamingo Bay which was
carried out from November, 1960, to September, 1962, under the
auspices of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea
(W.O.N.G.).s
The aim of this research was the collecting of material for a description of one of the Asmat dialects. Outside Mission circles in New
Guinea, almost nothing was known about Asmat. Drabbe's grammar
of the Ajkm dialect had been published, though this fact was not
known to me until I arrived in the area, and found that the Mission
disposed over a few copies of it. The only thing on Asmat I had had
at my disposal was a short vocabulary at the end of Drabbe's KAmoro
grammar. Thus a preliminary orientation into the language was not
possible. The investigation had to be started from scratch,

"THE ASMAT LANGUAGEto Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.
8 The terrain, the people, the concept of their worldThe area in which the Kiimoro, Skmpan and Asrnat languages are
spoken consists mainly of a marshy, low-lying, thickly wooded plain,
intersected by countless rivers and streams of which a noteworthy
feature is the ebb and flow of the tide far into the hinterland. The
climate of the region is very humid and the rainfall abundant approximately 225 inches a year. The terrain is very heavy going on
foot, so the canoe is the usual means of transport. I t is used extensively.
One can go everywhere along the natural network of waterways by
canoe and people can thus move about easily and can cover great
distances.
The Asmat people dwell in villages situated along the rivers. The

less than 100. The total Asmat population is estimated to be 40,000
persons. The people of the central Asmat region call themselves &mat
ow.which probably means 'tree peoplej.4
According to the Asrnat people, the territory they inhabit, the b a t
capmmi, is enclosed within, and lies at the bottom of, a gigantic
coconut: their world is not convex but concave.5 The boundaries of
their world correspond roughly to those of their language-area between the Casuarinen Coast and the Mimika Coast (where Kimoro
is spoken). And one can do' the 'journey round the world' by setting
out from the Casuarinen Coast, crossing the stretch of water between
it and the Mimika Coast, landing there, and then returning to the
Casuarinen Coast. Through the middle of this world flows the great
River Sirkc, rising far away, somewhere at the top of the coconut,
close to the holy entrance to the upper world (the outside world).
From this opening, in prehistoric times, the heavenly beings descended
to earth, in order to populate the world with their descendants.

235The interjections form a word-class characterized by :1. the absence of morphological and syntactical valence ;
2. the occurrence of special phonological phenomena ;
3. the breaking of the rules of phoneme distribution;
4. the breaking of the rules of accentuation.
The special phonological phenomena occurring with interj ections are :
word-final k
prolongation of vowels
laryngdization
the special sounds nj, 'm, ts, and pr.
These have already been dealt with in $$ 33-38.
The rules of phoneme distribution arc broken in that the vowel t? can
occur word-finally.
The rules of accentuation are broken in that, in specific cases, the
regular alternation of accented and unaccented vowels does not occur.
The interjections fall into two groups :1. exclamations ;
2. onon~atopoeicinterjections, and exclamations used to call animals
or to urge them on.

237The rules of accentuation are only broken in this group. A phenomenon
frequently occurring in this group is the repetition of the same element,
usually one having one vowel. In this case the alternation of accented
and unaccented vowels does not occur.

term nurum&m - 'you are my husband', my dear one, irrespective of the sex
of the two people concerned and irrespective of whether or not there is a
sexual relationship between them. Instead of noromGm, one can also say nor

"8 The imperative category115In this category there is a division into three object categories, a
division that also occurs in categories 10 to 24, inclusive. These object
categories are :
I.a. the verb has no object ;
b. the object or, where the verb admits of two' objects, the indirect
object, is neither the speaker, nor a group to which the speaker
belongs, nor the person(s) spoken to :

"7. The quotation marker in/un/n
258in/un/n occurs in sentences containing a quotation in direct or in
indirect speech, or containing a statement made from hearsay.
It's noteworthy that the rule of distribution obtaining for in/un is
parallel to that which applies to the verbal forrnatives i t w n / u t h , it/ut
and to a number of verbal suffixes (see $ 91): un occurs after wordfinal m (except after em, to stand), and after word-final p, w or f
preceded by a, o or 26, except after ap to sit. in occurs in the other cases.
n 46 was found only in two texts, narrated by a boy from Jepbni.
(Text VII and IX, 5s 303-306; 316-320). In these texts it occurs
after form 6 of category 19:
Sajan at&tow@mare'nfirst she dropped Safan upstream (5 303).in/un/n always occurs at the absolute end of a word-group.47
With exception of a few interjections, and n2 ($ 2.59). n is distinguished from
all other words by the absence of vowels. In order to indicate that in n a vowel
has been dropped, I shall write 'a. The same applies to n1.
47 For the postpositions en/an, op&/pen, am, ew, aw, and in/un/'n a relative
order could be determined ; this order is :

the [ti] allophone of the e phojneme would occur in ew, whereas the
[ E l allophone occurs.
Therefore I shall write awsd, dwamis, dwusd etc.
The prefixes em-and p-./'pV179There are two prefixes of which the occurrence appears to be exclusively
dependent upon syntactical factors. These prefixes are em- and p-/pV-.
em- occurs only when the verb is linked with the interrogative word
ucim - how, how many. I t does not, however, occur with the verb
em - to make.
em- was found in forms of categories 10, 12, 16, 17 and 24 with the
prefix a-/aj- or zero; it precedes a-/aj-.","[134, 135]"
"WORD-CLASSESExceptions to this rule are :
ap to sit ; &om to cause to sit.
tep to go upstream ; tep.om, tdp.om to cause to go upstream.
82I n three cases suffixation of -Vm occurs simultaneously with infixation
of -Vm:
sit to get up; s.4m.ut.h to cause to get up.
fiw to go inside; fiim.u.m to cause to go inside.
-fis to come inside, to come outside; f.im.us.zim to cause to come
inside, or outside.
These three roots each have an allomorph with 24 instead of i, which
occurs only in this case (see $ 98).
83Two positional roots cannot be combined with -m/Vm:
em can mean 'to stand' as well as 'to cause to be stood up, to put
down' (of a 'standing' object)
amis, to lie, does not occur with the meaning 'to lay, to put down'
(a 'lying' object); in place of it, another root is used: tiw, to lay,
to put down.-t-n/Vm has a particular value 2 in such cases as :
(jaj to burn ; fa.m to cause to burn ; dp to sit, to stay) :
jo fd.m.ap to stay somewhere until the sun begins to shine.

jo p h . e m t o stay somewhere until the sun rises.
(tis to go outside) :
pir jamnbk ji.s.m.ap
moon twoto stay somewhere until two 'months' have elapsed.
In using the term meaning exclusively for the semantic aspect of words, and
the term value for the semantic aspect of parts of words, or morphemes,
I follow E. M, Uhlenbeck and A. Reichling. See: E. M. Uhlenbeck, De
systeniatiek der Javaanse pronornina, VKI 30, Den Haag 1960, Inleiding p. 2;

As with the imperative forms, I did not find here a difference in
meaning between f o m s with and without a prefix, and between the

I l l THE ACCENTIntroduction
39To the most recent investigations in the field of accent belong the
studies of the American linguist D. L. Bolinger. In 1958, the results
of a number of experiments he had made were published.8 These
showed that the most important cue in determining stress in English
is what he terms 'prominence of pitch', i.e. ""a rapid and relatively

"PART IINTRODUCTION1 The Asmat language: area, adjacent languages, dialectsThe language of the Asmat Papuans, Asmat,l is one of a number
of related Papuan languages which are spoken over an extensive area
of the coastal plain of South-West New Guinea (Irian Barat). These
languages extend along the coast from the River Opa in the nolrth-west
to the mouth of the River Digul in the south-east.2
The Asmat region is generally considered to be the coastal strip
and the adjacent hinterland between the Rivers Momkc (Le Cocq
d'Armandville) and Ewtii. In addition to his region, however, Asmat
is also spoken in a small area to the east of the confluence of the Rivers
Sirkc (Eilanden) and Wildeman; on the coastal strip between the
Ewtk and Cook Bay (the Casuarinen Coast) ; and in a few villages
on the coast between Cook Bay and the mouth of the River Digul.
I t is still not known with certainty how far inland the Asmat
language-area extends. I t was only recently that this coastal area was
brought under Government control and that part of the low-lying
plain abutting onto the mountainous country in the centre is still
practically terra incognita. Up to now, Asmat villages have been
encountered inland to a distance of more than 70 miles.
To the north-west of the Asmat language-area, two languages related

8. multiplication: only two cases were noted : one of triplication

II T H E VERBIntroduction
63From the preceding survey of the morphological processes, it is42THE ASMAT LANGUAGEclear that the word-class of the verb is distinguished from the other
word-classes by the fact that all these processes occur within it, whereas
outside the word-class of the verb only suffixation and composition
occur.
Of the morphological processes which occur only within the wordclass of the verb, only prefixation can occur with all verbs, and
therefore, is characteristic of the verb as a whole: an Asmat verb could
be defined as a word which is, or can be, prefixed.
The mo~rphologicalstructure of the verb which is often very complicated, in comparison to the structure of non-verbs, makes it necessary to divide the description of the verb into three parts:1. a general survey of the morphological structure of verbal forms
and of the relation between the core-morphology and the wordmorphology of the verb ;
2. the core-morphology ;3. the word-morphology.
General survey of the structure of verbal formsCore and peripheral part
64Within the verb, two parts can be distinbuished which are to a certain
degree independent of each other, namely :1. a central part, which will be termed the core of the verb ;
2. a peripheral part.
The verbal core can be monomorphematic or polymqhematic. The
peripheral part consists of prefixes and/or suffixes added to the core.
The mutual independence of the core and the peripheral part shows
itself in a difference in internal organization which makes a separate
description of the two parts necessary.
Their mutual dependence shows itself in the fact that: a. a verb
consists either of a core, or of a core
peripheral part, but never of
a peripheral part alone; and b. there are a number of verbal categories
that do not occur with cores ending with the morphemes iturn, es, it
or u w e ~(see 5s 91-94).","[53, 54]"
