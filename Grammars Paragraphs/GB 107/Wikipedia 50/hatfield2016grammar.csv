"3187.8 Negation
Negation is expressed in a number of different ways. The primary negative
morpheme is an invariant word iki.15 Most negative non-imperative clauses contain this
word, though it occasionally co-occurs with a suffix -nak on the verb or a clause-final
negative word mehek. There is a prohibitive word mana that is used in negative
imperative sentences (§7.8.3).
7.8.1 iki 'not' and the negative verbal suffix -nak
The default non-imperative negative clause involves just the negative word iki. It
always precedes the final (finite) verb, though not necessarily immediately before the
verb. It typically precedes material other than a subject that is not a pronoun. Example
(321) illustrates iki preceding the adverbial word anganambu 'fast'.
(321) ikianganambu wi
ambe-ka-num
NEG
fast
go.up finish−FUT2-1PL
We will not [be able to] go up quickly.","[334, 335]"
"2727While nominal objects seem to follow iki more often, there are cases like those in (331)
and (332) where the nominal object precedes iki.
(331) bali
kufe=r
iki yikwa kisi=ka

eat-PRES.1PL NEG6121(332) kom
fenda=t
iki a-num
ELIC
village from=DIM NEG eat−PRES.1PL
The one[s] from the village we do not eat.
The most frequent negative clause employs the word iki and is otherwise like an
affirmative clause. However, in one variation on this, tense suffixes are absent from the
verb, although the subject agreement suffixes are still used. An example is given in
(333), where the verb sukna 'sleep' occurs with a masculine agreement suffix but no
tense suffix.
(333) sofo kur
sul
iki sukna-r
snake snake.species ground NEG sleep-M
The kur snake doesn’t sleep on the ground ...

"6065A second type of clause which generally lacks a mood particle is negative clauses, as
in (60) and (61); see §7.8 for more on negation.
(60) selen=r mu nere=r

Because negative clauses denote something that did not happen, we might expect an
irrealis particle, though except for one circumstance described below, this does not
happen. The absence of an irrealis mood particle applies not only to negated past and
present clauses but also to negated future clauses, as in (62) and (63).

The name of the language comes from the word mehek 'no', as described in §1.1.
This word can be used as a response to a question as the sole answer with the meaning
'no'. But it can also be used to negate a clause, as in (359) and (362). In this use it always
occurs at the end of the clause.
(359) ikire

preceding examples. In this case, it is for emphasis and is always optional. It also occurs
occasionally as the sole indication of negation, as in (361).
(361) o-rni-m-f

"An exception to the generalization that the irrealis particle does not occur in
negative clauses is apodosis clauses in conditional sentences, as shown in (65) to (67).

A third type of clause that frequently lacks a mood particle is clauses in which the
verb bears the conditional suffix (§6.3.2 and §8.4), illustrated in (68) and (69).",[276]
"6.6 Negative -nak
One of the ways of expressing negation is by adding a suffix -nak to the verb, as in
(111) and (112). This suffix cannot have a person/number/gender suffix following it.
(111) on i

"A GRAMMAR OF MEHEK
by
Adam Hatfield
June 1, 2016A dissertation submitted to the
Faculty of the Graduate School of
the University at Buffalo, State University of New York
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
degree of
Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of LinguisticsAcknowledgements
The work in this dissertation was made possible by two grants from the National
Science Foundation (NSF). The first grant was under Matthew Dryer, my major
professor. The second grant was an NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant, BCS1263554,
designed to allow for additional data collection. Below are lists of the main consultants
who provided data, time, generosity and hospitality to me while learning Mehek. The
primary consultants are the ones who provided ongoing and/or daily time for long
periods. The secondary consultants provided large amounts of data over a fixed time
period, either hours or multiple times over several days. In addition to those listed
below, there were well over 50 different people who gave different kinds of language
data. Their time and assistance are graciously appreciated. I would also like to thank the
members of my dissertation committee (listed below), and the faculty, staff and
students of the Linguistics Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

Each glossed example used in this grammar is followed by a four digit number or
the letters “ELIC” or “OVH”. For numbers, the first digit represents which of the seven
notebooks the data are recorded in and the last three digits represent the page or story
number from that notebook. The letters “ELIC” are short for “elicitation” and represent
an example from direct elicitation. The letters “OVH” are short for “overheard” and
represent an example heard in natural speech.
Proper names (including those for people, plants and animals) are glossed in English
with the same word used in Mehek where an English or Tok Pisin equivalent does not
exist.xvAbstract
This is a grammar which provides a detailed linguistic description of the phonology,
morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of the Mehek language
and its speakers. Mehek is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea by approximately
6300 people. It belongs to the Sepik language family, Tama branch. The theoretical
background employed is Basic Linguistic Theory. Mehek shares general features with
many non-Austronesian Papuan languages, including: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; agglutinative verbal morphology; and the
morphology of other word classes is relatively simple.xviChapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview
Mehek (ISO code nux) is a language of the Tama branch of the Sepik family spoken
in Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea. There are approximately 6300 speakers
(Gordon 2005) spread out over an area of roughly 65 square miles. The data for this
study were gathered in three field trips during the summers of 2010, 2012 and 2014.
The total length of the trips was nine months and time was spent in each of the Mehekspeaking villages, though the primary location was the village of Wilwil (see §2.1 below).
There is no prior published grammatical information on Mehek, though some
neighboring languages have had partial Bible translations done or a grammatical sketch
done.
The goal of the present grammar is to provide a detailed linguistic description of the
phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of Mehek
and its speakers. In the present chapter, information on the language and speakers is
given and the following areas will be discussed: linguistic scene and language vitality
(§1.1), genetic classification of Mehek (§1.2), previous research (§1.3), dialects (§1.4),
fieldwork (§1.5) and theoretical background (§1.6). Chapter 2 will discuss topics relevant
to culture and environment. After that, chapter 3 will provide a brief grammatical sketch
of the language and its primary features. Chapters 4-11 will discuss linguistic topics of
the language, specifically: phonology (chapter 4), word classes (chapter 5), nouns and1noun phrases (chapter 6), verbs and verb phrases (chapter 7), clause types (chapter 8),
clausal relations (chapter 9), discourse and paralanguage (chapter 10), and lexical fields
(chapter 11). Following these chapters are several appendices of additional information
and reference. These include sample texts (Appendix A); multi-lingual dictionaries:
Mehek-English-Tok Pisin (Appendix B), English-Mehek (Appendix C), and Tok PisinMehek (Appendix D); lists of animal and plant Species (Appendix E); thematic vocabulary
(Appendix F); personal name index (Appendix G); names, songs and whistles (Appendix
H); place and clan names (Appendix I); and garamut drum beats (Appendix J).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

7.0 Introduction
This chapter discusses the fundamentals of clause structure. It begins with
discussion of subjects and objects (§7.1), and then discusses the mood particles (§7.2),
adjuncts and adverbs (§7.3), serial-verb constructions (§7.4), clauses with nonverbal
predicates (§7.5), passive clauses (§7.6), interrogative sentences (§7.7), negation (§7.8),
clauses with the word erka 'want' (§7.9), light verbs (§7.10), and repetition (§7.11). For
information on additional clause types which only occur in complex sentences, see
Chapter 8. The general structure of clauses is given in (1).
(1) Clause = subject + (mood particle) + (direct object) + (indirect object) + verb
An example sentence illustrating the formula in (1) is given in (2).

terminology. Subjects are those constituents with which the main, finite verb shows
agreement (see §6.1 - §6.4). Objecst are those constituents which are (or could be)
represented by an object pronominal form (see §5.4.2). The terms direct object and
indirect object are used primarily as semantic labels; there are no clear grammatical
differences between the two types of object. I refer to the recipient-like constituents in245a ditransitive clause as indirect objects and I refer to objects that are not indirect objects
as direct objects.","[260, 261, 262]"

an English name, Pidgin name (after the source language, Tok Pisin), or Christian name.
These names are all typical English names which have been incorporated due to
extensive contact with the West over the last 100 years (and perhaps the difficulty of
foreigners in pronouncing native names).
9.7.2 Bad Name sir kaha
The most commonly used form after the given name is the sir kaha which means
'bad name'. The name itself does not have negative connotations, nor is it considered
rude to use the name. The name is considered “bad” because it is used when the
speaker believes that the addressee has behaved badly. Its use reflects the fact that its
owner has violated some social convention. The choice to use the sir kaha is a reflection
of the speaker’s attitude toward the addressee. Typically, however, the speaker will not
be angry with the addressee, but will be using this variant to help enforce some social
norm which the addressee has violated. In some contexts, the sir kaha is similar to
nicknames in the English speaking world and can similarly be used affectionately (akin to
calling friends by names that highlight negative personal qualities). The sir kaha is still392used widely by most speakers and most speakers will know the kaha form of most given
names, whether or not they know someone who has that name (this is not the case with
the other name variants, see §9.7.3 - §9.7.5).
The most common usage of the sir kaha is by parents towards their children. As
children age, the likelihood that they will be addressed by their sir kaha is lessened. The
purpose of the sir kaha, the speakers say, is to “spoil the name” of someone when they
have done something wrong. When the ordinary given name consists of morphemes,
the typical method of forming the sir kaha is to replace one of the morphemes of the
given name with a different morpheme. This has the effect of changing or altogether
removing the meaning of that person’s name. For any given name, there is a unique sir
kaha. Therefore, all people with the same given name will always be addressed by the
same variant form in the sir kaha.
There are a couple of less formal ways to form the sir kaha of a name. One is to
simply shorten the name by replacing the second morpheme of the name with /ks/,
which has the sense of friendly ribbing. Example (46) gives two examples of this.
(46) nanda timba becomes nandeks
'older.brother not.have'solaku becomes solaks
(no meaning)A more affectionate shortening of the name involves dropping final syllable(s) and
stretching out the remaining final vowel. In the case of final /u/, this often transitions to
/i/ as in the second example in (47).","[407, 408, 409]"
"7081In general, adjuncts and adverbs tend to follow the mood particles or the negative
word iki. Examples (149) and (150) both illustrate awar 'later' following the irrealis
particle wa.

Example (152) illustrates a locative phrase wulak 'in the jungle' following the object
noun phrase naku elowom 'sago or meat', though since objects also generally follow the
negative word iki, this example is probably more reflecting an atypical position for the
object noun phrase rather than an atypical position for the locative phrase.

The word timba is a negative word that expresses the meaning 'not have'. It occurs
in a construction with the possessor as subject and thing possessed a noun phrase
before the verb, possibly an object, as in (372) and (373). It behaves like an adjective in
that it occurs with person/number/gender clitics in predicate position, but apparently
does not occur with verb morphology.

Though less common (due to the ease of simply incorporating Tok Pisin words),
Mehek speakers often use Mehek words or expressions for meanings associated with
western culture and hence meanings not expressed in traditional Mehek, especially by
metaphorical extension of Mehek words. There are not many common examples, and
even those listed in Table 59 are often simply replaced with the Tok Pisin equivalent.

an appropriate Mehek equivalent for a Tok Pisin concept to avoid having too many Tok
Pisin words in their speech. This appears to be mainly because they are making a
conscious effort to preserve Mehek language and culture.
9.12.2 Code Switching
In addition to the single lexical items that frequently make their way into speech,
there are many instances where grammatical particles from Mehek make their way into
speech that is primarily Tok Pisin, or where Mehek verbs head phrases which are
otherwise completely Tok Pisin. Most of the time, a given conversation will take place
mostly in Mehek, with occasional Tok Pisin lexical items sprinkled throughout. The
reverse is less common, but does occur, particularly with cultural items or practices
which Tok Pisin does not have a word for or has a cumbersome phrase rather than a
single lexical item. Code switching, by distinction, is when grammatical elements from
one language interact with the other. This mostly happens with verbs and also
sometimes discourse particles, such as klei. In the case of verbs, if the utterance is
primarily Mehek, the Tok Pisin verb will occur at the end of the clause as required by
Mehek grammar, despite the fact that Tok Pisin constituent order is usually SVO.
However, the reverse does not hold. When an utterance is primarily Tok Pisin, the
Mehek verb, which will take the appropriate tense and person agreement for the clause,412still occurs at the end of the clause. In each of the overheard examples below, the Tok
Pisin word and its gloss are in bold, to simplify the distinction between the two
languages. Examples (48) to (53) are overheard utterances with this kind of code
switching.

"368Note that the shared subject can be overt in the infinitival clause, as in (94) above,
where the third person plural pronoun mu occurs in the infinitival clause, even though it
is also subject of the main clause. Note that these infinitival clauses have the internal
structure of clauses, with subjects, objects, or locative phrase, as in the above examples.
A third use of the infinitival form of verbs is in one of the negative constructions in
which the verb na 'be' bears the negative suffix -nak and functions as a type of auxiliary
verb while what is semantically the main verb occurs with the infinitival suffix, as in (97).

"1.1 The Linguistic Scene and Language Vitality
Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse country in the world (Gordon
2005). There are more than 800 languages spoken in the country, and more than 1000
spoken on the island of New Guinea. These languages are still not well documented and
language family groupings are often tenuous and disputed. The primary linguistic
grouping in Papua New Guinea is the “Trans-New Guinea” language family, which
contains almost 500 languages. With more documentation, many smaller family
groupings have been established, though these are often uncertain as well. The Sepik
family to which Mehek belongs is one of these smaller families.
Languages of Papua New Guinea have some broad features in common, many of
which Mehek shares. These shared features include: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; complex, agglutinative verbal morphology2(though Mehek verbal morphology is not overly complex); and the morphology of other
word classes is usually simpler. Beyond these generalizations, it is difficult to otherwise
group all (or even most) languages of Papua New Guinea based on any specific criteria.
The origin of the name of the Mehek language is unknown, though it does follow
the naming pattern of many other languages in the immediate geographical area, up to
the Torricelli Mountain Range. This is a practice of the Lumi District administration
wherein languages are named after their word for 'no'. (Laycock 1968) The name is
sometimes pronounced without the /h/ or instead with a glottal stop [mɛɛk] or [mɛɁɛk].
In careful speech, it is sometimes pronounced with both, [mɛhɛɁɛk]. The people, for the
most part, adhere to this practice and call their own language Mehek or Mehek Suma
'Mehek Language'. According to Ethnologue (Gordon 2005), it is also known as
Indinogosima, Driafleisuma and Nuku. The former two names have been attested from
some speakers. Suma is a word meaning 'voice' and the words indi numgo are a
demonstrative and possessive pronoun meaning 'our'. The term driaflei is an erroneous
rendition of dinafle, 'one'. Naming the language Nuku, after the most prominent village
where it is spoken, is another common naming practice in the area, though typical of
languages that are only spoken in one village (Laycock 1968). This is an exonym rather
than a term the speakers use for their own language.
The language is currently still used on a daily basis by most of the adult speakers.
Their attitudes towards the language are good, though it is only irregularly transmitted3to children. Despite this, most children primarily have a passive understanding of the
language and do not actively use it except in limited form with adults. Amongst each
other, children (roughly, those under the age of about 20), speak Tok Pisin almost
exclusively. See §2.4.3 for more information on intergenerational transmission.
Tok Pisin is a creole language spoken by most people within Papua New Guinea. Its
lexifier language is primarily English, though many core vocabulary items come from
nearby Melanesian languages (primarily Malay and Tolai) as well as German. Tok Pisin is
spoken by all but the most elderly and English is spoken only by those who have had
schooling beyond the sixth grade. Children (ages approximately <14) do not have as
great a command of Mehek as do adults, particularly in the lexical domain. They do not
speak it as often or as readily as adults, though they do understand it and can respond
to basic utterances. The use of Tok Pisin in the schools is likely the reason that children
use Tok Pisin in more situations than adults. Because children seem to be using Tok Pisin
more than Mehek, the youngest generation will likely speak Tok Pisin to their children
even more than their parents currently do. This may lead to the decline in the vitality of
Mehek in the coming generations. See §9.12 for more information on the influence of
Tok Pisin on Mehek.","[18, 19, 20]"

dependency status of the second clause to the first. (This is real-world, rather than
grammatical dependency.) The first type listed, conjunction, merely requires the
juxtaposition of the two clauses and no further ordering or dependency is implied
(though these may both be implied by context). Going down the list, the different clause
types impose restrictions, first on the temporal relationship, then on the dependency
status of the second clause. The final type listed, conditional, requires not only a
temporal sequence and a dependency relationship, but the further requirement that the
first clause itself may not actually occur.
The syntax for the clausal particles yombo 'simultaneous', yungu 'dependent', and
rokor 'causal' relationships is similar. Unlike the verbal aspectual particles (§7.2), these
particles are not affixes, but are instead separate words with their own stress and (in
some cases), capable of taking their own agreement markers. As for the syntax of the
clauses themselves, in the default, unmarked context, they each require the verb
immediately preceding to have no inflection and to end in the gerundial suffix –m (see
§8.3.3). It is also possible for the preceding verb to have no inflection when imperative,
as well as the conditional marker if the speaker wishes to emphasize that the action has
not yet happened. The syntax of the two clauses linked by a particle is the same in the
case of all three. These cases are summarized in Table 48 below. The abbreviations used
include V for verb and INFL for full verbal inflection.","[357, 358]"

Because this suffix deals with situations which have not been or will not be realized,
no tense suffix can accompany it. The appropriate time period is only inferred from
context. When the desiderative is used, either in the assertive or in the negative, it
implies that the action under consideration was not, or will not be done. But it is not
necessarily future. In (51), for example, the meaning is not 'I want to see it' but 'I wish I
had seen it' or 'I wish I could have seen it'. In other words, the desiderative can express
a wish that something happened but didn’t happen.

"1.5 Fieldwork
The lack of a recent grammatical description on a Tama language motivated the
selection of Mehek as a field site. The particular villages chosen were due to the
availability of family homes to stay in for an extended period. The initial contact with
Mehek speakers occurred in the village of Sibilanga, a village several miles north in the
Torricelli Mountains. This village has an airstrip and available accommodations for
visitors. Two Mehek speakers reside in Sibilanga and agreed to be language consultants.
After doing preliminary work with them, it was agreed for me to spend time with each
of them and their families in their home villages. This enabled me to collect additional
data from the active speech community as well as gain a more thorough understanding
of their ways of life. The data in this grammar are based on the following material:
Elicited material – These were primarily vocabulary and simple sentence
elicitations. The bulk of the elicited sentences were done early on in Sibilanga, after
which more complex data was gathered. Vocabulary elicitations, other than initial word
lists, were primarily done in the domains of plants, animals, and names (both personal
and place names). Elicitation was also used to get complete paradigms or to fill in
assumed gaps in some domains (personal names being a particularly notable one).",[24]
"4093The third negative construction also involves the suffix -nak, but instead of
appearing directly on the verb, it appears on the verb na 'be at', which functions as a
kind of auxiliary verb that immediately follows the main verb, which appears in
infinitival form, as in (341) to (345).

There are several gestures which are commonly used among Mehek speakers and
which were observed to be consistent from speaker to speaker and from context to
context. A fuller study of gesture is needed to determine the full range and usage of

observed.

when laughingTable 50: Mehek Gestures9.7 Personal Names
The system of personal names in Mehek presents a unique system where each
person has, in addition to their given name, additional names uniquely tied to the given
name which serve as affective markers of the speaker’s attitude toward the addressee,
be it happy or upset. These are the so-called “good name” and “bad name”. Not only
does every person have these names, but the culture provides people with names in389two further modalities: song and whistle. Just as the spoken names indicate the attitude
of the speaker, so does the song. However, the purpose of the whistle is long-distance
or out-of-sight communication; it is possible to communicate with someone over great
distances simply by whistling their unique name. The addressee has a limited repertory
of possible responses, as the whistles are mainly a component of the naming system
and not a wider method of communication. A full listing of personal names is given in
Appendix G. Appendices H and I contain additional information about names.
9.7.1 Given Name sir
The given name, or sir, is assigned at birth and the choice ultimately rests with the
mother. There is a set of given names from which to choose when a child is born,
though it is possible to create a new name for one's child. None of the names is
associated with a particular gender. Some of them do have tendencies toward one
gender or the other, though this is not a strong tendency, but only a “feeling” on the
parts of some speakers. (This is similar to unisex names in English that have gender
biases, such as Tony or Kelly.) This means that a female child can be (and often is)
named after the mam (the maternal uncle).
An important concept in the kin system is that of the yowul. A yowul is both a kin
term for the children of a male’s younger siblings (see §10.1), as well as 'namesake'.
Because the mam will at least advise (if not direct) his younger sisters on how to name
her children, a mam will also often become a yowul 'namesake' of one of his nieces or390nephews. This type of naming is an honor, and the mam will often only be the namesake
of one person in the family. Additionally, the mam is responsible throughout his life to
look after and support his sisters’ children and their families, whether or not they are his
namesake. This includes helping out with construction, gardening, or financial assistance
for school fees. The mam’s role continues even after his nieces and nephews marry,
though in a reduced capacity.
Because of the tendency of most people to have a yowul within the family, a certain
subset of the total inventory of names tends to stay within families, but there is no
social requirement to do this. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on who can take a
particular name. Names are not secret or private, nor is there any reluctance for a
person to share his name with an outsider on first meeting them.
Names are always polysyllabic and typically bimorphemic. A majority of the names
are composed of two morphemes that have independent status and a (relatively)
transparent meaning. There are also some names where only part of the name contains
an independent morpheme or where the whole name has no identifiable morphemes or
meaning. There is no sense in which a name describes a child’s characteristics or
prescribes a destiny. Some names have negative connotations, but those connotations
do not reflect poorly on the child. The examples in (45) are a sample of personal names,
but for a full listing, see Appendix G.","[405, 406, 407]"

That is, these are the names that speakers will repeat in the tone of the call that the
animal makes. There are likely other names which have onomatopoeic components
which are no longer consciously known to speakers (particularly reduplicative names
that consist of words that are otherwise not found as independent morphemes). The
only non-name words that are known to have an onomatopoeic element are yo 'a sound
made while calling another' and kra 'cry'.
Sound symbolism is also not a productive system, though there a few words where
one of the vowels can vary in relationship to the size of the object being described. In
these cases, the smaller size is associated with a high vowel and the larger size is
77associated with a (relatively) lower vowel. The known examples are given in examples

4.0 Introduction
The purpose of this short chapter is to provide a general overview of some aspects
of the grammatical system of Mehek. In §4.1, I summarize the morphology, primarily
the morphology of verbs, while in §4.2, I discuss one of the more unusual features of
Mehek, a set of noun phrase clitics that code the number and gender of noun phrases,
plus a similar set of predicate clitics which appear on nonverbal predicates.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"
"8Descriptions – Once the domains of plants and animals seemed to be fully covered,
verbal descriptions of each plant and animal were recorded. These recordings included
descriptions of physical characteristics, locations where they could be found, and uses
employed by the community.
Stories and myths – These include traditional tales, histories of clans and individual
people, family histories, explanations about why the world is the way it is, and
explanations of processes, such as scraping sago and house construction.
Written material – Very little native-produced written material was gathered,
though some speakers did write short stories or letters for me. The knowledge of
writing in Tok Pisin was applied to Mehek and was often very similar to the orthography
that I had developed. In addition, some basic educational materials had been created by
local primary school teachers and these were shared with me.
Natural speech – by this is meant speech which was spoken in my presence or
overheard. These often provided excellent insights into the way the language is actually
used and also provided examples of things never encountered in any of the above
settings. There were at least a dozen instances of natural speech (often a single word or
phrase) that provided the impetus for further documentation. In nearly every case,
follow-up yielded fruitful results.
All of the collected data were either written directly in a notebook from the elicited
speech or audio-recorded. The recordings were made with a Tascam DR-07 Portable9Digital Recorder. Several brief videos were also recorded. In every case, each recording
was later transcribed by me with the help of a consultant (the one who originally made
the recording when possible). All of these data were typed and entered into a database
of materials. The database contains approximately 105,000 words or 225 pages of
single-spaced text. This includes the notebooks and other notes I wroted in the field.
The total of distinct entries in the dictionary is just over 3200 words. All consultants gave
their permission for their speech to be used in whatever manner is appropriate for the
preservation of the Mehek language. It is my ultimate goal to present a basic grammar,
full dictionary, collection of stories, and, possibly, basic educational materials to the
Mehek speakers as a gift for their generosity in spending time assisting in this work.","[24, 25, 26]"

Table 38: Subject SuffixesSubject suffixes attach directly to the verb stem in negative constructions (see
§7.8). Typically, however, person marking follows tense/mood (and if present, aspect)
marking. There is one irregularity in the subject suffixes, and this occurs in the first
person singular. Namely, there are two different morphemes that indicate first-person
singular: −yun, and −n. These involve a tense distinction and will be discussed more fully
below in §6.1.1. In addition, a confounding factor in this paradigm is the 2SG suffix −n,
which is identical with one of the 1SG suffixes. However, these two subject suffixes can
be distinguished in that the first person singular suffix -n does not occur with tense
suffixes. The first person subject suffix -n is illustrated in (2) while the second person
subject suffix -n is illustrated in (3).

"9.12 Tok Pisin
Due to the widespread use of Tok Pisin as a medium of communication (see §1.1),
most people freely mix Tok Pisin words into their Mehek speech. In fact, they are often
unaware that they have done so if it is pointed out. One salient example of this
unawareness of the intrusion of Tok Pisin words is the word kawil. This was given as the
name for a cross-section of a particular type of bamboo that is hollow but has spoke-like
supports which children often play with. It follows the sound patterns of Mehek and
could very easily be a native Mehek word. At a later point, however, it became clear404that it was not a Mehek word, but rather the Tok Pisin ka wil 'car wheel'. Upon extensive
questioning, speakers did acknowledge that it was Tok Pisin, though they had at first
insisted that it was indeed a Mehek word.
Children under the age of 18 or so are particularly apt to not only incorporate Tok
Pisin extensively, but to speak it almost exclusively. Most people in this age group
understand Mehek to varying degrees of proficiency, but for the most part do not speak
Mehek actively. There are exceptions to this generalization of course, but most young
people are most comfortable with Tok Pisin. This is the language of all school instruction
above the primary level (about third grade) and the language used to communicate with
all people who are not from the Mehek-speaking villages. There is frequent contact with
the Eho-speaking villagers just south of Wilwil (the southernmost non-Kafle village).
Also, women who marry into the Mehek-speaking community from outside villages
initially communicate in Tok Pisin, but typically learn Mehek to some extent. However,
due to the widespread use of Tok Pisin, it is increasingly uncommon for women who
marry in to learn to speak Mehek with any degree of proficiency. Some topics are nearly
always discussed in Tok Pisin. These include politics and religion in particular, though
many topics are discussed in Tok Pisin intermittently. Topics dealing with traditional
village life are mostly discussed in Mehek, including planting, hunting, village gossip, and
family matters. Tok Pisin words and phrases frequently enter Mehek conversations and
most speakers, when asked about this, think it is a bad thing. However, every speaker
does use at least some Tok Pisin words in their speech. When children are present, a
405primarily Mehek conversation will proceed, but when the children are addressed
directly or when their understanding is particularly desired, they will be addressed (and
respond) in Tok Pisin. In these cases, people initially make a statement in Mehek and
then repeat it in Tok Pisin. If these trends continue, it is likely that Mehek will cease to
be the primary means of communication within two generations. Below are some of the
main ways that Tok Pisin interacts with Mehek in daily conversation.
9.12.1 Borrowings and Translations
There are two broad categories of Tok Pisin borrowings: those that are for words or
concepts that pertain to Western goods and culture and therefore do not have a Mehek
equivalent; and those which do have a Mehek equivalent, but are very commonly used
in Tok Pisin and are either more succinct than the Mehek equivalent, or are perceived as
preferable for some reason. Especially with the latter group of words, speakers will be
more aware that these words come from Tok Pisin and will sometimes express
embarrassment about using them while speaking Mehek. As for the first group, there
are some words for Western goods and culture which have been created, calqued, or
borrowed into Mehek and which are perceived as Mehek words. Table 54 gives a list of
the most common Tok Pisin borrowings for which there is no Mehek equivalent. Of note
is the word for 'clan'. The Mehek kinship system does involve a clan structure (see
§2.3.3), but there does not seem to be a word meaning 'clan'. The word sambo is406sometimes used, but it refers to the garamut beat (see §9.10) pertaining to a person or
clan.

On the other hand, many Tok Pisin nouns are adopted despite the fact that there
are already Mehek words for those concepts. One reason for this is that Mehek makes
many finer distinctions in meaning where the Tok Pisin has a more general word. As an
example, the Tok Pisin word kari (from English 'carry') means more or less the same as
its English equivalent. However, in Mehek it is not possible to refer to carrying without
specifying the type and manner of carrying from ten different verbs. A different
situation arises in the case of the numerals. Tok Pisin numerals come from English and
are phonetically quite similar to the English. Mehek, however has a restricted counting
system with poly-syllabic numerals. Many speakers have difficulty even remembering
the numerals above five. In the past, this was not an issue, as counting was not an
important skill. But with the intrusion of Western culture and money, it is often407necessary to refer to specific and large numbers. The Mehek system allows for counting
up to approximately 24, but is not easy or practical to use. In practice, numbers above
ten are not useful at all.
Tok Pisin is so widely used even by proficient Mehek speakers that it is often simply
easier to choose a word from Tok Pisin despite the Mehek equivalent being equally
prominent. Table 55 lists the most commonly used Tok Pisin exemplars of this type.

"5048Most present and past utterances will be marked with the realis particle, while
most future and some past utterances will be marked with the irrealis particle. Despite
this generalization, it is possible to have any combination of tense/mood and
realis/irrealis. Examples illustrating the possibility of combining the realis mood particle
with a verb inflected as future and the possibility of combining the irrealis mood particle
with a verb inflected as past are given below in (26) and (41).
Single-word clauses or short clauses without any subject suffixes will have the realis
particle following the verb and phonologically part of the verb, hence the reason that it250is represented as a clitic. When ka follows the verb, it does not receive main stress and
is pronounced as part of the verb it follows; hence I represent it as a clitic, as in (21).

I refer to the forms with the suffix -tn as first person singular imperatives, even
though the semantics of these forms is rather different from the semantics of first
person singular imperative pronouns (and what have been labeled first person singular
imperatives in other languages). I do so partly because the suffix -tn is in paradigmatic
opposition to the suffix -ta, both suffixes occur on verbs without any other suffix, and
because both begin with a /t/. In addition, although different from the first person
singular imperative pronoun, the use of the suffix -tn does place the speaker under an
obligation to perform the action in question, just as some uses of second-person
imperatives place the hearer under an obligation to perform the action in question.
Examples illustrating the tn-imperative are given in (109) and (110).

something immediately. That is, it is not infelicitous for a person to use this form and235then to fail to immediately do the thing they have mentioned. This is analogous to the
use of the future of today (see §6.2.3).
On the other hand, a person who uses this form and then fails to do what they have
said at all will incur some social displeasure. The use of this form is in some ways a
promise to do the thing spoken of. The implication is that the speaker will perform the
act in the near future, though it is possible that events will prevent the person from
doing so and they will then complete the action later on.","[250, 251, 252]"

This alternation between diminutive and masculine or feminine can reflect a shifting
focus on the properties of the referent of the noun phrase as perceived by the speaker,
vis. the size or affection towards the object.
There are a few places in Mehek grammar where there is either no possibility of a
diminutive value or the diminutive form is rarely used, although coding of
person/number/gender is possible. One situation where there is no possibility of a
diminutive value is in the possessive pronouns (§5.4.4), where one must code the
possessor as masculine or feminine. A similar situation arises with the object form of
personal pronouns (§5.4.2). There is again no diminutive form, though curiously the
form of the feminine object pronoun is te, the form we would expect if there were a
diminutive object pronoun, rather than what would be the expected form se (which
does not exist). With the subject form of personal pronouns, there is a diminutive form
tu, but it is rarely used.
Within a text, it is possible for a given referent to be treated as masculine or
feminine part of the time but as diminutive part of the time. For example, the text in
Appendix 1 (Text A.1), there are two women, both wives of the male character in the105text. The first wife is treated as feminine in sentence (4) and continues as such until
sentence (28), where she is treated as diminutive, though this occurs in a direct
quotation by the husband. And in sentence (30), she is treated as feminine, though this
too occurs in a direct quotation, but by the second wife. In sentence (33), she is treated
as diminutive but although this is not a direct quotation, the sentence is saying that the
husband feels bad for her, so the choice of diminutive may reflect the husband’s
feelings. In sentences (36) and (37) and subsequent sentences, she is again treated as
feminine. The second wife is initially treated as diminutive in sentence (5). However, in
subsequent sentences she is treated as feminine.
It is possible to have alternations between diminutive and feminine or masculine
gender or plural number for the same referent within the same sentence. In (15), the
subject aye barmbar has a coreferential feminine pronoun su following it, but the two
predicates of this clause, kandat 'thin' and kaiembot 'small' both bear diminutive
predicate clitics (and the verbs of the next two clauses, both suknat 'sleep', also bear
diminutive inflection). However, this could be attributed to the fact that the diminutive
subject pronoun tu is rarely used.

106A similar example is given in (16), where the mosquito is treated as diminutive in
the first clause, both by the noun phrase clitic on fit 'mosquito' and the predicate clitic
on ata 'very', while in the next clause the possessive form is sokom, which now treats
the mosquito as feminine. However, this can be explained by the lack of a possessive
pronoun indicating a diminutive possessor.

Another example of this is given in (17). The noun phrase naku walo 'walo sago' is the
possessor of kulka 'leaf' and the possessive pronoun sokot bears feminine inflection for
the possessor, while in the clause at the end, it is treated as diminutive, as illustrated by
the diminutive predicate clitic on kufet 'good'.

might expect the resulting noun phrase to be plural, but instead we get diminutive
predicate clitics on the three predicate adjectives.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"
"16227.2.1 Realis ka
The more common, by far, of the two mood particles is ka.11 It occurs very
frequently and many utterances would be ungrammatical without it. This particle is
'realis' because it only occurs in clauses which are considered by the speaker to involve
situations that have really occurred, to be occurring, or to be reasonably certain to
occur. Commonly occurring events, expected or inferred events, or events the speaker
feels well in control of require the realis. Almost all present and past events fall under
this umbrella. Examples (23) and (24) illustrate basic clauses with a realis particle.

"396In addition to whistles as a form of communication, there are also some
conventionalized noises that speakers make for fixed meanings. An attempt has been
made to render these sounds into writing by using some of the typical English spelling

accurately convey the sound. The known sounds are listed in Table 51.

Furthermore, when people see each other at a distance, but will not get close
enough to speak in normal tones, there are some conventional ways of yelling. These
include lengthening the vowel(s) of each word to make it easier to shout. It is also quite
common to end each utterance with a long /o/ vowel sound with a falling intonation.
This indicates that a particular segment is over and the listener can then verify that he
heard everything and continue listening, ask for repetition, or make his own comment.","[412, 413]"

imperative pronouns. The forms are shown in Table 25.

amafunkumofomTable 25: Imperative Pronouns
The only unique imperative forms are those for first person. The third person forms
are identical to the third person demonstrative pronouns (see §5.4.6) while the forms
for second person are identical with the second person subject pronouns. Verbal
marking for imperative mood is accomplished by use of a bare verb stem, and the use of
an imperative pronoun together with the verb stem is otherwise the only way to
indicate a command. For second person commands, the dual and plural pronouns are116obligatory with the bare verb, while the second person singular pronoun is optional.
