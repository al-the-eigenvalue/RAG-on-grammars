"Basque inor/ezer can take modifiers that only apply to universal quantifiers,
such as ia 'almost':Negation549(1177) Ια
inor
ez da
etorri.
almost anybody not AUX come
'Almost nobody came.'
The position of the universal quantifier can be, but doesn't have to, before
the negative in these cases:
(1178) Ez da ia inor etorri.
If negative universal quantifiers must be in an agreement relation with the
negative particle, as suggested above, orders such as (1178) can be due to a
further displacement to the left of the complex negation+auxiliary.
The ambiguity presented in (1175) only arises when the two polarity elements are clausemate:
(1179) Inork
ez du
uste [ezer
(ere)
anybody.ERG not AUX think anything (at.all)
gertatu denik].
happen AUX.COMP.PRTT
'Nobody thinks that anything happened.'
(Can't mean) 'Nobody thinks that nothing happened.'
The universal quantifier reading of Basque negative words does not arise
under licensers other than negation and second term of comparatives: their
distribution is thus much more restricted than that of negative polarity
items. Basque behaves in this regard as other languages which have two series of negative constituents (one universal, one existential) distinguished by
the mere presence of a focus feature (e.g. Greek, as shown by Giannakidou
1997). In Basque, both universal quantifiers and polarity items require the
overt presence of a negation particle.","[578, 579]"
"541*(ez).
notWithout a clausemate negation, or some other licenser (see below), negative
words are not acceptable (again for most speakers). This also means that,
differently from other negative polarity items such as any- forms in English,
they don't have a 'free-choice' interpretation:
(1151)*Ezer
jango

AUX.POT
Ί would eat anything (intended meaning).'",[571]
"4.5.4. Negative constituents
4.5.4.1. Negative polarity items
Negative polarity items in Basque are built on words which are homonymous with the question words, by the addition of a prefix e- (>i- by dissimilation) (Michelena 1985[1961]: 67, 304), probably related to negation ez
'in-, not, no' (3.1.6.1.4):
(1149) a. i-nor
b. i-noiz
c. i-non
d. i-nora
e. e-zer
f. e-zein + Ν'anybody'
'ever'
'anywhere (location)'
'anywhere (direction)'
'anything'
'any n' (literary)Although these polarity items seem to incorporate morphologically a negative element, for most speakers, they don't have a negative value by themselves. They need the presence of an independent clausemate negation, as
shown by the contrast in (1150):Negation(1150) Zer
ekarri duzu? Ezer
what bring AUX
anything
'What did you bring? Nothing.'","[570, 571]"
"4.5.4.2. The syntactic distribution of negative words
Both non-polar elements and negative polarity items can occur preceding
negation. Unlike non-polar elements such as subject noun phrases (1162b),
however, negative polarity items in pre-negative position must be adjacent
to the negative head (1162a) (Ortiz de Urbina 1989b):
(1162) a.",[574]
"I.ERG have
also not have
mind.in
Ί don't even HAVE it in mind.' [Atx. Ob.:21]
(1008)lKUSI ERE ezduegin.see
also not AUX do
'He hasn't even SEEN it.'
In the preceding examples, behin ere receives the interpretation 'not once',
rather than 'once not', and the polarity element inor is licensed in the interpretation 'nobody'. Moreover, unlike with the regular focalized elements,
there is no presupposed proposition, negative or otherwise. The last example shows that verbs may be focalized in negative sentences; the prenegation position is then occupied by the participle (usually reinforced with
ere 'also'), while the 'original' position the verb would occupy to the right
of negation is filled with the dummy verb egin. Sentence (1007) contains a
focalized verb where the 'original' position is occupied by a synthetic form
of the verb itself. This strategy emphasizes the event/state denoted by the
verb, as in verb-focalization with egin in positive clauses (see 4.4.3.2.1
above).
If not focalized, pre-negative elements are interpreted as topics/scrambled elements:Focalization 507

Eastern dialects present another alternative for negative focalization, where
only the auxiliary is preposed. The negative particle is left behind along
with the participle:
(1011)JONEKduliburuaezirakurri.","[536, 537]"
"504 SyntaxEastern dialects possess an alternative strategy, whereby only the auxiliary is preposed and the negative element appears joined with the participle:
(995) Norkduwho.ERGliburuaAUX bookezirakurri?notread'Who hasn't read the book?'
Such construction is totally impossible in western dialects. It is not clear
whether this pattern represents a different strategy or whether it corresponds
to constituent negation. See Lafitte (1944) and Oyha^abal (1985).
Negative yes/no questions are not marked in any special way other than
the presence of the negative particle ez. The yes/no interrogative particle al
and the northern yes/no complementizer -a may be found in these negative
questions:
(996) Ez
notal gara lagunhandiak?","[533, 534]"
"564 SyntaxWith two overt negations, negative coordination behaves as a negative
quantifier (as English nothing), whereas with a single negation, it behaves
as a polarity item. The difference only surfaces 'long distance'.","[593, 594]"
"4.4.7. Focalization and interrogation in negative clauses
4.4.7.1. Negative questions
Negative wh-questions are formed in the same way as positive questions:
the wh-word will occur immediately to the left of the tensed verbal form.
However, when the latter is an auxiliary, it will appear displaced to the left
of the clause, away from the position to the right of the participle it occupies
in positive sentences (see 4.5). Indirect negative wh-questions are formed in
the same way, differing only in that their tensed verbal form is marked with
the complementizer -n:
(992) Norkez du
ulertu
esan
not AUX understand say
'Who did not understand what I said?'
who.ERG(993) Zergatik
whydudana?
AUX.COMP.DETezdukdeitzenostatura?notAUXcall.lMPFbar.to'Why don't you call the bar?' [Atx. Ob.:205]
(994) Zergatik
whyezerregutuharibitxibatzukutznotbeghe.DATjewelsomelend(RAD)ziezazkion ?
AUX(SUBJ).COMP'Why not beg her to lend her some jewels?' [Atx. 06.:219]
In the first two examples the constituents to the right of the participle could
also have been placed in between the neg+auxiliary unit and the participle.
The third sentence provides an example of a tenseless negative question.
Some dialects occasionally admit negative questions where no split between
the auxiliary and the main verb takes place. Such uninverted negative questions have a rhetorical flavor. The 'unbroken' negative pattern was more
widespread in older stages of the language.",[533]
"3.1.2.4. The partitive
Many textbooks classify the partitive affix -ik as a case-form, but in fact this
-ik cannot be added to a full NP with a determiner, but only to a determinerless sequence of the type called an N-bar in some theoretical frameworks;
here, therefore, we treat it as a determiner, but a rather special one, since a
partitive NP cannot take any further overt case-marking. The partitive is a
polarity item, and it occurs chiefly in polarity contexts, in positions in which
an absolutive would otherwise occur (see de Rijk 1972a). The main polarity
contexts are listed below:
(a) Negative clauses. Partitives occur regularly as the direct object or intransitive subject of a negated verb:
(82) a. Ez dugu/daukagu ogi-rik.
not have
bread.PRTT
'We don't have any bread.'
(83) b. Gaur ez da hemen ume-rik
jaio.
today not AUX here
baby.PRTT be.bom
'No baby has been born here today.'
Some negated main verbs such as uste 'think' also allow partitives inside
their complement clauses, as do inherently negative verbs like debekatu
'forbid', ukatu 'deny', etc. See 4.10.1.1.4 for complement clauses marked
partitive. 'Negation' must be understood here in a loose way, since formallyThe noun phrase125positive sentences containing semantically negative adverbs such as nekez
'hardly', gutxitan 'seldom' may also license partitive phrases.
(b) Complements of 'affective' predicates such as arraroa izan 'be strange,
funny', harrigarria izan 'be surprising', harritu 'amaze', gaitza izan 'be
hard', ebitatu 'avoid', sentitu 'be sorry' admit partitive phrases.
(c) Interrogative clauses. Main and embedded yes-no questions are typical
contexts where partitive expressions are found:
(84) Behar dugu ogi-rik?
need AUX bread.PRTT
'Do we need any bread?'","[154, 155]"
"This adjacency requirement between the negative head and the negative polarity item suggests a structural relation of agreement (Haegeman 1995),
whereas the free placement of the subject suggests its realization as a topic
(Ortiz de Urbina 1989b). It is obvious, however, that this agreement relation
does not strictly involve negative features: if it did, then we wouldn't expect
the post-negative position of negative polarity items, unless such an agreement relation is optional. There is, on the other hand, a clear asymmetry between the prenegative and the postnegative domains regarding the licensing
of negative polarity items: whereas in the postverbal domain more than oneNegation 545negative polarity item can be licensed, the preverbal domain only provides
room for one:
(1163) a. Inork
ez du
ezer
anybody.ERG not AUX anything
'Nobody did anything.'
b. ΊΊInork
ezer
ez du
anybody.ERG anything not AUX
'Nobody did anything (intended).'
c. Ez du
inork
ezer
not AUX anybody.ERG anything
'Nobody did anything.'egin.
do
egin.
do
egin.
doThis asymmetry is also related to the semantic interpretation of the negative
words. Polarity items which are clearly existential cannot occur preceding
the negative:
(1164) a. Ez da
ezer
askorik
gertatu.
not AUX anything much.PRTT happen
'It didn't happen much.'
b. *Ezer
askorik
ez da
gertatu.
anything much.PRTT not AUX happen
'(?)Not much happened.'
This fact should be related to the behavior of some downward entailing
quantifiers in Basque, such as gutxi 'few', which only admit a prenegative
position:
(1165) a. Jende gutxik
ez du
ezer
egin.
people few.ERG not AUX anything do
'Few people didn't do anything.'
b. *Ez
du
jende
gutxik
ezer
egin.
not AUX people few.ERG anything do
'Few people didn't do anything (intended).'
In fact, quantifiers such as gutxi behave similarly to focus operators in that
they induce a change in the basic word order of the clause. Those quantifiers must occupy the preverbal position, irrespective of their grammatical
function (see 4.4.2):546 Syntax(1166) a. Jende gutxik
ikusi du
hori.
people few.ERG see
AUX that
'Few people saw that.'
hori ikusi du.
b. *Jende gutxik
people few.ERG that see AUX
'Few people saw that (intended).'
If the comparison between prenegative polarity items, downward entailing
quantifiers such as gutxi, and focus operators is significant, then some focus
feature must be involved in those cases.
The previous restrictions concerning the pre-negative position of polarity
items do not hold in relative clauses:
(1167)inorkinoriegingoezdionanybody.ERGanybody.DATdo.FUTnotAUX.COMPproposamena
proposal.DET'the proposal that noone will do to anyone'
In embedded clauses, there is a mild contrast depending on whether the negation plus auxiliary complex is preverbal or postverbal. If it is postverbal,
then it behaves as a relative clause, imposing no restrictions on the position
of negative words (1168a). If it is preverbal, it behaves as matrix clauses
(1168b):
(1168) a.","[574, 575, 576]"
"[Inork

anything buy.FUT not AUX.COMP
Jonek.sayJon.ERGanyone.ERG
AUX'Jon said that noone will buy anything.'
b. Ί [Inork ezer ez duela erosiko] esan du Jonek.
The discussion of examples (1162-1163) assumed that any indefinite polarity element can occupy a position preceding negation. This is only true
when no other such item follows negation:
(1169) a. Inori
ez diote
anybody.DAT not AUX

helpNegationb. Ezer
anythingc.ezduteerosi.notAUXbuy547'They didn't buy anything.'
Ezerk

When other negative polarity items follow negation then a 'superiority' effect arises: only those indefinites whose case-marking corresponds to the
structurally higher function (as compared to the other negative words) can
precede negation. Consider for instance the following contrasts:
(1170) a.","[576, 577]"
"Focalization 5054.4.7.2. Focalization in negative clauses
Just like wh-words, foci may appear immediately to the left of the tensed
verbal form. The focalized constituent is pronounced with contrastive stress:
(1000)JONEKezdueskaeraJon.ERG not AUX petitionsinatu.sign'JON did not sign the petition'
(1001)HORREGATIK ez

proposal
my
favor.in
came.because'That is why I did not reply to my friends, because their proposal
was beneficial to me.' [Atx. Ob.:77]
This focus is interpreted outside of the scope of negation: in the first example above, we identify Jon as the person about whom the presupposed negative statement not sign the petition is true. Similarly, in the following example, a reason is identified that explains why the event answering my friends
did not take place. Thus, continuations like the following are unfelicitous:
(1002)#JONEK ez du eskaera sinatu, Peruk baizik.
'JON did not sign the petition, but Peru.' (cf. [1025])(1003)#HORREGATlK ez
bategatiknienlaguneiarrapostu,bestearrazoiotherreasonbaizik.one.because but
'That is why I did not reply to my friends, but because of another
reason.'
On the other hand, other elements dependent on negation for their interpretation do fall under the scope of negation when focalized in this position.
This is illustrated below with the polarity item inor 'anyone' and with ere
'also', which, although not strictly speaking a polarity element, often takes
on the interpretation '(not) even' when in association with the negative element (4.5.4.5.2). Just like with polarity elements, this interpretation may be
achieved in a position following the negative element but also in the immediate pre-ez position if the element is focalized:506Syntax(1004)BEHIN EREezdiagujakingomuskerrarekinoncealsonotAUXknow.FUTgertatuzena.lizard.withhappen AUX.COMP.DET

Examples like these are reported in Villasante (1980:259), Osa (1990:114),
Hualde et al. (1994:169-170) and Hidalgo (1996) among others. The operator in these sentences is separated from the rest of the clause to its left by a
pause or intonational break. Where the constituent to the right is a focalized
element the usual interpretation is that of a corrective focus: somebody's utterance or presupposition is corrected with respect to that constituent.
Where it is a wh-word, it is interpreted as a marked echo-question. This position for marked emphasis is not just post-verbal, but final in the clause.
Pied-piped clauses may also occur in this marked position. When the
pied-piping operator is a wh-word, they cannot be interpreted as regular whquestions, but rather as marked, echo-questions

As mentioned in the introduction, there are cases where some constituents
intervene between the wh-word and the verb. This is particularly common
with cause wh-words. Moreover, it seems that the objects may intervene between a wh-word or focus and the verb, producing sentences marginally
better than those involving other cases of lack of adjacency:

R. Etxepare
4.5.1. The category of negation
Morphological and syntactic evidence support the idea that the negation
particle ez in Basque is an element of category X°, a head. The morphological evidence is constituted by its word-internal presence in a handful of
adjectives and nouns with negative meaning:
(1061) a. ezdeus ADJ 'insignificant' (<ez 'not' + deus 'anything')
b. gauzaez ADJ 'incapable' (<gauza 'capable'+ ez)
c. ezezagun ADJ 'unknown' (<ez+ezagun 'known')
(1062) a. ezbehar Ν 'accident' (<ez+behar 'need')
b. ezbide Ν 'absurdity' (<ez+bide 'way')
c. ezaxola Ν 'carelessness' (<ez+axola 'care')Negation 517Syntactically, the negative particle has a fixed position in the clause structure (see 4.5.2.1) and can never occur as an adverbial modifier in non-finite
or non-verbal contexts, as other negative particles of adverbial status can
(but see section 4.5.5, for exceptions in contrastive settings and a discussion). Compare, in this regard, the following contrasts:
(1063) a. He waited
[PP for
[not
too long]]
b. II arrivera [PP dans
[pas
longtemps]]
he arrive.will
in
not
too.long
'He will arrive soon.' (from Muller, 1991)
c. *[pp Ez

AUX
'He waited for not too long.'
(1064a. He wore [NP not very expensive clothes]
b. *[MP EZ oso jantzi
garestiak] zeramatzan
not very clothes expensive wore
Ez can be used as a simple answer (as negation heads can generally Spanish,Italian-, but not negative adverbs -French, English):
(1065) A: Etorri
comeal da?
QAUX'Did he arrive?'
B: Ez.
(1066) A: Did he arrive?
B: *NOT/NO(, HE DIDN'T)(1067) A: Est-il
arrive?
B: *Pas/Non.
And it is the target of head movement (section 4.5.2.1) and of syntactic
agreement (section 4.5.4.1). Typologically, Basque is a negative concord
language: it has been argued that negative concord is related to the presence
in a language of a negation head that can by itself negate a clause (see Rowlett 1998, for typological evidence and a proposal in that sense).","[545, 546, 547]"
"The perception of main prominence is independent of the lexical or derived nature of the accent on the word preceding the verb. That is, the same
perception of main prominence is obtained whether the word is lexically accented or unaccented. The phrase with main prominence constitutes an intonational boundary from what follows, starting with the verb; this would be
the division between the two parts we mentioned above.
The verb itself may be the most prominent element, if it is the focus of
the utterance. There are two different types of verb focalization: in the first
type, the emphasis may be placed on asserting the realization of the event
expressed by the verb. That is, the speaker stresses the fact that the event has
occurred, is occurring or will occur. In the second type, the speaker wishes
to emphasize the realization of the type of event expressed by the verb,
stressing that it is that type of event that has occurred, is occurring or will
occur, and not any other type of event. Thus, one of the contexts in which
this type of focalization may be used is in contexts in which the speaker
wishes to correct what another speaker stated (cf. section 4.4.3.2 for more
syntactic details on these two types of verb focalization).
In the first type, in analytical forms the last syllable of the main verb receives a pitch accent (cf. [10a]). In synthetic forms, the prefix ba- is inserted
before the verb, and the pitch accent falls on the last syllable of the verb if it
is unaccented (cf. 10 b.); if the verb is accented, two pitch accents surface,
one on the prefix ba- and another on the penultimate syllable of the syn-Intonation81thetic verb (cf. [10c]). In the second type, besides the main verb receiving a
pitch accent on its final syllable, the dummy verb eiii 'do' is inserted between the main verb and the auxiliary, both in analytic and synthetic forms
(cf. [11]). The word receiving focal accent is written in boldface:
(10) a. Mikelekdeitxu dotzoMikel.ERG callAUXMireneri.
Miren.DAT'Mikel has called Miren.'
(asserting that the event of Mikel calling Miren has taken place)
b. Badator gero aitxtixa.
ba-come later grandpa
'Grandpa is coming later.'
(asserting that the event of grandpa coming will take place)
c. Bädakärre dirua.
ba-bring

'They are bringing the money.'
(asserting that the event of them bringing the money is taking
place)
(11) Mikelekdeitxü eiii ddotzoMikel.ERG calldo AUXMireneri.
Miren.DAT'Mikel has called Mary.'
(stressing the event of calling, as opposed to any other type of event)
In negative clauses, the negative particle and/or the auxiliary verb or synthetic verb following it usually receive main prosodic prominence in the utterance, although not in all circumstances (see [14] below). If the auxiliary
or synthetic verb following the negative element es 'no, not' (ez in Standard
Basque) is unaccented, the last syllable of the auxiliary or verb receives a
pitch accent and the negative particle is pronounced as part of the verb. If
the auxiliary or synthetic verb is accented, both the negative particle and the
penultimate syllable of the auxiliary or synthetic verb surface with a pitch
accent. Thus, compare (12a), where the negative particle is followed by the
unaccented auxiliary totzu (= dotzu., with devoicing of the initial consonant
after /s/) with (12b), where the negative particle is followed by the accented
auxiliary gait:nie:

"Negative polarity items can only occur to the immediate left of negation,

"3.6.4. Expressions with ere 'also; even'
Ere 'also' is an enclitic to the phrase it modifies: ni ere Ί also', inoiz ere ez
'never'. As such it is excluded from sentence-initial position:326Morphology(491) a. Ni ere joango naiz herrira
bihar.
I too go.FUT AUX village.ALL tomorrow
Ί also will go to the village tomorrow.' (in addition to someone
else going)
b. Ni herrira ere joango naiz bihar.

where else)
c. Ni bihar ere joango naiz herrira.
Ί will go to the village tomorrow too.' (in addition to going some
other day)
d. *ere ni joango naiz herrira bihar
As illustrated in the examples above, the constituent bearing ere often
occupies the preverbal focal position. When the element modified by ere is
the verb, it is often syntactically focalized with egin 'to do' (see section
4.4.3):
(492) Sugeak, jan ere egin ditut
snakes eat also do AUX
'As for snakes, I have even eaten them.'
(cf. sugeak ere jan ditut Ί have eaten even snakes.')
It is, however, possible for the verb to be modified by ere exclusively, without egin 'to do':

disposition better.with eatlMPF AUX drink.lMPF
ere dute gehiago.
also AUX more
'They eat with more appetite, and they also drink more.'
[Duv. L.L.:149]
Note, furthermore, that it is also possible to use ere 'also' with topicalized
material, even with verbs:Conjunctions and connectors(494) Orain ez duguna
nown o t have.C0MP.DETlor327dezakeguget(RAD) AUX.POTeta luzaro gäbe lortu, lortu ere.
and long not get
get also
'We can get what we do not have now, and even get it before long.'
[Mitx. EIG VI: 134]
Ere is also used in negative sentences: ni ere ez naiz joango herrira Ί
will not go to the village either'. Curiously, with this negative value in older
texts we find the expression hain gutxi 'neither, not either', lit. 'so little',
which appears to be a direct caique of Sp tampoco: ez dut beldur beroa,
hain gutxi izotza Ί don't fear the heat, and neither the ice'. This expression
is somewhat archaic or literary nowadays.
In elliptical affirmative sentences ere is optionally but frequently followed by bai 'yes':
(495) Jon herrira
joango da bihar
eta ni ere (bai).
Jon village.ALL go.FUT A U X tomorrow and I too (yes)
'Jon will go to the village tomorrow and I will too.'
(496) Zuk
badakizu eta nik
ere (bai).
you.erg know
and I.ERG too (yes)
'You know it and I do too.'
In elliptical negative sentences the use of ez 'no' after ere is obligatory:
Jon ez da herrira joango bihar eta ni ere ez 'Jon will not go to the village
and neither will I'; zuk ez dakizu eta nik ere ez 'you don't know it and neither do I'. Alternatively, the expression baita (affirmative, < bai eta) or ezta
(negative, < ez eta) precedes the modified element and ere follows it in elliptical sentences: baita ni ere Ί do too' (= ni ere bai)] ezta Jonek ere 'neither does Jon' (= Jonek ere ez)', baita guri ere 'also to us' (= guri ere bai).
Being a clitic, ere can not constitute an utterance by itself. On the other
hand, baita (ere) and ezta (ere) can be used as answers to questions: Jon
etorriko da, eta zu? — Baita (ere) 'Jon will come, and you? — I will too';
Jonek ez du egingo, eta zuk? - Ezta (ere) 'Jon will not do it, and you? — I
won't either'.

Besides meaning 'also', ere also has the value of 'even' and is often used
in concessive subordinate clauses: pobrea bada ere 'even if s/he is poor',
konforme ez banago ere 'even if I don't agree', zure laguna banaiz ere
'even if I am your friend' (see section 4.10.2.1.4).
Another use of ere is as an intensive element in a number of expression:
beti ere 'always, always', nolanahi ere 'in whichever way, in any case', izan
ere 'in fact'. This intensifying function is particularly prominent in negative
sentences: ezer ere (ez) 'nothing at all', inon ere (ez) 'nowhere at all', behin
ere (ez) '(not) even once', giving rise to negative polarity items like batere
'at all' (< bat 'one' + ere).","[355, 356, 357, 358]"
"Mikel.ERGyesba'Jon didn't buy wine but Mikel did.'
The bound morpheme ba- expresses a contradicting affirmation, one that
negates a negative proposition or, alternatively, one that holds the positive
value of a proposition against a negative statement of that proposition.
Arejita provides the following minimal discourse:
(1143) A: Ez dozu ikusi, bada.
not AUX see
then
B: Badot
ikusi.
ba. AUX see
'You didn't see it then. I DID see it.'
In western dialects, but not in eastern ones (Oyhar^abal 1984:365), the presence of ba- is incompatible with some other element in focus, as in Zer
duzu? Dirua badut. 'What do you have? I have money'.
Arejita (1988) claims that as a marker of emphatic affirmation, ba- has a
more restricted occurrence in embedded clauses. It is excluded in subordinate clauses headed by the complementizer -en (interrogatives, subjunctives
and relatives), whereas it is acceptable in those headed by -ela (but see
4.4.5.1.1):Negation 539(1144) a.","[568, 569]"
"To contribute a free-choice reading, we must add the prefix edo- (lit. 'or') or

The eastern forms behave differently in that they can directly convey a

'Who came? No one.'
As indicated in 3.1.6.1.4, polarity items in Basque can be licensed by: (i)
negation (1155a), (ii) yes/no questions (1155b), (iii) rhetorical questions542Syntax(1155c), (iv) protasis of conditionals (1155d), (ν) second term of comparative structures (1155e), (vi) before clauses (1155f), (vii) without clauses

(ix) 'affective' predicates (including exclamatory verbs and verbs of fearing) (1155i), (x) internal arguments of distributive universal quantifiers
(1155j), and (xi) excess comparatives introduced by the affix -egi (1155k)
(see de Rijk 1972b, 1996b):

"Laka (1990) observes that narrow scope negation does not license negative
polarity items:
(1206)*Inork

ez
aurdiki.
anybody.ERG
AUX

throw
'Lit. '*Anybody did not throw it' (nobody threw it).'",[589]
"3.5.7. Modal particles
A small set of particles can be attached immediately to the left of the tensed
verbal form (whether auxiliary or synthetic verb) to modulate and validate
the information conveyed by the clause: omen 'hearsay information', ei
'hearsay information; Bizk.', bide 'apparently', al 'yes/no question; desiderative', ote 'rhetorical question'. These particles are mutually exclusive for
any single verb:
(455) Egia osoajakinomendu.truth whole know apparently AUX'He has apparently found out the whole truth.'
(456) Egia osoa omen daki.
knows'He apparently knows the whole truth.'
(457) ez otedadagoeneko istilunegAUXalreadyquarrelgarratzik sortuarlo honetan?bitterfield this.LOCappear'Have there not been bitter fights already in this area?'
[Mitx. EIG VII:156]
Nothing else may intervene between the tensed verbal form and the particle, and any process affecting the former will also affect the latter. Thus,
displacement of the tensed form to the left in negative clauses (4.5.2) or in
marked focalization structures in eastern dialects (4.4.2) carries modal particles with it:
(458) Asmatu, ez omen zuen hiruzpalau
inventnotAUX three.or.fourbaizik egin.
butmake'As for inventing, he has not apparently invented but three or four.'
[Mitx. EIG ΥΠ:32]Verbs 317(459) Aitak omen du
aurdiki.
father.ERG
AUX throw
'It was father who apparently threw it.' [Lafitte 1944, §117]
Modal particles are closely associated with inflection: they may not occur
in tenseless verbal forms, and pattern with inflection itself in that, unlike
other preverbal elements (such as negative ez or 'positive' ba) they do not
'count' as first elements shielding tensed forms from initial position (see
4.4.3). Contrast in this respect the following two examples:
(460) ez dator
not comes
's/he is not coming'
(461) *omen dator
comes
's/he is apparently coming'
As usual, presence of the morpheme ba can salvage the latter case (ote
used to be exceptional in this respect, as indicated in the following section).
There is further syntactic evidence that particles 'count' as inflection: they
are the only elements which may stand between the participle and its auxiliary in positive analytic verbal forms, and they are also the only elements
that may 'intervene' between the focalized element and a synthetic verb.
Phonetically, they also form an accentual group with the tensed verb
(Hualde et al. 1994).","[346, 347]"
"556Syntax4.5.4.5.2. Ere 'even/also'
Minimizers can also be constructed out of an indefinite expression with the
addition of the particle ere. Ere 'also/even' is a polarity item under negation, attaching to the right of the constituent that is under the scope of negation (on the presence of dummy egin 'do' in [1196], see 4.4.7.2):
(1195) a. Ez du
hitz
bat esan (baizik eta hi).

'He didn't say one word (but two).'
b. Ez du

but
two
'He didn't say a word (*but two).'
(1196) Ez da
matrikulatu ere
not AUX register
even
'He didn't even register.'(egin).
(do)Ere is also licensed in protasis of conditionals, without-clauses, and finite
dependents of negative predicates with the 'even' reading:
(1197) a. Hitzbatereegitenbadu,akabatukodut.wordoneevendo.iMPFif.AUXkill.FUTAUX'If he says (even) one word, I'll kill him.'
b. Hitz bat ere

word one even say without leave AUX
'He left without saying even one word.'
c. Ez dakit [matrikulatu ere egin den].
not know register even do AUX.COMP
Ί don't know whether he even registered.'
In positive main clauses, ere is ambiguous between an 'even' reading and a
'too/also' reading when it follows a focal constituent (1198). If it follows a
non-focal constituent, the 'even' reading disappears (1199):
(1198) a.","[585, 586]"

[[Inor

esan dutenik]

deniedAUX'He denied that they said that anyone was put in jail.'
As shown by the examples above, negative polarity items can be licensed
even when there is no direct selection relation between the clauses contain-Negation559ing the licenser and the licensee. The most embedded clauses, the ones containing the negative polarity item, do not necessarily take the partitive (although they can). On the other hand, the presence of the partitive in the first
embedded clause is crucial:
(1204) a.","[588, 589]"
"4.5.4.6. The syntactic domain of polarity licensing
Negative words such as inor 'anyone' or ezer 'anything' can be licensed not
only by a clausemate polarity trigger, but also in dependent clauses:
(1200) a. Ezdutuste[inornot AUX believe anybody
Ί don't think anybody came.'etorridenik].comecome.COMP.PRTTb.",[587]
"Turning now to particularities of ahal, there is wide dialectal variation as
regards the aspectual shape of the lexical verb it requires. We will outline
the major patterns generally found in the standard language:
(448) ikus ahal dezake
seecanAUX.POT's/he can see it'(bare root with potential auxiliary)Verbs(449) ikusi/ikusten
ahal du
see.PRF/see.lMPF can AUX

imperfective [east])(450) ikusi
ahal izan du
see.PRF can be.PRF AUX
's/he has been able to see it'(perfective participle
with perfective izan)315(451) ikusi/ikusten
ahal izaten du (perfective [west] vs
see.PRF/see.lMPF can be.lMPF AUX imperfective [east])
's/he can usually see it'
(452) ikusi/ikustenahalkodusee.PRF/see.lMPF can.FUT AUX(perfective [west] vs.
imperfective[east])'s/he will be able to see it'
As indicated, western dialects favor the perfective participle throughout,
while eastern varieties prefer the imperfective form unless perfective
izan/ukan is used. In non-standard western usage, perfective participles are
employed with the potential auxiliary in sentences like the one in the first
example, since the radical is never used in those varieties.
The modal ahal is homophonous with the interrogative particle al in
Gipuzkoan, where the latter is mainly used, and with the desiderative particle ahal. As pointed out in the grammar of Euskaltzaindia (1987:456), they
illustrate well the difference between particles and modal semiauxiliaries.
This can be observed in the following sentences, where the different patterns
produced by negation are illustrated:
(453) Ez ahal da
oinez
etorriko!
(particle)
neg can AUX on.foot come.FUT
'Would that s/he came on foot!'
(454) Ez daoinezetortzenahalko. (semiauxiliary)neg AUX on.foot come.LMPF can.FUT'S/he will not be able to come on foot.'
In the first example, ahal is a desiderative particle, dragged along with the
auxiliary by negation to the left edge of the clause. Future is marked on the
lexical 'main' verb. On the other hand, in the second example, ahal is a mo-316Morphologydal semiauxiliary verb taking a subordinate verb phrase oinez etortzen.
Negative preposing only takes along the auxiliary da, and future marking is
attached to the main verb ahal itself.","[344, 345, 346]"
"551i.egiteko.
do.toAs with negative polarity items, some speakers also admit partitives under
epistemic modals (from de Rijk 1996b):
(1182) a.",[581]
"82Phonologyb. Guri
es gaitxüe eser
emon.
we.DAT not AUX
anything give
'They haven't given us anything.'
Also, in imperative forms in which the negative particle is followed by a
participial verb, the negative particle receives focal accent:
(13) Es
etorri gure etxera!
not come our house, to
'Don't come to our house!'
A word or phrase preceding the negative particle may be focalized, in
contrastive or corrective contexts:
(14) Kepak
es täu amaitxu ondinoko, es Mirenek.
Kepa.ERGnot AUX finish
yet
not Miren.ERG
'It is Kepa the one that has not finished yet, not Miren.'
Α postverbal word or phrase may receive main prosodic prominence and be
interpreted as new information. These cases often occur when the speaker
takes a longer time to retrieve the focus or most important element, as if s/he
were hesitating or trying to remember the piece of new information. Utterances with postverbal prosodic prominence often present semantically
empty fillers such as baaa... 'well' or eee... 'um, er' between the verb and
what follows. They are more common with copulative verbs (cf. [15] below)
and when the focalized constituent is relatively long. There is an intonational boundary intervening between the verb and the word or phrase, realized by lengthening of the final segment in the verb and rising intonation.
This can be observed in the FO contour for (15) (cf. Fig. 5 below), where the
vowel of the copula is much longer than any other segment in the utterance,
and the pitch rises until the next word begins with a low tone. To put it in
plain terms, the sentence is pronounced as if it were separated in two parts,
which prosodically constitute two intonational phrases as in (15).","[111, 112]"
"I.INTS.ERG'It is not me that will bring this to you myself, but Jon.'
There is however some disagreement as to whether these emphatic elements
may occur in focus position in negative clauses. The grammar sketch from
the Academy of the Basque language (Euskaltzaindia 1987:84) claims emphatic pronouns are excluded from that position, while Osa (1990:212) finds
them acceptable in certain environments. In the dialect described here, such
elements may in fact be found in non-focal positions, whether in positive or
negative sentences. Therefore, sentences like the following, where an element in quasifocus position to which the emphatic marker -xe has been attached, are also acceptable:514Syntax(1046) Ezdizutoraintxeekarriko,biharbaizik.notAUXnow.lNTSbring.FUTtomorrowbutΊ won't bring it to you right now, but tomorrow.'

Introduction
J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its name
The word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vascones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basquespeaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorrochategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, derived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is parallel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In postRenaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the westernmost dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the political border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a language'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

AUXHowever, in these dependents, unlike in the previous adverbial one, negative polarity items can occur following negation:

"4.5.7. Negative coordination
Neither...nor... constructions are formed with sentential negation taking
various possible scopes: over noun phrase subject and objects (1216b,
1219), verbal items (1217), and verb phrases (1218), and adjectival predicates (1216a). As some examples show, the first negation can be ellided if it
is under the scope of without (1216b) or a clausemate negation (1217,
1219).
(1216) a.",[592]
"The facts concerning the distribution of negation in imperatives square well
with typological generalizations concerning other languages, such as the
Romance languages (Zanuttini 1997, chapter 4). Pre verbal negative markers
that can negate a clause by themselves are incompatible with lexical verbs
in the imperative form, although they are compatible with auxiliary verbs in
the imperative form and with verbal forms from other verbal paradigms,
such as the subjunctive, used as imperatives (cf. Spanish).",[551]

"4.4.3. Yes/no questions and verb focalization
4.4.3.1. Direct yes/no questions
Yes/no questions need not be signalled by any mark other than interrogative
intonation:
(818) Jonek
liburu hori irakurri du?
Jon. ERG book that read
AUX
'Has Jon read that book?'
Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions,
such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a; the former is a verbal particle
(3.5.7), while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers
(3.5.7.3). -a is restricted to direct questions, while al may also be found in
embedded contexts:
(819)Gure literaturak

'To do and undo everything; isn't that the law of this world?' [Etch.
Id. 1:336]There are also syntactic means to mark clauses as direct questions, in particular verb fronting:468 Syntax(821) Baretuko

'Have you heard how our neighbors from Beam themselves praise
their language?' [Etch. Id. 1:200]
The last two examples show that verb-fronting may cooccur with the interrogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a. As usual, a clause-initial
verb may be preceded in turn by any number of topicalized/scrambled elements and a focalized constituent. Since subjects tend to be topics and objects are often focalized (see Hualde et al.1994), this means that it is not
clear whether SOV sentences like the following exclusively involve interrogative intonation on a neutral word order or whether the object has been
focalized:
(824) Baina
butentzuleakegilearenesan-rtahiberberalistener.ERGauthor.GENmeaningsameaditzenaldu?hear.lMPFalAUX'But does the listener hear the same meaning as the author?' [Mitx.
EIG 1:51]
(825) Musikak
music.ERG(...) gertakaribatadierazaldezake?eventaexpress(RAD)alAUX'Can music express an event?' [Mitx. EIG 1:50]Focalization 469
Verb-fronting is perhaps more clearly perceived in yes/no questions with
synthetic verbs. These are clitic-like elements which lean on the element to
their left and which cannot therefore occur in absolute initial position in a
main clause. Where verb-fronting to that position takes place, they are supplemented by the particle ba to their left:
(826)Ba al dugu musikan euskal
eskolarik?
ba al have music.in Basque school.PRTT
'Do we have any Basque school in music?' [Mitx. EIG 1:49](827) Baalduzueidazlanikaski?baalhavemanuscript.PRTTenough'Do you have enough manuscripts?' [Mitx. EIG 1:83]
Topics may occur to the left of the initial verb, which will then also appear
with ba- (828); however, this is not the case if a focalized constituent precedes it: that constituent 'counts' as first element to support the synthetic
verb, as in (829):
(828) Euskal doinuek
ba al dute
berezkotasunik?
Basque songs.ERG ba al have peculiarity.PRTT
'Do Basque songs have any peculiarities?' [Mitx. EIG 1:48]
(829)Kaltegarritzatal daukazuejoerahori?harmful.asaltendencythathave'Do you consider that tendency harmful?' [Mitx. EIG 1:86]4.4.3.2. Verb Focalization
Verb focalization stands out from the main focalization strategy described
in the preceding sections in that it seems to employ, at least in part, different
mechanisms. Since Altube (1929), a distinction has been drawn between
two types of 'verb focalization': a) cases where the event itself is emphasized, contrasting it with other type of events, and b) cases where 'the positive or negative quality of the verb is emphasized', i.e. where what is emphasized is that the action or state did take place or is true, as opposed to not
taking place or not being true. A priori, the contrastive overtones of the former seem more akin to the types of constituent focalization discussed in
section 4.4.2, while positive verbal emphasis falls fully in line with the
yes/no questions discussed in 4.4.3.1 However, both types of verb focaliza-470 Syntaxtion will be discussed in this section in order to prevent dispersion and to
facilitate a sharper distinction between the two. Contrastive event focalization will be dealt with in 4.4.3.2.1, and 4.4.3.2.2 will be devoted to polar
emphasis. Since negation presents additional problems which will be examined in section 4.4.7 below, we will concentrate here on positive polar emphasis.","[497, 498, 499, 500]"
"In this contrastive setting many sequences of negation + constituent are possible that are not in sentence internal position (a general cross-linguistic
fact):
(1210) a. Jon etorri da,
ez
Peru.
Jon come AUX not Peru
'It is Jon who came, not Peru.'
b. Bulegoan dago, ez
etxean.
office.in is
not home.in
'He is at the office, not at home.'
The sequence negation+constituent must be distinguished from the sequence constituent+negation. The latter seems a bona fide case of sentential
ellipsis (see Laka 1990). There are a number of differences among the two
constructions. First, the former, but not the latter, licenses negative polarity
items:Negation(1211) a. Xabier etorri da, baina bestela
inor
Xabier come AUX but
otherwise anybody
'Xabier showed up, but otherwise, nobody did.'
b. Xabier etorri da, *baina bestela ez inor.","[590, 591]"
"4.5.4.3. Negative quantifiers
The cases discussed in (1162-1166) are directly related to the following
ambiguity in multiple polarity word clauses:
(1175) Inork
ez du
ezer
ere
egin.
anyone.ERG not AUX anything at.all done
'Nobody did anything.'
'Nobody did nothing.' (>someone did something)
It seems as if Basque indefinites could be used as either polarity items or
universal quantifiers (they are also licensed in second terms of comparatives, where an existential reading is impossible, see section 4.5.4.1). The
ambiguity of the previous example is linked to two different intonations.
The intonation corresponding to the polarity reading has a main prominent
accent on inork 'nobody' and a secondary accent on preverbal ezer (typically, preverbal elements receive an accent, realized via stress in most dialects). In the universal quantifier interpretation, both inork and ezer have an
equally prominent accent. The intonation pattern is similar to one with focus
and a quasifocus (de Rijk 1996b; see 4.4.7.2.1):
(1176)JONEK
ez du
BERE anaia
bisitatu.
Jon.ERG not AUX his
brother visit
'It is Jon who didn't visit ms brother.'",[578]
"2.1.6.2. Alternations affecting the negative particle
Optionally, the negation ez loses its sibilant before a conjugated verbal form
starting with /n/ or IV\ ez + naiz
enaiz Ί am not', ez luke
eluke 's/he
would not have it', ez litzateke
elitzateke 's/he would not be'. This process is geographically widespread and was represented orthographically in
pre-modern times, but appears to be receding. (For z + ζ ~>tz with negation
see 2.1.2.2)
When followed by -z, the affricate tz results; e.g. zen 's/he was', etzen
's/he was not', zegok 's/he is, stays, ALLOC MASC', etzegok 's/he is, stays,
ALLOC MASC'60PhonologyThe particle ez also causes the devoicing of a following voiced obstruent,
but this is a more general rule (see section 2.1.4.5); e.g. gara 'we are', ezkara 'we are not', dugu 'we have it', eztugu 'we do not have it', dator 's/he
is coming', eztator 's/he is not coming', badoa 'if s/he is going', ezpadoa 'if
s/he is not going'.","[89, 90]"
"472SyntaxAs indicated above, the usage of this particle seems to be a reflection of the
clitic status of synthetic forms, which usually lean on a host to their left.
Such element is missing in clause-initial position, and the particle ba is then
used to support the conjugated verbal form. From this perspective, this particle typically appears as a consequence of verb-fronting, rather than as a
marker of focalization per se. At least since Altube (1929), it has often been
assumed that the particle ba itself is the marker of positive emphasis, an
analysis supported by the relation of this element to the positive particle bai
'yes'. However, this does not explain its restriction to synthetic verbal forms
and, more importantly, disregards the usage of ba in other contexts where
verb fronting takes place, such as yes/no questions (see section 4.4.3.1

'There is in St. Floret a preaching friar called Pillardit.'
[Lertx. O.P.:390]
Sometimes different factors may be combined: in the last example there
could be a contrastive emphasis on the existential verb. See Oyhar^abal
(1984), Rebuschi (1982) for more details on this particle.
The absence of ba makes positive emphatic analytical forms less conspicuous, and Altube (1929:57) claimed that these are exclusively marked
by focal stress. Euskaltzaindia (1985) points out verb initiality as an important syntactic property. However, given the availability of scrambling to the
left of the clause, this property is often anything but salient. Some examples
are given below:

"4.10.3.1.2. Word order within the relative clause
There is a strong word order constraint regarding one constituent within the
relative clause: the relative clause must end with the finite verb form to
which the complementizer is joined. There is no exception to this rule. Even
in negative clauses, where, apart from relatives, the main verb and other
words generally follow the finite auxiliary, the inflected verb must appear at
the end of the relative clause (see 4.5 and 4.10.2.3).
Consider the following example (a), which contains a negative relative
clause. Within this clause the last word is the inflected auxiliary to which
the complementizer is joined (zuen). The marker of negation (ez), although
written as a separate word in standard Basque, is a proclitic, and must precede the auxiliary:Subordination 767(1852) a.","[796, 797]"

As the examples above show, the dependent clauses are all headed by a
complementizer to which the partitive morpheme is attached. Laka (1992)
proposes that polarity items in dependent clauses are directly licensed by the
complementizer+partitive complex. In fact, the partitive morpheme would
be the phonological spell out of a polar feature that licenses the negative
words and which is selected by the matrix clause. The partitive morpheme,
however, only occurs in a subset of the contexts that license a negative polarity item in a dependent clause: epistemic verbs or verbs of speech. In
those contexts, -enik (the complex complementizer+partitive) stands in contrast to the simple declarative complementizer, which forces a factive reading of the dependent clause. Subjunctive dependents of verbs of wish and558Syntaxcommand do not take the partitive morpheme, and also allow negative polarity items:

b. Ez diot agindu [ezer

Similarly, conditional operators do not trigger the presence of a partitive
morpheme, but they do license a polarity item in a dependent clause:

"3.5.7.4. The case of habitual ohi
The particle ohi, indicating habitual aspect, may also intervene between the
participle and the auxiliary. The participle may appear in the perfective form
and, in eastern dialects, in the imperfective form with -t(z)en:
(480) Gure herritik
etorri/etortzen
ohi
our
village.ABL come.PRF/come.IMPF
'S/he usually comes from our village.'da.
AUX(481) Egunkari bi
erosi/erosten ohi ditu.
newspaper two buy.PRF/buy.iMPF AUX
'S/he usually buys two newspapers.'
There is considerable dialectal variation in the use of ohi, which ranges from
a modal particle to a semiauxiliary. The main reason to deal with this aspectual particle along with modal particles is that, in eastern dialects, it is associated with inflection and moves along with it in cases like negation:322 Morphology(482) ez ohi dute erraiten
notongirikAUX say.LMPF well.PRTT'they do not usually speak well [of anyone]' [Ax. 291]
(483) ez ohi dutela
aski
artarekin irakurtzen
neg
AUX.COMP enough care.C0M readJMPF
'that they do not usually read with enough care' [Etch. 1:70]
Western dialects are less systematic in this respect, but as noted in
Euskaltzaindia (1987), ohi is not associated with the inflection but with the
perfective participle in negative clauses:
(484) Ez da
hara joan ohi.
neg AUX there go
'S/he does not usually go there.'
(485) Ez ditu bere etxeko
lanak egin ohi.
not AUX his home.REL work make
'S/he does not usually do his homework.'
This connection with participles is reminiscent of semiauxiliaries
(3.5.6.2) and enables us to treat western ohi as an aspectual auxiliary verb.
As such, and unlike particles, one would expect it to occur in tenseless contexts (although not necessarily; cf. English used to), and this is certainly so
in the case of perfective nominalizations. Imperfective nominalizations, on
the other hand, are not acceptable:
(486) beti
leku berberara joan ohi izanak...
always place same.ALL
go
be.DET.ERG
'having usually gone always to the same place'
(487) beti leku berberara joan ohi izatea...
(488) *beti leku berberara ohi joatea...
The 'verbal' character of western ohi can also be linked to the fact that,
unlike other particles, ohi(tu) may be used as a lexical verb, meaning 'be
used to' (cf. the derived noun ohitura 'custom').
Mujika (1988) relates the usage of ohi as a particle or as a semiauxiliary
with the type of participle it combines with. Where this element is a particle,Verbs 323as in eastern dialects, aspectual information is conveyed by the imperfective
participle. In western dialects, on the other hand, ohi would be closer to an
aspectual auxiliary verb, and the default (perfective) participle is then used
on the lexical predicate.","[351, 352, 353]"

As Laka (1990:213, citing Saltarelli 1988) has pointed out, within the
same dialect, a governing negative verb may accept a finite clause headed
by both -ela or by -enik, but there will be a difference in presupposition:
when headed by the former, the speaker presupposes that the proposition
expressed by the finite clause is a true fact, but no such presupposition is
made when headed by -enik (Laka 1990:214):

[Mitx. EIG 1:143]Subordination 645In example (1475) the author, Κ. Mitxelena, is taking for granted that two
and two are four; and in (1474), when -ela is used we presuppose that the
earth truly revolves around the sun regardless of our daughter's beliefs,
whereas no such presupposition is made with the form -enik. Laka
(1990:214) and Uribe-Etxebarria (1994:173) suggest that a sentence headed
by -enik is necessarily interpreted within the scope of negation, whereas the
opposite would be true of a sentence headed by -ela. See 4.5.4.4.
It is hard not to see that this -enik suffix looks like the combination of the
-en (be it relative or interrogative) plus the partitive determiner -rik. Two
pieces of data confirm this suspicion: just like in the case of the partitive determiner, a yes-no matrix question may reportedly trigger the use of -enik
(instead of the more general -ela) as the head of the embedded noninterrogative clause:

"The noun phrase1553.1.6.1.4. Indefinite pronouns
There are three major classes of indefinite pronouns (and related items), and
these are not equivalent. Almost all are formed from the corresponding interrogatives, by affixation or reduplication.
The first group we may call the 'existential' indefinites; these correspond
to the English indefinites in 'some-', and are formed by suffixing -bait to
the interrogative: norbait 'somebody', zerbait 'something', nonbait 'somewhere', noizbait 'sometime', nolabait 'somehow'. There is no form related
to zein 'which?'
This -bait is historically derived from reanalysis of the verbal prefix bait(see sections 4.10.1.1.6 and 4.10.2.1.3). In the earlier language, therefore,
-bait followed a case-suffix, as in norkbait (ergative) and noribmt (dative).
Today only the restructured forms like norbaitek and norbaiti are in use.
However, internal inflection is still found in norabait '(to) somewhere'
(more common than nonbaitera)
The pronouns norbait and zerbait may be modified, as in zerbait ona
'something good' and ona den zerbait 'something which is good'; note the
presence of the article -a in both constructions. The first construction is only
possible when the pronoun stands in the absolutive case.
The pronoun zerbait may take a diminutive suffix to express 'a little
something'. Eastern varieties use forms like zerbaitto, but western varieties
have a different ordering, with zertxobait.
In eastern varieties (only), zerbait may be used as an indefinite determiner, as in zerbait obra 'some piece of work'.
Equivalent in function, but much less frequent, are nor edo nor 'somebody' and zer edo zer (B zeozer) 'something'; these consist of nor 'who?'
and zer 'what?' reduplicated about edo 'or'.
Semantically similar to norbait, but perhaps emphasizing the sense of
'somebody or other', 'one or another', is a construction involving two instances of bat 'one' connected by edo 'or', by the genitive -en, or by both:
hence, bat edo bat, baten bat, or bat edoren bat.
The second group are the 'free-choice' indefinites; these correspond to
the English indefinites in 'any-' when these are not polarity items. There are
two different sets of these, the first found more or less throughout the country, the second largely confined to the west. The first set is formed by suffixing nahi 'want' to an interrogative: nornahi 'anybody (at all), anyone
(you like)', zernahi 'anything (you like)', nonnahi 'anywhere (you like)',
noiznahi 'any time (you like)', nolanahi 'any way (you like)', zeinnahi 'any,
whichever you like'. These are similar in form to the Castilian items like156 Morphologyquienquiera 'anybody at all', and may have originated as caiques. The second set is formed by prefixing edo 'or' to the corresponding interrogative:
edonor 'anybody at all', edozer 'anything at all', edonon 'anywhere at all',
edonoiz 'any time at all', edonola 'anyhow', edozein 'any'.
The third group are polarity items, and they correspond to English forms
in 'any-' in that function (see 3.1.2.4). In principle, they are formed by prefixing e- to the interrogative, but there are numerous complications, and
northern varieties sometimes use unrelated forms in this function. Examples: ezer 'anything' (but also northern deus), inor (northern nehor) 'anybody', inon (northern nehon) 'anywhere', inoiz (northern nehoiz) 'ever' (but
also sekula[n]), inola (northern nehola) 'in any way'. The form ezein 'any',
from zein 'which?', is now archaic.
All the members of this third group are frequently reinforced by the particle ere 'also' (B bere or be). They occur in polarity contexts, typically under negation and in questions:
(121) Ez dut ezer(ere) ikusi.
not AUX anything see
Ί didn't see anything.'
(122)Inorkez duezererosi. (with two of these items)anyone not AUX anything buy'Nobody bought anything.'
(123) Inoiz ikusi al duzu kometa?
ever see Q AUX comet
'Have you ever seen a comet?'
In eastern varieties, a case-suffix may occasionally follow the reinforcing
ere, as in nehoneretik ez 'from nowhere at all', in place of nehondik ere ezBasque has no negative pronouns or related forms, and these are expressed by combining the items in this third group with ez 'not', as in the
examples just given: inor ez 'nobody', ezer (ere) ez or deus ez 'nothing',
inola (ere) ez 'in no way', and so on. Exception: in eastern varieties, deus or
its extended form deusik can be used in isolation to express 'nothing', without ez\ the same is not true of ezer.
A negative may take a diminutive suffix, as in ezertxo ere ez 'absolutely
nothing'.
An indefinite of the ezer type may be followed by guti ~ gutxi 'few, little' to express 'hardly any...': inor gutxi 'hardly anybody', ezer gutxi 'hardlyThe noun phrase157anything'. A case-ending follows, as in Inor gutxik daki hori 'Hardly anybody knows that'.
The interrogative nor 'who' functions as an indefinite meaning 'the one,
the person' in locutions like this:
(124) Μ ez naiz nor
I not amhori egiteko.who thatdo.NOM.RELΊ am not the one to do that/I am not the right person to do that.'
This is comparable to Castilian Yo no soy quien para hacerlo.
Both nor and inor ~ nehor are occasionally used in the sense of 'person
of quality, worthy person', as in zu nor bazara 'if you are worthy'. A rare
use of nor to mean 'some' is illustrated by the example
(125) Jendea, nor
peoplezaldiz,noroinez,etorri zen.who horse.INSTR who fooUNSTR arrive AUX'The people arrived, some on horseback, some on foot.'
The phrase ez nor eta hura 'not who and he' is attested for 'somebody
unknown', as in
(126) Goizbateanmorning one.LOCarkitu zuen otsoa
findAUX wolf...ez
nork eta ark ilia.
not who and he killed, DET
'In the morning he found a wolf, killed by somebody unknown.'
[Iztueta]
In northern varieties, deus could formerly be used as a noun meaning
'thing', as in hain deus izigarria 'what a terrible thing' and ene deusak 'my
things'. But this is no longer current, and it has never been true of ezer.
The item zer is very commonly used as an indefinite meaning 'something
(or other)'; in this use it is normally treated as a noun, taking the article:
Zera ikusi dut Ί saw something'. In formal styles, especially in writing, this
same zera is often used to fill the focus position just before the verb when
the focused item itself is so long it must be placed at the end of the sentence.
Example:158Morphology(127) Sailburuakzeraadierazi dukazetarienaurrean:minister.ERG s o m e t h i n g explain AUX journalists.GEN front.LOC15.000lanpostu berri sortuko
direla

year.LOC
'The Minister explained to the assembled journalists that 15,000 new
jobs are to be created next year.'
(The intensive demonstrative hauxe and the phrase honako hau roughly,
'this here' can be used in the same way.) The frequent exclamation Bai
zera! means 'Get serious!' 'Yeah, sure!' (in the sarcastic American sense).
In eastern varieties, zer...ere may be wrapped around the bare stem of a
verb to express 'whatever', as in zer gerta ere 'whatever happens'. (For the
use of nor ere for 'whoever' in relative clauses, see section 4.10.3.4.3)
The interrogative zer 'what' is used, with the article -a, when a word is
momentarily forgotten: Zera ikusi nuen, urtxakurra Ί saw a, what's it
called, an otter'. (Indeed, in some southern varieties, the word has apparently been reanalyzed as a single noun zera.) The lost word may never be
supplied, as in the classic
(128 )Zuen zerak
gure zerean
dira.
your what.DET.PL our what.LOC are
'Your whatsits are in our thingy.'
This zer can even be applied to a person, as in Zu, zera, joan hemendik!
'Hey, you, what's-your-name, get out of here!'. In addition, zer can be used
as an adjective expressing a high degree of an unspecified quality, as in Oso
neska zera da 'She really is a [something] girl', in which the unexpressed
quality ('gorgeous', 'fiery', 'big', or whatever) must be inferred from the
context; this may be positive or negative. Finally, zer may be used in a simply enormous number of derivatives with more or less specific senses:
zeregi 'too fussy', zerena 'snoop, nosy parker', zerkeria 'hypocrisy', zerez
beterik 'furious' (roughly 'full of it'), and many others.
The pronoun norbera, from nor 'who' plus bera 'self, corresponds to the
impersonal 'one' in locutions like norbere herria 'one's own country'. Nor
'who' and the determiner zein 'which?' can also function as indefinite pronouns meaning 'each one' in locutions like the following. A genitive expression acts here as a variable linked to the pronoun:The noun phrase(129) Noribereadawho.DAT his/hers is159zuzenbidea.

(130) a. Zein bere bidetik

b. zein bere tokian

When repeated, zein means 'some...others', as in zein zabalago, zein meharrago 'some more widely, others more narrowly'. For the use of zein as a
relative pronoun, see section 4.10.3.
3.1.6.1.5. Reflexives
There are no true reflexive pronouns; instead, reflexive noun phrases are
formed by combining the genitive of an intensive personal pronoun with
buru 'head' and the definite article -a. Here are the forms:
Table 56. Reflexive noun phrases
neure burua
'myself
heure burua
'yourself (intimate)
bere burua

geure burua

zeuen burua
'yourselves'
zere(n) burua
'themselves'Some speakers add plural -k to the plural reflexives (geure buruak 'ourselves'); this was usual in the older language, but today it is less common
than the other form. Except when this -k is added, a reflexive is always formally non-plural and never triggers plural agreement in the verb:
(131) Ispiluan
ikusi dugu (*ditugu) geure
burua.
mirror.LOC see AUX
our.lNTS head
'We saw ourselves in the mirror.'
A reflexive noun phrase may never appear in subject position, but may
appear in any other position and take case-marking normally, except that it160Morphologymay not take the genitive case-ending. The ordinary intensive genitives like
neure are used instead.
Many western speakers use a different reflexive construction, in which
the transitive verb is construed intransitively and no reflexive NP is present:
Ispiluan ikusi naiz Ί saw myself in the mirror'. This second construction is
not possible with verbs of emotion, like maite *edun 'love', or with verbs
that have different meanings when used transitively and transitively, like hil
'die', 'kill' (see sections 4.1.2.9 and 4.9.2).","[184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190]"
"Laka (1990) accounts for the difference between unmarked and negated sentences transformationally, by making the auxiliary move to the left edge of
the sentence and adjoin to the negation head originating there. This linear
relation between the basic elements of the sentence has a structural correlate. Negation in Basque can be shown to be structurally higher than the
minimal sentential constituent (the minimal constituent containing both theNegation 519subject and the finite auxiliary). Laka adduces two pieces of evidence in favor of this structural position. The first piece of evidence is provided by the
fact that sentential negation in Basque licenses subject polarity items (unlike
in English, for instance). Under the assumption that this sort of licensing requires the licenser (negation) to be in a position higher than the polarity
item, or instead to be in a local relation of agreement, the facts show that
negation sits in a higher position than the case marked subject in cases such
as (1072):
(1072) a. Ez da
inor
not AUX anybody
'Nobody came.'
b. Ez du
inork
notAUXetorri.
come
erosi.anybody.ERGbuy'Nobody bought it.'
The other piece of evidence is based on the assumption that ellipsis targets
syntactic constituents. If so, the prediction is that ellipsis could affect the
minimal sentence constituent leaving negation intact, and that seems to be
the case:

Jon.ERGMirenikusi du,baina Perukez.","[548, 549]"
"4.4.7.2.1. Foci following negation

Jon. ERG signJONEK'JON did not sign the petition.'",[537]
"The bound particle ba- is also used to save finite verbs from clause initial
positions, when clauses are positive in meaning (N'Diaye 1970; Arejita
1988). In those cases the bound morpheme does not necessarily express (although it can) emphatic affirmation:
(1145) a.",[569]
"4.10.1.1.4. The negative complementizer -enik
The occurrence of this negative complementizer, restricted for most part to
the western and central (Bizkaian and Gipuzkoan) dialects, is triggered by
the presence of negation (overt or covert) in the main governing clause:

bizkartzain izan zirenik.
Rubio.GEN bodyguard be

As the reader can check, example (1471) is exactly the same as (1445)
except for the difference in complementizer; examples (1445) and (1471)
are worth noting in this regard because they are both taken from the same
newspaper article: while the writer chose the suffix -ela for the headline, she
or he chose the suffix -enik for the main body of the article. Nevertheless,
they seem for the most part to be equivalent; the former is valid in every
non-interrogative context, whereas the latter would be restricted to the domain of a governing negative verb.",[673]
"4.6.1.3. Relative clauses
Bare relative clauses not followed by a finite auxiliary or further predicative
element are used to express exclamatory force:
(1236) a. Nikigaro
nayuazan larriak

[Barbier, Supazter xokoan:59]Exclamatives 5694.6.1.4. Exclamative particles
Some particles serve the purpose of marking a clause (finite or not) as exclamative. One of them is ala, homonymous with the exclusive disjunction
ala 'or'. The presence of ala following a clause implies that the utterer takes
the state of affairs presented by that clause as highly improbable:
(1237) Erosi duzuala?
ala
'You really bought it? (I can't believe that you did)!'
buyAUXAla also occurs in what Lafitte calls 'pseudo-interrogatives', whose force,
despite the fact that they occur together with an interrogative word, is not
that of an interrogative (they don't seek any information) but rather a comment on the felicity of a previous utterance:
(1238) Zer
uste duzu, ergelak
garela
ala?
whatthinkAUX,stupid.DET.PLAUX.COMPala'What do you think, that we are stupid or what?'
In eastern dialects, ala can also be used in initial position as an exclamative
marker. If occurring in a clause containing a tensed verb, the latter bears the
complementizer bait-:
(1239) a. Andozeko
ibarra, ala ibar
luzea!
Andoz.REL valley ala valley long.DET
'the Andoze valley, what a long valley!' [Folk song]
b. Ala baita
doluegingarri amodioetan dena!
alaCOMP.is pitifullove.PL.LOCis.C0MP.DET'How pitiful is he who is in love!' [Folk song]
Another particle which gives rise to an exclamative utterance is gero 'after'.
When it occurs at the right end of a clause, it serves to strengthen the assertion conveyed by that clause:
(1240) Ederrak
nice.DET.PLdira gero, gereziondohoriek!arethoseaftercherry.tree'They are really nice, indeed, those cherry trees!'
Two sentential adverbs whose presence also implies an exclamation are jakina and noski, which can be translated as 'of course'. In this case, their ex-570 Syntaxclamatory force follows from the fact they are used to correct the strength of
a previous assertion:
(1241) Jakina/noski
of.coursegaraizheldukogarela!in.timearrive.FUTAUX.COMPOf course we will arrive in time!'
Finally, exclamatives can also be constructed by the addition of modal ahal
'can/may' plus the future suffix in the lexical verb. This kind of exclamative
expresses the desire of the utterer as to the eventual realization of the proposition involved:
(1242) a. Etorriko
come.FUTahal da!
mayAUX'May he come!'
b. Milla

[Kir. Abarrak]4.6.1.5. Other exclamatives with verbs
A corrective exclamative pattern which calls into question a previous statement to the contrary can be formed by a negative future verbal form where
the negative+auxiliary elements have not been preposed (4.5.2.1.2.1). While
absence of auxiliary preposing with negation is possible in a variety of embedded contexts, among matrix clauses it is mostly found in exclamatives:
(1243) Esangoezdut(ba)\say.FUTnotAUXthen'Of course I will say it!' Lit. 'Won't I say it!'
Surprise at the action indicated by the verb is often constructed by adding
the particle ere 'also' to the nominalized form of the verb:
(1244) Esatea
say.NOM.DETere!
also'How could he/she/you... even say it!'","[598, 599, 600]"
"4.4.7.2.2. Further differences and similarities between negative foci and
quasifoci
In this section we will examine whether the grammatical phenomena that
can affect foci in positive contexts may affect negative foci and quasifoci in
similar ways.
(a). Pied piping. This is available with foci in pre- and post-auxiliary positions:
(1036) BEHIN ERE ez zuela
jomugan jotzen
egin
once also not AUX.COMP target
hit.IMPF do
zuen amets.
AUX dream
'He dreamed that he did not hit the target EVEN ONCE.'
(1037) Jomugan ez zuela BEHIN ERE jotzen egin zuen amets.
(1038)(1039)ez duela
egin] uste du
not AUX.COMP do
think AUX
'Mikel thinks that it was not Jon that did it.'
[JONEK
Jon.ERGMikelek.
Mikel.ERG[Ez duela JONEK egin] uste du Mikelek.",[542]
"3.5.4.8. Potential
The potential mood includes three tenses: present, past and hypothetical potential. In analytical forms, the radical of the lexical verb is used, combined
with subjunctive auxiliaries containing always the modal suffix -ke: mintza
dakiguke 's/he can speak to us', ikas zezakeen 's/he could learn it', ikus
lezake 's/he would be able to see it'. In eastern dialects the auxiliary *iro is
available as a transitive auxiliary (usually without dative agreement). Most
of the time, the conjugated form of *iro doesn't include the modal suffix
-ke. In Bizkaian egin 'do' is used as an auxiliary instead of *ezan.
In older Basque, potential forms were always used along with ezin in
negative sentences and ahal in positive sentences. In present day Basque,
they are only optional. In any case, it should be remembered that there are
other ways to express the potential apart from these forms, since indicative
auxiliaries combined with ezin and ahal can also express potentiality (see
3.5.6.2): egin dezaket = egi(te)n ahal dut Ί can do it' ; ez(in) naiteke eror =
ez naiz erortzen ahal or ezin naiz erori (or ezin erortzen naiz) Ί cannot fall
down'.",[304]
