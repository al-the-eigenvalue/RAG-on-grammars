Questions and negation
This chapter takes as its starting point the semantic fields of questions and negation and
looks at the kinds of constructions used to express them. The expression of questions
and negation in Lavukaleve involves some use of focus constructions, as well as other
syntactic strategies not involving morphologically-marked focus.
Questions are expressed in one of two main ways: either by using a specific questionword, or by just using a focus construction. Even those clauses using specific question
words are frequently expressed using focus constructions.
There are various ways to negate different kinds of constituents: including the Negative
verbal suffix -la, the particle tamu ÔnoÕ; the intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ; the negative
imperative expressed by the Admonitive suffix; and other negative lexical items.
Frequently, negative predications are expressed using a focus construction. The use of
focus constructions in the areas of questions and negation is a very characteristic feature
of Lavukaleve, and indeed of other languages which have grammaticalised focus
structures.
The first part of this chapter discusses the syntactic structures used to express questions,
and also all the interrogative lexical items in the language. It also discusses how positive
and negative polar questions are answered. The second part of the chapter presents a
discussion of all aspects of negation, including the role of the focus markers in negative
clauses. The morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features of focus constructions are
discussed in Chapter 11.
17.1 QUESTIONS
In Lavukaleve, questions are very often phrased using a focus construction. There are
40717 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONalso a number of question words which may be used, either in a focus construction or
not. All questions are marked, not only by syntactic and lexical means, but also by a
distinctive rising intonation. Questions can be divided into two functional and syntactic
types: polar questions and content questions.
As was shown in Section 11.7, there are three focus markers in Lavukaleve: feo, the
default focus marker; meo, the focus marker used in polar questions; and heo, the focus
marker used, among other things, in content questions. See the above-mentioned
chapter for a full discussion of the focus markers and their syntactic and semantic
functions.
The sole use of the meo focus marker, then, is in marking focus in polar questions.
Content questions usually use a question word, usually with a focus marker. If the focus
marker is present, it is heo, and it agrees with the questioned item. The following
sections discuss in turn polar questions and then content questions.
17.1.1 P OLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions are framed using a focus construction involving the meo focus marker,
with the focus marker agreeing with the questioned element. Since questioned elements
are focussed, by definition, one would expect questions to be expressed using morphosyntactically marked focus in a language in which this is available, and this is indeed
what happens in Lavukaleve. Some examples (there are many more in Section 11.7):

Section 17.1.2 explains how the answers to these and other questions are phrased.
Note that the focus marker does not move to the initial position in questions; rather, it
remains in the position in which it would be if the sentence were not a question. There
are a couple of examples in which the focus marker appears in initial position. For
instance:
5)Minu

-sgmna
na
sgmArthin?
hin
3sgmEFOCWas it you (m) who was cruel to my mother, putting her there and leaving her and going?
gm 102This is not an example of movement of the focus marker, as there is no other place in
the sentence where the focus marker would be expected to be. Rather, it is an example
of ellipsis of the argument with which the focus marker is in construction; inu Ôyou
(2sg)Õ. This, and another sentence structurally almost identical to it from the same story,
is the only example of such ellipsis in the corpus. It is not clear whether the possibility
is to do with the fact that the sentence is a question.
Incidentally, this is also one of the rare examples of a focus-echo construction using the
meo focus marker. Note that the second (and third, in fact) focus markers agree in
gender and number but not person with the first. See Section 11.5.1 for an explanation
of focus-echo constructions.
17.1.2 A NSWERS TO POLAR QUESTIONSPolar questions can be phrased both positively and negatively, as the examples above
have shown. Positive answers to positive polar questions are expressed by iire ÔyesÕ.
Negative answers to positive questions are expressed by tamu ÔnoÕ. The particle comes
first, in its own sentence intonation unit, then a longer sentential answer may follow.
For example the answer to the question in (2) Is it here you want to stay? is as follows:
40917 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION
6)""Tamu.
tamu
noKanifa
kanifa
along.a.bitmail
mail
a.bitkoi"".
koi
also""No. A bit further again"".b1 030Questions phrased positively are neutral as to whether they expect a positive or negative
answer. However questions phrased negatively expect a positive answer. For example
the question in (4) above The giant here didnÕt eat you? was asked when a boy
reappeared in his village after a long absence. The village people had assumed he had
been eaten by the giant, but seeing him they realised he must not have been, and thus
asked the question knowing that it would receive a positive answer: the giant had not
eaten him. The boyÕs answer is as follows:
7)Tamu.
tamu
noNgaulam
nga- u -la
1sgO- eat -NEG-m
-sgmfin.
fin
3sgmFOCNo. He didn't eat me.mn2 058As the example shows, positive answers to negative questions are expressed with the
negative particle.
Even though negative questions expect a positive answer, it is possible to give a
negative answer to a negative question. This is done using a particle oman Ôon the
contraryÕ. A negative answer to the above question (Q: The giant didnÕt eat you? A:
The giant ate me (which would only make sense if the boy was now a ghost for
example)) could be expressed in the following way, using oman and a positive
sentence:
8)Oman.

shown in Section 11.7 that if a content question employs a focus construction, the focus
marker used will be the heo focus marker. The heo focus marker in questions works as
in focus constructions, but the element it is questioning is the element it expresses focus
on, using the agreement system outlined in Chapter 11.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436]"

diachronic analysis. Note that it is not possible to say *riahi hi. Note also that even if
riahi is a separate word, it is indistinguishable from the two-word sequence of ria hi

b1 01741517 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION17.2 NEGATION
There are a number of means by which a word or a clause can be negated. Verbs can be
negated using the verbal suffix -la, which usually, but not necessarily, involves a focus
construction. NPs can be negated using the adjective ro ÔoneÕ, with its negative suffix
-ru to mean Ônot oneÕ. Adjectives and whole propositions can be negated using the
intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ. An entire proposition or an NP can be negated using the
particle tamu ÔnotÕ. A negative command can be given, using the Admonitive verbal
suffix -n. In addition there are various lexical items which have a negative meaning.
The syntax and semantics of these methods of negation will be discussed. The method
of expressing not wanting, while not actually a syntactically negative construction,
nonetheless belongs in this semantic area, and is also discussed below.
17.2.1 THE VERBAL SUFFIX -LAThe verbal suffix -la (glossed NEG) is used to negate a verb. It co-occurs with little
other verbal morphology: only an object prefix if the verb is transitive, the Causative
suffix (which precedes it) and the Agreement Suffix (which follows it). Negative
expressions involving the negative suffix -la are almost always expressed in focus
constructions. This is a stylistic rather than obligatory syntactic matter, but nevertheless
it is unusual to see a negated verb not in a focus construction.
It was explained in Chapter 11 that all verbal predications, negated or otherwise, may
appear in a focus construction, with the type of focus being shown by means of which
core participant is indexed with the Agreement Suffix and the focus marker. In all
transitive non-negative predication types in which there is a focus marker immediately
following the verb, the speaker may choose whether the Agreement Suffix and focus
marker will agree with the subject or object of the verb; the choice depends on what
type of focus the speaker wishes to express; either sentence focus or predicate focus. In
negated clauses, however, there is no choice: the Agreement Suffix and focus marker
must obligatorily agree with the subject of the verb (in positive sentences this agreement
system would mark sentence focus).
Some examples will illustrate these points. The examples show a negated verb, with the
Agreement Suffix, followed by a focus marker, both agreeing with the subject of the
clause.

"41817 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATIONÔbe notÕ, and was discussed in Section 3.2.3. It is not a serial verb construction, because
the subject of a serial verb construction can be marked only once across the whole
predicate, not once on each verb as here. For the same reason it cannot be any other type
of complex predicate. Syntactically such sequences of verbs are considered to be two
independent clauses in succession. Such constructions only occur with verbs tave and
tuna; in all other cases, clauses in sequence must be overtly marked for their
relationship with each other, either as subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent
or coordinated independent clauses.
17.2.3 RO-RU ÔNOT ONEÕThe suffix -ru only appears on the adjective ro (cited here in its feminine singular
form). Ro means ÔoneÕ; ro-ru means Ônot oneÕ. The suffixed ro word is used to negate a
noun. It very frequently negates mina ÔthingÕ; thus mina roru ÔnothingÕ. A clause
containing an NP negated with ro-ru must appear with a further clausal negator. Thus,
if the clause is verbal, the verb must be negated using verbal suffix -la. If the clause is
non-verbal, it must be negated with the negative particle tamu ÔnotÕ.

17.2.4 TAMU ÔNOTÕThe particle tamu negates an entire clause or an NP. It appears postposed to a positive
clause and negates the proposition of that clause, or, as discussed above, it provides an
answer to a negative question. The difference between using a tamu construction and
using the verbal suffix -la or tave Ôbe notÕ, which have the same propositional effect,

Discourse organisation
Most of the previous chapters have dealt with the structures and functions of sentences
and their component parts. This chapter aims to show some aspects of how these
sentences, once built, are actually used in Lavukaleve. The chapter is in two separate
parts. The first part examines how sentences are joined together in discourse, looking at
typical Lavukaleve ways of structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion. The
kinds of methods to be discussed are not grammaticalised structures, but rather, common
and idiomatic ways of choosing to structure a discourse, and as such are an important part
of how the language works. The second part discusses reference tracking. Other parts of
the description have shown what linguistic material is available in Lavukaleve to introduce
and track referents in narratives. This section shows how these different types of
linguistic material interact, and how they are used across a narrative, rather than just
across a sentence. It also shows that very often participant tracking is not a priority, and
instead there frequently exists a high degree of ambiguity about the identity of referents.
18.1 W AYS OF JOINING SENTENCES INTO LARGER UNITS
There are three main ways by which sentences are joined into larger discourse units in
Lavukaleve. Very commonly, head/tail linkage is used, in which the final verb of one
sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence (Section 18.1.1). Also very
common is the use of Ôdiscourse-linkage verbsÕ, a strategy in which generic verbs such as
ÔdoÕ are used to link a sentence to the previous one (Section 18.1.2). Thirdly,
conjunctions can be used to link sentences together in a temporal or causal sequence
(Section 18.1.3).","[444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449]"

ns 113NEGATION OF VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION TYPESThe negative suffix cannot co-occur with any TAM suffixes, or with verbal morphology
marking subordinate clauses, the Non-Finite, Completive or Successive suffixes on
clause chaining verbs, the Nominalisers, the Locativiser, the Extended or the Reciprocal
suffixes (these are discussed in Chapters 12, 13, 15 and 16).
These restrictions mean that the verbs of many construction types cannot be negated
directly. Instead, multi-verb constructions are used, such that verbal morphology
appears on a different verb from that which the Negative suffix appears on.
Alternatively, other kinds of negation apart from the Negative suffix can be used.
For example, the following construction type is commonly used for future negation. The
lexical verb carries the Negative suffix, and the Habitual Auxiliary carries the Future
Tense suffix:41717 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION

emk 017NON-VERBAL CLAUSESNon-verbal clauses function in this respect similarly to verbal clauses. The focus marker
in non-verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions can in theory agree with either of the
two NPs that may be present, although in practice it is very difficult to find an example
showing the focus marker agreeing with one NP but not the other, because the
complement in almost all cases is the item of equation or identification with the subject,
and thus they both have the same agreement properties. Therefore, sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished in two-NP non-verbal clauses, but in practice often the
difference cannot be seen. There are some examples however which are clear:

construction and use a verb with a negative meaning in the focus marker clause (thus, not
using a non-verbal clause) (e.g. 40), or use a non-verbal clause with the negative particle
tamu ÔNEGÕ, but no focus marker (e.g. 41). The focus marker does not normally cooccur with the negative particle.

co2 044SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONThere is, then, a Sentence-Final focus construction in Lavukaleve which allows two
different focus structures. These focus structures are signalled by agreement of the focus
marker. It is not simply the case that the focus marker agrees with what it is focussing on,
but rather it works by signalling the extent of the focus through the sentence. The
appearance of the focus marker signals that focus is an issue in the sentence. The
agreement which the focus marker displays tells the hearer what the domain of the focus
is. Thus, Lavukaleve marks the distinction between these two types of focus
grammatically.
In predicate focus, agreement extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to
the object argument, which occurs before the verb. Basic constituent order in Lavukaleve
is S(O)V. In sentence focus, agreement extends throughout the entire sentence from the
focus marker at the end through to the first element of the sentence, the subject. Ellipsed
NPs do not matter for the scope of focus; the focus construction utilises obligatory verbal
and focus marker morphology to express scope, and it does not in fact matter whether or
not the actual NP arguments are there for the scope to obtain. It is not clear to what extent
adjuncts are included in Sentence-Final focus constructions.
Predicate focus is the most common, unmarked focus type in Lavukaleve. This is what
one would expect from LambrechtÕs definition. A focussed predicate is what would in
26411 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSother terms have been called the comment of a topic-comment structure: Òwhen the focus
is marked on the object ... this is a grammatical signal that the unmarked relation between
presupposition and assertion obtainsÓ (Lambrecht 1987: 374). In Lavukaleve, SentenceFinal focus constructions in which the focus marker agrees with the object are predicate
focus constructions. They are the unmarked Sentence-Final focus construction type; both
in pragmatic terms and in terms of distribution.
Sentence focus is a pragmatically (and distributionally) very highly marked focus
construction. In Lavukaleve it is used for situations involving very strong, often
contrastive focus. All negative Sentence-Final focus constructions take this form too.
Lambrecht points out that sentence-focus constructions are usually used for presentational
sentences involving all-new information. ÔPresentationalÕ, refers to structures that Òare
used to introduce an NP referent, or the concept associated with some NP, into the
universe of discourseÓ (1987: 375). Such sentences have also been referred to as thetic
(e.g. Lambrecht 1987. Note though, that Sasse (1987) expresses unease at such a
correlation of thetic utterances with sentences involving focus on the entire statement.)
For Lambrecht, Ò[Sentence focus] structures express propositions in which the assertion
extends over the entire proposition, they exhibit a certain Òall-newÓ character which
distinguishes them from [predicate focus] structuresÓ (1987: 379). This all-newness of
presentational, sentence focus structures also, in many languages, becomes associated
with situations involving unexpected or surprising information: ÒThe less the cognitive
status of the NP referent warrants the use of the [sentence focus] structure, the more the
construction will give rise to the implicature that the piece of information expressed in the
[sentence focus] structure is of special importanceÓ (1987: 379). These types of pragmatic
functions are indeed present in Lavukaleve sentence-focus constructions.
It is possible, and indeed common, in Lavukaleve to express focus on a particular
argument. In this case, the focus marker is still involved, but instead of a Sentence-Final
focus construction, a Sentence-Internal focus construction must be used. The next section
describes these.
11.3.3 SENTENCE-INTERNAL FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSIn Sentence-Internal focus constructions the focus marker is in construction with a nonpredicating constituent. That is, the focus marker follows it and, if applicable, agrees in
person/gender/number with it. The non-predicating constituents can be arguments or
adjuncts. I follow Lambrecht in using the term Ôargument focusÕ to label this focus type.
It will be shown below that the same construction type that serves to convey focus on an
argument or an adjunct can also be used to convey focus on a non-main verb or the first26511 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSpart of a complex predicate6 .
This argument focus construction type is similar to what is commonly referred to as
narrow focus, as opposed to the wide focus of the sentence focus and predicate focus
constructions discussed above.
If the focussed constituent is an NP, the focus marker agrees in person, gender and
number with it. If the focussed constituent is not an NP, the focus marker receives default
agreement, that is, it appears in its 3rd person singular neuter form.
It is easiest to see argument focus operating with NP arguments. The following examples
compare Sentence-Internal focus sentences with their non-focus marked counterparts. The
minimal/near-minimal pairs are elicited; they are useful to make the structures immediately
apparent. Textual examples will be discussed after this.
The first two examples are near-minimal pairs, the first has no grammatically marked
argument focus, the second has argument focus shown by the focus marker after the
object:

e3 010eThe next three examples show the difference between a focussed NP and a non-focussed
NP. Many of the examples to follow actually contain two focus markers in one sentence.
This is an extremely common construction type in Lavukaleve. This type of sentence, the
focus-echo construction, is discussed in more detail in Section 11.5.1 below. The second
focus marker must always be the heo focus marker, and it must always agree with the
first focus marker. At this point, only the first, italicised focus markers are relevant.
Example (44) is a basic Sentence-Final focus construction, showing predicate focus (see
above). (45) and (46) show argument focus; (45) (repeated from 13) has a focussed
object, (46) a focussed subject. The second shows focus on the fish, and the third on the
woman.","[289, 290, 291, 292]"

My primary debt is to the many Lavukaleve speakers who made the effort to talk to me
and teach me their language. IÕm only sorry I was such a slow learner. It was the people
of the West Russells, and Mane Village in particular, who made this work possible, by
letting me live with them and making the effort to talk with me, even though I was clearly
a freak and possibly dangerous. Especially important were Chief Nicholas Sobo, his wife
Fane Navo, and two of their daughters, Marion Kuu and Nesta Kelavi. Fane Novo
overcame her shyness to be one of my few monolingual teachers. Marion and Nesta often
fed me, particularly in the beginning, and Marion kept me company for the first few
months when everyone else was too afraid to talk to me. My neighbours Emily Mavaua
and Colin Pawa also kept an eye on me, and the kids, especially Maureen and her gang of
little girls were brilliant teachers.
But my biggest helpers were Patterson Barua, and his wife Monica Felakoe Elufua, and
daughter Christa Kanefa. Patterson in particular taught me almost everything I know
about Lavukaleve, and everything I know about doing linguistics in the field. Monica fed
me and looked after me and made sure I was never in want of anything she could provide,
and Christa carried buckets of water. In a village with no water supply, this is no small
favour.
Also the people of Baesen, my other home, deserve my thanks, in particular the former
headmaster of Flahaba School, Stanley Sade, and also Chief Clement Savaka, Nancy,
Emily Fofokolin and Dora Iho and her husband, and their mother Salome Vavara, who
welcomed me into their homes when I first arrived in the Russells. Their warmth and
friendliness helped me through many a hard day. Also the people of Losiolen, Hae,
Louna, Alokan and particularly Karumulun who talked to me, especially Chief Raymond
Kolo, Julian Beglin, Janet Tokilo and Hilda Bungu. Also my other family in Yandina,
Ben Rabe and Hannah Kuatavea, and in Honiara, Anne Sade and her family. I am
particularly grateful to Hannah for looking after me whenever I was waiting in Yandina
for transport, which happened a lot, and to Ben for letting me make free with his canoe.
And of course, thank you to Michael Boliko, and also Addeson and Niko for driving me
round in BenÕs canoe any time I wanted, providing me with much interesting
entertainment on the way.
vAlso thank you to the people who told me the stories which provided the data for this
thesis. It is trite to say that without these people there would have been no thesis, but
nevertheless, each one of them made the effort to tell a story to the foreigner with the
machine, and this is gratefully acknowledged. Those who havenÕt already been mentioned
are: Abel Moran, Ann Onutu, Christian Hill, Clement Oiva, Edward Getu, Ethel Mary
Kanefa, Frank Koau, Georgina Makikifaria, Honiara Resman, James Nepolo, John
Hubert, John Nate, Kilaev Gulum, Matthew Ngele, Donald Ofiva, Melchior Pitu, Mase
Toto, Laurence Soitam, Sarah Kiko, Edwin Vefele, Wilson Ngara, William Fox, and
especially Mostin Nekuiga, whose willingness to tell stories about giants was exceeded
only by my willingness to record them.
Certain other people who were in Honiara at one time or another also receive my thanks,
including Evizel Seymour, Rachael Gooberman, and Matthew Bowden, variously for
either putting me up, or putting up with me, or both.
And back in Canberra, thanks to my friends, specially Catriona Hyslop, Bethwyn Evans,
Eva Lindstršm, Kazuko Obata, Tony Liddicoat, and Tim Curnow. During the last six
months, the PhD students at MPI Nijmegen entertained me and eased me into a new
culture, and they include Anna Margetts, Birgit Hellwig and Mandana Seyfeddinipur.
Back in Canberra again, thanks to my mother Pamela and my brother Simon, who both
visited me in the field, and made me see again with new eyes things that I had already
become used to. Thanks also to my mother for never-ending support of every possible
kind. Thanks to my brother Greg too, a prime example of how to never let a PhD get in
the way of having a good time. And huge thanks go to my best friend Michael Dunn, who
is always equally happy to read a chapter or give me a belay, and just as patient at both.
Making an appearance at the beginning of the project was Mark Donohue, who made a
major tactical error when he cut out pages 816-819 of the copy he gave me of Todd
(1975) in the hope that I wouldnÕt notice how interesting Lavukaleve looked. I noticed.
Evelyn Todd herself was a very important figure in the beginning, generously sharing her
Lavukaleve data with me before I had been to the Russells.
I would also like to thank my supervisors: in the Department of Linguistics, in the
Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, where I was based, was my main
supervisor Malcolm Ross, who can spot an Austronesian loan from 50 metres; as well as
Andy Pawley (all faults of style in this work are despite his best efforts); and Darrell
Tryon, who initially made me welcome in RSPAS. Sasha Aikhenvald from the Research
Centre for Linguistic Typology could always be relied on for boundless enthusiasm. Tim
Curnow again, also from the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology, made a stylish
last-minute appearance of inestimable value. In this paragraph also belong my thanks to
Nikolaus Himmelmann, who was never my supervisor, but who nevertheless did an
awful lot of supervising.
viThanks also to Gerrit Dimmendaal, David Wilkins and Bill McGregor for reading and
commenting on chapters. Also I would like to thank the Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, who provided a working environment
during the last six months of my PhD. I suspect I got a far better deal than they did from
my presence here.
There are also lots of people who are or were based in the Linguistics Department in the
Faculty of Arts at the ANU, who helped make me the kind of linguist I have become.
Whether or not theyÕd be happy with the result so far I donÕt know, but Bob Dixon,
Harold Koch, Ulrike Mosel and Anna Wierzbicka were the ones who initially gave me the
inspiration. Mind you, Ulrike said it would not be possible to write a grammar of this
language without speakers living in Canberra. Up until almost the last minute, I
completely agreed with her.viiviiiAbstract
The thesis is in five major parts. The first part, Preliminaries, deals with the basic
building blocks on which the grammar is founded; the introductory chapter, the
phonology and the word classes.
The second part of the thesis deals with arguments and adjuncts. Chapter 4 outlines Noun
Phrase structure and the structure of possessive constructions. Chapter 5 and 6 deal with
issues inherent to individual nouns; noun formation in Chapter 5 and gender and
agreement in Chapter 6. The morphological processes of noun formation are extremely
complex; for example there are at least 86 different ways of forming dual and plural
nouns. Chapter 7 discusses nominal adjuncts. Chapter 8 deals with the complex area of
deictics, one of the most structurally elaborated areas of the language. There are three
paradigms of demonstratives. One is a demonstrative modifier, and two are demonstrative
pronouns, which differ in their pragmatic reference; one is used to refer to an entity not
uppermost in the minds of the speaker and hearers, and the other is used elsewhere. The
relationship between the three demonstrative paradigms is complex and interesting, and is
dealt with in some detail. Presentative forms can be created from most of the deictics, as
can predicative deictics, by means of additional morphology.
The third part of the thesis concerns predicate structure. Basic clause structure and
principles of participant marking are outlined in Chapter 9. Constructions using the
Agreement Suffix are examined in Chapter 10. The Agreement Suffix, one of the
morphological means of marking participants, is a ubiquitous and important suffix in the
language. Focus constructions, discussed in Chapter 11, are another very elaborated area
of Lavukaleve morphosyntax. There are three paradigms of focus markers in Lavukaleve.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate, a sentence, an NP or an
adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles and non-main verbs. When
predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence. The agreement of the focus marker (with the person, gender and number of
either the subject or the object of the clause) shows the domain of focus. When arguments
and adjuncts are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,
ixsentence-internally.
Chapter 12 deals with the expression of tense, aspect and mood. Chapter 13 deals with
valency changing, the creation of predicates from words of other classes, as well as other
word class-changing morphological processes. The final chapter of this part, Chapter 14,
outlines the types of complex predicates existing in the language, including serial verb
constructions, verb compounds, verb-adjunct constructions, and predicates involving the
Habitual Auxiliary.
The fourth part of the thesis deals with interclausal syntax: clause chaining constructions
(Chapter 15) and subordinate clauses (Chapter 16). There are three types of subordinate
clauses; one of them, subordinate adverbial clauses, involves a split-ergative marking
system. Most other areas of the language have nominative/accusative alignment. The final
part of the thesis, discourse organisation, aims to bring together some of the broader areas
of importance to Lavukaleve discourse. The expression of questions and negation is
described in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18 is a discussion of typical Lavukaleve ways of
structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion, and an examination of how
reference tracking devices operate across a larger section of narrative than a single
sentence.
An appendix containing two glossed texts forms the final part of this thesis.xContents

3plFOCThat's why people know their clan and they know their tribe.jh 043Examples like the sentence above bring up one important issue. It was said earlier that
sentence focus is focus over an entire sentence, from the first element, the subject NP,
through to the verb. But often adjuncts come before the subject NP in a sentence, and in
this case it is not completely clear whether the focus extends over them, as part of the
sentence, or whether the focus starts at the subject. The analysis offered here, that focus
marker agreement indicates scope, suggests that adjuncts before the subject do not form
part of the scope of focus, and that the focus does indeed only start at the subject. It does
suggest however that adjuncts between the subject and the verb are within the scope of
focus. This is a very difficult matter to test, and it needs to be investigated more
thoroughly.
Note that sentence focus is pragmatically marked. This means that such sentences are
heard in texts, but out of context sentences in elicitation are usually rejected by speakers:

3sgfO- see -sgm 3sgmFOCe3 021b/2Sentence focus is incompatible with out-of-context elicited examples because it is so
pragmatically marked; it exists to express particular pragmatic meanings, which in general
do not come up in non-contextualised speech. In out-of-context sentences a more marked
focus construction is unexpected, and therefore difficult to interpret, and thus speakers
usually assume such a construction is a mistake in focus marker/verb agreement.
The next four examples are negative Sentence-Final focus constructions, in which the
focus marker always shows subject agreement (i.e. sentence focus) in Lavukaleve. This
represents a grammaticalisation of the pragmatic functions of the focus marker in negative
constructions. In negative focussed sentences, the focus marker is no longer signalling a
pragmatic choice of focus marking; instead the focus marker has become obligatory, and
the pragmatic function is lost:

object with a negative Sentence-Final focus construction. For example, (30) above, The
man didnÕt see the woman, using subject agreement, would also be used as the way to
express It was the woman that the man didnÕt see. That is, there is no grammatical
construction for expressing focus on an object in a negative sentence focus construction.
Similarly, there is no grammatical construction for expressing focus on a subject in a
negative sentence focus construction (It was the man who didnÕt see the woman).
So far the discussion has been confined to focus constructions with transitive sentences.
It has been shown that object agreement in Sentence-Final focus constructions correlates
with predicate focus, and subject agreement in Sentence-Final focus constructions
correlates with sentence focus. Intransitive and single-NP non-verbal sentence-final focus
constructions have more limited agreement possibilities, and thus it is impossible to make
so many distinctions in them.
INTRANSITIVE CLAUSESIntransitive clause constructions always show agreement with the subject. Thus, in the
terms in which transitive clauses have been analysed, intransitive Sentence-Final focus
constructions all show sentence focus. It is not possible for such sentences to show
predicate focus, as there is no object NP for the focus marker to agree with. Some
examples:26211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS

unique syntactic properties. For example, Durative-marked verbs are frequently
repeated, as shown above. Under the analysis assumed here, each Durative-marked verb
(and its arguments and adjuncts) forms an independent clause; repeated verbs form
strings of coordinated independent clauses.
However the fact that some Durative-marked verbs are extremely common, for instance
sianun Ôdo-DURÕ, feunun Ôgo up-DURÕ, vaunun Ôgo out-DURÕ suggests another
analysis. Such verbs tend to be repeated at least a couple of times, and they very rarely
have any overt arguments or adjuncts. They could perhaps be considered as lexicalised
verbal adjuncts; that is, verbal adjuncts derived from verbs with the Durative suffix.
This analysis is only possible for some instances of Durative-marked verbs. It cannot
account for their use when they have overt arguments or adjuncts, or when they have
the Non-Finite suffix. On the contrary, in these uses the Durative-marked verbs clearly
form independent clauses.
Verbs containing morphology of the other marked aspect, Imperfective aspect, do not
get repeated like Durative-marked verbs, and there is no evidence to show that they are
anything other than the verbs of independent clauses.
12.4 MOOD
There are six morphologically marked categories of mood in Lavukaleve: Admonitive
-n; Punctual Imperative -va~-ila~-iva; Durative Imperative -ma~-mela~-ba; Hortative
-me; Abilitative -nen~-nan; and Extended -la.
Mood is not an obligatory category in contexts in which it is semantically appropriate;
and the presence of Mood marking is incompatible with much other verbal morphology.
The verbs on which these mood suffixes occur cannot mark any categories of Tense,
Aspect or other Moods. Neither can they be negated; and because they cannot have the
Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10) they cannot occur in most types of focus
constructions (see Chapter 11) or relative clauses (see Section 16.3). All Mood-marked
verbs can, if transitive, appear with an object cross-referencing prefix, but some (the
Imperatives, the Hortative and the Extended) cannot occur with subject cross30612 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODreferencing prefixes. The Admonitive and Abilitative can cross-reference their subjects
with prefixes.
Other clause types expressing mood-like categories include Purposive and Potential
clauses. These categories are marked by suffixes on verbs, but, unlike the Mood
suffixes, verbs with such suffixes form subordinate clauses. These are discussed in
Chapter 16.
12.4.1 THE ADMONITIVEThere is a cluster of related meanings associated with the Admonitive suffix -n. The
core meaning, in terms of frequency at least, is the one which the suffix has been named
for: it is used to warn against something, telling the hearer to avoid something bad
happening. It sometimes contains an implied command to not do something. The suffix
is also used for a negative imperative; telling the hearer not to do something, with no
implication of avoiding anything bad that might follow from ignoring the command.
The suffix is also used to indicate that something bad might happen, without any
implied command to avoid it, or not do something. This is a deleterious possibility
usage (in the words of Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994: 211)). The suffix can, more
rarely, be used as an irrealis marker; to mean that something may happen, whether good
or bad, again with no implication that the speaker should do or not do anything to avoid
it. Lastly, the suffix may be used as an exhortative, asking that something, usually good,
should happen. This use is restricted to prayer.
These meanings, for the sake of clarity, can be schematised as follows:
· DonÕt! (negative imperative)
(No implication of trying to avoid something bad)
· Avoid something bad! (admonitive)
(Warning, sometimes an implied negative imperative)
· Something bad might happen! (deleterious possibility)
(Pointing it out, with no implication of commanding the hearer to avoid it)
· Something might happen! (irrealis)
(No indication of whether the something is good or bad, and no implication that the
hearer should avoid it)
· May something happen! (exhortative)
(Asking that something, usually good, may happen. Used in prayer.)
This is a large semantic range for one morpheme, but one can clearly see the semantic30712 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODconnections between each of the meanings. The final use, the exhortative, is perhaps
surprising given the first few meanings; but it can be understood it in terms of a slight
alteration of the irrealis meaning of Ôsomething might happenÕ to wanting something to
happen.
Bybee et al. (1994: 211) talk of an admonitive modality, which involves the speaker
issuing a warning to the addressee. They mention Alyawarra and Slave as two
languages in which a deleterious possibility marker is the same as an admonitive
marker. This is certainly the situation in Lavukaleve. Clearly at some level these
meanings are all closely related.
The following examples show the meanings of the suffix -n more clearly. Note that for
the sake of consistency, this suffix is universally glossed ADMONitive, irrespective of
its actual meaning in the context.
NEGATIVE IMPERATIVEThe negative imperative use of the suffix commands the hearer not to carry out the
action of the verb. There is no necessary implication that bad results will follow if the
hearer ignores the command. The admonitive in the negative imperative meaning is
often accompanied by sevo, a particle meaning Ôtabu/holyÕ, which can also be used by
itself to tell someone to stop doing whatever it is they are doing.

pr 00712.4.2 THE IMPERATIVESThere are two Imperative paradigms, each one with three members, marked for number
(singular, dual and plural). These Imperatives have 2nd person reference. Similar
command-type morphology for 1st inclusive reference is the Hortative -me (discussed
below, Section 12.4.3). Note also the 3rd singular exhortative form, one of the uses of
the Admonitive suffix -n (discussed above, Section 12.4.1), which also falls into a
similar semantic area. The Imperative forms discussed in this section are all positive;
the negative imperative is expressed by the Admonitive suffix -n (see above, Section
12.4.1).
The Imperatives can co-occur with subject prefixes, rarely, and they can have overt NPs
expressing the subject (usually inu Ô2nd singularÕ). But usually, as the examples show,
there is no overt mention of the subject, as its reference is assumed.
The two Imperatives differ in their meanings. The Punctual Imperative (glossed
PCTIMP) is so-named because it is used with verbs whose action can be carried out to
completion instantaneously. The Durative Imperative (glossed DURIMP) is used on the
type of verbs that would be expected to take some time to carry out to completion. This
31012 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODDurative Imperative is also used as the command form for verbs which have no
necessary endpoint. The addressee is expected to begin, but not complete, the action
instantly. The forms of the Imperatives are:SG
DU
PLPUNCTUAL IMPERATIVE
-va
-ila
-ivaDURATIVE IMPERATIVE
-ma
-mela
-baSG
DU
PLBecause of the aspectual nature of the difference between these, some verbs are usually
found only with Punctual Imperatives, and some only with Durative Imperatives.
However, for many verbs there is a certain overlap; either Imperative can be used, with
difference illocutionary force resulting from the choice.
For example, ngoa ÔstayÕ usually only takes the Durative Imperative:
47)Ngoama!

3.17.2 QUESTION PARTICLESQuestion particles include the following: ria~dia Ôwhere?Õ; riahi~diahi Ôwhere to?Õ (the
r-initial and d-initial forms vary freely; see Section 2.10); ninam Ôwhen?Õ; and vala
Ôhow, what, why?Õ, a general interrogative. These particles all occur as the first word of
a question sentence.
Other question words are intransitive verbs vasia Ôbe where?Õ and ela Ôbe how many?Õ;
masculine nouns ami Ôwho?Õ; man Ôwhat?Õ; elahave Ôhow much?Õ; and the plural noun
elav Ôhow many?Õ. Question particles and other question words are discussed in Section
17.1.
3.17.3 TIME PARTICLESThere are three time particles. They are: kosora ÔtodayÕ; raine ÔtomorrowÕ; marigen
ÔyesterdayÕ. Note also there is a word movele Ôthe day after tomorrowÕ, which is a
neuter noun. There is no word for Ôthe day before yesterdayÕ.
3.17.4 QUANTIFIER PARTICLESThere are only two quantifier particles; suni ÔallÕ and mail Ôa bitÕ. Other concepts from
this semantic area are expressed by words of other word classes, e.g. vutia Ôbe manyÕ
(intransitive verb); ro-ru ÔnoneÕ (adjective ro ÔoneÕ with negative suffix); fatu ÔhalfÕ
(noun); viluril ÔmostÕ (derived verb); and fan ÔsomeÕ (noun). They function as adjuncts
of verbs.
3.17.5 V OCATIVE PARTICLESThere are three vocative particles, which appear at the end of sentences, and provide
illocutionary force to the utterance. Typically they occur with commands and
exhortations. The three particles are na (vocative, singular), nail (vocative, dual) and
nai (vocative, plural). The particles are always spoken as the final word of an utterance,
after an intonation break (indicated below by the slash and comma respectively in the
following examples), and they always receive very strong stress. Their use is only
possible in very informal circumstances. Note that I have translated them as ÔyouÕ,
which, in this context, seems like the closest functional equivalent in English. They do
not, however, make any reference to person, and are not to be understood as pronouns
of any sort. Some examples:
16)E!

14.1.3 S HARING ARGUMENTS AND ADJUNCTSAll members of serial verb constructions share their subject arguments. If more than one
member is transitive, they also share their object arguments. Examples of all four
transitivity combinations (transitive-intransitive, intransitive-intransitive, intransitivetransitive and transitive-transitive) were shown above (examples (1), (2), (3) and (4)).
As has been evident from some of the above examples, subjects and objects differ in the
ways in which they are cross-referenced in serial verb constructions. A subject
argument can only be cross-referenced once per predicate (although it does not have to
be cross-referenced at all), on the last verb of the predicate, whereas an object argument
must be cross-referenced on every transitive verb of the predicate. This is because of the
principle of cross-referencing in Lavukaleve that every transitive verb must crossreference its object argument (see Section 9.7). However, even though each transitive
member of a serial verb construction must have its own object cross-reference, the
cross-referencing material all refers to the same argument. It is not the case that each
transitive verb of a serial verb construction chooses its own object argument, but rather
there is a morphological constraint that each transitive verb must be indexed for an
object argument. See below (Section 14.2 on verb compounds) where there is,
unproductively, a lifting of this constraint.
The fact that only transitive verbs receive object cross-referencing in a serial verb
construction shows that intransitive verbs do not share the object arguments of the
transitive verbs. Rather, only transitive verbs share their object arguments in a serial
verb construction, but all verbs share their subject arguments.
Unlike object cross-referencing, subject cross-referencing is not obligatory; and in some
constructions its presence may be proscribed. The examples of coordinate-dependent
constructions above illustrate this proscription. The next two examples show shared
subjects cross-referenced once, on the final verb of the predicate. The cross-referencing
may be of any kind allowed by simple predicates; that is either a prefix or the
Agreement Suffix.

v1 02114.1.4 S HARING MORPHOLOGYIt has been shown above that subject cross-referencing is shared among members of a
serial verb construction, while object cross-referencing is not shared, but must be
marked on each transitive verb of a serial verb construction. The Causative suffix
appears on an individual verb, and has scope only over that verb. This can be seen in
example (20) below. All other verbal morphology, including TAM, negation, and
subordinate adverbial clause-marking suffixes, is marked once only in the serial verb
construction, on the final verb, and has scope over the whole predicate. Examples of the
Non-Finite, Imperative and Completive suffixes only occurring on the last member of
the serial verb construction have occurred above (see (1), (3), (4), (6)). Examples of
other sorts of morphology follow:34314 - COMPLEX P REDICATESNegation:

cs2 032The different position of the Negative suffix in serial verb constructions with lei is a
morpho-lexical phenomenon, which does not have any implications about the scope of
negation. The Negative suffix, even though it appears on the first verb, has scope over
both verbs.
The scope of morphology in serial verb constructions is not negotiable: in all serial verb
constructions without lei ÔexistÕ, non-participant marking verbal morphology appears on
the final verb and obligatorily has scope over the whole serial verb construction. It is
only with serial verb constructions with lei as the second member that the Negative
suffix appears on the first not the last verb, and is not possible for the Negative suffix to
appear on the last, lei verb. Note that the Negative suffix is the only non-participant
verbal morphology found on serial verb constructions with lei in the corpus. It is not
known whether other non-participant verbal morphology would appear on the first or
last verb of serial verb constructions with lei.

involve one of the following motion verbs:
foa Ôgo downÕ
feu Ôgo up, go inlandÕ
ae Ôgo up, climbÕ
hau Ôgo ashoreÕ
vau Ôgo seawards, go outÕ
ve ÔgoÕ
vo ÔcomeÕ
Also occurring less commonly are other motion verbs sou ÔriseÕ, oio ÔsurroundÕ, fongo
ÔreachÕ, huru Ôgo insideÕ; aspectual verbs lei ÔexistÕ, lo ÔfinishÕ, and also lai ÔpaddleÕ, i
ÔdoÕ and sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ. These verbs provide directional, aspectual or
manner specification for the other verb in the serial verb construction.
The transitive verbs which take part in serial verb constructions are much more diverse
semantically, even though actual occurrence of transitive verbs in serial verb
constructions is far less frequent. Some of the more commonly occurring transitive
verbs include the following:34514 - COMPLEX P REDICATESma ÔtakeÕ
ke ÔdropÕ
li ÔbuildÕ
fei ÔscrapeÕ
fou ÔmakeÕ
lufu ÔleaveÕ
tuguri ÔchangeÕ
vala ÔpullÕ
sive ÔfollowÕ
ko ÔthrowÕ
The verbs which may occur in serial verb constructions are not restricted, and can be
any verb of the language.
With respect to the order of different verb types in serial verb constructions, a motion
verb usually, but not always, precedes the other verb; which may be another motion
verb, or may be a verb of a different semantic type. The verbs lei ÔexistÕ, lo ÔfinishÕ, i
ÔdoÕ and sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ are always the second verb of the serial verb
construction in which they occur. Note however the following example, in which lo
occurs both as the first and second verb of a serial verb construction:

verb constructions. DurieÕs (1997) account of serialising languages divides languages
into four types, under two parameters. The parameters are whether the verbs of the verb
sequence are contiguous, and whether they are incorporating: that is, whether the
components form a single morphological word. This account clarifies the relationship
between serial verb constructions and verb compounds. In Lavukaleve, serial verb
constructions are non-contiguous (see above, where it was shown that NPs and adjuncts
can intervene between verbs of a serial verb construction) and non-incorporating (the
verbs do not form a single phonological or morphological word). LavukaleveÕs verb
compounds (to be discussed below, Section 14.2) are, however, both contiguous and
incorporating; the verbs involved do form a single morphological and phonological
word.","[367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"
"27911 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS11.6 FURTHER DISCUSSION
11.6.1 NO MARKED FOCUSNot all Lavukaleve sentences have marked focus; in fact only about a third do. Under
LambrechtÕs analysis, all sentences convey information; they all have information
structure, and thus they all have focus. This is certainly true for Lavukaleve, as for all
languages. The above analysis has suggested that are two types of sentences in
Lavukaleve: those with grammatical focus constructions, and those without. By this,
however, it should not be understood that those sentences which do not employ a focus
construction do not have focus. Rather, in those sentences which do not employ focus
constructions, speakers are still conveying information about something; they are still
dividing their speech into presupposition and assertion; but they are not making this
distinction grammatically overt in the way a focus construction does. In other languages
with grammatically marked focus systems, for example Somali (Saeed 1984), the focus
system is likewise not used in every single sentence of the language.
If one thinks for a moment of focus constructions like LavukaleveÕs, or SomaliÕs, as
operating in a broadly similar functional domain as, for example, cleft constructions in
English (although LavukaleveÕs focus system and English clefts are very different types
of phenomena; see next section), then one can more easily understand why they are not
used for every sentence. In English, every sentence has information structure, but only
some have cleft constructions to make overt this information structure. In Lavukaleve, an
equivalent situation obtains, although the proportion of sentences with focus
constructions is far higher, corresponding to their considerably wider syntactic
possibilities, than clefts in English.
11.6.2 DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FOCUS MARKERS AND COPULASSentence-Internal focus constructions share many similarities with cleft constructions in
other languages. Functionally, they often serve to express the same kinds of pragmatic
meanings as cleft constructions with copulas do in languages that have them (see e.g.
Stenson (1981) on Irish). They serve to mark focus on a particular argument, and,
especially when the Sentence-Internal focus marker occurs in construction with a
constituent at the start of the sentence, one could interpret the Sentence-Internal focus
constituent as a copula clause, at the front of, and in construction with, the main clause.
However Lavukaleve focus markers cannot be analysed as copulas.
The focus marker is not obligatory in non-verbal predications. All the examples given
above could equally well appear without the focus marker. The distribution of focus
markers in non-verbal clauses is identical to their distribution in verbal clauses. In both
cases, it is pragmatic factors of focus marking which determine whether these words will
appear in a clause or not; whether the clause is verbal or non-verbal is irrelevant. Rather,
non-verbal clauses, like verbal clauses, may or may not be grammatically marked for
28011 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSfocus, and thus can appear with or without the focus marker, on those grounds alone.
There are two further major syntactic objections to treating the focus markers as copulas.
The first is that normally, the constituent which the focus marker is in construction with
does not move to the front of the sentence. Instead it stays in its place within the clause.
The focus marker appears immediately after it. Consider the following example:
81)Aira

3plEFOC
e2 014bIt is possible to say umalau o uvikola fiv, aira la onorev hiv, but usually people
donÕt. They leave the focussed constituent in place in the clause. The fact that these
focussed constituents are not extracted makes a cleft analysis problematic.
There is a further problem with analysing Lavukaleve focus markers as copulas, even if
one does not argue that sentences like these are clefts. If one argues that the SentenceInternal focus marker is a copula, then one would be forced to say that in Lavukaleve it is
possible to intersperse a main clause with an embedded copula clause. That is, in the
above example (81), one would have to say that umalau o uvikola fiv is a copula
clause, embedded in the sentence aira la onorev hiv. These objections make very
unattractive the analysis that clauses with Sentence-Internal focus markers are copula
clauses.
11.6.3 FOCUS SYSTEM VERSUS ALIGNMENT SYSTEMIt is possible to be misled by the agreement patterns of the Agreement Suffix on the verb
and the focus marker into thinking that they form part of a syntactic alignment system.
Consider for example, that in positive clauses the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus
marker generally agree with O of a transitive clause and S of an intransitive clause; and
that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with A/S in negative clauses.
This phenomenon might suggest that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker are
actually forming part of a split-ergative agreement system determined on purely syntactic
principles. There are a number of reasons why this analysis would be unsatisfactory.
Firstly, not all positive clauses have the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker
agreeing with O; sometimes they agree with A. So one would have to find syntactic
reasons why in these cases agreement was with A, not O. One could argue that the splitergative system was based on partially syntactic and partially pragmatic principles; and
this kind of system does occur (rarely) in the languages of the world (see e.g. Dixon
1994: 211). But such an analysis would fail to account for the pragmatic function of the
focus marker in the sentences in which it occurs; and it would miss the generalisation that
the agreement of the focus marker (and verbal Agreement Suffix) can be predicted without28111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSexception by knowing which part of a sentence is being focussed on.9
11.6.4 A TYPOLOGICAL NOTELambrecht and Polinsky (1997) propose some typological universals with respect to the
grammatical encoding of sentence focus. They argue that there is a formal, paradigmatic
relationship between predicate focus and sentence focus constructions in languages:
Ò[sentence focus] constructions have the form they do because they are to be minimally
distinct from corresponding [predicate focus] constructions within a given languageÓ
(Lambrecht and Polinsky 1997: 191).
As a corollary of this, as sentence focus involves lack of a topic-comment structure, it is
important that the subject of a sentence focus construction must be marked in such a way
that it cannot be interpreted as a topic; thus, Ò[sentence focus] marking crucially involves
DETOPICALIZATION of the nominal constituents involvedÓ (p. 191). This detopicalisation can
be accomplished in one of two ways: either by cancelling formal properties typically
associated with topic arguments; or by coding the subject of a sentence focus construction
formally in a way typically associated with focus arguments. This leads to their Principle
of Subject-Object Neutralisation, which says that subjects of sentence focus constructions
are grammatically coded with properties typically associated with objects; and their
Principle of Topic Cancellation, which says that the subject of a sentence focus sentence
cannot be coded in a similar formal way to topics.
In English, sentence focus is marked formally by a prosodic accent on the subject NP.
This marking type, they say, comes about through paradigmatic opposition to predicate
focus marking in English, in which the prosodic accent is on the object: Òthe position of
the accent on the subject noun in the [sentence focus] construction is the result purely of a
formal requirement: the need to indicate a paradigmatic contrastÓ (p. 195). They present a
typology of formal marking of sentence focus, as opposed to predicate focus: sentence
focus marking in a given language may involve prosodic inversion, that is, giving the
sentence focus subject the prosodic accent usually associated with an object (or predicate);
changes to linear order; making the subject a single constituent within the predicate
(syntactic inversion); making the subject a non-topic; giving it non-nominative case
marking; or giving the verb impersonal agreement. Lavukaleve does not fit with any of
these formal marking strategies, but even though the material it uses to mark sentence
focus versus predicate focus is not covered in Lambrecht and PolinskyÕs typology, the
system it uses to mark the opposition between sentence focus and predicate focus is
exactly parallel to those used in many other languages.
That is, focus marker agreement in sentence focus and predicate focus constructions in
9Note that a split-ergative system does exist elsewhere in Lavukaleve. In subordinate adverbial clauses
first and second person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system, and third
person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.","[305, 306, 307, 308]"

Noun formation
Verbal inflectional processes in Lavukaleve are remarkably regular; all verb stems are
completely regular, and apart from a couple of straightforward morphophonemic rules,
there is only one form for each verbal affix. Nouns and noun inflections are, conversely,
very irregular. In many cases there are slightly different noun stems depending on
which suffix or prefix is to be added, and these are unpredictable by rule. In addition,
for some categories, the form of the suffix taken by a particular noun cannot be
predicted.
There are six formation processes which can apply to noun stems: Locative suffix -n;
Perlative suffix - ne; Folk suffix -mil; the possessed noun formation process; dual
formations; and plural formations.
This chapter explores factors associated with the formation of noun stems. It describes
each of the noun formation types in turn, and explains what morphological regularities
can be found, and shows the limitations of such morphological regularities. To begin
with (Section 5.1), I will clarify the notions of noun roots and noun stems. Sections 5.2
to 5.6 describe separately the types of formations which may apply to noun stems.
Section 5.6, the major part of this chapter, discusses in detail the complex principles
associated with the formation of dual and plural nouns.
5.1 INTRODUCTION: LEXICAL ROOTS AND STEMS
All nouns have a citation form. This is the form which the Folk, dual and plural suffixes
are added to. In addition to this citation form of the stem, some nouns have a different895 - NOUN FORMATIONlocative stem, which is the stem which the Locative and Perlative suffixes are added to1.
In many nouns this locative stem differs from the citation stem by the addition of extra
material before the suffix. This extra material is unpredictable.

Ô(in a) different placeÕTo avoid confusion about the level which the description to come is referring to, I will
use the following terminology to refer to different types of nouns or parts of nouns. I
will say that every noun is a lexical root. This lexical root may have one or two stems:
the citation stem, and the locative stem. The lexical root is in almost all instances
formally identical to the citation stem (see Section 5.6 for an instance of where this is
not the case).
Also important for the relationship between lexical roots and stems is that many nouns
appear in their citation stems as consonant-final, whereas their locative stem is vowelfinal, and further, their dual and plural suffixes begin with the same vowel which
appears as the final vowel of the locative stem. This might make it seem that the vowel
is part of the stem, not part of the suffixes, but, as will shortly be seen, this is not a good
analysis. To begin with, consider the following examples:

-Examples like this might make one want to posit an underlyingly vowel-final form for
the lexical root; e.g. *kekera, *namutina, etc. However, many consonant-final lexical
roots add a vowel to form the locative stem, and add a different vowel for the dual or
plural forms. For example:

reference. It can co-occur with the Causative suffix (which it follows), and the
Agreement Suffix (which it precedes). Tense-marked verbs cannot receive Aspect or
Mood suffixation, but note that the Future Tense suffix can be used with the Habitual
Auxiliary (see Section 14.3). As tense marking does not occur on negated verbs, to
express a negative future clause, the Habitual Auxiliary with the Future Tense suffix
must be used in construction with a negated verb:

cs2 033There is a morpheme formally identical to the Future Tense marker, which marks
coordinate-dependent verbs which form a sequence with the following clause. It can be
easily distinguished from the Future Tense marker on morphological and semantic
grounds. A verb marked by the Non-Finite suffix cannot receive subject crossreferencing, can receive certain Aspect marking, and has no constraints on time
reference. Conversely, a Future Tense marked verb can easily occur with subject crossreferencing (as shown in the above examples), cannot receive Aspect marking (as
mentioned above) and can only have future time reference. The Non-Finite suffix is
discussed in Section 15.4.4.","[323, 324]"

Overview of clause structure, predicate
types and core participant marking
The aims of this chapter are twofold. The first part of this chapter describes and justifies
the theoretical premises on which the analysis of the syntactic structures of Lavukaleve
is founded, and outlines the grammatical terminology used in this thesis. In addition,
there is a discussion of which arguments are core arguments and how they are
expressed.
Secondly, the chapter provides a brief overview of clause structure, constituent order,
predicate types and core participant marking, in order to enable the reader to parse
sentences in the rest of the description without necessarily having read every word of
the grammar. As these parts of the chapter are intended as an overview, structures are
discussed briefly, with cross-references to detailed discussions of each construction type
elsewhere in the thesis.
9.1 BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE
Basic clauses in Lavukaleve consist maximally of a predicate, which is the head of the
clause, two core NPs (subject and object arguments of the predicate), and any number
of adjuncts, which may be various types of nominal adjuncts, adverbs or particles.
There are no verbs whose argument structure requires an adjunct, although there are
many verbs which commonly appear with adjuncts.
9.2 CONSTITUENT ORDER
The predicate is typically the final constituent of the clause (see below for a definition
2059 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREof predicates; prototypically, it means a verb, or anything that acts like a verb). Core
NPs precede the verb; if there are two, the subject must precede the object. There is thus
a fairly strict constituent order for basic Lavukaleve clauses: SOV (or, using DixonÕs
(1979) syntactic primitives, which are introduced below, SV/AOV).
Adjuncts may appear anywhere between these NPs and the predicate, although they
may not intervene between elements of the NP. A textual example of a near-maximal
clause:

volori-¿

firsthi].
hi
3sgnEFOCSo the sea eagle and the woman built a house first.gm 046In example (1) above, constituents are separated with square brackets. There are two
NPs; taragau na ne ruia la, the subject; and tail fi, the object (with a focus marker).
The predicate is lovolori hi (with a focus marker), and there are two adjuncts, both
particles, aka and nikol. Focus markers can occur at the end of any type of constituent;
they are a ubiquitous feature of Lavukaleve syntax, and it is almost impossible to quote
an example without at least one focus marker in it; indeed it would be misleading to try.
For a discussion of the morpho-pragmatics of focus marking in Lavukaleve, see Chapter
11.
Most clauses in Lavukaleve, however, consist of many fewer elements than this
maximal pattern implies; indeed there is no example in the corpus of a maximal clause
as outlined above. The only obligatory constituent of a clause is the predicate; all other
members are optional, and in particular, core NPs are often not present in clauses. Basic
clauses, then, typically consist of a predicate, preceded by some adjuncts, and possibly
one or more NPs. A textual example of a more typical type of clause structure:
2)[ Kini]
kini
ACT[ngoham]
ngo- ham
2sg- for[fo'sal]
fo'sal
fish(pl)[voakuru].
voa3plO1sgS-I'll go catch some fish for you.kuru
hit
gm 037In this example, there is an adjunct, kini, followed by another adjunct, ngoham,
followed by an object NP, fo'sal , followed by the predicate, voakuru.
It was stated above that there was a fairly strict constituent order SV/AOV. This is for
the most part true; if both subject and object NPs occur before the predicate, they must
occur in that order, and usually the predicate is the final element of the sentence.
However it is not unknown for one of the NPs, usually the subject NP, to appear after
the predicate. If this does happen, there is almost always an intonation break between
2069 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREthe predicate and the NP. Many such constructions seem to be repair constructions, in
which the speaker, having omitted to mention the NP subject overtly, then wonders
whether the hearer understood it properly, and adds it in as an afterthought.

after the predicate with no intonation break between the predicate and it. In Section
11.4.2 it is argued that these are not anomalies of constituent order, but rather are in fact
examples of demonstratives functioning as focus markers.
Adjuncts, too, can appear after the predicate, usually as an afterthought. Note the

cp 037 - 038It was stated above that adjuncts can appear between any of the other constituents in a

adjunct positions within a clause.
9.3 SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS AND GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
9.3.1 S YNTACTIC FUNCTIONSThe grammatical relations of Lavukaleve will be established using the universal
syntactic primitives A, S, and O of Dixon (1979, see also 1994), as defined rather more
narrowly by Andrews (1985).
For Andrews, the syntactic functions of A and O (Ôgrammatical functionsÕ in his
terminology) are defined in terms of the prototypical core arguments of prototypical
Primary Transitive Verbs; verbs which take two arguments, the semantic roles of which
are Agent and Patient (e.g. ÔkillÕ) (1985: 68). The syntactic function of A is Òan NP in a
transitive sentence receiving the treatment normally accorded to the Agent of P[rimary]2079 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURET[ransitive] V[erbs]; an O is an NP in a transitive sentence receiving the treatment
normally accorded to the Patient of a PTV.Ó (1985: 98). The syntactic function of S is
that of Ò[an] NP in an intransitive sentence that is receiving the treatment normally
accorded to the single argument of a one-argument predicateÓ (1985: 68).
9.3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONSThe syntactic functions of A, S and O are unproblematic in Lavukaleve; however for the
purposes of describing Lavukaleve morpho-syntax, rather than using A, S and O, it is
simpler and descriptively more revealing to use the grammatical relations of subject and
object. These grammatical relations are defined in terms of A, S and O. Subject is, again
using AndrewsÕ definition, Òthe grammatical relation, if there is one, that is associated
with A and S function; object the grammatical relation, if there is one, that is associated
with O functionÓ (1985: 103).
The following section justifies the theoretical and descriptive validity of the
grammatical relations of subject and object for Lavukaleve.
S UBJECTSIn almost every area of Lavukaleve, A and S pattern the same way in morphological
terms, and O patterns differently. Thus, on the basis of certain morphological tests, a
grammatical relation of Subject can be set up. None of Lavukaleve syntax is based on
constructions which require a pivot. Conjoined clauses of the sort Ôthe man hit the
woman and ran awayÕ (to use a time-honoured example) are expressed by clauses joined
in either subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent structures; in either case,
arguments tend not to be shared at the morpho-syntactic level, or at least, to not be
necessarily shared. That is, one could say Ôhim hitting the woman, the man went awayÕ;
Ôhim hitting the woman, she went awayÕ; Ôhim coming, he hit the womanÕ; Ôhim
coming, the woman hit himÕ and so on. In all cases, arguments are expressed by
pronominal affixes, except where this is precluded by combinatorial restrictions on
affixes. However, throughout most of its morphology, Lavukaleve is a
nominative/accusative language. The only area of exception is in adverbial subordinate
clauses, which show a split-ergative pattern, in which 1st and 2nd person subjects
follow a nominative/accusative marking system and 3rd person subjects follow an
ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.
Lavukaleve has no case marking for core argument roles, but its pronominal verb
prefixes are marked for grammatical relations. Compare the following:

mn2 051-052No words, not even the focus marker, can intervene between the verb and me with the
Agreement Suffix. There are good reasons however why one would not want to say that
the me word is suffixed to the verb. The element is phonologically an independent
word; it can be said in isolation.
It is a different morphological word too. One observation in this regard relies on
parallelism with the prefixed forms of the Habitual Auxiliary. One would not want to
say that the me which is prefixed for its subject is different in its fundamental syntactic
nature from the me which receives the Agreement Suffix. All verbs are capable of
receiving either prefixes or the Agreement Suffix for participant marking, and the
Habitual Auxiliary, although it is not a verb, is no different in this respect. The me
which receives a prefix for subject is definitely a separate word from the verb which it
follows; and thus, the simplest analysis, without evidence to the contrary, is that the me
which receives the Agreement Suffix is too.
There is a further reason for saying that me with the Agreement Suffix is a separate
word from the verb, to do with participant marking. In these constructions, regardless of
the transitivity of the verb, the suffix on me agrees with the subject (S/A). If the verb is
transitive, it takes an object prefix. It is ungrammatical for an intransitive verb to take
the subject prefix and me to be unmarked; or for the transitive verb to take subject
marking and me to take object marking. If the verb and me were morphologically one
word, one would expect, judging from all other participant marking rules in the
language, that participant marking would be flexible in this respect; one would expect
subject or object to be marked at either end of the word, as it can be in any verb. The
fact that there is no flexibility here suggests that this is not one morphological word.
Rather, the rule is that the verb, if transitive, must mark its object. This is in fact a fixed
rule throughout the language; see Section 9.7 for discussion. For these reasons, me is
regarded as a separate word, both on the phonological and morphological levels, in
these (as indeed in all other) constructions.
The word me, suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re, plus the Agreement Suffix, is
used with negated verbs to express negative habitual-state meanings3. The resulting
construction differs from the construction discussed above only in that the auxiliary me
is always suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re in these constructions, and the3There are also four positive examples of this construction in a corpus of around 5000 sentences.","[381, 382]"

identifiers and verb adjuncts. There is a definite article, unlike in almost all Papuan
languages. It is marked for gender and number, and is the final member of a noun
phrase. Many of the Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands have definite articles,
but they precede, rather than follow, their noun.
Nouns are divided into three genders. This is a feature common in languages of the East
Papuan Phylum, and rare in Oceanic languages. Gender in Lavukaleve is marked in
agreement forms on all noun modifiers, and on verbs through participant marking
prefixes and suffixes. Gender distinctions are maintained in singular and dual forms
throughout all areas of the language, but are collapsed in the plural. Nouns are overtly
marked for number, and the methods of marking number are highly complex and
irregular. There are up to 80 different ways of creating dual and plural forms of nouns.
Plural formation depends largely on phonological and semantic criteria, and also bears
some relationship to gender. Dual formation operates on different principles, largely
depending on the phonological shape of the singular noun. There is case marking for
three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load. Possession is marked
by a prefix on the possessed noun. Types of possession are undifferentiated, as in most
Papuan languages, as opposed to Oceanic languages, in which possession is frequently a
very complex area. In Oceanic languages, possessive affixes are frequently the same as
object affixes; in Lavukaleve, all but one are identical to subject affixes. Like in most
Papuan languages, but unlike in Oceanic languages, all modifiers follow their head
noun.
Deictics are a highly elaborated feature of Lavukaleve. There are personal pronouns for
1st and 2nd persons, but not for 3rd person. The functional domain of personal
pronouns in the 3rd person is filled instead by a demonstrative modifier, and two
demonstrative pronouns, all three of which are marked for gender, number and three
degrees of distance from the speaker, with a further distinction made in the distal
category between specific and non-specific location. The two demonstrative pronouns
differ solely in terms of their discourse pragmatics. One is used for a referent which is
uppermost in the minds of speaker and addressee. The other is used for a referent who
was referred to previously but who is not the last referent to have been mentioned. This
demonstrative is used to switch attention between more than one referent in a discourse.
The demonstrative modifier and this demonstrative pronoun, along with various other
spatial deictics, have derived presentative forms, and also derived predicative forms.
There is also a set of demonstrative identifiers which occur in a similar functional
domain to the deictic predicates.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex of Lavukaleve words. Person, gender,
number and syntactic role (subject and object) are marked by two prefix slots, and
suffixes mark tense, aspect, mood and derivational categories such as causative,
reciprocal, locativisation, nominalisation, intransitivisation, and intensity. There are also
121 - I NTRODUCTIONthree categories of subordination, as well as other categories including negation and
extendedness, which can be marked by verbal suffixes. Verbs can also take a suffix to
mark the gender and number of one participant. This gender/number marking is used to
mark the subject of stative/resultative intransitive verbs (as opposed to active
intransitive verbs which use a verbal subject prefix to cross-reference their subject), and
occurs also on the verbs of relative clauses and focus constructions.
Complex predicates are extremely common, and consist of verb-plus-auxiliary
structures, serial verb constructions, and, to a much lesser extent, verb-adjunct
combinations. Serial verb constructions are common in both Papuan and Oceanic
languages, and adjunct constructions are well known in Papuan languages. Lavukaleve
however does not make extensive use of either, preferring separate clauses for
combining predicates and other expressions in general for common collocations.
Like many Papuan languages, one of the methods Lavukaleve uses to combine
predicates is clause chaining. There are three verbal suffixes used in clause chains,
which indicate the temporal relationship of the chained clause to the following clause.
However, unusually for a language which has clause chaining, there is no switchreference marking, and indeed there are no restrictions on argument sharing between
chained clauses. Subordination is also a very frequent method of clause combining, and
there are a few different semantic types of subordinate clauses. While in almost all areas
of its morpho-syntax Lavukaleve is a nominative/accusative language, adverbial
subordinate clauses involve a split-ergative marking system in which first and second
person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system whereas
third person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system. Relative clauses are
internally-headed; their heads are syntactically part of the relative clause, not the main
clause.
Constituent order in Lavukaleve is fixed: SV/AOV. Departures from this norm are rare;
an argument which is an afterthought can be postposed. Preposing and postposing for
emphasis do not occur in Lavukaleve; these pragmatic functions are carried out instead
by focus constructions.
Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope
131 - I NTRODUCTIONof the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.
There is a deep relationship between deictics and focus markers involving, among other
things, a system of alliterative discord, a type of agreement system in which the form of
a deictic in a focus construction requires the form of the focus marker to disagree with it
in its initial consonant.
Focus marking and deictics are the most highly elaborated areas of Lavukaleve morphosyntax, and indeed the largest chapters of this description are devoted to these. In these
areas Lavukaleve finds grammatical expression of discourse-pragmatic domains of
focus, emphasis and activation. Indeed, as is clear from the description to follow, it is
not possible to explicate the basic morpho-syntax of Lavukaleve without making
constant reference to these pragmatic domains.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"23610 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXinvolve (in terms of their morpho-syntax at least) a sentence focus construction; it is not
possible to mark predicate focus in negative clauses. Negation is discussed in general in
Section 17.2, and with particular reference to focus constructions in Section 11.3.2.
In all Sentence-Final focus constructions, the Agreement Suffix must obligatorily agree
with the same element that the focus marker agrees with. Together, the Agreement
Suffix and focus marker serve to show morphologically what type of focus a particular
construction is expressing.
There are rare examples in which a transitive predicate receives the Agreement Suffix to
mark an argument, but there is no focus marker, and the construction is not a relative
clause. For example:
14)Akovere

jt2 036Such examples can always have a focus marker inserted after the verb with the
Agreement Suffix on it; in fact it appears that these examples are a fast-speech casual
expression of a focus construction. When transcribing such constructions, informants
usually correct them by inserting a focus marker. Similarly, when asked if such strings
are grammatical, informants usually give a preferred version with a focus marker. So
example (14) above is, according to native speakers, better expressed as the following:
17)Akovere
akove
3sgmO- look.forkoi kini amare

-re koi kini ama -re hano ma- u -m

speakers, even though they do (rarely) occur in natural speech. Note that most of the
examples of this phenomenon in the corpus are given by just two speakers.
23710 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXIt seems, then, that these sentences are focus constructions without the focus marker.
Constructions involving the Agreement Suffix on the verb, without any grammatical
environment to account for it, can be seen themselves as the equivalent of focus
constructions proper, at least in casual speech.
10.3.1 OMISSION OF THE A GREEMENT S UFFIX IN S ENTENCE-FINAL FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSWhile the Agreement Suffix is an integral part of Sentence-Final focus constructions, it
occasionally happens that in an otherwise normal Sentence-Final focus construction the
Agreement Suffix is omitted. This only occurs with the plural Agreement Suffix, and
only in casual speech. For example:

emk 016The fact that this only happens with the plural Agreement Suffix may suggest that it
could be a phonologically-determined phenomenon, but there are no other examples in
the language of word-final /v/ being omitted.
Native speakers produce these sentences, but they correct them if I produce them, and
when transcribing such sentences produced by other native speakers they often accept
them only reluctantly, preferring to restore the Agreement Suffix on the verb. Note that
the absence of the Agreement Suffix on transitive predicate focus sentences leads to the
anomalous situation that the verb is not cross-referenced for its object, which all
transitive verbs in Lavukaleve must be.
10.4 THE AGREEMENT SUFFIX WITH ADJECTIVES
The Agreement Suffix occurs obligatorily on all regular adjectives in an NP to agree in

is one of many suffixes used to create plural noun forms. See Section 5.6.2 for a
discussion of plural suffixes in nouns. The segment /v/ is pervasive as a marker of
plurality throughout the language.
If there is more than one adjective in an NP, each one has its own Agreement Suffix.
That is, the Agreement Suffix is the property of an individual adjective, rather than a
whole modifier phrase:

sequence, rua ÔbigÕ, is an irregular adjective with its own inflectional paradigm, so it
does not take the Agreement Suffix (see Section 3.3). But the second adjective,
folufolum ÔfatÕ, has the Agreement Suffix, as does the third. The expression of ÔhungryÕ
is actually formed by a complex phrase involving keaki, plus Specifier adjective mea
(see Section 4.1.2), which carries the Agreement Suffix.","[262, 263, 264, 265]"

Tense, aspect and mood
12.1 INTRODUCTION
All morphological categories of tense, aspect and mood (TAM) are marked by suffixes
on verbs (see Chapter 14 for discussion of how these suffixes operate in complex
predicates). There are two Tense categories: Present and Future; there are two Aspect
categories: Imperfective and Durative; and there are six Mood categories: Admonitive,
Durative Imperative, Punctual Imperative, Hortative, Abilitative and Extended.
TAM is not an obligatorily marked category; even when semantically appropriate, there
is no obligation for speakers to use it. Most TAM suffixes are incompatible with most
other verbal morphology.
Further, most of these affixes cannot combine with each other. The following table sets
out the TAM suffixes, and their combinatorial possibilities with other verbal
morphology:29512 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODCombinatorial Possibilities of TAM morphology

Number of subject is marked in the Present Tense suffix.
Rare.
The table makes clear that object cross-referencing is compatible with all TAM
morphology, but subject cross-referencing is much less so. Generally only one TAM
category can be marked per verb.
TAM is not the complex and elaborated area that it is in some East Papuan Phylum
languages, for instance Yele (Henderson 1995) or Motuna (Onishi 1994). In both of
these languages, there are highly elaborated TAM categories, expressed by extremely
complex agglutinative verbal morphology. LavukaleveÕs system, by contrast, is
relatively simple, with few contrasts and simple morphological means of expressing
them.
12.2 TENSE
There are two morphologically marked tense categories in Lavukaleve: the Present
Tense and the Future Tense. The Present Tense morphology contains information about
the number (sg/du/pl) of the subject, whereas the Future Tense marker just marks Future
Tense. Neither the Present Tense nor the Future Tense markers are obligatory in
contexts in which they are semantically appropriate, and in fact in many verb forms they29612 - TENSE, ASPECT AND MOODare disallowed. Tense cannot be marked on subordinate adverbial or coordinatedependent verbs, and Tense marking cannot co-occur on the same verb as aspect or
mood marking.
Because Present Tense and Future Tense marking are not obligatory even in
semantically appropriate and morphologically allowed contexts, there is no reason to
suggest that there is, in structuralist terms, a Past Tense marked by zero. Such an
analysis would force one to distinguish between unmarked Present or Future Tense
marking, and zero Past Tense marking; such a distinction would be difficult to sustain,
in theory and in practice.
12.2.1 THE FUTURE TENSEThe Future Tense is marked by verbal suffix -re. The Future Tense category marks an
event or state as being located in a time which is after now. In Chung and TimberlakeÕs
(1985) terms, it is an absolute tense marker, marking time with respect to the speech
event. Some examples:

Complex predicates
There are four kinds of complex predicates in Lavukaleve: serial verb constructions,
verb compounds, verbal complexes using the Habitual Auxiliary, and predicates formed
with verbal adjuncts. Serial verb constructions are common, although Lavukaleve is not
such a heavily serialising language as many Papuan languages; or indeed many of the
Austronesian languages of Oceania. If serial verb constructions are not a major feature
of Lavukaleve syntax, verb compounds are even less so; there are only three verb
compounds in the language. They probably represent lexicalised serial verb
constructions. The Habitual Auxiliary is an aspectual auxiliary which forms what is here
called a verbal complex: a predicate type that consists of a verbal head plus the Habitual
Auxiliary. Complex predicates formed with verbal adjuncts consist of two parts; the
adjunct expresses the lexical meaning of the predicate, and it occurs with a semantically
rather empty verb, which may be either hai ÔdoÕ or sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ.
14.1 SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS
14.1.1 INTRODUCTIONSerial verb constructions consist of two or, rarely, three verbs in juxtaposition,
functioning as a single predicate, with no morphology to mark their relationship with
each other. Each of the verbs receives its own stress, and thus is a separate phonological
word, but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Verbs of a
serial verb construction share their subjects and (if more than one member is transitive)
objects. They also share adjuncts. They share all their morphology except object
marking; all transitive verbs cross-reference their own objects. However, all other
categories that can be marked on verbs (e.g. subject marking, TAM, polarity, valency
changing, and other morphology) are marked only once on the predicate, and have
33914 - COMPLEX P REDICATESscope over the whole predicate. See Section 15.4.6 for an account of the difference
between serial verb constructions and clause chaining constructions.
The following examples illustrate some of the basic structural features of serial verb
constructions in Lavukaleve:

jn2 100-101In example (1) above, the first verb is transitive and the second intransitive; they share
their subjects (although these subjects are not cross-referenced). Both verbs are covered
by the scope of the Imperative suffix, which appears on the second verb. In example (2),
both verbs are intransitive, and the subject of the serial verb construction is marked only
once, on the second verb. In example (3) there are two serial verb constructions: vau
ehoire consists of an intransitive verb followed by a transitive verb. They are together
functioning as a coordinate dependent predicate, with Non-Finite suffix -re showing
this; note that the Non-Finite suffix appears only once on the predicate, on the final
verb. The transitive verb receives an object suffix. The second serial verb construction
in this sentence is another coordinate dependent predicate, again with the Non-Finite
suffix. Because these serial verb constructions are coordinate dependent predicates, they
do not cross-reference their subjects; this is a feature of all such predicates (see Chapter
15). Example (4) shows a three-verb serial verb construction, with the first two verbs
transitive, each cross-referenced for their object argument (though the object prefixes
refer to the same entity). The Imperative suffix on the third verb has scope over all three
verbs of the predicate.

14.1.2 S ERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS ARE SINGLE PREDICATESThe criterial feature of serial verb constructions is that they consist of two or three verbs
functioning together as a single predicate. This can be seen easily in Lavukaleve: serial
verb constructions participate in all the same constructions which simple predicates do.
Example (3) showed two serial verb constructions in the role of the coordinatedependent predicates of a clause-chaining construction. Further examples of serial verb
constructions serving as a single predicate in various complex constructions appear
below.
In the following example, ma ve Ôtake goÕ is the complex lexical head of a complex
predicate involving the Habitual Auxiliary (see Section 14.3 for a discussion of Habitual
Auxiliary constructions). The entire predicate is in a focus construction as well.

"In Lavukaleve, the situation is similar to this. One could think of the deictic as the head,
29111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSthe form of which determines the agreement of the focus marker. An f-stem deictic head
(pronoun foia) requires an h-stem focus marker (heo). An h-stem deictic head (hoia)
allows an f-stem focus marker (feo). This is alliterative discord in the sense that the
agreement markers, f and h, occur on both of the word classes concerned; as markers of
agreement. Concord implies identity; these markers however, agree, as it were, by
disagreeing. This, then, is alliterative discord.
There is also an interaction between f and h within the focus markers; recall that if there
are two focus markers in construction with each other (i.e. in focus-echo constructions),
the first may be either feo or heo, but the second must be heo, not feo. The interaction
between f/h stems in focus markers is somewhat different from the f/h interaction between
deictics and focus markers. With focus markers, the interaction between f- and h-stems is
due to a cumulative effect of a combination between emphasis and focus, and arises as a
corollary of the respective functions of the f-stem and h-stem focus markers.
THE FEO FOCUS MARKERFeo is the ÒelsewhereÓ focus marker; that is, it is used in all contexts where a focus
marker is needed but the conditions are not appropriate for meo or heo. It is used in
statements, not in questions, and in clauses in which there is no foia demonstrative
pronoun, and where there is no strong emphasis. Examples have occurred frequently
throughout this chapter, and more need not be repeated here.
11.8 SUMMARY
There are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, which are used in different constructions.
The constituent with which the focus marker is in construction is the focussed constituent.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate plus its object, a
sentence, an NP or an adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles, non-main
verbs and the first part of complex predicates.
When predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence; thus, these constructions are called Sentence-Final focus constructions. The
agreement of the focus marker determines the domain of focus, thus sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished by the agreement shown on the focus marker.
When arguments are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,
sentence-internally; thus the constructions are called Sentence-Internal focus
constructions.
As a point of embarkation, LambrechtÕs definition of focus was used; he regards focus as
a scope indicator, related to phenomena of assertion and presupposition. LavukaleveÕs
use of focus differs in some respects from many other languages, for example in its
29211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSfrequent focus-marking of dependent clauses, but it was pointed out that since Lavukaleve
so clearly marks what is and what is not focussed, it is no difficult matter to determine
what is focussed in Lavukaleve; and thus an understanding of the pragmatics of focus
marking in Lavukaleve can be arrived at empirically.
It was also shown how LavukaleveÕs focus marking system grammaticalises LambrechtÕs
three-way division of focus into sentence, predicate and argument focus in an extremely
clear way; in fact, Lavukaleve is a better exemplar of his three-way division than English
or the other languages he uses.
Some aspects of LavukaleveÕs focus marking system are highly unusual. For instance it is
unusual for a focus marker to show agreement, and to be so heavily grammaticalised as
LavukaleveÕs obviously is. Further, it is impossible to describe the basic morpho-syntax
of Lavukaleve without having recourse to information structure. This is not uncommon in
languages; what is uncommon is the extent to which the categories of information
structure pervade LavukaleveÕs grammar.","[317, 318, 319]"

single participant is cross-referenced in two different places in one predicate, in
violation of the first principle given above.
In serial verb constructions (see above and Section 14.1), all transitive members of the
serial verb construction mark their object, which must be shared by each transitive verb;
but the subject can be marked only once, on the final verb of the construction. In the
following example, the object is marked by affixation on every transitive verb, and the
subject is only marked, in the form of the Imperative suffix, once:

marking system (see Section 16.1), a split-ergative system in which an intransitive verb
marks a third person subject using an object prefix, and an invariant prefix e- appears in
the subject prefix slot (first and second person subjects, and marking of transitive verbs,
are unaffected). The next example illustrates this. The intransitive subject of kiu ÔdieÕ is
marked by an object prefix:

predicates cannot be marked by affixation on coordinate-dependent predicates, but only
on the final, independent, predicate of such chains:

9.7.1 and 9.7.2, and summarised in Section 9.7.3, follow all the rather complex
participant marking phenomena which appear in the many variants of predicate types.
By way of magnification, some more complex examples are shown here. Such
structures as are shown below are by no means uncommon; in fact, they are somewhat
more common than the simple structures by which the basic principles of the system
were elucidated. Basic principles upon which these predicates are affixed are numbered
according to the summary in Section 9.7.3.
The italicised part of the next example is a complex predicate consisting of a serial verb
2279 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREconstruction. The second verb of the serial verb construction (fale ÔstandÕ) carries the
Negative suffix, but the scope of negation is across the whole predicate, as is normal for
serial verb constructions. Participants are each marked once on the predicate, as per
Principle 1. As this predicate is part of a focus construction (with focus marker fongai)
the subject argument is marked by the Agreement Suffix on the second verb of the
predicate (and on the focus marker), as per Principle 4.

first element of the predicate, the lexical verb:

no participant marking (see above, this Section). Voeleile Ôwhen they wereÕ is
subordinate-dependent; its main clause is also that of the verb vofoirene. Voeleile is
intransitive, and is, in this construction, involved in the type of subordination (with the
Potential -le) that requires intransitive subjects to be marked as objects (see above, this
Section). Vofoirene Ôholding themÕ, the main verb on which all these verbs ultimately
2289 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREdepend, is transitive, and thus must mark its object by affixation (as per Principle 2), but

The Agreement Suffix
Throughout this thesis, much mention is made of the Agreement Suffix and its use in
various constructions. It was stated in Chapter 9 that there are two transitive and
intransitive affixial participant marking patterns for basic Lavukaleve clauses. That is,
an intransitive clause may mark its subject participant with either a prefix or a suffix on
the predicate, and a transitive clause may mark its subject and object participants on the
predicate with either two prefixes, or a prefix and a suffix. In the latter case, subject and
object may be marked by either prefix or suffix, as long as each argument is marked
once and only once.
The Agreement Suffix is used as the marker of an argument of a predicate in certain
grammatical environments. These environments are as follows: the Agreement Suffix is
used on the final predicate of a relative clause to mark the head of the relative clause
construction; it is used to mark a certain argument in focus constructions (the choice of
argument is a matter of some importance, see below); and it is used to mark the sole
argument of a stative or resultative intransitive predicate when not in a focus
construction. The Agreement Suffix is also used on adjectives, to express agreement of
the adjective with its head noun.
Rather than discussing the Agreement Suffix per se, in this chapter the kinds of
constructions the Agreement Suffix occurs in are discussed. The functions of the
Agreement Suffix are by no means pragmatically unconnected, and the aim here is to
bring together all of these uses of the Agreement Suffix in one place, to show the
pragmatic functions of this ubiquitous and important suffix in Lavukaleve morphosyntax.
Firstly, the formal features of the Agreement Suffix will be examined. Then the
23110 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXdiscussion will move on to its uses. Its use in relative clauses, focus constructions and
adjectives will be examined in turn, then the discussion moves on to its use with stative
and resultative clauses.
10.1 FORMAL FEATURES
The Agreement Suffix is, strictly speaking, not a single suffix but a paradigm of
suffixes. Its forms mark gender and number, as the following paradigm shows:

-gel-v10.1.1 THE EXISTENCE OF A ZEROThe 3rd singular neuter form is said, throughout this thesis, to be zero, and it is glossed
in example sentences as such. This zero morpheme has not been posited lightly. There
are three good reasons for saying that Lavukaleve has a zero morpheme for its 3rd
singular neuter Agreement Suffix form. Firstly, although there is no direct evidence of
the 3rd singular neuter Agreement Suffix form, it can be demonstrated that it alternates
with the other forms of the Agreement Suffix. Consider for example the following data
(it is elicited, because minimal trios tend not to occur naturally). The Agreement Suffix
is glossed throughout this chapter in bold:

3sgnFOC
e1 009b/2In the first example of the above trio, the masculine singular Agreement Suffix -m
occurs marking the masculine singular object holu roa Ôa harbourÕ. In the second
example, the feminine singular Agreement Suffix -a occurs marking the feminine
23210 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXsingular object solo la Ôthe mountainÕ. In the third example, there is no overt marking on
the verb for the singular neuter object fagi ga Ôthe islandÕ. However, by comparison
with the other sentences, one could say there is a zero morpheme there (as the gloss
indicates).
The second reason for positing a zero morpheme here is that when sentence-final focus
markers such as those in the above sentences occur after a verb, the verb must appear
with the Agreement Suffix. This is one of the rules of Lavukaleve (see Chapter 11, and
the discussion below). If one says that there is no 3rd singular neuter Agreement Suffix,
then one is forced to change the rule of the verb morphology in focus constructions to
make an exception for 3rd singular neuter arguments. This is a descriptively
unappealing analysis.
The third reason for positing a zero morpheme is that in Lavukaleve, it is obligatory for
all transitive predicates to mark their objects. (This rule was first stated in Section 9.7).
Objects may be marked cross-referenced with a prefix from the object prefix paradigm,
or with the Agreement Suffix. If one said that 3rd singular neuter objects are not crossreferenced with the Agreement Suffix, then one would be forced to amend the rule that
all transitive predicates obligatorily cross-reference their objects, to make an exception
for 3rd singular neuter objects under circumstances where they would be expected to be
marked by the Agreement Suffix (of course, in constructions involving object prefixes,
they still are marked). This again is descriptively unappealing.
Of course, on some level, the 3rd singular neuter Agreement Suffix is just not there. But
in terms of the description of the language, positing a zero in this position simplifies the
analysis and allows more powerful generalisations of processes in Lavukaleve which
probably do have some claim to linguistic reality. For this reason, the 3sgn Agreement
Suffix is considered to be of the form -¿.
Note, however, that it is only posited and glossed in example sentences in circumstances
in which it is certain that another form of the Agreement Suffix would appear. That is, it
is always posited (and glossed) when it is the object of a transitive predicate, or in a
sentence-final focus construction; because the rules of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax mean
that any other form of the Agreement Suffix would appear in those circumstances. But
when a 3rd singular neuter argument is subject of a verb, it is not always certain if the
Agreement Suffix would occur or not, because subject marking is, in many
constructions, not obligatory. In such circumstances, the 3rd singular neuter Agreement
Suffix is not posited and glossed in example sentences.
10.2 THE AGREEMENT SUFFIX IN RELATIVE CLAUSES
The Agreement Suffix is used obligatorily on the final predicate of a relative clause to
cross-reference the head of a relative clause construction. Relative clause constructions
(which are discussed in more detail in Section 16.3) in Lavukaleve are internally23310 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXheaded. That is, the head functions syntactically as part of the relative clause. The
relative clause contains at least one verb, the final one of which is marked with the
verbal Agreement Suffix, plus any full NPs associated with the verb, any adjuncts, and
finally the definite article. Relative clauses can contain quite complex internal
structures, involving subordinate clauses and clause chains for instance (see for example
(6) below, which has a relative clause containing a clause chaining construction). The
final verb in the relative clause receives the Agreement Suffix. The Agreement Suffix
and the definite article agree in number and gender with the head. For example:

HAB...he took his bow that (his mother) had made for him and his two arrows and

Agreement Suffix is followed immediately by the definite article. In all other
construction types, if a verb is followed by the definite article, the verb must have been
23410 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXnominalised, with the Nominaliser suffix (described in Section 13.1). Only in relative
clauses can a non-nominalised verb be followed immediately by the definite article.
Note that relative clauses are nominal modifiers; in this sense, the use of the Agreement
Suffix on relative clauses exactly parallels its use on adjectives (see below), marking the
agreement of the dependent constituent on which it appears with the head of that
constituent.
Note also that in relative clauses and focus constructions, the Agreement Suffix on a
predicate can index an argument in subject, object or postpositional object function. In
all other construction types, the Agreement Suffix on predicates only indexes subjects
or objects. In relative clauses, the Agreement Suffix always indexes the head, and as the
head may be in the syntactic roles of subject, object or postpositional object, the
Agreement Suffix in relative clauses may in fact index arguments in the syntactic role
of object of postposition.
10.3 THE AGREEMENT SUFFIX IN FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
The Agreement Suffix is used to cross-reference a particular argument of a focus
construction. It is shown in Chapter 11 that there are two syntactic types of focus
constructions in Lavukaleve, shown by different agreement patterns of the Agreement
Suffix and focus markers. The Agreement Suffix and the focus marker always agree
with the same entity, and thus always agree with each other. The two syntactic types of
focus, named for the position of the focus marker in the construction, are SentenceInternal focus constructions and Sentence-Final focus constructions. The former is the
construction used to express argument focus; it is not of concern here, as it does not
involve the Agreement Suffix.
Sentence-Final focus constructions with simple verbal or complex predicates do involve
the Agreement Suffix. They consist of a sentence-final focus marker, in construction
with a predicate marked with the Agreement Suffix, and they can be used to express
either sentence focus or predicate focus. Which one of these two types of focus is
intended is shown by the agreement of the Agreement Suffix and focus marker. The
Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with the object of a transitive clause to show
predicate focus; and the subject of a transitive clause, and the subject of an intransitive
clause to show sentence focus.
Predicate focus (Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with object):

word class. It functions as the head of an NP, taking the definite article, but there are
two reasons for not calling it a noun. Firstly, it does not have its own gender, but takes
its gender from the noun whose identity it is questioning. Secondly, it can appear with a
noun immediately following it, in apposition to it, in the same NP, to mean Ôwhich X?Õ.
It is not possible for two nouns to be juxtaposed in this way; normally, two nouns within
an NP must bear a head-dependent relationship to each other, using the possessive
construction (see Section 4.2). For these reasons, although it clearly has a close
relationship with nouns, roi is considered a word of its own word class.

Word-level derivation: word class changing
and valency changing
Nominalisation is a common and productive process in Lavukaleve. There are two
different kinds of nominalisation: the very productive suffix -i ~ -e, which, added to verb
stems, derives an abstract noun; and the less productive -io, with a similar function.
Other word class changing phenomena are rare; there is a Locativiser suffix added to
verbs; adjectives can, rarely, be changed into verbs with the addition of the Causative
suffix; and there is a suffix that is attached to intransitive verbs to form adverbs.
There are a number of valency changing processes. The one valency increasing process is
the Causative construction, and there are three valency decreasing constructions: a
construction involving an Intransitiviser suffix -a; an Impersonal construction, and a
Reciprocal construction. There is in addition one construction which could be described
as valency rearranging, in which subjects of certain verbs are marked using prefixes from
the Possessive, not subject, prefix paradigm.
Note that as well as word-level derivation there is also phrasal-level word-class changing
in Lavukaleve. It was shown in Section 4.1.2 that the word mea ÔSPECifierÕ, normally
an adjective, has a non-adjectival use in which it can occur in construction with a particle
or a nominal adjunct to derive an NP or nominal modifier phrase. See the abovementioned chapter for discussion of this.
This chapter discusses in turn each of the word class changing and valency changing
constructions in Lavukaleve. The first section deals with nominalisations. The discussion
continues in the second section with other word class changing phenomena. The third
section deals with valency changing constructions. The final section discusses the valency
31713 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONrearranging Possessor-subject construction.
13.1 NOMINALISATION
13.1.1 THE NEUTER ABSTRACT NOMINALISER -E~-IThere are three methods by which verbs can be nominalised. Most common is the use of
the suffix -e~-i (glossed NOMZR). This is a very productive suffix, which can be added
to transitive or intransitive verbs.
This suffix is one of the few morphemes in Lavukaleve which is subject to a phonological
rule. Its form undergoes vowel harmony with the height of the previous vowel of the verb
to which it is suffixed:
verb ends in
-a, -o, -e
-u, iform of Nominaliser suffix
-e
-iNote that the rule of reduction of identical vowels at morpheme boundaries, which is a
general feature of the language (discussed in Section 2.9.3), comes into operation with
nominalised verbs which end in -e and -i. This rule means that in practice one cannot hear
the suffix when it is attached to a verb stem ending in /e/ or /i/. However, there is no zero
nominalisation in Lavukaleve, and all verbs ending in /a/, /u/ and /o/ must use this suffix in
order to become nouns; so it is no difficult matter to say that on verb stems ending in /e/
and /i/ the Nominaliser suffix is obligatorily used, then lost due to morphophonemic
processes. Some of the verbs in the table below illustrate this.
The Nominaliser suffix derives an abstract neuter noun from any transitive or intransitive
verb. Semantically, this is action/state nominalisation; that is, it is the kind of
nominalisation in which the derived noun expresses the name of the action or state
expressed by the verb (Comrie and Thompson 1985: 349).
For example, compare the following verbs with their corresponding derived nouns:
VERBDERIVED NOUNlo ÔfinishÕ
ve ÔgoÕ
honia ÔknowÕ
iru ÔsleepÕ (verb)
i ÔdoÕloe ÔendÕ
ve Ôgoing, wayÕ
honiae ÔknowledgeÕ
irui ÔsleepÕ (noun)
i ÔdeedÕThe fact that all nouns derived with this suffix are neuter is an example of morphological
gender assignment; but there is also a semantic association that many underived abstract
31813 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONnouns are of neuter gender. See Section 6.1 for a discussion of the principles of gender
assignment.
A verb suffixed with the Nominaliser suffix may carry with it any of the arguments and
adjuncts normally available to that verb, and carries cross-references for these arguments
with subject and/or object prefixes, as the principles of participant marking outlined in
Section 9.7 dictate.
Derived nouns have the following nominal features: they function as the heads of NPs,
and can thus appear with the definite article, they serve as arguments of verbs or
postpositions, and they may take the Locative suffix. The question of whether or not they
can take Possessive prefixes is a slightly complicated one, which requires some
discussion.
Nouns index possessors using a set of prefixes from the Possessive paradigm. This
nominal Possessive prefix paradigm is formally identical to the verbal subject prefix
paradigm except for one form. The 1st singular Possessive prefix is nga-, whereas the 1st
singular subject prefix is a-. Thus for most derived nouns appearing with a pronominal
prefix, one cannot tell whether the prefix is a Possessive or a subject prefix, as
theoretically it could be either. Some examples will make these points clear. Compare the
prefixes referring to 1st person singular with those referring to 3rd person plural:
1)nga1sgPOSSmy canoegaikoko
canoe2)avo
1sgS- come
my beginning-e
-NOMZR3)avau
1sgS- go.out
I went out4)magaikoko
3plPOSS- canoe
their canoe5)mavo
3plScome
their beginning6)mavau
3plSgo.out
they went out-e
-NOMZRSo derived nouns take subject prefixes, not Possessive prefixes. This leads to a further
point. The fact that a verb complete with subject and object prefix indexing can be
nominalised shows that the nominalising process happens after the verb has been indexed
31913 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONfor these arguments. That is, the bare verb stem is not nominalised; instead, the verb with
its arguments, which may be cross-referenced with prefixes, is nominalised. The
following examples illustrate this point:

the derived nouns, and also the verbal morphology and other verbal characteristics of
them.

To conclude, then, verbs may carry verbal morphology and arguments of their own, and
they may retain these when they are nominalised. However once they have been
nominalised they also have the noun-like properties of functioning as the heads of NPs,
appearing with the definite article, serving as arguments of verbs and postpositions, and
taking the Locative and Perlative suffixes. They do not, however, take Possessive
prefixes.
The following examples illustrate some of these features. The first example shows a
derived noun suffixed with the Locative suffix, which, together with me ÔSPECÕ
functions as an adjective modifying nei ÔcoconutÕ (see Section 4.1.2 for a discussion of
the function of mea ÔSPECifierÕ).

jn2 07316.1.7 S URPRISE CLAUSESThe verbal suffix -meon SURPrise is extremely rare. It occurs on verbs of subordinate
adverbial clauses, so it utilises the special subordinate participant marking system, as
Potential and Anterior subordinate verbs do. No other morphology, apart from these
participant marking morphemes, occurs on verbs suffixed with -meon (although it is
likely that the Causative suffix is possible).
The suffix has a meaning related to expressing a surprising and exciting event, and is
often used at the crux of a story. The suffixed verb itself does not indicate the surprise,
but rather, it indicates a lead-up to the surprising event in the following clause. It tells
the hearer that something surprising is about to happen. It is something like the function
of the English phrase Ôwould you believe itÕ. So the first example below could be more
freely translated as something like ÔHe threw the knife, and would you believe it, it split
his mouth in two!Õ:39416 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSES

almost invariably followed by the particle ta or taman which, broadly speaking, means
ÔjustÕ, ÔbutÕ and so on. The combination means something like Ôjust as X was
happening, then Y!Õ.
16.2 PURPOSIVE CLAUSES
Purposive subordinate clauses are marked by the verbal suffix -ham. They differ from
adverbial subordinate clauses in that they do not receive the split-ergative participant
marking system. Instead they mark their participants in the same way as independent
clauses, but using only subject and object prefixes, not the Agreement Suffix, which is
incompatible with the Purposive verbal suffix. Note, however, that subject prefixes are
rare with Purposive verbs.","[419, 420, 421]"

ja 099Subordinate clauses in the languages of the world are usually thought of as presupposed
information, rather than asserted information, and thus are unlikely to be focussed. In
many languages it is not possible to focus on a subordinate clause; Somali for instance,
which has a pervasive grammaticalised focus system, is typical in not allowing focus
marking in subordinate clauses (Saeed 1984: 24). However Lavukaleve very frequently
focuses on dependent clauses. In Lavukaleve the reasons for this may lie in the types of
information typically supplied by dependent and main clauses respectively.
Firstly, dependent structures in Papuan languages are typically used to carry the event line
of the narrative forward. Anything which carries the event line forward is new,
newsworthy, rather than presupposed information. This is the case, for example, in
examples (59) and (60).
Further, complex clause and sentence structures in Lavukaleve typically encode
semantically full verbs as dependent verbs, and aspectual verbs as main verbs. This
means that the lexically most important part of a sentence is typically the dependent verb,
rather than the main verb. This can be seen clearly in sentences like (57) and (58), which
both contain focussed coordinate-dependent clauses carrying the main semantic weight of
the sentence, with the main clauses in each providing aspectual information. A similar
type of situation occurs in serial verb constructions and verbal complexes with the
Habitual Auxiliary ((61) and (62) respectively). So often argument focus constructions
focus on the part of a complex structure which carries the most semantic weight. In these
27011 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSterms, such constructions make sense.
11.4 TWO RARE PHENOMENA
The basic morpho-syntactic features of the focus system have been outlined above, and
further important issues to do with focus marking are discussed further below. But first,
there are two phenomena to do with the focus system, both of them rare, which should
first be mentioned. The first is that occasionally a Sentence-Final focus construction,
rather than a Sentence-Internal focus construction, can be used to express focus on a
postpositional phrase. The second is that there are some instances in the corpus in which a
demonstrative modifier occurs in the position in which a focus marker would be expected,
in a Sentence-Final focus construction.
11.4.1 ANOTHER WAY OF EXPRESSING ARGUMENT FOCUS OF PPSIt was shown above that in Sentence-Final focus constructions the focus marker always
agrees with the subject or object; and they express sentence or predicate focus
accordingly. For expressing focus on an adjunct, a Sentence-Internal focus construction
is almost always used. However there are extremely rare examples (three in the entire
corpus) of a Sentence-Final focus construction, where the focus marker agrees not with
the subject or object but with a postpositional phrase, and expresses argument focus on
that postpositional phrase:

intransitively with no overt morphological affixation to show the change in transitivity.
There are only about a dozen ambitransitive verbs in the corpus. Of these, there are two
kinds. There are those verbs for which the subject of the intransitive form of the verb
corresponds in semantic role to the subject of the transitive form of the verb; and there
are those in which the subject of the intransitive form corresponds to the object of the
transitive form. In Lavukaleve these two types account for about half of the
ambitransitive verbs each. All ambitransitive verbs in the corpus are listed here with
their intransitive and transitive glosses:

vo ÔcomeÕ (intransitive):

motivation. Verbs with more agentive intransitive subjects fall into the S=A group,
whereas verbs with non-agentive intransitive subjects fall into the S=O group. Note that
many motion verbs pattern with S=O verbs, not S=A verbs. This phenomenon is
common in the worldÕs languages.
TWO IRREGULAR VERBS: TUNA ÔBE REALLYÕ AND TAVE ÔBE NOTÕThere are two intransitive verbs which act slightly differently from other intransitive
verbs. The verbs are tuna Ôbe reallyÕ and tave Ôbe notÕ. (Tuna Ôbe reallyÕ is crossclassified as an adjective and a particle). While both tuna and tave are argument-taking
predicates, able to cross-reference their subject arguments with verbal morphology, and,
in the case of tuna, able to take the Negative suffix -la, neither of them can take any
other verbal morphology. Also anomalous is that they can occur immediately following
another intransitive verb, but not obviously in construction with that verb. For instance,
compare examples (4) and (5), which have tuna and tave functioning as normal

because it is not obvious what relationship they have with that verb. These are different
to serial verb constructions in Lavukaleve, because in serial verb constructions in
Lavukaleve, the shared subject is cross-referenced only once on the whole predicate, not
on each verb as here (see Section 14.1). Also, with tave at least, the intransitive verb
which it follows is always from the same semantic type; it is a verb with a modifying
meaning, often a verb that is cross-classified as an adjective (see next section).
There are a few possible analyses. One is that such examples show a unique kind of
serial verb construction, although this is problematic for the reasons given. Another
possibility is that tuna and tave are not verbs in this context, but rather are some unique
word class such as agreement-taking adverbial particles. (Section 3.17.1 below shows
that adverbial particles do not show agreement). The approach taken here is that the
strange behaviour of tuna and tave is a lexical phenomenon, related to their semantic
properties of being frequently appropriate as verbal modifiers, while retaining other
properties associated with intransitive verbs in Lavukaleve.
Such constructions, with two independent predicates occurring next to each other but
not in a serial verb construction and with no overt relationship to each other, only occur
463 - WORD C LASSESwith verbs tave and tuna; in all other cases, clauses in sequence must be overtly marked
for their relationship with each other, either as subordinate-dependent or coordinatedependent or coordinated independent clauses.
3.3 ADJECTIVES
There are only around fifty adjectives in the corpus. There are doubtless more adjectives
than this in the language, but it is nonetheless significant that such a small number have
been found so far. In many of LavukaleveÕs Oceanic neighbours, it is often a difficult
matter to tell whether a particular word is an adjective or an intransitive verb. This
situation also occurs in Lavukaleve; they usually appear in the same position in the
sentence, and even though intransitive verbs have far more morphological possibilities
than adjectives, they often do not avail themselves of them and in fact usually only
appear with the Agreement Suffix, as do adjectives. Predicative adjectives are
impossible to distinguish from intransitive verbs. However attributive adjectives, as a
syntactic class, do occur, and can be easily described by their syntactic and
morphological features:
·
·
·they occur inside an NP (after the noun, before the definite article, if there is one)
modifying a head noun
they have no inherent gender or number, but agree in gender and number with their
head noun, using the Agreement Suffix paradigm also used by verbs
the only morphology they can receive is the Agreement SuffixIf a word has these features, it is called an adjective. Many adjectives can also appear
predicatively; in these circumstances they are indistinguishable from intransitive verbs.
For example, compare the following uses of ho'bea ÔgoodÕ. In the first example, ho'bea
is used attributively, modifying its head noun mina, and occurring inside the NP
between the head noun and the definite article. In the second example, ho'bea is used
predicatively. It is not possible to tell if it is an intransitive verb, or a non-verbal
predicate, with ellipsed head noun:

EMPHAnd the girl was very beautiful.co 151Note that intransitive verbs, if they are in a clause with stative or resultative meaning,
mark their subject using the Agreement Suffix (see Section 10.5); therefore473 - WORD C LASSESstative/resultative intransitive verbs often appear with the same morphology as
adjectives. If a word can be used as a nominal modifier inside an NP, with the abovementioned other characteristics, it is an adjective. Each such lexical item may have
another, predicative, function, although many do not. If it does, it is considered to be
cross-classified as a verb. Unfortunately, for many of the adjectives listed below the
corpus is not sufficient to show whether, as well as being used attributively, they can be
used predicatively. This area awaits more detailed examination in the future.
Numbers form a subclass of adjectives. They donÕt have inherent gender, they occur in
an attributive relationship with nouns, but they can take, in addition to agreement
morphology (which is only available to ÔoneÕ and ÔtwoÕ), morphology deriving ordinal
forms. Some of them can also take morphology deriving higher-number forms. These
are discussed separately below.
Because there are relatively few adjectives in Lavukaleve, it is worthwhile to list them
exhaustively. Their categorisation is similar to DixonÕs (1982) discussion of semantic
types of adjectives.

Lavukaleve (see Chapter 11 and Section 17.2).
14.3.3 THE INTRANSITIVE VERB ME ÔCONTINUEÕIt was mentioned above that there is an intransitive verb formally identical to the
Habitual Auxiliary. The intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ does not form a complex
predicate; however, it is worth noting its main features here for the sake of comparison
with the formally identical Habitual Auxiliary. This section aims to briefly show that
this intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ is easy to formally distinguish from the Habitual
Auxiliary.
The intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ is no different from other intransitive verbs in the
language. Whereas the Habitual Auxiliary has its own special set of S/A prefixes, the
intransitive verb just uses the regular S/A prefixes common to all intransitive verbs.
Compare the prefixes used in the following sentences with those shown in Section
14.3.1 above. The 3sg subject prefix for the Habitual Auxiliary is lo-, and o- for the
verb (examples (46) and (48)). Similarly, the 1st plural exclusive subject prefix is le- for
the Habitual Auxiliary, and e- for the verb (47). In addition, like all intransitive verbs,
me ÔcontinueÕ can function as the sole predicate of a clause:

mn 027The two words, me Habitual Auxiliary and me ÔcontinueÕ, are obviously semantically
very closely related; indeed there is often no semantic distinction between them.
Presumably they are also historically related. However there are these crucial morphosyntactic differences which force them to be recognised as different morpho-syntactic
entities. When me appears with verbal subject prefixes, as sole member of a predicate, it
is the verb ÔcontinueÕ. When it occurs with the special set of Habitual Auxiliary
prefixes, immediately following a verb, it is the Habitual Auxiliary. Of course, rather
than considering them separate words, one could consider the difference between them
as simply arising out of different constructions in which they occur. The analysis here,
35814 - COMPLEX P REDICATESof one as a verb and one as an auxiliary, is intended to highlight the combinatorial
possibilities of each, and their syntactic functions.
Me ÔcontinueÕ can of course also occur in other complex constructions which are open
to verbs. In the following example, me is the main verb of its clause; ngosiveham is a
purposive adverbial clause subordinate to the me clause. The me clause is focusmarked.

14.4 VERBAL ADJUNCT CONSTRUCTIONS
Verbal adjunct constructions involve a non-predicating element expressing the lexical35914 - COMPLEX P REDICATESmeaning of the construction, in conjunction with a semantically fairly empty verb,
which enables the element to function as a predicate by providing the necessary
morphology.
There are only two verbs in Lavukaleve which take part in such constructions: hai ÔdoÕ
and sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ. The lexical elements involved are of a number of
types, different for each verb. Both verbs can also act as simple predicates; they do not
always occur in these verbal adjunct constructions.
Verbal adjunct constructions are extremely common in Papuan languages, particularly
those of the highlands of mainland PNG (Foley 1986: 119). Lavukaleve differs from
many of these languages in that, while it does have verbal adjunct constructions, they
are not a pervasive feature of Lavukaleve grammar; and in fact there are only two verbs,
and very few adjuncts, that take part in the constructions.
The verb plus adjunct is treated here as a complex predicate because the adjunct of these
constructions is tightly bound to the verb: while the verb is the predicating element, in
that it controls number of arguments and takes the morphology, the adjunct is closely
bound to the verb, and the two elements function as a single constituent. It is not
however an argument of the verb, and is never cross-referenced on the verb.
14.4.1 HAI ÔDOÕHai ÔdoÕ is an ambitransitive verb, which, in its intransitive function, can act as the verb
of a verbal adjunct construction. The lexical elements it can occur with in this
construction are very few, and consist only of the class of verbal adjuncts: fo'for Ôfly,
ÔprepareÕ; va'var ÔtalkingÕ; so'sor ÔfastÕ and ko'kor ÔtightÕ. These words are
presumably old reduplications, although there is no evidence in the language today of
*for, *var, *sor or *kor.
See Section 3.16 for criteria distinguishing verb adjuncts from other word classes. Some

"25111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSand shows that the different constructions in which the focus markers occur, and the
agreement patterns which they display, correlate with different types of focus.
11.3 THE TWO TYPES OF FOCUS CONSTRUCTION
11.3.1 INTRODUCTIONThere are two syntactic construction types in which a focus marker can occur: SentenceFinal and Sentence-Internal focus constructions. Both construction types are a vehicle by
which a speaker can mark a particular proposition as being focussed in a particular way.
The discussion that follows has as its theoretical basis LambrechtÕs (1994) theory of
information structure (see also Lambrecht 1987, Lambrecht and Michaelis 1998 among
others), as a useful and revealing way to understand the forms and functions of those
constructions involving focus markers in Lavukaleve.
I employ LambrechtÕs definition of focus as a starting point towards understanding what
focus means in Lavukaleve, but exactly what pragmatic situations focus constructions are
used for should become clear through the data itself. Even without an a priori definition of
what focus is, it is clear that there is an overt focus marking system in Lavukaleve. The
particular pragmatic functions expressed by this system emerge from the analysis of the
various constructions involved. Saeed (1984: 19) makes a similar observation for Somali,
another language with a grammatical focus system.
LambrechtÕs idea of focus is a refinement of the traditional view of focus as new
information. Under his analysis, focus does not function to mark a constituent as new: for
one thing, it is not constituents alone that convey new information, but rather, the
conveying of information (old or new) comes about via the establishment of relations
between elements of the proposition (1994: 46-50). Indeed, focus functions Ònot to mark
a constituent as new but to signal a focus relation between an element of a proposition and
the proposition as a wholeÓ (p. 210). (Note that Òa focus relation is the pragmatic relation
between a denotatum and a propositionÓ (p. 210)). And further,
I do not define the focus of a sentence as Ôthe new informationÕ ... Rather I claim that
the focus is to be understood as a formal scope indicator, i.e. as a grammatical signal
indicating the scope of the assertion expressed by a sentence or proposition. The focus
indicates which portions of the sentence are asserted and which portions are
pragmatically presupposed. (1987: 374)Further, the focus of a sentence
is seen as the element of information whereby the presupposition and the assertion
DIFFER from each other. The focus is that portion of a proposition which cannot be
taken for granted at the time of speech. It is the UNPREDICTABLE or pragmatically NON-25211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
RECOVERABLE element in an utterance. The focus is what makes an utterance into anassertionÓ. (p. 207, his emphasis)2Focus occurs over a domain: Ò[t]he syntactic domain in a sentence which expresses the
focus component of the pragmatically structured propositionÓ (p. 214). This focus
domain is phrasal, not lexical, because it is the relationship between propositions, not the
mere appearance of lexical items, which serves to convey focus. Thus, focus domains are
always either predicates, arguments, or whole sentences.
Accordingly, there are for Lambrecht three types of focus: predicate focus, argument
focus and sentence focus. Predicate focus is Òthe unmarked subject - predicate (topiccomment) sentence type ... in which the predicate is the focus and in which the subject
(plus any other topical elements) is in the presuppositionÓ (p. 222). Argument focus is
where the Òfocus identifies the missing argument in a presupposed open propositionÓ (p.
222). (ÔArgumentÕ includes any non-predicating expression, including adjuncts.) This is
focus of the Ôidentification typeÕ of the traditional literature. Sentence focus is where Òthe
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-subject
elements)Ó. This is equivalent to the Ôevent-reportingÕ or Ôpresentational typeÕ of focus in
the literature (p. 222).
If one prefers a more semantic definition of focus which works well for the kinds of
pragmatic functions that focus constructions are used for in Lavukaleve, DikÕs (1989:
277) definition is useful. For Dik, focal information is Òthat information which is
relatively the most important or salient in the given communication setting, and considered
by [the speaker] to be most essential for [the addressee] to incorporate into his pragmatic
2LambrechtÕs ideas on focus are not uncontroversial. Dryer (1996) argues that LambrechtÕs definition of
focus is flawed because, among other things, the definition relies on a notion of pragmatic presupposition
which does not distinguish between two possible types of pragmatic presupposition: that involving shared
beliefs between speaker and hearer, and that involving shared mental representations by speaker and hearer.
Dryer argues convincingly that these must be distinguished. Also, LambrechtÕs definition says that the
presupposition part of a proposition is non-focal. DryerÕs main intention is to show that, contrary to wide
belief, non-focus is not the same thing as presupposition.
In a later paper, Lambrecht and Michaelis (1998) distinguish between three types of pragmatic
presupposition: knowledge presupposition, consciousness presupposition and topicality presupposition,
which Òcorrespond to different kinds of assumptions a speaker may have concerning the addresseeÕs state of
mind at the time of an utteranceÓ (1998: 494). Nevertheless the definition of focus used in this later paper
retains the ambiguity discussed by Dryer. However a minor adjustment to LambrechtÕs definition,
replacing ÔpresuppositionÕ with ÔactivationÕ, would, I think, solve DryerÕs problem with the definition.
In any case, for the purposes of the current discussion, it does not actually matter that LambrechtÕs
definition of focus is theoretically flawed in this respect. My central argument is that Lavukaleve has
overt morpho-syntactic expression of different types of focus; it has three different focus constructions,
and these three constructions correspond closely to LambrechtÕs three focus types. In Lavukaleve, what is
and what is not in focus is clearly marked by the focus construction type used.","[277, 278, 279]"

suggestion on the part of the speaker that the addressee(s) and the speaker do
something. It can not be used to mean Ôlet him/them do itÕ; there is no 3rd person
Hortative form in Lavukaleve.
The Hortative is used to include the speaker and either a single addressee or a group of
addressees; no distinction is made morphologically between singular, dual or plural
addressees:

particle bai~bae which means ÔletÕs goÕ, ÔletÕs do itÕ, as in examples (59), (61) and (62).
12.4.4 THE ABILITATIVEThe Abilitative -nen~-nan (glossed ABIL) is suffixed to a verb to express ability: either
in terms of physical or social capacity, or in terms of permission. The Abilitative covers
the same semantic domain as Bybee et al.Õs (1994: 179) term Òroot possibilityÓ, an
agent-oriented modality (in their terms), which Òreports on general enabling conditions
and is not restricted to the internal condition of ability, but also reports on general
external conditions, such as social or physical conditionsÓ. In addition, it covers Bybee
et al.Õs ÒpermissionÓ category, a speaker-oriented modality in which a speaker grants
permission for an addressee to perform an action. It is common cross-linguistically, as
Bybee et al. point out, for grammaticalised permission modality to develop from root
possibility modality.
A verb suffixed with the Abilitative -nen~-nan can receive subject and object prefixes,
but no further suffixes. That is, a verb marked with the Abilitative is incompatible with
Tense, Aspect or further Mood marking, negation, or subordination.
The two forms -nen and -nan are in free variation. The former, -nen, is much more
common than the latter, but both are acceptable in all contexts. There are no obvious
social or geographical factors determining the distribution of the two suffixes.

"322 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYReduplication has been found most frequently on verbs, but also on nouns, adjectives
and adverbial particles in the corpus. The exact shape which reduplication takes
depends partly on the syllabic form of the word to which it applies. There are three
types of partial reduplication, and full reduplication also occurs. Partial reduplication
can take the shape of reduplication of an initial CV, CVV or CVCV:
·
·
·CV reduplication: le ÔseeÕ le-le; namu ÔshakeÕ na-namu; haua Ôcare forÕ ha-haua;
telako ÔoneÕ te-telako; rongea ÔplayÕ ro-rongea; kiu ÔfightÕ ki-kiu
CVV reduplication: rao ÔsurroundÕ rao-rao; veo ÔarriveÕ veo-veo; ria Ôbe crossÕ
ria-ria
CVCV reduplication: namu ÔshakeÕ namu-namu; hului Ôgo roundÕ hulu-hului;
ruvale ÔhugeÕ ruva-ruvaleFull reduplication also occurs, but only in the following two adverbs in the corpus:
karial Ôslowly, gentlyÕ karial-karial, rikai ÔslowlyÕ rikai-rikai. These are considered
reduplications, not two separate repeated words, because they receive one primary
stress, on the initial syllable, which is one of the criterion for words (see below).
While vowel-initial words occur in the corpus, there are no examples of reduplicated
vowel-initial words (although compare iloilo ÔdifferentÕ discussed below, as a possible
example of reduplication in an earlier stage of the language). Similarly, while words of
closed syllables occur in the language, there are no examples of closed-syllable
reduplication.
Reduplication only applies to word stems, not to affixes on words. Thus kiu ÔdieÕ can
appear reduplicated as ki-kiu, and if it has a subject prefix, its reduplicated form
appears as o-ki-kiu (3sgS-DUP-die) Ôhe diesÕ. Similarly the transitive verb volori
ÔmakeÕ has been found as e-volo-volori-ne (3sgnO-Dup-make-IMPF Ô[they] were
making itÕ).
Reduplication is relatively flexible, in that the same word can appear with different
reduplication patterns. For example I have often heard the adverbial particle leon
ÔquicklyÕ, a word frequently heard in conversation, as le-leon, leo-leon and leon-leon,
all with the same meaning: Ôhurry up!Õ. Similarly, compare the forms of the adjective
tula ÔsmallÕ in the following examples:
4)emina

5)mina
mina
thing(f)tulatula
DupREDUP-tula
-a
small -sgfa little thingpr 095The precise form of the reduplication does not seem to have a functional difference: the
reduplicated forms mean the same thing as each other.
Reduplication is obligatory with the Reciprocal suffix (see Section 13.3.4). In other
contexts it often has a semantic function. The word mina ÔthingÕ becomes minamina
ÔeverythingÕ. Similarly lafa ÔplaceÕ when reduplicated is lafalafa Ôevery placeÕ. With
some verbs reduplication can give an iterative meaning, and can imply random action:
veo ÔarriveÕ veoveo Ôkeep touching atÕ, kini ÔsmellÕ kinikini Ôkeep sniffing aroundÕ.
With adverbs it can give an intensified meaning: karial ÔslowlyÕ karialkarial Ôvery
slowlyÕ. It does not always have a semantic function however: there is no meaning
difference between telako ÔoneÕ and tetelako ÔoneÕ.
There are words which are frozen reduplications: e.g. iloilo ÔdifferentÕ (there is no form
*ilo), and the verbal adjuncts va'var ÔtalkingÕ, fo'for ÔflyÕ and so on. See also Section
5.6 for evidence of old reduplications in nouns. These frozen forms suggest that a
process of reduplication has been available in the language for some time.
2.9.2 INSERTION OF GLOTTAL STOP BETWEEN VOWELS AT MORPHEME BOUNDARYWhen identical vowels come together at morpheme boundaries, a glottal stop is
optionally, but very rarely, inserted to break up the vowel cluster: ngo-oatum Ôyour
uncleÕ (2sgPOSS-elder.male) is normally pronounced [÷oatum], but has also been heard
as [÷oÖoatum] (if this rule does not apply, then this sequence in particular is subject to
the next rule to be described, reduction of identical vowels at morpheme boundaries).
This process is not obligatory, and is, in fact, quite rare.
2.9.3 V OWEL LOSSThere are three types of morphophonemic processes involving vowel loss. The first is a
process which reduces identical vowel sequences at morpheme boundaries. The second
is a process of loss of final vowels on nouns to which a Possessive prefix has been
attached. The third is a process in which the final /u/ of a verb stem is lost when that
verb is in a Possessor-subject construction.
REDUCTION OF IDENTICAL VOWEL SEQUENCES AT MORPHEME BOUNDARIESWhen identical vowels come together at morpheme boundaries, one of the vowels is
lost. For example, the 3rd singular neuter object verbal prefix e- plus the Subordinate
342 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYprefix e- reduce to e-:

boundaries. It is not a general rule of the language. Identical vowel sequences are
permitted within morphemes; see Section 2.5 above.
Occasionally, when the two identical vowels coming together are both prefixes,
particularly if both are o- prefixes, this rule of vowel loss does not apply, but rather both
vowels are pronounced as an identical vowel sequence:

gm 027S TEM-FINAL VOWEL LOSS AFTER A P OSSESSIVE PREFIXSome vowel-final noun stems, when prefixed with a Possessive prefix, obligatorily lose
their final vowel. Such noun stems are almost all disyllabic, of the form CVCV.
For example:352 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYbeko
rara
soka
vageÔstoneÕ
ÔsideÕ
ÔfingerÕ
ÔmoundÕo-bek
o-rar
o-sok
o-vagÔhis stoneÕ
Ôhis sideÕ
Ôhis fingerÕ
Ôhis moundÕThis rule does not apply to all CVCV roots. For example:
kala
gera
taluÔmotherÕ
ÔfeelingÕ
ÔwordÕo-kala
o-gera
o-taluÔhis motherÕ
Ôhis feelingÕ
Ôhis wordÕThere are approximately twice as many roots which do not lose their final vowel when
prefixed with a Possessive prefix as those which do. This rule is discussed in more
detail in Section 5.5.
V OWEL LOSS WITH P OSSESSOR-SUBJECT CONSTRUCTIONSPossessor-subject constructions are an unproductive construction type in which the
subject of certain intransitive verbs is marked by a Possessive instead of subject prefix,
stress shifts to that prefix (see Section 2.7.2 above) and, for the verb stems ending in /u/
that enter this construction, the final /u/ is lost:
10)Ovai.
ovau
3sgPOSS- go.out-i
-PSVHe went out.
11)Ohai
ohau
3sgPOSS- go.ashore-i
-PSVHe went ashore.
12)Ofei.
ofeu
3sgPOSS- go.up-i
-PSVHe went up.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"
"372 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYMost utterances in Lavukaleve are vowel-final; verbs (the final element of most
sentences) are, and most verbal suffixing is; in particular, the kinds of things likely to be
yelled at a distance are. Names usually are, and Imperative verbs always are. Of those
things liable to be shouted which are not already vowel-final, the last consonant and
vowel is deleted before /ou/ is added. Thus the name Patterson, when shouted, becomes
[pate'sou].
2.10 ALTERNATIVE REALISATIONS
There are some examples of alternative pronunciations of certain words. These
alternative realisations all involve interchange between different phonemes of the
language. That is, the alternations neutralise the distinction between otherwise
independent phonemes. However, being lexically constrained, and also being optional,
it is never the case that ambiguity arises through the neutralisation of these phonemes in
the words in which it occurs. In each case, I have written the words in question with
their most common pronunciation. The words are:
/d/~ /r/ria
roi
raine['dia] ~ ['ria]
['doi] ~ ['roi]
['daine] ~ ['raine]Ôwhere to?Õ
Ôwhere?Õ
ÔtomorrowÕNote that the /d/ ~ /r/ alternation only occurs in the words initial position. The word
raine also occurs in the word iruraine ÔdailyÕ. In this case the pronunciation can only
be:
iruraine['iru'raine]ÔdailyÕ/b/ ~ /v/beko
vuli['beko] ~ [ºeko]
['buli] ~ ['ºuli]ÔstoneÕ
ÔbehindÕ/n/ ~ /l/mulukuita
halangas['munu'kuita] ~ ['mulu'kuita]
['hana'÷as] ~ ['hala'÷as]ÔmosquitoÕ
ÔcoralÕThese alternations are all a generationally-based phenomenon. Younger people, in their
twenties or younger, tend to pronounce /d/, /b/ and /n/ in certain words where older
people consistently pronounce /r/, /v/ and /l/ respectively. This is not a universal
generational sound change, but rather is lexically constrained.
2.11 WORDS
So far, and indeed throughout the rest of this work, the concept and extent of words is
assumed. In Lavukaleve, the definition of words is a relatively simple matter.
382 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYWords can be defined on phonological grounds. One can pause between, but not within,
a word; this is AndersonÕs (1985: 151) idea of Òpotential pause locationsÓ. On another
level, words have psychological reality; speakers can pronounce them in isolation and
talk about them. Units smaller than a word, however, cannot be easily pronounced or
talked about in isolation. Grammatical words are made up of stems plus, in some cases,
affixes. Phonological words are in almost all cases coextensive with grammatical
words; there are is only one case in which a phonological word is different from a
grammatical word. This is verb compounds. In verb compounds (see Section 14.2) one
grammatical word is made up of two phonological words, each with its own stress. In
all other cases, phonological words are the same as grammatical words.
2.12 ORTHOGRAPHY
An orthography has been in use for a number of years by the Lavukal community. I
follow this established orthography, with a couple of differences. The only respects in
which the orthography used here differs substantially from the IPA conventions are as
follows:
PHONEMEIS WRITTEN/º/
/¼/
/÷/v
g
ngThere is some debate within the Lavukal community about how best to represent the
phoneme /÷/ in the orthography. The symbol nÛÛ was used for some time, in keeping with
the orthographies of other languages of the region. However problems with typesetting
mean that usually the bar is left off, and thus phonemes /n/ and /÷/ are in practice not
distinguished in the orthography. By recent consensus, it has been decided that the
digraph /ng/ should be used instead of nÛÛ.
Stress is not marked in the Lavukal orthography, but in this work I do indicate lexical
stress, by a straight quote before the stressed syllable: vo'vou, only on those stems in
which stress is not on the initial syllable.
Same-vowel sequences are also not represented in the LavukalsÕ orthography, but I do
represent them here in the following circumstances. I always write identical vowel
sequences when they are a part of a mono-morphemic word: see Ôbe fullÕ. However,
when two morphemes come together and create an identical-vowel sequence, a
morphophonemic rule comes into play to reduce the sequence (see Section 2.9), and
these are not represented in the surface forms of words.
Throughout this thesis, four-line example sentences are used. The first line consists of
surface forms; the second line consists of underlying forms; the third line is a
392 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYmorphemic gloss, and the fourth line is a free translation. In many cases, the first and
second lines are identical, but it is useful to have the two separate lines precisely for
those circumstances in which identical-vowel sequences are reduced; and for the few
other morphophonemic processes in the language. At the end of the fourth, free
translation line, comes an abbreviated symbol showing where the fragment comes from.
Appendix 2 contains the list of abbreviations with full details on the source of the data,
showing whether the material was elicited or came from spontaneous texts, and if the
latter, showing the name of the text and the name and village of the speaker.","[63, 64, 65, 66]"

(all extinct)Todd (1975) attempts to formalise the proposal of a genetic relationship between
Lavukaleve, Bilua, Savosavo and Baniata, by means of comparison of morphological
forms in the four languages. Todd used her own data for the classification, which was
far more extensive than the data used by Greenberg and Wurm. She tentatively
subgroups Savosavo and Bilua more closely together than Lavukaleve and Baniata, and
she also suggests that Yele (Rossel Island) may be part of the same family, based on
independent pronoun paradigms, possessive prefixes, noun number suffixes and
vocabulary.
If Lavukaleve does have any relatives, these other three Solomon Islands Papuan
languages, Savosavo, Bilua, and Baniata are the strongest candidates. However they are
structurally very different to Lavukaleve, and indeed to each other, and a genetic
relationship may be difficult to demonstrate. As Capell notes, ÒThese languages [Bilua,
Baniata, Kazukuru, Lavukaleve and Savosavo] share some common vocabulary, but it
is small, and they are more outstanding for their differences not only from
[Austronesian languages] but amongst themselvesÓ (1969: 2).
ToddÕs work is suggestive, but far more work needs to be done on basic grammatical
description of these languages before any firm conclusions about their past are possible.
This grammar, as well as that of Obata (in prep.) on Bilua, is a step in this direction.
1.3.3 MORE RECENT CONTACTLavukaleve has long been surrounded by Austronesian languages, but Tryon and
HackmanÕs (1983) counts of shared lexical items in languages of the Solomon Islands
show that it shares comparatively little of their vocabulary; and indeed comparatively
71 - I NTRODUCTIONlittle with the Papuan languages in the area as well.
Shared lexical percentages between the Papuan and Austronesian languages in the
Solomons are very low (Wurm 1982: 234). The highest shared lexical percentage
between Lavukaleve and a Papuan language is 13.7% (from a comparison of 197
words), with Savosavo (all figures in this section are from Tryon and Hackman 1983).
Lavukaleve shares 7.6% of its lexicon with Bilua (comparison of 197 words) and 8.2%
with Baniata (comparison of 195 words). Austronesian languages on Guadalcanal, the
nearest land mass to the Russells, generally share around 8.5% with Lavukaleve. Poro,
spoken on Santa Isabel, shares 8.9% (from a comparison of 190 words), and Nggela,
from Florida (and widespread as a missionary-encouraged lingua franca) shares 8.7%
(comparison of 196 words), and Langalanga from Malaita shares 8.2% (comparison of
195 words). Most other languages of the Solomons share around 4% or 5% with
Lavukaleve.
These shared lexical percentage figures are very low. As a comparison, Austronesian
languages in the Solomon Islands tend to share around 30%-50% vocabulary with each
other. Lavukaleve shares at most 10.8% with any other Austronesian language (Paripao,
a Lengo language from north-east Guadalcanal).
Thorough comparison of LavukaleveÕs grammar with the grammars of nearby
Austronesian languages is necessary to determine whether, and what kind of, linguistic
borrowing has taken place between them. This thesis is merely the first step in this
process.
In various places throughout this thesis, some comparison is made to various
Austronesian languages, usually where there is a strikingly similar grammatical pattern
to something in Austronesian languages, or evidence of Austronesian loan words in a
particular area of Lavukaleve grammar. The Russell Islands are surrounded on three
sides by islands with Austronesian-speaking people. Lavukal stories tell of a long
history of contact between the people of New Georgia, Santa Isabel and Guadalcanal
and the Russells. For this reason, I generally make comparisons with Austronesian
languages from those areas. Because of the scarcity of linguistic data from many of
these areas, I make most reference to Tolo, a language from south-east Guadalcanal,
which has a dictionary and grammatical sketch (Smith Crowley 1986); Cheke Holo, a
Santa Isabel language with a dictionary and grammatical sketch (White 1988); and
Roviana, a New Georgia language, again with a dictionary and grammatical sketch
(Whitehead 1949). I also have recourse to Proto Oceanic reconstructions, especially
from Ross, Pawley and Osmond (1998).
It is of course far easier to show that a word is Austronesian in origin, than to show
exactly which language Lavukaleve borrowed the word from. When I refer to a word
from a particular Austronesian language, I am not making a claim that that was the
language from which the word was borrowed into Lavukaleve; I am just showing that
81 - I NTRODUCTIONthe word is borrowed. Many words are also borrowed from Solomon Island Pijin; these
words are usually immediately recognisable.
1.4 PREVIOUS WORK ON LAVUKALEVE
Ray (1928) presents some data on Lavukaleve (he calls it Laumbe), including a partial
pronoun paradigm, some information on numerals, possession and adjectives, a few
sentences and a 30-word vocabulary. Capell did some field work on Lavukaleve in
1960, some of which is published in a brief comparative grammatical sketch of
Lavukaleve, Bilua, Baniata and Savosavo (Capell 1969). Todd did a week of field work
on Lavukaleve in 1972-1973 and published a somewhat longer comparative sketch of it
and Bilua, Baniata and Savosavo in Todd (1975). Black (1963), an ethnographic study
of Russell Islanders, is the only other work concerning Lavukal people.
1.5 THE LANGUAGE SITUATION TODAY
In 1954, Capell said of Lavukaleve: ÒIt is spoken only by some 250 people, but a record
should be made of it before it is swamped by Bugotu. There is no doubt that this is what
will ultimately happenÓ (Capell 1954: 85).
This prediction is based on the fact that Bugotu was for some time the lingua franca of
the Melanesian Mission in Santa Isabel and the Russells (Capell 1954: 84), and, given
the small number of speakers Capell found, his prediction was reasonable. However
things have not developed as he expected. The influence of Bugotu has declined, to the
extent that no Lavukal I know speaks it. At the same time, the Solomon Islands has
experienced a population explosion; with a growth rate of 3.5% (Solomon Islands
National Literacy Committee 1992), the Solomon Islands has more people now than it
ever has had. And until recently, this expanded population has been in the villages,
living the traditional lifestyle and speaking vernacular languages. Lavukaleve has more
speakers now than it has ever had.
However, even though the Lavukal population has grown, Lavukaleve itself is seriously
threatened, but the threat comes not from Bugotu but from Pijin and English. Solomon
Island Pijin, the lingua franca for the whole country, has a strong influence in the
Russells. All radio broadcasts are in Pijin or English. The language of the church (both
Anglican and Catholic) is mostly English, although there are some Anglican church
services in Lavukaleve (Church of England in New Zealand 1951, c.1973, and Church
of England in Melanesia 1975), and translation of more liturgies is in progress. School
is conducted in English and Pijin. Apart from the Church of Melanesia orders of
service, there are currently no reading materials available to Lavukal people, written in
Lavukaleve. The languages of the outside world are Pijin and English. Even though
Lavukaleve is the first language for most Lavukals, most people, especially younger
people, are also fluent in Pijin. In the West Russells, people live a very traditional
91 - I NTRODUCTIONlifestyle and have little access to town and outside influences, and all children grow up
learning Lavukaleve as their first language. In the East Russells however, an area much
closer to Yandina both geographically and socially, Pijin is slowly taking over, and
many families do not speak Lavukaleve to their children. As a result, many of the
families I talked to in the East Russells have children who cannot speak Lavukaleve.
This situation of people preferring to use the language of the outside world rather than
their vernacular language is a story familiar from all over the world. For the Lavukals,
the situation will probably get worse as more people move to town to access outside
resources. Experience already shows that when this happens, Lavukaleve may quickly
be lost.
1.6 THE NATURE OF THE DATA USED IN THIS THESIS
The data used in this thesis was collected by me, during three field trips taken between
1995 and 1998. A total of ten months was spent in the field. I lived in Mane Village, in
the family of Patterson Barua, the chief of the Keruval tribe. It was not chance that led
me to this village of all the Russells villages. The West Russells is acknowledged by
Lavukals to have the best language speakers, who do not mix their language with Pijin,
so it was deemed most suitable for me to learn Lavukaleve in the West. Mane was
chosen because Patterson, as well as being a very important man, and therefore an
appropriate person to look after a foreigner and teach me the language, is also engaged
in translating the prayer book of the Anglican Church of Melanesia into Lavukaleve.
Most of my data consists of recorded stories, told by people from most of the villages of
the West Russells. I have about 60 such stories, in total around eight hours of speech.
The stories are traditional stories of the Lavukal people (for instance, origin myths,
many stories about giants and magical old ladies, stories about magical animals and so
on), life histories, stories about particular experiences (for instance getting married, an
exciting fishing adventure), history stories (for instance earthquakes and cyclones and
how various villages were started, how the Christian church came to the Russells), and
procedural texts explaining to me how to do things (for instance how to weave mats,
how to make traditional pudding, how to go kite-fishing).
Most of the stories in my corpus are told by men; it is very difficult for women to
overcome their shyness of the recording machine; but as people got to know me better, I
got more and more stories by women. The stories by women are all told by personal
friends in villages where I have spent some considerable time. In villages where I only
visited for a few days, I usually only got stories by men. The speakers range in age from
late teens to their seventies.
The stories were narrated as monologues, into the tape recorder, with me and usually
Patterson present, and, often, with a group of interested listeners also. Most people were
very nervous of the tape recorder, and a couple of people wrote their stories down first,
101 - I NTRODUCTIONthen read them into the machine. These stories were not used for anything involving
intonation.
The corpus also consists of some thousands of sentences written down by me, either
elicited, or heard in conversation, or explicitly taught to me. There is also PattersonÕs
translation of parts of the prayer book of the Church of Melanesia.
All the stories were transcribed by Patterson and me, and have been checked at least
three times. Elicited sentences also were checked when they were written down.
PattersonÕs prayer service translations have been checked extensively by him, and also
by both of us together.
Patterson acted as my main linguistic informant. We spoke Solomon Pijin for work
sessions. I was taught to speak Lavukaleve by everyone I interacted with, which was
mostly Patterson and his wife Monica, my neighbour Emily, my friend Marion, as well
as most of the Mane children. Most of my interaction in the village was conducted in
Pijin initially, moving more to Lavukaleve as I learnt more. I am at best only a partial
speaker at this stage.
Most of my time was spent in Mane village, but I also stayed in most of the other
villages of the West Russells and collected data from nearly all of them. I have visited
some of the Eastern villages; notably Loun and Alokan, but I have no data from there.
For logistical reasons of transport difficulties, and also for political reasons to do with
my affiliation with PattersonÕs faction, I was able to spend very little time in the East.
For these reasons, my corpus consists entirely of the speech variety of the West
Russells.
1.7 TYPOLOGICAL OVERVIEW OF LAVUKALEVE
Lavukaleve has a medium-sized consonant phoneme inventory, with three places of
articulation for stops (b, t, k) and nasals (m, n, ng). There is a marginal voicing
distinction, in the two bilabial stops (p, b) and the two alveolar stops (t, d), but this
distinction pertains mostly to loan words. There are three fricative phonemes (f, s, h),
two approximants: a voiced velar approximant (g) and an unrounded bilabial
approximant (v), and one rhotic and one lateral. There is a five-vowel system (i, e, a, o,
u). Unusually for the region4 there is no contrasting series of oral versus prenasalised
stops (although prenasalised allophones of the voiced stops do exist). Syllables can be
open or closed, and consonant clusters consisting of two consonants, as well as
unlimited vowel sequences, occur frequently. Stress is unpredictable, although it most
commonly falls on the initial syllable of a word.
There are two major word classes in Lavukaleve: nouns and verbs. There are also a

"28211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSLavukaleve works exactly like accent prosody in English. In English predicate focus
constructions, there is an accent on the object. In Lavukaleve predicate focus
constructions, the focus marker agrees with the object. In English sentence focus
constructions, there is an accent on the subject, because sentence focus marking is in
paradigmatic opposition to predicate focus marking. In Lavukaleve sentence focus
constructions, the focus marker agrees with the subject. In both languages, sentence
focus marking operates in paradigmatic opposition to predicate focus marking.
11.7 THE THREE FOCUS MARKERS FEO, HEO AND MEO
The three focus markers are associated with different sentence types. In the next sections
the three focus markers will be discussed and exemplified. All three of the focus markers
are used in the constructions described above, expressing predicate, sentence and
argument focus.
THE MEO FOCUS MARKERMeo is used only in polar questions. It agrees in person, number and gender with the
questioned element:

the other is to express strong emphasis. There are some syntactic environments which
require the use of heo. These environments are: content questions, the second focus
marker of a focus-echo construction, focus clauses which contain a foia demonstrative
pronoun, and focus clauses in which a constituent is emphasised using the emphatic
particle ta. In these environments, if any focus marker is used it must be heo rather than
meo or feo. In other environments, heo may be used to express strong emphasis. This
is particularly the case with contrastive emphasis, which is almost always expressed using
heo. For this pragmatic purpose, feo may be always used instead of heo, but if it is, the
strong emphasis reading associated with heo will be lost.
·Content questionsHeo contrasts with meo in that while they are both used to form questions, meo is only
used in polar questions and heo is only used in content questions. Compare the two
focus markers in the example below, which is taken from natural conversation. The

sentence. This kind of construction is only possible for at most one core argument, and (it
seems) any number of adjuncts or non-main verbs.
In Lavukaleve, then, it is possible to pile up focussed element after focussed element. In
languages with grammatical focus marking, it is common for only one instance of this to
be allowed per sentence. Lambrecht (1994: 237-8) notes that English does not allow more
than one grammatically focus-marked (i.e. clefted) element in a sentence. There is a basic
principle which many languages follow, which limits the amount of focussed information
which can appear in one sentence. Giv—n (1975) argues, from comparison of focus
constructions in Bemba, Rwanda and Zulu, that Òthere exists a strategy of information
processing in language such that the amount of new information per a certain unit of
27811 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSmessage-transaction is restricted in a fashion Ñ say Ôone unit per propositionÕ Ó (p. 202,
his emphasis). Pawley and Syder (1977; 1983) make a similar point with their Òoneclause-at-a-timeÓ hypothesis. Du Bois (1987: 826), on this topic, formulates a ÒOne New
Argument constraintÓ, which says that speakers prefer to introduce a maximum of one
new argument per clause. He explains this in terms of a processing limitation: ÒNew
(previously inactive) information appears to be more difficult to process, and hence most
subject to constraintÓ (Du Bois 1987: 846).
However languages with focus marked by accent prosody generally tend to allow more
than one focussed item per sentence, but still only one per intonation unit. ChafeÕs (1987:
31-32; 1994) proposal of a Òone new concept at a time constraintÓ, specifies that only one
piece of new information occurs within one intonation unit, not within one clause or
proposition or sentence. English, for instance, does allow more than one focussed
element marked by pitch accent per sentence, but only one per intonation unit (Chafe
1994: 108-119).
The issue revolves around what a language takes as the relevant domain for the purposes
of focus marking. For English, the relevant domain over which focus marking by
prosody can apply is the intonation unit; whereas the domain over which grammatical
focus marking by clefts can apply is the sentence. For Lavukaleve, the relevant domain
over which grammatical focus marking can apply is not one sentence; there is no
constraint that only one element can be focussed per sentence. Instead, the rule seems to
be that only one core NP, plus any number of adjuncts, can receive argument focus per
sentence.
This is not a unique feature of Lavukaleve. Some other languages which have
grammaticalised focus marking allow more than instance of focus per sentence. For
instance Yukagir marks focus of a core argument by suffixation on the verb and the
relevant NP (Fortescue 1996). It also marks focus on adjuncts by postposing the adjunct.
It is possible to have focus on both a core argument and an adjunct in the same sentence,
using both the suffixation and postposing methods. It is not, however, possible, to focus
on two core arguments in one sentence, or, as I understand it, on two adjuncts in one
sentence. Yukagir is slightly different from Lavukaleve in that it uses two entirely
different strategies to mark different kinds of focus in one sentence, but nonetheless the
pragmatic fact of multiple-focus marking is comparable to Lavukaleve.
Roviana, an Oceanic language spoken on islands adjacent to the Russells, marks focus
using a special set of focal pronouns (Corston 1996). These have not been described in
detail, and it is not completely certain from the description that they are indeed marking
focus rather than, say, emphasis, but there are examples in CorstonÕs work of more than
one of these being used, with different reference, within a single sentence. If they are
focus pronouns then they are an example from a language close to Lavukaleve of
multiple-focus marking in one sentence.","[303, 304, 305]"

There are four suffixes applicable to deictics. Three of these, the Group, Presentative
and Predicative suffixes can only apply to deictics. Each suffix applies to just a subset
of all deictics. The morphology is set out here, together with an indication of which
deictics it can occur with. The rest of this section describes each suffix in more detail:

first and second person pronouns, as well as on foia/hoia/oia stems, to indicate that the
referents of the word are viewed by the speaker as a unified group. They are only used
with reference to humans. The -ha suffix marks a group consisting only of feminine
1858 - D EICTICSreferents, and the -sa suffix marks a group irrespective of the gender of its members:
that is, a group marked by -sa can consist either of only masculine referents, or of
masculine and feminine referents, or of only feminine referents. The feminine Group
suffix -ha is much less common then the non-gendered suffix -sa. The suffixes are
optional, and indeed occur only rarely. The Group suffix -sa has also been found on the
particle bae~bai ÔletÕs goÕ. Some examples of the Group suffixes:

Ôhere/there/there, farÕ (but not hoaka Ôthere, far unspecifiedÕ); koka~oka ÔfarÕ; ika
ÔthereÕ and the demonstrative modifier hoia ÔthisÕ. Added to hoia ÔthisÕ it creates a word
meaning Ôthis wayÕ. Added to hoka/hoika/heaka, ika and koka~oka, it creates a word
meaning Ôfrom here/there/ etc.Õ. In other words, it indicates that the reference of the
deictic is not a single point, as it usually is, but an extended range. It only occurs on
deictics used in clauses with motion predicates. The name ÔextendedÕ is taken from the
literature on Inuktitut (see e.g. Denny 1982: 360), where the term exists in opposition to
ÔnonextendedÕ, or ÔrestrictedÕ, and refers to Òstretches or areas of spaceÓ rather than
things located on one spot.
This suffix is also used on the interrogative ria ÔwhereÕ to express a similar meaning
(see Section 17.1.4); and on verbs, to indicate that the action is carried out all over the
place, or again and again, that is, iteratively or distributively. See Section 12.4.5 for a
discussion of its use with verbs.

rk1 0898.10.3 THE PRESENTATIVE SUFFIX -RI AND THE PREDICATIVE SUFFIXES -O/-OM/-VThe Presentative suffix -ri appears on demonstratives hoia ÔthisÕ and oia Ôthe otherÕ
(although not on foia ÔsheÕ); and on the locative deictics hoka/hoika/heaka
Ôhere/there/there farÕ; aka Ôthen, so, etc.Õ, ika ÔthereÕ and igala ÔthereÕ. The Presentative
suffix itself can be followed by the gender-marked Predicative suffixes -o (feminine)
and -om (masculine/neuter). These suffixes derive predicative deictics from -ri forms.
First the meaning of the Presentative suffix will be examined; after this is a discussion
of the gender-marked Predicative suffixes.
The Presentative suffix -ri derives a presentative form of a deictic, something like the
French voilˆ. Presentatives also occur in languages closer to the Solomons, for example
in Maybrat, a West Papuan Phylum language (Dol 1998). Presentatives are described by
Anderson and Keenan as demonstratives Òwhich are used to indicate an itemÕs location
or to signal its appearance in (or relative to) the observational field of the Sp[eaker]Ó
1888 - D EICTICS(1985: 279). FillmoreÕs Sentential Demonstrative is essentially the same phenomenon as
what is here described as a presentative demonstrative:
A Sentential Demonstrative ... is a demonstrative that can stand alone as a sentence,
having what can be called a Presentative function. These are sentences whose meanings
are something like ÔBehold!Õ or maybe ÔLook at this!Õ. Latin ecce, French voilˆ, SerboCroatian evo, are examples of Sentential Demonstratives. Often a noun or pronoun
indicating the object being presented occurs in construction with a Sentential
Demonstrative, as in French Le voilˆ, Serbo-Croatian Evo ga, both meaning ÔHere he
isÕ. (1982: 47)This is the most common pragmatic function of LavukaleveÕs Presentative suffix 4.
There are a couple of other related functions associated with this suffix. If a deictic is
used on its own as a single-word utterance, as, for instance, the answer to a question
where? or how?, it must appear with the Presentative suffix. For example, in showing
someone how to do something, an action will be accompanied by the single-word
utterance:

sentence; this sentence may be verbal or non-verbal.
Verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions take the form of a transitive or intransitive
clause, with whatever that entails, followed by a focus marker. The one specific
requirement is that the predicate (verb or Habitual Auxiliary) of a verbal Sentence-Final
focus construction must appear with the Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10), agreeing
with the focus marker. Rarely, a plural Agreement Suffix may be omitted. This is not
completely ungrammatical, but it is not considered good Lavukaleve (see Section 10.3.1).
For non-verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions, it is the same except that as there is no
verb or Habitual Auxiliary, there is no Agreement Suffix.
The role of the focus marker in Sentence-Final focus constructions is to mark the
construction as having focus. These construction types can involve one of two types of
focus; either focus on the predicate or focus on the whole sentence. It is the agreement of
the focus marker that indicates which kind of focus is intended.
25611 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSIt is easiest to see the difference between sentence focus and predicate focus in transitive
sentences, so transitive focus constructions will be discussed first.
Sentence-Final focus constructions in Lavukaleve in which the focus marker agrees with
the object NP (or complement of a non-verbal clause) involve predicate focus. The focus
domain extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to the object NP which
appears before the verb; for the purposes of focus marking this domain of verb plus
object is called a predicate here, following Lambrecht. (Recall that Lavukaleve has fixed
constituent order of S(O)V.) Predicate focus is the most usual, frequent, and
pragmatically unmarked type of grammatically marked focus.
For sentence focus, the focus marker agrees with the subject NP, the first core element of
a sentence. Thus the signal is that the focus extends from the focus marker at the end of
the sentence through to the beginning of the sentence. The focus domain is the sentence.
Sentence focus is much less frequent, and is pragmatically much more marked, than
predicate focus.
The subjects and objects of such sentences do not have to be expressed by full NPs; it is
the verb agreement which shows the scope of focus, and even if the overt NPs are
ellipsed, the verb agreement still tracks the scope intended.
PREDICATE FOCUS IN TRANSITIVE SENTENCESThe following examples show predicate focus sentences with the focus marker agreeing
with the object argument. In the first example, an older brother is jealous of his younger
brother, who has gone away and come back with a beautiful young wife. In this sentence,
he asks how the younger boy came to get this lovely wife:
17)(""Hey! Where did you get this woman from? "")

ke
EMPH
co 148The focus is not just on the woman, but rather on the whole act of taking the woman;
thus, it is on not just the object but the on verb as well as the object.
In the next example from the same story, the older brother has gone out and got his own
wife, after following his younger brotherÕs directions. However he followed the
directions rather poorly, and ended up with an old ugly wife instead, who he mistreats. In
this sentence, his mother is criticising him for mistreating his wife, saying in effect that he
only has himself to blame:25711 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS

Later in the same story, the younger brother finds out his older brother tried to have sex
with his, the younger brotherÕs, wife while he was away. He wants to kill his older
brother, but his wife dissuades him, suggesting instead they go back to live with her
parents, and thus get away entirely from the elder brother. The younger brother wonÕt do
this; as he explains, it would be humiliating to take her back, after having stolen her in the
first place:

he says, she must obey him. Note the object NP is this case is a relative clause, the head

own.
The form and functions of the Habitual Auxiliary are discussed in Section 14.3.
3.9 POSTPOSITIONS
Postpositions are a small class of words. Their defining features are:

can occur with the Locative suffix. Postpositions and postpositional phrases are
discussed in Section 7.1. Note there is a conjunction ne ÔandÕ, formally identical to ne
ÔwithÕ (see Section 3.10).
3.10 CONJUNCTIONS
There are seven conjunctions in Lavukaleve: aka Ôand, so thenÕ; taman ÔhoweverÕ; leta
ÔbutÕ; o Ôand, orÕ; olang ÔbecauseÕ; ve ÔorÕ; ne ÔandÕ. The last can also function as a
postposition. Conjunctions share the following features:
573 - WORD C LASSES·
·they occur in between a pair of coordinated clauses or NPs
apart from aka, which can take the Presentative suffix -ri and Predicative -o/om/v,
they cannot take any morphological affixationThe use of conjunctions in conjoined clauses is mentioned in Section 15.4.6 and
discussed in Section 18.1.3. The Presentative and Predicative suffixes, and aka, are
discussed in Sections 8.9.4 and 8.10.3.
3.11 LOCATIONALS
Locationals are a loose, heterogeneous class of words that include the hoka ÔhereÕ
paradigm (including hoka ÔhereÕ; hoika Ôthere, medial; heaka Ôthere, distantÕ; hoaka
Ôthere; unspecified distanceÕ); ika ÔthereÕ, and koka~oka ÔfarÕ, all of which take
Presentative suffix -ri and Predicative -o/om/v, plus a number of other single
uninflecting words including uke ÔnearÕ; umu Ôunder, belowÕ; vuli ÔbehindÕ; fain Ôon
topÕ; fafaril ÔacrossÕ; sangine ÔtogetherÕ.
These words are grouped together not on morphological grounds; indeed they are
morphologically very varied. Rather they are grouped together on the semantic basis
that they provide locational specification to a clause. They function as adjuncts, having
scope over a whole clause. Some of these words can take the Presentative -ri,
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la. Their classification as locationals recognises the
fact that they form a semantic class. In strictly formal terms, different classes could be
recognised, based on whether or not they take either the Presentative -ri and Predicative
suffix -o/om/v (hoka, hoika, heaka, hoaka, aka, ika, koka and oka) and Extended -la
(the same group but without hoaka and aka). Those that do not would then be classified
as particles. However it seems descriptively more revealing to think about them in terms
of their semantic relationship to each other. In this way, members of the same semantic
set like uke ÔnearÕ (uninflecting) and koka~oka ÔfarÕ (taking Presentative -ri and
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la) do not have to be separated.
Those locationals which end in k a enter into certain formal and paradigmatic
relationships with each other, and with the demonstratives; these forms are discussed in
Sections 8.9 and 8.10, where there is also a discussion of the Presentative -ri and
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la.
3.12 NUN ÔFROMÕ
Nun ÔfromÕ is a locational particle which differs from the other locationals in that it
always occurs together with a nominal adjunct, immediately following it, and together
with this nominal adjunct it forms a complex locational adjunct. Nun is discussed in
Section 7.4.
583 - WORD C LASSES3.13 DEMONSTRATIVE IDENTIFIERS
There is a class of words which are formally related to the foia demonstrative pronoun,
with the addition of an extra syllable /hV/ after the first syllable of the pronoun, where
V takes its form from the vowel of the first syllable of the pronoun.
Demonstrative identifiers only occur in non-verbal clauses, functioning somewhat
similarly to predicative deictics. See Section 8.11 for a discussion of them, and a
comparison with predicative deictics.
3.14 ROI ~DOI ÔWHICH?Õ
There is a word roi~doi Ôwhich?Õ (the forms vary freely; see Section 2.10), a question
word, which forms its own word class, on the basis of its morpho-syntactic properties. It
functions as the head of an NP, so one might want to call it a noun, but there are two
reasons that this is not an appropriate classification. Firstly, it is a criterial feature of
nouns that they have their own inherent gender. Roi does not, but instead takes its
gender from the word whose status it is questioning. Secondly, it can appear in an NP in
apposition with, and before, this noun which it is questioning. Nouns do not do this; two
nouns in the same NP must normally appear in a head-modifier relationship, using the
possessive construction (see Section 4.2 for discussion of this). The fact that roi can
appear in apposition with a noun means that it is not a noun. The fact that it appears
before, not after, this noun, means that it could not possibly be modifying this noun;
modifiers invariably follow, not precede, their heads. For these reasons, roi is not
considered a noun or an adjective, but instead is considered to belong to its own word
class.
Other question words are discussed below, Section 3.17.2. Roi is discussed further,
along with other question words, in Section 17.1.4.
3.15 REFLEXIVE MUAN ÔSELF Õ
The reflexive word muan ÔselfÕ is in its own word class, as it has features unique to it. It
is obligatorily prefixed with a Possessive prefix, to indicate its referent. It may also be
preceded by an NP stating this referent. Verbal morphology cross-references the NP (or
the referent to which the Possessive prefix refers), not muan itself. Muan is not a noun,
as it has no gender, and does not function as the head of an NP, cannot be modified by a
demonstrative and cannot take the definite article, does not function as an argument, and
therefore it cannot be cross-referenced by a predicate. Muan is called a reflexive word,
because one of its functions is reflexive, but it also occurs to indicate that the actor did
the action alone, by themselves. In the following example, muan appears with a 1st
person singular Possessive prefix, and an NP consisting of the 1st person pronoun
593 - WORD C LASSESprecedes it. The verb cross-references the 1st singular subject:

3.16 VERB ADJUNCTS
There is a small closed class of verb adjuncts, consisting of only four words: fo'for Ôfly,
prepareÕ; ko'kor ÔtightÕ; so'sor ÔfastÕ and va'var ÔtalkingÕ.
Verb adjuncts only occur in construction with the verb hai ÔdoÕ; together the words
form a kind of complex predicate. They immediately precede hai. Nothing can
intervene between the verb adjunct and hai, and the verb adjunct cannot occur with any
other verb than hai.
It is easy to distinguish verb adjuncts from other word classes. They are not nominal
arguments, because they are never, under any circumstance, cross-referenced by the
verb. They are not verbs, because they never receive any verbal morphology; and in
addition, verbs are all vowel-final. They are different from particles, both in their fixed
position and in their reliance on the presence of hai ÔdoÕ. It is interesting to note the
formal relationship between the four verb adjuncts: they all end in /r/, and they look like
older reduplications; the non-initial stress pattern is also suggestive of this (see Section
2.7.1 for a discussion of the types of words which have non-initial stress). If they are old
reduplications, it is not at all clear what the unreduplicated words were, or what word
class they were. Interestingly, there is a noun va'var ÔtalkingÕ as well.
Note that borrowed verbs also function similarly to verb adjuncts, but in construction
with sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ rather than with hai. Verb adjunct constructions are
discussed in Section 14.4.
3.17 PARTICLES
There are a large number of particles in Lavukaleve; these words take no morphological
affixation, and do not occur in close construction with any other word or constituent.
They can be divided into smaller subclasses based on their scope across a constituent or
clause, and their semantics. Adverbial particles have scope over a clause or a single
verb. Hesitation and exclamation particles do not have scope. Other particles have scope
603 - WORD C LASSESover a whole clause. They all function syntactically as adjuncts.
3.17.1 A DVERBIAL PARTICLESThere are only ten adverbial particles in the corpus. Most verbal modification is done by
full verbal clauses rather than by adverbs. Adverbs are a subclass of particles which can
have scope over a single verb (although this is not always the case; they can also have
scope over an entire clause). They are all manner adverbs. As there are so few, it is
worth giving an exhaustive list, although there are probably more in the language than
occur in the corpus collected so far.

Adverbial particles generally immediately precede the verb which they modify,
although this is not obligatory. As adverbs are not discussed elsewhere in the thesis, it is
worthwhile to show some examples here:

verbs using the suffix -ril. This is discussed in Section 13.2.3.","[82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87]"
"At the morphological level, then, in main clauses Lavukaleve treats NPs in A and S
function alike, and those in O function differently.
Semantic roles associated with the grammatical relation of subject in Lavukaleve
include agent (e.g. kuru ÔkillÕ), experiencer (e.g. le ÔseeÕ), patient (e.g. kiu ÔdieÕ) and
possessor (e.g. nuve ÔownÕ).
OBJECTSAs there are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve, it is no difficult matter to establish
2099 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREwhich NPs have the grammatical relation of object. For Lavukaleve, any core syntactic
function which is not an A or an S is an O; any grammatical relation which is not a
subject is an object. The morphological and syntactic criteria adduced above for the
justification of the subject relation work also, in converse, for the justification of an
object relation.
Many languages of the world allow at least a few ditransitive verbs. Lavukaleve,
however, does not. Typically ditransitive verbs such as ÔgiveÕ, ÔshowÕ and ÔtellÕ are
transitive verbs in Lavukaleve. They have two core arguments, and an optional
postpositional argument.
For example ne ÔgiveÕ is subcategorised for a subject and an object, which express the
giver and the gift, respectively, and optionally takes a postpositional phrase to express
the recipient. In the following example, the giver is ÔsheÕ, expressed as the 3sgS prefix
on eonege; the gift is Ôit (the food)Õ, expressed as the 3sgnO prefix on the same verb;
and the recipient is Ôher husbandÕ, expressed in the postpositional phrase Ôto her
husbandÕ (otum na ana):

jn 089One would not want to call the speech here a paratactic complement along the lines of
Noonan (1985, sp. 55 ff.). The speech is not syntactically linked in any way to the
clause which contains the verb of speech.
Thus, other possible candidates for the object grammatical relation are easily
distinguished from objects.
Semantic roles associated with the grammatical relation of object in Lavukaleve include
patient (e.g. kuru ÔhitÕ) and theme (e.g. le ÔseeÕ), and also the gift of ne ÔgiveÕ, and the
recipient of tai ÔtellÕ.
2119 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURE9.4 CORE AND OBLIQUE FUNCTIONS
Core functions are, according to Andrews (1985: 81) Òby definition A, S and O, and
whatever other grammatical functions are sufficiently like them to be plausibly grouped
with them and opposed to the others, which are the oblique functionsÓ. For Lavukaleve,
the core/oblique distinction is a simple one: subject and object are core; everything else
is oblique.
9.4.1 OBLIQUE FUNCTIONSNPs in Lavukaleve which are not subjects or objects are all oblique, and come under the
general term used in this thesis: adjuncts. Adjuncts are by definition not part of the
obligatory elements of a clause. They come in a variety of forms and functions.
Adjuncts encompass semantic roles such as instrument, location, time, goal, source, and
so on. There are three types of adjuncts involving nominals (all discussed in Chapter 7):
postpositional phrases; locational nouns with the Locative or Perlative suffixes; and
place nouns. Place nouns, a very restricted set of nouns, are the only nouns which can
function as adjuncts with no affixation or postposition to show their role. The following
examples show, respectively, a postpositional phrase, a locational noun with the
Locative suffix; and a place noun:

NPs, or both, or neither. Verbal affixes include the pronominal subject and object
prefixes; the Agreement Suffix; and the Present Tense suffixes. Examples of each of
these possibilities follows.","[235, 236, 237, 238]"
"1286 - GENDER AND AGREEMENT
HOMONYMSThere are many homonyms in Lavukaleve, and it is interesting to note that in some
cases they take the same gender, but in other cases their genders differ. Thus:

Ôrumble, as of thunderÕ (f)
Ôfleet of canoesÕ (m)
ÔstarfishÕ (m)

ÔmotherÕ (f)
ÔcollarboneÕ (n)The closer semantically the words are, the more likely they are to have the same
genders. This is natural; some of these words are clearly chance homonyms, whereas
others are really the same word. So for example hai meaning Ôpoint, promontoryÕ is
probably the same word as hai meaning ÔforeheadÕ, and they have the same gender; but
probably kala meaning ÔmotherÕ is a chance homonym with kala meaning ÔcollarboneÕ,
and they have different genders.
E XPLOITATION OF GENDER FOR SEMANTIC PURPOSESIn most cases, gender is a fixed feature of a noun, but it is possible in Lavukaleve,
though rare, for the gender of a noun to be changed for semantic purposes. There are a
few instances in the corpus of a masculine or neuter noun being treated as a feminine
noun, to express the fact that it is very small. Consider the following examples:

as it normally does. However in the second example, foe is feminine. This is a device
deliberately exploited by the speaker for a particular semantic purpose. The speaker has
just asked the evil giant if he could use the giantÕs fire. He wants to cook a pig he has
just caught, but he doesnÕt want to tell the giant that, because he knows the giant will
take the pig from him if he knows about it. He is eventually forced to admit to the giant
that he wants the fire to cook the pig on it, but he tries to claim that the pig is only very
small, and thus not worth the giantÕs attention. To emphasise the tiny size of the pig, the
speaker uses feminine agreement instead of the usual masculine. The next pair of
examples shows a similar situation:

co 016The first of the above examples shows mola ÔcanoeÕ acting in its normal way as a
neuter noun, taking neuter agreement. In the second example, however, it takes
feminine agreement. The speaker deliberately uses feminine agreement to emphasise the
smallness of the canoe in this situation. It is not possible treat a non-masculine or nonneuter noun as masculine or neuter to make a particular point; nor indeed is it clear what
the point made could be.
Note that it is not obvious from the corpus of feminine nouns that small things are
associated with feminine gender, but the above examples do show this association being
made morphologically, even if it is not clear in the lexicon of the language.
6.2 AGREEMENT
Gender is expressed in Lavukaleve primarily through agreement, not through the form
of the noun itself, despite the importance of phonological form of the noun for gender
assignment. Almost all nominal modifiers agree with their head nouns; that is, the
definite article, adjectives, demonstrative modifiers and the focus markers. Also
demonstrative pronouns show gender agreement. Further, some elements agree with
1306 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTnouns across the clause. Verbal prefixes which cross-reference objects (but not those
which cross-reference subjects) show gender agreement, as does the verbal Agreement
Suffix. Actually, all these elements show not just gender but also number agreement.
For most forms, gender and number are expressed together in portmanteau morphemes.
An example of this concordance shown in different word classes throughout the
sentence:
5)airaol
le'laol
airaol

feol
ruia
-ol
feol
old.woman -du.f 3dufFOC...two old women live there.leiaol.
lei
-aol
exist -du.f
co 033Throughout the language, however, all gender distinctions are shown only in the
singular and dual numbers; plural forms never express gender. This is true not just of
morphological affixes and grammatical words, but also of many lexical items (e.g.
vo'vou Ôboy childÕ, vo'voul Ôtwo boysÕ; vo'vo Ôgirl childÕ, vo'vol Ôtwo girls; tulav
Ôchildren (either/both sexes)Õ). That is, there is a syncretism of the three genders in the
plural number. This collapse of gender distinctions in the plural number is the kind of
syncretism which Corbett (1991: 190 ff.) calls convergence, and is a relatively common
phenomenon in the languages of the world. The only thing perhaps slightly less
common is the fact that gender distinctions are maintained throughout the dual number,
and converge only in the plural.
Having stated what kinds of elements must agree, it should be noted that there are some
instances of these elements in Lavukaleve which cannot show gender agreement. There
are some lexical restrictions to the rule that all adjectives must always agree in gender
with their head noun: the adjective bakel ÔbigÕ does not show gender/number
agreement, and the numbers from three to ten, which are also adjectives, do not show
gender/number agreement. Otherwise, all those elements mentioned above that agree in
gender must always obligatorily show gender agreement. This is normally a
straightforward matter; however there is one word ruima Ôold manÕ which has
anomalous agreement properties. This word is the topic of the next section.
THE HYBRID NOUN RUIMA ÔOLD MANÕCorbett (1991: 183 ff.) defines hybrid nouns as those nouns which Òneither simply take
the agreement of one consistent agreement pattern nor belong to two or more gendersÓ.
There is one word in Lavukaleve like this: ruima Ôold manÕ. All nouns referring to
human males are masculine in gender, except for ruima. This word always takes a
feminine, not masculine, definite article:

use a combination of both, or use one gender for agreement, then repeat themselves

jt2 008jt2 050The anomalous agreement properties of ruima are due to the fact that it is assigned to
the feminine gender, even though it denotes a human male referent. Ruima is the only
word in Lavukaleve which behaves in this anomalous way with respect to its agreement
properties. Interestingly, the other human noun which could potentially have anomalous
agreement patterns is tu'tul ÔbabyÕ, which is neuter. However I have never observed
any anomalous agreement patterns associated with this word; it invariably takes neuter
agreement. Normally if speakers are discussing a particular baby they will refer to it
with a gendered noun, e.g. vo'vou ÔboyÕ or vo'vo ÔgirlÕ, instead of using tu'tul. Tu'tul
1326 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTis more usually used in the abstract, talking about non-particular cases; such cases are
easily compatible with neuter gender.
NON-PROTOTYPICAL CONTROLLERS AND DEFAULT AGREEMENTThe fact, stated above, that gender agreement is obligatory in all elements which are
able to show gender, presents problems occasionally. Corbett (1991: 203 ff.) discusses
the two types of problems typically associated with languages like Lavukaleve which
have so-called ÒenforcedÓ gender. The first problem arises when gender agreement
depends on a head which is not itself specified for gender. The second problem arises
when the speaker is unable to specify the gender of a referent. Lavukaleve deals with
the two problems in different ways.
In those cases in which gender agreement is controlled by an element which does not
have gender, Lavukaleve obligatorily uses 3rd person singular neuter agreement,
henceforth called Òdefault agreementÓ.
This kind of agreement can be seen for instance when the focus markers are in
construction with, and hence must agree with, an adjunct (first two examples) or a verb
(third example):

cannot sensibly be said to have scope. Some of the common ones include a, e, mi, i and
mina ÔumÕ. Mina is also a feminine noun meaning ÔthingÕ, but in its use as a hesitation
particle it appears in sentences not as an argument but rather as a filler, while the
speaker thinks of the word they want.
3.17.7 E XCLAMATION PARTICLESThere are quite a few exclamation particles, used to show instant reaction and emotion.
These words seem to be particularly sensitive to style; this is cross-linguistically
common. The following are some of the most common ones:
eseko
hapilo
e
eta
sala
tumai
sieÔwow! is it true?Õ (used by younger people)
Ôoh my goodness!Õ (used by older people)
Ôhey!Õ (used generally, to get someoneÕs attention)
Ôwow!Õ (exclamation of surprise, used generally)
Ôhey! stop that!Õ (exclamation of disapproval, used in admonishing young
children)
Ôreally! oh, right!Õ (used generally, as a response to information, or giving
feedback to a speaker as a way of eliciting more information)
Ôstop that!Õ (used only for admonishing dogs)3.17.8 RELATIONAL PARTICLESThe following are the most common relational particles: noka ÔevenÕ; tin ÔonlyÕ; hide
ÔthusÕ (used with quoted speech); koi Ôalso, tooÕ; ke ÔemphaticÕ (provides assertive
emphasis to a clause or constituent); vausa Ôfinished, enoughÕ (said at the end of a
story).","[88, 89]"

17.1.4 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING INTERROGATIVE LEXICAL ITEMSContent questions are often phrased in focus constructions using specific interrogative
lexical items. These interrogative words belong to various word classes, and thus have
different syntactic properties. The full list is as follows:

word of a clause. For instance, it cannot form a complex predicate with the Habitual
Auxiliary, and it does not take verbal morphology apart from the Agreement Suffix.

not with a verbal prefix (see Section 10.5). Some examples:

an NP. The expression of subject arguments by affixation is a matter of some
complexity; in some constructions subject affixes must appear, in some they cannot
appear, and in some they are optional. In coordinate-dependent clauses (see below,
Section 9.7.4 and Chapter 15), the subject cannot be expressed by an affix on the
predicate. In sentence-focus clauses a subject affix must appear on the predicate (see
Chapter 11.3.2). In adverbial subordinate-dependent clauses, subjects must be expressed
by affixation (but using a split-ergative marking system; see Section 16.1). In all other
cases, a subject affix may appear on the predicate, but it is optional. In all of these cases,
whether or not a subject affix appears on the predicate, an overt NP referring to the
subject may occur.
Core arguments, then, are most commonly expressed by verbal affixation, with,
optionally, an NP as well (see Section 18.2 for a discourse-based account of the
expression of arguments by NPs and affixation versus by affixation alone).
One could argue that the core arguments in Lavukaleve are the pronominal prefixes on
the predicate, not the overt NPs. Such an analysis would be by no means unique to
Lavukaleve; Foley (1986: 227-235) claims this for Yimas, and Van Valin and LaPolla
(1997: 33-34) for Lakhota. Van Valin and LaPolla point out in addition that the idea is
not new, citing von Humboldt (1836) as using this type of analysis for Classical Aztec
and Boas (1911) for Chinook.
2139 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREUnder this analysis, overt NPs, when they appear, are an optional elaboration of the
obligatory verbal affixes, and could be thought of in syntactic terms as being in an
appositional relationship to the pronominal affixes.
For Lavukaleve, one would have to account for the fact that there are circumstances in
which the subject affix (thus the expression of the core subject argument) is not allowed
to appear, but the NP referring to the subject can. This happens for instance in
coordinate-dependent clauses, where subject prefixes are incompatible with coordinatedependent verbs (see below, Section 9.7.4 and Chapter 15 for discussion of these). If
pronominal prefixes are the core arguments, and NPs are paratactic adjuncts to these, it
is difficult to understand the syntactic status of NPs when there is no verbal affix.
FoleyÕs (1991) response to a similar question in Yimas (in situations where a
pronominal prefix does not occur but an NP does) is to argue that there is in fact a zero
pronominal prefix there, holding the core argument slot. However I am reluctant to posit
zero pronominal prefixes where there is no direct evidence for them.
A second caveat to an argument for the core status of pronominal affixes versus NPs, is
as follows. The term used above, Ôpronominal affixesÕ includes the verbal prefixes on
predicates, Habitual Auxiliary prefixes, Present Tense suffixes, Imperative suffixes and
the Agreement Suffix (see Section 9.7 below). However there is a problem. Whereas the
pronominal prefixes only ever express subject and object, the two arguments that one
would want to call core in Lavukaleve, the Agreement Suffix can agree with not only
subject or object, but also oblique arguments such as postpositional objects, in focus
constructions and relative clauses. One would not want to call such arguments core,
simply because they can, in certain specific circumstances, be marked by the Agreement
Suffix.
There is a third major problem, related to the same issue of the morphological material
available to mark arguments. Although one could think of the verbal and Habitual
Auxiliary prefixes as arguments (in that they mark person, gender, number and
grammatical function), and possibly one could think of the Present Tense suffixes
(which mark Present Tense, and number of the subject) and Imperative suffixes (which
mark one of two types of Imperative mood, and number of the subject) in the same way,
it is much harder to think of members of the Agreement Suffix paradigm as arguments.
The Agreement Suffix forms only mark gender and number, and make no reference to
other important categories of referents, such as person or grammatical function. The
case for the core argument status of the Agreement Suffix would be very hard to
sustain.
None of these problems are fatal to an analysis of verbal affixes as core arguments and
NPs as paratactic adjuncts to these. However there is a certain counter-intuitiveness to
such an argument; and it requires positing zero affixes in places where there is no direct
2149 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREevidence for them. Perhaps a simpler and more intuitive account is that verbal affixes
and NPs together express core arguments. Different combinations of these exist to
express different pragmatic meanings.
Throughout this thesis, I refer to the pronominal prefixes as Ôcross-referencing prefixesÕ.
This should not be taken to mean that the NPs are syntactically prior in any way.
9.5 CLAUSE TYPES
Clauses in Lavukaleve divide into two major types: independent (main) and dependent.
Dependent clauses themselves are of two types: subordinate-dependent and coordinatedependent. The following diagram outlines types of clauses in Lavukaleve:
clause types
independentadverbialdependentsubordinatecoordinatepurposiverelativeMy terminology follows that of Foley (1986) in describing Iatmul, which (like many
Papuan languages) shares with Lavukaleve certain fundamental features in its clause
linking strategies. Foley argues for a distinction between main, subordinate-dependent
and coordinate-dependent verbs, defining subordinate verbs in the following way:
The subordinate clause functions like a part of the main clause, and this relation of a
part within the whole, or embeddedness, is how I will define subordination. Verbs of
such subordinate clauses, although fully specified in Iatmul for status and for person
and number of the actor, are necessarily linked to a main clause, and are therefore not
independent. I will refer to such verbs of subordinate clauses as 'subordinate-dependent'
and fully inflected verbs of main clauses as 'independent'. (1986: 177)and coordinate-dependent clauses as follows:
...clauses containing [coordinate-dependent] verbs are not considered subordinate. They
do not function as arguments of some main clause. They do not function as embedded
parts within a whole, but are linked to a fully inflected verb in a linear string, much like
beads on a necklace. Because the linking of the clauses is at the same structural level,
rather than as part within whole, I regard such clauses as coordinate and verbs of such
clauses as 'coordinate-dependent'. (1986: 177)2159 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREThis classification is particularly revealing for Lavukaleve. The classification of
LavukaleveÕs clauses, with morpho-syntactic criteria, is as follows:
MAIN (INDEPENDENT) CLAUSES·
·
·can stand on their own as a complete sentence
mark their own core participants using pronominal affixation on the predicate
specify their own TAMSUBORDINATE-DEPENDENT CLAUSES·
·
·are embedded (have a part-whole relationship with main clauses)
function as modifiers of main clauses
mark their own core participants (some types using a split-ergative system) on the
predicateCOORDINATE-DEPENDENT CLAUSES·
·are syntactically and semantically dependent on a main clause, but are not
syntactically or semantically a part of that clause
do not mark their own subject participants (but do mark their objects)Since in Lavukaleve clauses are headed by and are often coextensive with predicates,
the classification holds both for clauses and predicates. Some examples of these three
types follow:

viable syntactic unit, provides its own specification for subject, and also object, it has
the Future tense marked on it, and has an adjunct, the postposition ona.

adverbial clause, modifying the main clause oina fiata la one fufum. It is marked with
the Anterior suffix, which indicates that the clause means Ôupon V happeningÕ. That is,
it provides a temporal starting point for the action of the main verb. The subject
participant ÔtheyÕ is expressed on the subordinate verb by means of the prefix vo(intransitive third person subjects of adverbial subordinate verbs are marked
2169 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREmorphologically as objects; see Section 16.1 for more on this).

-NFmn3 062The example above shows three coordinate-dependent clauses (with verbs lomare,
lofoure and ririgoiare). Each is dependent for the interpretation of their subject
reference on the final verb olei. As it happens, no TAM is marked on the main
(independent) verb, but the time reference of the coordinate-dependent clauses is
assumed to be that of the main (independent) clause. The verbs of all three coordinatedependent clauses are overtly marked as such, with the Non-Finite suffix -re. The
relationship between the coordinate-dependent clauses and the independent clause is
one of temporal succession. Fuller discussion of each of these clause types appears in
Chapter 15.
9.6 PREDICATE TYPES IN LAVUKALEVE
A predicate is the head of a clause, the element which takes arguments and which
carries pronominal affixation, in appropriate clause types, for at least one core
argument. The following predicate types exist in Lavukaleve:
·
·
·
·
·
·Simple verbs
Serial verbs in serial verb constructions and verb compounds
Habitual Auxiliary verbal complexes
Predicates formed with verbal adjuncts
Non-verbal predicates
Deictic predicates9.6.1 S IMPLE VERB PREDICATESSimple verb predicates consist of a single lexical verb. The verb may be transitive or
intransitive, and carries the participant marking appropriate for the clause type, and
TAM specifications of the clause in which the predicate appears. In the following
example, there are two simple verb predicates. The first is a transitive verb ho, marking
its object argument by affixation, and functioning as the head of a coordinate-dependent
clause (see above); and therefore not marking its subject argument by affixation. The
second simple verb predicate is the intransitive verb iru, marking its subject argument2179 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREand functioning as the head of a main clause.

3plS- sleep-re

structurally they consist of two or more lexical verbs which together act as a single unit
in terms of taking subject arguments and TAM specifications. Serial verb constructions
share their subject arguments, and if there is more than one transitive verb in the
construction, these share their object arguments. Verb compounds consist of two verbs
in juxtaposition functioning in every respect as a single predicate. The two constructions
differ in that every transitive verb of a serial verb construction must prefix its object,
whereas the entire verb compound only prefixes its object once.
Some examples of subject and object marking in serial verb constructions and verb
compounds follow. See Section 14.1 for a much fuller justification and discussion of
these constructions.

9.6.3 HABITUAL A UXILIARY VERBAL COMPLEXESVerbal complexes consist of a lexical verb in construction with the Habitual Auxiliary
(see Section 14.3 for discussion). The members of the verbal complex function as a
single predicate. They share their arguments, and participant marking is shared between
them, in a very particular way. The Habitual Auxiliary can only ever mark the subject
(S/A), never the object, argument (with one exception, in focus constructions, see below
Section 9.7.2, and Chapter 11). Note however that in subordinate constructions the
Habitual Auxiliary, like intransitive verbs, uses object prefixes to cross-reference the
subject argument in the third person, in what is essentially a split-ergative marking
system. This is discussed in Section 16.1. The verb can only cross-reference the object,
if it is transitive, never the subject. The auxiliary can use either a special subject prefix,
or else the Agreement Suffix, to cross-reference the subject. The following are
examples of these verbal complexes:
Intransitive:
35)Vala!

36)aluluri
a3sgmO-lulu
-ri
straight -CAUSleme.
le1plex-me
HAB...we sort it outao 013In each of the above examples, the Habitual Auxiliary me immediately follows a verb,
and, together with that verb, forms the predicate of the clause. There is a subject prefix
or suffix on me, and, if the verbal complex is transitive there is an object prefix on the
verb. Verbal complexes take their valency from the verb of the complex; me is not a
verb and has no valency.
9.6.4 P REDICATES FORMED WITH VERBAL ADJUNCTSComplex predicates formed with Verbal Adjuncts consist of two parts; the adjunct
expresses the lexical meaning of the predicate and takes no morphology, and it occurs
with a semantically rather empty verb, either hai ÔdoÕ or sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ
(always glossed ÔdoÕ), which takes any appropriate verbal morphology. Verb adjuncts
are a small closed class. Those which occur with sia are mostly loan verbs, and the
construction is used mainly to enable these loan verbs to be used in Lavukaleve
sentences. Some examples:2199 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURE

9.6.5 NON-VERBAL PREDICATESNon-verbal clauses consist of a non-verbal predicate and its subject argument. These
subject arguments are different from the subjects of verbal clauses, which were defined
in terms of morphological tests (i.e. cross-referencing). Non-verbal subject arguments
can be defined as the other NP argument of a clause with a non-verbal predicate. The
non-verbal predicate can consist of an NP, or a particle (italicised in the following

-o (feminine singular), -om (masculine/neuter singular), and -v (plural), attached to the
deictic in combination with the Presentative suffix -ri. The Predicative suffixes derive a
predicate from an adverbial or adnominal modifier or a nominal head. Thus, the
demonstrative hoina ÔthisÕ becomes hoinari Ôthis oneÕ with the Presentative suffix, and
hoinariom ÔitÕs this oneÕ with the masculine/neuter singular Predicative suffix. Such
predicates are restricted syntactically in that they cannot take any verbal morphology,
and can only take one argument.

·verbal prefixes, indicating person and number of subject and person, number and
gender of object (discussed in this chapter)
the Agreement Suffix, marking gender and number of a core argument; which core

Chapter 11)
prefixes on the Habitual Auxiliary, marking person and number of subject (Section
14.3)
Present Tense agreement, indicating number of the subject (Section 12.2.2).
Imperative suffixes, indicating one of two types of Imperative mood, and number of
subject (Section 12. 4.2).","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"

Word classes
Word classes are recognised on the grounds of morphological possibilities and syntactic
distribution, combined with, in some cases, semantics. There are two large open word
classes in Lavukaleve: nouns and verbs. There are also a large number of medium-sized
to small closed classes. This chapter contains a justification of the classification of these
word classes. More details on each of them are found elsewhere in the thesis. However
some of the smaller classes which are not discussed elsewhere in the thesis are
described more fully in this chapter. Thus there is a description of the counting system,
and of some of the more commonly occurring particles.
The following word classes and subclasses must be recognised for Lavukaleve. They
will each be discussed in turn.

The class of nouns is an open class of words which share the following morphological
and syntactic features:
·
·
·
·they function as the heads of NPs
they have inherent gender
they can be modified by the demonstrative modifier
they can take the definite articleThere are three subclasses of nouns: common nouns (these include many of what are
traditionally termed proper names), locational nouns and place nouns. All of these have
the features outlined above. Locational nouns and place nouns differ from common
nouns in their ability to function as nominal adjuncts in a clause without appearing in a
postpositional phrase.
Locational nouns function as nominal adjuncts using the Locative suffix -n. Common
nouns are unable to take this suffix; instead, spatial relations involving common nouns
are expressed using postpositional phrases. There are only a small number of locational
nouns; it is a closed subclass of the open class of nouns. These include, for the most
part, nouns referring to places, positions, body parts and time.
423 - WORD C LASSESPlace nouns can function as nominal adjuncts with no morphological marking. All place
nouns are proper names, but not all proper names are place nouns; some are common
nouns, some are locational nouns.
Both locational nouns and place nouns can be modified by adjectives and
demonstratives, and they have inherent gender.
Nominal adjuncts, including those formed with common nouns in postpositional
phrases, with locational nouns using the Locative (and Perlative) suffixes, and with
place nouns are discussed in Chapter 7.
There are three genders in Lavukaleve: masculine, feminine and neuter, named for the
fact that in the masculine class belong (among other things) most nouns referring to
male people, in the feminine class belong (among other things) all nouns referring to
female people, and in the neuter class belong very few nouns referring to humans.
Nouns have a fixed gender, which controls agreement with its modifiers, and
throughout the clause. Note that there are a few nouns which are always plural. Because
plural nouns do not have gender, this means that, strictly speaking, there are some nouns
which do not have inherent gender. Such nouns are considered a special case of
common nouns; the phenomenon is more to do with morphological exigencies of
Lavukaleve than with the syntactic distribution of such words. The principles associated
with gender assignment are discussed in Chapter 6.
3.2 VERBS
Verbs have the following syntactic and morphological features:
·
·
·
·
·they function as argument-taking predicates
they can take subject prefixes, and object prefixes if transitive
they can take the Agreement Suffix to agree with their nominal arguments
they can take TAM suffixes
they can take the Nominaliser suffix -e ~ -i (they have to be nominalised in order to
function as head of an NP)
· they can take the Locativiser suffix -l
There are three subtypes of verbs, defined on the basis of their primary valency.
Intransitive verbs take only one argument (subject). Transitive verbs take two
arguments (subject and object). Ambitransitive verbs can take either one or two
arguments, with no overt valency-changing morpheme to mark the change of
transitivity (though the appearance of object affixation makes the transitivity clear).
There are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve (see Chapter 9.3.2 for argumentation for
this claim), and there are no verbs with zero valency. All verb stems are vowel-final.","[66, 67, 68, 69]"

Focus constructions
11.1 INTRODUCTION
There are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, functioning in a grammaticalised focus
system, which is a very prominent part of the language. Syntactically the focus markers
are independent words which occur in construction with the constituent immediately to
their left. This is often an NP, but can also be an adjunct, a dependent clause, a predicate
and its object or an entire sentence.
There are two constructions in which the focus markers take part: a Sentence-Final focus
construction, in which the focus marker is in construction with a predicate plus its object
or a sentence, and appears at the end of the sentence; and a Sentence-Internal focus
construction, in which the focus marker is in construction with a non-predicating
constituent, and appears sentence-internally. The focus marker expresses focus on the
constituent with which it is in construction. So Sentence-Final focus markers express
focus on either a sentence or a predicate plus its object; and Sentence-Internal focus
markers express focus on an argument, an adjunct, a non-main verb, and the first part of
a complex predicate. Constructions involving focus markers are extremely common in
Lavukaleve; focus markers occur in approximately 35% of all sentences in the corpus.
This chapter describes the morphological and syntactic features of the focus markers, the
syntactic constructions which they occur in, and the pragmatic functions of these
constructions. Section 11.2 describes the forms and syntax of the focus markers
themselves. The major part of the chapter (Section 11.3) describes the constructions in
which the focus markers occur. Section 11.3.2 describes in detail Sentence-Final focus
constructions. Section 11.3.3 describes Sentence-Internal focus constructions. Section
11.5 discusses those situations in which there is more than one focus marker in one
24711 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSsentence. Section 11.6.1 describes those situations in which there is no marked focus.
Section 11.6.2 shows that the focus markers are not copulas, although they share certain
functions which copulas have in some languages. Section 11.6.4 notes the functional
similarity between Lavukaleve focus constructions and English accent prosody. While the
beginning of Section 11.2 gives a brief outline of the difference between each of the three
focus markers, Section 11.7 describes each of them in detail. Section 11.8 is a brief
summary of the main features of the focus system in Lavukaleve.
Throughout this chapter I use the term ÔconstructionÕ in the sense of the correspondence
between a morpho-syntactic structure and its pragmatic/semantic functions. So Ôfocus
constructionsÕ are those constructions which have a particular morpho-syntactic structure,
and express a particular pragmatic meaning.
11.2 MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX OF THE FOCUS MARKERS
The focus markers are independent words which form their own word class. The three
focus markers each form a paradigm of suppletive forms marked for person, gender and
number. The three different focus markers are meo, heo and feo (cited throughout in
their 3rd person singular feminine form). Each one is used for a different sentence type.
Meo is used in polar questions. Heo is used in certain syntactic environments such as
information questions, or where there is a demonstrative pronoun foia in the clause, or as
the second focus marker in a focus-echo construction. Heo can also be used to express
strong emphasis; this use of heo rather than feo or meo is not obligatory (unlike the
others), but a pragmatic choice made by a speaker for a certain effect. The third focus
marker, feo, is the unmarked one; it has the widest distribution and the least constraints
on its use. It is used in all situations where grammatical focus is to be expressed, apart
from those using heo or meo. In this sense, feo can be viewed as the default focus
marker.
11.2.1 PARADIGMS OF THE FOCUS MARKERSThese three paradigms are identical but for the initial consonant:

The first and second person forms of these paradigms show close formal similarity with
the free pronouns, consisting of C(o) plus the pronoun form. There is also a slightly less
strong formal relationship with the demonstratives. See Sections 8.4.1, 8.5 and 8.7.1 for
the paradigms. Note also that, as well as having a formal relationship with
demonstratives, the focus markers have a certain functional overlap with them in some
contexts; this is discussed in Section 11.4.2.
11.2.2 SYNTACTIC STATUSThe focus markers occur following and in construction with predicates plus their objects,
sentences, and non-predicating constituents. In the first example below, a focus marker is
in construction with the second NP of a non-verbal clause, in the second with a temporal
adjunct, in the third with a non-main verb (in this case a coordinate-dependent verb in a
clause chain) and in the fourth with an intransitive predicate. Throughout this chapter the
focussed constituents are italicised in the Lavukaleve; and in the English translation the
focussed element is in bold; the rest of this chapter justifies the claims implicit in this.

The next example is taken from a story about a giant who tricks two boys into letting him
steal their pig. He offers to butcher it for them, and as he cuts it up, he throws away each
bit of meat into the river, saying it is not fit for eating, until there is no more edible meat
left. The two boys donÕt realise that the giant has previously tied a bag in the river
downstream, and thus all the discarded bits of pig meat are being collected safely in his
bag, while they themselves end up with nothing. In the sentence below, the giant has
thrown away all the flesh, and only the intestines are left. The speaker expresses this with
focus on giving the bad bits:

(verb plus object), not just on the object. If speakers wish to focus on an object argument,
they use a Sentence-Internal focus construction (described in Section 11.3.3), with a
focus marker in construction with the object, as in the following example. In this
example, the focus marker occrs immediately after the object, not after the verb, and the
verb does not have the Agreement Suffix agreeing with the object:

information, or is presentational. The following example is the opening sentence to a
story about the origins of the village Losiolen. The sentence focus is accounted for by the
presentational context.

fk 001Sentence focus is also used in situations where something happens counter to
expectations. In the next sentence the speaker has just been startled by an arrow landing
next to her with no warning, and then is further surprised to see the addressee, who had
sneaked up behind her. She asks the question, expressing surprise that the man in front of
her might own the arrow, although it is clear that she had no expectation of who the
owner is (so this isnÕt contrastive focus):

obey their chiefs, and contrasting that with the perceived disobedience in villages now.
He uses sentence focus in this sentence for a strong statement, that those people then
obeyed the chiefsÕ word, which makes an explicit contrast with the people of today. The
speaker is talking to an audience of younger people, and he is perhaps slightly defensively
making a strong point, using the marked sentence focus construction, to achieve this.

knew what clan people belonged to, and now; because knowing what clan you belong to
means, among other things, that you have the knowledge to fight about land ownership.","[284, 285, 286]"

ja 143At first sight these appear to be examples of an NP appearing after the verb, in
contradiction to the constituent-order generalisation made in Section 9.2 that constituent
order is SV/AOV. However, a better analysis is possible.
Firstly, the only NPs which can appear in this position are demonstrative modifiers. No
other NP types can do this. Secondly, the verb of such clauses always involves the
Agreement Suffix. Thirdly, the demonstrative and Agreement Suffix always agree. These
points suggest that the demonstrative in such constructions is in fact functioning as a
focus marker, in a Sentence-Final focus construction. There is some deep overlap
between focus markers and deictics, as evidenced by the relationship between f- and hstems in both demonstratives and focus markers (see Section 11.7.1), and in these
constructions it seems that the demonstrative is functioning as a focus marker.
Note that in such examples, the hoia demonstrative modifier is used. It is not possible for
a demonstrative pronoun (that is, a demonstrative from the foia or oia paradigms) to
occur in this function. Further, hoia cannot have a head in such situations:

3sgS- shoot -plfo'sal

MOD.MED.plWho shot these fish?e4 013bThe fact that hoia in these situations cannot take a head noun shows that it is indeed
acting in a manner very different from its normal syntactic function, and lends support to
the idea that it is functioning here as a focus marker rather than a demonstrative modifier.
11.5 MORE THAN ONE FOCUS MARKER IN ONE SENTENCE
It is very common in Lavukaleve for more than one focus marker to occur in one
sentence. There are two types of construction which need to be discussed in this respect.
27211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSFirstly, there are focus-echo constructions, in which there are two agreeing focus
markers, one focussing on an argument, and the other at the end of the sentence. The
second type, true multiple-focus sentences, contain more than one constituent in argument
focus.
11.5.1 FOCUS-ECHO CONSTRUCTIONSIn the focus-echo construction there are two agreeing focus markers. The second focus
marker must always agree with the first in gender and number, but not necessarily
person. The first is a Sentence-Internal focus marker, expressing focus on an NP
argument, and the second is a Sentence-Final focus marker. The verb appears with the
Agreement Suffix. The following pair of examples is repeated from above (45 and 46))
(in these two examples, italics only indicate the focus markers, not the domain of focus):

e3 021dThe first focus marker in each sentence expresses argument focus. To explain the second
focus marker in (68) one could say the second focus marker is agreeing with the object
NP, thus it is expressing predicate focus, and in (69) it is agreeing with the subject NP,
thus expressing sentence focus. There are major flaws with this line of argumentation
however.
Firstly, the shape of the second focus marker is entirely constrained. It must be from the
heo paradigm (see below, Section 11.7.1) and it must agree with the same entity that the
first focus marker agrees with. So, if the first focus marker agrees with the object NP, so
must the second focus marker; it cannot agree with the subject NP:

3sgfEFOCThat the agreement of the second focus marker is completely prescribed by the first focus
marker indicates that the second focus marker in these constructions has a different
function from the sentence-final focus markers of single-focus marker sentences. It
cannot distinguish between sentence or predicate focus, as the speaker cannot choose
which NP it should agree with.","[297, 298, 299]"

allow other sorts of clauses to occur between elements of the clause chain. In particular,
aspect-marked verbs, and subordinate clauses marking various types of TAM can occur
between elements of a clause chain. The following examples illustrate clauses occurring
between clauses in chaining constructions. The first of these shows a whole clause of
quoted speech intervening between coordinate-dependent and independent verbs in a

VERB CONSTRUCTIONS AND SUBORDINATE CLAUSESClause chaining constructions were described in the previous sections as being a
particular construction type involving one or more coordinate-dependent clauses, each
containing a predicate marked with particular morphology, followed by an independent
predicate, which finishes the sentence. This clause chaining construction type is only
one of many ways in Lavukaleve in which to join verbs and clauses; it is worthwhile to
look briefly at each of the other ways in turn, to show that each one is structurally easily
distinguishable from clause chaining constructions.
INDEPENDENT COORDINATE CONSTRUCTIONSTwo or more independent clauses can be joined by the use of a conjunction. There is a
small number of conjunctions in Lavukaleve, including aka Ôthen, soÕ; hano Ôthen,
after, finishedÕ; leta ÔbutÕ; olang ÔbecauseÕ. These conjunctions are listed in Section
3.10. Of concern here is the structural differences between clauses joined using such
conjunctions, and clause chains. The major difference is that all the clauses joined using
conjunctions are independent; that is, they can freely stand on their own as complete
utterances. In addition, they can take the full range of TAM and participant marking
morphology normally available to independent predicates (and, for the most part, not
37715 - CLAUSE C HAININGavailable to coordinate-dependent predicates). For example note the conjunction aka
ÔthenÕ joining the two sentences in square brackets (each one a clause chaining
construction):

co 172Independent coordinate constructions are not common in Lavukaleve. It is certainly not
the preferred way of joining clauses. Instead, speakers prefer to join clauses using
clause chaining constructions or subordinate constructions.
S ERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONSClause chaining constructions are structurally very different to serial verb constructions.
Serial verb constructions are a type of predicate; clause chaining constructions are a
type of sentence. Clause chaining constructions consist of one or more coordinatedependent clauses, which are dependent on a following independent clause. Serial verb
constructions, however, do not have this relationship of dependence; each verb of a
serial verb construction is structurally equivalent to each of the other verbs in the
construction.
Serial verb constructions (discussed in Section 14.1) consist of a sequence of verbs
which occupy a single predicate slot. Like in clause chaining constructions, each of the
verbs must cross-reference its own object, but, unlike in clause chaining constructions,
the verbs do not take any morphology to show what relationship they have to each
other. A serial verb construction can mark subject arguments and TAM distinctions, but
only once across the whole predicate. Coordinate-dependent verbs cannot mark subject
arguments or TAM distinctions at all. Serial verb constructions can in fact act as a
coordinate-dependent predicate as part of a clause chaining construction, as the
37815 - CLAUSE C HAININGfollowing example shows (see also many previous examples in this chapter, including
(1), (22) and (25)):

Firstly, subordinate clauses are embedded within their main (independent) clauses, and
function either as an argument or a modification of their main clause. Subordinate
relative and purposive clauses bear little structural relationship to coordinate-dependent
clauses, and are not considered further here.
Subordinate adverbial clauses have predicates which are specifically marked with
special morphology which shows their semantic and syntactic relationship to the
independent clause, by using one of the Anterior suffix -ge; the Potential suffix -le or
the Surprise suffix -meon (see Section 16.1). They differ morphologically from
coordinate-dependent clauses in that coordinate-dependent clauses can never under any
circumstances cross-reference their subjects, whereas subordinate adverbial clauses can.
Subordinate adverbial clauses, if intransitive, have their own system of participant
marking, whereby third person subjects are cross-referenced as objects, in a splitergative marking system, and a special prefix e- holds the place of the normal subject
prefix.
Subordinate adverbial clauses can in fact be used to modify coordinate-dependent
clauses in clause chaining constructions. For example consider the following:
30)Ngoanun

[lit: He was staying lying down, as his body started to get strong, then standing up, ... ] hr1 014In this sentence fragment (the end of the sentence wasnÕt included because it is very
long, and not to the point) the subordinate clause otin elaketeige Ôupon his body37915 - CLAUSE C HAININGrecoveringÕ modifies the coordinate-dependent clause sou falere Ôstanding upÕ; it
describes what the anterior conditions for the completion of the sou falere clause were.
Note that the first and second coordinate-dependent predicates in this fragment, foa
fufure Ôlying downÕ and sou falere Ôstanding upÕ, are serial verb constructions.
15.5 CLAUSE CHAINING IN OTHER PAPUAN LANGUAGES
One might not expect necessarily to find structural similarities between Lavukaleve and
other Papuan languages; the term Papuan, after all, simply means that the language in
question is from a certain region of the world and is not Austronesian. Nevertheless,
constructions very similar to the one described in this chapter are very characteristic of
mainland Papuan languages, and it is worthwhile to look at how LavukaleveÕs clause
chaining constructions compare with clause chaining constructions in other languages.
Such constructions are not at all characteristic of the Oceanic languages surrounding
Lavukaleve.
LavukaleveÕs clause chaining constructions are similar in most respects to the wellknown examples in other Papuan languages, for instance Hua (Haiman 1980) and Tauya
(MacDonald 1990). Foley (1986) in his discussion of clause chaining constructions
mentions the following features as typical of such constructions in Papuan languages.
Typically coordinate-dependent verbs in Papuan languages have no tense marking
(Foley 1986: 196), and in fact their inflections are normally stripped down, often
including only a linking morpheme to show that they are in a clause chaining
construction (1986: 180). Typically, the temporal relation between the coordinatedependent and final independent verbs is marked; thus coordinate-dependent verbs
often mark whether their action is simultaneous with or sequential to the independent
(final) verb (1986: 180). Often Papuan languages with clause chaining constructions
have a switch-reference system, or some other tracking mechanism to show whether the
actor of a coordinate-dependent verb is the same as or different to the actors of other
verbs in the sequence. Final independent verbs are fully inflected verbs which contain
all information regarding TAM and person marking.
In Lavukaleve the situation is quite similar. Coordinate-dependent predicates carry
object marking if transitive, and carry a suffix to show their temporal relationship with
the next clause. Independent predicates in Lavukaleve carry full participant marking.
One place in which Lavukaleve differs from many Papuan languages is that in
Lavukaleve there is no obligation for the predicates of clause chains to share their
subjects, or to mark whether or not the subjects are shared, so there is no need for a
switch-reference system or some other mechanism to do this. In this respect,
Lavukaleve is similar to Yimas, which does not have a switch-reference system, and
does not require clause chains to have the same subjects (Foley 1991: 446). Also,
Lavukaleve does not have the simultaneous/sequential distinction which many
languages with clause chains make.
380CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Subordinate clauses
It was shown in Section 9.5 that there is a major division in clause types in Lavukaleve,
between independent (main) and dependent clauses. Dependent clauses themselves are
of two types: coordinate-dependent and subordinate-dependent. Coordinate-dependent
clauses are discussed in the previous chapter, Chapter 15. Subordinate-dependent
clauses, henceforth to be called simply subordinate clauses, are discussed in this
chapter.
Lavukaleve has three types of subordinate clauses: adverbial clauses, purposive clauses
and relative clauses. There are three different types of adverbial clauses, all marked by
verbal suffixation, and by changes in participant marking of the predicate, involving a
split-ergative system with 3rd person subjects following an ergative/absolutive marking
pattern and 1st and 2nd person subjects following a nominative/accusative marking
pattern. Purposive clauses too are marked by verbal suffixation, but do not have a splitergative marking system. Lavukaleve has internal relative clauses. That is, the argument
shared between the relative clause and the main clause is syntactically a part of the
relative clause, not the main clause. The following table summarises the basic morphosyntactic information to be covered in this chapter:

functional domains of complement clauses in other languages. For example the
complement of wanting is usually expressed as a nominalised clause (see Section 13.1
for a discussion of nominalisation). Example (49) below shows another common
construction in this functional domain: in He told them to go the verb of telling is
expressed as a subordinate Anterior clause, dependent on the verb go; thus, Him telling
them, they went. By such means as these the functional domain often expressed by
complement clauses in other languages is expressed in Lavukaleve.
The three major subordinate clause types, while they are all subordinate clauses, differ
markedly in their morpho-syntactic characteristics, and in the semantic functions which
they serve to express. This chapter, then, falls into three separate parts: a discussion of
adverbial clauses is followed by a description of purposive clauses then relative clauses.
16.1 ADVERBIAL CLAUSES
Adverbial clauses are subordinate clauses which add temporal, spatial, and other types
of meanings to the main clause. There are three kinds in Lavukaleve: Potential clauses,
Anterior clauses, and Surprise clauses. Adverbial clauses are marked by two means:
firstly, there is a suffix on the predicate of the subordinate clause. The suffix, as well as
showing that the predicate is subordinate, indicates the semantic relationship of the
adverbial clause to the main clause. Secondly, these clauses are marked by a very
special sort of participant marking. In this participant marking system, the surface
marking of grammatical relations within the subordinate clause is altered such that in
intransitive clauses the logical intransitive subject is cross-referenced using an object
prefix, and an invariant prefix e- holds the second prefix position, the position normally
reserved for cross-referencing to the subject of a transitive verb. This pattern only
applies to third-person subjects; first and second person subjects are marked as in main
clauses. It also only applies to intransitive predicates; transitive predicates use normal
main-clause participant marking strategies.
The system of participant marking in these clause types is described in the first sections;
firstly for verbs, then for the Habitual Auxiliary. This is a rather complicated area of the
language, and takes quite some explanation. The actual clause types, Anterior, Potential
and Surprise, are discussed only after this preliminary material has been dealt with. It is
necessary to explain the participant marking first in order for the reader to be able to
understand the examples of these adverbial clauses, which is the main descriptive task
of this section.
As with coordinate-dependent clauses, subordinate clauses are marked by verbal
morphology. This means that there are no non-verbal subordinate predicates.","[401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408]"
