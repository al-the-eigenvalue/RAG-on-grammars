"412University of California Publications in Linguistics1 5.9. Negative Clauses
The primary method for negation in Yuki is the negation of the verb by the suffixation
of a negative morpheme -ṭan to the verb265. There is also a negative verb ṭal-, the use of
which is not fully understood. In connected speech, use of -ṭan is much more common
than ṭal-. In elicited speech, -ṭan is also more common, and ṭal- is almost never seen.
15.9.1. Negation using -ṭan
(60) and (61) are an elicited near minimal pair of negative and affirmative clauses.
These two clauses have different agent arguments, miˀ ‘you’ and ˀąp ‘I’, respectively.
The verbs in both clauses contain the same morphology, except for the presence of
negative -ṭan in (60).

in the negative clause (62) contains the negative suffix -ṭan, while the verb in the
affirmative clause (63) does not.

15.9.2. Negative Verb ṭal-The use of ṭal- is not fully understood. It appears as an independent verb with a
negative meaning akin to ‘to be not’ and also is found at the end of verbs, which are
translated with a negative meaning. ṭąl- also appears in the Yuki negative response to
polar questions: ṭąlk ‘no’ or ‘(it) is not’.
In (64) and (65), ṭal- is used as an independent verb. In each of its uses in these two
examples, it occurs in the same form, tąlṭilinik ‘do not let yourself, must not let
yourself’.

Prohibitives, or negative imperatives, are formed in a manner analogous to that used
for negative questions. To form a prohibitive, the negative -ṭan is added to the verb
along with imperative -a(ˀ). (73) and (74) contrast prohibitive and imperative

This section describes negation in Huchnom and Coast Yuki.
15.9.5.1. Huchnom
To the extent that it is understood, negation in Huchnom appears to function in much
the same way as in Yuki. A negative morpheme -t̯al is added to the verb in order to
negate it. The Huchnom negative -t̯ǝl appears similar in form to the Yuki negatives -ṭan
and ṭal-.
Contrast the negative sentences in (77) and (78) with the affirmative clause in (79).

15.9.5.2. Coast YukiA small number of minimal pairs show the contrast between negative and affirmative
clauses. It seems from these examples that Coast Yuki may have employed a different
method for negation than Yuki or Huchnom. Negative clauses begin with ˀi:ma- or ˀi:mi-Clause Structure419and verbs in these clauses are affixed with -t. In the few available examples, ˀi:ma-, ˀi:miis found only in negative clauses.

Dependent clauses are formed in Yuki by attaching the dependent clause marker =namli
to the verb, by attaching the demonstrative =kiˀ or one of its derived forms, such as
kimasi directly to the verb, or by attaching to the verb one of several enclitics that are
also typically found with the switch-reference marker. The dependent clause marker
=namli displaces the mood and tense markers found in Position XI on the verb
template266. Other enclitics, such as =ka in (97) and =kiˀ in (109) are found attached to
mood and tense markers. Since these enclitics do not displace mood and tense markers,
they areplaced in Position XII of the verb template (cf. §7.2).
Relative clauses can be formed by attaching the relative clause marker =namli or one
of its derived forms to the verb. Alternatively, they can be formed by attaching =kiˀ or
one of its derived forms to the verb. Relative clauses in Yuki are either postnominal or
headless. Adverbial clauses are formed by attaching one of the adverbial forms of
=namli, one of the adverbial forms of =kiˀ, or one of several temporal coordinating
enclitics to the verb.
Serial verbs are another dependent clause construction found in Yuki. Non-final
verbs in the serial verb construction can be inflected with aspect markers, but only the
final verb in the sequence is marked with finite =mil.
15.10.1. =namli dependent clause marker
=namli is the dependent clause marker used to indicate relative and adverbial clauses.
=namli never occurs on its own on verbs. It is always further encliticized with the distal
demonstrative ki, one of its derived forms, or the temporal coordinating enclitics
=(k)on ~ =kan ‘though’ or =ka ‘when’. Therefore in addition to marking a clause as
dependent, =namli also acts as a base for attaching other morphology that specifies the
type of relative or adverbial clause. Table 36 shows all of the derived forms of =namli
observed in the texts. Examples of each of these =namli forms are provided in §15.10.2
and §15.10.3.","[440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448]"

Verbs in Huchnom and Coast Yuki are structured in the same way as in Yuki.
7.6.1. Huchnom
Huchnom is an agglutinating language, and many verb endings are recognizable and
similar to those of Yuki. (183) shows examples of corresponding affirmative and
negative clauses. The Huchnom negative -tǝl is analogous to the Yuki negatives -tan and
tal.

appear to be structured exactly as in Yuki. In Yuki imperatives can be formed by adding
an imperative morpheme -(ˀ)aˀ to the end of the verb or by glottalizing the final
consonant. (184) shows the Huchnom verb lak’- ‘come out’ with an imperative suffix -aˀ.
In (185), the final consonant of the Huchnom verb is glottalized forming the imperative
form hʌ̨wǝykil’ ‘eat!.’

7.4.3.7. -ṭan negative
Verbs are negated with the negative -ṭan. A separate negative verb ṭąl- is used to form

Schlichter (1985:254) reconstructs *tǝl (*tal?) as the negative in PNY.

A book such as this is a work of many hearts and many minds. My research and writing
is represented in the pages that follow, but this work would never have been possible
without the support of such a multitude of individuals.
First and foremost, as this grammar is based on my doctoral dissertation, I wish to
express my deepest gratitude to the members of my dissertation committee, Marianne
Mithun, Sandy Thompson, Matt Gordon, and Carmen Jany. Their work, support,
counsel, and advice were not only instrumental in writing this grammar, but also to me
personally throughout the years during my graduate studies.
Marianne Mithun introduced me to the Yuki language. We had previously already
cooperated on research on the Kato language, also spoken in Northern California in the
same region as Yuki. Shortly after that time Marianne suggested the Yuki language to
me as a possible focus for my dissertation. I’m fortunate and deeply grateful to
Marianne for suggesting this topic to me. I’m also deeply thankful for her support not
only during the research and writing of this grammar, but throughout the years of my
graduate studies and since that time. Our thought-provoking conversations on a vast
array of languages for which we both share a passion have meant a great deal to me
and have also helped shape and grow my thinking as a linguist.
Sandy Thompson is the preeminent authority on the Wappo language, which is the
only well-documented genetic relative of Yuki. During the course of my graduate
studies I had the great fortune to cooperate with Sandy on other research involving the
emergence of language structures in connected speech. When I decided to write my
dissertation on Yuki, it seemed an amazing stroke of luck that I could have Sandy as a
member of my committee and to have the benefit of her advice and knowledge on
language structure and the Yukian languages in particular. I’m grateful and deeply
thankful for this and also for the many wonderful hours I’ve gotten to spend with
Sandy over these years discussing the many linguistic topics for which we share a deep
love.
Matt Gordon and I both share an interest in the Finnic languages and also the
languages of Northern California. Early in my graduate studies Matt and I cooperated
on research on the prosody of Livonian and other less spoken Finnic languages. At that
time prosody was an entirely new field of linguistic study for me and I’m deeply
grateful to Matt for introducing me to this field and for allowing me to benefit from his
knowledge. Thanks to Matt and the research we cooperated on, I was able to write a
much more in-depth study of Yuki prosody for this grammar. I’m deeply thankful toxxiiAcknowledgementsMatt for this knowledge and his support and help over the years.
Carmen Jany is the author of Chimariko Grammar, which was based on her
dissertation – a study very much like this grammar. Her work laid the foundation for a
great deal of my own thinking of how to approach the task of writing a complete
description of a language based only on archival material and a few recordings. I was
delighted when Carmen agreed to be a member of my committee and in the ensuing
months her insight, advice, and comments proved invaluable in bringing this grammar
to its final form. I’m deeply thankful and grateful to Carmen for all she has done to help
me complete this work.
I wish to thank the speakers of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki, as well as the
researchers who worked with these speakers. All of these individuals deserve a
profound amount of gratitude and appreciation for their labor and cooperation in the
documentation of these languages. In particular I would like to express my
indebtedness for the work of Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and Alfred L. Kroeber, which
yielded the amazing wealth of Yuki language material that allowed for this description
of the Yuki language to be written. Many other researchers have written excellent
studies of aspects of Yuki grammar, but I would express my gratitude and appreciation
in particular to Alice Schlichter-Shepherd for her excellent and insightful work. Yuki
Vocabulary, which she co-authored with Jess Sawyer, her study of Yuki tone, and
reconstruction of Proto-Northern Yukian proved invaluable in the course of the writing
of this grammar.
I would like to thank Tim Powell and Charles Greifenstein of the American
Philosophical Society and Andrew Garrett, Justin Spence, and John Sylak of the Survey
of California and Other Indian Languages for their help during the course of my
research. I would like to express my gratitude to the American Philosophical Society
and the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages for providing the bulk of the
Yuki language materials I consulted in writing this grammar.
I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Carol Genetti for her
teaching and the great amount that I learned from her about language documentation
and description. I would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to Willem de
Reuse for his friendship and for teaching me so much about field linguistics.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude and indebtedness to Mary Rae Staton,
whose friendship, support, and counsel have meant so much to me during the years of
my graduate studies and since. I would also like to thank Dana Spoonerow, Karen
Barteld, Cami Helmuth, and Ra Thea for their kindness and help over the years. I would
like to thank Alex Walker for providing insight and information on the Southern PomoAcknowledgementsxxiiilanguage and also for many wonderful conversations about Northern California
languages in the time we both were students at UCSB and in the years since that time. I
would also like to thank him for his help in finding certain articles and other materials
necessary to me during the editing of this grammar prior to its publication. I would also
like to thank Andrea Berez for her friendship, support, and good sense of humor during
the course of our doctoral studies. I would like to express my appreciation to Andra
Kalnača for the thoughtful insight regarding the wording of the dedication. I would also
like to express my deepest gratitude to Ofelia Zepeda, Leslie Tolbert, and Tapani
Salminen, for their support, friendship, and inspiration from my earliest years as a
linguist.
My mother, Māra Trapāne, who shares my passion for language and knowledge, has
been a constant support and source of inspiration and encouragement throughout my
life and especially during my years of graduate school. My step-father, Andris Trapāns,
and my father, Agnis Balodis, unfortunately did not live to see the day that I completed
my doctorate, but both served as a model and inspiration to me for the joys of living a
life of the mind. I wish to express my deepest and most heartfelt love and gratitude to
my parents for all of their support and love over the course of my lifetime. I would also
like to thank them for teaching me and for raising me speaking our family’s Latvian
language. Though it is my first language, my initial interest in linguistics came through
my knowledge of Latvian and my fascination in comparing it to English and to its
relatives, Lithuanian and Old Prussian.
I would also like to express a great measure of thanks to my entire family, both those
related to me by blood and those related to me by the bonds of love and friendship. The
encouragement and love of my husband, Caleb Roehrig, has been amazing and I’m
forever grateful to him for supporting me and being there with me through these
years. I’d also like to especially thank my good friend Dirk C. van Raemdonck whose
friendship, counsel, and insight have been so valuable to me throughout these years
and especially during the writing of this grammar and its subsequent editing. My dear

Until relatively recently, Yuki and the other Northern Yukian languages, Huchnom and
Coast Yuki, were spoken in Mendocino County in Northern California. This grammar is
based primarily on spoken narratives recorded in the first decade of the twentieth
century and therefore provides a description of the Yuki language as it was spoken at
that time.
The narratives were provided by Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and recorded by Alfred
Kroeber. Supplemental examples were drawn from the large base of elicited material by
various other researchers over the course of the twentieth century. Where possible
information is also included on Huchnom and Coast Yuki, which together with Yuki
constitute the Northern Yukian languages, but which are far less extensively
documented than Yuki Proper. This was done to generate grammatical sketches of
Huchnom and Coast Yuki, and also to show how the Northern Yukian languages
compared to each other.
Each chapter of this grammar addresses a different aspect of Yuki or its speakers.
Chapter 1 describes the genetic affiliation of Yuki, the location where it was spoken,
and information on dialect differences. Historical information on the Yuki people and
the consultants is also given in this chapter, along with a grammatical sketch of Yuki
and descriptions of the data, practical Yuki orthography, and past work on the
Northern Yukian languages. Chapter 2 explains the phonetics and phonology of Yuki.
The phonetic inventory, allophonic variation, and prosodic system of Yuki are
discussed. Chapter 3 details morphophonemic alternations. Chapter 4 gives an
introduction to information on word classes described in more detail in later chapters.
Chapter 5 covers Yuki argument structure and noun morphology. Chapter 6 describes
Yuki pronouns and associated morphology. Chapter 7 details Yuki verb morphology.
Chapter 8 describes Yuki adjectives. Chapter 9 discusses the Yuki numeral system.
Chapter 10 describes Yuki quantifiers. Chapter 11 covers Yuki adverbs. Chapter 12
discusses Yuki locative terms. Chapter 13 describes Yuki connectives and also a
selection of other minor words. Chapter 14 details the Yuki system of switch-reference
marking and coordinating suffixes. Chapter 15 is a description of Yuki clause structure.
This grammar came about as a result of a dinner conversation and a great amount of
good fortune. Marianne Mithun suggested Yuki to me as a topic of study one evening at
a department dinner, while I was a graduate student at the University of California,
Santa Barbara. I went on a search motivated by my great interest in discovering all I12University of California Publications in Linguisticscould about Yuki and also by this quote found in Yuki Vocabulary authored by Jess
Sawyer and Alice Schlichter:
Unfortunately, the large collection of Yuki made by Alfred L. Kroeber is still
unavailable and unpublished. Any analysis of Yuki grammatical structure must
wait upon the availability of that material (Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:2)
From this quote I knew that somewhere the materials existed to make my work
possible. In due course I discovered the location of these materials and started on the
journey to write a grammatical description of the Yuki language. This grammar came to
completion approximately a century after the publication of Kroeber’s original 1911
sketch of Yuki in The languages of the coast of California north of San Francisco.
During the course of this work I found that as a result of a great coincidence, I wrote
large portions of this grammar only a few blocks away from the location where some of
the original narratives were recorded over a century ago. In his description of the
history of his work with Yuki, which I have included in the appendix of this grammar,
Kroeber states that he worked with Yuki speaker Ralph Moore in Covelo located in
Round Valley in Northern California, but that Moore would also come to San Francisco
to work with him. At the beginning of the Wildcat and Coyote Myth, Kroeber gives an
address in San Francisco (443 Eddy Street) as the location where these materials were
recorded. During research trips up to the University of California, Berkeley, I stayed
and wrote several chapters at a hostel in the historic Hotel Virginia near the corner of
Mason and O’Farrell in San Francisco, which happened to be located just a few blocks
away from this location given by Kroeber.","[26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

This chapter describes the morphology of Yuki verbs. The discussion begins with an
overview of the major characteristics of Yuki verb morphology and the verb template.
The discussion is further divided into sections on inflectional and derivational
morphology.
7.1. Overview
Yuki verbs are root-initial and, with the exception of the body prefixes discussed in
§2.2.1.1 and §7.3.2, all inflectional and derivational verb morphology takes the form of
suffixes or enclitics. The boundaries between morphemes in the verb are generally
fairly clear phonologically, though some assimilation and allomorphy is present157.
Verbs are suffixed with a rich collection of morphology indicating tense, aspect,
mood, transitivity, negation, questions, evidentiality, and dependent clauses. The Yuki
verb has a templatic structure: suffixes are attached to the root in a particular order
relative to each other. Yuki shows no argument marking on the verb itself158. Instead,
arguments are referenced using switch-reference markers159 and/or with actual noun
or pronoun arguments.
7.2. Verb Template
The Yuki verb template is shown in Table 17. The template shows the order that verb
morphology takes within a verb. All verb morphology, except for the body prefixes,
follows the verb root and takes the form of either suffixes or enclitics. No verbs exist
with all positions filled on the template. Most verbs have only a few slots filled on the
template. Within serial verb constructions160, verbs can occur as bare roots without any
additional verb morphology.
157See Chapter 3 for further discussion of morphophonology.
Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:12) note that in two circumstances personal pronouns act as clitics: “(1) If
a sentence consists of only a verb and a patient pronoun, the pronoun is postponed to the verb; for
example, šaˑteštekˀe ‘I’m getting cold’ < šaˑteštek + ˀiˑ. The pronoun is here intermediate between a word
and a suffix… Compare, however, čaˑna ˀi ‘Give it to me!’, where the pronoun follows the verb but remains
an independent word. (2) In the speech of Arthur Anderson, ˀąp ‘I’ sometimes becomes ˀup, its vowel
being assimilated to an u in the following verb, for example, kawaye ˀup munhek ‘I’m going to steal that
horse.’ In this case, the pronoun could be considered prefixed to the verb.”

Kroeber (1911) describes the morphology and characteristics of the Yuki verb, but does
not provide any information on the relative order of morphology attached to the verb
root.
7 .3. Verb Root and Body Prefixes
7.3.1. Verb Root
The verb root is usually monosyllabic and CVC162. Words of other word classes can
function as verb roots when suffixed with verb morphology163. Examples of this are
shown in Table 18.
N on-- VerbVerbwoknám ‘initiation’ (OG:115a)woknámespaˀ ‘(they) shall make

(CW:255)kimás ‘thus’ (CW:185)
tat ‘good, well’ (CW:255)Table 18: Verbalized words of other word classes
Verb roots can be affixed with many types of derivational morphology to derive new
meanings. For example, as shown in Table 19, the verb roots kap- ‘enter’ and nąw- ‘see’
can take on the following meanings depending on the verb morphology that has been
affixed to the root.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250]"
"1 5. CLAUSE STRUCTURE
This chapter describes the major clause types of Yuki253. These include declarative,
predicate nominal, predicate adjective, predicate oblique, question, imperative, and
negative clauses. Dependent clauses, including adverbial and relative clauses, and
complement clauses are also described.
There exist few earlier descriptions of Yuki syntax. Kroeber (1911:372) presents a
summary of his observations pertaining to syntax and word order. He also presents a
short text in Yuki with his observations of the function and meaning of individual
words, along with these other comments on Yuki syntax. The other main study
pertaining to Yuki syntax is presented by Mithun (2008), who describes Yuki argument
structure.
15.1. Constituent Order within the Clause
The most basic Yuki clause can contain just a verb. Clauses can also optionally contain
agent, patient, and dative arguments, adverbs, and obliques. This section describes
constituent order within the clause254. Yuki clauses tend to be verb-final255, but some
variation in word order does occur. (1) - (3) are examples of elicited clauses showing
verb-final word order. Verbs are given in bold in each example clause.

For constituent order within noun phrases see §5.7. Determiners are the other main type of
constituent that occur within noun phrases generally precede nouns within the noun phrase. Numerals
show more variation in position. See §9.3 for further discussion. Attributive adjectives can precede or
follow nouns, as discussed in §8.1.1.
255
The hearsay evidential ˀi is sometimes encliticized to an entire clause with the verb as the
morphological host, and therefore can be found following the verb in connected speech. Such cases are
counted as verb-final in this discussion.

A non-verb-final word order occurs when a sentence contains a complement clause.
This happens most often following quotations, as shown in (5) and (6), where quotative
inversion can be observed. The verbs in both quotes are clause-final. The verb in the
main clause in both examples is ˀímeymil ‘said’, which comes immediately after the
quote rather than at the end of the main clause. It is followed by its agent argument
hulk’oˀi ‘Coyote’. (6) also contains a patient k’óˀola ‘(to the) Wailaki’, which follows the
agent hulk’oˀi ‘Coyote’.

of verb in place of any other tense or mood marking. Kroeber (1911:363) refers to -haˀ as
the “interrogative” and Schlichter (1985:64) reconstructs *-ˀa as the interrogative mode

In the section the Yuki words šiloˀ ‘like’ and k’ol ‘other’ are described, as well as, the
Yuki words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’.
13.2.1. šiloˀ ‘like’
šiloˀ ‘like’ is a common word, which also appears as part of hilkšiloˀ ‘everything’ 242 and
halšiloˀ ‘differently’. It is unclear whether šiloˀ is an independent word, clitic, or both. On
verbs šiloˀ acts as an evidential with a meaning of ‘it seems like’ or ‘it appears like’.243
(5) - (7), are examples šiloˀ ‘like’ following nouns.

A separate chapter is devoted to the Yuki system of marking switch-reference and some
of the other morphology that is found with the switch-reference markers, because
these words and affixes form an important morphological class in Yuki. Switchreference is the use of grammatical markers to indicate whether two subsequent
clauses have the same or different topic (Jacobsen 1967, Austin 1981:309). Much like
neighboring languages, such as Eastern Pomo (McLendon 1996:539-541), Central Pomo
(Mithun 1993), and Southern Pomo (Walker 2013). The Yuki switch-reference complex,
discussed in §14.1, tracks referents between clauses and notes the temporal dimension
of these events. That means the Yuki system allows speakers to state whether events
occurred in sequence, simultaneously, or as a result of each other.
14.1 Switch-Reference Markers and Clause Connectors
In Yuki, switch-reference is indicated with a series of morphemes that nearly always
occur clause-initially. These switch-reference markers can be affixed with a connective
enclitic and are nearly always followed by the hearsay evidential ˀi, which is usually
realized phonetically as either [ey] or [iy]. Together this clause-initial reference
connective takes the form shown in Figure 9.
Switch-reference marker
Connective enclitic
or Clause Connector
Figure 9: Form of the clause-initial reference complexHearsay evidential ˀiThe clause-initial reference complex does not have to have all three slots filled. If the
reference complex is present at the start of a clause, it will always contain the switchreference marker and then optionally a connective enclitic and/or the hearsay
evidential ˀi 244. The switch-reference marker does not usually appear alone, but is
typically followed by one or both of the other elements of the reference complex.
Kroeber (1911:369-370) does not differentiate between the switch-reference markers,
clause connectors, or connective enclitics in his description of this system:244The connective enclitics are discussed in §14.2.","[389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395]"

Vi and Vu are indicating <i> or <u> following a vowel other than <i> or <u>.
38
This vowel used by Kroeber is an allophone of Yuki /o/, but its equivalent in IPA is unclear.
39
There is some uncertainty about the pronunciation of double vowels in Kroeber’s transcription. These
segments often are long vowels, but sometimes are [VʔV] sequences. Since [V:] often results from [VʔV]
in Yuki, as discussed in §2.1.1.8.8.1, it may be that for many of sequences of double vowels either
pronunciation was possible.
37Introduction371 .7. Brief Grammatical Overview
Yuki has 25 consonants and 5 vowels. Plain and glottalized variants are distinguished
for nearly all consonants, except the sibilant /š/ and of course the glottal consonants
/h/ and /ʔ/. /w’/ and /s’/ are marginal phonemes. Unlike in the neighboring Pomoan
languages aspiration and voicing are not contrastive for stops. Vowel length is either
not phonemic or only very marginally phonemic. One nasalized vowel phoneme /ą/
also exists in Yuki.
Stress in Yuki is non-contrastive and predictable. Stress occurs on the first syllable of
the stem (Mithun 1999:574). The most noticeable correlate of stress in Yuki is a very
high pitch on the syllable with primary stress and a mid to high pitch on the syllable
with secondary stress (Schlichter 1978, Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:11). Yuki phonetics,
phonology, and prosody are discussed in Chapter 2.
Yuki is primarily suffixing and is a primarily agglutinating language. Grammatical
relations in Yuki are marked on pronouns and with case-marking on some nouns.
Grammatical relations are not marked on verbs in Yuki. The grammatical relations
system of Yuki is organized according to an agent/patient pattern. Yuki argument
structure is discussed in §5.2. Yuki pronouns are discussed in Chapter 6.
Nouns functioning as grammatical patients are marked with a unique case enclitic
=ą, while grammatical agents are unmarked (Mithun 2008:302). Generally only human
nouns are marked for core cases, though non-human animates can also show this
marking from time to time. Yuki nouns can also be marked for location, and several
other categories. Number is marked only for a handful of human nouns. In addition,
unique possessive morphology is used with kinship terms. Yuki noun morphology is
discussed in Chapter 5. Kinship possessive morphology is discussed in §6.1.9.
A noteworthy characteristic of the Yuki verb system is that it contains a large
number of TAM suffixes. Kroeber (1911:370) characterizes the structure of Yuki verbs as
being root-initial, followed by one or two derivational suffixes with tense or modal
suffixes coming at the end of the verb. The derivational suffixes look for the most part
to be functioning as markers of different types of aspect, for example distinguishing
actions that are iterative, habitual, semelfactive, or moving in a particular direction
(1911:359). The tense and modal suffixes do seem to be exactly that, distinguishing
categories such as past and future time, as well as imperative and interrogative moods
of the verb (1911:362). Yuki verb morphology is discussed in Chapter 7.
Yuki is one of the few languages in California to possess an octonary numeral system
(1911:368). However, in his ethnography of the Native Californians, Kroeber (192538University of California Publications in Linguistics[1976]:176-7) notes that already at the time he was documenting the existence of this
system in Yuki, it was falling out of use among younger speakers who apparently no
longer realized that their grandparents were counting in multiples of eight rather than
multiples of ten. The Yuki numeral system is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
Another interesting characteristic of Yuki is that it utilizes a system of switchreference markers to track topic between clauses. In addition, a rich variety of other
connective enclitics is used following the switch-reference markers to indicate other
types of relationships between clauses. The Yuki switch-reference system is described
in Chapter 14.
Yuki clauses are generally verb-final, though other word orders are also observed.
Dependent clauses are formed either through the use of the dependent clause enclitic
=namli, which typically is further encliticized with demonstratives, or through the use
of serial verb constructions. Yuki clause types and strategies for forming dependent
clauses are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.","[64, 65, 66]"

7.4.4.1. ˀi ~ ˀi: ~ ˀiy ~ ˀey hearsay evidential
The most ubiquitous element in Yuki connected speech may be ˀi. Kroeber (1911) calls
the hearsay evidential ˀi the dubitative particle and gives the following descriptions of
its use:
Particle used in myths to indicate that the narrative does not rest on the
personal experience of the narrator (1911:378)…dubitative particle, here
indicating the cessation of the direct discourse in which it is not used, and
the resumption of the narrative (380).
Most of the texts collected by Kroeber were myths. Therefore all of these texts are
replete with ˀi. Other texts, such as the translated Ents and Upek story, where the
speaker, Ralph Moore, still would not have had personal knowledge or experience of271Verbsthe events in those texts, are also filled with uses of ˀi. The one text that seems to be a
telling by Moore of an event that he personally witnessed, the Feather Dance Narrative,
contains no instance where ˀi is used. This suggests that Kroeber’s original description
of ˀi, as a marker of information that the speaker has no personal experience with, is
correct.
ˀi immediately follows the switch-reference marker and coordinating suffix, if it is
present, and immediately following quoted speech. ˀi is also found following larger
constituents within the clause, such as verb arguments and following individual verbs
within serial verb constructions. (107) and (108) show ˀi immediately following the
switch-reference marker and immediately following quoted speech.

‘Thereupon he asked him, “What was that, sister’s son, that you seemed to

In Kroeber’s transcription, ˀi usually is written as a single word with the switchreference marker or switch-reference marker and coordinating suffix. In other
positions Kroeber typically writes it as a separate word, but its position suggests that it
is a clitic marking certain types of constituents as reported or uncertain knowledge.
This can be seen in the above examples where ˀi is marking the referent specified by
the switch-reference marking as reported and the quote as reported.
ˀi is also often found affixed to larger constituents within a clause. In (109), the
argument ki lalkú:tk ˀaṭat ˀóykilnamlikimáse ‘those that had crowded into Lalkúhtki’ is
separated by ˀi from the verb míṭkilmil ‘filled up’ and its argument lál ‘lake’.

=hąli is a type of inferential evidential usually translated as ‘it seems’, ‘seems to’, or
‘must be’. It is most likely derived from the verb hąl- ‘hear’. In Kroeber’s original
transcriptions of the texts, =hąli is often glossed as ‘I guess’. =hąli attaches to verbs, but
is also found following the demonstrative kiˀ that is acting as a nominal ‘that one’. =hąli
is not mentioned in earlier studies of Yuki.
(110) - (113) are examples of =hąli used in the texts. In (110) and (111), =hąli is found
in ṭ’á:tlhąli ‘seemed to touch it’ and ną́winhąle ‘going to look, it seems’, respectively. In
(110), =hąli is also found in k’oˀhąliki: ‘where it was’ or ‘where it was inside’. 195

The free translations seem to incorporate many of the nuances in meaning expressed through the
morphology of the original Yuki. However, the free translations were originally published to be read by
an English-speaking audience, therefore it may be that Kroeber avoided using “seems” twice in this
example due to the awkwardness of this use in English: ‘But now where the sun seemed to be inside, as
he seemed to touch it, it squealed.’274University of California Publications in LinguisticsIn (112) and (113), =hąli follows kiˀ ‘DST’ with the meaning ‘that must be the one’. In
(112), =hąli also follows wi:lísiwiˀ ‘went by’, but Kroeber only translates =hąli in reference
to its use with kiˀ as ‘that must be the one’. The reasons for this are unclear, but they
may be the same as those discussed for (110).

7.4.4.4. šiloˀ inferential evidential
šiloˀ can act as a hearsay evidential and may also have other uses196. As an evidential,
šiloˀ means ‘seems to’ and follows the word it is characterizing. šiloˀ can take the form of
an enclitic or can be affixed with verb morphology and function as a verb. Kroeber
(1911:358) provides this description for šiloˀ:
-cilo [-šilo] is a frequent suffix with the meaning “appearing to.” Often it can
be translated by “as it were,” or “it seems.” This suffix often has sufficient
stress-accent to furnish some justification for considering it an independent
196See §13.2.1 for a description of other uses of šiloˀ.","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"
"367368University of California Publications in LinguisticsSan [są] indicates that the subject of the sentence which it opens is the same
as the subject of the preceding sentence. Si indicates a corresponding change
of subject…-k, forming si-k, san-k [są-k], si-k-ii, san-k-ii [są-k-ii], is about
equivalent to “and,” implying that the action of the verb in the sentence
which it introduces is contemporanous with the action of the verb in the
preceding sentence. -m, forming si-m-ii, etc., may be translated “and
finally”… -kiṭ, forming si-kiṭ, san-kiṭ-ii [są-kiṭ-ii], etc., is equivalent to “and
then”… -kan [-ką], forming si-kan [si-ką], etc. can often be translated as
“thereupon”…A stem so- is also used as a base for forming several
connectives. The words derived from it seem to indicate the relation of the
ideas in two adjacent sentences, rather than the identity or difference of
their subjects as expressed by san and si. So-p is translatable as “and,” also “on
account of that.” So-n is “but.” So-m is also found. There are a number of
other connectives such as kop-han, san-kop [są-kop], si-mo-n, si-mo-p, si-k-on,
whose meaning is not yet clear.
In analyzing the switch-reference markers, clause connectors, and connective enclitics
in the texts, many of Kroeber’s descriptions proved to be accurate. In other cases
additional or different uses of these morphemes were observed in the texts. The
switch-reference markers and clause connectors as they are observed used in the texts
are summarized in Table 34245. Note that in examples in this chapter, terms in free
translations corresponding to the connectives in Tables 34 and 35 are not given in bold
as these translations do not always convey the complete meaning of these connectives
in Yuki.

current clause has the same, są-, or different, si-, topic as the previous clause. This
switch-reference marking appears not to pay any heed to agent and patient
distinctions, but instead is specifically marking the change in topic between clauses.
Clause 23, in (1), begins with si- indicating that the topic of this clause is different

the topic is hulkoˀi ‘Coyote’. Clause 24 begins with są- indicating that the topic continues
to be hulkoˀi ‘Coyote’, the same as in the previous clause.

Coyote370University of California Publications in LinguisticsThe three markers beginning with so- do not track reference, but instead link
coordinate clauses. sop has an approximate meaning of ‘but’, son clauses will often be
negative and so it has an approximate meaning of ‘however’, and som also has an
approximate meaning of ‘however’ and may be an allomorph of son246. The subsequent
clause starting with a switch-reference marker will still take the previous clause into
account, even if it begins with a so- marker that does not mark switch-reference itself.
In (2), it appears that sop- ‘but, and’ is used by the speaker to signal a connection
between two ideas. In Clause 36, the topic of the clause, ‘they’, are stopping their
travels and dancing. In the sop-marked clause, Clause 37, Coyote sings for the travelers
mentioned in Clause 36. It may be that the use of sop- in Clause 37 indicates a
relationship between the two events: they stop to dance, but then Coyote stands and
sings.
Also, note that the switch-reference marking in Clause 38 is based on the topic of
Clause 37. In Clause 36, the topic is ‘they’, in Clause 37, the topic is hulkoˀi ‘Coyote’, and
in Clause 38, the topic is once again ‘they’. Clause 38 begins with si- indicating that the
topic of that clause is different than that of the previous clause.

found on verbs in the adverbial clause enclitics =(k)op and =kon. It may be that the -op and -on components

"Introduction251 .6.2. Methods
The descriptions of phonetics and phonology in Chapter 2 are based on earlier studies
of Yuki phonetics and phonology and on analysis of an hour-long recording of Yuki
speaker Frank Logan27. This recording was also used for the study of the acoustic
correlates of Yuki stress in §2.2.1.3. Values for f0 or pitch, intensity, and duration were
measured in the phonetic analysis software Praat. Statistical analysis was performed
using the statistical analysis software SPSS 15.0.
For the remainder of this grammar, all analyses began with taking the texts of the
research corpus, described in §1.6.1, and retyping them in the Yuki practical
orthography, described in §1.6.5. Then the words in the texts were glossed and a
preliminary morphemic analysis was carried out. The glossing and division of words
into morphemes at this stage was based on Kroeber’s glosses of the texts in his original
notes and on earlier descriptions of Yuki and Yukian morphology, particularly those in
Kroeber 1911, Sawyer and Schlichter 1984, and Schlichter 1985. In his original notes
Kroeber provides word glosses for many, but not all, of the words in the texts. These
glosses were used as a starting point, but then were altered based on the sources given
here and my increasing facility with Yuki throughout the course of my work. The
morphemic analysis of all the words in the texts came as a result of my own work and
analysis of Yuki morphology.
At this point each proposed morpheme was studied by analyzing its use throughout
the texts28 and in elicited data. If the morpheme showed a consistent function, a
description was written with examples from the texts and elicitation. If the morpheme
did not show such a function, then it was determined whether the proposed morpheme
was itself composed of smaller morphemes with consistent functions. If no such
analysis was possible, then it was noted in the description that a morpheme had no
clearly determinable function29.
Free translations of examples from Origins and Coyote and the World are mostly taken
from Kroeber’s (1932:906-912,918-927) own published English-language version of these
texts. In comparing these English-language translations with the original Yuki texts, I
found that the 1932 free translations appeared to be sentence-by-sentence translations
of the original Yuki. In the rare case where I felt that the Yuki differed from Kroeber’s27This recording was made by James Crawford in 1953.
‘Texts” refers to the texts collected by Kroeber and Uldall in the research corpus.
29
For example, the function of the verb morphemes -ą and -lim, discussed in §7.5.9, could not be
determined.
2826University of California Publications in Linguisticstranslation, I give an alternate free translation of my own in a footnote. The free
translations for Feather Dance Narrative are my own. Ents and Upek and Ioi are originally
Chinook myths appearing in Franz Boas’ 1894 Chinook Texts. The English-language
version of these texts appears to have been given by Kroeber to Ralph Moore for
translation into Yuki. The free translations given with examples in this grammar are
those provided by Kroeber (1902e) with these two stories in his original notes.
For Chapter 3, examples were drawn from the corpus to identify the environment
governing particular morphophonemic alternations. For Chapter 15, examples of
particular types of clauses were drawn from the corpus and then described.
1 .6.3. Underlying forms
Sawyer and Schlichter’s Yuki Vocabulary contains modern transcriptions of a large
number of words spoken by Minnie Fulwider and Arthur Anderson during elicitation
sessions. Elicited forms are less likely to display sound changes, such as phonetic
reduction, characteristic of quick speech. For this reason elicited forms from Yuki
Vocabulary were generally used as the underlying forms for noun and verb roots as well
as other independent words for the morphemic analyses present throughout this
grammar. The term “modern transcription” refers to the orthography attributed to
Sawyer and Schlichter in Table 1 in §1.6.5, which is almost identical to the orthography
used in this grammar. Thus, for example, hąˀąye ‘now’ from Yuki Vocabulary is used as
the underlying form for hą́ye (OG:6) and hą́ˀye (OG:7).
For verb and noun roots or independent words not present in Yuki Vocabulary, the
underlying form is typically the same as the surface form or the more frequent form
when such a root or word occurs repeatedly in the texts. Underlying forms for noun
and verb morphology were generally left as they appeared in the data. Some preference
was at times given to the form some morphemes took in Yuki Vocabulary. For example,
the underlying form of the inchoative is given as -ląm, which is the form it takes in Yuki
Vocabulary, rather than -lam, which is the form it generally takes in the words recorded
by Kroeber.
In some cases suffixes may have had differing forms, but there was good reason to
pick one form over the other as the underlying form. For example, for the past tense
suffix -wi ~ -u it was clear from the description of Yuki in Kroeber (1911) as well as
analysis of the behavior of this suffix in the texts in Appendix 10 that -wi and -u were
indeed two forms of the same suffix. As -wi appeared to be a fuller form of this suffix, itIntroduction27was selected as the underlying form. Therefore, the final morpheme in nąnákwi ‘knew’
and tíweyu ‘pursued’ (both from CW:177) is given as -wi when analyzed.
When in the course of the research for this grammar a phonological process was
observed further highlighting the nature of underlying forms, this observation was
taken into account in order to refine underlying forms. For example, as discussed in
§2.1.1.8.8.1, root-final glottalization and root-final glottal stops will often spread to the
preceding vowel resulting in a VʔV sequence. This VʔV sequence is often observed in
verbs containing the root wok’- ‘sing, dance’. In Sawyer and Schlichter (1984) this root is
given without final glottalization as wok. However, given that VʔV and even root-final
glottalization is seen in verbs with this root, such as wóˀoksikiṭ ‘while dancing’ (CW:135)
and wáˀok’esmil ‘(they) danced’ (FD:21), it seemed likely that the underlying form of this
root ended in an ejective. For this reason it is given as wok’ in this grammar.
Occasionally, one encounters sporadic glottalization or glottal stops for reasons
which are not known. An aspect of this phenomenon is discussed in §2.1.1.8.2. At this
point this phenomenon does not seem to be linked to any difference in meaning and
may have been characteristic of a style of speaking in Yuki. It is encountered both in
the speech of Frank Logan, as in miṭóˀk ‘joints’, and Ralph Moore, as in hoč’k ‘is big’
(Kroeber 1901a:37), šą́:kč’am ‘sometimes’ (FD:22), and hą́lamuˀ ‘just heard’ (CW:18). These
segments are not included in the morphemic analysis line or underlying forms.
Similarly, as discussed in §3.4, the insertion of epenthetic [i] or [e] is common in
Yuki. These vowels also are not included in the morphemic analysis line or in
underlying forms.
1 .6.4. Consultants and other sources
Ralph Moore (ca. 1874/1875 - 19??) was born on the Round Valley Indian Reservation
and went on to become Alfred Kroeber’s primary Yuki language consultant for the
decades of Kroeber’s work with Yuki. Kroeber records Moore’s Yuki name as Ašíːyam
Nána’ak30. In his work with Kroeber, Moore said early on that he mainly spoke as an
Uk’omnom’, but then in later years said that he actually spoke as a Wit’ukomnom’,
adding that more specifically he spoke like the people of Olkat village, located at the
head of Eden Valley. Kroeber also records Moore as also having known Ta’nom’, due to
the fact that Moore’s mother was Ta’nom’ (Kroeber 1931-1932/1958).","[52, 53, 54, 55]"

7.4.3.2. -a(ˀ) ~ C#’ ~ Ø imperativeThe imperative mood -a(ˀ) ~ -C#’ ~ Ø 185 is used to form imperatives and prohibitives186.
No formal distinction is made between commands given to one person, versus
commands given to more than one person. Imperative verb forms are created by either
affixing -a(ˀ) to the verb or by glottalizing the final consonant of the verb. Sometimes
no overt marking may be present in imperatives (Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:111).
Kroeber (1911:363) calls -a the “usual imperative” and Schlichter (1985:65) reconstructs
*-aˀ and *-’ (glottalization of the final consonant) as the imperative forms in PNY.
Imperative -a(ˀ) takes the place of other tense or mood suffixes and occurs at the end
of the verb. ną́weta ‘look!’, in (77), tatísaˀ ‘make!’, in (78) and possibly both verbs in

"8990University of California Publications in Linguistics5 .2. Argument Structure
In this section, Yuki argument96 categories are discussed. The points below summarize
the Yuki argument categorization system.
1. The morphology distinguishes three types of Yuki verb arguments: grammatical
agents, grammatical patients, and datives97.
2. The argument of a single argument clause can be an agent, patient, or dative
argument.
3. The arguments of a two-argument clause can be an agent and a patient or a
patient and a dative argument.
4. In three-argument clauses the patient is the recipient of the action of the verb.
5. Agents and patients can be categorized at times according to their degree of
control and affectedness. Agents tend to be voluntary instigators with a high
degree of control. Patients tend to have a low degree of control and high degree
of affectedness (Mithun 2008).
6. Verbs expressing actions associated with bodily functions, mental processes, or
emotions tend to have patient arguments (Mithun 2008).
7. Typically only nouns referring to humans or to personified non-humans are
overtly marked as patients or datives (Mithun 2008).","[117, 118]"

7.4.3. MoodThe Yuki system of mood distinguishes declarative, imperative, interrogative,
necessitative, permissive, speculative, and negative moods.
7.4.3.1. =k declarative
The declarative mood =k describes a state of affairs or an action without reference to a
specific time. Kroeber (1911:362) describes declarative =k as “generally translatable by
the present tense of English. It may imply continuance. It makes verbs of adjectival
stems.” Schlichter (1985:64) reconstructs *-k or *-ki as the declarative endings for
adjectives and *-ik or *-iki as the declarative endings for verbs.
As shown in (66) and (67) in elicited examples the declarative mood often occurs in
examples that are translated as present tense in English.

However, the declarative is also found translated as other tenses. In (68) and (69),
č’a:nik is translated as past tense ‘gave’, while lu:(h)mik is translated as future or
immediate future tense ‘gonna chop (right now)’. This shows that declarative =k is not255Verbsan indicator of present tense and does not of itself make reference to a particular time.

"25Introduction23Bauer (2009:102) records an episode relayed to him concerning the use of Yuki as a
form of resistance against Euro-Americans in Round Valley. Bauer does not give the
exact date of this episode, though it likely would have occurred between around 1875
and 1935. Bauer writes:
Kinship ties only went so far in protecting Round Valley Indians from economic
exploitation, and sometimes other, subtler, forms of resistance were necessary.
Pomo Elizabeth Willits remembered that every evening during the hop-picking
season storeowner Edward Gravier drove his wagon to Round Valley’s Hop
Ranch and sold meat, vegetables, and watermelons to Indian workers when the
day’s work was concluded. On one occasion, Dixie Duncan told Gravier that in
order to boost sales he should yell out in the Yuki language, “I’m bringing good
meat. Come and get it.” However, Duncan actually taught Gravier to say, “I’m
bringing rotten meat. Come and get it.” Gravier, of course, did not understand
the Yuki language or, perhaps, the chuckles and declining sales he encountered
thereafter. For Duncan, though, this was a safe way to make Gravier look like a
heel and to resist economic domination. Duncan obviously felt comfortable
enough to use the Yuki language to poke fun at someone who could charge
usurious rates for meat and other groceries by entering the Yuki language into
what James Scott calls the “public transcript.” Duncan attempted to cause
people to not buy groceries from Gravier but did so in a way that meant
everyone - perhaps even Gravier when he discovered the ruse - could have a
good laugh, at Gravier’s expense.
1.5.3. Viability
The Yuki language is no longer spoken. No language programs exist for teaching the
language within the Yuki community at this time. The last Yuki speaker, Arthur
Anderson, died in 1983 (SSDI 2010). Even at that time Yuki had long ceased functioning
as a language of daily interaction. Yuki speaker Minnie Fulwider began her work with
linguists in the 1950s, and would later claim that she had not used Yuki since 1930.
Arthur Anderson worked with linguists Jesse Sawyer and Shirley Silver between 1972
and 1976 and at that time claimed that he had not used Yuki since 1908. Alice
Schlichter, who studied Yuki in the 1970s and 1980s writes of Fulwider and Anderson:
“Neither informant…is a fluent speaker of Yuki; probably neither ever was … The24University of California Publications in Linguisticsinformants had to remember, often with considerable and time-consuming effort,
words and phrases they had used or heard almost three quarters of a century ago.”
(Elmendorf 1981:41-2, Sawyer and Schlichter 1984:2)
1 .6. Research Corpus, Methods, and Consultants
This section contains a description of the corpus, the methods used to research and
write this grammar, and background information about the consultants. The practical
orthography is also described and compared with practical orthographies used by
previous researchers of Yuki and the other Northern Yukian languages.
1.6.1. Research Corpus
The corpus used for this grammar is drawn from the Yuki myths and other texts
collected by Alfred Kroeber from Ralph Moore between 1901 and 1903. This collection
also contains several other short stories recorded by Hans Uldall during the period
when he worked with Ralph Moore on Yuki between 1931 and 1933.
Examples in this grammar are taken primarily from Yuki texts spoken by Ralph
Moore and collected by Alfred Kroeber. These include Origins (Kroeber 1902b), Coyote
and the World (1902b, 1902d), Feather Dance Narrative (1901/1903), Thunder’s Twins
(1901/1903), and North Wind and Sun (1957-1958). These examples are referenced with
the text name and its clause number within that text26. Examples from these texts are
supplemented with elicited material from fieldwork conducted by other linguists on
Yuki, Huchnom, or Coast Yuki, when the data from the Kroeber/Uldall collection are
insufficient or when an example collected by another researcher proves effective for
illustrating a specific feature of Yuki.
Most of the Huchnom data is drawn from material elicited from Huchnom speaker
Lulu Johnson by Sidney Lamb, while most of the Coast Yuki data is drawn from material
elicited from Coast Yuki speaker Lucy Pérez by John Peabody Harrington. Some
Huchnom and Coast Yuki data presented in this grammar is drawn from material
elicited by Kroeber between 1900 and 1910.","[50, 51, 52]"
"225This alternation is also discussed in §3.5.
The root of tíˀαteˀékay ‘I have been sick’ is likely the same as dɪ́ʻday ‘I am sick in bed’ in (41). The
difference in spelling is due to differences in the transcription of the two linguists, Kroeber and
Harrington, respectively, who originally recorded these examples.

The Yuki numeral system is octonary. This means that numerals are counted in groups
of eight with a new cycle of the count beginning again at 9, 17, etc. Octonary systems
are uncommon cross-linguistically. Kroeber gives the following lengthy but interesting
account of his experience learning about and documenting the Yuki numeral system.
The Yuki system of counting - and it alone among the Yukian languages - is
not decimal or quinary, but octonary. Only the Salinan and Chumash, far to
the south, follow an analogous quaternary method. It is remarkable that the
Yuki counted on their fingers as regularly as any other people in the State.
The explanation is that they did not count the fingers but the spaces between
them, in each of which, when the manipulation was possible, two twigs were
laid. Naturally enough their “hundred” was 64.
The younger men, who have associated with the Americans, seem not to
realize that their fathers thought by eights instead of tens, and are so
confused in consequence that they give the most contradictory accounts of
even the lowest native numerals. The old generation, on the other hand, is
as innocent of our method. One of these survivors, when asked if he knew
how many fingers he had, answered without hesitation, huchamopesul, ten.
Asked how many finger and toes he had, he replied he did not know. If the
query had been how many spaces there were between his fingers and toes,
which would trip up many a civilized person required to answer without
calculation or actual count, he would no doubt have known instantly. Two
pairs of hands were then spread before him as the accepted equivalent of his
own fingers and toes, and he began a laborious count, pushing the digits
together into groups of fours. The result he announced was molmihuipoi,
nineteen. Unaccustomed to handling fingers, he had overlooked a thumb.
When the same man was allowed to place pairs of little sticks between his
own fingers, as was habitual to him, he reckoned rapidly and correctly.
The Yuki managed their count with only three real numeral words: panwi,
one; opi, two; molmi, three. Every other word denoting numbers up into the
hundreds is a description of the process of counting. Thus, a translation of
their numerals four to twenty runs as follows: two-forks, middle-in, evenchilki, even-in, one-flat, beyond-one-hang, beyond-two-body, three-body,
two-forks-body, middle-in-body, even-chilki-body, even-in-body, middle-332333Numeralsnone, one-middle-project, two-middle-project, three-middle-project, twoforks-middle-project. Sixty-four is two-fork-pile-at. There are sometimes
several ways of denoting a number. Thus eight is one-flat, or hand-two-only
(Kroeber 1925 [1976]:176-177).
Table 24 shows the cardinal numerals of the four Yukian languages2 27 . Ordinal
numerals are not recorded and not found in the texts. The data in Table 24 is given to
illustrate the numerals of the Yukian languages and to show the similarity in form of
the numerals in these four languages.

Kroeber (1911:365-6) proposes that animacy is marked for numerals pąk or pąwi ‘one’ vs.
pąwa ‘one (animate)’, ˀopi ‘two’ vs. ˀopa ‘two (animate)’, and molmi ‘three’ vs. molma
‘three (animate)’. As discussed in §8.1.2, =(ˀ)a(ˀ) ~ =(ˀ)ą(ˀ), which is the morpheme at the
end of these numerals, most likely does not mark animacy. This is due to the fact that
occasional examples are found, such as (2), showing numerals without =(ˀ)a(ˀ) occuring
with animate nouns. For this reason the precise conditions when =(ˀ)a(ˀ) is used or not
used cannot be determined.

Yuki Texts
The texts in this collection were told by Yuki speaker Ralph Moore and recorded by
Alfred Kroeber. Ralph Moore (ca. 1874/1875 - 19??) was born on the Round Valley
Indian Reservation and was Alfred Kroeber’s primary Yuki language consultant.
Moore’s Yuki name is recorded by Kroeber as Ašíːyam Nána’ak284 (Kroeber 19311932/1958).
The numeration within each text preserves the original numeration by Kroeber in
his original handwritten notes. This numeration generally corresponds to sentence
divisions. The morphological analysis of these texts is based on my analysis of Yuki
described in this grammar. The first two narratives, Origins and Coyote and the World, are
described by Kroeber as the two parts of the Yuki account of the origin of the world
(“An Indian Who Gave,” 1902:7). An excerpt from this description285 detailing how these
two texts were recorded is given below:
It was ascertained that among the Yukis only one old man knew the whole
legend of his tribe. From other Yukis part of it could be learned, but he alone
could teach it completely. But he was unable to tell it in English. At this point
Ralph Moore’ s services came into use.
Night after night the two worked at it up there at the reservation. Moore
went to the old man’s home and listened to him while he recounted the myth
slowly and laboriously. Over and over his pupil repeated it until he had it
perfect. Then he covered it with his best hat, took the Mendocino stage and
came to the university.
Down here he devoted the most of his two weeks’ time to relating and
explaining this myth to the anthropologists. Much of the Yuki language was
recorded in this way.
It was first written in the Yuki language as told by the old man. Then it was
translated word for word into English. Obscure passages were gone over and
explained. Songs occurred in this course of the story and these were recorded
284An English translation for Moore’s Yuki name is not recorded by Kroeber.
This description appeared as part of an article (“An Indian Who Gave Our College Professors Pointers”)
in the Sunday Call Magazine of San Francisco, California on March 16, 1902. It describes Kroeber’s work
with Ralph Moore and the recording of the Yuki creation story and several types of Yuki songs.","[492, 493]"

‘Sometimes we dance 2 nights, sometimes 3 nights, sometimes one week.’
Kroeber describes =(ˀ)a(ˀ) as an animacy marker in his sketch of Yuki (1911:368). It is
true that =(ˀ)a(ˀ) does occur most often with animate nouns, but a further examination
of the pattern of use of =(ˀ)a(ˀ) shows that the occurrence with animate nouns is more a
symptom of its use rather than an explanation for its use.
First, it must be noted that for Yuki nouns in general the distinction between
animate and inanimate referents is not one of primary importance. Instead the
distinction that matters most in Yuki is that between human and non-human referents.
Core case-marking, for example, occurs for human, personified non-human, and also
occasionally for highly affected non-human referents; however, in general, non-human
animate referents are not marked for core case. Thus, it would be strange that in word
classes such as adjectives and numerals that often occur with nouns or, in the case of
numerals, can even function as nouns themselves, there would exist a significant
grouping (animate vs. inanimate) different from that seen for Yuki nouns in general
(human vs. non-human).
Second, it is true that =(ˀ)a(ˀ) does occur almost always on adjectives and numerals
referring to human nouns, even in elicitation, and also commonly those adjectives
referring to animate non-human nouns or even inanimates, as shown in the examples
in §8.1.2. One can also observe inconsistent use of =(ˀ)a(ˀ) with the same noun-adjective
pairs, suggesting that the function of =(ˀ)a(ˀ) is not to mark animacy itself, but some
other yet to be determined feature such as focus and contrast discussed below in §8.3.
Compare (18) and (19). In the two examples the same noun ˀat’wąšit ‘dog’ occurs with318University of California Publications in Linguisticsthe same adjective č’al ‘white’, yet in (18) the noun phrase ˀat’wąšit č’al ‘white dog’ is not
marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ), while in (19) the same noun phrase is marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ).

receive core case marking in Yuki, including patient case. By contrast, the degree to
which a referent is affected by the actions of a verb is not connected with =(ˀ)a(ˀ)
marking on adjectives. Thus, although =(ˀ)a(ˀ) and the patient case enclitic =ą ~ =a look
similar, =(ˀ)a(ˀ) functions differently from patient case marking in this regard as well.
The examples below show that affectedness does not influence the use of =(ˀ)a(ˀ). In
elicitation, where a referent is not affected at all, one finds the example shown in (20)
where the noun phrase mi:li ho:ṭ ‘big deer’ is marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ), while in (21) and (22)
where the noun phrases mil ˀunšil ‘small deer’ and ˀiyi opi ‘two (of the enemies)’ are
highly affected by the verb liˀ- ‘kill’, no =(ˀ)a(ˀ) marking is found on these noun phrases.
This is especially noteworthy in (22), as the affected referent is human.

8.2. Predicate AdjectivesPredicate adjectives can be suffixed with verb morphology and function as verbs.
Human arguments of predicate adjectives are grammatical patients. This can be seen in
Kroeber’s elicited material, as shown in (23).

These examples show some of the range of the predicate adjective in Yuki. The
meaning of hąčámmil ‘was solid’ and hač’ámt’mil ‘was firm’ is much as expected from a
predicate adjective: X is <adjective>. In (26), the meaning of hąčámečyakmil ‘made strong
(fast)’ seems to extend beyond the area typically seen for predicate adjectives221.

"10University of California Publications in Linguisticsalso contains some information about the Yuki and Huchnom languages, though not
much data in either language.
Sydney Lamb worked with Yuki speakers Minnie Fulwider, Arthur Anderson, and
Frank Logan during the 1950s. James Crawford also worked with Frank Logan during
this period. In the 1960s, Roy Siniard also worked with Minnie Fulwider. Jesse Sawyer
and Shirley Silver worked with Yuki speaker Arthur Anderson in the 1970s. Later these
data were analyzed by Alice Schlichter14 for her MA thesis, which was published as Yuki
Vocabulary in 1984 credited to her and Jesse Sawyer (Elmendorf 1981:40-1, Sawyer and
Schlichter 1984:2).
William Elmendorf also worked with Yuki speakers. Field notes collected by
Elmendorf, Lamb, and Kroeber are housed at the Survey of California and Other Indian
Languages (SCOIL) in the Linguistics Department of the University of California,
Berkeley. Curtin’s (1889) BAE survey vocabulary is also available on microfilm at SCOIL.
All of the Yuki materials from Kroeber’s work with Moore in the early twentieth
century are housed at the American Philosophical Society (APS).
The three seminal works on the Yuki language are Kroeber’s 1911 original
grammatical sketch of Yuki published as a chapter of The Languages of the Coast of
California North of San Francisco, Sawyer and Schlichter’s 1984 Yuki Vocabulary, and
Schlichter’s 1985 unpublished Ph.D. dissertation The Yukian Languages. Kroeber’s 1911
description contains the only published description of Yuki grammar and the only
published text in Yuki. Sawyer and Schlichter’s 1984 dictionary is a comprehensive
index of Yuki vocabulary containing data from previous researchers, as well as from
Jesse Sawyer and Shirley Silver’s previous work with Yuki speakers Minnie Fulwider
and Arthur Anderson. Yuki Vocabulary also contains a sketch of Yuki phonology, which
lists Yuki phonemes and gives a brief description of vowel allophony in stressed and
unstressed syllables. Schlichter’s 1985 Ph.D. dissertation contains her reconstruction of
Proto-Yukian, as well as valuable information about the grammar and phonology of the
three contemporary Northern Yukian languages, Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki.
Beyond this there are a number of articles and other unpublished studies available
on various aspects of Yuki. Mithun (2008) contains a discussion of the Yuki agentpatient grammatical relations system. Mithun (2012) discusses morphological
borrowing in Yuki. As noted above, in an extensive but unpublished study, Uldall (1932)
claims that Yuki is a tone language, which is rebutted by Schlichter (1978). Elmendorf
(1981) discusses language change in languages near extinction using Yuki and Wappo as
case studies for his article. Early descriptions of Yuki and the Yuki people are found in
14In more recent publications, Schlichter published as Alice Shepherd.","[37, 38]"
"Phonetics and Phonology71Other examples support this analysis. For example, šuˀ- ‘sit, stay’ (AA, MF) shows the
VʔV sequence characteristic of the spreading of root final glottalization in the
accompanying form šuˀuhek ‘sitting’81 (MF). Similarly, while only t’u:- ‘rain’ (AA, MF) and
not t’uˀ- is given in Sawyer and Schlichter (1984), the accompanying sentence t’uˀuwičk
‘it rained’ (MF) shows the same VʔV sequence suggesting the presence of a final glottal
stop in the root of ‘rain’ as well.
Therefore, it is possible that there truly are no CV verb roots at all, as, at least in
existing data these seem to invariably end in a phonetic long vowel and therefore are
possibly concealing an underlying final glottal consonant. However, there is a
complicating factor to this conclusion. This is that word stress correlates strongly with
vowel duration. Thus, in some of these cases it may be that vowel length in a CV verb
root is just a result of stress rather than an assimilated glottal stop.
CV noun roots pose a similar problem. Some CV noun roots ending in a phonetic
long vowel are also documented as having a form ending in /h/. Thus, for example,
‘hole’ is documented as nih (AA, MF) but appears as ni: in this example where it is
followed by inessive –k’e, ni:k’e kaptek ‘he put it into the hole’ (AA); t’u: ‘heart’ (AA) also
appears as ṭ’u(h) (MF). CVʔ noun roots often occur also as CVʔV, for example siˀ ‘clover’
(MF) and siˀi (MF)82. No CV noun roots have been found so far where CVʔ yields an
alternate CV: form. However, since the VʔV ~ V: alternation is common, it is certainly
possible that such forms may have existed.
Thus, it is currently not possible to conclude with absolute certainty that there are
truly no CV noun or verb roots. The first person plural inclusive agent pronoun mi
which often appears as mi: and the second person singular agent pronoun miˀ which
often appears as miˀi show that there is at least a single word in Yuki, the first person
plural inclusive agent pronoun mi, which is CV83. Therefore, it can be said that at least
CV words are possible in Yuki and so there is always a chance that there also may have
been as yet undiscovered or unknown true CV noun and verb roots. However, at this
time it seems that in Yuki and all vowel-final noun and verb roots actually end in a
glottal consonant or alternatively that there are true CV verb roots alongside those
that are CVʔ or CVh.
There are CVCV verb roots attested with the most common being the verb ˀimi- ‘say’.
However, most other CVCV verb roots are likely CVC or CVCVC roots for different81The full example is: ka ˀąp ˀonk’e ša:tk’e šuˀhek ‘I’m sitting here on the cold ground.’
This example is taken from Siniard 1967b:1, where it originally appeared with tone marks as part of the
phrase sīˀī sī:k ‘Clover is green’.
83
No other alternate form for mi other than mi: is ever observed.
8272University of California Publications in Linguisticsreasons. For example, the CVCV verb root la:le- ‘crawl’ (MF) is likely actually lal-84. It is
not uncommon to find /e/~/i/ following verb roots as this is the epenthetic vowel85
common in Yuki for dividing consonant clusters. An example of this in use would be /i/
following the root wąk- ‘pay, lend’ in wąkiwič ‘lent’ (FL).
With regard to CVCV noun roots, once again it seems that the clearest case for such
roots comes from borrowings which were presumably quite recent at the time of
documentation. These include words such as the Spanish borrowing mu:la ‘mule’ (MF).
There are some rare non-borrowed CVCV noun roots such as mąwe ‘marked bone used
in handgame’ (AA).
Some CVCV verb roots from earlier documentation and analysis such as hana‘know’86 are later recorded by other linguists as having a final consonant; in this case
this is hanak- (AA). In these cases it seems likely that the final consonant in the verb
root was not heard or not recorded as part of the root by the linguist documenting the
original form.
Examples of noun roots are shown in (40a) and examples of verb roots are shown in
(40b). Syllable boundaries are marked within disyllabic roots.

hana- ‘know’ is taken from Sawyer & Schlichter 1984:120. As it is a form recorded by Kroeber, there is a
high degree of likelihood that it was recorded from Ralph Moore, Kroeber’s primary Yuki consultant.
85Phonetics and Phonology732 .5. Phonetics and Phonology of Huchnom and Coast Yuki
The consonant inventories of Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki are the same (Schlichter
1985:22a). The vowel inventories are slightly different for the three Northern Yukian
Languages, as shown in Figure 8. In her reconstruction of Proto-Northern Yukian,
Schlichter (1985:30) notes that Coast Yuki /e/ and Huchnom /ʌ/ correspond to Yuki
/ą/. She also notes (1985:39) that “e and a seem to have been tending toward a merger
in Coast Yuki, both often being realized as [æ].” Insufficient data are available to
describe the stress system of Huchnom or Coast Yuki.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"
"5.2.1. Agents, Patients, and Datives
In terms of argument structure, Yuki is an agent/patient language98. While the case of
arguments is for the most part a lexicalized feature of verbs, Yuki argument categories
do exhibit some unifying characteristics. Semantic role and degree of affectedness are
the most salient factors in characterizing agents, patients, and datives in Yuki.
Morphologically, these three types of arguments are distinguished by unique agent,
patient, and dative pronouns for pronominal arguments. For noun arguments, agents
are unmarked, while patients, when marked, are marked with the enclitic =ą, and
datives, when marked, are marked with the enclitic =ąt.
96Payne (1997:170) states that “a syntactic argument of a verb is a nominal element (including possibly
zero, if this is a referential device in the language) that bears grammatical relation to the verb.”
97
Henceforth grammatical agents and grammatical patients are referred to as agents and patients,
respectively.
98
See §5.3.2 for a more detailed description of the morphology of the agent, patient, and dative cases
along with examples of different clause types containing such arguments.",[118]

‘… said Coyote speaking W ailaki.’
In (114) and (115) the noun is followed by -ą or -a. The analysis of this possible
morpheme is uncertain. It could just be an echo vowel resulting from the glottal stop. It
could also be that in certain situations nouns affixed with instrumental -ok are also
affixed with patient case marking when these nouns are considered to be highly
affected by the action of the verb in that clause. There are too few examples to really
know for certain, but there is some qualitative difference between the level of
affectedness of yímok ‘by the fire’, in (113), where fire is not affected, but is instead
scorching others, and lílaˀok ‘with his stone’, in (114), where the stone, though being
hurled, is still being affected by the action. Perhaps the same is true for (115), but
without more examples of k’oˀol k’ani ‘Wailaki language’ in this kind of a use, it is not
possible to say for certain why patient case marking may occur in this example.
5.4.14. Stacking Noun Cases
Oblique noun cases can be “stacked” or added onto nouns already marked with an
oblique noun case. In (116), allative =wit and lative =op are attached to ˀon ‘earth’.

Nomlaki; Stonyford, Salt Pomo; Wintun of Stony Creek.’138University of California Publications in Linguistics(117) Coyote and the World: 165 (excerpt), RM

5.5. Derivational Morphology and Other Enclitics
In Yuki there are several examples of derivational morphemes. -ič can be a diminutive
marker though its meaning is often unclear and the infix -ˀV-, -hV- can also function as
a diminutive marker. There is also an enclitic =kič ‘only’, which may not be derivational,
but does not neatly fit into other categories of noun morphology.
5.5.1. -ič diminutive, etc.
Kroeber (1911:354) describes -ič as “apparently primarily a diminutive … also a
collective, a distributive, and, through idiom, the plural of one noun denoting persons.”
Kroeber’s described meanings for -ič can be seen in the examples he provides,
reproduced in (118). The one exception is a distributive meaning for -ič, which is not
apparent from his examples. The relationship, if one exists, between diminutive -ič and
juxtapositive =iṭ or between diminutive -ič and =kič ‘only’ is unclear. Kroeber provides a
list of examples of -ič in use, shown in (118).","[164, 165, 166]"

This section describes questions in Huchnom and Coast Yuki.
15.8.3.1. Huchnom
Lamb (1955:31) records several Huchnom content questions and their responses. The
questions begin with a question word, as in Yuki. The verbs in these questions appear
to be affixed with -ˀą, which may possibly be cognate with the Yuki interrogative -ha.
Compare the question in (54a) with its answer in (54b). Note the presence of -ˀą at
the end of the verb hayima:ˀą ‘doing’ in the question in (54a), and its absence on the
same verb in (54b).

"Introduction7differences, as they were remembered by his consultants during his fieldwork at Round
Valley in 1937:
Dialectic differences among Yuki subgroups included speed in speaking,
different words for the same thing or act, and slightly divergent accents. The
Ukomno’m and Witukomno’m were regarded as fast talkers, while the Ta’no’m
and Huititno’m spoke more slowly. An example of phonetic difference follows:
small, ónsil (Titomno’m), únsil (Ukomno’m). An example of word difference is:
hot, pukhólt (Witukomno’m), šúmlil (Huititno’m and Ukomno’m). An example of
different expressions is: to quiet a child, úlai (Witukomno’m), čiči (Ukomno’m),
k’íha (Huititno’m), k’oš (Ta’no’m; Wailaki word). In calling a child there are the
following: my child (either sex), ik’ili (Huititno’m); my son (lit., “my child my
father”), ik’il-eŋk’un, and my daughter (lit., “my child my mother”), il’il-eŋk’an
(Ukomno’m and Ta’no’m); my son (lit., “my child father”), ik’il-k’un, and my
daughter (lit., “my child mother”), ik’il-k’un (Witukomno’m).
Foster (1944:161) also gives this description of how strange or unfamiliar Yuki
dialects were perceived by speakers of other Yuki dialects:
The word hálsi (to put more with) was used with reference to the language
of subgroups other than that of the speaker. Strange dialects sounded
complicated, and their speakers were thought to make them so simply for the
sake of effect. Tillotson8 thought the Huititno’m were especially guilty of this;
conversely, they considered their dialect to be the most pure of all Yuki speech.
1 .1.5. Contact Languages
Language contact is a phenomenon that must be considered when describing the
languages of Northern California. This region is home to over 20 language families,
most situated in close proximity to each other and composed of small languages, which
have never been spoken by more than a relatively small group of speakers. The result
of this proximity is a long history of contact9, intermarriage, and multilingualism
among members of these communities (Haas 1976, Mithun 1999, Conathan 2004).
8Tillotson was one of Foster’s Yuki consultants. (Foster 1944:156)
For an updated and in depth examination of the processes that shaped the linguistic diversity of
California based on not just historical but also quantitative analysis, see Haynie 2012.","[34, 35]"
"Figure 1: The Yukian Language Family
Beyond its relationship to Wappo, more distant genetic relationships for Yuki have
also been posited (Mithun 1999:310, 574). Sapir (1929) incorporated Yuki and Wappo as
a separate branch into Hokan-Siouan, Elmendorf (1963, 1964) felt that Yuki and Wappo
displayed similarities to Siouan and Yuchi, and the possibility of a relationship betweenIntroduction5Yuki, Wappo, and Yuchi has also been discussed from time to time by other linguists
(Munro 1994, Golla 1996a).
1 .1.2. Location
The Northern Yukian languages were spoken in three ecologically distinct regions
located within present-day Mendocino County in Northern California. Yuki was spoken
in the inland Round Valley area, which is located in the Coast Range mountains and
bounded on three sides by tributaries of the Eel River (Miller 1979:9). Huchnom was
spoken to the southwest of the Yuki speech area. The Huchnom lived along the
drainage of the South Eel River within a heavily forested and mountainous area
(Kroeber 1925 [1976]:202). Coast Yuki was spoken to the west of both of these areas on
the Pacific coast. Most Coast Yuki settlements were on or near the coast itself beginning
a short distance north of Fort Bragg and extending up along the sea to an area a few
miles north of Rockport (Miller 1978:249)3.
1.1.3. Identity
Prior to contact with Euro-Americans, the Yuki divided themselves into villages, also
called rancherias, which were led by a local chief. Groups of villages formed a tribelet
that was centered on a single large village, called a no’hot ‘to live big,’ containing a
dance house and the residence of the chief of the tribelet4 (Miller 1978:250, Foster
1944:157).
Speakers of Yuki identified themselves with respect to one of several tribal
subdivisions. Foster (1944:157) states that in pre-contact times, the Yuki recognized six
major subdivisions, which were characterized by minor linguistic differences. These six
tribal subdivisions were: Ta’nom’, Ukomnom’, Huitítnom’, Witukomnom’,
Onkolukomnom,’ and Sukšaltatamnom’5. Two further minor subdivisions are also
recorded immediately to the south of the Ukomnom’. These were the Laikutnom’ and
Ontitnom’6 (Miller 1978:249). Huchnom tribal subdivisions are not known, though the

relative to natural and manmade landmarks.

See Appendix 2 for a map of villages within the Northern Yukian speech area.
5
Yuki nom’ ‘people’ was also used in Yuki names for neighboring non-Yuki-speaking peoples. It was also
commonly affixed to placenames “to indicate affiliation with a place or group (Foster 1944:157).
6
Foster (1944:157) gives this description of the tribal subdivisions: “The grouping is not to be thought of
as we think of city, county, and state; these concepts are far too precise. Rather, it is in the sense that we6University of California Publications in Linguisticsdistribution of Coast Yuki tribelets is recorded by Barrett (1908:262-3) and Gifford7
(1965:5-13).
Since a unified Yuki tribal identity did not exist in pre-contact times, there also did
not exist a name for the Yuki people as a whole in the Northern Yukian languages.
Indeed, Kroeber (1925 [1976]:166) notes that the use of “Yuki” as the ethnonym for the
group of people we today refer to as the Yuki is a Euro-American innovation rather
than a practice that existed beforehand. The term “Yuki” originates in Wintu, where
the word yuˑki refers to strangers or enemies.
1.1.4. Dialects
A limited amount is known about dialect divisions within Yuki. Nothing is known about
the dialects of Coast Yuki or Huchnom. Within Yuki there existed dialect differences
among some tribal subdivisions. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:166) writes:
There are dialectic divergences within the area of the Yuki proper. The speech
of the Ta’no’m, Ukomno’m and Witukomno’m differs. The Utitno’m dialect
classed with the Witukomno’m, the Lilshikno’m probably with the Ta’no’m, the
group including the Suk’ano’m may have leaned either to Ukomno’m or
Witukomno’m, while the affiliations of the three eastern divisions of
mountaineers are not known. All the dialects were mutually intelligible, but
apparently different enough for any Yuki to recognize the approximate
provenience of another.
By the beginning of the twentieth century, when Kroeber began his work on Yuki, it
seems that dialect differences had largely been lost among Yuki speakers. He observes
that as a result of English-language schooling, Native American children from Round
Valley would often lose their parents’ language or if they continued to speak it,
differences between dialects were probably getting “blurred out” (Kroeber 19311932/1958). Foster (1944:161) gives this account of the nature of Yuki dialectsay ‘I am a Middle Westerner,’ ‘I am a Southerner,’ or ‘I am a New Englander,’ and differences in speech
were probably about as marked. But instead of a national governmental organization for the whole area,
the Yuki had only consciousness of kind to bind them together.”

A phonemic glottalized form /y’/ exists for the other Yuki glide /y/, thus the
existence of phonemic /w’/ in Yuki would not be unexpected. In addition, /w’/ also
exists in Wappo (Thompson et al. 2006:3), therefore there is a precedent for this
phoneme in Yukian. Phonemic /s’/ on the other hand is extremely rare typologically
and occurs only phonetically or allophonically in the non-Northern Yukian languages
spoken in the region surrounding Yuki.

Nasals occur in two places of articulation: bilabial and dental. The lateral approximant
is dental, the central approximants are bilabial and palatal. Plain and glottalized
variants are distinguished for all nasals and approximants. Glottalized nasals and
glottalized approximants are pre-glottalized.
2.1.1.6. Gemination
There are no phonemic geminate consonants in Yuki. However, sequences of two
identical consonants can result in phonetic geminates. These are found from time to
time at morpheme boundaries, as a result of the coda consonant of one morpheme
being the same as the onset of the subsequent morpheme49. Only one instance of this
type of phonetic geminate is found in the Logan recording. As shown in (2), a phonetic
geminate /m/ occurs in kómmuṭ ‘came’ when -mą, a verbal suffix indicating movement,
is suffixed onto the verb root kom- ‘come.’

"Introduction31 .1. The Yuki Language
This section contains a description of the genetic affiliation of Yuki, the location of the
historical Yuki speech community, Yuki identity, dialect divisions, and contact
languages.
1.1.1. Background and Genetic Affiliation
The Yuki language is a member of the Yukian language family and has only a single
possible generally agreed upon relative, the Wappo language (Mithun 1999:574). Wappo
was spoken to the southeast of the Yuki-speaking region, in the Russian River Valley,
north of San Francisco, California (Thompson et al 2006:xi). A genetic relationship
between Yuki and Wappo is at present more accepted than not, though some have
argued that similarities between Yuki and Wappo are ultimately due to language
contact rather than a shared origin (Sawyer 1980).
Yuki itself is divided into three varieties1: Yuki (Proper), Huchnom2, and Coast Yuki,
which are collectively referred to as the Northern Yukian languages (Golla 2011:188).
Elmendorf (1968) describes Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki as “language-like
dialects” that formed a chain from east to west. The three varieties of Yuki have nearly
identical grammar and differ mainly in terms of their phonology and lexicon (Golla
2011:189).
1Arguments can be made for calling Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki dialects of a single
language or separate, but closely related languages. On one hand, they are grammatically very similar
and are thought to have been mutually intelligible (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:211, Golla 2011:188-189). On the
other hand, speakers of Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki inhabited ecologically distinctterritories and differed in terms of their significant ceremonies and myths (see §1.4). It is possible that
the relationships among the Northern Yukian languages were not unlike those among the Scandinavian
languages or Spanish and Portuguese; a group of distinct ethnicities speaking languages of a high degree
of mutual intelligibility. However, this may also be a question that could remain unanswerable due to the
lack of speakers of any of these languages or extant Coast Yuki and Huchnom communities.
2
The Huchnom have also been referred to as the “Redwoods,” or by their Pomo appellation Tatu, while
the term Huchnom means “mountain people” (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:202). Sawyer and Schlichter (1984:155)
give a different translation for Huchnom. They connect it with Yuki huč ‘outside’, so that hučnom’ would
mean ‘outside people’. In Lamb’s (1955:27) notes, the pronunciation of “Huchnom” as spoken by his
consultant Lulu Johnson is given as hú̩čnó̩ˀom̥ in Lamb’s orthography or approximately [hutʃnoʔom̥] in
IPA. The [oʔo] segment is a result of the spreading of glottalization of the word-final glottalized sonorant
to the preceding vowel. This is a common process also in Yuki (see Chapter 2), therefore most likely
Huchnom was also pronounced as [hutʃnoʔm] in a form without this spreading. The Coast Yuki referred
to themselves as Ukoht-ontilka ‘ocean people’. (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:212)4University of California Publications in LinguisticsThe term “Yuki” has been used to refer to the Northern Yukian languages in general,
but also to the Yuki (Proper) language in particular. In order to avoid confusion, in this
grammar the term “Yuki” is used to refer only to the Yuki (Proper) language, while
Yuki (Proper), Huchnom, and Coast Yuki are collectively always referred to as
“Northern Yukian.”
While Wappo is more different from all of the Northern Yukian languages than any
of these languages are from each other, the exact relationship among the three
varieties of Northern Yukian is unclear. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:211) writes that the Coast
Yuki considered their speech to be more similar to that of the Huchnom than that of
the Yuki. This would make a certain amount of sense as the Coast Yuki were
geographically closer to and likely in more frequent contact with the Huchnom than to
the Yuki. However, Kroeber notes that the lexicon of Coast Yuki seems to be about
equally similar to that of Huchnom and Yuki, but that a thorough analysis of the three
Northern Yukian varieties will be necessary before a final determination of internal
relationships can be made. In terms of intelligibility, Kroeber speculates that all three
languages must have been mutually intelligible to some extent, but that a Coast Yuki
unacquainted with either Huchnom or Yuki would not have been able to follow a
conversation fully in either of these languages.","[30, 31, 32]"
"468University of California Publications in Linguistics1 . ORIGINS
Recorded in 1902, Alfred Kroeber (1902b) writes that this myth was told to him by
Ralph Moore, but that Moore had been taught the myth by a Yuki speaker named
Diddle, who was “recognized as the old man who best knew it [this myth].” In these
notes, Kroeber calls this the Taikomol myth, but later calls it Origins in his (1932)
published English translations of the myths that were told to him by Ralph Moore. The
English free translations of this myth are taken from one of these translations (Kroeber
1932:906-912).
In comparing the original Yuki recorded in Kroeber’s notes with the translations, it
quickly became apparent that the 1932 free translations of Origins and Coyote and the
World were sentence-by-sentence translations of the original Yuki. The free
translations are largely unaltered from Kroeber’s original. In rare cases alterations
were made when a translation for a particular sentence did not seem to match the
original Yuki as well as it could have. Material present in the English translation, but
not in the original Yuki, either because of missing pages or other unknown reasons, is
given in square brackets. Origins is recorded in Notebook 29 (Kroeber 1902b). In some
cases Kroeber notes alternate forms. These are given as footnotes in this version.
Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of these alternate forms are taken from the
glosses provided by Kroeber in his original notes.","[495, 496]"

"68University of California Publications in LinguisticsStating that as Uldall’s falling and dropping tones both descend in pitch, they should be
considered a single falling tone. Elmendorf (1968:22) describes Huchnom and Yuki as
having pitch accent with three pitches: high, low, and falling.
Schlichter (1978:6) notes that Uldall never claims that Yuki tones are contrastive and
in fact never provides a single tonal minimal pair. Schlichter reexamines Uldall’s claims
and argues that instead of being evidence for a system of phonemic tone or pitch
accent, the “tones” observed by Uldall are actually a consequence of several different
phenomena. She argues that Yuki is a stress-accent language with high and mid level
pitch acting as perceptual cues for primary and secondary stress, respectively (1978:245). She also observes that unaccented suffixes show mid, low, or falling pitch as a result
of sentence-level prosody (1978:20).
In one area, Schlichter (1978:23-4) finds evidence for the possible emergence of a
tonal or pitch contrast in Yuki. This is a result of the intervocalic weakening and
deletion of [ʔ] and [h] in VʔV and VhV sequences75, resulting in phonetic long vowels
with a falling pitch. The result is a series of possible minimal pairs shown in Table 7.
The deletion of these intervocalic segments is a result of fast speech (1978:23), but the
extent to which the falling pitch had truly phonemicized is not known.

Schlichter uses an acute accent ( ́) to mark high-level tone and a circumflex ( ̂) to mark high-falling
tone. High-level tone here is a result of primary stress, as primary stressed syllables have the highest
pitch in a word.
76Phonetics and Phonology692 .2.3. Intonation
The Logan recording does not contain any connected speech, and at this time no
recordings of Yuki connected speech are known to exist. The elicited words and
phrases do show certain prosodic features. Logan repeats each word or phrase twice.
The second repetition will sometimes show decreased f0 and intensity compared to the
first repetition. The final syllable of the second repetition will sometimes show
lengthening.
2.3. Syllable structure
Non-final syllables take the form CV(C). Final syllables can end in a cluster of two nonidentical consonants, CV(Cα)(Cβ). Words composed of a single CV syllable are quite rare.
All consonants except for glottalized sonorants and /s’/ can be syllable onsets: m, n, p,
p’, t̯, t’, ṭ, ṭ’, k, k’, ʔ, č, č’, s, š, h, w, y, l. All consonants except for glottalized stops and
affricates can be coda consonants: m, m’, n, n’, p, t̯, ṭ, k, ʔ, č, s, (s’), w, (w’), y, y’, l, l’. As
discussed below, there does not seem to be an absolute prohibition on glottalized stops
in coda position. Instead such consonants seem to be disfavored as codas. Consonant
clusters can occur in coda position, but only word-finaly. The shape of Yuki consonant
clusters is discussed in §2.1.1.7. Only vowels are permitted to be syllabic nuclei. All
vowels can occur in this position within the syllable: a, ą, i ~ e, o, u.
As discussed in §2.1.1.4.4, it is uncertain whether /s’/ and /w’/ ever occurred in
surface forms or only underlyingly; however, the position where these consonants
occur underlyingly is word-final and therefore syllable-final.
Glottalization in ejective stops and affricates occurring underlyingly in root-final
position typically spreads to the preceding vowel where it can be assimilated as a long
vowel or then further reduced to a short vowel. For example, ˀuk’ ‘water’ is realized as
ˀuˀuk ~ ˀu:k ~ ˀuk. Occasionally, one finds forms such as ˀu:t’ ‘weasel’ (Kroeber 1901a:4,
RM) and pá:t’.wá ‘flat’ (OG:76b), which may indicate that there is not an absolute
prohibition on syllable-final glottalized stops. However, such forms are the exception
rather than the rule and the far more likely surface form for such syllables will be one
where the syllable-final glottalization spreads to the preceding vowel as described
above for ˀuk’ ‘water’. Examples of Yuki words divided into syllables are shown in (39).","[95, 96, 97]"

"Adjectives3218 .3. Comparatives and Superlatives
Yuki does not have a construction for forming comparatives or superlatives. Instead
various methods are used to express comparative or superlative meaning.
One method for forming comparatives is to place two adjectives in apposition. In
(29), ‘I am bigger than you’ is expressed by saying ‘I am big, you [are] small’. In this type
of construction, one adjective is marked with =(ˀ)a(ˀ). This use suggests that =(ˀ)a(ˀ) may
function as a marker of focus and contrast in Yuki, as here a contrast appears to be
drawn between two statements referring to two different referents.

‘I’m a younger woman than s/he is.’In other instances particular words are used to highlight the superlative nature of
the adjective. In (31), leˀ ‘little’ is combined with ˀunšil ‘small’ to emphasize the small

“she lives in a little, little house” or “he has a big, big appetite.”

Other constructions are occasionally found, but it is unclear the extent to which
these can be generalized for forming comparatives or superlatives in Yuki. In (34), -ˀet
‘be like’ is used to emphasize the easiness of the work, thereby creating a kind of
comparative or superlative.

"98University of California Publications in LinguisticsThe genetic relationships among many of the languages of this part of the world are
either non-existent or so ancient as to be unknowable to contemporary scholars using
any widely accepted method of historical reconstruction. The result of this is that
Northern California is a region that historically has been characterized by a great deal
of language contact involving unrelated languages.
Yuki is located between three unrelated language families: Athabaskan to the north,
Wintun to the east, and Pomoan to the south. Evidence for contact between the Yuki
and their neighbors can be found in descriptions of Yuki culture. For example, contact
between the Ta’nom’ Yuki, in the northern part of the Yuki speech region, and the
Athabaskan Wailaki was significant enough that southern Yuki would refer to the
Ta’nom’ as k’o’il, which is the generic Yuki term for Athabaskan speakers. The Ta’nom’
and Wailaki frequently intermarried and the Ta’nom’ are said to have been wellacquainted with the Wailaki language (Foster 1944:159). Kroeber (1925 [1976]:182-4)
describes the similarities between Yuki religion and that of the Pomo, Wintu, Maidu,
and more peripherally also the Achumawi. During the nineteenth century following the
establishment of the Round Valley Indian Reservation, the Yuki also came into close
and regular contact with speakers of Konkow Maidu, Nisenan Maidu, Achumawi10,
Atsugewi11, Modoc, and Yana who had been removed from their home territories to
Round Valley by the United States government (Bauer 2009:18, Miller 1978:249).
The Modoc and Yana did not form separate communities on the Round Valley Indian
Reservation following their removal to Round Valley (Bauer 2009:108). This suggests
that few Modoc and Yana speakers came to Round Valley and presumably few
individuals speaking these languages were in contact with Yuki speakers.
Not all of the languages bordering Yuki are equally well-documented. For example,
of its northern Athabaskan neighbors, Lassik, Sinkyone, Kato, and Wailaki, complete
descriptions of Lassik, Sinkyone, or Wailaki do not exist. Kato was documented by Pliny
Earle Goddard in the early twentieth century, but Goddard’s published description
(1912) does not reflect the insights into Athabaskan phonology and morphology that
have been discovered during the course of the twentieth century. Due in part to the
incomplete documentation of some of these languages, it can be difficult to determine
the extent to which they might have influenced or been influenced by Yuki in precontact times or more recently.","[35, 36]"

mik’al ‘around’ may be an independent word or an enclitic. Kroeber (1911:356) lists
mik’al in the inventory of noun case suffixes and describes it as, “-mik’al, around. Is used

-ok is used as an instrumental case expressing the meaning ‘with’ or ‘by’, as in lašok
‘with an ax’ (Kroeber 1911:355) or yimok ‘by fire’. Kroeber (1911:355) simply describes
this case as “instrumental.” Instrumental -ok is found only with inanimate nouns.

12.2. Other Locative Terms
Table 29 shows other Yuki locative terms. Utilizing the same methods used to form
additional locative terms from the demonstratives, other locative terms can likewise be
formed from many of the words shown in Table 29. mik’al ‘around’ and ˀič ‘near’ are
included in the list, but straddle the boundary between case ending and independent
word. mik’al is described in more detail in §5.4.12 and ˀič is described in more detail in
§5.4.11 as the juxtapositive case.

Riverine deictic systems, used for telling direction according to the flow of water in a
river or rivers, are common among California indigenous languages (Kroeber 1925
[1976]:15-16). Specifically riverine terms are not found in the texts, though Sawyer and
Schlichter (1984:226) do record at least one riverine deictic mulk’il ‘upstream’. However,
at least two montane deictics, which are deictics oriented according to mountains, are
also recorded ˀumey ‘uphill’ (CW:42) and ku:twit ‘downhill’ (MF) (Sawyer and Schlichter
1984:69). It may be that in the valley environment inhabited by the Yuki, mountains
and general locative terms, such as kaṭa ‘here’ and kiṭa ‘there’ were more important in
terms of directions than referring to rivers. It also may be that some terms, which
originally had riverine meanings, changed over time. Huchnom has riverine deictics.
One of these deictics kuhtɪˀ ‘downstream’ is similar to Yuki kuhtki ~ kutki ‘north’.
12.4. Locative Terms in Huchnom and Coast Yuki
12.4.1. Huchnom
Huchnom has some of the same locative terms found in Yuki, such as kaṭaˀ ‘here (right
here)’, which is nearly identical to Yuki kaṭa ‘here’, and other terms, such as ˀumɪt̯ ‘over
there’, which appear cognate to less commonly seen forms, such as Yuki ˀumey ‘uphill’.
A selection of Huchnom locative terms is given in (13) and (14).

ˀumit kΩˀoyʌ: ‘he went o ver there’One of the most interesting aspects of the Huchnom system of locative terms is the
existence of riverine deictics. Riverine deictic systems orient directions according to
position relative to the flow of water in a river or system of rivers. It is also358University of California Publications in Linguisticscharacteristic of other languages of the area in which Yuki, Huchnom, and Coast Yuki
were spoken (Kroeber 1925 [1976]:15-16).

‘upstream’Kroeber notes that Maidu terms referring to cardinal directions may have originally
been riverine, but under the influence of the Kuksu cult been transformed to a
directional system relative to the sun. Kroeber (1925 [1976]:16) writes:
The cognate Maidu words [names for directions] are said to have the same
meaning as our own. But it is possible that the Maidu have given a sundetermined meaning to original drainage terms under the ritualizing
influence of the Kuksu cult. This may also be what happened among
southern Wintun, Pomo, and Yuki, who constantly use words like “north,”
while the central Wintun think in terms of waterflow. It has been customary
among inquirers to assume that Pomo yo means “south” because a group
consistently uses it for that direction; which, of course, is no proof. In any
event, it is likely that exact south, when they knew a south, was determined
for most California tribes by the prevailing direction of their streams as
much as by the meridian of the sun.
Therefore it is possible that the Huchnom riverine meaning for kuhtɪˀ ‘downstream’
shows the original meaning of Yuki kuhtki ‘north’, as well.
12.4.2. Coast Yuki
The same proximal/distal distinction seen in the Yuki and Huchnom third person
pronouns and demonstratives is also seen in Coast Yuki, as shown in (16).

transcription.

hʊ́yk’æ ‘in the middle’Further information on the Coast Yuki system of locative terms is not available.
Therefore it is not known whether the Coast Yukis used any type of unique reference
system, such as the riverine and montane deictics seen in Huchnom and Yuki.","[380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387]"

7.3.2. Body Prefixes
The ‘body prefixes’ are found in verbs and nouns. The meaning of these words relates
to the part of the body described by the prefix. Thus ną- ‘belonging to the head or
mouth’ occurs in nąnákuč ‘remembered’ and ham- ‘(perhaps) to do with the senses’
occurs in hamlótu ‘was hungry’. It is unknown whether the body prefixes were already
fully incorporated into the verb root during the period in which Yuki was documented
or whether these prefixes acted in any way as an independent component of the verb
root, perhaps as a kind of classifier164.
7.4. Inflectional Morphology
Yuki verb roots are suffixed with inflectional morphemes indicating tense, aspect, and
mood.
7.4.1. Tense
Yuki verbs are marked minimally for tense. Two types of past tense are distinguished,
-wi ‘past’ and -wiṭ(k) ‘completed past’, and also a future tense -paˀ. In the texts, the finite
verb enclitic =mil is very common.
7.4.1.1. =mil finite
The function of =mil is described by Kroeber (1911:371) as: “The suffix -mil … replaces
the finite tense endings but is itself indefinite as to time, indicating merely that the
verb to which it is added is the principal or finite verb of the sentence.”
=mil is ubiquitous in the many Yuki legends and myths recorded by Kroeber. =mil is
also found throughout the Feather Dance Narrative, which appears to be a description
164See §2.2.1.1 for further discussion and other examples of the body prefixes.","[250, 251]"
"Introduction11Powers (1877), Powell (1891), Kroeber (1906, 1911, 1925 [1976]). The relationship of Yuki
to Wappo is discussed in these works as well. Other more recent discussion in support
of this relationship is found in Elmendorf (1968, 1981, 1997) with Sawyer (1980)
providing the dissenting opinion claiming that similarities between Yuki and Wappo
are due to contact rather than shared origin. Possible effects of contact between Yuki
and the Athabaskan languages are discussed in Kroeber (1959). More distant proposed
genetic relationships are discussed in Sapir (1929), Elmendorf (1963, 1964), Swadesh
(1954), Shipley (1957), Greenberg (1987, 1996), Golla (1996a), Munro (1994), Kimball
(1992, 1997), Elmendorf and Shepherd (1999).
1.2.2. Previous Work on Huchnom and Coast Yuki
None of the Northern Yukian languages were thriving at the beginning of the twentieth
century; however, Yuki was still in a much better position in terms of speakers and
active language use than Huchnom or Coast Yuki at that time. For this reason Huchnom
and Coast Yuki have been less well documented than Yuki, and texts were never
collected in Huchnom or Coast Yuki. Golla (2011) describes the history of work on
Huchnom and Coast Yuki. Powers (1877) collected a Huchnom vocabulary, and Barrett
(1908) collected a survey vocabulary of Huchnom. Kroeber also collected data on
Huchnom consisting of vocabulary and short elicited phrases. Lamb (1955) collected
material from the last speaker of Huchnom, Lulu Johnson. Schlichter (1985:13)
describes this material as “the largest and most reliable body of data” on Huchnom. The
Kroeber Huchnom materials are housed at the APS, while the Lamb Huchnom materials
are housed at the SCOIL.
Coast Yuki is not well documented. Kroeber elicited vocabulary and some short
phrases in Coast Yuki from two different speakers, Tim Bell and Sam Slick (Kroeber
1902c:60, 90). These materials are contained in the collection of Kroeber’s Yuki
materials at the APS. Harrington collected lists of Coast Yuki vocabulary and
placenames, which are part of the collection of his papers available on microfilm from
the Smithsonian Institution. In addition, Golla (2011) mentions a Coast Yuki survey
vocabulary collected by Barrett (1908), general and natural history wordlists collected
by Merriam, a short word list collected by Driver (1935), and a cultural vocabulary
contained in Gifford (1939). Gifford (1939) was republished in 1965 and has great value
beyond its linguistic content. Gifford’s study is a detailed ethnography of the Coast
Yuki. It should be noted that Schlichter (1985:13) considers Gifford’s transcriptions of
Coast Yuki unreliable.","[38, 39]"
"16University of California Publications in Linguistics1 .3.4. Peace, Religion, and Allotment
Hostilities in Round Valley ended around 1865, and it was at this time that Indian
Agents began to turn their attention to acculturation of the Yuki and the other Native
peoples living in Round Valley, by teaching them how to live as Euro-Americans. The
government plans appeared to amount to taking the Yuki and other Native inhabitants
of Round Valley and turning them into farmers (Miller 1974:163-172). However, to do
this successfully, Native people would need to have their own land to farm, which was
an elusive goal throughout the decades following the mid-1860s. Eventually, plots of
land were allotted to a portion of the Native inhabitants of Round Valley after the
passage of the Dawes Severality Act in 1887 (Miller 1978:249).
The relationship between the settlers and Native inhabitants of Round Valley
remained tense during this time. The settlers were not interested in sharing their land
claims and continued to ignore the boundaries of the Round Valley Indian Reservation.
Settlers would allow their animals to graze on reservation land or even stake claim to
it. The settlers also successfully undermined attempts by Round Valley Indian
Reservation authorities from stopping these actions (Miller 1974:260-4). Only in 1892
was a final agreement reached between the United States government and settlers. The
settlers were compensated for property that was within the boundaries of the
reservation, as they had been defined in 1890, and they agreed to move off these lands
(Miller 1974:315-16).
The religious life of the Native community of Round Valley also underwent change.
During the years following the establishment of Round Valley Indian Reservation, those
living on the reservation were discouraged from practicing their ceremonies and other
religious observances. The Yuki who lived and worked on ranches located off the
reservation continued to practice their ceremonies, which served as a means for
maintaining these Yuki traditions. The Yuki living on the reservation would not
practice these ceremonies there, but would leave the reservation to participate in these
same ceremonies with other Yuki at sites off the reservation (1974:217).
Major attempts to convert the Yuki to Christianity did not occur immediately
following contact with Euro-Americans. Instead it seemed the settlers were more
interested in claiming land in Round Valley than in changing the religion of its original
inhabitants. This approach began to shift in 1869 following the enactment of President
Ulysses Grant’s “Peace Policy,” which modified the way in which Indian Agents were
selected. Instead of these positions being political appointments, during the years this
policy was in effect the agents were either army officers or individuals nominated byIntroduction17religious organizations (1974:176-7). In 1871 the Methodist Episcopal Church of
California won its bid to appoint individuals of its choosing as the Indian Agents of
Round Valley Indian Reservation (1974:186-7). This change in leadership approximately
coincided with the period during which the Ghost Dance movement reached Round
Valley indirectly resulting in an interesting episode of mass conversion to Methodism
by the Yuki and other Native peoples of Round Valley.
The Ghost Dance of 187020 emerged in the late 1860s in Nevada as a new religious
movement among Native Americans. It reached Round Valley as two different
subsequent religious movements, the Earth Lodge Religion and the Bole-Maru Religion.
The Earth Lodge Religion foretold the end of the world in 1872, but then quickly
decreased in followers after the predicted apocalypse did not occur. The Bole-Maru
Religion came to Round Valley following the decline of the Earth Lodge Religion. It
espoused a positive vision of the afterlife and a belief in the sacredness of the teachings
of individuals, which were believed to have been inspired by an anthropomorphic
Supreme Being (Miller 1974:218).
The Bole-Maru Religion spread quickly among the Native inhabitants of Round
Valley. Its popularity at this time may have had the curious effect of motivating mass
conversion to Methodism among the Yuki and other Native peoples of Round Valley in
1874, due to the similarity of the tenets of the two religions. Within a few months over
nine hundred members of the Native American community of Round Valley had
converted to Methodism (1974:218-20). The reservation officials at the time were
astonished, and as they were Methodists themselves, they considered this mass
conversion nothing short of a miracle.
The revival was short-lived; however, as corruption among reservation officials and
broken promises concerning the allotment of farmland to members of the Native
community Round Valley ultimately led to disenchantment and disillusionment with
Christianity. By 1876 attendance at Methodist church services had dropped
considerably (1974:226-7). In the following years Protestant missionaries were on the
reservation from time to time, and the Native community of Round Valley remained
nominally Protestant, but they did not actively practice their adopted religion. Among
the Yuki there was a return to practicing traditional social dances and other dances
that had been “dreamed” by practitioners of the Bole-Maru Religion (1974:324).","[43, 44, 45]"

brother to stand at the (north) end of the world in summer, his sister in

In 1902, Coyote and the World was told by Ralph Moore and recorded by Alfred Kroeber
(1902b, 1902d). Kroeber calls this text the Coyote myth in his original notes, but later
calls it Coyote and the World in his (1932) published English translations of the myths that
were told to him by Ralph Moore. The English free translations of this myth are taken
from one of these translations (Kroeber 1932:918-927). In comparing the original Yuki
recorded in Kroeber’s notes with the translations, it quickly became apparent that the
1932 free translations of Origins and Coyote and the World were sentence-by-sentence
translations of the original Yuki. The free translations are largely unaltered from
Kroeber’s original. In rare cases small alterations were made when a translation for a
particular sentence did not match the original Yuki as well as it could have. Material
which was present in the English translation, but not in the original Yuki, either
because of missing pages or other unknown reasons, is given in square brackets. The
numbering of the clauses is kept consistent with Kroeber’s own numbering in his
original notes. Therefore, this text begins with clause (6). (6) - (91) are recorded in
Notebook 29 (Kroeber 1902b). (92) - (423) are recorded in Notebook 31 (Kroeber 1902d).
In some cases Kroeber notes alternate forms. These are given as footnotes in this
version. Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of these alternate forms are taken
from the glosses provided by Kroeber in his original notes.","[547, 548, 549]"
"456Appendix 5: Kroeber’s “History of the Recording of Yuki”457I slipped, or had slipped for me, the data on the Yuki language in the following years,
and worked on it as I could, but there were many languages and cultures needing
attention in California.
In 1910 I visited Round Valley for the U.S. Census and spent two days in the
Superintendent’s office with Ralph Moore, which showed chiefly that many of the
tribal attributions entered in the Government books in the 1860’s were quite random,
but that they had been passed on to children and grandchildren.
In 1911 I published a section on Yuki (pp. 345-383) in The Languages of the Coast of
California North of San Francisco, as no. 3 of volume 9 of the American Archaeology
and Ethnology series of University publications. For a preliminary report, the
morphology is not bad, but the phonological underpinning is weak.
I had also arranged with Boas for a contribution to the Handbook of American Indian
Languages, of which the first volume also appeared in 1911; but I had asked to be
released. The Handbook consisted of studies some of which were final and all of which
had had far more time expended on them than I had been able to give Yuki. My account
of it as published in Berkeley was one of a group of preliminary reports - some of them
quite brief sketches; it would have been out of setting in the context of matured
grammars by Goddard, Swanton, Boas, Dixon, Jones, and Thalbitzer.
There is one statement on page 370 of the 1911 exposition which it seems pertinent
to withdraw and deny explicitly. It is to the effect that the study of Yuki offers less than
expectable difficulty “on account of the scarcity of phonetic changes in derivation and
suffixation.” This was said before morphophonemics had been discovered; but the
highly complex and subtle morphophonemic interactions of Yuki might have been
recognized then, under another designation, if I had been better able to hear the tones
and glottalizations of the language.
About this period, I learned from Goddard of the kymograph tracings devised by
Rousselot, one of whose brass machines Goddard had persuaded President Wheeler to
acquire for the University. Between 1911 and 1914 I published on Mohave, Diegueño,
and Marshall Micronesian phonetics and mode tracings of Papago and other languages.
Later I realized that these visible renderings of speech could not replace properly
trained hearing as a foundation, and that Sapir was right in his view that they might
serve, like a crutch, in an emergency, but not as a basic method of development of
understanding. I think now - after some recent preoccupation with Goddard’s
Athabascan materials - that Goddard’s hearing was fairly sensitive, but remained
unsure; and I know that I was unsure, and not only about Yuki. At any rate, in 1912, I
had Ralph Moore down to the University again, and recorded some 50 sheets of tracings458University of California Publications in Linguisticsof Yuki, each bearing perhaps 25 to 50 word tracings. I also had a dentist’s palate made
to fit Ralph’s mouth and used it by dusting with powdered soapstone.
In 1923 I had Ralph at the University once more and this time went over my whole
slip catalog of the morphemes of the language, writing on the slips in new green ink
what I then heard. This rendering was maturer than before: I recognized durations an
breaths pretty satisfactorily, glottal stops and effects better than previously, and might
have worked out a rather adequate proto-phonemic system had I not remained deaf to
the tones.
It may have been at this time that Lowie dropped in where I was working with Ralph,
listened a while, heard tones, and convinced me.
At any rate, in May 1927, I was back at the kymograph with Ralph running it this
time at high speed to stretch out the voice vibrations so that the number of them = per
inch or centimeter might be counted and the pitch of vowel be ascertained objectively.
Again, a case of unsureness, not trusting myself to learn to recognize such tones as
there might be - after which the measured counts might have had confirmatory value I again leaned on the machine to make decisions for me. Quite properly for my pains, I
did a lot of counting and measuring with mainly inconclusive results. The most distinct
pitch profile that emerged from the counts was a rising one! And its few occurrences do
not coincide in their distribution with any take of Uldallian stem tone.
During the same summer of 1927, Fang-Kuei Li, thru a student of Sapir’s at Chicago
was studying Athabascan Mattole in the county adjoining that in which Round Valley
Reservation and Covelo are situated. His publication Mattole, an Athabascan Language
appeared in 1930. He had, in the same summer of 1927, some briefer experiences with
two other Athabascan languages: Hupa, which Sapir was then studying at Hoopa, and
Wailaki, on Round Valley Reservation. At Sapir’s request, he undertook to see if any
Yuki were available, and to report on the tones. Ralph Moore seems to have been away,
and Li did not connect with Eben Tillotson whom George Foster worked with on culture
a few years later, and whom I saw at Hull’s Valley on a brief visit made with Frank
Essene in the summer of 1938. Li did secure material from two informants, [blank]

The next effort was through Hans Uldall, the Danish linguist trained by Jones the
British phoneticist. He was in the country on a fellowship from the Committee on
[blank] , of which Boas was chairman for [blank] The fellowship was for about two
years, during which time Uldall lived in Berkeley, except when off in the back country
with Indian informants. He worked on Maidu, supplementing Dixon’s study; also on
Achomawi and perhaps other California languages, in collaboration with Jaime deAppendix 5: Kroeber’s “History of the Recording of Yuki”459Angelo and L.S. Freeland. He agreed, with Boas’ consent, to detach himself temporarily
from these commitments and do what he could to put the Yuki house of tones in order.
Ralph Moore again came down to the University, and the three of us began work in
1931. But Ralph had a cough and felt unwell; we had him examined; the report was
tuberculosis and diabetes. We persuaded him to enter a Sanitarium which the Bureau of
Indian Affairs maintained in the Sierra Nevada. So the quest was checked once more.
Ralph’s health definitely improved, and in 1932 he returned for a renewed stay at
Berkeley, which lasted [blank]A ppendix 6
