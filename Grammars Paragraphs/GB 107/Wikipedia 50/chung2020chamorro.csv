"17.1OverviewNegative sentences differ from affirmative (nonnegative) sentences in form
and meaning. A negative sentence is false when the corresponding affirmative sentence is true, and vice versa. In addition, a negative sentence contains
an element which is not in the corresponding affirmative sentence and which
expresses the (meaning of) negation. Chamorro has three ways of expressing
sentence negation: with the sentential negative ti, with a negative verb, or
with a negative indefinite that is syntactically focused. Negative sentences
formed with these elements have a distinctive syntax: they allow negative
concord and occur in the negative ‘even’ construction.
This chapter begins by discussing how negative sentences are formed. It
then describes negative concord, negation and scope, the negative ‘even’
construction, and negation in clauses truncated by ellipsis.",[396]

‘(There were) three children (who) didn’t come to the party.’This statement glosses over various details, including the following: (i)
Many speakers will realize the internal argument of a transitive verb as the
direct object when it has wide scope with respect to negation, but as an
antipassive oblique when it has narrow scope (Chung 1998: 387-388). (ii)
Pivots of the negative existential verb tåya’ ‘not exist’ must have narrow
scope with respect to negation (Chung and Ladusaw 2004: 100-103).

The fact that the subject of a negative sentence in Chamorro always has
wide scope with respect to negation can be shown in another way. In
Chamorro, a nonspecific noun phrase cannot be the subject of a negative
sentence. This is because such a noun phrase would have to satisfy contradictory requirements: nonspecific noun phrases must have narrow scope
with respect to negation, but the subject of a negative sentence must have
wide scope with respect to negation. Consider, for instance, nonspecific
noun phrases formed with the null indefinite article. These noun phrases can
be the subjects of affirmative clauses as long as the specificity restriction is
observed (see 16.4), but they cannot be the subjects of negative sentences
(though see 6.2.1.2.2.2 for an exception). Compare the affirmative sentences
in (21) with their negative counterparts in (22).

"15.4InterjectionsInterjections are word-sized or phrase-sized expressions used on their own to
make conversational moves. Like other languages, Chamorro has a large
number of interjections. This section surveys some of the most common
interjections used to affirm, deny, greet, bid farewell to, thank, and hesitate.
The affirmative interjections include the polite hunggan ‘yes’ and the
more informal affirmatives (h)å’a, (h)u’u, and u nai, all of which mean ‘yes,
yeah’.
There is one negative interjection, åhi’ ‘no’. Doubt, uncertainty, or indecision can be expressed with hekkua’ ‘I don’t know, dunno’. Hekkua’ can be
followed by an embedded question, as in (25).

EMPSecond, a negative concord item cannot serve as the subject of a negative
sentence (see 17.3).
A negative sentence can contain general indefinites that have not combined with the word-level negative ni. General indefinites in this use are
called negative polarity items. They have meanings and distributions that are
similar to negative concord items, although their form is different, as can be
seen from (14).

often. More typically, a general indefinite combines with ni to produce a
negative indefinite that can serve as a negative concord item.
9.2.2.3
In conditionals and comparatives
General indefinites can serve as nonspecific indefinites in the antecedent
clause of a conditional sentence or the standard of a comparative sentence.
In these constructions, they can be translated into English as follows: håyi
‘any(one)’, håfa ‘any(thing)’, månu ‘any(where)’, ngai’an ‘anytime’, kuåntu
‘in any quantity’, and taimanu ‘in any way, to any degree’.
In Chamorro, the antecedent clause of a conditional sentence is usually
introduced by one of the subordinating conjunctions yanggin, anggin, an, or
kumu, all of which mean ‘if’ (see 20.2.2). Like other adverbial clauses, the
antecedent clause can precede or follow the clause in which it is embedded.
The antecedent clause can contain a general indefinite. In the antecedent
clauses of the conditional sentences below, the general indefinite serves as
part of the predicate in (15a) and as the subject in (15b-c).

that expresses sentence negation. In such cases, two expressions of negation
will cancel each other out, producing the same meaning as an affirmative
sentence. The simple sentences in (7) contain two expressions of sentence
negation: the focused negative indefinite ni un tåotåo ‘no person’ plus a
second expression, which is the negative ti in (7a) and a negative verb in
(7b). Because two expressions of negation cancel each other out, (7a) has the
same meaning as ‘Everyone cried’; (7b) has the same meaning as ‘Everyone
has hardship in their lives.’

Two other aspects of the negative ‘even’ construction are more challenging. First, it is not clear what grammatical relations an ‘even’ phrase can
be associated with. ‘Even’ phrases are generally associated with the subject
of the negative sentence. They can also be associated with the direct object.
But speakers react more variably when ‘even’ phrases are associated with
other grammatical relations, such as possessor of the pivot of an existential
verb (see 14.2.2). Compare (26a) with (29).

This is an area where further investigation is needed.
Second, it is unclear what the word-level negative ni contributes to the
meaning of this construction. It was pointed out earlier that the ‘even’ phrase
does not express sentence negation. Nonetheless, there are indications that
the ni in the ‘even’ phrase might negate the noun phrase or adverbial clause
it combines with. Ni can combine with constituents that must be licensed by
negation of some sort, such as the negative polarity items un grånu (in ni un
grånu ‘not a bit’) or put diós (in ni put diós ‘not at all’).6

—The negative verb taigui ‘not be (at a location)’ and its affirmative counterpart gaigi ‘be (at a location)’ are ordinary intransitive verbs. The other verbs
in (3) have special properties. The verbs tåya’ ‘not exist’ and guaha ‘exist’
are impersonal verbs of existence (see 14.2.2). The verbs tai ‘not have’ and
gai ‘have’ are verbs of possession that incorporate the noun that names what
is possessed (see 14.3). Finally, the negative verbs cha’- ‘better not, don’t’
and mungnga ‘don’t’ are used in constructions that function as negative
imperatives (see 15.2.2). Some examples of sentences formed from negative
verbs appear below.
(4) a.",[397]
"17.3Negative concordA negative sentence can contain one or more negative indefinites following
the predicate, in the normal locations of arguments or adjuncts. These negative indefinites do not express sentence negation. Instead, they are negative
concord items: they agree in form with the element that expresses sentence
negation, but have the meaning of nonspecific noun phrases.
To illustrate: The negative sentences below have just one element that
expresses sentence negation: the negative ti in (8a) and (8c), and the negative verb tåya’ ‘not exist’ in (8b). These sentences also contain a negative
indefinite that follows the verb and serves as a negative concord item;
namely, ni håyiyi ha’ ‘anyone’ in (8a), ni unu ‘anyone’ in (8b), and ni un
grånu na guihan ‘any bit of fish’ in (8c).
(8) a.",[400]
"38317.5Negative ‘even’Chamorro has several words that are sometimes translated as ‘even’. One
such word is the adverb or preposition kuntodu ‘including, also, too’, which
combines with a noun phrase in the unmarked case. Kontodu occurs almost
exclusively in affirmative sentences, such as (23).

‘All of the salt water eels look similar (lit. are the sort of creatures

negative ‘even’ construction.
In the negative ‘even’ construction, a constituent consisting of ni plus a
noun phrase in the unmarked case occurs at the left edge of a negative
sentence. This constituent (called the ‘even’ phrase below) is understood to
be the subject of the negative sentence. The construction as a whole conveys
that there are others besides the referent of the subject for which the negative
sentence is true. For instance, the ‘even’ phrase in (24) is formed from the
noun phrase i katu ‘the cat’. Sentence (24) means ‘Even the cat doesn’t want
the dog’s leftovers’—or, equivalently, ‘Not even the cat wants the dog’s
leftovers’ (see Horn 1969). Implicit in the meaning is the idea that there are
others besides the cat that do not want the dog’s leftovers.

"15.2ImperativesImperatives are forms of verbs or adjectives that direct the addressee(s) to do
something. Their subject is always missing and understood to refer to the
addressee(s). Affirmative imperatives are described in 15.2.1. Negative imperatives, which present some complications, are discussed in 15.2.2.
15.2.1 Affirmative imperatives
Affirmative imperatives are formed from verbs or adjectives in the irrealis
mood by omitting the person-and-number forms of agreement (see 2.2.2.3).
For practical purposes, this means that the imperative of a transitive verb
shows no agreement at all.
(1)a.",[364]
"4Chamorro has other words or morphemes that a negative concord item can
agree with. These include the verb adahi ‘be careful (lest)’ and comparatives
formed with the comparative suffix -ña (see 25.3.1).
380Negation17.4Negation and scopeThe distribution of negative concord items reflects a more general fact about
the Chamorro language: the subject of a negative sentence must have wide
scope with respect to negation.
A noun phrase in a negative sentence has narrow scope with respect to
negation if the negation affects what it refers to. Consider the noun phrases
in boldface in (18). Sentence negation affects the reference of these noun
phrases, as becomes clear when their meaning is compared with the meaning
of the sentence as a whole. Thus, miyon na tåotåo means ‘a million people’,
but the meaning of the sentence in (18a) is that there are fewer than a million
people in the CNMI. Todu kalulut-ñiha means ‘all their fingers’, but the
meaning of the sentence in (18b) is that some of their fingers were not
touched by the speaker. Bulan buelu means ‘many ruffles’, but the meaning
of the sentence in (18c) is that the speaker likes there to be few ruffles on her
dress. These noun phrases have narrow scope with respect to negation.

Negative indefinites that are not syntactically focused serve as negative
concord items—nonspecific indefinites that agree in form with the element
that expresses sentence negation (see 17.3).1 In Chamorro, sentence negation
can be expressed by the sentential negative ti ‘not’, a syntactically focused
negative indefinite, or a negative verb (e.g. tåya’ ‘not exist’; see 17.2).
Negative concord items agree in form with one of these elements; they do
not have negative meaning, but instead have the meaning of nonspecific
indefinites. Compare the form of the negative concord items in (12) with the
English translations of the sentences in which they occur.

DoloresWhat prevents a negative concord item from serving as the subject of a
negative sentence? Recall that the subject is the most prominent constituent
of the clause (see 3.2.1). Further, nothing prevents a negative concord item
from serving as the subject of an embedded clause when sentence negation
is expressed in a higher clause (see (14d) and (14e)). These observations
suggest that in order for a negative concord item to agree with sentence negation, it must be syntactically less prominent than the negation. Suppose
that sentence negation occupies a prominent position in the clause—more
prominent than any of the predicate’s arguments or adjuncts, except the
subject. Then negative concord items that are direct objects, obliques, and so
on will be able to agree with the negation, because they will be syntactically
less prominent than it. Negative concord items in an embedded clause will
likewise be able to agree with the negation in a higher clause. But a negative
concord item that is the subject of the clause containing the negation will be
unable to satisfy this condition, because the subject—as the most prominent
constituent of the clause—will be more prominent than the negation it is
supposed to agree with.4
In generative syntax, prominence is defined in terms of relative height in
constituent structure (c-command). One way of accounting for the distribution of negative concord items in Chamorro is to say that a negative concord
item must agree with a sentence negation that c-commands it. Notice that it
would not work to try to state the condition in terms of word order. This is
because sentence negation is realized to the left of subjects and nonsubjects
alike, and the word order of the subject with respect to other arguments and
adjuncts is flexible (see 3.4 and 4.1).",[405]
"15.1OverviewChamorro has separate forms for affirmative and negative imperatives, as
well as an exclamative construction and a familiar range of interjections. All
these constructions are discussed in this chapter.",[364]

the result is ungrammatical. This ungrammaticality differentiates negative
concord items from nonspecific noun phrases introduced by the null indefinite article, which can serve as subjects of negative sentences under some
circumstances (see 6.2.1.2.2.2).
Ungrammatical negative sentences like (15) and (16) can be repaired in
various ways. The most straightforward repair is to remove the sentential
negative ti and syntactically focus the negative indefinite so that it becomes

Some aspects of the negative ‘even’ construction are relatively straightforward. Specifically:
(i) Sentence negation in the ‘even’ construction is expressed in the
usual way, with the negative ti (as in the examples above), a negative verb

they occur in a clause embedded within the clause in which sentence negation is expressed. The complex sentences in (14) consist of a main clause in
which the negation is expressed, plus an embedded clause—finite or
infinitival—that contains a negative concord item. The negative concord
item serves as the direct object of an infinitive in (14a), an embedded
passive agent in (14b), an embedded antipassive oblique in (14c), and an
embedded subject in (14d) and (14e).22When a negative concord item is the subject of an embedded clause, it
must be syntactically focused—displaced to the left edge of the embedded
clause by wh-movement. Such negative concord items provide the only
exception to the generalization that a focused negative indefinite expresses
sentence negation.

6The verb in (30a) can be analyzed in several ways. If it is a passive (‘Not
even a bit was given to him’), then the ‘even’ phrase is associated with the
subject; if it is an ordinary transitive verb (‘Not even a bit they gave to
him’), or the transitive or passive form of a concealed applicative (‘Not even
a bit they gave him’, ‘Not even a bit he was given’), then the ‘even’ phrase
is associated with a direct object or oblique. There are two ‘even’ phrases in
(30b), a fact that suggests that these phrases can be iterated. It is not clear
how to translate ni put dios in this example.

387Laws, one of which states that the negation of a disjunction is equivalent to
the conjunction of two negations. If ni were to negate the disjunction si
nanå-mu pat tatå-mu ‘your mother or your father’, the result—’not [your
mother or your father]’—would be equivalent to ‘[not your mother] and [not
your father]’, which would supply the ‘and’ that forms part of the sentence’s
meaning.
All this suggests two alternative possibilities. On the one hand, the ni in
the ‘even’ phrase might express constituent negation. If so, it is unclear just
what this negation contributes to the meaning of the construction as a whole.
On the other hand, the ni in the ‘even’ phrase might have the form but not
the meaning of negation, similar to a negative concord item. If so, it would
be agreeing with sentence negation in some new way. This is an area where
further investigation is needed.","[412, 413]"

and Māori) in not allowing affirmative imperatives to be formed from passive verbs. (The situation with negative imperatives is more complicated; see
15.2.2 below.) However, affirmative imperatives can be formed from all
other types of verbs, including antipassives (as in (4a)), applicatives (4b),
causatives (4c), and reciprocals (4d).

NEGATION
Negative sentences in Chamorro can be formed with the
sentential negative ti, a negative verb, or a syntactically
focused negative indefinite. These sentences allow negative
concord and occur in the negative ‘even’ construction.","[395, 396]"

Finally, negative sentences can be formed from a negative indefinite that
is syntactically focused—displaced to the left edge of the sentence by whmovement.
Negative indefinites in Chamorro are formed by combining the wordlevel negative ni with an indefinite noun phrase, or a prepositional phrase
whose object is an indefinite noun phrase. The indefinite noun phrase can be
a general indefinite (see 9.2.1 and 9.2.2.2) or a noun phrase introduced by
the indefinite article un, the numeral unu ‘one’, or a general indefinite used
as a determiner. Some representative negative indefinites: ni håyi ‘no (one)’,
ni håfa ‘no(thing)’, ni unu ‘no (one)’, and ni un grånu ‘not a bit’. A negative
indefinite that is syntactically focused generally expresses sentence negation,
as can be seen from the sentences below (but see note 2).

translated ‘any(thing)’, and so on.

In negative sentences
A general indefinite can combine with the word-level negative ni to form a
negative indefinite, such as ni håyi ‘no (one)’, ni håfa ‘no(thing)’, ni månu
‘no(where)’, ni ngai’an ‘never’, ni kuåntu ‘in no quantity’, and ni taimanu
‘in no way, to no degree’. These negative indefinites can serve as arguments,
adjuncts, or determiners within the noun phrase. They often undergo reduplication to indicate degree (see 25.2.1) or are followed by the emphatic
particle ha’ (see 23.2), as in ni håyiyi ha’ ‘no one’.
Negative indefinites occur only in negative sentences. They supply the
sentence negation when they are syntactically focused—displaced to the left
edge of the sentence by wh-movement (see 23.3). Some examples of syntactically focused negative indefinites are cited below.

Negative concord items can serve as adjuncts, as can be seen from (9b) and

sentence negation; ni månunu ha’ ‘not anywhere’ is a negative concord

the accidentThe ungrammaticality of (27b) also reveals that sentence negation is not
expressed by the ‘even’ phrase or by the word-level negative ni.
(ii) The ‘even’ phrase is not a negative indefinite, despite the fact that it
begins with the word-level negative ni. Negative indefinites can be formed
only from certain types of indefinites (see 17.2 and 17.3), but ‘even’ phrases385can be formed from a wider range of noun phrases, including definite noun
phrases, names, and pronouns (see (25)). Moreover, negative indefinites that
occur at the left edge of the clause are syntactically focused, but ‘even’
phrases are not. The verb does not show wh-agreement with them (see (25b)
and (27a)), and they can occur in sentences in which a different constituent
is syntactically focused (see (26b)).
(iii) The ‘even’ phrase occupies a position at the far left edge of the
negative sentence, after the complementizer (if any) but before a syntactically focused constituent (see (26b)). The fact that it can be resumed by a
weak pronoun, such as håo ‘you’ in (25c), suggests that it originates in this
left-edge position and serves as the antecedent of a subject pronoun within
the negative sentence. This pronoun can be overt, but more often it is null.
(iv) Although ‘even’ phrases are usually formed from ni plus a noun
phrase, they can also be formed from ni plus an adverbial clause, as in (28).

101)Most of the predicate’s arguments can have wide or narrow scope with
respect to sentence negation. Generally speaking, they have wide scope if
they are syntactically focused, as in (19a-b), but narrow scope otherwise, as
in (18).5 But the subject of a negative sentence always has wide scope with
respect to negation, even when it is not syntactically focused. This can be
seen from the negative sentences below, in which the noun phrase tres na
famagu’un ‘three children’ serves as the subject. Sentence negation does not
affect the reference of this noun phrase: the meaning of (20a) is that three
children have the property of not having come to the party, and the meaning
of (20b) is that three children have the property of having not been punished.
These sentences say nothing about how many children actually attended the
party or were punished. (If negation had affected the reference of tres na
famagu’un, (20a) would mean that that the number of child attendees at the
party was fewer than three. But (20a) does not mean this.)

the case for the noun phrases in boldface in the negative sentences in (19):
their reference is not changed in the meaning of the sentence as a whole.
Thus, tres na chåda’ månnuk means ‘three chicken eggs’, and the meaning
of the sentence in (19a) is that three chicken eggs have the property of not
having hatched. Todu mampus means ‘everything in excess’, and the meaning of the sentence in (19b) is that everything in excess has the property of
not being good. Finally, bubula ha’ tetenan tano’-hu means ‘there’s still
much of my remaining land’, and the meaning of the sentence in (19c) is that
much of the speaker’s remaining land has the property of not being sold.",[406]

Chamorro has several strategies for expressing the equivalent of a negative
imperative. One strategy involves the negative predicate mungnga ‘don’t’;
another involves the negative verb cha’- ‘better not, don’t’.
15.2.2.1
Mungnga
The negative mungnga ‘don’t’ can also be translated ‘let it not be’. It occurs
mainly in negative purpose clauses and in clauses that have the force of negative imperatives.
Mungnga is an invariant predicate that is not marked for aspect, mood,
or agreement with the subject. Nonetheless, like other predicates, it can be
preceded by the future TAM para, as can be seen from the negative purpose
clause in (9).
(9)In sesenggi

guaha ñåmu].
exist
mosquito
‘[If we are at the ranch at night], we (excl.) burn smudge pots so
that there won’t be any mosquitos.’ (CD, entry for oddu)
Mungnga has just one argument. That argument, which names the event
that should not happen, is realized in various ways:
(i) The argument of mungnga can be an irrealis embedded clause. Constructions of this sort have several functions. When mungnga is the predicate
of the main clause and the embedded clause has a second person subject, the
sentence has the force of a negative imperative. It directs the addressee(s)
not to do something, as in (10).
(10) a.","[367, 368]"
"17.2BasicsChamorro has three ways of creating negative sentences. The default is for
negative sentences to be formed with the sentential negative ti, which occurs
at the beginning of the clause, to the left of the tense-aspect-mood marker
and the predicate (see 4.1). Some representative examples of negative sentences formed with ti are given in (1).

Chamorro has other types of determiners beyond those described in this
chapter. In particular:
(i) The general indefinites håyi ‘who, anyone’, håfa ‘what, anything’,
and månu ‘where, anywhere, which’ can be used as determiners in interrogative noun phrases, negative polarity noun phrases, and free choice noun
phrases (noun phrases that indicate that the choice among suitable referents
is completely free). See Chapter 9.
(ii) The sentential negative ti can combine with todu ‘all’ to form the
negative determiner ti todu ‘not all’.
(82)Ti todu mana’amti manparehu amut-ñiha.
not all
PL.healer
AGR.same

‘Not all healers have the same medicine.’ (LSS 451)(iii) Negative determiners can also be formed by combining the wordlevel negative ni with the indefinite singular article un, or with a general
indefinite (see 9.2.2.2).
(iv) Finally, complex determiners can be formed by combining a comparative word with a numeral, as in (83).

Multiple expressions of negation are allowed as long as they conform to
the structure of Chamorro clauses. Specifically, no clause can begin with
more than one sentential negative ti, and no clause can have more than one
syntactically focused constituent at its left edge.","[399, 400]"

negative concord item cannot serve as the subject of a negative sentence
because then it would be too syntactically prominent to agree with the
negation. The discussion here points to a different reason why a negative
concord item cannot be the subject of a negative sentence: its scope requirements are incompatible with the scope requirements of the subject.",[408]

the dispositions, habits, or typical states of individuals or locations.

2.2.3.2.3
Interaction with negation and conditionals
Mood interacts with negation and conditionals in largely predictable ways.
In negative clauses, the choice between the realis and irrealis moods
follows the guidelines presented earlier (in 2.2.3.2.1). The realis mood is
used for situations that are actual or presented as facts; the irrealis mood is
used for situations that are not actual. Note that the situations that are used to
determine mood choice have the negation factored in.9 In (72a), for instance,
the situation of the mother’s not seeing where her son had gone is presented
as a fact, whereas in (72b), the situation of the dog’s not hurting the speaker
is presented as not actual.
9If negation were not factored in, the clause ought to be invariably in the
irrealis mood. (72a), for instance, states that the mother did not see where
her son had gone. If mood choice here was determined by the situation of the
mother’s seeing where her child had gone, then the clause should be irrealis,
because (72a) asserts that such a seeing event is not a fact.

This book has taken a long time to complete. That it exists at all is due to the
generosity of many people.
First of all, I want to acknowledge and thank the speakers of Chamorro
who have generously shared their linguistic insights with me over the years.
Manuel F. Borja has been a consultant, collaborator, friend, and member of
the family, both in Saipan and in the U.S. mainland, for almost as long as I
have been studying the Chamorro language. Of the many others who have
been willing to share their judgments and linguistic intuitions with me, I
especially want to recognize Priscilla Anderson, Antonio M. Atalig, Felix P.
Babauta, Jose A. Bermudez, Jesus M. Cruz, Teresina Garrido, Ray Lujan,
Maria T. Quinata, and the late Agnes C. Tabor (in the continental U.S.); and
Dr. Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Francisco Tomokane, the late Anicia Q.
Tomokane, and the late Maria P. Mafnas (in Saipan).
Just as important have been the energy and achievements of the people
in the CNMI who have participated in the project to revise the ChamorroEnglish dictionary. Great thanks and appreciation to the members of the core
dictionary working groups, who include: Daisy A. Quitugua, Magdalena
S.N. Mesngon, and Aniceto H. Mundo (in Rota); Ester Basa, Angelina C.
Fitial, Bertha M. Pangelinan, Arsene M. Borja, Diana H. Borja, Florine M.
Hofschneider, and Leon Masga (in Tinian); as well as Viola S. De Leon
Guerrero, Jose D.L.G. Sanchez, Bernadita P. Sanchez, the late William I.
Macaranas, Frances M. Sablan, Carmen S. Taimanao, Rosalina M. Magofna,
Bernadita P. Sablan, Esther M. San Nicholas, Maggie C. Untalan, Vicente S.
Borja, Rita C. Guerrero, Glenn H. Manglona, Jose Ch. Camacho, Ana C.
Baer, and Elizabeth D.L.G. Concepcion (in Saipan). The editors—Dr.
Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Tita A. Hocog, Manuel F. Borja, and the late Dr.

Work on this grammar has been facilitated from the beginning by the
Chamorro-Carolinian Language Policy Commission of the CNMI and thexviiiNMI Council for the Humanities. I am especially grateful to the present and
past Executive Directors and staff of the CCLPC, especially Melvin O.
Faisao, Cindy P. Reyes, Bernadita P. Sablan, and the late David Omar. I also
want to acknowledge Scott Russell and Paz C. Younis, both formerly of the
Humanities Council, for their assistance. In 2019, I spent several days in
Guam as a consultant on Dr. Robert A. Underwood and Dr. David Ruskin’s
NSF project to document the CHamoru language. Thanks to the Kumision I
Fino’ CHamoru for an enlightening discussion, and especially to Robert and
David for their hospitality.
At UC Santa Cruz, Prof. Matt Wagers has been a great colleague, friend,
collaborator, and active user of the draft chapters of this manuscript. Our
joint research, which has taught me a lot, has been a real pleasure. I owe a
special debt to Scarlett Clothier-Goldschmidt, whose research showed me
how to do electronic corpus research on Chamorro, and to Boris Harizanov,
who designed the search engine and parser for the revised dictionary. Many
thanks to Prof. Jess Law, who generously talked me through my worries
about the meaning of mampus. Many thanks also to Richard Bibbs, Steven
R. Foley, Jed Pizarro-Guevara, Jake W. Vincent, and—much earlier—to
Jeanne D. Gibson, Catherine Crain, and Ann Cooreman for their interest in
Chamorro linguistics.

Finally, all love to Jim, my daughter Anicia, and her partner Steve for
their constant support, patience, and enthusiasm. This book, which is for the
next generations of speakers of Chamorro, is also for them.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

INDEFINITE PRONOUNS
Chamorro has general indefinites—indefinite forms similar
to pronouns that serve as noun phrases or determiners, but
only in certain constructions. General indefinites serve as
interrogative words in constituent questions and as negative
indefinites in negative sentences. Noun phrase ellipsis and
implicit arguments are also used to convey the meaning of
indefinite pronouns.","[214, 215, 216]"

The null indefinite article is used in negative sentences for (non-subject)
noun phrases that have no referent—in other words, when the event or state
described has no participant that fits the description supplied by the noun
phrase. The negative sentence in (35a) states that no two-story houses existed in the old days; the negative sentence in (35b) states that no transom
was installed in the speaker’s house.

Interaction of aspect with negation
Generally speaking, negation does not have an effect on the choice of aspect:
aspect is used in the same way in negative clauses as in the corresponding
clauses without negation. The progressive is used for events that are in
progress with respect to some other event, for repeated events, and for states
that are viewed as persisting. The neutral aspect is used otherwise. In (26),
the predicate usa ‘use’ is in the progressive because it describes a repeated
action, and the predicate tungu’ ‘know’ is in the neutral aspect because it
describes a state.",[43]
"9.2General indefinites9.2.1 Form
The general indefinites in Chamorro are indefinite forms that serve as interrogative words in questions and can be used to form negative indefinites in
negative sentences. They can also occur in the antecedent clause of conditionals and in the standard of comparative sentences. Finally, they can be
used as free-choice indefinites—indefinites that imply that it does not matter
at all which referents are chosen; any suitable referent will do.
The general indefinites are listed in (1), along with the restrictions on
their use. See 9.2.2 on their meanings in the different constructions in which
they occur.",[216]

Because the negative ti is phonologically dependent—it must lean on
material to its right—it cannot be used when ellipsis removes everything in
the clause except the negation. In such cases, negation is expressed by the
interjection åhi’ ‘no’ or by the predicate mungnga ‘don’t, let it not be’.
Mungnga is used when the truncated clause is irrealis and conveys obligation or necessity (see 15.2.2.1).

Second, affirmative imperatives are usually conjoined with yan ‘and’ (see
19.2). But it is possible to use the asymmetric conjunction ya ‘and (then)’ to
conjoin an affirmative imperative clause with an irrealis clause whose
predicate shows the normal agreement with the subject (see 19.3). In such
cases, the clause formed from the imperative always precedes the irrealis
clause. The examples below have the force of conjoined imperatives, but
only the predicate on the left has the form of an imperative.

"4.1Negation, tense-aspect-mood, and word orderIn addition to the predicate, its arguments, and adjuncts, the clause can
contain two further elements: the sentential negative ti ‘not’ and a marker of
tense-aspect-mood (henceforth TAM). The TAM precedes the predicate, and
the negative ti precedes the TAM. This information is incorporated below
into the word order templates from the end of Chapter 3. (Recall that x is
used to mark the most common locations for adjuncts.)

clauses. The progressive is often used in negative clauses when an event or
state no longer holds, meaning that it does not hold at the time in question,
but had held previously. These negative clauses often include the adverb
esta ‘already’.
