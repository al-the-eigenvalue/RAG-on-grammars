1.4.1 Sentence negationA sentence can be negated either with the negative particle ba, which is
positioned before the verb, or by the use of a negative subject pronoun
from the list given in (261), all of which are proclitics on the verb.

gaapluralbaaThe phonological shape of the negative subject pronouns suggests that
they could have originated in the suppression of the initial b of the negative particle ba, at least in some of the forms, with subsequent vowel harmony: e.g. 1st person singular ma ba -+ ma a -+ ma a. I know of no case
where the two types of negation are not interchangeable, so long as there
exists a negative pronoun; however, I also know of no reason why the b of
ba should be suppressed, since b's are not otherwise weakened or lost
phonologically.
An example of sentence negation with ba is given in (262) and with
negative pronouns in (263)-(264). The negative pronouns are preferred,
when usable, but not obligatory when the subject of the sentence is a pronoun, as can be seen in (265). For further details of the negative pronouns,
see §2.1.2.1.10 below.

"However, ja can also occur at other positions in the clause, as shown
in (321), where the banging together of the foreheads of the fighting hippopotamus and elephant forms the climax (and end) of their tug-of-war.
Although it cannot easily be distinguished from constituent emphasis
of the verb only, both contradictory and non-contradictory emphasis of a
sentence can also be expressed by the use of the emphatic particle la after
the verb. 46 In contradistinction to the emphasis of an NP, the emphatic
particle in this usage cannot be replaced by the negative emphatic particle

1.4.3 More than one negation element in a sentenceIf there is more than one negation element in a sentence, the result is
negative, provided that both occur in the same clause. There is only one
case in which more than one negation element occur in a single sentence,
and that is the constituent negation described immediately above and exemplified in (268).
It is possible to negate a subordinate clause of a negative main clause,
in which case the result is positive, as shown in (270).

"1.1.1.2.1.2 Leading
1.1.1.2.1.2.1 Expecting the answer yesThe yes-no questions suggesting a positive response are formed syntactically in an identical way to the neutral yes-no questions (i.e. positive declarative sentence plus sentence-final question particle), but use different
question particles. There are two particles, kal and d:J which are used in
this type of yes-no question. Both particles are also words in their own
right: kal is a comparative particle meaning 'rather' or 'more (than)', and
d:J is the negative copula or emphatic particle (corresponding to the positive particle La). The examples given in (17}--(22) correspond to those in
the (positive) declarative sentences (5)-(10) and the neutral questions
(11)-( 16). Note that the position of the question particle (always sentencefinal) is the same in all types of yes-no questions. Here, only examples
with kal have been given; the examples with d:J are identical when the
question particle is switched.

this should be so, though I suspect that the reason must be prosodic.
In negative imperative sentences, the sentence-initial negative particle

(corresponding to positive wE), which are described in the respective subsections of § 1.2.1.1 above.",[134]
"2.1.1.4.19.5 Partitive negative quantifierAs with the other partitives described here, the negative partitive quantifier has a set-subset structure. The negative particle baa precedes the subset NP, and that NP has the quantifier 'one' (expressible in various ways
such as the numeral quantifiers dom or dole, or the disjunctive numeral
gad:Jm). Examples are given in (430}-(43 1). Note that in (431) the topic
NP is (optionally) singular. This is only possible with the negative partitive, not with the positive partitive.

a manner similar to the subset NPs with a partitive negative, i.e. by the use
of the negative particle baa and the numeral 'one'. An example is given in
(432). However, it is also possible to have an 'article + noun' structure and
simply negate the verb, as in (433).",[200]
"1.4.4 Attraction of negation elements to the coordinator positionThe negation elements in coordinated structures are never attracted to any
other position.
100Syntax1.4.5 Negation of a verb in a subordinate clause by the negation of the
verb of a higher clauseNegation quite typically moves up from subordinate clauses towards the
front of the sentence. This movement can go through more than one
clause. Examples were given in (263)-(264) above, where 'I think that not
X' is optionally expressed as 'I do not think that X'. However, this can
only work if a single negative noun clause is embedded in a positive
clause (or series of clauses - cf. §1.4.3 above). Sentences (271)-(273)
show each stage of this kind of movement; the middle stage, i.e. (272),
seems to be less usual than the other two.

1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1 Wordsfor yes', 'no', 'maybe'
The words for 'yes' and 'no' in Koromfe vary slightly (stylistically?) in
their phonetic realization - I have therefore transcribed them in greater
phonetic detail than usual. Also, these words are accompanied by a distinctive intonation pattern, which I have marked with high and low tone
marks, where appropriate, in the examples given here. It seems that the
most important thing about these words is that when disyllabic, 'yes' always has a rising tone pattern (LH) and 'no' a falling pattern (HL).

"With the positive leading questions, 'yes' means agreement with the

In general, I have not noticed any unexpected use of 'yes' or 'no' in
Koromfe vis-a-vis English usage.
1.1.1.2.4.2.2 Question-word questions
When considering the reduction of answers to wh-questions it is practical
to treat questioned noun-phrases and prepositional phrases separately from
questioned verbs.
1.1.1.2.4.2.2.1 Questioned noun phrases and prepositional phrases
As mentioned above, the answer to a wh-questioned noun-phrase normally
involves emphasis with the emphatic particle la (or dJ, if negative). If the
answer is a full sentence, the answer element is emphasized (Le. moved to
the front of the main clause and followed by la). An example question is
given in (75) and its full answer in (76).

"38SyntaxImperative sentences formed with the conjunction ke have the syntactic structure of normal indicative sentences, but with ke in sentence-initial
position. Thus they show all person and number forms, some of which are
exemplified in (92)-(95). It seems that this construction is considered by
speakers to originate in reported speech, especially since there is no special verb corresponding to English 'command, order'; in Koromfe one can
either 'say' or 'wish', and this is construed as a command. See § 1.1.2.2.5.

apart from the usual polite formulations such as 'Would you be so kind as
to .. .' .
1.1.1.3.2 The negative imperative/armsThe negative imperative is formed in the same way as the positive imperatives that use ke, but introduced by the negative conjunction ka instead of
the ke; in this case, an overt 2nd person subject (proclitic or disjunctive) is
obligatory and the 2pL. subject na must precede the verb (in contrast with
the true positive imperative, where na follows the verb). This construction
is identical with the indirect negative command (cf. §1.1.2.2.5. below).","[73, 74]"

There are no different degrees of negative imperative, therefore
§ 1.1.1.3 .2.2 is inapplicable.
1.1.1.3.3 Other means ofexpressing the above types of imperativeThere are no other direct, structural means of expressing the above types
of imperative, but see § 1.1.2.2.5. below on indirect commands.
1.1.1.4 Other distinct sentence-typesThere are no other structurally distinct sentence-types.
1.1.1.5 Sentence-types used regularly in functions other than their normal
onesOne (rare) type of imperative sentence has the structure of a declarative
sentence (cf. § 1.1.1.3 and § 1.1.1.3 .1.1 above).
As in many other languages, an imperative clause can be used as a
conditional clause, as shown in (98). In this construction in Koromfe,
there is nothing at the clause boundary (here: between tasgu and ma)
which corresponds to the and of English (although there is a clear pause
intonation). However, the juxtaposition of clauses with no overt coordinator is a normal construction (cf. § 1.3 below).","[74, 75]"
"1.11.2.2.1.3 VerbsEmphasis of the verb using the VERB
La (positive) or VERB
d:J
(negative) structure (without movement) is also used for sentential emphasis and can hardly be distinguished from it. See § 1.11.1 above for details.
There exist no other ways of emphasizing a verb (except of course by
the use of adverbials such as handa 'really').
1.11.2.2.1.4 AdverbialsAdverbs and pre-/postpositional phrases can be emphasized using the
same mechanism as NPs, i.e. addition of a final particle La (positive) or d:J
(negative) and movement of the whole emphasized constituent to sentence-initial position. One example of each type is given below: a simple
adverb in (344), a postpositional phrase in (345), and a prepositional

1.2.5.2.5.21)eicticThe modifier nand! (HUMAN SINGULAR), which inflects for number and
humanness, but not DIMINUTIVE, follows the noun phrase which it qualifies
and is referentially deictic (within the discourse), e.g. a b:JrJ nand! 'that
man (that we've just been talking about)"" a kEna namba 'those women'. It
requires an NP-initial article.
The deictic modifier na1Jsa is strongly deictic, and often accompanied
by some physical pointing or explanatory gesture. This modifier follows
the (rest of the) noun phrase to which it applies, and does not occur in
conjunction with relative clauses (or other intervening modifiers). It does
not normally allow an NP-initial article/ 3 and has a fixed (i.e. noninflected) phonological form, e.g. bJrJ na1Jsa 'that man over there', da1J
na1Jsa 'that house over there'. The lack of inflection seems to indicate that
the word na1Jsa may be an adverb, and therefore comparable to flE1Jgt:
'thus, like that', dealt with in §1.2.5.2.7 below.
1.2.5.2.6 QuantifiersQuantifiers follow the noun which they quantify in a position intermediate
between contentful adjectives (to the left of the quantifiers) and any
DETERMINER or DEICTIC that may be present (to their right). Numerals
precede other quantifiers. Some simpler examples, with universal quantification, are: e.g. a bJrJ doro 'every man', a benna doro 'all men', a kE5
doro 'every woman', a kEna doro 'all women'. The quantifier doro can
also be used with (clitic) pronouns, e.g. 0 doro 'all ofus'.
The zero quantifier is syntactically quite complex and also, incidentally, involves the only case of double negation in Koromfe. For countable
nouns, a noun phrase 'no X' usually has the structure baa X dom, where
baa is the (prenominal long variant of the) NEGATIVE PARTICLE 34 and dom
is the attributive CARDINAL NUMERAL 'one'. The verb is also negated
(either by repeating the NEGATIVE PARTICLE ba preverbally, or by the use of
a negative pronoun). Examples are given in (228)-(229).

"1.1.1.2.1.2.2 Expecting the answer noYes-no questions which expect the answer no have the structure of a
negative declarative sentence, plus a sentence-final question particle. The

1.2.1.1.3.1 The be-copulaThere exist different, but still obligatory be-copulas for adverbial local
adverbial complements; the copulas la (positive) and d:J (negative) cannot
be used. Instead, the verb WE is used in the appropriate inflectional form.
In contrast with La and d:J, which have no other inflectional forms, this
verb has all inflectional forms apart from a gerund, although the PAST and
UNMARKED forms are homophonous (for quite regular phonological reasons: the -t: suffix merges with the stem vowel e). The negative counterpart
of WE is 1)go or 1)gose, which has only these two forms (the first being
UNMARKED and the second probably PAST). As with La and d:J, the positive
verb WE cannot be used with a negative pronoun or particle; instead, 1)go
must be used.
1.2.1.1.3.2 Marking a/the complement adverbialThe complement adverbial has no special marking.
1.2.1.1.3.3 The order a/the constituentsThe order of constituents is NP-COPULA-ADVERBIAL, exemplified in (177)(181). The adverbial can optionally be emphasized, giving the structure

"151Morphology
2.1.1.2.5 Indirect objectThe indirect object NP is positioned after the verb, and has no morphological inflection. On the relative order of direct and indirect object NPs,
see § 1.2.1.2.3 above.
The following categories do not exist in Koromfe and are therefore not
expressed by any means: §2.1.1.2.6 object of comparison, §2.1.1.2.7 object of equation, §2.1.1.2.8 other objects governed by verbs.
2.1.1.2.9 Complement ofa copular constructionThe complement of a copular construction is not marked in any special
way. It normally follows the copula, but can optionally precede the copulas la (positive) or d:J (negative) - see §2.1.1.2.3 above. No distinction is
made between copular complements which express a definition, identity,
role or copular complements of other verbs - therefore §2.1.1.2.9.1-4 are
inapplicable.
The categories subject-complement, object-complement, object governed
by an adjective, agent in passive/pseudopassive/impersonal constructions
do not exist, therefore §2.1.1.2.1 0-13 are inapplicable.
2.1.1.2.14 Topic NPThe topic is not marked morphologically, but the topic NP is leftdislocated (cf. §1.12 above).
2.1.1.2.15 Emphasized NPThe emphasized NP is followed by the emphatic particle la (positive) or d:J
(negative) and moved to clause-initial position. No (other) morphological
marking occurs (cf. § 1.11 above).
2.1.1.3 The expression ofsyntactic functions in non-finite clausesThe only non-finite clauses which occur involve gerunds / action nouns as
the noun of a genitival NP+N compound NP (described in §2.3.1.1.3 below).
The only syntactic functions which can be expressed in the NP of such
an NP+GERUND structure is that of the direct object, as in (383). Therefore152Morphology
the other syntactic functions covered in the sub-sections of §2.1.1.2 for
finite clauses do not occur in non-finite clauses.

"1.1.1.2.2 Question-word questionsThere are two basic types ofwh-questions: those in which the (constituent
containing the) wh-element is moved to the beginning of the clause (main
or embedded), and those in which the wh-element remains at its original
position in the sentence (in situ wh-questions).
1.1.1.2.2.1 Elements of the sentence that can be questionedInterrogative main clauses in Koromfe normally have the wh-word or
phrase in initial position, and no overt marking of the position which it
would occupy in the corresponding indicative sentence. The wh-word or
phrase is optionally followed by the emphatic particle lao I have found no
case where the presence or absence of la is obligatory. The negative emphatic particle d:J cannot be used in this way.
Interrogative main clauses with the wh-element in situ are rare except
in echo-questions (see §1.1.1.2.3. below).
1.1.1.2.2.1.1 Constituents of the main clauseAny NP or PP of a main clause can be questioned. The verb or VP can
only be questioned indirectly (see (39) below). Adverbial questions are
restricted to 'where', 'when' and 'how', plus the questioning of the postposition in a PP. Other adverbial questions such as 'why' involve questioned NPs.
The following examples show the questioning of a whole noun-phrase
as subject (31), direct object (32)-(33) and indirect object (34).",[52]
"313Morphology
2.1.8.1.3 Reflexive pronounsThe reflexive pronouns, where used (often a bare verb has a reflexive
meaning) are non-clitic, consisting of the word gIllt: 'self' with a prefixal
possessive clitic pronoun, e.g. dd gille 'himself'.
2.1.8.1.4 Reciprocal pronounsThe reciprocal pronoun dombi\, which is in fact the plural of the noun
dono 'comrade', is not a clitic, but behaves syntactically and morphologically like any other common noun.
2.1.8.1.5 A uxiliary verbsThere are no clitic auxiliary verbs; there is no morphological class of auxiliary verbs as distinct from full verbs - in other words, every verb which
is used as an auxiliary also has its own meaning as a full verb.
2.1.8.1.6 Sentence particlesThere are two types of particle which might be considered sentence particles: the sentence-final interrogative particles and the preverbal negative
particles (ba and arguably also aa). The interrogative particles are described in § 1.1.1.2.1 and the negative particles in § 1.4.1. I do not consider
the (apparently) sentence-initial particle handa of the yes-no question
echo-questions in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 to be truly sentence-initial, but rather to be
an ellipsis of something like n handa bole ke ... 'Did you really say that...',
where handa is a pre-verbal adverb (cf. § 1.2.1.3 .2.1 above).
2.1.8.1.7 Sentence connectivesThe element b which is described in § 1.1.2.3.2 above as a sentential relative pronoun might instead be considered to be a sentence connective. It is
the only such element in Koromfe.
2.1.8.1.8 Anaphoric particlesThere are no anaphoric particles.
2.1.8.1.9 Others
2.1.8.1.9.1 Possessive adjectivesThe possessive adjective clitics are formally identical with the subject
clitics found on verbs. The non-clitic (disjunctive or free) pronouns can
314Morphologyalso be used. Sentences (716)-{717) were the first two uttered to me in
Koromfe by my informant Souleymane; the first contains the disjunctive
possessive adjective mab, the second the clitic possessive adjective mao

"'I think that he ate millet porridge - he didn't upset it. '1.11.2.1 Constituent emphasis (contrastive and non-contrastive)Since emphasis of the verb and sentential emphasis are indistinguishable
and were dealt with in the previous two sections, the rest of this section
and its sub-sections is concerned with emphasized nominal (including
adjectival) and adverbial constituents.
I have discovered no case where a formal distinction is made between
contrastive and non-contrastive emphasis. An emphasized noun phrase or
adverbial is positioned at the beginning of the sentence and is followed by
123Syntaxthe emphatic particle lao When it is added as a post-sentential afterthought
it can be regarded as an elliptical sentence consisting of the emphasized
constituent only - and therefore also in sentence-initial position.
1.11.2.1.1 Stress/accentThe sentence-initial emphasized constituent usually bears the strongest
stress and highest pitch in the sentence by default. The device of contrastive constituent stress (i.e. higher pitch) can be used, but is relatively rare;
the other syntactic devices of emphasis and topicalization are preferred.
1.11.2.1.2 ParticlesConstituent emphasis, like sentence emphasis, is expressed with the emphatic particle lao But unlike sentence (or verb) emphasis, the negative
emphatic dJ can also be used, in which case the sentence has the meaning
'it isn't X that...'. The emphatic particle follows the emphasized constituent, and together they are moved to sentence-initial position.
1.11.2.1.3 Movement (without dis location) of the emphasized element
1.11.2.1.3.1 Movement to initial positionThe emphasized NP is moved to clause-initial position (but follows the
topic NP, if there is one). This emphasized NP almost always has an emphatic particle, but cf. § 1.11.2.2.1.1, examples (333)-(336) for one problematic text where the narrator sometimes omits the emphatic particle.
1.11.2.1.3.2 Movement to final positionMovement to final position does not occur, except in an 'afterthought'
structure, which I consider to be a separate elliptical sentence.
1.11. 2.1. 3. 3 Movement to preverbal positionThere is no movement of an emphasized element to preverbal position, but
an emphasized subject NP is in preverbal position from the outset.
1.11.2.1.3.4 Movement to other positionsThere is no movement of an emphasized element to any other position.
1.11.2.1.4 CleftingClefting does not occur.
124Syntax
1.11.2.1.5 PseudocleftingIn pseudoclefting, the emphasized constituent is moved to sentence-initial
position and followed by the copula (positive La or negative dJ) and then a
relative clause introduced by k5N. Examples are given in (325)-(327).48

Noun phrases also permit a 'not X but Y' structure using the emphatic
particles d:J (negative) and fa (positive), as shown in (252). Such a structure must always be disjoint, with the 'but Y' part as a post-sentential
afterthought.

1.2.1.1.1 Copular sentences with nominal complement
1.2.1.1.1.1 The be-copulasThere exist two overt be-copulas: la (positive) and dJ (negative), and they

1.2.1.1.1.2 Marking of the predicate nounThere is no special marking on the predicate noun.
1.2.1.1.1.3 The order of the constituentsIn a non-topicalized, non-emphatic sentence, the order of constituents is
NP t -copula-NP2, whereby NP t is usually the subject of the copula and NP2
its complement, as shown in (160). However, when the subject is a personal pronoun, the order of subject and complement can be reversed: (161)

"2.1.8.2 Positions occupied by the clitics
2.1.8.2.1 PreverbalThe preverbal position is occupied by personal pronoun subject clitics. See
§2.1.8.1.1 for details. If a negative particle is present, it intervenes between the subject and the verb, as do the adverbs handa 'really' and da 'in
the past' (cf. §1.2.1.3.2.1).
2.1.8.2.2 PostverbalThe suffixal personal pronoun clitics occupy the postverbal position when
they are the object (direct or indirect) or the complement of the verb (see
§2.1.8.1.1 for details).
2.1.8.2.3 Sentence-finalThe interrogative particles of the various types of yes-no questions
(described in § 1.1.1.2.1) occupy the sentence-final position.
2.1.8.2.4 Sentence-initialThe only clitic, if such it is, which occupies the sentence-initial position is
the sentential relative or sentence connective b described in § 1.1.2.3.2
above.
2.1.8.2.5 Sentence-second positionThere are no clitics (or anything else) in Koromfe which occupy the sentence-second position.",[350]
"'Then Hippo also said: ""He cheated me too, telling me to bring my child, and
saying that he would raise him outdoors (=on land), (and) he would give (him
back to me).'""In sentence (3) the conjunction ke is used immediately before an exclamation which is a part of the directly quoted speech; in (4), on the other
hand, there is no ke even though the immediately following sentence is a
part of Hippo's speech (being directly quoted by the narrator). The ke of
11Syntaxthe following clause is analysable as introducing either embedded indirectly quoted speech (what Rabbit had said to Hippo), or an indirect imperative ( 'I ought to bring my child ').
The quoted speech itself is not marked morphologically or syntactically except by the usual 'deictic shifts' of pronouns, adverbials, etc. that
are made in indirect speech. No significant changes of the verb form take
place in directly or indirectly quoted speech.
1.1.1.2 Interrogative sentencesThe typical intonation pattern for all types of question in Koromfe is not
normally distinct from that of statements (cf. §3.3.4.1.1-2 below), i.e. a
high pitch at the beginning of the sentence, followed by a gradual fall of
pitch up to the end of the question. This means that in general all question
words at the beginning of a sentence are on a high pitch, and all yes-no
question particles at the end of a sentence have a low pitch. In addition,
the high pitch on the sentence-initial wh-e1ement remains at a constant
high pitch on the whole syntactic constituent.
Optionally, the sentence-final question particle can be on a high pitch
or lengthened, in which case the question is especially emphasized.
1.1.1.2.1 Yes-no questions
1.1.1.2.1.1 NeutralNeutral yes-no questions in Koromfe are formed by adding a sentencefinal question particle (glossed as QUEST. below) to a (positive) declarative
sentence. There is no inversion or other change in the linear order of the
sentence constituents. A set of typical declarative sentences with varying
numbers and types of noun phrases are given in (5}--(10), and the corresponding neutral yes-no questions in (11}--( 16).

1.2.1.1.6 Different types of copulaThe only distinction between the types of copula described above is that

complement. Otherwise, la and its negative counterpart dJ are used for all
copula functions, including defining, identity and role (i.e. § 1.2.1.1.6.1-3).
In addition, there is a verb km:tam 'become', exemplified in (183)(184), and a vast variety of adjectival verbs with the meaning 'be X' and

"1.11.2.1.6 Dislocation
1.11.2.1.6.1 Left dislocationConstituents which are left-dislocated to the sentence-initial position (but
have no emphatic particle) do exist, but are what I consider to be the topic
of the sentence - though clearly there are many cases where one could
consider the topic of the sentence to be emphasized. (Cf. also § 1.11.2.2.1.1
below.) However, such constituents do not always have a position within
the sentence from which they could be said to have been moved (i.e. the
topic can be virtually anything), and when they do have a structural position within the sentence, this position is filled with some pronominal element. See § 1.12 below for details of topics.
To show that topics are distinct from, and compatible with, emphasized constituents, sentences (328)-{329) show how they can be combined. Note that the topic constituent takes precedence over the emphasized constituent (i.e. is always in absolute sentence-initial position). (The
topic NP is glossed as 'as for X' and the pause-like dislocation intonation
is transcribed with a dash '-'.) In (328) we have a topic NP followed by a
125Syntaxpseudoclefted emphasized subject NP and in (329) followed by an emphatic particle. Comparison of these two sentence types shows that the
homophony of the COPULAS and the EMPHATIC particles, both positive and
negative, cannot be a coincidence. 50

3.3.2.2 The phonetic correlates of stress
3.3.2.2.1 Word stressIn general, a stressed syllable is louder than an unstressed syllable. Word
stress is not expressed by pitch changes; these indicate phrasal stress or
the intonational peak. Stress is always located on the first syllable of a
word. The pitch pattern of a phrasally or intonationally stressed word is
usually rising from the first to the second syllable, then falling, so that the
highest pitch of the phrase or intonation pattern is the second syllable of
the stressed word.
However, the difference in amplitude and tone between, say the two
syllables of the word [gote] 'stream' is minimal. In word lists the informants sometimes strike up a 'slight fall' tone pattern with roughly equal
amplitude, or sometimes a 'slight rise' pattern accompanied by a slight
drop in amplitude. Syllables containing schwa are considerably weaker
than full vowel syllables.
3.3.2.2.2 Phrase stressOn the phrase level, there is maximally a single stress which can be assigned to a noun phrase or an adverb-verb group,63 both for normal and for
contrastive stressing. This phrasal stress is expressed by a high tone on the
final full-vowel syllable of the first stressable word in the phrase.
A negative marker, if present, always receives the stress of the adverbverb group, expressed as a higher tone. This means that if the verb is a
PROGRESSIVE form or verbal adjective with a final long faa!, this is shortened to a single short [a].
Typically, nouns, verbs, adjectives (of both types) or adverbs carry
phrasal stress, but other word types, i.e. the 'grammatical' words (apart
from the sentence-final yes-no question particles) do not. Proclitic weak
pronouns are not stressable, but strong (disjunctive) pronouns with the
'dummy' word stem -b are. The article a which precedes almost every
word of a word list has a considerably lower amplitude and lower tone
than the following noun. Post-nominal DETERMINERS or DEICTICS such as
h01J (HUM. SG.) are also quieter and on a lower tone than the noun which
they qualify. Conjunctions and relative pronouns introducing a subordinate
clause are never stressed.
In all types of complex NP the first element normally receives the
phrasal stress (higher tone) - unless some other part of the compound is
430Phonology
contrastively stressed. This seems to be responsible for the shortening of
the word saa 'owner' to [sa] when it is the second element of a compound
NP.
3.3.2.3 Levels o/stress
For both words and phrases there are no phonologically relevant levels of
stress above and beyond the distinction of stressed and unstressed (for full
vowels) and that of full (i.e. potentially stressable) vs. schwa (i.e. unstressable) vowels at the word level. Of course, phonetically the pattern of
sharp pitch rises and gradual falls produces an almost infinite number of
pitches.
3.3.2.4 The position o/stress when constant
The position of stress is constant at the word level: on the first syllable of
the word.
3.3.2.5 The position 0/ stress when mobile
At the phrase level the position of stress (expressed by a single high tone)
is constant as described in §3.3.2.2 above unless any word in the phrase is
contrastively stressed (in which case it receives the high tone).
3.3.2.6 Exceptional stress patterns in loan-words
The stress pattern of loans form Moore is identical to that of native
Koromfe word~.
However, loans from French, especially when used by
However,
more educated speakers, seem to have longer and (slightly) louder final
syllables than native Koromfe words. Nevertheless, the difference m
prominence between the individual full-vowel syllables is quite small.
3.3.3 PitchPitch is not used to distinguish lexical items, and Koromfe has no linguistic tones of any kind. This point is very important because most related
languages do have linguistic tones: Moore, for example, has two register
tones and automatic downstep (cf. Rennison, 1987c). However, I have
checked this point repeatedly and even went to the trouble of learning to
hear the tones of Moore and analysing its tone system. Koromfe definitely
has no linguistic tones.","[464, 465, 466]"
"'It's a black one, the cat that I saw.' (incorrect)Because the adjective cannot be emphasized alone, using the NEGATIVE
EMPHATIC particle d:J in place of La in sentence (339) negates the whole NP

gaThe prefixal variant of h6 results from the dropping of a word-initial h

exactly the same processes, but with a back rather than a front vowel.
244MorphologyThe prefixal variant of the 2nd person singular form n is syllabic
phrase-initially and assimilated to the place of articulation of the following
consonant (hence the capital N in table (573)), but is realized as phonetic
[n] in the suffixal variant. The vowel [E] of the suffixal variant results from
the general phonological process of phrase-final filling (cf. §3.2.6.4.2.2
below), which gives an I colouring to a phrase-final unspecified vowel
(final phonetic [n] being impossible in polysyllabic words) and of lowering after the nasal consonant.
There also exists an incomplete set of negative prefixal pronouns,
mentioned in §1.4.1 above and given again in (575), which can only be
used as the (prefixed) subject of a verb (which then has a negated reading).

prefix pronouns consist of a single vowel, and the 2nd singular and 2nd
plural forms would be indistinguishable (both presumably being realized
as *naa). Similarly, the 3rd singular diminutive form would be indistinguishable from the 3rd singular human form gaa. The last lacuna, the 3rd
plural diminutive is already present in the positive pronoun paradigm.
My informants denied the existence of aa as a negative particle, but
there are two sentences, given in (576)-(577), in different texts of my
collection, which seem to have it (with subjects other than the prefix pronoun).

"464Phonology
555657585960616263The evidence of word lists is therefore only oflimited use, since it is impossible to
tell whether a final vowel which complies to the restrictions of colour harmony is
lexically present or absent. Thus, for example, the final vowel of [boko] 'shoulder'
is in fact the vowel of the noun class suffix -go, and is lexical, while that of [hoko]
'throw!' is epenthetic. The lexical vowel of [boko] 'shoulder' can optionally drop
in medial positions; the vowel of [hoko] 'throw!' obligatorily never occurs in
phrase-medial positions.
In GP nothing needs to be inserted, because an empty nucleus is already present at
the end of every consonant-final word. (Koromfe has only a single position in the
rime, i.e. the non-branching nucleus.) This final empty nucleus (FEN) is parametrically licensed morpheme-finally (and therefore also word-finally), but not phrasefinally except after the onset consonants [m,n,IJ,I]. Why should this be so? The
general preference of languages for open syllables is overridden in Koromfe (and,
incidentally, also Moore) by the licensing of phrase-medial final consonants. This
in turn increases robustness by signalling to the hearer that the phonological phrase
is not finished and therefore parsing must continue.
Whether the. properties of frontness and backness are transmitted directly from VI
to V3 or indirectly via V2 can not be decided on the basis of any empirical data that
I know of.
A handful of realizations of the tense variant of the postposition nE sound like [ne]
in my recordings; but the overwhelming majority are [ni]. This always contrasts
with the lax mid vowel (i.e. the form [nE]) but never with a lax high vowel (i.e. a
form *[m]).
The durative suffix in the words given here is nasalized after a preceding nasal
consonant or vowel. In [doyom5] 'cut' the expected geminate [mm] resulting from
the assimilation of /m+d/ is simplified to a single [m] in this position (i.e. after the
2nd vowel of the word); after the 1st vowel of the word, a geminate surfaces as in
[d5mm5] 'bite'.
Due to this phonological process, all DURATIVE verb forms that take the suffix -f
automatically have the phrase-final vowel [0] or [u]. This might tempt us to consider the shape of the suffix itself to be -fa. However, the ease with which thus [0]
or [u] vowel is lost in medial positions shows that it cannot be lexically present,
despite the fact that (phrase-finally) the shape of the suffix is phonetically invariant.
The apparent crossing of association lines in (853) is an artefact of the twodimensional graphical representation here. Colour harmony emanating from vowels 'takes place' on the nucleus projection, where consonants are 'invisible'. Nevertheless the question arises why the association to U in [werem5] is stronger than
the (potential) association to 1.
Since Koromfe has no branching syllable constituents, this is hardly surprising; a
long glide would have to straddle an empty nucleus without filling it.
By adverb-verb group I mean the finite verb of a sentence, plus the small adverbs
or particles which can precede the verb (in a position between the subject NP and
the verb). Such adverbs/particles include in particular both types of negative
marker, i.e. the disjunctive negative particle [ba] and the series of negative personal
pronouns with a final long [a:]. I use the word 'group' rather than 'phrase' to avoid465Phonology64
6566
6768697071727374confusion with verb-phrases proper, which are much larger than this 'adverb-verb
group'.
There is a pause of about 1 second at the clause boundary, i.e. between [nil and
[dg].
There exist two versions of this sentence in my texts. This one is the first, and has
a weak 2sg. pronoun before [bo]; the second has a strong pronoun [I)b], and therefore a rise in pitch on the syllable [b].
In particular, silent empty nuclei which are never realized as optional schwa are
ignored for the purpose of this classification of phonological processes.
Strictly speaking, any vowel following another vowel in Koromfe has an intervening empty nucleus; however, since a) our present purposes are purely descriptive
and b) a long-distance process of nasalization also exists, we will gloss over this
point.
The lax variant [hE] of the -hi plural suffix of the deverbal instrument nouns undergoes lowering in the lax form, but not nasalization, since a) it is lexically nasal
and b) there is no local source for nasalization. The tense version of the same suffix, [hi], on the other hand, does not undergo either process.
The -I suffix of the gull noun class is lowered to [e] after a nasal consonant, but not
nasalized; after a nasal vowel it undergoes both processes, producing phonetic [E].
In my corpus there are a handful of realizations of the tense variant of the postposition ne which sound like [ne]. However, the overwhelming majority of cases
have [ni]. Similarly for the plural deverbal instrument noun suffix hi: a few [he]
realizations occur, but the normal realization is [iii].
It is extremely difficult to assess the degree of nasality of the vowel [e] after nasal
consonants, since the 'oral' version of this and all other vowels is slightly nasal in
a nasal environment. I therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the vowel leI
does indeed nasalize here. However, the nasal [E] which follows a nasal vowel, as
in [t3E] 'bees; honey' sounds much more nasal, as do the long final [EEl's mentioned later in this section.
The only word with such a shape, the plural of [jirvTItu], PL. [jirvinu] 'coal, charcoal' has such an unusual and unique phonetic shape that it must be a loan
(probably from Moore).
No -:J class suffix occurs on a vowel-final word stem; recall that the deverbal agent
nouns are formed from the DURATIVE stem of the verb, which has a consonantal
suffix - either -d or-f.
This word also has variants with a non-lowered final vowel: [wEi] and (less frequent) [w1ii]. However, their existence shows that the lexical vowel here must be
high and not mid.
This word and a few others (including words in the -gull class) have an irregular
alternation of a stem-final velar nasal [I)] in the singular with a labial nasal [m] in
the plural. Apart from PAST verb forms, the word-final sequences [l)e]/[l)e] and [l)i]1
[I)I] are completely missing from the language; I therefore assume that the lexical
shape of these words has a velar nasal, and that the labial is derived. However,
there are too few words to warrant calling this stem alternation an active process of
the language. Other words of this type are given in the following table. The word
[wanal)] also has an alternative plural [wania].","[499, 500, 501]"

This word is a Moore loan; my informants knew no native Koromfe equivalent.
The word fei is probably a participially used UNMARKED form of the verb felei

The morpheme aa is found especially in combination with the proclitic subject

(optionally), comitative (optionally) and instrumental (optionally) arguments. The benefactive is expressed by the postposition ne (exemplified in
the previous subsection), and the comitative and instrumental are both
expressed with the preposition lao It is difficult to construct a sentence in
which comitative and instrumental co-occur.
70Syntax
1.2.1.2.5 Combinations of subject, direct object, indirect object, and other
argumentsKoromfe sentences require a subject, but are quite free in allowing (or
allowing the omission of) all other verb arguments. In example (197)
above we saw that a verb such as 'give' does not require a direct object
even when an indirect object and benefactive are present (unlike English).
I would go as far as to say that any semantically and pragmatically feasible
combination of verb arguments is permissible in Koromfe (pace the
obligatory status of the subject). In example (4) at the beginning of this
chapter, the final word pa 'give' has no overt object of any kind.
Since the order of the constituents for the combination of verb, subject, and direct object is given in the relevant sections above, § 1.2.1.2.6 is
omitted.
1.2.1.3 Adverbials
1.2.1.3.1 Occurring and non-occurring types ofadverbial
1.2.1.3.1.1 AdverbsAdverbs occur, but they are only a small lexical class, since there is no
class of adjectives from which they might be derived (as in English). Instead, there are nominal or verbal adjectives, neither of which permits the
formation of or use as an adverb. Also, there is no clear boundary between
adverbs and exclamations (including phonologically irregular elements).
Many adverbs, particularly of manner, are typically repeated (sometimes
more than once), such as b:JI b:JI 'slowly', sene sene 'at the bottom', tau tau
'fast', wele wele 'fast'. (Cf. §2.2.4.4 below on reduplication.)
1.2.1.3.1.2 Prepositional or postpositional phrasesBoth occur. Prepositions are the more restricted class, being limited to la
'with' (COMITATNE and INSTRUMENTAL) and hal 'up to, as far as' .
1.2.1.3.1.3 Cases of noun phrasesKoromfe has no cases. However, the universally quantified adverbs tike
duru 'everywhere' and s55ne duru 'always, every time' are plain noun
phrases (comprising the nouns tike 'place + SG.' and s55ne 'time + SG.'
plus the quantifier duru 'all') with no pre- or postposition. Other temporal
adverbials derived from noun phrases, which normally take the preposition
71Syntax
la, may optionally omit this preposition; local adverbials, on the other
hand, always keep their postposition.
1.2.1.3.1.4 Adverbial clausesFinite adverbial clauses occur, and are described in § 1.1.2.4.2 above. Nonfinite adverbial clauses also occur, and are restricted to PPs containing
gerunds or deverbal action nouns. They are described in § 1.1.2.4.3 above.
1.2.1.3.2 The positional possibilities for adverbials within the sentence
1.2.1.3.2.1 AdverbsAdverbs fall into three distinct classes on distributional grounds, and each
class has related semantic characteristics. (Note that clause-final in the
following sub-sections excludes the sentence-final yes-no question particles, which are always the very last thing in a sentence.)
1.2.1.3.2.1.1 Pre-verbal verbal adverbsThis class of adverbs includes the adverbs da 'in the past', handa 'truly' ,28
and occurs before the (first) finite verb of a clause (with the exception of
handa when used as an exclamation outside normal sentence structure cf. the pre-sentential echo-question usage of handa in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 above).
This is also the position where the negative particle ba occurs when it
qualifies the verb. In the rare event that more than one of these co-occur,
they have the order handa - da - ba.
Sentence (201) below contains an example of da. The adverb handa is
exemplified in (200).

"Although it would be hypothetically possible to form compound ordinal numerals above 1000, my informants refused to do so because there is
no ordinal numeral for 1000 itself. A form such as *tusnmdagu was not
accepted.
2.1.6.5 Other derivatives of numeralsThe only other regular derivative of numerals are the expressions denoting
the number of repetitions, as in English twice, three times (thrice), four
times ... , which are formed with a noun-like element nm followed by an
attributive cardinal numeral from 2 upwards. The formation of the numerals follows the normal pattern given in §2.1.6.1 above and is therefore not
repeated here. A few examples are given in (709). Note that the I at the
end of naI cannot be the numeral-initial class prefix mentioned in
§2.1.6.1.1 above because a) this drops when the numeral is used attributively, and b) numerals above 9 have no such class prefix, but these numerals do (e.g. naI bbaga 'a hundred times').

only way to express the notion of 'once' in Koromfe is with the (obvious
Moore loan) word vuugn.
There exists a temporal adverb somhIT 'the day before yesterday'
which clearly contains the numeral hIT 'two', but there are no parallel
309Morphologyforms with other numerals, and the sam part of this compound is opaque,
the closest related word being S5:JnE, PL. s5:Jja meaning 'period of time'
(though not necessarily a day).
2.1.6.6 The quantifiersApart from the numeral '1', dam, which is used in conjunction with the
negative particle baa to express the zero quantifier 'no', there are
(lexically) only three general quantifiers in Koromfe, given in (710), plus
a Moore paraphrase of one of them (faa for doro, occurring only in the
double quantifier doro faa, of which there are several tokens in only one
text). I have glossed kaa / kama as 'every, all' because this quantifier occurs mainly with singular and rarely with plural nouns, whereas doro 'all,
every' occurs equally freely with singular and plural nouns. The forms kaa
and kama are free variants; the former seems to be used more frequently.

syntax of the quantifiers is described in §1.2.S.2.6 and §2.1.1.4.19 above.
The quantifier doro is also used adverbially in several meanings: a)
'only, alone' in the first reading of (711), where the scope of doro is n
'you', b) 'and that's all' in the second reading of(711), where the scope of
doro is the whole clause n den 'you pull (him)', c) 'at all', as in (712),
where the scope of doro is again the whole clause n naa dl 'if you see
him'. Note that in all these usages no additional material is present in the
Koromfe sentences to support doro in the same way as English and that:Sail or at all.","[344, 345]"
