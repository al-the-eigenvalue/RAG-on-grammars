"23.2.2.1. Contrastive constituent negation
When a contrastive focus constituent is negated, the contrasting element is also
present in the sentence. It is in some way expressed in the conjoint clause with
the affirmative interpretation. In the negative clause negation is expressed in a
formally regular manner, while the verb in the conjoint clause takes the same
morphological form. Examples (1753) present the negation of the nominal
constituent, examples (1754) the negation of the predicative element of the
copular construction, and example (1755) the negation of the finite verb.

"9.5.1.3. Tag question function
The pronoun j'eu in the Nominative can express a tag question. The verb may
be either in the affirmative or in the negative form. The pronoun is typically
used sentence-finally, however in (626e) it precedes the verb.

"9.6.2.2.3. Negative function
Negative pronouns and adverbs are morphologically identical to the
non-specific Interrogative pronouns and adverbs formed with the particle -dA,
for example: ile-de 'nowhere', ali-de (or ali-ali-de) 'never', ni:-de 'nobody',
ni:-zi-de 'with nobody', j'e-uxi-de 'to nowhere' (LAT), j'e-we-de 'nothing'
(ACC). In other words, the polarity of the indefinite non-specific pronouns
depends on the general polarity of the sentence in which they occur. On the use
of the negative pronouns and adverbs, see 23.2.
Note also the negative adverb: emne-de 'not even once' (from emne 'once').
The numeral omo 'one' followed by the particle -do means 'not a single' under
the scope of negation.

23.2. Negation
Except for some special constructions, Udihe does not make the formal
difference between sentence negation and constituent negation. Examples of
these two negation types are presented below in 23.2.1 and 23.2.2, respectively.
In both cases, negation is expressed with the negative auxiliary verb e-/ei-,
which precedes the content verb and may take various morphological forms,
e.g. e-si-ti etete-du 'they were not working' <NEG-PAST-3PL work-PL>, e-s'e-li
etete 'without having worked' <NEG-PERF-CC.SS work>. For more
information on the conjugation of the negative verb and the form of the content
verb in negative sentences see 7.3 and 7.1.4. In certain copular constructions
negation is expressed by the impersonal copula anci 'no'.
Normally, the negative verb immediately precedes the content verb;
however, it is sometimes possible for it to be placed after the verbal stem, as
below.

Udihe does not exhibit negative concord. No overt negative elements appear

with the clitic particle -dA (9.6.2) function as negative pronouns.
Either the negative word itself (1749) or the noun phrase with the negative
modifier (1750) must be strictly preverbal. In subjectless existential
constructions the negative word is located before the predicative noun (1751).

Constituent negation does not differ in a formal respect from sentence negation.
When a constituent is negated but the contrasting alternative is not overtly
expressed, the clause is interpreted as sentence negation. Constituent negation
becomes apparent only in the situation of overt contrast, when the negated
constituent is formally opposed to another semantically similar element
(23.2.2.1). Only for some constituents is negation expressed by some
specialized sentence constructions (23.2.2.2).","[869, 870]"

When the periphrastic construction of alternating action (7.11.1) includes the

"23.2.1.2. Inchoative negative construction
Inchoative situations in the Past can be negated in two ways, depending on the
scope of negation. If the negation takes scope over the whole proposition ('did
not start doing something'), this is expressed formally in a regular manner:
with the negative verb in the Past and the content verb bearing the inchoative
suffix -li- (8.2.2.1). When the inchoative operator remains outside the scope of
negation ('started not doing something', that is, 'stopped doing something'),
Udihe uses a special construction. It indicates that the action no longer takes
place. The construction contains (in this order) the Present form of the negative
verb e-i, the bare stem of the content verb, and the verb ede- 'become' in the
Past tense with the corresponding agreement affix. Cf. (1705a) and (1705b):

Affirmative generalized relative clauses can be both finite (18.3.2.1) and
non-finite (19.5.2), but in the negative form only the non-finite construction is
allowed. Sentences with the generalized negative relative clause express the
non-existence of the class of objects characterized by the relative clause. The
superordinate clause of such sentences is a negative existential construction
with the existential negative copula anci. The relative clause is headed by an
indefinite non-specific pronoun (9.6.2) with the negative interpretation, or an
expletive word such as ba: 'place, nature'. The relative clause predicate
corresponds to the Destinative Participle (7.6.1.4). Like the regular relative
clause (Chapter 19), the generalized negative relative clause can be prenominai
or postnominal.
In prenominai clauses the Destinative Participle is not marked by a personal
inflection. In most cases it immediately precedes the head (indefinite pronoun)
as in (1743), but can be extraposed as well (1744). The Future passive
participle can occasionally function as the predicate of such a relative clause832Questions and negation(1745). The prenominai negative generalized relative clause normally has an
impersonal interpretation.

Copular constructions that express a temporal state and normally require a
personal non-habitual copula (17.1.1) are negated with the negative verb e- in
the corresponding personal form and the content verb 'be' in the form bie. This
negation type is, therefore, formally similar to the negation of non-copular
constructions (23.2.1.1). In (1718) the negative adjectival construction with
non-habitual copula is illustrated, in (1719) the construction with a quantifier,
in (1720) the adverbial construction, in (1721) the nominal copular
construction, and in (1722) the resultative construction. In adjectival
constructions the adjective may precede the negative verb as in (1718a), but it
may also be located between the negative verb and the verb bie, as in (1718b)
and (1718c).
(1718) a.",[860]
"214 Verbal morphology
7.3. Negative conjugation
The negative conjugation is periphrastic and can be formed in two alternative
ways. First, most verbal categories are negated with the negative auxiliary verb
e(i)- (7.1.4) in the corresponding temporal/aspectual/modal form followed by a
bare Present stem of the matrix verb (see also 23.2). The negative verb eappears in a morphological form that reflects the role of the predicate in the
sentence. Secondly, for other categories the negative construction has three
components: the negative verb in a certain form + the bare verbal stem + the
copula verb 'be' in a corresponding tense. These two types do not duplicate the
opposition synthetic/analytic.
The content verb appears as a bare stem or as a stem augmented by
derivational affixes. It may also take the suffixes -du- in the Plural or the bound
Plural word getu, although, like all other Plural markers, they are not
obligatory. The stems of the negative verb are presented in (7.1.4) and its
conjugation is exemplified in 7.3.
The examples below illustrate the different forms of the content verb in
negative sentences: class I verbs (346), class Π verbs for which the n-final stem
appears in the epenthesized form (347), and stems augmented by the Plural affix
-du (348).

"If the subordinate clause contains the existential copular construction, the
impersonal negative copula anci precedes the verb bi- in the corresponding

They are differentiated from them only by intonational patterns: the last word is

verb normally occupies the clause-final position. Examples (1675) show
ordinary yes-no questions, and examples (1676) illustrate negative yes-no
questions.

17.1.2.1. Forms
The Habitual copula has the form bie in the Present tense and (bie) bi-s'e in the

Present active participle of the Habitual copula 'be' is also bie. In other
tense/mood categories it does not have any special forms, that is, the difference
between the Habitual and the non-Habitual copula is neutralized. The Habitual
copula cannot be omitted from the sentence.
The Habitual copula is not negated with the regular negative verb like the
personal verb 'be' (17.1.1), but with the impersonal negative copula anci. The
two semantic types (existential and non-existential/habitual) are negated in
formally distinct ways, see 23.2.1.5. In non-negative sentences there is no
formal difference between the existential and non-existential Habitual copula
constructions.",[645]
"18.1.2.2.2. Negative possessive modifier
A negative possessive modifier is typically expressed in a coordinated structure
by means of the Partitive forms (on them see 4.3.2). In (1342) the second
clause p'a:-la anci 'there are no windows' refers to the element of the first
clause zugdi 'house'. Although no anaphoric means indicates this reference, it
is conceptually clear and can be rendered by a noun phrase within a single
clause as 'a house without windows.' In (1342b) in a similar situation the
personal marker refers to the element of the first clause: zawaijku-ni anci,
literally 'there is no its handle', where 'its' anaphorically refers to the element
of the first conjoined clause mulexi 'bucket'. In (1342c) there are two
coordinated negative possessive modifiers.

any sort of constituent, for example, a subject (845), a predicate (846), and a
postpositional phrase (847). It easily co-occurs with other elements that
normally bear the focus in the sentence, such as the negative auxiliary (848a), a

Dative noun phrase (17.2.3.1). The second argument (if present) may
correspond to the subordinate clause controlled by the Dative experiencer of
the superordinate clause (20.1.1.3). When the predicates listed in (1437) govern
the complement subordinate clause whose subject is not coreferential with the
Dative experiencer, the subordinate clause is finite. This case is treated in
18.3.1.5. Finally, the impersonal non-controlled infinitival subordinate clause
may function as the only argument (20.1.1.1).","[739, 740]"

23.2.2.2.3. Negation of the Proprietive
The Proprietive is negated with the copula anci and the Partitive form of the
possessed noun. This construction behaves like most regular modifiers, that is,
it can be either prenominal or postnominal (on postnominal extraposed
modifiers see 24.2.1.2.3). In the prenominal modifying construction the copula
is in the Nominative (1763). Such a negative modifier in the Nominative case
normally functions as a co-predicative element (1764).

12.1.2.2. Epistemic particles
Some evidential particles can be used in the epistemic function, which seems to
show that there is no strict border between these two categories. However,
some epistemics have a specialized meaning which deviate from the evidential
meaning as associated with evidential particles. Epistemic particles in a strict
sense do not indicate an indirect source of information, as evidentials do, but
rather the degree of the speaker's knowledge and belief about the event.
Although the lack of the speaker's commitment to the truth of the proposition
may be conditioned by the indirect source of information, this is not invariably
the case. The most important epistemic particles in Udihe are saina 'perhaps'
(12.1.2.2.2), bize 'must' (12.1.2.2.1), and j'aza 'of course' (12.1.2.2.3). The
particle bize is strictly sentence-final; the other two particles are located fairly
freely in the sentence.","[497, 498]"

Two verbs exhibit irregular stem formation: the copula bi- 'be' and the
negative auxiliary e(i)-. The Perfect and Past stem for these verbs are formed
with an element s that goes back to the old *-s- (the etymological source of the
pharyngeal Ihl found within the old Past stem marker, see 7.1.2). The stem
types of the irregular verbs are shown below:
(343)
Present stem

bibi-sibi-s'e-negative auxiliary
e-, eie-sie-s'e-For the negative verb the Present stem has two variations, ei- and e-. The stem
ei- is used in some personal forms of the Present tense, and in the Infinitive.
The element -/- here goes back to the regular Present tense marker also found
in the 3rd person Present tense verbal inflection (7.2) and Present active
participles (7.6.1.1.1). The stem e- is used for other forms that are based on the
Present stem, and also for some Present tense personal forms (namely the 2nd
Plural, the 3rd person, and the 1st Plural Exclusive).
Both auxiliary verbs also exhibit, in several other categories, stem patterns
that are irregular. The verb bi- has the irregular Present Habitual bie (7.3.2.3).
The form bie also functions as the stem that co-occurs with the negative
auxiliary. The negative verb exhibits the irregular stem ata- in the Permissive
and Subjunctive and the irregular Imperative (7.5.1). The irregular forms will
be cited below when discussing the formation of inflectional categories.","[244, 245]"

Both for finite and non-finite subordinate clauses there are two types of

"7.4.1.4. Future
Future forms are derived from the Present stem with the future suffix -ζΑηΑfollowed by IV type inflections. Class Π verbs have an optional epenthetic
vowel
after the stem in the Future. Examples:

<sleep-FUT-1 PL.IN>, dian-(a)-zaya-fi <say-0-FUT-lPL.IN> 'we (IN) will

"12.1.2.2.2. The particle saina 'perhaps'
The particle saina 'perhaps' is apparently etymologically related to the verbal
stem sa:- 'know' augmented with the archaic converbial suffix -na, see
7.5.2.3.3. It expresses a low degree of the commitment to the truth from the
speaker, and does not make any reference to the grounds for the assertion. This
particle is normally sentence-initial and co-occurs with the verb in the
Subjunctive (899a).
