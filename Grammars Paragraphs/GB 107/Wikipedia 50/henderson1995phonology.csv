It would seem that once an imperative is negated and its prenucleus specified, the rest of
the verb is treated as a 'basic' or 'simple' indicative proximal verb. Thus negative imperative
status is expressed only once in the verb phrase.","[64, 65]"

"CHAPTER 2
GRAMMARUnlike so many Papuan languages in Papua New Guinea, Yele does not have a switch
reference system. Verbs move in a bewildering array of modes and tenses, doubled by an all­
pervasive distinction in duration, and elaborated by the incorporation of deictics into the
verb. Analysis proves difficult, because many of these distinctions are expressed in
portmanteau morphemes, rather than by agglutination. Yele also shows the
monofocallpolyfocal distinction found in some New Guinea Highland languages.
The order of terms in the clause is SOV. Within the predicate, a modified norninative­
accusative system operates, but the items predicated in the clause follow ergative marking.
The ergative marker used with singular Agents, nge, is homophonous with the Instrument
marker, as in a number of Huon Peninsula languages.
2.1 PREDICAnONYele verbs move through a multidimensional array of:
indicative, imperative and habitual moods, doubled by
continuous and punctiliar aspect, and multiplied by
six tenses:
future, immediate future, present,
immediate past, near past and remote past.
The verbs also agree with the person and number of the subject and object. The
morphemes marking all these parameters are merged into portmanteau forms which defy
simple analysis, and contribute to the reputation Yele has of being impossible to learn,
whether by Papua New Guinean or by foreigner.
The morphemes appended to the verb root - prefixes and suffixes in many languages are in Yele separated from the verb root on phonological grounds. Thus a predicate consists
of a prenuclear component, verb root and postnuclear component, each written as a separate
word. Many verb roots vary in form to express the mood, aspect and tense by using
suppletive forms or reduplication. (Some irregular verbs have as many as five different
roots. See §2.1.4 for the details.)
The verbal prenucleus also expresses the mood, aspect and tense, along with the person
and number of the subject of the predication. (I am using the term 'aspect' in the 'catch-all'
sense, so 'aspect' in this chapter includes more than duration. It also includes the items
elaborated in §2.1.7, such as indefiniteness, commonality and repetition.) It is in the
prenucleus that a number of deictics can be incorporated. (See §2.l.S and §2.1.7).
With transitive verbs the postnucleus expresses the person and number of the object, but
also reflects the mood, aspect and tense, and often monitors the person and number of the
subject as well. (See §2.1.6).
1415
With intransitive verbs, the postnucleus expresses the duration, mood and tense of the
verb, and then the number of the subject. In imperatives, the postnucleus also monitors the
person of the subject. (See Tables 2. 1. 6.1 and 2. 1. 6. 2.)
The following examples illustrate the Ergative-Absolutive system operating in the clause.
The Ergative referent is marked with <ngb, while the Absolutive referent is unmarked.

inapplicableAt first sight the use of w-a-nyi or a-nyi in this text seems quite random, one form being
used for several clauses, and then the other form for several clauses. But then a subtle
difference emerges. Sentence 2 refers to any time in general when one would be making
copra, and begins the sequence of operations involved, all without the W-. The switch to51
using w- comes with sentence 3, which begins with U kuw6 dini ghi nge ' after that ' . The
situation is a little more definite now - the processing has begun and should not be
interrupted until it is completed. And so the clauses through to 5b all use w-a -nyi, but 5c uses
a-nyi, apparently because it refers to some generic prior time at which the firewood should
have been gathered. The definite situation marked with w- is resumed in 9a with further steps
in the copra-making process, until the end of the process is reached in 1 1 a, and the copra is
in the shed on the wharf waiting for shipping to market.
Sentence 1 4 begins an evaluative paragraph which presents the consequences of
processing copra well or badly, and this more general situation is indicated by the absence of
w-. So far so good. But why is w- used in sentence 1 7 ? Sentence 17 is essentially the same
condition and consequence as are found in 1 5, which does not have W-. It seems that here the
w- is used as a prominence marker, to highlight the responsibility a man has to process his
copra properly. And the w- is continued in sentence 18 to enforce the conclusion.
(3) Incorporating the deictic ala
The deictic ala ' this' (close to the speaker) has a parallel in a 'close ' , which occurs in the
predicate prenucleus to mark motion towards the speaker or proximity to the speaker.
Although the basic form is a, the morpheme takes a number of different forms, as presented
in the matrices A-7 and A-8 in the appendix. In some cases, a 'close' is added unchanged to
the 'unmarked' predicate prenucleus ( 1 04). (The added a is written as a separate word in the
practical orthography to avoid confusion with a long vowel within a morpheme. Where a
'close' is added, there is a pitch glide from the unmarked prenucleus down to the a, but this
does not occur with normal long vowels.)

For some combinations of TMA with Subject Person, yi- merges with the verbal

"2.3.3 QUOTATIONS
All quotations are direct. There is no indirect speech. Every utterance by the one person is
introduced by a quote formula which specifies when the words were spoken, and the person
and number of the speaker and of the hearer. Typically, each succeeding clause in the
quotation is introduced by a contracted quote formula that gives the person and number of the
speaker and of the person spoken to, and the tense.

This section deals with the order of items in clauses manifesting verbal predications.
§2. 1 .9 deals with non-verbal predications.
( 1 ) Presence of explicit subjects and objects
Since the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the Yele verb mark the subject and
object of the predication so fully, these referents are frequently not specified by nouns or
noun phrases. Typically, they are made explicit where they enter a discourse, or where the
referents change, and elsewhere are carried just by the markers in the verb. For example, text
(a) in §2.4 introduces the author in the verbal prenucleus of clause 1 , and thereafter his
identity is carried by the verbal markers. He introduces his brother Nkal by name in clause
6a, and the quote formulae in their conversation keep track of the speakers. Nkal refers to
fish with a noun in 6c. Third person objects are introduced with nouns in clause l Ob 'I didn't
see anyone' and 1 1 b 'I chewed some betel nut' . The author refers to his father with a kin58
term in 1 2c, and quotes h i s father' s use o f h i s own name in 1 3b. H i s father also mentions
fish with a noun, in 1 5b.
Where there is more than one third person referent on stage at a time in a discourse, the
subjects and objects are made explicit more often, to ensure that the hearer can keep track of
the referents of the clauses. (As is often the case, folk stories show less explicit reference to
the participants, because everyone knows who does what in the story, and it is not necessary
to be as explicit. Everyone knows, that is, except the linguist from another culture!). Text (d)
in §2.4 provides an example of a text with more than one third person referent on stage at a
time. It is by the same author as the fishing story referred to above. The topic of the text is a
savage dog, which is introduced and named in clause l a, then referred to with third person
singular verb parts in clause 1 b. The author disclaims responsibility in sentence 2 ,
introducing himself with a pronoun, and using the word 'dog' in sentence 3 . H e names the
culprit, his brother Nkal, with a noun, and uses the word 'dog' again in sentence 4. Nkal ' s
name is repeated i n sentence 5, but this time the other third person referent i s understood to
be the dog, without specific reference. The dog is mentioned again specifically in the next
sentence, number 6. It remains the topic of the rest of that paragraph, sentences 7 to 9, being
referred to only pronominally. Sentence 1 0 begins a narrative episode, in which Mepe and
his son Yidika are introduced by name. In this episode each sentence uses a noun to refer to
one of these actors, as the initiative moves from one third person referent to another in quick
succession. The result of the incident comes in sentence 1 7, but the dog is not mentioned
specifically - it is just the third person singular referent of the verb. The text ends with a
specific reference to a safe road for people to follow.
(2) Order of items in the clause
Apart from the subject and object of the clause, other items can be included at will when
their semantic content is to be made explicit, up to a limit of five items in any one clause,
including the predicate. The histogram in Table 2. 1 .8 . 1 shows the proportion of transitive
and intransitive clauses having each number of items. The histogram is based on a sample of
667 clauses all from texts or conversation.","[65, 66]"

(4) MEANS-PURPOSE
MEANS-PURPOSE is similar to MEANS-RESULT, but the event with the PURPOSE
relationship is intended, not necessarily realised. In Yele the PURPOSE clause is expressed
as an imperative.",[89]
"2.2.3 POSTPOSITIONAL PHRASES
Postpositional phrases are used to specify a locational concept in detail . Some such
phrases have extended meanings to express temporal setting or relative time. (See examples
(238) and (239) below .) Some postpositions require a dependent pronoun between the noun
and the postposition (233), while others do not (234).

"2. 1 .7 SECONDARY FACTORS
That brings to a close the discussion of the basic structures in the predicate. There are a
number of other factors which affect the predicate, all of which have been left unmanifested
in §§ 2. 1 .4, 2. 1 .5 and 2. 1 .6, to keep the complexity of the presentation within manageable
proportions. The following sections will deal with these factors in turn. Some forms of the
morphemes that manifest these factors can be seen easily enough as affixes, but others are
merged into the prenucleus, with confusing results. The factors are as follows, their basic
forms being listed along with them.

Where the Absolutive referent of a predication i s indefinite, i n Chafe ' s terms

"RESULT of (95c), (d), (h) and (i)
(AMPLIFICATION of (a))As listed in Table 2. 1 . 7 . 5 . 1 , ala and mu have cataphoric reference when used i n
discourse, and wu and yi have anaphoric reference. Discussion with the speaker o f this text,
Raymond, confirmed that ala used in clause (95a) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (c) and (d), and that its use in clause (g) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). He also said that mu in clause (h) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). Mu seems to be used here rather than ala, because it introduces another
following REASON, as mu is used as a deictic to refer to an 'other' entity. When asked
about yi in clause U), he said it referred to all the previous REASONs. Concerning wu in
(96a) and (96c), he said it referred to the earlier pair of REASONs in (95c) and (95d). There
is a parallel here between the real-world usage of wu to refer to an entity which is out of
sight. The earlier pair of preceding REASONs is 'out of sight' compared with the later pair
of preceding REASONs.
Five of these deictics have parallels in the predicate prenucleus with similar meanings. For
example, the basic form of the certainty prefix is Ja''.., and its typical use is to indicate that the
speaker was an eyewitness to an event. While kJ- and its variants are used with non-future
indicative events, future indicatives (that is events that have not been ' seen' yet) can be
marked with w- 'definiteness' in the same position in the predicate prenucleus.
( 1 ) Incorporating the deictic kJ
The incorporation of the other deictics is described in detail below, but first let us examine
kJ- and W-. The basic form kJ- merges into the predicate prenucleus. In the present tense of
continuous events, it takes the form k-, and is used only with third person subjects.

"762.2.4 WORD CLASS DERIVATION
Yele has several mechanisms for deriving a word of one class from a word of another
class.
Adverbs can be derived from verbs or adjectives by the addition of -mbiy:e.dpodo-- >d:umu

addition of -mM.pyoio-- >three.timespodo-- >four. timespyoio-mM

Predications can be linked by co-ordination or by subordination, depending on the
semantic relationship between them. The semantic relations are taken from Beekman et. al.","[83, 84, 85]"
"(5) Accompaniment
The viewpoint is different from English in that Yele uses the accompaniment slot to
specify more explicitly the subject of a clause, and the verb agrees in number and person
with the combined party, from the speaker' s point of view.",[76]
"IT. P- >C.SG.SB2. 1. 2 MOOD
I am using the term ' mood' to refer to a fuzzy parameter along which Yele makes three
structural distinctions, based on the type of speech act and the specificity of the action. These
distinctions are marked in the verbal prenucIeus and postnucIeus, and even affect the verb
root with some verbs. From the perspective of speech act, Yele makes only one major
distinction, namely that between informational speech and commands. Questions use the
same verb roots and exactly the same prenucIear and postnuclear components as do19
statements. Imperatives differ markedly in form from statements and questions. (Yes-no
questions differ from statements in intonation, and content questions contain a question
word. Otherwise they are the same as statements.) Thus Yele distinguishes morphologically
between informational speech and imperatival speech.
Within informational speech, Yele distinguishes between reference to specific events in
the past, present or future, as opposed to habitual events that people perform. The reference
to specific events is termed the indicative mood in this paper, while the reference to habitual
events is the habitual mood. Table 2. 1.2. 1 shows these distinctions diagrammatically.
TABLE 2. 1. 2. 1: PARAMETERS ALONG WHICH YELE MOODS ARE DISTINGUISHEDSpecific
InformationalIndicative moodSpecificity
HabitualHabitual moodSpeech act
CommandImperatival moodThe term 'imperative' is used for first person and third person forms as well as for second
person forms, as imperatival forms with all three persons of subject share two features in
common:
1 . All imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a tense distinction between
commands or suggestions to be carried out immediately and those to be deferred
until a later time. (See §2. 1. 3 below.)
2. All immediate imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a zero prenucleus. (See
Table 2. 1.5. 2 below.)
The morphological differences between the moods are difficult to characterise, because of
the portmanteau representation of a number of parameters at once. The following examples
illustrate the differences. The details are presented in §2. 1A and §2. 1.5 below.

2. 1 .7.2 COMMONALITY

'also' is merged with the predicate prenucleus. In example (76), the Agent and the event are
the same in both clauses, but the Patient differs.

"(2) Uniform verbs
As mentioned at the beginning of §2. 1 , many verbs express the mood, aspect and tense
by using suppletive forms, but there is a small set of verbs, referred to as ' uniform verbs' ,
which use the same root for all combinations of mood, aspect and tense. A n example is

The main factors affecting the predicate prenucleus are:
- duration
- mood
- tense
- person
- numbercontinuous or punctiliar (see §2. 1 . 1 above)
indicative, habitual or imperative (see §2. 1 .2)
six tenses in the indicative mood and two in each of habitual and
imperative moods (see §2. 1 . 3)
first, second or third person subject
singular, dual or plural subjectThe interactions of these parameters are marked by portmanteau morphemes related to the
pronouns, as presented in Tables 2. 1 .5.2 and 2. 1 .5 . 3 below, with following discussion.
That discussion defers consideration of a number of other factors which affect the
prenucleus, such as negation, contrafactual status, motion, included deictics and reference to
one of several objects. All these factors are such that they are only expressed in certain
situations and so to simplify the description of the predicate prenucleus, the forms where
these factors are not expressed will be used in this section. (These factors are described in
detail in §2. 1 .7.)
The Yele free pronouns are presented in Table 2. 1 .5 . 1 , for comparison with the prenuclei
in Tables 2. 1 . 5 .2 and 2. 1 .5.3.

Note that there are n o third person pronouns. The plural pronouns share nm (a
postalveolar nasal continuant with simultaneous bilabial closure).
( 1 ) The punctiliar predicate prenucleus
Table 2. 1 .5.2 presents the prenuclear forms used with punctiliar events. The forms used
in the indicative mood with the near past and remote past tenses are regarded as basic. These
differ from the free pronouns only in that the vowels are i following a palatalised consonant
and i elsewhere, and that the second person dual form is not nasalised. From these, the
future tense is formed by prefixing a - ' future ' . The immediate past indicative is formed from
the basic forms by adding a stop feature. The second person singular form chi is the
orthographic representation of Ityi/, which is manifested as an alveopalatal grooved affricate
[tJ] . Punctiliar habitual prenuclei can be regarded as being formed from the indicative
immediate past forms with simultaneous bilabial closure added.

Table 2. 1 .5 . 3 presents the prenuclear forms used with continuous events. The 'basic'
punctiliar forms (near past indicatives) are used with immediate past continuous events. Near
past indicative continuous forms are similar to these basic forms, except in the third person.
Future continuous forms can be derived from the near past continuous forms by the addition
of a - ' future ' , j ust as with punctiliar forms. Present tense continuous forms can also be
derived from the 'basic' forms by the addition of a- 'present continuous', except that the first
person dual and second person plural forms have e rather than i. Immediate future forms are
further removed from the basic forms. Proximal habitual prenuclei are the same as immediate36
future indicative forms. Distal habitual forms can be derived from the near past indicative
forms by the addition of -mo 'distal habitual' , except that the first person dual form i s
derived from the 'basic' counterpart rather than from the near past form, and the third person
singular distal habitual is copied from the third person dual form. Continuous imperative
prenuclei and remote past indicative prenuclei show less relationship to the 'basic' forms.

In predicate postnuclei, transitivity is the primary dichotomy. Table 2. 1 .6. 1 shows the
postnuclei used with intransitive events. Note that intransitive postnuclei reflect first the
duration of the event, then its mood and tense and finally the number of the subject. The
person of the subject is monitored only in the postnucleus in imperatives.","[41, 42, 43, 44]"

012.1. 4 THE PREDICATE NUCLEUS
The predicate nucleus consists of the verb root and sometimes an incorporated noun.
( 1 ) Noun incorporationNoun incorporation is a flexible and ongoing process in Yele, and is used to refer to an
action affecting a generic noun in the role of Patient or Goal. The noun incorporated must be
non- specific, and the resulting predicate is intransitive and continuous. As Mithun
(1984: 849) has pointed out, the noun cannot co-occur with deictics or numerals. Noun
incorporation in Yele matches her type 1.1 classification, composition by juxtaposition:
... a V and its direct object are simply juxtaposed to form an especially tight
bond. The V and N remain separate words phonologically; but as in all
compounding, the N loses its syntactic status as an argument of the sentence,
and the VN unit functions as an intransitive predicate.
Example (39a) is typical of noun incorporation, while (39b) shows how the noun cannot
be incorporated if specified in some way, in this instance by a possessive pronoun.
(39) a.",[34]
"The continuous root of a verb is also used as a nominal item, to name the event. When
used this way, the object affected by the event can be made explicit, but the Agent of the
action cannot be specified. Examples (11) and (12) below illustrate the verb 'hit', whose
punctiliar root is vy:a and whose continuous root is vyee. In example (12), vyee is used as a
nominal item. (Examples (11) and (12) can be seen in their wider context in text (a) in §2. 4,
where they are sentences 9 and l Oa respectively.)

inhabitants of Rossel Island in the Milne B ay Province of Papua New Guinea. It is non­
Austronesian, sharing only 6 per cent of cognates with the nearest Austronesian language,
Sudest. (See Henderson and Henderson 1 974.) No close relatives of Yele have been
identified.
This monograph describes the phonology and grammar of the language, highlighting the
portmanteau orthography and portmanteau interaction of tense, mood and aspect i n
predications. The grammatical description is b y prose statements, the analytical insights
being drawn mainly from Tagmemics and Functional Grammar (Dik 1 978).
A preliminary description of the Yele language was published in 1 975 ( Henderson 1 975).
I wish to express my gratitude t9 the people of the Jinjo area of Rossel Island, particularly
to Gregory Mepe, John Lamonga and Isidore Yidika, for their patience in teaching my wife
and me their language, and in explaining the significance of the features of Yele grammar. I
also wish to thank fellow members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics whose guidance
made this analysis possible, particularly Joy Lloyd, Anna Kila, Robert Litteral, Ger Reesink
and Carl Whitehead. I am also grateful to Professor Talmy Giv6n for his suggestions,
derived from his broad experience.vABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS[item] A

identical to that of the indicative in the 'proximal' tenses. (See §2.1.3.) This is true for all
person and number categories of subject and object.
2.1.3 TENSE
In the indicative mood, six tenses are distinguished for continuous events, but only four
for punctiliar events. Punctiliar verb roots cannot be manifested in the immediate future and
present tenses.
This section outlines the ways in which the tenses are distinguished. Sections 2. 1. 4 to
2.1. 6 give further details.",[28]
"2.2 TERM S PREDICATED
Discussion now turns to the terms within the clause that are related to the predicate. This
section deals with the system of cases marked in the clause, and with the structure of
phrases.
2.2. 1 CA SE RELATIONSHIPS
( 1 ) Ergative and Absolutive
The Ergative-Absolutive system operating within the clause has been introduced in §2. 1
(see examples 1 to 5). The modified Nominative-Accusative system operating within the
verb has been described in §2. 1 .5 and §2. 1 .6. This agreement is illustrated again briefly in
examples ( 1 46) and ( 1 50).
With transitive verb roots the verbal prenucleus agrees in person and number with the
Ergative item, the subject of the clause. (See the tables in §2. 1 .5 . ) The postnucleus agrees
primarily with the Absolutive item, the object of the clause, but it also monitors the subject to
some degree. (See the tables in §2. 1 .6.) Examples ( 1 46a) to ( 1 46e) illustrate this agreement.

The relationship can be made explicit with u l:ee diy:o 'on account of i n the REASON
clause as in text (c), sentence 2, but this seems an unusual construction.
Where events in the past are the REASON for a current and continuing RESULT, the
RESULT clause is marked with awede 'today ' . The following example is from text (d),
sentences 16 and 1 7.

§2.4, where the Topic is constant in both clauses, and the two differences are in the Time
and Comment positions.",[87]

(6) CONCESSION-CONTRAEXPECTATION
This relationship can be unmarked, the clauses being simply juxtaposed. See Sentence 1 0

tense, mood, aspect and Subject identity:
A continuous immediate future and continuous proximal habitual forms with non­
third person subject ( 1 1 1 ). (With third person forms the prenucleus is wune ( 1 1 2) . )
(This is analogous t o K in §2. 1 .7.4 above.)
B: continuous immediate past indicative and punctiliar indicative forms in which the
last syllable of the unmarked prenucleus contains a palatalised nasal, either a nasal
continuant ( 1 1 3 ) or nasal release ( 1 1 4).

Where the unmarked prenucleus is zero (see Tables 2. 1 .5.2 and 2. 1 .5.3) and the event is

"Non-verbal predication in past or future can not be distinguished from that in the present,
since there is no verb to carry tense marking. Example ( 1 37) is the first sentence of a folk

formally in any way. Note the similarity to example ( 1 34) above.
