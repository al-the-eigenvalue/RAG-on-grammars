Interrogative Sentences
There are two types of questions: one type applies a question word (wh-questions), while the other type does not (polar questions). The following types of
interrogative markers have been identified: special intonation, verbal inflection
and a special interrogative verb. The word order does not play a fundamental
role. If an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatory takes the
interrogative mood marker. The interrogative mood suffixes are different in different tenses. (For more on the interrogative mood see Section 5.5 in Chapter 5.)
Verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation.
2.2.1
Polar Question
Yes-no or polar questions do not require special word order. The word order
is usually the same as in the declarative sentence, but the order of elements380chapter 10is determined by the information structure. The verb can even move to the
first position of the clause or sentence, if it is emphasized, as in example (38b).
The subject is normally covert in this sentence type, but if it is emphasized it
appears in the sentence.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.123Verbless interrogative sentences have a high-pitch intonation pattern, the tone
peek being higher than that of an affirmative sentence. The following sentences
illustrate a fragment from a dialogue. There are two speakers, KH and KNT. Sentence (39a) contains a verb, but sentences (39c–d) are verbless.

existential particle ďaŋku (41a), or the negative existential verb ďaŋgujsʲa can
be used. It can be answered with the negative existential particle ďaŋku, however in most cases, the conjugated forms of the negative auxiliary are employed.

Wh-Question
In a wh-question, the question word replaces the questioned constituent. Any
sentence constituent can be the focus of a wh-question. It is possible to ask for
person, thing, place, time, manner etc. Question words are listed in Section 4.4
in Chapter 3. The following sentences illustrate questioned NPs, such as numerals (44a), adjectives (44b), and possessors in possessive NP (44c).

KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017A question word usually occupies the first position in a sentence; however, this
is not compulsory. Nganasan is a so-called in-situ language. It means that the
question word remains in the position, in which a non-question word (answer)
with the same grammatical function will be located. Thus, the syntactic function and the information status determines the position of the question word.
However, the question word always takes the position before the predicate (Wh
X V order). Sentences (45a–c) are examples of a sentence with a question word
in the sentence initial position. It must be noted that all question words in
sentences (45a–c) can also take the sentence internal position as sentences
(46a–c) portray.

KH-KNT_960810_Ngindjili_conv.043Multiple question constructions occur as well. These are built from two or more
simultaneously used wh-words. In this case, the speaker asks for two NPs. There
are some preferences according to ordering of question words: interrogatives
with reference to human entity preferably precedes interrogatives with nonhuman reference. Wh-word questioning location or manner usually follows
question words referring to human object or other non-human objects.

Other Questions Types
Similar to some Siberian languages such as Evenki, Tuvin, Nenets etc., there
is a special interrogative verb which cannot be used in a declarative sentence:
kumun-sa ‘say what; tell what’. The verb is historically formed from the interrogative stem ku- and the verb mun-sa ‘say’ and has a regular morphology. This verb
normally takes the interrogative marker as in kumuŋu, the interogtaive future
as in kumuntəŋu ~ kumunsuðə- or the interrogative iterative as in kumuŋkəə.
There are very few examples for dubitative and reportative interogative forms
as well. The verb can be negated with the negative auxiliary, has participial
forms and can take derivational suffixes such as passive and habituative. Question words are always missing from such sentences. The following sentences
show the usage of this verb.

ChNS_080214_Hibula.flkd.058Echo-questions are not typical for Nganasan texts, there are only very few
examples for this type. They are used, if the speaker has some doubts. Structurally, echo-questions are like polar questions. The following sentences illustrates this type. The second sentence is an example of an echo-question. As the
sentences show, the asked constituent is marked by an emphatic element.

Emphatic Use of Interrogative Sentences
The emphatic use of a question is typical for all Northern Samoyedic language
(Nenets, Enets and Nganasan). In this sentence type the interrogative form of
the negative auxiliary appears. This kind of sentence can express rhetorical
questions (52a), simple assertions, and assertions deduced from the context
(52b). The word order is the same as in the simple negated construction, thus
the auxiliary precedes the main verb.

Imperative Sentences
2.3.1
Positive Imperative
The imperative has its own marker in all personal forms (including the firstperson singular); but the most common form is the second person singular
form. The tense of the imperative sentences is usually the aorist (i.e. immediate future), it cannot be the past, but there are separate forms for future as
well. (For more about the personal markers see Section 5.2, Chapter 5.)
The verb of the predicate in the imperative sentence typically takes the sentence-final position, thus the word order in an imperative sentence is the same
as in a declarative sentence. The subject is not present in imperative sentences.

Prohibition
The negative imperative is expressed with the imperative form of the standard
negative auxiliary (ńi-sɨ). The negative auxiliary in a prohibitive sentence takes
the same imperative ending as the main verb in the positive imperative sentence. The imperative form of the auxiliary and the connegative of the main
verb together express prohibition. The negative auxiliary must precede the
main verb. In sum, the prohibitive structure uses the standard negative element
and the standard imperative strategy.

Negative Purposive Clause
Negative clauses of purpose are created by the negative supine form of the
main verb of the sub-clause, with the ending -mUŋkətə + (possessive suffix).
The nominal phrase typically appears at the beginning of the clause. If the
subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause are not the same, the
subject of the subordinate clause is either expressed by a possessive suffix on
the supine form, or by a nominal category in the genitive, or by both means, as
in sentences (32a–b).

Negative Questions and Their Affirmative Use
In negative questions, the negative auxiliary takes the appropriate inflections
and the main verb follows it in its connegative form. The question is mostly
dedicated to future and the negative auxiliary takes only the future marker as
in (34a). If the sentence is possessive or existential, the negative existential verb
ďaŋgujsʲa appears in its interrogative form, but it can use the negative existential particle ďaŋku as well. The sentence can express a real question or only provide emphasis. The negative element remains at the beginning of the sentence.

TNK, 2008The other type of negative question is not a real question; it is only used to
emphasize something. In such sentences, the negative auxiliary takes the interrogative marker, but keeps its sentence-final position together with the main
verb (SOAuxV structure). This sentence structure can never be interpreted as
a real question. Note that although the sentences below are syntactically negative, the meaning is positive.

Negative Lexical Words
There are some inherently negative lexical verbs and particles which are presented in Table 12.3.
The most frequent verb with a negative lexical meaning is ďerusa ‘not know’.
The positive conterpart of this verb is čenɨďi ‘know’. The following sentence pair
shows how the positive and negative verbs are used. The sentences below illustrate that the structure is not symmetric; negation is not simply expressed by
the insertion of a negative element into the sentence, but in the negative sentence the negative lexical element appears.","[441, 442, 443, 444]"

are only examples with iterative suffixes (-Kə). The conditional converb can

ChND_041213_Hibula_flkd.0161.3.2
Negative Possessive Clauses
Possessive sentences can be turned into negative sentences in several ways. The
existential possessive sentence type can be negated by the negative existential
verb ďaŋgujsʲa or the negative existential particle ďaŋku. Similar to existential
and locative sentences, the particle ďaŋku is applied to the aorist tense, and
it must agree in number with the subject. However, the negative verb is used
in all three tenses (see sentences 16a–b and 17a–b above), and it must agree in
person and number with the subject. This verb can take mood markers as well
(cf. 16c and 20b). This sentence type expresses that the possessed entity is not
in the possession of the possessor.

TNK 2008Apart from the negative existential verb, caritive suffixes can also express the
negation of a possessive structure. In this case, two structures can be differentiated. The NP with the caritive suffix can appear either with an affirmative form
or with the negative existential verb. The latter likely originates from the convergence of the nominative possessive presented above (Section 4.2 in Chapter 8) and the caritive construction. It is difficult to decide what kind of difference in meaning there is between the two constructions, some consultants
no longer distinguish between the two forms. The first structure is potentially
more tentative than the second. According to a native speaker consultant, the
first structure (NP with caritive + verb isʲa) suggests that the possessor does not
have any of the possessed entities at all (see 22a–b). The possessee, functioning
as the adverbial complement in the sentence, takes the caritive suffix. The copula takes the regular inflectional suffixes, and it agrees in person and number
with the possessor.

ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.007419negationAs demonstrated by the sentences above, this construction can be used for
both alienable and inalienable possession. In this sentence type the speaker
does not emphasize what the possession is, but rather the present state of the
possessor, namely that he or she does not have the given object at the given
time. As mentioned before, in this sentence type, the possession is the adverbial complement of the sentence.
There is another possibility to negate a possessive sentence. In this sentence
type, the possessed NP takes on the caritive ending; however, it is not accompanied by the BE verb, but by the negative existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the
negative particle (ďaŋku). Therefore, this is a case of what is called double negation, however, the meaning is not affirmative, but negative. The possessee never
takes on a possessive personal ending. The negative existential verb must agree
with the possessed NP. As shown in the following example sentences, this construction can be used for expressing both alienable and inalienable possession.
According to the consultants, with this sentence type, the speakers emphasize
that they do not own anything at all. In this construction the word order is (possessor) + negative existential + possessee in caritive.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.118Transitive possessive sentences must be negated by the negative auxiliary. This

only very few examples of this in the corpus. The standard negative auxiliary
is followed by the connegative form of the verb honsɨ ‘have’. Tense and mood
markers are carried by the negative auxiliary.

Negation of the Non-verbal Predicate
Negation in sentences with a non-verbal predicate depends on the tense. In
the aorist, the ńintuu(Ɂ) negative particle appears in the sentence immediately
before the predicate instead of the standard negative auxiliary. As the sentences
below demonstrate, in most cases the negative particle also takes verbal suffixes, not only the nominal constituents of the predicate (see sentence 25a). It
can occur that either the negative particle or the nominal part does not take the
verbal suffixes in this construction. This happens relatively often in more careless speech meaning, if the speaker speaks quickly. If there is a possessive suffix
on the nominal predicate, only the negative particle takes the verbal inflections, as in sentence (25c) below.

JA_0609_TwoTents_flkd.254If the sentence is not in the aorist, the negative auxiliary must be used, because
the negative particle cannot have both the tense and mood markers. The auxiliary takes the tense marker and the verbal suffix, but the connegative form of
the copula also appears in the sentence. Future tense sentences with a nominal
predicate are formed in a similar manner as in past tense sentences. Thus, it can
be stated that Nganasan applies the nominal strategy for non-verbal predicates
and that this is independent of the type of the predicate.

TKF_061025_SongOfATsar_flks.056In negative sentences word order is partly fixed, as the negative verb is always
followed by the sentence constituent being negated—in this case, the nominal
predicate. The negated copula must immediately follow the predicate in such
sentences, and these two form a constituent. In other cases, the negative auxiliary and the connegative form of the verb tend to appear next to each other
(cf. Section 1.1 above).","[435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"
"1Sentence NegationThe default way in which a sentence is negated is through the common negative
auxiliary ńisɨ, which is used in declarative as well as non-declarative sentences.
Section 1.1 deals with standard negation, while Section 1.2 describes negation
in non-declarative sentences. Negation of non-verbal, existential, locative, and
possessive sentences is discussed in sections 1.3 and 1.4.
1.1
Standard Negation
The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative
auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the connegative form of the main verb. In a negative phrase, the auxiliary always takes
mood and tense markers and inflectional suffixes and it agrees with the subject
in person and number, and, if the object is lexically covert, with the object in
number. The negated verb takes the connegative marker -ʔ, which is homonymous with the 2sg imperative marker. The connegative form of the verb isʲa
‘be’ is suppletive: ŋuəɁ. From a typological point of view, the standard negation
is asymmetric (cf. Misetamo 2005). This means that negative sentences differ
from affirmative ones not only in that there is a negative element present, but
also through structural differences. The paradigm of the negative auxiliary is as
follows.

attach to imperfective verbs (-NTU and -NTA1, cf. Section 2.2 in Chapter 5).
Note, however, that the aspect value of the construction depends on the value
of the main verb and not on the aspect value of the auxiliary. Thus, the construction ńindɨm tuɁ does not mean ‘I am not coming’, but ‘I did not come’408chapter 12because the aspect value of the main verb tujsʲa ‘come’ is [+perfective]. According to Gusev (2015: 107), in the Taimyr subdialect, the negative auxiliary can take
a perfective aorist marker (-Ɂǝ). However, there are only very few examples of
the auxiliary with a perfective aorist marker, thus this form is very rare. Sentences (1a–b) show a verb inflected in the common imperfective form, while
sentence (2) is an example of a verb form inflected in its perfective form.

KES_080726_Family_nar.031The negative auxiliary can take not only tense and mood markers, but derivational suffixes as well. The available data suggest that while aspectual and voice
makers tend to appear on the lexical verb, Aktionsart is marked on the negative auxiliary, as in sentences (5a–c) below. If a negative sentence is transposed
into passive voice, the main verb takes the passive suffix, as illustrated by sentences (6a–b). The distribution of grammatical categories is summarized in
Table 12.2.
The following sentences provide examples of the distribution. The most frequent derivational suffix on the negative auxiliary is the iterative suffix (-Kə),
but there are examples with habituative (-mUNHA), attenuative (-btA), imperfective (-NTə), and the resultative (-Ɂkə) suffix as well.

TLN_061021_MyGrandmother_nar.003The negative auxiliary cannot be negated, but it can be used with other auxiliaries such as ǝku-/ǝkɨ- ‘maybe’ and ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not, of course’, as in (8–9).
(For auxiliaries, see Section 3.3, Chapter 3.) If the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ- is used,
the main verb (in this case, the negative auxiliary) always precedes this auxiliary and takes the connegative marker. On the other hand, the negated lexical
verb must also take the connegative marker. The negated main verb follows
the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ-. This means that in the sentence two verbs appear in the
connegative form: the negative auxiliary, and the negated lexical verb.

The Negation of Non-declarative Sentences
As mentioned in Table 12.2, the mood markers appear on the negative auxiliary.
Synchronically, there is no separate prohibitive verb. However, it is possible thatnegation413historically the negative auxiliary (ńi-) and the prohibitive verb were different
(see Helimski 2004b). The prohibitive verb was documented by Castrén as having the form ńe-,1 but in the present state of the language, there is no reason to
differentiate two separate morphemes for these functions which are formally
the same (see 12 below). The negative auxiliary can freely take mood markers,
except for the abessive marker. The following pairs of sentences show imperative and prohibitive structures. The prohibitive forms have no special structure.
(12) a. tu-Ɂ
→ ńi-Ɂ
tu-Ɂ
come-imp.2sg neg.aux-imp.2sg come-cng
‘Come!’
‘Don’t come!’
b. mətu-ðə
→ ńi-tə
mətu-Ɂ
cut-imp.2sg.obc neg.aux-imp.2sg.obc cut-cng
‘Cut it!’
‘Don’t cut it!’
The sentence pair (12a–b) above shows verbs with subjective and objective conjugation suffixes. The prohibitive sentences show that the imperative 2sg and
the connegative suffix (cng) are formally the same (-Ɂ). Furthermore, it is also
demonstrated that there is no special prohibitive suffix or special prohibitive
negative element. The imperative suffix is attached to the negative auxiliary.
The difference in the form of the suffix in sentence (12b) is due to consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1 in Chapter 2) and is not connected to negation. The
lexical verb is in its connegative form and positioned after the negative auxiliary. The sentences above also illustrate that although the structure itself is
asymmetrical, the paradigm is symmetrical. Each imperative form has its corresponding prohibitive counterpart.
The negative auxiliary can take other mood markers as well. The following sentence pair illustrates this with forms bearing the irrealis marker. The
declarative-negative pair shows that the negative auxiliary takes the same
mood marker as the main verb in the positive sentence. The negative element
is the standard negative auxiliary.
(13) a. mɨŋ tətu-baaðəə-muɁ muraŋga-j,
mɨŋ ńi-sɨə-mɨɁ
we bring-irr-1pl
cloudberry-acc.pl we neg.aux-pst-1pl1 The 2sg forms of the subjective conjugation are recorded by him as ńeɁ, the form of the objective conjugation as ńetaɁ, the other form for negative auxiliary with ńi- (Castrén 1854: 493).
For a more detailed description of the historical background, see Helimski (2004a: 35–36).","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"

Negation of Existential, Possessive and Locative Clauses
There are two negative existential elements used for negation in existential,
locative and possessive clauses. The verb ďaŋgujsʲa ‘not to exist’, which has
a full paradigm, and a negative particle ďaŋku ‘no’ used as a predicate in the
sentence. The other Northern Samoyedic languages do not have this particlelike form, only the verb. The stem ďaŋku- has possible cognate verbs in Nenets
( jaŋko-), Enets (ďago-), Selkup (čaŋkɨ-) and a cognate word form in Kamas
(naga) as well as in Mator (ńäŋüh).2 For the negation of possessive sentences,
the negative auxiliary can also be used, if the possessive structure is expressed
by the have-verb honsɨ (see Section 1.3.2 below in this Chapter).
1.3.1
Negative Existential and Locative Clauses
As mentioned in Section 3, Chapter 9, the predicate of the existential or locative sentences is expressed either with the verb təisʲa or tənijsʲa. The existential
verb tǝij- cannot be negated by the negative auxiliary; in this case, the negative
existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the negative particle (ďaŋku) must be used. The
structure of sentences with the negative existential verb is the same as that of
declarative sentences. Sentences (14a–b) show the usage of the negative particle. It agrees only in number with the subject, while the negative existential
verb agrees with it in number and person. Sentence (14a) shows a predicate in2 Helimski (1997: 318/742) reconstructs the stem *jaŋko- for PS (by Janhunen (1977: 40) *jäŋkɜ).
In my opinion, this PS form has been retained as a particle; the negative existential verb is a
more recent grammaticalized form consisting of the negative existential predicate ďaŋku and
the BE verb isʲa (ij-). Otherwise, the infinitive form of the verb according to morphophonological rules would be ďaŋkuďa. Castrén (1854: 490–491) still states that this element cannot
carry any suffixes but is followed by the BE verb.","[432, 433]"

Negative Polarity Items
There are special NPI forms, which are derived from the interrogatives, similar to indefinites. The interrogative pronominal stem is followed by the -kəlʲičə
emphatic morpheme, as maa-gəlʲičə ‘whatever’, sɨlɨ-gəlʲičə ‘whoever’ etc. This
emphatic morpheme is identical to the emphatic suffix of personal pronouns
(cf. Section 4.1.6 above). The morpheme -kǝlʲičǝ does not carry a negative meaning in itself, which is indicated by the fact that it can occur in affirmative sentences as well—although in such cases it is not connected to the question word
as sentence (92) shows. The negative polarity items need a verbal licensor to
function as negative indefinites (see 93b below).

be classified according to their semantic characteristics or their morphological
make-up. Adverbs can be semantically divided into the following subclasses:
degree, locative, directionality and time adverbs. They can take inflectional suffixes: the spatial adverbs have a locative paradigm. This section first describes
the morphological structure of adverbs then classifies them according to their
semantic properties.
5.1
Morphological Properties
Monomorphemic adverbs are very rare, e.g. kuɁ ‘very’, talu ‘yesterday, tomorrow’. Adverbs only have limited inflection: they have only got a locative paradigm. They are of two types, depending on the ending attached to the stem.
The first group takes ancient inflectional suffixes, while the second group takes
the synchronically used inflectional morphemes.
Adverbs—that were originally relator nouns, pronouns (əm-, tə-), or most
often, postpositions—take the ancient inflectional morphemes instead of the
generally used endings. These adverbs have been lexicalized. Lative case does
not have an overt inflectional morpheme on the surface level, but the empty
consonant, which through the historically motivated deletion process disappears, triggers gradation. Ancient inflectional suffixes primarily appear on adverbs of place and time. In the case of adverbs of place, four directions can be
encoded (Lative, Locative, Elative, Prolative), while adverbs of time most often
take the Locative or Elative ending, occasionally the Lative suffix is used. It
might be the case that adverbs of time are practically adverbs of place used in a
time adverbial function. The ancient inflectional suffixes are given in Table 3.6.
Adverbs can take present day modern case suffixes as well; in most cases,
the common elative suffix is used, e.g. əm-kətə ‘from here’, ńer-kətə ‘from the
middle’. Some case suffixes have a function resembling that of derivational144chapter 3suffixes. In this description, they are marked as adverbial derivational suffixes.
They are shown below:
a) The plural genitive ending can form adverbs of manner and time:
ńaagəə ‘good’
→ ńaagəi-Ɂ ‘well’
ŋukəgəə ‘many’ → ŋukəgəi-Ɂ ‘often’
b) The lative and plural lative form of the word hüə ‘year, age’ forms the time
adverb hüətə ~ hüətiɁ ‘always, all the time’, but this word-formation is not
productive.
c) Similar to plural genitive, the singular prolative marker forms adverbs of
manner.
ərəkərə ‘beautiful’ → ərəkərə-mənu ‘beautifully’
nəŋhə ‘wrong’
→ nəŋhə-mənu ~ nəŋhə-mənɨ ‘badly’
d) Repetitive distributive adverbs of time can be formed by the prolative plural marker. In this case, the base can be only a noun with reference e.g. to
seasons:
sʲirü ‘winter’ → sʲira-Ɂmənu ‘every winter, in wintertime’
təŋə ‘summer’ → təŋu-Ɂmənu ‘every summer, in summertime’
The above discussed ways of derivation are, in almost all cases, in complementary distribution, which means that the adverbial form of each word can only
be derived in one way. Two different forms are seldom used for the same function. Such forms are, however, ńaagǝiɁ and ńaagǝǝmǝnu ~ ńaagǝǝmǝnɨ ‘well’.
The occurance of the latter forms is in only 5% of cases. Compare the following sentence pair.
(94) a. təbtə ńi-sɨə-mə
ńaagəi-Ɂ ďindi-Ɂ.

earlier-emph live-pst-1pl good-adv
‘We used to live well in the past.’
JSM_090809_Life_nar.001Only some derivational suffixes take part in the derivation of adverbs. In some
cases, the adverbs are lexicalized and the derivational suffix is not systematically used to form adverbs. The sociative derivational suffix -səbtə ‘together
with’ (cf. Section 6.4 in Chapter 16) forms adverbs of manner: ŋubu-səbtə ‘with
the finger’, ńuə-səbtə ‘with the child’, taa-səbtə ‘with the reindeer’, kabi͡a-səbtə
‘with the shamanic clothes’. These adverbs are unchangeable.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163]"

This grammar examines the Nganasan language, an endangered Samoyedic
language, which belongs to the Uralic language family. This description is based
on the materials from the Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC) which
was created as part of the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan
project (supported by the German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1, for information about the corpus see details in Section 4, Chapter 1). Most of the examples
are taken from this corpus and are passages from spontaneously produced
texts. Another portion of examples are elicited materials, produced either
spontaneously or in response to questions. Data which rely on existing grammatical descriptions (as e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.) are
also occasionally used.
Examples are provided in phonological transcription form with morphemeby-morpheme glossing. Morphemes are separated with hyphens, multi-word
categories in glosses such as ‘elderly sister’ are linked by a dot as in ‘elderly.sister’. Grammatical categories which are not expressed by a separate morpheme
are linked by a dot as in run.3sg. Nominative singular is never marked. Words
which are necessary in the English translation, but are absent in the original
text are bracketed, the only exception are the personal pronouns. Because Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, personal pronouns only appear in
sentences seldom. The Nganasan personal pronouns are not marked for gender. For the sake of economy, they are translated as ‘s/he’.
This grammar is intended to be a comprehensive description of modern
Nganasan, which follows the traditional structure. It consists of 16 chapters
and two glossed texts. The introduction describes the sociolinguistic situation,
a brief history, typological features and gives information about the corpus
used in this grammar (Chapter 1). The phonetic features and phonological processes are presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also deals with the phonological
and morphophonological alternations found in the data. Chapter 3 gives an
overview of the classification of the different kinds of words (word classes).
Morphological features are discussed in Chapter 4 (Nominal inflection) and
Chapter 5 (Verbal inflection). Chapter 6 and Chapters 8–13 describe the syntactical and some semantic properties such as noun phrases, types of predicates,
simple and complex sentences, verbal valence and evidentiality. Pragmatic
organization is shown in Chapter 14, while Chapters 7 and 16 describe the word
formation processes. In Chapter 15 some basic informations are given about the
core vocabulary. The reason for this is that it has traditionally been one of the
most neglected area in the study of Samoyedic languages. This description isxprefaceorganized in thematic sections. Chapter 17 contains two example texts with
interlineal glosses. One text is a short folklore text, the other text is a biographical narrative.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"chapter 12Negation
This chapter deals with the ways in which negation can be formed. Negation is
a well-studied topic, thus in this chapter only the most important features are
summarized. (For more details on negation, see Wagner-Nagy 2011 and Gusev
2015.) Nganasan, like many Uralic languages, has negative auxiliaries, but it uses
a negative particle as well. The elements of negation are mostly in complementary distribution, i.e. in a certain sentence type, only one kind of negative element can be used. Only the negative existential particle ďaŋku and the negative
existential verb ďaŋgujsʲa are interchangeable under certain circumstances.
Table 12.1 below summarizes the forms and usage of the negation elements.
This chapter is structured as follow: In Section 1, sentence negation is described. The constituent negation is presented in Section 2. Other negative
construction such as negation of purposive sentences or negative lexical verbs
etc. are described in Section 3.","[423, 424]"
"Acknowledgments
Work on this book took its first concrete form in 2006 during my work with
Zuszsa Várnai, Sándor Szeverényi, Nóra Wenszky and Attila Novák on the Nganasan morphological analyzer within the Project “Morphological analyzer of
Nganasan” supported by Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary, project
number K60807). Thanks to my fabulous colleagues, I learned very much not
only about the Nganasan phonology and grammar, but about grammar writing in general. My ideas came to a final formulation during my works with
Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev and Sándor Szeverényi on a Nganasan corpus.
This project was supported by the Deutsche Forschungesgemeinschaft (DFG,
Germany, project number WA 3153/2–1).
I would like to thank here all persons who helped me to complete my study
on Nganasan. First, I wish to thank Tibor Mikola and Eugen Helimski, who first
introduced me to the Nganasan language and culture and who made my first
fieldwork trips to the Taimyr Peninsula possible. My fieldwork opportunities
were supported by a grant from Soros Foundation awarded to me in 1996, the
Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary) awarded to me in 2007, a project
grant from Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF, Austria) awarded to Johanna Laakso in 2008, and a project grant from the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Germany).
Very special thanks go to my colleagues, Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev,
Oksana Dobzhanskaya, and Alexandre Arkhipov, who helped me to organize
the expeditions and who helped me during my fieldworks.
I also thank my colleagues Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev, Jean-Luc Lambert,
Zsuzsa Várnai, Oksana Dobzhanskaya and Sándor Szeverényi for sharing with
me their field recordings and permitting me to continue researching.
My gratitude also goes to Anna Fenyvesi, Gerrit Jawinsky, Hannah Wegener
and Alexander David Curtis for reading and correcting the manuscript of this
book. I would like to thank Marianne Bakró-Nagy, Valentin Gusev, Gerson
Klumpp and Sándor Szeverényi, who commented on the previous versions of
this grammar. Their remarks were helpful for my work. I would also like to thank
Brill: my work with the staff of the publisher has been very pleasant at all stages
of the production of this book.
Of course, my deepest gratitude goes to my consultants in Usť-Avam, Volochanka and Dudinka. Special thanks are due to my parents, to my daughter and
to my husband for their understanding, patience and emotional support.

This chapter summarizes basic facts about the Nganasan and provides an
overview of the history of the Nganasan people (Section 1). Basic information
about genealogical affiliation, dialects, sociolinguistic status of the language
and the typological profile are described in Section 2. Section 2.5 presents the
Cyrillic orthography as well as the writing system used in this volume. Section
3 provides an overview of previous works on Nganasan and describes the language data used in this grammar.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

JSM_090809_Life_nar.3943Other Negative ConstructionsThis section deals with other possibilities for clause negation. One of these is
a special suffix, the abessive. Additionally, the supine also has a negative form,
and some verbs can also be found which express an inherently negative meaning.
3.1
Abessive
Clause negation can be expressed with a verb through the abessive marker.
While negation with the standard negative auxiliary verb simply negates, the
abessive verb conveys some extra meaning which cannot be described by simple means of logic. The word büümǝtumaɁaɁ does not convey the same meaning as ńindɨɁ büɁ ‘they haven’t gone’. The form büümǝtumaɁaɁ means that ‘they
haven’t left yet’. The structure of the above sentences does not differ from the
structure of declarative sentences. Although these constructions do not belong
within the scope of negation from a syntactic perspective, this structure is a
case of sentence negation semantically speaking.
The abessive can be used predicatively (abessive mood, cf. Section 5.10 in
Chapter 5) or attributively (abessive participle, cf. Section 6.2.4 in Chapter 5).
And what is more, the abessive participle can be derived into an adverb as
in sentence (31). Such verbs refer to actions that were expected to occur, but
have not occurred (‘not-yet’). All verbs except for negative auxiliaries can take
the abessive marker. Sentence (29) shows the verb usage, in sentence (30) the
abessive participle appears which takes the attributive position, while in sentence (31), the adverbial form occurs.","[440, 441]"

Tereshchenko 1979: 262There is a negative discourse particle (sɨlʲiɁi͡a ~ sɨlʲiɁi͡aɁ ~ sɨlʲiɁi͡aðǝ) which
means ‘I do not know’. It can appear as an answer to a question or it is a reaction
to an idea or event as in sentences (40a–b). The only referent of this particle can
be the actual speaker, it is not possible to refer to another person. It tends to take
the sentence or clause initial positio, but some discource particle precedes it.

MVL_080225_Ojoloko_flkd.006The verb toisʲa ‘be not needed’ is used infrequently. It always appears in the
imperative form, mostly in the third person. In this case, it has an impersonal

very rare, while (41b) is an example of third person.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.465There are another two verbs with inherent negative meanings: ŋimsʲasʲi ‘not
notice’ and məči- ‘not get, not reach’. Both verbs appear seldom. The usage of
the verb ŋimsʲasʲi is illustrated in the sentence pair (42a–b). In sentence (42a)
the sensory verb ‘see’ is negated with the regular negative auxiliary, while in the
inquiry sentence (42b), only the negative lexical verb occurs.

In complex sentences, two or maybe more predicative relations are expressed,
which in European languages usually relate to a syntactic connecting element (for example with a conjunction or relative pronoun etc.). Like in other
Samoyedic and Siberian languages, true complex sentences are not characteristic for Nganasan, they are quite rare. Meanings expressed by a subordinate
clause in English for example, are mainly expressed by non-finite verb forms
(e.g. participles or converb construction).
This chapter provides an overview of the common features of the traditional
clause combining strategies such as coordination and subordination. In coordinated clauses, the clauses are linked together which have the same function and
are syntactically not dependent one on another. In contrast with coordinated
clauses, subordinated clauses depend on the main (matrix) clause and they
function as a constituent. There are several types of subordinate clauses: complement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses. Section 1 deals with
coordination, complementation is presented in Section 2, Section 3 describes
the adverbial clauses, while Section 4 gives an overview of the relativization
strategies.","[445, 446, 447, 448]"

MVL_080226_TwoHorses_flks.590The negative verb ďerusa can take subjective and objective inflections, but not
reflexive ones. Derivational suffixes are rarely attached to ďerusa, but tense
markers can appear on this verb. In sentence (38) below, ďerusa takes a tense
marker, while in sentence (37) the iterative suffix is attached to it.

KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017Semantically negative verbs such as ďerusa ‘not know’ can also be negated with
the negative auxiliary. In this case, the construction has a positive emphasized
meaning ‘it knows’ as in sentence (39) below. The negative auxiliary always
takes the interrogative marker. Negation in such sentences does not refer to
the presupposition and the answer must be positive.","[444, 445]"
"2Constituent NegationConstituents are negated by the negative particle ńintuu, which appears immediately before the negated constituent. The same particle is used to negate
non-verbal predicates (cf. Section 1.4 above). If tense or mood is expressed in
the clause, a copula is not needed, because only the negated item stays in the
scope of the negation. Tense markers are carried by the main verb, but the latter
is not in the scope of the negation.",[440]
"99word classes3.2
Verbal Word-Formation
The verbal derivational morphology is quite rich. It includes aspectual and
valence-changing derivation, as well as interclass derivation. The valencechanging processes are discussed in Chapter 7, while some interclass derivational suffixes are described in Section 6.3.1, compound-verb in Section 1 in
Chapter 16.
One of the most frequently used and most productive derivational suffixes
is the imperfective suffix -ntə (See Section 6.3.2.3 in Chapter 16). It appears on
perfective verbs and the derived verb is always imperfective, e.g. hu͡ansa ‘put
down’: hu͡antəsa ‘put down [impfv]’. Other imperfectivizing suffixes express
iterative, durative, habituative or frequentative meaning.
There are perfectivizing suffixes as well; they normally express inchoativeresultative meaning, as the inchoative -lə, e.g. hujsʲi ‘call’: hu-lʲə-sʲi ‘begin to
call’. There are many denominal verbs. The translative (change-of-state) verb
formed by the suffix -m ‘become X’, e.g. bahi ‘wild reindeer’: babi-m-sʲa ‘become
a wild reindeer; become wild’ is among the more frequent denominal type of
verbs.
3.3
Auxiliaries
The number of auxiliaries is quite low. One of them (ńisɨ) carries a negative
meaning. The true predicate of a negative phrase (NegP) is formed from a
negative auxiliary with a personal suffix. The main verb is in its connegative
form, which always follows the auxiliary. For information on negation see the
detailed account given in Chapter 12. The other part of auxiliaries does not have
a negative meaning, but they are followed or preceded by the main verb in connegative form (cng). The only exception is the verb konɨďi ‘go’ as an auxiliary.
The attested auxiliaries and the auxiliary constructions are listed below.","[117, 118]"

kasaďa ‘almost, nearly do smth.’
The auxiliary kasaďa with the meaning ‘almost, nearly’ was described in traditional descriptions (Tereshchenko 1979: 261, Wagner-Nagy 2002: 151) as a negative auxiliary, but actually it carries no negative meaning (see also Gusev 2015:
128). The auxiliary is followed by the connegative form of the main verb. It
can be conjugated in all conjugation types. Sentence (7b) shows the verb in
reflexive conjugation, sentence (7a) in the subjective, and (7c) in the objective
conjugation.

above shows, the lexical verb normally takes the passive marker. However, the
auxiliary can also take, for example, the passive suffix, which can even be followed by inflectional suffixes, and the lexical verb can also take a derivational
suffix. This is shown by sentence (9).

3.3.2
ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly, be unable’
The auxiliary ləðiʔsʲ can be classified as a type of negative auxiliary and translated as ‘cannot, be unable’, which is followed by the connegative form of the
main verb. The auxiliary is imperfective and occurs only with imperfective
verbs. It can take derivational suffixes (10b), tense markers (10c), and can be
inflected in the subjective (10a), reflexive (10d), and objective (10e) conjugation. Which conjugation is used depends on what conjugation the verb would
be in, if not in a construction involving an auxiliary. The use of conjugations
is discussed in Section 1, Chapter 9. The following examples demonstrate the
usage of the auxiliary. The opposite of this verb is the verb tukəďa ‘be able’, an
example is given in (11c) below.

əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’
The auxiliary əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’ behaves like the imperfective verbs,
but its paradigm is defective. It does not have an infinitive form, and does not
take tense or mood markers. Unlike kasaďa ‘almost, nearly’ and ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly,
be unable’, this auxiliary takes the sentence final position, thus the main verb in
the connegative form precedes it. It is peculiar in that it assimilates to the lexical verb in terms of suffix alternation. (For information about suffix alternation
see Section 7.2 in Chapter 2.) It can be safely assumed that it evolved from the
particle əku (see Section 12.2 below). Thus, in principle, a process of lexicalization and not of grammaticalization can be observed. The auxiliary can be
conjugated by all conjugation types. The usage of the auxiliary is illustrated by
the sentences below.

ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not; of course’
The auxiliary ŋuǝlɨ- means something like ‘of course, how can you think I/you/
he will not; how could I/you/he not’. The majority of descriptions referred to
ŋuəlɨ- as a monomorphemic verbal stem (Tereshchenko 1979: 261; Katzschmann 1993–1994: 58), but in my opinion, the stem of the word is ŋuə-, which
is followed by the dubitative suffix -lɨ- and the personal marker (for dubitative
see Chapter 5, Section 5.11). It is possible that the stem is related to the particle
ŋuəlɨ ‘of course, naturally’ particle, but the direction of the evolution process
cannot be determined. The meaning of the stem ŋuə- is not absolutely clear, but
the S2 stem of the BE verb (i-sʲa) is also ŋuə-. Therefore, it is possible that the
dubitative form of the BE verb was grammaticalized as an auxiliary. However,
this supposition needs to be tested further.
This auxiliary is always followed by the connegative form of a lexical verb,
which suggests that ŋuəlɨ- is an auxiliary whose infinitive form does not appear among the data. This means, this is an auxiliary with a defective paradigm.
Although, there is very little data available with the ŋuəlɨ- auxiliary, but it is understood that, ŋuǝlɨ- can be conjugated in all conjugation types, though it never
combines with the aorist marker (-NTA or -Ɂə, see Section 4.1 in Chapter 5) or
other tense markers. This auxiliary cannot take derivational suffixes, but emphatic suffixes do attach to it, as sentence (12a) illustrates. There are however
only very few examples for this available. There are examples for the auxiliary
conjugated in the subjective (12a–b), objective (12d) and reflexive (12c).

konɨďi ‘become’
The verb konɨďi with the meaning ‘go away’ is also used as an auxiliary in
resultative and translative clauses with the meaning ‘to become something,
to change to’. It appears with nouns as well as with adjectives and numerals.
The auxiliary is obligatorily preceded by a nominal part of the construction
and the infinitive form of the BE verb isʲa. In interrogative sentences, the auxiliary takes the interrogative marker as in (13b). For detailed description on the
essive-translative construction see Szeverényi & Wagner-Nagy 2017a.

KVB_97_EvilSpirit.0274Pronominal ItemsNganasan has personal, interrogative, demonstrative pronouns and intensifiers. Human beings are referred by personal pronouns, while animals, plants
and objects by demonstratives. There are no dedicated possessive pronouns;
this is expressed using personal pronouns (see Section 4.1.7). Indefinites are
derived from question words using the -küə/-güə, -čə clitic-like morphemes (see
Section 7.3 and Chapter 16). There are no special negative pronouns, the question words with the emphatic clitic -kəlʲičə/ -gəlʲičə may be treated as negative
polarity items (see Section 4.6 below). Neither relative, nor reflexive pronouns
are present. The reflexive or reciprocal meaning is covered by the word hütəðə
‘body’, by the word ńa ‘companion, friend’ with the possessive suffix, and by
the word sɨɁ ‘image of living things’ marked for the relevant personal possessive suffix (15). If in this kind of sentences the intensifier ŋonə- appears, it has
an emphatic intensified meaning. Another possibility for expressing a reflexive
situation is the usage of reflexive conjugation; cf. Section 3.3 in Chapter 5.

Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns can only refer to humans, animals and plants, while objects
are referred to by demonstrative pronouns, but occasionally demonstratives
refer to humans as in sentence (17c). There is no gender distinction.
All three numbers (sg, du, pl) and each person has a corresponding personal pronouns, making nine personal pronouns altogether. Special honorific
forms (such as Hungarian ön, or the use of plural forms in this function, as
in German Sie (3pl) or Russian Vy (2pl)) do not exist, however there are few
examples for the use of 2pl personal pronoun in this function. This is obviously
due to Russian influence.
The behaviour of personal pronouns is the most noteworthy aspect of pronouns. Although they cannot be inflected in the way other nominal categories
can, several emphatic clitic-like suffixes can be attached (cf. Section 4.1.4).
These emphatic markers may attach to other pronouns as well.
The 3sg, 3du and 3pl forms of personal pronouns are derived from the noun
sɨʔ ‘portrayal, picture, image (of living things)’ followed by corresponding possessive suffixes. The forms are shown below:
(16) Personal pronouns
sgdupl1st person mənə ‘I’
mii ‘the two of us’
mɨŋ ‘we’
2nd person tənə ‘you’
tii ‘the two of you’
tɨŋ ‘you’
3rd person sɨtɨ ‘she, he’ sɨti ‘the two of them’ sɨtɨŋ ‘they’Personal pronouns most often function as the subject of a sentence. If the
pronoun is the subject,—Nganasan being a consistent null-subject language—
it is only optional; the verb inflection replaces the pronouns. Overt personal
pronouns are only used in contexts where they have special discourse significance, such as emphasis. Sentence (17a) is an example with an overt pronoun
in the subject position, while in sentence (17b) only the verbal ending refers
to the number and person of the subject. (More about this topic see in Chapter 9). To the 3rd person humane referent in subject position can refer to theword classes107anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’. The demonstrative always take the 2nd
person possessive suffix. Some speaker use instead the anaphoric demonstrative the distant deictic pronoun takəə ‘that’. The exact distribution between
these forms regard further investigation.

ChND, 2008Personal pronouns can also serve as direct objects, but unlike to other Samoyedic languages, they not have inflected forms. Presently, the accusative and the
genitive forms are identical to the nominative form. Older speakers still tend to
use the former suffixes, especially in the accusative case (-m), however there are
only very few examples for this phenomenon. In the speech of younger speaker
the inflected forms never appear. Sentence (18a) illustrates a personal pronoun
in object position with the accusative suffix, while sentences (18b–c) depict a
personal pronoun without the case marker.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.070Local menaings of personal pronoun are expressed by special postpositional
forms (cf. Section 4.1.1 below).
4.1.1
Oblique Cases of Personal Pronouns
Local meaning of personal pronouns are replaced by postpositional structures.
This feature is not unique among Uralic languages; for example Nenets, Enets
and Hungarian oblique forms are also of postpositional origin.
In oblique cases of personal pronouns, the inflected postposition na ‘to;
near’ is used, which is marked for case and takes a possessive suffix from the
oblique series. This postposition is optionally accompanied by the personal
pronoun. Postpositions do not take the common case suffixes described in Section 3, in Chapter 4, but rather a more ancient set of suffixes. Elative forms are
an exception, since they are inflected with the suffix which is still being used
today. The postpositional/adverb series of case suffixes is discussed below, in109word classesSection 5. In contrast to the locative, elative and prolative, the lative is morphologically unmarked. The reason for this is that the ancient lative suffix gets
deleted, according to morphophonological rules, before possessive suffixes that
begin with a consonant. (For a discussion of phonological rules, see Section 7
in Chapter 2.) The personal pronouns can appear before postpositional forms,
but this is only optional. The following chart shows the oblique forms.

obligatory. (For comitative case see Section 3 in Chapter 4.)

TKF_031117_ThreeBrothers_flk.368The dative or lative meaning is also expressed by a separate form. This is formed
from the dative-allative postposition ďa ‘to’, which is followed by the destinative suffix -Tə (-tə, -ðə), and a possessive suffix attaching to oblique cases.
Therefore, the paradigm is as follows:(25)sgdupl1person ďa-tə-nə ďa-tə-ni ďa-tə-nuɁ

Postpositional Form of Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns do not have forms marked for postpositions. Instead, such
forms are used where the postposition itself takes the appropriate possessive
suffix (the one attaching to oblique cases). These inflected postpositions can
be used on their own, fulfilling the function of a personal pronoun, but the
relevant personal pronoun can appear before them. The chart below shows
how these forms are derived with the stem ŋilʲənu ‘under’. Other postpositions
behave in a similar manner. For information about postpositions, see Section
10 below.

an NP. There is a noun before it, while in sentence (28b) the pronoun is not
overt, with the person being indicated only by the possessive personal suffix
affixed to the postposition.

Comparative Forms of Personal Pronouns
If in an equality sentence the compared entity is referred to by a pronoun, it is
expressed by a derived form of the postposition na ‘to, towards’ or with mantə
‘like, similar’. If the construction is formed with the postposition na, the similativesuffix (-RəKU) is followed by the nominative form of the possessive suffix
that refers to the appropriate person. It is, however, the oblique forms of possessive personal suffixes that connect to the postposition mantə. Both forms
are listed in Table 3.1.
In an equative sentence, the forms with the postposition na and -RəKU can
appear without the personal pronoun, while the postposition mantǝ is always
preceded by the pronoun.

TKF_031118_Ostyak_flk.507If in a comparative construction, the standard of comparasion is pronominal,
the ancient elative form of the postposition na followed by the possessive suffix
form of the oblique series surfaces. In such constructions the object of comparasion must precede the predicate. The standard of the comparasion may
be covert and indicated only verbal ending attached to the predicate (verb or
adjective), as in (30a). The common elative forms are addressed in chart (20)114chapter 3table 3.2Pronouns formed from the special stem1 person (1sg, 1du, 1pl)

Special Forms of Personal Pronouns
There are special forms for emphatic personal pronouns. Emphatic clitics can
connect only to these, just like some derivational suffixes. The special stems of
pronouns never appear on their own, only in suffixed form. The stem is followed
by an emphatic suffix (cf. Section 7, in Chapter 16) and the oblique case form of
the possessive suffix. The special stem ends in a -ń consonant, which although
it does not appear overtly, initiates palatalization and nasalization (cf. Section
7.4 in Chapter 2). In third person forms, the special stem has two versions. In
the sections below, which stem is used for the given pronoun form is always
indicated. Table 3.2 shows the special stems and the structure of the personal
pronouns.
Below is an overview of the forms of personal pronouns derived with the
limitative suffix as well as with the various emphatic suffixes.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"

Ordinal numerals take the same inflectional suffixes as cardinal numerals. They
can function as a modifier or as a predicate in the sentence. When used attributively, they must agree partially with the head of the noun phrase—they have
nominative, accusative and genitive forms. The rules of agreement are discussed in Section 1 of Chapter 8 below. The following sentences illustrate the
use of ordinal numerals.

Numeral Adverbs
Numeral adverbs answer the question “how many times”. These are derived
from cardinal numerals and indefinite numerals with an adverb-forming suffix
(adv) that is formally identical to the Plural Genitive suffix. Only the final part
of compounded numerals takes the suffix.

Fractions
Nganasan only uses the fraction helɨə ‘half, part’. Expressions like ‘one and a half,
two and a half’ are complex constructions formed as follows: cardinal numeral
(in nominative form) + noun + helɨə ‘half, part’. The noun can often be omitted.

Quantifiers
There are several quantifiers. Their referent can be human or non-human. They
are used to express the approximate number of entities. These forms are generally used in the singular, but bǝnsǝ ‘all, the whole’ and bǝńďikaa ‘every, all’
can take number markings, as the sentence (141a) shows. A noun following a
quantifier—just like in many other Uralic languages—is in the singular as well
(cf. Section 3 in Chapter 8). The following chart lists the quantifiers. The word
bǝnsǝ has two meanings: ‘all’ and ‘the whole’. The meaning of the plural form is
‘everyone’, while the dual form means ‘both’.

‘few, little’
‘few, small in number’The quantifier bǝnsǝ may appear before (141b) and after the head noun (141a) it

KBD_71_Relationship_nar.008The quantifier bǝnsǝ ‘all, the whole’ can take possessive suffixes as well. In this
case, the meaning is ‘all of us’. The possessive suffix refers to who belongs to the
group. These items always stand by themselves, that is, in this case, they are not
modifiers. The form bǝńďikaa cannot be marked for possessivity.

TKF_061105_MasterOfIdols_flk.464The quantifiers can be used attributively and predicatively. If the indefinite
numeral is in the predicate position, it takes the predicative suffixes, as in sentence (143a). If it remains in the attribute position, it must agree with the head
noun as in (143b).

Conjunctions
Conjunctions are rarely used. Juxtaposition of coordinated phrases or sentences is much more frequent. However, members of the younger generation,
who speak Russian well, also use Russian conjunctions. The word ŋonəə ‘and,
again, furthermore, one more’ can optionally appear as a coordinating conjunction, primarily appearing between coordinated phrases. The Russian i ‘and’
can also be used to fulfill this function. Sentence (144a) demonstrates the
conjunction-like use of ŋonəə, whereas (144b) depicts the use of the Russian
conjunction i. For coordination of clauses see Section 1 in Chapter 13.

Particles
Particles are quite often used. Emphasis is often expressed through morphological means in this language, i.e. emphatic suffixes or particles, which have
discourse-related meaning. Besides emphasis, particles can express conditionality, uncertainty, limitation or negation.
In contrast to Nenets and Enets, there are two negative particle-like element:
ńintu(u) and ďaŋku. Both can be inflected predicatively, i.e. they can take verbal
inflections in present, but no tense marking elements for the future or past. The
particle ńintu(u) is used to negate a non-verbal predicate. The word ďaŋku is
used to negate existential, locative, and possessive sentences. (For use of these
elements see Chapter 12 for negation.)
In general, particles do not take derivational and inflectional suffixes, thus
they are unchangeable. However, several particles can take verbal or nominal inflectional morphemes. For example, ŋɨɁtə- must take a possessive suffix,
while some others, like the negative particles ńintu(u) and ďaŋku can take verbal inflectional suffixes, if they occupy the predicate position in a sentence.
Only the most frequently used particles are discussed below. What position
these words can take in a sentence and which suffixes can attach to them is
given. Particles have not been described in detail, and the analysis of text-level
discourse has yet to be pursued further.
1. əku ‘maybe, probably’: This particle always appears after the predicate, generally at the end of the sentence. The verb in the sentence is mostly in the
indicative, but can take the irrealis marker (for irrealis see Section 4.8 in Chapter 5). The particle ŋəndiɁaiɁ ‘probably’ has a similar meaning also expressing
uncertainty (see below). The auxiliary verb əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe’ discussed in Section 3.3 above also has the same meaning. The auxiliary and the particle clearly
go back to the same proto-form.

This chapter discusses the characteristics of nominal categories and provides
an overview of the inflectional classes. The Northern Samoyedic languages
display highly flectional morphological characteristics concerning case and
numeral suffixes: these are always portmanteau morphemes.
The following grammatical categories are present in the inflection of nouns:
number, case, and possessive personal suffixation. There is no grammatical
gender, and the animate/inanimate contrast also does not have grammatical
correlates. The linear order of inflectional morphemes is as follows:
Singular: base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+case/possessive
marker
Dual:
base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+dual marker+case/
possessive marker
Plural:
base+(derivational suffix)+complex case, number and possessive
marker1Stems and Their FormationThe present section discusses what kind of stems suffixes attach to. Morphemes
(both stems and suffixes) may have an extreme number of allomorphs, far
more than is usual in other Uralic languages. The stems are grouped according
to their morphophonological alternations. Stem morphemes appear in three
forms, called S1, S2, S3 stems.
(a) The S1 stem is identical to the nominative singular form of the noun. This
stem type is not characterized by alternations.
(b) The S2 stem is identical to the genitive/accusative singular form of the
word. It can be also derived from the plural nominative form by deleting the
glottal stop. If the base word ends in a consonant, the stem is augmented with
an epenthetic vowel -ə. The harmonic class of the stem (see Section 7.2 in
Chapter 2) is irrelevant for the formation of S2 stems. If the word contains a
consonant involved in gradation, it occurs in the weak grade in the S2 stem—
a fact that can be explained by the historic genitive marker -ŋ, which has been
lost, but retains its presence in the form of an empty slot word-finally. The last
syllable of the genitive form is thus, always closed, allowing gradation to happen. (For the rules of gradation, see Section 7.1 in Chapter 2.)
© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_005177nominal inflectionThe S1 and S2 stem of vowel-final stems are often identical. Exceptions are
those cases in which a gradation consonant is present in the stem, which
appears in the syllabic weak grade in S2 stems.
(c) The S3 stem is formed from the genitive plural form by removing the case
suffix -Ɂ from vowel-final stems. If the stem ends in a consonant, the S3 stem
gains a connecting vowel, following the suffix harmony rules (e.g. -U: -u/ -ɨ/
-ü/-i). The stem-final vowel in S3 stems is often different from the vowel of S1/S2
stems. Gradation affects gradation consonants in the same way as it does in S2
stem. In the sections below, the different stem types are described in detail. The
following listing gives only the typical stem types:

Vowel-Final Stems
Stems ending in a vowel exhibit two kinds of alternation: consonant gradation
and vowel alternation. In some cases, no change occurs in the stem, i.e. the
form of all three stems is the same, but the most frequent case is that S1 and
S2 are the same, and the stem-final vowel in the S3 stem changes. Usually no
vowel alternation appears in stems ending in -i, -ɨ or a diphthong -ɨ͡a, -i͡a, -u͡a, or
-ü ͡a. Words ending in u- usually alternate, but sometimes the alternation does
not happen. Words with [+backness] value ending in -a usually do not alternate, while words with [-backness] value do. The list below includes words in
which the three stems are the same, meaning, neither vowel alternation nor
consonant gradation occurs in them.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196]"
"18chapter 1Nganasan around the age of 70 were proficient in the language, only 5.9 percent of children under 10 years of age (16 persons) spoke Nganasan. Although
the survey was non-representative, the data clearly show the status of the language. As passing the language to further generations has ceased among the
Nganasans, an irreversible process of language loss has begun.
Until the 20th century, Nganasans had closer contact only with the Enets.
Inter-ethnic marriages were only attested between Nganasans and the Enetses
(cf. Afanasyeva 1990); in these marriages, typically the wives were of Enets origin and switched to using Nganasan. In 1976, inter-ethnic marriages accounted
for one fourth of all Nganasan marriages: 21 per cent of all marriages were
between Nganasans and Enetses, and in the remaining 4 percent, the nonNganasan spouse was of Nenets, Dolgan or Evenki origin. After the settlement
of Nganasans, the traditional Nganasan–Enets relations loosened. Currently,
inter-ethnic marriages are more frequent, Nganasans marry Dolgans or Russians. Krivogonov (1998) reports that 56.9 per cent of women and 30.3 percent
of men lived in an inter-ethnic marriage. Children born to such a marriage typically speak Russian instead of the mother tongue of either of the parents, as this
is the language the parents use to communicate with each other. Therefore, it
can be stated that today the extinction of the language is an irreversible process.
2.4
A Short Typological Overview
Like other Uralic languages, Nganasan is a typical agglutinative language. However, many morphemes consist of more than one morphological meaning.
Thus, the language displays a series of flectional features because several morphemes are cumulative. (For nominal and verbal inflection see Chapters 4 and
5). Some morphemes (suffixes or clitic-like morphemes) are equivalent to lexical items in European languages. (For this morphemes see Chapter 16). Prefixation is absent. Nganasan grammar reflects many characteristics typical of
the Uralic languages, but also some unique features, cf. morphophonological
alternations (see in Chapter 3, Sections 7.1 and 7.3) etc.
The open word classes are verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. These
classes can be distinguished by morphologic, syntactic and semantic criteria,
however adjectives are not clearly distinguished from nouns. There is a set of
relator nouns mostly with the locational semantics that take special (archaic)
markers of the Lative, Locative and Elative cases (See in Section 6 of Chapter 3).
Nouns are inflected for number, case and possession. They can appear in
seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, lative-dative, locative-instrumental, ablative-elative and prolative) and three numbers (singular, dual and
plural). Possessive suffixes convey possessive meaning; indicating the person
and number of the possessor as well as the person and number of the possessedintroduction19entity. Additionally, there is a category typical for the Northern Samoyedic languages, the (pre)destinative (see Section 5 in Chapter 4). Noun phrases display
the determiner and head constituent order. Possessive pronouns are missing.
The verbs have three conjugation types (subjective, objective and reflexive).
They agree with the subject in person and number and can agree with the object in number as well. Contrary to many other Uralic languages, there are three
morphologically expressed future tenses (general future, immediate future and
future-in-the-past). Additionally, Nganasan has two past tenses (past and pluperfect). Verbal stems are classified into two aspectual classes: they are either
imperfective or perfective. Depending on the aspect value, imperfective verbs
describe a present situation in the present tense (aorist), past situation in the
past tense, while perfective verbs denote the immediate past situation in the
present tense (aorist) and remote past situation in the past tense (cf. Section 4.2
in Chapter 5). Additionally to indicative, there are 11 morhologically expressed
verbal moods (imperative, admonitive, optative, interrogative, inferential, reportative, irrealis, necessitative, abessive, dubitative, speculative). Mood and
tense markers cannot be combined. Verb can be modified by a large number of
Aktiosart and modal suffixes as well (see Chapter 16).
As in many other Uralic languages, standard negation is expressed by a negative auxiliary, which is followed by the so called connegative form of the lexical
verb. For negating of constituent a negative particle is used (cf. Chapter 12).
Predicate possession sentences belongs to the existential type, thus the predicate verb is a special existential verb. However, opposed to the majority of
Uralic languages, possession can be expressed by a transitive verb as well. (For
possessive clauses see Section 4 in Chapter 9).
Nganasan is a head-final language and has a non-rigid SOV word order. The
word order in a sentence is motivated by the information structure (cf. Chapter 14). Determiners (inclusive possessors) are always left-branching. According to Holmberg’s classification, Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language
(Holmberg 2005, 2010), in which both, the pronominal subject and in certain circumstances the pronominal object can be omitted in a sentence. The
pronominal object of a sentence is only expressed overtly, if it receives extra
emphasis or if it is in a topic position (see Section 2.1 in Chapter 14). There is
no differential object marking, however the direct object of an imperative sentences can appear in the nominative.
Subordinate clauses are built with non-finite verb forms: participles or nominalized forms, which preserve the argument structure of the base verb. The
use of conjunctions is not typical. Coordination is expressed by the simple
parataxis. Nganasan, like other Samoyedic languages, expresses definiteness
not through articles, but by other means, e.g. with possessive suffixes or word20chapter 1order. (For more on the characteristics of the typology of Samoyedic languages,
see among others Bakró-Nagy 2012, 2006, Hajdú 1985 and Tauli 1963.)
2.5
Orthography
2.5.1
Nganasan as a Written Language
The first official orthography was created by the Samoyedologist Natalya M. Tereshchenko in 1986, but the alphabet was inconsistent and the system has
never been widely used. In 1989, a committee (consisting of A.A. Barbolina,
A.A. Momdye, A.Ch. Momdye, E.A. Helimski) was set up in Dudinka to eliminate inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the Tereschenko system. The final
version of the orthography appeared in 1992. The alphabet employs all the
graphemes of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet and the following additional characters: i, ÿ, ə, ң, Ɂ or ″, the last two symbols represent the glottal stop. The consonant /ð/ is marked by the symbol ⟨δ⟩, but it is often replaced by the Cyrillic
⟨з⟩ or the symbol ⟨ʒ⟩ for typographical reasons.
In sum, the alphabet consists of the following characters:
Ɂ (”), ə, a, б, г, д, δ (з, ʒ), е, ё (ѳ), и, i, й, к, л, м, н, ӈ, o, п, р, с, т, у, ÿ (Ү ), х, ч,
ы, э, ю, я
The parenthesized letters can be used for technical reasons, to replace the
preceding character. Although this is the official alphabet, its use is not compulsory. The usage of characters depends on the author and the editor of a
publication, mainly based on typographic considerations.
Furthermore, loanwords may contain any of the following letters: в, ж, з, ф,
ц, ш, щ, ъ, ь
1. The writing principles—as well as the characters—are adopted from Russian. This means that a palatalized or palatal consonant does not have a
separate grapheme as in the phonological Latin script (e.g. ń [ɲ] versus
n), but the palatality of the consonant is marked by the choice of the following vowel character: an “iotated” vowel (и, ё, я, ю) instead of ы, о, а, у
respectively, e. g. немы [ɲemɨ] ‘mother’, десы [ɉesɨ] ‘father’.
2. Long vowels are marked by doubling the vowel letter: маа [maː] ‘what’. If
there is a palatal consonant preceding the long vowel, the long vowel is
marked by a sequence of an iotated vowel and its non-iotated pair: няа
[ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’. Vowel pairs are as follows: я—а, ю—ÿ, и—i, ё—о.
3. The letter ⟨i⟩ is only used after non-palatal consonants. The grapheme for
a long i [iː] is ⟨iu⟩: miu [tiː] ‘the two of you’.
4. There is no separate symbol to denote the diphthongs [i͡a] and [u͡a] in the
Cyrillic alphabet, these are marked by the letter sequences ⟨ua⟩ and ⟨ ya⟩,21introduction5.respectively. The diphthong [i͡a] is often marked by the Cyrillic letter ⟨я⟩,
e. g. хяӈ [hi͡aŋ] ‘palm’.
The rare vowel sequences /ia/, /üa/ are written as follows:Latin script Cyrillic script Examples
ia
üa6.ea or иа
ёа, юа or ѳадиа or rarely деа [ɉia] ‘brain’
дюату, дёату or дѳату [ɉyatu] ‘s/he disturbs’The assimilation of vowels is often marked in Cyrillic writing. For example, the traditional буəзу ‘word’ [buoðu] form is replaced by буозу.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"

ChND-KES_061107_Dialog_conv.057As can be seen above, the negative existential sentence has the same word order
as the declarative sentence: loc (coda) + theme (pivot) +verb.
Negative locative sentences use the same negative elements as existential
sentences. The following sentences show the structure of the negative locative.
In the negated locative sentence the theme (pivot) element is always definite.
The only difference between existential and locative sentences is the word
order. In locative sentences the theme (pivot) takes the sentence-initial position. If the coda is expressed, it usually appears before the negative element, as
in (17c), but it can take the sentence-final position as well. This may be due to
influence from Russian as in (17d).

this structure is very rare.","[434, 435]"

Present Participle
The present participle (imperfective participle) is used, if the action or property denoted by the participle and the action denoted by the main verb is taking
place simultaneously. The suffix of the present participle -NTUə attaches to the
S1 stem of the verb. If the suffix attaches to an r-final stem, the suffix-initial
consonants are deleted, i.e. the suffix starts with a vowel. In other cases, the
suffix begins with a consonant, whose quality is determined by the phonological rules. The following charts show the form of the suffix and give examples.

the present participle assumes the pre-modifier position, while in sentence (77)
the participle is the predicate of the sentence.

Past Participle
The past participle (perfective participle) is used, if the action denoted by the
participle has been completed before the action denoted by the main verb of
the clause, i.e. it expresses antecedence. The past participle marker is attached
to the S1 stem of the verb: -SUəďəə. This suffix can either be attached to a perfective or an imperfective verb: kuə-ďüəďəə ‘dead, who had died’, barətə-suəďəə
‘who had waited’, ńilɨ-ďiəďəə ‘who had lived’, kəntɨ-ďiəďəə ‘who had frozen’,
ŋuńüntə-sʲüəďəə ‘who had collected’.
The past participle can either be a predicate, as in (78), or a pre-modifier in a
nominal phrase as in (79a–b). As these sentences reflect, the participle can take
possessive suffixes, which refer to an actor of event. Thus, in sentence (79a) the
3sg possessive suffix refers to the dropped agent, who has found the people,
while in sentence (79b) it refers to the polar fox.

Necessitative Participle
The necessitative participle (called by Helimski 1998: 507 as future participle)
refers to an action that is to be fulfilled in the future. The necessitative participle marker attaches to the S1 stem of the verb: -ɁSUTə. The marker can attach to
perfective and imperfective verbs as well: tuj-sʲüðə ‘who is going to arrive’, basu-266chapter 5Ɂsutə ‘who is going to hunt’, tərəu-Ɂsutə ‘who is going to work’ hoðətə-Ɂsutə ‘who
is going to learn’. The necessitative participle is mostly used as a pre-modifier
in a nominal phrase. It should be noted, however, that the necessitative forms
are extremely rarely used.

ChND_061025_Haljmira_flks.149The necessitative participle has a past form, which is formed from the necessitative participle of the verb with the help of the -ďəə nominal past suffix
(cf. Section 6.1.4.2 in Chapter 16). Therefore, the complex suffix has the forms
-ɁSUTəďəə. This participle denotes actions that should have happened: tujsʲüðəďəə ‘who should have come’, melɨðə-Ɂsɨðəďəə ‘who should have made
something’. The form is only used as a pre-modifier in a nominal phrase.

KSM_080804_Village_nar.026The past form of the abessive participle is formed with the help of the -ďəə
nominal past suffix (cf. Section 6.1.4.2 in Chapter 16) attached to the abessive
participle, therefore the complex suffix attached to the S1 stem of the verb is
-məTUmA1Ɂaďəə: kotu-mətumaɁa-ďəə ‘who had not been killed’. This participle is rarely used. There are no examples for this form in the corpus.
6.2.5
Passive Participle
The marker of the passive participle attaches to the S1 stem of a transitive verb,
it is always of the form -məə: ďebtu-məə ‘[the one] told’, kotu-məə ‘[the one]
killed’, čii-məə ‘[the one] hidden’, sočələ-məə ‘[the one] sewn’, biri͡amtɨ-məə ‘[the
one] injured’. It can either take the attributive or the predicate position. Sentence (83b) shows the participle in the pre-modifier position, while in sentence
(83a) it functions as a predicate.

Iterative Participle
The marker for the iterative participle is -KUTə, which is attached to the S1 stem
of the verb. It can be used with perfective and imperfective verbs as well with
the meaning ‘usually do anything, do anything with pleasure’: basu-gutə ‘who
hunts with pleasure’, hu͡aŋku-gutə ‘who drinks with pleasure’, laŋür-kutə ‘who
often shouts’, ŋəjbəu-gutə ‘who loves to work’. The following sentences show
the usage. The participle can take the attribute as well as the predicate position.

Supine Forms
The supine (or purposive converb) is used to form a clause of purpose (cf. Section 3.2 in Chapter 13). The agent of the sentence/act is mostly marked by a
possessive suffix attaching to oblique cases on the supine form of the verb.
There are three kinds of supine forms.
6.3.1
Supine with -nA2Kə
The marker -nA2Kə (-nakə, -nagə, -ni͡akə, -ni͡agə) attaches to the S1 stem of the
verb, and the arising form appears in positive sentences. In negative sentences,
it attaches to the negative auxiliary, as the sentence (86b) below illustrates. The
agent is marked by an oblique form of the possessive suffix following the supine
marker: hoðətə-nagə-nuɁ ‘in order that we learn’, basu-nakə-nə ‘in order that I
hunt’.

KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.0016.3.2
Supine with -ɁsA2
The second supine form has the marker -ɁsA2 (-Ɂsa, -Ɂsi͡a), which is attached to
the S1 stem of the verb. It is used in positive sentences: kačəmə-Ɂsa-ti ‘in order
that the two of them can see’. In negative counterpart the suffix is attached to
the negative auxiliary as in (87b).

MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.114The difference between the usages of the two supine forms, presented above, is
not really clear. Gusev (2005: 23) claims that the two kinds of supine constructions and the action noun with the suffix -bsa are interchangeable. However, it
must be noted, that there is not enough material to prove or disprove Gusev’s
statement.
6.3.3
Negative Supine
This form arise through attaching the marker -mUNKəCTə (-muŋkətə, -mɨŋkətə,
-müŋkətə, -miŋkətə, -muŋgətə, -mɨŋgətə, -müŋgətə, -miŋgətə) to the S1 stem of the270chapter 5verb. This is a complex suffix made up of the action noun forming suffix -mUN(see Section 6.1.2.1 in Chapter 16) and the elative suffix (-KǝCTǝ): ńijku-muŋgətə
‘in order not to sweat’, büü-müŋkətətə ‘in order that you will not go’, ďorələmuŋkətə ‘in order that s/he will not start to cry’. The agent is again marked by a
possessive suffix from the oblique series following the marker. As we have above
seen, negative supine can be expressed by the supine form of the negative auxiliary. The two constructions are synonymous. The negative supine form is only
sporadically attested in texts.

Temporal-Conditional Converbs
All Northern Samoyedic languages have a temporal-conditional nominalized
forms.5 Two types of temporal-conditional converb exist: one refers to condition in the present; the other one refers to the future. Both are formed from the
S1 stem of the verb. Additionally, there is a periphrastic construction composed
of the present conditional form of the BE-verb and the future or past form of
the lexical verb: təi-sʲüə i-hüɁ ‘if it was/existed’, mi-sʲiə ihüɁ ‘if s/he gave’, ńilɨ-ďiə
i-hüɁ ‘if s/he will live’. The markers are presented in chart (89) below:5 For Enets see Siegl 2013b: 326–327, for Nenets Nikolaeva 2014: 110–113.","[282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289]"

verbal and nominal suffixes. These morphemes can occur in three positions.
The morphemes that still preserve their clitic-like characteristics always occur
word-finally, whereas those that are relatively lexicalized precede even tense/
mood suffixes.
7.1
Exclamative
The exclamative clitics -əɨ, -əu, -uɁ attach to vowel final and consonant final
stems in different ways: it follows vowel-final stems, e.g. barusʲi-əi ‘hey, witch’,
but it is inserted before the stem-final consonant, as in ďujkələ-Ɂ > ďujkəl-əu-Ɂ
‘screw it in please!’; konɨ-gu-ðəm ‘let me go’ > konɨ-gu-ð-əu-m ‘let me go finally!’.
The suffix vowels are pronounced long and there is a rise-fall intonation contour on the morpheme. As the sentences below demonstrate, it can attach to540chapter 16all word categories; however, it occurs most frequently with nouns. Example
sentences suggest that suffix harmony is not applied in all cases. The clitic
expresses the exclamative meaning, but it can mark unexpected information
too, thus, it has a mirative usage as well. In this case, it conveys surprise, as in
sentence (54).

TKF_031117_ThreeBrothers_flk.1407.2
Suffix -ŋUTU
The suffix has a meaning ‘finally, definitely, well’. As determined by suffix alternation and gradation rules, the forms of this clitic are -ŋɨtɨ, -ŋutu, -ŋɨðɨ or
-ŋuðu. When attached to a nominal category, this emphatic clitic appears after
the derivational suffixes and possessive morphemes, but before the number
marker, e.g. ńaagəə ‘good’ > ńagəə-ŋutu ‘definitely good’; tibɨjki͡aɁku ‘little boy’
> tɨbɨjki͡a-Ɂku-ŋutu [boy-dim-def] ‘a definitely little boy’; ŋoj ‘leg’ > ŋoj-məŋutu [leg-1sgposs-def] ‘definitely my leg’. To observe the relative positioning
of possessive and number markers, compare sentences (55a–b).

Suffix -Küə ‘all right’
Tis morphemes occurs very frequently and most often attaches to nominal
categories or infinitives. It has the meaning ‘all right’ and it, e.g. bɨɁ ‘water’ >
bɨküə ‘water all right’, ŋomtǝďa ‘sit down’ > ŋomtǝ-güǝ-ďa, ‘all right sit down’542chapter 16(see 58a). It is generally attached to nominal categories before the possessive
or case suffix as sentence (58b) demonstrates. When attached to a verbal stem,
inflections, mood markers, and the aorist marker for imperfective verbs follow it, as in ďüŋar-küə-tü-Ɂ ‘they are noisy’; helɨðɨ-küə-tə-ndɨ-m ‘I am willing
to help you/him/her’. However, the aorist marker for perfective verbs precedes
this clitic, as in sentence (58d). The pre-infinitival position may signal that it has
reached such a stage of grammaticalization that it can be considered a derivational suffix.

Suffix -Cčǝ

pronominal categories. It can be followed by a possessive suffix as well as the
conditional marker and can appear with the definitive clitic -ŋutu which fol-word formation543lows it, as in example (56) above in Section 7.2. The following sentences show
the usage of this clitic. For the pronominal form see Section 4.1.6 in Chapter 3.

MVL_080304_TwoMeryde_flk.2227.5
Suffix -KüCmü ‘but, well, as you know’
This is a frequently occurring morpheme which is generally attached to nominal categories before the possessive or case suffix, but occasionally it appears
on verbs after derivational suffixes or before the infinitive suffix. This suffix can
attach to the special pronominal stems as well (cf. Section 4.1.4, in Chapter 3).
If the suffix attaches to the nominal stem, derivational suffixes can precede
it. Examples: ďeŋkuj ‘trap’ > ďeŋguj-kümü-mə ‘well my trap’; maðə-Ɂə ‘big tent’
[aug] > maðə-Ɂə-gümü ‘well big tent’. Sentences (60a–b) show the suffix used
with a nominal stem, while sentence (61) is an example of a verbal stem.

Suffix -ŋA2lə ‘even, also’
When attached to a nominal category, the emphatic clitic-like suffix -ŋalə
(-ŋi͡alǝ) appears before the destinative and possessive suffix and has an emphatic meaning ‘even’, cf. sentence (62a). This suffix precedes the case endings
and number marking suffixes. This means that, based on how it behaves morphologically, this morpheme is closer to being a derivational morpheme than
to a clitics.

KVB_97_SonOfAPriest_flks.104At the same time, when it is attached to a verb stem, it is usually placed between
the perfective aorist marker and the person marker, as sentence (63a) shows,
but precedes the imperfective aorist marker (63b). The common tense and
mood markers such as past or future follow the suffix -ŋalə (63c). But there
are also examples where it is followed by a derivational suffix. Sentence (63b)
demonstrates a case in which the iterative derivational suffix is placed following -ŋalə, while in sentence (63a) the resultative suffix precedes it. The example
sentences show that in this sense there is no vacillation in this respect: the iterative suffix always occurs after the clitic-like morpheme in every case, regardless
of the speaker.

This suffix is prominently used as an emphasizing element in negative sentences, though it alone does not express negation. It sometimes occurs in affirmative sentences, but only very rarely, and when it is the case, it only has an
emphasizing role (64b). This morpheme can be preceded by other clitic-like
morphemes and derivational suffixes and is followed by inflectional suffixes.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.449It can also attach to verbs. When it is used in a negative sentence, the morpheme is attached to the lexical verb, followed by the connegative form, as in
(65a). In an affirmative sentence, it is placed before the person marker. Both
aorist markers precede it (65a), but all tense and mood markers follow it (65c).","[557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564]"
"1CoordinationIn general, there are three types of coordination: conjunctive, adversative and
disjunctive. Generally, conjunctive coordinated clauses are simply juxtaposed
without any coordinator element (asyndetic coordination); however, there are
some borrowed conjunctions as well. As discussed in Chapter 3, Section 12.1 the
Russian loan conjunction i ‘and’ and the Nganasan word ŋonəə ‘and, again, furthermore’ can also be used as conjunctive conjunctions (monosyndetic coordination). However, it must be pointed out that both elements appear in this
function only extremely rarely. The borrowed Russian coordinator is used only
at the clause level, not at the phrase level. Sentences (1a–b) show coordinated
sentences without any coordinators. For the conjunction-like usage of ŋonǝǝ
see the examples in Chapter 3. Coordinated sentences with i ‘and’ are shown
in examples (2a–b) below. As sentence (1a) illustrates multiple coordination is
also possible.© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_014430chapter 13(1) a. {mənə ŋurəkuə-ďiə-m}, {ma-tini

KECh_080214_Childhood_nar.003Additionally, the temporal adverb tǝgǝtǝ ‘then’ [that-el] can also be used to
connect two clauses as in (3a–b). It always appears in the clause initial position. This adverb can take the possessive suffix which refers to the subject of
the sentence (3b). If the subject of the two sentences is different, the adverb
remains without any possessive suffix (3a). It must be noted that in most cases
in the examples given, this adverb does not function as conjunction, but rather
as a temporal adverb. This strategy is used also in Enets and Nenets. The form of
the conjunction in Enets is točgođ (see Siegl 2013b: 425), in Nenets it is təďekəxət
(see Nikolaeva 2014: 285).

JSM_090809_Life_nar.084Disjunction is usually expressed by simple juxtaposition of finite clauses as in
(7a–b). In this case, the predicate is the same and it can be repeated in both
clauses (7a). In this sentence the subjects of the two clauses are different. In
sentence (7b) the subjects are the same and the predicate is elliptical, but the
objects are different. In a negative sentence, the constituent in the scope of
negation obligatory takes the emphatic morpheme -Kəlʲičə.

Proper Inclusion and Equation
There is no morphological and syntactical difference between proper inclusion
and equation. As the following sentences show, the nominal predicate takes the
verbal endings of the subjective conjugation, cf. (31c–d). Nominal categories
with a possessive suffix cannot take a predicative suffix when used as a predicate. In such sentences, the subject must appear overtly and the nominal category only receives the possessive suffix. Furthermore, the personal pronoun
in its possessive function must also appear in the sentence. In past and future
sentences, the copula takes the tense marker.

Inferential
The inferential mood can denote evidential meaning: if the speaker does not
witness the event or action s/he is speaking about, but the circumstances suggest the event is taking place and the speaker is fairly certain that the event
took place, the inferential form is used. This mood, however, is more frequently
used to express an admirative meaning: surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony or
sarcasm. The marker of this mood is attached to the S1 stem. The inferential has
only one temporal form, the aorist and two mood markers, one for subjective
and objective conjugations for one or two objects, and another for reflexive and
objective conjugations for more than two objects. Table 5.11 exhibits the mood
markers.
The following example shows the usage of the inferential mood expressing
evidentiality.","[267, 268, 269]"

MVL_09ß007_Hungabtadja_flks.671The verb ŋuðasa ‘own’ also expresses possession. This verb can be used to
express an inalienable possessive relation. The relation between the possessor
and the possessed is stable in time and the possessor controls the relation, i.e.
[+stable time] and [+control] features can be associated with this relation. The
possessor functions as the subject, while the possessed is the direct object in
the accusative. This structure emphasizes the existence of the possessive relation. Such sentences are considerably rarer than the previous type; there is only
one example for this construction in the corpus. The following two sentences

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.161chapter 10Simple Sentences
Sentences are generally grouped into two categories according to the way in
which the relationship to the predicate is expressed namely: simple or complex sentences. This chapter deals with simple sentences.
The syntax of Nganasan has not been thoroughly explored. There are only
few works that have dealt with syntactic problems. In her monographic work
dedicated to the syntax of Samoyedic languages (1973), Tereschenko only enumerates the types of sentences which exist. In a grammar of Nganasan by the
same author (1979), semantic and syntactic issues are not considered at all. The
summary below highlights and discusses the most important questions, but it
is not an exhaustive account.
Nganasan is a head-final SOV language; however, head-finality is not rigid.
Word order is basically determined by the information structure of the sentence (for more detail see in Chapter 14). Head-finality is obligatory in phrases
containing a noun, such as possessive phrases (head: noun) and postpositional
phrases (head: postposition). Contrarily, in attributive phrases the adjective
can follow the head noun (cf. Section 1 in Chapter 8). Question words tend to
appear at the beginning of the sentence, but they sometimes occur in a more
internal position (see Section 2.2.2 below).
The most important grammatical relations are easily discovered in a sentence, as these are morphologically marked. An overt subject is not a compulsory element of a sentence; according to Holmberg’s terminology (2005)
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language. There are no general pronouns
(like one in English or si in Italian) in Nganasan.
Nganasan is an accusative-nominative language, as the unmarked element
in an active sentence is the subject and the agent. However, the object may be
unmarked as well, if it is in a third person pronoun as the inflectional suffixes
can refer to a third person object. Thus Nganasan in not only a subject prodrop, but also an object pro-drop language. The personal pronouns have the
same form in the role of an object and subject. (For information about the flexion of personal pronouns see Section 4.1 in Chapter 3, for object marking see
Section 1.2 below).© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_011364
1chapter 10Clause Participant and Grammatical Relations in SentencesThis section describes the basic grammatical relations in a sentence, with special emphasis on case marking. The subject and the object can be indentified
by a number of criteria, wich are discussed below.
1.1
Subject
As stated above, Nganasan belongs to the nominative–accusative languages.
Therefore, the overt subject of an intransitive and a transitive active sentence
gets the same case marker, namely the nominative case in clauses with finite
verb and with non-verbal predicate as well. There is no distinction between an
agentive and a non-agentive subject or human and non-human subject. The
predicate must agree in person and number with the subject (see Section 1.1.1
below). The grammatical subject of the sentence tends to appear in the sentence initial position, but adverbs and question words can precede it. Typical
subjects are expressed by a nominal phrase, which is composed of a modified
noun (1a), a simple noun, (1b) or a pronoun (1c).

ASS_161024_Life_nar.015Negative purposive meaning is built with the help of the negative supine
marker -mUŋgətə. In this structure, the subject is also marked by the possessive suffix. The use of the negative supine is rare. Instead of a negative supine
marker, the speakers mostly use the supine form of the negative auxiliary as
(29b) shows. The two constructions are fully synonymous. The same speaker
can use both structures.

This pronoun means something like ‘well, not + pronoun’. The stem final consonant of the pronominal stem surfaces as a nasal homorganic with -b, following
the rules of assimilation. The suffix itself is most likely complex, composed of

answer is ‘yes’, this pronoun cannot be used. This form cannot be used in sentences with a past meaning, i.e. they never appear with a past tense verb or
a perfective verb with an aorist coaffix. According to the language assistant
(TNK), the sentence *mɨm-bülʲatə-nə ńakəlʲi-Ɂə-Ɂ is ill-formed. In past tense,
the same meaning is expressed by pronouns with -kəlʲičə (see Section 4.1.6.3
above).","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"
"3Existential and Locative ClausesExistential and locative clauses are rather similar in general. Usually sentences
are regarded as existential in which the speaker states something about the
existence or non-existence of something or someone. According to the definition offered by McNally (2011: 1830), these constructions are specialized or354chapter 9non-canonical. Three major elements can be identified in locative and existential sentences: the entity (mostly an NP) about whose existence or location
something is stated (theme or pivot), the location in which the given entity
is or exists (locative phrase or coda) and the element (copula) connecting
the theme/pivot and the location/coda. According to the definition by Freeze
(2001: 941) or Milsark (1977) the entity, the existence or non-existence of which
is stated, must be indefinite in an existential clause, but it must be definite in a
locative clause.
The present section addresses the question how these two different types of
sentences—existential and locative—are expressed in Nganasan. As described
below, case marking does not play a role here—instead, the choice of verb is the
decisive factor in what interpretation a given sentence obtains. There are three
copula verbs in Nganasan: the “bare” copula isʲa ‘be’, the copula təisʲa ‘exist, be
present’, and the copula tənijsʲa ‘exist, be there’. One of the numerous interesting characteristics of Nganasan is that at least two copulas (təisʲa, tənijsʲa) can
be used in existential sentences. Both copulas were formed by the lexicalization of a pronominal stem (tə-) + BE verb (isʲa) combination, i.e. this structure
represents a grammaticalized pro-form for existential expression. The stem təappears for example in the pronoun təti ‘that, this’ and in some adverbials as təndə ‘there [lat]’, tə-ni ‘here [loc]’. While in English the pro-form ‘there’ and in
German the expletive pro-form (es) moves to the position of the grammatical
subject, in Nganasan the element tə can only appear directly before the copula, and other sentence parts precede this complex verb. This position probably
contributed to the prefixation of the pro-form to the verb. In the complex verb
tənijsʲa the copula is preceded by the adverbial locative form (təni) of the təpronominal stem. First existential sentences are discussed, followed by locative sentences.
3.1
Existential Clause
Of the Samoyedic languages, Nganasan offers the widest range of possibilities
concerning which existential sentences can be formed, namely, with or without copulas. In the existential constructions both existential copulas are used.
One is used to express existence in a place, thus this kind of sentences normally
has a locative (coda), while the other is used to express abstract existence or to
make a general statement. In the latter case, as can be seen below, a locative
element never occurs in the sentence.
The existential verb təisʲa ‘exist, be’ appears most often in existential clauses.
It is just as frequent in possessive constructions, but—as described in Section
4.1 below—these two constructions resemble each other in other respects as
well. This verb can take tense markers, so it can be used in past and future
as well, as in sentence (36b) below. The word order in sentences is coda–types of predicate355pivot–copula, which Freeze (1992) found in SOV languages. This construction is used to express existence in a place.

KES_031115_Paris_nar.057In most cases, the coda is not expressed in the sentence, but it can be overt. If

KES_031115_Paris_nar.232356chapter 9In the corpus there are some, admittedly, very few, sentences in which the
word order is the same as in existential sentences, but in which the BE verb
(isʲa) is used, rather than one of the two existential verbs, as in (39).

KNT_940903_KehyLuu.011Copulaless existential sentences are far less frequent than those with a copula.
As shown in the following example, these sentences can be formed without a
verb form of any kind. This kind of construction appears in tales as one of the
introductory sentences.
(40) təndə
kuəďə ńi-ni
ŋuɁəj maɁ.
this.gen hill.gen on-adv.loc one tent
‘On this hill (there is) a tent.’
JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.004The constituent order in this kind of existential sentences is coda—pivot.
This, of course, does not allow for any speculations as to where the copula
would be, if there were one. This structure is probably used due to Russian influence. As for existential clauses in Russian, the word order is coda–(copula)–
pivot. The emergence of a parallel structure underpins the suggestion that
word order changes due to the influence of Russian. In any case, it must be
noted that this way of forming existential sentences is far less frequent than
the two other types presented above, and it only appears in narrative texts.
The pivot of existential sentences can be modified with numerals (number
determiners), number marking (in case of Nganasan, the plural and the dual)
and with quantifiers. Sentence (41a) below shows that a numeral can modify a
pivot without making it definite. The same is true for number marking, illustrated in (41b).

Locative Clauses
In a locative sentence, the existential verb introduced above (tǝisʲa) can occur,
but regularly it is the BE-verb (isʲa). In locative clauses, the word order is
pivot—coda—copula, but in elicited sentences pivot—copula—coda
was also accepted and used by native speakers, although in texts it appears less
frequently. Sentence (42) is an example with the verb isʲa ‘be’, while in sentence
(43) the speaker uses the existential verb tǝisʲa. In this sentence, the location is
not specifically mentioned.

‘There, a little way away, your sledge is (there).’
KTD_NN_SeuMelangana_flks.1149In a locative sentence the pivot must be definite. Demonstratives express definiteness, as in sentence (42) above the demonstrative təti ‘that’ specifies the
pivot. Possessive suffixes can express a real possessive relation as well, and
make the entity definite, as in sentence (43) the 2nd person possessive suffix
-rə which attaches to the word ‘sledge’. A noun may also lack explicit marking.
In that case, the pivot does not carry any possessive suffix nor is it preceded by
a demonstrative pronoun; the interpretation of the pivot as [+definite] is only
based on word order and the choice of the copula. The following sentences
show such unmarked noun phrases in the pivot role. Both pivot–coda–
copula and pivot–copula–coda order can be used, however the copula
coda word order is not common in the corpus, but it appears in elicited data. It
is probably a Russian influence. Indeed, in a locative sentence, the pivot always
precedes the coda.","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376]"

Overview of Previous Works
The first attestations of the Nganasan language are relatively late. The first
word list, which sporadically contains some Nganasan material was compiled
by the English travelling merchant Richard James in 1618–1620. However, in
his notes James does not explicitly mention the Nganasans. Daniel Gottlieb
Messerschmidt (1685–1735) was the first to document words in the 18th century. Not earlier than a century later, in 1823, this material was made available to the public in the work Asia Polyglotta by Julius Klapproth (1783–1835).
Also, a few Nganasan words can be found in the book Das Nord-Ostliche Theil
von Europa und Asia (1730) by the Swedish officer Philipp Johann Strahlenberg, who collected data from different languages during his time in exile in
Siberia. This work includes a comparative word list in which the words of the
languages are compared to corresponding lexemes of among others, the Hungarian language. Gerhard Friedrich Müller (1705–1783), the German scientist,
who led a scientific group on the second (great) Kamchatka expedition (1733–
1743) also collected, among historical and geographical materials, word lists and24chapter 1a few sentences from several Siberian languages including Nganasan. These
materials, except for the geographical and historical parts of his works, are
unfortunately still unpublished (see Helimski 2001). The polyglot vocabulary
Linguarum totius orbis vocabularia comparativa (1786–1789) compiled by Peter
Simon Pallas also includes some relevant language data. Word lists of different
length and comparative tables are included in his itineraries (1776). Pallas had
also used Müllers materials. All these data cannot or, only in a limited manner,
be used for linguistic analysis.
The first systematic data collection was performed by the Finnish scholar
Matthias Alexander Castrén (1813–1852), the first prominent scholar of Samoyedology. Castrén made conducted expeditions among the Uralic peoples and
started investigating Samoyedic languages in 1842. His third field trip lasted
from 1845 to 1849. Although he spent only a few weeks on the Taimyr Peninsula, the Nganasan and Enets language material he collected during this time
is appreciated as an important milestone in the research of both languages. In
1849, health problems forced him to leave Siberia. Once home, he started systematizing the material collected, but his early death impeded the completion
of his work. His manuscripts were edited by Anton Schiefner. The work entitled
Nordische Reisen und Forschungen von M.A. Castrén appeared between 1853 and
1862 in 12 volumes. It includes a grammar of Samoyedic languages (1854) and
a Samoyedic vocabulary (1855). Schiefner has simplified the notation applied
in the manuscript and often refrained from indicating dialectal differences.
Nevertheless, the work is one of the most important sources in Samoyedology.
Castrén’s merit is highlighted by the fact that, for a long time, no progress has
been made in the studies on Nganasan. From the time after the Russian revolution, only the short grammar by G.N. Prokofjev, published in 1937 is worth
mentioning. This grammar however does not represent substantial advancement as it partly relies on the data discussed by Castrén.
One of the most prominent researchers in the second half of the 20th century was Natalya M. Tereshchenko (1908–1987), who was also an expert on the
two other Northern Samoyedic languages, Nenets and Enets. Tereshchenko’s
first noteworthy studies on the Nganasan language were published in the 1960s
(e.g. Tereshchenko 1966). Her monographic description from 1979 represents a
culmination and synthesis of her oeuvre. However, the fact that it completely
lacks a syntactic description represents a limitation of the monograph. This
also partly holds true for the phonological description.
Between 1968 and 1972, several scholars from the Duľson School from Tomsk
have carried out fieldwork among the Nganasans and collected grammatical
data, word lists, and texts. Part of these texts were published in the series Skazkiintroduction25Narodov Severa (Tales of the Peoples of North Siberia, 1976, 1980, 1981), but a
good portion of these materials still have yet to be analysed and published.
The Hungarian scholar Tibor Mikola (1936–2000) was the first to provide
modern linguistic descriptions based on his work with a speaker of Nganasan
in Leningrad in 1968. A very short grammatical sketch attached to the texts collected was published in 1970.
Substantial contributions to the study of the Nganasan language were made
by Eugen Helimski (1950–2007), whose work represents an important milestone in modern studies. One of Helimski’s most significant achievements
was the description of the system of complex morphophonological rules such
as: syllabic gradation, rhythmical gradation, nunnation, and vowel harmony
(Helimski 1994a, 1995, 1998). This was an essential contribution to the description of the language, as the above-mentioned phenomena had only been briefly
dealt with in the previous literature.
Even though several additional texts have been published since the publications of texts by Mikola, there is still little published text material available in
Nganasan. The collections edited by Kazis Labanauskas (1942–2002), who lived
in Dudinka for several decades are also noteworthy (1992, 2001). Labanauskas’
latest text collection (2001) was translated into German by Michael Katzschmann. Based on these texts, Katzschmann compiled a grammatical description
of Nganasan (2008).
The practical Nganasan-Russian-Nganasan dictionary, compiled by T. Ju.
Zhdanova with the help of two native speakers Nadezhda T. Kosterkina (1952–
2005) and Aleksander Ch. Momde (1945–2001), deserves special mention. This
difficult to access dictionary is a useful tool for language learners since it provides word base variants as well as additional morphophonological information.
In the 1980s, research on grammar intensified. Ekaterina Boľdt deals in her
monograph with nominal derivation (1989). Wagner-Nagy in her monograph
investigated word-formation in general (2001), and she compiled a text book
and short grammatical description in 2002, in which some essential point of
phonology, morphology and syntax were raised.
Syntax is a less well investigated area; there are hardly any monographic
descriptions in this field. After Tereshchenko’s monograph on Samoyedic syntax (1973) only the work of Kovalenko (1992) dealt with syntax.
Recently Nganasan language corpora with interlinear glosses have also been
made available via the internet.7

Language Data for This Study
In this grammar, fieldwork materials are analysed which were collected during several field trips between 1937 and 2016. The transcripts are part of the
Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC), which has been created as part of
the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan project (supported by the
German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1) whose primary goal is to generate a digital, searchable corpus of spoken Nganasan. During fieldwork sessions, at least
two types of language data are collected: (1) elicited sentences aiming to clarify grammatical or lexicological questions, (2) texts and songs. My fieldwork
materials, which are part of the corpus, consists of data collected during four
fieldwork trips, carried out in 1994, 1996, 2008, and 2016. Altogether, I spent four
months in Usť-Avam, and in Dudinka as well as working with language consultants in Moscow.
The grammatical description in this volume is based on language data from
the Avam dialect. It relies on existing grammatical descriptions (e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.), language data derived from fieldwork
text collections, and elicited data. For illustrating grammatical phenomena, I
prefer to provide sentences from the collected texts over elicited sentences.
Syntactical and pragmatic phenomena can only seldom be demonstrated using
elicited sentences. As concerns these data, I assume a considerable Russian
influence (especially in the case of word order), which is a limitation of these
data. However, there are certain phenomena in the corpus data which proved
to be of little or no use. In this case, I use elicited data. The examples are provided with glosses and English translations. The glosses will be presented using
a slightly modified version of the Leipzig Glossing Rules (LGR).

Basic Information on the Corpus
This corpus contains materials collected by the following researchers or recorded by colleagues of the Taimyr Radio: Ekaterina Boľdt (1971), Josefina
Budzisch (2016), Maria Brykina (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009), Mikhail
Daniel (2003, 2004, 2006), Oksana Dobzhanskaya (2006), Valentin Gusevwere published [http://www.univie.ac.at/negation/sprachen/nganasana.html]. The project
was supported by Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Within the framework of the LangueDOC
project that was carried out in Moscow, 8 texts (comprising altogether 322 sentences) were
glossed by Valentin Gusev. Part of these texts are everyday stories, part of them are tales
[http://www.philol.msu.ru/~languedoc/eng/ngan/corpus.php]. Gusev published 54 texts as
word documents in the project Ethnocultural Interaction in Eurasia (2003–2005). The “corpus” comprises 14,928 sentences and about 28,000 word forms. [http://www.iling‑ran.ru/

(1971, 1972), Natalya Tereshchenko (unknown year), Beáta Wagner-Nagy (1994,
1996, 2008, 2016). Only a small part of these materials was ever published. I
would like to thank all colleagues who have shared their material with me
and who permitted me to work with them and to build a corpus from these
resources. The basic information from the corpus is given in Table 1.4.
The shortest text consists of only two sentences, while the longest text consists of 836 sentences (and 4,946 tokens). The first data was collected by Prokofjev in 1933 from Torunte Kosterkin (see Prokofjev 1937). This is the first text ever
published in Nganasan. The latest transcriptions are from 2016. Figure 1.4 below
shows the number of collected sentences per year. As can be seen, the majority of materials were gathered in 2008, in this year, two fieldworks were carried
out, one in Volochanka and the other one in Ust’-Avam.
The corpus consists of various genres: (1) three types of folklore texts (tales,
myths etc.): siteby, dyurymy and underspecified folklore texts, (2) narratives
(every day stories, biographies etc.), (3) songs and (4) spontaneous and stimulated conversations (topic not specified). The majority of the texts represent
the genre folklore, and it must be pointed out that two genres are underrepresented. None of these are songs. We have many songs, but this type of text
is unique and is not convenient for illustrating grammatical phenomena. The
other underrepresented genre is conversation. The reason for this being that
conversation is hard to record and very difficult to transcribe. There are very
few situations wherein the speakers converse in Nganasan. Figure 1.5 shows the
balance of the genres in the corpus.
The first and second version of the corpus has been already published (Brykina et al. 2016, 2018). In this study, I used the entire corpus, not only the published versions. Elicited data are not part of this corpus, but they are used in
the grammar.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]"

ChNS_080302_Bear_nar.005Quite frequently, this meaning is expressed with the help of the particle ŋɨɨtə‘not yet’ and simple negation. The sentence pair below shows the two ways to
express similar meaning. In sentence (67a) the speaker supposes that the eventverbal inflection259is going to take place. In this case, the speaker is sure to go hunting soon. In sentence (67b), however, there is no sign of presupposition from the speaker. For
this reason, in this sentence the abessive mood is not used, the verb appears in
indicative. In both cases the speaker is not hunting at the moment.

Dubitative
This mood is applied by the speaker, if s/he intends to express uncertainty,
doubt or surprise. The dubitative marker is attached to the S1 stem and has
the form -LU (-lɨ, -lʲi, -lu, -lʲü). The sentences are often questions without the
interrogative marker present on the verb, as in (68b). The following sentences
show the usage of the dubitative mood.

it cannot use without the mood marker and the sentence obligatory contains
a question word. Further investigation into the meaning of this construction is
required. The following two sentences show the verb form with the two dubitative markers. According the language assistants, this construction cannot have
a past reference.

Speculative
The speculative mood is an epistemic mood, expressing the speaker’s assumption that the event might take place in a past with a present time result. This
expresses the meaning ‘it seems’. More rarely it can have a meaning conveying evidentiality. This is described in Chapter 6 below. (See also Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.)
This mood is also mentioned in descriptions about Enets (Siegl 2013b: 288),
as well as in Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014: 101, she calls it the “approximative”). The
speculative mood is complex, the mood marker consists of a participle present
suffix (-NTUǝ, cf. Section 6.2.1 below) followed by the similative suffix -RǝKU
and the verbal personal endings, as in sentences (70a–b). According to the time
reference of the present participle, this form has a present time reference. In
contrast to Nenets, the past form is complex and it is not built using a past participle, but the speculative form of the main verb is accompanied by the past
tense form of the BE-verb, as in (71a–b). The speculative form is documented
not only with personal endings from the subjective conjugation, but with endings of the objective and reflexive conjugations as well, as in (70b) and (71a),
thus this category is a fully grammaticalized form. The future form however, is
not attested.","[276, 277, 278, 279]"

JSM_090809_Life_nar.351Inferential meaning can be expressed by the verb ńantɨďi ‘seem’ as well. This
verb is imperfective and cannot take a tense marker. Conveying this meaning
with the mood marker is also not common, there are only interrogative forms
attested. In most cases, this verb appears in the 3sg form, but there are very
few examples in which the verb agrees with the subject, as in sentence (5b)
below.

‘You seem to be poor, with your reindeer; you seem to be miserable with

JSM_090809_Life_nar.161The predicate in sentence (5b) is non-verbal (poor and miserable), the use of
the verb ńantɨďi is copula-like. It must be stressed however that the BE-verb can
appear in the copula position as well. However, in the latter case, the reading of
the sentence is not evidential. The examples demonstrate that, if the speaker
references momentary evidence, he uses the verb ńantɨďi, but if the statement
is general, the speaker uses the inferential form of the BE-verb. In sentence (6)evidentiality279the narrator of the tale says that in general, the small animals are bad, thus they
are unable to hunt.

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.017The verb ńantɨďi is typically used for quotations, as in sentence (7). (For more
about the usage of this verb and of the inferential mood, see Szeverényi &
Wagner-Nagy 2017b.) In the quoted clause, the negative auxiliary does not take
the inferential suffix, but the 3sg form of the verb ńantɨďi appears as a particle.

KES_031115_Paris_nar_1942Reported EvidentialityAs was mentioned in Section 5.7 in Chapter 5, the reportative mood marks
second-hand information, meaning the speaker heard about the action or
event from a secondary source, as in sentences (8) and (9) below. In sentence
(8) the speaker was present during the event, but she was only a new-born baby
and thus, she heard about this event only from someone else’s narration, as she
cannot remember it. Sentences (9a–b) depict a quotation. The speaker narrates
what the girl said to him.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.478The speaker may refer to the narration of a certain person, but reportative can
also be used to speak about events that are generally spoken about in the community. This mood is very often used, if a story is told about a certain person. In
this case, the feeling of reality is enhanced by the usage of the mood. It must be
noted, however, that tales and myths are told in the indicative and not in reportative mood. In a folklore text, the reportative mood appears, if the story teller
reports anything or the information comes from a specific person (see sentence
8 above). During shamanic ceremonies, the shaman reports the information
heard from gods in the renarrative to those present. Normally, the information
source is not specified, but in some cases the specific person can be expressed.
In this case, the reportative form semantically expresses the quotative, as in
sentence (10).

‘I will tell the children a small tale, not a tale, a simple story.’
MACh_93_TwoTales_flkd.001The most usual order of the constituent in a construction with the verb ďebtuďa ‘tell’ is (A) T AD V, as in sentence (3c), but if the theme is topicalized as in
sentence (3b), it takes the preverbal position and the addressee moves into the
postverbal position. Thus, if the agent is present, it always takes the preverbal
position and always precedes the addressee.
The verb munuďa behaves differently. As example (3a) demonstrates, this
verb normally appears in the main clause, and the subordinate clause is its
theme argument, which is normally expressed as indirect speech in languages
that have it—Nganasan, does not (see Section 3 in Chapter 14). This verb cannot be used with substantives like sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ and ďürɨmɨ ‘story’ as objects. As
mentioned in Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10, the verb ‘what say’ does not have any
argument, the question word is incorporated into the verb. (For the structure
see example (49b) in Chapter 10.) So, there is a semantic difference between
the two verbs and their argument structures differ accordingly.
Personal pronouns cannot take case markers and cannot be inflected in
the same manner as other nominal categories, thus if the recipient-like argument is pronominal, the speaker must use a different construction to code the
recipient. The oblique case forms of pronouns are replaced with postpositional
structures (see Section 4.1.1 in Chapter 3). In this case, the postposition ďa is
followed by the destinative suffix -Tə (-tə, -ðə), and by the oblique case form ofditransitive constructions399possessive suffixes: ďatə-poss and ďaðə-poss. (For the paradigm, see Section
4.1.1 in Chapter 3). The pronominal addressee is mostly covert; it appears overtly
only to express emphasis. The personal pronoun can precede the postposition
(4b). If the special interrogative speech act verb kumunsa ‘what tell’ is used, the
theme argument cannot be expressed lexically (4a).

JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.0771.2.2
Physical Transfer
The recipient of a verb expressing physical transfer is expressed by a postpositional construction with na ‘to, near’, if it is pronominal. It takes a possessive
suffix from the oblique series which denotes the person of the recipient. This
postposition is optionally accompanied by a personal pronoun. The recipient400chapter 11takes the preverbal position, and the theme is always placed before the recipient, but it is possible to insert another phrase between them. So, in sentence
(6a) the agent, and in (6b), an anaphoric pronoun is inserted between the recipient and the theme. The word order is Th R V.

Covert Recipient and Addressee
The recipient and adressee must not be overtly expressed in a Nganasan ditransitive construction. If the recipient/addressee is a pronoun, it may also be omitted. But if the recipient/addressee is pronominal, the theme argument must
take a destinative marker (cf. Section 5, Chapter 4) and have a possessive suffix
referring to the recipient/addressee (possessive strategy). Thus, in a ditransitive
construction neither the agent nor the recipient/addressee must be expressed
by a lexical element; a morphological marker can refer to them. The agent is
encoded through verbal morphology, with the verbal personal ending, while
the recipient/addressee is encoded through nominal morphology, with the possessive suffix showing the person and number of the recipient/addressee. This
construction is illustrated with the following examples:

KES_031115_Paris_nar.320The same construction appears in passive sentences. In such cases, the agent is
never omitted, and the theme argument moves to the topic position. The recipient is expressed with the possessive suffix on the theme. The verb is always in
the reflexive conjugation and, of course, it agrees with the grammatical subject
of the sentence, that is, with the theme. This construction may occur with the
verb ‘give’ (9), but it is most often used with speech act verbs (8). In sentences
wit speech act verbs, the agent cannot be overt.

JSM_080212_Mosquitos_flkd.1612Coding the BeneficiaryThe beneficiary is an entity for whose benefit the action was performed. As can
be seen, there is a contrast between the coding of the recipient and the coding of the beneficiary. As we have seen before, the recipient NP takes the lative
marker; for a benefactive NP this is not possible, and it can either be coded with
the allative or—like a recipient—may remain covert.
2.1
Postpositional Coding
If the beneficiary is an NP or expressed with the demonstrative pronouns used
as personal pronouns, the construction is postpositional and the postposition402chapter 11ďaðiɁkü ~ ďaðükü ‘for, for the sake of’ must be used. The stem of this postposition is the postposition ďa, the origin of the other constituent is unclear.
If the beneficiary is expressed by a pronoun or demonstrative (10a) the
postposition takes the possessive suffix corresponding to person and number. This construction can only express a beneficiary, if the NP has the feature
[+human]. In other instances, the postposition is either an allative marker of
direction or expresses the meaning of ‘for the sake of’. The word order is always
beneficiary—theme.

KNT_940903_KehyLuu.178Similar to the recipient, the beneficiary can also be covert in the sentence. In
this case, the destinative suffix and the possessive suffix indicate the person
and the number of the beneficiary, as seen in sentences in (11). The NP marked
with the destinative is the theme of the ditransitive construction. The agent
of the sentence is almost always expressed with only the verbal ending, if it is
overt as in (11c), it takes the clause-initial position.

ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.063When destinative NPs function as subjects of the intransitive sentence, the construction can also be qualified as benefactive. This construction occurs rarely.
The NP appears in the subject position and takes the destinative suffix (-tǝ/-ðǝ)
and the possessive suffix. The possessive suffix indicates the number and person of the beneficiary. Subject destinative NPs take possessive markers for the
nominative only. This construction is not very frequent, only 10 % of the benefactive constructions are of this type. Most often, this sentence type contains
the verbs tujsʲa ‘come’, ŋǝtumsa ‘become visible; be born’ and the negative particle ďaŋku. For a depiction of the structure, see the sentences in (12). This kind
of construction appears not only in Nganasan, but also in Enets (cf. Khanina &
Shluisky 2014).

ChND_041212_Girl_flkd.1413Coding the ThemeAs has already been mentioned, the theme of the ditransitive sentence in most
cases remains in the accusative. Passive sentences are exceptions; for more on
this, see Section 1.3 above. With imperative forms, the theme is in the nominative; for more on the form of the imperative object, see Section 1.2.4, Chapter 10.
The personal suffix of the verb may also indicate the direct object, thus the
theme can be overt under certain circumstances, as in (13a–b). However, this
is only possible, if the theme has already been indicated in the preceding sentences, so in the given sentences it would be possible to use only the personal
pronoun. In these cases, the personal endings on the verb are used to indicate
the theme instead of a personal pronoun. Normally, the agent in such cases is
also not overt.

KES_031115_Paris_nar.071As we have seen above, the passivized verb can take further derivational suffixes, such as habituative (20b) and inferential (20c); furthermore, it can be
turned into a noun or a participle via derivational suffixation. The participle
form of the passivized verb forms a kind of passive NP (one kind of relative
clause), as in sentence (22) below. This structure is not used very often. (For
relative clause, see Section 4 in Chapter 13).

With Passive Participle
Another way of forming passive sentences is the usage of passive participles
(-mǝǝ). The participle can appear in an attribute as well as in a predicate position. If the passive participle takes the predicate position, the predicate of the
sentence is non-verbal, thus it shows agreement with the subject in number
and person. These constructions describe events when a constant state (result
of the preceding action) is arrived at. The described property is an immanent property of the subject. The grammatical subject of the sentence is the
theme/patient. This structure is like resultative structures in that here, the
action produces a result. The participle cannot carry tense or mood markers.
The tense relation or mood appears on the copula verb, as in sentence (24a–b).

this position.

Type of Passive Sentences
Most passive sentences do not have a lexically expressed agent; only very few
sentences (1,4%) have an adjunct with the thematic role of agent. First, constructions having the expression of agent are shown. Then the construction for
covert agent will be described, and the impersonal construction will be illustrated.","[314, 315, 316, 317]"

JDH_00_Njaakju_flkd.193Causative structures are used, if the sentence expresses that the event was
caused by something or somebody. Nganasan expresses causation by morphological means, i.e. not with the help of auxiliaries or other verbs. In this case,
the complex causative (factitive) derivational suffix -RUbtU (-rɨbtɨ, -rubtu etc.)
is attached to the transitive verbs. In a causative structure, a new argument, the
causer, appears in the argument structure of the predicate. The causer can be
omitted from the structure, as the inflectional suffix on the verb marks person
and number. An omitted causer is marked by parentheses below. Weather verbs
cannot take a causative suffix. The cause is marked by lative case, compare the
following sentences.

KNT, 1994The above sentences displayed morphological causative, in which a single,
derived verb expresses causation. Lexical causation, i.e. when a suppletive verb
pair expresses causation, is very restricted. Such an example is a verb pair
meaning numəďa ‘wake up’ and kitiďi ‘wake somebody up’. The corpus does
not contain a verb with the stem numəďa and a causative suffix, and the verb
kitiďi grammatically behaves like a numəďa + causative suffix word should. This
is illustrated by the following elicited sentence pair.

KNT, 19942.4.2
Detransitivization
Decausative structures arise, when a semantically causative sentence is
changed in such a way that the causer disappears. Typical decausative structures are formed by medial and perception verbs. In case of medial verbs,
generally, transitive verbs are used medially. There is no derivational difference
between causative–medial verb pairs; they only differ in their inflection properties (see also Section 3 in Chapter 5). The same verbs in medial usage take
the inflectional suffixes of the reflexive conjugation, while transitive verbs have
two arguments, and take the inflectional suffixes either of the subjective or of
the objective conjugation. The direct object of a transitive verb becomes the
subject of the medial verb. The following sentence pair shows the use of medialtransitive verbs.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.356chapter 8The Structure of the Noun Phrase
This chapter discusses the structure and the major function of a noun phrase
(NP). The most common noun phrase is comprised of a single noun. Pronouns
can also serve as the head of an NP, but these cannot be modified. Pre-modifiers
can be of the following categories: adjective, demonstratives, indefinites, quantifiers, personal pronoun (serving as a possessive pronoun) numeral, and relative clauses. The relative clause is discussed in Section 4 of Chapter 13.
A noun phrase is typically head-final: it is composed of an optional premodifier and a noun head, thus the basic structure of the noun phrase is as
follows: (det)-(num/quant)-(adj)-noun. In some cases, the modifier follows the head (see Section 1 below).
The core syntactical functions of the NP is to express the subject or object
in a sentence, but they can be marked denoting various oblique cases and they

a sentence as well. This sentence type is discussed among the non-verbal predicates in Chapter 9, Section 2. In the sections below, NPs are discussed according
to their modifier.","[324, 325, 326, 327]"

and nominal. Though it occurs only seldom, pronominal categories and particles can also take a predicate position. The pronominal predicates are only
in appr. 1% of all non-verbal predicate. The negative particle ďaŋku (cf. Chapter 12) appear most often as a particle in predicate position. Clauses with adjectival and nominal predicates are syntactically similar. For the distribution of
non-verbal predicate types according to their part of speech see Figure 9.1
above.

The following examples show that adjectives in predicate position do not
require a copula, but the non-verbal part of the predicate carries verbal person marking. Sentences (27a–b) show agreement marking on an adjective: in

Connegative
The connegative form appears together with negative auxiliaries and with the
auxiliary əkɨ-. This form can never occur as independent predicate. The connegative marker -Ɂ is attached to the S2 stem of the verb. It is worth noting that
the imp.2sg in the subjective conjugation is formally the same as the connegative form, thus they are morphologically homonymous. The connegative form
of the copula (isʲa) is irregular: ŋuə-Ɂ.

Auditive/Sensitive Forms
In earlier descriptions, this category was treated as a mood. However, in Nganasan this category is clearly not verbal, but nominal, and it can be adverbial as
well.6 Both forms are used to express that the speaker’s information is not firsthand, but he wants to indicate that, the information is from a sensory source,
thus this category can express a non-visual evidentiality. In this chapter only
the structure of the auditive/sensitive constructions are described. For more
detail about its usage see Section 3 in Chapter 6.
The structure of the adverbial phrase is: NP-nom + Verb-aud. The auditive/sensitive marker -mUnəɁ (-munəɁ, -mɨnəɁ) is attached to the S1 stem of
the verb. The usage of this form is illustrated by the following two sentences.

bell-pl come-aud
‘The (ringing) bells came (close to them).’
MVL_080304_TwoMeryde_flk.305The nominal structure is constructed up as follows: NP in genitive + the S1 stem
of the verb + mUnUj (-munuj, -mɨnɨj) + possessive suffix. Those forms of the
possessive suffix are used that attach to oblique cases. The -mUnUj suffix can
attach only to verbal stems. The suffix refers to the subject of the structure, and
its usage is compulsory even if the subject is overtly present in the sentence.","[290, 291, 292]"
"460chapter 142.1
Anaphora
Pronouns in subject position are not common. As mentioned above, subject
are often referred to only by a verbal ending, but the proximal demonstrative
əmtɨ ‘this’ and the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’ can stay in the subject position. Another demonstrative with the meaning ‘this’ (əmə) cannot be
used as a reference marker. It can only remain as a modifier in an NP.
The demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’ often appears after the overt NP in nonprimary role in the clause. Furthermore, it can be used as a reference marker,
if the primary participant in one of the previous clause surfaces appears as in
(10). In this case, the NP referred to is introduced in the sentences before.

with the 2sg referential possessive suffix (tətirə and əmtɨrə) can occur in the
sentence in the topic position. The proximal demonstrative əmtɨrə is used as a
referent to a previous discourse element for example in equative constructions
(11a), but it often appears in the sentence as a lexicalized discourse particle
(11b).

both the subject and the object are dropped. The verbal ending indicates both

ChNS_080302_Wife_nar.011It has been seen in Section 3.3 in Chapter 5 that it is possible to refer to an object
with the reflexive conjugation. Nganasan does not use reflexive pronouns, but
in sentence (18a) below, the reflexive suffix is bound by the phonetically not
realized pronoun sɨtɨ, which is marked with (pro) in the sentence. If there arediscourse organization463object pronouns in the sentence, the referent of the overt object and subject
pronouns cannot be the same (18b). In this case, the reflexive conjugation is
not used.

Possessive Markers in Referential Function
It is a well-known phenomenon that the Samoyedic languages use possessive
suffixes in non-possessive functions (cf. Nikolaeva 2003, Siegl 2015, Zayzon 2015
etc.). Some of the possessive suffix have a referentiality function. This use is
similar to the definite article, however it cannot be stated that the possessive suffixes are grammaticalized articles. The reason is that definiteness in
Samoyedic languages can be expressed with other means as well.
The 2sg and 3sg possessive suffixes are often used in a referential function.
There are two central heroes in example (19), the mouse and the reindeer. In
sentence (19a) the mouse is not marked, but it is definite. In sentence (19c) the
main participant is the reindeer, which was introduced by sentence (19b), this
sentence is a semantic correction to (19a). Thus, the 3sg possessive suffix on
the word ‘reindeer’ in sentence (19c) is used as a linking element (anaphoric) to
the referent, which was mentioned in the previous sentence. The same referent
appears in sentence (19d), but in this sentence, it is marked by the 2sg suffix.
The switch from 3sg to 2sg is a common strategy in folklore text to mark topic
continuity, but it appears in narrative texts as well. In sentence (19g) the mouse
is also marked by 2sgposs. This participant was not mentioned lexically in the
previous sentences, but from the situation the hearer can identify it, because it
was introduced by sentence (19a).

TKF_990816_Lemming_flkd.066The referential use of the 2sg possessive suffix is possible, if the marked NP
functions as subject of the sentence (19d), however it never occurs in another
argument position. The marker may combine with proper nouns and can also
be found on a determined noun phrase with a demonstrative təti ‘that, this’. It
must be stated that there are no examples with the other demonstrative (əmtɨ
‘this’) in this context.

PED_061023_MyAunt_nar.069As Zayzon pointed out (2015: 270), in the object position the 3sg marker is used
more often than the 2sg possessive marker. If in the sentence, both arguments,
the subject and the object are topicalized, the subject topic takes the 2sg suffix
and the object the 3sg as in (19g) above and in (21) below. However, it must be
mentioned that in most cases the 3sg often express true possessivity as well.

MVL_080225_Djajku_flkd.041The 3sg possessive marker can be used, if the referent is not mentioned in
the previous sentences, but the speaker can reconstruct it from the discourse
(associative anaphoric use). In sentence (22b) the door is marked by the pos-466chapter 14sessive suffix, but it was not mentioned earlier. However, the anchor for it can
be reconstructed.

MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.009As mentioned above, the 3sg is used, if the referent is mentioned in a previous
sentence (see sentences (19b–c) above). If the referent is not in the previous
clause, but it was introduced earlier, the 3sg can also be used (23b).
(23) a. ‘It turns out that Dyaiku has a sister. Let us bring away the girl! …’

PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.147The first person possessive marker also appears in an associative anaphoric
function. In the following sentences, the 1sg marker is used. First the trap is
marked with it. The trap was introduced, but this sentence states that the trap
belongs to the ogre. Thus, it marks a true possessive relation. In sentence (24b)
it marks the fox. It would be possible to introduce the fox without any possessive marker. In this case, the fox can be any fox. In this text, the narrator first
introduced one of the main characters of the text. After introducing the ogre,
the second protagonist, the polar fox is introduced and it is marked by the 1sg.
They two are the central heroes of the texts.

sentences later, the same referent is marked by the possessive suffix. This exercises a direct anchoring function.

ChND_061023_School_nar.0123Direct and Indirect SpeechThis section examines the describing of direct and quoted speech. Normally,
there are three participants in a speech event, the original speaker, the reporter,
and the listener. It is characteristic for folklore as well as for narrative texts that
the speakers extensively use quoted speech. However, Nganasan does not have
any quotative marker (complementizer or quotative particle), thus all quoted
speech is canonical direct speech and represents the words of the original
speaker. Quoted speech is typically introduced by an utterance predicate with
the meaning ‘say’, ‘tell’ or ‘think’. The following chart displays the speech act
verbs.","[478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486]"
"1Inferred EvidentialityOne can speak about inferred evidential information, if the speaker was not
present as the event took place, but he can infer what happened based on visual
evidence or inference. If this inference is made based upon visual evidence, this
means that he sees the result of the event. The following sentence pair shows an

can be used with all persons.

‘Board, why were you left here?’
KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.029In sentences (1a–b) the verb must be marked with the inferential, because the
mouse did not see that the woman threw the moss out and left the board there,
but he sees them lying on the tundra. Thus, his conclusion is that the moss and
the board have been abandoned. As mentioned in Section 5.8 in Chapter 5, the
inferential mood can be used in interrogative sentences without an interrogative marker, as in sentences (1a–b) above.
An additional and not rare usage of inferential is to emphasize a new element (admirative meaning). The following pair of sentences show that the
speaker indicates the source of the information only once. In sentence (2a) the
speaker uses the inferential, which means that somebody should have come. In
sentence (2b) there is no more need to use the inferential, because the speaker
has already expressed the source of the information.

surprise, thus the verb remains in the inferential.

According to our fieldwork data, a difference in the use of adjectives exists,
according to the [±human] value of the referent. Thus, two different adjectives
are to be used. It must be noted that some native speakers claim that the word
hoďəə can refer to a person as well, but others think it cannot. Similarly, some
say that sočakaʔa can also refer to a tree, but others think it cannot.

Temperature Adjectives
Nganasan adjectives expressing temperature are twofold. In one instance, the
true adjective is used, and in another, the verb’s participial form can be used as
an adjective. The list in (36) illustrates the adjectives, whereas the one in (37)
shows the participial forms. For a detailed semantic description of the temperature adjectives, see Brykina & Gusev (2015), for temperature nouns, see Section
1.7 above.

Birth, Death
For describing birth and death, a number of lexemes are available which are
not completely synonymous. In one situation, one lexeme, a basic word, is used,
while in another, an inflected form is needed. The difference in use is based on
the feature [±human].

is taken from the dictionary (Kosterkina et al. 2001)

Motion Verbs
The system of verbs describing movement is quite sophisticated. On the one
hand, verbs are differentiated according to the kind of movement, whether it
takes place on the mainland or on the water. On the other hand, the referent
plays a crucial role. Depending on its value [±human] and the fashion of moving, the correct verb is chosen. The verbs below are grouped according to their
value [±water] and [±human].
3.2.1
Movement on the Mainland
Some verbs denoting movement on the mainland can partly be used with
human subjects only, while others, with entities of any kind. Chart (40) displays the verbs sorted by the above-mentioned distribution.

3.2.2
Movement on the Water
Words expressing movement on the water (aquamotion) have been semantically analyzed by Gusev (2007b). For a more detailed description, see this work.
Again, it can be argued that the differentiation in [±human] plays a significant
role in the choice of the verb. Additionally, the value [±animal] is an issue here.
As was demonstrated by Gusev (2007b: 439), the act of swimming is not of any
importance to the Nganasan. This is partly due to the weather conditions and
to the fact that most do not know how to swim. The number of verbs used with
a [+human] entity is thus very limited. For the other two values, a semantic differentiation can be detected. The verb sɨǝďa ‘sink’ is not restricted to any kind
of subject, it can be used for all entities. The chart (42) illustrates the variation
in the use of the verb meaning ‘to swim’ according to the three different features.
(42) Verbs with meaning ‘swim’

Cooking, Feeding and Eating Terminology
As was indicated in Section 1.6 above, cooking plays a fairly insignificant role
in the Nganasan way of life. The number of cooking verbs is therefore rather
limited. The associated verbs are listed in (43).
(43) Cooking verbs
hiriďi
‘cook, boil’ [tr.]
hinsʲi
‘cook, boil’ [intr.]
hu͡atiďa ‘boil, cook’ [tr.]
hiðibtisʲi ‘bake’
munsəďa ‘boil’ [intr.]
The verbs hiriďi and hinsʲi are derivates with a bound stem hi- which cannot
occur as a separate word. The transitive verb has a non-productive transitive
suffix -Ru while intransitive verbs have a non-productive stative suffix -n. (For497lexiconmore detail on these suffixes see Section 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2 in Chapter 16.) The
two transitive verbs with the meaning ‘cook, boil’ seem to be synonymous.
Compare sentences (44b) and (44c). Both verbs can be used with the destinative. With the word ŋəmsu ‘meat, food’ both verbs can be used, but with
transferred meaning such as ‘cook the ogre’ or ‘cook the child’ only the verb
hu͡atiďa ‘boil, cook’ appears (44d).

ChND_061101_TwoTents_flkd.017Nganasan has different forms for the concepts of ‘eating’ (solid food) and ‘drinking’ (liquid). In the differentiation between the verbs the substance of the498chapter 15patient plays the decisive role. All verbs are transitive, but the patient must be
not obligatory overt. One of the verbs has special meaning, ‘eat uncooked/raw’.
The object is normally not overt, but is mentioned in the previous sentences.
It refers to fish or meat (46a). There are some derived verbs expressing ‘eating’
and ‘drinking’ which are built with the help of the denominal derivations suffix -ir attached to names of foods and drinks. (For this suffix see Section 6.3.1 in
Chapter 16). Chart (45) shows these verbs, while sentences (46a–c) give some
examples for their usage.

The verb ŋəmsaɁsa only occurs twice in the corpus, in both cases it is accompanied by an overt object in the sentence. The frequentative form (bɨðɨrsɨ) of the
verb bɨtɨďi ‘drink’ lost the general meaning ‘drink’, and now it is used with the
meaning ‘consume alcohol’. The imperfective pair of the verb ‘drink’ is formed
with the help of the iterative suffix (46d).

Temperature Verbs
There are several stative verbs denoting temperature. Stative verbs are nonderived in that many of them are marked by the translative suffix -m and have
an essive meaning. These verbs are, without exception, adjective stems, but not
all of them bear translative suffixes. The stative temperature verbs are shown
in (47), while chart (48) presents the derivates.

"chapter 6Evidentiality
This chapter discusses the possibilities for expressing evidentiality. Within
this grammar, evidentiality is considered a semantic-functional domain, which
encodes the source of information or evidence (i.e. knowledge) about which
the speaker is speaking. Nganasan contains both a grammatically marked verbal category as well as lexical expressions of evidentiality. The lexical items are
mostly particles or grammaticalized verbal forms, and they express not only
evidentiality, but also have epistemic meaning. These epistemic meanings are
not described in this chapter (for examples of lexically expressed evidentiality
see Section 8.2 in Chapter 3). Here, the focus is only on the grammatical categories of evidentiality. However, in some cases examples are given for lexical
evidentiality as well. Table 6.1 summarizes the possibilities for the encoding of
evidentiality.
According to Aikhenvald (2004), Nganasan has a three-part evidential system, in which the non-visual sensory (auditive/sensitive), inferential, and reportative categories are distinguished. It must be noted that the direct visual
sensation is unmarked. In the following sections, the evidentiality categories
are described semantically.","[293, 294]"

derivational suffix does not surface in the S1 stem, it blocks gradation—the

the nominative, while in oblique cases the trace of a consonant -j is detectable
in the paradigm, although the number marker and the case marker is inseparable in this case). (For paradigm see Section 3.)186chapter 4Abstract nouns are inflected only in the singular. The dual form refers to two
entities, while the plural refers to more than two entities. Nouns are generally
singular after numerals (for examples, see Sections 2.2 and 2.3 below).
2.1
Singular
Singular is morphologically unmarked, thus has no number marking. If the NP
has a specific referent, the singular form means that there is one of the entities
(11a). If the NP has no specific referent, the singular is used again (11b).

KBD_71_Parka_nar.0012.2
Dual
If the speaker is talking about two entities, either the dual form of the noun
or the numeral sʲiti ‘two’ is used, but the latter is normally followed by the singular form of the noun. Occasionally, the noun takes the dual marker after the
numeral: sʲiti səmu ~ sʲiti səmugəj ~ səmugəj ‘two caps’. (Regarding the agreement between the nominal phrase with a numeral complement and the predicate, see Section 1.1.1 in Chapter 10. The structure of the quantified noun phrase
is described in Section 3, Chapter 8.)
In discussing paired body parts, the dual is often used (cf. (12) below), however, in modern texts, occasionally the plural forms occur, as in sentence (14)
below in Section 2.3. The subject and the predicate must agree grammatically.

PKK_71_OneTent_flkd.033A special usage of the dual can be seen when the word meaning ‘mother’ or
‘father’ is used in the dual to mean ‘parents’. Recent sources, however, have
found examples for plural in such cases as well. Example (13a) demonstrates
the case wherein the meaning of the word ‘father’ is extended and takes onnominal inflection187the meaning ‘parent’, while example (13b) demonstrates the same for the word
‘mother’. In both cases the words are in the dual form. Examples for the plural
use see in Section 2.3.

‘bloods = a lot of blood’ (kam ‘blood’). Paired body parts are used in the plural

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.143Some words have a plural form, but refer to singular entities. They usually
denote something that is composed of several elements, for instance, a town
has many houses, and so many houses refer to a town. In such cases the word
referring to entity is pluralized:
(15) koruɁ ‘house’: koruðəɁ ‘settlement’ or ‘houses’
maɁ ‘tent’:
maðəɁ ‘nomad camp’ or ‘tents’
muŋku ‘tree’: muŋkuɁ ‘forest’ or ‘trees’
The plural carries the meaning of associative plural when used for family members. If a family member, for instance, the mother is in the plural, this does not188chapter 4mean an actual plural, but the sum total of individuals belonging to the family.
The meaning of this construction is ‘X and other (people) associated with X’.
A similar associative plural function is observable in the case of some objects
(e.g. weapons), where the plural can refer to actual plurality or associative plurality (cf. ďintə ‘bow’: ďindəɁ ‘bows’ or ‘bow and arrows’). Such forms are usually
marked with the possessive suffix which refers to real possession.

TNH_87_Seven_flks.1503Case and Its FunctionsThe case system is not very rich. In contrast to the other Northern Samoyedic
languages like Nenets and Enets, there is no essive-translative case.2 The essivetranslative meaning is expressed by a non-finite verbal construction with the
auxiliary verb konɨďi (see Section 4 in Chapter 3 and Szeverényi & Wagner-Nagy
2017a).
There is a grammaticalization process in which the lative postposition na
(cf. Section 6 in Chapter 3) takes effect and becomes a case suffix with comi2 For the Enets case system, see Siegl 2013b: 148–166, while the Nenets system is described by
Nikolaeva 2014: 60–66 and Salminen 1997.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"

Lative/Dative Coding
The basic type of the ditransitive construction is the dative construction. As
the following sentences show, if the recipient is lexically expressed in the
sentence, the theme is marked with the accusative, while the recipient, with
the lative/dative case (-ntǝ). The most usual order of constituents is A(gent)
Th(eme) R(ecipient) V(erb), but as sentences (1b–c) show, the recipient or the
theme can appear postverbally. The preverbal participant is always topicalized.
The agent is only seldom overt. Typologically, the most prototypical ditransitive
verb is misʲi ‘give’, for this reason examples with this verb are provided here.
As sentence (2) shows there are no differences between the recipient marking
with other verbs.

Postpositional Coding
There are two postpositions used in the construction: the allative postposition
ďa and the postposition na ‘to, near’. Their usage depends on the type of verb.
If the verb denotes mental transfer, i.e. it is a verb of speech (‘tell’, ‘say’ etc.)
or a verb of explication (‘show’ etc.), the recipient-like participant (addressee)
cannot be encoded with the lative/dative case, it must be expressed by a postpositional phrase with the allative postposition ďa. If the participant is a true
recipient, the verb expresses physical transfer and the postposition ďa cannot
be used. In this case, the inflected postposition na ‘to, near’ is used, marked for
case with an ancient case marker (cf. Section 4.1.2 in Chapter 3), and takes a
possessive suffix from the oblique series.
1.2.1
Mental Transfer
Three verbs of speech are used most often: munuďa ‘say’, ďebtuďa ‘tell’ and
kumunsa ‘what say/tell’. The theme is always marked with the accusative. It
remains in the nominative, if the verb takes the imperative 2sg ending, as in
sentence (3b). Pronominal agent can be expressed lexically, if it is emphasized
as in (3c), but it is most often realized as null-subject (cf. (3a)). The following
sentences show the most typical construction with mental transfer verbs.","[414, 415, 416]"

JSM_090809_Life_nar.4806PostpositionThere are no prepositions in this language, Nganasan only uses postpositions.
Postpositions can easily be distinguished from suffixes, as these are independent words which do not take part in suffix alternation and can bear stress.
The only exeption is the allative postposition ďa, which has features both of a
postposition and of a case suffix.
Postpositions are divided into two groups: postpositions with case inflection
(inflectable postpositions) and postpositions without case inflection. Postpositions with case inflection like adverbs, take special, ancient case endings (see
Section 5 above); they are inflected for local cases. The other set of postpositions lack inflection. Many of the postpositions are of nominal origin (relator
nouns); they are usually etymologically old postpositions.
Postposition are the head of postpositional phrases, it is composed of a noun
(phrase) in the genitive case and a postposition. The postposition immediately follows the noun (phrase), particles can be placed between postpositions
and the head. Postpositions cannot be modified, and they never express agreement with their objects. However, they do take possessive suffixes, e.g. ŋilʲənunə
‘under me’, huənuni ‘behind the two of us’. (More about see in Section 4.1.2
above.) Semantically postpositions are relational, spatial, or temporal.
6.1
Postpositions with Case Inflection
Postpositions take the ancient inflectional suffixes just like adverbs. For some
postpositions, the synchronic suffixes are used. Only the most frequent postpositions are listed here.
6.1.1
Spatial Postpositions
The following table summarizes the most important spatial postposition. I do
not provide examples to illustrate the use of all postpositions, only the most
important ones.","[168, 169, 170, 171]"
"1Verbal PredicationThe most common distinction between verbal predicates is their simplicity.
The verbal predicate usually is simple. Complex predicates consist of an auxiliary and a lexical verb. There are only few auxiliary verbs, one of these auxiliaries is the negation auxiliary, which serves to form standard negation and
appears most often in complex verbal predicates. Other auxiliaries are semantically not empty, but they have an additional, mostly modal meaning. In this
section, only examples for the usage of auxiliary konɨďi ‘go away’ are given. For
a detailed description of auxiliaries see Section 3.3 in Chapter 3, for negation
see Chapter 12.
The auxiliary verb konɨďi ‘go away’ appears only in essive or resultativetranslative constructions. In these constructions an NP is followed by the infinitive form (converb1) of the BE-verb (isʲa) and the conjugated form of the auxiliary. Word order variations are not allowed. Contrary to Enets and Nenets,
the infinitive/converb construction wasn’t grammaticalized as the essive case.
This form has word stress of its own, and it never undergoes cliticization. The
following examples show this construction. Not only a noun (1a), but also an
adjective (or participle), a numeral (1c) can appear as the nominal element.
(For a detailed description on essive construction see Szeverényi & WagnerNagy 2017a.)1 The converb and the infinitive are formally identical for infinitive forms see Section 6.1 in

Predicate with Subjective Conjugation
Subjective conjugation applies to all verbs. Some intransitive verbs, as ńilɨďi
‘live’, isʲa ‘be’ can be encoded only with subjective conjugation (cf. Section 3.1
in Chapter 5). Transitive verbs take a subjective suffix only in cases where the
sentence has an overt object as in the following sentence.","[353, 354]"

deaf’; ďerbajkuə ‘fat’ > ďerbajkaɁa ‘very fat’. The present participle can occur as
a base for derivation as well. The form with the augmentative suffix expresses
the permanency of the quality or characteristic. Forms derived by this can function as attributive premodifiers or predicates.

KES_080721_Disease_flkd.173The fourth augmentative suffix, -RbA1ɁA is also less frequent, e.g. hu͡alə ‘stone’
> hu͡alʲü-rbaɁa ‘huge stone’; muŋku ‘tree’ > muŋka-rbaɁa ‘tall tree’; kojkə ‘idol’
> kojkü-rbaɁa ‘big idol’. This suffix attaches to the S3 stem of a noun. The stem
noun must have a concrete referent. The suffix can also be attached to an adjective: aniɁkaa ‘big’ > aniɁka͡u-rbaɁa ‘very big’; ďüntəə ‘deaf’ > ďüntə-rbaɁa ‘rather
deaf’.
There are four diminutive suffixes, of which -A2Ɂku and -A2ŋku are more
frequent, while -Ɂku and -mA2Ɂku are quite rare. The choice between the two512chapter 16frequent diminutive suffixes -A2Ɂku and -A2ŋku is not triggered by the phonetic environment, the number of stem syllables, or by the harmonic class of
the stem. The diminutives denote a smaller version of the base or can be used to
express a pejorative meaning as well, e.g. asʲa ‘Dolgan’ > aďa-ku ‘little Dolgan’.
The derivational suffix -A2Ɂku attaches to nouns with a stem with a structure
different from CVV. The stem must have a concrete referent. The suffix deletes
the stem final vowel: horə ‘face’ > hor-aɁku ‘little face’; kolɨ ‘fish’ > kol-aɁku ‘little
fish’; səmu ‘cap’ > səm-aɁku ‘little cap’; hütəðə ‘trunk’ > hütəð-aɁku ‘little trunk’.

The structure of the stem is not CVV. The suffix deletes the stem final vowel:
konə ‘young’ > kon-aŋku ‘little young’; ďaŋur ‘tundra’ > ďaŋur-aŋku ‘little tundra’; barusʲi ‘devil’ > barusʲ-i͡aŋku ‘little devil’; maɁ ‘tent’ > mað-aŋku ‘little tent’;

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.108The -Ɂku suffix can be attached either to the S2 stem of nouns or adjectives. The
stem must have a concrete referent, and it often has the structure CVV, e.g. ńuə
‘child’ > ńuə-Ɂkü ‘little child’; ərəkərə ‘beautiful’ > ərəkərə-Ɂku ‘a bit beautiful’;
balu͡a ‘strict’ > balu͡a-Ɂku ‘a bit strict’.
The suffix -mA2Ɂku (-maɁku, -mi͡aɁku) is a complex suffix which often appears on personal names, but it can also attach to other concrete nouns. The
stem is not CVV. The second element of the suffix is the -A2Ɂku diminutive suffix (see above): ďiŋi ‘knot’ > ďiŋimi͡aɁku ‘Dingimyaku [‘little knot’]’; čenɨ ‘Cheny’
> čenɨmi͡aɁku ‘little Cheny’.
Some forms bearing augmentative or diminutive suffixes are lexicalized
forms. Earlier sources contain the lexeme təmu ‘animal’, but currently this word
in this form is no longer used. It only survives as the stem of təmuŋku ‘mouse’, in513word formation

taa: taaði͡aj ‘toy reindeer’which it is followed by the diminutive suffix. Consequently, the original meaning of this word is ‘little animal’. This is the only word in which the -Ɂku ~
-ŋku alternation can be observed. Other forms which were lexicalized with the
diminutive suffix are kǝǝlʲükü ‘short’, and ǝligaɁku ‘small’. The adjective aniɁǝ
‘big’ is formally also marked with an augmentative suffix; however, the stem
ani is no longer used at present.
The suffix -Ti͡aj (-ti͡aj, -ði͡aj) is used to derive words which signal that the concrete noun or living being functions as a plaything, e.g. taa ‘domesticated reindeer’ > taaði͡aj ‘toy reindeer’; ńuə ‘child’ > ńuəði͡aj ‘doll’; kəntə ‘sledge’ > kəntəði͡aj
‘toy sledge’; luu ‘dress’ > luuði͡aj ‘doll’s clothes’. The list in Table 16.1 summarizes
the evaluative suffixes and their morphological rules.
6.1.2
Nominalization
Nominalization is a common derivational process; there are several suffixes
that derive nominals. As can be seen below, agent, instrument, and place nouns
can be marked by the same suffixes.
6.1.2.1
Action Nouns
There is more than one suffix for the formation of action nouns. It is not absolutely clear what the exact semantic difference is between the meanings of514chapter 16these suffixes. All suffixes are deverbal. One of these suffixes is the suffix -ɁmUə
(-Ɂmuə, -Ɂmɨə), which is attached to the first or third stem of the verb, e.g. ďiə-ďi
‘give birth’ > ďiə-Ɂmɨə ‘birth’; ŋətum-sɨ ‘appear’ > ŋətumɨ-Ɂmɨə ‘birth’;4 ŋonsʲi-ďi
‘go out’ > ŋońďi-Ɂmɨə ‘going out’; basu-ďa ‘hunt’ > basu-Ɂmuə ‘hunting’. The suffix -ɁmUə can be followed by the -ďə(ə) derivational suffix. In this case, the
derivate means ‘action that happened’, as in the following sentence.

-bsʲan), just like other deverbal nouns, refer both to the act and the result of the
action. The suffix-initial -b is deleted when the suffix is attached to consonantfinal stems: bačə-ďa ‘breathe’ > bačə-bsa ‘breathing’; büü-ďa ‘go away’ > büü-bsʲa
‘walking’; kuə-ďa ‘die’ > kuə-bsa ‘death’; ďiə-ďi ‘give birth’ > ďiə-bsi͡a ‘birth’. The
following sentence shows the usage of the derivate.

SEN, 20084 Being born means to become visible. The base word is the verb ŋǝðusɨ ‘be visible’, from which
by means of the translative derivational suffix (-m, see in Section 6.3.1.1 below) the verb
ŋətumsɨ ‘appear’ can be formed, which then is further derived with the derivational suffix
of the action noun.","[528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533]"

ChND-KES_061107_Berizenaa_flkd.082It can be stated that the third person personal pronoun does not appear in
the object position, because the conjugation reflects the object, but the nonfirst personal objects are present. (For more information about the pronoun
in object position see Wratil 2013; for the usage of the objective and subjective
conjugation see Section 1 in Chapter 9.)
1.2.3
Predestinative Object
The object can be marked for predestinativity as well. In this case, the object
contains the destinative suffix (-Tə), followed by the ancient accusative ending (-m) and possessive suffix. The possessive suffix denotes the beneficiary or
recipient. If the destinative suffix takes on the theme of the ditransitive construction (direct object), as the examples below depict, the recipient or beneficiary does not obligatorily need to be expressed by lexical means, the possessive
suffix denotes it. In sentence (32a) the recipient is in the first-person singular,
and expressed by the possessive suffix (-mǝ), while in sentence (32b) it is in the
second person singular, and expressed by the possessive suffix (-rǝ).

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.0981.2.4
Direct Object in Imperative Sentences
In imperative sentences the direct object usually occurs in the nominative, if
the verb is in 2sg or 2pl imperative form. This is typical not only for Nganasan, but for some other Uralic languages as well, as Finnish or Nenets. (For
Nenets see Janhunen 2002). From the present data, in imperative sentences,
the accusative case marking is generally preserved; only the 2sg subjectivesimple sentences377forms require a nominative direct object. In the case of 2sg objective imperative there is a variation: there are examples where the object is nominative
(33b), but cases have also been found where it is marked for accusative (33c).
The sentences below illustrate the shape of the object in imperative sentences.
The selected example sentences mostly have an object with a possessive suffix,
in these cases the nominative and the accusative cases are clearly different.

Other Arguments
Adjuncts are typically adverbials expressed by adverbs, nominal categories
with an adverbial inflection or with a postposition, or rarely bar nouns such
as talu ‘yesterday, tomorrow’ (35a). Furthermore, an infinitive can also function as an adverbial of manner. Adjuncts are optional constituents of a sentence. Locality, direction movement, place of destination, starting point of
movement, path (spatial adjuncts) and temporal relation can be expressed by
adverbials, a nominal category with a case inflection (35b) or by postpositional
phrases. Time and place adverbials tend to appear in sentence or clause initial
positions (35a and 36a). If there are two adverbials in a sentence, normally the
time adverbial appears in the clause-initial position.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.232simple sentences2379Basic Sentence TypesThis section describes the typical sentence types. A statement is expressed by
a declarative sentence, a question by an interrogative and a command by an
imperative sentence.
2.1
Declarative Sentences
Declarative sentences are unmarked. They appear in narratives, in dialogues,
as well as in folklore texts. The common word order in declarative sentences is
SOV, thus the predicate is sentence-final, but the word order is not rigid. Changing the word order does not change the sentence type. As mentioned above,
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, thus the subject is not obligatory
in a sentence and under certain conditions the object can be also dropped. The
following sentences show a minimal declarative sentence.
(37) a.","[393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398]"
