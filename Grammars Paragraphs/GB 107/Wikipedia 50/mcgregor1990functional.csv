A: 'You didn't get your money the other day'l'
B: 'No, I didn't.'
(Note that, as remarked above, both mangaddi 'not', and mar/ami 'nothing,
without' may be used in replying to positive clauses, indicating the falsity of the
proposition asserted. Only mar/ami 'nothing, without' appears to occur in
response to negative polarity clauses, indicating the falsity of the embedded
(negated) proposition.)
Compare also the following, in which the polarity is negative, though the
potential mode indicates that the situation did not in fact occur:yiwindi gardyanirni
(6-139) A: thaddi
mistakenly:believed rain
it:might:have:fallen
jamoondoo
other:day
B: mar/ami
not
A: 'I thought it would rain the other day.'
B: 'No (it didn't).'
Mar/ami 'nothing, without' appears to be used in exact.ly the same way as
mangaddi 'not' in initiating a response to a request of information. It is,
however, far more frequently used in this way than is mangaddi 'not'. Example:
(6-140) A: jaji
goowa)gzna
something you:name:me
B: mar/ami nganyi -ngga ngaloowinyi goowajginya
I:call:you
not
I
ERG son
A: 'What do you call me?'
B: 'Nothing. I call you ""son"".'
In a closely related use, mariami 'nothing, without' occurs as a type of tag
by which the speaker affirms that the situation did not come to a successful
conclusion, or to its desired conclusion. The tagged clause may be either
positive (example (6-141), or negative (example (6-142).
(6-141) milalimi marlami

'I looked, but didn't find it.'","[478, 479]"
"M angaddi 'not' is also used as an interjection, as a response to both
confirmation (yes-no) and information-seeking questions. In the first case, it
indicates that the asserted proposition is false:
(6-116) A: nginyji joorloo ngoorloogjimi

B: mangaddi nganyi mar/ami ngoodtkxJ -yarndi.

ERG they:drank:it
A: 'You drank with them?'
B: 'No, not me. That other lot (only) drank.'
It seems that mangaddi 'not' is used in this way only in indicating the falsity of
a preceding positive assertion. Otherwise, marlami 'nothing, without' invariably
occurs if the preceding assertion is negative (see next section).
The occurrence of mangaddi 'not' in responses to information probes is
rather unexpected to the English speaker. An example of this use is the
following:(6-117) A: yinigaanggiddaddi
you:pl:are:doing:something
B: mangaddi maa ngabgidda
not
meat we:eat:it
A: 'What are you doing?'
B: 'No( thing), we're eating meat.'",[473]
"Cl.AUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS493But marlami 'nothing, without' is not always used in such a qualifying
sense; it may also be used evaluative1y. That is, the entity involved may be
evaluated as nothing, or worthless, rather than as non-existent. For example,doorloo yijgawoo
(6-131) marlami jijagbi
not
he:will:talk heart
OOd
'He'll tell you nothing; his heart is no good.'
allows that the individual concerned may talk, but only a little (and not well),
because of his bad heart, and consequent weakness.
Mar/ami 'nothing, without' is also occasionally found in VPs. as (a part
ot) the Process - see examples (3-1 04) and (3-1 05) above.
(ii) There are other occurrences in which marlami 'nothing, without' cannot
be viewed as a phrasal constituent. For example, in the following two examples
there is no NP containing mar/ami 'nothing, without'.
(6-132) marlami wardbi
not
he:will:go
'He can't walk.'
(6-133) marlami wardjiddi
not
we:went
We didn't go.'
It is suggested that in such examples marlami 'nothing, without' realises acircumstantial role of time or place, translating 'never' (or 'at no time') in
(6-132), and 'nowhere' (or 'to no place') in (6-133).
At present this possibility remains hypothetical. It might be remarked that
unlike mangaddi 'not', marlami 'nothing, without' does not focus on a following
element, nor is there a presupposition that a related process applies to some
other entity (or whatever) in contrast to the focal one.
(6-134) garndiwangooddoo marlami nganyi milaabidda
I

'They don't see me.'
Secondly, the force of the negation seems to be more 'generalised' than is
the case for mangaddi 'not'. That is, it indicates that the situation held for no
time, place or entity (within presumed limits) -as in the previous example.
Thirdly, and related to the first point, there is no evidence that marlami
'nothing, without' modalises the proposition as does mangaddi 'not'. As was
suggested above (section 5.4.1), clauses negated by mangaddi 'not' occur inTOPICS 1N sEMANTICS494contradiction to the presuppositions and expectations of the speech-situation.
And clauses that correlate with them invariably supply the positive counterpart.
namely, what did happen. (See examples (5-216), (5-370) and (5-371).) But
clauses negated with mar/ami 'nothing, without' do not seem to invoke such
relations to the expectations of the speech situation, and they do not appear to
contradict implicit presumptions of the truth value of the proposition. This
shows up in the type of clause that correlates with the mar/ami 'nothing,
without' clause: it never indicates what DID happen2 , but always provides an
enhancing comment. Some illustrative examples are:
(6-135) wajbali
mar/ami bijngarni
ngoonyi

this
'I didn't see him. He wasn't there.'-ya

LOC he:sat(iii) Mar/ami 'nothing, without' may also occur as an interjection- i.e. as
a minor clause by itself. Like mangaddi 'not', it occurs initially in responses torequests for confirmation/disconfirmation, and in responses to requests for
information. In the former case, mar/ami 'nothing. without' indicates the correct
polarity for the preceding clause. It does not affirm or deny the proposition
asserted by that clause, as does ngajirta 'not', the negative particle in Walmajarri
-see Hudson and Richards (1978:101). Thus:
(6-137) A: gaddwaroo bijngarni
afternoon he:emerged
B: mar/ami jamoondoo bijngarninot

"488TOPICS IN SEMANI'ICS6.4 Clause modifying particles and adverbials
6.4.1 mangaddi 'not'
This Iexeme is a negative particle which usually has the role of Propositional
Modifier, and indicates that the proposition in its scope is false. It may perhaps
be most accurately glossed 'it is not the case that' - in preference to 'not',
which is a VP constituent in English. (However, for convenience, I will use the
label 'not' in glossing the morpheme, under the understanding that this is an
abbreviation for the longer expression.) The modified proposition may be in any
tense or mood category. (In this respect Gooniyandi differs from many languages
of the Kimberleys, including Ungarinyin (Rumsey 1982b:89), Nyikina (Stokes
1982:280), Nyulnyul (my own fieldnotes), and Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:85) at
least, in which the negative particle occurs with unreal (irrealis and occasionally
negative) modes only.) The meanings of the combinations of mangaddi 'not'
with the various verbal categories are predictable, and will be mentioned at the
relevant points in the discussion of the verbal categories in section 6.5 below.
The word order generalisations made above (section 5.4.1) apply to
mangaddi 'not'. The only thing that needs to be added on this is that occasionally
two instances of mangaddi 'not' are found in a single clause, as illustrated in the
following two examples. (There are no examples of this phenomenon for other
particles.)

It remains unclear just what sense mangaddi 'not' conveys here. In both
circumstances outlined above, mar/ami 'nothing, without' (see discussion of next
section) occurs far more frequently than does mangaddi 'not'.
6.4.2 marlami 'nothing, without'
Gooniyandi has another word for expressing negation, mar/ami 'nothing,
without', which indicates that no entity, time, or place is involved in the referent
situation. It corresponds to the English words 'no', 'nothing'. 'nowhere', and
'never', and is frequently glossed najing (from standard English nothing) in
Pidgin English and Kriol. As distinct from mangaddi 'not', mar/ami 'nothing,
without' never functions as a Propositional Modifier. Rather, it negates an entity
or circumstance, and from this the clause itself may gain negative force, as
happens with the English words nothing, nowhere, and so on.
Mar/ami 'nothing, without' has three main contexts of occurrence, which
are not always distinguishable: (i) it may realise a phrasal role; (ii) it may realise
a clausal circumstantial role of time or place; or (iii) it may be used as an
interjection.
(i) I will first deal with the case in which mar/ami 'nothing, without'
fulfils a modifying role in an NP. There are two main possibilities: it may
precede or follow the Entity nominal. The relative order is significant, and finds
clearest explanation in terms of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent
modification and reference modification, discussed above (see page 267). In
addition, the phrase in which it occurs may function either attributively, within
another phrase (i.e. as a Qualifier or Classifier) or clause, or referentially.
In the first case, the phrase attributes of an entity the property of being
without something, as discussed in section 5.2.3.5 above. The usual word order
is for mar/ami 'nothing, without' to follow the Entity nominal, as exemplified
in e.g. (4-36) and (4-79). Only rarely does it precede the Entity nominal, as in
(6-119) nginyji binaddi nganyi marlami
you
know I
not
'(As) you know, I have no car.'moodiga
motorcarIn referential phrases marlami 'nothing, without' typically precedes theCLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBJALS491Entity, and indicates that nothing of the type referred to by the Entity nominal
was involved in the referent situation. In this circumstance marlami 'nothing,
without' clearly modifies the reference of the phrase. For example,
(6-120) mar/ami gamba ngambiddi baali -ya
not
water again
road LOC
'There's no water again on the road.'
(6-121) marlami banda doowwidtkl
not
ground they:got:it
'They got no dirt.'
Note: (6-120) and (6-121) may be contrasted with sentences such as (5-258) and
(5-259) in which mangaddi 'not' occurs in the same place in the clause. There is a
sharp distinction in meaning. With marlami 'nothing, without'. there is no focus
on the following element, and no presupposition that the predicate holds true of
anything (although it may).","[473, 474, 475]"

'I won't lie on my back (it's sore).'
It could be for any number of other reasons; all that is stated is that the situation
is not going to occur.
An English sentence such as 'I can't walk' has two possible translations into
Gooniyandi: mangaddi wardngiri (not I:go), and mangaddi wardbingi (not
I:will:go). The former indicates (in this context) that I do not have the general
characteristic - that is, I do not walk at all; the second, that I will not walk in
the immediate future - due to some temporary disability. (The two Gooniyandi
clauses have, of course, a wide range of other senses, having nothing to do with
ability.)The future tense projects into future time with respect to the speech
situation, or with respect to a reported speech situation. There is one
counterexample in the corpus, in which the reference point is a referent event
which is not one of speech:
(6-222) gamba -rni jaayi -nhi

LOC it:will:lie
'Then water lay in his hole. This was bad and the dog wouldn't liethere.t
(Note: this utterance occurred in a constructed narrative, and not in describingcurrently relevant goings-on.)
(b) Proposals. The unmarked mode of expressing a command to do
something is by a clause with the future tense. For example,522TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(6-223) thithi wardbiri
going you:will:go
1
Goaway!'
Other examples include (5-366) and (5-371). Commands to continue doing
something are also expressed through the future tense, frequently in conjunction
with a temporal adverbial such as wamba 'later'. Examples:
(6-224) bagiwiri
ngirndaji -ya
nganyi bagingiri lilingganyi
you:will:lie this
LOC I
I:will:lie westside
'You remain there, I'll lie on the west side.1
(6-225) wamba goorijba
later
you:will:hold:it
'Keep holding it1
Commands need not have a second person actor. Most non-second person
commands require that the addressee not intervene in an ongoing process; they do
not normally request positive action from him/her. (The positive action would
usually be explicitly indicated in a separate clause with second person actor.) An
example is(6-226) wamba bagiwi
later
he:will:lie
'Let him lie (don't get him up).'
With a frrst person inclusive actor, the proposal may have the effect of a first
person command. This sense usually occurs in conjunction with the interjection
ba 'come on, lets go':
(6-227) In
come:on we:will:go
'Come on, lets go.'
See also line (32) of Text 1.
Negative commands - that is, commands not to do somethingt or to stop
doing something - are not as a rule expressed by negating a clause in the future
tense. Instead, they are usually realised by the negation of a clause in the definite
present (see section 6.5.3.? for details). There are just a few instances in the
corpus in which a negated future clause expresses a command-VERBAL CATEGORIES523(6-228) mangaddi wardbiri
warangbiri
not
you:will:go you:will:sit
'Don't go, sit.'
(6-229) mangaddi migama
-ngaddagi
not
you:will:say to:me
'Don't tell me (that word).'
It remains unclear in what respects the two possibilities differ in meaning, and
native speakers claimed both modes of expression meant the same thing.
In addition to expressing commands, the future may be used in offers, as in
(6-230) nya ngoorloogba
here you:will:drink:it
'Here, have a drink.'
and in granting permission- see e.g. line (52) of Text 1.
One further use of the future tense in proposals must be mentioned. It is
used in offering advice to the addressee as to how s/he might go about doing
something. For example,
(6-231) A: yiniga
ngawa/i
ngaragba
somehow spear:thrower you:make:it
B: miga
ngaragba
this:way you:make:it
A: 'How do you make a spear?'
B: 'Like this.'","[501, 502, 503, 504]"
"In contrast to the irrealis potential, there is no suggestion in (6-303) that the
speaker tried, or made any move towards eating the food, and no suggestion in
(6..304) that any attempt or move towards effecting the action was made.
As is the case for negated irrealis potential clauses - and for the same
reasons - a negated irrealis subjunctive clause is consistent with both the
occurrence and the non-occurrence of the situation. There are no examples of the
irrealis subjunctive in negated independent clauses where the situation occurred
- but cf. example (5-398). But when the situation did not occur, the negation
of the irrealis subjunctive strengthens the negative sense, indicating that not
only did the process not occur, but it could not, or would not occm: the speaker
holds it as a virtual impossibility. In effect, it is denied that the occurrence of
the situation is entertained or suggested, or that the actor wanted to do it. The
following examples illustrate the latter, experiential sense:(6-305) mangaddi gard -ja
-alooni
not
hit SUBJ IRR+(lsg)N+BINI
'I wouldn't hit him.' (I had no intention of doing so.)550TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(6-306) mangaddi dirib -ja
-ayoondi
yoowayi

enter SUBJ IRR+BINDI he:was:afraid
'He wouldn't go in; he was scared.' (He didn't entertain the notion
of going inside.)
Contrast the typical senses of the negative irrealis potential - see section
6.5.3.2 above.
There is one example available where the interpersonal sense is denied: that
is the speaker denies that the proposition could be claimed, entertained, believed,
or whatever. It is:(6-307) mangaddi waj
..p -awaddi
wamba -nyali goorijga
not
throw SUBJ IRR+ADDI later
REP he:holds:it
'He can't have thrown it away (because) he's still got it'
(Note the English gloss involves the internal sense of because- see Halliday
and Hasan 1976:257.)
[3] Past subjunctive. The subjunctive occprs far less frequently in
independent clauses in real tenses, i.e. past and present, and it is impossible to
be sure of the meaning intended. However, the present framework provides for
reasonable interpretations of the examples available. With the real tenses nonindicative carries the force of 'allegedly'. Both the interpersonal uses, in which
the speaker alleges or reckons that the situation occurred, and the experiential
uses, in which someone else (usually the actor) alleges, or is in a position to
allege that the situation occurred, occur. By 11 allege"" it is meant that the
speaker/actor attests to the validity of the proposition in his/her opinion or
estimation. This allows that s/he may be mistaken, and the situation did not
occur.
(a) Interpersonal. A typical example involving the interpersonal sense of
the past subjunctive in an independent clause is (6-308). This comes from a text
in which a police posse come across the recently vacated dinner-camp of a group
of Aborigines they were following. The head tracker asserts (to the policemen):(6-308) ngab -ja
-widda
ngamoo -nyali
eat
SUBJ (3pl)N+A before
REP
'They were eating here not long ago.'
By using the subjunctive here the speaker indicates that the proposition that they
had eaten there recently was determined by circumstantial evidence~ and that s/he
is not prepared to assert unreservedly to the proposition as a fact. Presumably
there is, or may be, some uncertainty as to whether or not the situation occurred.","[530, 531]"
"'Don't come at dawn.'
It is probable that, as in non-standard English, the two negatives intensify the
force of the negation.
Mangaddi 'not' occurs in two other contexts. Instead of modifying a full
proposition, mangaddi 'not' sometimes appears to modify a single word referring
to a scalable quality or quantity, as in
(6-115) wardbiddi mangaddi mamangooddoo grw.
they:went not
fur
close
They went only a little distance away.'",[472]
"VERBAL CATEGORIES543(As above, the negative command involves the negation of a 'strong' possibility
(that the situation will occur), not the evaluation of the situation as nonoccurring.)These uses of the present definite may be explained in terms of the analysis
of the present tense presented in section 6.5.1.5. Roughly, in using the defmite
mode in combination with the present tense the speaker evaluates the occurrence
of the situation as definite or certain, on the basis of factual evidence of the
surrounding conditions, etc .. However, s/he does not assert a particular temporal
or realisation value for it - s/he does not assert it to be anterior or posterior to
the present time, nor realised or unrealised as of the time of the speech situation.
The main possibilities, as outlined for the present tense (section 6.5.1.2), occur
also with the present definite: present time, which appears to occur in
exclamations only; future time, in all three speech act types, referring to
imminent occurrences; generic, in assertions (see example (6-289)); and
hypothetical, in conditional constructions (example (6-281)).
In accordance with a general principle that the speaker will normally make
the strongest assertion consistent with the facts as s/he understands them, the
speaker uses the present definite only if s/he believes the process not to be both
realised (i.e. [-unrealised]) and [+anterior]- in which case past tense would be
used; or [+unrealised] and [-anterior] - in which case the future tense would be
used. In other words, use of the present definite is nonnally concurrent with the
speaker's belief that the process has not yet occurred (in which case it would
belong to the past), and that it is not a projection into the future. This explains
why, as remarked in section 5.6.2.1.3, the apprehensional construction does not
occur if the situation against which the avoidance action was taken did in fact
occur. If, however, the situation to be avoided did not occur in the past, the
present definite clause may refer to it, the present tense being marked as
[~anterior].","[523, 524]"
"As is the case for positive commands, the negative command need not have
a second person Actor. These usually have a sense 'don't let' or 'don't allow',
requesting that the hearer try to prevent the event from occurring. For example,
(6-287) mangaddi maa ngabga -woo
not
meat he:eats:it DEF
'Don't let him eat the meat.'",[523]
"..
PRONOMINALS1673.6 Pronominals
The category of person is realised in a number of different places and ways in the
grammar of Gooniyandi. Within the VP it is realised by bound morphemes,
which occur either as prefixes to the classifier complex, or as enclitics to the
entire verb phrase (see section 3.9.3.6). Elsewhere, it is realised by free words,
and in a set of two possessive suffixes to kin-tenus (see section 3.12.2.1). With
two minor exceptions (see pages 225 and 234 below) the system is constant
throughout, distinguishing three persons (first, second and third), two numbers
(singular and non-singular) and what I will refer to as a restricted/unrestricted
opposition in the first person non-singular.
The restricted category in the first person non-singular encompasses the
traditional categories of first person dual inclusive, dual exclusive, and plural
exclusive, whilst the unrestricted category corresponds to the first person plural
inclusive. In other words, the inclusive/exclusive distinction is maintained only
in the plural; it disappears in the dual. The unrestricted category always includes
the speaker, the hearer, and at least one other person; the restricted category
excludes one of the non-speakers. Using the symbolism S =speaker, H = hearer,
and 0 = other(s), and assuming that S and H can refer to a single individual
only, while 0 may refer to any number of others, the restricted and unrestricted
categories may be distinguished as follows:
Restricted
UnrestrictedsH0+
+a-a++where a can be either+ or-, -a having the reverse polarity. Equivalently, we
could describe the restricted category as S & (H v 0), where 'v' signifies
disjunctive or; and the unrestricted category as S & H & 0.
To the best of my knowledge, pronominal systems resembling the Gooniyandi
one have not been reported in any other language, from Australia or elsewhere.
Among the neighbouring languages, those from the Pama-Nyungan family which includes Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:85), Jaru (Tsunoda 1981:64ff), and
Wangkajunga (my own fieldnotes)- and the Worrorran family- e.g. Ungarinyin
(Rumsey 1982b:31) - make the usual inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first
person non-singular. In the Jarrakan languages Kija (my fieldnotes) and
Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:47), this distinction is at least optional. However, all of
the languages of the Nyulnyulan family (traditionally located to the west of
Gooniyandi and Bunuba) show a quite different system, which distinguishes four
persons 1, 1/2, 2, and 3, and, depending on the language, two or three numbers,
minimal, augmented and, where three numbers are distinguished, unit augmented
(Stokes 1982:151ff).","[151, 152]"
"(A-ii) The situation would not have occurred had some other situation536TOPICS IN SEMANTICSoccurred. This is a counterfactual, the negative of sense (vi) above. See example

not have occurred. For example,

DAT
'He needn't talk to his mother like that'(B) In case the situation did not occur, the negation of the potential has the
effect of indicating that, not only didn't the situation occur, but it was not
expected to occur. The main contextualisations are:
(B-i) The Actor did not even try to do the action, which did not occur. For
example,•(6-260) mangaddi doowyarni

'No, I'm looking for a camp.' (Answer to What are you doing?')(There are no examples of woomoorla 'not, without' used as a Propositional

It remains unclear whether or not woomoorla 'not, without' is an avoidance
equivalent of both mangaddi 'not' and marlami 'nothing, without'. It certainly
seems to cover the range of senses of mar/ami 'nothing, without' - but it is not
clear whether in its apparent role of negating clauses (as in example (6-145)) it
realises the role of Propositional Modifier, or some circumstantial role. That
mangaddi 'not' itself occurs in avoidance style utterances and mar/ami 'nothing,
without' does not, perhaps suggests that woomoorla 'not, without' is an
equivalent of marlami 'nothing, without' only.","[479, 480]"
"525VERBAL CATEGORIESFigure 6-2: Matrix analysis of the Gooniyandi tense system
+anterior-anterior-unrealisedpastpresent+unrealisedirrealis·futureThe proposed feature systems discriminate between the tenses in a
semantically revealing way. Furthermore, I claim that the feature values of
Figures 6-1 and 6-2 constitute the total formal meaning of the tense categories.
All of the other meanings discussed above (in sections 6.5.1.1 to 6.5.1.4) are
contextualisations of these formal meanings. For example, the sense of certainty
and temporal proximity carried by the future (see section 6.5.1.3 above) is a
contextual meaning. In combinations with the potential mode and subjunctive
mood, these connotations do not exist (and so they cannot be part of the formal
meaning of the category).
It is clear from these diagrams, and the preceding discussion, that the tense
system conflates modal type meanings with purely temporal meanings (as does
the English system- see e.g. Kress and Hodge 1979). The first system might
be labeled time, the second, realisation or mood. The time sub-system is thus
equatable with the common past/non-past found in many languages. In this subsystem, past and irrealis are grouped together as happening before the now of
speech time, while present and future are specified as not belonging to the realm
of the past. There is a linguistic correlate of this grouping of past and irrealis
against present and future: the particle thaddi 'mistakenly believe' occurs with the
past and irrealis tenses only.
The second system, moodt groups together the irrealis and future against
the present and past. The former pair are specified as unrealised (they did not
occur), while the latter pair are specified as not unrealised. (The reason for this
choice of terms over the perhaps more natural [±realised] relates ·to markedness:
it is clear that irrealis and future are relatively marked with respect to past and
present.) A morphological correlate of this binary opposition is that only the
irrealis and future occur with the potential mode, and only past and present occur
with factive mood.
The contextual senses of [+anterior] and [..anterior] require no comment
beyond the observation that the time may be either the time of speaking (which526TOPICS IN SEMANTICSit usually is), or a point of time established in the referent reality, usually the
time of a referent speech event. As we have already seen, the present and future
tenses may occur in reference to past events (note however that there is no
evidence that the present is used to give immediacy to narrated events in the
past, as is the case in English). However, the process in present or future tense
is always clearly specified as not anterior to a point of time in the referent reality
- typically it is a point of time established as the time of a referent speech act.
The term [-unrealised] is meant to capture the fact that the past and present
tenses are used both in reference to specific and individual processes - that is,
processes which occurred once, at some point in time, or during some particular
period of time - and also to processes which occurred more than once, either
habitually, as a characteristic of a particular participant, or generically, as a
general characterising quality. In any event, the process occurred at least once, or
is presented as having occurred at least once. Both past and present tenses are
used in reference to hypothetical events - for instance, the past tense was used
in a text to describe events that may have occurred in the past, before the arrival
of whites, these events being presented as general characteristics of the earlier
time. What is important here is that the events are PRESENTED BY the speaker
as realised, or potentially realisable. They are evaluated as realised - as events
that could have, and/or did happen. Such hypothetical events are ones which
could have happened. By contrast, events which are hypothetical for irrealis and
future tense are counterfactual hypotheticals - that is, the unrealised event
definitely did not occur or has not yet occurred.
Processes specified as [+unrealised] did not occur, or have not yet occurred;
it is always the case that a specific process is under consideration, never a
generic or habitual one. That is, an event was not realised at a specific point in
time. It is not indicated that the whole of a generic class of events were not
realised (this meaning is expressed with the negation of past or present tensed
clauses).
Now a clause in a [+unrealised] tense may be asserted, that is, the speaker
may merely state that the process did not occur in the past, or that it has not yet
occurred, as of the time of speech; this gives the contextual senses of
counterfactual hypotheticals, and potentialities, for the irrealis, and of future
hypotheticals, predictions, and so on for the future tense. Clauses in the
[+unrealised] tenses may also be used in proposals -that is, they may be used
in order to get someone to do something (see section 5.4, and Halliday 1985:71)
- as well as assertions. Uttering a clause which specifies that the process is not
realised may be used with the effect of indicating that it should have, or shouldVERBAL CATEGORIES527occur. This gives rise to the contextualisations of admonishments for the
irrealis, and of commands, exclamations, and so on for the future. (That the
future is used in commands to continue to do something does not necessarily
contradict any of the above claims. Here the speaker is choosing as his/her
temporal reference point some future time at which s/he is assuming that the
process is not occurring: that is, s/he is supposing that the event which is
presently occurring will not be occurring at some point of time in the future.
Thus, it might be suggested that there is a felicity condition (see e.g. Lyons
1977:733) whereby commands to continue are appropriate only where there is a
presupposition that the process will cease.)
Clauses in the present tense are also used in proposals. This occurs only in
the definite mode, which is realised by the verbal enclitic -woo DEF, and only in
negative commands. This contextual sense may be accounted for, I claim, in
terms of the two features of the present: [-anterior], and [-unrealised].
Specifically, by negating the proposition that the process is occurring now or
will occur later, and that it is not unrealised, the speaker is suggesting that the
process will not occur in the near future (in this speech-context). In the
circumstances of the utterance, this amounts to a strong suggestion that the
event should not occur, and that the hearer should not do it.
The above remarks indicate, in outline, how the many uses of the
Gooniyandi tenses may be accounted for.as contextualisations of unique formal
meanings.","[505, 506, 507, 508]"
"IQ[thaddi6.4.5 yiganyi 'uncertain'
Depending on context, yiganyi occurs in two apparently distinct senses. As a
Propositional Modifier it indicates possibility, and is normally glossed maydbi
in the local varieties of Kriol or Aboriginal English. Secondly, it occurs as a
circumstance of Manner, in which case it usually indicates that the action was
done sneakingly. In this usage it is usually glossedjineg (from English sneak)
by native speakers of Gooniyandi. A single formal meaning is postulated,
'uncertain', to account for these two apparently distinct contextual senses. (Cf.
Rumsey 1982b:172-176.)
As a Propositional Modifier, yiganyi indicates an attitude of uncertainty of
the speaker towards the proposition s/he is uttering. As a circumstance of
Manner, this word indicates that the actor performed the action in an uncertain
manner: gfhe was in a condition of uncertainty as s/he did it. That is, the modal
particle yiganyi 'uncertain' has both interpersonal and experiential uses: it may
indicate either a subjective attitude within the speech situation, or a subjective
attitude in the thesis, the events described - that is, in the mind of the actor. I
will examine these two senses in turn, adducing evidence in support of the
postulated formal meaning.
Firstly, in its role as a Propositional Modifier, yiganyi 'uncertain' appears
never to be used in drawing inferences from the observed to the hypothetical.
Rather, it expresses the fact that the speaker just does not have the appropriate
backing to allow him/her to make a definite assertion. If ever an enhancing
clause is added to explain why the speaker does not make a plain unmodalised
statement, it always explains that the speaker did not see, hear or otherwise
perceive that the event did or did not take place -see example (5-346). It never
provides evidence suggesting the occurrence of the event to be likely; there are
no examples of the type, familiar to the speaker of English. illustrated by He
might have taken it, (likely) because I saw him there. That is, yiganyi
'uncertain' does not comment on the likelihood of the occurrence of the situation
referred to, given the speaker's knowledge of the relevant facts: the proposition is
not evaluated as either likely or unlikely. Thus yiganyi 'uncertain' occurred in
.elicited Gooniyandi equivalents for English sentences involving both maybe and
maybe not (in which the proposition is evaluated either as more or less likely),
depending on context. The first sense typically occurs in case the embedded'500TOPICS IN SEMANTICSproposition expresses something 'greater than' the expectation of the speaker, in
the sense invoked in sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.5 above. For example (6-153) was
given as an utterance I might make to the speaker, telling him that I might
come to see him one night.
(6-153) yiganyi maningga wardjawingi
uncertain night
I:might:come
'Maybe I'll come one night.'
The sense of unlikeliness is suggested by the fact that otherwise the utterance
would be pointless: I had never visited him before at night, and there was no
expectation that I would start doing so.
On the other hand, the sense 'maybe not' may be suggested if the
expectation is greater in some sense than the embedded proposition. For
example, the sentence
(6-154) yiganyi sergeant -ga
lVardba
-ngadda
uncertain
ERG he:will:bring:it for:me
'I'm unsure that the sergeant will bring (my uniform). •
was given in response to the English prompt 'Maybe I won't get my uniform
this year'. This was elicited at a time when the speaker was becoming
increasingly convinced that the authorities had forgotten him, and would not
bring him his new police uniform for the Fitzroy Crossing races.
The point is that yiganyi 'uncertain' does not itself evaluate the proposition
as likely or unlikely. But as elsewhere, the fact that the proposition has been
modalised at all conveys meaning -basically it counters an expectation or
presupposition, and the nature of this presupposition suggests either the 'likely'
or 'unlikely' interpretation of yiganyi.
The above points are clearly illustrated in example (5-364) which also
contains an embedded negative proposition. This utterance was used to describe a
situation in which a bustard was hit by a Landrover as it was flying up off the
road; the bird flew uncertainly off. As far as the speaker knew, the bird did not
fall (and had not fallen since): this is expressed in the second embedded clause
mangaddi gardgoonaani 'it isn't falling' which is modified by yiganyi 'uncertain',
indicating the speaker's lack of knowledge. At the same time it suggests an
evaluation that it is likely that the bird fell- or otherwise a more neutral mode
of expression, such as for example mangaddi gardbani 'it didn't fall (then)', would
have been chosen. And here 'not falling' is clearly evaluated as greater than
'falling', just as is 'breaking its leg' is greater than 'not breaking its leg'. YiganyiCLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS501'uncertain' can itself indicate neither an evaluation of likelihood, nor a purely
objective viewpoint, that the proposition is purely 'possible' .4 I cannot see how
these senses can be explained unless yiganyi indicates the speaker's attitude of
uncertainty.
It seems that yiganyi expresses the same sort of uncertainty as does the enclitic
-widdi UNK.N (see section 6.3.6), which is restricted to occurring on nominals and
indicates that the speaker is unsure of the referent. And in each instance the
expression of lack of certainty is not normally used if information is being
sought from the hearer.","[483, 484, 485]"
"Utterances such as these are in a sense intermediate between assertions and
proposals, and contain features of each: infonnation is exchanged, but it is also
expected to be acted upon. (Note that in Aboriginal Australia in general, it
seems that instruction on how to do something was and is normally given by
way of example, not by a description of procedures- see e.g. Harris 1984 and
Christie 1985.)
(c) Exclamations. The plain future- but again, not the plain past or
present tenses in the available data - sometimes occurs in exclamations,
normally of the expletive type. An example is:
(6-232) banyangi wardbi
thithi
outside
he:will:go going
""Let him go to fucking hell!"" (speaker's gloss)
(Contrast the exclamations mentioned in section 6.5.3.3 below.)TOPICS lN SEMANTICS5246.5.1.4 Irrealis tense
The irrealis tense does not have the privilege of independent occurrence: it must
occur with either the potential mode (for discussion of this combination see
section 6.5.3.2) or the subjunctive mood (this combination is discussed in
section 6~5.4.1). In both cases it specifies the unreal status of the siwation at a
past time.
Many languages of the Kimberley region - including Ungarinyin (Rumsey
1982b:89ff), Nyikina (Stokes 1982:276ff), Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:182), and
apparently Walmajarri (cf. Hudson 1978:77ff- Hudson does not however treat
the opposition as one of mood), but not :Bunuba (Rumsey pers.comm.) - have an
opposition of realis vs. irrealis MOOD. Significantly, in all of these languages
only the irrealis occurs in negative clauses (see the references cited above, and
page 488 above). This does not of course hold true of Gooniyandi.","[504, 505]"
"What is involved in this type of threat is that unless the addressee modifies
his/her behaviour appropriately, an undesirable (for him/her) consequence will
ensue. A clause may occur expressing the type of action that the addressee
should take to avoid this consequence. The resulting sentence is then a lest type~
used as a proposal.
In case the addressee is an undergoer and the Actor is a third person~ it will
probably be a warning to him or her:(6-284) moodiga milawa
ngzny}l -rni. gilangginggaddoo -woo
car
you:will:see:it you
SEQ it:knocks:you
DEF
Watch out or the car will knock you.'
Finally, in case the Actor is a third person, and the clause does not involve the
addressee, as in (6-275), the purpose may be to elicit intervention from the
hearer- in this case, to help the person out of the water.
In proposals, the present definite most frequently occurs in negated clauses
functioning as negative commands - commands to desist from doing, and
commands not to do. For example,
(6-285) mangaddi goomboorna bijginyjarnoo -woo
not
early
you:come
DEF'Don't come early.'
(6-286) wilawoo gadboo
wayandi mangaddi gajginyja -woo

you:will:leave:it fire
not
you:cut:it DEF
'Enough. Stop. Don't cut any more frrewood.'",[523]
"DATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION33Very early in the course of the fieldwork I became aware of problems
inherent in the standard field procedure of eliciting responses to clccontcxtualisz~d
English sentences. It was frequently the case that speakers would, on different
occasions give three or four distinct translation equivalents to a single English
prompt. This problem was particularly bothersome in dealing with categories
which express the speakers' viewpoint and evaluation of the proposition. For
example, a single English verbal category such a'> future tense, which, as is well
known, expresses modal as well as temporal meaning, might emerge as any om~
of three or four Gooniyandi verbal categories (sec section 6.5. 1.3). 'I11c difficulty
is that evaluative meanings such as these arc not as readily accessible tu the
linguist as are the representational or content meanings -- that is, cxrx~ricntial
meaning in Halliday's (e.g. 1970, 1985) terms. It is as a rule easier lO dclcrminc
whether or not the linguist and the native speaker have matching
conceptualisations of the situation described by the English prompt than it is to
determine (out of context) whether they coincide in their perceptions of the
viewpoints and evaluations expressed.
It was clear that in the majority of cases native speakers did not perceive
equivalences, or even unmarkecl correlations between grammatical cmegorics of
English and Gooniyandi. They did not translate prompt sentences category by
category; they appeared to regard translation as a semantic procedure, mther than
a formal operation on strings of linguistic symbols. I could detect no tendency
for speakers to invent calques on English constructions, which, likl~ 'to want'
complement clauses, are expressed by means of totally different categories ami
constructions in Gooniyandi (cf. Heath 1984:582). In seeking a translation for
an English prompt,6 it seemed that the Gooniyandi speaker first imagined some
context in which the English sentence might be uttered, and then found n
suitable Gooniyandi sentence which would have roughly t11c surnc sense in 1hat
context. The problem was that I had no access to the imagined context As a
consequence, it was necessary to modify my method of elicitation so as to
circumscribe, and gain some control of the conteXL'>. This was dnne by verbally
constructing imaginary and real scenarios, especially ones of which both
participants (Gooniyandi speaker and linguist) had some knowkdge. I would
request utterances appropriate Lo describing t11cse situations, and uttcmnccs whit:h
6 This is an oversimplification. In most cases the Gooniyandi speaker did not
speak Standard Australian English, and there was no certainty that s/hc put the
srune values to the categories as I did. Nor could misunderstandings he entirely
eliminated by my using Kriol or Pidgin (of which I claim little speaking contml)
as the prompting language.","[45, 46]"
"And in negative clauses, the written English translation normally employs
'either' (though the spoken variant can employ 'too'); it is clear that exactly the
same sense of the enclitic is involved. For example:
(6-89) nganyi -ngaddaya marlami diribbingiI
TOO
nothing I:will:go:in
'I can't go in either.' (Literally: 'Me too, I can't go in.')
When it occurs in this sense, -ngaddaya TOO normally occurs on the
initial word of the clause, this word also being the marked information focus of
the clause (see section 5.3.1). This means that what follows is given
information, which is marked as presupposed. (6-87), for instance, occurred in a
context in which it was well known that an epidemic of the 'flu was going
around. That is, -ngaddaya TOO is used when there is a presupposition that a
similar situation involving at least one other entity obtains. It asserts, against
an implicit expectation to the contrary, that this is not the entire set of things
for which the situation obtains; the referent of the nominal to which it is
attached being an additional one.
-Ngaddaya TOO clearly contrasts with two other morphemes which
sometimes translate into English as 'too': the enclitic -nyali REP, and the
particle joorloo 'together'. The latter asserts merely that the things concerned areENCLITICS481involved in the situation as a group, and involves no presupposition or
expectation. On the other hand, -ngaddaya TOO does not suggest that there was
concerted involvement in the situation.
-Nyali REP differs from -ngaddaya TOO in terms of scope: the former has
as its scope the presupposed part of the situation, and indicates that it is
repeated; the latter has the new, and non-presupposed part as its scope. There is
no implicit expectation to the contrary (cf. discussion of sense (ii) in section
6.3.2). Compare for instance the following pair:
(6-90) yoowooloo manili biddib -nyali -yingi
man
nose block
REP be:catches:it
goon.goodoo -ngga
snot
ERG
'The man's nose is blocked too.'
(6-91) nganyi -ngaddaya
biddibngindi
I
TOO
it:blocks:me
'My nose is blocked too.'
Both (6-90) and (6-91) involve presuppositions that there was at least one other
person whose nose was blocked. But, with the use of -nyali REP in (6-90). a
new member is simply added to the set of people with colds. By contrast, the
use of -ngaddaya TOO in (6-91) adds the new member in face of an expectation
that it was the members of the presupposed set, and nothing more, for which the
situation obtained. Summarising, in its 'too' sense -nyali REP has a textual
function of continuity (see above page 4 70); but the 'too' sense of -ngaddaya
TOO occurs when this enclitic fulfils an interpersonal function.
These two senses can be accounted for as contextualisations of a single
formal meaning, given in the following formula:
(6-92) -ngaddaya TOO:
Expectation: A 1
Assertion: A 2
where A 1 and A2 are determined by the scope of -ngaddaya TOO, and
A 2 is not contained in A 1•
This differs somewhat from the description given in McGregor (1984b:390),
where it was claimed that the relation between A 1 and A 2 was containment: the
latter contains the former. However, as we will see shortly, this is too strong a
statement; what is invariant is that A 2 is not contained in, but may overlap with,
A 1 • In effect, the asserted adds new things, beyond what was expected, to the class
of things for which the situation obtains. Compare also the Gurindji -payin 'too'
discussed in detail in McConvell (1977:23).","[464, 465]"
"404TiiEClAUSEIn these two examples the non-finite clause is clearly not a circumstance of the
fmite clause; furthermore, there is an intonation break which does not occur in
the embedded -woo DAT clauses above. In constructions of this type, the -woo
DAT verb preceded by the negative particle indicates a strong degree of
unlikeliness or impossibility. It may be because of a social constraint (as in
(5-308), referring to the fact that he will not return to the scene of the murder),
or a physically determined disability (as in (5-309)).
A clue to the interpretation of this construction is afforded by the
following example, in which the occurrence of the DAT postposition on thiddi
'fight' suggests that the -woo clause is indeed embedded. (It appears that thiddi
'fight' has been fractured from the -woo DAT clause.)
(5-310) marlami I jiginya -girli
nothing
little
reallyI mangaddithiddi-yoonotfightDATgardboo -woo I
belt
DAT
'No, he's still too little to fight.'
This suggests that the initial clauses of (5-308) and (5-309), set off by
intonation, are relational characterising clauses perhaps with the Carriers
ellipsed. (5-309) might then be analysed as follows:
(5-311) mangaddi wfxm[ngambiddi gijgiJ]Knf -goo]pp
not
again
getup
DAT
'He can't get up again.'
(Compare example (5-273).)
The ellipsed Carrier might therefore be assumed to be the Actor of the nonfinite clause. More appropriate paraphrases for (5-308) and (5-309) might be
then, 'he is not to return ... ',and 'he was not to get up again'. Unfortunately,
there is no independent evidence for this proposal: there are no examples in
which the Carrier role (in the main clause) is expressed linguistically by an NP
which also fulfils the role of Actor in the non-finite clause. There are, however,
a couple of examples which appear to have a Carrier NP (not coreferential with
the Actor of the non-finite clause):niyaji

Clearly most of the words in Table 5-l do not have modal-type meanings. Rather,
what is being claimed is that they may play modal roles in the clauses in which
they occur.
The lexemes under Expectation require some comment. Scalar is used
following McConvell (1983a) in reference to the situation in which the expected
is ranked with respect to the asserted. For example, in
(5-248) winhi danymiliyidda mangaddi milayidda
just
we:heard:it
not
we:saw:it
'We only heard it, we didn't see it.'
the asserted p:roposition, that we heard it, is ranked lower than the expectation
that we should have seen it. (For further discussion see below sections 6.3.3,
6.3.5, 6.4.7, and 6.4.8.)The temporal adverbials are not only used in locating processes in timealthough this might be seen as their unmarked function - but they are also used
in modifying propositions with respect to expectations. For example, ngamoo
'before' normally occurs in contrast with other time expressions such as
gaddwaroo 'afternoon, yesterday', e.g. in ""frames"" such as:386THE CLAUSE(5-249)ngamoogaddigmibeforeit:fmishedgaddwaroo
afternoon
jamoondoo
other.day
'(The rain) fmished before/yesterday/the other day.'
Such sentences constitute plain responses to information requests such asyaningimi gaddigmi 'When did it finish?' (='It finished sometime'). It is
presupposed that 'the rain stopped sometime'. However, ngamoo before' may
also occur in a contrasting set with mangaddi 'no, not', yiganyi 'uncertain', etc.:
(5-250)ngamoogaddigmibeforeit: finishedmangaddi
notyiganyi
uncertain
'(The rain) has already/not/perhaps finished.'
In this case, these sentences are not plain responses to information requests (i.e.
When did it happen?'). Rather, they are appropriate to a context in which the
status of the Proposition expressed by gaddigmi - '(the rain) has fmished' - is
called to question for some reason. The clause ngamoo gaddigmi (example
(5-250)) occurred in such a situation. The speaker had asserted his belief that the
rain would stop sometime later on in the day. However, on going outside, he
found that it had already stopped raining, upon which he uttered the clause. The
point of the utterance was not to indicate WHEN the rain had stopped, but rather
that it had ALREADY stopped. The first embodies a presupposition that the rain
had already stopped, which was certainly not the case when this clause was
uttered. The presupposition was the negation of this, that the rain had not (yet)
ceased.
The remaining lexeme (see Table 5-1), which I have labeled as a frequency
adverbial, occurs when there is some expectation to the contrary, i.e. an
expectation that the situation does not always occur. Otherwise, in the absence
of such expectations, it would not be used; instead, a more neutral mode of
expression (involving present tense in the VP) would be used- see below

related temporally either as successive or as simultaneous respectively. In the
former instance, clause order (among clauses related by addition) almost always
reflects temporal order of the referent situations. Otherwise the most important
situation is mentioned frrst It would seem reasonable to suppose that the second
clause always extends on the frrst, and is in some sense less primary. Note that,ClAUSE COMPLEXESmefor example, when the relation is of simultaneity. as in (5-366), it is

There is, furthermore, no connecting morpheme with· the adversative or
'contrary to expectation' sense. This relation either goes unmarked (example
(5-369)), or is occasionally indicated by the particle moorda 'certainly' (as in

Additively connected clauses are juxtaposed to one another, and each is as a
rule continuous. In particular, nominal phrases are usually contiguous with the
VP of their own clause. As a rule, if there are shared participants, they are
referred to in the initial clause, and ellipsed in the subsequent one(s).

"382THE CLAUSE5.4 Remarks on the interpersonal organisation of the clause
5.4.1 Propositional modification
A third aspect of the organisation of the clause is its organisation as an
interactive event, involving the interlocutors in the speech situation. In an
interactive event a clause may be used either: (a) to exchange information, or (b)
exchange 'goods and services' (Halliday 1985:68). (This is something of an
oversimplification, although it is useful as an initial hypothesis - see
McGregor 1988c.) Gooniyandi does not distinguish formally between these two
types of act There is no distinct imperative or any other such related category,
either within the verb phrase or within the clause: e.g. a clause in the future
tense may be used in either way, to exchange information, or to exchange 'goods
and services' (see section 6.5.1 below, and cf. Halliday 1985:68).
Simultaneously, the clause may be used in: (i) giving or offering, and (ii)
requesting or demanding. Again these are not distinguished formally in
Gooniyandi. For example, there is no grammatically distinct class of questions
(as has been mentioned already- see section 5.3.1). Exactly the same forms are
used in eliciting information as in giving information. As we have seen, the
enclitic -mi - -ma (see section 6.3.8) which is frequently found in requests of
confrrmation (i.e. 'yes' or 'no'), and the words ngoonyoo 'something (from a
closed set of options', ngoorndoo 'something', etc. (see 3.3.1.2) frequently found
in information requests (where they mean, respectively 'which' and 'who'), really
mark indefiniteness (cf. Dixon 1977:182ft).
That aspect of the meaning of a clause which remains constant across all of
these functions will be referred to as the PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT of the
clause.
In its role in the exchange of information, the propositional content of a
clause is ASSERTED by the speaker. In the case of requests of information (i.e.
corresponding to WH-questions in English) the propositional content involves
an indefinite in the place of the information requested (cf. pages 369-370 above).
That is, the propositional content of the information request (5-240) above,
jajiwami ngabbiddayi ginharndiyiddingga 'What is it that that pair have eaten?' is
'That pair have eaten something.'
In the case of requests of confirmation, as has already been suggested, the
speaker makes an assertion in the hope that the hearer will respond to it, either
confrrming or denying it. (This may be a reflex of the culturally appropriate
mode of information seeking - including confirmation seeking - which
involves at least the pretence of offering something for comment, elaboration,
etc., rather than direct probing - cf. Eades 1982, McGregor 1988c.) TheINTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE383propositional content of the clause may include the element 'indefinite'. Thus,
ward-ma-wiri (go-IND-you:will:go) has a propositional content 'You are going
(or doing something else)'. This assertion invites a response from the hearer. It
is for this reason that I refer to clauses used in the function of exchange of
infonnation as ASSERTIONS.
It should be noted carefully that I am not suggesting that Gooniyandi people do
not ask questions. This is quite false (for further discussion of this point, see
McGregor 1988c). What I am saying is that grammatically there is no distinct
category of questions; the same forms that are used in making statements are also
used in asking questions. This fact itself may lend some support to Eades'
suggestions as to the differences in the way in which Aboriginal and European
cultures exchange (and view) information. The lack of a distinct category means
that it is always possible for either the speaker or the hearer to use the hedge that
the utterance was in fact a statement pure and simple.","[365, 366, 367]"
"It is suggested that the salient syllable marks the FOCUS of the366THE CLAUSEinformation uniL The Focus is the item which the speaker presents as the most
newsworthy, and not recoverable from the preceding discourse; it is always NEW,
in terms of the given/new opposition. In using the term 'new' I do not mean to
suggest that the item must not have been mentioned in the (immediately)
preceding text, or that it may not be present in the extralinguistic situation, as
some writers such as Fronek (1983) have suggested. Rather, as Halliday has
pointed out in many places, new properly applies to items that are evaluated as
not predictable in the circumstances of their occurrence. Thus, for instance, an
entity that the speaker may be sure is identifiable by the hearer, or even present
in his consciousness at the time, may be assigned the value of focal or new, if it
fulfils an unpredictable role in the clause, or if, unpredictably, it plays a role in
the clause at all. This fact has been recognised by Dan~ (1974:111); Chafe, by
contrast, has defined GIVEN as that which is presumed present in the
consciousness of the hearer (1976:30).
In the view proposed here, given and new are LINGUISTIC categories, and
the speaker has available the CHOICE of treating a piece of information as one or
the other. S/he is neither constrained nor forced by extralinguistic factors to
make any particular choice. In other words, the categories given and new are not
pregrammatical or prelinguistic, as has been suggested by writers such as Heath
(1984:606); and furthermore, it is not possible to say on the basis of an
inspection of the linguistic and extralinguistic context that a particular item is
either given or new. There is at best a correlation between the linguistic
categories and the extralinguistic ones, whereby they agree in the majority of
cases. Viewing given and new as pre- or extra-linguistic, linguists have been
forced to conclude that they have no fixed realisation in grammar. By taking the
view advocated in systemic functional grammar, it is clear that there is a direct
relationship between form and meaning - although not between form and
reference. To exemplify this discussion, consider an extract from Text 1 (line
(5)), repeated here as example (5-213).
(5-213) moongaya I milawawinmi
bidi -yooddoo -ngga I
morning
they:were:looking they dual
ERG
1n the morning, they two were looking (at the fishing lines).'
Given the textual context of its occurrence, it would be natural for the speaker to
presume that the hearer is able to identify the two individuals referred to by
bidiyooddoongga 'by they two', and even that they were in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. But to claim that this phrase is therefore given is to miss
the point; there is no reason for a hearer to suppose that only the two individuals11ffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF 11ffi CLAUSE367other than the speaker went to look at the fishing lines in the morning. This is
the reason why the speaker chose to represent bidiyooddoongga 'by they two' as
new and focal information. Thus, only by maintaining the distinction between
linguistic meaning and reference (or core and contextual meaning) can significant
generalisations be made.
The salient syllable most frequently falls on one of the stressed syllables of
the final clausal IC (phrase, adverbial or particle) in the tone unit An exception
to this generalisation concerns the group of clauses which I have referred to as
situations of being (see section 5.2.1.2). These are clauses which have one of
the three stance verbs bagi- 'lie', warang- 'sit' and wara- 'stand', and assert either
the existence of an entity, an attribute of an entity, or a niche the entity
inhabits. In these clauses, the VP always comes finally in the tone unit to
which it belongs, and is never salient. Any stressed syllable within the salient
phrase may have the main stress, although there may be a tendency for the main
stress to fall on the main lexical item in the IC. Salience placement is probably
semantically conditioned: apparently in NPs it identifies phrase level focus, that
is, the item evaluated as the most newsworthy item of the phrase.
It follows from the preceding paragraph that the information Focus usually
falls on the final IC in an information unit This is, however, a tendency, and
not a grammatical rule. Any distributional word in the information unit,
regardless of its position, may be focal. It is hypothesised that the UNMARKED
place for information Focus is on the final IC in the information unit. This
placement is unmarked in respect that the preceding material in the information
unit may be either given or new. An information unit with final Focus may
thus occur in any of the three logically possible circumstances, where the
preceding material is given, new, or some given and some new. The Focus is
MARKED when it occurs on a non-final constituent Here again, the preceding
material may be either given, new, or some given and some new. But the
material following the Focus is positively specified as given or retrievable. That
is, the Focus falls on a non-final constituent only under the condition that the
material following it is given. Conversely, placement of given information
following new information may be presumed to be a marked order.
A number of observations support this claim.
(1) Contrastive focus normally falls on a non-final constituent. For
example,
(5-214) nginyji lililoowa wardbiri I nganyi nginulangaddi

'We split up; I went down, he went up.'
\\eAs is well known (see for example Chafe 1976:33-34}, a contrastive clause
normally involves a presupposition that the situation obtained for someone,
something, or in certain circumstances, or that a certain individual (or time,
place, etc.) was involved in some situation or other. (5-214) is a direct quote and
comes from a text in which a head police tracker is giving instructions to
another tracker. It is reasonable to assume that there is a presupposition that
each would go in some direction.
(5-214) and (5-215) show that the presupposed material (or a linguistic
expression representing it in whole or part) follows the Focus. What is
presupposed is of course given, and is explicitly marked as such by its
placement after the Focus. On the other hand, being given, presupposed material
is likely to be ellipsed, resulting in a construction with unmarked Focus- see
line (41) of Text 1.
(2) The placement of the propositional modifiers mangaddi 'no, not',
yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed', etc., conftrm the above pattern.
Immediately following non-final foci are contrastive. Consider example (5-216},
which comes from a text concerning a man who got lost in the desert. The
immediately preceding text had described him starting on his way back home.
Thus it is presupposed that he was returning home, and the material following
the Focus, wardji riwiyidda 'he went to his camp', constitutes given information.
The adverbial thiddgirli 'straight' is thus a point of contrastive focus, contrasting
with the Focus of the following information unit, ngilayani ngiwayinyali 'east
and south again'.riwiyidda I ngiwayi wardji

either formally by morphology or syntax, or, as far as I can tell, prosodically.
Information requests are made indirectly by statements offering some
information, but leaving something indefinite (cf. Eades 1982). In this way, the
speaker may hope to elicit a response filling in the indefmite blank. Information
requests use the indefinite determinersjaji 'something', ngoorndoo 'someone' and
ngoonyoo 'something', as well as the adverbials yiniga 'somehow' and
yaningimi (morphologically 'now-indefinite') 'sometime'. These indefinite words
are always the information Focus in information requests - but not all
utterances in which they are focal are questions, or construed as questions. The
reason for this is obvious: the speaker would quite naturally single out and draw
attention to the indefinite or unknown part of his utterance, the part s/he seeks
elaboration of or comment on, as the most newsworthy. In addition, the
indefinite word is typically non-final (unless it is the only element in the unit),
and a marked information Focus. (5-217) is an example:
(5-217) ngoorndoo -ngga ngaaddi widdbginyja I
someone
ERG stone
you:throw:it
'Who are you throwing stones.'
The explanation for the fact that the indefinite word is a marked Focus is
that questions are pragmatically marked (see Goody 1978), and typically involve
a presupposition that the predication holds true for at least one entity, place,
time, etc .. And this presupposition may be treated as given information. For
(5-217), the action was of course situationally obvious.
I remark that in ''rhetorical questions'"" - that is, utterances which look like
questions but which are not used to elicit infonnation, and for which straight
linguistic responses would be judged inadequate - the indefinite word is not
nonnally focal. The Focus is unmarked, and falls on the VP in (5-218), which is a
quoted utterance of a white head stockman to his Aboriginal workers questioning
their action of cutting a bullock skin which he had explicitly instructed them not
to do. Presumably he was not merely seeking infonnation.
-yoo gajgilanggidda I
(5-218) jaji
something DAT you:plural:have:cut:it
'Why have you cut it?'
In a similar way, when the indefmite word is followed by either -widdi UNKN or
-ngaddaya TOO, there is not usually any presupposition involved. And the
indefinite word, or the distributional word it forms a part of, does not nonnally
constitute a marked Focus. These observations are exemplified in (5-219), which
shows that the resulting utterance closely approximates clauses with indefinites in
English:370THE ClAUSE

"2INTRODUCTIONthe low vowel only. There are no sibilants or fricatives, v01cmg is not
distinctive, and stress has a purely delimitative function (Trubetzkoy 1969:27).
Words almost always begin with a consonant, very rarely with a consonant
cluster; the apical distinction is neutralised word initially. Word medially a fairly
large number of two member consonant clusters occur. Non-verbal roots are
nearly all disyllabic or longer and typically end in vowels. Verbal roots are
phonotactically unusual (cf. Dixon 1980: 159): a large number are monosyllabic,
and many end in consonants, occasionally consonant clusters.
Lexical words may be divided into three main classes or parts-of-speech,
each with a number of subclasses: nominals, verbals, and adverbials. These are
open classes, each with a large number of members. Pronominals constitute a
distinct closed class and distinguish three persons and two numbers. Instead of
the inclusive/exclusive distinction normally found in the first person nonsingular in Australian languages, Gooniyandi makes a restricted/unrestricted
distinction. In this system, the unrestricted pronominal refers to the speaker, the
hearer, and at least one other individual; the restricted pronominal refers either to
the speaker and the hearer, or to the speaker and one or more persons other than
the hearer. In terms of the traditional categories, the unrestricted pronominal
corresponds to first person plural (more than two) inclusive, while the restricted
pronominal corresponds to the first person dual (either inclusive or exclusive) or
the first person plural exclusive.
Noun classes are not distinguished in Gooniyandi, and nominals do not
inflect for number or case. Instead, number and case information is conveyed by
means of phrase-level enclitics, which are referred to in this book as
postpositions. There are number-marking postpositions distinguishing dual and
plural numbers, and case-marking postpositions conveying ergative, dative,
ablative, allative, locative, and other local meanings. Gooniyandi nominal
phrase marking is not split ergative (Silverstein 1976b, Dixon 1979): any NP
regardless of its person or number may be ergatively marked. The ergative
postposition is, however, optional for all phrase types in the 'transitive subject'
function. Word order in the NP is free in the sense that determiners and
adjectives may precede or follow the nominal they modify. However, the NP
may be described in terms of a fixed sequence of functions or roles that the
constituent words realise.
The verbal complex has properties characteristic of both phrases and words.
It is phrase-like in its position on the rank scale (Halliday 1961/1976): it is a
clausal constituent whose ""granddaughters"" are items of morpheme rank; it is
word-like in that it is a single distributional unit, the constituents of whichlANGUAGE TYPE3occur in a fixed order. There are two obligatory constituents in the verbal
complex: a verbal stem, which always occurs initially, and a 'classifier
complex'. This classifier complex consists of, in the following order: a tense
marking prefix, bound pronominal prefixes which cross-reference certain actants
in the clause, and a 'classifier'. The tense system distinguishes four tenses (past,
present, irrealis and future); the pronominal prefixes on the whole inflect on a
nominative-accusative pattern, and generally show the same person and number
distinctions as do the free pronominals; and the classifiers distinguish twelve
classes of processes (based on aspectual type and valence, to put it loosely). In
addition the verbal complex may have one or more of a number of optional
constituents which provide aspectual and modal qualification, and a further
system of bound pronominals referring to other ('oblique') actants. Although
these constituents occur in a fixed order, their phonemic shapes, and the
boundaries between them, are frequently obscured by morphophonemic
processes.
Spatial adverbs, indicating location and direction, are frequent in motion
(and other) clauses: compass directions are used in preference to left-right
orientation, and temporal sequence is expressed by spatial metaphor. There are
also temporal and manner adverbials.
Modality and other forms of speaker evaluation of a proposition are
encoded in free particles (marking negation, mistaken belief, retribution,
repetition, certainty, uncertainty, and so on} and enclitics (carrying meanings
like 'only', 'again', 'else', 'like', 'etcetera', and so on).
Two main types of clause, verbal and verbless, are distinguishable,
depending on whether or not there is an inherent (see page 293 below) verbal
complex. Verbal clauses show four (not two- cf. Dixon 1980:278ft) distinct
'transitivity' types: intransitive, transitive, middle and reflexive/reciprocal. These
are defined by the ""case frames"" of the inherent nominal phrase constituents.
Intransitive clauses take a single unmarked NP; transitive clauses have a phrase
which may be ergatively marked and an unmarked phrase; middle clauses have a
phrase which may be ergatively marked together with a dative phrase; and
reflexive/reciprocal clauses have a single phrase, which is optionally ergatively
marked. Verbless clauses are either attributive, identifying, or existential. As in
the majority of Australian languages, constituent order is 'free' (Dixon
1980:441), in the sense that changing it does not affect the referential or
experiential meaning (Halliday 1974:47) of a clause. Constituent order is,
however, significant in respect of the textual organisation of the clause (Halliday
1974:47) - that is, the way in which the clause is organised as a message4INTRODUCTIONbearing unit. In particular, Gooniyandi is a theme-first language.
Clause complexes consist of paratactically or hypotactically related clauses.
However, it is impossible to distinguish these two types (or any others) on
purely formal criteria. There are no morphological markers signalling the
interclausal relationships, no structural differences between constituent clauses of
clause complexes and independent clauses, and no necessary cross-clause
reference relations (see Matthiessen and Thompson forthcoming, and compare
Dixon 1980:461). The clause complex types have linguistic validity as COVERT
categories (Wharf 1945/1972: 104). There is, however, a close connection
between subordination and mood, whereby subordinate clauses always have their
verb in a marked, non-indicative mood, either subjunctive or factive.","[14, 15, 16, 17]"
"34INTRODUCTIONan intcractant in the situation might make. In this way the possible senses of
!he English prompt are relatively restricted and there is a better .ch~ce that the
linguist and the native speaker were referring to the same sttuattons, from
similar viewpoints.
Formally elicited utterances can never be completely deco~textu.alised, ~d all
sorts of speakers' behaviour indicated that they did no~ pe:cetve elt~er th~~ o_wn
or my utterances as isolated. For instance, frequent swttchmg of toptc, ehcttatwn
of paradigms, and requests for implausible utterances (such as 'you died') were
frequently met with by resistance such as boredom, and, less frequently. re~sal to
produce the requested form. More interestingly, the entities I established m my
English prompts were treated as belonging to the participant-register of the
discourse, and where possible, treated as ""given"" (Halliday 1970: 162). Speakers
did not like being forced to translate the English NPs verbatim (see also below
page 251 and section 5.3.1). It is clear that speakers regarded the elicitation
process as text-producing, and their responses were characteristic of genres
appropriate to the referential content. Much of the formally elicited data is, then,
in a sense controlled, or constructed text, rather than isolated, decontextualised
sentences. The primary thrust of elicitation was to develop and construct such
contexts as might not frequently arise in conditions where recording was possible.
Because elicitation is text-producing, and because many morphemes and
morpheme combinations are unlikely to arise in free texts, I do not even aspire to
Heath's (1984:4) ideal of a ""corpus-based grammar"" (where 'corpus' includes free
!t•xts only). Although I am mindful of the many dangers inherent in using elicited
materials. I cannot concur with Heath's assessment that he had "" ... no confidence
whatever in such data, since my own early ""data"" of this type often turned out to
be: seriously wrong"" (Heath 1984:5). As I will discuss later, I feel that this
mtsrepresents the nature of linguistic data, by taking it to be an observable
Clbject, independent of the observer.
By far the most problematic aspects of elicitation seem to me to relate to
the practices of seeking speakers' judgements of utterance acceptability (see
~low), and their intuitions and explanations of meaning differences. In the
mcumstances of ~y field:vork these did not prove to be very satisfactory field

have. fm:nd that the phonetic contrasts in Gooniyandi are not as perceptible to
the English car as are tlle phonetic contrasts between the corresponding segmentsDATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION35in some other Australian languages); and (2) the question of whether the cont.rnst
between apico-alveolars and apico-postalveolars is neutralised word initia1ly (as
it is in many Australian languages). Many words were checked with more than
one speaker, and over more than one repetition (successively and on different
occasions), using both auditory and visual evidence. From this work, I produced
a dictionary of about I 000 items, the phonemic representation of which I am
relatively confident. This dictionary, which includes all items of Hale's 100 word
list, the relevant items of Douglas (1959/1977), as well as all words from the
texts chosen for the school book, and a number of 'suspicious' and crucial words,
is the primary data base for the statistical analysis of phoneme distributions
(section 2.2.5).
The investigation into tlw textual organisation of the clause (section 5.3),
as well as a significant part of the study of the clause complex (section 5.6), is
based primarily on textual material. (Initial hypotheses were, however,
formulated on the basis of the elicited corpus.) From a large corpus of twenty or
more hours of recorded texts, fifteen texts were selected for close scrutiny; three
of these appear in Appendix I. These fifteen texts, which were chosen more or
less at random- and not for any reac;ons of their merit as coherent texts- are
monologues encompassing all genres represented in the corpus. There is no
reason to b~lieve that they are not typical representatives of their genres. They
were narrated by three different individuals, including the youngest and the oldest
speakers. The chosen texts vary in length from about a minute and a half to over
ten minutes, in all totaling about forty-five minutes. Altogether there are alXlllt
800 clauses. The texts had been transcribed word for word in the field with the
assistance of the speaker; most had also been worked over on at least one
occasion with another native speaker. I studied them again away from the field,
attempting to identify and mark in significant suprascgmental features, which I
was convinced played an important role in the organisation of the text as a
message bearing unit (sec section 5.3).
The reader will notice that no sentences are starred as unacceptable or
ungrammatical in this grammar. The present description is based entirely on
occurring, and ipso facto acceptable, sentences. Problems in eliciting acceptance
or rejection of conslructed examples arc well known, and I will not go into them
here- but see for example Bolinger (1968), Christie (1980), Haas (1973), and
Quirk and Svartvik (1966). Suffice it to make Lhe following three observations,
specific to the context of my research. Firstly, speakers were as a rule unwilling
to label utterances I produced a<> unacceptable - rather than respond to the actual
form of my utterance, they almost invariably presumed that I intended to express36INTRODUCTIONsome meaning, and attempted to determine and respond appropriately to that.
And secondly, on the other hand, in more than one instance in which a speaker
had firmly rejected an invented example, he later used the same construction
himself. The reasons for the initial rejection always remained unclear to me.
Finally, my theoretical purpose is not, and was not, to delimit the class of
grammatical sentences (if indeed such a class is well defined - cf. Hocketl
1967), but rather to describe and account for the meaning potential of
Gooniyandi utterances.","[46, 47, 48, 49]"

and the accompanied entities are of unequal status- see section 5.2.3.5.
(c) something in close association with an entity, such as a possession.
The possession may be either alienable (example (4-78)) or inalienable (example
(3-98)).
(3-98) ngaragnga goornboo gamoo -ngaddi
he:made:it woman
breast COMIT
'He painted a woman with breasts.'
As examples (4-78) and (3-98) demonstrate, this sense arises when the
-ngaddi PP fulfils a role in a phrase. It also occurs when the comitative PP
functions as Attribute in a characterising clause - see section 5.2.1.1.1.2.
There is, however, as has already been mentioned, no reason to regard nominals
marked with -ngaddi COMITas derived adjectives (cf. Dixon 1980:324-325).
Finally, there are a few apparently irregular uses of -ngaddi COMIT, in
which this postposition seems to function as a stem forming suffix:
yoowarningaddi (one-COMIT) 'once', ngirndangaddi (this-COMIT) 'this way',
ngirndangaddingga (this-COMIT-ERG) 'this side'. ngooddoongaddingga (thatCOMIT-ERG) 'that side', yinigangaddi (somehow-COMIT) 'by some means, by
what means'. There are also half a dozen or so mother-in-law avoidance
nominals, including bin.gidi-ngaddi (feather-COMIT) 'bird' and wanya-ngaddi
(emu feather-COMIT) 'emu', which are analysable as ordinary nominal plus the188THE WORDcomitative postposition.3.7.2.10 -winyja DEPrivative
The postposition -winyja DEP is quite infrequent in occurrence, and seems to be
used in only one function. That is, to indicate something - always a thing,
never a process - the lack of which causes an event to occur; see section
5.2.3.6 and examples (5-159) and (5-160).
It should be noted that Gooniyandi has no bound morpheme, either suffix
or postposition, that functions as a regular privative marker. Instead, to express
this meaning, the negative particle marlami 'nothing, without' is used following
(usually) the nominal referring to the thing lacked. The contrast between these
two expressions, NP-winyja, and [N mar/ami], is that the former has the
additional semantic component, absent from the latter, that the lack of the thing
is the cause of the process. In keeping with this, only the latter occurs in
relational clauses expressing 'x has no y'.3.7.2.11 -yooddoo - -yiddi DUal and -yarndi PLural
These two postpositions, -yooddoo- -yiddi DU and -yarndi PL, optionally mark
the number of an NP as either dual or plural (three or more) respectively. As yet
it is not clear what factors motivate the occurrence or non-occurrence of these
morphemes on non-singular NPs. (A likely hypothesis is that they are used: (i)
in initial specification of number, and otherwise (ii) to help keep reference clear,
for instance when a text involves two (or more) groups of items which would be
referred to by the same nominal, but which consist of different numbers of these
items. But this hypothesis has not been tested by extensive textual
investigation.) Examples of usage include (4-77), (4-86), (4-95), (4-96), and
lines (5), (21) and (61) of Text 1, and line (6) of Text 2.
3.8 EncliticsUnlike postpositions and stem forming suffixes, enclitics do not form, together
with the units to which they are attached, other grammatical units of the same
rank as those to which they are attached. Therefore, enclitics do not allow for
recursive embedding, such as is possible to a limited extent with postpositions
and stem forming suffixes.
The following are the main enclitics:•
ENCUTICS-moowa
-nyooloo
-ngaddaya
-widdi
-jangi-rni
-mi- -ma
-nyali
-woo189'only' (ON)
'etcetera' (ETC)
'else, too' (TOO)
'identity unknown' (UNKN)
'like' (SEM)
'next, now' (SEQ)
'indefinite, question' (IND)
'repetition, again' (REP)
'definite' (DEF)The glosses given above should not be taken seriously; they are meant to be no
more than suggestive. For a detailed discussion of the meanings of these
morphemes, see section 6.3 below.
The enclitic -jangi SEM is exceptional in that it sometimes forms a g-unit with
the constituent to which it is attached - see for instance, examples (6-95) and
(6-96) below. The fact that it does not ALWAYS form such a unit justifies its
classification as an enclitic. This does, however, necessitate a slight modification
to the definition given in the first paragraph of this section: enclitics are
morphemes which do not necessarily form g-units with the units to which they are
attached. (Postpositions and stem forming suffixes always do.)The enclitics show very little allomorphy - which is partly because none
of the initial consonants are affected by rules discussed in section 2.4. The
indefinite enclitic is the only one showing altemant forms. Its allomorphs -rna
and -mi are chosen depending on the class of the item to which they are attached:
-ma if it is verbal, -mi otherwise.
Two subsets may be distinguished: the first, consisting of the six
morphemes -moowa ON, -nyooloo ETC, -ngaddaya TOO, -widdi UNKN, -jangi
SEM and -rni SEQ from the list above, may be attached to non-verbal units
only, while the remaining three occur with all classes of units, verbal and nonverbal. When attached to non-verbal items, enclitics typically occur in final
position, following all other bound morphemes. But in the VP, -rna IND and
-nyali REP occur medially, in order class (3), labeled Mood in formula F1 on
page 192 below; that is, it follows the first grammatical word of the VP. -Woo
DEF, by contrast, follows the CC word and occurs in position (5), labeled Mode
in Fl. Placement of the enclitics is not arbitrary, but correlates with the 'scope'
and 'focus' of the enclitic (see section 6.3).
Sequences of enclitics do occur, though too infrequently to permit firm
generalisations to be made at this stage; I suspect (but cannot demonstrate) that
their order is meaningful. The only sequence that is at all common is190'IHEWORD-jangi-nyali SEM-REP 'just/exactly like', as in minyawoo-jangi-nyali (cat-SEMREP) 'just like a cat'.
3.9 The verb phrase
In this section I discuss the structure of the 'verb' - that distributional word and
grammatical phmse which realises the clausal role of Process.
3.9.1 Verbals
Verbals have already been def""med as those lexical (open-class) words which are
bound; all other lexical words have the privilege of free occurrence. Verbals have
just two contexts of occurrence: they occur either as constituents of finite VPs,
or as non-finite verbs. Although words of other classes may occur in the first
context, only verballexemes occur in the second. Furthennore, every verbal may
occur within a non-finite 'purposive' clause, in which construction it is followed
by the -woo allomorph of the dative postposition (see page 174 above)- e.g.
ward-goo (go-D AT) 'for going', bayal-woo (swim-DAT) 'for swimming'.
Another distinctive property of verbals is, as we have already seen, that, as a
class, they show phonotactic differences from the words of other lexical classes:
final consonants are permitted and frequent (section 2.2.5); there are statistically
significant differences in distribution of initial consonants in verbals compared
with other classes (section 2.2.5); and there is a high frequency of (closed)
monosyllables (section 2.3.1).
I have been unable to distinguish subclasses within the class of verbals. In
particular, it is not possible to distinguish disjoint classes of transitive and
intransitive verbals (cf. Dixon 1980:378). Whereas in many Australian
languages transitivity may be regarded as a lexical feature of verbs (Dixon
1980:278), in Gooniyandi transitivity has a clausal locus, and a single verbal
lexeme may occur in clauses of more than one transitivity type. Choice of
classifier may go some way towards distinguishing the transitivity of a VP for example, ward-ji (go-PAST/(3sg)N+I) 'he went' vs. ward-nga (goPAST/(3sg)N+A) 'he took it'. However, it proves equally impossible to
distinguish transitivity classes at phrase level as at word level (see sections
5.2.1.3 and 6.5.5 below).
Verbals in Gooniyandi constitute a large open class of lexemes which refer
to all sorts of processes, including: states (e.g. wara- 'stand', bagi- 'lie'); changes
of state (e.g. nang- 'die'); motion, including induced motion (e.g. ward- 'go,
walk, bring'); violent actions (such as gard- 'hit, fell', bananggadd- 'snatch');THE VERB PHRASE191perception and mental processes (e.g. danymili- 'hear, listen'. mila- 'see, look');
communication (for examplejangi- 'answer',jag- 'tell'); and so on.
3.9.2 The non-finite verb
Within non-finite clauses, which are always embedded in some other unit
(section 5.5), there occurs a semantically impoverished verbal construction
which consists of either a bare verbal stem, or of a verbal stem followed by an
infinitive, either -bari (section 5.5.3.1) or -mawoo (section 5.5.3.2). As a
constituent of a clause, the non-finite verbal construction ought to be of phrase
level. However, since the only way in which a verbal root may be expanded is
by the addition of a (verbal) stem forming suffix (see section 3.12.2.1), or by
the addition of an infinitive, there seems to be little independent reason to regard
the construction as a phrase, and as a consequence, I do not make this
assumption. In contrast with the finite VP, the non-finite verb carries very little
information about the process: no reference is made to the participants involved
in it, temporal and modal distinctions are not made, and the semantic type of the
process is not indicated.
When there is no infinitive, the verbal stem, being a bound form, must be
followed by another morpheme, either a postposition or a nominal stem forming
suffix (see 3.12.1.1 below), depending on whether the non-finite clause is
embedded under a PP node or under a word node. (Postpositions and stem
forming suffixes, as distinct from infinitives, are not constituents of the nonfinite verb, as will be shown below, in section 5.5.) Infinitival constructions are
usually found in non-finite clauses attributing on participant roles (section 5.2)
in the finite clauses in which they (the non-finite clauses) are embedded. In the
present data, -ngga ERG is the only postposition that ever follows an infinitive.
(Further fieldwork may uncover other combinations.)
3.9.3 The finite verb phrase
Finite VPs occur in non-embedded ""situation"" type clauses (see section 5.2.1),
in which they realise the role of Process. A finite VP consists of two obligatory
constituents, a lexical 'head' referring to the process, and a classifier complex
(CC), which indicates the person and number of the main participants in the
process (see 5.2.1.3 below), tense, and the type of process it is (in terms of the
features described in section 6.5.5 below). In addition to these two obligatory
constituents there are a number of optional elements carrying aspectual, modal
and other qualification of the process. A schematic representation of the VP isTHE WORD192
given in the following formula:F1 Process-(Aspect)-(Mood)-CC-(Mode)-(Oblique pronominal)-(Number)
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
where brackets enclose optional elements.
As was claimed earlier, this unit is a singled-word of phrasal rank; it is
not an inflectional form of the Process lexeme. Its two obligatory constituents
are g-words. The' remaining, optional constituents are enclitics to these words.
That is, these optional constituents do not form g-words with the obligatory
constituents. There is no evidence, for example, that Process plus Aspect is an
inflectional form of the lexical root filling the role of Process, or that the two
together form a distinct stem. In the absence of such evidence, I make the
weakest assumption, that the aspect markers etc. are constituents of the verb
phrase.
A finite VP may consist of between two and four (perhaps five at the
most) phonological words (as defined in section 2.5.1). The two grammatical
words, the item realising the role of Process, and the CC, are usually distinct
phonological words; but, as mentioned earlier (see pages 128 and 135), the
boundary of the phonological word may move forwards, and so not coincide with
the grammatical boundary. Monosyllabic enclitics are, with one exception,
unstressed and cohere with the preceding phonological word. The exception is
the bound oblique pronominal enclitic -nhi 'to him/her/it', which takes stress.
Enclitic morphemes of two or more syllables are usually phonological words,
and are stressed on their initial syllable. There are just a few exceptions without
initial stress, all of which have an initial {w}, which is affected by VR6: {wila}
FACT (see below 3.9.3.4); the allomorph {wanhi} of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic (see section 3.9.3.6); and the allomorph ( waddi} of
the paucal number enclitic (see section 3.9.3.7).
It appears that (3) (Mood) and (5) (Mode) in Fl are in complementary
distribution; otherwise there are examples displaying choices from all other
combinations of categories. Some examples (written phonemically) are:

(3-99) gaddig(2)

"544TOPICS IN SEMANTICS6.5.4 Mood
6.5.4.1 Subjunctive mood
The use of subjunctive mood - realised by the verbal enclitic -ja- - in
subordinate clauses has been discussed already, in section 5.6.2.1.3 above. The
subjunctive is not, however, restricted to occurring in subordinate clauses, and is
frequently found in independent clauses in the unreal tenses (future and irrealis);
the combination with real tenses (past and present) is rare in independent clauses.
It follows that the Gooniyandi subjunctive is not primarily a device for marking
the subordinate status of the· clause, as the subjunctive appears to be in
languages such as French (Lyons 1968:312).
Two major uses of the subjunctive can be identified in independent clauses.
Firstly, there is the interpersonal use in which it is asserted or proposed (in the
sense of 5.4.1) that the proposition expressed by the clause is hypothesised,
supposed, reckoned, wished, hoped, claimed, or whatever. In other words, the
difference between an unmodalised clause and the clause in the subjunctive is
parallel to the difference between P and 1-P (cf. Mendelson 1964:30, McCawley
1981:39), and -ja- SUBJ functions like the operator 1-. This means that the
speaker is not uttering a proposition about the world, but a proposition about a
proposition about the world. This use of the subjunctive translates into English
as 'I assert, claim, hypothesise, predict, hope, know, wish, declare, reckon, (etc.)
that P', or 'let's suppose, hypothesise, assume, (etc.) that P'. This interpersonal
use also occurs in conditional hypotactic clause complexes, in which the
antecedent clause - which refers to the hypothesised condition - occurs in
subjunctive mood (section 5.6.2.1.3).
Secondly, there is an experiential use, in which the subjunctive 'operator'
becomes a part of the experiential meaning conveyed. That is, the speaker asserts
that someone hypothesises, supposes, reckons, wishes, hopes, or claims (etc.)
the proposition to be the case. This involves a further 'embedding' of the
proposition: i.e. the speaker asserts (someone asserts or proposes (it is
hypothesised/believed/entertained/hoped (etc.) that P)). Compare the two uses,
experiential and interpersonal, of the particles yiganyi 'uncertain' and thaddi
'mistakenly believed'- see sections 6.4.5 and 6.4.4 respectively.
In the following two subsections I will examine the contextual meanings
of the subjunctive in independent clauses, discussing first the senses that arise in
assertions, then those which arise in proposals. In these subsections, each tense
combination will be taken in tum. It is important to stress that there is no
suggestion that the senses identified below are linguistically significanLVERBAL CATEGORIES5456.5.4.1.1 Subjunctive mood in assertions
[1] Future subjunctive. In independent clauses, the subjunctive is most
often found with the future tense, and a considerable proportion of independent
clauses in the corpus - I would estimate around a quarter to a third - which
project into future time, are in the subjunctive mood. The following contextual
senses are attested. Of course, it should be borne in mind that each example is
open to multiple interpretations; I give the interpretation appropriate to the
situation in which the example occurred, together with brief remarks on that
situation.
(a) Interpersonal. Here, as I have already said, the speaker asserts a
claim, hypothesis, or whatever, not a proposition.
(a~i) Predictions. It has already been mentioned (section 6.5.1.3) that the
use of the plain future tense makes a claim to the occurrence of a situation at a
given point of time in the future, or otherwise immediately. Furthennore, it has
a far stronger sense than merely predicting that a situation will occur, and as I
have said, it is never used in making general non-time-bound predictions (section
6.5.1.3). The subjunctive future is used when the speaker does not subscribe
strongly to the future occurrence of the situation; s/he sees it as subject to some
uncertainty. This is normally because s/he does not have adequate factual
evidence on which to base the statement: s/he is simply guessing, or predicting
that it will happen. In the following example the speaker was merely predicting
what I would do after I left him.
(6~288) babligaj -nhingi ngilanggoopub
thoodABL--ja
OOscend SUBJeasthalma yoowarni
creek one~wingganiFUT+(2sg)N+ANI'From the pub you'll go east, and cross one creek.'
Another example is the second clause of the paratactic clause complex in
example (6-181).
(a-ii) Truths. The subjunctive future may be used in reference to future
certainties, which, however, the speaker is unable or unwilling to locate
temporally. For example, in the Kimberley region~ which has a well defined wet
season, everyone takes it for granted that the rivers will regularly rise and fall
throughout the season. However, exactly when events such as described in
(6~289) will occur can't be known for sure.","[524, 525, 526]"
"Here, minyjidda 'true' modifies the proposition expressed by the second clause,ClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS503asserting: 'it is true that I'm sick'. At the same time it indicates the seriousness
of the sickness contrasting this with the presumption that the speaker is
pretending.
Like other particles indicating speaker attitudes, minyjidda 'true' occurs in
clauses of speech in the sense of 'speak the truth' (not - in the available
examples - in the sense of 'actually speak').
-ngadda
(6-160) minyjidda jagma
true
you:will:tell to:me
'Tell me truly.'","[486, 487]"
"Yaningi is a temporal adverbial which, like ngamoo 'before', may locate an
event either with respect to the speech situation, in which case it means 'now',
or with respect to another described event, in which case it means 'at the same
time'. In its first use at least, the exact temporal expanse covered may vary
considerably, depending on what 'now' is presumed to contrast with. It can mean
anything from 'right now', 'at this very instant', 'now, any or all of the time
from the beginning of the present speech situation to its end', 'today', to 'these
days (as opposed to the early days, etc.)' .
Yaningi 'now' may also be used as a Propositional Modifier. For example,
in{6-181) wamba -nyali marla -ya
goorijga
yaningi -nyali
later
REP hand LOC he:holds:it now
REPTOPICS IN SEMANI'ICS510ba/ayawi
he:will:send:it
'He's still got (the letter) in his hand, (but) he'll send it directly.'
(Note: speaker's gloss used the term directly.)
it would seem that it is not taken for granted that the person concerned will post
the letter at all- perhaps he looks undecided about it. That is, yaningi 'now'
provides more than a temporal location for the process, and contrasts with e.g.
yiganyi 'uncertain', mangaddi 'not', and so on.
6.4.12 yaniyaningi 'right now'
This word is clearly a partial reduplication of yaningi 'now', and has a formal
meaning predictable from this, 'right now, at the very time'. That is,
reduplication has the effect of intensification.
Yaniyaningi 'right now' seems to occur only with extendible processes, or
with the progressive of accomplishments, and appears to usually suggest that
the process has just been entered into, as of the speech situation time (see
example (6-182)), or as of the time of the events described (see example (6-183):
(6-182) yiwindi -garainyaniyaningi -nyali gadgoowaanboo
ERG right:now

right:now
I:ate:it ck>or
gardbigardbinga
-ngadlahe:knocked:it:repeatedly on:me
'I had just started to eat when he knocked on the door.'
In case the comparison is with respect to speech situation time,
yaniyaningi 'right now' seems to normally counter an expectation that the
process has not yet started, and for this reason appropriate English glosses may
involve 'already'. For example,
(6-184) yaniyaningi thangarndi thigiwaarigiribjawidi
right:now
wool
it:is:getting:short we:might:finish:it
The cassette is already getting short; we'll be finishing up.'was uttered in a context in which the speaker was surprised that the time hadClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIAI.S511passed so quickly, and the cassette had almost run ouL
Both yaniyaningi 'right now' and ngamoo 'before' (see section 6.4.10) may
be felicitously translated as 'already' in certain circumstances, with the
progressive aspect. The difference seems to be that whereas yaniyaningi 'right
now' suggests that the 'train' of progress has just started, ngamoo 'before'
suggests that it started some time ago. Thus the use of ngamoo 'before' in this
context gives the sense of greater immediacy or imminence of the attainment of
the accomplishment. Thus, (6-180) above makes a stronger claim than
(6-185) mangaddi marnangooddoo yaniyaningi graaggoowayinmi
not
far
right:now
we:are:nearing:it
'It's not far now, we're already nearing (our destination).'6.4.13 wamba 'later'
The interpretation of this adverbial poses some difficulties. It would appear to
form the third member of a triplet with ngamoo 'before, an indefinite time in the
past', andyaningi 'now, an indefinite time including the present', to indicate 'an
indefinite time in the future'. The temporal reference point is usually the speech
situation time, and the VP usually occurs in the future tense, as the following
example shows.
(6-186) wamba jalbawinggiddinya
later
I:will:meet:you:pl
'I will meet you lot later.'
But, as is the case for ngamoo 'before' and yaningi 'now', another reference
point may be chosen, the time set up in the events described. I have been unable
to locate examples in which wamba 'later' is used in locating past events with
respect to one another (of the type illustrated in (6-179) and (6-183)). In (6-187)
and (6-188), however, the present event is located in the future with respect to
the understood or presupposed situations.
(6-187) wamba -nyali waranggiri gamba -wini ngoorloogga

REP he:sits
water IND he:drinks:it
'He's probably still sitting there drinking.'
(6-188) wamba -nyali mangaddi bijgoowaarni

REP not
it:is:emerging
'It (the island) still hasn't emerged (from the floodwaters).'
In (6-187) it was already established that the individual concerned had been512TOPICS 1N SEMANTICSdrinking at an earlier time in the day (he had been seen), and in (6-188), it was
part of the common knowledge of everyone in the town that, as of recently, the
islands in the river were still under the floodwaters.
The preceding two sentences do more than just locate the present situation
with respect to one presupposed in the past. By implication, continuity of the
present situation with the past is suggested, and wamba 'later' appears to be
functioning as a Propositional Modifier. The occurrence of wamba 'later', that is,
contradicts an explicit expectation that the situation located at the earlier time
might have ceased to obtain now. (Cf. the discussion of sense (v) of -nyali REP,
in section 6.3.2.) In this context, wamba 'later' usually translates into English
as 'still'.
In fact, it would appear that this interpersonal usage of wamba 'later' is far
more frequent than the corresponding usage of ngamoo 'before' and yaningi
'now'. Whereas in (6-84) wamba 'later' provides a temporal location of the
situation, in (6-186), it is quite likely that the speaker is contradicting an
assumption that he will not be meeting the addressee later on.
6.4.14 wambawoo 'nearly'This particle occurs only with VPs in the potential mode, and indicates that
although the process did not actually occur, it very nearly did. For example,
(6-189) wambawoo gardyanirni
nearly
she:could:have:fallen
'She nearly fell.'
described a situation in which a woman tripped over on a stick and very nearly
fell over. Gardyanirni 'she could have fallen' itself could be used to describe the
same situation (see section 6.5.3.2 below); but wambawoo 'nearly' suggests that
the process very nearly occurred, and that there was a strong expectation that it
would. The presence of the particle disambiguates the utterance from other
possible interpretations of the potential mode (section 6.5.3.2). In (6-189) it was
only at the last moment that the woman regained her balance. In the following
example, the speaker had expected to hit the kangaroo, but it got up in time:niyi thiddoo bajgiwindi
(6-190) wambawoo gardgooloonirni
nearly
l:could:have:hit:it that kangaroo it:got:up
'I very nearly hit it, but the kangaroo got up.'
The phonological shape of this particle suggests that it might be analysed into
wamba 'later', plus the definite mode enclitic -woo DEF. That this is not entirely
improbable finds some support in the possible English gloss for (6-189) 'Still,ClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS513she could have fallen'. I cannot pursue the implications of this possibility here.6.4.15 yilba 'forever'This particle indicates that either the process will continue indefinitely on into
the future, or its effects will. For example, to illustrate the rust sense,
(6-191) warangjawingi yilba
I:might:sit
forever
'I'll be staying (here) for good.'
The second sense is illustrated in:yilba
(6-192) mangaddi gardbiddini
not
they:hit:him forever
'They didn't hit him for good (i.e. they didn't kill him).'
yilba
(6-193) thinga gajbinmi
foot
they:cut:him forever
'(The doctors) cut his toe right off.'
6.4.16 ngaddarni 'always•Ngaddarni 'always' indicates that the process referred to occurs habitually; it can
usually be translated into English 'always':
(6-194) gaddwaroo ngaddami bagingiri
afternoon always
I:lie
'I always sleep in the afternoon.'
In section 6.5.1.2 it is shown that one of the senses of the present tense is
general or habitual action. The function of ngaddarni 'always' seems to be to
bring prominence to this facet of the proposition expressed. Usually, the plain
present tense is used to indicate habituality. It seems that ngaddarni 'always' is
used only when there is an expectation to the contrary, an expectation that the
proposition may not be a universal truth. For example, in the context in which
(6-194) was elicited, there was an expectation that the speaker might be available
for an interview some afternoon. Thus it appears that ngaddarni 'always' is
fulfilling the interpersonal role of Propositional Modifier in examples like
(6-194).
The idea 'never' is not lexicalised in Gooniyan~i. but may be expressed by
placing a negated clause within the scope of ngaddarni 'always' (i.e. 'always not
P'):514TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(6-195) ngaddarni mangaddi bijbiyaniila
goomboorna

I:frequently:come early
'I never come early.'
6.4.17 ngambiddi 'again'Ngambiddi 'again' is a particle which can usually be glossed 'again'. It indicates
that the situation referred to by the clause is a repetition of an earlier situation;
formula (6-69) describes its meaning. Ngambiddi 'again' contrasts in a number of
interrelated ways with the enclitic -nyali REP, which may sometimes be glossed
'again' (see section 6.3.2):
(i) The particle is a clause level particle, and indicates the repetition of the
full situation, whereas -nyali REP indicates the repetition of part of a situation
only. There are no examples of the 'back to a former place or position' sense
with ngambiddi 'again'. In saying that the full situation is repeated, I do not
mean to suggest that it must be repeated in all its aspects. But, as a rule, the
same participants are involved in each instance. The only exception I am aware
of it when reference is made to a generic, not an individual participant, as in
(6-196) nganyi nyagginboowoo ngambiddi. -nyali
I
he:will:spear:me again
REP
'I might be speared again.'
(6-197) ngambiddi. -nyali wayandi jardli
again
REP fire
I:lit:it
'I lit a fire again.'
(ii) Unlike -nyali REP, ngambiddi 'again' appears never to have an
interpersonal sense in which the time T of formula (6-69) is speech situation
time.
(iii) Being a full word, ngambiddi 'again' may become either the Theme or
the Focus of a clause, possibilities denied to the enclitic -nyali REP. This
property is crucial in two contexts: where it is desired to indicate that a situation
will 'not occur again', and to indicate 'again not'.(6-198) mangaddi ngambiddi giddagiddayidi

'Then they ate meat, no longer under the taboo.'
(Cf. pages 387-388 above.) As shown by (6-198), -nyali REP never occurs
when ngambiddi 'again' is in the scope of mangaddi 'not' (cf. discussion of sense
(i) in section 6.3.2 above).6.4.18 briyandi •in revenge'
This adverbial indicates that the action was done in return for, or as revenge for,
some other action by a different actor. That is, the action was done to redress a
balance. Examples are (6-34) and (6-35) above. Occasionally briyandi 'in
revenge' is followed by the locative postposition -ya, in which case it indicates
that a number of successive events were done each in return for the preceding.
Examples are:
(6-200) briyandi -ya
boolooboowa
wardhinggiddi
in:revenge LOC you:will:follow:him you:will:go
'Set off, taking turns to follow one another.'
(6-201) nangbiddani briyandi -ya
they:died
in:revenge LOC
'They died in tum' (i.e. each in tum for the death of the other).","[493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499]"
"There is some evidence that when yiganyi 'uncertain' contains a clause in
the future potential in its scope, what is being asserted is that the potentiality of
the situation is not certain (given the surrounding conditions). The following
pair of examples lend support to this interpretation:
(6-269) yiganyi barnbingirni moolooddja -yidda
uncertain I:could:retum [name]
ALL
'I might return to Mulurrja (sc. if I can get someone to take me).'(6-270) ngaja
yiganyi bijboowarnirni wamba mangaddi
younger:brother uncertain he:could:emerge later
not
nganyi binaddi
I
knowledgeable
'My younger brother might come soon; I don't know.'(6-270) occurred in a context in which the potentiality of the speaker's brother's
arrival was uncertain. The speaker had not heard from his brother for some time,
and did not know what he had been doing, or the circumstances surrounding his
actions.
The potential mode seems to normally occur in assertions, and only rarely
in proposals. The only instances of the potential in proposals are of the irrealis
potential being used as a type of indirect post hoc command to the effect that the
addressee shouldn't do (again) something that s/he has done, or should do
something that s/he hasn't done. Thus:VERBAL CATEGORIES539(6-271) mangaddi jagjimirni
ngaddanyi -yoo
not
you:could:say mother
DAT
'You shouldn't talk to your mother (like that).'
(Compare (6-259) above.)6.5.3.3 Definite mode
The definite mode is realised by the enclitic -woo DEF, which, as has been
mentioned already, is not restricted to occurring in VPs. Definite mode occurs
with the three tenses past, present and future, but not, apparently, with the
irrealis. It indicates that the speaker evaluates and asserts the occurrence of the
situation - at a past, present, future or unspecified time - as definite or
certain. As was the case for the potential, this evaluation would appear to be
based on the speaker's assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and theirlikely outcome.
If the potential and desiderative modes are typically associated with
assertions and proposals respectively, the definite mode finds an unmarked
association with exclamations (see section 6.5.1.3 above). The defmite can occur
in exclamations with each of the three tenses. As distinct from, the expletive
type of exclamation mentioned earlier in connection with the unmodalised future
tense, these exclamations are of a type that draws attention to the occurrence of
the situation - just as occurs when -woo is encliticised to nominal
constituents, drawing attention to the existence of some entity or place (see
section 6.3.9). Examples in the three tenses are, respectively,
(6·272) gilbala
-woo
I:found:it DEF
'I found it!'
(6·273) thithi
goingwardngira -woo
I:go
DEF
'I'm going!'(6-274) nginyji wardbira
-woo
you
you:will:go DEF
'You can go!'
The definite mode occurs but rarely in combination with the past and future
tenses. The handful of examples of these combinations are all used as
exclamations, and little more can be said about the combinations. But there are
numerous examples of the combination with the present; this combination is540TOPICS 1N SEMANTICSnot restricted to exclamations and shows an interesting range of uses.
(a) Exclamations. Firstly, in exclamations, the speaker may draw
attention to a situation that is going on at the present time. Fo:t example,
(6-273) above COULD be uttered whilst the speaker is in motion. But more
usually, the situation is not one which has already started, but, rather, it is one
which is about to start (if it is an extendible), or about to occur (if it is an
accomplishment). Thus, a more likely circumstance in which (6-273) might be
uttered is just as the speaker is about to take his/her leave. And (6-275) refers to
an imminent accomplishment:
(6-275) gamba -ya
yimininyganoo -woo
water LOC he:drowns
DEF
'He'll drown in the water!'
(b) Assertions. A clause such as (6-275) (and probably also (6-273)) may
be uttered as an assertion, in which case the speaker merely states that theoccurrence is imminent. The present progressive - yimininygoowaani 'he is (in
the process of) drowning' - could be used to describe the same events (see
6.5.2). But it would not carry the same sense of urgency as (6-275), and would
probably be unlikely as an exclamation. Secondly, by comparison with the
'future time' sense of the plain present, the present definite suggests that the
situation is far closer to actualisation and threatens to occur. Furthermore, the
situation is usually seen as undesirable in some sense (as in (6-275), and see
also examples below).
When a clause in the present definite is negated, the speaker is normally
denying that the situation is about to occur, and thus, by suggestion, that the
Actor has any intention of doing the act - or in fact that there is any chance
that s/he will do it. For example,
(6-276) mangaddi wardgaddoo -woo
not
we:go
DEF
'We won't go', or 'We don't want to go.'
(6-277) mangaddi diribngira -woo mangaddi ngaddagi mayaroo
not
!:enter
DEF not
my
house
'I won't go in (there is no chance I'll go in); it's not my house. •
At first glance sentences such as these, which seem to strongly deny the
occurrence of the situation, would appear to involve a switch in meaning from the
expected 'not definite' to 'defmitely not'. However, to assume this would be to
confuse the type of definiteness of the Gooniyandi category with the meaning of
the English word definite. The defmiteness at stake here, as has been mentionedVERBAL CATEGORIES541above, is based on an evaluation of the circumstances: thus the preceding two
example sentences claim that the evaluation of the situations 'we are going' and 'I
am going inside' (respectively) as defmite - that they are imminent and threaten
to occur - is mistaken. These sentences do not claim that the non-occurrence of
the situation is inevitable or imminent. Thus it seems that the apparent strong
denial in (6-276) and (6-277) is illusory: rather, it is a strong claim that is being
denied.
This analysis is further strengthened by an example of a slightly different
type, which involves the generic sense, instead of the present time sense of the
present tense. The clause
(6-278) mangaddi milaa
-woo
not
he:sees:it DEF
was elicited in response to 'he doesn't see well'. It is evident that this clause does
NOT assert that the speaker evaluates the Actor as defmitely or certainly unable to
see anything. What is asserted is the negation of milaawoo 1 evaluate the facts as
indicating that he sees (anything)'. Clearly here it is the strong claim - that he
sees well (i.e. everything around) - that is being negated.","[519, 520, 521, 522]"

exception is that a dot under a vowel is used to indicate retroflection, and a dot

are represented in a practical orthography, which is described in section 1.8.
Words in other languages are written according to the accepted or recommended
orthography for that language if there is one, and otherwise according to the
spelling in the source.
Verbal classifiers arc cited throughout the text in capitals (e.g. +BINDI),
and are not usually glossed. Pronominal prefixes to the classifier are glossed asXXABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONSfollows: the person and number information is enclosed in brackets, and is
followed by a letter referring to the case form. Thus, (IR)N indicates the
nominative form of the first person restricted.
Function labels are given with an initial capital letter.
Example sentences normally consist of three parts: (a) Gooniyandi text; (b)
interlinear gloss; and (c) free translation.
(a) The Gooniyandi text is divided into distributional words, bounded by
spaces. Morpheme boundaries are not necessarily indicated, except for the
morphemes under discussion, or where relevant to the discussion. The first Jines
of example sentences are not punctuated. However, where relevant, suprasegmental features (e.g. tone units, salience, etc.) are indicated. Bolding indicates
that a syllable is salient.
(b) Interlinear glosses are unit by unit, each full unit distinguished in the
Gooniyandi line being glossed. Where more than one English word is required
for the gloss of a unit, the words are separated by a colon (:). For typographic
convenience, 'he' is used in the glosses instead of the more cumbersome 'he, she,
or it' (Gooniyandi does not make gender distinctions in its nominals and
pronominals).
(c) A free translation is given for each example. This is enclosed in quotes:
double quotes for translations provided by the speaker himself/herself, and single
quotes otherwise.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"CI.AUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS507(b) 'For no reason'. Moorda may suggest that the process referred to
occurred for no apparent reason. An example is (5-370) above. This sense may
also be enhanced by the use of winhi 'just, only' (in sense (d) of the previous
section):
gardnginbini
(6-174) winhi moorda
only no:reason you:hit:me
'You hit me for no reason at all.'
Winhi 'just, only' and moorda 'completely' have apparently similar senses 'for no
real reason'. However, the English glosses here in fact conflate two quite distinct
senses: 'to engage in an action just for the sake of it', and 'to become engaged in
an action for no apparent reason'. The first is a contextual sense of winhi 'just,
only' contradicting the expectation that an individual would not normally do the
action without some purpose in view; the second, a contextualisation of moorda
'completely', contradicting the implicit assumption that the process would not
occur unless the actor intended to engage in it. The former is less than
expectation; the latter, greater than expectation. This may explain the
combination of the two in (6-174): 'just (for the sake of it) you hit me for no
reason (or cause)'.(c) 'By accident'. A closely related sense to the one just discussed is that the
process was not done intentionally: it just happened. (This does not cover the
full range of 'unintentional' in English.) For example:
(6-175) mangaddi ngaoddi -yoo
moowla -nhi
moorda
not
stone
DAT I:looked for:it by:accident
gilbali
I: found: it
'Although I wasn't looking for money, I found some.'
It seems likely that a single formal meaning can be identified as underlying
these three senses. Moorda 'completely' would appear to be a type of expectation
modifier, which indicates that the situation referred to is evaluated as greater than
expectation (in the sense of evaluation identified above). That is, in the symbols
used above, Assertion x >Expectation y. Thus swallowing food whole may be
evaluated as greater than expectation if there is no apparent reason for it, or if the
actor does not try to do it.
Moorda 'completely' is then an inverse of winhi 'just, only', for which the
assertion is evaluated as less than the expectation. Furthermore, moorda
'completely' and the enclitic -ngaddaya TOO (see section 6.3.5) have identical
formal meanings, and differ only in scope: clausal vs. subclausal. For moorda
'completely', x andy in the formula of the previous paragraph are situations508TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(expressed linguistically in clauses), whereas for -ngaddaya TOO they are
participants or circumstances (expressed linguistically in nominal phrases and
adverbials). We can now set up the following proportion:winhi : moorda :: -moowa : -ngaddaya
6.4.9 wajanginyji and jinginyji 'but really'
Very little can be said about these two words, of which there are a couple of
instances only of each. In the few examples, wajanginyji and jinginyji have
approximate senses 'but really', and the clauses they modify follow clauses
modified by thaddi 'mistakenly believed', in a replacive clause complex (see
section 5.6.2.1). It is not clear, either, in what way the two lexemes differ
(assuming that they do differ). It proved impossible to systematically elicit
either word in this replacive construction: the contrast usually went unmarked as in example (6-146).
Examples of usage of the two particles are:-ngaddaya thaddi
manyi -yoo
(6-176) nginyji -ga
you
ERG TOO
mistakenly:believed food
DAT
moowya
grog -jinginyji moowya
you:looked
but:really you:looked
'I thought you too were looking for food, but really you were
looking for grog.'
migalimi -nganggi manyi -yoo
(6-177) thaddi
mistakenly:believed !:thought of:you food
DAT
moowya
wajanginyji grog -joo
moowya
you:looked but:really
DAT you:looked
'I thought you were looking for food, but it was really grog you
were looking for.'
6.4.10 ngamoo 'before'Ngamoo has a purely temporal meaning 'before, at an earlier time'. As has
already been mentioned, this word may fill one of two main roles in a clause:
Temporal Location, or Propositional Modifier.
In the former role, ngamoo 'before' can indicate past either with respect to
the speech situation (which is the usual state of affairs), or with respect to an
event set up in the text. Examples are, respectively,CLAUSEMODIFYJNG PARTICLES ANDADVERBIALS509(6-178) ngamoo yoowooloo -moowa warangbiddi
before man
ON
they:sat
'Before there were only Aborigines (here). •doowa
(6-179) manyi ngamoo giribali
food
before
I:was:finishing:it 00or
gardbigardbinga
-ngatk:Ja
he:knocked:repeatedly on:me
'I was just finishing up my tea when he knocked at my door.'
In its role as a Propositional Modifier, ngamoo 'before' normally translates
as 'already':
(6-180) ngamoo bijgoowayiddarni
before we:are:arriving
We're almost there.' (Literally, We're already arriving.')
This sentence may be used to contradict an expectation that we were not nearing
the destination, that is, an expectation that there was still a long way to go.
{6-180) was elicited as appropriate to a context in which the speaker contradicts
the hearer's belief that they still have some distance to travel. Here ngamoo
'before' modifies the proposition bijgoowayiddarni 'we're getting there', and
contrasts with mangaddi 'not', yiganyi 'uncertain', etc., not with other temporals
such asjamoondoo 'the other day', etc. {cf. section 5.4.1).
6.4.11 yaningi 'now'.
!","[490, 491, 492, 493]"
"Here the process of being away is accomplished well before the three days are
up; but it is not completed until the individual returns. Note that for some
classifiers, such as +BINDI and +I (where it replaces +BIND!) the progressive
can only refer to the preceding train. For others, such as +Ml, there is
sometimes a train of circumstances following the point of accomplishment,
from within which the reference point may be located. The verb dawoong- 'love,
like', for example, invariably occurs with the classifier +MI, and with the
progressive aspect when reference is being made to the ongoing process of liking
or loving someone or something: dawoonggoowaalimi means 'I like/love
him/her/it.'
In the past and future tenses the progressive aspect is not normally chosen
over the plain past or future - which are more informative, indicating that the
process actually did or will happen and became/become completed- unless it is
to temporally locate another process which occurred or will occur before the
situation is completed. Examples are (6-179) above andVERBAL CATEGORIES529(6-236) yaniyaningi lxun -goowa -ngi ngaddagi -ya riwi
right:now return PROG I:was my
LOC camp
yiwindi bijngarni -ngodda
rain
it:emerged on:me
'I was almost back at my camp when rain appeared.'
More generally, any temporal point may be located within the train of the
process. The present progressive of course occurs when that temporal point is
the time of the speech situation.
I have said that the progressive most frequently views an accomplishment
from within the 'train' of events leading up to the point of accomplishment. But
up until that point in time is reached, the process itself has not yet occurred; that
'train' is not an instantiation of the process. It is rather a set of circumstances
that are regarded as leading up to, even necessary preliminaries to, the occurrence
of the process; consequently, there is no specific or well defined extent to the
train, in general. Usually, however, the unmarked suggestion is that the
accomplishment of the process is imminent, given the situation. (Quite different
absolute times are involved in (6-233) and (6-234) with respect to (6-236).)
When the usual sense of the progressive is modified by mangaddi 'not', it
is claimed that not only didn't the situation occur, but it didn't even show signs
of occurring. Thus where the choice is available, the progressive has the effect of
strengthening the force of the negation. Thus, for example, the reply in (6-237)
is more forceful than it would have been if the plain past tense occurred:
(6-237) A: ngoonyi -ya yoodji
where
LOC you:put:it
B: mangaddi yoodgoowali
not
I:was:putting:it
A: 'Where did you put it?'
B: 'I haven't put it down.'
In negated clauses the progressive normally functions absolutely, not
relationally, as it usually does in positive clauses. (See discussion of example
(6-236).) Depending on what the speaker takes to be the extent of the train, there
are perhaps two major contextualisations.
(a) Not even an attempt was made to do the act. This sense arises in
contradicting expectations to the contrary (that the deed was attempted). For
example,TOPICS IN SEMANTICS530(6-238) ngoorloogloonayi ngambiddi mangaddi

"CHAPTER 6
TOPICS IN SEMANTICS
6.1 Preliminary remarksThis chapter is a preliminary investigation into the semantics of certain closed
class units, in particular, logical modifiers (section 6.2), enclitics (section 6.3),
particles (section 6.4), and the major categories of the finite verb (section 6.5).
Up to now these morphemes have been given approximate English glosses
only. Other closed class items including stem forming suffixes,
postpositions, pronominals, and infinitives- have already been discussed in
Chapter 3 above.
As in the previous chapters, the object of study is the linguistic sign, a
form-meaning correlation. Meaning, as we have seen (see page 323) must be
distinguished from reference, or the extra-linguistic ""reality"" referred to by a
particular utterance or sign in the utterance. Meaning and reference are not
identical; the former imposes a classification on the latter. On the other hand,
reference must be studied in order that linguistic meaning be determined. What is
different about the investigation of this chapter lies primarily in the nature of the
formal aspect of the sign. In Chapters 4 and 5 the forms were immediate
constituents of phrases and clauses - that is, entities with no unique shape in
terms of either their phonological or their lexical expression, and established by
means of contrast and complementary distribution. It is assumed in this chapter
that morphemes, the ultimate linguistic constituents which have meaning, arc
also signs. In this case, of course, the forms we are concerned with are primarily
(morpho)phonological. The sign is an association between a phonological and/or
a morphophonological form and a meaning. Qualifications must, of course, be
made regarding: (i) homophony, in which two distinct signs share a
phonological form; and (ii) allomorphy, in which a single sign has variant
phonological expressions.
The fundamental assumption of the approach to meaning adopted here is,
then, that each formal item or morpheme (with the exception of homonyms) has
associated with it a linguistic meaning which remains constant throughout all of450TOPICS IN SEMANTICSits uses. I will refer to this invariant of meaning as the FORMAL meaning of the
morpheme, following Ellis (1966:80). Other linguists have used terms such as
""core meaning"" (McConvell 1983a), ""grammatical meaning"" (King 1983), and
""common denominator of meaning"" or ""Gesamtbedeutung"" (Jak:obson 1936 and
Waugh 1975). This formal meaning must be distinguished from the various
CONTEXTUAL meanings or interpretations that the morpheme acquires in the
various circumstances of its use. Contextual meanings do not form a part of the
essential meaning carried by a form, and they vary according to its linguistic and
extra-linguistic environment. Of course, a given morpheme is always used in
some context, linguistic and extra-linguistic. And each context will engender a
particular semantic interpretation, which must not, however, be confused with
the meaning inherent in the morpheme, and common to all of its uses (cf.
Waugh 1975:439, and King 1983:113). In order to establish the formal meaning
of a morpheme, ALL of its uses must be examined, and from them a common
denominator of meaning extracted (if possible) on which the various uses are
based.
As King (1983:102) points out, many grammarians have been content to
delineate and catalogue the uses attributable to a particular form. There are,
however, a number of problems and inadequacies with this sort of approach to
semantic description (see King 1983: 103). From the perspective of the present
investigation, the major problem concerns the identification and delimitation of
these meanings. Nothing seems to prevent the proliferation of meanings as more
and more individual examples are taken into account: in this approach all
meanings are accorded equal footing. Furthermore, there is another problem for
the linguist who is not a native speaker of the language in establishing the
intended referential meaning of the utterance (or subpart thereof), and its
connotations. I have already discussed this problem in connection with the field
methodology (see section 1.10). It is clear from that discussion that the pairing
between the initial English prompts and the speaker's responses to them cannot
be regarded as unassailable 'raw' data. Even when the context constrains the
possible interpretations there may still be room for misunderstandings
(especially in the region of non-experiential meanings, which will take up a
significant part of the discussion of this chapter).
Thus the crucial problem with the cataloguing approach is that the only
means of cross-checking and assessing the presence (or absence) of a particular
sense is to elicit a native speaker's reaction and explanation. (And I have already
mentioned practical problems inherent in this methodology, at least in the field
situation where this research was conducted.) However, in the approach I amPREUMINARY REMARKS451advocating here, there is a constant interplay and exchange between the processes
of refining the specification of contextual meanings and encapsulating the formal
meanings. The complete meaning of an utterance or subpart of an utterance can
only be approached by degrees, and this may entail successive modifications to
the interpretation of particular examples, even in some cases the rejection of the
speaker's gloss as inappropriate or inaccurate. Furthermore, examples are not
seen in isolation from other like examples. Rather, by processes of crosschecking and comparison over as large a corpus as possible, significant
contextual meanings can be identified, and proliferation of meanings/uses
avoided. That is, we are more concerned with types of contextual meaning of a
form than with the instantiated and unrepealable meaning tokens in specific
utterances (cf. Ellis 1966:81).
But the establishment of formal meaning requires more than a mere
examination of contextual meanings. As a sign, a morpheme enters into
paradigmatic relations with other signs, and it is the system of such relations
that gives it linguistic 'value' (cf. Saussure 1959/1974:lllff). The formal
meaning of a morpheme cannot be fully determined without an appreciation of
the meanings of the other morphemes with which it enters into oppositions.
This means that minimal pairs and the principle of paradigmatic opposition
within fixed frames must be used in establishing formal meanings, in addition to
the process of abstraction of invariants from contextual meanings. A special case
of this is of importance to the study of a number of the forms dealt with in this
chapter. That is, the contrast between the presence and the absence of the form in
given contexts. Meaning is carried by the absence of a particular sign in a place
where it may occur, and zero in such contexts may also be regarded as a sign
belonging to the paradigmatic set including the former morpheme.
This account sets out to do more than merely assign English glosses to
Gooniyandi morphemes, which glosses are frequently misleading, and have
unintended connotations. An attempt is made to give sharp formulations (and
formalisations) of the formal meanings. This enterprise meets with varying
degrees of success and depth with the various morphemes discussed. The formal
meanings have, in a few instances, been described in terms of systems of feature
oppositions (cf. Waugh 1975, and King 1983). This has been done only for
morphemes which enter into paradigmatic sets, one member of which is
obligatorily chosen in all circumstances of a specified type- see sections 6.5.1
and 6.5.5. Elsewhere, formulae and short descriptions have been used.","[432, 433, 434, 435]"
"THE ClAUSE362Not every pause signifies the end of a tone unit, however. There may be pauses
in which the speaker is collecting his/her thoughts, which are followed by
material identified as being from the same tone unit, on the grounds that pitch is
relatively constant before and after the pause. Occasionally, too, two tone units
will occur in succession, with no intervening pause. For examples of tone units
see the texts in Appendix 1.
The tone units into which a text is divided typically do not correspond to
grammatical divisions into clauses or sentences. Quite often a single NP is
uttered in isolation, in a tone unit of its own, separate from the other
constituents of the clause to which it belongs. And the remaining constituents,
which need not correspond to any grammatical division of the clause, may fall
into a single tone unit. However, tone units are not distributed randomly across
the clauses of a text. As a rule, a clause consists of an integral number usually between one and five - of tone units, each of which contains an
integral number of clausal ICs. Tone units do not normally consist of parts of
two clauses, or parts of two phrases (unless they are discontinuous). Most
frequently, a clause will fall into either one or two tone units as illustrated in
example (5-206). Although maximal division as in (5-207) is possible, it israre.

DU
we:followed:itthinga Ifoot
'We two men followed the footprints.'
Rarely, a single tone unit consists of two full clauses.
This raises the question: If tone units don't correspond to grammatical
units, what do they represent? The answer proposed here is that tone units
represent the INFORMATION UNITS into which the speaker opts to divide his or
her utterance. Precisely this suggestion has been made by Halliday (1970) for
English, and subsequently by Kilham (1977) and Heath (1984) for the (unrelated)
Australian languages Wile Munkan and Nunggubuyu respectively. (See also
Grimes 1975.}
I am suggesting that tone units delimit information units into which the
speaker packages his message, each tone unit corresponding to a unit ofTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE363information, the amount of information s/he thinks the hearer can take in at one
time. Thus, Gooniyandi texts consist of sequences of units each of which carries
one ""piece"" or quantum of information. This raises the important but often
ignored question: What is information? Halliday (1985) has suggested that
""information ... is a process of interaction between what is already known or
predictable and what is new or unpredictable"". There are two problems with this
formulation. The first is that information units sometimes relate things which
are both new; the second is that it is not explained what types of things may be
associated together in this way.
A rather different view of the nature of information is held by writers such
as Fronek (1983), who claim that information can be presented only through
propositional structures, which means that information is a nexus between a
predicate and its arguments. Both Halliday and Fronek agree on one thing: that
information involves some son of nexus. It appears that this nexus may be of
one of the following three types:
(a) A propositional nexus, that is, the connection between a full predicate
and its arguments, expressed in a clause.
(b) An association between two entities, or an entity and an attribute.
(5-208) illustrates this:
(5-208) gamba joomoo laandi
up
water soakbagiri I ngaddanggaminhingi
it:liesfrom:dreamtimegamba/
water
'There's a soak up there, one with dreamtime associations.'
In the second information unit of this example, only a part of the nexus finds
linguistic expression; the other part occurs in the preceding unit. This
information COULD have been expressed clausally in a single tone unit - but
there is no reason to believe that the second information unit of this example is
an (elliptical) clause.
(c) An association between a linguistic constituent or its referent, and a
clausal or phrasal role. For instance, in (5-206), the first information unit
associated the person Ned Collins with the role of Agent, the rider of the horse.
Alternatively, and/or concurrently, the associated role may be the textual one of
theme.
The rate of injection of information in a text depends mainly on the
speaker's evaluation of how quickly the hearer can take it in - which is
presumably based on considerations of presumed familiarity with the subject364THE CLAUSEmatter, degree of interest in the subject matter, intelligence, etc. - and is
controlled by its division into information units (see Grimes 1975:297). It is
inversely proportional to the number of information units into which the text is
divided. (5-207) shows a very slow rate of information injection; it is much
quicker in (5-209), where the speaker is presenting an affectively loaded part of
the discourse, the point at which he finds a lost man.(5-209) nganyi joodoo -nyali wardngi niyi gilbali I
I
straight REP I:went him I:found:him
'I went straight up and found him.'
The rate of information delivery can be slowed right down by dividing a
particular message into two clauses and two information units. The first unit
will state the matter in its starkest terms, and this will be elaborated on in the
following unit. In this way, not only is the rate of information flow controlled,
but each aspect can be made prominent in a 'natural' way - that is, may be
made the unmarked Focus of information (see below) - without overloading
any message unit.(5-210) niyaji ralwiddayi I
boonbooloo ralwiddayi I
this they:two:plucked:it feather
they:two:plucked:it
They plucked it; they plucked its feathers.'
When a given clause consists of two or more tone/information units, it is
typically the case that one of the units can be identified as more central or
PRIMARY than the other unit(s), which will be referred to as SECONDARY
unit(s). The primary unit has a more prominent salient syllable, and an
intonation contour characterised by greater pitch movement. On the other hand, a
secondary unit normally has a slight rise in pitch on its final syllable when it
precedes the primary unit, but a low falling pitch contour (i.e. with a low initial
pitch) when it follows the primary. No matter what its position, the primary
unit does not have the slight rise of the type associated with an initial secondary.
I have attempted to show these features in examples (5-211) and (5-212)(=(5-208).","[345, 346, 347, 348]"
"The expected forms nganyi-yidda (I-ALL) and nganyi-yoo (1-DAT) do not occur.
However, this is the only context in which the oblique form may realise the
Entity function. If there is an intervening morpheme, such as a number marking
postposition, the nominative form occurs:
(3-77) ngidi-yooddoo -yoo gamba
we(R) DU

'He'll show it to us two.'binabinawangiddangiyi
he:will:show:it:to:us:twoFinally, the oblique form is found in what would appear to be a type of
circumstance, indicating that the Actor did the process alone, or by him/herself.
The clause may be transitive, intransitive, or reflexive/reciprocal.

If the pronominals in (3-78) and (3-80) were NP constituents it would beexpected that they might occur in construction with postpositions, indicating
their role in the clause. However, they never do (in the available examples), and
moreover they contrast with PPs such as yoowarni-ngga (one-ERG) 'by one' in
(3-81). Contrast this with (3-78) above.
(3-81) yoowarni -ngga ngoorloogla

ERG I:drank:it
'I drank it alone.'
In this respect the oblique forms resemble adverbials, and an alternative
(perhaps equally valid) parts-of-speech classification might place the nominative
pronominals in the class on nominals, and the oblique and emphatic
pronominals in the adverbial class.
The forms I have labeled emphatic are used very similarly to the 'adverbial'
function of the oblique just discussed, but seem to be somewhat stronger,
indicating that not only did the Actor act alone, or as a unified group, but
he/she/they did so for his/her/their own benefit:

3.7 Postpositions
3.7.1 Preliminary remarks
The postpositions form a small class of non-ranking form units which enter into
constituency with noun phrases, forming postpositional phrases. They are
bound, phrase-level morphemes which typically occur one per phrase, and
attached to any word in the phrase, regardless of its position or role (see section
4.2 below).
Gooniyandi has fourteen postpositions. These may be divided initially into
two groups, as shown below:TIIEWORD174Number markingCase marking
-ngga
-yoo- -woo
-ya
-nhingi
-yangga

ALL(ative)4
PER(Iative)
COMIT(ative)
DEP(rivative)-yooddoo - yiddi
-yarndiDU(al)
PL(ural)This classification is primarily semantic, although there is at least one
formal correlate: the number markers appear to be distributionally restricted to
nominals, whilst the case markers may also occur on adverbials (see page 140
above). The two members of the second column indicate a property of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached, namely its number- and hence their
label ""number marking"" postpositions. The postpositions in the first column,
on the other hand, do not indicate any property of quality of the referent of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached. Rather, they relate that referent to
something else. I have labeled these as ""case marking"" postpositions because
they express a range of functions that are covered by case-suffixes in many
Australian languages (we will.be returning to this point shortly, and later again
in section 42).
Most Australian languages have a set of suffixes comparable with those
laid out above for Gooniyandi (see Dixon 1980:293-301, 322-326). Most
grammars, however, classify the suffixes quite differently. It is customary to
distinguish between case suffixes and derivational suffixes. The former are
inflectional, and give rise to different forms of a single word appropriate to
different syntactic environments, while the latter are non-inflectional, and
produce new lexemes from other lexical items to which they are attached (Dixon
1980:293, 323; see also Huddleston 1984:25). In section 4.2 it is shown that
none of the morphemes listed above are inflections; it can also be demonstrated
that none are derivational suffixes.
Grammars of Australian languages usually treat the comitative, and the
number markers as derivational suffixes (Dixon 1980:324-325). It is easy toPOSTPOSIDONS175show that the number markers are not derivational: they indicate the number of
the whole phrase, not the word to which they are attached (see page 278 below).
The comitative postposition is not a derivational morpheme, since it regularly
attaches to a full NP (as in example (4-80)), and there is no evidence that the
constituent that it attaches to becomes a new lexical item. These same reasons,
show that none of the remaining postpositions are derivational suffixes.
The comitative, though not the dual and plural markers, do, it is true,
occasionally have derivational uses. But this occasional use stands in contrast
with the productive uses of this morpheme as a case marking postposition (see
section 3.7.2.9 below). It might also be noted on the one hand that the
morphemes which I have classified as stem forming suffixes ALWAYS
functional derivationally, and on the other, that -nhingi ABLlt as well as
possibly -ngga ERG and -binyi PER also on occasions form new lexical items
from the one to which they are attached.
I refer to the morphemes in the left hand column above as case marking
postpositions because they fulfil functions which are associated with case
inflections in many languages, including many Australian languages - they
indicate the function of the phrase in the unit of which it is a constituent (cf.
Dixon 1980:292). However, this should not obscure the important difference
that in Gooniyandi the case markers do not form inflectional variants of a
lexeme (see section 4.2 for further discussion of this issue).
One important consequence of this difference is that, unlike most
Australianist grammarians, I do not identify a zero-marked absolutive case,
which contrasts with the ergative. There are a number of reasons for this
descriptive strategy. Firstly, it would imply a postposition which had an
invariant zero form. Whilst it is possible to maintain such a notion, there is
simply no evidence in the language which lends support to it. (To argue this
would be tantamount to arguing that subject NPs in English were in fact
prepositional phrases with a zero preposition.) Indeed, what evidence there is
leads us to reject the idea: to maintain that there were a zero postposition would
imply that the zero marked unit were an exocentric construction; this is in fact
false. Secondly, zero marking does not signal anything in itself, but the absence
of other meanings. Thirdly, no significant semantic or syntactic generalisation
arises under the zero postposition hypothesis.
All but four of these postpositions show phonologically conditioned
allomorphic alternations, as follows:
(i) -ngga ERG. This postposition is affected by two sandhi rules. One is rule
R9, by which -ngga dissimilates to-ga following a vowel that is preceded by a1761HEWORDnasal-stop sequence (see examples on page 98 above). The other is rule R9,
which inserts an epenthetic /i/ when the root ends with the velar nasal. For
example, gooddanggooddang-ingga (diverbird-ERG) 'by the diverbird'.
(ii) {y} initial postpositions. Nine of the postpositions have an initial f y}. Inaccordance with rule R6 of section 2.4.2.3.1, this initial segment hardens to /j/
following non-continuant consonants. Few Gooniyandi nominals end in
consonants, and in most cases the form of the postposition with initial /j/ is
attested only when the nominal is a borrowing from English, or when the
postposition is attached to a verbal root with a final stop or nasal (see below).
Examples illustrating the hardening process are: Jag-joo (Jack-OAT) 'for Jack',
babligaj-jaljanggal-jiddal-jayil-jayoo!-jawoo (pub-LOC/ABJ..dALLtfALLjALL:J
ALL4) 'at/from/to the pub', goorij-jangga (hold-AB~ 'from holding', and Dayibjooddoot-jarndi (Dave-DU/PL) 'a pair/group including Dave'.
(iii) -woo DAT. The verb specific allomorph -woo of the dative postposition issubject to VR6, the effect of which is to harden the initial ( w} to /g/ when
following a non-continuant, as for instance in gaj-goo (cut-DAT) 'for cutting'
and ngarag-goo (make-DAT) 'for making'.
The -yooddoo- -yiddi allomorphy is not phonologically conditioned. The
choice seems to be a matter of speaker's preference: some speakers use the
former, while others prefer the latter. (Today at least, the two forms do not
appear to be dialectal variants associated with distinct regions.)
In addition to occurring in constituency with NPs, some postpositions also
occur in constituency with PPs, adverbials and/or non-finite clauses. The first
possibility gives rise to sequences of postpositions, since the postpositions
from each PP are typically attached to the same d-word. Only a small subset of
the sequences that COULD occur actually DO occur. The first member of any
postposition sequence must be one of -nhingi ABLI> -ngaddi COMIT, -binyi
PER, -yooddoo DU, or -yarndi PL. Of these, the number markers -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL can be follow~ by any other postposition (note also that they are
always flrst in a postposition sequence). The remaining three, the case markers,
may be followed by the ergative -ngga only.
Postposition sequences may also arise when a PP is embedded as a constituent of
an NP which is itself embedded in a PP. No new sequences arise in this way.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"

"(3) Quite frequently phrasal reference to the participant does not occur: within
continuous texts, it is not unusual for clauses to consist of a VP only, or of a
VP together with phrases and words which refer to non-participant entities,
qualities, etc. (see section 5.3.1 below). Even in ""isolation"" it is common for
the clause to occur without phrasal reference to its participants. This is
especially true for first and second person participants. Speakers do not normally
refer to them by free pronominal forms (which, referentially, are redundant in
such clauses) in elicited sentences, and seem to regard their use in this context as
pedantic.
A VP on its own, that is, constitutes in general a fully 'grammatical'
clause capable of independent occurrence. (It will generally translate into an
English sentence involving pronominals; occasionally they are not quite this
specific.) I assume that these clauses, though 'grammatical', are incomplete, and
that their inherent. participant roles have not been ellipsed.3 The alternative to
this, that the participant roles are not clausal but phrasal (i.e.. VP) roles runs
3 It follows that although a clause is as a rule 'replaceable' by its VP, it is not an
endocentric construction with the VP as its head. Compare Matthews (1981: 148149), Robins (1964:235), and cf. Blake (1983:145, 163).",[304]

(6-161) minyjidda waddamba bijngarni

There is a verbal form minyjiddan- 'believe, take notice of, which is
clearly built on minyjidda 'true' (the final -n is a (perhaps meaningless- but cf.
McGregor forthcoming-d) formative. Examples:

6.4.7 winhi 'just, only'This particle is an expectation modifier which usually translates into English as
'just, only'. (Native speakers, however, preferred to gloss it najing 'nothing' in
their variety of Aboriginal English or Kriol.) It is a clause level counterpart of
the enclitic -moowa 'only, just' (discussed in section 6.3.3), from which it
differs in terms of scope. Whereas the latter modifies speaker's expectations as to
what will fulfil particular roles in the situations referred to, and contains within
its scope constituents of clauses, winhi 'just, only' modifies expectations as to
what situation will occur, and contains full clauses in its scope. Compare for
example, the following pair:504TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(6-164) winhi wardngi thanganuli -yoo
just I:went
wml
DAT
'I only went for a talk.'
(6-165) wardngi thangarndi -yoo -moowa
I:went word
DAT ON
'I went only for a talk.'
In the first example there is an expectation that I might have done something
else; in the second, the expectation is that I might have had some other purpose
in mind in going than just to talk.
The same formula as was invoked in describing -moowa 'only, just'
(section 6.3.3), Assertion x <Expectation y, accounts for the meaning of winhi
'just, only'. Here x andy are different, however: they are situations, rather than
participants or manners, etc .. That is, winhi 'just, only' evaluates the situation
asserted as occurring as 'less than' the situation expected to occur. Only the
scalar sense (see above page 475) of 'less than' is possible here; the subset
reading clearly cannot apply. Depending on the way the relation 'is less than' is
understood, winhi 'just, only' may contextualise in a few different ways, at least
from an Anglo-centric perspective.
(a) The occurring situation may be evaluated as less potent in some sense
than the expected situation. Thus:winhi milayiddarni
(6-166) mangaddi jijaggiddarni
not
we:talk:together only we:look:at:one:another
We're not talking together; we're only looking at one another.'
(Here of course the second clause replaces the first (see section 5.6.2.1). The
expectation that we might be interacting in some way, such as talking is created
by the larger context (e.g. of culture), and obviously not by the immediately
preceding clause. This remark applies to the following, and a number of other
examples.)
In this sense, winhi 'just, only' is frequently followed by the enclitic
-moowa 'only', which perhaps intensifies its effect:
(6-167) wambawoo gardnginbinirni
winhi -moowa
nearly
he:might:have:hit:me only
ON
madnginmi
he:swiped:at:me
'He tried to hit me, but only swiped me.'
(b) In a very closely related sense, the evaluation is not so much on a scaleClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVBRBIALS505of 'potence', but of the DEGREE to which the situation affects an undergoer. In
the following example, the person referred to is asserted as not being as sick as
might have been expected:nyamani winhi yalijmi
(6-168) mangaddi gambi
not
sickness big
only he:is:sick
'He's not very sick, just a little off-colour.'
Clearly this sense merges in with (a).
(c) The asserted occurrence may be evaluated as less than expectation
because the actor is not serious in his engagement in the process. For example,
(6-169) winhi rooddijginya
mangaddi minyjidda
only I:am:yelling:at:you not
true
'I'm just yelling at you, not seriously.'
(d) The evaluation may rest on an expectation of responsibility of the actor
- that s/he acts with purpose or intent. In this case, the use of winhi 'just,
only' suggests that the action was done without reason.winhi
(6-170) yaabja yoowooloo wardjawooddoo -nhi
some man
they:may:go
to:him only
wirdinboowoo
he: bites: him!
'Should any man go past (the dog). he'll bite him (for no reason in
particular).' (This describes a vicious dog.)
Winhi 'just, only' often occurs in responses to information questions,
where the effect seems to be to counter presuppositions implicit in the question.
(Cf. similar uses of mangaddi 'not' and marlami 'not' mentioned in sections
6.4.1 and 6.4.2 respectively.)

A: 'What are you lot doing to the children?'
B: 'Nothing much. We're washing them.'
Cf. Goody's (1978) suggestion that pure information questions, which do not at
the same time challenge the addressee, either by the presupposed right of the506TOPICS IN SEMANTICSspeaker to ask the question, or the presuppositions of the question itself, occur
but rarely (and only amongst social'equals'). And indeed, (6-171) could hardly
have been intended as a pure information question. It was part of an elicited
dialogue (in which the speaker took on both sides) that might occur between a
man and a group of women and children who were bathing in the river. Even if
not intended in this way, such a question would most likely be seen as a
challenge to the addressees. The effect of use of winhi 'just, only' here appears to
be to counter an apparent presupposition or expectation that something untoward
was being done to, or happening to the children.
McConvell (1983a) discusses a particle jupu 'only, just' in Gurindji which
has an almost identical range of contextualisations as winhi 'just, only'. The one
sense of the Gurindji jupu 'only, just' that does not appear to occur for the
Gooniyandi winhi 'just, only' is 'for a little while' - this may be because
Gooniyandi has a separate temporal adverbial janggoo which carries this
meaning. Similarly, winhi 'just, only' does not frequently occur in sense (c),
since there is a separate adverbial woongooloo 'for fun, for no particular purpose'
which is normally used to cover this sense. (It would appear that the Gurindji
jupu 'only, just' occurs more regularly in this sense.) The two frequently occur
together, as in
(6-172) winhi woongooloo gardbiyiddorni
only for:fun
we:fight:together
'We're just fighting for fun (with no serious intent).'
This was elicited as an appropriate response to jaji-yoo gardbinggiddarni
(something-OAT you:lot:are:fighting) 'Why are you lot fighting?'.
6.4.8 moorda 'completely'
Due to the paucity of examples, it is impossible to be certain of the exact
significance of this particle. The available examples show three main contextual
senses.
(a) 'Whole, completely'. This sense normally occurs with reference to
swallowing something whole, without chewing:
(6-173) gambayi -ngga
boy
ERGmaa mangaddi binyjangnga moorda

'The boy didn't chew the meat, he swallowed it whole.'","[487, 488, 489, 490]"

(1985:71). Here the speaker proposes, rather than asserts, the propositional
content of the clause. This proposal amounts to a suggestion that the
propositional content should be true, thereby offering his assurance that it will
be true (i.e. the speaker proposes to effect the necessary actions), or
requests/demands that the addressee make the propositional content true (by
effecting the necessary actions).
There is another 'speech-act' type in which the clause is used neither to
convey information nor to exchange goods and services: EXCLAMATIONS.
Again, they have no distinctive formal properties, although, as for ""questions"",
there is an enclitic, namely -woo DEF which means roughly 'defmitely, exactly',
which frequently occurs in this speech act type. For examples, see section 6.3.9
and section 6.5.3.3.
All situation and non-situation clauses may be used in the exchange of
information, i.e. in assertions. A proper subset of these may also be used in
proposals. For example, characterising and identifying relational (non-situation)
clauses do not occur as proposals, although existential clauses may - see
example (5-33) above; nor, at least in the present corpus, do situation clauses
whose VPs are in the past tense.
From the point of view of its propositional content, a major clause
consists of an obligatory Proposition, and an optional Propositional Modifier.
The 'simple' Proposition is realised by a clause consisting of the following
types of unit: NP, PP, VP, and/or ADV. (That is, the 'simple' Proposition is
that part of the clause which in experiential tenns refers to a situation or a384THE CLAUSErelationship.) Thus, for example, a 'simple' clause such as
(5-246) nganyi -ngga manyi wanJJa
I
ERG food I:brought:it
'I brought food.'
consists of the Proposition nganyingga manyi wardla 'I brought food'. A
Propositional Modifier may be realised by a particle or an adverbial. A clause
such as
(5-247) mangaddi gilbawidi
banda
not
they:found:it dirt
'They didn't fmd (any) dirt.'
has constituency structure
Propositional ModifierProposition[mangaddl1[gilbawidinotthey:found:it dirtOOnda]In the identification of the two constituents, the Proposition and the
Propositional Modifier, the clause is being viewed from the perspective of its
role as an interactive event in the speech situation. That is, the Proposition and
the Propositional Modifier are interpersonal roles in the clause. This follows
from the fact that the propositional content of the clause is that which
contextualises as an assertion, a proposal, or an exclamation, within the speech
situation it occurs in. It is that aspect of the meaning of the clause exchanged
between the speaker and the hearer. The role of Propositional Modifier is thus a
modal one, indicating some sort of qualification of the Proposition.
There appear to be three main ways in which the proposition expressed by
a clause may be modified: (a) objective, in which the 'logical' status of the
proposition is modified; (b) subjective, in which the speaker's attitude towards
the logical status of the proposition is indicated; and (c) expectation
modification, in which the proposition is placed within the expectations of the
interlocutors. Table 5-1 sets out the main lexemes functioning in these three
types of propositional modification.","[367, 368]"
"CLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS489This construction, in which the negated quality is followed by a positive term of
the same sense, seems to indicate an intensification of the quality or quantity,
much as English 'very' (which has no counterpart in Gooniyandi).
It might be suggested that mangaddi x can be accounted for as an elliptical clause,
as was suggested above (section 5.4.1) for similar examples with non-scalars.
Against this hypothesis is the fact that in this use mangaddi x is invariably
followed by the corresponding positive, and the two would appear to form a type
of correlative construction. Contrast example (5-255), where the correlation would
seem to be with the preceding clause.","[472, 473]"

(ix) The speaker believed at an earlier time that the situation would occur,
though it turned out not to. (And this belief was founded on evidence.) In this
case, thaddi 'mistakenly believed' can occur with the irrealis potential. See
section 6.4.4 for examples.
I do not claim that these nine senses have linguistic significance as covert
categories, and they are clearly not disjoint. There are, no doubt, many more
contextualisations of this category that have not yet appeared in the corpus.
They are all specific contextualisations of the general meaning that the process
was a potentiality. The specific contextualisations, however, are likely to be of
more significance to the interlocutors than this abstract core meaning - and not
all senses are glossed by native speakers in the same way.
The ·potential mode has, as has been mentioned already, the full situation
referred to by the clause in its scope, not just the Process (referred to by the VP).
But when the clause is modified by a Propositional Modifier, the potential is
contained within the scope of that Modifier. In particular, the potential is
contained within the scope of mangaddi 'no, not' in negated clauses. A negated
potential clause is consistent with both the occurrence and the non-uccurrence of
the situation - since a clause in the potential logically implies the negation of
the clause in the past tense: i.e. the situation did not occur. Depending on which
of these obtainst whether the situation occurred or did not occur, the potential
mode in negated clauses has two distinct sets of contextual senses.
(A) In case the situation occurred, a potential clause may be negated to
indicate that although it occurred, the situation was not evaluated as a
potentiality in the circumstances. There are three major reasons why the actual
might not be evaluated as potential:
(A-i) The Actor did not attempt to do it; s/he did it unintentionally,
without trying. For example,
(6-258) mangaddi niyi-binyi wardyirni

'He didn't mean to go that way (i.e. to step on the glass); (but) he
fell (on it).'","[515, 516]"
"SPEECH STYLES19Nominal roots generally have the same meaning as their everyday
counterparts. For example, the avoidance nominal ngarloomaii 'spear'
corresponds to the ordinary generic term for spear,jinali, including in its range
precisely the same subtypes. On those occasions when I requested an avoidance
equivalent for a more specific type of spear, I was invariably given the ordinary
term. The response was invariably the same when I requested other specific
terms, and I could detect no tendency to extend the range of an avoidance
nominal beyond the range of its corresponding ordinary term. It thus appears that
avoidance nominals have exact, or nearly exact, ordinary equivalents, and can not
be used to effect higher order taxonomic groupings than those which are a1rcady
made in the ordinary language (cf. Dixon 1972:292ff).
A few closed class grammatical items also have distinct avoidance terms.
For example, there is a particle woomoorla 'no, not, nothing, without', which
corresponds to the particle mar/ami 'not, nothing, without' of the everyday style,
and perhaps also to mangaddi 'no, not' (sec page 496 below); there is also a
nominal yawinhingi 'some, other' corresponding to the everyday terms yaanya
'other' and yaabja 'some'. At least in the latter instance, a distinction made in the
everyday vocabulary is neutralised in the avoidance vocabulary.
It will come a<> no surprise that in Gooniyandi avoidance speech, as in the
Bunuba variety (Rumsey 1982a), not every word in an utterance need be- or
even could be - an avoidance word. Often only a single word in an utterance
marks it as avoidance speech, whether or not other ordinary words COULD BE
replaced by avoidance terms. Indeed, a single feature, such as use of a non·
singular free pronoun, pronominal enclitic or prefix wit11 singular reference, may
even suffice.
Strategies of language use differ between avoidance spct>.Ch and everyday
speech. There are differences in: (I) modes of address and reference; (2) frequency
of propositional modification; and (3) degree of precision of expression.
(1) A man was of course not supposed to address his actual WM; nor could
he utter her name, or a close homonym. Reference to her could be oblique (e.g.
by using the term moonga 'dark'}, by use of a marked or triangular kin-tenn (e.g.
manaroo '(your) mother', speaking toW or WB), or by use of the third person
non-singular pronominal bidi 'they'. Other maddiyali, with whom speech was
permitted, were addressed with the second person non-singular pronominal gidi,
instead of the singular form nginyji. S/he would be referred to by means of the
third person plural bidi if the relationship was a close one, but otherwise more
frequently by the singular niyi; and the first person unrestricted yaadi 'we three or
more inclusive' would be used instead of ngidi 'we two, we exclusive' (seeINTRODUCTION20· 3 .6) m

speech, presumably with the intended effect of softening the force of the

(3) Avoidance speech is characteristically vaguer in expression than is
ordinary speech (Rumsey 1982a:l73, McConvell 1982:97), and this vagueness
is iconic of the relation of avoidance or lack of intimacy which it t~nccxles.
Although an avoidance verb is typically vaguer than an ordinary one, much of
the potential ambiguity is resolved once the context is ta.ken into account. For
example, in
(1-1) malab -migooddgoo
make he:effected:it hole
'He dug a hole.'it is quite clear that the intended sense of malab- 'make, construct' is 'dig'. It
should be noted that potential ambiguities are rarely if ever rcsolvctl by
paraphrase in actual texts (cf. Dixon 1972:293). And I suspect that this is partly
because in real terms the ambiguity of a contextualised utterance is usually
relatively small, and far less than the potential ambiguity, and partly because
vagueness is an inherent semantic characteristic, and not just a formal fc.altlrc of
the avoidance style.","[31, 32, 33]"

THE CLAUSE5.1 Introductory remarks
This chapter investigates the structure and semantics of the Gooniyandi clause,
which as mentioned in section 3.1.1, is the highest ranking grammatical unit in
the language.
The internal constituency structure of the clause is analysed in sections 5.2
to 5.4. Clauses are realised as syntagms of units which may be of phrase rank
(that is, units of the types identified in the preceding chapters, NPs, PPs and
VPs); or by non-ranking morphemes, adverbials and particles (section 3.1.2); or
complexes of ranking and non-ranking units (as described in 4.3.1 and 4.3.2
above). However, as is the case for NPs (see section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.1), a
description of clauses in terms of the classes of the constituent units and their
linear sequences does not take us very far. It is impossible to provide a general
description of the clause in these terms alone; the functions of the units within
the units of which they are immediate constituents (in this case clauses) must be
taken into account (cf. page 253 above).
As argued in section 3.1.1, constituents are linguistic signs, and to each
constituent form is associated a function, its role in the unit of which it is an
immediate constituent. It seems that, as Halliday has suggested is the case in
English (cf. e.g. Halliday 1970 and 1985), there are in Gooniyandi three primary
types of function that a clausal constituent may bear, each of which conttibutes
a distinct constituency structure to the clause. These primary functions, or
metafunctions, are the ideational, textual and interpersonal (Halliday 1985:xiii).
(a) The IDEATIONAL meaning of a linguistic element is its expression of
""content"". This type of meaning is of two types. One relates to the
representation of the world of experience, including phenomena in it; this is
EXPERIENTIAL meaning. The other concerns the 'logical' relations that are
imputed to lie between these referent phenomena, or the propositions, or parts of
propositions, that express them; this is LOGICAL meaning. Experiential
· meaning of the clause is discussed in section 5.2.",[275]
"···PARTS-OF-SPEECH137be able to occur in most of the environments in which yoowooloo 'man' occurs,
and certainly always in the first two. Restrictions are generally attributable to
semantic and cultural factors. For example, many words that are notionally
nouns have not been encountered in contexts like (3-9); the reason for this is
obvious: people don't normally address ants, water, trees, etc.. But these are
semantic (or pragmatic), and not grammatical restrictions, and it is easy to
invent contexts in which addressing ants or trees would not seem too unnatural
-in fact, I have a short piece of text in which the speaker addresses a particular
tree of mythical significance. On the other hand, there are lexical roots that occur
only in a subset of these environments, not including the first two, and yet other
lexemes occurring in complementary environments. Thus, even though lexemes
are multifunctional, it is possible to identify classes by occurrence in common
ranges of syntagmatic environments.
In these respects Gooniyandi would appear to be intermediate between
English and what is reportedly the norm for Australian languages. According to
Dixon (1980:271), in the majority of Australian languages lexical roots belong
to disjoint classes which are defined by occurrence in specified syntagmatic
environments. In Gooniyandi, classes defined in this way overlap considerably:
as in English, as we have seen, a single word-form can usually occur in a variety
of syntagmatic contexts. But Gooniyandi is unlike English which has a large
number of pairs like dog (noun) vs. dog (verb), bottle (noun) vs. bottle (verb),
etc., where the meaning differences are not fully predictable, thus making it
necessary for the dictionary maker to provide separate definitions for each distinct
context of occurrence. In Gooniyandi the differences of meaning are as a rule
completely predictable, and one dictionary definition will suffice.
This is not to deny the existence of homophony in Gooniyandi. As far as I
have been able to determine, however, there are very few homophones. The only
convincing examples I have been able to find are doowa 'store' and doowa 'he
gets it'; and nginyji 'you', nginyji 'certainly, indeed' and -nginyji, a form of the
classifier +DI which refers to the action of a first person singular agent on a
second person singular patient (see below section 3.9.3.2).
Most examples which at first appear to be homophones turn out on closer
examination to be single lexemes whose variant senses can be explained as
contextualisations of a single basic meaning. Consider, for example, widdijwhich translates both 'dig (a hole)' and 'scratch'; yiniga which translates as both
'how, in what manner' and 'say or do something'; miga which translates 'that
way' and 'tell, say, think'; and yiganyi which corresponds sometimes to 'maybe,
perhaps' and sometimes to 'sneakingly'. For each of these four phonemic forms IiI
I!t
~THE WORD138have given two or three approximate English glosses. based on the native
speakers' glosses in various examples. Across a large number of examples
(consisting of Gooniyandi-English translation ""equivalents"") the glosses given
for the words fall into the two or three distinct English expressions as indicated
above. It seems likely, however, that these senses are not as unrelated as the
glosses would immediately suggest to the English speaker, and that each form is
a single Iexeme having a single basic meaning. Very approximately, widdijmeans 'scrape a surface with a relatively sharp or elongated instrument'; yiniga
means 'what or some manner of action'; miga means 'this manner of action'; and
yiganyi means 'uncertain, unsure' (where cultural factors determine what
constitutes lack of assurance).
The major parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi are set out in Table 3-1 below.
Each lexical word/morpheme can be uniquely assigned to a class.

"THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATIONII359the VP, the situation obtained when (perhaps as a consequence ot) the quality
was attained. In the reverse order, the quality was evident when the situation
occurred. ((5-189) is only apparently a counterexample. The immediately
preceding clause was mangaddi gilbaali (not I:fmished:it) 'I didn't fmish it'thus the meaning intended was that I left it when it was in the condition of
being half done, not that when I left it it was (evidently) half done.)
Instead of indicating a quality obtaining throughout a situation, a
Conditional attribute may indicate an initial quality or state which obtained
when the situation first took place, but which no longer holds. In this case, the
attribute is realised by an ABL PP. For example,
(5-195) giljiddijgi -nhingi goornagjawani woogoo bagiyawi
tadpole
ABL it:will:tum
frog
it:will:lie
From a tadpole it will tum into a frog.'
With extendible processes (see page 195 above), the suggestion is that the
situation holds for all subsequent states or qualities of the entity. Thus:
(5-196) mawoolyi -nhingi -ngga waddgoomjawoodda
children
ABL
ERG they:want:to:work
'They want to work from children.'
(5-197) mawoolyi ngirndaji binaddigmiwiddra lambalambardi -nhingi

ABL
We want to teach these children from little ones.'
(d) Capacity attributes. These indicate the role of the participant as s/he
enacts the situation; these are illustrated in the following examples:(5-198) ngooddoo waddgoomgiri doogman
that

'That man works as a stockman.'

!.:I360..,,'THE CLAUSE[2] Circumstantial attributes. In situation clauses other than clauses of
being, the only circumstantial attributes are Locational. These ascribe a location
to the Medium (typically a Goal) as it is involved in the situation; they do not
locate the entire situation. Locational attributes usually occur in clauses of
transfer and holding. For example,
(5-201) gamba galinyjawila bagad -ja
water I:will:carry:it bucket LOC
'I'll carry the water in a bucket.'
(5-202) goorijgila marla -ya
I:hold:it hand LOC
1'm holding it in my hand.'
(5-203) manyi midda -ya
thiddangga
food hem LOC she:carries:it:on:her:head
'She carries the food on her head.'
In examples such as these, the LOC PP locates the Medium/Goal only, not the
whole situation. The PP always refers to a relatively small object at, in or on
which the Medium/Goal is located.
The locational phrase that occurs with the verb yood- 'put' in (5-204)
would also seem to be an attribute:
(5-204) ngaaddi yoodjingi gilirni -yarock
he:put:it grass LOC
'He put the money in the grass.'
This verb also occurs with a locational expression that locates the full process of
putting, such as birndiddi-ya (plain-LOC) 'on the plain', which would appear to
be a Locational circumstance.
5.3 Some aspects of the textual organisation of the Gooniyandi
clause
5.3.1 InformationTwo major aspects of the textual organisation of Gooniyandi utterances are
distinguished, following Halliday's suggestions for English. They are: (i)
INFORMATION, which is concerned with the given/new opposition; and (ii)
1HEMATISATION, which is concerned with the theme/rheme (or topic/comment)
opposition (Halliday 1967, 1970, and 1985). Information and thematisation
impose distinct and independent structures on utterances. As in Englisht
I~]·. :. ~cTHE TEXTIJAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE361information structure in Gooniyandi is expressed primarily prosodically, by
intonation features, and the thematic structure is realised through constituent
order. This section is concerned with information; thematisation is discussed in
the following section.
As has already been remarked, Gooniyandi discourse is highly elliptical. As
a rule, given or retrievable information is ellipsed. There are few restrictions on
either the word/morpheme class of elements that may be ellipsed, or on their
experiential role in the clause. The only exceptions are propositional modifiers
such as mangaddi 'no, not', yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed';
these particles are never ellipsed. There are, however, some striking differences
in the types of constituent that tend to be ellipsed depending on the generic type
of the text. In narrative texts of the type investigated for the purpose of this
description (see section 1.10), ellipsis of nominal expressions is rife, but verbal
complexes are almost never ellipsed. Expressions referring to the main
participants in a clause are particularly prone to being ellipsed, since they are
cross-referenced by bound pronominals in the verb - cross-referencing often
provides sufficient information about the participant to allow it to be identified.
A count over the fifteen texts investigated revealed that only about one in five
clauses had its full quota of inherent phrases. At the same time there were only
three or four cases in which a verb had been ellipsed; and in each of them, the
ellipsed verb belonged to the second clause of a 'correlative' construction the first
verb of which was lexically identical with it (see example (5-264) below).
On the other hand, in everyday conversation there is a greater tendency for
given verbal complexes to be ellipsed. (5-205) is a typical conversational
exchange.
(5-205) A: gardlooni
I: hit: him
B: ngoorndooga
by: someone
A: nganyingga
by:me
A: 1 hit him.'
B: Who did?' (B was rather deaf)
A: 1did.'
Gooniyandi texts are spoken as sequences of TONE UNITS, which carry
distinctive intonation contours. They are delimited in example sentences and the
texts by slashes. Tone units are typically bounded on each side by short pauses.","[343, 344, 345]"
"5.4.2 Minor clauses
A class of MINOR clauses may be identified, which have no independent
propositional content. Minor clauses cannot be used as assertions. As opposed
to major clauses (with the single exception of existential relational clauses),392THE CLAUSEminor clauses may be characterised as those without a nexus. Evidently for a
clause to have propositional content, and to be used as a vehicle for the
independent communication of information it must involve a nexus (of course
one of the elements of this nexus may be ellipsed).
Although minor clauses cannot be used in making assertions, they may be
used in proposals and exclamations. The prototypical minor clause consists of
an interjection. Some, like ba 'come on, let's go', nya 'here you are', and bay
'eh?' are used as proposals. (The last of these is used in the elicitation of a
linguistic response and so is a proposal.) Others, like ngay, yay 'hey!', warawoo
'youtch', etc. are used in exclamations only.
Words from all classes except for verbals may realise minor clauses of
these two types; nominals are quite frequently used in this function. In a minor
clause a nominal may be used as a vocative- e.g. yoowooloo! 'Man!'; and the
subsection terms are frequently used as vocatives, e.g. jawandi!, in calling to a
person of the jawandi subsection. Since their aim is to at least gain the
addressee's attention, vocatives could be considered to be proposals.
Less frequently, nominals are used in exclamations. For example, girlinggi
'penis' and nyaninyi 'vagina' are used at least these days as rough equivalents to
'prick' and 'cunt' respectively. Other than use in swearing, a nominal minor
clause may be used e.g. to draw attention to something, such as a snake, or
alcohol: barlanyi! 'snake!', gamba! 'water, grog'.
Another function that a minor clause may serve is to modify the
propositional content of a (usually) preceding clause. The interjections yoowayi,
yoowoo 'yes', and particles such as mar/ami 'nothing', mangaddi 'not, no', etc.
may realise such roles.
5.5 Non-finite clausesNon-finite clauses constitute a class of impoverished clauses which consist of an
obligatory non-finite verb, sometimes together with an NP, PP, or adverbial.
The non-finite verb (Vnr) distinguishes none of the person, number, tense, or
modal categories of the finite VP. It consists of a verbal root or stem, optionally
followed by an infinitive (see section 5.5.3), or by the progressive aspect
marker.
That there is no classifier means that there is less specificity in referring to the
Process. For example, the verbal root ngarag- can mean either 'work on', or
'make, complete', depending on the choice of classifier. This distinction cannot
be made in the non-fmite verb.","[375, 376]"
"482TOPICS IN SEMANTICSThis formula is a type of complement to formula (6-77) above which
describes the formal meaning of -moowa ON. It involves only the set-theoretic
relation, and not the scalar relation. For -moowa ON, the set relation is that A 2
is a proper subset of A 1; for -ngaddaya TOO, the relation is a strong negation of
this, A 2 is not contained in A 1 • Less formally, -moowa ON reduces from the
expected, while -ngaddaya TOO adds something new to what is expected.
Sense (i) 'any, some', as we have seen, occurs in two situations. The first
is where there is a presupposition that the situation does not obtain; that is, it is
expected that NO entity of the specified type is involved. What is asserted is that
at least one entity is actually involved. This asserted A 2 is clearly not contained
in the presupposed set. which is empty. The second is where there is an
expectation that a certain number, greater than zero, of items from the indefinite
set are, or may be, involved. The assertion is that more are actually involved;
here the asserted set CONTAINS but is not contained in, the presupposed set.
Sense (ii) 'too, also' occurs where there is a presupposition that a set of
entities exclusive of the one referred to by the constituent to which -ngaddaya
TOO is added, is the entire set involved in the situation. The asserted A2 is
clearly not contained in the presupposed A 1 ; in fact, the two sets are typically
disjoint.
6.3.6 -widdi UNKNThis morpheme is normally encliticised to indefinite NPs and PPs (i.e. ones
whose Entity nominal is an indefinite determiner), where it indicates specifically
that the identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. The indefinite
determiner itself (when not followed by -widdi UNKN) also suggests that the
identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker, but in addition it may have
the effect of requesting its identity from the hearer (see section 5.4.1). However,
with -widdi VNKN encliticised to it, the indefinite is never response-requesting.
That is, not only is the identity of the referent unknown to the speaker, but it is
immaterial:
