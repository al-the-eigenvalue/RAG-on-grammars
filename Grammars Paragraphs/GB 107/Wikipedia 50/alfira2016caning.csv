In the Caning language there are different types of words: nouns, verbs, prepositions,
pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and connectors. We will learn about these in this book. We will
also learn about how the words go together into groups of words called phrases, clauses, and
sentences. The words and how they go together are called grammar.
Learning about the words and groups of words in Caning can help you become a better reader
and writer. It is especially important for those writing books and translating Scripture to
understand the lessons of this book.
The lessons of the Caning Consonant & Vowel Book should be learned before learning from
this book. Most examples sentences in this book come from the stories at the end of this book.
Some words such as ‘consonant’ and ‘vowel’ are used in this book without being explained.
These words are explained in the Caning Consonant & Vowel Book. If you forget their
meaning, you can look them up in the glossary at the back of this book. There are many new
words in this book which are used to explain the grammar of Caning. Each new word is
underlined and explained when it is first used. If you later see the word and forget what it
means, you can also find it explained in the glossary at the back of this book.
This book can be taught to participants in a workshop. A person can also use this book to
teach himself/herself without a workshop or instructor. You should read each lesson and then
immediately do the exercise following the lesson. The exercise will help you test your
understanding of the lesson. The answers to the exercises are in the back of the book. After
completing an exercise, immediately check your answers to see how well you have understood.
For each of your incorrect answers, try to understand the correct answer. Ask other Caning if
you need help.","[3, 4]"

"In the lesson Locating near suffixes, we learn locating near suffixes can be used as an equal
sign to compare one noun with another, to identify a nearby or recently mentioned noun, or to
show the end of a relative clause. Locating near suffixes can also be on verbs to show the
action is near the speaker.
In (A&N 80), the locating near suffix –nang shows the verb kawunonang ‘come here’ happens
near the speaker.

"Identifying and locating near suffixes on verbs
In the lesson Identifying suffixes, we learned that identifying suffixes can be an equal sign in a
sentence without a verb, they can show the end of an identifying relative clause, and they can
show a clause depends on another clause to make a complete sentence. Identifying suffixes can
be attached to any kind of word. In this lesson we learn how they are attached to verbs.
In (AKT 16) the identifying suffix –ang on the verb kawungang ‘came’ shows the clause Ka
nox Tumos kawungang ‘if you see elephant come’ depends on the following words to make a
complete sentence. These words cannot be a sentence by themselves.
(AKT 16) (Dependent clause)
Ka nox Tumos kawungang,
If you see Elephant come,
sogawa ka käsängga nde axony gi. pretend to sleep and I will save you.
In (Nyax 34), the identifying suffix –ang shows the end of the identifying relative clause
nyäpaye nyängadetang ‘I like’. This clause shows which ꞌdogi ‘thing’ we are talking about. It is
the word mentioned in the line before that Lion wanted to tell the animals.
(O&A 2) (End of identifying relative clause)
Na oxayda kawuno tä dänggäAnd the animals came to listen to

In this lesson we learn about the identifying suffixes. We learn about other complement
suffixes in following lessons.
Identifying suffixes4 can be an equal sign in a sentence without a verb. In this way they help
identify or tell information about certain nouns. They can show the end of an identifying
relative clause (a group of words with a verb that tells which noun we are talking about). They
can also show a clause depends on another clause to make a complete sentence. They can also
show the end of a phrase (group of words without a verb) that is in focus, the most important
words of the sentence.
In (N&A 1), the identifying suffix –g on aminug ‘are friends’ is like an equal sign that shows
Nyaxolow na Apoco ‘Hyena and Hare’ are the same as aminu ‘friends’. It identifies or tells
more information about these particular nouns.
(N&A 1) (Equal sign)

"Elephant says (T&A 11) in response to Fox when he meets Elephant and his family on a
journey in the bush and asked who they are. Elephant ignores the question of Fox, and the
locating near suffix puts emphasis on was ‘we’ and what they going to do.
In (Nyax 71), the suffix –kanang shows the words nyämändäs nganag ‘he asked elder sisters’
tell which mäned ‘asking’ we are talking about. This locating near suffix comes at the end of
this identifying relative clause.
(Nyax 71) (End of identifying relative clause)
Na sawuno tä colonggo, na nyamän,
kala mäneki nyämändäs nganakanang.",[91]
"- 84 -We learn more about this use of the identifying suffix in the lesson Identifying relative clauses
and Identifying suffixes on verbs.
In (A&A 12), the identity suffix –kang on asug ‘market’ shows the words käꞌdoccig tä wang
asukang ‘we go to market’ depend on the following words to make a complete sentence. These
words cannot be a finished sentence by themselves.
(A&A 12) (Dependent clause)
Gom käꞌdoccig tä wang asukang. Later, when we go to the market,
ndä aꞌdakasa gi noy.
I will untie you and you can escape.
In (O&A 52), the suffix –ang shows the group of words ꞌdärägsä ze tängang ‘brain of head’ are
the most important in the sentence. It is what the question asks about.

"Pointing far suffixes
Pointing far suffixes point to a noun away from the speaker or near the hearer. When telling
stories, it shows the noun was previously mentioned.
In (Pedi 39), the pointing far suffix –i ‘that’ on ꞌdog ‘thing’ shows it is away from the speaker.
(Pedi 39) (Away from speaker, near hearer)
Ndä camän päxä atänace ka,
Then she asked her grandchild,
“ꞌDogi kawung tiyati?”
“Did that thing come up?”
The grandmother is asking her grandchild about the sorghum stock that she threw into the
water and is now away from her.
In (Nyax 89-90), the pointing far suffix –zi on Nyaxolow ‘Hyena’ shows the Hyena has already
been mentioned in the story.
(Nyax 89-90) (Previously mentioned)
Na Nyaxolow käxsä na cabag päxäsa, And Hyena died and she took child,
na nya päxä Nyaxolowzi.
and it is child of that Hyena.
Before this we heard about how Hyena died from oil. The pointing far suffix shows the Hyena
that is the father of the child is the same hyena that died.
A pointing far suffix on a noun can also be used to introduce an identifying relative clause (a
group of words with a verb that is used to show which noun we are talking about).
In (O&A 2), the pointing far suffix –i on ꞌdogi ‘thing that’ introduces the relative clause
nyäpaye nyängadetang ‘he wanted them to hear’.
(O&A 2) (Introduces an identifying relative clause)
Na oxayda kawuno tä dänggä
And the animals came to listen to
ꞌdogi nyäpaye nyängadetang.
the thing which he wanted them to hear.
The words nyäpaye nyängadetang help identify which ꞌdog is talked about. We learn more about
these relative clauses in the lesson Identifying relative clauses.",[60]
"Locating near suffixes
Locating near suffixes can be used as an equal sign to compare one noun with another. They
can also identify a nearby or recently mentioned noun that we are talking about (topic). They
often show which pronoun we are talking about (topic) and can give emphasis to it. They can
also show the end of an identifying relative clauses.
In (T&A 37), the locating near suffix –yang on buguning ‘king’ is like an equal sign that
compares the king with someone ngonde tagäng ‘bigger than me’.
(T&A 37) (Equal sign)
Buguningziyang ngonde tagäng.",[90]
"Identifying suffixes
In the table below, there are five ways of talking about the noun nyang, nyanginy ‘crocodile,
crocodiles’ with complement suffixes (enclitics). Each of the complement suffixes make a
comment about the noun. A complement suffix with the noun can be a sentence by itself, or
can be part of a sentence.

"It is most common for plural complement suffixes to begin with –a-. However, plural
complement suffixes can instead begin with –ta- when the final root letter is d, -ka- when the
final root letter is g, -wa- when the final root letter is u or o, and -ya- when the final root letter
is i or e. Plural complement suffixes can be without a beginning consonant and a when the final
3Boyeldieu, Pascal (2009) in Afrika und Übersee, 90:9-84 considers all these noun forms to be unmodified and
without suffixes. That is, the various copulas are all separate words. However, since speakers do not think of these
copulas as separate words, and because there is some morpholophonology to support them as being bound to nouns,
this book presents them as bound (probably they are enclitics similar to the enclitic copulas of Gaahmg, another
Eastern Sudanic language.).",[51]
"In prepositional phrases, ta or tä is separate before the noun. However, in adverbs, ta, tä is
connected to the noun (see spelling rule 8).
Adverbs can tell about the manner, place, or time of the action or give other meaning in the
sentence. Many can take the place of the underlined words in (1) or (2).
(1) Apang kawung tägaxse. (?) Man came inside.
(2) Kig kasog ꞌdog mänang. (?) Person made the thing like that.",[122]
"- 93 -Locating far suffixes
Locating far suffixes show we are talking about a noun away from the speaker. In stories,
locating far suffixes are almost always used in speeches. Sometimes they are used for the first
mention of a noun.
In (A&N 49), the locating far suffix –kani on ꞌdog ‘thing’ shows Hare is talking about
something away from him. It is far enough away that someone will have to go get it and bring
it back. (A&N 49) is the first mention of this thing like fire.
(A&N 49)
Ama buguning, ꞌdokani kaꞌdas mas.","[94, 95]"
"Verbal nouns
Verbal nouns are verbs that are used as nouns. They can be introduced by prepositions,
possessed, the object of a verb, or used in other ways as nouns. Most verbal nouns only have a
plural form which takes plural suffixes, but a few have both a singular and plural form. Many
verbal nouns have the suffixes –ad, ed, -id or -d, but some verbal nouns are without any suffix,
and are the same as the verb root.
In (T&A 6-7), the verb wuxi ‘drinks’ has the suffix –id. It is used as the noun wuxid ‘drinking’
- 171 -being introduced by the preposition tä ‘for’.
(T&A 6-7) (Introduced by preposition)
Na säwedeccä na penggänya nyäꞌdingidi
ewetäng siye i säwedetäse tä luku tä wuxid.","[172, 173]"
"Main Clauses and Dependent Clauses
A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. An identity suffix –ang often
attaches to the end of the last word of a dependent clause.
In the following sentences, the identity suffix –ang attaches the last word of clauses to show
they depend on the following words to be a complete sentence.
(A&A 12)
Gom käꞌdoccig tä wang asukang.
ndä aꞌdakasa gi noy.
(A&A 29)
Abad, kasog gi mänang songang,
asiye wekägi song.

"Modifier connector suffixes (Adjectival)
A connector suffix shows a noun is grouped together with the following word or group of
words. It is identified, described or possessed by these words. There are three different
connector suffixes: one for an identifying relative clause that identifies which particular noun it
is, one for an adjective or relative clause that describes the noun, and one for a possessor of the
noun.

identifying relative clause. In this way it is used as a connector suffix. We learn more about
this use of the pointing far suffix in the lesson Identifying relative clauses. In this lesson, we
learn how the modifier connector suffix introduces words that describe the noun. In the next
lesson, we learn how the possessor connector suffix introduces a noun that owns the noun.
- 66 -Modifier connector suffixes show a noun is described by the following word or clause (a group
of words with a verb). The following word(s) can be an adjective, a quantity, or a descriptive
relative clause (a clause describing the previous noun). All these words describe or give more
information about the noun.
In (T&A 1), the suffix –za on buguningza ‘king that’ shows the following adjective ngonde
‘important’ gives more information about buguning. Ngonde tells us what kind of buguning we
are talking about.
(T&A 1) (Connects an adjective)
Mägacäng wane, ka Tumos nyänäs
buguningza ngonde tä kaxsed.","[67, 68]"
"Passive
In Caning, the prefix sa- ‘they’ on transitive verbs with an object before the verb can have a
general meaning of ‘some people’. When this subject prefix has this meaning, it is as if the
verb is done by an unmentioned subject, which is like a passive verb in other languages.
In (Pedi 7-8), the subject prefix sa- ‘they’ on sadogäng ‘they give’ are unmentioned people.
This action is done to the object abisoloni ‘sorghum’ which comes before the verb sadogäng.
(Pedi 7-8)
Nya abisoloni nuxung sadogäng täging, If only sweet sorghum was given to you, you would
ziye ndä pelewa song na mayanäs.
eat and not be able to finish and be satisfied.",[177]
"In (A&N 22-23), the suffix –a on ꞌdoga ‘thing that’ shows the relative clause nyäsog nde nyäbag
ya wadäkänya ‘he could do inorder to take meat for himself’ tells specific new information
about the ꞌdog ‘thing’.
(A&N 22-23) (Connects a descriptive relative clause; noun is object in relative clause)
Nyägäꞌdoc tä kärekä ngakä ꞌdoga nyäsogo nde He went to think about thing that he could do
nyäbag ya wadäkänya.
inorder to take meat for himself.
The information of the relative clause is new. The listeners have not been told before this point
in the story that Hare wants to take the meat. The noun ꞌdog ‘thing’ is the object (receives the
action) of the verb nyäsogo ‘he does ’ in the relative clause.
In (T&A 25), the suffix –na on diniyena ‘storm that’ shows the relative clause wede ‘is coming’
tells new information about the ꞌdog ‘thing’.
(T&A 25) (Connects a descriptive relative clause; noun is subject in relative clause)
Yex diniyena wede?
Do you know the storm that is coming?
The noun diniye ‘storm’ is the subject (does the action) of the verb wede ‘is coming’ in the
relative clause.
Descriptive relative clauses do not have identifying or location near suffixes unless these
suffixes are used for a larger part of the sentence than just the descriptive relative clause. In
(Pedi 9-10), the suffix –za on ceza ‘she that’ shows the relative clause cadogäng taging ‘she
- 119 -gives to you’ tells new information about the ce ‘she (grandmother)’.

A relative clause is a group of words with a verb that tells about a previous noun. An
identifying relative clause is introduced by the pointing far suffix –i on a noun and shows
which particular noun we are talking about. A descriptive relative clause is introduced by a
modifier connector suffix –a on a noun and gives new information about that noun.
Identifying ꞌDogi kagoyingang nyang kadelengang. (?) The thing that I brought fell.
Descriptive Agäre ngakä ꞌdoga asogo. (?)
I think about the thing that I will do.
In this lesson, we learn about identifying relative clauses. In the next lesson we learn about
descriptive relative clauses. The noun identified by a relative clause can take the place of the
object or subject in the identifying relative clause. The noun can also be the subject or
- 116 -complement in an identifying relative clause without a verb. An identifying suffix –ng or
locating near suffix –nang attaches to the verb or other words of an identifying relative clause.
In the lesson Pointing far suffixes, we learned that pointing far suffixes point to a noun away
from the speaker, or show a noun was previously mentioned. In (Nyax 90), the pointing far
suffix –zi on Nyaxolowzi ‘the Hyena’ shows Hyena has been mentioned before. It is the same
Nyaxolow that dies in the first line of (Nyax 89).
(Nyax 89-90) (Pointing far suffix)

Pointing near suffixes (Proximal demonstratives)

one for a noun that is known by the hearers.

Pointing near suffixes point to a noun near the speaker. In stories, the pointing near suffix is
nearly always used in speeches.
In (Nyax 81-84) the pointing near suffix –ong ‘this’ is on the noun läg ‘smoke’ to show it is
near the one speaking.
(Nyax 81-84)
Ndä kala läge lägo ndä sängeccä.

"In the following lessons, we will learn about each of these verb forms, one at a time.
Two types of verbs
There are two types of verbs that differ in prefixes and the changes of the first root consonant.
- 127 -Each can also have vowel changes in the suffixes.
Different prefixes
Nearly all verbs have subject prefixes that change with the subject pronoun before the verb.
The subject prefixes on incomplete verbs are different than on complete verbs.

theyAll verbs have the same subject prefixes in incomplete forms, but not all verbs have the same
subject prefixes in complete forms. There are two sets (groups) of subject prefixes in complete
forms of verbs. Some verbs (type 1) have complete form subject prefixes like mele ‘give back’
above. These include mägä-, cägä-, nyägä-, wagä-, sägä-. Other verbs (type 2) have complete
form subject prefixes like mene ‘take’ below. These include ma-, ca-, nya-, ka-, sa-.

form. In the dictionary, complete forms are listed after the meaning in English and after the
command form.
mele1 v.tr give back mele, kämeley
mene1 v.tr 1) take, catch, hold, trap 2) care for mene/nang, kamen- 128 -The complete forms in the dictionary can be in the sentece Kig ____ (ꞌdog). ‘The person ____
(thing)’. Type 1 complete verbs in this sentence have the prefix kä- such as in kämeley ‘gave
back’. Type 2 complete verbs in this sentence have the prefix ka- such as in kamen ‘took’.
Consonant changes
In some type 1 verbs, there are changes in the first consonant of the root. In the type 1 verb
poko ‘carry’, the first consonant p changes to mp for the subject pronouns agä ‘I’, gi ‘you(sg)’
and angga‘you(pl)’ in both incomplete and complete forms, and for was ‘we (not you)’ in the
incomplete form.

"Compound phrases
A compound phrase is more than one word used together to make a new meaning. There are
compound phrase nouns, compound phrase adjectives and compound phrase adverbs.
Compound phrase nouns are most often made from a noun possessing another noun, but can
also be a noun followed by an adjective or adverb. The possessed noun has the possessor
connector suffix –ä. Plural compound phrase nouns are most often made with the plural of both
nouns.

talked about. It is a singular noun that is near the speaker. Maybe the speaker is even pointing
at op while talking.
Singular (1) Opong kadeläng.
This young man fell.
Plural
(2) Opinygong kadelesäng. These young men fell.
In (2), the suffix –gong shows opiny ‘young men’ is a plural noun near the speaker.
The suffix –ong with beginning vowel is the most common pointing near suffix on singular
nouns. However, other singular nouns have pointing near suffixes with a beginning consonant,
such as –t-, -d-, -s-, -c-, -z-, -n-. Nouns with the same final letter in the root (such as d)
sometimes attach suffixes with different beginning consonant (such as Ø, -t-, -s-, where Ø
means without a beginning consonant).

And then she told her elder sister,
“Do you still (see) our person?
Didn‘t this guy eat all our elder sisters?”
And tears from their eyes came pouring out.
Bend over with your head and we will pour oil
into your anus so that you will be fat.
And the child of the Hyena responded saying,
“My mother killed my father.”
You cut out the liver for his hand.
You are saying there is a problem in his anus?

2Boyeldieu, Pascal (2009) in Afrika und Übersee, 90:9-84 speaks of the noun unmodified form such as nyang
‘crocodile’ and the noun modified form such as nyangz- which includes the consonant z in this noun, but would
include other consonants for other nouns. In this way, the morphology is simplified a great deal. However, it
remains to be seen if Caning speakers think of the noun in this way since the ‘modified form’ of the noun is never
without a suffix. That is, it is not possible to say nyangz without adding additional segments. Thus, this book does
not compare modified with unmodified forms of nouns, and instead presents the morphology in a way that is
perhaps closer to the mind of the speaker.","[48, 49]"

Possessor pronouns of verbal nouns can be used as object pronouns. In (Nyax 47), the verbal
noun bäng ‘calling’ has the possessor pronoun äce ‘her’. The possessed verbal noun bangäce
‘her calling’ has the meaning ‘called her’.
(Nyax 47) (Possessor of verb noun used as object pronoun)
Na kala nyägäpätäng
And then he waited and
nyäwede tä bängäce.
continued for calling of her.
Possessor pronouns are attached to nouns, but object pronouns are separate from verbs (see
spelling rule 9).
All possible object and subject pronouns are listed below on the incomplete and complete verb
‘refuse’. Object pronouns are separate from verbs ending either in a vowel or consonant.",[159]

A cardinal number tells the exact amount of a noun. An ordinal number tells the order a noun
comes in a list of nouns. Most numbers follow a noun with a modifier suffix. However, the
number nuxu ‘one’ can come before a noun when it is used as an adverb to mean ‘only’. And
the number nuxu can be used as an indefinite to show which particular noun is not known.
Numbers can also be used alone without a noun, if the noun is known from previous sentences.
In (A&A 2), the number nuxu ‘one’ shows the exact number of houses the animals lived in.
The noun pana ‘house that’ has the modifier suffix –na ‘that’.
(A&A 2) (After noun)

"Adjectives
Adjectives describe (tell about) a noun. Adjectives have singular and plural forms. Singular
adjectives follow singular nouns and plural adjectives follow plural nouns. The nouns they
follow often have a modifier connector suffix or a location near suffix. Adjectives can occur
without a noun if the noun is known from the previous sentences.
In (T&A 34), the adjective ngonde ‘big’ follows the noun buguningza ‘king that’ with the
modifier suffix –za ‘that’.
(T&A 34) (Following noun with modifier connector suffix)
I buguningza ngonde wundung?
But is the big king absent?
In (T&A 37), the adjective ngonde ‘big’ follows the noun buguningziyang ‘The king here is’
- 110 -with the location near suffix –ziyang ‘here is’.
(T&A 37) (Following noun with complement suffix)
Buguningziyang ngonde tagäng?

In (T&A 49), the adjective ngonde ‘big’ describes the noun buguning ‘king’ which is not
mentioned in this sentence, but known from the previous sentences of the story.

"In stories, object nouns and pronouns are used to show clear meaning of who is receiving the
action. If the meaning is clear without mentioning the object, a verb without either noun or
pronoun object can be used.
In (T&A 21), the object pronoun anggo ‘you (pl)’ is the family of elephants that Fox is talking
with. This pronoun makes it clear this family receives the action of the verb kanox ‘saw’.
(T&A 14-15) (Pronoun object)
E nga mo kalaygädä kax
kanox anggo song.",[158]
"Towards suffixes (Ventive)
Towards suffixes show the action happens towards the speaker or towards the previous location
talked about in the story [check this]. The towards suffix –äng is similar to the identifying
suffix –(a)ng. But whereas the towards suffix is only on verbs, the identifying suffix can be on
any kind of word. And whereas the towards suffix always has the vowel ä, the identifying
suffix can only have the vowel a.",[186]
"Pointing far suffixes are also used to introduce identifying relative clauses. In (A&N 49-50),
the suffix –i on masi ‘fire that’ introduces the clause kabotosang ndä awungang nang ‘I brought
and came with it’.
(A&N 49-50) (Identifying relative clause; noun is object in relative clause)
“Ama buguning, ꞌdokani kaꞌdas mas.”
“You oh king, there is a thing like fire.”
Na Apoco ngade ka,
And the Hare said,
“Nya masi kabotosang ndä awungang nang.”
It is fire that I brought and came with it.”
This identifying relative clause tells that the noun mas ‘fire’ is not just any mas, but the
particular mas Hare brought that morning for Nyaxolow to use for cooking meat. The
identifying suffix –ang attaches to the verbs kabotosang ‘I brought’ and awungang ‘I came’.
The noun mas ‘fire’ is the object (receives the action) of the verb kabotosang ‘I brought’ in the
relative clause.
In (T&A 59), the suffix –ni on käxägini ‘your person that’ introduces the clause kawungang ‘he
came’.
(T&A 59) (Identifying relative clause; noun is subject in relative clause)
I käxägini kawungang, läpi ka
But your person that comes,
mänang mäs käxa ngondeyang, . . .
say to that big person, . . .
The identifying suffix –ang attaches to the verb kawungang ‘he came’. The noun käxägi ‘your
person’ is the subject (does the action) of the verb kawungang ‘He came’ in the relative clause.
In (O&A 16), the suffix –zi on buguningzi ‘king who’ introduces the clause ginang ‘here is
you’.
(O&A 16) (Identifying relative clause; noun is subject in relative clause)
Gi layis abad, ꞌdogä nycakä
You are stupid. Here is the throne
buguningzi ginang.
of the king who here is you.
The locating near suffix –nang attaches to the pronoun gi ‘you’. The noun buguning ‘king’ is- 117 -the subject of the relative clause ginang ‘is you’.
In (1), the suffix –i on the singular noun opi ‘young man which’ introduces the identifying
relative clause kagoyingang nyang ‘I brought it’.
Singular (1) Opi kagoyingang nyang kadelengang.
The young man which I brought fell.
Plural
(2) Opinygi kagoyingang sag kadelasängang. The young men which I brought fell.
In (2), the suffix –gi on the plural noun opinygi ‘young men’ introduces the identifying relative
clause kagoyingang sag ‘which I brought’.

storyUsually a noun has two forms. For example, op ‘young man’ is the singular form used for one
person, and opiny ‘young men’ is the plural form used for more than one person.
There are three ways that nouns have singular and plural forms. They can add suffixes (ending
letters of the word) to the singular form as in uxic ‘worm’. They can add suffixes to the plural
form as in axiny ‘hut’. They can also add suffixes in both singular and plural forms as in
winic, wininy ‘vulture, vultures’.

"Adverbs
An adverb describes (tells about) a verb. It often follows the verb but can also come before the
verb. Adverbs can tell about the manner, place, or time of the action, or give other meaning in
the sentence. Many adverbs that tell about a place are made of the preposition ta, tä ‘to, for, at’
connected to a noun.
In (AKT 17), the adverb loy ‘flat’ tells how Kamalä ‘Camel’ did the action kasängga ‘slept’,
and follows this verb.
(AKT 17) (Manner adverb following verb)
Na Tumos käleza na Kamalä
kasängga loy tä zäg.",[122]
"They came to the river, and he asked and began
to ask the elder sister.
You people, come because they are here.
And I was really thinking about you
here and do I know what to do (implied ꞌnoꞌ)?
Ok, I want you to tell me a deceitful way
to transfer the meat without eating it.
Hyena said to Hare,
“You are your body is good?” Hare said,
“Yes, I am my body is good.”
When you go hunting and kill a cow
and you have no fire, what do you do then,
or do you eat (the meat) raw?
It is you that walks for us because you are tall.
Meat of the mouth is for you, skin is for me,
Do not kill me,
for I am not the one that killed the cow.
“Mother of those people, are you fine?” And
the wife of the king said, “Yes, we are fine.”
And the king said, “I am the one,
my word remains the word of this wife,
not walking
am I supposed to close my eyes and go?
Like this, the wife will walk with
two legs and be kept safe.",[260]
"Incomplete verbs can be used for past, present or future actions that talk about the action as an
ongoing process. In (Nyax 15), the incomplete verbs anoc ‘I go’ and abagäs ‘I marry’ are future
actions that happen after the time when the hyena says this speech.
(Nyax 15) (Incomplete for future)
Anoc abagäs uxandäng tägog.",[138]
