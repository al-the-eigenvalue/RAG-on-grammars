"If we assume that the presence of functional projections in a clause is indicatedby the presence of affixes on the verbs that correspond to the heads of these projections,
we can note that the Zuni verb contains only the stem plus the infinitival suffix -nakya
(27a), and cannot appear with plural subject agreement (27b), tense inflection (27c), or
even a negation suffix (28a-b).39
39 The impossibility of negation with the infinitive is illustrated with both the non-stative and the stativeform of the negative suffix in (28a-b). The parenthesized example in (27c) and the parenthesis (28c) refer
to the possibility that the -na part of the infinitive suffix may be related to the stative morpheme -na (whichwould precede any inflection).",[64]

"Thereader should note, however, that this sketch is not intended to provide a complete
grammatical description of Zuni but merely intended as an introduction to basic structural
features of the language, particularly elements that will appear in examples throughout
the dissertationas well structural properties that will be relevant to the theoreticaldiscussion in Chapters 2-4.41.3.1 Basics of Morphology and Syntax
1.3.1.1Word Order
In Zuni the verb occurs finally and strictly so; only an adverbial particle used toconvey perfect aspect (see example (40a) below) and parenthetical type adjuncts appear
to be able to follow the verb.",[20]
"I further assume that ho’does not originate VP externally but rather moves to this position from inside the VP
based on arguments for the origin of subject arguments inside the VP (cf. Sportiche 1988,Fukui 1986).
The position of the negation particle in example (10) illustrates that in contrast,
lexical NP arguments do not undergo movement out of VP.",[54]
"Negation in Zuni involves the30 Zuni word order (see Chapter I Section 1.3.1) is strict SOV in the sense that the verb must appear
finally

they doundergo focus movement, to be described below).",[52]

question words, see Chapter 2 Section 2.5).","[41, 42]"
"This particle can occur inone of two positions, either close to the verb stem as in (8a) or farther to the left as in (8b)in a position where a number of other particles (evidential and adverbial) also occur (see
Section 1.3.4.2).",[53]
"Theseparticles are morphologically invariant (and therefore are different from verb forms) and
usually occur at or near the beginning of the clause (i.e. preceding any arguments).(46)a.‘imat_ho'‘ok'e-kkyaseemsIsg.nom.win-past‘It seems I won.’23 This last verb is discussed in Chapter 4.",[43]
"Examples (18a-c) below illustrate the use of Zuni strong subject, object, and
possessive pronouns as single word (bare) responses to questions.",[58]
"For this reasonwe find inflectional58 Everett (1996) proposes a somewhat similar conception of the nature of inflectional features (his
proposal for the origin of the configurations that these features occur in differs from the proposal here that
licensing requirements constrain these configurations). For him, inflectional categories, or inherent
features, are stored separately in the lexicon and inserted into functional heads (Agr’ and D’), so that
inflectional features are associated with spell-out rules rather than taking the form of traditional morphemesstored in the lexicon. These features are inserted into heads in the configurations shown in (i); for Everett
the distribution of the heads containing these features is determined by differences in the category of thehead inserted into (D° vs. Agr*) and by properties of the selecting head (basically + subcategorizing).(i)Pronouns:(D™[D* phi-features]}Clitics:[x""™"" [AGR’ phi-features]Affixes:[X°[AGR* phi-features]]72[X""™* _.. ]]features - and here I mean specifically person, number, and gender features, since tense is

Dutch (and scrambling in V-final languages like Hindi (Mahajan 1990), Korean and Japanese) is the same
