"7.3.1. Negative Clitics
There exist two negative clitics: /=ŋgó/, which is used in both NoG and SoG and
/=cê/, which is used by Gumuz speakers living in and around Sirba Abay wereda
(county) as well as parts of Wenbera and Agelo Met’i weredas. These clitics are
restricted to attaching to main clause verbs (7.185-7.187); when negating a subordinate
clause, one must use (with some exceptions) a negative auxiliary (see Chapter XI,241examples 11.64, 11.65). Also, as stated previously in section 7.2.1.2, the negative clitic
does not normally co-occur with the affirmative prefix.","[270, 271]"
"206Other morphemes can occupy the first position on the verb; all but one (the
jussive) of these others introduce subordinate clauses: /nágó-/ ‘when, because’, /ká-/ ‘if’
(conditional), the relativizers /l-/ and /et-/, and the jussive /n-/. In this grammar, I refer to
all these first-position prefixes as markers of “mood”. Example (7.65) illustrates the
affirmative in a simple affirmative clause.
NoG
(7.65) d-á-gáχ
AFF-3SG.INTR-be.good‘It was good.’7.2.1.1 The Affirmative Marker and Question Constructions
Lack of the affirmative morpheme with a final rise in intonation generally
indicates a Yes/No question (7.66). In SoG, one must also add the Yes/No question
marker /=ác/ or /=áj/ to the end of the clause (7.67) (see also section 7.3.2).
NoG

3SG.INTR-be.good‘Was it good?’
SoG
(7.67) a-tʃʼá-gá
dagoná=ác
3SG.TR-have-NFUT young.woman =YNQ
‘Do you have a young woman (to exchange in marriage)?’
However, it is not always obligatory to omit the ‘affirmative’ marker for a
question. In example (7.68), the same speaker found the verb with or without the
affirmative marker acceptable as a Yes/No question.

‘Did you go?’
For content questions, a question morpheme often takes the place of the
affirmative on the conjugated verb (7.69, 7.70). In SoG, the question words are not
bound and the affirmative marker can remain on the verb with all arguments that are
questioned. Some examples are given in (7.71) through (7.73). When either the S or O
arguments are questioned in SoG, the affirmative marker does not need to occur (7.74,
7.75).

NoG and SoG verbs lack the affirmative marker when the verb is negated. In
both NoG and parts of SoG (Kamashi) the negative clitic /=(a)ŋg̩ ó/ attaches to the end of
the conjugated verb. In (7.76) affirmative and negative forms of the same verb are used.

Certain subordinators in Gumuz occupy the same position on the nonfuture verb
as the ‘affirmative’ prefix. The subordinator ‘when, because’ / nágó-/ (NoG) is mutually
exclusive with the affirmative prefix (7.77).

(7.79) and /et(s)-/ (SoG) (7.80) occupy the first position of the verb and cannot co-occur
with the affirmative prefix.

9The non-initial or dependent (DEP) verbs of clause chains in SoG are marked with /-(á)ná/ in addition to
their lack of the affirmative prefix. If the affirmative is added to a non-initial (dependent, non-main) verb,
the resulting interpretation is that there is a lag in time between events.","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239]"

followed by a bound subject pronominal and the ma- construction. If the consequent
clause is semantically negative, both the conditional clause and the consequent clause use
the verbal construction with /b-/ (13.17). If the consequent clause is semantically
positive, the conditional clause will be introduced with /éé-/ (13.13). However, as shown
in (13.16) a negative hypothetical event in which the verb of the conditional clause is
affirmative and the verb of the consequent clause is negative is also possible with the
hypothetical n- construction.","[466, 467]"

7.2. Non-stem Morphology of the Verb
7.2.1. Mood
The first morpheme position on the verb (only the nonfuture verb in SoG) is
occupied by the ‘affirmative’ morphemeː /d-/ (NoG) and /b-/ (SoG). 8 Uzar (1989: 383)
first labeled this ‘affirmative’ as it does not occur with interrogatives or negatives. I have
maintained this label but ‘affirmative’ does not fully account for all instances of when
this morpheme is used. Notably, most non-initial affirmative verbs in subordinate clauses
and clause chains lack the affirmative morpheme.
8Some speakers in the Mandura area (NoG) vary this morpheme between /b-/ and /d-/.","[234, 235]"

Below are the variations from one Kamashi speaker in polite versus impolite negative

counterparts are : tsá ‘goǃ’, sá ‘eatǃ’, and fá ‘drinkǃ’. 14
14One explanation for the variation in tone for the Strong vs. Polite conjugation of CV verb roots is that
these roots may be toneless with a H tone added in the 2SG imperative form. That is, the roots tsa ‘go’ and
sa ‘eat’ may not be assigned tone but H tone is added for the 2SG imperative form. It is also possible that383(11.83)STRONG

Complements of Negative AuxiliariesTo negate a subordinate clause verb in Gumuz (save a few exceptions), one must
use a negative auxiliary in place of the negative enclitics =ŋgó (NoG, SoG-Kamashi) or
=cê (SoG-Sirba Abay) that are used for main clause verbs (see Chapter VII for further
discussion of negative enclitics). There exist two negative auxiliaries ko and batsʼ(-áʃ),
both of which are used in SoG (11.49, 11.60, 11.61), while only batsʼ is used in NoG
(11.43, 11.59). For most subordinate clauses, the complement of these negative
auxiliaries is a non-finite form of the ma- construction. 11(11.59)NoG

INTRODUCTIONGumuz is a Nilo-Saharan language/dialect cluster spoken in Western Ethiopia and
across the border in southeastern Sudan. This study compares the phonology and
selected aspects of the grammar of two major dialects within the Gumuz cluster:
Northern Gumuz (NoG) and Southern Gumuz (SoG), both of which are spoken in the
Benishangul-Gumuz Region of western Ethiopia. Analysis is based on twenty months of
fieldwork in Ethiopia conducted from September of 2007 through April of 2009.
Language data was gathered from thirty-three native speakers of Gumuz: fourteen from
NoG and nineteen from SoG. The Gumuz language consultants provided a total of sixtyeight texts of varying lengths and multiple genres, thirty-four texts from NoG and thirtyfour texts from SoG. In addition, a list of approximately two thousand words was
collected from each dialect as well as countless hours of elicited language data. To aid in
further comparison, I worked with two additional Gumuz language consultants from
Yaso wereda 1 eliciting several hours of language data and one text. To date, this is the
first description of Gumuz which analyzes and compares the grammar and phonology of
the two main dialects - that of the north and that of the south. In addition, this description
includes the first tonal analysis of any Gumuz dialect.
This first chapter gives an overview of the Gumuz language, where it is spoken, a
description of the dialect cluster, Gumuz culture, history, and migrations. It also includes
a review of previous descriptions of the Gumuz language and the various attempts to
classify it. Chapter II provides a description of the phonological inventories of NoG and
SoG, phonological rules, and a discussion of tonal contrasts as well as tonal downstep
and related rules. Chapter III covers the basic shape and phonology of simple noun words1A wereda is a political division roughly equivalent to a county in the United States. Ethiopian regions are
divided into zones, which are further divided into weredas. A wereda, in turn, is divided into smaller units
called k’ebeles.","[28, 29, 30]"
"Clitics
There are at least four enclitics found on fully inflected verb forms in Gumuz, twoof which are only found in SoG: the Yes/No question clitic and the clitic indicating
perfect aspect. Both dialects have the negative clitic /=ŋgó/ but the Sirba Abay
subdialect (SoG) has a distinct form /=cê/. A hearsay clitic is present in both dialects as
well. Clitics in Gumuz are phonologically bound in that tonal downstep of H tones does
not occur between the verb (or noun) and the enclitic, and there exists no phonological
pause between morphemes. However, the final /a/ on the word to which it attaches is
pronounced [a] instead of [ə] as though the vowel were in word-final position (see
Chapter II). All known clitics, with the exception of the aspectual clitic in SoG, occur on
nouns as well as verbs in Gumuz. The Yes/No question particle is a clause final clitic
while the remaining enclitics are word-final.",[270]

complement are expressed with the ma- construction (although the ma- on the negative
auxiliary forms part of the purposive prefix; see Chapter XIII). Unlike other negative
subordinate clauses, the negative auxiliary of the purpose clause remains uninflected for
person and number and its complement carries all inflection (11.62). The form of the
negative auxiliary in this construction, similar to the ‘go’ auxiliary in section 11.2.1.2,
appears to be a frozen 3SG form of the verb in the ma- construction: m-batsʼ-á (NMLZNEG.AUX-3SG.INTR).","[404, 405]"

A negative circumstantial adverbial clause is a dependent clause expressing an
event that did not or will not happen before the event of the matrix clause. These are
often translated into English as ‘without X-ing, ...’ In NoG, the construction for negative
adverbials is as follows: /kaʒiigá=/ + /mâ-/ (an abbreviated form of the purpose prefix) +
the verb root + any applicable morphemes ordered according to the future tense (13.24).
The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic appears to be comprised of the instrumental preposition /ka=/
followed by the verb root ʒiig ‘be poor, be without’. The final /á/ in this clitic complex is
440likely a remnant from the dative proclitic /ká=/ which forms the purposive prefix /káma-/
or /kám -/̀ (see Chapter 11). The /kaʒiigá=/ clitic is also found with NPs meaning
‘without’ or ‘except’ (13.25).","[469, 470]"

"To express that someone or something is the cause in NoG, one can use either tʃagwa ‘foot’ or maanɟa
‘fire’ as the first noun in the Associative Construction (Chapter VI) with the second noun functioning as the
cause. With tʃagwa, one must also use the locative preposition ná= and the cause is semantically neutral
(not negative). With maanɟa, the dative preposition ká= is used and the cause is negative (see also
example 13.28 for the metaphor ‘fire’ being used to indicate a ‘problem’). Both of these constructions
roughly translate as ‘because of X’.",[471]

However, it could be the case that ‘belly’ and ‘house’ form a nominal compound which
functions as the O argument and that ‘belly’ is not incorporated into the verb. Indeed
there exists a nominal compound: líí-mátsʼá (belly-house) ‘floor’. However, one can see
that ‘belly’ forms a phonological unit with ‘house’ in this NN compound as the vowel
and the consonant metathesize. In contrast, when forming a phonological unit with the
verb, ‘belly’ maintains its vowel-consonant structure: -ííl.13 In Southern Gumuz, however,
such a metathesis does not occur as the initial vowel-consonant structure is often found in
the noun stem as well as in the IN. Thus, other (syntactic) evidence would be necessary
for this dialect to demonstrate that the noun root contiguous with the verb root and the
following O argument do not actually form a NN compound. Indeed, both incorporation
and compounding are possible in Gumuz for clauses with (nearly) identical translations.
But there are clear differences between the structures as shown both by phonology and
negative placement. In (8.29a), the noun ílúkʼwá ‘head’ is incorporated into the verb stem.
However, in (8.29b) ílúkʼwá ‘head’ forms a compound with hosa ‘cow’14 and this
compound functions as the O argument. Both clauses can propositionally mean ‘Skin the
cow’s head’. In Gumuz, the negative =ŋg̩ ó is an enclitic that attaches to both nouns and
verbs. Examples (8.30 a-b) provide the negative forms of the commands in (8.29 a-b),
demonstrating that there is a word boundary between ‘head’ and ‘cow’ in example
(8.29a). On the other hand, the word boundary in (8.29b) is after the verb root kóɗ ‘skin’
as demonstrated with its negative form in (8.30b). Thus, (8.29a) and (8.30a) must have
INs in the verb stem as the negative enclitic should not separate the two noun roots of a
NN compound.","[284, 285]"

What I label a ‘negative command’ in Gumuz includes both the negative of
imperative forms as well as the negative of jussive forms. Negative imperative and
jussive forms are structurally the same: /ka-/ INSTR + ma- construction + bound subject
pronominal + negative enclitic in NoG and ma- construction + bound subject pronominal
+ negative enclitic in SoG. The 2SG form is often unmarked in SoG (11.80). 13 I gloss the
resulting /kama-/ (NoG) and corresponding /ma-/ (SoG) prefixes as NEG.IMP (negative
imperative).

overt, whether as part of a predicate nominal, or frequently appearing before the RC
(12.104). The verb of the RC can be expressed with or without the affirmative prefix /b-/
in the nonfuture tense in which case the relative pronoun/relativizer /etá-/ is
phonologically reduced to /et-/ when the affirmative prefix is not expressed (12.105)
(similar to relativizing on A arguments). Also, clauses relativized on an O argument can
be part of the 3PL Impersonal Construction; all examples of such a type demonstrate an
intransitive tonal melody on the bound subject pronominal on the RC verb (12.105,
12.106).","[454, 455]"

In NoG, conditional clauses are introduced with the prefix /k-/ on the verb in
place of the affirmative /d-/ prefix, and they are always expressed in the nonfuture tense.
The conditional adverbial clause takes the same form regardless of whether the matrix
clause expresses a ‘possible’ event, a hypothetical event (13.9), and/or ‘counterfactual’
event (13.10, 13.11); all these semantic readings are possible whether the matrix verb is
expressed in the future (13.10) or nonfuture tenses (13.9).2 When the matrix verb is2If the S argument of an intransitive conditional clause precedes the verb or is not overt, an /-á/ suffix is
added to the verb. This is the same suffix that is added to the verb of the relative clause in NoG under the
same conditions (see section 12.2.1.2 of Chapter XII). This /-á/ suffix might also indicate that the subject of435counterfactual, a special verbal construction is used comprised of the past tense auxiliary
tisákʼwá following a ‘future tense’ form of the main verb (13.11, 13.12). If the matrix
clause is an affirmative counterfactual, the negative form of the ‘future tense’ verb is
used (13.12). If the matrix verb is introducing a counterfactual event, the hypothetical
prefix /dega-/ is used on the ‘future tense’ main verb (13.11). 3(13.9)(13.10)NoG (Gumuz saying)

"12.3.2.1Relativizing on A ArgumentsWhen relativizing on A arguments, one can use either the /etá-/ (/etsá-/ in
Kamashi wereda) PRO.SG or the /dá-/ PRO.PL relative pronouns. In general, one cannot
use the relative pronouns with the /b-/ affirmative prefix when relativizing on an A
argument but there exist a few exceptions (12.90, 12.91). Also, when using the plural
relative pronoun for relativizing on an A argument, the bound subject pronominal
remains 3SG in form even when the referent is 3PL (12.91, 12.93).

In the present corpus, these pronouns more frequently introduce a RC which lacks
the affirmative prefix when relativizing on the A argument. Without the affirmative
prefix, the PRO.SG relative pronoun also lacks the final /á/ which carries H tone: /et-/ (/ets422/ in Kamashi wereda) (12.92). The plural pronoun, on the other hand, retains the /á/ vowel
(12.93).","[451, 452]"

If the conditional clause is semantically negative in SoG, the verb of the
conditional clause exhibits the following structure: the /n-/ prefix + a bound subject
pronominal + /gá-/ + the ma- construction + the /-n/ locative suffix (13.18). This latter
construction is also used to express the notion ‘before/without X-ing’ (13.19) and is often
used with 3PL impersonal subject marking (Chapter VII). 44The /-n/ locative suffix appears to mark a subordinate adverbial clause in SoG. However, temporal and
many conditional clauses are not marked with this suffix. It appears to be related to the /-ná/ found on noninitial verbs of clause chains in SoG.",[467]
"365result, there exist two instances of ma- constructions in (11.31): the complement (‘to
finish it’) of the negative auxiliary ko and the (possessed) clausal complement of the verb
‘know’ (‘to not finish it’).","[394, 395]"
"12.3.2 SoG Relative Clauses
There are two main strategies for relativizing on core arguments in SoGː 1) the
relative pronoun strategy and 2) the relativizer strategy. In SoG there exist two relative
421pronouns used to relativize on core arguments of a finite RC (where NoG has just one of
these)ː /etá-/ PRO.SG and /dá-/ PRO.PL. The relative pronoun /etá-/ can be used to
relativize on non-core participants, namely objects of prepositions. Lastly, the relative
pronoun /gó-/ ‘where’ relativizes on locations. All relative pronouns can either occur
with the affirmative prefix /b-/ of nonfuture verbs or without the prefix. When /etá-/
PRO.SG introduces a clause which lacks the affirmative prefix, the pronoun isphonologically reduced in that the final /á/ is lost. Along with phonological reduction,
there is some degree of semantic bleaching in that the ‘relative pronoun’ no longer
(necessarily) refers to animate singular referents. Thus, /et-/ begins to resemble a
relativizer in such constructions.","[450, 451]"

"12.3.1.4Relativizing on A ArgumentsWith the bare relativizer strategy, one can relativize on an A argument by simply
substituting the affirmative main clause prefix /d-/ with the relativizer /l-/ and adding H
tone to the transitive tonal melody of the bound subject pronominal. The RC is assumed
to be internally headed (12.50 b), mirroring the more typical AVO word order of Gumuz
main clauses (12.50 a).",[438]

case the RC is postnominal (12.97, 12.98). However, prenominal RCs are also possible
(12.99) as well as headless RCs (12.100). The RC retains the /b-/ affirmative prefix and
the tonal pattern of the verb in the RC is identical to that of intransitive main clause verbs
(when expressed in Active Voice).","[452, 453]"

When the RC consists of an auxiliary plus its nominalized complement, a clear
resumptive pronoun strategy is employed for relativizing on an O argument. Such is true
for both relativization strategies. With the bare relativizer strategy, the RC is prenominal
and the tonal pattern on the negative auxiliary is transitive. While the tonal pattern in
(12.77) suggests that it might be internally headed, the RC appears to have an external
head with a resumptive pronoun (RP) suffix (/-má/) on the nominalized verb of the RC
which is coreferential with the external head.","[445, 446]"

ADVERBIAL CLAUSESThis chapter describes various types of functional adverbial clauses found in
Gumuz. Some adverbial clauses utilize the ma- construction which was introduced in
Chapter XI, but others do not. Temporal and conditional (and some causal) adverbial
clauses are simply introduced with an erstwhile preposition followed by a finite verbal
form. Some temporal and conditional clauses involve the morpheme /gó-/ found in
relator noun constructions (Chapter III) as well as ‘where’/‘place’ relative clauses
(Chapter XII). Adverbial clauses involving hypothetical and/or counterfactual events are
formed with a finite form of the ma- construction combined with the affirmative prefix
and other possible erstwhile prepositions. Yet other adverbial clauses can be introduced
with a distinct phonological words/phrases (or clitics) meaning ‘at the time of’ and
‘because’, and ‘without’. Lastly, purpose adverbial clauses are introduced with the prefix
̀ whether nonfinite or finite. This last prefix is a combination of the
/kám -/,
dative/benefactive /ká=/ preposition plus the ma- nominalizing prefix (of the maconstruction). Purposive clauses in NoG can also be formed with the /ká=/ prefix
followed by /gó-/ plus the ma- construction.
The following sections are organized by function and not by structure. Section
13.1 describes temporal adverbial clauses, section 13.2 describes conditional adverbial
clauses, section 13.3 describes concessive adverbial clauses, section 13.4 describes
negative circumstantial adverbial clauses, section 13.5 covers causal adverbial clauses,
and section 13.6 describes purpose clauses.","[459, 460, 461]"

form to the participant nominalizations referring to animate plural A/S arguments. A
participant nominalization similar to (12.10) exists in NoG as well (12.13a). The main

erstwhile O argument and dá is repeated as the predicate nominal. When negated with

derivational morphology on nouns. Chapter IV describes both bound and free
pronominals. These include personal pronouns, subject and object pronominals on the
verb, possessive suffixes on nouns, as well as interrogative and relative pronouns.
Chapter V discusses the possible constituents of both noun phrases and prepositional
phrases, the latter of which demonstrates some syntactic properties of a noun phrase.
Chapter VI describes nonfinite nominal modification constructions, which demonstrate
properties of both compounds and phrases. Chapter VII covers the structure of the verb
word, discussing verbal morphology and the relative positions of morphemes on the verb.
The grammars of the two Gumuz dialects , NoG and SoG, are most divergent with regard
to verbal morphology. Thus, the similarities and differences between the two are
discussed in great detail in Chapter VII. Chapter VIII introduces the synchronic process
of noun incorporation in Gumuz, as a prelude to the more grammaticalized (and
lexicalized) historically incorporated nouns/class morphemes to be discussed later in
Chapter IX. Chapter IX describes both the verbal classifiers and class morphemes which
historically arose from body part terms in Gumuz. The resultant noun categorizations
that arose from these grammaticalized body part terms (some of which are verbally
incorporated and others of which form part of NN compounds) are described in detail.
Chapter X describes simple clauses found in Gumuz, including copular clauses,
expressions of possession, comparative and superlative constructions, intransitive and
transitive clauses, and possible ditransitives. Case marking alignment is also briefly
discussed. Chapter XI describes the various constructions in Gumuz in which verbs
nominalized with /ma-/ are utilized. These constructions include complements,
subordinate clauses, progressive aspect, and the negative jussive/imperative forms.
Chapter XII covers the various clausal constructions ranging from participant
nominalizations to fully finite relative clause constructions. Lastly, Chapter XIII
discusses various adverbial clauses including temporal, conditional, concessive,
hypothetical/counterfactual, causal, and purpose clause constructions.","[30, 31]"

"2107.2.1.4 Jussive
In Gumuz, the jussive mood relates to commands for third person subjects and is
marked by the prefix /n-/. This jussive prefix occupies the same position as the
‘affirmative’ prefix and the two prefixes are mutually exclusive. A verb conjugated in
the jussive mood has person marking before the verb root, similar to nonfuture
conjugations (see also Chapter XI) (7.82). 10

7.2.2. Person / Number
Both person and number are marked on the verb in Gumuz. This is mainly for S
and A but can also include O in NoG. All bound pronominals vary in tone according to
the valence of the verb stem (see Chapter IV) and indicate person as well as number. The
plurals are interpreted as ‘paucal’ (two to four people) in NoG. In order to indicate a
larger number of participants in NoG, one must use the ‘greater plural’ suffix in addition
to the plural (or singular) form of the bound pronominal. As Chapter IV discusses all the
various forms of the bound pronominals, the following sections focus on simultaneous A
and O marking in NoG (Section 7.2.2.1), the ‘greater plural’ in NoG (Section 7.2.2.2);
and the use of the third person plural form for passive meaning (Section 7.2.2.3).","[239, 240]"

affirmative prefix /b-/ is maintained under the same conditions as in main clause verbs

THE MA- CONSTRUCTIONThe ma- construction in Gumuz is simply a verb stem nominalized with the /ma-/
prefix. The resulting verbal noun exhibits the following structure: /ma-/ + verb stem +
/-a/ (the last item is discussed further in Chapter III, section 3.3.1.1). However, the final
/-a/ nominal marker is not always present in the ma- construction. For this reason, I
consider the ma- construction to be comprised of only the nominalizing prefix followed
by the verb stem. This construction forms the basis for many other verbal constructions in
Gumuz, namely complement clauses, the complements of auxiliaries, the progressive
construction, and negative imperatives. Adverbial clauses are also formed with the maconstruction and are discussed in Chapter X. Nominal constructions which can be formed
with the ma- construction are discussed in Chapter VI and Chapter XII.","[385, 386, 387]"

Colleen Anne Ahland
Doctor of Philosophy
Department of Linguistics
September 2012
Title: A Grammar of Northern and Southern GumuzGumuz is a Nilo-Saharan dialect cluster spoken in the river valleys of
northwestern Ethiopia and the southeastern part of the Republic of the Sudan. There are
approximately 200,000 speakers, the majority of which reside in Ethiopia. This study is a
phonological and grammatical analysis of two main dialects/languages: Northern Gumuz
and Southern Gumuz.
The study provides an overview of the Gumuz people and culture, including
historical accounts of the language(s) and migration patterns. Most major aspects of the
language are described and analyzed in detail: phonology, nouns, pronouns,
demonstratives and other noun phrase constituents, verbs and verbal morphology, noun
incorporation, verbal classifiers, noun categorization, basic clauses, and subordinate
clauses. Northern and Southern Gumuz varieties are contrasted throughout.
Gumuz tone has two levels, High and Low, with tonal downstep of High. The tonal
melody on bound pronominals on verbs indicates transitivity.
Nouns are divided into two basic types: relational and absolute. Relational nouns
have an inherent relationship with another nominal element, either within a noun-noun
compound or with a (historical) possessive affix. Two sets of relational nouns —ivattributive and relator nouns— obligatorily take an inherent possession suffix if not in a
compound.
Gumuz has two noun-noun constructions: the Associative Construction and the
Attributive Construction. The first is left-headed with ‘noun of noun’ semantics. The
second is right-headed with the initial noun expressing an inherent quality of the second.
Certain body part terms have grammaticalized as a variety of other
morphosyntactic categories, in particular as relator nouns, verbal classifiers, and class
morphemes, the final two of which are noun categorization devices. Many of these same
body part terms can be incorporated into the verb or form part of lexicalized verb-noun
compounds.
Deverbal nominalizations with /ma-/ are found throughout the language
structures. These /ma-/ nominalizations serve as both subject and object complements.
They are also commonly found in other subordinate clauses such as relative and adverbial
clauses. Purpose clauses are formed with the dative preposition plus a /ma-/
nominalization. Finite purpose clauses take pronominal inflection and have further
grammaticalized as future tense main clause verbs in Southern Gumuz.vCURRICULUM VITAE

Kamashi town and usually uses áŋ or áh for the 3SG pronoun in the corpus. A 3SG form similar to ámá
3SG -- ámé -- was documented in Yaso Gumuz (Ahland 2004:96).
2106Despite all the variations, only one personal pronoun is suspected of being
borrowed: áŋk(ʼ)o 1SG (4.2). A similar bound pronominal is found in Bertha, a
neighboring N-S language: -ɲkʼo 1SG.POSS (Benishangul-Gumuz Language
Development Project 2007:212). This pronoun is used only once in SoG as a free form
(meaning 1SG) and twice as a bound form (by a different speaker meaning 1SG.POSS) in
the present corpus.

Certain pronoun forms from Table 4.1 appear to be more phrasal, combining
bound pronominal-like forms with demonstrative adjectives. At least one of these forms
is phonologically one word (4.3). That is, there exists no tonal downstep of H tones at
the supposed morpheme boundary: dá-ná 3PL (NoG). 3 However, the speaker translated
the pronoun as a phrase: ‘these people’. When asked to produce the same clause using
‘they’, the speaker used the pronoun áχámááma.

one of these involve the bound pronominal dáá- PRO.PL which is an allomorph of the
morpheme in (4.3) (see also Chapter XII) and only occurs in NoG as part of a personal
pronoun. As dáá- PRO.PL does not occur as an independent noun in Gumuz, I will
consider these phrase-like pronouns to be equivalent to single words. Example (4.4) has
a phrasal pronoun form similar to the form in (4.3) above.","[135, 136]"

The Reverend Henning and Edith Uzar, missionaries with the German
Hermannsburg Mission or ELM, began learning and researching the Gumuz language
around the time that Unseth conducted his dialect survey. In 1989, the Reverend
published an article on the phonology as well as the tense/mode/aspect system of the
variety of Gumuz spoken where he was working, Sese. Because the consonant phoneme
chart of Unseth (1989: 617) was provided to him via personal communication, there is
practically no difference in the consonant phoneme chart from Unseth’s article.
Uzar agrees with Unseth’s analysis in regard to the labialized velar stops,
analyzing them as single segments which are allophones of their nonlabialized
counterparts (1989:354). However, he suggests modifying the morpheme-final rule to
state, “labialized velars occur in morpheme-final position except before rounded vowels.”
He further asserts that this labialization causes vowel rounding when a suffix is added,
positing the following rule (1989:355):
C+ [] --> Co, Cu
As to the syllable patterns of Gumuz, Uzar demonstrates the possible syllable
nuclei, syllable structures, and number of syllables within a single word. Like Unseth’s
analysis (Unseth 1989:625-628), Uzar shows that nasals often occupy the syllable
nucleus (1989:366). The following are the possible syllable structures he provides with
V indicating the syllable nucleus and S indicating sonorant: V, CV, CVC, CVSC, VC,
and CSV (1989:367). It should be noted that syllabic nasals only occupy the V and VC
patterns. Lastly, Uzar explains that while nouns usually consist of only one or two
syllables, verbs generally consist of three or more. He documents verbs as long as
eleven syllables (1989:367, 368).
With respect to the tense system of Gumuz, Uzar documents a remote past tense
which had not previously been described. Also, he provides evidence that Irwin’s
present-past and past completed tenses could very well be combined into one tense. He
further notes that present continuous is better interpreted as an aspect and “present
anticipation is not at all a tense” (1989:370).
17Because both Irwin and Uzar had analyzed the same variety, Sese, Uzar adds as a
disclaimer that “there remains the possibility of non-trivial dialectal differences in verb
morphology” within Gumuz (1989:370). He reduces Irwin’s three verb types to two,
labeling them split and unsplit. 20 The root in the unsplit type stays intact while the root in
the split type is interrupted by the first part of a discontinuous suffix, -aka, and is then
followed by the last part of the verb root (1989:371).
Uzar also provides data illustrating the future tense, remote past, as well as the
perfective, frequentive, and continuous aspects. In addition to tense and aspect, he
provides examples of jussive, conditional/irrealis, interrogative, and negative moods.
Lastly, Uzar provides a paradigm of person markers which seems to differ slightly from
those of Bender (1979).
Uzar (1997) is an unpublished introductory course for the Gumuz language. Even
though the intended audience is not linguists, the booklet is somewhat of a linguistic
description of the language, complete with a consonant phoneme chart, phonological
rules, morphology and syntax. In this course booklet, Uzar revises his consonant
inventory to include labialized segments, perhaps due to Unseth’s comment that he
believed the labialized velars were diachronically moving toward phonemic status in the
language. The revised analysis includes thirty-eight consonants.
Like Unseth, Uzar (1997) only posits two levels of tone for the Sese (SoG)
variety. He acknowledges, however, that sometimes a middle tone can be heard, but he
maintains that “middle tone seems to be not phonemically relevant (it is only a
predictable phonetic variant).” He subsequently gives examples of lexical items that
follow four “tone patterns:” high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high (1997:10).
As to comparative work with Gumuz dialects, Uzar provides a comparative chart
of numerals from the Gumuz spoken in Agelo Meti and Sirba Abay. He also reports that
the Gumuz in these two areas rely extensively on the numerals of a neighboring Cushitic
language, Oromo, especially for numbers higher than twenty (1997:36).","[45, 46, 47]"
"1In this and all other chapters (save Chapter XIII), I use ""S"" and ""O"" to refer to grammatical roles, not
macro-semantic categories (cf. Payne, in press). In Chapter XIII, I use ""P"" to refer to the macro-semantic
role of the most patient-like argument of the clause, which may or may not be expressed as the grammatical
object ""O"" of a clause.

"1.3.1. Gumuz Language Names
The Gumuz language and people group has been designated by a variety of
names, imposed both by outsiders and the Gumuz people themselves. Many of these
autonyms are clan names (of various levels) such as: Mendeya, Debatsa, Debuga,
Dehenda, Gunza (Dakunza, Dukunz), Domola, Funj 11 (Funyi), Disoha, Jamara, etc.
(James 1986, Lewis 2009, Ahland et al. 2002). The name Gumuz is believed to be related
to the Gunza clan mentioned above (Bender 1979), but other sources are possible. For
example, James (1981:26) suggests the word gunza ‘man’ (and not only the name of a
clan) may be the source. James also suggests that another possible source for the name
Gumuz is the 16th century kingdom of Ganz located along the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.
Other autonyms include Sese (Saysay), 12 Sai, and Bega 13 (Wallmark 1981). Monikers
imposed on them by outsiders, or exonyms, are generally considered pejorative like
Shankalla (Shanqilla, Shank’illa) used by Ethiopian highlanders, which has come to
mean ‘black slave’ (a general term referring to all dark-skinned peoples) (Pankhurst
1977); and Hamej used by Arabic speakers on the Sudanese border, which means
‘ignorant serf’ (Cerulli 1956:14) or, according to James (1981:27), simply “non-Funj”.",[39]

‘I will stab you with my uncle’s rooster’s claw.’The incorporated dative can indicate reason or cause. As question words/phrases
denoting reason or cause are formed with a dative prepositional phrase, the incorporated
preposition appears to index these causal obliques. The dative preposition is used as part
of a complex word used to express ‘why?’ and ‘because’ ká-ts(á) / kâ-nts(á) (for what?).
Consider the questions (a) and respective responses (b) in (7.116) and (7.117). The
dative /ká-/ of the question word corresponds to the dative suffix on the verb in both
(7.116a) and (7.117a). Likewise, the dative form in the answer, whether as part of the
purposive (7.116b) or part of the question word, correlates to the dative affix on the verb
of the question. Alternatively, the dative form is part of the repeated “question word” in
the answer with the meaning ‘because’ (7.117b).

‘Cat said, «I’m going to eat you because I’m dying of hunger.»’Similar use of the dative on both the question word and the verb to denote reason
is found in SoG. In (7.118a) /ká-/ [gá-] occurs on the verb and correlates with /ká-/
prepositional element of the question word ‘why?’ Again, the dative prefix occurs on the
verb in the answer, indicating ‘because’ (7.118 b, 7.119).

223In some instances, it is possible for the dative/benefactive preposition as well as
the object of the dative/benfactive to occur simultaneously on the verb. In (7.120), the
intransitive verb stem pá-ts ‘go out, emerge’ takes the incorporated dative /ká-/ along
with the object of the benefactive /íla-/ 1PL inclusive. The fully inflected verb means ‘it
came out well for us’. Similarly, in (7.121) the verb incorporates the dative preposition
along with the object of the preposition ‘me’ with the meaning ‘it is heavy for me.’(7.120)NoG

For transitive verbs (in NoG), if the dative is marked on the verb simultaneously
with the object and subject, the dative follows the pronominal marking in both the
nonfuture and future tenses (7.122-7.123). 2121The intransitive verb forms from (7.120, 7.121) were from a different consultant than the transitive verb
forms in (7.122, 7.123). Both consultants are from the Mandura area but the differences could be due to
dialect nonetheless. The incorporated dative with object form is yet again slightly different in Innocenti’s
Grammar of Mandura, where the incorporated dative is repeated at the end of the future tense verb: d-e-çər-açə-kə-ka AFF-FUT-give-1SG-2PL-DAT-DAT (parsing is my own) ‘I will give to you all’ (2010: 89). This
repeated dative is also found in verbal stems comprised of a verb root and an incorporated noun in which
the incorporated noun is found word-finally and not contiguous with the root verifying that the two dative
morphemes are indeed part of the verb: e-çʼək-ər-açə-kə-ka-s? FUT-release-1SG-2PL-DAT-DAT-MOUTH
(parsing my own) ‘Shall I release for you?’ Innocenti provides another variation of this same verb in which
the two incorporated datives exhibit yet another order: e-cʼəkʼ-ər-k-acə-ka-s? (2010: 90).","[250, 251, 252, 253]"

7.1.4. Directionals
In Nilo-Saharan languages, directionals appear to be common (Creissels et al.
2007:148), and exist in polar pairs, one referring to motion away from the deictic center,
and the other referring to motion towards deictic center. This type of verbal marking has
been referred to as ‘motion towards’ versus ‘motion away’ (Tucker and Bryan 1966),
‘ventive’ versus ‘andative’ (Rottland 1982), ‘ventive’ versus ‘itive’ (Dimmendaal 1983),
‘movement towards’ versus ‘movement away’ (Nyombe 1987), ‘centripetal’ versus
‘centrifugal’ (Andersen 1999), and ‘towards’ and ‘away’ (Payne, to appear) in that literal
motion is not always indicated in at least some languages.
For the most part, Gumuz only marks motion toward the deictic center with what
I label ‘towards’ (TWRD) /-é/. Unmarked forms of verbs are either neutral with regard to
deictic motion, or indicate motion away. Uzar (1989:374) had previously labeled this
marker a ‘speaker-oriented directional marker’ in SoG, reflecting that it can be used for
actions which take place at a different location from where the speaker is, or for actions
that start at a different location and are directed at the speaker. In addition, I have also
found that the ‘towards’ marker in Gumuz can indicate perfect aspect and distant future.
I use the label ‘away’ (AW) for motion away. This concept is generally unmarked
in Gumuz, but the suffix /-(i)ʒ/ in NoG sometimes indicates direction away from the
deictic center. However, evidence from the present corpus is conflicting and needs
further investigation.
2017.1.4.1 ‘Towards’(TWRD) Indicating ‘Motion Towards the Speaker’
As mentioned above, the ‘towards’ morpheme often indicates that an action is
performed in the direction of the speaker. This use of ‘towards’ is reserved for verbs of
motion. For example, the unmarked verb root úá [wá] ‘go (away)’ (NoG and SoG)
indicates motion away from the speaker and the marked form úá-é [wéé] ‘come’
indicates motion towards the speaker. This is also demonstrated with the verb ‘run’ in
NoG (7.55) and ‘open’ in SoG (7.56).

At times, ‘towards’ can indicate that the speaker is the recipient of an action (7.51)
or has a benefactive role (7.52). In other examples, the speaker can be construed as a
patient (7.53). The motion is therefore, metaphorically directed toward the speaker, and
not necessarily literally.

In accordance with Uzar’s (1989) findings regarding SoG, I have found that both
SoG and NoG use the ‘towards’ morpheme to indicate that an action (or predication)
takes place at a different location from that of the speaker. This use of ‘towards’ is
reserved for non-motion verbs and is a semantic shift from the original directional
(motion towards) semantics. In (7.54), the speaker is located in Ethiopia and is talking
about a child who grew up in North America. The ‘towards’ marker indicates that the
child grew up in a location other than where the speaker is located; it does not indicate
that the child is drawing near to the speaker as he grows. Similarly, in (7.55), even though
the speaker is simultaneously the A argument, the ‘towards’ morpheme occurs because
the child (the O argument) is in a different location from the speaker (7.55a). When the
location is the same, ‘towards’ cannot occur on the (non-motion) verb (7.55b). 6

verbal affixes on the grammatical end. Table 9.4 outlines this range of syntactic
behaviors. The one problem between this table and a grammaticalization continuum is
the location of ‘class morpheme’ on the continuum. Nominal class morphemes are
possibly more toward the lexical end of the continuum than are verbal classifiers but
placed in Table 9.4 based on the range of syntactic behaviors found.
The NoG variety was chosen for the data in this table as this variety includes both
complex and simple noun stems as classifiers and class morphemes. Thus, the range of
syntactic behaviors is the most extensive. All verbal classifier forms are included in Table
9.4, while only representative forms for other morphemes are included. For example,
waagá, a species of mushroom, is merely representative of all nouns which exhibit no
classifier syntax or classifying function nor can function as a head root in a NN
compound. 55 In the same way, ‘bone’ represents all nouns which can act as a head noun
in NN compound but do not form a strong class or category in the language (nor co-occur
with a verbal classifier of the same nominal origin). The ‘mouth’ and ‘place’ morphemes
are included in this table as they questionably form classes in the language. Finally,
morphemes such as cá ‘eye’, kʼwá ‘head’, -(V)ts ‘body’ (and possibly gwá ‘place’) have
grammaticalized beyond their noun classifying functions to verbal affixes which mark
various abstract and clausal arguments and have developed other syntactic functions
(discussed further in Chapters VII and X).","[358, 359]"

types 1 and 2. It is unclear whether the classifiers in Gumuz arose from noun
incorporation or whether these nouns had already grammaticalized as class morphemes
before they were incorporated. If the latter is true, one would expect the Gumuz
classifiers to be highly grammaticalized which appears to be true in some instances. Both
authors acknowledge that the difference between their types can be merely degrees of
grammaticalization with incorporated nouns towards the lexical end of the continuum and
the classifying affixes toward the grammatical end.","[363, 364]"

ábáThe variation between oodé and oor(á) ‘who?’ in SoG is due to dialectal variation
within SoG; Gumuz speakers from the Sirba variety tend to use oodé while speakers from
the Kamashi area tend to use oor(á). On the other hand, the variation between the nasal
and vowel in ats(é) / nts(é) ‘what?’8 exists for a single speaker in NoG (4.5, 4.20 4.23) . 9 It is not clear what causes this variation. When comparing constructions in
examples (4.5) and (4.20-4.22), it appears as though the nts questions a core argument (A,
S, or O), while ats questions all other (unmarked) arguments. For example, the verb ‘say’
is intransitive. Therefore, when questioning what was said, ats must be used (4.22).
However, data is sparse.

‘What is this?’It is likely that the final /-é / on these interrogative pronouns is an old copula as the final /-é / is only
found in predicate nominal constructions for ‘what?’.
89Innocenti (2010:54) also notes this variation between nts and ats in the Mandura variety (NoG).
However, Uzar (1989) only recorded the form without the nasal for the Sirba variety (SoG) ːaats(a).
Certain speakers I interviewed from Sirba Abay wereda (county) and Agelo Met’i wereda did not use nts,
only ats(á) / ats(é) to mean ‘what?’.",[142]
