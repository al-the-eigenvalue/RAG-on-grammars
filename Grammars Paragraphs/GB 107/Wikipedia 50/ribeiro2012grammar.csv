62There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negates
the entire sentence (73). It can also occur with the pro-form ♀ ado) ‘thing’ (♂ao)), forming a
negative particle which negates individual constituents of the sentence (74) and also occurs
in answers to yes/no questions (75b). The negative morpheme, followed by the imperfective
clitic, can also be used in such circumstances (75c). An emphatic morpheme, hÈkÈ (♂hÈkÈ),
occurs with ado)ko) or a verb to convey a strong negation (75d).","[73, 74]"

At any rate, although the regularity of phonological processes remains a major tenet
of historical linguistics, there are well-documented cases in which semantic or functional
factors may interfere with such regularity. A rather illustrative example is provided by
Goddard (1991:60), in discussing Cheyenne vis-à-vis Proto-Algonquian:“Cheyenne […] shows one intriguing development that is not yet explained:
*p and *k are both dropped, but only, it would seem, optionally; where
doublets can be compared, the form with retention has a diminutive meaning
beside the form with loss […]. Such doublets appear to point to the negative
semantic conditioning of a sound law, surely not a very common type of
sound change.”
Likewise, the preservation of /k/ in Karajá female speech could be seen as the result
of a negative sociolinguistic conditioning of a sound law—again, “not a very common type
of sound change”. The synchronic variations in the degree to which k-deletion takes place,
coupled with its productive application even to recent loanwords, are in themselves very
enlightening, demonstrating how a phonological rule gains a life of its own once it is invested
with a sociolinguistic function.","[176, 177]"

‘I will come.’The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionally
define an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, and
productivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence of
direction as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy
(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically that
direction “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack of
lexical generality:By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motion
verbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectional
category. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘to
take away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction is
also found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I go
across.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited175lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of some
sort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectional
status.”
Bybee’s predictions apply well to languages such as Georgian, for example, where
the opposition between the particles mo ‘hither’ and mi ‘thither’ seems to be productive only
with lexemes denoting some sort of “notional direction towards a goal” (Manning
1996:250).33 However, in Karajá all verbs inflect for direction, including those that
apparently do not indicate a motion at all, such as UrU ‘to die’ (2) and EkÈw´TE ‘to get tired’
(3), as shown by the examples below:(4)a.b.rurure

also used for other purposes. Analyzing the use of the directional markers in narrative texts,
this section explores the hypothesis that directional inflection can be used to show empathy
relationships between the participants of the speech act and between narrator and characters33The grammatical category expressed by the opposition between the particles mo and mi is called ‘orientation’
in Georgian linguistics, whereas the term ‘direction’ is used to refer to another grammatical category, which
“consists of a multi-term system of preverbs, arranged in opposed doublets such as ‘in’ versus ‘out,’ ‘up’ versus
‘down,’ etc.” (Manning, op. cit., 250) The use of the term ‘direction’ in this paper coincides with Talmy’s (op.
cit., 135) definition: “[Direction] refers to whether the Figure in a Motion event is moving toward or away from
the speaker.”
176in a narrative text, playing a role similar to what in other languages may be performed by
obviation systems, evidentials, or attitude markers.
Centrifugal direction (‘thither’) is clearly the unmarked member of the
centrifugal/centripetal opposition. Not only it can, under certain circumstances, be marked
by a zero prefix, but it is also overwhelmingly more common in narrative and descriptive
texts and everyday verbal interactions. Descriptive predicates, marked with auxiliary clitics
which present directional markers, are always marked for centrifugal direction. Furthermore,
verbs in the imperfective (marked by the clitic èr-a) cannot inflect for centripetal direction
(an exception which remains to be explained) and there seem to be pragmatic restrictions as
to the occurrence of centripetal marking with verbs in the progressive (marked with the
auxiliary clitic èr-ErI). As we will see (Section 2.2.2), such restrictions demonstrate that
direction can clearly be used with evidential purposes.","[186, 187, 188]"
"171CHAPTER 4
Morphology
1. Introduction
This chapter describes Karajá’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition to
morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Most of the chapter will be devoted to verb morphology, which is where most of
Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb inflects for person (with portmanteau
morphemes which also indicate mood), direction (which also play evidential functions), and
voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive), besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns
(sometimes with classificatory purposes). Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and
particles, respectively. As in many other lowland South American languages, nouns,
postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share person-marking paradigms. Since
postpositions have already been described in Chapter 1, and their semantic and syntactic
characteristics will be further discussed in Chapter 5, they will not be dealt with in this
chapter. Section 2 describes the inflectional properties of verbs. Section 3 deals with the
inflectional properties of nouns and briefly discusses the small class of personal pronouns,
outlining their main differences in relation to nouns. Section 4 discusses derivational
morphology, describing processes used to create new noun (Section 4.1) and verb (4.2)
stems.
Karajá, like most (if not all) Macro-Jê languages, lacks adjectives as an independent
part of speech. In languages lacking adjectives, their functions tend to be expressed by nouns
or verbs. The tendency, in Macro-Jê studies, has been to describe ‘descriptives’ (i.e., words
expressing adjectival functions) as verbs, an interpretation which has also been proposed for172Karajá (Fortune 1973, Maia 1986). Section 5 describes the morphological and syntactic
properties of such descriptive words, demonstrating that, contrary to previous claims, they
are indeed nouns.","[182, 183, 184]"
"8. A brief grammatical sketch
7Among the Xambioá, I interviewed all of the fluent speakers (a total of 8, by the time of my last visit (1998)),
to check for the possibility of dialectal variation (since their population is a result of the gathering of different
local groups) and whether there were signs of language obsolescence.
23As an introduction to the language’s main aspects, this section presents a sketch of
Karajá, succinctly describing phenomena which will receive an in-depth treatment in the
following chapters and offering an overview of grammatical aspects which will only be dealt
with briefly in this dissertation (such as negation and interrogation).","[34, 35]"

‘You better stay, for I’m going far.’Maia (2002:155) analyzes ♂ èdori as a ‘focus marker,’ which is probably a mistake:
being a second-position clitic, it is not surprising that this morpheme occurs after fronted
elements, but that is also the case of most discourse-oriented particles in the language (see
Chapter 4). Fortune (1970) translates it (rightly, I think) as ‘because.’ As a second-position
clitic, èdokuri attaches to the first constituent of the clause, regardless of its syntactic status.
In (79) above, èdokuri attaches to a postpositional phrase. The examples below illustrate its
occurrence with noun phrases (81) and a predicate (82):(81)♂b´-d-a-lOèkE,biuèdori255k´-d-∅-Oaèk´re2-CTPT-INTR-enter=POT

‘I won’t go, because it is dangerous.’
In fact, its distribution and phonological behavior suggest that èdokuri belongs in the
large class of speech-act particles, that inform on the attitude of the speaker with relation to
the utterance (indicating certainty, doubt, excitement, boredom, sympathy, surprise,
assertiveness, resolve, etc.). As other speech act clitics, èdokuri is unstressed; notice that,
unlike adpositions, èdokuri does not change the stress of the verb phrase to which it attaches;
thus, i-Oha)ruèr-eèdori ‘because it is dangerous’ is pronounced [iOha)""ruredori].
Analyzing èdokuri as a speech act clitic helps us to understand the differences
between dokuri-clauses and the reason clauses described above: dokuri-clauses are probably
examples of speech act adverbial clauses, whose function, as defined by Thompson &
Longacre (1985:203) “is not to modify or qualify the main clause in any way, but to modify
or qualify, as it were, the speech act which the speaker is performing in uttering the main
clause.” In fact, most attitude markers can be seen as speech-act subordinators to a certain
extent, since they anchor the utterance to a previous one; in an example such as (83) below,
the attitude markers èTOE ‘enthusiasm’ and èT´) ‘repetition’ can only be interpreted in
reference to a previous speech act (it was jokingly said as a warning to a child who insisted in
climbing a tree against a parent’s repeated admoestation):(83)b´-d-∅-UrUèkreèTOEèT´)

‘[As I have warned you before,] you will die [deservedly].’2567. Nominalized complementsCorresponding roughly to the subordinate clauses described above, one commonly
finds nominalized forms of the verbs playing the role of complements. Deverbal nouns may
be preceded by a grammatical possessor which corresponds to the original absolutive
argument of the verb—that is, to the subject of an intransitive verb, such as in wa-rira ‘my
walking’ (from ♀ rika ~ ritSa ‘to walk’), or to the object of a transitive verb, such as inkOÎUd¸) b´)d´) ‘turtle catching.’ (from b´) ‘to catch’). These constructions occur in any of the
functions performed by subordinate clauses (or by any NP, for that matter)—that is, as
subjects (84), direct objects (85) or objects of postpositions (86-91):(84)♀∅-r-I-wa-d-EkÈw´TE-d´)èr-a

In addition, the suffix -dU forms subject nouns (that is, nouns refering to the subject of the
original verb), which can be translated as relative clauses (92). The suffix -da), on the other
hand, forms nouns which name instruments, places, or other circumstances related to the
action denoted by the verb (r´T´)-da) ‘food’ < r´T´) ‘to eat’; kOra-da) ‘shredder’ < kOka ‘to
shred’; TUrO-da) ‘soap (or any washing device)’ < TUhO ‘to wash’).","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"5. Adverbial clausesKarajá apparently has few, if any, true adverbial clauses, a fact that mirrors the
overall lack of adverbs in the language.19 Corresponding to locative adverbs (‘here’, ‘there’,
‘hither’, ‘thither’) and temporal adverbs (‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’), Karajá has demonstrative
pronouns (ka ‘proximal’, k´da) ‘distal’) followed by postpositions (kaèkI ‘here’; ♀ kaèku, ♂kaèu ‘yesterday’; ♀ k´da)èku, ♂ k´da)èu ‘the day before yesterday; the day after tomorrow’).
Corresponding to manner adverbs (‘quickly’, ‘swiftly,’ etc.), Karajá has nouns followed by
the postposition èb´) (wÈèb´) ‘quickly,’ etc.). Thus, just as most adverbial functions are
played by postpositional phrases, functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses are
played by ‘postpositional clauses’ in Karajá. Below are examples of allative, locative, and
temporal clauses:(51)♀i-r´bI a-hEèb´)

‘You may keep on going to where I followed you from.’
19One candidate for adverbhood would be widZi ‘today, now’. The locative morphemes ÎU, Îab´), and Îai
(which, as we have seen, are suppletive third-person forms of postpositions) could also be alternatively
analyzed as adverbs. Even if these morphemes are considered as adverbs, this would be a closed class in
Karajá.

Notice that the adverbial-like subordinate clauses above are structurally identical to
relative clauses which modify oblique domain nouns (as seen in Section 3 above), except for
the lack of a domain noun. That is, the locative clauses above can be analyzed as headless
relative clauses. This structural identity between relative clauses and adverbial clauses is not
unusual. As Thompson & Longacre (1985:179) point out, adverbial clauses expressing time,
location, and manner can commonly be paraphrased, in many languages, “with a relative
clause with a generic and relatively semantically empty head noun: time, place, and
way/manner, respectivelly;” such clauses have also in common the fact that they can be
replaced by a single word, an adverb, such as today (time), here (location), and quickly
(manner) in English and other languages with a clear class of adverbs.","[253, 254]"
"8.7 Attitude markersKarajá presents a number of discourse-oriented particles, indicating mostly the
attitude of the speaker in relation to what he or she is uttering—examples of which are èkOrI57‘admiration, surprise’, èT´) ‘boredom, repetitiveness’, èTO ‘excitement’, èlǨhǨ ‘compassion’,
and èkOT´d´) ‘doubt’. These attitude markers (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 161) are, in general,
unstressed, and appear cliticized to the first syntactic constituent of the sentence. Their
distribution is exemplified by the particle èTO in the example below:(65)a.","[68, 69]"
"4. Complementation15The fact that Maia does not signal any pause between both sentences corroborates my analysis of these
examples as cases of subordination, not juxtaposition of two independent clauses (‘the man threw the arrow; he
saw the guariba monkey’), which would be a rather odd construction in Karajá, given the lack of particles
marking any type of relation between the last clause and the preceding one.
16
Maia’s original transcriptions of these examples are (i) weriri Dolora dewinade kau awire and (ii) Hãbu wyhy
rehura asynihiky-my robina. In addition to the overall shortcomings of Karajá orthography, Maia’s
transcription also presents some inaccuracies of its own. For example, the verb ehu ‘to throw’ takes objects
marked with the instrumental postposition èdI, never a ‘bare’ object as Maia’s transcription suggests. This and
other inaccuracies are corrected in (41) and (42) above.
239Complement clauses are those which occupy the position of a noun phrase, occuring
as arguments of the verb or as objects of postpositions. Like relative clauses, complement
clauses in Karajá are also characterized by stress shift. In (43) below, the subordinate clause
is the subject of the main clause, whereas in (44), the subordinate clause is the object of the
verb ♀ kErÈ, ♂ ErÈ ‘to know’.","[250, 251]"

sentence (80).",[76]

analysis has shown that they are, in fact, clitics (Ribeiro 1996). As such, they can attach to
any element occurring as a predicate, including postpositional phrases (66), pronouns (67),
and nouns (68):(66)♂waÎau

‘It is said that, in the old times, lightning bugs were the fire of mankind.’Auxiliaries and particles belong to clearly-distinct grammatical categories, based on
semantic, morphological, and distributional criteria. Semantically, particles are more
properly described as modals (future, potential), while auxiliaries are more properly
described as aspectual markers (progressive, perfective, imperfective). Morphologically,
particles are invariable, while auxiliaries are inflected, forming a defective sub-class of verbs.
Furthermore, auxiliaries and particles can co-occur (a fact which was not mentioned in any
previous description of Karajá), demonstrating that they both occupy different positional
slots in the complex verbal word. Although the differences between èr-a and èr-e are
traditionally described as one of remoteness (‘recent past’ vs. ‘remote past’, respectively) by
both Fortune and Maia, that is certainly an inadequate characterization, given that èr-e59occurs mainly in descriptive constructions, narratives (as a sort of historical present), and
even to denote future events (signaling habituality, versus punctuality; cf. (69d)). Chapter 4
further discusses the semantics of the temporal-aspectual morphemes. A habitual morpheme,èb´)h´), resulting from the grammaticalization of a converb construction, will be described in
Chapter 5.","[69, 70, 71]"
"8. Final remarksKarajá presents a pervasive and straightforward mechanism to create subordinate clauses,
shared by relative, complement, and ‘adverbial’ clauses alike. This device is clause
nominalization: an entire clause is nominalized and, as such, can occur in all the positions
traditionally occupied by noun phrases (including subject and direct objects, objects of
postpositions, and noun modifiers). Clause nominalization (a syntactic process) differs from
lexical nominalization (a morphological process) in a number of ways, the main one being
that the former preserves all the inflectional properties of the verb. With subordinate clauses
occuring in the position of a bare nominal (that is, a noun phrase not followed by
28Notice that in both nominalizing suffixes, -dV and -TV, ‘V’ is a copy of the last vowel in the verb stem.
260postpositions or an article), the subordinate status of the clause is indicated by stress shift, an
interesting case of non-concatenative morphology which went unnoticed in previous
descriptions of Karajá grammar.","[271, 272]"

‘four Xavánte spirits’spirit9. Table of contentsAs I intended to show in this introduction, many aspects of Karajá phonology,
morphology, and syntax (as well as its peculiar system of gender deixis) remain to be
thoroughly understood. However, even a succinct overview of the language reveals a
number of phenomena rich in theoretical and descriptive implications. It is my hope that this
dissertation will provide us with a better understanding not only of the Karajá language, but
also of the general analytical questions its study raises. The following chapters provide an in
depth description of phenomena which are central to the understanding of Karajá.
Chapter 1 provides a thorough account of the language’s phonological inventory,
syllable and stress patterns, and morphophonology. A major difference between the account
given here and those offered in previous sources lies in the vocalic inventory: here it is
shown that the feature [ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’ plays a central role in Karajá
phonology, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony--the first of this kind ever
described for a South American language. [ATR]-ness is also relevant in describing the
second-most common morphophonemic process in the language, palatalization.
Reduplication, maybe the most phonologically-oriented of all word-formation processes, will
also be treated in this chapter.
Chapter 2 deals with an oft-mentioned—yet poorly understood—peculiarity of
Karajá: the existence of systematic differences between male and female speech. As
suggested early on by Ehrenreich (1894), female speech is more conservative, male speech69being generally characterized by the deletion of the velar stop /k/. However, although such
‘genderlectal’ differences are often described as being the result of regular phonological
processes, they can have morphological consequences as well—a fact that went unnoticed in
previous descriptions. The chapter also includes an account of male vs. female speech
distinctions in Javaé, where genderlectal variation is much less prominent (Javaé women
speaking what seems to be a relaxed version of the male speech in the other dialects). A
possible explanation for such a situation, based on a well-documented case of language
contact involving the Javaé, is proposed. Hypotheses on the possible diachronic origins of the
male vs. female speech distinctions are also discussed. Contrary to previous suggestions,
according to which they would be contact-induced (Rodrigues 1999, 2004), the facts seem to
favor an explanation in terms of the language’s own internal historical tendencies.
Chapter 3 describes the language’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition
to morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Verb morphology is where most of Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb
inflects for person (with portmanteau morphemes which also indicate mood), direction
(which also play evidential functions), and voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive),
besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns (sometimes with classificatory purposes).
Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and particles, respectively. As in many other
lowland South American languages, nouns, postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share
person-marking paradigms. Comparative evidence plays an important role in explaining
less-than-transparent morphological devices, such as linking prefixes (which, as it turns out,
are cognates with similar prefixes in other Macro-Jê languages), synchronically invariable
roots with fossilized prefixes, and a non-concatenative mechanism to derive nouns from70verbs. The latter constitute an unusual case of replacive infixation, which, thanks to
comparative evidence, can be traced back to the affixation of a nominalizing suffix.
Chapter 4 deals with complex sentences. Subordinate clauses in Karajá are always the
result of sentential nominalizations, not only in the cases of relative and complement clauses,
but of adverbial clauses as well. It is here claimed that adverbs in Karajá do not exist as an
independent part-of-speech (or, at least, constitute a marginal part-of-speech with very few
members), adverbial functions being played by postpositional phrases. Consequently,
adverbial clauses are postpositional clauses, marked by the same postpositions which mark
nouns. Their use as subordination markers mirrors their use with nouns, even in the case of
converbs—by far, the most common type of subordinate clauses--, which are marked by a
locative postposition. Considering the role they play with adverbial clauses, postpositions are
described in this chapter. A case of discourse (rather than grammatical) subordination, the
=dokuri clause, will also be described in this chapter.
The last chapter, Chapter 5, provides an appraisal of the evidence for the inclusion of
Karajá in the Macro-Jê stock, taking into consideration additional evidence uncovered by the
present study, informed by recent improvements in the reconstruction of Proto-Jê (Ribeiro
2005). Although a relationship between Karajá and the Jê family had been suggested early
by von den Steinen (1884), Karajá was one of the last languages to be included in the MacroJê stock (Davis 1968). As its late inclusion in the stock suggests, the similarities between
Karajá and other Macro-Jê languages are far from obvious. The evidence presented by Davis,
however, is being further corroborated by additional data, as this chapter hopefully
demonstrates. Especially compelling for the hypothesis of genetic relationship are those
instances in which comparative evidence helps explain synchronic irregularities of Karajá, as71in the case of the replacive infix. The chapter demonstrates the interplay between descriptive
and historical linguistics: on the one hand, it shows how a better descriptive knowledge of a
language may contribute to uncover additional pieces of comparative evidence; on the other,
it shows how a better comparative knowledge may contribute to improve our understanding
of synchronic phenomena.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"Lastly, I would like to thank my professors at the University of Chicago, to whom I owe any
merits this dissertation may have. Many of the ideas in this dissertation grew out of classes I
took with Jerry Sadock, Amy Dahlstrom, Michael Silverstein, Salikoko Mufwene, John
Goldsmith, Kostas Kazazis, Anthony Buccini, and Gunnar Hansson, among others. Chicago
provided me with a deeper understanding of the value of theoretical diversity and with a set
of analytic tools which I will forever cherish in my career as a linguist. I was particularly
fortunate to have in my dissertation committee linguists who, while having solid reputations
as theoretical linguists, equally value data-oriented linguistic analysis: Amy Dahlstrom, Jerry
Sadock, and Michael Silverstein. I am particularly indebted to Amy Dahlstrom, not only for
her contributions to my education as a linguist, but also for her kind support and
encouragement, without which this dissertation would not have come to light.viiABBREVIATIONS

INTRODUCTION1. The Iny and their languageThe main purpose of this dissertation is to provide an introductory grammar of Karajá, a
Macro-Jê language spoken along the Araguaia River, in Central Brazil. Karajá has three
mutually-intelligible dialects—Karajá proper, Javaé, and Xambioá. Karajá proper can be
further divided into Northern and Southern Karajá. Combined, the four dialects have a total
of approximately three thousand speakers (Silva 2009), in the Brazilian states of Goiás, Mato
Grosso, Tocantins, and Pará. The dissertation takes into account data of all four dialects,
collected by the author in several field trips. Except for the Xambioá dialect, Karajá is quite
vigorous in sociolinguistic terms, being the first language to be learned by the children and
the language used in everyday life in nearly all of the villages.
Speakers of the four different dialects refer to their people as Iny [i""n´)] ‘people, human’,
and to their language as Iny Rybe [i""n´) rÈ""bE]. Ethnographic naming practices follow in part
the point of view of the Karajá proper, who call their northernmost kin iS´)bIkOwa
‘companion people’ (iS´) ‘people’ + bIkOwa ‘friend, companion’), whence the Portuguese
word Xambioá. Despite their obvious linguistic and cultural communion, the Karajá refer to
the Javaé as iS´)dZu, a term generally reserved for non-Karajá Indians such as the Xavánte.
As we will see (Chapter 2), such attitude has less to do with linguistic differences than with
cultural and historical ones. The Javaé, on the other hand, call the remaining Karajáberohok´) maha)dU ‘the people of the big river [i.e. the Araguaia]’. Non-Indians are called1Îori or, less-commonly, weku or w´l´ (words whose etymologies are unknown).
Bilingualism is very common among the men, who frequently visit the neighboring towns in
order to trade fish and other commodities; some (including entire families) travel even
farther, seeking education or medical treatment.
In this introduction, I provide background information on the language and its
speakers: Section 2 describes the geographic location of the Karajá-speaking tribes; Section 3
discusses the language’s genetic affiliation; Section 4 describes contacts with speakers of
different languages; Section 5 offers a brief appraisal of previous scholarship on Karajá
language and culture; Section 6 describes basic dialectal differences; Section 7 briefly
discusses the circumstances surrounding the collection and elicitation of the data on which
the present dissertation is based. The introduction concludes with a brief grammatical sketch
of the language (Section 8) and a narrative table of contents (Section 9).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

‘become dry’Since the velar stop is generally suppressed in male speech, the formal identity
between the verb root and the deverbal noun can be rather obfuscated. For example,
although the verb roots ♀ aka ‘to run’ and ♀ ka ‘to dig’ may become homophonous in male138speech (♂ a), their deverbal nouns will still differ: ara ‘the action of running’ versus ra ‘the
action of digging’. Therefore, a regular derivational rule can only be identified if the female
speech is taken into consideration.93.2. d-droppingThis process consists in the deletion in the male speech of an alveolar nasal consonant
occurring in the corresponding female speech form. It seems to involve only two morphemes9A misunderstanding of the male-female speech distinctions may also lead to erroneous ethnographic
statements. Thus, Donahue (1982), appraising the antiquity of Karajá agriculture, suggests that the Karajá word
for ‘corn’ entered the Karajá lexicon through a European language, and that, therefore, the cultivation of this
product was a recent introduction into Karajá culture:
The Karajá word for corn is mai, which happens also to be the French word for corn, both
surely derived from maize, a word of Carib [sic] origin. It could well be that corn was
introduced to the Karajá by Europeans after contact, an interesting case of circuitous
diffusion. If such an American staple of corn were introduced by Europeans, it might indicate
that the Karajá have come to horticulture quite a bit later than many other central Brazilian
tribes. [Donahue 1982: 83]Donahue would probably have reached a different conclusion if the female speech form, ba)ki [ma""ki] (which, as
Ehrenreich suggests, represents “an older form of the idiom”), were taken into consideration. Another example
is the analysis of Javaé sexuality suggested by anthropologist Patrícia Rodrigues (1993), based on the mistaken
assumption that the words for ‘vagina’ and ‘skin’ were homophonous:
“[…] the fact that tyky means both ‘skin’, ‘clothes’, and one of the words for ‘body’, and also
‘vagina’, could mean that, contrary to western conception, which restrict sexuality to the
genital organs, the Javaé would understand the whole female body as an extension of the
vagina, an eroticized whole. The skin that covers the entire body would be as eroticized and
permeated with sexuality as the genital organ, a notion that transforms the woman (as
wife/sexual partner) into a sexual being […], as a whole, and not only as a possessor of sexual
anatomic parts.” [Rodrigues 1993: 312]
Interesting as it may sound, this hypothesis does not find any support in the linguistic data. In fact, the words
for ‘skin’ and ‘vagina’ may become homophonous in the male speech, but only when pronounced in isolation.
Since there is a constraint against surface monosylabic words, the word for ‘vagina’, ÎÈ, will be pronounced as
ÎÈÈ when occurring by itself, and, given the phonological processes described above, the word for ‘skin,
clothes’, Î´kÈ (ÎÈkÈ, in Javaé and Xambioá) may be optionally pronounced as ♂ ÎÈÈ. Homophony between these
two words is limited to these cases. They never become homophonous in the female speech. Even in male
speech, they will never become homophonous when combined with other morphemes: i-ÎÈ ‘her vagina’, i-ÎÈÈ
‘her/his/its skin, clothes’.
139(which may be etymologically related): the clitic indefinite article ♀ èdo) [no)] (♂ o)), and the
pro-form ♀ ado) [a""no)] ‘something’ (♂ ao)). The indefinite article attaches to entire noun
phrases (13). The pro-form ♀ ado) generally occurs in combination with emphatic,
interrogative, and discourse particles (14). It also occurs in combination with the
nominalizer suffix -da) (15)10.","[149, 150, 151]"

‘It will rain (and that’s great).’8.8 TenseTense does not occur as an inflectional category in Karajá. Instead, tense distinctions are
encoded by temporal-aspectual auxiliaries and particles that cliticize to the main verb. As
with main verbs, the auxiliaries -ErI ‘progressive’, -a ‘perfective’, and -e ‘imperfective’
inflect for direction (and, in the second person, also for person), as shown by the examples
above. The particles èk´re ‘future’, èkE ‘potential’, and èhEd´) ‘admonitory’, restricted to
the irrealis mood, are invariable.",[69]
"243In Karajá, however, not only temporal, locative, and manner adverbial notions are
expressed through postpositional clauses. As we will see below, purpose, conditional, and
reason adverbial clauses, as well as converbs (subordinate clauses denoting a wide range of
circumstantial meanings), are also constructed with postpositions. Thus, (notional) adverbial
clauses in Karajá can be seen as complement clauses occupying the NP node in a
postpositional phrase, being structurally identical with both relative and complement clauses.","[254, 255]"
"3.6 Use of female speech by men, and vice-versaExamples in which the k-dropping rule may or may not apply cannot be confused
with cases in which a male speaker deliberately uses female speech forms. In fact, as in
Koasati (Haas 1964) and Yana (Sapir 1949), female and male speakers can use each other’s
speech forms when ‘impersonating’ a character of the opposite sex, such as when narrating a
story or baby-sitting. Thus, if a male speaker is, for example, quoting a female character or
baby-talking to his daughter, he will use plain female speech in doing so.16 Inversely,
women will use male speech forms when quoting a male character or baby-talking to a baby
boy. The use of female speech by a male speaker is further illustrated by the sentence below,16A very interesting question to be investigated is when and how are the distinctions between female and male
speech learned by the child. According to Fortune & Fortune (1975:115), “at about age three, mothers start
insisting in the Karajá tribe that boys use only men’s speech. This is the beginning of the socialization process
which continues until the adult male is admitted to the men’s house where no young initiate would ever use
women’s speech.” However, the observance of the female-male speech differences in baby-talk suggests that
these distinctions start being acquired much earlier.

with the bandeirantes. Although most authors agree on its Tupí-Guaraní origin—in Guaraní,
it refers to a large monkey species, called guariba in Portuguese--, its precise provenance is
rarely discussed. It so happens that a cognate of the Guaraní word is not found in any of the
Amazonian Tupí-Guaraní languages with which the Karajá were likely in contact. Its
occurrence is restricted to southern Tupí-Guaraní languages such as Guaraní and Sirionó
(Mello 2000). Baldus (1948) suggests that such an epithet is also due to the bandeirantes,7speakers of Língua Geral Paulista. Although a similar word was not documented for Old
Tupí, it is not unlikely that it may have occurred in Língua Geral Paulista, since the Tupí of
São Vicente was described as having been influenced by Guaraní (maybe forming a link in a
continuum between Guaraní and Tupinambá). Furthermore, one of the main economic
occupations of the bandeirantes was raiding the Jesuit missions among the Guaraní in the
south, in current-day Paraguay, where they could very well have adopted the word. Also of
uncertain origin, the term Javaé may have come from a Tupí-Guaraní language as well (cf.
Kaapór sawa'e 'man'; Kakumasu & Kakumasu 2007:50).
Fonseca’s visit marks a turning point in the relationship between the government and
the Karajá. The governors of Goiás were now interested in bringing the Indian tribes under
the watchful eye of the government, through the creation of official settlements
(aldeamentos) gathering different ethnic groups, generally away from their traditional
territories (such as São José dos Mossâmedes, located south of Vila Boa). Hundreds of Javaé
and Southern Karajá would agree to join the aldeamentos, only to later abandon them
because of widespread death by disease and mistreatments. Closer to the indigenous
territories, the government would create presidios, military outposts which would be often
attacked and destroyed by the Karajá and Javaé (allied with other indigenous tribes such as
the Xerénte). Despite such opposition, aldeamentos and presidios would gradually contribute
to the weakening of native resistence. In 1850, the presídio of Leopoldina was founded near
the mouth of the Vermelho River. Though destroyed and rebuilt more than once, the presídio
signals a permanent official presence in Southern Karajá territory. With the consolidation of
Leopoldina, later a town (today’s Aruanã), the Karajá were now in closer contact with the
national, Portuguese-speaking population. An increased Brazilian presence in the Araguaia,8both in Leopoldina and in Southern Pará (near the territories of the Xambioá and Northern
Karajá) also meant that it was safer for naturalists, such as Castelnau, and ethnographers,
such as Ehrenreich, to travel up and down the river, contacting the Karajá and collecting
information on their language and culture. In most of its extension, however, the Araguaia
was still free from permanent Brazilian settlements, a situation which would last well into the
20th century. Despite initial attempts to increase the commercial use of the Araguaia, with
the creation of steamboat lines in the second half of the 19th century, such initiatives were
short-lived. Although limiting the influx of large waves of colonists, the lack of economic
prosperity did not mean an end to the Karajá’s troubles. The Xambioá, once described as the
most prosperous and numerous among the Karajá-speaking groups (Ehrenreich 1891), would
come close to extinction, victims of military actions and epidemics (Toral 1992). In the
beginning of the 20th century, there were only a few scattered Xambioá families, which
would later be gathered by the SPI (Serviço de Proteção ao Índio), a forerunner of FUNAI.
These families are the ancestors of the current-day Xambioá. Due to such drastic population
decline and their geographic distance from the other Karajá villages, the Xambioá married
local Brazilians. Karajá language and culture would gradually lose ground, in such a way
that the Xambioá dialect is now nearing extinction, with only a handful of elderly speakers.
Starting in the 1930s, a new political climate brought a renewed interest in colonizing
the region west of the Araguaia. This “March to the West” (Marcha para o Oeste) would
result in an ever-growing presence of cattle ranches in indigenous territory, and the founding
of towns such as Luciara (near Northern Karajá villages in the north of the Bananal Island),
Santa Terezinha do Araguaia (near the Southern Karajá village of São Domingos, or
Krehãwa), and São Félix do Araguaia (near the Southern Karajá village of Santa Isabel do9Morro, or Hãwalò). Roads and a brand new city—Goiânia—would be built, attracting even
more newcomers to Central Brazil. Airplanes would bring adventurers and journalists from
Rio and São Paulo, who fascinated their readers with stories of untamed nature and men.
Even two of Brazil’s most enterprising and popular presidents, Getúlio Vargas (1940) and
Juscelino Kubitschek (1960), would visit the Karajá village of Santa Isabel do Morro. The
rush of activity in the region, this time, was more than a mere phase, bringing lasting changes
and additional challenges for the Karajá, who were now in permanent contact with an evergrowing Brazilian population. But, after centuries of dealing with the newcomers, the Karajá
had learned to survive their intrusion, managing to preserve their own culture—as well as
much of their traditional land—against all odds.
Both before and after the arrival of the European colonizer, the Karajá were also in
contact with neighboring tribes, or tribes who would eventually make incursions into the
Araguaia. Of these, contacts with the Tapirapé (♀ woku, ♂ wou), a Tupí-Guaraní tribe, were
certainly the most important, for having resulted in mutual, lasting cultural influences.
Traditional inhabitants of the upper course of the Tapirapé River (a western tributary of the
Araguaia), the Tapirapé would seasonally frequent the region at the mouth of the Tapirapé
River, where they would trade (and occasionally fight) with the Northern Karajá. Occupying
the main course of a major river, the Karajá would act as intermediates between the
Brazilians and the Tapirapé, exchanging old iron tools for Tapirapé goods. As Baldus points
out, the Karajá traditionally acted as purveyors of “chants, tools, and epidemics” to the
Tapirapé (Baldus 1970:65). The Tapirapé, on the other hand, would provide the Karajá with
agricultural products and tamed macaws (whose feathers are prized for their ornamental
value). The loans exchanged between both languages reflect not only the economic expertise10of each tribe (Tables 1.2 and 1.3), but also the exchange of ritual elements. A few Karajá
loans, such as the words for ‘banana’ and ‘White man’, occur not only in Tapirapé, but also
in Asuriní of Tocantins and Parakanã, closely-related Tupí-Guaraní languages whose

"2.2 Temporal constructions7As in English or Portuguese, the verb aha ‘to find’ is also used with an ‘evaluative’ meaning (as in I found the
play annoying). In this case, the evaluative phrase is marked by the postposition èb´):

229The semantics of some postpositions can be further illustrated by their use in
temporal constructions. In addition to the temporal postposition proper, èku, locative èb´)
and instrumental èdI were also attested in temporal uses: rukuèb´) ‘at night’, rukuèdI ‘at
dawn’; bikuraTOèku ‘in the morning’, bikuraTOèb´) ‘tomorrow’; etc. The use of èdI
‘instrumental’ in rukuèdI ‘at dawn’ (literally, ‘after night’) mirrors its use with subordinate
clauses such as (22) below:(22)k´-d-∅-EhEb´)d´)èkreèdI
a-r-∅-aèkre
3-CTPT-INTR-arrive=FUTèINSTR 1-CTFG-go=FUT
‘After he arrives, I will go.’3. Relative clausesFor the sake of terminological clarity, I will adopt here the basic terminology
employed by Keenan (1985). Like Keenan, I regard relative clauses to be full NPs (a fact that
is rather clear in Karajá, where relative clauses can take articles, as we have seen, and
postpositions, as it will be shown below). As Keenan points out, a relative clause typically
consists of a common noun (or a pronoun), the domain noun, optionally accompanied by
determiners, and a restrictive clause: “Semantically the common noun determines a class of
objects, which we shall call the domain of relativization, and the restrictive clause identifies a
subset of the domain, those elements which satisfy the conditions given by the restrictive
clause” (Keenan 1985: 142). Thus, in Îori dOrOède! ‘a White man who arrived’, Îori ‘White
man’ is the domain noun, and dOrOède! ‘who arrived’ is the restrictive clause.
As we have seen, the only surface difference between the independent clause in (1)
and its subordinate counterpart in (2) is in the location of the stress: [Îo""ri do""rode] ‘the White230man came ashore’ versus [Îo""ri doro""de] ‘the White man who came ashore’. In fact, stress
shift is the basic mechanism to mark the subordinate status of relative clauses that modify
core NPs (that is, subjects and direct objects). That the subordinate clause occupies the
position of an NP is further demonstrated by the fact that it can be followed by the enclitic
indefinite article ♀ èdo), ♂ èo) (24), which attaches to the rightmost element of an NP (23). In
addition, an NP modified by a subordinate clause can still act as a possessor, and, in these
cases, the possessed noun will occur after the subordinate clause (25).9 Notice that the
relative clause is postnominal, occurring after the modified noun. This fact, as we will see
(Section 6), reflects the general distribution of modifiers in attributive constructions.","[240, 241, 242]"
"3.4. Exceptions, obligatoriness, and variation142Although it is a very productive process, applying even to loanwords, there are a few
exceptions to the k-dropping rule. These are mainly grammatical words, such as the personal
pronoun kai ‘you’, the demonstratives ka ‘this’, kua ‘that (far from both the speaker and the
addressee)’, and kia ‘that (close to the addressee)’, the locative postposition èkI, the verb
particles èk´re ‘future marker’ and èkE ‘potential marker’, and discourse markers, such as
èr´kI ‘narrative’. I am not aware of any noun or verb roots constituting absolute exceptions
to the k-dropping rule.
Although the previous studies do mention the existence of such exceptions, they fail
to notice a very remarkable fact. Even among the words for which the k-dropping rule is
possible there are differences concerning the degree of obligatoriness with which the
differentiation takes place. That is, while for some words k-dropping is obligatory, for others
it is optional. According to this criterion, words presenting a velar stop may be classed into
three different categories: (a) absolute exceptions, that is, words for which the deletion of /k/
does not occur at all; (b) words for which the k-dropping rule is optional; (c) words for which
the k-dropping rule is obligatory.13 Tables 3, 4, and 5 below show examples of members of
each class:Table 3.3. Class a: absolute exceptions to the rule of k-dropping

ruÎǨThat these differences do not relate to criteria such as morphological status or part-ofspeech is shown by the fact that each of the three subject pronouns behaves in a different
way. For the first person pronoun, k-dropping is obligatory: ♀ dIkar´), ♂ dIar´). The second
person pronoun, kai, belongs to the small class of absolute exceptions. Finally, for the third
person pronoun, Î´kI, k-dropping is optional. The same assumption is also valid for the
postpositions: while the locative postposition èkI belongs to Class a, the dative postpositiond´kE belongs to Class b, and the temporal postposition èku to Class c. Finally, the same
differences in behavior occur with affixes: although k-dropping is obligatory with the first
person irrealis prefix ka-, it is optional with the third person irrealis prefix k´-.
Furthermore, the k-dropping rule does not apply equally to all the occurrences of the
velar stop in a given word. If two adjacent syllables in the same word contain a /k/, the144tendency is that only one of its occurrences will be deleted, generally the first one: ♀ kOka
‘to shred’ (♂ Oka); ♀ kukO ‘to lift’ (♂ ukO). It is plausible that at least some of these
restrictions are due to phonological constraints, such as to limit the number of vowels in a
row. Also, at least some cases of obligatory male-female speech differentiation can be stated
in phonological terms. Thus, the velar stop seems to be always deleted when occurring
before /u/. Thus, in the male speech form corresponding to ♀ kowoku ‘mortar’, k-dropping
is obligatory in the last syllable, but optional in the first (♂ kowo, owo).14 The deletion of
the velar stop seems to be generally optional in the cases described in section 2.1.2, which
involve schwa assimilation. On the other hand, differentiation is always obligatory in the
cases described in section 2.1.1 above, in which vowel fusion takes place (♀ bEraku ‘river’,
♂ bero), and in section 2.1.3, involving epenthesis (♀ ikOrO ‘fox’, ♂ idZOrO). Thus, the
differentiation between male and female speech seems to be obligatory exactly in those cases
in which the differences between the words in both gender dialects are more salient.
Some morphemes seem to be on the borderline between Class a and Class b. That is
the case of the ‘augmentative’ morpheme -hVk´), which generally preserves the velar stop in
the male speech, such as in ♀ berohok´) [river-big] ‘great river (the Araguaia)’, ♂bErakuhuk´). Although this morpheme may occasionally occur without the velar stop in the
speech of some individuals, this is very sporadic, and considered wrong by the majority of
the speakers. Therefore, although the classification suggested here accounts for the behavior14Therefore, examples such as kowoku ‘mortar’ belong simultaneously to classes b and c.
145of most of the Karajá lexicon, one has to keep in mind the influence of factors such as
hypercorrection in the performance of individual speakers and the impact analogy may have
had in the development of such distinctions.
Thus, there is a great deal of variation in the pronunciation of Class b words, not only
among different speakers, but even in the speech of the same individual. A good example of
the variation in the use of Class b words occurs in the examples below, from a text narrated
by a Northern Karajá man, in which both forms of the verb Î´ka ‘to tie’ occur in the same
sequence:(16)Îar´kI´n´)SiwEirOdU dErarIÎ´kare,Îaèr´kI

‘Then Kynyxiwè tied the arms of the animals, and tied the deer with a rope.’
Therefore, forms such as Î´ka should be better considered as neutral in terms of
female versus male speech distinctions, since they do not necessarily indicate anything about
the sex of the speaker. Thus, while (17a) is clearly a female speech form and (17b) is clearly
a male speech form, (17c) can occur in the speech of both males and females. Thus, male
speech is characterized by a higher degree of variation, which is not available in the female
speech.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

There are two basic interrogative morphemes in Karajá, èbo and èwE; both seem to
be used interchangeably, though èbo tends to be more common. They combine with the proforms ♂ado) (♂ao)) ‘thing’, bo) ‘human’, and ÎI ‘circumstance (time, place, manner)’ to form
interrogative words (76-78). Notice that entire phrases (76d, 78d), referring to the focus of
the question, can be situated between the pro-form and the interrogative clitic.

"AntipassiveAntipassive is a phenomenon typical of ergative languages, corresponding
functionally to a ‘mirror image’ of the passive construction in nominative-accusative
languages (Silverstein 1976). In a syntactically ergative language, “while the A and the O in
an ergative clause are marked as ergative and absolutive respectively, the A in an antipassive
is typically coded as an absolutive NP, and the O (if present) appears in a case other than the
absolutive” (Cooreman 1994, 50).39 Although some authors, such as Cooreman, limit the
discussion of antipassive constructions to ergative languages, nominative-accusative
39I will follow Cooreman in adopting Dixon’s (1979) use of the labels A and O to refer to the two participants in
a two-participant clause—prototypically, the agent and the patient, respectively.
195languages may also present backgrounding antipassives, which “function to demote the
undergoer to peripheral status” (Foley and Van Valin 1985: 338). This is what occurs in
Karajá, where antipassive, marked by the prefix O-, results in the deletion of an unknown or
irrelevant direct object:(33)nadIrOTUhOrErI

ha)bu ∅-r-O-Î-ukaèr-ErI
man3-CTFG-ANTI-3/REL-split=CTFG-PROGR
‘The man is splitting (something).’As these examples show, antipassive in Karajá is not promotional (or foregrounding),
in the sense that the A remains in the same syntactic relation it occupies in the corresponding
active, transitive voice. Furthermore, the antipassive construction in Karajá does not allow
the expression of the demoted O whatsoever, which is an interesting parallel to what occurs
with the agent in the passive construction.
Antipassives in Karajá are used to suppress an irrelevant, unknown, or undetermined
object. Common examples involve typical activities such as ‘to clear (a garden)’:(35)idZoi wobaèdI∅-r-O-laSiurEèkre
guys ax=INSTR
3-CTFG-ANTI-clear=FUT
‘The guys will clear [the garden] with axes.’
At least one intransitive stem, -ObrO, seems to have resulted from reanalysis of aformerly transitive stem including the antipassive marker, as suggested by the existence of an
allomorph without the initial vowel (brO; cf. also the nominal form, a-l-ObrO-da ‘plant’). As196the example below shows, -ObrO ‘to plant’ is an intransitive, intrinsically antipassive verb,
which needs to be transitivized in order for it to occur with objects:40(36)warikOrEwadEkErIkOrOm´)Îawa-rikOrE

Although the antipassive was not described by previous authors, it is commonly
found in both narrative and descriptive texts, commonly being used in contexts such as the
one above, in which an antipassive form of the verb is later followed by a transitive one,
specifying the object. Another example, from a traditional tale, is provided below. The
sentences are part of a passage in which two young men, returning to their village, hear
someone pounding something with a mortar. At first, the verb TÈ is given in an antipassive

expressed by free pronouns (dIkar´) ‘I’, kai ‘you’, Î´kI ‘he, she, it’).","[206, 207, 208, 209]"

In most languages where there are distinctions such as the ones between i-class stems
and Î-class stems, postpositions are also divided between both classes. That may also have
been the case in Karajá. Notice that all suppletive third-person forms begin with /Î/,
suggesting that such ‘pronouns’ are relics of Î-class postpositional paradigms. Notice also
that, if this theory is correct, a second-person form corresponding to ÎU would have been
*∅-U; that may be the origin of the second-person prefix U- mentioned above.
Karajá does not seem to have adverbs as an independent part-of-speech, adverbial
functions being performed by postpositional phrases. Consequently, corresponding to
adverbial clauses, Karajá presents nominalized clauses occurring as objects of postpositions.
Example (72) below illustrates the use of the comitative postposition èwada) to form
conditional clauses (example from the Xambioá dialect). Given the importance of
postpositions in forming adverbial subordinate clauses, their semantics will be further
described in Chapter 5.","[72, 73]"

(either because of their highly polysemic nature, or because of the semantic subtleties that
differentiate them). A brief explanation of the meanings most commonly associated with
some of them shall be helpful in understanding their use with subordinate clauses.
The evitative postposition indicates what is to be avoided or feared, marking the
oblique complements of verbs such as -UbErU ‘to be freightened’ (4) and wO ‘to hide’.3 An
example of the temporal postposition (‘when’) is given in (5) below. Besides indicating
source (‘from’), the ablative postposition marks objects of comparison (6).","[235, 236]"

‘The turtle split the jaguar’s forehead.’In the passive construction, the original O becomes the subject, as in languages such
as English, for example. However, unlike English, where the agent in a passive construction
can be expressed as an oblique (‘by-phrase’), in Karajá the agent, although sometimes
implicit, cannot be expressed at all. Thus, passives in Karajá are both a backgrounding
construction, functioning to delete unknown or irrelevant subjects, and a foregrounding
construction, since it results in the promotion of the original O to subject position (Foley and
Van Valin 1985).",[64]
"237A similar state of affairs may very well have been the diachronic source of the
‘subordinating accent’ in Karajá. The shift could have been originally triggered by a
subordinating morpheme of some sort,12 which would have later disappeared, leaving stress
shift as evidence of its diachronic existence.
Another possible origin would be a more general, delimiting use of stress (common in
languages where stress is predictable), to mark the boundaries of the noun phrase. However,
given the lack of comparative evidence, one can only speculate on the origins of such
phenomenon.133.4 Previous descriptionsIn spite of its extreme pervasiveness, the phenomenon of the ‘subordinating accent’
was not mentioned in previous accounts of Karajá grammar (Fortune & Fortune 1964,
Fortune 1970, Fortune 1973, Maia 1998). In his typological study, Maia states that he was
able to find “hypothetical relative constructions” only through direct elicitation, “similar
structures not being detected in the texts analyzed” (Maia 1998:33).14 The “hypothetical”
here relates to the fact that he could not identify any relative pronoun (or any subordinating
morpheme, for that matter) in the constructions considered. Notwithstanding this, the
examples of “hypothetical relative constructions” that he provides (reproduced below with
12This ‘subordinating’ morpheme could have been a nominal clitic, such as an article (which would thus pair
with the indefinite article ♀ èdo)).
13
Sinchronically, one could postulate the existence of a ‘zero clitic’ to account for the stress shift. Since this
more abstract analysis does not necessarily present any analytical advantage, I will adopt a more concrete
analysis in this paper, indicating the stress shift whenever necessary.
14
Although Maia’s statement seems to suggest that relative clauses are less common in texts than in elicited
materials, that is certainly not the case. Most examples in this paper were indeed taken from texts, where
subordination is extremely common. In fact, all the subordinate clause types here described are highly favored
constructions in Karajá grammar.
238my own transcription and morphological segmentation) very likely presented the stress shift
illustrated above. Since Maia relies on the rather inaccurate orthography used in Karajá
schools, the stress shift went unnoticed in his analysis.15Maia’s examples of “hypothetical relative constructions” reanalized

Although stress shift as a subordinating device is not mentioned in the work of the
SIL missionaries, it is indicated in their translation of the New Testament by the use of an
accent on the aspectual clitic (as mentioned in Chapter 1). This procedure, however, is not
adopted in the common orthography taught at the Karajá schools.","[248, 249, 250]"

Therefore, this process occurs only with a closed set of words, all of them containing

such as the indefinite article èdo), which are intrinsically unstressed.
140in the male speech, becoming ♂ ao)da) [ao)""na], probably due to analogy with its native
homonym, ado)da) ‘thing’.113.3. Lexical differencesIn some cases, the forms occurring in the male and female speech may be totally
different words. That is the case of the vocative interjections (♀ wu, ♂ kÈ) and of the
interjections expressing surprise or admiration (♀ bi, ♂ bEbE). Examples such as these-involving interjections and other “emotive words”--are rather common in other languages.
Fortune and Fortune (1975: 115-6) also mention two other cases in which “the men’s speech
form is totally different from the women’s”—the verbs ‘to cry’ and (in my translation) ‘to
become angry’. This is clearly a mistake. The roots obu and hi ‘to cry’ and TIra and EbUrE
‘to become angry’ are used in both female and male speech to refer to processes happening to
female and male subjects, respectively—a difference having no relation with the female
versus male speech distinctions with which this chapter is concerned.12 Similar examples are
found in Yana, according to Sapir’s (1949) description:11In Javaé, as we will see, only the male forms of the words containing the morphemes ado) and do) were
preserved: ao)da ‘thing’, hirarièo) ‘a girl’ etc. However, the loanword for ‘pineapple’ in Javaé maintains the
original [n] in both male and female speech: ado)da). This example suggests that the drift towards male speech
(if there was indeed one; see Section 6) was already consolidated by the time this loanword entered the
language (cf. section 4).
12
Similar mistakes were made by Ehrenreich (1894), in a time when knowledge of Portuguese among the
Karajá was probably very rare, making communication between outsiders and the Karajá a challenging
endeavor. He listed as male-female speech variants words that actually have different meanings, and are
common to both varieties. That is the case of the words watSiwi ‘cooking pot’ and b´TE ‘plate’, listed by
Ehrenreich as the male- and female-speech forms for ‘pot’, respectively (Ehrenreich 1894:23).
141(…) there is a small number of verb stems which apply exclusively to activity
carried on by a male or by a female; e.g., ni-, ni@- “a male goes” but ‘a- “a
female goes,” bu-ri-, bu-ri@- “a man dances” but dja-ri, dja-ri@-, “a woman
dances.” In the latter case the difference of verb probably reflects an actual
difference in the style of dancing. [1949:206]
Following Sapir, I shall suggest that, for ‘to cry’ and ‘to get angry’, the differences between
the verbs in Karajá would probably also reflect actual differences in the processes of crying
and getting angry. Notice that the verb obu ‘(a woman) to cry’ is also used to refer to the
sounds made by birds and to the ritual wailing of deceased relatives, performed exclusively
by women.
Fortune & Fortune (1963, 16) also include in the same category of ‘totally different’
words the verb ♀ ohokudZa ‘to listen’ (♂ ohola). However, in spite of the somewhat striking
surface differences between the form used in female speech and the one used in male speech,
the latter can be regularly derived from the former by the processes described above: kdropping and vowel deletion. The differences between the consonants occurring in the last
syllable of both forms, dZ versus l, can also be explained as the result of a regular
phonological process. As seen in Chapter 2, the lateral \l\ becomes palatalized when
contiguous to the [high, +ATR] vowels /i/, /È5/, and /u/. In the aforementioned example,
palatalization does not occur in the male form because the vowel /u/, which would trigger it,
is not present. A similar example is ♀ b´dokudZ´kE ‘pirarucu fish’, ♂ b´dOl´kE ~ b´dOlEE.","[151, 152, 153]"

‘As soon as he gets there, they will come for us.’22Haspelmath (1995:3) defines converb as “a nonfinite verb form whose main function
is to mark adverbial subordination” [his emphasis] “Another way of putting it”, he adds, “is
that converbs are verbal adverbs, just like participles are verbal adjectives.”23 At first, from a22This is one of the few examples of a third-person centripetal verb in the realis that does not occur with the
prefix k´-. Possible semantic motivations for the absence of the prefix are being investigated.

Similar constructions have been called ‘absolutive clauses’ by some authors. According to Thompson &
Longacre (1985:200-203), absolutive “is a cover term for a subordinate clause type in which the following
conditions hold: (i) the clause is marked in some way as being subordinate; (ii) there is no explicit signal of the
248grammatical point of view, there seems to be no reason to distinguish converbs from the
other postpositional phrases described in the preceding sections. However, there is a crucial
difference between them: while the clauses discussed earlier are commonly marked for tense,
converbs generally are not. Since typical finite clauses in Karajá are characterized by the
presence of a tense-aspect marker, a distinguishing feature of converbs (as opposed to the
other postpositional clauses) is their nonfiniteness (which, according to Haspelmath, is a
definitional characteristic of converbs).
In the majority of the examples, the converb has the same subject as the main clause,
but that is not necessarily the case. As examples (72) and (73) show, converbs with different
subjects are also possible.","[258, 259, 260]"
"5. Descriptive wordsA number of Macro-Jê languages—including Karajá--are traditionally described as
presenting an active-stative verb agreement system to some degree. According to Fortune &
Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs are divided into two different classes, active
and stative, with the latter consisting essentially of predicates which denote adjectival
meanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ These predicates take a series of person markers
which partially coincides with the pronominal object markers in transitive verbs, and which
happens to be the same series of possessive prefixes occurring with nouns. A more careful
examination, however, demonstrates that such ‘verbs’ are, in fact, nouns, and that transitivity,
rather than stativity, plays a central role in Karajá grammar.
The case of Karajá (as well as a brief observation of other languages of the stock)
suggests that one must be cautious in analyzing descriptive predicates as verbs in Macro-Jê212languages. In cases in which there are clear criteria to distinguish nouns and verbs,
descriptive predicates tend to behave mostly like nouns. For example, in Karajá a verb must
first be nominalized in order to appear in a descriptive predicate. Consequently, one must
also be cautious in relying on the behavior of descriptive predicates as a sole criterion to
propose active-stative systems.
Predicative and attributive adjectives are among the lesser known aspects of Macro-Jê
languages. According to the descriptions available, in all Macro-Jê languages the ‘adjective’
would follow the noun (Rodrigues 1999: 193). Since most Macro-Jê languages are SOV, the
position of the adjective in these languages would constitute a systematic counter-example to
Greenberg’s implicational universals, according to which adjectives would tend to precede
the modified noun in SOV languages (Greenberg 1966). However, since most such
descriptions do not give clear evidence for the existence of adjectives as an independent part
of speech, the apparently exceptional nature of adjectives in Macro-Jê may well be just
another undesirable result of what one might call ‘translation-based linguistic analysis.’
That is certainly the case of Karajá, also traditionally described as having postposed
adjectives (Maia 1998: 32). However, a careful analysis of the Karajá data clearly
demonstrates that words denoting adjectival meanings in this language are abstract nouns
whose behavior is identical to that of obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding to
attributive constructions such as the angry man, Karajá presents a genitive construction, the
man’s anger. This implies that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” word
would be, in fact, the head of the noun phrase, a phenomenon documented in languages such
as Aleut (Sadock 2000), but commonly overlooked when considering Lowland South
American languages.","[223, 224]"
"4. Female versus male speech in JavaéIn this section, I will describe the female versus male speech distinctions occurring in
Javaé as in comparison with the other three dialects. According to Fortune & Fortune
(1963), such differences would not occur in Javaé, as both males and females would speak
what corresponds to the male speech in the remaining dialects. In fact, that is the opinion of
most of the speakers of the Karajá and Xambioá dialects, for whom “Javaé women speak like
men.” As I intend to show in this section, although such an affirmation may be sensible from
the perspective of the Karajá and Xambioá speakers, it is not completely accurate.
In fact, Javaé preserves the distinctions between female and male speech in a number
of words. For example, while a Javaé woman says ha)lOkOE ‘jaguar’, a man says ha)lOE.
However, most of the words for which the distinctions are maintained are those for which the
deletion of the velar stop /k/ in the male speech is optional (‘Class b’ words). For the great
majority of the words for which the k-dropping is obligatory in the other dialects, Javaé
women adopted the corresponding male form: dZia)r´) ‘I’, bero ‘river’, riOrE ‘offspring’. That
is why, from the viewpoint of Karajá and Xambioá speakers, there is nothing exclusively
‘feminine’ in the speech of the Javaé women. The text fragment below, from a story told by
a Javaé woman from the village of Boto Velho, illustrates this point. Notice that ao) ‘thing’,155dIar´) ‘I’, a- ‘first person irrealis prefix’, and ko ‘to’ are exclusively male forms in the other
three dialects. The only morpheme corresponding to a female form in the other dialects islÈkÈ ‘to tell’, for which the k-dropping rule is optional:(20)ao)madIar´) ararÈbekere,in´)wEbOhOnarIkI,ao)-ba)dIar´) a-r-a-rÈbEèkere,id´)-wE-bOhO-da)èrIkI,thing-PHATI1-CTFG-INTR-speak=FUTpeople-belly-break-NOMèNARRin´)rIkIÎairawebohore.id´)èrIkI

Javaé involve Class b words, such as ÎIkI ‘he, she, it’. For the majority of Class c words,
however, the Javaé women adopted male forms. This is true for most of the words that
present vowel fusion in the male form of the other dialects, such as roSi ‘to eat’, bero ‘river’,
and Îa ‘to take off’. The few exceptions include ♀ ha)lOkOE (♂ ha)lOE) ‘jaguar’ and ♀ ikOrO
(♂ idZOrO) ‘fox’, which can be seen as relics from a time when the distinctions between male
and female speech in Javaé were still strongly observed.","[166, 167]"
"2.2.3 Pragmatic restrictions and evidentiality: the speaker as an observerDespite the pervasiveness of directional marking in Karajá, a preliminary study
(Ribeiro 2002) revealed what seemed to be a striking gap in the directional paradigm: the
occurrence of centripetal markers with progressive verbs seemed to be rather limited. 3636Another unexplained gap remains to be further investigated: the absence of centripetal marking with
perfective verbs, marked by the auxiliary èr-a. In addition, as I mentioned above, non-verbal predicates
(‘descriptives,’ postpositional phrases, etc.) do not occur with the centripetal marker, although they take the
187As it turns out, this apparent exception is due to somewhat unusual pragmatic constraints,
rather than to a morphological idiosyncrasy. Although a few occurrences of 3rd person verbs
in the centripetal direction could be found in the text corpus (19), there are no examples of
centripetal progressive verbs in the 1st or 2nd persons. The example below is from a
traditional Karajá story:

As it turns out, unlike its counterparts with imperfective, future, or potential verbs, a

information, implying that the narrated event is being witnessed by the speaker (or by
whomever is assigned the role of deictic center; see (19) above): da)rÈbEèd

In the passive construction, the original O becomes the subject, as happens in
languages such as English, for example. However, unlike English, where the agent in a
passive construction can be expressed as an oblique (‘by-phrase’), in Karajá the agent,
although sometimes implicit, cannot be expressed at all. Thus, passives in Karajá are both a
backgrounding construction, functioning to delete unknown or irrelevant subjects, and a
foregrounding construction, since they result in the promotion of the original O to subject
position (Foley and Van Valin 1985).","[205, 206]"
"265Besides the scarcity of data on some of its now-extinct members, such as the
languages belonging to the Purí and Kamakã families, Macro-Jê comparative studies run into
problems that typically plague long-range comparativists: roots are generally isolating and
monosyllabic, and syllabic patterns are rather simple. Since most likely cognates tend to be
of the CV type, there is a greater risk of accidental similarities. That risk is particularly
increased by an apparent neglect to abide by the comparative method when proposing
cognates. A case in point is the work of Aryon Rodrigues, a major Brazilian scholar, on
comparative Macro-Jê linguistics. Besides adding little to the cognate sets already identified
by previous authors (Guérios, Loukotka), Rodrigues’ cognate inventories (Rodrigues 1999,
Rodrigues & Cabral 2007) illustrate primary methodological mistakes, including an obvious
case of borrowing (the word for ‘maize’, which is likely of Arawák origin; cf. Ribeiro 2010)
and assigning cognate words to wrong cognate sets--for instance, Kaingáng krE) ‘egg’ is
considered a cognate of the word for ‘egg’ in other Jê languages, which trace back to ProtoJê *NrE, even though (as Davis had already demonstrated) Kaingáng preserved Proto-Jê *N as
/N/; Kaingáng krE) traces back to Proto-Jê kra ‘offspring’ instead. As examples such as this
illustrate, little attention is given to phonological regularity, even in the case of a fairly wellestablished family as Jê. Rodrigues’ main contribution to comparative Macro-Jê studies was
the detection of shared morphological similarities which are likely due to common
inheritance (Rodrigues 1992, 2000b; Ribeiro 2011). Particularly relevant for Karajá are the
so-called “relational prefixes”, linking morphemes discussed in Section 3.2 below (cf.
Chapter 4 as well).
While Macro-Jê comparative linguistics has been marked by an overall lack of
methodological soundness, resulting in questionable proposals of genetic relationship (as266illustrated by the inclusion of Guató), it has attracted, on the other hand, unfounded
pessimism. A case in point is Dixon & Aikhenvald’s (1999:18) claim that the similarities
among the several families within Macro-Jê would be due to areal, rather than genetic,
factors:“Rather than all the Macro-Je families being related in a higher-level tree, it seems to
us that they could constitute a long-term linguistic area; this would account for their
considerable typological similarities. (There may, of course, be genetic links between
some of the established families, within the linguistic area.)”
Such suggestion reveals a lack of familiarity with the evidence put forth by authors such as
Guérios, Loukotka, Davis, Gudschinsky, Boswood, and Rodrigues—mostly items of basic
vocabulary, such as body-part terms, and grammatical morphemes. Although not as robust
as one would wish (due in part to the temporal depth involved), such evidence points to
genetic, rather than areal, relationship.29 Furthermore, the typological similarities alluded to
by Dixon & Aikhenvald are common in lowland South America, and thus do not set MacroJê languages apart as a group.
Macro-Jê is, to a certain extent, reminiscent of North America’s Algic, in the sense
that, in both cases, there is a close-knit, well-established family (Algoquian; Jê, in our case)
and a number of distantly-related families or isolates (Wiyot and Yurok; Karajá, Ofayé, and
several others, in our case). A major difference is that there is even more internal diversity in
Macro-Jê, suggesting that it is even older than Algic. If, as Goddard (1991:64) states,
“Algonquian, Wiyot, and Yurok form a genetic grouping that is at, or very close to, the
maximum depth at which it is possible to reconstruct features of the protolanguage that retain
any appreciable degree of resolution,” Macro-Jê may provide an even fuzzier picture. For
29Similar objections against Dixon & Aikhenvald’s claims are raised by Voort (2004:213).
267most of the stock, however, regular phonological and grammatical correspondences are still
being uncovered, but one has to keep in mind the limitations mentioned by Goddard (op. cit.)
for Algic:
“[…] it is methodologically instructive to note that this is a case in which the
comparative method produces a proof of genetic relationship without there being a
reconstructed phonology or phonological history beyond what is implied by a handful
of equations of identity, or near identity.”","[276, 277, 278, 279]"

‘I will wash it.’According to Fortune & Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs would be
divided into two different classes, active and stative, with the latter consisting essentially of
predicates denoting adjectival meanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ Descriptive
predicates take exactly the same series of person markers taken by nouns (Table 11), as
shown by the examples below:(47)a.c.wa-d-EbUrEèr-eb.

Centrifugal direction (‘thither’), marked by the prefix r- or by its zero-allomorph, indicates
that the process is seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (50a).
Centripetal direction (‘hither’), marked by the prefix d-, indicates that the process is seen as
occurring towards the current location of the speaker (50b). Centrifugal direction is the
unmarked member of the opposition. All verbs are marked for direction, including those that
apparently do not indicate a motion whatsoever, such as UrU ‘to die’. Notice that the clitic
aspectual auxiliaries also inflect for direction, and, in the 2nd person, also for person (32).","[58, 59]"
"5.5 Postpositions as discourse connectorsReflecting their use with adverbial clauses, third-person forms of adpositions are used

(93a) or attributes (93b). Notice that constructions such as Î´kÈ TUrO can be translated as
‘washed clothes’ or ‘the clothes’ washing’, being structurally identical to genitive phrases.
Notice that the location of the relative clause mirrors the location of the modifier in simple
attributive constructions.","[269, 270]"
"5.1 ‘Semantic types’As the examples above illustrate, concepts expressed as adjectives in other languages
can be lexicalized either as nouns or as change-of-state verbs in Karajá. The assignment of a
given concept to one or another part of speech seems to be semantically fairly consistent.
Opposite pairs (‘antonyms’) generally fall into the same part of speech, what is probably
related to the fact pointed out by Dixon (1977, 27) that “each semantic type has basic or
‘norm’ connection with a single part of speech.” Thus, while ÎOÎ´kE ‘to become hot’ anduÎǨÎǨ ‘to become cold’ are both verbs, -UrU ‘darkness’ and -uSa ‘clearness’ are both nouns.
Similarly, all basic-color concepts are basically lexicalized as verbs (TO ‘to be made red’,218kura ‘to be made white’, l´bÈ ‘to be made black’). The distribution of the different semantic
types between nouns and verbs constitutes an interesting question to be investigated in the
future.","[229, 230]"

stand up’. As the example below illustrate, the result is a stative meaning (75a), as opposed
to a processual meaning (75b):(75)a.ÎÈÈ

converb subordination, there seems to be arguments to consider them as slightly more
grammaticalized than the converb constructions illustrated above. Since both the subordinate
and the main verbs share the same subject, they tend to form a contiguous, uninterrupted
250construction. In addition, there is at least one clear case in which an auxiliary-like
construction underwent further grammaticalization, resulting in a aspectual marker, as
described in the following section.","[260, 261, 262]"

‘You (plural) will bring it.’2.2.2 Empathy and discourse strategiesThis section briefly analyzes the use of directional inflection in narrative texts, as well
as in everyday verbal interactions. As mentioned above, the hypothesis suggested by the data
is that, besides its ‘literal,’ strictly directional use, directional inflection may be used to signal
empathy relationships between participants of the speech act and, in a narrative text, between
characters and narrator. The rationale that underlies this hypothesis is straightforward. In
any deictic system, the speaker is canonically the deictic center. Directionals can then be180used to establish relations of (physical, emotional, ideological, etc.) approximation or
distancing from such a deictic center.
The use of directional inflection to signal empathy relationships between participants
of the speech act is particularly clear with non-motion verbs, for which both centrifugal and
centripetal marking options are available without great semantic constraints. In such cases,
the use of a centripetal marker seems to imply that the speaker is somewhat more involved
with the process described by the verb. That is why centripetal marking seems to be
preferred in situations where advice is being given, such as in the constructions (12) and (13)
below, marked by the admonitory particle èhEd´). On the other hand, the use of centrifugal
marking in such constructions would fail to convey the concern of the speaker with the fate
of the addressee.","[190, 191, 192]"
"8.3 MorphosyntaxKarajá is an SOV, head-marking language. Core NP arguments—that is, subject and
direct object—are not morphologically marked. Pronominal subjects are expressed by a
series of free pronouns, such as ♀ dIkar´) ‘I’ in (28) below, while pronominal objects are37expressed by a series of bound morphemes, such as wa- ‘1st person’ in (29). In contrast to a
fairly simple nominal morphology, Karajá presents a complex verb morphology, being
traditionally described as having a very irregular fused set of prefixes indicating person,
aspect, object, and direction (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Wiesemann 1986, Maia 1998).
However, a more careful analysis reveals a rather regular, mostly agglutinating morphology,
with separate prefixes indicating person (and cumulatively, mood), direction, and valence
(28). In addition, pronominal direct objects are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29).","[48, 49]"

terms ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ to refer to the high vowels /u/ and /U/, respectively. The terms
were translated by the Karajá teachers as ikutSiE ‘heavy’ and iwEÎari ‘light’, which provide a
rather useful (albeit impressionistic) description of the oppositions between [+ATR] and [ATR] vowels in Karajá.34 The adoption of such native metalinguistic terminology by the
Karajá has facilitated the discussion of [ATR] distinctions in the language, as native
speakers’ intuitions (and my non-native impressions) on whether a vowel is heavy or light
tend to match its (morpho)phonemic behavior concerning vowel harmony and palatalization.","[126, 127]"

has instrumental (he went by train), locative (he is by the fountain), and temporal (I’ll be back by midnight)
uses, among others. The criteria to determine the ‘basic’ meaning of postpositions may be fairly arbitrary. In
labeling the Karajá pospositions, I took into consideration what seems to be their more general, productive, and
non-idiomatic uses (as far as possible).

Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).
According to Blake (1994: 156), evitative (also called ‘aversive’) case markers are also common in Australian
languages.

Talmy (1985:129), who defines figure as “the salient moving or stationary object in a motion event” and path as
a category which “refers to the variety of paths followed, or sites occupied, by the Figure object.”

Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),
226name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,
asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15). As we will see, this semantic
diversity accounts for the use of this postposition to mark both purpose clauses and converbs,
as well as sentential complements of verbs such as say, tell, etc.6(11)♂a-r-∅-aèkre

for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.
6
This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.
227In addition to the paradigmatic peculiarities and wide range of semantic uses, the
‘diffuse locative’ postposition, èb´), presents some distributional peculiarities. As illustrated
by (16) below, in which èb´) occurs as a purpose marker, it can follow other postpositions (in
this case, the ‘static locative’ èkI). [The example also illustrates the use of the dative
postposition, èd´kE ~ èdEE, with benefactive functions.](16)wa-dEE

"6.3 Interactions between vowel harmony and palatalizationAs we have seen, palatalization is clearly a lexical process in Karajá, whereas vowel
harmony is likely a post-lexical one, occuring across word-boundaries; vowel harmony and
palatalization would be, in traditional terms, in counter-feeding order. There are, however, at
least two cases in which vowel harmony clearly feeds palatalization. These can be seen as
old compounds, which are not synchronically perceived as such. One is the kinship terma)dZikura ‘mother’s older sister’, which results probably from the combination of the
morphemes a)dI ‘mother’ and kura ‘white’41 (compare it with waha ‘my father’ versuswahakura ‘my father’s older brother’). In this case, the high [+ATR] vowel /u/ triggers
vowel harmony in the [-ATR] vowel of the preceding root, which then triggers palatalization
on the voiced stop /d/, as shown by the derivation given below:(96)41input

[adZiku'ra]For a discussion of the use of color terms in Karajá kinship terminology, see Donahue (1982:158).
123Another example in which vowel harmony seems to have fed palatalization is the
particle tSibo ‘approximately’, which is probably the combination of the pro-form ÎI and the
interrogative particle èbo (ÎIbo [""Îibo] ‘how?’ > tSibo):42(97)input

repetition. The entire verb root is reduplicated (98). Again, a bimoraic minimality constraint
is at play: when the root is monosyllabic, reduplication includes all the verb prefixes:(98)(99)a.b-∅-I-krOèkre

analyses of the language, the analysis presented here proposes a larger vowel inventory; a
major contribution of the present analysis lies in demonstrating the relevance of the feature
[ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony. The
reanalysis of the vocalic inventory has substantial consequences for the analysis of the
consonantal inventory as well: palatal consonants, considered as independent phonemes in
previous analysis, are the result of a process of palatalization around [high, +ATR] vowels.
Although the distribution of palatal consonants is fairly predictable from a morphologicallyinformed point of view, a process of phonogenesis seems to be taking place: in addition to
the adoption of loanwords which violate native phonotactic constraints, there are even
minimal pairs (cf. idZ´d´) ‘feces’ vs i-r´d´) ‘his feces’), albeit morphologically conditioned.
Such factors result in a fluid situation in which palatal consonants may end up acquiring
phonological status.","[134, 135, 136]"
"7. DataThe data on which this dissertation is based were collected by me from male and
female native speakers of all four dialects, mostly during field trips conducted between 1996
and 2003. The bulk of the materials consists of texts of different genres, including traditional
narratives and historical and personal accounts. In an effort to document traditional
manufacturing techniques (particularly endangered among the Xambioá), I have also
recorded texts of a more descriptive nature, explaining how to extract nut oils, how to spin22and weave, etc.7 For comparative purposes, I collected standardized lexical lists, in addition
to morphological paradigms and sentences. The data were transcribed and elicited with the
assistance of native speakers—in particular, Ijeseberi Karajá (Southern Karajá), Sinvaldo
Wahùka (Northern Karajá and Javaé), and Luiz Kurikala (Northern Karajá and Xambioá).
Their particular sets of life experiences were extremely useful for the task of transcribing and
analyzing the texts. The late Ijeseberi, possessor of an amazing, intuitive perceptiveness to
linguistic detail, had already experience working with the SIL missionaries and with Marcus
Maia; a “modern” young man, Ijeseberi was however deeply rooted in his native culture,
helping me document and analyze traditional songs and explaining in detail the collected
myths. Sinvaldo Wahùka, the son of a Javaé couple raised in a Northern Karajá village, is a
Karajá-language teacher, a poet in his native language, and is very aware of the shortcomings
of the official orthography, which we often discussed. Finally, Luiz Kurikala, a Northern
Karajá teacher currently living among the Xambioá, is very familiar with both dialects and
very keen to the small details that differentiate them. In general, I listened to the recordings
side by side with them, making sure to note phonological details which are not captured by
the current orthography. My knowledge of Karajá has also greatly benefitted from my
participation, as a consultant, in several training programs for indigenous teachers
(discussing, among other things, the orthography and assisting in the production of
indigenous literacy materials). Thanks to their interest and generosity, every interaction with
Karajá speakers has been a unique learning opportunity.","[33, 34]"
