[22:32]2.1.5. Negative forms
Besides the positive verb forms described above, there are negative forms. Verbal
negation can be expressed by the following means:
(1) combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb;
(2) combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative (a-...ka);
(3) combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from
the deverbal predicative;
(4) the analytical form, derived from the negative analytical representation
(nuN-...-a/-ta);
(5) circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in (the latter is identical to the
caritive adjective (see 2.2.2) marker. It is compatible with the negative particle).
Now we will consider the negative forms in detail.
Type (1) is found only for the desirable moods — optative and conjunctive. In
this case the negative (more precisely, the prohibitive) particle qytymmy 91 is used.(i)tovitgag-awwav-laNvyly-NNy...andat.onceRES-leave-RES+3pl.Sgo.out.on.the.shore-ANLTAnd at once they went out on the shore... [22:28]
It is interesting to note that the negative particle qytymmy is also compatible with nouns,
cf. gymmy wiwnyN ty-t-awwavy-N, qytymmy korfa-N ‘I will arrive at Vyvenka rather than in
Korf’. However in general nouns are more often combined with the negative noun alval@in ‘not
that, another’ rather than with qytymmy, cf. gymnan ty-gita-tky-n qajunJunJu, alval@in
NavysqatpilJ ‘I look at the boy rather than at the girl.’

"Type (2) has two realizations. In combination with the negative particle ally, it
contrasts with the positive forms of the real moods. In combination with the particle

deriving the negative correlate of the supine (verbal nominal) (see 2.1.6.2 below). The
prefix part of the circumfix coincides with the root of the verb ‘be lost’ (i.e. not to
exist in the real world), the suffix part coincides with the marker of verbal analytical
representation (see the preceding type). This negative form refers to a situation whose
non-existence is a goal of the action expressed by the main clause (see 2.1.6.2).
Second, a-…-kyl@in circumfix is used for the derivation of the negative form,
and then the negative particle ally is added. In contrast to other forms this type is a
deverbal attributive. There are grounds to interpret this form as a negative correlate of
the deverbal adjective (n-...-qin); see 2.1.2.

2.1.6. Infinite forms
The following are the infinite forms: i n f i n i t i v e , s u p i n e , c o n v e r b s , and
participles.
2.1.6.1. The infinitive is derived from the verb stem by means of the -k/-ki marker
(identical to the locative marker), the allomorph -ki usually being used after stems
with final -N, cf. alu-k ‘pick berries’, tannuN-ki ‘fish’. In accordance with phonetic
rules (see 1.3.4.3), the allomorph -k can be realized as -kki after the stressed syllable,
cf. gyvô-kki ‘get stuck’. Most frequently the infinitive is used in the context of phasal
verbs, however other contexts are also possible (see details below in 2.1.7.5).
2.1.6.2. The supine is derived from the verb stem by means of the marker -nvyN. It is
used in the context of motion verbs as well as of other verbs where the expression of
goal is necessary (see (18a-c)). If the goal of the main action is prevention rather than
accomplishment of an action, the negative correlate of the supine is used (tymNi-...-a/ta) (see 18d).

affixes similar to the spatial cases. Converbs do not have any inflectional categories.","[66, 67]"
"61auxiliary depends on the (in)transitivity of the lexical verb: intransitive verbs are
combined with the auxiliary ‘be’ and transitive verbs with the auxiliary ‘do, have’.
The analytical forms have positive as well as negative polarity. The lexical verb
inside p o s i t i v e a n a l y t i c a l f o r m s has the suffix marker -a/-ta (identical to the
ergative marker). There is also the suffix marker -N, see (9b), identical to the dative
marker. These forms are almost impossible outside of analytical verb forms; therefore
their converbal (see below) interpretation is not desirable 88 . We will refer to them as
the analytical form of the lexical verb 89 (glossed as ANLT).
The following are examples with intransitive verb:

[33:31]
-a/-ta form, according translation, is used here as a converb, however in both cases the
subordinate as well as main verbs are the same: ‘eat’ and ‘wash down’. There is an assumption
that in this case the -a/-ta form is not a free one, but it is a part of idiomatic expression signifying
‘to eat and drink simultaneously’.

The imperative is formed by means of the circumfix ga-...-a/-ta 86 . Imperative
forms do not have the aspectual values, and lack regular personal markers 87 .
Nevertheless the imperative has restricted inflectional devices. First, it has number
agreement with a 1-2nd person argument identical to that of the polypersonal
conjugation (the marker -la, see 2.1.1.2.5). Second, it has 1sg P-argument agreement
by means of the inversion marker -ina, see 2.1.1.2.3. For example:

[37:5]In (29) both actions are repeated, however the first verb (‘run away’) has
perfective marking, and the second one (‘carry’) — imperfective marking. This is
because the first action is punctual and the second is prolonged.
In analytical negative forms relating to the temporal domain of the definite
future the auxiliary verb can have imperfective marking:

115109CHAPTER 3. Syntax
In this chapter we shall briefly, without any ambitions to completeness, consider
some of the most important topics of clause structure.
3.0. Basic notions
In this study of Alutor syntax we do not use such t r a d i t i o n a l syntactic notions as
subject and object since, in our opinion, their common usage is not congruent with
the internal structure of Alutor and would merely lead to misunderstanding. In this
case it is more advisable to use more neutral notions based on a framework of core
arguments constituting the base of clause syntactic structure (for the grounds of the
opposition “core vs. peripheral arguments” see [Kibrik 1998]).
There is a restricted number of core arguments in a clause. If there is only one
core argument in a clause 116 , the clause (as well as its predicate) is i n t r a n s i t i v e .
This argument is called the S - a r g u m e n t (Sole) irrespective of its semantic role. If
there are two core arguments in a clause, the clause (as well as its predicate) is
t r a n s i t i v e . A transitive clause has an agent-like A - a r g u m e n t (Agentive) and a
patient-like P- a r g u m e n t (Patientive).
In our case, this terminology is preferable because it does not ascribe a
particular syntactic pattern to Alutor clause structure, keeping this fundamental
question open for further investigation, as there is not yet enough data to resolve this
problem.
3.1. Transitivity increase and decrease
Alutor has a strict distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs. T r a n s i t i v e
verbs have two core arguments: an A-argument and a P-argument. The A-argument is
116In Alutor there are many ambient verbs with a zero S-argument indicating ‘environment
of the event’:

as shown in Table 14.

P o s s e s s i v e adjectives are usually derived from nominal stems by means of the
suffix -in(a) (further shortened to -in), which in the 3rd person appears as -in/-inat/-ina(-w(wi)) ‘3sg/du/pl’.
With 1st declension nouns (see 2.3.1.1) the suffix is placed immediately after a
nominal stem, for instance, qyliktumg-in ‘POSS+3sg’, qyliktumg-ina-t ‘POSS+3du’,
qyliktumg-ina ‘POSS+3pl’ − the possessive forms of the noun qyliktumgy-n ‘brother
(for a sister), NOM+SG’. The person-number agreement markers are placed
immediately after the possessive suffix; see the forms in Table 16.
TABLE 16. Person-number markers
102The vowel i of the morph -igym appears as a result of the coalescence of an epenthetic y
and j (see 1.3.6).","[88, 89, 90]"
"2.3.1.3. Local semantic functions
A noun phrase can also express different types of location (location with respect to
the object expressed by a base noun). These functions are expressed either by a
derivative suffix (in the case there is a contact between the objects or at least it is
implied) or by an adposition governing the locative noun phrase (in the case there is
no obvious contact between the objects), for details see [Muravyova 1994].
In order to express functions of the first type, a nominal derivative with a
locative suffix is used. In general, such derivatives have complete paradigms
including the nominative, but the most frequent forms are cases with locative
functions, such as the locative, the dative (with an allative function), the lative and the
prolative.
The following local functions are expressed by means of suffixes:
SUPER ‘surface of an object’, the marker -lq (with the variant -lJq), for
instance: Najy-lJqy-N ‘(climb) the mountain’ [8:38], gytgy-lq-epyN ‘(migrate) along
the surface of the lake’ [16:7], ujatiki-lJqy-k ‘(load smth.) on the sledge’ [22:66],
vylJusa-lJqy-k ‘(put smth.) on a dish’ [29:27];
IN ‘inner part of an object’, the marker -giN, for instance: ulJgyv-giN-ki ‘in the
grave’ [5:10], ulJgyv-giN-gypyN ‘(shout) from the grave’ [7:59], syge-giN-ki ‘(hide) in
the sands’ [18:18], tygar-giN-kyN ‘(go) inside the store-hole’ [21:73];
INTER ‘place among objects’, the marker -swyn/-lwyn, for instance: tumykkalwyny-k ‘(to talk about smth.) in the presence of other people’ [22:68], ra.mky-swyni ‘(to visit) all the houses’ [28:2], Ne-swyny-k ‘(to live) among the mountains’ [32:4];101APUD ‘place near an object’, the marker -teny, for instance: ra-teny-k ‘(to
dance) by the neighbouring house’ [39:4], inmy-teny-k ‘(to build a village) near the
cliff’ [23:3], ynykka-teny-k ‘(to put smth.) near himself’ [29:21].
If there is no obvious contact between the two objects, adpositions 108
expressing various local functions are used (they govern the locative case form), cf.
ymiNqal tynupy-k ‘behind a hill’, ujatiki-k gytulNyNqal ‘at the side of a sledge’,
rymetyNqal tynupy-k ‘far behind a hill’, inmy-k telyNqal ‘on the other side of a rock’,
tilirra-k semyk ‘near Tilirran {the village Tilichiki}’.
2.3.2. Predicative forms
The predicative form of a noun is marked for person and number of its S-actant. To
express the 1st and the 2nd person the person-number suffixes identical with those of
an adjective (original or deverbal) are added. The 3rd person is identical with the
nominative singular, dual and plural respectively. The person-number forms are given
in Table 19.

2-jgyt-turi-turu3= NOM+SG= NOM+DU=NOM+PLThe predicative is used when a noun is a predicate (for present situations).

marked differently:

latter is more common). We refer to them as adpositions and use this term in the Dictionary
(adpostions are marked with the abbreviation adp). Some Alutor adpositions consist of two parts:
the main part (the root) and the suffix with a local function, cf. tely.Nqal ‘on that side of’, with the
root {tely} ‘there, that’ and the suffix {-Nqal} meaning ‘the side of’.

Comment:The category m o o d is also obligatory. It has four values:
- i n d i c a t i v e (IND), does not have its own specific markers;
- o p t a t i v e (OPT), does not have its own specific markers 48 ;
- p o t e n t i a l (POT), circumfix marker ta-...(-N) 49 , framing the verb stem;
- c o n j u n c t i v e (CONJ), prefix marker @-/A- 50 .
Besides these, in Alutor there is also an impersonal form of the i m p e r a t i v e
(see 2.1.3).
Finally, the finite verb agrees 51 in person and number with its core arguments,
distinguishing three persons (1st/2nd/3rd person) and three numbers — s i n g u l a r
(sg), d u a l (du) and p l u r a l (pl) 52 . Intransitive verbs agree with their sole core
argument (S - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the nominative, and have, aspect and mood
being fixed, 9 person-number forms. The transitive verb agrees simultaneously with
the agentive argument (A - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the ergative as well as with the
patientive argument (P - a r g u m e n t 53 ) marked with the nominative, and has, aspect
48The mood value is coded cumulatively, together with person-number values, see below.
The suffix component of the circumfix can be covert, for example, in imperfective
potential. The potential marker coincides with desiderative marker (see 2.1.3 below).
50
The marker A- is a phonetic variant of the marker @- in specific positions (see 1.3.6).
51
In Alutor the person-number markers are combined with the unmarked usage of personal
pronouns in the core argument positions, so it is possible to interpret them as agreement markers.
52
As the paradigms show, semantically this tripartite personal opposition has its own
internal structure. The opposition ‘singular — non-singular’ (sg — nsg) consists of six deictic
items. Elementary single entities are defined in terms of speech act participants (1sg = ‘speaker’,
2sg = ‘hearer’) and non-participants of the speech act (3sg = ‘somebody’). Non-singular entities
are totalities of elementary entities: 1nsg = ‘speaker and hearer/somebody’, 2nsg = ‘hearer and
somebody’, 3nsg = ‘somebody and somebody’ (i.e. the countable number opposition of
homogenous entities is present only in the 3rd person). Exactly these entities are ordered in the
Deictic Hierarchy (see Figure 1 below). The arrangement of non-singular entities with respect to
singular entities is semantically motivated. Thus, ‘1nsg’ includes, besides the speaker, the hearer
and/or the 3rd person. Such an entity is lower on the Hierarchy than ‘1sg’. Simultaneously this
entity is higher than ‘2sg’, because it includes the speaker, and this factor is most important for
the Hierarchy. The motivation for ‘2nsg’ is similar.
Within the scope of the non-singular there is a proper number opposition of dual and plural
(du and pl), because the number of homogenous elementary entities increases, and this opposition
uses iconically specific coding devices (see 2.1.1.2.4). Dual does not have a surface expression (it
is possible to postulate the zero marker), and plural is expressed by a specific morpheme —
pluralizer -la.
In that way the prototypical number opposition is represented in the subsystem of 1/2nd
person nsg, and partially in 3rd person sg/nsg.

The conjugation of the intransitive verb ‘jump’ and the transitive verb ‘beat’ are
presented in Appendix. The linear structure of the finite verb form is presented in
Table 1. The nucleus of the form is its verb stem. It has the zero rank. Morpheme
slots that precede the stem (prefixes) have negative rank numbers increasing from
right to left. The slots following the stem (suffixes) have positive rank numbers
increasing from left to right.

wish I could attack her and subject her to an excruciating death. [20:54]In these contexts conjunctive has the following components of the meaning:
— the speaker wishes event P to be performed,
— the speaker has resources to accomplish event P,
— the speaker does not have a strong intention to use his resources for the
accomplishment of event P.
Forms in the 1pl actor conjunctive are translated as “If we could do P”:

"2.3. Nouns
The semantic and syntactic functions of a noun are expressed mostly by the items of
nominal grammatical categories (case-number marking and person-number marking –
see 2.3.1.1, 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.2), in some cases by derivative markers of location
(2.3.1.3) and adjectivization (2.3.3); some local functions are expressed outside a
locative noun by means of adpositions (2.3.1.3). Nouns are used either
a u t o n o m o u s l y or in i n c o r p o r a t i o n . Being used autonomously, a noun is
marked for a set of grammatical categories. Incorporated nouns are just bare stems,
without any category markers.
The set of grammatical categories a noun is inflected for depends on its
syntactic position in a sentence. Three types of noun forms are distinguished on the
morphological level: nominal, predicative and adjectival. The n o m i n a l form is
used in the position of an actant, the p r e d i c a t i v e form − in the position of a
predicate, the a d j e c t i v a l form − in the position of an attribute.
2.3.1. Nominal forms
2.3.1.1. Noun declension
The nominal form of a noun is inflected for case and number.
The category of c a s e is formed of the following 11 cases: n o m i n a t i v e
(NOM), e r g a t i v e (ERG), l o c a t i v e (LOC), d a t i v e (DAT), l a t i v e (LAT),
p r o l a t i v e (PROLAT), c o n t a c t i v e (CONT), c a u s a l (CAUS), e q u a t i v e
(EQUAT), c o m i t a t i v e (COMIT), a s s o c i a t i v e (ASSOC).
The category of n u m b e r has three values: s i n g u l a r (SG), d u a l (DU) and
p l u r a l (PL). The dual and plural forms of proper names express associative duality
and plurality, i.e. ‘X and somebody else’:
(68)pykir-lyqiv-la-tqutkinJnJaqu-tyk.approach-LQIV-PLUR-3pl.S+PFQutkinnaqu-DAT+NSGThey came back to the Qutkinnaqus {i.e. to the family of Qutkinnaqu}. [7:70]Case and number, in the forms where number is distinguished, are expressed by93fused items. Most of the items are suffixes, but the comitative and associative
markers are circumfixes. Besides these, some nouns form the nominative singular by
means of an operation − the final vowel truncation or the root reduplication.
Alutor nouns are divided into three groups with two sets of person-number
markers called d e c l e n s i o n s : the 1st declension and the 2nd declension.
The first group includes common nouns denoting non-humans. These nouns are
inflected using 1st declension items. 1st declension forms distinguish number
(singular, dual and plural) only in the nominative. In other cases (= oblique cases)
number is not distinguished, but is sometimes marked using verbal agreement or
defined by the context.
The second group includes proper names (human and those of domestic
animals) and kinship terms denoting elder relations. 2nd declension forms distinguish
number not only in the nominative, but also in some oblique cases; in the nominative
they distinguish singular, dual and plural, while in oblique cases they distinguish only
singular (SG) and non-singular (NSG)
The third group includes all other common nouns denoting humans. These
nouns are inflected using either 1st or 2nd declension forms (though the distribution
of these forms is not fully clear). For instance, the noun yllygy- ‘father’ has the
ergative yllyg-a (1st declension), which expresses either singular or plural, depending
on the context, and also the ergative yllygy-nak (2nd declension, singular) and yllygytyk (2nd declension, plural). The case-number forms are given in Table 18.","[93, 94]"

Potential means that the event P does not belong to the world of real events,
nevertheless P can potentially be in this world. This event does not have any
epistemic restrictions. It is quite natural that this type of event is closely related to
events that, in languages with the grammatical category of tense, pertain to future.
Therefore in most cases potential verb forms are translated as future forms:

Pp. 203–337CHAPTER 1. Phonology
CHAPTER 2. Morphology
CHAPTER 3. SyntaxCHAPTER 1. Phonology
In the present phonological sketch we will describe the following two main aspects of
Alutor phonology: the static aspect, that is inventories of units (segments and
suprasegmentals), and the dynamic aspect, that is phonological processes. The static
part deals with the sounds of Alutor − phones and phonemes (1.1), as well as the
syllable and rhythmic patterns (1.2). The dynamic part deals with the phonological
processes of Alutor, which are presented in the form of rewriting rules (1.3).
The approach we use here is similar to that of generative phonology (see also
[Kodzasov, Krivnova 1981]). Two levels of representing Alutor words are
distinguished: the underlying level, that is the level of phonemes (it corresponds to
the morphophonemic level in the Russian traditional phonology) and the surface
level, that is the level of phones, or systematic phonetic level (we omit some minor
details of Alutor pronunciation, irrelevant for the phonetic system). Rewriting rules
apply to the underlying representation of a word, which is a sequence of underlying
representations of the corresponding morphemes. Underlying representations of
Alutor morphemes are given in the Dictionary – see Part III. The application of
rewriting rules results in the surface representation, or the phonetic transcription.
In the present section the underlying representation of Alutor words and
morphemes is given in braces. Phonetic and practical transcriptions of words are
usually not parenthesized, but in some special cases the phonetic transcription is
given in square brackets. The application of rewriting rules is shown in round
brackets. The inventories of the surface and the underlying representations are
identical, that means we use one and the same chart of symbols for writing phones
and phonemes.
1.1. Segments
1.1.1. Vowels
1.1.1.1. Inventory
The vocalic system of Alutor consists of 11 vowels. They are: [i], [I], [u], [U], [e],
[E], [o], [O], [y], [a], [A]. The phonological status of each vowel is discussed further.
The Alutor vowels represent a typical triangle system. They are distinguished
in terms of q u a l i t y and q u a n t i t y . The aspects of quality are: t o n g u e h e i g h t
(high vs. mid vs. low), f r o n t n e s s / b a c k n e s s (front vs. central vs. back) and l i p
r o u n d i n g (rounded vs. unrounded).
The classification of vowels is given below in Table 1. The vowel [y], or schwa,
differs from all the other vowels both in length and in function. It is a supershort
vowel, while all the other vowels are of normal length (short or long – see below).","[1, 2]"

yours. [7:32]In sum, from the point of view of the proposed analysis of the optative, 1st and
3rd person forms are most closely related to its prototypical meaning, while 2nd
person forms are the natural extension of this meaning towards semantics of the
imperative 93 .
2.1.7.4. Conjunctive
The conjunctive's semantics is related to an event P that is desirable for the speaker,
but is not realized in the actual world. In contrast to the optative, also related to the
domain of desirability, the conjunctive represents the desirability of event P as a
given, without the speaker's aim to participate actively in the event. The degree of
reality of an event can vary, from highly probable, especially if the speaker is the
actor of the event, to irreal— in conditional clauses. Conjunctive verb forms are
translated in different ways.
Forms in the 1sg actor conjunctive are translated as “should not I do P”, where
P is denoted by the conjunctive verb form:

3.2.2. Word order in noun phrases

"12No connection is found between syllable boundaries and morpheme boundaries.
At the same time, there is an obvious correlation between morpheme boundaries and
the position of epenthetic schwas: the schwa often plays the role of an
“intermorpheme segment”, cf. ní-mky-qin = n-y-mk-y-qin (< {n-mk-qin})
‘numerous’ (see 1.3.3.2).
The morphology of Alutor combines morphemes in such a way that an
underlying representation may be ill-formed. It may have illicit sound strings, such as
initial syllables without onsets, illicit consonant clusters, hiatus etc. Illicit strings
usually appear word-initially and word-finally, and also at morpheme boundaries 18 .
In order to obtain well-formed words, we must modify the underlying representation
by means of certain phonological rules, among them initial consonant deletion, glottal
stop epenthesis, schwa epenthesis, and hiatus vowel deletion (see 1.3.2 and 1.3.3).
1.2.2. Rhythmic Structure
According to their rhythmic structure, all Alutor words can be divided into two main
classes:
1) words having a phonetically prominent syllable − such words are called
a c c e n t u a t e d words;
2) words with no phonetically prominent syllables − such words are called
u n a c c e n t u a t e d words.
The class of accentuated words is the most numerous. Here we find the majority
of words belonging to the main parts of speech, and also a lot of auxiliary words.
The prominence of the stressed syllable is characterised by the increase of
pronouncing energy applied mainly to the rhyme of a syllable. This is manifested in a
number of ways. If a syllable is open and the nucleus is a short vowel (but not a
supershort y), the stress is expressed by the vowel lengthening, cf. qylôvul [A]
‘husband’. If a syllable is closed, the stress is expressed by the code strengthening,
that is the syllable-final consonant. The strengthening of a final consonant is clearly
perceptible in case of the |CyC| syllable type (native speakers say that in such
syllables the stress falls on the consonant, not on the vowel), cf. wítwyt [wíttywyt]
‘flower’ 19 . It is worthy of remark that syllables of the |Cy| type cannot bear stress,
because the vowel y cannot be lengthened.","[12, 13]"
"61It is remarkable that only this agreement marker unifies S- and P-markers, cf. Tables 6-7.
The single deviation is conjunctive for 1sg.S/A (t-), coinciding with the markers of
“objective” moods (see Comment 5 to Table 5).
6247The 2nd person optative semantically coincides with the imperative 63 , because exactly in this
speech situation the speaker perlocutively affects the addressee with the speech act.
5. The 1nsg value does not differentiate between the conjunctive and the optative: these
moods have the single myn- agreement marker 64 , in contrast to 1sg. In the context of the
conjunctive 1sg uses the t- marker, identical to the one used in the unmarked moods, and such a
merger takes place only for this person. Probably the maximal degree of control on the part of the
speaker over the desirable event is important: inasmuch as the speaker has an S/A-role in the
event, the probability of its accomplishment is estimated by the speaker to be very close to real
event.
6. A unique 1sg marker is present in the optative (m-). In this mood the speaker is
simultaneously the sender as well as the recipient of the prescription. It should be taken into
account that this mood does not have its own marker and differs from the indicative only by
means of agreement markers, i.e. the speech acts with different S/A-arguments are cognitively
different. The following types of desires are distinguished: a desire addressed to the speaker
himself (m-), addressed to the speaker and other persons (myn-), addressed to the hearer and,
optionally, to other persons (n-) (in the latter case the addressee of desire being virtual rather than
actual).
TABLE 6. Transparent suffixal S-markers63Usually in Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages the mood under consideration is called
imperative, see [Zhukova 1968] (Alutor), [Zhukova 1972] (Koryak), [Volodin 1992] (Kerek),
[Skorik 1977] (Chukchi). However the semantics of 1st and 3rd persons’ S/A-arguments does not
have a perlocutive component of inducement to the action (see the separate analysis of the
meanings of these forms in [Muravyova 1990a]). It should be mentioned that Alutor rarely uses
the imperative proper, see 2.1.3.
64
At that the forms of conjunctive and optative in general are distinct.","[47, 48]"

1.1.1.3. Long and Short e and o
Vowels e and o always appear as long segments in open stressed or open pre-stressed
syllables (that is in the first or the second syllable of an Alutor word − see 1.2), cf.
@ógyv [E] ‘yesterday’, jepílNyn [E] ‘hoof’, tùrak [O] ‘sink’, lJotítkyn [O] ‘top’.
Short e and o are found in several roots in closed stressed and closed prestressed syllables before or after q and H, cf. lóqtyk [e] (along with løqtyk) ‘come
back’, HoptílJHu [o] ‘all’, qùnpyN [o] (along with qãnpyN) ‘always’. In post-stressed
syllables, both open and closed, the vowels e and o are usually short, cf. @ísse [e]
‘aunt’, tytôtoratkyn [o] ‘I'll sink’. The latter situation can be treated as standard
vowel shortening in post-stressed position − see 1.3.7 5 . Short e and o are also found
in non-accentuated auxiliary words (see 1.2.2), cf. &gemat [e] ‘maybe’, &Horo [o]
‘then’ (non-accentuated words are marked with “ & ”).
Long E and O are also found in both open and closed syllables in so-called
“expressive” words, cf. tOk ‘(interjection) let us’ (for more details see 1.3.8.1).
Expressive lengthening of this kind can be found in many languages, but such long
vowels are not considered separate phonemes.
Thus, in Alutor long and short e and o occur in positions that complement each
other. That is why we find it possible to treat a long phone and its short counterpart as
4It is worth mentioning that native speakers of Alutor are not aware of the schwa as a
segment of their pronunciation, whether predictable or not. They think some Alutor words have
only consonants; at the same time, they can easily divide such words into syllables. For instance, a
word which sounds like pyNílly ‘news’ is treated as having three syllables – |p|Nl|l| (the symbol “ |
” indicates syllable boundaries), wítwyt ‘flower’ – as |wt|wt|, HítvyHyt ‘boat’ – as |Ht|v|Ht|. The
same is true for the Koryak language. E.A.Kreynovich [Kreynovich 1958] proposed for Koryak
words the non-vocalised representation (that is without y), but with marked syllable boundaries,
like |wt|wt|. Since the schwa is not part of such representation, the author does not consider it a
phoneme. In our opinion, such approach in neither adequate nor typologically justified, because
there arises a problem of dividing words into syllables – some words have unpredictable syllable
division. Nevertheless, E.A.Kreynovich was the first to pay attention to the crucial importance of
the notion of syllable for Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages. As we will see further, this notion is
absolutely necessary to create well-formed Alutor words.
5
From an historical point of view, the Alutor long E and O originated mostly from aj and
aw, or from yj and yw, and original e and o changed into i and u in most positions (they are
preserved only in closed syllables before or after q and H – see above), cf. the following related
words from Alutor and Koryak: Alutor jepílNyn [E] – Koryak jajpylNyn ‘hoof’, Alutor lJotítkyn
[O] – Koryak lJawtytkyn ‘the top of smth.’, Alutor @imNãlyk – Koryak @emNolyk ‘to miss (smb.)’,
but Alutor lóqtyk – Koryak leqtyk ‘to come back’, Alutor qùnpyN – Koryak qonpyN ‘always’
(these correspondences are discussed in detail in [Muravyova 1986a]).","[4, 5]"
"3839CHAPTER 2. Morphology
In this chapter we consider the main word classes, rich in inflectional morphology,
namely, the verb, adjective, noun, and pronoun.
2.1. Verbs
The verbs can be divided into two classes, f i n i t e (inflected) and n o n - f i n i t e .
Finite forms are defined as compatible with the head predicate position of an
independent clause. Non-finite forms can occupy the head predicate position of a
subordinate clause as well as be part of the analytical verb form.
Finite forms have several conjugations depending on the number of agreement
slots. First of all there are polypersonal and monopersonal conjugations. In
p o l y p e r s o n a l conjugation the verb has two agreement slots: a prefix and a suffix
slot. Transitive verbs agree with the agentive and patientive arguments (referred to
below as A - a n d P - a r g u m e n t s ). Intransitive verbs agree with the sole core
argument 46 (referred to below as S - a r g u m e n t ). It is important that the S/Aargument, i.e. the argument bearing the Principal hyperrole (see argumentation
below) is the main controller of agreement. In m o n o p e r s o n a l conjugation the verb
has only one agreement slot – the suffix slot controlled by the S/P-argument, i.e. the
argument bearing the Absolutive hyperrole. Furthermore there is a number of
i m p e r s o n a l forms that do not distinguish person values of core arguments.
First, we will consider three conjugation types of finite and non-finite verb
forms.
2.1.1. Polypersonal conjugation of finite verb
Polypersonal conjugation is notable for a specific set of grammatical categories as
well as agreement encoding.
2.1.1.1. Grammatical categories of polypersonal conjugation
Polypersonal conjugation is specified by the following categories: aspect, mood, and
person-number agreement with the core arguments of intransitive and transitive
verbs. There are two values for a s p e c t : perfective (PF) and imperfective (IPF).
P e r f e c t i v e has an unmarked value, it coincides with the verb's stem,
i m p e r f e c t i v e has a suffix marker -tky /-tkyn /-tkyni (its ending depends on the
type of the following morphemes 47 ).
46
47In this case both agreement slots are used, see below.
The distribution of the imperfective’s allomorphs (-tky /-tkyn /-tkyni-) is not quite clear.","[38, 39, 40]"

sky’ (cf. HøHyk ‘in the sky’), @amkykO ‘very many’ (cf. @ômkyka ‘many’). Native
speakers do not perceive such long vowels as stressed ones.
1.3. Phonological Processes
Alutor exhibits a great variety of phonological processes22 . Here we find various
segmental changes − a l t e r n a t i o n s , as well as root copying − r e d u p l i c a t i o n s .
Among alternations there are replacements (including assimilations of different types,
lenitions and fortitions, coalescences, etc.), insertions and deletions, and also
metatheses. The most important phonological process in Alutor is that of creating the
right syllable and rhythmic structure: some phonological processes help to create the
right structure, while others take place only after the right structure has been created.
Most Alutor alternations are phonologically conditioned, but there are also many
alternations that are morphologically conditioned (the latter will be described in this
section too).
Alutor phonological processes are represented here in the form of rewriting
rules. The rules apply to the underlying representation of a word, that is a sequence of
underlying representations of morphemes constituting the word. Underlying
representations of morphemes are given in the Dictionary − see Part III. The result of
application is the surface representation, i.e. the phonetic transcription of a given
word. The rules are listed here in the order they should apply to the underlying
representation (the only exception is mentioned in 1.3.3.2).
The majority of rules given below describe various segment modifications; they
are numbered with Arabic numerals. There are also the stress assignment rules – they
are numbered with Roman numerals. Besides, there are some additional rules that do
not change the structure of words, but mark syllable boundaries and types of syllables
– they are numbered with capital letters.
Each rule is given in two variants: as an ordinary utterance and as a formal rule.
The notation we use for formal rules is X ⇒ Y / A_B, which means that a segment
(or a string of segments) X is replaced by a segment (or a string of segments) Y in the
context defined by A_B. The bar “ _ ” marks the position of the segment undergoing
the process. The context A and B may contain: symbols for consonants and vowels –
C and V, their phonological properties (shown by the lowered script), a morpheme
(M) the segment belongs to - a root (R) or an affix (this is marked with “ ∈ ”), some

Incorporation is a device that simplifies the syntactic structure of a clause. It121decreases the syntactic rank of constituents that are out of the scope of assertion and,
more generally, beyond the focus of attention 124 . If incorporation affects the
constituent that occupies a prestigious position in a clause, it opens the possibility of
raising the status of another constituent occupying a peripheral position in the initial
structure.
Along with this, it is possible to confirm the usage of incorporation for the
purpose of overcoming syntactic restrictions over syntactic structure. For example, l@- participles form reduced relative clauses whose nominative argument is
coreferential with the head NP. With respect to this restriction it is sometimes
necessary to free the nominative position, incorporating the P-argument of a transitive
verb:

Usually there is a distinction between existential, taxonomic, characterizing, and
identificational nominal clauses. In Alutor existential clauses are opposed to all other
types of nominal clauses.
3.3.1. Status of existential clauses
Alutor existential clauses are not in the strict sense nominal. They have the verb it‘be, be found’ governing the nominative S-argument.
(36) a. to
andymqa-ninjil@alNy.tumgy-nEmqa-POSS.SG+3sgmale.cousin-NOM+SGg-ity-lqiv-lin...

below), there are grounds to consider existential clauses verbal.
3.3.2. Taxonomic clauses
Taxonomic clauses indicating the membership of a nominal argument in a class of
objects have two main patterns. T h e f i r s t , most natural pattern is a combination of
two adjacent NPs, one of them being the S-argument, and the other the predicate:
(37) a. qutawwyjNy-nin
[Qutawweyngen-POSS.SG+3sgqetakalNy-nHaqaniNvitbrother-NOM+SGAqaningvit+NOM+SG]126qajylJHinny-kin.
[Qayelinne-REL+3sg]
{LC: Once there lived an old man from Alut {the village Alutorka} called
Qutawweyngen and his wife Kemlingawet.} (And) Qutawweyngen's brother
Aqaningvit, (was) from Qayelinnen {the village Khayilino}. [30:2]b. tur.ginsinin.kin[your+3sgqetakalNy-none's.own+3sgHaqaniNvit.brother-NOM+SG][Aqaningvit+NOM+SG]Aqaningvit is your own brother. [30:16]In (37a) the order of NPs is SV, in (37b) it is inversed: VS. The nominal
argument can be expressed as a demonstrative/deictic pronoun wuttin ‘this’:
(38)wutt.inkysim=@ujpy-lNyn,wutt.inlyla=@ujpy-lNyn,[[this+3sg][kidney=stick-NOM+SG]][[this+3sg][eye=stick-NOM+SG]]wutt.inpunta=@ujpy-lNyn.[[this+3sg][liver=stick-NOM+SG]]{LC: She went out for a stick for roasting:} This is a stick for the kidney. This is a stick
for the eyes. This is a stick for the liver. [14:13]The head of a predicate NP is marked with the predicative form of a noun (see
2.3.2), namely the overt personal markers controlled by 1st/2nd person S-arguments:
(39)tita-kin-egymgymmy(N)gy.nin-egymNav.akk-egym.when-REL-1sgI+NOMyour+1sgdaughter-1sgOnce I was your daughter. [6:33]In the predicate NP titakin-egym gy.nin-egym Navakk-egym ‘your once upon
a time daughter’ its head Navakk-egym, as well as modifiers agree in person-number
with the S-argument.
T h e s e c o n d pattern uses the verb it- that has in this context the meaning
‘be, serve as’ <smb.: N, as smb.: Eq>. This verb is compatible with the values of all
verbal categories in accordance with the semantics of the clause. In the predicate
position the noun is marked with the equative:
(40) a. jaqqy
wellynnua-lJylJa-ki-nun-it-qin.(s)he+NOMA-eye-CARIT-EQUATADJ`-be-ADJ`+3sgActually she was blind. [35:10]127b. y.ninny

in (40b) by a substantivized participle, and in (40c) by a noun 126 .
3.3.3. Characterizing clauses
Characterizing clauses add individual properties to the noun's referent. In the
predicate position the use of adjectives is the most natural.

KellelqitgenaquKellelqitgenaqu was always playing the drum [=never stopped playing the drum]. [8:2]1293.3.4. Identification clauses
Identification clauses have the same structure as other nominal clauses: they consist
of two adjacent NPs being in a relation of referential identity. The auxiliary verb it‘be, be found’ marked with the resultative can also be used:
(47) a. waj-@ynnul-egym
here-the.same-1sgqungymmy ...wellI+NOMLook, I am the very one... [8:52]b. to

3.4. Relative clause
In Alutor there are two main means of a relative clause formation — with the help of
the participle construction or the finite subordinate clause.
3.4.1. Participle strategy
The -l@- participle marks the head of a relative clause if both coreferential NPs are
marked with the nominative. The dependent NP can be omitted or reduced to a
relative pronoun maNin/maNki ‘which/where’ often combined with the correlative
pronoun qynut ‘as/such/there’ 127 .

The order of the main and subordinate clauses is not fixed. Besides, the embedding of
parts of the subordinate clause into the main clause is possible:
(35) numal·nim
againally
notmaN.ki
whereitgyp.at-ka
be.known-PRED`g-ity-lqiv-linNan.inqura.ra.mky-n.","[125, 126]"
"In this way, the antipassive is not obligatorily followed by a decrease in
transitivity; see (10b).
In Alutor there are verbs that are always accompanied by the ina- marker, for
example, in.emy- ‘scoop, draw’ (etymologically bound with the intransitive verb
emy- ‘go for water’). This verb has three arguments (agent, patient, and instrument),
optionally complemented by benefactive. The interpretation is possible that in
primary diathesis there is no argument that fills the highest position, therefore the
location of any argument in this position is marked with the inversion marker:
(11) a. ynnu
he+NOMin.emy-tky-nmiml-aeminaN-aANTI.draw.out-3sg.Swater-ERGscoop-ERGtumgy-N.

In a number of cases the use of the antipassive is motivated by the
c o m m u n i c a t i v e s t r u c t u r e of an utterance, namely by the need of the speaker
to focus attention on an argument occupying a non-central position in the verbal
government pattern or, conversely, to remove an argument from a pragmatically
salient position. Thus in the following examples the use of the antipassive is
motivated by the need to remove the patient from the utterance:116(12) a. ...ina-tg.aty-tkyn
ANTI-dig-IPFtatulJ-pilJsasusaNawyt.fox-DIMIN+NOM+SGSasusangawet{LC: Later she saw, not far away} a vixen (named) Sasusangawet {=“foxwoman”}(who) was digging. [11:2]b. ynNin
thisynpyNavqiwwa.Nina-ly@u-tkyn.old.woman.NOMbadlyANTI-see-IPFThis old woman sees badly.","[116, 117]"
"122type of causative derivation is a very productive means of increasing transitivity.
Besides this, a causative derivate can heighten the status of a peripheral argument
without adding a new argument. For example, the intransitive verb ‘walk around’
<smb.: N, smth.: L> becomes transitive under causativization, cf.:
(27) a. gymmy
I+NOMty-kamlily-krara-k.1sg.S-walk.around-1sg.Shouse-LOCI walked around the house. [a=b]b. gym-nan
I-ERGty-n.kamlil.avy-nrara-Na.1sg.A-walk.around-3sg.Phouse-NOM+SGIn (27b) the causative verb re-interprets the initial peripheral argument ‘house’
as the Absolutive. Initial S-argument receives an iconic agentive marking in the
ergative case.
3.1.6. Dative agreement
Transitive verbs usually agree with A- and P-arguments. However a personal
recipient/addressee of a three-place verb can “usurp” control over the P-marker:
(28)aktykamy-jyl-gytjava-l@-uwwi ...impossible1sg.A+OPT-give-2sg.Puse-ATR-NOM+PLI can't give you (my) clothes [=those I'm using]. {RC: Later my husband will come, and
I will give you the clothes on the sledge.} [7:34]The P-argument javal@uwwi ‘used’ preserves its nominative marking, however
the verb agrees with the recipient ‘to you’. In such clauses the properties of a Pargument are distributed between the patient (case) and recipient (agreement).
3.2. Word order
Alutor has free word order. It is often difficult to claim which order is basic.
Discontinuous constituents are also possible.
3.2.1. Word order in a predicate-argument structure
In verbal clauses the most frequent word order structures are SVO and VSO:
(29) a. tita·qaqutkinJnJaqu-nakmaN.ki·@anaone.dayQutkinnaqu-ERG+SGsomewhere123ga-la@u-linynny-@yn.","[122, 123, 124]"

Nav=HytHy-turu,Hymul@y-turu ...female=dog-2plweakling-2plYou bitches, you weaklings, {RC: you, oh, you couldn't kill me!} [17:23]Example (80c) shows that the S-actant itself may be absent, but it still controls
the agreement of the predicate.
The predicative is also used as an apposition for another noun or pronoun (the
pronoun itself may be absent).
(81)yjOwytina-n.tymNi.v-la-tyklong.time.agoNan-ynnul-egym ...1sg.P-lose-PLUR-2nsg.Athere-the.same-1sgLong, long ago you lost me. That's me ... [6:35]The predicative is also used when addressing somebody:

The adjectival form of a noun is actually the result of a derivational process, when a
noun becomes an adjective. We distinguish between relative (REL), possessive
(POSS), habitive (HABIT) and caritive (CARIT) adjectives, see 2.2.2. From a
syntactic point of view an adjectival is used in the role of the genitive, sometimes the
ablative, which occur in other languages with case systems.
2.3.4. Noun incorporation
A noun in the nominal can by incorporated by a verb or other noun. Thus, we have
v e r b a l composites, with a verb as the head, and n o m i n a l composites, with a
noun as the head, (for details see 3.1.4). An adjectival (= denominal adjective) can
also be incorporated (see 2.2.4 above). Incorporated nouns have no category markers;
incorporated denominal adjectives may preserve their adjectivizers -kin and -in,
which are referred to as derivational affixes.
Nouns are easily incorporated when they have no modifiers in the underlying
syntactic structure, and the speaker refers to the corresponding objects as background103information (for details see 3.1.4).
Nouns are incorporated by other nouns when they are used attributively in the
underlying structure and denote non-specific objects, for instance: tanNy=@irra-n
‘the enemy party’ [21:10], Hasu=nym.jyr@y-n ‘a village of pink salmon’ [3:21],
viHe=rara-Na ‘a grass house’ [6:16], wir=imyt ‘the load of alder bark’ [7:8]. Not all
linguists consider this type of compounding incorporation, but it is obviously a highly
productive type of compounding.","[102, 103, 104]"
"NEG-pick.berries-go-ANLT1nsg.S+OPT-be-IPFWe won't have to go picking berries. [7:18]It the context of a 3rd person S/A-argument, the optative refers to the speaker's

[10:29]This example convincingly testifies to the failure of an imperative interpretation
of these forms in the 3rd person. In the context of the 3rd person, the subject of the
wish does not have to coincide with the speaker.

"1.1.1.2. Phonological Status of Schwa
The phonological status of schwa is one of the most interesting problems of the
Chukchi-Kamchatkan phonology. Some authors (see, for instance, [Zhukovа 1968])
regard this vowel as a purely auxiliary segment and do not include it in the inventory
of phonemes. Actually, the fact that the schwa is predictable in many contexts is
rather obvious. In such cases the surface representation of a word containing y can be
derived from the underlying representation without y (= the “non-vocalized”
representation) by means of simple insertion rules (see 1.3.3.2). For example, if a
word sounds like tyjôtyk ‘I came’, it can be derived from *tjatk. Here the schwas
break up the word-initial and the word-final consonant clusters. Thus, in this word, as
well as in many other words, y is just an epenthetic. This means that the schwa is

pure agreement marker is the suffix marker -tyk ‘2nsg’ 61 .
Tables 5-6 show a formal correspondence between combined markers and their
grammatical values. However, from the point of view of an explanatory description
such a formal correspondence is absolutely insufficient. It is natural to suppose that
the means of merging the values of person, mood, and aspect into single markers are
not random, they are motivated in many cases by the nature of these values
themselves. Some assumptions of this kind are presented in the Comments on the
tables, though a full explanatory description is the goal of further investigations.

1. S/A-markers consistently merge the indicative and the potential as bjective moods.
The use of these moods presupposes the existence of corresponding events. The indicative mood
characterizes the event as existing in a real world, and the potential mood, as existing in a virtual
world. The conjunctive and the optative are unified by the idea of esirable modality: they
indicate the events of the world of a speaker's desires (see the semantics of mood in 2.1.7.1 —
2.1.7.4).
2. In unmarked bjective moods (IND and POT) only locutors have the prefixal
agreement markers, and these markers can be considered pure. In esirable moods the mood
and deictic values are combined 62 , therefore non-locutors also have prefix markers.
3. 2nd and 3rd person conjunctives (CONJ) have the single marker n-, indicating a S/Aparticipant, whom the speaker does not control. The choice of the same marker for 3rd person
optative (OPT) is not random.
4. 2nd person optative has a specific marker q-, which is differentiated from the 3rd person.","[46, 47]"
"108Besides demonstrative adjectives, there are also demonstrative adverbs derived
from the same roots: wutku ‘here’, wutkepyN ‘from here’, Nanyk ‘there’, igynNinak
‘that is why’ and others. In order to express great distance from the speaker and the
hearer the iconic vowel lengthening is used (see 1.3.8.1), for instance, instead of
Nanyk ‘there’ the form NOnyk ‘far over there’ is often used.
2.4.4. Interrogative pronouns
The following two interrogative nouns are used in Alutor: {taq} ‘what’ ( tinga ‘what,
NOM+SG’) and {mik} ‘who’ (migga ‘who, NOM+SG’). They are used very much
like nouns. The pronoun ‘what’ is declined as a word of the 1st declension, and the
pronoun ‘who’ − as a word of the 2nd declension. The pronoun ‘what’ is used not
only in the singular, but also in the plural (cf. taq-uwwi ‘what, NOM+PL’ [17:13]).
Being used predicatively, these pronouns agree with their S-actant (which can
be omitted) in person and number:
(84)mik-igyt?
who-2sg
Who are you? [5:12]When the pronoun {taq} ‘what’ is used attributively in the underlying structure,
it is obligatorily incorporated; in this case it means ‘what; what kind of’ 114 . Compare:
(85)taq=Nav.@an-igyt?
what=wife-2sg
(It's not important) whose wife you are. [13:10]A pronoun similar to the adjectival form is found only for the pronoun ‘who’ −
it is the possessive pronoun mik.in(a)- ‘whose’ 115 . It is used like any other
possessive adjective marked with -in(a) and it may be substantivized like any other
pronominal adjective.","[108, 109]"
"86(Once) a rich man Qisgayat became sick. [29:4]In example (61) the form pyttuNy-l@y-n ‘the rich’ is derived from the adjective
ny-pyttuN-qin ‘rich’. Such forms can be used both attributively (as appositions) and
non-attributively (as nouns). Being used attributively, they agree in case and number
with the head noun.
The highest degree of quality can also be expressed by means of the suffix -s@,
identical with the verbal attributivizer expressing intense actions. The suffix is often

is optional, while in case of a head noun in an oblique case incorporation is obligatory
(in other words, noun phrases marked with an oblique case cannot have free

Different head noun modifiers can be the targets of NP incorporation. First,
adjectives, determiners, and numerals can be the targets of incorporation.

coreferential argument of a subordinate clause headed by the participle, should have

Besides there is also the attributivizer -s@- that means ‘holding the property in great
degree’, for example: aNaNy-l@y-n ‘that who is godlike, shaman’ (cf.aNaN- ‘godlike’) — aNaNys@y-n ‘the strongest between shamans’.","[69, 70]"
"13In unaccentuated words the vowel length contrast is hardly detectable. It should
be noted that unaccentuated words can be clearly distinguished only if the syllable
supposed to bear stress is an open one, cf. jônut [A] ‘today’ vs. &janut [a] ‘earlier’
(the symbol “ & ” indicates the absence of stress in a word), @inøri [I] ‘blanket’ vs.
&siriri [i] ‘sandpiper’. If such syllable is a closed one, it is more difficult to reveal the
absence of stress.
The position of stress in Alutor can be described in terms of syllable weight,
thus it is a quantity sensitive system. Two types of syllables are distinguished here:
l i g h t (mono-moraic) syllables and h e a v y (bi-moraic) syllables. Syllables of the
|Сy| type are light syllables, while the other types are all heavy.
The position of stress in accentuated words is determined by the following three
phonological constraints:
1) only a heavy syllable can bear stress; light syllables are always unstressed;
2) only the first or the second syllable can bear stress (but the second syllable is
preferable);
3) a word-final syllable cannot bear stress.
These constraints help us to describe all the possible rhythmic patterns. First of
all, a monosyllabic cannot bear stress, for its only syllable is the final one (but there
exist some unaccentuated monosyllablic auxiliary words − see below). In case of a
disyllabic accentuated word, the first syllable is stressed (it always appears to be a
heavy one), for instance, @ôkyk ‘son’, kíttil ‘forehead’, wôla ‘knife’ 20 . Polysyllabics
may have stress either on the first or the second syllable, cf. tølpyqal ‘shoulder’,
tírgytyr ‘meat’, nØgyqin ‘cool’, vitôtyk ‘work’, NyrôlNyn ‘knee’, vagílNyn ‘nail, claw’.
For details see the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.).
The class of unaccentuated words is represented by the following groups and
subgroups:
1) auxiliary words of different types, such as conjunctions, particles,
introductory words, and also some adverbs, cf. &qinaq ‘in order to’, &Horo ‘then’,
&matka ‘whether’, &kytvyl ‘not (prohibition)’, &gemat ‘maybe’, &agi ‘very’, &lygan
‘even’, &wasaq ‘sometimes’, &jaqi ‘later’;
2) some personal pronoun forms, such as:
a) the dative form with a light second syllable, cf. &gymykyN ‘to me’, &gynykyN
‘to you (sg)’, &@ynykyN ‘to him’, &murykyN ‘to us’, &turykyN ‘to you (pl)’, &@ytykyN
20Actually, when morphemes are combined into a word, at intermediate stages there may
appear a monosyllabic word with the only stressed syllable or a disyllabic word with the second
stressed syllable, but such intermediate representations are then extended by means of some
special rules (see 1.3.4.3), cf. Nôjjy (< Nôj < {Naj-∅}) ‘mountain’, Nyvã-jjy (< Nyvã-j < {Nvu-j})
‘(s)he/it began’, gyvô-kki (< gyvô-k < {gva-k}) ‘to stick’.","[13, 14]"
"Words that do not acquire stress according to these rules are considered
unaccentuated, cf. &najylyn ‘they gave him/her/it’, &tyjylyn ‘I gave him/her/it’ (the
accentuated root {jyl}), &tyHalJulJun ‘I rocked him/her to sleep’ (the unaccentuated
root {HalJulJu}) (some exceptions were mentioned in 1.2.2, group 4b).
1.3.4.3. Syllable Addition
It appears that the rhythmic structure of the language does not permit stress to fall on
the last syllable of a word, but strings with the last stressed syllable may appear at
intermediate stages of derivation (see rules I and II). In order to improve the rhythmic
structure a supplementary syllable is added.
The syllable addition rules run as follows:
if the stress falls on the last (closed) syllable of a word, a supplementary
syllable of the |CV| type is added by means of geminating the last consonant and
35In Alutor there are neither stressed disyllabics with the second light syllable nor stressed
disyllabics with the first light and the second open syllable.
36
Otherwise, i.e. if the first syllable is light, the word does not acquire any stress.",[25]
"10w and j are glides, which may coalesce with the preceding vowel syllable-finally (see
1.3.6). As we have mentioned above, the consonant @ also acts like a glide in the
same context.

1.2. Syllable and Rhythmic structure
1.2.1. Syllable Structure
Alutor imposes strict conditions on syllable structure, and the notion of syllable is
essential for the phonological pattern of the Alutor language.
If we consider the main classes of sounds − consonants and vowels − the
canonical syllable patterns will be |CV| and |CVC| (the symbol “ | ” indicates a
syllable boundary). These patterns have only one constraint: if the nucleus of a
syllable is a long vowel, the syllable has no coda. Thus, in reality we find the
following syllable patterns: |Cy|, |СVshort|, |CVlong|, |CyC|, |СVshortC| (here V is a nonschwa vowel), cf. |vi|tô|tyk| ‘work’, |tøl|my|til| ‘eagle’, |@øt|@yn| ‘fur coat’, |@a|lô|@al|
‘summer’, |jØ|ly|jil| ‘tongue’, |wi|rã|wir| ‘(kind of) salmon’, |ja|tít|kyn| ‘(s)he is
coming’.
The set of syllable patterns given above is valid only if we consider a careful,
distinct pronunciation, which we will call the standard pronunciation. In fluent speech
native speakers may often elide the schwa in a two or three consonant cluster (one of
the consonants is usually a sonorant), so there may appear some consonant clusters,
illicit in the standard pronunciation. Thus, we often find optional words pronounced
of other syllable types, such as |CCV| and |CCVC|, cf. qylôvul ~ qlôvul ‘husband’,
@ínkyjap ~ @ínkjap ‘long ago’ 17 . In the present paper we prefer to deal only with the
standard pronunciation.
Word boundaries in Alutor always coincide with syllable boundaries, for
instance, @ógyv|#@arNønati (not *@ógy|v#ar|Nønati) ‘It rained yesterday’.
In reduplications the boundary between the two root morphs also coincides with
the syllable boundary, cf. @ønmy|@in (< {inm=in}) ( not *@in|min) ‘gulp’. The same is
true with incorporations and productive compounds, but only if the second stem
begins with a vowel, cf. mis@ô=@it@yl@yn (< {mis@a=it-l@-n}) ‘the one in a beautiful
fur coat’, sasø=@ilNatgyrNyn (< {sasi=ilN-at-gyrN-n}) ‘watchstrap’. In some
compounds there is no glottal stop before an initial vowel of the second stem, and the
syllable begins with a preceding consonant, cf. tig-ølNyn (< {tig-ilN-N}) ‘ski strap’.
17The same situation is found in related languages. Some Koryak dictionaries (for instance,
[Korsakov 1939a]) register the standard pronunciation, while others (for instance, [Zhukova
1967]) record the fluent speech, cf. myjen ~ mjen ‘mosquito’. As P.Ja.Skorik writes [Skorik
1961:63], in Chukchi the process of omitting schwas “ is more widely spread in the western
dialect than in the eastern one”.","[10, 11, 12]"
"16special morpheme properties (also shown by the lowered script). Irrelevant segments
that separate X from A or B are marked in the context with “ ... ”. The symbol ∧
represents the null segment. The following symbols are used to indicate different
types of boundaries: “ # ” for a word boundary, “ = ” for a composite boundary, and “
- ” for an ordinary morpheme boundary. To describe the context, the logical
conjunctions “and” and “or” are sometimes used (they are underlined). All the rules
given below are illustrated by Alutor words. For each word we write its practical
transcription (see 1.3.12) and show its “phonological derivation”, that is a sequence
of several relevant intermediate stages coming from the underlying representation.
The derivation of a word is shown in round brackets and is marked with “ < ” (which
means “comes from”). The underlying representation is given in braces, the relevant
intermediate steps – without any brackets (but within the round brackets). Other
notations used in the rules are listed in Abbreviations and Symbols.
1.3.1. Reduplication
Reduplication in Alutor is used as a means of forming the nominative singular. The
information whether a noun employs reduplication to form the nominative singular is
shown in the Dictionary, the exact morphological structure of a word is defined by
morphological rules, so in this section we only describe the way a root copy is
formed. In Alutor a root copy always follows the corresponding root and consists of
only one syllable.
The root copy of a given reduplication is formed according to the following
rules (Rred marks a root to be reduplicated):
if a root to be reduplicated begins with a single consonant, the root copy
consists of the first three segments of the root, if it begins with a two-consonant
cluster or a vowel, the root copy consists of the first two segments of the root, i.e.
(1) 23 a. C1V1C2(…) ⇒ C1V1C2(…)=C1V1C2 / #_ and C1V1C2 ∈ Rred
b. C1C2... ⇒ C1C2...=C1C2 / #_ and C1C2 ∈ Rred
c. V1C1... ⇒ V1C1...=V1C1 / #_ and V1C1 ∈ Rred
Examples: kaltøkal (< {kaltired}) ‘beetle’, kãmNykum 24 (< kumN=kum
< {kumNred}) ‘voice’, HasãHas (< {Hasured}) ‘pink salmon’, wirãwir (< {wirured})
‘(kind of) salmon’, HÔlyHal (< HAly=HAl < {HAlyred}) ‘axe’, nykønyk (< nki=nk <
{nkired}) ‘night’, @anã@an (< anu=an < {anured}) ‘spring’, @ãjpy@uj (< ujp=uj <
{ujpred}) ‘prize’.
23Let us be reminded once again that the rules are given here in the order they should apply
to the underlying representation.
24
After the described operation, some other modifications take place (for instance, the
segments y and @ are epenthesized).","[16, 17]"
"311.3.10. Irregular Distant Dental Palatalisations
Alutor alternations which we call distant palatalizations are rather peculiar from a
typological point of view. The alternation itself looks like this: in some morphemes
(mostly roots) a dental non-palatalized consonant changes into its palatalized
correlate in the context defined by another morpheme of the same word (mostly an
affix), cf. vilJãpilJ (< {vilu-pilJ}) ‘little ear’. Since some such morphemes (but not all
of them) contain a palatalized consonant and the changing segment becomes a
palatalized one, we treat this process as distant palatalization, and refer to the
corresponding morphemes as “palatalizing” ones 43 .
The process takes place in roughly the following environment:
if there is a palatalizing morpheme in a word, a non-palatalized dental t, n, or l
changes into its palatalized counterpart s (seldom tJ), nJ, or lJ (in some cases s)
respectively, i.e.
(24) a. t ⇒ s (seldom tJ ) / ∃Mpalatalizing
b. n ⇒ nJ / ∃Mpalatalizing
c. l ⇒ lJ (in some cases s) / ∃Mpalatalizing.
Examples: gasvôs@atylqivlin (< {ga-(t)va-s@at-lqiv-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he was
sitting’, anJãs@atyk (< {anu-s@at-k}) ‘spend spring’, alJôs@atyk (< {ala-s@at-k})
‘spend summer’, nJyvøssykuk 44 (< {nvil-tku-k}) ‘stop (repeatedly)’, lJóvytkuk (<
{levy-tku-k}) ‘walk’, mysôtkuk (< {mla-tku-k}) ‘break’.
But in reality the distribution of the alternants and the context they appear in
turn out to be more complicated than it is shown in the above-mentioned rule. First,
palatalizing morphemes may not contain a palatalized consonant 45 , cf. HønJnJykvyn (<
{Hinn-kv-n}) ‘scarf’ ({kv} is a palatalizing suffix). Second, palatalizing affixes may
cause palatalization in one root and not affect another root, cf. lJóvytkuk (< {levy-tkuk}) ‘walk’, but @ôngytytkuk (< {angyt-tku-k}) ‘celebrate’ ({tku} is a palatalizing
suffix). Third, it is difficult to find a strict distribution between the palatalized
consonants lJ and s (actually, we think that the alternation l/s is more ancient, while
l/lJ is an innovation). Fourth, there exist not only palatalizing affixes, but also
palatalizing roots, for palatalization appears in some affixes, cf. nJãmqin (< {n-umqin(a)}) ‘warm’ ({um} should be treated as palatalizing root), but nurôqin ‘distant’.
And finally, there are duplicate affixes with the alternation l/s, which slightly differ
43A.N.Zhukova [Zhukova 1972] refers to similar alternations in the Koryak language as
“consonant harmony”.
44
When the dental of a root is palatalized, the dental of an affix is usually palatalized too.
45
At the same time, if an affix has a palatalized consonant, it is not necessarily a palatalizing
one.","[31, 32]"
"872.2.2. Relative adjectives
R e l a t i v e adjectives (= the adjectival form of a noun), express a general modifying
meaning. They are usually derived from nouns, and sometimes from adverbs and
verbs. They are marked with the adjectivizer -kin(a) (further shortened to kin). Being
used attributively, a relative adjective agrees in person and number with its S-actant.
Thus, in the 3rd person it is marked with kin/-kina-t/-kina(-w(wwi)) ‘3sg/du/pl’,
and in the 1st or 2nd person the standard person-number markers are used, following
the adjectivizer -kin(a), for instance, -kin-egym 100 ‘1sg’, see Table 13.

100The endings -egym/-egyt are phonological variants of the agreement markers -jgym/jgyt, which are added to the suffix ending in a-, namely -kina.
101
Thus, the allative and ablative functions have no special markers in Alutor.","[87, 88]"

3.4.2. Finite strategy

predicatively (see 3.3), but the first use is more frequent.
Like other attributes without a head noun, adjectives may be substantivized. In
such situations a person-number form is used as a nominative case form.

nominative) are not found in Alutor.
Another adjective form is derived from a qualitative stem by means of a-...-ka.
It is called the p r e d i c a t i v e form. Its only function is to indicate a predicate 97 :

Thus, there are two adjective forms used predicatively: the form marked with n-...-qin
and the form marked with a-...-ka. Their distribution is not clear, but it is possible that they
express the difference between the permanent and temporary state respectively (so they are
similar to Russian full and short adjectives).","[84, 85]"

always a post-stressed one. In most cases it is the vowel a that undergoes the
transformation, but some roots truncate their final i or u. The process is partly
morphologically defined, because morphemes truncating their final vowels form a
restricted group of the lexicon. In the Dictionary the final vowel of such roots (and
suffixes – see below) is shown in round brackets, cf. tôtul (the root {tatul(a)}) ‘fox’.
Some roots ending in a vowel do not truncate their final vowel, cf. pãnta (the root
{punta}) ‘liver’, @inøri (the root {iniri}) ‘blanket’.
The deletion is also attested for some suffixes, for example, the possessive
suffix {-in(a)} and other adjectival suffixes that historically originated from the
former, such as {-kin(a)}, {-lin(a)}, {-qin(a)}. The deletion of a root-final vowel
may also occur in a composite, so in this respect the vowel deletion is similar to the
consonant deletion.
The rules regulating final vowel deletion run as follows:
if a morpheme is marked for vowel deletion, it loses its final vowel in word-final
position; the deletion may also occur when the morpheme appears as a non-final part
of a composite, i.e.
(3)a. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _# and V1∈ Mvowel deletion
b. V1 ⇒ ∧ / _= and V1∈ Mvowel deletion (not regularly)
Examples: tôtul (< {tatul(a)}) ‘fox’, cf. tatãla-wwi ‘foxes’; @ømyt (< imt <
{imt(i)}) ‘burden’, cf. @imtø-ta ‘by a burden’; @yllôNi (< yllaNj < {yllaNj(u)})
‘younger brother’, cf. @yllôNju-ta ‘by a younger brother’; @aNqôkin (< {aNqakin(a)}) ‘sea, marine (sg)’, cf. @aNqô-kina-wwi ‘sea, marine (pl)’; @asgønHylJu (<
asgin=HylJu < {asgi-in(a)=(t)Hylw}) ‘today’.
1.3.2.3. Hiatus Vowel Deletion
Two vowels may occur adjacently in the underlying representation only at a
morpheme boundary. Since hiatus is impermissible in Alutor, the situation may be
remedied in two different ways:
1) a glottal stop is epenthesized between the vowels (the epenthesis rules are
given in 1.3.3.1) − this usually happens at a composite boundary, for instance,
ra@øtynvyl@yn (< {ra=it-nv-l@-n}) ‘master of the house’;
2) one of two vowels is deleted − this usually happens at an ordinary morpheme26In the section “Morphology” (see Chapter 2) the final vowel deletion is treated as a
morphological means of forming the nominative singular, but in the section “Phonology” we
prefer to describe the vowel deletion as a phonological process.","[18, 19]"
