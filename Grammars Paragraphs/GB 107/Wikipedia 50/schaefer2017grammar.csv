"3 Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs
Emai inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories follow the grammatical subject
phrase and precede the initial verb of the predicate phrase. Inflection consists of
affirmative and negative aspect categories. They precede the auxiliary categories of
modality and relative tense, in that order. Preverbs follow auxiliaries.
ASPECT MODALITY RELATIVE-TENSE PREVERB3.1 Inflectional and auxiliary categories
Segmental morphemes that convey affirmative and negative inflection, modality
(deontic and epistemic) and relative tense are the following:
Affirmative Aspect
ò/à Habitual
ó/á Continuous
ló Predictive

kpe SubsequentInflection, specifically affirmative and negative aspect, along with subject
phrase tone is the cornerstone of Emai tonal structure within a clause. Affirmative
polarity shows perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect. No segmental forms convey perfect aspect; instead, perfect aspect is signaled by subject phrase tone and
predicate phrase tone. Segmental forms that are mutually exclusive express imperfect and prospective aspect. Imperfect, when realized by a lexical rather than pronominal subject, requires subject concord. In the expression of perfect and prospective aspect, concord is rarely exploited. Distinctions within perfect and prospective
are conveyed by a contrast in subject phrase tone. Negative polarity consists of Perfect, Prospective, and Past Absolute categories. When realized by a lexical rather
than pronominal subject, negation requires subject concord.","[124, 125]"
"11A note on adverb order concerns the simile phrase marked by bi. It manifests highly restricted
distribution relative to all adverb classes except ideophones. Simile exponents follow but do not
precede Manner ideophones (kpèkèkpèkè, nyágányágá, bìbìbíbí).
(i) ójè ò ó shàn nyágányágá, bí ólí émáí nwú
vbì ègèìn.
Oje SC C walk awkwardly like one boil PAP.catch LOC crotch
‘Oje is walking awkwardly, like someone who has a boil at the crotch.’Simile expressions with bi never occur with Manner-demonstrative adverbs, e.g. ìná, regardless of
the latter’s position.
(ii) *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé, bí éwè ìná.
the youth
SC C eat food like goat PMD
‘The youth is eating food like a goat that way.’344 | Adverbial adjunctsLikewise, simile bi phrases fail to precede or follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis (ènyáà), Frequency
(sáà) or Place (vbì ìwè).
(iii) a. *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé ènyáà, bí éwè.
the youth
SC C eat food just.now like goat
‘The youth is eating food just now like a goat.’
b. *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé sáà,
bí éwè.
the youth
SC H eat food always like goat
‘The youth always eats food like a goat.’
c. *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé vbì ìwè, bí éwè.
the youth
SC C eat food LOC house like goat
‘The youth is eating food in the house like a goat.’
12Additional exemplars with ideophonic adverbs involve complex predications, as in hian ku o
‘strike’ vs hian ku o wóò ‘smack’.
(i) a. ó híán'
úkpàsánmì kú
ó vbí ótóí
wóò.
he PAP.strike cane
disperse CL LOC ground smack
‘He smacked his cane all over the ground.’
b. ó híán'
úkpàsánmì kú
ó vbì òtòì.
he PAP.strike cane
disperse CL LOC ground
‘He struck his cane all over the ground.’
13Although verb complement particles (Change of State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni
and Temporal Perspective lee) also appear in postverbal position, they tend to precede adverbs,
except in the case of Temporal Perspective, which precedes or follows a Place adverb. Temporal
Perspective lee co-occurs with Frequency, Place and Deixis, but never with Manner, Mannerdemonstrative or Extent.
Temporal Perspective lee precedes but does not follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis (òdè) and
Frequency (èdèdé, ìsòkpá, édèédè).
(i) a. ólí ómóhé é'
ólí émàè léé
òdè.
the man
PAP.eat the food TEMP yesterday
‘The man finished eating the food yesterday.’
b. ólí ómóhé é'
ólí émàè léé
èdèdé.
the man PAP.eat the food TEMP not.long.ago
‘The man finished eating the food moments ago.’
c. ólí ómóhé mí'tì
é ólí émàè léé
ìsòkpá.
the man PAP.able eat the food TEMP once
‘The man was able to finish eating the food at once.’
d. ólí ómóhé ó ò è émáé ísì òí léé
édèédè.
the man SC H eat food ASS his TEMP daily
‘The man finishes eating his food daily.’
The lee particle differentially interacts with verbs regarding its order relative to Place adverbs. lee
precedes or follows a Place adverb (vbí íú) with change of state verbs like ton ‘roast.’Endnotes | 345(ii) a. ò tón
émá vbí íú
mè léé.
he PRP.roast yam LOC hearth my TEMP
‘He has finished roasting yam on my hearth.’
b. ò tón
émà léé
vbí íú
mè.
he PRP.roast yam TEMP LOC hearth my
‘He has finished roasting yam on my hearth.’
With change of state verbs like gbe ‘kill,’ lee precedes the Place adverb (vbì ìwè).
(iii) ólí ómòhè gbé
ólí ófè léé
vbí ímè.
the man PRP.kill the rat TEMP LOC farm
‘The man has finished killing the rat on the farm.’
Following activity verbs, e.g. e ‘eat,’ lee only follows a Place adverb (vbì ìwè).
(iv) ólí ómòhè é
émáé vbì ìwè
léé.
the man PRP.eat food LOC house TEMP
‘The man finished eating food at the house.’
Postverbal lee does not co-occur with adverbs expressing Manner (bìbìbíbí), Extent (kóíkóí, sésésé)
or Manner-demonstrative (ìyó).
(v) a. *ò ó lá bìbìbíbí
léé.
he C run staggeringly TEMP
‘He is staggering already.’
b. *ò ó è ólí émàè kóíkóí
léé.
he C eat the food fast.paced TEMP
‘He is eating the food quickly already.’
c. *ólí ómóhé é'
ólí émàè léé
ìyó.
the man PAP.eat the food TEMP DMD
‘The man ate the food already that way.’
A form semantically and syntactically related to lee exhibits a more restricted distribution. Postverbal Temporal Degree gbe ‘too much’ precedes but does not follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis
(òdè), Frequency (ìsèvà) or Place (vbí áfúzé').
(vi) a. ólí ómóhé dá'
ényò gbé òdè.
the man PAP.drink wine much yesterday
‘The man drank too much wine yesterday.’
b. ólí ómóhé gbé'
ólí óvbèkhàn gbé ìsèvà.
the man PAP.beat the youth
much twice
‘The man beat the youth a great deal on two occasions.’
c. ólí ómòhè gbé
gbé vbí áfúzé' òdè.
the man PRP.dance much LOC Afuze yesterday
‘The man danced a great deal in Afuze yesterday.’346 | Adverbial adjunctsTemporal Degree gbe does not co-occur with adverbs of Manner, e.g. húlóhúló (*ò ó gbè húlóhúló gbé
[he C dance clumsily much] ‘He is dancing too clumsily’) or Manner-demonstrative, e.g. ìyó (*ólí
ómóhé gbé' gbé ìyó [the man PAP.dance much DMD] ‘The man danced too much that way’).
14To clarify, an alternative linear ordering of adverb types leads to ungrammaticality, as illustrated
with the aspectual extent adverb sésésé and the temporal deixis adverb òdè.(i) a. ó wéló'
ólì òtòì
á sésésé òdè.
he PAP.sweep the ground CS neatly yesterday
‘He swept up the ground neatly yesterday.’
b. *ó wéló'
ólì òtòì
á ódé
sésésé.
he PAP.sweep the ground CS yesterday neatly
‘He swept the ground yesterday neatly.’7 Noncanonical constructions
Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sentence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construction also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct constructions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.
(1) a. ólí óvbékhán nà lí ó gbé'

e. óé' ó gbé'

f. érí' ólí óvbékhán gbé'

SA the youth
PAP.break the pot CS
‘Indeed, the youth broke the pot.’
g. kí ólí óvbékhán gbé'
ólí ákhè á ò.
SN the youth
PAP.break the pot CS INT
‘It isn't the case that the youth broke the pot (contrary to your opinion).’7.1 Noun phrase focus
Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this construction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its following matrix clause conveys shared information.
Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For example, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.
(2) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ló
shèn ákhò.
the yam PF the man PRED sell tomorrow
‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló
shèn ákhò.
the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phonological shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constituent (ólí ómóhé).
(3) ólí émà ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
the yam the man PAP.sell-F
‘It was the yam that the man sold.’7.1.1 Matrix clause marking of focus relation
Focus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause position corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs.
Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix subject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus position noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374]"

Clauses in dà disjunctives co-relate with respect to inflection. Expression of negative
polarity is not limited to Perfect Negation. When Perfect Negation is in the negative

It is not only grammatical relations across clauses that require identity but also their
grammatical shapes. Thus, either lexical nouns or pronouns serve as clause subject
but not a lexical noun in one clause and a pronoun in the other. Similarly, direct
objects are constrained. Unacceptable are a lexical noun in one clause and a pronoun in the other.

"356 | Noncanonical constructions7.1.3 Matrix clause properties
Focus constructions constrain expression of mood and polarity as well as inflection,
auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding mood, focus constructions never appear as
imperatives or prohibitives. Relative to polarity, both affirmative and negative focus
constructions appear as polar questions (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.sell-F] ‘Was / Wasn’t it the yam that the man sold?’).
In their matrix clauses, affirmative focus constructions allow perfect negation
marked by ì. Negative focus constructions disallow it (ólí émá nà òkpá lí / *kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn [the yam this alone PF NF the man SC NEG sell] ‘It was this yam alone
which the man did not sell’).
Matrix clauses in focus constructions limit inflection and auxiliaries. Relative to
aspect, they inflect for Past perfect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.6
All show a subject phrase with a high tone right edge. Matrix clauses in focus constructions reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.

‘It is / isn't yam that the man sells.’
c. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ló
shèn.
the yam PF NF the man PRED sell
‘It is / isn't this yam that the man will sell.’
Focus construction matrix clauses limit deontic and epistemic modality as well
as relative tense. Of the modality forms, deontic Hortative í is never grammatical in
focus constructions. Epistemic forms are not as restricted, even if distributionally
sensitive to focus polarity. Appearing only in negative focus is Certaintive ma (ólí
émà kí / *lí ólí ómóhé má' shèn [the yam NF PF the man PAP.CER sell] ‘It wasn't the
yam that the man surely sold’), while Dubitatives only occur in positive focus polar
interrogative constructions, e.g. bia (ólí émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé bíá' shèn? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the yam that the man actually sold?’) and vba (ólí
émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé vbá' shèn? [the yam PF NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the
yam that the man really could have sold?’).
Some epistemic forms occur in affirmative and negative focus constructions:
Concessive rere (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén? [the yam PF NF the man
PAP.CONC sell] ‘Was / Wasn't it the yam that the man even sold?’) and Hypothetical
kha (ólí émá nà lí / kí ólí ómóhé khà shén [the yam this PF NF the man PAP.HYP sell]
‘It was / wasn't this yam that the man would have sold’). Concessive, though, re-Noun phrase focus | 357quires a polar interrogative structure. Remaining epistemic forms reflecting rational
judgments, Deductive za and Resultative za, fail in focus constructions.
Relative tense exponents appear in focus matrix clauses: Anterior ke (ólí émà lí /
kí ólí ómóhé ké' shèn [the yam PF NF the man PAP.ANT sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam
that the man sold afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpé' shèn
[the yam PF NF the man PAP.SUB sell] ‘It was /wasn’t the yam that the man sold
despite pending conditions’).
Focus construction matrix clauses severely limit preverb occurrence. For preverbs that occur, there is a tendency to require a nondeclarative, polar interrogative
structure in negative focus constructions.
As a class, aspectualizers interact with focus construction mood and polarity.
Matrix clauses linked to a positive focus position allow aspectualizers Repetitive che
(ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn [the yam PF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘It was the yam
that the man sold again’), Additive gbo (émà lí ólí ómóhé gbó' è [yam PF the man
PAP.ADD eat] ‘It was yam that the man ate too’) and Durative se (émà òkpá lí ólí
ómóhé sé' shèn [yam alone PF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘It was one yam that the man
still sold’). They reject Punctual ghe, regardless of polarity or mood.
Negative focus matrix clauses accept all phasal aspectualizers but Punctual ghe.
They do so provided the construction assumes a polar interrogative form: che (ólí
émà kí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn? [the yam NF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘Wasn't it the yam
that the man sold again?’), gbo (émà kí ólí ómóhé gbó' è? [yam NF the man PAP.ADD
eat] ‘Wasn't it yam that the man also ate?’) and se (émà òkpá kí ólí ómóhé sé' shèn?
[yam alone NF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘Wasn't it one yam that the man still sold?’).
Boundary aspectualizers manifest three distribution patterns. Irrespective of
construction polarity or mood, one finds Conative òó (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ó'
shèn [the yam PF NF the man SC CON sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam that the man
went to sell’).
Neither Ingressive ya nor Egressive mo occurs in focus matrix clauses. However,
their Past Absolute functions are available in positive focus: ya (ìmátó nà lí ólí
ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè [car this PF the man PAP.PA buy TP year] ‘It was this car that
the man used to buy in the year we discussed’) and mo (émá mè lí ólí ómóhé mó'
shèn [yam my PF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘It was my yam that the man at one time
sold’). With negative focus, Past Absolutes require a polar interrogative frame: ya
(ìmátó nà kí ólí ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè? [car this NF the man PAP.PA buy TP year]
‘Wasn't it this car that the man used to buy in the year we discussed?’) and mo (émá
mè kí ólí ómóhé mó' shèn? [yam my NF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘Wasn't it my yam that
the man at one time sold?’).
Of the temporal preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’), only
kpao appears in focus matrix clauses (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpá'ò shén [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.earlier sell] ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man earlier on sold’).","[381, 382, 383]"

Number agreement across focus and corresponding matrix clause position is required. A plural noun phrase (élí ímòhè) in focus position corresponds to third person plural nominative pronoun, either e or yan depending on matrix clause aspect
(Chapter 5, 5.4).

Focus position noun phrases corresponding to possessor in Associative ísì phrases
(ólì ònwìmè) require a genitive pronoun (òí) in matrix clause possessor position.
(6) ólì ònwìmè lí / kí éghó' ísì òí úé'-ì.

‘It was / wasn't the farmer whose money was lost.’
A pronoun in matrix possessor position occurs regardless of whether the possessor

(7) a. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'

Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth money ASS her take
‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’
Pronoun marking also affects first object (ólí óvbékhán) in a double object complement. When first object position corresponds to a focus position constituent, it
shows an accusative pronoun (óí).

óí úkpóràn.
the youth

‘It was / wasn't the youth whom the woman hit with a stick.’350 | Noncanonical constructionsA second marking strategy requires addition of a verb or preverb to the matrix
clause. This affects locative and manner-demonstrative adjuncts, grammatical relations not subcategorized by a verb. When a focus position noun phrase (èkìn) corresponds to a locative adjunct marked by preposition vbi, the matrix clause shows
verb za ‘be located’ in series. Not retained in focus or matrix clause position is vbi.

ólì òkpòsò.
market PF NF Oje PAP.be.loc sell the cloth APP the woman
‘It was / wasn't in the market Oje sold the cloth to the woman.’
When a focus position constituent corresponds to a manner-demonstrative adjunct
(e.g. ìyó), the matrix clause shows an obligatory Manner preverb i.
(10) ìyó
lí / kí ólí ómóhé í'
gbé ólí ófè.
DMD PF NF the man PAP.MAN kill the rat
‘It was / wasn't that way that the man killed the rat.’
A third marking strategy affects remaining grammatical relations. When a matrix monotransitive verb is morphosyntactically bare, i.e. contains no auxiliary or
preverb morpheme and no marker of imperfect or prospective aspect, direct object
position shows a zero pronoun and the verb displays Factative suffix -i.1 Adjunct
constituents like adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ do not upset this bare condition.
(11) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F
‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man sold.’
b. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén-í'
òdè.
the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F yesterday
‘It was / wasn’t the cloth that the man sold yesterday.’
An additional constraint on Factative suffixation occurs under conditions of
complex predication. Factative assignment shows four exceptions, with each exception showing a zero pronoun. The exceptions have in common the addition of morphological material to an otherwise simple predication. When their direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent, split verbs do not admit Factative -i (mi
dan ‘swallow’ in ólí ómóhé mí ùkèlè dán ‘The man swallowed a morsel’).
(12) ùkèlè lí / kí ólí ómóhé mí dán'.
morsel PF NF the man PAP.swallow
‘It was / wasn't a morsel that the man swallowed.’Noun phrase focus | 351Verbs within complex predicates showing postverbal particles (CS a, CL o, PA e or
APP li/ni, Chapter 9) do not accept Factitive -i when their direct object position corresponds to a focus constituent. Verbs like shen that take a direct object and an
indirect object (lí ólì òkpòsò) show only a zero pronoun when their direct object
position corresponds to a focus position constituent (ólí úkpùn). And verbs like gbe
that show a direct object followed by the Change of State particle a do not take Factative -i when their direct object corresponds to a focus position constituent.

b. ákhè lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'
á.
pot PF NF the man PAP.break CS
‘It was / wasn't a pot that the man broke.’
Neither verb in a serial verb construction accepts Factative -i when its direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent.
(14) ólí ókpósó lí / kí ólí ómóhé nwú'
ólí úkpùn yé.
the woman PF NF the man PAP.take the cloth move.to
‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man took the cloth to.’
Finally, verb forms that over historical time have lexicalized morphological material
(e.g. zawo < ze + ao + ghoo> [cause+face+look]) never allow Factative -i when their
direct object corresponds to a focus constituent.
(15) ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé zá'wò / *zá'wó'-ì.
the cloth PF NF the man PAP.see see-F
‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man saw.’
Matrix grammatical relations other than direct object also manifest the zero
pronoun strategy. When a focus constituent corresponds to matrix indirect object, a
zero pronoun occupies the matrix clause position. Under this condition, Applicative
li/ni designating indirect object in the matrix clause is consistently retained in its
postverbal position.
(16) ólì òkpòsò lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'
ólí úkpùn ní.
the woman PF NF the man PAP.sell the cloth APP
‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man sold the cloth to.’352 | Noncanonical constructionsA focus constituent corresponding to a temporal adjunct also reveals a corresponding matrix clause zero pronoun.

lí / kí ólí ókpósó dé'
ògèdè.
TP yesterday PF NF the woman PAP.buy plantain
‘It was / wasn't the yesterday we discussed when the woman bought plantain.’7.1.2 Focus position nominal constraints
The noun phrase position defined by affirmative and negative focus constructions
reflects few lexical constraints. Nonetheless, it restricts lexical modification and
pronominal type. Focus position marked as affirmative or negative accepts various
nominal types ranging from proper names to count and mass nouns varying in animacy. For instance, focus position accepts proper names (e.g. òlólò).
(18) òlólò lí / kí ó gbé'
ólí ófè.
Ololo PF NF he PAP.kill the rat
‘It was / wasn't Ololo who killed the rat.’
Positive and Negative Focus positions attract unmodified human (ómòhè), nonhuman animate (ófè), inanimate (úkpùn) and place (èkìn) nouns, modified or not by
the definite predeterminer.2

Focus position restricts postdeterminers in each of the classes demonstrative,
kindred, numeral and quantifier. Deictic and contrastive demonstratives modify
focus position nouns. Deictic demonstratives appear in either positive or negative
focus position: proximal nà (ólí ómóhé nà lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this PF NF he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't this man who killed the rat’) and distal áìn (ólí
ómóhé áìn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man that PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't
that man who killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never occurs
with the definite predeterminer, is found in affirmative but not negative focus constituents (ómóhé nóì lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man next PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the next man who killed the rat’).
Kindred modifiers, which never combine with the definite article, show limitations across focus polarity types. Deictic kindred élìyó appears in both affirmative
and negative focus positions (ófé élìyó lí / kí ó ó' vbì òò [rat that.kind PF NF it
PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of rat that entered the hole’). Contrastive kindred ódàn is restricted to positive focus position (ófé ódàn lí / *kí ó ó' vbì òò
[rat different.kind PF NF it PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was a different kind of rat that
entered the hole’).
Quantifier types are constrained in their distribution across affirmative and
negative focus constructions. The collective universal quantifier èrèmé, with optional definite predeterminer, appears in focus position, irrespective of focus polarity ((élí) ímóhé èrèmé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [the men all PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house]
‘It was / wasn't all the men that entered the house’). However, the distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé is never acceptable, regardless of focus polarity (*ímóhé
òdóòdé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [men each PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't each of the men that entered the house’).
Existential quantifiers, which never co-occur with the definite article, are not
distributed symmetrically across focus polarity types. Limited to positive focus constructions are partitive existential quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man certain PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was a certain man who killed the rat’) and
contrastive existential quantifier óvbèé (ómóhé óvbèé lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man an-354 | Noncanonical constructionsother PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was another man who killed the rat’). They fail
with negative focus ki.
Cardinal numerals greater than ‘one’ appear in focus position, regardless of
their co-occurrence with the definite article, e.g. èvá ‘two’ ((élí) éfè èvá lí / kí é ó' vbì
òò [the rats two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't (the) two rats who
entered the hole’). Collective numerals, which do not co-occur with the definite
article, modify nouns in positive or negative focus position, e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all two
of’ (éfè èvèvá lí / kí é ó' vbì òò [rats all.two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was /
wasn't both rats that entered the hole’). With an otherwise unmodified noun, numeral òkpá ‘one’ occurs in positive or negative focus position (ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [man one PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't one man who entered the house’). In addition, emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ modifies nouns
marked as definite in positive or negative focus position (ólí ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [the man alone PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't the man
alone who entered the house’).
Focus position noun phrases also accept nonlexical postdeterminers. Focus
noun phrases take as postnominal modifiers Associative ísì phrases (éwé ísì ólì
òkpòsò lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat ASS the woman PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was
/ wasn’t the goat of the woman that entered the house’), Relator li phrases (éwé lí
óbín' lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat R dark PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn’t
the dark goat that entered the house’) and relative clause li/ni constituents (ómóhé lí
ó dá' ólí ényò lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man R he PAP.drink the wine PF NF he PAP.kill the
rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the man who drank the wine who killed the rat’). Speaker preference is for focus constituents without definite article ólì/élì.
Pronominal forms also occupy focus position. Irrespective of construction polarity, focus position accepts personal and impersonal pronouns. However, constraints
apply that affect case as well as person and number agreement. Among personal
pronouns, only emphatic forms (e.g. ìyàìn, mèmè) appear in focus position. Emphatic personal pronouns must agree in person and number with their matrix clause
anaphoric pronoun (yan or i). Across focus polarity types, emphatic pronouns in
focus position accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’

‘It was / wasn't they alone who killed the rat.’
Focus position attracts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, numeral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Each demonstrative pronounNoun phrase focus | 355occurs in focus position: distal deictic óáìn (óáìn lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [that.one PF NF it
PAP.kill rat] ‘It was /wasn’t that one who killed a rat’), proximal ònà (ònà lí / kí ó
gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was / wasn’t this one who killed a rat’),
emphatic proximal ónánà (ónánà lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It
was / wasn’t this very one who killed a rat’), as well as contrastive demonstrative
ónóì (ónóì lí / (*kí ) ó gbé' ófè [next.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was the next one who
killed a rat’).
Both kindred pronouns occur in focus position: deictic élìyó (élìyó lí / kí ólí
ómóhé gbé'-ì [that.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of one
that the man killed’) and contrastive ódàn (ódàn lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [different.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't a different kind of one that the
man killed’).3
Focus position accepts few quantifier pronouns.4 It takes the collective universal quantifier èrèmé (èrèmé lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F]
‘It was / wasn't all that the woman killed’). Ungrammatical in focus position are the
distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé as well as both existential pronouns (ósò
and óvbèé).
Focus position accepts numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in their cardinal
form, e.g. èvá (èvá lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was
/ wasn’t two that the woman killed’) or collective form, e.g. èvèvá (èvèvá lí / kí ólí
ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all.two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn’t both that the
woman killed’). As head of a partitive vbi phrase, cardinal numerals also occur in
focus position, e.g. èvá (èvá vbì ò lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two LOC it PF NF the
woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't two of them that the woman killed’).5
Numeral pronoun ‘one’ appears in focus position, as cardinal òkpá (òkpá lí / kí
ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't one that the
woman killed’) or partitive úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbì ò lí /*kí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one LOC
it PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was one of them that the woman killed’). However, úkpòkpá only occurs in positive focus.
Focus position also accepts expressions framed as pronominally headed relative
clauses (ólí ó (*á) dé' ólí úkpùn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PF
NF it PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the one who bought the cloth who killed the

PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the dark one who killed the rat’). Pronominally
headed relatives only occur in focus position under conditions of specific reference.
Generic reference (e.g. ‘whoever’) induced by Recurrent preverb a in the relative
clause renders them unacceptable.","[374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381]"
"Noncanonical construction co-occurrence | 4137.7 Noncanonical construction co-occurrence
Constructions reflecting sentence affirmation, sentence negation, positive focus,
negative focus, topic, right dislocation and information question types are constrained in their ability to co-occur. For constructions that relate a discourse defined
position to a corresponding grammatical relation, compatibility is possible only
with distinct grammatical relations. No two constructions are compatible when
affecting the same grammatical relation.
Sentence affirmation and sentence negation establish a baseline for assessing
construction compatibility. Of the two, sentence negation is more restricted. SA érí'
and SN ki are compatible, although érí' must precede ki (*kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé' ófè
[SN SA the man PAP.kill rat] ‘It is not the case, indeed, that the man killed a rat’).
(154) érí' kí ólí ómóhé gbé'
ófè.
SA SN the man PAP.kill rat
‘Indeed, it is not the case that the man killed a rat.’
Sentence affirmation is restricted with other constructions. It appears with topicalization and RD but never with positive focus, negative focus or direct questions. As
shown below, SA and topicalization are compatible, provided the matrix clause
shows relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí ómòhè, érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man SA he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat’). Also below, SA érí' follows a topic noun phrase (*érí' ólí ómòhè, ó ké' gbé ólí ófè [SA the man he PAP.ANT

b. òjè, érí' á à ké nwù óí gbúdú.
Oje SA one H ANT take him squirming.fashion
‘As for Oje, indeed he was afterward taken squirming.’
Sentence affirmation and right dislocation are compatible. érí' precedes a matrix
clause whose subject or direct object relation corresponds to the RD constituent.
(156) a. érí' ó gbé'
ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.

‘Indeed the man killed it, that is the rat.’414 | Noncanonical constructionsWhen matrix verb takes both direct and indirect object, sentence affirmation and
right dislocation combine only when the direct object is right dislocated. érí' is unacceptable when subject or indirect object corresponds to the RD constituent.

Sentence affirmation does not precede or follow positive focus li/ni (*érí' ólí ófè
lí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [SA the rat PF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, it was the rat that the
man killed’, *ólí ómóhé lí érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man PF SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was

*ólí ófè kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [the rat NF SA the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It wasn’t the rat

[who SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Who indeed killed the rat?’, *érí' émé' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì?
[SA what the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, what did the man kill?’).
Sentence negation co-occurs with only two construction types, although in neither does SN ki occur clause initially. As indicated previously, sentence negation cooccurs with sentence affirmation provided ki follows érí'. In addition, SN combines
with topicalization. It never combines with positive focus, negative focus, right
dislocation or information questions.
Sentence negation co-occurs with topicalization as shown immediately below,
provided the topic phrase precedes ki (*kì ólí ómòhè, ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man he
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that as for the man, he killed the rat).
(158) ólí ómòhè, kí ó gbé'
ólí ófè ò.

‘As for the man, it isn't the case that he killed the rat, you know.
Sentence negation fails to combine with positive focus li/ni (*kí ólí ómóhé nà lí ó

that it was this man who killed the rat’), negative focus ki (*kí ólí ómóhé nà kí ó gbé'
ólí ófè ò [SN the man this NF he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that it
wasn’t this man who killed the rat’), right dislocation í khi (*kí ó gbé' ólí ófè, í khì ólíNoncanonical construction co-occurrence | 415ómòhè ò [SN he PAP.kill the rat ID be the man INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that he
killed the rat, that is the man’) and information questions (*kí óé' ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN
who he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case who killed the rat’).
The remaining construction types, all of which show a discourse defined position, exhibit varying degrees of compatibility. Information questions are the most
severely restricted.
Topic position combines with positive focus, negative focus and direct questions. It fails with right dislocation. No matter the other construction, the topic constituent appears in leftmost position (*ólí ómòhè lí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man PF the
rat he PAP.kill it] ‘It was the man, as for the rat, who killed it’). When topic and positive focus position co-occur, topic precedes the li/ni marked focus constituent.

b. ólí ómòhè, ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì.
the man
the rat PF it PAP.kill-F
‘As for the man, it was the rat he killed.’
A single constituent is never referenced in both topic and focus position (*ólí ófè,
íyòìn lí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he PF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it was he
who the man killed’).
When topic and negative focus both occur, topic precedes the negative focus
noun phrase, never the reverse (*ólí ómòhè kí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man NF the rat he
PAP.kill it] ‘It wasn’t the man, as for the rat, who killed it’).
(160) ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'

the rat the man NF he PAP.kill it
‘As for the rat, it wasn't the man who killed it.’
A single noun phrase is never the referent of topic and negative focus position (*ólí
ófè, íyòìn kí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he NF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it
wasn’t he who the man killed’).
When topic and information question frames co-occur, topic precedes the question word (*ébé' ólí ómòhè, ó' yé? [where the man he PAP.move.to] ‘Where, as for the
man, did he move to?’, *émé' ólí ómòhè, ó ré' híán ólí óràn? [what the man he

híán ólí óràn?

‘As for the man, what did he use to cut the wood?’
When a topic constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in an embedded Scomplement of an information question, topic precedes interrogative pronoun
(*émé' ó zé-í' ólí ómòhè, khì ò híán ólí óràn? [what it PAP.cause-F the man IND he

khì ò híán

the man what it PAP.cause-F IND he PRP.cut the wood

Topic and right dislocation are incompatible, even when each position corresponds to a distinct grammatical relation in the matrix clause (*ólí ómòhè, ò shén óì,
í khì ólí úkpùn [the man he PRP.sell it ID be the cloth] ‘As for the man, he sold it, that
is the cloth’).
Positive focus shows extremely limited compatibility with other construction
types. It co-occurs with topic, as already indicated, and right dislocation but not
with negative focus and information questions.
Positive focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of
grammatical relations constrains grammatical acceptability. When matrix grammatical subject corresponds to positive focus, matrix direct object in a monotransitive
complement can correspond to a right dislocated constituent. However, a direct
object in a monotransitive complement that corresponds to a focus position noun
phrase never co-occurs with a subject that corresponds to a constituent in RD position (*ólí úkpùn lí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the cloth PF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man]
‘It was the cloth that he sold, that is the man’, *ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the

‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’
Positive focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even when distinct
grammatical relations are affected, focus and direct question are incompatibleNoncanonical construction co-occurrence | 417(*ébé' ólí ómòhè lí ó yé'-ì? [where the man PF he PAP.move.to-F] ‘To where was it
that it was the man who moved?’, *ólí ómòhè lí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man PF where he
PAP.move.to-F] ‘It was the man who to where did he move?’).
Negative focus also shows limited co-occurrence with other construction types.
It appears with topic, as already seen, and right dislocation, but not with positive
focus or direct questions. Negative focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of grammatical relations in the matrix clause limits combinations.
Subject corresponds to a constituent in negative focus position when a direct object
corresponds to right dislocated position.

b. ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'
óì, í khì ólí ófè.
the man NF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’
But a direct object that corresponds to negative focus position never co-occurs with
a subject that corresponds to right dislocated position (*ólí úkpùn kí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí
ómòhè [the cloth NF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man] ‘It wasn’t the cloth that he sold,
that is the man’, *ólí ófè kí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the rat NF he PAP.kill-F ID be the
man] ‘It wasn’t the rat that he killed, that is the man’).
Negative focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even with distinct
grammatical relations affected, NF and questions are incompatible (*ébé' ólí ómòhè
kí ó yé'-ì? [where the man NF he PAP.move.to-F] ‘Where if it wasn’t the man did he
go to?’, *ólí ómòhè kí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man NF where he PAP.move.to-F] ‘It wasn’t
the man so where did he move to?’).
As indicated previously, right dislocation co-occurs with positive focus, negative focus and with information questions. It never combines with topicalization. RD
and information questions are compatible provided distinct matrix relations are
involved. Moreover, crossover of subject to right dislocated position and direct object to question position is acceptable.
(165) émé' ó shén'-ì,
í khì ólí ómòhè?
what he PAP.sell-F ID be the man
‘What did he sell, that is the man?’
In addition, the constraint limiting RD to subject or direct object does not apply
under a question condition. Indirect objects marked by Applicative li/ni appear in
RD position with question words corresponding to subject or direct object.","[438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
"Cultural and Linguistic Background
Emai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilometers on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, OjavunNew-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the related Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for committing murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyaibi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-OldSite. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent OraPreface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list supporting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader classificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, BendorSamuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is extremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encompassing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished dissertation “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonology and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic grammatical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant language of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An extensive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papersx | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Egbokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home language in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.","[8, 9, 10]"

A disjunctive relation between events is framed by dà ‘or.’ It requires a polarity contrast, even more stringent than àmáà. In addition to an affirmative~negative contrast across clauses, disjunctive dà requires identity of verb and interrogative mood.
Disjunctives in declarative form or with contrasting verbs (e.g. de ‘buy’ and so ‘sew’)
are unacceptable.","[978, 979, 980]"
"7.6.2 Negation ki
Sentence negation (SN) constructions are framed by clause initial ki. They negate an
entire proposition, specifying that it is not shared by speaker and hearer as true. The
construction takes the form of a polar interrogative or a declarative with an obligatory contrary-to-expectation interjection ò. Consequently, ki either queries the proposition expressed in the interrogative with an assumption of doubt or contravenes
the interjection framed declarative structure.

of auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding preverbs, SN imposes severe restrictions. It
rejects all preverbs: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attributive, quantity
and manner-demonstrative. SN ki constructions partially limit aspect. They inflect
for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective. Thus they disallow
Present perfect, Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.

In ki matrix clauses modality auxiliaries are restricted absolutely. One finds neither deontic (Hortative í) nor epistemic (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba and bia,

illustrates (*kí ólí ómóhé khà gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.HYP kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case

SN ki clauses completely reject relative tense ke and kpe, as ke shows (*kí ólí

In SN subject position kindred forms are partially restricted. Deictic élìyó is
grammatical but contrastive sortal ódàn is not (kí úkpún élìyó / *ódàn ó ò ghàén ò
[SN cloth that.kind different.kind SC H costly INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that
kind of cloth is costly’).
SN subjects admit only one quantifier, collective universal èrèmé. It occurs, although not with the definite article (kí (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goats all
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that all the goats entered the
house’). No other quantifier (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò
or contrastive existential óvbèé) occupies SN subject position as modifier.
Subject phrases in ki matrix clauses allow most numeral modifiers. One finds
collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’ (kí íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn ò? [SN cloths all.ten
PAP.burn CS LOC the fire INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case that all ten cloths burned up in

house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the man alone entered the house’).
ki subjects accept postnominal modifier phrases. Among the latter are expressions with Associative ísì (kí (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat ASS the
woman PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman's goat

R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It isn't the case that the man who
drank the wine killed the rat, although you may have thought so’). In elicited constructions, there is a preference for definite article inclusion.
Subject position in ki constructions imposes greater restrictions on impersonal
pronouns than personal pronouns. It allows subject pronouns for each person and
number.","[434, 435, 436]"

Factuality verbs express fact-based information as related to the knowledge state of
their grammatical subject. They include mie ‘find out,’ oo ‘suppose,’ ga ze ‘discover,’
de ‘discover’ and vbohie ‘dream.’ None manifests a ditransitive form. Moreover, mie
and oo are limited to first person subjects. vbohie figures in complex predicates with
mie to modulate situational aspect of complement content. Factuality verbs are
limited to khi marked S-complements. They reject those marked by li, si or IQ. Further, factuality verbs limit aspect to the perfect and, except for polar interrogatives,
tend to restrict polarity and mood expression. Complement types with factuality
verbs are embedded as direct objects. None but that of mie corresponds to an interrogative pronoun and none corresponds to manner demonstrative pronoun ìyó ‘so.’
Overwhelmingly, factuality verbs constrain subject identity across complement and
matrix clauses by rejecting logophoric pronouns. Additional properties emerge from
consideration of each verb and its S-complements.","[871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876]"

Past perfect (PAP) specifies a distal or nonimmediate past relation between event
time and utterance time. It carries no implication of present relevance, appearing
instead to ascribe definite or emphatic character to a past event. In monotransitive
constructions inflected for PAP, verb tone is high downstep and subject phrase tone
is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge high on a lexically headed constituent

Past and Present perfect show contrasting temporal adverbs. Past perfect takes òdè
‘yesterday,’ while Present perfect accepts èghéènà ‘just recently.’ Reversal of alignment between adverbs and perfect type is ungrammatical.

Imperfect aspect views an event as incomplete relative to moment of utterance
or reference time. For Continuous, some temporal portion of an event is coincident
with moment of utterance. This is not necessarily the case for Habitual, where an
event is not indexed to a specific point on the time line. Each imperfect is designated
by a tonal pattern affecting subject phrase and verb phrase. In monotransitive structures, verb tone is low but subject phrase tone varies according to imperfect type.
Continuous aspect specifies the ongoing character of an event relative to moment of utterance or reference time. In monotransitive clauses with third person
subjects, Continuous is expressed by high tone ó, verb tone is low (è) and subject102 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsphrase exhibits a low tone pronoun (ò) or low tone subject concord (ò) following a

the man
the man this SC C eat the food
‘The man / This man is eating food.’
Habitual denotes the timeless character of an event, delinking it from time axis
points. In monotransitive clauses with third person subjects, Habitual is low tone ò,
verb tone is low (shèn) and subject phrase shows a high tone pronoun (ó) or subject
concord with high tone (ó) following a lexical constituent with right edge high (ólí
ómóhé, élí ímóhé ná).

‘He sells cloth.’
b. ólí ómóhé / élí ímóhé ná
ó ò shèn úkpùn.
the man
the men these SC H sell cloth
‘The man sells / These men sell cloth.’
Imperfect Continuous and Habitual adopt adverbs with distinct temporal dimensions. Continuous allows adverbial ènyáà ‘just now,’ whereas Habitual accepts adverbials of frequency (sàá ‘always’) or indefinite past (éghèéghè ‘generations ago’).
Reversing this assignment is ungrammatical.

Habitual expresses generic statements.

vis-à-vis its subject noun phrase. Concord form is constant across lexical subjects

Prospective aspect, while specifying event nonoccurrence, recognizes a future
event with two degrees of remoteness: proximal and distal. It is expressed by high
tone ló and contrasting tonal patterns on the subject.
Predictive ló ‘will’ allows the speaker to claim that a future event will occur at a
point distal to reference time. In bare monotransitives inflected for Predictive, verb
tone is low (è) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or right edge
high for a lexically headed constituent (ólí ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná).

Anticipative ló reflects a speaker claim that an event will occur at a future point
proximal to reference time. It translates ‘about to.’ In bare monotransitives, verb
tone is low (è) and subject tone is low on a pronoun (ò) or right edge low for a lexical
constituent (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).

Negative inflection is expressed by three mutually exclusive forms: Perfect ì, Prospective khà and Past Absolute yà. Each occurs with a subject pronoun or subject
concord í and a lexically headed subject phrase.
Perfect Negation (NEG) is expressed by low tone ì. In third person monotransitive clauses, verb tone is low (è), and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or subject concord high í follows a lexically headed constituent with right
edge low tone (ólí ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).

project to a point subsequent to time of utterance. It translates ‘will not’ and reliesInflectional and auxiliary categories | 105on low tone khà, which also expresses epistemic Hypothetical.1 In third person

Also removed from time of utterance is Past Absolute Negation (PANEG). It is signaled by low tone yà ‘never.’2 In third person monotransitives, verb tone is low
(shèn) and subject phrase tone is either high on a pronoun (ó) or high tone subject
concord í follows a lexically headed constituent with right edge low tone (ólí
ómòhè, ólí ómóhé nà).

Negation of affirmative imperative commands is expressed by Prohibition constructions. The Prohibitive (PR) morpheme è exhibits low tone. It requires a second
person subject pronoun, either singular form é or plural vbá, both showing high
tone. In bare monotransitives, verb tone (é) is high.

Emai deontic and epistemic forms exhibit contrasting distribution and tonal patterns. There is one deontic form and six epistemic forms. Within and across modality types, auxiliaries combine. Deontic Hortative use assumes that an obligation
relation exists between grammatical subject and clausal event. Showing high tone í,
it induces left edge low tone of the immediately following constitutent. Epistemic
auxiliaries convey speaker judgment about degree of probability or certainty of
proposition truth value (Palmer 2001). Three judgment types occur: rational (Deductive za, Resultative za), speculative (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba, Dubitative bia)
and assumptive (Concessive rere/re, Hypothetical kha). Epistemic forms fail to induce left edge low tone in a following constituent.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"Preverb categories | 151zeze partially restricts relative tense. It follows Anterior ke and then only in
noncanonical shapes like polar interrogatives: ólí ómòhè kéè zèzè é ólí émàè? [the
man PRP.ANT NABI eat the food] ‘Did the man eat a bit of the food anymore?’.
Both intensifier preverbs partially restrict polarity and sentence mood. Absolute
Intensifier zemi is limited to affirmative declaratives. It fails in imperatives, prohibitives, negatives and polar questions. Unacceptable Perfect negation with zemi supports this restriction: *ólí ómòhè í ì zèmí è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG ABSI eat the

Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze, while not appearing in imperatives or prohibitives, is found in negative statements (ólí ómòhè í ì zèzé è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG

6Focus constructions that correspond to canonical generic Habituals (ívbékhán ó ò tò vbí ófè [youths
SC H fond.of LOC rat] ‘Youths are fond of rats’) are ungrammatical. A focus position constituent
never corresponds to a grammatical relation in a generic Habitual structure.

7Nonetheless, the distribution of Emphatic Reflexive varies more than any other preverb in focus
constructions. When the focus constituent corresponds to matrix subject, Emphatic Reflexive dobo
with its following pronoun shows either of two positions. It can occupy a preverb position in either
positive or negative focus constructions (ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó dóbó' óì é ólí émà [the man PF NF he
PAP.REFL him eat the yam] ‘It was / wasn't the man who by himself ate the yam’).
Emphatic Reflexive dobo also occurs within a focus constituent, although only in positive focus
(ólí ómòhè dòbó óì lí / *kí ó é' ólí émà [the man REFL him PF NF he PAP.eat the yam] ‘It was / *wasn’t
the man himself who ate the yam’).
When a grammatical relation other than subject, direct object for instance, corresponds to a focus
constituent, Emphatic Reflexive dobo in preverb position never appears (*ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé
dóbó' óì é [the yam PF NF the man PAP.REFL him eat] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam that the man himself
ate’).
8One might suspect that pragmatic construal would not be a problem with other verbs that in English take complex complements, for example steal. However, the equivalent Emai predicate do nwu,
is expressed with a two verb complex predicate that takes only a direct object complement (Chapter
11, 11.11).","[444, 445]"
"‘be’ forms | 433CMB constructions rarely exhibit a canonical simple active, affirmative frame.
Instead, they show either Perfect Negation preceding copula vbi or a class noun in a
discourse defined position such as focus (marked by li/ni) followed by the assigned
nominal and copula u.
(26) a. ólí ómòhè í ì
vbì óì.
the man SC NEG be thief
‘The man is not a thief.’
b. óì

thief PF the man PAP.be
‘It is a thief that the man is.’
Despite their class membership function, CMB constructions never frame taxonomic
statements in which one referent is ranked relative to another using a specific to
general scale, respectively.
(27) *èkpèn / ólì èkpèn
vbì éàmì.
leopard the leopard be animal
‘A / The leopard is an animal.’
As previously indicated, CMB constructions limit polarity and mood. Negative
polarity is the norm. Under extremely rich contextual conditions but never at the
onset of a discourse, affirmative CMB constructions occur. When they do, vbi tone is
obligatorily low.
(28) ólí ómòhè vbì óì.
the man be thief
‘The man is a thief.’
CMB constructions partially limit mood expression. They appear as polar questions with Perfect Negation (ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óì? [the man SC NEG be thief] ‘Isn't the
man a thief?’) and focus (óì lí ólí ómóhé ù? [thief PF the man be] ‘Is it a thief that the
man is?’). CMB does not occur as an imperative or prohibitive.
CMB accepts few forms prototypically associated with Emai verb phrases. It limits verbal affixes, inflection, auxiliaries, preverbs, post-verbal particles and temporal deictic adjuncts. Although CMB prefers negation, it does not inflect for perfect,
imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, it rejects verbal affixes, such as Distributive lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè í ì vbì-lò óì [the men SC NEG be-DS thief] ‘Each of the men is
not a thief’).
Similarly, CMB frames restrict auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow modality,
both deontic (Hortative í) and epistemic (Certaintive ma), as well as relative tense,434 | Be, do, happen and haveAnterior ke in (*ólí ómòhè í ì í / má / ké vbì óì [the man SC NEG HOR CER ANT be
thief] ‘The man should not be/ is surely not / is not since then a thief’). Under special usage conditions involving fixed metaphor, the vbi copula occurs with Anterior
relative tense ke (áwé ísì òí í ì ké vbì égbé ísì òí [legs ASS her SC NEG ANT be body
ASS her] ‘Her legs do not feel part of her body anymore’).
CMB constructions allow only one preverb. They accept evaluative preverb kuku
(ólí úkpùn í ì kùkú vbì ísì òjè [the cloth SC NEG POEV be ASS Oje] ‘Afterall, the cloth is
not Oje's’). Remaining preverb classes are rejected, namely aspectualizer (Additive
gbo), subject attributive (totóbo), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó) and
quantity (gba): (*élí ímòhè í ì gbó / tòtóbó / kpàó / ìyó / gbá vbì óì [the men SC NEG
ADD / intensely /initially / DMD /COL be thief] ‘The men are not also / intensely /
initially / that way / together thieves’).
CMB also restricts postverbal temporal particles and adverbs. It rejects Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí lèé / gbè [the
man SC NEG be thief TEMP / much] ‘The man is not a thief already / too much of a
thief’). It disallows deictic adjuncts, e.g. èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí
èghéènà [the man SC NEG be thief recently] ‘The man was not a thief recently’).
Noun phrase positions in CBM constructions are restricted by NP type and definiteness but not animacy or number. Assigned nominals preceding the CMB copula
allow all NP types and all definiteness values. The class nominal following vbi/u
accepts only common nouns and only referential indefinites. Across assigned nominal and class nominal positions, number agreement is obligatory (ólí ómòhè and
ònwìmè, élí ímòhè and ìnwìmè).

b. élí ímòhè / *ólí ómòhè í ì

(31) ó ì
vbì émóí mè / *èmòì.

vbì òlólò / ò / óì.
the oraclist SC NEG be Ololo he him
‘The oraclist is not Ololo / he / him.’
Class nominal position constrains definiteness expression. Common nouns with
definite article ólí/élí are unacceptable (ónóì í ì vbì ómò / *ólí ómò [next.one SC NEG
be child the child] ‘The next one is not a useless child’), as are attributive phrase
descriptions marked by the same modifier (*ólí ékpé' í ì vbì ólí óbín' [the hawk SC
NEG be the dark.one] ‘The hawk is not the dark one’).
Class position with vbi/u disallows the entire range of postdeterminers. Unacceptable modifiers in class position include kindred élìyó and demonstrative nóì
(*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá élìyó / nóì [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass that.kind / next]
‘The heavy one is not that kind of cutlass’), universal quantifier èrèmé and cardinal
numeral èvá (*élì òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá èrèmé / èvá [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass all

heavy one is not some cutlass’).
However, CMB class position takes common nouns modified by Associative ísì
phrases. It does so provided there is no definite article (ólì òkhùà í ì vbì ópíá ísì òjè
/*ólí ópíá ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass ASS Oje the cutlass ASS Oje] ‘The
heavy one is not Oje's cutlass’). It also accepts headless associative phrases (ólì
òkhùà í ì vbì ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The heavy one is not Oje's’).
CMB class position accepts few impersonal pronouns. It allows the numeral
pronoun úkpòkpá ‘one’ as head of a partitive vbi phrase whose complement is a
pronominally headed relative clause. A numeral pronoun greater than one (e.g. èvá)
as head of a partitive phrase is unacceptable (*élí ópíá nà í ì vbì èvá vbí élí á ló shènnò [the cutlass these SC NEG be two LOC ones one PRED sell-DS] ‘These cutlasses are436 | Be, do, happen and havenot two of the ones that will be sold’). All other impersonal pronouns are rejected:

the cutlass this SC NEG be one

‘This cutlass is not one of the ones that will be sold.’
Assigned position preceding the CMB copula exhibits contrasting values as to
NP type and definiteness but not animacy. Regarding NP type, it accepts proper
names (òlólò) and subject position pronouns (má, yán) but not the indefinite subject
pronoun (a).

Assigned position in vbi/u constructions accepts common nouns regardless of
animacy. They must, however, be syntactically elaborated.7 Assigned position permits human (òkpòsò), nonhuman animate (áwá) and inanimate (ópìà) nouns, provided each is elaborated by, for example, definite article ólì.

Abstract common nouns in CMB assigned position are not limited in the same way.

predeterminer. Common nouns occur in assigned position when modified only by a
collective numeral, e.g. èvèvá in (ímóhé èvèvá í ì vbì ìnwìmè [men both SC NEG be
farmers] ‘Both men are not farmers’). Assigned position common nouns do not require the definite article when modified by Associative ísì (ólí áwà / áwá ísì òjè í ì vbì
áànmì [the dog dog ASS Oje SC NEG be female] ‘The dog of Oje / Oje’s dog is not

[the cutlass cutlass R the man take propel CS SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The / A cutlass
that the man threw away was not Oje's’).
Other modifiers that affect referent construal appear in assigned position. These
include postdeterminer demonstratives nà and nóì (ólí ópíá nà / ópíá nóì í ì vbì ólí á
ré' gbé ólí éwè [the cutlass this cutlass next SC NEG be one one use kill the goat]
‘This cutlass / The next cutlass is not the one used to kill the goat’).
More constrained in assigned position are cardinal numerals and quantifier
postdeterminers. Cardinal numerals require the definite predeterminer (élí ópìà èvá
/ *ópìà èvá í ì vbì ísì òjè [the cutlass two cutlass two SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The two
cutlasses are not Oje's’) or a complement consisting of a partitive vbi phrase (ópìà
èvá vbì ò í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass two LOC it SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Two cutlasses from
them were not Oje's’).
Assigned position rejects quantifier and kindred forms. Excluded are existential
quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*ópíá ósò / óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass some other SC NEG
be ASS Oje] ‘Some / Another cutlass is not Oje’s’) and kindred élìyó (*ópíá élìyó í ì vbì
ísì òjè [cutlass that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘A cutlass of that kind is not Oje's’).
Impersonal pronouns in assigned position are partially restricted. Acceptable
are demonstrative ònà and ónóì (ònà / ónóì í ì vbì ísì èé [this.one next.one SC NEG be
ASS your] ‘This one / the next one is not yours’) as well as plural existential ésò (ésò
í ì vbì ísì èmé [some.ones SC NEG be ASS my] ‘None are mine’).
In assigned position, numeral pronouns reveal a mixed distribution. Collective
numeral pronouns (èvèvá) are acceptable (èvèvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [all.two SC NEG be
ASS my] ‘Both are not mine’), whereas cardinal numeral pronouns (èvá, òkpá) require a following partitive vbi phrase (èvá vbí élì ògèdè / *èvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [two LOC
the banana two SC NEG be ASS my] ‘Two of the bananas are not mine’). Morphological reformulation is also required for òkpá ‘one,’ e.g. úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló
shèn í ì vbì ísì òjè [one LOC ones one PRED sell SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘One of those that
will be sold is not Oje’s’).
Nonetheless, assigned position reveals the unacceptability of remaining pronouns. Kindred forms fail, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn (*élìyó í ì vbì ísì òjè
[that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘That kind of one is not Oje’s’), as does the contrastive
existential pronoun óvbèé (*óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [other.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Another one is not Oje’s’).","[458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463]"
"100 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsSegmental forms in the categories of inflection, auxiliary and preverb exhibit
fixed or variable tone. Most auxiliary and preverb categories are assigned tone values by inflection. They thus show variable high, low or contour tone relative to the
fixed tone of inflectional elements conveying affirmative and negative aspect. Exceptions to this general rule are irrealis forms such as Hortative, Hypothetical and
the Conative preverb, which reveal a fixed tone. Across the categories aspect, modality, relative tense and preverb, tone value and morpheme sense interrelate. Some
segmental forms exhibit alternating tonal values (high and low) that co-vary with
alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. Each tone-form combination denotes
a distinct grammatical function. Other segmental forms show a single tone that
combines with alternating tonal values of the subject phrase. In this case, too, each
tone-form combination designates a distinct grammatical function. And still other
segmental forms manifest a single tone, combine with a single subject phrase tone,
and designate a single grammatical function.
Two tone patterns characterize subject phrase exponents. One appears on a
pronoun that shows either a low tone (ò ‘he, she, it’) or high tone (ó ‘he, she, it’). A
second appears on a lexically specified noun phrase with a right edge low tone (òjè
‘Oje,’ ólí ómòhè ‘the man,’ ólí ómóhé nà ‘this man’) or a right edge high tone (ójé, ólí
ómóhé, ólí ómóhé ná). Right edge tone on grammatical subject affects expression of
inflection as well as auxiliary, relative tense and preverbs.","[125, 126]"
"458 | Be, do, happen and havePAR subject position partially restricts impersonal pronouns.16 It allows pronouns for deictic demonstrative ònà and óáìn (ònà / óáìn ríì vbì ò [this.one that.one

rì vbì ò [two PAP.be LOC them] ‘Two are among them’), partitive existential quantifier ósò (ósò ríì vbì ò [certain.one PRP.be LOC them] ‘A certain one is among them’)
and deictic kindred élìyó (élìyó rì vbì ò [that.kind.one PAP.be LOC them] ‘That kind is
among them’). PAR subject disallows contrastive kindred (ódàn), contrastive existential (óvbèé), universal quantifier (èrèmé, òdóòdé) and collective numerals (e.g.
èvèvá).
Noun phrase positions in PAR constructions respond asymmetrically to repositioning in discourse. ri and e constructions behave dissimilarly as well. With ri, PAR
subject corresponds to a constituent designated as positive focus li/ni, negative
focus ki, or topic. PAR subject fails to correspond to an interrogative pronoun. In e
constructions, PAR subject never corresponds to a constituent in focus, topic or
question word position. Similarly restricted are vbi complements, which fail to correspond to any discourse position: focus, topic or question word.

Emai is a terraced-level tone language showing high, low, and down-stepped high.
For some word classes, inherent tone values distinguish words that in all other aspects of sound shape are identical. Nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs in
citation form express lexical meanings through tonal contrasts. Citation forms of
verbs, auxiliaries, and adverbial preverbs generally exhibit no tonal contrast, as
with other Edoid languages (Elugbe 1989). Emai verbs, auxiliaries, and preverbs are
assigned tone values reflecting grammatical properties of their constructions. In
large part these values correlate with the categories indicative and subjunctive
mood. More specifically, major patterns of tonal contrast derive from aspect (perfect, imperfect and prospective), modality (deontic and epistemic) and sentence
complement type.
For Emai words composed of identical segments, predominantly nouns and adverbs, tone values play a distinguishing role. Emai's high (H), down-stepped high
(!H) and low (L) tones combine in various ways within otherwise identical lexical
nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs. In orthographic practice, high tone isSyllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 5represented by an acute accent, low tone by a grave accent, and down-stepped high
by an acute accent immediately followed by a single quote. The last of these tones is
one pitch step lower than an immediately preceding high tone.

Major word classes tend to reflect contrasting syllable structures, although no absolute relation exists between category type and syllable character. All parts of speech
are vowel final. Nouns are uniformly vowel-initial. Verbs tend to be consonant initial, with a few being vowel initial. Adjectives are usually consonant initial, whereas
adverbs are either vowel- or consonant initial. Of the minor categories, some are
predominantly consonant initial with a few vowel initial forms (preverbs, postverbal
particles, complements). Other minor categories are vowel initial (determiners) with
a few consonant initial forms (intensifiers). The preposition class is consonant initial. Concord expression is vowel only with fixed tone patterns.
In pronunciation, the syllabic character of word classes in phrasal or clausal
constructions is normally adjusted by one or another phonological process: vowel6 | Orthography and grammatical overviewelision or glide formation. These processes lead to a divergence between the orthographic practice of employing citation forms and normal-rate pronunciation rendered phonetically. Regardless of phonetic transformation through glide formation
or vowel elision, orthographic practice retains vowel segments in all word classes.
Glide formation affects the close vowels [i] and [u] when they precede non-close
vowels within a lexical or syntactic constituent. These vowels alternate with the
glides [y] and [w], respectively, as illustrated by the verbs fi and ku when followed
by a noun phrase.
fí
ópìà [fyópìà]
throw cutlasskú
àmè [kwàmè]
throw waterUnder specific grammatical conditions, the vowel elision process omits a morpheme-final vowel. Elision differentially affects word classes, revealing complex
interactions between phonological and syntactic parameters. Vowel elision application is restricted across major syntactic constituents like subject/predicate and predicate/adverb. In normal pronunciation of the sentence below, neither the final vowel of the subject noun ókpósó ‘woman’ nor the initial vowel of the verb éhén
‘prepare’ elide. Similarly, neither the final vowel of the direct object ákhé ‘pot’ nor
the initial vowel of the adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ elide. However, the final vowel of the
predeterminer ólì ‘the’ elides, as does the final vowel of the verb éhén.
ólí ókpósó éhén'
ákhé òdè. [ólókpósó éhán'khé òdè]
the woman PAP.prepare pot yesterday
‘The woman prepared a pot yesterday.’
Vowels juxtaposed due to discourse repositioning of constituents are not elided. The
final vowel of noun áwà ‘dog,’ when in clause-initial topic position, is not omitted
relative to the initial vowel of following élì ‘the.’
ólí áwà, élí ímòhè khú
óì. [óláwà élímòhè khú óì]
the dog the men PRP.chase it
‘As for the dog, the men chased it.’
Vowel elision in pronunciation reflects three phonetic patterns that become
transparent most easily with transitive verb phrases. When a lexical direct object
immediately follows a consonant initial verb with a single vowel, the final vowel of
the verb is omitted, while the initial vowel of the direct object is retained. Orthographic representation shows both vowels nonetheless, as shown by comparing
orthographic representations to square bracketed broad phonetic representations.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"
"8.1.5.2 Partitive ri / e
A Partitive (PAR) function distinct from EXT and LCT is expressed by predicates ri
and e: NP ri vbi o and NP e vbi o. Its construction consists of an initial noun phrase,
either of the verbs ri or e, and a vbi complement consisting of the nondeictic locative
pronoun. PAR asserts a partitive relation between a subject referent and an assumed456 | Be, do, happen and haveplurality indexed by nondeictic locative pronoun ò. Canonical PAR constructions
restrict their grammatical shape in the fashion of Existential constructions.
PAR constructions exhibit few properties normally associated with verbs. ri inflects for aspect with an irregular tone pattern and fails to allow auxiliaries and
preverbs. Regarding aspect, PAR ri permits Present perfect (right edge low tone
subject and a high low verb tone). In typical verb phrases, high low tone occurs on
auxiliaries and preverbs, not verbs. Morever, PAR ri fails to inflect for imperfect or
prospective aspect.

the man PRED be LOC them
‘The man will be among them.’
b. *ólí ómóhé ó ò è vbì ò.

PAR constructions, regardless of ri or e as predicate, do not accept any auxiliaries or preverbs, as suggested by unacceptable epistemic Certaintive ma, relative

others (*ólí ómóhé má' / kpé' / ché' / kú'kù rì vbì ò [the man PAP.CER SUB REP EVAL
be LOC them] ‘The man surely / yet / again / after all was among them’).
In PAR constructions polarity and mood are limited. ri constructions occur as
polar interrogatives (ólí ómòhè ríì vbì ò? [the man PRP.be LOC them] ‘Is the man
among them?’) but never as negatives (*ólí ómòhè í ì rì vbì ò [the man SC NEG be LOC

(èrèmé, òdóòdè).

The Specifier copula (SPE) construction identifies a referent for a hearer. It exhibits
a rather rigid syntax. SPE constructions consist of Specifier copula o preceded by a
noun phrase in a focus position that is either overtly marked by negative focus ki or
covertly marked for positive focus. SPE rejects overt marking of positive focus by
li/ni. In its canonical shape, the Specifier copula shows a high low tone.
(17) óì

thief NF be

‘It’s a thief.’SPE constructions show no grammatical subject. Nominative pronouns are not
allowed either in place of initial high tone, as one might expect if the initial high
tone o were the third person nominative pronoun (*ólí ómòhè ó ò [the man he be]430 | Be, do, happen and have‘He is a man’), or in construction with high low tone of copula óò (*ólí ómòhè í / ú óò
[the man I you be] ‘I am / you are the man’).
SPE frames exhibit few grammatical properties typically associated with verb
constructions. óò does not inflect for aspect, at least in the usual Emai fashion. Although the bare SPE copula shows high low tone, it disallows aspect marking as
perfect (neither Past nor Present), imperfect (neither Continuous nor Habitual) or
prospective (neither Predictive nor Anticipative).
Constructions with óò restrict verbal affixes, auxiliaries, preverbs, postverbal
particles and temporal deictic adverbs. Relative to verbal affixes, SPE is incompatible with Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i.
SPE copula tone is uniformly low when preceded by a modal auxiliary. And SPE
is never compatible with a subject pronoun (ó ) preceding an auxiliary.
(18) íkhúnmí ékpà má ò.
medicine vomit CER be
‘It is vomit medicine.’/*íkhúnmí ékpà ó má' ò.
medicine vomit it CER beSPE constructions restrict auxiliaries, except for epistemic forms, and preverbs.
Relative tense ke and kpe are unacceptable as is deontic Hortative í. SPE allows
epistemic Certaintive ma, as shown above, Dubitative vba (óì vbá ò? [thief DUB be]
‘Could it really be a thief?’) and bia (íkhúnmí ékpà bíá ò? [medicine vomit DUB be]
‘Was it actually vomit medicine?’), and Concessive rere (óì rérè ó? [thief CONC be]
‘So it was even a thief?’). Of these, only Certaintive does not require a polar question. SPE disallows Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical kha.
Specifier copula constructions limit preverbs absolutely. They reject aspectualizer gbo, evaluative kuku, temporal kpao and manner-demonstrative ìyó as representatives of their category (*óì gbó / kúkù / kpáò / ìyó ò [thief ADD POEV initially
DMD be] ‘It’s also / after all / firstly / so a thief’). In addition, they reject subject
attributive and quantity preverbs
SPE similarly constrains post-verbal complement particles and adverbials. It
disallows Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*óì óò léé / gbé [thief
be TEMP much] ‘He’s already too much a thief’). It also prohibits temporal deictic
adverbs such as éénà ‘today’ (*óì óò éènà [thief be today] ‘It’s a thief today’).
SPE óò constructions severely limit polarity and mood. They show an interrogative form with high high tone on the copula (óì óó? [thief be] ‘Is it a thief?’, óì kí óó?
[thief NF be] ‘Isn't it a thief?’). However, óò constructions do not assume an imperative, prohibitive or negative statement shape.
Specifier óò partially restricts its initial noun phrase position, i.e focus, as to NP
type, animacy and definiteness.4 For NP type, Specifier focus requires an emphatic
pronoun, irrespective of person or number. It rejects nonemphatic nominative pronouns (i, u) or the indefinite subject pronoun (a).","[454, 455, 456]"
"7.2 Predicate focus
Predicate focus constructions exhibit a focus constituent with a nominalized verb
followed by a matrix clause. In focus position, they employ the matrix clause verb’s
gerundive form (uVERBmi) (Chapter 2, 2.3.2). Regardless of positive or negative focus, these constructions are highly constrained and very infrequently used. More so
than nominal focus, predicate focus constructions severely constrain modifiers in
focus position as well as auxiliaries and preverbs in their matrix clause.
Positive and negative focus particles differentially constrain focus position gerundive constituents. With unmodified gerundive nominals in focus position, the
positive focus particle itself is optional.
(25) úkhùmí (lí) òhí khú'
ólí éwè.
chasing PF Ohi PAP.chase the goat
‘Chasing is what Ohi did to the goat.’
The negative focus particle never appears with an unmodified gerundive in focus
position. It only occurs with gerundives that are modified.

ólí éwè.
chasing R small chasing NF Ohi PAP.chase the goat
‘It was not a little chasing that Ohi did to the goat.’
Gerundive nominals in focus position limit postdeterminers. Gerundive údàmí ‘being tall’ derived from stative da ‘be tall’ allows contrastive kindred ódàn ‘different
kind’ as well as unmarked attributive phrases, e.g. óbè ‘bad.’ údàmí never accepts
deictic kindred, demonstratives, numerals or quantifiers.",[385]

polar questions (ólí ómóhé ó ò è émáé édèédè? [the man SC H eat food daily] ‘Does

Indefinite frequency adverbs do not allow any functions associated with aspectualizers ya (*ólí ómóhé yà é émáé édèédè [the man PAP.PA eat food daily] ‘The man
used to eat food daily’) and mo (*ólí ómóhé mó' é émáé édèédè [the man PAP.PA eat
food daily] ‘The man at one time ate food daily’).
Adverbs in the indefinite frequency subclass show limited repositioning in discourse. All but sàá occupy focus position, although éghèéghè requires that its matrix

Temporal extent adverbs specify the temporal length of an event relative to event
onset. Morphologically, some extent adverbs exhibit triplication: títítí ‘a long time,’
and kékéké ‘continuously;’ others do not, e.g. wèéé ‘short time.’ Temporal extent
adverbs correspond to the question frame ébé' ~ ébí'...i... tee se ‘how long.’

Present perfect as well as imperfect and prospective aspect.

A distinct temporal extent adverb is kékéké ‘continuously.’ It tends to occur with

Adverbs specifying event rate do not correspond to any direct question frame. Many
exemplars of this class show morphological reduplication or triplication. They serve
as adverbs by virtue of their syntactic position and inducement of high tone spread
in a preceding constituent.
A typical temporal rate adverb is tóítóí ‘quickly.’ It severely restricts aspect, polarity, mood and discourse respositioning. tóítóí occurs only in statements marked
by the Hortative auxiliary. It rejects clauses inflected for perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.
(78) ólí ómòhè í
vàré tóítóí.
the man HOR come quickly
‘The man should come quickly.’Overview of temporal adverbials | 319Temporal tóítóí has no corresponding direct question, such as ébé'/ébí' …i ‘how.’

Concerning polarity and mood, temporal rate tóítóí appears in imperative constructions (vàré tóítóí [come quickly] ‘Come quickly’) but not prohibitives, negative
statements, or polar questions.
Discourse repositioning of tóítóí is severely restricted. It fails in focus or topic
position.
(80) *tóítóí lí ólí ómóhé í'

quickly PF the man PAP.HOR come
‘It is quickly that the man should come.’
Another temporal rate adverb is èjéèjè ‘quickly.’4 It also manifests a highly restricted syntactic distribution. èjéèjè is limited to canonical declarative clauses inflected for imperfect aspect. It fails in perfect or prospective aspect clauses.
(81) ólì òkpòsò ò ó wèlò ótóí
á èjéèjè.

‘The woman is sweeping up the ground quickly.’

In contrast to the pattern in bíì phrases, the left stem in phrasal compound lexemes
does not show high tone spread and the initial vowel of the right stem raises to high.
Phrasal compound lexemes of this type denote an object of traditional religious
belief or an abstract condition of elevated status. Only phonologically identical
nouns occur in bíì lexemes.

Synthetic compounds in Emai consist of a prefix, a transitive verb root and either a
noun or adverb stem. Prefixes in synthetic compounds are a-, i-, e-, o-, o-, and u-;
only e- does not appear.
Synthetic compound lexemes with a verb and noun stem refer to household artifacts, natural world entities, social roles, locations and time conditions. Their interpretation reflects the relations ‘characterized by,’ ‘results from,’ or ‘used to undertake.’ In corresponding syntactic phrases, the noun stem corresponds to a direct
object argument of the transitive verb
Prefix a- converts transitive stative verbs or change of state verbs and their direct objects to location nominals denoting place. Resulting lexemes have the interpretation ‘spatial location characterized by VERB NOUN’ or an idiomatic variant of
this.

Complex synthetic compounds consist of a prefix, two verb roots and a single noun
stem. They exhibit structural subclasses based on noun position. Verb and noun
elements forming complex synthetic compounds correspond to verb phrase syntactic constituents. Prefixes in complex synthetic compounds include i-, o- and a-.
Complex synthetic compound lexemes of one structural type consist of two verb
roots with an intervening noun stem. The two verbs encode a complex predicate of
event end state or result, with the noun serving as predication direct object. These
lexemes encode relatively few entities, covering selected food items, games, social
roles, and abstract conditions.
Prefix i- converts end state verbs in series and their direct objects to patient
nominals denoting human social conditions. These lexemes have the interpretation
‘social condition characterized by VERB NOUN VERB.’

Prefix i- converts end state verbs in series and their direct object to patient nominals
denoting temporal conditions. Lexemes in this class have the sense ‘temporal span
characterized by VERB NOUN VERB.’Lexical compounds | 71ìnwòbòmóé ‘menstruation’: nwu moe ‘to hold,’ óbò ‘hand’

òèèmìré ‘one who remembers’: ee re ‘to remember,’ émì ‘thing’
òèmàshán ‘one who eats wastefully’: e shan ‘eat wastefully,’ émà ‘yam’
Complex synthetic compounds of a second structural type consist of two verb
roots followed by a noun stem. Only the prefix a- appears in this complex synthetic
compound. Compounds of this type correspond to end state events. The only lexeme
in this subclass denotes a bodily posture.
Prefix a- converts end state verbs in series and a direct object to a patient nominal denoting posture. It has the sense ‘posture characterized by VERB VERB NOUN.’
àkùyúókhó ‘back flip’: ku ye ‘to toss toward,’ ùòkhò ‘back’
Complex synthetic compounds of a third structural type consist of two verb
roots, each followed by a noun stem. They form with prefixes a- and o-. Each noun
serves as direct object for its preceding verb in corresponding syntactic phrases.
Prefix a- converts transitive verbs in series with their direct objects to patient
nominals denoting temporal spans. Lexemes in this class are interpreted as ‘temporal condition characterized by VERB NOUN VERB NOUN.’

Complex synthetic compounds of a different structural character consist of a prefix,
verb root and an adverb or adverb derived from a verb. Predominantly intransitive
verbs are involved.
Lexemes of one structural type show a prefix, an intransitive verb and an adverb. They form with one prefix, i-, which converts intransitive stative verbs and
their adverbs to agent nominals denoting human social roles. Members have the
idiomatic sense ‘one characterized by VERB ADVERB.’
ìfòfòséén ‘dullard’
fofo ‘be cold,’ séén ‘lifeless’: ‘be a dullard’
Prefix i- converts intransitive change of state verbs and their adverbs to patient nominals denoting time entities. Resulting lexemes have the interpretation ‘temporal
span characterized by VERB ADVERB.’
ìkùnèdèdé ‘day time before dawn’
kun ‘to clear,’ èdèdé ‘moment ago’: ‘to clear moments ago’6
Lexicalizations involving adverbs also form with a verb verb collocation where
the second verb functions in syntactic phrases as an adverbial or particle. Lexemes
in this subclass encode social roles and abstract conditions. They show the prefixes
a-, o-, and o-.
Prefix a- converts intransitive activity verbs and their verbal adverbials to patient nominals denoting human social roles. Resulting lexemes have the interpretation ‘one characterized by VERB ADVERB.’
àúkhòò ‘disfavored wife’
u ‘to act,’ khòò ‘to be wicked’: ‘to ill treat, abuse’
àrààkhùà ‘professional robber’

lexemes have the sense ‘physical condition characterized by VERB NOUN ADVERB.’
àùèmìráá ‘excessiveness’
u ‘do,’ émì ‘thing,’ raa ‘exceed’: ‘do something excessively’Lexical compounds | 73Prefix o- converts a transitive activity verb and particle gbe (from verb gbe ‘be dull’)
to a nominal denoting a condition of human existence. Resulting lexemes have the
sense ‘condition characterized by VERB PARTICLE.’
òègbé ‘overeating, gluttony’
e ‘to eat’ gbè ‘much’: ‘to eat excessively’
Prefix o- converts intransitive activity verbs and grammaticalized gbe to patient
nominals denoting natural entities. Lexemes in this class have the meaning ‘thing
characterized by VERB PARTICLE.’
óságbè ‘fish with sting fins’
sa ‘to sting,’ gbè ‘much’: ‘to sting often’
Lexemes of another structural type consist of a prefix, an auxiliary form, an adverbial preverb and a verb root. Only one prefix participates in such compounds.
Prefix a- converts an intransitive activity verb, negative particle ì and ability
preverb miti to a patient nominal denoting an abstract condition. These lexemes
have the interpretation ‘condition characterized by NEG PREVERB VERB.’
àìmìtíkòò ‘uncountable condition’
ì NEG, miti ‘able,’ koo ‘to count’
Prefix a- converts a transitive change of state verb, its direct object and the preverb
se to an agent nominal denoting an animate object. Resulting lexemes have the
sense ‘one characterized by PREVERB VERB NOUN.’
ásèséòkpà ‘cockerel, immature cock’
se DUR, se ‘to reach,’ òkpà ‘cock’: ‘one yet to reach cock state’2.4.6 Synthetic compounds with particles
Synthetic compounds of a distinct structural character form with prefix, verb root
and postverbal particle. Particles included are Change of State (CS) a, Change of
Location (CL) o, and Applicative (APP) Change of Possession li/ni. Resulting lexemes
encode conditions or entities that assume change of some sort. Not participating in
synthetic compounds are the postverbal particles for Temporal Perspective (lee) and
Projected Adherence (e). Particle compound prefixes are i-, o-, e- and a-.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"

Adverbials headed by nominals referring to larger-than-day segments of time
are formed with ósè ‘week,’ ùkìn ‘month’ and úkpè ‘year.’ They are grounded to future or past time depending on modifier type. When accompanied by a relative
clause incorporating the verb series raa re ‘pass,’ they exhibit a distributional pattern similar to òdè ‘yesterday.’ Thus, ósè,’ ùkìn and úkpè relative clause adverbials
accept Past perfect but not Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.

rejects their Ingressive and Egressive functions.
The éghé áìn adverbial is limited to affirmative declarative statements. It rejects
negative statements, as indicated by the failure of Past Absolute negation ya (*ólí

An adverbial of temporal punctuality consists of a vbi phrase whose complement is
headed by the noun úkpédè (derived from édè ‘day’) followed by an ordinal numeral. Ordinal vbi phrases designate a day-unit in which an event occurred. They only
appear in clauses inflected for Past perfect and Predictive, not Present perfect, Anticipative or imperfect aspect.

órán [take days three wood wood] ‘Take three days to cut wood / Cut wood for three

prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions (*ólí ómóhé híán' órán íkpédè
èéà? [the man PAP.cut wood days three] ‘Did the man cut wood for three days?’).
íkpédè duration adjuncts fail with either function of aspectualizer ya (*ólí ómòhè

started to cut wood for three days’) or mo (*ólí ómòhè móò híán órán íkpédè èéà [the
man PRP.EG cut wood days three] ‘The man almost completed cutting wood for

Adverbial phrases that temporally bound an event are framed by preposition vbi and
a complement consisting of the relational noun ékéín ‘inside’ followed by nominal
úkpédè/íkpédè ‘day’ and a cardinal numeral. Anchored to the moment of utteranceOverview of temporal adverbials | 311or other acknowledged reference point, these phrases establish a temporal bound
within which an event occurs and beyond which it does not. Constructions with
temporal bound adverbials require a predicate phrase referring to an internally
bounded event, as happens with the bounded verb u óì ‘do it’ or with unbounded
hian ‘cut’ in construction with postverbal Temporal Perspective lee.
(55) a. ójé ú'

b. ójé ló

‘Oje will finish cutting the wood within three days.’
Temporal bound adverbials are limited to clauses inflected for Past perfect and Predictive. They reject Present perfect, Anticipative and imperfect.

b. ójé ló
hìàn ólí óràn léé vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà.

híán ólí óràn léé?

Additional properties of temporal bound adjuncts arise in selected constructions. Clauses with vbí ékéín íkpédè adverbials occur as imperatives (rè ékéín íkpédè
èéà híán ólí óràn léé [take inside days three cut the wood TEMP] ‘Finish cutting the
wood within three days’), where the temporal phrase occurs as complement of verb
re ‘take’ in series. Bound vbí ékéín íkpédè adverbials fail as prohibitives, negative
statements or polar questions.
Temporal bound adjuncts fail to co-occur with any functions of boundary aspectualizer preverbs ya (*ólí ómóhé yà híán óràn léé vbí ékéín íkpédè èéà [the man312 | Adverbial adjunctsPAP.PA cut wood TEMP LOC inside days three] ‘The man used to cut wood within

Temporal frequency adverbials occur in morphosyntactic shapes derived from a
cardinal numeral. Articulating event frequency or iteration, they correspond to ísékà
‘how often’ direct questions and fall into four subclasses.
Members of one subclass reflect a definite, absolute frequency value. Morphologically definite frequency forms are expressed as synthetic compounds consisting
of a numeral preceded by prefix ì- and the verb se ‘reach.’ There is no evidence of a
restriction on numeral participation in this morphological shape.
ìsòkpá ‘once’
ìsèvá ‘twice’ìsèéá ‘thrice’
ìsèélè ‘four times’Absolute frequency adverbs occur in clauses inflected for Past perfect and prospective Predictive. They reject Present perfect, imperfect and Anticipative.

‘The man ate food twice.’
b. ólí ómóhé ló

Emai exhibits embedded sentence (S) complements and verb phrase (VP) complements. S-complements exhibit three types based on complementizer form: indicative (IND) khi, conditional (COND) si and subjunctive (SBJ) li. Broadly reflective of
types in Lyons (1977), each indicates a distinct commitment by speaker regarding
occurrence or potential occurrence of complement event: fully committed khi, conditionally committed si or noncommittal li. Occurring clause initially, each complementizer constrains its subject noun phrase as well as inflectional, auxiliary and
preverb phrases.
(1) a. ólì òkpòsò één-í
khí ólí ómóhé é'
ólí émàè.
the woman PRP.know-F IND the man PAP.eat the food

‘The woman is asking Ohi whether the man has eaten the food.’
c. ólì òkpòsò ò ó hòò lí
ólí ómóhé è ólí émàè.
the woman SC C want SUBJ the man eat the food
‘The woman wants the man to eat the food.’
Related to complement constructions are indirect questions (IQ). IQs, framed by
ébé'/ébí'…i or émé'/émí' for example (Chapter 7, 7.5), also restrict their subject
phrase as well as inflectional, auxiliary and preverb phrases.
(2) ólí ókpósó ré'
é ébé' ójé í'
é ólí émàè.
the woman PAP.CONC say how Oje PAP.MAN eat the food
‘The woman wondered how Oje ate the food.’
An additional complement type is direct quote (DQ). Although its syntactic shape is
quite variable, ranging from complex sentences to single words, it provides an implicit standard for assessing marked S-complement behavior.
(3) ólí ómóhé ré'
é óí “ólì òkpòsò gbé
ólí ófè.”
the man PAP.CONC say it the woman PRP.kill the rat
‘The man then said, “The woman has killed the rat.”’
VP-complements also constrain inflectional, auxiliary and preverb phrases. They
show the nonfixed tonal pattern of a subjunctive verb phrase. In addition, theirS-complement types and their interrogatives | 797logical subject, the preceding verb’s direct object (ólí ómóhé ‘the man’), is restricted
as to syntactic and tonal shape.
(4) ólí ókpósó ré'
é ólí ómóhé è ólí émàè.
the woman PAP.CONC tell the man eat the food
‘The woman then told the man to eat the food.’13.1 S-complement types and their interrogatives
S-complements marked by khi, li or si answer distinct information questions. Complements marked by khi or li correspond to émé'/émí' ‘what.’
(5) a. émé' ólí ómóhé é'

‘What does the woman want?’
ò ó hòò lí
ólí ómóhé gbè ólí ófè.

she PAP.ask him COND the man PRP.kill the rat
‘She asked him whether the man has killed the rat.’
VP-complements, showing no overt morphological marking, correspond to direct
questions with émé'/émí' ‘what.’ However, VP-complement alone is insufficient as a
response; both matrix and embedded VP are required.

‘Kill the rat.’13.2 Complement type constraints
S-complements, IQ-complements and VP-complements vary in their syntactic properties. S-complements headed by indicative khi and conditional si often pattern
alike, while subjunctive li and VP complements often show similar behavior. IQcomplements reveal structural patterns frequently distinct from other complements.
The variable resistance of complement type to grammatical categories reflects a
scale. Indicative khi exhibits the least resistance, with conditional si at nearly the
same level. VP complements show greater resistance along with subjunctive li. IQ
restricts grammatical categories at a level between the pair khi-si and li-VP.1
khi > si > IQ > li >VPEmai’s complement scale is illustrated by polarity and mood expression. Scomplements, IQ-complements and VP-complements show variable polarity and
mood. Sentences incorporating S-complement types, IQ-complements2 and VP complements assume a polar interrogative form uniformly. However, only VP complements assume imperative shape.

In the expression of negation, S-complements, IQ-complements and VPcomplements vary. Perfect Negation (NEG) -ì appears in S-complements headed byComplement type constraints | 799khi and si. Perfect Negation is disallowed for IQ-complements, li complements and
VP-complements.

As indicated in the following sections, Emai complement types restrict inflectional, auxiliary and preverb categories (Chapter 3). Inflection includes aspect, auxiliary includes deontic and epistemic modality as well as relative tense. Preverb
categories are aspectualizer, temporal, subject attributive, quantitative, evaluative
and manner-demonstrative. Overall, khi and si complements limit fewer of these
grammatical categories. IQ complements are somewhat more restricted. The most
severe restrictions affect subjunctive li and VP complements. The latter two complement types reject inflection, all auxiliaries and most preverb categories, although
li complements show deontic Hortative í with pronouns.","[820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825]"

"9 Postverbal particles in complex predicates
Emai verb phrases show complex predicates framed by postverbal particles in construction with verb forms. Each verb-particle predication type is associated with
multiple semantic functions. Nonetheless, each in its principal function signals
either Change of Possession (Applicative, APP) li/ni, Change of Location (CL) o,
Change of State (CS) a, Projected Change of Location with Adherence (PAD) e, or
Temporal Perspective (TEMP) lee.

Oje PRP.eat the food TEMP
‘Oje finished eating all the food.’
Two Emai particles specify event aspect (CS and TEMP), while three characterize
argument structure. Particle co-occurrence relates to function. Temporal Perspective
lee combines with each of the other particles. Change of State, Change of Location
and Projected Adherence are mutually exclusive. Change of State and Change of
Location each combine with Applicative li/ni, although not when the latter marks
Change of Possession recipient. Instead, li/ni in these constructions with CS a and
CL o codes a benefactive semantic role.

with its preceding verb depending on structural conditions. Moreover, particles
exhibit tone behavior distinct from adverbials, since they fail to induce high tone
spread at right edge of a preceding direct object constituent. No postverbal particle
serves as a simple predicate.
In this chapter as well as Chapters 10, 11 and 12 addressing other complex predications, we detail a range of structural properties for each predication type. These
include component verbs and related noun phrases as well as restrictions concerning inflectional aspect, polarity and mood, possible repositioning of arguments to
discourse prominent positions and predication response to aspectually sensitive
question types. The latter take the shape of discourse frames incorporating
émé'/émí' NP ú ‘What did someone do?’ and émé'/émí' ú ‘What happened?’.1
(3) a. émé' ójé ú'-ì?
what Oje PAP.do-F
‘What did Oje do?’
b. émé' ó ú'?
what it PAP.happen
‘What happened?’9.1 Applicative
Complex predicates coded by postverbal Applicative (APP) li/ni and its nominal
complement express recipient or beneficiary relations conveyed in English by
‘to/for’ or ‘from.’ Component verbs are transitive or intransitive.
Applicative form varies according to its complement. Its li exponent occurs with
a lexical noun complement. The ni form appears with a pronoun complement or
when the Applicative is stranded in postverbal position, as in positive focus (PF)
constructions marked by li/ni.
(4) a. ólì òkpòsò shén

the woman PRP.sell yam APP farmer
‘The woman sold yam to the farmer.’
b. ólì òkpòsò shén

c. ólí ónwímé nà lí ólí ókpósó shén'
émà ní.
the farmer this PF the woman PAP.sell yam APP
‘It was this farmer who the woman sold yam to.’Applicative | 519Applicative li/ni complements require dative pronouns (e.g. áìn ‘him,’ Chapter 5),
which differ in phonological shape from accusative pronouns (e.g. óì ‘him’). Applicative li/ni does not accept place nouns (e.g. áfúzé' ‘Afuze’) or ellipted associative
phrases of place marked by ésì/ísì.
(5) àlèkè shén
ólí émà ní áìn / *óì / *áfúzé' / *ésì ònwìmè.
Aleke PRP.sell the yam APP him him Afuze ASS farmer
‘Aleke sold the yam to him.’
In complex predicates with verbs of financial transaction (shen ‘sell,’ de ‘buy’)
and thus possession change, Applicative li/ni codes event Recipient.
(6) a. ólì òkpòsò shén
émà lí
ònwìmè.
the woman PRP.sell yam APP farmer
‘The woman sold yam to the farmer.’
b. ólì òkpòsò dé
émà lí
ònwìmè.
the woman PRP.buy yam APP farmer
‘The woman bought yam for the farmer.’
Recipient li/ni also co-occurs with transitive verbs of object manipulation, e.g. nwu
‘take hold’ and roo ‘pick up.’ Predication sense is ‘give.’ Independent of the li/ni
construction, manipulation verbs like nwu with only a direct object complement
convey the sense ‘carry,’ not ‘give.’
(7) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú
émà lí
ònwìmè.
the woman PRP.take yam APP farmer
‘The woman gave yam to the farmer.’
b. ólì òkpòsò nwú

‘The woman has carried the yam.’
c. ólí ómòhè róó
ùhàì lí
òhí.
the man PRP.pick.out arrow APP Ohi
‘The man picked out an arrow for Ohi.’
Recipient li/ni predications also accept transitive verbs like re, which fail as simple
predicates.
(8) ólì òkpòsò ré
émà lí
òhí / *ré émà.
the woman PRP.take yam APP Ohi take yam
‘The woman gave pounded yam to Ohi.’520 | Postverbal particles in complex predicatesRecipient li/ni predications require permanent possession exchange. Entity
transfer from one person to another or location change without possession change
is not sufficient, as with the projection and release verb fi ‘throw.’
(9) *ólì òkpòsò fí
ùgbòfì lí
ònwìmè.
the woman PRP.throw orange APP farmer
‘The woman threw an orange to the farmer.’
Recipient li/ni predications contrast with complex allative ‘take’ predications
marked by ye ‘move to’ in series. Allative conveys temporary possession change.
(10) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú
émà yé
ònwìmè.

b. ólí ómòhè róó

the man PRP.pick.out arrow move.to Ohi
‘The man took an arrow to Ohi (picking it out).’
Complex predicates with li/ni recipients reveal additional properties when expressing sentence aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood as well as
discourse repositioning of arguments. Recipient li/ni predications do not restrict
aspect. They inflect for Present perfect (right edge low tone subject phrase) and Past
perfect (right edge high tone subject phrase) as well as imperfect Continuous.

imperatives, prohibitives, negative statements and polar questions.

the woman PRP.sell yam APP the farmer
‘Did the woman sell yam to the farmer?’
Complex predicates with recipient li/ni also do not inhibit discourse repositioning of
their arguments. Subject, direct object and li/ni complement correspond to a focus
position constituent.
(15) a. ólí ókpósó nà lí ó shén'
émà lí

‘It was yam that the woman sold to a farmer.’
c. ònwìmè lí ólí ókpósó shén'
émà ní.
farmer PF the woman PAP.sell yam APP
‘It was a farmer that the woman sold yam to.’
Complex li/ni predicates express a range of argument roles or functions in addition to recipient. These are beneficiary, aversive and addressee. Each is briefly illustrated below.
li/ni complements identify event beneficiary, an argument of the predication
that benefits in some way from an event (Blake 2001). Beneficiary functions occur
with simple predicates (hóó ‘wash) and complex predicates (nwú móé ‘hold’).","[542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547]"
"358 | Noncanonical constructionsFrom the quantity class, only nonintensifier preverbs are acceptable in focus
matrix clauses. Focus constructions reject Absolute Intensifier zemi and Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze. Collective gba and Emphatic Reflexive dobo nonetheless occur.
Both affirmative and negative focus accept Emphatic Reflexive dobo regardless of
mood (ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó dóbó' óì é ólí émà [the man PF NF he PAP.REFL him eat the
yam] ‘It was / wasn't the man who by himself ate the yam’).7 With Collective gba,
matrix clause is declarative under positive focus (ólí émà lí élí ímóhé gbá' è [the yam
PF the men PAP.COL eat] ‘It was the yam that the men ate together’) but interrogative under negative focus (ólí émà kí élí ímóhé gbá' è? [the yam NF the men PAP.COL
eat] ‘Wasn't it the yam that the men ate together?’).
Matrix clause focus constructions never allow any of the remaining preverbs:
evaluative duu ‘for no reason,’ woo ‘instead,’ and kuku ‘after all;’ subject attributive
dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu ‘courageously,’ dégbè ‘carefully,’ totóbo intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly;’ or manner-demonstrative DMD ìyó and PMD ìná.
Additionally, focus constructions are limited by S-complement type and clause
subordination. Positive focus constructions occur under indicative and conditional
complements, marked by khi and si respectively. But they never appear under subjunctives signaled by li (*òjè ò ó hòò lí ólì òkpòsò lí ó shén' ólí émà [Oje SC C want

[Oje SC C ask COND the woman NF she PAP.sell the yam] ‘Oje is asking whether it
wasn’t the woman who sold the yam’) or subjunctive li complements (*òjè ò ó hòò lí

Verbs in assertive pattern three with CS a exhibit a sense shift. For instance, khuye
reveals one sense as a simple predicate (‘close’) but another as complex predicate
with CS a (‘open’). Often, the contrasting senses show a reversive relation. Regardless of perfect or imperfect aspect, predication sense of khuye and CS a is ‘open.’

the man PRP.close door

c. ólí ómòhè ò ó khùyè úkhúédé à.

‘The man is opening the door.’
Absent CS a, khuye in perfect or imperfect aspect has the sense ‘close.’

the man PAP.close door
‘The man closed / shut the door.’
b. ólì ómòhè khúyé

‘The man has closed / shut the door.’538 | Postverbal particles in complex predicatesc. ólì ómòhè ò ó khùyè úkhùèdè.
the man SC C close door
‘The man is closing / shutting the door.’
Corresponding intransitive khuye a predications maintain their sense. They express
the meaning ‘open’ with perfect and imperfect aspect.

á'.
the door
PRP.close CS
‘The door has opened.’
b. ólí úkhùèdè ò ó khùyé à.
the door
SC C close CS
‘The door is opening.’
Simple intransitive khuye has the sense ‘be closed, shut.’ It allows only perfect aspect and under bare predicate conditions shows Factative suffix -i.
(68) ólì úkhùèdè khúyé-ì / *ò ó khùyé.
the door
PRP.close-F SC C close
‘The door is shut / closed.’
Another pattern three verb with CS a that expresses a reversive semantic relation is vuye. It has transitive and intransitive shapes. With transitive vuye in perfect
or imperfect aspect, CS a contributes to the sense ‘open.’
(69) a. òjè vúyé
ólì ògó á / *vúyé ólì ògó.
Oje PRP.close the bottle CS close the bottle
‘Oje opened the bottle.’
b. òjè ò ó vùyé ólì ògó á / *ò ó vùyè ólì ògó.
Oje SC C close the bottle CS SC C close the bottle
‘Oje is opening the bottle.’
As a complex intransitive predication, vuye and CS a again convey the sense ‘open.’
There is no way to fashion the ‘open’ sense with Factative suffix -i.
(70) a. ólì ògó vúyé'

the bottle PAP.close CS

‘The bottle got opened.’
b. ólì ògó ò ó vùyé à / *ò ó vùyé.
the bottle SC C close CS SC C close
‘The bottle is getting opened.’Change of state | 539Absent CS a, vuye expresses the sense ‘close.’ As a transitive shape, vuye ‘close’
inflects for perfect and imperfect aspect.
(71) a. ójé vúyé'
ólì ògó.
Oje PAP.close the bottle
‘Oje closed the bottle.’
b. òjè vúyé
ólì ògó.
Oje PRP.close the bottle
‘Oje has closed the bottle.’
c. òjè ò ó vùyé ólì ògó.
Oje SC C close the bottle
‘Oje is closing the bottle.’
As an intransitive, vuye ‘close’ inflects for perfect and imperfect. Under bare intransitive conditions in the perfect, vuye requires Factative suffix -i.

the bottle SC C close
‘The bottle is closing.
b. ólì ògó vúyé'-ì

‘It was this door that the man opened.’9.3.1.4 Assertive pattern four
Complex predicates of affirmative pattern four constrain aspect but not transitivity.
CS a with transitive verb soo is obligatory in the perfect but optional in the imperfect. Verb lexical meaning asserts a change of state but not a maximal change. However, verb plus CS a in either perfect or imperfect entails a telic, maximal change.
(77) a. ólì òkpòsò sóó
úkpún mè á / *sóó úkpún mè.
the woman PRP.tear cloth my CS
tear cloth my
‘The woman tore my cloth end to end / tore up my cloth.’

the woman SC C tear cloth my CS
‘The woman is tearing my cloth end to end.’
c. ólì òkpòsò ò ó sòò úkpùn mé.
the woman SC C tear cloth my
‘The woman is tearing my cloth.’
Intransitive pattern four verbs require CS a. Intransitive soo in the perfect takes an
obligatory CS a. It shows no imperfect inflection and in the bare perfect fails to occur with Factative suffix -i.","[561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566]"

"Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 7gbé áwà [gbáwà]
kill dogdé óràn
buy wood[dóràn]Verbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representations diverge.
sén áwà [sánwà]
stab dogtón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vowels (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.
kóó ébè [kóébè]
read bookkó
émà [kémà]
plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.
sá óì [sáóì]
fetch itgbé óì [gbéóì]
kill itOrthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide formation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identification of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency relative to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.
àòó ‘thought’
èkpà ‘vomit’oo ‘to think’
kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.
òzètò
[ò-ze-étò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hairòdènyò
[ò-da-ényò]
‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.
ákèvà
[á-ken-èvá]
‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-twoókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]
‘upward’
prefix-be.next.to-topIn compounds, non-nasal vowels elide and are not rendered orthographically. In
noun-noun compounds, orthographic practice and broad phonetic rendering align,
except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.
ákòísí' [àkò
òísí']
‘holster’ sheath gunákùhàì [àkò
ùhàì]
‘quiver’ sheath arrowElision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms referring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.
ésèsé
[ésè-ésè]
‘direct center of’
ésè
‘center of’èdèdé
[édè-édè]
‘moments ago’

close vowels of augmentative údù and diminutive úvbì, when preceding a vowel,
assume a glide shape. Orthographic practice retains the corresponding vowel.

Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).
(1) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.
(2) è ólí émàè.
eat the food
‘Eat the food.’
Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.
(3) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.
(4) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè?
the man PRP.eat the food
‘Has the man eaten the food?’
Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).
(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
the man SC C eat the food
‘The man is eating the food, is he?’10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by presence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full account of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be undertaken.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

exhibit limited polarity and mood potential. They appear as negative statements,
never as affirmative statements. The u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè collocations also never
appear as polar questions, imperatives or prohibitives. In addition, neither u ólì èsèn

‘The man is acting this way / is doing so.’
e. ólí ómóhé ló

the man PRED do DMD
‘The man will act that way.’
Intransitive u constructions limit auxiliaries. They permit deontic Hortative (ò í
ù ìná [he HOR do PMD] ‘He should perform this way’) and epistemic Hypothetical
kha (ó khà ú ìyó [he PAP.HYP act DMD] ‘He would have acted that way’), Concessive
rere (ó ré'rè ú ìyó? [he PAP.CONC do DMD] ‘Did he even act that way?’), Deductive za
(ò záà ú ìná [he PRP.DED act PMD] ‘He must have acted this way’) and Resultative za
(ó zá' ú ìyó [he PAP.RES act DMD] ‘As a result, he acted that way’). No other epistemic forms occur, particularly speculative Dubitatives vba and bia, and Certaintive ma.
In a more severe fashion, intransitive u restrains relative tense. It rejects Subsequent kpe, and Anterior ke, as unacceptable ke suggests (*ó ké' ú ìyó [he PAP.ANT
do DMD] ‘He acted that way afterward’).
Intransitive u limits preverbs. It disallows manner-demonstrative preverbs ìná
and ìyó. With aspectualizers, intransitive u permits some phasal forms, permitting
Repetitive che (ò chéè ú ìyó [he PRP.REP do DMD] ‘He acted that way again’) and
Additive gbo (ò gbóò ú ìyó [he PRP.ADD do DMD] ‘He acted that way too’) but not
Durative se or Punctual ghe. Intransitive u allows only the boundary aspectualizer
Past Absolute ya (ólí ómóhé yà ú ìyó [the man PAP.PA do DMD] ‘The man used to act
that way’). It rejects Past Absolute mo, Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Conative òó.
Intransitive u admits only one evaluative preverb, kuku (ólí ómóhé kú'kù ú ìyó
[the man PAP.POEV do DMD] ‘The man afterall acted that way’). It rejects duu ‘for no
reason’ and woo ‘instead.’470 | Be, do, happen and haveRelative to remaining preverbs, intransitive u accepts only a few. It allows one
temporal preverb, kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò ú ìyó [man PAP.earlier do DMD] ‘The man

ú ìyó [the man PAP.mistakenly do DMD] ‘The man mistakenly acted that way’) and
gbúdu (ólí ómóhé gbú'dù ú ìyó [the man PAP.courageously do DMD] ‘The man courageously acted that way’). It disallows temporal bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’ and
gue ‘unexpectedly’ as well as subject attributives dábo ‘deliberately,’ miti ‘able,’
dúda ‘defiantly,’ kekégbe ‘perseveringly,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’
Intransitive u restricts quantity preverbs as well. It accepts Emphatic Reflexive
dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú ìyó [the man PAP.REFL him do DMD] ‘The man himself
acted that way’) and Collective gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú ìyó [the men PAP.COL do DMD]
‘The men together acted that way’). However, intransitive u rejects Absolute Intensifier zemi and Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze.
Relative to postverbal forms, intransitive u constructions are generally more tolerant. Intransitive u permits a temporal particle as well as deictic adverbs. It allows
Temporal Perspective lee but not Temporal Degree gbe (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó léé / *gbé
[the woman PAP.do DMD TEMP much] ‘The woman acted that way already / finished acting that way’). With appropriate inflection, intransitive u accepts deictic
adjuncts for past (òdè), recent past (èghéènà), future (ákhò), immediate present

Intransitive u ‘do/behave’ occurs with a following adverbial showing ideophonic

Transitive u ‘happen’ constructions are syntactically rigid. They require predicate
negation, the noun émì as subject position head and an animate noun as direct object. Transitive u ‘happen’ has no corresponding affirmative.","[494, 495, 496, 497, 498]"

‘As for the yam, it is small.’
The property term position following u, however, never corresponds to focus position (*négénégén lí ólí ómóhé ú' [wiry PF the man PAP.be] ‘It is wiry that the man is’)
or topic position (*négénégén, ólí ómòhè ú [wiry the man PRP.be] ‘A wiry character is

PRY and its constituents correspond to two information question types. Subject
corresponds to a question with sortal significance framed by émé' and distal demonstrative áìn. émé' alone is insufficient. As a response, a bare noun in a Specifier copula óò construction is required. A PRY clause as response is unacceptable. No other
interrogative pronoun (e.g. óé' ‘who’ or ékà ‘how many’) queries PRY subject.

Locative ‘be’ (LCT) constructions assign a nominal referent to a location. They are
framed by the complementary predicates ri and e. Each is followed by a prepositional phrase headed by vbi: NP ri vbi NP, NP e vbi NP. Concerning their distribution, ri‘be’ forms | 443appears under realis conditions, e.g. affirmative declarative in the perfect, and e
under irrealis conditions, e.g. imperfect and prospective aspect, negation and deontic modality.
LCT with ri and e differ in polarity and mood potential. e but not ri accepts Perfect Negation. Neither construction displays an imperative or prohibitive shape.

b. ólì òkpòsò í ì

‘Isn't the woman in the house?’
LCT constructions with ri and e show complementary inflection, auxiliaries and
preverbs. Aspect is expressed tonally in an irregular fashion. For Past perfect, ri
shows low tone and right edge high tone subject. For Present perfect, ri shows high
low tone and right edge low tone subject. Under conditions typical for Past and
Present perfect, ri would have shown, respectively, downstepped high (rí') and a
simple high (rí) tone (*ólí ókpósó rí' / ólì òkpòsò rí vbì èkìn [the woman be / the woman be LOC market] ‘The woman was in the market’).

the woman PRED be LOC house

LCT constructions selectively express deontic and epistemic modality. e accepts
deontic Hortative (ólì òkpòsò í è vbì ìwè [the woman HOR be LOC house] ‘The woman
should be in the house’) and epistemic Hypothetical kha (ólí ókpósó khà é vbì ìwè
[the woman PAP.HYP be LOC house] ‘The woman would have been in the house’). ri
accepts neither.

and Certaintive ma (ólí ókpósó má' rì vbí ìwè [the woman PAP.CER be LOC house]
‘The woman surely was in the house’). Neither LCT predicate permits Concessive
rere or Resultative za.
LCT predications restrict relative tense. ri admits Subsequent kpe (ólì òkpòsò kpé
rì / *é vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.SUB be be LOC house] ‘The woman was yet in the
house despite upcoming events’), whereas e permits neither relative tense Subsequent kpe nor Anterior ke.
LCT imposes strong restrictions on preverbs. ri allows aspectualizers Durative se
(ólì òkpòsò séè rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.DUR be LOC house] ‘The woman continues to be in the house’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí ókpósó mó' rì vbí ìwè [the woman
PAP.PA be LOC house] ‘The woman at one time was in the house’).
e permits Past Absolute ya but only in polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó yà é vbí
íwé élá ódíánmì? [the woman PAP.PA be LOC house past afternoon] ‘Did the woman
used to be at home in the afternoons?’). No other aspectualizers are acceptable with
either LCT verb.
LCT constructions reject all remaining preverb classes: evaluative (e.g. kuku),
temporal (e.g. kpao), subject attributive (e.g. dégbe), manner-demonstrative (e.g.
ìyó) and quantity (e.g. dobo óì), as shown in *ólì òkpòsò kúkù / kpáò / dégbè / íyó' /
dóbó óì rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.POEV initially steadily DMD REFL her be LOC
house] ‘The woman after all / initially / steadily / that way / by herself is in the
house’.
In LCT constructions verb affixes, postverbal temporal particles and temporal
adjuncts are restricted. Relative to postverbal particles, ri with high low tone admits

transitive (heen) or intransitive (shan, gbe, la). so identifies a motion subevent’s
quantitative end state as having telic status. Predication sense is ‘to the end, to the
top’ depending on axis of orientation.

As a simple predicate, so manifests two primary senses, both of which assume a
process of some duration followed by a singular end state condition.14 Neither sense

Emai complex predicates assert the telic status of a change of existence state. V1
forms denote an incremental change of existence with an implied end state open to718 | Aspect expressing complex predicatestelic specification. Existence end states manifest a distinct perceptual character
when oriented on the vertical or horizontal axis by V2 re and its ‘rise’ or ‘arrive’
sense, respectively. In effect, re expresses a change in entity existence from absence
to presence.
With an intransitive verb, e.g. ze ‘grow,’ or a verb like filo ‘thrust’ as V1, re ‘rise’
predications assume incremental change of state on the vertical axis. They augment
intransitive subject or transitive direct object referent substance and assert perceptible emergence of the referent. In this respect, re predications represent the converse of predications with the postverbal Change of State (CS) a particle. While CS a
predications refer to dissolution of material substance (Chapter 9, 9.3.2.1), re predications refer to emergence of substance. Predications with CS a and re refer less to
change of material state (e.g. from intactness or wholeness toward dissolution) than
to change in entity existence. For re that would be from physically absent to physically present; however, for CS a it would be from physically present to physically
absent. Translation equivalents for re ‘rise’ predications engage English forms of
emergence: prepositions out, up or verbs sprout, arise.

On the horizontal axis with V2 re ‘arrive,’ existence end state has a deictic character. The deictic reference point is the speaker or a speaker defined position, from
which perspective a change of existence state from absence to presence has occurred. As V1, complex re ‘arrive’ predicates take transitive manipulation verbs or
transitive motion verbs (with attendant constraints on direct object shape).15 English
translation equivalents of predication sense rely on the verb bring or an additional
deictically centered clause of place.

the maize PRP.grow rise
‘The maize has sprouted / grown out.’
Other simple V1 intransitives (hu ‘boil,’ san ‘become pellucid,’ ohia ‘grow’) express a

predications existence end state is closed, i.e. achieved.

Relative tense forms are Anterior ke and Subsequent kpe. They identify a temporal
reference point that locates an event on the time axis relative to a reference time,
which may not be the moment of utterance. ke and kpe are mutually exclusive. In
multi-clause frames, each indicates clause subordination (Chapter 14, 14.3.1.)

‘The man ate the food afterward.’
b. ólí ómóhé kpé'
é ólí émàè.
the man PAP.SUB eat the food
‘Despite pending conditions, the man still / yet ate the food.’
Relative tense auxiliaries restrain expression of aspect and other auxiliaries. In
simple transitives, each relative tense auxiliary occurs only with Past perfect. With
imperfect aspect, only Subsequent is acceptable.
Anterior ke assumes a reference point event temporally anterior to verb event. It
translates ‘afterwhile, afterward, anymore.’

Relative tense auxiliary forms exhibit skewed distribution relative to deontic and
epistemic modality. Each fails with deontic modality Hortative í. Anterior ke and
Subsequent kpe reveal nonuniform distribution vis-à-vis epistemic modality and its
three judgment types. Neither combines with rational judgment Deductive za. Anterior and Subsequent precede Resultative za, although it is less natural for Resultative za to precede relative tense ke (ólí ómóhé ké' zà é ólí émàè [the man PAP.ANT
RES eat the food] ‘The man as a result ate the food afterward’) compared to (ólí
ómóhé zá' kè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.RES ANT eat the food] ‘As a result the man
afterward ate the food’) or kpe (ólí ómóhé kpé' zà é ólí émàè [the man PAP.SUB RES
eat the food] ‘The man as a result yet ate the food’) vis-à-vis (ólí ómóhé zá' kpè é ólí
émàè [the man PAP.RES SUB eat the food] ‘As a result the man yet ate the food’).
Relative tense ke and kpe reveal similar distribution with respect to speculative
judgment forms. Both occur with each of the speculative forms ma, vba and bia,
although combinations involving ke exhibit greater perfect aspect flexibility and
less sentence mood variation. In polar interrogatives, Anterior ke follows Certaintive
ma, (ólí ómóhé má' kè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.CER ANT eat the food] ‘Did the man
surely afterward eat the food?’) and (ólí ómòhè máà kè é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.CER
ANT eat the food] ‘Did the man surely afterward eat the food?’), as well as Dubitatives vba (ólí ómóhé vbá' kè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.DUB ANT eat the food] ‘Could
the man really eat the food afterward?’, ólí ómòhè vbáà kè é ólí émàèé? [the man

food] ‘Did the man actually eat the food afterward?’, ólí ómòhè bíà kè é ólí émàè?
[the man PRP.DUB ANT eat the food] ‘Has the man actually eaten the food afterward?’).
Subsequent kpe in declaratives follows Certaintive ma (ólí ómóhé má' kpè é ólí
émàè [the man PAP.CER SUB eat the food] ‘The man surely yet ate the food’) and in
polar interrogatives it follows Dubitatives vba (ólí ómóhé vbá' kpè é ólí émàè? [the
man PAP.DUB SUB eat the food] ‘Could the man really have eaten the food yet?’)
and bia (ólí ómóhé bíá' kpè é ólí émàè? [the man PAP.DUB SUB eat the food] ‘Did the
man actually yet ate the food?’).
Relative tense ke and kpe show still another pattern with assumptive judgment.
Both follow Hypothetical kha, kpe in declaratives (ólí ómóhé khà kpé é ólí émàè [the
man PAP.HYP SUB eat the food] ‘Despite pending conditions, the man would yet eat
the food’) but ke only in interrogatives (ólí ómóhé khà ké é ólí émàè? [the man
PAP.HYP ANT eat the food] ‘Would the man eat the food afterward?’) and (ólí ómòhè
khà ké é ólí émàèé? [the man PRP.HYP ANT eat the food] ‘Would the man have eaten
the food afterward?’). Neither ke nor kpe occurs with Concessive rere.","[137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142]"
"424 | Be, do, happen and have8.1.1 Equational identity khi
A relation of Equational Identity (EID) between two noun phrase referents is conveyed by copula khi. One noun phrase is positioned immediately following khi and
the other occurs in focus position marked by either positive focus li/ni or negative
focus ki. The subject position preceding khi requires the Identity subject pronoun i.
(2) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè.
the man this PF ID be farmer
‘It is this man who is a farmer.’
b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
the man this NF ID be farmer
‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’
Each noun phrase position associated with khi is syntactically restricted. khi subject
requires Identity pronoun í. It rejects nominative pronouns (e.g. o) or the indefinite
subject pronoun (a).
(3) ólí ómòhè lí í / *ó / *á khì ònwìmè.
the man PF ID he one be farmer
‘It is the man who is a farmer.’
Subject aside, noun phrase positions framed by Equational Identity khi require
number agreement. The focus position constituent and the post-khi constituent
must show equivalent number value (*élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì óáìn [the cloths R dark
PF ID be that.one] ‘That one is dark cloths’).
(4) élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì éáìn.
the cloth R dark PF ID be those.ones
‘Those are the dark cloths.’
The EID copula accepts few affixal, auxiliary, preverb or post-verbal forms normally associated with Emai verbs. khi constructions evince a predicate phrase with
nonfixed tone: low tone (khì) with bare predicate phrase, i.e. absence of inflectional,
auxiliary or preverb categories, but high tone (khí) when preceded by an auxiliary or
preverb, such as epistemic Certaintive ma.

leopard PF ID CER be chief ASS animal
‘It is the leopard who is certainly chief of the animals.’
‘The chief of the animals is certainly the leopard.’The EID copula rejects affixes typically associated with verbs. It disallows the
Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i. Relative
to inflection, khi constructions do not inflect for perfect, imperfect or prospective
aspect. EID constructions also limit auxiliaries. While incompatible with deontic
Hortative í, they allow epistemic Certaintive ma (òhí lí í mà khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID CER
be Oba] ‘It is ohi who surely is the King / Oba’), Dubitatives vba (òhí lí í vbà khí óbá'?
[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Could Ohi really be the King / Oba?’) and bia (òhí lí í bìà khí
óbá'?[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Is Ohi actually the King / Oba?’) as well as Concessive
rere (òhí lí í rèrè khí óbá'? [Ohi PF ID CONC be Oba] ‘So is it Ohi who is even the King
/ Oba?’). Unacceptable are epistemic Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical
kha.
EID khi is not as selective regarding relative tense. It admits Anterior ke (èkpèn lí
í kè khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID ANT be chief ASS animal] ‘It is the leopard who
has been chief of the animals since then / The chief of the animals since then is the
leopard’) and Subsequent kpe (èkpèn lí í kpè khí ójé ísì éànmì? [leopard PF ID SUB be
chief ASS animal] ‘Is the chief of the animals still the leopard?’).
As for preverbs, a few event-directed preverbs are grammatical in EID constructions. Participant-directed preverbs, though, are disallowed (Chapter 3, 3.2.8 for
preverb types). khi constructions admit only kuku from the evaluative class (òhí lí í
kùkù khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID POEV be Oba] ‘Ohi is afterall the King / Oba’) and kpao from
the temporal class (èkpèn lí í kpàò khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID earlier be chief
ASS animal]‘The chief of the animals initially was the leopard’).
Negative focus and interrogative mood establish conditions for aspectualizer
preverbs Additive gbo (òhí kí í gbò khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID ADD be Oba] ‘Isn't it also Ohi
who is King / Oba?’) and Durative se (òhí kí í sè khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID DUR be Oba]
‘Isn't it still Ohi who is King / Oba?’). No other aspectualizers occur with EID khi,
irrespective of mood or focus type. Of preverbs remaining, manner-demonstrative,
subject attributive and quantity, none is grammatical in a khi construction.
The EID copula is highly restricted Relative to postverbal complement particles
and adverbs. It disallows postverbal Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree
gbe (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì ònwìmè léé / gbé [the man PF ID be farmer TEMP /much] ‘It is
the man who already is a farmer / too much of a farmer’). Likewise, khi constructions reject temporal deictic adverbs, e.g. èghéènà ‘just recently’ (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì
ónwímé èghéènà [the man PF ID be farmer recently] ‘It was the man who was a
farmer recently’).2426 | Be, do, happen and haveCopula khi restricts polarity and mood. It appears as a polar question. But it rejects Perfect Negation (*ólí ómóhé nà lí í ì khì ònwìmè [the man this PF ID NEG be
farmer] ‘It is not this man who is a farmer’), allowing only negative focus ki. Concerning mood, khi constructions never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.

the man this PF ID be farmer
‘Is this man a farmer?’
b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
the man this NF ID be farmer
‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’
EID khi noun phrase positions exhibit contrasting grammatical properties. They
constrain NP type (pronoun < proper noun < common noun), definiteness (definite <
indefinite) and animacy (human < animate < inanimate). Regarding NP type, li/ni
focus position takes emphatic personal pronouns; nonemphatic nominative pronouns are unacceptable.
(7) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn lí í khì ònwìmè.

Focus position accepts most impersonal pronouns. It even accepts numeral headed
partitive phrases (èvá vbì ò lí í khì ìgbégbè [two LOC it PF ID be velvet] ‘It is two of
them that are velvet’). However, EID focus position disallows the partitive existential quantifier pronoun ósò (*ósò lí í khì ísì èmé [one PF ID be ASS my] ‘It is a certain
one that is mine’).
Focus position in khi constructions allows proper nouns and common nouns.
Proper nouns accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’

Oje alone PF ID be thief
‘It is Oje (alone) who is a thief.’
Regardless of their human (ómòhè), animate (èkpèn) or inanimate (ìgbégbè) character, bare common nouns appear in khi’s focus position.

In khi’s focus position constituent, common nouns take an optional definite predeterminer ((ólì) èkpà lí í khì ísì òjè [the bag PF ID be ASS Oje] ‘It is a / the bag which is
Oje's’). But they reject partitive existential quantifier ósò (*ómóhé ósò lí í khì óbá' ísì
èdó [man certain PF ID be Oba ASS Edo] ‘It is a certain man who is the Oba of Benin’).
Post-khi position is more restrained with regard to NP type and definiteness but
not animacy. It allows no personal pronouns, particularly those for accusative (óì).
Equally unacceptable are nominative (ò) and emphatic (ìyòìn) pronouns.
(10) *ólì ònwìmè lí í khì óì / ò / ìyòìn.
the farmer PF ID be him he he
‘It is a farmer that is he.’
Post-copula position limits impersonal pronouns. It admits those that are definite or
construed as definite. Demonstrative òáìn (ólí ómòhè lí í khì óáìn [the man PF ID be
that.one] ‘That is the man’) and universal quantifying èrèmé (ìgbégbè lí í khì èrèmé
[velvet PF ID be all] ‘All are velvet’) occur. Post-copula position disallows partitive
existential pronoun ósò (*ìgbégbè lí í khì ósò [velvet PF ID be certain.one] ‘Some
thing is velvet’).
Post-khi position also rejects numeral pronouns. èvá is representative alone
(*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá [velvet PF ID be two] ‘Two are velvet’) or as partitive vbi phrase
head (*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá vbì ò [velvet PF ID be two LOC it] ‘Two of them are velvet’).

partitive òkpá.

CS a and assertive pattern five verbs constrain aspect and transitivity. They require
perfect aspect in their transitive shape but reject CS a in imperfect aspect. Pattern
five verbs without CS a occur in imperfect aspect. Verbs in this pattern have a lexical
meaning that implies but does not entail a telic change of maximal extent. When
combined with CS a, the resulting complex predication entails a telic change.
For some verbs, CS a is available only in the transitive and only in the perfect.

Confirmative patterns affect verbs that assert a change of state but imply a telic end
state of maximal extent. CS a confirms end state actualization That CS a predications bear on implied and asserted meaning is shown by contrastive àmáà ‘but’
constructions. When perfect negation ì appears in àmáà’s second conjunct expressing an implied element of meaning, verbs without CS a in the first conjunct are
grammatical. However, verbs with CS a in the first conjunct are ungrammatical.

Complex CS a predicates of confirmative pattern two limit neither transitivity nor
aspect. With transitive hian ‘cut’ and direct object úì ‘rope,’ CS a is optional in perfect and imperfect aspect.8 For a transitive verb, lexical meaning implies but does
not entail a telic change of maximal extent. Verb plus CS a predications confirm the
implication of maximal extent in perfect and imperfect aspect.

Pattern three verbs denote a lexical meaning that implies but does not entail a telic
or maximal extent change of state. Verb plus CS a predications in the perfect, however, confirm actualization of a telic end state. CS a and confirmative pattern three
verbs constrain aspect and transitivity. In the perfect, they optionally take CS a, but
in the imperfect they reject CS a. Transitive guogho, for example, optionally takes CS
a in the perfect but not in the imperfect.

Sentence focus constructions reaffirm or negate the factuality of the proposition
expressed by their matrix clauses. Each construction consists of two structural components: a clause initial form, érí' for affirmation and kì for negation, followed by a
matrix clause. Relative to its matrix clause, each construction restricts subject noun
phrase, inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs, polarity and mood, and occurrence in
subordinate clauses.","[425, 426, 427, 428, 429]"
"8.2.2 Age construction u / vbi
In age constructions, the forms u and vbi occur in complementary distribution or
they alternate freely. This alternation reminds one of the nominal classifying copula
u/vbi (Chapter 8, 8.1.3). However, the copula form does not allow deontic and epistemic modality auxiliary forms. Age constructions do. Emai age constructions thus
employ transitive u ‘do’ where English relies on ‘be.’

Intransitive u has the sense ‘do.’ When it occurs with a manner adjunct such as
lèsèn ‘well,’ ìyó ‘that way’ or ìná ‘this way,’ it contributes to construction sense ‘act,
behave, perform.’ Noun phrase and verb phrase properties in intransitive u constructions are partially constrained. It is the case, however, that intransitive u shows
polarity and mood potential and allows discourse repositioning of its arguments.

‘Both youths acted that way’). Intransitive u subjects reject kindred élìyó and ódàn.
Intransitive u subject position allows most impersonal pronouns: demonstrative
deictic ònà (ònà ú ìná [this.one PRP.do PMD] ‘This one acted this way’) as well as
deictic óáín and contrastive ónóí (ónóí / óáín ú' ìyó [next.one that.one PAP.do DMD]

"16 | Orthography and grammatical overviewTone patterns affecting verbs and their phrases reflect the interaction of aspect
with other categories. We provide a brief overview of monotransitive clauses incorporating monosyllabic auxiliary, preverb and verb forms. Exceptions to these tonal
patterns occur due to factors such as multi-syllabic character, inherent low or high
tone, and verb transitivity.
Monosyllabic transitive verbs show two broad tone patterns that correlate with
grammatical marking of aspect and polarity. In perfect and imperfect aspect as well
as negation, fixed tone affects the verb. Nonfixed tone characterizes the verb in
prospective aspect.
In imperfect aspect with a lexical noun subject, transitive verb phrases show an
obligatory subject concord (SC) morpheme followed by an aspect morpheme (Continuous <C> or Habitual <H>). Under these conditions, verb tone is low.
(14) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó dà
ényó élìyó.
the man SC C drink wine that.kind
‘The man is drinking wine of that kind.’
b. ólí ómóhé ó ò dà
ényó élìyó.
the man SC H drink wine that.kind
‘The man drinks wine of that kind.’
For simple negation, a transitive verb is preceded by subject concord and negation
(NEG) morphemes. Under this condition, verb tone is low as well.
(15) ólí ómòhè í ì
dà
ényó élìyó.
the man SC NEG drink wine that.kind
‘The man did not drink wine of that kind.’
Verb tone in the imperfect remains unaffected by auxiliary and preverb constituents
interposed between aspect and the verb. When a preverb such as che, for instance,
follows subject concord and aspect or negation constituents and precedes the verb,
tone is high on the preverb. However, verb tone remains fixed on low.
(16) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ché dà
ényó élìyó.
the man SC C REP drink wine that.kind
‘The man is drinking wine of that kind again.’
b. ólí ómòhè í ì
ché dà
ényó élìyó.
the man SC NEG REP drink wine that.kind
‘The man did not drink wine of that kind again.’Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 17Verbs in imperfect aspect or perfect negation with multiple auxiliaries or preverbs
behave similarly. Verb tone remains low, while multiple auxiliary or preverb (che,
gbo) constituents show an alternating high down-stepped high tone pattern.
(17) ólí ómòhè í ì
ché gbó' dà
ényó élìyó.
the man SC NEG REP ADD drink wine that.kind
‘The man did not again drink wine of that kind too.’
Transitive verbs show a contrasting tonal pattern with perfect aspect. With a
lexical noun subject in the perfect, no subject concord or aspect morpheme is segmentally realized. Verbs exhibit high tone, downstepped high (dá'), when preceded
by the right edge high tone subject phrase of Past perfect (PAP), or basic high (dá),
when preceded by the right edge low tone subject phrase of Present perfect (PRP).
(18) a. ólí ómóhé dá'

the man PAP.drink wine that.kind
‘The man drank wine of that kind.’
b. ólí ómòhè dá
ényó élìyó.
the man PRP.drink wine that.kind
‘The man drank wine of that kind.’
When perfect aspect combines with auxiliary or preverb constituents, verb tone
distinct from the imperfect occurs. Tone realization on auxiliary or preverb varies
according to perfect aspect type. In the Past perfect, an initial monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb shows downstepped high tone (ré', gbó') following a right edge high
tone subject phrase. Verb tone is high.

‘The man supposedly drank wine of that kind.’
b. ólí ómóhé gbó'
dá
ényó élìyó.
the man PAP.ADD drink wine that.kind
‘The man drank wine of that kind too.’
In the Present perfect, an initial monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb shows a high low
tone (i.e. H L, gbóò, máà) following a right edge low tone subject phrase. Verb tone
remains high.
(20) a. ólí ómòhè gbóò

ényó élìyó.
the man PRP.ADD drink wine that.kind
‘The man has drunk wine of that kind too.’18 | Orthography and grammatical overviewb. ólí ómòhè máà
dá
ényó élìyó.
the man PRP.CER drink wine that.kind
‘The man must have drunk wine of that kind.’
Verb phrases with multiple monosyllabic auxiliaries or preverbs show high low
alternation between adjacent constituents. The initial constituent retains its high
downstep or high low character according to subject phrase tone as Past or Present
perfect. Verb tone remains high.
(21) a. ólí ómóhé ré'
gbò dá

the man PAP.CONC ADD drink wine that.kind

b. élí ímòhè gbóò
gbà dá
ényó élìyó.
the men PRP.ADD COL drink wine that.kind
‘The men have drunk wine of that kind together too.’
Under prospective aspect, where there is no subject concord or high downstep,
monotransitive verbs show a nonfixed tone pattern. Prospective aspect is conditioned by the inherently high tone morpheme ló at left edge of a verb phrase. ló is
preceded by either a right edge high tone subject phrase in prospective Predictive or
a right edge low tone subject phrase in prospective Anticipative. Prospective ló conditions low tone in the immediately following constituent, be it verb, auxiliary or
preverb constituent. Verbs, regardless of whether preceded by prospective Predictive (PRED) ló with its right edge high tone subject phrase or Anticipative ló with its
right edge low tone subject phrase, evince low tone.
(22) a. ólí ómóhé ló
dà
ólí ényò.
the man PRED drink the wine
‘The man will drink the wine.’
b. ólí ómòhè ló
dà
ólí ényò.
the man ANTI drink the wine
‘The man is about to drink the wine.’
However, verbs nonadjacent to prospective aspect ló do not show low tone. When ló
precedes a monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb, tonal alternation occurs across the
verb phrase. Preverb che immediately following Predictive ló, for instance, shows
low tone while the following verb shows high tone.
(23) ólí ómóhé ló
chè dá
vbí ólí ényò.
the man PRED REP drink LOC the wine
‘The man will again drink from the wine.’Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 19Multiple auxiliaries or preverbs (che gbo) following Predictive ló lead to high low
alternation in the verb phrase and a high tone verb. Thus verb tone in prospective
aspect is nonfixed relative to perfect and imperfect aspect.
(24) ólí ómóhé ló
chè gbó dá
vbí ólí ényò.
the man PRED REP ADD drink LOC the wine
‘The man will again drink the wine too.’
Variable tone is evident in other constructions that also fail to assert the occurrence of an event. In imperative constructions, transitive verbs that occur clause
initially (following a covert subject pronoun with high tone, singular ú or plural vbá)
show low tone, as do verbs that follow Conative (CON) preverb òó.
(25) a. dà
ólí ényò.
drink the wine
‘Drink the wine.’
b. ólí ómòhè ó ó'
dà
ólí ényò.
the man SC CON drink the wine
‘The man went to drink the wine.’
However, transitive verbs that fail to occur initially in imperative constructions do
not show low tone. When a monosyllabic preverb precedes the verb in an imperative
construction, as with initial che, che receives low tone and the following verb exhibits high tone.
(26) chè dá
vbí ólí ényò.
REP drink LOC the wine
‘Drink from the wine again.’
Multiple auxiliaries or preverbs (che gbo) in imperative constructions lead to low
high alternation in the verb phrase and high tone on the verb.
(27) chè gbó dá
ólí ényò.
REP ADD drink the wine
‘Drink the wine again too.’
Tonal alternation in the verb phrase also characterizes prohibitive constructions
marked by a second person subject pronoun (singular é or plural vbá) and prohibitive morpheme è. Verbs that follow Prohibitive è (PR) exhibit high tone.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

4SPE focus position accepts the quasi-placeholder nouns émì ‘thing’ and óìà ‘person, human being’
under contrasting conditions. émì occurs when modified by a Relator li phrase (émí lì èsèn óò [thing

modified solely by the definite article (*ólí émì óò [the thing be] ‘It’s a good thing’, *ólí óíà óò [the

5As a final note, SPE óò often serves as response marker in riddles. Framed by the call and response

such as lì èsèn (ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óíá lì èsèn [the man SC NEG be person R good] ‘The man is not a good
person’). Similar behavior is shown by the quasi-placeholder noun émì ‘thing’ in class position. It
occurs only when modified, by an attributive phrase of evaluation for instance (úkhùè í ì vbì émí lì
èsèn / *émì [curse SC NEG be thing R good thing] ‘Cursing is not good’).
7Some common nouns, even when syntactically elaborated, are never acceptable in CMB assigned

[person the person person R bad SC NEG be farmer] ‘A / The person / The bad person is not a

nominal denoting a human social role. Resulting lexemes have the interpretation
‘one characterized by VERB LOCATIVE.’
òlàvbèhón ‘stubborn person’
la ‘to flow, discharge,’ vbi LOC, éhòn ‘ear’: ‘to be stubborn’2.4.8 Clausal synthetic compounds
Synthetic compounds of a distinct structural type form by lexicalizing an entire
clause. Lexemes of this nature are formed from verb or copular clauses or pronominally headed relative clauses. There are three classes.
One lexeme class involves a copula (COP) predicate and accompanying pre- and
post-copula nominals of identical phonological shape. Equational Identity copula
khi ‘be equivalent,’ pre- and post-copula position nominals, and Identity subject í
frame lexemes denoting indefinite, generic reference. They have the meaning ‘condition characterized by NOUN COP NOUN.’
émìíkhèmí ‘anything, whatever’
émì ‘thing,’ í ID, khi COP, émì ‘thing’
éghèíkhèghé ‘any time, whenever’
éghè ‘time,’ í ID, khi COP, éghè ‘time’
édèíkhèdé ‘whichever day, any day’
édè ‘day,’ í ID, khi COP, édè ‘day’
Lexemes of a second class denote a bodily condition. They employ the verb vbi
‘happen to’ preceded by the nonhuman noun émì and followed by the human noun
ómò. Resulting lexemes have the idiomatic interpretation ‘bodily condition characterized by NOUN VERB NOUN.’Classificatory synthetic compounds | 77émívbómò ‘convulsion’
émì ‘thing,’ vbi ‘happen to,’ ómò ‘child’
Synthetic compounds of a third class denote social roles deemed insulting.
These compounds are derived from relative clauses headed by relative pronoun
ólì/ónì. Lexemes of this nature have the interpretation ‘condition characterized by
PRONOUN NOUN VERB.’ The verb ne ‘pass’ used in some of these expressions derives from the neighboring Ora vernacular, as does the relative pronoun shape ónì.
ònìhóònè ‘one who farts’
ónì ‘one,’ ìhòn ‘fart,’ ne ‘to pass’
ònìsóònè ‘person defecating willy-nilly’
ónì ‘one,’ ìsón ‘feces,’ ne ‘to pass’
ònìvàngúé ‘shaggy rat’
ónì ‘one,’ ìvàn ‘grass cutter,’ gue ‘to nibble’
òlèkhòíò ‘shameless person’
ólì ‘one,’ èkhòì ‘shame,’ o ‘enter’2.5 Classificatory synthetic compounds
One type of synthetic compound serves to identify a referent with respect to its partitive character. Members exhibit a prefix+verb+noun morphological shape. Verbs in
partitive function synthetic compounds are sometimes difficult to identify synchronically. Today they occur as verbs with limited distribution or even as adverb or adjective forms that we assume derived historically from verbs.7 There are six synthetic
compound classes that bear on nominal classification.
One synthetic compound class is formed with prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun and
an elided form of the verb kpa ‘apportion, give equal amounts, divide’ (òjè kpá émà
ó vbì ìtásà [Oje PRP.apportion yam CL LOC bowl] ‘Oje apportioned yam into the
bowls’). kpa compound sense results from apportioning a nominal referent by isolating one part of its homogeneous mass or aggregate, any portion of which, when
isolated, is materially equivalent to any other portion.8 Lexemes in this class refer to
abstractions, locations (body part and otherwise), natural kinds and artifacts.
Abstraction:
úkpàtà ‘iota of truth’: àtà ‘truth’
úkpédè, í- ‘single day’: édè ‘day’
Body Part:
úkpédè, í- ‘strand of grey hair’: édè ‘grey hair’
úkpèrèè ‘drop of blood’: èrèè ‘blood’
úkpétò, í- ‘tuft of hair’: étò ‘hair’78 | Morphologyúkpéhìén, í- ‘fingernail, toenail’: éhìén ‘nail on the body’
Location:
úkpódè, í- ‘path, road’: ódè ‘way, pathway’
úkpòsé ‘bush path’: òsé ‘path’
Natural Kind:
úkpékèn ‘grain of sand’: èkèn ‘soil, sand’
úkpévbèè, í- ‘lobe of kola’: évbèè ‘kola’
úkpèvò ‘blade of thatch’: èvò ‘guinea grass for thatch’
úkpòhàà, í- ‘elephant grass blade’: òhàà ‘elephant grass’
úkpóràn ‘sapling, stalk’: óràn, éràn ‘tree’
úkpúgú'é ‘palm frond vein’: úgú'é, ígú'é ‘palm frond’
úkpáhíénhíén, í- ‘star’: áhíénhíén ‘star’
Artifact:
úkpóràn ‘stick, pole, club’: óràn ‘wood’
úkpìkhùnmì ‘tablet, small charm’: ìkhùnmì ‘charm, herb’
úkpébè, í- ‘sheet of paper’: ébè ‘paper, book’
úkpìsánó, í- ‘matchstick’: ìsánó ‘matches’
úkpótóòn, í- ‘rod of iron’: ótóòn ‘iron’
úkpòú, í- ‘strand of cotton, thread’: òú ‘cotton’
úkpúì, í- ‘piece of rope’: úì, íì ‘rope’
úkpémì, í- ‘bead’: émì ‘thing’
For some synthetic compounds with nouns of homogeneous mass, only the plural
prefix í- occurs. These compounds refer to abstractions, body parts, locations, natural entities, and artifacts.
Abstractions:
íkpìnyèmì ‘gossip’: ìnyèmì ‘issue, matter, discourse’
Body Parts:
íkpóòfò ‘prickly heat rash’: óòfò ‘sweat’
Locations:
íkpékò ‘spots in the market’: ékò ‘place, location in a market’
Natural Entities:
íkpèhìànmì ‘palm frond branches’: éhìànmì ‘peeling, peel’
íkpàtívbì ‘entangled vine-mass’: ívbìì ‘vines’
íkpésìrá ‘seeds of Piper gumensee’: ésìrá ‘Piper gumensee creeper’
íkpésè ‘clumps of gari or maize’: ésè ‘clump of pounded food item’
Artifact:
íkpàdè ‘retail items’: àdè ‘retail trade’Classificatory synthetic compounds | 79A second synthetic compound class consists of prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun
and the verb kpen ‘straighten’ (synchronically used only with the body-part noun
óbò/ábò ‘arm’ as direct object in a verb series construction with verb nyenye ‘push,
shove,’ e.g. yàn kpén ábó nyényé òjè [they PRP.straighten arms push Oje] ‘They
pushed Oje while straightening their arms / They shoved Oje with their arms’). Synthetic compounds with kpen have a sense in which a part results from a process of
straightening or stiffening a nominal referent. Process completion has the effect of
isolating a perceptually salient portion of a heterogeneous locus or aggregate, only
one portion of which is useable. Lexemes in this class refer to body-part locations,
natural kinds and artifacts.
Body Part:
úkpàgbàn ‘cleft of the chin’: àgbàn ‘chin’
úkpàkpó ‘part in the hair’: àkpó ‘path, track’
úkpátùí ‘anus proper’: átùí ‘anus area of the body’
úkpòè, íkpàwè ‘toe’: òè, àwè ‘foot, leg’
úkpóbò ‘finger’: óbò ‘hand’
úkpègèlè ‘penis’: ègèlè ‘pubic region’
úkpéhòn ‘earlobe’: éhòn ‘ear’
úkpùkhòìn ‘belly button’: ùkhòìn ‘navel and placenta’
úkpèò, í- ‘eyeball’: èò ‘eye, face’
úkpókòló, í- ‘larynx’: ókòló ‘esophagus, gullet’
úkpèvìè, í- ‘testicle’: èvìè ‘scrotum’
úkpùrìàì, í- ‘tip of animal tail’: ùrìàì ‘tail’
úkpèbì ‘gall bladder’: èbì ‘bile’
úkpètè ‘visible portion of a wound’: ètè ‘wound’
úkpé'túnù ‘lip’: únù ‘mouth’

úkpògán ‘tip of a spear’: ògán ‘spear’
úkpópìà ‘point of cutlass’: ópìà ‘cutlass, machete’
úkpùhàì, íkpíhàì ‘point of an arrow’: ùhàì, ìhàì ‘arrow’
úkpégàá ‘water channel joint’: égàá ‘water channel’
Synthetic compounds of a third class consist of prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun
and the verb so ‘achieve, make contact with an end point’ (òjè héén ólí ókòó só [Oje
PRP.climb the hill achieve] ‘Oje climbed the hill to its peak’). so occurs synchronically only in series with directional verbs to designate end point of a path of motion.9 Synthetic compounds with so have a sense that isolates the edible result of a
plant’s growth. Lexemes in this class refer to food items only.
Food:
úsúákògùè, í- ‘tuber of water yam’: ákògùè ‘water yam’
úsúémà, í- ‘tuber of yam’: émà ‘yam, raw or pounded’
úsùìbòbòdí, í- ‘tuber of cassava’: ìbòbòdí ‘cassava’
úsùògèdè, í- ‘plantain/banana finger’: ògèdè ‘plantain, banana’
úsúókà, í- ‘ear of maize’: ókà ‘maize’
úsùèkò, í- ‘ball of bean meal’: èkò ‘leaf wrap of beans’
A fourth synthetic compound class is fashioned by prefix á-, a post-verb noun
and verb buu ‘approach’ (ólí ékhìì búú ólì òkpòsò [the cripple PRP.approach the
woman] ‘The cripple approached the woman’). Post-verb nouns refer exclusively to
subinterval day-units. The entire compound denotes a transition into a temporal
period. These synthetic compounds thus refer to the onset of a subinterval day unit.
Time:
ábénwáà ‘dusk’: énwáà ‘evening’
ábódíánmì ‘early afternoon’: ódíánmì ‘afternoon’
Synthetic compounds in a fifth class are socially grounded. They are formed
with prefix ó-, a post-verb noun and verb kpo ‘visit frequently’ (òjè ó ò kpò vbí èvbò
[Oje SC H visit.frequently LOC there] ‘Oje frequents there’ / ‘Oje visits there frequently’). Morpheme kpo’s general sense ‘increase in size’ occurs in semantically related
adverbs: kpòí ‘swollen, plump’ and kpókó ‘swollen’. Synthetic compounds with kpo
isolate entities of a culturally awesome or powerful significance. Lexemes in this
class refer to natural kind, visual sensation, verbal expression and humans.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"
"‘do’ verbs | 461The direct object position immediately following u is severely constrained as to
NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. It requires a third person accusative pronoun, accepting singular (óì) or plural (íyàìn) forms. It never allows first or second
person accusative pronouns. Moreover, it fails to admit proper names or bare common nouns of any animacy value (*ò ú ójé / áwà / óvbèkhàn [he PRP.do Oje dog
youth] ‘He did Oje / a dog / a youth’).
(95) ò ú
óì / íyàìn / *mè / *é.
he PRP.do it them me / you
‘He did it / them.’
Direct objects for monotransitive u also restrict syntactically elaborated common
nouns. They reject human nouns (ómò) modified by definite article ólí/élí (*ò ú ólí
ómò [he PRP.do the infant] ‘He did the infant’) or postdeterminers such as áìn or ósò
(*ò ú ólí ómò áìn [he PRP.do the infant that] ‘He did that infant’, *ò ú ómó ósò [he
PRP.do infant certain] ‘He did some infant’).
However, u direct object accepts impersonal pronouns. It shows demonstrative
óáìn, ònà and ónóì (ò ú óáìn / ònà / ónóì [he PRP.do that.one this.one next.one] ‘He
did that one / this one / the next one’), universal quantifier èrèmé (ò ú èrèmé [he
PRP.do all] ‘He did all), existential quantifiers partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (ò
ú ósò / óvbèé [he PRP.do certain.one another.one] ‘He did a certain one / another
one’), and numerals, e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá (ò ú èvá / èvèvá [he
PRP.do two both] ‘He did all / two / both’). Unacceptable are kindred pronouns.
Noun phrase positions framed by monotransitive u differentially correspond to
discourse defined positions. Subjects correspond to li/ni focus or topic constituents
(àlèkè). Direct objects never correspond to these constituents.

Monotransitive u subject and direct object show contrasting interrogative pronouns.
Subject corresponds to question word óé' ‘who’ but never émé' ‘what.’ Direct object
corresponds to interrogative pronouns émé' and ékà but not óé'.

Responses to u questions about direct object require predicates taking agentive
subjects (e.g. la ‘run,’ gbe a ‘break’). Unacceptable are those taking nonagentive
subjects such as de ‘fall’ (*ìtásà lí ó dé' rè [plate PF it PAP.fall arrive] ‘It is a plate
that fell’), ri ‘be located’ (*ò ríì vbí ìwè [he PRP.be LOC house] ‘He is in the house’), or

interrogative pronoun, queries directed at u construction locative adjuncts require
verb za in series (Chapter 6, 6.2). Similarly, queries about manner adjuncts with u
require ébé' and manner preverb i/e (Chapter 6, 6.3).

Monotransitive u constructions are relatively unconstrained as to polarity and
mood. They appear as imperatives (ù óì [do it] ‘Do it’), prohibitives (é è ú óì [you PR
do it] ‘Don't do it’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù óì [the woman SC NEG do it]‘do’ verbs | 463‘The woman did not do it’), and polar interrogatives (ólì òkpòsò ú óì? [the woman
PRP.do it] ‘Did the woman do it?’).
u construction predicates manifest many properties typically associated with
verbs. Although they restrict verbal affixes, they do not limit verb inflection, auxiliaries, preverbs, postverbal particles and temporal adjuncts. Regarding verbal affixes,
monotransitive u rejects Perseverative prefix Ci- and Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no, as
in *élí ímòhè ú-ló óì [the men PRP.do-DS it] ‘Each of the men did it.’ Under bare verb
phrase conditions, however, u accepts Factative suffix -ì, as when direct object position is vacated in information questions (émé' ólí ómóhé ú'-ì? [what the man PAP.doF] ‘What did the man do?’).
Monotransitive u inflection reveals perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.

judgment types rational DED za (ólí ómòhè záà ú óì [the man PRP.DED do it] ‘The

‘The man didn't do it, did he?’) and bia (ólí ómóhé bíá' ú óì? [the man PAP.DUB do it]
‘Did the man actually do it?’) as well as assumptive CONC rere (ólí ómóhé ré'rè ú óì17
[the man PAP.CONC do it] ‘Even the man did it’) and HYP kha (ólí ómóhé khà ú óì
[the man PAP.HYP do it] ‘The man would have done it’).
Monotransitive u also permits relative tense, although Anterior ke requires a polar interrogative (ólí ómòhè kéè ú óì? [the man PRP.ANT do it] ‘Did the man do it464 | Be, do, happen and haveafterward / anymore?’), while Subsequent kpe does not (ólí ómóhé kpé' ú óì [the man
PAP.SUB do it] ‘The man still did it / did it despite pending conditions’).
In monotransitive u constructions, preverbs are partially limited. Although
manner-demonstrative ìyó and ìná are disallowed, u ‘do’ accepts phasal aspectualizers: Repetitive che (ólí ómòhè chéè ú óì [the man PRP.REP do it] ‘The man did it
again’), Durative se (ólí ómòhè séè ú óì? [the man PRP.DUR do it ] ‘Did the man continue to do it?’), Additive gbo (ólí ómòhè gbóò ú óì [the man PRP.ADD do it] ‘The man
also did it’) and Punctual ghe (ólí ómóhé ghé' ú óì [the man PAP.PCT do it] ‘The man
just did it’).
Monotransitive u also permits boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó (ólí ómòhè
ó ó' ù óì [he man SC CON do it] ‘The man went to do it’), Egressive mo, requiring the
Temporal Perspective particle (ólí ómòhè móò ú óì léé [he man PRP.EG do it TEMP]
‘The man almost finished doing it’), Ingressive ya (ólí ómòhè yà ú óì [the man PRP.IG
do it] ‘The man almost started to do it’) in addition to Past Absolute ya (ólí ómóhé yà
ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man used to do it’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí
ómóhé mó' ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man at one time did it’).
Monotransitive u allows most evaluative preverbs with the exception of woo ‘instead.’ u constructions are found with duu (ólí ómóhé dú'ú ú óì [the man PAP.EVAL
do it] ‘The man for no reason did it’) and kuku (ólí ómòhè kúkù / *wóò ú óì [the man
PRP.POEV PREV do it] ‘The man afterall did it’).
Not limited in monotransitive u constructions are temporal preverbs: kpao (ólí
ómòhè kpáò ú óì [the man earlier PRP.do it] ‘The man initially did it’), gue (ólí ómòhè
gúé ú óì [the man PRP.unexpectedly do it] ‘The man did it quicker than expected’),
bobo (ólí ómóhé bó'bò ú óì [the man PAP.promptly do it] ‘The man promptly did it’)
and tua (ólí ómòhè túá ú óì [the man PRP.hurriedly do it] ‘The man hurriedly did it’).
Monotransitive u restricts a few subject attributive preverbs. Ungrammatical are
dábo ‘deliberately’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’ Grammatical are dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò ú
óì [the man PAP.mistakenly do it] ‘The man mistakenly did it’), miti (ólí ómóhé mí'tì
ú óì [the man PAP.able do it] ‘The man was able to do it’), dúda (ólí ómóhé dú'dà ú óì

and dégbe (ólí ómòhè ò ó dègbé ù óì [the man SC C carefully do it] ‘The man is steadily doing it’).
Unrestricted in monotransitive u constructions are quantity preverbs. One finds
the forms dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú óì [the man PAP.REFL him do it] ‘The man did it
himself’) and gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú óì [the men PAP.COL do it] ‘The men did it together’). Intensifier quantity forms also occur, although each requires a detransitivized predicate phrase with partitive vbi: zemi (ólí ómòhè zémì ú vbì ò [the man
PRP.ABSI do LOC it] ‘The man did a lot of it’) and zeze (ólí ómòhè zézè ú vbì ò [the
man PRP.NABI do LOC it] ‘The man did a bit of it’).","[486, 487, 488, 489, 490]"
"18As well, human nouns that express generic reference such as óìà/éèà ‘human being, person’ fail to
take a li complement: *óíá lì kéré [person R younger] ‘younger human being,’ *ééá lì kéré [persons R

28Pronominally headed relative clauses also occur in Emai. They fail to show Relator li, and they are
headed by a relative pronoun denoting either an animate (ólí), inanimate (émé') or place (ébé')236 | Noun modifiersreferent (Chapter 5, 5.8). Relative pronouns uniformly show high tone or high tone followed by high
downstep.

29Deictic time nominals (òdè, ákhò and éènà) serving as temporal adjuncts (òdè in ólí ómóhé fí ólí

‘Yesterday when the man hit the dog with a stone was also long.’
30As a further note, ambiguity as to phrase head can occur in constructions with genitive phrase
and relative clause. In (i) relative clause head preceding Relator li could be possessum úríáí or possessor óvbéé; either could serve as direct object of shen ‘sell’ and thus as head of the relative clause.
(i) úríáí ísì óvbéé lí ójé shén-ì

‘tail of the monkey that Oje sold’5 Pronouns and conjunction
Emai pronouns express relations relative to linguistic or situational context. They
reflect five basic types: personal, bound (anaphoric), interrogative, locative and
impersonal. Exponents of these types can reflect case, person, number, gender,
and/or definiteness. In characterizing Emai grammatical structure, both overt pronoun and zero (gapped) pronoun prove useful.
Zero pronoun is illustrated by the syntactic position following the transitive
verb nwu ‘take.’ This verb is subcategorized for a direct object. nwu takes a pronoun
(e.g. óì ‘it’) in the absence of a lexical noun. In series with another verb (e.g. hian
‘cut’), as well as in other structural patterns, nwu also takes a zero pronoun.
(1) a. ólí ókpósó ló
nwú óì ní émè.
the woman PRED take it APP me
‘The woman will give it to me.’
b. ólí ókpósó ló
hìàn éànmì nwú ní émè.
the woman PRED cut meat take APP me
‘The woman will cut meat in order to give it to me.’5.1 Definite personal pronouns
Definite personal pronouns reflect person (first, second or third), number (singular
and plural), case (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and discourse status
(emphatic).

ìyáínA single sentence reveals the position of various pronouns. Tone on subject
pronouns varies according to aspect, mood, or polarity features of the clause (Chapter 3, 3.1.1). Tone can also vary on other pronouns as grammatical features interact
throughout a clause.

óì ní émé vbí íwé

they PF they PAP.take it APP me LOC house ASS your
‘It was they who gave it to me in your house.’
Restrained by case, number and person, personal pronouns refer to participants in
the situational or linguistic context. Third person subject forms (ó ‘she’) can co-refer
to a noun phrase in a preceding sentence.
(3) ólì òkpòsò míé
òhí. ó ó
vbì ìwè.
the woman PRP.see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
‘The woman1 saw Ohi. She1 entered the house.’
In complex sentences containing two or more clauses, nominative pronouns (ó)
express co-reference to a lexical antecedent (áléké) in a preceding clause. They tend
not to co-refer to a noun phrase in a following clause. This condition obtains regardless of whether the pronoun occurs in the main or subordinate clause of a complex
sentence.
(4) a. bí áléké ré'

míé òhí.
she PAP.enter LOC house as Aleke PAP.CONC see Ohi
‘Shei entered the house, when Alekei saw Ohi.’
For third person plural subject, e and yan exponents occur in complementary
distribution. Plural e tends not to co-refer to a noun phrase across a sentence
boundary; instead, it co-refers within a clause. In contrast, plural yan co-refers to a
noun phrase within or across sentences.
(5) a. élí ívbèkhàn yé
ògò. yán gbé'
ófè.
the youths
PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’
b. *élí ívbèkhàn yé
ògò. é
gbé'
ófè.
the youths
PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’
In addition, distribution of third person plural subject forms yan and e is controlled
by matrix clause aspect and structural position. Plural e is restricted to perfect aspect. It never occurs in clauses inflected for imperfect, as yan does. Plural third person e is limited to subject position relative to an antecedent in the same clause or
sentence; yan is not. When a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus,
antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix
clause inflects for perfect aspect, e or yan appears as subject.
(6) a. élí ívbèkhàn, é / yán gbé'

‘As for the youths, they killed the rat.’

‘The ones who are in the river are lost.’240 | Pronouns and conjunctionWhen a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus, antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix clause is inflected for
imperfect aspect, yan occupies subject position. e never does, as topic and focus
li/ni constructions suggest.
(7) a. ívbèkhàn, yán à / *é è gbè ófè.

they H kill rat
‘As for youths, they kill rats.’
b. ívbèkhàn lí yán à / *é è gbè ófè.

‘It is youths who kill rats.’
When the third person plural emphatic pronoun appears in focus or topic position
linked to a matrix clause inflected for perfect aspect, subject position accepts only
yan, not e.
(8) a. ìyàìn lí yán / *é

ólí ófè.

‘It was they who killed the rat.’
b. ìyàìn, yán / *é

ólí ófè.
they they they PAP.kill the rat
‘As for them, they killed the rat.’
Within S-complements (marked by Indicative khi for example, Chapter 13, 13.2.1),
subject position under perfect aspect accepts yan or e, with yan showing ambiguity
between personal (disjoint reference vis-à-vis subject élí ímóhé) and logophoric
(conjoint reference vis-à-vis élí ímóhé) interpretations. In contrast, e offers only a
disjoint interpretation.

Of the personal pronouns, only emphatic forms appear with postdeterminer
modifiers. Emphatic pronouns for each person occur with emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone.’ No emphatic pronoun, however, co-occurs with the definite predeterminer
(*élì ìyàìn ‘the they’).

‘I / you / he, she, it / we / you / they alone’Definite personal pronouns | 241Emphatic pronouns for third person singular and plural as well as first and second
person plural allow postdeterminers from quantity, demonstrative and attributive
classes. The third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts the greatest range of
modifiers. It is found with cardinal or collective numeral modifiers but not distributive or ordinal numeral modifiers.

contrastive évbèé).
íyáín èrèmé ‘all of them’
they all
*íyáín ésò ‘some of them’
they certainíyáín òdóòdé ‘each of them’
they each
*íyáín évbèé ‘others of them’

but not distal áìn or contrastive nóì.
íyáín nà ‘this very they’
they this
*íyáín áìn ‘that very they
they that*íyáín nóì ‘the next very they’
they nextThe third person plural emphatic never accepts kindred modifiers, neither deictic
élìyó (*íyáín élìyó [they that.kind] ‘they of that kind’) nor contrastive édàn (*íyáín
édàn [they different.kind] ‘they of a different kind’).
Relative to postnominal modifier types designated by a grammatical morpheme,
the third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts Relator li attributive phrases but
not relative clauses (*íyáín lí ójé shén' lí ókpósó [they R Oje PAP.sell APP woman]
‘they that Oje sold to the woman’) or Associative ísì phrases (*íyáín ísì òjè [they ASS
Oje]‘those of Oje’).
íyáín lí óbín' ‘they that dark’
they R dark242 | Pronouns and conjunctionThe third person singular emphatic pronoun is more restricted than its plural counterpart. As shown earlier, the singular form combines only with emphatic partitive
òkpá ‘alone.’ The singular emphatic fails to combine with numeral òkpá ‘one.’
ìyòìn òkpá ‘he alone’
he alone*ìyòìn òkpá ‘one he’

Emai subject position shows both an expletive and an indefinite pronoun. Expletive
o occurs in relation to an extraposed complement clause. Although an embedded Scomplement can serve as logical subject, it is obligatorily extraposed to clause final
position. Its grammatical subject position is held by expletive pronoun o.
(10) a. ò hùnmé
khì òjè gbé
ólí ényè.
it PRP.be.fortuitous IND Oje PRP.kill the snake
‘It is fortuitous that Oje killed the snake.’
b. *khì òjè gbé
ólí ényè húnmé.
IND Oje PRP.kill the snake PRP.be.fortuitous
‘That Oje killed the snake is fortuitous.’
Subject position also shows indefinite pronoun a ‘one.’ If not translated by the
English passive, it is rendered with indefinite plural ‘they’ or ‘one’ in active voice.
(11) á
gbé'
ólí ófè.
one PAP.kill the rat
‘One / They killed the rat / The rat was killed.’
Indefinite a never occupies nonsubject grammatical positions such as direct or indirect object, or discourse-defined positions like focus or topic.1Expletive and indefinite pronouns | 243(12) a. *ólí ívbèkhàn gbé
à.
the youth
PRP.kill one/them
‘The youth killed one.’
b. *òjè nwú

Oje PRP.take yam APP one
‘Oje gave yam to one.’
c. *à lí ó gbé'
ólí ófè.
one PF he PAP.kill the rat
‘It was one that killed the rat.’
Indefinite a is limited to subject positions subcategorized for human noun agentives
or experiencers, as grammatical gbe above illustrates. It is not licensed by stative
verbs (ri, da) or motion verbs (o, ye), which otherwise allow a human noun subject.
(13) a. *à ríì
vbì ìwè.
one PRP.be LOC house
‘One is in the house.’
b. *à dá-ì.
one PRP.be.tall-F
‘One is tall.’
c. *à ó
vbì ìwè.
one PRP.enter LOC house
‘One entered the house.’
d. *à yé
ìwè.
one PRP.move.to house
‘One moved toward the house.’
Indefinite subject a occurs with transitive verbs requiring experiencer subjects.
However, it does so only in negative constructions.
(14) a. á

b. *à één-í

one PRP.know-F IND the woman PRP.shoot the man
‘One knew that the woman shot the man.’
Indefinite a never co-refers across sentences, across clause boundaries within a
complex sentence or across clauses embedded within one another.","[260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]"
