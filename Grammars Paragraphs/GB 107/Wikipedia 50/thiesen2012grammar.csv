teha? o a:hi§è-thé-thm-(nè)
not I eat-go.do-neg-(n)‘I did not go to eat.’teha?(a) ‘not’ may be followed by the clitic -i ‘projected time’ (PT); in
this case the negation applies to the meaning of the clitic. For example, in
845 teha?ai (not-PT) denies that the event has already happened:1
(845) Tsahai dibye tsaatune.
teha?a-i [ti-p’è
teha:-thm ]-nè
not-PT that-(SgM) come-neg -(n)‘He has not yet come.’With postverbal subjects, there is no overt negative word (like teha?(a)
‘not’ in the previous examples) and the classifier subject occupies the place
o f -ne (0). Thus, two arguments for the claim that these negatives are sub­
ordinate are not available; the only available argument is that the first syl­
lable of the verb bears high tone (as characteristic of subordinate clauses).
Examples follow. In 846, -©:pè (SgM) delinks the low tone o f -© thm ‘neg’
in order to place its low tone on -thm.
(846) maxtfhó-thm-:pè (Majchótuube.) ‘He has not eaten (bread).’

‘He did not visit.’
‘They have not eaten

that the referent o f the phrase to which it is cliticized was or did what has
been asserted (or assumed) about it. The form -hi:§a is used at the end of
a sentence and -hi: is used within a sentence. -hi:(§a) may be cliticized to
verbs (13.3.1) or to nominals (13.3.2).
1This is consistent w ith the suggestion that teka?a behaves like a com plement-taking verb.",[361]
"13.1Negation with adjectives-thm (-tu) ‘neg’ may be added to adjectives (o f which there are very few)
to derive the opposite sense, e.g., i?tehmthm ‘strong’ is derived from i?tehm
‘weak’. Other examples follow; in 835a and 836 the tone is high on -thm
‘neg’ because the adjective is used as a predicate.

its first syllable and suffixing -© thm-ne (-tune) ‘negative-(n)’ or simply
-© thm. (-tu). We will first discuss cases with preverbal subjects and then
those with postverbal subjects.
With preverbal subjects, teha?(a) ‘not’ is added to the beginning o f the
clause, as in 837-840:
(837) Tsa dibye péétune.
teha? ti-p’è
phé:-thm-nè
not that-(SgM) go-neg-(n)‘He did not go.’(838) Tsa dibye majchotu(ne).
teha? ti-p’è
max$ho-thm-(nè)
not that-(SgM) eat-neg-(n)‘He has not eaten.’(839) teha? o a:?iBè-thm
(Tsa o aah+vetu.)
not I go.home-neg‘ I did not go home.’(840) Tsa dibye majchóityu(ne).
teha? ti-p’è
max$hó-i-tjhm-(nè)
not that-(SgM) eat-fut-neg-(n)‘He will not eat.’Three features of negatives suggest that negative clauses are structurally
subordinate clauses, complements to a higher predicate teha?a ‘not’:
1. low tone on the proclitic subject pronoun,
2. high tone on the verb’s first syllable, and
3. -ne (n) at the end o f the clause. Although this has been glossed (n),
it may be the suffix glossed (0) that is used in forming subordinate
clauses.
The structure of 839 would be as in 841:
(841) [v teha? ] [NP [s [NP o ] a:?i§è-thrn
] -nè ]
not
I go.home-neg -(0)
Further examples with preverbal subjects:
(842) Tsa o chéénetu(ne).

not I eat-neg-(n)‘I did not eat (fruit).’©2012 SIL International ®CONTRASTIVE NEGATION WITH - J I I V A ‘DENY’23.3.","[359, 360, 361]"
"12.1ConjunctionsBora has no word like English and. The conjunction o f nominals is
achieved by means of suffixes or by a “ summation” word as discussed in
section 7.6.
There are two disjunctive morphemes, ami ‘or’ and mitjha ‘or’, which
to our knowledge are entirely interchangable. They are used to ask which
of two alternatives is correct, occurring between the clauses that express
the alternatives, as in the following examples:
(818) iA u majchoó mitya tsa u majchóityune?
a m maxf ho-ó-? mitjha teha? m max$hó-i-tjhm-nè
yh you eat-fut-(t) or
not you eat-fut-neg-(n)a
‘Will you eat or not?’

ellipsed:
(8 2 0 ) iA u peéhi am f tsahaa?a m phè-é-?i

yh you go-fut-(t) or
this.SgM12.2‘Will you go or will
this one (go)?’InterjectionsThe interjections listed below express the speaker’s emotions or attitude.
They are never part of a sentence.1
uix ( uj) ~ hm?m:: (juhuu) expresses surprise
^hix (chfj) ~ $4:: (chff) expresses surprise or admiration
pó:o: (n ó ó o o ) expresses happiness
Many other interjections are used in the interaction between people:
to get another’s attention, to answer, or to indicate a reaction. A few of
the more common follow:
éhè (é je ) calls attention to look at something (like English ‘Look!’)
ahm (a ju ) calls attention to receive something given (like English ‘Here!
Take it!’)
aax (a a j) answers a call or indicates a question (like English ‘Yes, what do
you want?’)
hmmhmx (juujuj) ~ hmm (juu) ~ uiui ( uu) indicates agreement (like En­
glish OK.)
maa?mmx (m aah u u j) indicates that one does not know (like English ‘I
don’t know!’)
hm:m (juuu) indicates incredulity (like English ‘I can’tbelieve it!’12.3ParticlesThe PARTICLES listed below call attention, express surprise, ask permis­
sion, and so forth. In contrast to the interjections discussed in section
12.2, the particles are sentence constituents.
1H ow ever, they m ight be used at the m argin o f a sentence, much like w e m ight say in
English “ OK. I’ll go.”","[353, 354]"

' \go-neg-(n) J that-fyonderj-goal• that-(yonder)-goal ( go.neg. (n)The -© © nè, which has been glossed ( n) is probably the same suffix
as the one glossed (0). This would be the case if negative clauses were
complements to a negative verb (one which time has robbed of most verbal
responsibilities and privileges). This would not only explain the presence
of -ne, but also the fact that the initial syllable o f the verb o f negative
clauses bears high tone. For example, 236 above would structurally be
the following:
(2 3 8 ) [vteha?] [NP [s o max$ho-thm ] nè ]deny5.5I eat-neg‘I did not eat it.’(0 )Statements of factAnother sort o f sentence, one used to state a fact, consists simply o f a
subordinate clause terminated with - © ©ne (0). Presumably this clause
is the predicate complement o f an implicit verb be, the implicit subject of
which is something like fact. The first sentence of 239 illustrates this type
o f sentence:
(2 3 9 )Ó m ajch oróne. A ró n a a tsa o ó ó vetu n e.0 maxqno-ro-ne. A-ro-naa
tèna' o o:pe-tnra-ne.
1 eat-frs-(0)
thm-frs-while not I be.full-neg-(n)
‘ (It is a fact) that I ate. However, I am not full.’
This has the same feel as English It is afact thatl ate. Other examples are
816 and 817 on page 317.",[167]

Imperatives are discussed in chapter 14; this section deals with prohibi­
tions, i.e., negative imperatives.
-O (?)ti ‘prohibit’ indicates that the action o f the host verb should not
be done, forming a PRO H IBITIO N or NEGATIVE IM PERATIVE. -O ?ti (-h d i)
is used with monosyllabic verbs and -(L)ti (- d i) with polysyllabic ones. As
with (L)thm ‘neg’, -pe (n) may follow -(?)ti. These points are illustrated in
the following examples:
(856 )phè-^ti-(pè)
(jP eh d fn e! ~ jP e h d fi) ‘Don’t go!’

Subordinate clauses are negated with -(L)thm ‘neg’ but they never have
teha?(a) ‘not’ as in main clauses. In 861 negation occurs in a relative clause
and in 862 and 863 it occurs in a case-marked subordinate clause used as
an adverb:

2In 862 the first w ord has a long vow el, even though it is the subject. This is because
a subordinate clause intervenes betw een the subject and the verb; see the discussion that
accompanies example 635, page 270.","[363, 364, 365]"

which they are attached. Examples, in which the derivational affix is underlined, are given in 152-155:12

sew-(shelter)4.3.1Verbs derived from verbsMany verb roots are followed by a “ singular versus multiple action” suffix.
For each verb there are potentially six forms, corresponding to the param­
eters transitive/intransitive/stative and singular/multiple.16 The meaning
o f the singular versus multiple distinction depends on the particular verb:
sometimes it is individual versus collective action, sometimes it is a single
12Note that in exam ple 152 the derivational suffix -Pa is farther rem oved from the root
than the inflectional suffix -mm.
13The tones in isolation are: m fam m naa ‘people’ .
14The tones in isolation are: /t1a:pa/ ‘w ife ’ .
15The tones in isolation are teixk1o ‘ sew’ W e w ill suggest b elo w that cases like 155 can be
analyzed as relative clauses m odifying a classifier head.
16That is, each verb could have up to 6 derived forms corresponding to the cells o f the
follo w in g table. Rather than verbs, this table gives the abbreviations used to gloss the suffixes
that indicate these contrasts:transitive

The suffix -thrn(rn) ‘negative’ may occur between the root and the sin­
gular versus multiple suffix, as in 156:
(156) khé?'é-thmm-:Bè
(kéhyétuuuve) ‘become listless’
have.strength-neg-sln
mfia?-thmm-:fiè (uvahtuuuve) ‘be dumbfounded’
alert(?)-neg-sln
In this position, -thm(m) ‘negative’ is frequently preceded by -ra ‘frustrat­
ive, contraexpectation’, as in 157, but -ra does not occur in this position
without -thm(m).
(157) tfépó-ra-thmm-:Be (lléboratuuuve) ‘become deaf’
hear-frs-neg-sln
kpahakhm-ra-thumi-:3è (wdjdcurdtuuuve) ‘bewildered, stunned’

like, regard as’, - © O nm ‘do’, -:§e ‘become’, -the ‘become’, -§a ‘have’ or
-xkhimei ‘behave like’. These will be discussed in turn.","[141, 142, 143]"

ó imipax$ho-thé-hrnkhó:-?i
I fix-go.do-now-(t)‘Now I go to fix (it).’However this may be blocked by other lexically marked low tones. For
example, in 233 the verb sterns have a lexically marked low tone on the
antepenult, so - © © ? (i) (t) cannot doek its © on the penult:
(233) a. ó a:?i§é-?i(ó aah+véhi)‘ I visit.’b. ó amapmkhm-?i (ó amabucuhi) ‘ I hug.’
Sentence finally, the segments of - © © ? (i) (t) are both spoken and
written, as in 234a; sentence medially, the /?/ is spoken but not written,
whereas the /i/ is neither spoken nor written, as in 234b.10

whether declarative or imperative. It occupies the position - © © ?i (t) occupies in a nonnegative sentence. However, unlike - © © ?i (t), an explicit
preverbal subject is not required, as shown by 235:
(235) max$ho-ti-(pè) (jM ajchodf(ne)!) ‘Do not eat!’
eat-neg-(n)
Following -thm ‘negative’, - © ©ne (n) is optional:
(236)teha? o maxtfho-thm-(nè) (Tsa o majchotu(ne).) ‘ I did not eat it.’
not I eat-neg-(n)
In a prohibition, if -ne does not follow the verb, then a glottal stop
does,11 as in 237 (in which the glottal stop is not written):
10There is some variation, w ith younger speakers pronouncing less o f the segmental material o f this suffix than older speakers.

Example 959 begins “ I was gladdend” (not included in 959), followed
by an adverbial clause of the sort discussed in section 17.4.2. The verb of
this clause is “teil,” which has an object complement expressing what was
told. (The subject o f the complement clause is the noun phrase “ those to
whom I taught the truth.”) The structure o f 959 is given in figure 16.4:

bears high tone. However, the former imposes a low tone on its host’s
penult while the latter does not:
#ü...crane(0) (thing)
#a...aone(event)This difference is visible only on verbs that have three or more syllables,6
as in 962, in which the tone of the verb’s penult (/pa/) correlates with
whether the clause bearing -ne refers to an object (962a) or an event

"Why is Bora so interesting?
The Bora phonology is rich in nonsegmental phenomena. There is an elaborate tone system, intimately tied to both the lexicon and the grammar.
(An entire chapter is dedicated to tone, and it is discussed in virtually
every chapter.) Various phenomena are sensitive to syllable weight, and
perhaps conditioned by foot structure.
Morphologically, Bora is fairly agglutinative. There are many suffixes
and few— if any— prefixes. Many apparent prefixes are proclitics.
Typologically, Bora is an OV language. Evidence for this claim is as
follows:
1. Both Subject-Object-Verb and Object-Subject-Verb are common
word orders. Predicate complement clauses generally have Complement-Subject-Verb order.
2. There are postpositions, e.g., in the locative construction, but no prepositions.
3. In the genitive construction the possessor precedes the possessed.
4. Adjectives may precede the nouns they modify but it is more common
for the modifier to follow the head in an appositive phrase. (This is a
consequence o f the role played by the classifiers in forming referring
expressions.)
5. Auxiliary verbs follow the semantically main verb (which is structurally
subordinate to the auxiliary verb); see, for example, section 4.3.6.
Bora has a strong case system implemented by suffixes. There is an
interesting animacy-controlled inversion o f the direct object and recipient
(goal).
Perhaps the most outstanding feature of Bora grammar is the presence
o f a large number of classifiers and the various ways they are exploited in
carrying out reference. Strikingly, apposition— not constituency— is the
primary “ glue” for creating referring expressions.
In forming discourses, Bora has a remarkable system o f sentential con­
nectives, one that exploits the classifiers to provide great intersentential
cohesion.

THE INDEX:In the index, entries are ordered according to the English alphabet. Bora
words are written according to the Bora writing system (the “ practical
orthography”) to facilitate finding them in alphabetical order.
EXAMPLES:Examples generally present four types of information. The position of
these parts varies in the interest o f saving space. (1) The Bora example is
written in a phonetic or phonemic form using the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA). (2) The example is also written in the Bora writing
system, with this sort o f font (sans serif). This is sometimes located
above the phonetic / phonemic representation and sometimes following
the phonetic / phonemic form (in parentheses). (3) A
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss is given either below the Bora example or
in parentheses following it. (4) A free translation follows, either on a line
below the morpheme-by-morpheme text or following it at the end o f the
line.
BORA C ITATIO N FORMS:(a) Words given “ in isolation” (i.e., without any preceding or following
text) may meet the conditions for the application of either PLTS or FLTS.
If so, the isolation form will be the output o f the rule (which is how it
would be pronounced in isolation). (b) Sometimes the phonetic /
phonemic representation of words, roots, affixes,...make lexically
©2012 SIL International ®Conventionsx x x iiimarked tones explicit, as discussed below, while omitting the tones of
other syllables. (c) When verbs are cited, the phonetic / phonemic
representation may make lexically marked tones explicit whereas the
orthographic form gives the nonfinite form; see section 4.1, page 100,
especially figure 4.1. For example, akpakhumrn (awacunu) ‘to yawn’.
PHRASE MARKERS:Phrase markers ( “ trees”) with which structure is represented are
intended as suggestive, neither definitive nor what would might be
expected for any particular theoretic perspective. Some sentences are
given with a rather flat structure. This makes it easier to deal with Bora’s
relatively free word order, but at the cost o f sometimes obscuring
subcategorization relationships. For example, see the tree given for
example 662, page 277. Some affixes are treated as separate syntactic
constituents; for example, case markers are treated as postpositions.
TONE DERIVATIONS:The Bora forms in tone derivations are written as Bora people normally
read and write their language. Tone derivations use the font with
which this sentence is written.
LETTERS REPRESENTING USES OF TONE:We sometimes use v to highlight a high tone and v to highlight a low
tone. Further, to help the reader keep track of different uses o f tone, we
sometimes indicate the use by writing a small letter over the vowel.
These letters are as follows:

Enclitics (which we generally refer to simply as “ clitics”) have syntactic or
semantic “ scope” over an entire phrase. They attach themselves phonologically to the last word o f a phrase.1 Bora uses the following types of
clitics (among others, e.g., the personal pronominal subject proclitics of
table 10.1, page 270):
1. Second p o s it io n clitics occur only following a clause’s first con­
stituent; these include:
(a) TEMPORAL, i.e., ones that indicate tense (the time of an event rel­
ative to the time o f speaking) are -phe ~ -© o ‘remote past’, -(?)ne
‘recent past’, and -iikjhè ~ -i ‘future’. These are discussed in section
5.9.3. They are also included in figure 11.1; note that they do not
all occupy the same position relative to the other clitics.
(b) EVIDENTIAL, i.e., ones that indicate how the speaker came to know
what she or he is reporting; see section 11.1.
(c) The verb ‘to be’ ixkjha has become a second-position clitic in a type
o f predicate complement structure; see section 5.10.2.
2. ADVERBIAL clitics follow various classes o f sentence constituent; see
section 11.2.
3. A NEGATIVE clitic is discussed in section 13.3, page 13.3.
The clitics occur in the order given in table 11.1:
*W e do N O T intend a strong claim that the morphemes discussed here are strictly clitics as
opposed to suffixes. Examples like 790, in w hich -ro ‘ frs’ precedes -:pè -(S gM ), suggest that
-ro is a suffix rather than a clitic.","[337, 338, 339]"
"4.3.5Negative deverbal adjectivesThe suffix -thrn (-tu) ‘negative, without doing’, added to an active verb,
derives the adjective referring to the state of not having done or undergone the action of that verb. It is often in apposition to another noun or
pronoun, as in 188 and 189:
(188) 0 pee teene fmfbajchótuubére.
0 phé:-?i thè:-nè imipaxtfhó-thm-:pé-fè
1 go-(t) that-(0) fix-neg-(SgM)-only‘ I am going without
fixing it.’-ra ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’ often accompanies -thm ‘negative’, as
in the following examples. Note that in 189 the participle refers to the
subject o f maxf ho ‘eat’:
(189) Majchóratu u oomfhi.
maxtfhó-ra-thm m o:mi-?i
eat-frs-neg
you return-(t)‘You are returning without
eating.’In 190 max$hó-ra-thm is used as a predicate complement:
(190) a. maxtfhó-ra-thm thè:-nè
(Majchóratu teéne.)
eat-frs-neg
that-(0)
b. thè:-nè
maxtfhó-ra-thm (Teene majchóratu.)
that-(0)
eat-frs-neg
a,b. ‘That has not been eaten.’4.3.6Affixal “verbs”Some suffixes are like bound, complement-taking verbs. They follow a
verb root or stem, heading the verb + suffix combination. These suffixes
are: -teho ‘causative’ (see section 5.8.1, page 144),
O p hï ‘do to excess,
excessive’ (see 4.3.6.1 below), -^e ‘try to do’ (4.3.6.2), -phexteho ‘do upon
encountering’ (4.3.6.3), as well as the “relocation” suffixes discussed in
section 4.3.6.4.",[150]
"©2012 SIL International ®14.3. DEGREES OF STRENGTH OF IMPERATIVES14.3.1345ExplanationsAlthough explanations are not imperatives, we begin with them because
they can be interpreted as suggestions, that is, as very weak imperatives.
Explanations present the subject with either mm:nè (IndefAnPl) ‘indefinite
animate plural’ or mm?a (IndefAnSg) ‘indefinite animate singular’. The
verb bears the pronominal proclitic me- (m e - ~ m a-) ‘SAP’ and ends with
-?i (t). This is illustrated in 904:7
(9 0 4 )a. Illu muune nuhbake m éfm fbajchóhi.

b. ‘We (ex.) fix the clock like this.’14.3.2ExhortationTo exhort a hearer to some action, the pronoun mmm (m uu) ‘indefinite
animate singular’ is used as the preverbal subject. For example, 905a is a
declarative and 905b is the corresponding exhortation:
(905)a. U fmfbajchó d+hm++ne.
b. Muu fmfbajchó d+hm++ne.

thus clock-( 0) I fix -(t)

8Note that, because 906 is negative, the verb bears -n£ (n) rather than -?i (t), as in the

The words maho (m a jo ) ‘let’s (du.in.)!’ and métehm (m é ts u ) ‘let’s (pl in.)!’
are inherently imperative verbs (bearing high-low tone). They may be
used by themselves, in which case they mean ‘Let’s go!’, or they may have a
complement. The verb o f the complement verb is preceded by the pronom­
inal proclitic me ‘ SAP’ and may be followed by -(L)khi ‘purpose’. If the complement’s verb is clause final, -© khi normally occurs, as in 908 and 909.
If, however, it is clause medial, /khi/ is normally absent, although its low
tone is still docked on the preceding syllable (unless blocked by another
low tone), as in 910. The complement’s verb always bears high tone on its
first syllable because it is subordinate; this tone is not overridden by the
low tone of -©kM, as in 908 and 910.

When heading an adverbial clause, verbs so formed may be followed
by an adverbial suffix, and when heading a relative clause or nominal
complement, they may be followed by a case marker; see figure 16.1, page

There are distinct types of verbs, as discussed in section 5.7.
Tense (locating an event relative to the time o f speaking) is discussed
in section 5.9.
Aspect (the nature o f the event’s unfolding in time, i.e., whether it is
presented as occurring in an instant, as ongoing, as a persistent state,...)
is inherent in verb stems. Verb roots are frequently followed by a “ sin­
gle versus multiple action” suffix that— to some extent— defines the verb’s
aspect; see section 5.7.2.
©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 5. M AIN CLAUSES AND VERBS136Mood (how the hearer should take the content of the utterance relative
to his beliefs or behavior) is indicated in various ways. Imperatives are
discussed in chapter 14. Interrogatives are discussed in chapter 15.
Evidentiality (i.e., the basis on which one knows the information being
communicated) is indicated by clitics; see section 11.1.
Verbs can be modified by adverbs, which may be verbal suffixes
(5.12.1) or independent words (5.12.2).","[167, 168, 169, 170]"
"5.12.1.1-juco ( : ) ‘n o w ’The verbal suffix - © Ohtukho: ‘now’ is obviously related to the clitic
-OOhtukho ‘focus’ discussed in section 11.2.2. The difference is that the
verbal suffix is a temporal pointer, translated ‘now’, ‘already’, ‘still’ or ‘yet’,
whereas the clitic marks information as focal.
In some cases the event indicated by the verb to which -hrnkho: is suffixed happens at the time of speaking, so is translated ‘now’. See examples
285a and b, page 153; 543, page 241; 738, page 299; and 1062, page 405.
In other cases the event indicated by the verb happened before the
time o f speaking, as in 299 (where -hrnkho: is translated ‘already’) and the
negative, as in 300 (where it is translated ‘yet’). See also 222, page 129,
and 761, page 306.

that the action referred to by the verb does not fulfill its purpose, does not
turn out well, or was done in vain. When -?i (t) follows, -ra ~ -ja is used,
as in 301 and 302:

I eat-frs-(t)
(302) Ó majchóiyahi.
ó max$hó-i-ja-?i
I eat-fut-frs-(t)‘I have eaten (but not satisfactorily).’‘I want to eat (but
there is nothing to eat).’Otherwise, that is when -?i (t) does not follow, -ro ~ -jo is used, as in 303
and 304:
(303) max$ho-ró-mè (Majchoróme.) ‘They eat (but want more).’
eat-frs-(AnPl)
(304) Majchóiyóme.
max$hó-i-jó-mè
eat-fut-frs-(AnPl)‘They would like to eat
(but there isn’t anything).’The suffix -ra ~ -ro ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’ may also express an
unfulfilled desire (somewhat like a subjunctive):
(305) Uuma o pééiyahi.
m:-ma
o phé:-i-ja-?i
you-with I go-fut-frs-(t)‘I would like to go with you

Early Attachment. The analyses (given at the foot of the page) generally
favor early attachment. For example, the sentence in 1194a could be
analyzed either as in 1194b or as in 1194c:
(1194) a. ... baajurf me thtune mé nijtyuhi
b. ...[[manioc we peel] we wash]
c. ... [manioc [we peel] we wash]
b. ‘after having peeled the manioc, we wash it’
c. ‘after having peeled it, we wash the manioc’©2012 SIL International ®476APPENDIX G. BORA TEXTSIn 1194b, the direct object ‘manioc’ is attached to the verb ‘we peel’ and
then this phrase is attached t o ‘we wash’. ; hence [[DO s-V] s-V]. In 1194c,
on the other hand, the attachment of ‘manioc’ is deferred until ‘we peel
(it)’ has been attached to ‘we wash’; hence [DO [s-V s-V]].","[508, 509, 510]"
"2.5ApocopeMany morphemes apocopate one or more syllables sentence medially, the
full form being used sentence finally. Among these are the following: $i:-(?jè) ‘motive’ (compare 733 and 1051) with 734), -naa(akha) ‘while’,
-ax$hi:(hjm) ‘i f ’, -hi:(§a) ‘deny’, and -kpm(m) ‘very’.
Some morphemes are shortened even more. For example, when not
phrase final, -?aha (-haja) ‘challenge veracity’ may apocopate to -? as in
54a, -?a:kha (-haaca) ‘capitulation’ to -? as in 54b, and so forth:

The suffix -ne (n) is sometimes omitted following -thm ‘negative’; see
section 13.2 (especially examples 838 and 840).
The segmental portion of thesuffix -©kM ‘purpose’ is sometimes omit­
ted, as in 969, 908, 909, and1006. In such cases the preceding two sylla­
bles usually bear high and low tones (respectively) because the low tone
imposed by -©kM on the final syllable forces the penult to bear high tone
so as to not violate the *LLX constraint assuming the presence o f syllable
corresponding to -(©khi. However, this is not always the case for reasons
discussed in chapter 3.

/i/ is not pronounced (nor written), while the /?/ is pronounced (but not
written).20 For example, compare 55a and b:
(55) a. ó a?tó-?i
(Ó ahdóhi.)
‘I paid.’
I pay-(t)
b.ó a?tó-? ti:piè-khè (Ó ahdó dnbyeke.) ‘I paid him.’

verbal roots that— when not reduplicated— can bear verbal affixes. Oth­
ers are not verbs but can replace verbs: they bear no verbal affix (although
they can be the host for a clitic); the unreduplicated form refers to a sin­
gle action whereas the reduplicated form refers to iterative action (corresponding to the singular versus multiple action distinction of verbs; see
section 5.7.2).
The unreduplicated forms have HL tones; the reduplicated forms have
LHHL tones.21
Either [x], [?], or nothing occurs at the boundary between the redupli­
cated parts. Since we are unable to specify the conditions under which
these occur we simply give examples. In those o f table 2.5 nothing

“ Normal” conditional adverbial clauses are formed with -?ah$hi:(hjm) (hajchnjyu) ‘i f ’. These indicate that the event o f the main clause depends
on that o f the subordinate clause. Sentence finally -?ax$hi:hjm (-h ajch n jyu )

the main clause depends crucially3 on the truth o f the conditional clause,
(2) the conditional clause is false, and (3) therefore the main clause is
false.
The verb of the main clause always bears -i ‘future’ and -ra ~ -ro ‘frus­

Note that the order of the main and subordinate clauses is reversed in
977:
3This is generally a causal dependence.
4This requirem ent— that the main verb bear both the future and the frustrative (contra­
expectation) suffixes— negates the future possibility o f the event o f the main clause, thereby
givin g the counterfactual meaning.","[405, 406]"
"Thus, the suf­fix #CT...-©th®m (-tu) ‘negative’ imposes a high tone on its host’s initial
syllable, as in the previous section, as well as a low tone on the syllable
preceding the suffix (that is, unless the host is monosyllabic, in which case
the initial high tone prevails). See chapter 13 for further discussion and
examples.
The same is true for -hi:§a ‘deny’, as in 102. The verb akpakhmnm has
lexically marked low tones on its first and third syllables. The high tone
imposed on the first syllable overrides the lexically marked tone; the tone
imposed on the host’s final syllable docks on -©:pe (SgM). (See also the
tone derivation of figure 3.20, page 81.)

yawn-(SgM)-deny3.11Tone conflicts and their resolutionAs suffixes are added one by one to a root or stem, tone conflicts arise
when one low tone would be adjacent to another low tone (other than
word finally). This happens in three cases:
(1) The host’s final syllable has a low tone and the suffix has a low tone
on its initial syllable.
(2) The host’s penult has a low tone and the suffix should doek a low tone
on its host’s final syllable.
(3) The host’s antepenult has a low tone and the suffix should doek a low
tone on its host’s penult.
These are represented in table 3.2:

Imperatives are generally used to teil the hearer to do or not to do some­

14.1, various ways to modify imperatives in section 14.2, and degrees of
strength of imperatives in 14.3.
Imperative verbs bear the nonfinite low tone as described in section
14.1.1. Throughout this grammar, the nonfinite tone is sometimes repre­
sented with N over the vowel of the syllable that bears the nonfinite low
tone. In this chapter this nonfinite low tone is represented with I to remind

individual homes around the plaza facing the communal house. The new
town was named Brillo Nuevo.
For a time, the excitement o f reading, writing, arithmetic, and classes
for learning Spanish made it worthwhile to live closely together. Then
they began to realize that many changes were negative. There were too
many people, chickens, and dogs in one area. Women had to go farther
from the town to tend their fields. Game was soon depleted, so they had
to go farther away to hunt for their meat. And, while they were generally
loyal to their clans, they began stealing from each other’s fields.
Eventually, everyone except the chief and his family moved away from
the plaza on the hill, resettling along the river front. Some built their
houses farther away, yet near enough that the children could walk to
school. This reduced the concentration o f people and animals, but many
must still go considerable distances to make their fields and to hunt. Recently, they are making fields on closer land that was farmed 20-30 years
ago.","[38, 39]"

To this point we have not discussed -ne’s tonal properties. -ne (event)
seems to ( 1) impose a high tone on the host’s initial syllable and ( 2) delink
low tones between itself and the initial syllable, thereby making them high:
# @ ...-hne. However, it is not necessary to specify that -ne imposes the
initial high tone provided we recognize that the main verbs o f all sub­
ordinate clauses bear high tones on their first syllables, as indicated by
# @ ...-hne ‘subordinate’ in the tone derivation of i kpa:hakhm-hmkhó:-nè
in figure 16.6. Further, note that the low tone borne by -juco (:) ‘now’
is delinked but not the © that it imposes on the host’s penult. (Unfortunately, at this point we can not say which low tones -ne (event) fails to
delink.)

To this point we have characterized the difference between (0) and
(event) as semantic. But consider 963:©2012 SIL International ®16.3. - N E (0 ) VERSUS (EVENT)367(963) a. O dóóne u ajtyum+hi.

Is there any sense in which the sensory verb complement in 963a is less an
event than the adverbial clauses in 963b and c? (Here tone does not help
because the verb is too short.) The generalization seems to be this: When
a subordinate clause is headed by -ne and is a direct object, then this -ne is
- © ©ne (0). This—we assume— is the result o f subcategorization; that is,
verbs like axtjhmmi ‘see’ in 963a subcategorize for a complement headed
by - © ©ne (0). If this is correct, the tone difference is due to a syntactic
condition, not a semantic difference.
Returning now to the -ne (n) that follows -© thm ‘negative’ (mentioned
at the very start of this section), it may be desirable to identify this with
- © ©ne (0). There are two reasons. First, the tone is consistent; indeed
the © imposed by -thm may actually be the © imposed by - © ©ne (0).
Second, this is consistent with the suggestion that negative clauses are
subordinate clauses.","[399, 400, 401]"
"2.7.3Suffixes that add weight to a monosyllabic rootSome suffixes optionally contribute a glottal stop (?) to the coda o f a pre­

Thus, the choice between a personal pronoun and the anaphor may be determined by the (structural) distance to the pronoun’s coreferent: a pro­
noun if sufficiently far, the anaphor if sufficiently close.
Second, in some cases the choice between indicating a sentence’s sub­
ject with an overt personal pronoun, as opposed to using a classifier on the
verb, is determined by structural factors. For example, when a sentence is
negated with teha?(a) and -thm ‘neg’ an overt pronoun (or noun phrase) is
required, but if it is negated (contrastively) with -hi:(§a) ‘deny’, a classifier
subject is used; see section 13.3, particularly examples 850 and 851.
However, more generally the choice is determined by the issue o f topic
continuity:
continuity: A classifier subject on the verb is generally used when the
subject remains the same, as in the second and third sentences of
1043, page 398. Continuity can also be maintained by making the
subject a thematic connective, as in 1041, page 398.
©2012 SIL International ®236CHAPTER 8. PRONOUNSdiscontinuity: Shifting the subject from the currently most topical ref­
erent to another possible referent generally requires using an overt
pronoun or noun phrase. See, for example, the set in 1054-1056,
page 401. A special case o f this is to reestablish a topic that was
earlier put aside; see section 19.1.4.
Continuity is generally more frequent than discontinuity, so subjects are
more frequently indicated with a classifier than with an overt pronoun.","[268, 269, 270]"

b. kha:thm-m
(caatuu)
‘sweet potato (singular)’
c. kha:thm-m-:nè (caatuuune) ‘sweet potatoes (plural)’3.8The interaction of tone and vowel lengthThe tone bearing unit ( t b u ) is the syllable, not the mora. The basic toneassignment rules are blind to vowel length; they deal with syllables, not
moras:
1. They do not assign tone to a mora that is not a syllable.
2. Syllables are treated as adjacent (e.g., by the *LLX constraint) even if
a mora intervenes. For example, consider the tone derivation o f mé:m:§jè-:pè in figure 3.18:

PLTSmé:nï-:vye-ébefHe became a pig.’’Figure 3.18 TD: méénnvyeébe
The © that -©:pe (SgM) docks on the end of -©:§e ‘become’ is treated
as adjacent to the © that -©:§e docks on the end o f me:ni even though
a mora (length) intervenes between them; this is clear because the first
of these is delinked to meet the *LLX constraint. Note that in the deriva­
tion delinking is represented by “ = ” (equal sign). (For further discussion o f delinking, see section 3.11.2.)
Likewise, see the second derivation of figure 3.28, page 86. The mora of
the (SgM) suffix does not count as a tone bearing unit standing between
the © s o f the (SgM) and negative suffixes. That is, these two © s are
adjacent.
There is one— and only one— allophonic (“implementation”) rule that
links vowel length and tone, namely the phenomenon captured by PLTS
discussed in section 3.7.1. (FLTS is another potential candidate, but does
not seem to require that the final syllable be long.)
©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 3. TONE763.9The tones of isolated words ( “citation
forms”)The tones with which words are cited, that is, spoken in isolation, are often
different than the tones they bear when used in a context. For example, to
speak about a verb, the nonfinite form (see 4.1, page 100) must be used.
Theoretically, bisyllabic words might have the following tones: HH,
HL LH, or LL. All may occur in the context o f a sentence, but in isolation
bisyllabic words are only LL;18 for example, khmni ‘ arrowroot’, kpaxphi
‘man’, thaxkhm ‘agouti’, no?kho ‘ stork’, max$ho ‘eat, food’, titjhè ‘they (AnPl).
Theoretically, trisyllabic words might have the following tones: HHH,
HHL, HLH, HLL, LHH, LHL, LLH or LLL:
1. LLL and LLH a re im p o s s ib le becau se th e y v io la t e th e *LLX constraint.
2. HLH, LHH, and HHH do not occur in isolation because the final syllable
would become low by FDLT. The first two would become HLL and LHL,
respectively. The last would become HHL, which would then become
HHL.H by FLTS.
3. Words with HHL tones undergo FLTS, becoming HHL.H; for example,
amanaa ‘porpoise’, khana:naa ‘salt’.
4. The remaining two possibilities occur: HLL (e.g., m:§mkpa ‘deer’,
mmï?è ‘field’) and LHL (e.g., kpaxkhó?è ‘flowering plant’).","[108, 109, 110]"
"©2012 SIL International ®188CHAPTER 6. CLASSIFIERSAnother case is that o f mï-nè transport-(0) ‘canoe’. By itself, the root
mi- does not refer to a canoe; rather, it means quite generally ‘trans­
portation’. However, it does refer to a canoe when combined with -nè
(0), which (1) satisfies the structural requirement for a head, and (2) de­
notes a class o f objects, thus enabling the phrase to refer.12
5. It might be possible to formulate an argument against the claim that
classifiers head their phrases based on the remarkable behavior of clas­
sifiers with numeral phrases.
When a numeral phrase is used to quantify a noun, that noun must agree
in animacy, gender and number. For example, consider 478, page 218.
The phrase that means ‘six’ ends with an animate, singular, masculine
classifier because ‘ six’ is literally ‘one from this hand’. When this phrase
quantifies a noun (phrase), it must agree in animacy, number and gen­
der. Thus, in ‘six dogs’— contrary to what one might expect— ‘dogs’ is
marked as singular and masculine. See section 7.7.2 for further discussion. However, this lends further support for the claim that classifiers
head their phrases. What matters are the features of the the numeral
phrase and the noun, which are precisely the features of the classifiers
with which each ends. That is, the classifiers determine the features of
their phrase, even though these features do not reflect the semantics of
the expression.
To conclude this section (6.3), it should be clear that Bora classifiers
are eminently nominal. Here we have made a stronger claim: that Bora
classifiers are nouns. By doing so, it follows that Bora classifiers should
share the major properties o f nouns: the types o f meanings they encode,
the grammatical functions they may have, their distribution/use, and so
forth. Indeed, they do except that they have a more restricted distribu­
tion than other nouns. And this restricted distribution is due to a simple
property: that they are bound.
Based on the claim that Bora classifiers are nouns, it seems reasonable
to think that what have been called “ classifiers” in Bora are not really
such, but simply a subclass o f nouns. We will not try to resolve this issue
here because the answer depends on whether one believes in universal
category definitions or that ultimately each category must be defined for
each language.","[221, 222]"

A Bora word is composed o f a root and zero or more affixes, either suffixes,
prefixes, or both. (There are more suffixes than prefixes.) As affixes are
(cyclically) added, they affect the root or stem to which they are attached,
particularly its tones.
There are various classes o f words; these are treated in three main
groups. Those that are verbal are dealt with in section 5.6. Those belonging to various minor categories are dealt with in chapter 12. Those that
are nominal are dealt with in chapters 7 (nouns) and 8 (pronouns).
Inflection is discussed in other sections o f this grammar (for example,
section 5.2 for verbs and 7.3 for nouns). The most common notions expressed by inflection in Bora are:
singular, dual, plural. For example, kpatfé:-mm ‘women’ from
kpa^e ‘woman’ and -mm ‘plural’.
GENDER: masculine, feminine. For example, m a x^ ho - f è ‘ She ate.’ from
maxf ho ‘eat’ and -©$e (SgF).
AN IM AC Y: animate, inanimate. For example, maxtfhó-mè ‘They (AnPl)
ate.’
NUMBER:Inflectional affixes may also indicate adverbial notions, as in 122:
(122) a. ikjho:kha-rè
(ic y o o c a r é ) ‘right now’
now-only
b. tha-hmkho-:pè (T a ju c o ó b e .) ‘He cries now.’
cry-now-(SgM)
This chapter deals with derivation. We discuss four types: derivation
by tone modification (4.1), compounding (4.2), affixal derivation (4.3),
and the incorporation o f instruments into verbs (4.4).
©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 4. WORD FORMATION1004.1Derivation with tone: nonfinite verbsFor every verb there is (at least potentially) a nonfinite form; this may
refer to objects, actions, events or states. The nonfinite form o f a verb is
derived by placing a low tone on a particular syllable. To make this low
tone more evident we will sometimes represent it with a N over the vowel
(where N stands for ‘nonfinite’). For example, compare the finite verb of
123a with the nonfinite form in 123b:
(123) a. ó ixtehamèi-?i (Ó tjtsamefhi.) ‘I think.’
b.ixtehaméi(tjtsaméi)(finite)‘thought, thinking’ (nonfinite)The rule for deriving nonfinite verbs imposes a low tone according to the
following rule: If the verb is mono- or bisyllabic, the low tone is placed on
the initial syllable; if the verb is any longer, the low tone is placed on the
antepenult. In a nutshell, it is “ a low tone regressive to the antepenult.”
This rule can be formalized as follows:1
[finite verb • • •ü (CT (CT)) ]tl[nonfinite verb***® (^ (^ )) ]Figure 4.1 Nonfinite tone
Nonfinite forms behave like nouns: they may take nominal affixes; they
may head noun phrases; they may possess or be possessed (in the genitive
construction); and so forth. They are pluralized with -?apè ‘various’ rather
than with one o f the other nominal pluralizers. For example, the nonfinite
UN iform o f maxf ho ‘to eat’ may refer to food or to eating, as in max$hó?apè
‘various types of food’.2
Additional examples follow.
(124) a. mkpa:po-:pè
teach-(SgM)(Uwaaboóbe.) ‘He teaches.’b. mkpa:po-:pè
(uwaaboóbe) ‘the teacher’
teaching-(SgM)
1This is a lexical rule and the nonfinite tone is lexically marked. Tentatively, the V and N
subscripted to the leftbra ces represent [+ v e rb a l, + fin ite , —nom inal] and [ —verbal, —finite,
+ n o m in a l], respectively.
2This is w ritten m ajchóhane but is arguably a genitive construction: max^1ó © ?apè. Its
head, ?apè, ‘various’ refers to collections and thus “ pluralizes.”","[132, 133, 134]"
"©2012 SIL International ®©2012 SIL International ®Chapter 3Tone
Tone plays a major role in the Bora language. (One indication o f this is that
messages can be communicated by beating the tones on large hollow-log
drums; see section 1.8.) There are minimal pairs showing that tone may
be the only difference between lexical items or grammatical constructions.
For example, the only difference between 66a and b is in the tone o f the
first syllable. (Note: in the Bora writing system, high tone is written as an
acute accent, while low tone is not written.)
(66) a. a:-nè max$ho-:pè (Aane majchoóbe.)
‘He atethat.’
b. a:-nè max$ho-:pè (Aane majchoóbe.) ‘Then he ate.’
The only difference between 67a and b is in the tone of the second syllable:
(67) a. a:nm o:?i:piè (aanu oohnbye) ‘This one (SgM) is a dog.’
b. a:nm o:?i:piè (aanu oohnbye) ‘his dog’
Further consider imi ‘good’, cited here in the nonfinite form with two low
tones. When it occurs as the head of a genitive construction, as in 68, it
bears high-low tones:
(68) ti-ip’e
imi (dnbye fmi) ‘his goodness’
that-(SgM} good
When it is a predicate adjective, as in 69, it bears high tone on both
syllables:
(69)im i oó (Im f oó.)
good I‘ la m good.’ or
‘ I am in good health.’When it is a verb, its tones vary depending on what suffixes follow; compare 70a and 70b:
©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 3. TONE56(70) a. ó imi-?i
(Ó imfhi.)
I be.good-(t}
b. ïmi-ip’è

be.good-(SgM}‘I am good.’ or

‘He is good.’ or
‘He is in good health.’Note that the penultimate vowel o f 70b is given as a single long vowel
in the morphemic form but as if (bisyllabic1) according to the Bora writing
system, which more closely represents the spoken form. The difference is
due to the application of PLTS, a rule discussed in section 3.7.1. This
convention is followed throughout this grammar.
Likewise, when verbs are cited, the tones o f the morphemic form and
the orthographic form may differ, as for example i?§èthe (thvéte) ‘to stop
doing’. The first representation shows the morphemic tone (here a single
lexically marked tone on the second syllable) while the orthographic form

This suffix occurs only with explicit preverbal subjects, as in 230a. It does
not co-occur with a classifier subject, as in the first alternative in 230b:
(230) a. ï:hm mmï§a-?i (I+ju um+va.) ‘The horse escaped.’

(231) a. ó $e:né-?i (ó lleen éh i) ‘I eat (fruit).’
b. ó i?§èthé-?i (ó th v e té h i) ‘I stop.’
8A theory that entertains some notion o f m ovem ent m ight consider (t) and (n ) to be
“ tracés” o f subjects that have been m oved to a preverbal position. This could be m otivated
by the follo w in g distributional facts: (1 ) (t) and (n ) never co-occur w ith a classifier subject,
presumably because they occupy the position o f classifier subjects, and (2 ) (t) and (n ) occur
i f and on ly i f there is an overt preverbal subject (pronoun, name, or noun phrase).
9This could also refer to “ their” house, i.e., it could be bound by the indirect object rather
than the subject o f the higher clause. The interpretation given in 229 is preferred because
‘house’ is singular. If, how ever, the object w ere plural, that is i ’ Wa ?apè (s e lf house various)

"©2012 SIL International ®Chapter 10Case and Grammatical
Relations
Case marking suffixes indicate the role o f a noun phrase (or subordinate
clause) with respect to the clause within which it occurs. Bora has the
following case markers: -0 ‘nominative’ for subjects ( 10.1), -khe ~ 0 (with
animate and inanimate phrases, respectively) ‘direct object’ ( 10.2),
‘goal’ or ‘theme’ (10.3), -thm ‘source’ (10.4), -fi ‘inanimate obliques’ (10.5),
-ma ‘with’ (10.6), and -$i:?è ‘motive’ (10.7). In addition to these, there are
two “ pseudo-cases”: -?tm ‘comparative’ (10.8) and -x ‘vocative’ (10.9).
Some of the case-marking alternatives are illustrated in 625. 625a has
a singular transitive verb whereas 625b-d have an intransitive verb.

exception is discussed below.) Subjects are recognized by the absence of
another case marker, by their position in the sentence, or by the classifier
suffixed to the verb.
There are three possible patterns for the subject and predicate, as rep­
resented in 626a, b, and d:
(626) a.","[300, 301, 302]"
"5.1Basic sentence structureThe basic clause has a subject and a predicate, and the subject precedes
the predicate. For example, in 209 the subject is the noun phrase o:?i:piè
‘dog’ and the predicate is the verb teï:nè ‘run’:
(209) (3:?i-:pié
teï:né-?i (O ohn bye ds+tnéhi.) ‘The d og runs.’
d o g - ( SgM ) run-(t)
The subject may be a free, preverbal pronoun, as in 210:©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 5. M AIN CLAUSES AND VERBS126(210)a:nm $hèmé-?i (A an u ch em éh i.) ‘This one (SgM) is sick.’
this be.ill-(t)
A clause may contain many other phrases, the order of which may vary
considerably. (This word-order flexibility is undoubtedly due to Bora’s
healthy case system.)
When the subject is an overt, preverbal pronoun, if it is either first or
second person and either dual or plural, then the verb bears the proclitic
me ~ ma1 ‘nonsingular speech-act participants’, which will be glossed SAP.
For example, in 211 the subject is first person plural exclusive (that is, it
does not include the hearer); in both the conditional and the main clause
the verb bears me ‘ SAP’:
(2 1 1 )f mf muha m ecu w aca tsa muha m echém étu róhi.
im i? m m ?a mè khrnkpa-khagood we.ex SAP sleep-CF
teha? mm?a mè ^hémé-thm-ró-?i
not we.ex SAP be.ill-neg-frs-(t)
‘ If we (ex.) had slept well, we would not have gotten sick.’
In 212 the subject is second person plural:
(2 1 2 ) im f amuha m ecuwahajchn tsa amuha m echém éftyuróhi.imi? amm?a mè khrnkpa-?ax$hi:
good you.pl SAP sleep-if
teha? amm?a mè $hémé-i-tjhm-fó-?i
not you
SAP be.ill-fut-neg-frs-(t)
‘ If you (pl) sleep well, you are not likely to get sick.’
Of course, me ~ ma- ‘SAP’ is not used when the subject is third person;
compare 213 with 211-212:
(213) Im f d itye cuwahajchn tsa d itye ch ém éftyu róhi.

"©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 3. TONE94polysyllabic root: Otherwise the pronoun bears high tone. See ex­
ample 119.
Example 115 illustrates the first case (subordinate):
(115) mè kha?khmxtehó-nè (mecahcujtsóne)
SAP believe-(event)‘after you
have believed’Example 116 further illustrates the first case showing that negations behave like subordinate clauses:
(116) Tsa o majchotétu(ne).
teha? o max$ho-thé-thm-(nè)

clitic bears high tone as expected:

Ordinarily a noun— including its derivational and infiectional suf­
fixes— ends in two low tones. (This is not true for verbs, which end in a
single low tone.) For example, consider kpaxphi ‘man’ and ni:§mkpa ‘deer’

rA floating low tone occurs at the boundary between a classifier and its
host (that is, the morpheme to which it is attached). This tone is docked
by the following rule: (1) Monosyllabic classifiers doek a low tone on their
host’s final syllable. (2) Bisyllabic classifiers doek a low tone on the final
syllable o f a polysyllabic host. After a monosyllabic host, the low tone
docks on the classifier’s initial syllable. (3) Classifiers having more than
two syllables bear the low tone on their initial syllable. See section 6.1.4
for further details.","[127, 128, 129]"

question, but without really expecting an answer, that is, by a R H E T O R IC A L

cussed in chapter 18. Complements are dealt with here in section 16.2:
subject complements in section 16.2.1 and object complements in section

suffix’s tones. This is illustrated in the tone derivations of max$ho-thé-mè§ax, mmè?é-:nè-?apè, and m:§mkpa-m§m-ma in figure 3.6. (The underscore ties a tone to the suffix that imposes it, whether on the host’s final

1. The (l) o f -©teho (-tso) ‘causative’ is blocked by the root’s lexically
marked low tone. (In figure 3.7 the lexically marked low tone is indi­
cated by “ L” followed by “lexical.” Blocking is indicated by “ + ” on the
line connecting the root’s final vowel and the L brought by -©teho.)
2. The © of -© the ‘go to do’ docks on the host’s final syllable. The © of
-©teho does not block the © o f -© t1^ because the © of -©teho has not
docked (as just explained).
3. The © o f -© fo ‘frustrative, contraexpectation’ is blocked by the © of
-(L)the.
4. The © o f -©:pe (SgM) docks. The © of -© fo does not block it because
it is not docked.
If floating tones are not associated on the cycle in which their morpheme
is attached, they are never associated.
Strong evidence for cyclical tone adjustment can be seen in the second
derivation of figure 3.28, page 86: the © o f - © © § a ‘come to do’ may
not doek because o f the root’s lexically marked low on the initial syllable:
a:?ije ‘visit’. However, the root’s low tone is subsequently delinked by the
negative suffix and ends up bearing high tone.","[96, 97, 98]"
"©2012 SIL International ®1917.1. APPOSITION‘man’ is inherently animate, singular and masculine. The other noun
phrases share those features by virtue of the classifier -:pè (SgM).
Numeral phrases and other quantifying phrases work the same way.
For example, in 392 the numeral phrase teha?oxtehi ‘five’ combines with
the classifier -me (AnPl); this combination is followed by the appositive
noun (the animate plural suffixes providing the referential linkage):
(392) Tsahojts+meva wajpiïmu tsaahi.
teha-?oxtehi-mè-§a
kpaxphi:-mm teha:-?i

classifier:
(393) nè-:pé-§a-a
© [i
© $i:] (neebévaa fllif) ‘said his son’
say-(SgM)-rpt-rem
self
son
A noun may be in apposition to a pronoun. For example, in 394 tha:
kha:ni ‘my father’ is in apposition to the pronoun a:nm ‘this (SgM)’:
(394) Aanu taacaani tsaahi.
a:nm
© tha: © kha:ni teha:-?i

father comes-(t)‘This, my father, comes.’A demonstrative adjective is made a demonstrative pronoun by the
addition of a classifier. The noun it modifies is structurally appositive to
it.

above the relative clause is appositive to the subject of the clause (the
man); in 399 it is appositive to the direct object (the squirrel) o f the verb
(not given here); in 400, to the goal o f motion, and so forth:
(399) ...néépicyókevaa avyéjuube anuubeke...

The phrases in apposition may be noncontiguous, as in 401, where
max$hó-:pè-khé-hi:§a is in apposition to ti-:piè-khè. (See also 807, page
316.)

‘Why do you take him who has not yet eaten?’
A negative deverbal adjective may be appositive to a noun or pronoun,
as in 188 (page 116) and 189.
A few words,3 among them mitjha-nè ‘many’, function like prenominal
adjectives, as in 402:
(402) mitjha-nè kpa:-mjm
(mftyane waamyu) ‘many mosquitos’
much-(0) mosquito-pl
However, because these require the classifier -ne (0), the modifier and
head are arguably related by apposition rather than constituency; for fur­
ther discussion see section 7.8.I.2.

‘all’ .‘little, fe w ’, tu’ hè ‘little, fe w ’, p1fpa- ‘ numerous’, pka-©2012 SIL International ®7.2. NOUNS7.2193NounsNouns may be animate or inanimate. They may be singular, dual or plural.

There are three classes of nouns: concrete (7.2.1), abstract (7.2.2), and
locative nouns (7.2.3).","[224, 225, 226, 227]"
"Every clause must have a subject. If there is no classifier on the verb,
there must be a preverbal subject.2 Further, as in 626c, preverbal sub­
jects do not co-occur with classifier subjects;3 see the preverbal subject
constraint discussed on page 129.
Third, as represented in 626d, if the predicate is a noun or adjective
phrase, the subject usually follows the predicate, as in 632:
(632 )né?m(?) hm:§a (...néhnfjuuva) ‘ ...it is a bad trail.’
bad
trail
We mentioned above that there was one exception to the claim that
the nominative case is unmarked. As stated in section 8.1, when a per­
sonal pronoun is used as a preverbal subject, if it has a long vowel, this is
shortened. For example, ti-:piè tip’è, as in 633:
(633)Tsa dibye pééityu.
teha? ti-piè
phé:-i-tjhm
not that-(SgM) go-fut-neg‘He does not go.’This also applies in subordinate clauses, as in 634. (See also 864, page
332.)

‘If she goes over there, I want to go with her.’

2This is true in both main and subordinate clauses, although it may be that in cases o f
relativization into the subject, like exam ple 629, the subject is not overt in the m odifying
clause.

Clauses are either main or subordinate. Main clauses are described here.
Subordinate clauses are described in chapters 16-18.
A complete sentence has at least one main clause with a subject and
predicate. The subject may be either a postverbal classifier or it may be
preverbal, in which case the verb is followed by either -?i (-h i) (t) or -ne
(-n e ) (n), as described in section 5.4. A preverbal subject may be a noun
phrase or it may be a proclitic. The tone o f proclitic subjects is discussed
in section 3.12.2, page 93.
The predicate may be a verb or verb phrase, as discussed in sections 5.1,
5.2, and chapter 14, or it may be a noun or adjective phrase, as discussed
in section 5.3. Verb phrases are conjoined by simple juxtaposition.
How sentences are conjoined to form discourses is explained in section
19.1, page 395.","[157, 158, 159]"
"15.1Yes/no questionsYes/no questions are formed from indicative sentences by starting them
with a ‘yes/no’,1 as in 921 and 922. (See also example 955, page 361.)
