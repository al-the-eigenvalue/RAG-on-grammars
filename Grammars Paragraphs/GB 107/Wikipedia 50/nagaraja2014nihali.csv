"So, in the aspect of numerals both the languages are very
different.
4.2.8. Negative forms: Negation is marked by various forms; some
preceding the verbal root, some following it. In negative
constructions all the tenses are not marked: In non-past and past
tenses ho:to is used to mark negation. It can occur preceding or
following the verb.
ho:to-kappo 'does not/did not sleep', (kappo ‘to sleep’),
jo istan-ki e:riḍa:n engki ga:ḍi ho:to ghaṭa-jere
I station-to go-pt me-to vehicle neg. get-happen
'I had gone to the station, I did not get the vehicle', etc.
The other negative forms are the following:
beṭhe: hiṭe:moki nanika beṭhe pa:ṭho142The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyat this time anyone neg. come
'at this time no one will come'
ṭhawa:-be bhala cacomka ki beṭhe
taste -please
sweet or not
'please taste (&) see sweet or not'hayom: eṭey a:jyu hayom pa:ṭho
he even now neg come
'he even now did not come'.
biji:Negative imperative marker: a:pa biji ‘don’t weep’.","[152, 153]"
"114The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary3.12.4. Types of sentences:
(a) Existential sentences:
These sentences will have the main verb of ‘to be’ type. But in
negative constructions, as in (c) below, the verb for be is imne/imni
is used in positive constructions; while in negative constructions hey
+ beṭhe ‘negative form’ is used.
(199)(a) a:wa:r-sammaki mandir ḍa:n
house-front-in
temple is
‘there is a temple in front of the house’
(b)biya-kon paslaki para:y ḍa:n
village-of behind-to river is
‘there is a river behind the village’(c)paray-ki joppo imni/e
river-in water be
‘there is water in the river’ vs.
paray-ki joppo hey beṭhe:la
river-in water be neg
‘there is no water in the river’(b) Identificational sentences:
In this type of constructions no verb is overtly used. Placement of
two NPs sequentially makes a sentence. Here also it is possible to
obtain negative constructions using the negative form beṭhe. For
instance,115Chapter 3 / Grammar(200)(a) jo / do:ktar ‘I (am) a doctor’ vs. jo / do:ktar beṭhe ‘I
(am) not a doctor’
(b) iṭiko:l / guruji ‘that woman (is) teacher’ vs.
iṭiko:l / guruji/ beṭhe ‘that woman (is) not teacher’
(c) iṭimanso / korku ‘that man (is) Korku’
(d) herey / banjara ‘this (person) (is) a banjara’, etc.
(d) eṭey enge dusman beṭhe ‘he (is) not my enemy’(e) eṭey nani ‘who (is) he?’ vs. eṭey ḍa:kṭar ‘he (is) a doctor’
(f) uṭan na:n ‘what (is) that?’ vs. uṭan ka:kado ‘that (is) a
paper’
(c) Attributive sentences:
This type of sentence also does not take a verb/copula. Here the
attribute of the subject will follow the subject concerned. The result
is a complete sentence. Here also it is possible to obtain negative
constructions by adding negative form beṭhe, as shown below.
(201)(a)hi manso / masto
this man good
‘this man (is) good’vs. hi-manso masto beṭhe
this-man good-neg
‘this man (is) not good’(b) eṭlan a:wa:r/ mera:ki
his house near-to
‘his house (is) near’
(c)engen a:wa:r/ backa
my house small
‘my house (is) small’(d)hi a:ḍḍo / bha:ga lamba
this tree very long
‘this tree (is) very long’(e) ne /nu-san ‘how (are) you?’ vs. jo masto ‘I (am) fine’116The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(d) Possessive sentences:
In this type also except for verb imni(c)/imri(c) ‘be’, and ṭha:k- ‘to
have’ type; no other verb is used. Placement of two NPs
sequentially makes a sentence. Here also the negative constructions
can be obtained by using the negative form beṭhe, as shown below.
For instance:
(202)(a) a:ḍḍo-ki phu:l imric
tree-in flower be-np
‘the tree has flower’
(b) eṭey gida:r janwarṭa ṭha:ki
he many animals have-np
‘he has many animals’.
(203)(a)ra:m-ki / biḍi-ka bakko
ram-to one-only hand
‘ram (has) one-only hand’(b) dho:r-ki/ na:lku khuri
cow-to
four leg
‘cow (has) four legs’
(b) a:ṭo-ki / i:rbakko biḍi peñ
man-to / two hand one head
‘man has two hands one head’.
(c) a:wa:rki / biḍi-bi da:na hey beṭhe
house-at one-even grain be neg
‘at home not even a grain is’
(d) ha:n / nanin a:wa:r ‘this whose house ?’ vs. ha:n /enge
a:wa:r ‘this my house’.","[124, 125, 126, 127]"
"3.7.4. Aspects: Aspectual distinction is between present continuous
vs. past continuous formations.
Present continuous construction is marked by suffixing –kini to the
verb root form of the verb. :
(104)(a) kappo-kini ‘sleeping’,
me:r-kini ‘playing’
ekha:-kini ‘shaking’
(b) enge backa pirjo pa:ṭo-kiniChapter 3 / Grammar73my small daughter come-ing
‘my younger daughter is coming’
(c) hinkon e:r-e:r i:rghanta lagaṭini
here-from go-go two hour take-s
‘from here to go will take two hours’
(d) ceki ‘to catch’:
ceki-kin-ḍa:n ‘was/is about to be caught’
Past continuous construction (indefinite) is formed by suffixing
ḍa:n to the non-past verbal base.:
(105)
kappo-ka-ḍa:n ‘would sleep’
kappo-kini-ḍa:n ‘was sleeping’
Past perfect construction is obtained by adding –ḍa:n to the past
construction.:
(106) (a) kapp-i-ḍa:n ‘had slept’
(b) ...tongre wo:ṭo sa:ri-ḍa:n
…leg
size swell-ed
‘(finger) had swelled to the leg-size’
In the negative formations, two negative forms, beṭhe and ho:ṭo
are used. While the first one is used in non-past constructions, the
second one is used in past constructions. However this distinction is
not always followed. Also, frequently the negative marker precedes
the verb; while it may even follow the verb in a construction. (For
more details see 3.7.6.).
3.7.5. Moods: Modal distinctions are very few in this speech
variety. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood, marked by –be, in positive construction, and biji
in negative construction; and interrogative mood. As interrogative74The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularywords occur very close to the verb in a construction, it has been
considered as a modal distinction. Still, it has been treated
separately. So, except for these three moods, no finer distinctions
are available.
(i). Imperative verbal construction is marked by the suffix –be added
to the bare verb root.
(107)(a) ne pejko-be ‘you run’
laja-hela pejko-be ‘you all run’
laja-hela me:r-be ‘you all play’
(b) ne eṭen pejakkama-be
you him run-make-imp.
‘you make him run’
(c) ne baselhelan me:rokam-be
you children-obj play-make-imp
‘you make the children play’
(d) eṭeyki ca:y be-be
him-to tea give-to
‘give him tea’
(e) Sometimes without the marker as well, it is possible to
convey imperativeness. For instance, ne eṛe ‘you go’ (sg.) (> ne:ṛe).
Here the imperative marker is not used. Still it conveys a sense of
imperativity.
There is another form –ki which is used in imperative sense, though
not frequently. Its distribution is not clear. For instance, a statement
like hi pustakkon da:m kemti ‘the price of this book (is) less’ can be
converted into an imperative (request ?) one by suffixing –ki at the
end of the sentence, as :Chapter 3 / Grammar75(108) hi pustakkon da:m kemti-ki ‘reduce the price of this book’.
Similarly,
sokra asur-ki ‘(you) turn the sides of (a) loaf’.
In negative imperative biji is used. It can occur either before the
verb or after the verb. For instance: ne bije:r ‘you don’t come’.
(109) ne e:rbiji ba:kina ne:ki danḍa:ka hinka
you go-neg otherwise you-to fine-def will
‘you don’t go otherwise you will be fined’.
(ii). Obligative/compulsive construction uses a form la:y placed
before the verb, as in the following:
(110) ne eṛe ‘you go’ vs.
ne la:y eṛe ‘you must go’
(iii). Request/suggestive construction adds hona after the verb, as in
the following:
(111) ne:ki e:r hona ‘you need to go’/ ‘you are expected to go’
More will be discussed about it in the next section.
3.7.6. Negative forms: Negation is marked by various forms; some
occur preceding the verbal root, some following it. The negative
markers (forms) are the following: beṭhe, ho:ṭo, biji, hayom, and
bikhil. The last one is not frequently used. Probably it may be a
variant of beṭhe. In negative constructions all the tenses are not
marked. Among these negatives, while biji marks negative
imperativeness; beṭhe is used in non-past constructions; ho:ṭo is
used in past tense only; and hayom is used only in constructions
which express a sense of unfulfilled expectations.
A set may be provided as a sample.:76The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(112) a:pa ‘to weep’: a:pa biji ‘don’t weep’ (imp.)
a:pa beṭhe ‘does/will not weep’
ho:ṭo a:pa ‘did not weep’.
beṭhe: Used in non-past constructions. It can either occur preceding
or following the verb stem. Normally it precedes the verb in a
sentence; but it can occur after a verb as well, when the verb is of
predicate adjective type or equational type, etc.:
beṭhe occurring before a verb:
(113)(a) jo beṭhe ha:goken
I neg laugh-pr
‘I do not laugh’.
(b) nanika
beṭhe pa:ṭo
anyone/someone neg come
‘no one comes’.
vs. nanika pa:ṭoka ‘someone comes/ will come’
When this negative form occurs before a verb, often it comes
under assimilatory influences with the following verb. First of all,
the second syllable of beṭhe gets dropped; and the first consonant of
the verb gets geminated. It may be noted that it is optional, as it does
not happen always.
(114)(a) kyamp jo beppa:ṭo
tomorrow I not come –pr
‘tomorrow I will not come’
[beṭhe > dropping of 2nd syllable; and be- > bep /-p]
(b) inginki sokra bebbe

river-in water be neg
‘there is no water in the river’In the last instance above, a bound form –la has been added to the
negative form. But it’s function if any other than emphasis, is not
clear.
Also, sometimes another negative form from Hindi (?) bigar
‘without’ is used.:
(116)bigar joppoki nawki ji:wta:ken
‘Without water how (one) will live ?’ho:ṭo: In past tense ho:to ~ ho:ṭo is used to mark negation. So no
separate tense marker is used. It always precedes the verb. In the
process, the final vowel of it gets dropped in some cases, and in
some cases the second consonant of it undergoes assimilation
(which is optional) to the consonant of the next word.
(117)(a)
(b)ho:ṭo-kappo 'did not sleep' (kappo ‘to sleep’),
se ra:m a:wa:r-ke pa:ṭi/ho:ṭpa:ṭo (without assimilation)
yesterday Ram house-to come-pt /not come-np
‘Yesterday Ram came home/ did not come home’As can be seen above, in negative construction no tense marker is
used, while in positive construction tense marker is required. But it
can take aspectual marker -ḍa:n.
(118)(a)jo nene ma:nḍi ho:ṭcakni

'I had gone to the station, I did not get the vehicle', etc.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91]"
"In order to obtain negative indefinite forms a negative form is
placed after the indefinite form. For instance: nani-ka pa:ṭhoka
'someone comes' vs. nani-ka beṭhe pa:ṭho 'no one comes'.
Korku also has many negative forms. They are the following: heba,
ban, ḍun/ḍuka, athika, baw, baki and bangon. (For details Nagaraja,
1999). These markers do not show any formal similarity with the
Nihali forms. However their placement is very much similar to the
Nihali forms. They either precede or follow the verb concerned.
Secondly, in both the languages when the negative marker is used,
tense marker is not used.
4.2.9. Kinship terms: In Kinship area also we can observe
preservation of many terms in Nihali. In Nagaraja (2008), this topic
has been discussed in some detail. From that it becomes clear that
though some forms are similar to Korku, (due to proximity of the
Korku people), many forms are different. Here, the adjectives for
‘small/young’ is backa-, and for big/elder’ is bha:ga-. Also, there is
a term gita meaning ‘younger sibling’, male or female. Such143Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?common terms are very few. In this language also, similar to Korku,
a distinction is made between ‘self’s’ and ‘other’s’. The marker is ja to indicate ‘self’s’ whereas the other is unmarked. However, its
range needs to be ascertained.
In the following, a comparative list of kinship terms is provided,
restricted to those forms which are different between Nihali and
Korku.:Gloss
Child
Man
People (pl.)
Woman
Hu-Mo., Wi.-Mo.
Hu-El.Br.
Husband, man

Br-Wi.
So-So, Da-So.

Da-Da., So-Da.
Da-Da-Da, So-So-Da.","[153, 154]"
"6364The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyThere is another verb, a borrowed one, used for the verb ‘be’ hey,
very restrictively, in present tense in negative formation only. For
instance:
(86)(a) eṭey a:wa:rki hey-beṭhe
he house-at be-neg
‘he is not at home’
(b) eṭey hinki hey beṭhe ḍa:n
he here-at be –neg-pp
‘he was not here’
(c) parayki joppo hey-beṭhe
river-in water be-neg
‘there is no water in the river’
As can be seen from the illustrations above, hey is used in
negative constructions with the negative form beṭhe. The positive
construction would be: parayki joppo imni ‘(there) is water in the
river’.
jere(y) ‘happen’ is used as a regular verb to convert an active
sentence into an impersonal one. For instance:
(87)(a) hiṭkella minja:rki tagojagṛa jerey
they-between-obj quarrel happen
‘between them quarrel happened’
(b) uku:n ba:y a:ra kya:m a:ra uṭhwã-uṭhwã

one month-two months passed
‘so seeing today seeing tomorrow just like this one - two
months passed.’Chapter 3 / Grammar65(c) hinki kho:bo a:wa:jo cakni-jere-ka
here-at verymuch noise hear happen-s
‘lot of noise is heard here’
(d) engekon a:ḍḍoki ca:ka beḍ-jerey

‘I cannot climb a/the tree’ (= from me tree climb not
happens) [beḍ < beṭhe : loss of second syllable, +
assimilation.]
(e) kaggo moha:r pa:rka dhullaka jere:ya (jerey-i ‘pt.’> jere:ya)
face face (H) all dust-in happened (covered) =
‘whole face got covered with dust’.
(f) ho:-iṭin-ki ta:go jaghaṛa jere-kidani
there-at between quarrel happening
‘there quarrel between two groups happening’
(88)(a) jere can take ḍa:n, the past perfect form.:
dewta-budi-to-bi hayom jereḍa:n
sunset-even after neg happen
‘even after sun set (food) ready-not happened’
(b) engekon hekamay bekkamay jereḍa:n
by me this work neg-do happen
‘by me this work cannot be done’.
[be- < beṭhe : loss of second syllable, + assimilation]
A few verbs have varying forms between their imperative form
and in different tenses. For instance, the verb e:r- ‘to go’, in its
imperative form is eṛe; while in other tenses will have e:r-. (See
below for details).","[74, 75, 76]"
"Chapter 3 / Grammar117(e) Interrogative sentences: In this type, the interrogative forms
occur at the end of the sentence. For instance:
(204)ne jumu na:n
your name what
‘What is your name?’
(See Interrogatives section for details)(f) Negative sentences have been amply illustrated in sec. 3.7.6.
So, they are not discussed here.
Dative-subject constructions are found in this language, on line with
other languages of the area.:(205)(a) engki hi-biya masto
me-to this-village good
‘I like this village’
(b) engki hi-biya beṭhe masto
me-to this-village neg good
‘I do not like this village’

‘Dharamraja became thirsty’
(d) engki

'I (=to me) like sweet(s) very much'
3.12.5. Sentence patterns: Basically sentences are classified into
three types based on the number of main clauses it contains. It has
been noticed that speakers of this speech form either use either only118The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyactive voice or impersonal voice; but seldom use passive voice.
Also, very simple constructions are noted. If a sentence has single
main clause, then it is a simple sentence. Most of the illustrations so
far have been of this type. The second type is that which contains
two main clauses either connected by a connector or without it, is
called compound sentence. See below for illustration. The third type,
which is called complex sentence, contains one main clause and one
or more subordinate clauses embedded with in the main clause. The
subordinate clauses are obtained by converting a main clause by use
of a subordinator element, discussed below.
(i) Simple sentences: Already quite a few illustrations have been
provided for this type. So, a few examples for simple sentences are
provided here, which illustrate the word order, etc.:
(206)(a) tembrya dongor-ki bhum-ka
tiger
forest-in walk-prs
'tiger walks in the forest'.
(b) la
kaṭamkika kamayhona
you(pl.) silently do-need
‘you (pl.) silently should do the work’
(ii) Compound sentences: Compound/Coordinate sentences are
made up of two or more main clauses conjoined by an overt or
covert connector. Though normally three subtypes are identified
among the connectors, coordinate connector ḍo ‘and’ is more
common than others. The others are pine/i, pani, okon ‘but’, sorka:n
‘even then’, baken ‘otherwise’, etc.
(i) ḍo ‘and’:
(207)(a) biḍi-bakko-ki lakri ḍo biḍi-bakko-ki kanḍil koya…
one hand-in stick and one hand –in lantern taking…","[127, 128, 129]"
"The other negative forms are the following:
hayom: When this form is used, it conveys a sense of unfulfilled
expectation. It occurs before the verb in a construction.
(119)(a)eṭey aju hayom pa:ṭo
he even now neg come
'he even now did not come'.",[91]
"3.7.2. Verbal paradigms
In the following, a few verbal paradigms are provided. :
(92) A paradigm illustrates clearly: kapp- ‘to sleep’:
(a) ne kappo-be ‘you sleep’ (imp.)
(b) jo kappo-ka ‘I sleep’ : jo beṭhe koppoka ‘I do not sleep’
(c) jo kappo-ken ‘I will sleep’ : jo beṭhe kappo ‘I will not sleep’
(d) jo kapp-i ‘I slept’ : jo ho:to kappo ‘I did not sleep’
(e) jo kapp-i-ḍa:n ‘I had slept’ : jo ho:to kappo ‘I had not slept’
(f) jo kappo-ḍa:n ‘I am about to sleep’ :
jo beṭhe kappo-ḍa:n ‘I was not about to sleep’
(g) jo kappo-kini ‘I am sleeping’ : jo beṭhe kappokini ‘I am not
sleeping’
jo kappo-kidani ‘I am sleeping’
jo kappo-kidani-ḍa:n ‘I have been sleeping’
poye aphir-kidani ‘bird is flying’
enger aḍek-kidani ‘fire is burning’
jo a:pona la:w-kidani ‘I am burning the firewood’
(h) jo kappo-kini-ḍa:n ‘I was sleeping’ : jo beṭhe kappo ‘I was
not sleeping’
(i) jo kappo-ka-ḍa:n ‘I was sleeping’: jo beṭhe kappo-ka-ḍa:n ‘I
was not sleeping’
(j) jo kappo-kappo lawa:y ‘I got tired by sleeping-sleeping’.
From the above paradigm many aspects of verbal structure
becomes clear and it can be seen that sentences end in verbal
constructions. First of all, the word order is Subject-Verb in an
intransitive sentence. Here, the verb kap- ‘to sleep’ occurs after the
subject jo ‘I’. In a negative sentence, the negative marker normally
occurs preceding the verb. The verbal structure does not show any68The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyform of agreement with the rest of the sentence. The verbal
structure is pretty simple. The verbal construction carries tense
marker, aspect and mood markers in 'word' structure. The t/a/m
markers follow the verb base.
In a NP, adjective precedes the Noun. Similarly adverbs precede
the verb. Unlike other language families of the area, there is no
agreement in this language.
From the above illustrations various aspects of tense, aspect, and
mood become clear. (But some details of these aspects are also
discussed separately below). As can be observed above, these
elements are suffixed to the verbal root. The present tense marker is
-ka. The future tense marker is –ken (as in (c). The past tense
(immediate) marker is -i (d). If the root has a vowel finally, it gets
dropped before the suffix is attached to the root. The past remote
form is obtained by adding-ḍa:n to the past stem (e). The imperfect
form is obtained by suffixing -ḍa:n to the root itself. (kappo-ḍa:n
'about to sleep', as in (f)). The 'progressive' and 'present perfect'
marker is same. The progressive form is obtained by suffixing -kini
to the root/non-past form (kappo-kini 'pres. sleeping').(g, h). The
infinitive marker is -be.: me:r-be 'to play', ko:r-be 'to take'.(a). A
few verb roots do not take the infinitive marker. The verb root itself
will do that function. Context will make the distinction.
In the above constructions each positive construction has been
provided with the negative counterpart as well. It will be seen that in
many tenses not only the same negative form is used (except in past
tense); but even tense markers are not used in all negative
constructions (c, d, e above).
(93) Another paradigm: ie:r ~ e:r ‘to go’:
ne eṛe ‘you go’(imp.)
jo e:r-ka ‘I go’
jo e:r-ken ‘I will go’
jo e:r-kena ‘I will go’ (same as above)Chapter 3 / Grammar69jo e:r-i ‘I went’
jo e:r-kini ‘I am going’
jo seherki e:r-kini ‘I am going to city’
jo e:r-i-ḍa:n ‘I had gone’
jo e:r-ka-ḍa:n ‘I could have gone’ (my jaa saktaatha)
jo e:r-beṭhe-ḍa:n ‘I could not go’.
(94)ṭye- ‘to eat’:
jo sokra ṭye:-ka ‘I eat food’
jo sokra ṭye-ya ‘I ate food’
jo sokra ṭye-ya-ḍa:n ‘I had eaten food’
jo sokra ṭye-ya-ken ‘I will eat food’ (khaavunga)

‘oldman silently keep watching the finger and weep’.
(c) hi-khe:taki ke:le ḍo to:ri oro mekey kho:bpa:tuka

‘in these fields banana, tur, jowar, maize are grown

carry-pt (in his arms)3 and weep-ing (started)4.
‘(and) king running went1 and removed2 the mother (from
the stack) and took her in his arms3 and started weeping4’.
In the above instance, there are four VPs, the subject, ra:ja
‘king’ performing various activities in sequential order. They are:
cargokka e:ri ‘went running’, which contains cargokka ‘running’
non-finite verb and the main verb e:ri ‘went’; the other verb phrases
connected by coordinate relation are: a:yren phe:ri1 ḍo kaṭuy2 ḍo
a:pakini3 ‘mother-obj removed (from under the firewood); and
lifted; and weeping (started)’.

(so) she-herself (was) catch-pt1 and lift-pt2 and carry-pt3 and
pit-in put-pt4 and bury-pt5 and house-towards returning6
‘(so) she-herself was caught and lifted and carried and put
in the pit and buried and towards the house returning’120The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyIn the above instance, which is quite complex by having six
simple clauses, but without the agent overtly expressed; but
connected by connector ‘and’. Actually all are potentially simple
sentences. As this instance is taken from a text (narration), the agent
is expressed in the previous sentence. So here it is understood. In
the first clause the object is mentioned first, as in (kay) eṭeynaka
ceki1 ‘(so) she herself (obj.) was caught’, followed by four simple
clauses, containing only the verbs concerned, like : ḍo wocoli2 ḍo
ko:ya3 ḍo gaḍḍaki kama:y4 ḍo gaḍa:yi5 ‘and lift-pt2 and carry-pt3 and
pit-in put-pt4 and bury-pt5’. The last clause continues in the same
manner but the verb takes a different tense marker, ḍo a:wa:rhinga
wortakini6 ‘and house-towards returning6’; while all the previous
ones are in past tense.
The above three samples provide some insight into the sentence
formation in this speech form, particularly in narrations. These
constructions contain many verbal phrases or simple clauses
connected by the additive coordinator ḍo ‘and’. As could be
observed from above, often the subject will be absent, and even the
object is understood. So the verb finite form is used, which mark
various actions. All are sequentially arranged both chronologically
as well as temporally.
(ii) pini/e, pani ‘but’:
(208)(a) pini/e hisaharki joppo kho:b ghaṭajere
but that city-in water very much available
‘but very much water is available in that city’
(b) pine engki ajap ho:tdiso

‘but I could not like/accept this sight’
(c) uṭinki e:rhonḍa:n pani engekon hoṭol jere
there-to go-need-pt but me-from neg happenChapter 3 / Grammar121‘I was supposed to go there but coud not go’.
Even without the marker, it is possible to express this concept, as
follows:
(d) jo hikama:y kama:ken iṭikama:y jo beṭhe kama:y
I this work do (but) that work I neg do
‘I do this work (but) I do not do that work’.
Also, instead of pine, another form okon ((a) below) can be used to
express this concept.:
(209)(a) engki hici:jo beṭhe hona okon iṭici:jo hona
me-to thia-thing neg need but that thing need
‘I do not need this thing but I need that thing’.
(iii) sorka:n ‘even then’:
(210)(a) ṭla-ki da:m ghaṭajere sorka:n eṭlan dil beṭhe jere

‘he got money even then he did not have the heart for it’.
(b) khe:to imbrit sorka:n beṭhe kama:y
field exist even then neg work
‘even though field (cultivable) available does not work’
In the following the subject of first sentence is omitted, and the
second subject of the second sentence suffices.:
(211)enge a:ra:y ḍo baselhela a:pakini
me saw and children weeping
‘(children) saw me and (started) weeping’(iv) baken ‘otherwise’:
(212) iṭi sokṛa palti-kama-be baken rongoken
this loaf turnover-to otherwise burn-pt122The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary‘turn over this loafotherwise (it will) get burnt’Normally speakers avoid complex constructions. So, often a
complex seetence is converted into two simple sentences with or
without connectors.
(213)eṭey tye:-bi beṭhe ḍo ḍelen-bi beṭhe
he eat-also neg and drink-also neg
‘he does not eat and does not drink either’Without an overt marker also it is possible to place two clauses
sequentially, as follows:
(214)engekon hika:mo beṭ-jere /ha:n engekon beṭ-jamatinj
me-by thiswork neg-possible/ this me-by neg like
‘I cannot do this work (as) this (work) by me not
understood/ liked’.(iii) Complex sentences: Complex sentence, contains one main
clause and one or more subordinate clauses embedded with in the
main clause. The subordinate clauses are obtained by converting a
main clause by use of a subordinator element, discussed below.
The following complex sentence contains one subordinate clause
followed by two main clauses in coordinate relation.:
(215)eṭey dukan-hinga e:r-e saykalna karpi ḍo pejgi

‘he went towards the shop, sold the cycle and ran away’.","[129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"

biji: This form functions as a negative imperative marker, as
stated above. As can be observed, it can pecede or follow the verb.
When it precedes the verb, it sometimes undergoes some
assimilatory changes; while when it occurs after the verb no such
assimilation takes place.

In order to obtain negative indefinite forms a negative form is
placed after the indefinite form. For instance:
(122)nani-ka pa:ṭoka 'some one comes' vs.
nani-ka beṭhe pa:ṭo 'no one comes'.bikhil : This form is not frequently used. It appears to be a variant of
beṭhe. It can occur either preceding or following the verb.
(123)(a) jo beṭhe/bikhil ha:go

‘I do/will not laugh’

‘I can come anytime’
(b)jo hin-ki mi:-ka-bi eran pa:ṭoka
I here-to some-time come
‘I will come here sometimes’In the following, the formation of the indefinite form is made up of
myad + khenṭo ‘while’ > mikkhenṭo.:
(49)jo mikkhenṭo geyraki e:rka
I sometime slowly come
‘I come slowly sometimes’47Chapter 3 / GrammarWith din ‘day’ with the indefinite form becomes definite form, as
follows:
(50)
jo mi:-ka-bi-din sa:tocalomna bi:ka
I sometime+day 7Oclock getup
‘I getup daily at 7 O’clock’
When a negative form is added to the above formation, though
the formation is discontinuous, it becomes a negative formation. :
(51)(a)(b)jo mi:-ka-bi-din sa:tocalomna beṭhe bi:
I sometime+day 7Oclock neg getup-pt
‘I never got up at 7 O’clock’
jo mi:ka-bi khenṭo biki pa:ṭo

‘I never come’minga-ka-bi ‘somewhere’:

‘I will not go anywhere tomorrow’mi:n-ka-bi 'wherever/somewhere':
(53)
kyamp jo mi:n-ka-bi e:rka
tomorrow I somewhere go
‘tomorrow I will go somewhere’
From the above illustrations it becomes clear that by adding only –
ka to interrogative forms makes them indefinite; while addition of –48The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularybi to it, makes them doubly indefinite. But adding a negative form to
them, they become definite.
There is no relative marker in this language. Still, sometimes
speakers use jo of Hindi in this function.
3.4.5. Verbal nouns: Verbal nouns are obtained by placing a verb in
its root form after a noun with or without in dative case concerned.
For instance in a:ḍḍo-ki ca:ka ‘climbing tree’, the noun takes the
dative case marker –ki; as in:
(54)engki a:ḍḍo-ki ca:ka jan
me-to tree-climb
known
‘I know tree climbing’.","[56, 57, 58, 59]"
"70The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(97)(a) be:-ka ‘gives’ (as in: eṭey engki po:sṭo be:ka ‘he gives a
book to me’)
-ka is used as a present tense marker and as definiteness
marker as well.
(b)eṭey bekaṭa:rki jo:rda:r ba:ro:ka
she
very
powerful sing-s
‘she sings very powerfully’.(c) ro:jo jo beḍe-beḍe rupya okki-ka
daily I one-one rupee keep/save
‘daily I save one-one rupee’.
(d) hi-ma:w geyra pejakka
this horse fast runs
‘this horse runs fast’
But in a negative sentence, the tense marker –ka is not used; and
the negative form beṭhe is placed before the verb itself.
(98) (a) ro:jo jo beḍe-beḍe rupya beṭhe okki
daily I one-one rupee neg keep/save
‘daily I do not save one-one rupee’.
(b) jo a:wa:rkon kacra beṭhe ta:r
I house-from filth neg throw
‘I do not throw filth from the house’.
Present continuous/progressive form is obtained by using –kidani to
the present form of the verb. Also it conveys a sense of habituality
(as in (b)), as in the following:
(99)(a) nanaṭa ba:ryaki mer-kidaniChapter 3 / Grammar71Child-pl outside-in play-ing
‘Children are playing outside’
(b) ne minga:kon pa:ṭo-kidani
you hre-from come-ing
‘from where are you coming’?
(c)herey ta:go jaghara-kidani
they between quarrel-ing
‘they are quarreling among themselves’(d) poye aphir-kidani
‘bird is flying’
When an adverb of future time is used, it will convey a sense of
futurity.:
(100)(a) pa:toha:to jo e:r-kidani
comingweek I go-ing
‘I am going next week’.
(b) sewṭi nangay ḍo biyakon dhottana caraw-kidani
at last empty and village-of cattle graze-ing
‘at last (they) lost everything and started looking after the
village’s cattle grazing’
(c) uṭhwã:ki hiṭkelna po:po a:ga:n kama:-kidani
this-like their belly fill work-ing
‘this way their belly (would) fill-work-ing’
Past continuous form is obtained by adding –ḍa:n to kidani, as in
the following:
(101)jo kamay-kidani-ḍa:n
I work-ing-pt72The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary‘I have/had been working’
The ‘past tense’ is marked by the marker –i.:
(102) be:-i ‘gave’, as in:
eṭey engki po:sṭo be:-i
‘he gave a book to me’
pa:ṭi ‘came’, as in :
engki ca:ṭo pa:ṭi
‘to me hunger came’ = ‘I became hungry’)
With certain verbs, the tense marker is not overtly present. For
instance: jere(y): (examples below).
The past perfect marker is past marker –i + ḍa:n. Illustrations have
been provided above.
The future tense marker is –ken. With certain verbs, the initial kgets dropped, as in the following:
(103)dhi:ra maka ra:ja:n pabben
okay then
king-to tell-will.
‘okay then, (I) will inform the king’.","[80, 81, 82, 83]"

enjoy, spent all the money’
In the following illustration, the subordinate clause precedes the
main clause. The structure of the subordinate clause is somewhat
changed compared to the main clause, in that the object occurs after
the verb; while in main clauses the object occurs before the verb.
Also in this case the subormindate clause and the main clause are
connected by a particle kay. However, this kind of construction is
not very common.
(226) jo e:riḍa:n eṭeyna a:wa:rki / kay/ eṭey a:wa:rki beṭhe ḍa:n
I went his house-to so/then he house-in neg was
‘I went to his house then he was not at home’
Sometimes even jab ‘when’, from Hindi is used as a subordinator,
as in the following:
jab ma:nḍpa:ṭkini / ḍongor ni:la-ni:la di:soka
when rain coming forest blue-blue appears
‘when rain is coming forest looks green’.
Here jab of Hindi which is a subordinator has been used. The
subordinate clause precedes the main clause.
If the normal word order of a sentence is changed, from SOV to
SVO, as given below, without an overt subordinator, the first clause
becomes a subordinate clause and the second one, the main clause;
by that the whole construction is a complex sentence. For instance:
instead of jo a:wa:rki e:riḍa:n ‘I had gone home’, if becomes : jo
e:riḍa:n a:wa:r-ki, with the change of order, it becomes a
subordinate clause.
(227)(a) jo e:riḍa:n a:wa:r-ki / eṭey hey beṭhe ḍa:n
I went
house-to he be neg was
‘(when) I went home he was not at home’Chapter 3 / Grammar127Similarly,

kho:bo manta ḍa:n

‘(when) I came to this village first time lot of people were’
Quotative construction is obtained by using -ki as a quotative
particle:
(228)(a) kay ra:ja henni ki “engki dewtabuditañ goṭari ko:be”
so king said that “me-to sunset-till
deer bring”
‘so the king told (the hunters) that bring a deer to me before
sunset’.
(b) maka a:yrere henni ki “inginna pura burikamay
so mother(deer) said that “we totally coveredḍo ja:litakamay”
and netted as well”
‘so mother deer told (her family) that we have been
surrounded completely and netted as well’.
In the following the quotative marker –ki is not used, but it has the
same function.:
(c) maka ra:ṇi henni “ra:ja-ra:ja engki goṭari ka:w hona”
so queen said “king-king me-to deer flesh need”
‘so the queen said “king-kinng I want deer flesh”.
(d) kay hi-goṭari-kol henni “ho celli jo bi e:rka”.","[136, 137, 138]"
"In this speech form adjectives are not derived as such. However,
negative form beṭhe can be used as a prefix with some of the
adjectives to obtain negative adjectives. Interestingly here only a
prefix is used in this way. Some examples will make it clear.:
(152) bhum ‘sharp’(e.g.knife) vs. bebhum ‘dull’(knife)
nitto ‘sharp’(e.g.knife) vs. benitto ‘blunt’ (knife)
ho:si ‘consiousness’
vs. beho:si ‘unconsciousness’
diso ‘visible’
vs. beddiso ‘not visible’
ḍhang ‘proper’
vs. beḍhang ‘useless’.
It can be observed from above list, the negative form beṭhe > be-,
by retaining onlythe initial CV- and dropping the second syllable
completely. In some cases there is some assimilation with the
following consonant of the root.
3.9. Adverb(ial)s: The adverbs are those which normally modify a
verb in a sentence or construction. There are different types of
adverbs; like manner, time or temporal adverbs, place adverbs
which function more like nouns; and frequency adverbs. Most of
them are quite free in their occurrence. The following forms have
been found to be used in this function.
(a) Manner adverbs: Though manner adverbs in this speech form
do not take any marker as such, still some of them take a form –kiChapter 3 / Grammar95with them. Using it with adjectives, some adverbs are obtained.
Other than –ki, they are not morphologically marked. Only by the
place of their occurrence they are identified as such. They normally
occur preceding the main verb in a sentence. But they can occur
much before the verb, or even after a verb, as will be seen below.
Following are some of the manner adverbs.: geyra:-ki ‘slowly’,
jaldi-ki ‘fast’, masto-ki ‘nicely/beautifully’, jhaṭ-ka ‘all of a
sudden’, baro:bar ‘properly’, bageteka ‘silently’, marṭhay-ki ‘after
longtime’, etc.
ADV.-ki/ka + V construction:
(152)(a) hima:w geyra-ki pejakka
this horse slowly run-np
‘this horse runs slowly’
(b) jaldi-ki pya ‘fast come’ = ‘come fast’
masto-ki barowbe ‘nicely sing’ = ‘sing nicely’
jo:r-ki ma:nḍibe ‘loudly talk-imp’ = ‘talk loudly’
(c) marṭhay-ki

(d)jhaṭ-ka

‘all of a sudden poured’(e) pirjo bageṭeka ba:rya-hinga bi
girl silently outside-towards emerge-pt
‘girl silently cameout outside (of the box)’
-ki/-ka may not be used, as below:
(f) kusi-kusi ‘happily’:
eṭey a:wa:rkon kusi-kusi e:ri
he house-into happily go-pt96The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary‘he went home happily’.
(g) saltul ‘quietly’:
ne saltul peṭebe ‘you silently sit’
Sometimes a manner adverb can occur after the verb. Then focus
or emphasis is intended, as in the following:
(h) a:ra:y baro:bar
‘saw properly’
(b) Time/temporal adverbs:
(153)(a) ba:y ‘today’
dya ‘day’
minḍi ‘night’
phejar ‘morning’
a:ginkini ‘summer’
dewtabudi ‘sun set’ (= god set), ‘evening’
dewtaberki ‘sun rise’ (= god rise)
ciryen ‘at night’ (cirya ‘night’ + -n >
ciryen ‘at/during night’)
uṭni ‘day after tomorrow’/ ‘day before yesterday’ :
(b) enge guy

‘my friend came on day before yesterday’
canṭa din-ki ‘fourth day from today’, as in
(c) enge guy canṭa din-ki pa:ṭi

‘my friend came on fourth day from today’
a:jyu ‘now’:

Connectors: ḍo ‘and’, pini~e/pani ‘but’, ka:y/ki ‘so/then’, maka
‘so’, ḍoku ‘again/then’, uku/oku ‘so’, thari ‘again’, -bi ‘also’, etc.
Among these, some are dialectal variants and so restricted in their
distribution. For instance use of uku(n) is found only in one story,
collected from an area called Kuvardev; similarly ḍoku also. :100The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(i) Coordinative connector ḍo ‘and’:
(160)(a) sa:na ḍo ḍukri ‘old man and old woman’
hikama:y ḍo iṭikama:y
‘this work and that work’
(b) hi-khe:taki
ke:le ḍo to:ri
those fields-in banana and Tur
‘in these fields banana and tur’
(ii) Alternative Connector: pine/pini ‘but’:
(161)(a) pini/e hi-sahar-ki joppo kho:b ghaṭajere
but that city-in water very much available
‘but very much water is available in that city’
(b)pine engki ajap ho:tdiso

ocoljerkin
harisel king all money balance-in put-pt but neg rise-pt
‘Harisel king put all the money in the balance but the
balance did not rise.’
Even without the marker, it is possible to express this concept, as
follows:
(d) jo hikama:y kama:ken iṭikama:y jo beṭhe kama:y
I this work do (but) that work I
neg do
‘I do this work (but) I do not do that work’.
Also, instead of pine, another form okon can be used to express this
concept.:
(e) engki hici:jo beṭhe hona okon iṭici:jo hona
me-to thia-thing neg need but that thing needChapter 3 / Grammar101‘I do not need this thing but I need that thing’.
(iii) There are some other connectors sorka:n ‘even then’, kay ‘so’,
ki ‘so’, maka ‘so’, ḍoku ‘again/then/so’, uku/oku ‘so’, thari ‘again’,
which connect two clauses more commonly, than phrases, as
follows:
(162)

"60The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyA noun can function like a verb, by taking verbal forms, such as
kamay ‘to do’ or jere(y) ‘to happen’ or ca(:)ka- ‘to climb’ readily
converts a foreign word into a native one. Native verbs do not take
any of them mentioned above, they are inherently verbs, while
others need one of the above mentioned forms for their
verbalization. For instance: kama(y) is the most common form,
which also functions as an independent verb, but functions as an
auxiliary when occurs with another verb or converts a
noun/adjective into a verb. Further it is used with intransitive verb
to obtain transitive form of it (see below for it). For instance:
(80)(a) kamay: pata:r ‘dry’ : pata:r-kamay +-be = pata:rkambe ‘to
dry (cloth)’,
ila:j ‘treatment’: ila:j-kamay + -be = ila:jkambe ‘to treat
some one’,
ulṭa ‘up side down’: ulṭa-kamay +-be = ulṭakam-be ‘to
cause to fall’, etc.;
(b) jere(y) ‘to happen’: dil ‘heart’: dil-jere ‘to heart move’,
gelti ‘mistake’ :
gelti-jere-be ‘to commit mistake’
kama:y ‘work’ : kama:y-jere-be ‘to do the work’
(c) ca(:)ka ‘to climb’: ja:ra-cakay ‘fever climbed’
khi:jo ‘anger’:
khi:jo-cakay ‘anger climbed’
a:rsa ‘lazyness’:
a:rsa-cakay ‘lazyness came’, etc.
Verbs can be derived from nouns by using an imperative marker
–ki.: te:l ‘oil’ : te:l-ki ‘put oil on’. But this kind of formation seems
not to be common. Also, another method of deriving verbs from
nouns is to suffix the infinitve marker –be to the nouns, which is
much more common, as can be seen below.:
(81)(a) baro(w) ‘song’ : + -be > barow-be > baro:be ‘to sing’,Chapter 3 / Grammar61ca:na ‘dance’ : + -be > ca:na:-be ‘to dance’,
popa ‘hole’ : + -be > popa-be, popa-kam-be ‘to bore, to
make a hole’,
agin ‘sweat’: + -be > agin-be ‘to sweat’, ‘to perspire’,
phor ‘fruit’: + -be > phor- ‘to bear fruit’, etc.
Even an adjective can be changed into a verb in this manner.:
(b) bha:ga ‘big’ :+ -be > bha:ga-be ‘to grow’, etc.
3.7.1. Types of verbs
Verbs are normally classified into different types based on whether
they take an object or not. They are intransitive, where no object can
occur; transitive, and bi-transitive based on whether the verb can
take one or more than one object. Besides these, a verb ‘be’ belongs
to a different type altogether; and a few verbs do not belong to any
of the above types. A few illustrations follow.:
(82) (a) Intransitive verb, which does not take an object (= one place
predicate): kapp- ‘to sleep’, e:r- ‘to go’, a:pa- ‘to weep’,
pej- ‘to run’;
(b) Transitive verbs (= two-place predicate): okk- ‘to keep’,
ja:m- ‘to buy’, ber- ‘to cut’, be: ‘to give’, etc.;
(c) Causative verbs (= three-place predicates): paḍa- ‘to kill’,
etc.
(83) Incomplete verbs: These are incomplete verbs, in the sense
that they do not take all tense/aspect markers. : hona ‘need’, jerey
‘happen’, etc.
(a)hona ‘need’, when used as a verb, it occurs after a noun, with
or without a negative form. E.g.:(i)engki hi-ci:jo beṭhe hona okon iṭi-ci:jo hona62The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyme-to this thing neg need but that thing need
‘to me this thing (is) not needed, but that thing (is) needed’
(ii) engki masto ma:nso hona
me-to good person need
‘I want a good person’
(iii) ne:ki na:n hona
you-to what want
‘what do you want?’
Verb ‘be’ in present tense is imne/imni; and in past tense ‘ḍa:n’:
When it occurs without a verb, ḍa:n functions as an independent
verb, marking existence; and used more in past tense (particularly in
narrations); while when it occurs after a verb, it functions as an
auxiliary/aspectual marker.:
(84)(a) eṭla a:wa:rki imne
they house-in be
‘they are at home’
aju masto te:mo imne
now good time be
‘now is the good time’
(c) paray-ki joppo imne

‘There is water in the river’(b)(d)herey a:wa:rki imnic-ki beṭhe
hey house-at be
neg
‘are they at home?’(e)hi-sahar hirya-ki sa:tpuṛa ḍongor imne

(f) ḍongor-ki kho:b ja:nwar-ta imne
forest-in plenty animals
be
‘there are animals in the forest’
(85)(a) biḍi ra:ja ḍa:n

‘There was a king’
(b) maka eṭey-ki ayre-ka ḍa:n ḍo parda:n-ta kho:bo ḍa:n

‘so to him (one) mother was and ministers many were’.
(c) jab acca samay ḍa:n

‘then was good time’
(d) enge kita:b a:wa:r-minja:r-ki ḍa:n

‘my book was inside the house’.
In the following ḍa:n is used as an aspectual marker with imne :
(e) eṭla a:wa:rki imne-ḍa:n

‘they had been at home’
(f) a:wa:rminja:r-minja:r-ki biḍi kuyi imne-ḍa:n

‘in the middle of the house there used to be a well’.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"Chapterization of the work: Besides the introduction, this work
contains three more chapters in the first section. The second and
third sections contain Texts and Vocabulary respectively. This work
is based on structural model of modern linguistics. In the first
section, the second chapter, on Phonology, provides an analysis of
segmental sounds of the speech variety, discussing problems of
phonemicization of vowel length; retroflex sounds and aspiration;
and also discusses phonotactics and syllabic structures. The chapter
on Grammar, provides an analysis of both morphology and syntax
of the speech form. Morphology, which is primarily of simple
agglutinative type, does not show complex morphophonemic
changes. Whatever morphophonemic changes have been observed,
they have been discussed in respective sections. The model of ‘item
and arrangement’ has been employed for this analysis. As far as
possible all aspects of the language have been analysed. Still, being
based on ‘data’, and lack of full understanding of the texts, nativelike perception could not be obtained. So, the author is painfully
aware of the possibility of the analysis not being fully satisfactory. It
is hoped that future works will overcome these limitations. Syntax isChapter 1/ Introduction5less exhaustive than morphology; but hopefully gives a fair
understanding of major features of it.
The fourth chapter, with a question whether Nihali is an Isolate,
the answer being that it is an isolate. Here this speech form has been
compared with Korku, which being very close to it physically as
well as most of the speakers are bilingual in it. As no other language
has any chance of being comparable as they are very different from
it, and Korku’s influence on it is most significant; an attempt has
been made in this chapter to compare them taking various aspects
and prove that it is not in any way connected to Korku. Also a list of
so-called two hundred basic wordlist has been provided for both the
languages. In addition, comparable wordlist has been provided
from Mundari, a close relative of Korku, which will serve the
purpose of indicating the relationship with Korku. This hopefully
supports the claim that Nihali is not related to Munda languages. No
attempt has been made to identify whether each comparable set is
native or borrowed. It has been left for the readers’ judgment to
decide on the closeness.
The second section provides 8 texts with grammatical
identifications, at times taking phrases into consideration, using subscripts to mark them for easy matching; followed by summary
meaning.
The third section provides listing of total vocabulary collected
with glosses in English and also with remarks wherever possible.
No serious attempt has been made to identify each and every
borrowed item.","[15, 16]"
"In the above complex sentence, three verb phrases are included.
The first one is a participial type (non-finite), obtained by adding –e
to the verb e:r ‘to go’; dukan-hinga e:r-e:r-e ‘(after) going towards

(vi) bammaka ‘otherwise/if not’:
This form is made up of the negative form beṭhe and maka ‘so’.
When they join, it becomes bam-maka. It is a possible construction,
though not very frequently used. It is used to connect two clauses.
With it the first clause becomes subordinate; while the following
one is the main clause.
(221) ne pya bammaka jo pa:ṭoken

iiiABOUT THE BOOK . . . .
India is the homeland of languages of five different families- Dravidian,
Austroasiatic, Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman and Andamanese. There are a few
languages which are not part of any of these genetic groups and Nihali
happens to be one of them. Nahals come under scheduled tribes and their
population is estimated to be around 4000. The Language Tables of Census of
India 2001 enumerate a total of 122 languages at the national level- 22
Scheduled and 100 Non-Scheduled. This is an outright understatement of the
existing reality. There are around 200 languages in the country out of which
75% to 80% are spoken by the tribal communities, which are ignored by the
criterion of having less than 10,000 speakers. To remedy the situation the
Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore has undertaken a massive
national project to protect and preserve these endangered languages.
Globalization and overwhelming importance of English are commonly cited as
causes of language endangerment in India. But even the major regional
languages like Telugu, Marathi, Hindi or Odiya also act as killers of minor
tribal speeches. Over the past millions of years, the Indian experience had
been one of retention of minor tongues, but with the intrusion of electronic
media of regional languages, the younger generation is shifting its loyalty
towards them at the cost of its mother tongue. Under such circumstances the
study of Nihali by Prof. Nagaraja is a vital addition to our understanding of
the current phenomenon of language endangerment.
As the title suggests the present volume consists of grammar, texts and
vocabulary besides a brief introduction. Dr.Nagaraja has commenced his
fieldwork on Nihali in the late 1990s and since then he has been eliciting and
analyzing the data, intermittently for the last one and half a decade. The Nihali
speakers of Buldana district of Maharashtra, spread over 5-6 villages, have
been his main informants. The speakers are bilinguals speaking Nihali and
Korku (some of them know Marathi or Hindi). The impact of Korku on Nihali
is noticed at all levels and the scholar’s intensive work on the former
unearthed the different areas of convergence.
The grammatical analysis and description are carried out within the model
of modern American Structural linguistics. Establishment of functional
sounds, their contrasts, distribution and allophones together with syllable
structure form the description of phonology. The term grammar comprises theivtraditional morphology as well as syntax with convincing examples drawn
from elicited data and texts. Under noun morphology person, number, gender
and case are detailed together with pronouns and numerals. The morphosyntax
of verb-structure reveals the unique structural patterns of Nihali. The original
analysis is supported by nearly 250 phrases, clauses and sentences, each point
dwelling and dealing with structural nuances. Dr.Nagaraja’s Nihali Language:
Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary is a landmark of his years of linguistic
fieldwork on different minor, neglected and tribal languages. He has firsthand
experience of working on Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian group
of languages. One may recall his earlier grammatical treatises on Khasi, Korku
and Konyak together with texts and multilingual dictionaries.
One of the seminal issues regarding Nihali is about its genetic affiliation. It
is shown that Nihali shares certain phonological and grammatical features
with Korku (of Austroasiatic group) and more lexical items, which may be due
to contact in a bilingual situation. Nihali still remains as an isolate of the
Central Indian linguistic area.
Nihali texts represent the narratives dealing with several aspects of tribal
life including the traditional knowledge, life style, equality of persons, joy and
sorrow of the people and their philosophy of life. The texts are represented in
phonetic transcription, rather than transliteration, to preserve the spoken style
of the narratives. Each sentence is numbered, with word-to-word meaning and
free translation into English. Nihali lexical items are given in the English
alphabetical order with their meanings on the left side and the source of
borrowing, if any, on the right (in a three-column arrangement).
Nihali was identified as a separate speech in the mid 1950s by the late
Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya and after a lapse of nearly six decades, the present
volume is the first original detailed study of this endangered language isolate.
It will be of great interest to the students and scholars of Linguistics,
Anthropology, Folklore, Lexicography, Education and Language Planning.
Dr.Nagaraja deserves the appreciation of academic community for his
unceasing seminal linguistic fieldwork and language analysis, with untiring
commitment.

This work, as my other works, has taken almost a decade to complete, or
to get to this shape. It is difficult to say whether it is really complete. An
effort has been made to make it as exhaustive as possible.
I started taking interest on this language way back in 80s and 90s of
last century when I used to teach a course in Languages of South Asia in
which Nihali was also included. But at that time very little information on
the language was available except for Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya’s paper
based on a field trip in fifties of the same century. All other works
belonged to much earlier periods. Naturally I wanted to work on this
language. After completing work on Korku, I decided to work on Nihali.
The first fieldtrip was conducted in 1996 to locate the speakers of this
language. After locating the speakers every year I used to make short
visits to the areas and collect some data and compare the same with the
previous data to ascertain whether it is really same or different from them.
In this, knowledge of Korku assisted me to a great extent as I could
easily identify what is Korku and what is not Korku. Data collection was
in bits and pieces for many years. Even that I could not do during the last
three years of my service, as I was heavily burdened with administrative
and other responsibilities. During that time, Professor Rajesh Sachdeva of
Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, wanted me to work on
Nihali much more seriously and for that he generously offered me a
fellowship in his Institute. I readily accepted the offer as it gave me
adequate time to work on the language in detail. The present work is the
result of that endevour.
I thank first of all Deccan College Post-graduate & Research Institute,
Pune where I served till end of October 2009, and was encouraged to work
on this language and also I was allowed to work on the same language for
the Fellowship as well. I am highly grateful to the Institute for all the
support.viDuring the fellowship, I again visited the field a couple of times to
collect more data and also to verify the data collected before. This has
helped me to expand the work and also to improve the work. I thank my
informants for their patient support; particularly the following: Babulal
Kisan, and Babulal Motiram, both from Kuverdeo; Dongorvesh Nihal
Vadi, Mohan Jumaklal Nihal, Kailash Ganesh and Kashiram Shanu from
Jamod; Korda Vilas from Wasali.
I thank Prof. Rajesh Sachdeva, Director I/c, for the fellowship and all
the assistance he extended me during this work which has enabled me to
complete the work. I also thank the Director I/c, Prof. S.N.Barman, who
was incharge when my fellowship came to an end; and Prof. Awadesh K.
Mishra, the present Director, who not only gladly agreed to get this
volume printed in the Institute itself, but also gave valuable suggestions
for the improvement of the work; and the staff, the Library for their
assistance to make my work environment conducive. My sincere thanks
are due to Shri Venugopal, in-charge of Fellowship section for all the
support in making my stay more comfortable. I thank Professor
B.Ramakrishna Reddy of Hyderabad for reading the previous versions of
the manuscript and suggesting many corrections and also for writing a
meaningful introductory note for this volume. I am grateful to Professor
Panchanan Mohanty for valuable comments on the previous version of
this work.
I thank also Dr. Kedusto Kapfo, the Deputy Director and in-charge of
Press, Dr. Srinivasacharya, looking after the publications, and the Press
personnel, particularly Sri Subrata Chowdhury, Press Manager i/c for
printing of the book and Sri M.N. Chandrashekar of Publication Unit for
pagination of the entire book, Sri H. Manohar for making the book cover
designing and the staff of the Press for seeing through this volume
meticulously and efficiently. I am grateful to them for their sincerity and
dedication to their work.

3.4.3. Interrogative forms*: The interrogative forms in this speech
form are the following- na:n 'what', nani 'who', naway 'why',
nawa:san 'how, why'; mi- ‘which’, meran 'when', minga:y 'where',Chapter 3 / Grammar39m(i)yan 'how much'. From this list it appears that basically there are
two interrogative bases, made of na- and mV-. By suffixing -n to the
first base, a form 'questioning inanimate object' is obtained; by
suffixing -i to the base of nan-, a form 'questioning an animate
object' is obtained; by suffixing -ay to the base of na-, a form
* In this and the following section no distinction is made between
‘pronouns’ and ‘others’.
‘questioning reason' is obtained. By suffixing -san to the
interrogative form ‘questioning reason’, a form 'questioning why' is
obtained. (Alternatively, the base may be considered to be nan
instead of na-; then it itself 'questions inanimate object', etc.). By
suffixing -ga:y to the base (mV-), a form 'questioning location' is
obtained, and by suffixing -(y)an to the same base a form
'questioning quantity' is obtained. Interrogative forms can either
occur at the beginning of the sentence or immediately after the
subject or at the end of a sentence depending upon the nature of the
question, as will be clear from below. So, they can take some case
markers, like nominative (zero), objective, dative, etc. A few
illustrations are provided below.:

sentence or at the end, depending upon the nature of the question.

3.7. VERBS
3.7.0. General remarks: In this language verbal structure is very
simple. Normally verbs occur after the noun phrase(s) in a sentence.
In other words, verbal structure ends a sentence. The verbal
structure normally consists of the verb root+tense +/ aspect marker
only. So, the verbal morphology though agglutinative in nature, is
quite simple. While three-way tense distinction is available, only
two aspectual distinctions are noted; and moods are not very
complex. There are only indicative mood, which is unmarked,
imperative mood and interrogative mood. So, except for these three
moods, no finer distinctions seem to be available.
On the whole a verb is capable of taking verbalizer/infinitve
marker –be. However all verbs do not take it. Particulalry
intransitive verbs like imni ‘be’, ulta:y ‘fall’, harp- ‘lose’, ola(y)‘be wet’, pya-/pak- ‘come’, cark- ‘fall’, doksa- ‘flow’, etc. Most of
the transitive verbs are capable of taking infinitive marker.
Though this language agrees with all other languages of the area
in word order (like Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda), verbs do not
take any agreement markers. From that point of view it is very
different from them.","[69, 70]"

both the languages by suffixing -ka to the interrogative forms. In
this aspect similarity is found in these two languages. For instance:
nan 'who': nani-ka 'someone'; nani-ka-bi 'anyone', In Korku: je-ka
'someone', je-ka-bi 'anyone', etc.
4.2.6. Case: Case is marked by suffixes and/or postpositions. But
'case' is not highly distinctive. Many cases have undergone
syncretization. So, it is in a state of simplification. Nominative case
is unmarked. The first noun phrase in a sentence usually will be in
this case. If it is followed by another NP, it will be in accusative
case. Here, if the object is animate, then it is marked by the case
suffix. If the NP is inanimate, no case marker is used with it. In case
of animate NPs, human nouns take -n as the suffix, while nonhuman nouns take -na as the suffix. For examples, see below.
Instrumental, dative and locative cases are marked by using the
same overt case suffix, -ki. Ablative and sociative cases are marked
by the use of the suffix (or postposition) -gon. (eṭey-gon 'from/with
him').",[150]
"CHAPTER 4
IS NIHALI, an Isolate ?
4.0. General remarks: The above brief description of Nihali
structure hopefully unravels the intrinsic nature of the language. But
as it is today, is probably less distinctive than what it might have
been a couple of centuries before. Though this structure can be
compared with any language structure typologically; it would be
more fruitful to compare it with the language which is physically
very close to it than others. Among the potential languages of the
area, Korku, Hindi, Marathi; Korku seems to have more influence
on Nihali than others, as most of the Nihals know Korku. Therefore
here an attempt is made to compare these two languages. Wherever
it is appropriate other languages will be brought into the picture. For
instance in case of numerals, Hindi numbers have taken over
beyond 4 (as mentioned above), and various lexical items also seem
to have similar source.
The vocabulary, which is most affected of all; shows signs not
only of borrowing from Korku, but also from other sources like Dr.
and IA. As it is natural many of the borrowings have become
nativized in their system. Once a noun is taken into the language, it
behaves like a native form by taking regular number marker or hela.
Similarly a noun can function like a verb, by taking verbal markers,
such as kamay or jerey or caka-; or use of suffixes like –ka or –ki
readily converts a foreign word into a native one.
The most affected area is the Nihali phonology. The present
structure is such that it almost has become bland, and so similar to
other families of the area in many structural aspects. It was
indicated in the previous sections that vowel length and aspiration
are secondary; so their presence can be directly attributable to IA
languages. Similarly the retroflex series is very unstable, indicating
the possibility of it being non-native. Though at present these
speakers live away from the Dravidian communities like Gondi or
Kolami; probably they must have had some contact with them for
some considerable time before. Of course it is also possible that130The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysome of these features might have entered through the neighbouring
and alternate (Munda) language, particularly Korku. As most Nihals
live in close proximity to Korkus, and most of them are bilinguals in
Korku this is very likely.
4.1. The vowel system is simple, almost in line with Munda
languages like Korku. The morphemes are predominantly open
(vowel ending); seldom have initial or final consonant clusters. The
syllabic structure is mainly of CVCV type.
There are no unusual features which can be considered to be
peculiar to this language. So, no checked sounds which are found in
Munda languages (even though Korku has lost this feature). Lexical
items are quite different from Korku or any other language; even
though some losses can be observed. Pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogatives, negatives, tense, aspect markers are all different as
compared to other languages. A list of two-hundred common words
has been given at the end of this section comparing Korku forms.
This will provide important lexical differences.
Typologically Nihali is remarkable for its simplicity; while
Korku is quite complex and distinctive, having most of the so-called
Munda features intact.
Phonemic Inventory:
The phonemic inventory of Nihali is as follows:
Vowels: i, e, a, o, u; and / : /. Length has been given phonemic
status. Nasalization is not phonemic in this speech form.
Consonants: Based on the availability of minimal and sub-minimal
pairs, the consonantal inventory has been provided.
BilabialAlveolarRetroflexPalatalVelarptṭck131Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?phthṭhchkhbdḍjgbhdhḍhjhghmnñs
r
wlh
ṛ
yAs far as the distribution of phonemes is concerned, all the
vowels can occur in all the three positions. The consonants except
the retroflex ones can occur in the initial position. In the medial
position all the consonants can occur. In final position only the
following consonants can occur- -p, -t, -j, -ñ, -m, -n, -l, -r, -w, and y.
When Korku phonemic structure is compared with the Nihali
structure, they appear very similar. Korku phonemic inventory
contains the following phonemes:
i, e, a, o, u and / : /. Also it has a nasalized /ã/ as phoneme.
In the consonant series Korku has all the consonants which are
found in Nihali, and also has /ḍh/. It may be noted that the
limitations observed in case of Nihali are also applicable for Korku
as well. The only difference is that Nihali does not seem to have
nasalized phonemes; though nasalized vowels are noted. The
lexicon includes nasalization wherever such words are available and
have been marked so for accurate pronunciation.
As far as distribution and concatenation of consonants are
concerned, both languages have similar tendencies. That is, no
consonant clusters are found in the initial position, and only a few
combinations are allowed in final position. The consonant132The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysequences are available mainly in the medial position. The syllabic
structure is fairly same: CVC(C).
4.2. Morphology in both the languages is agglutinative in character
and simple. In Nihali it is simpler than in Korku. The roots of the
language are primarily disyllabic with vowel ending. The common
canonical structure of the roots is- CVC(C)V(C). Morphological
processes employed are - affixation (generally suffixation),
compounding and reduplication. However, in Korku, infixation is a
dominant and regular process, besides prefixation and suffixation;
while Nihali does not have infixation, though in the area of
demonstratives it is possible to posit infixes. As it is not available
elsewhere, this feature may not be a native feature of the language
concerned.
4.2.1. Number: Three-level distinction between singular vs. dual vs.
plural is available in Nihali and similarly Korku also shows such a
three-level distinction.

(b) maka:n bokki-ghelya kawlu hona

‘I came by walking’Chapter 3 / Grammar91(b) eṭey a:wa:rkon a:pa-ḍone e:ri

‘he went home weeping’
(v) Temporal clauses indicate the time of action. In this speech
form the verb is reduplicated to express this aspect. For instance, the
verb e:r ‘to go’, by reduplicating it, e:r-e:r ‘go-go’ > ‘while going’,
conveys a sense of duration of action.

(c) mer-mer-ka engki agin bi
play-play me-to sweat came-pt
‘Playing –playing (playing for long time) I sweated’
(sweat came to me).
Reduplication of verbs in the above way is a common method of
obtaining temporal clauses. (More on reduplication will be
discussed in the section on Reduplication, 3.11.).
3.8. Adjectives: Basically adjectives are those which modify a noun.
Adjectives precede the noun head in a nominal construction. When
an adjective precedes a head noun, it functions purely as a noun
modifier; while if the order is reversed, that is, when an adjective
occurs after the head noun, it becomes an adjectival predicate, as (a)
and (b) illustrate this point clearly. In such cases no other verb is
required, as in (b). Illustrations:92The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary(147)(a) hi masto pirjo pa:ṭokini
this beautiful girl come-ing
‘this beautiful girl is coming’.
(b) hi pirjo masto
this-girl beautiful
‘this girl (is) beautiful’.
A noun also can function as an adjective, as below.:
(148)(a) guru:ji ko:l ‘teacher-woman/female’= female teacher
vs. hi ko:l iskulki guru:ji
‘this lady (is) teacher in/of a school’
(b) a:khiri nana-pa:lso

The term nahal in the Nihali/Nahali language means ‘tiger’ or
‘lion’. Russel and Hiralal (1916) describe the Nahal or Nihal as a
hybrid of the Bhil and Korku. They were also identified with an
ancient community, called Nahalka, mentioned in Padma Purana as
an offshoot of the Nishada. The Nahals are subdivided into
Raghuvanshi and Tavadia sections. The Korku, who first migrated
to the Berar region of Madhya Pradesh, found the Nahal in
possession of the hills. Gradually, the Nahals lost their land. They
are notified under the nomenclature Nihal/Nahul as a scheduled
tribe, and are grouped along with the Korku, Bopchi, Mouasai,
Bondhi and Bondeya. At present, the Nahals of this area speak
Nimari, an Indo-Aryan language. However, in some places like
Buldhana district of Maharashtra, Nahals speak their own language,
which is highly influenced by Korku and other languages. The
Nahals are further divided into a number of totemic clans (nata).
Monogamy is the norm. They mainly subsist on agriculture labour.
They are mostly employed as labourers in agricultural fields by
other communities. (From K.S.Singh’s People of India book)
Nihali, also Nahali, had 3600 speakers according to 1961 census
of India reports. The speakers are found in an area of about fifty
square miles in the northern extremes of Buldhana district of
Maharashtra. Though Nihals are found in Amravati district of
Maharashtra and East Nimar district of Madhya Pradesh, in the
foothills of the western-most range of the Satpuda mountains they
no longer speak their own speech form. According to the available
information there are no monolingual adult Nihals. Only two brief
descriptive articles have appeared on this language so far.
However, comparative studies have been somewhat richer, since the
genetic relation of Nihali is a matter of dispute. Konow believed
the language to be Munda, with heavy Dravidian and Indo-Aryan2The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyaccretion. But even the Munda element consists largely of Korku
loans, and in 1941 R.Shafer proposed that Nahali represents an
altogether separate stock. F.B.J. Kuiper has shown that over 20
percent of the available vocabulary of Nahali is unrelated to that of
any Indian linguistic family. The present study corroborates with
this view.
The Nihali language has great significance, due to its uniqueness,
in not having any known relationship with any known language. In
this regard Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya had conducted a fieldtrip in
1954-55. After that, though some data was collected from the
Nahals of Buldhana district of Maharashtra, in the sixties of
previous century under the Munda project, it came to light only in
1996, in the form of Nihali lexicon published in a Journal called
Mother Tongue in the USA. Other than that, no scholar had shown
any interest in this language. In order to fill this vacuum in 1996 a
pilot study was conducted by the present scholar to ascertain where
these speakers are living. That fieldtrip was successful in locating
these speakers, in a place called Jamud, and in the neighboring areas
in Buldhana district of Maharashtra. There are not many villages
where this language is spoken.
In around five-six villages in that district these speakers are
located, but in small numbers. There is no exclusive village where
these speakers live. Most of them are bilinguals or multi-linguals;
knowing at least Korku, a Munda language of higher social prestige
and having large number of speakers in the area; and/or local
varieties of Marathi/Hindi as well. Most Nihals are landless
labourers, so economically very poor. Because of it, they come in
contact with other language speakers for their own survival. As their
number is quite small, education, which is very recent, has to be
imparted to them through other languages. So, their language has
been influenced very much by Korku and to some extent by otherChapter 1/ Introduction3languages. Since 1998 yearly some data has been collected on the
language spoken in Buldhana district of north Maharashtra by the
present writer. So far all the villages where Nihals live and speak
the language have been covered. Based on the data, a preliminary
phonemic analysis and a tentative grammatical sketch have been
prepared.
Statistical and Geographical data
Nihali speaking people live in the following villages: Jamod,
Sonbardi, Kuvardev, Chalthana, Ambavara, Wasali and Cicari - all
in Buldhana district and also fairly close to each other. It has been
observed that a few dialectal differences, particularly in the lexicon
have been observed between Kuvardev-Chaltana varieties vs.
Jamod-Sonbardi varieties. Elsewhere not much of variation is found
between these speech forms. In the following description general
features of Nihali language will be discussed.
It may be noted that Nihals as a community are found more
widely scattered in southern Madhya Pradesh and Northern
Maharashtra. But except for the villages listed here, they have given
up their speech form in favour of either Korku, or Nimadi, Hindi,
etc.
The villages and the approximate number of Nihals given below :
1. Jamod : situated 12 kms north of Jalgaon (in Buldhana dt.),
around 360 houses = more than two thousand speakers
2. Sonbardi : situated three kms behind Jamod, has 40-50
houses = around 300 speakers
3. Kuvardev : situated a few kms right side of Jamod, has 12-15
houses = 50-60 speakers
4. Chalthana (Shantinagar) : situated around two kms before
Kuvardev, has 50-60 houses = 400-450 speakers4The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary5. Ambawara : situated 27 kms. from Jamod, has 20 houses =
100-150 speakers
6. Wasali : situated around 15 kms left side of Jamod, on the
main road; has 12-15 houses = around 50 speakers.
7. Cicari : situated beyond Wasali, has 30 houses = 250
speakers
So, the total Nihali-speaking population comes to around four
thousand only. The map on page 6 provides approximate locations
of these villages.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
"In the following set the first demonstrative adjective iṭi marks
remote visible while the second uṭi marks remote-non-visible.:
enge a:wa:r iṭi a:ḍḍo uṭi dha:rki
my house that tree’s that side-to137Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?‘my house (is) that tree’s that side’.
uṭi-dharna sama:n ko:be
that-side-from thing bring
‘bring thing(s) from that side’
A form herey is used as third person form, as well as proximate
demonstrative pronoun, similar to ha:n.:
(a) herey ‘this/he/she/they’ : as in:
herey engako:l
‘she/this (is) my wife’.
(b) hawṭ-in ‘there’, as in:
anga:rko hawṭ-in-ki a:kha:be
shirt
there-at
hang-to
‘hang the shirt there’
Proximate demonstrative adjective has a some-what contracted
form, han > hi-; while in the remote type hoṭan > ho- can be of this
type (see below).:
(a)hi- 'this':
hi-manso
(h)iṭi- 'that': iṭi -manso
ho-manso'this man',
'that man',
‘that man’In Korku, the situation is much more elaborate though simpler.
Here the basic distinction is between proximate vs. remote. Within
each type, sub-divisions can be made, as follows:

between [iC] vs. [ḍV] vs. [hV] 'near vs. far. vs. remote'. But the
third distinction is not available for all contrasts. In Nahali a partial
similarity is found, in that, [hV] is 'proximate', and [iC] is 'remote'.
A set of infix seems to be found, which is not found in Korku.
4.2.5. Interrogative forms: The interrogative forms in Nihali are
the following- nan 'what', nani 'who', naway 'why', nava:san 'why';
meran 'when', minga:y 'where', m(i)yan 'how much'. It appears that
basically there are two interrogative bases, made of na- and mV-. By
suffixing -n to the first base, a form 'questioning thing' is obtained;
by suffixing -i to the base of nan, a form 'questioning a person' is
obtained; by suffixing -ay to the base of na-, a form ‘questioning
reason' is obtained. By suffixing -san to the interrogative form
‘questioning reason’, a form 'questioning why' is obtained.
(Alternatively, na- base may be considered to be nan instead; then it
itself 'questions thing', etc.). By suffixing -ga:y to the base (mV-), a
form 'questioning location' is obtained, and by suffixing (y)an to the
same base a form 'questioning quantity' is obtained.
The indefinite forms are obtained by suffixing an element -ka(bi)
to the interrogative forms. : nani-ka 'whoever/ someone', nan-ka
'whatever/ something', me:-kabi 'whenever/ sometime', mi:n-kabi
'wherever/somewhere', nawa-kabi 'however/somehow', etc. This
pattern of obtaining indefinite forms from interrogative forms is
very similar to that found in Korku. Even the element is same.
However the interrogative forms as such are very different in both
these languages. There is no relative pronoun in this language.","[147, 148, 149]"
"153borrowing from Indo-Aryan languages of the area. Even without
going into the statistics, it becomes quite clear that Nihali is not
related to Korku from lexical point of view as well.
When similar comparison is carried out between Nihali and
Dravidian languages like Gondi, which was probably spoken in that
area some time back; we find many lexical items similar between
them. This aspect probably indicates to the fact that either Nihals
lived for some time with Gondi speaking people before reaching the
present settlements. For one thing unfortunately Nihals do not
remember from when they are living in the areas where they are
living now and from where they might have moved in. Their oral
literature does not reveal this aspect. Probably more intensive work
on their language and culture might reveal these aspects.
4.2.12. Conclusion: The above limited comparison clearly shows
that Nihali is not similar to Korku. Though from the point of
structural considerations, there is some similarity. But beyond that
no similarity can be found. This dissimilarity probably prompted
Bhattacharya in 1954 itself to consider it as a non-Munda language.
The present description clearly supports his contention. In this
language verbal structure is very simple. Normally verbs occur after
the noun phrase(s) in a sentence. In other words, verbal structure
ends a sentence. The verbal structure normally consists of the verb
root+tense +/ aspect marker only. So verbal morphology, though
agglutinative in nature, is quite simple. While a three-way tense
distinction is available, only two aspectual distinctions are noted;
and moods are not very complex. There are only three moods, viz.
indicative mood, which is unmarked, imperative mood and
interrogative mood. So, except for these three moods, no finer
distinctions seem to be available.
Though this language agrees with all other languages of the area
in word order like Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda), verbs do not154The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularytake any agreement elements. From that point of view, it is very
different from them.
The above comparative table provides some interesting facts
about the possible closeness between Nihali and Korku. Out of two
hundred word list above, more than half are different between them.
Even without going into the statistics, it becomes quite clear that
they are not related from lexical point of view as well. When similar
comparison is carried out between Nihali and Dravidian languages
like Gondi, which was probably spoken in that area some time back;
we find many lexical items similar between them. This aspect
probably indicates to the fact that either Nihals lived for some time
with Gondi speaking people before reaching the present settlements.
Their oral literature does not reveal this aspect. Probably more
intensive work on their language and culture might reveal these
aspects.","[164, 165]"
"248NIHALI VOCABULARY
Notes: This list is fairly an exhaustive one. It includes all the
vocabulary that could be collected so far, and it has also taken into
account the list provided by Aasha Mundalay. The transcription is
fairly phonemic. There is great fluctuation as for as vowel length is
considered as stated before. But, wherever possible, length has been
indicated, for accurate pronunciation. Similarly the retroflex series
is not very stable. Wherever fluctuations between the alveolar and
retroflex sounds have been encountered, they have been indicated.
There are a few problematic as well as doubtful cases, which
need to be clarified at a later date. Some of them have been
indicated by a question mark. The present data has been collected
from a few nearby villages. Various texts have been collected by
different speakers. A few dialectal features have been noted. Here
no attempt has been made to provide an exhaustive statement
regarding dialectal differences. That will be for the future work.
In the ‘remarks’ column an attempt has been made to identify
the borrowed words. For time-being it is highly tentative, subjective
and impressionalistic. Proper identification will need more work.
This vocabulary has been arranged on Roman order. Between
alveolar and retroflex sounds, first words with alveolar sound has
been listed followed by the words with retroflex variety. However,
internally no effort has been made to organize them strictly on that
basis. Secondly, words with long vowels are listed after words with
short vowels (in the first syllable).","[259, 260]"
"108The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary3.12. PHRASAL AND CLAUSAL CONSTRUCTIONS
3.12.1. Word Order
The word order in this speech form is SOV. It is quite simple and
analytic. An important aspect of Nihali verbal structure is that it
does not carry any person/number/gender markers unlike Korku or
Indo-Aryan. Though the normal word order is SOV, as can be seen
from most of the illustrations, it is possible to have OSV, as in
focusing, etc. :
(180)tembrya dho:r-na cekiya OR dho:r-na tembrya cekiya
tiger-sub cow-obj catch-pt
cow-obj tiger-sub catch-pt
S
O
V
O
S
V
Both the above constructions mean only ‘tiger caught the cow’,
as the nouns carry appropriate case markers.
First phrasal structure is discussed followed a discussion of clausal
structures.
3.12.2. Noun phrases
Normally noun phrases are made up of an adjective followed by a
head noun; so they have Adj.+N structure. In addition to an
adjective, a demonstrative and /or a numeral could occur as well.
They also have Dem + Adj.+N structure.
(a) Adjective + Noun construction: While listing adjectives good
number of them have been presented with nouns in their phrasal
construction. So, here only a few examples have been provided.
(181) gidar lakṛi-ṭa ‘lot of sticks’
mija:r akhanḍa ‘middle finger’
bakko mija:r
hand middle ‘palm’Chapter 3 / Grammar109arma:n piratta ‘many girls’
(b) N+N constructions, where the head will be the second member.:
(182) hori tiwa:r ‘holi festival’
baṭko a:ḍḍo ‘mango tree’
bakko phuli ‘wrist’ (hand-joint)
cigam pasla
ear
back ‘back of ear’
khuri mija:r
foot middle ‘soul of foot’
An adjective like bha:ga ‘big’ can function as an intensifier when it
occurs modifying another adjective, as below. It may be noted that
the head noun always occurs in the right-most part:
(183) bha:ga lamba a:ḍḍo ‘very long tree’
bha:ga ja:ṛa ma:nso ‘very heavy man’
bha:ga haram ko:l ‘big/eldest bad woman’
bha:ga cawṛa para:y ‘very broad river’
(c) Demonstrative + N:
(184) hin biya ‘this village’ vs.
hin ma:w-ṭa ‘these horses’
iṭi ma:nso ‘that man’ vs. iṭi man-ṭa ‘those people’
It may be noted from above, that the noun takes the plural
marker while the demonstrative form as such will not take it.
(d) Numeral/Dem+Adj.+N:
(185) biḍi bha:ga sa:na ‘one elderly person/man’
iṭi bha:ga sa:na ‘that elderly person/man’
iṭi-kuṭhi-kona jakkan
that-box –of lid
‘that box’s lid’ (= ‘lid of that box’)110The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyWhen a numeral which stands for ‘two’ is used, if it modifies an
animate noun, another form hiṭkel ‘both’ is used, more like a
classifier. If the noun is inanimate as in the last example below,
book, it is not used. Further, with an animate noun normally the
plural marker is added to the noun even when a quantifier is used as
can be seen below. But with an inanimate noun the plural marker is
not used. Then a quantifier alone conveys the sense of plurality.
NUM + N (animate)+ hiṭkel:
(186)(a) biḍi giṭa ‘one younger sister’:
i:r-giṭa-hiṭkel
two-young.sister-both ‘two sisters’
i:r-ḍa:y-hiṭkel‘two brothers-both’(b) ma:w ‘horse’: i:rma:w hiṭkel ‘two horses’
(c) na:y ‘dog’ : i:rna:y hiṭkel ‘two dogs’
NUM/QUANT+N (inanimate):
(187) i:r pustok ‘two books’: kho:bo pustok ‘plenty of books’
biḍi ca:go ‘one stone’ : i:r ca:go ‘two stones’
QUANT+N(animate):
(188)(a) kho:bo ma:w-ṭa
‘many/plenty horses’
kho:bo na:y-ṭa
‘many/plenty dogs’
QUANT+N (inanimate): Here the plural marker is not used.:
(b) kho:bo ca:go ‘plenty/many stone(s)’
In case of noun a:wa:r ‘house’ holds a special position. It can
also mean ‘home’/ ‘family’, so it can take hiṭkel, as in the following:
(189)i:r-a:wa:r hiṭkel ‘two houses’ (= members of two houses)
kho:bo a:wa:r ‘many houses’111Chapter 3 / Grammarkho:bo a:wa:r he:la ‘all of many houses’
he:la gives ‘inclusive sense of family’. So, it is used with
animate nouns. Similarly:
(190)bidi bakko ‘one hand’
i:r bakko hiṭkel ‘two hands-both’
kho:bo bakko ‘many hands’
kho:bo bakko he:la ‘many hands - people’Possessive constructions: Here also the structure is: Pos.+N:
(191) enge pa:lso
enge pirjo pa:lso
my female child‘my child’
‘my female child’The following NP consists of a possessive phrase at the
beginning followed by another NP containing demonstratives.:
(192) enge-a:wa:r iṭi-a:ḍḍo uṭi-dha:r-ki (iṭi-a:ḍḍo uṭi-dha:r ‘that
tree’s that side’)
my house that tree that side-of
‘my house (is) that tree’s that side’
Two Noun Phrases can occur in a sequence in coordinate
relation, connected by the connector ḍo ‘and’:
(193) biḍi-bakko-ki lakri ḍo biḍi-bakko-ki kanḍil…
one hand-in stick and one hand –in lantern…
‘a stick in one hand and a lantern in another hand…’
Oppositive NPs can contain two NPs in opposition. Here is an
instance of the same. In this phrase enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na and
another NP acca-acca pakwa:n are in opposition. The first NP is a
possessive construction, ‘my hand’s food (= eating-drinking)’. The112The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularysecond part qualifies the first part. It is in opposition to the second
NP acca-acca pakwa:n ‘good-good food’.
(194)enge bakkoka kha:na pi:na acca-acca pakwa:n…
my hand-s
food drink good-good eatables…
‘my hand’s food drink good-good delicious items…’3.12.3. Verb phrases: These are made up a main verb, being
obligatorily present and preceded by either an adverbial
construction and or an object. A few illustrations can be provided
here. The first is an imperative construction, where both the subject
and second person are absent, and supposed to be covertly present.
Interestingly it contains an adverbial element as first member, jaldi
‘quickly’, followed by an indirect object, basel he:la:ki ‘to the
children’, and an object, beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi ‘one-one sweet’, and
finally the verb, in imperative formation, be:-ki ‘give’.
(195)jaldi basel he:la-ki beḍe-beḍe mitha:yi be:ki
quickly child-all-to one-one sweet-obj give-imp.
'Give quickly one-one sweet to all the children'In the next two illustrations, the adverbial elements occur after
the subject NP, and followed by the main verb.
(196)(a) jo seko:n minḍi ḍecco celom-na kappi
I yesterday night 10 o’clock-at sleep-pt
'I slept at 10 P.M. yesterday night'
(b) jo ro:ju-ka kama:y
sene-ka
I daily
work –obj go-npt
'I go to work daily'
In the following construction, the subject (NP) is a personal
pronoun jo ‘I’, or ne ‘you’(sg.); followed by the verbal complexChapter 3 / Grammar113containing the object backaren ‘children’ in (a), and hi-ka:mo ‘this
work’ in (b), followed by the transitive verbs in past tense, in (a)
and non-past tense in (b).
(197)(a) jo backa-ren anglujkamay
I
baby-obj bathe-make
'I bathed the baby'.
(b) ne hi-ka:mo kama:ken
you this-work do-can
‘You can do this work’
In the following two instances, the NP is more fuller in structure. In
(a), it is made up of a possessive construction, dharamra:ja-na orari
‘dharamraja’s wedding’ followed by the verbal structure. Similarly,
in (b) the NP is made up of the plural demonstrative hiṭkel taking a
postposition minja:r ‘middle’, to obtain hiṭkella minja:r ‘between
them’; followed by the object, tago-jagṛa ‘quarrel/fight’, and the
verb of happening, jere- in past tense.
(198)(a) dharamra:ja-na orari
jerey-ḍa:n
dharmaraja-pos wedding happen-perf
'Dharamraja's marriage had taken place'
(b) hiṭkella minja:rki tago-jagṛa jerey
both between-to
fight happen-pt
‘they both fought with each other’
The above illustrations provide some insight into the internal
structures of sentences. They also reveal the place of adverbials
when they occur. In the following, various types of sentences both
from the nature of the verb, and from the complexity will be
discussed. In this process it is hoped that some more insights will be
available as far as the language structure is concerned.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124]"
"26Chapter 3GRAMMAR
3.0. General remarks: Nihali’s word structure shows agglutinative
character; but it is simple. Not too many affixes get joined to a base
form. The roots of the language are primarily disyllabic with vowel
ending, though some consonant ending roots are possible. The
common canonical structure of a root is- CVC(C)V(C).
Morphological processes employed in this language are: affixation
(generally suffixation only (but potentially also infixation among
demonstratives only), compounding and reduplication.
3.1. Morphological processes
3.1.1. Affixation: In affixation mainly suffixation is employed in this
speech form. Prefixation is used marginally in adjectives section.
Infixation is almost not used at all. Suffixation is used to derive
agentive and other types of nouns from verbs, etc. For instance the
suffix –re is used to obtain agentive nouns from verbs and nonagentive nouns. For instance:
(1)(a) saykal ‘cycle’ + -re >
saykal-re ‘cycle rider’
maw ‘horse’ + -re >
maw-re ‘horse rider’
cana ‘dance’ + -re >
cana-re ‘dancer’
pahun ‘guest’ + -re >
pahun-re ‘guest’ (one)
jam ‘to buy’ + -re
jam-re ‘buyer’
(1)(b) ḍhol-be ‘to beat drum’ + -re > ḍhol-be-re ‘drummer’
(ḍhol ‘drum’, be- ‘to beat’)
asuḍ-be ‘to swing’ + -re > asuḍre ‘swinger’
( = one who swings)
baro-be ‘to sing’+-re
baro-bi-ka-re ‘singer’
Another suffix –hela means ‘all’ can be added to nouns to obtain
agentive nouns in plural.:
(2)(a) biya ‘village’ + -hela >
basel ‘child’ + -hela >biyahela ‘villagers’
baselhela ‘children’28The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularypahun ‘guest’ +-hela >pahunhela ‘guests’There is another suffix, –ji used to derive nouns from verbs,
adjective, etc. It provides a sense of thing/object used for a purpose.
For instance, a verb like ceki- ‘to hold’ + ji > cekiji ‘tongs’ (= that
which is used to hold something). But this method is not very
productive, as only a few instances of this type are available. They
are listed below:
(b) ceki ‘to hold’ + -ji > cekiji ‘tongs’
cacom ‘to taste sweet’ + -ji > cacomji ‘sweet things’
aranga ‘to become stale (food)’ + -ji > aranga:ji ‘stale
food’(left over)
Obviously this method needs to be explored further.
Verbal nouns are obtained by suffixing –kini to verb roots. For
instance:
(3) cakha:w ‘to sweep’ + -kini > cakha:wkini ‘sweeping’
a:rko- ‘to clean’ + -kini >
a:rkokini ‘cleaning’
(something)
romki- ‘to cook’ +-kini >
romkikini ‘cooking’
me:r- ‘to play’ + -kini >
me:rkini ‘playing’,
ca:na ‘to dance’ +-kini >
ca:nakini ‘dancing’, etc.
3.1.2. Compounding: Compounding is neither productive nor
specific. Often no distinction is made between a compound and its
corresponding phrase. Even then some compounds can be
observed.:
Noun compounds:
N+N constituents:
(4) ba:batandur ‘rice’ (ba:ba ‘paddy’, tandur ‘rice/paddy’)
thomraba:ba ‘sticky rice’
mongraba:ba ‘flowery rice’
piphri-a:ḍḍo ‘peeple tree’ (a:ḍḍo ‘tree’)Chapter 3 / Grammar29ora:ḍḍo ‘banian tree’ (ora + a:ḍḍo ‘tree’)
Nominal compounds made up of N+N constituents.:
(5) a:ṭho-ko:l ‘man-woman’ (a:ṭ(h)o ‘man, male’, ko:l ‘woman’)
ko:l-a:ṭho ‘woman-man’
mo:ḍḍha:ri ‘triangle’ (mo:ṭho ‘three’ + ḍha:ri ‘path’)
garaḍã:y ‘cart road’ (gara ‘cart’, ḍã:y ‘path/road’)
biyako:l ‘village woman’ (biya ‘village’, ko:l ‘woman’)
guṛpan ‘engagement’ (guṛ ‘gaggary’, pan ‘betel leaf’)
Adj.+N constituents:
(6) jagtobolgo ‘male bear’ (jagto ‘male’, bolgo ‘bear’)
ko:lbotor ‘female hare’ (ko:l ‘female’, botor ‘hare’)
olaḍã:y ‘wet path’ (ola ‘wet’, ḍã:y ‘path’)
pa:ta:rbo:y ‘dry grass’ (hay) (pa:ta:r ‘dry’, bo:y ‘grass’)
ghanikokañ ‘small ant’ (a variety) (ghani ‘small’, kokañ ‘ant’)
ḍongakokañ ‘black ant’ (ḍonga ‘red ant’)
V+N constituents:
(7) beṭṭoko:go ‘dead snake’ (beṭṭo ‘dead’, ko:go ‘snake’)
e:risa:l ‘last year’ (e:ri ‘went’, sa:l ‘year’)
pa:ṭosa:l ‘next year’ (pa:ṭ- ‘to come’)
Verbal compounds normally will have an object.
N+V verbal compounds:
(8)hombo jere-be ‘to bend’ (hombo ‘body’)
siḍu jalu-ki
‘to brew liquor’ (siḍu ‘liquor’)
citra arku-be ‘to draw/carve a picture’ (citra ‘picture’)
ja:li kama:-be ‘to enclose’ (with a net)Reduplication: This aspect will be discussed separately at the end of
this chapter (sec. 3.11.).","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"Similarly, locative demonstrative can be used. :
(56) hin-ki pa:ṭo engki masto-ḍa:n
here-to come me-to good-be-pt
‘coming here was good to me’.
3.5. Case: Case is marked by suffixes and/or postpositions. But 'case'
is not highly distinctive. Many cases have undergone syncretization.
Accusative and possessive have merged into one; instrumental,
dative and locative cases have merged into one; ablative and
sociative have merged into one. So, effectively, only three49Chapter 3 / Grammardistinctions of case can be observed. This language uses
postpositions to some extent.

Ablative
Sociativeø
ø (inanimate),
-n (animate: human)
-na (animate: nonhuman)
ki, ka
kon/gon
kon/gon, hun3.5.1. Nominative case is unmarked. The first noun phrase in a
sentence usually will be in this case. If it is followed by another NP,
it will be in accusative case. Here, if the object is animate, then it is
marked by a case suffix. If the NP is inanimate, no case marker is
used to mark it. In case of animate NPs, human nouns take –n;
while non-human nouns take -na as the suffix. For examples, see
below.
3.5.2.(i) Accusative case: This case is marked by two overt
allomorphs, when the object stands for an animate noun; and when
the noun is inanimate no marker (i.e. ø) is used. If the animate noun
refers to human beings, then the allomorph -n is used; while with
nonhuman nouns –na is used.

The possessive marker is identical with accusative marker. But
possessive pronouns are used which are different from personal
pronouns for first person only. But, elsewhere same personal
pronouns are used for marking possession. In 1st person: enge 'my',
and ingin 'our' are used. Here also the marker can be zero,
particularly when the first member is a pronoun, as in the following.
The possession is marked partially by -n, -na, or ø (zero). But their
allomorphemic distribution is not neat. While -n is used with 3p.
plural form (a); -na is used with nouns ending in –i, -a (b); and the
zero occurs elsewhere (c).

"It is unusual to see the presence of a separate form for only first
person singular, while all other forms behave differently. Probably
is indicates the presence of a total set of possessive pronouns at an
earlier stage: which has been reduced to a single form now.
In Korku the possessive marker is -a; dissimilar to that of Nihali.
However, a structural similarity is found between them in that, in
both, when a pronoun is used in possessive construction, the marker
as such is not used. So, Korku: ale-kon 'our child', ḍiku-ura 'their
village', etc.
4.2.4. Demonstrative pronouns: In this speech form the
demonstrative pronouns are quite marked and complex. Basically a
two-way distinction is made, between ‘proximate’ vs. ‘remote’.
However within remote, further distinction is shown between
‘remote visible’ vs. ‘remote non-visible’. However this distinction is
not always maintained. The singular forms are the following:
Observe the basic set of pairs which distinguish between proximate
vs. remote distinctions using infixes.:
Proximate(D1)
ha:n 'this'

hiyan ‘this much’Remote-visible(D2)

that an infix –Vṭ- is used to derive the ‘remote’ forms from the
proximate forms. The ‘V-’ portion of the infix mostly will be a back
or a low vowel. It is unusual that this type of formation is not found
elsewhere in the language.
Besides the above, there are other forms also which are used in
this function.

converted into a transitive verb by adding a verb kama(y) to the
intransitive verb.
A verb like eger- ‘to remove/shave’ behaves like an intransitive, and
so takes kamay to become transitive, even when used for self. But as
they are made up of two-place predicates, the verbs are transitive.;
as in the following:
(132) (a) jo ba:y da:ṛi egerkamay
I today beard removed
‘today I removed beard’ (= I shaved (myself))
(b) eṭey enga-da:ṛi egerkamay
he my-beard removed
‘he shaved my beard’
(c) backaren a:pa-hora-kama:-biji

‘don’t make children weep’ (the agent is understood; so the
verb is transitive).
(d) jo eṭeyna a:pakamay (*a:pahorakamay)
I him-obj weep-make
‘I caused him to weep’
3.7.8. Causative formation: There are some lexical causatives in
this speech form, as can be seen from the following sets.:
(133)beṭṭ- ‘to die’
ṭye:-be ‘to eat’paḍay- ‘to kill’
ceṭṭhoki ‘cause to eat’/‘to feed’Causative is a three-place predicate with controlling agent Ag1,
performing agent Ag2 and the undergoer Obj3 of the action denoted86The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyby the verb. Causative verb is obtained morphologically when the
above condition is met.:
(1) First type, where the verb is inherently of bi-transitive type,
which does not require any other support to obtain a causative
construction:(133) jo eṭeyna a:pho berika
Ag1 Ag2 Obj3
V
I him-to firewood cut
‘I get wood cut by him/ I make him to cut wood’
(2) Second type, where the verb is transitive type, but requires
another verb of ‘make/cause’ to obtain causative construction, as the
following:
(134) jo nana:ṭaki joppo ḍelen-kamay
Ag1 Ag2 Obj3
V-V
I child-pl-to water drink-make
‘I made the children drink water’.
(3) In the above situation sometimes a form expessing duress hora
(Korku) is added to the main verb, then the verb kama(y)- is added
to it, as will be illustrated below.:
Intransitive:
(135)
ḍã:yki biḍiko:go beṭṭiḍa:n
road-on one-snake die-pt-pp
‘on the road one snake was dead’
Causative:
(136)(a) jo eṭlana ko:gona pa:ḍa-hora-kamay

Obj3
V
I children-obj weep cause
‘I caused the child to weep’
3.7.9. Non-finite verbal constructions: Among the different types
of non-finite verbal contructions, participial construction, marked
by –kini; waja-ki ‘due to/because of’, infinitival construction,
marked by –ka, and ghelya; gerundial construction, marked by ḍone; and temporal clauses marked by reduplicating the verb, etc.
Non-finite clauses are embedded within the main clause.
(i) Participial construction, marked by –kini, khenṭo:
(137)(a) jo / kama:ykini / enge bakko kha:nḍojere

‘I [while working] my hand cut-happened’
(While working I cut my hand- happened)

"Usually inanimate nouns do not take number markers as in Nihali.
Though structurally there is clear similarity of pattern, the markers
as such seem to be unrelated.
4.2.2. Gender: The gender distinction is between masculine and
feminine in animate nouns. While masculine forms are usually
unmarked, feminine forms are obtained by adding (suffixing) a form
marking femininity, like ko:l 'female/woman': guru:ji '(he) teacher':
guru:ji-ko:l 'female teacher'. With animals also gender distinction is
possible. Then to mark masculinity a separate form is used, ja:gto
'male'.: ja:gto tembrya 'male tiger' : ko:l tembrya 'female tiger'.
In Korku, gender is not marked. However kinship terms take a
few elements restrictively. Outside that domain no marker is used.
4.2.3. Personal pronouns: In personal pronouns Nihali has only
single set of forms as contrasted to Korku system which has two
sets, full and contracted. In both the languages personal pronouns
show a three-way number distinctions. The Nihali forms are:

"156The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyNIHALI TEXTS
The texts are presented in fairly phonetic transcription, though some
extent of phonemicization has taken place. For instance, length is
indicated wherever observed; but keeping narrator’s pronunciation
into account, an attempt has been made to keep editing to a
minimum; so that the text is as far as possible as it is narrated. So,
length and nasalization are marked even though they are not
phonemic in the language, to facilitate accurate pronunciation. Also,
a given word may have length in one place, but may not show it in
another place. Sentences are given numbers. Sentences and their
glosses have been given subscripts for easy reference; however, it
may be noted that they themselves do not have any significance.

kiminThe above table gives an interesting view of the differences
between Korku and Nihali languages. In Nihali all are single
morphemes except for manta ‘people’ where –ta is a plural marker.
Also, the form caca:w, having initial CV repeated seems to be144The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyproblematic. It could be a borrowing from Dravidian source. From
the above, it becomes clear that the basic forms are different in
these languages, though the method of obtaining compound kinship
terms is similar.
4.2.10. Word Order: The word order is SOV, similar to Korku, IA
and Dravidian. However Nihali order is quite simple and analytic as
compared to that of Korku or other language structures. The
important aspect of Nihali verbal structure is that it does not carry
any person/number/gender markers unlike Korku system which is
highly complex in this aspect. This feature can be considered as an
additional testimony to treat Nihali as unrelated to Munda
languages. Also verb stems are unchanging in Nihali irrespective of
the tense marker; while Korku has changing type.","[154, 155]"
"1Person:jotye:koingi2Person:nena:kola3Person:eṭeyhiṭkel*eṭey+la >
eṭlaAs can be observed from above, in the 1st person, the singular,
the dual and the plural forms are different from each other. Though
-ko might be interpreted as the dual marker, the dual base form does
not show any formal relationship with the singular form. The plural
form does not show the presence of any marker as such. So the
whole form has to be taken as a single morpheme standing for 1p
plural. In 2nd person, dual form can be obtained from suffixing -ko
to the singular form ne-. But the plural form is lexically entirely
different from either singular or dual form. The 3rd p. forms also
pose problems. Interestingly there is no distinction made in third
person singular between different genders. If needed, separate
gender markers are used. The dual form is quite different. It does
not take the dual suffix –ko, which is used in both 1st and 2nd
persons. Further the plural form is complex as it appears to take the
2p plural pronoun.
(22) Also, there are two more forms used in plural, hela ‘theyproximate’, and eṭla (< eṭey-la) ‘they-remote’.
3.4.2. Demonstrative pronouns: In this speech form the
demonstrative pronouns are quite marked and complex. Basically a
two-way distinction is made, between ‘proximate’ vs. ‘remote’.
However within remote, further distinction is shown between
‘remote visible’ vs. ‘remote non-visible’. However this distinction is

"66The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyVerbless constructions, where adjectives like masto ‘good’, backa
‘small’, kemti ‘less’, etc. function as predicate adjectives.:

eṭey ma:nso u:nca-(ka) ‘that person (is) tall’
(e) hipirjo kho:bo dima:g ‘this girl (is) very intelligent’
Even a noun can function as a predicate, in a possessive
construction, as in the following:

ram-to one-only hand
‘ram (has) one-only hand’
(b) hi-pustak-kon da:m kemti

Similarly, locational adverbials, which behave more like nouns, can
occur without a verb.:
(c) eṭlan a:wa:r mera:ki ‘their house (is) near’.
However the adjective kemti ‘less’ can be used more like a verb,
when it takes a suffix -ki, as in the following:Chapter 3 / Grammar(91)67hi-pustak-kon da:m kemti-ki

‘so thid female deer said “he goes I also will go’.
Relative clauses: In this language there is no specific relative marker
as such. As can be seen even by arranging two clauses sequentially
relative clause is conveyed. :
(229)(a) himanso uṭin cip-cippoka / eṭey enge ḍa:y hay

Summary: The preceding statements on the language structure
reveal, hopefully fairly clearly its structural simplicity and
complexities as well. It becomes quite clear that there are many
features which could be from neighbouring languages due to contact
and other forces. However, no attempt has been made to identify
them. Only a small effort has been made in the lexicon in this
direction; that too it is only a beginning and not an end in itself.
Much more needs to be done in unraveling its features for a better
understanding of the language.","[138, 139]"

3.6. Numerals: No native numeral system has been observed in this
language. The only important feature of the language is that except
for the first few numbers, all other numbers used in business
transactions are from Indo-Aryan. Only first number seems to be a
native word; without any comparable forms in any language of the
area. - biḍi/baḍa '1'. Bhattacharya (1957) had given two forms for
'one', one for masculine and another feminine. But the present
speakers know only one form, which is used without gender
distinction. Next three numbers are interesting and intriguing. They
seem to be borrowed from Dravidian source. They are: ‘2’ is:
ira:r/i:r (But Kannada (Dravidian) eraḍu; Khasi, a Mon-Khmer
language spoken in Meghalaya has a:r 'two'!); 3: mo:ṭho, and 4:
nalko - are similar to the ones found in Dravidian (Gondi/Kannada);
but not in either Indo-Aryan or Austric. Other numbers are taken
from Hindi.

An instance of multiplicative numeral can be seen in the
following example. It is obtained by suffixing –khyawa to the
numeral i:r/e:r ‘two’. But it is the only instance found to be
available in the data. For first biḍḍa:w is used, (made up of biḍi

quite different from Nihali system. Though both use suffixes
(loosely put), the elements as such except for sociative case, others
are very different. In both quite a bit of syncretization has taken
place. But the syncretization is independent to each language, so
differences are observed. In Nihali instrumental, dative and locative
have merged into one, ablative and sociative have merged into one,
and accusative and possessive have merged into one. So, effectively,
only three distinctions can be observed. On the other hand, in Korku
instrumental and ablative have merged into one, and dative and
locative have merged into one. So here syncretization is relatively
less as compared to the Nihali situation. Both the languages use
postpositions to some extent.
4.2.7. Numerals: An interesting feature of the language is that
except for the first few numbers, all other numbers are from IndoAryan. The interesting numbers for 3 are: mo:ṭho, 4: nalko, similar
words are in Dravidian, but not in either Indo-Aryan or Austric. The
numbers for 1 and 2 seem to be native words, without any
comparable forms in any language of the area.- biḍi/baḍa '1',141Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?ira:r/i:r '2' (eraḍu ‘2’ in Kannada; Khasi, a Mon-Khmer language

system of numerals; though younger generation tends to replace
them by IA numerals.","[150, 151, 152]"
"Here are some occupation-based terms. Most of them are
borrowed as can be observed. While forms without any suffix is
used for masculine forms; feminine forms are obtained by suffixing
ko:l, the feminine form. Also, plural form is obtained by suffixing
the plural marker –ta to the unmarked singular forms.
(20) kumbha:r ‘potter’ : kumbha:rna kollere ‘wife of potter’
sikko-ta ‘basket makers’ : sikko-ko:l ‘wife of basket maker’
sikko-nana-ta ‘children of basket maker’
dho:bi ‘washer man’: dho:bi-ko:l ‘washer man’s woman’
bhũ:y ‘fisherman’: bhũy-ko:l ‘fisherwoman’.
3.4. Pronouns
3.4.1. Personal pronouns: Nihali has only single set of personal
pronouns. The personal pronouns show three-way number
distinctions. :
(21)34The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularySg.","[44, 45]"
"Øhiṭkel-ta (ṭa)Here, the singular is unmarked, while the dual marker is hiṭkel;
and the plural marker is -ta. (nana 'boy' : nanata 'boys'). The dualChapter 3 / Grammar31form appears to be morefree rather than a suffix. Also, hiṭkel is used
with animate beings more commonly than with inanimate nouns
(though it can be used with the noun a:wa:r ‘house’). Though
theoretically inanimate nouns also can take the plural marker, often
in its place a quantifier is used.:
(14)biya: 'village' : biya:-ṭa 'villages',
anga:rko 'shirt' : anga:rko-ṭa 'shirts', or:
anga:rko-kho:bo/gayra 'many/a lot of shirts', etc.(15)(a) manso ‘man/person’ + -ta > manta ‘people’ (second
syllable is dropped before the suffix is added)
(b)gidar manta ‘lot of people’ as in :
iṭi sehar-ki gidar manta ‘that city’s lot of people ’,
(c) kamti manta ‘less people’:
he biya-ki kamti manta/manta kamti
‘this village (has) less people’.
(16) Sets of nouns involving number distinction can be shown:
a. biḍi-pirjo ‘one daughter’
e:r-pirjo-hiṭkel ‘two daughters’
kho:bo-piratta ‘many daughters’, piratta ‘daughters’ (pirjo +
-ta ‘pl.mark.’: second syllable of the noun is dropped before
the plural marker is suffixed to it. In the process the
consonant of the plural suffix gets geminated, and a vowel
gets added to make the structure pronounceable).
b. biḍi-nana ‘one son’
e:r-nana-hiṭkel ‘two sons’
kho:bo-nanaṭa ‘sons’ or nanaṭa ‘sons’
c.ma:w ‘horse’
e:r-ma:w-hiṭkel ‘two horses’32The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularykho:bo-ma:w-ṭa ‘many horses’ or: ma:wṭa ‘horses’
d. na:y ‘dog’
e:r-na:y-hiṭkel ‘two dogs’
kho:bo-na:y-ṭa ‘many/plenty of dogs’
e.a:wa:r ‘house’
e:r-a:wa:r-hiṭkel ‘two houses’
kho:bo-a:wa:r ‘many houses’
kho:bo a:wa:r-he:la ‘many houses’ (members) (he:la ‘plural
in animate nouns’).f.biḍi-ca:go ‘one stone’
e:r-ca:go ‘two stones’
kho:bo-ca:go ‘stones’ (*hiṭkel)3.3. Gender: The gender distinction is between masculine and
feminine in animate nouns. While masculine forms are usually
unmarked, feminine forms are obtained by adding (suffixing) a form
marking femininity, like ko:l 'female/woman': guru:ji '(he) teacher':
guru:ji-ko:l 'female teacher'. (An ambiguity is found here. The
previous example can mean either- 'female teacher' or 'wife of the
male teacher'. But context will clear this ambiguity). The 'female
marker (form)' can precede the noun instead of occurring after it.dho:bi-ko:l/ko:l-dho:bi 'washer man's wife', biya 'village' + a:ṭho
'man' > biya-a:ṭho 'man of the village'.
With animals also gender distinction can be shown if required.
Then to mark masculinity a separate form ja:gto is used, as follows:
(17)berko ‘cat’: ja:gto berko ‘male cat’ : ko:l berko ‘female cat’
na:y ‘dog’: ja:gto na:y ‘male dog’ : ko:l na:y ‘bitch’
cogom ‘pig’: ja:gto cogom ‘male pig’ : ko:l cogom ‘female
pig’Chapter 3 / Grammar33ja:gto 'male': ja:gto ṭembrya 'male tiger' : ko:l ṭembrya
'female tiger'
However, in case of cattle, there are separate lexical forms for
them, so above type of distinction is not normally made. For
instance:
(18)oḍow ‘(she) buffalo’ : hela ‘male buffalo’
dhor ‘cow’ : ḍoba ‘ox’.","[41, 42, 43, 44]"
"DualPl.1p.:jotye:koingi2p.:nena:kola3p.:eṭeyhiṭkeleṭey+la >
eṭeyla/ eṭlaAs can be observed from above, in the 1st person, the
singular, the dual and the plural forms are different from each other.
Though -ko might be interpreted as the dual marker, the dual base
form does not show any formal relationship with the singular form.
The plural form does not show the presence of any marker as such.
So the whole form has to be taken as a single morpheme standing134The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularyfor 1p plural. In 2nd person, dual form can be obtained from
suffixing -ko to the singular form ne-. But the plural form is entirely
different from either singular or dual form. The 3rd p. forms also
pose problems. Interestingly there is no distinction made in third
person singular based on genders. If needed, separate gender
markers are used. The dual form is quite different. It does not take
the dual suffix -ko, which is used in both 1st and 2nd persons.
Further the plural form is complex as it is made up of eṭey 3p.sg.
form and 2p. plural for la.
In Korku the personal pronouns have two sets of forms,
independent and suffixal forms. The suffixal forms are the
shortened forms of the independent forms. That way they are
different from Nihali forms as such a distinction is not found in that
language. Also, Korku has a distinction between 'inclusive' vs.
'exclusive' distinction in dual and plural forms of the first person,
which are not found in Nihali. The following situation is found.:Sg.

[ḍi-ku]Beyond the structural similarities as far as personal pronouns are
concerned, there are many differences between these two languages.
In possessive pronouns except for first person singular, same
personal pronouns are used. In 1st person: enge 'my'. Elsewhere
possessive is marked partially by one of these -n, -na, and Ø (zero).-135Chapter 4 / Is Nihali, an Isolate?ne:-a:wa:r

"3.7.7. Transitive formation: Transitive is a two-place predicate,
having an agent and the object; while the intransitive is a one placepredicate. The underlying object of one place-predicate acts as the
subject. It is an intransitive. In many other cases if the verb itself is
of transitive type, kamay is not needed. For instance:Chapter 3 / Grammar83(124)(a) iṭimanso tandur ṭye
that-man rice eat-pt
‘that man ate rice’,
here the verb ‘eat’ is transitive, so does not take kamay. Similarly
the verb ber- ‘to cut’, as in the following:
(b) eṭey cekṭo-ki a:ḍḍon beri
he axe-with tree-obj cut-pt
‘he cut a tree with axe’
The verb ‘give’ is a three-place predicate with Ag, object and
recipient, as in the following:
(125) (a) nana pirjo-ki patra be-e
Ag1 Ag2
Obj3 V
boy girl-to
letter give-pt
‘boy gave a letter to the girl’.
(b) ḍa:ktar mantaki sũy-i be:ka
Ag1
Ag2
Obj3
V
doctor people-to injection/needle gives
‘doctor gives injection to people’.
An intransitive verb is converted by using another verb kamay ‘to
do’ to obtain a transitive verb, as can be seen above. Similarly, in
the following sets:
(126) (a) joppo raban-ka ‘water is cold’, as it has only one argument,
the object. While the following:
(b) jo joppona rabankamay
I water-obj cool-ed
‘I cooled the water’.
It has an agent as well as an object. So it is transitive.","[93, 94]"
"30The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabulary3.1.3. Derivation of nouns: Many verbs can be converted into nouns
by suffixing noun derivative suffixes, like –re, agentive singular
marker, or –hela ‘plural marker’; and also gender marking forms
like ko:l ‘woman, female’, a:ṭho ‘man, male’.

"3.11. Reduplication/Echo formation/Onomatopoeic expressions
(A) Reduplication is not very productive in this language. However,
verbs are repeated wholly, by which intensification or continuity of
an action is expressed. This is a very regular process. There are a
few formal repetitions, but are not functional in nature. For instance:
(170) jikit-kon bhuy-bhuy ‘eye lash’, jikit dhura-dhura ‘eye brow’.
While jikit means ‘eye’, the other part has to be taken as a
whole, though they have reduplicative structure. There are a
few more such instances in the language.: ti:r-ti:r ‘a bird’s
name’, etc.
(a) Repeating a verb provides a sense of intensification of the
action concerned. For instance:
(171) mer- ‘to play’: mer-mer-ka
engki agin
bi
play-play-emp me-to sweat come-pt
‘playing-playing sweat came to me’pa:ṭo ‘to come’ : pa:ṭo-pa:ṭo-(ka)/ pa:ṭpa:ṭo ‘while
coming/returning’
bhum ‘to walk’ : bhum-bhum-ka ‘by walking-walking’
bhum-ja-bhum-ja ‘went-went’
kappo ‘to sleep’: kappo-kappo bi:ma:ri ‘by sleeping-sleeping
(sub.) became sick’
cippo ‘to stand’: cippo-cippo :
jo cippo-cippo enge khuri lawa:y104The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and VocabularyI stand-stand my leg pain-pt
‘I standing-standing my legs got tired’.
tukra- ‘to cut’: tukra-tukra kama:ka
‘will cut into pieces-pieces’
hunga(:)yn ‘to remain/stay’:
hunga:yn-hunga:yn
manner’‘continueto remain/stay in samekarta: ‘to keep doing (something for living)’:
karta:-karta: ‘living-living= living so for sometime’=
‘gradually’
(b) Nouns can be reduplicated, particularly as addressing terms. For
instance:
(172) pirjo ‘girl’: pirjo-pirjo ‘girl-girl’= ‘dear/O girl’
parda:n ‘minister’: parda:n-parda:n ‘O minister-minister’
ma:y ‘mother’: ma:y-ma:y ‘mother-mother’
ra:ja ‘king’: ra:ja-ra:ja ‘O king’
sika:ri ‘hunter’: sika:ri-sika:ri ‘hunter-hunter’
musaphir-musaphir ‘stranger-stranger’
kaggo ‘mouth’:
kaggo-kaggo-kon jhagṛa
mouth-mouth-by quarrel
‘quarrel by mouth-mouth only’
osol ‘to boil’: osol-osol-ka ‘boiling’:
osol-osolka joppo pura: poporka jerey
boil-boil-ing water totally black happen
‘by over boiling water total black happened’
(c) Adjectives can be reduplicated, as can be seen below.:Chapter 3 / Grammar105(173) cacko ‘hot’: cacko-cacko, as in :
iṭan / ba:raka meyna cacko-cacko-ka hunga:ynka
that-in twelve-emp month hot-hot-def remain-emp
‘In that (the food) will remain hot-hot for fully for twelve
months’

going for toilet)’
beḍe-beḍe ‘one-one different-different’
tere-tere ca:n-ta ‘different-different kinds of fishes’
lici-lici ‘very sharp’
alag-alag (rango) ‘different-different’ (colours)
(d) Adverbials are commonly reduplicated.:
(174) uṭhwã:-uṭhwã: iṭi bakko riṭa:ya
thatway-thatway that finger opened
‘just like that that finger got opened’
kusi-kusi e:ri ‘very happily went’ (kusi ‘happy’)

sele-sele ‘to flow slowly’(e.g. water)
basel-basel ‘small-small’ as in :
a:po basel-basel kama:be
‘cut firewood into small-small pieces’
bha:gel-bha:gel ‘big-big’ as in :
a:po bha:gel-bha:gel lamba wokkibe
firewood big-big long piece keep-imp
‘keep firewood in long big-big pieces’106The Nihali Language: Grammar, Texts and Vocabularybar-bar kidani ‘speaking indistinctly’
hombo-hombo… ‘on all four limbs’(like a child)- crawling’
Also:
(175) (a:wa:r) mija:r-mija:r-ki
(house) middle-middle –in
‘in the very middle (of the house)’(mija:r ‘middle’)
Verb can be used as an adverb by repeating it and placing it before
the main verb, as below.:
(176) ha:go ‘smile’:
eṭey ha:go-ha:go ma:nḍi
he smile-smile speak-pt
‘he spoke smilingly’
(e) Reflexive form hone can be reduplicated. Also, an element –jyucan be inserted within the repeated form as well. By that
voluntariness is emphasized. With reduplication it gets emphasized.
(This is the only instance of this kind available in the data).
(177) jo honeka a:ra:y ‘ I myself saw’
eṭey honehoneka likhaṭi:ni
he self-self-emp write-pt
‘he wrote himself-emp.’
eṭey hone-jyu-hone
ra:mki ḍa:m be-e
he
self-self (volun.) ram-to money give-pt
‘he on his own gave money to Ram’.
(B) Echo forms, do not appear to be native to this speech form.
Whatever is found seems to have come from Korku. As can be seen
below, there are two subtypes. First, those which involve change of
initial consonant only in the repeated part; and the second, which
involves vowel change in the repeated part. But the first one is an107Chapter 3 / Grammarinstance which has both consonantal as well as vocalic change in the
repeated part. Also, there is no commonness between the consonant
changes; while in case of vocalic changes always the first (base)
vowel is [a], and in the reduplicated part it changes to either [u] or
[o] only.
