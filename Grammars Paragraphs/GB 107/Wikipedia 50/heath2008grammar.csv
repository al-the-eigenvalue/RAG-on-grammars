Negative la$˘, which is very common after ‘it is’ clitic y$ (§11.2.1.3), is also
used after a proposition-expressing clause, in (polarity-reversed) tag-question
function. One text, from an elderly man addressing a much younger interviewer,
was full of uptake-checking expressions, including (763).

‘We saw how the whites used to do it, didn’t we? If we don’t abandon

version of the initial proposition, reduced to its inflected verb. In (765), the
speaker bemoans the fact that young women of the village often go to cities to
work, and come back pregnant. The tag reverses the negative polarity of the
primary proposition.","[484, 485]"

11.2.1.3 ‘It is not …’ (y$ la$˘)
The great majority of textual occurrences of la$˘ occur in the combination [Xy$
la$˘] ‘it is not X’, where la$˘ negates a predication with the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (or
allomorph). ci@ni^˘ la$˘ ‘it is not thus’ is an example. Further examples, with an
NP as complement of ‘it is’, are in (654); see also (310), (360.a.b), (491.c),

‘The grains that it (=millet ear) has put (=has grown), they are not

antecedent clause [Xy$ la$˘ de$y] ‘if it is not X’, with dey ‘if’ (§16.4). Freer
translations, depending on context, can include ‘unless it is X’, ‘other than X’,
‘instead of X’, or ‘far from (being) X’. The position of X may be filled by a
sentence, NP, or adverbial. With accompanying negated clause, we get e.g.
‘[there is nothing] [if it is not X]’, or more freely ‘there is only X’. Some
examples of [Xy$ la$˘ de$y] are in (655); see also (392.b).

With implied but unexpressed double-negative, [Xy$ la$˘ de$y] can mean
‘nothing if not X’, which logically reduces to ‘only (=exclusively) X’. The
predilection in Jamsay for such double negations to express ‘only’ accounts for
the relatively low text frequency of the ‘only’ particle sa&y (§19.4.1). In (656),
for example, ‘eloping’ is not really a truth-conditional subset of ‘tying
(=contracting) marriage’. The logically complete version would be ‘there was
no contracting marriage; (there was no marriage) if it was not (=other than)
eloping’, but the parenthesized clause is omitted.

With nonzero pronominal suffix, both a long-voweled type with la$˘- and a
short-voweled type with la$- are attested.
Most examples have the short-voweled form la$-. In this construction, the
y$ clitic has the ‘it is’ (copular) function. The clitic may or may not also be
conjugated. In (657), only the Negative morpheme is conjugated.

By contrast, in (658), both y$ ‘it is’ and the Negative morpheme are
conjugated. Since ba^˘< ‘owner’ is vowel-final, the relevant instance of y$ is
phonologically fused with 2Sg suffix -w as w$ (then nasalized to w$<).

Negative la$˘ was originally contour-toned. This would account for the long

express the second tone component without lengthening the vowel; see
Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141).
The type with long-voweled la$˘- occurred in elicitation (660). My assistant
consistently pronounced the long vowel, in contrast to the short vowel of the
preceding examples. The ‘it is’ clitic itself is not conjugated here. I suggest that
the difference between the two constructions is that in the long-voweled type,
the clitic y$ is the Focus marker (or perhaps jointly ‘it is’ and Focus).

and the Negative would be long-voweled la$˘, as in (655.b), above.
L-toned la$ is perhaps identical morphemically to Negative la@- with statives
(§11.4.3), rather than to the long-voweled la$˘ found after y$. If so, the tonedropping is due to predicate defocalization, as is reasonable after a (naturally
focal) ‘only’ phrase.","[428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"
"10.1.3 Negation of indicative verbs
10.1.3.1 Categories expressed by negative verbs
In both perfective and imperfective systems, there is a clear tendency to reduce
the relatively complex system of positive AN categories to just two in the
negative.
Perfective Negative -li@- replaces several positive forms: unsuffixed and
marked Perfective, Resultative, and (for the most part) the reduplicated Perfective and the Recent Perfective. Rarely, -li@- is added directly to a reduplicated
Perfective, or to Recent Perfect -jE$-. The only AN suffix that is regularly
retained before -li@- is Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$- ; the combination is pronounced -tE$-li@- for expected #-tE$l-li@- (§10.1.3.2).
Imperfective Negative -go@- replaces the unsuffixed Imperfective and the
reduplicated Imperfective. It also normally replaces the marked Imperfective
and the Habitual; alternatively, their positive forms are directly followed by
stative Negative -la@- (§11.4.3).

‘Be sick’ is regularly expressed as the negation of ‘be healthy’ (sE@llE@-), as
in sE$llE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you-Sg are sick’.
Although the negative morpheme appears with the verb at the extreme right
of the clause, it typically has wide scope. In (580), for example, ç@ƒç@rç@ ‘quickly’
is under the scope of the negation.","[388, 389]"
"2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs11Negation is also expressed by verbal suffixation; there are distinct Negative
suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs, immediately preceding the
pronominal suffixes (hence verb-Neg-pronominal); see §10.1.3. Examples of
positive inflected verbs are in (3.a-b), followed by examples of negative
inflected verbs (3.c-d). Note the zero 3SgS suffix in (3.b).

‘We did not go.’As the interlinear glosses in (3.c-d) suggest, the verbal suffixal system
marks aspect as well as negation; I refer to these as AN (aspect-negation)
categories. The positive categories are listed in (4); the fuller treatment is in
§10.1.2. The division between the two systems is justified by semantics and
textual patterning. For example, the unsuffixed Perfective (in the syntactic
contexts that require it) may correspond to any of several marked perfectivesystem categories in other contexts, and the unsuffixed Imperfective is likewise
the unmarked, all-purpose imperfective-system form. Similar neutralizations
occur in negative AN categories.","[32, 33]"

and the response is called for. In other contexts, ‘I have not searched’ would
appear in simple Perfective Negative form as lu$gu$ro$-lu@-m ‘I did not search’.
PerfNeg -li@- does combine readily with the Experiental Perfect (‘have not
ever’). This is the usual way to express ‘never’. Here the Experiential Perfect
suffix -tE@rE$- is truncated to -tE- before -li@-, resulting in -tE$-li@-. The PerfNeg
suffix forces L-tone on both the ExpPf suffix and the preceding verb stem. The
irregularity in the form of -E@˘- ‘see’ with ExpPf suffix in the positive (E@t-tE@rE@instead of #E@˘-tE@rE@-) is carried over into the negative.

a$ƒa$-tE$-lu@-m ‘I have never heard’10.1.3.3 Negation of reduplicated perfective-system verbs
Reduplicated perfectives cannot normally be directly negated.
A reduplicated Perfective of a stative stance verb, e.g. i $-i@jE$- ‘be standing’,
is negated by adding the usual stative Negative suffix -la@- to the unreduplicated
stem, as in i j$ E$-la@-ba@ ‘they are not standing’. Likewise with adjectival verbs,
e.g. reduplicated positive ji -$ jo^˘- ‘be many’, negative jo$˘-la@- ‘not be many’.
A reduplicated Perfective of an active verb, e.g. ti -$ tE@mE$-w< ‘you-Sg
found’, normally has a simple (unreduplicated) Perfective Negative counterpart:
tE$mE$-lu@˘-Ø ‘you-Sg did not find’. However, in parallelistic positive-negative
sequences, a reduplicated Perfective Negative is possible.
For reduplicated Perfective ci -$ ce@˘ne$- ‘be well done, be good’, the normal
negative counterpart is the simple, unreduplicated Perfective Negative, as in
ce$˘ne$-li@-Ø ‘it is not well done, it is not good’. However, for this verb there is
also a parallelistic positive-negative construction, functioning as a “willy-nilly”
conditional antecedent (§16.3), that adds L-toned Negative -li $- to the
reduplicated Perfective stem (with no tone-dropping).","[390, 391]"

"11.4.3 Negative adjectival and stative predicates (-la@-)
The usual negative counterpart of kç$ and wç$- in adjectival predicates is -la@-,
which (like other Negative inflectional suffixes) induces tone-dropping on the
preceding stem. The ‘be’ quasi-verb is omitted.

‘The kinds are not the same.’ (tu@ru@) 2004.3.27
This Negative -la@- should be distinguished from 3Pl Perfective Negative
-l-a@ (arguably contracted from /-li@-ba@/). It is also distinct from la$˘, a higherlevel Negative used after clitic y$ ‘it is’ (§11.2.1.3).
-la@- is also used as an aspectually undifferentiated Negative suffix for
imperfective-system verbs, when added to a verb already suffixed with -tç@ƒç$(marked Imperfective) or -a@˘ra$- (Habitual); see (586-7) in §10.1.3.4. It is also
the only Negative suffix for stative stance verbs (‘be sitting’, ‘be standing’, ‘be
lying down’), see (694) and (695.d) in §11.2.4. Similarly, it is the only Negative
suffix for defective ‘have’ verbs ji n
$ e$- and je$re$-, see (717.a-b) and (718.c) in
§11.5.2).
For adverbials, which only rarely take other than Nonhuman subject, the
usual negation is formed with kç$˘-rç@ ‘it is not’, as in (711.a). With adjectives,
this construction was elicitable, as with wç$˘-rç@- in (711.b) but did not occur
spontaneously. Either kç$˘-rç@ or wç$˘-rç@- may drop tones, suggesting that they
may be defocalized (a phenomenon associated with the unsuffixed Perfective of
verbs).

11.5.1‘Have’ (sa$-)This is another defective verb. It should be distinguished from the regular verb
sa@˘- ‘reply’, which has a long vowel. In positive main clauses, ‘have’ occurs
only in the unsuffixed Perfective stem sa$-, and I cite it in this form. An11.5 Possessive predicates435H-toned form sa@- is arguably lexically basic, though it actually occurs as such
only in lexical-stem pseudo-participial sa@-n (§3.7.1.1, §15.1.1.3).
In simple possessive predications of the type ‘X have Y’, we have a straight
transitive construction with the possessor as subject and the possessed entity as
direct object. In positive sentences, Existential yE@ is present, preceding sa$-.
Examples of such ‘X have Y’ clauses are (295.a) and (486) among many others.
‘Have’ is used as an inflectable auxiliary with a number of nouns (often of
Fulfulde or other foreign origin) that denote states or qualities. Thus ‘have
nastiness’ = ‘be nasty’ and so forth. The cases in (712) show yE@ as in canonical
possessive predicates.

The Participial stem of sa$- is sa^-, with the usual H(H…)L overlaid
perfective tone. With zero (Nonhuman) suffix, Contour-Tone Mora-Addition

it competes with ‘owner of X’ compounds (§5.1.12). The 3Sg subject form
sa$˘-ra@-Ø can be used idiomatically, with a preceding main-like clause (i.e.
factive complement), in the sense ‘it doesn’t matter (much) that’; see §17.3.5.
The combination of -sa$˘-ra@ with a preceding nominal stem forms occasional
compounds of the general meaning ‘lack of X’ (§5.1.4).
No causative or pseudo-causative forms could be elicited of positive sa$- or
its negative counterpart.
11.5.2 ‘Have possession of’ verbs (ji $ne@-, je$re@-)
The verb ji $ne@- is a regular verb with the full spectrum of AN stems in the sense
‘hold’ or ‘keep’. It may also be used as a verb of custodial possession, ‘have
possession of’, in which case it approaches sa$- in function but puts more
emphasis on (perhaps temporary) physical possession or control. Three
syntactic features characterize the possessive use of ji $ne@-.","[455, 456, 457, 458]"

As the preceding sections have shown, the verb preceding a Participial suffix
has the same form (including tone contour) that it has in main clauses
(preceding a subject pronominal suffix), across a wide range of positive and
negative AN categories.
However, in the positive perfective, the unsuffixed Perfective is almost
always used in participles instead of the suffixally marked Perfective (with
suffix -ti $-, -ya$-/-yE$-, or -a^˘-). Moreover, the unsuffixed Perfective takes a
special form in participles (i.e. in relative clauses), characterized by an498Relativization… )L tonal overlay (829). (This contour is also found in relative clauses

and some other subordinated clauses (829).

"13.2.1 Clause-final interrogative particles
13.2.1.1 Polar (yes/no) interrogative ma
The polar interrogative clause-final particle is (atonal) ma. It is arguably
identical to the disjunctive particle ma ‘or’ (§7.2.1). If this equation is correct, it
raises the interesting question whether one sense (interrogative or disjunctive) is
basic. In German, oder ‘if’ is often added to a statement as a kind of polar tag
question marker: Du hast schon gegessen, oder? ‘you have already eaten, or?’.
If the disjunctive sense is taken as basic in Jamsay, then we have a possible
structural parallel to the German construction, functioning however as the basic
polar-question construction. Since the final ‘or’ (in this interpretation) is the
truncation of a fuller version of the (polarized) second clause (‘you have already
eaten, or [sc. you have not yet eaten]?’), this would account for the typical
nonterminal intonation of the Jamsay particle (see below). On the other hand, a
disjunction of the type ‘X or Y’ could be taken as a kind of question in many
contexts: compare ‘X or Y will come’ with ‘(I wonder whether) X will come,
(or) Y will come’. Moreover, many polar questions involve disjunctions: ‘Will
X or Y come?’.
However, a complete identification of the polar-question and disjunctive
particles is doubtful. It will be seen below that ma is also optionally used after
WH-interrogatives, which are not interpretable as disjunctions.
The Jamsay particle appears with variable pitch and duration. In my
interpretation, it is subject first to Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137),
which extends the preceding phonological tone into the particle, resulting in ma@
or ma$. Of these, ma$ is more common (at least at the end of full clauses), since
positive inflected verbs all end in L-tones. After this rule applies, the particle is
then frequently (but not obligatorily) subject to intonational modification, in
the form either of prolongation (), pitch-raising (), or both ().
Whether intonationally raised or not, the pitch is often steady-state during
the articulation of the particle. However, I have occasionally observed a slowly
falling pitch that I indicate with symbols , similar to the dying-quail
intonation (symbol ).
In polar interrogatives, the corresponding reverse-polarity statement, or

"13 Focalization and interrogation13.1 Focalization
Focalization is a fundamental process in Jamsay morphosyntax, but it is
somewhat elusive. In the usual case, an NP or adverbial is highlighted
(focused), whereupon the remainder of the clause and in particular the verb is
automatically defocalized. I distinguish a marked focalization construction
from an unmarked one, based on the form of the highlighted constituent itself.
In both marked and unmarked constructions, verbs in the perfective positive
appear in the unsuffixed Perfective form, with stem-wide L-tone, rather than in
a form with overt Perfective suffix. Perfective Negative and the Imperfective
Negative verbs also show stem-wide L-tone (including the AN suffix) in
focalization constructions. This tone-dropping may be interpreted iconically as
a prosodic manifestation of verb defocalization. No tone-dropping applies to
the unmarked Imperfective, or to any verb with overt positive AN suffixation.
In subject focalization, there is no pronominal-subject suffix on the verb
(the subject is always expressed overtly earlier in the sentence). In all types of
non-subject focalization, the usual pronominal-subject suffix appears on the
verb.
In the marked construction, in addition to the aforementioned defocalization of perfective verbs, the focalized constituent hosts the Focus clitic y$,
or its allomorph i $˘ (sometimes i^˘ after tone sandhi). This clitic is also added
to NPs and other constituents in the ‘it is’ (i.e., copula) construction (§11.2.1).
As a result, the marked focalization construction resembles English clefts of the
type ‘it’s you (e.g. not that other woman) that I love’.
In the unmarked construction, we get the verb defocalization described
above, and there is a focal constituent (e.g. ci@n ‘like that’), but the latter is not
overtly marked with the clitic y$.
Since verb defocalization has audible effects on the stem only with perfective and negative verbs, and since the 3Sg pronominal-subject suffix is -Ø,
the unmarked focalization construction is indistinguishable from unfocalized
clauses when the verb is imperfective positive and the subject is 3Sg.
Quite often in Jamsay discourse, a topic is presented first, followed by
sentence containing a pronominalized or otherwise reduced variant thereof in
focalized form. Schematic examples to give the flavor of this strategy: a) ‘meat,
that’s what I like’, b) ‘we sow seeds early, that’s how we farm’. Real examples
are in (744). In (744.a), the parallel segments are aligned. Note the absence of13.1 Focalization455pronominal-subject marking (3Pl -ba$) on the defocalized verbs in the subjectfocus example (744.a), and the presence of a pronominal-subject suffix (1Sg
-m) in the non-subject-focus example (744.b).

ungrammaticality of English #It’s meat [focus] that it is, in contrast to the
grammatical Meat [focus] is what it is. In (745), the focused constituent is the
complement of the preposition ‘in’. The entire PP is the complement of the
external y$ ‘it is/was’. The construction is rare, but my assistant found it
grammatical.

In subject focalization, there is no subject pronominal suffix on the verb.
There is also no participial suffix of the sort found in relative clauses. This lack
of suffixation is a useful diagnostic, except for 3Sg subject which has -Ø suffix
anyway. The subject X is always overtly expressed earlier in the clause, either
as unmarked [X] or in the form [Xy$] with the Focus clitic. If the subject is
pronominal, it appears in preverbal position in its H-toned independent form,456Focalization and interrogationwith or without Focus y$. A perfective (positive) verb takes the L-toned

"12.2 Symmetrical comparatives
Symmetrical comparatives equate the scalar positions of the two comparanda.
Some of them occur most often under negation, the overall construction then
functioning as an asymmetrical comparison.
12.2.1 Predicative adjective with ji@n ‘like’
One semantically symmetrical comparative involves ji@n ‘like’ following the
comparandum. A following predicative adjective is regularly L-toned
(defocalized) in this combination. Pronominal-subject inflection is added
directly to the predicate adjective, with no ‘be’ quasi-verb.

A construction of the type [ADJx-la$ƒa@ ADJx-Neg] is used with adjectives to
mean ‘it’s not very (not particularly) ADJ’. There is no overt comparandum,
and the construction merely emphasizes that the entity in question is only
moderately characterized by the quality. -la$ƒa@ is invariant, while the negated
second adjective may be conjugated. Since it is part of a bipartite construction,
it is difficult to gloss -la$ƒa@ precisely; I use ‘so.much’ in interlinears.

12.2.3 ‘Equal; be as good as’ (ba&˘-)
ba&˘- can function as a transitive verb meaning ‘suffice, be enough for (sb)’, in a
full range of perfective and imperfective forms: mi@ ba&˘kç$ ‘it’s enough for me’,
mi@ ba$˘-go@-Ø ‘it isn’t enough for me.’
A homophone (or specialized offshoot) of this verb is used in comparatives,
in the perfective system only, in the sense ‘be as much as, equal’. It competes
with dç@˘- (do@˘-) ‘approach, attain’ in this sense; see §12.2.4, below. Unlike the
quasi-verbs and other stative verbs that are confined to the perfective system,
ba&˘- takes regular perfective system suffixes, including Resultative -sa$- and
Perfective Negative -li@- (rather than stative Negative -la@-). However, the
perfective forms are used for any time frame, and no morphologically
imperfective forms occur. For example, Imperfective Negative #ba$˘-go@- (in the
relevant sense) was rejected.
ba&˘ may be chained to a following VP that expresses the substance of the
comparison. In the absence of such a VP, the default interpretation is ‘be as
good as’. In most examples, ba&˘ occurs in negative clauses (‘not equal X’ =
‘be/do less than X’), but it may occur in positive clauses as well (740.d).","[471, 472]"

‘not be’ (nonhuman, sometimes human)The unusual combination of lengthened first vowel and Negative -rv@(instead of the usual Perfective Negative -li@-) is elsewhere observed only with
‘have’ (positive -sa$-, negative sa$˘-ra@-, §11.5.1). These quasi-verbs are limited to
the perfective system, so they allow no morphological distinction between
Perfective Negative and Imperfective Negative. In this respect they are like
adjectival predicates, which have a single Negative (not marked for aspect) -la@-.
The phonological similarity between -rv@- and -la@- is historically suggestive.

kç$˘-rç@ in particular is very common in double negations of the type ‘any

construction, kç$˘-rç@ is usually generalized to human as well as nonhuman
reference: ‘anyone who didn’t go, he/it doesn’t exist (kç$˘-rç@)’ = ‘everyone
went’. See §14.1.2.
There is no causative of wç$- or kç$ in any sense.
11.2.2.4 Existential quasi-verbs (kç$, sometimes wç$-) with yç@
The form kç$, which as a locational predicator requires nonhuman reference, is
often extended to human categories in the ‘there is/are’ construction (existential). In positive main clauses, kç$ is cliticized to Existential yç@ (assimilated
from yE@, §11.2.2.1).

us (here).’ (i.e., they brought us here to settle without asking anyone
else for permission) 2004.3.11 [excerpt from (1113.b)]We can boil this down structurally to the sequence of two VPs followed by
a full clause: [[anyone ask] [us bring] [(us) put-3Pl-Neg]]. The three verbs are
‘ask’, ‘bring’, and ‘put’, with only ‘put’ inflected for negation (and 3Pl subject).
However, the context makes it clear that the bringing and the putting did occur,
while the asking did not. In English, this is best expressed with without in the
negated VP. In the absence of a clause-level ‘without’ construction, the speaker
negated the final verb in the chain, leaving it to the listener to apply contextual
knowledge to piece together the sense. The same text includes other verb-chain
negations of the same type, in the same context (i.e. not first getting permission
before settling). See (907.d) in §15.1.16, below, with linker ti@ rather than me$y<.","[552, 553]"

For the difference between the two {HL} overlays, H(H…)L and H(L…)L,
see §3.7.2.3, below.
Tone-dropping may also apply at word-level, i.e. to the unit consisting of a
verb plus its AN and/or pronominal suffixes. This is observable with
Imperfective Negative -go@- and Perfective Negative -li@-, which (like the
positive unsuffixed Perfective) may appear in a word-level L-toned form (i.e.
with -go$- or -li -$ ) when aspect is defocalized. Similarly, participles that include
lexical or grammatical H-tone components drop these tones before modifying
elements that regularly force tone-dropping on a preceding modified noun, e.g.
ka^˘< ‘any, each’; see e.g. (843.a-c) in §14.1.18.
There is one Tone-Grafting process applicable to verbs.
(116)Tone-Grafting for Verbs
unsuffixed Imperfective (positive): floating (unassociated) L-tone is
added as a suffix after the final segment of the verb stem (before any
pronominal-subject suffix)Inflectable verb stems are either monosyllabic Cv@˘- or Cv&˘-, or longer stems
ending in …Cv@-. The unsuffixed Imperfective equivalents are Cv^˘- (F-tone),
Cv&˘ $- (<LHL> tone), and /…Cv^-/, respectively; the latter is lengthened to …Cv^˘before a zero suffix by Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141).
The general formula for an inflected verb is [verb + AN + pronominalsubject], where AN is an aspect-negation suffix. The pronominal suffixes themselves have no intrinsic tones. Instead, the preceding tone extends into the
pronominal suffix. The same is true of nonzero Participial suffixes, which are
simply the usual nominal suffixes (Sg -n, Pl -m) added to verbs. See AtonalMorpheme Tone-Spreading (137) in §3.7.3.5, below.","[126, 127]"

case of demonstrative ko$ ‘that’ not modifying a following noun.
pi@li@we@- is a common verb meaning ‘return, go back’. As a nonfinal verb in
a chain, pi@li@we@ may usually be glossed ‘again’. However, it may be stretched
into a distinct adverbial sense close to ‘furthermore’. In (1167), I render it with
the English verb ‘proceed to’, suggesting a sequence of actions.

marked Imperfective in -tç@ƒç$-, and the reduplicated Imperfective. However,
-a@˘ra$- and -tç@ƒç$- may also be followed directly by (stative) Negative -la@(§11.4.3), with no tone-dropping of the stem or of the inner AN suffix. This
suggests that -la@- in this combination is phonologically peripheral to the
preceding stem, unlike the case with other AN suffixes. See also discussion of

Corresponding to Perfective in -ti -$ , -yE$-/-ya$-, or -a^˘-, the unsuffixed Perfective,

Examples of positive/negative correspondences are in (581). When the

"10.4.3 Hortative (-m@)
The Hortative has an H-toned suffix -m@, following a verb stem with all-L tones.
The high-frequency form ya$-m@ ‘let’s go!’ has a short vowel, but other Cv˘verbs retain their lexical long vowel: go$˘-m@ ‘let’s go out!’, ja$˘<-m@ ‘let’s dig!’,
nç$˘-m@ ‘let’s drink!’. The hortative does not occur with short-voweled Cv- or
CvC- quasi-verbs (wç$- ‘be’, sa$- ‘have’, ku$n- ‘be in’, see §11.2 and §11.5),
perhaps for semantic as well as morphological reasons. Defective stance verbs
like da$˘<- ‘be sitting’ (§11.2.4) also lack hortatives. This is reasonable, since an
exhortation to action naturally calls for an active verb subject to volitional
control, as in di N
$ e$-m@ ‘let’s sit down!’ (verb di N
$ e@-). I have also been unable to
elicit hortatives based directly on adjectives like jE@m ‘black’ in predicative
function, though hortatives can be elicited from inchoative verbs like jE$m-nE@‘become black’, and from combinations with ‘be’ verbs like be@˘-.
I transcribe e.g. ya$-m@ with the H-tone marker on the suffixal C. A
representation ya&-m would convey the pronunciation, given my transcription
conventions, but ya$-m@ brings out the fact that the rising tone is determined by
the suffix, not by the lexical tone of the stem.
The Hortative is distinguishable (by this tone pattern) from another suffix
-m used in ‘so that …’ and ‘had better’ clauses, with the lexical tone of the verb
(§17.6.4). Hortative -m@ should also be distinguished from two atonal -m
suffixes, 1Sg subject -m and Pl Participial -m.
If speaker and (singular) addressee are involved, i.e. in the first person
inclusive dual context, there is no further suffixation. Therefore the form in -m@
is basically a first inclusive dual hortative, though it may extend loosely to
include larger numbers (see below). The 1Pl pronoun E@mE@ is optionally
preposed, which avoids any possible ambiguity with 1Sg unsuffixed
Perfectives. Examples are in (602). As with the Imperative, only the final verb
in a verb-chain takes Hortative form (602.a-b).

2004.3.1When the subject in this construction is pronominal, it must be expressed as
an independent third-person pronoun (3Sg wo@, 3Pl be@, Nonh ko@), rather than
as an L-toned preverbal subject or as a pronominal-subject suffix on the verb.
This is seen in (609.a). Moreover, the reflexive-possessor construction may
not be used; if there is a direct object possessed by the relevant third person, it
appears with regular third person possessor (e.g. 3Sg wo@) rather than with
Reflexive possessor E$nE@ ma$ (§18.1.2). This is illustrated in (609.b).

Instead, the third-person “subject” is best taken as an indirect second person,
representing the imposition of the current deictic organization on an
“underlying” or virtual 2Sg (or 2Pl) pronoun. The “subject” can be taken as
vocative in function, even though the “addressee” is typically not present.
Schematically, ‘(hey) you, come!’ is converted into “(hey) him, come!” In
(609.b) and (610.b), the “reflexive possessor” likewise results from converting
an “underlying” 2Sg (or 2Pl) possessor pronoun to third person to conform to
the current deictic center. Schematically, ‘(hey) you, eat your mango!’ is
converted to ‘(hey) him, eat his mango!’ Since there is no overtly reflexive
marking for second person possessor (as in ‘you ate [your mango]’), there is no
reflexive marking after the conversion to third person, even though a true third
person construction (‘he ate [his (own) mango]’) does require an overtly
reflexive possessor pronominal.
Nothing blocks Logophoric pronominalization in the same constructions, as
long as the logophoric antecedent is the author of the command or wish (611).

A first-person “imperative” is used as a query as to whether the addressee wants
the speaker to do something. The presence of the interrogative particle ma (ma@,
ma$) at the end indicates that this is not a true, addressee-directed imperative. A10.4 Imperatives and hortatives385first person independent pronoun may be added at the beginning, in “topic”

This construction is typically used when the speaker did not clearly hear

clear(er) instructions. In local French, this is expressed with de plus infinitive:

Q11 VP and predicate structure11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure
11.1.1 Verb types (forms)
Inflectable verb stems (including derivational but not AN suffixes) are
predominantly of the following shapes (the initial C is optional): Cv˘-, CvCv-,
Cv˘Cv-, and CvCvCv- (rarely CvCvCvCv-). There are a modest number of
CvCCv- stems of native Dogon origin, generally reflecting syncope from
*CvCvCv-, and there are quite a few verbs borrowed from Fulfulde with shapes
like CvCCv-. For patterns of vocalic harmony applicable to verbs, see §3.4.5.
I use the term quasi-verbs to denote any of a small set of predicative
elements, with specialized grammatical functions, that have the extra-short
shape Cv- or in one case CvC-. Several of these (jE$-, sa$-, wç$-, kç$-, ku$n-) are
limited to the unsuffixed Perfective in positive clauses. That is, they are
followed (in positive utterances) only by pronominal-subject suffixes. Except
for jE$-, which is positive only, the quasi-verbs also have irregular, aspectually
undifferentiated negative forms.
jE$- ‘say’ and sa$- ‘have’ can arguably be identified morphemically with
aspectual suffixes (Recent Perfect -jE$-, Resultative -sa$-). This raises the
possibility that they are AN suffixes in the special case where the preceding
verb-stem slot is phonologically empty.
On the other hand, wç$- and kç$- ‘exist’, which are differentiated as human
and nonhuman, have a striking resemblance to third person pronominal wo@
(human singular) and ko@ (nonhuman), respectively. In addition, a clitic kç$$ is
used for Nonhuman subject in the unsuffixed Imperfective. This suggests that
quasi-verbs wç$- and kç$- ‘exist’ might be pronominals, or more specifically
(imperfective) pronominal-agreement morphemes, again following a
phonologically empty verb-stem slot. ku$n- ‘be in’, with its unique CvC- shape,
functions (in part) as an irregular, and semantically specialized, passive of the
common verb ku@no@- ‘put’.
The morpheme-class status of all of these elements is at best ambiguous,
but the issues are different in each case, hence my term of convenience “quasiverb.” I have previously used the term in connection with similar issues in
Songhay languages. Quotative wa, however, cannot directly take any verbal
inflectional material and is unambiguously a particle.","[403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408]"

ku$n-, which is limited to the unsuffixed Perfective and to its negation, is
irregularly related to the (mostly) regular transitive verb ku@no@- ‘put’. The latter
optionally reduces to H-toned ku@n- by Post-Sonorant Syncope in combinations
with coronal-initial suffix, hence Perfective ku@no@-ti $- varying with ku@n-ti -$ . The
transitive stem undergoes regular tone-dropping before negative AN suffixes,
one of which has coronal-initial suffix, hence Perfective Negative ku$no$-li@varying with ku$n-li@-. There is also another verb, ku@r<o@- ‘wear (garment)’ that
syncopates to ku@n-, and its syncopated forms are homophonous to those of
ku@no@-. In spite of the surface ku$n- in transitive ku$n-li@-, intransitive ku$n- ‘be
in’ is always easily identified, since it takes no AN suffixes except in a (stative)
Negative form ku$n-o@- with LH tone contour.
In relatives, the participles of intransitive ku$n- are Nonhuman ku^n-Ø (819),
human Sg ku@n-i n
$ (467.c) and human Pl ku@n-u$m (688).
Existential yE@ regularly precedes intransitive ku$n- in positive main clauses
in the absence of another focalized constituent. When the two are adjacent, the11.2 ‘Be’, ‘become’, and other statives421pronunciation is yç@ku$n-. Based on the vocalic assimilation (rounding), I treat
this combination as cliticized, cf. yç@kç$ and yç@wç$- with ‘be’ quasi-verbs.
ku$n- is usually translatable as ‘be in X’, ‘be put in X’, or ‘be included in X,
be a part of X’. It requires a locational complement in the X role. The usual
locational is a PP with bE@rE$ or bE$rE^˘ ‘in, inside’ (686.a-c), or sometimes with
the all-purpose postposition le$ in locative function (686.d). In free translation, it
is sometimes more idiomatic to rephrase ‘X be in Y’ as ‘Y have X in it’ or the
like (686.d).

"17.1 Quotative complement 589Quotations often include a vocative after this discourse marker. In indirect
discourse, the vocative takes the form of a third person human independent
pronoun, usually 3Sg wo@. Therefore even “indirect” quotations may begin with
what is literally ‘well, he/she!, …’, intended to suggest an original utterance like
‘well, Seydou, …‘ or ‘well, Mother, …’. I will use ‘hey!’ in the free translation,
however awkward it makes the English, to capture the presence of a vocative
without getting tangled in pronominal conversions that do not work well in
translation.
An alternative vocative substitute is ma^˘n (variant a$-ma^˘n) ‘So-and-so’,
which specifically replaces a (variable) personal name.
In addition, as is shown below, in jussives (embedded imperatives and
hortatives), even in otherwise clearly indirect discourse the verb has the same
modal category as in the original utterance. Therefore ‘He told them to come’
is expressed as ‘He said well, they!, come-Pl!’
An example of indirect discourse is (997). It occurs in the middle of a tale
that consists largely of quoted dialogue, so there is no need for an initial discourse particle to define the following as a quotation.

God (he) said, don’t he shoot Logo! (he) said.” The 3Sg pronouns systematically refer to the original addressee, logophorics refer to the original
speaker, and the original imperative negative verb form is retained without
change. Because of the importance of “direct” features in “indirect” discourse, I
often use “direct” quotations in the free English translations.
When the embedded addressee is nonhuman, it is expressed in indirect
discourse as a Nonhuman pronominal. (998) is from a tale where a girl speaks
to an unusually astute tree.

formulated with a plural pronominal (e.g. 1Pl or 2Pl), while the quoted
material proper replaces this with a corresponding singular. Example (999.c),
below, is of this type: ‘“Now I’ve seen that the millet stems have stopped
growing”, we’ll say.’ The outer 1Pl or 2Pl operates at the generalized level
subsuming multiple utterances, while the inner 1Sg or 2Sg is a representative
individual utterance.
17.1.2 ‘Say that …’ with inflectable ‘say’ verb (ga@˘-, jE$-)
A special feature of Jamsay discourse is the role of ‘say’ verb ga@˘- and quasiverb jE$- (see §11.3.1-2 for the forms). They occur not only in plainly quotative
contexts, but also in constructions that overlap functionally with temporal
adverbial clauses.
A simple quotative verb like ga@˘- or jE$- may be added to an otherwise
complete sentence, with no other overt indication of quotation status (999). In
imperfective and/or negative contexts, a form of ga@˘- is used (the unsuffixed
Imperfective is ga^- with short vowel). In perfective positive contexts, the only
pronominally inflectable ‘say’ (quasi-)verb is L-toned jE$- (unsuffixed
Perfective). The use of the unsuffixed Perfective suggests that the verb itself (or
at least its aspectual value) is defocalized.

This particle occurs with slight phonological variation in all languages of the
zone, and is even used in local French. It seems less common in Jamsay, where
it may be a fairly recent borrowing.
In (1175.a), the speaker responds with a trace of irritation to a vague
question about what kinds of song-and-dance festivities there are. In (1175.b),
the negation is emphatic.

This is the only occurrence of pE@y in my recorded texts, though I have
heard it in conversation. Elicitation brought out two other particles with similar
’(not) at all’ uses, fE@s and so@y. For so@y, whose more general sense is ‘all,
entirely’, see cf. §8.5.8.7.
fE@s is unusual in ending in a sibilant, a possibility restricted to interjections
(and poorly integrated borrowings). fE@s itself resembles ‘(not) at all’ particles in
some other languages of the region (e.g. Humburi Senni).","[700, 701]"
"2.1ProsodyPrevious published and unpublished descriptions of Dogon languages have
regularly commented that some form of lexical tone or accent is present, and
that it is subject to grammatical modification. However, no previous study has
actually analysed the prosodic system of a Dogon language.
In Jamsay, tone (lexical and grammatical) and intonation (including
grammaticalized intonation patterns) play a central role. Indeed, I know of no
(non-Dogon) language where prosody is so tightly integrated with the
morphosyntax. Working on Jamsay has deepened my conviction that currently
dominant grammatical theories, with their sharp compartmentalization of
“phonology” and “syntax,” are badly misguided.
The prosodic ingredients are given in (1). H[igh] and L[ow] are the
primitives of the tonal system. F[alling] and R[ising] are abbreviations for twopart contour tones <HL> and <LH>, respectively.
(1)a. lexical tones for stems

no mora can have more than one tone;

—(unsuffixed) Imperfective of verb (< floating L suffix)

—“tonal locative” of noun
c. grammatical tones (stem-wide)

—noun before modifying adjective or demonstrative
—NP-final word in NP that is head of relative clause
—initial in some nominal compound types
—verb before various suffixes (Negative, Verbal Noun)

—pronoun before some discourse-functional morphemes
—pronominal possessor before inalienable noun
—final in iterated verb
—verb stem in one type of purposive clause

—Imperative of most CvCv- and Cv˘- verbs
—final in some nominal (agentive) compound types

—predicate adjective in relative clause

—end of both conjuncts in NP conjunction
—end of word preceding universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’The contribution of tonal and intonational elements to Jamsay grammar is
therefore vast. Jamsay does with prosody much of what other languages do with
grammatical morphemes, or with morphosyntactic restructurings including
linear movement. Three examples: 1) most pronouns (excluding suffixes on
verbs) show no variation in segmental form across independent, subject, object,
and possessor categories, but use tones to make some distinctions (e.g. 3Pl be@
for independent, object, and alienable possessor, but be$ for subject and
inalienable possessor). 2) NP’s X and Y are normally conjoined in Jamsay
simply as [X Y], with no conjunction morpheme but with dying-quail final
intonation on both conjuncts. 3) the difference between main and relative
clauses is largely (though not entirely) expressed by tonal modifications. In
relatives, the (internal) head is not fronted. Instead, the final word of the head
NP drops its tones, a pronominal subject is expressed (in non-subject relatives)
by a preverbal L-toned pronominal, and Perfective verbs have the H(H…)L tone
overlay. There are also Participial suffixes, but since the form for Nonhuman
head is -Ø (zero), as is the 3Sg subject form in main clauses, the Participial
suffix cannot be relied on as an audible indicator of relative-clause status.
At the lexical level, tone is also important. Most native Jamsay words are
built up with Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with a smattering of CvC and a few Cv˘C
and extra-long Cv˘˘ syllables. Cv is monomoraic (=has one mora or syllabic
weight unit), Cv˘ and CvC are bimoraic, and Cv˘C and Cv˘˘ are trimoraic. Each
mora can have its own tonal primitive, H[igh] or L[ow], so a monomoraic
syllable can be only H or L, a bimoraic syllable can be H, L, F (= <HL>), or R
(= <LH>), and a trimoraic syllable can be any of the above or bell-shaped
<LHL>. There are some minimal pairs such as di@gE@ ‘bird’s leg’ versus d i $gE@
‘row’, ç$˘r<ç@ ‘monkey’ versus ç&˘r<ç$ ‘waterskin’, and ci@rE@ ‘horn’ versus ci$rE@
‘hard wood’. Many word families include a noun and a related verb that differ
in tone. For example, the HH-toned noun bi@rE@ ‘work’ is associated with the
LH-toned verb bi r$ E@- ‘work’, and the two regularly combine in the VP bi@rE@
bi r$ E@- ‘work, do some work’.","[29, 30, 31]"
"16.4 ‘Unless’ antecedent (y$ la$˘ de$y)58316.3 Willy-nilly and disjunctive antecedents (‘whether X or Y … ’)
Willy-nilly antecedents are expressed by juxtaposing the positive and negative
versions of the pseudo-antecedent, with a final cE^w or fu@˘ ‘all’ (984).

In (986), fu@˘ ‘all’ at the end of a manner adverbial implies an unexpressed
disjunctive antecedent (‘regardless of whether …’). The context involves
someone who flees the area to avoid paying an indemnity and comes back only
years later.

19.2.1 ‘Well, …’ (ha@yE$)
ha@yE$ is a common presentential particle, borrowed from Fulfulde. It is used like
English ‘well, …’. That is, it often suggests a mildly adversarial element in a
conversation. However, it is often used (with no adversarial sense) at the
beginning of a quotation. It often seems to be included to signal that a quotation
is at hand, there being no other indicator at the beginning of a quotation.

19.2.2 ‘Well, in that case…’ (wa@la^˘)
Pronounced wa@la^˘, French voilà ‘there it is’ occurs in texts in situations similar
to those of ha@yE$. However, wa@la^˘, more than ha@yE$, is a response to something
just said (cf. English there you are! as a confirmation). I find a free translation
‘well, in that case …’ appropriate, as in (1156).

2004.3.20
19.2.3 ‘But …’ (ka$˘, ka@˘, ga$˘)
Clause-initial ka$˘ (most common variant), ga$˘, or ka@˘ has the adversative sense
‘but’. This is a regional form, occuring with slight phonological variations in the
languages of the zone, including Fulfulde and Songhay. I am unable to
confidently establish a lexical tone. In isolation, my assistant pronounces ka@˘
with fairly high pitch, but most textual occurrences have L-toned ka$˘ or variant670Grammatical pragmaticsga$˘. It may be that ka$˘ is correct phonological transcription while the highpitched version is intonation, i.e. ka$˘.

French mais (often heard with low tone) is increasingly used among young
people, as in all languages of this area.
19.2.4 ‘So, …’ (bE$y, hç@nç$)
Another clause-initial discourse particle is bE$y. It is best translated as sentenceinitial ‘So now, …’. It occurs in the middle of conversations as a presentential
particle, set off with an intonation break. It occurs, for example, when the
speaker is ready to ask a follow-up question of the interlocutor, developing the
preceding discourse. The particle does not mean ‘so’ in the causal sense.

Jamsay. It can be glossed ‘so’ in a more literally causal sense.

Preclausal topical phrases based on Nonhuman ko@ (here with discoursedeictic reference) are also common (§4.3.2). The phrase [ko@ ku$<] ‘that
(discourse-definite)’ is often used to preface new material that is somehow
contextualized by the preceding material. It may be loosely translated as ‘so, …’
or ‘that being the case, …’, but with no strong causal connotations. Like English
so, [ko@ ku$] is often used at the beginning of a question in the middle of an
interview; examples are in (1202) and (1205).
19.2.5 ‘Indeed’ (ha$˘si@n)
This particle, of rather low text-frequency, is clause-initial. I gloss it ‘indeed’ or
‘in fact’. In addition to the examples in (1160), see (197.b). In (1160.a), the
village elders announce their findings in a hypothetical case where a cow
damaged a farmer’s field.

19.2.6 ‘Lo, …’ (ja$ka@, ja@ka$-ja@ka$)
Presentential marker ja$ka@ or iterated ja@ka$-ja@ka$, borrowed from Fulfulde
jaka, occurs before clauses in narrative that contain a surprise or other strongly
highlighted material. In my texts, it occurs only in lively tales and anecdotes.

19.3.1 ‘Firstly’ (ti@) and ‘to conclude’ (du$mno@)

An alternative expression meaning ‘for one thing’ is dç^m ke@, a topicalized
form of dç^m ‘(up to) now’.
For sequential adverbial ‘first’ (as in ‘think first, then act’), see la@˘ in
(474.b).
‘To conclude’ may be expressed by ko@ du$mno@, literally ‘its ending’.
19.3.2 ‘(Not) again’, ‘on the other hand’ (la$ƒa@)
la$ƒa@, also a simple adjective meaning ‘other’, is used adverbially in a range of
functions. It is fairly common in negative sentences in the sense ‘(not) again’,
‘(not) any more’ (1163).

phrases with a verb like ga$ra@- ‘pass, go past’ (§19.3.4, below).
la$ƒa@ is also used to mark a major shift in topics (‘elsewhere, …’ or
‘meanwhile, …’). In (1164), it marks an interruption in a narrative sequence,
where the narrator moves back in time. The speaker has been describing how he
and a companion had traveled from Dogon country to Gao (in northern Mali).

A clause-final morpheme na$˘ may occur at the end of a clause immediately

In each textual example there is some kind of adversarial relationship
between the two clauses, so a gloss ‘though, however’ is often appropriate. For
example, my assistant commented that textual example (1101.a) could also be
phrased with na$˘ as (1101.b). The adversarial relationship that is merely implied
by juxtaposing positive and negative clauses in (1101.a) is made more explicit
by adding na$˘. A similar reading is possible in (1102), though the logical

reflexive, topic-indexing, logophoric, and reciprocal.
The forms i $ni w
$ <e@ (e.g. reflexive object) and E$nE@ (e.g. reflexive possessor,
logophoric) may be related to each other and to the noun i@ne@- ‘person’ (e.g. Sg
i@ne@-n). E$nE@ has a dialectal variant i n
$ e@-. Both i n
$ i $w<e@ and E$nE@ are morphologically nouns rather than pronouns. They may be followed by regular
nominal postpositions, but do not have special dative clitic forms like those of
true personal pronouns, E$nE@ (but not i n
$ i $w<e@) may be pluralized by adding
particle be@.
18.1 Reflexive
18.1.1 Reflexive non-subject arguments (i $ni w
$ <e@)
Reflexive i n
$ i $w<e@ is an anaphor that is coindexed with the clause-mate subject.
It may function as a direct object or postpositional complement. Further detail
on the syntax is given in §18.4, below.
Reflexive object is expressed by the invariant noun i n
$ i $w<e@, which does not
agree with the subject in person, humanness, or plurality (1104).

A following verb may also occur in the unmarked Perfective. This
defocalization of the verb suggests that the Reflexive pronoun is (covertly)
focalized. Therefore (1105.a), below, is available as an alternative to (1104.a),
above. (1105.b) shows that overt focalization with y$ clitic is also possible.","[661, 662, 663, 664]"
"16.7 Counterfactual conditional
Counterfactuals are characterized by the use of the Past particle ji ˘$ < (§10.3.1) in
both antecedent and consequent clauses. Occasionally ji ˘$ < is omitted in the
antecedent (990.d). The antecedent ends in the usual ‘if’ particle dey, which
follows ji ˘$ <. A verb in a positive antecedent typically has Resultative -sa$(990.a-b). A quasi-verb (wç$- ‘be’, sa$- ‘have’) or defective stance verb appears
in its usual L-toned unsuffixed Perfective form (990.c-d). A regular verb in the
consequent most often appears in the unsuffixed Imperfective form.

17.1.1 Direct versus indirect in quotative complements
Jamsay quotative complements have a mix of “direct” and “indirect” discourse
features. A distinction between direct and indirect discourse can be made on the
basis of deictics, particularly first and second person pronouns. In completely
direct discourse, the original deictics (including pronominals) are preserved. In
indirect discourse there is a new deictic center (usually including a new
speaker and listener), so pronouns and other deictics must be shifted. The
regular conversions are those in (992).

(referring to the quoted speaker), third person pronominals are regularly used
to refer to the original addressee(s). The conversions in (992) assume that the
original speaker and the original addressee(s) are distinct from the current
speaker and addressee. Thus the original threatening speech event (993.a) could
be reported, by a third party to a fourth party, as (993.b).

for a reflexive, as does a true 3rd person; see §18.4.6.
However, it sometimes happens that an original-speech-event speaker
and/or addressee is also a participant in the current speech act. In this case,
the current speech-act participant status trumps the indirect conversions in
(992), as in English, where a directly quoted I will kill you, with speech-act
roles reversed in the current speech event, becomes indirectly quoted (you said
that) you would kill me.
An example of this trumping is (994), from a text describing how disputes
are resolved. The speaker uses ‘you-Pl’ generically to denote the disputants. In
the (indirect) quotation, the disputants are also the original addressees (i.e., are
embedded second persons). The original 1Sg shifts to Logophoric as usual.
However, the expected shift of embedded 2Pl to 3Pl pronoun be@ does not occur,
since their status as current speech-event addressees locks the referents into
second person status.

"2.2Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbsMost if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.
However, the verb can be followed by clause-linking subordinators and certain
discourse particles like ‘only’ with clausal scope. In addition, some normally
preverbal constituents, especially adverbial phrases, are occasionally added (as
afterthoughts or clarifications) after the verb, with an intervening pause.
Verb stems must respect well-defined restrictions on segmental form and
lexical tones. Regular verbs end in a long vowel if monosyllabic, in a short
vowel if longer. The stem-level lexical tone pattern of a verb can only be all-H
or L(L…)H with H on the final mora.
In non-imperative, non-focalized main clauses, the verb has the basic
structure (2), omitting some details.
(2)[stem - (derivational suffix)] - aspect/negation - pronominal subjectBeginning with the final element, verbs are inflected for subject person and
number category (1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman, 3Pl); see §10.2. The
3Sg/Nonhuman suffix is -Ø. The pronominal subject suffix may be the only
expression of the subject, or it may agree with an unfocalized preverbal NP. In
the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive), Nonhuman subject is distinguished from
(human) 3Sg subject by adding quasi-verb kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ after the
regular verb stem.",[32]

[Rdp + final L-tone] reduplicated Imperfective
In the perfective system, the unsuffixed Perfective is the basic form used in
the presence of a focalized constituent, and in relative clauses. In other
(positive) clauses, there is a choice between the Perfective (-ti$-, -yE$-/-ya$-, or
-a^˘-) and the other more specialized categories listed. In the imperfective
system, the unsuffixed Imperfective is the most common form, but it gets some
competition from suffixally marked categories. There is a relatively lowfrequency reduplicated option in both perfective and imperfective systems.
The importance of tones in distinguishing inflectional categories, and in
distinguishing main from relative clauses, can be brought out by considering the
verb ‘fight’ (5).

jE$yE^˘(</jE$yE@-L/)jE@yE@The lexical form jE$yE@ with {LH} (i.e. rising) contour occurs as the bare
stem in verb chains, and before non-Negative AN suffixes. The unsuffixed
Perfective undergoes tone-dropping to all-L jE$yE$- in main clauses (after a
focalized constituent), but has the H(H…)L overlay in relative clauses, where it
appears as HL-toned jE@yE$-. The unsuffixed Imperfective is underlying /jE$yE@- L/,
as a final floating L-tone follows the stem; if there is no audible pronominal2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs13suffix, the L-tone is grafted onto the preceding H-toned vowel. If short, this
vowel (now <HL>-toned) is lengthened to two moras to allow the contour tone
to be expressed. Finally, the Imperative is all-H-toned jE@yE@. In other words, this
CvCv- stem can appear with LH, LL, HL, LF, and HH tones. These tonal
distinctions, while occasionally redundant (LL before Negative suffix), are in
several cases the sole expression of the relevant morphosyntactic category.
In negative indicative clauses, though some suffixally marked aspects can
occur, aspect tends to be reduced to a simple perfective-imperfective opposition,
expressed by the portmanteau suffixes -li@- (Perfective Negative) and -go@(Imperfective Negative); see (3.c-d), above, and §10.1.3. There is a distinct,
aspectually undifferentiated Negative suffix -la@- for adjectives and some stative
verbs and quasi-verbs (§11.4.3), and similar but L-toned Negative morphemes
(la$˘, la$) are used in a few minor constructions (§11.2.1.3-4).
Imperative verbs (§10.4) have a distinct set of inflections for subject (2Sg
[=zero], 2Pl), and special negative (i.e. prohibitive) forms, as seen in (6) with
verb yE$rE@ ‘come’.

ImprtNeg.PlThere is a Hortative with suffix -m@ (10.4.3).
There are also a handful of aspectually defective quasi-verbs meaning
‘say’, ‘be’, ‘have’, and ‘be in’ with Cv- and CvC- shapes, which are not
otherwise allowable for Jamsay verb stems. The morphosyntax of the various
elements is variable, and “quasi-verb” is an intentionally vague cover term. In
most cases they occur with L-tone in main clauses and with H(H…)L tone in
relative clauses, which aligns them formally with the unsuffixed Perfective of
regular verbs. Some of the quasi-verbs are segmentally identical to AN suffixes,
suggesting the possibility that the quasi-verb is really just an AN suffix added to
a phonologically empty verb slot. See §11.2.2-3, §11.5.1 for the full coverage.
There are also some stative stance and ‘hold’ verbs that are aspectually
defective, occurring in perfective forms only (§11.2.4, §11.5.2).","[33, 34, 35]"
"10.2.2 Nonhuman versus 3Sg subject
Cliticized quasi-verb kç$ ‘be.Nonh’ is added to the unsuffixed Imperfective to
index a Nonhuman subject. The L-tone segment that marks Imperfective,
underlyingly located between the stem proper and the kç$, is realized on the
kç$ (i.e. it merges with the already low tone of the clitic). Thus mi@ cE@rE@kç$ ‘it
will bite me’ from /cE@rE@-Lkç$/, see Tone-Grafting (131).
kç$ is syntactically and morphologically verblike rather than a typical
pronominal suffix. Whereas the human subject pronominal suffixes are replaced
by preverbal subject pronominals in relative clauses, kç$ remains in postverbal
position in relatives, and Participial suffixes are added to it rather than to the
preceding verb (§14.1.9).
kç$ is absent after verbs in AN categories (including Imperfective
Negative) other than the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive). In the other AN
categories, Nonhuman subject is with 3Sg subject as zero: Perfective (ya&˘-yE$-Ø
‘He/She/It went’, mi@ cE@t-ti $-Ø ‘He/She/It bit me’), Resultative -sa$- (mi@ E@˘-sa$-Ø
‘He/She/It saw me’), -jE$- (n)E˘@ -jE$-Ø ‘He/She/It already ate’), -tE@rE$- (mi@
cE@t-tE@rE$-Ø ‘He/She/It once bit me’), Perfective negative (mi@ cE$l-li@-Ø
‘He/She/It didn’t bite me’), Imperfective Negative (mi@ cE$rE$-go@-Ø ‘He/She/It
won’t bite me’), Habitual (mi@ cE$r-a@˘ra$-Ø ‘He/She/It bites me’), or marked
Imperfective (mi@ cE@t-tç@ƒç$-Ø ‘He/She/It bites me’). In interlinears, I gloss the
zero suffix as “3SgS,” though “3SgS/Nonh” would be more accurate.
Occasionally there is an preverbal 3rd person or Nonhuman pronoun,
apparently in subject function. In the type exemplified by (589.a), the verb
na@˘-y<E$-Ø might easily be taken as ending in 3Sg subject -Ø, which makes one
wonder why there is also a preverbal L-toned subject pronominal wo$. This is
actually a participial construction, with Nonhuman Participial -Ø indexing an
unexpressed nonhuman head (with a meaning like ‘time’ or ‘situation’).
Therefore it is appropriate for the (non-head) subject to be expressed by an
L-toned pronominal; see (974) and discussion there. In the common expression
(589.b), kç$˘-rç@ ‘it is not (present)’ is already marked for nonhuman subject, so
the preceding H-toned ko@ is redundant. One could argue that the ko@ is topical.",[394]
"11.2.2 Existential and locative quasi-verbs and particles
11.2.2.1 Existential particle (yE@)
This is not an inflectable verb, rather a particle (or arguably an obligatorily
chained quasi-verb) that precedes a few (quasi-)verbs expressing existence/
location or possession.
The Existential particle is obligatory in positive, unfocalized main clauses
predicating existence or possession. It is not used in negative counterparts of
these clauses, and it is not used when a nonpredicative constituent is focalized.
The relevant positive combinations are the possessives yE@ sa$- ‘have’ (§11.5.1),
yE@ ji n
$ e$- ‘have possession of’ (§11.5.2), yç@ku$n- ‘be in’ (§11.2.3), and the

‘(While he was working in the field,) A Fulbe herder came there
and encountered him.’ 2004.4.4Narratives that recount complex episodes from the past are replete with
such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).
(551)a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
other constituent is focalized);
b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and therefore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
low information value of the verb’s own content is also a contributing factor;10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs347c. semantically “light” perfective quotative verb (‘said’) after
quotation.
The all-L tone pattern and the lack of overt AN suffixation can, in this light,
be considered to be iconic.
The expanded use of the unsuffixed Perfective, albeit with a different tone
pattern, in relative clauses might be interpreted as reflecting an overall reduction
in focal salience of the verb and other constituents in relative clauses.
There are analogues to the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective with predicative
adjectives and with negative verbs. When a predicative adjective is defocalized,
it not only drops its tones, but also omits the otherwise usual cliticized ‘be’
quasi-verb (§11.4.2). With negative verbs, the regular form (not defocalized)
has L-toned verb stem plus H-toned suffix (Perfective Negative -li@-, Imperfective Negative -go@-). Therefore the only audible cue to defocalization is that
the tone on the suffix drops to L-tone, as seen in (748) in §13.1.2 and (751) in
§13.1.3. There is no overt defocalization for positive imperfective verbs.
10.1.2.3 Marked Perfective (-ti $-, -yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-)
The suffixal (=marked) Perfective is used in positive main clauses where the
verb is not defocalized. The suffixed Perfective is almost always replaced by the
unsuffixed Perfective in relative clauses and related subordinated clauses.
There are two basic morphological types of Perfective (positive), one with
-ti -$ and one with -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-. The first is always a classic perfective, while
the second can be interpreted either as perfective in the same classic sense, or as
a resultative-stative.
The choice between the two major Perfective types depends chiefly on the
transitivity and (especially among intransitives) on the semantic type of the
verb. The division is summarized in (552). For perception verbs, which do not
readily co-occur with either Perfective suffix allomorph, see §10.1.2.4.
(552)-ti -$most transitives
active intransitives-yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-a few weak transitives (‘resemble’, ‘forget’)
(basically intransitive) motion verbs
(basically intransitive) stance verbs
intransitive (inchoative) adjectival verbs
other intransitive stative verbs348Verbal inflectionExamples of verbs taking -ti $- are: a) classic transitives cE@jE@- ‘cut’
(cE@jE@-ti -$ ), de$ne@- ‘want, love’ (de$ne@-ti -$ ), pa@ƒa@- ‘tie’ (pa@ƒa@-ti $-); and b) active
intransitives plus weak transitives that regularly take fixed “objects” such as
cognate nominals (gç@lç@rç@) dç$n)ç@- ‘snore’ (dç$n)ç@-ti -$ ), (ni@˘) i n
$ e@- ‘bathe’
(i n
$ e@-ti-), mç$w<ç@- ‘laugh’ (mç$w<ç@-ti -$ ), te@ge@- ‘speak’ (te@ge@-ti $), yi n
$ e@‘breathe’ (yi n
$ e@-ti -$ ), and pe@re@- ‘jump’ (pe@t-ti -$ , but with variant pe@y-ya$-).
I have no clear idea as to the origin of -ti -$ . It most likely has a common
history with ti@ as a linker (indicating a sequential chronological relationship)
among chained verbs (§15.1.16). There is some possibility of a more distant
connection with the transitive verb ti@˘- ‘send’.
The choice between -yE$-/-ya$- on the one hand and -a^˘- on the other is based
on the phonological form of the verb, as summarized in (553). Variation
between -yE$- and -ya$- is free; both occurred in my tapes in the speech of
individual informants, and it was often difficult to distinguish them.
(553)a. -yE$-/-ya$monosyllabic Cv˘syncopating bisyllabic (C)vrv-, (C)vr<v- (before phonological
contractions)
b. -a^˘nonsyncopating bisyllabic stems
trisyllabic and longer stemsThe allomorph -yE$-/-ya$- perhaps derives historically from ya&˘- ‘go’. Indeed,
many of the verbs taking -yE$-/-ya$- are motion verbs. It seems unlikely that
allomorph -a^˘- is historically related to the phonologically similar verb a@˘‘catch’, but -a^˘- might have some historical connection to (the onset of) the
Habitual suffix -a@˘ra$- in the imperfective system.
Monosyllabic stems with -yE$-/-ya$- include dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’ (dç@˘-ya$-),
go@˘- ‘go out’ (go@˘-ya$-), be@˘- ‘stay, live’ (be@˘-ya$-), ni@˘- ‘sleep’ (ni@˘-y<a$-), na@˘‘pass the night’ (na@˘-y<a$-), and ya&˘- ‘go’ (ya&˘-ya$-).
Syncopating bisyllabic stems (those of shape Cvrv- or Cvr<v- ) that take
-yE$-/-ya$- include yE$rE@- ‘come’ (ye&y-ya$-), ga$ra@- ‘pass by’ (ga&y-ya$-), lo@ro@- ‘get
pregnant’ (lo@y-ya$-), ba$r<a@- ‘become red’ (ba&y<-ya$-), mç$r<ç@- ‘come together’
(mç&y<-y<a$-), and u$rç@- ‘go up’ (u&y-ya$-). On Post-Sonorant Syncope (60), which
(with two exceptions not relevant to this section) applies only to CvCv- stems
with short vowels and with medial rhotic r or r<, see §3.5.3.2.
Nonsyncopating bisyllabics with -a^˘- include na@Na@- ‘forget’ (na@N-a^˘-),
ti@me@- ‘resemble’ (ti@m-a^˘-), nu$mo@- ‘fall’ (nu$m-a^˘-), su$go@- (su$g-a^˘-), di N
$ e@- ‘sit

$ -a^˘-), i $ne) @- ‘lie down’ (i $n)-a^˘-), nu@w<o@- ‘die’ (nu@w<-a^˘-), u@˘r<o@- ‘get10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs349up’ (u@˘r<-a^˘), jç$wç@- ‘run’ (jç$w-a^˘-), i@jE@- ‘stand’ (i@j-a^˘-), and do$n)o-@ ‘stumble’
(do$n)-a^˘-).
Trisyllabic examples are ko@mo@n)o@- ‘became wrinkled’ (ko@mo@n-) a^˘-),
na@Na@-r<a@- ‘remember’ = reversive of ‘forget’ (na@Na@-r<-a^˘-), and ba$na$-r<a@‘become red’ (ba$na$-r<a^˘-).
The rare combination of-yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘- with a syntactically transitive verb
is illustrated in (554). The few verbs in question are the very epitomes of wimpy
transitivity.

themselves to either the (classic) perfective or the stative-resultative reading.
Thus ni@˘-y<a$-Ø can mean ‘he/she went to sleep’ (perfective, event completed
before time of reference), or ‘he/she is sleeping’ (stative-resultative, state
continuing into the present). Motion verbs favor the straight perfective reading,
though of course a completed motion event also creates a state. Thus go@˘-ya$-Ø
‘he/she went out’, contextually also ‘… has gone out’ = ‘… is out, is not here’.
Adjectival stative verbs also favor the perfective (in this case inchoative)
reading, e.g. ‘became red’, but for a different reason, viz., the adjective itself is
used predicatively to denote a timeless state: predicate adjective ba@nkç$ ‘it is
red’, intransitive perfective ba$na$-r<-a^˘-Ø ‘it became red’ or ‘… has become
red’.
The fact that the Perfective suffixes can differentiate transitive and
(intransitive) stative verbs makes it easier to understand why Jamsay has so
many ambi-valent stems that can be transitive or intransitive. For example,
do@mno@- ‘finish’ has two Perfective forms, each associated with a particular
valency: do@mno@-ti -$ in transitive function (‘X finished Y’), but do@mn-a^˘- in
intransitive function (‘Y came to an end’). Likewise, with an inchoativefactitive pair of deadjectival verbs, du$gu$-no@-ti -$ must be interpreted as transitive factitive ‘X fattened Y’, while du$gu$-n-a^˘- can only be intransitive
inchoative ‘Y became fat’.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371]"

Examples (1056.b,d) and (1057.b) show that negation is expressed on the

(since there is no negative counterpart of the Verbal Noun).

"3.7.2Grammatical tone patternsGrammatically controlled modifications of lexical tones are of two kinds: ToneGrafting (to the end of the stem), see (116), (118), and (131) below, and stemwide tone overlays. Grafting does not erase lexical tones, while overlays do.
There are many overlaid tone contours in Jamsay morphosyntax, while grafting
is limited to the tonal locative of nouns (§8.1) and to the unsuffixed Imperfective of verbs (§10.1.2.8).
Overlays themselves are of two kinds. In one, the overlay on the stem is
automatically triggered by a following suffix. In the other, the overlay is
controlled syntactically, though of course this too represents a kind of
dependence on the presence of other elements.
The beauty of the lexical tones, with at least one H-tone element in every
regular noun, verb, adjective, and numeral stem (§3.7.1), is that one can always
audibly express a morphosyntactic category by converting all tones in the stem
to L (tone-dropping). This happens systematically with nouns (before a modifying adjective or demonstrative, as head of relative clause, and as initial in
some compound types), adjectives and numerals (as final word in an NP that
heads a relative clause), pronouns (preverbal subject function, possessor with
inalienable kin terms, preceding some particles like Topic ke@), and verbs
(before Negative suffix, unsuffixed Perfective after focalized constituent).
There are other tone overlays, the most common being H(H…)L, which
occurs in the unsuffixed Perfective of verbs when used in relative clauses, in the
final of some nominal compounds, and in possessed forms of inalienable nouns.
There is an all-H overlay in imperatives of most CvCv- and Cv˘- verbs, and in
the final of some compounds.
It is no exaggeration to say that grammatical tone changes (along with
grammaticalized intonation) are the central motor of Jamsay morphosyntax.
Below is a brief summary of the grammatical tone processes applicable to
verbs, nouns, and other word-classes. It is followed by formulations of the
relevant grammatical tone processes. The section on tonology will conclude
with discussion of a number of low-level tone rules.",[125]

10.4.1 Imperatives and Prohibitives
The forms of the Imperative (Imprt) depend on polarity and on addressee
number. The positive Imperatives are based on the Imperative (Imprt) stem. For
nearly all monosyllabic (C)v˘- and short-voweled (C)vCv- bisyllabic stems, the
Imperative is an all-H-toned stem (C)v@˘- or (C)v@Cv@-, the shift being audible in
the case of R-toned (C)v&˘- and LH-toned (C)v$Cv@- stems (see below for a few
exceptions where the shift to all-H does not occur). Other stems, including
bisyllabic long-voweled (C)v˘Cv- stems, and all stems of three or more syllables, use their lexical form as the Imperative.
The Imperative stem always ends in an H-tone. The subject suffix is zero
for singular, L-toned -y$ for plural addressee. The negative imperative (i.e.,
Prohibitive) is characterized by a suffix -y@ added to an L-toned form of the
verb stem; la^y is added if the addressee is plural.
(599)addresseepositive imperative negative (prohibitive)Sg
PlImprt stem
L-toned stem plus-y@
Imprt stem plus -y$ L-toned stem plus -y@ la^yThere is some potential for homophony between the singular Prohibitive in
-y@ and the 1Pl unsuffixed Perfective in -y. Both follow all-L-toned stems. The
1Pl suffix is usually L-toned after an unsuffixed Perfective, in which case there
is no homophony. However, in an all-L-toned word, a nonzero pronominalsubject suffix is sometimes realized with a H-tone, especially in isolation or
before a clause-final particle. For example, go$˘-y@ ‘don’t go out!’ is audibly
distinct from go$˘-y ‘we went out’ in the usual case where the latter is clause-10.4 Imperatives and hortatives379final and preceded by other material. However, in the contexts mentioned
above, ‘we went out’ may also be heard as go$˘-y@.
For monosyllabic (C)v˘- stems, homophony between the singular
Prohibitive in -y@ and the Verbal Noun (allomorph -y@ after monosyllabic stem)
also threatens. However, it is avoided in that the stem vowel is shortened in the
Verbal Noun but not in the plural Imperative: go$˘-y@ ‘don’t go out!’, but go$-y@
‘going out (VblN)’.
The Imperative and Prohibitive forms for ‘come’ are given in (600). Note
the H-tone Imperative stem yE@rE@-, compare the LH tone of the lexical stem
yE$rE@-. Note also how the tones distinguish yE$rE$-y@ (600.b) from yE@rE@-y$ (600.c).

the lexical LLH tone, since the shift from LH (or R) basic form to all-H

stems.

As noted before, most monosyllabic Cv˘-, and short-voweled bisyllabic
(C)vCv- stems require all-H tone in the Imperative stem. Regular examples:
monosyllabic ja&˘<- ‘dig’, Imperative ja@˘< ; bisyllabic di g
$ E@- ‘follow’, Imperative
di@gE@ (note the tone shifts).
A few R-toned monosyllabic or LH-toned short-voweled bisyllabic stems
irregularly preserve their lexical tones in the Imperative stem. Those known to
me are ya&˘- ‘go’, di N
$ e@- ‘sit down’, i n
$ e) @ ‘lie down, go to bed’, and ya$Na@- ‘look;
pick up’. The Imperatives are ya&˘ ‘go!’, di N
$ e@ ‘sit down!’, i$n)e@ ‘go to bed!’, and
ya$Na@ ‘look!’
For wç&˘- ‘kill’, I recorded a special positive Imperative form wç&˘ ti@-, hence
singular Imperative wç&˘ ti@ ‘kill!’ with plural /wç&˘ ti@-y$/ (= wç&˘ ti^˘-Ø). Here wç&˘
appears to be the bare stem, followed (in a verb-chain construction) by ti@- as the
inflectable stem. This ti@ may be related to the Linker ti@ that occurs in some
verb-chains with chronological-sequencing sense (§15.1.16), but the precise
relationship is unclear. The corresponding Prohibitives of ‘kill’ are regular and
omit ti@-, hence singular wç$˘-y@ ‘don’t-Sg kill!’, plural wç$˘-y@ la^y ‘don’t-Pl kill!’.","[399, 400, 401, 402]"

‘(a place) where they (had) hid you-Sg’j i $˘<PastThere is another construction with what appears to be the same morpheme,
this time in the form j i& ˘$<-. The preceding verb takes its regular lexical tone and
is uninflectable, showing that a verb-chain is at hand. j i& ˘$<- itself is morphologically an unsuffixed Imperfective, implying an R-toned lexical form /j i&˘</
onto which the extra L-tone of the unsuffixed Perfective is grafted to produce a
bell-shaped <LHL> tone when the following pronominal or Participial suffix is
zero. When the suffix is nonzero, the floating L-tone appears on the suffixal
mora, by regular phonological rules; see Tone-Grafting (131), Contour-Tone
Stretching (143), Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). That ji&˘$<- is an
unsuffixed Imperfective is demonstrated by the fact that a Nonhuman subject
requires a following cliticized ‘be’ quasi-verb kç$, a unique feature of this AN
category. Other subject categories have their usual suffixal forms. The sense of
this construction is ‘(does/will do) in the meantime’ (i.e. while waiting for an
expected subsequent event)’. The time reference is to the present or future
(with respect to the deictic center).

"14.3.2‘what they call “X”’The verb ga@˘- ‘say’ may be used in a special type of object relative. This
construction is very common in interview-style texts where an expert speaker is
explaining e.g. agricultural techniques, and periodically introduces technical or
archaic vocabulary. Jamsay ‘what they call “X”’ can be freely glossed as ‘socalled X’. The subject is 3Pl (nonspecific referentially), the verb is a participle
based on Perfective ga^- with H(H…)L contour, and Definite ku$< is regularly
added. With zero suffix, ga^- is lengthened by ga^˘-Ø by Contour-Tone MoraAddition (141). The quoted term has its normal tones, and is therefore not the
head NP. Therefore, when no obvious object NP is present, as in (853.a), a zero
object functioning as relative head is posited. In (853.b), an object NP ‘women’
(the third word in the example) is an overt direct-object head. The quoted term
is therefore an adjunct and is neither relative head nor direct object.

‘While he (=Hyena) was looking (on the ground), Hyena [topic],
Camel was watching him (from up above).’ 2004.4.310.1.2.12 Stative -i^˘
A Stative suffix -i^˘ is attested with verbs of opening and shutting (pi@ne@- ‘shut’
and le@˘- ‘shut [door]’), along with their reversive derivatives (the regular
pi@ni@-r<e@- ‘open’ and the irregular li@l-le@- ‘open’). The form with -i^˘ has an
intransitive stative-resultative sense ‘be open’ or ‘be shut’, with a third person
subject denoting ‘doorway’ or the like. For bisyllabic or longer verbs, the stemfinal vowel contracts with the suffixal vowel, and the remainder of the stem
drops its tones, so we get Cv$(C)(Cv$)C-i^˘ with a L…<HL> contour, as in pi n
$ -i^˘
‘be shut’, pi n
$ i $-r<-i^˘ ‘be open’, and li $ll-i^˘ ‘be open’. With a Cv˘ monosyllabic
verb, we get Cv$y@y$ (arguably Cv$i ^˘ but in one syllable) with the same contour
compressed into a single <LHL> syllable, hence le$-y@y$ ‘be shut, (garment) be
tied on’.
This Stative category stands outside of the regular perfective and imperfective systems. Verbs with this suffix behave like defective stative verbs, and
are negated by adding the Negative particle la$˘- (3Pl la$˘-ba$) to the positive
stem. Cf. Negative la$˘ after the ‘it is’ clitic, hence y$ la$˘ ‘not be’ (§11.2.1.3),
and the more versatile (stative) Negative la$ with short vowel (§11.2.1.4).

Given its negative morphosyntax and its tone contour, it is likely that
Stative -i^˘ originated as a special case of the ‘it is’ clitic (allomorphs y$ and
i $˘), added to the Verbal Noun (§4.2.2.1, e.g. pi n

"15.3 Constructions with superfluous ma$573Some of these features suggest affinities with Verbal Noun complements
(§17.4.1) and ‘before …’ clauses (§15.2.4.2).
A free translation with ‘suddenly’ or the like captures the narrative flavor.
When two such clauses are paired, a rapid-fire chronological sequence is
suggested, as in line 4 of (963). The contextual translation is ‘no sooner did …
than …’.

After a second clause (‘was holding’) whose form is not relevant here, the

where ma$ occurs in its normal function within a possessed NP, the third clause
may be schematically modeled as [he ma$ top ma$ stick ma$ brought down], i.e.
‘he (suddenly) brought down the stick on the top’. When one does include the574Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clausestrue possessive occurrence, we get an even more incantatory sequence [he ma$

in favor of inserting ma$ before the verb here.

The unmarked simple conditional clause is of the form [S1 dey, S2]. In this
construction, S1 denotes an eventuality that has occurred, does occur, or may
occur. The pitch of dey is variable. When clause-final, it behaves as an atonal
morpheme, which then copies the final tone of the preceding word, see AtonalMorpheme Tone-Spreading (137). Because of the way H- and L-tones pattern
with AN suffixes, in practice we get de@y after negative verbs (if not
defocalized) and after lexical-stem pseudo-participles, but de$y in the more
common combination with a preceding positive verb.
When non-clause-final (i.e. when followed by another particle), the basic
form is H-toned de@y. In some high-frequency combinations this simplifies to de@
(§16.1.3).
Both antecedent and consequent clauses have main-clause form in the
great majority of cases, so their verbs have pronominal suffixes as appropriate.
dey occurs at the end of the antecedent clause, which normally precedes the
consequent, though occasional textual examples of postposed antecedent
clauses (probably afterthoughts) have turned up. The construction is very
common, and one can often translate dey as ‘when …’ instead of as ‘if’. In
other words, [S1 dey, S2] may simply indicate chronological ordering, as in the
description of a complex activity involving multiple sequential actions, so long
as there is some connection between these actions (a necessary sequencing, for
example). The [S1 dey, S2] construction therefore competes with the explicitly
temporal [[S1 (ga@˘) ka^n], S2] construction (§15.2.2.1).
16.1.1 Regular antecedent clause with pronominal subject suffix
The unmarked AN category for the antecedent is a perfective-system verb. The
Resultative suffix -sa$- is very common with active (non-stative) verbs, though
all other perfective-system suffixes (including Perfective -ti -$ and Recent
Perfect -jE$-) and the unsuffixed Perfective are possible. A pronominal subject is
usually expressed as a pronominal subject suffix on the verb (see the
immediately following section for a distinct pattern with preverbal subject
pronominals).","[594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"
"476Focalization and interrogation13.2.4 Embedded interrogatives
In this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in
(795).

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).

know-ImpfNeg-1SgS
‘I don’t know how much they paid.’This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.","[497, 498, 499]"
"11.5 Possessive predicates437The first is that, in the sense ‘have’, the only stem used in positive clauses is
L-toned unsuffixed Perfective ji $ne$-, even with present time reference.
The second is that ji $ne$- (like sa$-) is preceded by Existential yE@ (§11.2.2.1)
in positive possessive predications, if there is no (other) explicitly focalized
constituent. A chained verb may intervene between yE@ and ji $ne@- (716.a). yE@ is
not used before ji $ne@- with lexical tones in the sense ‘hold’.

"3.5.3.2Post-Sonorant Syncope (verbs)There are a number of processes that have in common the effect of weakening
or deleting a short vowel in the environment #(C)vC2_C3v, i.e., in a second
syllable (counting from the left) when the short vowel is flanked by single
consonants. The flanking consonants as well as the metrical position are
important factors in how these rules work. These processes are applicable only
to verbs (and their Verbal Nouns).
One process applies to (C)vC2v verb stems when followed by a a suffixinitial coronal consonant. It has some similarity to the Inter-Word u-Apocope
(75), see §3.5.4.2 (below), but it applies to all vowel qualities and has some
other distinguishing features. As a productive process, the rule can be
summarized as (60). Some lexically restricted extensions are considered below.
(60)Post-Sonorant Syncope (verbs)
A short vowel is deleted (syncopated) if…
a) it is in the metrically weak second syllable of a (C)vCv stem; and
b) it is preceded by a (coronal) rhotic {r r<}; and
c) it is followed by a suffix-initial coronal {t d n s l r} or y, or by
Linker ti@ (§15.1.16); and
d) the first syllable of the (C)vCv stem has a short vowelCondition (60.a) relates to the comments about abstract metrical structure in
§3.2.2, above. Condition (60.d) is less a dynamic process than a constraint on
Post-Sonorant Syncope designed to prevent adverse consequences, since
syncopating the second vowel of (C)v˘Cv would create a superheavy syllable.
The inclusion of suffix-initial y as a conditioning factor for verbs only in (60.c)3.5 Segmental phonological rules57is interesting, but also somewhat circular, since the suffix in question (Perfective -yE$-/-ya$-) is itself an allomorph that can only be added to a bisyllabic
stem if this is a syncopating rhotic-medial stem (the suffix can also be added to
Cv˘- monosyllabic stems, §10.1.2.3).
While Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is almost always implemented in
conversational speech, in formal elicitation I have recorded unsyncopated
variants with suffixes other than Perfective -yE$-/-ya$-.
Most examples involve AN suffixes. However, the syncope process can
also occur when a verb is followed by Linker ti@ in a verb- or VP-chain
(§15.1.16), as in … ka@n ti@ me$y ‘make … (and …)’ from ka@r<a@- ‘do, make’.
The process does not apply in nominal compounds: tç$rç$-tu$mo@ ‘mountain
boulder’.
Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) feeds two other rules that disguise the identity
of an underlying rhotic. Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1) converts r< (which cannot
occur syllable-finally) to n. Rhotic Assimilation (77) (§3.5.5.2) assimilates r
totally to the following coronal consonant, resulting in a geminate, as already
seen in (60), above. Therefore the outputs are nC from underlying /r<vC/, and
geminate C˘ from underlying /rvC/, where C is the coronal. Note that e.g. tt
resulting from Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) can only reflect /rt/, since syncope
does not apply between underlying t’s: ja@tE$ ja@tE@-ti $-Ø ‘he did a calculation’.
Post-Sonorant Syncope also feeds Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization (79).
Examples of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) are ga&y-ya$ ‘pass.Perf’ from stem
ga$ra@- and ye$l-li@- ‘not come.Perf’ from stem yE$rE@- (see next paragraph). There
are many such (C)vC2v- verbs with r or r< as C2, and there are plenty of
coronal-initial AN (aspect-negation) suffixes that can follow them (Perfective
-ti -$ , Resultative -sa$-, Recent Perfect -jE$-, Experiential Perfect -tE@rE$-,
Imperfective -tç@ƒç$-).
In the case of yE$rE@- ‘come’, Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is irregularly
accompanied by a change in vowel quality from E to e. Thus unsuffixed
Imperfective yE$rE^˘-Ø ‘he/she will come’, Imperfective Negative yE$rE$-go@-Ø
‘he/she will not come’, but suffixed Perfective ye&y-ya$-Ø ‘he/she came’,
ye$l-li@-Ø ‘he/she did not come’, etc. No similar vocalic change occurs with e.g.
bE$rE@- ‘get’.
The phonological scope of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) seems to be
expanding, but in a lexicalized way. One expansion is in the direction of
including nasal n along with {r r<} as the preceding consonants that licence
syncope. While most Cvnv- stems do not allow syncope, the important verb
ku@no@- ‘put’ does optionally syncopate before the same coronal-initial suffixes:
ku@no@-ti $- or ku@n-ti -$ ‘put.Perf’. This may have been suggested by the
phonologically (and semantically) similar verb ku@r<o@- ‘put on, wear (garment)’,
which regularly syncopates like other Cvr<v- stems: Perfective ku@n-ti $ ‘wore’.
Because of Derhoticization, the syncopated forms of ku@no@- ‘put’ and of ku@r<o@-58Phonology‘wear’ are homophonous as [ku@n-]. There is no compelling practical need to
distinguish ‘put (object)’ from ‘put on, wear (garment)’, which overlap lexically
in many languages (English put and put on, French mettre).
Syncopated variants were also occasionally observed with u@no@- ‘put down’
(Perf u@n-ti -$ varying with u@no@-ti $-) and mu$no@- ‘braid’ (Imperfective
mu&n-tç@ƒç$-). Note that ku@no@-, u@no@-, and mu$no@- share a segmental shape
(C)uno- with u in the first syllable. I did not observe syncope with e.g. na$na@‘chase away’, pa@na@- ‘butcher’, sa@na@- ‘undo braids’, or pi@ne@- ‘shut (door)’.
A second extension is in the direction of allowing the first stem syllable to
have a long vowel. There is one Cv˘rv- verb that syncopates, namely jE$˘rE@‘bring’. The verb appears in syncopating suffixal environments as /je&r-/, which
invariably undergoes Rhotic Assimilation (77), as in Perfective je&t-ti $- (likewise
je$s-sa$-, je$l-li@-, etc.). The long vowel is shortened and raised from E˘ to e. It
may be that the central irregularity is that jE$˘rE@- is shortened in syncopating
environments; this then undergoes regular Post-Sonorant Syncope (60).
However, there is no shortening of jE$˘rE@- in e.g. Imperfective Negative
jE$˘rE$-go@-, i.e. where the suffix does not begin with a coronal. The lexicalization
of syncopation for jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’ is demonstrated by the failure of the homonym
jE$˘rE@- ‘criticize’ to syncopate: je&t-ti $- ‘bring-Perf’ versus jE$˘rE@-ti -$ ‘criticizePerf’. The other case like jE$˘rE@- is the combination of Habitual AN suffix -a@˘ra$with following (stative) Negative -la@- (§11.4.3). A form like be@˘-ra$-la@-Ø ‘it
doesn’t happen’ optionally syncopates to be^˘-l-la@-Ø.
There is one other (optionally) syncopating verb that has both medial n (like
ku@no@- ‘put’) and a long vowel (like jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’), namely mç$˘-nç@- ‘bring
together’ (also ‘gather, assemble’). For example, syncopated Perfective
mç&˘-n-ti -$ varies freely with unsyncopated mç$˘-nç@-ti -$ . Unlike jE$˘rE@-, mç$˘-nç@does not shorten its long vowel when it syncopates. mç$˘-nç@- is the causative of
mç$r<ç@- ‘come together’ (50.a), which of course also syncopates.
Extended exemplification of regular and irregular Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60) with verb-suffix combinations is given in (61), using Perfective allomorphs
-ti -$ or -ya$-. Rhotic Assimilation (77) is also seen in (61.a-b), and Derhoticization is at work in (61.c).

Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) does not apply when C2 is a consonant (even a
sonorant) other than a rhotic, aside from the few cases of n just mentioned. In
particular, if C2 is l, syncope does not occur: ka@la@-ti -$ ‘park.Perf’, sa@la@-ti $‘pray.Perf’. Likewise, if C2 is non-coronal, syncope does not apply before a
cororal C3, hence gç$Nç@-ti -$ ‘spin.Perf’. With the exception of jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’, the
rule does not apply to Cv˘Cv- stems or to trisyllabic stems even if all other
factors are favorable: ga$˘r<a@-ti ‘mix.Perf’, ji $˘rE@-ti -$ ‘mix.Perf’, so@go@ro@-ti $‘(unseen object) make a noise.Perf’, ga$ma$r<a@-ti -$ ‘divide.Perf’.
However, there is a single bisyllabic verb with a medial velar nasal that
undergoes optional syncope when the suffix (or pronominal subject clitic) also
begins with a velar. The verb is ta@Na@- ‘happen’, and the triggering morpheme is
either Imperfective Negative -go@- or (in the unsuffixed Imperfective)
Nonhuman subject pronominal kç$.
(62)a. ta@Na@kç$
b. ta$Na$-go@-Ø= ta@Nkç$
= ta$N-go@-Ø‘it will happen’
‘it will not happen’Since the flanking consonants in ta@Nkç$ and ta$N-go@-Ø constitute
homorganic (velar) nasal-stop pairs, there is a clear similarity between this and60Phonologyexamples involving coronals in (61), especially ku@n-ti $- in (61.d). Syncope does
not occur when the suffix begins in a non-velar C, such as 3Pl ta@Na@-ba$.
I have been unable to find examples of Post-Sonorant Syncope (60)
involving labials. The candidates would be verbs like ka@ma@- ‘toss (cowries)’
with 3Pl subject suffix -ba$. However, informants insisted on e.g. imperfective
ka@ma@-ba$ ‘they toss (cowries)’, and I never heard syncopated forms of the type
#ka@m-ba$.
Another context where Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) occurs is in suffixal
derivation of verbs, when Reversive suffix -rv- is added to a Cvrv- stem (there
is also one example involving a Cvr<v- stem). Here the output of Syncope is
modified by yet another CC-cluster adjustment, this time /rr/ (or /r<r/)
appearing as ll, see Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization (§3.5.5.3, below). In (63.a),
the unsyncopated form of the Reversive is illustrated. In (63.b), we see PostRhotic Symcope and Rhotic-Cluster Lateralization. For more on reversives, see

example, if tE@m-nE@- ‘make (sth) wet’ is interpreted as the causative of tE@mE@‘become wet’, syncope must be assumed. However, tE@m-nE@- is more reasonably

Maghrebi Arabic aw´lla ‘or’.

‘They (=elders) have them (=circumcised boys) sleep on hides, but they
don’t let them sleep on mats; or else they have them sleep on wooden
planks.’ 2004.3.188 Postpositions and adverbialsJamsay makes use of postpositions for dative and spatiotemporal cases. The
purest postposition, bearing no relationship to any noun, is le$, which has several
grammatical functions. Several other postpositions are based on noun stems.
These include complex postpositions that themselves consist of a noun plus
postposition, requiring a complement in the form of a possessor (cf. English at
the back of…). There are also some postpositions in the form of a noun with an
overlaid locative H(H…)L tone melody (tonal locatives).
A postpositional phrase (PP) is of the basic form [NP Postposition], but it
may be extended by adding a universal quantifier cE^w or fu@˘ ‘all’ (in emphatic
sense), or by a particle like ka^˘< ‘also’. (435.a) has fu@˘ after a PP, in a different
sense than we get when fu@˘ occurs at the end of the NP complement of the
postposition (435.b). (435.c) illustrates ka^˘< ‘also’ (§19.1.3). (435.d) has cE^w
‘all’ after a PP, and also shows how a PP can be treated like a noun, specifically
as a (descriptive) “possessor” with following Possessive ma$.

‘He will summon the people from throughout (i.e. from both of)

numerous lexical adverbials in Jamsay. Some of these are noun-like, e.g. words
with senses like ‘yesterday’, which (in their adverbial function) can be thought
of as covert PPs with a zero postposition, just as in English (yesterday for ?on
yesterday). However, there are other adverbials of a more protean variety, not
easily connected to any other stem-class. These include intensifiers associated
with adjectives (§6.3.3.2), and an interesting set of expressive adverbials, some
examples of which are given in §8.5.8. The intensifiers and expressive
adverbials resemble regular adjectives in their ability to occur in predicative
function with a following ‘be’ quasi-verb, but even here the similarity is
superficial, in that the usual negative (‘not be’) counterparts are different; see
§11.4.3. Adverbials, even though some have adjective-like sense (e.g. ‘straight’,
‘tilting’), are not used in adnominal modifying function and do not take number
suffixes.","[303, 304, 305]"
"24Sketchd. (quasi-)focalization type
verb inflected for AN category but not for pronominal subject;
unsuffixed Perfective verb has all-L tones;
pronominal subject expressed by H-toned independent pronoun;
direct object not in possessor or compound-initial form.
examples:
focalization construction (chapter 13);
‘see’ complement in recognition sense (§17.3.4.2).
e. strong-nominalization type
verb is nominalized;
no AN categories expressed;
object expressed as compound initial or as alienable possessor;
subject expressed as alienable possessor if no object intervenes;
if object present, pronominal subject expressed as outer possessor
examples:
‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2);
Verbal Noun clause (§17.4).
f. compound type
object and verb are fused into a compound of type [n$ v^]
example:
reduced purposive clause in compound form (§17.6.3)3 Phonology3.1GeneralThe prosodic structure, involving tone patterns and vocalic lengthening, is
deeply intertwined with the morphosyntax. The segmental phonology has some
intricacies, but there are few disfiguring phonological processes that make it
difficult to identify stems and other morphemes in texts. Exception: PostSonorant Syncope (60) and the consonantal assimilation rules that it feeds can
disguise the identity of (C)vCv- words and stems. An example of this is bE$rE@‘get’, Perfective Negative bE$l-li@- (via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)). In examples in later chapters, I frequently list the full form
of lexical items disguised in this way in parentheses after the free translation.
There being no voiced bilabial or labiodental fricative v, I use the symbol
“v” for any short vowel, “v˘” for any long vowel, and uppercase “V” as the
unmarked symbol for any vowel (long or short). The symbol for “syllable” is .","[45, 46, 47]"
