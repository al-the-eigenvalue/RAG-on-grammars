"Basic constituent order is VSO (order of direct object and
oblique may vary).
Fronting of NP's (or other elements) to the left of the verb
is a possibility under pragmatically marked conditions.
There is a tendency to move given information to end of the
clause (relative to the order of direct object and oblique).
The language is agglutinative and polysynthetic.
There is essentially no nominal case marking for subject and
object (but Set II clitics have case/pronominal features).
Relative clauses are post-head.
Descriptive modifiers are post-head.",[407]

"18 Marantz (1985) suggests that causative formation in
numerous
languages,
including strictly morphological causation, is the result
of
‘morphological
merger'
of
ounderlyingly
distinct
syntactic
elements. This general approach has long been espoused by scholars of
Eskimo languages, and has
promise
for
the
Yagua
data.
However,
morphological
causation should be differentiated in a principled way
from analytical causation, particularly when both occur in
the
same
language,
such
that one, but not the other, undergoes morphological
merger. It is also not clear to me the extent to which this
sort
of
analysis
should
be
extended
to all categories of possible ‘higher
