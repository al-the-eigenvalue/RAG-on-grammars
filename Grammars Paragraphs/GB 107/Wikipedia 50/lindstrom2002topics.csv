"9TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTAll the stems in this set (in their simple or complex form) can be affixed with
third person prefixes and used as demonstratives (cf. 1.1.1 above). Note the
difference in use as locational/directional vs. demonstrative:
(14)u-on\ma tie
3mS-sit there
‘he sits/sat there’(locational, adverbial use)(15)u-on\ma i-tie
3mS-sit 3m-there
‘he/that one sits/sat’(demonstrative, nominal use)(16)u-on\ma [i-tie
mikana]
3mS-sit 3m-there man
‘the/that man sits/sat’(demonstrative, adnominal use)1.1.6
Adverbs and adverbial clitics
There is a fairly rich set of adverbs in Kuot, covering categories such as time
and manner. Some appear to be related to words in other word classes, and
many end in /t/ which may at one stage have been an adverb-forming derivation, but there is synchronically no productive way of forming adverbs. Adverbs
are invariant in form, and relatively free in syntactic terms, although there is a
preference for the second position in the predicate.
There is also a set of six adverbial enclitics which attach to the first constituent
in the phrase to which they belong (and thereby provide a nice criterion for
phrase-hood). The continuous aspect particle mǝn is not counted when “first
constituent” is sought. The enclitics have meanings such as ‘just’, ‘now’, ‘still;
yet; first’, ‘emphatic’ (example (17)), ‘also’ and ‘a little’ (example (18)). The
aspect enclitic =rǝ occurs in the same a lot as the adverbial clitics, but is mutually incompatible with them.
1.1.7
Negation
There are several types of negation in Kuot, and most have an association with
non-future verbal morphology, even in future temporal reference. The most
general negator is tǝle, which negates any type of predicate. It occurs before the
negated constituent:
(17)Tǝle=kan
[u-me
ubi]
NEG=EMPH 3mS-HAB work=Ø
‘He didn’t use to work’(18)tǝlekakarat, kakkaliat=arokan.
NEG near
far=a.little(.more)
‘it wasn’t near, it was rather far.’There is a variant tǝla which is used in future contexts (with non-future verbal
morphology).
An interesting alternative for general negation is mani, normally the question
word ‘what’. It is particularly common in the northern Kuot-speaking area. The
use as a negation appears to have developed from an ironic formulation (something like ‘you think what, he worked??’ meaning ‘he didn’t work’), and retains
10INTRODUCTION: GRAMMATICAL OVERVIEWtraces of question intonation. It also differs from tǝle in that tǝle is part of the
phrase it negates, as evidenced by the placement of adverbial clitics like =kan
‘EMPH’ (as in (17)), while mani is not:
(19)mani u-la=kan
u-onǝma
what 3mS-go=EMPH 3mS-sit
‘he didn’t go and sit down’The negative existential karuk ‘is.not’ or ‘there isn’t’ is also used as ‘no’. In the
negative existential use, the thing which is not is sometimes expressed with the
preposition me ‘to, for’, but more often with a PossI possessive, as in this example:
(20)Karuk=kan ma
lop
is.not=EMPH 3p.PossI child.nsg
‘There are no children here’tiro
hereThe types of negation so far mentioned are associated with a particular intonation contour (see 3.6).
Prohibitive (i.e. negative imperative) is expressed by the particle buat7, which is
also used with non-future forms (while imperative in positive polarity is expressed only by future forms of the verbal morphology, where available):
(21)Buatma-mi-lo!
PROHIB 3pO-2pS-tell
‘Don’t tell them!’butMa-mi-loa!
3pO-2pS-tell.fut
‘Tell them!’The apprehensive marker bun (and related forms), sometimes translated ‘lest’,
is also used with non-future verbal morphology:
(22)U-rau,
nǝmo bun me-nǝmu-a
ga me-o.
3mS-be.afraid COMPL APPR 3pS-kill-3mO and 3pS-eat.3sO
‘He was afraid lest they kill and eat him.’(The future forms of the verbs here would be me-nǝmu-ŋ and me-oŋ.)
1.1.8
Clauses
A clause can minimally consist of a verb (or adjective) with cross-referencing
morphology. Clauses with two full noun phrases do occur but not very often,
one or zero being more common.
The unmarked constituent order in Kuot is predicate-initial with optional noun
phrases for core arguments: V (S) (O). Subject and object are cross-referenced
by affixes/enclitics on the verb:
(23)o-ikat=oŋ
Adam [muabari
3fO-check=3mS A.
sun/clock(f)
‘Adam checked his watch’aŋ]
3m.PossII.s(24)[nǝmo o-u-uluan]

kuraima]
nirobu
want 3fO-3mS-follow 3m-there ‘some’ bush.spirit(m) coconut.palm(f)
‘this bush spirit wanted to follow the coconut palm (up)’7 Buat is homonymous with and possibly related to the particle marking habitual.","[30, 31, 32]"
"13TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTkum, adverb), ‘be where’ (lak-, adjective), ‘when; how many’ (namuk, adverb).
Mani ‘what’ has the form man when used together with a noun (man kukuom?
‘what/which tree?’). ‘How’ is expressed by ‘like what’, are mani, and ‘why’ by
‘for what’, me mani.
Aka ‘who’ and mani ‘what’ tend to be topicalised (fronted), but can be left in
the normal position of the item asked about; the interrogative adverbs lakum
and namuk can be topicalised too (namuk is usually topicalised in the sense
‘when’). When fronted, question words are treated the same as other constituents and the construction is marked with the relator lǝ. Question-word questions
have their own intonation contour (see 3.6.).
The interrogative nouns and adverbs have indefinite uses corresponding to
‘whoever’, ‘whatever’, ‘wherever’, ‘whenever/however-many’. Mani can further be used as a negator as described in 1.1.7 above.
Yes/no questions are marked only by intonation; primarily a sharp rise on the
last syllable (see 3.6). If an affirmative answer is expected a tag a can be added
to the end of the sentence – this then carries the high pitch. In replying, aa ‘yes’
to a question in negative polarity confirms the proposition including the negation (i.e., ‘yes’ to the question ‘Won’t you come tomorrow?’ means that the
person will not come).
1.1.8.3 Tense/irrealis
The only temporal distinction that is consistently marked in Kuot is future vs.
non-future. The category called future here could also be analysed as irrealis,
but each analysis has some problems and I have chosen to use the label “future”
for this grammatical category. There are two expressions of future: the particle
e(ba), and some verbal morphology (see 1.1.2 above).
The future morphological alternations are the only marking of imperative (in
positive polarity). They are sometimes also the only expression of immediate
future. They are further triggered by the use of the future particles e (immediate
future) or eba (future), and are optionally used after the auxiliary verb -ga
‘want; be about to’.
Eba in turn has several contexts of use. It always conditions future verbal morphology. In addition to plain future temporal reference, it is used to mark a kind
of procedural habitual; in clause complements of the preposition me as mentioned above; in clause complements of the verb puo ‘be able to’ (with the relator lǝ); and optionally in if–then constructions (more often in the ‘then’ clause
but possible in either or both).
Future morphology and eba do not co-occur with several types of negation: the
future negator tǝla, the prohibitive marker buat, and the apprehensive marker
bun (and related forms).
1.2
Kuot as a linguistic type
Predicate-initial languages are rare in the region, and Kuot is possibly unique
among non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages in this respect.
14INTRODUCTION: KUOT AS A LINGUISTIC TYPEThe Polynesian outlier languages of Takuu (Mortlock) and Nukuria (Fead) in
Bougainville Province (Papua New Guinea) are probably VSO since this is the
dominant structure in Polynesian languages, but I have no specific information
on these.10 The nearest other VSO language would be Austronesian Roviana in
the New Georgia island group in the Solomon Islands. Surrounding Austronesian languages on New Ireland are all SVO. As regards other non-Austronesian
languages in the region, most seem to be SVO (Baining, Taulil and Butam,
Sulka, Kol, Ata and Anêm in New Britain, and Bilua in the Solomon Islands;
Taulil seems to have the option VS for some stative clauses), or SOV (Rotokas,
Nasioi, Buin and Motuna on Bougainville, and Lavukaleve, Savosavo and Touo
(Baniata) in the Solomon Islands).11 Non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages on
New Guinea island are predominantly verb-final.
Although word order may not always be the best indicator of other structures in
a language, it may be interesting to look at how various features in Kuot pattern
together.
In Greenberg’s first formulation of word order universals (Greenberg 1990
[1963]), a harmonic VSO language should have the features given in the lefthand column in Table 3 (which is not exhaustive – only the major and most often quoted features are included). In terms of these features, Kuot shows up as a
harmonic language, matching all the major features, as indicated by pluses in
the second column.

11 Unfortunately, most of these languages are as yet very incompletely described. Inmost cases I have gleaned the information from a few reproduced sentences, so it is
not certain that these are representative of a larger sample. Only for Bilua and Lavukaleve did I have access to full grammars: Terrill (1999) for Lavukaleve and Obata
(2000) for Bilua.","[34, 35, 36]"
"133TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT4.1.10 Demonstratives
Semantics: Exophoric deixis (pointing in physical space); encode location,
proximity, or direction, of an entity with respect to the deictic centre. Also
many anaphoric uses; some stems are restricted to this function, and some stems
have temporal meaning. Third person only; also function as third person pronouns.
Morphology: 1. Simple demonstratives: deictic invariant forms indexing third
person masculine, feminine, dual and plural.
2. Composite demonstratives consisting of: the simple demonstratives prefixed
to A) simple or complex forms from the paradigm of locationals and directionals; or B) to stems only used in the demonstrative paradigm.
Syntax: Head of noun phrase; or determiner, normally preceding the head.
Indicate location of an entity, in predicate use in verbless constructions.
Sub-classes: 1. Simple stems, indexing third person categories; 2. Stems used
only in composite forms (making up the second part of the form).
4.1.11Particles, adverbial and aspectual clitics, conjunctions, and
interjections
This heading subsumes a varied group of forms, which are brought together
here by virtue of being short and invariant and having mainly grammatical
functions, although on other criteria they form multiple classes. The headings in
the following indicate the categorisations.
Particles in the predicate:
 tense (e, eba, ba FUTure; procedural habitual; ‘if’, ‘then’)
 aspect (mǝn CONTinuous, buat HABitual)
 mood (lǝma ‘if’)
 for NEGation, negative existential, PROHIBitive, and APPRehensive.
Particles in the noun phrase: Specificity (non, ba).
Other particles: ORDinal numeral.
There are six adverbial clitics and one aspectual clitic (=arǝ), all of which attach to the first constituent of their phrase.
Conjunctions: ga ‘and’, pa ‘but’, o ‘or’, lǝ RELator, me ‘for, to (prep.)’.
Interjections: karuk ‘no’, aa ‘yes’; also words such as mikat (adv.) ‘true!’, kuot
‘what, really?!’, me (prep. ‘for, to’) ‘why?!’.
The language further has pronominal enclitics and pronominal and other affixes. The interrelations of the various types of forms in Kuot will be discussed
in terms of cohesion and dependency in the following section.
4.2
Morphology
Kuot morphology is mainly agglutinative, with some morphologically conditioned phonological processes across morpheme boundaries. Affixes and encli134WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: MORPHOLOGYtics mark subject on verbs and adjectives; and affixes mark object, reciprocal
and reflexive on verbs, as well as agreement on demonstratives and prepositions. Suffixes indicate non-singular and dual on nouns. Enclitics further express aspect and several adverbial meanings; these cliticize to the first constituent in a phrase. There are also particles with various grammatical functions. Reduplication is partly productive in verb class I. Synchronically, there is no compounding of stems. Three morphological categories are expressed (at least in
part) through stem-internal changes: future stem forms in verb classes II and III;
plural formation of nouns, and nominalisation of verbs of classes II and III and
of adjectives.
The bulk of productive affixal morphological marking is thus concerned with
the categories of number, gender and the person. Derivation is not prominent in
Kuot, and the only productive derivational morphology in the language derives
action nominals from verbs of classes II and III (e.g., nulibap ‘crying’ from
class II -liba ‘cry’) and adjectives (e.g., sasarapunim ‘wetness, moisture’ from
sasarap- ‘wet’); and class I verbs from adjectives.
This section discusses the types of morphemes that can be distinguished in
Kuot: stems, affixes, clitics and particles, and possessives (which fall outside
these categories). They are investigated in terms of phonological and morphological dependency and form variability. It will be seen that although the traditional morphological categories provide a framework for categorising the types
of morphemes, they do not give a sufficiently detailed grid to capture the full
variation found in Kuot morphology.2
It was found that applying criteria of morphological dependency to all morphemes in the language would give results that are not very useful for characterising the morphemes in question. Ranging the morphemes from most independent to most dependent would give something like the following (selected morphemes):
INDEPENDENTadverbs, particles
nouns (singular)
verb class I
clitics
verb classes II and III, adjectives, affixes.
DEPENDENTIt is particularly unsatisfactory to have lexical stems with the affixes. This situation arises because stems of verb classes II and III and adjectives are bound
forms, requiring affixes (and incomprehensible to native speakers in un-affixed
form). Morphologically, they are as bound as the affixes themselves. It was
therefore decided to investigate stems separately from other morphemes. The
2 One type of morphology that will not be discussed here is reduplication, and the stemaugment in the locational/directional paradigm will also not be considered here.","[155, 156, 157]"
"144WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: WORDfuture, and also a procedural past habitual, and has some irrealis-like functions.
Finally, tǝle (future form tǝla) is the general negation.
17. The prohibitive (i.e. negative imperative) marker is the particle buat (homonymous with the habitual auxiliary particle mentioned in 16.). It is presented
on a line of its own because it can make up an utterance (‘Don’t!’), although it
is usually part of a predicate.
18. Last in Table 2 we have the continuous aspect particle mǝn. It has relatively
free distribution in the predicate, and can even occur several times in different
positions in the same predicate, or occasionally make up a predicate on its own.
As mentioned, it is not counted when the first constituent is determined for the
placement of a clitic.
1, 12, and 18, being on the boundaries between affix, clitic and particle, are interesting. The first is no longer a productive suffix, but shares features with the
non-singular suffix which is productive. The subject enclitics of verb class I are
affix-like in terms of selectivity, but clitic-like in terms of cohesion. The continuous particle mǝn is an invariant grammatical morpheme like the other particles, but its position is less strictly determined by syntax, and it has the potential
of being used as a predicate.
4.2.3
Paradigms without stems: possessives
One group of morphemes that has not been discussed in the above sections is
the alienable (PossII) and inalienable (PossI) possessive paradigms. Each has
forms indexing twelve pronominal categories of possessor, and the alienable set
further index three to four categories of possessee (third person only; not all
forms distinguish masculine and feminine). The reason why they have not been
included is that they are only partly segmentable. For the inalienable set, each
form can be said to be a portmanteau consisting of pronominal.category+
possessive. There is thus no stem to segment out. In the alienable forms, the
first part of each form indexes the possessor, and the second part the possessee,
but again, there is no stem that remains constant in all the forms and which
could be glossed ‘possessive’. There is also a small set of interrogative possessives, which do have a base (or stem) au- to which the endings indicating 3m,
3f, 3d and 3p are added.4
4.3
Word
Criteria for a unit word can be phonological or grammatical.5 In Kuot,
phonological criteria are not helpful for defining a unit word. Stress is lexical
and not determined with reference to units such as syllables or moras in relation
to word boundaries, and phonological rules make reference to syllables but not
to words (and morpho-phonological rules apply only to certain morphology).
4 Other question words fit quite well into other word classes (noun, adjective, adverb,verb), and have not been included in this presentation.
5 These sometimes yield different results, as in Boumaa Fijian (Dixon 1988).","[166, 167]"
"Another example from the same speaker in the same text, this time as quoted
speech, shows the same pitch contour (towards the end of the example), but
here we have a combination of negators, namely karuk, the negative existential,
also meaning ‘no’, and a clause with tǝle negating the adjective mur- ‘good’:
(92)Nǝmo “Karuk, tǝle=ka mu-mur-um.”
NEG=yet RED-good-3p
say
no
‘He said “No, they’re not good yet.”’Figure 9: Negated clause intonation (female speaker: KD).",[142]
"From the examples given above, it would appear that pitch in Kuot is tied up
with expressing clause type to the extent that other uses are largely blocked; in
particular, as we have seen, stress is expressed by duration rather than pitch.
Regarding paralinguistic meanings such as surprise and anger, the absence of
observations may be a direct effect of the type of data: narrative monologue is
likely to have significantly less emotive expression than dialogue. Cruttenden
expresses doubt about the type of association between sentence type and tune
that I have tried to demonstrate for Kuot:
In some languages (not English) […] the use of particular tunes is closely tied to
functional sentence-types, e.g. where statement, yes/no question, and command
regularly involve certain tunes. From most of the descriptions of intonation in
languages other than English, one might imagine that this was the principal use
of various tunes in intonation languages. It may indeed be true that many languages do use intonation less for attitudinal purposes than English, but the suspicion exists that an alignment of tunes with sentence-types is merely the easy way
to investigate intonation and often more sophisticated attitudinal and discoursal
uses remain undocumented. (Cruttenden 1986: 10)I would argue that the patterns found in Kuot are valid at least for the narrative
genre, but agree that more detailed analysis is needed, in several areas. It is
likely that more patterns can be found, associated with other clause types (for
example, imperative, prohibitive and relative clauses are areas yet to be investigated). Ladd (2001: 1383) makes the observation that languages may use the
same tune in several functions (as in Kuot’s use of rising pitch for both topicalisation and other kinds of non-finality), and also points out that languages appear
to vary in the number of tunes that they make use of. What seems extraordinary
about Kuot is the degree of specialisation of tunes, perhaps especially in func122PHONOLOGY: OTHER SPEECH SOUNDS, HESITATION AND EMPHASIStions that are also expressed lexically, such as question-word questions and negation. Investigation into further clause types and functions may show some recurrence of tunes, or it may expand the inventory of tunes even further.
Other related areas for further research include: the expression of prominence
on particular constituents, such as new information and contrastive focus, and
the interaction of such features with clause intonation; the expression of attitude; genre-related variation; and meta-linguistic parameters such as politeness
(which, impressionistically, is expressed by speaking softly).
3.7
Other speech sounds, hesitation and emphasis
There are a number of phenomena that are not part of the phonology as such,
but which nevertheless deserve mention here. They are brought together in this
section.
An alternative but relatively infrequent way of expressing ‘yes’ (normally aa) is
on an ingressive pulmonic airstream. There are two variants. First, it can be
done with pursed lips; this produces a faintly whistling sound. Secondly, it can
be done with relaxed lips and vocal tract and mid-open jaw position, with voicing from about halfway through (like saying /ha/ or /hǝ/ while breathing in).
A further sound that is not part of the phonological system is a bilabial trill
([B]). This is produced by pulling the corners of the mouth to the sides and a
little bit down, and briefly emitting air between the lips. It has only one use:
‘no’ or ‘I don’t know’ between people who know each other, and is particularly
favoured by children.
Glottal stops occur in some exclamations and in hesitation, without being part
of the phonological system. Both the word for ‘yes’, aa, and a general exclamation of surprise or consternation, e (or eh), are frequently produced with glottal
stops, either at the beginning or the end or both. An eʔ with a glottal stop also
often signals self-repair – the speaker breaks off his or her utterance with eʔ!
and then starts the repair. Repairs have not yet been the subject of close study,
but one common strategy in conversation is breaking off the utterance with eʔ,
then repeating the inappropriate lexeme often followed by gǝt ‘again’ with
question intonation, then filling in the correct word.
There are several patterns of hesitation. Most speakers have frequent brief
pauses, sometimes between clauses, but also in between elements of the same
clause or phrase (such as in the third graph of Figure 7). Some but not all speakers recorded have filled pauses, using vowels such as [ǝ] or [ɛ]. Longer pauses
are very frequently filled by filler words while the speaker searches for the right
lexeme; typically any phrase-initial grammatical material will be produced first,
and then the filler takes the place of the lexical item, while the speaker searches
for the correct word. The fillers are: an ambitransitive class III verb mat-bǝ for
verbs and adjectives, with full agreement marking; and a noun mare/maro
(masc./fem; dl: marǝpien, nsg: marǝp) for nominals, i.e., nouns and personal
names. This noun is sometimes used as a normal noun with the sense ‘thing’,
and is unique among Kuot nouns in having separate forms for masculine and
123TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTfeminine singular, and there is even a special form marǝn for place names. Both
the filler predicate and the filler nominal are then usually replaced by the right
form, often with a copy of the intonation used with the filler. Sometimes the
filler is left in place without correction or specification; in other cases the right
word is filled in directly or after several intervening syllables.
Emphasis is a complex phenomenon, and no typology will be attempted here.
Without further analysis, I will simply point to two salient expressions of it in
Kuot: lengthening and articulatory energy. Emphasis is often expressed through
lengthening of a segment. Usually, this is the segment with the most relevant
semantic content for the context, but occasionally other segments in the structure receive lengthening. In the following example and figure, the speaker is
telling of his grandfather who was a phenomenal bird catcher, and at this point
comes to find his net full of birds. The elongated segment is the second syllable
of kukuom ‘tree’ (possibly because it is phrase-final), which has a duration of
0.6 seconds. It is also spoken at quite a high pitch for a male speaker, around
220 Hz:
(97)Dak=ieŋ
kukuom ga [nǝmo
kkof=meŋ] muareip
be.full=3fS tree(f)
and be.about.to break=3pS branch.nsg
‘The tree was full and the branches were about to break’Figure 14: Emphasis by lengthening (male speaker: SEL).","[144, 145, 146]"
"Intonation is high across the phrase, and there is a rise on the last syllable (although the /i/ in -sik is very short in the second instance), a common way of
signalling topicalisation in Kuot (cf. 3.6 below). The relative difference in dura-116PHONOLOGY: INTONATIONtion in the first two syllables of the words remains although the intonational
prominence is on -sik.
In summary, pitch is used primarily for intonation (the topic of the next section), while word stress is achieved primarily through duration.
Stress shift is occasionally an exponent of a grammatical category. This is the
case for future forms of some class II verbs (the future particle e(ba) would
normally have to be present too), e.g.:
(88)i-abǝ ['jabǝ]
i-aba [ja'ba]3fS-climb – she climbs/climbed
3fS-climb.fut – she (will) climbA further factor concerning stress is that some grammatical morphemes often,
but not always, attract stress. In particular, this concerns the non-singular suffix
-(i)p on nouns, and the subject enclitics of verb class I. As mentioned in 3.3.1, a
possible analysis for the contrasting pairs duk ‘1. break (of rope), 2. thunder’,
and ut ‘1. be full, 2. be like’ could be that one member in each pair carries inherent stress. It was shown for duk that the sense ‘thunder’ gave a longer word
when carrying the subject enclitic than the sense ‘break’ (at least in the two instances recorded); this could be due to the combination of two stressed syllables. Interactions of these kinds are complex, and detailed analysis is beyond
the scope of the present study.
3.6
Intonation
In many languages, yes/no questions and non-finality are signalled by pitch
(typically by a rise at the end of the utterance). Kuot does this, but goes further,
and has specific intonation patterns for several more clause types, where each of
the specialised pitch contours, or tunes, pertains to a particular function or
clause type. The most salient intonation patterns in Kuot are
• declarative, non-final (rising; including topicalised constituents)
• declarative, final (falling)
• negated clause
• question-word question
• yes/no question
Each of these will be illustrated by pitch curves generated from recorded narrative speech (including cited speech for questions). The genre imposes some
limitations on data; for example I think that clarification questions and echo
questions would differ from those reported below (but unfortunately I have no
recorded conversational material). Within the genre, however, the observations
appear quite stable. Pitch extractions were performed in response to the auditory
impression that “there was something going on with intonation in negated
clauses” (etc.), and the impression was borne out in the first few examples that117TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTwere analysed instrumentally. The results remained stable when checked
against equivalent constructions from other speakers.16
The transcription in figures is phonemic but with lenition applied, as this can
influence pitch.
The pitch of a non-final clause rises, often quite sharply, on the last syllable of
the intonation unit, while final clause intonation usually consists in a fall over
the last few syllables, as seen in Figure 6, which shows the pitch extraction for
example (89) with a rise on todǝŋ and a fall over the clitics =ieŋ=arǝ:
(89)[Li-la=rǝ
dus=lioŋ] todǝŋ, kale=ieŋ=arǝ.

"142WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: MORPHOLOGY8. The action nominalisation process for verbs of classes II and III consists in
adding a suffix -(i)ap, but the subject slot must also be filled by the second person singular suffix (nu-). Most class II verbs can take this derivation.
9. The action nominalisation process for adjectives involves a suffix -(V)nim but
without subject marking (an example was given in the introduction to this section, under 4.2). The process is not fully productive and there is some irregularity.
10. Two items are listed under this number, separated by a broken line to indicate that they are not ordered with respect to one another. The future object
markers in verb class II are suffixes like the non-future ones (cf. 5. above), but
involve no phonological interaction with the stem. The object prefixes used in
verb class I and in the first and second person in classes II and III also do not interact with stems, but are constant in form.
11. Last among the affixes, we have the dual suffix -ien. It is added onto the
non-singular form of nouns, e.g.:
(3)maua-p-ien
‘two fruitbats’
fruit.bat-nsg-dlThe suffix itself is very regular, but in some cases the form to which it is added
is not the non-singular form normally used. The dual suffix is optional in the
sense that inanimates are usually not marked for dual, but is well integrated
with the word in that pausing never occurs before it.
The forms looked at so far are analysed as affixes on account of forming tight
units with the stems to which they adhere, and occurring with words of particular word classes (or sub-classes). We will now turn to forms analysed as clitics,
although the first one is somewhat intermediary between clitic and affix status.
12. The subject markers of verb class I are treated as clitics in this work, but deviate from the definition of clitics given above; while all other morphemes
identified as clitics have a distribution that makes reference to position within
the phrase, the subject markers of verb class I always attach to verb stems of
class I, being in that respect affix-like. The class I subject markers form a unit
with the verb stem, to which one of the other clitics can then attach, forming a
sequence of two units, as in (4), while the other clitics are mutually exclusive:
(4)U-tie,
3f-therepare=meŋ=arǝ
get.up=3pS=ASPmakaulǝp
woman.nsgga o-kima=meŋ=arǝ [u-sik
sǝgǝr]…
and 3fO-see=3pS=ASP 3f-DEM egg(f)
‘Alright, the women got up and saw this egg…’These subject markers are treated as clitics because of their low level of cohesion with the stem, as compared to the affixes. They show minimal phonological interaction with the verb stem; there are contexts where the slot is not obligatorily filled; and speakers frequently pause before the subject marker in dictating, and often separate it by a space when writing. It is clear that they are in143TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTtermediate between clitics and affixes in terms of Kuot morphological categories.
13. The next item is the first representative of the proper clitics, the aspect
marker =rǝ. It cliticises to the first constituent of the phrase (normally the verb
phrase).3 Only one clitic can go in this position, so =rǝ is in complementary
distribution with items 14. and 15. on the list, which are thus all mutually exclusive. As for all clitics with this distribution, the continuous aspect particle mǝn
is not counted when determining which is the first constituent. =rǝ shows some
phonological interaction with its host, in that it takes the form =arǝ following a
consonant. After a vowel, both =rǝ and =r are possible. It is presented separate
from the following clitics because it is different semantically: while the adverbial clitics in 14. and 15. have fairly distinct meanings, =rǝ is quite bleached
and its meaning depends largely on context.
14. The adverbial enclitics =it ‘just’ and several ones meaning ‘a little’ (slightly
different in form) also cliticise to the first constituent in the phrase to which
they belong. They interact with the phonological shape of their hosts in that the
initial vowel of the clitic is dropped if the host ends in a vowel, giving =t, =rom
etc. The meanings of these clitics and of those in 15. could be said to be lexical
rather than grammatical in character; i.e., their semantics is largely isolable and
corresponds to senses expressed by adverbs and similar words in most languages, and their use is determined by their semantics rather than grammatical
considerations such as tense or person.
15. This set of adverbial clitics share their distribution (and mutual exclusivity)
with the items given in 13. and 14. They differ from the latter in that they are
invariant forms, having no phonological interaction with their hosts (other than
general phonological process such as k→ɣ / V_V which apply everywhere in
the language when the conditions arise). Although the distribution is certainly
that of clitics, the fact that the forms are invariant makes this set similar to particles.
16. A diverse group of forms is given here, separated by dotted lines to indicate
that they are not ordered with respect to each other. They are all analysed as
particles here, because they are invariant forms, and their distribution is determined by syntactic rules applying on a phrase level but to each specifically,
with reference to particular other constituents (rather than simply the number of
constituents as for the majority of clitics). Onim (sometimes anim) indicates
origin in terms of place or time. Non ‘some’ and ba “one” belong to the noun
phrase and are to do with specificity. Nǝmo has a variety of functions and can
be an auxiliary or function as a complementiser. Buat marks habitual and is an
auxiliary in the verb phrase, synonymous with the auxiliary verb -me; it is further homonymous with the prohibitive particle; see 18. below). E/eba/ba marks3 This is reminiscent of the so called Wackernagel position, but in Kuot applies to thephrase rather than the clause.","[164, 165, 166]"
"145TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTThere is one exception to this, namely the restriction on final [r] in the northern
dialect of Kuot, giving e.g. burburu ‘stone wall’ where the southern dialect has
burbur, but even here it can be argued that the restriction applies to stems rather
than words, in that verb stems are subject to this restriction even when a subject
enclitic is present. Prosodic contours apply to units such as phrases and clauses
rather than to individual words. (See further Chapter 2, various sections.)
Morphological and syntactic criteria fare somewhat better. The order of morphemes within a word cannot be manipulated; suffixes must come after the stem
and prefixes first, such as the non-singular suffixes on nouns and the object prefixes of verbs. A well-formed grammatical word can thus consist of a stem plus
required grammatical morphology in the right order.6 A form not requiring morphological additions, such as a singular noun, an adverb or a particle can of
course also make up a well-formed grammatical word.
An enclitic also forms a single word with its host, in that enclitics are never
used independently. An important difference between affixes and clitics (except
the subject enclitic of verb class I) is that the former remain with their host if
the phrase is syntactically manipulated, while the clitics attach to any constituent which is first in the phrase at any particular time (excepting the continuous
particle mǝn).
While there is no Kuot word that matches perfectly to the sense of English
‘word’, several expressions are possible in that sense. They are:
(5)dǝdema
nuloiap
ties
nǝp(also ‘expression’, ‘utterance’, ‘behaviour, act’)
(nominalisation from verb class IIb -lo ‘speak’)
(also ‘language’, ‘utterance’; also used as verb class I ‘speak’)
(‘part, piece’, also ‘behaviour, act’ and other senses)Of these, the first three tend to be used of lexical items, while nǝp can be used
of smaller parts as well. Two further items may be mentioned, which are used
for ‘meaning’: muana, normally ‘reason’, and kudo (the latter only mentioned
once by one speaker).","[167, 168]"
"Both the above are by the same speaker, in the same narrative. The following
example, by a different speaker, contains a question-word question with a
similar contour to the previous two examples, as well as a yes/no question.
Yes/no questions have a very distinctive sharp pitch rise on the last syllable (or,
when present, on a final particle a which can be added when a positive answer
is expected). The example is from a story of a man who finds an unknown boy
at his homestead and tries to find out who he is:
(96)“Nunuo mani tuaŋ?
Nunuo poi
tuaŋ?”
2s
what 1s.PossII.3m
2s
child 1s.PossII.3m
‘“What are you of mine? Are you my son?”’121TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTFigure 13: Question-word question and yes/no question intonation (male
speaker: SS).","[143, 144]"
"5TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTParts of the verbal system show a future vs. non-future distinction (see also
1.1.8.3 below). Some stems in verb classes II and III have stem alternations and
/ or stress shift for future; subject markers in the first and second person singular and third masculine singular change their vowel from /u/ to /a/; and the subject suffixes of verb class IIa also have different forms for future. Some forms
may thus be severally marked, while others are not marked at all, depending on
the particular combination of stem and affixes.
One of four non-pronominal prefixes can replace object prefixes in the pre-verbal slot, causing the verb to be syntactically intransitive. They are te- ‘reflexive’, ne- ‘reciprocal’, u- ‘dummy object’ and da- ‘pluractional’. Reflexive is
exemplified in (4) with class IIa -bulǝ ‘cut’ and reciprocal in (5) with IIa
-nǝm(u) ‘kill, injure’:
(4)te-u-bulǝ
refl-3mS-cut
‘he cut himself’(5)ne-me-nǝm
rec-3pS-kill/injure
‘they killed each other’The reflexive has an interesting use as an impersonal form (which may be regarded as an incipient passive). This is available with future reference only, so
that saying that ‘the clothes will wash themselves’ means that the clothes are to
be washed, sometimes with an implication that someone present ought to do
something about it. There is no possibility of adding an agent phrase. In the
non-future, third person plural is used in impersonal senses: e.g., ‘they carried
me’ translates as ‘I was born’.
The ‘dummy object’ u- is thus called because it fills the preverbal object slot of
a transitive stem when it is used in an intransitive construction. The stem is still
semantically transitive, but is rendered syntactically intransitive in a particular
instance of use. As mentioned above, u- is used in the nominalisation of transitive stems. It is also used when a non-specific object is expressed as an oblique,
marked by an inalienable possessive (PossI) rather than cross-referenced. This
is shown in (6) a., contrasted with b. which has the full core argument crossreferencing (cf. 1.1.8 below on core vs. oblique arguments):
(6)a. me-la=r
mǝn u-pit=meŋ
ma
lǝp
3pS-go=ASP CONT dummy.O-cut.firewood=3pS 3p.PossI firewood.nsg
‘they went (and) cut firewood’; ‘they went firewood-cutting’
b. me-la ma-pit=meŋ
lǝp
3pS-go 3pO-cut.firewood=3pS firewood.nsg
‘they went (and) cut (the) firewood’The ‘pluractional’ da- is somewhat less common. It indicates plurality associated with the action in some way. For instance, of a dog that bites a lot (7) can
be used, and we also find it in the occasional nominalisation, such as the one in
(8), which is based on -nǝm(u) ‘kill, injure’:6INTRODUCTION: GRAMMATICAL OVERVIEW

da-karǝt=oŋ
3mS-HAB PLURACT-bite=3mS
‘that dog bites a lot’(8)danunǝmiap
‘fighting, traditional warfare’[i-sik
3m-DEMkapuna]
dog(m)1.1.2.2 The verb phrase
In the verb phrase, only the head is obligatory. Other elements as applicable occur in the following order: the first element is the periphrastic future marker
e(ba), followed by auxiliary verbs or particles, then serial verbs and last the
head.
Auxiliaries encode mood and aspect senses such as habitual (particle buat, verb
class II -me) and ‘want; be about to’ (particle nǝmo and verb class II -ga), while
serial verbs are limited to ‘go’ and ‘come’ (-la ‘go’, mu-o and -op ‘come’).
There is further a particle mǝn giving continuous (progressive) aspect which can
occur either before or after auxiliaries and serial verbs and appears to be fairly
new to the system. We also find an aspect enclitic =rǝ (/=arǝ/=r) which attaches to the first constituent of the phrase (unless that constituent is mǝn, in
which case it attaches to the following constituent). The functions of this aspect
marker include perfect-like and completive-like uses, but it is difficult to characterise fully and to label, as it has weak semantics and interacts with predicate
semantics. It is therefore simply glossed as ‘ASPect’ here. (The same slot is used
by adverbial enclitics; cf. 1.1.6 below.)
The only syntactic difference between verbs and adjectives is that future is
marked periphrastically twice for adjectives, with e(ba) as for verbs, and with
an additional ba following the head. In this, adjectives are like other non-verbal
predicates.
Non-verbal predicates can be of a variety of word classes, and only a couple
will be illustrated here. Among nouns, some take class I verbal morphology
when used as predicates, and a handful take the same first and second person
marking as adjectives. The majority, however, are not morphologically marked
for predicate function. Aspect and tense marking function as in other predicate
phrases. Future marking has the extra ba after the head. The following example
illustrates a noun phrase (consisting of a single noun) in predicate function with
future marking:
(9)Eba afǝrǝt ba.
FUT rain
FUT2
‘(there) will be rain.’1.1.3
Possessives
There are two full sets of possessive markers indexing possessor for all 12 person/number/gender categories. The first, PossI, is for inalienable possession,
which in Kuot entails body parts and all other part–whole relations (but not
kin). PossI also has a variety of other functions, marking e.g. material and instrument and a general associative (much like compounds in Germanic lan-7TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTguages), as well as some types of oblique objects. The same set of forms has
grammaticalised as object prefixes on verbs.
The alienable possessives (PossII) index both possessor and possessee (only
third person referents can be possessed). PossII is used for alienable ownership
and kin, and also has some benefactive uses. These forms are of more recent
origin than PossI, and appear to have been formed from the latter plus other
person-marking material present in the language. The PossII set is most likely
the source of the subject enclitics of verb class I.
PossI and PossII employ the same construction:
POSSESSEE MARKER POSSESSORSince the markers index possessor, they can also be used as possessive pronouns (giving the structure POSSESSEE MARKER), and this is the default for first
and second person. The choice between PossI and PossII is semantic, in the
sense that the same noun can take either coding depending on whether it is a
part of something or alienably possessed, in a given instance:
(10)pupu a
meat 3m.PossI
‘pork’kumurot
pig(m)(11)pupu aŋ
Abraham
meat 3m.PossII.s A.
‘Abraham’s (piece of) meat’There are also special interrogative forms (‘whose’), agreeing with the possessed in number and gender. No nouns are obligatorily possessed.5 The forms are
given in Appendix I.
1.1.4
Prepositions
Kuot has ten prepositions. Two have no indexing affixes and differ syntactically
from the rest: ga ‘and’, which can be used in the sense ‘with’, and onim which
indicates origin in space or time. The rest index a following noun by affixes expressing number, gender and person; some do so obligatorily, others optionally.
If the referent is pronominal, it is expressed as an affix:
(12)to-buo
1s-on
‘on me’*bo turuo
on 1sIf a nominal following a preposition is relativised, the preposition is always indexed for that nominal (unless it is ga or onim), here dram (f):
5 An alienable – inalienable distinction in possessives is associated with Austronesian-speaking areas of Papua New Guinea, and it is possible that Kuot has been influenced
by contact in this respect. However, the distinction in neighbouring languages is quite
different: in Nalik and Madak, inalienable possession encodes both kin and body parts,
and at least some inalienably possessed nouns appear to be obligatorily possessed. The
structure of the morphological expression of the two categories is also different in
those languages.","[26, 27, 28, 29]"

This thesis describes certain areas in the grammar of the little-known Kuot
language, spoken by some 1,500 people in New Ireland Province in Papua New
Guinea. Kuot is an isolate, and is the only non-Austronesian (Papuan) language
of that province. The analyses presented here are based on original data from 18
months of linguistic fieldwork.
The first chapter provides an overview of Kuot grammar, and gives details of
earlier mentions of the language, and of data collection and the fieldwork situation. The second chapter presents information about the prehistory and history
of the area, the social system, kinship system and culture of Kuot speakers, as
well as dialectal variation and prognosis of survival of the language. Chapter
three treats Kuot phonology, with particular emphasis on the factors that govern
allophonic variation, and on the expression of word stress and the functions of
intonation. Word classes and the criteria used to define them are presented in
Chapter four, which also contains a discussion of types of morphemes in Kuot.
The last chapter describes in some detail the class of nouns in Kuot, their
declensions, non-singular formation, and the properties of grammatical gender.
Appendices give the full set of person-marking forms in Kuot, a transcription of
a recorded text with interlinear glossing and translation, the Swadesh 100-word
list for Kuot, and diagrams of kin relations and terminology.iiiCONTENTS

"Part of his definition of intonation is
… Intonation is used for a variety of purposes: for marking grammatical boundaries (phrases and clauses), for signalling sentence types (e.g., statements and
questions), and for conveying the speaker’s attitude (surprise, irony, anger, etc.).",[144]
"2INTRODUCTION: GRAMMATICAL OVERVIEWforms for ‘we’ depending on whether the addressee is included or not). The
forms for first and second person are recognisable across the system, while third
person forms vary a lot; this is particularly true of the singular forms. (All pronominal forms are given in Appendix I.)
There are independent personal pronouns only in the first and second person.
In the third person, (complex) demonstratives are used in pronominal functions.
Demonstratives are of two types: simple and complex. There are only four
simple forms: Singular masculine (i), singular feminine (u), dual (li) and plural
(mi). There is no proximity distinction in these forms, which mostly occur together with complex demonstratives. They also function as prefixes within
complex demonstrative forms.
Among complex demonstratives there are two types of stems: locationals/directionals (see 1.1.5 below), and some stems which are bound and are only
used within the demonstrative paradigm (e.g. -sik ‘DEM’). All demonstratives
can be used anaphorically, and some are used only in this way and never exophorically (i.e., for deixis in physical space). Person prefixation is obligatory
when these forms are used as demonstratives. Demonstratives can be determiners or heads of noun phrases, and are often used also with new referents (similar
to the first-mention use of ‘this’ in English).
In the noun phrase, demonstratives and cardinal numerals precede a noun head
(in that order), while attribute construction and relative clauses follow. Ordinal
numerals may precede or follow the head. There are also two particles with
complex functions related to the specificity of a referent: non and ba. The attribute construction here refers to a particular way of expressing attributes,
marked by the relator lǝ prefixed with the same third person prefixes that are
used on demonstratives, followed by the attributive expression. The construction is common with predicates such as verbs or adjectives (and is in fact the
only way of having an attributive adjective), but can also be used with nouns,
quantifiers, or entire clauses. (1) shows an adjective in the attribute construction

Predicates and verb phrases
This section deals with verbs and adjectives, and the structure of the verb
phrase.
1.1.2.1 Verbs and adjectives
A salient feature of Kuot verbs is the the differential ordering of cross-referencing affixes and clitics on verbs, which is lexically governed as has no synchronic function. Different verb stems require subject affixes or enclitics and
object affixes to appear in different orders, producing three intransitive classes
(I, II and III), paired with four transitive classes (I, IIa, IIb and III). Many stems
can be either transitive or intransitive; among these ambitransitives there are3TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTboth S=O and S=A types in all verb classes (i.e., those where the subject of the
intransitive corresponds to the object of the transitive, as with pak ‘break’ (class
I), and those where the subject of the intransitive corresponds to the subject
when an object is added, such as uan-lǝ ‘wait’ (class III)).
Class I has subject enclitics and object prefixes. Class II has subject prefixes,
but is split in the transitive; in IIa, third person objects are suffixes, and nonthird person objects are prefixes; in IIb all objects are prefixes. Class III has
subject “infixes” and object prefixes.3 In adjectives, third person is marked by
suffixes alone, while in the first and second person the subject is marked by prefixes. With first/second person prefixes, the suffixes still are retained, now

The object prefixes have evolved out of the set of forms that mark inalienable

compounding or similar in the past. The subject affixes are identical to those of class II
and have the same morpho-phonological interactions with the second part of the stem,
and it seems likely that class III is historically derived from class II.","[23, 24, 25]"
"(A pause of 0.9 seconds has been cut out between the first and the second
graph, and one of 0.05 between the second and the third.) It is interesting to
note the “downstep” over the sequence of clauses, where from the middle of the
first graph each clause maintains a fairly constant pitch; i.e., there is no declination within the intonation unit, but each has a somewhat lower mean frequency
than the previous one, separated by pitch peaks.
The following example illustrates both fronting and negation. The first word,
the name Samǝtmǝrun, has been topicalised, and there is a clear pitch peak on
the last syllable. As for the negated clause following, it has a dip on the next to
last syllable, followed by a rise on the last syllable – this is the characteristic
pattern for negated clauses. The negator is tǝle, the most general negator in
Kuot, but note that the intonation contour is not associated with the negator but
with the negated clause as a whole:

"Each category can be seen as a prototype in the sense of a bundle of features
that makes up the canonical instance, allowing for typical and less typical
members. If several prototypes are lined up next to each other, morphemes can
be expected to cluster around the canonical points, but items that have only a
few features of a type, or features belonging to more than one type, can be
ranged in between.
Table 2 gives all Kuot grammatical morphemes, (except for those treated
among stems), and interjections, conjunctions and the demonstrative stem augment), ranged from the most cohesive and dependent to the most independent.
The criteria used are
• phonological integration with other material, and
• distribution (selectivity), in terms of what considerations govern the

for clitic positionTo examine the forms, and the criteria for their positions in the table, each morpheme or group of morphemes will be discussed briefly. In particular, we are
141TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTconcerned with the forms which are transitional between the categories affix,
clitic and particle.
1. At the very top we have something which is no longer a productive morpheme, giving future forms of some stems in verb classes II and III. Since this
former suffix is fossilised and not productive, it does not really have a rightful
position among the affixes of the language. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note
that it shares processes with one of the productive morphemes in a different part
of the grammar, namely 2. below: the non-singular suffix on nouns. The shared
process is the conditioning of the allophone [r] from the stem-final /t/ of the
stem to which the suffix adheres. The future forms also have final [n] going to
[l] in the future forms; this is found with the non-singular forms of nouns too,
but less consistently (see 3.2.2.4 and Chapter 5).
2. Apart from the processes shared with 1. above, noun non-singular forms have
a labialisation harmony process whereby the vowel of the non-singular suffix
becomes /u/ (rather than /i/) following a labial consonant (/p/, /f/, /m/) or a
closed syllable containing a rounded vowel (/u/ or /o/). This process is unique to
the non-singular morpheme (see 3.3.4; 5.2.1). Nouns in the special declensions
almost always have the last part of the stem subtracted before the non-singular
ending is added. Although non-singular forms consistently end in /p/, there is
quite a lot of irregularity and unpredictability in the non-singular formation of
nouns.
3. Subject markers are prefixes in verb class II and “infixes” in verb class III
which has bipartite stems with the subject affixes in the middle. They are tightly
integrated with the stem, and have several processes of morpho-phonological
interaction with vowel-initial stems (in verb class III this concerns the second
part of the stem; see 3.3.3 for details of the processes). The affixes are obligatory: stems of II and III cannot appear without the subject slot filled (even in
nominalised forms).
4. The third person singular suffixes on adjectives interact phonologically with
stems ending in /ǝ/ (or in one case /a/; see 3.3.3). The suffixes are obligatory
(but replace non-predictable single vowels when the nominalisation suffix is
added).
5. The third person object markers in verb class IIa are suffixes, with different
forms for future and non-future (cf. 10.). The feminine singular non-future suffix -o is deleted after a stem-final /u/ (e.g. i-alu-o ‘3fS-cover-3fO – she covers
it’ [jalu]).
6. Many adjectives allow a derivation to verb class I, with a causative sense
(e.g. ‘make heavy’). The derived stems usually have a suffix -ra.
7. The pronominal indexing affixes used with prepositions are listed together, in
spite of there being quite a lot of variation between the different prepositions. In
particular, some prepositions are obligatorily indexed in all contexts, while for
others indexing is triggered by certain syntactic contexts.","[162, 163, 164]"

Adverbs
Semantics: Specify place, time, degree, value, or manner of the action or situation described in the predicate; also sentence adverbs such as ‘perhaps’ and
‘again’.
Morphology: Very limited reduplication. (Possibly obsolete -t was used to derive adverbs from other classes).
Syntax: Preferred position after first constituent of clause or phrase, but relatively free. Time adverbs in particular are often topicalised.
Sub-classes: Only as indicated by semantics; a few forms can take class I verbal
morphology.
Size: 44.

Numerals
Semantics: Numbers 1–10.
Morphology: ‘10’ takes dual and non-singular suffixes in the formation of
higher numbers.
Syntax: Prenominal.
Numbers from 3 and up are construed with the inalienable possessive markers
(‘four “of” pigs’).
Numbers over 10 are formed from the lower numbers (e.g. ‘six “of” tens and
four’ is 64, ‘ten “of” tens’ is 100).

Personal pronouns
Semantics: Emphatic or contrastive reference to speech-act participants (no
pronouns for third person).
Morphology: None.
Syntax: Normally constitute NP, sometimes in appositive constructions. Cannot
form complements of most prepositions (the prepositions take indexing affixes
instead). Rarely if ever in subject or object function; typically topicalised.
Sub-classes: None.

Morphology: PossI forms index possessor in 12 categories. PossII forms index
possessor as well as possessee, some making a gender distinction in the third
person singular, giving 42 forms. There are also four interrogative forms. The
forms as such are invariant.
Syntax: In the possessive phrase, the possessee noun phrase comes first, followed by the possessive marker, followed by the possessor noun phrase. The
noun phrases are not otherwise marked. The marker functions pronominally if
there is no possessor noun phrase (this is the main strategy for first and second
person possessors).
Sub-classes: PossI, PossII, interrogative.
Size: 58 forms.
4.1.8
Prepositions
Semantics: Typically indicate location, goal, or function (oblique argument
role) of referents (which are usually coded in noun phrases).
Morphology: For all but two prepositions, person/number/gender affixes index
the referent, always for some; for others obligatorily in some syntactic contexts
and for first and second person, and optionally elsewhere.
Syntax: Precede the noun phrase, forming a prepositional phrase. Me ‘to, for’
can combine with other prepositions.
Sub-classes: Indexing vs. non-indexing.

Locationals and directionals
Semantics: Encode location, proximity, or direction of an event or situation

"15TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT30 languages). Others have proposed various explanations for these tendencies.12
On another approach we may look at Kuot in terms of headedness, where a less
consistent picture emerges. While the clause is left-headed, the noun phrase has
the head (normally the noun) in the middle somewhere to the right, and predicate phrases have the head (normally the verb) as the last constituent.
Kuot is similarly split if we look at head–dependent marking (roughly following
Nichols (1986)). Kuot is head-marking on the clause level, i.e., grammatical
roles are indicated by cross-referencing affixes on the verb for up to two arguments (word order too indicates grammatical role where two argument noun
phrases are present), and there is no case marking. Within a noun phrase, on the
other hand, it is the dependents of the noun that are marked for agreement, and
in the singular, gender is marked on dependents only and not on the noun (while
non-singular number is explicitly marked on the noun as well as on dependents). As prepositions often agree with the following noun, prepositional
phrases would have to be seen as head-marking as well. Relativisation is unmarked in this respect.
1.3
Language name and previous sources
It appears that most of the language names in New Ireland were applied by the
Australian administration some time in the 1940’s or later. In 1962, Capell
wrote:
“There is much confusion in the naming of languages in the northern half of
New Ireland. In earlier periods, village names were generally used, e.g., Lugagun. In recent years the custom has grown up and has been followed in Australian Government circles of using a word which means ‘my child’ as a language
name, so that Lugagun becomes Natik [sic!] and Kanalu becomes Barok.”
(Capell 1962a: 101) [“Natik” here should be “Nalik”.]Most of the early administration records were destroyed by the Japanese during
the second world war, but from 1945–1975 there are reports from government
officers in the Australian administration, who carried out yearly or twice-yearly
patrols through the territory (see 2.3). I have not come across any information
as to the origins of the naming practice, although similar practices were used to
name languages in Australia. Any official comments on the topic in documents
of the administration for the Mandated territory of New Guinea are likely to
have been destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Rabaul during the War
in the Pacific (WWII).
There was clearly no principle of language naming before 1930. Both Chinnery
([1930?]) and Powdermaker (1971 [1933]), carried out their respective fieldwork in 1929 (in Powdermaker’s case until 1930), and neither makes any mention of such a principle, but continue using village names. Powdermaker even

Principles of glossing
In this book, a phonemic system is used, with neither phonological nor morphophonological processes applied.
Each example that gives stretches longer than a single word has three lines: the
Kuot data line; a morpheme-by-morpheme translation of the Kuot in the interlinear gloss line, and the free translation line. Free translations are aimed at
giving as exact as possible an idea of the meaning of the entire utterance.
Sometimes this means that the words used in the interlinear gloss are not the
same as those used in the translation; for example if a lexeme kup´lip meaning
‘dry leaves from cooking’ is used in the gloss it may be judged that ‘rubbish’ is
the equivalent sense in the particular context, and ‘rubbish’ will be used in the
free translation.
Everywhere in this work, Kuot words, morphemes and sentences are given in
italics, as are occasional words from other languages in the area. English
translations are given in single quotes (‘ ’), and it was decided to give Tok Pisin
words in the same way.
Most of the data reproduced in examples are from texts. Capitalisation, commas
and stops are used to indicate intonational units as follows:
• A capitalised initial letter indicates the beginning of a sentence (and also
proper names)
• A comma (,) indicates the end of an intonation unit with a continuation
(rising) contour
• A stop (.) indicates the end of an intonation unit with final (falling) contourxABBREVIATIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF GLOSSINGStops, hyphens and equal signs indicate different types of morph and morpheme
boundaries. The graphic distance they create is iconic to the degree of
integration of the morphemes thus combined. Stops (.) only occur in the interlinear gloss in this function, as it is used to separate the two glosses belonging
to an indivisible morph, and also to connect the words of a multi-word gloss
(e.g. ‘coconut.palm’ and ‘get.up’). A hyphen (-) indicates an affix boundary,
while an equal sign (=) indicates a clitic boundary. For some morphemes, apparent inconsistencies result from irregularities in the language; for instance the
non-singular morpheme on nouns (‘nsg’) is sometimes given in the gloss with a
stop and sometimes with a hyphen. This is because although the plural form
always ends in -p, segmenting it off the non-singular form often does not leave
an acceptable form of the lexeme. Compare:
(1)singular
kit
kiban
kikinǝmgloss
fire
leg
earnon-singular gloss
kit-ip
fire-nsg
kibǝp
leg.nsg
kikip
ear.nsgAffix and clitic boundaries are marked on the line giving the Kuot data as well,
and it should be noted that it is represented without phonological and morphological processes applied. For example, kit in (1) is pronounced [kit], but kit-ip
is pronounced [kirip].
Forward slashes are sometimes used in glosses and occasionally in translations
to indicate alternative translation possibilities for a morpheme (e.g. -on´ma
sit/live/stay) or a phrase.
Angle brackets (< >) are used on all three lines to indicate hesitation and repair.
If empty, it means that there is an unfilled hesitation pause. If there is a repair
sequence it is given within the angle brackets (and glossed). In yet other cases
the repaired sequence has been omitted in the interest of space or to make the
example easier to follow; this is represented as <…>.
Square brackets ([ ]) and regular brackets (( )) are used in translations in the
following way: Square brackets indicate words which are part of the Kuot data
given, but which are very unidiomatic in English, as in the use of demonstratives together with possessives, which will give translations such as ‘[this] his
brother’. Regular brackets indicate words in the English translation which are
required by the grammar of English, but which are not present in the Kuot data
given. In some cases this is done also where the English is very much more
specific than the Kuot, in particular for the relator l´, which is in itself very
vague in meaning. It is simply glossed RELR, but for instance in its clause
joining function it may have one of several meanings such as ‘when’ and ‘because’; when introducing relative clauses it can mean ‘who’, ‘which’ and so
forth. Any such English word in the translation is given in regular brackets to
indicate that that meaning is not part of the Kuot data – or at any rate not with
that degree of specificity.
The covert category of gender is given for a noun ((m) or (f)) only where another constituent shows agreement with it.xiPREFACE
The title on the cover of this dissertation, Topics in the grammar of Kuot, is designed to allow for a less than unitary collection of subjects within. It makes it
possible to shamelessly lump together such diverse topics as phonology, kinship, and nouns in the same volume, as long as they pertain to the Kuot language, or its speakers. The background to this is that the original PhD project
was a full descriptive grammar of Kuot. Somehow the draft manuscript kept
growing and growing, but the end of the project remained elusively at a constant distance of “about six months”, while evermore pages were being added.
When graduation was long overdue, all respectable funding possibilities had
been exhausted for over a year, and exciting linguistic projects requiring a PhD
appeared on the horizon, my supervisors Kari and Östen stepped in. They
wisely suggested that I present some sections of the work for the degree, so that
I could move on to greener linguistic pastures while continuing to revise additional chapters with a view to eventually publishing the full grammar.
Two main criteria were used to select the chapters to go into the dissertation:
autonomy and overview. The socio-cultural chapter and the chapters about
nouns and phonology were judged to be relatively free from cross-reference to
chapters omitted in this version. To compensate in some degree for missing
chapters, overviews of Kuot grammar are provided in the introduction and word
classes chapters.
There are many people without whom I could never had carried out this work.
First of all, it would not have happened at all if Bob Dixon and Sasha Aikhenvald had not invited me to Australia to do linguistic fieldwork. Their Research
Centre for Linguistic Typology not only provided an enormously stimulating
working environment, but also paid for fieldwork expenses (even from Australia, the cost of airfares to Papua New Guinea is excruciating). Bob has read and
commented on all drafts, some of them in several versions, and by appointment
undertook the boring but sadly necessary task of nagging me about overdue
chapters. Both Bob and Sasha were always supportive and happy to discuss any
matter linguistic, and I feel that being able to share their extensive experience
and that of other members of the centre has contributed a lot to my development
as a linguist and a member of the linguistic community.
The Linguistics department in Stockholm let me make a radical change of topic
and move to a different hemisphere for years without severing my affiliation or,
even more amazing, discontinuing my salaried graduate position. Not only that,
but my primary supervisor Kari Fraurud carefully read drafts posted, faxed or
emailed from remote places throughout the entire period, even when she took
up a job outside Stockholm University. She always sent back lots of useful and
well-considered feedback, and her enthusiasm and belief in my ability to carry
out this project never wavered.","[11, 12, 13, 14]"
"135TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTfollowing sections will deal first with stems, and then show how affixes, clitics
and particles form a continuum, rather than discrete categories. The possessives
are discussed last.
Sometimes in the following, the same information will be given several times.
This is because of items such as verb class II stems and their obligatory subject
prefixes, which to some extent define each other in being mutually dependent as
morphological forms. These relations will be investigated first from the point of
view of stems, then from the point of view of affixes etc., at the risk of being
somewhat repetitive.
4.2.1
Stems
The term “stem” is used loosely here for a morpheme in Kuot that
• is part of a paradigm (or form-class), and
• can be used on its own or be host to affixes or clitics.
Kuot has four word classes which can be called lexical on account of the meanings they encode: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. As said above, only two
are open, namely nouns and verb class I. Further stems are the sets of locationals, demonstratives, prepositions, numerals, and pronouns.
The stems differ, as types of morphemes, in two ways that concern us here: in
the amount of variation in form that they display in different contexts, and in
their degree of morphological autonomy. By variance is meant the degree to
which the stem type occurs in the same phonological form in all contexts where
it appears. Autonomy is whether the stems are bound (–) or are able to appear
without the presence of associated morphology (+). Table 1 lists the stem types
and their properties as regards variance and autonomy (the properties given for
each category hold for the majority of members in a class, but not necessarily
all).","[157, 158]"
"1284WORD CLASSES
AND OVERVIEW OF
MORPHOLOGYThis chapter has three parts. The first summarises the characteristics of each
word class (form class) identified for Kuot, in terms of semantics, morphology
and syntax, with mention of sub-classes where appropriate, and the approximate
size of the class for closed classes.1 The second part of the chapter is an overview of the morphology, discussing stems, affixes, clitics, and particles, their
prototypical definitions for Kuot, and cases that do not fit the definitions. Properties of cohesion, form variance and distribution are discussed. The last part
concerns the unit “word” in Kuot.
The terms “agreement”, “indexing” and “cross-referencing” refer to the same
categories in terms of person, gender and number marking in the grammar, but
with the following differences: agreement is used for relations within the noun
phrase, so that for instance a demonstrative in attribute use agrees with a head
noun; indexing is used for cases where the item showing the category is not
syntactically within the scope of the noun, as for prepositions and possessives,
which thus index the category of the noun (as well as referents not expressed as
nouns); cross-referencing is used for the pronominal markers on a predicate
(verb or adjective) which cross-reference a noun (or referent not expressed as a
noun) in an argument role.
4.1
Word classes
There are only two open classes in Kuot: nouns and verb class I. All other
classes are closed. Four classes can be identified as lexical: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. These are presented first, followed by: numerals, pronouns,
possessives, prepositions, locationals and directionals, and demonstratives. The
1 Numbers for the closed word classes represent the numbers of stems in my data. I amcertain that there are more members than I have been able to collect, in particular in
the larger of the classes (verb classes II and III, adjectives, and perhaps also adverbs),
as it proved impossible to elicit lexemes according to morphological patterning. A
further complication in giving numbers for verbs is that some stems are “semiambitransitive”, so that relations between transitive and intransitive variants are not
straightforward in terms of semantics and/or form, making it somewhat arbitrary
whether one or two stems should be counted.","[150, 151]"
"TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTlast subsection is shared by several small classes: particles, adverbial and aspectual enclitics, conjunctions, and interjections.
This section summarises the criteria on which the classes and sub-classes are
based. More information about the behaviour of particular groups of morphemes is given in 4.2 below; a detailed description of nouns is found in Chapter 5; other classes are briefly described and exemplified in 1.1.
4.1.1
Nouns
Semantics: Prototypically denote entities in the world; also abstract concepts.
Morphology: Inherent gender (masculine and feminine) in the singular (reflected in agreement, indexing and cross-referencing morphology on other constituents within and outside the noun phrase). The semantics of gender is
opaque for inanimate referents.
Inflect for non-singular and dual number (reflected in the same way as gender).
Much irregularity in the non-singular (plural) formation; dual mostly regular
(based on non-singular). Deviant dual and plural formation for many kin terms
in reference to pairings/groupings denoted by the term, in contrast to regular
forms.
One “plain” and ten “special” declensions based on singular form; in the special
declensions the last part of the stem is in most cases subtracted before the nonsingular suffix is added.
Many nouns (but not all) can also function as stems in verb class I, without
morphological derivation.
There is no productive reduplication among nouns.
Syntax: Typically head of the noun phrase (also limited appositional use). The
gender/number category of the noun governs agreement within the noun phrase,
person indexing in possessives and on prepositions, and the form of cross-referencing morphemes on verbs and adjectives.
Sub-classes: Declensions (see morphology just above).
Inherently locative nouns (do not take locative preposition na ‘in, at’).
Relational nouns (‘behind’, ‘in the middle (of)’ etc.; can only be used in relation
to an entity, never for parts (*‘back’)), construed with inalienable possessive
forms.
Three quantifiers: pǝppot and pǝppauliap, both meaning ‘much, many’, and
namarip ‘few’.
One filler noun used when searching for a lexeme has separate feminine and
masculine forms (m. marǝ, f. maro), as well as a special form for place names
(marǝn), and a few terms for pigs of particular colouring also have gendered
forms.
4.1.2
Verbs
Semantics: Prototypically denote actions and states.
130WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: WORD CLASSESMorphology: Take affixes and enclitics cross-referencing one to two arguments.
Stems are monotransitive, ambitransitive (S=A or S=O: a few stems can be either) or transitive. A few stems in class II are suppletive between intransitive
and transitive; sometimes part of one paradigm is suppletive.
The order of cross-referencing affixes and clitics in relation to the stem give
three classes (I, II and III) in the intransitive, which are paired with four classes
(I, IIa, IIb and III) in the transitive. There is also a handful of irregular verbs
that do not fit into the classes.
Some stems in classes II and III have stem changes for future.
A dummy object marker u- or the pluractional da- in the object prefix slot renders the stem syntactically intransitive, as do the prefixes te- ‘REFLexive’ and
ne- ‘RECiprocal’.
Action nominalisation is a morphological process in verb classes II and III;
stems in verb class I are used as nouns without morphological derivation.
There is some productive reduplication in verb class I.
Syntax: Typically head of the verb phrase; can also occur in the attribute construction.
Sub-classes: Classes I, II (a, b) and III, based on argument cross-referencers
(see Morphology above).
There are three auxiliary verbs (habitual -me, -ga ‘want; be about to’, and -ma
‘try’; see also particles).
There are three verbs that serialise with other verbs (-la ‘go’, mu-o ‘come’ and
-op ‘come’).
Size: Verb class I is open. Verb class II is closed and has 110 members; verb
class III is also closed and has 71 members.
4.1.3
Adjectives
Semantics: Typically denote states, qualities or properties.
Morphology: Take subject cross-referencing affixes; some irregularity.
Action nominalisation by derivational suffix.
Opaque and unpredictable reduplication patterns.
Causative through derivation, then used as verb (class I).
Syntax: As for verbs, but future marking with an extra ba (as for other nonverbal predicates).
Sub-classes: (interrogative lak- ‘be where’ is blocked from the attribute construction).
Size: 76 (closed).","[151, 152, 153]"
"80KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: LANGUAGE HEALTHthat will occur in all languages, especially given the big changes to life style
that have occurred over the last century. For example, the village has moved
from the mountains to the coast, gardens are prepared using bush knives rather
than stone axes and shell knives, and the main crop is sweet potato rather than
taro. It is not surprising that younger people would not know specialised terminology for preparing a taro garden in the old way, etc. However, everyone in
this region is also fully fluent in Tok Pisin, and this intermediary generation
does mix a lot of Tok Pisin lexemes into their Kuot (and probably even more
when the visiting linguist is not listening).
In the next age group down, among people of around 18 or 20 years of age, we
find a reduced form of the language. These people understand Kuot without
trouble, but do not speak it often themselves; when they do, it is usually primarily in order not to be understood by speakers of Austronesian languages. I was
not able to study this variety in detail, but, there is a tendency to regularise
forms and to use the productive verb class (class I) over other verb classes and
adjectives. Occasionally other stems are regularised into class I; for instance the
adjective marakkes- ‘stinging, smarting’ is used as a class I verb. There is also
reduction of the lexicon on the pattern of Tok Pisin. As is typical of pidgins and
creoles, Tok Pisin does not have a very large lexicon, and often several senses
achieved by different lexemes in old languages are subsumed under one lexeme
in the creole. Semi-speakers transfer this simpler lexical structure to Kuot. For
example, I was told that people of this age typically use one and the same lexeme, class I isin, for both ‘search for’ and ‘find’, following Tok Pisin ‘painim’,
whereas Kuot generally has isin for ‘search’ and class II -op for ‘find’.
Children, finally, are in general not learning Kuot. They often have a good passive knowledge and can follow the main content of other people’s conversations, but even in families with two perfectly fluent parents in the 30-year age
group, the parents will speak Tok Pisin with the children. As far as I was able to
make out, this does not reflect any political stance, or idea that Tok Pisin is the
language of the nation or the future or suchlike.
It is interesting to compare this situation with Don Kulick’s (1992) study of language shift in Gapun village in the Sepik province of Papua New Guinea. He
describes cultural conceptions where the vernacular (Taiap) is associated with
the idea of ‘hed’, which is in turn associated with backwardness, lack of education, paganism and irresponsible or selfish behaviour. Tok Pisin on the other
hand is connected with ‘save’, which is associated with modernity, education,
Christianity and responsible and community-oriented behaviour. This only
partly resonates with what I observed among the Kuots. First, although a dichotomy similar to ‘hed’ versus ‘save’ is present in some respects (and there are
similarities such as women being culturally construed as irresponsible and men
as responsible) behaviour is not discussed in those terms. Second, there is presently no association of Tok Pisin with progress, and only a very weak, if any,
association of Kuot with backwardness. One old man of about 60 years asked
me if Tok Pisin was spoken in the world generally and seemed to hope and perhaps believe that that was the case. His children grew up speaking Kuot. His81TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTdaughter was taught in English in school and knows that Tok Pisin is confined
to Papua New Guinea. Yet, her children are growing up speaking Tok Pisin.
Sometimes the argument is put forward that Kuot is too difficult for the children
(this echoes the generally held opinion in the region that Kuot is a very difficult
language; which is presumably because it has gender, cross-references objects
as well as subjects, and has quite extensive agreement morphology, making it
difficult for Austronesian speakers to acquire).
Some children do grow up with Kuot as their first language, for instance in the
small village Okoiok not far from Bimun. As soon as the children are big
enough to come and play in Bimun, around five or six years of age, they acquire
Tok Pisin, and later they go to the local school which has children from both
Madak and Kuot villages, and by then Tok Pisin is established as perhaps their
strongest language, and definitely the one used in most interactions outside the
family. (In the particular case of Okoiok, children are encouraged to keep
speaking Kuot by a man who is in favour of the language surviving, and who, I
am told, will chase the children with the cane if he hears them speaking Tok
Pisin. That such measures are seen as necessary also says something about the
chances this language has of surviving.)
In Bimun, my main informant Robert Sipa started making his two sons speak
Kuot after working with me for a while. They were around three and five years
old, and could speak it after about a year. They speak it with their parents, but
of course Tok Pisin is the language used amongst the children in general.
Unfortunately, efforts towards language preservation are the exception rather
than the rule (although one would wish they did not involve the cane). One
main reason is the lack of identifying, or emblematic, function of the language;
the village and clan being the more important units. Most people are simply not
concerned about the language; others sometimes express concern but no very
viable initiatives have so far emerged. Further, the loss of many traditional
contexts of language use surely plays a role; for example there are no feasts
where oratory skills can be demonstrated; without the men’s houses there is
rarely story telling; and the old songs are not often sung.
Another qualification to the rough picture concerns a gender-based difference,
where it seems that women/girls in the two younger groups are often better at
the language than the men/boys. For some reason it seems that mothers speak
Kuot to their daughters more often than to their sons, and that fathers do not
speak Kuot to their sons or daughters to any noticeable degree. However, mothers tend to speak Kuot to their young daughters primarily when scolding them,
which presumably does not help to give the language positive connotations for
the girl in question.
One positive factor that has come onto the scene in the last few years is the local language preschool, part of a nation-wide programme to give the first two
years of schooling in the local language. Children are meant to learn to read and
write in the vernacular, and then have a bridging year to English as the language
of instruction. The Kuot preschool in Bimun has been in place for a couple of
82KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: ORTHOGRAPHYyears, the teachers being local women who have had a few weeks of training.
The fact that the school is there may have some positive impact on the status of
the language. (However, the orthography is problematic, and the mix of children having Kuot as the first language through to children not knowing it at all
makes it a challenging teaching situation; further, many children do not attend
regularly.)
2.12
Orthography
Most Kuot speakers are literate in the sense of knowing the alphabet and being
able to read and write a little bit, but a newspaper is tough going. Younger people can often read Tok Pisin and English reasonably well, but it is not a writing
culture. Information that you are told by another person is trusted over written
information. Even personal names are often inconsistently spelt.
There is no very consistent orthography widely in use for Kuot. There are a few
publications in Kuot, produced by the bible translators Chul-Hwa and Kyung-Ja
Chung of the Summer Institute for Linguistics together with committees formed
among Kuot speakers. The publications are the afore-mentioned hymnbook, and
two gospels and other portions of the New Testament (Marko ga 1, 2 Timoti
1994) (Bais ula mumuru ang Ioanes, ga 1, 2, 3 Babam ang Ioanes 1996), as
well as some literacy materials. The launch of a full bible translation is imminent at the time of writing.
The Chungs’ orthography writes the central vowel /ǝ/ as ‘a’ (collapsing it with
the phoneme /a/), and is somewhat inconsistent in the spelling of lenited voiceless stops, in particular as regards the variant [V] of /k/, which is written ‘g’;
while /g/ in my analysis is a separate phoneme.
Most speakers have learnt to write through the medium of English, and will use
‘v’ and ‘r’ for the lenited versions of /p/ and /t/ in most positions; sometimes ‘p’
and ‘t’ will be used word-initially even if the word follows after another word
ending in a vowel. [V] on the other hand does not have a symbol in English
(barring ‘g’ which is used for a different sound in the language), and people use
‘k’ to write it. There is no question that people are aware of the phonological
relationship between the stops and their lenited variants, but people are used to
‘v’ and ‘r’ and are not happy with the idea of using ‘p’ and ‘t’ in positions
where these sounds are lenited. Designing a practical orthography that takes
into account both the speakers’ preferences and linguistic generalisations is not
an easy task, and is not one of the aims of the present project.
Another area of inconsistency in native writing is that of affixes and clitics,
where the former are only very rarely separated from their hosts in writing,
whereas clitics may appear attached or unattached and are often inconsistent
even within one text.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"

special declension (ma):

‘2 tears’Noun stems in the plain declension are thus invariant in the sense that the nonsingular is simply added to the stem without modification; and also autonomous
in that they can be used “as is”. In the special declensions, however, there is a
problem with identifying the stem. The constant stem parts in the last two
examples above are *kubu and *ku but since the endings -nǝm and -ma are not
predictable from any general principles, and since the starred forms are not attested as phonological forms, we would not want to postulate them as stems.
These nouns may perhaps be said to have two related stem variants, one singular and one non-singular. The question of stem autonomy in the special declensions depends on the analysis of stem-hood for the singular forms – if an underlying stem like the starred forms were postulated, that underlying stem
137TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTwould of course require morphological processing even to form the singular,
i.e., it would be variable and non-autonomous. If, on the other hand, we accept
singular and plural stem variants, each is autonomous in the sense that it can be
used without such processing, and at least the singular stem would be autonomous. Dual forms are simply suffixed to the end of the non-singular form in
most cases.
Among the verbs, class I stems are largely invariant (apart from a final /a/ or /ǝ/
often being deleted before the third person singular masculine subject enclitic).
There is some reduplication, with effects such as iterative, distributive, duration
and intensity. Class I stems are autonomous in that they are used bare in citation, as action nominals, and in active form following the habitual auxiliary
-me; elsewhere in active use a subject enclitic is obligatory. Stems which are
transitive only require the object slot to be filled by the dummy object prefix uin citation and nominalisation.
Verb classes II and III differ quite markedly from class I. The stems show a fair
amount of morpho-phonological interaction with subject affixes, and some
stems also have alternate forms for future. In class II there are a few suppletive
stems (e.g. -num ‘walk’; -muŋ ‘walk.fut’). There is no reduplication in class II
or in the second part of the stem in class III, but the first part of the stem in class
III is occasionally reduplicated. These stems are not autonomous, but require
the subject affix slot to be filled at all times (in nominalisation, the second person singular affix is used).
Adjectives show morpho-phonological interaction with subject suffixes. There
is reduplication but it is non-productive and irregular, and has no discernible semantic impact. The suffixes that cross-reference third person are obligatory, and
remain as number markers in first and second person forms, which are marked
by prefixes, e.g.:
(2)kak-kan-i
RED-big-3m
‘he/it(m) is big’nu-kak-kan-i
2s-RED-big-sg
‘you(sg) are big’kak-kan-in
RED-big-3d
‘they(2) are big’ma-kak-kan-in
2d-RED-big-dl
‘you(2) are big’A few manner adverbs have reduplication (the semantic impact is not clear).
The forms are autonomous.
Locationals and directionals are invariant, but have certain compounding tendencies, whereby several items can be strung together. A few members in this
class are autonomous, while the majority require prefixation with a small set of
prefixes that have some proximity distinctions, but whose main function appears to be to form viable words. There is also the augment mentioned in 4.1.9
which causes stems to take slightly different affixes.
Demonstratives (4.1.10 above and 1.1.1) are of two types, simple and composite. The simple forms, which may function independently or as prefixes to loca138WORD CLASSES AND OVERVIEW OF MORPHOLOGY: MORPHOLOGYtional/directional forms or demonstrative stems, are invariant. In independent
use they are autonomous. The stems to which they are prefixed to form complex
demonstratives are invariant but all the demonstrative stems (i.e. those which
are not in the paradigm of locational/directionals) are bound and can only occur
prefixed.
Prepositions are invariant, except for bo ‘on’ which has the form buo when it
takes person-indexing prefixes. One further preposition, irǝ- ‘at (etc.)’ has some
phonological interaction with person suffixes. Some prepositions are autonomous while others require person affixes.
Numerals are invariant with the exception of the word for ‘ten’, mǝnaburuan,
which takes non-singular and dual forms in the formation of higher numbers
(nsg: mǝnaburualap, dl: mǝnaburualapien). The forms are autonomous.
Finally, pronouns are also invariable forms, although historically they appear
to be reduplicated forms of the morphemes which cross-reference and index the
same pronominal categories (there are no third person pronouns). They are
autonomous.
4.2.2
Affix – clitic – particle, a dependency cline
We will now turn to non-stems, i.e. affixes, clitics and particles. Kuot
grammatical morphemes show varying degrees of cohesion with or dependency
on other material, ranging from tightly integrated affixes via clitics to particles
that make up independent words. This section will discuss the properties of
each type, as well as some problems that arise in categorising the morphemes.
First, I will propose definitions of prototypical affixes, clitics and particles for
Kuot.
For Kuot, a prototypical affix is defined as a morpheme
 with grammatical meaning
 adhering to particular classes of morphemes (e.g. verb or sub-class of verb)
 forming a close unit with the morpheme to which it adheres (in terms of
being obligatorily selected, not allowing for pausing, often having morphophonological alterations at the boundary, etc.)
For Kuot, a prototypical clitic is defined as a morpheme
 with grammatical or lexical meaning
 adhering to the first constituent in a phrase
For Kuot, a prototypical particle is defined as a morpheme
 with grammatical meaning
 not attaching to another constituent
As will be seen in the following, even these rather minimal definitions cause
conflicts in some cases, and several morphemes straddle the categories. Instead
of discrete categories, it is therefore useful to think of these categorisations as
prototypes along a continuum, or cline, as schematised in Figure 1.","[158, 159, 160, 161]"

‘That man, his mother lived in (another) place.’RELRThere is no formal subordination of clauses in Kuot. With the possible exception of temporal adverbial clauses, all clauses can have aspectual and temporal
marking in the same way. Clauses are conjoined with ga ‘and’, pa ‘but’, lǝ ‘relator (RELR)’, o ‘or’. Temporal adverbial clauses can be coded by the relator lǝ
or the word tǝrǝ ‘time’. Purpose clauses are indicated by the preposition me ‘to,
for’. Prepositions generally require nominal complements (as do possessives),
and would normally have to be followed by nominalisations, but the nominal
restriction can be circumvented with me by using the future marker e(ba),
which allows for the use of a full clause following me:

Relative clauses follow their heads, and are marked with the relator lǝ. Here the
relative clause modifies the possessor (lǝmot ‘python’) in the complex object
noun phrase:

RELR 3mS-put-3fO
‘she found this egg of this python (who) had put (=laid) it.’The relative clause is very similar to two other constructions: topicalisation and
the attribute construction. It differs from topicalisation only in that there is another clause which is interpreted as the main clause, while the relative clause is
understood to modify a nominal constituent.9 The only structural difference between a relative clause and a clause in the attribute construction is that the relator takes person prefixes in the latter function (cf. 1.1.1 above). Semantically,
attributes tend to express properties perceived of as somehow integral to the
referent, while relative clauses tend to be more general in this regard.
Nominals in many types of roles can be relativised: subjects (transitive or intransitive), objects, possessors and obliques marked with possessive markers,
and noun phrases out of prepositional phrases.
1.1.8.2 Questions
Kuot has question words for ‘who’ (aka, noun (m)), ‘what’ (mani, noun (m)),
‘do what’ (-amani, verb (class II)), ‘whose’ (auaŋ etc., possessive), ‘where’ (la9 There are probably intonational clues to the function as relative clause, but these re-main to be investigated.","[33, 34]"
"193TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTIf the assumption is accepted that there would historically have been principles
for the distribution of inanimate nouns in the plain declension into the two genders, we would like to know how the present situation came about. Perhaps the
most likely explanation is semantic drift, whereby nouns gradually take on other
meanings over time. If they retain their gender while changing their meaning, a
semantically opaque gender system would eventually result. Again, it is a problem that Kuot is an isolate, since this means that there are no known related languages whose vocabularies can be studied in order to establish the original
senses of Kuot words.
If we subscribe to the idea that a young gender system is for the most part systematic and rule-governed, and that the systematicity and rules can be obscured
over time by various kinds of drift,39 then gender in Kuot is clearly old. The
opacity seen in Kuot gender could be described as a type of decline of the gender system; not the decline of Corbett (1991: 315ff) or decay of Aikhenvald (in
press), who both refer to the loss of one or more gender categories, but rather
the loss of the systematic aspect of the system as such, that is, the semantic underpinnings on which inanimate gender was based. It is evident that gender as a
grammatical category is alive and well: it is rigorously expressed across all
categories that display concord; the concord morphology is not showing signs
of collapse; and neither gender seems to be expanding at the cost of the other.
The grammatical system is operating; the semantic one is not.
5.7
Sub-classes of nouns
In the above we have looked at the morphological classes of Kuot, and at the
workings of gender. We also saw that many kin terms and other human nouns
form particular dual and non-singular forms. This section introduces a few more
categories of nouns that exhibit particular behaviour in one way or another.
5.7.1
Inherently locative nouns
A few words in Kuot are “inherent locatives”, that is, they do not take the locative preposition na to express location. The inherent locatives include the following nouns, and the relational nouns discussed in 5.7.2:

"199TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT5.7.5
Numerals
It could be argued that numerals be analysed as a sub-class of nouns. Some numerals can be analysed as compounds of the locative preposition na ‘in, at’ with
erstwhile nouns. Numbers from ‘three’ and up are constructed with PossI possessives. The number ‘ten’ takes dual and non-singular to form the numbers
‘twenty’ and higher multiples of ‘ten’. But they are defective as nouns in that
they cannot be used in the attribute construction (thereby differing from the
quantifiers which we saw in the attribute construction in (92)). The numerals
‘one’ and ‘two’ deviate in further ways, and numerals were given a class of
their own, separate from nouns.
5.8
Nouns and other word classes
This section is concerned with the various relations that nouns bear to other
word classes.
5.8.1
Nominalisations: action nominals
There are processes for forming action nominals from predicates, i.e. verbs and
adjectives. Stems of verb class II and III and of adjectives are nominalised
through particular morphology (cf. 1.1.2). Noun stems cannot normally be converted into verbs of classes II or III, or into adjectives (though the first part of
class III stems is sometimes derived from a noun). The relation is normally one
of derivation from verb to noun (e.g. nuloiap ‘words, sound, talking’ from class
IIb -lo/loa ‘make noise, speak’), though in rare cases we do find a noun ie
‘smell’ corresponding to a verb stem -ie ‘smell’ (class IIb).
Class I verb stems are simply used without verbal morphology, and conversely,
many nouns can be used as verbs of class I (which is the other open class in the
language). Not all class I verbs can be used as nouns, and not all nouns can be
used as class I verbs, but for stems which may be used as either, we may talk of
zero derivation; or we may say that the stems are not subcategorised for the
property of verb or noun. This relation is schematised in Figure 2.
nounsverb class IFigure 2: Nouns and verb class I: overlap of stems.","[221, 222]"
"11TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTOnly noun phrases which are coreferent with cross-referencing morphemes can
occur bare in the clause, and are understood to be in a core argument function.
All other roles of noun phrases must be marked by prepositions or possessives.8
Core arguments are thus identified by the presence of cross-referencing and the
absence of prepositions or possessives with any coreferent noun phrases.
The subject of a non-verbal/non-adjectival predicate can be said to have defective subject properties: while it is bare in the clause, there is no possibility of
cross-referencing. Here kuraibun ‘spirit woman’ is predicated of the phrase
u-sik makabun ‘that woman’:
(25)[kuraibun]
[u-sik makabun].
spirit.woman 3f-DEM woman
‘that woman (was) a spirit woman.’A common permutation to clause structure involves topicalisation through
fronting. Either a subject or an object noun phrase may be fronted, but not both.
The construction is marked by the relator (RELR) lǝ, or by ga (otherwise ‘and’),
with no difference in meaning. In the following example, the subject of an intransitive verb has been topicalised:
(26)Samǝtmǝrun lǝ
tǝle [u-me
ubi].
S.
RELR NEG 3mS-HAB work=Ø.
‘Samǝtmǝrun didn’t use to work.’Adverbials, in particular time adverbials, are freqently topicalised too, and may
or may not be marked by lǝ or ga. If both an argument noun phrase and an adverbial are fronted, the adverbial comes first and the argument before the predicate. Here there is a time adverbial and a topicalised object:
(27)Na tǝrǝ tinan, [u-to

RELRPossessees can be topicalised out of possessive constructions too. In the following example, the topicalisation and marking with the relator creates a copulative construction from the otherwise similar complex noun phrase [[U-tie ubi]

"177TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTThe fact that gender is a property of each noun lexeme (with the exception of
nouns referring to humans and higher animates), constitutes a difference from
many gender systems found on New Guinea. There, even many two-term systems with female and male as the semantic core for animates, are classifying, in
the sense that (inanimate) nouns take their gender from the semantic properties
of the referent. In such systems, we may find that ‘house’ is masculine if it is
long or big and feminine if it is round or small, and so forth (Foley 1986: 77–
91).
Most non-Austronesian languages of Island Melanesia have some form of gender or noun classes, and this has been taken to indicate deep-level genetic relationships. However, Terrill’s (in press) investigation of the available data shows
that there is a great deal of variation between the languages, in terms of the
number of distinctions made, the semantic bases of the systems, and the forms
of the morphemes that express gender in the grammars of these languages. If
the languages are indeed related, it is possible that the relationships between the
systems have been obscured by the long time that has elapsed since their separation. Alternatively, and on the present data perhaps more likely, the property
of having gender is an areal feature predating the arrival and spread of Austronesian languages through the region.
The rest of this section will be devoted to investigating gender in the plain and
the n declensions, whose members do not have gender through morphological
assignment.
5.6.1
Covertness of gender in the plain and n declensions
Kuot gender conforms to Hockett’s statement that ‘[g]enders are classes of
nouns reflected in the behaviour of associated words’ (1958: 231). In only three
Kuot nouns that I am aware of is gender as such marked on the noun itself, and
in all three cases the marking appears to be adjectival (see below). In the rest of
the vocabulary, gender and number are reflected morphologically only in
agreement, indexing and cross-referencing morphology.31 The form of the noun
gives no indication as to what gender it belongs to.
One way to show that form is unrelated to gender would be through homonyms,
but there are very few homonyms in Kuot that do not involve loan words (for
which see below). I am aware of only a few homonyms and near-homonyms,
some of which have different genders:

"From the speaker responsible for Figure 7, we also have an example of a negated verbless clause. The first part (u-to pianǝm Bimun) is topicalised (here
marked by ga) and has non-final intonation with a peak on the last syllable.
After that the pitch falls to the penultimate syllable of the utterance, to rise
again on the last syllable:

1.1.5
Locationals and directionals
Like many languages in Oceania, Kuot has a set of deictic forms that encode
not only a referent’s distance from the deictic centre, but also the direction, and
to an extent elevation. The Kuot forms I call locational/directional are used in
adverbial functions, and have seven basic senses (ten forms). There are locational senses such as ‘here’ (to) and ‘there’ (tie), but also more complex directional6 ones such as ‘down; seawards; northwest’ (-dǝŋ), ‘up; uphill’ (tuan), and
‘other way; southeast’ (-ma). Figure 1 illustrates the use of the three most basic
terms.","[29, 30]"
"22INTRODUCTION: LANGUAGE NAME AND PREVIOUS SOURCESone of the languages. This more or less reflects a view of the situation that most
linguists would subscribe to. However, the small size and selection of items on
the word list has given some surprising results, such as a 16% cognacy rate
between the Patpatar language and Kuot (but 10% between Madak and Kuot,
and 22% between Patpatar and Madak). The authors list the following village
names on the west coast: Naiama, Panaras, Neiruaran, Patlangat and Bimun;
and on the east coast: Kama, Lomaloa, Liadan and Kabil.
Capell (1969: 95) uses Kuot data to support his division of New Guinea languages in various structural types and subtypes (which will not be reviewed
here), giving one verb paradigm and three sentences (which are incorrectly
segmented).
Capell (1971) is a treatise on the Austronesian languages of New Guinea, but
does include Kuot (Panaras) in word lists (p. 256–259), on the map (p. 255) and
briefly in the text (p. 263).
Beaumont (1972) is a bibliography of linguistic work in New Ireland. Apart
from some of the works indicated here, a few more mention Kuot but are either
maps or mentions that give no comment (e.g. Wurm (1971) which just reports
that it is established as a Papuan language).
Wurm (1975) attempts to classify all non-Austronesian languages in island
Melanesia into families, stocks and phyla. The so called “East Papuan Phylum”
in his view includes languages of New Britain, Bougainville Province, the
Solomon Islands, Kuot, and Yele of Rossel Island in Milne Bay province. The
classification is made on grounds of similarities in morphological systems (but
often not shared morphemes; p. 786–787), such as the presence of gender/noun
classes, and cross-referenced subjects (and objects) on verbs. This classification
is based on very little data, and the absence of shared morphological items
makes it at best hypothetical. Kuot is classified as a family-level isolate (p.
789).
Ross (1994) discusses the phonologies of several languages in New Ireland and
groups the Austronesian languages into language/dialect networks. He identifies
a phonological alliance, made up by certain phonological processes and restrictions that are shared by Kuot and its nearest neighbours but not further afield,
and concludes that the Madak phonology is the result of a language shift by an
adult population (cf. 3.10). With respect to Kuot, Ross (1997) is mainly a summary (p. 246) of the (1994) paper.
Chung & Chung’s 75-page Kuot Grammar Essentials is the first attempt (1996)
at a description of the grammatical structure of Kuot, and as such was very useful to me to get an idea of the language before going to the field.21 They have
21 Once in the field, I decided not to use it, so as to arrive at my own conclusions basedon the data I was collecting. As is wont to happen when several people work on a language, many of our analyses differ; it is also possible that the Chungs have revised
some of their ideas during the seven or eight years that they have continued to work on
the language after writing the grammar sketch.","[43, 44]"
"125TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTphological one.18 However, the use of forms that sound like 3mS.fut appears to
have spread from verb class II, where the subject markers are prefixes, to verb
class III where they occur medially, in particular in the verb ‘come’:
(101) mu-na-oŋ [munoŋ]J [muoŋ]come! (come-2sS.fut-stm2)Another interpretation of the same data is of course that third person address
has been used to children, and that the initial /n/ of some other words has been
dropped either independently or by phonological analogy with the class II
verbs. Third person address is otherwise not used in Kuot.
A further area where adults often adapt their speech when speaking to small
children is in intonation, particularly in yes/no questions, where the rise on the
final syllable can often be as much as a musical fifth or even more.
3.9
Phonological treatment of foreign words
The vast majority of foreign words to enter Kuot come in via Tok Pisin. Those
that are English-derived have already undergone a large measure of adaptation
to local phonologies.
Consonant clusters are dealt with in terms of epenthesis (e.g. school J sikul;
spear J supia), or reduction (e.g. trousers J rausis; needle J nil). Diphthongs
are frequently simplified too (e.g. boat J bot; day J de). Tok Pisin has fewer
phonemes than English, and there is regular mapping as follows:
(102) z
ʃ
tʃ
ʤ
θ
ðJ

Jkerosin
dis
masis
Siaman
tingting (reduplicated)
brataKuot phonological restrictions and processes then apply (somewhat variously as
we shall see) to the words used in Kuot. Although all speech sounds needed for
Tok Pisin are present in Kuot, their phonemic status is different. As we have
seen, Kuot does not allow initial [r], final [l], initial or final [v], or final voiced
stops. The local Tok Pisin does not have final voiced stops, but particularly /r/
and /l/ are common in positions not allowed in Kuot. The treatment of these
varies with several factors: the level of integration of the word into Kuot, the
age of the speaker, and the speaker’s perception of the listener. The more integrated the word and the older the speaker, the more likely it is that the adaptation to Kuot phonology will take place. On the other hand, speakers are more
likely to retain features of the original pronunciation when speaking to people
who do not know the language well. Examples of adaptation are:18 Morphological simplification does occur for some verbs of classes I and (to someextent) III, mainly through omission of the subject marker; there is also some special
vocabulary in both verbs and nouns used when addressing children.","[147, 148]"
"186NOUNS: GENDERvocabularies are fairly small (especially after omitting words from the special
declensions), which makes it difficult to say anything definite.

bloodHere the feminine tendency seems reasonably strong, but there is also varying
usage for several words.
It should be noted also that words that can function as verb stems in verb class I
(pipi, kasup, mabis, mage.is) are almost exclusively feminine (see discussion on
nominalisations below in this section and 5.8).
If there has been a principle of assigning words for liquids to the feminine gender, it appears not to be operating any longer, as most recent Tok Pisin loans in
this area receive masculine gender (at least for most speakers), e.g. ‘kerosin’
(kerosine), ‘spirit’ (spirits), ‘kodiel’ (cordial), ‘bia’ (bear); though some are
feminine, e.g. ‘sup’ (soup) and ‘ti’ (tea).
Sharp instruments have a small tendency to be feminine too (but note too that
some of the words for spears given in (60) were masculine):

scraper’, and kar/mimidu/mudǝmudǝnun ‘coconut scraper’, which are all feminine. However, these are also the names for the shells from which the implements are made, so again other principles may be at work. When Tok Pisin
‘naip’ is used for knife, it is feminine, and so are the loan words nil/nin and pin
(from ‘needle’ and ‘pin’).
In the category fire, we have kit ‘fire’ which is feminine; related words like
bonǝt ‘smoke’ and utǝrǝ ‘ashes’ are also feminine, but this does not necessarily
indicate a principle to do with fire. Ilak ‘lightning’ and ileŋ ‘daylight’ are also
feminine. ‘Dry coconut frond; torch’, pirit, is masculine, as are the Tok Pisin187TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTloan words ‘sikar’ and ‘simuk’ for cigarette. The words for ‘coal/ember’ and
‘burning stick of firewood’ are in the special declensions.
Substances and mass nouns used in the singular (cf. 5.5 above) are another
category that could potentially receive special treatment. Words for liquids were
given in (66) above, but there are others that may be regarded as substances:
(68)tes

pusThese give no indication of a gender preference, which is perhaps not surprising, given that the count vs. mass distinction is not generally grammatically reflected in the language.
Most time words are feminine, excepting one word meaning ‘time’:
(69)la
f
parabira f
(na)bit
f
ileŋ

arubu
f
tǝrǝ
mday/time

timeTok Pisin loans such as the names of weekdays are feminine too, and other time
words are treated as feminine by most speakers: ‘aua’ (hour), ‘minit’ (minute),
‘wik’ (week). Interestingly, when the Tok Pisin word ‘taim’ (time) is used, it is
masculine like its translation equivalent tǝrǝ.
Abstract nouns have a tendency to be feminine (leaving nominalisations aside
for the moment):

behaviourNominalisations are generally feminine too. There are two types of nominalisations (meaning action nominals) in Kuot: morphological and non-morphological. Among morphological nominalisations, we find nominalisations from class
II and III verbs and nominalisations from adjectives. In both cases, the resulting
nouns are always feminine. This may be regarded as another type of morphological gender assignment, alongside the special declensions, since this type of
nouns is recognisable through the nominalisation morphology (cf. 1.1.2):188NOUNS: GENDER

slipperyThe picture is a little more complex when we turn to the relation between nouns
and stems of verb class I, which is non-morphological, that is, there is no morphological marking of the transfer between classes. Stems which can be used
either as nouns or in verb class I tend overwhelmingly to be feminine in their
nominal use. What this means for the question of gender semantics is difficult
to say. That is, is it the case that these nouns are feminine because they are also
verb stems; or are they feminine for independent reasons, such as the fact that
they denote liquids? In the latter case it could be that they can be recruited for
verb use as a secondary effect of being feminine. In 1.1.2, I argue that verb
class I is a relatively late development in the language, evolved from noun +
alienable possessive marker. This would suggest that gender properties, being
nominal properties, are prior to verb-forming properties, but it is also possible
to imagine a degree of realignment for noun stems used as verbs. As there is no
overt morphology marking their association with verbs, we would not want to
call this morphological gender assignment.
Inherently locative nouns are feminine too; see 5.7.1.
Another semantic category sometimes utilized in gender systems is nouns for
artefacts and/or culturally and ritually important things (e.g. Lavukaleve
where they are in the neuter gender (Terrill 1999: 126) and Ojibwa and other
Algonquian languages, reported in Corbett (1991: 20, 315). The following

No tendency has been noted for items concerned with male spheres of activity
to follow masculine gender, or vice versa.
More generally, much traditional knowledge has been lost, and there may be
mythical associations embedded in the system that are no longer known by
speakers.
5.6.3.3 Loans
It has been shown in the foregoing that loanwords appear not to adhere to those
weak tendencies that can be suggested on the basis of the available data. This
implies that such principles are not accessible to speakers. A few more notes
may be made on the topic of loan words.
First, it is interesting to ask speakers why particular words are in particular genders (although the answers should be treated with some caution). I have never
heard anyone make reference to male/female-ness for inanimates, nor to properties like shape or size, or cultural importance etc. For loan words, the only principle that does get quoted is analogy with indigenous Kuot words. This is reasonable for instance with ‘taim’ (time) which is masculine like Kuot tǝrǝ, and
‘naip’ (knife) which is feminine like Kuot ie, since these are used in replacement of the indigenous words. Similarly, all words for boats (‘spidbot’, ‘bot’,
‘sip’ etc.) are feminine like Kuot obinǝm ‘canoe’.
But there are also many cases of mismatch. For example: bǝbam ‘leaf; book’ is
feminine, but ‘buk’ is masculine; kukuom ‘tree, wood; medicine’ is feminine
but ‘marasin’ (medicine) is masculine; koi ‘half hard shell of coconut, plate’ is
masculine but ‘plet’ is feminine (in Bimun); paragima ‘cut or split piece of
wood (plank, firewood, bamboo pole etc.)’ is masculine, but ‘pleng’ is feminine. (In all cases, the gender given is the one used by at least some speakers;
others may pick a different gender.)
When it comes to words for things that have come in after white contact the
analogy model is sometimes even less convincing. For example, all items of
clothing are masculine, and this is said to be on analogy with buruma ‘laplap’,
which is masculine. I have not been able to get a pre-laplap sense for buruma,
but we may note that the two other words for items used as clothing given in
(72), kapǝt ‘pandanus mat or “raincoat” (also pandanus sp.)’ and bekǝt
‘hat/cap’, are feminine.
We also saw that liquids and words to do with fire tend to be feminine; yet
‘kerosin’ (kerosine) is masculine (no analogy was presented for this word).
When speakers wish to express this sense in Kuot, burunǝm ‘water’ which is190NOUNS: GENDERfeminine is used. Similarly, the loan word ‘kar’ (car) is masculine, but when
loan words are avoided it is replaced by obinǝm ‘canoe’ (elliptic for obinǝm
meioŋ mi-lǝ toktok-im ‘the red ones’ canoe’, i.e. ‘white people’s canoe’) which
is feminine.
In the case of ‘bilum’, ‘net bag’, discussed in 5.6.2.1 above, some speakers use
masculine, giving kein ‘type of basket’ as the gender template (although other
baskets are feminine). At least one speaker using it as feminine said it sounded
feminine, which could indicate a sensitivity for the morphological assignment
rules, whereby the majority of nouns ending in /m/ are feminine, although such
rules are not generally known, even implicitly.
5.6.4
Gender markedness
No unequivocal answer can be given to the question of which gender is unmarked; the possible criteria point in different directions..
Masculine is used of referents whose gender is unknown, e.g.:
(73)aka i-sik?
who 3m-DEM
‘who is that?’
mani i-to?
what 3m-here
‘what is this?’Aka ‘who’ is normally used with masculine agreement even when there is
reason to believe it is a woman, for instance if you hear someone in the night
and the voice is female.
The following is used to inquire of the sex of a newborn baby:
(74)i-ari-a
man kulot?
3fS-carry-3mO what child/boy
‘what (sex) child did she (the mother) have?’The word pǝgǝ ‘thing’ is mostly used as masculine too:
(75)man pǝgǝ
i-tie?
what thing(m) 3m-there
‘what’s that?’A possible alternative analysis here is that the nouns are simply masculine (aka
‘who’, mani ‘what’ etc.).37
As mentioned in 5.6.3.1, masculine is used also for mixed-gender collectives.
Since gender is not distinguished in non-singular grammatical morphology, the
use of masculine for mixed groups can only be seen lexically, where the nonsingular of the masculine rather than the feminine is used for mixed groups (example (59) above).
37 I discussed this possibility with my main informant, who was not convinced. Al-though he was by then very much used to discussing grammatical gender, his unwillingness to say that aka etc. are masculine may be due to their referential possibilities.","[208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"
"52KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: KINSHIPcategory of songs used primarily for the paternal aunties to sing while carrying
parcels of food to the nephew (or indeed niece); the songs were called sǝpda
and their purpose was to celebrate the nephew or niece.
It is interesting that both joking relations, the nabar and kokup relations, are
close-kin cross-moiety relations. They can both be said to express dangerous
forces: sexuality vis-a-vis a close relative (albeit of the opposite moiety), and
rudeness and stealing and so forth on levels that are not acceptable anywhere
else within the system; both forces that normally have to be contained.
The behavioural requirements of these different types of relationships lead to
what superficially seems like inconsistent behaviour, as an individual may vary
between easy-going, subdued and rude depending on who else is present.
Breeches of taboos in the past were punished differently depending on the nature of the crime. It was always the bigmen who determined the sentence.
Smaller crimes, perhaps touching a distant sister’s hair, were fined, shell money
and or pigs to be given to the injured party or his or her (male) relatives. Any
sexual relations within the same clan were considered serious cases of incest
and were sometimes punished by death, whereby the convicted person had to
commit suicide (usually by hanging; see further 2.7 for comments on death).
There are some categories of people who are largely exempt from kin-based
rules. Children were mentioned above. Crazy people also cannot be expected to
always follow the established rules of society, nor foreigners from faraway
places such as Australia or Sweden. Modern times have also brought situations
in which many rules have to be suspended, such as the crowded transports to
Kavieng. This has contributed to a general weakening of the rules, which have
also been undermined by the acceptance of Christianity by the population,
whereby the force of much everything related to custom has been diminished.
The system operates and is very salient, but the force is lesser and the only
punishment of breeches that I am aware of is social disapproval (which is of
course not the least of motivations in human life).
A large number of relationships stem from birth, and more are added through
marriage. Even given the prescribed behaviour concomitant with particular kin
relations, personality and personal preferences are of course essential to the nature of the relationship that any individual actually has with another. As mentioned, locality also factors in, so that actual relationships are built and maintained through interaction, for which the persons need to be in the same place.
2.6.5
Name taboos and alternative forms of address
A component common to all relationships characterized by respect is the name
taboo. Two people in such a relation are not to say the each other’s name, and if
a woman’s brother’s name is John, she is not to use the name John of any other
man by that name either. Instead appellations such as ‘the husband of Lin’ or
‘the father of Joel’ are used. A man can refer to his sister as ‘the mother of the
children’, for instance when inquiring at her homestead of her whereabouts.
Even in public addresses at village meetings, the announcer will use descrip-53TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTtions such as ‘the in-law in Okoiok’ rather than reading out the name of a taboo
relative from a list.
In the community, of course everybody knows what the relationships of others
are, and that makes it easier to work out who is meant (as you will know who
cannot be mentioned by a speaker), but there are still frequent misunderstandings, and it is common for an interlocutor to fill in the name if it is one that they
are allowed to say. Sometimes a third party is called upon to pronounce the
name of ‘the auntie in Kabil’ and so forth. Taking down a genealogy tends to
involve a whole group of people and a fair amount of yelling across the village
so that all names can be said.
The name taboos are mostly reciprocal, and mostly cover both address and third
person mention, but there are a few exceptions. A woman can say the name of
her brother’s wife (both to and about her), but not vice versa. A man may only
say the name of a man married to his sister when that man is out of earshot.
Other alternative forms of address or mention for people whom one is allowed
to address at all are by kin term (though not all terms appear to be used in this
way), physical characteristics (e.g. piek ‘bald person’) or other properties (e.g.
ŋoŋ ‘crazy person’), or function. Given the extremely low degree of professional specialisation in this society, function may have come in only in fairly
recent times (e.g. komiti for the chairman of the village council, or pasta for the
pastor).
Nicknames also exist, and are exempt from the taboo. For instance, one man has
been known as Sikarama ‘dry twig’ ever since he was a child because he was so
skinny, and people who are not allowed to pronounce his name quite happily
use the nickname.
Name taboos are not entirely defining of the nature of the relationship, in several ways. First, the core – periphery principle set out in 2.6.3 means that more
respectful behaviour is accorded a “real” brother than a “distant” brother (by a
woman), but the name taboo still applies to both. While a woman avoids many
types of interaction with her real brother, she may be heard telling a distant
brother to stop telling lies and get on with the job, in direct address. Second,
names are avoided (but not taboo) in several relationships which are not avoidance relationships, as a sign of respect. This applies from children to parents in
most families, and from niece or nephew to maternal uncle. I have also heard a
woman ask for her husband and a mother for her grown son in roundabout
ways; these are just personal choices and subject to inter- and intra-speaker
variation. A further feature of name taboos is that they apply more strictly to
indigenous names than to so called Christian names (i.e. names having come in
through Western mediation, ranging from Ezekiel to Benny, and from Ruth to
Roslyn), but still speakers are very unwilling to use either.
A special relationship also holds between two persons called by the same name,
and they are not to refuse each other anything. The namesake relation is called
bekulǝ and this term is often used in address between the two, stressing the
bond.
54KUOT AND ITS SPEAKERS: OTHER ETHNOGRAPHIC NOTESA very interesting aspect of some of the respect relationships is non-singular
address for singular referents. A man and his brother-in-law, and a woman and
her sister-in-law generally address each other with the term makapien. This has
the form of a regular dual, but there is no corresponding singular or non-singular (plural) form. Address traditionally was with dual cross-referencing on
verbs, and this is still heard in some cases, or even with mixed second person
singular and dual forms. Similarly, if a man had to address his female crosscousin, he would use a plural form of the term kokole: kokolaip. The expression
‘mother of the children’ mentioned above was also frequently in the plural (nagap meiam lop ‘mothers of the children’, or using the name of a child e.g. nagap iam Ruth ‘mothers of Ruth’); correspondingly the woman could refer to her
brother as irap am Eskol ‘fathers of Eskol’. It is possible that there were more
such usages in the past. The ones given here are remembered and used occasionally, but are disappearing.

Other ethnographic notes
It is quite difficult to get a reliable picture of anything from the past, and accounts of almost any aspect of life often vary wildly between different speakers.
What is presented here has been pieced together with the aid of accounts from
different speakers, sometimes evaluated in the light of some of the historical
and current information on neighbouring peoples (while trying not to be too influenced by these, as it is likely that there were differences), and also using
plausibility as a criterion.38
2.7.1
Rituals in life and death
Malagan (/malangan/malanggan) is the term both for a cycle of ritual feasts and
for dance masks and other carvings associated with them. It appears that this
ritual complex is only a few centuries old, and that it may have originated in the
Tabar island group (off the east coast of New Ireland). I showed some photos of
masks and carvings in German collections, and they were identified by elderly
speakers as Tabar or Madak style. It was claimed that Kuot had a style of its
own, but I was not able to establish what characterised it. Given the low level of
identification according to language it is likely that the spread of particular
styles did not follow language boundaries. One speaker said that the Kuot
carvings were like those of Amba (Aba, Hamba) village, which is a Nochispeaking village on the east coast. Powdermaker (1971 [1933]) also describes
how the rights to make particular malagan designs (each with its own name)
were bought and sold between clans, and any particular design seems to have
been able to move around quite a bit.39
38 For instance, one speaker claimed that women were secluded for a period of severalyears during puberty, and that they each ate one pig a day. This has to be rejected on
grounds of implausibility, and other accounts by the same speaker were similarly fanciful and so had to be treated with some caution.
39 Similarly, dances (with songs) passed between different groups, and Krämer-Ban-now reports one dance all the way from Rabaul having been performed in Madak-55TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTAs for the ceremonial cycle, this is described in some detail by Powdermaker
(1971 [1933]) and Lewis (1969) for the Nochi, and since the ceremonies may be
taken to have been very similar in all important respects, and since they are no
longer practiced among the Kuots, I will only give the briefest summary here.40
Malagan feasts had multiple functions. They were the final ceremony in a sequence of mortuary rites, and at the same time the biggest feast associated with
the initiation of adolescent boys. Various other outstanding matters for clans
would be settled too. For a man, arranging a malagan feast was one of the most
important ways of gaining prestige.
After death, bigmen and possibly any old people were cremated, but it is not
clear what happened to ordinary people; in the mountains there appear to have
been burials in the ground, and near the coast it is possible that some corpses
were sunk at sea but I have no statement of the latter from the Kuots.41 In the
case of important bigmen it appears that the skull was often kept in the men’s
house and used in magic (taro and rain magic?) and perhaps other practices.
Preparations for the feast would start not long after the death. At a meeting various people would indicate how many pigs they intended to contribute by sticking the hard midrib (sokopit) of the coconut leaf in the ground. These people
could be children, in-laws, uncles or others with a relation to the dead person.
Failing to deliver when the time came caused social shame and derision of the
worst degree. Piglets then had to be acquired and raised, and about six months
before the ceremony, taro gardens would be cleared and planted, and magic
made to ensure the growth. Malagan carvings were ordered and the carver began to carve them. At each stage of preparation, a small feast would be held.
Weather magicians were paid to ensure good weather for the day or days of the
feast.
After death, a person’s spirit roams around, and particularly in the first days or
weeks may appear as a ghost, make noises such as knocking on the walls and
bothering the living in general, visiting the places that the person used to visit in
life. Various tests were carried out to check if the spirit was still around, such as
throwing small pieces of food in the fire; if it crackled it meant that the spirit
was present, “eating” the food. The mortuary feast finally removes the dead
person’s spirit from among the living. According to Kuot informants, severalspeaking Lamasong as the emperor’s birthday was celebrated in 1909 (Krämer-Bannow 1916: 96–97).
40 More general works on the malagan traditions in north-central New Ireland includeGunn (1997), Hallinan (1990) Helfrich (1973), and Krämer (1925), all of which also
have very good pictures of the associated artwork.
41 The sinking of corpses at sea in former times is mentioned by Jensen (1999: 125)writing about Madak speakers, by Krämer-Bannow (1916: 39) writing of an incident
in Baranat near Muliama in the south of New Ireland, and by Parkinson (1999 [1907]:
136) writing of Anir and Nissan islands off southern New Ireland.","[74, 75, 76, 77, 78]"
"The figure shows that while the pitch movement (the middle graph) is similar
between the two words, relative intensity (waveform in top graph) varies considerably, and there is also some difference in relative duration.
In the following three figures, we will see two near-homonyms in three syntactic contexts. The words are ka'ranim ‘reef, low tide; year’ and 'baranim ‘store;
net for catching birds’. Figure 3 shows the two words in sentence-final position,
taken out of a prepositional phrase, where it is again clear that the stressed syllable has relatively greater duration and intensity. The pitch extraction is not
very clear for the first syllable of karanim, but the overall movement is still
similar between the two words.",[135]

‘…the tourists’ canoe’ [lit. a canoe of the travelling-around-in-places-andlooking-at-things-and-buying-things red (ones)]Another strategy for forming nominals from predicates involves the use of the
relator (lǝ) without a prefix, corresponding to a relative clause (see 1.1.8.1), but
again without a head noun. This is productive particularly in creating place
names, e.g.:

well:

The ending -sik is homonymous with the most common bound demonstrative
stem, which could well be the source. I do not know of possible sources for
-ppik or -dik. The process is not productive.
5.8.3
Nouns as predicates and in the attribute construction
A noun used in the attribute construction can be required to take predicate morphology, in most cases from verb class I. It is difficult to predict which nouns
are concerned, since some take no marking and others obligatorily take marking, and this often concerns semantically similar terms:

1sS-young.man
‘I am/was a young man’(*kubǝma=oŋ)Here the predicating noun in the first example is bare, the next three have verb
class I marking which is obligatory when the noun is used in predicate function.
Kubǝma ‘young man’ in the last example belongs to a very limited class of
nouns which take adjectival subject marking for first and second person.
The first two examples above show the predicating nouns in the attribute construction, with an indexing prefix to the relator, and in the third we have the
possibility of actor nominalisation. The slot created by the prefixed relator for
an attribute within the noun phrase has the same possibilities for predicates as
those in the relative clause which is marked by the un-affixed relator (cf. 1.1.1
and 1.1.8.1).
Human nouns are an exception to the generalisation that nouns which may be
used as class I verbs are feminine, since they follow the gender of the referent
for the verbal marking. Borrowed terms for professions always take class I
marking, e.g. titsa=oŋ ‘he is a teacher’, nas=ieŋ ‘she is a nurse.","[223, 224, 225]"

mountains (no longer, if ever, found on maps) are: Taula, Ti, Nakadi, Lǝuarǝnak (Bolouaranak), Bouoraba, Boderi, Tumauna, Buada, and Ilum Kumebun.
These were all in the southern part of the Kuot area, subsumed under the name
Taula by the administration (who had a hut there). The populations from there
established the coastal villages Bimun and Kabil in the south; Nakasǝlǝkǝp
somewhat further north; Malua near Lesu (Powdermaker 1971 [1933]: 38); and
Lakkuanip not far from Liedan in the northern part of the Kuot-speaking territory. On the west coast, the administration also used the name Neiruaran for a
portion of the coast between Panaras and Patlangat.
Walden’s 1911 report on Kuot is only 18 lines long, but is an impressively accurate and relevant description of the language, given that Walden’s task was to
collect all he could on all the languages and the ethnography of all of northern
New Ireland including New Hanover in two years. It is worth translating the
paragraph in its entirety here:
“The interior, the mountains between Hamba and Kafkaf, and the stretch of the
west coast between Lemau and Lamassaleng is of particular linguistic interest
since here, in the villages Paneras, Nayama, Laurup etc., a language has survived
which does not belong to the family of Melanesian or Malayo-Polynesian languages, but according to the conventional terminology is to be counted among
Papuan languages. The verb has several different classes according to the prefixing, suffixing, or infixing of pronouns. Two grammatical genders which, apart
from the pronouns, are marked in formatives to do with nouns and verbs, indicate that the language is more closely related to that of the Baining in NeuPommern [New Britain], of the Monumbo of Neu-Guinea etc.” (Walden 1911:
30)16Friederici notes (p. 280) that Kuot does not go across the island (as at that time
there were no Kuot villages on the east coast). He contrasts it with another linguistic group at Muliama, saying that their language area does not stretch across
as they are clearly recently immigrated (the language is shared with the Tanga

"92PHONOLOGY: CONSONANTS3.2.2.4 /n/ vs. /l/ – allophony and phonemic contrast
This section will discuss the variability and non-variability of /n/ and /l/ (and [n]
and [l]) in their various positions. It will be seen that the distinction is stable in
medial position, but has some variability in stem-final position which makes
reference to the syllable, and also some variability in initial position which
makes reference to other factors.
The phonemic differentiation between /l/ and /n/ is the clearest where they occur in intervocalic (medial) position in the middle of stems, e.g. in these two
stems from verb class II:
(25)-pinǝ
-pilǝdance
be ripe, ready to eatVerb class II is a closed class, and is thought to be the oldest verb class in the
language (cf. 1.1.2.1), so the fact that it contains minimal pairs such as these is
an indication that the phonemic distinction between /l/ and /n/ in intervocalic
position is not recent in the language.
As noted earlier, the stem-initial position in this verb class is never word-initial,
since the stems are bound forms with obligatory subject prefixes, and in this respect stem-initial segments are intervocalic rather than initial. The presence of
two minimal pairs for /n/ vs. /l/ in stem-initial position in this verb class thus
provides support for the statement that the differentiation between /n/ and /l/ in
intervocalic position is quite clear (while the situation in word-initial position is
another matter):
(26)-num
-lumwalk
fall-na
-lareturn
goFor one noun, age-based variation in medial position was reported: suanǝbǝlat/
sualǝbǝlat ‘stick for putting out fire in mumu’ where the pronunciation with [n]
is used by older speakers and [l] by younger speakers.
As stated above, /l/ is not possible in final position, and segments pronounced
[l] intervocalically are realised as [n] when final, the two sounds being in an
allophonic relation in this position:
(27)gun [gʊn]gun-up [gʊlʊp}]breadfruitIt would appear that resyllabification takes place, giving the non-singular form
/gu.lup/ (see also (30) below).
Many words ending in /n/ in the singular have deviant non-singular forms (e.g.
sg: muan, nsg: muap; see further 5.2), but of those that do form non-singular by
addition of the non-singular suffix -(i)p (which assimilates to -up in some contexts), about half were given with the [n] retained in the non-singular, and the
other half with [l]. However, although there is a tendency for particular words
to have either [n] or [l], both are possible for all words ending in [n] in the singular and taking the non-singular ending, for instance:
(28)kapuon [kawɔn]kapuon-up [kawɔnʊp}] ~ [kawɔlʊp}]goatfish93TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTThere is no clear pattern to the distribution of [n] vs. [l] in the words that do
show a preference, in terms of stress or surrounding phonemes, except for a
tendency for words containing /l/ elsewhere to retain a final [n] when the nonsingular is added.
That the [n] to [l] variation is productive is demonstrated by Tok Pisin loan
words such as the following, where the non-singular forms are typically pronounced with [l]:
(29)sippun [sɪpʊn]
sospen [sɔspɛn]sippun-up [sɪpʊlup}]
sospen-ip [sɔspɛlip}]spoon
saucepanThe data presented thus far has shown that there is not a sharp differentiation
between the phones [n] and [l] in final position, but is not sufficient to argue for
either /n/ or /l/ as the underlying phoneme. A further example shows that [l] is
disallowed not only word-finally but syllable-finally. The example is the word
for ‘blood’ in two different pronunciations:
(30)general pronunciation:
olǝbuan blood
archaic(?) pronunciation: onbuan bloodThe variant given as archaic was reported to me as the pronunciation of a particular speaker’s grandmother and may simply represent intra-speaker variation
without indicating that the form was in more general use in earlier times. My
data has no syllable-final instances of [l] (although [n] does occur, e.g. kunmǝra
‘scorpion’ and matakinkin ‘snail (sp.)’), but what is interesting about example
(30) is the equivalence of [n] and [l] in the same word when a vowel is inserted.
Somewhat similarly, there is dialectal variation in the form of the following
verb stem:
(31)southern Kuot: kakkǝn
northern Kuot: kakkalecarry child on shoulder (V cl I)Younger speakers make a distinction between /l/ and /n/ in final position in Tok
Pisin and in loans from Tok Pisin (e.g., ‘wilwil’, ‘bicycle’) while elderly speakers frequently pronounce both as [n], and for instance the Kuot-speaking village
Kabil on the east coast is usually pronounced [kabin] by the older group. (The
village was established in the 20th century in Nochi-speaking territory, and the
place name is presumably in the Nochi language.) Nevermann, publishing some
of Walden’s notes from 1907–1909 (Walden & Nevermann 1941), uses the
spelling “Kul” for the (former) village Kun in the north of the Kuot territory,
suggesting that the northern dialect may have been less strict in disallowing a
final [l].
A further set of words show a variation of [n] to [l] associated with the nonsingular. This concerns some of the nouns in the special declensions, where the
declension-identifying ending contains [n]; this is sometimes converted to [l] in
the non-singular, e.g.:
(32)94sg: kǝsonǝma
sg: lǝganǝm
sg: marabunansg: kǝsolǝp
mango tree
nsg: lǝgalup
nut (sp.)
nsg: marabulǝp nipplePHONOLOGY: CONSONANTSAnother context triggering the variation is the future forms of some verb stems
in classes II and III. This variation is not productive, but in all cases where a
non-future stem ends in [n] and has a future form involving an addition to the
non-future form, the [n] becomes [l], e.g.:
(33)tarak-u-ban
vomit-3mS-stm2
‘he vomits/vomited’tarak-a-bǝluŋ (class III)
vomit-3mS.fut-stm2.fut
‘he will vomit’(34)me-in
3pS-stand
‘they stand/stood’me-iliŋ (class II)
3pS-stand.fut
‘they will stand’Since the morphological variation here is no longer productive, these examples
serve to show that the phonological variation “frozen” in the forms is likely to
be quite old in the language.
It should be pointed out that not all morphemes following a final [n] trigger the
alternation; only the non-singular on nouns (and the obsolete future marking on
some verbs) do so.3
In initial position, there is again an amount of variability, although most words
beginning in [n] or [l] are stable. The variation here is different from that found
in final positions, and depends on factors such as the grammatical class of the
morpheme, and the dialect and age of the speaker. There is also inter-speaker
variation among speakers of the same generation and dialect, and in some cases
variation in the speech of an individual.
Grammatical morphemes, and to an extent lexical morphemes from closed
classes, are more likely to be changeable than open-class lexical ones. There
also appears to be more variability in the northern dialect, so that [l] in the
southern dialect frequently corresponds to [n] in the north. For example, while
speakers in the south mainly use the form laurup for the adverb ‘down’, this is
often (but not always) rendered as naurup in the north. Particular other forms
are prone to variation. Thus for instance nǝmo/lǝmo ‘want, say, be about to;
COMPLementiser’ is subject to inter-speaker variation whereby one speaker of
about 30 years of age in Bimun in the south consistently uses nǝmo in all functions, while another Bimun speaker of the same age consistently uses lǝmo (the
first is male and the second is female, but I have found no general gender correlation of this variation). One speaker of about 30 years of age, in Panaras in
the north, consistently uses the form [ni] for the third person dual subject prefix
in verb classes II and III which is normally li- (and [niɔŋ] for the subject enclitic =lioŋ of verb class I).
There is also intra-speaker variation, so that one speaker may vary within his or
her speech, although this is rather limited. For example in one story by an elderly Bimun speaker, lǝmo occurs once in the sense ‘want/be about to’ while the
3 In this, final [n] behaves like final /t/, whose allophone [r] is triggered in preciselythese contexts, but unlike /p/ and /k/ whose allophony is triggered in any intervocalic
position.","[114, 115, 116, 117]"

perhaps if the theory of an origin in prepositional phrases is accepted; if so we
could say that they are derived nouns, and feminine does tally with the fact that
nominalisations from verbs and adjectives are feminine (cf. 5.6.3.2 above).
5.7.2
Relational nouns
There is a group of nouns in Kuot which we may call relational nouns. They express concepts such as ‘behind’ and ‘in between’. As mentioned above, they are
a type of inherently locative noun. In many ways they resemble body part
nouns, but there are differences. The relation of parts, including body parts, to
the whole is expressed with the set of inalienable possessive markers, called
PossI. These can be used to link the possessed noun phrase to another noun
phrase, or they can be used pronominally, i.e. without a following noun phrase.
Relational nouns are used in the same construction as nouns denoting parts,
e.g.:
(86)Pa-la
ga pa-la
ga pa-la

‘We went and we went and we went and we (went and) arrived at the mouth of
this big sea, in the middle of the trees.’(The speaker is describing a lake, for which there is no Kuot word.) The example shows a relational noun, kabirǝna ‘middle’, on the last line, and a regular
noun, nǝnǝm ‘mouth’, on the second line. Note how nǝnǝm takes the preposition
na, while kabirǝna does not.
A further difference is that body part nouns can be used with alienable possessives (PossII). PossI codes parthood, and since the body part can in principle be
detached from the body and talked of as a non-part, it can also take PossII coding (cf. 1.1.3). The relational nouns, on the contrary, can only be used with

"While the length of the last syllable is the same for the two words, the difference in duration of the stressed and the non-stressed syllable out of the first two
is quite obvious, and there is some difference also in loudness. Pitch falls across
both words, as in the previous example which was also sentence-final.
In the next figure, we see the two words in non-initial, non-final position. They
occur in the syntactically unmarked position for a nominal functioning as an
argument of the verb, namely following it. In Figure 4, the (constructed)

"All of these (except perhaps kabirǝna) are very common, and I have never heard
arubu used with the preposition; nor have I heard ileŋ or bit without it, as greetings.
(This type of greeting is almost certainly inspired by contact with white people. Another type exists alongside it, namely the questions ‘where are you going?’ and ‘where
are you coming from?’. These were reported early in this area, and are likely to be
much older in origin.)196NOUNS: SUB-CLASSES OF NOUNSPossI. This is a consequence of their semantics rather than a lexical restriction:
while there can be a leg without a pig attached, there cannot be a ‘behind’ that
is not behind something. There is no possibility of using the relational nouns to
denote parts (such as ‘back’ or ‘front’); they are only ever relational, and never
referential.

are acceptable to different speakers, and the degree to which such forms are

that they do not exist.
Thus kabirǝna and arabura were at first given the genders now in parentheses,
while other speakers later said that they do not have gender (I have no examples
from texts where any other constituent agrees with any of these words). Kabirǝna and arabura are normally used in the singular, regardless of the number of
referents of the second noun phrase, as in (86). But I was given an example of

Mǝlonim ‘behind’, on the other hand, itself takes dual or non-singular form depending on the number of the possessor, according to my informants (only examples with possessors in the singular occur naturally in my data, so these are
examples given me when discussing these words with speakers):
(88)mǝlonim tuo
behind
1s.PossI
‘behind me’mǝlonim-up-ien lie
behind-nsg-dl
3d.PossI
‘behind them (2)’mǝlonim-up ma
behind-nsg 3p.PossI
‘behind them’In the third person, it is of course also possible to have a possessor noun, e.g.
mǝlonim-up ma makaulǝp ‘behind the women’. Mǝlonim is used also of non-197TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOToriented items, for instance expressing that something can be behind a stone or
tree, which do not have inherent fronts or backs.42
Sometimes there is no possessive marking, if the object or person to which the
location is being related can be understood from context. In this example, reference is made to a woman who is uphill from the place of speaking but on her
way down, after the speaker, who is also on her way down, and speaking to yet
a third woman. The elided possessive phrase would refer to the speaker:
(89)Eba no-du=ieŋ
u-timaidǝŋ
mǝlonim
FUT 2sO-push=3fS
3f-downwards behind
‘The one coming down behind will give you a push’In terms of number inflection, lekke (/leikke) ‘before’ is at least partly similar to
mǝlonim: it takes the dual form when the possessor is dual (but was initially
said to have no non-singular form). These constructions are unique within Kuot:
nowhere else does the number of the possessor govern the form of the possessed (in this case those relational nouns that have this construction).43
Uadan/uadanim ‘between’ is a little different for different speakers. Some will
allow for it to be used only of a situation where something is found in between
two other referents (e.g. ‘between the (2) houses’). For other speakers, predominantly speakers of northern Kuot, it can be used synonymously with kabirǝna
and arabura for ‘middle, midst’.
Arakkin ‘opposite’ is used for alignment in either the horizontal or the vertical
dimension; above or across. In one narrative, the first coconut palm grew
straight over the grave of a man, and arakkin was used. It can also be used for
‘opposite’ or ‘straight across’, as in ‘the hotel is directly opposite the bank’.
5.7.3
pǝsǝnǝ‘clansman, clanswoman’, bonim ‘name’
I am aware of two exceptions to the statement that the choice between PossI and
PossII possessive marking is semantic rather than lexical (cf. 1.1.3): bonim
‘name’ (which is treated as a body part in many languages), and pǝsǝnǝ ‘clansman, clanswoman’, which are both used with PossI44 – this is particularly surprising for pǝsǝnǝ since all other kin terms take PossII possessive marking.45 An
42 The Kuot use of ‘behind’ is thus similar to that of English in this respect, but unlikethat of Longgu (Austronesian, Solomon Islands) in which directional terms like
‘inland’ and ‘seaward side’ are used to relate locations to objects without back/front
orientation, unless they are in motion (Hill 1997: 122).
43 Both lekke and mǝlonim also have some temporal uses, which will not be exploredhere.
44 There is some variation among words for pimples, sores, substances emanating fromthe body and the like, which may be partly lexical as well.
45 Interestingly, Volker reports from Nalik that alienable possessive marking is replac-ing inalienable marking, including kin terms, and the only kin term that is presently
only ever used with the inalienable marking is the corresponding Nalik term tau
(Volker 1998: 132).","[218, 219, 220]"
"TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT1.1.1
Nominals
Nouns have the inherent and covert category of gender (masculine or feminine)
in the singular, and the context-dependent and overt category of number (singular, dual, plural), where dual and plural but not singular are marked by suffixes. On the nouns themselves, the plural form is referred to as non-singular
(nsg), as this form is also the base for the dual.
In most parts of the grammar, there is no singular marking independent of gender, and no gender marking independent of singular, giving the following overall marking system:2
masculine
femininedualpluralNouns fall into several declensions. About half the nouns in the language simply have the non-singular ending -(i)p suffixed to the end of the word. I call this
the plain declension. Most of the rest have the last syllable or last segment subtracted before the non-singular is added (the special declensions). Mostly, the
special declensions are associated with a particular gender. The declensions are
not productive, and all loans go into the plain declension. Many kin terms and a
few person words form dual and plural/non-singular on a different pattern (cf.
5.4.1).
Gender is covert on nouns in the plain declension, but is expressed on verbs
(marking subject and object), adjectives (marking subject), possessives (marking possessor and, for some, possessee), prepositions (indexing the nominal)
and demonstratives (indexing the nominal).
Agreement and cross-referencing morphology have forms for twelve pronominal categories. They are:

Nominalisations: actor nominals
Another type of nominalisation is actor nominalisation, that is, a form derived
from a verb or adjective, signifying the one who performs an action (e.g. ‘runner’ from ‘run’). Actor nominalisations do not have their own morphology in
Kuot. The main strategy used is the same as for the attribute construction (cf.
1.1.1), and it is highly productive. The primary function of this construction is
to make an attribute of a predicate (or other constituent) within a noun phrase.
The attribute construction is marked by the relator lǝ, prefixed with the nominal
(demonstrative) agreement markers, e.g.:
(94) [kit
u-lǝ
kan-u]
fire(f) 3f-RELR big-3f
‘big fire’In actor nominalisations, we often find such constructions, but without heads,
e.g.:
(95) [i-lǝ
3m-RELR
‘God’kan-i]
big-3mThe expression in (95) is fully established in the sense ‘God’ but does sometimes still occur with the head noun ‘man’:47
(96) [mikana i-lǝ
man
3m-RELR
‘God’kan-i]
big-3mPresumably, most of these expressions arose through ellipsis, but many are now
highly conventionalised and are used mostly without the former head noun, e.g.:
(97) [i-lǝ
u-ari-o
kier]
3m-RELR 3mS-carry-3fO spear/stick(f)
‘policeman’ [lit. (the one who) carries a stick (i.e. rifle)]

3p-RELR red-3p

‘~(the ones) whose skin is red’We have also seen i-lǝ kid-i ‘slippery (one)’, the name used for several species
of parrotfishes and wrasses, mentioned in note 35.
Nominals formed in this way can have further modifiers, including an attribute
of the same type, creating a very long noun phrase, as in the sentence from
which (98) was taken:
(99)…[obinǝm
canoe(f)meioŋ
3p.PossII.3f[mi-lǝ
toktok-im
3p-RELR red-3p47 Both expressions have counterparts in Tok Pisin, and may be translations of these:‘bikpela’ is the adjective for ‘big’ and is used for ‘God’ (without a noun head), and
‘bikman’ (from ‘big man’) is a term for the traditional leaders in these areas, applied
also to God.","[222, 223]"
"191TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTIn contrast, feminine is used when there is no referent to agree with (i.e. no
controller; zero agreement). In Kuot, each verb and adjective has an obligatory
subject position, which has to be filled even when there is no referent. This is
the case for instance in the expression used for ‘thank you’ – as in most languages in this part of the world there was traditionally no expression translating
directly into ‘thank you’, but when the custom of using it was introduced, the
expression ‘it is good’ was recruited for the purpose. There is no real-world correspondent of ‘it’, and feminine gender is used:
(76)tema=ieŋ
be.good=3fS
‘it’s good’; ‘thank you’Similarly, the “situation in general” is cross-referenced with the feminine, as in
i-la in the next example. There is also a verb meaning, among other things, ‘to
reach’ or ‘to last until’. In this sense, it always takes feminine cross-referencing.
The following excerpt is from a story where a pregnant woman dies in the bush,
but her baby survives and feeds himself off his mother’s body and later roams
and eats from gardens in the bush. The preceding sentence translates ‘Again he
came, again he came next to his mother, again he suckled of her rot.’, and the
story continues:
(77)I-la
puo=ieŋ lǝ
[u-la
kak-kan-i],
3fS-go until=3fS RELR 3mS-go RED-big-3m
kak-kan-i=rǝ
ga u-num...
RED-big-3m=ASP and 3mS-walk
‘It went (on like this) until he went big, he was big and he walked…’There is no question of agreement with a concrete referent for the two feminine
cross-reference markers here. (The construction with puo is a type of complementation construction.)
The feminine is used also for discourse anaphors, for instance referring back to
the contents of an entire narrative (discourse deixis). In this case it is a speaker
who treats gas ‘story’ as masculine, which shows that the feminine agreement
in u-tie does not agree with ‘story’ but has precisely the function of referring
back to the preceding context:
(78)U-tie=t
<i-tma- gas>
[i-tmat gas]

tu-arǝmǝ-a.
3f-there=just 3m- -- story(m) 3m-DEM story(m) RELR 1sS-tell-3mO
Tema=ieŋ.
be.good=3fS
‘that’s it (of) <thi- story> this story I am telling. Thank you’This usage tallies with the prevalence of feminine gender for abstracts (5.6.3.2
above).
Often, agreement with an actual referent is preferred. This is the case with the
class IIb verb -it ‘know’, which tends to cross-reference the referent about
which something is or is not known, rather than the entire proposition of
knowing or not knowing, for example in the following where the object agree-192NOUNS: GENDERment is with the pigs rather than the idea of an unknown number of pigs (but

3pO-1sS-knowLooking at the distribution of nouns, the fact that such tendencies for semantic
assignment principles as can be found assign nouns to feminine classes (e.g.
categories like ‘water’ and ‘abstracts’) suggests that feminine is (or was) the
marked gender. Masculine would have been the default gender for everything
except male beings.
However, when we look at the gender distribution of words in the plain declension (Table 1 above) we can see that when there is no morphological assignment, feminine words are in the majority, although the difference is not dramatic (58% to 42% for masculine among words with known gender). Such a
distribution is more consistent with a situation where masculine is the positively
defined gender, and feminine a default gender. It is of course possible that there
were semantic categories associated with each of the genders in the past, but
that the categories defined as masculine have become even more obscured than
those defined as feminine.
5.6.5
Decline of the gender system
Kuot speakers are very much aware of their language having gender. This is because it is not present in the surrounding languages, which are all Austronesian.
However, their awareness does not extend to the distribution of referents across
the two genders. Interestingly, neither semantic nor morphological assignment
principles are accessible to most speakers. This is evident in that no speaker is
willing to guess the gender of a word that they do not know, even if it is in the
largest and most regular of the special declensions (i.e., the ma declension).
It seems reasonable to assume that there once were semantic principles for the
assignment of inanimate nouns to masculine or feminine gender, but it is clear
that these are no longer part of the competence of speakers. The inconsistencies
found with loan words are one further indication. I was also told that children
do not use gender correctly until quite late – about age seven according to my
informant (since most children in Bimun are not learning Kuot, I was not able
to make any observations on this point).38 Further, there is no creative use of
gender: in many languages, gender can be manipulated for expressive purposes
(e.g. using feminine gender for ‘man’ in Manambu conveys femininity (Aikhenvald in press), and in Lavukaleve, feminine can be used to convey smallness of
referents, although smallness is not a property of feminine nouns in general
(Terrill 1999: 129–130)); in Kuot no such usage has been observed, and none
could be elicited.","[213, 214, 215]"
"95TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTsame sense is expressed with nǝmo five times (in the same text, nǝmo also
stands for ‘say’ ten times). The generational factor is present in the pronunciation of the place name Namatanai (further south in New Ireland), which older
speakers often pronounce [lamatanaj] whereas younger speakers use an initial
[n].4
The local preposition na ‘in, at’ is always pronounced as [na] ~ [nǝ], but is
likely to bear a relation to the first part of several inherently locative nouns
which do not take a local preposition, e.g. lǝbinim ‘beach’, lǝpuo ‘men’s house’,
lakkuan ‘village’ and lauburien/laurien ‘shade’. Although the initial [l] in these
words is stable (in my experience) it seems likely that they are historically
formed by na attaching to the beginning of a stem.5
In summary, the /n/ vs. /l/ distinction is fully contrastive in medial positions,
allowing us to set up separate phonemes, whose presence in phonologically medial position in verb class II indicates some antiquity in the language. The distinction is rather more fluid at boundaries, although a syllable-final instance is
always realised as [n].
This raises the question of how to represent fluid or potentially fluid segments.
It is assumed that there is a phonemic distinction but that there are some fluctuations in some morphemes for some speakers. For initial positions, most instances are stable and are represented by ‘n’ or ‘l’ as recorded for the particular
morpheme. Note also that intra-speaker variation is rather limited, so that the
system of each speaker appears to have either /n/ or /l/ in initial position for almost all morphemes. In other words, the variability in this position is smaller on
the level of individual speakers than for the speech community as a whole.
Variable segments are written reflecting the variation, so that for instance nǝmo/
lǝmo and laurup/naurup are written as pronounced by the speaker from whom
the example is taken. In the description of morphemes, one form is taken as basic for the sake of simplicity, and alternative pronunciations are indicated.
As regards [n]/[l] in final position, there is a neutralisation of the contrast, and
perhaps the best representation would be as an archiphoneme /L/. However, for
the purposes of this thesis, the same principle as for initial position is followed,
writing ‘n’ or ‘l’. Mostly it is ‘n’, but there are some effects for non-singular
forms of nouns. Where the non-singular ending is segmentable, the stem will be
written with final ‘n’ regardless of pronunciation (tinin-iap ‘dance group-nsg’
[tiniliap]). In non-segmentable forms, such as those given in (32) above, the
non-singular will be written with ‘l’ if that is how it was recorded.","[117, 118]"

stage when many parts of the grammar already had much the form we see today: pronominal forms and locatives were established, and verb class II closed
but class III and adjectives still open (although the latter are both closed today).
Swadesh’s 100-word basic vocabulary list for Kuot gives nine words with /s/
(five nouns, three verbs of class I and one numeral), and one word with /f/
(noun).
It may also be mentioned that neither /s/ nor /f/ is voiced in intervocalic position, unlike the voiceless stops (which are the only other voiceless consonants
in the language), and in contrast to /s/ and /f/ in neighbouring languages.
3.2.4
The roles of consonants in the grammar
Some of the consonants of Kuot, while appearing in many kinds of words, also
have particular associations. Thus /t/ is common in the paradigm of locatives
and directionals (from which demonstratives are also formed); and bilabials are
associated with plural – /p/ for non-singular on nouns, and /m/ for third person
plural verb agreement and adjective suffixes. /b/ signals non-singular inclusive
in the cross-referencing morphology. Both /n/ and /l/ stand for dual on nouns
and in verbal and adjectival cross-referencing, and /ŋ/ is part of the third person
singular marking in cross-referencing (in other cases marked by vowels) and
possessor marking. Of the remaining phonemes, /k/, /d/, /g/ and /r/ do not have
systematic associations of this kind, and /s/ and /f/ do not participate in grammatical morphology.

maro thing; filler noun
lǝpulu black pig
lǝumlo brown pigThe words in the first pair here are very common, and are frequently used as
fillers while a speaker tries to think of a particular noun or proper name (glossed179TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOT‘whatsit’ in examples), taking the gender of the intended noun.32 The nonsingular and dual are regular: marǝp and marǝpien. There is also a related locative form marǝn, used when trying to think of a place name. The gendered
endings are adjective-like (as will become apparent in the following paragraphs).
The second pair is clearly derived from the adjective puppul- ‘black’ (which is
however normally reduplicated), together with the relator lǝ which is sometimes
used to form nouns (see further 5.8 for this process). The masculine and feminine forms tally with the forms used for the adjective: puppul-i for masculine
and puppul-u for feminine. However, the parallel plural/non-singular form
would be *lǝpulim, but is instead lǝpulumup, which is irregular but not adjective-like.
The last pair appears to be perfectly parallel with the second (many adjectives
end in [e] and [o] through phonological processes described in 3.3.3), but there
is not currently an adjective *umlǝ- as would be expected, neither with the
meaning ‘brown’ or any other meaning. The non-singular form is lǝumlamup.
5.6.2
Consistency in gender assignment
With extremely few exceptions, the system is stable on the level of individual
speakers, so that each speaker treats each word as either masculine or feminine
all the time. Such variation as there is thus occurs mainly between speakers.
With some words, this variation is idiolectal, with others dialectal or generational.
Many words are attested over and over in the data, and remain stable in terms of
gender (e.g. tǝrǝ ‘time’, pirit ‘dry coconut frond’, ulaŋ ‘moon, month’ which
are always masculine; and others which are always feminine, for instance karǝt
‘betelnut’ (southern Kuot), kit ‘fire’, ubi ‘garden (southern Kuot)’, alaŋ ‘road’).
But there are some curious exceptions. One concerns the word for ‘story’, gas
(south Kuot), which occurs at the beginning and often also the end of nearly
every recording from the southern Kuot-speaking area. It is treated as feminine
by most speakers in Bimun, but some elderly speakers and speakers on the west
coast mostly treat it as masculine (speakers of the northern dialect mostly use
another word, popori, which is always feminine). In some cases, it varies in the
speech of a single speaker, so that it is feminine at the beginning of the story (“I
will tell a story...”) and masculine at the end (“That’s the end of my story...”), or
vice versa.33
Another area where some variation occurs is (perhaps trivially) production mistakes, where speakers mistakenly give a word the wrong agreement. This is
32 This may be an interesting area for psycholinguistic research into gender and lexicalorganisation, since the usage of gendered fillers shows that speakers usually know the
gender of a noun before they have retrieved the lexeme they wish to use.
33 It is interesting to note that a homonym (gas) meaning ‘bush spirit being’ takes gen-der according to the sex of the referent – however, there is no indication that the words
are related.","[200, 201, 202]"
"17TOPICS IN THE GRAMMAR OF KUOTof usage it had. Unlike kulot, Kuot does not have a meaning known to presentday speakers. The only explanation for this name that I was able to get from
speakers came from one elderly man who suggested it might be because of the
use of kuot! as an exclamation expressing surprise or incredulity. Madak speakers use madak! (and in Tok Pisin ‘man!’ is used). This is a possibility, but it is
equally possible that these uses are in fact derived from the now established
names in use for the languages and peoples. It also seems likely that if such usage was salient enough for passing government officers to pick up, it would
have been found in some older sources by anthropologists, and would perhaps
have been noted as something used jokingly of neighbouring peoples and so
forth. I have not come across any such reference, even for the better-studied
Madak, Nalik and Nochi populations.
Another name identifying the Kuot language and perhaps also its speakers
among the Kuots themselves is that of Kun, a former bush village near the present site of Liedan on the east coast, to which all higher-level clans trace their
origins. We thus get expressions such as the following, with Kun taking the slot
otherwise occupied by Kuot:
(32)ties
onim Kun
language ORIG K.
‘the Kun language’Village names are still used, especially among elderly people, who will say for
example ‘the language of Lesu’ for Nochi, although it is known that it is spoken
in more than one village. The use of Kun is a little different: in my understanding there is something defining about the village of Kun because of the clans
originating from there. In contrast, I believe that the use of Lesu in the example
with Nochi is simply a case of using a name of a part to designate the whole.
The fact that languages traditionally had no names is likely to be associated
with their low identificational value in this area; cf. 2.7.5.

"24INTRODUCTION: DATAthough there is an over-representation of middle-aged and old men, the data has
a fair spread of speakers of different age and sex. Several genres are represented, such as traditional narratives, stories of the type “when I went to town
last week”, and procedural texts (“how we prepare sago”). I have no recorded
conversational data, but did often make notes of things people said in various
situations.24
The contact language was the English-lexified creole Tok Pisin, in which all
Kuot speakers are bilingual. I had learnt the basics of Tok Pisin in Canberra before coming to Papua New Guinea, and became increasingly fluent during my
time in New Ireland.
After some weeks in the field I would try to transcribe a recorded text myself,
and then go through it with the recorded speaker, or anyone else on hand. I
would also try to get vocabularies and paradigms. As everywhere, different
speakers have different talents, so that the people who are inspired storytellers
are not always the same as those who can explain the meaning and use of words
or grammatical intricacies of the language to the linguist. It soon transpired that
the best results in analysis were obtained working with a speaker in his early to
mid-thirties, Robert Sipa, who proved to have an outstanding talent for the sort
of abstractions about language that linguists are after. He became my main informant and worked with me several times a week throughout my time in
Bimun. Working consistently with one person also impacted on method, in that
we developed conventions for talking about all aspects of the language, which
made work more efficient.25 Further, he was up-to-date with what I knew and
didn’t know about Kuot, and this too helped efficiency. I would of course work
with other speakers too, and would sometimes crosscheck Robert’s information,
which I almost always found to be borne out. Although I recorded as many different speakers as I could, most of the analytic work where native-speaker intuitions and judgments were needed was carried out with his help.
It took me quite a long time to start speaking Kuot. Part of the reason was that
much of the social life in the village takes place in Tok Pisin, so that there were
few conversations in Kuot within earshot most of the time to help develop fluent understanding of it, and also few conversations to join into. There are quite
a few people who do not speak Kuot in the village, so speakers switch to Tok
Pisin very readily, and indeed code-mix a fair bit even without non-speakers
present. This meant that I would have to tell people to speak Kuot. I sometimes
did, and in particular asked Roslyn and Abraham, my host family, to try and use
Kuot to me, but this only worked part of the time.","[45, 46]"
