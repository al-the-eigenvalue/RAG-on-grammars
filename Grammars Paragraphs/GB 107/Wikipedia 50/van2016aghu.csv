"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs119Turning to verbal clauses headed by irrealis verbs, we see that the same
construction is used for the negation of a future event, but then with a
verbal clause headed by a finite future verb. Thus, we get the following
paradigm, again with autonomous nasals rendered as n before =de. The
future marker e has been elided, more on which can be found in note 88 at
Table 28 below.

asymmetry, within the domain of irrealis forms, between positive sentences
and negative sentences when we consider their relation to mood. The
relation between finiteness and mood in positive sentences was discussed in
2.3.1.4 above: finite future forms only allow for a declarative reading, while
semifinite forms are used for optative modality, volitive modality (strong
intention) or may even have a declarative-affirmative reading; see the
second column in the table below.","[136, 137]"
"2.7 Verbs combined with polar question particles
ka or a xajo
Drabbe 1957: section 17, page 9; section 45, page 17-18Parallel to what we saw for negative polarity in the previous section, polar
questions are also formed by the use of elements that have a predicative
function. The following table compares the strategies of forming polar
questions in nominal, adjectival and verbal clauses.",[141]
"4.2.5 Questions
Drabbe 1957: section 17, p. 9Interrogative nominal clauses are formed by means of the question particleka, as in (492), or by means of sentence final da xajo, where da is analyzed
as a copula, and xajo as a question particle, as in (493) and (494).209 The
optional use of the case markers te ‘NOM’ and the focus marker ke ‘FOC’ is
analogous to what was described for the affirmative counterparts.

for the negation of present and past events. Sentence (51) is an example of
the use of this construction in the text corpus:

(more on which can be read in 2.6), for negative future conditionals one
uses the verbal nouns under discussion here. However, to form a negative
conditional predicate, one does not use the copula xo, but the N1SG irrealis
form of the verb ki(k) ‘become’, as is illustrated in (52) and (53).","[80, 81]"
"5.5.1 Simple conditional sentences
Drabbe 1957:23aSimple, positive conditional sentences consist of an imperative or semifinite
irrealis clause that forms the protasis, and a future clause that forms the
apodosis. (575) through (577) are examples with a semifinite protasis, while
(578) exemplifies the use of an imperative. Note that (578) differs only
minimally from (577).

Drabbe 1957:23a)Negative conditional sentences are formed by the use of a negated verbal
noun which is predicated by the use of ki(k) ‘become’. This was illustrated
in (52) and (53) above (section 2.3.2.2.9 on verbal nouns in negative
sentences), and is repeated here as (579) and (580), respectively:

Drabbe (1957): section 58, p. 23Counterfactual conditional sentences are marked by a marker fini + copulaoxo in the final position of the protasis. Although Drabbe refers to fini as
an irrealis marker, I will gloss it as CFT ‘counterfactual’, to avoid the
suggestion that fini would combine with irrealis verbs; in fact, in all casesfini combines with realis verbs. There is a certain ‘logic’ to the use of a
realis, in that fini combines with verbs that refer to events that could in
principle have been actualized — this is expressed by the use of realis inthe verbal clause — but in fact have not — this is expressed by the use ofthe counterfactual marker plus copula oxo. The structure of the protasis is
analogous to the structure of negative clauses and interrogative clauses
(discussed in 2.6, 2.7 and especially 4.6), as is clear from a comparison of
the following clauses, where NgCFT stands for negative counterfactual.

counterfactual clauses

"118PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
‘I didn’t come’ (Drabbe: 1957:17)In cases like this, one could state that the entire clause is predicated over
and negated. We have a complete verbal clause dade ‘I come’, which is
embedded in a negative clause. The syntactic and semantic structure of this
clause (not considering fede) could be rendered as follows:
Syntactic structure[[dade]VERBAL CLAUSE =dèSemantic structure[[I come]xo ]NEGATIVE CLAUSEit is not] -> ‘It is not (the case that): I
come’Figure 7: verbal clause embedded in a negative clauseIt should be noted that the negator is syntactically independent of the verb.
Therefore this book deviates from Drabbe, in rendering the formative =de
as a clitic instead of a suffix. The form of verb +clitic is fully regular, with
autonomous nasals rendered as n before =de, as in (semifinite realis:) da-d-oan=dè [come-1.RLS-1PL=NEG] ‘we come’, so that we get the following
paradigms:

chains
If we study the text corpus as published in Drabbe (1957), it is clear that for
Drabbe, Aghu clauses generally combine into larger units: A sentence,
marked by a capital at the beginning and a full stop in the end, often
comprises more than one clause. Some sentences are subdivided
orthographically into smaller units by the use of semicolons or comma’s.","[323, 324, 325]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure289Example (480) has been taken from another text. In the passage preceding
the sentences below, it has been narrated how the father’s daughter
Okudukake has put pieces of sago cake all over the place. When the father
comes home, he concludes — as narrated in (479) — that his daughter must
have been eating sago, and that, see (480), the sago must be very good. The
adjective is modified twice, both by isiom(u) and by püsiü.

Drabbe 1957: section 15, p. 8Numeral clauses are formed fully analogous to adjectival clauses, with
either oxo or de as a copula. Here too, in case the copula is de, the
predicative numeral can be marked for focus (by ke) or for nominative case
(by te), the latter only in case the subject is a larger animal or human. Thus,
in (481) the predicate can only be marked for focus, while in
also the nominative marker te can be used, in case reference is made to
humans or larger animals.

Drabbe 1957: section 16, p. 8-9Nonverbal clauses are negated by the use of clause final de xo ‘NEG COP’,
as in (483) and (484) below.

(484)nan-eto(ke / te )dexo1SGLNK-father(FOC/NOM)NEGCOP‘it is not my father’ (Drabbe 1957:9a)Note that the negative particle de is homophonous with the copula de
discussed above; as set out in 3.6, both have developed from an emphatic
marker *de. Adjectival clauses are negated in the same way as nominal
clauses; an example is given in (485). Drabbe does not discuss the negation
of numeral clauses.

well as in the optional negator fede.)
Drabbe describes the negated semifinite forms as ‘negative optatives’ and
gives the following examples. Unfortunately, no additional examples were
attested.

(137)amsexobüsiüaxi-nàŋ=guòxochildrenDSThousego_II-N1PL=NEGCOP‘do not let the children go home’ (Drabbe 1957:14b)Drabbe gives only few illustrations of negated finite future forms. With the
following example he illustrates that negated future forms are also used for
expressing “a not being allowed”:
(138)siüfed’axij-exo1SGNEGdie_II[1SG]=NEGCOP‘I am not allowed to eat bananas’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)He uses the examples below to illustrate that instead of the future forms
“one likes to use, if this matches the meaning of the sentence”, a negativeverbal noun plus mũ ‘not want’, so that (139) and (140) can be used in the
same situation:
(139)axi=dexogo_II[1SG]=NEGCOP‘I will not go’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)
(140)axi-n=demu-ne / madüego_II-VN=NEGnot.want-1.RLS[SG] / not.want_II[1SG]‘I do not want to go / I shall not want to go’ (Drabbe 1957:17b)PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs123Other examples of negative volitives are the following:
(141)adi-n=demuŋ-ge-nãeat_II-VN=NEGnot.want-N1.RLS-N1PL‘they do not want to eat’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)

Drabbe 1957:16b)Note that the examples above contain a negative marker de, in spite of the
fact that the verb mũ has a negative meaning in itself (cf. 2.3.2.2.10).
Instead of a verbal noun, one may also use a negative future form. Thus,
(143) below has the same meaning as (141) above:
(143)adi-nan- Ø=-demuŋ-ge-nãeat_II-N1PL-FUT=NEGnot.want-N1.RLS-N1PL‘they do not want to eat’ (Drabbe 1957:16b)For the use of nonfinite munuk as an adverb, see section 5.7.","[139, 140, 141]"

As is common in many Papuan languages, Awyu-Dumut languages make
elaborate use of tail-head linkage. In this discourse strategy, the last clause
of a clause chain or sentence is partially or completely repeated at the
beginning of the next clause chain (cf. de Vries 2005:363). Consider the
passage below, which illustrates a number of important principles.
First, the majority of head clauses that pick up the tail clause of the
preceding clause chain or sentence are nonfinite SS forms, chained to thePART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations343following clause.253 Examples are akusunuk in (591), kunuk in (595) andgünd in (596). This pattern is in line with the observation by de Vries that
“the default form of the recapitulated head clause follows from the defaultor unmarked form of clause linkage in that language” (de Vries 2005:372;
2006:817). Another technique is to repeat the final verb of the tail literally,
something we see in the case of güŋge in (594). Third, it can be seen that
tail-head linkage is an optional and ‘creative’ process. In (592) we see that
the sequence of sentences that is linked by tail-head linkage is interrupted
by the semifinite verb akusuŋge, a form that was also used as the final verb
of (590). Following this, the verb onok in (593) picks up the tail of (591),
after which we find a further sequence of tail-head linked sentences. Not
illustrated here but attested elsewhere in the text corpus are cases where
also the object noun of a preceding sentence is repeated, or cases where the
last two clauses are repeated. 254 These phenomena show that tail-head
linkage should be seen as a discourse strategy or discourse preference,
rather than as part of sentence grammar (de Vries 2005:364).

All Awyu-Dumut languages have chained tail-head linkage. Most of them
also have thematic tail-head linkage, where the ‘head’ is closed off by a thematic marker.
Aghu, however, only has chained tail-head linkage, as it does not have thematic markers.
254(Possible) examples of the repetition of an object noun are found in 1.047-1.048; 1.057-1.058; 1.091-1.092; 1.150-1.151; 1.53-54; 1.177-78. An example of the repetition of twoclauses is found in the heads abu dadek in 1.165, ab’suke in 1.166, andpemoxo midik in

realis verb, we find analogous constructions with a nonfinite irrealis verb,
or — in other words — a verbal noun (cf. 2.3.2.2):

realis form (as in (435)), or a verbal noun (which is a nonfinite irrealis

As will be set out in Chapter 4, Aghu has two copulas: de is used as a
copula in nominal, adjectival or numeral clauses, while the use of oxo is
restricted to adjectival and numeral clauses. De is homophonous with the
negation particle de, discussed in 2.6, and with a locative particle de,
mentioned briefly in 3.4.2. I will follow up on Wester’s suggestion that the
negator de and the copula de both derive from an emphatic marker de
(Wester 2014: 127-128),193 and would like to suggest that also locative de
derives from the use of de as an emphatic copula. The development from a
copula into a locative may have taken place via a cleft construction, along a
path illustrated in the examples below:193Wester speaks of ‘an emphatic marker de with copula function in Aghu’, but does notmake explicit why she considers it as emphatic; Drabbe refers to de in these cases as a
predicative element, and never speaks about emphasis. That de used to have an emphatic
function, however, is rather likely. First, the element is found as an emphatic marker with
copular function in the related Awyu languages Pisa and Shiaxa. In addition, both the
development from emphatic markers into negative markers and from negative markers into
copulas have been described in the literature. The first development is mentioned by Croft
1991:5 (as cited in Wester 2014:128), while the development from emphatic markers to
copula markers is suggested by Pustet (2003:59), who writes that “another hint at the
origin of copulas lies in the fact that copulas are sometimes homonymous with elements
conveying certain pragmatic notions, such as emphasis.”","[285, 286, 287]"
"2.3.2.2.8 With a numeral verb
Drabbe 1957: section 40, p. 16aVerbal nouns are used in combination with numeral verbs, as in the
following examples (more on numeral verbs can be found in 2.9 and

"4 Clause structureThis chapter discusses the structure of clauses. The focus of the chapter is
on main independent clauses: those clauses that can stand on their own, and
need not be followed by another clause in order to be grammatical; in Aghu
this category is formed by clauses headed by semifinite and finite verbs
(and nonverbal clauses). Some attention will also be given, however, to
clauses headed by nonfinite verbs. These clauses cannot stand on their own
and need to be followed by another clause in order to form a grammatical
sentence.
A clause can be defined as “the linguistic expression of a proposition”
(Payne 1997:71). In the present study, a verbal clause may contain
maximally one inflected verb: a nonfinite, semifinite or fully finite verb.
Sequences of verbs within one sentence are referred to as ‘clause chains’ or
even sequences of clause chains, more on which can be found in Chapter 5.
The first section of this chapter discusses verbal clauses (with the exception
of those headed by the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’), while the second
section deals with nonverbal clauses: nominal, adjectival and numeral
clauses. The second section closes with a section on clauses headed by the
copula verb ki(k). The remainder of the chapter will deal with a number of
other phenomena that operate at clause level. Section 4.6, finally, will
summarize the similarities and differences between the types of clauses that
were discussed: verbal and non-verbal positive, negative and question
clauses.","[288, 289]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes159Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:
(186)efen-etoefen-amoko3SGLNK-father3SGLNK-son‘father and son’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)
(187)efen-amoefen-agã3SGLNK-husband3SGLNK-wife‘husband and wife’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 4.003)
(188)efeküdaefen-ēxo3SGyounger.sibling3SGLNK-elder.brother‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:
(189)ãŋgokuwomanandman‘man and woman’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)3.1.5 Number
Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to160PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesmake clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:
“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,men.””121Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.
As stated above, nouns and noun phrases are generally not specified for
number. In line with Jakobson’s wording we may say that Aghu speakers
do not have to specify nouns and noun phrases for number. In these cases,
it is the linguistic or extralinguistic context which guides the interpretation.
Thus, in (190) and (191) it is knowledge of the world (that is: the
extralinguistic context) which makes that reference is made to a single
river, and to multiple fish traps.","[176, 177, 178]"
"62 This is confirmed by what Drabbe writes when dealing with the use of future in
negative volitionals (Drabbe 1957:16, cf. also the end of section 2.6, and the examples
(35), (54a) and (56a), to which we referred in 2.3.3.2 above). Here he points out that the
future is also used in other “subjective utterances”, e.g. in xamiki fime-je [true
think_II[1SG]-FUT ] ‘I believe it is true’. Interestingly, it is precisely the more subjective
moods which according to Dik operate at the level of the entire proposition. Compare also
2.127.",[98]
"2.3.2.3.1 Predication with oxo or ki for expressing be about to
Drabbe 1957: section 35, p. 15bThe augmented verbal noun can form a predicate in combination with oxo
or ki, parallel to what was described for the non-augmented infinitive
above. Compared to the analogous construction with the non-augmented
verbal nouns, which expresses a state, the augmented verbal noun adds the
meaning aspect of being about to enter into a state. According to Drabbe,
the meaning is the same as the meaning of inflected auxiliary mV ‘do’ plus
non-augmented verbal noun described in 2.3.2.2.5 above. He gives the
following three examples. In constructions with ki(k) ‘become’, the verbki(k) should be taken as ‘getting into the state of’, so that the predicate in asentence like (59) should be understood as ‘getting into a state of almost
dying’.

following two examples.

As indicated in Table 2 above, fully finite verbs can be distinguished from
semifinite verbs by the presence of tense markers. Stems of type I can be
specified for different past tenses, while stems of type II can be specified
for future tense.","[84, 85]"
"2.11 Mũ not want
Drabbe 1957: section 90, p. 36a-bThe verb mũ 'not want' has been mentioned at several places in this chapter.
In 2.3.2.2 it was introduced as heading a verbal noun. In the same section,
as well as in 2.5, we saw the imperative forms of mũ used in the expressionPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs143of negative commands. The form was also mentioned in section 2.6 on
negation. Here we want to focus on the nonfinite form munuk, a form about
which Drabbe writes that “in Dutch one very often translates as ‘after’, andwhich often does not mean more than that.” 106 Consider the following
examples:
(173)Soxokunukmunukbüsiüdaxenã.soxokũ-nu-kmũ-nu=kbüsiüda-xe-nãgroundput-SS-CONnot.want-SS=CONhousecome-N1.RLS-N1PL‘After having hidden the blood in the ground, they come home.’ (1.015)

away.’ (6.129)In the examples above, the sense of ‘not wanting (anymore)’ fades into a‘not continuing with’. Although Drabbe’s remark might be taken as an
indication that the form has grammaticalized into an adverb, there are
insufficient reasons to analyze the form as such. In all the examples, the
form can still be analyzed as a same-subject nonfinite verb form, as it is
virtually always followed by a verb with the same subject as the subject ofmũ. This suggests that this is still a grammatical requirement, which
directly follows from the analysis of munuk as a nonfinite SS-form.","[160, 161]"

Drabbe 1957: sections 78-88, p.31-36Following Drabbe, who devotes 11 sections to the verbs ba(x) ‘sit’, e(k)‘stand’, and i(g) ‘lie’, this book also devotes a separate section to thediscussion of posture verbs. Following a brief introduction about irregular
inflections, section 2.8.1 offers a discussion of the meaning and use of
posture verbs as lexical verbs. Section 2.8.2 shows instances where posture
verbs are developing into a copula, but where the meaning aspect of posture
is still part of their lexical entry. Section 2.8.3, finally, considers several
other types of verbs derived from posture verbs and their uses.
While e(k) ‘stand’ and i(g) ‘lie’, and their stem_II counterparts ie and ai,
have fully regular paradigms, ba(x) ‘sit’ sometimes has o or u instead of aas final vowel of the stem. This is true for the following places in the
paradigm:PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs129Table 32: Irregular forms of ba(x) ‘sit’ (from Drabbe 1957:31-32)Semifinite realis

that here we have to do with a formative ku and a formative oxo, where the
latter can be functionally and formally equated to the predicator (o)xo that
is also used in the other negative constructions. The formative ku, which
given the analogy to the negator de in the other forms is synchronically
analyzed as a negator, can probably be historically related to the emphatic
marker ku ‘EMP’ that we find in emphatic pronouns, cf. section 3.2.1. This
would make the development of ku analogous to what Wester describes for
the negator de (Wester 2014: 131-32). Citing Croft (1991:5) on the sources
of verbal negators, she convincingly argues that the negator de that is found
in several Awyu languages has an emphatic marker de as its source (which88It is noteworthy that the verb forms in this column could, formally, also be analyzed assemifinite forms, with assimilation of the final autonomous nasal (in all forms except 1SG)
to the following alveolar. Drabbe, however, analyzes the forms as finite forms in which the
final e of the future marker is elided. I will follow Drabbe at this point for two reasons.
First, analyzing the forms in =kuoxo as semifinites and those in the first column as finites
makes sense from a paradigmatic point of view, and is in line with the function of the two
forms. Both in positive sentences and in negative sentences we then have finite and
semifinite forms, with the finite forms associated (primarily) with indicative-declarative
mood, and the semifinites with other types of mood — see Table 27 above. Second, we
find an analogous elision of final future e in the interrogative forms discussed in 2.7
(which are forms that cannot be analyzed as semifinite forms, see the discussion there).
The forms should, therefore, be analyzed as ade-Ø=dè xo [hear_II[1SG]-FUT=NEG COP] ‘Iwill not hear’etc.","[138, 139]"
"Fede is the word used for ‘nothing’ (cf. 391 below) and also used as a negative marker,cf. section 4.2.4, so that the clause reads as ‘there is no hair’.
261kop; hoofdElsewhere Drabbe writes kinoxo. Cf. oxo ‘water’.",[378]
"VolitiveSemifinitemũ ‘not want’ plus complement clause
OptativeSemifinite, negated with =kuoxoIn negative sentences, on the other hand, we find a somewhat different
relation between form and mood or modality. As can be seen in the
rightmost column of the table above, we have dedicated forms or
constructions for declarative, volitive and optative readings. The rest of this
section will first discuss form and function of the finite forms, then come to
the form and function of the semifinite forms with =kuoxo and close off
with some words on the construction with mũ ‘not want’.
The form of negated fully finite forms was given in Table 26 above. In the
table below, the (constructions with) negated fully finite forms are
compared to (constructions with) negated semifinite forms.",[138]

In section 2.5 it is described that imperatives cannot be negated, and
that the imperative forms of mũ 'not.want' are used (usually combined
with a verbal noun or a future) as a way to form negative commands. Here
Drabbe writes in a note that 'do not want', should be taken as 'do not

Drabbe 1957: section 42, p. 16bIn line with its use in negation, described in the previous paragraph, the
verbal noun is also used as complement of the verb mũ ‘refuse / not.want’.
Interestingly, the verbal noun is followed by =de NEG, so that we formally
have to do with double negation. Analogous to what we saw in
constructions with the auxiliary mV ‘do’ in 2.3.2.2.5 above (which express
intention), here it is also possible to use a finite future instead of a verbal
noun, so that both (54a) and (b) are acceptable. In cases like this, the stress
on the verb is prefinal, so that the final future suffix -e is often elided.

Drabbe 1957: sections 35-36, p. 15bVerbal nouns can be augmented with a vowel a that bears primary stress,
resulting in forms like axinà ‘come_II.VN’, where the autonomous nasal
survives as n. Augmented verbal nouns are found in the following contexts.","[81, 82, 83, 84]"
"284The notion of killing is usually expressed by a sequence of two mini clauses, the firstexpressing the notion of ‘hitting’, the second the notion of dying, cf. note at 7.004 (in the
tekst edition).
285Whereas Drabbe gives the noun ‘bellyache’ as a translation, the spelling okiame-,ending in a hyphen, suggests that okiame- is a verb in -mV, just like xaime in 126 (cf.
section 2.1 and 2.2, Table 3, type c). In that case, the verbal expression ‘have a bellyache’
would probably be a more correct rendering of the meaning of the word.

"The quote above summarizes the main point: clauses headed by less
inflected verbs depend for their interpretation on the next fully inflected
verb to their right, but are at the same time not a constituent of the clause
containing the fully inflected verb. Following Foley (2010), these clauses
are probably better characterized as coordinate rather than subordinate.223
223It is not so easy to prove, however, that the dependent clauses in Aghu are coordinaterather than subordinate. According to Foley (2010), subordinate clauses are always
constituents of the main clause: either as a core argument, in which case they are
complement clauses; or as oblique arguments, in which case they are adverbial subordinate
clauses, or as modifier of a nominal constituent, in which case they are relative clauses.
One could state, therefore, that subordinate clauses, are ‘nominalized’, or — generally —
formally marked as noun phrases.
While in certain other Awyu-Dumut languages dependent clauses can be contrasted with
subordinate structures in which the clause is nominalized (cf. Wester 2014: 158 f.; de Vries
2005:372-377), this is not the case in Aghu; it is impossible to use language-internal
criteria to contrast the dependent clauses under discussion here with subordinate clauses.
Still, it makes more sense to consider them coordinate rather than subordinate. The main
reasons for this are the following: (1) There is simply no evidence that the clauses are
embedded in the following clause with fully inflected verb, and there is no evidence that
the clauses are nominalized (unless we follow Drabbe’s analysis of ke, see below); (2)
Drabbe never translates the dependent clauses in Aghu as complement clauses or relative
clauses, which — as stated by Foley 2010:32 — are typical functions of subordinate
clauses in Papuan languages. Although it is true that translations can never be taken as
evidence for the existence or non-existence of a certain grammatical construction, I
nevertheless believe that the total lack of relative and complement clauses in the Dutch
translation is telling; (3) although Drabbe refers to the nonfinite forms as deelwoordenPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations3135.4 Aghu and switch reference
As stated in the previous section, switch reference systems typically appear
in clause-chaining languages. As argued in de Vries (2010), who modifies a
theory set out in in Haiman and Munro (1983), clause chaining structures
are the result of coordination reduction in thematic continuity conditions,
where the basic principle is that those operators that are consistent over the
clauses are marked only on the verb of the final clause. De Vries shows
how, for Dumut languages, reduction took place in a diachronic process, in
cases where the operators of tense, mood and subject of a series of clauses
were continuous. In this process, verbs in SS conditions were the first to be
reduced and to become part of a chaining structure. Present Dumut
languages show the traces of this diachronic process: All Dumut languages
have dedicated nonfinite SS forms, which lack a specification for tense,
mood and person, while only some have dedicated DS forms. These DS
forms have grown from the non-reduced forms when used as non-final verb
in a series of clauses; as the use of reduced forms was restricted to SS
conditions, the non-reduced forms came to be associated with DS conditions.
In Dumut languages, then, we find (apart from the tensed forms which(‘participles’), he places the words in apostrophes to show that they are different from
participles. The difference may very well be that participles are embedded while nonfinites
are not; (4) There are very clear cases where nonfinite clauses present foreground
information, e.g. in the durative constructions discussed in Durative aspect expressed by
constructions with posture verbs and at the end of 5.4.1.1. This is very unusual for
subordinate structures (cf. Dooley 2010). With regard to the first point, it should be noted
that the connective =k that is optionally used after nonfinites is considered by Drabbe the
same as the oblique marker ke used after nouns. Although it cannot be excluded that there
is a diachronic connection between the two particles, I believe that the two particles
synchronically have very different functions. The use of =k after nonfinite verbs cannot
be used, therefore, as an argument that the nonfinite clause would have been nominalized,
and that it would, therefore, be in a subordinate relation to the final clause.","[330, 331]"

the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).
This adaptation has been written as part of the project The Awyu Dumutfamily of Papuan languages in its linguistic and cultural context. In this
project the different languages that are part of the Greater Awyu language
group have been compared, and documented in more detail.5 At times, I
have made reference to other publications that have resulted from this
project, especially where new insights shed light on analytical problems
within Aghu.
Great care has been taken to indicate clearly in the text where my analysis
differs from Drabbe’s. At the same time, in order to enhance the
comparison between this book and the original, each section closes with a
list of references to the corresponding sections in Drabbe (1957). The
structure of this book follows that of Drabbe: Part I, consisting of chapters5This project took place at the VU University of Amsterdam, and was supported by De NederlandseOrganisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, reference number 380-89-020.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

marker. I would like to suggest, however, that examples like (437) above
may have originally started out as cleft constructions with an emphaticcopula de, and would originally better have been translated as ‘it is motherwho is sitting there’, with napi ‘mother’ as a ‘focused subject’, or — more
strictly formulated: a focused NP coreferent with the implicit subject ofbaxe. In the course of time, the emphatic function of de bleached, after
which it was reinterpreted as an adverbial locative marker, and could also
be used in contexts without a ‘focused subject’, as in (438).194,195

preceded by fede. Consider the following example.

"The locative marker de seems, therefore, mutually exclusive with focus on
the location. The same principle might explain why the locative marker isPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs137also lacking when posture verbs are combined with demonstratives, which
is the topic of this section. 100,101
Drabbe writes that the notion of ‘being present’ can be expressed bycombining a demonstrative element (nego ‘THIS’, xo ‘DST’ or ü ‘there’)
with the durative form of posture verbs. The demonstrative element directly
precedes the verb, and for a number of demonstrative-verb combinations
the language has developed contracted forms. Table 35 shows the forms for
combinations of posture verbs with nego ‘THIS’, where it should be noted
that nigi is used instead of nego.102100This explanation is based on the assumption that there is a positive correlation betweendemonstrative deixis and focus: demonstratives will usually be focused and therefore not
be followed by de. By frequency of association, what starts off as a tendency:
demonstratives are usually not followed by de, may grow into a grammatical restriction:
demonstratives cannot be followed by de, but directly precede the verb. That
demonstratives frequently precede the verb is proven by the existence of the contracted
forms under discussion here.
101It should be noted that locative verbs may easily bring along a focus on the clause as awhole, which Lambrecht describes as ‘presentational’ or ‘thetic’ focus (1994: 141,
168,233). An example of a thetic focus in this context would be a sentence like ‘there’smother sitting there’, where the whole sentence is an assertion, or ‘new information’. In
order to decide whether the verbs under discussion here bring along this reading, however,
we would need examples of the use of these sentences in daily conversation.
102Although Drabbe might be right in his suggestion that nigi is a contracted form of negoand the durative prefix -i, it is remarkable that except from here, durative i- and
durative -ke are never used simultaneously.","[154, 155]"

o-xodeda-despeak-N1.RLS[SG]COPcome-1.RLS[SG]‘I came because he asked me’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)Drabbe contrasts the sentence above to (509) below, where one uses the
different-subject marker -ne. Compared to (509), sentence (508) stresses the
reason or the ground for coming: it is because he asked me that I came.
(509)o-xo-neda-despeak-N1.RLS[SG]-DScome-1.RLS[SG]‘he asked me and I came’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)I follow Drabbe in analyzing de as a copula.213 As the number of examples
given by Drabbe is limited, and as we have only few examples of this
construction in the text corpus, it is hard to characterize the precise function
of this construction. It can at least be said that speakers may embed verbal
clauses of different moods, including content questions. In (510)-(512) and
(515) we find realis verbal clauses (serving as an assertion), while (513) is
an example of an embedded irrealis. In (514) we have to do with a (realis)
content question (more on which will be said below). Example (516) and
(517), finally, are examples of embedded imperative clauses. In order to
clarify the structure of the clauses, I have given both a translation that
follows the Aghu structure quite closely, and a more liberal rendering.

few. A clear example is found in the myth on the two brothers, where the
younger brother commands his brother twice to let loose of his scrotum.
(518)nēxo,midikenaden-ēxomi-di=kenade1SG-elder.brothercome.down-SS=CONstand.IMP[SG]COP‘my elder brother, you [let loose and] come down and stand’ (3.140, repeated
in 3.158)In order to better grasp the function of embedding verbal clauses in copula
clauses ending in de, it is important to note that the copula here stands in a
paradigmatic relation with negative de xo ‘NEG COP’; with interrogative ka /(a)xajo ‘QST’, and with counterfactual fini oxo ‘CFT COP’, more on which
can be found in 5.5.2. Especially informative is the contrast between open
questions and polar questions. Open questions begin with a question word,
and are optionally embedded in a copula clause ending in de, as illustrated
in (514) above, and (519) below. Closed or polar questions, however, are
embedded in clauses ending in ka or (a)xajo, as can be seen in (520)
(519)makumaxì-n-edehow/where/whengo_II-N1SG-FUTCOP‘(it is:) where will you go?’ (Drabbe 1957:40a)

questioned, here we have a given state of affairs, in which it is one
information gap that is emphasized. 214 Two further examples of verbal

contrast.

As was stated in 3.1.7 and 3.6, there are good reasons to analyze te and ke
as case markers. Here I will defend this analysis, but show that they also
have a pragmatic function, which I tentatively describe as ‘focused’. I will
also explain why I analyze ke in certain contexts as a focus marker rather
than a case marker.
expected to take place. The use of ka or axajo puts in question whether the event has taken
place, is taking place or will take place. One might say that the use of de implies a high
degree of authority from the side of the speaker for the truth of the proposition, while polar
questions hand the authority for the truth of the proposition over to the addressee. Cf.
Timberlake (2007: 315f.).
215This is the only case where I have analyzed eke as an accusative; in all other cases ithas been analyzed as a 3SG pronoun plus focus, and glossed as 3SG.FOC; cf. 3.2.3.1.","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317]"
"Elsewhere, Drabbe writes that ni is used in combination with a verbal noun
to indicate the purpose of an event (cf. 2.3.2.2.3):

(374)dugusimẽnida-xe-nãrooftwine_II.VNDATcome-N1.RLS-N1PL243‘they came to twine a roof’ (Drabbe 1957:15a)In my view, the meaning of the particle is best captured by considering it a
dative marker. The term ‘dative’ expresses the fact that the marker is used
for what one might call a-typical Patients. On the one hand, they are like
(typical) Patients, in that they are neither instigators of the event, nor is
their involvement in the event defined by by their being volitional or
sentient. On the other hand, they are atypical, because they are not affected
by the event.180 This is true for the verbs given by Drabbe (‘love’ and ‘beafraid of’), and confirmed by the distribution of ni in the text corpus. There
we find ni used to mark the complement of agu ‘seek’ (8 attestations), tomark the complement of dokũ ‘wait for’ (4 attestations), once to mark thecomplement of ogo ‘go close to’ and once to mark the complement of o(x)‘speak’; examples will be given below.","[260, 261]"
"2.4.3.2 Durative aspect expressed by use of particle bu
Drabbe 1957: section 54, p. 21-22An alternative way of expressing durative aspect is by the use of a particlebu — often cliticized as b= before vowels, and harmonizing with the
following vowel — in combination with a semifinite or finite verb, or with
one of the durative forms discussed in the previous section. The formativebu usually directly precedes the verb, but it is not a prefix, as it can be
separated from the stem, as in (92) and (93).",[112]

As will be set out in the chapter on clause combinations, clauses are
generally linked asyndetically. This means that the use of conjunctions to
connect clauses is rare. Whether this is also true for noun phrases is hard to
say, as the text corpus does not contain examples of conjoined noun
phrases, neither asyndetically, nor syndetically. In Drabbe’s description,
however, we find a presentation of both NP conjoining and clause
conjoining conjunctions. These are presented in 3.8.1 and 3.8.2,
respectively.","[272, 273]"
