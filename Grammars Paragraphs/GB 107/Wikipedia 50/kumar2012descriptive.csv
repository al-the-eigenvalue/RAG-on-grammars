"4.5.3Use of ɲagFor short responses or an answer to a yes/no question, Jarawa uses the negative
particle ɲag at the beginning of the negative response, followed by the negated
sentence. For instance, the negative response to the yes/no question given in
(4.70) would be (4.71).(4.70) ka
INTMŋa-kajapečame2POSS-motherdieHas your mother died?(4.71) ɲag
Noma-kajapečame naɖem1POSS-motherdieNEGNo, my/our mother has not died.
The suffix {-ma} can be used instead of naɖem.(4.72) ɲag
Noma-kajapečame-ma1POSS-motherdie-NEGNo, my/our mother has not died.
An affirmative response of (4.70) is presented in (4.73).",[185]
"4.5 Negative clauses
Negation in Jarawa can be expressed in two ways: either by using the
independent negative word naɖem or the suffix –ma. Both are used for clausal
negation. There is no semantic difference between the two, but the suffix –ma has
restricted use in the language while naɖem can be used across the board.",[181]
"5.4.13 Negation
Jarawa employs two strategies to express negation: either putting a negative
word at the end of a clause, or using a negative suffix to the verbs. Though the
negative word can be used in any type of clause, whether verbal or verbless, the
negative suffix is used only in verbal clauses. Examples in (5.33–5.38) illustrate213214the use of the negative word while example (5.39) demonstrates negation of the
verbal clause.
(5.33) ullel ɖəbəᵼʈʰenaɖemSeagoNEGLOCDon’t go into the sea.(5.34) tenmej

"Negative particle: It is also used with the negative particle naɖem ‘not’. {ʈʰi}is employed with negative particle when the negative particle is used for a short
response of a sentence or clause. This is illustrated by the example (3.120a and
3.120b).
(3.120a) ka
INTMpramodʈʰiəŋPramodCOPJarawaIs Pramod a Jarawa?(3.120b)ʈʰinaɖemCOPnotHe is not.
In (3.120a) there is a question and we get the response as in (3.120b). However, it
is not essential to get the question like (3.120a) everytime, and hence the meaning
of the sentence can be derived from the context in which the conversation is
carried out.
4.",[154]
"1331343.8 Copula {ʈʰi}
The morpheme {ʈʰi} has various usages in this language. It is used for identifying
an entity, or to qualify a noun. This morpheme also comes with the negative
particle, if the negative particle is used for short responses. It is also used with
spatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morpheme appears with verbs
when the verb is used in adverbial relation to the main verb. Based on the
different usages of {ʈʰi}, it can be termed a copula in this language.
Unlike the verb which follows the object, this copula precedes the nominal
predicates or adjectival predicates. Jarawa is an SOV language. The expected
word order is noun, then nominal predicate or adjectival predicate, followed by
copula. However, the copula is used between the subject and the nominal
predicate or adjectival predicate.","[151, 152]"
"169170Morphological negation may also be used, i.e. the suffix {-ma}. (4.80)
demonstrates the use of negative suffix {-ma} in prohibitives.(4.80) ullel ɖəbəᵼʈʰe-maseago-NEGLOCDon’t go in the sea.","[187, 188]"
"4.6.2Prohibitive clausesProhibitives are a kind of command, order, or advice to not to do something. In
Jarawa, these are formed by putting the negative element naɖem after the verb,
like it happens in simple negative sentences.
(4.79) ullel
seaɖəbəᵼʈʰenaɖemLOCgoNEGDon’t go in the sea.",[187]
"224225Two kinds of causative constructions, morphological and syntactic, were found.
Morphological causatives are formed by prefixing causative prefix {wa-} to verbs.
Limited data suggested that morphological causative is employed to a handful of
verbs, and the syntactic causative across the board. In syntactic causatives, the
independent word is used to express causation along with the lexical verb.
In the adjective category, this language was observed to demonstrate descriptive
adjectives, numerals, and demonstratives. Descriptive adjectives consist of words
related to colour terms or which define, describe, and qualify nouns. Also found
was marking of the degree of adjectives. In degrees of comparison positive,
comparative, and superlative degrees are attested. The positive degree is formed
by the noun phrase and adjective. The comparative degree was seen to be
expressed syntactically. In the comparative degree, the standard of comparison
was observed to precede the marker of comparison, and the adjective to follow
the marker of comparison. Superlative degree was seen as formed by employing
the intensifier or a completely new word which was not found to have any
resemblance with the adjective of positive degree.
Adverb was also found as a separate word class. These are lexical items used as
intensifiers, temporal adverbs, and spatial adverbs. No morphological
derivational process was confirmed to form adverbs from adjectives.
No syntactic case marking was observed in this language. However, two
morphemes were attested as postpositions to express semantic case. These
morphemes were {ɖə} and {ɲačʰe}. The morpheme {ɖə} has multiple functions in
this language. This morpheme was found to express place of location, source of
location, and goal of location. It was also frequently found with temporal and225226spatial adverbs, but not always. The morpheme {ɲačʰe} expresses the
commitative.
The morpheme {ʈʰi} was identified as copula. This copula is used to identify an
entity or qualify a noun. It was also seen employed with negative particles and
with temporal and spatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morpheme
was also seen with verbs which were performing the function of adverbs. The
corpus suggested that this copula does not take inflection, but one example was
found where it was inflected for mood.
Four word formation processes were confirmed. These word formation processes
were compounding, denominalisation, reduplication, and the use of empty
morpheme. In compounding, three combinations were substantiated: nounnoun, noun-adjective, and noun-noun-adjective. In the denominalisation process,
we saw that nouns are denominalised to verbs with the help of a suffix. In
reduplication,Jarawademonstratessyllablereduplicationandwordreduplication. As for word reduplication, the corpus suggested that verbs were
reduplicated to serve the function of adverbial modifiers.
A notable phenomenon was also observed under word formation processes: a
morpheme used mostly with personal nouns (but also other nouns) was
discussed, but the meaning of this morpheme was not clear. Hence this
morpheme was referred to as an empty morpheme.
In syntax, the different syntactic structures of Jarawa, and their variances were
discussed. These syntactic structures included simple clause structures,
interrogative constructions, imperative sentences, negative constructions, and226227cleft constructions. It was also observed that this language follows the ergativeabsolutive system.
In declarative sentences, verbless and verbal clauses were discussed. Verbless
clauses consisted of non-verbal predicates like nouns and adjectives as the heads
of clauses. Copula constructions were also included in verbless clauses. Verbal
clauses contained verbs as heads of main clauses.
In verbless clauses we encountered two different types of clauses: one type had a
nominal as the head of the predicate, and another had an adjective as the head of
the clause. Verbless clauses also included copula constructions, since the use of
copula constructions were mostly observed in this type. In verbless clauses with
a nominal as head, two constructions were discussed: one where the S argument
was a pronominal headed NP and another where it was a lexically headed NP.
Lexical NPs were found to take copula constructions while pronominal headed
NPs never take copula constructions.
In verbless clauses with adjectival predicates, three kinds of constructions were
discussed. One was with prefixation of a pronominal S argument in adjectival
predicates beginning with a vowel, and which never takes a copula. The second
was copula constructions with a lexically headed NP as S argument which take a
copula. The third was adjectival predicates suffixed for state/evidentiality, which
also do not take the copula.
In verbal clauses there were four kinds of constructions discussed. These were
intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and constructions with denominalised verbs.
All these constructions were found to have different structures.","[242, 243, 244, 245]"
"228229To express negation, this language makes use of an independent word naɖem
after a predicate (verbal or verbless), or a suffix -ma on a verb. There was no
semantic difference observed between the two. We saw that the independent
word naɖem could be used across the board while the suffix -ma had restricted
use.
Imperatives are formed by using the verb with its core argument. As we saw,
there is no morphological marking to differentiate imperatives from other kinds
of sentences.
In interrogatives, we looked at yes/no questions and wh-questions, which differ
syntactically. Yes/no questions are formed by placing the interrogative marker ka
at the beginning of a clause, while in wh-questions the wh-word occupied its situ
position. The use of the interrogative marker with some wh-questions was also
found.
In the category of complex sentences, I explored coordination and complement
clauses. A conjunction ən ‘and’ was found to be used to express coordination. In
coordinated clauses, it was found that conjunction ən ‘and’ can be employed at
phrase level and clausal level to form coordinated clauses.
Two different kinds of complement clauses were also discussed. These two types
of clauses were clause internal and clause external complement clauses. In a
clause internal complement clause, the complement clause occurs within the
main clause in the object position of the verb phrase. Clause external
complement clauses were described as instances of direct speech in this
language. Since the language was found to be SOV, meaning the object occupies229230the slot before verb, these kinds of constructions were considered as clause
external complement clauses.
Direct speech and cleft constructions were established as types of complex
constructions found in Jarawa. It was suggested that there is only direct speech
in this language (based on pronominal correlation). Cleft constructions were
found to have two sub-types: ɖi-constructions and ʈʰi-constructions. The former
suggests referential/definiteness of the entity referred to, and the latter
indefiniteness of the entity referred to.
The morpheme ɖi was shown to have two different usages in this language. One
usage is to indicate definiteness/referentiality, and the second is to express
grammatical relation. Referentiality was treated in this dissertation as applicable
when the entity referred to is within sight of the speaker-hearer. Definiteness,
then, is applicable when the entity referred to is not within sight but the speakerhearer has shared knowledge. . However, some restrictions were found on the
use of this morpheme. It never occurs with pronominals and postposed Os. It can
occur only with lexically headed S or O arguments of a clause. This morpheme
was also seen employed with interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’ and clause
internal complement clauses. In the case of the interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’,
the cleft construction is formed.
The way this morpheme is employed in this language also indicated that this
morpheme expressed grammatical relations, i.e. ergative-absolutive system. The
languageemployssplitergative-absolutivesystem.","[246, 247, 248]"
"1631644.5.1Negation with naɖemThe position of this negative element in a clause is after the predicate. To negate
a declarative clause, the structure in (4.56) is to be used.
(4.56) [subject]NP {[object]}NP Verb ]]VP [naɖem]NEG(4.57) uʈʰaallemanaɖemUʈʰacomeNEGUʈʰa did not come.","[181, 182]"
"5.5 Conclusion
This language is SOV but it deviates from the SOV patterns in many respects. A
tendency of SOV languages is to have postpositions, and this language also has a
postposition. Like some SOV languages Jarawa employs noun-adjective and
adjective-adverb patterns, but demonstratives, numerals and genitives precede
218219the nouns. In the comparative construction, the marker of comparison follows
the standard of comparison. Peripheral arguments/adpositional phrases precede
the verb. In complement clauses this language employs both the patterns,
complement clauses can occur before the verb or after the verb. The negative
particle or suffix appears at the end of clause.","[236, 237]"
"The sentence (3.99) can also mean only the phrase ‘these arrows’. It is difficult to
syntactically assess whether (3.99) is a clause or a phrase. If this phrase is
employed as a subject or an object of a clause, then it can be interpreted as a
demonstrative adjective. For instance, in example (3.100), luwə paʈʰo-le ‘those
125126arrows’ is an example of a demonstrative adjective as this entire noun phrase is
used as an object of the clause.
(3.100)luwəpaʈʰo-leDEM-Aarrow-PLɖ-eŋge
REF-bringBring those arrows.
3.5.3Degree of adjectivesJarawa differentiates between degrees of comparison. The language displays
positive, comparative, and superlative degrees. The degree of comparison is not
expressed morphologically. Rather, syntactic strategies are employed to express
degree of comparison. Positive degree is formed by using noun and adjective,
illustrated by (3.101).","[143, 144]"
"There is one example in the corpus which shows that the question particle may
be used in between the noun phrase and the question word. In example (5.49)
cajwaj ‘name of a girl’ is a noun phrase and ʈʰucəʈəgə ‘where’ is a question word,
and question particle comes in between the two. The example given in (5.49) can
be articulated without question particle as given in (5.50). It is surprising that
here the question particle cannot be used in the beginning of the sentence; the
use of question particle at the beginning of the clause in (5.51) makes the
sentence ungrammatical.

Caywaykaʈʰučəʈəgə?",[235]
"Inthecaseofdefiniteness/referentiality this morpheme was usually employed with S or O. The
use of the morpheme with A was rare if S or O were found to be230231definite/referential. Thus, this morpheme conveyed grammatical relations in the
context of definiteness/referentiality. With an indefinite object this morpheme
was not employed with S, O, or A.
Typologically, this language was found to be SOV. Postpositions were found.
Descriptive adjectives and manner of adverbs follow the head while numerals
and demonstratives precede the head. In the comparative degree, the marker of
comparison follows the standard of comparison. The copula precedes non-verbal
predicates in copula constructions. Negative particles or suffixes appear at the
end of the clause.","[248, 249]"

This is a general strategy to negate the clause whether it is a declarative, an
interrogative, or an imperative sentence. The examples (4.59) and (4.60) show
interrogative and imperative sentences, respectively.

164165naɖem is the only negative element which can be used in verbless clauses. The
structure of verbless clauses with naɖem is presented in (4.61). The examples
which follow demonstrate the use of naɖem in these environments. naɖem occurs
after the nominal or adjectival predicate.

"4.5.2Negation with suffix {-ma}Another way to negate the sentence in Jarawa is to employ suffix {-ma} on the
verbal predicate. But in such constructions, the verbal predicate does not take
any other suffix (for instance, modality suffixes). Thus the {-ma} suffix replaces
any other suffixal markings. Sentence (4.67) demonstrates the use of the {-ma}
suffix for negation. In this sentence, allema ‘come’ does not have any other suffix.
(4.68) is ungrammatical because allema ‘come’ bears the suffix {-hə} which does
not allow the suffix {-ma} to negate the sentence. In such cases, one has to employ
naɖem to express negation.(4.67) uʈʰaallema-maUʈʰacome-NEGUʈʰa did not come.(4.68) * uʈʰa
Uʈʰaallema-hə-ma
come-HYP-NEGUʈʰa may not come.",[184]
"Similarly in the case of suffixes, one of the suffixes denoting evidential marker,
modality marking or negative marking can attached to a verb. (3.51) and (3.52)
demonstrate the use of suffixes {-hə} and {-ma} and (3.53) and (3.54) show that
both suffixes cannot attach simultaneously.",[123]
"However, the use of the question particle in content questions is limited. Mostly
content questions are formed with the question word in situ. The examples (5.46–
5.48) illustrate the usual way of forming content questions, where question
words are employed without the question particle.",[234]
"5.4.14 Question particle
Jarawa employs the question particle in yes/no questions. However, this question
particle also has (limited) use in content questions (wh-questions). The examples
(5.40) and (5.41) demonstrate the use of the question particle in yes/no questions
of verbless clauses while examples (5.42) and (5.43) show the use in yes/no
questions of verbal clauses.

"Assertive Mood
{-jag}The assertive/emphatic marker {-jag} has two variant forms {-jag} and {-g}. The
conditioning environment for the occurrences of these two variants is
phonological. If a verb ends with the vowel /a/, the {-g} suffix will be attached to
it. {-jag} is used in all other cases. It generally indicates emphatic mood or shows
a strong assertion. For example, in sentences (3.73–3.75) it means that the speaker
emphasizes or asserts the action of giving and going.",[132]
"3.4 Verbal morphology
This section discusses verbs and verb phrases. Section 3.4.1 focuses on the verb
and its root forms. Section 3.4.2 deals with inflection and affixation related to
verbs. Causative constructions are described in 3.4.7.
3.4.1Verbs and verb rootsLike nouns, verbal roots can also be classified as free or bound. Free roots exist
independently while bound roots have an obligatory prefix. Verbs used
exclusively for human actions are generally bound roots. For example, ən-ətəhə
‘sit’ contains the prefix {ən-}, and the root ətəhə which has been recorded as mətəhə ‘I sit’, he-təhə ‘s/he sits’, and ən-ətəhə ‘you sit’. Thus ənətəhə may mean (a)
‘you sit’, or (b) ‘sit[HUMAN]’. For non-humans, the verb for ‘sit’ is oho. The {ən-}
prefix is not obligatorily for verbs used for both humans as well as non-humans.
For instance, ahapela ‘run’ is used for both and therefore does not have the {ən-}
prefix.
3.4.2Verbal affixesIn Jarawa, verbs take one prefix and one suffix. Generally, in the prefix category
are pronominals (PRO), referential/definiteness markers (REF) or co-referencing
element (COREF), while as suffix are evidentiality marker (EVD) modality ((MOOD)104105and negative marker (NEG). The structure of a verb with its affixes is presented in
(3.48).
(3.48) (PRO) (REF) (COREF) + Verb + (EVD) (MOOD) (NEG)
Only one prefix and one suffix may be attached to a verb in a clause. For
example, if a clause has both a referential/definiteness marker and co-refencial
marker, the verb may take only the co-referential marker as a prefix, and the
referential/definiteness marker occurs as a separate word, as illustrated in (3.49).","[122, 123]"

This dissertation aims to present a descriptive grammar of the Jarawa language.
Sound system, morphology and syntax of the language have been examined and
analyzed to arrive at conclusion. This study also makes an attempt to classify the
language typologically. According to Radcliff-Brown (1948), the word ‘Jarawa’
has been derived from the Aka-Bea language of the Great Andamanese group,
which meant ‘stranger’ ‘or someone who should be afraid of’. The people who
speak Jarawa belong to a hunter-gatherer community living along the western
coast of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, a part of Union Territory of India. The
term ‘Jarawa’ is used for both the language and the people/community, although
Jarawas call themselves əŋ1.
The Andaman Islands have been the home for indigenous communities
comprising of Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarawa and Sentinelese (see §1.4 for
detailed discussion). All these communities represent ‘the first Palaeolithic
colonizers of South-East Asia’ (Thangaraj et al, 2003) and ‘remained in isolation
for a longer period than any known population of the world’ (Kashyap et al,
2004). The archaeological evidence for an early occupation of Andamans is scant
because of the nomadic lifestyle of the inhabitants and the limited number of
explorations that have taken place. At present, the oldest confirmed radio-carbon1Instead of using the term əŋ for this community, I will make use of the term ‘Jarawa’ throughoutthe dissertation, because this community and their language are known worldwide by this term
for centuries. Changing the term may create confusion among readers.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"4.11 Conclusion
This chapter described the structures of verbless and verbal clause types.
Verbless clauses include structures which have two nouns in juxtaposition, or a
noun with an adjective. In verbal clauses, the focus was on clauses with verbs as
the head of predicates; they include intransitive verbs, transitive verbs,
ditransitive verbs and denominalised verbs. I also examined the various
structures forming simple clauses, such as interrogative sentences, imperative
sentences, negation, and so on. Complex sentences were also described, which
include coordinating structures and complementation. The language employs
clause internal complement clauses and clause external complement clauses.
Clause external complement clauses consist of direct speech. Relative clauses
were also discussed and the use of ʈʰi and ɖi with interrogative pronouns,
especially onne ‘who’, was clarified.",[214]
"34351.8 Organization of the present work
Chapter 2 describes the sound system of the language. This chapter begins with
the identification of sounds and their phonemic status in the language. To
establish the phonemic status of the sounds, minimal and sub-minimal pairs are
provided. Moreover, the distribution of sounds at syllable and word level is also
discussed. This chapter also investigates syllable structure and other
phonological processes found in this language.
Chapter 3 discusses the morphology of the language. This includes noun
morphology, verbal morphology, adjectives and adverbs. Copulas and
postpositions are also described. Noun morphology also deals with pronouns
and nouns, and their behaviour in the language. Verbal morphology consists of
suffixes and prefixes which are attached to the verbs, and their usage. There is
also a brief discussion on adjectives and adverbs in the same chapter.
Chapter 4 gives an account of the syntactic structure of the language. This
description includes verbless predicates and verbal predicates. This chapter also
focuses on negative constructions, interrogative clauses and imperative
structures. Complex constructions are also included in this chapter.
Chapter 5 concentrates on the typological features of the language. An attempt is
made to classify and categorize the language typologically.
Chapter 6 presents the conclusion of the thesis.","[52, 53]"
"1871884.9.1Grammatical relationsDifferent grammatical roles and the relations between them can be expressed by
various means at the syntactic level. Some languages employ case marking to
differentiate the different roles of the core arguments; some languages resort the
fixed word order for the same purpose. In the case of Jarawa, grammatical
relations between arguments are expressed through referential marking.
Jarawa does not demonstrate any kind of case marking on its core arguments S,
A and O. It does, however, use a referential marker, usually with S or O, rarely
with A. This rareness of its use with the A of a transitive verb suggests that this
referential marker ɖi is employed to indicate grammatical relations. These
grammatical relations entail that this language follows ergativity-absolutive
patterns; however, the context for the use of ergativity-absolutive is
referentiality/definiteness. The other strategy to differentiate S/O from A is
specific to pronominal arguments and deals with prefixation of S/O to the verb
which is not possible with A.
Let us look first at pronominals. Pronominals never take ɖi, but can be prefixed
to verbs if a verb begins with a vowel. It has been observed in section 3.3.1.1 that
prefixation of pronominals to verbs is possible only for S or O pronominals, and
not A pronominals. For example, in (4.133) we have prefixation of the S
argument to the verb aʈiba ‘say’. Similarly in (4.133) the O argument of the verb
əjojəba ‘see’ is prefixed.","[205, 206]"
"202203This type of adjectives also includes physical attributes. Possession is expressed
by the use of pronominals.
5.3.5 Verbal morphology
Like nouns, verbs are also classified into two categories: bound roots and free
roots. Only forms which are exclusively used for humans are bound roots. For
instance, ənətəhə ‘sit [HUMAN]’ has two morphemes, ən and ətəhə, because this
form has other forms like mətəhə ‘I sit’, əhitəhə ‘s/he/they sit’, and ənətəhə ‘you sit’.
For other animals oho ‘sit [NON-HUMAN] is used.
Jarawa does not show tense or aspect marking on the verbs, nor does it have
agreement marked on the verbs. However, a verb takes suffixes and prefixes
with the proviso that only one prefix and one suffix can attach to the verb at a
time. The principle function of suffixes in this language is to convey mood,
modality, and evidentiality; the prefix indicates the presence of the direct object.
This prefix is always the 3rd person pronoun and referred to as co-referencing
element in the present work. Further, personal pronouns, used as S and O
arguments of a verb, also get prefixed if there is no intervening element between
pronoun and verb. A verb that starts with a vowel may also take the
definiteness/referential marker as a prefix, provided there is no intervening
element between the definiteness/referential marker and the verb.
5.4 Word order typology of Jarawa
Though the term “word order typology” was in use for a long time, it was
Greenberg who brought the discipline to the forefront. Greenberg (1963) refers to
linguistic typology as a field which discusses the linguistic patterns of language
vis-à-vis some attributes. For instance, if a language is VSO, it will have
203204prepositions. These kinds of attributes are discussed in length in Greenberg
(1963). Basically, linguistic patterns were discussed with features like the
canonical pattern of subject, verb and object with reference to adpositions, nounadjective relations, noun-genitive relations, and noun-numeral relations. This
section focuses on word order in clauses, the position of the adposition, order of
noun-adjective, noun-genitive, noun-numeral, adjective-intensifier, verb-adverb,
and so on. This section will also investigate syntactic and morphological features
correlating with the word order as proposed by Greenberg (1963).
5.4.1 Word order in clauses
Typologically, word order in clauses means the order of subject, object and verb.
The order of these three elements determines the ordering of other pairs of
elements in the language. For example, if a language is SOV, there is a greater
chance that the language will have postpositions. Thus the order of subject,
object, and verb may determine the order of noun and adposition.
Jarawa is an SOV language: the subject precedes the object and the object
precedes the verb. This occurs in simple sentences which have a subject, a sigle
object, and a verb. But when a simple sentence has two objects, the pattern may
be subject, direct object, indirect object, and verb. Or it may be subject, indirect
object, direct object, and verb. The difference between the two is that when the
direct object is moved to the position immediately after the subject, the verb
contains the information that there is a direct object inside the clause (for the
difference in representation of direct and indirect object, see § 4.3.4). Let us
consider the following examples.","[220, 221, 222]"

6.fishing netpatʰo7.net basketpotʰo8.basket made out of caneta:ɽka9.cooking vesselbu:čʰu3.3.2.1 Gender
Jarawa lacks grammatical gender; thus there is no inflection for gender, nor is
there any gender agreement within the Noun Phrase. However, the language has
different lexical items to indicate the (natural) sex of an object. The examples in
(3.24) demonstrate the occurrence of nouns in different genders. In (3.24), the
words əŋka:w ‘old man’ and əŋka:ja:b ‘old woman’ as well as ta:hwə ‘bachelor’ and
ta:hwəja:b ‘spinster’ indicate that the form {-ja:b} represents feminine gender.
9495However, the use of ja:b was found in only these two pairs of words, preventing
any definitive statements on the matter of gender in Jarawa.

Countable nouns in Jarawa are classified as singular and plural where singular
denotes a single entity and plural indicates more than two entities. To express
singular number, Jarawa makes use of zero marking while to denote plural, the
language employs the suffix {-le}. The examples in (3.25) and (3.26) illustrate
number marking in Jarawa.","[111, 112, 113]"
"3233The structured method was adopted only in restricted cases. There are two
things to be noted in this regard: the structured method was adopted while
pictorial method was employed, i.e. collecting data with the help of pictures; and
there was an attempt to verify the data.
1.7.2.3.2. Systematic observation
Participant observation
In order to collect linguistic data in a monolingual community, participant
observation is one of the significant methods. This method not only allowed me
to observe the way they speak, but also provided me an opportunity to know
how they perform other activities. It also helped me note down the conversation,
and its context. Moreover, it helped consultants get rid of their hesitation in the
presence of an outsider, since Ibecame a part of their daily lives. This provided
me the opportunities to learn many things about their social and cultural norms
without disturbing them. Throughout my fieldwork in the Andamans, I adopted
participant observation method along with other methods which are described in
§ 1.7.4.
1.7.2.4 Field Procedures
I followed different techniques to collect data in the field. These techniques
included pictorial method, showing objects to them to know the name of those
objects; listening to their conversations, and recording those conversations. In the
initial phase, carefully listening to their conversations, recording pieces of
conversations, and listening to those conversations back home where I used to
stay were the major steps I took. This helped me accustom my ear to the sound
system of the language. Meanwhile, I started collecting data with help of pictures
3334related to body-parts, birds, animals, fish etc. It was followed by noting words by
pointing to objects that were lying around. I also attempted to list words related
to daily activities such as run, walk, sleep, eat, drink etc. by pointing to these
activities if somebody was enacting them. Moreover, I kept noting down simple
sentences which I could understand (after collecting some data). I also noted the
contexts of sentences/conversations. As time passed I picked up the language
and tried to speak small phrases. This gave me an opportunity to learn, converse,
and collect further data on the language.
1.7.3 Limitations of the study
Despite all the efforts made by me to elicit maximum amount of, there were
limitations to this study. Firstly, there was a very limited amount of time
available to be in contact with the community. As mentioned earlier, the
condition that AAJVS staff must be present at all times caused a severe
restriction of contact between the researcher and the consultants. Secondly,
whenever the group of Jarawas stayed far away from the road side along the sea
shore, contact with Jarawas depended on the short visits made available with
AAJVS staff. It is true that I was totally dependent on the mercy of the AAJVS
staff. Thirdly, it had, always, been a problem and challenge to obtain data from a
monolingual community to write a descriptive grammar. I am aware that there is
a lot of grammatical information which may have escaped my attention. Readers
will also agree with me that it is not possible to unearth each and every
grammatical information of the language in a limited time period. Hence, this
work is a modest attempt to present a descriptive grammar of the Jarawa
language from a typological point of view based on the data I could elicit from
my consultants during the period of my stay at Great Andaman.","[50, 51, 52]"

There are some cases where the interrogative marker ka is employed in this type
of wh-question, as shown in (4.100). It was not ascertained why ka appears in
such cases. The ordering of the interrogative marker and other constituents of the
clause is as we have in other interrogative constructions, where we have
interrogative marker in the beginning of the clause followed by other
constituents.

Some constructions involve the structure SUB + INTM + question word. These
constructions mostly contain the subject NP and the question word for ‘where’.
For example, in the sentence (4.102) there is a subject NP čajwaj and question
word ʈʰučəʈəgə, consequently we have ‘cajwaj ka ʈʰučəʈəgə’175176(4.102) čajwaj
CaywaykaʈʰučəʈəgəINTMwhereWhere is Cayway?
This sentence can also be formed without ka:
ʈʰučəʈəgə(4.103) čajwajCayway where
Where is Cayway?
Putting the interrogative marker ka at the beginning of the sentence causes
ungrammaticality. For example:
(4.104) * ka
INTMčajwajʈʰučəʈəgəPNwhereWhere is Cayway?
4.8 Complex sentences
The present corpus shows evidence of coordination, and of direct and indirect
speech. There is no substantial evidence for complex sentences involving
subordination. Distinguishing between direct and indirect speech is difficult
since no complementiser or any particle is used in such constructions.","[192, 193, 194]"
"219220Chapter 6: ConclusionThe Jarawas are a monolingual community living along the western coast of
Andaman Islands. The Jarawa people are primarily hunter-gatherers of Negrito
stock, with short stature, black skin, and frizzy hair. There is no evidence of
where they migrated from. Geneticists claim that these people were part of early
migrations of Palaeolithic colonisers of Southeast Asia (Thangaraj et al. 2003: 8693). Kasyap et al. (2004) commented that it appeared that the aboriginal
populations of Andaman Islands remained in isolation for a longer period than
any known ancient population of the world. The Jarawas came in contact with
the outside world at the end of 1998. After full contact was established at the end
of 1998, this is the first attempt to write a descriptive grammar of the language of
the Jarawas. For data elicitation, the method of participant observation was
adopted. During the initial phase, the pictorial method was also followed. In the
pictorial method, pictures of body parts, fish, animals, insects, etc. were shown to
the consultants to collect the data related to these pictures. Natural conversations
among participants were noted down. Since the community is monolingual,
learning the language of the participants was inevitable. The data collected in the
span of four years has been the only source for writing the present thesis.
Based on the initial description, the data was further investigated in order to
place Jarawa in the typological framework provided by Greenberg (1963) and
later supplemented by Hawkins (1984) and Dryer (2007).
In segmental phonology, the sound inventory, syllabic structure, and
phonological phenomena of the language were described. The discussion also
220221included problems associated with the identification and establishment of
sounds as phonemes. In order to establish the phonemic status of a particular
sound, four methodological principles were adopted. These principles were
phonological contrast, variability among sounds, distribution of sounds and
statistical criterion.
The sound inventory contains 41 sounds, out of which 28 are consonants and 13
are vowels. The vowel system was classified into two groups based on
qualitative contrasts and quantitative difference. In qualitative difference, threeway distinction in height, three-way distinction in tongue position, and two-way
distinction in the position of lips were found. One high-mid central unrounded
vowel /ᵼ/ was also attested. Length was found to be phonemic except for the
high-mid central unrounded vowel. In the consonant category, voiceless and
voiced plosives and voiced nasals were attested. These plosives and nasals were
classified based on five places of articulation, namely bilabial, dental, retroflex,
palatal, and velar. The aspirated counterparts of these plosives were also found
(except bilabial). In the consonantal group, trill, flap, lateral sounds were also
found. Two approximants, bilabial and palatal, were also attested. Bilabial
fricative and pharyngeal fricative were also found, though this study could not
establish bilabial fricative as a phoneme. Two labialised sounds, namely voiceless
aspirated velar plosive and voiceless pharyngeal fricative, were also found.
The thesis also investigates the distribution of sounds at syllable level and word
level. Most of the consonants are found both syllable-initially and -finally, but
the sounds /ʈʰ, č, čʰ, ǰ, ɲ, r, hʷ/ are not found syllable finally. Vowels were not
taken into consideration at syllable level because vowels form the nucleus of a
syllable whether it is initially or finally. At the word level short vowels were
221222found to occur at initial, medial and final position while long vowels were found
to occur only initially and medially.
Syllable structure was also investigated, and it was found that the syllable in
Jarawa has a nucleus with optional onset and optional coda; the language attests
all four variants of minimal possible syllable structures: V, CV, VC and CVC. It
was also found that the language allows only one consonant in onset position
and one consonant in coda position. Words in Jarawa were found to be
monosyllabic, disyllabic or polysyllabic.
In phonological processes, the use of mi forms and ma forms was discussed.
Jarawa demonstrates the use of reduced forms in possessive constructions which
are compound words consisting of a possessive prefix and an independent root.
The first syllable of the independent root gets truncated and the reduced form is
attached to the possessive prefix.
In the morphology it was found that this language is agglutinating in nature, and
employs simple morphology in terms of affixation. There were a few prefixes
and suffixes. In the prefix category, there were pronominals and the
referential/definiteness marker whereas in the suffix category, were mood,
modality or evidential marking with verbs, plural marking with nouns, and
state/evidential marking with adjectives. Six word classes were found: noun,
pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, and postposition.
Two kinds of roots were attested: free root and bound root. Three kinds of
prefixes were confirmed, which were possessive prefixes, pronominals, and the
referential/definiteness marker. In the suffix category negative suffix, evidential222223marker, mood/modality marking, state/evidential marking, plural marking,
denominalisation suffix were attested.
Two kinds of Noun Phrases (NPs) were found: nominal headed NPs and
pronominal headed NPs.
Pronominals are divided into three persons: first person, second person and third
person. Plural counterparts of these were not found. Morphologically,
pronominals were found to behave differently from nouns. Pronominals attach
to nouns as possessive prefixes, adjectives as subjects of complement clauses, and
to verbs as subjects of intransitive verbs or objects of transitive verbs. Two forms
of pronominals are also attested. These two forms were the “mi” form and the
“ma” form. Phonologically these forms demonstrated vowel harmony in the case
of the possessive prefix. When the possessive prefixes are used as independent
words, “mi” form is used. In syntax the “mi” form was found to be used as
subject whereas the “ma” form was used as object. Though the morphological
behaviour of pronominals indicated that they could possibly be considered as a
clitic, in this study this phenomenon is left for further research.
Two kinds of demonstrative pronouns, proximate li and distant luwə, are
attested. onne ‘who’, onəhə ‘what’, kahaje ‘where’, ʈʰučəgə ‘where’, nojčʰe ‘how
many/much’ were observed as interrogative pronouns.
Nouns were classified into Class I (bound roots) and Class II (free roots). Class II
were further classified semantically into celestial bodies, cultural artifacts, and
flora and fauna.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"142143CHAPTER 4: SYNTAX4.0 Introduction
The preceding chapter was a detailed study of Jarawa morphology. The present
chapter attempts to describe the syntactic structure of Jarawa: syntactic strategies
(how the language conveys commands, requests; the formation of questions, the
use of Reported Speech, and so on) and clause structure. The chapter will
elaborate these structures and their variances.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 4.1, I present a brief
introduction to Jarawa clause structure. Section 4.2 discusses the verbless clause
in which a nominal or an adjective may play the role of a predicate. In section 4.3
is a detailed discussion of the verbal clause with core argument. Section 4.4
discusses verbal clauses with peripheral arguments. Section 4.5 focuses on the
negative construction, and section 4.6 describes imperative structures (includes
commands, requests, and prohibition). Section 4.7 concentrates on how
interrogative constructions are formed: it further focuses on yes/no and whquestion types. In section 4.8, complex sentences are discussed, and a close
examination of direct speech is presented. Section 4.9 attempts to depict the
function of definiteness/referential morpheme {ɖi} which seems to be used in the
ergative-absolutive system. Section 4.10 presents the conclusion of the chapter.
4.1 Clause Structure
Jarawa employs two types of clausal structures: verbless clauses where nominals
or adjectives function as head of the predicate; and verbal clauses where verbs
143144are the head of the predicate, with core arguments and/or peripheral arguments.
Both types of clauses have different morphological and syntactic structures.
Verbless clauses generally lack modality categories which are part of verbal
clauses.
Verbless clauses (nominal predicates and adjectival predicates) contain nouns or
adjectives as the head. Morphologically, adjectival predicates differ from
nominal predicates at least in terms of affixation, but cannot be classified as
verbal predicates for they combine with a marker {–g} which differentiates
adjectival predicates from nominal predicates. I have made an attempt to
investigate whether the morpheme {–g} is equivalent to the suffix {–g} which is
attached to verbal predicate. It has been observed that no other suffixes, which
can be attached to verbal predicates, can be attached to adjectival predicates. In
the case of nominal predicates there is no prefixation of S argument pronominals,
but in adjectival predicates such prefixation is possible in cases where adjectival
predicates begin with a vowel. Otherwise, adjectival predicates follow the
syntactic structure of nominal predicates.
The copula can be the head of a predicate; it takes modality suffix. Data in the
corpus, at this point, is limited to only one sentence. Thus it is difficult to
ascertain whether the copula should be considered as a predicate. Moreover, it
has another function in the syntactic structure of the language: it is sometimes
used with verbs used to indicate adverbial function (detailed discussion in § 3.8).
In this dissertation copula constructions are described under verbless clauses.
Clause structures are also defined in terms of the arguments. In verbal clauses,
the core arguments S (subject), A (agent), O (object) are defined in terms of the144145Subject of intransitive verb, Agent of transitive verb and Object of transitive verb
respectively.
4.2 Verbless clauses
The two types of verbless clauses — nominal predicates and adjectival predicates
— differ morphologically and syntactically. Nominal predicates do not bear any
morphological marking, whereas adjectival predicates can have morphological
marking.
4.2.1Nouns as head of verbless clauseWhile verbal predicates take modality and evidential categories as suffixes, and
adjectival predicates may also take a suffix (for detailed discussion see § 3.5 and
§ 4.2.2.3), nominal predicates never take such suffixes. Also, unlike verbal and
adjectival predicates, pronominals are not prefixed to S argument of nominal
predicates.
Nominal predicates have two different kinds of structures depending on whether
the S argument is a noun or a pronominal. If a pronominal is the S argument of
the nominal predicates, the clause is formed by juxtaposition, i.e. the pronominal
followed by the nominal predicate. If a noun is the S argument, the copula ʈʰi is
employed in the clause.
4.2.1.1 Pronominal as S argument of nominal predicate
Nominal predicates can have a pronominal as the S argument of the clause.
When a pronominal is the S argument of the clause, the pronominals preceding
the nominal predicates are juxtaposed. The structure of a verbless clause in the145146case of a pronominal being the S argument of a nominal predicate is given in
(4.1).
(4.1) [S]PRO[VL P]NPIt must be noted that the copula ʈʰi can never be used in such clauses.
Furthermore, the pronominal is never prefixed to the nominal predicate in such
constructions. For instance, in example (4.2), mi is the first person pronoun which
is the S argument of the nominal predicate əŋ, thus we have “mi əŋ” without
prefixing the pronoun to the predicate nominal. It seems that such distinction is
necessary to maintain since there is prefixation of the pronoun to the nouns in
possessive constructions (for detailed discussion see § 3.3.2.4).

"But the use of ɖi in sentence (4.148) raises a question about the criteria employed
to consider an NP to be definite. In this sentence, ɖəwaɖəwa ‘biscuits’ is neither
seen nor not does it refer to a definite packet of biscuits. It may be the case that
the reference here is to a specific kind of packets of biscuits which the researcher
(myself) generally used to bring during fieldwork.

REF-bring-VEVDBring a packet of biscuits. (lit. Must bring a packet of biscuits).
4.10 Cleft sentences/relativisation
In this language, there is at present no clear cut evidence for relativisation. There
are, however, some constructions which suggest that relativisation may be192193employed in this language. These constructions are reminiscent of English cleft
constructions. The example (4.149) appears to be a simple interrogative clause
where there is an interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’ and a noun phrase əŋ
‘Jarawa’, connected with a copula ʈʰi. Literally it means ‘it is which Jarawa?’
(4.149)onneʈʰiəŋ?whoCOPJarawaWhich Jarawa is there? (Who is there?)
In (4.149) above, the interpretation of the clause is ’one of the Jarawas, but not
certain which’. This interpretation suggests two things: (1) this clause denotes
some indefinite entity, and (2) it seems that it may be similar to ‘it is which
Jarawa who is there?’ Moreover, this entire clause could be the S or A argument
of a clause. For instance, in (4.150) onne ʈʰi əŋ functions as the A argument of the
verb odehe ‘cut’. The structure of (4.150) can be represented as (4.151).
(4.150)onneʈʰiəŋtaŋodehewhoCOPJarawatreecutIt is which Jarawa who cut the tree?","[210, 211]"
"3.4.5Function of suffixes: evidentiality and modalityModality in Jarawa is marked as a verbal inflection. The morphemes indicating
mood are verb-sensitive: a morpheme can attach to a specific verb or group of
verbs. The kinds of modality marked in Jarawa are assertive and hypothetical.
Jarawa expresses evidentiality morphologically. Evidentiality in Jarawa falls into
two types: verifiable and non-verifiable. In verifiable cases, the speaker presents
the event as truth, and the hearer can verify the truth of the statement by
examining. In non-verifiable cases, the hearer does not have this facility. The
Jarawas distinguish two types of evidentials in the non-verifiable category: one
where the event is recent, so its effect of the event is still present; and the other
where the event is not in the recent past, so its effect may have been lost.
3.4.5.1 Evidential Marker
Jarawa employs evidential markers. This language distinguishes verifiable
evidential marker and non-verifiable evidential marker. Verifiable evidential
markers imply that the event can be verified by hearers and non-verifiable
evidential markers signify that event cannot be verified. The suffix {-jə} ~ {-wa} is
the verifiable evidentiality marker. The suffixes {-ʈʰe} and {-b} are non-verifiable
evidentiality marker.",[126]
"4.7 Interrogative clauses
Interrogatives in Jarawa are of two types: ‘yes/no’ questions and wh-questions.
In first type, the interrogative marker ka is used at the beginning of the sentence,
while in the second type question words (interrogative pronouns) are used to
create the interrogative. However, there are some instances where the
interrogative marker is used even in wh-questions. All these structures are
described in the following sub-sections.
4.7.1Yes/no questionsThe schema of a yes/no question is presented in (4.81).
(4.81) ka + [subject]NP + {[object]NP} + Verb]]VP ?
In (4.81), object has been put within the curly bracket (to show optionality) since
intransitive verbs do not take an object. However, instead of an object some
peripheral arguments like a spatial NP may come between the subject NP and
the verb.",[188]
"4.3 Verbal Clauses – I: Core arguments
Apart from verbless clauses, Jarawa has verbal clauses. In a verbal clause, a verb
is the central part of predication. These verbal predicates generally contain core
arguments of the clause, essential express the activity/event, and peripheral
arguments which provide additional information about the activity/event.
As discussed in the section 4.1 as core arguments, a verbal clause can have
subjects (generally referred to S and A) and objects (referred to O). These S, A,
and O are defined as: S, the subject of intransitive verbs; A, the subject of
transitive verbs; and O, the object of transitive verbs. This distinction is very
significant, as these categories have different roles in the grammar of a language.
The category O can further be split into DO and IO. DO is the direct object of the
clause, also called the patient of the clause, which has the direct effect of the152153action. IO does not bear the direct effect of the action; it could be benefactor, goal
etc. The general schema of a clause in Jarawa is given below.
(4.24) [Subject9]NP {[IO]NP [DO]NP} Verb]]VP
Other than core arguments, there are peripheral arguments. These peripheral
arguments provide additional information. They are optional in the clause. These
include temporal and spatial adverbs and/or nouns. The schema given in (4.25)
represents the structure of a clause in Jarawa with peripheral arguments.
(4.25)[Temporaladverb/Nouns]ADVP[Subject]NP{[SpatialAdverbs/Noun]NP} {[Object]NP} Verb]]VP
In addition to these broad categories are smaller categories like referential
marker (see § 4.9), locational marker (see § 3.7), and others. These categories
emerge in certain specific contexts in a clause.
4.3.1Intransitive clausesIn intransitive clauses, Jarawa employs S arguments of intransitive verbs as core
arguments, and intransitive verbs as the head of predication. There are some
denominalised verbs which function as intransitive verbs. We may put these
denominalised verbs in two categories, one in which they form part of weathertype constructions, and another in which they form part of transitive verbs
(semantically); however, syntactically, they behave as intransitive verbs of the
clause (for detailed discussion, see § 4.3.2). Generally, intransitive clauses in
Jarawa can be formed as given in (4.26).","[170, 171]"
"(III)A complement clause will always describe a proposition; this can be a
fact, an activity, or a state (it may not be a place or a time).
(Dixon 2009:129)In Jarawa, clause internal clauses have the structure of a normal clause. They
denote a proposition. In the case of (4.107) it denotes an action. They also
demonstrate the syntactic properties of O (for detailed discussion see section 4.9),
it is, however, misleading to say that ujijə ɖ-ipale-jə functions as the O of bəᵼʈʰe,
since bəᵼʈʰe is an intransitive verb and it cannot take an O argument. I, still,
submit that such clauses are possibly made of two clauses: one is the main clause
and the other is the clause internal complement clause. This is based on the
180181assumption that these clause internal complement clauses are peripheral
arguments of the clause in case of (4.107). It is still an open question whether they
are complement clauses or not.
4.8.2.2 Complement external clauses
Another kind of complement clause is the clause external complement clause.
These types of clauses are not internal to the verb phrase of the main clause;
rather they exist as a different (dependent) clause. Direct and indirect speech is
considered as a clause external complement clause.
It is difficult to distinguish direct speech from indirect speech; for there is no
marking in both types. There are some instances where the difference between
direct and indirect speech seems to be employed, but the distinction between the
two could not be established. As the deictic center for pronouns in the utterances
indicates that such constructions are instances of direct speech, hence we
categorize these types of constructions as direct speech.
In such constructions, there are two clauses: one which is called reporting speech
consisting of reporting verb and another which is referred to reported speech. In
the present study reporting speech is referred to as main clause while reported
speech is referred to as dependent clause. In Jarawa the reported speech follows
the reporting verb but there is no particle or marker to distinguish the two
clauses: main clause and dependent clause. Thus, the direct speech in Jarawa has
the structure as given in (4.112).
(4.112) [Reporting Verb]MCL [Reported Speech]DCL181182The examples below illustrate the use of direct speech in declarative sentences,
interrogative sentences and imperative sentences.
a) Declarative sentences as reported speech
If the dependent clause is declarative, the syntactic structure remains the same.
The schema for this kind of construction is presented in (4.113) and illustrated in
(4.104-4.105).the examples that follow.

"5.4.12 Causative construction
SOV languages have a tendency to form morphological causatives by means of
suffixes. Contrary to this, Jarawa employs a prefix to form morphological
causative. In example (5.31) is an intransitive verb tʰulə ‘sleep’. The causative
form of the tʰulə is constructed by adding prefix {wa-}. The example in (5.34)
represents a declarative sentence while (5.31) is an imperative sentence.
(5.31)əččəlewa-tʰuləchildCAUS-sleepMake the child sleep.",[231]
"Based on the preceding discussion I conclude that Jarawa marks grammatical
relations through the use of the definiteness/referential marker ɖi. This language
employs a split system of ergative-absolutive to denote grammatical relations
and the context of the use of this ergative-absolutive is referentiality/definiteness.
4.9.2DefinitenessThe morpheme ɖi is also used to indicate definiteness. The sentence (4.145)
demonstrates that ɖi is employed with the noun iŋ ‘water’ when the water is
within sight of the speaker-hearer. Hence, iŋ ‘water’ in (4.145) refers to some
particular water or a specific container which has water. If the water is not seen,
the co-referencing prefix h- is used instead of ɖi as given in (4.146).(4.145) ma
1ACCiŋɖ-ijawaterREF-giveGive me that water (water is seen).",[209]
"7273Chapter 3: Morphology3.0 Introduction
The preceding chapter was a detailed examination of phonetics and phonology
of Jarawa. This chapter focuses on Jarawa morphology with specific emphasis on
different word classes. Jarawa is an agglutinating language and has simple
morphology in terms of affixation, i.e. it takes prefixes and suffixes. There are
two kinds of prefixes: one is pronominal which attaches to verbs, adjectives, and
nouns; the other indicates definiteness or referentiality, and attaches only to
verbs. The principal functions of suffixes are (1) to convey plurality when
attached to nouns, and (2) to express mood, modality, and evidentiality when
attached to verbs. They can also, however, attach to adjectives, where they may
denote either state or evidentiality.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 3.1, a brief
introduction to the concepts of morpheme and word in Jarawa is presented.
Section 3.2 focuses on word classes in Jarawa, and section 3.3 discusses noun
morphology. A detailed examination of Jarawa verb morphology is presented in
section 3.4 and of Jarawa adjectives in 3.5. Section, 3.6 presents adverbs, and
section 3.7 postpositions. Section 3.8 is a discussion of copula, and section 3.9
focuses on word formation. A brief conclusion is presented in 3.10.
3.1 Morpheme/word
The criterion that has been followed throughout the dissertation to identify a
morpheme is: a phonologically defined set of segments having a constant range
7374of meaning in the overall structure of the language is a morpheme. Phonetic
criteria of the production of a defined set of segments in one breath, or with a
pause, have also been taken into consideration, particularly to decide whether
two morphemes are articulated as a word or two different words.
In Jarawa, a morpheme may be a free root which exists independently, as in the
case of /napo/ ‘fish’. It may be a bound root which occurs with obligatory
prefixes (possessive prefixes in the case of a noun) as in ən-oɖə ‘hair’ (where {ən-}
is used as generic possessive marker for humans). Sometimes, a verb may be a
bound root such as ən-ətəhə ‘sit’ (imperative) for humans. In both cases whether
it is the nominal root oɖə ‘hair’ or verbal root ətəhə ‘sit’, they cannot occur
independently if they refer to human beings. The nominal root oɖə ‘hair’ can be
used for the hair of humans as well as non-human animals while verbal root
ətəhə ‘sit’ is only used for human beings. In the case of non-humans, the third
person genitive marker would be used with such a root. For example, if the hair
of a dog is to be referred to, wᵼmə wa-oɖə ‘dog 3POSS-hair’.
Thus, a bound root has to be prefixed with some morpheme(s). There are two
kinds of prefixes which co-occur with nominals: one is the definite genitive
marker (personal possessive pronoun), and the other the generic human
possessive pronoun {ən-}. The morpheme {ən-} is a more obvious choice for
prefixation in case of humans. It has two interpretations in this language; one is a
generic interpretation for humans, and the other, a second person pronominal.
There are other kinds of morphemes which can attach to roots/stems — whether
free or bound — as prefixes or suffixes; these can be classified as bound
morphemes. For instance, the word bəᵼʈʰe-jə ‘go-VEVD’ contains two morphemes;
7475one is bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’ and the other is {-jə} ‘VEVD’. Here bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’ is a free morpheme
and {-jə} ‘VEVD’ is a bound morpheme. A morpheme which occurs as a free root
or bound root, will, in the present study, be referred to as a lexical word, and a
morpheme which has to be attached to a root/stem as an affix, as a bound
morpheme.
3.2 Word classes
In order to identify word classes in Jarawa, it is necessary to go beyond notional
definitions that entail much overlapping. Therefore, a scrutiny of different words
is attempted through different diagnostic tests. Consequently, two more criteria,
morphological diagnosis, and syntactic distribution, have been employed to
identify different word classes in Jarawa. The morphological test is based on the
choice of the occurrences of prefixes and suffixes with the root form. Specifically,
the choice of a prefix or a suffix depends upon the lexical category of the root.
For instance, Tense Aspect and Mood (TAM) category only comes with a verbal
roots or a root used as the verbal predicate of a clause. In the syntactic
distribution test, the occurrences of lexical roots in certain syntactic
configurations have been evaluated. The distribution of lexical roots in a
clause/sentence depends upon the lexical category they belong to. For instance, a
lexical root may occur either as a subject, object, adjunct, or predicate, in a clause.
After scrutiny it was found that Jarawa has six kinds of word classes: noun, verb,
pronoun, adjective, adverb, and postposition. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs are open classes, where nouns and verbs are abundant while adjectives
and adverbs are fewer in number; postpositions and pronouns are closed classes
with a small number of lexemes. In (3.1) these classes are arranged in decreasing
order of the number of words in each class.
7576(3.1) noun > verb > adjective > adverb > pronoun > postposition
3.3 Noun Morphology: Nouns and Noun Phrases
This section focuses on nouns and pronouns, and their morphological behaviour
in the language. The section also discusses other categories that could be part of a
Noun Phrase (NP), and their behaviour within the phrases. An NP can have
noun or pronoun as head. Section 3.3.1 discusses pronouns and their different
forms, section 3.3.2 focuses on nouns and their forms, and section 3.3.3 deals
with the noun phrase and elements which could be part of the noun phrase.
3.3.1PronounsPronouns are heads of NPs. They have no lexical content, and either refers to
some nouns which may have occurred within the sentence, or draw reference
from context. These types of NPs occur at the place of noun-headed NPs to avoid
repetition. There are three kinds of pronouns: personal pronouns (pronominals),
demonstrative pronouns, and interrogative pronouns.
3.3.1.1 Personal pronouns
Jarawa uses personal pronouns to refer to humans and non-humans. It employs
mi as first person, ŋi as second person, and hi as third person pronoun. Second
person has, however, three variants {ŋi, ni, and ən} and third person has two
variants {hi and əhi}. {ən} has two functions in this language. First, it is used as
second person pronominal (generally as subject and possessive forms). Second, it
is used as a pronominal that has generic interpretation for humans. Jarawa
personal pronouns are summed up in table 3.1 below.","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"
"(3.101)tenmejʈʰičewPNCOPgoodTenmey is good.
In the comparative degree involving comparison of two nouns, the noun being
compared precedes, without any additional morpheme (it has zero case
marking). The standard of comparison follows, and appears with a morpheme
{wɛ} which is, in the present study, referred to as the comparative morpheme
(COMPM). This morpheme may also be referred to as a postposition, as it is used
after the standard of comparison, not with the adjective. In this work {wɛ} is
taken as a comparative morpheme because its use is limited to comparison in the126127present corpus, and there is no other comparison-denoting element in such
constructions.(3.102) ugəmomowɛʈʰiučəhəUgəMomoCOMPMCOPshortUgə is shorter than Momo.
The superlative degree is formed by combining the adjective with an adverb, or
by using a new word which is not morphologically similar to the positive form of
a descriptive adjective. In (3.103), there is an adverb ʈʰuhumə ‘very’ which is used
to indicate superlative degree.

There is no overt syntactic case marking in Jarawa to differentiate between nouns
in their different grammatical roles. Generally word order serves this purpose.
Nonetheless Jarawa expresses the semantic case of the noun by means of
postpositions, as shown in example (3.29). A detailed discussion of case marking
is presented in section 3.7.

"4.9 Function of {ɖi}
The uses of morpheme ɖi seem to be various. Generally, this morpheme appears
after a noun phrase to indicate definiteness. It can occur with a S(ubject) NP or
O(bject) NP but rarely occurs with A(gent) NP of a clause. This usage of ɖi
suggests that it is also employed to express grammatical relations in a clause.
This morpheme is also used with VPs which appear to be clause internal
complement clauses. It occurs after the constituents, it is refers to; hence, it
moves with the constituents in a clause if they move to other places in a clause.
However, there are certain conditions on the use of the morpheme ɖi. The
conditions to employ ɖi in a clause are as follows:
i)This morpheme never occurs with pronominals.",[202]
"Jarawa is a non-tonal language. It employs a seven-vowel system with a threeway distinction in height and a two-way distinction in the horizontal position of
the raised part of the tongue. Thus, this language has /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, /u/, /ə/ and
/ᵼ/. This seven-vowel system also has contrast in length.
The consonant system in this language contains plosives in abundance, followed
by nasals. Plosives demonstrate a five-way distinction in place {bilabial, dental,
retroflex, palatal and velar} and two-way distinction of voicing. Thus, the
language has /p, b/, /t, d/, /ʈ, ɖ /č, ǰ/ and /k, g/. Aspiration is also distinctive in
voiceless plosives except /p/. Two fricatives {voiceless bilabial and pharyngeal}199200are also attested. Two approximants, bilabial and palatal, with a trill, a tap, and a
lateral are also present. No voiced consonant has aspiration at all. Labialisation is
not common in this language but one labialised pharyngeal fricative and one
labialised aspirated voiceless velar plosive are also found.
Jarawa has a (C)V(C) syllable structure with no consonant cluster either in initial
position or in final position. In this language the common phonological structure
of words is CV.CV. However, other kinds of phonological structures of words
like CVC.CV are also attested.
5.3 Morphological typology of Jarawa
5.3.1 Root and Affixes
This language exhibits a two-way classification of roots: free roots and bound
roots. Bound roots are human-specific, consisting of human body parts, kinship
terms and some verbs which are used only for humans; free roots are used for
other than non-humans.
Affixes fall into two categories, prefixes and suffixes. Possessive pronouns,
pronouns, definiteness/referential marker, and causative elements can occur as
prefixes. Plural marking, verbaliser, mood, modality and evidentiality marker
are used as suffixes. Sometimes the copula is also prefixed to adjectives. Among
the prefixes, only the causative prefix falls under affixes since other elements like
possessive prefix, definiteness/referentiality marker and pronouns can occur
independently in syntax. In the derivational category the causative element
occurs as a prefix whereas the verbaliser element (the affix which changes a noun
into a verb) is suffixed. Plural markings on nouns, and mood, modality and
evidentiality markers on verbs fall under inflection category.
2002015.3.2 Noun morphology
Jarawa employs a three-way classification of nouns: human body parts, kinship
terms, and other nouns. The human body parts and kinship terms are bound
roots whereas other nouns are free roots. Human body parts obligatorily take
definite possessive prefix or indefinite human generific possessive prefixes while
kinship terms carry only the definite possessive prefix obligatorily. In example
(5.1) oɖə ‘hair’ cannot occur as a free root if it refers to human hair; it must take a
possessive prefix which may be the indefinite human generic possessive prefix
ən- as in (5.1), or the definite possessive prefix like in (5.2). Similarly, awela
‘brother-in-law’ never occurs independently; it must occur with a definite
possessive prefix like in (5.3). Other nouns like napo ‘fish’, noha ‘bird’ čaɖɖa ‘hut’
occur as free roots. These nouns take a possessive prefix only when semantics
requires it.

1POSS-hair
my hair(5.3)m-awela
1POSS-brother-in-law
my brother-in-law (wife’s brother)201202Countable nouns are divided into two, singular and plural. Singular nouns bear
zero affixation while plural nouns take plural suffix /-le/, though plural marking
is not obligatory. Nouns do not bear grammatical gender markings. No syntactic
case marking is carried on nouns, i.e. subject, direct object and indirect object
have zero case marking. This language has definiteness/referential marking on
direct object and indirect object, which differentiates subject and object of a
clause. The language makes use of semantic case marking for location, temporal
and spatial nouns.
5.3.3 Pronominal system
Jarawa employs a three-way classification of personal pronouns based on person.
There are three persons: first person, second person, and third person. For third
person pronoun Jarawa also makes use of demonstrative pronouns. There is no
number and gender distinction in the pronominal system, neither in personal
pronouns, nor in demonstratives. Like nouns, pronouns also do not bear any
kind of case marking. One of the characteristic features of personal pronouns in
Jarawa is that they can be prefixed to nouns, adjectives, and verbs (in the case of
verbs, to only those beginning with a vowel, and with no other element
intervening between the verb and personal pronoun.
5.3.4 Adjective class
Adjectives can be divided into two broad categories: pure/descriptive adjectives
form one group and demonstratives and numerals constitute another group. The
division of adjectives is based on the use of adjectives in syntactic constructions.
Pure adjectives follow nouns while demonstratives and numerals precede nouns.
Pure adjectives consist of words related to dimension, age, colour, and value.","[217, 218, 219, 220]"

4.6 Imperative clauses
Jarawa does not use distinct expressions for requests and command, nor does the
language have any kind of morphological marking to show imperatives.
Syntactically, the predicate with its core argument expresses all types of
imperatives, whether request, command, advice, or order.
4.6.1Simple imperative clausesSimple imperative clauses in Jarawa use a verbal predicates with its core
argument; that is, (transitive) verb + object NP. Sometimes they make use of
vocative forms in such constructions, though there is no different morphological
form for vocatives; the name of the person referred to is used as it is. The schema
in (4.74) presents this structure, and is followed by examples.

"3.6.2Temporal adverbsTemporal adverbs are those adverbs which denote time, like today, tomorrow,
morning. Jarawa divides time as today, a day before today, a day after today. The
day is divided into morning before sunrise, morning after sunrise, noon,
evening, and night.
3.6.3Spatial adverbsJarawa divides immediate space into two different categories: proximate and
distant. Some examples of spatial adverbs include ikʰə ‘here (more proximate)’,
lijə ‘here’, luwə ‘there’, buʈʰə ‘near’, and no:ɖa ‘far away’. The usage of two other
words, lihəle and luwhəle is not clear. The adverbs lijə ‘here’ and luwə ‘there’ take
suffix {-kʰə} and ikʰə ‘here’ takes {-gə}. Though the meaning of these suffixes is not
clear, these are glossed as PL ‘place marker’ in the present study.
3.7 Postposition
In the present study it is difficult to ascertain whether Jarawa has postpositions.
Only two morphemes are attested which could be termed as postpositions. These
are {ɖə} and {ɲačʰe}. {ɖə} is glossed as locative (LOC) and {ɲačʰe} is glossed as
comitative (COM). {ɖə} is a multifunctional morpheme. It is employed to indicate
place of location, source of location, goal of location, and sometime it is also used129130with temporal and spatial adverbs. {ɲačʰe} marks the comitative. Note that use of
{ɖə} as a postposition appears to be vague. Sometimes this morpheme was found
as a separate word (particularly with longer words polysyllabic words) and
sometimes seemed to exist as a suffix (especially with monosyllabic and
disyllabic words). As for {ɲačʰe}, it is evident that this morpheme is used as a
postposition.
3.7.1Use of {ɖə}The morpheme {ɖə} has multiple functions in this language. It used with
nominals which indicate location of actions/events, and with temporal and
spatial adverbs. In location of actions/events it specifies place of location, source
of location and goal of location.
3.7.1.1 Place of location
The morpheme {ɖə} is used with nominals to express the place of location of the
action/event. In (3.107), {ɖə} has been employed with čaɖɖa ‘hut’. The
combination gives the place of location for the verb action čalahe ‘stay’.(3.107) mi

"223224Countable nouns were categorised as singular and plural. Singular nouns were
found to be zero marked while plural nouns had suffix {-le}. The use of plural
marking was found to be optional.
Possession is expressed by prefixation of pronominals. Inalienable nouns,
consisting of body parts and kinship terms, were found as bound roots. In
alienable possession both the nouns are free roots. In this kind of possession, the
possessive prefix (pronominal) is attached to the possessed noun.
The lexically headed noun phrase contains a noun as head, and optional
modifiers like possessive prefix, numerals, descriptive adjectives and adverbs.
The possessive prefix, demonstratives, and numerals precede the noun, while
descriptive adjectives and intensifier follow the noun.
Verbs in this language neither exhibit agreement nor carry tense and aspect
information morphologically. Time reference is expressed periphrastically by the
use of temporal adverbs. The Jarawas’ perception of time does not go beyond
three days. palahe ‘long before’ was found to be employed to express beyond
three days. Verbs were found to possess a few prefixes and suffixes.
Pronominals, referential/definiteness marking and co-referencing element were
seen to be used as prefixes, and mood, modality and evidentiality markers as
suffixes.
This language distinguishes between hypothetical and assertive moods, and
evidentiality. Evidential markers convey whether the action is verifiable or nonverifiable. Hypothetical mood indicates future actions/events which are either
doubtful or uncertain. Assertive mood expresses assertion or emphasis of the
action/events.","[241, 242]"
"1271283.5.4Adjective PhrasesUnlike numerals and the possessive prefix, the Adjective Phrase follows the
nouns. They may contain adverbs (intensifiers).
3.6 Adverbs
Jarawa has adverbs as a distinct word class. There is no derivational process to
convert adjectives into adverbs in this language. The adverbs which exist in this
language are purely lexical items. In this work adverbs will be classified as
intensifiers, temporal adverbs, and spatial adverbs.
3.6.1IntensifierThese are adverbs which modify adjectives or verbs. The number of adverbs in
this group is very small; only two or three such adverbs are attested. One of them
is ʈʰuhumə ‘very’. The adverb ʈʰuhumə is widely used to modify descriptive
adjectives and verbs. For instance, in example (3.105), ʈʰuhumə modifies an
adjective and in example (3.106) it modifies a verb. In both cases it follows the
element which it modifies.(3.105) paʈʰotaluʈʰuhuməarrowlongveryA very long arrow.","[145, 146]"
"Pronominals never take ɖi to express definiteness/referentiality or grammatical
relation in a clause. mi ‘I’ in example (4.124) is attached to the verb but it can
occur independently in such clauses. In example (4.125) there are two184185pronominals, one as A and another as O, but neither bear the morpheme ɖi.
These examples suggest that pronominals never take ɖi.
