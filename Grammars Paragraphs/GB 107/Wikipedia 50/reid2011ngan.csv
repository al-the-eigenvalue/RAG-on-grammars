In 6.2.6 I describe the use of -gumu as a semblative enclitic to
nominals. -Gumu additionally functions, in a completely unrelated sense,
as a marker of progressive/incompletive aspect. In this capacity -gumu
functions at clause level, i.e. having scope over the entire clause, not merely
the constituent that happens to host it. As noted for other clause level
enclitics, -gumu can either select the verb as its host, or may appear on
negatives, interrogatives, or verbal arguments that immediately precede the
verb.
As a marker of progressive/incompletive aspect -gumu interacts
differently with the modal categories realis and irrealis. In the two realisincompletive mood/aspect auxiliary inflectional categories, Present and Past
IMPerfective, -gumu denotes a subordinate clause as the temporal frame for
a main clause. To employ the terms used by Chung and Timberlake (1985),-gumu designates the clause over which it has scope, as the ‘event frame’

"SU PresHere the possessive pronoun modifying tyulut -'hook spear’, bears the

the spear, not as a piece of wood that is being used as a spear, but rather as a
piece of wood that is being mended in the way that other wooden objectsare.
Similarly, the statement that one ‘has no matches’, using the negative
particle minbe- suffixed with a generic, could be given as either 5-97 or 5-98.

wood, or as ‘fire’ by virtue of their function. Most of the examples of
crossclassing in Ngan'gityemerri are facilitated by the potential to variously
view certain objects with respect to their ‘inherent nature’ or 'function/use'
features. This suggests that the classes of wooden implements ‘bamboo
spears’, 'canegrass spears’, ‘hand held weapons’, 'woomeras', and ‘digging
sticks', could usefully be organised hierachically as sub-classes of yawurr
‘tree/things'. Higher level classification as yawurr is based on ‘inherent

tyiny or kini, is based on 'function/use' features.",[339]

Noun ClassificationNgan'gityemerri speakers employ a system of nominal classification
that divides the nominal world into fifteen categories.
Section 5.1
examines the manner in which membership within these categories is
signalled, and section 5.2 deals with the semantics of these categories. 5.3
looks at the types of modifying element that can be classmarked. 5.4 details
the suffixation of class generics to minbe ‘negative’ and tyen ‘what'. Finally
section 5.5 examines the phonological status of the set of bound class
generics, which varies between proclitics and prefixes.

Table 5-15.1
5.1.1Morphology of Nominal Classification
Descriptive Preliminaries
The classification of nouns in Ngan'gityemerri into fifteen separatecategories is signalled through the use of both freeform and bound generics.
While most nouns can be assigned to at least one class, there are some
nouns, mostly terms for natural objects such as sun, rocks, ground, stars,
tdclouds etc. that belong to no overtly marked class. I have chosen to analyse
these as belonging to no class rather than to a sixteenth O-marked class; a
decision that carries no significant consequences.
On the whole,
this system of noun classification is neither
homogenous nor internally consistent. Of the fifteen classes, six are denoted
by only freeform generics, five by only bound generics, and four employboth bound and freeform generics. Furthermore, among the class categories
having bound generics, there is considerable diversity regarding the
phonological status of those generics (see 5.5), and the types of modifiers to
which they may be attached (see 5.3).
Another important feature of the Ngan'gityemerri noun classificatory
system that will be treated here, concerns the grammatical status of the
mechanisms that signal class categories. As this has implications for the
terminology used in this section, I will begin with a review of Dixon's (1982)
comparison of the noun classification phenomena in Yidiny and Dyirbal.
Dixon (1982: chpt 5-8) compares the different systems in Yidiny and
Dyirbal that have the semantic function of classifying nouns, and contrasts
the grammatical status of these two systems. He provides criteria for
determining whether a language has a system of noun classes (like Dyirbal)on the one hand, or noun classifiers (like Yidiny) on the other.
""In summary, noun classes constitute a closed grammatical system, with a _
finite (usually fairly small) and determinable number of choices involved;each noun belongs to one class and few (or none) will correspond to more than
one class. Noun class is shown by morphological processes which can apply to
the noun itself and must apply to some other constituent; they sometimes
combine information about noun class and number, case or definiteness. The
morphological process most often involves adding an affix or clitic to
constituents of a number of specified grammatical types. Classifiers comprise a
largish (often semi-open) set, whose members may not be exhaustively
listable; each classifier is either a free form or else a root, to which a numeralaffix or clitic may be added. Not every noun may take a classifier; many nouns
may occur with one of a number of different classifiers, sometimes with a
be used in different ways in different speech styles within a language.""ayDixon goes on to speculate about the origins of these different
mechanisms in Yidiny and Dyirbal, suggesting both may have developedreBape(Dixon 1982:217-8)coatdifference in meaning and sometimes not. Classifiers, but not noun classes, mayfrom a small set of about half a dozen classifiers.","[312, 313, 314]"
"Consider 6-121 below, where the speaker isextending). a polite invitation to someone to feel free to contravene normal

The ‘unsatisfactory’ evaluation of a proposition (or, more especially,
an individual's role in a proposition), that is convey by -wurru, can interact
with the semantics of the verb and the general context of the discourse in a
way that leads to the interpretation of the speech act as an expression of
compassion or an expression of criticism. For instance, a -wurru marked NP
that is portrayed as the victim of some verb of adverse effect, as in 6-122, is
understood to be the object of the speaker's compassion. On the other hand,
a-wurru marked NP that is portrayed as the perpetrator of some adverse
proposition (or even potentially adverse proposition), is understood to be
the object of the speaker's criticism, as in 6-123.

ParticlesParticles differ from enclitics in being independent freeform
phonological words, and generally occurring clause-initially. Otherwise they
share broadly similar semantic functions to the enclitics discussed in the
preceding chapter. Wilkins (1989:347) has drawn attention to the ‘significant
degree of agreement between the stocks of meanings encoded through the
particle/clitic grouping’ in Australian languages generally. Most of the
particles discussed here have scope over an entire clausal proposition. The
three forms examined in 7.10 have the function of conjoining nouns and
clauses under certain, fairly limited, conditions. Particles cannot take any
form of inflection. 7.11 lists the class of interjections, which differ from
particles in constituting complete utterances on their own.

Noun class generics can be combined with tyen- ‘what’. The

degenerate bound generics of the ‘'plantfood', ‘animal’ and

Examples are structured as four lines. The first line is the
Ngan'gityemerri sentence/word in bold script. Loanwords are treated in
one of two ways. English loans which essentially retain their English
phonemicisation and meaning are given in the first line of examples in
plain rather than bold script, to denote their status as loan words (or in some
cases, code-switching). Loans from English which have been phonemicised
into Ngan'gityemerri, or have acquired new or extended meanings as
loanwords are given in bold script and provided with an interlinear gloss on
lines two and three (i.e. in accordance with Ngan'gityemerri speakers’
perception of such words, I have treated them as ‘proper NgK or NgW’).
The second and third lines of examples, in italic script, provide an
interlinear gloss. I've found the use of two lines necessary simply because of
the morphological density of the verb in particular. Lines 2 and 3 are meant
to be read jointly from left to right, rather than sequentially. For instance,
the gloss to the example given below should be read as;
wuddumbuny-ngerr -mi -wul
-nime-pagu
3pl Shove

Su/DO
su
They (three) brought me back here.
""third plural subject, ‘shove’ auxiliary in perfective inflection, portmanteau
dual subject and first singular direct object, valence increaser, return (verb
root), trial subject, hither directional”
As evident in the above example, I use a slash / between the glossed
elements of a portmanteau morpheme.
Another minor convention is the
inclusion, below the verb root, of the meaning of the verb. This is given
only in those verbs whose meaning is unpredictable from the combination
of the auxiliary and verb root semantics.
Auxiliary roots are glossed by name (e.g. 'Shove' in the example
above). The semantic nature of auxiliary verbs is discussed in detail in
chapter 5, and readers seeking explanation of auxiliary root glosses are
referred to this section. The 31 auxiliary names are listed below.

seeDtrThe fourth line of examples, in plain script, provides an English
translation. I've been fairly free with translations, attempting, in addition to
an accurate rendition, to convey something of the speech style. To this end,
in a few cases I have translated using expressions that are characteristic of
the English of Ngan'gityemerri speakers, but which may be less well known
in standard Australian English.
The use of brackets ( ) in the fourth line of examples either provides
contextual information which is missing from the given example, but
established within the wider discourse, or clarifies implications of the
example. e.g. I brought it for her (to give to her), (on her behalf), (at her
request) etc. A bracketed sentence below the line-4 translation is an
alternative translation.
Example numbers are of the form 3-56, where 3 denotes the chapter
number, and 56 denotes the example number within that chapter. Examples
in each chapter are renumbered from 1. Ngan'gikurunggurr examples are
marked by 'NgK’ below the example number. All examples not designated
as NgK should be understood to be Ngan'giwumirri, unless specified in the
text as some other language.","[22, 23, 24]"
"5.3.3Generics + Verbal Clause
Bound generics can also head a clause. The resultant nominalised
clause is fully finite, bearing all the pronominal crossreferencing and tense
marking morphology that it would as an independent clause.

the ones we'd used from their place.
The nominalisation of clauses by heading them with class generics in
this way, is the main strategy for deriving formal relative NPs in
Ngan'gityemerri. As noted above, nominalised clauses are fully finite,
having the form of independent clauses. It appears that in those Australian
languages having a general subordinate clause type, such clauses are
typically finite and have a fairly loose paratactic relation to the main clause
(see for instance Merlan (1983:135)). In Ngan'gityemerri however relative
clauses, though finite, are formally nominalised by the attachment of nounclass prefixes. I am unaware of any other Australian language for which this
use of nounclass markershas been reported.","[341, 342]"

-wurru is an enclitic that has the propositional function of indicating
that the speaker finds either the proposition as a whole, or a particular

evaluation of a proposition, or some entity's role in a proposition, because it
impacts on the speaker in some disadvantageous way.
Attached to adjectives and expressions of quantity -wurru apportions
the unsatisfactoriness of the proposition to the excess of that attribute or
quantity.

7.11Interjections
Interjections differ from particles in their capacity to constitute
utterances on their own. They typically express a reaction to an event, either
linguistic or extra-linguistic (cf. Laughren 1982:132). Several of the particles
discussed in 7.1 to 7.10 function also as interjections. These include ngunu
(cf. 7.2), wetimbi (cf. 7.3), and tyamennaza (cf. 7.7).yiyes

This thesis is a study of Ngan'gityemerri, a language spoken
primarily in and around the two communities of Nauiyu Nambiyu and
Peppimenarti in the Northern Territory.
Chapter One provides an introduction to the names by which
speakers of this language have been referred to, comments on the
relationship between the two dialects, and establishes my use of the term
Ngan'gityemerri as a language name. Also included in this chapter is a brief
account of the history of these people since European invasion of their
country began late last century, some comments on social organisation,
cultural affiliations, Wangga and Lirrga songstyles, and a description of their
country. The current status of the language is reviewed, and the language
variety presented in this work is clearly identified. A survey of previous
work on Ngan'gityemerri, and a description of my fieldwork methodology
are additionally included.
Chapter Two presents the segmental phonology, phonotactics, stress
patterns and morphophonological processes. Particular attention, in the
form of a detailed acoustic study, is given to the mechanism by which the
contrast between two series of stops is maintained.
Chapter Three presents an overview of ‘simple’ and 'complex' verb
structures, then identifies the morphological make-up of the verbal
_elements labelled ‘auxiliary’ and ‘complex verb stem’. The mechanisms
that interact to mark categories of tense, aspect and mood, namely auxiliary
root inflection, verbal enclitics, verb root reduplication and the serialisation
of posture/motion auxiliaries, are all addressed in this chapter. The
incorporation into the verb of bodypart noun roots is also investigated here.
A distinction between ‘lexical’ and ‘syntactic’ incorporation is invoked, and
the differences in the effect of both these types of incorporation is dealt with.
A list of incorporable terms is presented, and their literal and classificatory
semantics explored.
Chapter Four investigates the semantic contribution that the
auxiliary makes to the meaning of a full verb. The 31 auxiliaries are broken
down into six groups on the basis of their functional roles, which are
described in detail.
Chapter Five deals with the role played by both freeform and bound
generics in classifying the Ngan'gityemerri nominal world. The
morphology of these generics is surveyed with regard to the typological
distinction drawn between ‘noun class’ systems on the one hand, and‘classifier’ systems on the other. The semantics of noun class categories are
also examined here.
Chapter Six examines the set of enclitics, some of which have scope
over NPs and others over clausal propositions. The semantic functions of
this clitic set vary widely, some marking such case-like roles as 'agent' or
‘instrument’, others encoding the kinds of meanings, like speaker attitude,
that are commonly attributed to free particles. The class of free particles is
treated in Chapter Seven.
Chapter Eight provides a brief presentation of space, time and
number expression, and Chapter Nine deals with the freeform pronominal
system, demonstratives and interrogatives.
Appendices to this grammar include the full subject-auxiliary
sequence paradigms for both Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as
well as four texts. Cassette tapes of the textual material included in the
appendices have been submitted with this thesis, and copies of these will
gladly be made available by the author to any interested readers.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

"On the few occasions that I have heard these phrases used in this manner, their
utterance has been accompanied by hand-pointing in the appropriate direction. There are no
terms used for north or south, and the two terms for east and west are so under-exploited that
it seems to me that they exist above and beyond the traditional Ngan'gityemerri directional
system which is simply not of the compass directional type. Mirri menggetet and mirri
yenimdum may be traditionally employed terms, or they may be calques on either
neighbouring languages or indeed English. Either way, in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri
they appear to be disfavoured.",[397]
"The significance of the 1955 date is borne out in the marked difference in the
fluency in traditional Ngan'gityemerri that is evident between the ‘school
generation’ and those who never went to school.
Almost everyone
presently over the age of 40 years has full command of their first language,
usually in addition to some variety of Aboriginal English.
However
amongst those people now aged about 40 years (i.e. those who were
beginning school in 1956) and younger, there is a marked decrease in their
traditional language fluency. Although the degree of fluency amongst this
agegroup varies widely, very few have full command. Within this group
women tend to have a much higher degree of fluency than do men. As has
been noted elsewhere (e.g. for Kayardild in Evans (1985:28)), this is probably
in part a reflection of the patterns of social affiliation whereby young men
hang around in peer group gangs, while young women spend more time in
the company of older women, particularly within the confines of the single
women's camp.
This sub-40 generation has effectively lost both its traditional
language and the Aboriginal English of their parents. Most sub-40's retain a
good passive knowledge of standard Australian English (to which they have
quite heavy exposure through school and, especially, television and video).
However the commencement of English teaching in the mission school
seems to have coincided with (if not actually triggered) a shift away from
both traditional languages and Aboriginal/Standard English, towards the
Kriol that is now the first and active language of all children living at Daly
River Mission and Peppimenarti.
The status of Kriol within these
communities is recognised neither by the schools, which maintain an
English-as-first-language approach to their curriculum, nor by its speakers
who denigrate it as a ‘rubbish language’.
1.4.2DRM Communilect
Having noted the universal switch to Kriol as a first language in thesub-40 generation, let me add that there is a perceptible shift back to the re-acquisition of NgK that begins to show, mostly amongst young women in
their early twenties. The language variety acquired by these women is
referred to by them as 'Ngan'gikurunggurr'.
I call it 'New
Ngan'gikurunggurr' to reflect some minor differences that exist between it
and the traditional NgK of their parents' generation. It has near standard
NgK phonology, but both the apical (retroflex/ voiced) and laminal fricativeshave merged into an apico-alveolar[s], and the minor cluster /-rr + s-/ hasreduced to a voiceless alveolar stop [t] (e.g. ngirrsibem — ngitibem) The
lexicon of New Ngan'gikurunggurr is predominantly drawn fron NgK andNgW, but additionally includes a fair amount of Marrithiyel, e.g. makali
'MM! (cf. Ngan'gityemerri kawu),
One of the most characteristic features of this speech variety is the
widespread use of the Marrithiyel nominal semblative postposition gimin,
replacing the Ngan'gityemerri suffix -gumu/-gimi(K). Gimin is used as atemporal clause subordinator in New Ngan'gikurunggurr9, a function that
it shares with NgK -gimi, but not with Marrithiyel gimin (Green: pers.
comm.). In recent years I have begun to notice some of these features of
New Ngan'gikurunggur beginning to percolate upwards, creeping into the
speech of some older women.
1.4.3Language variety treated in this grammar
The language described in this grammar is the conservative
Ngan'gityemerri spoken by people over the age of forty (most informants’
names are listed in the acknowledgements). The language variety referred
to in 1.4.2 as New-Ngan'gikurunggurr, is not treated in any detail here.
Throughout this grammar I treat the two dialects, Ngan'giwumirri
and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as a single language. However rather than attempt
to treat them equally, I have chosen to focus on NgW and refer specifically
to NgK only where it differs from NgW in any significant way.

1.5.1Fieldwork Methodology and Grammar Writing
Getting started
In 1981 I had just completed a Batchelor degree in linguistics, and
found myself inspired by one of Bob Dixon's courses in Aboriginal
linguistics to do some real fieldwork of my own. Wary of committing
myself to a post-graduate course, I canvassed around the ANU linguistics
department to find someone who I could accompany on their fieldtrip. This
I felt would satisfy my curiosity, giving me a taste of fieldwork, and at the
same time leave me in a position that I could back out of, if need be. Ian
Green took me up on my enthusiastic but completely deceitful promises to
cook, do the washing, and write up his paradigms and verb cards etc, and
took me to the Daly on the first of his Ph.D fieldtrips. Ian was learning
Marrithiyel from Bill Parry, so we ended up in Bill's camp on the west side
of the Daly river. Three elderly women in Bill's camp (including his wife)20Several of the features of New Ngan‘gikurunguurr that are mentioned here, including this
function of -gimin (H&K 1988:219), can be found in Hoddinott and Kofod's grammar of
Ngankikurungkurr. Their main informant is a ‘school generation’ New Ngan’gikurunggurr
speaker.","[46, 47, 48]"

Naturally these particles can only occur with verbs expressing
activities/states that are amenable of extended-in-time interpretations. As
discussed in 4.4.2, such interpretations may be available through the
durative lexical: aspectual nature of the verb itself, as in 8-41 and 8-42. For an
aspectually neutral verb like ‘go’ in 8-43 iterative aspect, as aliowed for in the
habitual reading of the 'present' auxiliary inflection, allows for an extendedin-time interpretation. For an inherently punctual verb like ‘cough’, in 8-44
below, iterative aspect, as marked morphologically by reduplication of the
verb root, allows for an extended-in-time interpretation.

8.2.5Weeks and Months
The English weekday and month terms have all been borrowed into
Ngan'‘gityemerri, with the same reference except that syandi ‘Sunday’, in
addition to its particular weekday meaning, has taken on the sense of ‘aweek’. This use of syandi parallels the use of diwin
‘month’, as shown in 8-45 and 8-46.

spatial term ‘behind') and ambirri combine with syandi and diwin to
designate that unit-of-time either preceding or following the present. The
word yeyi ‘other’ can be added to these temporal expressions, and here it
implies the next consecutive such unit, rather than simply any other one.
_ Thus, syandi syirre yeyi 'the week after next’, diwin ambirri yeyi ‘a couple of
months ago’.
Reference to specific days of the previous or following week
can be made by denying the ‘this week' interpretation, and designating the
weekday as belonging to the preceding/following week. This is
demonstrated in 8-47 and 8-48. below.

Not the Monday (that was) yesterday, but (the Monday) of last

8.2.6Time of Year
Kidin ‘wet season' is also used to denote a full seasonal cycle between
wet seasons, thus ‘a year’. In this sense it behaves much like syandi and
diwin, see above. e.g. kidin syirre yeyi ‘the year after next’ etc.
Kudede is that time of year, usually around January or February,when there is monsoonal rain everyday.
Wangi and marrawuk/fuke (K) specifically denote the prevailing
winds that are associated with the two complete metereological systems thatdominate the local seasonal cycle, ie. the Wet and the Dry, respectively.
Wangi blows from the west, bringing mosquitos from the swamps,
marrawuk brings cool dry air from the east. Both these terms though, can
be used more generally in reference to the metereological sytem, rather than
just its prevailing wind.
Additionally, several full clauses are used to denote times-of-year, e.g.
8-49wurrwubugrass3sgBash-back-bend-Fut-derri-pal -peSU Irr(lit: the grass will be knocked flat)
That time in about May when the long dried out summergrasses are knocked flat by the wind and late showers (known
in the English of Ngan'gityemerri speakers’ as ‘knock ‘em
down time’).","[402, 403]"
"fostering oral rather than written language skills. The school has been
building a collection of video resources, with the assistance of the National
Aboriginal Languages Program, that one day may be ‘patched in’ to local
television transmission.
1.5.3 Approach to Grammar Writing
My approach to writing a grammar of Ngan'gityemerri falls fairly
squarely within the traditions of what Wilkins (1989:58) has referred to as
‘The ANU School of Australian Grammatical Description’. This tradition
places a high priority on the use of descriptive practices that best reflect the
linguistic system in question, and are sensitive to the cultural context of its
usage. Grammars written within this tradition are highly eclectic in their
use of linguistic theory, drawing on whatever grammatical tools best
achieve these descriptive aims, without being overly concerned about, as
Evans (1985:xii) puts it, ""whether they all come from the same toolkit"".
Writers within this tradition employ, and acknowledge their use of,
whatever theories best handle the particular aspect of the language they are
describing. At the same time they are wary of 'fad’ theoretical terminology,
believing that a grammatical description written in the most straightforward
language and containing a large number of natural language examples will
best allow the reader to judge the accuracy and internal consistency of the
description.
I began this description of Ngan’gityemerri with the intention of
providing a full reference grammar of the language. I have been forced to
reduce the scope of this work by the realisation that languages having such
morphological density as this one does, cannot be adequately treated within
the thesis wordlength limitations imposed by the university. This thesis
cannot really be called a ‘grammar’, for it does not adequately cover some
aspects of the language, and others not at all. I have given fairly detailed
descriptions of the phonology and nominal and verbal morphology. As this
is a language in which the verb is “where the action is"", I have further
chosen to explore two of the most interesting aspects of the verb; the
incorporation of bodypart terms into the verbal complex, and the semantics

rha
a
Gerhardt Laves was the first linguist to work on Ngan'gityemerri. In
1931 he collected some 200 pages of vocabulary, auxiliary paradigms,
grammatical notes and (largely untranscribed) texts, in Ngan'gimerri, the
speech variety of the now extinct rak-Merren patri-line. Laves returned tothe USA later that year, and appears not to have published anything from
his Australian data. His works, including detailed studies of Matngela,
Karriyarri, Kumbaingir and Nyungar, remained in the basement of the
library of the University of Chicago until 1985 when Mark Francillon
brought them to the notice of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Studies (then AIAS), who obtained copies in the
following year.
Of all the previous work on Ngan'gityemerri, this is by far the most
exciting, both for the quality of the analysis, and the diachronic evidence it
provides for changes within the Ngan'gityemerri verb structure (see Reid, to
appear). Laves had a good ear and a reasonable grasp of the phonology. He
never really came to grips with the nature of the stop contrast, but had the
presence of mind to keep his ..anscriptions phonetically oriented rather
than risk phonemic under-differentiation.
His segmentation of,
particularly, the partially synthetic verbal morphology was quite perceptive,
even to the extent that he was able to distinguish between complex strings of
morphology that happened to have the same surface form.
Laves' fieldnotes are the only previous work that has made any
significant contribution to this thesis.
Arthur CapellCapell collected some undated fieldnotes on what is probably
Ngan'gimerri, but may be Ngan'giwumirri.
These have never been
published and delays in the organisation of Capell's literary estate have
regrettably prevented me from seeing his work.
Darrell Tryon
As part of his survey of the ‘Daly Family Languages’, Tryon collected
NgK and NgW data during six month fieldtrips in 1967 and 1969. This work
was primarily aimed at a lexico-statistic classification of these languages, but
Tryon also provided the first basic description of the phonology, nominal
morphology, noun classification, verbal morphology and auxiliary classes.
Tryon's work on NgK and NgW is presented in Tryon 1968, 1970 and 1974.","[50, 51, 52]"
"In their copula functions ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘stand’ 'go' and ‘go* are used to
encode the existence/location of, or ascribe attributes to their subjects.
‘Existential’ clauses are simply statements about the existence of entities
with respect to space and time. 'Ascriptive’ clauses employ the simple
intransitive auxiliaries to ascribe certain characteristics to their subjects.
These characteristics can be expressed as either adjectives or throughattributive NP's. As copulas ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘stand’, 'go' and ‘go*' are used for
both inanimate and animate subjects, necessitating a rather broader view of

In many examples though, the relationship between the elements of a
lexical compound verb is compositional and implicit, and not amenable to
description in terms of syntactic rules. Sapir makes similar observations on
noun incorporation in American languages;
""it is often just as difficult, at least in some American languages, to draw
the line between the objective and non-objective use of an incorporated nounas it is to determine the precise syntactic value of the qualifying member of
a compound...In both cases the grammatical expression of a logical relation,
in other words a syntactic process, is sacrificed to a compositional process in
which the logical relation is only implied.”","[224, 225]"

collecting ochres/firewood with some site-mapping, fulfilling Robert's
custodial role in certain estates, and the odd bit of fishing. Patrick Tyabada
frequently accompanied us on these trips, contributing his own stories and
general hilarity. While the bulk of my NgW data comes from a small
number of informants, I have regularly tested its acceptability within the
wider community of NgW speakers (see acknowledgements).
Most of the Peppi community took an interest in my developing
language skills, making an effort to avoid speaking English to me, and
randomly testing my knowledge of words and expressions.
My more
spectacular errors (quite unrepeatable) featured regularly in community
gossip. This level of interest, though occasionally embarrassing, greatly
improved my conversational fluency in NgW.
From the start Ngan'gityemerri people have always been keen to
have their language ‘written down’.
Although I have always been
encouraged by this expression of support, initially I felt uneasy about what
seemed to be two unstated inferences: that the language would somehow be
saved by this process, and secondly that my thesis would constitute some
sort of language resource that they could refer to like a dictionary. My
explanations of what my thesis would and would not be, produced varied
responses. Some people were plainly puzzled; if I was not producing a
resource for native speakers, or drills for language learners, just who would
use this book ? Others were quick to point out my obligations to make
available those products of my work that were of more immediate use, texts
and wordlists particularly.
At Peppimenarti I was actively encouraged to work in the school, and
together with Terry Sam began a school-based language program. Although
we did develop and teach the orthography used here and commence
wordlists for each child, the main focus of this program has always been on
different ‘languages’.
Within a single ‘language’, people listening to a narrative will, in
whisper, query the acceptability of unusual auxiliary(+bodypart)+verbroot combinations,
and derisively hoot at erroneous or implausible ones. Within this context, my discussions
with informants about the acceptability of particular grammatical constructions, was notconsidered particularly odd by them. Of course the responses I got were subject to all sorts of
variables, and where these wereuncontrollable, I have avoided relying on this material atall, unless natural contexts could verify them. So while much of the description contained in
this thesis is based on the grammar of narrative text, and most of the examples cited are
taken from recorded texts, my understanding of such issues as bodypart incorporation and
auxiliary semantics in particular, owes a significant debt to the process of solid formal
elicitation.","[48, 49, 50]"

consistently shorter than the voiceless stop. However it exploits

other articulator types (see 2.2.2). /b/ shows less fluctuation in
closure type than do the other voiced stops, being always fully

is a bilabial fricative [9], lightly spread and with a small degree
of lip tension. Observation of speakers' lip movement shows
this sound to be truly bilabial, in that the teeth are not visible
and the upper and lower lips are aligned and make even
contact. However this sound has some of the turbulent quality
(auditory correlate of energy higher in the spectrum) that is
normally associated with labiodental articulation. The
presence of this turbulence suggests that the lip spread and
tension pulls the top lip sufficiently tightly against the upper
teeth that they act as joint articulators in opposing the bottom
lip. Even if the upper teeth do not actually come into contact
with the lower lip, they at least approach it closely enough to
generate wake turbulence. Among the younger speakers of
Ngan'gityemerri, (who have been exposed to a considerable
amount of Standard English through their schooling and, more
recently, through television), this fricative is usually realised as
a true labiodental [f].
As has been noted for all other Australian languages that have
both a stop contrast and fricatives, the contrast does not extend
to the fricatives (Dixon 1980:215). /f/ is always voiceless
initially, and varies between voiced and voiceless when
intervocalic or post-liquid. /f/ only occurs post-nasally across a
morpheme boundary in which environment it remains
voiceless.

Ngan'giwumirri than it is in Ngan’gikurunggurr. A text count

Ngan'giwumirri, compared with only about 15% in
Ngan'gikurunggurr. Although this variation in the degree of
glottal pulsing through the approximation duration of medial
/£/ is biased differently in each dialect, it is still ‘free’ variation
in the sense that it is non-contrastive within the phonological
system of each dialect’.
Finally, a very minor allophone, a voiceless bilabial fricative
with labiodorsal secondary articulation [$”], has been recorded
as a free variant of word initial [] in a single word only.

markers; that is, the minor phonetic differences between them are strictly and invariablymaintained as evidence of the separate identities of the two groups, usually at other levels
(eg. political). In discussion of these words, speakers will carefully point out that “we say it
this way, but that other mob say it this way"". So despite the non-contrastive nature of thefeature tvoice among fricatives within the phonological systems of each of these languages,
the same feature is employed cross-dialectically, within a subset of the lexicon at least, to
flag linguistic identification. How, within the scope of the general lexicon, certain lexemes
come to be employed in this manner remains a question for further study. Note though that
these kinds of examples nicely illustrate Labov's observation that there is really no such
thing as free variation, if social and stylistic variables are considered to constitute part of
the conditioning environment.","[64, 65, 66]"

Table 9-1
The paradigm is typical of pronominal systems in Daly region
languages, and within prefixing languages generally, in its range of number
categories, and in the restriction of the gender distinction to the 3rd singular
forms only (as is also true of the bound pronominal paradigm).
However, the paradigm cannot be readily accounted for as a single
system. The lack of homogeneity in the categorisation and morphologicalderivation of the 1st inclusive forms on the one hand, and the rest of the
paradigm, on the other, requires that each of these be treated as separate sub-systems.
Looking firstly at the non-Ist singular pronouns, there are three basic
number categories, singular, dual and plural. While dual may be a moremarked category than plural in discourse terms, there is no particular
morphological reason to view either the plural or dual forms as more basic.
A fourth highly marked category, trial, is derived by suffixing the dual form
with -nime.
Among the Ist inclusive pronouns however, there are only two
number categories, there being no distinction between plural and trial. The
Ist inclusive plural/trial pronoun is derived morphologically by adding the
suffix -nime to the dual form. In this respect, viewed from the perspectiveof the non-1st inclusive sub-paradigm, nayin-nime has the formal structure
of a trial form. However given the specifically plural reference of nayinnime, the suffix -nime has clearly different meanings within the two subsystems.
This asymmetry between 1st inclusive and the rest of the paradigm,
has been noted in many prefixing languages. For some of these languages
thisasymmetryis simplytheresultof theirbeingviewedfromasingular/dual/trial/plural perspective. For these languages re-analysis as a
minimal /augmented system has allowed the merging of two apparent subsystems into a single uniform one (see for instance the analysis of the
Rembarrnga pronominal system in McKay 1975). A list of languages
analysed as having minimal/augmented pronominal systems is given in
Dixon (1980:353).
Note though that treating the Idlinc pronoun as a
minimal unit does not resolve the asymmetry evident in the
Ngan'gityemerri pronominal paradigm.","[409, 410, 411]"
"The analysis presented here deals in the concepts of both primary and
secondary stress. In perceptual terms word stress is correlated with two
factors; pitch contour (stressed syllables are pitched higher than unstressedsyllables, in the absence of secondary stresses the pitch contour falls evenly
over subsequent syllables); and amplitude (stressed syllables are generally
‘louder’ than unstressed syllables).
2.5.1Stress on Mono-morphemic Nominals
Stress placement on monomorphemic nominals and free form
grammatical particles and postpositions is relatively straightforward. Theybear primary stress on their initial syllable, and secondary stress on every
second subsequent syllable unless that syllable is word-final. The finalsyllables of a mono-morphemic nominal can never bear stress.

In Ngan'gityemerri reduplication of verbal roots is a widespread and
productive process, but reduplication of nominal roots is essentially
restricted to a finite number of words, mostly animal names, derivedthrough onomatopoeic representation of their cries.
Nominals are always reduplicated in full rather than partially, and
such reduplication involves the copying of full stress marking onto both
elements.",[116]

as an association with ‘eye’, in a verb meaning ‘to put someone to sleep’,
would be quite plausible. However by comparison with the intransitiveverb in 3-143 a) it is apparent that -mi- in 3-143 b) has been applied to the
verb root -bubu to augment its associated monovalent argument structure,
to make its compositional valency compatible with its lexical transitivity.
In 3-144 a) -mi- could conceivably be an applicative prefix augmenting
the valency of the verb root -wat. We could determine this with certainty if,
as in 3-143 above, we could contrast it with an intransitive verb employingthe same verb root. No such verb in fact exists, however we can show that
in this case -mi- is functioning as an incorporated bodypart patterning with-syi- ‘nose’ in 3-144 b). The verb in 3-144means ‘to hang up an object bypassing some sort of hook through it'. The incorporation of -mi- in 3-144 a)
focusses on the ‘eye-like hole’ through which the hook is inserted. Theincorporation of-syi- in 3-144 b), on the other hand, focusses on the ‘nose-like hook’ that is inserted through the hole.
For non-native speakers this method of comparison can be employed
to disambiguate the particular function of -mi- in potentially ambiguous
instances. Needless to say, for native speakers who acquire an implicit feel
for the associated argument structure of verb roots, such a test is needless.
We should also consider the possibility that in verbs like 3-143 a) above,
where an eye association is compatible with the verbal semantics, that -miencodes both grammatical and lexical meaning.
Green (1989) notes in
Marrithiyel that applicative prefixes clearly retain their bodypart semantics.","[173, 174]"
"75NinggiDESPITEThe enclitic -ninggi is discussed in 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 as a case inflection to
NP's in agentive and instrumental roles.
The homophonous form
examined in this section is a freeform particle which occurs in clause-initial
position and is quite unrelated to the case enclitic.
Ninggi designates the clause over which it has scope, as a proposition
from which one could make logical assumptions, assumptions that are then
contradicted in the following clause. This could usefully be explicated as:
‘Even though proposition X would lead you to assume proposition Y, in
fact, illogically, proposition Z is the case’. Proposition Y, as a logical
assumption, would not normally be given. Ninggi typically prefaces
proposition X, as in the examples below.

"|$Having made this claim that speakers of incorporating languages remember
all combinations of 'incorporated noun + verb’ as a lexicalised unit, Mithun
uses this as a basis to draw a distinction between noun incorporation and
other truly . syntactic processes. Speakers of non-incorporating languages,
she argues, do not remember all possible combinations of verb and object.",[223]
"3.5.2Syntactic versus Lexical Incorporation
In characterising the grammatical relations holding between a verb
and the bodypart terms that can be incorporated into it, Evans (to appear)
has shown how a distinction between syntactic and lexical incorporation is
beneficial in the analysis of bodypart incorporation in Mayali, a
Kunwinjkuan
language of south-west Arnhem
Land. Syntactic
incorporation is optional, fully productive and
constrained to certain
predictable grammatical relations between the incorporated nominal and
predicate. Lexically incorporated nominals, on the other hand, may bear a
wider variety of grammatical relations to the incorporating verb and are not
fully productive. Their meaning, which may be compositional or noncompositional, cannot generally be paraphrased by omitting the
incorporated nominal, or by having it appear as an external nominal (loc.cit.).
This kind of analysis can usefully be applied to Ngan'gityemerri,
where syntactic incorporation also operates under fairly rigid constraints on
the nature of the grammatical relations that hold between a bodypart and apredicate. Lexical incorporation, on the other hand, allows a wide variety of
grammatical relations to hold between a bodypart and a predicate, althoughthe nature of these relations is typically vague or variable, as lexicallyincorporated bodyparts tend to lose the semantic characteristics associated
with their freeform occurrence, and function to narrow the scope of the verb
rather than retaining their identity as verbal arguments. For certainbodyparts we show how their effect on the scope of a verb shows signs of
developing into a quasi-classificatory system whereby they are incorporated
in a general sense to qualify verbs that are directed at particular iypes of
entities. Both these types of incorporation are treated in the following
sections.
Only a single slot is available within the verbal structure for
incorporated bodyparts, both syntactic and lexical incorporations competingfor this position.",[218]
"Note also that the practice of forming ‘language’ names through a compound with the word
for ‘language’, does not in any convincing way suggest that the primary reference of these
names is to language rather than people. This is a region where languages are spoken in
continous blocs of country. If you know someone's country, then you know their language, and
vice versa.",[28]

8.3.4Space, Time and Number Emphasis
A favoured construction in Ngan’gityemerri for giving emphasis to
expressions of space, time and number, is to negate their opposites.
Examples of negated spatial and temporal qualifiers have already been given
in 8-11 and 8-56 and 8-57. Although numeric emphasis can be given using
the quantifiers mebuk/mabuk (K)'many' and bakuty ‘many’, again the
favoured construction is to negate an expressed singular quantity. This is
demonstrated in 8-72 and 8-73.

Neg _ one
Hg - hill big
Hg - place

cl
cl = name
There was a huge crowd of women, those from Peppimenarti,those from Nadirri...
Another strategy (seemingly contradictory to the one just mentioned)
in emphasising plural number is to treat a very large group of people as a
singular unit. That is, once reference to the size of group has been
contextually established, thereafter the group will be cross-referenced by
singular pronouns, both freeform and those bound to the verb. This
strategy is demonstrated in 8-74 below, where the term minde-fela-ndi (Neg-person-SAME) is used to mean ‘what a lot of people!'. The crowd is
thereafter referred to as nem ‘he' and pronominally cross-referenced on the
verb as 3rd person singular.","[408, 409]"
"Punctual verbs can only be punctual and are therefore blocked from
selecting the Past Imperfective auxiliary inflection, which, as noted above,
overtly encodes imperfective aspect. A punctual verb like ‘shoot’ can only

Note though that a punctual verb can be made amenable to an ‘extended

iteration, morphologically encoded by the reduplication of the verb root,
makes possible an ‘extended over time' interpretation, and is permissive of
imperfective auxiliary inflection.

Contrastively, neutral verbs have the capacity to select either

Regardless of whether a transitive verb belongs to the punctual or
neutral class, in the absence of any overt morphology specifying its internal
temporal constituency, its unmarked form is conceptually perfective in the
sense that it is perceived of as a single event. Examples 3-226 and 3-227
above,
for instance, though the first is neutral and the second punctual, are
expressed as single events with no information given regarding theiraspectual make-up. To this extent, 'perfectivity' can be said to be the
unmarked aspectual category in Ngan'gityemerri.

Section 6.1 examines the way in which NPs can be, though are notobligatorily, marked for certain case functions with a set of enclitics (see for
instance, ‘agentive' -ninggi in 5-113 above). Note though that nominalised
clauses functioning as verbal arguments, as in 5-114 to 5-116, cannot have
their local or syntactic case roles marked with these enclitics. In the same
way that case enclitics are freely omitted from even simple NPs, this is
unlikely to result in ambiguous relations with the verb, as the role of the
nominalised clause will generally be evident from the thematic content andthe meaning of the predicate. Where the role of a nominalised clause
requires overt specification, this can be achieved by attaching the case
enclitic to the anaphoric demonstrative, as demonstrated in 5-116.
Consistent with the unconstrained roles that nominalised clauses canfill as arguments of the verb, there are likewise no constraints on the types
of relations that can hold between the head generic and the verb of thenominalised clause. Thus in 5-113 and 5-116 the head of the nominalised
clause is the S of the intransitive nominalised verb, in 5-112 it is the O, and
in 5-115 where the generic nominalises a merrendi subordinate clause (cf.
6.2.3), the head is not an argument of the nominalised verb at all.",[344]

Hoddinott and Kofod collected a vast amount of data on primarily
NgK, but also NgW, between 1967 and 1982. Hoddinott was preparing a
grammar of NgK at the time of his death in late 1984. Kofod carried on with
the project and a grammar entitled 'The Ngankikurungkurr Language (Daly
River Area, Northern Territory)’ (Pacific Linguistics, Series D, No. 77), was(4published in 1988, My analysis of this language differs from their work in
numerous ways (some minor, some major). It is not possible to provide a
thorough critique of the Hoddinott and Kofod analysis within this thesis.
Consequently, although I've made occasional reference to their work at
appropriate places through the text (usually as footnotes), no attempt has
been made to rigorously defend my analyses in view of their previous work.
To indicate the nature of the difficulties with their analysis, a rather ad hoc
selection of four points is given below.
- H&K do not acknowledge that the speech variety they describe is a
mixture of the more traditional language of older speakers and the modern
variety that I call New-Ngan'gikurunggurr (see 1.4.2.)
- H&K's phonology chapter is clearly a jumbled collation of
competing draft analyses. Kofod acknowledges in the preface that she had
the difficult task of producing a final draft from assorted earlier versions.
However her claim to have done so is not borne out in the text.
In the
discussion of stop consonants, for example, successive paragraphs jump
unannounced from a 'voice' analysis to a ‘length’ analysis. The claim (p 10)
that “voiced and voiceless phonemes contrast initially and medially"" is
followed (p 11) by the observation that ""stops are normally long in
medial...position"" (the latter claim suggestive of their being no contrast at
all).
- Ngan’gityemerri is a head-marking language that obligatorily crossreferences core arguments on the verb with bound pronominal affixes. The
pattern of core argument crossreferencing is strictly nominative /accusative.
Both S and A arguments are cross-referenced by a single set of prefixes to the
auxiliary root. Arguments in O function are cross-referenced with another
set of suffixes to the auxiliary root. Hé&K claim that Ngan'gikurunggurr is
an ergative language (H&K 1988:205). They base their claim on the function
of -ninggi, an enclitic which attaches to nouns filling instrumental and
agentive roles. Having the primarily discourse function of clarifying agency,
-ninggi is not an obligatory NP constituent, nor is it precluded from
attaching to nouns that are the subjects of low-transitive verbs. To base a
claim about ergativity solely on this discourse marker, and ignore the verbalcross-referencingthat is the primarymechanismfor encodingcoreparticipant roles in Ngan'gityemerri, is unsatisfactory.
- H&K's analysis of auxiliary-final nasals is particularly weak.
Although they correctly hear nasal gemination across the boundary betweenthe subject number marker and the auxiliary root (H&K p 40), their response
to the same phenomenon at the auxiliary-final boundary is to write a
morphophonemic rule that reduces underlying geminate nasals to singlenasals (H&K p 28).","[52, 53, 54]"
"The
names
Ngan'gikurunggurr
and
Ngan’giwumirri
are
etymologically compounds of ngan'gi ‘language/story/word' and
kurunggurr and wumirri. Kurunggurr is both the name of a particular
billabong in the muyil marshland west of Peppimenarti, and also the
general term, in both Ngan'gikurunggurr and Ngan'giwumirri, for deep,
dark water, as found midstream in a river. Ngan'gikurunggurr people do
not prefer either one of these referents, as opposed to the other, as the source
of the language name. The etymology of wumirri is not clear. In response
to my queries, some Ngan'giwumirri people have remarked upon the
similarity with wumirr ‘the resinous substance found among the roots of
the ironbark tree’. There is however no general agreement about the
relevance of this similar term to the language name, nor any supporting
morphological evidence (i.e. the final -i is otherwise unattested as any sort
of derivational suffix).
Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr are, on linguistic criteria,
dialects of a single language. They share an identical phonemic inventory
(though realisation and stress rules differ); share identical verbal structure the number and semantics of their systems of auxiliary verb appear to map
onto each other perfectly; they share a cognacy rate of about 85%; and are
mutually intelligible. Speakers of these dialects refer to them as ‘languages’,
and acknowledge their subgrouping by comparing their degree of similarity
with other pairs of dialects - ""NgK and NgW go level, like Marrithiyel and
Marrisjebin go level"".
Speakers of both dialects agree that NgK is
‘light/smooth' while NgW is ‘heavy/rough’.

"In addition to the ‘language’ group affiliations noted above,
performers articulate the differences between wangga and lirrga in terms of
minor structural phenomena; for instance wangga singers signal the end of
a song to the bamboo-man with three small taps of the sticks, but lirrga
singers do this by singing ‘ny ny ny’.
In addition to songstyle affiliations claimed through one's patriline,
all males who have been through the circumcision stage of initiation have
an affilation with the songstyle that was performed at the moment that they
were cut. This affiliation is expressed in such terms as; ""I was cut lirrgaway, so even though I'm a wangga man (by patrilineal affiliation), if I was .
visiting on the Wagiman side (who are lirrga by patrilineal affiliation) then
they'd know me over there"". This kind of affiliation is also expressed in the
use of songstyle terms as names for men. Any man can be indirectly referred
to, or directly addressed, by the songstyle associated in this manner with his
circumcision (see the reference to Warrigal Martin as ‘lirrga' throughout
most of Text 1 in Appendix C. Being Marrisjebin, Warrigal inherits and
performs the wangga songstyle, but was cut lirrga-way). Calling to someone
