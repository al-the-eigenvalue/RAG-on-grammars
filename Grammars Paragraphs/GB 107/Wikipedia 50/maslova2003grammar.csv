"The Negative Main forms are identicalfor transitive and intransitive verbs(Jochelson 1905; Krejnovich1982:203-204): the first and second person markers are taken from
the Intransitive Main paradigm, the third person marker is zero
(for intransitive verbs, the regular 3sG marker -7 is possible aswell), see Table 15.
The Imperative forms take the regular negative prefix, yet the
negative counterpart of the simple Imperative forms contains also
the Prohibitive suffix (Table 14); see 2.8 for examples. For further
details on negation, see 79.4,

be attached only to a Main form. The overt. Affirmative marker
is by no means obligatory, that is, the finite verb of an affirmative sentence is normally not overtly marked for polarity.2° The
only exception is the Irrealis form, which is most often used in
combination with the Affirmative marker; sce 2.4. Otherwise, the
Affirmative marker can be used in order to emphasize the assertion
expressed by the finite verb.",[164]

Generally, negative quantifiers and adverbials are built by meansof the prefix n’e- added to the interrogative pro-forms (see 7.1.4.2);the negative quantifier for human participants is nilg? ‘nobody’.
A negative pro-form requires the presence of standardnegationNegation495within the same clause. Two negative pro-forms can be combinedwithin onc clause (864d).

This construction is made up exactly as its Russian counterpart,
including the formal identity of the negative prefix used with thepro-forms (cf, the Yukaghir standard negative marker in (863a) in
a formally similar construction, which is, however, far less frequent.
than the construction with n’e). Therefore, it seems plausible to
consider this construction a loan from Russian. An additional
piece of evidence in favor of this hypothesis is given by Tundra
Yukaghir, where there are no negative pro-forms with n’e; instead,
contrastive/free-choice pro-forms are used in negative sentences(Krejnovich 1982:222-225).
4.2.2. The negative marker n’e with nouns
In some examples, the negative marker n’e occurs in prenominal
position, in combination with standard negation on the verb, with
a meaning like ‘not even’ or ‘neither ...nor...’:?","[514, 515]"

2.1.3. The contrastive/negative particle eil’e
The particle efl’e has the general semantic effect of contrasting two
propositions, one of which remains implicit. The implicit proposition is presented as false, in contrast with that expressed by theclause. This particle is used in Indicative sentences (2.1.3.1), in
tag questions (2.1.3.2), and for negative responses (2.1.3.3).
2.1.3.1. In Indicative sentences, the clause-final particle ell’e is
used to contrast the proposition expressed in the clause to what
might be presupposed (823a), apparently evident {823b), expected(823c), or desired (823d):

Instead of the negated SS form (cf. (866b)), the special Negative
(Privative) form can be used, but the latter construction has an
additional contrastive effect (6.1.4.8).","[515, 516]"

‘Somebody was walking between their house and the

Negative pronouns are derived from Interrogatives by means of
the prefix n’e. The only exception is the negative pronoun nilgi‘nobody’ (i.e., the negative counterpart of kin ‘who’), see (471c).(471) a. jug-tn’e-qodojup-t[see-SS:IPFV][see-SS:IPFV]n’e-leme-leelNEG-what-INSTRNEG+see(NEG:3SG)NEG-howjug‘He kept on looking, but could not see anything at252Chapter 7.

See 13.4.2 for the use of these forms.
1.4.3. Free-choice indefinite pronouns
Finally, there is a Russian-like means to derive free-choice indefinite pronouns, namely, the morpheme kos ~ kug (from Russian
hot’ ‘at least, if only’) can be prefixed to an Interrogative pronoun,
possibly in combination either with the negative prefix or with the
marker of indefiniteness:(472)a. kus-kin-de —— mil-l’el-de-jne

‘All people who were passing by, coming and going

rather flexible morphological pattern.
1.4.4. The Indefinite pronoun sar ‘something’
The Indefinite pronoun Jar means either ‘something’ (more rarely,
‘somebody’) (473), or, if used as a modifier, ‘some (of), any’ (474).","[270, 271, 272, 273]"
"This ne can be assumed to be just the Russian negative marker.
Krejnovich (1982:151} gives the whole person /number paradigm of this
verb, yet all forms but those of second person appear to be out of use.",[610]
"The Privative formThe Privative form (‘without X’) is built by the combination of

1.4.8. Functions of the Negative converb
The Negative converb is formally identical and semantically close
to the nominal Privative form (see 5.5.2). This form signifies that
the expectable accompanying event did not take place. If the
idea of counter-expectation is absent, the negated forms of other166Chapter6.","[185, 186]"

"Chapter13Sentence types and negationThis chapter deals with grammatical manifestation of illocutionarydistinctions (Sections 1-3) and negation (Section 4). Yukaghir
distinguishes Declarative sentences (which are not discussed as
such), Imperative sentences (Section 1), polar (2.1) and questionword questions (2.2), and two minor types: Exclamations (3.1)
and Optative sentences (3.2).
The verb forms used in major sentence types are described in
6.1.1; this chapter is concerned with syntactic properties associated with distinct types, in particular, their characteristic particles(2.1.2, 2.1.3, 3.2).
Section 5 describes the syntactic strategies of reporting the contents of a speech act, including the attested peripheral uses of these
strategies.
1. ImperativesentencesThe imperative sentence type is distinguished by means of verb
morphology, that is, by use of the Imperative verb forms (see
6.1.1). Therefore, this sentence type is described and exemplified
in 6.2.8; this section contains only some marginal notes.
In order to propose a common action (i.e., instead of the 1PL
Imperative), the main (Indicative) 1PL form can be used, with or,
less frequently, without the Future marker (see also 6.2.3).","[492, 493]"

See also Section 3 on the connective function of the form tat. Note
that these means of referring to a previously described situation
are generally not applied if the main predicate of the given sentenceis the same as in a preceding clause (for this case, see 2.2).
2.2, Links between same-type situations
There are several grammatical means to combine or to establish
an explicit link between clauses referring to semantically similar
situations, i.e., situations which can be signified by means of the
same verb (in a particular case, between clauses describing thesame referential situation). Such a link can be established either
by means of a connective particle (2.2.1-2.2.2) or by using a single
verb form for both situations (2.2.3).
2.2.1. The connective particle aj ~ ajz ‘too, again, still’
The particle aj is employed to link a clause to a clause referring to
a (semantically) similar situation, most often signified by the same
verb. In the simplest case, the situations linked by means of this
particle are just two occurrences of the same situation, with the
same sets of participants. In this case the particle can be glossed
as ‘again’ (if the clause describes the second occurrence of thesituation, (913), (914)) or ‘too’ (if it describes the first occurrence
(914)). The clauses involved need not be adjacent (e.g., in (913a)
two instances of the particle refer back to two different preceding
clauses). The particle takes the preverbal position:(913)a. tamun-ge

‘Old man, old man, you are cheating again.’ [F19]
If such clauses are adjacent, the particle can occur in both of them(914a). Note that the linear order of the clauses can be reversed
with respect to the temporal order of the situations (914b):

The same’particle can link clauses describing similar situationswith distinct sets of involved participants. The examples in (915)
illustrate the case where the situations differ in one participant
slot. In (916), the participants are rearranged with respect to
their roles in the situation. If the NP representing the changed
participant is not adjacent to the verb form, the particle normallytakes the postnominal position (916b)(otherwise, the preverbaland postnominal positions cannot be distinguished). If this NP
is marked as the grammatical Focus, the particle takes the pre-nominal position (see (915d), (919a)).1°4530(915)Chapter14.","[547, 548, 549, 550]"
"The Syntaz is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less traditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinctions expressedin Yukaghir,that is, the constructions are classi-fied according to functional considerations, which helps to high-light the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplifyvarious constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the onehand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of information on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the “boundaries” set. by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contradictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant fragments of fhe grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the grammar (c.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the16Chapter1. Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977} and Language Typology and Syntactic Description (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describethe language “in its own terms”.
3.3. Data for this study and exemplification
This grammar is based on two types of data: authentic texts in
contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir and linguistic interviews with its
native speakers (see Acknowledgmenis). My text database comprises texts published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1989 and texts writtendown by Nikolay Vakhtin (1987) and myself (1987, 1992);* some
of the latter are published in (Maslova 2001), and some are included in this grammar {sce Appendix 3); in order to increase thereliability of data, al] controversial and/or questionable sentences
of these texts have been double-checked with native speakers.?
As discussed in Chapter 2, Kolyma Yukaghir has been under
strong pressure from Russian for at least several decades. This,
in combination with the well-known methodological drawbacks of
interviews, makes this sort of data far less reliable than those
elicited from authentic texts. That is why I tried to use only
text examples for illustrative purposes. As a result, some of these
examples might seem too long and complex for the point they are
intended to illustrate. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
an authentic sentence “simplified” by a linguist for some didactic
purposes is not a reliable cxample anymore. In the case of such
languages as Yukaghir, the “unnecessary” complexity of examples
is the price to be paid for reliability of data. Even if I had a
simpler and, in some sense, “clearer” example in my field notes,
I always chose in favor of a text example.° In some cases, whereAboutthis grammar17this seemed to be inevitable, I did “shorten” illustrative sentences;
note that all such omissions are shown by <...>; such examples
should not be taken as “complete sentences”.
There is, of course, a range of pheuomena which cannot be
appropriately described in this fashion because they are absent or
rare in the texts, but are readily produced by my informants in an
interview. ‘These phenomena are described in the grammar on the
basis of my field notes, but with explicit reservations concerning
the source of the data. If an example elicited in an interviewis included in the grammar (in order to avoid loss of significant
information), the source is indicated by the letter “I” after the
idiomatic translation.

‘Like people who do not know even a bit (about how

recent borrowings from Russian, having no function but to makea word more Yukaghir-like,e.g., Juka-die ‘pike’ (from Russianshchuka ‘pike’), ajka-die ‘sea gull’ (from Russian chajka ‘sea
gull’). In particular, this device is commonly applied to Russianfirst names, e.g., Aleks’ej-die, Egor-die, Miqajla-die (in each word,
the first component is just a Russian male name).","[149, 150]"
"Inother words, the widely known “focus prominence” of Yukaghir
has to be understood, in the case of Kolyma Yukaghir, in a rather458Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusspecific fashion:it is not a language which marks which elementof a (finite) clause represents the Focus of this clause. Rather, it
is a language which marks each finite clause for whether or not itsS/O participant is the Focus.
If the S/O constituent represents the only element within thescope of assertion (narrow focus) or its contrastive part, Focus
marking is compulsory (3.1). Conversely, if this constituent is
excluded from the scope of assertion, only the neutral packaging
option is available. Between these poles, the Focus marking is
applied to delimit the assertion rendered by the given clause fromthe preceding material.","[477, 478]"
"In the most general terms,the effect of Russian contact onKolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from origi-nal Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obligative modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construction with a Russian predicative loanword nado ‘is-necessary’ and anominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:(16)a. tamunmin-ginadothat
take-POSS necessary
‘It is necessary to take it.’
b. tamunthatmin-mozetake-PRSP{TR:1SG)‘It, is necessary /inevitable to take it, I should take it.’KolymaandTundraYukaghir27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out’ Yukaghir synthetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yukaghir has a verbal suffix -7- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
cither in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b}. Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to that found in many European languages (including Russian),eg, (17c):
(17)a. tabud-ek— jug-jt-melethis-PRED look-PURP-OF:3SG
‘He went to look at this.’b. ans t-ga-t
keure-s”
|search-PURP-SS:IPFV] go-PFV:INTR:3S8G
‘He went to look for it.’
c. ans’i-din
kewe-s’
search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
‘He went to look for it.’
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the pat-terns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yukaghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).
5. Kolymaand TundraYukaghirThe Kolyma aud Tundra Yukaghir languages used to be described
as dialects. which seems to be misleading in view of the significant28Chapter 2. KolymaYukaghir and its speakersdistinctions in lexicon, grammar, and phonology. Presumably due
to the extensive language contacts, the lexical distinctions cven
within the basic vocabulary are so great that glottochronological
counts give ca. 2000 years of divergence (Nikolaeva and Helimsky
1997:155-156). The grammatical divergent features seem to have
been underestimated in previous studies of Yukaghir, probably
because neither of the grammars was known well enough. That
is why both existing monographs on Yukaghir (Krejnovich 1938;
1982) treat the two languages together, although some divergent
features are mentioned. The present grammar deviates from this
tradition and treats Kolyma Yukaghir as a distinct language to bedescribed in its own right.","[46, 47, 48]"

The most frequent meaning of the Inferential is the hearsay evidential; in this meaning, it is used for narration, if the speaker
describes events which he has not witnessed himself (Jochelson
1905; Krejnovich 1982:140), in particular in fairy tales and mythological stories. In this case, the Inferential is the major form used
throughout the story (see Text 1, and all the examples in the grammar where the meaning of the Inferential is not rendered in the
idiomatic translation). In contrast to this, the events in which the
speaker participated himself, or otherwise witnessed, are narrated
in the simple non-Future form (see Text 2). In the following picce
of a text, the speaker switches from the simple form in the firsttwo clauses (which describe situations witnessed by him himself}
to the Inferential in the next one, referring to a more remote time
which he could only hear about.",[192]
"Anovermewof KolymaYukughtr grammer3There arc two kinds of harmonic alternations which can be
conventionally termed palatal and labial, yet both affect only a
very restricted number of suffixes, only one of which is produc-tive. Palatal harmony contrasts the vowels /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/
(with their long counterparts) and the vowels /a/, /o,/ (with their
long counterparts); to some extent, it also determines distribution
of the velar obstruents and their uvular counterparts. Labial har-mony produces the alternation /e/ ~ /o/ in some suffixes after
roots with /o/ or /o/ in the first syllable.
Word stress is mobile; to a large extent, it is determined by the
syllable structure: closed syllables and open syllables with long
vowels attract the stress to the end of a word.
2.2. MorphologyYukaghir is a highly synthetic and essentially agglutinative language; suffixation prevails. There are five prefixes (two prefixes
of polarity, the reflexive, the reciprocal, and the prefix of irrealis);
these morphemes are characterized by a looser connection with
the stem than the suffixes, so that the boundary between a prefix
and its stem may be described as internal open juncture. Fusion
phenomena at morphemic boundaries are marginal.
The major open classes of lexical items are nouns and verbs;
they can be easily distinguished by morphological criteria. Words
denoting qualities constitute a sub-class of verbs; in the attributivefunction, they take the verbal Attributive form (see (5)).
2.2.1.","[22, 23]"
"Furthermore, it can be ratedas “corrupted” not only by the previous generation, but by the
speakers themselves. Yet, to some extent, this strategy of “survival
through modification” is approved by the oldest speakers, that is,the speakers of the “purest” existing variety: they themselves do
use a special simplified Yukaghir-based jargon when addressing
younger people, just in order to be understood, yet to maintain
communication in their mother tongue.
Now, it is clear that this strategy has been applied at least
since the end of the 19% century, which means that the current
group of “best speakers” used to represent a “corrupted” version
a couple of dozens years ago. Some of them are aware of the
differences between their own language and the language their
parents used to speak(occasionally, myquestions were answeredlike “I would say it this way, but my father would have said it
differently”). Even more so, they are aware of “mistakes” in the
language spoken by their fellow-citizens, hence low ratings of their
language competence.",[44]
"2.3.2. Clause chaining
Kolyma Yukaghir makes extensive use of clause chaining, where
non-finite verb forms marked for switch reference (converbs) are
used for all clauses except the final one:(10)a. tatgonu-tjud-de-geomnt[CA go-SS:IPFV][see-3SG-Ds][people alléumuinzu-lel-niasleep-INFR-3PL:INTR|

The range of functions covered by the converbs in Kolyma Yukaghir is extremely broad. Clause chaining is the main strategy
for describing a sequence of temporally adjacent or related events,
as well as for conditional and concessive constructions. This construction is also regularly used to describe the situation of perception, where the situation being perceived is expressed as the finiteclause (cf. (10a)}. Another noteworthy application of converbs is
for aspect-like internal structuring of a single event, as in (9c) and
(10d).
2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nominal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject(11a), the direct object (11b), the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), aud the Possessor of the intransitive subject (11d).

3. Aboutthis grammar8.1. Purpose
The history of Yukaghir studies features the names of two brilHant researchers, Woldemar Jochelson and Eruhim Krejnovich,
who have provided the basic grammatical descriptions of the Yukaghir languages (Jochelson 1898; 1900; 1905; Krejnovich 1955;
1958; 1968; 1979; 1982). The Kolyma Yukaghir language has beenbriefly described by Jochelson (1905) and Krejnovich (1979); the
former source(which is apparentlybest knownto the English-reading audience) is based on the rich data collected by Jochelson
at the end of the XIX“ century (1898; 1900}. Krejnovich’s essay in Encyclopedia of the languages of Asia and Africa (1979)
is based both on Jochelson’s materials and on Krejnovich’s ownAbout this grammer13data collected in 1959. Finally, Krejnovich’s last work (1982) represents the most detailed and comprehensive source of information
on arange of significant issues for both Yukaghir languages. These
works constitute the major sources of first-hand data on Kolyma
Yukaghir,’ which have served as the basis for a number of papers
dealing with some specific topics, as well as for typological studiesinvolving Yukaghir data. A detailed description of Kolyma Yukaghir phonology based on new field data constitutes a part of Irina
Nikolaeva’s unpublished Ph.D. thesis (1988b).
Thus, there is no book which might serve as a reference grammar of Kolyma Yukaghir. Further, some important aspects of thelanguage have not been described at all. This grammar is intended
to fill that gap, drawing both on the previous descriptions of Yukaghir and on the results of my own field work, and thus to make
Kolyma Yukaghir data available for further studies, as well as for
cross-linguistic research.”
The grarmmar attempts to cover all attested forms and constructions of contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir; in this restricted
sense, it is intended to be comprehensive. It is clear, however,
that no single book can provide a truly “comprehensive” description of any human language, at least not at the present stage ofdevelopment of linguistics. Writing a grammar inevitably involves
making a number of choices, so that some aspects of the language
structure may be described and exemplified in more detail, others
only briefly sketched, and possibly some may be omitted from the
description. Insofar as such decisions have been made consciously,
I have attempted to write this grammar in such a way as to “let
the language speak”, rather than to force it to answer any particular theoretically pre-determined questions. In other words, I
have tried to concentrate on those constructions and grammatical
distinctions that, appear to be of importance in Yukaghir grammar and discourse, rather than on those that play a major role in
current linguistic theories.","[30, 31, 32, 33]"

1.1.2. Copular descriptive clauses
The copular pattern is the only option if the subject of a descriptive clause is first or second person:Clauses with nominal predicates(763)a. met

The bound copula form -/ 76- can also be used in this construction,
although such examples are less common; see (764). Somewhat
unexpectedly, the bound variant, in contrast to the free variant,allows Plural and Possessive marking on the noun:*®

1.1.3. Headless relative clauses as nominal predicates
Headless relative clauses (see 17.3.3} can be used as nominal pred-icates, both with the copula o- (770) and in the Predicative form
(771)-(772). In this construction, the subject of a descriptive
clause is identified with (or described as) the relativized participant.
If the relativized participant is the subject, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the subject of the relative clause.
Thus, the whole construction has a single subject NP which is de-442Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusscribed as the primary participant of the relative clause situation.
The resulting structure is similar to that of a simple clause, the
only difference being the “complex” form of the verb; see (770)-(771).","[458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"
"This construc-tion is built as the combination of the optative particle gonoho and
the Result Nominal form (6.1.3.4) of the verb. The construction
is subjectless; the implied primary participant of the situation is
the speaker.",[510]
"‘What woman would it be?’ [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -iek ascribes aproperty to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as ‘The thing I will
give to you is a fox’. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin ‘one’:(168)a. tat

"AccentsandvarietiesGiven the small number of speakers nowadays, any notes about
dialectal or social varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir can only be speculative. However, the currently spoken idiolects are so distinct
as to prevent the best Yukaghir speakers from rating each other’s
language competence highly; Table 5 shows that not one got the
highest rating for language competence from any expert. These
distinctions, as well as the reluctance to acknowledge each other’s
competence, seem to result from two factors of language variation:
First, the Yukaghirs currently living in Nelemnoye represent
two regional groups of Yukaghirs which used to exist before the
collectivization in 1931, One group roamed mainly along the Korkodon River, the other along the Yasachnaya River. These groups
apparently spoke two distinct varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir. The
most notable phonological distinction concerned the labial vowel
harmony, which was characteristic of the Korkodon variety and is24Chapter 2. KolymaYukaghir and its speakersstill maintained in the speech of some Kolyma Yukaghirs; one of
my consultants, A. E. Shadrina, a daughter of a Korkodon Yukaghir, regularly labializes vowels in suffixes after /o/, which distinguishes her accent from that spoken by most of my consultants.
The same distinction was described by E. A. Krejnovich on thebasis of her father’s accent (Krejnovich 1982:21-22).
Secondly, and most importantly, the Kolyma Yukaghir language
is undergoing an extremely fast modification, so that the varieties
of the language spoken even by neighboring generations are clearly
distinct. This seems to be a part of the survival strategy cho-sen by the language in the aggressive sociolinguistic environment.
Each gencration faces a simple choice: given that their mother
tongue is not their first language, they can either reject speaking
that language and let it disappear, or simply speak as they can(cf.","[43, 44]"

Most often, the indirect question takes the sentence-final position,

signal either the coreference of the primary participant with the
speaker (880a) or its coreference with the subject of the matrix

indirect question cannot be viewed as a quotation.",[526]
