"11.3 New patterns of grammar
The history of the !Xun language is characterized on the one hand by conservatism; on the
other hand, there were also changes in all dialects, leading to the rise of new discourse pat-tems and functional categories that we discussed in the preceding chapters. These changes
Were generally in accordance with principles of grammaticalization (Heine & Kuteva 2002,
2007), affecting individual dialects or groups of dialects. A detailed study of these changesStill needs to be done; in the present section we are satisfied with illustrating them with a fewxamples. These examples concern processes that can be traced back to the stage of Proto'Xun and hence had an impact on all dialects, thereby contributing to the typological unity of
the language.
One such grammaticalization process is provided by the development of Proto-!Xun *1!4
from a noun ‘inside, burrow’ to a weakly grammaticalized postposition ‘in, at’ (see section
52): all modern dialects have undergone this process; hence, there is good reason to reconStuct it back to the hypothetical ancestor language. Other similar processes, leading from
Nouns such as *ma‘child, offspring’, *de ‘mother’, and *kx’ad‘owner’, to derivational suf-fixes (see section 6.2.1) were mentioned in section 11.1 above.
Another process, one that must have been concluded at the stage of Proto-!Xun, concerned
the noun */’ae ‘body’, which developed into a reflexive category” (see section 4.1.4). All
Modern dialects have retained the nominal possessive syntax of the construction, where dis-other languages tends to be expressed by the serial verb construction and clause coordinatllinctions in personal deixis are expressed by possessive attributes (e.g. *mi l’ae ‘my body’ >
Myself’), A further process that we hypothesize to have taken place at the earliest time that is
accessible via historical reconstruction relates to the verb *nllan ‘leave, let go’, which is atsted as a negative imperative marker in virtually all dialects (section 8.1).",[166]

A sentence consists minimally of a verb; the verb therefore forms the core of an utterance.
Ignoring question words, adverbs and auxiliary elements that may also appear in the verbphrase, the order of main constituents is as summarized in table 3-1. With the exception of the
verb stem (and in W2 and E3 the topic marker), none of these constituents is obligatory. Theverb stem may be extended either by the transitive suffix *-a (section 3.5) or by derivational
extensions (section 6.2.2).

the same sentence structure: the subject (a pronoun) precedes the verb while the object follows it, the negation marker (NEG) is placed between subject and verb, and there is no inflectional morphology involved.
But there are further similarities. The noun /x6 is unmarked for case, gender, number, ordefiniteness. That /xd is the object of the sentence can be derived from its placement after the
verb; if the order of the two noun phrases were reversed, as in the following example, the case
functions also would be reversed:cd Bonny Sands (p.c.), in contrast, argues that there should be [e] > [ae] rather than [ae] > [e], with the diph-thongization accounted for by repairing the Back Vowel Constraint. We agree that this issue requires much

under7.3.2 Comparison
There are two different constructions to form a comparative of inequality, referred to respectively as the action schema (“‘X is Y surpasses Z”) and the polarity schema (“X is Y, Z is not
Y”; Heine 1997a, 1997b). The ‘surpass’-verb figuring in the former schema functions as the
second verb (V2) in a serial verb construction; it has the following dialect distribution:kaHesurpass N4-PR— !x6wasya_——silalla.and — elephantTOPNIbig#holéwayamalilf tadogTOPNismallof verbs that in someway or other express the notion of a= mima&«kéDETe)ha.",[122]
"NEGseeNl‘The elephant doesn’t see him.’Furthermore, /xd could be singular or plural, and it could be definite or indefinite, that is,
the two sentences above could — depending on the context — receive any of the following
translations:(a) ‘He doesn’t see an elephant.’
(b) ‘He doesn’t see the elephant.’
(c) ‘He doesn’t see elephants.’
(d) ‘He doesn’t see the elephants.’
The verb is also unmarked; it could — again depending on the context — receive various other
tense or aspect interpretations, e.g., ‘He will not see’, ‘He did not see’, or ‘He has not seen’.
What these observations are meant to show is, first, that !Xun is structurally fairly uniform
across its dialects; second, that it makes relatively little use of grammatical forms such as
inflections and, third, that it is highly context-dependent (see Heine & Kénig 2005). This doesnot mean that the language is devoid of functional categories; as we will see in the chapters to
follow, all dialects dispose of a range of categories to express grammatical distinctions.
The examples presented above show that similarities between the two dialects are not reStricted to structure; rather, they also concern the form of grammatical units: it is only the
form for ‘see’ that differs, all other units are the same. This however is not a trivial difference:
W3 speakers do not understand E1 speakers and vice versa — that is, the two dialects are mutually unintelligible. This is not only due to lexical differences, such as the one between W3ne and E1 46, differences also relate to grammatical forms and categories, as we will see beow.
To conclude, there is considerable diversity, especially between the NW- and the SEbranches. Nevertheless, overall the dialects exhibit roughly the same typological profile. Per-haps the main characteristics of the language are:(a) The phonology is more complex than that of most other languages in the world, the number of distinct phonemes exceeding one hundred in all dialects (see chapter 2).",[15]

"248The !Xun languageEl8.2.2 Word questions
Like sentence questions, word questions require the presence of a question particle (see section 8.2 above); under certain conditions, however, the particle can be omitted (see Snyman1970: 196 for E1).
In a number of NW-!Xun dialects there occurs a fossilized nasal prefix *m- (occasionally
*n- before alveolar consonants) in question words; for examples, see below. This prefix is
also retained before verbs in some ritualized expressions, such as the greeting formula in thenléréarea-W2a428SG_Qn-te’a.ahan,mimé_tea.sleepyeslsGTOP _sleep‘Yes, I slept.’ (early morning greeting)‘Did you sleep?’Interrogative attribute ‘which?’
The attribute marker *né ‘which?’ follows its head noun, its equivalents in the various dialects being:
P-X| *néNlniW2cL+]éW3hatéClxeE2E34macftehni?","[127, 128]"
"Of all these branches it is SE-!Xun which experienced the most profound grammatical
change (but see also chapter 10 on personal pronouns). This was made possible via the grammaticalization of the transitive suffix *-a to a relative clause marker. Since this suffix is found
in all dialects on both verbs (see section 3.5) and nouns (section 6.1), we hypothesize that it
had this dual function already at the stage of Proto-!Xun, allowing not only verbs but also
nouns to take an additional complement. The innovation characterizing SE-!Xun was that tt
underwent a common grammaticalization process, extending the use of *-a from nominal to
clausal participants — with the effect that SE-!Xun created a new and highly productive relativizer -4, which was not only employed for presenting clauses but also demonstratives and
some interrogative words (section 9.2.2.3).
That grammatical forms serving the introduction of nouns are grammaticalized to clause
subordinators is a cross-linguistically common process: most languages have undergone it Mt
some way or other.' We argue that in SE-!Xun the transitive suffix underwent what in gral:
maticalization theory is called divergence: whereas the relativizer -4 retained its stable ton®the transitive suffix on both verbs and nouns lost its tone, assimilating to the tone of the pre
ceding syllable.
The change that this development introduced in the SE-dialects El, E2 and E3 was the following: Proto-!Xun must have been a verb-prominent, head-marking language, where gram-matical relations within the sentence were encoded primarily in the verb. With the rise of
highly productive mechanism of relativization, a number of functions expressed by verb seu
alization shifted to some extent to the noun phrase. For example, like in many other Afric321Conclusionsin !Xun. In SE-!Xun, relativization of verbs of state turned into the primary means of expressing adjectival concepts.
Another, related change in SE-!Xun concerned number, leading to a dramatic increase in
plural marking: generalization of the noun class 2 marker *si as a plural marker in relativization, producing the relative clause markers -a (singular) and -s-d (< *-si + -a; plural) in all
three SE-!Xun dialects (see chapter 4). Whereas in NW- and Central !Xun noun phrases are
most of the time unmarked for number — a situation that we hypothesize to also have characterized Proto-!Xun — number marking in SE-!Xun is to some extent (though not entirely)
mandatory. Nevertheless, even in SE-!Xun dialects, non-human nouns are not generally
marked for number. Thus, in the following example from the E1 dialect, it is only the suppletive verb that signals the singular/plural distinction of the object noun gumi ‘cow, cattle’:Elofhai
liongimi.gti.nihai!’6én_kill.SG cattlelionkill.PL cattle‘hin‘The lion killed the cow.’‘The lion killed the cattle.’If SE-!Xun speakers created a fairly complex noun phrase structure, their tense—aspect system remained somewhat underdeveloped, possibly reflecting the situation of Proto-!Xun: other than preverbal clitics *ki (progressive) and *koh (past), there is little in terms of tense—
aspect morphology in SE-!Xun. Compared to that, NW-!Xun developed a range of functional
categories, even if their use remained largely optional.
These are perhaps the major innovations to be observed in !Xun dialects. Otherwise, and in
spite of the many individual changes that occurred in all dialects, as we saw in the preceding
chapters, the typological profile has remained largely the same across dialects.",[166]

"11 Conclusions
We observed in the introductory chapter that we could achieve hardly more in this work than
presenting a skeleton of !Xun grammar, largely restricted to inventory lists and basic gram-matical structures that exhibit some general patterns across dialects. Nevertheless, it is hoped
that we have provided the reader with an outline of the typological profile of the grammar andits dialectal diversity.
11.1 Proto-!XunOur reconstruction work suggests that all modern !Xun dialects can be traced back to one
hypothetically set up ancestor language, Proto-!Xun, presumably spoken in the western and
north-western Kalahari basin between southern Angola and north-eastern Botswana ~ roughly
in the region where relics of them are still found today. Given our limits in dating linguistic
events in the past, it is hard to tell when Proto-!Xun may have existed as a unitary language;
but since their lexical and grammatical diversity is clearly less pronounced than that of, e.g.,
the Romance or Germanic languages, one may speculate that dialect differentiation within
!Xun is the result of processes that took place within the last two millennia.
While the !Xun dialects experienced a number of grammatical transformations in the
course of their history, the overall structure of Proto-!Xun must have been similar to what is
found in the modern dialects. Its consonant structure probably resembled more closely that of
SE-!Xun than NW-!Xun, which lost a number of distinctions due to devoicing (see Snyman
1997 for details). On the other hand, in its click structure it must have differed from both NW-and SE-!Xun in that, in addition to a dental (I), an alveolar (!), a palatal (+), and a lateral (Il)
click type it had a fifth click type, namely the retroflex one (!!). In this respect therefore
Proto-!Xun was probably similar to the moribund Central !Xun, where all five click types are
retained. The retroflex click also survived in the W2 dialect as a phonetic feature but appears
to have been borrowed from Central !Kun, replacing the palatal click.
All evidence available suggests that Proto-!Xun was overwhelmingly an analytic-isolating
language, where verb serialization of the compounding type and clause coordination by
Means of the conjunction *té played a major role in structuring discourse. There was a noun
class system distinguishing four classes and five genders, but the functional yield of this system must have been fairly low: neither reference tracking nor number distinction — two functions widely associated with noun class systems — appear to have been important functions ofthe system.
The main means of expressing number was provided on the one hand by number-sensitive
verbs and nouns and on the other hand by personal pronouns, where in addition to singular
and plural there was a dual category, marked by the pronoun *sa and the number extension
*-tsan, both derived from the numeral *tsan ‘two’. Conceivably,

‘nd that the nouns *ma ‘child, offspring’ (> diminutive), *de ‘mother’ (‘female’), and *kx’ad318The !Xun languagenouns (*dju and *ya), by contrast, spread to all kinds of contexts that we distinguished in section 10.1.
While all these processes concerned the growth of new grammatical forms, there also was
decline, even if it affected only the first person pronouns: in the same way as the new forms
*ma and *na gained in contexts did *mf lose in contexts — with the result that the two now exhibit to some extent mutually exclusive uses. Very likely there is a causal connection between
these processes of gain and loss, but in the absence of any further information we prefer to
leave this issue unresolved. This also applies to the first person exclusive pronoun form *diu
in the N1 dialect, which has completely replaced the old form *é.
In the survey summarized above we tried to describe some properties characterizing the
development of pronouns in terms of the distinction use vs. non-use of pronominal forms in
specific contexts. That this development was not a matter of the past but rather is to be interpreted as an ongoing process is suggested by a quantitative analysis. For example, we saw in
section 10.2 that, as a result of the expansion of the new pronouns *ma and *na in NW-!Xun,
the old form *mi and the new forms show an overlapping behaviour in their use as topical
subject pronouns (TS), both being used interchangeably, except for the N2 dialect, where *mf
is no longer used as a topical subject.
A frequency analysis shows, however, that the situation in these dialects is not everywhere
the same: in W2, *ma is hardly ever used, and most speakers reject it altogether as a topical
subject, using exclusively *mf. In W3 on the other hand, the situation is the other way round:11 Conclusions

While the !Xun dialects experienced a number of grammatical transformations in the
course of their history, the overall structure of Proto-!Xun must have been similar to what is*na is used in 71 % and *mi only in 29 % of our text examples, and much the same holds forfound in the modern dialects. Its consonant structure probably resembled more closely that ofN1, where 72 % of our examples show *ma and only 28 % *mi. These data may give an
indication of the dynamics of the process: W2 is suggestive of the beginning of the process,
where *m is only just beginning to enter the domain of topical subject marking. In W3 and
N1, *ma and *nd, respectively, have become the favoured forms, beginning to oust the old
form *mf, and finally in N2, the process has been concluded in that *ma has totally replacedSE-!Xun than NW-!Xun,*mi.
In this chapter, we provided one example of a diachronic profile of a grammatical domain.
Much the same kind of analysis could have been presented for other domains, but this would
have increased the size of the book to unreasonable length.which lost a number of distinctions due to devoicing (see Snyman1997 for details). On the other hand, in its click structure it must have differed from both NWand SE-!Xun in that, in addition to a dental (I), an alveolar (!), a palatal (+), and a lateral (Il)

productive mechanism.
Overall, Proto-!Xun must have been a language that was unusually context-dependent,
With the exception of the verb, any constituent could be dropped in discourse as long as the
linguistic or extra-linguistic context provided conceptual clues on who did what to whom,
where, when,why, etc. There was, however, a somewhat rigid system of marking relationsamong sentence participants by means of the transitive suffix *-a and the linker *ké/*ko.
11.2 Dialect differentiationThe data presented in the preceding chapters show what must have happened on the way from
a unitary language, the hypothetically set up Proto-!Xun, to the modern dialects. The following is an attempt to point out some of the developments standing out in this process.
There are no indications that — throughout the history that is accessible via linguistic reconstruction — the !Xun-speaking people undertook any dramatic population movements in the
course of their history, or that their language was spoken in areas other than the ones where
they are found today. Dialect differentiation therefore was presumably the result of lack of
continuous linguistic interaction across the large area inhabited by the !Xun people. The splitup into three dialect branches correlates with their present geographical distribution: the geographically most distant branches, NW- and SE-!Xun, exhibit the highest degree of linguistic
differentiation, while Central!Xun, located in the centre, is both lexically and grammaticallyintermediate between these two branches.","[164, 165, 166]"

El29(b) !Xun is a highly context-dependent language, having fairly analytic-isolating morphology.
There is only a small pool of items which have exclusively grammatical function (Heine &
K6nig 2005) or which are not full-fledged phonological words.
(c) The basic word order is head—dependent and subject-verb—object, although there is a mi-a aeexhibiting dependent—head and object-verb word order (see sections 4.2.6, 6.1,(d) It has a non-sex-based gender (or noun class) system distinguishing three, in some dialects
four classes (see section 4.2.1).
(e) It has a serial verb construction (see section 3.6).
(f) There is no ditransitive construction, that is, a verb may take no more than two arguments(see section 3.1.2.3),enone the most frequently used verbs there is a set that is characterized by number sup) Th n (see section 3.1.2.5), and the same applies to nouns (section 4.2.2),

The !Xun-speaking people differ both socio-economically and sociolinguistically from most
other peoples of southwestern Africa. The following general observation applies not only to
the San (“Bushmen”) living in Namibia, but characterizes more specifically the socio-economic situation of virtually all !Xun speakers within and outside Namibia:
The Namibian San are living lives of poverty and dislocation. While different San peoples face different situations, there is a depressing common core to their poverty. It begins
with being landless, often on their own land (Willem Odendaal, The Namibian, October27, 2006).
With few exceptions, all !Xun communities are surrounded by Bantu-speaking societies,
who are not only numerically much stronger but also socially, politically, and economically
dominant. It therefore comes as no surprise that most !Xun speakers of W1 and W2 are fluent
in the Bantu language Kwanyama, those of Kin Kwangari, and those of E3 in Herero, and inmuch of their daily intercourse these !Xun make use of the respective Bantu languages.
Nevertheless, in most of the cases just mentioned there is no indication of language shift:
small children grow up with !Xun as their first and only language, and it is only later in their
childhood that they acquire a second language. In spite of all the social and economic pressure
exerted by the Bantu-speaking communities on the !Xun, the linguistic impact is — perhaps
surprisingly — fairly moderate; the amount of lexical borrowing and grammatical replication
to be found in !Xun is in most communities comparatively small.
Language maintenance is an important discourse in most !Xun communities, not seldom
manifested in a pronounced form of linguistic purism, aimed at keeping foreign words out of
the language. Many a time were we instructed by our !Xun consultants to delete a given word
because it was said to be a loanword and to replace it by a “genuine” !Xun word, although
they themselves were constantly found using the former, and quite some time was spent with
searching for a proper !Xun equivalent. The following case is indicative of the language attitude of many !Xun people that we had the chance to consult: in our discussions with E3
speakers in Gobabis, these speakers tended to eliminate words that they suspected to be loanwords because they found similar form-meaning pairings in other languages they were familiar with. For this reason they asked us to eliminate the verb Aij ‘help’, arguing that this is a
Khoekhoe (Nama) word; as a matter of fact, however, Ail? is a Proto-!Xun stem (*hii ‘help’)
to be found in virtually all dialects Angola, Namibia, and Botswana (cf. table 1-5).
There is little communication across and knowledge about fellow !Xun communities. Even
neighbouring !Xun communities are frequently ignorant of each other’s linguistic and other
whereabouts. Hasselbring (1999: 78) reports that E3 (#Kx’au-ll’ein) speakers said that it took
them a few months before they could understand the neighbouring El dialect of Tsumkwe
(Jul’hoan), that it would be difficult for them to learn to read and write E1 and that they would
rather learn to read and write in their own “language”, or in the Central Khoisan language
Naro since they are more familiar with the latter. Note that — as the classification in table 1-2
shows — E3 and E1 are very closely related, neighbouring dialects.","[15, 16]"
"Another example is provided by the growth of reflexive categories. Cross-linguistically
one of the most common ways in which new reflexive forms arise is via the grammaticalization of a noun for ‘body’, and this is what appears to have happened in Proto-!Xun, as we saw
above. But instead of a noun for ‘body’ it may be some specific body part, most of all the‘head’ that is recruited for this purpose. And in fact, there is at least one dialect, W2, which
has grammaticalized its noun for ‘head’, ’n/é, to a reflexive marker — with the effect that thi
dialect has now two reflexive markers, one (/é) inherited from Proto-!Xun (< *|’ae) and an-Conclusions323also suggest, this process did not only take place in earlier stages of language development
put also more recently in the course of development of individual dialects.
But there are also many new forms of grammar that cannot be traced back to earlier phasesin the development of the language but rather are recent creations in specific dialects. Thepreceding chapters offered a wide range of examples; suffice it to mention one case that was
discussed in section 3.2. Cross-linguistically, among the most frequent sources for future
tenses there are motion verbs for ‘go to’ or ‘come to’, English be going to being an instance
of the process concerned. Such a process also took place in all documented Xun dialects in
some form or other. Nevertheless, there is no indication to assume that there is one single
earlier source that can be held responsible for this situation. Rather, it would seem that eachdialect created its own future tense, using either the verb *ti ‘go’ or *glé ‘come’, sometimes in
combination with the transitive suffix *-a, sometimes without it. It is only the closely related
dialects W1 and W2 that presumably have a shared innovation: the future proclitic 6a found
in these two dialects very likely arose prior
_ to the split3 of these dialects as a result of agrammaticalization process *t-a ‘go to’ > oa future tense.
a
.
To conclude, the !Xun language has undergone a wide range of changes in its dialect his:
tory. Most of the new functional categories that arose, however, are not fully grammatic ized, having retained many structural properties of their lexical or other less gammasources. The result is that many of these categories can simultaneously be interpreted wi
teference both to their non-grammaticalized and their grammaticalized status. We may cite
the example of the item *1i!f that we discussed above (see also section 5.2.1): being the onlyother (’n/2) created after W2 evolved as a distinct dialect. And in the E2 dialect, another bodpostposition (“in, at’) in a number of dialects, it can at the same timebe described as well as aized reflexive construction (see section 4.1.4).
Further examples of where a strategy employed to create new grammatical formsfialization, such as the item *llx’4é: being diachronically a lexical verb meaning ‘meet, gather’, it was grammaticalized in a number of dialects to a marker with a cooperative functionpart, /x’a ‘heart’, provided the conceptual basis for creating a second, weakly grammatical-made use of in the earliest stages of language development and was later on used again, are
not hard to come by. As the data discussed in section 6.2.2 suggest, a process leading from a
verb ‘make’ or ‘cause’ to a functional category of causative (*n#u, *n+4f) must be old in thelanguage. But the same process apparently took place once again after the first split of the Janguage, where speakers of NW-!Xun drew on their verb *6 and speakers of SE-!Xun on theif
verb *di, both meaning ‘do’, to acquire a second causative prefix or proclitic — with the resultthat in both dialect clusters there are now two competing causative derivations.jA second example relates to comparative constructions, more precisely to the comparativeof inequality (e.g., John is taller than Debbie). Clearly the major source for such constrtions in African languages is provided by the action schema using verbs such as ‘defeat’, ‘surpass’, or ‘pass’ to present the standard of comparison (e.g., John is tall surpasses DebbieHeine 1997b). We argued in section 7.3.2 that such a construction must have existed in Pro ""4!Xun, where the verb *#aun ‘surpass’ was grammaticalized to a comparative marker. But
similar processes also took place in the dialects, where verbs meaning ‘surpass’ or “pass 88%
rise to weakly grammaticalized constructions of comparison of inequality.
‘
A third example concerns clause subordination. The grammaticalization of demonstra’
pronouns to subordinating conjunctions is a ubiquitous process in the languages of the wo
English that being a case in point (see Heine & Kuteva 2002). As the data presented in 4 4
ter 9 suggest, this process must have shaped the structure of clause subordination of !X
from its earliest stages on: it was most of all demonstrative pronouns composed of the ee
class marker *ka (class 4), either on its own or combined with the proximal demonstra
stems *é and *i ‘this, here’ (hence *ka & and *ka 9) that provided the source for a rane
subordinators in all main domains of clause embedding, be that complement clauses (sect9.2.1), relative clauses (section 9.2.2), or adverbial clauses (section 9.2.3). And as these ©noun for ‘inside’. And much the same applies to many other categories that arose via verb se-(together’) when used as the second verb in a sequence of two verbs, thus being at the hn
ime a lexical and a functional category. All dialects offer a plethora of grammatical hybrids”, as they are called in Heine & Kénig (2005) — a typological characteristic of many
analytic-isolating languages.oo,hAt the same time, there are also a number of cases of completed grammaticalization, wherealexical or other source item has been lost and the functional category is the only one sonying. Thus, the noun *l’ae ‘body’ has disappeared from the language except for a few re I in.the E2 dialect (Kohler 1973, 1981) and *l’ae is now exclusively a teflexive marker in ala-tects, The noun *de ‘mother’ has survived only in the Angolan vanieties Nl and NeoeWhere it is accessible only as a derivational suffix (‘female’; section 6.2.2) or in lexicaliza-Hons, cf. N1 da’ba-dé-ma or W2 daba-dé-ma (child-female-DIM) ‘girl’.
11.4 !Xun as a written languageWe observed in chapter 1 that !Xun can be defined as a complex language whose dialects are
Presumably linked by a chain of mutual intelligibility. This raises the question of whether it is
feasible to devise a written standard form that would be acceptable to the entire !Xun commu-Qity,AS we Saw in section 1.3, there is an optional rule in !Xun whereby [u] changes to [o] preceding [a].",[167]

Many nouns are what Kahler (1973: 26) calls “bivalent” in E2, that is, they have both nomand verbal uses. This appears to be due to the presence of a fairly productive conversionpattern whereby verbs can function as nouns without involving any formal means, e.g.,(a) ‘eat’, (b) ‘food’nd‘For food he came.’The sequence g/é /a’a is suggestive of the SVC in that there appears to be a canonical combination of two verbs, g/é ‘come’ and /a’a ‘give’.

the basis of the meaning of the utterance, which suggests that g/é is the main verb; according

this example suggests that it is not a coverb but a derivational extension since /a’a as an

"322The !Xun languapBut it was not only lexical and functional forms that bear witness to the dynamics of evoly
tion within the !Xun language; there were syntactic patterns as well. We saw in section 7.2
that it was the syntax of attributive possession (e.g. ‘the eating of meat’) that was exploited to
create a complement clause syntax with the object preceding the verb (‘I want meat eating’ >
‘I want to eat meat’). This process of syntactic reinterpretation, which can also be traced backto Proto-!Xun, was restricted to a limited set of matrix verbs, such as verbs of modality, volition, cognition, etc.
Other processes leading to the emergence of new patterns of grammar must have sta
out in Proto-!Xun but underwent further developments in the dialects. For example, the motion verbs *tu’a and *ti ‘go’ in combination with a noun class marker must have grammatical
ized to distal demonstratives and adverbs already in Proto-!Xun, as their distribution across
dialects suggests (see section 4.2.3), but this was not the end of the process: most dialects developed new locative adverbs by grammaticalizing motion verbs, such as W1 /’an ‘be farther.off, arrive’ or El g&é ‘come, arrive’, tsf ‘come’, !’an ‘go up’, etc. (see section 4.2.3.1).","[166, 167]"

‘I cover the bird with ashes.’ (Bleek 1956: 243)mawe follow Dixon (1994) and others in using it as a semantic-syntactic primitive determined by
verbal valence: participants of the clause that are required by the verb are called arguments,
all other participants being adjuncts.
Crucial for the framework used by Malchukov et al. (2007) is the distinction between the
semantic roles recipient (R) and theme (T), which cross-linguistically exhibit a differential behaviour, Our work on !Xun grammar suggests, however, that in this language the two behave
Structurally the same, that is, both can be either arguments or adjuncts and, accordingly, both
can occur unmarked for participant status or marked as adjuncts by means of either the transi-2008 for more details).",[29]

Reconstruction is however not a central goal of our analysis; rather, we are using these forms primarily as a convenient tool for referring to sets of identical or closely related forms across dialects. Nevertheless, reconstruction work is based on principles of historical linguistics (see section 1.3) and can be taken to present viable hypotheses on earlier states
of the !Xun language; a systematic reconstruction of the language, however, still needs to be
done (see chapter 10 and 11).
One main goal of this work is to offer a dialect analysis of the grammar of !Xun, especially
since for most dialects there is so far no grammatical information. The fact that we will be
dealing with eleven different dialects and that the book is divided into eleven chapters is no
more than a coincidence. The approach we are using is comparative rather than monographic
in nature, but the data are presented in such a way that the reader interested in one particular
dialect will have no problem in finding the relevant information for this dialect. It goes withOut saying that the dialects for which there is more detailed information are better represented,
but wherever possible we decided to give precedence to little-known dialects and unpublished
material in the examples presented. Roughly half of the materials to be presented stems from
published sources. Whenever no bibliographical references are given, the relevant data are
aa an our own field work collection, which accounts for the other half of the materialsiscussed.",[18]
