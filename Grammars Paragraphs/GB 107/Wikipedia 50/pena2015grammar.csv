17.5.2.3. The marking of negation in verbal predicates
Negation is also marked di$erently for the copula a, the copula clitics and the
existential a. First, depending on the intending message and speci""c morphosyntactic
environment, a negative clause with the copula a can be marked in two ways: a) the
negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau marks the copula complement (42), or, b) the negative verbal
morpheme -t͡ʃa is attached to the copula itself254 (43).

On the other hand, unlike the copula verb a, copula clitics do not receive the254. The su#x -t͡ʃa is a non-present negative marker. For present tense, the su#x -tsu is used.","[786, 787]"

simply coined by addition of the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau (as explained in §9.5.2); e.g.
kuitari ̃tinu ‘rich’ vs. kuitari ̃-t͡ʃau ‘poor’;247 pɨnkɨra ‘good’ vs pɨnkɨra-t͡ʃau ‘bad’.
In any case, the main strategy of negation in juxtaposition constructions is the use of
the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau with the nominal or adjectival predicate. Thus, the
negative construction of juxtaposing predicates is [NP NP/AdjP-NEG], as examples (9)–
(10) show.

As Table 14.8 indicates, S arguments (the sole argument of an intransitive verb)
are always marked in position 7 of the verb. The following examples illustrate S
arguments (1, 2 and 3 persons) marked on the verb.

The following examples illustrate the transitive indexation patterns presented in
Table 14.8. In transitive clauses, the su#xes listed previously in Table 14.5 are used
when a 1A or 2A argument acts upon a 3 person object as in (34)–(35), and when a 2A
argument acts upon a 1 person object (36). Once again, remember that when a 1A
argument acts upon a 2P argument, there is a portmanteau su#x that refers to both
arguments of the transitive clause (37)–(38).

‘I am telling you (PL).’
From the examples above, it can be said that coding in the local domain (SAP →
SAP) depends on which grammatical person is the A argument: if A is a 1 person, thenboth A and P are marked in position 7; wheras if A is 2 person, then only A is marked in
that position (and P is marked in position 2). This suggests a hierarchy 2 > 1, as it
seems that a 2P argument needs to be marked also in position 7. In the direct domain
(SAP → 3), only the A argument is marked in the “subject” position. Now, let us
consider the “inverse” domain (3 → SAP).

From the above examples, it can be seen that Plural SAP take preeminence over
a 3 person, as they access position 7.
To summarize, there are two morphological positions for indexing core
arguments on the verb, SAP always access Position 2 (“Object”), SAP and 3 can access
Position 7 as A, but as P arguments only Plural SAP can access position 7. Position 7
shows an interesting mismatch with regards to argument indexation: it is consistent in
the forms for person, but not for role.
Position 2Position 71SG P3A2SG P3A1PL P1PL P (A form)2PL P2PL P (A form)
Overall, the hierarchy on which access to Position 7 depends as index of P canbe summarized as: 2PL > 2SG > 1PL > 1SG/3. That is, 2 person outranks 1PL, and
1SG/3 are low in the hierarchy.
The hierarchy on which access to Position 2 depends as index of P can be
summarized as: 1PL/1SG > 2SG/2PL > 3. That is, in for position 2, 1 person outranks
6692 person, and SAP person outrank 3 person.
14.4. Mood
For purposes of this grammar, I use the term Mood for the grammatical category
that encodes modality. Modality signals a speaker’s attitude toward a proposition,
including the speaker’s belief in its reality, likelihood or relevance to her/himself
(Bybee 1985; Timberlake 2007). In Wampis, the categories encoded under the label
‘Mood’ in this section are marked in the ""nite verb, never in a subordinated verb. The
Mood categories occupy di$erent positions in the verb structure:
MoodPositionDesiderative, Imperative, Jussive,Position 6Apprehensive, Hortative
Declarative, ExclamativePosition 8NarrativeMarked with timaji14.4.1. Declarative
The declarative signals that the proposition expressed by a speaker’s utterance is
o$ered as an unquali""ed statement of a fact. The declarative is marked with -i.

14.4.2. Exclamative
The exclamative is zero-marked. Exclamatory sentences are frequently
accompanied by an intonational raise.

urutumauunta=aitawhatbig=COP.3.EXCLAM‘It is big!’
An interesting property of exclamative (and also interrogative) sentences in
Wampis is the addition of a negative morpheme that emphasizes the idea of the
predication, rather than negates it:

prohibitive
Commands prototypically involve manipulation of other individuals. Imperatives
necessarily take aktionsart stems; other stem types are incompatible with the imperative
mood. The jussive, hortative and prohibitive are closely associated. The prohibitive is
the negative counterpart of the imperative, whereas the jussive and the hortative
express manipulative action towards di$erent persons (third person and ""rst person
plural, respectively). The following subsections describe these su#xes.
14.4.3.1. Imperative
The imperative -tá addresses a second person singular by default and, in terms of
polarity, is always a positive command (for negative commands, the prohibitive -pa is
used (see §14.4.3.5). A 2 plural addressee is marked with the 2 plural subject su#x rumɨ. The imperative is likely related to the the future marker -ta. Table 14.9
summarizes the imperative constructions with singular and plural forms.","[704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712]"

Other lexical types of verbs
12.5.1. Lexically negative verbs
Some verbs in Wampis are lexically inherently negative, i.e. they do not538necessitate any negative morpheme in order to change their polarity. Examples of this
are tuhina ‘be unable, have di#culty’, nakita ‘not want’203 and kaninma204 ‘not ""t (in a
space)’.
12.5.2. Verbs that lexicalize a speci!c type of patient or location
The lexical content of Wampis verb roots can have very rich/speci""c content
and provide inherent information about the object or location that need not be
mentioned—of course, many of these meanings are culturally-speci""c. Some verbs also
include manner information in their lexical representation. To give a sense of what can
be found in the Wampis lexicon (at the level of the root) here is a short list of verb roots
that are di#cult to gloss with one or two words:
(8)
aɨpa‘leave/put on /oor or bed’apa‘put a bite in mouth (also applies to putting bites of manioc during the process
of preparing manioc beer)’apuha ‘put on ""nger’
at͡sɨnu ‘put on a garment for the head’203. The source of this verb is probably the adjective naki ‘lazy’. The portion -ta may be a
variant of an old verbalizer -tu.
204. The underlying form of this verb likely is kaninVma, as the third vowel would be always
dropped due to the vowel elision process explained in Chapter VI. Thus the root would be kaninV
plus the re/exive -ma. Synchronically, I have not found an etymon for the (apparent) root
kaninV.","[578, 579]"

Negation
There are two negative su#xes on the verb in Wampis: -t͡ʃa and -t͡su. They are in
complementary distribution:
a) -t͡su occurs in the following morphosyntactically conditioned contexts:• with the imperfective stem
• with the existential verb a (§17.5)
b) -t͡ʃa occurs everywhere else, including with the copular verb a (homophonous but
analyzed as morphosyntactically distinct from the existential verb a, (§17.5.2.3).
The examples below illustrate the di$erent contexts where the negative -t͡su
637occurs. Examples (114)–(115) are instances of -t͡su with the imperfective228 and with the
existential (116).

"747verbal negative su#x -t͡ʃa. Instead, negation is marked in the clause by attaching the
negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau to the nominal or adjectival complement. The copula clitics
function basically as verbalizers, and thus follow the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau.

Finally, the existential receives the negative su#x -t͡su, which is only used in
present tense (see §13.4 for details), as the following examples illustrate.
(46) nihʲamãnt͡ʃ at͡sáwɛi

Importantly, the existential verb a never receives the non-present negative
marker -t͡ʃa. Thus, if the temporal reference is not present declarative, the existential748still occurs with -t͡su but the non-present tense reference (in the example, a remote past)
is conveyed by using a copula auxiliary, as non-present tenses are incompatible with t͡su. Example (48) illustrate a construction with an existential negated with -t͡su followed
by a copula in auxiliary function, marked for past tense.

17.5.2.4. Copular and existential predicates in subordinate clauses
The copula a can be subordinated with the subordinating morpheme -sa ‘Nontemporal manner’. The occurrence of a-sa (copula+subordinator) is frequent in texts
and conversations. This structure is often used to establish meanings related to ‘reason’
or ‘cause’:
(49) nítʲaʃa arát͡ʃou ásar kukút͡ʃ ɛ́iɲant͡ʃa aʃí sumɛ́iɲa asámtɛɛ̃ wíʃa surúktahɛɛ

who did not grow theirs).
In the data gathered for this research project, copula clitics do not occur at all in
subordinating constructions (they only occur in the main clause). Thus, a potential
subordinated clause as in (50) is not possible as far as I can tell; instead, only the
subordinated verb occurs (51):
(50)

‘being bad (people) […]’
In contrast, the existential verb a can occur within subordinate clauses, although
in my data the existential itself never carries -sa. Example (52) shows the existential in
a subordinate clause (second line in the analysis); notice however that it is the copula
verb (not the existential) which carries the subordinating morpheme.

Subordination in Wampis is described in detailed in Chapter XIX.
17.5.3. Functions of the copula a, copula clitics and the existential a
The copula a and the copula clitics are all used for proper inclusion, equative
and attributive predications. The main di$erences between the copula a and the copula
clitics are not semantic, as evidenced from the previous discussion, but
morphosyntactic. The existential is used to express locative predications, and to express
possession.
17.5.3.1. The copula a
The copula a is used in predicate nominal and predicate adjective constructions
to encode proper inclusion, equative and attributive functions. Wampis does not
751distinguish structurally between inclusion and equation, and the only structural
di$erence of these with attribution is that in attributive clauses an AdjP can occur in
the predicate. The basic construction with the copula is:
NP X COP
In the above construction, NP is the subject of the copula. A full NP, a pronoun,
a determiner or a nominalized verb can occur as the copula subject. In addition, X
above stands for the complement of the copula. X can be a NP, a nominalized verb or an
AdjP. I have no examples of a pronoun or a determiner occupying the position of X.
Sentences (53)–(54) constitute examples of proper inclusion and equative clauses with
the copula. Sentence (53) has a nominalized verb as the complement of the copula. In
(54), the copula complement is a noun (in this case the proper name Miik).

The next examples illustrate attributive clauses with the copula, where the752complements are ‘lazi’ and ‘short’, respectively.

17.5.3.2. The copula clitics
The copula clitics have allomorphs as summarized in Table 17.2, see §5.6.5 for a
detailed explanation of morphophonological processes that condition the form of these
allomorphs.","[787, 788, 789, 790, 791, 792, 793]"
"2. The term <Chicham> (/t͡ʃit͡ʃama/) ‘word, language’ has been proposed as the name of the
family instead of Jivaroan (Katan Jua 2011). The term <Jivaro> or <Jibaro> has negative
connotations in some varieties of Spanish where it became almost synonym of ‘savage’. The term
<Jivaro> might sound insulting to the Shuar of Ecuador but, as far as I can tell, it does not
have the same strong negative sense for the Wampis.
3. Throughout this dissertation I use the o#cial names of Jivaroan languages as used by the
native speakers for their languages and as they appear in o#cial documents of Peru and
Ecuador. The names in parenthesis correspond to the imposed Spanish spelling of their names,
which has been followed by other scholars who write in other languages, such as English or
French—those same spellings have been used more frequently in the literature about the
Jivaroan peoples and languages. For a list of o#cial names of native languages of Peru, one can
consult http://bdpi.cultura.gob.pe/lista-de-pueblos-indigenas; and for Ecuador, see http:/

Recall that, phonologically, sequences of the type Cau (C=consonant) can
undergo internal vowel elision if the vowel is in a position to be deleted, a seen in
Chapter VI. Consequently, when the underlying /a/ is elided from -nau, the morpheme
surfaces as [nu], as in (22) where it is the third vowel from the left. One can speculate
that, historically, -nau could be morphologically complex: it may be composed of an old
form *na (perhaps related to the accusative =na?)187 and the Set II nominalizer -u (cf.
§15.4.5). As we saw in Chapter VI (see also §10.4.5 below), the nominalizer -u triggers
vowel-internal elision in Cau sequences. One di#culty with this hypothesis is that -u
derives deverbal nouns elsewhere in the grammar, and is not otherwise attested in
noun-to-noun derivation.
10.4.5. Negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau
The negative -t͡ʃau is historically composed of the verbal negative morpheme -t͡ʃa
and the Set II nominalizer -u (§15.4.5). As the name indicates, -t͡ʃau negates or inverts187. Notice that Wampis does not distinguish morphologically between direct/indirect object.
Both Objects in ditransitive constructions are marked with the accusative =na. There
conceivably could be a connection between the use of =na to mark benefactive/recipient
referents in ditransitive constructions and the benefactive/recipient function of -nau.","[519, 520]"

An interesting note regarding the order of morphemes in interrogative clauses is
that the question marker =ka comes before the copula clitic, hinting at a more recent754grammaticalization of the clitics:
(60) warí tumɛ́int͡sukɛit?
uari ̃ tu-mai-inu-t͡su=ka=aita
what say-POT-NMLZ-INFER-Q=COP
‘How can it be said?
The next example illustrates the use of the copula clitics in exclamative setinclusion clauses. Notice that the question marker =ka can optionally occur in
exclamative sentences and may be being reanalyzed as a non-declarative marker. If the
question marker =ka occurs, the order of the morphemes is the same as in
interrogatives, i.e. the question marker precedes the copula clitic. Note that the negative
is used in this case to emphasize the idea of surprise of the expression, not in its literal
‘negation’ meaning.
(61) auʃa ɲawánt͡ʃukɛit!
au=ʃa
iauã-́ t͡ʃau=ka=aita
DIST=ADDdog-NEG.NMLZ=Q=COP.EXCL‘That is a jaguar!’
The sentence in (62) below contains an example of the use of the preterite
copula clitic. I only have a handful of occurrences of this morpheme in my data, and it
is apparently not very productive. For comparison, a question in present tense is also
presented in (63). In the data for Wampis, the copula can refer to the remote or recent
past. Notice that Overall (2007) reports a cognate remote past copula su#x -ya in755Awajun.
(62) jája óuʃa
ia=iaau=ʃawho=COP.PTDIST=ADD‘Who was that?’(63) jɛ́it óuʃa
ia=itaau=ʃawho=COPDIST=ADD‘Who is that?’
In addition, I was told by one of my teachers that a sentence like (64), which
was pronounced with the clitic, should be transcribed as presented in (65); i.e.
""corrected"" with a fully conjugated copula verb. It is possible thus that the copula clitic
=ia comes from the homophonous remote past tense marker -ia that is present in (65).
The latter might have been reanalyzed after the remote past stem a-ia (Copula-Remote
Past) was phonetically reduced.

The existential construction in Wampis, as is to be expected, is based on the
existential verb a. A location can (and usually) occur(s). The basic existential
construction is:
NP (LOC) Exist
The LOC is typically either an NP, a locational word or an adverb and it is
always marked with a locative marker. The NP subject is always nominative. The next
examples illustrate the use of existential clauses.
(66) ampúʃ numíɲam ájawɛɛ
ampuʃanumi=namaaia-ua-iowltree=LOCexist.PL-ua-i‘There are owls in the tree.’(67) namák junkúnamu áwɛi

naɨka apiha-mau
ropepininka=numafold.pfv-NMLZ bowl.type=LOCa-ua-i
exist-3.SBJ-DECL‘There is a folded rope in the bowl.’757Recall that the existential verb a has no TAM restrictions attested in the data.
Morphologically, the existential verb is characterized by having a plural suppletive
allomorph aia, and by receiving the negative marker -t͡su, as explained previously in
§17.5.2.
17.5.3.3.1. Possession with existential a + applicative
The existential verb a may be su#xed with an applicative to create a possessive
stem; the possessive function might have originated in a benefactive use of the
applicative. Unlike the original existential verb a, the possessive stem with the
applicative is structurally transitive. In this possessive construction, the possessed thing
appears as the subject of the verb and the possessor as the object. The possessor is
indexed as an object on the verb if the possessor is a Speech Act Participant (SAP) as in
(69); third persons do not have an overt verbal object marker and thus are left
unmarked (70). Note that the possessed thing (the grammatical subject in the
construction) can occur without being marked as possessed, as in (71), but semantically
it is understood as possessed (hence the reason why this construction is considered as a
possession construction). The possessor can occur in an overt NP marked with the
accusative (71)—but two overt NP arguments of the verb are very rare in natural758speech, an overt NP possessor is rare.

The marking of Plural SAP’s possessor (the grammatical objects) on the verb
show a di$erent (and uncommon) pattern, as Wampis argument indexation is
morphologically and semantically complex (see §14.3.3 for details). For 1 and 2 plural
possessors, the markings on the verb vary: the possessed thing no longer formally occurs
as the subject of the verb. Instead both the object and subject markers, both referring
to the possessor, occur at the same time. Thus, no indication of the possessed thing
(a third person subject) overtly appears as the subject on the verb, as happens for the
other grammatical persons/numbers. Notice, however, that this is actually the way759Wampis marks the situation of a 3 person subject acting on a 1 or 2 plural object (i.e.
the 3 → PL.SAP scenario): the 1 or 2 plural argument is marked in both the object and
subject verb slots. Examples (72) and (73) illustrate this pattern for 1pl and 2pl
possessor:

17.5.3.3.2. Predicate locatives
Locative constructions typically involve a construal in which a Figure (an NP
that is being identi""ed) is located on a Ground (an NP that constitutes the referential
location of the Figure) (Langacker 1987; Levinson & Wilkins 2006; Talmy 2007). Many
languages employ copulas or existential verbs for the expression of spatial relations.
Other employ posture verbs or positional verbs. For Wampis, the results of a study
about the expression of spatial relations that I carried out were presented at the 2015
Society for the Study of Indigenous Languages of the Americas Annual Meeting (Peña7602015). Because of time and space constraints, only a summary is presented here.
Of the types of spatial relations as de""ned in Ameka & Levinson (2007), Wampis
actually employs most of them. Therefore, it is better to speak of di$erent strategies or
constructions for Wampis, rather than trying to ""t a strict typological parameters255
(Grinevald 2006).
The copulas and the existential can be used in predications that express spatial
notions, but a locative postposition must occur on the predicate NP, as can be observed
in (74)–(75).

nunanki mesa=nama aia-ua-ithatspear table=LOCexist.PL-3-DECL'There are spears on the table.'
Using the copula and the existential are by no means the only strategy that
Wampis uses for locational predicates. Wampis possesses a fairly sophisticated lexical
pool of verbs that are used in locatives constructions (especially for the subdomain of255. Grinevald (2006), working on a varied sample of Amerindian languages, has proposed
“intermediate” systems that allow for continuos, non-discrete, categories.","[793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798, 799, 800, 801]"

without being able to move her lips very much. To transmit the way the character of

side of her mouth’ (‘de costadito’ in the Spanish translation provided by my teachers).

7.8. Compounds
A compound word is a word that is formed by two di$erent words. The criteria
for determining compound words can be semantic or formal (Payne 1997: 92).
Formally, in Wampis compound words, both elements retained a high tone and are
susceptible to the vowel elision processes seen in Chapter VI. However, when they
receive in/ection, the in/ection only attaches to the second element, showing that they
constitute a single unit. For instance, normally the accusative =na appears on all
elements of a noun phrase when a determiner is present:
(32) núna sɨ ́nt͡ʃin ʃuarán
nu=nasɨnt͡ʃi=naʃuara=naNON.VIS=ACCstrong=ACCperson=ACC‘to that strong person’
However, in a compound word, like hapa_iauaã ‘puma’ (hapa ‘deer’ + iauaã325‘dog’), in a similar morphosyntactic environment, the accusative attaches to the second
root of the compound (iawaã) only, not to each element as in (32). Thus, hapa_iauaã is
treated as a single word, as shown in the next example.
(33) núna hapá ɲawáan
̃
nu=nahapa_iauaã=naNON.VIS=ACCpuma=ACC‘to that puma’In addition, compare (33) with (34) below, where the word tura ‘and,’ is added.
In (34), hapa ‘deer’ and iawã ‘dog’ appear as distinct words and therefore each of them
receives the accusative =na. Notice that it is impossible for that phrase to have the
reading ‘and to the puma’.
(34) núna hapán túra ɲãwãán
nu=nahapa=naturaiawã=naNON.VIS=ACCdeer=ACCanddog=ACC‘to the deer and the dog’
Syntactically, compound words always show a [Modi""er-Head] structure,
whereas adjectives in noun phrases can come before or after their noun head (the latter
is the most frequent order). Place names uniformly show a [Modi""er-Head] structure,
though in many cases the roots are phonetically reduced:
(35) t͡ʃinkanás<t͡ʃinkana+ɨntsa
bamboo.sp+river‘River of bamboo’ (for the community named t͡ʃinkanás, Spanish <Chinganaza>)
326Semantically, a compound word’s meaning is more particular or even completely
di$erent (i.e. unpredictable) from the sum of its parts. The next examples illustrate this
point for Wampis.
(36) hapá ɲawáã
hapa_iauaã
deer_dog
‘puma’(37) uún ɲawáã
uunta_iawã
big_dog
‘jaguar’(38) wákɨ mɨsɨ ́r
wakɨ_mɨsɨr
stomach_ruin
‘sad’
In Wampis, compounds can be created by the following combinations:
Noun+Noun (as in example (36) above), Adjective+Noun (as in (37)), and more rarely
Noun+Verb (as in (38)). There are also examples of the intensi""er ima+Noun:
(39) imʲá nápi
ima_napi
INTS_snake‘venomous snake sp.’3277.9. Particles
A particle is generally understood as an invariant element (i.e. it does not
receive in/ection) that is phonologically independent. In this dissertation, I will not
refer to particles as a di$erent word class on their own. Rather, I use the terms
Interjection, Ideophone and Grammatical Particle to refer to elements that can be seen
as having the properties of being phonologically independent and being invariant.
These three categories constitute di$erent classes in the present analysis. Very brie/y:
Interjections are words that constitute complete utterances by themselves (they are
described in §8.11). Ideophones are words that evoke an idea in sound and function
mostly adverbially in Wampis but can replace predicates (they are described in §8.12).
Grammatical particle is a more restricted term: a grammatical particle is an invariant
element that provides some grammatical information (e.g. aspect) to the clause. There
are only two grammatical particles in Wampis, has and hak (see §8.13).","[364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"
"729The predicate constituent can be either an AdjP or another NP.
Secondly, non-verbal predicates in Wampis may occur with a copula a or copula
clitics =aita~=ita (for speech act participants) and =aiti~=iti (for third person)
which can be translated as ‘be’. It will be seen that the distinctions in the distribution of
the copula verb a and the copula clitics are based on TAM restrictions and on whether
the clause is subordinated or not (copula clitics never occur in subordinated clauses). In
addition, Wampis distinguishes the copula a from an existential verb a. Both verbs are
homophonous but morphosyntactically distinct (see §17.5.1).
Thirdly, there are full lexical verbs that have been grammaticalized to assume
copular functions. These verbs are used in existential/locative predicates; the most
frequently used in this function are puhu ‘live’, iruna ‘crowd together, pile up, be
dispersed’, and mat͡satu ‘live together’. Other full lexical verbs that are used in locative
constructions are posture verbs such as tɨpɨ ‘lie down’ and uaha ‘stand’.
Other verbs that are structurally used in copular constructions can be
characterized as what have been termed semi-copulas (Hengeveld 1992). Wampis does
not have a dedicated verb whose original lexical meaning is ‘become’. Instead, it uses
full lexical verbs nahana ‘make’ and uɨ ‘go’, which in copular constructions assume the730meaning of ‘become’.
17.4. Non-verbal clauses
17.4.1. Juxtaposition constructions: equative, proper inclusion, attributive
In general, a juxtaposition construction consists of a sequence of two elements
without any relational or copular element between the two (a zero copula strategy). In
Wampis, an NP and NP/AdjP can be juxtaposed to form a verbless clause. In the data
used for this study, the ""rst NP is always the subject and the second NP/AdjP is always
the predicate. If the second constituent is an NP, it can be headed by a simple noun or a
nominalized verb, or it can be marked with the attributive -tinu (see below).
Juxtaposition constructions are used for equative (or identi""cation), proper inclusion
and attributive predications.
The following examples constitute instances of equative constructions. The NP
subject can be a full NP (1), a demonstrative (2) or a pronoun (3):
(1) núu úun míɲa papár
[nuúunta] [mina papa-ru]NON.VIS elder1SG.GEN father-1SG.POSS‘That elder is my father.’
́ ̃ míɲa kumpár
(2) hũu

PROXkumpa-ru]1SG.GEN friend-1SG.POSS‘This is my friend.’
731(3) níŋkʲa míɲa kumpár
[ni ̃=ka][mi-na kumpa-ru]3SG=FOC1SG.GEN friend-1SG.POSS‘He is my friend.’The following examples constitutes instances of proper inclusion using
juxtaposition of NPs. In (4), the predicate of the clause is a nominalization. In this
example, a speci""c entity (Nantu ‘Moon’) is being predicated to belong to a class (i.e.
‘hunter’). In (5), the subject identi""es himself as belonging to a class designated by the
noun Wampisa.
(4) Nántuka ɨákmou
[Nantu=ka[ɨakama-u]Moon=FOClook.for.game-NMLZ‘Nantu [was] a killer of animals.’ (i.e. ‘Moon hunted animals’)(5) wíkʲa ʃuár wampís
[ui=ka][ʃuara wampisa]1SG=FOCperson Wampis‘I [am] a Wampis person.’Attributive constructions can have an AdjP or an NP (including nominalizations)
as their predicate. Examples (6) and (7) show a juxtaposition where the predicate is an
AdjP, whereas (8) shows a juxtaposition structure where an NP constitutes the predicate732of the clause.
(6) Kanús saár

[nuúunta] [umi-inu]NON.VIS elder""nish-nmlz‘That elder [is] reliable.’ (Lit: ‘That elder [is] someone who ""nishes his job/duty’)
17.4.2. Negation in juxtaposition constructions
It is possible to negate juxtaposition constructions. However, there is a
preference among Wampis speakers to use the copula a or copula clitics (depending on
the morphosyntactic environment as described below) in negative clauses. It is more
common to ""nd negative juxtaposition constructions in attributive function than in
equative and proper inclusion functions. This is probably due to the nature of a good246. Native people of the forest who appear in folktales. The Wampis considered them to be uncontacted people who actually exist. The Wampis tell stories about seeing them while hunting or
traveling in the forest.","[769, 770, 771, 772, 773]"
"691Unlike what I de""ne as subordinate verbs, a nominalized verb never receives a switchreference marker or person subject markers, and can function as syntactic arguments of
predicates (i.e. nominalizations receive case marking).
With this background on the nominalizable stem and the nominalized verb, we
now turn to the discussion of the nominalizers themselves in Wampis.
15.3. Nominalizers in Wampis
There are two sets of nominalizers in Wampis, which I call Set I and Set II. Both
sets are used for lexical and grammatical nominalizations. Lexical nominalization
“creates new lexical items belonging to the noun class of the language”, whereas
grammatical nominalization “creates new referring expressions that have no lexical
status” (Shibatani 2009: 187).237 There are two more nominalizers, the negative
nominalizer -t͡ʃau (§10.4.5), and the nominalizer -na, which is not lexically productive
and is mainly used in relative clauses and with the potential stem (§15.4.8). Set I and
Set II nominalizers are presented in Table 15.2.","[731, 732]"
"• In contrast, the copula clitics are used in present tense declarative, in content and
polarity questions, and exclamative clauses. The exception to this copula clitic
restriction is one copula clitic that is used in past tense: =ia.",[780]
"Morphologically, Set I and Set II di$er in one important property: with the
exception of the future nominalizer -tinu, Set I nominalizing su#xes can occur on bare
roots, but they do not attach to an aspectualized verb stem. In contrast, Set II
morphemes can be attached to an aspectualized stem, as de""ned in §15.2. In addition,
the Set II subject nominalizer -u, and Set I future nominalizer -tinu and patient/location
694nominalizer -tai ̃ can combine with the verbal negative su#x -tʃa. The distributional
properties of Set I and Set II nominalizers are listed in Table 15.4. I also add
information about the nominalizer -na, which combines with the potential stem marked
by -mai ‘potential’, as well as the negative nominalizer -tʃau.","[734, 735]"

husband-1PL/2PL/3.POSS-NEG.NMLZThe negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau can also attach to verbs and adjectives, as seen in
§15.4.7. The examples in (26) show -t͡ʃau with verbs, and examples in (27) illustrate it
with adjectives.

pɨnkɨra ‘good’pɨnkɨra-t͡ʃau ‘bad’uunta ‘big’uunta-t͡ʃau ‘not big’Similarly to -nau, -t͡ʃau can surface as [t͡ʃu] if the vowel /a/ is in a position to be
deleted. For instance, the surface realization of t͡ʃit͡ʃa-t͡ʃau ‘quiet’, in (26) above, is
[t͡ʃi ́t͡ʃat͡ʃu].
10.4.6. Case
Case marking here is viewed in a stricter sense of ""the morphosyntactic
481characterization of noun phrases that is imposed by the structure within which the noun
phrase occurs"" (Payne 1997: 100). True case markers in Wampis are the Nominative
(which is unmarked), the Accusative, the Genitive and the Vocative. Case does not seem
to be a coherent morphosyntactic category in Wampis, as some cases are marked by
phonological means and therefore tightly related to the noun root or derived stem, and
other cases, like the accusative, occur in the form of an enclitic that may or may not be
borne by the head noun.
10.4.6.1. Nominative
Wampis is a nominative-accusative language. Nominative case is zero-marked in
Wampis. Intransitive and transitive lexical S and A argument NPs are treated the same
way in the language in having no overt case marker, and in occurring generally as the
""rst core argument in a sentence.

[Ikama]t͡sukanká=na tuku-ma-jiIkamtoucan=ACCshoot-REC.PT-3.PT+DECL‘Ikam killed the toucan.’48210.4.6.2. Accusative =na
Noun phrases that are Objects of a verb are marked with the morpheme =na. In
fact, =na marks a core argument of the verb that is “not-subject”, as it also marks the
other argument of a ditransitive verb, as will be shown shortly.
(30) napín karámrumhɛɛ
[napi]=nakarama-ru-ma-ha-iboa=ACCdream-APPL-REC.PT-1SG.SBJ-DECL‘I dreamt of a boa (to my detriment).’
The enclitic =na usually occurs in the last element of an NP:
(31) út͡ʃi ʃikápt͡ʃit͡ʃin súsaru
[ut͡ʃi ʃikapit͡ʃi-t͡ʃi]=nasu-sa-ara-uchild little-DIM=ACCgive-ATT-PL-NMLZ‘They gave [him] the little child.’

[ut͡ʃi kakaramaa-tinu]=nauaina-ka-mia-jichild powerful.manCOP-FUT.NMLZ=ACCsee-INTENS-DIST.PT-3.PT+DECL‘He saw a children that is will be a kakaram.’
An important note regarding the realization of the accusative =na is in order.
Because =na frequently appears as the last morphological element of the noun word (or
phrase—only discourse-level morphemes come after case clitics), its vowel usually
undergoes apocope. This apparently has given rise to a further phonetic change in the
accusative, whereby sometimes the nasal consonant /n/ is also lost if =na occupies the
last position. In those cases, the only marking of the accusative is placement of high
483tone—remember that =na induces shift of high tone one mora to the right, as described
in Chapter VI. It will shown that this process is also the origin of the genitive marking
in Wampis. For instance, a common collocation in Wampis is to use the verb hu ‘take’
with nanki [náŋki] ‘spear’ as its object. Often times, the noun nanki surfaces as
[naŋkí]188 when it is the object NP, with the placement of high tone as the only
evidence of accusative marking:
(33) naŋkí húki ̃
nankíhu-ki ̃spear\ACCtake-WHILE.MOVING\3SG.SS‘Having taken the spear…’
However, when more morphology is added to the nominal piece, the underlying
/n/ surfaces. This is not optional; the /n/ always surfaces when another morpheme cooccurs after the accusative, as in (34). Further evidence that =na is present
underlyingly is the surfacing of the entire form /na/ if the morphophonological
environment is appropriate. In (35), the vowel of =na is not deleted because the
(potentially) resulting the cluster [ɲk] in the coda is prohibited. Thus, consider:
(34) naŋkínʃa húki ̃
nanki=na=ʃahu-ki ̃spear=ACC=ADDtake-WHILE.MOVING\3SG.SS‘Having taken the spear too…’188. But notice that this varies with [naŋkín], where the nasal consonant occurs at the end.","[520, 521, 522, 523, 524]"
"127found that this was not always the case with younger speakers. More data is needed to
evaluate this possible generational change.
3.3.3. A&ricativization of /ʃ/
The fricative /ʃ/ and a$ricate /t͡ʃ/ are neutralized following another consonant.
This is formalized by the following rule:
/ʃ/ → [tʃ] / C ___
Examples of the neutralization of /ʃ/ and /t͡ʃ/ are given below. In (91), the last
vowel of the root is deleted, and because [nt ̪t͡ʃ] is an impossible cluster in Wampis, the
intermediate [t ̪] is also deleted (no stop can occur in the margin of a complex coda).
(91)
t͡sawánt͡ʃa
t͡sauant ̪a=ʃa
day=ADD
‘days too’
(92)
hɨ ̃ɰánt͡ʃa
hɨ ̃a=na=ʃa
house=ACC=ADD
‘to the house too’
3.3.4. Dissimilation of a&ricates
After vowel elision, when two a$ricates are to occur next to each other, the ""rst
a$ricate in the sequence becomes an alveolar stop. In the next example, following
128vowel elision,73 the /ʃ/ of =ʃa becomes [t͡ʃ] (as per the rule given in §3.3.3). When this
happens, at an intermediate level, it comes in contact with the /t͡ʃ/ of tikit͡ʃ and
dissimilation occurs.
(93)
tiki ́tt͡ʃa
tikit͡ʃi=ʃa
other=ADD
‘another too’
In practice, the chances that two a$ricates occur adjacent to each other are very
restricted. A limited set of items attaching to a stem that possesses another a$ricate
must occur in the appropriate morphophonological context: =ʃa ‘Additive’, -t͡ʃa
‘Negative’ and the historically related form t͡ʃau ‘Negative nominalizer’.
3.4. Optional variation of consonants
3.4.1. Fricativization of /t͡ʃ/
In word-""nal environments, the a$ricate /t͡ʃ/ can be realized as a fricative,
neutralizing the opposition with the alveolar /ʃ/. The following rule formalizes this
variation:73. In this case, vowel elision applies to the third vowel (from the left). Wampis deletes the last

There is an old su#x -patinu that seems to have functioned as an adjectivilizer;
however, it is no longer productive and is found only in a few items. This su#x can be
roughly translated as ‘propensity to X’, ‘similar to X’, where X is the root with which it
occurs. Apparently -patinu could derive an adjective from a verb, adjective, noun or
even an ideophone (see ‘fragile’ in the example below). The su#x -patinu might be
historically complex, probably composed of an old unidenti""ed formative *-pa and -tinu
‘Attributive’. Examples:
(47)
t͡ʃit͡ʃarpatinu ‘chatty, gossipy’ < *t͡ʃit͡ʃa-ri ̃-patin ‘speak-1PL/2PL/3.POSS-ADJZ’
ʃakarpatinu ‘loose’< *ʃaka-ri ̃-patin ‘water.down-1PL/2PL/3.POSS-ADJZ’pakɨrpatinu ‘fragile’< *pakɨr-patinu ‘sound of object breaking-ADJZ’9.8.5. Augmentative =hakin
The morpheme =hakin derives denominal adjectives that express the idea of450unusual largeness. By extension, =hakin sometimes creates new items with intensi""ed
and negative connotations. The following examples illustrate the use of =hakin.
(48)
tantanɨ ‘belly’ →tantanɨ=hakin ‘pot-bellied’uɨnu ‘mouth’uɨnu=hakin→‘big-mouthed’numpa ‘blood’ →numpa=hakin ‘all bloodied’hii ‘eye’hii=hakin→‘big-eyed’Historically, =hakin likely comes from the nominalization of the stem uaha-ka
‘stand-INTENS’, which has been phonologically eroded, plus the agentive nominalizer -inu.
So, apparently the old construction was a regular nominalization of ‘stand’ in its semicopular function (in which it means ‘become’ §17.6). Synchronically, =hakin sometimes
occurs as a separate word, occurring with the derived noun after a pause and bearing its
own high tone. Some other times, it occurs phonologically bound to the noun it is
deriving.
9.9. Semantic types of adjectives
Dixon (1982) identi""es several types of adjectives in English, based primarily on
their semantics: dimension, physical property, color, human propensity, age, value,
speed. Not all of these types are found in Wampis, but most of them are. Dixon also
indicates that if a language has a distinct class of adjectives, adjectives in that language
at least have the types: age, dimension, value and color. Adjectives that express these
451properties are found in Wampis. On the other hand, I have not found adjectives that can
be associated to the category of ‘Speed’, most items related to this category are either
adverbs or verbs. Table 9.7 summarizes the types of adjectives in Wampis based on
their semantic properties. Examples are also provided.","[489, 490, 491, 492]"

judgements of speakers (and for the most part, based on geography) rather than on
actual data. Much remains to be done on the ""eld of variation for Wampis.
1.6.2. Auto-denomination
The Wampis people refer to themselves simply as [wampi ́s] /uampisa/ ‘Wampis’
21or [ʃuár wampi ́s] (ʃuara uampisa ‘person Wampis’), i.e. ‘Wampis person’. Other common
denominations are [i ́i wampisti ́] (ii uampisa=ti ́ ‘1PL Wampis-PLURAL SPEECH ACT
PARTICIPANT’), [huti ́ wampisti ́] (huti ́ uampisa=ti ́ ‘1PL Wampis-PLURAL SPEECH ACT PARTICIPANT’),which both can be translated as ‘we the Wampis’. Another term used is [ii ʃuarti ́] (ii
ʃuara=ti ́ ‘1PL person-PLURAL SPEECH ACT PARTICIPANT’), i.e. ‘we the people’. Despite the
negative connotations of the word Jivaro in Spanish (where it became practically a
synonym of ‘savage’), some Wampis people also used this term to introduce themselves
when we met, saying they were “Jivaro Wampis”. This is an interesting re-appropriation
of the term, without the negative meaning, as part of their identities. However, this use
of the term Jivaro is not shared by all Jivaroan groups.19
In general, the Wampis can extend the use of the term [ʃuár] /ʃuara/ ‘person’ to
refer to people that they can identify as Jivaroan. In some cases, ʃuara also means
‘enemy’ and is sometimes used to refer to the Awajun in narratives of their past wars
(otherwise, the Wampis used [awarún] /auaruna/ to refer to said group. The term
Jivaro itself is a hispanization of the proto-Jivaroan form *ʃ(i)uara from which modern
[ʃuár] /ʃuara/ is a re/ex (Gnerre 1973). The ethnonyms Shuar, Achuar and Shiwiar all19. The term is particularly insulting for the Shuar of Ecuador. See Katan Jua (2011).","[61, 62]"

The clitic =ka also is used for contrastive focus. In the next example, the
speaker contrast how diabetes is said in Spanish (17.a) and in Wampis (17.b).

The focus =ka is also used to express assertion. In the next example, a person
778dreams that he is going to transform into a jaguar, but no one believes him. The
character exclaims:

In the next example, the narrator re-asserts a new information just provided.
First he introduces the name of the character (“Inchis”) and then he re-asserts this new
information:

Another use of =ka is in parenthetical clauses. Parenthetical clauses are clauses
that are not grammatically required; rather, they add information usually used to
comment, qualify, clarify, or provide an afterthought to an statement. The following are
the ""nal lines of a text in which one of my Wampis teacher was teaching me how some779plants are used to cure wounds. After he ""nishes (“those are [the plants that we use for
healing]”) he adds an afterthought comment which is marked with =ka:
(20) nu ɛ́inawɛi jatsúr haimito i ́ikʲa i ́manisrikʲa ðoktórnumka wɨ ́at͡shi

doctor.’
Finally, I have found that =ka is used in cleft-like constructions, marking a
relative clause in focus function (in this case, the structure in brackets [ ] is relativized
by the non-visible demonstrative nu):
́ ɛiti
(21) wi ́kʲa nekáati túsan wakɨ ́rah núka jũw

NON.VIS=FOChũ=aiti
PROX=COP.3+DECL‘What I want you to know is this.” (Lit.: ‘[What I want, saying: ‘let him know’], is this.’
The focus marker =ka and the conditional -ka (§19.11) are homophonous and
likely related (cf. Overall (2007: 507) for an initial suggestion of this claim in Awajun,
and Haiman (1978) for a cross-linguistic study on the development of conditionals). I
have found some examples of what appears to be the focus =ka being used as a
conditional. This is based on the fact that the conditional is only used in subordinate
780verbs (cf. §19.11), but in the example below =ka occurs on pɨnkɨra ‘good’’, which is an
adjective.

of worms if the plant is good).’
18.5. Additive =ʃa
The additive =ʃa has a variety of functions. Its basic function is to serve to mark
additive focus, i.e. =ʃa expresses “that the predication holds for at least one alternative
of the expression in focus” ((Krifka 1998: 11)).
A simple additive focus function is illustrated in the following example.
(23) ɲawáã arútmaʃa áhaku ti ́maji
jaguar arutama=ʃaa=hak-utimajijaguar power.vision=ADDexist=PT.HAB-NMLZNARR‘There used to be also Arutam jaguar.’
The additive =ʃa is also used to mark the topic of a question:
(24) nihʲamãń t͡ʃiʃa áwak
nihamãt͡ʃi=ʃaa-ua-kamanioc.beer=ADDexist-3.SBJ-Q‘Is there manioc beer?’
The additive =ʃa has also other extended uses when it is used with the781restrictive =kɨ (cf. §18.3).
18.6. Speculative =ʃa
The speculative =ʃa indicates that the speaker judges that the proposition
expressed by his or her utterance is possibly true, but there is a possibility that it is not.
This meaning is usually translated as “may be” (tal vez) by Wampis speakers.
(25) ʃiampi ́n paántam hiámuhɛi ̃nʃa juáwarmaji

18.7. Inferential =t͡su
The clitic =t͡su marks inference or supposition. It attaches mostly to nominals
but can also be received by verbal elements.
The following example comes from a ‘Pear ""lm’ story (see Chafe (1980)). In this
part, some children take a basket full of pears that a man has been collected. When the
man climbs down the tree, he sees the children walking away and notices that one of
his baskets is missing. From the evidence at hand, he infers that it has been the children
who took the basket:
(26) atákʃa út͡ʃi wakɨ ́tki miníɲan íis nitʲát͡suk kasámturkaruiti túsa tú ɨnɨ ́ntɛimʲar iɲɛ́isouwɛiti

‘Again, seeing that the children were walking, saying “They [the children] must have
robbed me”.’
The clitic =t͡su can occur with a verbal su#x -tai that also marks inference
§14.4.5. The di$erence between =t͡su and -tai is not well understood but there is
apparently no semantic change in the inferential meaning added by these morphemes.
In terms of their distribution, when -tai occurs on the verb, =t͡su can occur but only
attached on a nominal constituent. The next example illustrates this. In the passage seen
in the example, a group of women is making tuim /tuimpi/, a type of food that was
served in some special occasions. In this case, the Wampis have just defeated a group of
Awajun, and the warriors, following a ritual of celebration, were to eat tuim for the
occasion. However, one of the women is half-Awajun and half-Wampis. The other
Wampis women and the pamuk (a type of ceremonial leader) notice that the halfAwajun woman’s tuim smells of blood.

fod to smell bad)”.
The inferential =t͡su might be related to the homophonous negative imperfective
verbal su#x -t͡su (cf. §13.4).
18.8. Interrogative =ka
The interrogative is marked with the question marker =ka, as in (28).
(28) ájatɨk awákɨamɨk
aiatɨkɨ auakɨ-a-mɨ=ka
onlyreturn-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q‘Do you only rewind it [i.e. the cassette]?’
Though =ka occurs mostly on nouns and verbs, it actually can be received by
784most parts of speech: pronouns, adjectives and adverbs. The following is an example in
which the interrogative =ka attaches to a noun.
(29) ámɨ wari ́ arútmak wɛi ́nkʲatam
amɨ wariarutama=kawaina-ka-ta-mɨ2SGpower.vision=Qsee-INTENS-IMM.FUT-2SG.SBJwhat‘So you, which Arutam are you going to see?’
An important morphological property of the question clitic marker is that it
occurs before the copula clitics:
(30) pɨ ́ŋkɨrkɛita
pɨnkɨra=ka=ita
good=Q=COP.3
‘Is it good?
The question marker is historically related to the focus marker =ka (cf. §18.4).
However, unlike the focus marker, which never undergoes apocope, the question
marker does undergo apocope, as in (29) above.
18.9. Sudden realization =api and Tag question =api
The clitic =api is primarily used when someone realizes that something has not
gone as expected, with an outcome usually regarded as negative. Unlike the mirative,
the event depicted by =api is typically directly associated to a volitive action done by
the speaker and thus the event is not as strongly counter-expected as with the mirative.
In the next example, a woman who is a big-eater eats up all the food without saving785some for her husband. So, while the realization that there is no more food is sudden,
this is not totally unexpected information (as she herself has been eating it all up):
(31) ɛi ́ʃrunka ampi ́rat͡ʃhapi
aiʃi-ru=na=kaampi-ra-t͡ʃa-ha=apihusband-1SG=acc=FOCsave.food-DISTR-NEG-1SG.SBJ=sud.realz‘Oops, I didn’t save food for my husband!’
And in the following example, the speaker recounts how the villagers agreed in a
community assembly to ask shamans from other communities for help, after they realize
that the children in their village were behaving strangely due to witchcraft.260 She uses
a construction with =api to talk about this situation:
(32)i ́ikʲa húniakur puhut͡ʃuapitji wari ́n áa hui ̃ʃa wari ́n hátak áa
ii=kahuni-a-ku-ripuhu-t͡ʃu=api=iti-hi1PL=FOC do.this-IPFV-SIM-1PL.SS live-NEG.NMLZ=SUD.REALZ=COP-1PL.SBJ+DECL
wari ̃ahui ̃=ʃawari ̃hata=kaawhatexisthere=SPECwhatsickness=Qexist‘We do not live like that, what is there here, which sickness is there?’
In terms of the distribution of =api, it is interesting to notice that in the above
example =api is received by a nominalized form, and in turn =api is followed by a
copula clitic. So it seems that =api behaves distributionally in a similar fashion as the
question marker =ka, which can be received by other non-verbal elements but works at260. Notice, again, that this is—culturally—not totally unexpected information, as sickness and
psychological problems are usually attributed to witchcraft in the Wampis worldview.","[817, 818, 819, 820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825, 826]"

Grammatical particles are function words that work at the level of the clause
and have grammatical meaning. The de""ning property of grammatical particles is that
they are invariable and do not receive in/ection. There are two semi-copula particles in
Wampis which I translate as ‘become’: has ‘become (+stative)’ and hak ‘become (stative)’. They can be described as invariable forms that mark change of state. These
types of particle are not reported for other Jivaroan languages.

hu=nauruka tuku-inuPROX=ACChowhakshoot.PFV-NMLZ become‘How do I shoot this?’
Likely, both has and hak are grammaticalizations of two stems containing the
root uaha ‘stand’. It is likely that has and hak are grammaticalized historically-complex
420forms derived from the verb uaha ‘stand’ used in existential/copular constructions, as
indicated in Table 8.22. With the attenuative aktionsart su#x -sa, uaha combines with a
complement that has stative semantics, though the combinatorial meaning is
inchoative (i.e. change of state). With the intensive aktionsart -ka, uaha yields more
dynamic semantics. ‘>’ indicates hypothesized consecutive functional changes.","[458, 459, 460, 461]"

I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Wampis people who taught me
so much more than their language, specially to Juan Luis Nuningo Puwai and his
family, Shapiom Noningo Sesén, Atilio Nuningo Noningo, Andrés Nuningo Graña, Dina
Ananco Ahuananchi, Lidia Wajarai, Clara Navarro, Josué Yacum, Eder Yacum, and
Óscar Jimpikit and his family. I am grateful to the Wampis leaders Juan Luis Nuningo,
Julio Hinojosa and Alfonso Graña for allowing me to carry out my research and for
helping me make contacts in di$erent communities of Kanus.
In Jaén, my appreciation to the people of Centro Waimaku and to the Carranza
family for welcoming me at their house at di$erent times while traveling for ""eld work.
I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Professor Doris L. Payne, for
supporting me all these years. I really do not know where I would be without Doris’
guidance; certainly not ""nishing a dissertation. She has very patiently read and re-read
through every piece of this work and has given my chaotic thoughts a legible form. Our
conversations have greatly enriched my understanding not only of language, but of how
to do research in general. Scott DeLancey and Spike Gildea are great professors and
scholars, and great people. As their student or assistant, I have learned a lot from them.
I am honored to have them in my committee and grateful for their comments and
criticism. I am grateful to Claudia Holguín for supporting my project since we met for
the ""rst time and for her comments on my work.
ixAll of my friends at the Department of Linguistics of the University of Oregon
have helped me keep my sanity at acceptable levels, especially Rosa Vallejos (and Óscar
and Álvaro), Michael Ahland, Yolanda Valdez. Shahar Shirtz, Manuel Otero, Danielle
Barth, Ellen Kress and Matt Stave provided insightful comments on the Wampis data or
helped with my questions about English. My thanks also to all of my professors and sta$
at the Department of Linguistics and to the people at Romance Languages, with whom I
worked when I started my graduate career in Oregon. My research was supported by

I would be nowhere without the love and support of my parents, Isaac Jaime
and Zadith. My sister Ketty has been my best friend since before I was born, and I am
always happy to see her, her husband Yuri and my nephew Iván. My in-laws are always
supportive of our endeavors, I am especially grateful to Teresa Arellano for everything
she has done for us.
I am indebted to Adriana Da Silva, who has helped me greatly with the maps.
Adriana not only found time to help me, but also to be a great mother to our sons
Joaquín Alejandro, Nicolás Jaime and Octavio Carlo. All of you are the greatest thing to
ever happened upon me. Language fails me to express how much I love you all.xTo the Wampis People.
To the memory of the dear people who left this physical world while I was
writing this dissertation, especially my grandmother Migue and my Oregonian brother
James D. Wood.
To Adriana, to my parents, to Joaquín, Nicolás and Octavio.xiTABLE OF CONTENTS

INTRODUCTION
1.1. Introduction
This dissertation o$ers a comprehensive grammar of the Wampis (Huambisa)
language, as it is currently spoken in the Santiago river1 area of Peru. The language
name is written <Wampís> (the underlying form is /uampisa/, which is pronounced
[wampi ́s]) by the speakers); therefore, assuming there is no accent mark in the English
alphabet, throughout this dissertation I will use the term Wampis to refer to the
language. The present work is based mainly on the variety spoken in the Middle
Santiago, in the communities of Puerto Galilea, Huabal and Boca Chinganaza; and on
the Upper Santiago variety as spoken in the community of Candungos. Though some
di$erences between the Middle and Upper Santiago varieties occur and will be referred
to in some parts of this work, no major statements about Wampis internal variation will
be made (however, some basic notes on this topic are given in §1.6.1). The claims made
in this work are based on the analysis of primary data gathered via extensive ""eldwork
in Wampis communities. Wampis is spoken by around 10,000 people in the1. The Santiago river is known by the name of Kanus (/kanusa/) by the Wampis.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"

Notice that in some cases the overt mention of the comparand can be dropped in
the coordinated pre-posed NP. The comparand, however, is referred to in the main
predication:

The verb ii ‘see’ usually occurs with apatu ‘put together’, in which case ‘see’
takes the subordinating morphology:

seeing (i.e. considering), I am wiser at ""shing.’)9.7.3.2. Comparison of equality
Comparison of equality is done with mɨtɨka ‘equal’ (cf. mɨtɨ ‘full’). The following
443examples illustrate a comparison of equality.
(35) wi ́hʲɛɛ̃ mɨtɨ ́kɛitmɨ

too.’
9.7.3.3. “Less” comparison
In sentences that can be considered as equivalents of “less”-comparisons, the
adjective occurs with the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau and with the verb imatika (derived
from the intensi""er ima).
(37) amɨ ́kʲa wi ́ja namák mãátnumka imátikʲam jat͡ʃát͡ʃuitmɨ

skilled.’
9.7.3.4. Adjectives in superlative constructions
There is no superlative form in Wampis. Speakers use the intensi""ers ima or ti,
or ʃiira ‘very’ and the adjective in an copular construction. There is apparently no
di$erence in meaning when using either ima, ti or ʃiira, however ʃiira occupies a
di$erent syntactic position than ima and ti (see §9.6). Notice that while this is a copular
construction, it di$ers from a typical (typical in terms of frequency) attributive
construction. In the latter, the subject usually occurs with the focus =ka and the
adjective is marked with the copula or in a verbless predication. Example (39)–(40)
illustrate this:
(39) ni ́ŋkʲa imá ɨsármajɛiti
ni ̃=kaimaɨsarama=aiti3SG=FOCINTStall=COP.3+DECL‘He is very tall’(40) ni ́ŋkʲa imá ɨsárma
ni ̃=kaimaɨsarama3SG=FOCINTStall‘He is tall’
On the other hand, in the superlative construction, it is the adjective which
445occurs focalized with =ka, the copula marks the subject. However, according to my
teachers, this construction can also have an attributive (not necessarily superlative)
meaning. The meaning of the intensi""er apparently is augmented in this construction,
so I have tried to mimic this augmentation by translating it as “very, very”.
(41) nijɛ́iti ʃi ́ir ɨsármaka
ni ̃=aitiʃiiraɨsarama=ka3SG=COP.3+DECLverytall=FOC‘He is very, very tall.’ or ‘He is the tallest.’(42) ni ̃jɛ́iti imá ɨsarmaka
ni ̃=aitiimaɨsarama=ka3SG=COP.3+DECLINTStall=FOC‘He is very, very tall.’ or ‘He is the tallest.’
9.8. Derivation of adjectives
9.8.1. Zero derivation
There are examples of zero derivation between adjectives, nouns and verbs, but
the direction of historical development is not clear in all cases:
(43)
sɨnt͡ʃi ‘strong’, cf. sɨnt͡ʃi ‘strengh’ (N) (<From Quechua sint͡ʃi ‘strong, valorous’)
suata ‘dirty’, cf. suata ‘tangled forest’ (N)
aʃama ‘cowardly’, cf. aʃama ‘be afraid’ (V)
sapiha ‘nervous, cowardly’, cf. sapiha ‘be afraid’
The intensi""er adverb imani has been lexicalized as an adjective with the form446iman, in which case it has a meaning that can be translated as ‘superior (in quality or
skill)’. However, this item may be analyzed as a unique category, midway between
adverbs and adjectives, as it does not host case. For instance, in (45) iman is treated
more like some sort of adverb in its form, though functionally it is modifying the noun
head:
(44) puhútnaka i ́man iit͡ʃu ɛ́ɛɲa
puhu-ta=na=kaimanii-t͡ʃau a-inalive-NMLZ=ACC=FOCINTSsee-NEG.NMLZ COP-PL.IPFV‘They do not see a superior life.’ (i.e. ‘They do not think about a better life’.)
At the same time, iman can receive the negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau, which derives
the opposite meaning of ‘unskilled, not so good’ (by extension, it can also mean ‘fool’).
So, in this case, it seems to be treated more like an adjective:
(45) ʃuár i ́mant͡ʃu
ʃuara iman-t͡ʃau
person INTS-NEG.NMLZ
‘unskilled person’
9.8.2. Derivation with -taku
The su#x -taku is an adjectivalizer that is unique to adjectives.172 This su#x has
a gradability function. In lay terms, it can be described as a su#x that creates new172. There is one form where apparently -taku is lexicalized: maakɨtaku [maáktaku] ‘more or
less’ (Lit.: ‘partly su#cient’) that is used adverbially or attributively. The root maakɨ ‘enough,
su#cient, fully’ is an interjection typically used to express thanks (i.e. ‘It is enough’) but can be
used occasionally as an adjective or adverb.","[482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487]"
"16The Wampis society remains one of the poorest minority groups in Peru. As
migration of young Wampis people to cities increases, so does pressure from Spanish
and other languages. Increasing contact with outsiders who seek opportunities to
engage in logging or gold-mining adds to this pressure too. The location of the Wampis
territory in a political borderline and the fact that this territory is an area of natural
resource exploration (the region is rich in gold and other minerals, exploration for oil is
going on) also have put the Wampis in a very sensitive situation. Hence, the Wampis
are a vulnerable group and the language has been listed as having the status of
“vulnerable” in the Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger (Moseley 2010).
1.6.1. Varieties of Wampis
An examination of Wampis-internal linguistic variation has not been attempted,
nor was it the goal of the research leading to the writing of this dissertation. However,
at ""rst glance it can be stated that variation in Wampis is mostly lexical and phonetic,
with some di$erences in the pronunciation of a few grammatical morphemes. There
exists mutual intelligibility between Wampis speakers from di$erent areas. There are
two large areas where Wampis is spoken: the Santiago river and the Morona River. The
Santiago and Morona rivers run almost parallel to each other, but they are separated by17a mountain range, called Kampankis. I did not collect data from the Morona river area.
Along the Santiago river, there are three general areas: the lower Santiago is mostly
Awajun territory, the Middle and Upper Santiago is considered Wampis territory. The
one variety of the Santiago area that always was suggested to me as being divergent
from other varieties of the Santiago river region is the one spoken on the Caterpiza
river, a tributary of the Santiago. Though I have been unable to go to the Caterpiza
river, I have witnessed dialogues between people of the Middle Santiago and Caterpiza,
and they can certainly communicate with each other. This suggests that the Caterpiza
variety is actually not very divergent from the other dialects of Wampis,15 though it
seems to be the most sociolinguistically marked16 of the dialects spoken in the Santiago
basin.
The study of the varieties of Wampis, as for most other Jivaroan languages, is
yet to be fully explored. García-Rendueles (1996–1999) outlined his view of the15. The Caterpiza river is located on the east side of the Santiago river. Most Wampis
communities in the Middle Santiago river are located on the west side. This probably contributes
to the Caterpiza dialect being perceived as di$ering from others. There is also the matter of
contact: it may be the case that the Caterpiza dialect is relatively divergent, but since Wampis
people move around and visit or trade with each other, they can have a certain level of
understanding, simplifying their speech when they communicate.
16. By “marked” here I mean that it is perceived as di$erent. There is no strong negative
sociolinguistic attitude towards the people who speak this dialect.","[56, 57, 58]"

(54) juákia
iu-á-kia
eat-HIAF-FAM.IMP
‘Eat!’ (Order given with anger)
However, -kia can also occur with the attenuative; thus the sentiment of ‘anger’
must be related to the familiar sense of this su#x, rather than being an intrinsic
property of the su#x. Notice that with the attenuative, the familiar imperative surfaces
with the reduced form [sia].
(55) ii ́sia huní wɨ ́arɨ ̃
ii-sa-kiahu=niwɨ-ara-ɨ ̃see-ATT-FAM.IMPPROX=ALLgo-PL-3.PFV‘Look! They went over here.’
The plural for the familiar imperative is done by adding a form that surfaces as
[rua]. This can be hypothesized as a phonological reduction of the plural -ara, the
subject nominalizaer –u, and the copula a; i.e. a nominalization construction (‘be ones
who [do] X’!). For the moment, I gloss -rua as a plural imperative form, as I have few
examples of this enabling a more general statement.
(56) juákiarua
iu-á-kia-rua

‘[You (PL)] eat!’67514.4.3.3. Jussive
The jussive involves the expression of positive commands, desires or permission
directed toward a third person addressee. The jussive is marked with the su#x -ti. The
jussive has probably arisen from the historical con/ation of the immediate future -ta
and the third person marker -ĩ, although there is no trace of nasalization in the jussive
(but recall that -i ̃ surfaces very often as an oral vowel (cf. §14.3.2)).

anen (magical song) too, saying “Let Nunkui give me [good luck]”.’In concordance with the aktionsart stem to which the jussive attaches, the plural
is marked with the non-imperfective plural marker -ara, which, as was seen, is used for
3 persons (§5.4.2).
(58) juáwarti
iu-áu-ara-ti
eat-HIAF-PL-JUSS
‘Let them eat!’
The hortative also functions as a counterpart of the imperative in reported676speech. Thus, in the next example taken from a conversation, the command is
understood as addressing the interlocutor:
(59) káʃi miɲi ́ti túsa turámɨnawɛɛ wilsonhɛi ̃
kaʃiuini-titu-satu-rama-ina-ua-iwilson-hai ̃tomorrowcome.PFV-TIsay-SUB say-2.OBJ-PL.IPFV-3.SBJ-DECLWilson-COM‘They tell you to come with Wilson tomorrow.’ (Lit.: ‘Saying “Tomorrow that he comes”,
they tell you, “with Wilson”.’
14.4.3.4. Hortative
The hortative -mi signals the speaker appeal or encouragement toward the
addressee to bring about a future state of a$airs. The hortative is generally understood
as having a ‘you+me’ subject .
(60) umármi
uma-ra-mi
drink.PFV-DISTR-HORT
‘Let’s drink.’When there is more than one addressee, the plurality of addressees is marked
with the non-imperfective plural -ara, which goes before the hortative su#x.
(61) umárarmi
uma-ra-ara-mi
drink-DISTR-PL-HORT
‘Let’s drink.’
There is another su#x -tai that seems to also function as an hortative. In the
data gathered for Wampis, it is mostly found mostly in formulaic phrases, as in (62).
677(62) arúm wɛi ́ɲiatɛi
aruma uai-nai-a-tai
latersee-RECIP-IPFV-HORT‘See you later’ (Lit.: ‘Let us see each other later.)’
Unlike all other su#xes related to the domain of command and manipulation,
the su#x -tai can attach to an imperfective stem. This seems a little odd, as the
morpheme -tai seems to be based on the basic immediate future -ta (which is likely also
the source for the imperative). As stated before, the future always takes the aktionsart/
perfective stem, thus the use of an imperfective stem in this case, from a structural point
of view, seems unexpected.
14.4.3.5. Prohibitive -pa
The prohibitive -pa is used with negative commands. It addresses a 2 singular by
default. If a 2 plural person is addressed, then the plural form -rupa is used. The su#x rupa is historically composed of a plural formative *-ru and the prohibitive -pa.
Optionally, speakers can use the su#x -pa followed by the 2 plural subject su#x -rumɨ.
There is no di$erence between using -rupa or -pa-rumɨ. The next examples illustrate the
use of the prohibitive.
(63) náki ɛ́ipʲa

CAUS-bathe-LOAF-APPR-PL.PROH‘[With] Very hot [water] do not bathe [her].’
Since the prohibitive typically refers to actions or events that are not desired to
occur, it very frequently occurs following the apprehensive su#x, as can be appreciated
in the above examples.
14.4.4. Apprehensive -ai
The Wampis apprehensive modality is morphologically codi""ed via the use of
the su#x -ai. The apprehensive serves to express that a potential event is seen as highly
undesirable. Following Lichtenberk, it can be said that the Wampis apprehensive
involves a miscellany of epistemic and attitudinal semantics related to the coding of
“the speaker’s degree of certainty about the factual status of a proposition and with his
or her attitude concerning the desirability of the situation encoded in the clause” (1995:
293). The apprehensive in Wampis covers the domains equivalents to what is typically679codi""ed with lest-clauses (Dixon 2002) and évitatifs (François 2003) in other languages.
Unlike the morphemes seen in §14.4.3, the prohibitive occurs with all persons. With the
second person, it occurs with the prohibitive -pa as was seen in the previous section.
Third person does not distinguish between singular and plural. Table 14.10 shows a
paradigm of person marking with the apprehensive.","[714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720]"

and carry a spear [náŋki] (/nanki). Women wear colorful earrings [aki ́tɛi ̃] (/akitai/),
usually made of toucan feathers and giant beetle wings, and put on their typical red or
purple/blue dresses [tarát͡ʃ] (/tarat͡ʃi/), which they tie up on the right shoulder. Piercing
in the lower lip and nose was practiced until about three generations ago, but it is no
longer practiced. Some elderly people I met still exhibit these piercings.
For special occasions or celebrations, the Wampis still paint their faces with
thick lines in red. Facial tattoos were also used. In fact, elderly people, still conserve
their tattoos. Tattoo and face-painting patterns represent the possession of [arútam] (/
arutama/), a vision of power given by the most important Jivaroan spiritual entity (see
§2.7). Tattoos were also apparently made to distinguish individuals within a family.
People I asked about this did not remember the speci""c details, though.
1.8. This dissertation
This dissertation constitutes the ""rst attempt ever at providing a complete
grammatical description of Wampis. To the best of my knowledge, there is no
previously published grammatical description, or even a sketch, of Wampis. The
grammar is based on extensive ""eldwork carried out at di$erent moments in 2008,282011, 2013 and 2014. This grammar is divided into twenty one chapters. Following this
introduction, Chapter II provides brief notes on the Wampis people. Chapters III trough
VI provide analyses of di$erent aspects of Wampis phonology, phonetics,
morphophonology and prosody. Chapter VII constitutes an introduction to morphology
and word classes. Chapter VIII provides a description of all closed word classes in
Wampis. Next, Chapter IX is dedicated to adjectives. The noun, noun phrase and
adpositional phrases are described in Chapters X and XI. Chapter XII is an introduction
to the study of the verb, which is then followed by an in-depth study of verbal
morphology: “derivational” level in Chapter XIII, and “in/ectional” level in Chapter
XIV. Chapter XV looks at nominalization. Chapter XVI o$ers an analysis of the simple
clause, followed by an analysis of verbless, copular and existential constructions in
Chapter XVII. Chapter XVIII describes discourse-oriented and mood clitics. Complex
clause constructions, including subordination, complementation and relativization, are
analyzed in Chapters XIX and XX. Finally, some concluding comments are provided in
Chapter XXI.
1.9. Theoretical framework
The approach in this work re/ects many ""ndings and discussions established or29now generally assumed from the development of comparative philology, Structuralism,
and even some formalist syntactic frameworks. However, my understanding of language
relies on an idea that does not ""t within a structuralist or formalist (Chomskyan)
theories. That is, that language use, grammar structure, and cognition are closely
connected. Language is a dynamic system, adapted and constrained by our ways of
categorizing our experience. This is a general principle that guides my approach to the
study of language in general and, in particular, my analysis of Wampis.
The main paradigm that informs this dissertation is the functional-typological
approach, with an appreciation of historical developments in understanding the current
state of Wampis. Functionalism is not one uni""ed theory, but in its various iterations it
rejects formalism as an explanation of language facts. Functionalism claims that
grammar is not an autonomous system, but it is part of a system of human
communication composed of a cognitive representation system and a communicative
coding system (Givón 2002a: 7). In that regard, the functionalist approach rejects the
idea that a theory of grammar can ""nd explanatory adequacy (Chomsky 1965) by
circularly resorting to a purportedly autonomous language module, ultimately linked to
a distinctly abstract untestable notion of Universal Grammar. Thus, it can be said that30the most basic epistemological distinction between functionalism and formalism is what
counts as an explanation (Payne 1999b). A formal model often serves simply as a
“restatement of the facts at a higher level of generalization” (Givón 1979: 5) and, in
that regard, it lacks explanatory strength. Functionalism, on the other hand, seeks
explanations for formal structures in the explanatory domains of semantics,
grammaticalization, discourse-oriented communicative, cognitive constraints or broader
cognitive pressures (such as attention and representation, for example). Within this
view, language is seen as a set of tools “whose forms are adapted to their functions”
(DeLancey 2001a). Hence, language structure has an adaptive motivation—i.e. it is the
way it is because it re/ects constraints in language use, where language suits speakers’
needs.
Functional studies often incorporate a typological domain in their analyses.
Within this dissertation’s framework, linguistic typology is viewed as the study of
language variation and of the limits on that variation. It is assumed in this work that
there are language-speci""c constructions, but also that di$erent language structures
can, from one language to another, encode the same type of function or communicative
job. Cross-linguistic recurrent patterns are often functionally motivated and need to be31explained. In this sense, typology is not merely descriptive, but also it can be
explanatory (Croft 2003: 284). In my analyses of Wampis data I incorporate typological
analytical tools and try to relate the data to categories and constructions found in this
language to those that are, or are not, found recurrently cross-linguistically. I try not to
provide a simple inventory of features; rather, my use of a typological framework has
been motivated by the necessity to understand (and ultimately seek to explain) how
certain Wampis constructions work by relating them to known linguistic patterns.
However, I always de""ne the categories found in the Wampis data in their own terms,
explicitly characterizing them and providing examples of how formal structures are
paired to functions in this language. By comparing language-speci""c structures of
languages, including those of Wampis, we can eventually better propose hypotheses
addressing how di$erent linguistic functions could have developed and come to be
encoded in various languages. Ultimately, we can try to explain how those linguistic
functions relate to human cognition in general.
Often, grammatical units are not synchronically transparently motivated. Most
of the time, the ontological opacity of grammatical categories is a consequence of
language change. In this dissertation, as I said, language is seen as a dynamic system,32i.e. a system that is continuously being re-created by communicative activity. That
means that, although I recognize the methodological value of di$erentiating synchrony
from diachrony, I believe that maintaining the rigid boundary of this dichotomy
prevents us from obtaining better understanding of how diversity in grammatical
structure has arisen (see, for instance, Givón (1971; 1979), Lehmann (1985), Bybee
(1985), Heine et al. (1991), Gildea (1998), among others). Therefore, I also use the
framework of grammaticalization (or historical processes of change) to help explain
patterns in a language. The main premise here is that “in grammaticalization, functional
shifts lead, and structural change follows” (DeLancey 1994: 4).
While this dissertation is grounded within the theoretical stand point provided
by functional approaches, I take functionalism as a starting point, and not as an end
point. It is not my goal to prove a theory or to make it look better than others, for
“theory informs and shapes, but does not control” (Rice 2006: 262). Rather, I seek to
build knowledge from empirical data and transmit that knowledge (of the Wampis
language) as clearly and as comprehensively as I can. From that perspective, the
grammatical description proposed throughout this work generally follows a tradition
that has been referred to as Basic Linguistic Theory (Dixon 1997). In this approach to33grammar description, the researcher aims to describe a set of facts with no restrictive
theoretical implications (Dryer 2006). This is especially important in analyzing an
under-documented language such as Wampis, because it allows the researcher to be
open to new phenomena and to formulate statements that are supported by the data as
well as to test typological claims. In this regard, and from a practical standpoint, my
analysis of Wampis has also bene""ted from consulting literature on writing a grammar,
such as Payne and Weber (Eds.) (2006) or Ameka et al. (Eds) (2006)
1.10. Methodological considerations: !eldwork and data
This dissertation is based largely on primary natural data gathered from
extensive periods of ""eldwork. Underlying this idea is the ""rm belief that ""eldwork is
an indispensable methodological activitiy in writing a grammar, as this is the principal
way to study a language as a holistic system, i.e. as a system that functions within a
socio-cultural human network, as well as within historical and political contexts with
ties to the past and, as I have been reminded many times by the Wampis, to the future.
1.10.1. Fieldwork
Fieldwork was conducted in the Wampis communities of Puerto Galilea, Huabal,
Boca Chinganaza and Candungos, all located in the political Department of Amazonas,34Peru. Additionally, I worked in the towns of Jaen and in Peru’s capital, Lima. In Jaen
and Lima there are small populations of Wampis immigrants, some of whom
accompanied me to the Wampis villages. Figure 1.3 shows the locations of the Wampis
villages where I carried out ""eldwork. I have been working with Wampis speakers since
2007, and made trips to their communities in 2008, 2011 and 2013. To go there from
Lima involves at least three days in di$erent climate/altitudes, transportation by bus,
car, boat; and diverse (usually not good) road conditions. Typically, the route that I
followed was Lima-Jaen-Bagua-Santa Maria de Nieva. From the town of Santa Maria de
Nieva one takes a boat to the Santiago River district, where the Wampis territory is
located. Because it is a long trip, some extra considerations were given to equipment
and lodging.
I established the town of Jaen as my “base camp” for going into and arriving
from Wampis territory. Jaen is located in the Department of Cajamarca, very close to
the Department of Amazonas. In Jaen, I stayed with a local, non-Wampis, family, but
worked with di$erent Wampis speakers who were currently living there. It takes at least

discussed in order to better understand the behavior of the copula a, copula clitics and
the existential. An analysis of their functions follows afterward.
17.5.2. Morphosyntactic distinctions
17.5.2.1. The expression of TAM categories
With regard to TAM categories, the following principles distinguish the copula a,
the copula clitics and the existential a in Wampis (they are explained in the subsequent
discussion, below):• The copula a is used in non-present declarative moods (including past and future
739tense references), tag questions and subordinated constructions.","[778, 779, 780]"
"With regard to being the head of an NP, adjectives in Wampis cannot assume
this function. For the related language Awajun, Overall (2007: 142) mentions that it is
possible for adjectives to occur in headless NPs. The next example from Awajun
illustrates this construction:
(1) níŋka muúntan ʃináu
nĩ-ka[muunta-na] ʃina-u3SG-FOC [big-ACC]sing+IMPFV-REL‘it (the kúgkup bird) sang with a big voice’ (Lit. it sang a big (one)) (Overall 2007: 142)427I have no attestation of that type of NP in the Wampis database. In fact, notice
that a copula occurs with the adjective in Wampis:
(2) ʃikápt͡ʃia húna amástahmɨ
[ʃikapat͡ʃi=a hu=na]ama-sa-ta-hamɨ[small=COPgive-ATT-IMM.FUT-1SG>2SG+DECLPROX=ACC]‘I am going to give you this little one.’ (Lit.: ‘I am going to give you this [who] is little.’)
The above example shows a relative clause: the copula is relativized with the
proximal demonstrative. The proximal demonstrative, at the same time, functions as the
head of the object NP.
Concerning modi""cation of nouns, nouns can modify the head of an NP;
however, in that case, word order is much looser. In a quick count of 40 NPs from texts
where a noun to noun modi""cation occurs, 75% (=30) of cases observed the modi""er
noun coming before the head. An example is presented in (3).
(3) núu ʃuár páki áhaku ti ́maji
nuʃuara pakiNON.VIS person peccarya-hak-utimajiexist-PT.HAB-NMLZNARR‘That person peccary used to exist.’
This is unlike modi""cation with adjectives, where there is a very strong
preference for Noun-Adjective order. Notice that relative clauses also follow this
pattern, occurring after the noun head. This seems to con""rm that the preferred
position for the modi""cation of the head of the NP is post-nominal. To exemplify this428point, consider adjectives like uunta ‘big’. When uunta is used in a pre-nominal position,
it acquires the meaning of ‘adult person, elder person, respected person’ (by extension,
uunta is used as a noun when meaning ‘elder’ or ‘ancestor’):
(4) úun pirút͡ʃ ʃuarán mãh́ akuiti
uunta Pirut͡ʃi ʃuara=namã=hak-u=itielderkill=HAB.PT-NMLZ=COP.3+DECLPirut͡ʃi person=ACC‘The elder Piruch used to kill people.’
In that respect, uunta can act as a noun, heading an NP:
(5) óo úun Limánmajakɛiti
auuuntaLima=numa=ia=ka=itiMEDadult.personLima=LOC=ABL=Q=COP.3‘Is that guy (i.e. ‘adult person’) from Lima?’
But when uunta occurs post-nominally, it is clearly adjectival:
(6) ou ʃuar úun hɨ ̃áji
auʃuaruunta hɨ ̃ájiMEDpersonbigarrive+HIAF-3.PT+DECL‘That big person just arrived.’
Interestingly, in lexicalized compound nominals that have an adjective
incorporated, the adjective occurs ""rst and there is no possibility at all that the
Adjective-Noun compound can be interpreted as an adjective modifying a noun. For
instance, uun_iauaã is a compoun noun derived from iauaã ‘dog’ and uunta ‘big’. So,
uun_iauaã [uún ɲawaã] ‘jaguar’ is never interpreted as ‘big dog’; the only way to say
‘big dog’ is by using the canonical Noun-Adjective order:429(7) ɲawáã úun
iauaã uunta
dogbig‘big dog’(8) úun ɲawáã
uun_iauaã
‘jaguar’
With regard to possession, unlike nouns, adjectives cannot be possessors in
Wampis. On the other hand, like nouns, adjectives can be possessed, but when they are
possessed, their meaning and function is that of (i.e. they become) a possessed noun.
Thus, when uunta ‘big’ is possessed, it acquires the meaning of ‘elder one’, ‘ancestor’
and can head NPs:
(9) i ́iɲa úuntrika papáŋhɛɛ̃ júha hakáru
iinauunta-ri ̃=kapapanku=hai ̃1PL.GEN ancestor-1PL/2PL/3.POSS=FOC raft=COM
iuhahak-ara-uwalk.in.group HAB.PT-PL-NMLZ
‘Our ancestors used to travel by raft.’
Now compare the following sentences that contain the word ɨsarama ‘long’. In
(10), ɨsarama functions as an adjective, modifying the noun head ‘snake’. Meanwhile, in
(11) ɨsarama is possessed and is functioning as a noun in a genitive construction:430(10) nápi ɨsáram tɨpáwɛɛ
napiɨsaramasnake longtɨpa-ua-i
lie.down-3.SBJ-DECL‘A long snake is lying down.’(11) napi ́n ɨsármari ̃n iistá

The other points that appear in Table 9.2, such as the morphology associated
with adjectives (including case and postpositions), gradability and derivation of
adjectives, are discussed in detail in the next subsections.
9.5. Morphology associated with adjectives
Adjectives have a unique su#x -taku that derives another adjective that acquires
the meaning equivalent of ‘PROPERTY-ish’. This su#x is explained in §9.8.2.
Adjectives can also receive a restricted number of morphemes that also occur on
noun. Table 9.3 shows the su#xes that are shared by adjectives and nouns.
Table 9.3. Nominal su#xes that can be received by adjectives
MorphemeGloss-t͡ʃi‘Diminutive’-t͡ʃau‘Negative nominalizer’Possessed noun markers (see §9.4)4319.5.1. Diminutive -t͡ʃi with adjectives
The diminutive -t͡ʃi can occur with adjectives as well as nouns. As it is typical of
diminutives, -t͡ʃi does not only express smallness but it also can convey an idea of
endearment. The marking of the diminutive in both the modi""er and head is optional,
but it occurs in the majority of examples from texts. This suggests that the adjective
tends to have some agreement with the noun head when marked with the diminutive.

There is a number of adjectives where the diminutive is lexicalized. Some
examples are presented in (13).

The negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau and adjectives
Some adjectives can be derived from adjectives, nouns and verbs using the
negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau. One of the functions of verbal nominalization is to modify
432nouns (i.e. via relative clauses), so it seems that through this function -t͡ʃau can derive
items that become primarily modi""cational in function. Speci""cally, -tʃau derives
opposites of certain adjectives, as many do not have a lexical antonym pair. -t͡ʃau is
specially productive with evaluative adjectives. This is an interesting ""nding, as it
reveals a semantic tendency of Wampis lexicon related to adjectives: most adjectives
expressing VALUE are positively oriented and do not have a lexical opposite. Examples
are presented in (11)
(14)
pɨ ́nkɨra ‘good’—pɨ ́nkɨra-t͡ʃau ‘bad’t͡ʃit͡ʃirama ‘strong (of current)’ —t͡ʃit͡ʃirama-t͡ʃau ‘weak’iman ‘superior (of quality or skill)’—iumintV—iumin-t͡ʃau ‘salty, sour’—iupi-t͡ʃau ‘docile’167‘sweet’iupia ‘be wild’iman-t͡ʃau ‘unskilled’9.5.3. Adjectives and case and post-positional clitics
Phonologically, adjectives can also host case and adpositional clitics (because of
the very nature of cliticization in Wampis). However no adjective can stand alone and
receive case or adpositional marking. However no adjective can stand alone and receive167. This word almost always occurs as [jumi ́n], but it occurs as [jumi ́ntri ̃] when it receives the
1PL/2PL/3 possessed marker -ri ̃. So, it seems that, synchronically, it is still possible to analyze this
word as having a last /tV/ syllable. The deletion of the last syllable (/tV/) is the consequence of
vowel elision: after V is elided, /t/ is deleted because /nt/ is an impossible coda. V is always
deleted because it is in a position to be deleted. This a very regular Wampis pattern.","[467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473]"

CLOSED WORD CLASSES
8.1. Introduction
This chapter is dedicated to closed word classes, which are those that are
composed of “a ""xed and usually small number of members” (Schachter & Shopen
2007: 3). The closed classes of Wampis are: pronouns, demonstratives, interrogative
words, non-numeral quanti""ers, numerals, interjections and grammatical particles.
There are two words that do not ""t in any category and constitute their own classes:
tikit͡ʃi ‘other’ and uɨantu ‘group’. In addition, due to their morphosyntactic properties I
also discuss in this chapter two word classes that are not strictly closed: ideophones and
adverbs. Ideophones are an open class in the sense that the most simple way to create a
new ideophone is by imitating any sound, so the inventory of ideophones can always be
expanded in theory. The reason for considering adverbs in this chapter is that the only
adverbializer in Wampis (which only derives time-adverbs) is no longer productive in
the language; hence, in practice Adverbs constitute a semi-closed class. The word
classes are presented in this way: §8.2 describes pronouns, §8.3 provides an analysis of
determiners, which is followed by a description of the word tikit͡ʃi ‘other’ in §8.4.
329Question words are analyzed in §8.5. Adverbs are analyzed in §8.6. Sections §8.7 and
§8.8 describe non-numeral and numeral quanti""ers, respectively. Section §8.9 discuses
the word uɨantu ‘group’, and §8.10 discusses the (little) evidence for conjunctions.
Interjections and ideophones are described in §8.11 and §8.12, respectively. Finally,
§8.13 comments on two grammatical particles found in Wampis.
8.2. Pronouns
Pronouns constitute a class of words that are free forms and that can ""ll the
position of an NP in a clause. Pronouns are referential devices that need an anaphoric
or cataphoric referent in the discourse. In Wampis, pronouns generally have most of the
distributional and morphological properties of nouns. However, di$erently from nouns,
pronouns cannot be possessed and cannot be modi""ed. Pronouns do not receive
vocative case either.
8.2.1. Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns are related to the distinction of grammatical person. Wampis
distinguishes between singular and plural personal pronoun forms. Table 8.1 shows the
personal pronouns found in Wampis.","[368, 369, 370]"
"703in the grammar of Wampis where one can see an old Jivaroan instrumental, probably
historically con/ated with the locative, in the nominalizer -tai ̃. This is an speculative
suggestion that remains to be more thoroughly analyzed.
15.4.5. Set II nominalizer -u, ‘subject nominalizer’
The subject nominalizer -u encodes di$erent semantic roles—agent, experiencer/
undergoer, force—all of which map onto the A/S participant of the verb. Unlike -inu,
which encodes prototypically animate agentive participants, -u can denote an animate
or inanimate participant. For descriptive convenience, I use the term “subject
nominalizer” to refer to the nominalizer -u. As mentioned in §15.3, an important feature
of Set II nominalizers is that, unlike Set I nominalizers, they can nominalize verb stems
which have aspectual information.
(21)
Examples with the imperfective -a
arakama ‘plant’→arakama-a-u [arákmou]‘planter’ha‘be sick’→ha-a-u [háoo]‘sick person’nɨka‘know’→nɨka-a-u [nɨkóo]‘wise’t͡ʃit͡ʃa‘speak’→t͡ʃit͡ʃa-a-u [t͡ʃit͡ʃóo]‘speaker’Examples with aktionsart (perfective stem), -ra ‘distributed action, -ka ‘intensive’
auama ‘cut hair’→auama-ra-u [awámaru]ha‘be sick’→ha-ka-u [hakóo]unuima ‘learn’→unuima-ra-u [unúimaru]→ɨɨma-ka-u [ɨɨ ́mkoo]‘one who cut his/her hair’‘dead, corpse’
‘educated’(‘onelearned’)
ɨɨma‘go forward’704‘one who went forward’whoɨsa‘burn’manka ‘get fat’→ɨsa-ka-u [ɨ ́saku]‘what/who burned’→manka-ra-u [maŋkáru]‘one who got fat’mina‘soften, melt’ →mina-ra-u [mi ́naru]‘what became softened or melted’kau‘rot’kau-ra-u [kouróo]‘rotten meat’→From the above examples, it can be seen that while there is some overlap
between Set II -u and Set I -inu (§15.4.1) (for instance, the grammatical realization of
the semantic role of the participants they denote is the subject of the nominalized verb),
there are also some di$erences. The most notable di$erence is the ability of Set II -u to
attach to aspectual stems, either imperfective or perfective. This allows Set II -u
nominalizations to be able to actualize interpretations of the action of the nominalized
verb in a scale of time (via the aspectual construal). Compare:
(22)
a. kana-u
sleep+IPFV-NMLZ
‘one who sleeps’ or ‘one who is sleeping’b. kana-ka-u
sleep.PFV-INTENS-NMLZ
‘one who slept’c. kanu-inu
sleep-NMLZ
‘sleeper’705In (a) and (b), we can obtain interpretations of the nominalized verb as being
currently occurring or already occurred, respectively. By contrast, in (c) no such
interpretation(s) is/are possible, because the action of the nominalized verb is now a
property of the referent of the derived noun. This di$erence has important
consequences in the grammar: in Chapter XX, we will see that Set II nominalizers are
used primarily in modifying function (i.e. relative clauses), whereas Set I nominalizers
are used primarily in predicative functions.
15.4.6. Set II nominalizer -mau, ‘non-subject nominalizer’
Three main derivational properties are related to the su#x -mau: a) it creates a
noun that is understood as the patient or location of a verb; b) it creates a noun that is
understood as an action nominalizer; c) -mau also creates a stem to create locative
nominalizations, most frequently with the locative =nVma. To contrast -mau with the
other member of Set II, -u ‘subject nominalizer’, I use the term ‘non-subject nominalizer’
to refer to -mau. Historically, -mau likely developed from an old su#x *-ma plus the
nominalizer -u described in the preceding section. A likely source is the same morpheme
that is the modern the non-canonical switch-reference marker -ma ‘subject to object’
(see §19.10.1). Similarly to -u, -mau can attach to an aspectualized stem. Examples of706derivation with -mau are presented in (23).
(23)
nakuma ‘draw’→nakumɨ-a-mau ‘drawing (‘something that is being drawn’)(draw.IPFV-IPFV-NMLZ)
t͡sua ‘heal’→t͡sua-a-mau [t͡suwámu] ‘one that is healed’ (heal-IPFV-IPFV-→amu-ka-mau ‘""nished, exterminated’ (""nish-INTENS-IPFV-→nakuma-ka-mau [nakúmkamu] ‘drawing (something thatNMLZ)amu ‘""nish’
NMLZ)nakuma ‘draw’is already drawn’ (draw-INTENS-IPFV-NMLZ)
The nominalizer -mau also appears to derive nouns whose interpretation seems
to be that of an action nominalizer.
(24)
ha‘be sick’→ha-á-mau [haámu]‘death’ (be.sick-HIAF-NMZL)uutu ‘cry’→uutu-mau [uútmoo] ‘cry (N)’ɨmɨma ‘be proud’→ɨmɨma-mau [ɨmɨmamu] ‘pride’In relation to its ability to create action nominalizations, -mau is sometimes also
used to give a citation form of verbs.
The nominalizer -mau is also used to derived nouns that denote a location of the
action of the verb, cf. akiina ‘be born’ → akiina-mau [aki ́iɲamu] ‘birth’ or ‘place where
one is born’; arakama ‘plant (V)’ → arakama-a-mau [arákmamu] (plant-IPFV-IPFV-NMLZ)
‘what is planted (i.e. seeds, etc.)’ or ‘farm (sown ""eld)’. In most cases, however, -mau
needs to carry a locative marker to derive location nominalizations, most frequently -707mau occurs with the locative =nVma, as in shown (25).
(25)
puha ‘live+IPFV’ → puha-mau=nama [puhámunam] ‘where we live’
amu ‘""nish’ → amu-a-mau=nama [amúamunam] ‘where something the ends’, ‘end’
(""nish-IPFV-NMLZ=LOC)
The use of -mau in locative relativizations is described more in detail in §20.2.2
and §20.4
15.4.7. Negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau
The nominalizer -t͡ʃau can occurred attached to a root or aspectual stem. It
negates the element to which it attaches.
(26)
t͡ʃit͡ʃa‘speak’→t͡ʃit͡ʃa-t͡ʃau [t͡ʃi ́t͡ʃat͡ʃu] ‘quiet person’, ‘mute’kaka‘be strong’→kakait͡ʃau [kakɛ́it͡ʃu] ‘weak one’, ‘lazy one’nɨka‘know’→nɨkat͡ʃau [nɨkat͡ʃau]→surima-t͡ʃau [suri ́mt͡ʃoo]surima ‘be stingy’‘ignorant’ (‘one who does not know’)
‘generous person’The nominalizaer -t͡ʃau have developed from the negative verbal su#x -t͡ʃa and
Set II -u ‘agent nominalizer’. The nominalizer -t͡ʃau can also combine with adjectives,
other nouns and some adverbs, which indicates that formative -t͡ʃa in the nominalizer t͡ʃau is no longer analyzed by speakers as a verbal-only morpheme, hence -t͡ʃau is
analyzed as a synchronically unanalyzable morpheme.
15.4.8. Nominalizer -na
The nominalizer -na does not have a productive derivational function, but for
708sake of completeness it is described here. The nominalizer -na occurs with the potential
stem (formed with -mai), as shown in (27), and relativizing verbs after the person
marker, as shown in (28).

SINGLE VERB CONSTRUCTIONS WITH LEXICAL VERBS, AND
NOTES ON WORD ORDER AND ALIGNMENT
16.1. Introduction
Chapter XVI explores the syntactic constructions which involve only one lexical
verb as a main ""nite verb. The discussion begins with some notes on word order in
§16.2, followed by a description of the Wampis alignment pattern in §16.3, which
constitutes a typologically uncommon syntactic pattern. Next, §16.4 describes the
intransitive construction in Wampis. After a short note on copular constructions §16.5,
§16.6 and §16.7 describe the transitive and ditransitive construction in Wampis,
respectively. Finally, §16.8 and §16.9 describe the Wampis quotative and possession
constructions, respectively.
16.2. Notes on constituent order
In Wampis, the most basic verbal construction is a simple intransitive clause;
that is, an intransitive verb marked for aspect, tense, person, and mood. The verb can
stand alone to achieve a predication, not other constituent is needed.","[743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750]"

Jivaroan groups often have been described as one of the most aggressive and
dangerous groups in the Amazon. Very early reports during the 17th century speak of
their custom of cuting the heads of their enemies and making trophies of them, known
as tsantsa (/t͡sant͡sa/). As we have seen, during the 1800s and the ""rst decades of the
1900s, the Wampis were considered the scourge of the Marañon and Santiago, as they
often raided the small towns and settlements along these rivers.
By the end of the 19th century, western explorers and merchants started to trade
tsantsa to sell them in museums and private collections. The Jivaro quickly became the
focus of popular attention and the uncritical way outsiders took tsantsa contributed to
their characterization as infamous savages. The fact is that the practice of headshrinking—which involved a deep respect for the dead and a very strict ritual—was
quickly transformed into an exotic object of Western culture’s fascination. The
desacralization of the ritual tsantsa by westerners actually had a negative impact on
Jivaroan people: scholars have found that warfare among Jivaroan groups and the
death toll actually increased exponentially as trading tsantsa was encouraged by the
outside market (Ross 1988; Steel 1999).","[116, 117]"

THE VERB I: ""DERIVATIONAL"" LEVEL
13.1. Introduction
This chapter describes the ""rst level of morphology in the Wampis verb
structure, which roughly corresponds to “derivational” morphology, positions 1-5 in the
verb structure (cf. §12.7).
The categories to be studied in this chapter are the following:
1. Valence-adjusting morphemes, which are all su#xes, except for a causative
that is the only pre""x in the language (§13.2).
2. Object/Person markers (§13.2.4).
3. Aktionsart, Imperfective, Durative, Present habitual and Potential a#xes
(§13.3).
4. Negation (§13.4).
5. Non-imperfective plural (§13.5).
13.2. Valence operators
The ""rst layer of morphemes in the verbal piece, closest to the root, are valence
operators. Languages almost always exhibit several morphemes that serve to adjust the
566syntactic valence of clauses, increasing or decreasing it (Bybee 1985). In Wampis, a
number of morphemes serve the purpose of increasing or decreasing valence. Valencedecreasing and valence-increasing operators are su#xal, with the exception of a pre""xal
causative. Notice that there is no true passive in Wampis.
13.2.1. Valence-decreasing morphology
Wampis possesses a subset of morphemes that decrease the valence of a verb, as
shown in Table 13.1.","[604, 605, 606, 607]"
"282Frequency (Hz)5000lexicalmetrical000.7233
Time (s)jaíntáFigure 6.12. Spectrogram with pitch track for [jɛintá] ‘Help her/him!’6.7. Summary of stress and tone
It seems evident from all the previous discussion that the prosodic system of
Wampis does not really ""t well in the so-called category of “pitch accent”: stress in
Wampis is not only realized via high pitch (i.e. high tone)—this is a traditional
de""nition of “accent” (one high pitch per word); rather stress in Wampis is a mix of
articulatory cues related to vowel and consonant lengthening in addition to high pitch;
283stress is also manifested in the vowel elision patterns described in the preceding
sections. On the other hand, I have shown that in Wampis there can be more than one
phonetic realization of high tone in a word; what is more, some roots, a#xes and clitics
of di$erent nature (verbal, nominal, etc) have a lexically-speci""ed high tone. Lexicallyspeci""ed high tone disregards the stress pattern of the language. In addition to that,
high tone has functional load in the language, as it marks case. So, in light of the facts
just mentioned, how “pitch-accent” is Wampis? I argue that an answer to that question
is circular in principle, because we would have to start by giving a very ad-hoc
de""nition of “pitch-accent”, which would not ""t any well known cross-linguistic
prototype. The present attempt at analyzing Wampis prosody, on the other hand, shows
that Wampis can be analyzed in terms of two very well known prototypes of prosodic
system: stress and tone. Wampis is not a prototypical stress language nor is it a
prototypical tone language, it has features of both ends of the continuum.
6.8. The prosodic word
From the discussion above, the minimal prosodic word in Wampis is de""ned as a
word with at least two moras (i.e. two TBU), one high tone, one foot and one primary
stress. The requirement to have at least one high tone per prosodic word in Wampis is284achieved by metrical rules or by lexically specifying the high tone.
Wampis codas have an interesting behavior in the sense that they are apparently
weightless for the minimal word restriction (i.e. only vowels=TBUs are relevant). This
is important for the current analysis, as the stress pattern is centered around the tone
bearing unit (i.e. vowels).
There are some processes of cliticization where the copula and a demonstrative
occur together (in this way the demonstrative relativizes the copula), as in (55). The
copula itself can become cliticized to another word when relativized by a
demonstrative, as in (56). These constitute interesting cases where the grammatical
word and the prosodic word do not match.

6.9.1. Declarative intonation contour
Generally, declarative sentences show a decrease in pitch at the end of the
utterance. This decreasing in pitch usually is not dramatically deep—I have only rarely
found strong falling contours at the end of utterances, except of course when there is a
relatively long pause after the utterance. In this occasion, the last syllable may actually
show a deep falling contour and the vowels are pronounced very short and with low
intensity. Figure 6.13 shows an instance with a sentence that was uttered as an
introduction to a story, therefore there was a long pause before the story began. The
sentence is [húu óuhmattɛɛ̃ŋka aúhu tutɛiɲɛiti] ‘this is story is called Auhu’. Note in
particular the last sequence of the utterance ([ti]), which can be barely seen in the
spectrogram (it is indicated with an arrow). There is also a creaky voice in the
transition between the words [óuhmattɛɛ̃ŋka] and [aúhu]. Whether creaky voice is a
regular phenomenon in the prosody of words or not remains to be examined more
carefully.","[322, 323, 324, 325, 326]"
"297marking that agrees with the grammatical person of the verb present in the clause.
It is shown in this chapter that Wampis has a number of items that clearly are
a#xes and some other forms that are clearly independent words (e.g. nouns). In
addition, Wampis possesses clitics, including postpositional forms that operate at the
level of the phrase and are phonologically dependent on a host. One of the salient
features of Wampis is the copious morphology with which a word can occur, which is
sometimes “obscured” by the pervasive processes of vowel elision. The language has
many a#xes (mostly su#xes) as well as a good number of clitics, so long words
standing as utterances are not infrequent. Here is only an example of the beautiful and
complex ways in which the morphology of the language works to create long
expressions in Wampis:
(1) t͡ʃit͡ʃámrumɛint͡ʃouwɛithʲɛi
t͡ʃit͡ʃa-ma-ru-mai-inu-t͡ʃau=aita-ha-i
speak-REFL-APPL-POT-NMLZ-NEG.NMLZ=COP-1SG.SBJ-DECL
‘I cannot advice [him]’ (Lit: ‘I cannot be a speaker myself for him’).
7.3. Root, stem and word
There is a long tradition in linguistics to recognize di$erent elements within
words. For instance, within the American structuralist tradition, Bloom""eld (1933)
recognized the importance of distinguishing between roots and other a#xes.","[337, 338]"
"405The following example is part of an enumeration of beings and entities related to
Wampis worldview. The tihai are tall human-like beings that live in the jungle.
(118) tihɛ́ɛ wɨ ́antuʃa áwɛɛ
tihai uɨ ́antu=ʃaawaitihai group=ADDexist-3.SBJ-DECl‘There are the Tijai (i.e. as a group) also.’
The next example was translated into Spanish as <sachamango y sus
variedades> ‘sachamango (Gustavia subperba) and its varieties’:
(119) apɛ́i wɨ ́antun arákmakuiti
apaiuɨ ́antu=naarakama-ka-u=itisachamangogroup=ACCplant-INTENS-NMLZ=COP.3+DECL‘She planted sachamango and its varieties.’In a way, the word uɨ ́antu could be considered a derivational-like item, because
it changes the meaning of the noun. On the other hand, it could be considered an
in/ectional-like item because it adds a sense of plurality. Unlike other Wampis
derivational or in/ectional categories, however, uɨ ́antu is not an a#x. Semantically,
uɨ ́antu does not ""t into the prototype of other word classes such as adjectives, adverbs
or other noun modi""ers: it does not have attributive function like adjectives, it does not
add manner or other type of circumstantial information like adverbs, it does not have
deictic or pronominal functions like pro-words or demonstratives, and it does not have406a referential function like nouns. Syntactically, unlike other noun modi""ers, uɨ ́antu
always comes after the noun it modi""es. In addition, uɨ ́antu does not agree with the
noun when there is a demonstrative in the NP (unlike nouns and adjectives, see §8.3.1).
The source of this word could be related to an old root *uɨã. The word uɨa in current
Wampis means ‘father in law’, which does not seem semantically relatable to the idea of
‘group’. However, apparently in Achuar-Shiwiar the form <wea> (/uɨa/) means
‘relative’ (Fast et al. 1996: 322), in Shuar the form <weat> (/uɨatu/?) means ‘ancestor’
(Pellizaro & Náwech 2005: 489) and in Awajun <wɨ ̃gã> (/uɨ ̃ã/) means also ‘ancestor’
(Uwarai Yagkug et al. 1998: 53). It may be the case that the idea of group is a semantic
extension of a derivation of *uɨã ‘ancestor’. In the Wampis vocabulary by Jakway et al.
the entry <nu weantu> is given with the meaning ‘descendant’ (but there is no single
entry for <weantu>) (1987: 69).
8.10. Conjunctions
Conjunctions are words that are used to connect phrases and clauses. There is
actually little basis to claim that there are true conjunctions as a word class in Wampis.
On the other hand, the language makes plentiful use of hypotactic strategies for
connecting clauses. I de""ne “conjoining” in terms of coordination: two clauses (and in407the case of tura also phrases) that are not syntactically dependent one on another. In
other words, conjunctions join two or more elements of the same rank. At the intersentential level, conjunctions join independent verbs which can otherwise stand alone
as an assertion (Longacre 1970; Longacre 2007). Table 8.19 lists the words that assume
a conjoining function.","[445, 446, 447, 448]"
"It is not always easy to distinguish between “derivational” and “in/ectional”
morphology. Traditionally, in/ection is understood as a process that creates new forms
of a same lexical item, a form that is required by the syntactic environment where the
root appears. On the other hand, derivation is understood as the process of creating new
in/ectable items, usually to indicate new concepts (Hockett 1958; Gleason 1961).
However, in many cases it is better to speak of morphological formatives that are
capable of both derivational and in/ectional functions (Bybee 1985; Payne 1985).
Categories that are traditionally considered as in/ectional, such as “aspect”, “number”
or “negation”, for instance, possess also derivational properties in Wampis. At least
“aspect” is required in Wampis in all cases where a fully in/ected verb needs to be used,548and number and negation are of course required by certain syntactic constructions or
the verb cannot be integrated into the discourse. But most of these su#xes have
derivational properties. For instance, the root hapi ‘drag, pull’ usually forms a perfective
stem with the aktionsart su#x -ka ‘intensive (action of A/S)’206 and a durative stem with
the aspectual su#x -ma ‘durative’. This su#xes occupy the same position (cf. Table
12.5) and cannot co-occur together:

pull’ with a new meaning:
(19) hapi ‘drag’ > hapi-ma ‘sweep’This new stem is treated just as a root, and can receive verbal morphology as
any normal root would, including aktionsart su#xes (even though the durative is206. The relation between perfective and aktionsart su#xes is examined in the next Chapter; cf.
§13.3.","[588, 589]"

Intensi""ers provide the idea of an increase in intensity of the meaning of verbs,
adjectives or other adverbs. Being able to modify di$erent parts of speech, intensi""ers
are probably the most versatile adverbs. The intensi""ers iurata and hɨɨpata (apparently
there is no di$erence in meaning) have the interesting property of occurring in
constructions in which the verb is formally negated, even though the predication has a
positive meaning:

I have found also some examples of the form -rama to mark the plural

(cf. §13.2.4). The next example illustrate the use of -rama to form a plural imperative:
(51) juátarma
iu-á-tá-rama
eat-HIAF-IMP-2PL
‘(You PL) Eat!’673Many commands make use of the attenuative -sa. In fact, a typicall use of the
attenuative is to diminish the force of a command:

di$erence between -tá and -kia. I was told, however, that -kia is used para salir del caso
‘to get out of a (not very important) situation’. Such explanation is true for some but not
all cases in the data.

sentence like (54) may be said when a child does not want to eat and the father or233. Notice that the surface realization of the verb ‘go’ (whose underlying form is /uɨ/) is [wi]
and not [wɨ]. So, apparently -kia can establish backward harmony with a vowel /ɨ/ of the stem.
Unfortunately, I have very few examples of -kia with a verb stem ending in /ɨ/, so for the
moment I cannot make a more general statement on this.","[712, 713, 714]"

INTRODUCTION TO MORPHOLOGY
7.1. Introduction
This brief chapter provides an overview of the types of morphological units
found in Wampis, including the discussion of certain issues that pertain to multiple
parts of speech. The discussion in this chapter gives the appropriate background for the
detailed analyzes of word classes and their properties presented in the upcoming
chapters.
This chapter has the following structure: §7.2 describes the morphological
pro""le of Wampis in typological terms. This is followed by a discussion about the levels
of the root, stem and word in Wampis in §7.3. §7.4 discusses relevant notions related to
word classes and roots. In §7.5, there is a brief discussion about clear a not-so-clear cut
boundaries between word classes. §7.6 presents types of morphemes according to their
bound or free nature. Next, §7.7 looks at processes of reduplication, that involve
copying complete or partial portions of words. §7.8 describes compound words. Finally,
§7.9 o$ers a brief discussion of particles and how they will be treated in the grammar.","[335, 336]"
"315aktionsart su#x is ""lling an morphosyntactic requisite for the verb to be used in
perfective sense):
(19) kaŋkɨ ́kɛi ̃
kankɨ-ka-i ̃
roll-INTENS-3.PFV
‘It just rolled.’
cf *kankɨ-i ‘roll-3.PFV’
But in imperfective environments, the aktionsart su#xes cannot occur:
(20) kaŋkɨ ́awɛi
kankɨ-a-ua-i
roll-IPFV-3.SBJ-DECL
‘It is rolling’
cf. *kankɨ-ka-a-ua-i ‘roll-INTENS-IPFV-3.SBJ-DECL’
So it seems that aktionsart su#xes, apart from a derivational function, have a
more grammatical function akin to in/ection, in the sense that they are obligatory in
certain morphosyntactic environments, or otherwise the expression is agramatical. In
turn, aktionsart su#xes are in complementary distribution for instance with the
imperfective su#x, and their co-occurrence is prohibited.
From the preceding discussion, it can be seen that some morphemes in Wampis
(of which the aktionsart su#xes provide an illustration) pose problems with regard to
their classi""cation as either derivational or in/ectional. Table 7.5 summarizes the
behavior of the aktionsart su#xes with regards to some features that are traditionally316associated with canonical behavior of in/ectional and derivational su#xes (based on
Doris L. Payne (1985) and Haspelmath (2002))Table 7.5. Canonical in/ection and derivational properties with relation to aktionsart

Bybee (1985)). While I will try to characterize morphemes by
referring to their derivational or in/ectional properties, it must be borne in mind that
certain elements simply may be used as both derivational and in/ectional in certain
contexts.
In relation with the above idea, an important note to be considered is that in
Wampis there is a good number of nominalization processes that partake in the
grammatical structure of clauses. What is more, grammatical nominalizations have a
signi""cant role in the grammar of Wampis. Some forms that can be considered the
output of “derivational” processes have acquired grammatical status in modern Wampis.
For instance, the nominalizer -u can derive agentive nouns from a verb stem:
(21) nɨkóu
nɨka-u
know+IPFV-NMLZ
‘wise person’ (‘someone who knows’)
The same nominalizer occurs in a (historically) complex past tense where it
occurs in combination with the habitual past =hak:
(22) wampi ́shɛɛ̃ awarúnhɛɛ̃ mãan
́ ihakaru
uampisa=hai ̃ auaruni=hai ̃ mãa-́ nai=hak-ara-u
Wampis=COM Awajun=COM kill-HIAF-RECP=HAB.PT-PL-NMLZ
‘The Wampis and Awajun used to ""ght’3187.6.2. Clitics
Clitics attach to a host and form a phonological word with it. Several
phonological, morphological and syntactic parameters have been proposed for de""ning
clitics, and for di$erentiating them from a#xes (Zwicky 1977; Zwicky & Pullum 1983;
Aikhenvald 2003; Anderson 2005; Schiering 2006). Within this work, a clitic is de""ned
as a grammatically independent but phonologically bound morpheme that functions at
the level of the phrase. As opposed to a#xes, clitics do not operate only over single
words. As opposed to particles, which can occur on their own, clitics do not
phonologically occur on their own, although cross-linguistically it is common that clitics
have free-standing counterparts, especially clitics historically derived from pronouns.
Clitics do not constitute a single word class in Wampis in terms of prototypes,
morphological distribution, grammatical function or semantics—they are, at most, a
phonological class of items. However, for sake of completeness, they are mention in this
section, as they are bound morphemes. Table 7.6 lists morphemes analyzed as clitics
within this dissertation, with a cross-reference to the sections of the grammar where
they are analyzed.","[355, 356, 357, 358, 359]"
"46was good/grammatical. However, I would always make an annotation that the form
was suggested by myself ""rst, and the validity of that form was always double check
with di$erent speakers for greater accuracy in the description of the speci""c form.
Elicitation was also used to ""ll gaps in my data, ""ll out paradigms and to probe aspects
of certain construction when necessary. By eliciting, I also found a few constructions
that were not present in the recorded texts.
In order to record good-quality data, particular recording equipment was used.
The basic equipment taken to the ""eld consisted of voice recorders (Marantz PMD660
for the 2008 and 2010 ""eld trips, Zoom H4N for 2013), a condenser lavalier
microphone (AudioTechnica AT831B), a head-mounted microphone (Shure SM10A-CN),
a hand/table microphone, and a semi-professional camera capable of recording high
de""nition videos (Panasonic DMC). Additional equipment used included studio monitor
headphones, a laptop computer, an external hard-drive, notebooks, and an assortment
of other devices (memories, dvd disks, cables, etc.). During the trips, the equipment was
put in waterproof cases; some equipment, like the external hard drive, were chosen
because they were rain and fresh water resistant. Physical back-ups were constantly
made using the external hard-drive and other memory devices. Once in Lima, I also47backed-up the data using an on-line internet service.
An additional observation concerns the language via which I communicated
with Wampis people and into which the data was translated. My ""rst interactions with
the Wampis people were in Spanish, until I gradually became more con""dent in using
Wampis at least in basic communicative situations. Although I am a native speaker of
Spanish, I am aware that my variety is not the same as the regional Amazonian Spanish
or the Spanish spoken by the Wampis. Many younger Wampis generations (ages 15-40
years) are also more or less /uent in Spanish. Most male Wampis between the ages of
40 to 60 speak Spanish with di$erent degrees of /uency. The number of Wampis female
speakers who can speak Spanish in this age range vary, as not all of them had access to
education in the past. Elder female speakers are usually monolingual in Wampis and
know only a few basic phrases in Spanish. Elder male speakers' knowledge of Spanish
varies depending on whether they had access to primary or in few cases secondary
school. Young children (ages 0 to 5) usually do not learn Spanish until they start school
(though they are exposed to some Spanish, especially from radio shows). Thus,
Amazonian Spanish and Wampis language interact: the Spanish acquired by the Wampis
is Amazonian but with a Wampis substrate. This Amazonian Spanish with a Wampis48substrate is the variety that was used for translations in most cases (one of my Wampis
teacher masters the Spanish spoken in the Coast of Peru, in Lima—where she attended
classes at a local university—, which is my own variety of Spanish).
Especially during my ""eldwork in 2013, my teachers and co-workers often
helped me ask questions or explain the tasks in Wampis to other Wampis speakers. They
also acted as interlocutors to make speakers feel more comfortable and generally to set
a more natural environment. When I was the only interlocutor, I tried to interact with
interviewee(s) in Wampis so that they did not feel they were in an “arti""cial” setting. In
general, I tried to establish a recording setting in which the speaker would speak to an
interlocutor and not to a microphone. Even in cases where I myself did not use Wampis
properly, I managed to create a more comfortable atmosphere to work and people felt
more compelled to expand their role to supplement information and teach me how to
say in Wampis what I wanted to communicate. This, in turn, opened additional
opportunities to ask more questions about the language. However, in cases when I was
not able to convey my thoughts using Wampis and felt communication was broken, I
resorted to Spanish to try to maximize understanding of the task at hand.
Transcription was done always with the help of my teachers, all of them native49speakers of Wampis. Literal and free translations of the texts were given in Spanish by
my Wampis teachers. As I grew con""dent in the Wampis language myself, I started to
propose translations of parts of the texts with the supervision (and not a few
corrections) of my teachers. This was done as a personal exercise to elicit data and to
gain a better understanding of the language rather than to actually translate texts—my
teachers’ translations were always considered to have authoritative status. I noticed that
most people were comfortable with the voice recorder and did not mind the lavalier
microphone, so these equipments were my ""rst choice for recording in most cases.
Recording of words and phrases for phonetic analysis was done mostly in the city of
Lima, where I could secure a quieter environment to work in.
The work/ow for processing the data was divided into several steps. After
recording in the ""eld, I backed up the data and asked the speaker(s) for a free
translation or explanation of the just-recorded text. Translations or explanations were
not always possible, as speakers would go around on their own errands, but when
speakers were available I would record or write down the translation or explanation
o$ered. Generally, I did not immediately transcribe the texts, but I invited the
interviewee to listen to the recording, provide a free translation if possible and talk with50me about the content. I always took notes during these occasions. In a few cases,
explanations were given in Spanish. At this time, I also wrote down notes about
grammar structures or interesting language use that I captured while re-listening to the
recording two or three times. Finally, I took note of phrases that speakers felt needed to
be corrected because they considered they were “ungrammatical”, “did not sound
good”, or because there was an error of performance.
Transcription and rechecking of translations into Spanish usually happened in
Jaen and Lima with other Wampis speakers. This also proved to be a useful exercise to
double-check for possible errors. I used ELAN (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/),
a free transcribing and annotating software program, for transcriptions. In ELAN, I also
later translated the text into English. Then I exported the ELAN ""le into FLEx (http:/
/""eldworks.sil.org//ex/), a freely available software for language documentation and
analysis. The databases created in FLEx contain both a lexicon and an interlinearized
collection of texts. The interlinearized texts contain a practical orthography line, a
phonetic analysis, a morpheme-by-morpheme analysis, a literal translation in Spanish,
and free translations in Spanish and English, plus they include additional notes
explaining either grammatical or cultural points.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91]"
"421CHAPTER IX
ADJECTIVES
9.1. Introduction
This chapter analyzes the class of adjectives in Wampis. Adjectives constitute a
“semi-closed” class in Wampis. Approximately 40 items constitute the class of adjectives
in the language. Wampis possesses adjectivalizers, i.e. derivational morphology that
derives adjectives. However, adjective derivation is no longer as productive as it seems
to have been. In fact, one adjectivalizer is not very productive at all (the adjectivalizer rama, see §9.8.3) and the other is historically based on nominalization (§9.8.5). There is
one adjective-to-adjective derivational su#x that is productive but not very common (taku, see §9.8.2). It seems that the distinction between nouns and adjectives used to be
more prominent in past stages of the language, as the existence of adjective-derivational
morphemes would suggest.
The fact that there are not many adjectives and that adjective derivation is
apparently no longer common does not mean that the language lacks ways to modify
nouns. In fact, modern Wampis makes plentiful use of relativization to modify nouns,
whereas the adjectives that do exist are more frequently use in predicative function.
422Adjectives in Wampis are canonically post-nominal. Because of the cliticizing
nature of most case and adposition forms in Wampis, adjectives can host case (but not
all cases) and adpositions, which usually attach to the last element of the NP.
The structure of this chapter is as follows: §9.2 provides the basic criteria to
de""ne the adjective in Wampis, §9.3–§9.4 distinguish the category of adjectives from
verbs and nouns. This is follow by an analysis of the morphological properties of
adjectives in §9.5. Next, I describe the Adjective Phrase in §9.6, followed by the analysis
of syntactic operations associated with adjectives in §9.7. Derivation of adjectives in
dealt with in §9.8, whereas semantic and discoursive properties of adjectives are
described in §9.9–§9.10.
9.2. De!ning the adjective in Wampis
Adjectives are problematic to de""ne in many languages. There are languages
that do not have a clear adjective class; what is more, it is well established that property
concepts can be expressed by nouns, verbs or adjectives (Givón 1979: 14; Dixon 1982).
However, I will propose that adjectives are a distinct class in Wampis.
Croft (2001: 86 and $.) o$ers an analysis in terms of typological prototypes,
discussing PROPERTIES as halfway between what he terms conceptual OBJECTS and ACTIONS in423terms of relationality, stativity, transitoriness and gradability. In Croft’s terms, a
prototypical adjective is characterized by expressing a property and having a modifying
function. In Croft’s view, an Adjective is a language-speci""c category that corresponds
to the semantics of a PROPERTY, and modi""es an entity functioning as an OBJECT. Croft’s

8.11. Interjections
Interjections are “words that can constitute utterances in themselves, and that
usually have no syntactic connection to any other words that may co-occur with them”
(Schachter & Shopen 2007: 57). Interjections usually exhibit special phonological status,
and sometimes may disregard the language’s normal phonological principles and
restrictions. For instance mah ‘surprise’, ‘admiration’, does not have the two-mora
requisite of phonological words in Wampis. Morphologically, the particularity of
interjections is that they do not take any a#x or clitic. Syntactically, interjections
usually are not part of clauses, but they behave like a whole utterance on their own.
Table 8.20 provides a list of frequent interjections in the data.","[450, 451, 452]"
"[(Adv)(Subj)(Obj)(Obl)(Adv)V(Obl) ]Figure 16.1. Wampis simple lexical verb word orderThe basic constituent order in Wampis is predicate ""nal. In basic, pragmatically
unmarked declarative clauses, the word order is A P V, where A= most Agent-like
participant, P= most Patient-like participant, and V= Verb . However, the Wampis
language allows for other order of subjects and objects. Adverbs and Oblique arguments
are relatively free to occur before or after the predicate, but their preferred position in
terms of frequency is pre-verbal.
16.3. Alignment and grammatical relations
Grammatical relations concern the nature of the relationship between a
711predicate or a construction and its core arguments: the single argument of intransitive
constructions (S), the most agent-like argument (A) and the most patient-like arguments
of transitive constructions (Comrie 1978). Alignment has to do with the patterns by
which a language establishes the grammatical relations of those core arguments.
Alignment may be manifested in a variety of coding structures including contituent
order, participant-reference marking on verbs, case marking and various
morphosyntactic combinations thereof. The following discussion concerns the marking
of argument NPs in Wampis. The language exhibits also an uncommon pattern of
argument indexation on the verb, which was described in Chapter XIV.
Wampis exhibits a nominative-accusative alignment. S/A arguments are treated
di$erently from P. Importantly, Wampis distinguishes between subjects and nonsubjects, i.e. Wampis exhibits a symmetrical objects system (Bresnan & Moshi 1990).
The coding properties and syntactic behavior of objects in Wampis (notional direct and
indirect objects, objects of applicative) are identical.
In Wampis S/A as a category is relatively straightforward. S/A Noun Phrases are
treated in the same way at the syntax level. The marking of the subject (“Nominative”
case) is zero. Aspect, de""niteness, deixis or other category do not play any relevant role712in the marking of A/S NPs. The following examples illustrate the marking of the single
argument of an intransitive verb (S) for di$erent grammatical persons in (2)–(5), and
the marking of the Agent-like argument of a transitive verb (A) for di$erent
grammatical persons in (6)–(9).

English; so it is my task to make this work more accessible to non-English readers,
specially to the Wampis.
My friend’s message also reveals some pre-conceptions of people about
language. That one person suggests to another person that she has to learn her native
language (which she already orally speaks, and writes) is striking, and sad, to me. In the
best case scenario, the person at the Ministry of Education really wants to help but has
no clue about how to do it (note also that he may be confusing oral with written
language). The ideas 1) that one has to (re-)learn their own native language which they
already speak (in the case of my friend, Wampis); 2) that someone discourages the use
of my friend’s native language to express herself (in the case of my friend, via writing
literature in Wampis) left me very perplexed. There is much work to do in the ""eld of
intercultural education in Peru.
The Wampis are no exotic people. I consider it to be demagogic and very uncritical to treat them as victims or “subaltern subjects”. It is true that, through colonial
and independent times, the Wampis have su$ered many abuses, but they have defended
themselves too. Unlike many other native groups in the Americas, the Wampis culture875was never suppressed by the dominant colonial power, or by republican powers in
independent times—that combative spirit and sense of freedom has likely prevented the
extinction or total assimilation not only of the Wampis, but of the Jivaroan peoples in
general. The Wampis identity is centuries old, and dates back to pre-national Peruvian
times. Just like their language, the Wampis consider themselves subjects in a modern
culture, the Wampis culture, within the greater Peruvian national society. The Wampis
culture is not an immobile atavistic culture. It is very modern on its own way, and just
like the language, the Wampis culture is in constant adaptation. I ""nished Chapter II
with a quote by one of my Wampis teachers: “we no longer defend ourselves with
weapons, we defend ourselves with words”. It is perhaps no coincidence that one word
for ‘to defend’ in Wampis is based on the word t͡ʃit͡ʃama ‘word, speech’.296 Language and
communication are at the center of Wampis culture, and much of what I found in
Wampis discourse about how they conceive of themselves and their problems in current
times centers around being able to communicate their needs to others. As Óscar
Jimpikit, secretary of the Community of Candungos, puts it:297296. The reader will ""nd several instances of this word written as a stem <chicham> in the
examples below.

The Wampis people, just like any other group, want to be respected and be able
to negotiate policies and laws that may a$ect them. They do not want someone else to
take decisions in their name. I asked a Wampis leader, Juan Luis Nuningo, Apu (local
Chief) of the Community of Puerto Galilea, to record a text about current problems of
the Wampis, what they would like for future generations from his perspective. He
immediately construed a very interesting and wise speech, in which he considered a
good person (from a Wampis perspective) to be someone who knows the Wampis
language and culture as well as the national, mestizo culture (including Spanish, the
national language of Peru)—that is, the Wampis do not consider themselves an isolateddirect translations of the examples (and transcribe using the Wampis alphabet, not IPA symbols).

11.5.6. Plural speech act participant =tí
The Plural Speech Act participant enclitic =tí normally attaches to a noun

examples illustrate the use of this morpheme.

(76) i ́iɲiati
ii=ni ̃=ia=ti ́
1PL=LOC=ABL=SAP
‘one of us’The next example shows that the speech act participant morpheme works at the
level of the phrase. In (77) =ti ́ attaches to the last element of the complex conjoined
526NP. In the context of the text whence the example comes from, it has a scope over the
entire phrase: it means “we the Awajun and the Wampis”.
(77) awarún túra wampistí
awaruniturawampisa=tíAwajunandWampisa=SAP‘We the Awajun and the Wampis’When =tí occurs after the ablative, it creates a plural ethnonym. An extended
meaning of “among us” is also possible in this case:
(78) perunmajatík
Peru=nVma=ia=tí=kɨ
Peru=LOC=ABL=SAP=RESTR
‘We the people of Peru’ or ‘Among us Peruvians’
The Plural Speech Act participant =tí can derive a second person plural
participant in two ways in my data. First, it can attach to a noun followed by a second
person plural marker:
(79) ʃuartírmɨka
ʃuara=tí-rumɨ=ka
person=SAP-2PL=FOC
‘You (PL) the people’
The second way is by attaching directly to a copula that is marked with a plural
person su#x:
(80) ʃuár ɛ́ɛɲatiram
[ʃuara a-ina]=tí-ramɨ
person COP-PL.IPFV=SAP-2PL
‘You (PL) the people’
527This suggests that the construction [N cop-pl] used to pluralized nouns (see
§11.3.4) is likely being reanalyzed as a noun phrase, rather than as a verbal clause, as
=tí does not occur anywhere else in the data as a verbal enclitic or a deverbal
derivational morpheme. In addition, the fact that =ti ́ can receive person markers
suggest a possible verbal origin for this enclitic (possibly an old copula?). The same
reanalysis of the construction [N cop-pl] can also be observed when =tí also occurs
marked on the copula to derive a 1st person plural:
(81)
[huti a-ina]=tí
1PLCOP-PL.IPFV=SAP‘We’ (lit. ‘we who are-us’)Sometimes =ti ́ functions as a more inclusive pluralizer in combination with the
additive =ʃa. In the next example, the speaker creates a semantically complex subject
that includes elders and children. Thus, the sentence in (82) does not mean ‘we, we the
elders, we the children…’ but ‘we—the elders and children altogether…’.

11.5.7. First =á
As the name indicates=á adds a meaning of ‘""rst’ or, by extension, ‘before’ to
the element on which it occurs.
(83) wampistijá
uampisa=tí=á
Wampis=SAP=FIRST
‘We the Wampis ""rst’
First =á can provide a sentence with an idea of relative importance/priority:
(84) ɨnt͡sanamá wɨ ́mi
ɨnt͡sa=nama=áwɨ-miriver=LOC=FIRSTgo-HORT‘Let’s go to the river ""rst.’
The morpheme =á can also occur in pronouns. The semantic scope of =á in the
examples is over the clause:
(85) nijá wakóo ásã. . .
ni ̃=áua-ka-ua-sã3SG=FIRSTclimb.up-INTENS-NMLRCOP-SUB.3SG.SS‘(He) having climbed up ""rst…’
11.5.8. A&ective =á
The a$ective adds a meaning of sorrow for the entity (typically human) to which
the noun or pronoun which carries -ia refers.

prototypically used as attributes, and “action-roots” are prototypically used as
predicates. In (11), the “object-root” nua has a referential function (it refers to the
object ‘woman’), the “property-root” pɨ ́nkɨra has a modifying function (it modi""es
‘woman’), and the “action-root” uɨ has a predicating function (note it has to be in/ected

aunuapɨ ́nkɨra uɨ-a-ua-iDISTwoman goodgo-IPFV-3.SBJ-DECL‘That good woman is going.’Of course, in Wampis as in many other languages, not all nouns denote physical
objects (there can be abstract objects/concepts), not all verbs denote volitional actions,
and not all adjectives denote properties (or certain properties are not denoted by
adjectives). These terms refer to prototypes of each major category. Understanding
grammatical categories in terms of prototypes allows us to choose key lexemes to start
305checking the morphosyntax of a language. This does not mean that I will pre-judge that
categories such as “verb” or “adjective” exist in Wampis a priori; rather, I take this
approach to grammatical categories as both methodologically helpful to establish
prototypical members of major classes and theoretically grounded in the study of
human cognition (Langacker 1976; Miller & Johnson-Laird 1976; Langacker 1987).
However, the grammatical categories of a language need to be determined by
morphosyntactic properties, to quote Croft: “categories in a particular language are
de""ned by the constructions of the language” (Croft 2001: 85). In that regard, word
classes often cannot be equated across languages. Grammatical categories de""ned for
di$erent languages depend on language-speci""c criteria (Croft 1984; Lazard 1992; Croft
2001; Dryer 2006; Haspelmath 2007).
Accordingly, in the next chapters, for each major word class, I will present a
discussion in terms of their prototypical members, but I will also provide the relevant
morphosyntactic evidence that have helped de""ned such categories in Wampis. As an
example, we have just seen that the concepts of ‘woman’ and ‘good’ have the
prototypical functions of object reference and property modi""cation, respectively. There
is no special morphology associated with these prototypical functions, as shown in (11)306before. However, when ‘woman’ or ‘good’ occur in predicative function, they occur in a
di$erent construction. In other words, when they are used in a function that is di$erent
from their prototypical one, it is “marked” somehow by the language. In this speci""c
case, a copular construction occurs to allow nouns and adjectives to function
predicatively:
(12) óu núwɛiti
aunua=itiDISTwoman=COP.3+DECL‘That is a woman.’(13) óu pɨ ́ŋkɨrɛiti
aupɨ ́nkɨra=aitiDISTgood=COP.3+DECL‘That is good.’
Thus, the fact that nouns and adjectives need to be morphosyntactically treated
to become “similar” to verbs (by adding a copula) to be used predicatively, provides a
""rst piece of evidence for stating that there is a basic di$erence between verbs, and
nouns and adjectives in Wampis (a verb does not need a copula to be used
predicatively). Detailed evidence with plenty of examples will be presented in the
respective chapters where I de""ne the Adjective (Chapter IX), the Noun (Chapter X) and
the Verb (Chapter XII) in Wampis. In addition, Wampis also possesses minor classes,307which are analyzed in Chapter VIII (I include an analysis of Adverbs in this chapter, see
§8.6).
7.5. Fuzzy boundaries and clear-cut boundaries
As often happens in languages around the world, the boundaries between certain
categories are sometimes untidy in Wampis. For instance, nat͡sa ‘single (a person
without a partner)’ can be used referentially, but it can also be used attributively, in
which case it means ‘young’. The same root is used in the verb nat͡sa-ma ‘be timid, be
embarrassed’, although in this case it carries the verbalizer -ma (see §12.6.2). Table 7.2
provides a sample of roots that exhibit “untidy” boundaries, i.e. roots which can be used
in more than one way (referentially, attributively or predicatively) without marking the
root with special (i.e. derivational) morphology. Examples like the ones given in Table
7.2 actually do not abound in Wampis. In fact, at least with reference to the two crosslinguistically major categories of word classes, nouns and verbs, ambiguous or labile
categoriality is usually not an issue in Wampis. In this language, certain roots are
usually used predicatively and certain other roots referentially: there is not a lot of
cross-over or overlap. In more informal words, object-naming roots are not as freely
used in predicative function—or vice versa—unlike, for instance, in English.","[344, 345, 346, 347, 348]"
