{JA, TX 070}Words to which kaka is attached as a suffix have characteristics of verblike adjectives (cf.

‘It was a lot what I have told.’{JA, Jovina 161}The irrealis marker <a’> or -RED~-a’As described in 3.6.2, the irrealis infix <a’>, realized as <ka’> after a vowel, is inserted after
the first iambic foot of the base. It signals irrealis mood in affirmative contexts and participant
negation in negative contexts. As an irrealis marker, it indicates that the speaker considers it
unimportant when exactly the event takes place, but assures that it will take place eventually.
Consider the following examples of the irrealis marker on monovalent verbs:
(55)sal<a’>mo

{EA, Makina 013}Since the irrealis marker has a future implication, it is often combined with the TAM-particles
nokowa and loy (cf. 12.2.4 and 12.3.2, respectively):

‘I’ll do it [when I find the time].’{EA 12, 142a}When the verb is preceded by the negative particle kas, the irrealis infix functions as a marker
of existential negation: it negates the existence of the primary participant, i.e. the one encoded
by the absolutive argument. This is identical to its negative function on predicate nominals
(cf. 7.15.1).

NEG again sit-IRR-DR
‘I don’t have a house, you know.’ [lit.: “There is nowhere for me to sit.”]
{EA, Mi casa 014}As with predicate nominals negated by the irrealis marker (cf. 7.15.1), a periphrasic
construction with a demonstrative predicate can be used as an alternative. This is shown by
(64)b as opposed to a, which contains the irrealis marker.

then usually apparent from the context. In this case, the irrealis marker implies negation. The
following are examples from a dialogue:

hurt-IRR-PRC
‘[They] don’t feel pain.’ [lit: “Nothing hurts.”]{AH, Dial. EA&AH 023}Strikingly, the irrealis marker negates the existence of the participant established by the voice
properties of the base (cf. 8.1). Compare, for example, the irrealis forms in (65)–(66) above
with the corresponding unmarked forms in (68)–(70), respectively. These take an absolutive
argument:
(68)salmo-kwa:-na--sne
return-BEN-DR--f.a
‘I return for her.’ [i.e., for her benefit](69)suy-kay-a=sne--kus
deprive-INV-LV=f.a--m.a.OBV
‘He takes (it) away from her.’(70)tivij-ni--a
pain-PRC--n
‘It hurts.’In a negative clause, a predicate that contains the irrealis marker cannot cooccur with a
pronoun or NP that refers to the participant whose existence is negated. In an affirmative
clause, in contrast, a predicate that contains the irrealis marker can cooccur with the
absolutive argument. Hence, in addition to the presence or absence of the negative particle
kas, the realization of the absolutive argument formally identifies an irrealis-marked verb as
an affirmative predicate. Compare the negative irrealis clause, marked by kas, in (71)a with
the affirmative clause, containing a pronoun that encodes the absolutive argument, in (71)b:440(71)a. kas rey deja<la:~>l-a’

overtly expressed, their absence is not an unmistakable signal of either the affirmative or the
negative interpretation. The following expression, for example, has two possible
interpretations, depending on the context:
(72)dewaj-a’-na
see-IRR-DR
‘I don’t see anything.’ ~ ‘I’ll see X (sometime).’Morphologically, the irrealis marker behaves slightly differently on verbs with monovalent
and middle roots (cf. 8.3.2 and 8.3.3, respectively). This may have to do with their inherent
valency, but it can also be a purely morphological phenomenon. When the irrealis marker is
attached to verbs with monovalent or middle roots, the voice affix, which is normally attached
to the root, is lost. This is to say, monovalent verbs lose the reflexive/reciprocal marker -che ,
which indicates agentivity of the participant (cf. 8.1.4, 8.3.2), and verbs with middle roots
lose the middle reduplication (cf. 8.3.3). Since only a single iambic element remains, the
irrealis marker is attached as a suffix and then reduplicated (cf. 3.6.2). In (57) and (71) above,
examples of verbs with middle roots were given, which would have the form kay~kay ‘to eat’
(cf. (57)) and de<ja:~>jal ‘to cook’ (cf. (71)) if not marked as irrealis. The following
examples are of irrealis-marked verbs with a monovalent root, which take the
reflexive/reciprocal suffix -che when not marked as irrealis. The verb in jo<ya:~>y-a’ in
(73) would appear as joy-che ‘go’ if not marked as irrealis; the verb de<ka:~>-ka’ in (74)
would appear as de:-che ‘lie’. An example involving the verb en-che ‘to stand’ was seen in
(64) above.

"54212.5.1. kas: main clause negation
The particle kas forms a negative clause (cf. 7.15.1). At the same time, the predicate is
morphologically modified. In the canonical negative clause, this is achieved with action
nominalization through -wa when the predicate is a verb or through infixing reduplication
when the predicate is a morphological noun (cf. 11.1.1):

‘(It was) a bright night, it wasn’t dark.’{EA, Escape 050}When the predicate in the negative clause already contains a negative affix, it is not
additionally nominalized. In (223) and (224), the predicate contains the irrealis infix <a’> (cf.
10.3). The predicate in (225) contains the mental-state suffix -baycho, which typically has a
negative meaning (cf. 10.5).

PRO.1sg NEG here-PRC-MST
‘I don’t want to be here anymore.’{EA, Cbba 035}The negative particle kas is special in that it resembles very much the neuter article. First of
all, it has similar syntactic properties: kas precedes a predicate which is nominalized, in the
same way in which the neuter article precedes a nominalized predicate in subordinate clauses,
shown in (226) and (227):
(226)bo

pa<ya~>yak-a=as
obl-ART.n.p dark<NMZ.N~>-LV=n.a
‘when it is dark’543Morphologically, the negative particle and the neuter article are similar as well. First of all,
both occur before action nouns (cf. 11.1.1):
(228)a. kas
chi:-wa=a
NEG go_out-NMZ=n
‘It doesn’t come/go out.’b. as
chi:-wa=a
ART.n go_out-NMZ=n
‘its coming/going out’Second, not only the article, but also the negative particle is phonologically conflated with the
first-person marker (cf. 4.4):
(229)a. ka
chi:-wa
NEG.1 go_out-NMZ
‘I don’t come/go out.’b. a
chi:-wa
ART.n.1 go_out-NMZ
‘my coming/going out’This morphological parallel with the article suggests that the final element s of the negative
particle is the same determining element that occurs on the article and on demonstratives,
described in 3.9.3 and 4.4.
A third parallel between the negative particle and the article concerns the form of this
particle, kas, and the organization of the article paradigm (cf. 4.4). Recall from 4.4 that the
absential article is always contains an initial k; for example, the presential masculine article is
us, and the absential masculine article is kus. The absential neuter article, kos, is irregular in
that it is not only marked by k, but also has a different vowel than the presential neuter article,
as. The form that would be expected to represent the absential neuter article is kas. However,
the morpheme kas functions as the negative particle. Historically, therefore, it is possible that
the negative particle originates from the article paradigm, and that the change *kas > kos
resulted from the need to differentiate between negation and the article.
Note that there are several particles that are morphologically and semantically related to the
negative particle kas: the negative expression ka:’i ‘no’, which is often used in the same way
as kas; the preclusive particle ka: (cf. 12.5.5); and the prohibitive particle ka’ (cf. 12.5.4).12.5.2. loy negation of subordinate and relative clauses
The function of the negative particle loy, not to be confused with the homophonous modal
particle loy ‘intentional’ (cf. 12.3.2 above), was already described in 7.15.2. It negates relative
and subordinate clauses. In relative clauses, loy goes together with partial action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.2). This is to say, in negative relative clauses, only monovalent
predicates are converted into action nouns, which are non-relational. In subordinate clauses,
in contrast, the particle loy has no effect on the form of the subordinate predicate.
Examples (230) and (231) show loy in a relative clause with a bivalent and with a
monovalent predicate, respectively. Note that the bivalent predicate in (230) is not
nominalized, whereas the monovalent predicate in (231), which is a noun, receives the suffix
- e (cf. 11.1):544(230)koro’ kos

the article and action nominalization. Note that the predicate, whether monovalent, as in
(232), or bivalent, as in (233), occurs in the same form that it would have if the clause were
affirmative. In (232), the predicate is a canonical action nominal formed by the suffix -wa (cf.
11.1.1). In (233) and (234), the predicate contains the the nominalizing suffix -na that is
required by the subordinating particle jan ‘CSQ’ (cf. 11.1.3).

The particle mo: ‘not yet’ occurs right before the predicate. It indicates that the event has not
occurred at the time of reference, but will, or is expected to, occur later. The time of reference
can be the time of speaking or the time of the narrative context. In (235), the time of reference
is the time of speaking:

second ocurrence, which represents part of a comment made by the narrator, refers to the time
of narrative context, in this case the day before the events are narrated:

‘When we first had a field, I didn’t have any children yet.’
{EA, Chaco III 001}The particle mo: triggers partial nominalization (cf. 11.1.2). When the predicate of the
subordinate clause introduced by mo: is monovalent, as in (236), it is converted into a nonrelational noun through the suffixation of -wa or, if it is a noun, through reduplication (cf.
(237)). When the predicate of the subordinate clause is bivalent, however, it remains
unmodified, as illustrated in (238):
(238)aya-ti
bo
mo: lirij-na=‘ne
wait.DR-IMP.tr REAS
yet shake-DR=f
‘Wait because she hasn’t shaken [the tablecloth] yet.’{EA 19, 146g}Note that partial nominalization of the predicate (cf. 11.1.2) not only occurs with mo: ‘not
yet’, but also with the negative particles loy ‘NEG’ in relative clauses (cf. 12.5.2 above) and
ka’ ‘prohibitive’ (cf. 12.5.4 below).12.5.4. ka’ ‘prohibitive’
The particle ka’ marks the prohibitive construction. It has the same formal properties as mo:
‘not yet’, described above. When the predicate is monovalent, it is nominalized, and when
bivalent, it is not. In (239)–(241), the construction is shown with monovalent, nominalized
predicates:

"Negation7.15.1. Main clause negation: kas + NMZ
In a negative main clause, the predicate is preceded by the negative particle kas (cf. 12.5.1).
At the same time, the predicate either contains a negative element, or it is converted into a
relational noun by action nominalization (cf. 11.1). The latter form is identical to that of verbs
in subordinate clauses (cf. 7.12).
The following are examples of negative clauses with verbal predicates. Example (256)
illustrates a negative intransitive, (257) a negative transitive direct, and (258) a negative
transitive inverse clause. Note that in all cases, the deverbal noun is possessed. This is to say,
the intransitive argument and ARG1 is attached as an internal clitic or, in the case of the first
person singular (cf. (258)), it is implied. Hence, in negative main clauses, we find the same
reversed ergativity split as described for subordinate clauses in 7.12 above.

{EA, Cbba 158f.}A free pronoun in clause-initial position is negated by first attaching the verbalizing suffix -ni,
and subsequently nominalizing it by the verbal nominalizing suffix -wa. This type of
nominalization creates an unpossessed noun (cf. 11.9.4).

morphologically similar, there is an interesting parallel. Both the formation of the affirmative predicate by
prefixing reduplication (cf. 7.9.5) and that of the negative predicate by infixation of the irrealis marker are
applied according to the first iambic foot of the word (cf. 3.6.2, 3.7.6).","[339, 340, 341]"

While it is sometimes difficult to isolate the meaning of the root in these verbs, it is clearly
the case that predicates with -baycho in affirmative contexts denote some kind of mental state
or psychological property. This can be seen in (107) and (108) above, as well as in (110)–

are also worth mentioning. These are pabaycho ‘think’ (cf. (113)) and to’baycho ‘remember’

combined with other morphemes.

these cases can be considered identical to -baycho in negative contexts, where it also indicates
a (more specific) state of mind.
Note, however, that there is one formal difference between predicates containing -baycho in
affirmative and in negative clauses. In affirmative use, the suffix -baycho creates a predicate
whose argument is absolutive, as expected of monovalent predicates. This could be seen, for
example, in (108) and (114), where the first person singular is encoded by the bound pronoun
of Set 2, in.247 In contrast, in negative contexts, the derived predicate has an internally
cliticized argument (cf. (101)–(106)). No explanation for this contrast in person encoding can
be given at this point.","[469, 470, 471, 472]"
"7.5.3. The ergativity split in affirmative main clauses
The hierarchical alignment system in Movima creates a split-ergative pattern. This becomes
apparent when an intransitive clause is compared with the direct and the inverse construction,
respectively. In both the direct and the inverse pattern, ARG2 has the same formal properties
as ARGintr, as was described in 7.2 above. As far as affirmative main clauses are concerned,
when the intransitive construction is compared with the direct transitive construction, this
results in an ergative pattern, since ARG2 is the most patient-like participant (the undergoer).
When it is compared with the inverse construction, in contrast, we see an accusative
alignment pattern, since ARG2 is the most agent-like participant (the actor).162 This is
schematized in Table 23:
Table 23. The ergativity split in affirmative main clauses163
ARG1
–absolutive
Stransitive directAUtransitive inverseUAintransitive161The passive translation of (96) reflects the topicality of ARG1.
For the different pattern of subordinate and negative clauses, see 7.12 and 7.15, respectively.
163
The abbreviations in the table are: S=only argument of intransitive clause, A=actor, U=undergoer.
162280It has to be emphasized, however, that the distinctions between ARG1 and ARG2 are not case
distinctions. They do not serve to indicate the grammatical relations of the arguments, but are
semantically determined, while the semantic roles of the arguments are exclusively indicated
by verbal markers. The apparent ergativity split is only a side-effect of this system.","[303, 304]"

well as on labile roots, which oscillate between mono- and bivalent roots (cf. 8.3.4), the suffix
-ka can equally add the immediative or the impossibilitive meaning. The impossibilitive, if
not apparent from the context, is then indicated by the presence of the particle kas. The
following examples illustrate this for the middle root am- ‘bathe’. In (19)a, the suffix -ka has
the immediative function, since there is no indication of a negative context. In (19)b, the
negative particle kas marks the clause as negative, so that the suffix -ka is interpreted as
indicating the impossibility of the event.

‘It is unreadable.’ [putting aside the book]{JM 19, 028}On labile roots, the attachment of -ka has the same effect as on middle roots. In an
affirmative context, the root is interpreted as monovalent, and -ka adds the meaning
“immediately” (cf. (21)a); in a negative context, it is interpreted as bivalent (cf. (21)b):
(21)a. am-ka -a=as

-nira ‘potential’, which is described in the next section.10.1.4. -nira ‘potential’
The suffix -nira is rare. It seems to be composed of the verbalizing suffix -ni and the
semantically empty bound nominal element -ra ‘BE.ntr’. The resulting word is a
morphological noun. It indicates that the event denoted by the verb root has the potential to
occur. The following examples illustrate this suffix on a bivalent and a monovalent root,

Relative clauses and subordinate clauses that involve nominalization are negated differently
from main clauses. Instead of kas ‘NEG’, the negative particle here is loy ‘NEG.SUB’. The
subordinate predicate is only modified under certain circumstances, depending on the
construction and on its valency.
When the particle loy occurs in a transitive relative clause, the predicate remains
unmodified:
(272)jo’yaj kos
juyeni di’ loy
ona-ye-na=i
arrive ART.n.a person REL NEG.SUB know-BE.person-DR=pl
‘Some person arrives who they don’t know.’
{HR, TX 127}In an intransitive relative clause, the predicate is nominalized in the same way as a negated
main-clause predicate (cf. 7.15.1), as shown in (273). In contrast to negative main clauses,
however, the nominalized form is unpossessed.186

The same phenomenon occurs in connection with the particles mo: ‘yet’ and ka’ ‘PRCL’ (cf. 12.5.)319A subordinate clause with a nominalized predicate is negated by the particle loy occurring

Since not only verbs, but also nouns can function as the predicate of an affirmative main
clause (cf. 7.9), action nominalization applies to nouns as well. However, when turned into an
action noun, a predicate nominal undergoes a different morphological process than a verbal
predicate. It undergoes infixing reduplication, or it receives a suffix - e. I will first describe
nominalization by reduplication. In (7) and (8), adverbial clauses with predicate nominals are
shown:254

DSC
NEG motorbike-BR.piece<NMZ.N~>=n
‘It’s not a wrecked motorbike anymore.’ [i.e., it has been repaired] {EA, Moto 006}When a possessive predicate, formed by prefixing foot reduplication of a noun (cf. 3.7.6,
7.9.5) occurs in a subordinate or negative clause, it undergoes infixing reduplication as well.
The resulting word then contains two reduplicated elements, as shown in (10) and (11). The
fact that these predicates are reduplicated, like nouns, and do not nominalized through the
suffix -wa, like verbs, is a sign that morphologically, possessive predicates are nouns.","[491, 492]"
"90with an open first syllable, this syllable is long due to prosodic factors (cf. 2.8.2). This
prosodic lengthening can be taken into account for reduplication or not. The word ro:ya
‘house’, for example, can be marked for predicative possession in two ways:
(96)a. ro:~ro:ya
~
POSS~house
‘to own a house’b. roya~ro:ya
POSS~houseIn contrast, words whose first syllable is always long, e.g. disyllabic loans (cf. 2.9.2), do not
permit this variation, since the first syllable is inherently heavy. This is the case with the word
wa:ka ‘cow’ (cf. (95)b above), which cannot undergo disyllabic reduplication:
(97)* waka~wa:ka
POSS~cow
(‘to own cows’)Prefixing reduplication marking a possessive predicate can cooccur with infixing
reduplication. In (98), an example is given of a possessive predicate formed of a noun marked
for inalienable possession (cf. 3.7.5). It is structured as follows. In (98)a, the noun charayelo
‘honey’ is marked by infixing reduplication for inalienable possession, as in (92) and (93)a
above, with the possessor expressed by an internally cliticized bound pronoun. In (98)b, the
same noun is marked as a possessive predicate by prefixing foot reduplication; its argument is
expressed by the externally cliticized bound pronoun (cf. 3.9.2, 7.9.1). In (98)c, finally, the
two reduplicative processes occur on the same base: the inalienably possessed noun in (98)a is
marked by prefixing foot reduplication, as in (98)b, as a possessive predicate in a relative
clause.
(98)a. charaye<lo~>lo=is
syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=pl.a

occurs in a subordinate or negative clause (cf. (99)a and b, respectively). Here, the noun with
the foot reduplication undergoes additional infixing reduplication (cf. 3.7.4):91(99)a. in a

(100)kas
chara<ka’>ye-lo=i
NEG syrup<IRR>-BR.liquid=pl
‘They don’t have honey.’{JM 17, 278c}Interestingly, both processes have in common that the form of the possessive reduplication is
determined by the first iambic foot of the base, as is the position of the irrealis marker. It is
striking that these morphological processes, which are related in meaning but formally quite
distinct, are influenced by the same prosodic feature of the base.","[113, 114, 115]"
"2567Clause and sentence structureIn this chapter, the most important aspects of simple and complex sentences in Movima are
described. Before going into details in the following sections, I want to point out some crucial
properties of Movima clause structure.
First of all, Movima has a hierarchical alignment system. There is no case marking and no
agreement indicating grammatical relations. Word order is fixed, but it is semantically
determined: in a transitive clause, the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded
as the first core argument (ARG1) and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the
second core argument (ARG2). The semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or
inverse voice marking on the verb, as described in 7.5. An effect of this system is an
ergativity split, since the alignment of grammatical relations and semantic roles is switched by
the voice markers (cf. 7.5.3).
The fact that due to the hierarchical alignment system, grammatical relations are not
distinguished by case marking, agreement, or word order, makes it difficult to attach labels
such as “subject” and “object” to the syntactic positions. J. Judy (1965) uses these terms,
labelling the first argument in a transitive clause “subject” and the second argument “object”.
This, however, is a problem in inverse clauses, where, as Judy also points out, the second
argument encodes the agent.
Moreover, it can be shown that if anything can be analysed as the subject in Movima, this is
not the first, but the second core argument, which represents the undergoer in a direct
transitive clause. This becomes apparent from the structure of relative clauses, described in
7.11. In addition, the second, but not the first core argument can be deleted in coordination,
which is also a criterion for subjecthood (cf. Keenan 1976). However, it may be misleading to
use the term “subject” for the second transitive argument, since it has some untypical
properties. In the direct construction, which can be seen as pragmatically less marked since it
indicates that the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy acts on the participant lower on
the hierarchy, the second argument encodes the undergoer. Also, this argument is not
obligatorily realized. To avoid confusion, I use the neutral terms ARGintr for the intransitive
argument, ARG1 for the first transitive argument, and ARG2 for the second transitive
argument. ARGintr and ARG2 are furthermore subsumed under the term “absolutive
argument”.
Note, furthermore, that ARG1, the first argument in a transitive clause, is encoded in the
same way as the possessor (cf. 6.1).134
This chapter is organized as follows. Sections 7.1–7.8 discuss constituent order, argument
encoding, and the assignment of semantic roles in affirmative main clauses. In Sections 7.9–
7.10, I describe affirmative main clauses with nonverbal predicates, as well as arguments that
contain a verb. In Section 7.11, relative clauses are described. Section 7.12 presents the main
134The peculiarities of the Movima system outlined here may arise from the possibility that, at least historically,
all clauses are basically equational. Under this view, ARG1 represents a possessor, and the absolutive argument
represents the intransitive subject everywhere. This means that the proposition ‘I hit the dog’ would in Movima
be expressed as ‘my hitten one is the dog’. The term “subject” would be uncontroversial then. For an analysis of
other languages along these lines, see Sasse 1991.","[279, 280]"

This book is a description of Movima, a genetically unclassified language spoken in the
Amazon area of Bolivia. This book is intended for linguists from different backgrounds, and
is not based on any particular theoretical framework.
In the present chapter, I will give general information on Movima and its speakers. This
includes the historic, geographic and sociolinguistic background, previous research on the
language, and information on the fieldwork and data on which the present study is based. In
addition, I will give an overview of the main characteristics of Movima by comparing them to
characteristic features of other Amazonian languages. The final two sections give an outline
of the structure of the book and of the way in which the data are presented.","[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

Canonical action nominalization creates a noun that constitutes the predicate of a canonical
subordinate clause (cf. 7.12 ) or of a clause containing the negative particle kas (cf. 7.15.1).
As was discussed in 7.12.1, the noun that is created through action nominalization is
relational, i.e., obligatorily possessed. The only exception to this concerns nominalized forms
that are first verbalized through -ni ‘PRC’, to be discussed in 11.9.4 below.
In (1)–(3), examples are given in which the predicate contains the suffix -wa. As can be
seen, the predicate is preceded by an article, together with which it constitutes an NP. In (1),
the action nominal253 represents the absolutive argument of a transitive clause. In (2), it is the
predicate of a purposive clause, introduced by the particle bo (cf. 12.1.4). In (3), the action
nominal forms a temporal adverbial clause (cf. 7.12.3).

occurs “action nominal”.","[490, 491]"
"InterjectionsAccording to Schachter (1985: 58), interjections are “words, often of an exclamatory
character, that can constitute utterances in themselves, and that usually have no syntactic
connection to any other words that may cooccur with them.” In Movima, these include: jo:jo’
‘yes’, ka:’i ‘no’, and chu’ ‘stop it!’. I will illustrate them in turn.12.6.1. jo:jo’ ‘yes’
This is an affirmative interjection. It can be translated as ‘yes’. However, it is normally not
used as an answer to a question (cf. 7.14), but as a positive reaction to, or a reinforcement of,
the preceding utterance. Example (246) is from a dialogue, and in (247), the speaker
reinforces what she has said before:

{Sicurí 092}12.6.2. ka:’i ‘no’

{EA 8, 045}Sometimes, ka:’i is used in the same way as kas (cf. 12.5.1 above), i.e., in combination with a
nominalized predicate (cf. (249)):

{EA, Vida 020}The particle ka:’i is sometimes realized as ka:. Its ending -‘i can probably be analyzed as the
dummy element (cf. 2.9.5). However, I represent this morpheme as monomorphemic, since
the element ka: normally functions as the preclusive particle (cf. 12.5.5 above).12.6.3. chu’ ‘stop it!’

{EC 15, 088}12.7. The filler particle eney
There is one particle used when the speaker does not find the right word: eney. This particle
occurs most often inside an NP, i.e. after the article, and is also found after the relativizer.
Both instances can be found in (252). This is an example in which the speaker looks for a
word of Spanish origin, anteteta:nika ‘anti-tetanus vaccination’.

{EA, Lagartija 039}Possibly, eney is a historically complex form, consisting of the demonstrative adverb ney
‘here’ and a preceding element e. Judy & Judy (1967) describe an element e- that precedes
demonstratives. However, this element does not occur in the database used here. If the filler549particle eney can indeed be traced back to a demonstrative, then it may be a calque on the
Spanish filler particle este ‘this (masculine)’.","[571, 572, 573]"

The particle toje (pronounced as [t ] in rapid speech) has an emphasizing function. It is
usually translated into local Spanish as caramba ‘good grief!’. In contrast to the Spanish
expression, however, toje is never used as an exclamation of its own.

The only evidential marker (apart from the demonstratives, which imply first-hand
knowledge; cf. 4.9) is the particle an. The central functions of this particle seem
contradictory: on the one hand, it is used to indicate that the speaker knows about the event
only from hearsay.271 On the other hand, it is used to catch the hearer’s attention, often for
things that are being witnessed at the moment of speaking. There seem to be no formal
criteria by which these functions can be distinguished. The ‘hearsay’ function is illustrated by
(183)–(185):
271In local Spanish, this is expressed by the interjection dizque ‘they say’.","[556, 557]"

"42242310 Modal and aspectual morphology
This chapter describes morphemes, most of them verbal affixes, that in principle do not
influence the valency of the verb to which they are attached. While its is a very heterogeneous
group, most of these morphemes can be described as having an aspectual or a modal function.
The suffix -ka (cf. 10.1), which shares some morphological properties with nominalizing
morphemes (cf. 11.1), can be seen as an aspectual suffix. It has different functions, depending
on the type of base to which it is attached. On derivational bases with specified semantic
valency (cf. 8.7), it indicates that the action is carried out immediately or earlier than normal.
On inherently monovalent roots, which normally do not serve as derivational bases, -ka
indicates that the action cannot be carried out. In this last function, -ka is related to another
suffix, -nira (cf. 10.1.4), which, when negated, also indicates an impossibility.
The marker -ka ‘multiple event’ (cf. 10.2.1) indicates that there are several occurrences of
the same situation. This affix is inserted after the root on morphologically complex bases.
There is an apparently related fossilized morpheme kaka (cf. 10.2.2), which occurs in
restricted contexts and can also function as a root.
The irrealis infix <a’>, with the base-final allomorph -RED~a’, (cf. 10.3) is a modal
morpheme. In affirmative contexts, it indicates that the situation will occur at some
unspecified moment in the future. In negative contexts, it indicates the non-existence of the
absolutive participant. In this function, <a’> is also found on nouns. Its morphological
properties were described in detail in 3.6.2.
The suffix -na:na’, for which I adopt Judy & Judy’s (1967) term ‘pseudo’, can also occur
on nominal as well as on verbal bases. This suffix is rare, and I will only give a few examples
in 10.4.
Section 10.5 focuses on the modal suffixes -sicha’kwa ‘desiderative’ and -baycho ‘mental
state’, which usually indicate mental inclinations of the participant. While creating
morphological nouns, the words with these suffixes usually function as monovalent
predicates.
The intensifying suffix with its two allomorphs, -u’ and -ay’ (cf. 10.6), occurs directly on
the verb root, which is then followed by eventual further morphemes and by voice markers. A
homophonous morpheme also occurs on phasal verbs, described in 10.7.
Section 10.7 describes a complex process by which phasal aspect is expressed. A root or
base is attached to a “phasal” verb root, and according to the inherent valency of the
incorporated base, either the suffix -u’/-ay’ or the suffix -kaka is attached.","[445, 446, 447, 448]"
"470While all predicate nominals can be reduplicated in order to function as the predicate of a
negative or subordinate clause, the suffix - e has a more limited distribution. First of all, the
form with - e occurs more often in negative than in subordinate clauses. The following
example illustrates this. In (16)a, the adjective tochi’ ‘small’ occurs in a negative clause with
the suffix - e. In (16)b, it is shown that in a subordinate clause, this suffix cannot be used.
Rather, the reduplicated form has to be used, as shown by (16)c (cf. also (8) above).

obl-ART.n.p small<NMZ.N~> PRO.n.a old-PRC-DR
‘When I was small, that (was where) I grew up.’{JM 16, 253b}Furthermore, nominalization through - e is very common on adjectives, while more
prototypical nouns are only rarely found with this suffix (cf. 3.10.4.3). The only text example
of a noun with the suffix - e in a negative clause is given in (17):
(17)jayna kas
don-’i- e=os
chi:~chi
DSC NEG blood-D-NMZ.N=n.p MD~go_out
‘It wasn’t blood anymore what came out.’{EA, Cbba 159}The reason why in (17), the predicate nominal don’i ‘blood’ is marked by - e and not by
reduplication, may be that when reduplicated, the word would be homophonous with the
inalienably possessed form. Recall from 3.7.5 and 6.4.1 that like action nominalization,
inalienable possession is marked by infixing reduplication. This is illustrated in (18) for the
same word as in (17) above. The sentence in (18) is the one which follows (17) in the
narration.
(18)ba:-ra
jayna
os
don-<‘i:~>‘i
jayna
finish-BE.ntr DSC
ART.n.p blood-<INAL~>D DSC
‘I had lost all my blood.’ [lit: “My blood was finished.”] {EA, Cbba 160}In this particular context, it is possible that the suffix - e is used in (17) in order to distinguish
the negated predicate nominal from the inalienably possessed noun in (18). However, it can
still be concluded that adjectives are more often combined with the suffix - e than nouns,
especially in negative clauses, so that the tendency to use - e on adjectives can be seen as a
distinction between the two word classes.
Before concluding the present section, I will briefly discuss verbs that contain the ending
-wa, but where this element does not have a nominalizing function. Examples include471tivijni:wa ‘feel pain’ (cf. (19)) and chajani:wa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)):

DSC be_ashamed--pl
‘When there are many people when theyi go out [onto the stage], theyi are ashamed.’
{EA, Tolkosya I 028}When these verbs are nominalized, the nominalizing suffix -wa is attached. This shows that
-wa in (19) and (20) above is not the nominalizing suffix, but part of the verbal base.

‘I am not ashamed of myself, of how I am.’
{HR, TX 088}While the verb chajaniwa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)) always occurs with the ending -wa, there is
also a verb tivijni ‘hurt’, derived from the noun ti:vij ‘pain’, which does not contain the
ending -wa. Here, a difference in meaning can be observed: the argument of the verb tivijni
‘hurt’ expresses the body part which hurts, whereas the argument of the verb tivijni:wa ‘feel
pain’ expresses the person or animal that feels pain. Compare (24) below, which contains the
nominalized form of the verb tivijni ‘hurt’, with (19) above, which contains the verb tivijni:wa
‘feel pain’. Apart from the difference in meaning, ‘hurt’ versus ‘feel pain’, the form in (24) is
a relational noun, while the one in (19) above is a monovalent verb.

{EA, Lagartija 021}Thus, there is a suffix -wa, homophonous with the nominalizer, which has an applicative
function, raising a new participant to argument function. However, this suffix does not seem
to be productive, since only these two examples were found.","[493, 494, 495]"
"89Since both nominalization (cf. 3.7.4) and adnominal inalienable possession are marked by
infixing reduplication, homophonous forms can occur. Consider the possessed noun in (93)a
and the negative predicate nominal in (93)b:
(93)a. is
charaye-<lo~>lo=i
ART.pl syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=pl
‘their honey (of the bees)’
b. kas
charaye-<lo~>lo=i
NEG

‘It’s not honey.’44{JM 16, 392a}Here, the context or the construction (containing an article in (93)a or the negative particle in
(93)b) serves to disambiguate the homophonous forms. For a more detailed discussion of
nominalized predicates of subordinate and negative clauses, see 7.12 and 7.15, respectively.
For a description of the nominalizing processes, see 11.1.","[112, 113]"
"540In yet another example, future tense is indicated by the adverbial clause nas tawa’ni
‘tomorrow’:

REL FOC take-DR obl-ART.n.a cow

‘Tomorrow the plane will leave [...] which (will) take the beef over there to El Perú.’
{EA, Cbba 213}In all these cases, the form kwey clearly represents the focus marker (kaw), since its use as a
past-tense marker is ruled out by the context.
In order to focus on an argument and to indicate immediate past tense in the same clause,
kaw and kwey can cooccur. This is shown in (214) and (215) below. In (214), the particles can
be distinguished by their position. The clause-initial particle is the one that indicates past
tense, while the particle following the free pronoun is the focus marker kaw, in accordance
with the analysis of (206) and (207) above:

{EA 7, 057k}Thus, the particles kaw can usually be clearly distinguished from kwey, even though the two
are often homophonous.
However, there are also cases in which the distinction between the two particles is difficult
to draw, and where a more detailed analysis is needed. This is especially the case when kwey
occurs inside a noun phrase that contains a verb, as in (217):
(217)jayna
kas oso’-ni-wa

kwey
DSC
NEG DM.n.p-PRC-NMZ ART.n.p FOC
‘There was no one left who would look for (it).’sal-na
search-DR
{GC 18, 396}541In this example, the particle inside the NP can be identified as the focus particle kaw. This is
because the referent of the NP that contains a direct transitive verb, salna ‘search’, is not the
undergoer, as would be predicted from the voice marker -na (cf. 8.1.1, 8.2), but the actor. This
is the typical effect of the focus particle kaw, which demotes the former ARG2 from the
clausal core (cf. 7.8). If the focus particle were absent, or if the form kwey were the tense
marker, then the NP in (217) would denote the undergoer of the event, and the translation of
the clause would be ‘the (thing) I looked for was not there anymore’.
Example (218) is similar to (217) above. Here, the fact that the particle inside the NP is
realized as kaw serves as evidence that it is the focus marker and not the tense particle:
(218)kaw
FOCka:w-e

‘Many cried for (him).’ji:-ba:-na
cry-BR.round-DR
{GC 18, 394a}In other cases, where the exchangeability with /kaw/ was not tested, the element kwey within
an NP rather seems to be the tense particle. For example, in (219) below, the referent of the
NP containing a direct bivalent verb is the undergoer. The presence of the element kwey does
not have the effect of demoting the argument denoting the undergoer, as it does in (217) and
(218) above. Therefore, it probably represents the past-tense particle kwey.

{EA 19, 315d}Negative particlesNegation in Movima is expressed by particles, usually in combination with a morphological
modification of the predicate. In most cases, the predicate either contains a negative marker
(e.g. the irrealis infix <a’>), or it is nominalized. The negative particles, and the types of
predicates or clauses they occur with, are listed in (220):

"47211.1.2. Partial action/state nominalization
Clauses negated through the particles mo: ‘not yet’ or by the prohibitive particle ka’ ‘don’t’
(cf. 12.5.3 and 12.5.4), as well as negative relative clauses (cf. and 7.15.2 and 12.5.2), also
involve action nominalization. However, unlike in clauses negated through the particle kas
described in the previous section, only monovalent predicates are nominalized in these
constructions, whereas bivalent predicates remain unmodified (cf. Ch. 8 for the valency
distinction of predicates). Furthermore, unlike in canonical action nominalization, the
nominalized predicate in these constructions is not relational. In the remainder of this section,
I illustrate this type of nominalization by using examples with the particle mo:. For examples
with the prohibitive particle ka’, see 12.5.4; for examples of negative relative clauses, see
7.15.2 and 12.5.2.
To observe the difference between the treatment of monovalent and bivalent predicates in
these constructions, consider the examples in (25)a and b. Here, verbs with the base jam e
‘tied onto something’ occur in the mo:-construction. While the resultative, monovalent form
jam e ‘tied onto something’ in (25)a is nominalized, the direct bivalent form jama: e ‘to tie X
onto something’ in (25)b is not.

yet 1 tie-DR-CO ART.n dog
‘I haven’t tied the dog (onto something) yet.’{EA 19, 203}Nominalization of a bivalent predicate would be ungrammatical in this construction. This is
shown by (26), where, as in (25)b above, the predicate is marked as bivalent by the direct
voice marker (cf. 8.1.1):
(26)* mo: lirij-na:-wa--’ne
yet shake-DR-NMZ--f
(‘She hasn’t shaken it yet.’){EA 19, 146g}Since a predicate nominal is monovalent (cf. 7.9.1), it is nominalized in a clause with mo: ‘not
yet’, ka’ ‘don’t’, or in a negative relative clause. As in canonical action nominalization (cf.
11.1.1), a predicate nominal in these constructions undergoes infixing reduplication, as in
(27)a, or receives the nominalizing suffix - e, as in (27)b.

‘This one isn’t a bull yet, it’s still small.’
{EA, 19, 291}473Note that in contrast to canonical action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1), the action nominals in
clauses with mo: ‘not yet’, ka’ ‘don’t’, or in negative relative clauses, are never relational.
Consider the nominalized forms in (25)a, (27)a and (27)b: in neither of these examples is the
argument attached to the predicate by an internal clitic, as it is in canonical action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.1).
Thus, we are dealing here with a type of nominalization that is, in principle, identical with
canonical action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1). However, it does not apply to all bases, and it
does not create a relational noun. Therefore, I label it “partial nominalization”.11.1.3. -na ‘action nominalization of consequence’
The nominalizing suffix -na only occurs in adverbial clauses introduced by the particle jan
‘consequently’ (cf. 7.12.6), including interrogative clauses introduced by e -jan ‘why’ (cf.
3.10.6). Like canonical action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1), it occurs on monovalent as well as
on bivalent predicates. The resulting noun is always relational. Consider the example of a
monovalent predicate in (28) and of a bivalent predicate in (29):
(28)(29)jan n-os

‘That is why they don’t want anybody to visit them.’{HR, TX 126}There are not many examples of a predicate nominal in an adverbial clause with jan.
However, unlike in canonical action nominalization, it seems that not only verbs, but also
nouns receive the suffix -na in an adverbial clause introduced by jan. In (30)a, the adjective
dinra ‘hard’ occurs in such a clause, and it receives the suffix -na. When this adjective occurs
in a clause with the negative particle kas, as in (30)b, it is nominalized through reduplication.
This is identical to the way in which other predicate nominals are modified in canonical
action nominalization (cf. 11.1.1). It can be concluded from this example that in adverbial
clauses introduced by jan, predicate nominals behave in the same way as verbal predicates.
This is in contrast to canonical action nominalization, where verbs and nouns undergo
different processes.

"9(i)Most languages have prefixes, and there are fewer prefix than suffix positions
There is only one “real” prefix in Movima, the oblique case marker n-. Other prefixes
are reduplicated elements. Otherwise, Movima is mainly suffixing.(j)(On typical order of prefixes)
Does not apply: only one prefix (n- or a reduplicated element) can occur at a time.(k)Most verbal categories (e.g. tense, aspect, modality, direction) are expressed through
optional suffixes
All these categories are expressed not by suffixes, but by optional particles in
Movima, whose distribution in the clause is relatively free. Tense is, in addition, a
nominal category, expressed by referential elements.(l)Subordinate clauses typically involve nominalized verbs, the type of subordination
being marked on the verb
Indeed, subordination (as well as main-clause negation) always involves
nominalization of the predicate. The type of subordination, however, is either not
overtly indicated, or indicated by a particle preceding the subordinate clause.(m)If there is noun incorporation, typically only those nouns which are obligatorily
possessed can be incorporated, and they typically precede the verb root
There are different types of productive noun incorporation, involving unpossessed
nouns or body-part-terms. Apart form body-part terms, obligatorily possessed nouns
cannot be incorporated. The incorporated nominal element follows the root.(n)In many languages adverbs and adpositions may be incorporated into the verb
This does not seem to be the case in Movima.(o)There is generally only a small class of lexical numbers
Indeed, there are only four number terms, from 1 to 4, and the terms for 1 and 4 seem
to be morphologically complex (“no other” and “several times two,” respectively).","[32, 33]"
"111.10. The organization of this book
The organization of this book is as follows. Chapter 2 describes the phonological and
morphophonological properties of the language. In the section on intonation, the difference
between declarative and interrogative sentences is explained.
In the first part of Chapter 3, the different morphological units and processes are introduced,
including the different kinds of cliticization by which the grammatical relations are
distinguished. The second part of this chapter provides an overview of the parts of speech in
Movima, paying special attention to the status of adjectives.
The morphological, semantic, and pragmatic properties of the different types of referential
elements, which play a central role in the grammar of Movima, are described in Ch. 4.
Chapters 5 and 6 deal with noun morphology. In Ch. 5, independent nouns, compounds, and
the different kinds of bound nominal elements (bound roots etc., including classificatory
elements) are described. Since possession is central for the semantic classification of nouns
and their morphological properties, this phenomenon is described separately in Ch. 6.
Chapter 7 deals with Movima syntax. Here, clause structure and argument encoding are
described, the hierarchical alignment system is explained, and different sentence types are
presented. The syntactic effect of argument incorporation, whose morphological
characteristics are presented in Ch. 9, is also illustrated in this chapter. Chapter 7 furthermore
includes a description of the different types of subordination. In this way, negation, which is
expressed differently for main and subordinate clauses, can be described in one single section.
Coordination, which involves the combination of two main clauses, is described in Ch. 12,
which deals with the different types of coordinating particles.
The three following chapters, 8, 9, and 10, are dedicated to verb morphology. In Ch. 8, the
intriguing system of voice and valency marking is described. Since this system interacts
closely with semantic and lexical properties of the verbal bases, the different types of verb
roots and bases are described in this chapter as well.
Chapter 9 gives a more detailed account of complex verbal bases, which contain
morphological elements that interact with the valency of the verb. In the first part of this
chapter, the different types of noun incorporation are described: argument incorporation,
which leads to a decrease in valency, and modifier incorporation, which occurs prior to
valency assignment. The second part describes the causative, benefactive, and applicative
morphemes.
Chapter 10 deals with other verbal morphemes, which have a modal and/or an aspectual
function. Formally, they have in common that they do not interact with verbal valency, even
though their function and productivity can be influenced by the valency properties of the base.
In Chapter 11, nominalizing and verbalizing morphemes are presented. Some of these are
also described, where relevant, in earlier chapters, (e.g., in Ch. 3 on the noun/verb distinction,
in Ch. 7 on subordination). Since nominalization and verbalization often interact, both
processes are described together in this chapter.
Chapter 12 gives an overview of the large class of particles. These inlude clausecoordinating particles, TAM particles, and discourse particles.","[34, 35]"
"1.9. Structural characteristics of Movima
Movima has many characteristics typical of Amazonian languages. I will compare it to the
features listed as typically Amazonian in Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999: 8f.).
(a)8polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
Movima is agglutinating, i.e., most morphemes have only one meaning, and displays a
limited degree of fusion. It is head-marking in that one transitive argument as well aspossession are marked on the predicate or possessed noun, respectively. It is
problematic to classify the language as polysynthetic, however. Polysynthetic features
of Movima are that a clause can consist of the predicate alone, and that there is
productive noun incorporation. However, while voice/valency and applicative
categories are encoded by verbal morphology, tense, location, and direction (typical
features of polysynthesis in Amazonian languages, cf. Payne 1990: 214) are not
morphologically expressed on the verb, and person only to a limited degree.
Moreover, Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), a feature
untypical of polysynthetic languages.
(b)/ / in the vowel inventory, contrastive nasalization of vowels
Neither the central unrounded vowel [ ], nor contrastive nasalization of vowels exist in
Movima. The five vowel phonemes are i, e, a, o, u.(c)Extensive classifier and/or semantically based gender systems
Movima has a semantically-based gender system, marked on the referential elements
(articles, pronouns, demonstratives). This system is independent of the classifier
system, which seems to have arisen through compounding and incorporation.(d)Only few oblique cases
Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the
referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is
absent.(e)Possession marked on the possessed noun, not on the possessor; most widespread
word order is ‘possessor possessed’
Possession is marked on the possessed noun. Since the possessed noun is marked by
an enclitic encoding the possessor, however, the word order is ‘possessed possessor’.(f)Just one core argument cross-referenced on the verb
This is true for Movima: the only core argument that is obligatorily cross-referenced is
the transitive argument encoding the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy.(g)‘Split-ergative’ systems arise due to complex rules determining which core argument
is cross-referenced on the verb
A split-ergative pattern can indeed be observed in Movima, arising from the
hierarchical alignment system: the transitive argument lower on the animacy hierarchy
(in subordinate and negative clause, the argument higher on the hierarchy) is encoded
like the intransitive argument, regardless of whether it is A or O.(h)The bound pronominal forms marking a possessor within an NP are the same as one
of the bound pronominal paradigms for marking core arguments of a clause
This is indeed the case. The possessor is encoded in the same way as the first
argument of a transitive clause, which is the only argument obligatorily encoded.","[31, 32]"
"11.1. Action/state nominalization
Action/state nominalization (short: action nominalization) is the most productive
nominalizing process in Movima. It creates a noun that denotes an event or state. In contrast
to other nouns, an action/state noun can only occur in an NP or in a negative clause. This is to
say, it is either preceded by an article or by a negative particle, but cannot occur
independently.252 Unlike other words derived through nominalization, action nouns cannot be
nominalized a second time.
Three subtpyes of action nominalization can be distinguished: canonical action
nominalization (cf. 11.1.1), “partial” action/state nominalization, which only occurs in
particular types of negative clauses (cf. 11.1.2), and action/state nominalization of
“consequence”, which only occurs in a subordinate clause introduced by the particle jan
‘CSQ’ (cf. 11.1.3). In Table 31, an overview of the properties of the three types is given.
Each type is described in more detail in the following sections.",[490]
"3.7.4. Nominalization of predicate nominals
The predicate of a subordinate or negative clause is generally nominalized in Movima (cf.
7.12, 7.15, and 11.1).43 This concerns both verbal predicates as well as predicates that are
morphologically nouns, i.e. predicate nominals. Verbal predicates are nominalized through
the suffixation of -wa. A predicate nominal, in contrast, is marked by infixing reduplication.
Example (90) illustrates this for a subordinate clause, which is, in fact, an oblique noun
phrase:
(90)n-os
tolkos<ya:~>ya
obl-ART.n.p girl<NMZ.N~>
‘when I was a girl’ [lit. “at my being a girl”]Example (91) shows the reduplicated noun in a negative clause:
(91)kas
ya:lowe-<pa~>pa=u
NEG drink-<NMZ.N~>AG=m
‘He’s not a drinker.’{EA 9, 146a}As will be argued in 3.10 below, the fact that predicate nominals are reduplicated when they
occur in negative or subordinate clauses, whereas verbal predicates receive the suffix -wa in
these constructions, is seen as a defining criterion for the morphological distinction between
nouns and verbs in Movima.",[112]
"50112.1.1. Conjunctive coordination: che ‘and’
Full clauses can be combined by simple juxtaposition. The following is an example of this, in
which the division between the clauses is indicated by a comma, symbolizing a brief pause:

{EA, Tigre y perro 018}In these examples, there is no formal evidence that indicates whether the second subordinate
clause is embedded in the first subordinate clause or directly in the main clause. In (23), the
second subordinate clause can be interpreted as being on the same level as the first, whereas
in (24), it seems that the second subordinate clause depends on the first.","[524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529]"
"141The forms of the article presented in Table 11 can, therefore, be split up into two elements.
However, the element a in (33) still functions as a determiner, even though it lacks the
determining morpheme /s/. Possibly, the final / / is a conflation of the determiner /s/ and the
first-person marker / /. A solution cannot be proposed here. Therefore, I will not represent the
article as consisting of two morphemes: the contexts in which its elements can occur
separately from each other are very restricted, and there are cases in which a morphemic
analysis is not appropriate, as in (33). Here, the article will be represented as a single form, a .
A particle which is formally very similar to the article is the main-clause negative particle
kas. It looks like the presential neuter article preceded by a k-, and it is obligatorily combined
with a nominal form, i.e., an action nominal (cf. (34)). Moreover, the first-person marker also
replaces the final s of this word, in the same way as shown for the article in (33) (cf. (34)b):
(34)a. kas
joy-wa=n
NEG go-NMZ=n
‘You don’t go.’b. ka
joy-wa=n
NEG.1 go-NMZ=2
‘We (incl.) don’t go.’The negative particle is described in 12.5.1.
It is crucial to note that the Movima article is neutral with respect to definiteness. When a
visible entity is referred to, definiteness is implied by a demonstrative, as in (29)−(32) above.
When the referent is absent, definiteness is expressed by the demonstrative adverb ney ‘here’
(from n-ay ‘obl-DM.spk.n’, cf. 4.6) directly after the article, as in (35) and (36):

Many people have helped me get this work done. First and foremost, my gratitude goes to
Pieter Muysken, who has made this project possible by hosting it within his Spinoza
programme “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Not only did I
benefit from his insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript, which were always
to the point and opened new lines of thought for me. He also gave me the feeling that
whatever problem there would be on the way, he would try to help out. Whenever I
approached him for linguistic or non-linguistic advice, I got an open ear, no matter whether it
was the right moment or not. His confidence in this project and his constant encouragement
were an enormous support.
I was also very lucky in that during the entire project, I had Rik van Gijn as my office mate.
This meant lots of fun, discussions, and the possibility to exchange experiences on life in the
linguistic world. My work has benefited greatly from Rik’s insights and from his talent to
present things systematically.
Hein van der Voort, occasional office mate, advised me in many ways. In particular, I am
very grateful for his extremely detailed, critical and helpful comments on the entire
manuscript.
I owe many thanks to Mily Crevels, who has helped me a lot especially at the beginning of
this project. In particular, Mily accompanied me to Santa Ana in 2001, and through her I got
acquainted with the people who became my closest friends there. With respect to field work
and dealing with practical matters in the Beni, Mily gave me the most valuable advice.
Outside the Spinoza group, I want to thank the following linguists for commenting on
earlier drafts of specific chapters of this book, for discussing the data with me, and/or for
advising me on particular topics: Willem Adelaar, Martin Böhler, Werner Drossard, Dan
Everett, Mats Exter, Ad Foolen, Colette Grinevald, Carlos Gussenhoven, Birgit Hellwig,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, Helen de Hoop, Haike Jacobs, Leonid Kulikov, Geraldine Legendre,
Andrej Malchukov, Maarten Mous, Doris Payne, Hans-Jürgen Sasse, René Schiering, Anna
Siewierska, Leon Stassen, and Fernando Zúñiga. I am especially grateful to Werner Drossard,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, and Hans-Jürgen Sasse for the long and inspiring discussions on the
Movima voice and valency system, whose essence I would probably never have understood
otherwise. My particular gratitude also goes to Willem Adelaar and Carlos Gussenhoven for
discussing earlier versions of the phonology chapter with me, and for their patience in
answering my numerous questions on the topic. In addition, I am deeply indebted to Willem
Adelaar for his valuable comments on the entire manuscript. And Maarten Mous is especially
thanked for sitting with me for hours when I was desperate and did not know how this work
could ever come to an end.
Pilar Valenzuela is acknowledged for pointing out Movima to me as a possible language of
research.
I furthermore want to thank the participants of the Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen for
their comments on my talks, in particular Jürgen Bohnemeyer, Swintha Danielsen, Martina
Faller, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Girón, Katja Hanss, Roland Hemmauer, Sergio Meira,
Loretta O’Connor, and Frank Seifart. And without the critical questions from the participants
of my “Strukturkurs Movima” at the Linguistics Department in Cologne, some problems and
contradictions in my analyses would hardly ever have become apparent to me.iWhile it was not possible to integrate into the present work all the comments I got, they
highly increased my insight into the Movima grammar.
My research has also benefited greatly from the open and friendly atmosphere at the
Linguistics Department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. My thanks go particularly to
Helen de Hoop, Monique Lamers, Peter de Swart, Andrej Malchukov, Joost Zwarts, Wilske
Driessen, Janine van der Zijl, Else Havik, Margot van den Berg, and Marleen van de Vate.
It is hard to express my gratitude adequately to the Movima speakers who contributed the
data on which this grammar is based. Their hospitality and their willingness to teach me their
language were overwhelming.
First of all, I want to thank Esaltación Amblo Ovales, who took upon herself the task of
teaching me Movima. She is the best teacher I could have imagined, with her clarity of
pronunciation, her great memory, and her readiness to talk to me in Movima about all kinds of
topics. I am also grateful to her sister Etelvina and her cousin Modesta for receiving me in
their house with so much friendliness.
My thanks go furthermore to Julia Malale Humasa, my principal teacher during my first and
my last stay. Good-humoured and funny, yet serious when it came to analysing her language,
she is a delightful instructor.
I owe many thanks to Eligardo Chirimani Malue for working with me every day right from
the beginning. Without his linguistic insight and his careful judgment, it would never have
been possible to create such a large and useful text database. Apart from that, it is mainly due
to the fact that he and Melvin Rossel Yoqui took so much interest in maintaining their native
language that this research was carried out at all. The other members of the Subcentral
Indígena Movima are also acknowledged for supporting this project throughout.
I am furthermore grateful to Griselda Cáumol, Balvina Almaquio, Herlan Rojas, Ela Rossel,
Nelly Gualusna, Peregrina Cayú, Dora Vargas, Delmira Masaro, Nataniel Cáumol, Eleuterio
Mole, Alejandro Yónima, Juan Hualima, Bernarda Gualusna, María Esaltación Sepi, and Luis
Yalauma for teaching me their language.
Most of my teachers I would never have met without the help of Janeth Cayalo. She took
me with her on her motorbike every day during the beginning of my field work to find
consultants. I am deeply grateful to her.
This leads me to other friends in Santa Ana without whom my stays there would have been
much less effective and pleasant. Elsita Asbún, Esperanza Cayalo, Sonia Rivero, and Graciela
Rodríguez helped me in all aspects of daily life and became dear friends. Olga Arteaga and
her family provided a home for me for most the time, and their parrot was my most faithful
companion and probably the only one who learned words from me. I am also indebted to
Milton Villavicencio and his wife Loida for their great hospitality.
Outside Santa Ana, I especially want to thank Dr. Carlos Patiño Kühn in Santa Cruz for
taking my health worries off my back. Gudrun Birk is thanked for digging with me in the
APCOB library.
Last but not least, I want to thank my parents for their strong support at all times. My
friends in Cologne took up with my unusual lifestyle with much understanding. And my
deepest gratitude is with Harald Stoffels, who accompanied me towards and throughout this
entire project, and who is the main responsible for the fact that the years of thesis writing
were very happy years.iiContents

"121.11. Presentation of the data
The presentation of the Movima data as well as the English translation given deserve some
explanation.
When a bivalent predicate in Movima is not combined with a cliticized referential element,
this automatically implies that the first argument is the first person singular. All bivalent
verbs, furthermore, have an implicit second argument, even though it is not obligatorily
overtly realized. Therefore, a simple bivalent verb without person marking is translated into
English as a full clause with a first person singular subject; the implied second argument is
always represented as “X”:
(1)sal-na‘I look for X.’Temporal categories are often not overtly indicated in Movima, but inferred from the context.
Hence, a clause unmarked for tense can imply any temporal category (past, present, future),
and example (1) can mean ‘I (have) looked for X,’ ‘I will look for X,’ etc. This is a problem
for the English translation, which I have solved as follows: examples where no context exists
(in particular, elicitation examples) are translated into the English simple present, even when
this does not sound like good English. Examples where a temporal context exists, even when
this cannot be seen in the example itself, are translated in a way which fits into this context
(e.g., ‘I looked for X’ in (1)). In many examples, the translation fits with the Movima data,
since tense is often reflected in the article.
An area where Movima displays finer differentiations than English is spatial deixis: articles,
pronouns and demonstratives always indicate whether a referent is present, absent, in
existence or out of existence. Unless relevant for the discussion, I do not reflect these
categories in the English translation:
(2)a. i’nes kwe:ya
b. kinos
kwe:ya
c.
ART.f woman
ART.f.a woman
‘the/a woman (present)’
‘the/a woman (absent)’
‘the/a woman’
‘the/a woman’isnos
kwe:ya
ART.f.p woman
‘the/a woman (deceased)’
‘the/a woman’Occasionally, I use the indices i and j when it is necessary to indicate whether two are
coreferential or not:
(3)di’ joy-sicha’kwa=‘ne joy-che --i’ne, jankwa=sne
HYP go-DES=f
go-R/R--f
say=f.a
‘If she i wants to go, she i goes, shej said.’In the English translations, I use round brackets (as in (2)a and b) for relevant information
implicit in the Movima example. Contextual information, which cannot be inferred from the
example, is given in square brackets:
(4)sal-na‘I look for [her].’Many particles indicating tense, aspect, and mood (henceforth TAM) and discourse particles13are hard to translate. For example, it is not clear how the particle rey in (5), which occurs in
almost every sentence, should be translated:
(5)bo
rey
ban-cho
os
ben‘i
REAS
again bare-BR.inside ART.n.p grassland
‘Because the savannah was flat (you know/of course?).’{EA, Cbba 164}Therefore, I often do not translate these particles.
Square brackets with dots […] in the Movima example mean that a part of the text has been
omitted.
It was necessary to employ special symbols representing different morphological processes.
Most are taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules of 2003, like those given in (6).13 Others,
shown in (7), are specifically introduced for the purpose of the present description.

external cliticizationAs suggested by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, I sometimes use a colon ( : ) in the glosses when
it is not practical to segment the Movima word. For example, when a morphologically
complex noun is incorporated into a verb, this process can be represented more adequately
when the different morphemes of the noun are not set apart. In (8), an example is given of a
complex noun (cf. (8)a) that is incorporated into a verb (cf. (8)b). From the glosses in (8)b, it
can be seen that the noun consists of several morphemes. In (8)c, the morphemes are
separated; here, it is not directly clear from the representation whether the suffix - e modifies
the verb or, as is actually the case, belongs to the noun.

fact that when nominalized in a subordinate clause, the suffix -wa is attached to the base
ending in -nana’, as in (84). Nominal bases would either be verbalized by -ni first, or they
would undergo reduplication (cf. 11.1.1, 11.9).

particles, such as la’ and kwil (cf. 12.2.2 and 12.2.3, respectively). An NP with kwey typically

The particle la’ occurs most often inside or next to a noun phrase that contains a temporal or

event referred to took place. Hence, expressions such as ‘yesterday’ or ‘last year’ are formed
with la’. When la’ is combined with a noun phrase, this noun phrase always contains the past
article (cf. 4.8.2). The following examples are characteristic occurrences of la’:512(57)jo’yaj--us n-os

The tense particle nokowa, pronounced as [‘n kwa] in rapid speech, is derived from the

{EA, Patrona 043}Typically, nokowa is used for events on the same day, as in (68) and (69).
In the examples above, it could be seen that the particle nokowa can occur together with a
main-clause predicate (cf. (68) and (69)), but also in a subordinate clause, i.e. inside an NP
with an action noun (cf. (70)). In both cases, it modifies the predicate, also the nominal form
in the subordinate clause.
However, like other particles, nokowa can also occur inside a noun phrase with a concrete
referent. Here, it can be seen that it does not modify this noun, but the entire clause:

The particle jayna is one of the most frequent particles. It can be circumscribed as indicating
that a state or event holds when it did not before, or that it occurs or starts earlier than
expected.267 The following examples illustrate this particle in an affirmative and a negative
clause, respectively:

"As can be seen, Movima only deviates in minor points from the typical Amazonian patterns
observed by Dixon and Aikhenvald, while the similarities are striking. In the following
paragraphs, I will point out some other features of Movima, not mentioned in connection with
the list above.
Lexical tone, a feature found in a number of Amazonian languages, is not present in
Movima. Instead, there is contrastive vowel length. A consonant which deserves special
mention, since it does not seem to be common in the area, is the voiceless lateral fricative / /.
The syllable structure is simple: either CV or CVC.
Morphological features which deserve special mention include the existence of an infix,
inserted according to metric criteria. Different types of reduplication are not only frequent, but
also serve a wide range of functions which are noteworthy from a cross-linguistic perspective.
These include, among other things, voice marking, the marking of inalienable possession, the
expression of predicative possession, and nominalization. Furthermore, Movima uses10different cliticization processes to distinguish grammatical relations.
The major parts of speech, distinguished by their morphological properties, are verbs,
nouns, and particles. Adjectives form a subclass of nouns. Referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) constitute a category of their own, but display nounlike rather than
verblike properties. The class of particles is heterogeneous, the defining feature being that
particles are not productively combined with other morphemes. There are no ideophones.
The fine-grained system of reference and deixis, expressed by referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) is highly complicated, something which is not uncommon for
Amazonian languages. Gender, number, presence, absence, visibility, position, and motion
form the main parameters of deictic reference. The system also marks temporal categories on
nominal constituents, differentiating between actual or future existence and ceased existence
of the referent.
Compounding and incorporation occur frequently. The different degrees of lexicalization of
words created by these processes make the morphological description of Movima difficult.
The morphological entities that can form part of a compound or can be incorporated into a
verb are nouns, noun roots, truncated nominal elements, and other bound elements with
lexical content. Many of these morphemes have a classificatory function, indicating shape and
consistency of an entity. All this is typical for Amazonian languages (cf. Payne 1990).
Demonstratives and other pronouns are not combined with nominal elements.
Inalienable possession is an important criterion for the semantic classification of nouns.
Relational (inalienably possessed) nouns have to be overtly marked when denoting an
unpossessed or inalienably possessed entity; conversely, non-relational nouns are overtly
marked when denoting an inalienably possessed entity.
A clause can have maximally two core arguments, depending on the valency of the verb.
The valency of a verb is generally overtly indicated by voice markers, which also specify the
semantic role(s) of the argument(s). The productivity and function of voice markers depend
on semantic properties of the base. Grammatical relations are distinguished by the way in
which the argument is cliticized to the base. It seems that Movima displays syntactic
ergativity, most clearly in relative clauses.
As mentioned above, only the transitive argument higher on the animacy hierarchy is
obligatorily encoded. Strikingly, there is no obligatory marker for the first person singular, so
that this person is implicit on a bivalent predicate unmarked for person. This is untypical for
Amazonian languages (Dan Everett, p.c.). It has to do with the fact that, while all persons,
except the first, are encoded by enclitics, first and second person are (also) encoded by
optional bound pronouns preceding the predicate. The first person is not encoded by an
enclitic, but by the optional preverbal form only.
There is no copula. Instead, in equational or possessive clauses, nouns function as
predicates. Morphological verbs can occur in NPs, their voice marker specifying the referent.
Serial verb constructions only exist to a very limited degree, and always involve verbs of
directed motion.","[33, 34]"
"1.7. History of linguistic description
The first materials of the Movima language are lists of words and phrases (Hervás y Panduro
1787, D’Orbigny 1838, Heath 1883, Cardús 1886, Chamberlain 1910, Créqui-Montfort &
Rivet 1914, del Castillo 1929). Of these older lists, the one produced by the missionary
Cardús (1886) is most reproduced in the literature. In the 1960s, Movima was studied
extensively by Robert and Judith Judy of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The results
include a word list with a grammatical sketch (1962a), an outline of the phoneme inventory
(1962b), two articles on specific topics (J. Judy 1965 and R. Judy 1965), and a tagmemic
grammar (1965 and 1967).
A government-financed alphabetization campaign led by Colette Grinevald in 1995 raised
new interest in the language. An alphabet was created by the speakers, mainly based on the
orthography used by Judy and Judy, but with some changes (most importantly, c and qu were
replaced by k). The workshops, furthermore, resulted in the publication of a collection of
stories in Movima (Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Planificación 1998) and in a course
book introducing the alphabet (Ministerio de Educación et al. 2003). Also, Colette Grinevald
published an article on Movima noun classifiers (Grinevald 2002). Of the several unpublished
materials inspired by the workshops, an extensive word list by Eligardo Chirimani (1998)
deserves special mention. It needs to be said that without those workshops, the present
grammar may not have been written: it is because of the interest expressed by the Movima
participants that Movima was proposed to me as a language of research.
The present research project is part of the Spinoza project “Lexicon and Syntax” directed by
Pieter Muysken, which aims at describing as many of the language isolates in Amazonian
Bolivia and Brazil as possible. It is hoped that it will serve as a basis for the production of
materials that will help the Movimas to teach and learn their ancestral language.",[29]
"50012 Particles and adverbs
This chapter gives an overview of the morphemes I label particles. For the time being, I
comprise under this label all words that are neither verbs, nouns, adjectives, or referential
elements. Most of them are clearly function words, while others are perhaps better analysed as
adverbs. This is a matter of further research. Also their precise number remains to be
established.
Further research is also needed for a more fine-grained account of the properties of these
words, especially with regard to their syntactic scope and combinatory possibilities. Note that
several particles have different functions in different syntactic environments. I describe these
particles according to their respective functions.
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 12.1 presents clause-combining particles.
These can have a coordinating or a subordinating function. The large group of TAM particles
is described in 12.2 and 12.3. It seems possible to separate tense- and aspect marking
particles, described in 12.2, from modal and epistemic particles, described in 12.3. A particle
which deserves special discussion is the focus particle kaw, already introduced in 7.8; its
similarities to and differences from the tense particle kwey are discussed in 12.4. Section 12.5
deals with negative particles, some of which were already introduced in 7.15 and in 11.1.
Some interjections are illustrated in 12.6, and the filler particle eney, apparently the only filler
in Movima, is presented in 12.7.","[523, 524]"

undergo infixing reduplication. Examples (12) and (13) illustrate this.

nouns and verbs. This concerns the suffixation of - e.255 Examples (14) and (15) show that
reduplication and the suffixation of - e are, in principle, equivalent. Due to this equivalence, I
also gloss the suffix - e as ‘NMZ.N’.

"444Usually, a bivalent root is combined with the agentive voice marker -e e, which creates a
monovalent base, before -baycho or -sicha’kwa is attached:
(92)sal-e -sicha’kwa
search-AGT-DES
‘I want to search.’The suffix -sicha’kwa indicates that the actor wants to or has a physical urge to carry out the
action denoted by the verbal base, or that the event is about to happen. The difference is
determined by semantic properties of the verbal base. On a base which denotes an action, the
suffix indicates a desire. On a base which denotes an event whose only participant is an
undergoer, the suffix indicates that the event is about to occur.
The following examples illustrate -sicha’kwa as a desiderative marker on actor-oriented
bases (cf. also (90) and (92) above):

normally combined with the suffix -kwa ‘bodily process’ (cf. 8.3.2). When the desiderative
suffix -sicha’kwa is attached, the suffix -kwa ‘BDP’ is dropped.

different environments. Its function is clearest in negative contexts, where it indicates that the
participant is reluctant to carry out the action denoted by the base. Here, the suffix -baycho is
as productive as -sicha’kwa, and the two suffixes clearly contrast in meaning. Compare (101)
below with (93) above:

jayna ja’a
NEG go-MST=f.a
DSC just
‘She just didn’t want to go anymore.’{EA, Lagartija 037}Unlike -sicha’kwa, however, the suffix -baycho in a negative clause creates a predicate whose
argument is expressed like a possessor or like the first argument in a transitive clause (ARG1).
That is, the argument is obligatorily expressed by an internal clitic, as in (101); when the
argument is the first person singular, it is optionally encoded by the proclitic element of Set 1,
i.e., by attached to the preceding vowel (cf. 3.9.3, 4.1.2, 7.4):
246Note that also in (87) and (95) above, the suffix -sicha’kwa is attached to bases from which the verbalizing
suffix -ti’ is dropped. The basic forms of those verbs are jo -ti’ ‘to lay eggs’ (egg-VBZ) and tami:-ti’ ‘to give
birth’ (birth-VBZ), respectively.","[467, 468, 469]"
"107As can be observed from the list in (163) above, verbs are typically morphologically complex.
Unlike noun roots, most verb roots cannot occur on their own. When unmarked, which is the
case when they appear in the resultative voice (cf. 8.1.5), these roots are combined with the
dummy element -‘i (cf. 2.9.5):
(168)sal-’i
ju:-’i
toroj-’i‘to have been/have to be searched’
‘to have been/have to be scolded’
‘to have been/have to be dusted’There are only a few unanalysable verbs, such as ja:yi ‘run’ in (163). Examples of other verbs
of this type, which may be historically complex, include the following (with a tentative
morphological analysis, where possible):
(169)ilo:ni
‘to walk, move forward’ (-ni ‘PRC’)
iwa:ni
‘to converse’
(-ni ‘PRC’)
ya:lo:we ‘to drink’
(ya:- ‘under’?, -lo ‘BE.liquid’, -we ‘BE.person’)
jo’yaj
‘to arrive’
salmo
‘to return’Thus, while verbs are generally morphologically complex, this is not a defining characteristic
that distinguishes them from nouns.
The defining feature of a verb is that it cannot be combined with nominal morphemes (cf.
(174) below). Furthermore, verbs are productively combined with typical verbal morphemes,
for example:
(170)-wa
-pa
-poj
-kwa
-ka
-u’~-ay’action/state nominalization
agent nominalization

intensive3.10.2. Nouns
Nouns prototypically express time-stable concepts. Accordingly, the following can be seen as
prototypical Movima nouns:
(171)108champa
ro:ya
pa:ko
kwe:ya
china a
ko’o
me:sa
Leonilda‘stone’
‘house’
‘dog’
‘woman’
‘manioc’
‘tree’
‘table’
proper nameA noun typically occurs in a noun phrase. A noun phrase is defined by the fact that it contains
a determining referential element, usually an article, that specifies gender, number, and deictic
properties of the referent (cf. 4.4). In (172), noun phrases are given which contain the above
nouns:
(172)as
champa

ro:ya

pa:ko

i’nes Leonilda‘the/a stone’
‘the/a house’
‘the/a dog’
‘the/a woman’
‘(the) manioc roots’
‘the/a tree’
‘the/a table’
‘Leonilda’The occurrence in a noun phrase is not restricted to nouns: verbs can occur in a noun phrase
as well, as was shown in 3.10.1. And while this is more typical of verbs, a noun can also
occur outside a noun phrase, in which case it functions as a predicate (cf. 7.9.1). In (173)a and
b, the noun kwe:ya ‘woman’ is combined with referential elements representing the
arguments of the equational clauses.
(173)a. in
kwe:ya
1intr woman
‘I am a woman.’b. kwe:ya--‘ne
woman--f
‘She is a woman.’Since nouns can function as predicates and verbs can occur in noun phrases, the syntactic
position is not a defining property of these word classes.
A typical morphological property of nouns is that most of them, unlike most verbs, can
consist of a single root. The nouns in (171) and (172) are examples of independent roots.
However, since some noun roots cannot occur independently (cf. 3.1, 5.3.2), while some,
probably historically complex, verb roots can (cf. 3.10.1 below), this is not a defining
characteristic for distinguishing nouns from verbs, either.
The defining characteristic of nouns is that the morphemes in (174) can only be attached to
nominal bases, but not to verbs:
(174)-ti’
-maj
-ni
Foot~
<CV~>VBZ
VLC
PRC
POSS
NMZ.N(‘to make N’)
(‘to be in/on N’)
(‘to be/become N’)
(‘owner of N’)
(‘being N’)The most productive distinction between nouns and verbs is the form that verbal predicates
and predicate nominals take in negative or subordinate clauses. When the predicate is a
morphological noun, it is marked by infixing reduplication (<CV~>), as in (175)a and b. A109verbal predicate, in contrast, receives the suffix -wa in a subordinate or negative clause, as
shown in (176)a and b:
(175)a. n-as
kwe<ya:~>ya
obl-ART.n woman<NMZ.N~>

iloni:-wa
obl-ART.n walk-NMZ
‘when I walk’b. kas
iloni:-wa
NEG
walk-NMZ
‘I don’t walk.’However, while a verb cannot take the nominal suffixes in (174), this does not mean that a
base that can be combined with the verbal suffixes in (170) above. Nouns can be combined
with these suffixes, even though this is of limited productivity and may be the result of a more
complicated process, which can be outlined as follows.
The verbalizing suffix -ti’, described in 11.5, is one of the most productive derivational
elements. It creates an monovalent verb that denotes a typical activity connected with the
entity denoted by the noun:
(177)in
roya:-ti’
1intr house-VBZ
‘I build a house.’(178)in
sutulra:-ti’
1intr armadillo-VBZ
‘I hunt armadillo.’Like any other verb, the denominal verbs derived by the suffix -ti’ can receive additional verb
morphology. However, as is also the case with most monovalent voice suffixes, the suffix -ti’
is omitted before another suffix is attached (cf. 8.7.1 and 11.5). The meaning of the base
remains the same as when it contains the verbal suffix -ti’. Consider first the examples in
(179) of the nominalizing suffix -wa (cf. (176)) attached to the bases in (177) and (178)
above:
(179)a. n-as
roya:-wa
b. n-as
sutulra:-wa
obl-ART.n house-NMZ
obl-ART.n armadillo-NMZ
‘when I build a house’
‘when I hunted armadillo’
* ’when I am a house’
* ‘when I am an armadillo’Here, the bases ro:ya- and sutulra- are not nouns, but the verbal bases ‘build a house’ and
‘hunt armadillo’, respectively, whose suffix -ti’ is omitted before further suffixation. When
nominal bases occur independently as a predicate, they denotes the state of ‘being X’ (cf. also
(173) above):110(180)a. a’ko
ro:ya
PRO.n house
‘That is a house.’
* ‘That builds a house.’b. a’ko
sutulra
PRO.n armadillo
‘That is an armadillo.’
* ‘That hunts armadillo.’Consider also the following examples of the base ro:ya:ti’ ‘build a house’, reduced to ro:ya-,
with other verbal suffixes: causative in (181), benefactive in (182), and agent-nominalizing in
(183).

‘He is a house-builder.’{HR 14, 145a}Thus, even though they seem to be superficially compatible with nominal bases, the suffixes
in (170) identify a base as verbal.52
An interesting case of words which are considered verbs from the semantic point of view,
but which are morphologically nouns, concerns the words jankwa ‘say’ and jampa ‘do like’.
One indication that these are rather nouns than verbs is that, when nominalized, they first
undergo verbalization by -ni ‘PRC’:
(184)n-os
jankwa-ni:-wa

‘when I said …’The status of these words will be discussed in more detail in 8.5.2.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"
"427However, verbs with -ka are different from other nominalized forms in that it is not clear
how the first person singular is encoded on a monovalent verb marked by -ka . The
expectation would be that the first person is encoded like a possessor, i.e. by the bound
pronoun from Set 1, i , instead of the Set 2 pronoun in. However, speakers are not certain
about this. The forms are used interchangeably, and often, the Set 2 pronoun is used
spontaneously. This was done independently by two speakers in the following example. The
clause in (6)a contains the form of Set 2, in, (6)b contains the form of Set 1, i :

(7)*i
1loj-a-’oj-ka
n-is
do’we
wash-DR-BE.clothes-IM
obl-ART.pl clothes{EA 8, 136o}The problem of how the first person is expressed in a clause that contains a verb with -ka
cannot be solved here. This is especially the case since there are no text examples of a verb
with -ka which has an overtly expressed first person singular argument. However, the free
alternation between in and i is not found in canonical cases of nominalization. To analyse
-ka as a nominalizing suffix, therefore, would not be fully adequate.10.1.2. -ka on voice-marked bases: ‘immediative’
Another peculiarity of the suffix -ka is that it has two very different meanings, depending on
the base it is attached to. On bases that contain voice marking, as described in 8.7, -ka
indicates that the event denoted by the verb takes place or starts earlier than normal; I will
refer to this meaning as “immediative”. On unmarked bivalent roots, which can usually not
serve as a base for further suffixation, however, it indicates that the action cannot be carried
out; I will call this function of -ka “impossibilitive”. I will here describe the immediative
function and turn to the impossibilitive function in 10.1.3.
When -ka is attached to a verbal base of the type described in 8.7, it is usually translated by
the speakers as “at once” or “early”. Most often, the suffix occurs on roots that denote
directed motion, as is illustrated by (8)–(10):

{EA, Huevo 012}As could be seen in (4) above, -ka also occurs on bivalent bases. The following example
shows the two forms in which a bivalent base with the direct marker -na can occur (cf. 8.1.1):
the suffix -na can either be retained (cf. (12)a) or it can be replaced by CV-reduplication (cf.
(12)b).

‘I pulled out the manioc plant early today.’{JM 18, 274}There is no example of -ka on an inverse base.10.1.3. -ka on bivalent roots: ‘impossibilitive’
Unlike most other suffixes, the suffix -ka can be attached to a bivalent root that is unmarked
for voice. Recall from 8.1.5 that a bivalent root without a voice marker denotes a resultative
state. On an unmarked bivalent root, -ka indicates that the event denoted by the verb root
cannot be carried out. Usually, but not necessarily, the verb is preceded by the negative
particle kas (cf. 12.5.1). Consider the following examples, elicited from different speakers:
(13)ra -ka -a=as
tear-IM-LV=n.a

kas tol-ka -a=a

‘It can’t be touched.’ [e.g., because it has spines]{HR 15, 098a}{JM 17, 052}The following example illustrates the contrast between a bivalent root with a direct voice
marker, where the suffix -ka has the “immediative” meaning (cf. (16)a), and a verb in which
the same root occurs without a voice marker, so that the suffix -ka adds the “impossibilitive”
meaning (cf. (16)b). According to the voice properties of the verb, in the direct transitive
clause in (16)a the actor is expressed as ARG1, and in the intransitive clause in (16)b, the only
core argument represents the undergoer.

Complex bases (cf. 8.4) also participate in the contrast between the immediative and the
impossibilitive meaning of -ka .240 This contrast is shown in (17), where a verb with the
applicative suffix - e ‘CO’ is combined with the suffix -ka . In (17)a, the base is marked as
bivalent direct by the voice marker -a. Here, -ka indicates that the event took place
immediately. In (17)b, in contrast, the base is unmarked for voice. On this base, the suffix -ka
indicates impossibility, as is confirmed by the particle kas.

The examples in (18) illustrate the same contrast between the “immediative” and the
“impossibilitive” reading of -ka with a complex verb containing an incorporated modifier
(-Ce ‘person’).

a resultative state.","[450, 451, 452, 453]"
"Questions and answersAs was described in 2.8.5, a question is marked by a particular intonation pattern: in a yes/noquestion, the antepenultimate syllable carries stress and high tone. When the penultimate
syllable is heavy (i.e., closed or long), stress and high tone are on the penultimate syllable. In
a content question, the highest tone is on the first syllable and is lowered towards the end of
the utterance.
A yes/no question is exclusively marked by intonation, whereas a content question can, in
addition, contain a question word (cf. 3.10.6):

{AH, EA&AH 129}However, the question word is not an obligatory marker of an interrogative sentence. Often,
the focus of the question is implied, the only question marker being intonation (indicated here313by an accent). For example, the word kemara ‘use of’ frequently occurs as the predicate of an
interrogative clause (marked by intonation), as in (241). However, that it is not a question
word can be seen in (242), where it occurs in a declarative clause, and in (243), where it is
preceded by a question word.

"These variants are illustrated in (95). Notice that there are two examples of H-reduplication:

(93)a, the plural bound pronoun refers to the bees and in (93)b to the honey (a mass noun, cf. 4.7.2).",[113]
"301There are indications that the position of the word that denotes the more time-stable concept
is semantically determined. In (183) and (185), this can be seen in the main clause, and in
(184) and (186), it can be seen in the relative clause. According to the contexts and intonation
patterns of the examples, it seems that a relative clause has a restrictive function when it
contains a word that denotes a less time-stable concept than the word that functions as the
head. In contrast, when the word that denotes the more time-stable concept is the predicate of
the relative clause, the relative clause is non-restrictive. Thus, in (183), the relative clause
restricts the main clause NP is juyeni ‘people’ to referents which are white and rich. In (185),
the relative clause indicates that the group of children referred to is restricted to clean
children. In contrast, in (184) and (186), there is no indication of a restrictive function of the
relative clause: in (184), the grandparents have been introduced in the preceding discourse,
and in (186), water is the discourse topic, so that there is no reason to assume that the dirty
stuff one is drinking is water as opposed to something else. In cases like these, the relative
construction is a case of non-restrictive modification, the modified noun functioning as the
predicate of the relative clause.
The following examples are a further illustration of the semantic function of the position of
the content words. Here, the verb kayni ‘die’ belongs to the relative clause in (187) and to the
main-clause NP in (188). In (187), the relative clause has a restrictive function: of the
different aunts, the one who has died is the topic. In contrast, the construction in (188), us
kayni di’ (‘the dead one who’), is a common way to refer to deceased people.

{EA, Antojos I 002}As was mentioned in 7.9.5 above, a relative clause with an oblique NP can serve to focus on
the possessor of an entity. No distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is
made here, as the following examples show. The noun in (190) is alienably possessed and the
noun in (191) is inalienably possessed:302(190)(191)oso’

[lit.: “in a bedroom which were of her”]
{EA, Alojamiento 010}The relativized NP always constitutes the absolutive argument of the relative clause, and it is
never overtly present in the relative clause. In the above examples, the relative clauses contain
an intransitive predicate, so that the preceding NP is automatically interpreted as ARGintr.
When the relative clause is transitive, the grammatical status of the relativized NP is indicated
by the voice marker on the verb.
This is illustrated in the following examples. The relativized NP, absent in the relative
clause itself, is underlined. In (192)–(194), the verb is marked as direct, which means that the
head NP is the undergoer in the relative clause (cf. 8.1.1):

{JM, Perro II 040}In (195) and (196), the verb is marked as inverse. This indicates that the head is the actor in
the relative clause (cf. 8.1.2):

[or: “We were paid by that man by whom we were spoken to.”] {EA, Cbba 056}Another way to encode the head as the actor of a direct-marked verb, in the same way as with
independent clauses, is to insert the focus particle kaw (cf. 7.8) into the relative clause:

an exception:

ART.pl dog
REL bite-DR=pl.a
‘the dogs that bit [it]’{EA, Tigre y perro 007}In most cases, it is the absolutive argument of the main clause that is modified by a relative
clause. This could be seen in (185), (194), and (196) above, where the main clauses are
transitive, and the relative clause modifies the absolutive argument. Relativization of ARG1,
in contrast, is rare. Consider the following example:
(200)jiwa- e-na=is
juyeni

main-clause NP or the (omitted) subject of the preceding relative clause. In (202), for
example, the second relative clause modifies the preceding one and not directly the mainclause absolutive NP, because this would not make sense. In (203), both types occur: the first
relative clause, containing an adverbial phrase, modifies the main-clause NP, while the
subsequent three relative clauses modify the first relative clause.

{EA, Parabas 052}Subordinate clauses7.12.1. General characteristis of subordinate clauses
In most subordinate clauses in Movima, the predicate is transformed into an action noun (cf.
11.1) and forms part of an NP. Since it is an NP, the subordinate clause can either be a
complement, i.e. a core argument of the clause (cf. 7.12.2), or an adjunct, i.e. an oblique
argument (cf. 7.12.3).
Since a main-clause predicate can consist of a verb as well as of a noun, both these word
classes undergo nominalization when they function as the predicate of a subordinate clause. A
verb is nominalized by the suffix -wa, as shown in (11). A predicate nominal in a subordinate
clause is modified by infixing reduplication, as in (12). For a more detailed description of
these types of nominalization, see 11.1.

‘when I was a girl’177I.e., Yuracaré Indians305The predicate of a subordinate clause is a relational noun (i.e., obligatorily possessed; cf. Ch.
6). This implies that, unlike in main clauses, the intransitive argument in a subordinate clause
is encoded in the same way as ARG1. Consider the encoding of the second person in the main
clause in (13)a, by the pronoun of Set 2, with its encoding in the subordinate clause (a noun
phrase) in (13)b, by the internal clitic of Set 1:178

way as in the main clause. This can be seen in the main and subordinate direct transitive
clause in (204)a and b and in the main and subordinate inverse transitive clause in (14)a and

‘so that X looks for you’The fact that not only a nominalized bivalent, but also a nominalized monovalent predicate in
a subordinate clause is possessed, implies that the ergativity split found in affirmative main
clauses (cf. 7.5.3) is reversed. The argument of the intransitive clause (in (13)b, the bound
pronoun =n) is encoded in the same way as the actor in the nominalized direct clause (cf.
(204)b) and as the undergoer in the inverse clause (cf. (14)b).180178Likewise, the nominalized forms in (11) and (12), unmarked for person, imply the first person singular.
On nominalized verbs, the direct marker -na and the inverse marker -kay are replaced by CV~ and CVC~,
respectively; cf. 8.7.2.
180
The same phenomenon can be observed in negative main clauses, which also involve nominalization (cf.
7.15).
179306Table 24. The ergativity split in subordinate clauses
ARG1

‘I want to visit my relative.’ [lit.: “I want my visiting my relative.”] {EA, Visita 047}A monovalent nominalized verb, in contrast, even though it resembles a bivalent verb in that
its argument is encoded like the transitive ARG1, remains monovalent. This can be seen from
the fact that they can only be combined with an oblique NP:
(206)yey-na os

‘I wanted to learn how to play [the harmonica].’ [lit.: “I want my-past knowing of
my-past playing.”]
{EA, Organ 013}Multiple subordination, as in (206), is common. In (206), the main verb yeyna ‘want’ is
followed by a complement containing a nominalized verb (bispani:wa) which again is
followed by an adjunct containing a nominalized verb (javu na:wa ‘my playing’). More
examples will be seen below.
It can be observed from the translation in (206) that subordination in Movima has an
unusual property: tense as encoded in the subordinate clause indicates tense of the main
clause. This is a consequence of the fact that a subordinate clause is formally an NP, and that
the article, which marks an NP, obligatorily indicates temporal properties of the referent (cf.
4.8.2, Haude 2004). Since the article is the most regular device of indicating tense, tensemarking particles not being frequent in texts, this means that the temporal properties indicated
for the nominalized form in the subordinate clause are also implied for the main clause. Thus,
in (206), even though only the NPs are marked by the article for ceased existence of their
referents (the events denoted by the nominalized predicates), the main-clause predicate (yeyna
‘want’) is understood as referring to a past-tense event. Likewise, since in (205), the
subordinate NP contains the presential article, it is understood that the main-clause predicate
(again yeyna ‘want’) refers to a non-past event.
The following sections describe the two main types of subordinate clauses formed by
nominalization: complement clauses, which constitute a core argument of the main-clause
predicate, and adverbial clauses (or adjuncts), which constitute an oblique argument of the307main-clause predicate. In Chapter 12, the different types of subordinate clauses introduced by
clause-combining particles will be described.","[324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331]"
"476examples, or as the predicate of a relative clause, as in (35).
When a noun with -pa functions as the predicate of a subordinate clause or a clause with the
negative particle kas, it undergoes infixing reduplication, as in (40) (cf. 11.1.1). This
identifies the word derived through -pa as a morphological noun; if it were a verb, it would
receive the suffix -wa in this construction (cf. 11.1.1, 3.10).
When a bivalent base is combined with the agent nominalizer -pa, the resulting noun
denotes a place. This can be seen in the following examples, where the bases are marked as
bivalent by the base-final direct voice marker -a or -na (cf. 8.1.1):

{BA, TX 287}It seems that a locational noun derived through -pa denotes a place where a situation occurs
once, not habitually. This is in contrast to the locational suffix -kwi (or -pi) on bivalent bases
(cf. 9.5) and the direct voice marker -na on monovalent bases (cf. 8.1.1, 8.3.2). These suffixes
imply that the situation habitually occurs at that place. The contrast is illustrated by the
translations of (44)a and b. In (44)a, a verb is marked as a locative expression by the suffix -pi
‘LOC’ (cf. 9.5), which implies that the event occurs habitually. In (44)b, in contrast, the verb
is combined with the suffix -pa, and this implies that the action occured only once. Note also
that when the form with -pa denotes a location where the action is carried out habitually, it is
often accompanied by the habitual particle chon, as in (41) above. This is a further indication
that the idea of habituality is not implied in the locational meaning of -pa.

-maj (cf. 11.6). In (46)b, this form receives the bound root -poy ‘animal’ and refers to animals

Instrument nominalization is a more complex process. In this section, I will first describe the
forms and functions of the suffix that creates an instrumental noun, then the bases to which
this suffix can be attached, and finally, I will illustrate the lexicalized and idiomatic uses of
instrumental nouns.","[499, 500, 501]"
"Aspiration of /s/ and / /The phoneme /s/ can be realized as [h] in coda position. This only concerns the final
consonant of the articles (cf. 4.4), shown in (110)a for the article /as/, and of the negative

the proclitic occurs before a relational noun (cf. Ch. 6) or before a bivalent verb. These cases
are illustrated by (113) and (114), respectively. In both cases, the first person is implicit and

{EA 8, 019r}The particle loy is not an obligatory marker of future tense. This can be seen from the fact that
when there is an additional indicator of future, such as the adverbial clause in (139), the
particle loy is not obligatory. The following is a perfectly acceptable alternative to the
utterance in (139) above:

homophonous particle, which only occurs in relative clauses and subordinate clauses (i.e.,
NPs with nominalized predicates), where it serves as a negator (cf. 12.5.2 below). It is not
clear whether these two particles are related.12.3.3. joy(ka) ‘speculative’

{EA, Summary 020}The particle joy is often combined with other modal particles, for example with choy
‘certainly’, which indicates a higher degree of certainty on the part of the speaker (cf. 12.3.4
below).
Often, joy is part of a conditional clause introduced by di’ (cf. 12.1.5 above):

‘Whether it [the corral] is already torn down, or whether it is still standing, that’s

{EG, Dial. 103}The combination of joy and di’ in the opposite order is a lexicalized expression, ‘I don’t

‘I don’t know, I said. I don’t know if we should let it go.’ {EA, Jaguar 054}12.3.4. choy ‘certainly’
The particle choy indicates that the speaker is certain of the truth of the statement. This
particle never appears alone, but is either preceded by the speculative particle joy (cf. 12.3.3)
or followed by rey (cf. 12.3.1), or it occurs between these particles. In combination with joy, it
indicates that the speaker does not know for sure, but assumes that what s/he is saying is true.
This can be seen in the following examples:
(147)(148)528che joy choy
ji:yi--’ne

‘And she must have cried.’{EA, Escape Marivel 042}joy choy

‘My earrings must have got caught in my hair [because I lost one].’ {EA, Aros 037}Possibly, the combination of these two particles is best seen as a single form, joychoy. This is
suggested by the following example, where the ending -ka, which creates the long form of
many particles, is added to this sequence:

‘They smeared (it) with what seemed like a syrup, tar probably.’ {EA, Parabas 019}When choy is followed (in very few cases, preceded) by rey (cf. 12.3.1 above), this
combination is best translated as ‘of course’. It is often used as an interjection when listening
to someone, as in (152).270

The particle di’, homophonous with the (possibly related) relativizer (cf. 7.11), is used when a
hypothetical situation is evoked, regardless of whether the situation really takes place or not.
The hypothetical particle can be distinguished from the relativizer by the fact that it does not

"3.7.5. Marking of inalienable adnominal possession
Infixing reduplication also productively marks inalienable possession on nouns (cf. 6.4.1):

chuydi
ART.pl syrup-<INAL~>BR.liquid=ART.pl bee
‘the honey of the bees’This is the case except when the predicate contains a negative morpheme.",[112]
"Morphological characteristics of adjectivesThe argument that all adjectives (nounlike and verblike) belong to the morphological class of
nouns is based on the fact that, unlike verbs, they can be combined with the nominal
derivational morphemes listed in (174) above. Most importantly, nominalization of a
predicative adjective, as of a predicative noun, is carried out by infixing reduplication. In
(207), this is shown for the nounlike, and in (208), for the verblike adjectives:
(207)a. n-os
me<re~>dek-a=a
obl-ART.n.p big<NMZ.N~>-LV=n
‘when it was big’
b. n-as
bi<ja:~>jaw

‘when I am old’(208)a. n-as

obl-ART.n hard-<NMZ.N~>BE.breath
‘when I am strong’
b. kas kaw-ye<me~>mes-a=as
NEG much-BE.day<NMZ.N~>-LV=n.a
‘It (was) not (for) many days.’However, some morphological differences between nouns and adjectives can be discerned.
While the other nominal morphemes in (174) can, in principle, be attached to both nouns and
adjectives, their productivity varies according to the type of base they are attached to. The
verbalizing suffix -ti’, which is very productive on nouns, applies only to a limited degree to
adjectives. Moreover, the resulting verb seems to be more idiomatic:
(209)rapal-ti’
red-VBZ
‘to prepare a red dye’117(210)bijaw-ti’
old-VBZ
‘to make an old person (e.g. a doll by dressing it)’;
~ ‘to get oneself an old man/woman’In contrast, the verbalizing suffix -ni, which typically indicates a process, is far more
productively combined with an adjective than with a noun. On some adjectives, it literally
indicates a process, as on nouns (cf. 11.9.1). Compare the similar function of -ni on nouns
((211)a) and on adjectives ((211)b). Other adjectives always take the suffix -ni, and its
addition does not create a meaning difference; cases of this type are shown in (212), and the
similarity in meaning is illustrated by (213)a and b.

{EA, Motacu 034}Thus, while adjectives can be combined with all nominal morphemes, these morphemes can
have a different degree of productivity depending on the type of base they are attached to.
This can probably be attributed to semantic differences between the two classes.
The point in which adjectives diverge most from nouns is that predicative adjectives are
often combined with a special nominalizing suffix - e in negative clauses, instead of
undergoing infixing reduplication (cf. (207), (208) above):118(214)a. di:ra

‘This isn’t much yet.’{EA 19, 284}On “real” nouns, this suffix does usally not occur spontaneously, even though this is, in
principle, possible (cf. also 11.1):
(215)a. kas
NEGsi<ba~>ba=a
frog<NMZ.N~>=n~ b. kas
siba- e=a

frog-NMZ.N=n
‘It’s not a frog.’{JM 18, 041}In contrast, on adjectives in negative clauses, the suffix - e often occurs spontaneously, as
illustrated by the following text examples:
(216)(217)(218)kas
jayaw- e=as
NEG nice-NMZ.N=n.a
‘It’s not nice.’

or
HYP SPC NEG good-NMZ.N=f
‘… [to find out] whether she is good or whether she is not good.’
{EA, Palomajna 004}Thus, also where morphology is concerned, adjectives can be considered nouns. There are,
however, tendencies which show that they have a special status within that word class: the
productivity with which they can be combined with certain nominal morphemes, as well as
the semantic effect of that combination, can differ from that of nouns.
So far, I have considered nounlike and verblike adjectives together. In the following
section, similarities and differences between verblike adjectives and verbs will be discussed.","[140, 141, 142]"

The particle jan introduces an adverbial clause, which is formally an oblique NP (cf. 7.12.3).
The special property of this construction is that the predicate of the adverbial clause is not
nominalized through -wa or reduplication (cf. 11.1.1), but through a suffix -na, which only
occurs in this particular construction (cf. 11.1.3). Consider the following example:

influence the meaning.

The particle o:be precedes an NP or a pronoun which denotes an entity with which another
entity is compared. Unlike the subordinating particles described above (e.g. bo ‘so that’), the
NP preceded by o:be typically contains not a nominalized predicate, but an ordinary noun.
This particle is therefore best described as a preposition.
In (42), o:be introduces a noun phrase, in (43) a free pronoun, and in (44) a demonstrative
(underlined):

clause qualifies the predicate of the preceding clause (tivijniwa ‘hurting’), which is itself an
adverbial clause of the type described in 7.12.3.

{EA, Lagartija 021f.}Tense and aspect particlesIt is not easy to distinguish the categories tense, aspect and mood as indicated by particles.
Temporal and aspectual categories are difficult to distinguish, and some particles with an
aspectual function can also be used as markers of mood. Therefore, I subsume tense and
aspect particles under one heading, and some of them will be described again in the section on
modal and epistemic particles (12.3).
The position of the TAM-particles in the clause, and the relation between their position and
their scope, requires further research. It seems that in principle, a particle can occur at any
position in the clause:
(46)(TAM) TOP (TAM) PRED (TAM) ARG (TAM)Strikingly, these particles occur very often within an NP, i.e., between the article and the
noun:
(47)ART (TAM) NIn the following sections, I will indicate for each particle whether it can occur within an NP.
Further research is needed to establish the frequency of certain particles in that position, and
what this means for their scope properties.
Many TAM-particles have a long form with the ending -ka. This form usually occurs at the
margins of the clause. The existence of a long form will also be indicated for each particle
individually.","[529, 530, 531, 532, 533]"
