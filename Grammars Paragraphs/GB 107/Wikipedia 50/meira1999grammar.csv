functional homogeneity,together with certain peculiarities (e.g. the distinction betweennominal and verbal negation), argue in favor of a separate treatment.
Negation can be of the following kinds:— lexical: that is the case of negative adverbializing and nominalizing affixes such
as i- -nna, i- -mi(ni)‘not having’, I- -:ra, i- -pi(ni)‘having an inefficient N’, etc. (cf.","[576, 577]"

are close to the English word ‘yes’ and ‘no’, but they are not entirely equivalent, since the

‘no’ in English (ie. aha agrees, and owa

take, besides noun phrases (69a; 69c has a nominalized verb form), also adverbs (69d-f)
and postpositional phrases (69f-h, m) within its scope. Notice that _ta(ike) can be used for

which puts it closer to adverbs (cf. 5.4.3.1.1, 10.4.1.2.2, 10.4.1.3.3). Curiously enough, the558
habitual past, very similar in form (and historically related) to the supine, does not take
_ta(ike); rather, the normal negative form in -sewa occurs with a habitual meaning (70b-c)(cf. Meira 1998a:120ff, L36ff for a hypothesis on the historical development of the negativeand habitual past forms from the supine). The remote past is also negated with _ta(ike)

(cf. 5.4.3.1.3): in order to say ‘I don’t kill birds’, Tiriyé speakers use ‘I am birds not-killing’
(71a-f). Like the habitual past, the negative form follows a nominative pattern of person
marking, in that the O participant can occur as a person prefix on the negated verb stemwhile the A and S participants must be either noun phrases or person prefixes on the copula559e(i). There is some evidence that a preverbal O noun phrase forms a verb phrase with the
verb, but the data are scant (cf. 10.2.2). The optional occurrence of the copula makes the
negative clause look structurally different from the habitual past; a further difference is theidiosyncratic third-person O prefix im-, which does not occur on habitual past forms (71b).","[577, 578, 579, 580]"

In some Cariban languages (e.g. Panare[Gildea, pers.;comm.], Akawayo[DesreyFox, pers. comm.]), copular sentences with two noun phrases are impossible: one of them
has to be adverbialized,usually with a cognateof the postposition _me(described in7.3.4.3). In Tirly6, however, two-NP copular clauses are perfectly acceptable (58d, 59b).
Combiningthis with the possibility of leaving off the copula (i.e. of forming equativeclauses), it becomes possible to translate ‘my father is a shaman’ in four ways (59). Some
speakers have said that (59d) sounds ‘more definite’ (i.e. like an identification or equation:
‘my father is the shaman’); aside from that, the semantic distinctions betweenthe variouspossibilities in (59) are not well understood.""(59a)(c)pahko_n-aipijai_mepahko_n-aipijai1:father_3S,4-Cop shaman_AttrI:father_3S,-Copshaman‘My father is a shaman.’“My father is a shaman.’pahkopijai_mel:fathershaman_Attr(b)(d)pahkopijai1:father shaman“My father is a shaman.’“My father is a shaman.’10.3.2.2.

also copular/equative, one wonders if Tiriy6 should be seen as a language in which the expression of ‘verbal
states’ implies copular/equative predications. Unlike English, in which the suppression of one of the
arguments‘stative’suffices(‘he hunts’,‘this booksituations and copular predicationsells well’),Tiriy6seemsto reservefor more ‘stative’ or ‘modal’

"2.5.2. Intonation. Research on the various intonational patterns of Tiriyé is still ongoing.
The following patterns have already been identified:
(a) Unmarked affirmative intonation. Throughout a non-final intonational phrase,
pitch starts low and rises towards the end; on the last intonational phrase, pitch starts high
and falls towards the end. (39) is a schematic illustration; Fig. 2.10 contains the actual

cases of adverbs negated with _ta(ike) are lexicalizing (cf. (33f), in which kawé_ta ‘not
tall’ = ‘short’ can be nominalized with -no [cf. 4.2.2.2]), but this is not generally true (cf.
(33g), in which pija_ta ‘not small’ cannot be nominalized). _Taike is also used to negatethe -se forms of the verb,. the supine (33k) and the remote past (331) (but not, of course,

“spend the night’ in 5.3.3.2.1 below), it appears that a better understanding of the situation
will have to wait for further comparative research.
From the semantic viewpoint, there are certain tantalizing similarities between the
transitive and intransitive verbalizers. All of them concern the relationship between one of
the participants of the derived verb stem (O or S) and the source noun (N), in a ‘negative’
(‘depriving’, ‘ceasing’) or ‘positive’ (‘giving’, ‘having/getting’) manner. If the parallelisms
were perfect, one might say that the transitive verbalizers are close to being causativeversions of the intransitive verbalizers: the ‘positive’ beneficiative suffixes -hté/-nté and
-pa/-mawouldsuffixes-ta/-nadescribe the action of ‘giving N to O’, while the ‘positive’
(-wa)and‘producing/getting N’; the-pa(mi)/-ma(mi)‘negative’wouldcorrespondtotheprivative suffix -ka would indicateinchoative
eventofthe action of‘taking N away from O’, while the ‘negative’ cessative -ke(pi) would express the idea of
‘losing N’, ‘not having N anymore’. There are, however, details which deviate from this
parallelism:
meaning-ke(pi),doesnotfor instance,is muchreally‘beingimplyless productivedeprived’ason nounsmuchasthan‘ceasing-ka, and its

distinction between-ta/-naand -pa(mi)/-ma(mi)roughlycorrelateswiththe distinctionbetween -hté/-nté and -pa/-ma (e.g. both -pa/-ma and -pa(mi)/-ma(mi) occur on ‘more
abstract’nounrootslike emu(ku)‘sadness’,akunu‘laziness’,etc.,while-ta/-naandhté/-nté occur on ‘more concrete’ roots), the overlap is imperfect at best (e.g. nmuu-ma‘impregnate O’, from nmuku‘son’, corresponds not to *nmuh-pa(mi), but to nmubh-ta,270
‘have, give birth to a son’). Although Table5.8 still lookssuggestive,and mayhaveconsequences for diachronic studies, it seems that, in present-day Tiriyd, the exact process
used to verbalize a noun root is, to a large extent, an idiosyncratic lexical matter.","[289, 290, 291]"

-:me (with an exceptional third-person prefix in- [imi- if the stem starts with a consonant

“Well, “all right,” she said, “all right,” but it wasn’t really all right (lit. it was
little good) to mother.’? One possibility would be to see it as a negative form of ap&(i) ‘catch’, the k- being the 1+20 person
marker (cf. 5.4.1.1.1); the etymological meaning would be ‘not catching us’ > ‘but’. However, the transitivestem apé(i) is I-reducing, which means that it should take the -sewa allomorph of the negative suffix. In
fact, ‘not catching us’ is synchronically k-épéé-sewa, not *k-tpé-ewa. If képéewa

"Tikuijecompared to verb stems like kuita ‘to be dirty’ or kuima ‘to make O‘dirty’canbedirty’ (cf. 5.3.3.2.1,5.3.3.1.2 for the verbalizers -ta and -ma), tipokine ‘smelly’ with the verb stem pokinta
‘to smell O’, and tiponje ‘tasty’ with the negative ipoinna‘insipid, tasteless’.? For theremaining monomorphemic t-adverbs, no other traces of the stem were found.
The negative adverbs show clear signs of negative adverbializers (cf. 6.2.1.2 for
i- -nna ‘privative’, i- -:ra ‘inefficient’, ‘negative’) or particles (cf. 9.1.4 for the negative
_ta(ike)). As was pointed out above, isunna and ipoinnawith other adverbs
(inanimate)’has(suume‘sweet’, tiponjea nominalized‘insipid, tasteless’ share a stem‘tasty’). Theform iijanta (iijanonpétaadverbiijeeta‘many,a lotwith the past -npé)whichclearly identifies ta as an independent element;'° however, *jije or *iijan cannot be used
° The stem seems to be po(n) in tiponje and poi in ipoinna. This can be explained by assuming that thestem was *poi, and that tiponje (pronounced [ti.po'p.pe]} is the result of palatalization (/Vin/ > [V'n)),which, in accordance with the analysis of the sequence ['p] (cf. 2.4.2.1), is reinterpreted as /nj/. In this case,
the adverbializer would be t--ne, not t- -je: *tipoine > tiponje. Notice that the sequence /in/ does not
automatically result in [‘p] (e.g. weine ‘I was’ [vei.ne], apéine ‘catcher, one who catches (it)’) ([a_poi.ne],
etc.), but cases such as tiponje (and maybe also ponjeke ‘collared peccary’; cf. Apalaf poinoko, Wayana
péinéké) suggest that this may have been the case at an earlier stage. Another possibility is that *poi may
have come from *pojV, so that it really was *poj, with a final consonant, and that the sequence *jn, but not
the sequence *in, underwent palatization (the verb stems ei ‘copula’ and apéi ‘catch’, from which weineand apéine derive, are reflexes of *eci and *apéci [cf. Meira 1998:165, 183], i.e. their i was not a glide).",[377]

"A still (but not so clearly) related meaning of this verb is that of ‘imitating’: taripi
wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a taripi, a capuchin monkey’, said someone who was
about to entertain his friends by mimicking a Cebus apella. This can be said about people
as well: waijana wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate a Wayana’, and also, waijana i-jomi
wi-kuu-ja-e ‘I am going to imitate the Wayana language’. Interestingly, the Tiriy6é always
use the verb ku(ku) to refer to the capacity of speaking a foreign language; it is as thoughthe only language that one really speaks is one’s own mother tongue, while all the other
languages that one might know are ‘imitated’, no matter how well or fluently. Waijana i-602
jomi mi-kuu-ja-n ? ‘do you speak the Wayana language?’, a Tiriy6 may ask one of his
friends. I-kuh-ké_pité ! ‘imitate it a little bit!’, i.e. ‘speak some of it (so that we can hear
what it sounds like)’, he say after an affirmative answer: the Tiriy6, like most Amerindiangroups, are often curious about the languages of other people.

meanings of ku(ku).","[622, 623]"

"Several occurrences of i- -:ra with @-nominalized verb stems were attested (e.g.
(20a-b)). The meaning is that of an O-oriented negative potential adverb (‘cannot be Ved’, ‘in-V-able’), the opposite of the meaning that non-possessed @-nominalizations have
when followed by the attributivizer postposition _me (cf. 7.3.4.3). This meaning is quiteclose to that of i- -poora. The difference seems to lie in the degree of specificity of the Aparticipant: while i- -:ra has a generic A, i- -poora has a more readily identifiable one.

clause is a copular clause from which the copula is missing. This seems even more clearly
so for negative sentences, in which the semantics is apparently the same with or without the
copula (55a-b).(55a)in-enee-wawi3Neg-see-Neg|‘I don’t see him/her/it.’(b)in-enee-wa_w-a-e3Neg-see-Neg_1S,-Cop-Cty

can be said about the participial or -se forms (cf. 5.4.3.1.3), including the negative form
(the negative marker -sewa only occurs on verbs; the particle _ta(ike)[cf. 9.1.4] is usedwith other lexical classes). These morphological properties are so salient that there can be
no doubts about the status of a given stem. Although there are, as could be expected, lessand more prototypical verbs, the difference between them lies in details (for instance,
certain verbs are semantically incompatible with speech act participants and thus can only
be conjugated in the third person: e.g. ahta ‘to drip’, kaarapa(mi) ‘to ferment’, etc.), or in
how regular they are (cf. e.g. 5.4.4 on the forms of the copula ei).
The verbal class, as defined by these morphological properties, corresponds
accurately to the expected set of ‘less time-stable’ concepts (cf. Givén’svery1984:51ff). Mostof the expected notions are found in this class. One notable, but not surprising, exception is
that of the‘experiencer’predicates:‘want’,‘believe’,‘hate’,‘know’,‘notknow’,‘beafraid’ etc. are postpositions, not verbs (cf. 7.3.3). The following list is a sample of verb
stems, including transitive (la-f) and intrasitive (Sq: 1g-j, So: 1k-o) stems. To differentiate
transitive fromintransitiveverbs,the glossesof the formerwillincludean O,makingreference to the existence of an O participant. (For the [t] in [t]wé ‘to shoot’, cf. 5.1.3).","[245, 246]"
"5.1.3. T-adding stems. Certain verb stems have an unexpected prefix t- (ti-, if they are
consonant-initial) in the following forms, without any change in meaning:(a) nominalized forms without a preceding possessor (cf. 4.2.2.1);
(b) second-person imperative forms without a preceding object (cf. 5.4.2.1);
(c) third-person (prefixless) hypothetical forms (with the suffix -i; cf. 5.4.1.3.5);?(d) supine (cf. 5.4.3.1.1) and indefinite negative (cf. 5.4.3.1.3) forms.*3 Presumably, the same is true for the other non-factual forms (e.g. the incredulitive and admonitive forms),
but the necessary examples did not occur in the available corpus.",[251]
"'S The speaker had this word translated as ‘baby, small child’. It looks like a combination of the particleswa(a) ‘Negative’ and nkéré ‘still, yet’ (cf. 9.1.4): it could be a case of lexicalization (‘still-not-existing’ >

available for the habitual past; presumably, it is controlled by the A/S participants, as in
negative clauses (cf. next section). An overt O noun phrase, if present, was obligatorily
placed before the verb, apparently forming a verb phrase (cf. the placement of the secondposition particle _pité ‘a second, temporarily’after the verb in (68b)).

isunna ‘insipid’, and the tahpa in tahpame ‘sitting’ is also found in the verb e-tahpa-ka‘to sit down’). In one case, a possible cognate stem has been found in a related language:
compare tapiime ‘many (animate beings)’ with Apalaf tapii ‘house’ (spelled tapyi; cf.

The possessible deverbal nominalizations can occur both as possessors (30b) and as
possessed words (30a, d-e), and even as both (30c). As far as could be ascertained, there isno syntactic difference between possessive phrases based on verbal nominalizations and
those based on monomorphemic nouns (with a special semantic detail: the possessor of the
nominalization must correspond to one of the participants of the event described by the
original verb stem: the A participant in the case of the n- ‘Actual O’ nominalizer, and the O
or S participant for the others; cf. 4.2.2.1). The parenthetical (i-) in the examples below ismeant to indicate that both the N-N and the N i-N possessive phrases were accepted (and
are presumably possible for the others as well).® For the structural problems posed by the
use of nominalizations as the ‘nucleus’ of subordinate clauses, cf. 10.4.(30a)kaikui(i-)pijokf_se_w-a-edog3-hit:N:Pos_Desid_1S,a-Cop-Cty(b)enpa-ne(i-)panpira3:teach-A.act.Nzr 3-book:Pos‘I want to hit the dog.’“The teacher’s book.’(c)i-tati-hpé

In the following sections, various aspects of Tiriyé syntax are examined in detail.
The main formal units (phrases, clauses, sentences, etc.) are dealt with in 10.2-3, while themain semantic units (roles and grammatical relations) are treated in 10.4. A description of
phrase types is given in 10.2, followed by a presentation of the main clause and sentence
types in 10.3 and of complexsentences and subordination in 10.4. A first approach athigher-level problems (coordination, topic, rhneme, and word order) are addressed in 10.4.2
