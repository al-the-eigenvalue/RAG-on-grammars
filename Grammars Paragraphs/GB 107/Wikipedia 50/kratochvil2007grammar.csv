‘true’. Their function is inverted negation. There are two affirmative predicate markers
in Abui: ba and bai (discussed in 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2). Both items are identified as verbs,
because they may combine with person and aspectual inflection. Both markers are
related, in fact they are a grammaticalization of the verb ba ‘say’ which is used when
direct speech is quoted, as illustrated in (222) where the verb ba ‘say’ follows a direct
speech and combines with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC).15

3II.LOC-say[B02.045.16:09]This verb has developed, next to its affirmative functions, also to a relator, complement
marker, and an intersective linker in both nominal and verbal domain (see also 3.5.6
and 4.5).16
6.4.2.1
Affirmative predicate marker ba
The affirmative predicate marker ba ‘say’ affirms the true value of a predicate. Its use is
illustrated in (223). The marker ba ‘say’ indicates that the child that is described as
‘shivering’ in the preceding clause perhaps ‘is’ ill. The first clause expresses the topic of
the predicate, which is expressed in the second clause. Structurally, the construction
reminds of the copula clauses given in section 4.5, example (122).

[B05.060.04]In (224), the marker ba ‘say’ follows the index verb na ‘be like.PRX’. Also this structure
is related to the copula clauses mentioned above. However, as the complement itself is
verbal, the verb ba ‘say’ has acquired the affirmative function.

both conversation turns. One of the participants inquires whether the solicitors ‘will’
start bargaining. One solicitor answers that they ‘do’ intend to do so.
In this function, ba is translated with the Malay verb bilang ‘say’, which is the motivation of the gloss.
Cross-linguistically, copulas may acquire the affirmative function and even develop to a nominalising device
with possible extensions as complementizer or relator (cf. LaPolla, 2007:10).

[B13.012.38:06]In (226), ba ‘say’ occurs twice in the same sentence. The first ba ‘say’ introduces a
conditional clause: naha ba ‘if not’. The second ba ‘say’ indicates that it is true that
there are evil ghosts, if one does not sleep elsewhere.

[B02.126.00:42]The affirmative marker ba ‘say’ often occurs in constructions that report events or
speech that was not witnessed by the addressee. A number of examples are given in
(227). In these constructions, ba ‘say’ follows the VP in the complement clause of the
utterance verb fanga/fangi ‘say, speak, utter’.

[B07.010.02]Note that in (227) the affirmative predicate marker ba ‘say’ is followed by the anaphoric
demonstrative yo (MD.AD). For more details about the use of anaphoric demonstratives
in the clause domain see section 6.4.3. In (228), the speaker reports his dream, in which
he went to the harbour Kalabahi. In the dream reality, the speaker refers to himself as
to his ‘spirit’ and stresses the true value of his dream report with the affirmative marker
ba ‘say’.

Confirmative predicate marker bai
The marker bai confirms the true value of a predicate. The marker bai consists of the
marker ba ‘say’ that is inflected with the perfective suffix -i (PFV). The marker bai is
used to persuade the addressee of true value of the predication. Consider the fragment
in (229). The speaker is requested to shoot with the bow. He complains about the fact
that his arm ‘does’ already hurt.

say-PFV
[B09.002.00:48]In (230), the confirmative marker bai occurs twice. In the second clause, the marker bai
proves its verbal character when it combines with the aspectual marker te (INCP.C). The
first occurrence of the confirmative marker ba-i (say-PFV) indicates the true value of the
clause ‘I just told it to you’. The form bai serves as a copula, as it takes the first clause
as its topic, while the copula complement is expressed by the second clause.

cases, the demonstratives follow the head constituent of an NP or a clause. Their
function is anaphoric (compare the deictic function in 6.3.2). All six anaphoric
demonstratives that occur as adnominal modifier may also combine with a VP (see
3.5.2.2). In (233), an overview of the demonstratives and their functions is given. In the

(section 6.4.3.5)
(section 6.4.3.6)The anaphoric demonstrative indicates the discourse location of the referred event
when it is followed by another phrase or clause. It indicates the location of the event
with respect to the moment of speech (temporal location) when it is the final
constituent of a sentence. Clauses with anaphoric demonstratives as their final
constituent may express complements. The anaphoric demonstrative has nominalising
effect and clearly delimits the domain of a clause. As there are no pivots for crossclause reference, the arguments within the clause delimited with an anaphoric
demonstrative are not necessarily accessible for the pronominal reference of the
following clause (this feature will be illustrated in 6.4.3.1). The use of the anaphoric
demonstratives in different domains is attested also in other Papuan languages
(Reesink, 1994). The anaphoric demonstratives have been analysed as having a domain
creating function and marking different types of constructions.
6.4.3.1
Anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX)
The anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) indicates the temporal location of an event as
proximate to the moment of speech when it is the final constituent of a sentence, such
as in (234). The demonstrative do (PRX) combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ to indicate
that the event of ‘falling’ just occurred.

[B02.104.20:08]ClauseAn Abui clause consists minimally of a predicate and optionally contains also
arguments, adverbial modifiers, and other particles. In this section, I deal only with

1997:282). It marks the value of a predicate as ‘false’ or ‘absent’. Abui clause is negatedVERB PHRASE AND CLAUSE277with the verb naha ‘not be’ (see 6.4.1.1). Further, there are two particles, mainly
associated with the imperative construction: the prohibitive markers he (PRH) and doma
(PRH) are described in section 6.4.1.2. Both particles in fact express illocutionary force
categories, that are in Abui associated with distinct grammatical constructions such as
serial constructions with ng ‘see’ (8.4.2.1) or ì ‘put’ (8.4.2.7), (cf. Dahl, 1999).
6.4.1.1
naha ‘not be/NEG’
Abui clause is negated with the verb naha ‘not be’. The negator follows the negated VP
and is glossed in this use as NEG. In (210), the negator naha follows the verb nee ‘eat’ in
(a) or the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ in (b) negates the whole clause:

[B07.017.05]Multi-verbal predicates such as serial verb constructions are negated such as monoverbal predicates. Shared negation in multi-verbal predicates indicates that they may be
considered as monoclausal structures. In (212), a number of verbs conjoined in a serial
verb construction are negated with naha (NEG) in (a). However, when only a part of
these verbs should be negated, the serial verb construction cannot be maintained.
Instead, as illustrated in (b), two clauses are joined together with the conjunction
marker haba ‘but’. The conjunction marker is followed by an intonational pause,
marked in the example with a comma.

‘he tries to leave (deliberately)’ [B05.045.01]The single participant is realized as an experiencer as free and bound pronoun with

‘reach, attempt’ expresses speaker’s intention to ‘leave’. The use of the inceptive re

[B05.044.05]The continuative ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ indicates an event as being performed in a
persistent way. The single (human) participant is realized as the U argument with the
PAT prefix. Because the speaker mostly expresses his ‘wish’ to perform an activity, the
free pronoun is omitted and the A≡UPAT experiencer construction is alternated, as
illustrated in (212). In both cases the major verb is inflected with perfective suffix -i
(PFV) although the expressed situation must be considered as an instance of irrealis

[B05.044.03]In negative clauses such as in (213), the verb ra ‘reach’ can be the best translated as

interpreted as a verb; however, in (b), the predicate dara does not show person
agreement with the A argument na (1SG). The form functions as an adverbial modifier
(see 6.3).

[B07.075.01]The form dara following inanimate participants reminds us of the adverb ‘still’, and
considering the restrictions on the use of the active pronouns with inanimates, it is
likely that the form dara in (214) is adverbial. It is quite obvious that the semantics of
the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ can be easily extended to an adverbial use.","[438, 439]"

ding kang ‘probably’
The predicate ding kang indicates that an event might possibly occur. In fact the ding

[B07.037.02]The adverbial ding kang possibly originates in a SVC with kang ‘be good’ discussed in
8.4.7.2. It occurs in the clause-initial position and is followed by adverbs and
arguments. It seems plausible to argue that in contexts as (195) the adverbial predicate
ding kang has been lexicalized to an adverb with meaning ‘probably’:

akun ‘be dark’
The completive verb akun ‘be dark’ indicates the location of an event after some period
of darkness. In (196), an adverbial phrase containing akun ‘be dark’ occurs between the
A argument of the clause and the VP we ‘leave’. The phrase consists of the verb mi ‘be
in’ that refers to a location the darkness, and serves as a complement clause of the
generic verb ng ‘see’. The generic verb ng ‘see’ combines with the completive stem
akun ‘be dark’ in allative serial verb construction (see 8.4.2.1). The adverbial phrase
mi=ng akun could be literally translated as ‘darkened into (it)’.

"6 Verb Phrase and Clause
This first part of this chapter deals with the syntactic units headed by verbs: verb
phrases (VP). In a VP, Abui verb may either occur bare or associated with additional
morphology displaying person and aspect inflection of the head verb, as discussed in
6.1. In aspectual inflection, aspectual suffixes and/or clitics are attached to the verb to
indicate the aspectual properties of the referred event. I describe aspectual inflection in
6.1.1. In person inflection, pronominal prefixes indicate the number and type of the U
argument(s) of a verb. Person inflection is described in section 6.1.2
Section 6.2 deals with clauses. In a clause, a VP may combine with arguments
realized with free pronouns and NPs. In section 6.2.1, I identify the basic constructions
in which a VP combines with its argument(s). Section 6.3 gives an overview of
adverbial modifiers found in the left edge. Negation, predicate markers, anaphoric
demonstratives and illocutionary force particles are found on the right edge or right
periphery. I discuss negation in section 6.4.1. Predicate markers are described in section
6.4.2. In 6.4.3, I deal with anaphoric demonstratives that follow a predicate.","[231, 232]"

Phasal aspect markers si (PHSL.I) and ti (PHSL.C)
The phasal aspect marker si (PHSL.I) refers to the point just after the start of an event.
The marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates the point right after an event has finished. Both
markers are formally related to the inceptive markers. In fact, the inceptive and phasal224CHAPTER VImarkers have reversed functions: inceptive markers refer to the point just before, while
phasal markers refer to the point just after. In (46), both phasal markers are contrasted.

‘he just went’ [B02.086.07:47]The phasal inceptive marker si (PHSL.I) in (46) indicates that the event of ‘coming down’
has just started. The phasal completive marker ti (PHSL.C) indicates that the event of
‘going’ just finished. Note that the marker ti (PHSL.C) does not require the completive
stem of ‘go’ yaar. Another contrastive pair of examples is given in (47).

‘Arjun has just finished looking (how) Maifan is leaving’[B06.008.01]The phasal markers are often used with complement clauses that follow the verb. An
example is given in (48), where the verb piei-l-a ‘dream’ combines with the phasal
marker ti (PHSL.C) and is followed by a complement clause that expresses the content of
the dream. The complement clause contains the affirmative marker ba that indicates
that the reported event really happened (see also 6.4.2.1).

[B07.010.02]Another use of phasal marker is to introduce a conditional clause in (50)-(51). In (50),
the clause do-mon=ti ‘he died’ introduces a hypothetical condition for the statement
expressed in the clause kang ‘it would be good’.

[B07.079.01]Deictic demonstrativesAs adverbial modifiers, deictic demonstratives indicate the location of an event in
space. As discussed in 3.5.2, demonstratives may occur in both the nominal domain and
the verbal domain. In both domains, demonstratives may occur in two syntactic
positions. They either precede or follow the head. In a clause, deictic demonstratives
precede the VP, the anaphoric demonstratives follow it. When the demonstrative
precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to the location of the event. When it follows
the head verb, it locates the event expressed by the VP in discourse (see also 4.4.3).
In the following examples, I illustrate the use of the deictic demonstratives as adverbial
modifiers. In (180), the deictic demonstrative do (PRX) locates the event ‘here’ by the
speaker.

[B07.039.05]The use of the deictic demonstrative to (PRX.AD) is illustrated in (181). It indicates a
proximate location with respect to the addressee. The verb ba ‘say’ is grammaticalized
as an affirmative marker (see 6.4.2).

demonstrative to (PRX.AD) that indicates the ‘temporal’ location of the event (see 6.4.3).

playing with a cat as ‘over there’. It occurs between the NPs expressing the arguments.

[B02.033.08:28]6.3.3Predicates functioning as adverbial modifiersThere are a number of predicates (both nominal and verbal) that are used as adverbial
modifiers. These modifiers normally precede the arguments and can be treated as
independent predicates.13 In some cases, they are preceded by one of the arguments.
This is illustrated in (185). The adverbial modifier akun ‘be dark’ is found between the
VP làk ‘leave for’ and its argument ama nu ‘somebody’ in (a). In (b), the verb akun ‘be
dark’ precedes. In that case it is ambiguous and can be treated as a separate clause.

"2SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS349verbs. This property is illustrated in (4) with the verbs me ‘come’ and yai paneng ‘sing’,
these verbs combine to form a single clause:3
(4)moku meyaipanengkid
come

‘the child came to sing’[B07.015.01]In (3), serial verb constructions are cross-linguistically characterized as monoclausal
units without conjunction markers (i). Abui verb clusters have the same property, as
illustrated in (4).
CONTIGUOUS CONSTRUCTION. The verb clusters such as in (4) are contiguous; no
constituents except the arguments may intervene between the verbs. This is further
illustrated in (5) where the form afeida ‘yesterday’ expressing the time of the event must
precede the verbs tilei ‘hang (out)’ and lol ‘walk’, see (a). It is ungrammatical to place a
non-argument constituent such as afeida ‘yesterday’ between the verbs of the verb
cluster, see (b):

constructions that allow only arguments to intervene between the verbs, see (ii). Other
constituents are not allowed to intervene between the verbs.
SHARED INTONATION CONTOUR. Verb clusters such as in (4) and (5) share a
single intonation contour similar to that of a monoverbal clause and not to that of a
sequence of clauses. There is no intonation break (typically indicating a clause
boundary) between the verbs. As listed in (3), serial verb constructions are crosslinguistically characterized by intonational properties of a monoverbal clause.
SHARED ASPECTUAL INFLECTION. The verbs in verb clusters such as illustrated in
(4) and (5) share the aspectual inflection in most cases. This is illustrated in (6) where
the verbs wai ‘turn back’ and kok ‘prod’ in (a) share the aspectual markers -u (PRF) and
te (INCP.I). The verbs yaa ‘go’ and sik ‘sever’ in (b) share the imperfective aspectual
suffix -e (IPFV):The verbs that are serialized in (4) may be combined using a conjunction marker. In the following example,
the verbs me ‘come’ and yai paneng ‘sing’ combine in a complex sentence. The sentence consists of two
clauses linked with the sequential linker ya (SEQ). Constructions like this one will not be considered SVCs.

‘I am going to harvest rice’In the literature about Papuan languages, a distinction is made between FINAL
and MEDIAL verbs (cf. Foley, 1986:176). Final verbs, as their name suggests, are those
verbs that appear in the final position of a verb cluster or verb chain and carry the
verbal inflections. Medial verbs, as their name suggests, are those verbs that appear in
non-final positions and do not carry the same verbal inflections. The verbal inflections
mentioned by Foley (1986:176) include inflections for person and tense.
In Abui, the only inflections that appear following the verb stem are aspectual
markers. However, a similar distinction can be made between the verbs in a verb
cluster. Only the final verb of a verb cluster appears to carry the aspectual inflections.
The ‘medial verb(s)’ in a verb cluster appear bare, without aspectual inflections. In
Abui, a large set of verbs alternate their stems depending on the aspectual inflection
that follows, cf. 3.4.2.3. Some of these stems are bound forms that cannot function as
predicates in monoverbal clauses. They always require the aspectual inflection.
However, these bound stems may appear as ‘middle verbs’ within a verb cluster, as
illustrated in (7). In (a), the stem yaar ‘go’ is used as medial verb of a verb cluster. In
(b), the verb stem yaar ‘go’ is used as predicate in monoverbal clause, but such use is
ungrammatical as the stem yaar ‘go’ is a bound verb stem; it would require a perfective
suffix -i (PFV).
(7)a. riyaarkan-r-ib. *ri yaar2PL go.CPL good.CPL-reach-PFV
‘you go completely, lit.: you go finish’ [B02.040.12:44]2PL go.CPLIn (3), serial verb constructions are cross-linguistically characterized by shared verbal
inflections (iv). In Abui, verb clusters such as (7) share aspectual inflection. They
display the same characteristic as what was defined as serial verb constructions (see also
8.1.2).
SHARED NEGATION. In Abui, verbs clusters share negation expressed with the
negator naha (NEG). In a monoverbal clause, the negator follows the verb. In verb
clusters the negator follows the final verb of the cluster negating both verbs. This is
illustrated in (8) where in (a) the negator naha (NEG) appears following the final verb
and both verbs are negated. The negator may not intervene between the two verbs (b):

listed in (3). As illustrated in (8), Abui verb clusters display the same property.","[371, 372, 373]"
"3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and wordexternal (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to timestable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[89, 90]"

to the kind of the referent. The indexed events and referents are located on the familiar
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL axis. This axis is found also in Abui demonstratives and
deictic verbs. Note that the perfect stems nu and hu have been grammaticalized as
anaphoric demonstratives indicating ‘specificity’. For more details, see section 3.5.2.2.
Abui index verbs are used in questions and in constructions that express the
kind of the referent. The kind of a referent and the manner of an event is described in a
complement clause that serves as an argument of the index verb.11 The proximal index
verbs na/ni/n-u ‘be like.PRX’ are used to refer to the manner and kind obvious and
familiar to both speech participants. The medial index verbs wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ are
frequently used in questions. The speaker presents the questioned manner or kind as
medial. The distal index verbs ha/hi/h-u ‘be like.DST’ are used to refer to manner or
kind that is not familiar to the speaker. The verb ha ‘be like.DST’ may be used to refer
to the manner in which the addressee intends to perform an event, from which the
speaker wants to dissociate himself.
An example of the manner anaphoric use is given in (112). The verb stem wa
‘be like.MD’ combines with the argument, expressed with the pronominal prefix do(3I.REC). It refers to the rain that prevented the participant from going to the market.

[B07.079.01]An example of the use referring to the kind of referent is given in (113). The index verb
ha ‘be like.DST’ occurs as a single predicate in a question. This question is used in
situation when the Abui equivalent of the Malay word anjing ‘dog’ is asked:
(113) ‘anjing’ nu
nala ha?

SPC.AD what be.like.DST.CNT
‘what is the word ‘anjing’ (in Abui)?’[Note.009.07]In (114), the perfect stem n-u ‘be like.PRX’ combines with pronominal prefix he(3II.LOC). It marks the first clause as a manner in which the event described in the
11 Index verbs semantically group the manner of event (in fact kind of event) and the kind of referent in
adnominal and question uses. In the literature similar predicates were referred to as kind-anaphoric predicates
(cf. Landman and Morzycki, 2003:11).","[129, 130]"
"6.3Adverbial modifiersAdverbial modifiers specify the temporal and spatial settings of an event. Adverbial
modifiers may be adverbs (see 6.3.1), deictic demonstratives (see 6.3.2), or independent
nominal or verbal predicates (see 6.3.3). Adverbial modifiers are considered
independent predicates when they combine with anaphoric demonstratives. In a clause,
usually not more than two adverbials occur at the same time.
Adverbial modifiers are found in the left edge of a clause as illustrated in (161).
Adverbials modifiers usually follow the fronted A argument. Optionally, adverbials are
extracted to the focus position in the far left of a clause or form a separate adverbial
phrase. The deictic demonstratives (DEICT.DEM) are located the closest to the VP,
adverbs (ADV) are more to the left, and the independent predicates (ADVERBIALS) often
constitute a separate phrase that precedes the clause.

as yal ‘now’, el ‘before’, ko ‘soon’, wan ‘already’ (see also 3.5.5). Their function as
adverbial modifiers is illustrated below.
6.3.1.1
yal ‘now’
The adverb yal ‘now’ locates an event in present time (temporal location overlapping
with the time of speech). In (162), the adverb yal ‘now’ occurs in left edge position in
(a), and is extracted to the focus position in (b), where it combines with the anaphoric
demonstrative do (PRX).

with the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX), which I analyze as forming a separate
adverbial phrase, located in the periphery, in fact, outside the clause.
6.3.1.2
el ‘before’
The adverb el ‘before, earlier on’ indicates that the event is antecedent to the time of
speech. As illustrated in (163), el ‘before’ occurs either between the A and U argument
(a) or may be extracted to the focus position (b).

[B01.032.08]As illustrated in (a), the adverb el ‘before’ tends to co-occur with perfective aspect
marker.
6.3.1.3
wan ‘already’
The adverb wan ‘already’ indicates that an event occurred in time preceding the time of
speech. The adverb wan ‘already’ occurs typically between the A and U argument. This
is illustrated in (164). In (b), it is found preceding the VP and following the clause anui
sei ‘it rains’, which expresses the single argument of the verb kan-d- ‘get finished’.

the A argument.

The adverb dara ‘still’ originates in the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ (see 8.4.7.3). It
indicates that an event is performed in a persistent way. The adverb dara ‘still’ may be
combined with negation to refer to events that have not occurred yet. In (167), the
adverb dara ‘still’ combines with the verb afei-d-a ‘be yesterday, lit.: become passed’
(see also 6.3.3.7).

‘it was still yesterday when the glass was put on the table’[B09.075.01]In (168), the adverb dara ‘still’ occurs in a negated clause marking that the speaker has
not visited the village named Ruilak yet.

wala ‘so’
The adverb wala ‘so, only’ indicates a manner in which the event is performed, typically
it indicates the extension of an event or the quantity of participants. In (169), the
adverb wala ‘so’ indicates how many items were taken.

[B07.047.04]VERB PHRASE AND CLAUSE267In (170), a fragment of a bride price negotiation is given. As the good custom requires,
a lot of betel nut has to be consumed during such an event. A number of old men
discuss whether they have some betel nut or proceed negotiating. One of the men
brings betel nut and betel vine and utters the following construction. The adverb wala
‘so’ indicates that the other men may take betel vine if they wish ‘so’.

‘the betel vine (that you just talked about), you just take behind…’[B13.013.38:44]The adverbial wala ‘so’ seems to refer to a kind in some cases. In (171), the adverbial
wala ‘so’ indicates that there is no such a person that witnessed the speaker coming
back.

yang ‘perhaps’
The adverb yang ‘perhaps’ indicates epistemic modality and is used to express speaker’s
doubts about the reality of the reported event. Neutrally, yang occurs between the
arguments as illustrated in (172).
(172) kaai

by the adverb ko ‘soon’ and wan ‘already’.

‘perhaps his knife will already soon get lost’[B07.022.05]6.3.1.9
sawai ‘in vain’
The adverb sawai ‘be in vain’ encodes that the effort of the participant is fruitless. The
adverb sawai is related to the verb sai ‘put along’ and also to the form sai-sai ‘in vain,
vainly’ (see 8.4.6.4). An example of such construction is given in (174) where sawai ‘be
in vain’ combines with the verb tahai ‘search’.","[287, 288, 289, 290]"

This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

referent. An example is given in (190), where the number of pigs is questioned. The
question word yeng ‘how much’ occurs in the final position of the NP. This is the
position of the quantifier within an NP, as illustrated by the second clause, where the
quantifier buti ‘four’ follows the head noun.

In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[153, 154, 155, 156]"

‘I cannot do anything, I am stuck’, lit.: ‘I cannot detach myself and turn’[B05.072.01]In some cases beka ‘be bad’ may be used to express epistemic modality; it indicates that
the expressed event is according to the speaker ‘unlikely’ to happen. Consider now the
use of beka ‘be bad’ in (67), where the verbs -liel ‘lift’ and beka ‘be bad’ share a single
argument expressed with the free pronoun di (3A).
(67)dina-lielbeka3A
1SG.PAT-lift be.bad
‘he could not lift me up’[B06.017.07]8.3.4.3
SVC with kaleng ‘avoid’
The minor verb kaleng ‘avoid’ is used in modal SVCs to express the negative intention
or attitude of speaker. In (68), the minor verb kaleng ‘avoid’ is serialized with the major
verb me ‘come’. Both verbs share a single argument realized as the NP tuong ‘chief’
and indexed with the REC prefix on kaleng ‘avoid’:
(68)tuong medo-kalengchief
come
3I.REC-avoid
‘the chief does not want to come’[B07.011.06]Another example is given in (69) where the minor verb kaleng ‘avoid’ combines with
wel ‘pour’. Both verbs share a single argument expressed by pronominal prefix on each
verb. In the second clause, the minor verb kul ‘must’ combines with the major verb wel
‘pour’ (more details about this type of modal SVC can be found in 8.4.7.1).

‘he does not want to wash himself, but he will have to’[B07.072.02]In (70), the verb -lak-d-a ‘read’ and kalen-r-i ‘avoid’ are serialized. The first part of the
serial verb construction serves as a complement of the verb kalen-r-i ‘be fed up with’
and is co-indexed with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC).

SVC with ién ‘see’
The minor verb ién ‘see’ indicates potential modality but also strongly interacts with
aspect. It expresses that the referred event is in its initial stage: either it has started
already or it is about to start. Note that ién ‘see’ is the completive stem of the verb -ién
‘see’. In (71) -ién ‘see’ combines with the verb kariang ‘work’ indicating that Nani
might ‘work’. The verbs kariang ‘work’ and ién ‘see’ share a single argument expressed
with the NP Nani. The first part of the serial verb construction serves as a complement
of the verb -ién ‘see’ and is co-indexed with the PAT prefix h- (3II.PAT).
(71)Nani ba-i, [yal dohe-nkariang]complement h-ién-iname say-PFV now PRX 3II.LOC-see.CPL work
‘Nani also might work now’3II.PAT-see.CPL-PFV
[Mail2006.03.15]The verb ién ‘see’ often occurs in SVCs together with the minor verb ra ‘reach’ (see
8.4.7.3) indicating together that the participant is going to ‘try, attempt’ to perform an
event as in (72). In (a), the verbs mara ‘go up’, wahai ‘look’ and -ién ‘see’ share a single
A argument realized with the free pronoun na (1SG). The first part of the SVC serves as
a complement of the verb -ién ‘see’. In (b), the verb yaar ‘go’ is serialized with -ién
‘see’. Both verbs share the A argument expressed with the free pronoun na (1SG). The
verb yaar ‘go’ combines in allative serial construction with the verb ng ‘see’ (8.4.2.1).
Note that the part of the construction which is marked by the brackets serves as a
complement of the verb -ién ‘see’ and is co-indexed with the prefix h- (3II.PAT).

[B05.045.02]SVCs with index verbsIndex verbs used as minor verbs have a kind-anaphoric function as they refer to the
manner in which an event was performed.12 The manner itself is usually expressed in a
preceding complement constituent. The complement is either part of the same serial
verb constructions, such as in as in (73), or it an independent clause as in (74). Index
verbs are a closed verb class containing five verbs (for more details, see 3.4.5.6). This
section is organized as follows: the SVCs with the index verb na/ni ‘be like.PRX’ are
discussed in 8.3.5.1, followed by wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ in 8.3.5.2, and finally by ha ‘be
like.DST’ in 8.3.5.3.
Abui index verbs have also adnominal and wh- construction uses. The index verbs are best analyzed as an
overt kind-anaphora that semantically groups the manner of event (in fact kind of event) and the kind of
referent (in adnominal and wh- uses), (cf. Landman and Morzycki 2003).","[392, 393, 394]"

‘and went to assist the (other) woman to give birth’[B02.027.04:24]The presented examples (242)-(244) show two instances of tail-head linkage, which is
used frequently in Abui narratives (see texts in Appendix for more examples). Tail-head
linkage is a typical feature of many Papuan languages (cf. De Vries, 2005).
6.4.3.2
Anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD)
The anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) used as final constituent of a sentence
indicates the proximate temporal location of the referred event with respect to the
addressee. This means that the speaker presents new information to the addressee as if
he already knows about it. An example is given in (245). This is a fragment from the
narrative moku ayoku which is a story of two orphans. A part of the story was given in
(242)-(244). Here a blind woman is cheated by another woman. Her baby is stolen and
she is presented a banana blossom and blamed as a witch that cannot bear proper
human beings. When the husband returns home and asks about the baby that was born
while he was away, the blind woman gives him the following answer:

PRX.AD
[B02.029.05:30]VERB PHRASE AND CLAUSE287In the previous example, the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) referred to an event
that occurred in the past. In (246), the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) refers to an
event that is about to occur. The completive stem of the verb aisa/aisi ‘urinate’ does
not indicate the past but expresses the event of ‘peeing’ is viewed as having a final
point.

‘ah, I am just going to pee’[B06.082.04:02]In (247), the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) occurs in sentence-medial position. It
indicates the location of ‘telling a story’ as proximate to ‘laughing’. This construction is
uttered as an instruction how to tell a story that is going to be recorded. The speaker
chooses the perspective of the addressee, as he is not participating in the event.

[B06.039.07:03]The addressee oriented anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) expresses speaker’s
empathy with the addressee. This is again illustrated in (248), where the anaphoric
demonstrative to (PRX.AD) combines with the particle doma ‘no’ to negate the request
presented in the first line.

[B09.004.04:19]6.4.3.3
Anaphoric demonstrative o (MD)
The anaphoric demonstrative o (MD) indicates a medial (less proximate) temporal
location of an event. It is usually used to refer to events that occurred some time ago, as
illustrated in (249).
(249) Fani, sameng ba, Pak Kas di mi ba
Takpala

‘Fani, the cement, Mr. Karsten brought it up to Takpala’maran-iocome.up.CPL-PFV MD
[Sms.01.03]288CHAPTER VIIn (250), the anaphoric demonstrative o (MD) is used in sentence-medial positions. It
indicates that the reported event preceded the event reported by the second phrase or
clause. The complement clause in (a) is embedded because the A argument of the verb
ién ‘see’ in the matrix clause is fronted to the focus position. The clause neng di do-làk
‘the man returned’ expresses a complement of the verb ién ‘see’ which is co-indexed
with the pronominal prefix h- (3II.PAT). Note that the A argument of the verb làk ‘leave
for’ cannot be cross-referenced as the A argument of the verb ién ‘see’ in the matrix
clause. This example provides the evidence of the lack of pivots for cross-clausal
coreference in Abui. The complement clause in (a) can be also analyzed as an internal
relative clause. In (b), the same event is expressed. This is an instance of a paratactic
complement clause (cf. Noonan, To appear: 14-6). The complement clause is not
embedded. In (c), a similar meaning is expressed in a construction with again a different
structure containing a relative clause. Note that the anaphoric demonstrative o (MD)
occurs as the final constituent in the relative clause do-làk o.

Anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD)
The anaphoric demonstrative yo (MD.AD) indicates the medial (less proximate) temporal
location of the referred event from addressee’s perspective. It is usually used to draw
addressee’s attention to a new piece of information. In (251), a piece of a dialogue is
given. The grandfather is about to teach his grandson how to shoot with a long bow.
The grandmother asks about what they will be shooting at. The anaphoric
demonstrative yo (MD.AD) refers to the temporal location of shooting in future.

argument slots that may be filled with pronominal prefixes expressing the U argumentsINTRODUCTION17(the A argument is not expressed inside the VP). The template contains three slots for
aspect.
(13)VP TEMPLATE: PRO.2-PRO.1-VERB.STEM-ASPECT.1-ASPECT.2=ASPECT.3Many Abui verbs occur with one or two arguments. There are no ditransitive verbs.
However, it often proves difficult to identify the valence of a verbal stem. With respect
to the dichotomy of transitivizing and detransitivizing languages (cf. Nichols et al.,
2004), Abui can be characterized as ‘neutral’. Therefore, verbs are described as
occurring in a number of constructions listed in (14). There are four major
constructions: A-U transitive, U-U transitive, intransitive and experiencer
constructions. Below, the subtypes of each construction are listed. Each construction is
described in terms of its typical argument constellation and the type of event that it may
express.

CLAUSE. In (15), Abui clause structure is given. In the core, the VP combines withoptional NPs or free pronouns that express the A and U arguments. Adverbial
modifiers precede the arguments or intervene between them. The left-most position is
pragmatically marked for focus. The VP is followed by negator, ‘affirmative’ marker, or
anaphoric demonstratives, which are the final constituents.

denote substances rather than well-defined objects. These nouns typically combine with
modifier nouns that specify their shape and size. In enumeration, the modifier noun
typically co-occurs with the quantifier because the head noun is not sufficiently
individuated to be quantified (see also 4.4.4.1). This is illustrated in (72), where the head
noun seng ‘money’ combines with two modifier nouns that specify the shape of the
‘money’ substance. The banknotes are referred to as watala ‘leaves’, while for coins the
modifier noun tipai ‘iron’ is used to indicate the material from which this type of
money is made. Note that both NPs refer to a type of money and not to a type of
leaves or iron, which would be the case if these structures were compounds.

(cf. Payne 1997:63). As illustrated in (75), stative verbs and adjectives follow the head
noun. In (a), the adjective kul ‘white’ follows the head noun kaai ‘dog’, as well as the
stative verbs kiding ‘small’, foka ‘big’ and fila ‘young’ in (b-d):
(75)a. kaai kulb. faladog white
‘white dog’c. bataakidinghouse small
‘small house’fokad. mokuwood
be.big
‘big tree’filakid
be.young
‘little child’As discussed in section 3.5.1, adjectives are syntactically differentiated from stative
verbs. Both grammatical categories may serve as modifiers in an NP, but stative verbs
may also serve as a head of a VP and combine with a single argument. In Abui,
arguments always precede the verb, which means that a structure consisting of a noun
followed by a stative verb is ambiguous and may be interpreted either as an NP or as a
VP. On the other hand, the adjectives cannot be used as predicates, heading a VP.
These properties are summarized in Table 18:
Table 18: Distributional properties of adjectives and stative verbs
GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY NP DOMAIN VP DOMAIN
ADJECTIVE
STATIVE VERBModifier
Modifier*
PredicateThe functional asymmetry between adjectives and stative verbs has a consequence, that
only the structures consisting of a noun followed by an adjective are unambiguous NPs.
This restricted functional property of a noun phrase with an adjectival modifier is
further exemplified in (76). In (a, d, g) the adjective modifier of the noun phrase has an
attributive function, but as illustrated in (b, e, h) it does not have a predicative function.
Instead a complex verb must be used that incorporates the adjectival element:160(76)CHAPTER IVa. kaai kulb. kaai kuldog white

‘the banana is ripe’As discussed in section 3.5.1, the grammatical category of adjectives is closed; it
contains only six items. The set of stative verbs is much larger, as shown in section
3.4.4.8. Therefore most NPs that contain an attributive modifier are ambiguous.
Structures that consist of a single noun and a stative verb may be interpreted nonpredicatively as an NP or predicatively consisting of a stative verb combined with a
single argument realized as a bare NP. This ambiguity is illustrated in (77). The
structure consisting of the noun ama ‘person’ and the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ is
ambiguous and can be interpreted either as an NP (a) or as N + VP (b).
(77)a. amatukoiperson be.strong
‘strong person’b. amatukoiperson be.strong
‘the person is strong’Structures similar to those in (77) are disambiguated when another NP-domain
constituent is present. This is illustrated in (78), where the numeral nuku ‘one’ follows
the stative verb bui ‘be short’. In Abui, numerals may not modify verbs and therefore
the structure in (b) is identified as an NP. Another constituent that occurs exclusively in
NP domain is the plural quantifier loku (PL). In (d), its presence identifies the given
structure as an NP.
(78)a. luibuiknife

‘one short knife’d. mayol finglokuwoman be.eldest PL
‘the first wives’As illustrated in (78), the quantifiers nuku ‘one’ and loku (PL) follow the stative verb.
More details about the NP syntax dealing with more than one modifier can be found in
section 4.4.5.
There are cases, where an NP containing a stative verb seems lexicalized. In
(79), the head noun ama ‘person’ combines with a stative verb. The noun ama ‘person’NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES161may occur independently referring to an unspecified human being. The noun ama
‘person’ combines with the stative verb kang ‘be good’ to refer neutrally to a human
being, as also illustrated in (80). The stative verb kang ‘be good’ can be alternated with
the stative verb beka ‘be bad’, but in that case, the NP has a negative connotation of a
‘bad guy’.
(79)amakangamaperson
be.good
‘person, guy’bekaperson be.bad
‘bad guy, villain’The NP ama kang ‘person, guy’ seems lexicalized. It is typically used to refer to
inhabitants of a village or area. Note that area is referred to as a possessor of the noun
ama ‘person’ with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL).

3II.AL-person be.good
‘guy from Takalelang, Takalelang person’Pido he-amakangplace 3II.AL-person be.good
‘guy from Pido, Pido person’Another example of a lexicalized NP is given in (81), where the modifier kira
‘be hard’ combines with the head noun pikai ‘head’. The NP refers metaphorically to a
stubborn person rather than to a hard head.
(81)pikaikirahead
be.hard
‘stubborn person, pig-headed person’Other instances of lexicalized NPs that refer to a characteristic property of a human
referent are given in (82). The property is assigned to a body part and the human
referent is expressed in some cases by an obligatory possessor marking.

discourse. The two functions of Abui demonstratives are distinguished syntactically.
This is illustrated in (83). In (a), the demonstrative do (PRX) refers to a proximate spatial162CHAPTER IVlocation of the referent fala ‘house’. In (b), the same form refers to the proximate
discourse location of the same referent fala ‘house’.
(83)a. dofalab. falaPRX
house
‘this house (located by me)’dohouse PRX
‘this house (I talk about)’This shows that those demonstratives that precede the head noun indicate its spatial
location; they are deictic demonstratives (DEICT). The demonstratives that follow the
head noun indicate its discourse location; they are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM).
Both functions are further discussed below. In Abui, both deictic demonstratives as
well as anaphoric demonstratives provide anchoring along a number of axes: SPEAKERADDRESSEE, PROXIMAL-DISTAL, and HIGH-LOW (see also section 3.5.2.1). Two of these axes
apply to anaphoric demonstratives (SPEAKER-ADDRESSEE, PROXIMAL-DISTAL), and all three
of them apply to deictic demonstratives. In the remainder of this section, I deal with
both types of demonstratives. In section 4.4.3.1, I give an overview of the axis that
constitute Abui deictic system and exemplify the use of deictic demonstratives within
an NP. In 4.4.3.2, I discuss anaphoric demonstratives.
4.4.3.1
Deictic demonstratives
Deictic demonstratives combine with nouns to indicate distance or orientation of the
referent with respect to speech participants (cf. Payne 1997:103). An overview of Abui
deictic demonstratives is given in Table 19.

4.4.3.2
Anaphoric demonstratives
Demonstratives following the head noun identify the referent in discourse. They
indicate the referential properties of the nouns such as [±specific] and [±definite]. The
proximal and medial anaphoric demonstratives have a relative frame of reference; they
alternate the viewpoint (V) over speaker or addressee. Definiteness is generally defined
as the identifiability of the referent for both the speaker and the addressee. Considering
this, only the proximal and medial anaphoric demonstratives indicate a [+definite]
referent. An overview of the anaphoric demonstratives is given in Table 20:NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES163Table 20: Abui anaphoric demonstratives

"8 Serial Verb Constructions
In general, Abui speakers use more verbs to refer to simple events than English
speakers. In (1) the expressed events of ‘taking back’ and ‘bringing back’ are spelled out
in serial verb constructions that describe the event components in step by step fashion.1
(1)a. ha-waimi-a!b. na mi3II.PAT-turn take-DUR
‘take it back!’ha-waimiei1SG take 3II.PAT-turn
‘I brought it back’come.CPLSerial verb constructions (SVCs) are often thought of as verb clusters without any over
marker of coordination or subordination. Foley and Olson (1985) argue that the verbs
in SVCs behave as a single predicate in a simple clause with respect to grammatical
operators such as negation or aspectual inflection. As illustrated in (1), Abui SVCs
consist minimally of two verbs (a), but often more verbs are serialized (b). In a SVC,
different meaning components of the verbs may be activated (cf. Crowley, 2002:22-3).
This is illustrated (2). The verb me ‘come’ encodes direction in (a), while in (b) it
encodes manner and perhaps some aspect (gradual change).
(2)a. di tur-iyamime3A scoop.CPL-PFV SEQ take come
‘she scooped up and brought it (towards DC)b. di meha-rik-i3A come 3II.PAT-hurt-PFV
‘he got gradually ill’In view of this Abui SVCs should not be dealt with as a single construction, but rather
as a collection of constructions sharing the same set of conceptual, grammatical,
morpho-syntactic and semantic properties (cf. Crowley 2002:1-23).
In section 8.1, I give grammatical, compositional and semantic characteristics of
Abui SVCs. Compositional characteristics of SVCs are taken as the main criterion in
describing Abui SVCs (8.1.2). They are described as symmetrical or asymmetrical,
following the dichotomy established by Aikhenvald (2006). In section 8.2, I describe
symmetrical SVCs in which the verbs have ‘equal’ grammatical status. The verbs in
symmetrical SVCs encode the reported event in a step by step fashion by listing the
verbs.
The asymmetrical SVCs consist of a two verbs of ‘unequal’ grammatical status.
The ‘minor verb’ has a grammatical function as the verb me ‘come’ in (2). The ‘major
verb’ is the semantic head of the SVC. I distinguish two types of asymmetrical SVCs
taking the syntactic position of the ‘minor’ verb as the formal criterion. In section 8.3, I
describe asymmetrical SVCs in which the minor verb follows the major verb. The
minor verb expresses aspect, direction, manner and mood.","[368, 369, 370]"

‘grandfather, your second grandson will actually sit a bit’[B02.043.14:32]As illustrated in (109), the linker ba (LNK) may link bare NPs with a single modifier,
usually a stative verb in (a, b). The structures in (a, b) have a restrictive reading.
Consider also the distinction between (b) and (c). While (b) refers to a person that is
bad because of his deeds, (c) has an open reading and refers to a ‘bad guy’, i.e. a person
who does not necessarily do anything bad, but has a potential to do so.

ba (LNK) is obligatory when the following verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’ is to be
interpreted as a modifier (a). The intersective linker ba (LNK) follows the modifier
palata ‘be cold’ and introduces a relative clause. In (b) and (c), the intersective linker ba
(LNK) is not present; consequently, both constructions have a different reading. In (c),
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) follows the verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’. The
demonstrative is not interpreted as an adnominal modifier because the verb dakun-i
‘become dirty’ is not embedded but predicates over the NP ya palata ‘cold water’. For
the clause level functions of anaphoric demonstratives see section 6.4.3.

meting ‘betel nut and betel vine’ is logically the U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ but in

[B01.079.02:01]In (112) a complex structure serves as the U argument of the verb tahai ‘search’. In this
structure, the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the bare NP kafiei ‘goat’ with the relative
clause nai-d-i nu ‘became lost (some time ago)’. Note that the head noun kafiei ‘goat’ is
the single argument of the verb nai-d- ‘get lost’.

[B07.013.01]In (113), the bare NP fe ‘pig’ combines with a relative clause. Observe that the head
noun fe ‘pig’ is co-indexed as the possessor of the noun toku ‘leg’ in the relative clause.
The noun toku ‘leg’ serves as the U argument of the verb kor ‘bind’. The A argument
of the verb kor ‘bind’ is not expressed. Note that the relativized NP fe ‘pig’ is coindexed with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL) and PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) inside the

headed by fala ‘house’ contains a possessor e-maama mantan kades ‘your father,
former village head’. This NP is linked with a large relative clause given between curly172CHAPTER IVbrackets. The example comes from a conversation concerning the place name Fota
Ailol. The name refers to a place with a large wide stone that used to be a resting place
in the old days. The speaker described the stone as being located with respect to the
house of the addressee’s uncle. He refers to the house as standing below a big and wide
stone like this.

[B02.127.01:35]From the previous examples, we can conclude that the linker ba (LNK) links an NP and
a modifier in a structure that functions as single NP. In fact, this definition can be
expanded also to the clause level, as the linker ba (LNK) serves to link verbs in a single
clause (see also section 3.5.6). The linked ba (LNK) has an intersective function; it links
two constituents to a single unit on the level of one of them.
In the complex NPs given so far, the NP precedes the linker ba (LNK) linking it
with a modifier constituent (adnominal modifier or a clause). The modified NP may be
considered as the head of the construction. However, in some cases, the modifying
constituent precedes the noun or the noun may be omitted. The modifier constituent
has either deictic or possessive function and its location corresponds to the location of
deictics and possessors within the NP. In (116), the relative clause nopa mia ‘be
touching on me’ precedes the NP bataa do ‘the wood’. The linker ba (LNK) follows the
clause. In (b), the expected constituent order is given which is also attested.

modifiers precede the head noun in the NP.

the quantifier loku (PL). The complex NP serves as argument for the index verb n-u ‘be

[B06.038.05:20]In (119), a complex construction is given where an NP headed by the noun he-kalieta
‘old person’ combines with the noun Kafola that expresses the possessor of the noun
kalieta ‘old person’ referring to the area where the old person comes from. It precedes
the NP and is linked with ba (LNK). The NP contains an embedded relative clause
marked with curly brackets. The evidence that this relative clause is embedded comes
from the position of the numeral nuku ‘one’, which follows the relative clause but
quantifies the noun kalieta ‘old person’. The relative clause he-tafaa do ayoku fala mi-a
‘his two drums are in the house’ is not linked to the head kalieta ‘old person’ with the
linker ba (LNK) as expected. One possibility is that it is omitted in the fast speech (this is
a fragment of a conversation); another possibility is that the possessive prefix he(3II.AL) that links the noun tafaa ‘drum’ to the possessor kalieta ‘old person’ is
sufficient.

‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’[B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).

there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example ofNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES175nominal predication is given in (123). In (a), the bare NP kalieta ‘old person’ serves as
nominal predicate. In (b), the NP moku fila ‘small child’ predicates over Fan Malei.

This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal
predicate with the NP Simon ayoku ‘two Simons’. The construction is contrasted with
nominal predicative construction in (b).

index verb wi-d- ‘be like.MD’ usually follows both NPs. This is illustrated in (128),176CHAPTER IVwhere the NPs Jakarta do ‘Jakarta’ and Takalelang fila ‘small Takalelang’ precede the
verb wi-d- ‘become like that’.

Typically it is followed by an intonational pause, marked here with a comma.

‘as for the cement, Mr. Karsten brought it up to Takpala (some time ago)’ [Sms.01.03]The form ba is glossed as ‘say’; it occurs in the verbal domain as affirmative marker (see
6.4.2.1) and may introduce conditional clauses. In (131), two constructions are given
that refer to kind. The NPs neng loku ‘men’ and mayol loku ‘women’ are the
arguments of the verb ba ‘say’. The verb ba ‘say’ marks the NPs as the topic for the
index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ which is co-indexed with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC). The

In this chapter, I discuss Abui argument realization. Event participants are realized as
different arguments of a verb with NPs and/or pronouns. The choice of the
appropriate realization is determined by the semantic properties of the participant. This
is discussed in section 5.1. The controlling and volitional participants are identified for
the actor (A) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or free pronouns. The affected
participants are identified for the undergoer (U) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or
bound pronouns. The listed criteria apply to arguments in both transitive and
intransitive constructions.
The choice between a pronoun and an NP is determined by the referential
properties of the participant. In section 5.2, I show that arguments with a specific
reference are expressed with pronouns and optional NPs; arguments with a nonspecific reference are expressed with NPs. In section 5.3, I discuss the A arguments
that are expressed with free pronouns. In section 5.4, the U arguments expressed with
bound pronouns are described. There are three distinct sets of bound pronouns that
may express the U arguments. As discussed in section 5.5, the choice of a bound
pronoun is determined by the semantic properties of the participants such as
[±individuated] and [±change of state]. In section 5.6, I focus on the U argument in
transitive constructions. I illustrate multiple ways in which the U argument can be
expressed. In section 5.7, the argument realization in intransitive constructions is
discussed. The single participant of the intransitive verb may be realized as the A or U
argument. In section 5.8, I present a diachronic analysis of the bound pronouns.
Finally, in section 5.9 an overview of the argument realization is given.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"
"GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES1113.5.2.1
Abui deictic demonstratives
Abui deictic precede the head constituent and indicate the spatial location of the head
constituent. As in other domains of Abui grammar, the demonstratives are organized
along the relative frame of reference based in either speaker or addressee. The
horizontal distance from the deictic centre is categorized by the axis
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. The vertical location is specified only for medial and distal
referents. As illustrated in (122), the noun sura ‘book’ combines with proximal deictic
demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). Following Levinson (2003), these deictic
demonstratives refer to the proximate location of a figure (F) with respect of the
viewpoint (V). In (a), the viewpoint is located at the speaker, while in (b); it is located at
the addressee. Often the addressee based demonstrative is used to draw addressee
attention. Mostly, the speaker based demonstrative is used.
(122) a. do

‘this book (near me)’b. tosuraPRX.AD

Levinson 2003:43-47). They refer to a location with alternating viewpoint (V) over
speaker or addressee (cf. Levinson 2003:24-61).
The second axis of Abui deictic systems is a horizontal axis that measures the
distance of F from the ground (G). As illustrated in (123), a nearby horizontal distance
of F is expressed with the deictic demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). I refer to
these deictic demonstratives as ‘proximal’. A distant position of F with respect to G is
indicated with the deictic demonstratives o (MD) and yo (MD.AD) that alternate V over
the speaker and the addressee. In (e), the far distance of F, further than the previous
one, is expressed with the deictic oro (DST). In the distal position the alternation of V
does not apply.

apply to proximate positions and is absolute (V cannot be alternated). The deictic
demonstratives in (124) refer to vertically oriented positions of F. Medial (less
proximate) positions are expressed with the low medial deictic ò (MD.L) and high medial
deictic ó (MD.H); distal positions are referred to with the low distal deictic wò (DST.L)
and high distal deictic wó (DST.H). The suprasegmental features of a deictic form112CHAPTER IIIindicate either high or low position: the high tone indicates the high position, while the
low tone the low position.

vowel /ɔ/. In spoken language, they are usually accompanied by a pointing gesture. The
pointing can be done by index finger, lips, eye movement, or chin. Note that the
relative frame of reference is neutralized in the distal position. The forms to and lo may
be related to the deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ and la ‘be.MD’ discussed in 3.4.5.3.
Deictic demonstratives occur in nominal and verbal domains indicating the
location of the referent or event respectively. This is illustrated in (125), where in the
deictic wò (DST.L) combines with the noun fala ‘house’ in (a), and with the verb sei
‘come down’ in (b). In (a), it indicates that the house is located below. In (b), the deictic
wò (DST.L) does not indicate the location of the referent he-aduo ‘his owner’ but refers
to the location of the event of ‘coming down’.

in section 4.4.3. For further information about the use of deictic demonstratives in the
verbal domain, see 6.3.2.
Note that the distal demonstratives based in speaker are neutrally pronounced with the mid tone. In case
when the vertical axis is employed, the high and low tone indicates the high and low position respectivelly.","[133, 134, 135]"
"GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES69From the presented data, we can construct a number of morphological
templates of Abui words. They are listed in (4) and represent the possible
morphological structures of Abui words. Abui words consist minimally of a free root
(i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes, either prefixes (ii) or suffixes
(iii), or with both (iv). They may form a complex stem with a bound root and be
combined with affixes (v). There are also bound roots. To form a word, bound roots
obligatorily combine with prefixes (vi), suffixes (vii) or other bound roots (viii).

word. Generally, free roots, illustrated in (i), are found in all grammatical categories.
Free and bound roots that combine with pronominal prefixes (ii, vi) are either nouns or
verbs. Only verbal roots combine with both pronominal prefixes and aspectual suffixes
(iii, iv, vii). Stems that consist of two roots, of which one is bound, are interpreted as
verbs.
In Abui, verb stems may display stem alternation. This is illustrated in (5), where
a number of stems show an alternation in their rime. The alternation affects either the
coda, as illustrated in the first and second row, or the nucleus, as illustrated in third row
where no coda is present.

scoop.CPLThe stem alternation encodes aspectual properties of the referred event. The
completive stems (CPL) refer to an event that has a final point. The inceptive stems (ICP)
choose the opposite perspective; they refer to an event that has an initial point. The70CHAPTER IIIstem alternation is a typical morphological characteristic of the verbal category. It is
discussed in detail in sections 3.4.2.3 and 6.1.1.1 as an aspect marking device.
In Abui, a number of bound roots cliticize to free forms to form a prosodic
word. They are aspectual particles te (INCP.C), se (INCP.I), si (PHSL.I), and ti (PHSL.C), and
the bound root ng ‘see’. As illustrated in (6), these forms can be characterized as
enclitics, as they are always attached to the preceding prosodic word.

[B04.019.01]NounsSemantic propertiesThe grammatical category of nouns contains items that refer to time-stable concepts:
persons, objects, places, and substances (cf. Payne, 1997:33; Schachter, 1985:7; Anward
et al., 1997:173). In Abui, the words given in (7) are identified as nouns, as they share
these semantic properties.

semantic as many items that are in some contexts identified as nouns (typically with
non-human referent) may also refer to events. Instead, the grammatical category of
nouns is identified by its distributional properties (see section 3.2.3).","[91, 92, 93]"
"2SG what
make
‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place
is asked in a construction that involves a relative clause:

Although both constructions have identical word orders, they are differentiated by their
intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES129(178) a. Simon nala nee

"1.10 Outline of the grammar and the presentation of data
This book is organized as follows. In chapter 2, I give a description of the Abui
phonological system. Morphology and grammatical categories are given in chapter 3. In
chapter 4, nouns and noun phrases are described. Chapter 5 discusses argument
realization. Verb phrases and clauses are described in chapter 6. The final two chapters
focus on multi-verb constructions. In chapter 7, I describe complex verbs; chapter 8
gives an overview of serial verb constructions. In the appendixes, a number of texts are
given as well as Abui-English and English-Abui wordlists.
Abui language data are presented in the following fashion, as illustrated in (22).",[46]

serial verb constructions allow for (mainly) completive verb stems to occur without
aspectual inflection, if another verb follows. As illustrated in (216), the completive stem
-ién ‘see’ may precede the verb naha ‘not be’ without aspectual inflection, as illustrated
in (a). However, when the verb ién ‘see’ is the final verb in a clause, it must carry
aspectual inflection, as illustrated in (b).

discourse. They are mainly monosyllabic forms (except for oro) that terminate in the
vowel /ɔ/. Demonstratives may combine with nouns, verbs on the phrase level, and
with clauses on the sentence level.
Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are the deictic demonstratives;
they always precede the head noun of an NP. Demonstratives that indicate the location
of the referent in discourse are anaphoric demonstratives; they follow the head noun.
In combination with verbs, the function of Abui demonstratives is analogous to the
nominal domain. When the demonstrative precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to
the location of the event. When it follows the head verb, it locates the event expressed
by the VP in discourse.
In this section, I first give an overview of Abui deictic demonstratives (see
3.5.2.1), and then discuss the anaphoric demonstratives (see 3.5.2.2). Details about the
usage of the demonstratives in the nominal domain can be found in section 4.4.3;
details about the functions of demonstratives in verbal domain in sections 6.3.2 and
6.4.3.","[132, 133]"
"8.1.2Composition and semantics of SVCsAbui serial verb constructions are divided into two types according to their
compositional and semantic properties. The SVCs of the first type consist of verbs
belonging to unrestricted set (see 8.2). These verbs are of equal grammatical status; they
do not show any dependency with respect to each other. This means that none of the
verbs in the first type of SVC is semantically ‘dominant’. As illustrated in (10) a number
of verbs combine refer to a single event. The ordering of verbs is conventionalized; it
reflects the established conventions about how things are done in Abui community:
(10)yaa mitnate-atangaananragostand.up-DURspeaktellsit‘negotiate’yaa mit nate-atanga ananra tikakfakgositspeak tellbreakmimestand.up-DURfengarrow‘negotiate about peace’‘bring to slaughter’take come injureIn Abui, the SVCs of the second type consist of restricted verb(s) combined
with unrestricted verb(s). The unrestricted verb is semantically ‘dominant’ as it
expresses the event. The restricted verb is semantically ‘dependent’ verb of the
structure in the sense that is has a grammatical function(s) rather than referring to an
event. The restricted verbs will be referred to as ‘minor’ verbs. The unrestricted verbs
will be referred to as ‘major verbs’. Aikhenvald (2006) refers to these two types of SVCs352CHAPTER VIIIwith the terms SYMMETRICAL and ASYMMETRICAL respectively. In my description of Abui, I
adopt these terms systematically.
In Abui asymmetrical SVCs, the minor verb either precedes or follows the
major verb, distinguishing two subtypes of asymmetrical SVCs (ASVC). This is
illustrated in as illustrated in (11). In the first column, the minor verb l ‘give’ precedes a
number of major verbs. The verb l ‘give’ has a grammatical function of expressing
benefactive (human) participants (for examples see 8.4.2.4). The verb kanri ‘finish’ is
the minor verb in the second column. It serves to express that an event has been
completed (for more examples see 8.3.1.1). Note that for the ease of presenting the full
glosses are omitted:
MINOR MAJOR
(11)-ltakeigivebite-l‘bite s.o.’tahai‘search s.o.’givesearch-lfeng‘injure, murder s.o.’giveinjure-llukgiverubMAJORMINORneekanrieatfinishyaarkanri‘finish going’fengkanri‘kill’injurefinishmarkanricookfinishgo.CPL‘massage s.o.’‘finish eating’finish‘finish cooking’In an ASVC, ordering of the major and minor verbs is grammaticalized. Therefore a
distinction will be made between ASVC.I and ASVC.II. In ASVC.I the minor verb(s) follow
the major verb(s). As discussed in 8.3, the minor verbs in ASVC.I express something
about the event properties such as aspect, manner, direction of the event, or mood.
In ASVC.II the minor verb(s) precede the major verb(s). The function of the
minor verb is to express the participants or describe event settings, as will be discussed
in 8.4. The position of the minor verb with respect to the position of the major verb
corresponds to the positions of aspectual markers, arguments and adverbs within Abui
clause. In a monoverbal clause, arguments and adverbs referring to the settings of the
event precede the verb. The aspectual markers and negation always follow (for details
see 6.4.1).
In Abui, there is a number of SVCs that display properties of both types. In
these SVCs, a number of verbs of ‘equal’ status combine with one or more major verbs.
These SVCs usually occur in narrative texts. The intonational properties of the SVC
complex are those of a monoverbal clause; the complex also is under scope of negation.
Such SVCs must be treated as ‘hybrid’ SVCs because they do not fit in the dichotomy
symmetrical vs. asymmetrical but have properties of both types. An example of a
‘hybrid’ SVC is given in (12). The verbs top ‘drop’ and taha ‘put on’ combine in an
ASVC.II. Both verbs share their arguments tut ‘shore’ co-indexed with the LOC prefix on
topi ‘drop’. They share the argument kapal loku ‘boats’ co-indexed with the distributiveSERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS353prefix on topi ‘drop’ with the first verb marang ‘come up’. The verbs marang ‘come
up’ and top ‘drop’ combine in a symmetrical SVC:
(12)kapal loku omarangboatcome.up.ICP shorePLMDtuttah-a
put.on.CPL-DURhe-ta-top-i
3II.LOC-DISTR.PAT-drop.CPL-PFV
‘the boats disembarked on the shore’[B05.029.01]Hybrid SVCs do not have a specific grammatical function. They seem to be ad-hoc
formed constructions depending on the pragmatic decisions of the speaker. Therefore I
will not report ‘hybrid’ SVCs in a separate section. Instead, I will point them out in
various sections.
Finally, there is a final remark to be made about the correlation between the
shared aspectual inflection and the compositional properties of a SVC. The verbs
combined in asymmetric SVCs share always their aspectual inflection. The inflection
appears on the final verb of a SVC regardless its ‘status’, hence, in ASVC.I, aspectual
inflection is attached to the minor verb, and in ASVC.II, aspectual inflection is attached
to the major verb. However, in symmetrical SVCs and hybrid SVCs the aspectual
inflections do not necessarily have to be shared by all verbs.","[374, 375, 376]"
"1.4Linguistic situationAbui is spoken in a linguistically diverse area where Austronesian and Papuan languages
are spoken. The Alor-Pantar area comprises approximately twenty five languages of
which only a number have been studied and documented. Map 2 shows both Papuan
and Austronesian languages spoken in the Alor-Pantar area. The immediate neighbours
of Abui are Kamang, Kui, Hamap, Klon, Kafoa, and Kabola. The map does not
mention Alor Malay, which has an increasing number of speakers in the area. The Abui
community is relatively large (16,000 speakers) compared to other ethnic groups in
Alor-Pantar area. Abui is reported to be the target of language shift in some of its
neighbouring languages such as Kafoa or Hamap (Katubi 2004).
In the recent past, a large number of settlements (practically all larger villages
such as Takalelang, Fanating, or Mainang) have been moved down from their
mountainous habitat either to the coast or to valleys. As a result of the resettlement,
many settlements are now located near markets, roads, or the sea where they have more
contact with other language communities. These factors stimulate the language shift of
the youngest generation towards Malay. The northern and western settlements such as
Takalelang, Welai, Fanating and Moru are most affected by the shift while small
mountainous settlements are least affected. In Takalelang, most children are brought up
in Malay, though they become more proficient in Abui when they grow up because it is
still the main language used between adults.
The situation is different in small settlements such as Tifol Afeng, where I
conducted a part of my fieldwork. Here, people are fluent in Malay, but in their daily
lives Abui is the main language and is used in communication with children. Children
remain monolingual in Abui until the age of five or six, the age at which they start
going to school.
In churches, the situation varies. In Takalelang, the protestant church uses
exclusively Indonesian; the catholic community uses the Indonesian liturgy. Abui is
used in parish council meetings and in worship where the priest is not present, such as
in Rosary worship that takes place in the houses of parish members. The first attempt
to translate the Gospel in Abui has been made by the late Julius Onkari Manimabi. It
resulted in a typescript of the first chapter of the Gospel according to Mark which is
included in the corpus.
In schools, Abui is banned. Despite official policy stimulating bilingual
education in Indonesia, in Alor education is monolingual and many teachers are
unaware of the official policy. To my knowledge, instruction materials in Abui have not
been made available or developed up to this day.
In the market, members of various Alorese ethnic groups address each other
using each other’s native terms, which is considered very good manners. Abui speakers
are identified by their pronunciation of the sound [k], which is pronounced as the
uvular stop [q] in word-internal and word-final positions.",[27]
"404CHAPTER VIII8.4.4.1
SVC with ma ‘be.PRX’
The speaker-proximate event location is expressed with the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’. An
example is given in (168) where the minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ combines with the verb yei
‘fall’ sharing a single argument. It refers to the location near the speaker where the
referred object ‘fell’:
(168) di
ma
ha-yei?
3A
be.PRX 3II.PAT-fall
‘did it fall here (by me)?’[B05.083.02]Although both verbs in (168) have each their own argument, both pronouns expressing
the arguments have the same reference. The free pronoun di (3A) is the A argument of
the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’ while the PAT prefix ha- is the U argument of the verb yei
‘fall’. The minor verb in (168) expresses an event location while in (169) it expresses
potential modality. The minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ expresses an attitude of the speaker
towards the event expressed by the major verb. The major verb is inflected for aspect
with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV).

3I.REC-leave.for-IPFV[B07.019.02]8.4.4.2
SVC with ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
The minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ encodes the addressee-proximate location of the event.
This is illustrated in example (170) analogous to previous (168) where the minor verb ta
‘be.PRX.AD’ combines with the verb -yei ‘fall’ sharing a single argument:
(170) di

3A
be.PRX.AD 3II.PAT-fall
‘did he fall near you?’[B05.083.02]In (171) both proximal deictic verbs are contrasted in the same SVC. Note that the
minor verb ma ‘be.PRX’ used in a question presupposes the same location of the
speaker with the addressee as illustrated in (a). However, the minor verb ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
refers simply to the location of the addressee, regardless the location of speaker.
Logically the speaker is located elsewhere than the addressee in such situation because
otherwise the verb ma ‘be.PRX’ would be used:

‘is it raining on you (there where you are)?’[B05.083.01]SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS4058.4.4.3
SVC with la ‘be.MD’
The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ expresses a medial (less proximate) event location with
respect to the speaker. The construction is used in situations when the speech
participants talk about events occurring in other locations that are distant from them.
This is illustrated in (100) where the speaker inquires whether the addressee is going to
stay over night in the harbour town encoded as la ‘be.MD’ or come back to the village
where they are both located at that time:
(172) a
la
taa re a-wai?
2SG be.MD lie
or 2SG.PAT-turn
‘will you sleep there or come back?’[B04.009.02]In example (173) the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used in a very complex utterance that
uses a number of SVCs. Ignoring the first two clauses, in the third clause the minor
verb la ‘be.MD’ combines with the major verb yaari ‘go’, together with the other two
minor verbs pa ‘touch’ and ng ‘see’ expressing the motion towards a proximate
recipient. The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is used to stress that the location where the
speaker ‘arrived’ is actually distant from his location at the moment of speech:
(173) di

be.MD=see go.CPL-PFV
‘he was getting ready for it to come when I arrived to him there’[B07.037.03]The location verb SVC with the verb la ‘be.MD’ has a functional extension expressing
modality. It expresses speaker’s opinion that the event expressed with the major verb
happens ‘autonomously’ according its own will. The event is presented as ‘distant’ from
the speaker as illustrated in (174). The addressee is expressed as the A argument of the
minor verb la ‘be.MD’ and major verbs we ‘leave’ and me ‘come’. The speaker expresses
his lack of understanding why the addressee just keeps walking around:
(174) a
la
we la
me do, a
nala tahai?
2SG be.MD leave be.MD come PRX 2SG what search
‘you, you only go and come, so what are you searching?’[B05.033.03]In fact the minor verb la ‘be.MD’ indicates that the reported event is performed outside
the deictic centre, and ‘autonomously’ of speaker’s intention and awareness of its
reason; however, this construction can be analyzed as realis marking strategy as it
confirms that the event is truly happening. This is illustrated in (175) where (A) inquires
whether (B) is already asleep. (B) uses la ‘be.MD’ to express that he is unable to sleep.
He says that he is just lying ‘there’, while he is in the same location with the speaker.","[426, 427, 428]"
"388CHAPTER VIIIGeneric verb m may serve as a minor verb in SVCs encoding two grammatical
functions: (i) In instrumental SVCs it expresses the instrument participant as its U
argument; the human A argument is shared. It is glossed as ‘take’. (ii) In interior
location SVCs it expresses either the interior of objects such as ‘house’ or the interior
‘location’ of animates where cognitive and emotional processes take place, similar to
English ‘heart’ or Indonesian/Malay hati ‘liver’. In these constructions the verbal form
m ‘be in’ is nominalized as it serves often expresses a complement of the major verb.19
The generic verb m ‘take, be in’ is not a proper prosodic word. Therefore it
mostly combines with the generic verb ì ‘put’ in a completive stem in both SVCs. The
completive stem mi ‘take, be in’ is possibly related to the deictic verb ma ‘be.PRX’
discussed in 8.4.4.1 and me ‘come’ (see 8.3.2.3, 8.4.6.2). In the following paragraphs
both functions of the minor verb mi ‘take, be in’ are discussed.
INSTRUMENTAL SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The minor verb mi ‘take’ serves to
express the instrument, typically combining with two arguments. The A argument is
shared with the major verb, while the U argument expresses the instrument. An
example of an instrumental SVC is given in (122):
(122) ama
kawen
mi bataa
person machete take wood
‘one cuts wood with a machete’tukong
cutThe minor verb mi ‘take’ shares its A argument ama ‘person’ with tukong ‘cut’. Both
verbs have each their own U argument; mi ‘take’ combines with the U argument kawen
‘machete’, tukong ‘cut’ combines with bataa ‘wood’. The instrumental SVC is used as
valence-increasing device as the transitive mi adds the third argument to the
construction.
The form mi has been grammaticalized on clausal level to a conjunction marker
establishing ‘instrument-like’ relationship between two clauses. In (123), the first clause
serves as a complement expressing the ‘instrument’ which caused the plate to be
broken. Note the form mi ‘take’ also occurs in instrumental SVC with the verb batek
‘throw, hit’. The U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ is da-táng ‘his arm’, the A argument
di (3A) is shared with the major verb.

verb mi ‘be at’ (cf. Haan; 2001);in Blagar mi is a locative postposition (Steinhauer, 1991:215), there is also an
inalienable noun -omi ‘inside’ (Steinhauer, 1991:215); in Kabola, there is a prefix mi that can attach to verbs to
derive applicative verbs (Stokhof, 1987:635), and a locative marker mi ‘be in’, however, this form displays
some verbal properties as it may combine with aspectual markers (cf. Stokhof, 1987:641,643); in Kaera, there
is a postposition mi serving as an oblique marker and a transitive verb ming ‘be at location’ (cf. Klamer, to
appear:21); in Klon mi is a verb meaning ‘be at’ or ‘place’ (cf. Baird, to appear:11), and has grammaticalized
uses as applicative marker and a conjunction.","[410, 411]"
"12372CHAPTER VIII8.3.5.1
SVC with na / ni ‘be like.PRX’
As a minor verb na/ni ‘be like.PRX’ is often a part of a complex verb. Consider now
(73) where the minor verb ni-l ‘make like this’ combines with the major verb fur
‘swallow’. It refers to the manner of the ‘swallowing’ that is expressed by the quantifier
verb tafuda ‘be all’. The LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) attached to the index verb co-indexes
the first part of the serial construction as a complement.

[B02.094.14:17]Note that fur ‘swallow’ is inflected for aspect. Both verbs also express their U argument
with pronominal prefixes. The verb fur combines with the PAT prefix that refers to the
form tafuda ‘be all’. The verb nil ‘make like this’ combines with the LOC prefix he- that
refers to the manner in which the ‘swallowing’ was performed. Note that the manner is
not expressed here by a separate clause.
SVC with index verbs has a pragmatic extension illustrated in (74).13 The verb
ni-d-i ‘be this way’ is serialized with the verb làk-e ‘leave for’. It refers to the
complement clause marked with the brackets. At the same time it marks the end of the
clause chain. The clause chain that follows usually start with the resumptive verbal form
henil ‘make like this’, derived also from the index verb ni ‘be like.PRX’.

[B06.036.03:36]More examples of the index verbs occurring in tail-head linkage can be found in the
text appendix. The alternation of the verb -l ‘give’ and -d ‘hold’ deriving the complex
verb indicates orientation on either actor or undergoer participant. The generic verb -l
‘give’ occurring in the ‘tail’ of a clause chain is typically alternated with the completive
stem -r ‘reach’ which occurs in the ‘head’ of the subsequent clause chain.
8.3.5.2
SVC with wa / wi ‘be like.MD’
The minor verb wa/wi ‘be like.MD’ refer to the way or manner in which the event was
performed. This type of manner may be considered as ‘medial’, it is obvious to both
speech participants; however, this type is often used in questions, because the speaker
wants to indicate lower awareness of the manner in which an event was performed. The
13 This strategy is in fact a form of tail head linkage (THL), a typical feature of for many Papuan languages (cf.
de Vries, 2005). In Abui usually last clause is recapitulated in THL constructions. The final verb of
recapitulated clause combines with an complex index verb.","[394, 395]"
"3.5.7Question wordsThe last closed grammatical category contains question words. In Abui, question words
are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.
In (b), it occurs in the position of the U argument, questioning the complement of ong
‘make’.

divided into three formally distinct sets. Pronominal prefixes are polysemous. They
combine with verbs to express the Undergoer (U) arguments and with nouns to express
possessors.4
Pronominal prefixes from all three sets combine with verbs to express or coindex the Undergoer (U) arguments. The U arguments identified as LOC (location) are
expressed with set I, REC (recipient) with set II, and PAT (patient) with set III (for more
details, see section 5.5). Pronominal prefixes from sets I and III combine also with
nouns. They express or co-index possessors (see 4.2). The prefixes from set III serve to
express possessor in inalienable possessive relations (INAL), set I is used to express
possessor in alienable possessive relations (AL). The prefixes from set I are
polysemous, they refer to locations and possessors. In fact, possessors are encoded as a
‘location’ of the possessed entity.5 An inalienably possessed body part is marked in the
same way as a PAT(ient) argument because both are fully controlled by the POSSESSOR
Polysemous pronominal prefixes used in both nominal and verbal domain are found in other related Alor
Pantar languages such as Teiwa (Klamer and Kratochvíl, 2006; Klamer, In prep.), and Adang (cf. Haan
2001:38, 46). Steltenpool and Stap (1959) report polysemous prefixes for Ekari (referred to as Kapauku), a
language from the Wissel Lakes-Kemandoga group of the TNG family. They observe a similarity between
possessor marking on body parts and kinship terms and the object marking: ‘considering the extremely
passive nature of the acquisition of such ‘possession’ it is not a coincidence that these prefixes are reminiscent
of the passive voice’ (Steltenpool and Stap, 1958:20, translation F.K.).
5 Polysemous pronominal possessor and benefactive markers are also found in Lower Grand Valley Dani
(Bromley 1981:190). Lichtenberk (2002) and Margetts (2004) argue for possessive-benefactive polysemy in
broader cross-linguistic perspective.

DISTRte-to-ta-In the table, prefixes are organized according to their reference. The egophoric prefixes,
referring to the speech act participants are listed first. In egophoric plural forms there is
no distinction between sets I and III; while set II displays free alternation in plural
forms (1PL.I and 2PL). The allophoric prefixes refer to other than the speech act
participants. In allophoric reference, two subtypes are distinguished: 3I and 3II. The 3I
prefixes share the same referent with the A argument within the same domain. The 3II
prefixes do not share the same referent with the A argument within that domain.
The referential domain of allophoric and distributive prefixes is maximally a clause. In
complex structures with the intersective linker ba (LNK) as illustrated in (28), the 3I
prefix refers to the nearest NP within the structure. In this case, the 3I possessive prefix
de- (3I.AL) co-indexes the NP Timo as possessor and the A argument of the verb on
‘make’.

clause.16 This position is marked by an pause in intonation that follows the focussed
constituent. This pragmatic structure may interact with the focus SVC. The minor verb
and its U argument are extracted from the core of the clause (realized as contiguous
SVC) and placed in the clause-initial pragmatic position. An NP can be extracted to the
focus position without leaving any pronominal trace. This is illustrated in (117) where
the NP kawen ‘machete’ occurs clause-initially.

[B02.174.00:12]The status of ne-d-o in (118) is puzzling. It might be analysed as grammaticalized to a
focus pronoun, just like the form ne-d-e. The pause in intonation between nedo and na
in (118) may be used as evidence supporting such an analysis.17 In my analysis, I choose
The left edge of the clause is a typical location of focussed constituent also in other Papuan languages, as
argued by Donohue (2005:187).
17 In fact, a similar construction occurs in the neighbouring language Kabola (cf. Stokhof: 1987:647) where a
pronoun combined with a morpheme -ri, which is analyzed as a case marker, may be fronted to a pragmatic
position as illustrated in (2). Interestingly, the morpheme -ri may be combined with the inceptive aspectual
marker so.

form ne-d-o as a verb phrase that appears in the clause-initial pragmatic position. As
illustrated in (119), the pragmatic position has a nominalising effect on the verb phrase
occurring in it. The pragmatic position marks any constituent appearing in it as given.
The resulting nominal ne-d-o has a lot in common with pronouns. The pragmatic
position does not allow free pronouns, which cannot be extracted from the clause.

demonstrative do (PRX), as illustrated in (121). Anaphoric demonstratives do not
combine with pronominal prefixes, unlike nouns, verbs and numerals.18

The generic verb m is glossed either as ‘take’ or ‘be in’ depending on the grammatical
context in which it is used. The decisive factors are the type and animacy value of its
arguments. In contexts where the minor verb combines with an animate A argument it
is glossed as ‘take’, in other contexts as ‘be in’.","[409, 410]"

roots share the same semantic core and have a similar place of articulation. They can be
phonologically characterized as alveodental liquids (l, r), non-labial nasals (n, ng), and
unvoiced alveodental obstruents (t, s). The alternation reflects the internal temporal
structure of the referred event (inner aspect, Aktionsart). An event referred to with the
single semantic core is viewed either as having an endpoint (completive), or an initial100CHAPTER IIIpoint (inceptive).8 In (85) the alternation of the generic verbs l ‘give’ and r ‘reach’ is
illustrated.

‘Fani gave me a certain book, books’Generic roots have a number of grammatical functions in Abui. Their first
function is that of a predicate in a monoverbal clause. This is illustrated in (86), where
the generic root ì ‘put’ is used as the main predicate of the clause bataa do ì ‘the wood
is put (down)’.

[B02.057.22:55]The generic roots combine with pronominal prefixes and aspectual suffixes, as other
verbal roots. This is illustrated in (87), where the root ì ‘put’ combines with the prefix
no- (1SG.REC) and with durative suffix -a (DUR). It shares the A argument ama ba nala
kapuk adua ‘tailor’ with the verb mi ‘take’ in the first clause.

[B10.051.06]The generic roots occur frequently in serial verb constructions. An example of
the root ì ‘put’ used in a serial verb construction is given in (88). It is serialized with
three verbs. The first one is the verb mi ‘take’ that combines with the U argument sura
‘book’. The second one is the position verb tai/tah- ‘put on’, which combines with the
U argument meja ‘table’. The third one is the generic root ng ‘see’ that encodes the
direction towards the table.

[B07.034.06]The glosses of the generic roots l/r and ng/n stresses the distinction [±completive], while the gloss of s/t
stresses the distinction [±inceptive]. The glossing is somewhat misleading because it does not specify the
aspectual properties of the [−completive] and [−inceptive] roots. In fact, the roots t/s can be glossed as s ‘lie
down’ and t ‘lie down.CPL’ to match the alternation [±completive] used for the roots l/r and ng/n. I decided
not to use these glosses because they are too large to gloss a monosegmental root.
8GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES101In serial verb constructions, the generic roots often serve to realize and mark certain
types of participants such as benefactives, recipients, or instruments. In (89), the root ì
‘put’ is serialized with the motion verb we ‘leave’. Consider the situation where the
speaker is about to leave because it is getting late and he should have left before. In
those cases the construction given below can be used. The speaker refers to the
necessity of his departure. It is encoded as ‘put’ on him that he should leave. In such a
case, the root ì ‘put’ has a modal reading.
(89)ne-ìwe1SG.LOC-put leave
‘I have to leave’[B05.045.04]Serial verb constructions with generic roots such as those in (88) and (89) are discussed
in detail in chapter 8, in particular in section 8.4.2.
Evidence of the verbhood of the generic verb a ‘be at’ is provided in (90). The
verb a ‘be at’ combines with the distributive prefix to- (DISTR.REC) and is serialized with
the verb mit-i ‘sit’.

‘her parents are still alive’, lit.: ‘her mother and father, they sit together’ [B01.083.02:57]The generic verb a ‘be at’ is related to the durative suffix -a (DUR) and derives many
stative verbs from bound verbal roots (see 7.2.1).
The generic verb d ‘hold’ can be used as a single predicate as in (91). The verb d
‘hold, get’, or here ‘acquire’, combines with the perfect suffix -u (PRF).

aspectual inflection, to satisfy phonological constrains.

with the PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT). The A argument na (1SG) is shared.

[B06.025.05]Generic verbs combine with other roots to derive complex verbs (CVs). A
simple example is given in (97), where the generic roots ì ‘put’ and r ‘reach’ derive
complex verbs from the adjective root kul ‘white’ (see 3.5.1).

3.4.5.3
Deictic verbs
Deictic verbs point to locations. There are five monosylabic deictic stems that are
identified as verbs, because they may combine with aspectual inflection. The aspectual
suffix -i (PFV) identifies the form ma ‘be.PRX’ in (98) as a verb. The verb ma ‘be.PRX’GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES103occurs in serial verb construction with the verb -rik ‘hurt, be ill’. It indicates that the
event expressed by the verb -rik ‘hurt, be ill’ indeed occurred. It is followed by an
intonational break marked here with a comma. Together with the first clause it serves
as a complement of the verb uk-d-a and it is co-indexed with the LOC prefix he(3II.LOC).

‘it surprises me that you are pulling the bow and (it) already hurts you’ [B09.004.04:03]However, deictic verbs mostly occur in serial verb constructions, and only in few cases
they are inflected for aspect or person. This makes them very adverb-like elements, also
due to their semantics.
The deictic verbs point to locations with respect to the speech participants. In
this respect, they are closely related to demonstratives discussed in 3.5.2. The reference
points anchoring the deictic centre are located in speech participants. For SPEAKER
BASED DEICTIC VERBS, as the name suggests, the reference point of the deictic centre is
based at the speaker. For ADDRESSEE BASED DEICTIC VERBS, the reference point of the
deictic centre is based at the addressee. Once the deictic centre is established a threeway distinction can be made along the contrast PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. For the
distal locations, the distinction between the speaker based and addressee based deictic
verbs is not relevant. An overview of the deictic verbs is given in (99):

be.MD.AD
‘be further from you’e. ya
be.DST
‘be far from me/you/DC’The deictic verbs ma ‘be.PRX’ and ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ in (99) express proximity to the deictic
centre, located at one of the speech participants. Both verbs can be translated as ‘be
here’ but the interpretation of ‘here’ depends on the location of the deictic centre at the
speaker or at the addressee. The deictic verbs la ‘be.MD’ and fa ‘be.MD.AD’ express a
medial distance from the deictic centre, located at the speaker or addressee. The deictic
verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses remoteness and distance from the deictic centre.
Deictic verbs always occur in intransitive constructions. In most cases, they
combine with other verbs in serial verb constructions. They serve as minor verbs
expressing the location (or modality) of the referred event. This is illustrated in (100), in104CHAPTER IIIa situation where the speaker inquires whether the addressee intends to stay the night in
the harbour or come back to the village. The verb la ‘be.MD’ refers to the location of
‘sleeping’, which is in the ‘harbour’, that is less proximate to the speech participants at
the moment of speaking.

a similar serial construction. Each of the deictic verbs is serialized with the verb sei
‘come down’. It indicates the position of the speech participant:

Positional verbs
Positional verbs are items that express the position of two participants in a similar way
as prepositions/postpositions in other languages. In Abui, these items are identified as
verbs by two properties: (i) they may combine with one or two pronominal prefixes,
and (ii) they display stem alternation. An overview of positional verbs is given in (102).

clauses such as in (240). It has a nominalising effect on the complement clause which
may be analyzed as a nominal, because it expresses the U argument of the verb ng ‘see’.
The verb ng ‘see’ combines with the verb we ‘leave’ in allative serial verb construction
(see 8.4.2.1). Note, that there is no specialized complementizer in Abui, but the
complement clauses occur in syntactic position of an argument and often combine with
anaphoric demonstratives that seem to serve as nominalizing devices.

function. As illustrated in the following fragment from the narrative moku ayoku, the
information presented in one clause chain is resumed in the initial part of the next
clause chain and marked as background information with an anaphoric demonstrative.
The direct speech given in (242) is resumed in the first clause of (243) and marked with
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) as background information. The clause ya si-a
‘fetch water’ serves as a complement clause (CC) of the verb generic n ‘see’ that

"6.1.1Aspectual inflectionIn Abui, aspect is encoded by verb stem alternation and by aspectual markers that are
attached to a verb stem. Abui verbs alternate their stems to encode aspectual properties
of the referred event (see 6.1.1.1). Abui verb stems combine with aspectual markers
(suffixes and particles, see 3.5.4). Aspectual suffixes and particles view the internal
structure of the event with respect of the moment of speech. The suffixes view the210CHAPTER VIevent from inside; they indicate the initial, and final boundary, or the absence of a
boundary (see 6.1.1.2-6.1.1.6). Aspectual particles view events from outside (see 6.1.1.76.1.1.8); they indicate the point just before the start or just before the end (inchoative
aspect), or the point right after the start or right after the end of an event (phasal
aspect).
6.1.1.1
Verb stem alternation
In Abui, verb stems alternate to reflect the internal temporal structure of the encoded
event (Aktionsart). As summed up in (2), verb stem alternation encodes different
phases of an event and distinguishes between atelic (continuative) and telic events
(completive and inceptive).1(2)VERB STEMGLOSSREFERENCEITEMSCOMPLETIVE(CPL)event with end pointmanyCONTINUATIVE (CNT)event with neither starting nor end pointmanyINCEPTIVEevent with starting pointfew(ICP)In section 3.4.2.3, I have introduced three morphological classes of verbs. The
members of the first class do not alternate and I will not pay any more attention to
them here.
The members of the second class show alternation in the coda (of the final
syllable) of their stem. The completive stems for the second class must combine with
aspectual inflection in final position (see also 8.1.1); in non-final position it may occur
without aspectual inflection if the coda is phonologically allowed in word-final position.
The non-restricted stem has aspectual properties of both continuative and inceptive
verb stems.
In (3), the class II.a (k~t) is exemplified with the verb batek/batet ‘strike’. The
completive stem batet may occur either as a medial stem (non-final) or it must carry
aspectual inflection, as illustrated in (b-c).

Aspectual inflection
In Abui, verbs are forms that may carry aspectual inflection. This is a unique feature of
the verbal grammatical category. In (38), the verb làk ‘leave for’ combines with
perfective suffix -i (PFV) in (a). In (b), it combines with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV):
(38)a. nalàk-ib. na1SG leave.for-PFV
‘I have gone away’làk-e1SG leave.for-IPFV
‘I am going away’3.4.2.2
Person inflection
In Abui, verbs may carry person inflection (pronominal prefixes expressing the U
argument). As discussed in section 3.2.3, also nouns may combine with pronominal
prefixes from set I and III. Only prefixes from set II are used exclusively with verbs.
Any item that combines with a prefix from set II is automatically identified as a verb.
An example is given in (39). In (a), the verb làk ‘leave for’ combines with pronominal
prefix ho- (3II.REC) expressing the U argument of the verb together with the noun
Simon. The first person participant affects Simon by going away, and Simon is
identified as recipient (human goal) of going. The construction refers to a situation in
which Simon is stepped on by the speaker (see also 6.2.2.3). In (b), the verb làk ‘leave
for’ combines with the pronominal prefix no- (1SG.REC) expressing the U argument that
refers to the speaker. The construction has a ‘reflexive’ reading of ‘returning oneself’
because both pronominal forms are coreferential (see also 6.2.5.1).

‘I stepped on Simon’no-làk1SG 1SG.REC-leave.for
‘I go back home’Some verb stems are bound and require obligatory person inflection. This is illustrated
in (40). The verb stem wel ‘pour’ requires person inflection. It refers to ‘washing’ when
used in a transitive A-UPAT construction and to ‘flowing’ or ‘pouring’ when used in a
A≡UPAT experiencer construction.

3.4.2.3
Verb stem alternation
Another morphological property unique of verbs is stem alternation.7 There are two
morphological types of stem alternation, listed in (41), which divided Abui verbs in
Verb stem alternation related to the inner aspect properties of referred events is found in other Papuan
languages (Foley 1986). For instance in Telefol and Kiwai two alternating stems refer to different events with7GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES83three classes. This classification is used in the dictionary to indicate inflectional
properties of verb stems. The first class shows no alternation, it includes both native
and loan stems. The second class is characterized by an alternation affecting the coda of
the verb stem. This type of alternation is relatively productive and predictable. The
third class is characterized by an alternation affecting the entire rime (of the final
syllable). With exception of the productive type III.a (a ~ i), this alternation is not
predictable and is not productive. However, the verbs that show this irregular
alternation are verbs used with high frequency, such as mara ‘go up’. The verbs
displaying each type of alternation are listed below in this section.","[104, 105, 106]"

‘no, I am just lying’ [B07.028.03]The minor verb la ‘be.MD’ is also used to refer to ‘suddenness’ of an event. The event

SVC with fa ‘be.MD.AD’
The minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ refers to an event location distant from the addressee.
The use of fa implicates realis mode as it marks ‘truly’ occurring events. As realis mode
marker it has also contrastive epistemic function identifying that the information is
either new or unknown to the addressee. The verb fa corresponds roughly in its use to
English ‘actually’. In (101) it is contrasted with two other deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
and la ‘be.MD’ combined in all cases with the major verb sei ‘come down’:

of a questioned car. Note that the deictic verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ corresponds in usage to the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).

addressee. It seems to be a general strategy in Abui, as in most or all languages, that the
temporal and discourse dimension and their operators are mostly transferred from theSERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS407spatial dimension and referred to with spatial operators such as deictic verbs. Another
example is given in (179) where the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ combines with rul ‘take off’:

SVC with ya ‘be.DST’
The minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses an event location distal from both speech
participants. Its use is illustrated in (180) where the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ combines
with the verb -iel ‘roast’. In (a) the speaker is located outside the shelter where he is
roasting a fish for the addressee. In such context, he is marked ‘distal’ from the event
location. In (b) the minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ is used because the speaker is roasting a
fish for the addressee inside the shelter, while the addressee is outside:

3II.PAT-roast[B05.042.01]The usage of the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ is extended to narratives. There it has an
evidential function marking the event as non-witnessed by the speaker but as one that
really happened expressing in fact realis mode. This is illustrated in the narrative
fragment in (181):

"1.5Earlier descriptions of the Abui languageAs mentioned in 1.3, Abui language was briefly studied by Martha M. Nicolspeyer. Her
dissertation includes an appendix containing a number of glossed texts in Abui as well
as an Abui-Dutch wordlist, but no grammatical analysis. A first linguistic description
was Stokhof (1984).4 In his analysis, Stokhof first defines the area where Abui is spoken
and shows its relationship with other non-Austronesian languages of the Alor-Pantar
area. The descriptive part of the paper is based on a text from Du Bois that describes
an uprising in September 1918.
Stokhof gives a basic overview of Abui phonology as spoken in Ateng Melang.
It differs from Takalelang Abui phonology (as described in this book) in having the
phonemes /g, v/, and a number of vowel sequences /uɛ, ɑu, ɑɔ, ɔu, ɔɛ/ (cf. Stokhof,
1984:116).
In nominal morphology, two types of possessive inflection are identified:
inalienable and alienable. Inalienably possessed nouns are semantically characterized as
referring to body parts or kinship relations (1984:120). Pronominal prefixes containing
*t- are described as having generic reference. In verbal morphology, Stokhof
distinguishes free and bound verb stems. Bound verb stems obligatorily combine with a
pronominal prefix (1984:124).
In syntax, Stokhof claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent
fronting is mentioned (1984:137). In an NP, modifiers follow heads in the order:
attribution, quantification, specification (1984:139). In a clause, the phrases expressing
temporal settings of an event precede the arguments. The sketch provides rich
comparative data with other Alorese languages such as Kabola or Woisika, as well as
Timorese Bunak.",[28]

Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.
NOUNS. Abui nouns are only identified unambiguously by their referential properties
when they have animate referents. Inanimate nouns are typically underspecified for
number, shape, or size; in other words, their reference is generic. Many lexical items are
categorially indetermined and may refer to objects and substances as well as to events.
Abui nouns are divided in two groups by possessive inflection. Inherently
possessed nouns require possessive inflection. Semantically these are body parts and
kinship terms. This distinction is illustrated in (3), where the bound nominal stem min
‘nose’ combines with the inalienable possessive prefix na- (1SG.INAL). In (b), the noun
fala ‘house’ belongs to the second group of optionally possessed nouns. The possessive
prefix ne- (1SG.AL) marks the alienable possession. In third person, the possessor is
optionally expressed with a noun that precedes the possessum denoting noun, as
illustrated in (c).

(PROPOSS), with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives
(DEICT), modifier nouns (NMOD), stative verbs (V), adjectives (ADJ), quantifiers (QUANT),
and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) in a fixed order, as illustrated in (4).
(4)NP Æ(DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)Optionally, an NP may be modified by a modifier linked to the head noun with the
linker ba (LNK); typically, a relative clause (RC). The linked modifier may either precede
or follow the head noun as illustrated in (5). It forms a single intonational unit with the
modified NP. In (a), the modifier clause precedes the head noun bataa ‘wood’. In (b),
the modifier clause follows the head noun. The second order is more common.

Controlling and volitional participants of an event are identified as actors. Actors are
realized as A arguments with NPs and/or free pronouns. This is illustrated in (6). In (a),
the A argument is expressed with the NP maama ‘father’ and the free pronoun di (3A);
in (b), the A argument is expressed by the free pronoun di (3A).

arguments with NPs and/or bound pronouns. This is illustrated in (7). In (a), the U
argument is expressed with the NP wil ‘child’ and with the bound pronoun ho(3II.REC). In (b), the U argument is expressed with the bound pronoun no- (1SG.REC).

‘I feel hot’There are three sets of bound pronouns that express arguments with a specific
reference. Their distribution is determined by the semantic features of the participantsINTRODUCTION15such as [±change of state] and [±individuated]. In (8), the U argument of the verb loi
‘put far, chase’ is realized in a number of constructions.

‘Simon chases me’DISTR.REC-3II.PAT-put.farIn (a), the U argument nala nuku ‘something’ is co-indexed as LOC; it has a specific
non-individuated referent that must be understood in a very broad sense as ‘purpose’ or
‘reason’. In (b), the same U argument is co-indexed as REC; its referent is
[+individuated] and probably a human or some other clearly distinguished referent. In
(c), the U argument kaai ‘dog’ is affected by the event chasing, and effectively chased
away. While in (a) and (b) the meaning of the verb loi was translated as ‘bark’, the
translation ‘chase’ is more appropriate in (c). As illustrated in (d), the use of the PAT
bound pronoun is not felicitous to refer to first and second person participants.
Instead, the benefactive serial construction with the generic verb l ‘give’ must be used.
The first person participant is expressed as the U argument of the verb l ‘give’. Note
that the verb loi ‘put far’ combines with two bound pronouns. The distributive form
to- (DISTR.REC) refers to a plural number of participants that are ‘recipients’ of chasing.
The PAT form ha- (3II.PAT) indicates that a single participant is chased. The first person
prefix may not appear here. The combinations of prefixes in double U transitive
constructions are restricted.
Depending on its semantic properties a single participant of an event may be
expressed as different types of arguments of the same verb. In (9), the single participant
of the event of ‘leaving (towards a DC)’ is expressed as actor (a), experiencer (b), and
undergoer (c).

events with distinct telic properties. There are three basic distinctions made depending
on the inner temporal structure of the event. Inceptive stems (ICP) indicate events that
have an initial point. Completive stems (CPL) indicate events that have a final point.
Continuative stems (CNT) indicate events that are viewed as having neither initial nor
final point.

are discussed in section 7.2.1 and exemplified in (30)-(38), where I gloss the form tak as
‘empty’. The meaning shifts illustrated in (68) may obscure the derivation path. To
avoid confusion and discussion elsewhere in this book, I use the simplified glossing
instead of the full glosses given in this section.
In this analysis, I take the conservative view that the segments of a verb can
only be analysed as morphemes when there is positive evidence to do so. A
morphologically complex verb that is composed of GVs will only be identified as such
under the strict condition that it occurs in a paradigm with other complex verbs which
shows a minimal contrast in form coupled to a systematic contrast in meaning. This is
why the paradigms discussed below are crucial. There are also many Abui verbs that do
not show systematic form/ meaning contrast with other verbs (see 3.4.4). It may be
that such verbs are morphologically simple forms, but it may also be that some of them
are derived forms whose semantics have shifted so much over time that there is no
evidence of their former morphological composition.
In 7.3.1, the CVs consisting of two generic roots are discussed. My data covers
the best the homogenous CVs that consists of three generic roots. This substantial
subtype is discussed in section 7.3.2. The CVs that consist of more than three generic
roots are discussed in section 7.3.3.","[342, 343]"

participants. As illustrated in (132) an NP is linked with the linker ba (LNK) to the
adverb el ‘before’ that is followed by the anaphoric demonstrative lo (MD). The
construction is an answer to the question ‘what are you roasting there?’ The speaker
says that the fish was actually a bit ‘smelly’ and explains ‘so that is why I am roasting it’.

anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD) that indicates a referent ‘specific’ only for the
speaker. That means that the referent is located only in speaker’s own ‘discourse’ and is
not shared with the addressee. In (136), a fragment of a narrative is presented. A man
ate some of the fragrant betel nut that belonged to his wife and gives this as an
explanation to a giant snake, from which he tries to steal some betel nuts.

[B02.073.07:49]In fact, the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) serves to introduce a new referent into
discourse and its anaphoricity is questionable. I consider it as anaphoric only within the
discourse of the speaker. It encodes the subtle referential distinction that the presented
referent is only new for the addressee but specific for the speaker. In (137), the use of
the anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC) is illustrated. Consider the conversation fragment
where one participant inquires whether addressee’s wife cooks meat. The answer is that
‘some fish’ is being cooked. The NP afu hu ‘some fish’ refers to a ‘fish’ that is only in
discourse of the speaker in A, and thus specific; however, it is not shared with the
speaker in Q for who the information is new.","[137, 138, 139]"
"8.2.3Synonymous SVCsSynonymous SVCs consist of a pair of verbs that have either almost synonymous
meaning or typically occur together. 7 Synonymous SVCs are a subset of parallel
expressions, found in Abui. Parallel expressions are typically used in ritual speech or in
stylistically elaborate expressions. These expressions are built up from two elements
forming a pair. The first element referring to an entity or event is paraphrased by the
second element that is either synonymous or belonging to the same semantic field.
Each element in the pair can be composed of one word or more words (a phrase).
These parallel expressions seem to be lexicalized or at least highly conventionalized.
They are sometimes referred to by the term ‘parallelism’ (cf. Fox, 1988; Kuiper, 1996).
An example of a synonymous SVC is given in (27) containing two synonymous SVCs:

became adult’
[B05.023.02]Both SVCs are symmetrical. They consist of unrestricted verbs that belong to an open
class. As mentioned earlier, the restrictions here are lexical or conventional, but not
grammatical. The first synonymous SVC consists of the verbs -t ‘lie’ and -wel ‘pour’.
Both verbs share their A argument expressed with the free pronoun na (1SG). The U
argument is also shared and morphologically realized by a bound pronoun on each of
the verbs. The second synonymous SVC contains the verbs fokda ‘get big’ and finri
‘become old’. Both verbs share their U argument expressed as the prefix he-(3II.LOC).
The pronoun refers to the previous clause.",[380]
"2SG must go
‘you must go’[B05.065.04]Some more ambiguous lexical items are listed in (11)-(14). There is a semantic
relation between their two meanings in the sense that the noun refers to a U argument

an NP) or predicatively (as the head of a VP). The same categorial ambiguity is found
also by lexical items that are borrowed from Malay, as illustrated in (15). The two uses
of sakola display the location-activity relationship; tulusa displays the undergoeractivity relationship:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES(15)a. sakola73b. tulusa‘school/school, teach’‘writing/write’As exemplified above, ambiguous items are identified as either noun or verb by
the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.13.2.3Distributional propertiesAt the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):
(16)ne-feela‘my friend’1SG.AL-friendhe-maama‘his father’3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)
below. As illustrated in (17), the bound roots –táng ‘hand’ and wei ‘ear’ combine with
pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.

combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction
1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)
Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuan
languages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.","[94, 95, 96]"
