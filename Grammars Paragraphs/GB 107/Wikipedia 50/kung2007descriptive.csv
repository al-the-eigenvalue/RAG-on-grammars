"582[T0054: 015]The temporal adverbial clitic +ka7 (JST) may occur on either jaantu or
tuu, producing the translation ‘not yet’ in English and ‘todavía no’ in Spanish, as
seen in the examples in (800).

combined with tu7u7 ‘something’ forms the translational equivalent of ‘nothing’.
Evidence that these negative polarity items are not fused lexemes in seen in
(802b), where the temporal clitic occurs on the end of jaantu.

A tag question may be formed in one of three ways: (i) using the tag
particle ta7as, (ii) using the tag clitic +7as, or (iii) using the negative particle
jaantu. The full form of the tag question ta7as occurs only clause-finally, as seen
below in the examples in (785), and it adds a tag question onto the end of the
clause.

‘But, yes, it sounded good, didn’t it?’575[T0066: 195-6]Though the tag question clitic +7as is a reduced form of the full tag ta7as,
its distribution is different. Whereas ta7as occurs only clause-finally, +7as
cliticizes onto the end of verbs (786), adverbs (787), and the negative particle
jaantu (788) regardless of their positions within the clause. When the tag question
cliticizes onto a verb or adverb, it may be translated as a tag question, e.g., ‘didn’t
it?’, ‘doesn’t it?’, or as ‘right?’ in English and ‘¿verdad?’ in Spanish. When +7as
cliticizes onto the negative particle, the result is a negative question, ‘didn’t +
clause’. Neither variant (ta7as or +7as) is used more frequently than the other,
and the choice of which to use seems to lie with the speaker.

first-hand knowledge of the information conveyed by the utterance.
The reportative particle is ubiquitous in narratives and in conversation.
Though maa most frequently occurs in the slot immediately preceding a verb (the
adverbial slot), it may occur anywhere in a clause or even in a phrase. In the
example in (621a) maa precedes a verb phrase. The example in (621b) has two
occurrences of maa in the same clause: the first one precedes a pronoun and the
second one preceds a noun. The example in (621c) also has two occurrences of
maa in the same clause: the first instance of maa precedes a prepositional phrase,
and the second instance precedes the adverbial particle naa, which modifies the
plural adjective lajqay ‘big (ones)’.

6.4.2.2 Epistemic ‘Believe’ kaa
The use of the epistemic particle kaa indicates that the statement
expressed by a clause is the opinion of the speaker, e.g, ‘I believe’ or ‘in my
opinion’. It is only used in the first person context and never in the second or third
person contexts. Kaa occurs quite commonly in both Tlachichilco Tepehua and
Pisaflores Tepehua; in both varieties it means ‘probably’ (Jim Watters, p.c.)
The epistemic particle kaa is not as ubiquitous as the evidential reported
speech particle maa; in fact, it occurs in fewer than one-eighth of the clauses in
the text database (whereas maa occurs in more than half of the clauses). Like
maa, kaa occurs most frequently before verbs, though it may occur anywhere in
the clause. Examples are shown below in (625). In (625a), kaa occurs before the
454negative marker jaantu, which has scope over the verb; in (625b), kaa precedes
the predicate nominal phrase waa maqtilich; in (625c) it occurs before the
predicate pronominal yuuch, which is the head of the following relative clause;
and in (625d) and (625e), kaa precedes the adverbs 7aqtz’iyanch and 7ani7,
respectively.

[QMMES]4566.4.3 Temporal Adverbial Clitics
There are two temporal adverbial clitics in HT: +ch (ALD) ‘already’ and
+ka7 (JST) ‘just’. I analyze these two morphemes as clitics rather than affixes
following criteria offered by Zwicky and Pullum (1983). First, these two clitics
“exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their hosts” (p. 503); they may
affix to nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and negative particles. These clitics are
affixed to words only after all morphosyntactic (derivational and inflectional)
operations have applied. And unlike inflectional and derivational affixes, these
clitics do not have a morphophonemic effect on the words to which they cliticize.
The clitic +ch (ALD) ‘already’ is discussed below in section 6.4.3.1, and +ka7
(JST) ‘just’ is discussed in section 6.4.3.2.
6.4.3.1 ‘Already’ +ch
The temporal adverbial clitic +ch (ALD) is used more frequently than any
other clitic or affix in the language, occurring in approximately one-third of the
clauses in the text database. It may cliticize onto verbs in any aspect, as well as
onto adverbs, nouns, predicative adjectives, demonstrative pronouns, and the
negative particle. However, its meaning is not transparent. Though I have labeled
it (ALD) for ‘already’, it adds this temporal meaning to a verb only in the perfect
aspect, as seen below in the examples in (628).

‘Juan did not play the guitar.’[QMMES]The modality of desire, when there is no change in subject, is expressed by
means of the desiderative suffix (see Section 3.2.3.6) and the realis mood.
Similarly, negative desire also falls under the realm of the realis mood. Examples
are shown in (293).

and Trechsel 2005b) and an analysis of symmetrical (double) objects (MacKay
and Trechsel, to appear b). The same duo focused their attention on the Totonacan
language family at large in their analysis of the Totonacan reciprocal marker laa(MacKay and Trechsel 2003) and in symmetrical object-marking in Totonacan
(MacKay and Trechsel 2005a, 2006).
Finally, Teresa McFarland is writing a detailed overview of the phonology
and morphology of Filomeno Mata Totonac for her Ph.D. dissertation at the
University of California at Berkeley (in progress). She has analyzed the
inflectional system (2005) and the templatic morphology of ideophones (2006, to
appear).
1.5 OVERVIEW OF THE GRAMMAR
Chapter 2: Phonology presents the Huehuetla Tepehua phonemes and
their allophones, the practical orthography that I use to represent HT in all
subsequent chapters, a phonemic merger that is currently taking place in the
language, the syllable structure, rules for primary and secondary stress
assignment, general phonological processes that occur in the language, and
morphophonemic processes that affect the boundaries of particular morphemes.
I have put everything having to do with verbs into Chapter 3: Verbs and
Verbal Morphology. This chapter covers verbal inflectional morphology
(includingperson-markingandtense/aspect/mood),verbalderivationalmorphology (including valence-changing affixes, verb-compounding, and
apectual derivational affixes), existential verbs, positional and postural verbs, the
27copula, periphrastic verbal constructions such as the auxiliary-like verb laa ‘can’
and infinitival phrases that are used to convey the periphrastic future and the
progressive and inchoative aspects.
Similarly, I have put everything to do with nouns into Chapter 4: Nouns
and Nominal Morphology. Not only does this chapter include nominal inflectional
morphology (pluralization and possession) and derivational morphology (deriving
nouns from nouns and nouns from verbs), it also includes syntactic information
relevant to the noun phrase, relational noun constructions, and pronouns.
Chapter 5: Modifiers is quite small. It includes discussion of the HT
quantifiers and adjectives. The adjective section is subdivided further into
adjectival inflection and adjectival derivation.
Chapter 6: Adverbs includes quantifiers used adverbially, prepositions,
and adverbs. Sub-topics under adverbs include temporal, locative, and manner
adverbs, adverbial particles, and adverbial clitics. Manner adverbs can be further
divided into ideophonic and non-ideophonic manner adverbs. Finally, this chapter
includes discussion of the derivational prefix lhii-, which creates a directional
adverb from an adverb or adjective.
Numbers and numeral affixes are discussed in Chapter 7: Numbers.
Subtopics in this chapter include cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, numeral
classifiers, numeral inflection, and the counting of days.
Syntactic analysis of HT is found in Chapter 8: Syntax. Topics discussed
in this chapter include word order of major constituents, focus, interrogation,
negation, comparative and superlative constructions, and complex clauses. The28complex clauses are divided into coordination and subordination, the latter of
which is further divided into relative clauses, complement clauses, adverbial
clauses, and conditional clauses.
Finally, the grammar concludes with an appendix that consists of six fully
interlinearized and analyzed HT narrative texts.
Though I have tried to include as much information about Huehuetla
Tepehua as possible in this grammar, there will always be more that could be
added. However, the most obvious omission from this grammar is an analysis of
HT discourse. Because of time constraints, I have chosen not to include a chapter
dedicated to discourse. However, if one reads the other chapters closely, s/he will
find bits of information about the discourse dispersed throughout the grammar.","[51, 52, 53, 54]"

‘I think that Juan can not play the guitar.’[QMMES]Irrealis Mood
In all modalities but one, the irrealis mood is morphologically marked by
the prefix ka- or its allomorph 7a-. According to Watters (1988), in Huehuetla
245Tepehua, the irrealis prefix ka- is used when the subject is third person or first
person plural inclusive, and the allomorph 7a- is used when the subject is first
person singular, first person plural exclusive, and second person (p. 273). I, too,
found that the allomorph 7a- can be used when the subject is first person singular,
first person plural exclusive, or second person; however it is frequently the case
that no irrealis prefix at all occurs with these persons. My consultant, don Nicolás,
told me that it is more correct to include the 7a- prefix, but that it is usually
omitted in fast speech. In fact, I found that it almost never occurs in naturally
occurring speech, but that it is always accepted when presented during elicitation.
Irrealis modalities include the future tense (both positive and negative) and
obligation, imperative and hortative commands, permission, the optative (wishes),
the conditional, and the dubitative (doubt or uncertainty on the part of the
speaker). The irrealis prefix does not occur on the verb when any of these
modalities occur in the past; the past tense prefix x- occurs on the verb instead.
The irrealis mood maker ka- combines with the future suffix –ya7 (~ -a7)
to form the future tense (see the subsection on Future Tense in Section 3.1.2.1).
Though the future tense is not necessarily a modality, obligation is, and it happens
that the future tense and obligatory mood are the same in HT. Positive examples
are shown in (296).

requires the irrealis prefix ka- and the negative future prefix, ti-. Examples are
shown in (297).

247[QMMES]The imperative, hortative, permissive, optative, conditional, potential, and
dubitative modalities are all morphologically marked in the same way: they are
prefixed with the irrealis marker ka- and suffixed with the perfective aspect
marker –lh. If they occur in the past tense, the irrealis prefix is replaced by the
past tense prefix x-. Even though there is no grammatical difference in these
modalities, there is a slight semantic difference. Examples of each modality
follow.
As stated above, the imperative mood is formed by the combination of the
irrealis prefix and the perfective suffix. The irrealis prefix occurs as 7a- in the
imperative (i.e., a second person command). The prefix is omitted frequently in
regular speech, though (i) forms that bear the prefix are always accepted during
elicitation, and (ii) these irrealis forms are considered to be more correct.
Examples of second person singular commands are shown in (298), and examples
of second person plural commands are shown in (299). Note that any stops or
affricates in the stem are glottalized.

second person plural commands, as seen in the following examples.

indicated by deletion of the stem-final nasal. Given the fact that the prefix kaoccurs on the verb, this is an example of the first person inclusive since the irrealis
allomorph 7a- occurs with first person prefix k- [ak-] to form the exclusive.","[270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"
"AcknowledgementsMy first and largest debt of gratitude goes to all of the speakers of
Huehuetla Tepehua who contributed in some way to this grammar. Without them,
this volume would not exist. I want to thank the Vigueras family, in particular, for
taking me into their home and making me a part of their family: don Nicolás, his
wife doña Fidela, their children Nico, Tonio, Mari, Carmelo, Martín, Lupe, and
Laurencio, and their daughter-in-law Isela. Not only do I have a home here in the
U.S., but I also have a home in Huehuetla with them. There was also the extended
family, who lived in the same courtyard area and who also took me in and gave
me free access to their homes and their lives: don Nicolás’ mother doña Angela,
his two brothers don Laurencio and don Miguel, their wives doña Fidela and doña
Juana, and all of their children.
My deepest and most heart-felt thanks are for my husband, Jon, and our
son, Shaun. Without their love, support, patience, and endless sacrifices, I never
would have been able to finish this grammar. I also want to thank my mom and
dad, who never failed to express their pride, and my father-in-law, a Ph.D.
himself, who continually encouraged my progress.vI have so many additional people to thank that I’m going to thank them in
chronological order, from the start of my graduate career. My fellow cohort
members: Carrie Clarady, Lynda Olman Walsh, David Quinto-Pozos, and Kim
Mellon Kight, for sharing both the good and the bad during the early years; I
wouldn’t have made it to candidacy without their friendship. Heidi Johnson, for
being a mentor to me every step of the way. Terry Kaufman and John Justeson,
for hiring me to work on the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of
Mesoamerica; they are responsible for my decision to work on Huehuetla
Tepehua and not on some other language. Mark Ferguson, for knowing the
location of the appendix in the human body, for insisting that I see a doctor, and
for, essentially, saving my life. Terry Kaufman (again), for teaching me how to do
lexical field work the “right way” and Roberto Zavala, for teaching me to do it the
fun way. Tony Woodbury, for serving as the principle investigator on my NSF
Dissertation Improvement grant, and for providing invaluable advice and support
while I was applying for fellowships. Thomas Smith Stark at the Colegio de
México and Roberto Herrerra Herrerra, formerly of the Universidad de las
Américas – Puebla, for serving as co-sponsors for my Fulbright-García Robles
fellowship. Roberto Herrerra Herrerra (again) and Mandy Holzrichter, for easing
my culture shock during my time in Cholula. Thom Smith Stark (again), his wife
María, my fellow Fulbrighter Jennifer Jolly, and her husband Chris Gonzales, for
providing me with two homes in Mexico City away from the field where I could
go to decompress (and speak English!). Dottie Herzog, for sharing her
unpublished Tepehua dictionary, as well as other unpublished data that she hadvicompiled on the language, and also for sharing her workspace in Huehuetla while
mine was being built. Mark Sicolli, for being there in Catemaco. Christina Willis
and Lynda de Jong Boudreault, for being two of the best friends that I’ve had
during this long gradual process, and for being my only two friends who could
really, fully understood the journey. Suzanne Johnson, for showing me that there
was more to life than just graduate school and linguistics (with or without the kids
in tow).
My fieldwork was funded by the following sources, and I thank them all:
Fulbright IIE (Fulbright-García Robles Fellowship for scholars), the National
Science Foundation (NSF Grant No. 0078453 with Anthony C. Woodbury, PI),
the Pan American Round Tables of Texas (Melba Brunno Dawson Scholarship),
and the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of Mesoamerica.
Most importantly, I want to thank my committee: Nora England, Carlota
Smith, Megan Crowhurst, Tony Woodbury, Jim Watters, and Paulette Levy for all
of their helpful comments, advice, encouragement, and words of praise (those
kept me going more than anything!), not to mention their time, especially since
this grammar turned out to be a lot longer than I had anticipated. My biggest
thanks go to Nora, who has been the best supervisor and mentor that I could have
hoped for! Most importantly, she insisted that this grammar be a thorough
treatment of the language since it might be the only treatment that Huehuetla
Tepehua will ever get.viiA Descriptive Grammar of Huehuetla Tepehua
Publication No._____________Susan Smythe Kung, Ph.D.
The University of Texas at Austin, 2007Supervisor: Nora C. EnglandThis dissertation is a comprehensive description of the grammar of
Huehuetla Tepehua (HT), which is a member of the Totonacan language family.
HT is spoken by fewer than 1500 people in and around the town of Huehuetla,
Hidalgo, in the Eastern Sierra Madre mountains of the Central Gulf Coast region
of Mexico. This grammar begins with an introduction to the language, its
language family, and its setting, as well as a brief history of my contact with the
language. The grammar continues with a description of the phonology of HT,
followed by morphosyntactic and syntactic description of all of the major parts of
speech, including verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and numbers; the grammar
concludes with a description of the sentence-level syntax. A compilation of
interlinearized texts appears in the appendix.
HT is a polysynthetic, head-marking language with complex verbal
morphology. Inflectional affixes include both prefixes and suffixes for which aviiitemplatic pattern is difficult to model. In addition to inflectional and derivational
morphology, HT verbs are also host to a large number of aspectual derivational
morphemes, each of which alters the meaning of the verb in a very specific way.
Plural marking on both nouns and verbs for any third person argument is optional
and determined by an animacy hierarchy, which is also used to determine verbal
argument marking in various morphosyntactic constructions. HT nouns are
completely unmarked for case, and certain nouns, including kinship terms and
parts of a whole, are obligatorily possessed. The order of the major constituents is
pragmatically determined, with a tendency towards VSO order in the absence of
pragmatic or contextual clues and SVO order in context-rich textual examples.
HT is an under-documented moribund language that is at imminent risk of
extinction within the next two-to-three generations. Thus, this dissertation is a
major contribution not only to the field of linguistics, but also to the Tepehua
people who might one day be interested in the language of their grandparents.ixTable of Contents

1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGE
Tepehua is an under-documented, moribund, indigenous language that is
spoken in the Mexican towns of Huehuetla, Hidalgo and Mecapalapa Puebla.
Tepehua belongs to the Totonacan language family, which has two branches:
Tepehua and Totonac.1 The Totonacan languages are spoken in the Eastern Sierra
Madre mountain chain in the Central Gulf Coast region of Mexico where the
contiguous states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Puebla fit together like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle. Illustration 1 is a map the geographical location of the Totonacan
language family within Mexico.
Illustration 1: Map of Totonacan Languages within Mexico1 Two versions of the Totonacan family tree are shown in Figures 1 and 2 in section 1.3.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"561shown below in (761), in which the focus particle occurs clause-finally and not
preceding a focused element. In these examples waa seems to behave more like a
copula than like a focusing element.

[T0063: 038-39]
Further evidence that the HT focus particle is derived from an older form
of the copula is found in third person examples in the irrealis mood. In all irrealis
modalities except the conditional modality and the future tense, the copula is waa
(phonetically identical to the focus particle waa). Examples are shown below in
(762). In these examples, waa is prefixed with the irrealis prefix ka-, and in the
case of (762c), the negative future prefix ti-. However, when the copula is used in
the future tense of the irrealis mood or in the conditional modality, it occurs as the
standard form jun, as seen below in (763).209209 For more information on the irrealis mood, please see Section 3.1.2.3 of Chapter 3.","[586, 587]"
"241show very little cross-linguistic variation in their use of irrealis modality, while
imperatives, futures, questions, and negations show much more cross-linguistic
variation with regard to irrealis mood (p. 376). Whereas counterfactuals and
conditionals cross-linguistically fall into the realm of “nonactualization”,
languages vary with regard to whether or not they treat imperatives, futures,
questions, and negation as actualized or nonactualized (384-6).93 Furthermore,
Palmer (2001) acknowledges that “the idea that notional features of realis and
irrealis are grammaticalized as the typological categories of Realis and Irrealis is a
useful one” (p. 2).
In the following discussion of mood, I draw a mood distinction between
realis and irrealis, and I use the term ‘irrealis’ for three reasons. First, there is only
one particular prefix, ka- and its allomorph 7a-, which is common to all but one of
the contexts in which the “irrealis” mood occurs. Second, all of the contexts in
which this prefix appears are included in both Chafe’s (1995) and Mithun’s
(1995) lists of irrealis contexts, and all of the structures in which it occurs are
contexts which are non-actualized in HT. Third and finally, “irrealis” is the name
used most frequently for the cognate prefix in other Totonacan languages (e.g.,
MacKay 1999; Watters 1988).9493 However, following Givón’s (1994) explication of the irrealis, all of the above mentioned
researchers—Bybee et al (1994), Chafe (1995), and Mithun (1995)—are mistaken in their
association of ‘realis’ with ‘real’ and ‘irrealis’ with ‘unreal’. He writes, “One unfortunate legacy
of the logic-bound approach to modality is the definition of the contrast between realis and irrealis
as a contrast between, respectively, ‘real’ and ‘unreal events” (p. 268-9). For Givón, the difference
between realis and irrealis is a cognitive difference in “subjective certainty” and a communicative
difference in “socially-negotiated meaning” (p. 269).
94 I should note that the grandfather of Totonacan linguistics, Norman McQuown, did not actually
give this prefix a name in his grammar of Coatepec Totonac (1990: 156).","[266, 267]"

This chapter discusses the syntax of Huehuetla Tepehua, including the
following topics: the word order of the major clausal constituents (section 8.1),
focus (section 8.2), interrogation or question formation (section 8.3), negation
(section 8.4), comparative and superlative constructions (section 8.5), and
complex clauses (section 8.6).
8.1 WORD ORDER OF MAJOR CLAUSAL CONSTITUENTS
In this section, I examine the word order of the major clausal
constituents—subject, object, and verb—in HT. The order of the words in specific
types of phrase are discussed in the relevant chapters on verbs, nouns, modifiers,
adverbs, and numbers—chapters 3 through 7, respectively (e.g., the word order
within a noun phrase is discussed in Chapter 4: Nouns and Nominal Morphology).
While in the field, I found that during elicitation, the word order of my
probe clause—be it in Spanish or Tepehua—would influence the word order of
the HT clause of my consultant’s response. Thus, when I elicited the example
shown in (733a) with SVO word order, my consultant gave me an HT clause with
SVO word order. When I then tested all six possible word orders, my consultant

"242Realis Mood
The realis mood is morphologically unmarked; it is distinguished from the
irrealis mood by the absence of the irrealis prefix. The realis mood includes such
modalities as the indicative (factual, specific, or habitual action), desire (without a
change in subject), ability, and strong possibility or belief. The realis mood cooccurs with present and past tenses, as well as imperfective, perfective, and
perfect aspects. Not all realis events are actualized events: for example, negation
of the realis modalities mentioned above is also part of the realis mood in HT;
examples are shown below.
The indicative examples in (291) show the realis mood occurring with the
present imperfective in (a), the past imperfective in (b), and the perfective aspect
in (c).

[BeQ2]8.3 INTERROGATIVE STRUCTURES
All questions in HT are characterized by rising intonation. In addition,
there are various interrogative pronouns and tags that are used in the formulation
of questions.
8.3.1 Yes/No Questions
A yes/no question in HT is always formed using rising intonation.
Additionally, there is an interrogative pronoun jaa that occurs in the focus
position at the beginning of a clause, as seen below in the examples in (764) and
(765). The example in (764a) shows a declarative clause, and the example in
(764b) shows the corresponding interrogative version of the same clause.

[T0020: 034-035]
In (809a), papaanin ‘men’ is the head of the relative clause; it is the noun
that is being modified by the relative clause. The head is co-indexical with the
non-overt subject of the dependent verb, ‘live’, and this grammatical relationship
is marked on the dependent verb by the third person plural subject prefix ta-. The
relativizer juu introduces the relative clause.
In (809b), there are actually two relative clauses—juu 7uputulhch
‘whoever wanted to eat it’ and juu jaantuch ‘whoever did not’—neither of which
modifies a head noun or noun phrase; instead the relative clause juu 7uputulhch
‘whoever wanted to eat it’ acts as the subject argument of the matrix verb 7ulhch
‘ate it’ and the relative clause juu jaantuch ‘whoever did not’ acts as the subject
of the elided verb of the negative verb phrase jaantuch ‘did not’. There are no590distinct relative pronouns in HT, and the relativizer juu introduces both relative
clauses.217
The Relativization Hierarchy in (810) shows the hierarchy of grammatical
roles (in a subordinate clause) that may be relativized in the world’s languages.218
All languages that have relative clauses allow relativization of the subordinate
subject. Different languages allow different grammatical roles to be relativized.
The grammatical roles in this hierarchy are ordered such that if a languages
allows relativization of a particular role, it will also allow relativization of all of
the roles to the left of it on the hierarchy. For example, if the possessor in a
subordinate clause (in a particular language) may be relativized, then all
grammatical roles to the left of the possessor on the hierarchy may also be
relativized in that language.
(810) Relativization Hierarchy
subject > direct object > indirect object > oblique > possessor
POSTNOMINAL
HEADLESSIn HT, the two types of relative clause (the post-nominal and the headless)
behave differently with respect to which grammatical role within the relative (i.e.,
subordinate) clause may be relativized. In the HT post-nominal relative clause, an
oblique argument—and all argument types to the left of it on the hierarchy—may
be relativized as a post-nominal relative clause. Of all of the post-nominal relative
217 The headless relative clause is a subtype of both relative clauses and complement clauses. Formore information on complement clauses, please see the next section.

[T0069: 310]According to Watters (1988), hun (which is imperfective) means
‘become’, while huniita (which is perfect aspect) means ‘be’ (p. 57). Because the
majority of the copular examples in my database are in the perfect aspect and
clearly mean ‘be’, as seen in the examples above in (409) through (411), I had to
elicite examples of ‘become’ (using the Spanish se hizo ‘he became X’ and se
hicieron ‘they became X’). This task successfully produced examples that were
not in the perfect aspect and that mean ‘become,’ as seen in the examples in
(413). The example in (413a) is in the perfective aspect, while the example in
(413b) is in the past tense imperfective aspect. The aspectual contranst mirrors the
chronological contrast: the process of becoming old is a long-term, on-going
process, so it occurs in the imperfective aspect, while the process of becoming a
mother is much more abrupt and less transitional.

There are essentially two grammatical mood distinctions in HT, the realis
mood and the irrealis mood. The realis mood is formally and functionally
unmarked. The irrealis mood is indicated by the prefix ka- and its one allomorph
7a-.92 Different modalities (such as the imperative or the conditional) are
accomplished by combining the irrealis prefix with different tense and/or
aspectual markers.
Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca (1994) argue that the realis/irrealis
distinction “is not cross-linguistically valid” (p. 238); however Chafe (1995) and
Mithun (1995) have both taken the position that the distinction between realis and
irrealis is arguably valid, and that the term ‘irrealis’ is descriptively useful. Even
though the application of the term ‘irrealis’ varies from language to language (or
author to author), nevertheless, there are certain constructions which tend to get
labeled irrealis over and over again. Chafe lists the following contexts in which a
language might employ the irrealis mood: yes-no questions, negations, futures,
necessities (or obligations), possibilities, imperatives, prohibitions, and conditions
(p. 350, 362). According to Mithun, counterfactual and conditional structures

[T0069: 389]Though a classified quantifier may stand alone as an anaphoric expression
that refers to some previously mentioned noun, there is no conclusive evidence
that an unclassified quantifier may do so. I have found only one clause that

‘The fish (PL) stunk.’[TPWDB]HT split intransitivity can be modeled using the animacy hierarchy that
was introduced in example (244) of Section 3.1.1.5 and that is repeated below in
(260). First and second persons are equal to each other, and they outrank third
person animate arguments, which in turn outrank third person inanimate
arguments. With respect to split intransitivity, the pivot point occurs between
third person animate and inanimate; first, second, and third plural animate
subjects are co-indexed on the verb by nominative morphology, while third
person plural inanimates are co-indexed on the verb by the “accusative” prefix
lak-.
(260) HT Animacy Hierarchy and Split Intransitivity
1st & 2nd person >> 3rd person plural animate >> 3rd person plural inanimate
>>
Above I called this pattern an “emerging” one because I believe that this is
relatively new pattern in HT for various reasons. First, no other documented
Totonacan language exhibits patterns of syntactic or morphosyntactic split
217alignment or split intransitivity; instead they are all documented as being strictly
accusative in their syntax and morphology.
Second, the pattern of split intransitivity in Huehuetla Tepehua is an
elusive one because inanimate nominals are not obligatorily marked for plurality
nor are inanimate arguments obligatorily co-indexed on the verb. Furthermore,
though the pattern manifested itself in utterances that were spontaneously
produced by my consultants, it did not always emerge from—or withstand the test
of—elicited grammaticality judgments. I first found the split-intransitive pattern
in sentences that were spontaneously produced by my consultants; when I tried to
test the pattern during elicited grammaticality judgments, I found that in most
cases, both patterns (a strictly accusative one and a split one) were acceptable. For
example, my consultant had given me the example in (261a), in which the
intransitive verb is marked with lak-. Later, I offered the example in (261b), in
which the same verb is marked with ta-, and the example in (261c), in which the
verb is marked with both ta- and lak-. My consultant accepted both examples, and
he told me that all three have the same meaning.

consultant produced the example in (262b), with the same verb again marked with
lak-. When I tested the sentence in (262c), in which the same verb is marked with
ta-, he rejected it. Of course, this set of examples raises the question of why the
examples in (261b) and (261c) are grammatical while the example in (262c) is
not. And, if I asked the same set of questions of the same consultant on a different
day, would the answers still remain the same? These are questions for which I
currently do not have answers.

polysemous morphemes may give rise to grammatical change in a language (e.g.,
Heine, Claudi, and Hünnemeyer 1991; Hopper and Traugott 2003). The prefix
219lak- exhibits more polysemy than any other morpheme in Huehuetla Tepehua: this
prefix is used (i) to indicate multiple plurality of the subject of an intransitive
verb, as seen above in section 3.1.1.2, (ii) to indicate distributive action of a verb,
also seen in section 3.1.1.2, (iii) to co-index a third person plural object, as seen in
section 3.1.1.4, (iv) to mark plurality on inanimate and animate nouns (see
Chapter 4), and (v) to marked plurality on adjectives (see Chapter 5).
Fourth, the use of the prefix lak- as a verbal plural marker overlaps with
the use of 7a- as a verbal plural marker. There is evidence from Watters 1988 that
in Huehuetla Tepehua, the prefix 7a- was the default prefix to co-index a third
person plural object and that the prefix lak- sometimes co-occurred with 7a- and
sometimes did not. In my own data, the reverse is true in that (i) lak- co-indexes a
plural third person object, (ii) 7a- co-indexes an understood plural object on a
detransitivized verb and an indirect object, (iii) the two co-occur to co-index a
plural third person indirect object and/or a plural third person direct object if it
outranks the subject in animacy, and (iv) the two frequently co-occur without any
overt change in the meaning. Next, the use of lak- as a marker of distributivity
overlaps with the meanings of two HT suffixes: -pala, which marks repetitive
action of the verb (see Section 3.2.3.7) and –qoju, which indicates that the action
of the verb is distributed equally over all members of either the subject or object
argument, depending on the transitivity of the verb (see Section 3.2.3.9).
Finally, HT is a moribund language. The children are not learning it, their
parents do not use it, and their grandparents address them in Spanish and speak
Tepehua only amongst themselves. Once a language falls into disuse, the rate of220grammatical and phonological change escalates. I believe that this is what is
happening in HT. Given the polysemy of the morpheme lak-, plus the fact that HT
has other morphemes that provide similar (or the same) meanings as lak-, it is
quite possible that HT is undergoing a grammatical change that might result in an
unquestionable split in its alignment system.

The nominative person marking affixes are summarized in Table 13, and
the accusative affixes are summarized in Table 14. Note that several of the affixes
have one meaning when used for nominative inflection and a slightly different
meaning when used as accusative inflection; these affixes are shown in bold in the
tables.

imperfective aspect, it means ‘still’, as seen below in (642b).","[490, 491, 492]"
"23In addition to verbs and nouns, HT also has a separate class of both
adjectives and adverbs, some of which are full words, but others of which are
particles.
HT is interesting from a phonological perspective for at least two reasons.
There is a word-final process of devoicing that affects not only vowels, but also
the liquid /l/, which is prohibited from occurring in coda position. When
morphophonological processes occur that would force /l/ into a coda position, it
neutralizes with the voiceless lateral fricative phoneme //. Next, a second person
subject is marked on the verb through the laryngealization of stops and affricates;
in some cases, a second person subject is doubly marked by laryngealization as
well as suffixation.
1.4 REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
MacKay (1999) provides a thorough review of all of the linguistic
literature on Totonac and Tepehua spanning from the colonial vocabularies and
grammars of Olmos (1547) and Zambrano Bonilla (1752) and ending with her
own work from the 1990s. Because her review is so thorough, I refer the reader
to that source for reference to anything written before 1997 about Totonac,
Tepehua, or the Totonacan language family. This review of the literature picks up
where MacKay’s left off.
In fact, since the publication of MacKay’s (1999) grammar of Misantla
Totonac, we seem to have entered the golden age of Totonacan research,
especially with respect to the Tepehua branch of the family. Just two decades ago,
the only member of the Tepehua branch to have been documented was the
24Tlachichilco variety (Watters 1980, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1994, 1996a, 1996b). The
only published materials on Huehuetla Tepehua were a 1976 translation of the
New Testament by the Liga Bíblica Mundial de Hogar, several short stories
written by SIL consultants and published by the SIL, Kryder’s (1987) Masters
thesis, which is a sketch of the HT phonology and morphology, and three short
linguistics articles by SIL linguists that either describe or analyze HT numerals
(Bower 1948), HT sentences (Bower and Erickson 1967), and HT verbal
inflection (Herzog 1974).
My own work on HT includes acoustic analysis of uvular stops, glottal
stops, and vowels (Smythe 2000, 2002), reconstruction of uvular stops (Smythe
2003), description and analysis of “affectionate speech”, sound symbolism, and
ideophones in HT (Smythe 2003; Smythe Kung 2005a, 2005c), external
possession or possessor ascension (Smythe Kung 2004), Spanish loanwords
(Smythe Kung 2005b), numeral classifiers (Smythe Kung 2006a, 2007), and split
intransitivity (Smythe Kung 2006b).
Pisaflores Tepehua was a completely undocumented language two decades
ago, but today the work on this language includes not only Hernández Sierra’s
(1986) ENAH thesis on the history of the Tepehua people of Pisaflores and the
phonemes of the language, but also several SIL-published stories in the language
that are available on-line through the SIL and Ethnologue websites, as well as two
forthcoming linguistic descriptions of the language: a grammatical sketch
(MacKay and Trechsler, to appear c) and a phonological sketch (MacKay and
Trechsel, to appear a).","[48, 49, 50]"

HT displays a lexical evidential and epistemic strategy (or information
source) rather a grammatical one (Aikhenvald 2003). The system is comprised of
two particles: the evidential maa (RPT) indicates reported speech (section 6.4.2.1),
while the epistemic kaa (BLV) indicates the speaker’s belief or opinon (section
6.4.2.2). No other source of information is grammatically marked in HT. The two
particles do not co-occur.
6.4.2.1 Evidential ‘Reportative’ maa
The evidential particle maa (RPT) indicates that the speaker does not have
first-hand knowledge of the information. Speakers use maa to recount events that
they did not actually witness or to convey the information that they got from
another source, such as events or stories that they heard from someone else. The
addition of this particle is the equivalent of adding ‘they say’ to a statement in
English or ‘dicen que’ or ‘según’ to a statement in Spanish.180 It is important to
180 The reportative particle maa is also used to coordinate two clauses; please see the section 8.6.2on “Coordination” in Chapter 8 for more information on this use of maa.",[476]
"101Only after I asked the speaker to repeat him- or herself, would he or she include
the first person prefix, and it usually took more than one emphatic repetition
before the [k]+C combination was auditorily perceptible, especially when kpreceded another stop. In the emphatic repetition, don Nicolás and Micaela both
would use the k- prefix, (74a) and (74b), respectively. Don Antonio, on the other
hand, would use 7ik- in such environments, as seen in (74c).

example, the focus particle waa precedes the verb. It is frequently the case that kis syllabified as the coda of this particle, as seen in (71b) above. However, in the

The other two prefixes, the verbal past tense marker x- and the nominal
third person possessor marker x-, are homophones, and they are syllabified in
exactly the same way. Though they do conform to the syllable structure given in
(55), they create consonant clusters such as [fricative] + [fricative] or [fricative] +

that the first person subject prefix k- is: either as the coda of a preceding word or
particle, as seen in the examples in (76), or as the coda of an epenthetic [], as
seen in the examples in (77). However, unlike the k- prefix, these two prefixes are
never omitted.46

HT periphrastic verbal constructions consist of a two-verb predicate in
which the two verbs are not compounded together. Two such constructions are
covered here: infinitival phrases (Section 3.4.1) and constructions involving the
generic verb laa- ‘can’, ‘do’ (Section 3.4.2).
3.4.1 Infinitival phrases
Three different constructions utilize the infinitive in HT: the periphrastic
future (Section 3.4.1.1), progressive aspect (Section 3.4.1.2), and inchoative
aspect (Section 3.4.1.3). The morphophonemics of infinitives are covered here,
and the specifics of these three constructions are covered in the following
subsections.
The infinitival suffix –nV7 in HT is affixed to the second verb in a twoverb periphrastic construction. The vowel of the suffix harmonizes with the last
vowel of the verb stem; examples are shown in (434).

mood marking (as seen above in (434a), as well as the subject marking, as seen in
the examples below in (436). Object marking, however, may occur on either verb.
Above in (434c), the first person object marker is prefixed to the first (inflected)
verb in the infinitival phrase, but below in (435), it is the infinitival (second) verb
that is marked for a third person plural object by the plural prefix lak-.

of –nV7 on the infinitival verb. This form appears to be related to the plural
nominal suffix -nin.122 In (436a), the subject is first person singular, and the
infinitive bears the –nV7 allomorph. In (436b), the subject is first person plural,
and the infinitive bears the –nin allomorph. Examples of infinitive constructions
in which the subject is third person plural are shown below in (437).

The adverb class in Huehuetla Tepehua is a catch-all class of words and
particles that (i) modify other words, (ii) may not be inflected, and (iii) do not fall
into any of the other word classes. Adverbs may be loosely divided into three
subclasses: temporal (section 6.1), locative (section 6.2), and manner (section
6.3). Manner adverbs may be further divided into those that are ideophonic or
symbolic in nature (section 6.3.1) and those that are not (section 6.3.2). Other,
more specific adverbs are treated in section 6.4; these include: the emphatic
adverb naa (section 6.4.1), the evidential and the epistemic adverbs (section
6.4.2), temporal adverbial clitics (section 6.4.3), quantifiers used as adverbs
(section 6.4.4). Prepositions are discussed in section 6.6. HT Adverbs form a
distinct word class from nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Unlike the other words
classes, adverbs may not be inflected; they do, however, accept the applicative
derivational prefix lhii-, which may also appear on verbs and nouns (section 6.5).
Finally, adverbs may undergo a phonological process of reduplication that does
not apply to the other word classes; this process is addressed along with the
ideophonic adverbs in section 6.3.1.
6.1 TEMPORAL ADVERBS
Temporal adverbs and temporal adverbial clauses are always clause- or
sentence-level modifiers.177 They usually occur pre-verbally, either at the
beginning of the sentence or immediately before the verb, as seen in the examples
177 Please see Chapter 8, Section 8.6.1.3 for information on the internal structure of adverbialclauses.","[449, 450, 451]"

In HT the aspectual derivational affixes include the inchoative (3.2.3.1),
the imminent (3.2.3.2), the roundtrip (3.2.3.3), the ambulative (3.2.3.4), a second
type of inchoative that I call ‘begin’ (3.2.3.5), the desiderative (3.2.3.6), two types
of repetitive action affixes that I call ‘repetition’ (3.2.3.7) and ‘again’ (3.2.3.8), an
affix that indicates a complete set that I call ‘all’ (3.2.3.9), and the distal and the
proximal (3.2.3.10).
3.2.3.1 Inchoative taThe inchoative prefix ta- indicates that the subject of the clause is entering
into a state or beginning an action. It may occur on both transitive and intransitive
verbs, and it occurs in all tenses, aspects, and moods, as seen in the examples
below in (365).

nii[T0069: 432]According to Watters (1988), in Tlachichilco Tepehua, only stative verbs
(and verbs of destruction) “may serve as the base for the inchoative prefix ta-” (p.
42). Though the majority of textual examples involving the inchoative prefix do
occur on stative verbs in Huehuetla Tepehua as well, this prefix appears on the
non-stative verb in (365b) above. However, according to Watters (p.c.), in
Tlachichilco Tepehua, the root paxay is a stative verb meaning ‘X is different,
changed’. Further semantic testing needs to be done on this HT verb to confirm if
it is or is not a stative.
When the inchoative prefix ta- precedes a body part prefix, as seen below
in the examples in (366b) and (366c), it is acting as a fully productive morpheme.
When it follows a body part prefix, as seen below in the examples in (367), the
inchoative prefix and the verb root form a lexicalized frozen form that is no
longer productive. In (367), tanuu ‘insert’ is a lexicalized stem, whereas tajuu
‘insert’ in (366), is a productive stem composed of ta- and the verb jun ‘to be’,287between which a lexical prefix may intervene. In all of these examples, the
inchoative ta- is in bold type and the BPPs are underlined.

(see Section 3.1.2.3 on Mood), but the two prefixes have very different meanings.
The imminent prefix indicates that the subject argument is about to perform the
action of the verb. This prefix is relatively rare; examples are shown in (369).

somewhere else to perform the action of the verb and returned again. The cognate
prefix in other Totonacan languages has been called the “regressive” (McQuown
1990: 184), the “intentional (MacKay 1999: 327), “return” (Watters 1988: 248),
and “roundtrip” (Beck 2004: 77). As there is no consensus in the literature, I
follow Beck because “roundtrip” is both descriptively accurate and easy to
abbreviate as RT. Given that the notion of going and returning implies completion
of the action, the roundtrip prefix occurs only in the past tense imperfective
aspect, the perfect aspect, and the perfective aspect, as seen in the examples below
in (370).","[310, 311, 312, 313, 314]"

possessed noun, as seen below in (425a), where the copula bears the first person
prefix instead. Presumably the possessive prefix and the first person prefix occupy
the same morphological slot, so a copula is required to bear the person-marking.
However, when the argument is second person, as seen in (425b), the second
person subject suffix does occur on the noun since is does not occupy the same
slot as the possessive prefix.

IRR-be-FUT3.3.3.3 Predicate Adjectives
The predicate adjective construction is almost identical to the predicate
nominal construction with one exception: the copula is not needed in the present
tense when the subject is third person plural, as seen below in (430g). In the
predicate nominal construction, the noun may not bear plural verbal morphology,
which necessitates the presence of the copula in all of the plural person
paradigms. However, given that the plural prefix lak- is the morpheme that is
normally used to co-index plurality on adjectives (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1.2.1),
a copula is not necessary to bear this particular verbal affix. A complete present
tense paradigm is shown below in (430). The singular first and second person
327affixes occur directly on the adjective in (430a) and (430b), respectively. Third
person singular is not marked on the adjective, and no copula is required, as seen
in (430c). In the first and second person plural forms, a copula is required to bear
the person-marking affixes, as seen in (430d), (430e), and (430f). Finally, in
(430g), the plural prefix occurs directly on the adjective, as discussed above.

[T0055: 059]Though most answers to wh-word questions include the focus particle
waa, it is not a requirement of the grammar, as can be seen in the examples below
in (752) and (753). Even though the focus particle does not occur in the clause in
(752b), the adverbial answer to the question does occur in the clause-initial focus
position.","[580, 581]"
"591clauses, those that are relativized on subjects of the subordinate verb occur far
more frequently than those that are relativized on direct objects of the subordinate
verb, which in turn occur more frequently than those that are relativized on
indirect or oblique objects within the relative clause. I have found no instances of
a possessor being relativized in HT. With respect to the headless type of relative
clause, these may be relativized only on subjects of the subordinate verb in HT.
I am not aware of any type of hierarchy that ranks the grammatical roles of
the head of the relative clause (i.e., the argument in the matrix clause that is coindexical with the relativized argument in the subordinate clause). The
determination of such a hierarchy would require cross-linguistic comparison of
many different languages from diverse language families and, thus, is outside the
scope of this analysis of the HT relative clause. Suffice to say that in HT, only the
subject or the object of the matrix clause may be the head of a relative clause.
Examples of different types of post-nominal relative clause appear in the
following examples. These examples are ordered with respect to the grammatical
role of the relativized element (i.e., the grammatical role of the “relativized” zero
element in the matrix clause). Relativized subjects of subordinate verbs are shown
in the examples in (811), relativized objects in (812), relativized indirect objects
in (813), and relativized oblique objects in (814). Further examples of headless
relativized subjects are shown below in (815).
In each of the examples in (811), the non-overt relativized element is the
subject of its relative clause. In the examples in (811a) and (811b), the heads of
the relative clauses, maqtili7 and yuuch, respectively, are the subjects of their592respective matrix clauses, as well as the subject of their relative clauses. In (811c),
the head of the relative clause lapanak ‘person’ is the object of the matrix clause
and the subject of the relative clause. The matrix clause in (811d) is a fragment in
which the speaker cut himself off after the relative clause and began a new clause
with the discourse marker entonces ‘then’; however, since the head of the relative
clause, juu pumatam lapanak ‘one person’, occurs in clause-initial position, it
would most likely have been the grammatical subject of the clause, given the
VSO and SVO word order tendencies in this language.

"16I worked primarily with don Nicolás, and my first task was to teach him to
read and write my HT practical orthography. We spent much of the nine months
that I was there recording narratives and conversations with various community
members, then transcribing them and translating them into Spanish.
In a rural village, the mornings are the busiest time of the day for the
town’s people, who rise early to begin their daily tasks. The men go off to the
fields to work, while the women see their children off to school and hurry to get
some of the never-ending housework done before the children come home again
in the early afternoon. Thus, the mornings were never a good time for me to
search out consultants because no one—except don Nicolás—had time to work
with me.
Thus, don Nicolás and I spent our mornings transcribing and translating
texts. The first step in this process involved transcribing an entire HT text. Next
don Nicolás translated the HT text loosely into Spanish. Finally, we completed a
word-for-word translation together; this allowed me to analyze the words as we
worked and to conduct impromptu grammatical and semantic tests when I
encountered new forms.
In the early afternoons, there was a period of about two hours that fell
after most of the chores were done but before the children came home from
school. During these two hours, the whole town was very peaceful, and the adults
were resting. This was the best time of the day for me to go visiting other people
in the community in search of HT consultants. Thus, most afternoons, don17Nicolás and I would venture out into the town to record texts and word lists with
various community members.
In addition to transcribing and translating texts with don Nicolás, I also
conducted straight lexical and grammatical elicitation with him, often involving
one to three additional HT speakers in the sessions. I organized the grammatical
elicitation sessions based on topics suggested in Payne (1997) and issues that
came up during text transcription and translation.
Even though I worked with 50 different HT-speakers during the course of
my fieldwork, the bulk of the grammatical judgments on which this grammar are
based belong to don Nicolás; thus, this dissertation could be considered to be a
descriptive grammar of his idiolect, to some extent.
I used a Sony MZ-R30 portable mini-disk recorder and a Sony DCRTRV11 Digital Handycam to record digital video onto mini-DVs. I also used a
Marantz PMD222 Portable Cassette Recorder to copy and play back audio data,
and a dictophone transcription machine and foot pedal to transcribe the recorded
discourse. I used the SIL computer program Shoebox 1.0 (the DOS version that
was still used by the PDLMA) to database the collected data and to interlinearize
the texts, and I used Speech Analyzer (version unknown) to make spectrograms in
the field.
In addition to audio-recording narratives, texts, and conversation, I video
recorded the events of several of the town’s major holidays, including Candlemas
(Candelaria) and Mardi Gras (Carnaval). The data from my time in Huehuetla
include 53 transcribed and translated texts that vary in length from one to sixty18minutes and that fill over 800 notebook pages; seven untranscribed narrative
recordings; approximately 700 pages of notes from grammatical and lexical
elicitation sessions; 16 hours of audio recordings; and 12 hours of video
recordings.
In the summer of 2005, I returned to Catemaco to complete my third and
final summer for the PDLMA. This time, because of family obligations at home
in Texas, I spent only five weeks working on the project. Once again, don Nicolás
was my principal consultant. During this time, I finished direct elicitation of the
Bouquiaux Questionnaire. I tested all of the ethnobotanical and ethnozoological
terms in the database, then don Nicolás sorted them all into taxonomies. We went
through Melissa Bowerman’s Topological Picture Series (no date), which
produced positional verbs, relational nouns, and prepositional phrases. I elicited
color terms using a color chart (Hoogshagen and Hoogshagen 1993), and I
elicited smells using those listed in Enríquez (2004) for Papantla Totonac. We
used a large toolbox full of tools typically found in Mexican farming communities
to generate words for all of the various tools. I used the existing ethnozoological
terms in the database to elicit words for animal cries, noises, and movements. We
did not record any texts at all that summer, nor did we do any transcription or
translation. This was the first field summer that I did not work with notebooks. To
save time, I entered most of the data directly into the database, resorting to file
slips only occasionally.
In all I spent 14 months conducting field work on Huehuetla Tepehua. I
have so much data in notebooks, on file slips, on mini-(audio)-disks, on video,19even on random scraps of paper, that I feel like I will never have enough time to
analyze it all. After I returned from the field in 2001, it took me three years to
organize the small portion of the data that I have used to write this grammar.4
Even though I felt compelled to continue adding to the dictionary and
interlinearizing texts, I reached a point when I had to stop organizing and start
analyzing and writing. There are many gaps in the analyzed data presented here,
but I am sure that answers to the questions left by these gaps can be found
somewhere in the volumes that I have collected, if only I knew where to look.
Cecil Brown recently told me that it is only after the Ph.D. is done that the real
work begins. I know that I have my work cut out for me for years to come.
1.3 HUEHUETLA TEPEHUA AND THE TOTONACAN LANGUAGE FAMILY
Huehuetla Tepehua is a member of the Tepehua branch of the Totonacan
language family, which has only two branches, Tepehua and Totonac (see Figures
1 and 2 below). The Totonacan languages are spoken in the Mexican states of
Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo, and the Totonac and Tepehua branches are
mutually unintelligible (MacKay 1999). Because so little documentation exists for
the Totonacan languages, it has not been possible to determine if this language
family is a linguistic isolate or if it is related to Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean, as
suggested by Greenberg (1987) and McQuown (1940, 1942). However, Kaufman
(2003) argued that the lexical cognates that exist between Totonacan and MixeZoquean are the result of contact rather than genetics.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

Though the above examples in (70) are attested forms, the onset consonant
cluster produced by the prefixation of k- (1SUB) to a consonant-initial stem does
not conform to the syllable structure shown above in (55) because the /k/ is
neither a continuant, nor a coronal. Speakers resolve this conflict in one of four
ways: (i) they allow the cluster, as seen in the examples above in (70), which are
exceptions to the coronal edge constraint, (ii) they syllabify the /k/ of the first
99person prefix as the coda of a preceding vowel-final particle or word, (iii) they
insert an epenthetic [i-] before the [k], or (iv) they omit the k- prefix entirely.
Examples of syllabification as a coda of the first person subject prefix kare shown below in (71). In (71a), the /k/ has been syllabified as the coda of the
preceding adverb, and in (71b), the /k/ has been syllabified as the coda of the
preceding particle. Evidence for syllabification of the prefix as a coda is found in
the form of an audible release after the [k] in both forms in (71). In these
examples, the [k] behaves more like a word-final stop (in that it is released) than a
word-initial stop (which is not released). In contrast, the word-initial [k] in the
examples shown in (70) above is not released preceding another consonant in
onset position. This process of syllabifying the k- prefix as the coda of the
preceding word or particle conforms to the syllabification rules shown above in
(68) in that an unsyllabified consonant will be put into coda position before it will
be put into a consonant cluster in onset position.

8.2.2 Focus Particle waa
The HT focus particle waa precedes a pragmatically emphasized element
in a clause without directly influencing the element’s location within the clause. It
serves to highlight or draw attention to a clausal constituent. It most commonly
occurs before a verb, before a predicate nominal or adjective, and before the
answer to a wh-word question. However, it also occurs before other clausal
elements, as will be seen below.
The most obvious place in which one finds a focused element is in the
answer to a wh-word question. The focused constituent of the answer is the part of
the clause or phrase that plays the same grammatical role as the wh-word in the
corresponding question, as seen in the examples below in (748) through (751).207
These answers are actually doubly focused because they are preceded by waa and
they occur in clause-initial focus position. In the question in (748a), one person
asks another where he was. The answer in (748b), lak José Pollo ‘at José Pollo’s207 Please see Section 8.3 of this chapter for more information on interrogative structures.","[576, 577, 578, 579]"

In my own data, HT clauses are frequently coordinated by means of what
appears to be the evidential reportative particle maa.225 Nora England (p.c.)
suggests to me that this instance of maa is actually a conjunction that is similar to
the evidential clitic maa due either to homophony or to some historical change
that is not clear from a synchronic point of view. This could be the case because
when my consultant loosely translated passages that contained the particle maa,
he would translate maa as either y ‘and’ or segun ‘according to’. However, when I
asked for a specific translation of maa, he always translated it as segun. When I
explicitly tried to elicit a conjunction using conjoined clauses or phrases in
Spanish, my consultant would either use the Spanish conjunction y in the HT
clause or he would juxtapose the two clauses or phrases. He never used maa in
elicited examples. For this reason, I continue to gloss maa as the evidential
particle RPT in the examples that appear below in (833) and (834).
Setting aside the question of whether or not the particle maa is or is not
the evidential clitic, examples in which maa is used to coordinate two clauses
with the same subject are shown below in (833), and examples in which it is used
to coordinate two clauses with different subjects are shown below in (834). In all
225 Please Chapter 6, Section 6.4.2.1 for more information on the evidential reportative particlemaa.","[642, 643]"

Perfect aspect in HT corresponds to Smith’s (1997) definition: “Perfect
sentences locate a situation prior to Reference Time.91 They have a stative value,
and they ascribe to the subject a property based on participation in the prior
situation” (p. 186).
The perfect aspect in HT is marked on the verb by the suffix -ta. Examples
are shown below in (288). This suffix has one allomorph -niita, which—
according to Watters (1988)—occurs only with the verb jun ‘be’ and comes from
the Totonac perfect aspect suffix –ni:ta (p. 57, ft. 7).

[QMMES]The dubitative modality differs from the other irrealis modalities in one major
way: it is optionally used based on the speaker’s attitude toward the information
being conveyed, as demonstrated by the examples in (310) and (311). In the
example in (310a), the speaker is not sure if the person in question will come, and
he uses the dubitative modality. In the example in (310b), the speaker is more
confident that the person in question will come, which is reflected by his use of

choice of mood is available to the Tepehua speaker.

[QMMES]3.2 DERIVATION
Derivational operations in HT include operations that change the valency
of the verb stem (Section 3.2.1) and verb compounding (Section 3.2.2).
3.2.1 Valency-Changing Affixes
Valency-changing derivational affixes either decrease or increase the
valency of the verb. Valency-decreasing affixes in HT are the reflexive (3.2.1.1),
and the reciprocal (3.2.1.2). Valency-increasing affixes in HT are the dative
(3.2.1.3), the causative (3.2.1.4), the instrumental (3.2.1.5), the comitative
(3.2.1.6), the applicative (3.2.1.7), and the body part prefixes (3.2.1.8).
2553.2.1.1 Reflexive -kan
The reflexive suffix –kan is homophonous with the indefinite subject
suffix –kan. However, the reflexive suffix decreases the valency of the verb, as
seen below in (312). Both (312a) and (312b) have separate agent and patient
arguments; however, the reflexive suffix –kan in the clause in (312c), indicates
that the agent and the patient arguments have the same referent.

[MNB13: 96]6.5 DERIVED DIRECTIONAL ADVERBS (APPLICATIVE LHII-)
The applicative prefix lhii- may affix to a lexical adverb or adjective, in
addition to nouns and verbs. When prefixed to an adverb or adjective, it derives a
adverb with a directional meaning, as seen in the examples in (649) and (650). In
the examples in (649a) and (649b), lhii- is prefixed onto the lexical locative
adverbs 7ani7 ‘here’ and 7uwiint’i ‘there’, respectively, resulting in derived
adverbs with the meanings ‘around here’ and ‘over there’.

direction of the width’.

[T0069: 098]Finally, the prefixation of lhii- to the third person singular pronoun yuuch
derives the adverb lhiiyuuch ‘therefore’, as seen below in (651). This adverb is
most likely lexicalized.

There are only two prepositions in HT laka-, which expresses locative and
comitative relationships (section 6.6.1), and tuus, which expresses relationships of
extent (section 6.6.2). Other prepositional-like relationships are expressed by
relational nouns in HT.182
6.6.1 Locative/Comitative lakaThe HT prepositional prefix laka- affixes to a head noun and marks
locative and comitative noun phrases; examples appear below in (652). If the head
noun is definite, the definite article juu precedes the preposition. In the following
examples, the prepositional phrase is enclosed in brackets, and the preposition182 Please see Chapter 4, Section 4.4 for more information on the relational nouns.","[494, 495, 496, 497]"

"Given the phonetic similarity between the root spulu ‘crunching’ in
(562d)—which is suffixed with –k’u—and the root lhpupu ‘sparking’ in (562e)—
which is suffixed with –7o, the two variations of this suffix do not seem to be in
complementary distrubution. I did not explicitly test for this morpheme during my
field work, so I do not have enough examples of either of the variants to be able to
determine what conditions their variation. Also, I have a strong sense that many
410of these adjectives are lexicalized because I cannot identify the root in the
majority of the examples that I have. An obvious explanation for the variation
between -k'V and and -7V (*-q’V) is one of a symbolic phonemic variation
between /k/ and /q/ (see Chapter 2, section 2.6.10), given the prevelant use of
symbolic phonemic variation within the language; however, my database does not
contain any instances of both variations being used on the same stem. The same
variation between “allomorphs” of this cognate suffix is found in Papantla
Totonac. While Levy does not offer an explanation for the variation, she has
found contrasting lexical minimal pairs involving the two cognate variants (1992:
276), indicating that in PT, at least, the variants are not allomorphs and that
symbolic phonemic variation alone can not explain the variation.
When the adjectivizer follows the –ni allomorph of the derverbalizer, it
always occurs as –k’a, as seen in the examples in (563).

thickly(ADV)-DVB-ADJZ
‘thick, dense’ (ADJ)[MNB13: 94]The following set of examples shown in (564) are all derived from the
adverb soq ‘straight’, which is shown in (564a). The adjectival form, soqnik’a,
and its derivation are shown in (564b). The example in (564c) shows soqnik’a as411a non-verbal predicate adjective.167 In example (564d), I attempted to use
soqnik’a as an attributive adjective modifying a head noun in a noun phrase; my
consultant found this usage to be grammatically questionable, but he did not reject
it outright. When I tried to inflect soqnik’a with the third person plural subject
marker ta-, my consultant rejected the example, shown in (564e). The example in
(564f) shows that the predicative adjective is pluralized by means of the plural
prefix lak- when the subject of the predicate is plural. The examples in (564g) and
(564h) are interesting because they demonstrate that when the copula is used, the
adverbial form soq is used instead of the adjectival form soqnik’a; this could be
due to a restriction on the part of speech of words that may precede a verb given
that the syntactic position immediately before the verb is normally occupied by an
adverb, an adverbial particle, a noun, or a discourse marker.

[QMMES]Like the past optative, the past conditional is expressed by means of the past tense
plus the perfective aspect. Furthermore, the evidential particle kaa, which I gloss
as BLV or ‘belief’, occurs in all of the examples of past conditional clauses in my
database. Examples are shown in (307).

that was seen above for the imperative, the optative, the conditional, and the
potential modalities: the irrealis prefix and perfective aspect. The use of the
dubitative modality reflects doubt or uncertainty on the part of the speaker about
the veracity of the information. Examples are shown in (309).","[277, 278]"

Coordination in HT is accomplished by means of juxtaposition of clauses
or phrases, with or without a coordinator. The coordinators used in HT include the
reportative particle maa, the complementizer nii, and the borrowed Spanish
coordinators y ‘and’ and pero ‘but’. Examples and discussion follow.
A common way to coordinate clauses in HT is to juxtapose two clauses
without using a coordinator, as seen in the examples below in (828) and (829). In
these examples, each independent clause appears within square brackets. In all of
the examples in (828), the two clauses have the same subject, and this subject is
marked on each matrix verb. However, in the examples in (829), each clause has a
different subject, which is also marked on each matrix verb.
(828) Juxtaposition of 2 clauses with the same subject:

two verbs, shown below in (830). Only the first verb is marked for person. Either
this is a speech error, or it is not necessary to mark the second (or third) verb in a
conjoined verb phrase for person.

translated it as también ‘also’. This example is shown below in (832).","[638, 639, 640, 641, 642]"
