"In combination with the irrealis, the sense of negation can apply to the physical possibility,
not necessarily solely the negation of the future event:
(220)Depu d-ele'-le'
ycmg-ri mi.
1 SG
I SG-gO-<IRR> leg-INSTR NEG
'I'm not up to going on foot. ' OR 'I 'm not going to go by foot. 'Negative existence (,there i s n o _' ) i s expressed with mou:
(22 1 )SU
mou.
sago not.exist
'There's no sago. 'As with the completive, the negative is not a verb-final particle, but a clause-final one.
This can be shown with sentences in which there is a postverbal element, which can intrude
between the verb and the negator (though see §S.2. 1 ).",[100]
"5. 7.2 NegativeNegation is expressed on all clauses, with verbal, adjectival or nominal predicates, with
the negative particle mi, which appears clause-finally. Some examples of use of the negative
are shown below, with verbal and adjectival predicates.
(2 1 6)mi.
k-ei
Pi
rain.M 3SG.M-do NEG
'It won't rain. '(2 1 7)Wasa dina
taka mi.
basket 1 SG.POSS heavy NEG
'My basket isn't heavy.'",[100]
"5. 7. 4 ProhibitiveThe prohibitive particle ni indicates that the clause is a negative command to the hearer.
As with the positive imperative described in §5 .7.3, it appears clause-finally:
(227)Di
m-a
nil
l SG.ACC 2SG-hit PROHIB
'Don't hit me !'",[101]
"The example above is ambiguous, with the additional reading 'Dad didn't [go to the
garden with Mum] ' (and so no-one went). Nevertheless, all speakers who were consulted
agreed that the reading of the sentence given in the translation above is also a normal
interpretation of the scope of the negative.
In an inflected adverbial + light verb 'do' construction, it is the former dependent verb that
is negated, as illustrated in the example below:Syntax(273)93Tra d-asi
d-ei
mi.
sago 1 SG-well 1 SG-do NEG
'I made the sago badly.'
(*1 didn't [make sago (well)].)The topic of scope of negation deserves more detailed treatment than can be presented
here, and it is hoped that further works on I'saka grammar can delve into this topic in more
depth.","[110, 111]"
"With a nominal predicate the same negator is used:
(2 1 8)mi.
dina
A
pig.M 1 SG.POSS NEG
'(That's) not my pig. 'The predicate alone may be mentioned with the negative particle, if the subject of the
clause is retrievable from the discourse. This is true for both verbal and non-verbal
predicates:
(2 1 9)mi.
Dina
1 SG .poss NEG
'(That's) not mine.'",[100]
"6.3 NegationNegation can be marked only once for the clause, and it is always at the end of the clause,
following both the predicate and any oblique nominals that are in clause-final position.
The negative particle, mi, is invariant for person, number, gender or tense/aspect/mood
distinctions:
(270)Di
wii-na
mi.
l SG.ACC 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT NEG
'I 'm not sick. '(27 1 )Bu dina
ml.
that l SG.POSS NEG
'That's not mine.'",[110]
"5.7 Clause-Itnal particlesVarious polarity, aspect and mood distinctions are marked at the end of the clause. In
addition to clauses with none, or just one particle, there are some complications to do withMorphology81clauses that have both clause-level particles finally, and a dative suffix on the verb. These are
discussed in the following sections. The only occurrences of more than one particle on the
same clause that have been observed in natural speech involve one of the following particles
and a dative suffix; sequences of more than one of the particles exemplified in this section
have not been observed.","[98, 99]"
"(225)SU
b-ei
mu!
sago 2SG-do IMP
'Make the sago ! '83The fact that this particle begins with m-, the nasal allomorph of the 2SG subject prefix,
leads one to suspect that it may in fact be (or at least originate from) a dependent verb
inflected for 2SG subject. As imperative clauses are generally pragmatically restricted to
second person in any case, this might be plausible, except for the fact that examples of 2PL
and 2DU subjects also show mu, not *yfng (putatively expected, if the hypothesised ung was
an inflecting verb). It should also be noted that this construction was heard very rarely,
though it was freely accepted when materials were checked. Other, less compelling,
imperatives are formed with no additional morphology:
(226)m-ou!
B-au
2SG-come 2sG-eat
'Come and eat ! 'A sequence of the negative m i (see §6 .3) and the imperative m u i s not grammatical for
negated imperatives, since there is a special prohibitive marker ni.",[101]
"Temporals have scope over the whole clause, providing a time for events relative to the
utterance. Only three distinct temporals have been identified: kelie (or, sometimes, kelia)
'yesterday, before today' , buru 'today, now', and ba la 'tomorrow, later on '. Deictics
similarly exhibit three distinct forms, but the contrast encoded in the different forms is not a
simple one of spatial distance. The proximal and distal deictics are opposed in space, but the
third deictic has a discourse function rather than a spatial function. Three postpositions
(expressing location, accompaniment and instrumental) are also found.
Five clause-final particles have been identified, and it is expected that others also exist.
These cover a range of semantic and grammatical functions. Their domain includes tense/
aspect/mood and negation; they have been grouped together on the basis of their common
position in, and scope over, the clause.
Additionally there are several other particles and word-types that are only rarely found in
our data and are poorly understood. These remain unclassified on semantic or morphological
grounds, though they are listed in §3 .5.",[57]
"Despite the invariant position of the negative marker at the end of the whole clause, the
scope does not necessarily apply over the entire clause. In the following construction, which
contains both an accompaniment and a locative oblique argument following the verb, the
accompaniment argument can be negated without negating the rest of the clause:
(272)Tani ' k-ele '
moni' tro pli
mi.
father 3SG.M-go mother with garden NEG
'Dad went to the garden without Mum.'",[110]

followed. A, S and P have been used descriptively to represent the syntactic roles of most
agentive arguments of a primary transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as it does),
single argument of an intransitive predicate, and most patientive argument of a primary
transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as they do), respectively, following Comrie
( 1 978) and Andrews ( 1 985:6 8). The following additional abbreviations are used in the text

the morpheme line: the hyphen '- ' is used to separate morphemes forming one phonological
,
word, and a space ' is used to mark off separate words. Punctuation marks are used
according to English conventions. The usual star ' *' is used to indicate an ungrammatical
utterance, while a hash '#' is used for one that is either infelicitous for a particular context, or
else acceptable only for some speakers, or one about which speakers vacillate in their
judgements from time to time.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"6.6 Verb serialisationI ndependent verbs may be used in serial verb constructions, provided that they show
identical subject agreement, and the same specifications for polarity, aspect, etc. Serial verb
constructions are common constructions in the languages of New Guinea, and their use in
I'saka can be seen in the following example, which shows both manner-of-motion and simple
change-of-location verbs serialised together, each with their own inflection for subject,
necessarily agreeing (if there is overt agreement - the 3PL subject in (292) evokes no overt
agreement on the verbs because these verbs take no agreement prefix for 3PL).
(29 1 )ya.

'The big pig ran away. '(292)Dakau onde akane w{ysau .
children go hide forest
'The children went and hid in the bush.'",[114]
"The prohibitive may be used with non-volitional predicates:
(229)nil
Mama b-epili
2SG
2sG-afraid PROHIB
'Don't be frightened ! '84Chapter 5With respect to the variability of the position of the completive particle with respect to
dative suffixes, it seems that the prohibitive cannot precede the dative agreement markers:
(230)Mama we m-akane-na
ni.
2SG
fish 2sG-hide- 1 SG.DAT PROHIB
'Don't you hide my fish now ! '(23 1 )B-ai-na
ni.
2sG-take- 1 SG.DAT PROHIB
'Don't take mine ! '(23 1 ),*b-ai-ni-naThe use of this particle may also occasionally be found in statements, not only in
commands. Thus, clauses with second person subjects are sometimes negated with ni PROHIB
rather than mi NEG, regardless of whether or not the speaker is actually commanding the
listener. An example of this can be seen in the following sentence, which cannot, because of
the time expression, be construed as being an imperative.
(23 2)Kelie
b-ele ' i'
ni.
yesterday 2sG-go village PROHIB
'You didn't go to the village yesterday. 'Note that the lack of a recognisable 2SG inflection on the ni particle makes it less
convincing that the general imperative (§5 .7.3) is in fact inflected for this person, but is in
fact simple coincidence: the chance of a random consonant occurring to match the b- of the
2SG is high in a language with only eight consonants.","[101, 102]"
"1.3. 1 Language useOf the three languages found in Krisa village, Tok Pisin is the most commonly used, for
people of all ages and social positions. I'saka is not for most people the normal medium of
communication, although people nearly always seem to enjoy discussing and teaching the
language. English is spoken by few villagers whose schooling and position in the village
government requires it, and it is used only with the occasional non-Tok Pis in speaking
outsider.
I 'saka is no longer being widely learnt as a first language, although the extent of this
decline, as opposed to diglossia, is difficult to ascertain, as it seems that children's passive
knowledge of the language greatly exceeds their active capabilities. It is possible that people
do not really start to speak I'saka themselves until they reach adulthood, a pattern of local
language usage that has been reported elsewhere on the north-west coast of New Guinea
(Donohue 1 999a).
Of the adults, only a few use I'saka as their main means of communication. Groups of
older women are sometimes heard conversing solely in I'saka, but for the most part Tok Pisin
holds sway in conversation between speakers of all age groups. Among the younger adults,
use of I'saka is usually restricted to inserting I'saka vocabulary items into Tok Pisin sentences.
This is common linguistic practice among most of the villagers, and probably represents the
future of the I'saka language: fluent young speakers are rare, though in town (Vanirno)
I'saka is the language of solidarity between speakers, even if they are only partial speakers.
The use of Tok Pisin vocabulary in I'saka sentences is also common, particularly with
verbs. I n these instances, Tok Pisin words are usually employed as specifiers for the 'light'
verb -ei 'do' (see §5.3.1). For example, a common way of expressing the concept 'write' in
I'saka is to use the Tok Pisin verb raitim , 'write' combined with the inflected form of the
I'saka verb 'do'. Thus, 'I write' would be expressed as raitim d-ei ('write I-do').
In addition to dominating the private sphere, Tok Pisin is the public language of the
village. Meetings, school and church are all conducted almost entirely in Tok Pisin.
However, we observed that in the middle of important village occasions, such as the Easter
Weekend bonfire, some announcements would also be made in I'saka. This was despite the
fact that the occasion was attended by a non-Krisa priest from the Diocese. Such use is a
means of establishing ethnolinguistic solidarity (see also § 1 . 3 .2, below).",[26]
"There is good evidence that the number opposition must be modelled as two features,
singular versus non-singular, and plural versus non-plural, rather than having a single, three­
value feature. The reason that these groupings are used is that suppletive or prefixal object
marking on the verb refers to a grouping of (SG + D U ) versus PL; this suggests some
commonality between the singular and the dual, as opposed to the plural. Further, there are
some processes that refer to SG versus (DU + PL). Standard conventions apply so that [+SG]
automatically confers the value [-PL], and vice versa. By this classification dual is in a sense
an unmarked category; this surprising result is reflected in the treatment of all dual numbers
as showing the same consonant in subject prefixation (§5 .2 .2). On the other hand,
underspecification means that the dual numbers are the only ones that have to bear a marked
feature for both [SG] and [PL], albeit a negative value.
The gender system shows a clear marking pattern with masculine as the marked category,
a category composed of animate male entities and items immediately associated with them,
versus a generic 'default' non-masculine gender that is not semantically definable except as4546Chapter 4being non-masculine. In the pronouns, masculine is marked only on the singular forms, also
suggesting that masculine is more marked than non-masculine.
The formal realisation of case marking is somewhat opaque, though the formal
relationship between the possessive forms and the accusative, and the appearance of a clearly
segmentable formative -pu in the nominative, point to the fundamental difference being
between the unmarked set and the accusative set; these are the only pronoun sets that do not
show a derivational (albeit simply historical) relationship, or some overlap in function. The
free pronouns for singular are shown in Table 20.

omuThe pronouns in Table 20 show the segmental phonemes which typify the persons, and
which are also found in the verbal affixes to mark subject, object and dative. These are the
use of Idl for first person, fbi for second person, Ik/ for third person masculine, and Iwl or lui
for third person non-masculine. It is also worth noting that the accusative pronouns, marked
by a high vowel Iii and (in careful speech) lei, bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes (shown in Table 27), and probably reflect a close historical relationship. However,
unlike the object-marking suffixes, the accusative pronoun always precedes the verb, and is
not bound; the grammaticalisation pathway between the two forms is at best distant. There
are again striking resemblances between the accusative pronouns and the possessive ones,
which appear to consist of the reduced accusative plus the dative suffix (see §5.2.4). The
nominative set is marked by the recurrence of the final sequence pu, which shows intriguing
phonological similarities to the same sequence in other contexts (these include its appearance
as a common adverbial ending, suggesting a common sense of 'performance of an action' as
a component of the meaning of the [once-productive?] formative). Furthermore, the first
vowel of all the nominative pronouns varies between e and a : in addition to the forms listed
above, dapu, bapu, kapu and wopu (not *wapu , showing clear influence of the initial w) are
also heard for the nominative, from the same speakers that produce depu, etc . The same
applies to the last vowel of the accusative pronouns: in addition to being optionally omitted,
older speakers are known to use an a instead of e : dia, bia , kia , thus collapsing the
unmarkedlaccusative distinction for the 3 SG.M.
As mentioned above, the unmarked personal pronouns can be marked for cases. They are
able to carry a case marker for accompaniment, sa , and function as adjuncts in clauses (see
§5 . 1 .2). Like proper names, the unmarked personal pronouns may also occasionally combine
with their corresponding dative suffixes. This creates another alternative possessive pronoun.

l SG.POSSThe motivation behind a speaker's choice of the nominative pronoun + dative suffix
combination over the possessive pronouns is unclear, though it might be that the unmarked
pronoun + dative suffix strategy is more 'colloquial' or 'informal' than the use of thePronominal forms47dedicated possessive pronouns. More extensive and systematic checking of texts is needed to
confirm this hypothesis. Not enough data is available to draw any conclusions about the
discourse conditions that motivate one strategy over another, and speakers all report that the
unmarked pronoun + dative suffix strategy may replace a possessive pronoun in all contexts
queried.","[63, 64, 65]"

"1 0 Word lists and list of
grammatical morphemesNo lexicographic materials are available in popular print for the I'saka language, and it is
unlikely that they will appear in the near future. Partly in order to counter this dearth of
materials, we have included some word lists of the basic elements of the language.
We have presented a comprehensive basic word list in § 1 0. 1 , followed in § 1 0.2 by several
lists of species names and natural world terms. These are words which have been recorded by
Willy Wou Wake, of Krisa village. Some of these terms were not checked, and have been
presented in Willy's orthography as he wrote it. These are listed in a different font,
appearing sans serif: the word list that has been checked appears in italics, as a checked
form, following the conventions used for transcribing other I'saka sentences in this book.
Following this is an alphabetically sorted list of these same words, and a short summary
of the grammatical morphemes in the language, including references to where they are
discussed.","[126, 127]"
"The productivity of this construction with loan words, and the non-compositional nature
of the semantics of the resulting complex verb, implies that it is a highly salient construction
in need of more investigation. It should not be thought that the number of Tok Pisin
borrowings in these constructions indicates that the language has a deficient or less rich
system of expression, or that it is currently undergoing massive relexification and/or
language shift. In addition to sentences like A d-o pig 1 SG-do, meaning 'I shot a pig', people
in Krisa also say A sutim d-o, with Tok Pisin sutim 'shoot' incorporated into the structure as
a semantically specific adjunct nominal. Even though there is a (clearly recent) explicit
coding strategy for 'shooting', the non-adjunct nominal construction with nothing more than
the light verb 'do' is also perfectly acceptable and normal, albeit (from a European linguistic
perspective) highly underspecified semantically. The cultural context (what do people do to
pigs?), given the discourse in which it occurs (what do people do to pigs, in the bush, when
they've taken their dog and bow and a handful of arrows?), make the various, linguistically
ambiguous, uses of the light verb perfectly communicative for I'saka speakers. A similar
strategy has been noted in populous Dravidian languages such as Tamil, using English words
as adjuncts to the light verb 'do', alongside native lexemes, with no evidence of language
shift or even necessarily diglossia operating.",[91]
"5. 7.5 DubitativeThe dubitative marker wo is found at the end of clauses as a marker of uncertainty on the
part of the speaker about the truth of the utterance. It may be used as a marker of
evidentiality, to indicate that the speaker is not vouching for the veracity of the statement, or
it may be a marker of uncertainty about the future plausibility of the sentence:
(23 3)Tra

"66Chapter 5satisfaction), the pupil can be coded preverbally, and a pronoun can be accusative. If the
pupil did not take to the instruction as well as the teachers would have wished, then the pupil
can be coded postverbally. The following examples were noted in spontaneous language
instruction from I'saka speakers. In the first example, the pupil did end up learning to make
an acceptable string bag, and so may be coded preverbally:
( 1 26)Gertrude die
lainim wii.
Gertrude 1 SG.ACC teach 3SG.NM .do
'Gertrude taught me (to make string bags). 'In this next example the pupil was not perceived as being so astute in learning, and so is
coded as dative. If an independent pronoun was present it would appear postverbally, and
could not be an accusative pronoun.
( 1 27)Wei
lainim d-ei-ma.
language teach 1 SG-do-2SG.DAT
'I 've been trying to teach you to speak our language. 'Note that the fact that there is an alternation between the postverbal, and datively indexed
nominal in ( 1 25) and the preverbal P in ( 1 23) does not mean that the postverbal nominal is
also a P of the sentence. The evidence against this analysis involves the possibilities for the
scope of a floated adjective, presented in §6. 1 .3 .
The only occurrences of preverbal expressions referring to the argument that is indexed by
dative suffixes are found when the referent is an experiencer. Firstly, the experiencer of an
involuntary state verb may appear before the causing state:
( 1 28)dakai
wii-na.
Depu
1 SG.NOM sneeze.NM 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT
'I sneezed. 'I n this case the nominative case on the experiencer shows that it cannot be treated a s the
object of the verb. The accusative case is not possible here: if the experiencer appears before
the causing state, then it must be nominative or unmarked.
( 1 29)*die dakai wiinaOther involuntary state predicates appear with a body part as the preverbal nominal. In
these cases the dative suffixes are still possible, such as is found with wiy 'wet' :
( 1 30)Ta ' wiy-na.
skin wet- 1 SG.DAT
'I'm wet. ' ('My skin is wet. '?)It is also grammatical to mark the possessor just with a possessive pronoun in the NP that
occurs preverbally; in these cases, a greater degree of affectedness is expressed than that in a
clause with dative suffixes on the predicate (note that the predicate in this clause is an
adjective, and not a verb, but the same is true for verbal clauses):
(1 3 1 )Ta ' dina
wiy.
skin 1 SG .POSS wet
'I'm really wet. 'When a free pronoun i s used with this construction, i t appears i n the accusative case:Morphology( 1 32)Die
ta l ma-na .
l SG.ACC skin hot- 1 sG.DAT
'I'm hot.'","[83, 84, 85]"
"5.3.2 Adjunct nominalsNouns also play a prominent role in building complex and explicit predicate semantics for
clauses which use the light verb -ei 'do' as their main inflecting verb. This is done in two
main ways: either through the use of a preverbal non-inflecting nominal specifier, for
example makaing in the complex predicate makaing d-ei 'I help' ; or through knowledge of
the nature of the main participants. For an example of this latter strategy, a clause consisting
of a human subject, an animate animal object, and the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted as
'(Human) shoots/kills (animal)', based on the shared knowledge of the cultural world in
which I'saka speakers live. In a sentence with a human subject and a normally human-made
tool or artifact as the object, the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted to mean 'make, process'.",[89]
"1. 4.3Vernacular literacyThere is very little material available in the I'saka language. Writing the I'saka language
has very much been a matter of individual choice. As far as we are aware, there have been
only a few attempts by villagers to write their language, although Stefanie Klappa stirred
speaker interest in this area. Most people were reasonably keen to try writing I'saka when
asked, and one proved to be a prolific writer, producing pages of sentences and lists of plants
and animals. These were written with an idiosyncratic and unsystematic adaptation of the
Tok Pisin orthography, with no systematic indication of nasalisation or tone. This served the
author quite well to write with, but sometimes required a lot of effort to decode (read), even
for the writer himself. The current I'saka orthography is discussed in §2.7.
Adult responses to the notion of a vernacular literacy program within the village school
were unfailingly positive, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The teachers were pleased at
the thought of a suitable orthography and some vernacular literacy materials, as they are
now officially supposed to use I'saka as a vehicle for teaching initial reading and writing
skills. However, for the reasons outlined below, it is difficult to see how a vernacular literacy
program for the early grades would progress.
At the time of our work, two of the three teachers at the Krisa school I'saka speaker as she
has been away from the village for many years. This means that teachers of any proposed
vernacular literacy programme would be attempting to instruct children in a language that
would be largely unknown to themselves, and not used in day-to-day interaction by the
children, a clearly problematic situation (although not unusual in Papua New Guinea).
Another important factor is that many Krisa children do not use any I'saka with their families
and converse solely in Tok Pisin, making the language of 'first literacy' unfamiliar to both
teachers and pupils. We might expect that family language use would alter if the school were
able to commence a strong I'saka-based programme, but even so it would be an uphill battle
given the level of Tok Pisin use in all spheres of life.",[30]
"2. 7. 1 Speakers' views on the graphic representation of toneNo speaker of I'saka spontaneously expressed any prior awareness that their language was
tonal. Finding an appropriate vocabulary to discuss tone (in Tok Pisin) with Krisa people was
extremely challenging, and this was never wholly resolved. Speakers would certainly
innovate ways of describing the characteristics of the different tone melodies, but these were
rarely consistent. At this early stage, there was no set of Tok Pisin or I'saka words or phrases
that caught people's imagination to the extent that they could be satisfactorily mapped onto
the tone melodies (see also §2.2). This made discussion of the tone-marking scheme rather
difficult, but attempts were made to find out I'saka speakers' views on the matter.
People we discussed the orthography with were generally supportive of the tone-marking
scheme, and some people (particularly the younger adults) were quite delighted with it. They
felt it was important for showing 'correct pronunciation', and took the challenge of writing
the tone-marks very seriously. It is possible, however, that they were simply agreeing with
the tone-marks because the orthographer seemed to think they were important, and because
they were novel and somewhat intriguing. Additionally, the presence of the tone-marks
supported the idea that I 'saka was special (since Tok Pisin and English do not use diacritics),
and that writing I'saka was something out of the ordinary.",[52]
"A literal glossing of this sentence is impossible. The accusative pronoun, in preverbal
position, signals that 'I ' should be glossed as 'me': '(it) sickens me'. Despite this, the dative
suffixes following the verb imply that we are dealing with a possessor or beneficiary: '(it)
sickens forlon me'. We are thus in a dilemma about the grammatical function associated
with the first person singular participant in (267): the dative suffixes imply that it is an
oblique, and the accusative case implies that it is object.
Other involuntary state sentences do not use dative suffixing:92Chapter 6(268)Pi
di
k-ang.
rain.M l SG.ACC 3SG.M-wet
'The rain soaked me. 'In addition to sentences of the sort seen in (267) and (268) the experiencer may also
appear in a nominative case (or, as is true of almost all constructions, the unmarked case,
which for example (269) would mean coding the l sG pronoun as nana). This is found only
if the argument in question appears before a causing event, and if an experiencer argument is
called for by the construction. A nominative experience is illustrated in the following
example, where the predicate ('sick') subcategorises for an experiencer, causing the sickness
to be manifested in that experiencer.
(269)wii-na.
Depu
l SG.NOM 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT
'I 'm sick.'","[109, 110]"
"The following ungrammatical 'near-misses ' corresponding to the sentence above show
that, firstly, the dative suffixes are obligatory for this verb; secondly, that the accusative
pronoun may not be postverbal, and thirdly that, even if not overtly accusative, a pronominal
P may not follow the verb.
( 1 48)*dapu hi dakaing( 1 49)*dapu dakaingma hi( 1 50)*dapu dakaingma mamaIt should be clear from the preceding discussion that the many issues involved with the
dative suffixes in I'saka are far from being completely resolved, and that these affixes are
multifunctional in the sense that they appear to mark not only some oblique arguments on the
verb, but also the P of a variety of low-transitive clauses (providing, in effect, an oblique-Morphology69coding strategy similar to the conative in English). It should not be thought that all low­
transitive clauses mark their P by means of the dative suffixes, or even the postverbal
position. In the case of -ele ' 'go, follow' a goal appears postverbally, but without indexing on
the verb (see §4. 1 . 1 ). This is true for both goals, as in the example in §4. 1 . 1 , and for 'things
followed', as in the example below:
(1 5 1 )Dapu
d-ele ' pli-pa . . .
1 SG.NOM 1 SG-go road-sEQ
'I followed the road (and then . . . ). 'The following clause is clearly (both from its internal semantics, and from a cross­
linguistic study) low in transitivity, yet does not employ either of these low-transitivity coding
options:
( 1 52)d-akai.
wi
Dapu
1 SG.NOM water l SG-cut
'I crossed the river. 'Some additional issues involving the positioning of the dative, and its status a s an affix or
clitic, are raised in §5 .7. 1 .","[86, 87]"
"4. 1. 1 Unmarked pronounsThe unmarked pronoun is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, appearing
in a wider range of contexts than any of the other pronominal sets. The referent can be a
subject or dative referent, and at times the unmarked set of pronouns is even used as
possessive pronouns. Additionally, an overtly marked oblique pronoun must be drawn from
the unmarked set (such as accompanying participants, which are marked with tro attached to
a pronoun from the unmarked set, as in (95) in §5 . 1 .2). The only restriction on the function
of this pronominal set is that it may not be used to mark a referent which is the object of a
bivalent clause.
It is not yet well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked pronominal forms
when a more highly specified, and equally suitable pronominal set is available for the
function required, such as the nominative pronouns for subjects or the possessive pronouns
for objects.
Examples of the use of the unmarked pronouns in different syntactic contexts appear in
the sentences below.
(62)(63)(64)(65)Unmarked pronoun as subject of a bivalent clause:
n-ou.
Nana tra

sago.delight l SG-eat

'You carried my child. '
Unmarked pronoun as un-indexed oblique:
Kapu k-ele '
umu.
3SG.M 3SG.M-go 3SG.NM
'He went to her.'
(The meaning encoded in this sentence would be more commonly
expressed with a dative suffix on the verb: Kapu k-ele-ung 'He went to
her', Kepu k-au-na 'He came to me'.)48Chapter 4From the wide range of functions in which the unmarked set of pronouns appears it is
clear that they are not specified for grammatical features other than the pronominal ones that
they exist to mark.","[65, 66]"
"As indicated in the examples above, the dubitative particle is often lengthened, [WJ:::] .
Further, it is associated with a slow down-gliding intonation contour, both on the particle
itself and to a lesser extent on the rest of the preceding clause. An additional example of this
particle, in a richer context, can be seen in the text in §7.4.",[102]
"3.4 AdjectivesAs mentioned above, adjectives display some of the characteristics of both nouns and
verbs, but remain distinct from them morphosyntactically. A significant proportion of
adjectival roots appear to be morphologically complex, bearing a (historical?) suffix -pa that
is not observed on either nouns or verbs. The meaning of this morpheme is synchronically
opaque, and it appears to be a fossilised affix of some sort. Some examples include ino-pa
'far away', amo-pa 'many', asong-pa 'stealthy' and kai-pa 'one'; the putative roots of these
words, ino, a m o , a so and kai, are never found without the putative suffix -pa , so the
meaning of this putative suffix cannot be determined. The distantly related Skou language
(see § 1 .2, Figure 3) similarly has a disproportionate number of adjectives ending in the
inseparable putative suffix -fa : kukufa 'quick', hahafa 'slow', etc. This would be a likely
cognate with the I'saka -pa formative, suggesting that any productivity lies for the most part
in the distant past of the languages.
Morphologically, adjectives (and no other word classes) may occur with a postposed
intensifying particle ni', as is shown in the examples below.",[59]
"5.2.3 Object inflectionIndependent bivalent verbs can be divided into two morphologically distinct classes. The
first class, a minority pattern, marks the gender and number (singular/dual being relevantly
grouped together as non-plural, NPL, opposed to plural, PL) of the object on the verb. This
may be accomplished in one of two ways: either through the use of suppletive verb-forms, or
through the use of more delimitable affixation - 'delimitable' in the sense that the
correspondences of pronominal values to the segments employed for their encoding match
the paradigms seen elsewhere. (In fact, calling this 'affixation' may be jumping the gun as
there are too few examples known to be sure that we are really dealing with regular affixes
that mean 'masculine non-plural object', etc., as opposed to patterns of lexical suppletion.)
Table 26 shows two examples of the class of verbs that mark some value of the object by
suppletive verb forms; the examples given here have been inflected for first person singular
subject (d-) as well as the inflection for object. The first example, with the verb -ai 'get' ,
shows what may b e analysable a s object affixes. The rightmost column illustrates the
patterns found with the verb -ei 'do', and shows object-governed suppletion, or at best objectMorphology61affixation and major morphophonological changes. Although the prevalence of suppletive
forms makes it difficult to posit a root for the verb 'do', the third person non-masculine
object form -ei is considered to be the most unmarked, in terms of its range of application,
frequency of occurrence, and appearance in elicitation. As such, it has been treated as the
underlying form throughout.
Table 26: Object prefixes'take, get', [-aj]'do', [-ej]SUBJOBJl SG3NPL.NMd-aid-ei3NPL.Md-akaid-o3PLd-alaid-ouIf the verb 'take' in the table above illustrates a productive (or at least regular, and not
entirely suppletive) object marking pattern, then the morphemes used to index the values of
,
the object are prefixal to the verb root; the morphological structure of 'I take (masculine)
would most logically be PrefsuBJ-PrefoBJ-V, as in the following segmented example.
( 1 07)d-ak-ai
l SG-3SG.NPL.M-take
,
'I take (masculine)Here the use of the k consonant in the prefix is reminiscent of the appearance of this
consonant in various places in paradigms involving third person singular masculine
arguments. We would posit the prefixes ak- and al-, the only consonant-final morphemes in
the language. With 'do', however, it is hard to isolate a single element that can be said to be
added to an otherwise basically invariant verb root. It could well be the case that prefixes of
the form V- and VG- are added and the rhyme of the prefix overwrites that of the verb root,
in a process similar to that described for vowel coalescence when subject prefixes of the
shape CV - are added to verbs (§5 .2.2). If this is the case, the prefixes are 0- '3NPL.M .OBJ'
and ou- 'PL.OBJ' (/'Jw/). An example of the verb 'do' inflected for non-plural masculine
object is given in:
( 1 08)[d'J]

(See §5.2.2 for a discussion of the process of rhyme replacement in verbs
following the syllabification of extrametrical elements, arguing that rather
than simply vowel replacement, there is a more complex process involved.)For ease of glossing, only the features 'plural ' and 'masculine' will be indicated in the
gloss lines, as these seem to represent elements that, historically at least, were added to the
roots. Thus, d-ei will be glossed simply as l sG-do, not l SG-do.NPL.NM ; d-o will be glossed
as l sG-do.M, and d-ou as l sG-do.pL. The features non-singular and non-masculine will not
be explicitly marked in the glosses, as they represent the unmarked categories.
In addition to these verbs with irregular (in the sense of less easily segmentable) means of
marking object values on the verb, a small and semantically distinct subset of this class takes
a regular set of suffixes that indicate number, person and gender of a human object (H .OBJ).","[78, 79]"

"5 .4. 1 Causation and resulting statesCausation is expressed in I'saka in one of several ways, depending partly on the lexical
valency of the verb, and partly on idiosyncratic factors. Additionally, where some verbs may
be used both monova1ently and bivalently, there can be restrictions on the aspect that is
grammatical with the monovalent use that specifies the resulting or prior state.
We can identify the following relationships between monovalent and bivalent events
describing the same state but with the element of causation added:
1.the same verb is used for both senses, with no morphological modification;2.a different verb is used; the monovalent verb may not be used with an object,
and the bivalent verb may not be used without an object;3.the verb from one category (bivalent or monovalent) may be used i n the other
(monovalent or bivalent) with the addition of some (detransitivising or
transiti vising) morphosyntax .",[93]
"3.2 NounsNouns are the most phonotactically varied of the word classes, with no restrictions on their
phonological shape (unlike verbs, see §3.3). Morphologically nouns are uninflected for
gender, number, or other categories, but are divided into two genders, masculine, M, and non­
masculine, NM . Gender is realised only through verbal morphology, in the choice of prefix,Chapter 340suffix, or suppletive stem forms of verbs. The non-masculine gender is the unmarked form,
found with most animals, although some (e.g. pigs, the most culturally important and valued
animal) are masculine. Natural powers such as wind and rain are predominantly masculine,
with au 'moon' and (po)kisi 'night' being expected exceptions (this conforms to the cross­
linguistic data in Craig 1 986). Inanimate things such as plants and features of the landscape,
as well as household items, are almost exclusively non-masculine.
I n addition to the pervasive, but morphologically unmarked in the NP, gender distinction
there is also a division between animate referents and inanimates. This is discussed in §5 .3.3,
where the choice of verb of location appears to be governed by pragmatic animacy factors.
There is evidence for some additional classing behaviour in I'saka, though it is no longer
productive, and shows no concord anywhere in the language. We can observe, however, a
more than chance series of phonological correspondences:
•
•
••nearly all birds show an initial [i] or [j] ;
furry game animals show an initial [a];
many hairless (and grammatical non-masculine) creatures, such as lizards and
various water creatures, show an initial [u] or [w];
bandicoots tend to begin with [bi].
(examples can be seen in the word lists in Chapter 1 0)While this has not been thoroughly checked, there does appear to be a strong tendency in
the Border languages Mnanki (and Man�m) for the names of birds to start with [i] or [j], and
for water creatures and game creatures to show an initial [a], and so on. This is also possibly
true in Fakmo (Bewani) as well, although in this language it is less striking (own fieldnotes,
2002-03).","[57, 58]"

the completive marker must occur sentence finally. From the sentences in §5.2.4 we can see
that the dative suffixes occur final on the verb, but freely allow nominals to appear in the
same clause following them. Sentences such as (2 1 5) thus run counter to the prediction that82Chapter 5we would find the dative suffix final on the verb, followed by the (possibly enclitic)
completive particle. At this point we have no clear explanation for this discrepancy.","[99, 100]"
"Morphology57I n these examples Duwe Damien-ka functions as the predicate, and the possessor Damien
appears with the dative suffix. Similarly, in the second sentence pa i is marked with the
dative suffixes as a possessor. When a possessor appears inside an NP modifying the head
noun this use of dative suffixes is also possible, but it is more common simply to juxtapose
the nouns. While both of the following phrases are possible, the first is more common and
more 'natural' than the second.
(98) a. wei

'Damien's house'
b. wei

Note that, regardless of the presence or absence of a dative suffix on the possessor, the
possessor must follow the unmarked possessum.
5.2 Verbal morphologyWhile some morphology is unique to nominals, verbs are the locus of all obligatory
morphology in I'saka, and show both the greatest range and greatest complexity of
morphological forms. I n this section we shall examine the inflection for person that is found
on the verb, following a morpheme template for the verb.
5.2. 1 Morpheme orderingMorphemes are strictly ordered in the verb in I'saka, though the reduplicative element
used to mark irrealis mood applies a template to a segmental string that includes both the root
and the prefix. Section 5 .7.1 discusses some variation in the order of the final morphemes in
this verbal string with sentence final particles. The order of the different morphemes on the
verb is as follows:
SUBJ-VROOT(.OBJ) - (Human OBJ), (EVID) - (DAT)
« IRR»
Subject is obligatorily encoded either prefixally or through suppletion of the verb root,
with different verb stems being used for subjects of differing number or gender. The most
extreme example of this is the verb 'do', which uses apparently completely unrelated forms
- see Table 26. Objects are encoded either suppletively (in which case they determine the
vowel of the syllable reduplicated for irrealis verbs - see §2.4 and §2 . 5 ), or suffixally. It is
not known whether human object suffixes are placed before or after the evident morpheme,
though the semantics of the evident morpheme and the limited class of verbs that can take
human object suffixes would not appear to be compatible. The dative suffix is always placed
word-finally, as in the examples below, which show the dative suffix in combination with the
human object suffix in (99), and the evident temporallrealis morpheme combined with the
dative suffix in (100) (there is, however, some doubt as to the status of the dative suffix as
suffix or as clitic: see § 5 .7.1).","[74, 75]"
"3.1 Major word classesNouns and verbs are the two major word classes, being most obviously morphologically
distinct in that verbs show agreement and nouns do not, even when predicative. This can be
seen in the following pair of sentences, in which the verb -oung 'eat' appears with a prefix
that agrees with the subject of the clause, while tisa in (44), a noun, shows no such prefix,
nor other (more plausible) morphology which is the norm on verbs.

'I 'm a teacher. 'At least five further distinct classes can be distinguished. These include Adjectives,
Temporals, Deictics, Clause-relevant particles and Postpositions.
The Adjective class (including quantifiers) displays elements of the morphological
characteristics of both nouns and verbs. Like verbs, adjectives may encode arguments with
the dative suffix. However, like nouns (and unlike verbs), they show no agreement for
person, number and gender of subject or object.

other word classes) may occur with a postposed intensifying particle nil, as in:
(47)nil.

bivalently, and if the latter may appear with dative suffixes marking the P.

"Syntax956.5 Clause chainingAdjacent verbs may sometimes share constituents, even when they do not form a serial
verb construction. Object noun phrases are normally obligatory in bivalent clauses, but may
be omitted if the clause immediately prior has the same object. Intonation patterns show that
these are distinct clauses, rather than serial verbs:
(283)Sit
d-ai,
n-ou.
sago l SG-get l SG-eat
'I got some sago, and ate [it]. 'I n the following sentence the oblique argument i s represented by a full independent
pronoun in the second clause, even though it is completely recoverable from the verbal
agreement:

b-o
n-rlni-ma
mama.
like.that 2SG-do.M l SG-be.angry.at-2sG.DAT 2SG
'If you behave like that, I 'll be cross at you. 'The following example shows that the clause-final completive particle y a may also be
shared over two clauses. Again, we see the object noun phrase omitted in the second clause:
(285)Sit
bima
ble d-akai, n-ou
ya .
sago 2SG.POSS that l SG-cut l SG-eat COMP
'I prepared that sago of yours, and ate [it]. 'It is, of course, possible to link two monovalent clauses. The following sentence shows
two clauses with a shared oblique nominal, appearing final in the chain of verbs:
(286)Dapu
d-ele ' d-iy
wfysau pule.
l SG.NOM l SG-go l SG-sleep forest bush.camp
'I went and slept in the bush camp. 'Another option for linking clauses involves the use of the sequential marker -pa (see also
the texts in Chapter 7). This can be seen in the following textual extracts:

tau d-ei
mi.
l SG-go stealthy-SEQ INTENSE noise l SG-do NEG
'I went along very stealthily, I didn't make any noise.'","[112, 113]"
"5 .4.2 Valency reduction: reflexives and reciprocalsThere is no morphology associated exclusively with reflexive or reciprocal clauses.
Rather, the regular bivalent pattern is used, with nouns or pronouns referring to the same
participants appearing as both the A and the P of the clause. This is shown in the example
below; note that, while a free (nominative or unmarked) pronoun referring to the 'A' is not
required (or natural), the accusative pronoun referring to the 'P' is obligatory:Morphology(1 8 1 )77d-elei.

(not grammatical with the meaning 'I saw myself', but acceptable
,
for 'I saw (something) )Reciprocals are in the main morphosyntactically identical to reflexives, and ambiguous.
The necessarily plural reference of reciprocal constructions means that there is no separate
pronoun indicating the P, but an unmarked pronoun is obligatory to refer to the combined
subject:

(Good with the unlikely reading 'They twoi hit those twoj/*i', but not
as a reciprocal)The obligatoriness of the free pronoun does mean that there is a syntactic structure that is
uniquely associated with the reflexive/reciprocal construction, albeit one that is dependent on
pre-existing morphology. An alternative, and not widely attested, reciprocal construction
involves the light verb 'do' and a clause fully specified for all its arguments, with both A and
P at least optionally present:

"1.3.2 Language attitudesThere is a definite sense of endangerment in Krisa, with older people in particular
expressing distress at the perceived loss of the I'saka language. Simon Tapi, the head of one
of the seven Krisa clans and also an important church leader, described the situation in the
following terms (this conversation was largely in English; phrases in italics have been
translated from Tok Pisin):
Some people, they don't pronounce the wording [of I'saka] correctly, they twist the
wording - so you have to be careful of that. Some young people don't speak dialectvery often, that's why. I'll say this [a story] in local language again, the way it is
supposed to be spoken, how willI say, like our great ances tors and our parents. [ . . . ]In church, I don't talk in local language, I use Tok Pisin. That's where we are wrong
there. In church, if Krisa people, then we can speak dialect straight away, quickly.
But there are some people from other places, other villages, that's why we don't
speak dialect usually, usually no. Krisa people would understand though. Some ofthese young people too they don't speak dialect. That's one of the problems here.",[27]
"Note that this is an example in which the adjective (nuo 'big') appears adjacent to the noun
rather than after the verb, despite the fact that no peripheral argument is present. This may be
because of the presence of the completive particle, or because subject-linked adjectives
cannot follow serialised verbs. However, from (293) we can see that an object-linked
adjective may follow this sort of complex predicate. Note that in this sentence there is no
completive particle.

"5. 1.2 Accompaniment and locationThe case markers sa and tro appear on some oblique noun phrases to more closely specify
the meaning than simply general oblique, which is implied by the NP appearing in a
postverbal position. Sa is used to show accompaniment, and tro can be used with this
function, or to indicate a specifically interior location (within). The former, sa, is used only
infrequently, and not accepted by some speakers; for those that do use it, sa appears at the
start of the NP, not final. Tro is often omitted from speech, with the simple locative coding
sufficing for its sense.
Examples of these case markers can be seen in the following phrases:

"6.2 Involuntary state subjectsIn many languages of New Guinea an involuntary state is usually coded with the
experiencer as the apparent object of the construction and the stimulus as a nominal (in
contrast to reference-dominated languages like English in which the experiencer is coded as
the subject of the event). In I'saka the construction most closely resembles the New Guinea
norm, but the experiencer, while appearing in accusative case (if it is pronominal) is marked
on the verb with dative suffixes. This might reflect the fact that dative suffixes are more
productive than is strict object marking on the verb, but may also reflect the semantic role
associated with the experiencer.
The predicate 'sick', for instance, is expressed with a morphological non-subject. We can
call it a non-subject only because the morphology coding of the argument is not consistent:
based on the form of the pronoun we would think that I SG was an object, but based on the
fact that it is indexed by a dative suffix on the verb we are led to believe that it is an oblique.

"2. 1.2 VowelsMost I'saka speakers distinguish five vowels, shown in Table 3 below. A few older
speakers also distinguish a sixth vowel, the high central rounded [\:1], but for the majority of
speakers this is no longer distinct from luI, and even in the speech of those speakers that do
produce an [\:1], it is found in free variation with the [u] , indicating that it is possibly a
phoneme that has almost completely disappeared from the language.

front segment, to [re], and of hi to [0] following a high back segment. There is also some
slight raising of these mid vowels when they precede a glide, and dissimilation of high vowels
preceding a glide of the same backness; these processes are described in §2.5. 1 .
Some examples of monosyllabic minimal or near-minimal vocalic contrasts are shown

'woman'Vowel patterns in polysyllabic words can only be investigated in detail for disyllabic roots,
as there are almost no examples of monomorphemic roots with three or more syllables (see
§2 .6). When we do look at the patterns that come up, we find that the perhaps predicted
twenty-five (5 x 5) possible (C)V(C)V combinations on (monomorphemic) disyllabic words
are not all attested, as seen in Table 4 (the gap for E(C)J most likely reflects a gap in the data,
and not a true phonological restriction).

historically at least, there have been patterns of vowel harmony operating within a root, such
that high vowels in a root must all share the same values for backness. This rule does not
apply to compounds in modern I'saka, as can be seen in several tree species names such as
tiru (see § 1 0.2), nor does it apply to multimorphemic roots with suffixes, such as Ik-adf-UI

"1. 4. 1 Acquiring literacyThe village school in Krisa has three or four grades running at any one time (selected
from Prep 1 , Prep 2, and Grades 1 -6), and teaches children from about age seven or eight to
the early teens. The actual school grades taught change from year to year, keeping pace with
the enrolled children and restricted by the number of teachers. (For example, one year they
will have grades 1 , 3 and 5, the next year 2, 4 and 6). For schooling beyond Grade 6,
children must leave the village and go to a high school or vocational college. In truth, it is
difficult to define exactly how things are 'organised', but most children go to school some of
the time, and the school is certainly an important focus of community life.
Currently, children are first taught first literacy in Tok Pisin, and this shifts to English in
the second or third year of schooling. Neither the English language nor the English
orthography are actually 'mastered' at the village school. The teachers themselves, although
they are presumably quite familiar with written English, do not speak the language
comfortably or fluently. This is a confusing but quite common pedagogic situation in PNG.
Conversely, the Tok Pisin orthography is mastered within the village itself. Additionally, quite
a few children make frequent trips to Vanimo with their family, and so are exposed to the
more print-dependent town world.",[29]

unattested triple onset. Because of the stipulativeness of this approach in the modern

l'saka. This is not because the stop does not lenite, but rather because it has already
undergone a historical process by which this segment completely lenited to form a new
phoneme in these positions. Complications with this analysis are discussed in §2.6 . 3 , but it
should be noted that older speakers have adapted some loans that start with the sequence [si-]
to a stop, and not a fricative. For instance, the place name Singapore [' SI l)g I P:): ] has been

the point is that the dative suffixes cannot be used to index an inanimate target.
It is interesting that the P of the verb -elei 'see, look ' is not always encoded by the dative
suffix. I n relatively high-transitivity instances of the verb (e.g. 'watch' as opposed to 'see'),
the P is treated morphologically and syntactically as a normal object, and not as an argument
that may be encoded with the oblique-marking dative suffixes.4 In the following examples,
we see the patient-referent represented by a preverbal accusative pronoun ( 1 22), and as a
noun phrase occupying the preverbal object position ( 1 2 3). This contrasts with the post­
verbal placement of the low-affect P-referent pronoun mama in ( 1 1 5) above.
