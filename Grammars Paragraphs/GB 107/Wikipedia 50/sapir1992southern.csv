"Negative forms are generally preceded by the negative adverb
qatcv-, less often qa. The latter, though closely attached to the
following word, is not a prefix, as shown by the unaffected phonetic
treatment of the negatived word, e. g.:
rii' qa q ari'ywa'"" I not stay-negative, I was absent
mam u'c v qa yura'<t>Axqaq'wai't iini they are unconquerable
qatcu- is evidently compounded of qa and an element -tcu- which clearly goes back to spirantized -tu- (cf. usitative participle -vatä- < -va-t'i-,
§ 25, 6, c; and postpositions in -pa-tc . . .- < -pa-t . . . - , § 50, 4, 37);
this is proven by comparative evidence, cf. Mono gadu, garu NOT.
The noun, independent pronoun, or verb that is negatived is provided
with a negative suffix or negative modification of a verbalizing suffix.
All such negative elements contain a glottal stop. Somewhat
infrequently, negative forms are found unpreceded by a negative
adverb.
(1) NEGATIVED NOUNS AND PRONOUNS. All nouns and independent pronouns, including nominal derivatives of verbs (e. g. past

usitative participles (cf. § 25, 6, c) end in -ap atci-·, for negative forms
of ordinary active participles in -fi-, see 2, b below. T h i s suffix precedes
objective -ya-.

The negative correspondent of subordinating -kai- (§ 55, 1, b) is
-ywa'ai-yu- (§ 55, 1, c), e. g.:
na 'may'waiYUcampa t),t
him (vis.) to meriiru'xwAwithout saying anything, (give)In certain forms -ywa'ai- is replaced by two-moraed -ywa'a-. The
negative form of subordinating -ku- (§ 55, 1, e) is -ywa'q u-, e. g.:
tTqa'qarjwa'qucamparaijWA
eat-plural-negative-while-only-we (inclus.), while we are not eating
There are absolute verb forms in -ψοα'αρα-, a suffix apparently
combining -ijwa'a(i)- and -apa- (see a). It is not evident how they
differ, if at all, from ordinary negative absolutes in - ap a-. Examples
are:
qatcu'tcami paa'iyoywa'ap ac υ not-preterit-they (vis.) countable
(?)-negative-again, they were many in number (paiyo- is only
used as negative verb; cf. qatcu'rarjWA paa'iyarjwa' aicv we (inclus.)
are many)
Forms in -qwa'ap a-vi- seem to be agentives of negative absolutes
in -ywa'apa- (but cf. negatived agentives in -vi'ap a-, 1 above), e. g.:
rii' qatc ampa'xAhtirjwa'ap αφι I not talk-cause-negative-agentive, I
(am) one who causes not to talk, I do not allow to talk
(c) Negative forms of verbalizing -kai-. The verbalizing suffixes
-kai- το B E and -kai- το HAVE (see § 26, 1, a and b) become -ai- in the
negative. This - ai- takes the place of any specifically negative suffix.

"A number of verb-forming suffixes are in common use. They transform noun, adjective, and demonstrative stems into verbs.
(1) Elements suffixed to noun and adjective stems.
(a) -yai-, -q ai-, -rjqai-, ΤΟ BE. Any noun or participle may become
a verb of being by means of this suffix, e. g.:

-ka -, e. g.:

"(2) A B S O L U T E V E R B FORMS. A S has been abundantly illustrated,
verb forms, even aside from nominal derivatives (§ 25, 1-6), often
appear without either enclitic or suffixed tense elements. Such
forms may be conveniently termed absolutes. They are used under
various circumstances:
(a) When tense (and pronominal) elements arc appended to another preceding word in the sentence, the verb appears as an absolute,
e. g.:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE235a'itcayani qu'qwi then-preterit-him (vis.)-I shoot, then I shot him;
contrast qu'qwi'tea-yaw
I shot him
(b) In imperative forms (see § 52).
(c) Frequently in interrogative forms, where reference is had to
present time.
(d) Generally substantive verbs (aro'a-, uru'a-, § 56) have no
present suffix, present (or general) time being implied when there is
no tense suffix.
(e) Verbs of BEING and HAVING in -Icai- (§ 26, 1, a and b) take no -xjitoexpress present time, but are tenseless, e. g. qant!%aini I HAVE A
HOUSE.
It is probable that in such cases -Icai- represents an old
contraction of -kai-y'i-, as the -y'i- reappears after an intervening
impersonal 4-ua- (see § 29, 14; § 32, 8).
§ 52. The imperative.
The imperative is only negatively determined as regards form, i. e.
by the absence of tense elements, further by the frequent absence of
the second person singular in forms that have a pronominal or nominal
object. Syntactically, imperatives are remarkable in that they
take an object in the subjective form. The pronominal subject or
object, as usual, may be appended either to the verb or to a preceding
element, e. g. hortatory iVi'- (§ 60, 2, d). Examples illustrative of
these remarks are:
ivi""i drink-thou! drink!
avi'mituywa'""
it-out of-thou! go out!
iVi'"" ivi'yu hortatory-thou drink-momentaneous! go ahead, take a

vvwa'nfini
ya'yqihi
it (inv.)-at-being (subjective)-me carry-forhither! bring me (it) over there!
Imperatives with a dual or plural subject do not seem to occur with
enclitic pronominal subject, but arc characterized instead by anX Southern Paiute and Ute
236SAPIRenclitic -ya-, appended either to the verb form or a preceding word.
In plural imperative forms the verb is plural in form; dual imperatives,
particularly if intransitive, frequently add dual pronominal enclitic
. . .ml- to -ya-: -y'am'i-. Examples of plural and dual imperatives,
with and without pronominal objects, are:
ti''qa'q a(i)rA,tVqa'qai*e a t ye!qatcu'i' minta'n'ia'p-A not-plur. imper. run (plur. verb-stem)- negative! do not run away (plur.)!

qatcu'ya-m'i yaywi""(y)ap-A
not-plur. imper.-them (vis.) carry (sing.
verb-stem)-negative! do ye 2 not carry them 2!
What is probably an emphatic imperative is sometimes formed by
appending enclitic -aqa- to the verb or a preceding word. In all
probability this -aq a- is merely an idiomatic use of enclitic pronominal
-aq a- IT (VIS.); it has the position of a pronominal enclitic. T h a t it
is not to be merely construed as a pronominal object, properly speaking,
is shown by its use with inherently intransitive as well as transitive
verbs. On the other hand, it does not seem to occur where the verb
has a true pronominal object. Examples of imperative -aqa- are:
qa-'aq-Asing!t.iy;)'q wi{y)aq·A

§ 53. Internal stem changes.
Verbal stem changes in Paiute that are of morphological significance may be classified under the heads of reduplication (see § 58,3-6),
vocalic modification, and consonantal affection. Only the two latter
are discussed at this point.
(1) VOCALIC ALTERNATIONS. Vocalic alternations are either quantitative or qualitative, the former, insofar as they are of morphologicalSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageS O U T H E R N P A I U T E , A S H O S H O N E A N LANGUAGE237significance, being relatively infrequent. In all, six types of vocalic
alternation may be recognized.
(a) Vocalic lengthening. A short vowel may be lengthened, a long
one over-lengthened (e. g. a· to a-a), to indicate the idea of I N V A I N ,
TO NO EFFECT, e .g.:qa'aplya'
sang to no effect ( < qa - to sing)
'a'aip'iya'
said without effect ( < ai- to say)
α'τηραχαΐ
talks to no purpose ( < ατηρα'χαϊ talks)
'o 'n'niy'uq WA did it (inv.) in vain ( < un Crfitq-WA did it)
These examples indicate that it is regularly the first vowel of the
word which is lengthened.
Another group of cases of vocalic lengthening seems to be associated
with the idea of continuation. Examples are not very numerous:
pini rjw'in-q n uq WLXw'aim'arjWA look-stand about (-yw'ino- < -Tjwln-'Lto stand, assimilated by following -n vq tt>t-)-run-go-future-him
(inv.), shall go to stand around looking for him

tsi 'tsnjwayaip iyain C it seemed that (arrows) were stuck in in

Perhaps ma'ni-campaBARELY is similarly lengthened from

uvwa""axl
ma-^ni'campA
ya'aqwipiya'
entered, barely escaped by going over itit(inv.)-overbarely(b) Vocalic alternation to indicate number (and voice). In certain
verbs, the final vowel is a, a·, o, or u in the intransitive singular, i in
the intransitive plural and in the transitive. Examples are:
topa-qi(tree, feather, tooth)

qap a-q-i- to stop (intr.)

paya-q i-, paq a-q i- to tear (intr.)iivi-trai-several come loose; -top in'nato pluck out one;

their final vowel between α• and i, a smaller number between yaand i. The former form of the stem is used for the active intransitive
(or transitional) voice, the latter for the medio-passive, static, or
resultative voice. The i- forms seem to be durative, the a - forms
tend to be momentaneous. Examples are:

In these

the -i- and -a - forms (cf. d above). In some cases only -i- alternates
with -a-. T h e alternation of -i- and -a- is evidently an old Uto-Aztekan

(2) CONSONANTAL AFFECTION. Two groups of cases are to be
recognized, glottalization and gemination of stem consonants. These
seem to be equivalent processes. Not infrequently they occur together in the same form, e. g. tska'pin'NA το CUT (momentaneously):
ts-kaniNA το CUT (duratively).
(a) Glottalization of verb stems. This process operates:1. To indicate distribution, e. g.:
fVA'tcü'ywiyuni
waijwi-fourseveral standyun a- to put several down (in
one place)wa'a'yWAtcÜTjwiyun C eight (lit.,
four here and there)
wa'a'rjwituip'iya' caused (them)
each to stand
yuna'(a)ito put down in several places2. To indicate iteration, e. g.:
iyon a- to carry in one's arms
ya-vayaito feariyan'na- to carry several times
yi'i-p-aq ai- to be afraid several
times (note irregular change of
-a - to -Ϊ -)3. To indicate momentaneous activity, e. g. -n'na- momentaneous
transitive with singular object: -n a- durative transitive with singular
object (§ 30, 4).
Glottalization alone as a grammatical process is relatively rare.
Generally it accompanies distributive or iterative reduplication (see
§ 58, 3 and 4), less often gemination alone (see b).
(b) Gemination in verb stems. Gemination primarily denotes
momentaneous activity; the contrast between momentaneous and
durative, as might be expected, tends to become one of singularity
and plurality. Gemination is very commonly employed with the
momentaneous suffixes -q i- (§ 30, 3) and -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c). Other
examples of momentaneous gemination are:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanSOUTHERN PAIUTE,(iyai-A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGEto happennay am- to seem

-qi- momentaneous suffix (§ 30,3)Far less frequently gemination indicates iterative activity, e. g.:
qaqafi-to run awayya-vayai-to fearqaqat'ito run away several
times
yV'i-paqaito be afraid several
timesEven these examples are really but special forms of gemmation
accompanying reduplication. Combined gemination and reduplication, to indicate distribution or iteration, is common (see § 58, 3, h;
§ 58, 4, a, d, f).
§ 54. Singular and. plural stems.
All verbs are determined as regards singularity or plurality of the
subject, less often of the object also; the singular form includes
reference to the dual. The most common method of indicating
plurality of the subject is by the use of the suffix -q a- (§ 31, 1, c); for
other suffixes indicating or implying plurality of subject or object, see
§ 31, 1, a and b; § 3 1 , 2 , a-d. Vocalic alternation of the final vowel of
the stem is also sometimes associated with change of number (see § 53,
1, b). The idea of distribution expressed by reduplication often passes
over into that of plurality of the subject or object (see § 58, 3).
Besides these formal methods of expressing number, there are
certain verb stems that are inherently limited in their reference to
number, the singular-dual of the intransitive subject or transitive
object being expressed by a stem which is etymologically distinctX Southern Paiute and Ute
242SAPIRfrom that for the plural of the intransitive subject or transitive object.
Certain of these stem contrasts are:
qari- one sits, dwells
avi- one lies
w'in i- one stands
pa(i)yione returns
pit<A- one arrives
pay(a)ione goes, walks
ap'iione sleeps

nu'a- to throw down several
(/si)-yway(a)i- to stick in several
(cf. wayi- above)
mimio'i(reduplicated) several
break off (irregularly related
to singular form)Several of these verb stems are also used as the second element
in compound verbs. T h e whole verb may be characterized as singular
or plural in this w a y ; a pluralizing -q a- may thus become unnecessary,
e. g. ivi- O N E D R I N K S : im-k a- S E V E R A L D R I N K , but ivi-ywin-'i- O N E
DRINKS S T A N D I N G : iviywaywi- S E V E R A L DRINK S T A N D I N G .
Singularity
or plurality of the object is not disturbed by composition, e. g.
paq a-rjw'in 'i- O N E STANDS AND K I L L S O N E ; paq a-rjwaywi- S E V E R A L

A small number of singular and plural verb stems are used only
as second elements in verb compounds, e. g.:

pat.caqwi- one is (or gets) wet
tuywi- fire goes outqatcvn avitci- several get tired out
patcaq winavitci- several get wet
tuywinavitci- fires go out§ 55. Verb syntax.
Under this head may be conveniently grouped a number of phenomena that affect the verb in relation to other words in the sentence.
( 1 ) SUBORDINATING ELEMENTS.
Subordinate clauses, denoting
cause, time, condition, concession, or attendant circumstance, are
extremely frequent in Paiute. Those of these clauses that are used
with logical subjects put them in the objective form. Thus, a
sentence like WHEN I CAME, YOU WERE AWAY is rendered WHEN ME
CAME, YOU WERE AWAY.
In all probability the objective is in these
cases to be interpreted genitivelv, the subordinating element as a
specialized postposition; e. g. AT MY COMING, YOU WERE AWAY.
This receives some support from the fact that a few of the ordinary
postpositions may be suffixed to verb forms (see 2 below). However,
of the verb-subordinating elements only -yu- (see c below), possibly
also -qu- (see e), is employed also with nouns (see § 50, 4, 49). The262X Southern Paiute and Ute
244SAPIRtense elements -pa·- (§ 32, 4) and -q-ai- (§ 32, 3) may precede the
subordinating suffix, but not the other tense elements. Five subordinating suffixes are found, the first three of which introduce
clauses referring to the subject of the main clause, the other two
clauses with a different subject.
(a) -tsi- gerund. Subordinates in -tsi- are here termed gerunds
because they have no expressed subject, though they may have an
object. Their logical subject is always the same as that of the main
clause. They indicate antecedent circumstance or activity and
are most appropriately translated in English by participial phrases:
HAVING — E D .
I t is at least possible that the gerund -i st.- is etymologically related to the animate noun suffix -tsi- (§ 24, 1, f); such a sentence
as HAVING so DONE, H E RETURNED would then originally have meant
THE ONE WHO DID so RETURNED.
Examples are:
maa'iisiyw imi'ywa'aiijiVA pa(i)yi'kiva'
find-gerund-him
(inv.) thouwith-him (inv.) return-hither-will; having found him with you, (he)
will come home
%nik mjum'its· min i's-'its mjwa'i-uikaijupiya'
after having so done
(plur.), having returned, (they) caused (it) to rain
iini'ts·, %ni'Tjuts• having so done, then (frequently used as sentence
connector); uniyutsiyiVA
then he (inv.)
rii' non-o'cC qwiya'tcitciqarfwdsI dream-present bear-becomegerund, I dream that I turned into a bear
Future gerunds in -va t-si-, -vipatsiBEING ABOUT TO—are also
very common and frequently found in idiomatic turns. Examples
are:
axa'ny-kava(sL7jwar)w a'l-kaVh o w - d o - p l u r a l - f u t u r e - g e r u n d - h i m (inv.)-ye say-plural-present? being about to do what with him say ye?

(b) -kai- W H E N , WHILE, AS; appears as spirantized -yai- or nasalized
-Tjqai-. This is a true subordinating suffix, attached to verb forms
whose subject is the same as that of the main verb. While -t si-Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE245forms denote antecedent activity, -kai- forms denote contemporaneity
of action. Examples are:

qa '(a)i pay(a)'it)ka
sings while walking
qAxqa! t-V p'iya' cua'yumLykadikwA
sat (iteratively) while eating it
(inv.) u p each time
-kai-c-u- (with enclitic -cu-; see § 19, 2, k) often implies immediate
sequence: AS SOON AS, e. g.:
a'iiaic-u άηα'ψΰαφι quna'manti wTqa'm'Mi'kaipiya'
say-as-just
coyote fire-at-being (obj.) covered; as soon as Coyote said so, (he)
covered some of (the) fire
Concessive clauses of the same subject as the main clause are
formed by appending -c-ampa- (§ 19, 2, j) to -kai-, e. g.:
iya'xaxayqaic ampa yA though fearing him (vis.), (he went to meet
him)
(c) -yu- WHEN, WHILE, AS. This subordinating suffix seems to
be identical in meaning with -kai- (see b above). I t is suffixed only
to stems or verb suffixes ending in -ai-. I t always replaces -kai- after
verb suffixes ending in -ai- (e. g. resultative subordinate -q-ai-yuWHEN SAYING, not *-q-ai-yai-).
After verb stems in -ai, -kai- is
used (e. g. ai-yai- WHILE SAYING), unless followed by enclitic -c-ampa-,
but not, e. g., -cu- (hence ai-yai-c u-, but ai-yu-c ampa-).
Examples
of -yu- clauses are:
niijwl'xaiyu' n'ni person-be-as-thou do! act like a person!
naijqa'q ai'yvq IVA when (he) heard it (inv.)
Clauses in -yu-cu-, analogous to those in -kai-c-u- and -ku-c-u-,
are found after verbal suffixes in -ai-, e. g.:
•Uni'k-aiyvc u un""i'k-upiya do-resultative-as-just fall-momentaneouspast; while so doing, (he) fell down
Concessive clauses in -yu-c ampa- replace forms in -kai-c ampaafter all verbs in -ai-, e. g.:X Southern Paiute and Ute246SAPIR

(d) -q a- WHEN - , IF. This subordinating suffix characterizes antecedent temporal and conditional clauses whose subject is different
from that of the main clause. Examples are:

geminated -qu-. This subordinating element also is used in clauses
whose subject is different from that of the main clause. Unlike -qaclauses (see c), however, -ku- subordinates generally indicate contemporaneity of action. Examples are:
vrpca' (u)xu qaiiit ϊηιναί' rain-when house-close-present; when (it)
rains, (he) shuts the door

"(2) V E R B A L USE OF POSTPOSITIONS. All postpositions indicating
movement, also some indicating presence, may be and frequently are
verbified without further change in form. Formal verbal suffixes (e. g.
momentaneous -yu- and tense elements) are directly suffixed to the
postposition. Examples of such verbified uses are:
au'mituywa'a
it-back-from-thou! go out (of it)!
U
'u'x-upa""p-'iya'
it (inv.)-through (-wpa-)-past; (he) went off
through it (inv.), in yonder direction

self-with-movement-inceptive-past-dual,
(they) 2 started to go along together
qa'tcu maa'n%T]wa'aik wA not that (vis.)-at-negative-it (inv.), was
not there
All postpositions may be participialized by means of -ft-"" (§ 25, 6,
a); e. g. -va nti-, obj. -va-nfia-, BEING AT ( - v a • - "" AT). Such participialized postpositions are often employed where simple local phrases or
adverbs would appear in English, e. g. H E GATHERED STICKS THATw
w
AT-BEING-OBJ. (uv a'ntiA) instead of simply THAT-AT, THERE (vv a"").
Sometimes the participial form takes on a specialized significance;
e. g. U'VIA IT-ON, THEREON, THEREAT, but umu'a!nt'i (obj. umwa'ntiA)
BEING THEREAT, i. e. SOME OF IT. Participialized postpositions may
be followed by other postpositions, e. g. -va nfi-m a-nayqwa- ATBEING-ON-FROM, AWAY FROM.",[236]

postpositions. Examples h a v e been found of verbal local subordinates

( 4 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF PARTICIPLES.
Participles are extremely in
evidence in Paiute. They are employed in a variety of syntactic
ways:
(a) Attributively, when they may often be translated as relative
clauses or as adjectives.
(b) Denominatively, e. g. to'ywant'i FIGHTING > FIGHTER, secondarily HAVASUPAI INDIAN; uvwa-'nt aRi THERE-BEING IT, THE THING
THAT IS THERE.(c) Adverbially, particularly with verbalized postpositional forms,
e. g. tümpwi'a-ij 'am-nÜA p\rn'ka ROCK-OBJ.- HE (VIS), IT-AT-BEINGOBJ. LOOK, i. e. HE LOOKS THERE AT THE ROCK rather than H E SEES THE

pronouns. Such participles may be considered as special cases of
predicative usages (d), the substantive verb being omitted. They
refer to general time as a rule. Examples are:

always say

( 5 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF ADJECTIVES.
Practically all adjectives are
properly verbal in form. As such, they may be predicatively employed, like any verb; or, in participial form, attributively or denominatively (e.g. ""'a't 'i tiyo'qwdci
GOOD-BEING RUNNING, GOOD
RUNNER). They may also be employed, in their bare stem-form,
as the first, rarely second, elements of noun compounds (see § 18, 1, d
and e).
A few adjectives are properly nominal in form, e. g. imaf'p'its·Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE249i-'tump'i
OLD. An independent adjective may be used
attributively to refer to an incorporated noun, e. g.:
SMALL;mia""p 'itsiA wana' Rup'iya' little-obj. net-make-past, made a little net
§ 56. Substantive verbs.
Substantive verbs are
formed from the demonstrative stems a- and u- by means of a verbalizing -ro'a-: am'α- το BE (vis.), uru'a- το BE (inv.). These forms may
be used with all nouns, animate or inanimate, and independent
pronouns. These simple forms are also used as the nucleus of a
set of substantive verbs of specific pronominal reference, composed
of the pronouns urjwa- HE, um-'C- THEY, and uru- IT, to which are
respectively appended (not phonetically suffixed) aro'a- for the visible,
uru'a- for the invisible, forms. I t is remarkable that the u- pronouns,
which are properly invisible, should be used in visible substantive
verbs as well, visibility and invisibility being expressed by the a- or uof the verb proper. The pronominal substantive verbs thus are:
( 1 ) FORMATIONurjw aro'a-OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.h e is (vis.)umw aro'a- they are (vis.)
ur aro'a- it is (vis.)uy uru'a-h e is (inv.)urn uru'a- they are (inv.)
ur uru'a- it is (inv.)These may be conveniently written as single words, e. g. uraro'aIT is (VIS.). The present tense of substantive verbs is designated
either by the normal -y'i- (§ 32, 1) or, more frequently, by the
absence of a tense suffix. The substantive verb may also take on
other tense suffixes, the modal -νϊ - (§ 33, 2), the usitative suffixes
(§ 30, 10 and 11), the participial -η-, and the nominal abstract
-na(§ 25, 3).
( 2 ) U S E OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.(a) In perhaps the majority of cases the substantive verb follows
and is phonetically disconnected from its predicate noun or subject;
an adverb, however, may precede and the predicate noun follow the
verb. In these cases the final vowel of the word preceding the
substantive verb is elided. Examples are:
cina'rjwav aru""a coyote it-is
''itc aro""ami' qa'tcu quna""ap-A this (inan.) be-usitative not firenegative, this (that we have been burning) is not fire

vruru""ai'
good-irrealis-past passive partic. it-is (inv.)present, it would be good
(b) A second method of employing substantive verbs is to attach
them to the preceding predicate noun or subject (noun or independent
pronoun), a glottal stop separating the a- or u- of the substantive
verb from the preceding final vowel, which is preserved; e. g. iici'
'aru'a- this (inan.) i s beside ''itc aru'a-. Perhaps such forms as iter'
'am'a- may be considered as verbs with incorporated nominal (or
pronominal) subject (§ 18, 2, f, t); e. g. Hci""aru'a~, cinaywavi'urywaro'a-.
Forms of this type are obligatory for independent pronouns of the
first and second persons. Examples are:
sari 'tcL dro'"" dog it-is
na'a'ints tsi' aru'"" little-girl it-is (absolute: na'a'intsits )

(c) The idea of B E I N G OF, B E L O N G I N G TO is normally expressed, as
illustrated above in several examples, by preceding the substantive
verb with an objective form of genitive significance, e. g.:
ni'niaru' aro' aro""anA me-interrogative is being, is it being of me?
is it my property?
n\'ni \waru"""" me he-is, he is mine
imi' 'uraru"" (aru""anA) thee it-is (being), it is yours
By a curious idiom, however, the logical owner is sometimes put
in the subjective, the thing owned in the objective, as though the
substantive verb were to be translated directly as ΤΟ OWN, e. g.:
itci'an aro""ai' this (inan.)-obj.-I be- present, this is mine, I own this

regularly employed in mythical narrative. Narrative referring to a
relatively recent past makes use of enclitic -ywa- (§ 19, 1, b). Without doubt -p 'iyai- is compounded of past passive participial -p'i(§ 25, 5, b) and verbalizing -yai- το HAVE (§ 26, 1, b). This is shown
partly by the fact that -p 'iyai- is treated analogously to -yai- (e. g.
participial -p 'iyanfi-, § 25, 6, e; negative -p 'i'ai-, § 57, 2, c), partly by
the fact that -p 'i- and -yai- may become disconnected (e. g. -ρ ϊ-a-yai-,
see 8 below, diminutive -p 'i-tsi-yai-). Hence a form like a'ip 'iya'
SAID istobeanalyzedasSAY-PAST PASSIVE PARTIC.-HAVE,HASSAID. In other words, Paiute -p-'iyai- forms are formally the synthetic
analogues of English perfects; the functions do not quite correspond
in the two languages, however.

sort, compounded of narrative past -p 'iyai-, impersonal -t ua-, and
present -yi-, have been already referred to (§ 29, 14). What difference
there is between the -p 'iyai- and the -p 'iayai- forms with possessive
-a- (§ 24, 2, a) is not clear. As for the use of the present -y'i-, it is
very likely that the -yai- of -p 'iyai-, when final, is to be understood asX Southern Paiute and Ute
168SAPIRincluding a reference to present time (cf. lack of -y'i- after -yai- το
h a v e , § 26, 1, b, which implicitly refers to present time) and that this
implied -y'i- needs to be expressed after an inserted -t-mo-. In other
words, -yai- and -yai-y'i- have fallen together to -yai-, but -yait uay'iremains as such. Examples are:

§ 33. Modal suffixes.
There are only two specifically modal verb suffixes. Most modal
ideas, as we have seen, are expressed by the aid of enclitics (§ 19, 2).
The indicative has no special modal suffix; for the imperative, see §
52. For perfective -qai- as inferential, see § 32, 3.
(1) -yv-, (-qv-,) -T)qv- irrealis. This element indicates that the
activity expressed by the verb is unreal, i. e. either merely potential
or contrary to fact (potential in past time). In the latter case it is
preceded by perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3) or narrative past -p 'iyai- (§
32, 6). I t is not used with present -yi- nor, it would seem, with future
-va·-71, -mpa-n.
Optative examples (WOULD THAT . . . . ! ) involving
enclitic -γα' followed by 'oai' have been already given (§ 19, 2, b).
Further examples of the irrealis are:

(5) ai-, mai-. These are extended forms of demonstrative a- and
ma-. They are used as independent inanimate demonstrative pronouns, particularly with verbs of saying, (talking, hearing). However,
they are not ordinarily found except followed by pronominal enclitics.
Their objective forms are aia·, maia- (probably < a-ya-, ma-ya-).
As to usage, ai- is best translated as t h a t (indefinite), mai- as t h a t
(quoted, referred to).
Examples of subjective ai- are:
a'inl nayqa'q aip ini that-my heard (partic.)-my, that (is) what I
heard
a'i(y)aq-A qu'qo'qwikanayum aRi that-it (vis.) shoot (distributively)plural-verbal noun-your (plur.) it (vis.), that (is) it which you
(plur.) shoot at
Examples of objective aia- are:
a'ian 'a'imi
that (obj.)-I say- usitative, that's what I always say
a'ia y (fir 'a'imi' that (obj.)-he (vis.) indeed say-usitative, that's
what he indeed always says
'a'i 'iy'ir 'aik^A that (obj.)-thou indeed said, that indeed you said
(for 'ai < 'aia', see § 40, 2)
Curiously enough, objective aia- becomes ai- before the interrogative, the two elements combining as aitcu'a-, aintcu'a-, e. g.:
a'itcnan (or a'infcuan) a'ik ?A that (obj.)-interrogative-I said, did
I say that?
a'intcua r) 'a'imi' that (obj.)-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is
he wont to say that? does he really mean that?
Subjective mai- is illustrated in:
ma'in n\ni nar/qa'qaip'ini that (quoted)-my me heard (partic.)-my,
that's what I heard
mai'm imi nayqa'q ainA that-thy thee hearing, that's what you hear
Examples of objective maia- are:
ma'ian 'aik *A that I say
ma'i(y) 'iy'ir 'a'ik -Λ that indeed thou sayest (mai < maia' as above)
Parallel to maia- is m""a'ia-, e. g.:Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language

u w
m a'iAcampan niruyw ampa'xA that -(obj.)-only-me I-to talk, that
only talk to me! stop talking to me!
As we have already seen, aia- is also used as inanimate visible
objective article-pronoun: 'α'ΪΑ (§ 42, 7). Its parallel invisible 'oa'iA
(probably < u-a-ya-) is not used as independent demonstrative,
though it must be such in origin. For adverbial-connective use of
ai-, see § 60, 2, a; for 'οα'ΪΑ as modal adverb, see § 60, 3.
(6) VERBS OF SAYING. Parallel to the demonstratives ai- and radiäre the verbs of saying: ai- το SAY (indefinitely) and mai- (mwa'ia-)

TO SAY THAT (which has been quoted); e. g. qatc m a' iar/wai' yucampA
NOT SAY-THAT-NEGATIVE-SUBORDINATING-ONLY,ALTHOUGH NOT SAY-ING THAT. Either these verbs result from composition with demonstrative α-, ma- (m w a'-); or they are merely verbified forms of demonstrative ai- and mat-.
Note on § § 39-43.
The three classes of pronouns already discussed observe the distinction in the third person between visible (or present) and invisible
(or absent) forms. Nevertheless sentences occur, as may have been
noticed, in which the same person or object is designated now as
visible, now as invisible. To a large extent this seems to be due to a
desire to prevent the same phonetic group (""word"") from containing
both a visible and an invisible element (see, for combinations of
two enclitics, § 41, 1, e), but not entirely. Apparently the difference
between the two sets of forms tends to become a formal rather than
a strictly functional matter. Examples of such contradictory
sentences are:
imi'ntcu'a-ijA pini'Rai'iijWA
tiyi'vw'ia'm u'IJWA thou-interrogativehim (vis.) see-him (inv.) friend-obj.-thy he (inv.; = him), did you

Interrogative stems may he divided into two groups, those employed
denominatively (interrogative pronouns proper) and those employedX Southern Paiute and Ute

accompanied by the interrogative enclitic -ru'a- (§ 19, 2, f).
( 1 ) D E N O M I N A T I V E FORMS.
Four or five denominative stems are
found: aya-, ini-, impi-, and αηια-; further ay a-, which is always
verbalized or adverbialized by suffixed elements.
(a) arja- WHO? This interrogative refers to persons only. Its
objective form is ayaia-; its subjective plural is ayami- (see § 48, 1),
objective ayam'ia-. I t must not be confused with αηα- H E , THAT
ONE (§ 39). I t is perhaps to avoid this confusion that interrogative
aya- is apparently never used with postpositions; e. g. aya'ruxwA
denotes το HIM, not το WHOM?. The latter idea would have to be
expressed periphrastically (see § 50, 8). Examples of αηα- are:ay aru""a who is? who is it?
ay aro""avi iyA who would-be this-one? I wonder who this is!
'ay an i'lc -A who does-so? who is it that does so?

aya'm'iantca' pAxqa'yu whom (plur.)- preterit-thou kill? whom (2)
did you kill?
(b) in i-' WHO? WHAT? OF WHAT SORT? This is a generalized
animate interrogative pronoun, referring to an animal, an animate
being not known to be definitely human or animal, or a person of
undefined characteristics. Subjective in-i- sometimes appears as
unelided ini before aro'a- το BE. Its objective singular is inia-·,
subjective plural in iyw'i- (see § 48, 1), objective iniyw'ia-.

of imp'i- are:

butcher with?
imp'i'xai' what hast thou?
impu'ruyiarjA
what is he making?
(d) ania- WHAT? This interrogative is used only as the object
of verbs of saying or mental activity, e. g.:
'ani'an 'aik -Λ what-I say? what did I say?
im αη ιΑ nan o'c ivätcf thou what being-wont-to-dream? what have
you ever dreamt?
ani'a' cy.via 'i' what-thou think-present? what are you thinking of?
Aside from its use as an interrogative pronoun, an ia- frequently
appears as a verb, ΤΟ SAY WHAT? AS such it is treated analogously to
ai- TO SAY. Examples are:
im 'ani'avatci thou wont-to-say-what? what are you accustomed to
say?
an i Axqa r)A what did he (vis.) say? (for -qa- see § 32, 2)

its own or the following word. Examples of the former have been
already given; see also -cuya-ywa-noa(h below). When combined

The following sketch of Southern Paiute, which was completed in
December, 1917, is offered as a contribution to the scientific study of
the Shoshonean languages. Whether or not it proves to be fairly
typical of the whole group in phonologic and morphologic respects
must be left to future research.
My first field acquaintance with Shoshonean linguistics was gained
in a short trip during August and September of 1909 among the
Northern Utes of Uintah Reserve, Utah. This trip was undertaken,
with the collaboration of Dr. J. A. Mason, under the auspices of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. A number of Ute texts
were secured, supplemented by considerable grammatical information.
To extend and deepen the insight into Plateau Shoshonean linguistics
then obtained it seemed advisable, indeed necessary, to undertake
further researches. Hence arrangements were made by the late
Dr. G. B. Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania, with the authorities of the Indian school at Carlisle
to have one of their Paiute students, Tony Tillohash, put a t my
disposal for the ethnologic and linguistic study of his tribe. I worked
with Tony, who proved to be an excellent informant, in Philadelphia
from February to May of 1910. A series of texts, much supplementary grammatical material, a large number of songs, and considerable ethnological information were obtained. The Paiute
linguistic data proved so much superior to the Ute which I had
previously secured that I have decided in this sketch to limit myself
to the former. Moreover, there is enough phonetic, lexical, and
morphologic difference between Ute and Southern Paiute to render
the attempt to describe both at the same time confusing. I hope to
publish a briefer sketch of the Ute language at some future date.
The present volume is to be followed by a series of Southern Paiute
and Ute texts and by a Southern Paiute vocabulary. I t is a great
pleasure to recall the unflagging patience and helpfulness of Tony
Tillohash and the kindness with which Dr. Gordon did all that lay
in his power to make these studies possible. My thanks are due Miss
Jane McHugh, the Secretary and at that time Acting Director of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and the authorities of the
Museum for permission to have these Paiute studies published by theX Southern Paiute and Ute

190SAPIRIndependent and enclitic pronouns are often combined into a single
phonetic group or 'Svord,"" the independent or enclitic element being
either subjective or objective. Thus, instead of saying i'mi pAxqa'yumpa n ia r/A t h o u k i l l - w i l l - h i m , one can attach objective -αηΛ
to imi-: ϊτηί'αηΛ pA'qa'yumpani'
t h o u - h i m k i l l - w i l l . The following types of combination occur:
(a) Independent subject + enclitic object, e. g.:

A variant of this type is that in which the independent and enclitic
pronouns are both subjective, the independent pronoun being used
predicatively, e. g.:

(vis.) me ( = my) whom-depending-on-perfective-verbal nounlike-my, it is not you on whom I have been depending (for use of
"" i t "" as equivalent of substantive verb, see § 56, 3)
(b) Independent object (possessive) +enclitic subject, e. g.:ηϊ'ηϊα' pn)wa'niv""a n-iani me-thou wife-make-will-me, you will marry

A special variety of this type is that in which the independent
objective functions as the subject of a subordinate clause, the enclitic
subject as the subject of the main clause, e. g.:
rii'niantca ijA tTqa'xuni yaya'x-A me-preterit-he eat-while-me cry
(momentaneously); while I was eating, he began to cry (-ntca'ijA is

(c) Independent object + enclitic object. The first object may be
the subject of a subordinate clause, the second its object, e. g.:

192SAPIR§ 41. Combinations of enclitic pronouns.
Enclitic pronouns are often combined, the union of two such pronouns being extremely common, that of three not at all rare. The
order of elements is rigidly determined by form, not by function (e. g.
-atjani- HE-ME, I-HIM, I-HIS, HIS-ME, MY-HIM, HE-MY). The resulting
theoretical ambiguities are generally resolved by the context, particularly as the pleonastic usages already referred to (§ 40, 5) give
opportunity for further limitation of the syntactical possibilities.
Thus, rii' -ayanl can only mean I-HIM or I-HIS; -aijani -ni (verb form)
can hardly mean anything but HE-ME. The following table gives a
survey of combinations of two enclitic pronouns; the horizontal entries
are subjective, the vertical objective. As a rule the pronominal elements are preserved intact, but certain modifications need to be
noted.
The combined forms listed in the table apply not only to combinations of subject and object of the same verb but to all other combinations of subjective and objective, including possessive, forms. The
table also includes combinations of objective + objective enclitics,
insofar as objective forms are identical with subjective forms; e. g.
-ιaija'ami- HE-THEE, HE-THY applies also to HIM-THEE, HIM-THY, HISTHEE. Special double objective forms are:
-'mini- thee-me, me-thee
-Tjumini- you (obj.)-me, me-you (obj.)
-miriimu'i- thee-us (also us-thee, we-thee)
-rjuminimwi- you (obj.)-us (also us-you, we-you)
(1) MORPHOLOGY OF COMBINED FORMS. The following rules are
followed in the combination of enclitic pronouns:
(a) The combination of the first person singular subject and the
second person object, which should theoretically result in -miniand -Tjumini-, is simplified to - mi- and -tjumi- (properly THEE and
YOU OBJ.), the first person being thus merely implied.
(b) The second person singular subjective element (-') always
follows an element of the first or third person, also the objective form
of the second person.
(c) In all combinations of the first and second persons but those
coming under (b), the second personal element precedes (e. g. -rjw'iniYE-ME, -miniTHEE-ME).
(d) In combinations of the third person with either the first or
second person, the element referring to the third person precedes.
Note, however, -τμνϊ'ϊηιϊ- YE-THEM (INV.).","[207, 208, 209, 210]"
"Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE149Among the ideas expressed by aspect suffixes, those of momentaneousness and durativeness are the most important. Every verb
has a durative and a momentaneous form, the former being generally
the primary form of the verb, the latter expressed by internal consonant gemination, glottalization, reduplication, the suffixing of
certain elements, or a combination of these. The durative, as its
name implies, expresses continuous action, action conceived of as
lasting for an appreciable length of time (e. g. ΤΟ DRINK) ; the momentaneous conceives of the action as taking but a moment of time (e. g.
ΤΟ TAKE A DRINK) . Following are a few preliminary examples of the
distinction:
DURATIVEqova'qwi- to break
naya'va- to seem
mantcu'ywi-nato crush
yaya'- to cry
im!- to drink
qwatea'-ya- to splash about
iiyai- to take place
nontsi'- to
flyMOMENTANEOUSqo'po'qwinaya!p a -yurnantcu'q wi-n'nayaya'yato burst into tears
im'-jjuqwA'tca'-q i- to splash (once)
tTqa'rj'winontsi'-k-u-The various methods of forming the momentaneous exemplified
above are to be considered as more or less equivalent. No simple
rules can be given for all cases. One simply has to learn, e. g., that
such a form as *yaya'quplya* is not in use, but that yaya'xAp'iya
must be employed.
The aspects that may be recognized in Paiute are the durative,
the momentaneous, the inceptive, the iterative, the durative-iterative,
the resultative, the usitative, and the continuative. Moreover,
ideas that belong to the category of aspect are sometimes expressed
by means of compounded verb-stems or suffixes of motion (e. g. the
cessative by -maupa-, § 18, 2, a; the continuative or durative by
-qar'i- ΤΟ SIT, -q wa'ai- ΤΟ GO OFF, § 28, 2). A careful study of the
nuances of aspect formation can hardly be given here. We shall
simply list the various aspect suffixes with examples. For momentaneous (and inceptive) verbs formed by gemination or glottalization,
see § 53, 2; by reduplication, § 58, 5. For iteratives formed by reduplication, with or without accompanying gemination, glottalization,
or both, see § 58, 4.
(1) -ya-g durative of active intransitive (mediopassive) verbs.
By a mediopassive verb is meant one that expresses action withoutX Southern Paiute and Ute
150SAPIRdefinite agency, e. g. τ ο SHAKE (intr.), as contrasted with transitive
τ ο SHAKE and passive τ ο BE SHAKEN. Sometimes -ya- seems to be
used also with agentive active verbs. Examples of durative -ya- are:
riintci'yai
(it) shakes
piyo'xwai' (he) drags (it);
piyo'x Aqip'iya'aiywA
dragging (it)
yiu'xwai'
moves around
yu'mu'x(w)Ap'iya'
(he) moved
qwimpu'xwai'
(it) wiggles
si'yu'xwai'
slideshe came homeT h e momentaneous correlate of -ya- is -qi- (see 3 below).
T h e element -ya-g is very commonly employed in durative verbs
expressing a continuous sound of some sort, e. g.:
ampa'yato talk
po 'yux Apiyain i there was a sound as of something going through
(his) flesh (for -n ia- in these and other -ya- verbs, see § 19, 2, d).
fiijwa'vaya- to make a noise
ki 'yuxwa(i)yin i makes a noise like rattling coins
pa 'raxa(i)ym i (rain) patters
qu'pa'raxato pop in burning
po 'n'noxwa{i)yin i sounds like drumming
no 'ruxwa{i)yin-C
sounds like a heavy object being dragged on a
smooth level surface
•pi'T)kixa(i)ytn i sounds like dripping water
si·' yaxani'iylni
makes a rustling noise (for -n i'i-, see 12 below)
T h e momentaneous correlate of this -ya- also is -q i- (or -rjqi-).
(2) -γΐ-, (-ijqi-) durative-iterative, chiefly of active intransitive,
sometimes transitive, verbs. I t is often transitivized by means of
-yfi- (§ 29, 10). I t differs from -ya- in conceiving of the action as not
strictly continuous, but broken up into a rapid series. I t differs from
the normal iterative (expressed by reduplication) in t h a t the repeated
acts cohere into a single durative unit. Examples are:
tarfwi'tciyc
keeps time by tapping with (his) foot
mavi'tSLji
claps hands
qinip uxwC ' (mouse) gnaws
ίΑ'ρϊ'η'αηα'χιηφί'

ovwo'qway(c)i'

Sound-verbs indicating a continuous series of sounds of like nature
may also have the -yi- suffix, e. g.:

to make a noise on the rasp
barksw'a'tciyiijupiya'(he) w h o o p e dA few such verbs have -ΐ)φ- instead of -yi-, e. g.:

ki{y)i'r}qiV(he) pants
(mouse, rat) makes a peeping noise
laughs(3) - q i - momentaneous, chiefly of active intransitive and mediopassive verbs. Transitive forms in -q i-ηφ-.
Morphologically, -qiis the regular momentaneous correspondent of -yi-, formed from it by
gemination (§ 53, 2 b); it contrasts with both -ya- and -yi- forms.
Examples of its use are:
tA'pi'tcAqiTjqi'qwAto crush it by stepping on (it)
(one thing) break(s) off
tarii'ntciqii]qip'iyai{y)aq
A (he) shook it by trampling once with (his)

iu'pa'q
ipiya
(one) pulled out (intrans.), emerged
to'pa'q i

si'yu'q
wi
to slide, slip
mina'qiMidway between properly momentaneous forms in -qi- and
durative forms in -ya- or -yi- are certain verbs in -q i- with nonmomentaneous form of stem, i. e. with ungeminated consonant.
These may be termed durative-momentaneous. Examples of durative-momentaneous versus momentaneous forms are:
qovo'q-WL-to break (intr.): qo'po'q wi- to break instantaneously
paya'q (a)i- to tear slowly (but in one tear): pA'qa'q i- to tearX Southern Paiute and Ute
152SAPIRIn such verbs -q-i- does not seem to alternate with -ya- and -yi-.
Verbs indicating a momentaneous sound also have a -q-i- suffix, e. g.:
kiffca'q in i
(it) makes a sound as of when something is thrust
through paper
sa'mu'qwiyini
makes a deep noise as when a stone is thrown into a
well
qi 'k in-L (it) sounds like one tear of a rag
v'cu'q-WL whistles
(4) -n a- durative transitive with singular object: -n'na- momentaneous transitive with singular object. See § 31, 2, b and c.
(5) -yu- n momentaneous. This is by far the most common momentaneous suffix. It follows most verb stems and is also employed
after many derivative and verbalizing suffixes. Examples are:
im- to drink
maain-i- to touch (duratively)
qvni- to take (one object)
maa-'vi'a- to be dressed
07iqa-' to be red
pa(i)yi- to return

tspiyup'Lya
came out, (suddenly) appeared
a'ir/up'iya% spoke outIn particular cases -rju- n may take on an inceptive or cessative
significance, but its true force is never intrinsically inceptive or
cessative. Examples of these developments of the primary momentaneous idea are:
(a) toyoq-wi- to run
yaiyuii- to carry
m - to drinkcv-'yu-c-u-(to be) onetoyo'qwnjui'

momentaneous (or inceptive) activity that is just about to take
place (cf. the use of momentaneous forms in Russian to indicate the
future). The idea of imminent activity is still more explicitly
rendered by -quntsi-, compounded of -tju-n and diminutive -(ri)tsi(§ 35, 2). Thus, a form like trqa'quntsi- EAT-MOMENTANEOUS (INCEPTIVE)-LITTLE,TO B EA LITTLEOFF FROM BEGINNING TOEAT,easily comes to mean το BE ABOUT TO EAT. Examples of pre-inceptive
-r/untsi- are:

ya'uqwirjunUik-A

A'pi'iTfunts komi I am about to fall asleep, I am sleepy
(6) -ij'wi- momentaneous (intransitive). This suffix, which may
be related to -yu-n, occurs only in two or three verbs, its durative
correlative being a rarely occurring -i- or, in one case, -q a-. These
verbs are:
DURATIVEttyai- to take place
piyaito be left over
cuwaqato breatheMOMENTANEOUSt'i'qaij'wipiyay'wicuwarfwi-to take a long breath(7) -qu-, -jumomentaneous; inceptive. This element, like
-τμι-η, seems to be primarily momentaneous in significance and in a
number of verbs is used instead of -iju-"". Some verbs have both
-iju-"" and -q u- forms, generally with some idiomatic difference of
meaning. In many cases, moreover, -q u- is a properly inceptive
element, as in durative-inceptive -ya-q u-. What nuance of meaning
differentiates -q u- and -q u- is not clear. Presumably -q u- is more
definitely momentaneous in character (see § 53, 2, a, 3); as inceptive
it probably indicates a sharp moment of beginning.
Examples of momentaneous -q u- are:

USED τ ο HUNT.
I t is not obvious what difference in meaning, if any,
there is between usitative participles in -vatci- (§ 25, 6, c) and -m intt-.
Curiously enough, participles in -ti- may also be made usitative by
suffixed -m ia-, e. g.:
quna'q axantimfaq-WA
it as firefire-plural-having-usitative-it,those who have(11) -η ·ϊ- η usitative, used only before past passive participle
-p i- (§ 25, 5, b) and its temporal derivative -p iyai- (§ 32, 6). Contrary
to phonetic rule, not -n 'ipKyai)- results, but -n 'impi(yai)-.
Examples of usitative passive participial -η ϊηιρϊ- are:
p'ini'nu'iriimpiA
(things) always seen about (obj.)
main'Lyunirnpiqwani
my always saying it (song form)
The common use of -η ϊιη,ρϊ- as a means of forming instrumental
nouns has been already discussed (§ 25, 2).
Examples of -n 'imp'iyai-, the usitative form of the narrative past,
are:

I t may be pointed
out, however, t h a t -nimp'iyai- does not seem to occur after momentaneous -7/W-, which requires a following -m-i-. This may imply that the
-7U-"" usitative tends to have a more strictly durative character than
-m i-"", which in turn may have a momentaneous -iterative color.
(12) -n'ni-' (-ni'i-') continuative. This is a common durative
suffix that, with verbs of movement, shades into a significance not
very different from that of -m'mia- (§ 28, 4). I t seems best defined
as a continuative, equivalent in meaning to such English locutions as
το k e e p -ING, το be -Ing. It refers to an act consummated at one
period, not, like the usitative, to one which is repeated at intervals.
Examples are:

Another form of this suffix is -n i·-"" or, with preceding glottal stop,
-' . . .n-i·-'. These elements seem to differ from the more common
-n'ni-, partly in reinforcing the idea of plurality or distribution of
the subject, partly in conveying a usitative implication. The matter
is not altogether clear, however. Examples are:

Most of the enclitic
pronouns may be used either subjectively or objectively. The
objective forms of the second person are formed from the corresponding subjective forms by the addition of -m i-, perhaps identical with
the -m i - of independent m i - T H O U ; - y n m i - < -Tjw'imi(§ 3, 3, d).
The dual animate enclitic -' . . . m i - is a subjective element; it is
outwardly identical with
. . .m i.'-, the third person plural animate
invisible element, but, though in certain cases very difficult to keep
apart from the latter (which, when the verb is singular in form,
necessarily has a dual reference), is clearly distinct from it, as it may
refer to all animate persons, including the third person animate
visible. -®i- is only used in a possessive sense and is evidently somewhat in a class by itself. The position of the pronominal enclitics
with reference to other enclitic elements has been already spoken of
(see § 19, 4).
The enclitic pronouns are closely related, for the greater part, to
the corresponding independent pronouns. The first person singular
-ni- is connected with, though not identical with, the independent
rii', ni-; this vocalic alternation is probably an old Uto-Aztekan
feature, cf. Nahuatl independent ni I with proclitic ni- I, ME. The
other enclitics of the first person are identical with the corresponding
independent pronouns, t- becoming spirantized to -r- (-tc- after -i-).
The -' of the second person singular is entirely peculiar to the enclitic series; - ψ ν ϊ - and - r j u m i - of the plural are doubtless spirantized
from *m'i{m i ) - , cf. independent m 'im i-.
The visible forms of the
third person are compounded of demonstrative -a- and the pronominal
elements -rja-, -m 'i-, and -q a- already discussed in § 39, 1. The
invisible forms are compounded of an accessory -'- and the same pronominal elements, a -w- being inserted in the animate singular and
wwX Southern Paiute and Ute184SAPIRthe inanimate. This
. . . -w- may be a specialized form of
demonstrative "" ' « ' - THAT (invisible). T h e reflexive possessive -v'iseems to have no independent analogue, unless, indeed, it be connected
with relative pi- (§ 45); cf. probably also Shoshonean *pi- HE, HIS
(Cahuilla pe HE, pehe- HIS; San Juan Capistrano po- HIS).
(2) USE OF SUBJECTIVE FORMS. The subjective enclitics may be
used as the subject of a non-subordinate verb or as the object of an
imperative (§ 52).
The animate dual -' . . .πιϊ-, however, of
which examples will be given separately, functions only as a subject,
sometimes also as a possessive. Subjective examples of enclitic
pronouns, attached both to verbs and to other parts of speech, are:

peculiar contraction phenomena are to be noted. Ordinarily the
pronominal -' does not amalgamate with a ' in the last syllable of the
word to which it is attached (e. g. from -ywa'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO
is formed ηα'υ,'ψναίχινα'αί''
GO THOU AND HANG THYSELF!), but inSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE185other cases such amalgamation takes place, so that no specific pronominal element is apparent at all. This is notably the case with
interrogative -ru'a-, e. g.:
im'yiro'"" art thou drinking? ( < -ro'a- + -'; not -ro'a')
cu(w)a'ru' nyn o'c C maybe you'll dream
Probably this difference of treatment has something to do with the
difference between inherent and accessory ' (§ 15, 1). Furthermore,
the pronominal
is lost in certain cases, notably after qatcu- NOT,
after demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5), and before ai- τ ο SAY and ani- τ ο
DO; a final -a is then elided before following a-. Examples are:
qatcu' n a 'n ia'ap-A not-thou say-negative, do not say anything

The third person inanimate enclitic pronouns (-aqa- and -' . . .q wa-)
are very often used, as in English, in an impersonal sense, particularly
in references to the weather. Examples are:
u7)wa'(i)y'iaq A it is raining (said by one who sees it raining)

it is raining (said by one who does not see it rain)

(3) USE OF OBJECTIVE FORMS. Objective forms are used as objects
of transitive verbs, as subjects of subordinate verbs, and as possessives.
For their use in subordinate verb forms, see § 55, 1. Possessives,
exemplified only in noun forms, are treated below (4). Examples
of enclitic pronouns in a properly objective sense are:

with nouns. Inasmuch, however, as such an enclitic, even when
appended to a noun, can have objective (or, in most cases, also subjective) significance, a theoretical ambiguity sometimes results. Thus,
a form like qam'anl HOUSE-OBJ.-I (or ME, MY) may be interpreted
as signifying either MY HOUSE (obj.) or I (DO so AND so το) A HOUSE.
The form of the whole sentence or the context generally removes
the ambiguity. In practice a noun with possessive enclitic is generally
followed by a postnominal article-pronoun, e. g. qani'an am MYHOUSE (OBJ.) IT, in which case no ambiguity is possible. Examples
of possessive enclitics are:
purjqu'm my horse; qu'tcu'mpuyquTjwini my cattle (lit., buffalo-pets)
dci'nipA'tca'n-cc'RI to*to'q wa'ar/q'ithis-me mocasin-myitpatch(distributively)- for, patch these moccasins of mine for me

pia'ru'a'm aro""a mother-interrogative- thy is, is it your mother?
pi(y)a'YUM

taya'n a x ituywa yA knee-in-to-his (vis.), into his knee
paml'vqWA his (inv.) elder brother
aru""ana'yiVA be-verbal noun-his (inv.), his being, his property
ari'c υ taywa 'q• am that (inan.) tooth-its (vis.) it, that tooth of it
yaya 'ma q-A end-at-its, at its end
A'SI'a-(i)ya'Q WA its surface, bark (obj.)
nia 'viy'wa m,· aijA chief-possessed-their (vis.) he, their chief
pi{y)a""am'i their (inv.) mother
Instead of -am'i- THEIR (vis.) and -' . . .m i- THEIR (inv.) are
sometimes found the corresponding singular forms -αηα-, -' . . .rjwa-.
This takes place, though not always, when the person referred to by
the enclitic pronoun precedes with the plural animate suffix -ψνϊ(-TO I-; § 48,1), evidently in order to avoid a double plural. Analogous
phenomena will meet us again (§ 41, 1, e; § 42, 2 and 5). Examples of
this ""number dissimilation"" in possessive forms are:
qum a'rjwia m,· αηΑ ma 'ai>LTjWAhusband-plural-objective-theirhe( = them; § 42, 2, end) chief-his (inv.; = their inv.); their-husbands206X Southern Paiute and Ute

objectives see § 49,2; for pleonastic use of possessive pronoun,
below)
""'a't iywayw'ia'aywA good-possessed-plural-obj.-his (inv.), their (inv.)
good ones (anim. obj.), good ones (anim. obj.)
The reflexive possessive -vi- occurs only in objective forms, i. e.
after objective -a-, -ya- (§ 49, 1); after nominalizing -n a- (§ 25, 3); and
after postpositions, which are syntactically equivalent to the objective (§ 50, 3). The reflexive possessive indicates t h a t the possessor is
the same person as the subject of the sentence. Ordinarily it refers
to the third person, but it may also be employed in first and second
personal references. Examples <)f its use are:
qaiu 'u'r<i paa'iav utjWA house (obj.) it-towards aunt-obj.- own she

in t h a t same little cave of mine
Explicitly plural (or dual) forms of the third person reflexive possessive are also found; they are compounded of -am 'i- THEIR (vis.)
or -' . . .m 'i- THEIR (inv.) and -®ϊ-, theoretical
. . .m 'ivi- appearing,
however, as
. . .movi-, - . . .m-auv'i-. Examples are:
qaTu'va ntuxwa ami^i

puyqu'tsia mi^i their (2) own dear horse (obj.)
ροτο'ιη'αηιαιιφϊ, -ιηοφϊ with their (2) own canes (cf. pars'>ηα(υ)φϊ

with their own canes
(for -q a- see § 48, 2)
Explicitly dual forms of the reflexive possessive are made bySouthern Paiute, a Shoshonean207LanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE189compounding -vi- with animate dual -' . . . M V : -νϊ'ϊτηϊ- THEIR 2
OWN. This form, as contrasted with -' . . .ηι ουϊ- discussed above,
shows clearly t h a t third person animate plural invisible
. . .m 'iis not identical with animate dual
. . .m-ϊ-, though it seems sometimes to intercross it in usage. Examples of -νϊ'ϊιη ϊ- are:
naw'<t>itsii)wamiyu' a'plyai.i'qa'mitu'cu'naijApi(y)a'(i)yavi'imitwo-brothers they carried-it (vis.)-dual grinding-her mother-obj.own-dual; the two brothers carried w h a t she, their (2) mother,

(2) mother's house
(5) PLEONASTIC FORMS.
Double (or even more frequent)
expression of pronominal elements is very common in Paiute. Examples of the repetition of the subjective or objective pronoun, both
pronouns enclitic or one enclitic and the other independent, have
occurred in preceding lists. There is a marked tendency for the
objective enclitic pronoun to attach itself to the verb even if it is
elsewhere expressed in the sentence; in transitive sentences the
enclitic subject seems to be normally attached to the verb only in
combination with the enclitic object (§ 41, 2, a). Particularly characteristic is the employment of enclitic possessives together with
genitives (i. e. objectives) of the corresponding independent pronoun, e. g.:
n'i'mA pavi'lsinime my-elder brothermaya'iA ραα'ατ/Λ h i m h i s - a u n tpi 'xäSiTj'w'im imi'A pigs-thy thee, thy pigs
imi'A paa'i'ami thee aunt-obj.-thy, thy aunt (obj.)
Pleonasm is abundantly illustrated also in nouns, which are often
anticipated or redundantly referred to by pronouns, independent or
enclitic. Of such usages also examples have already been given.
Particularly frequent is the occurrence of an objective enclitic pronoun
of the third person with an objective noun, e. g. ι SEE-IT HOUSE (OBJ.)
as equivalent of ι SEE HOUSE (OBJ.). In genitive constructions this
is almost the rule, e. g. ραα'ία η.ι qaniar/A AUNT-OBJ.-HIS HOUSE-HER,
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE; also paa'iarjA
qanl.

"Southern Paiute DictionaryPREFACE.
The following dictionary of Southern Paiute is based on the Paiute
texts which form the second part of this volume and on the grammatical and lexical notes which were secured from Tony Tillohash at
the same time as the texts. I t is in no sense a complete dictionary
of the language but necessarily includes only such material as I
happened to record. The entries and the examples which follow
must always be understood in the light of a knowledge of the fundamental Paiute sounds and their changes. In other words, the
dictionary presupposes Part I, for it would be impracticable to give
chapter and verse for each phonetic rule that is illustrated in the
examples.
The purpose of the dictionary is twofold: to assist the student in
the analysis of the texts; and to provide the future student of comparative Shoshonean with the lexical materials that he will need.
No attempt has been made to heap examples, which in most instances
would add nothing that is not already evident from the entries
themselves and the phonology and morphology of Paiute as described
in Part I. On the other hand, distinctive derivatives of stems and
compounds are given where available. Cross-references to the texts,
indicated by page and line numbers, are given sparingly and with
attention to their value for the student.
The dictionary includes all noun and verb (including adjective)
stems, pronouns, adverbs, and interjections recorded. Of the elements
which cannot occur unless preceded or followed by other elements it
includes noun and verb stems which occur only as second elements in
compounds, enclitics (including pronominal enclitics), postpositions, and
prefixes. I t does not include as independent entries the derivational
and relational suffixes described and illustrated in the grammar.
If an entry, such as an enclitic or postposition, is treated in the
grammar, it is merely listed without examples and with the appropriate reference to Part I.
EDWARD SAPIR.","[559, 560, 561, 562, 563]"
"117. A Hopi Indian.
118. This is a much more complete account of the mourning ceremony
than that given by Kelly (1964) and by Sapir (1912c).
119. This is true also of the mourning songs sung by Havasupai and
Walapai.
120. Probably among the Mojave or other lower Colorado River
Yumans.
121. This figure is undoubtedly exaggerated; Kaibab Paiutes never
had that many horses to sacrifice.
122. Shivwits Paiute.
123. Kelly (1964: 85) illustrates such a rattle made by Tillohash for
Sapir in 1910.
124. Usually referred to as Captain Pete.
125. In Arizona east of the present Kaibab Paiute Reservation.
126. Skutumpah Ranch is near the head of Johnson Canyon northeast
of Kanab.
127. The meaning of this sentence is obscure. It may mean that the
mountain sheep group was formed of others who were neither ""coyotes""
nor ""birds""; or it may mean that there were other unaffiliated groups
of singers present.
128. There are no Southern Paiute drums among the ethnographic
specimens collected by Powell in the 1870s (Fowler and Matley 1979:
72). Kelly (1964: 85) lists as musical instruments only the Cry Dance
rattle and the Bear Dance rasp, both late arrivals.
129. Cane Beds, Arizona, west of the Kaibab Paiute Reservation.
130. We are unable to identify this place with certainty, but it may
be Shem, the population and agency center on the Shivwits Reservation.
Lacking a mid front vowel, Southern Paiute speakers often substitute
[a] in their English. Similarly [s ] does not occur initially and may be
reflected as [s]. Sapir was not familiar with Utah place names, as the
manuscript suggests.
131. Little is known about Kaibab Paiute participation in the 1890
Ghost Dance movement. Kelly (1964: 106 — 107) relied upon Sapir's912X SouthernPaiute and Utenotes for her data. Sapir's data are minimal, since Tillohash apparently
had only seen or heard about it as a small child.
132. The central pole was part of the Northern Paiute version of this
dance, from which all others were adopted (Jorgensen 1986). The use
of a cane as a substitute may be uniquely Southern Paiute, perhaps
representing the canes a number of Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi
men commonly carried as a mark of status (see for example, Laird
1976).
133. Kelly's (1964: 120-121) statements about mythology are mostly
from Sapir's notes.
134. Sapir (1930e: 4 0 8 - 4 1 0 ) records this tale.
135. See Liljeblad (1986) for discussion of this class of spirits.
136. Sapir (1930e: 464 — 471) records this tale. The bird's name is
literally 'person carrier', but it is described as being a bird.
137. The string around the vagina is a common mythic theme in
southern California.
138. For more on the quality of voices of animal actors see Sapir
(1910d).
139. Again, this mythic theme is well known in the region.
140. Powell records the same theme (Fowler and Fowler 1971).
141. Kelly (1964: 134-135) gives additional data.
142. Kelly (1964: 136) gives a table correlating these data on month
names with those she received in 1933.
143. These four are the names of song cycles for the Cry or Mourning
Ceremony.
144. Kelly (1964: 107ff.) discusses a number of details on the Bear
Dance and its introduction to the Kaibab from the Ute. She uses Sapir's
account as background.
145. Above, Sapir describes the position of the hands as not on the
shoulders but behind the waist. Kelly (1964:109) also notes discrepancies
in hand positions.
146. By 1915, Lowie (1924: 299) was able to witness a Bear Dance
involving Shivwits people and locals at Moapa. He was told that the
dance had been adopted three or four years before.
147. Hillers photographed Paiute round dances near Kanab, Utah
about 1872 (Euler 1966: Appendix I, page 5, and Figure 24; Steward
1939, Plates 7 and 8).
148. Kelly's (1964: 98) data confirm lack of a dance for girls at
puberty.","[915, 916]"
"Post-nominal pronouns (or article-pronouns) are identical in form
with the shorter forms of certain of the independent third personal
pronouns (or demonstratives). T h e y are closely attached, though
not as phonetically amalgamated enclitics, to preceding nouns,
participles, adjectives, numerals, and pronouns, which they serve
to make clearly denominating terms. Frequently they hold together
a group of two or more words as a denominative unit, in which case
they may stand after the first word of the group instead of at the end.
T h e y are practically equivalent to postposed articles and are differentiated according to number, visibility and invisibility, animate and
inanimate, and, to some extent, case. On the whole, case distinctions
are neglected and primarily subjective forms often function also as
objectives. This seems to indicate a tendency towards development
into true articles. Ordinarily an article-pronoun follows immediately
upon the denominating term, but sometimes an intervening enclitic
(pronominal or other) element separates the two, e. g.

§ 43. Demonstrative pronouns.
There are four demonstrative stems, as already noted (§ 39, 1):
w
a- THAT (indefinite); i-,
THIS; ma-, m a'- THAT (visible; referred
to); and u-, "" V - that (invisible). These stems are not directly
used as independent demonstratives (except for rather infrequently
employed adverbs; a·, ma·'; see § 60, 2, d; 3), but need to be combined
with other elements. The following types of demonstrative usage
may be recognized:
( 1 ) DEMONSTRATIVE STEMS FOLLOWED BY POSTPOSITIONS.
These
are extremely common and correspond, in function, to inanimate
demonstrative pronoun + postposition. Examples are:ava"" that-at, there (indefinite)
aru'q-WA that-under, under it
maru'x-WA that (vis.)-to, to it
mava""anA that (vis.)-on, on it
mwa'va' that-at, there (not far away)
ι(y)t'nu this-at, here, present ( < i- a'n u-)
'i'va this-at, here
'i'upathis-through,
in this direction
uvwa"", 'u'vwax that (inv.)-at, there (inv.)
o 'p a'"" (< u-u'p-a'""), °'o'xpa'a (<'u'-up-a'"") t h a t ( i n v . ) - t h r o u g h , inyonder direction
( 2 ) DEMONSTRATIVESTEMS +THIRD PERSONPRONOMINALELE-MENTS. These forms function as independent third personal pronouns (§ 39, 1); as article-pronouns (§ 42); and as enclitic third personal pronouns (§ 40, 1). There is nothing further to be said about
them here except to note once more that these personal demonstratives
often preserve their proper demonstrative force.
( 3 ) V E R B S OF DOING. These are nothing but derivatives in -n i(§ 26,2, b) of the demonstrative stems. The idea of DOING, ACTING fre-Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE205quently passes over into that of HAVING SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ONE,
BEING. The verbs of doing are: an i- TO DO (indefinitely); mani'-,
mya'n i- τ ο DO (as indicated); in i'-, 'i'n-i- το DO IN THIS MANNER;
un i-, 'u'n i- τ ο DO IN THAT (narrated, unseen) MANNER. Examples
of these verbs are:

In their absolute form verbs of doing frequently function as adverbs of manner. In this capacity they may be combined with
forms of similar morphology that serve as verbs of doing. Examples
are:

iyiR INDEED, TRULY. This common adverb tends to amalgamate
loosely with preceding personal pronouns, independent or enclitic.
Thus, rii' iyiR is generally heard as m'iyiR; imi- iyiR appears as,
not i'm 'iyiR, but imi'tyiR (in general, -i- iyiR becomes iyiR); -ay
iyiR often coalesces to -ay g'iR (stopped g is sometimes heard for
y in others of these cases also). Present forms tend to take on
preterital significance with iyiR. Examples are:
rii' 'iyiR nfna'c i I indeed dream-present, I did indeed dream

'ja'i , 'oq'i' (objective inanimate invisible demonstrative in origin;
see § 42, 9 and § 43, 5) frequently used adverb (generally postverbal) of quite elusive significance. I t seems to have emphasizing
force. I t is particularly common after iyiR (see above); with preterital -tea- and -γωα- (§ 19, 1); after gerund -t si- (§ 55, 1, a); in
irrealis forms (§ 33, 1), particularly such as indicate unfulfilled
desire (WOULD THAT . . . !); after futures in -pa - (§ 32, 4);
after -ml·- ALREADY (§ 30, 13); and after substantive verbal -aq aIT is (§ 56, 3). In many cases it seems to turn absolute or present

is ordinarily known as noun incorporation. T h e absolutive or
classificatory suffix of the noun is frequently lost in noun-verb compounds. The syntactic relation implied between the verb and its
incorporated noun may be of various sorts. T h e incorporated noun
may be an instrument; it may indicate similarity; it m a y function
as a direct object; it may have local significance; it may function
as the subject of the verb; it may be a predicate of the subject; or it
may be a predicate of the object. Any of these relations may be,
and more often is, expressed by properly syntactic or morphological
processes. I t is not possible to give a simple rule as to when noun
incorporation is possible or required, whether, e. g., to say Ι TRAILSEEK or Ι SEEK A TRAIL. There is a good deal of option in this matter,
but m a n y cases of incorporation are fixed by idiomatic usage. There
is some tendency to express what might be called characteristic or
generalized relations by syntactic means. Any general and valid
rule, however, is hardly to be formulated.

"Not all verbs have a definite temporal form. The use of absolute
or tenseless verb forms is discussed in § 51, 2. Besides the temporal
suffixes here discussed, two of the enclitic elements express temporal
relations (§ 19, 1).
(1) -y'i- present tense. The great majority of verbs express a
specific reference to present time by means of this suffix. Examples
are:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGEqa-to singt'f'qa- to eat

them of extremely common occurrence, are used not with -y'i-, but
with -q a-, which refers indifferently to present or past time. Perhaps

"Introduction
The Great Basin of the western United States was, aboriginally,
occupied mainly by tribes who spoke languages of the Uto-Aztecan
family, specifically of the Numic branch. In older literature, this branch
is also referred to as ""Plateau Shoshonean,"" and the term ""Shoshonean""
has been used for a putative larger grouping within Uto-Aztecan.
Within Numic, three divisions are generally recognized. The Western
group includes language varieties labeled as Mono (or Monache) and
Owens Valley Paiute, in eastern California — plus Northern Paiute in
Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock in Idaho. Central Numic includes
Panamint (or Koso) in California; Shoshone in Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming; and Comanche in the southern Plains. Finally, Southern
Numic consists of Kawaiisu in California; Chemehuevi and Southern
Paiute in southern California, Nevada, Utah, and northwestern Arizona;
and Ute in Utah and Colorado.
The term ""Paiute"" itself, unfortunately, has no clear ethnic or linguistic reference; nevertheless, the term ""Southern Paiute"" is well established as referring to some sixteen Numic ""bands"" or subgroups which
share a geographical center in southern Utah. (For a survey of Numic
linguistics, see Miller 1986.) Among linguists, at least, it seems likely
that the currency of the term ""Southern Paiute"" has been reinforced by
its use in the title of one of Edward Sapir's most important works.
Sapir's research on Numic began with a field trip undertaken early
in his career. After fieldwork on Wishram Chinook in 1905, on Takelma
in 1906, and on Yana in 1907, Sapir completed his doctorate at Columbia University in 1908 and accepted a position at the University of
Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1909, with his student J. Alden Mason,
Sapir arrived in Utah to study Southern Numic speech, beginning with
the Uncompahgre Utes at Ouray Reservation. Finding that few Indians
there spoke adequate English, he soon moved to the Uintah Utes at
White Rocks (see Sapir's letter to A. L. Kroeber dated 7 September
1909, in Golla 1984: 43). A brief report, ""Some Fundamental Characteristics of the Ute Language,"" was published in 1910 (Sapir 1910c,
reprinted in Volume V of The Collected Works).
Back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1910, Sapir hoped to find
a Ute speaker at Carlisle Indian School near Harrisburg; instead, he14X SouthernPaiute andUtefound Tony Tillohash, who spoke the Kaibab dialect of Southern Paiute.
Tillohash moved to Philadelphia for four months, providing Sapir with
much more comprehensive data than had been obtained on Ute (see
Fowler and Fowler 1986). Four short papers resulted shortly thereafter:
""Song Recitative in Paiute Mythology"" (Sapir 191 Od), ""Two Paiute
Myths"" (1910f), ""The Mourning Ceremony of the Southern Paiutes""
(1912c), and ""A Note on Reciprocal Terms of Relationship"" (1913c);
these are reprinted in Volume IV of The Collected Works. However, the
major descriptive result was Sapir's Southern Paiute Language — a
grammar, a text collection, and a dictionary — written in 1917, but not
published until 1930 — 31. This work is reprinted in the present volume,
along with a previously unpublished English index to the dictionary,
prepared by Wick R. Miller.
Sapir's work on Numic linguistics is noteworthy from three viewpoints
in particular. First, his 1910 report on Ute described the typical Numic
phonological alternation of voiceless stops (p t k kw), voiced stops (b
d g gw), voiced fricatives (ß r γ yw), and voiceless fricatives (φ R χ
Xw); in his work on Southern Paiute, Sapir not only found the same
alternation, but also confirmed Tony Tillohash's intuitive awareness of
the relationship. Reported in Sapir's famous article, ""La realite psychologique des phonemes"" (1933c, in Volume I), this finding remains one
of the paradigmatic examples of modern phonological theory. Second,
Sapir's Numic data made possible a historical study, ""Southern Paiute
and Nahuatl"" (1913f and 1915i) — his first important work in the
comparative/historical study of American Indian languages, and a pioneering application in the New World of the Neogrammarian methodology established in the Indo-European field. All subsequent activity
in comparative Uto-Aztecan linguistics is founded on this work of
Sapir's. Third and finally, the Southern Paiute grammar itself has come
to be recognized as a monument of American descriptive linguistics: a
model of accuracy, clarity, thoroughness, and insight which later scholars have striven to emulate.
In addition to data on language, Sapir collected ethnographic information from his Numic consultants, and organized these materials with
eventual publication in mind. The resulting manuscripts had an ""underground"" existence after Sapir's death, being consulted by several
ethnographers. They have at last been edited for publication in this
volume, by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler, whose introductory essay explains the detailed circumstances.","[12, 13, 14]"
"(2) ENCLISIS. By enclisis is meant the suffixing of certain elements to any word in the sentence, the resulting complex constituting
a firm phonetic, but not a strictly formal, unit. Enclitic elements,
except for some of the pronouns, never occur in other than enclitic
form. In a ""word"" like ivi'rjunicar dam DID I T A K E A DRINK? The
preterital -ntca-, the interrogative -r'oa-, and the pronominal -ηι I
are enclitic elements, not true suffixes, the true ""word,"" formally
speaking, consisting only of ivi'yu- ΤΟ T A K E A DRINK (ivi- ΤΟ DRINK
+ momentaneous suffix -iju-). This is shown by the fact that the
enclitic cluster -(n)tcar'oam can be appended, without bringing about
any strictly formal modifications, to a preceding word in the sentence;
e. g. qan i'va tcar'oan ivi'yu H O U S E - A T - P R E T E R I T - I N T E R R O G A T I V E - I
DRINK- MOMENTANEOUS, DID I DRINK AT THE HOUSE?",[88]
"Number is expressed in the verb in four different ways: 1, by
reduplication, properly a distributive formation but frequently
expressing plurality of subject or subject (see § 58, 3); 2, by the use of
distinctive stems for the singular and plural, a few of the plural
stems being used only as second members of verb + verb compounds
(see § 54); 3, by the use of suffixes indicating plurality of the subject
or, less commonly, of the object; 4, by the use of suffixes expressing
ideas of number and voice (transitiveness and intransitiveness) at
the same time. Only the last two processes are here discussed.
Even aside from pronominal elements, it is always possible to tell
from the form of a verb whether its animate subject is singular or
plural, often, also, whether its object is singular or plural. Verbs
with a dual subject are singular in form, but are differentiated in
practice from singulars by their employment of plural (or, in two
cases, distinctively dual) pronominal elements (§ 40). Thus,X Southern Paiute and Ute

"( 1 ) T Y P E S OF GLOTTAL STOP.
Glottal stops occur very frequently
in Southern Paiute. They are rarely exaggerated in articulation,
however, and are often quite easily missed. The glottal stop may
function as an integral element of a stem (e. g. 'ayu- ΤΟ BE GOOD,
sa'a- ΤΟ BOIL) or grammatical element (e. g. -yw'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO,
-n'ni- continuative); as in itself a grammatical process occurring alone
(e. g. dubitative -', § 19, 2, n; -'- to indicate momentaneous activity,
§ 53,2, a, 3), with such grammatical processes as gemination and reduplication (§ 53, 2, b; § 58, 3 and 4) or in connection with certain enclitics,
chiefly pronominal (e. g. -' . . . .-mi- THY, THEE) ; in certain circumstances to separate vowels brought together by composition (§ 16, 2);
in final position after perfective -{n)tca- and -ywa- and after independent personal pronouns preceding verbs of doing and being (§ 5, 3).
The last group of cases may be considered as inorganic or non-functional. The first group of cases may be defined as involving an ""inherent""
glottal stop, the second and third an ""accessory"" glottal stop. The
distinction is important phonetically, inasmuch as a syllable containing an ""inherent"" glottal stop counts for two moras whether its
vowel is short or long, while a short-voweled syllable with ""accessory""
glottal stop counts for only one mora (see § 8, 1, a, end; 2, a, end;
§ 9, end). Outwardly these two types of glottal stop are identical,
but they probably belong to quite distinct historical strata, the
""accessory"" group no doubt representing a later development or
influencing of the word form. Rarely there is evidence to show
that an ""inherent"" glottal stop may arise by way of compensation
for the loss of a vowel. This seems to be true, at least, of na'y'iVA'tsirjw'i FATHER ABD SON ( < reciprocal NA- Η — T / W O ' A Ü L - , spirantized

"§ 47. Noun and verb stem.
All Paiute stems end in a vowel or diphthong. A peculiarity of the
great majority of noun and verb stems is that they are primarily
disyllabic, e. g. qan iHOUSE;
fivwi-a EARTH; αΙ α-° SAND; ραγ(«){-"" τ ο
GO; qari-"" ΤΟ SIT; paq a-° ΤΟ KILL. The typical monosyllabic stem (or
radical) of so many languages is conspicuous by its comparative
infrequency; moreover, practically all monosyllabic stems have two
moras, e. g. qa -' ΤΟ SING, pai-"" ΤΟ CALL to -"" BLACK, O - S ARROW, pen-""
BLOOD. If expressed in terms of moras, the typical Paiute stem
would probably be found to have two moras, i. e. to consist of a
monosyllable with a long vowel or diphthong, or, far more frequently,
of two short-voweled syllables. However, disyllabic stems of three
moras (e. g. tu-γυ•- ΤΟ CACHE, Una - BOTTOM) are not at all rare.
Trisyllabic stems, of three or more moras (e. g. as ia - SURFACE,
tayoq wi- ΤΟ RUN), are also fairly common; stems of four or moreSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE213syllables are rare (e. g. ttvwitsiya- ΤΟ OBEY). Were extended comparative Uto-Aztekan material available, it would no doubt be
possible to show that many of these trisyllabic and tetrasyllable
stems are capable of analysis. The two-moraed stem ending in a
vowel, of both monosyllabic and disyllabic structure, is clearly the
characteristic type of stem for all Uto-Aztekan languages.
Noun and verb stems are kept clearly distinct, the use of the same
stem now as noun, now as verb, being exceedingly uncommon. An
example is quq wa- WOOD, also ΤΟ GATHER WOOD (cf. English BERRY
and ΤΟ BERRY); note also ni(y)a- (two-moraed) ΤΟ CALL BY NAME,
but ni{y)a•- (three-moraed) NAME (it is quite possible, however, that
niya- really consists of niya- + possessive -α-, § 24, 2, a so t h a t niyawould be another example of a stem capable of being used either as
noun or verb).
From a strictly formal standpoint, noun and verb are, as we have
seen, carefully distinguished, there being very few grammatical
elements which are appended to both types of stem (e. g. diminutive
-tsi-, § 35; plural -q a-, § 31, 1, c and § 48, 2). However, there is a
slight tendency for verbs to be nominalized, without nominalizing
suffix, by means of nominal postpositions, but forms of this sort are
far from common (e. g. p'ivwa wim'jf aip a ntux wA WHICH-IN STANDPERFECTIVE-TO, TO WHERE ( H E ) HAD STOOD) ; see § 55,2. The clearest
syntactic indication of a feeling for nominal form is the presence of
article-pronouns (§42).
§ 48. Plurality of nouns.
There are two types of noun plurals: the reduplicated form, which
is more properly distributive in function, for both animate and
inanimate nouns (see § 58, 2 for these forms); and properly plural
suffixes, which can, for the most part, be appended only to noun
stems referring to animate beings (cf. the presence of singular and
plural animate forms and the lack of distinctively plural inanimate
forms in the third personal pronouns).
(1) ANIMATE PLURAL SUFFIXES. Two animate plural suffixes
exist, -ijw'i-' and -mi-', with exactly parallel functions and differentiated merely according to the preceding stem. These elements
apply to duals also, -r/w'i- is evidently spirantized from an older
-mi- (§16, 1); -mi- is the corresponding geminated (and nasalized)
form. Their Uto-Aztekan prototype *-me actually occurs as an
animate plural in Nahuatl {-mi).
In actual practice it seems hardlyX Southern Paiute and Ute
214SAPIRfeasible to assign -yw'i- to spirantizing stems alone, -m-'i- definitely
to all geminating (and nasalizing) stems, as their range of usage
seems to intercross with that of types of stem; thus, nominal -tsi-n
(§ 24, 1, f) forms plural -tsiyw'C-, while participial -ti-n (§ 25, 6) forms
-tim 'i-. No simple rules can therefore be given for the use of -yw'ior -ιιι ϊ-.
(a) -mi- (subjective); -m-ϊα- (objective). Examples are:
naya'mi
mountain sheep (sing. na'x A)
qA'qa'rami
quails (sing. qAzqa'w)
tciya'mi
ducks (sing. ici'x-A)
a(i)ya'm'i
turtles (sing. α'ΪΑ)
wTtca'mi
roadrunners (sing. wi't cA)
a'ivam iratjWA our (inclus.) young men (sing. a'i<t>Apits· young man)
yu'tami
Utes (sing, yu-'t-a-ts··, plur. also yu 't a tsajw'i)
In the last two examples a nominalizing suffix of the singular
(-ρ-'ttsi-, -isi-) has been dropped before the plural suffix. This is not
common; but cf., further, sari't'i'qami
ARAPAHO I N D I A N S (lit.
DOG-EAT-PLURAL, noun-verb compound noun; sing. sari 't Tqats ).
Animate plural -m 'i- is also appended to cardinal -yu- of numerals
for TWO and above, when used attributively with enclitic -n ta-,
before animate nouns, e. g.:
waa!(i)yumuni
wi'tsi'tsiywiarjA
two-cardinal-animate plur.-like

(b) -ijw'i- (subjective); -Tjwia-, rjwa(·)- (objective). The objective
in -rjwa{·)- is very common; it is merely a phonetic variant of -tjwia(see §4, 1, a). Examples of subjective -r/w'i- are:

to present time or, particularly in secondary substantival uses, is
tenseless. Participles of explicitly temporal reference may be
formed from the present participle by prefixing appropriate temporal

Animate plurals of active
participles have been already referred to. They end in -fi-m 'i-. A
curious idiom allows of their use also as singulars. This takes place
when the participle refers to a person (or animal) that is singled out
from a number or is compared with others. The plural ending of the
participle, in other words, refers to the implied collectivity rather
than to the person explicitly indicated. Examples are:

"The text material presented in this paper belongs to two rather
distinct, though closely related, dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
branch of Plateau Shoshonean. The bulk of the paper is devoted
to mythological and other texts obtained in 1910 (February to May)
from Tony Tillohash, a young Kaibab Paiute from Kanab, in southwestern Utah; the balance, to mythological texts and one tale recorded
in English, secured in 1909 (August and September) from Charlie
Mack, a Uintah Ute from White Rocks, Utah.
The Ute texts were obtained at White Rocks in the course of a
brief trip among the Utes of Uncompahgre and Uintah reserves.
A further series of thirty Ute tales was obtained in English by my
colleague, Dr. J. A. Mason; these were published under the title of
"" Myths of the Uintah Utes"" in The Journal of American Folk-Lore
for July-September, 1910 (pp. 299-363). I should not fail to add
that Dr. Mason also obtained a series of interesting pictographs in
the course of a reconnaissance of Nine Mile Canyon, some distance
south of Uintah Reservation. This material is still unpublished.
More substantial for linguistics than the Ute work were the results
obtained from Tony, who was in 1910 just about to complete his
course at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Through the
kindness of Dr. G. B. Gordon, the director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, and of the superintendent of the Indian
School, arrangements were made to have Tony housed in Philadelphia and employed at the Museum, so that he might be rendered available as a source of information for further Shoshonean
researches. Tony proved an excellent informant. Though young
and absent from his native home for about five years, he was of a
naturally conservative temperament and possessed of a remarkable
memory. Hence he was better informed on the subject of tribal
lore than could normally have been expected. His unfailing good
humor and patience also helped materially to lighten a task that
demanded unusual concentration. (Indeed, in all my linguistic
experience, I doubt if phonetic perception has ever been so severely
taxed as in recording Shoshonean dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
group.) Besides the Kaibab Paiute texts here presented, there wereX Southern Paiute and Ute
300SAPIRsecured from Tony supplementary material for the grammatical and
lexical study of his language; a series of over two hundred songs,
chiefly ceremonial, recorded in text and on the phonograph; and a
considerable body of ethnological information. The grammatical
data have been worked up into a sketch of the Paiute language,
which forms the first part of this volume. The lexical material follows in the third part. The songs and the ethnological data will
form the subjects of future papers. Tony, further, proved valuable
as a first-hand source for a seminar in American Indian linguistics
that I was then giving at the University of Pennsylvania. Last, but
not least, he was a delightful companion at all times and is remembered with the friendliest feelings by all who came in contact with
him in Philadelphia.
The linguistic relation of Southern Paiute (to be carefjlly distinguished from Northern Paiute or ""Paviotso"") to Uintah Ute is
close. Indeed, they are not so much closely related languages as
mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. This probably
applies to all the dialects of Ute-Chemehuevi, which may be defined
as a dialectically differentiated Shoshonean language stretching from
Uncompahgre Ute in central Colorado to Chemehuevi in southeastern
California. The texts embodied in the present volume are therefore
illustrative of one of the most widespread languages of aboriginal
America, though the specific dialects of the texts, Kaibab Paiute and
Uintah Ute, cover only restricted territories in southwestern Utah
and northwestern Arizona and in northeastern Utah respectively.
No attempt has been made to normalize the texts, which are given
here precisely as heard. The phonetic system used is that described
in the report of the Phonetic Committee of the American Anthropological Association ; l the symbols are defined in the key prefixed to
the texts. Those wishing to make an analytical study of the language
are referred to the Paiute grammar which precedes; the necessary
lexical assistance is given by the Paiute dictionary which follows.
In their mythological affiliations the tales recorded here evidently
correspond closely to the Ute, Shoshone, and Comanche tales already
published by Kroeber, Mason, Lowie, and St. Clair. References to
parallel tales have been confined to Plateau Shoshonean. Further
parallels from other Plateau tribes, from Plains tribes to the east,
and from California and Washington-Oregon tribes to the west are

"Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean229LanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE211§ 45. The relative pronoun.
The Paiute relative pronoun, pi-, can be used only with postpositions; e. g. pima- WITH WHICH, pu'urai- WHERETO, WHITHER,
pivwa- IN WHICH, WHERE. The equivalent of our own subjective and
objective relative clauses is afforded by participles and verbal nouns
in -na- (§ 25, 3). Properly speaking, pi- is a noun, as is shown by
the fact that it is frequently followed by an inanimate article-pronoun.
The verb following the relative is generally in the form of a verbal
noun in -n a-, less frequently in the form of a participle in -p i- (§
25, 5, b), rarely a non-participial absolute; hence the logical subject
of a relative clause is always objective (i. e. possessive) in form. A
sentence like THIS IS THE STICK THAT I HIT HIM WITH is rendered by
THIS IS THE STICK WITH WHICH (IS) MY HITTING (OR HAVING HIT) HIM.","[228, 229]"
"(5) REDUPLICATION (see § 58). As a formal process reduplication
is always initial. Final reduplication occurs only in isolated words
and has no formal or derivational function. There are several
distinct types of reduplication. The ideas expressed by the process
are chiefly those of distribution, iteration and momentaneous activity
(6) C O N S O N A N T A L C H A N G E S . These are quite apart from the
mechanical changes undergone by consonants in composition (§ 16).
Consonantal changes include:
(a) Gemination of stem consonants (see § 53, 2, b). The geminating
of the consonant or consonants indicates generally momentaneous
or semelfactive as contrasted with durative activity. I t is also
frequently found in connection with certain types of reduplication
(see § 58, 3 and 4). Less commonly it is employed alone to give
iterative force to the stem (see § 53, 2, b). Sporadic examples in
noun derivationalso occur, e. g. aip a-tsi- B O Y : aiva-(p 'äsi-) Y O U T H .
(b) Glottalization, the insertion of a more or less movable glottal
stop in the body of a stem or suffix. This occurs most frequently in
connection with certain types of reduplication (see § 58, 3 and 4).
Like gemination, it is also used to express momentaneous activity
and iteration (see § 53, 2, a). Gemination and glottalization tend to
be associated or equivalent processes. This may eventually help
to clear u p the origin of the geminating power of certain stems (§ 16,
2).",[89]

(predicative) or participles of verbs (attributive). There are, however, a few cases of true adjectives with nominal suffixes (e. g.

(2) E L E M E N T S DEFINING POSSESSION. Here are grouped a number
of suffixes that appear chiefly with possessive pronominal enclitics and
which, on the whole, define the nature of the possessive relation.
It is not always easy, as a matter of fact, to see exactly what increment
of significance they bring.
(a) -a- seems to be used to indicate possession that is alienable,
particularly, it would seem, of such objects as are not normally
thought of as being possessed. It is generally preceded by -ρϊ-*
(see 1, d and e). Examples are:
fivwi'piariimi
our (excl.) country {-riimi our); RVwL ρ 'Laiariimi our
country (obj.) (-ία- objective, § 49, 1).
ρα·'""νϊαηι spring that I own
a'oTjqovianl my dried-up woods
üyqa'nivia(i)ya'i)WA his cave (obj.) owned as house (-ya- objective);
fiijqa'nLviatsia^i
his own little cave (obj.) (-tsi- diminutive; -aobjective; -φϊ, § 40, 4)
Possessive -a- may also be used with causative -tui- (§ 29, 12)
to form verbs indicating ΤΟ CAUSE TO HAVE SO AND SO, e. g.:
tumpwi' Apiiplya' caused (it) to have stones
qan-L Atuip lya
caused (it) to have houses
nayqa'Atuip 'iya caused (it) to have branches
For possessive -a- combining with verbalizing -kai- το HAVE into
-ayai- (participle -ayaiifi-), see § 26, 1, b; for possessive -a- after
past passive participial -ρ ϊ-, see 3, b below.
(b) -rjwa-, -t)'wa-. These elements are used very much like -α-,
occurring both before possessive pronominal enclitics and verbalizing
-kai- το HAVE, not, however, before causative -tui-.
They do not
seem to be used after elassificatory -pi- (1, d and e), but may be
directly appended to noun stems. Examples of -ψνα- are:
pai'ywani
my blood (absolute pai'p r, in possessive forms of this
noun -ywa- is always used)Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE121•u(w)i'i)wayant'i canyon-possessive-having, canyon

wife) somebody else's wife taken away (by him)
rivtwa''ur]wat uintiT)wani
snow-rain-become (§ 26, 1, g)-present ptc.
(§ 25, 6, a)-possessive-my, snow belonging to me (snow-raining =
snow)
Examples of -rfwa- (it is not clear how, if a t all, it differs in usage
from -rjwa-) are:
tümp'°i'y'wa i)A his rock
ma'xarir'iijwa(i)yayA
his clump of trees (obj.)
qa-'n(uinüTj'wa yA sing-become (§ 26, 1, g)-present ptc. (§ 25, 6, a)possessive-his, song belonging to him
Both -ywa- and -rfwa- are used particularly to indicate possession
of one of a group by the group (e. g. OUR LEADER = THAT ONE OF US
WHO is LEADER). This includes adjectival participles indicating
selection (e. g. THE GOOD ONE of several). Examples are:
nia 'vuj'waraywA our chief; qani'ayanfiA nia 'viij'wA house-possessivehaving-obj. chief-possessive, village's chief
ampa'xarirj'wa m i talker- possessive-their, their talker; qan i ayanti
ampa'xariy'wA village's main speaker
ava'Ciijw'aijw'uywA

fWi'tc at vr)wa{i)'yaq wA very good-present ptc.-obj.-their (inan.),
a very good one of them (inan.)
(c) - a- is used to indicate possession, chiefly of body-parts, t h a t
is inherent without being strictly inalienable. In other words, it
is suffixed to nouns indicating objects (or persons) t h a t do often
occur disconnected in experience (e. g. SALIVA, BONE, SKIN) but are
thought of as indissolubly connected. Examples are:X Southern Paiute and Ute
122SAPIRoo""am my bone (i. e. bone of my own body); αηα'νϊοο'α shoulderbone-possessive, shoulder-blade: absolute οο'φϊ bone

nir/w'i""a(i)yaqA
person-possessive-obj.-its, its (country's) people
(obj.)
(d) -in'{n)i-' (-'in i-') OWNED. This element is always employed
with alienable nouns and has a specific reference to actual ownership
as contrasted with mere possession in the grammatical sense. Examples are:
pura'oin'nini
my flour
•poo'in'ninl my owned trail (not merely: trail t h a t I use)
8αχιν(ε')ίαίη'ηίηι my owned belly, (some animal's) belly t h a t I

(e) -vurjqu-', -p uyqu-', -mputjqu-"" PET, DOMESTICATED ANIMAL. This
is no true suffix, but merely the compounded form of purjqu-' HORSE
(belonging to one; contrast qava"" HORSE absolutely), originally PET,
DOMESTICATED ANIMAL, DOG (cf. Tübatulabal puygu-l DOG).
I t is
listed here because it is regularly added to all nouns denoting owned
animals. I t is a suffix in the making. Examples are:
qava 'vuyquni my horse (more frequently simply puyqu'ni)
pi 'xivurjquraqWA pig-pet-our, our pig
a{i)ya'vu7jquni my turtle
sari 'vuTjquni my dog; sari 'vuyquxwai- to have a dog
qu'tcu'mpuyquni buffalo-pet-my, my ox; quHcu'mpuinpurjquywirarjWA
buffalo-pets (for reduplication see § 58, 2, d) -animate plur.-our,
our cattleSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN P A I U T E , A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE123(3) T E N S E ELEMENTS. Tense can be expressed in nouns provided
they are first verbalized. This is generally done by suffixing -Icai- ΤΟ BE
(§ 26, 1, a) and then turning the denominative verb into a participle.
Thus, the future form of qava-' HORSE is qava 'xaiva nti HORSE-BEFUTURE-PARTICIPLE, A HORSE ΤΟ BE; similarly, qam 'i'xawätci JACKRABBIT-BE-USITATIVE-PARTICIPLE, ALWAYS A JACKRABBIT.
Here we
shall specifically list only two compound suffixes relating to past
time, because of their rather characteristic usage.
(a) -yaip'i-,-qaip-ϊ-,-ijqaip· Ϊ-HAVINGBEEN,compounded of -Icai- ΤΟ BE and past participial -piExamples are:PAST,FORMER;(see § 25, 5, a).ini'ayaipini

rat-hunt-place-be-past partic.-obj.-his, place
(obj.) where he used to h u n t rats
tma'uykaipi
punch-er-be-past partic., one who used to be a puncher
(b) -p i- PAST, FORMER. This is the past participial -p i- (see § 25,
5, a), only rarely used with noun stems, e. g.:
qanip'iabandoned house, village site, old camping placeI t is sometimes found combined with possessive -a- (2, a) as
e. g.:
a'i<t>Api(y)anyivw'ini
youthful friend-ρϊα-,youth-past-possessive- friend-my, my formerThis -ρ ϊα- occurs also combined with other elements in verbal
forms (see -p'ia-yai-tua-,
§ 32, 8; -p 'ia-yi-, § 32, 7)
§ 25. Nominalizingsuffixes.","[137, 138, 139, 140, 141]"
"Several of these are used in idiomatic connections that do not readily
yield insight into their primary significance. I t is believed, however,
that the chief elements and uses are given below.
(a) -yainta-, -ayainta- TOO, ALSO. These elements always follow
pronominal enclitics, when present. The form -ayain ia- is probably
compounded of -a- (see 3, a below) and -yain ta-; it is not at all clear
how it differs in use or meaning from -yain• ια-.^γαϊη • ia- itself is perhaps
compounded of -πια- (see d below). Examples of -yainta- ALSO, TOO
are:
rii'xain i I too
uijwa'c • uywain ι that one too
cv'yuxwain i still another one
riimy'i%aint
we (exclusive) too
tFqa'xw'aivanixaini
I also will go to eat
Examples of -ayain-ia- TOO are:
riiywi'axaini ya'a'ilfa' person-too died
marja'iAcuaxain i urjwaru"" aru""anA his-too he-is being, he belongs to
him too
Sometimes -{a)yaintarii'axainis elided to -(a)yain·, e. g.:y/tu'va n i I-too will-doA frequent modal use of -yainta- is to indicate a somewhat unexpected inference or an emphasis on an idea that might be questioned.
I t may then be rendered IT TUHNED OUT, IT SEEMS, INDEED, JUST.
Examples are:
mari'acuxwainC
qant'ptnt
naya'<j>Axqafpiya' that (house) -itturned-out old-abandoned- house-like seemed

90SAPIRAn example of doubly elided -yain- is:
a'in'mayaxain·'a'ik -A that-he-indeed said, that is what he did say(b) -ya'a- THEN ! INDEED. This element, which follows pronominal
enclitics, has emphasizing force. I t is particularly common in
optative and hortatory sentences. Examples are:
ρα'α'ίχ.υ·η·ΐχα' 'oai' die-would-I-indeed (for 'oat' see § 60, 3), would
that I might die!
paiyi'k• ujur/jv ijwaxa' 'oai' return-hither-momentaneous-would-he-in-deed, would that he might come back!

mv,ayaya '''xa'a that one, indeed
(c) -ywa- SHOULD, OUGHT. This enclitic is doubtless identical
with preterital -ywa- (1, b above). When used as modal enclitic of
obligation or in mild imperatives, it is followed by enclitic -noa- (see
e below). Examples are:
(•u)mwaniiJfaim iaywar'iianoA thus- resultative-usitative-should- interrogative-probably; that is not how one should act, be

qari""miaxwa'n oA sit-usitative-should-thou-probably, you shall stay
Wi'xwa yan oA go-ahead-should-him-probably, go ahead and—him!
(d) -n ia- LIKE. This is one of the most constantly recurring
enclitics. Though its primary significance is that of resemblance,
it is employed in several fairly distinct nuances of meaning and
enters into many idiomatic turns of expression. Its primary meaning
is clearly illustrated in:
-ψΐί'ο ηπί naya'p a rjupiya' thus-again-like appeared, (it) looked just
like before
αχα'ηϊηίαηι naya'<j>Axqa* how-like-I appear? what do I look like?
so ""itsini like a soldier
rmt'an in i like my father (note that -n ia- follows possessive -n imy, but precedes subjective or objective pronominal enclitic; cf.
second example above)Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language
SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE91A dubitative tinge is often present, in which case -π ια- may be
rendered IT SEEMS, AS IT W E R E , AS THOUGH, e. g.:
pAxqa'yufi'qanfinia ' j a-/)A naya'vai' kill-passive-having-been-like-it-he
seems, it seems that he has been killed, it looks as though he has
been killed
qu'qwt'va p 'iyain'ni'aywA shoot-future-past-like-him, acted as though
about to shoot him
άηα'ψυανϊηι coyote, it seems
This dubitative tinge may become so deepened as to justify the
rendering of -nia- as PERHAPS, e. g.:
ti'ma'q Aqain an ιαταη 'urjwA roast-plural subject-perfective-verbal
noun-like-our he, perhaps the one whom we have roasted
u'u'rjwani'aml tini'arjqiq a'aiml he-like-thee tell-to-perfective-thee,

The idea of resemblance may also shade off into that of limit or
emphasis, e. g.:

with suffixed durative -ya- (see § 30,1). For -»-{β- with numeral stems,
see § 36, 1; with certain postpositions, § 50, 4: 7, 35, 39; with certain
adverbs, § 60, 1.
Quite unclear is -n'nia- following demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5) in
cases like:
a'in'niayaxain- 'a'ik -A that-like (?) -he- indeed said, that is what
he did say
Its glottal stop is unexplained.","[107, 108, 109]"
"( 1 ) OCCURRENCE OF h,
Only such cases are here considered as
are not due to unvoicing of moras (see § 8).(a) Initial Aspiration.
Certain words t h a t begin with a vowel are
frequently heard preceded by aspiration, e. g. ai-, 'ai- τ ο SAY; demonstrative α-, ai-, 'α-, 'ai- (see § 43), whence an i-, 'an i- τ ο DO; atei-,
'at&i- BOW. Comparison with other Shoshonean dialects suggests
t h a t in part, at least, these initial aspirations are the representatives of
a Shoshonean h-; e. g. ay a-, less frequently 'aya- WHAT? : Agua Caliente
haxa WHO? Initial ' is found also in certain interjections, e. g. 'q
SURPRISE; ' a a ' i b w i OH! Initial * does not function as a consonant,Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGEhence does n o t prevent elision (see § 7); e. g. a'i
INDEED THOU SAYEST, n o tly'ir49'a'imtTHATly'lR.(b) Developed from -s·-, -c·-. This sporadic development occurs
only medially, never in a final syllable. T h e -h- is strongly aspirated
and seems to be particularly common after a voiceless vowel, e. g.:

(negative -rjw'a- counts for two
moras)
(c) Inorganic -'-. Rarely is an inorganic -'- introduced before a
voiced consonant or glottal stop. I t m a y take on the timbre of
the preceding vowel. Examples are:

(2) POSTVOCALIC w. An intervocalic -w- is ordinarily a glide
(see § 14, 3, a). When an initial w comes, b y derivation or compounding, to stand after a vowel, it regularly becomes nasalized to

( 3 ) ASSIBILATION OF DENTALS. N O dental consonant, aside from
n, i. e. t and its derivatives t\ r, r, is, with very few exceptions, found
before i. Comparison with other Shoshonean or Uto-Aztekan
dialects shows t h a t an original Shoshonean ti became assibilated to
tsi, e. g. noun ending -tsi-: Tübatulabal and Southern Californian -t.
Further, comparison shows that an original Shoshonean ati not only,
in Southern Paiute, assibilates the t but also shifts the i to ϊ, whence
atci. Most Plateau dialects have ati in these cases, e. g.:Shoshonean *ati bow
> Bankalachi a li-t,
Shikaviyam t'di,
Mono tli
Shoshonean *paii daughter
> N. Paiute padiS.P. atci-S.P. patci- (original Shoshonean
*pati would have become *ραή-)Hence S. Paiute atsi represents an old Shoshonean atsi with primary
is; e. g. contrast primary patsi- OLDER SISTER (cf. Cora hatsi OLDER
BROTHER; Cora h often < p) with patci- < *pati DAUGHTER.
There are a small number of cases of true -ri- (not -ri- < - n - ;
§ 3, 2, b), b u t these m a y well represent a group of loan-words taken
in subsequently to the operation of the above law, e. g. mori - BEAN;

the primary U, tc and the ts, tc developed from t before original i
are examples of tc t h a t arise whenever a non-geminated t, t h a t would
ordinarily be spirantized to r (see § 16, 1), stands after an i. In this
stratum, which constitutes a living process, t- and -r-, -tc- constantly
interchange. Examples are:

When i is preceded by a nasal consonant, the -t-, -r- develops to
-ntc- (see § 16, 3), e. g. qani-wtcu'a- H O U S E ?
Geminated -ί-, it should be carefully noted, does not assibilate to
-tc- after i, but remains, e.g. tümpwi'-t-u- ΤΟ MAKE A S T O N E ; na'a'itu'p""ikuqwa'
HAS B U R N T UP.
Nasalized -nt- also is regularly unaffected by a preceding i; e. g.
ovwi'nto'tsi$a' WOODEN-HEADED, ovwi'ntuv'°a n-i W I L L MAKE WOOD,
ovi'ntu'arjuntca-rjA H E BECAME A STICK. There is, however, a tendency for such cases of -nt- to become assibilated to -ntc-; e. g.
o{w)i'pintcu- to make a canyon ( < oi'pi-"", see § 16, 3). In such
cases the theoretical -nt- is sometimes even replaced by the ""spirantal""
form -tc-; e. g. ovi'tcuqwA UNDER T H E STICK (but also ovi'ntuq-WA).
After ai- το SAY, -1-, -r- develops to -nie-, not -tc-, e. g. ai-ntciSAYING. On the other hand, usitative -mi- (§ 30, 10) changes a following -<-, -r- to -nt-, not -ntc-, e. g. ai-rni-nti- B E I N G WONT TO S A Y ; cf. - 7 0 nfi- HAVING < -yai- ΤΟ HAVE (§ 25, 6, a), -q a-nfi- HAVING - E D < perfective -q ai- (§ 25, 6, d). There are historical antecedents involved
here which can be unraveled only by comparative evidence.
(4) PALATALIZATION. An i palatalizes a following k- sound, less
frequently a dental or back-palatal nasal (n, y). Acoustically this
is manifested as a y- like affection of the consonant. I t is indicated,
in the case of back-palatals, by the symbol for anterior articulation
(e. g. k, sounding approximately like ky); by a superior "" in the
case of n.
The ny (approximately like Russian ""soft"" or mouille n) appears
most often between two i- vowels, particularly when the second is
unvoiced, e. g. maa'in-H- το TOUCH, maa'in""i*kant'i HAVING TOUCHED.
The palatalized η (approximately like French gn, possibly more
posterior in articulation) is not very common, as the combination
-irj- occurs only infrequently, e. g. iya- H E H E R E .
The palatalized k- sounds are k < k, q; k- (written k?) < k\
7ι X < γ, χ; χ < x; yw, χυ) < yw, χιν. χ is practically identical
with ch of German ich. y is very close to y, but more spirantal in

point of voicing, between y (of which it is merely a variant) and x.
Examples of palatalized k- sounds are:

"There are two groups of suffixed elements that indicate voice, i. e.
direction of action with reference to subject, object, or indirect object.
The first group (1-9) is a primary series that is not freely used; that is
closely welded with the verb stem (often with internal stem changes);
that occurs in contrasting pairs of mediopassive (or intransitive)
and active (or transitive); and that, for the most part, involve at the
same time other ideas than that of voice, namely verbal aspect (see
3 below) and number. This group will be only listed here for convenience of reference and taken up later under other headings. The
second group (10-14) is used with great freedom and indicates voice
relations of a somewhat more external sort. Suffixes of the latter
sort are often appended to the former.
(1) -q-i- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of momentaneous aspect
and singular number (see § 30, 3).
(2) -71-, (-ijqi-) mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of iterative-durative aspect (see § 30, 2).
(3) -ya- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of durative aspect (see
§ 30, 1).
(4) -tcai- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of primarily durative
aspect and of plural number (see § 31, 2, a).
(5) -na- transitive suffix of durative aspect and singular number
of object (see § 31, 2, b).
(6) -n'na- transitive suffix of momentaneous aspect and singular
number of object (see § 31, 2, c).
(7) -tea- transitive suffix of plural number of object (see § 31, 2, d).
(8) -a - final stem vowel indicating active voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -i- (9).
(9) -i- final stem vowel indicating inactive voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -a - (8).
(10) -rjqi-"" transitivizing or activating suffix appended to verbs
of primarily mediopassive aspect. It is particularly common with
preceding -q i-, -yi- (1 and 2 above) and generally occurs with an
instrumental prefix in the verb (§ 21). Before it mediopassive -i- (see
9 above) sometimes becomes active -a - (8); an -a- of the active stemX Southern Paiute and Ute

LANGUAGE145The idea of FOR quite often leads to the ""ethical dative."" In such
cases the person of the indirect object is not really affected by the
action at all but is merely interested in it. Such ethical datives with
first person indirect object are frequently employed to indicate an
affectionate attitude on the part of the speaker, e. g.:
αχα'η iyqitjuqwaiyurii' ani'k a
what-do-for-momentaneous-resultative-subordinate-me-thou do-so? what happened to you for me?

Much less frequently -iui- makes causatives out of nouns, e. g.:X Southern Paiute and Ute

form of an older variable -r'ui-, -t ui-, -ntui-, which has become
generalized for all cases. There seems also to have been an alternation between momentaneous -t'ui- andd urative -r'ui- (see § 53, 2, b).
An example of causative -ntui- is 'a'cmtui- τ ο LIKE. Causative
-r'ui- (durative) is exemplified in iyä'r'ui- το CAUSE TO BE AFRAID, TO
FRIGHTEN; with this contrast momentaneous iya'tuiτο FRIGHTEN
(at one moment of time).
(12a) -n-i- causative. This element occurs so uncommonly t h a t
it has not been found possible to determine its precise application.
Examples are:
yu'u'rumpiyai(y)aqaijA
leg-make-causative-past-it (vis.)-he (vis.),
he made a leg out of it
naywi'qa'minip'iya'
self-cover-causative-past, covered (him)self

Ν A' SO'XO' ma'mp'iya'
covered (him)self with moist ground, dirt (cf.
also NA^sa'xu'map 'iya' covered self with dirt)
In the last two examples, which are provided with reflexive prefixes, it is to be noted t h a t the reflexive is better considered the logical
object of the causative suffix than of the verb; e. g. HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE COVERED, not HF. CAUSED TO COVER HIMSELF.
Contrast,
with ordinary causative -tui- (12), navl' η ifuik • ai (y)ayan/ H E CAUSED
ME TO S E E HIMSELF, not HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO SEE ME. Possibly -n-iis best defined as an indirect causative, like -rjqi- (10, 11), whose -yis perhaps a reduced form of -ni-; e. g. HE MADE IT INTO A LEG,
HE COVERED TO HIMSELF.(13) -ti -s passive; sometimes heard as -H-, but always twomoraed. This suffix is freely used to make true passives out of
transitive verbs. Examples are:
tana- to hit, punch
pAxqa-r)u- to kill
ivi-c-ua-ψι-to drink u pt,ma't i svwa n-iani I shall be hit

The last two examples illustrate passive participles in -t'i-ri-n (cf.
§ 25, 6, a). These differ from passive participles in -pi- and -p'i(§ 25, 5) in referring to passing or non-characteristic states. Contrasting with SA'pi'x-AtiRi, for instance, is SA'pi'xam ip i ONE WHO
IS ALWAYS OVERCOME (-m i- is usitative, § 30, 10).
Passives may be readily formed from causatives, e. g. ivi'( uii}uti tca r)A D R I N K - C A U S E - M O M E N T A N E O U S - P A S S I V E - P R E T E R I T -H E , HEWASHere the causative suffix precedes the passive,
as is to be expected. Curiously enough, the same order is followed
in causatives of passives, an indirective -rjqi- coming in between the
causative suffix and the passive - t i - , e. g.:
CAUSED TO DRINK.uiyki'fi v""'a yarayWA
catch-cause-to-passive-shall-he-us, he will
get us caught (lit., he will cause to us to be caught)
pA'qa'niuiyqiti tca rjA kill-cause-to-passive-preterit-him, (he) caused
him to be killed (for -nlui- cf. 12 above)
maa'i(In other words, the passive suffix can not precede the causative.
In the preceding examples the indirective is required to point to the
logical object as the indirect object, the passive of the verb itself
being apparently conceived of as the direct object, e. g. H E WILLCAUSE-BEING-CAUGHT TO-US.
That these forms are causatives of
passives, not, as would be inferred from their appearance, passives of
causatives, is proved by the absence of a plural subjective -q a- (see
§ 31, 1, c) in the first form above; this would be required if the fomr
were to be understood as WE SHALL B E CAUSED TO B E CAUGHT BY HIM.
(14) -tu'a-' (-t' ua- ) impersonal. Verbs with impersonal subject
or, less often, object refer either to an indefinitely defined person or
to a collectivity, people in general. In the latter case, if used sub
jectively, it may be preceded by the pluralizing -qa- (§ 31, 1, c). The
impersonal suffix is often employed as the equivalent of the passive,
never simultaneously with it. It follows perfective -qai- and narrative preterit -ρϊ(α)·γαί-, but precedes present -yi- and future
-va (nia)(see § 34). Curiously enough, present -yi- regularlyX Southern Paiute and Ute
148SAPIRfollows -tu'a- even in preterit tense forms (cf. also -p• la-yai-tua-y'i-; §
32, 8). As already noted (§ 19, 2, e), it is frequently accompanied
by enclitic -w oa-. Examples of subjective -t-u'a- are:
pAKqa'rju(ua{i)ylayA kill-momentaneous-impersonal-present-him, they
(indef.) kill him, he is being killed
pApa' cp Aqwa' iyupi'iyai' (iia(i)yiaml kill (distributive)- go-momentaneous-past-impersonal-present-them, people went to kill them

tVqa'qAtuayir'uanuaxainC
eat-plural-impersonal-present-interrogative-indefinite-indeed, it seems that people are eating
As impersonal object -t u'a-' seems to be used only indirectly after
-rjqi-, e. g.:

sing-to-impersonal-present-I, I sing with them

naia' i}v)tijrp(uaq • XA piya'
play-hand-game-to-impersonal-plural-past,

played with them
These examples show that -yqi-i ua- generally denotes cooperation
with a group. Moreover, the two suffixes form a close unit, as they
occur before elements that would normally precede -t-u'a- alone (e. g.
-yw'ai- ΤΟ GO TO, narrative preterit -p 'iyai-, plural subject -q-a-);
see above examples.
§ 30. Suffixes of verbal aspect.
By ""aspect,"" a term borrowed from Slavic grammar, is here meant
the temporal range of the action, i. e. its definition with respect to
such concepts as momentaneousness, durativeness, inception, iteration. These and like concepts have no primary connection with
the concept of relative time, which is the province of the temporal
suffixes (§ 32).","[161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166]"
"A few remarks on verbs of doing and saying are all we need offer
here. As numerous examples scattered through this paper have
already shown, verbs of doing and saying are frequently used in
Paiute in a wider sense than is customary in English. Verbs of
doing, i. e. verbs in -n i- (§ 26, 2, b; § 43, 3; § 44, 2, a), often refer, in a
loose manner, to any activity or state but those of speech, sound,
and mental operation. A correspondingly loose reference to activities and states of the latter sort is made by verbs of saying (ui- and
mai-, § 43, 6). Thus, un i- τ ο DO and ai- το SAY are equivalently
used in expressions in -n-a-c-u-(vw'i~) (ONE'S OWN) — I N G AGAIN implying continuous and exclusive activity, e. g.:

qualitative and a quantitative one. To the former belong the
change of an a, a·, o, or u of the singular verb stem to an i in the
plural (§ 53, 1, b); the alternation of semelfactive -i- with durative or
iterative -a- (§ 53, 1, c); and the alternation of active - a - with static
or medio-passive -i- (§ 53,1, d). The latter process, vocalic lengthening, is employed partly to indicate futility, partly in certain continuative forms.

The order of the letters of the Paiute alphabet used in this dictionary
is based on that of the letters of the English alphabet, except that
certain letters, symbolizing secondary sounds, are considered mere
variants of others, symbolizing primary sounds. Thus, ν is considered
a variant of p; r, of t; k and y, of q; kw and yw, of qw; c, of s; ts, of tc;
and o, of u.
The order, then, of initials and medials in the main entries is as
follows:
InitialMediala
i-a-i-ϊ-Ϊ-m
n-m-n-η-qw-o-o-P-p-q (k)-q- (-k-)
-y-qw (kw)-q w- (-k w-)
-yvf-s (c)
t- S - (-C-)-t-tc (ts)-r-tc- (-ts-)
-t c- (-t s-)u (o)-U- ( - 0 - )w
y-y--' (only as enclitic)Of the nasalized stops, -mp- comes after -mo-; -nt- comes after
-no-·, -ψι~ comes after -T)3-\ and -ijqw- comes after -ijq-. A reduplicating syllable does not count. Further, note that ' or h plus vowel
is considered equivalent to that vowel. Long vowels or repeated
vowels summing to two moras (e. g., aa — a ) come after short
vowels; syllables affected by ' (whether of type 'a or a', which areX Southern Paiute and Ute
540SAPIRconsidered equivalent) come after equivalent syllables not so affected.
Thus, for words with initial α the order is:
a
a'a
ä(""a, ha)
(aa)
(a', a'a)
(ii'j ä j et- ä jThe main entries and sub-entries are given as stems and elements
in a thoroughly normalized form, no vocalic variants (e. g., t for ϊ)
being recognized. All voiceless vowels are restored to their voiced
form. This means that no voiceless spirants are entered, for these
are merely secondary forms of voiced spirants before voiceless vowels.
Non-initial stops following voiceless vowels are restored to their
fundamental geminated form. E. g., the recorded qA'qa'RA appears
as the entry qaq ara-. On the other hand, the actually recorded
forms, which follow these theoretically fixed entries, are given as
notated, with all their regular phonetic changes and in their heard
variants. Final -* after consonant, however, is regularly restored to
its proper voiceless vowel; e. g., qani'ay' would be given as qaniai)A.
There are also other slightly regularizing changes which will help the
student. For compounded stems beginning with -ν-, see p-; with
-τ-, see <-; with -γ-, see q- (k-); with -yw-, see qw- (Jew-); with -ψο-,
see w- or m- (a few cases of -yw-, however, where the evidence for
derivation from w- or m- is lacking, are separately entered under
-ψν-).
The main entries are in roman small capitals (the vowels are in these
always to be interpreted as fundamental voiced vowels). Under
these the sub-entries are given in indented italic form; they consist
of derivatives of the main entries.
The following symbols are used:
(*:)enclose inorganic element, i. e. element which is not theoretically present; e. g., o( ) indicates short a which is secondarily lengthened, y(a)i indicates parasitic a
separates radical elements and affixes from each other; does
not indicate syllabic division
indicates long vowel resulting from contraction of vowels
belonging to distinct morphological elements, e. g. qaru'-a-rjA
from qani'-a-aTjA
