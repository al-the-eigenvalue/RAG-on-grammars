Paragraph,Page number
"The strictly final position of the negative implies that any negative sentence consisting of
more than one clause allows more than one interpretation, depending on whether the scope of
the negation includes the main or the subordinate predicate. Consider:
(4. 1 4 1 )Dani
Idi-ngat nab
I SG-see pigyem
eatdit-de
bikau
I SG-POS sw.potatoThis sentence can have two readings:
(i)I didn't see (that) the pig ate my sweet potatoes.(ii)I saw (that) the pig didn't eat my sweet potatoes.",[123]
"In other words, these two instances of negated purposive sequences yield conflicting results.
In (4. 1 47) 'hit pig die not', the preferred scope of negation concerns the result, i.e. V2,
whereas in (4. 1 48) '(x) draw water (y) drink not', the interpretation of the scope of negation
focuses on the first conjunct, and leaves the purpose in tact. It seems that the preferred
interpretation of the negative fluctuates with a purposive or a resultative reading of the
sequence.
4.5. 6. 6 Negation and speech verb + complementSimilarly, different interpretations of the scope of negation are possible for negative
sentences with a speech verb as main predicate. Consider:
(4. 1 49) (a) Noni 0-jem
da di-kwei
big
he
3SG-call me 1 SG-come not
He called me to come but I didn't come
19Hans Iwou interpretes (4. 1 46a) as That (means) one does not use a machete to fell the tree, but one uses
something else'. He also claims that (4. 1 46b), that is di·ba hamboi di·bi·wim biei nora di·wim big 'I took a
machete to fell the tree but 1 didn't fell it' should make a possibility or wish explicit, as in:

Disambiguation of examples (4. 1 4 1 ) and (4 . 1 42) is possible only on pragmatic grounds.
Not only negative sentences involving perception complements are semantically opaque. The
various verb sequences described in §4.S. 1 -§4.S.S allow similar multiple interpretations,
albeit that some interpretations are more easily available than others. Consider the following
examples: (i) adverbial, (ii) directional verb plus main, (iii) main verb plus directional, (iv)
instrumental, (v) resultative, (vi) speech and (vii) perception verbs with their complements
under negation.
4.5. 6 1 Negation and adverbial sequences(4. 1 43) (a) Munggwom dima i-pim
i-nggum
big,
child
that
3PL-cry 3PL-hungry not
Those children are not crying (because) they are hungry,
The scope of the negative can be shown by possible continuations of this sentence. Both
(4. 1 43b) and (4. 1 43c) are possible:
(4. 1 43) (b) noro i-pim
i-nggobiau.
but
3PL-cry 3PL-thirsty
but they are crying (because) they are thirsty.
(c) noro
i-pa .
but
3PL-Iaugh
but they are laughing.
Interpretation (b) is the most available one, which is not very surprising, considering the
pragmatics of negation. Universally, it is the adverbial (whether adverb or prepositional
phrase or subordinate clause) which is the first candidate for the scope of negation. She
doesn 't run fast has as its first interpretation 'she runs but not fast'. The logically possible
interpretation 'she doesn't run' is available, but less likely. Why would a speaker supply
more, modifying information about an event that s/he is going to negate anyway? Similar
hierarchies of interpretations are valid for the other negative sequences.
4.5. 62 Negation and directional sequences 0)This category comprises structures in which V I is a directional verb followed by an
unprefixed main verb:
(4. 1 44) (a) Yoni y-ug
bong ei
ig-bei
big,
they 3PL-go sleep LOC house-under not
They don't go (to) sleep in the house (at home),
can be followed by:Syntax1 09(b) nOTO y-ug

but
3PL-go sleep LOC forest
but they go to sleep in the forest.
(c) Zeu-o
yoni i-bong
ei
igbei
tu.
from-ALT they 3PL-sleep LOC house already
because they are already sleeping in the house.ls
Again, interpretation (b) is the first given when informants are asked what the negative
sentence means. But (c), which restricts the scope of negation to the directional verb, is
available.
4.5. 6.3 Negation and directional sequences (ii)This category is formed by structures in which a prefixed main verb is followed by an
unprefixed directional verb as V2:
(4. 1 4S) (a) Yoni i-krau
munggwom kwei
big.
they 3PL-hold child
come
not
They don't bring the child(ren). (lit. They don't hold the child(ren) hither.)
Sentence (4. 1 4Sa) has as its first reading simply: 'They don't holdlkeep the children, so the
children stay where they are', but it can be felicitously followed by either (b) or (c):
(b) Noro i-krau
munggwom
ug.
but
3PL-hold child
go
Take the children away. (lit. But they hold the children thither.)
(c) Munggwom pima
yo-nti
i-kwei.
child
that
they-self 3PL-come
The children come of their own accord.
In other words, the preferred interpretation of the scope of negation is the whole clause or
the expansion: they may hold the children or not, but at least they are not coming towards the
deictic centre. The second interpretation, namely that negation applies only to the first
predicate and does not involve the direction, is definitely available, as (4. 1 4Sb) shows.
4.5. 6. 4 Negation and instrumental sequencesNegation of a sequence involving an Instrument, as in example (4. 1 46a), has as its first
reading that the scope is restricted to the Instrument. Thus, (b) is the most likely continuation:
(4. 1 46) (a) Di-ba
hamboi di-bi-wim
biei
l SG-use machete l SG-INS-fell tree
I did not fell the tree with a machete,18big,
notInformants rejected ei igbei su for (4. 1 44c), in contrast to what I would have expected on the basis of the
general morpho-phonological rule for tu/su. Perhaps some similar distinction as was described for silti in
§4.4.6 is at play here.","[123, 124, 125]"

notBased upon this information, the conclusion can be drawn that example (4.83a) specifies that
the hiding is done in a quick manner, whereas in (4.8 3b) and (4.8 3c) the adverb is more
sentential: the action followed quickly on some earlier event.
Similarly, the adverbs bu 'again' and cem 'also' may take various positions according to
the required scope. Consider some examples of cem. In (4.86) cem only has the subject dani
'I' in its scope, in (4.87) the predicate with object is focused on, and in (4. 8 8) it is just the
object dihyei 'ground' which is included as a further possible goal of what one can pay for
with kain timur 'ceremonial cloth'.

We used (kain timur) to buy ground also (in addition to paying for
transgressions and to buy women). [Kain timur:037]Adverbial phrases or clauses which set the time (see §4 .4. 1 ) are either in initial position as
part of the clause, or they are actually outside the clause proper and linked to the main clause
by a clausal conjunction. In (4.48) above we saw an example with lene 'and, then'; here is
one with api 'then, subsequently':

The next day then we ate (it) until it was finished. [Hans: 1 1 ]Adverbs that are always clause-final are the aspectual tulsu 'already' and the negatives. See
next section for interaction between these two.
4.4.9 Position of negativeHatam has two negatives: big 'not' for negation of declaratives and interrogatives, and au
'don't' (in Indonesian janga n) for imperatives. Both negative adverbs are always in clause­
final position. Only question particles e or i may follow.

"I have no information on a possible reading 'He called me not to come'. I suspect (4. 1 50)
would allow this more than (4. 1 5 1 ).
Clearly, there are some interesting phenomena here that deserve further investigation.
4.5. 6. 7 Negation and perception verb + complementIn the case of perception verbs with complements, both readings of the negative are
equally available. However, the preferred scope of negation, as indicated by the first
translation given by informants, is the main predicate, as in reading (a) of (4. 1 52):

"Introduction71 .4 Data collection and presentationThis grammar is based on data collected during two short periods of fieldwork, 1 5
October-30 November 1 994 and 8 November- I I December 1 99 5 , in M inyambou, in the
kecamatan Warmare, Kabupaten Manokwari, Bird's Head, Irian Jaya. These periods were
too short to afford extensive trekking through the area in order to obtain data on dialectal
differences. Instead, I stayed in Minyambou and collected word lists there and in adjacent
Mbenti. From a few speakers I obtained texts from the oral tradition. But I also recorded a
long personal narrative (Yoas Wonggor from Mbenti) and a sermon, given by Habel Iwou in
the church at Minyambou. These narratives in natural speech could be checked and
elaborated on with the excellent help from the principal of the primary school at M inyambou,
Hans Iwou. The dictionaries compiled by Dick Griffiths allowed me fast access to the
vocabulary of Hatam. A first result of this research was published as 'Explorations in Bert's
Head: Hatam' in Baak et al. ( 1 995).
Having done some preliminary analysis on this material I returned to the Hatam area in
the fall of 1 995 to verify and increase my data. A few other texts were recorded, some
myths, a short historical account of events during the Second World War, and two short texts
about 'slave'-trade in the Eastern Bird's Head.
In order to test phonological problems, a number of short sentences with contrasting items
were pronounced by three different speakers, who were prompted in Indonesian. In order to
investigate the status of verb sequences I took sentences from the recorded texts, changed
them into a negative, or a relative construction, manipulated presence or absence of certain
affixation, and asked native speakers what these sentences meant in I ndonesian, or whether
they could be used in a particular situation. The result of this method is that most examples in
this grammar are taken from natural speech, but that the discussion on relative clause and
scope of negation relies more heavily on elicited material. As much as possible, especially
where deemed significant to stress natural language use, I have indicated in brackets from
which recorded text an example is taken. The text references include texts which have not
been included in this volume.
Throughout this volume I attempt to follow, as much as possible, the established
orthography as employed in the published Hatam material, such as the New Testament. The
most obvious discrepancy concerns the spelling of the negative. I n the established
orthography this is bi 'not', but since I believe the word resembles items spelled with final -ig
(for example, often a noticeable friction following the high vowel-see §2.3 for further
details), I have chosen for the spelling big.
In spite of the additional information obtained during my second visit to Minyambou,
many questions remain. In particular, the extent of the phonemic status of geminate
consonants cannot be unequivocally stated. Likewise, the status of various elements described
in the morphology and syntax is rather dubious. This is no surprise, of course, considering
that my analysis is based on fieldwork of only eleven weeks. In a sense, it could be
considered to be rather presumptuous to attempt to write a grammar on the basis of such a
short exposure to a language. While I was in the process of revising an earlier version of this
grammar, an even more presumptuous account of the language was published.
Based on a short trip, Donohue ( 1 997) published a Hatam phonology and grammatical
notes. He does not recognise high vowels in the language, nor any contrast between single and
geminate consonants. He also posits a series of labio-velar consonants, for which there is no
evidence. His ykpe 'house' refers to a compound ig-bei 'house-under'. There are quite a few
data in his paper which show the typical misunderstandings a first survey invariably contains.
For example, he identifies the nasal in nggwen 'sick' and kney 'bad' as the same element,8Ger P. Reesinksignalling a strong denial. In fact, there are no other items that relate in the same way as kei
'good' and kanei 'bad' , which suggests that the formal similarity is just accidental. The word
for 'sick', nggwen, is one of many that begin with a homorganic nasal, but gwen does not
exist, as far as I know. So far, a semantic constant between lexical items that differ only in
the presence or absence of an initial homorganic nasal could not be established. To be fair, it
may be that his data are from a different dialect, spoken near the Anggi lakes, which may
have a Beneficiary marker yp, or a coreferential subject marking prefix ho. In the Tinam
dialect, I have not found anything that suggests a particular morphology to indicate
something like a switch-reference mechanism. This is not the place to make an evaluation of
every item in Donohue's paper. The value of a description depends to a degree on the time
one has been exposed to a language. In other words, the present work too may contain a
number of misunderstandings and wrong analyses, which may show up after a more thorough
acquaintance with the language.
This monograph does not pretend to give more than a preliminary description of Hatam
and I have refrained from extensive discussions of a theoretical nature. This applies in
particular to the phonology, which at first glance appeared to be quite simple, but does
contain a number of problematic issues related to the stress pattern. In the area of syntax , a
theoretical discussion regarding serial verb constructions is avoided. I have simply tried to
arrange my data in such a way that some arguments bearing on that topic can find some
corroboration. Following the chapters on phonology and grammar, I present a few texts, with
annotations.","[22, 23, 24]"
"112Ger P. ReesinkThe point of all these examples is to illustrate that, although some structures seem to
prefer one interpretation of scope of negation over others, they are all inherently opaque. This
seems to be a necessary consequence of the nature of negation, especially in a language such
as Hatam where the position of the negative adverb is rigidly sentence-final. Thus, scope of
negation cannot give evidence about the status of these constructions. Whereas the sequences
involving directional verbs have morphological indications that they are different from
coordinated constructions (that is, if the purposive bi- qualifies as a coordinating conjunction)
or constructions involving complement clauses, negation operates in a similar way on all of
them.
4.6 Relative clausesHatam allows relativisation on all syntactic constituents of the clause. The head noun
(HN) is always preposed and referenced by a relative marker at the beginning of the relative
clause (RC). The relative marker that links HN with RC is di JdV -J, which can also be used
with demonstratives and adjectives. In the latter case there is a distinction between straight
attributive adjectives and those linked by di. Let us first look at the simple NP constructions.
(4. 1 54) (a) wou cun
pima
snake short that
the short snake
(b) wou di
cun
pima
snake REL short that
the snake which is shortAs we saw (§3 . 5 ; §4. 1 .2), adjectives allow the 3SG.POS prefix ni- in both predicative and
attributive position, while verbs do not. Thus, a similar contrast as between (4. 1 54a) and
(4. 1 54b) exists for possessed adjectives:
(4. 1 55) (a) wou ni-cun
pima
snake 3SG-short that
that short one of a snake
(b) wou di
nl-cun
pima
snake REL 3SG-short that
the snake which is a short oneThe structures of (4. 1 5 5) are not possible for verbs; (4. 1 5 6a) is ungrammatical. But the
relative clause may be introduced by di- or a compound of relative marker and third person
pronoun no, as in (4. 1 56b).

"With the preposition leu 'from' the Topic marker ne expresses temporal sequence 'after
that' or 'then', which is reduced to the ubiquitous lene 'and (then)'; see §3 . 1 5.
3.12 Question words
3. 12. 1 Polar question markersPolar questions can be formed without any overt morphological marking, as long as the
intonation is rising. But generally, either of two question markers, e or i, is used. Both
question markers are utterance-final clitics. The marker i (which is homophonous, if not
identical, to the element 'yes' = i or iyo, presumably 'yes' + 0 'inclusive disjunction') seems to
be the more general, since it also occurs on content questions.
The difference between -e and - i lies in expectations on the part of the speaker.
Informants characterised the contrast in terms of e requiring a quick answer and i marking
questions in general. When a positive -i.e. agreeing-answer is expected, -e is used, as in
examples (3. 1 47) and (3 . 1 4 8).
(3 . 1 47)A -ngkek
dut e?
2SG-skin hot Q
You are hot, aren't you?",[84]
"For consequences on possible interpretations of negative sentences, see §4.S.6.
3.14 Verbal adjunctsThere are two elements, kep and ser, whose meaning is not easily captured. Inasmuch as
they modify verbs they could be considered to be adverbs. But their syntactic behavior and
semantic impact is such that I discuss them separately as verbal adjuncts. Griffiths ( 1 994:27)
lists two entries for kep: one as an adverb, meaning 'in due time, eventually', another as a
preposition meaning 'on, upon, back'. He also gives two entries for ser: a verb with the
meaning 'to pry out, remove with fingernail as dirt from eyeball or lesion' and another as
preposition, glossed as 'inhibitive morpheme' . Since I have no evidence on a verb-like ser, I
will discuss the uninflected elements only, which I identify as kep having a general meaning74Ger P. Reesinkof 'keep onto' and ser meaning 'keeping OUt'. 12 For example, with the verb krau 'grab' the
adjunct kep conveys the meaning of 'holding onto':

ingmuig.
Kwanding grab keep.onto gourd
Kwanding held on to the gourd.","[89, 90]"

4.5.5 GeneraljuxtapositionAs the examples in the introduction to this section show, juxtaposition of verbal predicates
is not restricted to the Directional, Instrumental, Purposive and Perception/Speech
complements. As far as I can tell, juxtaposition of verbal predicates -with or without explicit
object NPs in the case of transitive verbs -always involves a same subject sequence. This
'rule' excludes perception and speech verbs as V I , as we have seen. Secondly, juxtaposed
verbs are always both marked with a subject prefix, when applicable. This 'rule' excludes
i) verbs immediately following Directional verbs, ii) Directional verbs specifying direction for
main verbs and iii) optionally, V2's of Instrumental sequences. But even juxtaposedSyntax1 07directional verbs can be prefixed, as can be seen in i-nang y-ug 'they fled and went' in
[Yairus 2:067] (see footnote 1 1 above), and in another instance of intransitive verbs in series:

Mbingwam.
3SG-stop block LOC Mbingwam
After the two women had walked and come, he blocked them off at
Mbingwam. [Anggos 033]Some sequences of intransitive verbs could be interpreted as V2 being an adverbial
modifier of V I . Such sequences do not allow an intervening conjunction ba 'and', as shown
by example (4.96), repeated here as (4. 1 3 8); (4. 1 3 8b) is unacceptable.

ni-nggum . . .

(b)*
ni-harabani-nggumSequences of transitive verbs are simply tight temporal sequences, which in contrast with
'adverbial sequences' can easily be conjoined by ba 'and':

njinta (ba) i-biak
yok.
3PL-take food
(and) 3PL-host them
They take food (and) host (= put on a big meal) them. [Dowansiba 06 1 ]4.5. 6 Scope of negationAs mentioned in §4.4.9, the negative adverb big (as well as negative imperative au) is
always in clause-final position. I should say rather that it occurs sentence-finally, because, as
seen in example (4. 1 3 1 ) above, negation of a perception verb is effected by big following the
complement clause. It is ungrammatical to have the negative in between the main predicate
and its complement:
(4. 1 40)*Dani di-ngat big
nab yem dit-de
siep.
I
I SG-see not
pig eat
I SG-POS sw.potato
I didn't see that the pig ate my sweet potatoes.","[121, 122, 123]"
"Thus, the first interpretation of (4. 1 47) is 'I hit the pig but it didn't die'. However, 'I didn't hit
the pig, but it died of another cause' is also possible. On the other hand, for the negative
sentence (4. 1 48), the preferred interpretation is 'They didn't draw water for me to drink'.
(4. 1 48)I-tau
minyei hi
bi-di-dut
big.
3PL-draw water some PUR- 1 SG-drink not
They didn't draw water for me to drink.",[126]
"(3 . 1 4 1 )Igbit rio
true
GIV
It's true. (= amen, after a prayer)Thus, even though givenness is involved in examples (3. 1 37) and (3. 1 3 8), there is also a
sense of assertion conveyed by ri, as illustrated by (3 . 1 39)-(3 . 1 40). It is as if a speaker wants
to convey 'I consider the preceding element or constituent as given and I want to make this
explicit by my assertion'. Such a general meaning seems to be part of a complex conjunction
as gi-ma-ri-no 'NOM-that-GIV-3SG', which is adequately glossed as 'therefore (then)', as in
(3. 1 42). This example contains another instance of its use in utterance-final position.

Therefore then, we live at mount Arfak, at the foot, at the foot of mount
Arfak. [Wonggor 2 :030]These examples by no means exhaust the possible contexts in which ri is used. But they
give an idea of the elusive meaning it has in the functional domain of 'asserted givenness'.
3. 1 1.2 Topic marker neThe form ne is identified as Topic marker. But again, the exact meaning is not easily
defined. In some cases, it seems to imply some contrastive function. Since ne can mark both
nominal and pronominal subjects (3. 1 43) and conditional clauses (3 . 1 44), the rather vague
term 'topic' seems appropriate enough. The constituent marked by n e is a frame, a
background for the ensuing statement.",[83]

position, they can also occur in other positions, as seen in example (3. 1 79). The negative

75. 1 70 1 00 200 msecThe first speaker, Yakonias, has more 'pauses', i.e. periods of no voicing, between the
morphemes. The second speaker, Yulius, inserts a schwa between the subject noun biged and
the predicate but, which resyllabifies [b<}.g£.d<}.but]. Yakonias' but.big forms a iamb even
though both syllables are of equal length. Likewise, Yulius' big ba forms a iamb. Significant
is that both instances of iambs last about 300 msec. Interestingly, the verb but 'fall (of rain)'
fonns the trough in the first example and the peak in the second one. Similarly, the negative
adverb is peak in the first, trough in the second one. The duration of these syllables is roughly
the same. But as the wave fonns in Figure 2.2 show, the lack of difference in length appears
to be compensated either by intensity, as the iamb [bi.ba] in the second example, or by pitch,
as [but.bi] in the first example. A preliminary conclusion would be, then, that Hatam fonns a
iambic metrum based on length: short-long. In case of syllables of roughly equal length, the
peak is phonetically realised by intensity or pitch.",[51]

Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) priority programme 'The Irian Jaya Studies: a
Programme for Interdisciplinary Research' (ISIR), financed by the Netherlands Foundation
for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). The programme is carried out in
cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, The Indonesian Institute of
Sciences).
I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan
Bahasa (National Centre for Language Development), for his willingness to be the sponsor of
the linguistic studies carried out under the auspices of ISIR.
In order to study the Hatam language in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya I also needed
and readily obtained permission from the authorities in Jayapura, Irian Jaya, and more
specifically in the regency (Kabupaten) Manokwari. I thank the heads of Sospol (Direktorat
Jenderal Sosial Politik) and Bappeda (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah) for
their permission.
But with just the permission and support of the governmental authorities it is hard to study
a regional language such as Hatam. During my first visit to Manokwari, Rogier Gruys gave
me many useful suggestions about whom I should contact. So, before I even travelled to
Hatam territory, I visited the office of World Wide Fund for Nature, where various Hatam
speakers were employed. The director, Daud Womsiwor, arranged for me to meet with
Yohanes Wonggor and Marinus Mandacan, both from Mokwam. They taught me a few
useful expressions in Hatam, and supplied me with a letter in Hatam about regulations for the
nature reserve. Yohanes read it on tape and gave me the meaning in Indonesian.
In Minyambou I was welcomed by the missionaries of The Evangelical Alliance Mission,
Dick and Char Griffiths and Walter and Dianne Kennedy. My thanks are due to them for
their hospitality and their help. The TEAM director in Manokwari, Elmer Lorenz, graciously
allowed me to use the organization's address and infrastructure to keep in contact with people
in my home country.
There is no way to learn a language without native speakers willing to teach. Many Hatam
people have been very friendly and helpful. They were willing to tell stories, which I recorded
and transcribed, or just provided words or sentences which I needed in order to make progress
with my analysis. Thanks are due to: andigpoi Tuantiei Dowansiba, and Yoas Wonggor,
Yoas Iwou, Yairus Dowansiba, Erens Morum, Isak Mandacan, Esap Iwou. In particular, the
texts from Tuantiei were not always easy to understand. Hans Iwou, principal of the primary
school in Minyambou, was a patient and astute teacher. He not only helped me understandxiiAcknowledgementsthese difficult texts, but also was able to answer my many questions regarding morphological
and syntactic complexities. When he was not at Minyambou during my second visit in 1 995,
I found his cousins Yakonias Iwou and Yoas Iwou willing to help me with my questions. But
Hans Iwou, living then at Maruni, could again answer some remaining questions, when I
returned from Minyambou to Manokwari in December 1 995.
Finally, I want to express my thanks to two anonymous referees and Bert Voorhoeve for
commenting on a first draft. In particular, Bert had gone through the manuscript with a fine­
tooth comb, and made many valuable suggestions. I want to thank Jelle Miedema, Dianne
van Oosterhout and Leontine Visser for comments on an earlier version of the
anthropological notes in the Introduction. I have benefited from comments by Harry van der
Hulst and Ian Maddieson on the phonology chapter. Cecilia Ode has helped me with the
measurements and printing the spectograms. None of these people are, of course, responsible
for the flaws that remain.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"Another example of indirect speech employs the prefixed QUOTE marker bi-pia, which I
interpret as an instance of the instrument prefix, since a purposive would be followed by
subject prefix (if/when applicable)'7:

(If) we inquire that he show us their exact place of origin, they will show (it) to

bi-pia . Compare the direct and indirect speech variants of the event 'pig bites youlher' in
examples (4. 1 34a) and (4. 1 34b), both unelicited, taken from the Kwanding myth:
1617This sentence can also mean 'I know that my daughter does not love that man'. For further discussion of
scope of negative see §4.5.6. For ngon ngakei 'love' see §3.4.5.
In example (4. 1 33) it could be that third person plural has disappeared through assimilation. But if the
subject were first person singular, for example, one would get:
di-hig ser bi-pia.. . and not: *di-hig ser bi-di-pia.",[121]

area. He pauses and repairs quite a few times. He finally decides to say that the cloths reached the area
through (the compound tug han is explained as melalui 'through the means, according to') the East
Indonesians. They were the ones who made them.
I take it that the subject of this clause refers to the people of Timur 'the East' who sold their cloths off to
others, such as the Hatam. The verb tri is used for 'selling' or 'delivering' a speech, while the antonym is
expressed by pek 'buy', 'acquire', 'reach'. Thus, the prepositional object i-tri leu )!Q!1i has the same referent
as the subject, see rules for reflexivity, §3. 1 .
As Hatam equivalents for this Indonesian term, the speaker suggested -yai-kep-ti 'takeJdo-keep.onto-NOM'
or ninsinati 'method, way of doing things' (presumably, this is polymorphemic as well, but not as
transparent as the former term).
This phrase is phonetically realised as (nyentandikpoinya). There are more speakers who pronounce first
plural possessive with a prenasalised alveolar stop which may be voiced or voiceless, but not aspirated: [nye­
nde) or [nye-nte).",[221]
"67l. .;>QAlthough in examples (3 . 1 37) and (3 . 1 38) ri, functioning like a copula, can be seen as

the same import as, for example, 'it is' in English cleft sentences.

Thereupon she stretched out her hand (and) with it she took a ripe sweet potato

(4. 1 1 3) and (4. 1 1 4), but when it is given as a single N(P), linked to the main clause by ba
'and' or lene 'then', the main verb is obligatorily marked with an instrument affix:

(I had) one shotgun and with that I shot hawks and so on ... [Wonggor 1 :030]The Instrument prefix is liable to 'excessive use' by some speakers. That is, even when no
instrument has been mentioned in the preceding context, main verbs may be prefixed with bi­
to signal that an instrument is understood, as in:

4.5.3 Purposive verb sequencesIn contrast to Directional and Instrumental constructions, Purposives can be characterised
as Different Subject sequences. In many instances the sequence labeled 'purposive' can also
be interpreted as 'resultative', especially when the utterance refers to a past event, as in
example (4. 1 1 7). Later we will see that negation may sometimes favour a resultative
interpretation, and at other times a purposive one. In many cases the subject of the purposive
or resultative verb is the object of the first verb. Whether the result is expressed by a verb, as
in (4. 1 1 7), or an adjective, as in (4. 1 1 8), in both cases it needs to be marked with the
purposive clitic.'5 The (b) variants are unacceptable.
(4. 1 1 7) (a) Di-bui
napia
bi-mai.
I SG-hit wild.pig PUR-die
I killed the wild pig. (lit. I hit the wild pig dead.)
14Note that no '3SG' is part of the bimorphemic conjunction api-no, which conveys a slightly stronger sense
of (con-)sequence than api. Recall that third person singular has a zero subject prefix, hence the various
verbs in (4. 1 1 4) are all uninflected. Perhaps better: only bi-yai is uninflected, while the other verbs are
covertly inflected as revealed by another person category:

tham
I stretched my hand and with it I got a ripe sweet potato and gave it to them.
This clitic may be a weakened form of the preposition bak 'to, for', as suggested in §3.2.6. There are also
sentences where it seems to be interchangeable with the connective ba 'and'. To add another conjecture,
these two may well be related historically, if the elision of the final consonant is comparable to that of the
pronominal forms nok and yok to no and yo.","[117, 118]"

77The occurrence of the nominaliser gi before kui is strange here. It could be that a velar stop of kikau(g)
surfaces, connected with a schwa to the following verb mbut.
The free translation is motivated by the following observations: (i) ni-kan-kan was first explained as kami
tidak tahu 'we don't know', but no negative element is present; (ii) ni-nyai-si, which contains the word nyai
'other bank of a river' was explained as akhir bumi, tunjung bumi 'end (of) world, cape (of) world'. Clearly,
the narrator means something like: 'we don't know exactly where this mythical hero went, but it must have
been way beyond our familiar world'.",[184]
"The Q-word tou is the basis for questions after 'who', 'how', 'where' and 'which'.
Questions about human identity use tou 'who', which in subject position seems t o require the

"Even if pragmatically some meanings are less likely, negation of main verb or
complement is equally possible for such constructions. For example, (4. 1 4 1 ), repeated as

"Syntax1234. 7. 1.2 lene 'and then 'The conjunction lene indicates somewhat stronger a linear sequence between two
conjuncts than ba. There are many instances of .billh same and subject sequences marked by
lene in narrative texts, as illustrated by examples (4. 1 98) and (4. 1 99).

Then we touched (it) and then the cuscus scrambled away. [Wonggor 1 :020]In §4.S.2 we have seen Instruments being linked to the main clause by means of ba. In
narratives it is mainly lene that is found in this function. Either a nominal instrument, as in
(4.200), or a time phrase (4.20 1 ), is given and linked to the main clause by lene:

justThe clearest evidence for contrast between neutral addition of ba and sequentiality of lene
is the fact that I have not found ba as introduction of apodosis of conditionals or temporal
contingencies. This is always done by lene (or the even stronger sequential api), as in:

4. 7. 1.2. 1 Combinations with leneGiven the meaning of lene as opposed to ba, namely that a stronger sense of sequentiality
is involved, it is not surprising to find lene combined with other elements to express notions
such as 'after', 'after a while', 'before' and 'so then'. Such combinations are not possible with
ba .
The phasal aspect marker tulsu on the first conjuct, followed by lene expresses 'after the
first event, the second', as in:1 24Ger P. Reesink(4.203)Noni

The general clause formula gives the most common word order. However, other word
orders are possible. Hatam does allow (oblique) objects to be preposed, or time adverbials in
clause-final position. Adverbs are possible at various positions throughout the clause, except
between verb and direct object. These options will be shown when I discuss each clause
constituent in §4.4. But first the general structure of the noun phrase, with comments on its
constituents, will be presented in §4. 1 . Section 4.2 will illustrate non-verbal predications,
which are not covered by the general clause formula. Another construction that does not
correspond to the verbal clause involves impersonal predicates. This will be presented in §4.3.
A rather striking feature of Hatam is its prolific use of asyndetic verb sequences. Since this
phenomenon is pertinent to the issue of serial verb constructions, I will discuss various
combinations of predications and the scope of negation which they allow in some detail in
§4.5. Relative clauses with their possible head nouns are dealt with in §4.6. This chapter will
close with a presentation of clause combinations in §4 .7, according to the conjunctions as
given in §3 . 1 5 .

already3.11 Textual deixisThere are two monosyllabic words that are best described as having some function in
textual deixis. That is, they function in the domain of givenness and topichood or even
emphasis, contrast and focus. But these terms are not easily defined, and none of them seem
to be an adequate label for either ri or ne. Yet, for want of better terms, I have chosen GIVen
as gloss for ri, and TOPic for ne. Both of these words may carry stress.
3. 1 1. 1 Given marker riThe 'given marker' ri is used in a variety of contexts, but it always determines the
preceding constituent. In example (3 . 1 37), which are possible answers to the question where
something is located, it links the preceding pronoun to the following demonstrative.

"32Ger P. Reesinkof fkI versus JgJ. Secondly, I have alternative realisations of words like JdVgoJ 'to cut up', as
in [t;:)go] and [d;:)go]. Thirdly, no geminates are found as onset of a weak syllable.
I suspect that weak syllables may be realised with either voiced consonants, as in example
(2.5 6), or voiceless ones. I am rather cautious in making firm statements, because my
fieldwork was limited to Minyambou, where the two dialects Miriei and Tinam meet. It
seems that Miriei has less voicing than Tinam. Perhaps the contrast in voicing is in the
process of disappearing in Miriei faster than in Tinam. While I have no instances of [b;:)ley]
for pilei 'to shoot', my recordings do have a realisation of [p;:)IJgas] for IbVnggasJ 'goanna' by
a recognised Tinam speaker; see. example (2.60).
2.10 Metrical stressAll lexical items, whether monosyllabic or polysyllabic, allow stress marking, including
CV verbs, such as jo 'be somewhere', ku 'to hide'; nouns, such as b u 'nettle leaf', mo
'shrimp' ; adverbs, such as bu 'again' , and function words, such as ei 'at; to' and ba 'and'.
As mentioned with regard to bisyllabic words, the first syllable is never stressed, except in
two instances. Firstly, the suffix -ni on personal pronouns can never receive stress. Thus dani
'1', nyeni 'we' are never [da. 'ni] or [fie . 'ni]. Secondly, the clitic -a on citation forms of nouns
may never receive stress:
(2.57)

guri-aJig-aJ
Jsar-aJhouse-IND
lattice-IND[nu. 'IJu.gwa]
[gu. 'ri.ya]=
=['iy.ya]
['sa.ra]mountain
chickenNotice that I formulated the stress rule for words in isolation in negative terms. Whereas
suffixed pronouns and monosyllabic nouns show a trochaic pattern, bisyllabic words with or
without a final clitic suggest a iambic pattern. But when these words occur in running speech,
no rule can positively specify which syllable should be assigned stress. Only negatively, first
syllables of polysyllabic words (whether mono- or poly morphemic) can never be stressed,
suggesting a phrasal iambic metrical stress. Accent in Hatam cannot be stated in terms of
word pattern. It is related to a whole utterance or phrasal part thereof. Following a pause, or a
single long syllable, such as the connective ba 'and', a trough comes (almost) always first, as
in:

always have the first syllable stressed: da-ni 'I-this' etc.
The sequence of iambs in Hatam seems to be quite regular and gives a distinctive
rhythmic impression. A sequence of bisyllabic words in an NP maintains stress on words of
different classes in the following:Phonology33(2.60)

Content words, like monosyllabic verbs or nouns, do not necessarily attract stress. It
apparently depends on the overall pattern in the clause. For example, in (2.6 1 ), which
answers the question where a certain item can be found, [no.jo] forms the first iamb, with /jo/
being the peak.

In the early days in this area, we didn't have kain timur. [Kain tirnur:006]Similarly, the verb coi 'enter' receives primary stress in a .coi kwei 'you-enter come' for
'come in !', whereas in example (2.6 1 ) it forms the trough before the peak on the preposition
ei:

The goanna fled and slid into the water. [Hans:004]
Note that in example (2.63) there is a long pause following the connective ba 'and', which
itself appears to be outside the regular iambic pattern. Between the subject noun binggas and
the verb nang a schwa is produced. The new syllable takes the coda from the preceding one
as its onset. It is not clear whether this is a weak realisation of the citation marker a, or just
an epenthetic vowel to solve the stress clash. I suspect the former, since the strong syllable of
a mono- or bisyllabic lexical item can easily be weakened to form the trough of a iamb, as
illustrated in the next examples. The opposite, strengthening a weak syllable to an iambic
peak, seems to be much less preferred. But there is no ban on it, as jo bi-nyeni in (2.62)
shows. As already pointed out with respect to polysyllabic words, it is quite possible to have
an upbeat consisting of two or three short syllables. Consider the phonetic realisation of
(2.64), which illustrates a series of weak syllables in ni-pilei ' l EXC-shoot' and a weakening
of a monosyllabic lexical item hab 'bird'. The figures under each syllable give the duration in
milliseconds, taking the onset of the pertinent consonants as boundaries.","[47, 48, 49]"

Mipong was one of a group who did it.
The compound -ya kep means 'to be occupied with something for quite some time, with considerable effort'.
Hatam has two words that are translated as 'finished': ngwig means 'depleted' (Indonesian habis) and put
means 'completed' (Indonesian selesai). Ngwig is used to express the notion that 'there were no gardens left
to do'.",[206]
"16Ger P. Reesink2.3 Final stopsWord-finally, the palatal stops do not occur. For the other stops the voiced-voiceless
contrast is neutralised. I will give evidence for stops of three places of articulation:
(i)Regarding bilabial stops, in one sentence one may find: [m�mbron� mem sop>]
'brideprice for woman', immediately followed by [atau ibuwak> soph] 'or they marry
women'. Nouns in citation form are always 'suffixed' with the vowel -a, whether they
end in vowel or consonant. In that context, no noun 'ends' with a voiceless stop, which
gives [sob-a] 'woman' as citation form. Thus IsoPI 'woman' is realised with (a) an
unreleased voiceless bilabial stop or (b) a released voiceless one preceding a pause, or
(c) a voiced bilabial stop preceding a vowel.(ii)As for alveolar stops, the verb IngaTI 'to see' is realised as [I)at] utterance-finally in:

"3 Morphology3.0 IntroductionThis chapter gives the word classes that appear necessary for a description of Hatam. This
language, like the languages that are claimed to constitute the West-Papuan Phylum, has a
rather limited morphology. Inalienable nouns and verbs are prefixed to index person-number
of possessor and subject. To facilitate the treatment of nouns and verbs, I will first discuss
the personal pronouns. There are a number of clitics which apply either to lexical items or to
clausal constituents. These will be presented before the other word classes are discussed. The
way some of the clitics operate on different word classes can then be described in the
appropriate sections. This chapter then, will provide all the 'building blocks' which are
needed to account for the syntactic structures to be discussed in Chapter 4. In general I will
use the established orthography. At times, when necessary, phonetic realisations will be
specified.
3.1 PronounsAlthough the pronominal prefixes have already been given in §2.6, they are here repeated,
in Table 3 . 1 , to show their relationship with the free forms and other pronominal forms. Here
I employ the established orthography. Recall that the vowel in the prefixes when following a
consonant is the unspecified vowel, most frequently realised as [;:>]. Most prefixes are clearly
related to the free pronouns.
Table 3.1 : Personal pronounsFreePrefixPossessiveEmphaticExclusiveI SGdadi-dit-de*da-ntida-ngkom2SGnaa-a-dena-ntina-ngkom3SGno(k)0; ni-ni-deno-ntino-ngkoml INCnyei(g)-i-denye-ntinye-ngkomnye-ntinye-ngkomje-ntije-ngkoml EXCnyeni-nyen-de/ni-de *2PLjeji-ji-deMorphologyFreePrefixPossessiveEmphaticExclusive3PLyork)i(g)-i-deyo-ntiyo-ngkom1 DUsasi-si-desa-ntisa-ngkom41* The morphophonology of possessive pronouns leaves some questions: most forms clearlyhave a voiced alveolar stop and stress on the second syllable. Native speakers insist that first
singular is dit-de, realised phonetically as [dgtE], which contrasts with an aspirated alveolar
voiceless stop in dete = [dgthE] 'my side'. Likewise nye-nde is realised as [nyente], without
aspiration. Possibly, some remnant of possessive linker is still present in some forms (see also
kinship terms as inalienable nouns in §3.3 . 1 ).
In most instances the free pronouns are suffixed with -ni: dani, nani, noni, nyeni, jeni,
yoni, and sani. The suffix is identical to the near deictic ni 'this', possibly derived from it and
bleached of its deictic meaning. It is not quite clear which factors determine the distribution
of short and long free pronouns. Subject position seems to prefer the suffixed form, as in
example (3. 1 ), and (oblique) object position seems to favour the short forms, as in (3.2). But
this is certainly not a strict rule, as (3.3) shows.

"See also §3 . 1 1 . 1 and §4.2.
3.13 AdverbsThe category of adverbs can be divided into a few subclasses, based on possible syntactic
position. Not all possible positions have been checked for all adverbs, so the present
classification is only preliminary. Although certain adjectives, such as kei 'good', kinei 'bad',
jei 'long' and cun 'short may be used adverbially, adverbs do form a separate class in that
they cannot be inflected, nor can they function as head of a noun phrase. Adverbs modify
predicates or whole clauses; some can function within a noun phrase as modifier of the
adjective or quantifier.
3. 13. 1 Time adverbsA number of mono morphemic words indicate a time reference. They are normally found
either in clause-initial position (example 3 . 1 6 5) or pre-predicate position (3 . 1 66).
Occasionally they may be found clause-finally. This position was explicitly rejected for sindi
'recently', but allowed for sisip 'all the while', as in (3 . 1 67).

4. 7. 1 . 4 Series of conjunctionsThat api has more of a semantic factor 'consequence' can also be deduced from the fact
that both ba and lene occur preceding api. Such a sequence does not form a compound
conjunction, but rather a repair to a more explicit indication of sequence or consequence. In

4. 7.2 Contrastive conjunctionsHatam has two conjunctions, which are morphologically related, to express a contrastive
relation between two clauses. The basic form is lo, which, combined with the third person
pronoun no, gives noro 'but'. Recall that Hatam does not have a phonemic contrast between
[r] and [1]. Nevertheless, I have encountered neither [nolo] nor [co].
4. 7.2. 1 Counterexpectation 10The qualification of 'counterexpectation' is given to the conjunction lo, because in

cliticises to the preceding verb, just as ri forms a phonological unit with its preceding nominal
constituent. Its position and function are reminiscent of deictic elements in Papuan languages

Although these nominalisations correlate with the possible constructions already given in
§ 3 . 2 . 3 , this analysis does not seem to account for the facts presented in examples

phrase, or clause. My data are not sufficient to give an adequate explanation in terms of such
a solution.
Locative phrases apparently can be preposed, just as direct objects. They are outside the

"The (a) variant of example (3.69) implies 'I am not presently lying on the mat '; the (b)
variant says: 'I'm right on the mat'. The position and motion verbs with direct object seem to
convey a progressive or habitual aspect. Further discussion will follow in §4 . 4.6.
3. 4.5 Verbs of emotion,
Emotions are expressed in Hatam by phrases of the inalienable noun -ngon 'heart 6 plus an
adjective, a verb, or an element that appears not to function separately anymore in the
language. Just a few examples are given in (3.70). For an extensive list, see Griffiths
( 1 994:49-52).

Reflexivity is cancelled by determining the object pronoun by means of a demonstrative

30The construction with the Indonesian loan ma-bisa was corrected with the Hatam bit-bon 'follow-make',
expressing 'capability'.
Whereas in (55) ni-ngkeg 'its-skin' is the object of cug, here ni-nnan 'its (shedded) skin' seems to be subject
of this same verb. It could be that cug 'remove' has two valencies, like for example dahat 'break'.
Alternatively, the object is pre-posed in this clause. Although Hatam is a rather strict (S)OV language, it is
possible to have an OV order; cf. (40) and (45) above.",[160]

"2Ger P. Reesink1.2 Hatam and its linguistic neighboursHatam is spoken by approximately 1 6,000 people living in the Arfak mountains, south of
Manokwari in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. According to Griffiths ( 1 994
and pers.comm.), the language comprises five dialects: Tinam, Miriei (or Moille, as in
Craven and De Fretes 1 98 7 ; Moile in Tim PSL Uncen 1 989), Adihup, Uran and Moi? Hans
Iwou (principal of the Primary School at Minyambou) claimed that Tinam and Adihup are
virtually the same, Moille and Uran (y.Iaran) are similar to each other, but clearly distinct
from Tinam, and Moi (also known as Mansim in Indonesian) is quite different. The latter
language variety, also called Moi Brai, was characterised as a mixture of Hatam and Biak,
spoken by a small group of people. Moi Brai turned out to be equivalent to Borai, apparently
a transcription of Brai with an epenthetic vowel. This language is still known by a few people
near the coast. It does seem to be related to Hatam, with some Biak-Numfor features as well.
See Reesink (forthcoming b). In Borai or Moi Brai one refers to the language by mor moi,
while mor pin is 'bahasa Nufor' = the 'Nufor language' and mor brer refers to 'Indonesian'.
In Hatam on the other hand, ni-hyet mor '3SG-voice mor' refers to 'Indonesian'. Apparently
the term mor, which meant 'language' to the Moi Brai, had the connotation 'foreign' to the
other Hatam groups, such as Miriei and Tinam.
The origin of the name Hatam is not clear. Pouwer (1 958:40) suggests that the word has a
Numfor origin: atam 'thatch of pandanus leaves'. Possibly it is an outsider's interpretation of
ni-hyet tinam '3SG-speech tinam' as a native speaker of Tinam would refer to hislher
language. Tinam is the major dialect, in which the New Testament has been published (by
Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia in 1 99 3). It is easily understood and spoken by speakers of the
other dialects. A systematic dialect study has not been done, but it seems that the major
difference between Miriei and Tinam is a regular correspondence between lsi and /hI, as in
M iriei sab and Hatam hab for 'bird', sum and hum 'fire', and so on. It is the Tinam dialect
that is the object of this study. I have no further information on variation between the other
Hatam dialects. Neighbouring language groups are Sougb and Meyah. The Sougb are called
Tuig in Hatam, and the Meyah are called Sreu.
Typologically, Sougb, Meyah and Hatam appear to be very similar to each other and to
other languages of the so-called West Papuan Phylum: SVO word order, verbal morphology
limited to subject prefixation, Noun-Adjective-Determiner in the NP, Genitive-Noun order in
possessive constructions, and the use of prepositions (see also Reesink 1 996). Lexically the
languages have very little in common, although a few items suggest a remote genetic
relationship between Hatam and the East-Bird's Head family, which comprises Sougb and
the closely related languages Meyah and Moskona. See Reesink ( 1 998).
All languages of the (eastern) Bird's Head have at least a few words of Austronesian
origin, presumably from Biak-Numfor, such as pas 'rice', sansun 'clothes' and wonggor
'crocodile' . Hatam has borrowed extensively. How old those loans are is hard to say at the
moment. Items such as pikor 'school', las 'day', pinak 'send' are probably quite recent, but
others, such as mai 'loincloth' (Numfor mar) and hup 'highlands' (Numfor sup) could be
quite old. See Reesink ( 1 99 8). An assessment of the relationship between Hatam and Biak­
Numfor would need more information on what seems to be the 'missing link ', the nearly
extinct language Borai.","[17, 18]"
"Possessive phrases are recursive, as in so many other languages, and the possessed item
does not need to be expressed when it is clear from the immediate context, as illustrated by

number of the subject. They contrast with inalienable nouns and adjectives in that third
person singular is not marked with ni- , but has zero affix.
Verbs allow a number of morphological processes, which will be presented after syntactic
features with respect to transitivity have been discussed. The basic difference between
transitive and intransitive verbs is that the former can have an object, but not necessarily
occur with one, whereas the latter do not allow an object.
3. 4. 1 Intransitive verbsIntransitive verbs, such as mai 'die', mmai 'be embarrassed', pa 'laugh', pim 'cry' cannot
have a direct object. To indicate the reason or cause for such a state of affairs, a
prepositional object is required, as for example tut in (3.6 1 a); (3.6 1 b) is ungrammatical.

"14In Griffith's dictionary nyen is glossed as 'repeatedly'. I have the impression it conveys something like
'without purpose', like nating in Tok Pisin: 01 i wokabaut nating 'they are just walking around'. It seems to
be present in hanyen 'anew' which co-occurs with bu 'again' in: noni kwei hanyen bu 'he come anew again'
'he came/comes/will come again'.
=4 Syntax
4.0 IntroductionHatam is a rather strict SVO language, with time adverbials normally preceding the
subject. A subject NP (where NP includes pronouns) is often not required, since the verbal
predicate is obligatorily marked for person/number of the subject. Oblique objects, such as
locative or directional adverbials, benefactive or purposive constituents, are expressed as
preposition phrases, following the direct object. However, in natural speech I have not found
instances of all the constituents within one clause. Thus, a general formula for the clause in
Hatam is:
± TimelModal ± S + Predicate ± 0 ± BEN ± LOCas in:
(4. 1 )Mmo

ni-de

"The verb ndo 'to show; point', which always marks the Recipient with bak or its weakened
form bi- in main clauses, allows relativisation on the Recipient with 'stranded' preposition, as
in example (4. 1 82), but the RC may also be formed without bak, as in (4. 1 8 3).

"This form is not a clear future tense marking, since many sentences referring to a future
event do not use it at all. Given its function in examples (3.76) and (3 .78), a gloss as
'posterior marking' seems to best capture its meaning.

3. 4. 7.3 NominalisationIt is possible that the posterior-marking mi- 1mV -I is etymologically related to the mi­
which appears on quite a number of lexical items, seemingly derived from verbs (or
adjectives). An elicited sentence such as (3.79) was indeed interpreted as containing
nominalised clauses, but this may be due to a misunderstanding. The real meaning may be
'post present moment of speech'.

"1Introduction1.1 BackgroundWhen the multidisciplinary program ISIR was conceived at the end of 1 992, the focus
was on the south-west of the Bird's Head peninsula of Irian Jaya. At the same time, we
realised that a detailed study of languages spoken in the eastern part of the Bird's Head was
necessary if we wanted to obtain a more complete picture of the so-called West-Papuan
phylum and other language groups in this area. One intriguing target was what was known as
a phylum-level isolate in the eastern part of the Bird's Head: Hatam.
Not much was known. We knew that missionaries of TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance
Mission) were working on a bible translation in that language, but no linguistic description
was available. The oldest information on the language was a (very) short article by Loukotka,
which contains a few words of the language. ' Cowan ( 1 953) does not contain any Hatam
material. He presents some data on what he calls Mansibaber, which can be identified as
Meyah or related Moskona, and Manikion (equated with Mantion), which can be identified
as Sougb.
In Voorhoeve (1 975) and Wurm and Hattori ( 1 98 1 ) Hatam and Borai are treated as
related languages, clearly separate from neighbouring language groups. In later publications,
Borai has disappeared and Hatam is listed as an isolate (Voorhoeve ( 1 987a, 1 987b), Silzer
and Heikkinen ( 1 99 1 )). In fact, Voorhoeve ( 1 9 8 7b:9 1 ) substitutes the name Tinam for
Hatam and Silzer and Heikkinen ( 1 9 9 1 : 50) include Borai together with a number of other
names as alternatives for Hatam.
Similarly, not much was known about Manikion or Mantion, Meyah or Moskona. As the
ISIR program started in 1 99 3 we learned that members of the Summer Institute of
Linguistics were active in Meyah (and Moskona), and that Manikion was in fact a derogatory
term for people who call themselves Sougb. In Sougb also, TEAM missionaries were
involved in bible translation, but no linguistic description was available.
Our plan, then, was to try to increase our knowledge of these languages, either through our
own fieldwork or through material from SIL linguists. The main question was: What kind of
language is Hatam? Related questions were: What is the status of Borai? Does it exist as a
separate language? Is it possible to get some more information on Sougb?
The answer to the first question is found in this monograph, with some preliminary
information on the related questions provided in this introduction (see § 1 .2).","[16, 17]"
"Texts1 33In order to make opaque syntactic structures more transparent I have indicated significant
pauses by a slash. This correlates for almost 1 00% with a rising intonation, signalling that
there is more to come. A falling contour on the final syllable indicates that a sentence has
come to its end. This is indicated with #. In the free translations I have tried to correlate
slashes with commas and # with full stops. Thus natural speech, which is hardly ever
delivered in the neat syntactic structures native speakers offer out of context, is maintained.
This allows the reader to understand apparent diversions from claims made in the grammar
regarding word order or presence/absence of certain morphological markers. At the same
time, at a number of places the recorded material is not clear enough to chose between
certain possible alternatives. This has been indicated in footnotes throughout the texts.
Indonesian loans, which occur sparingly in the four myths but are rather frequent in the text
about Kain Timur, are indicated in bold print.","[148, 149]"
