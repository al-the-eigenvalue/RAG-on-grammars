Several morphological strategies are available for forming emphatic negative utterances.
Note that all of these emphatic or intensifier forms also occur in affirmative clauses, but
in certain cases their function in negative clauses is distinct from their function in
affirmatives.
The most widely used negative emphasis marker or intensifier is the verbal
particle mún. This form follows Negative -nˆ¤h with verbs, adjectives, and adverbials. By
contrast, in affirmative clauses the variants muhún (which occurs in the Barreira dialect
region and is there formally distinguished from negative mún) and mún (Tat Deh dialect
area; both positive and negative) function as intensifiers with adjectives, but are not
grammatical with verbs (see §15.1.2). Use of this negative emphasis form yields such
adjectival and adverbial expressions as pay-nˆ¤h mún ‘not bad at all’ ~‘good, pretty’
(example 33),185 and verbal forms like hipãh-nˆ¤h mún (know-NEG INTS2) ‘(I) don’t know
at all’ and those in (34-35):
(33)yˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h=hinpay-nˆ¤h múnt ˆhbˆ¤/-ˆ¤hthat.ITG-NMZ=also bad-NEG INTS23sgwork-DECL‘That’s easy/nice work that he’s doing.’ (P.Sp.110)

Use of this form with adjectives appears to be somewhat idiomatic. The most striking case is naw-nˆ¤hmún (good-NEG-INTS2) ‘a lot, extremely numerous’.
185887Other emphatic forms that are productive with negative clauses (as well as with
affirmatives; see §15.1) include the Emphasis marker =pog, as in (36). The most
commonly used intensifier with affirmative clauses (-Vcáp) rarely occurs with negatives,
although this combination is possible, as illustrated by (37).","[902, 903, 904]"
"Formally, -nˆ¤h usually occurs as a verbal consonant-initial Boundary Suffix,875which receives primary (word-level) stress within the verb word; however, it can be
followed by some other Boundary Suffixes, in which context it is best considered an
Inner Suffix. The final [h] of -nˆh is usually clearly audible (especially when followed by
a vowel-initial Boundary Suffix), but is occasionally dropped in fast speech. Finally,
Negative -nˆ¤h is nearly identical to the Possessive marker nˆ‡h (see §5.2), but confusion
does not arise given their distinct tone values and their complementary distribution on
verbs and nouns, respectively. It is also homonymous with the verb root nˆ¤h- ‘be like’
(cf. §10.2.2.1), but because this verb—like all verb roots—is usually obligatorily
followed by a Boundary Suffix, the chance of confusion is again minimized.18316.1.1. Verbal negation in main clauses
In declarative clauses, negation with -nˆ¤h is a nearly symmetric strategy vis-à-vis the
positive clause: in most cases, the negative clause is structurally almost identical to its
positive counterpart, except that the negative marker usually takes the place of the
(otherwise obligatory) Boundary Suffix on the verb stem in the affirmative clause. While
not all Boundary Suffixes are incompatible with Negative -nˆh (in particular, the
Dependent marker -Vp and the Interrogative -V/ can follow -nˆh), the most common183Like any verb stem, nˆh- ‘be like’ can be followed by the Negative suffix:
tˆh bahad-nˆh-nˆ¤h
tˆ¤h=/íp=yˆ¤/
3sg=father=TEL 3sgappear-be.like-NEG‘He doesn’t look like his father.’ (EL)suffixes in affirmative main clauses—Dynamic -Vêy and Declarative -Vêh, among876others—are almost always replaced by -nˆh (cf. §16.1.5 below).
This near-symmetric pattern for declarative clauses is illustrated in examples (1ab), which come from a conversation; the negative utterance of the first speaker was
contradicted by the positive assertion of the second. Further examples of negative
assertions are given in (2-3).","[891, 892, 893]"

As the examples above show, negation with -nˆ¤h usually negates the entire verbal
predicate. In the case of compound verbs, however, negating the compound assertions of
the corresponding affirmative clause may require varying treatment of the compound
depending on the level of semantic integration of its combined stems.
In the case of less-integrated compounds (see §9.4.1)—in which verb stems are
strung together to encode a sequence or co-occurrence of relatively distinct events—the
Verbal Negator -nˆ¤h is usually understood to have scope over all preceding stems within
the verb word. Thus the most likely interpretation of a negative compound such as /ˆdwQd-ham-nˆ¤h (speak-eat-go-NEG) would be that none of these activities are taking place.
If one (or more) activity is occurring, the compound is broken up into two verbal880constructions, one negative and one affirmative, which function as two predicates (cf.
§9.2); for example, /ˆd-nˆ¤h (tˆh) wQd-hám-áy (speak-NEG [3sg] eat-go-DYNM) ‘(he’s)
going and eating (simultaneously) without speaking’, or /ˆd-wQd-nˆ¤h (tˆh) hám-áy
(speak-eat-NEG [3sg] go-DYNM) ‘(he’s) going along without eating or speaking’. This
co-presence of a negative and an affirmative verbal predicate—where the fully
affirmative counterpart would be expressed by a single verb compound—is common in
Hup (examples 14-16).","[896, 897]"

them.’ (P.Sp.)
One way of avoiding this scopal ambiguity involves setting the assertions apart from the
negative clause with the auxiliary verb ni- and the Simultaneous or ‘in spite of’
adverbializer -mˆ‡/:(21)cug’Q‡tcu/-yó/,hˆ‡/=tegcu/-yó/ní-mˆ‡/,bookgrab-SEQwrite=STICKgrab-SEQbe-UNDER‘Despite having grabbed books and pencils,

As discussed in §3.1.3 and §10.1, predicative adjectives in Hup are formally very similar
to verbs. Their behavior in negative contexts is consistent with this—they undergo
clausal negation in just the same way as do verb stems:
(22)pˆhˆ¤td´b-nˆ¤h=mQhbananamany-NEG=DIM‘(There are) not many bananas.’ (OS)
(23)g’ˆ-nˆ¤h=hç‚yúw-úh!hot-NEG=NONVISthat-DECL‘It’s not hot!’ (B.Cv)883Adjectives serving an adverbial function (see §10.2) usually appear within the
compound verb in negative contexts, as in (24-25a)—whereas they typically occur
outside the compound in affirmative clauses, as in (25b).

b)pˆ¤b tˆhtç/ç¤h-ç¤yfastrun-DYNM3sg‘He runs fast.’ (EL)
There are no inherently negative quantifiers in Hup; however, the clause-level
quantifier form pˆ¤d (‘all, each of’; see §6.5.2) can occur in negative clauses:
(26)/ˆ¤n=hintˆ¤h-a‡n “nQ¤n!” nç-nˆ¤hpˆ¤d1pl=also3sg-OBJDISTcomesay-NEG‘As for us, we never/ none of us told her “come!”’ (P.Sp.103)16.1.5. The interaction of verbal negation and other grammatical systems
It is cross-linguistically common for negation to interact with other grammatical systems
within a language, such as tense and aspect (cf. Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998, Miestamo
2003: 18). In Hup, whether a clause is marked as affirmative or negative may influence
the choices to be made in other grammatical systems.
Negative -nˆh can co-occur in the verb word with the majority of other
inflectional forms. In keeping with the Hup verbal template (cf. §8.3), Inner Suffixes884such as the Applicative and the Completive precede the Negative Boundary Suffix,
and peripheral forms pile up after it:(27)/ám-a‡n d’o/-/u‚h-nˆ¤h-áh

(28)/ãh bˆ/-hi-cˆ‚p-nˆ¤htQ¤1sgYETwork-FACT-COMPL-NEG‘I haven’t finished working yet.’ (EL)
In some cases involving aspect marking, two strategies of negation are available:
one symmetric (example 29a; compare 29b), the other asymmetric, with the aspect
marker occurring on the copula-like verb ni- ‘be’ (29c).","[898, 899, 900, 901]"

Negation in Hup’s sister language Nadëb has been described in some detail by
Weir (1984, 1994), who observes that Nadëb has a remarkably complex set of strategies
for negation, which reveal some typologically unusual features. For example, the only
negative constructions reported to have direct affirmative equivalents involve dependent
or embedded clauses and imperatives (Weir 1994: 291). Also, the negative marker used
in clausal negation has a nominal identity, which is typologically extremely rare—in fact,
Nadëb may represent the only example of such a strategy (cf. Miestamo 2003).
The strategies and morphemes found in Nadëb appear (at least superficially) to
have little in common with those in Hup. One possible cognate is the Nadëb post-verbal
particle manˆh, which bears some resemblance to the Hup Verbal Negative suffix -nˆh;
however, in Nadëb this negative particle is used exclusively in imperative clauses.",[917]
"87416. Negation
Negation in Hup is relatively complex. Three distinct strategies for expressing
negation are available, involving at least four different negative markers. These are all
forms of clausal or ‘standard’ negation, which produces the opposite truth value in the
clause (cf. J. Payne 1985, Miestamo 2003). The most common or basic form of negation
in Hup involves a negative suffix (-nˆ¤h) that is used exclusively with verbal predicates.
Another common strategy relies on a predicative particle (pãÙ), which is used as an
existential negator with noun phrases. Finally, the third negation strategy makes use of
an ‘identity negator’ particle (/a‡p) that can function both to contradict the entire clause
and to negate an individual constituent within the clause—often relating specifically to
the identity of a nominal entity. Because of this latter function of negating a constituent,
the particle /a‡p is not—unlike Hup’s other negative strategies—exclusively a clausal
negator.","[890, 891]"

pãÙmuhún-up, kçwNEG:EX INTS2-DEPpimentay’á/
crush(for those with) nothing at all, (I ordered them to bring) crushed pimenta.’
(LG-O.8)
The Existential negator pãÙ can co-occur with other negative particles. In example
(54), the speaker uses the negative particle nQ¤ (§16.1.7) to reinforce negative pãÙ when
relating what he has been told by Catholic missionaries. In (55), someone’s assertion pãÙ!
‘(there are) none!’ is contradicted by another speaker via the negative Identity particle/a‡p (see §16.3 below); note that the clause-level ‘contradictory’ nature of /a‡p is such that
this double negative results in a positive, as opposed to the use of reinforcing negative
particle nQ¤ in (54). Finally, although pãÙ cannot itself take the negative verbal suffix
-nˆ¤h, both existential and verbal negation occur together in the same sentence in example
(56); here the two negatives are conceptually completely independent of each other.","[909, 910]"

Content questions are typically answered with a standard declarative clause, or more
minimally, a single word that provides the particular information solicited. In the case of
yes-no questions, the typical response is the repetition of the verb phrase that appeared in
the interrogative (whether negative or affirmative), in declarative form. Subjects are
frequently dropped. Examples (156-60) illustrate question-answer dyads between two
speakers (A and B).

B)mQndítóg-a‡nBernadito daughter-OBJ‘To Bernadito’s daughter.’ (TD.Cv.105)
The affirmative particle h´‡/ ‘yes, all right’ is also common in response to polar
questions, and can be used either by itself or preceding an affirmative clause. For
example, the response in (161) comes from the story of the Tapir and the Turtle; the956Turtle has questioned the leaves of trees at the places where the Tapir had slept, and
they answer as follows:
(161) h´‡/, n’ít tˆh /çê‚h-çê‚h
yesthere 3sg sleep‘Yes, he slept there.’ (JA.73)
There is no general word for ‘no’ in Hup; however, the negative predicative
particle pãÙ (see §16.2) can be used in response to questions dealing with the presence or
existence of nominal entities:(162) A)hu‡p=d’´hpãÙhˆ¤d?","[970, 971, 972, 973]"

In the case of more tightly integrated compounds (in which the final stem carries
aspectual, modal, or other information; cf. §9.4.2), on the other hand, negating the
assertion of the corresponding affirmative clause frequently does not require splitting up
the compound, even though the negation may be more directly relevant to one component
stem than another. Thus in example (17), the negative of ‘sing loudly’ or ‘make noise
singing’ remains a verb compound, even though consultants judge it to be neutral as to
whether the singing itself continues or not. Similarly, the negation in (18-19) has scope881over the entire compound (‘order/tell to do Verb’), regardless of whether the activity
took place or not.184(17)yam-hç‚h-nˆ¤h=yˆ/níh!sing-make.noise-NEG=TEL be.IMP‘Don’t sing loudly!’ (EL)

As noted above, the Negative suffix -nˆ¤h typically has scope only over the verb
phrase in which it appears. However, when clause coordination involves a string of
sequential activities (marked with the Sequential suffix -yó/, which is itself incompatible
with -nˆ¤h; see §16.1.5 below), the interpretation of negative scope appears to be more
flexible. Example (20) comes from a speech delivered to the community, and lists a
series of activities that women are expected to do to carry out the planting of manioc;
only the last verb carries the negation, but the utterance was interpreted to mean that
women do none of these things (without some involvement on the part of their husbands).
However—especially with a definite subject such as yúp=/ãêy ‘that woman’—the
interpretation that all the activities were carried out except the last, explicitly negative
one is also possible.","[897, 898]"

speak-NEG-DEP‘There, neither speaking Tukano

The form nQ¤ is clearly a borrowing from Tukano, and is identified as such by
some Hup speakers themselves. In Tukano, a strong negative is likewise conveyed by
double negative marking in the clause, involving the negative particle neê and the verb
plus negative suffix (cf. Ramirez 1997: 154), and this property of double negation to
mark a strong negative is common to East Tukanoan languages generally. According to
Aikhenvald (2002: 134-5), a nearly identical emphatic double negation strategy—
involving the particle ne and the negated verb—also exists in Tariana, and can be
attributed to language contact between Tariana and East Tukanoan languages. The use of
the same negative strategy and form in Hup is clearly a result of its involvement in the
Vaupés linguistic area. However, the parallelism is not complete in Hup; nQ¤ cannot
stand alone in Hup to mean ‘no’, as it can in Tukano and Tariana (Aikhenvald 2002:
134).
The negative particle nQ¤ (and the Tukano and Tariana variants of this form)
bears a rather striking resemblance to the Portuguese negative nem, which typically
expresses a ‘neither/nor’ relationship, as can Hup nQ¤ . However, it is not clear whether889any actual historical link exists between these forms. Aikhenvald (2002: 135)
considers the resemblance “almost certainly coincidental”, noting that “a negative marker
with a dental nasal is attested in many languages of the area, of different genetic
affiliations”. Clarification of the origin of this particle awaits future research.","[904, 905, 906]"
"Margaritaas.for-INCH3pl-OBJsing-NEG3sg‘What about Margarita, didn’t she sing to them?’ (TD.Cv.103)877Imperative clauses, on the other hand, have an asymmetric negation strategy—
that is, the negative construction does not closely mirror its positive counterpart (compare
examples 16a and b; see §17.5 for discussion of imperatives). This is consistent with the
cross-linguistic tendency for imperative environments to often require special negative
constructions (cf. Kahrel 1996, Miestamo 2003: 20). In Hup negative imperatives, the
negated verb phrase acts structurally as an embedded adverbial clause (usually—though
not obligatorily—marked with the adverbializing =yˆ/ enclitic), while the main clause is
the imperative form of the verb ni- ‘be’:(6)a)tQ‚/nçhç-nˆ¤h=yˆ/níh!laugh-NEG=TELbe.IMP‘Don’t laugh!’ (B.Cv2)

-níníh:(8)kow’-níníh=h´ !
peel-NEG.IMP=TAG2‘Don’t peel (the fruit)!’ (B.Cv3.137)87816.1.2. Verbal negation in subordinate clauses
Relative clauses in Hup (see §18.2.3) undergo negation of the verb phrase just as main
clauses do. The Negative suffix takes the Dependent marker -Vp (example 9) and other
relative clause morphology (10).","[893, 894, 895]"
"16.2. Existential negative pãÙ
A second, distinct strategy of negation in Hup involves the negative particle pãÙ. This
strategy is used exclusively to express negation of a nominal entity, specifically relating
to the negation of its existence or presence (negative identity is handled by the particle/a‡p, see §16.3 below). The negative marker pãÙ stands on its own as a complete
predicate, ‘there does not exist’, and has scope over the noun phrase:(41)/ˆ¤n=dú=d’´hkot/ah=có/=yˆ/húppãÙ,1pl=ancestor=PLbefore=LOC=TELhumanNEG:EX‘In the time before our ancestors there were no people,

"(42)a)[tiyi‡/po‡g]pãÙmanbigNEG:EX‘There is no big man.’ (EL)890b)tiyi‡/ [pog]-nˆ¤h
manbig-NEG‘The man is not big.’
As a predicative particle, pãÙ frequently occurs by itself as a complete utterance (in
reference to an entity that is the topic of the discourse), meaning ‘(it’s) not here; (there) is
none’. It can likewise act as a negative interrogative predicate, as in pãÙ tˆ¤h? (NEG:EX
3sg) ‘is there none?’ or ‘is he/she/it not here?’. The affirmative parallel of pãÙ is the verb
ni- ‘be, exist’ (compare examples 43a-b), whose negated form ni-nˆ¤h (be-NEG) is
occasionally substituted for pãÙ, although this is not common (43c).","[906, 907]"

Finally, /a‡p shows the same flexibility as -nˆ¤h (example 20 above) in that a single/a‡p can negate an entire string of sequentially linked clauses:(73)nˆ‡/ãy=hiwˆ‡h=d’´h=yˆ/ nˆh-yó/,b’ç‡twˆd-yé,1sg.POSSFEM=relative=PL=TELroçaarrive-enterbe.like-SEQ‘I don’t do like my female kinsmen: return from the roça,

Hup has no general lexeme for ‘no’. A negative response or refusal typically requires
one of the strategies already discussed here, such as a verb phrase negated with -nˆh
(either echoed or summarized as nˆh-nˆ¤h [be.like-NEG] ‘not like that’), a noun phrase with
the existence negator pãÙ ‘none, not here’ (which, as discussed, can stand alone), or ageneric demonstrative or other noun with ‘identity’ negation (e.g. yˆ¤t /a‡p ‘not thus’),899depending on the type of negative required.
However, Hup does have several inherently negative lexical items and
expressions, in addition to the negative particles already discussed in this chapter. The
fixed negative phrase /ám ya/a‡pa/ is commonly used in response to questions to mean ‘I
don’t know’. Its etymology is obscure, but it appears to involve the second person
singular pronoun /ám, and possibly the form ya/a‡p ‘that’s all; that much’.
Inherently negative verbs in Hup include muy- ‘not get any, fail’, as in examples
(74-76). This verb can occur in compounds, and can itself take clausal negation (76). It
is almost certainly borrowed from Tukano, in which the near-identical form muiﬂ has
essentially the same meaning as its Hup counterpart (cf. Ramirez 1997b: 108).

Another verb that can be considered a lexical negative is yãhã/-, which usually
occurs in verb compounds to mean ‘stop doing Verb’:(77)yam-yãhã/-yˆ¤/!
sing-stop-TEL.IMP‘Stop singing!’ (EL)900Finally, the verbal Counterfactual marker -tQ‚/- can be considered inherently negative, as
discussed in §15.2 and in §16.1.7 above; it can even occur with the reinforcing negative
marker nQ¤, as in (79) (from a discussion of evil spirits).","[915, 916, 917]"

1pl-OBJ=also-DEPus, apparently…’ (i.e. there was a reason) (P.B.1)
The negative particle /a‡p is also used to negate non-predicative clausal
constituents. These include nominal arguments of the clause, both subjects (example 67)
and objects (example 68):(67)/ãêh=/íp /a‡p/a‡nkéy-éh1sg=father NEG:ID 1sg.OBJ see-DECL‘It wasn’t my father that saw me (but someone else).’ (EL)

The Identity Negator /a‡p can also be used to negate an adverbial expression, as in (69),
and can negate quantifiers such as nihu)ê/ ‘all’ (example 70) and b’ˆ¤yˆ/ ‘all, only’
(although, curiously, it is judged ungrammatical with the quantifier /ápyˆ/ ‘all’):

affirmative ones. This is illustrated by its occurrence with the Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h in
example (72), and with the Existential Negative pãÙ in (55) above.","[913, 914, 915]"

16.1.7. Reinforced negation with nQ¤
Hup uses an additional negative particle nQ¤ to mark a strongly negative clause. This
particle always occurs together with and reinforces some other negative marker; this is
usually the Verbal suffix -nˆ¤h, as in (38-39), but it may also be the Existential negative
particle pãÙ (see §16.2) or Counterfactual -tQ‚/- (see §15.2). Such reinforced negation is
fairly common—though far from ubiquitous—and is used by both older and younger
speakers.",[904]
"16.1. Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h
Hup prefers a morphological strategy for the negation of clauses. In most cases, this
involves a single negative marker -nˆ¤h (although in special cases two negative markers
can occur; see §16.1.7 below), which occurs as a suffix on the verb stem. Use of the
form -nˆh is limited exclusively to negation of the verb phrase predicate (which may
include predicate adjectives, but not predicate nominals).",[891]
"14.2.1. Counterfactual in conditional expressions
Counterfactual -tQ)/- typically occurs in the apodosis (‘then’ or consequent clause) of a
biclausal construction encoding an ‘if-then’ relationship. The protasis, marked with
Conditional -tQ‡n, usually precedes it, although this order is flexible (see §14.1). The
Counterfactual expresses the unrealized or unrealizable status of the condition, and is742preferred in explicitly hypothetical situations, where the condition cannot be met or is
not expected to be met within the relevant time frame:(12)/am=báb’ d´¤b-tQ‡n,
2sg=siblingd´¤bdˆ¤/=mQh/am d’o/-ye-tQ‚ê/-n’ˆ‡hmuch-COND much remain=DIM2sgtake-enter-CNTRFCT-NMZ‘If you had many siblings, you would bring in a lot (of fruit)!’ (C-Daba)

When the condition is recoverable from the discourse context, the Counterfactual-marked
clause may occur alone, without an associated Conditional clause (just as a Conditional
clause can itself appear alone):(14)yˆ¤nˆ¤ynˆ‡tQ‚êh bˆ/-tQ‚ê/-Q‚p,that.ITG.be.like.DYNM 1sg.POSS sonwork-CNTRFCT-DEPyãhã/-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤h…
stop-TEL-DECL‘Thus my son would have worked (had my wife been alive), but he stopped.’
(LG-O.12)
Counterfactual marking is typically absent where the condition is expected to be
or is regularly met (see §14.1 above), but it is required when the conditional situation is
obviously hypothetical. Thus (15), with an unmarked second clause, is inappropriate:(15)? hu‚tQ‚êh /ãh
bird1sgní-tQ‡n,/ãh way-d’ó/-óhbe-COND 1sgleave-take-DECL? ~‘If I were a bird, I’ll fly.’ (EL)
The Frustrative marker yQ‚êh (§14.4), which signals that an intended or anticipated
outcome is not realized, is extremely common (but not in general obligatory) in cooccurrence with the Counterfactual in conditional expressions:(16)hu‚tQ‚êh /ãh ní-tQ‡n,
bird1sg/ãh way-d’o/-tQ‚ê/-Q‚êybe-COND 1sg743yQ‚êhleave-take-CNTRFCT-DYNM FRUST‘If I were a bird, I would fly.’ (EL)
The Inferential Evidential forms =cud and -ni- (§14.9) also often co-occur (optionally)
with the Counterfactual, although less frequently than the Frustrative:(17)/ãh cˆh-nˆ¤h-tQ‡n,
1sgham-tQ‚ê/-Q‚êy=cudyQ)êhpáh/ãêh=ti/tired-NEG-COND go-CNTRFCT-DYNM=INFR FRUST PRX.CNTR 1sg=EMPH.TAG‘If I had not been tired, I would have gone.’ (EL)

impossible).’ (LG-O.10)
Counterfactual -tQ)/- never occurs in predicates marked with the Negative suffix
-nˆ¤h. Rather, the Counterfactual itself is to be interpreted as inherently negative or at
least neutral regarding negation (see §16.4 and below). Clauses expressing conditional,
hypothetical negative events (e.g. ‘she wouldn’t speak your language’) are phrased
exactly like those expressing positive events (e.g. ‘she would speak your language’), and
the negative/positive reading (i.e. whether or not the activity would be expected to take
place if the hypothetical condition were realized) must be taken from the context:(19)yˆkánnˆNˆ‡h/ˆ‡d/ˆd-tQ‚ê/-ay/u‚hníyover.there 2pl.POSS speech speak-CNTRFCT-INCH maybe‘Maybe she wouldn’t speak your language there (if you went there with her).’
(B-Cv.1-4)
Accordingly, while the best translation of (19) is negative, the appropriate positive
response would also use the Counterfactual: /ˆd-tQ‚ê/-Q‚êy! (speak-CNTRFCT-DYNM) ‘I
would speak (it)!’While Counterfactual -tQ)/- patterns like a typical Inner Suffix in combination744with verbal predicates, it can also occur with predicate nominals. In this environment,
the copula ni- is an option:(20)núp=/i‚hb’óy-op=/i‚hni-tQê‚/-Q‚êyyQ‚êhthis=MSC teach-DEP=MSC be-CNTRFCT-DYNM FRUST
‘This man would have been/ was almost a teacher.’ (EL)However, a verbal construction is not required for expressing counterfactuality; instead,
-tQ)/- (followed by Frustrative yQ)êh) may directly follow the noun, without a copula.
Furthermore, in this case -tQ)/ may appear without the Boundary Suffix that is obligatory
in its verbal realization (the Dynamic is ungrammatical):(21)núp=/i‚h b’óy-op=/i‚htQ‚ê/this=MSC teach-DEP=MSCCNTRFCT FRUST(-DECL) (*CNTRFCT-DYNM FRUST)yQ‚êh(-Q‚êh)(*tQ‚ê/-Q‚êyyQ‚êh)‘This man would have been/ was almost a teacher.’ (EL)
For predicate adjectives, either a copula construction with ni- or the nominalized
form (tˆh + adjective, resulting in a predicate nominal; see §6.6) is preferred, as in (22).
In this context, a verbal construction with the predicate adjective itself acting as a verb
root is judged only marginally possible.","[758, 759, 760, 761]"
"484Negation phenomena provide an illustration of this ungrammaticality of nonstem-related morphological material between component stems of a compound. Clausal
negation can take scope over the entire compound; as such, the negative suffix -nˆh is
compound-final, as in /´g-pQm-nˆ¤h (drink-sit-NEG) ‘not sitting drinking’, the negative
form of the compound /´g-pQ¤m-Q¤y (drink-sit-DYNM) ‘sitting and drinking’. When only
one verbal constituent of a compound is negated, however, this typically produces two
separate predicates. Thus ‘sitting and not drinking’ must be expressed via two
coordinated predicates: /´g-nˆ¤h pQ¤m-Q¤y (drink-NEG sit-DYNM). Each of these forms a
distinct phonological and grammatical word: they receive independent stress, and while
the subject (e.g. 3pl hˆ¤d) cannot be inserted between elements of the compound (*/´g
hˆd pQ¤m-Q¤y), it can come between the coordinated predicates in the negative
construction (/´g-nˆ¤h hˆd pQ¤m-Q¤y). Further examples are provided in (2-3).","[500, 501]"

Common emphatic forms involving negative pãÙ are given in examples (52-53).
Note that the variant of the emphasis marker in (53) (muhún; found in the Barriera dialect
area only) otherwise occurs only in affirmative clauses, whereas the Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h
is always followed by the variant mún (see §16.1.6).",[909]
"Tukano=PLNEG:EXDesano=PLNEG:EXno Tukanos, no Desanos…’ (LG.29)

together form the predicate, and the negative particle has scope only within the predicate,
as in (42b).",[906]

Hup has a rich repertoire of discourse-related formatives that serve the function of
marking affect, and indicate intensification, emphasis, focus, and other related features.
This chapter focuses on those markers that occur primarily on the level of the clause or
even of the entire sentence; many associate with predicates, and many are limited
exclusively to clause-final position. Formally, these markers are a heterogenous lot,
ranging from verbal Inner Suffixes to enclitics and particles; note that they are organized
here according to their semantics and function, not their form class. In addition to these
forms, Hup has other affect- and discourse-marking formatives that associate primarily
with nominal constituents of the clause; these are discussed in chapter 7.
The first section of this chapter deals with degree markers, which tend to associate
primarily with verbal and adjectival predicates. The following sections cover the group
of ‘promiscuous’ focus and emphasis markers that associate with predicates and other
clausal constituents alike, and the set of affect markers that occur more or less
exclusively in sentence-final position. The final sections of this chapter cover
interjections and ideophones.
The grammatical formatives associated with sentence-level affect marking are
summarized in Table 15.1:806Table 15.1. Sentence-level affect markers in Hup

Hup has a large and heterogeneous set of markers that act as intensifiers and function to
modify the degree of the assertion. Most associate with both verbal and adjectival
predicates, and several can also occur with nominal constituents. The intensifier particles
are functionally akin to many of the markers of focus and emphasis (see §15.2 and §15.3
below).","[820, 821, 822, 823, 824]"
"(29)a)ham-nˆ¤h bˆ¤g/ãêh-ãêh!go-NEG1sg-DECLHAB‘I never go.’ (D.int.112)

c)nç-nˆ¤h /ˆnni-bˆ¤-h´ !say-NEG 1plbe-HAB-TAG2‘(“Go to school!”) we never say.’ (P.Sp.)
On the other hand, certain tense, aspect, and mode specifications are not possible
within the negated verb word. Negative -nˆ¤h (itself having an ambiguous identity as
either Boundary or Inner Suffix, depending on what other formatives are present) cannot
co-occur with certain Boundary Suffixes. In particular, it is ungrammatical in
combination with Dynamic -Vêy and Declarative -Vêh (except in certain cases of clausecombining, see §18.1.2). It is likewise ungrammatical with Sequential -yó/ (a Boundary885Suffix), and an auxiliary construction with ni- ‘be’ is required in order to convey a
sequential negative event:
(30)wˆ/-nˆ¤hni-yó//ˆnb’ay-té-ay-áhhear-NEGbe-SEQ1plreturn-FUT-INCH-DECL‘Having understood nothing, we’d return.’ (B.Cv1.82)
Verbal negation is ungrammatical in the Apprehensive mood (see §14.6), and it also does
not co-occur with the Counterfactual marker -tQ‚/—presumably because the irrealis
nature of this morpheme gives it an inherently negative quality (see §14.2 and §16.4
below).
Finally, the Verbal Negative suffix -nˆ¤h is ungrammatical with the Future suffixes
-teg / -te- (although it can occur with -teg when this suffix acts as a purpose marker in a
dependent clause, as in example 13b above; see §13.1). This apparently idiosyncratic
aspect of Hup grammar probably has a historical explanation relating to the nominal
origin of these future suffixes, as discussed in the Historical Note in §13.1. In order to
express a negative future event, Hup relies on two alternative constructions. The most
common involves the Inchoative marker -ay, as in (31) (but note that this combination
can in some cases be used for a current, on-going event, so its future reading is implied
rather than entailed). The Future Contrast particle tán provides a second option for
expressing negative future, as in example (32).","[901, 902]"

The negative particle /a‡p has the function of contradicting an assertion or negating the
identity of a nominal entity (‘this is not an X’). It is not associated with any particular
word class, but may occur with nouns, verbal predicates, adjectives, or adverbials.
Formally, /a‡p is a free form, phonologically independent from the preceding
form(s). However, it can occur within the scope of an evidential enclitic (see example 65
below), which suggests that it can sometimes undergo a degree of morphsyntactic
integration with its clausal host. Negative /a‡p itself does not take any inflectional
markers. It appears to be homonymous with the ‘quantity’ marker /a‡p (see §6.5.3).
The most common use of /a‡p is as an identity negator with predicate nominals, as
in examples (57-60). The negative particle has scope over the entire noun phrase
predicate.","[910, 911]"
"NEG:ID PRX:CNTR that.ITG-DECL‘That’s not his thing to eat!’ (EL)When the negative particle /a‡p is postposed to a verbal predicate, it functions896to contradict an entire assertion, as in examples (63-65). This negation strategy carries
more contradictory force than the more common verbal negation strategy with the suffix
-nˆ¤h. With verbal predicates, /a‡p must follow the fully inflected verb (but is not
constrained by the type of inflection). The expression in (64) would be used with
children who are begging to eat someone else’s bananas, in order to impress upon them
that the rightful owner is a serious possessor and the coveted item is not up for grabs.","[912, 913]"
"15.1.2. Intensifiers mún / muhún
This intensifier, a particle, occurs with predicate adjectives, adverbials, and verbs,
although in the case of verbs it is restricted to negative constructions involving the Verbal
Negative suffix -nˆ¤h (see also §16.1.6). The form of this intensifier is also subject to
variation. Speakers in the Tat Deh dialect area pronounce it as mún in both positive
(adjectival) and negative (verbal and adjectival) expressions. In Barreira, however, a
formal distinction is maintained between the positive form, pronounced muhún, and the
verbal negative mún. It is more likely that muhún is the older form and that mún is a811reduced variant, particularly since such phonological reduction of forms is more
typical of the Tat Deh dialect.
Examples of muhún / mún (glossed INTS2) with adjectives are expressions like
náw muhún ‘really good’, tití/ muhún ‘really dirty’, and example (12). Note that muhún
/ mún can co-occur with Intensifier -(V)cáp to create an even stronger statement:(12)cãêpyi‡/-a‡n=b’ayother man-OBJ=AGAIN/am háy’-tQ‡n,

exist’ is an optional strategy for forming a negative, as in (13a). An alternative noncopula construction and corresponding affirmative form are given in (13b-c).","[895, 896]"
"A possible cognate with Hup pãÙ is found in Dâw. According to S. Martins901(1994: 163), verbal negation in Dâw involves the enclitic -E‚h, and nouns undergo
existential negation via a combination of this form with the nominal predicate marker ma,
resulting in the form mEh. This particle combines with nouns in much the same way as
does Hup pãÙ; for example, compare Dâw lay’ mEh (fishhook NEG) ‘there aren’t any
fishhooks’ with the same construction in Hup: hç‚pk´¤k pãÙ (fishhook NEG:EX). If future
work reveals that the Hup and Dâw forms are actually cognates, this will provide some
insight into the historical source of Hup pãÙ. Comparative work on the systems of
negation in these related languages awaits investigation.
As a final intriguing point, semantically parallel (though non-cognate) noncompositional negative lexical items meaning ‘I don’t know’ and ‘be absent/ inexistent’
(of which the latter is predicative) are found in both Tukano (uba and mãRi) and Tariana
(hãida and kuRipua) respectively, and this fact has led Aikhenvald (1999b: 404) to
suggest that this parallelism is an areal feature. That Hup also has analogous forms (/ám
ya/a‡pa/ and pãÙ) is likely yet another indication of its deep involvement in the Vaupés
linguistic area.","[917, 918]"
"17.1. Boundary Suffixes and clause type
Morphologically, Hup clauses in general are loosely defined by the Boundary
Suffixes, as discussed in §3.4.1.2. While a heterogeneous group, the Boundary Suffixes
(particularly the set of ‘simple’ suffixes) generally share the function of indicating a
clause’s type. Accordingly, they distinguish dependent or co-subordinate clauses of
various kinds (adverbial, relative, complement, sequential, conditional, etc.) and main
clauses having a particular illocutionary force (e.g. negative, interrogative, optative,
imperative, etc.).
Of the Boundary Suffixes, a subset of forms—which share a vowel-copying
profile (plus an unmarked ‘zero’ form)—can be defined functionally as maximally
‘basic’ in that they mark several of the most distinctive clause types and are otherwise
largely semantically neutral (Table 17.1; see also §3.4.1.2). Although these morphemes
are heterogeneous in their patterning inside the clause (and may in some cases co-occur
within the clause), when they occur on a clause-final verbal predicate they are mutually903exclusive186 and correspond consistently to clause type. These are by far the most
frequently occurring Boundary Suffixes in Hup, although they are often supplanted by
various other Boundary Suffixes (e.g. the Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h (§16.1), the forceful
Imperative -kQ‡m (§17.5.2), etc.). Where they relate to declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses, the functions and patterning of the various Boundary Suffixes
(including these maximally ‘basic’ forms) will be discussed in this chapter. The clausemarking functions of other Boundary Suffixes are treated in chapter 18 and other sections
of this grammar.

The relative order of subject and verb plays an important role in defining
declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses. In general, more than one ordering
option is available for a given clause type, but it is the interaction of syntax and clausefinal morphological marking that is crucial in distinguishing one from another.
The most basic morphosyntactic patterns that define the various types of main
clauses are listed below. Because the order of subject and object arguments in transitive

-Vêh; see §18.1.2 and below.

this schema. The patterns are indicated using the subset of Boundary Suffixes given in
Table 17.1 above, which are the most common markers of clause type, but it is important
to note that other Boundary Suffixes may appear in their place. For example, verb-final
declarative clauses may be marked with the Negative suffix -nˆh (or various other forms)
instead of the Declarative or Dynamic markers, and imperative clauses may take the
strong imperative suffix -kQ‡m instead of the -Ø form and high tone.

This section treats the declarative clause in Hup. Declarative clauses are defined both by
constituent order and morphological marking, and include both affirmative and negative
statements, as well as non-verbal clauses involving predicate nominals, adjectives, and
locatives.","[919, 920, 921]"
"(81)Copula ni-:
/ãêh=tQ‚êh
a)
1sg=offspring[tˆh=po‡g] ni-/e‡-h
3sg=bigbe-PERF-DECL‘My son used to be big.’934Verbal predicate ni-:
b)
[/ãêh=tQ‚êh
po‡g] ni-/e‡-h
1sg=offspring bigbe-PERF‘My big son used to exist/ be here’ (EL)
Some inflectional forms, such as Future -te-, can only appear on the copula (in contrast to
the Perfective, which can optionally be indicated directly on the predicate
nominal/adjective), as in (82). The fact that certain forms like the Future suffix can
attach directly to verbal predicates, but not to adjectival predicates, constitutes another
difference between members of the verb and adjective classes (and an exception to the
general rule that predicate adjectives pattern like verbs).
(82)Copula ni-:
/ãêh=tQ‚êh
a)tˆh=po‡g ni-té-h1sg=offspring 3sg=bigbe-FUT-DECL‘My son will be big.’
b)*/ãêh=tQ‚êhpog-té-h1sg=offspring big-FUT-DECL17.3.4. Copula clauses
As noted in the preceding sections, the verb ni- ‘be, exist’ can play the role of a copula in
predicate nominal clauses (including nominalized adjectives). This is not the only
manifestation of this verb’s special status in Hup grammar, as discussed in §8.4; it
appears in a wide range of unusual contexts and performs various functions that are in
general impossible for other verbs (e.g. noun incorporation, forming negative imperative
clauses, etc.).
The basic meaning of ni- is ‘be, exist’, and it occurs as a normal intransitive verb
in statements of location and existence. This use is extremely common, and is illustratedin (83-84). Its negative counterpart, the predicative particle pãÙ, typically replaces it in935expressions of negative existence, as discussed in §16.2.","[950, 951, 952]"
"15.3.4. Interactive Tag (-V)h´¤/
The Interactive Tag (-V)h´¤/ is used with statements to bid for attention and/or solicit a
response from listener. It may be related to the affirmative particle h´‡/ ‘yeah, OK’, used
for affirmative answers to questions or acquiescence to requests.
Interactive (-V)h´¤/ patterns in much the same way as do the other clause-final
discourse particles like Emphasis ya‡ and ti‡; it is an optional, stylistic device, its use is
subject to variation among individual speakers, and it is almost completely absent from
narrative—occurring only in quoted conversation or when a storyteller breaks out of the
narrative mode to make a meta-comment about the tale. Also like the other discourse
particles that are realized as ‘internally complex’ Boundary Suffixes (e.g. -(V)ti/ and
(-V)yá) in declarative clauses, it fills the required morphological slot (usually occupied by
Declarative -Vh) following clause-final declarative subjects, and requires an intervening
vowel-copy when attaching to verb stems.
Examples of the use of Interactive Tag (-V)h´¤/ are given in (133-36):847(133) tˆnˆ‡htˆ¤th´¤/, húp=d’´hb’ˆ¤yˆ/3sg.POSS string TAG2 Hup.person=PL onlynút ní-ih´¤/
here be-TAG2‘That was his line; just Hupd’´h will live here, you know?’178 (P-Sp.1)

other-daypˆ¤dg’ãê/-ãêyj’ámDIST be.suspended-DYNM DST.CNTRyˆ‚-n’ˆ‡hhçÙ‚p h´¤/that.ITG-NMZ fishTAG2‘The other day too some fish were in my net, you know.’ (B-Cv.3)
(135) tˆh
3sghã/-ta/-pˆ¤d-ˆh´¤/,nç¤h!stick.in.hand-meet-DIST-TAG2say‘He too put his hands into the hollow (to catch the fish as they emerged), you
know?’ (A-WT.3)
(136) /ˆnˆ‡hpãêt1pl.POSS haircó/-óy/ˆn hQy’-hu‚/-yˆ/-tég-h´¤/LOC-DYNM 1plcut-finish-TEL-FUT-TAG2‘(We’ll stick her hair onto our heads) after we’ve cut off our own hair, you
know?’ (B-Cv.1.2)
Like several other clause-final discourse markers, (-V)h´¤/ frequently appears together
with the Epistemic modality particle /u‚êh, as in (137); note that this example also
illustrates the use of (-V)h´¤/ with an interrogative clause.
(137) ham-pó-y/u‚êhgo-EMPH1-DYNM EPIST/ám h´¤/
2sgTAG2‘I guess you’re really going, huh?’ (EL)
Tag (-V)h´¤/ can also occur with the Focus marker -áh, which can result in a more
emphatic statement, as in (138) or the response in (139):
(138) wç‡h=d’´h
River.Indian=PLb’ˆ¤yˆ/-áh yúp
only-FOCd´¤b-´cápthat.ITG many-INTS1d’o/-g’ét-eh´¤/
take-stand-TAG2‘Only the Tukanos plant a lot, you know.’ (P-Sp.7)178This Hup idiom is much like that found in English, where ‘line’ (i.e. string) is used figuratively to mean
‘something that one habitually says’.","[863, 864]"

"Thelmathrow-send-go-TEL-FUT‘Thelma’s going to throw it out!’ (B.Cv.136)
The Future marker -teg / -te- is idiosyncrasic in that it is ungrammatical in
imperative and in negative clauses. Future tense can only be specified in the imperative
by means of the Future Contrast particle tán (see §13.4 below); a negative future
construction can also be with formed with tán, or expressed as Inchoative aspect (see715§12.3). The ungrammaticality of the Future suffix in negative clauses is an
irregularity that has no clear precedent elsewhere in Hup; by analogy with forms such as
Habitual bˆg / -bˆ-, one would expect the construction [Vstem-nˆh-teg] to be possible
(involving the Clausal negator -nˆh). In fact, small children do make exactly this
analogy, as illustrated by the following utterance by a three-year-old boy (example 12).
The unexpected ungrammaticality of this form probably has a historical explanation,
which is discussed below.","[731, 732]"
"12.11. ‘Ongoing event’ tQ¤
The ‘ongoing event’ marker tQ¤ indicates that the activity is still in progress. It normally
appears as a particle (but—unlike many peripheral forms—does not have an alternate
realization as an Inner Suffix). In affirmative clauses tQ¤ indicates ‘still doing Verb’:
(207) dó/=d’´h b’óy-óy
child=PLtQ¤study-DYNM YET‘The children are still studying/ at school.’ (OS)708(208) /ãh
1sgbˆ/-/e‡-ytQ¤work-PERF-DYNMYET‘I’m still working (and will be for a little while).’ (EL)
In negative clauses, it indicates ‘has not done Verb yet’ (i.e. ‘is still in a state of not doing
Verb’):(209)b’oy-nˆ¤htQ¤study-NEG YET‘(He’s) not studying yet’ ~ ‘hasn’t gone to school yet.’ (OS)
(210) hú/ biyiw /ãh j’id-nˆ¤h-ˆp
pium blood1sgtQ¤wash-NEG-DEP YET‘I haven’t yet washed off the pium (biting fly sp.) blood.’ (OS)
The form tQ¤ also occurs with predicate adjectives, as in naw-nˆ¤h tQ¤ ‘not well yet’ and
example (211):
(211) pˆ‡b
strongtQ¤,/ãêh-ãêhYET1sg-DECL‘I’m still strong.’ (T-PN.6)
In adverbial clauses, tQ¤ forms a unit directly with the verb stem, unless the Negative
suffix comes between them:
(212) tˆh
3sgbˆ/-tQ¤=yˆ/,teghçê‚=d’´hwˆdnQ¤n-Q¤hwork-YET=TELnon-Indian=PLarrive-DECL‘While he was working, non-Indian people arrived.’ (EL)

tremble-DYNM=REP‘When he hasn’t drunk yet, he trembles.’ (B-Conv.2.4)Finally, tQ¤ occurs with a few predicate nominals, particularly those ‘verby’709nouns that relate to periods of time (cf. §4.1.3), e.g. j’´¤b tQ¤ (night YET) ‘still night/dark’
(compare the adverbial expression j’´b-tQ¤-yˆ/ ‘dawn’), wág tQ¤ (day YET) ‘still
day/light’, and tˆh=pQcQ¤w=d’´h tQ¤ (3sg=adolescent.boy=PL YET) ‘still young (boys)’.
Consultants judged tQ¤ ungrammatical in combination with other nominals (e.g. *wQ‡d tQ¤
[intended meaning: ‘still have food’]), preferring the verbal form (N) ni-iy tQ ‘N still
exists, is here’. However, the following nominal use with ‘paper’ was considered
grammatical, in the context of a situation in which someone is going through a stack of
papers to find something at the bottom:
(214) cug’Q‡ttQ¤yúw-úhleaf/paper YET that.ITG-DECL‘It’s still paper.’ (EL)71013. Tense and related forms
While aspect indicates the internal temporal consistency of a given situation, tense
relates to the place of the event within the larger context of other events. That is, “tense
is grammaticalised expression of location in time” Comrie (1985: 9). In Hup, aspect
plays a much larger role than tense as a formal grammatical category; tense distinctions
are more often simply inferred from the aspectual distinctions and the context, rather than
being formally marked (see §12.2 and §17.3.2). This is not uncommon crosslinguistically; some languages, such as Burmese (Comrie 1985: 50), do not have a
grammaticalized system of tense at all.
The main tense distinction in Hup is non-future vs. future, which is most
commonly expressed via the variants -teg /-te- (note that -teg also encodes purpose),
discussed in §13.1. Hup also has two additional morphological strategies for indicating a
future event, although they are not restricted to this function (§13.2-3). In addition, the
language has a system of semi-grammaticalized, largely optional contrast particles that
encode distant past, temporal proximity to the speech event (usually recent past), and
future tense specifications; these are treated in §13.4.
The Hup tense-related morphemes and their slot classes are summarized in Table

the Future marker -teg and its phonologically reduced variant -te- are the only
grammatical forms that have a primary function of indicating the location of an event in
time. Thus the distinction between future and non-future is more salient in Hup than is
the distinction between past and non-past. This is not unusual cross-linguistically.
The forms -teg / -te- are in fact markers of relative future, in that they are used to
relate a given event to a reference point, regardless of whether that reference point is
concurrent with the speech act itself, or occurs at some other time. The suffix -teg has
the additional function of expressing purpose semantics, which intersects closely with its
function as an indicator of relative future. Comrie (1976: 2) notes that future is as much a
mode as a tense in many languages, and this purposive function of the Hup future tense
marker illustrates that this is indeed the case for Hup.","[724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"

That Negative -nˆ¤h has only local scope over the verb phrase to which it attaches is
illustrated by the fact that negation can occur independently in main and embedded
relative clauses, as illustrated by the elicited examples in (11-12).",[895]
"539Examples (131-32) show plural, human incorporated nouns that are unmarked for
case, with and without (case-marked) direct objects in the clause; example (133) shows
an incorporated form used as a nominalized, headless relative clause, in which the objectmarking occurs on the entire nominalized verb form but not on the incorporated noun.

from one case—that of do/-d’´h-ni- ‘have children, become a parent’—in which an
incorporated noun is obligatorily marked for plural. This plural-marking is frozen into
the compound construction and does not change with the pragmatics of the situation (i.e.
it appears regardless of whether the entities in question are actually single or multiple, as540in example (122) above and in (136). Note that the incorporated singular form has a
completely different meaning, do/-ni- ‘be a child’ (example 137).

child-be-DYNM‘I am a child.’ (EL)In addition, incorporating ni- constructions act as units in derivation and other
verb-related processes. They appear in the middle of longer verb compounds, such as
b’oy-cum-ni- (study-beginning-be-) ‘begin to study’ in example (120) above, and can
take verbal valency-adjusting prefixes like any other verb:
(138) hi-bab’-ni
FACT-sibling-be‘four’ (lit. ‘caused to have a sibling/companion’)
(139) /u‚h-bab’-ni-d’o/-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y
RECP-sibling-be-take-TEL-DYNM‘Come to live with relatives (after having lived away)’ (EL)Finally, still more evidence that the [noun + ni-] forms involve incorporation
comes from negation strategies, which are different for predicate nominals and for verbal
predicates (see chapter 16). Nominals may be negated with the ‘negative existence’
particle pãÙ (‘is not present, does not exist’; example 140a), while verbal negation
requires the suffix -nˆ¤h on the verb (140b). Incorporating forms typically take verbal
negation (example 141).","[555, 556, 557]"
"173As discussed in §8.3, verbs (in most moods) minimally require one, and only
one, Boundary Suffix (arguably including certain -Ø marked forms) when acting as
predicates, but may have anywhere from zero to multiple Inner Suffixes (preceding the
Boundary Suffix) and peripheral formatives (following the Boundary Suffix). As a class
of verbal formative, the Boundary Suffixes do in general have a functional common
denominator: one appears on every verbal predicate to mark the clause type, in some
cases almost like a marker of punctuation. Thus a subset of Boundary Suffixes indicates
various types of main clause (declarative, interrogative, negative, etc.), as well as
indicating finer distinctions such as strong vs. neutral imperative, optative, and
apprehensive (all of which could be considered sub-types of imperative), etc. Another set
of Boundary Suffixes indicates the various types of dependent or subordinate clause,
including complements, relative clauses, and various adverbial clauses. While grouped
accordingly in the discussion below, these suffixes are treated elsewhere in the grammar
alongside other formatives to which they relate functionally and semantically, rather than
formally (as noted above). A few forms can appear as either Boundary or Inner Suffixes
(see B below); these are Future/Purpose -tég, Inchoative -ay, and Negative -nˆ¤h.
As noted in §3.4.1 above, the label ‘suffix’ applied to these formatives is to some
degree a language-specific convenience, which expresses their relative integration with
the root vis-à-vis the more peripheral forms (‘clitics’ and ‘particles’). In fact, many of
the Boundary Suffixes have certain clitic-like attributes: they can attach to different parts
of speech, and often are attached at the phrasal or clausal level (i.e. with scope over a
larger unit than their phonological host).","[189, 190]"

In a much less frequent use, the form kQ‡m appears without any preceding verb
stem, and behaves like a discourse particle or interjection (example 192). Consultants
say that this use is related to key-kQ‡m ‘look, pay attention!’; it may be an abbreviated
form of this common attention-getting expression that has developed a secondary use as a
discourse marker.

(T-PN.3)17.5.3. Responses to imperatives
Responses to commands are much like the responses to questions, discussed above in
§17.4.5. An acquiescent response is usually a simple h´‡/ ‘yes, all right’, as illustrated in
the text example in (193), and may also involve the repetition of the predicate (often in
future form). A negative response may likewise involve the repetition of the predicate, in
negated form.

(P.BWB.87)96618. Clause combining
Hup has a rich repertoire of strategies for combining clauses. Mechanisms
involve coordination, subordination, and cosubordination, including what may be best
characterized as clause-chaining. This chapter begins with a discussion of coordination
in Hup, then moves on to subordination and cosubordination, where at least one clause is
dependent on another. Hup has an especially wide selection of (co)subordination
strategies for indicating temporal overlap or succession of events.
As is consistent with Hup morphological patterns generally, most of the
morphological forms used to signal clause linkage are verbal suffixes or enclitics, and
these usually follow the second (or final) clause, occurring at the end of the sentence.
Only two are particles that come between the linked clauses, and both of these are
probably borrowings from Portuguese (likely via Tukano).
Many of the markers discussed in this section have already been encountered in
previous sections of this grammar. These have other uses that are distinct or only
marginally related to their clause-linking functions, and as such they may also occur on
independent clauses and even on clausal constituents. While doubt can rarely be
completely eliminated as to whether they are polysemous (either synchronically or
diachronically) or homonymous, polysemy often appears to be motivated semantically,
and is certainly in keeping with the high level of polysemy found among forms in Hup
generally. Where these forms are addressed in this chapter, their other uses are
mentioned, and cross-references are made to the appropriate sections in other chapters.","[981, 982, 983]"
"Q-NMZ2sgmake-FUT‘What are you going to make?’(OS/EL)
In the purpose question in (22b), the mere presence of stress on -teg is arguably enough
to give it a verbal identity; in addition, the semantics of purpose correspond to the
semantics of future.
Moreover, the two very similar questions in (22) could have equally similar
responses, since subjects are typically dropped in Hup when responding to questions.
Like the corresponding questions, responses like those in (25) are likely to be
pragmatically equivalent, and are formally differentiated only by stress.
(25)(a)hˆ‡/=teg
write=thing/shaft‘(It’s) a pencil.’
(b)hˆ/-tég
write-FUT‘(I’m) going to write.’
The semi-nominal identity of Future -teg / -te- in Hup may also explain its
ungrammaticality in negative clauses. Since Hup uses a different strategy for negating
nominal entities than for negating verbal clauses (see chapter 16), it is in fact predictable722that an intermediate form like teg would pattern irregularly in negated contexts. This
is supported by the fact that it is not only the verbal form of teg that is irregular when
negated, but the nominal form as well. On the one hand, a possessed nominalization with
=teg undergoes normal existential negation just like any other noun:(26)[[nˆ‡pQ‡m=teg]pãÙ]1sg.POSSsit=thingNEG:EX‘My seat (log for sitting) is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)
(27)[[nˆ‡hç‚Ùp]pãÙ]1sg.POSSfishNEG:EX‘My fish is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)
However, while most nouns can also appear with existential negation in predicate
nominal clauses with no overt copula, as in (28), nominal constructions with =teg are
ungrammatical when they appear with a nominative pronoun in the same type of
construction, as illustrated in (29); compare (29) to (26) above, where the only surface
difference is the form of the pronoun.","[738, 739]"

In (7), the Conditional occurs in a negative predicate, where it follows the Negative suffix
-nˆ¤h:
(7)nˆ-nˆ¤h¤ -ipbˆ¤gyQ‚êhj’ãêh/ãêh-ãêh, /ãh pe/-ni-nˆ¤h-tQ‡n-Q)êh!this-be.like-DEP HAB FRUST DST.CNTR 1sg-DECL 1sgbe.sick-be-NEG-COND-DECL‘I’d always do like that too, if I weren’t sick!’ (TD.Cv)
The Conditional also occurs with predicate adjectives (including those used in
adverbial phrases), as is consistent with their verbal identity (see §10.1):(8)g’ˆ¤-tQ‡n=yˆ/tˆh náw-áhhot-COND=TEL 3sg good-DECL‘When it’s hot, it’s nice.’ (EL)
Conditional -tQ‡n is itself ungrammatical in imperative and interrogative clauses,
or in combination with future tense morphemes (-teg / -te-, tán); however, it can appear
in a protasis while imperative, interrogative, or future tense is expressed in the
accompanying apodosis:(9)t´w-tég/ám, tˆh bˆ/-nˆ¤h-tQ‡n?scold-FUT 2sg3sgwork-NEG-COND‘Will you scold, if he doesn’t work?’ (EL)
In addition to its use as a conditional marker, the form tQn appears elsewhere in
Hup and performs a distinct function: it marks an equative comparative construction,
where it indicates ‘same amount as, same way as’ (see §10.2.2.1).160 The functionalWhether these two uses represent homonymy or polysemy of -tQn is unclear; see discussion in
§10.2.2.1.",[757]
"1035While this would seem to be an argument against normal clause-chaining, this
reversal of clause order involving the Sequential is quite rare in Hup, and it is possible
that the very few examples like (169) could be explained as an afterthought on the part of
the speaker.
(169) tˆh pé/-éy,húptok/´g-yó/3sg sick-DYNM person.belly drink-SEQ‘He’s sick, after drinking caxiri.’ (OS)
As noted above, use of the Sequential also usually requires the same subject for
both clauses. However, there seem to be a few exceptions to this rule as well:
(170) na/-hipãh-nˆ¤h
die-know-NEGg’ã/-hi-ham-yó/,
be.suspended-FACT-go-SEQ‘(The old man) having lain for a long time in his hammock without knowing how

The Sequential can occur in Interrogatives, although examples of this usage are
limited. For example, the Sequential form ‘having wanted what’ is used to mean ‘for
what reason?’ in (171) (also see the use of causal keyó/ (key-yó/ [see-SEQ]) in
interrogatives; §18.2.6.6 below).
(171) /eckóda ham-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤ypah-áphãêy-ãêh,hocinéa-áh,school(PT) go-TEL-DYNM PRX.CNTR-DEP um-DECL Rosinea-DECL‘That what’s-her-name, Rosinea, went to school;
hˆ)-n’ˆ‡h tuk-yó/ ? nç-kQ‡m
Q-NMZwant-SEQsay-IMP2For what reason, say?’ (P.Sp.107)1036Example (172) illustrates the incompatibility of the dependent Sequential
clause with verbal negation; negative predicates require copular ni- ‘be’, as a coordinated
predicate, to host the Sequential.
(172) wˆ/-nˆ¤hni-yó//ˆnb’ay-té-ay-áhhear-NEGbe-SEQ1plreturn-FUT-INCH-DECL‘Having understood nothing, we’d return.’ (B.Cv1.82)
Like negative clauses, predicate nominal clauses also require copular ni- to host
the Sequential, which cannot attach directly to the predicate nominal itself (cf. §17.3.3.1;
compare the negative clauses above). However, there is at least one exception to the
primarily verbal identity of Sequential -yó/ : it can follow nominal forms that take the
Oblique case (as a locative), to mean ‘having gone to/ been at X’:(173) tátdeh-ét-yó/,cãw yucá-an tˆh ham-té-htaracua.ant water-OBL-SEQ SãoJosé-DIR3sg go-FUT-DECL‘Having been at Tat Deh, he’ll go to São José.’ (EL)18.2.6.4. Simultaneity and concession with -mˆ‡/
The Boundary Suffix -mˆ‡/, like Sequential -yó/ and other forms discussed in this chapter,
attaches to verb stems to form dependent clauses, and may be better considered to
involve clause-chaining rather than subordination. Where Sequential -yó/ favors the
same subject in the linked clauses, use of Simultaneous -mˆ‡/ reveals a strong preference
for different subjects; this appears semantically natural, since two simultaneous actions
are normally more likely to be performed by two different people than by the same
person.","[1051, 1052, 1053]"
"(10)toho náw hˆdnˆ‡h
white goodhoho‡d-óh3sg.POSS clearing-DECL‘It’s beautiful and white, their clearing.’ (because it is sand) (B.Cv2.131)547A final property of adjectives that distinguishes them from both nouns and
verbs is their association with the Intensifier morpheme muhún / mún (dialectal variants;
§15.1.2). This intensifier virtually never associates with nouns, and occurs with verbs
only when these are negated by the clausal negator -nˆ¤h; however, it is very common with
adjectives in affirmative (as well as negative) utterances:(11)tití/ muhún yúw-úh !
dirtyINTS2that.ITG-DECL‘It’s really dirty!’ (OS)
(12)cãpêyi‡/-a‡n=b’ay/am háy’-tQ‡n,other man-OBJ=AGAIN 2sgyúptˆh=páy muhún cáp-áh!mess.around-COND that.ITG 3sg=badINTS2INTS1-DECL‘If you mess around with another man, that’s really really bad!’ (H.txt.60)
The Elative morpheme -k´d also occurs with verbs and adjectives, but in the latter case,
[adjective + Elative k´d] form a compound adjectival unit, lacking a Boundary Suffix
(see §10.2.2.2.A below). Elative -k´d is always followed by a Boundary Suffix when it
associates with verbs (i.e. it appears as part of the verbal compound).
While adjectives in Hup are best understood as comprising a closed class, there
are a few cases in which uninflected verb stems follow nouns as modifiers. Although this
is in general a diagnostic of adjectives as opposed to verbs or nouns, these uninflected
verbal variants are not productive, but are frozen into specific lexicalized forms such as
kQn pú ‘shibé’ (a drink of farinha and water). They are therefore not considered to be
part of the adjective class. Another unusual case is dç/key ‘correct’, a lexicalized
adjectival form derived from the verb compound dç/-key- (‘count-see’); this form is a
derived adjective, but its etymological components are clearly members of the verb class.","[563, 564]"
"651Presumably, the idea of entering into or initiating a negative state is semantically akin
to the expectation that the negative state will exist at some time in the future. However,
use of -ay in a negative construction is not restricted to future reference, and may also be
used to describe a current transition into such a state, as in (35).
(34)/ãh ham-nˆ¤h-ay
1sggo-NEG-INCH‘I’m not going to go.’ (OS)
(35)pe/-nˆ¤h-ay
sick-NEG-INCH‘(I’m) not sick anymore.’ (OS)
The Inchoative marker co-occurs with (and typically follows) many other aspect
markers. It is particularly common following the Telic marker (an Inner Suffix that
indicates complete involvement of the participants, see §12.6). In (36), the same
utterance with Dynamic -Vêy in place of the Inchoative would be translated as ‘are you
(fully) used to’, whereas the Inchoative lends the sense of a transition; similarly, the
Inchoative in example (37) indicates the transition to a state of being cool (whereas the
Dynamic would mean that it was completely cool and may have been so for some time).","[667, 668]"
"‘Give me a buriti palm fruit, please!’ (OS)
There are certain restrictions on the use of the Perfective aspect marker in Hup: it
cannot occur in negative clauses, and does not combine with the Habitual bˆg / -bˆ(which is by definition not temporally bounded, see §12.8), or with the Completive aspect
marker -cˆ‚w- / -cˆ‚p- (presumably because this marker already encodes perfectivity, see
§12.5). In combination with certain verbs and adjectives, the Perfective may be
ungrammatical or restricted to a very specific interpretation. For example, it is not
acceptable with the verb na/- ‘die, lose consciousness’ when this refers to actual death
(presumably because death as a transition is inherently perfective, and the resulting state
by definition lacks an endpoint); the Perfective is only grammatical with this verb when it
has the sense ‘lose consciousness’:(84)666t ˆhna/-yˆ/-/e‡-y3sglose.consciousness-TEL-PERF-DYNM‘He lost consciousness (but has woken up again).’ (RU)
In addition to its use as an Inner Suffix with verbs, the Perfective marker can also
occur with predicate nominals (always in its unreduced form -/e/, and with the formal
qualities of an enclitic, specifically lack of stress).146 The occurrence of Perfective -/e/
with predicate nominals is fully productive, and involves both prototypical nouns (as in
examples 85-86) and nominalizations (example 87). In most cases, the perfective
meaning has to do with a previous identity of the referent, which no longer holds true.
Note that an alternative way to express the same information involves a copula with a
Perfective (verbal) Inner Suffix and following Boundary Suffix (86b) (see §17.3.4).","[682, 683]"
"The use of the clause-final Interactive tag -(V)h´/ (which itself occurs as a Boundary Suffix on the
verb) with affirmative-type clauses is probably related to this interrogative strategy (see §15.3.4).",[967]
"12.8. Habitual bˆ¤g / -bˆThe form bˆ¤g and its phonologically reduced variant -bˆ- indicate habitual aspect. They
refer specifically to habitual or customary events that hold true within the time frame of
the utterance; in this, they differ from many of the aspectual markers discussed in this
chapter, which are flexible with regard to reference point.
The unreduced Habitual marker bˆ¤g is identified as a particle, since it follows the
verbal core when Dynamic -Vêy is present (as well as a few other forms, such as theNegative suffix -nˆh), and takes independent stress (high/falling tone). It occurs in683indicative, negative, and interrogative clauses alike to express a habitual activity:
(133) /icabél/´g-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤yIsabelbˆ¤gdrink-TEL-DYNM HAB‘Isabel always drinks (hot things) right up.’ (OS)
(134) pQ‡j
umari.fruitwQ¤d-Q¤ybˆ¤g/ám?eat-DYNMHAB2sg‘Do you eat umari?’ (i.e. do you like it/ are you in the habit of eating it?) (OS)
(135) /ám-a‡nm’Q-nˆ¤h bˆ¤gtˆ¤h?2sg-OBJcool-NEG HAB3sg‘Doesn’t it (hammock) always make you cold?’ (OS)
Like most particles in Hup, bˆ¤g appears as an Inner Suffix—drawn into the verb core—
when the verb is marked by vowel-initial Boundary Suffixes other than the Dynamic
(most commonly Declarative -Vêh), as in the following examples.150 Note also that
Habitual bˆg can follow the interrogative pronominal form ‘what’ (example 138)—as can
other verbal formatives such as the Frustrative—although it is otherwise limited primarily
to verbs.(136) tedé/ódahˆdwˆd-hí-bˆ¤g-mah-áhthreehour3plarrive-descend-HAB-REP-DECL‘They always arrive by 3:00, they say.’ (OS)

The fact that particles like bˆg (themselves morphosyntactically bound formatives) are so frequently
phonologically bound to the verb calls into question the characterization of Hup given in Payne (1990: 220)
(based on work by Moore and Franklin 1980). Payne presents Hup as an isolating language that expresses
aspect, mood, etc. by means of independent words, and she illustrates this claim with examples of the
Habitual marker bˆg as an independent form. Note, however, that its true use as an independent lexeme is
functionally and semantically distinct from its use as a Habitual marker (see below).

The Habitual marker’s phonologically reduced variant -bˆ- occurs exclusively as
an Inner Suffix followed by a vowel-initial Boundary Suffix, as is the case for all such
reduced (CV) formative variants (but note that the unreduced variant can occur optionally
in this environment as well, as in (137) above) (see §3.6). Semantically, the two variants
are essentially interchangeable (compare example 143), although bˆ¤g is sometimes
preferred in more forceful, emphatic utterances.

(Int.txt.114)
In keeping with its restriction to a time frame concurrent with the speech moment,
the distribution of Habitual bˆg / -bˆ- is limited. In particular, it is generally not found
with past tense statements that have a defined endpoint, and is therefore ungrammatical in
combination with the Perfective aspect marker -/e/ / -/e-. To express a habitual event
that once held true but no longer does, the Perfective alone may be used:
(144) nç-/e‡-h
say-PERF-DECL‘(I) used to say (it, in my childhood).’ (Int.txt)
The Distributive marker pˆ¤d may also express habitual aspect in combination with the
Perfective (see §12.9.1 below).
Habitual bˆ¤g / -bˆ- is likewise ungrammatical in future-tense expressions, in which
habitual meaning may be conveyed through use of the future/contrast marker tán
(§13.4.3), or via lexical strategies such as k´k´y-nˆ¤h (interrupt-NEG) ‘without fail’ and
wág k´d-nˆ¤h (day pass-NEG) ‘every day’. Lexical means are also the only available
strategy for expressing habitual aspect in imperative clauses:
(145) k´k´y-nˆ¤h,
interrupt-NEGyç‚Ùh/´¤g!medicinedrink.IMP‘Without fail, take your medicine.’ (EL)(146) wág k´d-nˆ¤h,
daypass-NEG686yç‚Ùh/´¤g!medicinedrink.IMP‘Take your medicine every day!’ (EL)
In addition to its use as a Habitual marker, the form bˆg also occurs as a free
lexeme in Hup. Used as an adjective, bˆ‡g means ‘old’ (i.e. ‘existing for a long time’), and
is used in reference to inanimate entities and most animals (although not humans):
(147) ti‡wbˆ‡gyúw-úh!patholdthat-DECL‘That’s an old path!’ (OS)
The free lexeme bˆ‡g (and its inchoative variant bˆ‡g-ay) is also used as an adverbial to
express durativity, ‘for a long time’:
(148) yˆkan
over.therebˆ‡g/ãh ní-an-aylong.time1sgbe-DIR-INCH‘During the long time I stayed there…’ (T-PC.1)

long.time-NEG=TELb’uy-d’´h-yˆ¤/
throw-send.away-TEL.IMP‘Throw it out right away (lit. ‘in a not-long time’.’ (EL)Historical Note
Despite the differences between the various realizations of the form bˆg, we can
with high probability posit a historical relationship between them. Just as the Inner
Suffix -bˆ- is a grammaticalized form of bˆ¤g (which acts as both a particle and Inner
Suffix), the Habitual marker in turn probably derives from the free lexeme bˆ‡g. As an
independent word, bˆ‡g must have developed two related meanings and functions: the687adjective ‘old’ (i.e. ‘existing for a long time) and the adverbial ‘for a long time’
(although it is not clear which one of these was prior). Semantically, the sense of doing
something or existing over a long period of time is not far removed from the idea of
doing that thing over and over during an unbounded period of time—i.e. habitually (cf.
§3.7).
Additional evidence for the polysemy of the Habitual marker and the free lexeme
‘old; for a long time’ comes from semi-ambiguous contexts of use. For example, (151) is
from the story of how the Pleiades constellation came to be: a group of brothers were
seduced and tricked one by one by the Rattlesnake’s daughter into being bitten by her
father, and were later sent up to the sky. The free form bˆ‡g is used here to indicate that
‘(the snake bit all the men) over the course of a long time’; but if it were cliticized to the
preceding verb word (g’´ç-hu‚/-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y bˆ¤g [=mah]) it would mean ‘(the snake) habitually
bit them’. The semantic difference is not very great.

Hup has several morphological means of indicating iterativity, which correspond to
different strategies for conceptualizing the repetition of events. The Distributive formpˆ¤d (with free and bound variants) indicates one to multiple repetitions of an event,688and can also signal the durativity or continuity of a given event or state over time. Root
reduplication marks events that are conceived as intrinsically characterized by multiple
repetitions or realizations of a semantically salient feature, and the enclitic =b’ay
indicates a single repetition of an event, of some aspect of that event, or of its resulting
state.","[699, 700, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705]"

(48)bab’=ãêypãÙ,c´t=/ãêypãÙni-yó/sibling=FEMNEG:EXolder.sibling=FEMNEG:EXbe-SEQ‘Having been without a younger sister, without an older sister.’ (Dab.78)
Also unlike normal verbs, the predicative particle pãÙ cannot directly take the
Future suffixes -teg / -te-, which are similarly ungrammatical with Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h(see §16.1.5 above). As in the case of verbs taking the -nˆ¤h negative suffix,892predicative pãÙ takes the Future Contrast particle tán instead, as in example (49).","[908, 909]"
"12.3. Inchoative -ay
The suffix -ay combines with predicates to mark inchoative aspect, and indicates a
transition into a state or the initiation of an event. Inchoative -ay is independent of tense;
when occurring alone with no other aspect or tense markers markers, its interpretations
can vary as to whether an event or a transition into a state has just begun, is currently
beginning, or is about to begin, vis-à-vis a given temporal reference point.
Formally, Inchoative -ay is unusual in that it can act either as a Boundary Suffix
or as an Inner Suffix, followed by another Boundary Suffix. Like several other vowelinitial Boundary Suffixes, -ay is unstressed, while the stem it follows receives stress.
Also—like all other vowel-initial suffixes in Hup—Inchoative -ay conditions consonantgemination on stems, as discussed in §2.1.2.1. Because it is consistently oral, this results
in a homorganic nasal-oral consonant cluster when the stem is nasal, such that the surface
realization of a form like hám-ay (go-INCH) is [hám-bay] (compare hám-áy (go-DYNM)
[hám-máy]).
In direct combination with verb roots, -ay typically indicates that an event is about
to take place:(26)b’e‡h-ay
cross.stream-INCH‘(I’m) going across the stream.’ (i.e. home to the other end of the village) (OS)650(27)hám-ay
go-INCH‘(We’re) going.’ (said on the point of leaving; equivalent to ‘goodbye’) (OS)
It can also indicate that the event has just begun to take place:(28)de‡hd’o‡j-aywaterrain-INCH‘It’s beginning to rain.’ (OR: ‘It is about to rain.’) (OS)
(29)n’i-có/tˆhthere-LOC 3sgní-ay
be-INCH‘He’s living there now.’ (recently left previous home) (OS)
(30)yú-ay=mah,tˆ¤h-ˆw-ˆ¤hwait-INCH=REP 3sg-FLR-DECL‘She’s waiting, she says.’ (she has just started) (B-Cv.1.5)

screaming (to attract them).’ (C.1)
The Inchoative is common in imperative mood (see §17.4), especially for slightly
impatient imperatives. In these constructions, both -ay and the preceding stem (or Inner
Suffix) take the stress and high tone of the imperative mood:(32)húptok g’ç¤p-áy!
caxiriserve-INCH.IMP‘Start serving caxiri!’ (i.e. it’s ready, go ahead)
(33)/ç‚h-yˆ¤/-áy!
sleep-TEL-INCH.IMP‘Go to sleep!’
In negative clauses, Inchoative -ay is typically used to indicate a negative future
event (as in example 34), and is among the only grammatical means for doing so, since
the Future suffix -teg / -te- is ungrammatical in negative clauses (see §13.1).","[666, 667]"
"946Examples of predicate-focused polar questions are given in (123) (posed on the
morning after a drinking party), and (124), which was uttered by a grandmother,
exasperated by the younger men’s liquor-drinking.
(123) /´g-na/-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤ynˆ¤N?drink-lose.consciousness-TEL-DYNM 2pl‘Did you all get drunk?’ (OS)

food=TELnˆ¤N-a‡ntˆ¤h ?!be.like-DYNM 2pl-OBJ 3sg‘Is it just like food for you all?!’ (B.Cv.90)
Because predicate-focused polar interrogatives require a pronominal subject, the subject
referent can only be referred to by non-pronominal means externally to the interrogative
clause (i.e. in cases where it is not already clear from the discourse):(125) mangá
Margaritatá/-ay,hˆ¤d-a‡nyamhidç/-nˆ¤hREL.INST-INCH 3pl-OBJ sing-NEGtˆ¤h ?
3sg‘What about Margarita, did she sing to them?’ (TD04.Cv)
The interrogative discourse-marker =b’ay (see §17.4.1 above) is very common in
polar questions, where it follows the clause-final subject:
(126) hi-wag-yˆ/-pó-yhˆ¤d=b’ay,FACT-day-TEL-EMPH1-DYNM 3pl=AGAIN/ána?

Negatively biased polar questions are phrased as negative predicates within the
interrogative clause (example 128). A negative polar interrogative can also be used as a
polite invitation (example 129).","[962, 963]"

construction, Counterfactual -tQ)/- may be used in an independent clause to signal an

This ‘avertive’ function of Counterfactual -tQ)/- is reminiscent of that of an
‘avertive’ gram, as defined cross-linguistically by Kuteva (1998, 2001). However, the
morpheme -tQ)/- cannot in general be considered an ‘avertive’ gram according to
Kuteva’s definition (2001: 84), which stresses three ‘essential’ characteristics:counterfactuality, imminence, and past-tense reference. While Hup -tQ)/- shares the746feature of counterfactuality with avertive constructions in other languages, its use in
conditional expressions does not always meet the criterion of imminence, and it is not in
general restricted to past events—whereas Kuteva stresses that “the avertive structure is
restricted to past contexts only”. Cases of Counterfactual -tQ)/- in reference to non-past
events are common, both in clearly conditional expressions like (12-14) above, and in
more ‘avertive’ examples like (28-30):
(28)tˆh nçh-yˆ/-tQ‚ê/-Q‚w-ay
3sg fall-TEL-CNTRFCT-FLR-INCH‘It’s just about to fall.’ (OS)
(29)doh-nˆ¤htˆhni-tQ‚¤ê/-Q‚p=b’aycurse-NEG 3sg be-CNTRFCT-DEP=AGAIN‘He’s on the verge of cursing them again.’ (B-Cv.2.9)

(TD.Cv.101)
Hup -tQ)/- is therefore best considered not an ‘avertive’ gram per se, but rather a
counterfactual irrealis gram that has developed an avertive-type extended function. This
development has undoubtedly come about through the ability of either of the two linked
clauses in a conditional construction to appear by itself, while its companion may be left
unstated when it can be recovered from the discourse. In most of the ‘avertive’ examples
of the Counterfactual’s use above, in fact, a conditional clause (as protasis) and
counterfactual translation could easily be supplied, such as (example 23): ‘you almost
fell’ ~ ‘you would have fallen (if you had not caught yourself)’. Both the ‘avertive’ use
and the more straightforward counterfactual use of -tQ)/- share the interpretation that an747event in the past was not realized at all (because some necessary condition was not
met), or that a non-past event is judged to be unlikely or impossible.
A final observation regarding the ‘avertive’ function of -tQ)/- involves its
behavior in negative contexts, which follows the same rules as its
conditional/counterfactual realization (§14.2.1 above). Because -tQ)/- cannot co-occur
with the verbal Negative suffix -nˆ¤h, an averted negative event can only be expressed
with Frustrative yQ)êh:(31)/ãh wˆdham-nˆ¤h yQ‚êh;g’ˆm-tQ‚ê/-Q‚êyyQ‚êh1sgcapsize-CNTRFCT-DYNMFRUSTarrive.go-NEGFRUST‘I almost didn’t arrive; I almost capsized/ drowned.’ (EL)
As noted in §16.4, -tQ)/- can occur with the reinforcing negative particle nQ¤, which
otherwise is restricted to contexts in which an explicitly negative morpheme is present
(example 32). This is additional evidence that Counterfactual -tQ)/- (at least in its
‘avertive’ function) is itself inherently negative (see §14.2.1 above), which makes sense
given its irrealis function.","[761, 762, 763, 764]"
