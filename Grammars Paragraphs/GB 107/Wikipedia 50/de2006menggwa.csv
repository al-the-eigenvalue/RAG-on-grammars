"335The following table lists the tense-aspect-mood categories associated with
each of the six status-polarity combinations for ordinary verbs (for copulas, see §6.4).
Positive realis and positive irrealis are indicated by zero morphs (but the tenseaspect-mood affixes for positive realis and positive irrealis moods are mutually
exclusive); negative realis (§6.1.3) is conveyd by negative realis verb boke (class I)
or -boka (class II); positive semi-realis (§6.2.1) is conveyd by the positive semirealis verb samby or its bound form -mby/ -mb; negative-semi-realis (§6.2.2) is
conveyd by a particle ga; and negative-irrealis (§6.3) is conveyd by an affix ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m.","[349, 350]"
"6.2SemiSemi-realis status
Semi-realis status encompasses only one tense-mood category — futuredeclarative (other future categories are irrealis; §6.3). Future declarative verbs of
positive and negative polarities have markedly different morphological forms:
positive semi-realis verbs are characterised by a serialised ‘positive semi-realis verb’
366samby (class I) (§6.2.1), whereas negative semi-realis verbs have a negative semirealis particle ga (§6.2.2). Finite verb stems are used for semi-realis verb forms
(§5.1.1), and if the lexical verb lexeme makes a distinction between future versus
non-future finite verb stems (§5.1.2), the future form must be used. The form of the
positive semi-realis verb varies greatly depending on the person-number-gender
features of the subject, and it is difficult to give a general morphological template of
positive semi-realis verbs. In some cases the positive semi-realis verb forms a
separate phonological word from the lexical verb, and in other cases the positive
semi-realis verb forms a phonological word together with the lexical verb (see
§6.2.1). On the other hand, negative semi-realis verbs are morphologically simple in
comparison. Negative semi-realis verb forms begin with a negative semi-realis
particle ga and then followed by a (future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2) together with
its cross-reference suffix(es). The cross-reference suffixes used in negative semirealis verb forms are always class A suffixes (§5.2). The negative semi-relias
particle ga is a separate phonological word.ga(FUTURE) FINITE VERB STEM — CLASS A CROSS-REF SUFFIX(ES)The following verbs exemplify realis versus semi-realis, and positive versus

"Independent verbs carry cross-reference suffixes (§5.2) and other affixes
which indicate tense, mood, status, polarity, and sometimes aspect (§6). There are
three tenses: past, present and future. Three statuses are distinguished: realis (§6.1),
semi-realis (‘certain future’; §6.2) and irrealis (§6.3). Morphology associated with
the three statuses is markedly different, especially the way negatives are formed

Except for copulas (§6.4), there are no verb forms which indicateinterrogative mood specifically. Polarity questions are only distinguished from their
statement counterparts by intonation: statements usually end in low pitch, whereas
questions end in a high pitch (§2.4.2).","[376, 377]"
"Independent verbs are grammatically marked for status1, tense, aspect, mood
and/or polarity. In terms of verbal morphology, the most important categories are
status and polarity (polarity is independent of status in Menggwa Dla), as the overall
morphological structure of a verb is determined first by its status and polarity. A lot
of languages have a binary realis-irrealis status distinction; Mithun (1999:173)
generalises the binary status distinction as follows: ‘The realis portrays situations as
actualized, as having occurred or actually occurring, knowable through direct
perception. The irrealis portrays situations as purely within the realm of thought,
knowable only through imagination’. In addition to realis status and irrealis status,
there is also an in-between status category called ‘semi-realis’ in Menggwa Dla,
which signifies that on one hand it is like irrealis in that the situation is imagined,
but on the other hand it is like realis in that the speaker is conveying his/ her
certainty over the realisation (positive future declarative) or non-realisation (negative
future declarative) of the situation.",[349]

be the time of utterance (absolute tense) or the time of some other clause (relative
tense). Three tenses are distinguished: past, present and future tense. Present tense
in Menggwa Dla conveys present time or near present time. Near present time
refers to immediate past time or immediate future time, in other words time which is
considered by the speaker to be near the present time, typically no more than a few
minutes away from the present time. Correspondingly, past tense and future tense
convey non-immediate past time and non-immediate future time respectively. If the
progression of time is represented by a horizontal line running from left to right, and
the time of utterance by an × on the horizontal time line, this is how the tenses in
Menggwa Dla dissect the time line:2‘Time of utterance’ and ‘present time’ here refer to the time of utterance in real time or the time of
utterance of a direct quote.","[350, 351]"
"4347.1.2.1Realis -hwani ‘when’ clauses
A realis -hwani verb has a (non-future) finite verb stem (§5.1.1-2), subset Across-reference suffix(es) (§5.2), and a -hwani ‘when’ suffix at the end. With realis-hwani clauses, the situation is known by the speaker as having occurred (positive
polarity) or not occurred (negative polarity), or habitually occurring (positive) or
habitually not occurring (negative), and the situation of the matrix clause begins
after the inchoation point of the situation of the -hwani clause. The use of
subordinate realis -hwani clauses is rather rare, for that sequential meaning is mostly
conveyed by chain clauses (§7.2). A realis -hwani clause is used as the final clause
of a non-finite clause chain or when it is followed by non-finite chain clauses (and
non-finite chain clauses themselves are rather rare; §7.3.1). In a non-finite chain
clause, the subject must be coreferential with the subject of the following clause in
the clause chain. On the other hand, the subject of a -hwani clause must be disjointreferential with the subject of its matrix clause. In effect, a non-finite chain verb
and a realis -hwani verb is the coreferential (CR) and disjoint-referential (DR) verb
forms — respectively — of a switch-reference (SR) system. Nevertheless, this nonfinite/ -hwani SR system is used much less often than the chain clause SR system.
(See §7.2 on chain clauses and §7.3.1 on non-finite chain clauses.)In the following examples, the clauses preceding the -hwani clauses are nonfinite chain clauses; in example 7-48 the -hwani clause is followed by another nonfinite chain clause, and in example 7-49 the -hwani clause is followed by an
independent clause. Notice the change in subject between the realis -hwani clause
and the following matrix clause in both examples.","[448, 449]"
"451two adjacent clauses are coreferential but the first clause is in negative polarity, the
first clause cannot be a chain clause (a subordinate (§7.1) or independent clause (§6)
can be used instead).","[465, 466]"
"8While the negative semi-realis verb form remains unchanged: the negative semi-realis particle ga

"The negative form of a DR chain verb is formed by serialising a negative verbboke (class I) or boka (class II) in DR chain verb form to a non-finite form of the
lexical verb; class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs take boke (which takes class I crossreference suffixes), whereas class II and III lexical verbs take boka (which takes
class II cross-reference suffixes). This is formally the same as the negative realis
verb boke/ boka used in independent clauses (§5.1.3). Nevertheless, the chain clause
negative verb boke/ boka does not indicate status, unlike the independent clause
negative realis verb boke/ boka which indicates realis status. The following are
examples of positive CR chain verbs, positive DR chain verbs and negative DR chain
verbs in different verb classes. Notice the changes in the cross-reference suffixes,
especially when the negative verb boke (class I)/ boka (class II) is used. The class

the eastern villages of Menggau and Wahai, but not in western villages of
Wanggurinda and Menggwal, there is a trend of the negative irrealis suffix (ma-/ -ma/ -me/ -m; §6.3) being used to indicate negative realis.8 These innovative
negative realis verb forms are formed by the positive realis verb form (e.g. example
6-70) affixed by a negative irrealis affix, which now also indicates negative realis
(e.g. example 6-69b, compare this with the conservative negative realis form 6-69a).

negative irrealis affix, the speaker is not biased towards the positive or negative
outcome by using a future tentative verb. Future tentative verb forms are formed by
a future finite verb stem, a negative irrealis affix (§6), a set of cross-reference
suffixes, and optionally a tentative suffix -ni. The sets of cross-referencing used are

"Other than having defective paradigms (as they cannot have object crossreference suffixes other than -a (3FSG:O)), these monovalent class IIB verbs have the
same formation as other class IIB verbs. Most importantly, these monovalent
transitive class IIB verb lexemes form the realis negative form in the same manner as
other bivalent class IIB verb lexemes. The realis negative form of class IIB verb
lexemes are formed with the lexical verb lexeme in its non-finite verb form followed
by the realis negative verb boke (class I). In other words, negative realis clauses
with a class lexical IIB verb would only have one cross-reference suffix, i.e. they can
be intransitive as class I verbs only have one cross-reference suffix. The following

completive verb fefi (fa-) is serialised with apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) which only has
one semantic argument; the 3FSG object suffix -a on the completive verb is

A negative realis independent clause is formed by the lexical verb in its non-finite form (§5.1.1) followed by a negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class
II). Whether boke or boka is used depends on the verb class membership (§5.2) of
the lexical verb: for class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs, boke (class I) is used; for class
II and III lexical verbs, boka (class II) is used. Class IH, IIB and III lexical verbs
have mismatching classes of cross-reference suffixes between positive and negative
realis verb forms: in positive realis, the finite lexical verb stem itself controls the
class membership of the cross-reference suffixes; in negative realis, it is the negative
realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II) which controls the membership of the
cross-reference suffixes. The following table summarises the class of crossreference suffix used in positive realis verb form versus negative realis verb form.","[370, 371]"

Verbs in semi-realis status are statements which convey the speaker’sabsolute certainty that a proposition will hold in the future, and that the speaker is
committed to the truth value of of the proposition. Semi-realis sentences cannot be
used as questions; future tense questions are in irrealis mood (§6.3). The following
are a few examples of clauses with verbs in semi-realis status.","[386, 387, 388, 389, 390]"
"7.2.1Form of chain verbs
All chain verbs carry a cross-reference morpheme indicating that its subjectis coreferential (CR) or disjoint-referential (DR) with the subject of a following clause
(see §7.2.2 on the syntax of switch-reference). Chain verbs which indicate
coreference of subjects between clauses are called CR chain verbs, and chain verbs
which indicate disjoint-reference of subjects between clauses are called DR chain
verbs. There are a number of morphosyntactic differences between CR chain verbs
and DR chain verbs: a) CR chain verbs have a zero CR morph, whereas DR chain
verbs have a ma-/ -ma or -me DR affix; b) CR chain verbs carry subset B crossreferencing (§5.2), whereas DR chain verbs carry subset A cross-referencing, with the
exception of class IIB verbs which must take subset B cross-referencing regardless
(§5.2.2); c) CR chain verbs must be in positive in polarity, whereas DR chain verbs
can be in positive or negative polarity;10 d) CR chain verbs can be serialised with the
completive verb fefi (fa-) ~ mefi (ma-)/ me and the sequential verb nuŋgu
(nu[mb/ŋg]-) (§7.4), whereas DR chain verbs cannot be serialised with these verbs;
10If two clauses have coreferential subjects and the first clause is in negative polarity, then the first
clause cannot be a (CR or DR) chain clause; the first clause must be an independent clause, e.g.:

‘He j came here but he j did not go into the house. He j/k sat outside the house, and…’445and e) as for the dependency suffix, CR chain verbs usually take -Ø or -mbo,
whereas DR chain verbs usually take -mbo or -mbona (see §7.5); -mbona is rare with
CR chain verbs and -Ø is rare with DR chain verbs.","[459, 460]"

"Negative non-future copulas and the future interrogative copulas have the
same forms (e.g. both have the non-finite form me). This unification suggest that
with copulas, negativity is semantically subordinate to the status of irrealis, unlike
other verbs where negativity is independent from status (§6.1; §6.2; §6.3). Negative
non-future/ future interrogative copulas have a class IB cross-reference suffix, except399that when the subject is first person singular (1SG), the class IA suffix of -aha is used
instead (some younger speakers pronounce this suffix as -aya). The negative nonfuture/ future interrogative copula stem is me, except when the following crossreference suffix begins with a, then the copula stem is m. This allomorphy is
identical with that of the negative irrealis affix (§6.3).","[413, 414]"

can also be followed by gwa ‘but’ (§3.2.6), the exclamatory particle ke or the
cautionary particle we (see below)). The word ini ‘yes’ is used to indicate
agreement or existence (ini ‘yes’ is used in agreement with a negatively-polarised
question), whereas awe ‘no’ is used to indicate non-agreement or non-existence (in
example 3-151 below, awe ‘no’ signifies non-existence rather than non-agreement to
a statement raised by someone).3-150. “gapo-l-afa?”","[193, 194, 195]"
"7.2.1.1The DR affix and irregular DR verb forms
The most salient difference between DR and CR chain verbs is that CR verbforms have a zero CR morph, whereas DR chain verbs have an overt DR affix.
Usually, the DR affix comes in the form of ma-, -ma or -me. The DR morph has the
same allomorphy as the negative irrealis affix (§6.3).11 However, some verb
lexemes have irregular DR chain verb forms and/or irregular negative irrealis verb11There is also an -m allomorph of the negative irrealis affix. However, -m is only used when
followed by a subset B cross-reference suffix (§5.2), and DR chain verbs only take subset A crossreference suffixes, so -m is not used with DR chain verbs.",[461]
"FINITE VERB STEM — CROSS-REF SUFFIX(ES) — TA SUFFIXNegative realis verbs are formed with the lexical verb in its non-finite form plus a
following negative realis verb boke (class I) or boka (class II). The non-finite verb
stem (§5.1.1) of the lexical verb and the negative realis verb boke/ boka are separate
phonological words. Class I, IH and IIB lexical verbs take boke, while class II and
III lexical verbs take boka. The class of cross-reference suffixes used, however, are
338determined by the verb class of the negative realise verb boke and boka: boke is a
class I verb, and boka is a class II verb. See §6.1.3 for more discussions on negative
realis verb forms.","[352, 353]"
"Nevertheless, there are verb lexemes with irregular negative irrealis affixes,

infix [ma]: si[ma]ha-. Except for verb lexemes which have irregular negative379irrealis affix and/ or irregular disjoint-referential affix (§7.2.1), the negative irrealis

Future tentative mood verb forms can also be used for questions in futuretense. We have seen that future declaratives are expressed by semi-realis verb forms
(§6.2). Future interrogatives, however, must be in irrealis status. The future
tentative verb form is used for both content questions (question word questions) and
polarity questions (yes-no questions). The following are some examples of content
questions in future tense.6-150. dani=hya=naga=napo-ma-afu?here=ABL=TOP where=ALL go:FUT-NEG:IR-2SG

the form of polarity questions also convey indirect commands or exhortations in the
right contexts (mainly when the subject is the addressee). Commands and
exhortations expressed by future tentative verb forms are less direct and more polite
than commands or exhortations expressed by imperative verb forms (§6.3.1).6-155. byama-dom-afu.coconut NEG:IR-drink:FUT-2SG

Counterfactual mood conveys that the polarity of the proposition is oppositeto what has actually occurred. Counterfactual verb forms have a non-future finite
verb, a counterfactual suffix -naho at the end of the verb, and cross-reference
suffix(es) in between:
•class IB/ IHB cross-reference suffix(es) for class I and IH verb stems;•class IIB subject plus class IIB object suffixes for class IIB verb stems;•class IIA subject plus class IIB object suffixes for class II verb stems; and•class III subject plus class IIIB object suffixes for class III verb stems.","[402, 403, 404, 405, 406]"

"There are two grammatical case clitics in Menggwa Dla: object case =mbo
(§4.5.1) and genitive case =la (§4.5.2); subjects and second objects are zero casemarked. There are four local cases: inessive case =mbe (‘in’/ ‘from inside’, ‘to
inside’), adessive case =hi/ =sehi (‘on’), allative case =na(mbo) (‘to’) and ablative
case =hya (‘from’) (see §4.5.3). There is actually another local case: perlative case=roŋgo (‘through’). However, it is also often used to mean ‘together’, similar to
210the comitative case =lofo (see §4.5.4). There are also the proprietive case =mbi
and abessive case =mboka, meaning ‘have’/ ‘exist’ and ‘not have’/ ‘not exist’
respectively (see §4.5.5). There are three non-case nominal clitics: the topic clitic=na (§4.5.6) and the focus clitics =amba ‘also’ and =pa ‘only’ (§4.5.7). The
following is a table summarising the nominal clitics, and any corresponding verbal
affixes in Menggwa Dla. See also §6.1 for discussions on the grammaticalisation of
certain case clitics into verbal suffixes and grammatical verbs.

particles or affixes. Firstly, the nominal clitics are attached to the last independent
word in a noun phrase (or other clitics if the noun phrase has more than one clitic);
the clitics are not attached to words of any particular word classes. (Unlike the
corresponding verbal suffix which is always attached to verbs.)4-59. wali imbu=na/
pigtwo=TOPimbu wali=na
twopig=TOP‘As for the two pigs’10Secondly, case clitics which begin with /b/ are prenasalised [mb], which indicates
that the phoneme /b/ in these clitics is considered word-medial rather than wordinitial (§2.1.3.2). Thirdly, the case clitics (sometimes) form part of the stress and
pitch domain of their phonological host (see §2.4).","[224, 225, 226]"
"6.4.1Copulas
Copula is a special class of verb in Menggwa Dla. Like other verbs, copulasalso have finite forms which carry cross-referencing and non-finite forms which do
not. However, as the main verb of a clause, finite copulas only head independent
clauses (§6), and the non-finite copulas only head non-finite chain clauses (§7.3.2)
(copulas are not used as the main verb of subordinate clauses (§7.1) and chain
clauses (§7.2); see also §6.4.3 on auxiliary copulas). Moreover, finite copulas mark
less tense-aspect-mood categories than ordinary verbs, and the way tense-aspectmood-polarity categories are expressed in copulas is also mostly different from those
in ordinary verbs (§6.1-3). The following table summarises the copulas in Menggwa
Dla; the copulas are introduced in the listed order in the rest of this section.",[408]

Protases, in other words the ‘if’ clauses of conditional sentences, can bemarked in two different ways. Simple indicative protases, of which the truth value
can be true or false, are expressed as irrealis -hwani clauses (§7.1.2). On the other
hand, hypothetical protases, in other words protases of which the polarity must be
false based on real word knowledge, are indicated by chain clauses. The

Non-finite chain clauses and verbal nouns are rare in natural discourse. Non-finite chain verbs and verbal nouns are formally nearly identical; non-finite chain
verbs are formed with a non-finite verb stem (§5.1.1), an optional ‘posterior’ suffix -mba, and a dependency suffix -Ø ~ -mbo ~ -mbona; verbal nouns are formed with a
non-finite verb stem, an optional posterior suffix -mba, and a nominalising suffix -Ø
~ -mbo. In addition, verbal noun phrases can also take certain case clitics (§4.5).
Neither non-finite chain verbs nor verbal carry cross-reference suffixes (§5.2). The
meaning of the ‘posterior’ suffix -mba is different depending on whether it is used
on non-finite chain verbs or verbal nouns, see §7.3.1 and §7.3.2 respectively.","[492, 493, 494]"

like the realis negative verb boke (class I)/ boka (class II) (§§6.1.3) or the
completive verb fefi (fa-) (class IIB) (§7.4), the lexical verb must be (for realis
negative) or can be (for completive) in the non-finite form. The following is an
example of a negative realis serial verb form.35-3.(hamani)apu boke-aha-hwa.(yesterday) sleep NEG:R-1SG-PAST

Most verb lexemes have only one finite verb stem which is used in allenvironments where a finite verb stem is required (§5.1.1). The following are
examples of the verb apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) in past tense (§6.1.2), present tense
continuous aspect (§6.1.1) and future tense (§6.2). The finite verb stem remains
invariant for apu (ap-) ‘sleep’ (class I) and most other verb lexemes.","[275, 276]"
"Prohibitive mood is the semantic negative counterpart of imperative-jussive
mood (§6.3.1). Prohibitive verb forms are non-finite as well; they do not carry any
cross-reference suffixes. Prohibitive verbs are formed by prefixing a negative
irrealis prefix ma- (§6) and suffixing a cautious mood suffix -e ~ -we (see above) to
a non-finite verb stem.",[399]
"Despite having three or more undergoer referents, the undergoer reference is
always cross-referenced as singular if the undergoer reference is cross-referenced on
the verb. With mass undergoer verbs, the individual identities of the inanimate
undergoer referents are not pragmatically salient, and the group of undergoer
referents is viewed as one single mass rather than plural individuals. Take the
example of bi ‘hold’ (class II), of which the mass undergoer counterpart is bibi
‘hold’ (class II). To convey ‘I am holding string bags’, one can simply use the nonmass undergoer verb bi, and if the undergoer referents — the string bags — are low
in discourse saliency, the undergoers can be cross-referenced by a number-neutral
3FSG cross-reference suffix (§5.2.4).

‘I am holding string bags.’ (-ha-a class IIA)If the three or more undergoer referents are for some reason very salient in
the discourse, then the undergoers can be cross-referenced as plural. However, the
non-mass undergoer verb bi must be used, as the undergoer can only be crossreferenced as singular in a mass undergoer verb.5-22. alubi-ha-ti-hwa.string.bag hold-1SG-N1FPL:O-PAST
‘I was holding string bags.’If the undergoer reference is specified as having two referents, the undergoer
can be cross-referenced as singular if the undergoer is not salient (see §5.2.4), or
‘correctly’ cross-referenced as dual. A non-mass undergoer verb must be used as271mass undergoer verbs indicate that the undergoer reference has three or more
referents.5-23. aluimbu bi-ha-a-hwa.string.bag twohold-1SG-3FSG:O-PAST‘I was holding two string bags.’5-24. aluimbu bi-ha-pa-hwa.string.bag twohold-1SG-N1DU:O-PAST‘I was holding two string bags.’Mass undergoer verbs cannot be in negative polarity. The negative
counterpart of both examples 5-20 (non-mass undergoer) and 5-21 (mass undergoer)
has to be formed from the non-mass undergoer verb lexeme (see §6.1.3 on realis
negation).5-25. alubiboka-ha-a-hi.string.bag hold NEG:R-1SG-3FSG:O-PRES:CONT
‘I am not holding string bags.’ (-ha-a class IIA)The use of mass undergoer verbs is not obligatory. Whether the undergoer
noun phrase is overt or covert, or whether the undergoer noun phrase is quantified or
not has no influence over whether a mass undergoer verb or a non-mass undergoer
verb is used. This optionality is further demonstrated in the following example. In
the first clause the verb pupuhwa ‘we plucked feathers, and…’ is formed from the272non-mass undergoer verb lexeme pupu. In the second clause, the verb pupuahwehi
‘we plucked feathers, and…’ is formed from the mass undergoer verb lexeme pupu-ahwe. The two clauses depict the same situation.5-26. ninala pupu-Ø-hwa-a-Ø,

section. The following lists of mass undergoer verbs are probably not exhaustive, as
the use of mass undergoer verbs are optional, and speakers’ repertoires of mass
undergoer verbs vary. Mass undergoer verb lexemes are derived from their nonmass undergoer counterpart. However, the derivation process is not productive and
not predictable, and only some mass undergoer verb lexemes have a clearly
segmentable mass undergoer affix.","[284, 285, 286, 287]"

copular sentences (§6.4). Clauses in Menggwa Dla are most usually verb final, but
it is not uncommon to find a single noun phrase occupying the post-verbal position.
Copulas form a special class of verbs in Menggwa Dla. Essentially, copulas have
one or more class I cross-reference suffixes (§5.2.1), and they mark less status, tense,
mood and polarity categories than independent verbs.","[351, 352]"

‘We will go.’Semi-realis verb forms convey the speaker’s absolute certainty that the
situation will occur in the future, and jussive forms convey slight coercion. On the
other hand, posterior chain verbs — which depict situations posterior to the time of
utterance — are relatively polite in that they are semantically vague; they do not
indicate the speaker’s attitude towards the proposition (i.e. devoid of modal
meaning), and the actor of the situation does not have to be expressed. The

"The situation of an irrealis -hwani clause is imagined by the speakers, and the
