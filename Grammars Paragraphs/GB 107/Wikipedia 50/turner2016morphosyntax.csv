"Waag (2012:4) suggests that although ca is clearly related to the verb, it may havegrammaticalized in certain contexts and so includes c- in her table of case aﬃxes as‘direction to’ (Waag 2012:6). In the draft Katcha New Testament, ca is commonly
glossed as ‘to’, rather than ‘go’, which may suggest some native speaker intuition in
this direction. In regard to its interaction with personal pronouns, Waag places ca
in the third group, those which take core 1st and 2nd person pronouns but oblique
3rd person pronouns. As just noted, I was unable to conﬁrm this. If Waag’s data
is accurate, this would clearly distinguish ca it from locative ká, which takes oblique
forms throughout.
The third possibility is that ca is a variant of the verb acɔ ‘go’. This is the view taken
by Stevenson (1941:74). As evidence, he cites the negative imperative form, though the
argument is somewhat opaque, consisting of three example sentences and the statement,
‘the negative imperative indicates that no preposition is involved.’ (Stevenson 1941:74)
In the draft Katcha New Testament this morpheme, which is most frequently realised110Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsphonetically as /ca/ is invariably spelled as ‘co’. This may suggest some native speaker
intuition that it is at least related to the verb. More signiﬁcantly, it is not unusual for
the (fully inﬂected) verb form acɔ to follow another verb of motion. Generally this isʊ́ŋkéːne.5 The combination ʊ́ŋkéːne acɔ occurs frequently, often expressing the notion
of leaving or setting out to go somewhere as in (6.45). It may be that ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́ acɔ is
also a licit combination of verbs, and that ca following the verb of motion in (6.21) is
in fact a form of the verb acɔ.(6.45) unggeene aaco

‘he set oﬀ for a distant country.’(LUK 15.13)My tentative analysis is to take the third position and to treat ca as a verb form.
One of the additional pieces of evidence for this analysis comes from looking more
carefully at its complement. In (6.18-6.19), the verb acɔ seems to take a direct object.
However, in (6.45) it appears to be followed by the dative marker a. This is a patternthat is repeated throughout the corpus of written Katcha. For example, in the Gospel
of Luke, there are 31 examples of acɔ followed directly by a (consonant-initial) nominal
object, but 6 examples of acɔ followed by dative a before the noun. The ‘preposition’ca/cɔ shows a similar pattern. There are 33 examples in Luke of cɔ followed directly by
a (consonant-initial) nominal object, but 15 examples of cɔ followed by dative a before
the noun. There is no obvious pattern to the presence or absence of the dative a; I
leave aside the question of whether there is a pattern yet to be discovered, whether it
is genuinely optional or whether there is simply an orthographic inconsistency.6 The
relevant fact is that the ‘preposition’ ca/cɔ displays the same behaviour as the verb
acɔ.
During ﬁeldwork, no examples of cɔ with personal pronouns were elicited; according
to the Katcha speakers I worked with, it is not possible for cɔ to be followed by a
personal pronoun. This contrasts with Waag’s (2012:6) description of c- as belonging
to the third type of preposition, which take core 1st and 2nd person pronouns but
oblique 3rd person pronouns. In the draft Katcha New Testament there are very few
examples of cɔ followed by a pronoun. The only attested examples are all with the 3rd
person masculine oblique pronoun ɪːnɪ (written with a lenghtened initial vowel). There
is insuﬃcient data to be conclusive, but one plausible speculation is that the reason
I was unable to elicit a cɔ+pronoun sequence when asking for it directly is that such
5
ʊ́ŋkéːne is a non-goal-directed verb of motion (‘go oﬀ, go out, wander’) and contrasts with ʊ́ŋkʊ́nʊ́
which implies a goal or destination (‘go to’).
6
Given the fact that Katcha vowels so frequently undergo processes of harmony and/or ellision, it
is plausible that these examples contain an underlying a that has been ellided and that the translators
may have been inconsistent in whether or not they have included it in the transcription.","[128, 129]"
"1.2 Morphosyntactic Descriptions
The language description focuses on the nominal system. The ﬁrst half, chapters 4 and
5, focuses on the role of nominals as heads, considering phenomena such as classiﬁcation,
agreement and modiﬁcation. The second half, chapters 6 and 7, focuses on nominals as
dependents and arguments, considering phenomena such as prepositional phrases, case
and verbal valency.
Chapter 4 describes nominal classiﬁcation in Katcha. Katcha has an interaction
between the categories of Number and Gender which is typologically unusual and is
also relevant to the wider debate about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family.
The chapter begins with a discussion of number marking, presenting the variety of
singulative and plurative preﬁxes with which number is marked on Katcha nouns. It is1.2. Morphosyntactic Descriptions5demonstrated that these show the typically Nilo-Saharan characteristic of occuring in
a tripartite distribution, where some nouns take plurative aﬃxes, some take singulative
aﬃxes and some take both. However, it is also demonstrated that among the third
group are nouns which show the typically Niger-Congo characteristic of occuring in
classes which have a semantic basis and are indicated morphologically by their number
aﬃxes. Following the discussion of number is a discussion of gender, which establishes
that agreement in Katcha is based on three gender classes, and not on two gender
classes plus plural number as has sometimes been suggested. Having described number
marking and gender classiﬁcation, the discussion moves on to the interaction between
these two categories. It is shown that for morphologically number-marked nouns the
aﬃx, rather than the noun root, assigns gender to the noun. This can result in ‘polarity’
where the gender of a noun in the singular may be diﬀerent from its gender in the
plural. Interestingly, polarity is most commonly found in Afro-Asiatic, meaning that
the number system shows some properties of all three North-East African language
phyla. Finally, this chapter argues that the semantic basis of the third gender class is
the notion of plurality and that Katcha is best described as having a three-class gender
system of Masculine, Feminine and Plural. Such systems have been argued to exist in
some Cushitic languages, but to my knowledge this is the ﬁrst time it has ever been
recorded outwith that language family.
Chapter 5 presents a description and uniﬁed analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers, of
which there are three main types: demonstratives, possessors and relative clauses. It is
noted that in each case, nominal modiﬁers display gender agreement with the modiﬁed
noun, carry morphological marking when the modiﬁed noun is a peripheral argument
of the verb, and occur in ‘headless’ constructions where there is no overt noun to be
modiﬁed (in which case they have a pronominal interpretation). It is then argued that
nominal modiﬁers are all demonstrative pronouns, or phrases headed by demonstrative
pronouns, which are appositional to the modiﬁed noun. With the exception of the
medial and distal demonstratives, all modiﬁers are introduced by morphemes of a
similar form. Phonological evidence is presented that suggests that these occur in
complementary distribution and are therefore allomorphs. It is then argued that this
modifying morpheme is the proximal demonstrative pronoun, allowing the incorporation of the medial and distal demonstratives into the same system and explaining
why the latter have a diﬀerent form, but identical distribution to all other nominal
modiﬁers. This chapter ﬁnishes with some cross-linguistic perspective by discussing
the relationship between the analysis of Katcha outlined here and two notions which
have been argued to be appropriate to a number of African languages: the ‘relative
marker’ and the ‘construct state’. It is suggested that both of these typically African
constructions may result from grammaticalization of the demonstrative pronoun which
heads the nominal modiﬁer.","[23, 24]"
"9.6. Case markers215constrain the further development of the tree and therefore decorate the node with
requirements. The strong negation operator (¬) is persistent (Kempson et al. 2001:289290): the statements it scopes over (⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t) and ⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)) hold for the
current partial tree but also for all subsequent tree developments. Thus the use of
requirements ensures that these conditions will be met at all subsequent stages of the
parse, most importantly at the ﬁnal evaluation of the tree.11
Contrastingly, the ﬁrst disjunct does not place any restrictions on future tree growth,
it depends only on the presence of a particular morpheme (the applicative) in the
immediately preceding context. It is therefore modelled as a condition within the lexical
entry, allowing the parse to proceed only if the applicative morpheme has already been
parsed. This action of checking the Formula value of the the predicate may seem
stipulative, but this is simply a way of formalising lexical selection. The traditional
way of describing lexical selection would be to say that an applicative verb selects a
dative complement, but it is equally feasible to express the inverse - a dative noun
is licensed by the presence of an applicative verb - and this is what the lexical entry
expresses.12
A similar process of lexical selection takes place when personal pronouns occur as
the complement of prepositions. As noted in chapter 6 there are two sets of personal
pronouns, which may be described as ‘Core’ and ‘Oblique’. When used as a prepositional
complement, the form of the pronoun is determined by the preposition. This selection
is strongly lexical: many prepositions do not select only one type of pronoun, but ‘mix
and match’ from the two sets. This makes it hard to deﬁne any pronominal feature
which the lexical entry might subcategorize for. The best way to model this lexical
stipulation is therefore to encode it within the lexical entry of the pronoun. This will
mean the lexical entry for the pronoun has to be multiply disjunctive, but since there
are a limited number of prepositions the disjunction will not be implausibly large.
For example, (9.45) gives a possible lexical entry for the 3rd person masculine oblique
personal pronoun ɪnɪ ́:
(9.45) Lexical entry for ɪnɪ ́
11Though in fact, in the case of (9.43b-c) the node has a ﬁxed address and so the requirements are
satisﬁed immediately.
12
In section 6.5 it was stated that most verbs do not select the forms of their arguments and this was
given as a reason for thinking of oblique role markers as prepositions rather than case markers. Here
we see an exception in that applicative verbs do select the form of their complement. This is further
support for the argument (which came initially from the theoretical analysis) that a should be thought
of as a dative case marker rather than a preposition.","[233, 234]"
"6.1.1 Pronoun Set 1 - ‘Core’ pronouns
The primary function of the ﬁrst set of pronouns is to express the core arguments of a
sentence: the subject and the direct object (i.e. argument roles S, A and P). For this
reason, this set may be referred to as the Core pronouns. However as will be seen in
section 6.2, these forms also appear with certain prepositions, so they do also express
some peripheral arguments.
There are eight forms of the core pronouns, listed in (6.1). The 1st and 2nd person
pronouns distinguish singular and plural, while in the case of 1st person plural there is
a further distinction according to the inclusion or exclusion of the addressee. There are
three 3rd person pronouns, distinguishing grammatical gender (Masculine, Feminine
and Plural gender).
(6.1) ‘Core’ personal pronouns (tone not marked)
1sga a1pl.excl
1pl.inclʊŋːɔaŋːa2sgɔ ɔ2plaːka3mɪ ɪ3peːke3fɔːkɔThe forms given in (6.1) are the citation forms. In everyday use, however, they are
often subject to shortening and/or lenition. The presence of the glottal stop in the 1sg,
2sg and 3m forms is notable as these are the only words in which the glottal stop is
attested as a consonant of the language. However, in non-emphatic contexts the glottal
stop is frequently dropped and the pronouns realised as /aː/, /ɔː/ and /ɪː/ (or even
shortened to /a/, etc). Similarly (though less frequently), the 2pl and 3p forms may
be realised as /a:/ or /e:/.1
The pronominal forms in (6.1) are listed without reference to tone. The tone pattern
of core pronouns varies and it appears that this variation may be due to the pronoun’s
function in the sentence. That is, pronouns seem to be marked tonally for case. Where
the pronoun is the subject of its clause, it has a Low-Low melody, as in the second
clause of (6.2); where the pronoun is not the subject of its clause, it is more likely to

this pronoun occurs much less frequently in my data.",[115]
"The main use of tone seems to be grammatical. This seems to be true for Kadu as a
whole: ‘[The] most frequent use of tone and/or stress to distinguish between otherwise
similar words is grammatical, diﬀerentiating between diﬀerent forms of the verb’ (Hall
and Hall 2004:7). In chapter 6 the possibility is discussed that tone distinctions are used
to mark case in Katcha, at least on pronouns. Tone is also used to distinguish between
certain verb aspects (parallel versus antecedent events), though these fall outwith the
scope of the current study.
Hall and Hall (2004) also suggest a possible connection between tone and stress:
‘It has also been noted that heightened tone and loudness have a strong tendency to
co-occur’ (Hall and Hall 2004:7). This is true for Katcha, certainly on a phrasal level.
It is my impression that there is usually one syllable per ‘intonational domain’ which
carries a higher tone and is louder than all others. This syllable appears to be the most
stressed or focussed within the phrase. I leave open the question of what constitutes an
‘intonational domain’ and what role the focussed syllable has within it, but in chapter
5 it is noted that this kind of phenomenon seems to be intonational, associated with a
pause or with contrast.
Hall (2006:179) observes for Kamda that a ‘signiﬁcant amount of pitch conditioning
is evident.’ He lists a number of Kamda constructions in which the tones of the noun
are changed by the presence of a particular particle or aﬃx. This is also something
that occurs in Katcha. Some conditioning is easy to account for, such as the fact
that the normally low tone on the ﬁrst syllable of an oblique pronoun becomes high
following the high tone locative preposition (section 6.2.2). Other conditioning is much
more complex, so I have attempted to mark the surface form of tone as accurately as
possible throughout this study. As noted above though, vowels are frequently elided in
Katcha; in these cases I have marked the underlying tone (and indeed, the underlying
vowel) where it is known.",[49]
"11.3.3 Grammar and lexicon
Dynamic Syntax deﬁnes two types of syntactic rules: computational actions and lexical
actions. The balance between them is explicitly lexicalist. That is, computational
actions are limited in number, general, optional and are universally available across languages, while language-speciﬁc idiosyncracies are associated with the actions of speciﬁc
lexical items. In section 9.2 it was noted that bare relatives in English pose something
of a challenge to DS because there is no overt morpheme to trigger the transition to a
relative clause. The choice of analysis is therefore between positing a phonologically null
lexical item (as per Cann et al. (2005:114)) or a language-idiosyncratic computational
rule (as per Kempson et al. (2001:117)), neither of which sit well with the principles
of Dynamic Syntax. This choice raises the question of how to evaluate the cost of an
extra computational rule: how willing should we be to posit new computational rules
(and is it worse than positing a silent grammatical marker)?
One way towards answering this question might be to consider the likelihood of
ﬁnding constructions which might require new computational rules to account for them.
If the lexicalist model of grammar is correct, there should be a limited number of
computational actions and most of them should be relevant in most languages. Given
enough cross-linguistic data, it should be possible in theory to develop an exhaustive
list. At the same time, if computational actions are genuinely optional, the possibility
must be left open that there may be some rules which are used only rarely.",[279]
"In the case of arelative clause, this allows any verb to construct and decorate the restrictor node freely.
However, the value of the logical subject is already ﬁxed, it is necessarily identiﬁed with
the head noun. Thus a verb can only decorate the restrictor node directly when its
subject is identiﬁed with the modiﬁed noun; only subjects can be relativised directly.
In this, Katcha obeys the generalisations of Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility
Hierarchy, which states that subjects are more easily accessible to relativisation than
other NP positions, that positions on the hierarchy lower than subject may require to
be relativised using constructions other than the language’s ‘primary Relative Clauseforming strategy’, and that the alternative strategies are more likely to include the
use of resumptive pronouns. Interestingly, while Keenan and Comrie (1977) suggest a10.4. Non-subject Relative Clauses247psychological motivation for the hierarchy, the analysis of demonstratives given here
predicts (at least some aspects of) this observation from a formal, syntactic perspective.
As noted above, the ﬁnal analysis of non-subject relatives is likely to rest on the
analysis of the dependent clause marker, ka. Furthermore, any such analysis will
have to take into consideration the fact that the verb of the relative clause cannot
decorate the predicate/restrictor node directly. One possible approach is hinted at
by the connection between relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, mentioned in
section 10.3. It was noted there that possessives may be considered a type of relative,
but the inverse may also be considered to be true. Indeed, the morphological similarity
between the Katcha possessive construction and the non-subject relative construction
is quite noticable, to the extent that Stevenson (1956-57:64) states that for the nonsubject relative, ‘a genitive construction (with genitive particle or possessive pronoun)
is used’. It was suggested in chapter 5 that given the non-ﬁnite nature of non-subject
relatives, and given their appositional nature, an appropriate paraphrase of the noun
phrase in sentences such as (10.29) is to use constructions along the lines of ‘the hen
of Kuku’s seeing her.’ This is a reasonable position to adopt reﬂecting as it does the
morphological link between the ‘possessive particle’ and the ‘relativiser’, as well as
reﬂecting the non-ﬁnite nature of the verb.
One possible strategy for the analysis of non-subject relatives, then, might be to
see the non-ﬁnite clause as a nominalisation. The entire clause would then provide an
argument for the predicate represented in section 10.3 as P OSSD. If the predicate is
merely a ‘relation whose value is constructed from some contextually provided value’
(Kempson et al. 2001:145), it may be too restrictive to think of it as possession. In that
case, there is no reason why the relation should not hold between the referent of the
head noun and some more abstract entity, such as an event of seeing. Such an approach
would lead to a ﬁnal epsilon-structure along the lines of that sketched in (10.31), where
the internal structure of ϵx , Hen′ (x) is suppressed, SEEING′ is shorthand for some event
of Kuku seeing some object, and P OSSD is the relation that holds between this event
and x.","[265, 266]"
"Neither areunambiguous. To give an example, the noun phrase kadu nyeꞌdꞌde... in (7.20) appearsto be a potential candidate for the agent of kussudene. The sentence would thenmean ‘God’s wisdom is known by all who accept God’s words’. However, we cannot
discount the possibility that this noun phrase plays a more oblique semantic role, such
as cause. That is, ‘God’s wisdom is known because of those who accept his words’,
with the knower(s) being an implied third party. Indeed, if the English translation and
the Katcha translation accurately paraphrase the same proposition, the latter is the
favoured reading.

‘God’s wisdom is shown to be true by all who accept it.’(LUKE 7:35)It seems then that the agent of a passive construction is made explicit very rarely, if at
all. If the agent of an event is important enough to the discourse to be made explicit,
the passive suﬃx is unlikely to be used. An analysis of discourse structure lies outwith
the scope of this study, but given that syntactic subjects can occur after the verb as
well as before, it is perhaps a plausible speculation that word order, rather than verbal
morphology, is the device used to signal the relative prominence of verbal arguments.
3
There are in fact 202 instances of words carrying the -tene passive suﬃx, but a number of these
are derived nominal forms, such as katalaadene, ‘disciples’ (from laala, ‘teach’, thus ‘people who are
taught’)7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes1357.2.3 Unaccusative (‘Impersonal Passive’)
Although the agent of a verb marked with Passive -tené is seldom stated explicitly, it
appears that its existence is nevertheless always implied. This contrasts with the other
passive-like suﬃx -nca, which is described by Stevenson as ‘Stative or Neuter-Passive’
(Stevenson 1956-57:57). It has no obvious agent and in this sense can be thought of as
an ‘impersonal’ type of passive. Perhaps the most useful term to use to describe this
form is ‘Unaccusative’.
Unaccusatives are deﬁned by Perlmutter, within the framework of Relational Grammar, as containing ‘a 2-arc but no 1-arc’ (Perlmutter 1978:160). That is to say, they
have an underlying direct object (usually the semantic Patient) which is ‘advanced’ to
the position of subject but, unlike passives, have no Agent argument to be ‘demoted’
to an oblique position. Expressing this in more theory-neutral terms, an Unaccusative
verb can be deﬁned as one whose syntactic subject is its Patient/Theme argument and
which has no Agent argument. This is exactly the situation which occurs with the
Katcha -nca suﬃx and so ‘Unaccusative’ would seem to be an appropriate name for
this suﬃx.
The contrast in meaning between Passive and Unaccusative forms can be seen in
(7.21-7.23). Stevenson (1941:113-114) suggests that ‘the general implication’ of a verb
marked with -nca ‘is ﬁnality, or state.’ Clearly, this does not mean that a verb marked
with -nca must carry a stative/generic meaning: whilst this does appear to be the case
for (7.23), examples (7.21-7.22) both refer to single events. Rather, it is a question of
how the event is viewed. In the passive (7.21a/b, 7.22a) the focus is on the event itself,
which is seen as an action and therefore has an implied agent. In the unaccusative
(7.21c, 7.22b) the focus is on the result of the event, which is seen as a process and
therefore has no implied agent. In both the passive and the unaccusative, the syntactic
subject is the semantic undergoer (i.e. the patient) of the event described by the verb.

The Unaccusative is frequently followed by a locative adverb5 , such as kʊ́ɓʊ́, ‘down’
in (7.21c) and (7.22b). This does not appear to be obligatory, and never appears when
there is some other complement of the verb (as in (7.23b)). However, where there is no
complement, it seems to be strongly preferred.
There is a connection between the Unaccusative and the Antipassive, which manifests in two ways. The ﬁrst is morphological. Stevenson states that the Unaccusative
suﬃx is ‘by preference attached to intransitive verbs’ (Stevenson 1941:114). An example
of this is shown in (7.22b). According to my data, the preference is not quite as strong
as Stevenson’s statement suggests; indeed, his own data includes as many verbs with-nca attached to a transitive stem as to an intransitive one. Stevenson’s examples of
verbs where -nca attaches to an Antipassive suﬃx largely concur with mine, suggesting
that this is perhaps a lexical preference. Nonetheless, there appear to be a reasonable
number of these, so it seems fair to say that there is at least some correlation between
these two forms of the verb.
The second way in which Unaccusative and Antipassive are connected is a semantic
one, seen in (7.23b). Like the Antipassive (see example 7.16), the Unaccusative can
be used to describe events with a general scope or of a habitual nature. Thus while
(7.23a) describes a present event, (7.23b) describes a habitual situation.

"5.5.1 Relatives
Given the analysis of já/mɔ́/nɔ́ as a demonstrative pronoun, it might be assumed that
in a relative clause it would play the role of a relative pronoun. From a typological point
of view, this would be distinctly surprising. Cross-linguistically, relative pronouns are
an uncommon way of encoding relativization, and are largely non-existent in Africa.
Of the 166 languages whose subject-relativization strategies are surveyed in WALS
(Comrie and Kuteva 2013a), only 12 make use of relative pronouns. Of those, 11 are
European languages and the twelfth is North American. Furthermore, the majority of
relative pronouns are derived from interrogative morphemes; it is extremely rare for a
demonstrative to be the source of a relative pronoun. This contrasts with the case of
invariant relative complementizers, which often derive from demonstratives (de Vries
2002; Gisborne and Truswell 2016). A demonstrative pronoun acting as a relative
pronoun is therefore not something we would expect to ﬁnd in Katcha.
In fact, there are ways in which the demonstrative head of a relative clause in Katcha
does not act as a classic relative pronoun. The deﬁnition of the ‘relative pronoun
strategy’ used in WALS is that ‘the position relativized is indicated inside the relative
clause by means of a clause-initial pronominal element, and this pronominal element
is case-marked (by case or by an adposition) to indicate the role of the head noun
within the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). This is contrasted with the
‘gap strategy’ where ‘there is no overt case-marked reference to the head noun within
the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). Case-marking is therefore central to
Comrie and Kuteva’s deﬁnition. In section 6.6, it will be suggested that case on Katcha
pronouns may be indicated by tone. Since the tone on the demonstrative morpheme
appears to remain consistently high, this suggests that there is no case marking. So by
this deﬁnition, Katcha uses a ‘gap strategy’ for subject relatives, as would be expected
given its genetic and geographical location. Also, note that non-subject relative clauses
often utilise a resumptive pronoun (section 5.3). The internal syntax of non-subject
relatives is yet to be investigated (pending a study of dependent and non-ﬁnite clauses),
but a couple of implications can be drawn from this fact. Firstly, as with the gap
strategy for subject relatives, a resumptive strategy for non-subject relatives is not
out of place genetically or geographically (Comrie and Kuteva 2013b). Secondly, the5.5. Cross-linguistic connections89presence of a resumptive implies that it is this rather than the demonstrative which
encodes ‘the syntactic-semantic role of the head noun in the relative clause’ (Comrie and
Kuteva 2013c). By these deﬁnitions then, the demonstrative is not a relative pronoun
in the classic sense.
A better characterisation of the role of the demonstrative in Katcha relative clauses
is that it is a ‘relative marker’ (RM) in the sense described by de Vries (2002). Following
Lehman (1984), de Vries argues that there are three possible functions of a relative
element: Subordination, Attribution and Gap Construction (de Vries 2002:155), and
that an RM is a ‘type of relative particle that has just the Attribution function’ (de Vries
2002:170). That is, an RM encodes the fact that the relative clause is attributed to
the head. There are four distinctive characteristics of relative markers, all of which are
true for Katcha (de Vries 2002:174-176):
i) RMs are attested only in post-nominal relative clauses.
ii) RMs occupy the ﬁrst position in the relative clause.
iii) RMs show at least some overt evidence of agreement with the head noun.
iv) RMs are predominantly found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages.
When used in a relative clause, demonstrative já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is a relative marker encoding the function of Attribution, rather than a relative pronoun encoding Gap Construction. Gap Construction is concerned with the role of the relativised element within the
relative clause and is therefore marked by a pronoun (relative or resumptive) whose case
marks its role in the subordinate clause; Attribution is concerned with the relationship
of the relative clause to the head and is therefore ‘indicated by ϕ-feature agreement
with the head – i.e. person, number, gender, class (+ϕ, in short) – and placement at the
sentence border’ (de Vries 2002:157). To put this another way, relative pronouns of the

"9.7 Conclusion
The basic proposal advanced in this chapter is that prepositional phrases should be
treated as adjuncts. A prepositional phrase speciﬁes an additional property of some
expression of the matrix proposition. In other words, it provides a predicate which
takes such an expression as one of its arguments. That expression may be a term (an
individual or event) in the case of an adjectival PP, or a predicate in the case of an
adverbial PP. In Dynamic Syntax terms, prepositions induce structure which is LINKed
to the matrix propositional tree and which shares semantic content with some node in
the matrix tree.
The approach to prepositional phrases proposed here treats adjectival prepositions
somewhat diﬀerently to adverbial prepositions. Adjectival PPs are of type e → t while
adverbial prepositions are of type (e → t) → (e → t). This distinction, of course,
is reﬂective of the semantics. An adjectival PP has an intersective interpretation; it
predicates over some term of the matrix proposition to express an additional proposition
concerning that term. An adverbial PP has a subsective interpretation; it predicates
over some predicate of the matrix proposition to express an additional property of that
predicate. Nonetheless, both are prepositional phrases and it should be expected that
they will behave in largely parallel ways. And in fact they do. Despite the diﬀerent
semantic types, all prepositions project a predicate that expresses some relation between
their complement and the expression that they modify. This relation is not part of
the core structure of the matrix proposition, but rather semantically enriches some
expression within it. This can be modelled quite naturally as a separate structure
connected to the modiﬁed expression by means of a LINK.
The construal of prepositional phrases as LINKed structures, and prepositions as9.7. Conclusion217predicates, explicitly categorises them as modiﬁers. There are therefore substantial
parallels to be seen between prepositional phrases and other modiﬁers. The distinction
between intersective and subsective PPs, for example, parallels the same distinction
seen in the semantics of adjectives. Indeed, Cann (In prep.) suggests an analysis for
English adjectives which directly parallels the one given here: intersective adjectives
induce LINKed structure from the internal variable of an epsilon term (ie. a T y(e)
node), while subsective adjectives induce LINKed structure from the restrictor of an
epsilon term (i.e. a T y(e → t) node). Similarly, the treatment of prepositional phrases
oﬀered here draws explicit parallels between (adjectival) prepositional phrases and
relative clauses. Both prepositional phrases and relative clauses project propositions
which share an argument with the matrix proposition. It is therefore not surprising
that they should use the same basic technical apparatus. The diﬀerence between them
is that relatives include an anaphoric device (either a relative pronoun or a resumptive
pronoun), which introduces the shared argument into their sub-proposition. Like bare
relatives in English, prepositional phrases contain no such anaphoric device so the
shared argument must be introduced by the LINK-COPY Introduction rule.
Sections 9.5 and 9.6 demonstrated that this analysis is also relevant to constructions
other than prepositional phrases, and both applications have potential theoretical
implications. In section 9.5 it was argued that applicatives can be treated in just
the same way as prepositions, a stance which gains support from the fact that in many
languages the two constructions are related by both a semantic equivalence and by
a history of grammaticalization. The diﬀerence between the two constructions is one
of constituency: the complement of a preposition immediately follows it, whereas the
applied object (which is construed as the complement of the applicative morpheme)
does not necessarily follow immediately after the applicative marker. To state that
applicatives and adpositions are essentially equivalent is therefore something of a
challenge to the importance of the notion of constituency, which is central to most
theories of syntax.
It was noted in several places, both in chapter 6 and in the present chapter, that
case markers and adpositions represent two ends of a continuum and that there is
no great diﬀerence between them. However, in discussing the diﬀerences between the
Dynamic Syntax construal of case and the account of adpositions given here, section 9.6
laid out what appears to be a quite clear distinction between them. Case is considered
to be a ﬁlter on well-formed structure, specifying where a particular node may be
situated in a tree, but providing no semantic content. On the other hand, adpositions
induce a LINKed sub-tree, building semantic structure and contributing the Formula
value of its predicate. The account oﬀered here can therefore be argued to draw a
substantive theoretical distinction between case and adpositions; the two are quite
diﬀerent within the DS framework. This apparently goes against the general view that218Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casecase and adpositions are actually very similar. However, ‘similar’ is not the same
as ‘identical’. Payne oﬀers a ‘rule of thumb’ for distinguishing case markers from
adpositions which he suggests ‘probably works 90 percent of the time.’ This is the
notion that case marking is imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
occurs, while adpositions may occur freely. By this deﬁnition, case may be ‘determined
by the grammatical requirements of the verb (or other case-governing element)… Adpositional phrases are usually (though not always) “optional” sentence constituents’
(Payne 1997:100-101). The discussion of case and adpositions in section 9.6 might be
thought of as something close to a DS-theoretic characterisation of this ‘rule of thumb’.
With case, the propositional structure and semantic content is projected by the ‘verb
(or other case-governing element)’; case markers simply decorate this structure with
requirements to ensure the correct interpretation of the noun phrase. Adpositions on
the other hand are ‘ “optional” sentence constituents’ because they construct a tree
structure and decorate it with semantic content; moreover, the structure they project
is an adjunct, a LINKed sub-tree. The two deﬁnitions of the diﬀerence between case
and adpositions have a slightly diﬀerent focus though and so they are not quite the
same. Payne’s ‘rule of thumb’ focuses on the obligatoriness of case compared with
the optionality of adpositional constructions; the Dynamic Syntax account oﬀered here
suggests that the diﬀerence is semantic: case morphemes are semantically null and build
no structure, while adpositions contribute semantic content and also induce semantic
structure. The observation that adpositions tend to be more optional is a reﬂection
of the fact that, as modifying adjuncts, the structure they build is outside the main
propositional tree.
The application of Dynamic Syntax to Katcha prepositional phrases uses only
standard DS rules which have been motivated in other contexts for other constructions
in other languages. Nonetheless, applying these rules to the Katcha data considered
here has implications for our understanding of applicatives and case, as well as for our
understanding of prepositional phrases. The key insight oﬀered here is that prepositional phrases are predicates expressing additional information about some element of
the core proposition of an utterance.","[235, 236, 237]"
"72Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Nominal Modiﬁers5.2.2 Possessive NPs as Pronouns
Possessive noun phrases may occur without the head noun. Thus it is possible to answer
a question such as (5.16a) with the short answer in (b):
(5.16) a. ɲɔrɔɲɔrɔ́ ócóɪ ɪʊŋːɔ́áútú k-asáːsâk.o.spear which 3ms 3ms.exist dat 2s dcm-want
‘Which spear do you want?’
b. jákʊ́kkʊ̂poss.m Kuku
‘Kuku’s one’
As with demonstratives, this suggests that the possessive particle is pronominal in
nature. Again, it might be argued that (5.16b) is an example of ellipsis, but there are
also examples from the Katcha texts of possessives being used in a slightly diﬀerent
pronominal manner:
(5.17) Nahamada nïïlenahamata ni:leposs.p Hamad Nile
‘Those of Hamad Nile (i.e. Hamad Nile’s people/family)’(SPLA:7)Example (5.17) occurs at the beginning of a sentence with no linguistic antecedent
or other obvious candidate for ellided content. It would seem in this case that the
possessive noun phrase is unquestionably pronominal, taking its referent purely from
context.","[90, 91]"

It was demonstrated in section 4.2 that Katcha has three gender classes and that the
semantic number of an unmarked noun is not generally relevant to its gender agreement
properties (other than in the case of male/female animate referents). However, it
has been shown in this section that morphological number is very relevant to gender,
since the number-marking aﬃx on a noun assigns it gender. For nouns which are
morphologically marked for number, gender classiﬁcation is a property of the number
aﬃx and not of the root noun.
Because a noun’s gender is determined by its number-marking aﬃx, this may result
in diﬀering gender between semantically singular and semantically plural forms of the4.4. The third gender as ‘Plural’59same noun. This phenomenon, known as polarity (following Meinhof (1910:135-6)),
is well attested in the Cushitic and Semitic branches of Afroasiatic. Dimmendaal
(1987:172) speculates whether polarity in Krongo may indicate earlier contact between
the Kadu languages and other language families. Whatever the origins, in Katcha
a noun’s gender in the singular may diﬀer from its gender in the plural and this
is determined by the singulative or plurative aﬃx. There is therefore a very clear
interaction between number marking and nominal gender.","[75, 76, 77, 78]"

When the possessor noun begins with a vowel, the vowel of the possessive marker
assimilates to the vowel of the possessor and the possessive marker cliticises to the
possessor noun. This can be most easily seen with pronouns such as eté in (5.11-5.13).

Stevenson (1941:48, 1956-57:62) treats pronominal possessors as possessive pronouns
which take a gender agreement preﬁx. That is, he treats jéːté in (5.11) as a possessive
pronoun éːté with a masculine agreement preﬁx j-, rather than as a possessive morphemejá with a pronoun été, as glossed in (5.11). However, there are reasons to disprefer
Stevenson’s analysis. One is that this form of the pronoun (but without the gender
agreement) is used in many non-possessive contexts, such as dative and locative (see
chapter 6). Also, with respect to the t- preﬁx and to gender agreement, the possessor
phrases in (5.11-5.13) behave in an exactly parallel way to the possessive particle +
noun sequences in (5.10-5.15). These two facts suggest that the ‘possessive pronouns’5.2. Possessive Noun Phrases71should be considered to be possessive particle + pronoun sequences, with the pronoun
in the ordinary oblique case.2
Further evidence that possessive pronouns are in fact possessive particle + pronoun sequences may come from the fact that in much of the existing Katcha written
material (eg. the draft Bible translation) they are written as separate words whent- (marking a peripheral argument) is present, eg. <tiya t >. This is despite the
fact that possessive pronouns are written as single words when they modify a core
argument, eg. <y t >. The latter is reﬂective of the pronunciation, which is identical
in both cases, with the exception of some minor tone perturbation: tɪ ́jú:dú cf ju:dú .
It would seem probable that the single-word spelling is reﬂective of the phonology
while the two-word spelling is reﬂective of the underlying morphology. Where native
speakers naturally put their word breaks should certainly not be considered conclusive
linguistic evidence, but the existence of the two-word spelling, which does not match
the surface phonetics, does lend some additional weight to the argument that there is
a psychologically real morpheme break here.","[88, 89, 90]"
"Theformer generally have a shorter, more neutral vowel, which is often subject to vowel
elision and harmony, both of which are very common general processes in Katcha.
The tone of this vowel appears to be high but these morphemes are frequently run
together with the following word (often eliding the vowel) such that it can be hard
to establish tone accurately. The vowel also has a tendency to harmonise to some
degree with the following vowel. So although generally written as <ya ma na>,
pronunciation may vary according to the vowel that follows (eg. [jɪ ́ mɪ ́ nɪ ]́ or [jɔ́ mɔ́nɔ́]). The vowel harmony is not always as complete as in some other contexts (the vowel
harmony between noun stem and number preﬁx, for example), presumably due to the
word boundary: /má kʊ́kkʊ̂/ does often sound closer to [m ́ gʊ́kʊ̂] than to [mʊ́gʊ́kʊ̂] or[mɔ́gʊ́kʊ̂]. It can be diﬃcult to distinguish the exact vowel quality though, because the
vowel is often very short or, as noted above, elided altogether in the case of a following
vowel. This is in marked contrast with the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morphemes which have slightly
longer, more pronounced vowels. They are much less prone to elision before a vowel
and carry an exceptionally high tone.
Signiﬁcantly, the syntactic distribution of these forms is complementary within the
noun phrase: já/má/ná (possessive marker and clause-initial relative marker) occurs atthe beginning of a nominal modiﬁer; já/mɔ́/nɔ́ (demonstrative and clause-ﬁnal relative
marker) occurs only at the end. There is a strong argument therefore that the phonetic
diﬀerences are to do with phrasal intonation. The já/mɔ́/nɔ́ marker occurs at the end
of the noun phrase; importantly, it generally occurs before a pause. This, combined
with the extra-high tone, serves to give it a notable emphasis. In the case of the
demonstratives, there is naturally something contrastive about their semantics, and it
would seem to be this that is reﬂected in the intonation. Relative clauses are generally
parenthetical; again the intonation seems to reﬂect this with a higher than usual tone on
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker and a pause before continuing with the matrix clause. In
contrast, the já/má/ná marker occurs at the beginning of the modiﬁer and consequently
does not carry the same contrastive or parenthetical intonation. It behaves like most
short non-lexical Katcha words (eg. prepositions): undergoing vowel harmony, elision,
etc.
Evidence that the diﬀerence between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is primarily intona-tional can be seen in example (5.35), where the demonstrative morpheme nɔ́ occurs at
the end of a left-dislocated object noun phrase a tʊ́mːá nɔ́, ‘these words’:5.4. A uniﬁed analysis for nominal modiﬁers
(5.35) atʊ́mːá nɔ́a a n-asáːsa79t-atɪrna áːkátop words dem.p 1sg 1sg-want inf-tell 2pl
‘I want to tell you these words’(TEACH:1.48)In this case, there is no contrastive intonation or pause and the vowel of the demonstrative is elided before the pronoun: [adʊ́mːánáː]. Thus this is an example of demonstrativenɔ́ being realised as n- before a vowel, exactly as the possessive/relative markers ná
would be, apparently due to the intonational properties of its position in the sentence.
Note that (5.35) is not an example of a relative marker: the subject pronoun is in
the wrong case (nominative rather than oblique), the verb is ﬁnite and there is no
corresponding clause-ﬁnal relative marker. All of these indicate that this sentence is
made up of a single main clause (in addition to the fact that there is no other candidate
for a matrix verb in this sentence). The analysis of this noun phrase as a left-dislocated
demonstrative phrase also concurs with the translation provided by Katcha speakers
and the spelling suggested by them (<no> rather than <na>).
Some additional evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are allomorphs comes from
the spelling conventions used in literature written by Katcha speakers (in particular,
the draft Katcha New Testament). When possessive and clause-inital relative markers
(já/má/ná) occur with the oblique argument marker t- they are consistently written as
<tiya tamo tano>3 even when preceding a vowel. When these markers occur without
the t- and precede a vowel, they are consistently written as a preﬁx <y-/m-/n->.
When they occur without the t- but precede a consonant, they are generally written
as <ya/ma/na>. Thus the same morpheme may be spelled three ways according to
context. Signiﬁcantly, spellings with <-o> and spellings with <-a> are both used
in diﬀerent contexts for what is clearly the same morpheme, despite the fact that
this spelling alternation does not reﬂect the phonetic realisation. Spelling habits
should certainly not be taken as conclusive (it may simply be that certain spellings
are becoming conventionalised in the vernacular literature), but they may be extra
evidence that Katcha speakers do not distinguish between these morphemes.

The team also sometimes write <tammo> and <tanno>, but I am not convinced the consonant is
long.","[97, 98]"
"Acomputational action that is motivated by data from only one language might be
suspicious, but it is not clear how many languages would need to be analysed as using
a particular action before it was no longer classed as ‘idiosyncratic’. Besides, it must be
theoretically possible that a rule that is dismissed for being language-idiosyncratic may
be a genuine rule of the computational system, just one that is not widely used. For
this reason I would favour positing a novel computational action over invoking a silent
morpheme, though it should always be done tentatively in the hope of conﬁrmation by
additional data. In fact, the LINK-COPY Introduction rule discussed in section
9.2 is an example of exactly this kind. It was introduced to account for English bare
relatives and was controversial due to seemingly being language-speciﬁc. However, the
fact that it has been used to account for Katcha recursive prepositional phrases – an
unrelated construction in an unrelated language – makes it seem much more likely to
be a universally available rule of grammar.
Ultimately, answering these questions will need more analysis of more data from
diverse languages. Only with enough cross-linguistic data would it be possible to11.3. Concluding comments261develop (something close to) an exhaustive list of computational actions, or to know
whether a given putative action is too idiosyncratic to be kept as a computational rule.
As ever in linguistics, there is a need for more ﬁeldwork, more language data and more
testing of the theory using data from many and diverse languages.
Of course, we do not want to be positing novel computational actions too frequently.
If every language that is investigated turns up three or four extra rules, something
has gone wrong! However, it should be noted that in general the analyses of Katcha
nominals presented in this study have not required new computational actions to be
invoked. The analysis of recursive PPs required the resurrection of LINK-COPY
Introduction and the analysis of relative clauses as headed by demonstrative pronouns required some adjustment to the concept of Substitution, but otherwise, the
analyses in part III were achieved by the application of pre-existing rules to new data.
It is important to note that the way these pre-existing rules apply in Katcha is often
diﬀerent to the way they apply in previously-studied languages. So LINK Apposition,
which has been used for appositive constructions and for equative copular clauses in
English, is used for nominal modiﬁers in Katcha. Likewise, LINK Introduction
rules used for relative clauses in English can be used for prepositional phrases and
applicatives in Katcha. This use of a small number of universal tools to create some
quite diﬀerent linguistic constructions is reﬂective of the variety and creativity found
in human language.","[279, 280]"
"The ﬁrst is that there is nothing to specify possession inthe implementation, which reﬂects the fact that there are no morphemes indicating
possession in the Katcha construction (or indeed, in the parallel English construction
punched me on the nose). Nonetheless, a possessive interpretation is ensured by the
fact that the propositions projected by the two prepositional phrases are construed as
conjuncts which share an argument. In other words, they express properties of the same
event; the event of ants crawling on Musa is identiﬁed with the event of ants crawling on
a body. So for the overall proposition to be semantically and pragmatically coherent,
the body must be Musa’s.
The second observation is that in using the rule of LINK-COPY Introduction
to initiate the construction of sub-trees, some of the burden for introducing semantic9.3. Predicate-modifying prepositional phrases193content into the LINKed tree is moved from the lexicon to the computational system.
This is not a move to be made lightly because Dynamic Syntax takes an explicitly
lexicalist view of grammar: computational actions are in principle general, optional
and universally available across languages; it is to be expected that any idiosyncratic
features of a language will be found in the lexicon.","[211, 212]"
"5.3 Relative Clauses
Relative clauses in Katcha are formed using two relative particles, one at the beginning
of the relative clause and one at the end. The clause-initial relative marker is já/má/ná;
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker is já/mɔ́/nɔ́.",[91]

where a = ιx , (Daisy′ (x) ∧ Want′ (x)(Musa′ ) ∧ Cow′ (x))
In one sense, this result is unremarkable. We should expect that the semantic interpretation of the Katcha sentence should be equivalent to the corresponding English
sentence; anything else would be problematic. Nonetheless, it is a nice result in the
sense that, while the ﬁnal formula value reﬂects the semantic equivalence between the
two languages, the diﬀerent tree structures produced by the parsing process reﬂect the
diﬀering strategies of the two languages. English noun phrases and Katcha noun phrases
are structured somewhat diﬀerently, but the actions and rules used in the parsing
process, such as the construction and evaluation of LINK relations, are standard DS
rules and not language-speciﬁc. Appying them in the normal way to either the Katcha
data or the English data leads to the correct result.","[245, 246]"

predicts the ungrammaticality of *akká mʊnɪtá kʊ́rɪ, because the applicative morpheme
is construed as projecting a (LINKed) requirement which entails parsing some additional lexical items to resolve it. The presence of the applicative morpheme entails
the presence of the benefactive argument. Nonetheless, the account as it stands is too
powerful. The lexical actions of the applicative marker duplicate those of LINK Introduction. Since LINK Introduction is an optional computational rule, there is no
need to also have a lexicalised version, rendering the analysis rather less elegant. More
importantly, it predicts that the benefactive noun phrase could occur grammatically
without the applicative morpheme being present, decorating a ?T y(t) node constructed
by LINK Introduction just like any other event-modifying preposition. Likewise,
this account predicts that any event-modifying preposition could follow the applicative
morpheme. The lexical actions of the applicative morpheme build a LINKed node
and decorate it with a ?T y(t) requirement; this is exactly the context for parsing a
preposition. Thus the current account incorrectly predicts that a sentence like *akkamʊnɪta kʊrɪ ka kʊkkʊ, with both an applicative verb and a locative phrase, should be
grammatical.
The problem with this account is that it ascribes the semantic content (ben ′ ) to
the ‘preposition’, leaving the applicative morpheme to undertake a purely structural
task (and one for which there is a pre-existing computational rule). Yet in prototypical
applicative constructions, the applicative morpheme clearly makes a semantic contri-210Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casebution (many languages have multiple applicative markers with diﬀerent meanings).
Likewise, in prototypical applicatives there is an alternation between semantically (if
not pragmatically) equivalent applicative and adpositional constructions. It should
therefore be expected that an applicative morpheme will in fact build the same semantic
structure as a preposition. A lexical entry for a prototypical applicative morpheme then
might look more like (9.40), which builds a LINK from an event node, but also builds
the LINKed propositional structure, decorating the nodes as appropriate (including a
Formula value for the predicate node), then moves the pointer back to the matrix tree.
These actions build the partial structure indicated in (9.41).

supported by the semantic equivalence that often exists between adpositions and applicatives and also by the fact that from the point of view of grammaticalization, adpositions are one of the primary sources for applicative morphemes (Peterson 2006:125129). Since there is a synchronic and diachronic connection between prepositions and
applicatives, it should not be surprising to ﬁnd that they are analysed in almost the
same way as one another. The major diﬀerence between the two constructions is that
the complement of an adposition is collocated with it in the string forming what would9.6. Case markers211in traditional grammar be termed a syntactic constituent, whereas the complement of
an applicative, the applied object, may be separated from it.
There are then two possible ways of analysing applicatives. The analytic approach
has a slight semantic advantage: it expresses the semantic role of the applied object by
projecting an additional predicate to related the applied object to the main proposition.
In Katcha there is only one possible role, benefactive, but other languages may have
more than one applicative morpheme assigning diﬀerent roles. The analytic analysis
as laid out here also captures the similarity in function between applicatives and
prepositions. The lexical approach has a slight empirical advantage: in Katcha there
are phonological indications that applicative verbs are more likely to be lexicalised than
verbs with other extensions.
It has been mentioned more than once that the Katcha applicative is somewhat
atypical. One of the ways this is true is the presence of the a marker before the
benefactive argument. If we adopt the analytic analysis of applicatives, where the
lexical actions of the applicative are essentially equivalent to those of an adposition,
the implication is that a is not a preposition. Rather its role is presumably simply
to mark which noun phrase is the applied object; in other words, it is a case marker.
Alternatively, if we adopt the lexical analysis, the benefactive argument is an argument
of the verb and so once again a must be a case marker. As noted above, the indirectobject of a ditransitive verb is also marked with a, which also supports the idea that ais a case marker that does not supply any substantive semantic content. A discussion
of case is the focus of the next section.","[227, 228, 229, 230]"
"8.1. Transitive verbs1518.1 Transitive verbs
Dynamic Syntax (DS) (Kempson et al. 2001; Cann et al. 2005) is a representationalist,
monostratal, parsing-based theory of syntax. It is representationalist in that it purports
to represent the semantic content of natural language as structured formulae of a logical
language. It is monostratal in that there is no level of syntactic representation; there
are no syntactic ‘objects’. Rather, syntax is construed as the set of procedures which
determine how such semantic representations are built up. And it is parsing-based in
that these procedures are carried out incrementally as a string is parsed in real time.
This is the sense in which DS is dynamic. As each word or morpheme is parsed it
provides instructions for a transition from one partial semantic structure to another
until a complete logical form is reached.
A completed semantic structure of Dynamic Syntax is a binary tree with nodes
which are decorated with terms of the epsilon calculus and which may be combined
according to the principles of the lambda calculus. Such a tree is built up step-by-step
using a limited number of general principles (computational actions), and instructions
provided by lexical material (lexical actions).
The parse of a simple transitive sentence such as (8.1) begins, like all parses, with the
goal of establishing a proposition. This is represented in (8.2) by the expression ?T y(t)
which decorates the root node of a partial semantic tree, the question mark expressing
a requirement for that node to be decorated by something of semantic type t. T y is a
label for the category Type, whose values may be t (proposition), e (individual), e → t
(predicate), etc. A pointer, represented by ♢, marks the node of the partial semantic
structure currently under development. At this stage this is the only node in the tree.

‘Kuku is beating the drum’
(8.2) Initial parse state
?T y(t), ♢Computational actions in Dynamic Syntax are both conditional, in the sense that
they require certain structural conditions to be met before they may apply, and optional.
One rule which may apply at this point is *Adjunction. This rule allows for the
construction of an argument node (i.e. requiring type e) whose ﬁnal position in the tree
is unknown at the time of construction. That is, it is not known which argument of the
proposition this node will ultimately represent. The underspeciﬁed relation between
the root node and the unﬁxed argument is represented by the dotted line in (8.3). The152Theoretical Analyses: Verb Extensionsnode is also decorated with a requirement that a position be found for it in the tree,
?∃x.T n(x) (where T n is a label for the category Tree Node address).
(8.3) Application of *Adjunction
?T y(t)?T y(e), ?∃x.T n(x), ♢The next stage in the process is to parse the ﬁrst item in the linguistic string,
the proper name kʊ́kkʊ́. As with computational actions, the syntactic contribution
of a lexical item is to provide a set of instructions as to how to further develop the
partial semantic structure. However in the case of a lexical item, this may also include
providing semantic content to one or more nodes in the tree. This set of procedural
instructions is the item’s lexical entry, and is generally represented as a conditional
package (or ‘macro’) of actions, as in (8.4).
(8.4) Lexical actions associated with kʊ́kkʊ́:
IF
?T y(e)
kʊ́kkʊ́ THEN put(F o(Kuku′ ), T y(e))
ELSEabortThe lexical entry in (8.4) is very straightforward. When the string /kʊ́kkʊ́/ is
encountered, the parser checks whether the current node requires to be decorated with
a semantic individual, i.e. whether there is a ?T y(e) requirement on the node. If there
is, then it decorates the node with the semantic content Kuku′ , which is of type e. (F o
is a label for the category Formula, whose value may be any term of the epsilon and
lambda calculi.) If there is not, the parsing process is aborted and the parse fails.
After carrying out the actions prescribed in (8.4), the unﬁxed node is type complete
which means the pointer may return to the node above giving the partial tree in (8.5).

the string has been parsed. It is known that the proposition involves the individual
represented by Kuku′ , but not what role this individual will play.","[169, 170, 171]"
"9.4 Locative adverbs
(9.23) ak-oɗoak-atáɗák-étékɪ ́ʈáimp.pl-come imp.pl-stand.in.line loc-1sg in.front
‘come, line up in front of me’(THIEF:1.10)In chapter 6 it was noted that words such as kɪʈa in (9.23) are best described as locative
adverbs rather than as prepositional phrases headed by ka. It is now possible to expandupon this distinction. A prepositional phrase like kete in (9.1) modiﬁes a term (even
when that term is an event) and might therefore be described as adjectival. On the
other hand, a prepositional phrase like a kʊɓɓʊ in (9.15) modiﬁes a predicate and mighttherefore be described as adverbial. Analysing words such as kɪʈa as locative adverbs
suggests that they should be analysed in the same way as adverbial prepositional
phrases, that is, as type (e → t) → (e → t) predicates. It was also noted in chapter
6 that these adverbs add detail to the location provided by the locative prepositional198Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casephrase; in other words, they modify the prepositional phrase. Since the prepositional
phrase projects a proposition whose predicate is a locative relation, it is straightforward
to analyse the adverb as modifying this predicate.
Under this analysis, the processing of sentence (9.23) will proceed in the following
manner (ignoring the initial verb akoɗo for conciseness). As with all intransitive verbs,ataɗa , ‘stand’, projects a full propositional template, of type e → (es → t) including a
metavariable decorating the logical subject node and a term decorating the event node.
In the case of (9.23), the verb is in an imperative form. The imperative does two things:
ﬁrstly, it speciﬁes the addressee as the logical subject of the proposition; secondly, it
adds extra information marking the fact that the speaker desires the addressee to bring
about the event expressed by the proposition. Exactly how this is achieved formally is
not relevant to the current discussion, so I for now it is simply indicated by a +IMP
imperative marker on the propositional root node and the proposition is otherwise
treated as if it were declarative. I also assume that having parsed akataɗa, the logical
subject is correctly identiﬁed with the addressee (in this case, the group of boys):

can be parsed, decorating a LINKed propositional tree just as in sections 9.1-9.2 above.
The proposition projected by the prepositional phrase speciﬁes that the event to which
it is LINKed (si ) stands in a LOC ′ relation with the speaker (9.25).","[216, 217]"
"These locative words should be considered adverbs rather thanpostpositions. They regularly occur in constructions where they clearly modify verbs
rather than nouns. In such constructions they occur after both the verb they modify
(6.57) and after any objects (6.58).

"154Theoretical Analyses: Verb ExtensionsLike most contemporary syntactic theories, Dynamic Syntax is lexicalist – language
variation resides in the lexicon – and (8.7) shows an example of this. The lexical
actions in (8.6) reﬂect the fact that Katcha is a full pro-drop language by decorating
the argument nodes with metavariables, represented as U and V. Metavariables are
objects which act as placeholders for contentful Formula values. They do not constitute
expressions in the epsilon/lambda calculi and so must be replaced by such an expression,
this is marked formally by the requirement ?∃x.F o(x). In this way, they satisfy a type
requirement but replace it with a formula requirement. The formula requirement does
not have to be fulﬁlled through a linguistic source. One way it may be done is through
Substitution, a pragmatic process in which a suitable referent is chosen from context.
Thus (8.8) is a grammatical sentence. (In non-pro-drop languages the argument nodes
are decorated merely with a type requirement (?T y(e)), meaning that Substitution
is not a possibility and some lexical item is needed to provide the node with a value.)
(8.8) abʊ
3m.beat

After constructing and decorating the propositional template, the lexical actions of
the verb leave the pointer on the external argument node as in (8.7).3 The metavariable
on this node can be resolved by indentifying the unﬁxed node and the external argument
node. This is done by the computational action of Unification, which allows two typeidentical nodes with compatible addresses and content to be brought together. The
unﬁxed node has a deﬁned formula value but an underspeciﬁed tree node address, while
the external argument node has a deﬁned position in the tree but an underspeciﬁed
formula value. Both are type e, so they may be Unified (8.9).

"Gilley’s data, which was collected from Katcha speakers in Khartoum in2006–2007, matches my own quite closely. In section 4.1 below, I therefore present
some representative nouns of each type and mention where my data diverges from
Gilley’s, but for further examples the interested reader may refer to Gilley’s paper.
The gender system is then described in section 4.2. The main focus of this section is
to establish the number of gender classes in Katcha; there are three classes of agreement
in Katcha but previous work has been inconsistent as to whether these represent three
gender values, or only two genders plus plural number agreement. The argument
is made that there are three values of gender. It is demonstrated that these are
semantically based on biological gender and so they are described – temporarily –
as masculine, feminine and neuter.
Having described number marking and gender classiﬁcation, the discussion moves
on to the interaction between these two categories. There are two senses in which
number and gender interact in Katcha. Firstly, there is a relationship between the
number-marking preﬁx and the gender of the noun. This is discussed in section 4.3
where it is shown that (for morphologically number-marked nouns) the aﬃx, rather
than the noun root, assigns gender to the noun. This can result in ‘gender polarity’
where the gender of the noun changes when its number changes. Secondly, there is an
intimate connection between the third gender class and the concept of plurality. This
is discussed in section 4.4. It is argued that rather than neuter, the semantic basis of
the third gender category might be better described as plural.1 The incorporation of
plural as a value of the gender system is a phenomenon that has been described (and
argued about) in the literature on Cushitic, but has to my knowledge never before been
recorded outwith that language family.
The place of this chapter within the study as a whole is largely to provide background information. The focus in this chapter is primarily morphological: to establish
the number and nature of gender classes. An understanding of the gender system,
and to a lesser extent the number system, is foundational to understanding Katcha
nominals. However, it is not the main focus of the descriptive and theoretical analyses
in the rest of the thesis, which focus on syntax and semantics. I assume that phonology
and morphology play a part in establishing the input to syntax, but I am relaxed about

is the more important feature in Katcha.",[55]

The following comments can be made about the consonant phonemes of Katcha,listed in (3.1).
Voicing. Voicing is not phonemic. Voiced and voiceless allophones of plosives and
fricatives occur throughout Katcha with predictable distribution. This is a highly
salient feature of Katcha and also of the other Kadu languages:
For example, plosives and fricatives are voiced between vowels, but are
voiceless at the beginning of words (Dafalla 2006:157).
Explosives become voiced in an environment with an adequate level of
voicing both preceding and following them. This conditioning operates
across word boundaries as well as within words. An environment consisting
of nasals and/or vowels always produces voicing… The voicing of fricatives
is much more variable between speakers, and is generally less pronounced
than for explosives, though occurring most strongly in an environment that
includes a nasal (Hall and Hall 2004:3-4).
Questionable phonemes. Hall and Hall (2004) suggest a possible contrast between
voiced and voiceless palatal plosives [c] and [ ]: ‘In Katcha, Keiga and Miri, the voiceless
palatal plosive, c, contrasts word initially with the voiced form though c has the less
frequent occurrence’ (Hall and Hall 2004:4). This was not a contrast I found during
ﬁeldwork and consequently in this study all palatal plosives are transcribed as <c>.
It should be noted though, that Hall and Hall make this suggestion under the heading
of ‘Infrequently Occurring Consonants’. They also note that ‘in the other [related]
languages c does not occur, and is a phoneme.’ Their suggestion of a possible contrast
also contradicts their later assertion that ‘Katcha does not have phonemic contrast for
voicing between any phonemes’ (Hall and Hall 2005:4). Dafalla and Schadeberg also
assume non-contrast across the board.
Contrastingly, I found Katcha speakers to sometimes claim a contrast between /b/
and /p/ (in addition to /ɓ/). It is diﬃcult to know whether this is truly a phonemic
contrast; having been educated in English, they were aware that <b> and <p> are
‘two diﬀerent letters’. However, this was also true for other voiced/voiceless pairs
such as /t/ and[d], /k/ and [ ], etc. which are clearly non-contrastive. I have therefore
retained <b> in Katcha transcriptions where speakers were insistent, but have generally
assumed the phoneme to be /p/ elsewhere.
Hall and Hall (2004) do not list the glottal stop as a phoneme of Katcha. It does
exist, but is of highly limited distribution, occurring only in the singular forms of the
‘core’ personal pronouns (see chapter 6). This is true throughout the Kadu language
family: ‘The status of the glottal stop is rather special. It occurs in the personal
pronouns in all nine languages, but it is rare or absent elsewhere in the vocabulary’
(Schadeberg 1994:18).","[44, 45]"

7.2.1 Antipassive
A verb suﬃxed with an Antipassive marker corresponds to Stevenson’s “Intransitive
Stem” (Stevenson 1941:110). There are two main Antipassive suﬃxes, the choice of
which appears to be lexically determined by the verb. Probably the more common is-VnV (7.8b-7.11b), while -VkV (7.12b-7.13b) is also attested. In both cases the quality
of the vowel in the suﬃx varies according to the vowel(s) in the verb root. The tone on
the suﬃx also varies but there does not seem to be any clear pattern to this variation.

A possible further example of an antipassive suﬃx is -rɪ as found in akʊ́rɪ ́ ‘eat (intrans)’(7.14b). This appears to be a unique suﬃx: no other examples of an antipassive -rɪ areattested in my data, and Stevenson also states that it it is ‘an unusual form’ (Stevenson
1941:110). In addition, there is no sign of the vowel harmony between suﬃx and root
which appears to exist for -VnV and -VkV. It may therefore be better to think of akʊ́rɪ ́
as a separate intransitive verb (though one clearly related to the transitive akʊ́).(7.14) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ akʊ́mɪ ́teeneKuku 3m.eat asida

This is rather striking in examples such as ‘wake’ (7.10a) and ‘laugh’ (7.11a). It is not
hard to conceive that a language might treat the intransitive ‘wake’ as the less complex
form, rendering the transitive with a causative or similar device. Similarly, it seems
intuitive that in English, intransitive ‘laugh’ is semantically more basic than transitive
‘laugh at’, a fact which is reﬂected in the morphosyntax. This is not the case in Katcha.
Morphologically at least, the transitive is always the simpler form, with the intransitive
being formed by the use of the Antipassive suﬃx.
Semantically, the Antipassive is used where the identity of the semantic theme or
patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. As a (relatively) fully
pro-drop language, a clause in which the patient is known or implied may be expressed
using an ordinary transitive verb. (7.15a) gives an example of a verb whose object,
being implied, is simply ‘dropped’. (For comparison, (7.15b) shows the same verb with
a full complement of overt object arguments.)
(7.15) a. n-aɗáŋŋá êːne
1s-give3p‘I give (it) to them’(THIEF:1.19)b. m-aɗáŋŋá nuk-urúːnú ʊ́ŋŋɔ́
3f-givepl-yeark-áʈábbʊ́1pl.excl 3p-be.many‘she gives many years to us’(TEACH:1.60)Both the transitive and the antipassive forms of the verb, then, may occur with no
overt syntactic object. The key distinction between them is semantic: a transitive verb
with an implied semantic object is expressed using an unmarked transitive form; a
transitive verb with no object (implied or otherwise) is expressed using a verb with an
Antipassive suﬃx.
Stevenson (1956-57:58) states that the Antipassive suﬃx (which he calls ‘Qualitative’) may in fact be used with ‘indeﬁnite objects’, in which case it has a general or
habitual interpretation. He gives one example:
(7.16) bibala iyanaɓɪːɓala ɪja-ana
boyfɔeːfɔ3m.milk-antip cows‘The boy milks cows, (i.e. he cow-milks in general).’(Stevenson 1956-57:58)Although (7.16) has a syntactic object, it seems clear that the sentence does not
refer to an event in which any individual actually undergoes milking, i.e. the semantic
theme/patient has no denotation. To that extent, this construction is still in keeping7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes133with the function of these suﬃxes. It is probably still appropriate to think of the suﬃx
as marking antipassive.27.2.2 Passive (‘Personal Passive’)
The suﬃx -tené marks a verb as passive. The subject agreement marker on the verb
agrees with the syntactic subject, which carries the thematic role of theme/patient:
(7.17) a. akkám-ʊnɪkʊ́rɪwoman 3f-cook food
‘a woman is cooking food’
b. kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́
food 3m.pfv-cook-pass
‘the food is being cooked’
(7.18) a. ómúɗi ́ abʊ́
manámbâ3m.hit drum‘the man is hitting a drum’
b. ambá m-abʊ-t n ́ kátábeːnedrum 3f-hit-pass loc wrestling
‘the drum is being hit for wrestling’
The -tené suﬃx is used where there is an implied agent and as such is described by
Stevenson as a “true passive” (Stevenson 1941:113). He states that ‘it often implies
that someone is implicated in the action, and may have a noun complement’ (Stevenson
1941:113), giving (7.19) as an example which includes an explicit agent introduced by
the dative preposition a or locative preposition ka:
(7.19) bibala abadh napupa thiyeniɓɪɓala abʊ-teneapʊppa tɪ-jaɪːnɪboyor ki
ka3m.hit-pass prep father non.core-3m.poss 3m‘The boy is beaten by his father’(Stevenson 1941:113)However, the presence of a noun phrase taking the role of agent, as in (7.19), does
not agree with my ﬁeldwork ﬁndings. In controlled elicitation sessions, I was unable
to elicit a passive sentence with an explicit agent, nor have I found any clearcut
2
This construction could perhaps be thought of as some kind of object incorporation, but I have no
examples of it in my own data, nor have I investigated compounding more generally.","[147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"
"9.1 Event-modifying prepositional phrases
(9.1) aːfʊ́ ʊ́rʊ́néːné k-etek-ɔːnaants 3m.crawl loc-1sg loc-body
‘ants are crawling on my body’
In a sentence like (9.1), it is not necessarily obvious whether the locative phrase ketekɔːna describes the location of the ants or the location of the event of their crawling. In
other words, this phrase might be thought of as modifying an individual or it might be
thought of as modiﬁying an event. From a formal point of view, this distinction does
not matter a great deal since both individuals and events project type e terms. A phrase
such as on my body can be thought of as supplying an additional proposition which is
‘intersective’ in that it shares an argument with the matrix proposition. Whether the
shared argument is an event term or an individual term does not make much diﬀerence
to the process of building the propositional tree.
In Dynamic Syntax, the formal tool used for modelling the connection between
propositions is the LINK relation. A LINK is the relation that holds between two
semantic trees which share some content. It is generally interpreted as a conjunction of
the values of the LINKed nodes. In the case of event-modifying prepositional phrases,
the LINK will hold between the situation argument of the matrix tree and the root
node of a LINKed tree that expresses an additional proposition about that situation.
This formal apparatus, a proposition LINKed to a term, is standardly used in DS
to model relative clauses. This is hardly surprising, given that a relative clause also
represents an additional proposition about some argument of the matrix proposition.
A PP adjunct modifying an argument is essentially a ‘small’ relative clause. To see how9.1. Event-modifying prepositional phrases183this might work, we can consider the process of parsing the sentence in (9.1), assuming
an interpretation where the prepositional phrase modiﬁes the event (though as noted
above, the implementation works in much the same way for an analysis in which the
PP modiﬁes the subject argument).
The processing of (9.1) begins with the parsing of the sentential subject and verb,
the lexical actions of the verb leaving the pointer on the situation argument node as in
(9.2).1,2

additional lexical material, the pointer would move to the logical subject node to resolve
the metavariable by unification with the unﬁxed node and the tree could compile
to give a fully speciﬁed proposition. But with the pointer at the event argument
node, there is nothing to stop this node being developed further. This can be done
using the computational action of LINK Introduction (Kempson et al. 2001:113;
Cann et al. 2005:88). This rule constructs a LINK relation from a type e node to
an open propositional node (a node with a requirement for type t). It also adds a
modal requirement ?⟨↓∗ ⟩(F o(si ), T y(es )), which requires that somewhere below (i.e. in
the LINKed tree) should be a copy of the node at the head of the LINK (9.3).
1The assumption that the lexical actions of the verb leave the pointer on the situation argument
node is an adjustment to the account given in chapter 8 where it was assumed that the lexical actions
of the verb left the pointer on the logical subject node. This does not aﬀect the analyses given there,
merely adding an additional step of pointer movement from the situation argument node to the logical
subject node.

Cann (In prep.) argues that, like other type e terms, event arguments should be construed as epsilon
terms. In the formulae given in this section the internal structure of terms, including event variables,
is suppressed for notational clarity. The interpretation of PP adjuncts given here is a non-restrictive
one and so does not need to make reference to the internal structure of the epsilon-term.","[201, 202]"

The tree given in (9.7) represents the logical form of the sentence aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne kete,
‘ants are crawling on me’. But the sentence in (9.1) speciﬁes the location of the event
further, ‘ants are crawling on my body’. Katcha expresses this by means of a second
locative phrase following the ﬁrst. A parallel construction is found in English (the
assailant punched me on the nose) though in English this only occurs following direct
objects and not with prepositional phrases (*the assailant landed a punch on me on
the nose).
Modelling the recursive construction found in Katcha is in principle quite straightforward; it is simply a case of moving the pointer to the event argument of the LINKed
tree and applying LINK Introduction again to construct another sub-tree. The act
of moving the pointer, though, requires some motivation. As the analysis currently
stands, the lexical actions of locative ka construct a fully decorated external argument
node and there is therefore no reason for the pointer to return to this node once it
has been built, which prevents its further development. There are two alternative
approaches to overcoming this apparent problem. The ﬁrst is a lexical approach. In
section 6.4.2 it was noted that when the pronoun occurs before a body-part locative
phrase its tone melody appears to diﬀer from the usual pronominal tone pattern.
Further research would need to be conducted on the tone system of Katcha before
making categorical assertions, but if this tone change proves to be consistent, it is
certainly possible that it signals the fact that the locative relation is to be further
speciﬁed. Thus a ﬁrst person pronoun with the usual tone melody (H-H after locative188Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseka) would have the lexical entry shown in (9.8a), which decorates a term-requiring node
with a metavariable in the normal way. A ﬁrst person pronoun with the alternative
tone pattern (L-L) would have the lexical entry shown in (9.8b). As well as decorating
the internal argument node with a metavariable, these actions move the pointer to the
external argument node (which is an event variable) and decorate it with a requirement
for a LINK relation to a further proposition.

go(⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↓0 ⟩), put(?⟨L⟩?T y(t))ELSEAbortAnother step of LINK Introduction can now apply in the usual way and the parse
of the next locative phrase can continue as in the same way as the ﬁrst. The function
of the extra requirement on the event node is to force this otherwise optional action to
take place. The alternative tone pattern signals that the proposition is not complete
after the pronoun has been parsed and that it requires further speciﬁcation.
The second approach to overcoming the apparent problem of pointer movement
within the LINKed locative propostion, one that does not rely on tonal information, is
a computational one. This involves making an adjustment to the lexical entry for the
preposition such that it decorates its external argument node with a requirement rather
than formula value (9.10) and a concomitant adjustment to the LINK Introduction
rule such that it copies the formula from the head of the LINK to the new sub-tree as
an annotation on an unﬁxed node, rather than as a requirement (9.9). This version
of LINK Introduction, referred to as LINK-COPY Introduction in Kempson
et al. (2001:117), is exactly what is used for bare relative clauses in English (eg the
man Sue likes). In making this move we are altering the roles of the lexical entry
and the computational action slightly. Rather than the computational rule introducing
a requirement and the lexical entry introducing a decorated node, the lexical entry
introduces a requirement and the computational rule introduces an (unﬁxed) decorated
node.","[205, 206, 207]"
"8.2 Antipassive
(8.16) kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪ ́kɪ ́cé-éné
Kuku laugh.at-antip
‘Kuku is laughing’
As noted in section 7.2.1, the antipassive indicates that the identity of the semantic
theme/patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. However, as
also noted there, the basic form of Katcha verbs is transitive; to analyse a verb like
ɪ ́kɪ ́céen
́ é as a simple one-place predicate would seem to go against the general pattern
of Katcha verbs.
The central insight in the analysis of a sentence like (8.16) therefore is that the
antipassive provides the semantic object for the verb and that this object is indeﬁnite,
arbitrary and completely dependent on the immediate context of the predicate and
its co-arguments in the given situation. In other words, the interpretation of (8.16)
is something like ‘Kuku is laughing (at whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in
this instance)’. Such an analysis is proposed within CCG by Steedman (2011) for
detransitivised verbs in English (such as ‘John is reading’), using dependent Skolem
terms to represent the indeﬁnite object. The Dynamic Syntax formalism, with its use
of the epsilon calculus to represent noun phrases, is well-suited to this type of analysis.
Furthermore, it is common within Dynamic Syntax to assume that propositions include
an additional argument which stands for the situation of evaluation (Gregoromichelaki
2006, 2011; Cann 2011). This situation argument is assumed to be of type es , that is
a subtype of type e. Cann (2011) argues that the semantic content of the situation
argument, like all other arguments of a proposition, should be modelled as an epsilon
term.5 For ease of exposition I ignore the internal content of the situation argument,
simply representing its formula value as an indexed variable, si . Where appropriate I
add informal restrictions, such as si,event(i) or si,state(i) . Incorporating this situation
argument into our account allows us to express the context-dependent nature of the
‘missing’ object quite naturally.
5This allows features such as tense to be construed as a restrictor on the temporal relation between
the event and the time of utterance or other reference point.",[176]

The propositional tree can now be evaluated, leading to the root node being decorated with the propositional formula in (8.47). This represents a proposition that a
shattered b where a is some arbitrary shatterer of stones and b is some arbitrary thing
shattered by a.
Shatter′ (b)(a)(8.47)
wherea = ϵy , Shatter′ (ϵx , Stones′ (x))(y)
b = ϵz , Shatter′ (z)(a))(8.47) represents a proposition that a shattered b where a is any arbitrary stone
shatterer and b is any arbitrary shatteree. In other words, this represents an event of
shattering where neither the agent nor the patient are speciﬁed. This is exactly what
might be expected from a verb carrying both antipassive and unaccusative morphology,
but it does not appear to capture the fact that it was stones which shattered in the
situation being described. In fact, this is only an apparent problem. Epsilon terms
carry inherent existential force, meaning that the situation described in (8.47) involves
not only a shatterer and a shatteree, but also stones. This is most clearly seen when the
formula in (8.47) is translated into a formula of standard predicate logic. Algorithmic8.5. Middle Voice177rules for this conversion (‘Q-Evaluation Rules’) are deﬁned in Kempson et al. (2001:241243). Applying them to (8.47) results in (8.48).
(8.48) ∃x∃y∃z[Stones′ (x) ∧ Shatter′ (x)(y) ∧ Shatter′ (z)(y) ∧ Shatter′ (z)(y)]
The proposition in (8.48) is true just in case there are stones which shattered, while
the agent of the shattering is unspeciﬁed. From a truth conditional point of view, this
interpretation is exactly the same as the interpretation of the unaccusative. Given the
similarities between the middle voice and the unaccusative noted in table 8.1 and in
section 7.2.4, this is a welcome result. It is notable that the treating the verb as having
both an unaccusative and an antipassive morpheme still results in an unaccusative
interpretation. As may be clear from the derivation just outlined, this is because the
unaccusative suﬃx precedes the antipassive and is processed ﬁrst. It is therefore the
unaccusative which determines the tree position of the term projected by the sentential
subject (step (8.43) above). The incremental nature of the parsing process is therefore
crucial in providing the correct interpretation.11
The Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as having internal complexity is also key
to this explanation. The unaccusative suﬃx expresses the external argument of the
predicate (some arbitrary shatterer), while the antipassive suﬃx expresses the internal
argument of the predicate (some arbitrary shatteree). If the terms projected by these
morphemes did not have internal structure, there would be no room for a lexical argument in addition (i.e. the syntactic subject stones). But because terms are construed
as epsilon terms, it is possible for the term ϵx , Stones′ (x) to be incorporated into the
term projected by the unaccusative morpheme, and ultimately to surface in the ﬁnal
propositional formula as ∃x[Stones′ (x)]. The internal structure of arguments essentially
allows the three argument-projecting morphemes to instantiate two argument roles, and
to do so quite naturally.
The truth conditional interpretation of (8.48) is entirely expressed by the ﬁrst two
conjuncts. The third and fourth conjuncts are superﬂuous from a semantic point of
view. But as noted above, Stevenson (1941:112) claims that the antipassive suﬃxes
‘sometimes intensify the meaning of the parent verb.’ Stevenson’s presentation of the
data on this matter is somewhat opaque and not entirely convincing. Nevertheless, it
is notable that adding the antipassive suﬃx to an unaccusative verb causes the ﬁnal
11
In section 7.2.5 it was noted that for some verbs, the unaccusative suﬃx appears to attach to the
antipassive, rather than to the transitive verb stem (7.22b). This causes a problem for the current
analysis. Parsing the two morphemes in order would result in the inverse of the analysis just described
for middle voice; such verbs would be expected to have an antipassive interpretation. In fact, their
interpretation is unaccusative with the apparent antipassive morpheme seeming to make no semantic
contribution. It is not clear how these data might be integrated into the analysis as it currently stands,
other than it was noted in section 7.2.5 that there is some evidence that verbs with the antipassive are
(or may be becoming) more lexicalised than other VE forms. It may be that some of these ‘antipassive’
verbs are better treated as genuinely intransitive verbs.","[194, 195, 196]"
"98Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and PrepositionsWith a couple of exceptions, noted in section 6.5, there is no indication that the
occurrence of these prepositions is necessitated by the verb.
Prepositions in Katcha can be divided into three types according to the form
of pronoun they take as a complement. There are prepositions which require their
(pronominal) complement to be a Core pronoun, and there are prepositions which
require their complement to be an Oblique pronoun. A third paradigm displays a
mixed system, taking Core pronouns in the case of 1st and 2nd person complements,
but Oblique pronouns in the case of 3rd person. (Of course, all prepositions may take
nominal, as well as pronominal, complements.)6.2.1 Prepositions requiring core pronouns
Instrumental
The preposition ana most commonly has an instrumental interpretation (‘with’, ‘by’,
‘by means of’, etc.) as in (6.4).
(6.4) akkámɔ́m-ʊnɪéːmáakʊ́ɓɓʊ́ tɪ ́-jáwoman dem.f 3f-make things instr spoon non.core-dem.3m
‘The woman is making food using this spoon’
As can be seen in (6.4), before a consonant the instrumental preposition is realised
as /a/. Before a vowel it is realised as /an/. It is therefore seldom, if ever, acutally
realised as /ana/ in natural speech. Nonetheless, this is the form given when the word
is elicited in isolation and Katcha writers are consistent in spelling it this way, at least
before vowels (before consonants they tend to write it as <a>).
A clear example of the alternation between /a/ before a consonant and /an/ before
a vowel is given in (6.5-6.6). These sentences are synonymous, though it should be
noted that áːrabi ́ja is borrowed from Arabic. A pair of examples using indigenous
Katcha vocabulary is therefore given in (6.7) and the semantically somewhat unlikely
(6.8).
(6.5) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne ateremɓéːleKuku 3m.move instr car
‘Kuku is going by car’
(6.6) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne anáːrabi ́jaKuku 3m.move instr car

‘Kuku is going by horse’
(6.8) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne anúŋkuKuku 3m.move instr leopard
‘Kuku is going by leopard’
The instrumental preposition tends to mark a less active or subordinate participant.
Thus in (6.9) (where the complement of ana is a human) the sentence implies that
Kuku, the sentential subject, is showing the way. If the intended interpretation was
one of joint action (‘Kuku is going with me’ i.e. we are going together) the appropriate
preposition would be accompaniment nca (see section 6.2.3).
(6.9) kʊ́kkʊ́ ʊ́ŋkéːne anaa áKuku 3m.move instr 1sg
‘Kuku is going with me’ (He is showing me the way)
Similarly, when used in conjunction with the verb öꞌdö ‘come’, ana gives the meaning
‘bring’ (6.10-6.11):
(6.10) kïkkïrï kööꞌdök-ikkiri k-o-oɗoakisine njaakɪsɪne ncaꞌbiiꞌbala miini

section 6.2.3), but the occurence of ana aꞌa in the second clause shows this to be anexample of the instrumental.","[116, 117, 118]"

with the prepositional phrase in (9.4). Firstly, prepositional phrases are phrases and
not clauses; they are not tensed and do not have truth values and so cannot constitute
well-formed propositions on their own. This is reﬂected in the fact that the lexical
actions associated with the prepositional phrase can only be processed in the context
of a LINK transition from a superordinate semantic tree. Nonetheless, the LINKed
tree is an expression of type t, a proposition, in that it expresses a relation between
two terms, and in the case of (9.4) one of them is an event argument. A prepositional
phrase thus constitutes a kind of dependent proposition. Secondly, the lexical actions
associated with the preposition do not supply an event argument. Instead, they ka
copy the formula value from the head of the LINK transition to the logical subject
node of the subordinate tree. In (9.4), this shared term happens to be an event.3
Up to this point, the parser has processed aːfʊ ʊrʊneːne kete. This is a grammatical
sentence, ‘ants are crawling on me’, which is reﬂected in the fact that the semantic
structure so far constructed is made up of two well formed propositional structures
(one a LINKed sub-tree of the other). If there were no more lexical material to be
parsed in (9.1), the pointer would return to the matrix tree, the metavariable U on
the matrix logical subject node would be uniﬁed with the unﬁxed node and a step of
LINK-Evaluation would apply leading to the ﬁnal tree in (9.7) which represents the
conjoined proposition that ants crawl in event si and that the location of this event is
Musa.
3
As it stands, there is nothing in the lexical entry (9.4) to prevent the locative phrase modifying an
individual, should the interpretation be that the ants are on me, rather than the ants’ crawling is on

of making the LINKed proposition non-ﬁnite, but given that a preposition cannot project a matrix
clause, this should cause no problem.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"

disjunct from the lexical entry in (10.26)) will be executed, constructing the ‘possessive’
predicate as well as the iota-structure as its object. Thus far the process is exactly as
for possessives, leading to the partial tree in (10.32).

with ka. For now it is suﬃcient to see how straightforwardly non-subject relatives may
be integrated into the overall analysis of nominal modiﬁers.1010.5 Conclusion
The analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers proposed in chapter 5 is that they are
uniformly ‘headed’ by demonstrative pronouns appositional to the noun phrase. This
is modelled in the Dynamic Syntax framework using a general computational rule
of Appositive LINK Introduction (10.4). This rule constructs a LINK relation
between two type e nodes which are decorated by epsilon terms projected by two noun
phrases, namely the modiﬁed NP (a lexical noun) and the modiﬁer ‘headed’ by a
demonstrative pronoun. The corresponding evaluation rule (10.9) merges the two into
a single epsilon term with a conjoined restrictor. Thus the properties projected by two
noun phrases in apposition can only be interpreted as holding of a single individual.
The analysis of demonstrative pronouns presented here extends the actions associated with them to include the construction of more semantic structure than is
standard in Dynamic Syntax. Pronouns are seen not only to be placeholders but also
to build partial epsilon structures. Speciﬁcally, they project an argument variable and
an epsilon binder, but no restrictor. The restrictor may be provided by substitution
of a referent from context, in which case the demonstrative has a deﬁnite, pronominal
interpretation (section 10.1). Alternatively, it may be provided by a verb, in which
case the demonstrative essentially acts as a relative pronoun (section 10.2). Another
possibility is that the restrictor’s value is constructed from some contextually provided
value expressing some relationship, such as possession, between the argument variable
and some other term (section 10.3). These possibilities directly model the analysis of
chapter 5 where it was argued that the interpretation of a demonstrative pronoun is
dependent on what follows in the rest of the modiﬁer phrase.
The fact that the demonstrative pronoun projects an internal argument node and
decorates it with a variable restricts how the metavariable can be updated by substitution and means that the analysis predicts certain correlations which do not necesarily
seem to be related at ﬁrst. For example, the analysis predicts correctly that only
subjects can be relativised directly. Similarly, the predicate of possession is forced to
have as its logical subject the possessee rather than the possessor, which reﬂects the
10An alternative approach would be to assume that the relative clause provides context to enrich
some semantically weak predicate (possibly a metavariable) which holds of the head noun. In this
case the dependent clause marker presumably marks the fact that the verb does not predicate over
the nominal variable but has some other relation to it. Again, a full analysis will need to wait until
the DCM has been studied more carefully. If this were the correct analysis, it would be likely to have
implications for the present account of the semantically weak predicate P OSSD.","[266, 267, 268]"
"8.1. Transitive verbs153The next item to be parsed is the verb abʊ. The lexical entries of verbs are generally
more complicated than those of proper nouns, providing both the semantic content of
the predicate and a template of the proposition’s argument structure. A lexical entry
for abʊ is given in (8.6).2 When the string /abʊ/ is encountered, the parser checks
whether the node currently under development is a propositional node, i.e. whether
there is a ?T y(t) requirement on the node. If so, it constructs and decorates a partial
tree according to the steps listed in (8.6) where ⟨↓1 ⟩ indicates a functor daughter and
⟨↓0 ⟩ indicates an argument daughter. For example, the ﬁrst line of this set of actions
constructs a functor daughter below the node where the pointer is currently located,
then moves the pointer to that node and decorates it with a requirement for a formula of
type e → t (i.e. a one-place predicate). The second and third lines then build a further
functor daughter node and decorate it with the semantic content λx.λy.Beat′ (x)(y), (a
type e → (e → t) predicate), and so on.

The unity of these categories can also be seen in nominal modiﬁers, such as relative
clauses. In (4.35a) the morphemes which mark the relative clause are ná…nɔ́, agreeingwith the ‘neuter’ noun kanʈá; in (4.35b) the same relative markers are used in agreement
with the plural noun phrase jakʊːb nca juhana.

agreeing with the ‘neuter’ noun kanʈá; in (4.36b) the verb also carries the subjectagreement marker /k/, agreeing with the plural subject katalaːtene.

(4.34–4.36) cannot easily be dismissed as mere homophony. It was shown in section
4.2 that the gender class a noun belongs to is not a reﬂection of its semantic number.
Semantically plural nouns may trigger any of the three agreement patterns, as may
semantically singular nouns. To suggest that many, but not all, plural nouns require
agreement with their number rather than their gender signiﬁcantly complicates the
picture, and causes a suspicious duplication of classes. As summarised in Table 4.2,4.4. The third gender as ‘Plural’61there would be semantically singular nouns taking Masculine, Feminine and Neuter
agreements, there would be semantically plural nouns taking Masculine and Feminine
agreements and there would be semantically plural nouns triggering number agreement
instead of gender agreement. There might also be semantically plural nouns which take
Neuter agreement, but since these would be homophonous with the semantically plural
nouns taking plural number agreement, there would be no way to know. Moreover,
there is no evidence that semantically plural nouns which require gender (ie. Masculine
or Feminine) agreement should be treated as special cases.
Masculine Feminine
Semantically Singular
Semantically Pluraljj-mm-NeuterPluraln?n-Table 4.2: A possible distribution of attributive agreement markers
Assuming that the agreement in examples (4.34b–4.36b) is agreement with plural
number therefore leads to an analysis that is unnecessarily complex. A more straightforward analysis is obtained by assuming that the third class of agreement is always
gender agreement. This means that there are three genders in Katcha. To a large
extent, number is irrelevant: nouns may belong to any of the three gender classes,
regardless of semantic number. However, there is a special relationship between the
third gender and plural number. Co-ordinate referents, as in (4.34b–4.35b), take third
gender agreement, as do semantically plural referents where there is no conﬂicting
linguistic antecedent, as discussed in regard to (4.37) below. This is an important fact
which is missed if we think of the third gender as ‘Neuter’. It more closely captures
the agreement facts to consider this third gender as Plural, as long as it is understood
that this is a grammaticalised version of Plural, not necessarily correlating to semantic
number.
GenderMasculineFemininePluralj-m-n-Table 4.3: Attributive agreement markers in Katcha
The incorporation of Plural into the gender system may cause mismatches between
the syntactic gender of a lexeme and its semantic number, leading to some variation in
agreement behaviour. In (4.37), for example, laːlá, ‘boys’ is Masculine gender, but has
plural semantic number. Both masculine and plural agreement are attested.","[78, 79, 80]"

et al. (2001) describe it as a semantically relatively weak predicate, a ‘relation whose
value is constructed from some contextually provided value’ (Kempson et al. 2001:145).
The case they consider is the English genitive and so they consider the predicate to be
a binary relation with the possessor as its logical subject and the possessee as its logical
object. For simplicity, they represent the predicate as P OSS. In the Katcha case, the
logical subject of this possession relation is the variable representing the possessee which10.3. Possessive NPs245is projected by the demonstrative pronoun. The relation is therefore the inverse of that
suggested by Kempson et al. (2001), and for convenience is written here as P OSSD to
make the diﬀerence explicit. (It can be thought of as ‘x is possessed by y’.) At ﬁrst this
seems like a slightly clumsy approach — hypothesising an implict predicate which may
be construed one way in one language but exactly inversely in another — but there
are two points to be made in its defence. One is that if the value of the predicate is
contextually provided, it might well be expected to vary from language to language.
The second point is that this diﬀerence is not unmotivated, but in fact reﬂects the
morphology of the two languages rather neatly. English possessives are constructed
using a dependent-marking strategy, that is, with morphological marking (‘genitive
case’) on the modifying noun (the possessor). Contrastingly, Katcha possessives are
head-marking8 and are expressed using something much closer to a construct state,
as was noted in section 5.5.2. The Katcha ‘possessive marker’, ie. the demonstrative
pronoun, does not morphologically mark the head noun (the possessee), but it is
associated with it by agreement and anaphorically. So the apparent diﬀerence between
the two languages in the semantics of the possession predicate may in fact be exactly
what we should expect to see, given their contrasting marking strategies for possessives.
If so, far from being clumsy, this is a very nice result. The analysis of the demonstrative
pronoun given in section 10.2 is that it shares an argument variable with the noun it
modiﬁes. This analysis was motivated by the need to account for relative clauses. But
a side eﬀect of that analysis is that in the case of possessives the logical subject of the
possession predicate must be the shared variable, forcing the possession predicate to
be P OSSD rather than P OSS. This directly reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions, because Katcha uses (something close to) a head-marking construct
strategy rather than a dependant-marking genitive strategy.9
8Or at least, ‘head-aligned’, through agreement relations.
Although positing two alternative possession predicates reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions quite neatly, it is not obvious that such a distinction should exist in the semantics.
Assuming that the genitive construction in English and the possessive construction in Katcha express
the same semantic relation, it should perhaps be expected that there would be only one ‘P OSS-type’
relation. If so, the analysis given here forces this predicate to be expressed as the Katcha version with
the head, the possessee, as the external argument, rather than the inverse. Kempson et al. (2001)
make no strong claims for their assumed P OSS relation, describing it only as a relation whose value
is contextually provided, holding between the possessor and the possessee. Likewise, I do not wish to
make any strong claims about this predicate other than to suggest that if there is indeed only one such
relation, it is better to think of it as a property of the head noun, i.e. some relation holding between
the head noun and some modiﬁer.

Non-subject relatives are formed in the same way as subject relatives, the subordinate clause being introduced by a demonstrative pronoun and also being concluded
with one (probably to mark deﬁniteness). However, the internal structure of the relative
clause is diﬀerent – a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked with a dependent clause
marker (and sometimes an inﬁnitive). A resumptive pronoun marking the relativised
element is also common; this does not occur in the case of subject relatives.
A fully worked-out analysis of the internal structure of non-subject relative clauses
will be dependent on an analysis of the dependent clause marker ka and the discourse
properties of non-ﬁnite clauses, which is outwith the scope of the current study. However, it is possible to note a few points about how non-subject relative clauses may ﬁt
into the overall account of nominal modiﬁers.
On the basis of the analysis presented so far, it is obvious why non-subject positions
cannot be relativised. The lexical actions of the demonstrative pronoun, as deﬁned in
(10.17), construct the partial epsilon tree in (10.18), repeated here as (10.30).

The lexical actions projected by the passive morphology therefore serve to ensure that
the pointer is left on the logical object node. The subject can then be processed in the
usual way, which means it will decorate the internal argument node.
There are two strategies that could be used to encode this.

"146Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb Extensionsnominals while (c-d) primarily aﬀect verbs. Katcha verb extensions are all of the
former type, licensing the presence or absence of arguments.
There are various morphemes related to argument structure which are potential
candidates for being classed as verb extensions. Of these, reﬂexives and reciprocals are
not encoded using verb extensions; Katcha uses a more analytic construction with a
noun or pronoun expressing the reﬂexive or reciprocal object.
The applicative is the only one of the Katcha verb extensions to increase valency.
This makes it something of a special case. However, it is also something of a special
case in that it is not typical of applicative constructions typologically. There is no alternative non-applicative construction with the same truth-conditional meaning. Also,
the additional argument it licenses is marked with the dative preposition a rather than
being a direct object, so in one sense this morpheme does not increase valency. Rather,
it introduces an oblique argument and so acts somewhat like a preposition. A Dynamic
Syntax theoretical analysis modelling applicatives from this point of view is given in
chapter 9.
If the ‘applicative’ does not in fact increase valency, then we can revise the statement
at the beginning of this section to say that all Katcha verb extensions decrease valency;
the function of all of them is to license the absence of a syntactic argument. This is
not surprising given that it was noted in section 7.2 that Katcha verbs are inherently
transitive. If it is semantically plausible for a verb to be transitive, this is always
the basic form. Most of these VEs decrease semantic valency in addition to syntactic
valency, presenting the event described by the verb as having only one participant
(though this is not the case for the passive). As shown in table 7.1, Katcha has a
complete paradigm of valency decreasing verb extensions. A theoretical analysis within
the framework of Dynamic Syntax is given for these verb extensions in chapter 8. This
range of VEs allows Katcha to use inherently transitive verbs to present an event as
involving either one or two participants, and to take either the semantic agent or the
semantic patient as subject, thereby providing alternative perspectives on the situation
expressed.","[164, 165]"

Morphosyntactic Descriptions33Chapter 4Number and Gender
Introduction
Katcha has an interaction between the categories of Number and Gender which is typologically unusual. It is also relevant to the wider debate about the genetic aﬃliation of
the Kadu family because the number and gender systems display properties reminiscent
of both Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages. The interaction between number
and gender also shows properties which are very rare, but which have been argued
to exist in certain Afro-Asiatic languages. This is something of a surprise; with the
partial exception of Blench (2006), no previous research has suggested a relationship
between Kadu and the Afro-Asiatic phylum. Whilst typological similarities alone do
not constitute deﬁnitive proof that a language belongs to a particular phylum, they
certainly should be considered seriously. The existence of shared typological phenomena
in two languages may be evidence of a diachronic connection (Bickel 2007, 2011). In
any case, it is notable that the phenomena described in this chapter reﬂect the general
state of confusion over the lineage of Katcha. Given the complexity of the data, it is
not surprising that diﬀerent researchers have interpreted them diﬀerently. There is a
general correlation between the way the morphosyntactic facts have been interpreted
and the assumptions about the language’s genetic aﬃliation prevalent at the time.
Thus, following Greenberg’s (1950) classiﬁcation of the Kadu languages as Kordofanian,
older studies of Katcha (Stevenson 1956-57; Tucker and Bryan 1966) attempted to
demonstrate Niger-Congo-style semantically based noun classes based on the number
preﬁxes. Following Schadeberg’s (1981) questioning of this assumption, more recent
work (Dimmendaal 2000; Gilley 2013) has sought to demonstrate that Katcha displays
a tripartite system more typical of Nilo-Saharan. This chapter will demonstrate that
there are elements of both of these systems present in the Katcha number system,
before going on to demonstrate that certain features of the gender system, such as the
notion of ‘polarity’ and its interaction with number, are more similar to those found in3536Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and GenderAfro-Asiatic.
The chapter begins with a discussion of number marking in section 4.1. Number
is marked on Katcha nouns by a variety of plurative and singulative aﬃxes. A very
welcome recent development in this area has been the publication of Leoma Gilley’s
paper on noun morphology in Katcha (Gilley 2013). This is a comprehensive and
systematic presentation of data on Katcha nouns, focusing on the number-marking
aﬃxes.","[51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"
"2.4. Fieldwork and other data sources212.4 Fieldwork and other data sources
The current study is based on data from the sources discussed above, but also original
data collected through ﬁeldwork in Khartoum between November 2012 and May 2013.
During this time I worked with two members of the Katcha community in Khartoum.
Both were male, aged in their forties and speakers of the Tuna dialect of Katcha. Both
men were born and grew up in the language area, speaking Katcha as their mother
tongue and in most childhood contexts, though being educated in Arabic from the age
of eight. However both had moved to Khartoum at relatively young ages and had lived
in Khartoum for many years (24 years in one case, 36 years in the other). Within
Khartoum both are active within the expatriate Katcha community and continue to
speak Katcha at home and socially. One of the men works as a mechanic and therefore
speaks Arabic at work, but the other is employed as a mother tongue literacy worker
within the Katcha community and therefore teaches, reads and writes Katcha as well
as speaking it most of the time. In addition to Katcha, both men are ﬂuent in Sudanese
Arabic and have a reasonable level of English.
My contact with Katcha speakers was largely limited to formal language sessions
with my two main contacts. The community were wary of foreigners coming to their
neighbourhood due to security concerns, so language sessions were conducted at my
house and I did not get much contact with the wider community. Once a week, I sat in
on a translation checking session with the Katcha Bible translation team (a further two
native speakers) and a translation consultant, though those sessions were conducted in
English.
Language sessions, which happened once or twice per week, were a mixture of controlled elicitation and text elicitation. In order to make the most of potentially limited
ﬁeldwork time, my controlled elicitation concentrated on morphosyntactic features of
the language, eg. agreement paradigms, rather than collecting vocabulary.
The data presented in this study is representative of the morphosyntactic data
collected during ﬁeldwork. Audio recordings were made of the majority of it. A list
of about 130 nouns in both singular and plural forms was also collected. In addition,
three oral texts were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Fieldworks Language
Explorer (FLEx) to create a small database of lexical and functional morphemes.
A further resource is the text of the draft Katcha New Testament. The translation
group have kindly granted me online reader access to their unpublished draft. The
draft is currently under revision, which means it has a tendency to change, and it is
translated material so may not necessarily always be in traditional Katcha cultural or
literary style, but it nonetheless represents a substantial corpus of textual data and
has proven a very helpful source of syntactic examples. An associated resource is the
list of verbs found in the text which is maintined by the translation consultant. This22Preliminaries: Backgroundcurrently lists approximately 470 verbs.
It should be noted that of these various sources of Katcha data, the vast majority
are written only. In particular the two largest sources, Stevenson’s (1941) grammar and
the draft Katcha New Testament are written with no tone and with some inconsistency
with regard to the balance between phonetic detail and morphophonemic consistency.
(More details are given on these matters in chapter 3.) Throughout this thesis I have
therefore tried to use my own data where possible and use examples from the Bible or
Stevenson’s data only sparingly, or to provide extra discussion for speciﬁc hypotheses.","[39, 40, 41]"
"5.6 Conclusion
There are, phonetically, ﬁve sets of morphemes marking nominal modiﬁers in Katcha,
namely j-/m-/n-, já/má/ná, já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû. These serve various
functions, marking proximal, medial and distal demonstratives, possessives, subject
relative clauses and non-subject relative clauses. As implied by table 5.2, the correlation
between the surface phonetic form of the morpheme and its syntactic function is
not completely clear. To reduce this mix of forms and functions to something more
systematic is obviously desirable from the point of view of analytical elegance. However,
it is also desirable for data-driven reasons: with the exception of the medial and
distal demonstrative pronouns, there is considerable uniformity in the form of nominal
modiﬁers and an understanding of how they are related would shed considerable light
on the workings of the language.
With regard to the similarities of form, it was argued in section 5.4.1 that there
is in fact only one ‘j/m/n-style’ morpheme, with the variant pronunciations due tointonation-based allomorphy. This leaves three forms to give an analysis for: i ́nːi ̂/umːû,ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and já/mɔ́/nɔ́. The ﬁrst two of these are uncontroversial, being the distal
and medial demonstrative pronouns respectively. The third includes the proximal
demonstrative pronoun, but is also used in all other nominal modiﬁers. One possible
analysis of the syntactic function of this latter morpheme is that it simply marks
modiﬁcation generally. However, this does not account for the fact that the medial
and distal demonstratives do not exhibit this marking, whereas the proximal demonstrative, along with relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, does. In section
5.4.2 it was therefore argued that a better analysis is to assume that the three forms
já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû represent the three demonstrative pronouns and that
other Katcha nominal modiﬁers are phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun. All
modiﬁers stand in a relationship of apposition to the modiﬁed noun. This approach
allows a uniﬁed treatment of the various types of modiﬁer, including the medial and
distal demonstratives. It is supported by the fact that there are no words in Katcha5.6. Conclusion93which can be unambiguously categorised as determiners or adjectives; lexical nouns
appear to form complete noun phrases which do not allow phrase-internal modiﬁcation.
Nominal modiﬁcation is therefore achieved by apposition of an external phrase.
Finally, as noted in section 5.5, the analysis adopted here can be placed in a wider
context within African linguistics. The demonstrative which heads the appositional
modiﬁer shows gender agreement with the head noun, thereby encoding the function
of ‘Attribution’ and connecting the modiﬁer with the head. In this way it acts as
a relative marker of the type found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages. A
prototypical relative marker is not a pronoun and indeed the demonstrative does not
show the subordinate clause case marking that would be expected of a relative pronoun.
Nonetheless, it was argued in section 5.4.2 that the demonstrative is best considered
to be a pronoun. So it is not a fully prototypical relative marker, though it may be
in process of being grammaticalized as such. Similarly, the possessive construction in
Katcha does not alter the form of the head noun and therefore is not quite an example
of the construct state found in many African languages, but it does represent the
kind of structure from which such a phenomenon could develop. Construing nominal
modiﬁers as appositional phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun not only provides
a uniﬁed analysis of the Katcha data, but also gives an example of one way in which
two seemingly unrelated, typically African constructions might derive from a common
source.","[111, 112]"
"For this reason, the LINK-COPY Introduction rule for English, which is described as ‘language-idiosyncratic’
by Kempson et al. (2001:117), is abandoned in Cann et al. (2005:114) and replaced with
a lexical entry for a phonologically null relative complementizer. This is not an ideal
solution either because Dynamic Syntax does not generally invoke silent morphemes or
empty categories; any actions that cannot be ascribed to the lexical entry of a particular
morpheme (or type of morpheme) would be expected to reside in the computational
system. English bare relatives therefore pose something of a challenge to DS. They
are relatively easy to account for, either by computational rule or by lexical entry, but
both solutions are somewhat stipulative.
In this context, the fact that Katcha prepositional phrases can be analysed as
making use of the same rule as English bare relatives suggests that perhaps this rule
is not as idiosyncratic as previously thought. It certainly lends plausibility to the
suggestion that the computational system may be the right place to put this kind
of anaphoric, term-expanding action after all. If computational rules are genuinely
optional, the possibility must be left open that there may be some rules which are used
only rarely. It is true that a rule found to be used in only one language would be
suspicious, but rather than being limited to English bare relatives, the LINK-COPY
action is also required for recursive prepositional phrases in Katcha - thus it has been
independently motivated for two diﬀerent constructions in two diﬀerent languages.",[212]

it. The analysis given here formalises that hypothesis: these phrases give rise to a202Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseconjuction of locative propositions, one conjunct from the ka phrase and one from the

outlined above. The locative prepositional phrase expresses a proposition which holds
of a term; in that sense, it is adjectival in character. As described in section 9.1,
the treatment given to such prepositional phrases here is reminiscent of the standard
Dynamic Syntax treatment of relative clauses (Kempson et al. 2001; Cann et al. 2005):
the preposition projects a predicate which holds of some term and this is expressed
in a LINKed tree. The second type of prepositional phrase, as described in section
9.3, expresses a modiﬁcation of a predicate; in that sense, it is adverbial in character.
The treatment given to such phrases here is to make use of the standard DS action of
LINK Apposition: the preposition projects a predicate which holds of some predicate9.5. Applicatives203and this is expressed in a LINKed tree. These two types of modiﬁcation are then
brought together by assuming that the predicate modiﬁed by the locative adverb is the
predicate projected by the preposition. The account given here also explains why these
words display behaviour which has led previous authors to analyse them variously as
postpositions (Stevenson 1941; Reh 1983) or as adverbs (Dimmendaal 1987). They are
adverbs because they modify a predicate, but they are very much part of the locative
adpositional phrase. The fact that adpositions are construed as projecting predicates
is crucial to this explanation.","[219, 220, 221, 222]"
"Only subjects can be directly relativised in Katcha. There is no subject agreement
marker on the verb in a relative clause, being replaced by the relative marker. Verb
stems always begin with a vowel, and the vowel of the (ﬁrst) relative marker in subject
relatives elides. At the end of the relative clause is the marker já/mɔ́/nɔ́. Both relative
markers display agreement with the gender of the head noun (5.18):

Non-subject relatives are formed in a similar, but slightly diﬀerent, way. As with
subject relatives, the subordinate clause is enclosed by relative markers which show
agreement with the head noun. However, the internal structure of the relative clause
is diﬀerent: a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked by the dependent clause marker ka
(and sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). A resumptive pronoun is also common; this
does not occur in the case of subject relatives. (5.19a-c) give examples of direct objects
being relativised for masculine, feminine and plural gender nouns respectively. (5.20)
demonstrates the relativisation of an indirect object and (5.21) gives an example of an
oblique argument being relativised. Note that in these examples the word following the
(intial) relative marker, the subject of the relative clause, begins with a consonant and
the relative marker is consequently realised as [já/má/ná], rather than the [j-/m-/n-]
seen in the subject relative examples.

Where the subject of the relative clause is a personal pronoun the oblique formof the pronoun is used. All pronouns begin with vowels; the vowel of the relative
marker assimilates to the vowel of the pronoun and the relative marker cliticises to
the pronoun. (5.22a-c) give examples of object relatives beginning with a pronoun

In Katcha adjectives do not form a separate grammatical category, but are a type of
verb. There is some evidence of a slight morphological distinction between adjectival
verbs and more prototypical verbs (an additional morpheme marking semantic plural
in the case of adjectives), but with regard to agreement, adjectives show normal verbal
morphology and behave in the same way as any other intransitve verb.
When used predicatively as in (5.28-5.30b), adjectives take the usual verbal subject
agreement preﬁxes (cf 5.28-5.30a).

Assuming attributive adjectives to be relative clauses, there are three kinds of nominal
modiﬁers in Katcha: demonstratives, possessive noun phrases and relative clauses.
These are indicated by the presence of the morphemes listed in table 5.2. Aside from
the medial and distal demonstratives, these three types of nominal modiﬁers are clearly
all related. All three are introduced by similar morphemes showing agreement with the
head noun. It is worth considering the nature of this relation in more detail and in
particular, the question of whether the proximal demonstrative, the possessive marker
and the relative marker are all the same morpheme and, if so, how this chould be
characterised.
Stevenson (1941) takes a conservative descriptive line, taking the common element
to be just the j-/m-/n- gender agreement preﬁxes, which then attach to diﬀerent
morphemes. Thus, in his view, these gender preﬁxes may attach to the demonstrative
stem -a/-ɔ (Stevenson 1941:58), to the ‘genitive particle’ -a (Stevenson 1941:47) and‘possessive pronouns’ eːte, etc. (Stevenson 1941:48), and to verbs (Stevenson 1941:68).
Although Stevenson does not explicitly state it as such, this approach essentially
analyses the j-/m-/n- preﬁxes as a general marker of nominal modiﬁers. However,whilst it seems correct to a large extent, such an analysis does not go far enough in
that it does not incorporate the medial and demonstrative pronouns, which agree in
gender with the head noun, yet do not carry these preﬁxes. This fact is signiﬁcant for
the hypothesis that j-/m-/n- are preﬁxes which mark modiﬁcation generally, because
whilst the existence of a ‘general modiﬁcation’ marker does not preclude the existence
of other constructions, it is surprising to ﬁnd that the possessives and relatives pattern
with the proximal demonstrative, while the medial and distal demonstratives do not.
The remainder of this chapter proposes an alternative analysis which uniﬁes the account
of the three types of nominal modiﬁer, ﬁts the overall patterns of Katcha morphosyntax,
and accounts for the medial and distal demonstratives. The proposed analysis is that
all nominal modiﬁers in Katcha are headed by an initial demonstrative pronoun.

There is evidence to suggest that the já/má/ná found with possessors and at thebeginning of relative clauses is a phonologically conditioned allomorph of the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
found in demonstrative noun phrases and at the end of relative clauses.
There are notable phonetic diﬀerences between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]"
"6.6 Pronominal case
It has been argued throughout this chapter that the morphemes which specify oblique
argument roles in Katcha are better described as prepositions than as case markers.
This is on the basis that these oblique arguments do not generally have their form
assigned obligatorily by the verb. This is not the same for pronouns, the form of which
clearly is determined by some governing element, either the verb or a preposition. There
is therefore a strong argument for describing the forms of the pronouns as cases. This
is particularly true for the core pronouns where tone seems to play a role.
As noted in section 6.1.1, it may be that the case of the core pronouns is marked
by their tone melody. The use of tone to mark case is extremely rare in a global
perspective and arguably does not exist at all outwith Africa, but is common in eastern
Africa: ‘tone as a marker for case is the most salient feature of case behaviour in
Africa’ (König 2008:224). There are a couple of comments to be made regarding the
fact that Katcha may exhibit tonal case. One is a typological implication: the case
alignment is likely to be ‘marked-nominative’. Marked-nominative systems display the
same alignment as accusative case systems; that is, the subjects of both transitive
and intransitive clauses (the S and A arguments) are marked in the same way, while
the object of a transitive clause (the P argument) is treated diﬀerently. However, in
a prototypical marked-nominative language, the accusative form is functionally and
morphologically unmarked, acting as the default form, whilst the nominative form is
morphologically marked with its use restricted to the realisation of S and A arguments.
In that sense, marked-nominative systems are slightly reminiscent of ergative systems.
Like tonal case, marked-nominative systems are rare from a global perspective, but
‘constitute the most widespread type of case systems in Africa’ (König 2008:138). More
signiﬁcantly,
‘there is a connection between case expressed by tone and the existence of
a marked-nominative system… If case is expressed by tone then there is a
marked-nominative system.’ (König 2008:198,224)
Therefore it is to be expected that if Katcha has tonal case it will have a marked-124Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsnominative alignment.9
A further interesting observation is that within tonal case systems it is particularly
common for low tone to be the marker of Nominative case, which appears to be the
case in Katcha. This tendency appears to be a universal feature of both the Cushitic
(Afro-Asiatic) and Nilotic (Nilo-Saharan) families. There are other language families
with tonal case which use other tone patterns to mark Nominative, but in Cushitic
and Nilotic, ‘the nominative is always expressed by loss of a high tone, triggering a
low tone’ (König (2008:223), citing Tosco (1994)). In the context of the ongoing debate
about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family, this is notable because Katcha nominals
share characteristics with both of these families. The tripartite number marking system
described in chapter 4 as being common in Nilo-Saharan is particularly prevalent in
Nilotic, and this is also one of the few branches of Nilo-Saharan with a masculinefeminine gender system. Also in chapter 4, it was demonstrated that Katcha’s highly
unusual gender system is found in several Cushitic languages. So whether it is a genetic
or areal trait or a typological correlation, it seems that Katcha nominals do not only
share features of number and gender with Nilotic and Cushitic languages, but also case.
It is important at this point to state the caveat that there remains a great deal
that is unclear about the tonal system of Katcha, and a good percentage of my textual
data originally comes from written sources which do not mark tone at all. As such,
conclusions about tonal behaviour should be treated as tentative. It is plausible that
the diﬀerences in tone melody on pronouns which have been ascribed to case may in
fact be conditioned by other factors, such as intonation or position in the sentence.
Nonetheless, given its geographical location, it would not be surprising to ﬁnd case
marked by tone in Katcha.
If the tone variation on core pronouns is indeed a marker of the Nominative and
Accusative cases, it may be that the oblique form of the pronouns described in section
6.1.2 should also be thought of as a case, presumably ‘Oblique’ case. It is diﬀerent from
the tonal case exhibitied in core pronouns, however, in that it is not assigned by verbs
but by prepositions.
Pronominal case can be summarised as follows. The verb assigns tonal case, which
I tentatively take to be Nominative and Accusative, to the core arguments. Peripheral
arguments are not generally marked by case, but by prepositions (though see section
9.6 for discussion of the status of dative a). These prepositions also assign case, either
Accusative (section 6.2.1), Oblique (section 6.2.2) or a mixture of both (section 6.2.3).
9König (2008:198) suggests that this correlation is an absolute universal in the case of nouns, but
that with pronouns tonal marking may also be found in a few languages with accusative case alignment.
The question of whether Katcha nouns exhibit tonal case alternations remains open, pending a fuller
investigation of tone. It could be that case is only relevant to pronouns, in which case the possibility
exists that Katcha is one of the small number of exceptions with an accusative system realised by tone.","[142, 143]"

When the accompaniment preposition is followed by a personal pronoun, the pronouns
take the same form as they do with the dative: 1st and 2nd person pronouns are core
pronouns, while 3rd person pronouns are taken from the oblique set. As with the
dative, the vowel of the preposition is elided with the core pronouns in 1st and 2nd

Tones are also the same as with the dative. Thus in the context of an utterance such

the same mix of pronouns as the dative and accompaniment. Tones and vowel elision/assimilation are likewise identical. Thus in the context of an utterance such as
(6.43), the directional pronouns are realised as in (6.44).4

Locative
The preposition ká is a general locative. Speciﬁc locative relations are expressed by
adverbs which are used in conjuction with the locative preposition (see section 6.4
below). But ká may be used on its own where the relation is basic (‘in’, ‘on’, ‘at’, ‘to’
etc.) or perhaps where the precise relation is clear from context. Some examples are
given in (6.14-6.17).

The preposition kɪ ́tta refers to a relation of posession between its complement and some
location, i.e. ‘place of’, ‘house of’. It may be used with or without a head noun, i.e.
the possessed location may be speciﬁed or not. Where there is no explicit head noun,kɪ ́tta is interpreted as ‘X’s place’ or ‘X’s house’, as in (6.18).

When the locative is followed by a personal pronoun, the pronoun is taken from the
oblique pronouns. As is standard in Katcha, elision and/or assimilation occur when two
vowels come together. Thus when spoken in the context of a sentence such as (6.22),
the vowel of the locative preposition is deleted, and the initial vowel of the pronoun
takes a high tone (6.23).","[120, 121]"
"80Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Nominal Modiﬁers5.4.2 Nominal modiﬁers as demonstrative pronouns — Morphosyntactic
evidence.
Having noted the evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are phonologically conditioned
allomorphs, the question arises as to the nature of this morpheme. Based on the
morphosyntactic properties presented in sections 5.1-5.3, this section argues that it is
in fact the proximal demonstrative pronoun, acting as head of the modiﬁer phrase. A
possible alternative answer is that the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morpheme is simply a general marker
of modiﬁcation. The latter suggestion does not ﬁt the Katcha data as well as the
analysis proposed here but it should be noted that the two analyses are related, and in
section 5.5.2 it is speculated that Katcha may be in the midst of a move from one to
the other.
It was demonstrated in sections 5.1-5.3 that demonstratives, possessive noun phrases
and relative clauses all display the same morphosyntactic properties with respect to
gender agreement, the modiﬁcation of peripheral arguments and pronominal use. Some
relevant examples are repeated below (5.36-5.44).4

The data in (5.36-5.44) demonstrate that relative markers, possessive markers and

The medial and distal demonstratives behave exactly like all other modiﬁers, except
that they do not take j-/m-/n- ‘preﬁxes’. This concurs with the evidence presentedin the preceding sections that j-/m-/n- are not preﬁxes which attach to modiﬁers,
but are themselves the modiﬁers. Moreover, the only nominal modiﬁers which arenot of the form já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are the medial and distal demonstratives. If the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
morpheme which introduces a possessive noun phrase or a relative clause is the proximal demonstrative, then there is a uniﬁed analysis which accounts for all examples:
nouns in Katcha may be modiﬁed only by demonstratives, or by phrases headed by
demonstratives.
As mentioned in section 5.1.2, there is evidence that demonstratives should be considered pronouns rather than determiners; in fact, there are no determiners in Katcha.
Since there are also no adjectives, Katcha has no modiﬁers that are unambiguously
internal to the noun phrase. This suggests that lexical nouns form complete noun
phrases and cannot be modiﬁed directly, from within the noun phrase. That is to say,
a noun phrase (in Minimalist terms, a DP) may be made up only of a noun. The
demonstrative is a pronoun which can be considered to stand in apposition with the
noun, taking its reference anaphorically. (5.2′ ) & (5.6c′ ) repeat some of the examples
given earlier, with an altered free translation which is more reﬂective of this analysis:

In the case of possessives and relative clauses, the same analysis can be put forward. The
anaphorically resolved demonstrative heads the modiﬁer phrase which is appositional to5.4. A uniﬁed analysis for nominal modiﬁers

the demonstrative, has simply taken the place of another, the subject marker (5.18′ ):

Katcha using a construction parallel to that used for possessives. The relative clause
is non-ﬁnite or nominalised, as indicated by the dependent clause marker ka (and
also sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). Thus non-subject relatives can be seen asa ‘possessive’ relation holding between two ‘nominals’: the head noun, and the event
described by the relative clause. (5.21′ ) & (5.22b′ ) repeat examples given earlier, with
glosses and free translations more reﬂective of this analysis.

It should be noted that the morpheme at the end of a relative clause does not
quite ﬁt the analysis as explained here. It does not seem to be appositional to any
other nouns and does not take a t- preﬁx when within an oblique phrase. Both of
these facts follow from its position at the end of the clause in that it does not directly
follow the modiﬁed noun, and the t- preﬁx attaches to the clause-initial morpheme.
Note also that its status is somewhat unclear. Stevenson (1956-57:63-64) states that it
marks deﬁniteness, implying that it is optional. If this were true, the analysis should
be straightforward, conﬁrming the morpheme to be a demonstrative. On the other
hand, Gilley (2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine nouns, optional
for feminine, and unattested for plural, which would make the analysis somewhat
trickier. Neither of these descriptions quite match my data: the relative clause-ﬁnal
marker seems to be present fairly consistently. Interestingly though, in chapter 10
a Dynamic Syntax analysis of Katcha relative clauses is given which assumes the
clause-ﬁnal relative marker to be a demonstrative. On the basis of that assumption it
transpires that the role of the ﬁnal morpheme is to contribute deﬁniteness; in other
words, Stevenson is predicted to be correct.
The analysis that nominal modiﬁers comprise noun phrases in apposition, gets
some extra support from the wider tendencies of Katcha syntax, in that Katcha has a
tendency also to put verbs and clauses in apposition. Thus, while (5.49) is a perfectly
grammatical way of expressing the proposition ‘Kuku is a tall man’, (5.50) is equally
grammatical, and probably more common.","[98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]"

Theoretical Analyses147Chapter 8Verb Extensions
Introduction
In chapter 7, it was noted that the majority of verb extensions in Katcha are detransitivising and that these valency-reducing VEs can be classiﬁed according to two features,
namely the thematic role played by the syntactic subject and the number of arguments
expressed. This classiﬁcation is summarised in table 7.1, repeated here as table 8.1.

(Process)Table 8.1: Valency-reducing verb extensions and their argument rolesThe distinction between active and antipassive, and between passive and unaccusative/middle voice, is an important one. Katcha is pro-drop, so any semantic
argument may be phonologically unrealised. However, the active (unmarked) form
and the passive form of the verb each take two semantic arguments. Note that while
passive may be deﬁned as reducing the verb’s syntactic valency by demoting the agent to
the status of a (usually implied) oblique argument, the semantic valency is unchanged:
there exists both an agent and a patient, even if the agent is only there by implication.
This contrasts with the other forms, the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice,
each of which take only one semantic argument.
Valency reduction is something of a challenge for standard formal semantics.1 A
1Proponents of ’radical dissociation’ do not have this problem, but Dynamic Syntax takes a classical149150Theoretical Analyses: Verb Extensionstransitive verb expresses a relation, which by deﬁnition requires two arguments, raising
the question of how a proposition with a ‘missing’ argument should be modelled. One
approach is to allow the ‘missing’ argument role to be taken by some object of minimal
semantic content, an object whose reference is both arbitrary and entirely contextdependent. Thus the agent of some unaccusative verb V in a given situation s is simply
‘the V er in s’. An unaccusative sentence like ‘Drums are beaten’ can be thought of
informally as meaning ‘Drums are beaten (by the agent of drum-beating)’ or ‘Drums are
beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’. This contrasts with passive verbs, which
have two semantic arguments, even if the agent happens to be phonologically unrealised.
A passive sentence like ‘Drums are being beaten’ can thought of informally as ‘Drums
are being beaten (by him/her/it)’ or ‘Drums are being beaten (by someone/something)’.
This chapter presents a Dynamic Syntax analysis of such constructions. Section
8.1 introduces the DS formalism and illustrates its use in a straightforward Katcha
sentence with an active, transitive verb. Section 8.2 introduces the concept of epsilon
terms. Dynamic Syntax construes all terms as terms of the epsilon calculus, and this
provides a straightforward way to model the kind of term described in the previous
paragraph . An epsilon term picks out an arbitrary witness of some predicate and this
predicate can be easily deﬁned as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus
the epsilon calculus allows us to deﬁne, with relative ease, structures such as ‘Kuku is
laughing (at some arbitrary object of Kuku’s laughter)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by some
arbitrary agent of drum beating)’ and section 8.2 presents an analysis of antipassive
verbs in Katcha in these terms. It is argued that the lexical actions associated with the
antipassive suﬃx build a context-dependent epsilon structure at the logical object node.
Section 8.3 discusses passives, the implementation of which is very straightforward: it
is simply a case of moving the pointer to ensure that the sentential subject decorates
the logical object node. This analysis highlights the fact that the passive has a more
referential interpretation for the agent, in contrast with the arbitrary interpretations
of the ‘missing’ arguments of the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice. Section
8.4 discusses unaccusative, the analysis of which is straightforward, following directly
from the discussion in the previous two sections. Section 8.5 is slightly more speculative,
considering what the analysis of middle voice might look like if it were to be treated as a
sequence of unaccusative, followed by antipassive. Somewhat remarkably, under such an
analysis, middle voice turns out to be truth conditionally equivalent to unaccusative but
to carry extra information which might be interpreted as adding intensity, as suggested
by Stevenson (cf section 7.2.5).

brings about the tree in (10.16), which can be evaluated using the rule of Appositive
LINK Evaluation (10.9) to produce a single epsilon term with a conjoint restrictor
(ϵx , (Cow′ (x) ∧ Eat′ (ϵy , Grass′ (y))(x))) as the logical object of the matrix proposition.
The analysis outlined here ultimately gives a result which models the Katcha
data very well. There are three salient features of demonstratives in Katcha which
were presented in chapter 5: ﬁrstly, demonstratives are pronouns; secondly, they
are appositional to the modiﬁed noun; thirdly, they ascribe deﬁniteness to the noun
phrase, there being no separate lexical category of determiners. The lexical actions
for the demonstrative proposed here project three nodes which are reﬂective of these
three respective features: a metavariable, a nominal variable identical to that of the
modiﬁed noun, and an epsilon binding operator. When these lexical actions interact10.2. Subject Relatives235with standard Dynamic Syntax rules such as LINK Apposition and standard epsilon
calculus semantics, the expected interpretation of subject relative clauses falls out quite
naturally.
It should be noted that this account of subject relatives leads obligatorily to the
relativised noun phrase having an indeﬁnite interpretation. This might seem surprising since the relativising particle is the demonstrative pronoun, which is usually
associated with a deﬁnite interpretation; somewhere along the way it appears that
the demonstrative has lost its ability to ascribe deﬁnitenesss to the noun it modiﬁes.
The explanation of this puzzle is in the incremental nature of Dynamic Syntax. DS
characterises pronouns as underspeciﬁed metavariables which are subsequently updated.
The deﬁniteness of a pronoun does not come from the pronoun itself, but from the term
which later instantiates the metavariable. The fact that there is a unique, identiﬁable
referent for a noun phrase is a matter of pragmatics, not lexicon. As a case in point,
so-called deﬁnite determiners like the in English are frequently used in non-deﬁnite
contexts, such as generic expressions.
In the case of a Katcha demonstrative noun phrase like fɪjɔ mɔ́, ‘this cow’, in (10.1),
the demonstrative pronoun does ascribe deﬁniteness to the phrase. This is because
the metavariable is resolved by Substitution and the context will supply a deﬁnite,
identiﬁable referent. The demonstrative pronoun, by its anaphoric nature, provides
an opening for a deﬁnite referent for the noun phrase; the ϵ-operator projected by the
demonstrative is supplemented by the ι-operator provided by the substituend. The
demonstrative pronoun thereby causes the noun phrase to be deﬁnite. In the case
of a relative clause, the metavariable is not resolved by Substitution, but instead
is resolved when the tree is compiled following the parsing of the verb (and any
complements). There is no opportunity for any further update to the binding operator
and consequently that node remains decorated with an ϵ-binder and the noun phrase
remains indeﬁnite.
The prediction that relativised nouns in Katcha can only be indeﬁnite has a nice
consequence, in that it explains the second instance of the demonstrative pronoun
at the end of the relative clause. In my data, this clause-ﬁnal pronoun is present
quite consistently but previous researchers have not found this to be the case. Gilley
(2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine, optional for feminine and absent
for plural nouns, though she does not attempt to give any further analysis. Stevenson
(1956-57:61,63), however, ﬁnds that the clause-ﬁnal demonstrative is optional and states
