"NEGsigive.birth14.2.1.2. Bias in yes/no questions
Quite often, perhaps usually, a speaker expects one response rather than the
other to a yes/no question. Sometimes this bias does not seem to overtly affect the form of the question. Thus la and bi questions are apparently neutral
in form, although in context either an affirmative or a negative answer may
be anticipated. Ti and tähä questions, on the other hand, are always heavily
biased. It is not possible to say exactly what the bias is from the form of the
question. Both positive and negative questions may have both positive and
negative bias. All that the use of tiltähä seems to contribute is the information that bias is present. Positive bias (i.e. expectation of a 'yes' answer, indicating the hearer believes in the truth of the positive proposition, or the
truth of the positive proposition corresponding to the negative one) is more
common than negative bias. All four examples of tiltähä questions in the
previous section (23) and (25) have positive bias. However, both positive
and negative questions can also have negative bias, as the following examples show:

It should be noted that ordinary third person anaphoric pronouns cannot be
put in the focus position. Emphatic pronouns must be used instead:

There are logically three ways that a cleft construction can combine with
negation: 1) the focused part is negated, and the presupposed part affirmative ('it wasn't X that did Y'); 2) the focused part is affirmative, and the presupposed part negated ('it was X that didn't Y'); or 3) both parts can be negated ('it wasn't X that didn't Y'). Of these, only 1) occurs unelicited in the
corpus. The practical occasions in which the addressee mistakenly believes12.1. Focus constructions 473
X to have not done Y are much rarer than those in which s/he mistakenly
believes X to have done Y. In 1) and 3) above, the negation of the focused
element is indicated by placing after it the negative identifier bä 'it is not'.
The negative clause final particle which goes with it is placed not after this
initial clause, but at the end of the sentence, after the presupposed clause.
The syntactic role of the focused item is recovered in exactly the same way
as in affirmative clefts. Following are examples with various syntactic roles
focused. They are all type 1) above, viz. with focus, but affirmative presupposed clause. Note that many of them are cast in the form of negative yes/no
questions, which have a strong bias toward an affirmative response, just as
in English.

As stated above, only elicited examples are available of clefts in which the
focused part is affirmative while the presupposed part is negative. Speakers
do not appear to be at all uncomfortable in producing such sentences, though
they are apparently used much less frequently than the type just illustrated
above. They differ from simple affirmative clefts strikingly in that they require a copula (pye 'be') to follow the focused item. The focused item is the
(focused) subject of this copula, a fact shown by the addition of a ^ r e f e r e n tial pronoun between the noun phrase and the copula. The presupposed
clause follows, with negation marked as it would be in a simple clause.
When the syntactic role of the focused noun phrase is subject of the presupposed clause, there is a coreferential pronoun as the beginning of the latter:
(15)Zhy6 u pye u pye
a
kärd mi.
Zhye he be he NEG PERF go
NEG
'It was Zhye who didn't go.'","[495, 496, 497]"
"IND NEG PERF come NEG
'No one has come.'
does not ordinarily mean that a particular person unknown to the hearer did
not come, though with some considerable prompting some speakers have
been willing to admit that it might mean this. Even the combination of definite noun with indefinite determiner, the form generally used to introduce
important referential indefinite participants in narrative, cannot be referential when the subject of a negative sentence. Compare the two uses of this
construction in the following example, one in an affirmative the other in a
negative clause:
(182)NAifjwäυ mpyiηάcydekii.man.DEF IND he was with women ten with
Ά certain man had ten wives.
CedrjiwämpyinasäJiä pyätami.woman.DEF IND PAST PROG YET child get NEG
None of the women had yet gotten a child.'
The negative clause cannot mean that a certain one of the women had not
gotten a child, though the same noun phrase in the affirmative counterpart of
this sentence would be interpreted as referential in this way.
In a similar fashion, quantifiers in the subject noun phrase also attract the
negation. The following example manifestly does not mean that no domestic
animal is taxed (i.e. with punf 'all' falling outside the scope of negation
rather than within it). Everyone knows, on the contrary, that taxes are levied
on sheep, goats, cows, and donkeys.
(183)Känhä yätbbripunivillage domestic.animals.DEF all
'The tax of all domestic animals
ßyenawwülämpüqitax.DEFme.",[411]
"NEGIn contrast to negative tä! tähä questions, negative mä/ä questions are routinely biased to a positive response. The two examples in (24) in the previous section both expect consent to the truth of the corresponding affirmative
declarative. This is the most common pattern with negative yes/no questions
cross-linguistically (see Givön 1990, chapter 18).",[553]
"376Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negation9.4. Negation
As in many West African languages, negation in Supyire is a rather complicated affair from the point of view of marking. The first part of this section
will accordingly deal with the various types of negative marking in simple
clauses. There follows a short section on negative polarity items. The next,
more substantial, subsection deals with the scope of negation, in particular
looking at indefinite subjects and subjects with quantifiers. Next comes a
section dealing with negation in complex sentences. Since these sentence
types have not been covered in the preceding chapters in any detail, this subsection is merely a brief summary of material to be treated in later chapters.
A final section deals with word and phrase negation.","[398, 399]"
"This type of paraphrasing is cultivated by people who pride themselves in
their rhetorical skill. In certain types of discourse, notably expository, it is
quite frequently used. The above example is extracted from a discourse SO
clauses long, of which exactly half (25) of the clauses are parallel in this
way.
This is not to say that the paraphrase type of sentence is not found in other
discourse types, and spoken by relatively unskilled speakers. A common
subtype consists in restating in a negative clause what has just been said in
an affirmative clause, or vice versa. Following are examples, both produced
by younger speakers not particularly noted for their speaking skills:

"726Notes: Chapter 1058. One such segmental negative auxiliary (J) appears in the speech of very
old people in a very restricted environement (see below). Cebaara has a
present tense negative auxiliary with low tone: d (Mills 1987).
59. The Wara is one of the three major masks of the Kampwo Supyire (the
other two being the Komo and the Kono), and corresponds to the Nya of
the Bambara. The sij6r6 is the annual ceremony in which the mask
""comes out"".
60. The cognate of this auxiliary in Sucite (yl) is apparently the common
way of marking negation in the auxiliary position (Garber 1987: 36).
61. Siga 'doubt' is borrowed from from Bambara siga or sigi 'to doubt'.
62. Jäcyi'importance'
is borrowed from Bambara jati*to count, consider'.
63. Piteti ' m a y b e ' is borrowed from French peut-etre.
64. The etymology of the second part of the word is unknown. It may be
related to -fyin 'white', but the tone is wrong.
65. This means that the clause must be recognizable as a relative clause on
other grounds. The use of a relative pronoun is of course diagnostic, but
these are used only in a minority of relative clauses. In the absence of a
relative pronoun, the placement of a noun phrase in focus position at the
head of the clause, coupled with the absence of the negative identifier
which marks a negative cleft (see below), suffices to indicate a relative
clause.
66. The copular auxiliary jiye in this example is required when the progressive occurs in a presuppositional clause, and is not the negative marker.
67. Karadanti is borrowed from French carte d'identity. The speaker is a
student visiting the zoo in Bamako and wishing to claim the student discount on the entrance fee. A student identity card is required to obtain
the discount, but the speaker has forgotten to bring his.
68. Since the copula ßye does not take any negative marking in auxiliary
position, the assigning of the negation to the main clause in sentences
like this must be by default: the complement clause is affirmative, consequently the negation must be located in the main clause.
69. It may seem odd to speak of obligation in connection with rain. This example, however, is taken from a discussion about rainmakers.
70. Jatigd is borrowed from Bambara jätigi 'host'. The proverb refers to the
fact that in order to obtain a wife you must have a host in her village
who will be your intermediary with her family.","[748, 749]"
"9.4.1.3. Negative polarity items
Supyire does not have a large set of negative polarity items (i.e. words or
phrases which can appear only in negative clauses). As will be shown in the
next section, it gets along fine without negative quantifiers. There is one
quantifier, however, which can only be used in negative clauses: yafyin. It
appears to contain the root ya- 'thing', 6 4 and can be translated variously as
'anything', 'a thing', or 'nothing'. It is not commonly used, and only three
unelicited examples occur in the corpus. Here are two of them:
(172)a. Mii flya ä
yafytn
ta
mi.
I
NEG PERF anything get NEG
Ί didn't get anything.'",[408]
"390Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negationWe turn now to complex constructions in which negation is rather more
common. Negative clefts are frequently used. They are formed by placing
the focused item at the head of the clause followed by the negative identifier
bä 'it is not'. Then follows the 'out of focus' clause, which is affirmative,
and last of all comes the final negative marker mi or mä:
(186)Cyäge
kd e bä
place.DEF IND in it.is.not
'It is not in any particular place
mii pye na
u tää
mi.66
I
be PROG it get.IMPFV NEG
that I am getting it.'","[412, 413]"
"The adverb puno, related to the quantifier puni'all', has a particular affinity for negative clauses, where is acts as a reinforcer meaning roughly 'at
all'. Although one example has been recorded in an affirmative sentence
(see chapter 7, section 7.6), for all the speakers I consulted on the issue puno
was acceptable only in negative sentences. Following is an example (see the
section referred to above for another example):
(173)U pye
a
kyä kyaäre
e punu mä.
he NEG PERF eat meat.DEF in at.all NEG
'He didn't eat any of the meat at all.'",[409]
"There are numerous restrictions in the use of individual adverbs. For example, though puno 'completely' (from the universal quantifier pun/'alV, itself derived from the adjective root puN- 'all') can occur in affirmative
sentences, as in (117a), it is much more frequent in negative clauses, as in
(117b), where it has the function of intensifying the negation, meaning
roughly 'at all':

'They would really finish you off.'

"The same use of repeated yds can be used to code disjunctive clauses, meaning roughly 'whether...or...'. The clauses must contain either a pair of anto-15.3. Clause chaining in narrative597nyms or must be opposed as affirmative and negative. Moreover, they must
be related to a third clause. They can be the preposed complements of an irrealis clause with the verb cey for example:

prohibitive auxiliary kä may also be said to be marked with the negative low
tone.
A minor and probably archaic negative auxiliary ) also carries the negative
low tone. 60 So far this auxiliary has only been recorded with the copula sii,
and only in the speech of very old people. In the speech of younger people,
sii in its copular function must be preceded by the perfect auxiliary, and this
is negated in the usual way by the addition of jiye.

(166)Κ urucanqk6nawyeri)s))that(EMPH) day.DEF on medicine NEG be.EMPH
'At that time (lit. on that day) there was really no medicine
ηύnami.cow on NEG
for cows.'
A couple of tense-aspects do not take any negative marking in the auxiliary position. In one of these, the habitual, the auxiliary (mäha) already begins with a low tone, and the addition of a negative low tone would therefore
go unnoticed:
(167)U mäha ßenaaküjöit HAB agree SC it
swallow
'It ( = the python) doesn't agree to swallow it ( = newly shed skin)
urufbdßyii näme.that(EMPH) owner eye on NEG
in the presence of that person.'
The other tense which usually does not have a negative marking in auxiliary position is the potential kü. Here there is no simple explanation for the384Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negationlack of marking as there is with mäha. An example of kü in a negative
clause is:(168) M)) güß-jäηόόme.","[405, 406, 407]"
"14.2.1.3. Focus in yes/no questions
Normally only the information that would be in the focus of assertion in the
corresponding declarative falls under the scope of interrogation in a yes/no
question. This is parallel to the way that negation is attracted to the scope of
assertion, and seems to be a general characteristic of yes/no questions in all
languages (cf. Giv6n 1990, chapter 18). Thus adverbs and adverbial phrases
attract the scope of interrogation, leaving the rest of the clause presupposed
as true. In the following example, there is no question that the addressee has
come. Only the means of arrival is in doubt:
(28)Mu äpanigisügina la?you PERF come bicycle.DEF on Q
'Did you come on bicycle?'
Similarly, quantifiers, even in the subject noun phrase, also attract the scope
of interrogation. In the following example, it is taken for granted that some
of them have arrived. The question therefore falls on the quantifier in particular.
(29)Piρυηάäpala?they all
PERF come Q
'Have they all come?'
It was pointed out in section 12.1 of chapter 12 that information in contrastive focus automatically attracts the focus of assertion. It also consequently
attracts the scope of interrogation. Cleft focus constructions are quite common in yes/no questions. The only part of the proposition which is in the
scope of interrogation is the focused phrase at the head of the sentence.
Following are examples of both positive and negative cleft constructions in
yes/no questions:14.2. Questions531(30) positive clefts:

u a
ύ kän

NEGJust as in declarative clefts, the information in the clause following the focused item is presupposed.
Questions are not necessarily complete clauses. Quite often shared information is simply left unuttered by a speaker, and the yes/no question particle
is appended to the noun or adpositional phrase which is the focus of interrogation. For example, in the following questions, the clause 'Are you a ...',
must be recovered from the context of use:
(32) a. Nämpontjo bä?
guest
Q
'(Are you) a stranger?'
b. Lüüzü la?
hunter Q
'(Are you) a hunter?'
Similarly, occasionaly a speaker will request confirmation of one bit of information that he or she didn't hear properly, or simply can't believe:
(33) a. Kücwuun lä?
monkey
Q
'(Did I hear you say) a monkey?'","[553, 554]"
"9.4.1.2. Negative marking in auxiliary position
Just as with the clause final marking, there are two major kinds of negative
marking in the auxiliary position, as well as some minor ones. They are distributed strictly according to the tense-aspect to be negated. Table 34 summarizes the combinations.
The least complicated marking is that used with the (present) perfect and
the (present) progressive. In these two tense-aspects, the copula pye 'be' is
simply added in front of the perfect or progressive auxiliary. In the examples
above and following, this extra auxiliary is simply glossed NEG, although
etymologically it appears to have nothing to do with negation. With the perfect and progressive auxiliaries, however, it provides a signal of negation
early in the clause: 56
(157)a. M)) pye

mi.
get NEGb. Wüu pye
na
jina pää

we
NEG PROG jinn see.IMPFV NEG
'We don't see (a) jinn.'
This is the only kind of construction in which the copula pye appears
regularly with the perfect marker, but the combination of the progressive
with pye is not unique. If one examines the various constructions in which
pye na appears, an interesting fact emerges: the characteristic they all have
in common is their presuppositional character. Besides the negative, the380Chapter 9: Aspect, tease, modality, and negation

conditionalcombination is used in restrictive relative clauses, in the presupposed (""out
of focus"") part of cleft constructions, and in the presupposed part of constituent questions. These latter three tend to contain presupposed information
in the usual sense. It is therefore interesting that they share the auxiliary
structure of the negative. As Givön (1989: 159; see also Giv6n 1979, 1984)
points out, negatives are used in a context in which the corresponding affirmative is ""presupposed""—not in a strictly logical sense, of course, but in
the sense that the speaker judges that the information is being or might possibly be entertained by the hearer. 57
More widespread, in terms of the number of different tense-aspects it occurs with, is the other major negative marking in auxiliary position. It is
used exclusively with auxiliaries with high tone (the majority), and consists
of a floating low which is introduced to the left of the auxiliary and docks
rightwards on to it. Presumably the low tone is all that is left of an earlier
negative auxiliary with some sort of segmental form and a low tone. 58 Examples of negatives in each tense-aspect follow, beginning with the futures.
Here the negative low tone simply replaces the high of the auxiliary:9.4. Negation

'It (the bushcat) will not try (lit. agree) to come here.'","[402, 403, 404]"
"A similar situation obtains with the middle of the scale of strength of manipulation. Verbs coding strong manipulation, such as pyi ' m a k e ' , tun
'send', and tege 'help', do not allow Neg-raising. In fact only the relatively
weak 'want' is compatible with it. The most common way to express 'want'
in Supyire is by means of a construction meaning literally ' X ' s desire is' followed by a subjunctive complement clause. Here, just as reported for other
languages (cf. Horn 1989: 315; Giv6n 1984: 343), a sentence with ""raised""
negation is weaker, and consequently more polite than the corresponding
sentence with the negation in the complement clause:
(196)a. negation in main clause
Ml) lä
βye mu ύ
shyä
my desire be you SUBJUNC go
Ί don't want you to go.'me.6*
NEGb. negation in complement
Mi) Jä
ßye ma
ha
zhyä mi.
my desire be you.NONDECL PROH F P . g o N E G
Ί want you not to go.'
Not surprisingly, the ""raised"" version is much more common than the
""unraised"" version. When both clauses have the same subject (and consequently the main predication is more like a modality verb than a manipulative one), only the ""raised"" version is permitted. There is thus no counterpart
of example (197) with the negation in the complement rather than in the
main clause. Note that the subject of the complement clause is omitted under
identity with the main clause subject:
(197)Mi) Ιέ
ßye si
shyä
my desire be SUBJUNC go
Ί don't want to go.'me.
NEG9.4. Negation395Finally, among verbs expressing obligation, the verb yaa 'ought, should' is
compatible with Neg-raising. In fact, no example of a negative complement
of yaa occurs in the corpus, nor have I ever heard one spontaneously produced. The ""unraised"" counterpart of the following was only obtained
through elicitation:
(198)a. negation in main clause

?'The rain oughtyaa

canmpyäa shuunni pyi me.
it PROH days

to not stay away longer than two days/
Before leaving the topic of negation in complex sentences something
should be said about coordinate clauses. The Supyire equivalent of clauses
conjoined by neither...nor is simply a construction in which the first coordinate clause is negated, and the final negative particle is placed after the second clause:
(199)Yii
flye
a
siipyigir6

and.NARR.PROG you.PL-REFL watch.IMPFV NEG
nor (have you) been watching out for each other.'
The same structure may be used for quite different purposes, however. The
following example is syntactically coordinate, but the second clause, by virtue of the serial verb ηά '(only) afterwards', functions in reality like an adverbial 'before' clause. Just as with adverbs and adverbial phrases, this ad-396Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negationverbial clause attracts the scope of negation to itself (or rather, since this is a
negative yes/no question, the adverbial clause is strongly affirmed.)

"9.4. Negation387Aside from these three words, no other negative polarity items have been

"For more examples of negative clefts, see chapter 11, section 11.1.1.
Sentences with complement clauses are like clefts in that the final negative
particle is placed at the end of the sentence, regardless of whether it belongs
logically with the first (main) or second (complement) clause. The placement of the negative marking in auxiliary position of course indicates where
the negation belongs. We will look first at negative complement clauses,
giving an example of each of the three major types of complement clause
(for descriptions of these complement types, as well as of minor types and
their numerous variations, see chapter 11 below). Complements of verbs of
speech and cognition may be either indicative (example (187a) also includes
a negative conditional) or subjunctive ( = prohibitive, as in (187b)):

1990, chapter 16). Only nominal constituents and adverbs can be so focused.
When I attempted to elicit sentences with focus on the verb, I was given examples with the exclamatory particle di, which is widely used not only in
Senufo but also in the surrounding languages. Following is an example:
(18)U a
kärd de!
s/he PERF go
EXCL
'S/he has left! *This particle does not specifically code emphasis on the verb, however, but
rather on whatever item in the sentence is in the focus of assertion. Thus if a
locative adverbial phrase is added to the above example, the focus will be on
it rather than on the verb:
(19)U a
kärd Sukwoo na
s/he PERF go
Sikasso to
'S/he has gone to Sikasso !'de!
EXCL12.1.2. Cleft focus constructions in copular clauses
There are two items which can be focused in equative copular clauses, the
subject and the predicate nominal. Focus on the subject presents no peculiarities: the construction as described in the preceding section is used, with a
resumptive pronoun following the focused noun phrase to show that it has
been focused. Following is both an affirmative and a negative example,
taken from the same folktale:
(20) a. Mu u βγε \νύύ ηύηϊ.
you she be our mother.DEF
'It is you who are our mother.'
b. Mu ba
u jiye \νύύ ηύηϊ
mi.
you it.is.not she be our mother.DEF NEG
'It is not you who are our mother.'
When the focused item is the predicate nominal, however, there are complications. There are two types of cleft construction which focus the predicate nominal. One is used when the subject is a noun, a first or second person pronoun, or an emphatic or demonstrative pronoun. The other is used
when the subject is a simple anaphoric pronoun. The former case is the simpler. The focused item is moved to the front of the clause, just as in verbal
clauses. The subject, however, is postposed to a position after the copula.
The focused item is followed by a resumptive pronoun, just as if it were a476Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructionsfocused subject. It thus looks as if the subject and predicate nominal have
switched roles. Following are some examples:

this.yearWhen the subject is a simple anaphoric pronoun, a more complex construction is used. The focused predicate nominal is moved to the front and followed by a coreferential pronoun, as in the type just described. The subject,
however, is not merely postposed to the copula. It is placed after the copula
in a clause of its own, with a predicate consisting of an identifier pronoun
(see chapter 5, section 5.1.2.6) of the appropriate gender and number. This
extra ""subject clause"" is marked as subordinate by a high tone on the subject
pronoun, rather than the mid-low tune which it normally carries. The high
tone carries over onto the identifier pronoun, which becomes high-low. 7

Predicate nominals which occur in verbal clauses can also be focused, but
they do not cause any complications there. They are simply fronted as in
other clefts, and a gap is left following the verb in the presupposed clause:

'It was a hyena that he turned himself into (not, e.g. into a lion).'
12.1.3. The contrastive genitive construction
Contrastive focus on a genitive (possessor) noun phrase is indicated by placing a genitive particle u between the genitive and the head noun. This particle has weak mid tone, and behaves tonally as if it were a possessed noun,
becoming high after a mid tone, and low-weak mid after a low tone. It is
obviously related to the independent possessive pronoun root wu- (see
chapter 5, section 5.1.2.11). The head noun following the particle is completely unaffected tonally.
The following examples illustrate the use of u to indicate contrastive focus:8
(24) C:Nümüci sä ä

Realis complements of manipulative verbs, which take a high tone marking
on the subject pronoun when they are affirmative, lose this marking in the
negative, and are formed simply like negative declarative clauses. The construction is thus paratactic, with no morphological marks of subordination:

"510Chapter 13: Relative clauses13.4.3. Relative clauses modifying predicate nominate
Relative clauses which modify non-referential predicate nominals are remarkable for the fact that they are postposed to the main clause rather than
preposed, as all other relative clauses are. If they immediately follow the
noun they modify, which is usually the case since predicate nominals are
most often final in their clause, they have the appearance of being embedded. The relativized noun phrase is coded with a relative pronoun, which if it
is fronted occurs next to the predicate nominal, as if it were a determiner.
Following is an example:
(36) Fäägä pye känhä $k6-mü
ka
Farakala be village DEM-REL it
'Farakala is a village which
ρέέ
άόόηίλΊ

PERFke.
RELAs was shown in section 12.1.2 of chapter 12, a focused predicate nominal
is placed in focus position at the head of the clause. If a focused predicate
nominal is modified by a relative clause, the latter will be postposed to the
main clause and thus separated from the noun phrase it modifies in a way
similar to preposed relative clauses. In the following example, the predicate
nominal is focused, but the relativized noun phrase is not focused. Although
it is the predicate nominal which is placed in focus position, it seems to be
the information in the relative clause which is particularly highlighted.

The non-referential subject of an identificational clause (see chapter 7,

The relative clause construction described in the preceding sections is not
used to modify referential indefinite noun phrases (as in, e.g. Ά man I saw
yesterday just went into that store.') Instead, a claus? identical in form to a
realis (high tone) complement clause (see chapter 11, sections 11.3, 11.4.
11.7) is used. Such a clause consists of a pronoun subject with high tone,
followed by a perfect or progressive auxiliary. It is noteworthy that this
clause type can also be used as a simultaneous time adverbial clause (see
chapter 15, section 15.1.1.5).
The realis (high tone) complement is used with verbs of manipulation and
perception, whose direct objects are coreferential with the complement subject. It is this condition of coreferentiality that has allowed the development
of a further relative clause-like function in the absence of any complementtaking verb. So far this extended function has stuck close to its roots in only
being employed to modify direct objects. Compare the following example:
(39)Cedtji
wä
υ
nä
figämii

Ά certain woman gave birth to twinssi
give.birth.topi
ά
färä
pi-yd

they .COMP PERF be.stuck they-REFL at
which were stuck to each other.'
Even when a complement-taking verb is present, the best translation of a
realis complement is sometimes a relative clause in English. Following is
such an example:
(40)Camj kä
u mäha ...
tÄba-w6rjke
kä

see512Chapter 13: Relative clauses13.6. Negative relative clauses
All of the examples of relative clauses given hitherto in this chapter have
been affirmative. Negative relative clauses are also possible, though for
pragmatic reasons they are considerably less common. Non-participation in
an event is simply not very often a useful means of identifying a particular
participant. Only three unelicited negative relative clauses appear in the corpus. Speakers are not at all reluctant to produce them on demand, however.
Negative relative clauses differ from affirmative ones principally in the
substitution of the negative clause final marker mi for the relative clause
marker k6, and in the usual negative marking required by the particular
tense-aspect of the clause. In the following example, the non-fronted (and
non-referential) relativized noun phrase has the syntactic role of a genitive
(in the subject noun phrase) in the relative clause:
(41) IJgi-mü
wögii
pye a
wwü
mi,
DEF(G1S)-REL POSS(G3S) NEG PERF take.out NEG
'The one whose (teeth) have not been removed,
u pye ä
cipeere
pyi mi.
he NEG PERF marriage do NEG
he has not married.'
Freely: 'Anyone whose {teeth) have not been removed has not
married (yet).'
The relativized noun phrase in a negative relative may also be fronted. The
type of negative focus construction used is not the common sort with negation of the focused item followed by an affirmative presupposed clause ('it is
not X that did Y'), but rather the sort with the negation in the presupposed
clause ('it is X that didn't do Y'). For examples of these types see chapter
12, section 12.1.1. The most striking characteristic of this type of negative
cleft construction is the presence of the copula pye just after the focused
item (in affirmative clefts there is no such copula). Fronting the relativized
noun phrase requires the same construction. In the following example the
relativized noun phrase, which is a demonstrative pronoun only, is the subject of the relative clause.
(42) Mpif pi pye pi pye a

Freely: 'Ground Hornbill swallowed those that had not managed to
dig holes*13.7. The syntactic status of relative clauses
In section 11.7 of chapter 11 it was argued that complement clauses in
Supyire are neither fully embedded nor fully independent. The same observation can be made of relative clauses. As pointed out in section 13.1 above,
relative clauses are either preposed or postposed to the main clause. Just as
with complement clauses, there is no evidence that they were are some point
in the past normally embedded and owe their present position to a process of
""extraposition"". Instead, there is evidence that a process of embedding is beginning. A peculiar construction is sometimes used in connected discourse
which I will call ""semi-embedding"".
The relativized noun phrase of a semi-embedded relative clause must be
fronted in its clause. The noun plus modifying clause is placed in the main
clause in its normal position. So far the structure looks like an ordinary embedded relative clause in a language like English. However, after the relative
clause is completed, instead of simply continuing with the remaining portion
of the main clause, the speaker restarts the main clause from the beginning,
this time inserting a coreferential noun phrase in the place where the relative
clause was in the preceding unfinished clause. The construction is clearest
when the modified noun phrase is a direct object of the main clause:
(43) a. Kä pi ί

Freely: 'Then I went to the Catholic mission and asked for the
white man and his wife who came here (last year).'
When the modified noun is the subject of the main clause, it is usually impossible to tell if the relative clause is semi-embedded or not, since the subject comes first anyway. However, sometimes there is some element such as
a conjunction which precedes the subject. If the relative clause is semi-embedded, this conjunction precedes the relativized noun phrase at the beginning of the sentence (with a completely unembedded relative it would only
follow the relative clause). Note in the following example how the different
subject narrative conjunction kä is placed both before and after the relative
clause:
(44) Kä pyätji
ηύηί

'Then the child's mother who had died,

deeds.DEF ADJ-do.DEF beside
deeds.'
Freely: 'Then the child's mother who had died tired of the things
her co-wife was doing.'
""Semi-embedding"" as illustrated in the above examples cannot simply be
dismissed as ""performance"" errors. They are not examples of restarting a
sentence in midstream. Speakers do not regard them in any way as odd or inelegant, and willingly supply additional examples.
It appears, then, that this type of construction represents the beginning of a
process which may end in the full embedding of relative clauses. In the present state of the language, however, relative clauses are like the complement
clauses in being neither embedded nor independent. Like complement
clauses, they are marked as subordinate by a specific morpheme, in this case
the relative clause marker k6. Internally they are further marked by either
the fronting of the relativized noun phrase or the use of a relative pro-13.7. The syntactic status of relative clauses515noun/determiner. While these characteristics may be minor, they do show
that the relative clause cannot simply be analyzed as some sort of topic
clause adjoined by simple parataxis to another independent clause.","[532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538]"
"111concurrence of form cannot be merely a coincidence, but must be due to
a deep-seated similarity in meaning. In fact the ingredients noted in the
preceding discussion, viz. perfectivity, current (or ""lingering""; Givön
1984: 280) relevance, and anteriority are all characteristics which the
pluperfect shares with the simple perfect.

Fwdrdbä 'co-operative society' is borrowed from Bambara fdrdba,

As a main verb, ίέέ either takes a dative-experiencer subject with a patient indirect object ( = the thing the experiencer is accustomed to), or
the syntactic roles are reversed, with the patient as subject and the dative-experiencer as indirect object. The serial construction follows the
first configuration in having the dative-experiencer as subject. See
chapter 7, section 7.4.3.2 for examples.
Comrie calls these tenses ""combinations of absolute tenses"". In Supyire
they are not absolute, however, as the reference point can be in the past
or future, as will appear below.
The progressive marker here is a relic of the origin of the future auxiliary as an imperfective verb.
The low tone on sähä here is due to the spread of the floating low tone
following the subject, not to the negative auxiliary.
The term ""main line"" is used to denote independent clauses which encode the events of the narrative in their proper chronological order. It
thus excludes all clauses encoding background information, and all subordinate clauses.
In poetry the earlier form warf is attested.
Comrie (1986: 26-28, 61, 103) also doubts that the so-called ""sequential"" tenses actual code sequentiality. He claims that the sequentiality
can in most if not all cases be attributed to an ""implicature"", and that it
is not part of the meaning of the grammatical forms in question. There
can be no rigid dividing line between ""implicature"" and ""meaning"",
however, since in historical change yesterday's ""implicature"" often
becomes today's ""meaning"". Certainly if the speaker regularly intends
the hearer to draw a certain inference from a given grammatical form,
and in fact counts on that inference being drawn (i.e. it becomes a
""conventional implicature""), the stage is set for the inference to become
part of the ""meaning"" of the form. Since the narrative/sequential auxiliary in Supyire can only be used under certain well-defined conditions,
one of which is that the chronological sequence must be observed724Notes: Chapter 9(events can overlap or occasionally be simultaneous, but not out of order), it seems clear that the speaker intends the hearer to understand this
to be indicated by the use of the auxiliary.
36 See Carlson 1986 and chapter IS below for a description of the switchreference system of Supyire.
37. It looks very much like the perfect marker ä (this would explain the low
tone on the final vowel of AS/), but it is unclear how the meaning
(sequential with middle strength thematic continuity) could be derived
from a composition of the perfect with a non-finite form. It could be
that the original meaning of the perfect (possibly 'come', as noted
above) could have been at the origin of this construction.
38. The leaves referred to are dead leaves with which the yam mounds have
been covered in order to keep in moisture till the yams sprout.
39. The subject refers to a very old man who was incapable of walking. He
used to be brought outside and 'spread out' in the sun—the verb is the
one used for spreading out grain or cotton to dry. Cängke is 'sunlight'
or 'daylight', and is the common word for 'day' as well'.
40. The subject refers to a fish caught by the speaker. Supyire fishermen
are as prone to exaggeration as fishermen elsewhere.
41. C6g6imanner, way, means' is borrowed from Bambara cogo, with the
same meaning.
42. Occasionally one even hears [d] instead of [r] (or [s]). Since [r] is an
allophone of /d/ in unstressed medial syllables, it is not surprising that
some speakers, when for whatever reason they introduce a slight pause
just after the future auxiliary, interpret the [r] that normally appears
there as /d/.
43. To 'answer the yes' means to supply the interjections and murmers of
assent at the end of each breath group during a monologue by another
speaker. The speaker of this example is about to launch into a narrative,
and wants to make sure that someone is designated to 'answer the yes'.
44. This is evidence that the original form of the auxiliary was ba.
45. Jinä is borrowed (via Bambara) from Arabic jiimiy. In the Supyire cosmology it refers to tutelary spirits which inhabit streams.
46. The construction is rather similar in meaning to the French expression
Void que...
47. Although the perfect auxiliary is written separately in this construction,
for most speakers the vowel following the glottal stop is not in reality
long (/nähä ä/ becomes [nä?ä]). Note that the low tone of the perfect
auxiliary replaces the high on the final vowel of nähä.
48. Compare the similar construction with säJiä described in section 9.2.5
above.
49. The development from 'create' to 'reputed' probably went through
some such stage as 'imagine'. Compare the development of English fie-Notes: Chapter 9725tion from the past participle of the Latin verb fingere 'shape, fashion,
feign'.
50. Buwara was the first inhabitant of the region including Kampwo, according to legend. This speaker believes, though he is not certain, that
Buwara was a Samogo (a Mande-speaking people whose territory at
present divides the Supyire from the central Senufo groups) who came
from Kong, a city in northern C6te d'lvoire.
51. Ja is also used as a main verb in the common expression for 'thank
you': Mu a jä. Literally this means 'You have overcome.'
52. Following a high tone, mä is pronounced a step lower, as if it were mid
tone, due to downstep (see chapter 2, section 2.3.5.1). Since nothing follows in the clause (and the tone register is generally reset during the
pause following the m£), the terracing effect of the downstep is not felt.
To avoid encumbering the orthography with apostrophes, therefore, the
negative particle following a high tone is simply written as if it were
mid, i.e. me. The same practice is followed for other high tone clause final particles such as the relative clause marker k6 and the interrogative
marker be.
53. Coming at the edge of the clause as it does, this looks superficially like
evidence for the analysis of negation as it is treated in propositional calculus, as an operator on a proposition. The placement of negative marking at the periphery of a clause is extremely rare (see Dahl 1979), which
Horn (1989) takes to be good evidence that such an analysis is misguided. The value of the Senufo ""evidence"" is of course considerably
vitiated by the occurrence of negative marking in the auxiliary position
in most tense-aspects, a placement that is cross-linguistically common.
54. Pyenga 'compound, home' has a mid-low tune, the final low of which
floats and docks on the following negative marker.
55. Yatooro, literally 'things with legs', has the same mid-low tone tune as
pyenga referred to in the previous note.
56. Thus in spite of its consistent clause final negative marking, Supyire
also abides by the ""Neg First principle"" (Horn 1989: 449, quoting Jespersen) to the effect that negative marking is placed first or near the
beginning of the sentence in the interests of clearness. Without such
early marking, of course, the hearer would be unaware that the current
clause was negative until it was terminated.
57. Horn (1989: 190), picking up on a hint in Clark (1974), uses the term
suppose rather than presuppose to label this ""entertainment"" of the affirmative, which obviously does not qualify as presupposition in the
strict sense. As Giv<Sn (1989) points out, the information must be assumed to be backgrounded in order for the negative to be pragmatically
felicitous, and this same notion covers the other cases of the use of the
combination pye na.","[746, 747, 748]"
"Negative constituent questions are marked with the same negative interrogative clause final marker (/ni/i) as negative yes/no questions. However,
instead of replacing the positive marker, as in yes/no questions, the negative
marker is placed in front of the other interrogative particle. The set of nonparticipants in a specific event is of course infinite. This means that the
pragmatic situations in which a speaker would want information on the
identity of a specific non-participant are rather rare. It is often of practical
use to know why an event did not take place, however, and so negative reason questions like the following are not uncommon:

Q14.2.2.2.jö 'who, whom, whose'
Jö (or jö) is borrowed from Bambara jon 'who'. It is sometimes combined
with the Supyire root foo 'owner, person in charge' (see chapter 3, section
3.2.2.9), which takes a low tone in this context: jöfbö. The use of jö or jöfbd
indicates that the speaker believes the referent he or she is asking the identity of is a human being. Jö is accordingly treated as being gender 1 singular
for the purposes of agreement. Thus when it is the subject which is questioned, a gender 1 singular place-holding pronoun must immediately follow
the question word:

Jd, like all other pronouns in Supyire, is not marked for case in any way:
the same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and genitive:

"There are two clause initial yes/no question particles which are probably
etymologically related. The form tähä is the most common. The variant tone
tune tähä also occurs, and at least one instance of jähä has been recorded.
The other form, tä, is perhaps simply a shorter form of the same particle.
The variant kä has, however, been recorded in the speech of an old man
from Fanter61a. Following are examples of these two particles:

Negative yes/no questions can be formed in two ways. One is by means of
the clause final negative question marker mä, frequently reduced to a. Negative marking in the auxiliary position is added exactly as in a declarative:

"9.4.1. The marking of negationIn most ΤΑΜ categories negation is doubly marked in the clause. A clause
final negative particle is obligatory. It is in most tense-aspects supplemented
by a marking in the auxiliary position, i.e. immediately following the subject. This kind of double marking is widespread in central and northern
Senufo languages. In most cases it is not clear what the etymology of the
negative markers is, so it is difficult at this point to say whether the double
marking arose from a reinforcing strategy (with the clause final marking
being added to reinforce the earlier auxiliary strategy) or from some other
source. Whatever the etymological source of the clause final markers, they
are not derived from direct objects in the manner of French pas or English
not, since they come in the wrong position in the clause for that. The most
likely source would be some sort of adverb.",[399]
"The absence of any copula in the affirmative, and the absence of any
relative clause morphology or syntax, makes the ""cleft"" look very much
like Y-movement. The construction seems in fact to cover the pragmatic
functions of both clefts and Y-movement (i.e. both strong and somewhat
weaker contrast). I have chosen to label it cleft because of the use of a
copular element in the negative, and because of the use of a place-holding pronoun when the subject is focused. As pointed out by Givön
(1990, chapter 16), in a subject initial language (like English or Supyire) a true Y-movement construction should not be able to code focus on
the subject, since it is already in initial position.
On the face of it this contradicts some predictions based on the
""accessibility hierarchy"" (see Keenan and Comrie 1977, Keenan 1985).
Pronoun retention is typically lower on the hierarchy than gapping.
Supyire is thus unusual in using pronoun retention with subject, which
is the highest point on the hierarchy, and gapping with direct object,
which is lower. Because of the peculiar word order of the Senufo lan-Notes: Chapter 123.","[753, 754]"
"Three verbs of cognition introduced in the preceding section can take conditional complements when the main clause is negative. In each case the use
of a conditional indicates less certainty than the use of an ordinary na-complement. Compare the following examples with the verb dä 'believe'. With a
conditional complement, it is closer to 'doubt' than to 'not believe'.

'not think':

if
they FUT it begin cinq.heures.et.demi.DEF at NEG
if they will start it at 5:30.'
It should be noted that some speakers refuse to use sentences of this sort.
The third verb of cognition which can take conditional complements is ce
'know'. Since ce is factive, the truth of an ordinary zia-complement is not affected by the negation of the main clause. It is only through the use of a
conditional complement that this presupposition of the truth of the complement can be dispensed with. Compare the following examples:456
(74)Chapter 11: Complemen t cla uses
a. UpyeacdnaΡγέέίέsim-pämi.she NEG PERF know that Pierre FUT FP-come NEG
'She doesn't know that Pierre is coming.*
b. UpyeacdämpyiPyiirdsiih-pämi.she NEG PERF know if
Pierre FUT FP-come NEG
'She doesn't know if Pierre is coming/
This means of circumventing the factivity of ce is available even when it
does not fall under the scope of negation. Thus ce can take a conditional
complement clause when it is affirmative if the speaker is not sure or does
not wish to appear sure of the truth of the complement. The following example illustrates:
(75)Miisa acdämpyiZhän äpa.","[478, 479]"
"The etymology of mi is uncertain, but it is possibly related to the locative
adverb m i ' o v e r there'. It is identical in form with the clause final marker
for a type of comparative clause initiated with the conjunction bk and terminated by m i ( s e e chapter 15, section IS.1.4). This seems to point to an origin
as some sort of reinforcer.
Mi combines with the clause final politeness marker yö (see chapter 5,
section 5.10) to yield m6 (sometimes pronounced [mbö]):
(150)Yi fly ε ä

aha
a
törö
they NEG PERF be.much SC pass

NEG.POLThe other major clause final negative marker, mä, is used principally in
questions. The initial [m] frequently elides if the metrical conditions are
right, but this is not obligatory. For yes/no questions, the ordinary question
marker la is simply replaced by mä, and the result is a negative yes/no question. Such negative questions are almost always rhetorical in force, and are
strongly biased towards a positive response, just as negative questions are in
English:

"As pointed out in chapter 7, section 7.2, identificational clauses (i.e.
clauses with an identifier pronoun as predicate) are negated by substituting
the negative identifier bä for the identifier pronoun. Bä thus means 'it is not
a X' or 'they are not X'. It is followed directly by the clause final negative
particle mä.
(174)Mu

"The scope ofnegationSupyire is like other languages (cf. Giv6n 1984: 324) in that only asserted
information in a clause normally falls under the scope of negation. Presupposed information, in particular definite subjects (at least in verbal clauses),
remain outside the scope of negation. Adverbs and indirect objects tend to
arrogate the negation to themselves. Thus
(177)PipyeaIi pyisipcyanmi.they NEG PERFit do together NEG
'They didn't do it together.'
does not deny that they did it, but only that they did it together. Similarly,
(178)U siζίηίbag6pwbg6nami.he NEG.FUT FP.Iie.down house.DEF mouth.DEF at NEG
'He will not lie down at the door of the house.'
does not deny that he will lie down. ""Adverbial"" serial verbs also attract the
negation to themselves. Thus
(179)Zäntünrjbpyenan-tiliäyaagacQmi.hyena
NEG PROG IP-be.straight SC thing catch NEG
'Hyena does not catch anything straightaway.'
does not imply that Hyena does not catch anything, but only that he doesn't
do it directly, without first carefully circling it.
Indefinite nouns in the scope of negation must be non-referential (cf.
Giv6n 1984: 331). In the last example above the indefinite noun yaaga
'thing' was translated as if it were a quantifier. In fact, yaaga is used in this
way in negative sentences much more frequently than the quantifier yafytn
described in the previous section. Indefinite pronouns under the scope of negation must likewise be non-referential:(180) Mpipyeawäόnutdmi.hare NEG PERF IND GEN mother bury NEG
'Hare hasn't (helped) bury anyone's mother.'
Subjects are not invariably outside the scope of negation. In fact, indefinite
subjects normally fall within its scope and are non-referential. Thus388Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negation(181)Wäjiyeäpami.","[410, 411]"
"This sentence was occasioned by a child asking what my binoculars
were. When I explained that I used them to watch birds, a bystander uttered the sentence.
If the identificational pronouns arose from the conflation of a pronoun
with a copula, it is likely that the present-day subject of an identificational clause began its career as a predicate nominal fronted for focus.
In the absence of comparative reconstruction, this remains speculation.
This particle seems to be related to the postposition bää 'without'. Historically, this postposition had the form bälV, and is most likely derived
from the Bambara/Jula verb/postposition bali 'prevent from, without'
(though the tone is high whereas the Supyire postposition has a low-mid
weak tune). The hypothesis that bä is derived from bää is considerably
strengthened by the observation that when the negative question particle
mä is added, bä becomes bälä, the [m] of mä eliding and [1] of bää appearing just as one would expect according to the rule which avoids sequences of three vowels if possible. An example of this is:714Notes: Chapter 7

"9.4. Negation
9.4.3. Negation in complex389sentencesThere is room here only for a brief survey of this large and complicated
topic. A disproportionate amount of space will be allotted to negation in
sentences with complement clauses, where the phenomenon of 'Neg-raising'
is of interest.
Certain types of subordinate clause are not amenable to negation. In particular, no unelicited examples of a negative time adverbial clause with past
time reference occur in the corpus. I was able only with the greatest difficulty to persuade a speaker to produce one, and it is better left unrecorded.
There are of course good pragmatic reasons for this lack (cf. Givön
1984: 348): the function of a time clause is to provide, through reference to
some known (or at least predictable) event, a setting for some other event. In
general, non-events simply aren't of sufficient saliency to provide this setting.
Negative restrictive relative clauses are rare for the same reason (Givön
1984: 349): participation in a non-event or non-state does not usually have
the saliency to provide adequate identification. If the context is right, however, negative relative clauses are possible. They have two peculiarities
which set them apart from other relative clauses. The first and most obvious
is that the final relative clause marker k6 is replaced with the clause final
negative marker miI65 The second is not obligatory, but is very common. It
applies in general only to relativized subjects, and consists in the placement
of the copula ρ y e after the resumptive subject pronoun, and then the repetition of that pronoun followed by the rest of the clause, including, if applicable, negative marking in the auxiliary position. Note that restrictive relative
clauses are preposed to the main clause, and the mi is placed at the end of
the relative clause, before the main clause. The following example, in which
the subject noun phrase is relativized, shows how a non-event in the relative
clause is rendered salient by the immediately preceding context:
(185)Kä pi)siwylgiiwwüfangkie,and IND(GIP) NARR holes take.off grave.DEF in
'Some of them ( = the frogs) dug holes in (the side of) the grave
maaTjw5ho ciree.","[411, 412]"
"735positive counterpart ('Monkey is well') rather than the confirmation of
the negative. Note that the English translation 'Isn't Monkey well?' is
biased towards a positive response, whereas the translation used in the
example is not as obviously so biased. There is nothing in the form of
the Supyire corresponding to this difference in English.
In the Supyire culture, the 'chiefs of the earth' are different from chiefs
of villages. The former have a certain spiritual jurisdiction over the
land, but do not actually dispose of it, nor do they have any jurisdiction
over people.
Recall that bi without a question word forms a yes/no question (see
section 14.2.1.1 above).
The reference is to undoing a curse on the land due to a taboo being
broken.
L f r / ' h o u r , time' is borrowed from French l'heure 'the hour'.
Wyere literally means 'leaves'. See chapter 12, note 4.
There are of course sometimes ways of rephrasing the sentence to exclude the use of a serial construction. With the present example the adpositional marking of instrument case role can be used instead of the serial verb marking, and then the direct object of the main verb can be
questioned without difficulty:

"12.1.1. The cleft focusconstructionThe "" c l e f t "" construction in Supyire differs from the construction so labeled
in other languages (e.g. English) in that it has none of the specific trappings
of relative clause syntax, and does not appear to be derived from it in any
way. Indeed, as will be shown in chapter 13, the influence seems to have
been in the opposite direction. The label is justified on two grounds, however. Firstly, the function of the Supyire construction approximates that of
clefts in other languages. Secondly, the Supyire construction shares certain
syntactic characteristics with clefts in other languages, characteristics quite
separate from anything specifically related to relative clauses.
The cleft in Supyire, like that in other languages, functions primarily to
code strong focus on one item in the proposition. As noted in the preceding
section, a speaker may choose to put an item of information under strong focus for a variety of reasons. The focused item may or may not be new information, but the ""out of focus"" part of the construction is typically presupposed (in a pragmatic if not strictly logical sense).
From the coding point of view, the Supyire cleft is like other clefts in the
following ways: the focused noun phrase is placed first, followed, without a
pause, by the rest of the clause containing the presupposed information. The
focused item receives heavy stress, and the rest of the clause is correspondingly relatively unstressed. In the affirmative, no copula or other verbal element marks the focused noun phrase: 1
(1) Sig6
e υ
a
kard.
bush.DEF to s/he PERF go
'It is to the bush that s/he has gone.'
In the negative, the negative identifier bä 'it is not' is placed after the focused noun phrase.
(2) Sig6
e bä
u
a
Jcärd mi.
bush.DEF to it.it.not s/he PERF go
NEG
'It isn't to the bush that s/he has gone.'
The three elements of fronting the focused item, heavy intonational stress
on the focused item, and use of a quasi-copula (at least in the negative) are
all elements shared by typical clefts cross-linguistically. The absence of any
relative clause morphology and syntax (specifically the absence of relative12.1. Focus constructions469pronouns and of the clause final relative marker) is typical of strong focus
constructions in West African languages (see Creissels 1978 for a survey of
twenty languages).
The presupposed, ""out of focus"" clause which follows the focused item is
not marked in any special way in Supyire with one exception. If the tenseaspect is present progressive (with the auxiliary na), the copula pye is inserted before the auxiliary:
(3) Na
mu /
m)i pye na
yu.
with you with I
be PROG speak.IMPFV
'It is with you that I ' m speaking.'
This admittedly restricted marking of the presupposed part of the proposition
is also found in questions and relative clauses, and forms part of the marking
of negation in progressive clauses (see chapter 9, section 9.4.1.2).
When word order is exploited for pragmatic purposes, its function of coding syntactic roles is disrupted. The cleft construction thus creates a ""caserecoverability"" problem: how does the speaker let the addressee know what
the syntactic case role of the focused item is? With a focused direct object, a
simple gap is used. If the verb is transitive, the absence of a direct object between the tense-aspect auxiliary and the verb is a clue to the hearer that this
is where the focused item belongs. Note that when the direct object is removed from its normal position, the intransitive prefix appears on the verb.

IP-call bogoWhen the focused item is the subject, it is immediately followed by a
coreferential anaphoric pronoun. Without this pronoun, the focus construction would be morphologically indistinguishable from an ordinary clause,
since the subject normally comes first in such clauses. The strong stress on
the subject would of course provide an intonational clue, but this is evidently
not sufficient. The pronoun, which like ordinary subjects is unstressed, is an
unmistakable indication that the construction is marked for focus. 2 When the
focused item is a first or second person pronoun, the resumptive pronoun is
third person, gender 1. In the following examples, context has been included
where possible to get a feel for the nature of the focus involved.","[491, 492]"

Introduction
1.1. The people
The Supyire language is spoken by the Supyire people. The noun süpyfrä, in
effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the people'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"9.4.1.1. Clause final negative marking
There are two clause final negative particles, each of which has more than
one form. The particle used in ordinary declarative clauses is mä. 52 It is al·
ways placed at the very end of the clause, after any indirect objects or adverbs which follow the verb: 53
(148)a. Ka-pdgiisähäßyenayuaffair-bad.DEF STILL NEG PROG say.IMPFV
'Bad deeds are no longer told
pyiibfijiyi) nä mä.children.DEF eye at NEG
to the children. 1 (i.e. children are no longer taught what is
bad)9.4. Negation377b. Cydebii

jä
ä
women.DEF NEG PERF be.able SC
'The women were not able
jähämä
pyi ' sähärjk) mi.
funeral.dance do

NEG
to do the funeral dance again.'
If the negative marker immediately follows a noun unaccompanied by a
postposition (such as a noun used adverbially as in example (149a) below, or
a predicate nominal as in (149b), it may allow a low tone originating with
the noun to dock, and thus become mi:
(149)a. Mit si
sä y)

Ί will not go and tell it (lit. them) (at) home.' 5 4
b. Ti
mpyi yatooro55

'They were not domestic animals.'","[399, 400]"
"One example with the conditional has been recorded:
(83)U sähä ' gä ' nurä
ä
pä
sbnrjä
he AGAIN COND return SC come think
' I f he thinks again (of something more)...'ä
ta
yö...
SC get POL9.2. Tense347Note in the two last examples that the notion of 'again' is coded elsewhere
in the clause (the adverb sähägk) and the serial verb ηύτύ 'return', 'V2
again') in addition to the 'again' auxiliary. These other means of coding are
much more common (by themselves) than is the use of the 'again' tense.
The 'no longer' tense is the negation of the 'still' tense. Its basic function
is to indicate that a durative event which was occurring in the past is not occurring in the present (or a state which obtained in the past no longer obtains). Pragmatically, the fact that the past state of affairs no longer obtains
is contrary to expectation. As will be shown in section 9.4 below, negative
auxiliaries are of two sorts. In most tense-aspects the negative ""auxiliary"" is
a low tone which appears on the ΤΑΜ auxiliary. In other tense-aspects the
copula ßye precedes the auxiliary. In the 'no longer' tense, the negative
auxiliary follows the 'still' auxiliary. With a copula, the negative auxiliary is
a low tone which docks to the left onto the final vowel of sahä:
(84) Ml) sahä
ßye lire
e me.
I
STILL.NEG be it(EMPH) in NEG
Ί am no longer in it ( = the draft).'
With a verb, the progressive auxiliary is used, and this is preceded by its
normal negative auxiliary, the copula ßye:
(85) Pylibii
sahä32 ßye
na
byif
children.DEF STILL NEG PROG raise
'Children are no longer raised
pi
taßjää
byi-rjkani
na mi.
their yesterday raise-manner.DEF on NEG
as they were in the past (lit. on their yesterday's manner of being
raised).'
As might be expected, the corresponding negation of the 'again' tense
means 'not again' or 'not anymore'. The normal negative auxiliary ßye is
used with the perfect auxiliary:
(86)Wä sahä
ßye
a
bwbn 1) nä me.
IND AGAIN NEG PERF hit
it on NEG
'None touched it again.' lit. 'One did not again touch it.'","[369, 370]"
"9.3. Modality371The imperative and subjunctive forms described above are used in the affirmative only. There is only one negative corresponding to all three. I have
chosen to call it the ""prohibitive"", but it could just as easily be labeled the
""negative subjunctive"". The auxiliary is kä, which looks very much like the
negative form of the conditional auxiliary kd, and in fact has similar allomorphs: ahi [a?&] or hä [?ä] after pronouns, gk [Ra] after most stressed
vowels. It differs from the conditional, however, in taking the future prefix
on a following verb, rather than the intransitive prefix which follows most
auxiliaries. Although they may have the same tone (since the conditional
may accept a floating low tone from the preceding subject) the conditional
and the prohibitive are easily distinguished since the latter always occurs in
a negative clause (signalled by the clause-final negative marker) whereas the
former never does. The following example illustrates this:
(135) IJkää cyäge
e uru
si
sä ύ kyä g6,
but place.DEF in he(EMPH)FUT go her eat REL
'But the place in which he will go eat her,
uru
kä
flüyke
yirlgö,
he(EMPH) COND head.DEF raise
when he raises his head,
uru
kä
k/Je pye mi.
he(EMPH) PROH sky see NEG
he must not see the sky.'
The imperfective of the prohibitive is formed by adding the imperfective
subjunctive auxiliary a:
(136) Ma
hä
a
Käräja
you.NONDECL PROH SUBJUNC.IMPFV Karaja
cyera
ä
de!
insult.IMPFV NEG EXCL
'Don't insult Karaja!'
9.3.4. Ability
The modality of ability is coded by means of serial verb constructions. The
principal verb used in this way is ja, which as a main verb means 'overcome,
defeat', 51 as in the following example:372Chapter 9: Aspect, tease, modality, and negation(137)Ckmjk6shwd-shähänaämu jä'day.DEF millet-basket.DEF PERF you overcome
'The day the basket of millet overcame you (i.e. was too heavy

can it get hot?'
The imperfective form of ja (jinä) seems to be developing an auxiliary use,
albeit in a restricted context. It can be used in generic habitual contexts
without any preceding auxiliary, and with the following verb in perfective
rather than imperfective form. It takes a low tone negative marking, just as
do other high tone auxiliaries. Following is an example of this use in a proverb:
(139)WäjinaafaänijäIND NEG.be.able.IMPFV SC cloth
'One can't weave cloth
fäändi bää

without a shuttle.'einweave9.3. Modality373As frequently happens cross-linguistically with the modality of ability,
there are signs that this construction is being extended to cover permission.

mk?
with you.PL with NEG.QThe verb ta 'get, find' is used to code success. As VI in a serial construction, it means 'succeed in V2ing', or 'manage to V2'. The direct object of
V2 is usually placed before ta:
(141)Zhibannaywo
mpii pi
pye pi

'Ground Hornbill swallowed those which

"Although the etymology of mä is not known, internal evidence shows that
it has been shortened in clause final position. When it appears in negative
constituent questions, it is no longer final, but is placed before the interrogative marker ye. In this position its vowel is usually long:
(153) Jlähä πά mu si
zhyi
nigisüiji
na
what on you FUT FP.go bicycle.DEF on
'Why don't you go on bicycle?'mää
NEG.Qye?
QIf the [m] elides, however, the vowel is short:
(154) ßähä kaa
ύ
tä u sähä
wä
ta ä
what it PERF him get he NEG.YET IND get SC
'What has prevented (lit. gotten) him (so that) he has not yet
managed to
yaha u-yd
tännä a
ye?
leave he-REFL beside NEG.Q Q
save any (lit. leave some beside himself)?'
It should be pointed out that negative constituent questions appear to be
rather rarely used: the two just cited are the only unelicited ones occurring
in the corpus. By contrast, negative yes/no questions are relatively common:
nearly 150 unelicited examples appear in the corpus.
Although mä used alone seems to currently carry interrogative meaning, it
is evident that it originally did not do so: when it occurs with the exclamative marker de, there is no trace of interrogative function. Rather, the combination serves as an emphatic negator. In the great majority of cases, the [m]
of mä is elided:9.4. Negation

"574Chapter 15: IntercJausal connectionsIS. 1.5.3. Negative conditionals
As mentioned in the previous section, the conditional auxiliary ki is incompatible with most other auxiliaries. Among those it cannot co-occur with are
those marking negation (either ρye or low tone). All three of the alternate
ways of marking conditionals can be used with negatives:
(61) a. with ni'W
Νά ' wyiri pye ä
ta mii cy6 6 me,
if
money NEG PERF find my hand in NEG
'If I don't have money,
mii si
kü shwb mi.
I
NEG.FUT it buy NEG
I won't buy it.'
b. with a two-clause construction
Wyiri ' kä
ιή-pyi u pye ä
ta mii cy6 6 me
money COND IP-be it NEG PERF find my hand in NEG
'If I don't have money,...'
c. withkämpyf'irKdmpyf ' wyiri pye ά
ta mii cy6 6 me...
if
money NEG PERF find my hand in NEG
'If I don't have money...'
Following is an example with future tense, which takes the low tone negative marking on the auxiliary:
(62) Ampyi mu rf
si
ß-jä
ή-ίέέη
if
you ADV NEG.FUT FP.be.able FP-sit
'But if you won't be able to stay

mi
go PROG it wait.for.IMPFV NEG
(and) wait for it ( = my pay),
ma
rä
ä
wä.
you.NONDECL SUBJUNC SUBJUNC.IMPFV go
leave.'
A negative conditional meaning can also be obtained by using a f6 clause.
As a preposition, in addition to meaning 'till', /if can mean 'except for' when
the noun it marks is followed by the exclusive quantifiers känä 'only' or ye
'only* (see chapter 6, section 6.3.3.2):15.1. Adverbial clauses 575

ä
yaaga ta
I
NEG.be.here PERF thing find
Ί haven't found a thingmi
NEGίό
s))gkomb)}gd känä.
except cane
only
except a cane.'
This same 'except for' meaning is obtained when ίό is used to introduce a
negative clause. In effect such a clause gives a negative condition: 'if not' or
'unless'. Following is an example with a negative identifier clause:
(64)Wä βγε
a
sä a
cd, ίό
kile bä

IND NEG PERF go SC know except God it.is.not NEG
'No one knows except/if not God.'","[596, 597, 598]"

9.3.6*IP = intransitive prefix; FP = future prefixSupyire has many of the categories typically encountered cross-linguistically. In the area of aspect, which will be treated first, the basic distinction
between perfective and imperfective is marked on the verb (9.1.1). Progressive (9.1.2) and habitual (9.1.3) are coded by auxiliaries. Other aspectual
distinctions, such as inceptive (9.1.5), and terminative (9.1.6) are coded by
means of serial verbs. Apart from the progressive, durativity is expressed
through a variety of means including serial verbs, repetition, and adverbs
(9.1.4).
In the area of tense Supyire makes the common distinctions between past
(9.2.2), present (9.2.1), future (9.2.3), and perfect (9.2.4). There is a remoteness distinction in the past, between ""earlier today' and 'yesterday and ear-9.1. Aspect309Her'. Remoteness in the future is confounded with the epistemic modality of
reduced certainty. As in many other African languages, there is a special
coding for events in a sequence, which will be called ""narrative"" and
""sequential"" depending on its specific function (9.2.6). Also in common with
many Niger-Congo languages, there is a ""still"" or ""yet"" tense (9.2.5).
Numerous combinations of tenses and aspects are possible. Combinations
with past yield the past perfect, past progressive, past habitual, future in the
past, and the past ""still"" (9.2.7.1). Progressive aspect also combines with future, sequential/narrative, and the ""still"" tense (9.2.7.2).
In the area of modality, the basic distinction is between realis and irrealis
(9.3.1). The various auxiliaries can all be classified into these two categories. Crosscutting this distinction is the realm of epistemic modality. Copular
auxiliaries are used to code increased certainty (9.3.2.1). Reduced certainty
with irrealis modality is coded by means of a special auxiliary which also
can encode temporal remoteness. There is also a difference in the level of
certainty between the various future markers. Reduced certainty in realis
contexts is less grammaticalized. It can be indicated by means of adverbs
and serial verbs (9.3.2.2).
The modality of obligation will be touched on only briefly in this chapter
(9.3.3), since the subjects covered (imperative, subjunctive, hortative, and
prohibitive) will be dealt with in more detail in chapter 14 on non-declarative speech acts. Brief sections on the modalities of ability (9.3.4) and purpose (9.3.5) follow.
The section on modality in subordinate clauses (9.3.6) is likewise brief,
since the topics covered are described in detail in chapters 11 and 15.
The chapter concludes with a section on negation (9.4). Negation is encoded in two positions in the sentence. In most of the ΤΑΜ categories, there
is some marking in the auxiliary position, either the addition of a copular
auxiliary, or a tonal marking on the auxiliary already there. In addition, negation is marked sentence finally with a negative particle.
9.1. A s p e c t9.1.1. Perfective versus imperfective
The distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect is basic to the
Supyire ΤΑΜ system. As shown above in chapter 4, section 4.2, the great
majority of verbs have, in addition to the unmarked base form, an imperfective form derived principally through suffixation. In every use of a verb one
or the other of these forms must be chosen. The distinction thus crosscuts all
other ΤΑΜ categories. Most ΤΑΜ auxiliaries require one form and disallow
the other (unless another auxiliary is added). Those that take the base form
of the verb, such as the perfect auxiliary ä are more numerous than those310Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negationthat require the imperfective form of the verb, such as the progressive auxiliary na. In fact, there are only three auxiliaries in the latter class. There is
only one auxiliary which can take either form: mäha, which has the two distinct functions of marking habitual and past.
The imperfective form of the verb is properly so-called because it indicates that the event is construed without a terminal boundary (see Givön
1984: 276). The two major functional reasons for so construing an event are
to code durativity and to indicate simultaneity with some other event. The
commonest use of the imperfective verb form is in the progressive, which
encodes ongoing, durative action. In combination with past, future, and sequential/narrative, the progressive frequently is used to show simultaneity.
The imperfective is incompatible with a stative interpretation. As pointed
out in chapter 7, many stative verbs do have imperfective forms, but these
always have a dynamic reading of entry into the state. The dynamic use of
most stative verbs is extremely rare, but speakers consulted usually showed
no reluctance to produce imperfective forms for such verbs.
The unmarked, base form of the verb, by contrast with the marked imperfective form, can be labeled ""perfective"" as long as this is understood to be
mostly a default characterization (see Dahl 1985: 19 for the notion of default
category).
The use of the imperfective to code durativity can be briefly illustrated
with the imperative. The ""bare"" (and relatively impolite) imperative, which
takes no auxiliary, requires the perfective, or base form of the verb, as in the
following example.
(1) Νίέ kyaäre
kwbn.
this meat.DEF cut
'Cut this meat.'
This form would be used if the quantity of meat to be cut was small and the
action could therefore be quickly completed. The imperfective imperative
(marked with the auxiliary ta)y as in
(2) Ta
ήίέ kyaäre
kwüün.
IMPER.IMPFV this meat.DEF cut.IMPFV
'Cut this meat.'
would be used if there was a lot of meat to cut and the task would therefore
last a long time. Similarly the perfective
(3) Na
w)l
me.NONDECL look.at
'Look at me.'","[331, 332, 333]"
"Just as with the negative clause final particle mi (to which it may be related etymologically), bä has an alternate form bää. This is used when
bä/bää is followed by mä, in which case the [m] of mä almost always elides:
(175)Mpi bälä
ä?
hare it.is.not NEG.Q
'Isn't it Hare?'",[409]
"14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions
Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the question words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occasionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and emphatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]
"6.1. Determiners1956.1.2.1. Indefinite/partitive and indefinite 'other'
Like all the other determiners, the indefinite determiners (for the forms, see
chapter 5, section 5.1.2.4) normally require a definite head noun. The noun
phrase as a whole, however, is indefinite.
(12) a. pücwd-rjiwägirl-DEF(GlS) IND(GIS)
'a (certain) girl'
b. cyde-biipi)women-DEF(G 1P)IND(G 1P)
'some women'
c. ku-nilaroad-DEF(G3S) IND(G3S)
'a (certain) road'
d. kya-ä-retächew-G4-DEF(G4) IND(G4)
'some meat'
It could well be asked why such a complex form is needed when the noun
in its indefinite form (i.e. with the basic gender suffix only) would do as
well. The answer lies in the domain of referentiality. Simple indefinite nouns
can be either referential or non-referential. In the former case, they are often
of low discourse topicality. The more complex construction with an indefinite determiner, when used in a non-partitive sense in an affirmative clause,
is referential, and moreover, participants introduced in this way tend to be
highly topical. One can therefore say that the simple noun is often non-referential from a pragmatic point of view, and that one major function of the indefinite determiner is to code referential indefinites of importance in the discourse. The indefinite determiner or pronoun basically instructs the hearer
not to search the environment or the preceding discourse for a referent, but
rather to store the information for future reference.
The indefinite determiner may also be used with partitive meaning. In this
case the determiner does not need to agree in number with the head, but only
in gender. That is, a singular determiner may follow a plural head, as in the
following examples:
(13) a .picien-bifwätheir younger.siblings-DEF(GIP)IND(GIS)
'one of their younger siblings'
b. wüu wä
we
IND(GIS)
'one of us'196Chapter 6: Noun phrasesAs the latter example shows, the head of an indefinite determiner may be a
pronoun. Some examples with third person pronoun heads are:
(14) a. Kä u ύ
1j-kär6
and he NARR IP-go
'Then he went
mäsäkwü
kbb-g6
k&
e,

b. Mbdömbää-yimäha käri-gii
punf
discord-DEF HAB things-DEF(G3P) all
'Discord does all (sorts of) things,pyi,
do$kää Ii
lä
/Jye ηϊβοεηηε me.
but
it(G3S) IND(G3S) be good.G3S NEG
but not one (of them) is good/
The last example above illustrates a further point that should be made. In
most cases in affirmative, realis clauses, the noun phrase containing an indefinite determiner is referential, but this is not the case in negative and irrealis clauses, where such a noun phrase usually must be understood to be
non-referential.
As stated above, the head noun ordinarily takes the definite suffix even
with the indefinite determiner. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule
however, in which the head noun is indefinite. One is the common time
phrase cant) kä 'one day 1 , much used in narratives. The more regular cängke
kä is possible, but rarely heard. Another exception is found in the subject of
an exclamatory clause with a deictic identifier pronoun as predicate. In some
cases this seems to have a slightly pejorative force, as in the following example:
(15) Pyä wä
wdf
child IND(GIS) it.is(GlS)
'What a (troublesome) child! (lit. Here's a child!)'
It should be noted that the ambiguity occasioned by the dual function pronoun/determiner together with the similar word order of genitive and prehead determiner is naturally absent for post-head determiners. When these
occur before a noun, they must be interpreted as (genitive) pronouns. The
head (possessed) noun in this case must be in the indefinite form:6.1. Determiners19 7(16) a. wä
pyä
IND(GIS) child
'someone's child*
b. wä
jwü-mü
IND(GIS) say-G5
'someone's words'
Of course a head noun plus indefinite determiner may be a genitive noun
phrase, in which case the determiner is sandwiched between the nouns. The
possessed noun must still be indefinite:
(17) a. nä-gi
wä
man-DEF(GlS)
'a (certain) man's wife'cwd
IND(GIS)wifeb. ced-i7/
wä
ba-ga
woman-DEF(G 1S) IND(G 1S) house-G2S
'a (certain) woman's house'
The indefinite 'other' determiners (see chapter 5, section 5.1.2.5 for the
forms) differ from the indefinite determiners/pronouns in having antecedents
of sorts, perhaps better described as ""alterantecedents"". That is, the indefinite 'other* means ""another of the category mentioned before"". For example,
when one woman has already been mentioned, another may be introduced
with the phrase:
(18) ced-qi
wä-bire
woman-DEF(G 1 S)IND(G 1 S)-OTHER
'another woman'
Examples from other genders are:
(19) a. mobili-ge
kä-biri
car-DEF(G2S) IND(G2S)-OTHER
'another truck'
b. yacS-ni
lä-beri
belly-DEF(G3S) IND(G3S)-OTHER
'another pregnancy'
c. käri-gif
cO-bäri
affairs-DEF(G3P) IND(G3P)-OTHER
'other affairs'
Like the simple indefinites, the indefinite 'other' forms can be used as pronouns. In the following example, the ""alterantecedent"" is in the same sentence:198Chapter 6: Noun phrases(20) Mpiasiyiri kurucyä-gechare HAB.SEQ rise that(EMPH.G2S)place-DEF(G2S) at
'Hare would get up from that place
mäha sä gw0hokä-berdc.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221]"
"7.3. CopuJar clauses241The deictic identifier pronouns have the meaning 'Here/There is X.'
(10) Ku
kd.
it(G2S) here.is(G2S)
'Here/There it is.'
None of the identifier pronouns may occur in a negative clause. Instead,
they are all replaced with the negative identifier bä 'it's not (a/the) X.' 3
There is thus no agreement between subject and predicate in negative
clauses. Some examples are:
(11) a. Senufo mi-gibäme.","[263, 264]"
"12.1. Focus constructions
In Supyire, as in many languages, it is possible to distinguish two major
types of focus, which we will label ""weak"" and ""strong"" focus (cf. de Vries
1985). These labels are far from satisfactory, but in view of the terminological confusion in this area, it is best to avoid more specific terms which
might be misleading. If fact what we are here calling ""weak"" focus is often
termed the ""focus of assertion"". It is that part of a proposition which attracts the scope of negation (see chapter 9, section 9.4.2) and, in the corresponding yes/no question, it also attracts the scope of interrogation (see
chapter 14, section 14.2.1.3). Quantifiers and adjectives also typically fall
under the scope of weak focus (see chapter 6, sections 6.3.3 and 6.4). In a
declarative sentence, the information which falls under the scope of weak
focus is frequently, but not necessarily, new. It is typically asserted against
the background of the hearer's presumed ignorance.
In this section we will examine the most common devices used in Supyire
to encode strong focus. Strong focus is used in a number of pragmatic situations in which the speaker desires to draw particular attention to one noun
phrase (or to an adverb). It includes, for example, what is often called
""contrastive"" focus, when the speaker wishes to indicate one out of two or
more possibilities. It is also covers situations when a speaker has good reason to believe that the hearer might possibly be mistaken, or is in danger of
