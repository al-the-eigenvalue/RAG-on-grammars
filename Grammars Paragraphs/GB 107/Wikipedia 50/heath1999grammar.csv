"9.3.4 Equivalents of negative polarity items
KCh does not appear to have any lexical items that are used exclusively as negative
polarity items in the fashion of English (not) any, (not) ever, (not) a red cent, etc. (but
cf. §5.4.7). The forms that can be used to translate such English expressions are also
used in ordinary positive contexts. The main ones are listed in (475).

3SgO
Ί ate the electric fish, without cooking (=having cooked) it.'
Since bilaa 'without' is intrinsically negative, it is reasonable to connect this use
of the subjunctive with those described in the following section.
An alternative way of expressing 'X, without Y' where X and Υ are clauses, is by
simple juxtaposition of X with the negative form of Υ (§9.5.3).
9.6.5 Subjunctive clauses under the scope of a distant negative
Simple negative clauses ('she didn't see him,' Ί am not sick') are expressed in the
unmarked indicative mood. That is, the negative morpheme itself is the only
indication of the truth-value status of the underlying (positive) proposition. In this
respect, KCh resembles English and other western European languages, and diverges
from the pattern seen in some (e.g. Australian) languages where ordinary negation is
marked by the combination of a negative morpheme and an irrealis mood form ('it
wasn't that she see-Irrealis him,' 'It's not that I be-Irrealis sick').
However, there are indications that even in KCh, clauses under the scope of a
negation have latent tendencies to take subjunctive rather than indicative form. In other
words, while the KCh subjunctive is predominantly a future-oriented deontic modal
(desiderative, obligational, purposive), it has a second function, admittedly less
conspicuous, as an irrealis (nonactualized) epistemic modal.
We got a hint of this in the use of subjunctive complements after bilaa 'without'
(§9.6.4). Since 'without' has a built-in negative semantic component, perhaps this
(weak) negation rather than deontic modality is responsible for the subjunctive mood.

"Djenne Chiini4199.3.4 Equivalents of negative polarity items
For '(not...) anything', the NP may be haya foo ('thing one') or just haya ('thing'):
hay a (foo) si ηεε 'there is nothing here.' In this instance, the polarity item precedes
the negative (si 'not be').","[434, 435]"
"176 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization
The morpheme rjga! can be used in isolation to mean 'yes!'. Note that rjga
elsewhere functions as the 3SgF pronoun, and as the SFoc (subject-focus) morpheme,
but the etymological connection of the 'yes!' interjection to these grammatical
morphemes is unclear. The form kalaa! means 'no!', again as an isolation form.
However, rjga! and kalaa! are not the preferred responses to polar questions.
Instead, wherever possible, the response to a yes-no question is a truncated echo clause
consisting of a pronominal subject and a nonzero MAN morpheme, the remainder of
the clause being omitted. (293a) shows positive and negative responses to a question
in imperfective aspect, while (293b) shows a negative reply to a question in the
unmarked perfective aspect.
(293)a.b.","[191, 192]"
"It is possible to add the Emph particle yaa to such an answer, hence ay goo yaa
'Yes I will.'
The one case where such a truncated answer is not possible is a positive answer to
a perfective aspect question, since here the MAN slot is vacant, both positive polarity
and perfective aspect being unmarked. In this case, the only possibility is rjga! 'yes!'.
It follows that kalaa!, the corresponding 'no!' interjection, is not obligatory as an
answer to any yes-no question, and is not particularly common in this function.
However, kalaa! can also be used to contradict or challenge an assertion by an
interlocutor.
In (293a), note that Impf goo and its negation sii have their full forms, in contrast
to ο - go and si when followed by an overt VP. These same full forms are also used as
locational quasi-verbs meaning 'be (present)' and 'not be (present), be absent' (§7.1.2).",[192]
"Although wala logically connects two disjunct clauses, in (292) it functions
indirectly as a kind of polar interrogative marker. German .... oder? '..., or?' following
an affirmative sentence has a similar polar interrogative function.",[191]
"155mood: marked subjunctive versus unmarked indicative (§7.2.4);
aspect: marked imperfective versus unmarked perfective (§7.2.2);
negation: marked negative versus unmarked positiveWe do not usually indicate the morphologically unmarked categories indicative,
perfective, or positive in interlinear glosses.
Aside from the three basic binary oppositions in (250), there are some special
forms for presentative imperfectives (§7.2.3), future tense (§7.2.5), and progressives
(§7.2.6).",[171]
"Other such expressions are combinations of a noun with foo or kul, like boro foo
'someone, anyone, no-one' (475a) and haya foo 'something, anything, nothing'
(475b); we may add noqgu foo 'somewhere', saa foo 'some time', ban foo 'some
day', etc. For haya foo as a verb '(do) anything', see §7.1.5.
In (476a), abada (<Ar. 'never') is an autonomous adverbial particle which is far
more common in negative than positive contexts, far! can be thought of as a default
intensifying interjection (§9.2), and is used both in positive ('..., period!') and
negative ('[not]..., at all!') sentences, as in (476b-c).",[274]

VP, where the preverbal MAN morphemes in (464) are not allowed. Likewise, the
(etymologically related) compound final jeηey is the nearest approximation of
negation within a NP.
In addition to clause-internal negation, there is a more complex construction that
can be used with either a NP (466c) or a clause in its scope. The construction begins
with a na oi ... 'it is not ...' When the complement is a clause, the 'that ...'
conjunction kaa is occasionally used (466a), though more often omitted (466b). This
higher-level construction can be used for ""metalinguistic"" negation, e.g., to correct a
phrase or sentence previously uttered by the current speaker (self-correction) or by
someone else. As we will see, a higher-level negation may result in more transparent
scope relationships vis- -vis a quantifier. For now, note the split-level negation in
(466b).

disjunction, yala - yara elsewhere has modal values ranging from desiderative (§9.6.4)
to expectation, cf. (819) in §9.6.5, below.
Truncated echoic replies to yes-no interrogatives, of the form subject pronoun
plus positive go or negative si, occur in DjCh but less systematically than in KCh.
Alternatives are a simple 'yes!' ( h ! with rising pitch on the second syllable) or 'no!'
(δ'δ! with falling pitch) interjection, or a syntactically complete sentence including a

"The composite construction X ci Υ nono occurs chiefly in the negative form X na
ci Υ nono, which functions as the usual negative counterpart of Υ nono, with the
emphasis on identification rather than description. Although the relevant part of (231)
is positive, it is in a yes-no question, which may have favored the longer construction.
A typical negative example is (232).",[162]
"For wala in the sense 'even' (in positive or negative clause), see §8.5.9.
9.3.5 Negation, adverbiale ('again', 'first'), and DF morpheme Only'
jinaa 'first, at first, for the time being' was introduced in §9.3.1, with examples in
positive contexts. It associates an eventuality whose time interval precedes that of
another eventuality, or whose time interval is not seen as permanent.
The combination of jinaa with a preceding negative results in the sense 'not yet*.
A sentence of the general type 'he has not eaten yet' can be paraphrased (however
awkwardly) as 'for now [it is not the case that [he has eaten]],' but not as 'it is not the
case that [he ate first],' which would require a higher-level negation. This shows that
jinaa rather than the negation has wide scope in single-clause combinations. Examples
in (477).

"7.3 Imperatives
Special Impera[tive] forms are limited to second person subject and occur in the
positive only. Expressions used as negative imperatives are identical to negated
subjunctive clauses. It is possible to distinguish the negative-imperative usage from
other subjunctive uses on the grounds that negative imperatives require no external
subjunctive trigger.
There is no aspect marking in imperatives; Impf o is not allowed. The forms are
shown in (263), with indicative counterparts (perfective aspect) provided for
comparison.",[180]
"If the second disjunct in an embedded polar interrogative is simply the negation of
the first, as in (506), one of them may be be omitted, the wala 'whether' on the overt
disjunct implying the second. In this case, the overt clause may be either the negative
or the positive version. The negative version is actually preferred, as in (507), the
literal translation of which is awkward in English.

"7.2.1 MAN morphemes and sequences
Aside from the fact that each categorial subsystem (mood, aspect, negation) has an
unmarked value, there is one further neutralization (aspect is unmarked when the mood
is subjunctive), and one case of morphological fusion of marked categories (Impf +
Neg). The result is that surface MAN strings are extremely simple, only one basic
combination being expressed by a two-morpheme sequence. The surface forms are
those in (251), the MAN forms following the subject NP and immediately preceding
the verb.

Subju NegWe omit imperatives here (see §7.3).
It is clear that ο ~ go is basically an imperfective marker, and that ma is a
subjunctive modal. The distribution of the negatives si and na makes precise analysis
difficult. On the one hand, indicative perfective negative na should be a simple Neg
morpheme, since indicative and perfective are zero categories. This would imply that
indicative imperfective negative si is the surface expression of two marked categories,
Impf plus Neg (also interpreted as indicative due to the absence of subjunctive
marking). This in turn would lead us to expect that the negative marker used with
Subju ma would be the categorially simpler Neg na rather than the more complex
ImpfNeg si, but in fact we get si in the negative subjunctive ma si. To avoid arbitrary
reductionism, I conservatively label 173 as ""Neg."" In the indicative, I label si as
""ImpfNeg,"" but in the combination ma si (where aspect is neutralized) I label si
simply as ""Neg.""
In KCh (particularly in Timbuktu), the variant ο is vastly more common than the
other variant go. Irregular contractions of ο with a word-final vowel in the preceding
(subject) NP or pronoun are discussed in §3.7.1.",[171]
"7.3 Imperatives
With kaa 'come' the forms are: singular positive kaa! 'come!', singular negative ma
si kaa! 'don't come!', plural positive wo kaa!, plural negative wo ma si kaa!. The
only difference vis- -vis KCh is that the plural negative uses the 2PlImpera wo rather
than the full 2P1S form wor, as sometimes in other subjunctive contexts.",[418]
"Here the negative ordinarily has narrow scope regardless of the syntactic role
(subject or nonsubject) of the quantified NP; (469a) can be paraphrased as 'for all x, we
could not see x' rather than 'It is not the case that we could see everyone.'
Comparing the behavior of foo and kul, the generalization is that their
combinations with a negation are interpreted in the manner which produces the
strongest assertion (that with the most precise truth conditions). In the case of foo
One', the strongest reading is the one with wide-scope negation ('not [... one ...]'),
but in that of kul 'all' the strongest reading is the one with narrow-scope negation ('all
[... not...]'). The result is that there is no truth-conditional difference between foo and
kul in negative contexts. One factor favoring kul is that, unlike foo, it can be freely
used with mass (as well as count) NPs, as in (469c). Replacing kul with foo here
would be awkward, though perhaps not impossible, cf. (467c).
The truth-conditionally weaker interpretations of Neg plus kul 'all' can be elicited
provided the context is favorable, as in (470). The preceding material makes it clear
that i-kul na bun means 'they did not all die' (i.e., 'it is not true that, for all χ, χ
died'), not 'none of them died' (i.e., 'for all χ, χ did not die').

"The KCh system of possessive predications is quite different from that of KS and
other Songhay languages to the east.7.1.5 haya foo '(do) anything' and other apparent verbless predicates
There is one construction where an NP with indefinite or interrogative reference
appears to be used as a verb. We first consider haya foo One thing', which can be
used as a negative polarity NP '(not) ... anything' (§9.3.4). However, it appears to
function as a verb in (247a-b).

"A more literal translation is 'it's the truth, if it is not (the case that) [it's the
season which be ruined],1 cf. (285) in §8.5.3. (564) shares with (563) the use of a
higher-level negation and the subject-focus construction in the lower clause, and there
are additional textual examples of exactly this type.
What (562-64) seem to have in common is that a negative operator has semantic
scope over a clause X, but does not appear directly in the normal (preverbal) position
within X itself. Either X is an elaboration or paraphrase of a preceding negated
proposition (minus the Neg marker), or X is negated by a higher-level negation and
itself has a focalized subject NP intervening between this negation and its own VP.
I have no textual examples where non-subject focus, as opposed to subject focus
as in (563-64), combines with higher-level negation to force a shift to subjunctive
mood. For example, (481) in §9.3.5, above, is 'it is not [[only once] [focus] (that) I
drank alcohol]' with indicative mood.",[315]
"As in English, ""negative raising"" is common with 'want'. In (544a) and (546c),
the negation arguably belongs in the subjunctive clause (Ί want that it not be torn'),
but surfaces on the matrix verb (Ί don't want that it be torn'). However, with other
matrix verbs, negation works differently in matrix and subjunctive clauses, as in
(547a-b).

"9.3.3 Negation and quantifiers
A negative morpheme [si sii na} often co-occurs intrasententially with a quantifier.
We begin by considering foo One', which often functions as an indefinite in
existential contexts (467).",[271]
"9.6 Subjunctive complements
The subjunctive mood is expressed by a preverbal morpheme ma, which directly
follows a subject NP. For the irregular 2SgSubj ma replacing the rare fuller sequence
?#/H ma, and the optional irregular ISgSubj ye alongside regular ay ma, see §7.2.4.
The mood marker is always ma after other pronouns and after all full NPs. The
subjunctive may be directly negated, with si following ma. The subjunctive is
therefore a full-fledged, finite clause, lacking only aspectual marking.
In the following sections we describe in greater detail the syntactic and semantic
contexts in which subjunctive clauses occur. We distinguish five construction types
involving an identifiable ""subjunctive trigger"" which calls for this type of clause:
specific matrix-clause verbs like 'want' (§9.6.1); obligational bara (§9.6.2); jussive
reported speech (§9.6.3); certain complementizers (§9.6.4); a distant negative marker
(§9.6.5). In §9.6.6 we discuss cases where there is no (overt) subjunctive trigger.
Finally, in §9.6.7 we consider syntactic issues that cut across these types of cases,
such as multiple subjunctive clauses associated with a single subjunctive trigger.
There are two basic semantic clusters here. The most obvious one is deontic
modality (desiderative, obligational, purposive), which is oriented toward possible
future action. A less conspicuous one involves epistemic modality, specifically, the
suspension of truth-value assertion of a clause under the scope of negation. Both the290 9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics
deontic and the epistemic uses of the subjunctive can be pre-empted by the presence of
stronger modal elements. The deontic use of the subjunctive is pre-empted by an overt
imperative, but this still leaves plenty of deontic ""space"" for the subjunctive to appear
in. On the other hand, the epistemic uses of the subjunctive are mainly associated with
negation, but an overt negative within the clause pre-empts the subjunctive. As a
result, we find an epistemic subjunctive clause most often in syntactic contexts
involving a distanced negation that takes scope over, but is not part of, the
subjunctive clause (§9.6.5). There are, however, some cases of non-negative epistemic
subjunctives (§9.7.8).
9.6.1 Subjunctive complements to matrix-clause verbs
The verbs listed in (543) can take subjunctive clauses as complements. All of them
can also be used as simple transitives. Note that all are oriented toward future
eventualities.

'let, allow*
as transitive: 'leave'
'consent to, allow'
'be accustomed to'
'dislike, hate'
'encourage*
'precede (event)'All of the verbs in (543a-c) allow complements whose subject NP is
noncoreferential to the subject of the matrix verb. In this case, the complement must
appear as a finite subjunctive clause (Ί want that you go,' Ί brought it about that they
come,' 'they prevented that I sleep'). An exception is that a negated jendi occasionally
occurs with an indicative complement whose truth is presupposed ('... does not
prevent [the fact] that...'), as in (365) in §8.4.1, above (cf. French n'empeche que...).
Some of these matrix verbs ('want', 'seek', 'intend', 'consent', 'be accustomed')
also allow complements whose subject NP is preferential to that of the matrix verb.
In this case, the speaker may have two options. In the first, we again get a finite
subjunctive clause (Ί want that I go'). If the matrix-clause subject is not a first or
second person pronoun, the coreferential subjunctive clause subject must be expressed
as a Logo/3Refl (singular or plural) pronoun, hence 'the manx wants that9.6 Subjunctive complements291Logo/3ReflSgx go,' which distinguishes this from the noncoreferential case 'thex man
wants that 3Sgy go.' The subjunctive option is regular for baa in the core sense 'want
(to ...)', as well as with tammahaa 'hope, expect', and it is available as an option
with the 'seek' verbs, as in (544a-d). It also occurs with batu 'wait' (544e). It is not
attested in my data with 'intend', 'consent', or 'be accustomed'.

I use the term ""subjunctive"" to denote the mood category expressed by preverbal MAN
morpheme ma. The negative counterpart is ma si. si is elsewhere specifically
Imperfective Negative (ImpfNeg), but in ma si we gloss it simply as ""Neg.""
Unwary readers of texts might confuse Subju ma with the 2SgS allomorph ma.
When ma is preceded by an overt subject NP (or pronominal), it can only be the
Subju morpheme. The 2SgS interpretation is possible only when no other subject NP
is present. Moreover, Subju ma is always followed either by the verb or by Neg si
plus the verb, while 2Sg ma occurs visibly only in 2Sg (perfective) Neg ma na
VERB ... . When 2SgS and Subju combine, we get a simple ma VERB ... , and one
could argue about whether the ma in this construction is a 2SgS or Subju morpheme;
we gloss it in this case as ""2SgSubju"" (§3.8.3).
The only other irregular subjunctive form is the optional, and fairly uncommon,
ISgSSubju variant ye. The more common variant, ay ma, is regular in form. Some
subjunctive examples are in (258).",[177]
"9.7.6 Quantifying and negative serial verbs
Here we are concerned with serial verbs listed in (583d) in §9.7.2, above, that specify
the extent (positive or negative) to which the eventuality in question was realized.
As a simple verb, hlsa can mean 'fix, prepare, cook (food), make, make well'.
Sometimes it simply denotes production, sometimes it stresses the thoroughness or
high quality of the work of production or repair. As a serial verb, the general sense is
'VP very much, VP a lot'. It is common with verbs denoting gradient adjectival
qualities, as in (595a), but it also occurs with other kinds of VP denoting measurable
activities, as in (595b).

"36411 Semantic topics11.1.5 jinaa 'first', koyne 'again', jaa 'since', hal 'until'
Forjinaa 'first, at first, for a while, for the time being', see discussion beginning
with (457) in §9.3.1, above. This word combines with negation to mean 'not yet'
(§9.3.5).
For koyne 'again' see discussion of examples (456a-c) in §9.3.1. It combines
with negation to mean 'no longer', 'not again', and occasionally 'nor' (='again not'),
see §9.3.5.
The particles jaa 'since' and hal 'until' can take either a following clause, or a
following spatiotemporal phrase (NP, PP, adverbial), as a complement. In concrete
temporal contexts, jaa is glossable as 'since, ever since, from (a certain time)', hal as
'until, up until, as late as, even (now)'. Both particles also have more abstract
syntactic-semantic uses as clause-initial complementizers (§9.5.8, §9.6.4).
jaa and hal may also take apparently narrower scope over a temporal phrase (NP,
PP, adverbial) within a larger sentence. The two are paired, indicating starting and
ending points for an activity, in (702).

"The examples in (405) show clear separation between the negative clause and the
following exception phrase. This is always found with subject NPs, since the subject
NP of the negative clause is always separated from the 'except' phrase by other
material. However, optionally in the case of clause-final direct objects, and even more
commonly with other clause-final constituents (spatiotemporal adverbials,
instrumental phrases), the correlative constituent in the negative clause is dispensed
with and we get what looks like a single clause. Examples in (406).

"9.7.6 Quantifying and negative serial verbs
lilsa 'prepare' does not seem to be used as a serial verb '(do) very much, (do) well'.
The functional equivalent of this KCh serial- verb construction is to add gumo 'well* as
a postverbal adverb.
je ~jen is used in the negative sense 'fail to', like KChjen.
VP [ka tontö] means 'VP some more (additionally)', with tonto ~ tonton 'add,
augment' .",[444]
"Here nda 'with' is used in the comparative sense 'than ...'. In more idiomatic
English translation, 'even' would be shifted ('... which is even harder than cement'). In
KCh, wala in this emphatic sense remains closely attached to the focal constituent.
Perhaps shifting it out of this constituent to any earlier position where wala is
syntactically permitted would risk confusion with this particle's more common sense
Or'.
wala is common in negative sentences ('[not] even'), as in (423).
(423)ay

"9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs311bey 'know' is used in experiential perfects, which nicely fits its basic sense. As a
serial verb it is most common in negatives (Ί have never ...') as in (591b), and
questions ('have you ever ...'), as in D's query in (591a). Note that H's response in
(59la) omits bey, just as 'ever' is omitted in the corresponding translation. The
translation 'have never' in (59 Ib) shows that the negation takes scope over the
experiential perfective ('it is not the case that [I have ever seen him]').
faati 'pass' (<Ar.) is uncommon as a simple verb (cf. bisa 'pass'), but is more
common as a serial verb meaning 'already', as in (59Ic). A negative takes scope over
it, as in (591d), giving the sense 'not [... already]'. This is close to the sense 'not yet',
but the usual way to express this is negation plusjinaa 'first, for now', which is fact
is used in D's repetition of H's point in (591d).
Serial verbs expressing habituality or iteration are oindi 'remain', dooney 'do
habitually', yee 'return', and fitta 'repeat'. In all cases the serial-verb use is closely
related to the core lexical sense. Examples are in (592a-h).

"8.5.3 'Unless' (nda^ a na c/)' and 'except' (bara, kala)
The expression nda^ a na ci... is formally a conditional antecedent clause meaning 'if
3Sg is not ...' (logically equivalent to 'unless 3Sg is ...'), with following predicate
nominal (400). It is very common and is sometimes reduced phonetically to [ndartfi],
[ndantji], [nantji], or the like.

in which case we may gloss it as 'unless ...' (i.e., as 'if it is not the case that ...').
The phrase a na ci... without conditional nda is often used as a higher-level negation
(§9.3.2), and nda^ a na ci ... builds on this, but shifts the MAN marking to
subjunctive (cf. §10.6.5). Like simple a na ci... , the conditional version nda^ a na
ci... often takes a focalized clause as its complement, allowing the negation to include
the focused constituent in its scope, as in (401), cf. also (285a) in §8.1.2, above.

Of the two 'except' particles in KCh, bara is much more common than kala in
Timbuktu (§5.9.9). Both particles also have other functions (or homophones); for
bara see §7.1.3 (existential quasi- verb), §9.5.9 (indicative 'since' complementizer),
and §9.6.2 (impersonal obligational with subjunctive); for kala see §9.5.8 (rare
indicative 'that' complementizer).
In the 'except X' construction that concerns us here, bara or kala precedes the
attached constituent. Often they identify a positive exception to a preceding negative
proposition; see the following section. However, bara or kala can also identify an
exception to a positive proposition, as in (403).

"Semantically, the negation has wide scope in all cases, even when the indefinite is
in subject position, preceding the negation, as in (467a-c), or when the indefinite is a
preposed topical constituent, as in (467e). Thus (467a) can be paraphrased as 'It is not
the case that for some χ, χ knows' but not as 'For some χ, χ doesn't know.' The
combinations boro foo 'someone, anyone, no-one* and haya foo 'something,
anything, nothing' are very common.
When the indefinite NP consists of a bare noun without foo, we get examples
like those in (468).

masteryWith a mass noun like 'wind' in (468a), it is clear that the negation again has
wide scope ('it is not the case that there was some wind'). With a countable noun like
bor(o) 'person* in (468b), on the other hand, we can construe it generically, in which
case there is no clear truth-conditional difference between wide-scope negation ('for no
representative χ is it the case that χ could control it') and narrow-scope negation ('for a
representative χ, χ could not control it'). However, even such cases are at least
compatible with a wide-scope reading.
The other high-frequency quantifier in negative sentences is kul 'all, every, each*.
Some examples are in (469).

"In (288b), the war ra 'in you(Pl)' is a delayed partitive for the fronted 'who?'.
The identificational quasi-verb nono (§7.1.1), as in nono 'it is (a) Y,' does not
permit its sole overt NP to be focalized. We therefore cannot tell on this basis whether
the ""Y"" NP is a syntactic subject (requiring SFoc rjga} or a nonsubject (requiring Foe
nä). It is also not possible to focalize out of the main clause in an impersonal bara
construction, of the form bara plus embedded clause (§7.1.3). This is an obvious
consequence of the lack of any NP in the main (as opposed to embedded) clause.
On the other hand, focalization is possible with the locational quasi-verbs,
positive goo and negative sii (§7.1.2), and with the identificational copula verb ci
(§7.1.1). See the interrogative examples (295a) and (296b-c) in §8.2.2, below.
However, in the case of ci, an emphatic and apparently focalized subject NP may
dispense with SFoc rjga, as seen by the absence of this morpheme in (289).

Def8.2 Questions and answers
8.2.1 Polar (yes-no) questions and answers
KCh has no reliable polar interrogative morpheme. The usual simple polar question
has the form of an assertion, usually with rising terminal intonation (290a). Some
younger speakers use clause-initial eska (Fr est-ce que ...?), which is widespread in8.2 Questions and answers175Malian languages. A morpheme kona (variants koni, kooni) is attested as an apparent
clause-initial polar interrogative marker (290b), but it is very rare in my data and is
probably a dialectal borrowing from Fulfulde.

"9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs319The three options are of the schematic types (ΟΙ) Ά is more than Β,' (Ο2) Ά
equals B,' and (O3) Ά is less than B.' In English, the sequence could be expressed
without changing the order of the comparanda, facilitating syntactic reduction: 'should
the flavor of the sugar be more than, equal to, or less than that of the tea leaves?' In
KCh, however, the O3 option requires reversal of the ordering ('B is more than A') if
the bisa construction is adhered to.
Another option for Ά is less than B' is a main-clause negation plus an attached
infinitival VP with too 'attain, reach, be the equal of, as in (610). Note that the
infinitival VP is included in the scope of the negative, otherwise the translation would
be Ί equal him in (extent of) not eating.'","[334, 335]"

"5.4.7 Currency and time of day
The local currency is the CFA franc, which is held at a fixed exchange rate to the
French franc (FF) and is shared with the other Francophone West African countries5.4 Numerals and other quantifiers95(except Mauritania). The rate was 50 CFA = 1 FF for many years until 1994, when it
was abruptly devalued to 100 CFA = 1 FF. In the early years of Malian independence,
there was a Malian franc (franc malien).
However, currency is normally calculated in terms of the 'riyal' (<Spanish real, via
Arabic). The usual KCh pronunciation is allaara; an older form alliyaara is found in
other Songhay dialects and points to an Arabic prototype such as *ar-riyaal(a) via
metathesis of r and 1.
The riyal was a colonial-era coin of high value. Terms for smaller colonial-era
coins like koboro are now used chiefly in 'red cent' negative polarity usage ('he didn't
give me even a koboro'). As the colonial currency was displaced first by the franc
malien and then by the CFA franc, the vernacular term allaara was equated with
multiples of these new official units, and currency continues to be calculated in riyals
in the native languages (though not in local French). One riyal is equivalent to 5 CFA
francs. Therefore, in the marketplace, waraqka 'twenty' denotes the 100 CFA coin and
jember foo One thousand' denotes the 5000 CFA banknote. However, milyo foo One
million' (cf. French million) is directly equated with 1,000,000 CFA (French million
francs) rather than a million riyals (=5,000,000 CFA).
In stating the unit prices of commodities, distributive reduplications of numerals
are commonly used (§5.4.4).
Clock times are now commonly expressed in French (e.g. trois heures et demi
'3:30'). The traditional time-of-day expressions revolve around the five daily Muslim
prayers as coordinates, supplemented by a few other expressions. See §11.1.4 for
details.
5.4.8 Quantification over pronouns
The interaction of quantifiers with pronouns is tricky, since there are three basic
semantic possibilities, exemplified by 'three of us' (partitive), 'we three'
(enumerating), and Our three' (possessive).
The partitive is most clearly expressed by combining a locative PP of the type yer
kuna 'in us' (or 'from us) with the quantified NP, as in (118); for Loc PPs in partitive
function see §5.4.10. The quantified phrase is an autonomous NP; note boro 'person'
as head noun in (118a). The locative PP may immediately precede the quantified NP, as
in (118a-b), or it may occur at or near the end of the clause (see §5.4.10).

"A much more colorful and slightly vulgar alternative is laafriiti, which can be
used as a serial verb meaning roughly 'VP a hell of a lot'. This stem (from an Arabic
noun denoting a type of djinn) is also used after a noun or adjective as an intensifier ('a
hell of a N').
The serial verbs denoting failure to accomplish an expected or intended event are
jen 'fail at' and morjgo 'have no power over, fail at'. As serial verbs, jen indicates
nonperformance of an action, while moqgo (596c) indicates inability to perform the
action, jen is most common in the negative 'not fail to VP' (596a) but also occurs in
the positive; moggo is usually positive (596b). jen is etymologically related to the
noun -jegey 'lack', used as a compound final (§4.6.5).

"Essentially, haya foo here functions as a kind of ""etcetera"" verb that can be
roughly glossed 'be or do anything'. Its clause is generally the last in a series of
negative clauses, and caps them by generalizing the negation to the set of imaginable154 7 VP structure
propositions of the same general sort as the preceding ones. In (247a) the preceding
verbja/a 'cut, carve' is used in a mediopassive sense 'be cuttable', so here haya foo
represents 'be X-able' for any similar transitive action verb, for example 'carve' or
'break'. In (247b), haya foo caps the series 'get tired ... , break a sweat ...' and by
implication denotes the set of similar expressions involving fatigue or other
discomfort.
Like haya foo in (247), interrogative maa 'what?' (§8.2.2) can be used as an
apparent verb, as in (248).

transitive as in (249a-b).","[169, 170]"
"However, when the sentence with negation and koyne follows a parallel negative
clause ('notX'), we occasionally get the reading '... not [Y] either', paraphrasable as
'again [it is not the case that [Y]]', where koyne rather than the negator has wide
scope. The final koyne in (479) appears to be an example of this. The first koyne after
alhoor 'limestone' is probably anticipatory, giving a 'neither X, nor Y' construction.

Introduction1.1 Generalities about Songhay
Songhay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.

""
eastern Songhay (S. oriental)
central Songhay (S. central)For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning21 Introductionwith Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
(Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"1.3 Format of grammar
The present grammar of KCh is written in a fairly strict format to facilitate
comparison to the appendices and to my forthcoming parallel descriptions of other
Songhay languages. The numbering of chapters and sections thereof will be held
constant to the extent possible, although this means that in each grammar some
subsections are blank (e.g., ""tonology"" in the present grammar). In Appendix 1 on the
""upriver"" (Goundarm, Niafunke) varieties, and to a lesser extent in Appendix 2 on
DjCh, we disregard areas where their grammars do not differ significantly from that of
Timbuktu KCh (perhaps giving an example or two), reserving extended analysis for
areas where they differ from Timbuktu.
The format of the grammar is not revolutionary, and its general nature can be
gleaned from a pass through the table of contents. We begin with a brief overview
chapter (2), designed to give readers an idea what a simple Songhay sentence looks
like. Fortunately, the language is simple morphologically and readers should be able to
pick up its basic sentence structure quickly. A brief chapter on phonology (3) leads to
two chapters (4, 5) on nominal constructions, the first focusing on derivational
processes (also including information on personal and demonstrative pronouns), the
second describing NP inflection and phrasal syntax.
Verbs likewise get two chapters (6, 7), one mainly on voice categories expressed
by suffixation (or by zero), the other on mood-aspect-negation (MAN) inflection and
VP structure.
The next chapter (8) turns to ""information packaging"" issues such as focus, topic,
and relativization. These are all of great importance in Songhay discourse, and it turns
out that there are important differences among the Songhay varieties in the respective
forms and functions. This is followed by a chapter (9) on complex (interclausal)
syntax, in which various types of ""serial verb"" construction play important roles. The
final grammatical chapter (10) is on anaphora; the most significant topic here is the
use of logophoric and reflexive versus ordinary personal pronouns.
The last chapter (11) looks at selected lexical semantic matters, including the
lexical division of labor in expressing spatiotemporal concepts, and some
ethnosemantic issues such as kinship and emotion terminology.
A volume of Texts in Koyra Chiini (Songhay of Timbuktu) is in press with
Koppe Verlag, Cologne. It includes texts from Timbuktu, Niafunke (an ""upriver""
dialect), and Djenne. A set of three Songhay-English-French dictionaries is to be
published by rHarmattan, Paris. One of the three is KCh (Timbuktu to Niafunke), and
another is for DjCh (the third is KS of Gao).",[21]
"9.6.2 Subjunctive complements of obligational bara
bara occurs in various functions: verb of existence (§7.1.3), 'except' particle (§8.5.3),
and 'because ...' particle (§9.5.7). Leaving these aside, it occurs sentence-initially in
two impersonal constructions, one with following bare indicative complement
associated particularly with oaths and other strong assertions (§9.5.9), the other with a
following subjunctive complement, usually in obligational sense (bara [X Subju see
Y] = 'X must see Y').
In the subjunctive (mainly obligational) construction that concerns us here,
nothing precedes bara within the sentence. Negation is expressed inside the
subjunctive clause (bara [X Subju not see Y] = 'X must not see Y'). Focus too is
expressed, if at all, inside the subjunctive clause, as in the elicited examples (552a-b).

"In (285a-d), a nonzero MAN morpheme intervenes between rjga and the verb, as
the schema in (283) allows. The nonzero MAN morphemes are Subju ma (285a),
ImpfNeg si (285b), Neg na (285c), and Impf o (285d). In the cases with negation, the
negative has scope only over the backgrounded core sentence. Thus (285c) means 'it's
my whole head that did not bring it up' rather than 'it's not my whole head that
brought it up.'

As noted in §7.1.2 and §8.2.1, ο - go and si are arguably identical to the
locational quasi-verbs 500 (positive) and sii (negative).
The 2Sg pronoun, elsewhere ni, shows some irregularities. The 2SgS (perfective)
Neg sequence is ma na instead of #ni na. The 2Sg ma allomorph is also possibly
present in 2SgSSubju ma (if reduced from #ma ma) and is clearly present in 2SgDat
mana- mane. See §3.8.2 for discussion.
The ISg pronoun, usually ay, has an optional ISgSSubju variant ye alongside
regular ay ma, see §3.8.1.","[171, 172]"
"The vast majority of causatives are expressed by using the productive Causfative]
derivation (§6.2.2), or by simply switching valency with no overt change in the verb
stem (§6.2.1). However, (548) is an appropriate use of the more complex (but more
transparent) analytic causative construction, since the lower clause contains an internal
negation which could not be precisely captured in a compressed monoclausal version.
Next we consider verbs of allowing and preventing (543c). In these constructions,
the subject of the subjunctive clause is almost always distinct from the subject NP of
the matrix clause. Examples in (549).

'prevent' (= 'not let'), have the subjunctive complement. This is a further indication
that deontic modality (here: intention) is more significant than degree of likely truth in
determining the use of the subjunctive mood.
For nan 'let', I have also recorded a construction with an intervening hal 'so that'
(in other contexts 'until'), as in (550a). For hal as subjunctive trigger see §9.6.4. In
villages near Timbuktu, nan can take indicative as well as subjunctive complements;
an indicative example is (550b). I did not hear such a construction in Timbuktu itself.

"7.1.1 Quasi-verbs ci (equational) and nono (identificational)
The unnegated equational-quasi verb is pronounced ci or si, the latter being common in
the local basilect. In general, each speaker uses one variant or the other consistently.
Care must be taken to distinguish this si (which always precedes a NP) from ImpfNeg
si (which always directly precedes a verb), and from negative locational si (next
section). As in KCh, the quasi-verb normally occurs in unmarked (perfective) aspect
(742a) and is therefore negated by na (742). In this combination the quasi-verb is
pronounced ti (742b).

"3129 Sentence-level syntax and semanticscindi 'remain' can be used with imperfective aspect, as in (592a), to indicate
present-time continuity. However, this serial verb is especially common with
unmarked (perfective) aspect, indicating past habitual ('used to'), dooney can often be
glossed 'be accustomed to', but as (592b) shows it need not have a sentient agent and
the most appropriate general gloss is 'do usually*.
yee 'return' is semantically weak, and even in simple motion contexts it nearly
always combines with either Centripetal -kate in the sense 'come back' (§6.3.3), or
with another motion verb in a serial construction, like yee ka koy (592d). In the
more abstract sense 're-VP, VP again' with a non-motional substantive VP, we
generally get either filla 'repeat' by itself (592e-f,h) or a combination of yee and filla
in either order (592c,g). filla is notable in that it optionally omits the usual Inf ka
before the following substantive VP. ka is absent after filla in (592c,e,g), but present
in (592h). Both yee and filla combine easily with a negative in the sense 'not VP
again' or 'no longer VP'. In both positive and negative contexts, yee and filla are
often reinforced by the adverbial particle koyne 'again' (§1 1.1.5), as in (592c,e-f).
duu 'get, earn' as serial verb is best glossed 'proceed to VP' or '(and) then VP'.
This hopefully captures the flavor of this combination, which indicates sequencing
after the previously described event but also adds a little extra foregrounding (593).

"9.5.3 Juxtaposed clauses in adverbial function ('while', 'without')
When two clauses are juxtaposed, the second sometimes functions as a temporal
adverbial clause translatable as 'while' (if positive) or 'without' (if negative), as in
(501). 'While' is to be taken in its temporal (= 'during') rather than adversative sense
(= 'whereas'). Note that 'without knowing' is logically equivalent to 'while not
knowing', so the 'while' is consistent.

[2SgS-Impf pass [3Sg by]] [2SgS ImpfNeg know]
'You'll pass by it without knowing'This type of construction normally consists of an initial clause denoting a
foregrounded event, followed by a brief second clause denoting a temporally extended
state or process that is not caused by the first event. The best way to make sense of
such a combination is to infer that the second clause denotes a background situation
whose temporal interval contains that of the event denoted by the first clause. The
second clause is most often in imperfective aspect. It can, however, be in the
unmarked perfective aspect, for example when this clause is negated, as in (648a-b) in
§10.2.4.
There is no overt morpheme meaning precisely 'while ...'. Both saa di kaa ...
'when ..., (at) the time that...' and nda ... 'if (when) ...' are strongly associated with
temporal sequence rather than overlap. The only obvious alternative to (501a), then, is2729 Sentence-level syntax and semanticsto invert the order (""There was no wind; the rain struck'). In the case of 'without',
there is an alternative construction involving bilaa 'without' (<Ar.) and a subjunctive
clause, see §9.6.4.
When two juxtaposed clauses are both imperfective, they may be fused in
somewhat the same way as in (501), but it is not always the case that the second
clause functions as an adverbial modifier of the first. Consider (502).

"5.4 Numerals and other quantifiers895.4.2 Existential quantification
Existential quantifification is generally associated with the initial introduction of a
referent into a discourse. This may be accomplished either by an overt predication of
existence or location ('There was a dog'), or by using an indefinite NP in a larger
sentence (Ά dog was sitting on the lawn,' or Ί saw a dog on the lawn'). For
predications of existence, see §7.1.2-3.
Within a NP, KCh has no special form specifically for existential quantification,
corresponding to the English indefinite article (a dog), the bare plural (dogs) for count
nouns, the bare singular for mass nouns (water), or existential some (some dogs, some
water).
The numeral foo One' can sometimes be translated as an English singular
indefinite article, viz., when a new singular discourse referent is introduced with no
special focus on its number. Therefore the NP boro foo can be rendered as either One
person' or 'a person'. However, when a new referent is introduced, the foo is merely
optional, and it always seems to have more of its numerical value than does English
a(n). Moreover, foo cannot normally be used with a mass noun. See the examples in
(105).

the existence of any denoted entity, as in (106).

'You(Sg) didn't pay (=haven't paid) anything.'(106) means, in quasi-logical notation, 'There is not (even) one χ such that χ is a
thing and you paid x.' For more on interactions between foo and negation, see §9.3.3.
Some examples of reduplication and parallelism discussed in §5.4.4 also have
existential implications, though no such construction is purely existential.
5.4.3 Universal quantification (kul 'all')
The only serious candidate for universal quantifier ('all, every') is kul (<Ar. kull 'all').
However, this morpheme has a considerably wider syntactic and semantic range than
does an ordinary universal quantifier. For the important use of kul in marking the right
boundary of a conditional antecedent or similar background clause, see §9.5.10.","[104, 105]"

See also (247b) in §7.1.5, above, bara can also be used as a clause-initial
'because ..."" particle (§9.5.9), and in examples like (407a) one could possibly construe
bara in this way. kala, for its part, is sometimes used as a 'that' complementizer
(§9.5.8). Close attention to context is required in analysing textual occurrences of
bara and kala.
In (407b-c), English would normally omit the repeated subject NP and the tense
inflection in the exception clause, which would therefore be syntactically a VP ('She
does nothing except sleep'). In KCh, complete clauses including subject NPs are
required.
Although the construction with bara or kala is quite productive, we also find
textual examples with nda^ a na ci... 'if it (he, she) is not ...' expressing exceptions
to negative clauses. In this case, the exception clause may precede (408a) or follow
(408b) the main negative clause.
