Any of the negation expressions described in 1.4.1 may itself be negated by the
postverbal modifier 'a/'ara ‘negative’. The result of this double negation is an emphatic
positive reading. While either 'a (singular, simple form) or 'ara (plural, intense form)
may be used, 'ara is the form most likely to be chosen for use in double negatives
because of its added meaning of intensity. Note (305d), where the combination of 'ara xi'
(‘negative dubitative’) can be glossed as an emphatic positive or ‘because’ (see (137),
cause clauses, 1.1.2.4.2.4(1)). Note also that when 'am occurs as the second negative with
xi', it does not prohibit the use of the Tense VICS (see 1.1.1.4.1, where it is noted that
'a/'ara normally requires the use of Tenseless VICS).

raram ‘2s:rf-3pf’, or rain ‘2s:rf-3n’. In addition, yes-no questions may also be expressed
in the form of leading questions using xin (1pincl:rf-3n) in conjunction with the sentencefinal particles ne ‘rec. past’ and/or pane ‘rem:past’, with either declarative or
interrogative intonation. A final type of leading question uses na' nam ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p3sf’ (addressing a mixed or feminine audience) and na' non ‘3s:rp/p 3s:rp/p-3sm’

Sentence negation is expressed in three ways.

number of ways:
1 The dubitative particle xi' (see time clauses—1.1.2.4.2.1(2)) interacts with negative
postverbal modifiers to produce a strong positive. This is then interpreted as ‘because’.
2 Irrealis verbal modification clauses are used in such a way that their basic reading of
affirmative is interpreted as negative, and vice versa.
3 The verb 'om ‘not exist’ is negated or otherwise modified in three different ways.
4 Contraexpective verbal modification clauses which, by their nature carry a negative
connotation, are sometimes used to express cause.
There are also two other unrelated ways to express cause:
5 Pain subordinate clauses
6 Equative clauses.
(1) The dubitative particle xi' functioning in cause clauses
Where xi' seems to express indefinite or hypothetical time in time clauses, it interacts
with the postverbal modifier 'ara to produce a reading of either 'because' or
noncontradictory sentence emphasis (see 1.11.1.1). Either a causal or emphatic reading
may be derived when 'ara xi' occurs in a fully independent clause. But only the causal
interpretation is possible when the clause containing 'ara xi' occurs with another clause,
to which it exhibits a semantically subordinate relationship. A subordinate 'ara xi' clause
must follow its matrix clause. However, pause and intonation indicate that they are
separate clauses, at least phonologically. Therefore, here as in other cases above, the
terms superordinate, matrix, and subordinate indicate semantic relations and possibly
syntactic relations as well.

with the emphatic particle ta. The irrealis verbal modification clause follows the clause it

clause left unexpressed. Though unexpressed, the modified clause is clear from context.

There are three ways in which the verb 'om ‘not exist’ can be negated or otherwise
modified to render a causal reading. Two of these ways render a positive reading and one
way renders a negative reading.
(i) The most common way of deriving the relevant causal reading from an 'om clause
is via the irrealis INFL xi, as described in the preceding section (illustrated in examples
(139)). 'Om ‘not exist’ is the main verb and, since the ‘subject’ of this clause is a noun
clause and its gender is neuter, only the Tenseless third person neuter VIC ne may
accompany the verb. These clauses must follow the clause they modify semantically. We
see little evidence of a syntactic or phonological link between these 'om clauses and the
clauses they modify however. The relationship seems mainly semantic. It is interesting to
compare examples (140a–b) and (140c–d): (140a) and (140c) are taken from the text
gathered fifteen to twenty years ago; these same sentences are now expressed by young
native speakers as (140b) and (140d), with the postverbal modifier 'ara ‘negative plural’
accompanying the verb. The presence of 'ara makes no difference in the meaning of the
cause construction.

Xin is the first person plural inclusive realis future VIC suffixed by the third person
neuter object VIC. It may also be used idiomatically as a leading question particle, which
reveals a measure of curiosity or amazement on the part of the speaker and expects an
affirmative answer. It is often accompanied by the temporal particles ne ‘recent past’ or
pane ‘remote past’, and more rarely the referent particle quem, or the emphatic particle
ta. Ne is the most common particle to occur with xin. It occurs sentence-finally and seems
to have the following functions in many environments: it modifies the verb in some
subordinate sentences (see time clauses—1.1.2.4.2.1; and contraexpective clauses—
1.1.2.4.2.8); it is a type of ‘attention-getter’, drawing attention to a spoken or unspoken
situation (i.e. ‘I’m expecting a response from you’); it expresses uncertainty; and as one
of a set of temporal particles, it means ‘recent/ immediate past’. When occurring with xin,
it seems to function as an ‘attention-getter’. No doubt its meaning of uncertainty or
recent/ immediate past also plays a role here, and since another temporal particle, pane
‘rem:past’ also appears with xin, we will gloss ne as a temporal particle in leading
questions.

negation; it interacts with negative postverbal modifiers to express a strong positive
causal meaning; it appears with certain nonsubordinate condition clauses; it can mean
‘certainly’ to express emphasis; and it seems to be able to express indefinite or
hypothetical time in xi' time clauses. It is not to be confused with the irrealis INFL
morpheme xi (note the absence of the glottal plosive), nor the first person inclusive realis
future VIC xi'. In xi' time clauses, only third person realis past/present VICS (na/nana)
may appear. Xi' time clauses precede their superordinate clauses and, like v 'i…ne time
clauses, pause and falling intonation indicate that they are independent phonologically.
There does not seem to be as much connection between xi' time clauses and their
superordinate clauses as is the case with v 'i…ne clauses, in that they are less likely to
occur with a superordinate clause. However, there does seem to be an apparent
morphosyntactic constraint holding between the VICS of the two clauses, namely, they
must both be in realis past/present. Note in example (128c) that a string of xi' clauses
precedes a series of main clauses that seem to be functioning as the clauses to which the
xi' clauses are subordinate. Note also that the second xi' clause is a sequential sentence
which generally functions as the superordinate clause of time clauses, as in the v ‘i…ne
discussed previously.
It should be noted that, while we have found many examples of xi' time clauses in text,
native speakers declare that its use is bad grammar. We do not yet understand this
discrepancy between frequent use versus intuitions of unacceptability of xi' clauses by
native speakers. They say v 'i… ne constructions are the most correct way to express time
clauses. Xi' time clauses are italicized in the following examples:

1.3.1. Means of expressing coordination
There are no simple equivalents of ‘and’-, ‘but’- and ‘or’-coordination, but there are ways
to express this notion in the language. The constructions described here do not
exclusively express a coordination relationship however. They have other functions and
their form is simply 'exploited' to express coordination as well. Most of the examples in
this section are taken from text.
1.3.1.1. ‘and’-coordination
There are two ways to accomplish the effect of ‘and’-coordination between clauses:
(1) Juxtaposition: When two or more clauses are juxtaposed within a single sentence
or across sentence boundaries, ‘and’-coordination can be construed. The second and
following clauses are often of the verbalized sequential sentence type described in

involved in a monologue or a dialogue. The response usually consists of a more-or-less

appropriate changes in the verbal inflectional clitics. However the response is worded, it
often ends with some kind of emphatic element, such as the sentence-final particles in

indicates the hearer’s empathy with what the speaker is saying.",[43]

Question-word questions take the form of COMP sentences. The question word always
occurs sentence-initially as the operator word in COMP. See 1.1.1.4.2, where we discuss
the functions that operator words signal, the basic structure of COMP sentences, and the
ways various concepts of question words are expressed.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Elements of the sentence that can be questioned1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Constituents of the main clause that can be questioned: Although most ‘ON
sentences consist of only the VP (verb, with possible pre- and/or postverbal modifiers,
and the VIC), the occurrence of one argument (expressed subject, object, indirect object,Syntax17locative, instrumental, or temporal phrase) is common. Two or more arguments may also
occur, though rarely. It is, however, possible to construct a (rather unnatural) sentence
with up to four phrases in addition to the verb, as seen in the examples in (14) below:

sentence which follows the sentence it modifies. Like the xi 'om ne clause, this second,
positive 'om clause seems to combine paratactically with its preceding clause in that it is
interpreted as a single semantic unit with the preceding clause, but is phonologically and
syntactically separate. This type of 'om clause is a simple sentence whose subject is a
noun clause, in which the postverbal modifier 'a ‘negative’ following the verb 'om ‘not
exist’ requires the use of a Tenseless VIC—see the discussion in 1.1.1.4.1. The only
possible syntactic link we can see between the two clauses is that 'om 'a ne clauses can
follow only superordinate clauses that manifest the realis past/present tense/mood. The
only examples of 'om 'a ne that we have in our corpus are in text gathered many years
ago. It is used rarely nowadays.

"Wari'
The first major study of any Chapakuran language makes an important contribution to the
database of linguistic theory, and is one of the most detailed descriptions ever published
of any Amazonian language. This study is especially timely as the Chapakuran languages
of Western Brazil and Eastern Bolivia are endangered, and less than 2,000 known
speakers of Wari' and its related dialects are left in existence.
The authors offer a unique, comprehensive grammatical description of Wari', covering
areas such as syntax, negation, morphology, phonology, ideophone/interjection and
lexicon.
This descriptive grammar will appeal to linguistic scholars and students alike.
Daniel L.Everett is a specialist on a variety of Amazonian languages and is currently
Professor and Chair of the Department of Linguistics, University of Pittsburgh. Barbara
Kern, a native of California and missionary linguist belonging to New Tribes Mission,
has lived among the Wari' people for nearly 34 years and speaks their language fluently.","[1, 2]"

sentence in it. The irrealis INFL morpheme xi must be used. The negation sentence is
italicized and the derived predicate of the desiderative sentence is in brackets in the

verb na ‘to consent’ forms a verb compound with their derived predicates. They differ,
however, in the verbal inflectional clitics that can be used in their derived predicates.
Desideratives use only irrealis VICS; refusals use only the second person singular realis
future VIC. The use of verbalized refusal sentences is very limited. We have only
recorded them embedded in a COMP negation sentence. We have not recorded any
examples with an NP object in the derived predicate. Moreover, since only second person
can be used as the subject of the derived predicate, they never have an NP subject. The
subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the embedded clause.
Primary stress falls on the last syllable of the derived predicate, i.e. the verb na ‘to
consent’.

1.1.1.3. Imperative sentences
Normal imperative sentences are marked by the use of the realis future tense/mood. There
are also emphatic final particles which typically occur in imperative sentences, though
their use is not limited to imperatives.
1.1.1.3.1. (Positive) imperative
There is no difference in the basic structure of (positive) imperative and simple
declarative sentences. They constitute a single sentence type formally: neither have an
operator word in COMP, both have simple verb structures, and both employ TenseWari'34VICS—see 1.1.1.4. Their one distinguishing characteristic is the use of the second person
realis future VIC in imperatives.
The emphatic morphemes 'e' ‘motion away from the speaker’ and me ‘motion toward
the speaker’ are used frequently with imperatives. 'E' intensifies the imperative; me is
used when the action is for the benefit of the speaker. Their distribution is
complementary. They occur optionally at the end of the sentence.
Two other emphatic particles optionally occur with imperative sentences: wira
(spoken by men) and cama (spoken by women). These morphemes simply intensify the
action of the verb. They do not usually occur with 'e' and me, but when they do, they
follow them at the end of the sentence.
The emphatic particle ta also occurs optionally at the end of imperative sentences. It
immediately follows 'e'. (We have not registered me ta in imperatives, though it is very
common in prohibitives.) It is also optionally followed by wira or cama.

There are no forms that mark the potential mood exclusively.
2.1.3.4.8. Degree of certainty
The modal value of certainty/uncertainty is expressed by realis future—see the paragraph
preceding (599) in 2.1.3.2.1.4. The modal value of supposition is expressed by the two
kinds of verbalized supposition sentence described in 1.1.1.4.3.2.3, which employ realis
past/present and realis future—see the examples in that section.
2.1.3.4.9. Authority for assertion
There is no formal way in which the speaker can indicate his authority for making an
assertion. The use of direct speech to express the concept of indirect speech, discussed in
1.1.1.1, is, however, a way to express degrees of authority for making an assertion of
secondhand information. When active VICS are used following the speech (derived
predicate of the verbalized sentence), the information is considered reliable. WhenMorphology319passive VICS are used, the information is not as reliable, although it does not mean that it
is unreliable. See example (1a) and (1b) in 1.1.1.1.
2.1.3.4.10–11. Hortatory and monitory

There are two classes of inflectional clitics: (1) verbal inflectional clitics, or VICS, which
are marked for person, number and, in some cases, tense/ mood and third person gender
of subjects and objects—see 2.1.3.6.2.2; and (2) possessive nominal inflectional clitics,
or NICS, which mark person, number, and third person gender, appear in derived nouns
and may also follow unpossessed nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6.
1.16.9. Particles
Particles are simple (i.e. phonological) clitics that generally occur at or near the end of
the sentence—see 2.1.8.
1.16.10. INFL morphemes
INFL morphemes cliticize to the verb in COMP sentences, noun clauses and derived
nouns (see 2.1.8.1.9) and express tense/mood and sometimes gender of the element in
COMP (whether overt or covert).
1.16.11. Operator words
Operator words are a small class of words that appear in COMP in COMP sentences—
see 2.1.8.1.10.

Ideophones are onomatopoeic words that express the sound of actions. Many ideophones
deviate from phonological norms of the language: (1) some employ phonological units
not found elsewhere in the language; (2) vowels are often exaggeratedly lengthened; and
(3) varied intonation is often employed: high, low, whispered, etc. See 4.1.","[229, 230]"
