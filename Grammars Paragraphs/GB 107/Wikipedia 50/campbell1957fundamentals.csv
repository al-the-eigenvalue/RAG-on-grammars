"15. A. 1. “Yes” and “No”.
There are no two words in Thai which can be considered as being the
equivalents of “Yes” and “No” in English and plain affirmative and negative
answers are given in a variety of ways depending on the way in which the
question is asked.
This fact usually causes difficulty to the foreigner who is accustomed to
using “Yes” and “No” quite freely in a large number of sentences where they
are in many cases fairly redundant and are merely added for emphasis or to
smooth out the sentence and make it sound less abrupt.
You have already seen some of the ways in which Thai people give
affirmative and negative answers and we will now bring all these and some
other forms together for comparison.
(a) In Lesson 1 you had CHY “it is” and MY CHY “it is not”, but
these two words are often used alone in sentences where in English we would also add “Yes” or “No”.

CONVERSATION2. A. 1. (a). Grammar Notes.
A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of
the verb or, in certain cases, after it. (See Lesson 7.)
When a negative word qualifies an adjective it is usually placed between
the noun and the adjective (Example 21.)
The future tense is indicated by putting the word JA “will”, “shall”
in front of the verb.
In most cases questions in the future tense can be answered in the
present tense.
The answer to a question is generally made as short as possible and in
many cases will consist only of a repetition of the verb in the case of an affirmative answer, or the verb preceded by a negative word in the case of a negative
answer.
The position of adverbs and adverbial clauses is variable. Generally the
adverb of time comes at the beginning of the sentence but we can add emphasis
to it by putting it at the end.
Other adverbs and adverbial clauses may go either at the beginning or end of
the sentence but the position of each particular one is usually fairly constant.
Adverbs or adverbial clauses seldom come in the middle of a sentence. For
instance;
“Go to the market and buy some eggs”
would be rendered in Thai as,
“Go buy some eggs at the market”
Interrogative adverbs and some adverbs of time such as “always”, “often”,
“soon” etc. are usually placed at the end of the sentence.","[30, 31]"
"MY CHY KRUP

a question is merely to repeat the verb on its own for the
affirmative or the verb preceded by the negative word MY for
the negative.

If you are not careful you can get very mixed up in these negative
questions and the unusual, though quite logical, reply, and it is better to try and
avoid them if possible.
The Thai themselves do not use the negative form of question very much in
conversation.
These short answers given to questions in Thai sound rather abrupt
when translated into English but they are perfectly alright in Thai and you need
not be afraid to use them.
Although we have tabulated the various forms of question and answer
above, there are no fixed rules as to when to use one or the other particular
form and in fact most of them are fairly interchangeable. Once you have had a
little practice in the language you will have no difficulty in forming an appropriate reply to any question.

REU is similar to MY but is not such a good word to use generally. In
many cases it does not sound very “polite”. It is however the general word to
use in the following circumstances.

(d) In a long drawn out form REU-U-U as an expression of surprise.
PRALAHT J Y MAHK REU

As you will see if you examine these questions, it can be broadly said that if you
use REU it usually implies that you expect an affirmative answer.
Negative questions of the form of (b) above are not very common in
Thai and should be avoided for the present as the answer is rather tricky. See
Examples 8 and 12 Para 5 of this lesson.
— 87 —This type of question will be dealt with more fully again in Lesson 15 A.
There are many exceptions to the above general rules on question
words and in many cases alternative forms of question are equally acceptable
just as they are in English.
Experience in the language alone will enable you to pick out the most appropriate form for each occasion.","[101, 102, 103]"
"This word NIT is a diminutive but is seldom met with except as above in
combination with other words, or as a first name for men or women.
NOY is also used at the end of an imperative sentence to soften down the
command. It then has almost the meaning of “please”.
(See Lesson 21)
SATAHNEE (cftlTU) corresponds closely with the English word “station”
and is used in the same way except that it does not make a verb similar to
“stationed at”. It may be used for a “railway station”, “police station”,
“petrol station” etc.
LER-Y (iclfj) is a word which is often added onto the end of a negative
sentence to give emphasis and can fairly well be translated as “at all” in most
cases.

"LUP (H01l) “to be asleep” is very seldom used alone.

(lie down asleep) which has the rather irregular negative.
NORN MY LUPUOulwMMJ To be unable to sleep.",[213]
"In»HEN (Hill) means “to see with the eyes” and can also be used for “to think
or comprehend” i.e. “to see with the mind”. (See Lesson 13.) It cannot be
used in the common English sense of “to meet”.
If you want to say “I saw him today” meaning “I met him today” you must
use POP “meet” and not HEN.
— 20 —POP (VI11) “to meet” is generally used for “seeing” or “meeting” someone
but not for “going to meet” someone, for which you must use another word
RUP (See Lesson 7. A.4.)
OW ( 101 ) means “to take” but it is not often used alone in this sense. It is
usually combined with MAH “to come” or PY “to go” to mean “bring” or
“take away”.
Double verbs of this nature are a common feature of the Thai language and
will be dealt with more fully in Lesson 20.
You should note however that where there is an object it is placed between
the two verbs. (Examples 3, 15.)
OW also means “want”. You will come across this meaning later.
TEENY (lil'MU) “anywhere” is the same word as you have had in
Lesson 1 meaning “where”.
You are not likely to find that these two different meanings cause you much
trouble.

ASYou may find it difficult at first to pronounce all the syllables of a
polysyllabic word in the correct tone but luckily there are very few words of
more than two syllables where the tonal values of the syllables vary, so that even
if the tone of one or more syllables is not quite correct the combination of
syllables alone will usually distinguish the word without ambiguity. The tone
of each word in the vocabularies is indicated as shown above and the same
system is used for all words in the extended vocabulary at the end of the book
but for clarity and simplicity of printing the tones are not shown in the romanized version of the examples throughout the text.
By far the best way to learn the tones at the beginning is the way a
Thai child does, i.e. by copying a natural Thai speaker, and as this book is
intended to be used with the help of a Thai teacher we recommend you just to
listen to your teacher and try to imitate the way he pronounces the words and
correlate this with the tone indications given in the vocabularies.
In Thai writing the tones are quite clearly indicated by the use of Tone
Marks coupled with a rather complicated set of rules but as the understanding
of these rules depends on a thorough knowledge of the Thai alphabet it is quite
meaningless to discuss them until you have first mastered the alphabet. The full
consideration of the tone rules has therefore been left until lessons 10 to 19.
1. A. 1. (b.) Grammar Notes.
The general arrangement of a simple Thai sentence is Subject-VerbObject as in English.
There are no Articles for use with nouns.
There is no inflection of nouns, pronouns or verbs ; case, gender, number, tense etc. being indicated where considered necessary by the addition of
other words.
Possession may be indicated by adding the word KORNG “of”
“belonging to” in front of the noun or pronoun but this is often omitted.
Plurality if not indicated by the text of the sentence may be indicated
by adding numeral words.
Inanimate objects have no gender and where it is necessary to indicate
gender in relation to animate objects this is usually done by the addition of
extra words.
Adjectives come after the noun they qualify.
— 3 —Affirmative and interrogative sentences are of the same form; the
interrogative sentence being indicated by the addition of an interrogative word,
usually at the end of the sentence.
The word MY expressed in a rising tone at the end of a sentence is probably
the most common interrogative word and denotes a question. Its use is analogous to that of the English word “NG?” as often used by Latin peoples at the
end of a sentence in English to donate a question.
“You will come tomorrow, No?”= Will you come tomorrow? When
an interrogative sentence contains words such as “who”, “why”, “when”,
“where” etc. no other interrogative word is needed.
In colloquial Thai and also to a lesser extent in writing it is customary
to leave out pronouns, prepositions and other words provided that the intention
of the sentence appears to be otherwise adequately expressed. On the other
hand words which have little or no meaning in the context in which they are
being used and are often quite incapable of translation are frequently inserted
in a sentence to make it sound more complete and euphonious.
Words which may be omitted are shown in brackets in the examples.","[17, 18, 19]"

"The Thai language is a “Tonal Language” which means that a word
may have two or more distinct and quite unrelated meanings depending on the
tone in which it is pronounced.
Altogether there are five tones but there is no single word which is
pronounced in all five although there are a number which may be pronounced
in two or three and carry a different meaning in each.
Most newcomers to the language are rather appalled at the apparent
difficulty of the tones but they are not as hard as is generally imagined even for
people with no musical ear.
A great many words in common use take only one tone and even where
a word has two or three tones, each with a different meaning, in most cases the
word you intend to use will be made clear by the context provided you get the
construction of the sentence right even though your tone may not be quite
correct.
The five tones are;
(i). The High Tone.
This, is a uniform tone pitched well above the level of the
speaker’s normal voice and is similar to the tone used in English to denote alarm.

between the various forms of Past and Perfect Tenses.
Although as we have seen in Lesson 7. the use of DY in front of the
verb indicates the past tense, this is usually omitted in conversation and frequently in writing and the adverb of time is relied upon to show that the action
is in the past.
Another way of showing the past tense is to use the word MEU-A
“when” and GORN “before” separated by an adverb of time and in this construction these two words can generally be translated as “ago”.

not”, “whether or not”.

MEU-ANG LOO-ANG is “The Capital City”, another word for which

NUM KAANG (‘UHPU'l) Note the formation of the word “ice” from
NUM “water” and KAANG “hard”.

As will be seen from the following examples, any attempt to adhere to the Thai

clumsy result in English.

CONVERSATION
8. A. 1. Question Words.
In Lesson 1. A. we saw that an interrogative sentence was formed by
adding the interrogative word MY or the words CHY MY at the end of the
sentence.
REU and REU PLOW are two other words which are used in a similar manner.
The distinction between the various forms of question is not easy to make and
in many cases they are used alternatively but we can set out the following broad
principles as a general guide.
MY is generally used for a direct question concerning something in
the present or future.
MY cannot be used in a negative question or in questions where the pronouns
14, 1414 or 11414 are written or implied.
In these cases we must use CHY MY (preferably) or else REU.

and it is unlikely that you will be able to use these words as a Thai would
until you become very accustomed to the language. The proper usage will
come gradually by listening to Thai speakers, but in the meantime you can
get along quite well without trying to use them unless you are sure. Don’t
just use them unless you are fairly sure the usage is correct; they sound rather
silly if used wrongly. We mention them here because you will hear them used
and meet them in reading and should recognise the usage.

This book is an attempt to introduce the Thai language from an
English speaking foreigner’s point of view; to provide a useful vocabulary;
to illustrate the various constructions used in simple sentences and to deal completely with the Thai alphabet and the system of indicating the Tonal Values
of the words; both of which latter aspects are fundamental to the learning of
the language.
The excellent books of Cartwright and Eagling are both long since
out of print and the only other book available at the present time, “Spoken
Thai” by Hass and Subhanka, is designed more for classwork under an experienced teacher than for individual study and makes no attempt to deal with
the Thai written word or the tone rules. Apart from these there are a number
of conversation and phrase books written by Thai which though useful to those
who already know the fundamentals of the language are of little help to the
beginner who wants to know how to make up his own sentences rather than
to learn stock phrases which are seldom exactly what he wants to say.
The books available for those who want to learn to read consist almost
entirely of the elementary readers used in Thai schools which are unsatisfactory
for a foreigner in every way and for anyone requiring more additional reading
matter we would recommend one of the Thai monthly magazines such as “The
English Language” or “Progress”. Both of these are well set up and clearly
printed and contain a large amount of not too difficult reading printed in both
Thai and English.
In the earlier books on Thai for foreigners, as well as in the Ministry
of Education elementary books for use in Thai schools, the tones are dealt with
from the beginning but we have departed from precedent in this respect because
we feel that it is only confusing the issue to try and deal with the tones until you
have acquired something of a vocabulary and can string the words together
into simple sentences.
The usual drill of repeating over and over again in different tones words whose
meaning you do not understand and words which in many cases you will never
use is monotonous in the extreme and tends to make the lessons dull and unattractive for an adult.
In a letter discussing a proposed system of Romanizing the Thai alphabet,
written to the Siam Society in 1912, His Majesty King Rama VI wrote:
“I propose that the tone value of the Siamese consonants might be
ignored altogether
since the context would always make clear
the meaning”and later:
“For similar reasons given above I think it would be best to ignore
all Siamese tone accents”.
Although we do not go all the way with His Majesty in these sentiments, we
do think that a study of the tones should be secondary to the aquisition of a
vocabulary, a knowledge of the Thai alphabet and of the fundamental constructions of the language and hence a discussion of the tones has been left until
about a third of the way through the book. In only relatively few cases will a
wrong tone cause vou to be misunderstood and if this book is used as intended,
with the help of a native born Thai teacher or friend you will find that in the
early stage at least you will,acquire the correct tone far more easily by imitation
than you could possibly do by trying to remember the tone rules which are all
dependant on familiarity with the Thai alphabet.
Since we realise that many people will not want to bother with more
than a superficial study of the language, the book has been arranged so that
both the Thai spelling and the tones rules are separate sections of each lesson
and can be omitted entirely by those who only wish to acquire a vocabulary and
learn the construction of simple sentences enough to be able to talk with their
servants and do their marketing.
Nevertheless we strongly advise anyone who thinks it worth while learning the
language at all to work through the complete lessons since we believe that no
foreigners can learn to speak Thai even reasonably well unless they also master
the Thai alphabet and have at least a working knowledge of the tone rules.
You may not aspire to be able to read a Thai newspaper; and if you do you will
have to go a long way further than this book will take you; but it is not difficult
to learn enough to be able to read street names, public notices, company names
etc. and to be able to work out the pronunciation of a new Thai word from its
spelling. Being able to do this will give you an added interest in the language.
In most languages there are several ways of expressing the same idea
and the one adopted depends to a large extent on the speaker’s education, experience and social environment ; so if your teacher tells you to say something
differently from what we have put down here, make a note of it and follow him.
Similarly when working through the exercises, if you find your way of rendering
an English sentence in Thai is not the same as that given in the book, it does
not follow that you are wrong. Check with your teacher and see if your version
is acceptable or not, and if not, why not. If it is you will gain confidence; if it is
not you will have learned something new about the finer points of Thai constructions and the meaning of Thai words.","[4, 5, 6]"
"REU ( 1 H 0 ) if it comes in the middle of a sentence usually means “or”.

"YOO (t) b ) “to stay”, “to be located at”.
This is also used as a secondary verb but has a rather different meaning
from that when it is used alone.
As a secondary verb it generally indicates that the action is still going
on. (c.f. Lesson 13 A. 1. (a).)POM KOY KOW TEE SATAHNEE

"(Woman speaking)As these two words are “Polite” words indicating respect, they are not
normally used when speaking to sahmlor boys, servants etc. though they should
and probably will be used by them when speaking to you in which case they are
somewhat equivalent to “Sir” or “Madame”.
Under certain circumstances these two words can be used alone and
are equivalent to “Yes” or “I understand” but nevertheless the limitations as to
which sex may use which word still remain. This usage will be dealt with in a
later lesson.
•
We have used these two words in appropriate places in the examples to
these lessons so that you will get used to seeing and hearing and using them,
but which word to use and whether they should be used at all in any
particular sentence depends on your sex and who you consider you are
speaking to.
— 17 —Finally mention should be made of a large group of special words and
phrases known as RAHCHAH SUP which are used by Thai people when referring to or speaking to Royalty and a further group of words used only in reference to or when talking to Buddhist Priests.
It is however beyond the scope of this book to deal further with these highly
complicated and specialized versions of the language.

CONVERSATION.
20. A. 1. Double verbs.
Double verbs are very common in the Thai language and are used in
two different ways.
(a) Two verbs may be used together to denote two separate actions as in
English.
In this case each verb carries its own full meaning and the English translation
can generally be considered as having the word “and” understood between
the two verbs.
If there is an object it comes after the verbs in the normal manner.
POM JA PY YEE-AM NAI LEKI will go and visit Nai Lek.111ioa Dm man
PY_RUP JOTMAI JAHK
PRYSANEEGo and get the mail from
the post office.111fu DnHinuDinliliinim
MAH REE-AN NUNGSEU LEM N E E Come and studv this book.uiiiauviuiaomini
(b) A number of verbs in Thai can be used as adverbs to qualify or amplify
the meaning of the verbs.
In this case the two verbs are often called primary and secondary verbs, and
though this is a convenient nomenclature it is probably better in many cases to
think of the second verb as an adverb.
When two verbs are used in this manner, the object, if any, usually comes
between the primary and secondary or adverbial verb.
Some of the more common secondary verbs are set out below.
MAH “come” and PY “go”
These two words are frequently used as secondary verbs or adverbs
and you have had some examples of this usage already. They indicate that the
action specified by the primary verb takes place toward or away from the speaker
or sortie other designated or implied position.
For instance; if you ring up your soft drink suppliers you can say:
SONG SODAH KOO-AT YY_MAH
Send two dozen large soda
TEE BAHN POM SORNG LO
(come) to my house.","[255, 256]"
"If talking of the future, JA “will” comes between GUMLUNG and
the verb.
KOON GUMLUNG JA SEU What are you going to buy?
A-RY
fl tunicNils:=1100 11You will not find the continuous tense used very much in conversation
as generally the Thai People are not very much concerned about the finer
shades of meaning and see very little difference between “I buy a tomato” and
“I am buying a tomato”. As long as their meaning gets across they are prepared
to take considerable liberties with formal grammar.
Generally speaking you need not use the continuous tense in conversation unless you particularly want to emphasise that the action is actually going
on at this moment.
In the formal written language however this construction is quite common.
— 155 —13. A. 1. (b). The use of WAH d (11)The word WAH may be used either as a verb or as a conjuction.
As a verb it means “to say” but its use in this sense is mainly confined
to certain types of sentences reporting speech.
KOW POOT WAH A-RYWhat does he say?iirmenios'h
<u
KOW BORK MEE KAOU
WAHHe says that the news says. . . .luiusnuu'iiii
The most common use of WAH is as a conjunction introducing a
substantival clause after verbs of mental action such as “believe”, “think”,
“understand”, “promise”, “know”, “say”, “feel”, etc.
In this usage it is similar to the English conjunctions “that”, “whether”, “if” in
similar constructions.

"Note.
When referring to numbers of things or people a special form of construction is used
which includes a ""Classifier"" or Designatory Particle"".
For instance you cannot say "" H e has three houses"" but must say "" H e has houses
three buildings"".
The question of Classifiers and their usage will be dealt with in Lesson 1 0 and until
you reach there you had better be a little careful with numbers.",[46]

refers to a more particular instant of time.

such as “to receive”, “to hear” etc. which almost invariably take DY in front

In other cases the Thai generally prefer to convert the simple past tense into
the past perfect and say “I have come”, “I have eaten”, etc. (See Lesson 9)

TONES
10. B. 1. Introduction to Tones.
Although as has already been mentioned, the best way to learn the
tones correctly is to imitate a natural Thai speaker, you will undoubtedly come
across new words in your reading from time to time or want to look up words
in a Thai dictionary and it is necessary to understand the manner in which tones
are indicated in the written language.
The tone rules are undoubtedly complicated because of the number of factors
involved and it may be mentioned here that a considerable number of otherwise
quite well educated Thai people do not know them.
Although it will be some time before you can be expected to apply these rules
correctly and rapidly, this is an appropriate stage at which to introduce them.","[139, 140]"
"CONVERSATION7. A. 1. The Past Tense; the words DY(Ifl)and PEN(llJU)(a) The Past Tense is usually expressed by using the simple present together
with an adverb of time to denote the past.

“Just now he come”In cases where no adverb of time is used, the past tense may be indicated by
putting the word DY in front of the verb.

"WRITTEN THAI
20. B. IntroductionIf you have studied the Thai spelling of the words given in the previous
vocabularies and the Thai version of the examples in sections A. 5 of the lessons
up to date, you should now be able to pick out a fair number of Thai words
by their look without still having to spell them out and should be at a stage to
start reading some simple Thai passages.
In part B. of this and the following lessons we give short passages in
Thai to give you practice in separating the individual words and to show you
some of the characteristics of the written language which differs fairly considerably from colloquial Thai in the use of more formal words, rather long and complicated constructions and a considerable number of what appear to be redundant words.
These passages have been taken from Ministry of Education readers,
books, magazines and newspapers so as to cover a number of variations tn style
and, though Thai scholars may consider some of them not very good Thai, they
have all been written originally in Thai by Thai people for Thai readers and are
reproduced here exactly as written. We feel that they can be considered as quite
typical of modern Thai usage.
It has not been possible to select passages containing only words that
you have already had in the vocabularies but any new words are given below
each passage together with explanatory notes where considered necessary and
this should help to enlarge your vocabulary. For the tone of any word refer to
the extended vocabulary Appendix 10.
In the English translation following each passage we have endeavoured
to keep as closely as possible to the literal translation of the Thai so as to bring
out the peculiarities of the Thai phraseology even though in many cases this
results in rathet clumsy and laborious English. Paraphrasing into more suitable
English should present no difficulty.
We would recommend that you proceed as follows :
(a) Read through the whole passage once and try to separate the words
and get a general idea of what it is all about.
Look up in the list below each passage the words which are new
to you as you come to them.
— 253 —Do not take any notice of the spaces between words which occur
from time to time. They do not represent sentences and do not
even correspond very well with punctuation and are best neglected.
They do however enable you to tell where one word ends and the
next begins so just be thankful for them.
(b) Now read through the passage again and if necessary a third time
and see if you can write it down in English.
It is unlikely that you will be able to put it into good English
straight away but that does not matter; you can easily tidy it up
once you have worked out the meaning.
(c) If you get really stuck refer to the English translation below but
try not to do this except as a last resort if you cannot work out the
meaning yourself or if you want to check up your own version.
Translation is an art which only comes with practice and requires a
good vocabulary and a certain amount of mental agility but the following hints
may help you in the early stages.
(1) Do not hesitate to neglect any word which appears to be a mere
duplication or a word added to make the sentence more euphonious. You will find a considerable number of comparatively
redundant words used in almost all Thai writing.
(2) Do not hesitate to add a few extra words, particularly pronouns,
prepositions and conjunctions if they appear necessary to make
sense in English. All Thai writing leaves out a number of words
which would be considered essential in English.
(3) If the context appears to demand that a Thai word should have a
meaning different to that which you have been given in the vocabularies, use that meaning tentatively and see if the whole phrase
hangs together.
The meanings of words in any language depend to some extent
on the situations in which they are used and it is possible in vocabularies to give only the most common and general meanings.
— 254 —(4) If you come across a long word or group of words which you
cannot find in your dictionary try to analyse it into its component
words, put them together and see if you can find a roughly corresponding English phrase.
Thai writing is full of rather flowery expressions and idioms and
the translation of many of these requires a good deal of imagination.
flfUfhvi'NQTH'n KOON KAH TAHNG AH-HAHN
fltU “good”,“goodness”fll“value” ¥114 “away”,0THTJ “food”.
The above combination means “Good value in the way of food”.
(5) In reading newspapers particularly be prepared to find many of
the rules you have learned broken or disregarded and also a number
of misprints and unofficial abbreviations.
The editorial standard of most Thai newspapers is not very high
or very consistent.
(6) If at the end of your translation you are still not quite sure of the
exact meaning, do not get worried about this.
The Asian way of thought and expression is very different from
that of the West and as a rule the Asian deals more with general
ideas rather than with exact relationships.
But lest this lead you into the common error of thinking that Thai
is a very inadequate language in all respects, we would commend
for your consideration the words of that Thai scholar and fluent
English speaker M.L. Pin Malakul, sometime Minister of Education, who, in opening a conference of S.E. Asia Language experts
in Bangkok, said;
“Although we have always been grateful for the use of English
as means of communication with people of other nations, each
of us at some time or other must have found it inadequate as a
medium of expression when it comes to discussing elusive and
abstract subjects such as art, literature, refigion and philosophy.”

"Most verbs of motion such as SONG “to send”, KUP “to drive” PAH “to
accompany”, LONG ‘“to descend”, KEUN “to ascend” etc. are followed by
MAH or PY in this way to indicate the direction of motion relative to some
reference position.
As an extension of the above idea, we can, in certain cases, use these
two words to denote direction in time as well as in space.
The distinction here involves the rather philosophical concept of time moving
up from the past to a given instant and then receding into the future.
This is well illustrated in the use of the two expressions DTOR MAH and
DTOR PY, both of which mean “then”, “later on etc.”
When talking about events that have happened we used DTOR MAH because
the sequence of events referred to was considered as moving towards the
speaker’s present, but when talking of the future we use DTOR PY because to
events are considered as receding from the speaker’s present position in time.
The following two idioms will perhaps help to make this concept clearer.

the past).fminuuin
DTOR JAHK NEE PYFrom then on (Referring to
the future).tminulJThere is no satisfactory translation of the word DTOR as used in these
examples and the expressions must be considered as a whole.
There are a few other cases in which PY is used as a secondary verb
in which the implication is by no means entirely clear, but these are idiomatic
expressions and should be learned as such.
