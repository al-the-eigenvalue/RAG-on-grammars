"Negation14.1 Overview of the Negative Marker
The negative morpheme [bíè] is the only means to negate a sentence. The negative marker may
precede a noun, acting as a negative copula. The negative marker may also follow a noun to
indicate lack of something. Verbs are also negated by the same marker preceding the verb. The
tonal effects of the negative marker and its placement in a sentence are discussed in this chapter.
14.2 Word Order in a Negated Clause
The negative marker usually precedes each constituent it negates.

"31914.5.2 Complex Nouns
Compounds are not a productive means of creating new lexical items in Bangime. Two potential
exceptions are shown in (480) to illustrate that the tones are not affected by the negative marker.
The word ‘child’ has a bound or lexicalized diminutive suffix in the singular citation form
[jaambɛ] but emerges as [jaa=ndɛ] in the plural and with [pʷiɛ]. The word [pʷiɛ] refers to a
‘wife’, but when following the root of ‘child’ the stem means ‘girl’. Similarly, when the word
[boro+mbɛ], plural [boro=ndɛ] ‘boy/boys’, follows the root of ‘child’, it means ‘young men’.

noun, with the exception of the dummy noun (481c - d), each noun has a high tone on the final
mora. It appears that the adjective blocks the tone lowering of the negative marker but that the
adjective itself is unaffected.
14.5.3 Summary of the Negative effects on the NP
The negative marker may precede or follow a noun in a NP. When it precedes a noun, it changes
the tone(s) of the noun. If an adjective follows a noun, the tone of the noun is affected. The next
section shows the tonal and segmental effects of the negative marker with a verb.
14.6 Negative Verb Phrase
The TAM categories are simplified in a negated clause. There are only two aspects when the
clause is marked as negative: incompletive and completive. The negative marker [bie] precedes
the verb just as it does a noun. The difference in the incompletive and completive aspects
depends on the verb’s inflectional class and the valency of the verb. Evidence from narratives
shows that the tones in negated clauses follow the opposite pattern as those described for positive
ones. Text XII, Tiga 2.14, 20, 26, shows that the tonal patterns shown for positive clauses is
reversed; the first person is associated with low tone on the verb and high tone on the object.
14.6.1 VC2 Stems
The present tense in both negative and positive clauses has SOV word order. The verb stem is
unsuffixed for inflection, and the verb stem is preceded by the transitive nasal.
In the completive aspect, just as with a positive clause, the word order is SVO. The verb
root is followed by the [–r] suffix. As discussed in Chapter 8, verbs in Class Two take the [–r]
suffix only in the completive aspect. Examples from texts, Chief 1.3, 4 show that when a clause
is in the present tense and the verb takes a direct object, the object directly precedes the verb.","[338, 339, 340]"

The negative marker [bie] serves to negate both a
noun and a verb phrase. The negative particle may precede or follow a noun in a noun phrase,
but it only precedes a verb. In a negated verb phrase, there are two aspects, incompletive and
completive. Transitive verbs in Class Two and Three take the [–r] suffix, or the [–d] allomorph,
in the negative completive aspect. Class Two verbs take the [–r] suffix in the positive
completive aspect as well. Class Three verbs take a nasalized allomorph of the suffix [–r]̃ in the
positive completive aspect and [–d] in the positive incompletive aspect. In the positive forms,
the root without the [–r] suffix only appears in the perfect and perfective. Again, the meaning of
[–r] is ambiguous as to how it relates to the TAM, and polar, category. In a negative completive
sentence, the transitive nasal is deleted before Class Two and Three verbs. There appears to be a
correlation between the number of morae in a negated completive verb and a negated
incompletive verb so that the [–r] suffix and the root vowel correlates with the transitive nasal in
terms of number of morae in the respective stems. With negated intransitive verbs, the
difference in the aspect is tone and/or the [–r] suffix, but no corresponding nasal. The details of
the issue of the morae and timing in the sentence is left to future research.","[346, 347, 348]"

The tones of the noun are not affected when the negative marker follows the noun. The
fact that the negative marker may surface either before or after the noun makes it difficult to
assign to a specific morphological category such as pre or post clitic, prefix or suffix.
14.3 Negative Adjectival Predicate
Adjectives may not stand alone; they require a dummy noun such as ‘thing’ in a positive phrase.
However, a negative adjectival predicate may consist only of the adjective preceded by the
negative marker. As shown above, the negative marker may act as a copula and a negative with
negative existential predicate noun phrases. In (476), we see that the negative marker acts in a
similar manner with adjectives.

the singular (476a), plural (476b), or with two conjoined adjectives (476c). The negative marker
precedes each constituent in the phrase; it cannot negate the entire sentence at the beginning.
14.4 Negative in a Possessive Noun Phrase
In negative possessive noun phrases, the negative precedes the possessive pronoun. The set of
pronouns that was briefly mentioned in §5.2 is used with the negative marker. If a noun is used,
the negative marker precedes the noun, which is followed by the possessive pronoun.
The negative marker precedes the noun in demonstrative phrases, shown in (477).

a.bìè mɛ́

that is not an XThe negative marker either negates the possessive morpheme (477a - b) or both the noun
and the possessive marker (477c). The demonstrative (477d) follows the same pattern as (477c).
14.5 Tonal effects of the Negative on Noun Stems
As with other morphemes which precede a noun, the possessive proclitics and the definite
marker, the negative morpheme changes the tone of the noun.
14.5.1 Simple Nouns
In the words in (478) we see that nouns that end in a high tone in citation form end with a low
tone when following the negative marker [bíè].","[334, 335, 336]"
"321The word order of a negated present tense clause is S-AUX-O-V, just as with the positive
incompletive marker /daw/.
In both tenses, the tone of the verb stem after the negative marker is in most cases low,
although there are exceptions. First person singular examples are shown in (482).

appears when the verb is a negated completive stem. The transitive nasal and the [–r] suffix are322in complementary distribution in negated verb stems, just as was shown for verbs that
reduplicate and take the [–r] suffix.
14.6.2 Timing in the Negative VC2 Stem
The negative verb phrase differs from the positive verb phrase in the behavior of the transitive
nasal. The completive lacks the nasal, and it employs the [–r] suffix on the verb; the present
surfaces with the nasal, but the verb does not have the suffix. The difference between the present
and completive aspects in the negative is one of timing. Each verb phrase contains the exact
same number of syllables and morae, as illustrated in (484).
Negative VC2 Sentences

"23In some Dogon languages, nouns agree in number and animacy with adjectives and
demonstratives, and verbs agree with pronominal-subject categories. In Bangime, there is no
agreement for plural except in complementizer phrases. Also, tonal agreement for subject is
marked on a verb and an object where present. The plural in Bangime is a clitic [=nɛ] ~ [=ndɛ].
The homophonous marker [nɛ] is found as a singular in some Dogon languages, such as Yanda
Dom.
Another difference in the noun phrase is that the tone-lowering found on possessed
nouns, which is widespread among Dogon languages, is not found in Bangime. Although
complex tonal patterns are found in the possessive pronoun-possessed noun paradigms in
Bangime, tone lowering is not one of them. However, a tone-lowering process is triggered by
the definite article in Bangime.
Compounding is a productive means of creating new lexical items in Dogon. While
phrasal forms are common in lieu of one-stem lexical items, compounding as a process for
forming new lexical items is absent in Bangime.
Particularly in verbs, Dogon languages express inflectional and derivational morphology
through the use of multiple suffixes. Therefore, there is a significant difference morphologically
in the formation of verbs in Bangime and in the Dogon languages.
Forms for the word ‘I write’ in two Dogon languages are compared with Bangime in
(11). Shown in the examples, the negative imperfective and negative perfective aspect are
formed through a combination of suffixes in Dogon languages; in Bangime, the only difference
between the two sentences is the tone on the final vowel of the phrase. Note that the word for
‘write’ in each of the languages is similar, suggesting a borrowing if the whole Dogon word,
including the negative marker, is considered.","[42, 43]"

The modifier ‘be uneven’ (216a) is a verb, while the modifier ‘soft’ (216b) is an
adjective. The incompletive particle in the first phrase is used with the verb ‘be uneven’, but the
incompletive particle (216b) is used with the verb ‘say’. A verb is distinguished from an
adjective because the former does not necessitate the nominalizer [kii] and may follow the
particle [daw]. For example the adjective ‘soft’, [kíì dérɛ́b–íɛ̀] ‘it is soft’ but *[daw derɛbɛ].

"32514.6.3 Intransitive Stems with the [–r] Suffix
Among verbs that are suffixed with the [–r] morpheme, few are intransitive, with examples listed
in (486). Intransitive verbs cannot compensate for the loss of the mora in the incompletive
negative stem, as there is no transitive morpheme.

number of morae in the corresponding present and completive sentences must contain equal
numbers. Since the transitive morpheme, a homorganic nasal, must precede the verb in the
present tense forms to follow the correct word order, this takes the place of one mora and thus,
the present tense verb stem deletes a syllable to compensate. Further, the data illustrate that even
if the clause contains an object, the nasal marker remains, showing that it is a true marker of
transitivity and not a pronominal form. The data show that intransitive verb sentences do not
follow the same mora-timing pattern, but the syllables are still of the same number.
14.7 Transitive Verbs
Verbs which do not take the [–r] suffix also do not compensate for the lack of the nasal in the
negative completive aspect stem. In addition to the presence or absence of the transitive nasal,326transitive verbs without the [–r] suffix show a tonal difference. Based on the above conclusion
that the language is mora-timed, the tonal assignment is likely to have a correlation based on the
mora timing as well but this needs further investigation. The verbs in (487) show a pattern of a
high tone on the final mora of the Incompletive stem and a low on the final mora of the
completive aspect stem.

languages, with the form in Bangime (11), show that although the verbs are similar, the
morphology differs. The examples from Jamsay are representative of typical Dogon
morphology. Although negation and aspect are expressed through a portmanteau morpheme in
the Jamsay verb, the stem is composed of three discernible morphemes, two of which are
suffixes. In the sentence from Bangime, there are three separate morphemes, none of which has
affixal properties.Also, the order of the constituents in the Dogon verb stem, person, tense, and
negation, is to follow the verb root, whereas person and negation precede the verb stem in
Bangime. 20 Tone in Dogon is a property of the verb root; although the lexical tone can be
overridden by inflectionally or derivationally-controlled tone overlays. In Bangime, tone is an
inflectional morpheme which interacts with the tone of the verb stem to indicate aspect.","[43, 44]"
"42whether the people have any genetic relation to the Dogon as they claim. In the meantime, the
description of Bangime set out in this dissertation provides the only description of the language
thus far, and may help eventually in solving a greater mystery of the origin of the Dogon
languages as well.
The Dogon language group had been misrepresented as one language (Bendor-Samuel,
Olsen, & White 1989), but current research estimates 18 to 20 separate Dogon languages and
over 60 dialects (Heath 2008; Hochstetler et al. 2004). This diversity and complexity is due to
the Dogon peoples’ geographic inaccessibility; they have until recently been confined to
secluded, sometimes concealed, villages within the rocky Bandiagara escarpment and various
isolated nearby mountains. Although Marcel Griaule, his team members Germaine Dieterlen and
Michel Leiris and his daughter, Geneviève Calame-Griaule, have published studies on a variety
of topics since the 1930s, including the Dogon languages, much of this work is widely criticized
by those who dispute Griaule’s methodology (van Beek 1991). Their generalizations about
Dogon language and culture based on one language do not apply to the rest of the Dogon area.
Even Leiris (n.d.) found Griaule’s badgering of speakers inappropriate and unproductive, leading
to incorrect data. Many of Griaule’s Dogon language consultants have now admitted to playing
games and misleading him. Publications on Dogon languages from Leiris and Calame–Griaule
continue to be criticized for top-down elicitation techniques.
The classification of languages is critical to tracing cultural history and lineage (Blench
2006). The Dogon languages lack certain features, such as a full noun class system, that are
common among languages of the Niger-Congo family, to which the Dogon languages have been
assigned, causing some historical linguists to doubt their common ancestry (Williamson &
Blench 2000). Further, the classification of the Dogon languages has fluctuated between the Gur43or “Voltaic” (Bertho 1953; Greenberg 1963) and Mande (Delafosse 1952) sub-branches, but
since significant links with either remain inconclusive, they are now not linked with any
subgroup (Gordon 2005), which makes determining their history difficult.
1.11 Organization
This dissertation provides a description of aspects of the morphophonology of Bangime. Since
this is the first published description of the language, the first chapter is dedicated to providing
an overview of all aspects of the language in comparison to surrounding languages, particularly
those in the Dogon group since it is among them that the language is spoken. The phonetic
inventory of the features found in the language is covered in 2.1. Chapter 3 illustrates noun
stems and their underlying segmental and autosegmental representations based on their behavior
with accompanying clitics. Nouns are divided into six segmental categories and six tonal
categories. Evidence is inconclusive at this time as to the link between the segmental and
autosegmental categories and there is at least one nominal suffix which has an undetermined
meaning. Known nominal clitics and suffixes are presented in Chapter 4, and pro-clitics follow
in Chapter 5. The tonal interactions between morphemes associated with the noun and nominal
stems are thoroughly discussed. Word-formation processes that go beyond the stem are shown
in 6.1. The main non-affixal word-formation process is the genitive construction. Compounding
is not a means available in the language, thus two nouns are connected with the genitive
morpheme, a nasal which takes the place of the initial consonant of the possessed noun. Genitive
constructions can act as stems semantically in that they may be modified or affixed in a manner
similar to stems. However, the phonology of the genitive construction acts as a phrase. Chapter
7 gives an overview of the modifiers found in the language. Adjectives must modify a noun; an
adjective does not surface in isolation. Quantifiers act in the same way, but a difference lies in a44plural NP as the plural clitic follows the entire NP in the case of an adjective, but follows the
noun and precedes a quantifier. There is only one negative marker, which may precede or follow
an NP. Because the same negative marker negates a verb phrase, it and its tonal effects are
presented in the final chapter, Chapter 14. An unusual attribute of the language is the fact that a
noun as an object in a verb phrase is tonally affected by the subject of the phrase. The person
marking is often not overtly marked but is marked tonally on the object noun. This is presented
in Chapter 13.
The second part of the dissertation covers the verb phrase. Because the tense, aspect, and
mood (TAM) system of the language is complex, it is broken up into three chapters. The verb
root is introduced first in Chapter 8. Verb roots are abstract representations of an underlying
form; a verb stem always emerges with tense, aspect, or mood and person tonal marking. Links
between form and meaning of proposed underlying verb roots illustrate that verbs may have even
more abstract underlying forms which indicate general senses, such as movement or types of
actions. Verb roots are grouped into five basic classes based on the ways the inflectional affixes
affect the verb phonologically and semantically. Chapter 9 presents the verb particles, which,
along with the inflectional categories presented in the previous chapter, specify the tense and
aspect of a sentence. In Chapter 11, the word order for each TAM category is presented. The
derivational categories of verbs are presented in Chapter 9. Some verbs may be reduplicated and
some must surface with an obligatory nominative accusative as an object. These verbs and the
manner in which they appear with other constituents in a sentence are shown in Chapter 12. The
tonal patterns on the verb phrase, the person marking on the verb and object nouns, are shown in
Chapter 14.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"Word Order11.1 Overview of Word Order
The previous chapters showed that the verb stem is inflected for aspect by vowels following
derivational suffixation. The tense or aspect of a clause is indicated by word order and verb
particles. The word order of a clause in Bangime, the placement of the subject, object, and verb,
changes depending on the tense, aspect, or mood of the phrase. The attested word orders in the
language are SVO, SOV, and OSV for untopicalizationed sentences. The incompletive aspects
are usually SVO, the completive aspects SOV, and the future can be expressed with OSV word
order. These word orders are the defaults, or most commonly expressed, for each TAM
category. The table in (348) presents the default word orders with the particle associated with
each TAM category. The verb particles are discussed in detail in the previous chapter

Compare the phrase in (357) with that in (355). Both use the verb [wore] ‘go’ to indicate
motion. The difference lies in the tense of the phrases and therefore the word order. The
sentence above in (325) is in the completive aspect with SVO order, while the one shown in
(357) is SOV; the ‘dummy’ verb [wore] is considered to be part of the auxiliary, so that the
structure is S-AUX-V-O-V.

1.8.3SyntaxIn the syntactic category of Bangime grammar, the attributes of the language which separate it
from the Dogon languages are the word order changes based on the tense, aspect, or mood of the
clause, and the tonal indexing of the subject on the verb and object if present.
As noted above, in some Dogon languages, nouns agree in number and animacy with
adjectives and demonstratives, and verbs agree with pronominal-subject categories. In Bangime,
there is no other form of agreement except that the plural clitic marks both an NP and the relative
complementizer.",[49]
"As with other categories of reduplicants, the tonal melody is commonly high, with
phrase-final lowering (206a, c), but certain words have a different melody (206b). Some
reduplicants copy the root in its entirety (206c), others undergo segmental changes (206a - b).
7.8Syntactic Processes in the Noun PhraseSyntactic processes, such as conjunction and negation, are also found with nouns and adjectives.
7.8.1Conjoined NounsTwo nouns may be conjoined by the particle /daw/. The particle is homophonous with the
incompletive marker and can be used to mean ‘and’ or ‘or’ depending on the context. As with
the incompletive marker, the coordinating conjunction /daw/ has allomorphs [daw ~ naw ~ naa ~
da ~ na]. Examples are shown of the coordinating conjunction in sentences shown in (207) (209), and the subordinating conjunction in (210) - (213).

"23910.2 Perfective Aspect
The simplest form of a sentence is tentatively glossed as the perfective aspect. The perfective is
expressed solely by the verb stem and the placement of constituents within the phrase, without
TAM auxiliaries.
n déɛ́
déɛ̀
.
1.S millet seed cultivate
I have cultivated.
The verb /de/ ‘cultivate’ is a VC2 stem (Chapter 8) and takes ‘millet seed’ as an
obligatory object (290). Certain verbs, such as /de/ ‘cultivate’, shown in Chapter 12, require a
cognate accusative i.e. a noun derived from the verb. The perfective word order is SVO.
Illustrated in Chapter 11, the word order of the sentence also changes based on the TAM of the
clause. The reason the gloss of the aspect is tentative is that examples from narratives comparing
the ‘perfective’ to the completive aspect such as Chief 7.2 and 4 make determining the exact
definition difficult. The same verb is used, with the same suffixation on the verb, and may be
even glossed the same. Thus, the term ‘perfective’ and ‘completive’ are used in this dissertation
with the matter of refining the definition left to further research.
10.3 Incompletive Particle /daw/
All incompletive clauses are marked with the particle /daw/. The placement of the particle
within the sentence helps to determine the tense or aspect of the phrase. The incompletive aspect
or incompletive particle has several allomorphs: [n da] ~ [na] [naw] ~ [na] and [daw] ~ [da].
The incompletive particle allomorphy is based on the subject of the sentence so that /na/
becomes [da] after the non-second person nasal as in examples, [n da noo] ‘I am coming’, [a na
noo] ‘you are coming’, but there are exceptions.","[258, 259]"
"83precedes a noun which begins with an initial nasal-nasal sequence, the initial nasal deletes.
Otherwise, the syllabicity of the noun stem is unaffected. Since none of these morphemes affect
the syllabicity of the noun stem, none is considered a bound affix. These markers, save for the
genitive nasal, have tones which interact with the noun in the manner shown in Chapter 5.
Associated with verbs are inflectional suffixes, described in Chapter 8, and derivational
suffixes, analyzed in Chapter 9. Verb particles expressing tense, aspect, and mood distinctions,
discussed in Chapter 9, are affected by the subject pronouns tonally and segmentally, but do not
affect the verbs they precede.
As noted, a nasal precedes many nouns and verbs. The first and third person pronouns
may be represented as a nasal preceding objects, verbs or verb particles. The pronoun nasal does
not bear tone independent of the word it precedes. The pronoun nasal does not contribute to the
syllabicity of a noun or a verb; however, it does appear to affect the verb particle in the manner
outlined in Chapter 8. The pronoun nasal is considered to be more closely bound to the verb
particle than it is to content words, nouns and verbs. The transitive marker, also a nasal, is
shown to affect the syllabicity of the verb stem in Chapter 14.

cliticGeneralizations about the SyllableThere is a minimal word constraint in Bangime: a word must have at least two morae.
Disyllabic footing is binary, with most words consisting of a light-light, heavy-light or lightheavy combination. Trisyllabic syllables are limited to one mora per syllable.
The phonotactics of the language determine the available syllable types in Bangime, and
many phonological processes occur at syllable boundaries rather than at morpheme boundaries,
as the language has little affixal morphology.
2.7Summary of FeaturesThe vowel inventory of Bangime consists of seven vowels with length and nasalization being
largely, but not entirely, predictable. Front vowels often combine to make diphthongs. Tense or
[+ATR] mid vowels become lax or [–ATR] before sonorants. Due to the lack of affixal
processes, most phonological effects are seen word-medially at syllable boundaries. Wordinitially, syllable onsets are limited to the less sonorous consonants. Word-internally, or
intervocalically, consonants may be lenited to become more sonorous. Onsetless syllables are
very rare and syllable codas limited to syllable position. Consonants may be pre-nasalized,
nasalized, or labialized. Tone is determined grammatically or by frozen suffixes.","[102, 103, 104]"
"ConclusionBangime is a complex language with an unknown history. The language may have some
shared lexical items with surrounding Dogon languages, but shares little else in terms of
phonology, morphology, and syntax. Bangime has few productive suffixes on nouns. These
include the diminutive and the agentive. The plural is a clitic and the augmentative is a bound
morpheme. The underlying tone on nouns is seen before the plural or the augmentative marker.
The tonal system on nouns can be categorized into six classes or types. There is a tendency for
nouns with more than one syllable to necessitate a change in pitch somewhere in the word so that
monosyllabic nouns may surface with level tones but polysyllabic words may not. Syllable
structure is also restricted so that a minimal word consists of two morae, and a maximal word is
three, light syllables. Most bisyllabic words have either a heavy initial or heavy final syllable,
but not both. Potential vowel harmony processes are neutralized by the laxing of mid vowels
before approximant [r], velar [ɡ], and nasals. Diphthongs often occur in lieu of long vowels and
consist of vowels of different heights or even opposing [ATR] values.
Compounding is not a productive means of creating new lexical items in Bangime.
Instead, genitive constructions, [X's Y], are used in lieu of mono-morphemic lexical items, and
in many cases describe flora and fauna terms.
Adjectives follow the noun they describe. The plural marker is a clitic which then
follows the adjective. The tone of the noun does not influence the adjective, and the plural clitic,
which receives a polar tone, is opposite that of the adjective, not the noun stem. Quantifiers,
however, precede the plural clitic. The definite marker and the possessive pronouns precede the
noun. Both affect the tones on the noun stem and are affected by the noun stem as well. There is330a tendency in the language in general to express the first person tonally as a high tone and the
third person tonally as a low tone.
Verb stems are categorized into five main classes, based on the behavior of the verb root
in the various aspects and tenses in the language. Morphological marking on the verb stem
varies among the classes and includes a suffix [r] which is proposed to indicate efferentiality.
The only productive suffix on the verb is the causative suffix.
Tense, aspect, and mood is indicated in three ways in a clause: (1) the verb stem is
inflected based on its verb class, (2) the placement of the object (if present) varies within the
sentence - SOV for incompletive aspects, and SVO for completive ones, and (3) verb particles or
auxiliaries either precede or follow the verb stem or the object. Bangime also displays the rare
word order OSV in the future tense with an object; this should not be considered the passive
since it is the only way to express the future with an object and there is a separate morpheme and
process to create the passive mood. There is a contrast between the incompletive aspect and the
completive aspect for the markers /daw/ and /kama/ respectively. Further, a contrast exists
between the perfect clitic [kɛ́ɛ̀], for activity verbs and the stative suffix [wɛ], for stative verbs.
Another contrast takes place between a verb stem suffix vowel which is determined through
harmony patterns and a high vowel, although what the vowel signifies is yet to be determined.
The subject of a clause may be expressed through a noun, a pronoun, or tone. Even in the
presence of a subject marker, tone is marked on the verb stem, the particle, and/or the object
noun depending on the tense and the verb involved. There is a tendency again to express the first
persons with high tones, the third persons with low tones, and the second persons with low tones
as well, but the syllable shape of the verb, the object, and the tense of the sentence all affect the
outcome of the placement and the surface distribution of the tones.","[349, 350]"
"26211.4 OSV
The future tense can be formed in two ways: O-S-V-AUX or O-AUX-S-V. The incompletive
particle /daw/ may follow the verb, shown in (360). The object precedes both the subject and the
verb. The other common way of expressing the future when the subject is not a pronoun is to use
a construction which is similar to the passive, shown in (361). The object is phrase-initial with
the verb at the end of the phrase. 51

There is no alternative construction to indicate that a sentence with an object will occur in
the future. The sentence in (361) is not considered to be in the passive mood since the passive
construction differs as shown in the following section.
11.5 Passive
The passive morpheme (362) - (363) is homophonous with the first and third person pronoun
[mi]. The subject is the first constituent in the sentence. The particle which indicates the
passive follows the verb.

The subject of the sentence is tonally marked on the verb and noun. Aside from the lack
of auxiliaries, the sentence in (376) is not marked for tense or aspect in the expected manner.
The perfective aspect is normally formed with SVO word order. The perfective aspect is
distinguished from the completive by the addition of the completive particle following the object
noun but not by word order. However, as illustrated by (377), the default word order of the
perfective aspect is used, that of SVO.

The second clause in (378) is specifically marked by the particle and the high vowel
suffix on the VC4 stem as being perfect. The first clause is perfective. The perfect clitic could
also be seen as marking the entire phrase because the word orders are both SVO. An example of
three verbs being chained together without the use of the chaining particle is Chief 1.2.
The completive aspect default word order is SVO as in the phrases in (379) and (380);
however the object may precede the verb, as shown in (379).","[286, 287]"

kamAnother property of VC5 stems is their tendency to reduplicate. Shown in (246), the
perfective aspect of a VC5 stem is a reduplicated form (246c) of the verb stem. The reduplicated
form of the verb (246c) appears with the [–r] suffix, or with an intervening nasal, but not both,
bearing on the question of timing discussed in Chapter 14. The correspondence between the
nasal and the [–r] suffix is also seen in negative phrases. Examples (246d - e) and the sentences
in (246) show that there is also a correlation between the incompletive marker /daw/ allomorphy
and the nasal, which may appear between reduplicated stems.

In this sentence, the focus is on the place of origin rather than on the motion, as was the
case for the sentences shown thus far.
9.4Nasalization: Place SalientA third verb related to baa and buraa is buun, which has a nasalized vowel. I propose that this
nasalization found on some verb stems, those in Verb Class Three, was once a productive
derivational process that has now become a lexicalized or frozen attribute of those stems. Just as
[baa] and [bu–r–aa] appear to be used interchangeably to mean ‘go away’ in the completive
aspect, the sentences in (263) ostensibly illustrate that [buuⁿ] may be exchanged for [bu–r–aa] in
the perfective aspect. However, note that these two sentences are sequential in the text,
suggesting a subtle semantic difference.

b.n
~2níí
PLbù–r–àà
go away–r–RVdààⁿ .
DaanThey have gone away from Daan. (Chief 7.14 - 15)224Although the speaker provided the same translation in both cases, I propose that a subtle
difference actually exists; while suffix [–r–] appears to place salience on the motion of the
action, nasalization appears to place salience on the place. Although both verbs denote motion
away from a place, the first example (263a) places more salience on place or source of the
motion, (263b) more salience on the motion itself. Thus, in this text, the first sentence could be
translated as, “we came from Daan”, and the second, “we came from Daan”.
The form [buuⁿ] is a Verb Class Three stem, which means that it is suffixed with [–r–] in
the completive aspect, shown in (264).

He [the ancient king] moved away from there. (Chief 3.51)
Whereas both [baa] and [bu–r–aa] can be used in the completive aspect with the same
translation, only the suffixed form of [buuⁿ], [bu–r–̃ a] is used in the completive aspect. The
difference between [bu–r–aa] and [bu–r–̃ a] is that, in addition to the nasalization, a low vowel [a]
often appears as long after [r], but not after nasalized [r].̃
Another difference lies in the use of the imperative. The form [báámà] means ‘go away
from here’, but the imperative of [búúⁿ] means ‘go into’ if both speaker and listener are standing
outside. Additional examples from narratives of [buuⁿ] are Chief 2.2, Tiga 1.9, 11.
9.5Inflectional ParadigmsIn Chapter 8, the inflectional verb category was shown to be predictable in its suffixation
patterns within the TAM categories. I propose that the underlying verb root /bu/ surfaces as
[baa] due to restrictions on high back oral vowels in monosyllabic words. The stem [baa] is the
base to which [–r–] attaches and/or nasalization is applied. Because these processes are no225longer productive, the verb shape determines its inflectional patterns and therefore verb class.
The paradigms for each stem related to [baa] are shown in (265) - (266).

The first sentence (267a) is the imperative form of the verb [mmuⁿ]. When the speaker is
inside, s/he says [múúⁿ] to tell a person to ‘come in’. Because the verb is intransitive, the perfect
aspect is formed with the stative suffix (267b), rather than the perfect particle [kɛ́ɛ̀]. In an
incompletive sentence (267c), the suffix [–r–] is added to the verb root /muⁿ/. The nasalization
from the verb root is spread onto the suffix so that it surfaces as [–r–̃ ].","[242, 243, 244, 245]"

marker. Note that bisyllabic nouns with long final high toned vowels (478g, o) both surface as
low (478p, h). This has consequences for the choice of the tone-bearing unit. Nouns which
surface with all low tones include (478h, l, n), altered from low-high toned nouns (478g, k, m).",[337]

I cultivated (and it’s finished since a long time ago).
Similar to the examples with incompletive particle /daw/, (291) - (292), the cognate
nominative accusative occurred in the sentence which meant ‘I am cultivating’ but not in the
sentence glossed as ‘I cultivate’. The perfect marker may also be used with the presence or
absence of the object with a slightly different meaning. The second sentence was interpreted as
occurring in a time which was further in the past than the first. The verb occurs simply as [deɛ]
in (314), but with the cognate accusative object in (315). This difference seems to be correlated
with the temporal distance.
The perfect clitic appears to be a borrowing from Fulfulde, with the same form and
meaning [kɛ́ɛ̀]. The nasal or [a] alternation which was shown to agree with the person of the
subject of the clause is obligatory before the perfect clitic.
10.4.3 Stative Aspect
Change-of-state and intransitive verbs are marked for the perfect aspect with the suffix [wɛ] or
its allomorph [waj]. Some change-of- state verbs may be marked with the perfect clitic, but no
non-change-of-state verbs may be marked with the stative suffix [wɛ]. Evidence from texts, for
example, Text XII, Tiga 2.8 shows that the stative morpheme is a suffix as it appears directly
after the verb, even if an object is present in the clause. This is true of all tenses and aspects
except the future tense. In the future, the incompletive marker precedes the stative marker. A
list of change-of-state verbs is given in (316).","[266, 267]"

an object (484d) the timing is the same for syllables as well as morae. The examples in (485) of
VC3 verbs illustrate that the deciding factor is morae rather than syllables if the nasal in the
completive aspect stem is considered to be the coda of the first syllable.",[343]
"24010.3.1 Incompletive Aspect
When the incompletive particle /daw/ precedes a verb, the clause is interpreted to be in the
incompletive aspect. In an incompletive clause, the subject is marked by a phrase-initial nasal
for non–second persons, and the transitive nasal marker precedes a transitive verb. The verb
agrees with the subject for person by tonal marking. The inflection on the verb differs for each
verb class; (291) is with a VC2 stem.
n dàá déɛ́
n dèɛ̀
.
1.S INC millet seed 1.S cultivate
I am cultivating.
n dáà n dèɛ́
.
1.S INC T cultivate
I cultivate.
The verb in (259) is not marked with the [–r] suffix, which, in VC2 stems, marks the
completive aspect. Therefore, the particle /daw/ indicates that the clause is in the incompletive
aspect, and the lack of [–r] suffix shows that the verb stem is also in the incompletive aspect.
The presence of the object before the verb indicates that this sentence is in the incompletive
aspect; the lack of it in (292) means that the sentence is in the completive aspect.
Some sentences in the incompletive aspect are ambiguous with respect to time. Temporal
adverbials may be used in order to specify when the event took place. For instance, ‘always’ or
‘every day’ modifies the phrase as being habitual (293).

"24310.3.2 Future Tense
The future tense in a sentence without an object, shown in (305), is formed in with the same
constituents, in the same manner as the incompletive, except that the incompletive particle
follows the verb and invariably [naw]. A transitive verb is preceded by the transitive nasal. The
subject nasal may be differentiated from the transitive nasal when the subject is in the second
person, illustrated above.
n déɛ́
n náẃ .
T cultivate ~2 INC
I will cultivate.
When a sentence in the future tense has an object, the object may be inferred from the
sentence as shown in (306), or the object may surface clause-initially as shown in (307). The
incompletive marker then either follows the verb (306) - (308) or the object (309). Here, word
order is OSV.

When the particle /daa/ is used to mean ‘exist’ it always appears with the postposition
[wi] or [ko]. This expression is not marked for aspect or aspect, it can be used to indicate the
incompletive aspect as shown in the second sentence, the future tense, shown in the first
sentence, or the completive, shown in Chief 1.10.
10.4 Completive
The completive may be differentiated from the incompletive by the auxiliaries either preceding
or following the verb. The completive aspects include the completive aspect, the perfect aspect,
and the stative aspect. The completive aspect particle, like the incompletive aspect particle,
precedes the verb. The perfect and stative aspect morphemes follow the verb stem.
10.4.1 Completive aspect
The completive aspect is marked by the particle /kamaa/ with allomorphs [kaw̃aa] ~ [kɔo]. It
appears to be a grammaticalized form of the verb/adjective/noun meaning ‘become old’,‘older’,
and ‘ancestor’, [kaw̃aa] with root [kɔo] (verbal inflection is discussed above). The completive
aspect marker precedes a verb, which is preceded by the person agreement nasal.","[262, 263, 264]"

1.8.4Greeting SequencesA curiosity in Bangime are the greeting sequences shown in (28), or rather, lack thereof. Most,
if not all, African languages are known for their lengthy call and response greeting sequences.
Bangime has the normal question-type of greetings, but there are few responses which are not
borrowings from Arabic, and many are simply intonational prolongations of the greeting itself.

are curious. Note that, in addition to the relative simplicity of these greetings, there is no
introductory [pòó] or final [tàárè] common to every Dogon language. The one similarity
between the Bangime greeting sequence and those of Dogon languages is the afternoon
introductory greeting [tija], which is also used in the neighboring Dogon language Tiranige.
Thus, the key grammatical aspects of Bangime which separate it from other languages in
the area in which it is spoken in Central-Eastern Mali are (1) disharmonic sequences for the
feature [ATR] tautosyllabically and tautomorphemically, (2) lack of bound morphology, (3)
person agreement marking on objects in the verb phrase, and (4) word order specified by tense.
Among the core vocabulary items, some lexical items bear strong resemblances with Dogon
languages, and consistent sound changes are found between Bangime and potentially related
Dogon words. The Dogon languages themselves vary extensively and lexical correspondences
between Bangime and the Dogon languages are found in a geographically widely distributed
area. Although Bangime is not a Dogon language, I hypothesize that the language had a
connection to, or borrowed from, the Dogon languages at a time when the Dogon languages were
more cohesive. Suggestions as to why the Bangime speakers drew so heavily upon the
vocabulary of Dogon and not the grammar are outlined in the following subsections.
1.9Bangime: ‘a secret language’During the last few months of my second to last fieldwork trip, it became clear that elicited
lexical items were not the same as those used in natural conversation. The elicited items were
often loanwords. These contrast with the periphrastic expressions used in speech. For example,
the word given for ‘fence’ [sáàⁿ], suggests a loan word from Bamana [saaⁿ], but in every day
usage, the phrase [bùrá̃ míndé ɥùrúɡí dóò à ɡòmè màá kɛ́rɛ́], translated as, ‘stick(s) put into the38ground so that people may pass next to the rice’, is employed to describe, in this instance, a fence
surrounding the rice fields. In fact, ‘sáàⁿ’ is unacceptable for any type of fencing if one is
speaking the “true” language. Further examples of so-called “deep Bangime” are shown in (29).

oilThe Bangande language consultants did not inform me of this “deep Bangime” language
until the last two months of fieldwork, after a span of three years on three separate trips. They
claim that the language is a means by which they can speak about others without them
understanding. When outsiders inquire about the language, the Bangande adamantly refuse to
reveal or discuss it.","[55, 56, 57, 58]"
"25
26Tiga 3
Chief 541In Mali, last names are of the upmost importance as they indicate the ethnicity and the
village of a person. Among the Dogon, the last name Dicko is not found. Most Dogon villages
comprise of one last name. While Dicko is the most common last name in Bounou and the other
Bangime-speaking villages, other last names are Bakoro, Baade, Basaga, Basseri, Koulibali,
Konde, Karambe, Guindo, Samasekoro, and Yelkoye.
My hypothesis is that the Fulani enslavers actually captured the Bangande at this time
and renamed them Dicko because slaves took the last name of their owners. To further this
claim, there is no word in the language for last name, the Bangande either borrow the word from
Fulfulde, [jamoore], or say, literally, ‘second name’. 27 Given the importance of last names and
their significance to ethnic identity in Mali, this is highly unusual in this geographic area.
A likely story for the etymology of the name ‘Banaande’ /bànáándɛ̀/ is that the name
derives from ‘Bangande’ /bàŋɡá=ndɛ̀/, nasals and intervocalic velar stops commonly delete in the
language as has been shown. Thus, the people’s true last name is unknown. The only name that
is exclusively used for the Bangande is found among the ‘royal class’ people, ‘Baade’, which
also likely comes from the same source. Certainly, enslavement would give cause for the
Bangande to use a separate language from their captors. A fuller understanding of ‘deep
Bangime’ could reveal the true roots of Bangime among the languages of Africa.
1.10 Conclusion
The classification of Bangime and the Dogon languages as a whole has been unreliable for
several reasons. Based on the lack of lexical and grammatical similarities with Dogon languages
or other languages within Mali or surrounding countries, the classification of the language
remains as an isolate. The task now is to discover from where the language’s speakers came, and27Even the word for ‘name’, [níì], is of interest as it is homophonous with the word for ‘say’.","[60, 61]"

precede the stem are also more closely tied to the stem in that other words may not intervene.
The object follows the verb directly in a perfective construction and the perfective particle
appears clause-finally. The incompletive categories (348a) are usually in SOV order, and the
completed categories are SVO (348b) and the future tense may be either SOV or OSV (319c).
Some verbs may deviate from the default word order to indicate topicalization.
This chapter is organized by word order category: the tense, aspects, and moods which
are expressed through the SVO word order are shown in §11.2. In §11.3, the SOV tense, aspect,
and moods are discussed. Section 11.4 presents the future tense, which is indicated by OSV
word order. The passive mood is indicated by the OSV word order and is mentioned in §11.5.
Then, in §11.6 a brief discussion of the effect of topicalization on word order is presented.
11.2 Subject-Verb-Object
Forms denoting the completive aspects have subject-verb-object as the default word order. The
irrealis mood also has S-V-O word order.
11.2.1 Perfective
Perfective aspect is marked by a verb suffix vowel and occurs with SVO word order, with the
TAM marking and the person tonal marking on the verb. 50 The sentences in (349) - (351) are
representative of the perfective aspect.

The completive aspect is used with a verb which is in the default verb stem in all verb
classes save for Class Two. When there is only one clause, as in (311) above, the root vowel is
suffixed to the verb which follows the completive aspect particle. If there is more than one
clause, as in (312), subordinate clauses may have their own aspects.

Most speakers adamantly prefer one variation of the completive aspect marker to the
other. However, this sample text was given by one speaker, who did vary between [kɔo] (313a b), [kama] (313c - d), and back to [kɔo] again in (313e). Other instances of a speaker using both
forms in a text are Chief 1.14 - 15, Chief 4.6 - 7, Chief 7.8 - 9,
The completive aspect particle may be used in combination with the stative suffix to
indicate the completive aspect for change of state verbs. Examples comparing the completive
aspect with the perfective aspect are found using the verb /baar/ ‘remain’: compare TEXT VI:
Chief 6.17 with TEXT VII: Chief 7.11. Although sentences using the particle [kɔo] are
translated as completive, one example has been found in which the clause was modified by the
temporal adverb ‘now’ (Chief 1.7).
10.4.2 Perfect Aspect
The perfect aspect is marked as [kɛ́ɛ̀] following the verb, which is marked by the presence or, in
this case, absence of suffixation as shown in (314) and (315). As shown below, the default
perfect aspect word order is S–V–O–AUX, with either a nasal or [a] depending on the subject
marked before the perfect clitic.","[264, 265, 266]"
"The future is formed in one of two ways depending on whether or not the sentence has an
object. Even if the verb is transitive, if no object is specified (24a), the word order is subjectverb, followed by the secondary person marking (nasal or low vowel) and the incompletive
particle. If an object is included, the future tense is formed with the object first, followed by the
incompletive particle and the verb.

Western concepts of container and figure. Both [húⁿ] and [ko] may be translated as ‘to’ in (19a b) yet as ‘on’ and ‘with’ in (19c - d), respectively. Further, English ‘to’ is represented with the
postposition [waji] in (19e - f), but as ‘than’ in textual examples such as Chief 1.19. The
example (19c) is of further interest as the verb is clause final; the unmarked tense is normally
object final.
Although at the phrase level Bangime is head initial, with noun-postposition and nounmodifier word order (except DEF N and POSS N), at the clause level, the basic constituent order
depends is either SVO, SOV, or OSV. The ordering of constituents in the sentence depends on
the tense/aspect/mood of the clause. This is highly unusual, with surrounding languages of the
Mande and Dogon language groups all being strict SOV languages and languages of the Atlantic
group, such as Fulfude, being strictly SVO.
Person marking is optionally marked by pronouns, but is obligatorily indexed tonally on
the verb and object when present. As is further elaborated upon in Chapter 13, the first and third
singular person markers have three allomorphs, the morpheme [mi], a nasal, or tone on the verb
and/or object noun, if present.
The perfect aspect requires a non-second person nasal that precedes the perfect clitic,
labeled [~2], in addition to the pronominal subject. It is unclear why the subject is obligatorily
marked before the perfect clitic [kɛ́ɛ̀], unless the marker means ‘finish’ and the sentence is taken
to mean, ‘I drank cream; I finished it’. Second person is a short [a] and second person plural is a
long [aa], both precede the completive morpheme.
The tonal alternations represent tonal agreement for person. The object noun is part of
the tone alternations, which is interpreted to be a single tone contour for verb+object.","[50, 51]"
"1887.8.3Copula and AdjectivesThere are no predicate adjectives; ‘it[noun] is X[adj]’ and ‘a X[adj] X[noun]’ are expressed the same.
An adjective phrase may be ambiguous for tense or aspect, for an example see Chief 1.12. The
verb [wo–re] ‘go’ can be used as a copula with adjectives, as shown in examples in (215).

Another use of [wore] ‘go’ as a conjunction with verbs is found in a narrative, Tiga 3.15.
In most examples, the stem appears in the root form [wo], but Tiga 1.29 represents an example of
the stem with the [–r] suffix. Most adjectives do not use an overt copula. Shown below, verbs
used as adjectives are preceded by the incompletive particle.

ASPECTS OF BANGIME MORPHOLOGY, PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOSYNTAX
This dissertation provides a description of aspects of the phonology, morphology, and
morphosyntax of Bangime. Bangime is a language isolate spoken in the Dogon language
speaking area of Central Eastern Mali. Although the Bangande, the speakers of Bangime, selfidentify with the Dogon, their language bears practically no resemblance to the surrounding
Dogon languages. Bangime has limited productive morphological processes whereas Dogon
languages are agglutinating, with productive morphemes to indicate inflectional and derivational
verbal and nominal processes.
Bangime has a complex tonal system. General tendencies of the tonal patterns are
described, with the many exceptions which frequently occur also outlined. Nominal tonal
melodies are apparent in plural forms. Objects in verb phrases receive tonal agreement with
tones on the verb in accordance with the subject of the sentence.
The tense, aspect, and mood system of the language is also complicated. Inflectional
marking on the verb, auxiliaries, and the word order all contribute to the indication of the tense,
aspect or mood of the sentence. An overview of these multifaceted phonological and
morphological processes is provided in this dissertation with hypotheses as to how the language
might have evolved.

The Human Subjects approval number is #08–13242. All the data included in this study were
recorded using a Marantz PMD660 Professional Portable Digital Recorder with a Shure SM48S–
LC Microphone and were analyzed using the program Praat. Microsoft Excel was used for
plotting vowel formant values and storing lexical items. SIL Fieldworks was used to analyze
texts. Transcriptions are either /phonemic/ or [phonetic] and are written in IPA format. Lexical
items are listed in citation form unless otherwise noted. Long vowels are represented by the
notation {vv}, with tone marked on both vowels of the sequence. Tones are marked with an
acute accent for high {ˊ}, a grave accent for low { ̀}, and a combination for rising { ̌ }.
Morpheme boundaries are indicated with a dash { – } in between morphemes for suffixes and a
equals sign { = } for clitics. The terms root and stem are defined by Aronoff (1994). A
superscript {ⁿ} following a target vowel or approximant is used to represent nasality. When
available, two examples are shown, otherwise the sole example found is shown. TAM markers
are abbreviated and translated. Postpositions have varying meanings which do not translate
directly so PP is used in lieu of a gloss. Hyperlinks are underlined and written in blue
throughout the dissertation which lead to the section mentioned.","[6, 7, 8, 9]"

difference between the present and completive negative verb phrase is the presence of the
transitive nasal or its absence, respectively. To compensate for the deletion of the nasal, the
completive aspect stem adds the [–r] suffix or a combination of the [–r] suffix and an additional
nasal in the stem.",[344]
"Verb Particles10.1 Overview of TAM Particles
In addition to inflectional suffixation based on verb category (shown in the previous two
chapters), the TAM category of a clause is further specified by verb particles. As shown in the
previous chapters, each tense and aspect particle is paired with inflectional marking on the verb
stem, and each verb class has its own set of inflectional patterns. Most verb particles directly
precede the verb except the perfect clitic and the stative suffix. The future marker is an
allomorph of the incompletive, but follows rather than precedes the verb. The verb particles are
listed in (289).

are incompletive (INC), completive (CPL), perfect (PRF) and stative (STAT). The verb moods
are the irrealis (IRR), prohibitive (PROH), and imperative (IMP). Examples of each verb
particle are given in this chapter. The perfective is unmarked by any particles. Because the
incompletive aspects and aspects are all marked with the verb particle /daw/, they are presented
together in §10.3. In §10.4 the completive aspect and completive aspect markers are discussed.
The modal categories are shown in §10.5. The copula is shown in §10.6. In the interest of
descriptive completeness, question particles are presented in §10.7. Most of the examples used
in this chapter involve the verb ‘cultivate’. Supplemental examples are from narratives.",[258]
"25210.5 Mood
The irrealis, imperative, subjunctive, and prohibitional moods are found in Bangime and are each
marked by particles shown in this section.
10.5.1 Irrealis
The irrealis is marked by the particle [ha] and is used with a verb stem in clauses such as ‘I wish
to do X’ or ‘in order to’ as in (328) - (329). Conditional phrases may also use the irrealis marker
in the second clause (330). The hortative (331) may also be marked with the particle [ha].

10.6 Copula
A particle which has arisen in texts but is difficult to elicit seems to act as a copula in some verb
clauses, such as those listed in (334). The copula /maa/ can be used in a manner similar to ‘be’
in English. In the cases elicited, the copula serves as the perfective aspect. However, it has
occurred in texts in other tenses as well. The copula [maa] is used with humans.

The person marker is a nasal (21a, c - d, f) for non-second persons and [a] for second
persons singular (21b) and plural (21e). The nasal or [a] also precedes the second stem of
reduplicated verbs. While a subject pronoun is obligatory, object pronouns may be omitted as
shown throughout Text I: Chief I.
A feature which is not shared by any surrounding language to my knowledge is the use of
tonal marking on the verb and object if present. Subject and TAM are marked by a combination
of segmental and autosegmental features. Shown in sentences (22) - (26), the aspects perfect and
perfective, and completive and incompletive, are marked by inflectional suffixation on the verb
(Chapter 8 - 9), particles (Chapter 10), and the placement of the object in the sentence (Chapter
11). The subject is marked by a nasal or [a], and tone on either the verb, object, or both.
The verb given in the examples /deɡ/ ‘hit’ is a transitive verb in verb Class One. The
perfective is an unmarked aspect in Bangime. The verb receives no inflectional marking other
than the root vowel, and there are no verb particles. The word order for the perfective is SVO.
Verbs in the perfective are not marked with the transitive morpheme, rather, as before the perfect
particle, the verb is preceded by a nasal for non-second persons and [a] for second persons
singular and plural. High tone marks the vowel of the verb stem in the first person and low tone
for third person. When an object is present, it surfaces with a polar tone, the opposite tone, to the
verb.",[53]
"192A phrase which uses the verb ‘have’ (221a) or the agentive morpheme (221b) with the
noun ‘hair’ expresses the object as being ‘hairy’. Additional examples appear in Appendix VIII.
The phrase in (222) illustrates another way to express ‘hairiness’ using the possession.

"4.1Nominal Derivation: SuffixationSuffixes in BangimeAs shown in the previous chapter, the plural and augmentative markers are closely tied to the
noun stem, but do not change the segmental characteristics of a noun stem. The plural marker is
considered a clitic because modifiers may intervene between it and the noun. Morphologically,
the augmentative behaves differently than the plural. For instance when modifiers follow a noun
stem, the augmentative is more tightly bound to the noun stem than the plural clitic since the
augmentative follows the noun directly but the plural follows the modifier. The augmentative
and the plural morphemes, being underlyingly toneless, undergo tone polarity to adopt the tone
opposite to that of the noun root.
Two derivational suffixes have been found in Bangime, the diminutive and its associated
meanings, discussed in §4.2 and the agentive, covered in §4.3. The diminutive suffix has its
own tone(s) which interact with the noun stem. The tone of the agentive is altered by the stem to
which it attaches. The agentive, in most cases, derives nouns from verbs. The morphemes
discussed in this chapter are considered suffixes due to the tonal effects caused and the inability
to insert constituents between the noun and these markers. Also, the diminutive and the agentive
morphemes interact with the segmental contect of the noun root at the morpheme boundary.
4.2DiminutiveThe diminutive suffix [–ɛ] may be attached to most nouns, and indicates that the referent is
‘little’. Three additional suffixes are homophonous with the diminutive suffix. These are a
suffix which derives the name of a language from the people who speak it, an inhabitant of a
village, and a suffix which gives the meaning ‘quality of X’.",[130]

"39Halliday (1976) discusses the concept of “anti-languages”, languages which have been
constructed by “anti-societies” based on the need for secrecy. As mentioned above, the name of
the language and people, ‘Banga’, is literally translated as ‘secret’ by many (although curiously
not neighboring) 24 Dogon peoples, meaning ‘secret language’. Halliday describes anti-languages
as involving either a partial or complete relexicalization of the established language, but that
these languages usually adopt the same grammar with a substituted vocabulary. The substituted
vocabulary pertains to the activities of the anti-society. Kennings, or periphrastic terms like
those shown in (29) above, are very common among this type of language.
Secret or anti-languages are common throughout Africa, even among the Dogon (Lala
2000). “Langues spéciales” have been described for some time in Africa (Van Gennep 1908 in
Moñino 1991). Hudson (1995) specifically notes how secret languages in Ethiopia either
substitute vocabulary or alter syllable structures in order to confuse listeners. The Mau Mau
fighters in Kenya also used metaphors to communicate in a secret language “Uma Uma”, which
in Kikuyu means “get out, get out” (William Kanyi Wamathai, p.c.). Childs (2003) gives further
examples from a secret language used in the Kisi-speaking area of Liberia, known as
“kpélémɛ́íyé” and a possibly related language, “lóndùé”. The latter language is of unknown
origin although the former not only transposes syllables, it also reverses meanings from its source
language. The translation of “kpélémɛ́íyé” is ‘garden leavings’, ‘the few things that are left after
the plants are uprooted’. The meaning, ‘garden scraps tossed away’, is an ironic name as the
language is of high importance to its speakers. The use of opposite meanings is a common
feature of varieties of slang (Eble 1996) and languages spoken by elders in Burkina FasoJamsay [báŋá], Togo Kan [báŋ], Yorno So [bàŋ–íí jéé], Tommo–So [bààŋí–jɛ́], Yanda Dom [bǎn–jɛ́\\bàn–jà–lí],
Ben Tey [bàŋɡì–jí] (see map above for the locations of these languages).
2440(Showalter, p.c.). Both of these techniques are found in “deep Bangime”. For instance, the
names for plants used in ritualistic ceremonies are often based on the opposite of the color of the
bark or flower, i.e. a white barked tree is called, literally, ‘black-eyed’, while the black variety of
the species is ‘white-eyed’. It is here noted that Dogon initiates of the Sigui festival are known
to speak a secret language.
The secret language hypothesis is based on a hierarchical social structure among the
Bangande. As discussed in the introduction, among the estimated 1500 - 3000 speakers of
Bangime, only about a fourth can trace their lineage to the original clan who settled the area.
The others were, and are to this day, enslaved by the royal class within the Bangande and are of
mixed races, ranging from Dogon to Mande, to unknown, as their ancestors were captured by
Fulani and other ethnicities as young children and prevented from knowing from which village
they came so as not to escape. 25
How the slaves came into Bangande society remains a mystery. According to oral
histories, 26 the Fulani enslavers at one point in time attacked a group of the Fulani slave caste,
seeking to capture them. The Fulani slave caste asked the Bangande, who were at that time solely
composed of the royal class, for help. The present-day chief’s grandfather, Giyamo Maamani,
was chief at the time. According to the story, the Bangande clan’s last name was then changed
from Banaande to Dicko as a result of their helping the Fulani slaves overcome the Fulani
enslavers.","[58, 59, 60]"
"8.1Verb TypesIntroduction to Inflectional ClassesThere are 496 verbs in the corpus. Verb roots, like noun roots, do not surface without affixation
and tonal overlays. Most verb roots surface with either an additional vowel to meet the minimal
word requirement of two morae, or with morphological marking in the form of inflectional
suffixes. The tone of the verb stem, discussed in Chapter 13, is determined by the tense/aspect of
the clause, and the subject person marking of the verb phrase. Unlike the tone on noun stems,
the tone on verb stems is not clearly discernible by the affixation or cliticization of elements in
the verb phrase.
The inflectional morphology of the verb stem is based on the syllable shape of the verb
root, i.e., the verb without any suffixes. Verb roots are grouped into five inflectional classes with
the suffixation patterns for each type shown in the table in (234).

Chapter 9, signify the aspect of the clause. The particle /daw/ marks the incompletive aspects:
the present and future tenses. The particle [kɔo] marks the completive tense which does not
naturally occur outside the realm of oral histories and tales. The particles [kɛ́ɛ̀] and [wɛ] indicate
the perfect for an activity verb, and the stative for change-of-state verbs, respectively. The final
vowel of the stem is a high vowel in the perfect and perfective aspect (the latter in Verb Class 4
only) and a copy of the root vowel (which is subject to height harmony as described in §8.2) in
the ‘default verb stem’, that which is used in all other tense and aspects. The [–r] and its
allomorphs [r ̃ ~ d ~ b] may mark purposiveness which occurred in a non-present time and is
discussed in Chapter 9.
This chapter is devoted to giving a description of the different types of verb stems, how
each of the verb classes patterns segmentally, and the affixes which follow each verb stem and
their meanings. Here, I show that the differences in the inflectional patterns on verb stems are
due to the underlying representation of roots. This idea is further developed in the next chapter
where I propose that the form and meaning of the verb roots are related. Each of the following
sections provides examples and lists verb roots for the five categories.
8.2Verb Class One: /CVCvelar/ or /CVr/Verb roots in Class One typically end in a velar consonant. The verb ‘hit’ /deɡ/ is a
representative verb for VC1. The verb root always surfaces with a final vowel so that the
syllable shape of the stem is [CV.CV]. The final vowel (RV) of the verb stem is determined by
the TAM category and the height, backness, and [ATR] value of the root vowel. Verb stems in
Class One are suffixed with either a vowel determined by the root vowel (235a - c) or the vowel200[u], as in (235d). 48 The transitive nasal marker precedes VC1 stems only in the incompletive
(235a) and completive (235b). Examples using the verb ‘hit’ in phrases are shown in (235).

"Intransitive puuⁿ

weed, pull outIn the previous chapter, verb stems were organized into five main classes, largely based on
the patterns of suffixation of an underlying /–r–/ with an unspecified meaning. The suffix [–r–]
is found after vowel-final roots in the completive aspect. A nasalized allomorph [–r–̃ ] occurs
after a root that ends in a nasalized vowel in the incompletive aspect but as [–d–] in the
completive aspect. In roots which end in an alveolar or a bilabial nasal consonant, the222allomorphs [–d–] and [–b–] occur, respectively, in all TAM forms. The [–r–] suffix is not
productive; most verbs in which [–r–] is found do not have stems with unsuffixed counterparts.
9.3[–r–] Suffixation: Motion SalientThere is one verb which does have a basic stem and an [–r–] suffixed stem which can be used
interchangeably, as shown in the sentences in (261).

BongoroThey went away from Bongoro. (Chief map 13.1)
It was shown in §2.2.4 that there are no monosyllabic Bangime words with non-nasalized
high back vowels. Thus, I analyze the stem [baa] as the counterpart of [bu–r–aa]. 49 The same
speaker gave both forms with the same translation, ‘go away from’. While the meaning of [–r–]
is still not completely clear, with further examples shown in this chapter, I propose that the suffix
contributes the meaning ‘salience of motion’. As shown in the sentences in (261), the forms
[baa] and [bu–r–aa] are only interchangeable in the completive and incompletive aspects; in the
perfective, only [bu–r–aa] is used, and neither is used in the perfect.
Another use of the non-suffixed form [baa] ‘go away from’ is [báámà], a coalesced form
of the verb [baa] plus the word [ima] ‘here’, said to children or others to ‘go away from here’.
Further examples of the use of [bu–r–aa] to mean ‘move away from’ are found in Chief 1.5, 13,
Chief 7.8, Chief 7.52, and Tiga 1.1. The meaning of the stem [bu–r–aa] can also be changed to49Historically, this was probably bu-a, which became bwaa > baa.","[241, 242]"
"26611.6.2 Topicalization on Object
When a question is intended to differentiate objects instead of actions, as in (372), the response
in (372) is again the preferred answer, although not the default word order for an incompletive
sentence, that of the subject phrase-initially, followed by the aspect marker, which is in turn
followed by the verb.

11.6.3 Topicalization Changes in other Tenses
Examples of the verb ‘step on’ (374), a verb not marked inflectionally for tense or aspect,
illustrate the word-order variation for additional tenses. The default word order for an
incompletive clause with an object is SOV, as shown in (374) as SOV.

1.S INC T step on
I am stepping on.

1.S INC slither thing T step on
I am stepping on a snake.
The object ‘a slithering thing’, meaning ‘snake’ precedes the verb as expected in an
incompletive clause.
The present tense is also shown to display variable word order in (376). The word order
of the sentence above may not be changed if the aspect is incompletive [*n dáá póɣɔ̀ kɛ́ndɛ̀ kɛ́è].","[285, 286]"
"5language is credited, although Plungian & Tembine (1994) and Calame-Griaule (1956) mention
the language briefly in their overviews of the Dogon languages. In addition, three word lists
have been published: Bertho (1953: 433 - 434) includes an 80 item word list under the language
heading Yɛni, Durieux’s (1988) 100 item list is included in Hochstetler et al. (2004: 99 -105),
and Blench includes an extensive vocabulary list in his summary of the language.
Bangime has been mentioned briefly in the literature under various names, Dyɛni or Yɛni
(a name of one of the Bangime-speaking villages) (Bertho 1953), Numadaw or Numa-daw
(DNAFLA/DRLP 1981; Plungian & Tembine 1994), or Noumandan (Togo 1984) (a part of the
Bobo greeting sequence), 7 Elebo (origin unsure, possibly referring to the word loɓɓo, a Fulfulde
word meaning ‘beautiful’) (Plungian & Tembine 1994), and most commonly, Banger–me,
Bangeri–me, Bangeri me, or Baŋgi Me (Blench 2005, 2007; Calame-Griaule 1956; Hochstetler,
Lee, & Durieux-Boon 2004; Plungian & Tembine 1994). The speakers call their language
[bàŋɡímɛ̀] and find the pronunciation [bàŋɡérímɛ̀] unacceptable. However, similar
pronunciations are found in one text, Chief 5, lines 5, 7.
The term the speakers use to refer to themselves, [baŋɡa], means ‘hidden’, ‘furtive’, or
‘secret’ in many Dogon languages, and the bound suffix [–mɛ], among other things, refers to
languages, in Bangime. The speakers of the language refer to their ethnicity as Bangande
[bàŋɡà=ndɛ́] (the afore referenced [baŋɡa] plus the plural clitic), within the Dogon ethnic group.
I have chosen to use the endonym, Bangime [bàŋɡímɛ̀] 8 written without a space between
‘Bangi’ and ‘me’, to reference the language and Bangande for the speakers of the language. I
translate the name of the language as ‘secret language’ in a combination of Dogon and Bangime.","[24, 25]"
