Their function is both morphological and lencograpbic;
that is to say, they are employed as formative elements for
the purpose of expressing certain grammatical ideas, and they
are also used in the formatton of 'compound) stems(seejI121.,124,156).
In accordance with the ideas which these suffixed
particles indicate they may be divided into the fOllowingfour categories:•(1)3u.ff1xed partiel.es expressing local Idea.s.:calInterrogative suffixed partioles.","[335, 336]"
"Ther·· are. however, other waysand means of distinguishing them rrom the latter elements, fromwhich they differ vastly in two particular respects; first in
reference to. the poal tion they occupy in a complex of words and.
secondly. in regard to the various meanings which the~ imply.
Unlike the suffixed particles, they form no unit whatsoever
with either a preceding or following word, being phonetically•absolutely independent.",[359]
"IntroductoryThe suf1'ixe.d elements discussed in the rollo.ing
sections constltute a characteristic trait of Alsea morphology
and may be best conpared, trom a f'unctional pOint or view,
with the Chinook verbal stems that appear as s.cond elements
of verbal compounds and that express local ideaa. lTheseelements differ vastly from the syntactiC particles (see 99
131-111) in two important respects: First, their position in
relation to the other parts of a sentence is fixed and,•secondly, they oan refer to individual words only and not to
the whole sentence.",[335]
"Hence,they express degrees of certainty and knowledge, emotional
states, connection with preViou.sly expressed ideas, emphasis,
exhortation, comparison, interrogation and concHttonality.

temporal sense, while others are employed for the purpose

Washington. Jacobs used this FTschtenberg typescript for eliciting a large
number of forms fram Mr. Albert. Jacobs' file of such fOTI!l3 is in his
possession and has never been copied by photography. He is having a ~opy
made only of Frachtenberg's old typed grammar. A few of the pencilings on
its pages my be identified as Jacobs' handwriting, especially the scribblings on pages 1 to 3. It is Jacobs' purpose to keep his OW'!! field notes
of Alsea items until that time wben he can decide who is the most suitable
professional linguist to initiate a thorough and up-to-date kind of study
of the language. Boas apparentJ.y inherited the Frachtenberg Alsea typescript. He a:pparently transmitted that inheritance to Jacobs, in 1935.
I would prefer that the definitive study of the language be postponed until
that time when I can determine ,-,pon the ablest and most appropriate scientific linguist Who can then utiliZe both Frachtenberg's and my total
