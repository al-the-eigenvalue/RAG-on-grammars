"7.5.3 Negative subject pronouns
In addition to being marked by negative particles (7.5.2), verbal negation is marked on
Indicative subject pronouns (6.1.2). Negative Indicative pronouns exhibit the CVV shape
which distinguishes Irrealis verb forms, but their tonal value varies: negative Perfective
verb forms are LH, and negative non-Perfective (negated Imperfective and Future) forms
are HL.
Examples of negative Perfective forms are as follows:
mìí
hèè
1SG:PFV.NEG climb:PFVyáI did not climbNEGmìí

in meaning, in place of the equivalent third person negative Perfective pronoun )àá
(6.1.2.5).

"7.5.1 Inventory of negative forms
The following basic inflectional categories have corresponding negative forms:
- basic Perfective
- Pluperfect
- Imperfective
- Future
- Optative
An example of each of the negative forms is found in 7.5.3 below.
There are no negative forms corresponding to the Perfect tense. In the context of
discourse, when a Perfect verb is negated, a negative Perfective form is used (this is
similar to the neutralization of negative “past” and “anterior” forms by many speakers of
Swahili; see Dimmendaal 2000:172–3).

There are two negation particles used with verbs: yá and gá.
The particle yá is used with Indicative (7.4.1) verb forms. It is also found in other
negative constructions. Its use with verbs is illustrated by the following examples:
mìí
1SG:PFV.NEGlàà
eat:PFV)ígà
thingyá
NEG357I did not eat somethingmíì
làà
1SG:NONPFV.NEG eat:VN)ígà
thingyáI am not eating somethingNEGIn terms of nasality, yá is a clitic, since it takes the nasal value of the last syllable of the
preceding morpheme (3.4.3.6).

1SG:PFV.NEG lie.down:PFV NEG
míì
làà
1SG:NONPFV.NEG eat:VNI did not lie downnàmá

in the following examples.

3:OPThèè4zí
climb:OPT-PLgáNEG:OPTNEG:OPTdon’t [you (sg.)] climb! /
you (sg.) mustn’t climb!
don’t let them climb! /
they mustn’t climb!","[374, 375]"
"10.1.2.3 The negative particle yá
Negation is always signalled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some
additional indicator. For negation of an equivalence clause, yá is found in conjunction
with a third person negative non-Perfective pronoun híì (6.1.2.6) in initial subject
position.

3:PFV.NEGyáthe chief is not there / there is no chiefNEGtògó
bethe chief is there / there is a chiefThe negative particle yá is most commonly found with verbs (7.6.1.1.1) and, like the
other Indicative particles, is found clause-finally; the marking of negation in this position
is an areal feature (Watters 2000:207). Here, yá is accompanied by a modification of the
structure of subject pronouns, which mark realis value (see 6.1.2).

1SG walk:VNI am walking / I walkObjects may also be negated: modifications in tonal and segmental structure similar to
those applied to subject pronouns signal that negation concerns an object rather than the
verb or clause. This negation has the effect of focus on the object, and indicates that the
object is different item than the one which the listener expects. In the following cases,
the object’s final syllable is lengthened and a low tone is associated with it.

shapes and tone melodies.
10.1.2.4 The topicalization particle rè
The prototypical use of the particle rè is to strongly topicalize constituents, that is, to
centralize relevant known information in the context of a discourse (cf. 7.6.1.1.1).

Another important use of rè is as a floor-holding device (cf. Payne 1997:358): it shows
that a speaker intends to continue an utterance (cf. the expectancy marker in 4.2.2).

The particle rè is also found with Optative verb forms, where it is used to express mild
supplication (7.6.1.1.2).","[451, 452, 453]"

In some cases, a word or phrase may in itself constitute a complete utterance even though
it does not meet the minimal formal requirements for a clause (i.e., subject plus
predicate). While its significance is bound to the discourse of which is it a part, it is
syntactically independent. Items which typically pattern in this way in Mambay include
interjections, swear words, commands, vocatives and formulae as well as affirmative and
negative markers. The following serve as examples:

In Mambay, clauses are related within a sentence by means of coordination (10.2.1) and
subordination (10.2.2). In the present discussion, a description of clause combinations is
carried out with an emphasis on the morphemes as well as the syntactic structures that
make relations between clauses possible.","[455, 456, 457]"
"7.5.4 Summary of negative verbal forms
Negative verb forms are marked with negation particles (7.5.2) and negative subject
pronouns (7.5.3). These forms are summarized in the following table:

Expanded verb forms allow for functional enrichment of the categories in the basic
inflectional system. While some are formed by means of TAM indicators (7.6.1), others
are formed using possessive constructions (7.6.2) and complex inflectional constructions,
including serial and auxiliary verb constructions (7.6.3).",[377]
"7.4.2.2 Subjunctive constructions with kà
Optative verb forms are also found in subjunctive constructions with the adverbializer kà
‘when, and then’ (10.2.2.2). Semantically, a purpose clause (‘so that, in order to’) results
from the combination of kà and the Optative verb form. The structure of the Optative in
this context is the same as that found in main clauses (7.4.2.1).
Examples of Optative verb forms used with kà are as follows:

7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:356mì pàg4rú

1SG make:VN-3SG.OBJ 3:OPTtè’

)ígà
eat:OPT thingI made him/her/it eat something7.5 Verbal negation
Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"10.1.2.2 The affirmative particle yó
The affirmative particle yó ‘indeed’ has the effect of affirming a clause or putting focus
on an Indicative clause constituent. When it is simply juxtaposed with a noun, a
presentational clause or an answer results.
kwéé yó
Kwe indeedhere is Kwe / it is KweWith the exception of interrogative pronouns (6.2), sentences consisting of a single word
are not permitted; thus, in cases where a noun is used to answer a question—as shown by
the preceding example—it is always accompanied by yó.
The particle yó may also be applied to complete verbless clauses (10.1.3).

Irrealis (i.e., Future) as well as negative Perfective and negative nonPerfective clauses, share a CVV structure; while the tone melody for the
affirmative Indicative Irrealis and negative Perfective pronouns is HL,
that of the negative non-Perfective pronouns is LH.
3. Optative pronouns exhibit an invariable CV structure, whether affirmative
or negative.
These patterns are summarized in the following table:

third person is marked with a zero pronoun with Perfective tenses in Mambay. This is the
only pronoun category which is always unmarked, and it is significant because third
person Perfective forms are by far the most commonly used pronouns in discourse (in
particular, narrative discourse) in Mambay (Anonby 2005:29–32).

VERBS
7VERBSThe Mambay verb system exhibits richness in the types of available verb structures as
well as the functional distinctions represented by combinations of these structures. These
possibilities are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The first major section of this chapter (7.1) introduces verb stems. While some are
canonical and morphologically simple, others are non-canonical and, in some cases,
morphologically complex. Non-canonical verbs result from the application of verbal
extensions, derivation of verbs from other parts of speech, the ideophonic nature of some
verbs, and borrowing of verbs from other languages.
The set of verbal extensions is the most significant way in which verb stems are
composed, and is investigated in detail in 7.2. This set is reminiscent of systems found
elsewhere in Niger-Congo. While some extensions found in Mambay are synchronically
productive, others are not; also, the semantic transparency of verbal extensions varies.
The subsequent section (7.3) examines verb word morphology. Segmental affixes are
dealt with in detail, and the behaviour of tone in verb words is examined. In addition,
verbs are classified with respect to transitivity and tone melody. Irregular verbs are also
considered.
Verbal inflection is explored in 7.4. Specifically, this section treats basic inflectional
categories, which are marked length on subject pronouns and tone on subject pronouns
and verb words. It is shown that a division between Indicative and Optative mood is
fundamental to the verb system, and Indicative verb forms are also distinguished for
realis value and aspect. Negative verb forms, which pattern differently than their
affirmative counterparts, are treated separately in 7.5.
The expansion of verbal inflection by means of TAM indicators, possessive constructions
and complex inflectional constructions (specifically, serial and auxiliary verbs) forms the
substance of the discussion in 7.6. A final section (7.7) discusses composite verbal
expressions and their contribution to the verb lexicon.
Unless it has been otherwise specified, example verbs are given in their basic Perfective
forms (cf. 7.4.1.1.1.1).","[314, 315, 316]"
"360TAM indicators are prototypically found with verbs. The syntactic distribution of each
group is distinctive (and as concerns adverbs, complex), and is discussed in the individual
subsections. The examples in the following subsections show that while TAM indicators
expressing aspect are found with a wide range of verb forms, those which express
distinctions of mood are often limited to Optative forms.
TAM indicators found with Indicative verbal forms are also attested with verbless clauses
(10.1.3). Representative examples of this are as follows:
- example particle with a verbless clause:
yó ‘indeed, (affirmative particle)’ (10.1.2.2)
Kwéé
yó
(personal name) (affirmative particle)it is Kwécf. an example of its verbal use:

1SG with pregnancymaybe I am pregnant /
I may be pregnantcf. an example of its verbal use:
)àhná
maybemì té’là
1SG walk:VNmaybe I am walking /
I may be walkingSome TAM indicators may be found in combination with other ones; this enriches the
matrix of TAM possibilities greatly. Such combinations are illustrated by the following
examples:
)àhná ‘maybe’ + nà ‘(question particle)’
)àhná
maybemì té’là
nà
1SG walk:VN QMperhaps I am walking…?","[377, 378]"
"10.1.1 Constituent order
In Anonby (2005:8–13), constituent order in Mambay is detailed, and the effects of
changes in order are also examined. In the present study, a basic summary is provided.
In Mambay, the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly
SVO (subject–verb–object).

recipient. Two strategies are available in such situations, and in both cases, the more
salient object in the discourse follows the other object. If the more salient object is a
patient, it simply follows the recipient:
Ø
híí
3:PFV give:PFVmí
sò lá
1SG.OBJ axehe/she/it gave me an axeIf the more salient object is a recipient, it is introduced after the patient with the
preposition yâg ‘to, for.’

3:PFV give:PFVsò lá yâg mí

axe
to 1SG.OBJIn both cases, object pronouns (6.1.3.1) are used for a pronominal recipient.
Subsequent to the SVO complex, the following order is exhibited: directional adverb –
locative (spatial or temporal) adverbial complement – aspectual or descriptive adverbial
complement – particle. Examples which illustrate this ordering are as follows:

complex.

A small number of particles are used in reference to clauses and clause constituents.
(Particles which are used to define relations between clauses are discussed separately in
10.2.2).
Unlike adverbs, which are minimally comprised of a heavy syllable, clause- and clause
constituent-modifying particles uniformly exhibit a light (CV) syllable.
These particles fall into three groups: Indicative particles, Optative particles, and an
attributive copula ká. While Indicative particles are treated in the present section,
Optative particles are described in the chapter on verbs (7.6.1.1.2), and the attributive
copula is described in the context of verbless clauses (10.1.3.2).
Four Indicative particles are found in Mambay:
nà
yó
yá
rè(question particle; see also 4.4.2.3)
(affirmative particle)
(negative particle)
(topicalization particle)Indicative particles are used in reference to clauses as well as clause constituents. Since
the core of a clause is prototypically a verb, applying a particle to a verbal clause is
formally and functionally equivalent to applying it to the verb (see 7.6.1.1 for examples).
In the following section, each of the Indicative particles is shown (whenever attested) in a
verbless clause, with an Indicative verb, and with at least one other clause constituent.
10.1.2.1 The question particle nà
When the question particle nà is juxtaposed with a noun, an interrogative clause results.

In Mambay, the labial-velar stops kp and gb are articulated with a combination of the
egressive pulmonic and ingressive velaric airstreams. Ladefoged (1968:9) catalogues this
type of articulation as one of three ways in which labial-velar stops may be produced, and
describes its articulatory and phonetic qualities in detail. In short, this airstream
mechanism is made by negative pressure in the oral cavity, accomplished by the lowering
of the jaw at the point when both velar and labial closure have been achieved. The
ingressive velaric quality of these stops in Mambay is confirmed by a “popping” sound
which is present upon their release, when air rushes into the oral cavity from both front
and back. This sound is more clearly heard with kp than it is with gb.
2.1.7.3 Ingressive velaric with rear oral release
A variation on the ingressive velaric airstream described above (2.1.7.2) is found in a
“nasal click” used by speakers of Mambay. Like labial-velar stops, it is produced with an
ingressive velaric airstream; however, for the nasal click the ingressive velaric airstream
mechanism is primary, and its release takes place at the back rather than the front of the
mouth.
The nasal click is a paralinguistic utterance used in Mambay as the default means of
communicating agreement or assent. It is typically repeated, especially when a speaker
wants to signal strong agreement. This articulation is used by speakers of many other
languages for an equivalent function; its areal distribution extends to much of northern
Cameroon, southern Chad and likely other adjacent regions. Sang-Yong Lee (pers.
comm. 2003) has suggested that the same clicking sound is also used in south-eastern
dialects of Korean, where it expresses sympathy and condolence. A similar phenomenon
is the “ingressive nasal accompaniment” which occurs with clicks in some Khoisan
languages (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996:102). However, in that context, there is also
a release at the front of the mouth.
Descriptions of this intriguing phenomenon as it occurs in Mambay and other languages
in the region are uncommon in the literature, and those that do exist provide only modest
phonetic detail. For Mundang, Elders depicts the sound as an “injectif uvulaire” (uvular
implosive) (2000:586). He also quotes Lukas (1937:147), who describes its articulation
in Kanuri (a Saharan language of Nigeria) as a postvelar click in which the lips are
closed.
More may be said regarding the articulation of the nasal click in Mambay, some of which
is likely pertinent to its realization in other languages. Visual and auditory observation
reveals that, similar to what happens with the production of labial-velar stops (2.1.7.2),
negative pressure in the oral air chamber is accomplished by the lowering of the jaw
and/or the tongue during velar and labial closure. However, rather than releasing the
negative balance of pressure at the lips, the back of the tongue is dropped. When the
tongue’s seal with the velum is broken, air rushes into a newly unified oropharyngeal
cavity from an open nasal/pharyngeal breathing tract. The resulting sound is a sharp
click with a high-pitched onset and a low, dull reverberation in the oropharyngeal cavity,60and the sound may be heard from the nose as well as through the cheeks. There is no
voicing at any time during the articulation.
The direction of an accompanying pulmonic airstream is irrelevant to the
accomplishment of the articulation; in fact, breathing normally takes place through the
nose throughout the period of articulation. The negative balance of oral air pressure
described in the previous paragraph is compensated for by an increase of air rushing in
though the nose (during incidental inhalation) or an egressive pulmonic airstream (during
incidental exhalation).","[76, 77, 78]"

be-to.herehe/she/it is on the way here7.4 Basic verbal inflection
The basic inflectional categories in Mambay are marked by length and tone on subject
pronouns (6.1.2) and tone on verb words (see 7.3.2.2 as well this section below).
Mambay verb forms may be divided into Indicative (7.4.1) and Optative (7.4.2) moods.
The clear majority of verb forms are Indicative, and are further subdivided according to
realis value, aspect, and tense.8 Optative forms, in contrast, do not reflect these
distinctions. This basic verb system may be schematized as follows:
Functions of basic verbal inflection in Mambay
mood
Indicativerealis value
RealisaspecttensePerfectivePerfective (basic)
Perfect
PluperfectImperfective
IrrealisFutureOptative
Indicative verb forms are used to express events (7.4.1). Optative verb forms, in contrast,
are used to express a speaker’s wishes, to express purpose in dependent clauses, and to
express the effect of causation (7.4.2). Formally, the classification of Indicative vs.
Optative mood corresponds to the use of the negation particles yá and gá (7.5.2)
respectively. In addition, Indicative verb forms are inflected for realis value, aspect, and
tense.
Indicative verb forms are specified for Realis and Irrealis values. In contrast to Optative
forms, which are inherently irrealis and not marked for realis distinction, Indicative
Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) forms are distinguished. Formally, this distinction is
marked on the subject pronoun: Realis pronouns are short (CV), and Irrealis pronouns are
long (CVV) (6.1.2). While Realis forms signal events which have happened or are
happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not
8In the present study, as has been common in the study of Niger-Congo generally, the term “tense” is
understood in a traditional sense: “any one of the different forms or modifications (or word-groups) in the
conjugation of a verb which indicate the different times (past, present, or future) at which the action or
state denoted by it is viewed as happening or existing, and also (by extension) the different nature of such
action or state, as continuing (imperfect) or completed (perfect)” (Oxford English Dictionary online 2007;
cf. Doke 1935:209, Dimmendaal 2000:162 and Crystal 2003:459–60). This differs from the use of the term
in Comrie (1976) and, subsequently, much of the literature (e.g. Lyons 1995:312 ff.), where event sequence
(“tense”) and the internal structure of events (“aspect”) are treated as distinct categories of verb
modification. In Mambay, there is no formal justification for such a distinction.","[355, 356]"

dream of Africa and made it come true; and to Tinaga Parisa and Kyahrimi Nisse, my
hot-blooded little Mambay girls.
The present research on Mambay was conducted for a doctoral programme in the
Department of African Languages and Cultures at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Fieldwork was funded within the context of a language development consultancy jointly
administered by SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon. Authorization for field research was
granted by MINREST (the Ministère de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) of
Cameroon, permit 006/MINREST/B00/D00/D11.
I wish to thank my colleagues at Leiden University for their insight, humour, and
encouragement, in particular Christian Rapold, Maarten Kossmann, and K’es Mulugeta
Seyoum.
I thank my colleagues of SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon, many of whom contributed in
specific ways to the success this research and the enjoyment of our work together: Padeu
Dakouli, Diane Friesen, Marti Giger, Caroline Grant, Jeff Heath, Jérémie Mondy Mégay,
Julien Tchékoua, Bruce Jakeway, Gideon Noussi, Edward and Diane Tong, and Liz
Williams. Discussions on a wide range of linguistic topics with Jim Roberts, Lukas
Neukom and Richard Gravina were constructive. Vaughn and Mary Ohlman helped us
greatly during times of sickness.
I appreciated academic exchange with many other people working in the field.
Assessments of aspects of the present research by Roger Blench, John Esling, Ken Olson,
Cho Jun-Mo and Gordon Tisher were beneficial. In particular, Stefan Elders (deceased)
did all he could to ensure that I was well-prepared for fieldwork on Mambay by
furnishing me with numerous resources which would have been otherwise difficult to
locate, by sharing his own field notes on Mambay, by involving me in his other works-inprogress in the field of Adamawa languages. Paul Eguchi similarly laid the foundation
for the present research through his previous work on Mambay, and encouraged me to
engage in this field of study. I also thank Keith Snider for fostering in me a sense of
wonder and love of language, especially in the areas of phonology and tone, and so for
inspiring me to pursue further studies in African linguistics. His comments on the tone
chapter of the present research were invaluable.iiAu Cameroun, nous avons apprécié l’accueil que nous avons reçu dans chaque secteur.
Nous reconnaissons les administrateurs tels que le préfet de Guider, le sous-préfet de
Guider, le sous-préfet de Figuil et son adjoint. En plus, nous avons apprécié la sécurité
qu’ont pourvue la gendarmerie et le poste de police de Figuil.
D’autres personnes qui ont enrichi notre séjour à Figuil sont nos frères de la congrégation
EFL à Figuil, les pères à la mission catholique de Figuil (en particulier le père Vladislav),
le patron de Figuil Pierre Roca, et le directeur de l’École de Kolléré.
Parmi les Mambay, nous avons connu un accueil chaleureux depuis le premier moment.
En effet, le pays mambay nous est devenu un foyer. Les chefs des villages mambay nous
ont ouvert la porte au peuple : nous nous sommes présentés devant les chefs de Beepahna
(Biparé), Kaakaala (Kakala), Kaakyo’w (Katchéo), Kaaku’ (Kakou), Bisooli (Bissolé) et
Kaaguma (Kagouma), et nous avons reçu leur bénédiction. D’autres chefs nous ont
accueillis depuis leurs sièges.
Arrivés au pays mambay, c’était d’abord chez Swahy Kada Moïse que nous nous sommes
installés. Il nous à considéré comme ses enfants, et pour nos propres enfants il était
dazwa’ ‘grand-père.’ Nous le remercions pour son partage de lui-même et de sa famille.
C’était un grand privilège de pouvoir travailler avec la direction (ancienne et nouvelle)
de COLAMA (Comité de langue mambay) y compris Kam Kaagbungni et Moussa Tao,
et avec ses membres, en particulier Oussoumanou Bouba, Kwe Nathaniel, Koué Agabus,
Bégui Démas et Bouba Robert. J’ai apprécié aussi l’aide de Tao Justin et de Peevina
Salomon dans l’apprentissage de la langue.
Nos voisins à Kaakaala et à Figuil étaient pour nous un support et une grande joie : Saadu
Kami Taw, Younoussa Wouri, Kada Kaakaala, Amina Beezwa’ et sa famille, Adoum
Kami, Barnabas et Tigam Kaakaala, Parna paaru Samson, Napuga, Haman Kaakaala,
Njidda Robert, et les grands parmi les Mambay qui se rassemblèrent saa napuga chez
Kami Koué. En plus, nous étions à l’aise parmi nos frères de l’église à Kaakaala et avec
leur catéchiste.
Je remercie aussi ceux que nous connaissions hors du pays mambay. À N’Djaména, nous
avons eu le plaisir de connaître Oumarou Beïki, Abassi Moustapha, Mohamadou
Maouarmi et tous les membres du Comité des Ressortissants du Canton de Beepahna
(Biparé). À Maroua, Issa Haman et Souahibou Kassala m’ont orienté avec justesse.
C’est à Oussoumanou Bouba que je réserve un remerciement tout particulier. Il est
quelqu’un qui vit selon le proverbe, « Ku’l za’ ah paa bin, muu zyagri i am » ‘Si tu
apprends la danse du pied d’un autre, tu tromperas le tien.’ Cette individualité, ferme et
parfois rigide, lui a permis pourtant de se donner sans vacillation à la promotion de sa
langue pour l’honneur de ses parents et pour l’héritage des ses enfants et de son peuple.
Nous avons connu ensemble une collaboration enrichissante, et j’espère donc que j’ai pu,
en revanche, l’aider à réaliser ses propres aspirations. En ce qui concerne notre
cheminement divergeant, je lui affirme qu’il n’y aura pas un autre comme lui, puisqueiii« Heega hii haa saa fi naale ya » ‘Un couteau ne peut pas rentrer dans le fourreau de
son collègue.’
Finalement, je dis au peuple mambay, ri zoori ro! Nous vous saluons! Kiswa! Nous
vous remercions! Comme « Tuh bom hii marva ya » ‘Un seul bracelet ne fait aucun
bruit,’ que vous vous épanouissiez dans un esprit d’entente mutuelle. La’ fah kaa fuu

For third person singular as well as third person plural pronouns, there is a partial default
vs. impersonal contrast. Whereas default third person pronouns make explicit reference
to a discourse participant, impersonal pronouns are used when a participant is not in view
(i.e., is backgrounded or irrelevant) but the grammatical context still requires a pronoun.
The default vs. impersonal distinction is formalized only for independent pronouns
(6.1.2.1) used as subjects of verbless attributive clauses (cf. 8.4.1) and for possessive
pronouns (6.1.4).
An illustration of this distinction in verbless clauses is as follows:

A marginal generic third person category in Mambay is expressed using the third person
generic pronoun duFg ‘one, they, people.’ This pronoun differs from all other twelve
pronominal person slots in that it is not found with its own distinctive pronoun forms
(i.e., subject, object and possessive); instead, it patterns syntactically like a subject noun
or an emphatic subject pronoun (6.1.5.1), since it is found as the subject in clauses which
are already accompanied by a third person (singular or plural) pronoun. In the following
examples, the generic third person pronoun duFg is compared with the formally similar
emphatic forms of the third person singular and plural:

they, people’), it is never found with Perfective verb forms, which signal events that have
taken place in conjunction with specific subjects (6.1.2.2).

6.1.1.4 Co-reference
In addition to the person-related pronominal categories already catalogued in this section,
Mambay makes use of a system of co-reference with third person pronouns. This system,
which helps users of the language to keep track third person referents, has been described
in Anonby (2005:27–44). In the present section, generalities of co-reference in Mambay
are laid out.
Co-reference pronouns are used to show that a real-world referent is the same as one
which has been previously designated. In contrast to anaphoric demonstratives (9.2.2),
which are used to refer back over longer distances of text, co-reference functions within a
clause.
Although they comprise a single formal set in Mambay, co-reference pronouns are used
in two capacities: reflexive and logophoric (cf. Wiesemann 1986:438, Kutsch Lojenga
2007:143–5). Reflexive co-reference pronouns are used within a simple clause to refer
back to the subject of the clause. They are represented by reflexive object pronouns
(6.1.3.2) and possessive pronouns (6.1.4).

hàh7gí Qîh
3:PFV forget:PFV name:LF)úùrú
3SG.POSShe/she/iti forgot his/her/itsj nameFor their part, logophoric co-reference pronouns in Mambay show that a participant in an
Indicative complement clause refers to the same participant as the subject of the main
clause (cf. Watters 2000:225). Specifically, it is main-clause verbs of “speech, thoughts,
feelings, or general state of consciousness” followed by the complementizer bè (10.2.2.1)
which trigger the use of logophoric pronouns in the complement clause (Clements
1975:141, cf. Hagège 1974:290). When default (non co-reference) pronouns are used in
this context, it signals a switch in pronominal reference. A pair of examples contrasting
the use of logophoric co-reference pronouns with default pronouns is as follows:
logophoric co-reference pronoun:
Ø

byàá

Unlike third person subject pronouns found in Indicative complement clauses, which
exhibit a logophoric/default contrast, those found in Optative complement clauses are
invariable.

Because the domain of logophoric co-reference is within a single main clause (including
embedded complement clauses), referentially identical subjects in juxtaposed main
clauses are marked with a default pronoun.

6.1.1.5 Formal redundancy between categories
Of the thirteen pronominal person slots, five do not share forms with other slots: 1SG,
2SG, 3GEN, 1PL and 2PL. First-and-second person (6.1.1.5.1) and most third person263(6.1.1.5.2) pronouns, in contrast, exhibit partial formal redundancy with other pronouns
in the same group.
6.1.1.5.1 First-and-second (1&2) person pronouns
The distinction between first-and-second person singular vs. plural (6.1.1.1) is absent on
(non-emphatic) verbal subject pronouns (6.1.2). Instead, it is formalized on verbs
through the use of the plurality affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes
(7.3.1.2) with verb stems.

climb:FUT-1&2PL.REFLThis singular vs. plural distinction is, however, marked on all other first-and-second
person pronoun forms (6.1.1.1).
6.1.1.5.2 Third person pronouns
There are two sets of third person pronouns which exhibit partial formal redundancy:
third person singular with third person plural, and third person (sg./pl.) with third person
impersonal (sg./pl.).
Similarly to what happens with first-and-second person pronouns (6.1.1.5.1), a distinction
of plurality is not marked on (non-logophoric) third person verbal subject pronouns;
rather, it is formalized through the use of the inflectional plurality affix 4zí (7.3.1.1)
and/or the third person singular and plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verbs.

(For a discussion of the function of these affixes in plural Future forms, see 7.3.1.2 and
7.4.1.2.1).
The distinction between default and impersonal third person pronouns is formalized only
for independent pronouns and possessive pronouns (6.1.2.1, 6.1.1.2).

3SG.COREF/IMPERS.POSS6.1.2 Subject pronouns
There are seven sets of subject pronouns:
- independent (6.1.2.1);
- Perfective (6.1.2.2);
- Imperfective (6.1.2.3);
- affirmative Indicative Irrealis (Future) (6.1.2.4);
- negative Perfective (6.1.2.6);
- negative non-Perfective (6.1.2.6); and
- Optative (6.1.2.7).
As this list shows, formal diversity among subject pronouns is largely a reflection of
mood, realis value and aspect marking (cf. Wiesemann 1986:x, Burquest 1986:73–80).
Distinctions are conveyed by means of contrastive vowel length, tone, and the patterning
of third person pronouns.
The structure of first and second person subject pronouns is regular. Pronoun forms
which pattern together for the first and second person are 1) Indicative Realis, 2)
Indicative Irrealis and 3) Optative.
1. Indicative Realis pronouns represent independent pronouns, Perfective
tenses and the Imperfective, and exhibit a common CV structure.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"
"7.4.2 Optative
The Optative mood is attested in three contexts. In main clauses, a general Optative
function prevails; prototypically, it communicates an imperative intention (7.4.2.1). It is
also found in subjunctive constructions following the subordinating conjunction kà
(7.4.2.2), and in subjunctive constructions formed with the causative auxiliary pá ‘make,
do’ (7.4.2.3). Negative forms of the Optative are discussed in 7.5.
7.4.2.1 In main clauses
Optative verb forms are most commonly found in main clauses. In this context, a general
Optative function applies, expressing a wish on the part of the speaker.
Typologically, Mambay stands out in that it has no verb form marked specifically for an
imperative function. Instead, Optative verb forms in main clauses prototypically
communicate an imperative intention—the idea that a member or members of an
audience must do something (cf. Bybee 1985:171, Payne 1997:303, Crystal 2003:227,
Palmer 2001:80). Most frequently, this audience is the second person (singular or plural),
and the illocutionary force is that of a command (“you…!, you must….”).
However, in Mambay the audience of a command may also be the first or the third person
(sample descriptions for which an imperative function has been described for all
pronominal persons are Robertson 1934:320–30, Lakoff 1968:172–6; Roberts 1990:369
and Mounce 1994:143–8; cf. also Palmer 2001:81, who discusses the theoretical352implications of such a system). For forms in which the first person is a speaker, orders
are given to oneself (the first person singular) or a group of which one is a part (first
person plural and 1&2 person forms); for the singular, this has the force of resolve (“let
me…,” “I must…”), and for the plural, exhortation (“let us…,” “we must…”),
respectively. For the third person (singular or plural), the Optative expresses the idea that
an audience which is not being directly addressed must do something; this carries an
obligative (“he/she/it must…”) force. For all three persons, the formal expression of
imperative constructions is equivalent; there is no formally discrete second person
conjugation (cf. Dimmendaal 2000:175, Watters 2000:203, who note that in most
languages the subject pronoun is omitted for second person imperatives).
More broadly, Mambay speakers use the Optative to communicate intentions other than
those which are strictly imperative. For example, third person Optative verb forms may
express a jussive (“may he/she/it”) force. Other more specific functions (for example,
suggestion or imploring) are expressed by using TAM indicators in conjunction with the
Optative forms (7.6.1).
Optative verb forms are found with all of the pronominal persons (cf. 6.1.1), and in all
cases a subject pronoun is obligatory. The Optative is structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbOptative pronoun (CV)stem (Optative tone) (+ optional reflexive suffix)ex. mí

7.4.1.1.1.2 Perfect
The Perfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a point
in time contemporaneous with the sequence of events in a discourse (typically the
present). It is structured differently for intransitive and transitive verbs. For intransitive
verbs and detransitivized transitive verbs (7.3.2.1), reflexive suffixes are used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone (see 7.3.2.2.3)) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì hèè4ní
I have climbed
1SG climb:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò hèè4ró
you (pl.) have climbed
2PL climb:PERF-REFL-2PL.REFL343For typical transitive verbs, a Perfect suffix 4rì (7.3.1.3) is used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone) + 4rì
ex. mì làà4rì
1SG eat:PERF-PERF)ígà

2PL eat:PERF-PERF)ígà

stem and a H suffix; * = replacive melody, i.e., dominates the entire verb word; see
7.3.2.2.3.)
Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. As is evident, the tonal nature of
Perfect forms in some tonal classes is complex: while Class 1 (CVX intransitive only)
and Class 2 exhibit a floating H tone on the left boundary of the verb word, some other
Classes (4, transitive only; 5; and 6) exhibit a replacive melody that applies to the Perfect
verb word as a whole. The tonal behaviour of these forms is reviewed in 7.3.2.2.3.
There is no negative form of the Perfect; negated Perfect constructions use negative
perfective forms (7.5.1).
7.4.1.1.1.3 Pluperfect
The Pluperfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a
point in time subsequent to the event but prior to the point of reference in a discourse.
The Pluperfect is found with intransitive verbs as well as transitive verbs that take
reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2). It is typically structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbIndicative pronoun (CV) stem (Pluperfect tone) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì Qáá4ní
I had moved away
1SG move.away:PLUPERF-1SG.REFL
rò Qáá4ró

mì Qáà4ní
I have moved away
1SG move.away:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò Qáà4ró
you (pl.) have moved away
2PL move.away:PERF-2PL.REFL
As is the case with the basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1) and Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2), third person
singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the Perfect are marked with
a zero pronoun.

A distinction between Perfect and Pluperfect exists only for intransitive verbs from tonal
Classes 1 and 2.

discussion.)
Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negated forms of the Pluperfect
are discussed in 7.5.
7.4.1.1.2 Imperfective
The Imperfective is used for events which, in reference to a given point in time, happen
but are not completed. In addition to carrying a generic imperfective meaning, it often
communicates a habitual meaning. Usually the events are anchored in the present, but as
the example at the end of this section shows, they may be expressed as events in the past.
Represented by a single tense, the Imperfective is typically expressed simply by using a
Realis subject pronoun (6.1.2) with a verbal noun (5.9). As is explained in the section on
verbal nouns, a comparable situation is found in the well-known case of Hausa
(Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages such as
Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).","[359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"NEG:OPTcf. its affirmative counterpart:

"339happening. The Future tense (typically; see 7.4.1.2.1) as well as negated forms of
Indicative verbs (7.5) are expressed using Irrealis pronouns (this grouping is defended in
7.4.1.2). All other Indicative verb forms fall under the domain of Realis.
Among Realis verb forms, a distinction is made between Perfective (7.4.1.1.1) and
Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2) aspects. Perfective forms communicate events which have been
completed in reference to a given point in time, and Imperfective forms refer to events
which happen but which have not been completed in reference to a given point in time.
Perfective forms are represented by three distinct tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect and
Pluperfect), but there is only one basic Imperfective tense. The two aspects differ
formally in several respects. First of all, the segmental shape of the Perfective is the verb
stem, but that of the Imperfective is the verbal noun (5.9). Secondly, while the third
person is invariably marked in the Perfective with a zero pronoun, it is marked in the
Imperfective with a segmental pronoun )à whenever there is no nominal subject
(7.4.1.1.2). Thirdly, the negated form of the Perfective is found with a LH pronoun, but
negated Imperfective forms are found with a HL pronoun (7.5.3).
The Optative and the five Indicative tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect, Pluperfect,
Imperfective and Future) are distinguished from one another by contrastive tone melodies
and by the inventory of verbal suffixes which may found with each (7.3.1). The tone
melodies associated with the possible forms of a given verb fall into six tonal sets or
classes (7.3.2.2). If the tone melody is known for the basic Perfective, Perfect and
Future, melodies for the remaining forms can be predicted. Concerning the inventory of
verbal suffixes, reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) are obligatorily found with Perfect and
Pluperfect forms of intransitive verbs, and optionally found with Future and Optative
forms of intransitive verbs. Further, the Perfect forms of transitive verbs always take the
suffix 4rì, and Imperfective forms of transitive verbs must take the dummy object suffix 4
na if there is no explicit object.
An additional minor verb form, a Realis Future, is found uniquely with the verb vè ‘go’
(7.3.3.1.2). It is composed of an Imperfective pronoun and a Future verb stem.
Each of the basic infectional categories is presented in the sections below (7.4.1–7.4.2).
Negative verb forms are considered separately (7.5). Criteria used for distinguishing verb
forms, all of which have been presented in this section, are summarized in the following

Adverbial functions, including those which are locational, are not restricted to
prepositions. In fact, nouns and directional adverbs are more commonly used to express428location (together with direction) than are prepositions. In addition, a number of high
frequency verbs express such information.
In Mambay, there are several types of locational nouns (this is described in greater detail
in 5.13). Most locational nouns pattern like prepositions in that they require a dependent
element to follow when they are used locatively (otherwise, they may stand alone). For
locational nouns, however, the dependent element is a possessor noun or possessive
pronoun rather than a complement (9.3.1).

eye/in.presence:LF sunin the sun (cf. nínù ‘eye, face, life’)nílé
in his/her/its (coref.) presence / in its presence
eye/in.presence:3COREF/IMPERS.POSS.INAL
The locational sense is an extension of the central meaning of a noun (usually a body
part), and there is no structural contrast between the two senses (5.13). There are, in
contrast, no non-locational nouns corresponding to true prepositions. As Hagège
(1975:155–6) points out in the context of the Kebi-Benue languages, these differences are
sufficient to treat locational nouns and prepositions as belonging to separate grammatical
classes.
Remaining locational nouns (5.13) are not derived from corresponding non-locative
nouns but fail to conform to the distributional criteria for prepositions in at least one of
two ways. First, like the locational nouns above, some have discrete linked forms (5.2.2)
and/or may be found with possessor nouns (5.3.2) and possessive pronouns (6.1.4) rather
than complements (as shown in 9.3.1 above).

without any following dependent element. Examples of such nouns are:
fà4gbàh7
kaF’
kuFF’
là íoutside
here (i.e., this place)
there (i.e., that place)
left side429Locational nouns also show minor structural differences from prepositions. For one
thing, a noun’s minimal shape is a heavy syllable (5.1.1.1) rather than a light syllable (cf.
9.3), and may exceed one syllable (5.1.1.1). Also, attested tone melodies of prepositions
are more often than not H or L, unlike the usual HL or LH melody of canonical nouns
(5.1.1.2).
Like prepositions, directional adverbs (8.1.1) are also used to express locative concepts.
However, they differ from prepositions in that they may not themselves take a
complement (cf. 9.3.1), and in that they are always found with a verb.

"Three of the underived numerals ( àtì ‘two,’ tàrnágà ‘seven’ and fwàrnágà ‘eight’)
exhibit contracted forms reminiscent of nouns subjected to a linked noun template
(5.2.2). However, in contrast to the linked noun template, contraction of these numerals
has no grammatical significance. Rather, it is a predictable phenomenon which applies in
non phrase-final position. In each case, the final vowel is dropped and the tone melody
remains stable. Example alternations are as follows:

Of the numerals from one to ten, the short form of ‘nine’ and the long forms of ‘eight,’
‘nine’ and ‘ten’ have been derived. Of these, three of the numbers are derived from
clauses, and one from a noun phrase (in another dialect, it is derived from a prepositional
phrase).
The meanings of component morphemes are semantically transparent, referring to hand
motions used in counting. Dialect differences in the short forms of ‘nine’ stem from use
of contrasting senses of the word syâh (linked form: sêh; see 5.2.2.2.2): ‘hand’ / ‘finger.’
These derived numerals are as follows:

9.1.2.4 Higher numeral values
Words indicating the higher numeral values ‘hundred,’ ‘thousand,’ and ‘million’ have
been borrowed from other languages. These numerals are as follows:
tèèméérè
)ùzìnéérè
gàmbù
mìlyô7hundred (cf. Fulf. teemerre ~ te’merre )
thousand (cf. Fulf. ujineere)
thousand (calque from Fulf.; see below)
million (cf. Fr. million))ùzìnéérè is the more common term for the numeral ‘thousand.’ gàmbù, which is used
primarily but not exclusively for counting money, means both ‘bag’ and ‘thousand.’
While gàmbù does not constitute a lexical borrowing, it is likely a calque from Fulfulde,
which has extended the term booro ‘bag’ to denote ‘one thousand francs’ (Eguchi
1971:164–5, cf. Elders 2000:151).
As is the case with káálà ‘head, ten,’ these higher values act as numerals rather than
nouns in count constructions (Welmers 1973:289). This is demonstrated by the nonapplication of linked noun morphology (cf. 5.2.2) which would be present on the head
noun if the numerals were nouns.

In Mambay, fractions are used to express approximate numeric proportions, and
comparison of whole numerals expresses exact proportions.
The following fractions expressing approximate proportions of nouns have been attested:

half’) for the concept of ‘one quarter’; however, this term has not been accepted by
Mambay speakers in the context of the present research.
Two adverbs are also used to express fractional proportion:

Ordinal nouns are, prototypically, nominalized numerals (9.1.2) which express the place
of a noun within a series. In Mambay, most ordinal nouns are formed by adding the
ordinal suffix 4rì to a numeral. Ordinal nouns range from ‘first’ to ‘tenth’ and also
include the word ‘last.’ They are given here, alongside the numerals to which they
correspond (when relevant):

Except for dâg tômná ‘first’ (9.1.3.1), ordinal nouns are found in head (initial) position
in the noun phrases in which they are found (cf. 5.2, 5.14).","[430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436]"
"A final section provides anChapter 6, which is concerned with pronouns, is an appropriate transition between
chapter 5 on nouns and chapter 7, which is concerned with verbs. While, prototypically,
pronouns take the place of nominal referents, they also play an important role in the
verbal system, where they bear TAM (tense, aspect and mode) distinctions. The larger
part of the chapter is concerned with the basic categories of personal pronouns
distinguished in Mambay: subject, object and possessive pronouns. Each of these
pronoun types also has emphatic forms produced by various strategies. A final section
deals with interrogative pronouns.
Chapter 7 examines verbs. First, canonical morphologically simple stems are examined.
This is followed by a discussion of non-canonical stems, most of which are
morphologically complex; the most prominent group of non-canonical stems contain
verbal extensions. A description of verb word morphology then leads into a discussion of
verbal inflection, which is marked on the verb word, subject pronouns and by means of
expanded verb forms, including those which incorporate auxiliary verbs and TAM
adverbs and particles. A final section describes composite verbal expressions: these are
constructions composed of a verb stem recurrently found with another element (noun,
prepositional phrase, etc.) in the lexicon.
Chapter 8 deals with two classes of modifiers: adverbs and adjectives. Since ideophones
comprise a majority of adverbs as well as adjectives, they are also treated in this chapter
as a parallel topic with major implications for both of these word classes. One striking
trait of ideophones in Mambay is the existence of several derivational ideophonic
templates. Apart from ideophones, directional and TAM adverbs as well as a poorly
defined group of non-ideophonic adjectives are addressed.
Chapter 9 brings together three minor word classes, all of which are closed in the lexicon:
numerals, demonstratives and prepositions. Numerals in particular are morphologically
diverse; a small group of underived numerals is found, but many numerals are derived
from other parts of speech, especially nouns.
Chapter 10 serves to introduce the structure of clauses and clause combinations. The
section on clause structure, which comes first, deals with constituent order, clause and
clause constituent particles and verbless clauses; independent utterances other than
clauses are also considered. The section on clause combinations then concentrates on
strategies of coordination and subordination, giving special attention to conjunctions and
particles.
At the end of this study, a collection of five texts is transcribed and interlinearized. These
texts have been selected from a variety of genres—song, proverb, legend (account of
origins), and fable—in order to illustrate a range of morphological, syntactic and
discourse structures. In addition, there are two appendices: Appendix 1 provides an27inventory of inalienable possession paradigms, and Appendix 2 presents conjugations of
verbal inflection as it patterns with contrastive tonal verb classes.
One theme that is recurrently invoked in the description is that of canonicity.
Phonological structures from some of the word classes fall between two ends of a
continuum: canonical and non-canonical.
Canonical structures belong to the
homogeneous phonological core of the language and represent the vast majority of
structures in the language. However, there are small but persistent groups of marked and
highly varied structures in all of the lexically open word classes; and often, non-canonical
roots exhibit a cluster of uncommon features. The sections which discuss canonicity
reveal that some non-canonical structures, such as nasalized mid vowels (3.1.1), are
attested only a handful of times in the data. Words borrowed from other languages
usually exhibit the same behaviour as other non-canonical items in the same class (e.g.,
5.2.2.3, 7.1.2.3). In later chapters, canonicity is considered in reference to the following
topics:
- geminate consonants (2.1.2.7);
- repetition of consonants within a syllable (2.1.2.8);
- distribution of vowels within morphemes (2.2.2.3);
- syllable weight (2.4.3);
- inventory of nasalized vowels (3.1);
- noun CV structure (5.2.1.1) and tone melody (5.1.1.2);
- noun-to-noun derivation with prefixes (5.1.2.3.1);
- linked form (5.2.2.2) and plurality (5.5.1.1) templates;
- verb stem structure (7.1);
- ideophones (8.2; see also 5.11 and 7.1.2.2); and
- prepositions vs. locational nouns (9.3.3).
The Fulfulde examples given in the text have been verified using SIL (2003) and Noye
(1974), and Hausa examples are from Abraham and Mai Kano (1949) and Maarten
Kossmann (pers. comm. 2007).","[44, 45]"
"1133.4.3.6 Negation particle yá
The particle yá is used in negation (10.1.2.3). In terms of nasality, it functions as a clitic:
whenever it follows any morpheme ending in a nasalized vowel or nasal consonant,
nasality spreads from that morpheme onto the clitic.

Nasality spreads across morpheme boundaries only in the six contexts described above
(3.4.3.1–3.4.3.6). Even within phonological words, the spread of nasality is sensitive to
morphological boundaries (cf. 2.5.1, 4.1.2.2). For example, nasality does not spread
across prefix-noun or other noun-internal boundaries:
prefix-noun boundary (5.1.2.2):
ná4)áà
nà4rúvò
tí4náánì
tí4kà4ràhgúbean leaves

fish sp. (cf. tâw ‘(male proper name),’ nínù ‘eye,’ gáhlà7
‘faceted’)
maize (cf. tórà ‘seed,’ nà4múùrá ‘jinn’)114Conversely, while nasality spreads across the boundary to the negation clitic yá from the
word that precedes it (3.4.3.6), tonal boundaries remain intact in this context. This is
evident in the following example:
múùrá=yá
silt = NEG
(in: mùú kó múùrá=yá you did not see the silt)
If there were no tonal boundary between the two morphemes, the sequence would
constitute a single tonal word múúràyá with a HLH melody, like other HLH words of
the same shape (4.1.2.2). However, this is not the case.
3.4.3.8 Loss of the nasal feature
There are four contexts in which a nasal feature is lost. In the first case, it is lost from a
consonant (3.4.3.8.1), and in the other cases it is lost from a vowel (3.4.3.8.2–3.4.3.8.4).
3.4.3.8.1 The ideophone plural template
In the plural template used with ideophones (8.5.1), the nasal feature is lost from a
consonant. In this context, the consonant Nm is copied to a position immediately before
an oral vowel íì; as a result, its nasality evaporates and it is realized as .

3.4.3.8.2 Plural marking on nouns
When a plural template containing z (5.5.2) applies to a noun ending in a light syllable
with a nasalized vowel, the nasal feature is lost from that syllable. This happens because
when it is preceded by the obstruent z, the short nasalized vowel is deprived of the
minimal domain required for the hosting of nasality (3.4.2).

It appears that when the 1SG inalienable possessive suffix 4í (6.1.4.2) attaches to one of
three obligatorily possessed nouns (5.3.3.2), its nasal feature is lost. As is the case with
plural marking on nouns (3.4.3.8.2), a constraint against a short nasalized vowel after an
obstruent (cf. 3.4.2) is active here.

(see Glossary)The underlying forms of these three nouns have been established with reference to their
shapes throughout the inalienable possession paradigms (see Appendix 1). They may be
historically composed (note the consistent 4zi ending). Still, whatever morphological
complexities may be present, the loss of the suffix’s nasal feature is clear.
An alternative explanation, and one which is ad hoc but admissible, is that the 1SG
inalienable possessive suffix is a floating H tone without segmental support (the deletion
of the excess H tone in )ázì T is discussed in 4.3.1.4).
In the two other examples of nouns ending in an obstruent-V syllable which are found
with inalienable pronominal possession, the suffix 4í retains its nasality.

"10.1.3 Verbless clauses
Verbless clauses (chains) are common in Mambay. Except in the case of interrogative
pronouns, they must contain another element in addition to a noun or noun phrase (6.2,
43610.1.2.2). Verbless clauses are constructed by combining a subject noun phrase
(minimally consisting of a noun or pronoun) with one of the following elements:
- particle (10.1.3.1);
- noun (phrase) (0);
- adjective (10.1.3.3);
- numeral (10.1.3.4); or
- prepositional phrase (10.1.3.5).
The structure and, in some cases, function of each type of construction are considered in
the following subsections.
10.1.3.1 Noun + particle
The simplest verbless clauses are those comprised of a (pro)noun and an Indicative
particle (10.1.2).

"However, a couple of generalIdeophones, sometimes referred to as phonaesthemes (Dimmendaal 2000:183),
distinguish themselves from other morphemes and words primarily in the way that they
refer and mean. They transcend the arbitrary sound-symbol relationship characteristic of
most lexical items and enrich discourse by dramatizing salient real-world phenomena as
they are perceived by users of the language (Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:3): they are
“descriptive of sound, colour, smell, manner, appearance, state, action or intensity…vivid
vocal images or representations of visual, auditory and other sensory or mental
experiences” (Cole 1955:370).
In Mambay, the distinctive structure of ideophones, which often deviates from canonical
structural characteristics of the classes in which they are found (cf. Welmers 1973:462,
Elders 2001:98–100), is generated by these perceptions. As the later sections of the
chapter demonstrate, structural repetition is perhaps the most salient feature to result, and
is an important component of morphological structure as well as derivational processes.
Also, ideophones make significant use of intonation, more so than other words (4.4.1; cf.
Newman 2000:242).
At the level of discourse, ideophones are a basic means of establishing the importance of
an entity or an action. Anonby (2005:15) points out that in Mambay, the simple presence
of an ideophone highlights an element within a discourse; conversely, only important
elements are accompanied by ideophones (this is evident in all of the longer texts found
at the end of this study). This tendency is especially evident in the climax of stories,
where each verb is characteristically accompanied by an ideophone (p. 16). In addition to
its presence, the way in which an ideophone is presented is an important means of
marking emphasis. In particular, this presentation allows the speaker to regulate the
degree of emphasis. For example, the pitch intervals signalling tonal register raising and
lowering (4.4.1) are more drastic with ideophones than with other words. Further,
repetition (e.g. 8.4.2.1.2, 8.5) and lengthening of segments (e.g. 7.1.2.2, 8.5.3), which are
used as a means of echoing real-world phenomena (cf. Doke 1935:118–9, Watters
2000:196), starkly underscore the discourse elements to which the ideophones affected by
these processes relate.
In the present section, methodological issues relating to the description of ideophones are
addressed in further detail. The remainder of the chapter is then devoted to the structural
description of ideophonic adverbs (8.3), adjectives (which appear to be inherently
ideophonic; see 8.4) and a description of derivational issues pertinent to ideophones (8.5).
Ideophonic nouns and verbs are treated elsewhere (5.11 and 7.1.2.2), but the principles
presented in this section are applicable for these morphological subclasses.
Methodological issues
Rather than attempting an exhaustive analysis of ideophones in Mambay, the present
chapter provides a basic descriptive framework for an intricate but indistinctly structured385area of the language. The study of ideophones in Mambay is problematic, and several
methodological comments are in order.
First of all, ideophones are difficult to elicit (cf. Welmers 1973:461). Initially, the
researcher encounters the perception among speakers of a language that since ideophones
are poorly represented in the written languages with which they are familiar, they are
irrelevant as linguistic data. Once this idea has been countered, a deeper issue remains:
the relationship of ideophones to larger texts. A basic function of ideophones is to enrich
texts, and ideophones are inseparable from these texts (Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:3).
Whereas an inevitably small inventory of ideophones based on an French or English
wordlist might suggest that they are peripheral to the language, an examination of natural
speech, including texts such as those found at the end of this study, shows that they are
integral to both the structure and the flavour of discourse (as mentioned in 8.2 above).
Secondly, unlike other morphological classes, usage of ideophones varies considerably
from one person to another, and outside the context of discourse, speakers of the
language are often unable to determine the meaning of ideophones used by people from
other clans or villages (cf. Childs 2001:67–70). In the ideophonic lexicon, both the
words used as well as the meanings of these words are variable among speakers. And
even where people concur on the form and meaning of a given ideophone, they may
differ regarding its admissibility in the various host word classes (adverb, adjective, noun
and verb; see especially 8.5.6). Numerous speakers of Mambay have been involved in
this study of ideophones; however, in order to cope with the complexity of the
information, this chapter relies on data gathered from the researcher’s primary language
assistant.
Thirdly, it is difficult to draw a line between those words in a given class which are
ideophonic and those which are not (Welmers 1973:460). Transparent sound symbolism
and, secondarily, non-canonical structures provide a basis for deciding what is
ideophonic. In the present analysis, such words are used as structural templates for the
comparison of words whose ideophonic qualities are more difficult to establish.
The following example serves as a case in point. As stated above, ideophones dominate
the word classes of adverb and adjective (cf. 8.2, introductory discussion). However,
except in the case of directional adverbs (and to some degree, TAM adverbs), it is
difficult to identify any adverbs or adjectives which are not ideophonic. Quantifiers
(adverbial or adjectival) such as the following might be expected to distinguish
themselves formally from ideophonic qualifiers:
bî’
yâN7
gáb
lôNw
té%éa bit, slowly, almost
halfway (measured horizontally)
halfway (measured vertically)
very, much
completely, all, whole, together386However, in the language these quantifiers exhibit the non-canonical characteristics of
ideophones outlined in the discussion above (e.g., non-canonical structure, repetition and
repeatability, and highly variable intonation).
It is clear that ideophones present some fundamental challenges to morphological
classification. In the following sections, ideophones whose identity is unambiguous
(based on syntactic limitations) provide a structural framework for the consideration of a
given class. However, morphological ambivalence is an important feature of ideophones
in Mambay, and flexibility in class membership is revisited in (8.5.6) below.","[402, 403, 404]"

With disyllabic verbal nouns, morphophonological alternations are complex. If the
verbal noun has two light syllables and the vowel of the first syllable is an exact echo of
the second syllable’s vowel (i.e., V1=V2), the second vowel is deleted when 4zí is added.

alternations—even suppletion. For example, the final syllable of a two-syllable irregular
verbal noun changes to 4rV if the original suffix is 4gV. (This alternation corresponds
the domain of vestigial noun suffixes, which are otherwise opaque. Note also that
historically, the value of the final vowel has often assimilated partially to the stem; see
5.1.3.2 and Anonby 2007b:REF).

The tone of Imperfective forms of intransitive verbs is lexically determined and
unpredictable, because it is the same as that of the irregular verbal noun used in an
Imperfective function (5.9.1.2). Most commonly, it is HL (for Imperfective forms
corresponding to intransitive stems in any tone class; see 5.9.1.2). For transitive verbs,
the tone melody of the verbal noun is uniform within a given tonal class (5.9.1.1).
Examples of Imperfective forms from each of the six tonal classes (separated here for
transitivity) are as follows:349tonal class, v. word tone

Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negative forms of the
Imperfective, which are marked with a HL pronoun, are discussed in 7.5.
An example from the data which shows that an Imperfective may be anchored to past
events in a story line is as follows:

home, [and] sucked (lit. sucks / is sucking) them one by one.
7.4.1.2 Irrealis
Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not happening.
They have in common a CVV subject pronoun shape. Irrealis verb forms are represented
by the Future tense and negated Indicative verb forms. Although this higher-level
grouping could seem like an ad hoc device to account for a coincidental formal match,
Payne (1997:244–5) and Palmer (2001:168–75) state that both future and negative forms
frequently pattern as irrealis in languages that mark this distinction; Roberts (1990) gives
examples of this (see especially p. 378).
While the Future tense is presented in this section, negated Indicative verb forms are
addressed in 7.5.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367]"
"110The only items in the data which do not conform to this pattern are the following two
words (both of which also exhibit non-canonical obstruent voicing suggestive of
morphological complexity; cf. 2.1.3.2):
ràfá’
wátùtáàbrownness
salt, sugar3.4.3 Spread across morpheme boundaries
There are six cases in which nasality spreads across morpheme boundaries:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.between inalienable pronominal suffixes and nouns (3.4.3.1);
between reflexive verb suffixes and verb stems (3.4.3.2);
between nouns and plural affixes (3.4.3.3);
between verb stems and a perfect affix (3.4.3.4);
between Optative verb stems and an appended vowel (3.4.3.5); and
between a phrase-final constituent and a negation clitic (3.4.3.6).","[127, 128]"
"If the interrogative pronoun and question particle are found alone in a clause, or if the
interrogative pronoun is found in clause-final position (e.g. as an object, adverbial
complement, or predicate nominal), the pronoun and question particle form a single
phonological word.

10.2.2.2 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are used to express a range of adverbial information pertaining to a
main clause. Attested functions include time, purpose, concession and condition. The
following adverbializers are used introduce these adverbial clauses:
kà
kò
kóò
má4kì4nàáwhen, if; and then, before, so that, in order to
when, if
even if, whether
while, when, even though (cf. má ‘with, and,’ kì4 ‘place, situation,’
nàá (relativizer))As the subsequent discussion shows, all of the adverbializers are found clause-initially.
The adverbializer kà functions differently depending on where the subordinate clause in
which it occurs is placed. When the subordinate clause comes before the main clause, kà
means ‘when’ (simultaneous time) or ‘if’ (condition). In this position, it is only attested
in the data with Indicative verb forms.

However, when the subordinate clause follows the main clause, kà means ‘and then,
before’ (sequential time; with an Indicative verb form) or ‘so that’ (purpose; with an
Optative verb form).

1SG.IRR eat:FUT firstkà
and.thenmí
mûn
1SG.OPT come:OPT:to.hereI will eat first so that I might come
The adverbializer kò differs from kà in that it is only found in subordinate clauses that
precede the main clause. There, it performs the same function as kà, meaning ‘when’ or
‘if.’
kò
vérgà hûm4lé,

The adverbializer kò is also distinctive in that, unlike kà, it has an emphatic counterpart
kóò ‘even if’ (concession and condition). If kóò is used with more than one coordinated
construction, it carries the sense ‘whether.’

One final adverbializer, which is found before a sentence-initial subordinate clause, is
má4kì4nàá (lit. ‘with-[the]place-that’). It typically means ‘while, when’ (simultaneous
time).","[459, 460, 461]"

Major adverbial functions which could be expressed in other languages with adverbial
clauses are in some cases relegated to adverbial noun and prepositional phrases in
Mambay. This is true of manner, reason and some time constructions:
manner:
mì hûm4ní

I have come running (lit. I have come with running)

10.2.2.3 Relative clauses
Relative clauses, which function as noun modifiers, are uniformly postnominal: they
follow the linked form (5.2.2) of the noun they modify and the invariable relativizer nàá
(cf. 5.14.6).
páà
nàá Ø

Relative clauses in Mambay are versatile: there appear to be few restrictions on the
distribution of TAM in relative clauses, and the antecedent nouns they accompany may
function as their subjects, objects or locative/temporal complements.
First of all, subject relative clauses—those for which the antecedent noun is the subject of
the relative clause—are common (relative clauses are shown in square brackets).

Object relative clauses, that is, those for which the antecedent noun is the object of the
relative clause, are also well-attested. Inanimate objects are typically represented by a
gap within the relative clause.","[461, 462, 463]"
"7.6.3 Complex inflectional constructions
There are two kinds of complex inflectional constructions: serial verb constructions
(7.6.3.1) and verbal constructions formed by means of auxiliaries (7.6.3.2).
7.6.3.1 Serial verb constructions
Two types of serial verb constructions are commonly attested in Mambay: these have
been labelled Realis Future 2 and Imperfective Progressive 2.
Realis Future 2
In Realis Future 2 constructions, two finite verbs are found together, and there is no
independent person marking on the second finite verb (as per the typical serial verb
constructions described in Payne 1997:308).
Structure: various forms of vè ‘go’ + Perfective verb word
mì
1SGvè
go:PFVtè’
walk:PFVI was going to walknà
1&2vè4zí
go:PFV-PLtè’
walk:PFVwe (incl.) were going to walkImperfective Progressive 2
Structure: optional Realis pronoun + tògó ‘be’ (7.3.3.3) + Imperfective
ex. (mì) toFg mì té’là
1SG be 1SG walk:VNI am walking / I am in the
process of walkingThe optional nature of the subject pronoun with tògó ‘be’ shows that two discrete types
of constructions are used to express the Imperfective Progressive 2. When tògó is found
with its own subject pronoun, the Imperfective Progressive 2 is a serial verb construction.
Evidence for its identity as a serial verb construction rather than an instance of juxtaposed
clauses comes from two directions: first, the subject of both tògó ‘be’ (when it is used)
and the subject of the following Imperfective verb form must be identical; and second,369tògó appears in the Imperfective Progressive 2 as toFg, which is its phrase-internal
realization (cf. its phrase-final realization; see 7.3.3.3; also cf. Payne 1997:308–9).
The optional nature of the subject pronoun with tògó ‘be’ suggests that tògó is in the
process of being grammaticalized as a TAM adverb (7.6.1.2) with progressive meaning.
7.6.3.2 Constructions with auxiliaries
A variety of complex inflectional constructions employ auxiliaries, that is, verbs which
are head of the verb phrase but which do not embody the main activity expressed by the
clause (Payne 1997:84). In addition, the examples below show that auxiliaries express a
meaning that is not fully compositional, that is, one which differs from the meaning
found when the same verb does embody a clause’s main activity.
When an auxiliary is used in Mambay, the main activity or state is expressed as an object
or adverbial complement of the auxiliary. Formally, there are two major types of
constructions with auxiliaries: those followed by verbal nouns (7.6.3.2.1), and those
followed by subordinate clauses (7.6.3.2.2).
7.6.3.2.1 Auxiliaries followed by verbal nouns
Most auxiliaries are followed by verbal nouns, which express the central event or state of
a clause. This given, there are three positions in which the verbal noun accompanying an
auxiliary may be found:
1. on its own;
mì
1SG%áá
find:PFVté’là
walk:VNI was able to walk2. prefixed with kì4 ‘place, time, situation’ (5.1.2.4.5);
mì
1SG)èr
get.up:PFVkì4té’là
place:PFX-walk:VNI was just walking3. as a complement of a preposition (cf. 9.3)
mì
1SGtìì
become:PFVmá
withté’là
walk:VNI walk (habitually) /
I walked (habitually)As is evident from the first and second examples here, the distribution of a verbal noun
vs. a verbal noun prefixed with kì4 does not appear to be semantically significant.
However, in most cases a given auxiliary is syntactically limited to one of the two
strategies; the reasons for the choice of one form over another are not clear. Both are
found with intransitive as well as intransitive verbs, so based on transitivity requirements
established elsewhere in the language (7.3.2.1), verbal nouns (with or without kì4) must
be viewed variously as adverbial complements (with intransitive auxiliaries) or objects
(with transitive auxiliaries).
370The inflectional categories expressed by constructions have been organized according to
form and labelled according to their function as follows:
- Habitual
- Potential
- Realis Future 3
- Recent Past
- Past-Imperfective 1
- Future-Imperfective 1
- Past-Imperfective 2
- Future-Imperfective 2
The structure and function of these forms is described below, and a chart summarizing
the structure of all the forms is found at the end of this section.

Usually, as in the above examples, plurality is not marked explicitly on a noun which is
modified by a numeral. However, it may be marked. This occurs more commonly with
human nouns (5.5.1.3).

In addition to their other functions, numbers may also be used in an absolute way. In
contexts which use mathematical operations—for example, school, counting games and
the calculation of money—numbers relate to one another rather than to a syntactic head.
In cases where both short and long forms are found (cf. 9.1), short forms rather than long
forms are used for mathematical operations.

known only to older speakers of the language.","[427, 428, 429]"
"8.4.1 Distribution of adjectives
Adjectives are used in two positions: first, in the dependent position of a noun phrase
(5.14.2); and secondly, as an attributive predicate (10.1.3.3). In this section, both
possibilities are compared with nouns found in an equivalent position. They are also
compared with adverbs which, although they are structurally similar to adjectives, have a
distinct syntactic distribution.
Adjectives are syntactically distinct from nouns, which are also used to express noun
attributes. It is true that in noun phrases, it is not possible to distinguish nouns and
adjectives syntactically (5.14.1, 5.14.2):
noun + adjective:bàh
míz4míz
rain:LF drizzlydrizzly rainnoun + noun:bàh
pâh
rain:LF wetnesswet rainHowever, the difference between adjectives and nouns may be deduced from attributive
predicate constructions: an adjective is juxtaposed with the noun it modifies (10.1.3.3),
but an attributive noun is always connected to the noun it modifies with the copula ká
(10.1.3.2):
adjective:)à
3IMPERSmíz4míz
drizzlynoun:)à
3IMPERSká
ATTRIB391it is drizzly
pâh it is wet
wetnessThe situation is comparable for adjectives and ideophonic adverbs (8.3). Although there
are many structural similarities between these two classes, there are differences in
syntactic distribution. As shown above and repeated in the following examples,
adjectives are found in the dependent position of a noun phrase or in an attributive
predicate.
dependent position:bàh

rain:LF drizzlyattributive predicate: )à

and can only be followed by a particle (10.1.1).

Following a nominal object, adjectives as well as adverbs may be found. If the postobject item in question is an adjective which describes the object, the object displays
linked noun morphology (5.2.2).
tìgín
nâ’
drop:PFV sauce:LFlùr ùg

However, if the item is an adverb, the object lacks this morphology since the adverb
modifies the verb or clause rather than the object.

IDEOhe/she/it dropped the sauce with a clunk
This morphology usually serves to identify the word class of the post-object word, even
when the word in question is an ideophone showing flexibility between adjectival and
adverbial class membership (8.5.6).

However, in cases where the object noun is of a structure whose linked form is identical
to its free (unmarked) form (5.2.2), the distinctiveness of the flexible ideophone as
adjective vs. adverb is neutralized.

In the following subsections, the structure of adjectives is outlined. First, the distinction
between adjective stem and morphologically complex adjective stem is examined in
reference to the structural repetition which is common among adjectives (8.4.2.1).
Adjectival structure is then presented in terms of allowable CV shapes (8.4.2.2) and tonal
melodies (8.4.2.3).
8.4.2.1 Structural repetition
Structural repetition is a pervasive feature of adjectives in Mambay, where it has been
observed only in adjectives with more than one syllable. It is evident in repetition of
segments (8.4.2.1.1) as well as partial and full reduplication (8.4.2.1.2). A review of
these phenomena shows that while co-occurrence patterns and partial reduplication must
be considered inherent to the adjectival root, full reduplication is the result of a
morphological template associated with the root (8.4.2.1.2), even when no derivation may
be identified. Consequently, in the discussion on adjective structure, monomorphemic
adjective stems will be considered separately from morphologically complex adjective
stems.
8.4.2.1.1 Repetition of segments
Repeated segments are found in almost every adjective with more than one syllable. In
the data, for example, vowels within an adjective are overwhelmingly identical.
óró
kpírfí
làr àg
yérkété7deep, far away

round393Formally, the limitation of adjectives to a single vowel place quality is slightly less strict
(since vowels in the adjective may still be unevenly subject to modifications such as
length and pharyngealization). However, it is found with extreme regularity.

shallowIn addition to a consistent vowel place quality, coda consonants within an adjective are
usually identical. The overlapping of these two tendencies means that entire syllable
rhymes are, more often than not, repeated. This could alternatively be viewed as
variation of the onset with a constant rhyme.

Additionally, the composition of three-syllable adjectives in particular reveals repetition
of entire syllables; this brings to mind reduplication of a greater scope than simple
repetition. In most examples of three-syllable adjectives, the final two syllables are
identical.
rùgùgù
vbàhtátá
wágágáslow
strong and healthy
healthy, cool(but cf. kpìmsìrì ‘thick, fat’)
And for typical two-syllable adjectives—including those for which a derivation (8.5) is
not identifiable—it appears that full reduplication has applied, resulting in adjective
stems composed of a single repeated syllable.
kpó’4kpó’
lòr4lòr
pyúú4pyúúdry
shiny with baldness
pointed, sharp
394Several derivational processes (8.5) are available to provide evidence as to whether or not
such words are morphologically complex stems derived from a monosyllabic root. One
derivation in particular, that of ideophonic emphasis (8.5.2), is used here to explore this
question. The intensified forms of the two-syllable CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV adjectives
are as follows:
kpí4kpó’
lì4lòr
pí4pyúúvery dry
very shiny with baldness
very pointed, very sharpIn these forms, only one of the two syllables is used as a source for the derivation.
However, when three-syllable adjectives undergo the same derivation, all segmental
information is preserved:slow

vbàhtátá
wágágáríì4rúgúgú
vbíì4vbáhtátá
wíì4wágágáFurther specifications are needed to accurately delineate these patterns. First, the twosyllable adjective à à ‘shy,’ which is of an uncommon CV.CV shape, is exceptional in
that its emphatic form íì4 á á does not pattern with the typical two-syllable adjectives
above, but with other adjectives, whose segmental information is copied in its entirety.
Second, the single attested four-syllable adjective kírí4kìrì ‘spherical’ does not have a
derived emphatic form; this makes the determination of its morphological composition
problematic. However, since adjectives and ideophonic adverbs undergo some of the
same derivational processes, it is possible to argue that the derivation of an ideophonic
adverb of the same shape (see 8.5.4.2 in particular) provides evidence for a
morphological complexity similar to that of typical two-syllable adjectives.
tégú4tègù
tégú tègù tégúwith head and chin sticking out
back and forth, with head and chin sticking outIn sum, the data presented here suggest that typical two-syllable adjective stems with
identical reduplicated syllables (CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV) are morphologically
complex. In contrast, other stems in which the last two syllables are identical appear to
be morphologically simple stems whose repetition is a function of their ideophonic
identity rather than a morphological process.
8.4.2.2 Allowable CV shapes
Based on the principles outlined in section (8.4.2.1.2) above, allowable shapes for
adjectives are divided into those that consist of morphologically simple stems (8.4.2.2.1),
and those that occur as morphologically complex stems (8.4.2.2.2).","[408, 409, 410, 411, 412]"
"4.4.2 The expectation marker m
The expectation marker (here symbolized as m ) is a non-segmental morpheme which
raises the pitch of a phrase-final mora. Although its phonological identity may initially
seem unclear, evidence suggests that like TRS (4.4.1), it is intonational rather than tonal
(4.4.2.2). It has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which broadly relate
to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization, the signalling of an incomplete utterance, and
rhetorical question marking (4.4.2.3).
4.4.2.1 Phonetic realizations
The expectation marker has the consistent effect of raising the register of a phrase-final
mora. When it links to a L-toned mora, this mora is realized with a high pitch equivalent
to that of an (actual or hypothetical) preceding H-toned mora; and when it links to a Htoned mora, the mora is realized with a super-high pitch several intervals (4.1.1) above
the baseline realization of the H-toned mora.

EXPECTm
EXPECT[kúú]
bushland, …(cf. 4.4.2.3)[nàmh zá]
animal, …(cf. 4.4.2.3)4.4.2.2 Phonological identity
Phonologically, the expectation marker displays behaviour characteristic of both tone and
intonation. Its confinement to a single mora as well as its phonetically consistent effect
on pitch (4.4.2.1) are occurrences one might expect of a tonal element.
However, there is evidence that the expectation marker is essentially intonational. As
the examples in the preceding section show, the expectation marker may attach to and be
realized in words for which each TBU is already associated with a tone.
Because it does not require its own mora to be realized, it is necessary to address the
possibility that the expectation marker might be a replacive tone. However, the mora to
which it links continues to reflect the relative pitch of the underlying tone (the pitch of
raised L is still a consistent interval lower than raised H; see the examples immediately
above and 4.3.2.1). In this respect, the expectation marker functions intonationally rather
than tonally.
4.4.2.3 Pragmatic functions
The expectation marker has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which
broadly relate to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization (cf. 10.1.2.4), floor-holding (cf.
10.1.2.4), and rhetorical question marking (cf. 10.1.2.1). An example of each role is as
follows:148topicalization:

Interestingly, the first two of these three roles overlap with those of the topicalization

following example:

NOUNS
5NOUNSThis chapter is a description of nouns in Mambay. The first major section (5.1) outlines
the morphological structure of nouns. In particular, noun roots are presented in reference
to attested root shapes and allowable tone melodies. Prefixation is then analyzed as a
morphologically salient process involving a mixture of compounding and derivation.
Suffixation, in contrast, is referred to as a primarily derivational process which, although
it has significantly impacted noun structure, is synchronically unproductive and
morphologically indistinct. Reduplication, a minor phenomenon in regard to nouns, is
mentioned briefly.
A second major section (5.2) deals with a basic morphological distinction between free
(unmarked) and linked noun forms. Linked forms, which are subject to various
morphological templates depending on the structure of their free form, are used for head
nouns in most noun phrase constructions. Following this, a section on possessive
constructions (5.3) complements the discussion, since both free and linked forms are used
in this context. The description of possessive constructions, which are the most
important type of noun phrase construction in the language, revolves around three axes.
First of all, a continuum between spontaneous and fixed possession is established. The
issue of optional vs. obligatory possession is then considered. The greatest part of the
discussion, however, deals with the distributional and structural characteristics of
alienable vs. inalienable possession. A section on compound nouns (5.4) follows
naturally on that of possessive constructions, since most compound nouns are structured
in the same way. Formal and behavioural particularities of compound nouns are also
accounted for.
Plural formation, which comprises an additional topic (5.5), is achieved by means of a
loosely defined morphological template. In this section, the scope of pluralization is
delimited, and a range of possible structural alternations is recognized. Collective
constructions, which constitute an alternative plural-like strategy for some nouns, are also
considered (5.6).
In subsequent sections, four derivational topics are considered: participant noun
constructions (5.7), diminutives and augmentatives (5.8), verbal nouns (5.9) and the
promotion of modifiers to independent noun status (5.10). A mixture of derivational
strategies, including but not limited to affixation, is common to all four phenomena. For
verbal nouns in particular, complications in determining the direction of derivation are150acknowledged. Ordinal numerals, which constitute a closed category of nouns derived
from numerals, are dealt with in the presentation on numerals (9.1.3).
In later sections, ideophonic nouns (5.11) and proper names (5.12) are given special
attention, and the locative function of nouns is delineated in 5.13. In the final section, an
overview of noun phrase constructions is provided (5.14).","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

Indicative verb forms, which are used to express events (but see 7.4.1.2.1), are specified
for Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) values. While Realis forms signal events which
have happened or are happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already
happened and which are not happening.
7.4.1.1 Realis
Realis verb forms are divided into two aspects: Perfective (three tenses; 7.4.1.1.1) and
Imperfective (one tense; 7.4.1.1.2). Perfective forms signal events which, in reference to
a given point in time, have already happened. Imperfective forms are used for events
which, in reference to a given point in time, happen but are not completed.
One formal characteristic common to Realis verb forms is a subject pronoun paradigm
with a CV structure (6.1.2). Other formal features vary among the four constituent tenses.
A minor Realis Future verb form, which is found uniquely with the verb vè ‘go,’ is
discussed in 7.3.3.1.
7.4.1.1.1 Perfective
There are three perfective tenses: basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1), Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2), and
Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.3). Perfective verb forms have in common that they are based on
the verb stem, that third person forms are invariably marked with a zero pronoun, and
that negated forms are found with LH pronouns (7.5.3).
7.4.1.1.1.1 Basic Perfective
The basic Perfective tense is used for completed events. In contrast to the Perfect and
Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.2, 7.4.1.1.1.3), it is unspecified regarding the consequences of an
event for a later point in time. The basic Perfective tense is the default means of marking
sequential events in narrative discourse (Anonby 2005:29–32). It is typically structured
as follows:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfective tone)
ex. mì hèè
1SG climb:PFV
rò làà
)ígà
2PL eat:PFV thingI climbed

sections).","[358, 359]"

"5.4.2 Morphological constitution
Most compound nouns are composed of the linked form of one noun (5.3.3.3.1) followed
by the free (unmarked) form of another noun.
nàm kúù
wild animal
animal:LF bushland
sààrì tú ò
blood vessel
sinew:LF blood
As stated above, such compounds are formally equivalent to spontaneous possessive
constructions (5.3.3.1). Attested variations on the prototypical noun + noun compound
construction are as follows:
- three- and four-noun compounds (5.4.2.1);
- noun + numeral compounds (5.4.2.2);
- compounds containing prepositional phrases (5.4.2.3);
- clausal compounds (5.4.2.4);
197- compounds containing proper names (5.4.2.5); and
- nouns exhibiting reduplication (5.4.2.6).
Examples of compound nouns representing each of these structures are given in the
following paragraphs, and formally equivalent constructions are noted when they occur.
5.4.2.1 Three- and four-noun compounds
Some compounds are composed of three or even four nouns. In each case, these nouns
are internally organized such that one of the nouns in the construction is itself a
compound noun and/or a possessive construction. Examples of three-noun compounds
are as follows:
káà [và’zì dágà]
head:LF leaf:LF mouthlip (cf. và’zì dágà ‘lip area’)vbíílì [káà wáà]
drum:LF head:LF chiefdrum sp. (cf. káà wáà ‘chief (respect form)’)Four-noun compounds include the following:
nàm [[dâg tèNn] bà7gè]
gazelle sp. (cf. dâg tèNnú ‘bottom of the rib’)
animal:LF mouth:LF side(body):LF rust.colour
tí7gì [fàà [Nmàh zaFh]]
monitor lizard sp.
monitor.lizard:LF back:LF foot:LF ox
As these examples suggest, embedded compound nouns are more commonly found in the
possessor position rather than the possessed position of three- and four-noun compounds.
As is the case for spontaneous possessive constructions, which are formally equivalent,
the internal formal structure of the compound is ambiguous (cf. 5.3.2). For example, if
such a referential context were possible, nàm dâg tèNn bà7gè could also be understood
to mean ‘animal of mouth/edge of side of rust-colour.’
5.4.2.2 Noun + numeral compounds
Other compound nouns contain a numeral (9.1) as a dependent element.
hèègì dâg àt
knife:LF mouth:LF twocircumcision knife, scissorstòh dâg àt
snake:LF mouth:LF twosnake sp.vbîz bóm
fishhook:LF onefishing line198These compounds are formally equivalent to count constructions in which the head noun
is definite (5.14.3, 9.1.1.1). For example, depending on the referential context, vbîz bóm
may also be understood to mean ‘the one fishhook.’
5.4.2.3 Compounds containing prepositional phrases
A few compound nouns in the data contain or are comprised of prepositional phrases
(9.3):
páà bèè káálà
man:LF without headstupid personsáà dwaF’
inside bellywombThe prepositional phrases in these compounds are formally equivalent to normal
prepositional phrases (9.3.1). For example, depending on the referential context, sáà
dwaF’ may also be understood to mean ‘inside the belly.’
5.4.2.4 Clausal compounds
A number of compounds consist of combined clause elements. Minimally, there is a
subject and a predicate (most often represented by a pronoun and a conjugated verb
respectively). As shown by the example below, other components may include objects,
negation clitics, locative complements and clitics, and adverbial ideophones.

As is the case for prepositions (9.3), nouns may be used to indicate location (for formal
differences between the two word classes, see 9.3.3). Like objects of transitive verbs
(7.3.2.1.2), nouns functioning locatively are morphologically unmarked complements
which follow a verb.
Ø yàà fíílò
3:PFV stay:PFV house
cf. Ø kó fíílò
3:PFV see:PFV househe/she/it stayed at the house
he/she/it saw the house250Importantly, and similar to what is found in Mundang and some related languages (Elders
2000:253–4, Welmers 1973:216–7; cf. Ruelland 1992:230–1), there is no formal
difference between the two following a transitive verb. This may lead to ambiguity
which is only resolved in the referential realm, as the following example shows:
Ø làà4rì túrà
3:PFV eat:PERF-PERF millethe/she/it has eaten millet / he/she/it has eaten
at the millet (i.e., among the millet plants)When an object and locational complement are found in the same clause, the object
comes first.
Ø làà túrà )áà
3:PFV eat:PFV millet beanshe/she/it has eaten millet among the bean plantsØ làà )áà túrà
3:PFV eat:PFV beans millethe/she/it has eaten beans among the millet plantsAlthough a wide range of nouns could be used in a locative function, three categories in
particular are commonly used: locations in the referential realm, inherently locative
nouns, and body parts used in a locative capacity.
Examples of locations in the referential realm (see also 5.12.3) are as follows:

3:PFV stay:PFV here thishe/she/it stayed right hereThat these words are nouns rather than prepositions is proven by their compatibility with
dependent noun phrase elements such as possessor nouns, possessive pronouns and
specifiers. This is shown in the example sentences above.

5.3.4.2.2).

Noun phrases are constructions involving a head noun and, potentially, additional
elements. Like clauses (10.1.1) and prepositional phrases (9.3), noun phrases are leftheaded in Mambay. The following noun phrase constructions are used commonly:
noun + noun (including possessive pronouns and noun phrases)
noun + adjective
noun + numeral
noun + specifier
noun + prepositional phrase
noun + relative clause
In the subsections below, examples of these constructions are provided.","[265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270]"
"7.6.1 TAM indicators
In addition to TAM (Tense/Aspect/Mode) marking in the basic verbal system (7.4), TAM
is marked by means of TAM particles (7.6.1.1) and adverbs (7.6.1.2). Particles form a
closed set and, since they bear a single mora, do not meet the minimal weight
requirements for adverbs (8.1, 8.3). TAM adverbs, on the other hand, are part of the open
class of adverbs (8.1).",[377]
"Finally, a number of high frequency verbs express locational information.

CLAUSES AND CLAUSE COMBINATIONS
10CLAUSES AND CLAUSE COMBINATIONSThe present chapter deals with clauses (10.1) and clause combinations (10.2) in Mambay.
While these topics are treated in greater detail within the context of an analysis of
Mambay discourse (Anonby 2005), an overview of major patterns is given here.","[447, 448]"
"2886.1.5.1 Emphatic subject pronouns
For most of the personal pronouns, any type of emphatic subject pronoun may be
produced by placing an independent pronoun (6.1.2.1) before a subject pronoun of the
same person.

(6.1.5.1.2) and third person plural (6.1.5.1.3), the emphatic pronoun template is more
complex than this. In all of these cases, the attested strategies include lengthening of
independent pronouns and the presence of a word-final L tone (compare emphatic
negative objects in 10.1.2.3). This is possible for these three pronouns only because they
are segmentally distinct from verbal subject pronouns, where length and tone are already
used to mark TAM distinctions (6.1.2.4–6.1.2.6).
6.1.5.1.1 Third person singular
For emphatic forms of third person singular subject pronouns, the pronoun dúù is used.
It resembles the default third person singular independent pronoun dú (6.1.2.1), but its
vowel is long and it carries a HL rather than a H tone melody.
For most verb forms, dúù patterns like other emphatic subject pronouns (6.1.5.1): it is
placed before a regular subject pronoun.

subject pronouns, an additional level of emphasis may be achieved by placing an
independent pronoun dú (6.1.2.1) before the emphatic pronoun (dúù).

Emphatic forms of first-and-second person plural subject pronouns are produced in two
ways. First, in the case of verbal subject pronouns, an independent pronoun nànzà
(6.1.2.1) is placed before the verbal subject pronoun.

"Within a sentence, conjunctions may also be used to coordinate clauses. mûn is used to
coordinate sequential clauses.

"In the data, such compounds describe the appearance or behaviour of a species or natural
phenomenon. In most cases, literate Mambay speakers insist that these terms should be
written as single words.
In Mambay, there are no compounds comprised of only a verb phrase (e.g. “run-a-gate”
or “cache-sexe”); such compounds are expressed by clauses (as shown in this section) or
participant noun constructions (5.7).
5.4.2.5 Compounds containing proper names
A further group of compounds, namely those which contain proper names, are of interest
for several reasons. First of all, these nouns contain only canonical names (5.12.1.1).
Secondly, the internal structure of these nouns is complex; in some cases, like those
shown in the previous section (5.4.2.4), these nouns are composed of clause elements.
Thirdly, and as is also the case with most nouns composed of clause elements (5.4.2.4),
speakers of the language insist that nouns containing proper names should be
orthographically fused.

Nouns exhibiting reduplication differ from other compounds in that they are composed of
two morphologically similar or identical roots whose semantic value is opaque (see
5.11.2 for further discussion).
