This interrogative particle is not present in my corpus and, since the dialect that Hale
recorded appears to be closer to Gudanji than Wambaya,19 it is possible that the interrogative
particle gayi is present only in Gudanji. However, there is a negative interrogative particle in '
Wambaya present in both my corpus and Hale's notes, and also reported by Chadwick
(1978:99). The form of this particle is wayi and, like the negative particle guyala, it requires
the presence of irrealis marking in the auxiliary. There is some variability as to how sentences
containing this particle are translated into English: either as negative yes/no questions
(examples (7-143), (7-144)); information questions meaning `why not' (7-143); or as simple
positive yes/no questions ((7-145), (7-146)):

"NEG1 SG.A-NACT.PRThis semantic difference between the two particles helps to explain their different
behaviour with respect to the irrealis markers in the auxiliary. If guyala is a negative modal
expressing `unlikelihood' then it is not surprising that it should require an irrealis marker in
the auxiliary, since these markers are often used to express modal meanings of `should' and
`would' in positive (usually counterfactual) sentences (see §5.2.4).24
Verbless clauses are also negated with either guyala or yangula, although of the few
examples in the corpus most contain guyala. As shown in the following examples, the
negative particle may be either initial in the clause (example (7-173)) or initial in the predicate
(7-174).

"7.6.1.2 NEGATION OF IMPERATIVE CLAUSES
Imperative clauses are negated with the use of the negative imperative particle alyu
(glossed `NEG.IMP') which must always be initial in the clause.25 In negative imperative
clauses the auxiliary (when present) appears in the non-future tense form and the verb can24 It is interesting that, given this semantic difference, it is guyala rather than yangula that is used as aninterjection with the meaning 'no, nothing'. This may be due to politeness: in the face of a request. it is
more polite to suggest that the reason for saying 'no' is beyond one's control than to simply refuse (e.g.
I can 't versus I won't).
25 The Gudanji negative imperative particle is durdami. Note that, unlike in Wambaya (see §5.5).
imperative clauses in Gudanji always have an auxiliary even when singular. Thus in a typical singular
negative imperative clause, durdami is followed by the auxiliary nya.",[220]

NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PRI suspect that the basic use of wayî is in yes/no questions when the speaker is anticipating
a negative reply, and that examples such as (7-145) and (7-146) could probably have been
explained in this way in the contexts in which they were given. The information question
associated with (7-143) could arise for pragmatic reasons: if the speaker asks the question
Aren't you listening? then it might be expected that he/she is also looking for an explanation
why. However, further research is required in order to test this hypothesis and more
accurately determine the meaning of this particle and the contexts of its use.
7.5.2 INFORMATION QUESTIONS
These questions involve the use of an indefinite/interrogative, usually initial in the clause,
that indicates the nature of the information being sought. As in many Australian languages,
indefinite/interrogatives in Wambaya can be used either in interrogative function (e.g. `who',
`what') or as indefinite pronouns (e.g. `someone', `something'). They contain one of five
basic roots: gayinî- `what, who'; inja- `where, which'; yangula `when'; yangulanji `how
19 Based on the forms of the auxiliaries and the negative particles he recorded, as well as some of the lexical
items.",[216]
"200Chapter 7The constructions are primarily distinguished by the form of the negative particle —
yangula or guyala — which appears in initial position in the clause.20 Guyala is also used
alone to mean `no, nothing'; yangula is never used in this function. There is one other respect
in which the two constructions differ: while both particles (usually) require the presence of
the hypothetical suffix in the auxiliary in future clauses, only guyala has the further
requirement that the auxiliary contain an irrealis mood suffix in past and present tense
clauses. In past and present tense clauses with yangula the auxiliary has the same form that it
would in the corresponding positive sentence. Examples include the following. Note that in
future tense negative clauses the verb does not inflect for future tense (see §6.1.2):
(7-155) Guyala ng-uda
NEGgajbî manganyma.","[217, 218]"
"The hypothetical suffix is the future tense counterpart of the non-actual suffixes in negative
clauses, co-occuring with the negative particles guyala and yangula in negative future tense
constructions:1613 This is the analysis implicit in Hale's description (1959:ií) and suggested by Jane Simpson (pers.
comm.).
14 As pointed out by Jane Simpson (pers. comm.), the fact that -u is used in polite imperatives may be
further support for its general irrealis function: irrealis is often used for politeness, as demonstrated by
the Aboriginal English ""You might do X for me"" or ""Might be we do X"".
15 In Chadwick (1978) and Nordlinger (1993a), this suffix is considered to he a future tense irrealis suffix.
However, it is not clear how an future tense irrealis suffix would differ from the simple future tense
suffix — all future tense constructions being, by definition, irrealis — and thus the analysis given here is
preferred.
16 Note that this is slightly different from the non-actual suffixes, which are found in negative constructions
containing the negative particle guyala only; they do not co-occur with the negative particle yanRula. For
a more detailed discussion of negation see §7.6.",[168]
"3SG.M.A-HYP good-FAC againHe won't be able to fix it again.
While the large majority of negative future tense constructions contain the hypothetical
suffix, there are a few examples in which the negative particle yangula appears with the
simple future tense suffix -u (example (5-66)). See §7.6 for a more detailed discussion of
negation.

7.6.2 CONSTITUENT NEGATION
7.6.2.1 THE USE OF THE PRIVATIVE SUFFIX
The privative suffix can be added to a verb X to derive a nominal with the meaning `one
who doesn't or is unable to x'. Thus, this suffix is used to negate a quality or action.
Examples of the use of this suffix with verbs are given in §4.4.12. Some others are given
here for further exemplification.

7.6.2.2 NP NEGATION
There are a few different techniques for negating the presence or existence of an entity.
Most commonly, the derived nominal guyaliny- is used, taking the negated entity as its dative
argument. The use of this nominal is discussed in detail in §4.4,13.1. An example is:204Chapter 7(7-180) Guyalinyangawurniji manganymi-nka.lacking.II(NOM) 1 SG.NOMtucker.III-DATI've got no tucker.
In other examples, the negative particle guyala is used in its basic form and the negated NP
appears in the dative case. In this constuction guyala appears to function as an existential
negator:
ngi(7-181) Guyala gaguluna-nka, gagulinya
NEGyabu.y.brother.I-DAT y.sister.II(ACC) 1SG.A(PR) haveNo brothers, (but) I have a younger sister.
In a small number of examples guyala is used, but the negated NP is not in the dative case.
In this construction guyala appears to function as an argument negator. This construction
differs from that in which guyala is used to mark sentential negation as the negative particle is
not in initial position and there is no irrealis marking in the auxiliary. Furthermore, it seems
that guyala in these examples does not have the modal meaning that is associated with its use
as a sentential negator (see §7.6.1).

7.7 CLITICS AND PARTICLES
7.7.1 CLITICS
7.7.1.1 =MIJT `INFERential'
The clitic =mijî is used to mark epistemic mood and is encliticised to the first word of the
clause. Like the epistemic uses of the modals `must' and `might' in English, the use of =miji
indicates that the speaker has drawn an inference or conclusion as to the truth of the
proposition on the basis of available information.26 The most common usage of =miji in
Wambaya is as in examples (7-184) to (7-186), in which it denotes probability; the
information available to the speaker suggests that the proposition is likely to be true. In these
examples =mijî is translated by speakers into English as `must be'.

"7.7.2 PARTICLESThere are seven particles in the corpus: the negative particles guyala, yangula and alyu; the
negative interrogative wayi; the exclamative marker gubi and the conjunctions ngaha `THEN'
and gaji `LEST'.30 In addition there are three particles present in Hale's (1959) notes, but not
found in my corpus. These are the interrogative particle gayi and the conjunctions ngabayi
`admonitive' and marda `when'. The two interrogative particles and the three negative
particles were discussed above in §7.5 and §7.6 respectively. The other five particles are
discussed below_
7.7.2.1 GUB! 'EXCLAM'
There are only a few examples of this particle in the corpus and so it is difficult to
determine its exact meaning. However, in the small number of examples in which it is found.
29 See McConvell (1983) and McGregor (1990:459ff) for detailed discussions of the semantics of enclitics
30meaning 'only' and 'just' in other Australian languages.
The latter is found in the speech of only one consultant and so may not actually belong to Wambaya: see
§7.7.2.3 below.",[225]
"1SG.S-FUT goI'm not going.
However, despite seemingly equivalent examples such as these, there does appear to be a
semantic difference between the two particles. While yangula seems to be more of a general,
unmarked negation marker, the use of guyala implies that there are external factors, beyond
the actor's control, that prevent (or at least, make unlikely) the execution of the act described
by the proposition.221 Thus, guyala appears to be a negative modal22 indicating
`impossibility' or `unlikelihood', similar to English `can't'. Yangula, on the other hand,
denotes simple propositional negation and is therefore unmarked; it can be used either in
situations in which guyala would be inappropriate (i.e. there are no external forces which
prevent the action from being carried out) or in situations where the existence or absence of
such forces is simply not relevant.23 Some examples illustrating this semantic difference
follow.

"Syntax of simple sentences199much'; and wunjugu `how'. Of these, the first two are inflected with regular gender and case
marking in order to cover such meanings as `who, what, with what, for what' and `which,

follow; indefinitermterrogatives are discussed in more detail in §4.7.

7.6 NEGATION
7.6.1 SENTENTL&L NEGATION
7.6.1.1 NEGATION OF INDICATIVE CLAUSES
There are two alternative constructions available for negating an indicative clause, each
containing a different negative particle (glossed NEG). Although speakers claim that the two
constructions have the same meaning, the distribution of each construction in the corpus
suggests that there is in fact a difference in usage between the two I will discuss this
difference below, but first I will explain and exemplify the structural characteristics of the
constructions.","[216, 217]"
"NEG1 SG.A-NACT.PR. send20 The Gudanji negative particle is gabi. It behaves like guyala in requiring irrealis marking in the auxiliary
and in being used as an interjection meaning `no, nothing'.",[218]
"Parts of speech and other preliminaries533.1.2.2 PARTICLES
There are only a few particles in Wambaya. Particles have grammatical functions, such as
marking yes/no interrogative clauses, marking negation in declarative and imperative clauses,
and linking two finite clauses into a single complex clause. They are formally distinguished
from adverbs as they have strict positional restrictions: particles almost always occur in initial
position. Particles are discussed in §7.7.2.
3.1.2.3 arms
Clitics can be distinguished from other non-inflecting word classes as they are bound
forms; they can not stand alone as words.10 There are three clitics in the corpus: =miji, =nima
and =minyi. Miji (glossed INFER') expresses epistemic mood; it indicates that the speaker
considers the proposition to be probable or possible, but does not know for sure whether or
not it is actual. It is an unrestricted clitic and is always encliticised to the initial word of the
clause. Nîma (glossed `NST') can usually be translated by English words such as `just',
`only' and `still', although in some examples it seems to have an emphatic function. It is a
restricted clitic which usually occurs with nominals, although it can also occur with verbs and
other word classes. The other clitic, =minyi (glossed `AGAIN'), is used only with verbs. It is
encliticised to the verb over which it has scope. These three clitics are discussed and
exemplified in §7.7.1.
3.1.2.4 INTERJECTIONS
There are only a small number of interjections in Wambaya. Interjections can constitute a
complete utterance on their own and are therefore distinguished from word classes such as
adverbs and particles. Examples of interjections in Wambaya include gunku `I/we don't
know', guyala `no, nothing' and alima `OK, goodbye'.
Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
`Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
§7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.","[70, 71]"
"There is another type of 'lacking' clause in which the predicate is the derived nominal
guyaliny- 'lacking'. This nominal is derived from the negative particle guyala and is inflected
for gender, agreeing with the subject of the clause.4 Guyaliny- can appear alone in the
predicate (example (7-15)), or be accompanied by a dative complement which expresses what
it is that is lacking ((7-16) and (7-17)). When there is no dative complement (as in (7-15)),
the object that is lacking is considered to be clear from context.",[193]
"As mentioned above, speakers say that there is no difference in meaning between guyala
and yangula constructions and there are cases in which two sentences, one of each type of
negative construction, are said to have the same meaning. Thus:
(7-164) Guyala ng-udî
NEGyarru.",[219]
"The future tense inflection is used both in imperative constructions (as discussed above)
and in future tense constructions (examples (6-5) and (6-6)). In clauses with immediate future
tense however, and in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form.
For examples of clauses with immediate future tense see (6-1) and (6-2). Some examples of
future tense negative clauses follow.
(6-19)Yangula irr-agba
jiyawu.
NEG
3PLA-HYP give(NF)
They will not give it to him.",[181]
"The absence of future tense marking in these constructions can probably be accounted for
by the fact that the negative particle and the directional suffixes are specifically imperative.
Thus, with their presence the clause is already marked as imperative, rendering it unnecessary
for this to be also indicated on the verb.
Verbs such as yarru `go' and yabu `take, have', which do not distinguish future and nonfuture tense (see Table 6.4 above), always co-occur with directional suffixes in the imperative
mood. As these directional suffixes are inherently imperative, it is thus possible to make a
distinction between imperative clauses and future tense clauses with these verbs.66Note that, as these verbs make no distinction between future and non-future tenses, the glossing of them
as `FUT' in these examples is, to a certain extent, arbitrary.",[180]
"1 SG.A-PST throwI didn't throw it.
21 . These reasons could be: a physical or mental inability to; the fact that doing so may he contravening
social rules or norms; the fact that someone else won't allow you to, ctc.
22 I am indebted to Jane Simpson for this observation.
23 Interestingly, as drawn to my attention by Tracy King, Georgian also has a similar lexicalised distinction
between two negative particles (Aronson 1989:145).",[219]
"1.2 ITS SPEAKERS
1.2.1 HISTORY
The West Barkly communities have suffered greatly since European settlement, losing
virtually all their traditional land to white pastoralists well over a century ago. Survival by
III2This looks suspiciously like Gurindji, but he claims that the country belonging to these people lies to
the east of Powell Creek in the Northern Territory.
Actually, although called Wambaya, the forms of the auxiliary, the negative particles and many of the
lexical items contained in these field notes suggest that the dialect Hale recorded is one closer to Gudanji
than Wambaya.",[24]
"When attached directly to one of the plural subject bound pronouns ngirri ` I PL.EXC', girri
`2PL' or irri '3PL', the non-actual suffixes have the forms -iji and -ija respectively:ngirriji t PL.EXC.S/A-NACT.PR
girrija 2PL.S/A-NACT.PST
irriji
3PL.S/A-NACT.PR
These non-actual suffixes (-udi/ uji, uda/-uja) appear to be made up of the suffix -a (the
future tense suffix, see §5.2.1) and a tense component: -di/-ji 'present tense', -da/-ja `past150Chapter 5tense'.13 This suggests that -u may be a more general irrealis marker, interpreted as a future
tense marker when no further inflection is present. For simplicity, however, and since future
tense is now its primary function in Wambaya, I will continue to gloss the suffix -u as 'FUT',
and will treat the non-actual suffixes as portmanteau morphemes, as in the examples above.l 4
The non-actual suffixes are most commonly used with the negative particle guyala
(examples (5-53), (5-55), (5-57), (5-58)). They can also be used without guyala however, to
indicate that something that was not done should have been done (5-54), (5-59) or that
something would have been done in a hypothetical situation (5-56). They can also be used to
express the meaning of `want' (with the implication that what is wanted is not possible):
(5-60)Gambanga-ni ng-udi
mirra.
sun.II-LOC
ISG.S-NACT.PR sit
I want to sit in the sun (but can't).","[167, 168]"
"The distribution of the future verbal suffix, which is found in imperative clauses and
positive future tense clauses, suggests that `future tense' may not be the best characterisation
of the function of this suffix. It is also not possible to treat it as a general irrealis mood suffix,
since it is not found in negative future tense clauses, nor in examples in which an irrealis
mood suffix appears on the auxiliary (see §5.2.4). The function of this suffix is complex and
still not fully understood and thus, in lieu of further research, I will refer to it as the `future
tense' suffix, while acknowledging the term's inadequacies. See Nordlinger (1996) for
further discussion.
6.1.3 INFINITIVE SUFFIX
The form of the infinitive suffix is -barda, or -warda following liquids and /u/. With two
verbs it has the irregular form -arda: nanganangali `sneak away' > nanganangal-arda `sneak
away-INF'; gajurru `dance' > gajurr-arda `dance-INF'. The infinitive suffix occurs with verbs
in non-finite subordinate clauses and is discussed in more detail in §8.1. Some examples of
its use are:
(6-21)Ngaj-bi ngî-ny-ayarru-warda.see-NF 1 SG.A-20-PST go-INF
I saw you walking along.",[182]
"In two types of imperative constructions — negative imperative constructions and
constructions containing imperative directional suffixes — it is possible for the verb to appear
without future tense marking. Examples include (6-3) and (6-4) above, and the following:
(6-9)A lyu
junmi/junmi-j-ba!

207PREFACE
Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and longterm interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.xiACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"8.2.2 COORDINATE CLAUSES
Although structurally similar, these clauses differ from those discussed above as the
relationship between the two clauses is one of coordination, rather than subordination. Thus,
these complex clauses typically correspond to those conjoined with `and', `but' and `then' in
English. In Wambaya, however, these clauses are generally juxtaposed, without any
conjunction linking them together; the one exception being clauses conjoined with ngaba,
which are discussed in §8.2.2.1 below.19

needed.
19 One speaker (MH) makes use of a number of other conjunctions, such as ngala `but' and gaji 'lest'.
However, since this speaker is said to speak a dialect closer to Gudanji than Wambaya, and since these
conjunctions are not used by other speakers, I do not include them in the discussion here. For examples
of gaji see §7.7.2.3. An example of her use of ngala is:

It seems that when a negative indicative clause has immediate future tense, the auxiliary
does not contain the hypothetical suffix. In this case yangula clauses usually have simple

In the following example, the secondary predicate (bugayirna ngabulungunya) is in the
nominative case, even though the clause is transitive and the subject is registered with a
transitive subject bound pronoun (and must, therefore, have ergative/locative case). This is
presumably because ergative NPs do not take ergative/locative case marking when fronted
(see §4.4.3).

True secondary predicates, such as those above, are characterised by the fact that the
clause can be seen as the conjunction of two separate predications: one without the secondary
predicate, and the other a nominal clause with the secondary predicate as the nominal
predicate. For example, (7-126) consists of the two propositions Gulugbi ga `She slept' and
Ilijbirna (nagarna) `(She) was alone'. Such constructions can thus be distinguished from the
syntactically similar use of (usually body-part) NPS in constructions of inalienable
possession. Consider the following examples:

The modifying NP in these examples, like those functioning as secondary predicates, must
agree with the head noun in case. However, unlike example (7-126), (7-134) is not anSyntax of simple sentences197example of a true secondary predicate construction since an attempt to decompose it into two
propositions would give Bagijbi ngin 'I feel sick' and the non-sensical (Ngawurniji) juruma
`I am a stomach'. A further difference between the two constructions in Wambaya is that,
while the modifying NP in secondary predicate constructions must agree with the head noun
in gender and number as well as case, this is not true for examples such as (7-134) and (7135) above. For example, the subject in (7-134) (taken from Text 4 in Appendix A) has
masculine gender, while the nominal juruma `stomach' has vegetable gender. Therefore,
following Evans (1995a), I distinguish between true secondary predicate constructions and
subject/object-construed body-part constructions such as those in (7-134) and (7-135)
respectively.
A small number of verbs subcategorise for secondary predicates on the subject, in which
case the modifying NP is referred to as a subject complement. Verbs requiring subject
complements were discussed in §7.2. For convenience, one example of the reflexive verb
manku `to feel', which subcategorises for a subject complement expressing the emotion
attributed to the subject, is repeated here.

7.5 QUESTIONS
7.5.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
Yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence,

Hale's corpus contains examples in which an interrogative particle gayi is used in such
polar yes/no questions. Note that this particle appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140)
and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142):18

LSG.POSS.ICNOM)' and `2DU.ACC respectively, I do not understand the use of gulinya. which means
'daughter'. I have therefore just translated it in the way that it was translated by MG: ""my two sons, my
two sons"".
The translation here does not accurately reflect the structure of the Wambaya sentence but I do not know
how else it could be translated. As far as I can determine the meaning is that the people arc causing the
smoke to rise. I do not know why the word used is 'fire' and not 'smoke'.
I do not understand why the habitual past tense is used here - unless it can also function as a distant past.
This is something to be checked.
This phrase is important to the story but I am not really sure of its meaning. MG translates it as
""l0000ng way"" and said that bulyawu is a name that the Eaglehawk has just created for a fictitious piece
of country where she is claiming the men are.",[245]

Although these two reduplication patterns account for most of the reduplicated forms in
Wambaya, there are a few other forms which are reduplicated in slightly different ways. In a
couple of examples the reduplicated form is derived by copying the last two syllables of the
word to the right:
ya.rru.bu.rdu
garr.ga.lyiwalk around > ya.rru.bu.rdu-bu.rdu
plains lizard > garr.ga.lyî-ga.lyîkeep walking around
plains lizardSome other reduplicated forms (of nouns) appear to be unpredictable:
alaji

iligirra river > ililirriboys
riversCHAPTER 3PARTS OF SPEECH AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES3.1 PARTS OF SPEECH
There are seven parts of speech (or `word classes') in Wambaya, determined by the
inflectional and distributional characteristics of each word. These classes are mutually
exclusive:1 each root belongs to only one word class, although with the use of derivational
suffixes, it is possible for a root to move its membership from one word class to another.
These derivational suffixes are discussed in §4.5.2 (verb to nominal) and §6.2.2 (nominal to
verb). The seven parts of speech in Wambaya are:
(1)NOMINALS(i) nouns
(ii) adjectives
(iii) free pronouns
(iv) demonstratives
(v) locational nominals
(vi) temporal nominals
(vii) indefinite/interrogatives

(7)VERBS
AUXILIARY
ADVERBS
PARTICLES
CLITICS
INTERJECTIONSOf these seven word classes, the two largest and most important are the open classes of
verbs and nominals. These two classes have quite distinct morphological and syntactic
characteristics. Nominals generally inflect for gender, number and case and usually function
as the arguments of the clause.2 Verbs on the other hand are inflected for tense, co-occur with
the auxiliary and typically function as the predicate of the clause. Both classes also have
different derivational possibilities. Although word-class membership is determined primarily
on grammatical and functional grounds such as these, it is also possible to characterise the
difference between these two word classes on semantic grounds: verbs typically describe
states, actions and events, and nominals usually denote entities, objects and attributes.3
In the following discussion I divide the word classes into `inflecting' (nominals, verbs and
the auxiliary) and `non-inflecting' (adverbs, particles, clitics and interjections).","[63, 64]"
"3PL.S-PST water-PRIV.IV-LOCThey lived in the desert.
As with the proprietive suffix, speakers disagree as to whether or not it is grammatically
correct for the privative suffix to occur on all words in a NP. Thus, while some speakers (e.g.
MH) consider example (4-192) to be a fully grammatical sentence, for at least one other
speaker (MG) it is impossible, a verbal clause such as (4-193) being necessary instead.",[117]
"3.1.1.3 AUXILIARY
The auxiliary is a fundamental constituent of Wambaya grammar. Its presence is
obligatory in every main verbal clause9 and most finite subordinate clauses. The auxiliary
contains most of the important grammatical information for the clause. It contains bound
pronouns which represent the core arguments of the clause and affixes which indicate tense,
aspect and mood. Although limited tense information is marked on the verb, that contained in
the auxiliary is usually more detailed and informative. Furthermore, there is some information
(such as habitual aspect and hypothetical mood) which is only ever marked on the auxiliary,
never on the verb. The auxiliary can also contain directional suffixes which indicate whether
the action described by the verb occurs in a direction away from or towards the speaker. The
auxiliary almost always occurs in second position in the clause. A detailed discussion of the
auxiliary and its component parts is found in Chapter 5.
Phonologically, the auxiliary has some unusual characteristics. It is the only grammatical
word in Wambaya which can be monosyllabic, and the only word which can have a final
consonant. For the purposes of stress, a polysyllabic auxiliary constitutes a separate stress
domain, while a monosyllabic auxiliary cliticises to the preceding word and does not bear
stress (see §2.2.4).",[70]

pers.comm.). It is also similar to the use of the ignorative clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa

same way: Where is X? Might be somewhere.28

translating English words such as 'just', 'only' and 'still'. It is most commonly used with
nouns and adjectives, but can also be used with other parts of speech such as verbs (example
27 However, the clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa has a different meaning than =miji in wamhaya. as its use with
other word classes is inferred to be a request for the hearer to affirm or deny the correctness of the
statement (Donaldson 1980:260). The use of =miji has no such implicature.

"CHAPTER 7SYNTAX OF SIMPLE SENTENCESWambaya has two basic clause types (divided according to their predicators): verbal and
nominal (or verbless). A verbal clause has a finite verb as predicate and, except for under
certain discourse conditions (see §5.4), always requires the presence of the auxiliary.
Nominal clauses, on the other hand, have either nominal predicates or predicates consisting
of a purposive non-finite subordinate clause and cannot contain an auxiliary. A simple
sentence consists of a single clause of either type. I will begin with a discussion of verbless
clauses — those with nominal predicates — and will then discuss verbal clauses in §7.2. Nonfinite subordinate clauses are discussed in §8.1.
7.1 VERBLESS CLAUSES
For the purposes of this study I will assume verbless clauses to consist of a subject and a
(usually nominal) predicate.' Note that `subject' in this context, in which it is opposed to
`predicate', is used differently than in verbal clauses, in which it is opposed to `object'.
Verbless clauses do not contain an auxiliary, and therefore do not indicate tense. The tense
of these clauses is usually taken to be the same tense as the rest of the discourse or, if uttered
in isolation, present tense. If it is necessary for a verbless clause to be marked for past or
future tense, it can be made into a verbal clause with the use of mina `sit, be' and thereby
contain an auxiliary. The use of mina as a type of `copula' verb is discussed in §7.1.7.
As with other types of sentences, word order in verbless clauses is relatively free; the
subject can precede (example (7-1)) or follow (7-5) the predicate, or can be discontinuous (74). The subjects of these clauses are often modified (or represented) by a demonstrative that
can mark definiteness and therefore emphasise the subject. In all verbless clauses, the subject
must be in the nominative case. In ascriptive and having/lacking verbless clauses, the
predicate must also be in the nominative case and agree with the subject in both gender and
number.
7.1.1 ASCRIPTTVE CLAUSES
The predicate of an ascriptive clause attributes a certain property to the subject. The
predicate can be an adjective (examples (7-1) and (7-2)); a full noun phrase (7-3); a nominal
inflected with an adnominal suffix, such as the `origin' suffix (7-4); or a nominal derived
with the agentive or pri vative suffixes ((7-5) and (7-6)). Both subject and predicate must
agree in case (nominative), gender and number.","[190, 191]"
"7.7.2.4 NGABAY/ `LEST'
This particle is present in Hale's (1959) notes, but is not present in my corpus. Hale
describes it as an admonitive complementiser and it appears to be used in much the same way
as gaji, discussed in §7.7.2.3 above. Its resemblance to the particle ngaba, which is also
contained in Hale's data, is noteworthy, but more research is needed to determine what the
relationship may be between the two forms. An example from Hale's notes is:

frightened 1SG.S(PR) 2SG.OBL LEST
2SG.A-10-NF hit

Hale notes that ngabayî can also be used in conditional constructions with the irrealis
marker in the auxiliary, as in the following example:

7.7.2.5 MARDA `WHEN'
Marda is another particle which is present in Hale's (1959) corpus, but not in mine
(although Hale does not list marda in the sketch grammar at the beginning of his notes).
There are only a couple of examples in his corpus in which marda appears; in both of these it
introduces a clause temporally prior to the main clause and can be translated as `when':Syntax of simple sentences211(7-220) Marda ngi-ma35 gubaji

only by a rising intonation (see Chapter 8 for further discussion).

5.3 DIRECTIONAL SUFFIXES
The Wambaya auxiliary can also contain directional suffixes (Table 5.4), which are used
to indicate whether the action takes place towards or away from a deictic centre, usually the
speaker. These suffixes also mark tense — past and non-past — and occur in place of the tense
suffixes discussed in §5.2.1 above. There are no examples in which the directional suffixes
co-occur with any of the aspect or mood markers.

AWAYNON-PAST-amany -ulama
-(g)any
-(g)ubaThese forms appear to contain the tense markers -a- `past tense', and -u- 'non-past tense'.
Note that these are common tense suffixes (see §5.2.1), although -u usually marks future
tense only. If the initial vowel marks tense, the remainder of the form must mark the152Chapter 5direction. However, since there is not a lot of similarity between the pairs of forms in this
respect I treat each form as if it were a portmanteau of tense and direction.""
In two examples in the corpus, the `direction away' forms have an initial velar stop when
they follow the first person object bound pronoun, -ng:
(5-70)Dulanymî nyi-ng-gany
gulugî-nnga.

However, in most examples with the same object bound pronoun the velar stop is not
present.
The two non-past forms have initial Iii/ when they follow one of the three subject bound
pronouns: ngirrî- IPL.EXC', girrî- `2PL' and irri- '3PL'. For example:

In one example =nîma appears within the word giliyaga 'there'. This word is made up of

see §4.6).
(7-199) Mirra g-a

3SG.S-PST here=JUST-remote
I stayed right there.
The different uses of =nima are related by the fact that they all se rve to modify
presupposed expectations; the clitic functions as an expectation modifier (McConvell 1983),
highlighting deviation from a presupposition that something more or different would be
expected. In example (7-192), for instance, =nima denies the presupposition that the speaker
would have been given both meat and bread; in (7-195), it denies an expectation that the
travellers would have arrived at their destination already; and in (7-199) the function of =nima
is to deny the presupposition that the speaker went anywhere else. The 'counter-expectation'
meaning of (7-198) is not so obvious. However, this utterance was given in a context in
which the speaker was complaining about the fact that people always come and ask her forSyntax of simple sentences207tobacco. Thus, =pima seems to be used to assert that the tobacco she carries is for her use
only, and not for anyone else' s 29
7.7.1.3 =MINY/ `AGAIN'
The clitic -minyi `AGAIN' is used only with verbs. It is attached to the verb over which it
has scope. There are only a few examples of this clitic in the corpus, including:
galyurrungurna.
(7-200) Bardgu-j-ba=minyi g-u
fall-TH-FUT=AGAIN 3SG.S-FUT rain.II(NOM)
It'll rain again.

(7-202) Gulugi-nka=minyi gi-n
yugu.
sleep-DAT=AGAIN 3SG.S(PR)-PROG cry
He's crying to go back to sleep (i.e. because he's tired).
As can be seen in the examples above, =minyî can be used with either of the two senses
that McConvell (1983) identi fies for English `again': (i) repetition of an action or situation
and (ii) return to a former position or state. In example (7-200) =minyi indicates repetition of
the full situation: it is true that the event of raining will be repeated. In (7-201) and (7-202) on
the other hand, =minyi indicates only a return to a former state or position, rather than a
repetition of the whole event. Thus (7-202), for example, means that `he' was asleep before
and that he is crying in order to return to that former state of sleeping. It does not mean that
the event of his crying has happened before and is now being repeated. Similarly, (7-201)
describes the situation in which `she' was here and will return to this former position. It does
not refer to a repetition of the event of returning.","[223, 224, 225]"
"Imperative constructions are discussed in more detail in §6.1.2.
Its appearance in some future and imperative constructions as well as the fact that it is
always the citation form of the verb suggests that the non-future form is really more like an
unmarked verb form. Therefore, I will treat it as unmarked in example sentences elsewhere in
this work:
dagunta
ngajbihit(not 'hit(NF)')see (not ngaj-bi `see-NF')6.1.2 FUTURE INFLECTION
The future tense suffix is -ba, or -wa after liquids. As well as being used in future tense
clauses (examples (6-5) and (6-6)), the future tense suffix also marks imperative mood ((6-7)
and (6-8)). While they contain the same verbal inflection, an imperative construction is
distinguished from a future tense construction since the auxiliary in an imperative
See Table 6.5 for the possible combinations of verbal and auxiliary tense categories.",[179]

talk-AGNT.II(NOM) that.II.SG.NOM
That woman's a chatterbox.
In this function, the difference between the two types is very similar to the difference
between `this' and `that' in English. The proximate forms are usually used to refer to things
that are close to the speaker, while the remote forms are used for things that are further away
from the speaker. The proximate forms can also be used with a presentative function; similar
to the use of `here' in an English sentence such as `here's something interesting going on'.
Thus in the following example, taken from Text A.1, the fire is referred to with the
demonstrative yana despite the fact that it is a considerable distance from the speaker.
(4-237) ""Ngangaba
yana
gi-n
trajbi.""
fire.IV(NOM) this.IV.SG.NOM 3SG.S(PR)-PROG bum
""There's a fire burning (there).""
Demonstratives also perform an important discourse function: they are used in the
organisation of information and tracking of reference. Demonstratives can be used to refer to
things previously mentioned or alluded to in discourse. The difference between the proximate
and remote demonstratives is metaphorically extended into this function. Proximate forms are
used when the antecedent or discourse topic is close (in terms of time of utterance) to the
utterance of the demonstrative (generally in either the same or preceding clause, but no more
than two clauses back):53

"I:go:FUTI shall go.

Blake (p.54) claims that (a) contains a verb prefixed with a bound pronoun which in (b) functions as a
grammatical verb governing a non-finite lexical verb. According to my corpus the form in (a) is not a
verb but the auxiliary, and can be a complete utterance only in a context where it is clearly understood
which verb has been ellipsed. Thus, the more correk;t version of (a) would be yarru nguba in which the
auxiliary occurs with the verb yarru meaning 'go'. The form nguba is made up of the bound pronoun
ng(i)- representing first person singular subject, and the suffix -uba which indicates that the tense is non-past and the action/event involves movement in a direction away from the speaker (see below).",[156]
"Nominals97The proprietive suffix can also be used to express accompaniment:
yarru balamurru-nguji.
iniyaga
g-uba
(4-175) Bungmaji
old.mani(NOM) that.I.SG.NOM 3SG.S-NP.AWY go(FUT) spear-PROP.I(NOM)
That old man will go with a spear.
Interestingly, some speakers restrict the proprietive suffix to having word scope, and
others use it with phrasal scope, marking the proprietive on all words of the NP. Thus, some
speakers (e.g. MH) considered the following examples to be perfectly grammatical (although
there are no such spontaneous examples in the corpus):
darranggu-nguji.
buguwa-nguji
(4-176) Alaji
boy.l(NOM) big.IV-PROP.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)`

(4-177) Yarru ng-a
1SG.S-PST bag-PROP.II(NOM) 1SG.POSS.II-PROP.II(NOM)
go
I went (taking) my bag.
However, one speaker in particular (MG) felt that they were completely ungrammatical and
that it was necessary to use a verbal clause instead, such as the following:34
darranggu.
buguwa
(4-178) Yabu gini-n
stick.IV(ACC)
3SG.M.A(PR)-PROG
big.IV(ACC)
have
He has a big stick.
Note that Dench and Evans (1988) give phrasal scope as an essential characteristic of case
suffixes, as opposed to derivational suffixes. As the proprietive suffix can have phrasal scope
for some speakers it considered for present purposes to meet this criterion for casehood.
However, further investigation is required.","[114, 115]"
"7.1.3 COMPARATIVE CLAUSES
These clauses are similar to ascriptive clauses; however, in these clauses attributes are
being compared rather than merely stated. Structurally, the only difference between this type
of clause and an ascriptive clause is that this clause requires an oblique NP (here ngarra)
representing the referent with which the comparison is being made.
(7-19)Bulyinginyamirnijî ngarra, (ngawurniji bugayi).little.I(NOM) 2SG.NOM ISG.OBL (1SG.NOM big.I(NOM))You're littler than me, (I'm big).
Another type of comparative clause is that expressing similarity or resemblance. Such
clauses in Wambaya make use of the particle ngaba and are discussed in §8.2.2.1. One
example is provided here:
(7-20)Bamarrangaba spoon.mouth.IV(NOM) THEN spoon(His) mouth is like a spoon.",[194]
"120 Chapter 4
much', `sometime, when' and `somehow, how'.60 There is a strong tendency for indefinite/
interrogatives to be initial in the clause.
As indicated by the term used, indefinite/interrogatives are found with two different
functions in the corpus: indefinite (4-249) and interrogative (4-250).61 In the former
function, they often co-occur with the enclitic -miji `INFER' (7.7.1.1).
(4-249) Gayina=mijiirr-adîdîma.

irr-a
didima.
something.IV(ACC) 3PL.A-PST tell
They told him something./What did they tell him?
Each of these examples expresses the fact that the speaker does not know what it was that
the subject told the object. As far as I can tell, the difference between the indefinite meaning
of example (4-249) and that of (4-250) is that in the former the speaker is indicating that
he/she is only inferring that anything was `told' at all. Such examples are often translated in
Aboriginal English using `must be', as in `I don't know what they told him, must be
something.'
I will now discuss each of these indefinite/interrogatives individually. A general
interrogative particle is discussed in §7.5.1.
4.7.1 GAY INI 'SOMEONE/SOMETHING, WHO/WHAT'
Like any other nominal modifier, this indefinite/interrogative is inflected to agree with its
referent in gender, case and number: when it is inflected with an animate gender suffix it is
translated `someone, who' and when it is inflected with an inanimate gender suffix it is
translated `something, what' or `which'. The forms found in the corpus are given in Table
4.17, followed by a discussion of the form and function of these indefinite/interrogatives,
and some examples of their use. As the nominative and accusative case forms are
homophonous, I have listed them together in the table.62

gayininî-ni
gayininî-nka.
Class II gayînirna gayinînga-nî gayininga-nka

Thus, the case suffixes are regular for nominals: -0 `NOM and ACC', -ni `LOC', and -nka
`DAT', as are the gender suffixes: -0/-ni- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `II ABS/NABS', -a `IV ABS60 For simplicity, in examples in this work I gloss each form according to the meaning it has in the
context in which it occurs.
61 Note that there are many other functions that indefinite/interrogatives commonly have in languages (see
for example Karcevski 1969, Wierzbicka 1980 and Mushin 1991, 1995); however these are the only two
functions that are found in my corpus for Wambaya.

temporally prior to the other clause, rather than following it as in most ngaba clauses (such as

Gajî is used to link two clauses with the meaning that the action described by the first
clause is carried out in order to prevent that of the second clause. This particle is found in the
speech of only one speaker (MH) and, since this speaker's dialect appears to consist primarily33 . The use of ngaba: in this function may be an example of the pragmatic ambiguity of conjunctions
discussed by Sweetser (1990:76ff). I am indebted to Nick Evans for this observation. Although Sweetser
does not discuss 'so that, so then' conjunctions such as ngaba, the fact that she finds that other
conjunctions function not only to link content items or logical premises. hut to link speech acts as well
(as in 'Where were you last night(?), and don't give me any nonsense about staying late at the officer
(p.112)), makes this polysemy of ngaba less surprising.

"4.4A2 PRIVATIVE SUFFIX
The privative suffix is the converse of the proprietive suffix; it is used to indicate that one
nominal `lacks' or is `without' the other. The pri vative suffix is also very commonly used
with verbs to derive a nominal meaning `one who cannot/does not do X'.
a) Form
There are a number of different allomorphs of the privative suffix. Firstly, the form of the
privative suffix must agree in gender with the noun or referent that it modifies. Secondly,
there are a number of different phonologically conditioned allomorphs in which the initial
segment of the suffix chan ges depending on the final segment of the stem.35 The different
absolutive gender forms are listed in Table 4.11.
34 The problem is not with the verbless sentence as MG accepts them as grammatical when the NP contains
only one proprietive nominal. For example:
Alaji
darranggu-nguji.
boy.l(NOM) stick-PROP.l(NOM)
The boy has a stick.
It is possible that this difference may reflect a dialectal difference between Gudanji and Wambaya: MG,
who rejects e.:amples in which the proprietive has phrasal scope, is a Wambaya speaker. MH, on the
other hand, who accepts such examples, speaks a dialect that is predominantly Gudanji (with some
W""ambaya mixed in). Th is will have to be explored further in the field.
35 The morphophonemic processes that generate these forms are discussed in §2.3.",[115]

of this particle in the corpus include the following:

such as Kayardild and Lardil.3
The four genders in Wambaya are masculine (Class I), feminine (Class II), vegetable
(Class III) and neuter (Class Iv). Class membership is primarily semantically based. There are
two series of gender suffixes: those which occur in the nominative and accusative cases
(absolutive) and those which occur in all other cases (non-absolutive).4 Gender is marked on
nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and some indefinite/interrogatives.
Wambaya is a `split-ergative' language: nominals (excluding free pronouns) have an
ergative-absolutive pattern of inflection while the free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
declension. Following Goddard (1982), the class of nominals as a whole is analysed as
having a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative and accusative (see §4.4).
A second position auxiliary, obligatorily present in most Wambaya clauses, contains
bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause. This auxiliary
also contains most of the tense, aspect and mood information for the clause, and can contain
directional affixes indicating movement towards or away from the speaker. Unusually, the
auxiliary has no root.
Some further unusual aspects of Wambaya grammar include: a subjective/objective
distinction that is made by some adjectives (see §3.1), a suffix found with kinship nominals
which appears to have a reflexive possessive function (see §4.5.1.2) and some verbs which
alternate in transitivity without changing their form (see §7.2.7).
As is common for Australian languages, Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and
the word order is relatively free.
1.1.1 THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGES
The West Barkly language family consists of 5 languages/dialects: Jingili, Ngarnga (or
Ngarnji), Wambaya, Gudanji and Binbinka. The structure of this family can be represented
as in Table 1.1 (following Chadwick 1978:2).

5Although the Tangkic languages were originally classified by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) as
Pama-Nyungan, recent discussions (namely Evans (1985, 1988, 1995a) and Blake (1988, 1990)) have
shown them to be clearly non-Pama-Nyungan.
These gender suffixes are then followed by the appropriate case suffix.
The terms 'Eastern Group' and 'McArthur' are taken from Chadwick (e.g. 1978).","[19, 20]"
"54Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of subcategorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically nontransparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
(1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
(usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The subcategorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
indicating the source or the direction of the motion).","[71, 72]"
"Such examples suggest that igima is a remote demonstrative since, as mentioned above,
remote demonstratives are used to refer to something mentioned in earlier discourse that is
either a substantial distance away, or precedes the intervention of another topic.
Perhaps these are generic nouns, meaning something along the lines of `male being',
`female being' and 'thing' that can either modify a noun (perhaps for the purposes of
emphasis or clarification), or can stand alone in the NP, in which case they are interpreted as
third person markers (e.g. remote demonstratives). This would explain the fact that they can
modify a head noun in. the NP, and themselves be modified by adjectives as the head of an NP
and co-occur with both a noun and a demonstrative within the one NP. It does not explain,
however, the fact that their form (i.e. the existence of a gender prefix and the demonstrative
form of the plural suffix) is more like a demonstrative than a noun. These forms only really
differ from true demonstratives in their stem -gi-/-ga-:

'that.one.I.SG.NOMJACC', nagarna is glossed `that.one.ILSG.NOM/ACC, and so on.
4.7 LNDEFLNITE/INTERROGATIVES58
There are five indefinite/interrogative roots in the corpus, which are used to indicate that
the (full) identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. These forms are frequently used
in interrogative function, requesting the information about the referent's identity from the
addressee. This interrogative function, however, cannot be considered a part of the core
meaning of these forms as they can be used contexts that are not compatible with an
interrogative meaning, namely those in which they co-occur with the inferential enclitic =mijî
(see below).59 When combined with their various inflections, these five roots cover the
meanings 'someone, who', 'something, what', 'something, which', `for something, why',
'somewhere, where', `from somewhere, where from', 'some amount, how many/how57 The alternation in the vowel of the stem is triggered by the following high back vowel of the dual suffix.
58 In Nordlinger 1993a I used the term 'ignorative' for this word class (following Karcevski 1969 and more
recently Wierzbicka (e.g. 1980)). However, as Mushin (1991, 1995)
.
has pointed out, there are two
components to these words: an ignorative component (which indicates that knowledge is at issue) and an
epistemological component (which characterises the type of knowledge at issue). For this reason the
more neutral term 'indefinite/interrogative' has been chosen. In other discussions of Australian languages
these words have been referred to as `interrogatives' (e.g. Dixon 1972, 1977, Merlan 1994), 'interrogative/indefinite pronouns' (e.g. Austin 1981a, Morphy, 1983), 'indefinite pronouns' (Dench 1995),
'indeterminates' (Donaldson 1980) and 'epistememes' (Mushin 1991, 1995).
59 This discussion has benefited from McGregor's (1990:146ff) discussion of such forms in Gooniyandi.",[137]
