"Answers to questions19.4.1. Answers to polar questions
With respect to polar questions, Toqabaqita has an agree/disagree answer system, sometimes in combination with an echo system (Sadock and Zwicky
1985). A positive (agree) answer pro-sentence element is used when the polarity of the answer agrees with the polarity of the question, and a negative construction is used when the polarity of the answer disagrees with the polarity of
the question. In a pure echo system, “… no special answer words are used at
all. Simple positive and negative responses to questions involve repeating the
verb of the question, with or without additional material ....” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985: 191). In Toqabaqita, pro-sentence answer elements are sometimes combined with echo answers; alternatively, an echo answer may occur by
itself, without a pro-sentence element.
There are four “agree” pro-sentence lexemes and one “disagree” type construction. For convenience, the agree lexemes are glossed ‘yes’ and the disagree
construction is glossed ‘no’, ‘(it is) not’, but these glosses do not fully correspond to the meanings of yes and no (because the English system is not of the
agree/disagree type). The gloss ‘yes’ will be in double quotes (“yes”) when the
agree elements occur in sentences that are answers to negative-polarity questions. The agree elements are listed in (19-149):
(19-149)agree pro-sentence lexemes: iu, aqaa, mania, uaqaOf these, iu and aqaa are most common, with iu somewhat more common
than aqaa, while uaqa is least common. (All four all also used to express acknowledgement with what somebody else is saying, and iu, aqaa and mania are
also used to link sentences; see examples [27-55] and [27-56] in section
27.3.2.)
The disagree construction consists of the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be
the case’ (section 17.3) with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker.
The subject marker and the verb normally form one phonological word, with
the stress falling on the subject marker (section 2.5).",[882]

Replies to negative-polarity polar questions are discussed next. In sentences
that are replies to negative-polarity questions, echoing of the interrogative is
more common than in sentences that are replies to positive-polarity questions,
especially when the reply is of the disagree type. When the reply is of the agree
type, an agree element may occur by itself, or an echo may occur by itself, or an
agree element and an echo may be combined. In (19-162) only an agree lexeme
is used.",[885]

When a sentence that is a reply to a negative-polarity polar question contains an echo, the echo is grammatically negative, as is the question. The echo
is grammatically negative not because the answer is of the disagree type but
because it is an echo of a negative interrogative. A negative echo and an agree
pro-sentence element can cooccur, as in (19-163):

The default answer to an alternative question picks up one of the alternatives.
The interrogative sentence in (19-168) is a “complex” one (section 19.5), expressing a polar question (‘did you go?’) followed by an alternative one where
the second alternative is a negation of the first alternative (‘did you bring a
possum or not?’). The answer is an agree-type echo to the polar question and it
picks the negative alternative:

It is, of course, possible for the person to whom an alternative question is

Here the expected answer relates to the interrogative phrase. Positive responses
are discussed and illustrated first. The response may be a complete sentence or

A minimal negative response to an open question is expressed by means of
the negative verb aqi ‘not exist’ with the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker. Quite commonly, the assertive particle boqo is present as well.

"IntroductionToqabaqita has only a small number of types of elements used to express negation. In the present-day language there are only two types commonly used:
negative subject markers and a negative verb. There is also a set of archaic
dehortative markers (section 20.3.2). Negation concerning (types of) participants is also achieved by means of negative existential sentences (section
26.1.2.2). In spite of the relative paucity of the types of negative elements (or
perhaps because of it), the area of negation is rather complex.
With one exception (see [17-4] further below), negation in Toqabaqita can
be characterized as predicate negation, for the following reasons. First, the
negative subject markers occur inside the verb phrase. And second, the negative
verb heads a predicate, even though clauses that contain the negative verb are
not always fully-fledged clauses.
There are three basic negative strategies in Toqabaqita: (i) a simple negative
construction, where negation is expressed by means of the negative subject
markers alone; (ii) a lexical negative verb ‘not be so, not be the case’, ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’; and (iii) a double negative construction, which consists
of a negative event clause preceded by a “mini-clause” that contains the negative verb. These strategies are exemplified in (17-1), (17-2), and (17-3), respectively:

2SGThere is one construction where the negation is not of the predicate type:

NEG be.afraid

‘That man (is) a man (who is) not afraid.’ ‘That man is a man without fear.’The simple negative constructionIn the simple negative construction, negation is achieved solely by means of the
negative subject markers. These are listed in table 4.5 in section 4.8. The negative subject markers both express negation and index the subject. With one
exception they are bimorphemic: the first element encodes the subject, and the
second element the negation.

naqa, ....
PERSMKR

PRF
‘[The people looked and looked (around),] (but) the boy had not
arrived, ....’The negative marker si is glossed 3SG.NEG when it occurs in predicate negation, when the subject is third person (singular). And even though all of the
other negative subject markers are decomposable into two elements, for the
sake of simplicity they are treated as unanalyzed wholes in the examples; for
instance, misi 1PL(EXCL).NEG, rather than mi-si 1PL(EXCL)-NEG (see [17-5]
above).
There is only one set of negative subject markers, and so the futurenonfuture tense distinction found in grammatically positive clauses (section736Negation15.1) is neutralized in negative clauses. The next pair of examples illustrates
the use of the negative subject markers in clauses with future-time reference
and past-time reference, respectively.

IDENTAnd in negative clauses there is no explicit marking of the imperfective
aspect, which in positive clauses uses the same set of subject markers that also
signal future tense (although, as discussed in sections 15.1.3 and 15.2.2, the
imperfective subject markers are not obligatory in expressions of the imperfective aspect).
The negative subject markers are also used in negative imperatives (section
20.3.1):
(17-9)Qosi
waela qani nau.
GENP 1SG
2SG.NEG laugh
‘Don’t laugh at me.’While the simple negative construction is not at all uncommon, it is more
common to use the double negative construction, discussed in section 17.4. The
double construction is especially common when the event clause has a third
person singular subject. There the simple strategy, using only the subject
marker, is quite rare, with two types of exception. That is, sentences like the
one in (17-10) are not particularly common.

be.goodSee also (17-6) further above.
In one type of construction only simple negation is possible, not double negation. This is the case in non-predicate negation, where the verb complex
functions as a modifier of a noun:17.2 The simple negative construction(17-11)737fanua
si
rodo
NEG be.dark
place
‘place (that is) not dark’, ‘place without darkness’ (referring to
Christian heaven)For another example see (17-4) above.
The other type of construction in which the third-person negative subject
marker is normally used in the simple negative strategy expresses “negative
additiveness”. In negative additiveness, one state of affairs is characterized as
not being accompanied by one or more other states of affairs, usually contrary
to expectation, contrary to what is normally the case. The first clause is positive, while the following clause or clauses is/are negative. The first clause expresses a situation that obtains, and the second, negated clause asserts that another situation that might or should have obtained prior to it, simultaneously
with it, or instead of it, is, in fact, not taking place or did not, in fact, take place.
With one type of exception (see further below), the subjects of the two clauses
must be the same, but the negative clause/clauses does/do not contain a subject
phrase. The clauses are normally in asyndetic coordination.

When expressing negative additiveness, a clause with a meteorological verb
occurs without a subject even if its (notional) subject is different from the subject of the preceding clause.

"19.2.1. Polar interrogatives
Polar interrogatives express questions that can be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’,
although other answers are possible as well, such as ‘maybe’ or ‘I don’t know’.
However, ‘no’ answers are not defining of polar questions in Toqabaqita, because questions asked by means of open interrogatives also can be answered
with ‘no’. It is ‘yes’ and ‘maybe’ answers that are unique to polar questions.
(See section 19.4 for answers to questions.)19.2 Closed interrogatives791The structure of polar interrogatives is no different from the structure of
(simple) declarative sentences. The only difference is in the intonation. While
in declaratives there is normally a fall in intonation towards the end of the sentence, in polar interrogatives there is a rise in intonation towards the end. The
sentence in (19-1) with falling intonation at the end is declarative, while structuraly identical (19-2) with a rise in intonation at the end is interrogative:
(19-1)Qe

3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
‘It [food] is cooked/done now.’(19-2)Qe

3SG.NFUT be.cooked PRF
‘Is it cooked/done now?’Polar interrogatives can be elliptical sentence fragments:
(19-3)Qa-muqa?
POSS-2SG.PERS‘Yours?’ (Asking about food.)
A polar interrogative may contain a topicalized, fronted element:
(19-4)Wela baa ki,
qo
riki-da?
2SG.NFUT see-3PL.OBJ
child that PL
‘The children, did you see them?’A polar interrogative can be joined with a non-interrogative clause in a complex sentence. In (19-5) the interrogative clause is coordinated with a declarative clause :
(19-5)Nau ku
lae naqa, ma ni
PRF and PROFORE
1SG 1SG.NFUT go
‘I am going now, and (how about) you?’kamuluqa?
2PLAnd in (19-6) the interrogative clause forms the apodosis of a conditional
sentence:

1PL(EXCL).SEQ arriveqi
LOCqusungadi,

leqa
ba-na?
3SG.SEQ be.good LIM-3SG.PERS
‘If we come tomorrow, will that be all right? (lit.: will that only be
good?)’ ‘If we came tomorrow, would that be good?’
Without any formal difference, positive polar interrogatives may express
neutral questions, where the speaker has no particular expectations about
whether the answer will be positive or negative, or they can express biased
questions, where the speaker has an expectation that the answer will be positive. The question expressed in (19-7) is neutral:
(19-7)Qo
riki-a
faela baa?
2SG.NFUT see-3.OBJ file that
‘Have you seen the file [a tool]?’On the other hand, the question expressed in (19-8) is biased. The question
is directed at a person who is getting ready to leave. The speaker expects the
answer to be positive and seeks confirmation:
(19-8)Qoki
lae naqa neri?
PRF NPAST.HERE
2SG.FUT go
‘Are you going now?’Sometimes the speaker is fully certain that the state of affairs is indeed such
and such and is seeking neither information nor confirmation. Rather a positive
polar interrogative serves a phatic communion function. Quite commonly, people when seeing that a state of affairs is such and such will use a polar interrogative as if they were inquiring about that state of affairs. Such interrogatives
typically serve as a way to initiate conversation or as a greeting. The sentence
in (19-9) was addressed to a man who was clearly making copra:
(19-9)Qo
kafara
2SG.NFUT make.copra
‘Are you making copra?’nena?
NPAST.THEREAnd the interrogative in (19-10) was addressed to a person who was passing
by on his way down (towards the coast) and was intended as a greeting:
(19-10)Qo
sifo
nena?
2SG.NFUT descend NPAST.THERE
‘Are you going down?’19.2 Closed interrogatives793Positive polar interrogatives are also used when the speaker is not seeking
information from the addressee because he/she does not expect the addressee to
have the information. Rather, the speaker is contemplating the possibility that
such and such may be the case or is wondering whether such and such might be
the case. Such interrogatives function to express a relatively high degree of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker about a state of affairs. They employ the
element mada ‘or’, which elsewhere functions as a conjunction and also to
introduce the protases of conditional sentences, and they may also contain the
particle toqo ‘perhaps’, ‘probably’, ‘possibly’ (section 18.5.1). In (19-11) toqo
is present:
(19-11)Mada
e
sifo
toqo?
or
3SG.NFUT descend perhaps
‘Did he perhaps go down [to the coast]?’For a pair of examples without toqo see (18-60a) and (18-60b) in section
18.5.3.
In contrast to positive polar interrogatives, negative polar interrogatives are
normally used to seek confirmation. A negative state of affairs is unexpected or
unusual, and the speaker wishes to have it confirmed that the situation is indeed
such and such. For example, on arriving at a household in the morning and not
seeing Ulufaalu (a man) around, the person surmises that Ulufaalu is still asleep
and asks:
(19-12)Ulufaalu
qe=aqi

Ulufaalu
3SG.NFUT=NEGV 3SG.NEG be.awake
‘Ulufaalu is not awake?’By saying (19-13), the speaker expresses her surprise at not seeing Fiona
and the others around:
(19-13)Fiona kesi
fula

ANTCONT
Fiona
3PL.NEG arrive
‘Haven’t Fiona ’n them arrived yet?’19.2.2. Alternative interrogatives
Alternative interrogatives express questions that “provide a list from which, the
speaker suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:
179). In Toqabaqita, the alternatives in such a list are joined by means of the
conjunction mada ‘or’ (sections 11.2.2 and 28.4). There is normally a fall in794Interrogativesintonation at the end of an alternative interrogative. The alternatives may be
clausal, where it is clauses that are joined by mada, or subclausal, where clause
constituents are joined rather than whole clauses. In the first example below the
alternatives are expressed in noun phrases:
(19-14)Qo
thathami-a alo mada kai?
yam
2SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ taro or
‘Do you want the taro or the yam?’As far as clausal alternatives are concerned, two main subtypes can be distinguished. In one, the clauses encode independent alternative propositions,
while in the other type the proposition of the second clause is a negation of the
proposition of the first clause. The subtype with independent alternatives is
illustrated in (19-15):
(19-15)Qo
raa mada
qoki

2SG.IPFV sleep

1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
‘I am not hungry.’However, the double construction is also commonly used in non-emphatic
negation.
There is one grammatical difference between the simple and the general
double negative constructions that concerns the expression of the subject. In the
simple construction, the event clause may have a subject noun phrase, lexical or
pronominal, in addition to the negative subject marker:
(17-34)Toqa
baa kesi
fula.
people that 3PL.NEG arrive
‘The people did not arrive.’(17-35)Nau kwasi
thaofa.
1SG 1SG.NEG be.hungry
‘I am not hungry.’On the other hand, in the double construction, no subject noun phrase is
possible in the event clause. The only way the relevant participant may be encoded by a noun phrase is as a topic preceding the mini-clause with the negative verb aqi:
(17-36)
NP(TOPIC)i [subject.marker aqi] [negative.subject.markeri verb ...]
This is illustrated by the grammaticality of (17-37a) and the ungrammaticality of (17-37b):
(17-37)a. Nau qe=aqi

thaofa.

clause, and the grammatical (17-35), with the subject in the simple negative

Topic noun phrases are not obligatory with the double negative construction,
as illustrated in (17-38), which is synonymous with (17-37a) (and with [1735]):
(17-38)Qe=aqi

thaofa.
3SG.NFUT=NEGV 1SG.NEG be.hungry
‘I am not hungry.’The noun phrase that precedes the aqi mini-clause is not its subject; it is a
topic phrase. The subject marker of aqi can only be third-person singular, regardless of the grammatical person and number of the preceding noun phrase.
In (17-37a) further above, that noun phrase is first person singular, and in (1739) below it is first person plural exclusive.

‘We did not see the child.’
In the sequential double negative construction too there is a prohibition
against a subject phrase in the event clause. The relevant participant can only
be expressed in the topic position. This is the case in (17-40). There the topic
pronominal noun phrase is third person plural, but the sequential subject marker
in the aqi clause can only be third person singular.

Although the double negative constructions are composed of an event clause
and a mini-clause with the negative verb aqi, and although the noun phrase (if
there is one) coreferential with the subject marker of the event clause is a topic,
not a subject, the facts of the matter are not quite straightforward. First, the
subject marker of aqi can only be third-person singular and it does not have a
referent. And second, there is prosodic evidence that argues against full clausal
status of the aqi “clause”. Some of the evidence concerns both the general and
the sequential constructions, while other evidence concerns only the former.
The prosodic evidence is as follows.
First, in the general double negative construction the nonfuture subject
marker qe and the negative verb aqi typically fuse phonologically into one
word, and, as is the case with words, stress falls on the first syllable: [!'p!+].
Such fusion and stress shift also sometimes take place when aqi functions as a
lexical verb, in particular in simple negative responses to questions, where qe
aqi alone (or possibly with a postverbal particle) constitues the response: ‘No’;
see (17-2) in section 17.1 for an example. On the other hand, although the sequential subject marker ka may cliticize onto the verb aqi in the sequential
negative construction, the stress is retained on the first syllable of the verb:
[kap!+]. The fusion of qe and aqi as [!'p!+] is indicated in the examples. This is
the only type of fusion that does not involves shortening of one or both of the
elements that is indicated, because it may be indicative of a major change in
progress (see further below).
Second, neither in the general nor in the sequential negative construction
does the aqi mini-clause have its own intonation contour, while this is often the
case with the first of two conjoined clauses elsewhere (section 28.1). Rather,
the mini-clause and the event clause fall intonationally together under one contour.
Third, neither in the general nor in the sequential constructions, if there is a
topic noun phrase preceding the aqi clause, does the topic normally receive its
own intonation contour nor is it normally separated from the aqi mini-clause by
a pause, while both are often the case with topics elsewhere (section 38.2).
And fourth, the tight structural link between an aqi mini-clause and the following event clause is evidenced by the fact that in relativization on a constituent of the event clause the aqi mini-clause is included in the relative construction together with the event clause. In (17-41) in relativization on the direct
object of the event clause, the relative clause marker na (realized as n= because
of fusion) comes before the aqi mini-clause:17.5 Emphatic negation(17-41)Tha

‘That guy had come up with an idea that we just did not understand
well.’
The prosodic evidence and the evidence from relativization show that in the
double negative construction the aqi mini-clause is not a fully-fledged clause.
And the prosodic evidence and the restriction on the subject markers (only the
nonfuture and the sequential subject markers are possible) jointly show that aqi
is not a fully-fledged verb there. It is conceivable that what we see here is a
stage in Jespersen’s cycle (Jespersen 1917), whereby the simple negative construction, which uses only the negative subject markers, was at some point in
history “strengthened” by the addition of a negative, aqi mini-clause, whose
clausal status is now being eroded. The fact that the double negative construction serves to express somewhat more emphatic negation but is not necessarily
emphatic is consistent with this scenario. And the less-than-full status of the
“topic” phrase before the aqi clause may be evidence of that position becoming
a subject position, as the originally bi-clausal structure is turning into a monoclausal one. And if indeed this kind of development is taking place, it has progressed further in the general negative construction than in the sequential one:
qe=aqi is further on its way to becoming reanalyzed as a unitary negation
marker than ka aqi is.","[797, 798, 799, 800]"
"The double negative constructionA clause may be negated grammatically solely by means of a negative subject
marker. There is, however, also a complex, double negative construction that
consists of an event clause negated by means of a negative subject marker preceded by a “mini-clause” that consists of the negative verb aqi and a third person singular subject marker. Furthermore, the aqi mini-clause may be preceded
by a noun phrase that corresponds to the subject of the event clause. The event
clause cannot contain a subject phrase. Two subtypes of the double negative
construction need to be distinguished, depending on the subject marker in the
aqi mini-clause. In one, the subject marker is the third person singular nonfuture form qe. For convenience, this construction will be referred to as the “general” double negative construction. Its structure is shown schematically in (1724):

asked me to give her something,] I would not hand it to her directly
(lit.: I would not touch her hand[s]).’ (I would put it on the ground
and she would pick it up.)
In the other subtype, the subject marker in the aqi mini-clause is the third
person singular sequential form ka. This type of negative construction is joined
to a preceding clause or sentence, with or without the coordinating construction
ma ‘and’. This construction is used to express unfulfilled expectation: a situation expressed or implied in preceding discourse did/does not obtain. For convenience, this kind of construction will be referred to as the “sequential” double
negative construction. Its structure is shown schematically in (17-27):

The sequential negative construction is discussed in section 16.3, where
more examples can be found. As also shown there, in clauses expressing unfulfilled expectations aqi also functions as a lexical verb when there is no negative
event clause:

IRR17.4 The double negative construction743In general, negation expresses denial of a presupposition or contradiction
(Givón 1984), which in itself does not distinguish between the general negative
construction and the sequential one. However, there are several types of difference between the two. First, the two constructions use different third person
singular subject markers in the aqi mini-clause: nonfuture and sequential, respectively. Second, the sequential construction is usually structurally closely
integrated with the preceding discourse. More often than not, it and the preceding clause(s) are part of the same sentence. On the other hand, there is often no
such integration in the case of the general negative construction. Sentences with
the general construction may be used without any prior relevant discourse:
(17-31)Qe
aqi
qosi
2SG.NEG
3SG.NFUT NEGV
‘Aren’t you hungry?’thaofa?
be.hungry(For the use of negative polar interrogatives see section 19.2.1.)
Third, in the case of the sequential negative construction, the expected situation is either explicitly expressed or strongly implied in a preceding clause,
while the presupposition denied or contradicted by the general construction
need not be. For one thing, there need not be any directly relevant preceding
discourse. Fourth, the general double negative construction has a simple counterpart, where negation is achieved by the negative subject markers alone. The
sequential negative construction has no such counterpart. And finally, there are
also prosodic differences between the two constructions. These are discussed
further below.
With the exception of non-predicate negation, where the verb complex functions as a noun modifier, the general double negative strategy is available wherever the simple strategy is. The double negative construction is strongly preferred over the simple one if the subject of the negative event clause is thirdperson singular. In (17-32) the double construction is used in the first part of
the sentence, where the event clause has a third-person singular subject, and the
simple construction is used in the final clause, which has a first-person singular
subject:

‘She would not face me, (and) I would not face her.’ (In earlier
times, this was the proper way for a man and a woman who were not
husband and wife to be positioned when speaking to each other.)744NegationThe double construction may be used when the negation is to be made somewhat emphatic. For example, a person is more likely to use (17-33a) rather than
(17-33b) if he or she wants to emphasize that they are not hungry:
(17-33)a.","[794, 795, 796, 797]"
"27.2.5. Negative counterparts of grammatically positive verbless sentences
Negative counterparts of grammatically positive verbless sentences employ the
negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’ (sections 17.3). The verb always
has the third person singular nonfuture subject marker. Only lexical subjects
occur in this type of construction. In addition to the subject, there may be a27.2 Major verbless sentence types943topic phrase. The basic structure of this type of construction is shown in (2734):
(27-34)(topic) [subject qe
aqi …]
3SG.NFUT not.be.the.caseThe topic phrase corresponds to the subject of a grammatically positive
verbless sentence, and the subject phrase to the predicate. For example:

workaraqi
mature.manloo],
[raa

neri], ....
3SG.NFUT not.be.so NPAST.HERE
‘God’s work is not a person’s work, ….’ (Lit.: ‘The work of the mature man up there, the work of a person is not the case, ….’)
In (27-36) the topic of the clause with the negative verb aqi is present (nga
doo neqe ‘this thing’), but that noun phrase is absent from the subject position
of the following verbless clause (nga doo qeeqeta neqe ‘a different thing’).

‘Hey, this thing is not a human being; it is something else (lit.: a different thing).’
In (27-37) the topic of the clause with the negative verb aqi is expressed in
the preceding clause (teqe kini ‘a woman’), not in the topic position associated
with the aqi clause. The clause after the aqi clause is grammatically positive
and subjectless; the subject, if present, would refer to the woman.

in (27-38), where the phrase toqa qi Toqabaqita ‘people at Toqabaqita’ has
been extraposed. The first person plural exclusive pronoun kamiliqa is in the
topic position, and is in apposition to the preceding noun phrase nau ma fulingana maka nau ki ‘I and, um, my [classificatory] fathers’. The negative verb is
accompanied by the additive postverbal particle laqu.

Basically the same strategy is also used to express negation in the focus
position, except that there is no topic constituent there; see section 39.2, examples (39-25) and (39-26).
And a similar strategy is used to negate verbless fragments of clauses from
which the verb complex (the verb and the associated particles) has been omitted. The clause fragment functions as a topic; there is no subject phrase with
the negative verb.

"Emphatic negationIn Toqabaqita, predicate negation can be made stronger, more emphatic in one
of several ways. The double negative construction can, but need not, carry relatively light emphatic force; see (17-33a) and (17-33b) in the preceding section.
Commonly, negation is (further) strengthened by means of the postverbal assertive/intensifying particle boqo (section 5.2.8). In (17-42) boqo is used in a simple negative construction, in (17-43) in a double negative construction, and in
(17-44) with aqi, which functions as a lexical verb there:748Negation(17-42)Kwasi riki-a.

(For negative answers to open questions see section 19.4.3.)
Negation using the verb aqi as a lexical verb ‘not be so, not be the case’,
‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ can be made more emphatic by means of the perfect marker/intensifier naqa (sections 5.2.12 and 15.3). This strategy is not
available to the simple or the double negative constructions. Sometimes, naqa
does mark the perfect with aqi:

However, frequently some degree of emphasis is present in addition to the

But it is possible for naqa to express strong negation, without any sense of
the perfect. The three expressions in (17-47) can all function as answers to polar interrogatives. The one in (a) is neutral, the one in (b) relatively emphatic,
and the one in (c) highly emphatic:

The timitive marker ada can combine with the purpose markers fasi or uri,
even though the latter does not mark negative purpose by itself. Fasi or uri
come directly before ada. Fasi can occur with or without the object suffix, uri
only with the suffix. With these complex negative-purpose markers, it is ada,
not fasi or uri, that determines the grammatical polarity of the purpose clause
and the type of subject marker in the purpose clause: the clause is grammatically positive and the subject marker can only be sequential.

Instead of a finite purpose clause, it is possible to use, under certain conditions,
a non-finite construction headed by a nominalization (section 9.1). First, such
purpose constructions can be used only if the notional subject of the nominalization is coreferential with the subject or, with a few verbs, the direct object of
the clause in which the purpose nominalization occurs. Nominalizations can
only be grammatically positive, and so only positive purpose can be expressed
in this way. Although finite positive purpose clauses can be the complements of
the purpose subordinators fasi or uri, purpose nominalizations can only be the
complement of the purpose preposition uri, with the object suffix -a, or of its
reduced variant ura (section 10.3.2), or of the reduced form of the general
preposition qana (section 10.3.7), not of the preposition fasi, which is ablative
(section 10.3.3). Uri-a is the most commonly used form, while qana is the least
common one (although it is by no means rare). For the details concerning the
expression of the notional arguments of nominalizations see section 9.1.3., specifically table 9.1.","[1214, 1215]"
"20.4.3. Purpose imperatives with the verb lae ‘go’ in the first clause
As discussed in section 33.3.3, clauses with the verb lae ‘go’ as the first clause
in a construction that expresses or implies purpose (‘go in order to X’) often
lack a subject marker. This is also the case in positive imperatives that express
purpose where the first imperative clause contains lae, regardless of the grammatical person and number of the subject. It is the second clause, if any, that
contains a subject marker.

Imperatives normally contain a verb, but verbless imperatives are possible. One
type of verbless imperative consists of an independent personal pronoun that
encodes the addressee(s) and a directional particle in the predicate. Only the
direction of the motion is encoded, not the manner in which the motion is to
take place.
(20-61)Kulu
kau.
PL(INCL) AND
‘Let’s be off.’In the next example, the first sentence is a verbless imperative, while the
second one is an imperative with a verb:
(20-62)Kamuluqa mai! Mulu
VENT 2PL.NFUT
2PLlau-a
stop.fight-3.OBJfiru-a
fight-DVNnaqi!
this
‘You, (come) here! Stop the fight!’
Instead of a (true) verb, an imperative may contain a pseudo-verb, a phrase
that has been re-ranked to function like a verb (section 4.7). The sentences in
(20-63) and (20-64) are imperatives, positive and negative, respectively, that
contain pseudo-verbs. The predicate of the positive imperative in (20-63) consists of the noun phrase rodo leqa ‘good night’ and a sequential subject marker.
The expression qoko rodo leqa is a parting formula.
(20-63)Qoko
rodo leqa,
wane nau.
2SG.SEQ night be.good man 1SG
‘Good night (to you), my man.’ (Lit.: ‘You be good-night, my
man.’)And in the negative imperative below, the predicate consists of the noun
phrase quna qeri ‘this manner’ and the second-person singular negative subject
marker:
(20-64)Qosi
quna
qeri.
2SG.NEG manner this
‘Not like this.’ ‘Don’t do (it) like this.’ ‘Don’t do (it) this/that way.’20.4 Other properties of imperatives85920.4.5. Indirect imperatives
Indirect imperatives are imperatives that express directives, without being
overtly, in terms of their structure, directed at one or more addressees. Their
interpretion as having a directive force is highly context-dependent. The sentence in (20-65) with the negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’ (section
17.3) is intended to express admonishment coupled with dissuasion. The
speaker is admonishing the addressee who was about to take two malaria pills
at one time.
(20-65)Roo si
doo qe=aqi!
two PRTT thing 3SG.NFUT=not.be.the.case
‘Not two of them!’ (Lit.: ‘Two things, it is not the case.’)Utterances whose function is to direct other people’s behaviour may consist
of a verb phrase or a noun phrase that expresses the state of affairs that the
speaker objects to and wants stopped. The sentence in (20-66) consists of a
verb alone. This is not a positive imperative addressed to a single addressee. It
is an exclamation directed at a group of children who were making loud, annoying noise. The speaker is signalling to them that he wants the noise stopped or
at least lessened.
(20-66)Alifeo!
make.noise
‘Making (too much) noise!’ ‘(Yes,) make noise!’ (Sarcastically.)And nominalizations can be used with a “stance” function (section 9.1.3) to
express disapproval with a state of affairs, sometimes expressing one’s wish
that that state of affairs not take place any longer.
(20-67)Qaa! Ngata-laa sula doo qoro
qeri!
hey! talk-NMLZ PROL thing be.many that
‘Hey! All this talking about the things!’ ‘Hey! Too much talking
about the things!’ (Lit.: ‘Hey! Talking about those many things!’)For another example see (9-76) in section 9.1.3.","[910, 911, 912]"
"ANTCONTASRT body-3PL.OBJ‘Some of the animals that I saw, I had not seen them in reality before.’ (Lit.: ‘Some animals that I looked and saw, I had not yet seen
their bodies.’)

kani-a.
some.PL people PL 3PL.SEQ tie-3SG.OBJ
‘Some of the men hand the thatching panels (to others), (and) some
of the people tie them down.’ (Describing what men do when building a house.)
The notion of subsets can also be expressed by means of the quantifier
tootoqe (see section 6.8.7).
The use of tai and ta in negative clauses is considered next. With the exception of negative existential clauses where the noun phrase that contains tai designates the type of entity that does not exist, tai functions as an existential
quantifier (‘some not’), just as it does in positive sentences: the negation applies to some but not all of the relevant entities. Compare the positive sentence
in (6-324) and the negative sentence in (6-325) below. In both cases tai signifies subsets:

subject phrases, before the negative elements. In (6-344) sui has the negation in

"Laqu additive, restitutiveThe particle laqu has two basic functions, additive and restitutive.18 In the additive function, laqu expresses the fact that a certain situation obtains, or, with
negation, does not obtain, in addition to some other situation, and/or that a certain participant is involved in the same situation or the same type of situation
that one or more other participants are involved in, in the same role. The exact
meaning of laqu in the additive function varies in different contexts, and there
are also some differences between positive and negative sentences. The additive function of laqu in positive sentences is discussed first.
Frequently, although by no means always, the relevant situations are in temporal sequence. Thus, laqu may be used to express the fact that a certain type of
situation occurs again, after a previous occurrence of the same kind of situation,
with exactly the same participant(s). Here one can speak of the same type of
situation being repeated.

In the present-day language, negative imperatives are expressed by means of
the same negative strategies used in declarative sentences, using the negative
subject markers (chapter 17). Both the simple and the double negative constructions, the latter employing the negative verb aqi, occur in imperatives. The double negative strategy is somewhat more emphatic than the simple strategy. The
next two examples illustrate the simple and the double constructions, respectively:
(20-38)Qosi

‘Don’t laugh at me.’(20-39)Qe=aqi
mosi
3SG.NFUT=NEGV 2DU.NEG
‘Don’t interrupt each other.’kwai-talami.
LIP-interruptNegative imperatives too can be used with a variety of illocutionary forces,
such as orders and commands (as in the two examples just above), advice,
warnings, requests, entreaties, dehortations, and dissuasions. They can be used
either to prevent a new state of affairs from coming about or to stop a state of
affairs that already exists or that has existed previously. In the latter type of
case, the verb is often reduplicated when the state of affairs has existed for a
relatively extended period of time or when it has occurred on multiple occasions previously. (Reduplication of verbs serves to express the continuative/iterative aspect; see section 15.2.3.) Like positive imperatives, negative
imperatives are most common with second-person subjects, but subjects of
other grammatical persons are possible as well. Examples (20-40) – (20-44)
have second-person subjects.

"Counterfactual near future in the past: avertiveThe two transitive verbs that function to signal open near future, karangi-a and
karafi-a, can also serve to express the fact that a state of affairs nearly obtained
in the past but did not. The event clause contains the irrealis marker sa (sections 18.2 and 18.3), which precedes the subject marker. If the event clase is
grammatically positive, the subject marker is future-tense. Negative event
clauses have a negative subject marker; see (15-33) further below. Apart from
the presence of the irrealis marker in the event clause, all the other grammatical
properties of the constructions are the same as those expressing open near future.
As discussed in section 5.1.7 there is a preverbal avertive particle ota, which
too signals that a state of affairs nearly obtained in the past but in the end did690Tense and aspectnot. However, this particle is used only rarely. Much more commonly it is the
near future construction with karangi-a (or karafi-a) in the higher clause and
the irrealis marker in the event clause that expresses the avertive meaning. As
with the open near future construction, the form karafi-a is used only rarely to
express the avertive meaning, karangi-a being the usual form. The intransitive
verbs kwaikarangi and kwaikarafi do not serve to express the avertive meaning.
A few examples of sentences with the avertive meaning are given below.

The lexical verb aqi is used in a bi-clausal construction to signal that a potential situation will/should not obtain because of some disabling conditions
(section 17.6). It is also used in negative counterparts of grammatically positive
verbless sentences, and to negate fragments of clauses from which the verb
complex has been omitted; see section 27.2.5.
Occasionally, although only relatively rarely, the final vowel of aqi is realized as [']. This may happen when the third person singular nonfuture subject
marker qe and aqi fuse together as one phonological word, in particular as a
negative answer to a question: [!'pa!'] ‘No’. (For fusion of qe and aqi see further below in the next section.)17.4.","[793, 794]"
"Other expressions of uncertaintyToqabaqita has several other means to express speaker’s less-than-full certainty, or indeed uncertainty, about the factual status of a proposition. Two of
these are clause-level particles, one involves the conjunction ‘or’ in positive or
negative clauses, and two are sentence pro-forms.",[824]
"IntroductionImperative sentences serve to express various kinds of directives (Lyons 1977;
Searle 1979, 1983), such as orders, commands, demands, requests, advice, instructions, exhortations, persuasions, incitements, and invitations (Hamblin
1987). Most commonly, imperatives are used to get the addressee or addressees
to do something, but they may be directed at individuals other than the addresee(s): at a third person or at the speaker himself/herself. This chapter is concerned with clausal structures, imperatives, that function to express various
kinds of directives. In the present context the term “imperative” is used only
with reference to clauses that function as main clauses, not to clauses embedded under higher verbs that signal the illocutionary force; that is, with reference
to sentences such as the one in (20-1), but not sentences such as the one in (202).

‘I want you to help me.’Toqabaqita has a variety of grammatical means to form imperatives. However, as will be seen in what follows, in almost all cases the grammatical elements used to form imperatives have other functions as well. These include the
subject markers: nonfuture, future, sequential, negative, dehortative, and, in two
cases, imperative. In the discussion that follows, a basic division is made between positive and negative imperatives, and within both categories various
subtypes are distinguished.
Imperatives are normally directed at people, but they may be directed at
other entities as well. By using (20-3) the speaker is sicking a dog:20.2 Positive imperatives(20-3)843Tari-a!

in section 20.2.3.","[895, 896]"
"Negation and disabling conditionsNegation by means of the subject markers, whether in the simple or in the double negative construction, neutralizes the future-nonfuture tense distinction.
There is, however, another type of negative construction that asserts that a potential, contemplated, expected situation will not obtain, or should not obtain,
because of some disabling conditions. A state of affairs would obtain were it
not for some disabling conditions. The disabling conditions may but need not
be expressed. This type of negative construction is bi-clausal. The first clause is
the event one; it expresses the potential, contemplated, expected situation. The
event clause is grammatically positive. It must contain the irrealis marker sa
(section 18.2) and the subject marker must be sequential. The second clause is a
mini-clause that consists of the lexical negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the
case’ with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker qe. The basic
structure of this construction is shown schematically in (17-55):

there is, of course, no guarantee that they will. For example, telling lies is contrary to social norms:17.6 Negation and disabling conditions(17-59)Kaala wela

"The tenses15.1.1. Introduction
Toqabaqita has a basic tense opposition of future vs. nonfuture, expressed by
the respective sets of subject-tense markers (section 4.8). Within both categories further distinctions can be made by means of additional elements and constructions. There is also a kind of past-in-the-past, which is not uniquely associated with the nonfuture subject markers.
The tenses are relative: the reference time may be the time of the speech act
or the time of another situation. If the reference time is other than the time of
speech, it is usually, although not always, signalled in another clause. The future-tense subject markers are used when the situation time is after the time of
reference. The nonfuture-tense subject markers are used when the situation time
is before the time of reference both for states and for dynamic situations, and at
reference time for states. They are also used to express general states and gnomic situations. (They can also be used to express habitual states of affairs.) For
dynamic situations, when the situation time is at the time of reference, the event
is in progress.
Semantically, the future-nonfuture contrast is rather complex, and there is
no simple correlation between the tenses as grammatical categories and situation times. Both sets of subject markers are used not only to mark tense but also
with other functions. The nonfuture markers are used to encode not only past
and present situations, but occasionally also future situations, especially situations that are imminent, about to obtain. And they are also used in positive imperatives. The future markers are used to encode future situations, but they also
function, jointly with another particle, to encode counterfactual past situations.
Furthermore, the same set of subject-tense markers that signals future tense is
also used to express the imperfective aspect: habitual and general events, and
events in progress, including such events in the past. That is, imperfectivity678Tense and aspectoverrides tense. However, events in progress, and habitual and general situations are also commonly encoded by the nonfuture subject markers. There are
circumstances where only the future/imperfective markers can occur, and there
are circumstances where only the nonfuture markers can, but there are also
circumstances where members of either set can be used. This is especially true
of the imperfective domain. Furthermore, the sequential subject markers (chapter 16) too can be used with past-time or future-time reference.
The grammatical future-nonfuture contrast holds only in positive clauses.
With one type of exception that, grammatically, does not concern the tenses,
the contrast is suspended in negative clauses, where the same set of negative
subject markers is used regardless of the time of a state of affairs.","[730, 731]"

That is, the same negative construction can be used to express a disagreetype answer to an open question and as a negative answer to a polar question.
The only difference is that in responses to polar questions the negative verb has
the sense ‘not be so, not be the case’, while in responses to open questions the
negative verb has the negative existential sense ‘not exist’. (Negative existential
sentences are discussed 26.1.2.2.) The fact that in responses to open questions
the negative verb functions as an existential one can be seen from (19-175a),
where the verb occurs in the predicate position of a negative existential sentence with an overt subject phrase. In (19-175b) only the verb occurs with the
subject marker and the assertive marker:
(19-175)a.","[889, 890]"
"26.1 Locational and existential sentences919Negative existential sentences can express the fact that a certain type of
entity does not exist or is not available, normally at a certain location and at a
certain time, or that there is no entity of a certain type involved in a type of
state of affairs. Negative existential sentences also serve to express lack of possession, which is grammatically treated as non-existence or non-availability
with respect to a potential possessor. This is discussed in section 26.2.1.2.
Negative existential sentences employ the verb aqi ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’, also ‘not be so, not be the case’, which also serves to form negative constructions (sections 17.3 and 17.4). Negative existential sentences are unusual
in that the verb, with its subject marker, comes before the subject. This is one
of only two types of sentence where the verb precedes the subject (the other
being one type of interrogative locational sentences; see section 19.3.7) (and
also section 19.3.8). In negative existential sentences the subject marker must
be third person singular, nonfuture, future, or sequential (not negative or dehorative). In addition, the verb aqi may be accompanied by one or more particles that belong in the verb complex (chapter 5). The basic structure of negative
existential sentences is shown in (26-17):
(26-17)[3sg.subject.marker aqi]
[subject.NP ...]
not.exist/not.be.availableThe subject noun phrase is non-referential. It encodes the type of entity
whose non-existence or non-availability is being expressed. The subject noun
phrase contains an indefinite quantifier, either ta ‘some’ or, less commonly, tai
‘some.PL’ (section 6.8.6). Tai is used only with count nouns and has a plural
value. Ta is used both with count nouns and with mass nouns. With count
nouns ta is unspecified as to number (singular or plural). The location or the
time characterized by the non-existence/non-availability of a type of entity may
be expressed after the subject noun phrase, but frequently it is not expressed
when it is determinable from context.
In (26-18) – (26-22) the subject noun phrases contain ta.

over and over again, because there is no more ground [for new gardens].’ (That is, because of shortage of land, people use the same
pieces of land for gardens over and over again.)
PRFIn the next three examples, the subject noun phrases contain the plural quantifier tai. The subject marker with the verb aqi ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’
must be singular, even if the subject noun phrase designates humans, as in (2623):

LOCPRO‘This island, there are no people (living) there.’
Compare (26-23) further above with aququa naqi ‘this island’ in situ.
Negative existential sentences with topicalized “locations” are also used as a
type of negative possessive sentence, where the possessor is treated as if he or
she were a location. The possessor is an unlinked topic (section 38.5): no
prepositional phrase with the locative pro-form ei is used. There are no corresponding sentences with the expression of the possessor in a non-topic position.
In (26-26) the possessor is first person singular, and the subject marker is third
person singular. The first person singular pronoun is in the topic position, not in
the subject position.

26.2.1.2.
The subject noun phrase in a negative existential clause may contain a relative clause that characterizes the type of entity designated by the noun phrase.
However, relative clauses are used in this way only if the position relativized is
other than subject, as in (26-27):922Locational, existential, and possessive sentences(26-27)Qe

‘The man is egocentric. There is no girl that likes him./No girl likes
him.’
(The verb naunau ‘be egocentric’ is a reduplication of the first person singular
pronoun nau.)
Even though the relative clause has a negative subject marker, the modification is positive, not negative. That is, in (26-28) the meaning is not ‘There is no
girl that does not like him.’ (The Toqabaqita counterpart of ‘There is no girl
that does not like him’ would be ‘Every girl/All girls like(s) him’.)
As discussed in section 17.4, one of the negating strategies of Toqabaqita is
a double negative construction that employs a negative subject marker in the
event clause, and in addition there is a “mini-clause” that consists of the negative everb aqi with its own subject marker. Even though the event clause has a
negative subject marker, it does not negate the preceding negative mini-clause.
In a similar fashion, in the construction discussed here, even though the modifying clause is grammatically negative, it does not have a negative force.
This construction serves to express the non-existence, non-availability of a
certain type of participant in, or for, a certain type of situation.
The sentences in (26-29) and (26-30) also illustrate this construction:

If the subject of the relative clause is third person, the negative subject
marker in the relative clause must be singular, even if the subject of the negative existential clause is plural and even if it has human referents. In (26-31)
and (26-32) the subject phrases contain the plural quantifier tai; nevertheless,
the subject markers in the relative clauses are (and must be) singular.

In (26-33) below, there is a mismatch in grammatical person. The subject of
the negative clause is third person, but the negative subject marker in the relative clause is second person singular. The speaker addresses himself individually to each of the addressees.","[971, 972, 973, 974, 975, 976]"
"Grammatically negative existential possessive sentencesThere are several ways in which negative counterparts of grammatically positive existential possessive sentences can be formed. The basic one is a negative
existential sentence of the type discussed in section 26.1.2.2, with the negative
existential verb aqi ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ and its third person singular
subject marker, occurring before the subject. The subject consists of a possessive noun phrase of the type discussed in the preceding section. In (26-52) the
possessive noun phrase is in bold.",[982]
"29.4.4. Desiderative verbs
The following verbs are included here: thathami ‘want’, ‘like’, ‘wish’; lalakwa
‘not want’, ‘not like’; manata-toqo ‘think of doing st.’, ‘want, intend to do st.’;
laloma ‘intend to do st.’; and toqe ‘desire, intend to do st.’ ‘have one’s mind set
on doing st.’.
Thathami ‘want’, ‘like’, ‘wish’ is a Class 1 transitive verb and can take nonclausal direct objects:
(29-52)Qo
thathami-a
alo mada
taro or
2SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ
‘Do you want the taro or the yam?’kai?
yamThathami takes complement clauses and nominalizations as its direct objects. There is also a preverbal desiderative particle thathami (section 29.5).
Complementation using clauses is discussed first. This strategy can be used1002Complement clausesregardless of whether or not there is identity of subjects between the complement clause and the thathami clause. Grammatically positive complement
clauses must contain the appropriate future-tense or sequential subject marker,
the former being more common. Grammatically negative complement clauses
contain the appropriate negative subject marker. The first four examples show
constructions where the subjects in the complement clause and in the thathami
clause are different. In the first three the complement clauses are grammatically
positive.

‘Yes, and I want you two to pierce my ears ….’ (Lit.: ‘Yes, and I
want [it] you two will pierce my ears ….’)
The second person dual pronoun kamaroqa in (29-53) is the subject of the
complement clause, not the direct object of thathami ‘want’. This is evidenced
by the presence of the third person object marker -a on thathami. See also section 29.2.1 for discussion.

The next example shows the free variation between a future-tense and a
sequential subject marker in the complement clause, but the use of the futuretense subject marker is more common:

matrix clauses are identical.

In all the examples of complement clauses of thathami ‘want’ presented thus
far, the desired states of affairs are conceived of as ones that may occur, or are
likely to occur, or at least there is no reason to think they will not occur (although it may turn out that a desired state of affairs did not materialize after
all). To express the fact that a desired situation is not particularly strongly expected to take place or to express counterfactuality, that is, non-realization of a
desired state of affairs, the irrealis marker sa is used in the complement clause.

For another example see (29-56) further above.
However, this way of negating desiderative constructions with complement
clauses is not common. Instead, it is normally the main clause that is negative,
grammatically and/or semantically. While it is true that ‘want that X not be the
case’ and ‘not want that X be the case’ are not fully synonymous, the latter type
of expression is the norm in Toqabaqita, while the former type is dispreferred.
There are two ways in which negation of a want or wish can be expressed in the
main clause. One is by negating thathami ‘want’, and the other is by using the
verb lalakwa ‘not want’, ‘not like’ in a grammatically positive clause. Unlike
thathami, lalakwa is an intransitive verb. It can take non-clausal oblique objects
that express that which is not liked. The oblique object is governed by the general preposition qani.
(29-61)Nau ku
lalakwa qana
1SG 1SG.NFUT not.like GENP
‘I don’t like taumanga pudding.’taumanga.
k.o.puddingLalakwa takes paratactic complement clauses. This type of construction can
be used only when the subjects of the complement clause and the lalakwa
clause are different. Grammatically positive complement clauses require the
appropriate future-tense subject marker; in addition, there may a subject noun
phrase.
Although lalakwa is synonymous with negated thathami, the privileges of
occurrence of the two verbs are not identical. Thathami can take complement
clauses regardless of whether or not the main and the complement clause have
identical subjects. On the other hand, lalakwa can have a complement clause
only if the subjects are not identical. There is a preverbal undesiderative particle, also of the form lalakwa, used when the person, etc. not wanting a state of29.4 Complement-taking verbs1005affairs to come about is the same person, etc. as the one who would otherwise
bring it about or who may have to bring it about nevertheless; see section 29.5.
The sentences in (29-62) and (29-63) show the alternative constructions with
lalakwa and with negated thathami, respectively:

1SG 1SG.NFUT not.want 2SG.FUT be/feel.sad

‘I don't want my son (lit.: child) to speak with this girl.’
Compare (29-56) further above with thathami ‘want’ in the matrix clause
and a negated complement clause.
And in (29-66) the complement clause contains the irrealis marker sa (here
reduced to s=), which may signal a feeling on the part of the speaker that the1006Complement clausesundesirable situation may, in fact, take place; or it may signal counterfactuality:
the undesirable event did take place (section 18.3).

a. ‘I wish you wouldn’t go down to the sea.’
b. ‘I didn’t want you to go down to the sea (but you did).’The clausal complements both of thathami ‘want’ and of lalakwa ‘not want’
can be used when reference is made to specific situations or to generic, habitual
(types of) situations; see, for example, (29-53) further above for thathami and
(29-64) for lalakwa, respectively.
Both verbs can also take nominalizations as their complements: direct objects in the case of transitive thathami, and oblique objects introduced by the
general preposition qani in the case of intransitive lalakwa. This kind of complementation strategy is used to express general, habitual states of affairs rather
than ones that (would) obtain on a specific occasion.

Another desiderative verb is manata-toqo ‘think of doing st.’, ‘want, intend
to do st.’. Manata-toqo can also function as a propositional-attitude verb (section 29.4.8.) Manata-toqo is a Class 2 transitive verb. It consists of manata
‘think about sb, st.’, ‘think about doing st.’ and the TEST suffix -toqo (section
4.2.3.3.2.2). (Intransitive manata does not take complement clauses. The potential event is expressed in a purpose clause or a purpose nominalization; see [328] in section 32.2 for an example of the former.) Not infrequently, manata-toqo
is pronounced /mantatn!n/ or even /mantn!n/. Manata-toqo can take non-clausal
direct objects, in which case it has the meaning ‘think about sb., st.’:29.4 Complement-taking verbs(29-69)1007Nau ku

‘I am thinking about my child.’As a desiderative verb, manata-toqo takes direct-object complement clauses.
Its own subject and the subject of the complement clause must be coreferential
(but see further below for the use of manata-toqo in one kind of [verb verb]
compound), and the complement clause, if grammatically positive, must have
the appropriate future-tense subject marker.

Manata-toqo can be followed by the verb ngado ‘be still, settled, firm’ in a
[verb verb] compound. The compound has the meaning ‘hope, expect that such
and such will be the case’, ‘have one’s mind set on such and such’. The compound is an intransitive verb and takes paratactic clauses as its complements.
(Exceptionally, manata-toqo is not a transitive verb in the compound, the way
Class 2 transitive verbs normally are as the first members of [verb verb] compounds.) The complement clause, if grammatically positive, must have the appropriate future-tense marker. With the compound (unlike with manata-toqo
alone) the subjects of the two clauses may be the same or different. In (29-72)
they are identical:1008

‘I hope to have/open (lit.: make) a store one day.’ ‘I have my mind

If the subjects of the two clauses are different, the participant encoded as the
subject of the complement clause is also realized as an oblique object of the
compound, with the general preposition qani. In the complement clause it is
encoded only by means of a subject marker. In (29-73) the relevant participant
is the speaker’s child:

Manata-toqo can function not only as a desiderative verb but also as a propositional-attitude verb ‘think that, assume that’ (section 29.4.8).
To express an intention or a plan to do something, it is also possible to use
laloma-toqo ‘intend to do st.’. Laloma-toqo is a Class 2 transitive verb. It consists of laloma ‘think (about doing st.)’ and the TEST suffix -toqo. Laloma-toqo
takes a complement clause as its direct object. Grammatically positive complement clauses have the appropriate future-tense subject marker. The subjects of
the complement clause and the matrix clause must be identical.

consists of mada, the verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’, and the third person
singular nonfuture subject marker qe. The second clause is the event clause,
which is grammatically positive. The basic structure of the construction is
shown in (18-61):

Usually it is the whole proposition expressed in the event clause that the
speaker is less than fully certain about. However, it is possible to make it explicit that it is only part of the proposition that the uncertainty relates to. In (1866) the mada strategy is combined with the particle toqo, and the latter has only
the focused first person singular pronoun in its scope. The speaker is uncertain
not about the event of the people whispering but about who or what they are

These two forms are sentence pro-forms that signal a relatively high level of
uncertainty about the factual status of a proposition, or even complete lack of
knowledge with respect to a proposition. They occur clause-initially, unless
another element has been fronted, for example in topicalization. They can also
form utterances by themselves.
Botaena and botaqana are mutually interchangeable, the former being
somewhat more common. In one function, they are often used in uncertain replies to questions. If the reply is clausal with a verb, the verb takes the appropriate sequential subject marker.

such cliticization results in an additional syllable of the host being stressed in
order for sequences of more than two unstressed syllables next to each other
not to arise. In (2-71) the plural marker /k+/ has cliticized on the trisyllabic verb
/ba!+ta/. It is not only the first syllable of /ba!+ta/ that receives stress but the last
syllable as well:
(2-71)/bn6n ba!+ta

clause initial or because there is a pause between the grammatical element and
the preceding word, monosyllabic elements cliticize onto the following word.
However, even though they are word initial, they do not, with two types of exception, receive stress:

[6a7y:l7$apa:l7 !'$7pl nap!a]One type of exception concerns the combination of the third person singular
nonfuture subject marker /!'/ with the negative verb /a!+/. As mentioned in the
discussion of stress in section 2.3, here it is more common for the subject

The other type of exception concerns the general locative preposition /-!+/.
This preposition cliticizes to the following word when that word is grammatical, unless it fuses with the preceding element (see further below for fusion),
and it is the preposition that carries word-initial stress:
(2-76)/al'-a

[np7 !'p!+ tap$a !npta]Cliticization is not indicated when examples are presented in the orthography in the rest of the grammar; but see further below for the combination of the
third person singular subject marker /!'/ and the negative verb /a!+/.
Cliticization as discussed above must be distinguished from what is here
referred to as “fusion” of two or sometimes even three words. In fusion, the two
or three lexical and/or grammatical words form one phonological word, and the
non-final component or components that make up a fused word lose some of
their phonological material at their ends, a segment, a syllable or even two syllables. With one type of exception, the final component occurs in its full form.
The exception is grammatical elements that begin with a glottal stop: they lose
the glottal stop when fused to the preceding element. Words that have fused
together behave as single phonological words for the purposes of stress assignment.
Fusion is signalled in the grammar by means of an equal sign: =, including
when examples are presentend in the orthography.
Fusion may involve grammatical words or lexical words. In some cases,
fusion is obligatory. Obligatory fusion involves certain combinations of grammatical words: when two or three such words occur next to each other, fusion
must take place. The reduced forms in which morphemes that obligatorily undergo fusion occur are referred to in the grammar as the “combining” forms of
those morphemes. (A few morphemes must occur in their combining forms
when a bound morpheme is suffixed to them.)
Fusion is obligatory when certain postverbal particles occur next to each
other. A few examples are given in (2-79). (For further discussion and examples see section 5.2.)36Phonology(2-79)a.b./bn!n/ and

VENT/bn=na=ma+/
[bnynamp+]In other cases, fusion is optional and its frequence of occurrence varies. In
normal speech, the demonstrative /!er+/ ‘this’, ‘that’ and the plural marker /k+/
always fuse as /!'=k+/ ‘those’, ‘these’, although the unfused sequence /!er+/ /k+/
is accepted by speakers of the language as grammatical. The sequence of /k7la/
‘place’ and /na!+/ ‘this’ is normally realized as /k7=na!+/, rather than without
fusion.
The general preposition /!ana/ more often than not fuses with consonantinitial monosyllabic grammatical morphemes. It either has the form /!a=/, or
/!an=/. /!a=/ occurs regardless of the nature of the following consonant, while
/!an=/ occurs only before dental consonants:

"731Sequential clauses of negationThe use of the sequential subject markers in clauses of negation represents yet
another kind of departure from the central function. “Clauses of negation” is a
cover term for clauses that are grammatically negative and for clauses that contain the semantically negative verb aqi ‘not be so, not be the case’. (Aqi also
functions as part of a negative construction. For more detail on negation see
chapter 17.) And a “sequential clause of negation” is a clause of negation that
contain a sequential subject marker. The subject marker in a sequential clause
of negation must be the third person singular marker ka. Here the sequential
subject marker does not signal sequentiality of the onsets of situations. Rather,
sequential clauses of negation express unfulfilled expectation: an expected,
projected, attempted, desired situation did not materialize. The situation that
was expected, projected, attempted, or desired is expressed or implied in preceding discourse. Obviously, this is not sequentiality of the onsets of situations
in a strict sense, because the relevant situation did not obtain, although one
might argue that there is sequentiality in the sense that the expectation, etc. of a
situation was followed by the situation’s non-occurrence.
Usually, a sequential clause of negation is joined to the preceding clause by
the conjunction ma ‘and’, although this is not required. For an example without
the conjunction see (16-31) further below. Sometimes, a clause that precedes a
sequential clause of negation does explicitly express the expected, projected,
attempted, or desired situation. In such cases the clause of negation may, but
need not, be in construction with a subsequent clause that expresses the nonoccurring situation. The latter is, in fact, more common; see (16-27), and (1628) and (16-29), respectively.

More commonly, the situation is not encoded in a sequential clause of negation. In such cases, aqi functions as a fully-fledged verb ‘not be so, not be the
case’:

Commonly, it is only a sequential clause of negation that explicitly expresses the expected/projected/attempted/desired situation that did not obtain,
that situation being only implied in preceding discourse.

‘They spoke to him [telling him not to do such and such and expecting him to obey], but he did not obey.’
Sometimes, the non-occurrence of the relevant situation does temporally
follow the situations expressed in the preceding clauses; for example, wanting a
person to swear but that person not swearing ([16-27] further above), planting
something but it not growing ([16-30] above). But it is also possible for the
situation expressed in a sequential clause of negation not to have been realized
at, or by, the time of the situation(s) expressed in the preceding clause(s). Nevertheless, there is still an unfulfilled prior expectation. In (16-32) the hoped-for
situation had not materialized by the time of the situation expressed in the preceding clause. The perfect marker in the sequential clause signals that that
event was no longer expected to take place (section 15.3).

‘It is sunny now.’ ‘It has become sunny.’The negative verbToqabaqita has a negative verb aqi, whose senses are ‘not be so, not be the
case’, ‘not exist’, and ‘not be available’. Aqi is a negative verb in two senses:
because of its meanings as a lexical verb, and because it also has a grammatical
function in the double negative construction, discussed in detail in section 17.4.
When it functions as a lexical verb, it is glossed according to its meaning: ‘not
be so’, ‘not be the case’, ‘not exist’, or ‘not be available’. When it is employed
in the grammatical function, it is glossed NEGV. In this section the focus is on
aqi as a lexical verb. Aqi has all the characteristics of verbs, with two exceptions: it is used only with third person singular subject markers, and, apart from
negative existential sentences (section 26.1.2.2), it does not take subject noun
phrases. A few examples of aqi as a lexical verb are given below.
In (17-17) it occurs with two postverbal particles:

There are several ways in which negative purpose ([do something] in order that
a certain state of affairs may not obtain) is signalled. The most common one by
far uses the timitive marker ada in its preventive precautionary function. This
function is discussed in more detail and exemplified in section 18.6.3, and here
only a brief summary is given. When ada is used, the negative-purpose clause
is grammatically positive, and the subject marker is always sequential. The
(notional) subject of the first clause and the subject of the purpose clause may
be identical or different.

‘I’ll go and see the man so that he doesn’t get angry with me.’ ‘I’ll

The timitive construction is used when the speaker and possibly somebody
else is/are are apprehensive about a possible state of affairs and so a preventive
action is taken to (try to) avoid it. When there is no apprehension about a possible state of affairs, the timitive marker is not used. Instead, the purpose subordinator fasi is used, which also functions to express positive purpose. The other
positive-purpose subordinator, uri, is not, by itself, used in this function; but
see further below. Negative-purpose clauses introduced by fasi are grammatically negative. When the negative verb aqi is present in the purpose clause, its
subject marker is non-future.
In the situation expressed in (33-73) the speaker wants to prevent a state of
affairs from obtaining, not because he fears it, but because he wants to play a
trick on others:33.3 Purpose clauses and nominalizations(33-73)Nau kwai

"Tona, tofa, etc. restrictiveThere are a number of particles that signal that a situation is restricted only to
the event or state expressed in the clause, when some additional or different
states of affairs, performed by the same participant, are normally expected or
required. The particles are tona, toneqe, tootona, tootoneqe, tofa, tofe, tofeqe,
tootofa, tootofeqe. The reduplicated forms are used only in negative imperatives (although the other forms are possible there as well). Elsewhere, only tona
and tofa are used commonly, tona being more common than tofa. As mentioned
in section 20.3.1, in negative imperatives the verb is often reduplicated to express the meaning ‘stop doing such and such’. The use of the reduplicated restricted-situation markers in negative imperatives suggests that all of these particles developed from erstwhile verbs. In addition to one of these preverbal
particles, the postverbal limiter ba- is often present as well.
Tona and its variant toneqe also occur in noun phrases.

"20.4.2. Immediate imperatives
Immediate imperatives are imperatives used when the speaker expects the state
of affairs to be brought about immediately, or to be discontinued immediately.
Immediate imperatives employ the perfect marker naqa (section 15.3), which is
also used to express immediate future (section 15.1.2.2). The perfect marker is
used both in positive and in negative imperatives. In positive imperatives it is
used regardless of the type of the subject marker present, and also when there is
no subject marker.

"Boqo assertive, intensifierIn declarative clauses/sentences, boqo serves to strongly assert, emphasize that
the state of affairs is indeed so or such and such. In its assertive function, boqo
is particularly frequent in negative clauses. Boqo is also used in non-declarative
clauses/sentences, where its function is better seen as intensifying. Most commonly, boqo has the predicate in its scope, but its scope may extend over the
whole clause.
Boqo has a combining form bo=, used in combination with the perfect
marker/intensifier naqa and with the directionals.

"If a clause in the timitive mood is negative, the simple or the double negating constructions can be used (sections 17.2 and 17.4, respectively), except that
in the double negative construction the negative verb aqi must have the third
person singular sequential subject marker ka, not the nonfuture subject marker.
The basic structures of the negative timitive constructions are shown in (1873a) and (18-73b). In the former, the negative construction is of the simple
type; and in the latter it is of the double type. In (18-73b) the optional noun

degree of likelihood of the situation obtaining.","[833, 834]"
"Mada ‘or’Less-than-full certainty on the part of the speaker about the factual status of a
proposition can be signalled by means of the form mada ‘or’, which also functions as a disjunctive coordinator for phrases and sentences (sections 11.2.2 and
28.4, respectively), and together with the irrealis marker sa introduces the protases of conditional sentences (section 31.1). When it marks epistemic possibility, mada does not necessarily conjoin clauses or sentences. In this function,
mada can occur in a grammatically positive or a grammatically negative construction, the latter being more common. The constructions with ‘or’ signal a
relatively low degree of certainty on the part of the speaker about the factual
status of the proposition. They function as suggestions concerning what a given
state of affairs might be.
In a grammatically positive construction, mada occurs initially in the event
clause, unless a constituent has been topicalized (see [18-60b] further below):
(18-59)Mada kera

or
3PL.NFUT arrive
‘They may have arrived already.’Grammatically positive sentences with mada ‘or’ are sometimes given the
intonation of polar interrogatives, with a rise in the intonation at the end of the
sentence (section 19.2.1), which expresses a relatively high degree of uncertainty. This is the case in (18-60a) and (18-60b). In (18-60b) the subject noun
phrase has been topicalized.

"Pseudo-verbsThe head of a verb phrase is a verb. However, in Toqabaqita there is a mechanism to treat phrasal units, specifically noun phrases, as if they were verbs: a
syntactic unit, a noun phrase, is “re-ranked” to function as if it were a lexical
unit, a verb. Such “pseudo-verbs” take the appropriate subject markers in the
same way that verbs do.
There is one type of pseudo-verb that is particularly common. It consists of
the noun quna ‘manner, way’ usually followed by the demonstrative qeri ‘this’,
also ‘that (mentioned before)’, or, rarely, by another demonstrative. Quna qeri
‘(in) this manner; thus’ is the commonest way to introduce direct speech, considerably more common than a verb of speaking, such as detransitivized soreqe or transitive sore-a (with the object suffix -a) ‘say’ (section 37.4). Here only138The verb phrasethe demonstrative qeri is possible. In (4-224) there are four instances of direct
speech. The first one is introduced by means of soe-toqo ‘ask’, the last one by
means of sore-qe ‘say’, and the two in between by means of quna qeri. The two
clauses with quna qeri are in bold. The subject markers used with quna qeri are
third person sequential.

(lit.:thus-ed), “I am following my mother and father.”. The man said,
“Where did your mother and father go?”. The child said, “My
mother and father went to the market.”.’
Noun phrases headed by quna can also be used as a pseudo-verb with the
meanings ‘be like this/that’, ‘behave, act in this/that manner’, ‘do something in
this/that way’. In (225) quna qeri occurs in a negative imperative. Here the
subject marker is second person singular negative.

is doing something. It is not a comment on his speaking.
In (4-226) the phrase headed by quna contains the addressee-sphere demonstrative qena:

‘I pray for you a lot, because your life is like that [as mentioned

Besides their occurrence with subject markers, the verb-like nature of quna
phrases can be seen from the following facts. First, they can occur with oblique
objects:
(4-227)... kera keka
quna
qeri uri nau, “Qoo,

“Oh, you have won over us, ….”.’)
And second, just like verbs, quna phrases can be reduplicated to express the
continuative/iterative aspect (section 15.2.3). It is quna that undergoes the reduplication. In (4-228) there are three instances of the pseudo-verb quna qeri,
the first one of which contains reduplicated quna:

this [the speaker jerking his head in a different way] but it held fast
here, and he did like this [the speaker jerking his head in a different
way again] but it held fast here.’
Quna phrases can cooccur with a verb. In some cases they act as pseudoverbs and form [verb (pseudo-)verb] compounds with the preceding verb. Such
compounds are verbs. The compound status of such forms is evidenced by the
fact that postverbal particles cannot intervene between the verb and the quna
phrase and can only follow the [verb (pseudo-)verb] unit. In (4-229) the compound is followed by the additive and the intensifier postverbal particles:
(4-229)Raa quna

‘Work like that again [the way you worked before].’And in (4-230) the compound is followed by the limiter ba-. The limiter

GENP CLFCombinations of a verb and a quna phrase of the type just discussed are
[verb (pseudo-)verb] compounds, not [verb noun] compounds with an incorpo-4.7 Pseudo-verbs141rated object. Only nouns without modifiers, not noun phrases, can be incorporated in the latter type of compound (section 12.4.1).
Quna phrases can also function as verb-phrase level constituents, as modifiers of verbs in verb phrases, in which case they are (true) noun phrases, not
pseudo-verbs. See (4-1) in section 4.1 for their position in verb phrases. Their
status as phrase-level noun phrases rather than as pseudo-verbs is evidenced by
the fact that they can be separated from the preceding verb by intervening material, which is not possible in [verb verb] compounds. In (4-231) the limiter particle intervenes:

INTSNoun phrases headed by quna ‘manner, way’ are the only type of noun
phrase other than those in the direct-object position that can function as verbphrase constituents. And they are also the only kind of noun phrase that can
function as a noun modifier; see section 6.14.
Greetings and leave-taking formulae can be used as delocutive pseudoverbs. In (4-233) the leaving-taking formula ‘good night’ is used on its own, not
as a pseudo-verb:
(4-233)Rodo leqa.
night be.good
‘Good night.’ (See section 27.3.2 for an extended use of this expression.)142The verb phraseIn (4-234), on the other hand, rodo leqa has been re-ranked. It occurs in a
parting formula with the second person singular sequential subject marker and
is followed by the andative directional:
(4-234) Qoko

2SG.SEQ night be.good AND
‘Good night to you.’ (Lit.: ‘You be good-night off.’) (Said by the person leaving.)

(4-235)Qoko
too-too

AND
2SG.SEQ RDP-stay
(I am going). ‘Good bye.’ (Lit.: ‘You stay off.’) (Said by the person
leaving.)Other kinds of re-ranking into pseudo-verbs do occur, but they appear to be
more on-the-spot creations. For example, in (4-236) re-ranking has taken place
in the negative counterpart of a verbless ascriptive sentence (section 27.2.5).
The re-ranked phrase is teqe si lio ‘one mind’. The pseudo-verb has the plural
inclusive negative subject marker and is followed by the postverbal anteriorcontinuing particle quu:

Compare the ascriptive sentence in (4-237), where re-ranking has not taken
place: there is no negative subject marker with the noun phrase toqa qi Toqabaqita ‘people at Toqabaqita’. That noun phrase functions as the subject of the
negative verb aqi ‘not be the case’, but it has been extraposed to the right. (See
section 27.2.5 for discussion of negative counterparts of grammatically positive
verbless sentences.)

"The concessive constructionsTo form concessive clauses, the postverbal particle mena is used. For the position of mena in the verbal complex see table 5.2 in section 5.2.1. Mena also
functions as a clause-level foregrounding-additive particle, which sometimes
expresses unexpectedness (section 28.6), and it also forms part of the clausal
coordinator sui mena ‘but’, which expresses the relations of contrast, unexpectedness between propositions (section 28.3). The notions of contrast and, especially, unexpectedness also apply to concessive relations between propositions
(section 32.2).
In addition to postverbal mena, another element, dooqanitaa or, rarely, boro,
may occur clause initially. Dooqanitaa also functions as an intransitive verb

related to it is not clear.

Grammatically positive verbal concessive clauses have a sequential or a
non-future subject marker, unless a future/imperfective subject marker is called
for. When dooqanitaa or boro is present, it is the sequential, rather than the32.2 Semantics of the concessive constructions1129non-future subject markers that are used. In grammatically negative concessive
clauses it is the double negative construction that is used (section 17.4), and it
is the negative verb aqi that has the (third person singular) sequential subject
marker if it is used. For a negative concessive clause see (32-5) above. A concessive clause may be verbless; see (32-12) in section 32.2.
Concessive clauses precede their main clauses, and typically there is a rise
in intonation at the end of a concessive clause, and there may also be a slight
pause between the concessive clause and the main clause.","[1180, 1181, 1182]"
"Affect topicsTo express the fact that the speaker has some kind of personal attitude towards
the referent of a topic phrase, there is a special “affect” topic marker, whose
form is molo. Molo follows the topic phrase, to which it can be linked by means
of the ligature ni.
Molo can be used to express the speaker’s view of the referent of the topic
phrase as in some way unusual, remarkable, in a positive or negative way,
whether in general or at a given time. It may signal surprise, admiration, regret,
wistfulness, anger, indignation on the part of the speaker with respect to the
referent of the topic phrase, which may be the speaker himself/herself. Sometimes there is a contrastive flavour to affect topics: the referent is remarkable in
contrast to something or someone else. Affect topic phrases tend to be relatively short and not prosodically separated from the comment domain.",[1318]
"26.2.1. Existential possessive sentences
In the case of existential possessive sentences, a distinction needs to be made
between positive and negative sentences.
26.2.1.1. Grammatically positive existential possessive sentences
As discussed in section 5.2.10, Toqabaqita has a self-benefactive/recipientbenefactive marker qa-, which occurs postverbally inside the verb complex:926Locational, existential, and possessive sentences(26-38)Keki
siisiu qa-da.
bathe SBEN-3PL.PERS
3PL.IPFV
‘They are bathing.’In some cases, the referent of the subject benefits from his/her own action
by becoming the possessor of something, such as when he or she makes something for himself/herself:

‘I am weaving myself a fan (lit.: my fan).’
The same particle can also be used to encode recipients in a recipientbenefactive construction (section 5.2.10.3). Recipients are, of course, new possessors.

some PRTT porkWhat is historically the same element is also used to express possession pure
and simple, without there necessarily being any suggestion of a self-benefactive
action or of the possessor having been a recipient. It is, of course, possible for a
possessor to be a beneficiary or a recipient, but the important point is that this
is not encoded in the clause in which the possessor is referred to. The structure
involved is a kind of verbless, and subjectless, existential sentence that consists
of a predicate noun phrase:
(26-41)[[qa-PERS NP]NP]Sent
POSSThe personal suffix on the possessive marker qa- encodes the possessor, and
the inner noun phrase the possessum. No possessor noun phrase can be present
inside the construction, although there can be an expression of the possessor
outside, in the topic position (see [26-44] further below). (The possessive
marker also forms part of one of the self-containedness constructions; see [234] in section 23.1.) As is shown further below, the possessive marker with a
personal suffix may be omitted under certain circumstances. Evidence that the26.2 Possessive sentences927structure in (26-41) is a noun phrase is presented further below, after several
examples of the construction have been given.

and one father
‘(He is) my (true) brother. We have one mother and one father.’
In addition to a personal suffix on the possessive marker, the possessor can
also be encoded by means of a topic noun phrase. In the exchange in (26-44),
speaker A uses only a personal suffix on the possessive marker to encode the
possessor, while speaker B uses both a personal suffix and a topic noun phrase:
(26-44)A: Qa-muqa

ulu botho.
1SG POSS-1SG.PERS three pig
A: ‘How many pigs do you have?’
B: ‘I, I have three pigs.’
When the possessor is expressed by means of a topic noun phrase, it is possible for the possessive marker to be omitted, the possessive relation being only
implied. Thus, instead of (26-42) further above, with the possessive marker,
one can say (26-45), without it:
(26-45)Nau roo wela.
1SG two child
‘I have two children.’ (Lit.: ‘I, [there are] two children.’)And it is possible to omit the noun phrase expressing the possessum, if the
context makes it clear what that entity is:928Locational, existential, and possessive sentences(26-46)Qa-kuqa.
POSS-1SG.PERS
‘(It’s) mine.’ (Speaking about food.)Evidence that the possessive structure [qa-PERS NP] forms a noun phrase
comes from the fact that it can occur in noun-phrase positions in larger sentences. In (26-47) it occurs in the subject position:
(26-47)[Qa-na
teqe qaba] qe
qoo.
POSS-3SG.PERS one arm
3SG.NFUT be.broken
‘One of his arms is broken.’ (Lit.: ‘Of his one arm is broken.’)Such possessive phrases can also function as the subjects of grammatically
negative existential possessive sentences; see section 26.2.1.2.
In (26-48) below, the possessive phrase occurs as the complement of the
verb-like purpose preposition uri. The preposition carries the object-indexing
suffix -a, which means that its complement must be a lexical noun phrase (section 10.3.1).

(Lit.: ‘There is persistence in my chest for there to be of mine a corrugated-iron roof house.’)
PURP-3.OBJ POSS-1SG.PERS=someAnd in (26-49) the construction occurs after the conjunction bia ‘and’. Since
the form of the conjunction is bia, the coordinand to its right must be a lexical
noun phrase (section 11.2.1.2). The noun phrase encoding the possessum consists of two noun phrases in apposition.

‘This story is (lit.: goes) about a man and his wife and a child of
theirs, a boy.’
When the possessive structure occurs inside a larger sentence, and only
then, the order of the possessive marker and the possessum noun phrase can be
reversed, with the possessive marker following the possessum noun phrase.
However, this is possible only if the overall possessive noun phrase expresses a
subset. The sentences in (26-50a) and (26-50b) below illustrate the alternative
orderings of the possessive marker and the possessum noun phrase. The subject
markers are singular, even though the subject phrases refer to two people. That
is, the two children are treated grammatically as forming a (sub)set rather than
being individuated (section 4.9). This could be the case, for example, if the
children died at (more or less) the same time.

"The semantics of conditional sentencesOn the basis of their semantic and formal properties, two types of conditional
sentences are distinguished in Toqabaqita: reality conditionals and unreality
conditionals. The terms “reality conditionals” and “unreality conditionals” have
been adopted from Thompson and Longacre (1985), but they do not have exactly the same meanings here. Under reality conditions Thompson and Longacker include habitual/generic conditionals. In Toqabaqita such conditionals
are expressed in the same way that unreality conditionals are; see (31-37) further below. On formal grounds, the distinction between reality and unreality
conditionals is manifested in the apodosis through different sets of subject
markers, but only in grammatically positive apodoses, because all the
tense/aspect/sequentiality contrasts are neutralized under negation.
For Toqabaqita, the term “reality conditionals” only refers to those conditional sentences where both the protasis and the apodosis encode states of affairs that are real at the relevant time, in particular the one encoded in the apodosis. The apodosis expresses a state of affairs that obtains under the
circumstances expressed in the protasis at reference time. In reality conditional
sentences, the apodosis has a non-future or a negative subject marker. The sentence in (31-31) describes a situation after a man has made a war-club. He has
been experimenting with creating a new kind of war club, and having made this
one, he does not like its appearance. The apodosis has the third person singular
non-future subject marker e, fused with the nominalization of the verb ‘look at’:

‘He stood it [the club] up, looked, and kept looking at it; oh, this
stick, if he puts a “nose” (lit.: a nose thing) (on it) like this, it [the

also a kind of carved projection on one kind of war-club.)
In the events expressed in (31-31) the circumstances are such that the war-club
has been made in a certain way, and as a result it does not look good.
However, what is grammatically a conditional sentence need not express one
state of affairs following on from another one. The sentence in (31-32) below is
a comment about a kind of people who do exist. The (verbless, subjectless)
protasis does not express a condition, which, if fulfilled, results in the state of
affairs expressed in the (negative) apodosis. Rather, the protasis identifies the
circumstances under which the state of affairs expressed in the apodosis obtains.

Reality conditional sentences are not common in Toqabaqita, and the rest of
the discussion deals with unreality conditionals.
There are two subtypes of unreality conditionals in Toqabaqita, formally
distinguished by the types of subject markers in positive apodoses, sequential
or future. It is also possible for apodoses to contain a nonfuture subject marker,
but this is neither obligatory nor common. The use of the sequential and the
future subject markers is considered first. A sequential subject marker is used
when the state of affairs expressed in the apodosis would be/would have been a
direct and, especially, relatively immediate consequence of the state of affairs
of the protasis and when the speaker wishes to make this explicit. The state of
affairs of the protasis is a cause that results in the state of affairs of the apodosis. A future subject marker is used in all other cases: (i) when the state of
affairs of the apodosis would follow/would have followed that of the protasis,
but not as a direct, more-or-less immediate consequence of the latter; and (ii)
even if the state of affairs of the apodosis would be/would have been a direct,
relatively immediate consequence of the state of affairs of the protasis, the
speaker chooses not to present it as such.","[1170, 1171]"
