The pattern of negation through verbal inflection with ta- NEG or
the negative copula forms is the only means of negation in Yimas. All
negation in Yimas is sentential, having the entire clause within the scope
of the negative (but see Section 6.3. 1). There is no phrasal or word
level negative in Yimas, as there is in English with the prefix un- (see
Klima 1964, Payne 1985) . Only verbs can be inflected with the negative
morpheme; there are no negative forms for the true adjectives, such as
kpa- 'big'.
A final point about negation. As should be clear by now from the
long and detailed exposition I have felt bound to provide, negation in
Yimas is a quite complex affair, and one should not be surprised to
learn that this system is now gradually being abandoned. All speakers,
sometimes, and younger speakers (under 30) , commonly, avoid these
complexities by simply using the proclitic ina 'not' before a positive
verb. This proclitic ina is a borrowing from the Tok Pisin negative i no.
ina NEG is most usually encountered in equational sentences, where it
is now the norm for almost all speakers, but any verb can potentially be
negated by the innovation ina NEG instead of the traditional ta- NEG.
The only exception is negated possessive clauses with kayak 'don't have' ;
ina can never replace kayak.
5.2.2.2 Potential Modality
This modal prefix expresses events which are viewed as possible occur­
rences in the normal course of events, but not likely. Perhaps its most
common use is with tense suffixes expressing past tense to indicate events
which almost happened in the past, but did not in fact eventuate. The264BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYpotential modal prefix has the form ant-, but this contracts with third
person prefixes as follows: ant- POT + n- 3SG > anan-, ant- POT +
mpi- 3DL > ampi- , and ant- POT + mpu- 3PL > ampu. The poten­
tial modal prefix triggers the same rules for changes in the pronominal
prefixes as does ta- NEG, as seen in the following:
(5-127) a. ant-ka-tu-r-um
POT-1SG A-kill-PERF-PL
'I almost killed them. '
b. ant-JJa-tpul-c-um
POT-1SG 0-hit-PERF-PL
'They almost hit me.'
except that the general third person prefix pu- of negative verbs is not
used for verbs with ant-.
(5-128) anan-mal
POT 3SG S-die
'He almost died.'
The potential modality indicates events which are viewed by the
speaker as possible events. With future tense or non-perfective aspects,
the meaning is vague as to whether the reading should be the deontic
one ('is permitted/is able to') or the epistemic one ('is possible that'),
much like English can.

With past tense suffixes, and especially with the perfective aspect suffix
-r, ant- POT is used to indicate events which almost, but did not in
fact, happen.

b. ant-ka-tu-na-nak
POT-1SG A-kill-NR PAST-SG
'I almost killed him yesterday.'
Because of this meaning of potential past events which did not occur,
the potential modal prefix is employed in the formation of counterfactual
adverbial clauses (see Section 7.2.3), in both the apodosis and protasis.

The potential modal prefix is properly used in both the apodosis and
protasis, for both encode potential past events which did not occur.
5.2.2.3 Likely Modality
The likely modal prefix ka- encodes events which are regarded by the
speaker as likely to occur in the normal course of events. The likely
modal prefix does not normally trigger the same changes in the pronom-266BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYinal prefixes as do ta- NEG or ant- POT (although is a rarely observed
option) . It is simply added to an otherwise normally inflected verb.

ka- LIKE expresses events which are likely to occur, but not regarded
as definite by the speaker. Because of this, ka- cannot co-occur in the
near future with na- DEF, which implies a much stronger expectation
of occurrence. Both may be used with -kia NR FUT but with a subtle
difference in meaning.

Because of its meaning of unrealized, but likely events, ka- LIKE
never occurs with past tense suffixes or -r PERF (which are favored
by ant- POT). It is most common with the present and future tenses,
especially the former. With the future tenses it tends to weaken their
force, indicating likely events, but not definite ones (see 5-134a,b). With
the present tense it expresses an action close at hand that the speaker
thinks will probably come to pass (see also examples 5-133a,c).

plural, is realized as ra- when following another prefix. As ka- LIKE
is the only prefix which can precede it, this is the only environment in
what ra- will appear.
Finally, ka- LIKE is completely prohibited from co-occurring with
the irrealis. This is explicable in view of the semantic incompatibility of
the two: the irrealis expresses events the occurrence of which the speaker
expresses no commitment about.
Events which may occur are marked by the modal prefix ant- POT,
while those which should occur are marked by ka- LIKE. This difference
in Yimas is probably best brought out by the following sets of contrastive
examples:
(5-136) a. m-n

tomorrow.'
In the first example, the act of helping is a potential response to the
man's good character, but there is no commitment to this, so ant­
POT is proper in the second clause here. However, the act of one
man helping another sets up a reciprocal obligation which within Yi­
mas social customs would be extremely difficult to ignore. Therefore,
the act of helping in the second clause in (5-136b) is a highly likely
��vent, given the conditions of the first clause, so that ka- LIKE is proper
here.

NEG-2PL A-tell-PERF-PC-3PL D-talk
'You few didn't tell them.'
A negative verb with the paucal suffix may be potentially ambiguous
as it may not be clear which participant is modified by it. The basic
rule is that the paucal suffix is always interpreted as modifying a first or
second person participant, rather than a third person. Thus in (5-1 19e,
f, g) , - vkan indicates the paucal number of the first and second person
A prefix, and not the third person D prefix; these are not ambiguous.
In other cases, ambiguity is avoided by removing a pronominal affix for
one of the participants.

ta-kul-cpul-c-IJkt
c. kra-n
PC-FR DIST NEG-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PC
'Those few didn't hit you few.'
The negative of (5-120a) is (5-120b) , in which the paucal A participant
is prohibited from appearing on the verb as a pronominal affix and must
occur as an independent pronoun. The number suffix then references the
plural number of the second plural 0. If the paucal prefix is present, as
in (5-120c), it is interpreted as applying to the bound pronominal prefix
of the 0. This principle applies even when no ambiguity is possible.

The proper negative of (5-121), with a third paucal A and a second
dual 0, is (5- 121b), in which the number suffix is -rm DL, indicating
the number of the 0 (also coded in the pronominal prefix vkul- 2 DL
0). The presence of the paucal suffix -vkt as in (5-121c) results in
ungrammaticality, in spite of the fact that such a construction could
only unambiguously express a paucal A. The paucal suffix in negative262BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYverbs is in fact never allowed to reference the number of a third person
A; it is restricted to marking a third person paucal 0.

c. ta-J]kl-cpul-c-um
NEG-3PC A-hit-PERF-PL
'Those few didn't hit them. '
In (5-122a,b) , the suffix -vkt P C marks an 0 participant which is third
paucal. Note that (5-122a) with ka- 1SG A is grammatical, while (5121c) with vkul- 2DL 0 is not. This is because the paucal suffix is
restricted in third person to 0 participants only. Also, note that when
the third person paucal participant is an A, as in (5-122c), it is coded
by the corresponding pronominal prefix vkl- 3PC A, and the number of
the object is indicated by the negative number suffix.
The rules I have sketched above for negation apply to all verbs in
the language save one, the copula. While the copula in the positive
paradigm is inflected for person, number and noun class class, this does
not apply in the negative. There are two forms of the copula in the
negative: one used in equational statements and the other in possessive
constructions.
The form of the copula in negative equational statements is tampan.
This replaces all inflected forms of the copula presented in Section 5.1.5.
Consider the following pairs:

5.2.3.3 Negative Imperatives and Hortatives
Given the morphological complexity which we have seen associated with
both negatives and imperatives, we might approach the category of neg­
ative imperatives with some trepidation. But here, in fact, the language
surprises us, for negative imperatives are quite simply formed. There
are two ways to do so: one, traditional, associated mostly with older
speakers above 40, and a second, innovative, used by younger speakers.
The latter is the simpler and is formed by simply placing pack 'don't! '
following a verb inflected with the irrealis suffix. The verb has the same
form as a desiderative (see Section 5.2.1.1) and prohibits any pronominal
affixes.

The older, traditional way o f forming negative imperatives shows
greater similarity to negative constructions than imperatives. The main
difference between an ordinary negative verb and a negative imperative
is the presence of apu- NEG IMP in the place of ta- NEG. The im­
perative addressee number prefixes are not used, but rather the normal
pronominal prefix€s for second person A/S participants, as in negative
verbs. The only exception is second singular in which the prefix is 0
like singular imperatives generally. The imperative suffix -n ""' -na is276BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYnot used with negative imperatives, but is replaced by -nt PRES. Third
person 0 and D participants are referenced by the same suffixes found
in negative verbs and positive imperatives.

"BOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD83Example (b) corresponds to (a) as negative to positive. Note that the
pronominal prefix p- in (a) appears as the corresponding suffix - m in
the negative example (b), as a result of its position being usurped by
the initial negative prefix ta-. Thus, we define the string flanked on
both sides by these affixes as a word, using the behavior of negation as
a grammatical criterion for determining words.
Unfortunately, this grammatical criterion is often at odds with pho­
nological ones. Consider this example with an incorporated nominal (S
marks the subject of an intransitive verb):
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n
(2-23) mamam
sore VII SG VII SG S-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The sore is getting smaller.'
waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG is a derived nominal incorporated into the
verb and forming a grammatical unit with it (see Section 6.2.3. 1.3). This
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that when rule (2-23) is negated, the
usurped pronominal prefix p- becomes the suffix -m at the end of the
word, following the tense suffix -nt PRES.
(2-24) a. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-ti-nt-m
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES-VII SG S
'The sore isn't getting smaller.'
*
b. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-m-ti-n
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-VII SG S-become-PRES
Other pieces of evidence that this is a single grammatical word are
the behavior of valence-increasing prefixes. For example, if a causative
is derived from (2-23), the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- can precede the
incorporated nominal.
mamam
(2-25) marasin
medicine V SG sore VII SG
p-n-na-tar-waca-k-m-ti-n
VII SG 0-3SG A-DEF-CAUS-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The medicine made the sore smaller.'
The whole sequence waca-k-m-ti- small-IRR-VII SG-become 'become
small' is causativized by tar- CAUS, again demonstrating that it func­
tions as a grammatical unit.
While the verbs in (2-23) and (2-24) are single words by grammatical
criteria, they are not so on phonological grounds. Consider the incor-84PHONOLOGYporated nominal waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG again. Note that the class
and number concord marker appears as the word final allomorph - m
and not the word medial (and underlying) form -mp. This indicates a
word boundary between - m and the verb ti- 'become'. Stress patterns
also indicate two words, as the stress pattern for the verb in (2-23) is
p-na-waca-k-m-U-n, with both waca-k-n and ti- being assigned stress
independently (remember as discussed above, the pronominal prefixes
are unstressed and ignored by the stress rules when assigning stress) .
So on phonological criteria, the word would be represented as I# p­
na-waca-k-m # ti-n #I, while on grammatical criteria it would be I#
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n #I. Clearly, this is contradictory, and in order to
solve this dilemma, it is necessary to appeal to two different notions of
word, a phonological word and a grammatical word. With the earlier
discussion of nouns and adjectives, this was not necessary, as the two
criteria types coincided (although in treating noun compounds a similar
distinction would need to be invoked in English as well as Yimas; see
Di Sciullo and Williams 1987) . But with verbs, this distinction is clearly
needed. Phonological words are those word units defined by phonological
criteria, while grammatical words are those determined by grammatical
criteria. Units defined as words in Yimas by the segmental phonological
rules and stress rules are phonological words; I will henceforth use the
word boundary symbol to indicate the boundaries of phonological words.
Sequences which behave as integrated units with respect to grammatical
processes like valence changing and negative (among others) are gram­
matical words. The boundaries of grammatical words have no special
symbol. Rather, I will use the practical orthography to indicate these.
Sequences of verbal morphemes that I write as single words correspond
to grammatical words (they may, of course, also correspond to phono­
logical words), and the sub-word morphological units will be set off from
each other by hyphens.
Another interesting example of the contrast between phonological
and grammatical words involves the very common Yimas construction
of verb compounding or serialization, in which two or more verb roots
join to form a complex verb, as seen in examples such as these:
(2-26) a. urauknut

V PL 0-3PL A-split-SEQ-break-SEQ-tie-PERF
'They split the branches, broke (them) and tied ( them) .'
Each of these verbs corresponds to more than one phonological word,
as shown by the number of primary stresses marked in each example.
Yet they each clearly correspond to one grammatical word. First of all,
negation applies to the verb as a whole, demoting the first pronominal
prefix to the end of the full sequence of morphemes.

Further, valence increasing also applies to the verb compound as a whole.

Interestingly, it is in the area of compounds where nouns also show
a split between the phonological and grammatical word, albeit not as
extreme as that for the verbs. Yimas has a productive system of noun
eompounding employing the oblique ease suffix on the first member of
the compound, rather like the use of the genitive ease in German noun
compounds.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"

5.2.2 Modality
Modality describes the actuality of an event, whether it is realized or not
(this was termed ""status"" in Foley and Van Valin 1984, 213-8) . This is
covered partially in Yimas by the contrast between the irrealis and the
tense suffixes, and indeed in some languages, modality is viewed largely
as a binary distinction between irrealis and realis. However, within
the irrealis dimension, languages often recognized further distinctions,
whether the action is necessary, likely, or merely possible. Yimas is one
of these languages, and these additional modal distinctions are provided
by a set of modal prefixes: ta- NEG, ant- POT, and ka- LIKE.
5.2.2.1 Negation
The modal prefixes are a particularly complicated area of Yimas gram­
mar, often requiring re-arrangements of the verbal morphology. The
negative prefix ta- is typical in this regard. The basic rule is that the
lowest ranked participant, rather than being realized as the leftmost
prefix, is expressed through a suffix following the tense suffix. In other
words, its position is usurped by the negative prefix, so it appears as
a suffix. As intransitive verbs have only a single prefix, that of the S
argument, they represent the simplest case and for ease of exposition, it
is best to start with them.
Consider first the contrast between the following positive and nega­
tive intransitive verbs with first person S arguments:
(5-98) a. (i)b. (i)ama-wa-t

As verbs in a serial verb construction form a single, albeit complex,
verb theme, they constitute a single grammatical word. Hence, other
words should not be able to be inserted between them, breaking the
integrity of the word. This predication is indeed borne out (compare
the example below with (6-94a)) .

Such insertions, however, should be no problem in a dependent verb
chain, for each verb constitutes a separate word. This is, in fact, the
case.

Note that the fundamental structural contrast between the ungrammat­
ical structures of (6-96) and the grammatical ones in (6-97) is the place­
ment of the pronominal affixes. If they occur on the first verb root but
not the second, the structure is interpreted as a serial verb construction;
if on the second but not the first, it is recognized as a dependent verb
chain. The reason has to do with the linking of pronominal affixes to
tense inflection; the tense inflection licenses their appearance. Thus,
in (6-96) the tense inflection occurs on the second verb root, forcing a328THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREstructural interpretation of this and the previous verb root as a single
unit, i.e., a serial verb construction. Because this sequence is interrupted
by the intrusion of other words, these examples are ungrammatical. But
in (6-97) the verb inflected for tense also co-occurs with the pronominal
affixes, establishing only this as a coherent unit. The previous verb is
therefore determined to be a dependent verb, not an element in a serial
verb construction, and hence the two verbs may be freely separated by
other words.
Another formal difference between serial verb constructions and de­
pendent verb chains is in their behavior under negation. Serial verb
constructions can only be negated as a whole, as befits their semantic
function of encoding a single event. The semantic scope of the negative
can be restricted to only one verb stem in the serial structure, or may
negate all verb stems; negation with serial verb constructions is ambigu­
ous. But only one occurrence of the negative prefix is allowed, at the
beginning of the entire verb.

'I did not push the canoe down into the water.' (I pushed it
onto the ground) or
'I did not push the canoe down into the water.' (I was sleeping
and did nothing to the canoe, and so it is still on the ground)
Because dependent verb chains constitute separate clauses which encode
distinct events, one would expect that ta- NEG could occur separately
on the verb stems. This is true, but it must occur on the independent
verb, the one that carries tense.

Note that the scope of ta- NEG is still over both verbs in (6-99), even
though it only occurs on the second, independent verb. In order to block
this, the first verb must be an independent verb, either in a subordinate
(6-lOOa) or coordinate (6-lOOb) linkage (see Sections 7.2.3 and 7.3.2).","[342, 343, 344]"
"TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD253The same negative number suffixes again reference the number of the
S argument, but the third person forms contrast with the first person
forms in ( 5-98) in that all distinctions in number in the pronominal
prefixes are lost. All four numbers in the third person are expressed
by the same prefix pu-, the normal S/0 pronominal prefix for third
plural. Note further that whereas the negative forms for intransitive
verbs with first person S arguments reveal an underlying nominative­
accusative role-marking schema in that the S argument is realized by
the A prefix form, third person arguments continue to show an ergative­
absolutive alignment in both positive and negative forms. Thus, all third
person S arguments regardless of number are expressed in negated verbs
by the pronominal prefix pu- 3 PL S/0, the actual number being carried
by the negative number suffixes. I will again take up this question of
the accusative versus ergative split in negative verbs when discussing
transitive verbs below.
Second person S arguments show an interesting feature as a result
of the inflectional patterns of the positive verbs. Remember that the
pronominal prefix n- is homophonous for 2/3SG A, but that the other
numbers in second person show no similarity with third person. This
overlap is also exhibited in the negative verbs. Negative verbs with
second singular S arguments have pu- (typical of third person), and the
pronominal prefix n-, the normal form for second singular A, used in
this case for an S argument (demonstrating again the usual nominative­
accusative pattern for first and second person arguments) . Consider the
following examples:
(5-100) a. ta-pu-n-wa-t
NEG-3-2SG S-go-PERF
'You didn't go. '
b. ta-nan-wa-r-um
NEG-2PL S-go-PERF-PL
'You all didn't go. '
Thus, although in positive verbs n - 2/3SG A is homophonous, the dif­
ference in negative verbs in morphological behavior of first and second
person S arguments, on the one hand, and third person, on the other,
ensures that the negative forms for verbs with second and third singular
S arguments are distinct; compare (5-lOOa) with (5-99a(ii)) .
S o far I have only considered intransitive verbs with human, pronom­
inal S arguments. An inanimate noun, of course, can also function as
an S argument, but in this case, instead of one of the negative number
suffixes above, the possessive/adjective concord marker corresponding
to the class and number of the inanimate noun is used to reference it.","[268, 269]"

-The Yimas Language
of New Guinea1The Language and Its Speakers1 . 1 Linguistic Type
Yimas belongs to the grouping of languages spoken in the Pacific known
as Papuan languages .. Languages of the New Guinea area are generally
divided into two large groupings: Austronesian languages and Papuan
languages. The Austronesian languages all belong to the far-flung Aus­
tronesian language family, stretching east to west from Southeast Asia
to Hawaii, and north to south from Formosa to New Zealand. Most of
the roughly 250 Austronesian languages of the New Guinea area (and
all of those in Papua New Guinea) belong to a single subgroup of the
family known as the Oceanic subgroup.
Papuan languages are quite different in this respect. The 750 or so
Papuan languages do not constitute a single, genetically unified language
family, but rather are organized into about sixty different language fam­
ilies averaging ten member languages each. With much more careful and
detailed comparative work, some of these language families will undoubt­
edly be combined into larger genetic groupings, as the Celtic, Germanic,
and Slavic language families among others have been combined to form
the Indo-European language family. Wurm (1982) presents some hy­
potheses in this direction, but at this point nearly all of these need to
be verified by careful comparative work.
With so many Papuan language families composed of so many dis­
tinct languages, it is very difficult to describe what a 'typical' Papuan
language is, as all generalizations will be contradicted by one language
or indeed one language family. Nonetheless, I attempted just this in
Foley 1986, and I will summarize here how Yimas fits with the charac­
terizations of Papuan languages proposed in that work. Yimas is one
of six member languages of the Lower Sepik family (see Section 1 .4 for
more discussion of the family, as well as Foley 1986, 214-29). As with
12THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSthe other languages of the family, it is morphologically agglutinative,
employing both prefixes and suffixes. Word order is highly variable and
quite free, although some other languages in the family have a weak
preference for Subject/ Object/Verb.
The phonological inventory of Yimas is small, even by the stan­
dards of Papuan languages, having only 12 consonants and 4 vowels.
The phonology exhibits many features typical of Sepik area languages.
There are no fricative phonemes; [s] is just an allophonic realization of
the voiceless palatal stop / c /. The language distinguishes four places of
articulation: bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar, with a corresponding
voiceless stop and nasal in each position. There is no voiced/voiceless
distinction for stops, the voiced stops being allophonic realizations of the
voiceless stops in certain positions, such as following nasals. Unusually
for a Papuan language, Yimas has an r/l distinction, but the /1/ is always
palatal(ized) , i.e., [lY] or [.A] , and the /r/ is always dental-alveolar, to a
large extent varying freely between [l] and [r] as phonetic realizations.
The vocalic system is typically-one might say prototypically-Sepik.
There is a dearth of vowel phonemes, both abstractly and as the seg­
mental phonemes of particular words. Many words lack underlying vowel
phonemes altogether, and the string of underlying consonants is broken
up in phonetic realization by epenthetic vowels inserted by a phonolog­
ical rule. The only clear unambiguous underlying vowel in the language
is the low central vowel fa/. The three high vowels /i, i, uj are often the
result of vowel epenthesis, the /i/ almost invariably so. The semivowels
jyj and jwj, especially the latter, interact closely with the phonological
rules involving vowels, such that their phonetic realization is often the
result of these rules. Stress is predictable and generally occurs initially.
Yimas has two major word classes, noun and verb. In addition to
these, there are eight minor categories: adjective, quantifier, locational,
temporal, pronoun, deictic, conjunction, and interjection. There are
only three true adjectives in Yimas; other roots corresponding to adjec­
tives in English belong to the major classes of verb and noun. Quantifiers
must be treated as a separate word class from adjectives in Yimas due to
their highly divergent morphology. Locationals and temporals are two
adverb-like parts of speech, expressing the spatial and temporal orien­
tations of events. They both share some of the features of nouns, such
as the occasional ability to pluralize. The number distinctions of Yimas
pronouns are much richer than in most other Papuan languages. In ad­
dition to the usual three persons, Yimas pronouns distinguish four num­
bers: singular, dual, paucal (a few), and plural (more than a few). De­
ictics exhibit a three-way distinction: place near the speaker, place near
the addressee, and place near neither of these. There are over sixty ofLINGUISTIC TYPE3these deictic forms; besides deictic distance, they distinguish noun class
and number of the nominal designating the object whose position they
describe. Like most Papuan languages, Yimas has a very restricted set
of conjunctions (some languages in the central highlands of Papua New
Guinea lack them entirely). There are no subordinating conjunctions
and only two coordinating conjunctions, equivalent to 'and' and 'but'.
Nouns in Yimas are characterized by being divided into ten major
classes, plus a few idiosyncratic classes. The criteria for assignment to
noun class are both semantic and phonological. Nouns are obligato­
rily inflected for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) , with the
morphemes indicating number highly variable according to noun class.
Suppletion of the noun stem in the plural form is common. The only
other inflection available to nouns is case, and for this there is only a
single oblique case inflection, which marks nouns functioning in an in­
strumental or locative role. Possession is marked by a particle postposed
to the possessor.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex word class in Yimas,
and they are highly so; about half of this grammar is devoted to verb
morphology. Because of this complexity, Yimas can properly be char­
acterized as an agglutinative polysynthetic language, equal in most re­
spects to the much discussed polysynthetic languages of the Americas.
The verb can occur with many prefixes and suffixes, with the former pre­
dominating. The suffixes largely express notions of tense, aspect, and
mood. The language is very rich in this area, marking, for example, eight
distinct tenses. There are five potentially filled suffixal slots to the verb.
The prefixes are more numerous, with eight potentially filled positions.
The prefixes express notions like modality; agreement for noun class, per­
son and number of core nominals like subject, direct object, and indirect
object (this information can also be expressed by suffixes in some envi­
ronments) ; adverbial notions like place, direction, duration and manner;
and finally, valence alternations to the verb like reciprocal formation,
causativization and applicative verb formation (see Comrie 1985). An­
other common feature of verbs is verb compounding, or serialization.
This is done at the word level, as shown by the fact that the whole set
of verbal prefixes and suffixes flank these compounded verbal forms.
Pronouns in Yimas are not inflected. True pronouns only exist for
first- and second-persons; the so-called third-person independent pro­
nouns are actually deictics, and distinguish noun class and number.
Pronouns are actually rather infrequently used in Yimas, for the simple
reason that the verb has pronominal affixes for the subject, direct object,
and indirect object of the clauses. These affixes exhibit a very complex
1wrson-bascd split for their case-marking schema. First- and second-4THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSperson forms follow an underlying nominative/accusative pattern, and
third-person forms, something like an ergative/absolutive one.
Word order in Yimas is remarkably free, even in comparison to
the relative freedom exhibited by other Papuan languages. Within the
clause, there is no set word order pattern at all (in fact, the majority
of clauses consist of just a verb, so word order is not much of a ques­
tion in these cases anyway) . The verb has a slight tendency to occur
last in a pragmatically unmarked context, with the preceding nominals
in any order, but it is common for a nominal to occur after the verb
with a slightly marked pragmatic force. Word order in Yimas is so free
that noun phrases need not even form a constituent. Yimas exhibits
the 'scrambled' pattern of noun phrases, well known from Australian
languages, in which a noun and its modifiers can be separated from one
another within the clause. In these cases, the modifiers obligatorily take
concord affixes for the noun class and number of the noun they modify.
Yimas contrasts with many other Papuan languages in making less
extensive use of clause chaining (Foley 1986). Yimas completely lacks a
productive morphological system of switch reference: the same form of a
medial dependent verb form can be used before another verb regardless
of whether they share the same subject or not. The most common type
of clause linkage in Yimas involves nominalization, both finite and non­
finite. Finite nominalizations in Yimas correspond to relative and ad­
verbial subordinate clauses in more familiar languages, while non-finite
nominalizations are like infinitive complements and gerunds. Yimas can
also link clauses through coordination, by simple juxtaposition, or by
using one of its two conjunctions.
Yimas discourse strikes an English speaker as very dense. Because
of the pronominal agreement affixes, overt nominals are rare and carry
strong contrastive emphasis. This results in the text often consisting
of little more than verbs over long stretches. The highly incorporating,
agglutinative morphology of the verb further contributes to this impres­
sion of density: much information is carried by the bound affixes of the
verb, in contrast to the independent words of a language like English.
This can put heavy processing loads on the hearer in trying to decipher
a verb consisting of ten morphemes.
Yimas is spoken in two villages, totaling about 250 people. One vil­
lage is the original village site, and the other has only recently hived
off from that village, since 1970 or so. There is constant traveling back
and forth between the two villages, most people spending some time
each year in both. Only a small minority live exclusively in one or the
other village, but even these make day trips between the two, which are
separated by about 15 km. Because of this situation, there is no geo-LINGUISTIC TYPE5graphically based dialect differentiation in the Yimas language. There is,
however, significant socially based differentiation according to age. All
speakers under 40 have grown up bilingual in Tok Pisin, and this has
influenced their Yimas to a greater or lesser extent. Even older male
speakers who grew up monolingually in Yimas and learned Tok Pisin
while serving stints as recruited plantation labor show this influence to
some extent. Older women speak the least affected Yimas and show the
lowest degree of fluency in Tok Pisin.
Tok Pisin is the prestige language and its influence on Yimas has two
effects. First, Tok Pisin words are borrowed into Yimas. This borrowing
may be so heavy that the speaker's talk may resemble a code switching­
like discourse, containing snatches of Yimas followed by Tok Pisin. In
other cases, Tok Pisin forms are borrowed into what is otherwise pure
Yimas. These may be nativized to such an extent that speakers are
unaware of the words' ancestry. Second, the very complex morphology
of Yimas is subject to simplification. Verbs have fewer morpheme slots
filled, and irregular and suppletive forms are regularized. In some cases
these irregular forms may be lost altogether. For example, almost no
speakers under 40 can completely control the highly complex and irreg­
ular numeral system. In daily use these are replaced by the Tok Pisin
numbers. The whole impression of the Yimas of younger speakers is its
simplicity and regularity relative to the highly complex and irregular
language of older (especially female) speakers. The language described
principally in this grammar is of men now in their late thirties, who
grew up in an almost purely monolingual Yimas environment, and who
speak a relatively rich and elaborate version of the language. Regular­
izations and changes in the speech of younger speakers will be noted
when relevant.
The influence of Tok Pisin on Yimas is now reaching its logical out­
come among the very young. Many young children in the Yimas commu­
nities, especially those under seven years of age, are not learning Yimas
at all and are certainly growing up with Tok Pisin as their first language.
Whether they will learn Yimas as a second language around ten years
of age or slightly older is not clear at the moment, but this seems un­
likely, given the status attached to Tok Pisin (Foley 1986, 27-8) and the
great morphological complexity of Yimas, which puts a great burden on
simple memory in language acquisition. In traditional times, the single
greatest intellectual task facing a Yimas child was probably learning his
language. But now with schooling and other Western accoutrements,
there are other claims on his time. It is perhaps too early to say that
the Yimas language is dying, but it must be admitted that the prognosis
is not good.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"

'He has money, and he will go. '
I n both examples o f (5-137), the first clause sets up the condition of
having money, and the second predicates the act of going in relation
to that condition. The potential prefix has the unmarked reading of a
possible event, but one which in the normal course of events will not
occur. Hence the presence of the negative in the English translation of
(5-136a) , not present in the original. The potential prefix ant- breaks
the expectation of the normal relation between the two clauses. Note
the conjunction kanta 'but' which informants required here. The likely
prefix has none of these negative expectations; it simply indicates that
the event of the second clause is a probable event, given the conditions
of the first clause.
Perhaps the most common usage of the likely modal prefix is to form
a kind of indirect imperative, an injunction. This construction combines
ka- LIKE with the imperative/hortative suffix - n """" - na (see Section
5.2.3.1) to mean 'let Y do Y'. X must be a third person participant.

5.2.3 Mood
Mood is the verbal category which expresses the speech act value of an
utterance, i.e., whether it is a statement, question, command, exhorta­
tion, wish, etc. The most common mood categories in Yimas, declar­
ative and interrogative, are not morphologically marked. Statements,
utterances in declarative mood, are indicated by a sharp final fall in in­
tonation, while questions, the interrogative mood, have a corresponding
rise.","[283, 284]"
"NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS407The noun modified by the non-finite relative clause in (7-66b) is kumpwi
'boys'. This is marked on the relative clause by the concord suffix - i I PL.
Example (7-68a) lacks an overt independent 'head' noun for the relative
clause. Rather it is simply represented by the pronominal agreement
prefix kay- lPL A, and this in turn is linked to the coreferential concord
suffix -mat following -kakan 'without' in the relative clause. The final
example illustrates a negative non-finite relative clause modifying an
inanimate noun, in this case, houses DL, indicated by the proper concord
suffixed - nml 'houses' DL following -kakan 'without' (with loss of its final
/n/ before the initial /n/ of - nml houses DL).
Negative non-finite relative clauses contrast with positive ones in that
they are not restricted to S or A participants as the relativized noun.
Rather they permit any core argument to function as such, and this
often results in ambiguity.

that people don't kill. ,{}The first reading in (7-69) comes from taking the relativized noun to be
the A argument of the relative clause, while the second takes it as the
0. Further examples of this ambiguity are in the examples of (7-68): in
the (a) example the relativized noun is the A participant, while in (b)
it is the 0 .
Non-Finite Oblique Clauses
One of the most common features of Yimas narratives is a type of non­
finite clause whose function is rather like English participles in - ing in
examples like sitting in the chair, he saw the mouse underfoot. As with
English participles, the corresponding Yimas constructions are not in­
flected for tense but are assigned the same tense as the following fully
inflected main verb. The Yimas construction also has much the same
meaning as English - ing participles: to express an event basically simul­
taneous with that of the main verb.
Non-finite oblique clauses are formed like most non-finite clauses in
Yimas, with - ru suffixed to a verb. This is followed by one of the concord
suffixes. This codes the number and gender or class of the S or A par­
ticipant of the oblique clause, which may or may not be overtly present.
Finally"" comes the oblique suffix, - n ""' - nan. The oblique suffix always
takes the form -JtaTI following the Huffixes ending in /t/ indicating that
7.1.5408INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSthe underlying forms of these suffixes actually terminate in palatals. But
as the oblique suffix is the only morpheme to follow them there is no
independent way to ascertain this. Also, the final /IJ/ of the suffix - mav
F SG is always lost before the oblique suffix.
Consider the following examples:

As with all the other non-finite constructions in Yimas, these non-finite
oblique clauses are again nominalizations, for only nominals may be
suffixed with the oblique suffix. In each of these examples the agentive
nominalization suffixes mark the number of the S (examples (7-70a,d,e),NoN-FINITE NoMINALIZATIONS409or A (examples (7-70b,c) argument of the oblique clause, which otherwise
may be completely lacking, as is the case in all the above examples,
except (7-70a,e). Verbs in non-finite oblique clauses may be suffixed
with -kia; this is in fact obligatory if the main verb is marked with -kia,
as in examples (7-70a,c,e). It is not uncommon for -kia in these non­
finite oblique clauses to be followed immediately by -k IRR and then - ru
NFN, as in the following example:
(7-71) mpa irm-kia-k-r-ukt-]lan
now stand-NEAR-IRR-NFN-PC-OBL
paukra-na-ma-uka-pu-kia-k
lPL S-DEF-in-go by land-away-NEAR-IRR
'Standing now, we few walked inside.'
Constructions like (7-71) plus its use in purpose clauses and elsewhere
(to be discussed in Section 7.2.2) suggest that the irrealis is well on
its way to being re-analyzed as a non-finite marker. Another point in
support of this view is that -k IRR can sometimes replace -ru NFN
altogether in these constructions as in ( 7-72) below. (Note that verbs
in non-finite oblique clauses can and commonly do consist of a serial
verb construction forming a complex verb theme. One such example is
(7-70c).)
A very important point of contrast between non-finite oblique clauses
and the other non-finite constructions discussed in this chapter is that
they are never obligatorily controlled. As we have seen, the S and A par­
ticipants of these clauses can be freely omitted, but if this is done, they
are not always completely recoverable within the sentence. For example,
the A participant of (7-70b) need not be kumpwi 'boys'. It could just as
easily, and perhaps more likely, be ipa 'we', with the sentence meaning
'while we were building a house, the boys left the village'. Note also that
in examples (7-70c,d) the S and A participants of the non-finite oblique
clause correspond to no core argument of the main clause of the sentence
which contain them. They are, however, equivalent to core participants
in previous sentences. As a further example of these discourse-controlled
missing S/ A participants in non-finite oblique clauses, consider the fol­
lowing example:

3SG 0-lSG A-call-NEAR-RM PAST
'And right then I told those two ""Light a fire! I'm very
hungry."" Then while we were sitting, Kayan paddled in
toward us and I called out to him.'
In this example, the S participant of the non-finite oblique clause con­
sisting of tay mpa taw-kia-k-vkt-pan 'while sitting down' is 'we', never
mentioned explicitly in the discourse, but is the group consisting of the
speaker and companions. The speaker, of course, was the A participant
of the previous clause and his companions that of the clause before.
That the speaker and his companions are the S of the non-finite oblique
clause is simply established by inference of the hearer.
While the above examples establish that the referent of a missing S
or A participant need not be in the sentence containing the non-finite
oblique clause, it is, of course, the case that they may be. More often
than not, the referent is a core argument of the main clause joined to
the non-finite clause. Example (7-71) above illustrates this. The S of
the main clause is also the S of the non-finite oblique clause. Further
examples are in (7-73) in which the referent is the A (7-73a) or the D
(7-73b) in the main clause.

Because the referent of the missing S or A argument can be corefer­
ential with any core argument or indeed none at all, sentences containingNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS411them can be ambiguous, if the agreement suffixes are right. Consider
the following examples:
(7-74) pu-kra-ant-t
pan-t-mat-jlan
3PL A-lPL 0-hear-PERF pound sago-NFN-M PL-OBL
'They heard us when pounding sago.' (either they or we could
be pounding sago)
The verb in the non-finite oblique clause is coded as having a plural S
argument by the suffix - mat M PL. But both core arguments of the main
clause are plural, so that both can serve as referents for the missing S
argument, resulting in the sentence being ambiguous.
Yimas also possesses negative non-finite oblique clauses in addition
to the positive ones. Like the negative non-finite relative clauses, these
are formed with -kakan plus agentive nominalization or class concord
suffixes, which again mark the number and gender or noun class of the S
or A argument of the oblique clause, which may or may not be overt. Fol­
lowing this comes the oblique suffix - n ""' - nan, exactly as with their pos­
itive counterparts. As we have seen, positive non-finite oblique clauses
express states which hold or events which occur within the time frame
of the main verb, i.e., they must be simultaneous. Negative non-finite
oblique clauses are simply the converse of this: they express states or
events which may not occur during the time frame of the main verb.
The practical effect of this is to produce a conditional sentence 'if not X,
then Y' (for more detailed discussion on conditionals, see Section 7 2 3)

"YIMAS AS A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE279These sentences are nearly synonymous, and both are regarded as gram­
matical by native speakers. (There may be a subtle semantic difference
between them equivalent to 'He turned and came toward her' (6-2a) ver­
sus 'He turned toward her and came (toward her) ' (6-2b), but all speak­
ers queried regarded them as practically equivalent. Note that while
the two English sentences above have different structures and might be
said to have different meanings, they clearly can denote the same event.)
The formal difference between the two examples in (6-2) concerns the
placement of the allative valence increasing prefix ira- 'toward, because
of' (see Section 6.2.3.3.3). It is this prefix which sanctions the 0 prefix
na- 3SG 0 for this complex which only contains two intransitive verbs,
way- 'turn' and ya- 'come'. Note that regardless of whether ira- ALL
is placed immediately before ya- (6-3a) or precedes both verb roots (63b), it still licenses the appearance of na- 3SG 0 at the beginning of the
whole verb, demonstrating its integrity as a single grammatical word.
A final argument in favor of the analysis of the complex expressions
in ( 6-1 ) as single words concerns the behavior of modifying forms such as
those for aspect, modality, and mood. Note that the aspectual marker
nanav- DUR modifies both verbs in (6-1b) , as does the negative prefix
in (6-1c). This latter does not mean * 'again those few did not see her,
but they again came back'. This principle also applies to the scope of
mampi 'again' in this example: it modifies both verbs. In the text from
which (6-1c) is drawn, the expression describes the second time in which
someone who has fallen out of a canoe is ignored and the people paddled
on. Thus, the intended interpretation: ""Again those few did not see her
and again those few did not come back (for her).""
These arguments establish fairly conclusively that the constructions
in ( 6-1) are best analyzed as single words. Thus, Yimas is a polysynthetic
language. There is a very strong tendency throughout Yimas grammar
to reduce complex expressions to single words, as befits its polysynthetic
status. In the above examples, clauses and even complex sentences are
realized as single words. This tendency also finds articulation in the
system of nominals, discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.6. As pointed out,
Yimas productively forms compounds with two nouns, the head noun
to the right and the other suffixed with the oblique suffix - n ""' - nan.

These nominal compounds are further examples of this polysynthetic
tendency to reduce complex expressions to single words. That these
form single words is indicated by the fact that they may serve as the
head of possessive constructions,
(6-4) [ama-na

'my domesticated pig'
while true noun phrases may not.

1SG-POSS big pig III SG
These same constraints apply to the tightly knit noun phrases con­
sisting of a modifier plus a noun discussed in Section 4.6. In many ways
these too behave as single words. For example, the oblique suffix may
occur only once, on the head noun,
(6-6) a. [rna
kay]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
*
b. ma-nan
kay-Jlan

while in the loose, scrambling type of nominal constituents, it may occur
on both modifier and noun.
(6-7) kay-Jlan
ma-y-Jlan
canoe VIII SG-OBL other- VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe.'
The moral of this discussion of Yimas as a polysynthetic language is
that Yimas is one language in which the distinction between the gram­
matical levels of word and phrase is hazy at best and perhaps non­
existent. (In the next chapter we shall see that a similar haziness applies
to the border between clause and sentence.) Basically, it is the genius of
Yimas to employ many grammatical devices in a conspiracy to reduce
phrase-level units to word-level ones. This is closely related to the fact
that Yimas is syntactically a very flat language (see Hale 1983; Blake
1983): that is, the basic relations in Yimas syntactic constructions are
syntagmatic, forms following forms in linear sequence, rather than in aSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES281hierarchical arrangement. We shall see many examples of this property
in the next two chapters. One of the results of this resistance to hierar­
chy is that phrase-level structures are formally rather like words. Thus,
instead of [black[dog]), in which the hierarchical structure is indicated by
the level of bracketing, the Yimas equivalent is rather more like [black­
dog] , in which the components are syntagmatically related on the same
level.
Returning now to the examples in (6-1), it will be noted that I have
marked off a sequence of morphemes in each example by enclosing them
within brackets. This simply sets off the verbal morphology discussed
in the previous chapter from the rest of the verb whose structure will
be discussed in this chapter. A verb is made up of the basic verbal
morphology already presented, which corresponds to the verb periphery
and what I will term the verb theme. Verb themes may themselves be
complex, composed at least of one verb stem plus a set of optional verbal
affixes and incorporated adverbials. For example, in (6-la) the verb
theme is composed of the verb stem takat- 'touch' plus the prefixes pay­
'first' and ma- 'in'. The verb theme of (6-lc) is composed of two verb
stems taympi- 'see' and waraca- 'return' plus the incorporated adverbial
mampi- 'again' . A verb stem is in turn composed of no more than one
verb root plus optional derivational affixes. In (6- le), the verb stem is
composed of the verb root kulanav 'walk' and the derivational affixes
tav- COM and tal- CAUS.
The last chapter dealt with the basic verbal morphology of pronomi­
nal affixes: tense, aspect, modality, and mood. These categories form the
basis of the verb periphery and correspond to the morphemes which oc­
cur outside the verb theme, those morphological categories which apply
to it as a whole. In this chapter ,I will be concerned with the morphol­
ogy internal to the verb theme, that complex verbal morphology which
is particularly indicative of Yimas as a polysynthetic language. Because
this morphology is so complex, it is necessary to proceed from the basic
units and build up the morphological structure of the theme, brick by
brick. Thus, we start with the structure of the verb stem and its con­
struction from a verb root and, more specifically, with the question of
the transitivity of Yimas verbs.
6.2 Stem Derivational Processes
6.2.1 The Concept of Transitivity
Yimas is a language in which it is very important to make a clear dis­
tinction between the syntactic-semantic notion of the valence of a verb
and the formal morphological idea of transitivity. Very often there is a
mismatch between these two concepts, much more so than in more fa-282THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmiliar languages like English. In Yimas, transitivity is defined formally,
by the number of overt pronominal affixes present: an intransitive verb
has no more than one pronominal affix, a transitive verb has two, and
a ditransitive verb has three. Valence, on the other hand, is a lexical
feature of verbs, either basic verb roots or derived verb stems and verb
themes. Verbs with one associated core argument are monovalent, those
with two are bivalent and those with three are trivalent. Yimas neither
allows verbs with more than three pronominal prefixes nor possesses
verbs, either basic or derived, with more than three core arguments.
In English and many other languages, there is generally a straight­
forward correspondence between transitivity and valence: monovalent
verbs are intransitive, bivalent verbs are transitive, and trivalent verbs
are ditransitive. This is not always transparently so in Yimas. First of
all, as pointed out in Section 5.1.6, overt pronominal affixes are not oblig­
atory, but are linked to pragmatic functions like givenness, etc. Hence
it is not unusual for a trivalent verb like va- 'give' to appear as an in­
transitive or simple transitive verb, with only one or two pronominal
prefixes.
(6-8) m-n
patn
ka-ua-ua-n
NR DIST-1 SG betelnut V SG LIKE-lSG D-give-PRES
'He will give me betelnut.'
Or a bivalent verb like wampaki 'throw' can be used intransitively with
only a single pronominal affix.
(6-9) nmpi
ay-cra-wampak-Jla-ukt
leaf VII PL HORT PL-around-throw-IMP-PC
'Let us few distribute letters.'
Examples like these were discussed earlier in Section 5.1.6, and it was
claimed there that they present cases of zero pronominal affixes. With
this analysis, the valence and transitivity of these verbs are in a one­
to-one correspondence; this is simply disguised by the zero pronominal
prefixes. By virtue of the completeness constraint, zero pronominal pre­
fixes are, of course, directly linked to core nominal arguments such as
patn 'betelnut' or nmpi 'leaves', so that all argument slots of these verbs
are in fact filled.
More problematic are common cases like those below, in which a
verb is marked with more pronominal prefixes than are called for by its
valence.

Ditransitive verbs with both first and second person participants are pro­
hibited from marking both with pronominal affixes (see Section 5.1.3).
These are morphologically simple transitive verbs and are subject to the
same rules for negation as described for transitive verbs above. The only
exception concerns mpan-, which indicates a first person A and a second
singular D. In negative verbs this prefix remains unchanged, and again
the theme appears as a suffix.

'I didn't show you it (the coconut).'
b. ipa ta-mpan-tkam-r-IJ
lPL NEG-1A/2SG D-show-PERF-VI SG
'We didn't show you it (the coconut).'
When verbs with the paucal suffix are negated, the paucal suffix often
appears in its non-final form, -vkan PC, and is followed by a negative
number suffix.

The reader will have noticed that examples (7-128b,c) lack the stem m­
NR DIST. This simply is due to the morphological constraint against
having m- precede two pronominal prefixes; both of these examples have
an 0 and an A prefix. In all of these examples, the tense specification
of the oblique clause is identical to that of the main clause. This is not
actually required, but is almost always the case. This morphological fea­
ture distinguishes these sequential oblique clause from the simultaneous
ones, which allow a present tense, regardless of the tense of the verb of
the main clause.
In the absence of any other markers, a sequential temporal relation­
ship is always entailed between a finite oblique clause and the main
clause. This is illustrated in (7-128a). There are no morphemes which
specifically express the sequential temporal relationship between the
clauses; this is simply the force of the construction. However, the other
three examples do have overt morphemes to indicate sequentiality. In
(7-128b) the conjunctions tay and mnta both mean 'then' and indicate
that the clause preceding the one in which they are found describes
events which are temporally prior. Example (7-128c) has the temporal
morpheme in the oblique clause. This is the incorporated adverbial pay­
'first' which indicates that the clause containing it describes events oc­
curring before those of the clause following. Finally, the finite oblique
clause in (7-128d) contains the temporal tampin 'after, later, behind',
which has much the same function as its English translation equivalent.
This last form is very likely a calque on the equivalent use of the Tok
Pisin adverb bihain 'after', and I suspect it is not traditional usage.
Yinias has no overt and distinct way of expressing adverbial clauses
equivalent to English cauHal dauHeH with bP-cau.� e or .�ince. This meaning440INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSis just an additional contextually based inference drawn from a finite
oblique clause in a sequential relationship to the main clause. A good
example is the following:
(7-129) m-mpu-na-malak-nt-mp-n
NR DIST-3PL S-DEF-converse-PRES-VII SG-OBL
pu-na-ti-kratk-n
3SG S-DEF-RCP-fight-PRES
'When/because they are arguing, they fight each other.'
A simple sequential temporal relational-they argue and then they
fight-is all that is necessarily entailed by this example. But given
the nature of the events of the two clauses, arguing and fighting, in
the real world, there is a very high likelihood that there is more than
this temporal relationship between them. More precisely, it would al­
most certainly be the case that the arguing led to the fighting as a
causal force. This is not entailed by (7-129) , but it is clearly a very
favored inference. Of course, how strongly favored this causal inference
would be varies with the events encoded, but it is potentially available
to any finite oblique clause and main clause in a sequential temporal
relationship.
Conditionals and counterfactuals are also expressed in Yimas by the
same kind of construction. What distinguishes these from sequential
and simultaneous temporal clauses is the presence of verbal affixes as­
sociated with unreal events, such as the irrealis suffix or modal prefixes.
Finite oblique clauses functioning as conditional clauses express events
which have not yet occurred, but which will lead, if they do occur, to the
consequential events described in the main clause. Hence, the tenses of
the main clause must be those of events not yet realized: imperfective,
near/remote future, irrealis, or the imperative mood. The tense of the
conditional clause can be identical to that of the main clause, marking
absolute tense (although the imperative, of course, is blocked in embed­
ded clauses); irrealis, indicating indefinite time; or either imperfective
or perfective, marking relative tense. Imperfective in the conditional
clause indicates simultaneity with the main clause (7-130a); perfective
indicates that the event of the conditional clause occurs prior to that of
the main clause (7-130b).

d. kunampwi pay-k-nan ampan-a-tu-n
axe V SG lie-IRR-OBL HORT 1A/2SG 0-DEF-kill-PRES
'If I had an axe, I would kill you'
Examples (7-130a,b) illustrate relative tense in the conditional clause,
imperfective (simultaneous with main clause) or perfective (prior to main
clause). Example (7-130d) shows irrealis for the conditional clause; this
indicates a general, not temporally bounded condition for the event of
the main clause. Finally, example (7-130c) has the remote future in both
the main and the conditional clause.
Conditionals contrast with counterfactuals in that while the former
are concerned with events which have not yet occurred, the latter de­
scribe situations which might or might not have occurred and then
expound the consequences of this. While the main clauses following
conditionals are marked with tenses for unrealized events, those follow­
ing counterfactuals have the tenses of realized events, the multiple past
tenses (and the irrealis, if used as a legendary past) and the perfective
and imperfective. In addition, the main clauses with counterfactuals are
invariably prefixed with ant- POT, the modal prefix encoding potential,
but probably unrealized actions (except for the negative copula verbs
tampan and kayak which do not permit this prefix). The verb of oblique
counterfactual clauses is also usually prefixed with ant- POT, but it may
be omitted, especially if the verb has no pronominal prefixes (7-131c).
ant- POT, of course, displaces m- NR DIST. Consider these examples of
counterfactual clauses:442INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-131) a. tu�kur� ant-ka-tay-c-mp-n

NR DIST-I PL land VIII SG not have
'If the Yimas did not fight, they would not have land'
Note that the potential modal prefix ant- can have either positive or
negative force in the corresponding English translation. Compare (7131a,b): the verbal forms are morphologically very similar, yet the for­
mer is translated as a positive verb in English and the latter as a nega­
tive. This is because the semantic force of a counterfactual depends on
the actual status in the real world of the event in the clause. Thus, in
the first example the eye was in fact not seen, so in the counterfactual
the clause is positive; but in the second, the patrol officer did indeed
come, so the counterfactual clause is negative.
Note that the tenses in the counterfactual clauses of all these exam­
ples correspond to those of realized events: perfective (7-131a), remote
past (7-131b,d), and imperfective (7-131c). Counterfactual clauses are
of two semantic types. The first type are those which describe poten­
tial events which failed to happen, with the main clause expressing theFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS443consequential events which would have occurred if the events of the
counterfactual clause had eventuated. Examples (7-131a,c) illustrate
this type. In (7-131a) the speaker would have killed the crocodile if he
had seen the eye, but because he failed to see it, he therefore did not kill
the crocodile. For (7-131c), the speaker would have lit a fire if he had
firewood, but because he has none, no fire is lit.
The second type of counterfactual clauses are those which describe
actual real events which occurred, but pose the hypothetical, counterfac­
tual situation of them not happening, with the event of the main clause
being the consequence of their non-occurrence. Examples (7-128b,d) il­
lustrate this type. The patrol officer did indeed come to Yimas, so the
counterfactual clause does express an actual event. But it poses the
counterfactual situation of his not coming, with the situation described
in the main clause being the result of his non-appearance. Similarly,
in (7-128d) the Yimas did indeed fight fiercely and have an abundance
of rich land. But the counterfactual clause posits the hypothetical sit­
uation of their not fighting, and conjectures the result would be a lack
of land.
The final semantic category of subordinate clauses formed on this
pattern are concessives. These are quite rare in Yimas and are formed
with the finite oblique clause in the sentence being positive and the main
clause negative.
The following example is illustrative:
i-ka-ak-r-mp-n
(7-132) kay
canoe VIII SG VIII SG 0-1SG A-push-PERF-VII SG-OBL
arm-n
ta-ka-wul-c-i
water-OBL NEG-1SG A-put down-PERF-VIII SG
'Although I pushed the canoe, I did not put it down into the
water.'
There is one final type of finite oblique clause to consider, manner
clauses, but these are formed quite differently from those treated far.
Rather than with - mp VII SG and - n ,...., - nan OBL, finite manner clauses
are formed using the suffix - nti 'act'.
Consider these examples:

3.7 Pronouns
Yimas has a very rich inventory of pronominal forms, but most of these
are bound morphemes and will be discussed in the relevant sections of
the morphology. I will only be concerned here with pronouns which
are free independent words. True pronouns in Yimas only belong to
the first- and second-persons, i.e., refer to the speaker and addressee.
The so-called third-person pronouns refer to participants absent, or not
directly interacting in the immediate, ongoing speech act, and belong
to the word class of deictics in Yimas, to be treated in the following
section.
Besides two persons, Yimas distinguishes four numbers in its pro­
nouns: singular, dual, paucal (a few: from three up to about seven,
but variable depending on context) , and plural. The basic independent
pronouns are
DL
PC
PL
SG
1 ama
kapa
paukt
ipa
2 mi
kapwa
paukt
ipwa
I t. should be noted that for the non-singulars, the second-person formsderived from the first by an infix -w- (this goes back to Proto-Lower
S1�pik; see Foley 1986, 220-1). In fact, in the paucal there is no difference
whatsoever; the two forms are homophonous, the distinction being made
hy cross-referencing verbal person/number prefixes.
Compared to English, these pronouns are used relatively infrequently,
t.lwir basic categories being normally expressed by prefixes to the verb
(Hm� Section 5.1). The free pronouns can be used in combination withare112WORD CLASSESthe verbal prefixes, but then the pragmatic effect is generally contrastive,
i.e., ' it 's me (not you or anyone else) who . . . ' (see Section 5.1.6).
3.8 Deictics
As with many languages, deictics are a rather elaborated part of Yi­
mas grammar. The basic function of a deictic is to locate the position
of an object in space (or in some languages, in time (Becker 1974))
with respect to the positions of the participants in the speech act. The
basic participants in a speech act are the speaker, the addressee, and
the person spoken about (absent from the immediate speech act, but
nonetheless one of its topics). Yimas has a deictic stem corresponding
to each of these three positions. There is a deictic stem -k 'this (near
me)' to refer to things close to the speaker, a stem m- 'that (near you)'
for those close to the addressee and a stem - n 'that yonder (near neither
you nor me) '. All deictics agree in number and noun class with the noun
denoting the objects whose location they are specifying. The proximal
deictic -k and the far distal deictic - n take the set of verb prefixes, while
the near distal deictic m- takes the adjectival suffixes. So for class VII
we would have the following set of nine forms:
-n FR DIST
-k PROX
m- NR DIST
SG
m-n
p-k
p-n
pla-n
pla-k
mpl
DL
PL
pia-n
pia-k
m-rampl 'those two' is a contraction from m- the near distal stem plus - mpl
the adjectival class VII dual suffix.
These deictic forms can be used as modifiers of head nouns (like
adjectives) or as noun phrases in their own right (like pronouns). When
used like adjectives they most commonly occur after the head noun,
as in imp ram pk 'this basket', but this is by no means obligatory, and
the opposite order is also found, pk impram. The former are sometimes
elliptical versions of predicative uses of the deictics with the usual copula
deleted. So we would have examples like the following
(3-30) impram
p-k
papk
basket VII SG VII SG-PROX COP VII SG
'This is a basket.'
The copula in Yimas is a highly complex verb form with many irregu­
larities (see Section 5.1.5) . It agrees for person, number, and class with
the noun it predicates (in the above example, class VII SG) . The forms
of the copula with different person, number, and class combinations are
presented in Section 5.1.5. In the singular (and only for some classes)
the copula makes an additional distinction usually associated with de-DEICTICS113ictics in a number of languages. In these classes, there are two forms in
the singular for the copula, one used for objects which are visible and
one for things invisible.
aykk
(3-31) a. anti
ground VIII SG COP VIII SG VIS
'It's ground (seen) .'
b. anti
ayk
ground VIII SG COP VIII SG INVIS
'It's ground (unseen) . '
(3-32) a . awruk

kawk
bandicoot X SG X SG-PROX COP X SG VIS
'This is a bandicoot (seen) . '
b. awruk
akuk
bandicoot X SG COP X SG INVIS
'It's a bandicoot (unseen).'
The (a) examples above use the visible copula forms and identify ob­
jects seen by the speaker. These are largely identificational uses of the
copula, rather than predicational: the (a) examples would be uttered in
a context when the speaker is holding up a bandicoot or a lump of dirt
and identifying what it is. The (b) examples are used when describing
objects unseen by the speaker and largely correspond to predicational
uses of the copula. For example, (3-32b) would be uttered if on walking
through the bush one heard a rustling sound in the grass, while (331b) would be said if on swimming through the lakes one stood up and
touched bottom. (3-30), with a visible copula form, also corresponds to
a predicational usage and would be a likely answer to a question like
'what are you making?', asked while watching someone weaving. As the
object being woven is visible to both parties in this context, this demon­
�·ltrates that the semantic contrast of visible versus invisible is more basic
than that between identificational and predicational uses. In most cases
the two meanings coincide, so it is in fact difficult to extricate them.
AH mentioned above, the visible/invisible contrast is only found in the
singular and only with some classes; for further discussion of the uses of
the copula and a complete listing of all forms, see Section 5.1.5.
These deictics also function in Yimas as the third-person pronouns.
The unmarked form in this usage is the near distal deictic. In ongoing
narrative discourse, it is this set of forms which are most commonly
used as free pronouns. But in direct quotes in and in normal everyday
('onversational discourse, all three basic forms are employed with the
following meanings. Forms based on the proximal deictic stem -k are
used to refer to participants or objects within the immediate contextWORD CLASSES1 14of the speech act. So in talking about a child sitting next to the two
interlocutors, one would use the form na-k, the proximal form for class
I and II singular, the classes for human beings. The choice between the
near distal and the far distal stems is more subtle. If one wishes to
emphasize the position of the participant or object as being near the
addressee, one could use the near distal stem. Similarly, if one wishes to
emphasize its distance from both major participants, one could use the
far distal form. But both of these reasons for their use would be unusual
and would result in a quite emphatic reading on the deictic, i.e., 'that
thing right here near you' or 'that thing which is certainly far away, not
near you or me'. More commonly, the choice of the near or far distal
deictic stem reflects the centrality of the participant in the discourse or
the speaker's empathy toward it. So, for example, one would talk about
a child using m-n, the near distal form for classes I and II singular, if
he was a central participant in the discourse or we felt good feelings
toward him. The far distal form na-n, on the other hand, is likely to be
used if we are angry at the child or if he is of only passing, secondary
interest.
Corresponding to each of the deictic stems is deictic adverb of place.
These are formed from the same stems plus an affix.
ta-k
m-nti
ta-n'here (near me)'
'there (near you)'
'there (near neither me nor you)'Again the stems -k and -n occur with a prefix in this case ta-, while
m has a suffix - nti. These forms are closely related to the interrogative
deictic, meaning 'where'. Yimas has a stem vka, meaning 'where?',
to which is added the same set of prefixes found on the deictic stems
-k and -n. The basic form is ta-vka 'where', which is used when the
location of an action is queried or when the speaker wishes to be vague
about the object whose location is requested. In all other cases in which
the location of a known object is being sought, the stem -vka must be
prefixed with the proper verbal prefix for the class of the object. Quite
clearly, in Yimas the word 'where?' is a verb. Consider the following
question in (a) with its answer in (b) , employing the class VII singular
noun impram 'basket'.
(3-33) a. impram
p-uka?
basket VII SG VII-where
'Where is the basket?'
tampaymp-n
b. impram
basket VII SG hook VII SG-OBLDEICTICS115p-na-apca-mpi-irm-n
VII SG 8-DEF-hang-SEQ-stand-PRES
'The basket is hanging on the hook. '
In the interrogative (a) sentence, the - vka 'where?' functions as the main
verb, taking the normal verbal prefix for its nominal argument. -vka is
a rather defective verb. It cannot be inflected for any typically verbal
categories like tense, mood, or aspect, nor can it mark the number of its
nominal argument by the prefix; it can mark only class.
Other interrogative words in Yimas are:
(who-SG)
'who (SG)'
naw-n
'who (DL)'
naw-rm
(who-DL)
(who-PC)
' who (PC)'
naw-ukt
(who-PL)

wara pucmp-n (what time VII SG-OBL) 'when'

'why/how'
wara-wal
'how'

'what talk'
wara-mpwi
'what want'

(what-NFN-SG)
'what kind'
wara-t-awt
(how many-act)
ntuk-nti
'how much, how many'
ntuk-mpat
(how many-VII PL)
'when'
As can be clearly seen many of these interrogative words are based on
the stem wara 'what' plus suffixes of nominalizations and complements.
This suggests that like -vka 'where' , wara also has verbal characteristics.
Another set of words to be considered in this section are adverbs of
manner derived from the deictics of place. These are formed by adding
the adverbial suffix - mpi to the proximal and near distal adverbs:
tak 'here' + -mpi > takmpi 'like this'
mnti 'there' + -mpi > mntmpi 'like that'
Interestingly, this suffix can be added to the word tavka 'where?' to
form a derived verb (further demonstrating its status as a verb), as in
the following example:
(3-34) tauka-mpi ya-n-ntak-t
mnta
where-ADV V PL 0-2SG A-leave-PERF then
ma-ya-t
2SG S-come-PERF
'You left (things) where and now you came?'
Here the things left behind are left unspecified, cross-referenced by the
vague, unmarked plural prefix ya- (probably understood as referring to1 16WORD CLASSESthe noun maramara 'things, possessions') . There is no real semantic con­
trast between this sentence and one with the underived tavka, although
the tavkampi form is more likely to be used with action verbs ( espe­
cially motion verbs) and tavka with stative or position verbs. Perhaps
a more accurate translation, then, of tavkampi would be 'in a where-ing
manner? '.
Finally, there are two stems, which on morphological and to a certain
extent semantic grounds, seem best assigned to the deictic word class.
These are kawvkwan- 'something like _' and mntn- 'this sort of _'.
Like the near distal deictic stem m-, these take the adjectival concord
suffixes indicating the class and number of their modified noun.
(3-35) a. anti
kawJJkwan-i
land VIII SG something like-VIII SG
'something like land.'
mntn-put
b. JJaykum
woman II PL this sort-II PL
'these sorts of women.'
mntn-ra
c. yara
tree V PL this sort-V PL
'these sorts of trees. '
3 . 9 Conjunctions
Yimas has only three conjunctions tay 'and then', mnta 'and then' and
kanta 'but'. The second two are obviously built on a stem - nta, to which
is added the near distal deictic stem m- or a negative prefix ka-. Both
of these are coordinating conjunctions. Yimas lacks a disjunctive coor­
dinating conjunction, i.e., 'or' , and all subordinating conjunctions. The
meanings of the latter are expressed through bound affixes to verbs,
sometimes in combination with temporal stems. The conjunction tay
normally introduces a new sentence, but may function to conjoin clauses
within a single sentence. The other two conjunctions kanta and mnta
normally occur after the first element of the second clause they are con­
joining, rather than between the two clauses (as do their English equiv­
alents), although that position is also possible. Consider this example:mnta
(3-36) i-kay-api-wat
kajlut
VIII SG 0-lPL A-put in-HAB black palm X PL then
ura-kay-mampi-api-wat
X PL 0-lPL A-again-put in-HAB
'We put in (the floor supports) and again we put in the
(pieces of) black palm.'","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD259This ambiguity can, of course, be resolved by the use of independent
pronouns.
When the A is first person and the 0 non-singular second person, only
the 0 is marked on the verb. This is in keeping with the rules observed
above with the positive verbs in Section 5.1.2. The negative number
suffix, if present, simply redundantly specifies the number of the 0.
(5-1 14) a. ta-IJkul-cpul-c-rm
NEG-2DL 0-hit-PERF-DL
'I didn't hit you two.'
b. kapa ta-kul-cpul-c-um
lDL NEG-2PL 0-hit-PERF-PL
'We two didn't hit you all.'
If the 0 is second person singular, the suppletive prefix mpan- 1A/2SG
0 is used, but no negative number suffix is allowed. The number of the
A can only be indicated through the use of an independent pronoun.
(5-115) a. ta-mpan-tpul
NEG- 1A/2SG 0-hit
'I didn't hit you.'
b. ipa ta-mpan-tpul
lPL NEG-1A/2SG 0-hit
'We didn't hit you. '
The latter example would be ungrammatical if the negative plural suffix
ump were attached.
Ditransitive verbs which code three participants on the verb through
pronominal affixes present the added complication in the negative of
determining which participant is to be realized as a suffix. In all cases
of ditransitive verbs with three pronominal affixes, it is the theme par­
ticipant which is suffixed in the negative. If the D participant is third
person and hence already a suffix, the theme suffix simply follows this.","[274, 275]"

Thus, the behavior of third singular forms in having 0 marking for num­
ber of S and A, but - nak for 0, indicates a nominative-accusative align­
ment, in spite of the fact that the corresponding positive verb forms are
transparently ergative-absolutive.
Interestingly, this difference in behavior in negative verbs between
third singular A and 0 allows for a distinction which cannot be made in
the corresponding positive verbs. Remember that ykra- is both the A
and 0 form for 1DL. Thus, (5-1 11) is ambiguous.
(5-111) na-J]kra-tpul
3SG A/0-1DL A/0-hit
'He hit us two/we two hit him.'
But this ambiguity disappears in the corresponding negated verbs be­
cause of the difference in behavior between third person singular A and
0 participants.

'He didn't hit us two.'

The final set of negated transitive verbs to consider are those involv­
ing both first and second person participants. The reader is advised
to look back to Section 5.1.2 to review the inflectional system of posi­
tive verbs with this combination. If the A is second person and the 0
is first person, the A is realized simply by the negative number suffix.
Thus, these negated verbs are homophonous to those with third person
A participants.

"INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS412suffix on the main verb. This is typical of negative oblique clauses. The
non-finite oblique clauses are within the same time frame as the main
clause and express events whose non-occurrence right now is responsible
for the circumstances holding in the main clause. Thus, in (7-75a) the
speaker's decision not to return is contingent on whether the women
come or not. If they do not come, the situation of the main clause will
eventuate. Similar remarks apply to (7-75c ). The middle example (775b) is perhaps the most interesting. The failure of the plane to arrive
will leave the speaker and his group without food. This situation is thus
summed up in the query which forms the main clause, 'what do we eat?'.
An interesting difference between positive and negative non-finite
oblique clauses concerns word order possibilities. While core arguments
of positive non-finite oblique clauses can occur after the verb, as exam­
ples (7-70b,e) demonstrate, this is not possible with negative non-finite
oblique clauses. So (7-76) is ungrammatical.

This may indicate that -kakan 'without', like kantk 'with', is a postpo­
sition and governs an NP constituent preceding, blocking any possible
extraction from it.
-7.2 Finite NominalizationsFinite nominalizations contrast with non-finite ones in that they require
a tense suffix and never take -ru NFN. Pronominal affixes may also occur
on verbs in finite nominalizations. Another typical morphological feature
of finite nominalizations, albeit not a universal one, is the near distal
deictic stem m-. The verbs of finite nominalizations commonly occur
suffixed to this stem, replacing the normal class and number concord
suffixes, with the whole forming a complex nominal not unlike m-n NR
DIST-1 SG 'he'. The use of distal deictics to mark relative clauses is
common in Papuan languages (Reesink 1987; Olson 1981) and elsewhere
(note English that). In most languages, this occurs at the boundary of
the relative clause, but in Yimas it is a form bound, like a prefix, to the
inflected verb of the relative clause. This again reflects the polysynthetic
nature of the language; a relative clause will commonly consist of nothing
but a fully inflected verb, suffixed to m- NR DIST. A clause is again
realized as a word-level unit. Finite nominalizations have a similar range
of functions to their non-finite counterparts, except that they are neverFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS413used as complements. Their most common functions are as relative and
oblique (i.e., adverbial) clauses.
7.2.1 Finite Relative Clauses
Finite relative clauses are not an infrequent feature of Yimas discourse.
The verbs in finite relative clauses share a good deal in their morpho­
logical formation with modally inflected verbs, the discussion of which
the reader may care to review (see Section 5.2.2). Finite relative clauses
are typically marked by m- NR DIST, to which the fully inflected verb
is suffixed. (There is a sub-type of finite relative clauses which does not
employ m- NR DIST, and this will be discussed in detail later in this
section.) The stem m- NR DIST functions much like the wh word or
that in English-to mark the whole relative clause as a definite referring
expression. The other obligatory morpheme marking a finite relative is
a class and number concord suffix. These are the adjectival concord suf­
fixes for the various noun classes and occur as the final suffix of the verb,
except that human nouns do not distinguish class, i.e., masculine and
feminine nouns take the same set of suffixes, those found with modally
inflected verbs (see Section 5.2.2).

'the frog which I killed'
[m-ua-tay-nc-u]
c. krayu
frog VI SG NR DIST-lSG 0-see-PRES-VI SG
'the frog watching me'
The suffix -'T)k VI SG (-1) in word final position) occurs on each of the
verbs in these relative clauses, marking the class and number of these
nominalizations and hence indicating what noun is modified by them,
i.e., what are their head nouns. The same class and number concord
suffix is used regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun: S
in (7-77a), 0 in (7-77b), and A in (7-77c). This is typical of lower animate
and inanimate nouns, but higher animate and especially human nouns
are more complicated. It will be necessary to discuss relativization on
the differing participant role types separately.
The basic rule is that the noun which is being relativized is marked
only once, by the final class and number concord suffix. The relativized
noun may be defined as the noun coreferential to the 'head', but obli­
gatorily absent in the relative clause. Thus, in all three examples in414INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-77) the relativized noun is krayv 'frog', the same as the 'head', but
it is obligatorily absent in these relative clauses and only traced by the
concord suffix agreeing with it in number and class. Relative clauses in
which the relativized noun functions as S are the simplest case, so let's
start there. The only agreement suffix permitted on a verb in a relative
clause with the S as the relativized noun is the final concord suffix; the
S cannot be also coded by a pronominal prefix. Consider these:
(7-78) a. namarawt [m-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-come-PERF-3SG
b.*namarawt [m-n-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-3SG S-come-PERF-3SG
'the person who came'
The relativized noun in both of these is the S participant, namarawt
'person'. This is, of course, the same as the head noun, and is marked
by the concord suffix 0. (Human singular nouns and singular nouns of
classes III and V are irregular in that instead of the expected concord
suffix -n, a zero morpheme is found. This is parallel to the usage with
modally inflected verbs.) Example (7-78b) is ungrammatical because
the S is coded twice on the verb, once by the concord suffix and also
by the pronominal agreement prefix n- 3SG S. The latter is completely
prohibited by the blanket rule against double marking of the relativized
noun.
When the relativized noun is an A argument, the resulting structure
is similar to that with relativization on an S. The verb can contain
pronominal agreement prefixes in addition to the obligatory concord
suffix, but these must code an 0 or D participant, never the A. The
morphology for marking a relativized A is identical to that for S.

person is first or second: third person prefixes are prohibited. So (7-80a)
is grammatical, but (7-80b) is not.

'the people who hit me'
[m-pu-tpul-c-um]
b.*namat
person I PL NR DIST-3PL O-hit-PERF-3PL
'the people who hit them'
The reason for this restriction is probably to eliminate ambiguity. Be­
cause the third person pronominal prefixes do not actually distinguish
participant roles as do those of the first and second persons, but vary
in form according to their word position, a form like (7-80b) would be
ambiguous as to whether pu- codes A or 0. In fact, a string like (7-80b)
can only have the meaning where pu- functions as the A.
When the relativized noun is 0, pronominal agreement prefixes of any
person are permitted on the verb to code the A participant. Consider
these examples:
(7-81) a. napntuk [m-kay-JlanaJJ-tmi-aw!Jkcpa-ntuk-ulJ]

'the sago palms which they both were pounding'
Singular human nouns (and nouns of class III and V which behave
morpho- logically like them) have a special concord suffix - nak used
when the relativized noun is in 0 function.
(7-82) a. [Macprak m-n-wu-ntuk-nak]

This is the only concord suffix for relative clauses that actually codes the
participant role of the relativized noun. All others are oblivious to this.","[427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"
"254BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYThe all-purpose third person pronominal in the negative paradigm pu­

Now let us turn t o transitive verbs, those with two participants A
and 0. The basic rule is that the lower of the two participants, i.e.,
the one which in the corresponding positive verb would be the outer
of the two prefixes, is realized by one of the negative number suffixes
above, if human or animate, or by its corresponding possessive/adjectival
concord suffix, if inanimate. The only difference between transitive and
intransitive verbs is that the singular number marker is no longer 0, but
-kak (-ak after a (-peripheral] consonant).
Consider first the following examples with pronominal human par­
ticipants:
(ii) ta-kay-cay-c-ak
(5-102) a. (i) na-kay-cay
3SG 0-1PL A-see
NEG-1PL A-see-PERF-SG
'We saw him.'
'We didn't see him. '
(ii) ta-ka-tay-c-rm

'I didn't see those two.'
'I saw those two.'

d. (i) pu-IJa-tay
NEG-1SG 0-see-PERF-PL
3PL A-1SG O-see
'They didn't see me.'
'They saw me. '
Note that when the suffixed participant is third person, it is not ref­
erenced by the negative pronominal prefix pu-; only the higher ranked
participant is indicated by a pronominal prefix. The pronominal prefix
may reference an A (as in the (a) and (b) examples) or an 0 (as in the
(c) and (d) examples) , but it is always the higher ranked participant
on the person hierarchy discussed in Section 5.1.2. The lower rankedTENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD255prefix is marked only by the negative number suffix. If the lower ranked
participant is inanimate, it will, of course, be referenced for both num­
ber and noun class by the corresponding possessive/adjectival concord
suffix.
(5-103) a. takil]kat ya-kay-wampak-Jlan
rock V PL V PL 0-lPL A-throw-NR PAST
'We threw the rocks yesterday. '
b. takil]kat ta-kay-wampak-jla-ra
rock V PL NEG-lPL A-throw-NR PAST-Y PL
'We didn't throw the rocks yesterday.'
(5-104) a. tpuk
ku-ka-am-wat

'I usually eat sago.'
b. tpuk
ta-ka-am-war-UIJ
sago pancake X SG NEG-lSG A-eat-HAB-X SG
'I don't usually eat sago.'
The participant which appears as the suffix is always the lower ranked
one, i.e., the one which would appear as the outer pronominal prefix in
the corresponding positive verb. Thus, the same rules which determine
the ranking of participants discussed in Section 5.1.2 determine which
participant will be prefixed and which suffixed in the negative verb. So
when both participants are third person, the 0 will always appear as
the suffix.
(5-105) a. (i) na-mpi-tpul

3DL 0-3PL A-hit
NEG-3PL A-hit-PERF-DL
'They hit those two.'
'They didn't hit those two.'
Note that although both participants for these verbs are third person,
there is no pronominal prefix pu- 3. Its occurrence is rather more re­
�tricted in transitive verbs than intransitive, and it is not used when
the following prefix is a pronominal prefix representing a first person
participant, a second person dual participant, a second person plural 0
participant, or a third person non-singular A participant. It is hard to
see how this grouping forms a natural class, but nonetheless, these are
the pronominal prefixes which prohibit a preceding pu- 3. Consider also
the following.","[269, 270, 271]"
"6The Verb Theme and Clause
Structure6.1 Yimas as a Polysynthetic Language
In this chapter and the next I will deal with what might be called the
'syntax' of Yimas. I put this word in quotes because to a very great
extent Yimas lacks the features that we take as diagnostic of syntax in
the more familiar languages of Western Europe. Other than the minimal
noun phrase discussed in Section 4 .6, the syntactic landscape of Yimas
strikes a speaker of a western European language as very alien territory
indeed, presenting very few analogues to the syntactic constituents we
have come to expect.
Like many Amerindian languages, Yimas may be described as poly­
synthetic. Boas ( 1911 , 74) defined this feature as follows: ""a large num­
ber of distinct ideas are amalgamated by grammatical processes and
form a single word, without any morphological distinction between the
formal elements in the sentence and the contents of the sentence."" In
other words, a word (especially a verbal word) in a polysynthetic lan­
!!;Uage corresponds in the range of distinct ideas expressed in it to what
is articulated by a sentence in more familiar languages. To see how this
applies to Yimas, consider the following examples (the square brack­
ds indicate the structural level of verb theme, which will be defined
later) :
( 6- 1) a. ka-mpu-[pay-ma-takat ]-.Jla-mpan-m
LIKE-3PL A-first-in-touch-IMP-3PL D-VII SG T
'Let them first put it (body paint) on them inside.'
b. ya-mpu-[nanaiJ-tacay-ckam]-tuk-mpun
. V PL 0-3PL A-DUR-see(RED: tay-)-show-RM PAST-3PL D
'They were showing those very carefully to them.'
277278THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREc. ta-1Jkl-[mampi-tay-mpi-waraca]-k-nak

e. na-n-[mampi-taJJ-tal-kulanalJ]
3SG 0-3SG A-again-COM-CAUS-walk
'He made him walk with him again. '
All of these examples constitute single words, yet are translated by
sentences in English, in some cases (6-lc,d) by quite complex sen­
tences. That these are single words is clearly supported by a num­
ber of facts. First, these sequences are fully coherent and are not
interruptible. For example, no word or phrase can come between
kwalca-mpi arise-SEQ and kulanav walk in (6- ld) , in spite of the fact
that, from the English point of view these would seem to be sepa­
rate words. Note that in the English translation, the adverb quickly
occurs between these two verbs; this is not possible in the Yimas
form.
Second, the verbal morphology discussed in detail in Chapter 5 ap­
plies to these verbal forms as a whole, not individually. Note that the
tense suffixes in the above forms occur only once, following the last verb
root. Further, the pronominal affixes which mark the core arguments
have scope over the whole complex. Thus, in (6-lb) the 0 and A argu­
ments are indicated by the initial prefixes and the D argument by the
final suffix. In (6-lc) the A argument is marked by the second prefix
vkl- 3PC A (immediately following ta- NEG), and the 0 argument by
the final suffix - nak 3SG. In the corresponding positive sentence, of
course, both the A and the 0 would be indicated by prefixes. Perhaps
the most striking case is the long example in (6-ld). Here the S argu­
ment is expressed by the initial prefix pavkra- lPC S, and its number is
again referenced by the final suffix -vkt PC, eight morphemes away!
Third, the ordering of morphemes within these complexes is rigid.
For example, in ( 6-la,e) any ordering of morphemes other than that
given will result in ungrammatical forms. In a very few cases alternative
orderings are possible, but with no appreciable difference in meaning.

"416INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSAs with the evidence from the modally inflected verbs, the anomaly
of -nak 3SG 0 illustrates a nominative-accusative bias in this part of
Yimas grammar. Note that, when relativized, S and A participants
of these specific class and number features are coded alike, with 0
-n, while 0 participants are treated differently, requiring - nak. The
following examples make this very clear:
(7-83) a. namarawt [m-na-taw-n-0
mnti]
person I SG NR DIST-DEF-sit-PRES-3SG there
'the person who is sitting there'
b. namarawt [narmaJJ

c. namarawt [narmaJJ
m-n-tpul-c-ak]
person I SG woman II SG NR DIST-3SG A-hit-PERF-3SG 0
'the person whom the woman hit'
It is difficult to explain the reason for this form. It cannot be to eliminate
ambiguity, for the obligatory absence of any third person pronominal
prefixes in A relativization versus their presence in 0 relativization is
sufficient to accomplish this. Further this is exactly how disambiguation
is accomplished in the dual and plural which use the same concord suffix
regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun.

Relativization of the T argument of a ditransitive verb is simplest
if the D participant is first or second person and hence marked by a
pronominal prefix. Then, the concord suffix for the relativized T noun
simply follows the tense suffix.

final form.

Relativization of D participants presents a special problem. The
m- NR DIST stem always occupies one of the verbal pronominal pre­
fix positions potentially usurping the position for the prefix for the T
participant. The pronominal affixes for third person D participants are
suffixes following the tense suffix, and this is the position for the con­
cord suffix marking the class and number features of the noun modified
by the relative clause. Both of these present morphological difficulties
for relativization of D participants, and this is generally avoided in the
language. I have never encountered an example in spontaneous usage,
but in elicitation sessions I have been able to get speakers to produce
examples like the following, although given the context in which they
were obtained, it is probable that they are fairly stilted.
(7-87) kalakn [!Jaykum

V PL-3PL A-DEF-give-PRES-3SG D house-OBL
na-na-iray-n
3SG 8-DEF-cry-PRES
'The boy that the women gave food to is crying in the house.'
The relative clause in (7-87) has no unambiguous concord suffix nor m­
NR DIST. The verbal pronominal suffix in this example does double418INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSduty as both the relative clause concord marker and the affix for a third
person singular D participant. The stem m- NR DIST is completely
prohibited because of ya- V PL T. In fact, the modified noun plus the
relative clause looks like a main clause, and (7-87) is ambiguous between
a construction with a relative clause and one consisting of two conjoined
clauses with the meaning 'The women gave the food to the boy in the
house and he is crying.' What, in fact, can discriminate between these
two are word order constraints. If the first clause is simply one of two
conjoined clauses, then kalakn 'boy' can occur anywhere within it, say
between vaykum 'women' and amtra 'food'. If, however, it is the ex­
ternal modified noun of a relative clause, this is not possible. It must
always occur outside of the relative clause, either before it, as in (7-87),
or after it.
Yimas does not restrict relativization to core arguments only. The
language allows relative clauses to be formed by relativizing locationals
(and temporals, as well, but these will be discussed in Section 7.2.3).
When a locational is relativized, the clause describes the place at which
an event occurs, but locative relative clauses contrast with those formed
for core arguments in that they never permit a true head noun, al­
though a locational word or deictic may be present, as following exam­
ples illustrate:

m-mpu-kaprak-war-a-n]
NR DIST-3PL A-cut skin-HAB-IX SG-OBL
'up there where they cut their skin'
The relative clause in the (a) example can only be construed as modify­
ing mnti 'there', but the class-number concord marker on the verb is - a
IX SG. This is the typical class-number marker for referring to places or
areas and may reflect a now lost noun referring to this concept (much
as - mpwi 'talk' and - nti 'act' probably do) . This may be related to
the prefix ta- found on the other locational deictics ta-k 'here' and ta-n
'there' or even more likely to the interrogative stem -vka 'where', both
of which end in -a and on phonological grounds are plausible members
of class IX. In any case, the relative clause is marked as modifying aFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS419class IX singular noun which clearly cannot be the locational deictic.
Rather we must assume some obligatorily missing noun of this class and
number specification which, in turn, is in apposition to the deictic. Sim­
ilar remarks apply to ( 7-88b), with the locational word mawn 'above'.
Sometimes there is not even a deictic or locational word to act as a stand
in head for a locative relative clause; they simply occur on their own as
in (7-89):

Negative finite relative clauses are formed in the same way that
tensed clauses generally are negated, with the verbal prefix ta- NEG
(this obligatorily replaces m- NR DIST). In relative clauses, however,
ta- creates some problems because the morphological effect of negation
on a verb is very much like that of relativization: both require par­
ticipants normally coded by pronominal prefixes to appear as suffixes.
This can result in negative relative clauses being ambiguous (note that
the same result obtains with negation by -kakan 'without' used with
non-finite relative clauses).

'the person that did
not hit the woman.'
The suffix -nak 3SG 0 could be either the result of negation or relative
clause formation. If the latter, it would identify the relativized noun as
in 0 function and thus require the first of the two possible readings. This
is, in fact, the preferred reading. If - nak 3SG 0 derives from negation,
then no conclusions are possible concerning the role of the relativized
noun and the relative clause is therefore compatible with a reading of it
being the A participant (the seeond meaning above). The only way to{}420INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSforce a reading of the A as being the relativized noun is not to code the
0 by a verbal affix at all.

'the person who hit the woman'
Here the bivalent verb tpul- 'hit' is formally intransitive, with just a
single participant coded by pu- . . .-0. The fact that the concord suffix on
the verb is 0 rather than - nak indicates that the relativized noun must
be A. Hence, this example is not ambiguous.
The placement of a relative clause (finite or non-finite) with respect
to its 'head' noun is free. It can precede the 'head' noun,

ative clauses normally function to provide definite descriptions for an en­
tity just being introduced in order to help the hearer identify it. To pro­
vide the definite description but omit the noun to which it applies is prag­
matically very odd and requires quite a marked context to be acceptable.
Example (7-95) belongs in a narrative context discussing crocodiles,
where the entity described by the relative clause is already well es­
tablished. The relative clause then functions contrastively, to select a
particular set of crocodiles out of the class which is already the topic.
The freedom of movement of relative clauses and their very weak
links to their 'head' nouns is fully in keeping with the analysis adopted
here that they are independent nominals in their own right, but appo­
sitionally linked to their head. Unlike other nominals, though, finite rel­
ative clauses are full clauses and partake of the grammatical features of
clauses. As discussed in Section 6.5, Yimas clauses are very loosely struc­
tured, with nominals (core and oblique) occurring in any order with re­
spect to the verb. Structurally, a Yimas clause is flat, with the verb and
nominal clauses all on the same level, as first order branches of S. Rel­
ative clauses have the same basic structure, and are just as free in their
word order possibilities. Thus, (7-96a,b) are both fully grammatical.

Relative clauses can assume any function in the main clause: core
arguments, obliques, or even constituents of possessive NPs. Most com­
monly they are linked to 'head' nouns in these functions and thus assume
the same functions, although the 'heads' can be missing, with the rela­
tive clauses bearing these functions on their own. Examples of relative

Note that in both of these examples, the relative clause follows the non­
finite verb ( it is possible for them to precede ) .
The above facts clearly demonstrate that finite relative clauses have
all the syntactic features and privileges of nouns, including class and
number, but at the same time remain full finite clauses, with tense real­
ized on the verb. They must be analyzed in the most basic terms as an
N realized as a clause. There are two morphological exponents of these
nominal features-m- NR DIST and the final concord suffixes-and so
the question arises as to which of these is the head of the construction,
i.e., that morpheme which actually makes the sentential constituent into
a noun phrase. This would be difficult to decide if it was not for one
small piece of evidence, and that is the concord suffix - nak 3SG 0. This
actually codes the function of the relativized noun, which is a clause­
internal constituent, not that of any constituent in the main clause.
Thus, its behavior is like that of a verbal pronominal affix within the
relative clause. This leaves m- NR. DIST to assume the function of theINTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS424head of the relative clause, and suggests a more formal structure like the
following:
(7-99)NP---- ---N
S
I
/ ""'-.
mX
PRONR DIST--This structure is anomalous in having its head on the left, because Vi­
mas otherwise is a consistent head to the right language. However, this
discrepancy must be faced with the deictics generally; consider the fol­
lowing deictic forms for class I SG:
na-n
m-n
(7-100) na-k
I SG-FR DIST
NR DIST-I SG
I SG-PROX
'that near you'
'that yonder'
'this'
Regardless of whether we choose the concord suffix or the deictic stem
as the head in these forms, at least one form will be anomalous. Sticking
to the majority head to the right pattern of Yimas, we can analyze the
proximal and far deictic forms as consisting of modifier + head, with the
head being the deictic stem. Applying this then to the near distal form,
we identify m- NR DIST as its head. This is unusual because the head
is on the left, but it does independently vindicate the structure (7-100)
suggested for relative clauses.
The stem m- NR DIST is not equivalent to the head noun of an
English relative clause such as the man who killed the crocodile. It is
equivalent rather to the main clause noun to which the relative clause
as a whole is paratactically linked.
Consider the structure of example (7-97a) , which is diagrammed
below in (7-101). Because m- is a form bound to the verb, noun ar­
guments of the relative clause occur before it, represented by the line
branching from the S of the relative clause and crossing over the ver­
tical line from the N of the relative clause. The concord suffix on the
verb of the relative clause marks the class and number (and the par­
ticipant role) of the relativized noun. These features are transferred
to m- NR DIST, much as - m on English who-m identifies that the
relativized noun is an object. Since m- NR DIST is the head of the
noun phrase, these features are also those of the noun phrase as a
whole. These finally are matched up to the features of the noun kaywi
'girl' which is thereby established as the noun modified by the relative
clause.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

These constructions are parallel to the possessor raising constructions
with body parts in that the participant primarily affected by the action
is the animate possessor, coded by the D affix, not the possessed object
coded by the T affix. Further, there is a strong implication that the effect
will be negative (malefactive). This is because in these constructions,
the relationship between the possessor and possessed is terminated by
the action of the verb, with resultant loss or stress on the part of the
possessor. The background context for all the examples above drawn
from texts supports this. The (a) example concerns a scouting party
up in the mountains, with a limited food supply, which was used up by
members of another tribe, resulting in their being hungry. In the (b) ex­
ample, the speaker's basket and its contents of betelnut were taken from
him, so that he was without betelnut. In (c) the example comes from
a traditional legend concerning a village with a magic totemic crocodile
which endowed them with great strength. Here, the speakers plan to
steal it, to get this strength for themselves, but importantly resulting
in the loss of this strength for the present possessors of the crocodile.
Finally, the (d) example has a transparent negative effect on the speaker
and is self-explanatory.
The other side of this construction, in which positive benefits accrue
to the possessor, is the benefactive use of tav- COM. This is actually
j ust the mirror image of the previous usage, but it is disguised at first by
the structure of English and the English translations. In the benefactive
usage, an actor performs an act which results in the establishment of a
possessive relationship between an object and a possessor, with resultant
benefit to the possessor. Consider these examples:

"Note that in all cases the negative differs from the positive in that the S
pronominal prefix form is replaced by the A form, reflecting the under­
lying nominative-accusative case-marking alignment of participants for
first person participants (and second person participants which would
behave identically), discussed in Section 5 . 1 . 1 . In addition, the negative
verb is affixed with a particular suffix which references the number of
the S argument. This set of suffixes is as follows:
SG
0DL
-rmPC
-l]ktPL
-umpThe plural - ump is normally realized as -um, as it generally occurs in
final position and is subject to rule (2-14), final nasal plus stop clus­
ter simplification. After - na NR PAST, the /u/ is deleted so that it is
- mp ""' -m.
The dual suffix is optional with first and second person S arguments;
the others are obligatory. Note the correlation between the dual and plu­
ral of these negative number suffixes and the possessive concord suffixes
for class I (see Section 4 . 1 . 1 ) .

ti- 'become, fell' is normally an intransitive verb, but in (5-71a) it has
two affixes, S and D; kra- 'cut' is a transitive verb, but in (5-71b) it has
three pronominal affixes, S, 0, and D. These D affixes mark fully core
arguments: whatever processes are available to D affixes on ditransitive
verbs are available to these as well, e.g., relativization, anaphoric control
over non-finite modifiers, etc. (see Chapter 7) . By assuming that the
pronominal affixes directly fill the core argument positions of the verb,
this is easily explicable. But otherwise it is not, for the nouns which
these affixes reference are only possessors of other core arguments, the
S in (5-71a) and the 0 in (5-71b). While these may be coded as core
arguments through the verbal prefixes, they may not appear as core
arguments in their own right:

These examples are ungrammatical because these possessors may
not be treated as core (i.e., lacking the oblique suffix) unless linked to
a pronominal affix. The contrast in grammaticality between (5-71) and
(5-72) clearly demonstrates that it is the pronominal affixes which confer
core status and, in fact, fill the argument slots of a verb.
Thus far, I have been discussing referents which are old or established
information and can therefore be indicated by a pronominal affix. What
about new information, characters or props now just being introduced
in the discourse? These can appear with or without a pronominal affix
so that in essence we have the three following structural patterns:
Pattern 1 :
Pattern 2 :
Pattern 3:0
NP
NPPRO-verb
PRO-verb
verbestablished referent
established/new referent
new referentwhere 0 means no overt noun phrase and PRO any pronominal affix.
Pattern 1 has already been illustrated and discussed elsewhere (exam­
ples (5-67a,b) and discussion thereof) , as has pattern 2 for established
referents (examples 5-65a,b) . In considering how new referents are intro-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS233duced, let me consider the unambiguous case, pattern 3, first. Examples
of this follow:
(5-73) a. num-n-mat
Kampramanan wapal-k
village-OBL-PL hill name
climb-IRR
'The villagers climbed Kampramanan. '
paympan
b . m-n
impa-tay-k

'It, the eagle, saw those two.'
pu-nan-JJa-t
c. patn
betelnut V SG 3PL A-2SG D-give-PERF
'They gave you betelnut.'
(5-73a) has an intransitive verb, wapal- 'climb', with no pronominal
affixes; (5-73b) a transitive verb, tay- 'see', with only one pronominal
affix, that of the 0 argument; and ( 5-73c) a ditransitive verb, va- 'give',
with only two pronominal affixes, A and D. In each case, the missing
core argument is provided by an overt noun in the clause: numunmat
'villagers' in (5-72a) , paympan 'eagle' in (5-73b) , and patn 'betelnut' in
(5-73c). These examples all come from running texts in which these
nouns are just being introduced or re-introduced after a longish gap.
They are new information.
Given the earlier claim that the pronominal affixes fill the argument
positions of the verb, an important question is what is the relationship
to the verb of these nouns without coreferent agreement affixes? The
simple answer is just the same, but in this case they are linked to a
zero pronominal affix. In other words, Yimas has much in common
with the feature of uncontrolled 'pronoun drop' in East Asian languages
like Japanese, Thai, and Indonesian. To see how this analysis would
work, consider (5-73b) again. The transitive verb tay- 'see' has two core
arguments, A and 0 (I am here considering the notion of transitivity and
associated arguments to be a straightforward notion in Yimas. This
is not entirely the case, but it is best to postpone the discussion of
this until Section 6.2.1.). This transitive verb only has a single overt
agreement prefix, the prefix impa- 3DL 0, but, as it is a transitive verb,
it must have an A participant. Because of pragmatic reasons, i.e., the
referent of the A is a new participant, this is realized by a zero prefix.
A zero prefix is exactly that, one which has no specifications for class,
person and number and may therefore be linked to any noun which is
morphologically marked as core, i.e. , is not suffixed with the oblique
suffix -n """" - nan. Both noun phrases in (5-73b) meet this requirement,
m-n NR DIST III SG and paympan eagle III SG. But as they have the
Harne noun class and number specifications, they clearly have the same234BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYreferent, which is linked to the zero A prefix and interpreted with the A
role.
Example ( 5-73c) is similar, except that it contains a ditransitive verb
va- 'give' with overt agreement prefixes for A and D, but a zero prefix
for T. The clause contains a morphologically core noun patn 'betelnut'
which is linked to the verb through the zero T prefix and interpreted as
the theme.
Now consider example ( 5-73a) . This sentence contains an intransi­
tive verb, wapal 'climb', with no agreement prefixes and two associated
noun phrases. One of these, numnmat 'villagers', is morphologically a
core argument; the other, Kampramanan 'place name', is morphologi­
cally oblique, with the oblique suffix -n ""' - nan. Hence only numnmat
'villagers' may be linked to the zero S prefix on the verb and interpreted
in the S role.
This last example points up a very important constraint on the gram­
maticality of Yimas clauses which I will call the completeness constraint
(Foley and Van Valin 1984, 183) . It states that a noun may be realized
morphologically as a core argument (i.e., without the oblique suffix - n ""'
- nan) if and only if it is linked to a pronominal affix on the verb (which
may be zero). In other words, a noun without the oblique suffix must
be linked to a pronominal affix and a noun with it never can. The verb
wapal- 'climb' is a good one to illustrate this principle with. Although
basically intransitive, as in (5-73a) , it is actually ambitransitive like its
English equivalent. English climb is intransitive in the child climbed to
the top of the tree but formally transitive in the child climbed the tree.
Yimas behaves identically.

'He climbed up on the coconut palm.'
b. irpm
mu-n-wapal
coconut palm IV SG IV SG 0-3SG A-climb
'He climbed the coconut palm.'
(5-74a) contains wapal- 'climb' used intransitively with a single S prefix.
The noun irpm-un coconut palm IV SG-OBL is not a core argument and
therefore occurs with the oblique suffix. In (5-74b), the verb wapal is
used transitively and has both the A prefix n- 3SG A and the 0 prefix
mu- IV SG 0. Now irpm 'coconut palm' must be realized morpholog­
ically as a core argument and lack the oblique suffix. The use of the
oblique suffix in (5-74b) will result in ungrammaticality.

used to express new referents, let me return briefly to the case of pat­
tern 2 constructions (i.e. , NP PRO-verb), which may also express new
referents. It is important to remember that pattern 2 is potentially
ambiguous; it can also express established referents, as illustrated in
(5-65) . Pattern 2 , (noun phrase plus PRO-verb) commonly has a strong
contrastive component to its meaning. For example, it is generally used
in answer to an information question when the question word functions
as 0 or D.
(5-76) a. Q: nawn ma-tpul
who 2SG S-hit
'Who did you hit?'
b. A: .uaykum
pu-ka-tpul
woman II PL 3PL 0-lSG A-hit
'I hit the women'
Here, vaykum 'women' is the focus of the answer. This is indicated both
by an independent noun and the verbal agreement affix pu- 3PL 0.
In other cases, new referents are introduced through pattern 2 if they
are especially important new props in the development in the discourse
around which its progression turns, as in this example from a traditional
legend:
( 5-77) JlCt
mnta
ya-n-awa-ta-k-nakn
urine V PL and then V PL 0-3SG-excrete-put-IRR-3SG D
'And then she urinated on him.'
Although pet 'urine' is a new participant here, it is an important one,
because by noticing the urine, the man locates his daughter, and the
remaining plot of the story unfolds.
These examples are meant to give the reader a general feel for the
pragmatic, discourse-based differences which determine the choices of
pattern 1, 2 or 3. Because they are pragmatic and discourse-based, it is
impossible to write hard and fast, all-encompassing rules. Rather, there
are devices left open to the speaker to use creatively as he frames the
text. Some of the general principles involved I have discussed here, but
a more complete account will have to remain for a later more detailed
Htudy of Yimas discourse structures. The reader who is especially inter­
eHted is invited to study the texts at the end of this grammar and try
to work out some of these principles himself.
�.2 Tense, Aspect, and Mood
Yimas has a very rich system of tense, aspect, and mood distinctions.
Some aspectual distinctions are expressed through incorporated adver-BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY236bials and compounded verb stems and will be discussed in the relevant
sections in the next chapter (Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2). In this section, I
will only treat the aspect distinctions which are indicated in the suffixal
slots. Mood really corresponds to two separate inflectional categories in
Yimas: modality and illocutionary force. Modality is expressed through
a set of modal prefixes which occur verb-initially, before the pronomi­
nal prefixes, while illocutionary force distinctions such as imperatives or
hortatives are indicated by distinctive inflectional patterns with specific
pronominal affixes.
5.2.1 The Tense/ Aspect System
The only affixal position of a finite verb which is obligatorily occupied is
that of tense. This is a suffixal position following the verb stem(s) and
preceding the paucal and dative suffixes. If these latter are lacking, it
will occur in word final position.
(5-78) a. patn
na-kay-!Ja-ntuk-mpun
betelnut V SG V SG T-1PL A-give-RM PAST-3PL D
'We gave betelnut to them long ago.'
b. tan ipa-wa-ntut
there 1PL S-go-RM PAST
'We went there long ago. '
Note the alternation between the non-final form of the RM PAST tense
suffix, ntuk , and the final form, - ntut. This pattern of alternation be­
tween non-final and final forms is a common feature of the tense suffixes
in Yimas.
The tense/ aspect system of Yimas makes nine distinctions. The pri­
mary distinction is strictly not one of tense, but a modal one. But since
this is realized in the same suffixal slot as all the other tense distinctions,
it will be treated as part of the same paradigmatic system here. Thus,
the basic distinction in the Yimas tense/aspect system is between unreal
and real events. Unreal events are marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' - T)k,
which indicates that the event so marked is outside the continuum of real
time, e.g. , in the legendary past or in the indefinite future (see Section
5.2.1.1). Real events must be marked by one of the other tense/aspect
suffixes. These express an eight way contrast. Yimas has two basic past
tenses: a near past, for events which occurred yesterday; and a remote
past, for events which occurred any time since the legendary past up
to about five days ago. In addition there is a far past, composed of
the remote past suffix plus the suffix -kia, discussed in Section 5.2.1.2,
which is used for events occurring from two days ago to five days ago,
although the boundary between this and the remote past is flexible, and
-TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD237a switch from the remote past to the far past is often used for nuances
of vividness in narratives. The present tense is used to express events
which occurred today, but is divided according to aspectual contrasts.
There is a three-way aspectual contrast for present tense: perfective, for
events which are completed; imperfective, for events which are ongoing;
and habitual, for events which recur regularly according to the normal
expectations of life patterns in the community. Finally, there are two
future tenses: a remote future, for events which are fully expected to
occur the day after tomorrow or later; and a near future, for events
expected to occur tomorrow. The contrasts in the Yimas tense-aspect
system may be summarized in the following schema:

The irrealis suffix is used in Yimas to indicate events which are located
outside of the continuum of real time: they must be completely timeless,
in the legendary past or in the indefinite future. In other words, it marks
events whose temporal coordinates cannot clearly be fixed by the speaker
in what he regards as experiential time. Because the irrealis occurs at
both ends of the temporal continuum, it may be conjectured that Yimas
speakers view time not as an open infinitely expandable line, but as a
closed circle.
UNREAL TIME
IRR
PRESENT
REAL TIME
This is a tempting speculation, but there is no evidence at present, other
t han the distribution of the irrealis suffix to affirm or deny it.
The use of the irrealis to express timeless events is prototypically
indicated by its use with the copula. If the reader will glance back at
the forms of the copula in Section 5.1.5, he will note that all forms
l.!�rminate in the irrealis -k. The copula is used in statements which hold238BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYtrue generally and are not bound to particular periods of time. In fact
the use of any other tense/aspect/mood inflection with the copula is
ungrammatical.
The irrealis suffix is probably most commonly found in traditional
legends, where it is almost invariably used, although the remote past
would also be an option. Consider the following:
(5-79) a. tan impa-ampu-mpi-awl-k
there 3DL S-float-SEQ-take-IRR
'They both drifted there.'
b. impa-mpu-yakal-irm-tay-Jlcut
3DL 0-3PL A-CONT-stand-see-RM PAST
'They stood watching them both.'
These two examples come from the same text and are separated only by
a single sentence. Both take place in exactly the same time period, the
legendary past, yet one is marked with the irrealis and the other with
the remote past suffix. In terms of absolute time reference, there is no
difference in this text between the irrealis and the remote past. But the
use of the remote past implies that events occurred in the stream of real,
albeit remote, time, while the irrealis removes them from the continuum
of real time altogether and situates them in the period before real time
as apprehended by men began. The use of the remote past in such
traditional legends is actually rather less common. In the text from
which the sentences in (5-79) were drawn, that of the creation myth,
less than 20% of all sentences in the legendary past are inflected with
the remote past suffix, the rest occur with the irrealis. Quite commonly,
a speaker will start a legend with the remote past suffix, but by the
third or fourth sentence will switch to the irrealis and remain with that
through the rest of the text. Also, it is sometimes the case that a speaker
will switch from the irrealis to the remote past in the denouement of a
text: this provides a vivid or immediate coloring to the events described.
The irrealis may also mark as yet unrealized future events. In this
case, it contrasts with the remote future tense. Consider these examples:
(5-80) a. ama patn
wayk-k
lSG betelnut V SG buy-IRR
'I want to/will buy betelnut.'
b. patn
na-ka-wayk-kt
betelnut V SG V SG 0-lSG A-buy-RM FUT
'I will buy betelnut after tomorrow.'
The remote future suffix -kt , as in (5-80b) , commits the speaker to the
belief that the event described will definitely or at least is highly likely
to occur in the future. The irrealis suffix requires no such commitment.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"

On the other hand, a third person S argument of a negative verb is
realized in the same way as a third person 0, and quite differently from
an A argument, i.e. , an ergative-absolutive marking pattern.

The third plural S and 0 are both expressed through the morpheme com­
bination pu- . . . -um 3-. . .-PL, while the A appears as the typical ergative
prefix mpu- 3 PL A. Thus, the negative verbs exhibit the typical split
for person we have seen elsewhere in the verbal morphology, nominative­
accusative for first and second persons and ergative-absolutive for third.
But this ergative-absolutive patterning for third person breaks down
in the third singular forms of negative verbs. If one surveys the previous
forms, one will discover that a third singular A is always coded by a 0
number suffix, but an 0 by - nak (compare, for example, (5-106a(i)) with
(5-106c(i)). Additional examples are offered below:

will be written as nawkwan and kawkawpwi, respectively. This seems
necessary because R spreading in these cases produces a segment w
rather than just rounding the vowel. Finally, initial w as a result of
initial semivowel formation (2-10) will also be orthographically repre­
sented; thus jut/ 'night' becomes orthographic wut. This will not be
done with initial y resulting from the same rule. This difference in or­
thographic convention reflects the more common pronunciation.
Consonants contrast with vowels in the orthography in that their
writing conventions approach their surface phonetic realizations more
closely. This was already mentioned with the case of final stops following
nasals. Any underlying consonant which undergoes a phonological rule
of Section 2.3, such as palatalization (2-3) or liquid strengthening (2-4, 25), will be written as the derived segment, not the underlying one. Thus
jtaJ]kway + takal + k/ 'look after' will be written as tal]kwaycakalk
(palatalization) , fapur/ 'green skink' as aput (final liquid strengthen­
ing) , and /tal + na + k/ 'hold it' as tatJlak (palatalization plus prenasal
liquid strengthening).
�---3Word C lassesYimas has only two major, open classes of words, nouns and verbs; all
other classes are small and closed. The inventory of the closed classes is
the following:
pronouns
deictics
conjunctions
interjectionsadjectives
quantifiers
locationals
temporalsWe can distinguish these word classes by a variety of criteria; both se­
mantic and formal. Often the semantic content of a word class will
determine its range of morphological possibilities. For example, nouns
commonly denote objects. Hence number, the morphological category
for the expression of multiple tokens of an object, and case, the category
which indicates the role an object plays in a given event, are general
inflectional possibilities for nouns. Verbs, on the other hand, denote
states or events. A common morphological category for them is tense,
which expresses the time at which the event occurs. But not all inflec­
tional categories can be explained so straightforwardly: Yimas verbs are
assigned to just one word class, but the language has a rich system of
derivational morphology by which verbs are derived into nouns and ad­
jectives. Adjectives in turn may be derived into adverbs and verbs. No
other parts of speech are derivable. Some choices are just an arbitrary
feature of a particular language. For example, in Yimas number is an in­
flectional category of verbs as well as nouns. Consequently, word classes
cannot be defined in terms of semantic content alone, but we must use
in their definitions a combination of semantic content, morphological
possibilities, and syntactic behavior. This is the procedure that I will
follow in defining each of the Yimas word classes in the sections that
follow.
8!190WORD CLASSES3.1 Nouns
Nouns are the word class which provides an inventory of the objects
of interest in the world (or imagination) of the speakers of a language.
Nouns are employed in discourse to introduce props, entities, and partic­
ipants relevant to the progression of the discourse. They accomplish this
because by the conventions of the language they are symbols associated
with their referents, the real world or imaginary objects which are called
into mind when the noun is uttered in discourse.
The natural world, as well as the human creations of the social and
cultural worlds, presents a vast array of entities which may be con­
ventionally expressed by nouns. Each language group, according to its
interests, its ecological niche, its social and cultural forms, selects from
this range and codes a subset of it in its system of nouns. However, the
system of nouns is still always large and is invariably the largest word
class in a language. This is undoubtedly true of Yimas, in which the set
of nouns is much larger than the next largest word class, verbs.
Because nouns are typically employed in discourse to introduce or
mention props or participants, they are associated with syntactic func­
tions which describe these participants or express their roles. Nouns fill
the functions of grammatical relations such as subject and object and are
associated with the category of case, which expresses the syntactic roles
of participants. For example, Yimas has a single case marker, an oblique
case suffix - n ""' - nan, which indicates locations, times or instruments
(see Section 4.2). This is a common inflection for noun stems:
(3-1) nam-n
tmat-jlan
wanwa-n
rna
house-OBL
other sun-OBL
knife-OBL
'with a knife'
'on another day'
'in the house'
Nouns also function as the subject and object of a verb. Nouns in
these functions are not inflected for case, but do agree in person and
number with the verb. Their agreement is indicated by a set of verb
prefixes (0 indicates the object of a transitive verb and A, its subject;
see Section 5.1.1).
(3-2) a. narmau namat pu-n-tu-t
woman men
3PL 0-3SG A-kill-PERF
'The woman killed the men.'
b. narmau namat na-mpu-tu-t
woman men
3SG 0-3PL A-kill-PERF
'The men killed the woman.'
The word order of the nouns in Yimas is free, so order does not sig­
nal their syntactic functions as it does in English (compare the English
translations of the above examples). Rather this is indicated by the pre-91NOUNSfixes t o the verb. The sequence o f prefixes in (3-2a) pu-n- indicates a
singular subject and a plural object, so the plural noun in the sentence
namat 'men' is the subject, and the singular noun narmav 'woman' is
the object. The opposite situation obtains in (3-2b) where the prefix
sequence na-mpu- indicates a singular object and a plural subject.
The morphology of nouns will be treated in greater detail in Chapter
4, so I will only mention here some basic morphological defining char­
acteristics. All nouns except for proper names are inflected for three
numbers-singular, dual and plural-and are assigned to a single noun
class. It is this last feature which distinguishes nouns from adjectives
or deictics. Adjectives and deictics vary over the whole range of noun
classes, co-occurring with all possible number/class suffixes. Nouns dif­
fer in being uniquely assigned to a class and taking the number/ class
suffixes specific to that class. Contrast the adjective ma 'other', occur­
ring with a number of different number/class suffixes, with the class VI
noun kav 'shell':

many common nouns have suppletive forms to mark number, i.e., the
singular and plural forms have different stems (in all these cases the dual
form is derived regularly from the singular stem) . This generally applies
to nouns referring to human beings, some animals and other important
objects. Consider the following small sample:
'woman'
'man'
'child'
'mother'
'bird'

two possible inflections, the number/class markers and the oblique case
suffix -n ,...., - nan . The morphology of nouns is exclusively suffixal, while
that of verbs is both prefixal and suffixal. Nouns are inherently assigned
to a given class and are marked for number by a set of number suffixes
which vary for class.

yakiaura-3.2 Verbs
Verbs contrast with nouns in that they are the word class which denote
events or states. While objects, especially those in the natural world,
exist in their own right, this is not true of events or states. These only
manifest themselves by virtue of some object or objects undergoing or
performing them. The set of verbs in a language may be viewed as a
script outlining the various modes in which objects denoted by the set
of nouns may interact.
Because verbs function as the script of a language, it is they which
lay out the basic plot of a discourse. Verbs prototypically fill the syntac­
tic/semantic function of the predicate of the clause, which denotes theADJECTIVES93nature of the state or event participated in by a set of objects referred
to by the nouns in the clause. Thus, the verb hit functioning in John hit
Peter tells us the manner in which John and Peter interacted. Verbs like
hit indicating a transaction between two or more objects are transitive.
Other verbs function as predicates denoting an event or state performed
or undergone by some object; these are intransitive verbs, and exam­
ples are run as in John ran in the race, or sleep as in John slept in the
barn.
The morphology of verbs will be treated in detail in Chapters 5 and
6, so I will only discuss some basic defining features here. The morpho­
logical feature most characteristic of verbs, and the only obligatory one,
is tense. All finite verbs must be inflected for tense, and non-finite verbs
must have a suffix -ru in the normal inflectional position for tense. No
other part of speech is ever inflected for tense, so it can be regarded as
a necessary and sufficient condition on the word class verb.
A second defining characteristic of verbs is that only they can occur
with the modal prefixes, such as ta- NEG, ant- POT and ka- LIKELY.
These are not necessary inflections on a verb, as most verbs are un­
marked for modality. But the potential occurrence of one of these pre­
fixes on a word always identifies it as a verb, for no other word class is
inflectable for modality.
A third morphological characteristic of verbs is the presence of pre­
fixes to indicate the person, number, and noun class of core nominal ar­
guments, i.e., subject, object, and indirect object. I have already pointed
out how nouns are uniquely assigned to noun classes and inflected for
number by suffixes, varying allomorphically according to noun class.
Verbs parallel this variation for noun class and number by indicating
these features for the nouns functioning as their core arguments, but do
so by means of prefixes. Examples of such verbal prefixes corresponding
to the noun suffixes were presented at the end of Section 3.2.
3.3 Adjectives
Adjectives are the word class that expresses a state, quality, or defining
characteristic of some object. As such, they most commonly function
syntactically as the modifier of some noun in a noun phrase. Some
languages seem to have no word class of adjectives at a.ll, assigning all
words denoting states or qualities of objects to the word classes verb or
noun (Dixon 1977). Other languages have a very small and restricted
class of adjectives. Yimas is one of these. There are only three true
unambiguous examples of adjectives in the language. They are kpa 'big',
yua 'good', and ma 'other'. These are distinguished from other Yimas
words denoting qualities of objects in that they are uninflected for the94WORO CLASSESverbal category tense and may occur with a following noun in a tightly
knit noun phrase (see Section 4.6).
(3-3) a. kpa nam
b. * nam kpa
house big
big house
'a big house'
No other word can occur between the adjective and the head noun. If this
should occur, the adjective must then be suffixed with a number class
suffix agreeing in these features with the modified noun. Its position is
now free and can occur on either side of the noun.
(3-4) a. kpa-nm
nam
big-house SG house
'a big house'
b. nam kpa-nm
house big-house SG
'a big house'
In fact, the inflected adjective need not even adjoin the noun, but may
occur anywhere in the clause.
(3-5) ama-na
nam
lSG-POSS house SG
ant-ka-na-war-kiant-nm
kpa-nm
POT-lSG A-DEF-build-NR FUT-house SG big-house SG
'Tomorrow I will be able to build my big house.'
Other words denoting qualities are morphologically verbs. These
occur with the suffix -k, the tense suffix for irrealis (IRR) . This suffix
is normally used to remove the action denoted by the verb from the
continuum in real time and thus mark it as timeless. It is therefore
used for events in the legendary past, unrealized events in the future
whose time of occurrence cannot be fixed, and states whose duration
cannot be bound (see Section 5.2. 1 . 1 ) . It is this last meaning which
accounts for its use with words denoting qualities. These adjectival-like
verbs suffixed with - k also require a number/class suffix, agreeing in
these features with a modified noun. As such they may occur on either
side of the noun, or may not even adjoin it. These tensed adjectival
verbs never occur in the construction characteristic of true adjectives,
i.e., immediately preceding the head noun in a close-knit noun phrase
without the number/ class suffixes. Examples of these adjectival verbs
follow:
(3-6) a. apak tukut-k-nmau
sister heavy-IRR-11 SG
'a fat sister'ADJECTIVES95b. urkpwica-k-n
numpran
black-IRR-III SG pig III SG
'a black pig'
*
c. urkpwica numpran
black
pig III SG
The adjectival verbs comprise the largest class of words denoting qual­
ities in Yimas. Besides the first stems already illustrated, we have the
following non-exhaustive list:
'white'
'long'
'short'
'hard/strong'
'light'
'new'
'straight'yarackaw!Jkraparmpakalcwal]lakantmakrat!Jk-'sharp'
'whole'
'hollow'
'stubborn'
'empty, clear'
'dry'wapimuntaurmpwi­
ara!Jalca­
kamtakacJlaA further indication that these so-called adjectival verbs are really
verbs shows up in the formation of inchoatives, expressing changes of
state. The adjectival verbs can do this directly, by changing the tense
inflection to one within the real temporal continuum, and changing the
number/ class suffixes to the more typically verbal number/class prefixes
(S indicates the subject of an intransitive verb).
(3-7) a. na-t!Jknt-t
II SG S-become heavy-PERF
'She got fat.'
p-urkpwica-t
b. narm
skin VII SG VII SG S-blacken-PERF
' (My) skin darkened.'
The examples in (3-7) clearly indicate that these stems in their basic
meaning are process verbs; they only assume the stative meaning by
virtue by the IRR suffix -k, which stipulates that the event is unbounded
in time.
The true adjectives may not form inchoatives in this fashion. Rather
they must occur with the verb ti- 'do, become, feel', which carries the
tense suffix. The adjective may occur as a separate word or may be
incorporated into the verb, but in both cases it must co-occur with the
proper number/class suffix for the subject of the verb.

=6.5 Yimas Clause StructuresYimas clauses present a stark contrast to the highly structured and hier­
archically ordered pattern of its verbal morphology. Yimas clauses have
very little structure and certainly none that could be called hierarchical,
analogous to the levels of Vo , V 1 , V2 , and V in the verb. Yimas is an
excellent exemplar of a non-configurational language at the clausal level
(Chomsky 1981; Hale 1983): word order is free and clausal constituents
largely correspond to the word. Let me examine these claims in more
detail.
The only obligatory constituent of a clause in Yimas is a verb. In fact,
the great majority of clauses consist of just a verb. If other constituents
are present, they are arranged loosely around the verb, in no obligatory
order, although locationals and temporals tend to be located at the
clause periphery. Thus, in addition to examples like (6-184a,b) with
verb-final word order, the language also possesses the fully acceptable
variants in (6-184c,d).

A clause with both norninals following the verb (i.e., a verb-initial struc-370THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREture ) is perfectly grammatical, but is a bit more marked pragmatically
than the above examples.

kay
VIII SG 0-lSG A-push-SEQ-put down canoe VIII SGmarmp-n
river VII SG-OBL
'I pushed the canoe into the river.'
Examples ( 6-184a,b ) correspond to what may be called the unmarked
word order, i.e., with the verb last. A verb is associated in Yimas with a
falling intonation contour at its end, which in ( 6-184a,b) also functions
to mark the end of the clauses. This falling verbal intonation contour
also occurs in ( 6-184c,d) , but in these cases, another separate falling in­
tonation pattern occurs on the final constituents. This falling intonation
pattern is no more prominent on core arguments ( 6-184c ) than oblique
constituents ( 6-184d) . It may be that these final nominal constituents
correspond to a kind of afterthought phenomenon, as indicated by the
separate intonation contour, but these must not be equated with af­
terthought constructions in English. Yimas clauses like ( 6-184c,d) have
none of the marked pragmatic force of afterthought constructions in
English: postverbal constituents in Yimas are slightly more contrastive
than preverbal ones and thus ( 6-184c,d) are somewhat more marked
than ( 6-184a,b) , but this difference is nowhere near as emphatic as that
between John went to Berlin last weekend and He went to Berlin last
weekend, John did. It is also important to note that in examples like
( 6-184a,b ) , the core argument kay 'canoe' is already rather contrastive
in that it is encoded both as an independent noun and as a pronominal
i- VIII SG 0. The most neutral version of ( 6-184a) with no contrastive
reading at all on kay 'canoe' would lack the independent noun alto­
gether ( see Section 5.1.5 ) . It should be pointed out that afterthought
constructions with a core argument such as ( 6-184d) commonly code
the argument simultaneously with a pronominal affix. This suggests
that what is happening pragmatically in these cases is that the speaker
first codes the argument as an established referent with a pronominal
affix, but having done so, then decides that this coding is insufficient
either because there are multiple potential referents for that affix, or
because the referent is too far removed in the discourse, or because it
is simply not emphatic enough. He then repeats the full constituent
preverbally, producing an afterthought construction like ( 6-184d) . The
potential weakness in this argument is that afterthought constructions
with core arguments ( 6-184d ) are not more marked phonologically orYIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES371frequency-wise than those with oblique nominals (6-184c), for which no
verbal coding with a pronominal affix is available. This further suggests
that these afterthought constructions in Yimas are not highly marked
pragmatically, but represent weakly contrastive variants from the un­
marked versions.
The same comments apply to examples with more than one overt
core argument, as shown below:
(6-186) a. panmal kay
i-n-yamal
man I SG canoe VIII SG VIII SG 0-3SG A-carve

'The man made a canoe.'
If one asks a Yimas speaker to translate 'the man made a canoe', one
is most likely to get (6-186a) as the equivalent (with (6-186b) a close
second). In this sense one could claim the word order of (6-186a), i.e.,
actor-object verb ( S OV), as the unmarked word order of Yimas. How­
ever, this claim is actually a chimera of elicitation, for in actual Yimas
discourse, examples like (6-186a) are quite rare. This is due largely to
the fact that clauses with two overt nominals functioning as core ar­
guments are very uncommon in Yimas, a highly marked structure; but
even when this does occur, it is by no means the case that a structure
like ( 6-186a) is statistically more frequent than ( 6-186b), or, for that
matter, (6-186c) or (6-186d). In this sense, the notion of unmarked
word order in Yimas corresponds more to an idealization of the linguist
than anything actually in the grammatical patterns of the speakers of
the language. Thus, both (6-186a) and (6-186b) can fairly be taken as
being roughly equivalent as to unmarked realizations of 'the man made
a canoe', with the proviso that both structures are in actuality highly
marked for having two overt nouns as core arguments.
Given the fact that the base structures (6-186a,b) are already quite
marked, it should come as no surprise that the afterthought construc­
tions (6-186c,d) are not much more so. In fact, constructions like
(6-184d), in which the noun functioning as the A participant of a transi­
tive occurs as an afterthought constituent, are probably the most com-372THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmon of all afterthought constructions, and statistically would be more
common in Yimas texts than constructions like ( 6-186a,b). Sentences
like (6-186d) occur commonly in texts when the actions jump back and
forth sequentially between two or more central A participants. Often
when the A participant changes, the speaker first encodes the new A
with an overt deictic or just a pronominal affix or both, but he then
decides that this marking was insufficient and thus additionally express
it as an afterthought noun. Example (6-186e), like (6-184) earlier, is the
most marked of these alternatives, because it is difficult to imagine a
context in which it would be appropriate, given the pragmatic force of
contrastiveness associated with afterthought nominals.
Yimas clauses are normally just a string of words. (Phrasal con­
stituents are relatively rare in Yimas and will be discussed below.) Other
than the verb, the words usually belong to the class of nominals and there
may be more of them than allowed by the valence of the verb, as in this
example:
(6-187) a!Jkayapan patn
ama-na-kn
mama-k-n
afternoon betelnut V SG 1SG-POSS-V SG bad-IRR-V SG
kalakn na-n-kpuc-t
nam-n
boy I SG V SG 0-3SG A-chew-PERF house-OBL
'In the afternoon, the boy chewed my rotten betelnut in the
house.'
This verb contains a bivalent verb root kpuc- 'chew' which functions
formally as a transitive verb with two pronominal affixes, na- V SG 0
and n- 3SG A. Associated in the same clause are a temporal avkayapan
'afternoon' and five nominals, one oblique nam-n house-OBL 'in the
house' and the rest core, kalakn 'boy', patn 'betelnut', ama-na-kn 1SG­
POSS-V SG 'mine' and mama-k-n bad-IRR-V SG 'bad'. The four core
nominals must be linked to the two core argument slots of the verb for
this sentence to be grammatical (by the completeness constraint; see
Section 5.1.5).
A sentence like (6-187) is generated around the verb; all other con­
stituents are paratactically linked to it. The verb emerges from the
lexical and morphological derivational rules of the previous section fully
formed. It is a transitive verb, with two core arguments, one specified
as class V SG and the other as third person singular.
na - n -kpuc-t[sg] - [s�]-chew-[PERF]YIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES373The pronominal prefixes can now be linked to nominals with the same
specifications. The feature cluster
is easily matched to kalakn 'boy' which is third singular and, being ani­
mate, is the only possible noun that could be linked to the n- pronominal
prefix. The other prefix with the feature cluster[sg]has three possible nominals that may be linked to it: patn 'betelnut',
ama-na-kn 1SG-POSS-V SG 'mine', and mama-k-n bad-IRR-V SG 'bad'.
Because all of these are direct nominals, i.e., neither affixed with - n ""'
-nan OBL nor in a postpositional phrase, they must all be linked to this
one pronominal affix, or by the completeness constraint, the sentence
will be ungrammatical. This linkage is possible because all of them have
the same feature specifications as the pronominal prefix.
The nominals ama-na-kn 1SG-POSS-V SG 'mine' and mama-k-n bad­
IRR-V SG bear a similar kind of loose paratactic relationship to the
noun patn 'betelnut' (in this case, commonly termed apposition) that
patn 'betelnut' and kalakn 'child' bear to the pronominal prefixes. Fi­
nally, the oblique nominal nam-n house-OBL 'in the house', functioning
as a locational, and the temporal avkayapan 'afternoon' can be freely
added, for not being direct nominals, they need not be linked to the
verb. Such oblique and peripheral constituents modify the clause as a
whole. The structure of (6-187) can be diagrammatically represented as
shown below:

"334THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREIt is important to note that although these two verbs have specialized
meanings in serial verb constructions, such readings are not obligatory.
Although they, of course, must have their literal meanings after -mpi
SEQ (6-110a) , this is also possible if they are joined simply by juxtapo­
sition (6-1 10b) .
(6- 110) a. na-mpu-wampaki-mpi-tay-k

'They threw it and watched it.'
b. impa-mpu-yakal-irm-tay-JlCUt
3DL 0-3PL A-CONT-stand-see-RM PAST
'They were standing up and watching those two.'
6.3.1.2 Specializations in Serial Verb Constructions:
ti- 'do, feel, become'
The verb root ti- 'do, feel, become' is used in serial verb constructions
in two specialized ways. In both these uses, it occurs as the first verb
in the serial structure and is only linked to the following verb by simple
juxtaposition. In the first of these uses, ti- 'do, feel, become' is always
employed in combination with the verbal prefix tia- 'act, deed' (or its
suffixal variant - nti) to emphasize that an action is accomplished to a
greater extent than is usually expected. This is most common with verbs
of motion, as these examples illustrate:
(6-111) a. tia-n-t-arm-mpi-wa-k
act 0-3SG A-do-board-SEQ-go-IRR
'He boarded (the canoe) and went for good.'
b. tia-kay-c-arpal-kiantu-JJkt
act 0-lPL A-do-exit-FR PAST-PC
'Those few came outside completely.'
c. tia-n-taJJ-ti-wa-kia-ntuk-nakn
act 0-3SG A-COM-do-go-NIGHT-RM PAST-3SG 0
'He went with her for good.'
Notice that, in some ways, ti- 'do, feel, become' functions in these exam­
ples as a valence increaser, to derive bivalent verb themes from mono­
valent verb roots of motion. It is treated here as a specialized use of
a serial verb construction rather than as a valence increasing prefix be­
cause it is completely restricted to a single introduced participant, coded
by the agreement prefix tia- 'act'. As this prefix is transparently related
to the semantics of the verb root ti- 'do, become, feel', it seems on bal­
ance more justified to treat this construction as a specialized serial verb
construction, although, I do admit, the boundary between specialized
serial verb constructions and, say, constructions with pampay- KIN isTHEME DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES335not a sharp one. The last example above (6-111c) is an interesting one.
Although the core lexical verb root wa- 'go' is monovalent, the whole
verbal construction is formally ditransitive. This is because serialization
with ti- 'do' derives a bivalent verb theme and requires the presence of
tia- 'act'. This in turn is derived into a trivalent verb theme by tav­
COM, which licenses the appearance of - nakn 3SG D.
Related to this first specialized use of ti- 'do, feel, become' is the
second one involving the interrogative adverbial waratnti 'how, in what
way' . Consider first the following example:
(6-112) takmpi tia-kay-JlanaJJ-ti-ntut
like this act 0-lPL A-DUR-do-RM PAST
'We used to do it like this.'
Since ti- 'do, feel, become' is a bivalent verb in this usage, it is associated
with two pronominal affixes: kay- lPL A and, filling the 0 slot, tia- 'act',
so (6-112) literally means 'we used to do the act like this' The interrog­
ative waratnti adverb contains the suffixal equivalent of tia- 'act' which
is -nti . When this interrogative word is used in a clause, it typically is
linked to the verb ti- 'do, feel, become', joined by juxtaposition as the
first member of a serial verb construction. The adverb waratnti 'how'
is formally a noun (it has the nominal concord suffix - nti 'act'), and is
regarded as a core argument (note that it has no oblique suffix). Just as
ti- 'do, feel, become' requires tia- 'act' in (6-111), it sanctions waratnti
in the examples below:
(6-113) a. waratnti tia-kay-JlanaJJ-ti-kra-ntut
how
act 0-lPL A-DUR-do-cut-RM PAST
'How did we used to cut (it)?'
b. waratnti anta-ti-kra-kia-na-IJ?
how
HORT SG-do-cut-NIGHT-IMP-V SG
'How will I cut this?'
c. waratnti pia-mpu-ti-ant-kia-kt?
how

'How will they understand?'
d. waratnti

ya-ka-na-ti-1-awt-mpi-kawra-kia-k?
V PL 0-lSG A-DEF-do-down-get-SEQ-stub-NR FUT-IRR
'How am I getting (these) and stubbing (toes)?'
Although formally all the verbs in (6- 113) are transitive, matching
the bivalent specifications of their verb stems, they are actually trivalent,
for the third core argument is waratnti 'how'. This is possible because336THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREof the use of ti- 'do, feel, become' in all the above examples, which links
to waratnti 'how' in much the same way as it did to tia- in (6-112). This
is transparently the case in (6-113a) in which the prefix tia- is overtly
present and appositionally linked to waratnti.
6.3.2 Adverbial Incorporation
A second common process of derivation in Yimas which derives verb
themes from verb stems is adverbial incorporation. Yimas possesses
two types of adverbials: those which are base adverbials and can only
appear incorporated as part of the verb theme and those which are
derived from other word classes, notably adjectives and adverbs, and
normally can appear either as incorporated elements or as independent
words. As an example of the first type, consider pay- ' (at) first, right
now'. A sentence in which it appears as an incorporated element of the
verb theme (6-114a) is grammatical, but one in which it appears as an
independent word (6-114b) is not.
(6-114) a. na-mpu-pay-kulanaJJ-tay-Jlcut
V SG 0-3PL A-first-walk-see-RM PAST
'They walked around and looked at it first. '
b. * pay na-mpu-kulanalJ-tay-JlCut
first V SG 0-3PL A-walk-see-RM PAST
But mampi 'again' is a member of the second class. It is derived from the
adjective root ma- 'other' plus the adverb derivational suffix - mpi and
can appear either as incorporated element (6-115a) or as an independent
word (6-115b).
(6-115) a. na-n-mampi-ira-wampulJkra-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-again-ALL-angry-RM PAST
'He was angry with her again. '
b . mampi na-n-ira-wampu1Jkra-ntut
again 3SG 0-3SG A-ALL-angry-RM PAST
'He was angry with her again. '
Obligatorily incorporated adverbials commonly, but not exclusively, ex­
press aspectual or temporal notions, while optionally incorporated ad­
verbials denote the manner in or degree to which an action is carried
out. I will first take up the discussion of the former.
6.3.2.1 Obligatorily Incorporated Adverbials
6.3.2.1.1 Continuative yakal-. This morpheme and the next one to be
discussed are the most common of incorporated adverbials. The con­
tinuative yakal- (sometimes contracted to kal-) expresses that an action
or event continues uninterrupted over an extended period and is trans­
latable by the Tok Pisin usage i wok long. It is commonly found inTHEME DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES337combination with verbs denoting actions. It may only be used in past
and future tenses; in the present, its function is usurped by na- DEF +
-nt PRES.
Examples of yakal- follow:
(6-116) a. impa-yakal-cmi-kiantut
3DL S-CONT-say-FR PAST
'Those two were talking. '
b. na-mpi-yakal-ca-mpi-yampara-pu-k
V SG 0-3DL A-CONT-put up-SEQ-erect-away-IRR
'Those two were putting it up and erecting it while going.'
c. pu-n-yakal-calJkway-cantaw-malak-ntut
3PL 0-3SG A-CONT-VIS-sit(RED: taw-)-converse-RM PAST
tak
here
'He was sitting here, talking with them to their faces. '
The position of incorporated adverbials is fixed. The obligatory incor­
poration of adverbials always occurs at the level of the verb theme and,
thus, follows the derivation of a complex verb theme through verb seri­
alization (6-116b) or valence altering (6-1 15c) . Any other order of the
morphemes in (6-1 16b,c) is ungrammatical.
6.3.2.1.2 Durative nanav-. This morpheme expresses an event or, more
commonly, a state which endures over an uninterrupted span of time.
In contrast to yakal- CONT, nanav- DUR is more commonly associated
with verbs denoting states or conditions, and is typically translated by
the Tok Pisin preverbal particle se HAB. Verbs marked by nanav- DUR
are typically viewed as extending over a longer period of time than those
with yakal- CONT, hence the correlation of nanav- with the Tok Pisin
habitual particle. It is transparently related to the verb nav- 'live, stay'
by partial reduplication, but the meaning is now quite divergent, and
it must be regarded as a separate morpheme. A relationship between
stance verbs like 'stay' or 'sit' and a durativefprogressive morpheme is
a common feature of Papuan languages (Foley 1986) . The adverbial
nanav- DUR is also commonly found in combination with the aspectual
suffix -na( v) DUR (see Section 5.2.1.6.2) .
Examples of nanav DUR are:
na-nanalJ-yamat-jla-ntut

The other basic mood categories in Yimas, imperatives and hortatives
are morphologically indicated by a verbal suffix.
5.2.3.1 Imperative Mood
Verbs in imperative mood are always associated with S or A arguments
which are second person (semantically they are agents). The impera­
tive mood always expresses a command which the speaker expects the
addressee will carry out. The diagnostic inflections for imperatives are
the imperative/hortative suffix - n (word-final position) alternating with
""' -na (elsewhere) , plus one of a set of pronominal prefixes which marks
the number of the addressee. If the addressee is singular, it is marked
by 0.( 5-141) a. mi tak wi-JJka-pra-n
2SG here up-go by land-toward-IMP
'You come up here!'
b. mi JJa-tput-mpa-n
2SG lSG 0-hit-IMM-IMP
'You hit me now!'
If the addressee is dual, the prefix is navk-.
(5- 142) a. kapwa tak naJJk-wi-JJka-pra-n
2DL
here IMP DL-up-go by land-toward-IMP
'You two come up here!'",[285]
"TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD239Rather, as in (5-80a) it simply expresses the speaker's wishes or desires
that the event will occur. Hence, it is the normal way to form a desider­
ative construction when the speaker is the experiencer, as in (5-80a) .
These desiderative constructions are curious in that they never allow
the use of the bound pronominal agreement affixes. For example, the
following is ungrammatical:
(5-81) * patn
na-ka-wayk-k
betelnut V SG V SG 0-1SG A-buy-IRR
( 5-81) can only be interpreted as a grammatical sentence if the irrealis is
interpreted as indicating the legendary past. This, then, is an important
structural difference between the legendary past use of the irrealis and
its desiderative use. A plausible explanation for the impossibility of
pronominal affixes in desiderative constructions like (5-80a) is that these
are elliptical versions of constructions with purpose clauses (see Section
7.1.3) and the main verb ti- 'feel, become', as in (5-82) .
(5-82) ama patn
way-k
ama-na-ti-n
1SG betelnut V SG buy-IRR 1SG S-DEF-feel/become-PRES
'I feel like buying betelnut.'
( 5-80a) arises from ( 5-82) by ellipsis of the main verb. This accounts for
the prohibition on pronominal affixes with desiderative verbs in -k, for
these affixes are also barred from purpose clauses, as with all non-finite
constructions.
Because the irrealis expresses unrealized future events, for which the
speaker is uncommitted as to whether they will or will not occur, it is
commonly used with hypothetical conditional clauses:
( 5-83) m-na-ya-nt-mp-n
NR DIST-DEF-come-PRES-VII SG-OBL
na-ka-apan-IJ
3SG 0-1SG A-spear-IRR
'If he comes, I'll shoot him.'
.J ust as in English, the protasis of these hypothetical conditional clauses
is marked with the present, but the apodosis is realized by the irrealis (in
l•:nglish, the future) . This pattern only occurs with true hypothetical
conditional clauses in Yimas, in which there is no commitment as to
whether the events will occur or not. Other types of conditionals and
counterfactuals are quite different (see Section 7.2.3) .
As the reader is probably aware by now from perusing the above
•·xarnples, the irrealis occurs in two allomorphs -k ""' -vk (with resulting
duster simplification to v in word final position) . The latter occurs
when the preeeding eonsonant is a nasal and - k occurs elsewhere. The240BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYallomorph - yk also has an optional subvariant 0 when the preceding
nasal is also / :U / .
5.2.1.2 The Suffix -kia
This is one of the more mysterious, yet ubiquitous suffixes in Yimas.
Unlike -k IRR, which has cognates in other Lower Sepik languages, -kia
may be a borrowing from Iatmul, the prestige language of the middle
Sepik, in which -kiy;J marks future tense. Whatever its origin -kia is now
fully integrated into the verbal morphology of Yimas.
Like its probable Iatmul source, one of the basic usages of -kia is to
mark future tense. In combination with the definitive prefix na- DEF,
discussed in Section 5.2.1 .4.2, and the irrealis -k, -kia marks the near
future, i.e., events which are fully expected to occur tomorrow.
(5-84) a. :uar:u
na-kay-Jla-awl-kia-k
1 day removed V SG 0-lPL A-DEF-get-NR FUT-IRR

ama-na-waraca-mpi-wa-kia-k
b. num-n
village-OBL lSG S-DEF-return-SEQ-go-NR FUT-IRR
'I'm going back to the village tomorrow.'
The other uses of -kia seem to be derivative from this near future
meaning. A very important fact to be noted about Yimas traditional
time reckoning in that a full day is seen to elapse from sunset to sunset,
rather than from sunrise to sunrise as in English or Tok Pisin. Because
of the influence of Tok Pisin or English-based schooling, there is some
confusion about the proper reckoning of a full day among most younger
present day Yimas speakers, but sunset to sunset is the traditional view.
Thus, if someone is speaking at noon about an event which is going to
occur in that evening or night, those events must be talked about as
occurring in the next day, and hence marked with -kia NR FUT. Because
of this, -kia has become associated with the idea of nighttime, and can be
used with a number of tense/aspect morphemes to indicate specifically
that the events occur at night.

'Bring back fire for us.' (for all of us villagers, even those

These three sets of examples put into sharp relief the contrast between
tav- COM and -va BEN. In (6-67a) , for the benefactive reading, the
beneficiary D participant as the potential possessor of the trees cut,
is present and probably cooperating during the act of cutting. Thus,
tav- COM must be used. In (6-67b) with va BEN the D participant is
absent during the action. Within the Yimas cultural view this situation
would normally arise when the beneficiary was too ill or too old to
participate in the task himself. (6-68a) with tav- expresses physical and
temporal proximity between the A and D participants during the act of
skin cutting. It is the skin of the D participant which is cut, as part
of the formal ritual cycle of male initiations. The suffix -va in (6-68b)
indicates that the D participant cannot be present at the site of the
beneficial act. Hence the skin being pierced must belong to some other
entity. Finally, note the interesting contrast in (6-69). With tav-, the
group of beneficiaries of the act is restricted to those present when the
command is given, if you like, the class of co-speakers, whereas with va­
it includes everyone, even the villagers absent at the time the command
was given. In all cases, tav- is associated with physical and temporalSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES311proximity between the A and D participants, while va- denotes distance
between them.
Benefactive nominals are almost invariably coded as core arguments:
i.e., realization as oblique constituents, either with -n ""' -nan OBL or a
postposition, is unavailable to them. The sole exception to this general­
ization occurs when there is no core argument slot available, a situation
which arises when a verb is already formally ditransitive. Three core ar­
guments for a verb is the maximum permitted by Yimas; the following
are ungrammatical:
(6-70) a. * ya-ka-tkam-IJa-r-mpan-akn
V PL T-lSG A-show-BEN-PERF-3PL D-3SG D

b. * anti

k-ka-pul-l]a-r-ak-mpun
VIII SG T-lSG A-rub-BEN-PERF-3SG D-3PL D
'I rubbed dirt on him for them.'
In such cases the benefactive participant must be realized as an oblique
constituent, using the allative postposition nampan 'towards, because
of', to be discussed in more detail in the next section. Thus, the con­
cepts behind the ungrammatical examples of (6-70) would be actually
expressed in Yimas as follows:
( 6-71) a. ya-ka-tkam-r-mpun
na-nampan
V SG T-lSG A-show-PERF-3PL D 3SG-because of
'I showed these to them for him.' (because he asked me to )

ground VIII SG VIII SG T-lSG A-rub-PERF-3SG D
mpu-nampan
3PL-because of
'I rubbed dirt on him for them.' (because they asked me to)
Although sentences like those in ( 6-71) are grammatical, they are actu­
ally quite rare. Such a complex idea is most likely to be expressed in
Yimas in more than one predication, i.e., in a complex sentence, such as
'he told me to show those to them, and so I took them, and they saw
those'.
6.2.3.3.3 Allative ira-. The allative relation is one in which the A partic­
ipant performs the action in the direction of another participant, which
is expressed as the allative nominal. The allative prefix ira- parallels
tav- COM in that nominals coded with it enter into a paradigmatic al-312THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREternation with oblique constituents marked with a postposition. Just as
tav- is linked with the postposition kantk 'with', ira- ALL is associated
with nampan 'toward, because of'. Thus, we have the following pairs:

'He turned back and came toward her. '
Although both the (a) and (b) examples above are grammatical, the
constructions with ira-, in which the allative nominal is realized as a
core argument, are much more common and greatly preferred. This
is similar to the preference for tav- COM as opposed to kantk, but if
anything, ira- is even more favored. The (a) constructions above, while
grammatical, are slightly stilted. In spontaneous ongoing discourse, ira­
ALL is nearly invariably found instead of nampan 'toward, because of'.
Example ( 6-73b) is noteworthy because it illustrates the application of
valence increasing by ira- at the level of the verb stem inside a complex
verb theme composed of a serial verb construction. The monovalent
verb root ya- 'come' is derived into a bivalent verb by ira-. This then
combines with the monovalent verb stem way-mpi turn-SEQ to form a
verb theme which is itself bivalent and hence occurs with two agreement
affixes na- 3SG 0 and n- 3SG A.
Other examples of the use of ira- are given below:

"AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY3536.4 An Explicit Account of Yimas Verbal Morphology
In the last chapter and the previous sections of this chapter, I have pre­
sented a detailed discussion of the structure and categories of Yimas
verbal morphology. Within the verb, I have distinguished three levels of
structure: root, stem, and theme, and I have shown how the morphemes
of these three levels interact. I have also attempted a fairly careful de­
scription of the meanings and functions of the morphemes in the various
morphological categories, such as tense suffixes, pronominal affixes and
valence altering affixes, etc. In this section, I will try to draw all this
together and present a fairly explicit and coherent account of Yimas
verbal morphology.
Perhaps the primary bifurcation in the Yimas verb is that reflected
in the division of material between this chapter and the previous one.
This is the split between the categories within the verb theme, e.g. , ad­
verbials, serialized verbs, valence altering affixes, and those outside of
it, e.g., pronominal affixes, aspect, tense, and mood. In more traditional
terms, this corresponds. to the difference between derivational and inflec­
tional morphology, respectively. Derivational morphology is normally
described as that belonging properly to the lexicon, generating a new
complex form from a simplex base form, while inflectional morphology is
held to belong to the clause as a whole, specifying semantic and syntac­
tic categories at this level. Derivational morphology is usually optional,
while some categories of inflectional morphology in a language are of­
ten obligatory. While this distinction can be drawn in Yimas (as I just
did above), I do not believe it is of any great value in the description
of the language. I believe that ultimately all of the verbal morphology
in Yimas is produced as the result of derivational processes. There is
no sudden switch in the structural behavior of the verbal morphology
when one passes from inside of the verb theme to outside, so there are
no motivated grounds for drawing a distinction between two types of
morphology at this boundary. Rather the whole structure of a Yimas
verb is the result of ordered processes of morphological derivation, as I
will demonstrate below.
But before proceeding to this, let me first dispose of the argument
that the verbal morphology should be produced via syntactic rules. I
cannot consider all classes of morphology here, so let me consider what
might be the most promising cases-valence altering. There are a cou­
ple of compelling arguments for treating valence changing as a lexical
derivation process and not a case of a syntactic rule. First, note that
although Yimas has numerous productive valence increasing affixes, the
final output of these derivations can never be more than a trivalent verb
stem, the maximum permitted for underived verb roots like va- 'give' or354THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREi- 'tell'. In other words, the result of the valence increasing rules must
be the equivalent of the valence of a base lexical item. This constraint
makes sense if the valence increasing rules occur in the lexicon, but does
not if they are independent syntactic processes.
Now let me consider the second argument. Remember, as noted in
earlier sections, that valence increasing prefixes may have alternate con­
structions involving postpositions, as in the following examples, repeated
from previous sections.( 6-150) a. ipa kantk pu-mampi-wa-k
1PL with 3PL S-again-go-IRR
'They went with us. '
b . pu-kra-mampi-tau-wa-k
3PL A-1PL 0-again-COM-go-IRR
'They went with us.'
( 6-151 ) a. na-nampan na-way-mpi-ya-ntut
3SG-toward 3SG S-turn-SEQ-come-RM PAST
'He turned back and came toward her.'
b. na-n-way-mpi-ira-ya-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-turn-SEQ-ALL-come-RM PAST
'He turned back and came toward her.'
In the ( a) examples, a participant in the event appears as an oblique
phrase, while in the ( b ) examples, it is a core argument. Thus, oblique
nominals marked by the postpositions kantk 'with' and nampan 'toward'
correspond to core nominals coded by the valence increasing prefixes tav­
COM or ira- ALL, respectively. From the structural alternations and the
paraphrase equivalences between the ( a) and (b ) examples above, one
may conclude that there is a convincing case for a productive syntactic
process in Yimas which promotes oblique nominals to core arguments,
much as dative shift constructions are commonly analyzed in English:
he gave a book to Mary becomes he gave Mary a book.
This analysis, however, runs into immediate problems when we con­
sider the entire range of valence increasing affixes in Yimas. For most
of these, unlike tav- COM and ira- ALL, there is simply no alternative
construction in which the core argument licensed by the valence increas­
ing prefix appears as an oblique nominal. In other words, there are no
paraphrase equivalents such as the ( a) examples in ( 6-150) and ( 6-151 )
for these examples:( 6-152 ) a. na-n-taukway-iray-Jlcut
3SG 0-3SG A-VIS-cry-RM PAST
'He cried over her.' ( looking at her body)AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY355b. na-n-pampay-iray-pra-k
3SG 0-3SG A-KIN-cry-toward-IRR
'He cried carrying her toward the village.'
The ideas behind the examples in (6-152) can only be expressed in this
way; alternatives with oblique nominals do not exist (although para­
phrases employing two clauses are possible). This casts grave doubt on
the productive syntactic analysis of valence increasing in Yimas. There
are no plausible underlying syntactic constructions from which the ex­
amples in (6-152) can be derived. Rather one must conclude that they
(and, by extension (6- 150b) and (6- 151b)) are base generated. Further,
because the sequence of valence affix plus verb root forms a single verb
stem, this base generation must be accomplished by morphological rules
and most likely accomplished in the lexicon.
Having established the morphological basis of such processes as va­
lence changing, it is now time to turn to a more detailed account of
the derivation of Yimas verb forms. This model of Yimas verbal mor­
phology means that the entire polysynthetic structure of a verb, with
all its elaborate morphological specifications, is produced by a complex,
ordered series of derivations. The morphological rules which accomplish
these derivations are located in a component of the lexicon. It will be the
task of the remainder of this section to elucidate explicitly the internal
structure of this derivational process in its various stages.
The starting point, of course, for all Yimas verbs is a verb root: these
are all entered separately in the lexicon. Let us represent a verb root
with the symbol Vo .
The next state is the derivation of verb stems from verb roots. The
verb stem is represented by V1. There are a number of processes which
derive verb stems, i.e., convert Yo to V 1 : reduplication, noun incorpora­
tion, and valence altering. These processes are themselves hierarchically
arranged. The most basic, i.e the one applied first, is reduplication.
Reduplication seems to be the most lexicalized of all derivational pro­
cesses: there are two bits of evidence to support this. First, there is a
special dissimilation rule that applies to reduplicated forms that does
not apply elsewhere in the grammar (rule (2-7)) . This removes the F
autosegment from a reduplicated segment, so that wul- 'put in water'
reduplicated is wurt-, not *wult-. This is a specialized phonological rule,
something to be expected for a highly lexicalized process. Second, Yi­
mas has some irregular reduplicated forms: ira- 'dance' reduplicated is
iranta-, not *irata- . This, again, would be expected of a highly lexi­
ealized process. So, applying reduplication to two representative verb
roots, we have the following derivations:356
(6-153)THE V ERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURE
v1/ �REDREDVo\�a i'put in'/Vo\J/a k'break'arkarkapapiThis derivation can be stated as the lexical rule V 1 = (RED) + Vo .
The next stem-level derivational process is noun incorporation. As
mentioned in Section 6.2.5, this is a sporadic process which often re­
sults in idiomatic constructions, a feature diagnostic of a highly lexi­
calized process. The only productive type is incorporation of nominal­
ized adjectives. Diagrammatic examples of noun incorporation are given
below:

ADJ

Combining reduplication and noun incorporation in one lexical rule, we
have V1 = (N) + (RED) + Vo .
Finally, we turn to the most common and most varied type of verb
stem derivation: valence alterations. All valence changing processes but
possessor raising and va- BEN are possible at the level of the verb stem.
A couple of examples illustrating valence changing inside serial verb
constructions (hence on the level of the verb stem) follow:
(6-155) a. na-n-way-mpi-ira-ya-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-turn-SEQ-ALL-come-RM PAST
'He turned and came toward her.'

b. tpwi
sago X PL X PL 0-3DL A-gather-KIN-ascend-NIGHT-IRR
'They both were gathering sago and carrying it up with
them.'
Valence altering affixes not uncommonly co-occur with the other two
derivational categories of the verb stem, reduplication and noun incor­
poration.","[368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"
"LOCATIONALS107Examples of these locational postpositions are given below:
pawmpn
'underneath' (trees)
'at the bottom, below' u rnkun
mawn
'above, at the top'
akpJlan
'behind'
wampuJlan
'in front of'
wampuun < wampu!J 'heart' + -n OBL
'inside'
tapukapn < tapukap 'outside' + -n OBL
'outside'
'outside' + -n OBL
'at the side of'
ayukn
< ayuk
Some of these are transparently derived from nouns by affixing the
oblique suffix. A few other locational words are still nouns because
they can be pluralized. Examples are kcpn 'space underneath a house',
PL: kcpnkat 'the spaces underneath houses'; and mawvkwat 'the other
side', PL: mawvkwara 'the spaces on or at the sides of a dwelling or
object'.
Although these looational postpositions most commonly occur in
postpositional phrases, they may also be used as free locationals. In
this sense, they are like English prepositions, as in John slept inside
versus John slept inside the house. So compare the following examples:
(3-27) a. akru
yampauk-n
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG head VI SG-OBL above VI SG-DEF-sit-PRES
' The frog is on top of (his) head.'
b. akru
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG above VI SG 8-DEF-sit-PRES
'The frog is on top.'
In the second example, the location which the frog is above is left unspec­
ified. It is either the position of some object inferred from the context
or may be taken to be the position of the speech event itself or some
event reported in the discourse.
Yimas has four other postpositions which may perhaps be treated
here and squeezed into the class of locationals, although they contrast
from those postpositions treated thus far in some important respects.
These postpositions are
nampan
'toward, for, because of'
nampayn
'like'
'toward, at the house/residence/property of (French chez ) ' naukun
kantk
' with, together'
These grammatical postpositions contrast with the locational postpo­
Hitions in that the preceding noun is never marked with the oblique
caHe suffix. Hence, these grammatical postpositions function like case108WORD CLASSESmarkers themselves, and this explains why they have more abstract re­
lational meanings in contrast to the concrete locational meanings of the
locational postpositions. Besides being postpositions, another feature
shared by members of both types is their ability to become specified
through prefixes to the verb. When this happens with a locational post­
position, the associated noun remains oblique, but with a grammatical
postposition, it becomes a core argument cross-referenced by a verbal
agreement prefix. Consider the following examples:
(3-28) a. panmal
numpk-n
mawn
man I SG mountain V SG-OBL above
na-na-taw-n
3SG S-DEF-sit-PRES
'The man is on top of the mountain.'
b. panmal
numpk-n
na-na-wi-caw-n
man-I SG mountain V SG-OBL 3SG 8-DEF-above-sit-PRES
'The man is on top on the mountain.'
(3-29) a. panmal IJaykum
kantk na-na-wa-n
man I SG woman-11 PL with 3SG-DEF-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
b. panmal IJaykum
pu-na-taiJ-wa-n
man I SG woman II PL 3PL 0-3SG A-DEF-COM-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
In (3-28a) the oblique noun numpuk-n 'mountain' is followed by the
postposition, mawn 'above', while in (3-28b) the oblique noun occurs
by itself, and the notion of 'above' is expressed by the verbal elevational
prefix wi- 'above', which triggers palatization of the following /t/. (For
a detailed discussion of elevational prefixes, see Section 6.3.3.) Sentences
(3-28) (a) and (b) are not perfectly synonymous in all senses. (3-28a)
would normally be taken to mean 'the man is at the top of the mountain'.
Although the reading 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
on the mountain' is possible, it is definitely not preferred. (3-28b) has
the exact opposite ranking of preferred readings. It would normally
be taken to mean 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
somewhere on the mountain'. The reading 'the man is at the top of the
mountain' could only be a special case of the former reading, a discourse­
based inference. Thus, the structural difference between a locational
postposition and a verbal elevational prefix reflects a difference in the
preferential readings of the scope of ' above'. As a locational postposition,
it is primarily taken as a modifier of its oblique head noun, while as
a verbal elevational prefix, it is taken as a modifier of the verb and,TEMPORALS109more widely, the speech act. Note that this same contrast is carried in
English by the choice of the prepositions of versus on (see the English
translations of ( 3-28a, b)).
The examples (3-29a, b) are different in two respects. The noun
vaykum 'women' is not case marked by the oblique suffix, but is directly
followed by the postposition kantk 'with'. When the concept of 'with'
is expressed by the comitative verbal prefix tav-, naykum is necessar­
ily a core argument. This is demonstrated by its corresponding verbal
prefix pu-, which agrees with the noun in terms of number/class fea­
tures. (For a detailed discussion of the notion of core arguments and the
function of valence-increasing verbal affixes like tav- COM, see Section
6.2.3.3. These two examples also contrast with the previous two in that
they are absolutely synonymous. As far as can be determined, there
is no difference in sense whatsoever between (3-29) (a) and (b) . There
are pragmatic differences, however, concerning the contrastiveness of
vaykum 'women' (see Section 5.1.6).
In their true postpositional use, all four grammatical postpositions
require human (or at least higher animate) nouns or pronouns as their
objects. kantk has another adjectival-like use to express possession and
then is often found with inanimate object nouns, but that is not of
concern here (see Section 4.5) . nampan, navkun, and nampayn contrast
with kantk in that their objects, when pronouns, must be in the form
of the bound possessive prefixes (see Section 4.5). This is prohibited for
kantk, whose pronoun objects must be the free forms.

Temporals express the time setting of an action. Temporals are of two
types in Yimas, basic temporals and nouns metaphorically used as tem­
porals. Basic temporals are themselves of several types:General temporals:muntawktn
kal]kran
tampin
mpa'at first'
'before, early'
'after, later'
'now, already'Parts of the day:kratut

wut'twilight' (5:00-6:00)
'morning' (6:00-9:00)
'late afternoon' ( 17:00-19:00)
'night' ( 19:00-5:00)WORO CLASSES1 10There is no specific word to refer to the main part of the day from about
9:00-17:00 hours. The general word tmal 'sun, day' can be used for
this period, and more specifically, the phrase kpa tmal 'big sun' can be
used for the middle, hottest part of the day. In parallel fashion, kpa
wut 'big night' can be used to refer to the period around midnight. In
addition speakers often use the Tok Pisin word belo 'noon' for the very
specific period between 12:00-13:00, when government offices are closed,
and people would have lunch in the towns.
Day counters:kwarkwa
IJarlJ
urakr!J
tnwant!J
kampraJlCIJ
manmaJlCIJ'today'
'one day removed'
(i.e., 'yesterday, tomorrow')
'two days removed'
'three days removed'
'four days removed'
'five days removed'Yimas has the interesting, but not unusual, Papuan system of reckoning
time from the point 'now' Janus-like in both directions, so that one day
in the past (yesterday) and one day in the future (tomorrow) are both
denoted by the same term varr). The actual time referred to by varr.J is
distinguished by the choice of tense on the verb, near past (yesterday)
versus near future (tomorrow) (see Section 5.2.1).
Yimas also has two basic nouns used metaphorically as temporals.
These nouns contrast with all previous temporals in that when they are
used as temporals, they must be suffixed with the oblique case suffix.
mlantrm-nan
moon, month V DL-OBL
'in two months'tmat-jlan
sun, day V SG-OBL
'during the day'They are, however, not the only temporals which some morphological
features of nouns. A few temporal words from all types except the
general temporals may form close-knit noun phrases with the adjective
ma- 'other' to mean 'on another ' Such noun phrases formed with the
temporal nouns or the words for parts of the day occur with the oblique
suffix.

Another morphologically induced stress peculiarity concerns adjecti­

a nominal concord marker, regardless of the number of syllables of the
stem. Examples follow. (The concord marker is -n for class V singular).

itly as follows:

Note that this rule blocks the operation of the secondary stress rule (217) for the pentasyllabic words. Normally, these would have secondary
stress on the antepenultimate syllable by rule (2-17), but rule (2-20) is
more restricted in its domain and hence overrides it, so that the sec­
ondary stress appears on the penultimate syllable, the final syllable of
the roots.
The final morphologically induced peculiarity of stress concerns verbs
inflected with pronominal prefixes (see Section 5.1.1). These arc norkantamdhnurkupwicdkin

In each of these cases the primary stress assigns stress to the verb root
as if there were no prefixal syllables; in other words, they are ignored
for the purposes of the stress rules.
2.6 Boundaries and the Notion of the Word
If one approaches the notion of word from a formal perspective, it is
clear that it can be defined in either of two ways: either by phonological
criteria or by morphosyntactic ones. (Di Sciullo and Williams (1987)
have recently proposed that this latter actually disguises two distinct
types of criteria for the word, morphological ones versus syntactic ones.
They propose some very useful and interesting ideas, but for the pur­
poses here we will treat both of these types under the single category
of morphosyntactic criteria) . A word can be determined by phonolog­
ical criteria in terms of the rules, both segmental and suprasegmental,
whose domain is specified with respect to this notion. For example,
Yimas provides a number of rules which help us to determine words.
The final nasal plus stop cluster simplification rule (2-14) only applies
at the ends of words; initial semivowel formation (2-10) only applies at
the beginning of words; and most of the other rules, such as R spreading
(2-8), (but not, notably, palatalization (2-3)) occur internally to a word.
In addition, the stress rules of Yimas discussed in the previous section
also help to define the word, for they supply to every word unit at least
a primary stress and possibly one or more secondary stresses. Thus, any
string of phonemes which behave as a unit with respect to these rules can
be designated as a word and set off by the word boundaries before and
after it. So because the underlying phoneme sequence /awklmp/ 'wrist'
is realized phonetically as (awkulim] (from initial syllable primary stress
(2-16), vowel epenthesis (2-2), R spreading (2-8), and final nasal plusBOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD81stop cluster simplification (2-14) ) , we know that it constitutes a single
word with the placement of word boundaries thus /# awklmp #/.
Turning now to morphosyntactic criteria, we can state analogously
that a word is a string of morphemes that behaves as a single unit
with respect to morphological processes in the language. The strictly
morphological processes of a language, of course, are a language-specific
fact: some languages such as Vietnamese may have no morphological
processes at all; others, like Yimas, have an exuberance of these. Let
me first consider the morphological patterns of nouns in Yimas. Nouns
are marked for number in Yimas, as well as case. Thus, consider the
above noun 'wrist' inflected for these two categories: jawklmp + l +
nan/ wrist + DL + OBL realized phonetically as [awkulimbitJlan]
'on the two wrists'. The plus sign here is used conventionally to mark
a morpheme boundary, i.e. , a boundary between morphemes internal
to a word. This form is morphologically a single composite unit. The
morphemes must occur in this order and no other:
jawklmp + l + nan/ wrist + DL + OBL,
* jawklmp + nan + 1/ wrist + OBL + DL,
* /1 + awklmp + nan/ DL + wrist + OBL, etc.
Further, no other morphemes may be inserted internal to this sequence:
* jawklmp + kpa + l + nan/ wrist + big + DL + OBL,
* /awklmp + l + kpa + nan/ wrist + DL + big + OBL,
* / awklmp + prpal + l + nan/ wrist + two + DL + OBL,
* jawklmp + l + prpal + nan/ wrist + DL + two + OBL.
From the grammatical point of view, this noun forms a composite unit,
a word, and should therefore be represented as /# awklmp + l + nan
# /, with both the internal morpheme boundaries + and the external
word boundary # indicated.
Note that the grammatical criteria in this case coincide with the
phonological criteria in defining this as a single word-level unit. Whereas
the uninflected form jawklmp/ undergoes final nasal plus stop clus­
ter simplification (2-14) to surface as [awkulim], thus indicating a word
boundary, this rule fails to apply to j awklmp + l + nan/, which is re­
alized as [awkulimbftJlan] . This leaves no doubt that there is no word
boundary between the root for 'wrist' and the DL suffix in this form.
This is buttressed by the fact that the fp/ is voiced to [b] following the
nasal. Postnasal voicing of stops in Yimas is all but obligatory internal to
a word. Further, the liquid strengthening rule (2-5) applies in this form
between the /-1/ DL and the initial /n/ of the oblique suffix /-nanj.
T his rule, like most phonological rules treated earlier, is restricted to82PHONOLOGYapplying internally to the word across morpheme boundaries. (Palatal­
ization (2-3) is the one exception here: it does commonly apply across
word boundaries.) Clearly, then, both the grammatical criteria and the
phonological criteria unambiguously identify /awklmp + 1 + nan/ wrist
+ DL + OBL [awkulimbitJlan] as a single word.
Similar considerations apply to adjectives. Consider the form of the
adjective 'big' which would modify the inflected noun above: /kpa +
mp + 1/ big + class VII + DL, realized as [kipambH] . This demonstrates
that adjectives are inflected for the class and number of their modified
noun. Again the ordering of morphemes is rigid.
* /kpa + 1 + mp/ big + DL + class VII,
* jmp + kpa + 1/ class VII + PL + big;
and nothing may be inserted between the morphemes.
* /kpa + prpal + mp + 1/ big + two + class VII + DL,
* /kpa + mp + prpal + 1/ big + class VII + two + DL,
* /kpa + plak + mp + 1/ big + this + class VII + DL,
* /kpa + mp + plak + 1/ big + class VII + this + DL.
All this indicates that /kpa + mp + 1/ big + class VII + DL is a com­
posite unit, a single word. Again the phonological criteria bring down
the same verdict. The class VII concord marker /-mp/ appears phonet­
ically as [mp] , rather than as its word final allomorph [m] derived by
final nasal plus stop cluster simplification (2-14). Clearly there is no
word boundary between the class VII concord marker and the DL suffix,
so that the form can be established as / # kpa + mp + 1 # /.
The coincidence between phonological and grammatical criteria for
determining word boundaries vanishes, however, when we turn to verbs.
They are by far the most morphologically complex part of speech in
Yimas, but here I will concern myself only with negation and valence­
increasing, both of which are marked by prefixes. Negation is an espe­
cially good diagnostic of words, for it affects both the first morpheme of
a word and the last. Negation is marked by a prefix ta-. which occupies
the first prefixal slot of the verb, usurping the normal occupier of this
slot, a pronominal prefix, and shifting this to the final suffixal slot of the
word. Thus, consider the following pair:
(2-22) a. tampaym
p-ka-apca-t
hook VII SG VII SG 0-lSG A-hang up-PERF
'I hung up the hook.'
b. tampaym
ta-ka-apca-r-m

Here, the complement verb consists of a verb theme formed by a serial

7.1.3 Purpose Clauses
Purpose clauses share a number of the grammatical properties of com­
plements, but contrast with the latter in that they never function as a
core argument of the matrix verb. Rather, they function somewhat like
oblique constituents of the matrix verb, expressing the intended goal of
the action of the matrix verb. Purpose clauses are like complements in
that they are non-finite: they never occur with pronominal agreement
affixes or true tense suffixes (only the irrealis suffix) . Purpose clauses are
always controlled: the A or S of a purpose clause can never be overtly
expressed and is always coreferential with a human core argument of the
matrix verb. Normally this is the S or A participant, but if the verb has
more than one human participant, it is possible for the 0 or D to be the
controller. ( See example ( 7-61c) below. ) The verb in a purpose clause
is marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' -vk, as in these examples:
( 7-61 ) a. rna IJarlJ
wa!Jkia
awl-k
other 1 day removed rafters IX PL get-IRR
ipa-wa-ntut
1PL S-go-RM PAST
'Next day we went to get (wood for) rafters.'
b. wut am-kia-k

'At night he went inside to eat.'

kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-1SG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
taiJkway-cakal-k
VIS-grasp-IRR
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
In ( 7-61a,b) the matrix verbs are monovalent verbs of motion with only
an S participant, which is then the controller of the purpose clause. NoteNON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS403further the presence of -kia in both the matrix verb and that of the pur­
pose clause. Its presence on both verbs is obligatory. True complements
diverge here in prohibiting -kia. Example (7-61c) has a bivalent main
verb with two human arguments, an A, vaykum 'women', and an 0, va­
lSG 0. The controller of the purpose clause must be the 0 participant:
witness the above translation. (7-61c) cannot have A control (*'it was
the women who sent me so that they could look after the children').
The irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk is the general and common marker of
purpose clauses, but in one specific context there is an alternative to it.
If the act denoted by the purpose clause is to be carried out directly and
immediately as the result of a directive speech act, such as a request or
an order, then the marker for a complement of speech - mpwi 'talk' plus
the immediate aspect clitic mpan IMM may be used. Compare (7-62)
with (7-61c) above:
(7-62) !Jaykum
m-IJa-wampak-c-um
kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-lSG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
ta!Jkway-cakal-cu-mpwi mpan
IMM
VIS-grasp-NFN-talk
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
Examples (7-61c) and (7-62) are very close in structure and meaning.
They structurally contrast in that (7-61c) has the irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk
while (7-62) has the form of a complement with -ru NFN plus - mpwi
'talk' and the clitic mpan IMM. The meaning difference is that (7-62)
requires an immediately prior verbal order or request to someone that
they look after the children. This is not the case in (7-6lc); although
this scenario is possible, others are also, such as an arrangement made
days earlier or a pre-established custom that one does regularly. It
needs to be noted that not all speakers make this contrast. For some
speakers the contrast is one of immediacy; for them purpose clauses in
-mpwi mpan need to follow directly from the action of the matrix verb.
Other speakers seem to use the two ways of forming purpose clauses
interchangeably. And even some speakers who make it in some contexts
do not make it in others. It appears to be a semantic distinction well on
its way to being lost.
7.1.4 Non-Finite Relative Clauses
Yimas has two types of constructions corresponding to English relative
clauses. A relative clause is a clause-level construction (or more formally,
an S) which modifies a noun, such as the dog [which chased the cat] , in
which the relative clause which chased the cat modifies the noun dog ,
generally called the head of the relative clause. This relative clause404INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSis embedded as a constituent within the whole noun phrase, so that
the constituent structure is [the dog [which chased the cat]] . Both of
the Yimas relative clause types differ from English relative clauses in
that they are never embedded, but are simply nominalized forms of
verbs appositionally linked to a noun they modify, their 'head noun',
rather like juxtaposed possessive nominals. The two types of relative
clauses in Yimas contrast as to whether they are tensed or not. Non­
finite relative clauses are prohibited from occurring with tense suffixes
and instead have - ru NFN plus one of the set of suffixes which mark
agentive nominalizations (for head nouns referring to humans) or one
of the possessive/adjectival concord suffixes (for non-humans). Finite
relative clauses, which will be discussed in detail in Section 7.2.1, are
formed with or without the stem m- NR DIST, but require a true tense
suffix. This difference correlates closely with a meaning difference. Non­
finite relative clauses denote traits or characteristic actions of the noun
modified, while finite relative clauses denote states which hold or actions
which occur within the time frame denoted by the tense suffix on their
verbs. Consider this contrast in the following examples:
(7-63) a. namarawt [awt pampay-kulan-t-awt]
person I SG fire KIN-walk-NFN-M SG
'the person who tends the fire' (as his job)
b. namarawt [awt m-na-pampay-kulana:u]
person I SG fire NR DIST-DEF-KIN-walk
'the person who is tending the fire' (right now, others may
do so at other times)
The glosses in (7-63) clearly bring out the meaning contrast between the
non-finite (7-63a) and the finite (7-63b) relative clauses. The non-finite
relative clause expresses a long duration characteristic action, hence the
reading of the action as a job, while the finite relative clause denotes
the action as occurring within the time frame of the tense suffix, 'right
now', as the tense in (7-63b) is present imperfective. A similar contrast
can be found with states.
(7-64) a. namarawt [tamana
ti-r-awt]
na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG feel-NFN-M SG 3SG S-die
'The person who was always sick died.'
b. namarawt [tamana
kantk-n] na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG with-I SG 3SG S-die
'The sick person died.'
The non-finite relative clause in (7-64a) denotes a typical characteristic
state. The copula anak COP 3SG has been deleted in (7-64b), leaving
just the postpositional phrase inflected with the concord suffix - n I SGNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS405as the finite relative clause (the copula could be inserted, but it is better
to omit it). Again, the finite relative clause is bounded in time, denoting
a temporary, transitory state of illness.
The syntax of non-finite and finite relative clauses is nearly identical
and because the latter are the more common type, I will discuss the
syntax of relative clauses in detail in Section 7.2.1. The one significant
difference between the two types is in the range of core argument posi­
tions which are relativizable (Keenan and Comrie 1977). The relativized
noun is that obligatorily missing argument of the relative clause which
must be coreferential with the noun modified, the 'head'. Any core ar­
guments plus locationals and temporals are relativizable with a finite
relative clause, but the relativized nouns in non-finite relative clauses
are restricted to S or A arguments. This is readily explicable, because
non-finite relative clauses are nothing but agentive nominalizations in
apposition to some nominal (the 'head noun'). Hence the noun which
they relativize must belong to the same general class as agentive nom­
inalizations, i.e., either S or A. Interestingly, as ( 7-65c) shows, it is
possible to use a non-finite relative clause to relativize a nominal which
is a non-agentive S. Examples of non-finite relative clause are provided
below:
(7-65) a. m-ukt

c. mukawu yampara-t-uu
post X SG stand-NFN-X SG
ku-ka-pay-pu-t
X SG 0-lSG A-carry-away-PERF
'I took the post for standing up.'
A slight morphological peculiarity of non-finite relative clauses (one
they share with non-finite oblique clauses to be discussed in the next406INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSsection) concerns singular class III and V nouns functioning as 'heads'.
Instead of the expected concord suffix -n III/V SG in this case, what
is actually found is the agentive nominalization suffix - awt M SG, as in
this example:
(7-66) kakam
[awt yara-t-awt]
tree (sp) V SG fire pick up-NFN-M SG
'a (piece of kakam) wood for picking up fire'
Other inanimate nouns are regular, in that the proper concord suffixes
are used.
(7-67) awruk
[awt yara-t-u!J]
torch X SG fire pick up-NFN-X SG
'a torch for picking up fire'
In addition to the positive non-finite relative clauses exemplified thus
far, Yimas also possesses negative non-finite relative clauses, which ex­
press the lack of a state or characteristic action. These are formed with
the postposition - kakan 'without' which behaves morphologically like the
attributive kantk- 'with'. (See example (7-64b)), except that it uses the
agentive nominalization suffixes for human 'head' nouns. There is even
a further exception to this last generalization: for the singular of classes
I, III, and V, -kakan actually uses a zero morpheme, rather than either
the expected - awt M SG or - n I, III, V SG.) Consider these examples:
(7-68) a. wik
mpa-n [yaki
am-kakan-mat]
week V SG one-V SG tobacco eat-without-M PL
na-kay-caw-ntut
V SG 0-lPL A-sit-RM PAST
'We stayed one week without smoking tobacco.'
(This is an interesting example with the normally monovalent verb being
used transitively, with two pronominal agreement prefixes.)

"194BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYNote that the word order in both these sentences is exactly the same,
and further that neither of the nouns have any case marking affixes. Yet
their meanings are contrastive. This meaning difference is carried by
the different choice of verbal prefixes. In the first example, the prefixes
indicate a singular object and a plural subject. The associated plural
noun payum 'men' must therefore be the subject, and the singular noun
narmav 'woman' the object, resulting in 'the men saw the woman'. In
the (b) example, the inflectional pattern of the prefixes is the opposite,
indicating a singular subject and a plural object. Hence, the singular
noun narmav 'woman' must now be the subject and the plural noun
payum 'men', the object, expressing the meaning 'the woman saw the
men'. Note that the verbal affixes signal the grammatical relations of
core nominals rather indirectly: they associate a grammatical relation
with a certain person/number combination. The noun which matches
this person/number combination is then interpreted as filling the gram­
matical relation. If the person/number combinations of the pronominal
affixes are the same, ambiguous sentences may result.
(5-2) panmal narma!J
na-n-tay
man I SG woman II SG 3SG 0-3SG A-see
'The man saw the woman.' or
'The woman saw the man.'
Noun class distinctions may come to the rescue in many cases. This
does not help in (5-2) because, although the two nouns belong to dif­
ferent classes (classes I and II) the verbal prefixes for these clauses are
identical. If, however, the object were a class VI noun, the ambiguity
would disappear.
k-n-tay
narma!J
(5-3) kray!J
frog VI SG woman II SG VI SG 0-3SG A-see
'The woman saw the frog. '
* 'The frog saw the woman.'
The prefix k- VI SG is unambiguously associated with kray'f) 'frog',
which thereby must function as the object. The subject narmav 'woman'
is similarly identified by the prefix n- 3SG A. Hence (5-3) is unambiguous
and can only mean 'the woman saw the frog'.
I have been using the terms subject and object thus far in the exposi­
tion in a pre-theoretical and undefined way. These notions as understood
from the prism of English grammar are not entirely straightforward when
extended to Yimas. The notion of subject in English confiates the sub­
ject of an intransitive and a transitive verb and contrasts these to the
object of a transitive verb. Note, for example, that for the third person
singular masculine pronoun, English uses the same form for the sub-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS195ject of a transitive and an intransitive verb, but a different form for the
object of a transitive verb:
(5-4) a. He runs.
b. He hit him.
This English way of marking grammatical relations is called a nomin­
ative-accusative system, in which the nominative is the form for the
subject of the intransitive and transitive verb, and the accusative is the
form of the object of the transitive verb. In a system like this, subject is a
well defined notion in that it always corresponds to the nominative form.
Object is equally well defined, always corresponding to the accusative
form.
Yimas is not so straightforward, and the system of grammatical re­
lations as assigned by the prefixes cannot be so simply characterized.
Different person/number combinations work in different ways, but none
align grammatical relations exactly as in English. The prefixes asso­
ciated with third person participants vary in form according to their
position in the verb. There is one form for initial position and another
for non-initial position, as in (5-5):
(5-5) a. pu-wa-t
3PL S-go-PERF
'He went . '
b. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them.'
* 'They saw him. '
c. na-mpu-tay
3SG 0-3PL A-see
'They saw him.'
* 'He saw them.'
Note that when both prefixes refer to third person participants, this
schema based on linear order amounts in essence to an ergative-absolu­
tive marking system. The form pu- 3PL is used for the subject of an
intransitive verb (5-5a) and also functions for the object of a transitive
verb (5-5b) . On the other hand, the subject of the transitive verb has
the unique form mpu- 3PL. (I adopt Dixon's ( 1979) symbolism of S for
the subject of an intransitive verb, A for the subject of a transitive verb
and 0 for its object). We may diagram this contrast in the alignment
of grammatical relations between English and Yimas in the following
terms:196BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY
English:S: he
A: heS: pu-Yimas:
0: himnominative-accusativeA: mpu-0: pu-ergative-absolutiveThe ergative form is that for the A, the subject of the transitive verb­
in this Yimas example, mpu- 3PL. The absolutive corresponds to the
S, the subject of the intransitive verb, and the 0, the object of the
transitive verb-in this case, the prefix pu- 3PL. Note that at least in
these morphological terms, the notion of subject as employed in English
is not applicable to Yimas, for it fails to align A, S, and 0 in the way in
which this term is normally understood.
In fact the situation is more complex than this, for with the first
and second person prefixes, A, S, and 0 typically do not conflate at all,
each one of them having a distinct form, as in these examples of the first
person singular prefixes:
(5-6) a. ama-wa-t
lSG S-go-PERF
'I went.'
b. pu- ka-tay
3PL 0-lSG A-see
'I saw them. '
c. pu- va-tay
3PL A-lSG O-see
'They saw me.'
For the first person singular, ama- is the form for the S, ka- for A, and va­
for 0. (The alert reader will have noted the form pu- for A instead of the
expected mpu-; this is because it occurs initially. As mentioned above,
the form of the third person pronominal prefixes is largely determined
by linear order, as will be discussed in detail below.) These forms for
first singular contrast with those of third plural presented earlier in that
they do not display an ergative system. Instead of aligning S and 0 as
against A as do the third plural forms (pu- S , 0; mpu- A), all three are
distinct. This presents an equally difficult problem for extending the
English notion of subject to Yimas, for again the S fails to align with
A, the morphological defining characteristic of the notion subject for
English and for languages generally with nominative-accusative marking
conventions for grammatical relations.
Having said this, however, there is in fact some morphological evi­
dence in Yimas for a notion of subject along the lines of English. This
evidence appears in secondary verbal forms, particularly those with one
of the modal prefixes (see Section 5.2.2). When one of these modal pre-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS197fixes is added to a. verb which normally would occur with the S prefix
form, the prefix actually appears as the A form.
(5-7) a. ama-tmuk-t
lSG S-fall-PERF
'I fell down. '
b. ant-ka-tmuk-t
POT-lSG A-fall-PERF
'I almost fell down. '
c.* ant-va-tmuk-t
POT-lSG 0-fall-PERF
(5-7a) is a straightforward verbal form with no modal prefixes in which
the S argument is indicated by the normal S form ama-. (5-7b) is a verb
inflected with the prefix for potential modality ant-, and the S argument
is inflected with the normal A form ka- instead of the expected S form
ama-. As (5-7c) indicates, the 0 prefix va- is ungrammatical in this
construction. Thus, in this construction the S argument surfaces with
the A prefix, rather than the 0 form, demonstrating a clear conflation of
S and A, that is, a nominative-accusative alignment reflecting a notion
of subject much like that of English.
The third person prefixes diverge here. When a modal prefix is added
to a verb with a third person S form prefix, this remains and does not
convert to an A prefix.
(5-8) a. pu-tmuk-t
3PL S-fall-PERF
'They fell down'
b. a-pu-tmuk-r-um
POT-3PL S-fall-PERF-PL
'They almost fell down. '
In (5-8a) , a verbal form without any modal prefix, the normal absolu­
t.ive form pu-, is used to indicate S. When the verb is inflected with the
potential modal prefix ant- (with the allomorph a- for third plural) , the
S form pu- is still used to indicate the S argument, unlike the compara­
ble situation for first and second person S arguments, which would be
i ndicated with the A prefix forms (compare (5-7b)) . So while the first
and second persons betray in their modally inflected verbs an underlying
nominative-accusative argument alignment, the third person does not,
the absolutive form being used in both normal and modally inflected
verbs.
It has already been mentioned that linear order imposes the primary
constraints on the form of verbal prefixes, particularly the third person198BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYones. The pronominal prefixes are normally the initial prefixes to a verb.
The only prefixes which may ever precede them are the modal prefixes.
,
For third person participants, Yimas requires the order 0 prefix-A prefix:
for example, for two third plural participants, pu-mpu- 3PL 0-3PL A.
Yimas has an additional stipulation (to be discussed in detail in the
following section) that the highest participant on a person hierarchy
1 > 2 > 3 should appear to the right, closest to the verb stem. Thus,
in constructions involving a third person A and a first or second person
0, the A will actually appear on the left, in initial position, outranked
for the rightmost position by the 0. Whenever this happens, the third
person A will actually surface in what is typically the 0 prefix form, as
in the following example:
(5-9) pu-nan-tay
3PL A-2SG O-see
'They saw you.'
The prefix pu- 3PL is actually the usual S/0 prefix form, being used
for A because it is in initial position. The normal corresponding A form
would be ungrammatical in this environment.
(5-10) a. * mpu-nan-tay
3PL A-2SG O-see
Interestingly, for some unknown reason, the third plural A form and only
this form may optionally appear in initial position if the 0 is first person
singular.
b. mpu-JJa-tay
1PL A-1SG O-see
'They saw me.'
There is no explanation forthcoming for this anomaly, but it does demon­
strate that the rules determining the forms of the prefixes cannot be
completely put down to linear order. Clearly, (5-lOb) supports the con­
tention that the basic underlying alignment for the third person prefixes
is ergative-absolutive, or A ( mpu-) versus S, 0 (pu- ).
Now when modal prefixes occur, they always occupy the initial prefix
position. Any co-occurring third person prefix must occur in the second
position, the position normally associated with the A form. Yet any
third person participant functioning as S will still surface with the S
prefix form in a verb inflected with a modal prefix.

"ADJECTIVES99tamana 'sick' functions as an adjectival noun in a phrase with kantk- in
(3-17a) , but as a nominal subject agreeing with the verb in number/class
in ( 3- 17b) . Only a noun could function as tamana does in ( 3-17b).
The postposition kantk- is used in these adjectival noun constructions
to carry the normal adjectival concord suffixes for the modified noun.
Other examples of the class of adjectival nouns are:
'sad'
'cold'
tark
yapan
'happy'
'dirty' wurk
wapun
'ashamed' irmut
Because these stems are basically nouns, they do not form inchoatives
in the same way as the true adjectives or adjectival verbs. Consider the
stative construction and the inchoative construction for the adjectival
noun wapun 'happy'.
kantk-n
(3-18) a. wapun
amayak
happy V SG with-V SG COP 1SG
'I'm happy. '
b. wapun
kantk-n
ama-na-ti-n
happy V SG with-V SG 1SG S-DEF-become-PRES
'I'm becoming/feeling happy. '
The first sentence means something like 'I have or am feeling some­
thing which is good, so I am happy' . The second goes like 'I am do­
ing/experiencing something good, and I'm becoming/feeling happy be­
cause of that.' The first sentence would be uttered when a person is
happy because of the property or clothes he owns, while the second is
appropriate to contexts of, say, just finishing a carving or house. Thus,
the form with the copula is appropriate for longer duration or relatively
permanent states and the form with ti- for transitory states or changes
of state. But there are other inchoative constructions available to adjec­
tival nouns by virtue of their status as nouns.
(3-19) a. wapun
ama-na-pay-n
happy V SG 1SG S-DEF-liejcarry-PRES
'I'm feeling happy. '
b. wapun
na-IJa-na-ti-n
happy V SG V SG S-1SG 0-DEF-dojfeel-PRES
'I'm feeling happy.' (literally 'happiness does/feels on me')
In these examples the adjectival noun functions as a nominal core argu­
ment of the verb-an object in (3-19a) and a subject in (3- 19b) . These
t.wo sentences contrast in meaning. (3-19a) means 'I'm doing something
��:ood and I'm feeling happy because of that', i.e., very close in meaning
t.o (3- 1 8b) . The difference between (3-18b) and (3-19a) is that the lat-100WORD CLASSESter is appropriate in contexts describing something about the speaker's
demeanor and appearance. For example, if the speaker has just dressed
up in new clothes and thinks he looks very handsome and smart, he
will likely utter (3-19a). (3-18b) , on the other hand, is more appropri­
ate when just having finished a difficult task. The final construction
(3-19b) contrasts with both (3-18b) and (3-19a) in that one feels happy
not because of anything one has done, but because of something that has
happened, often without any input from the experiencer. (3-19b) then
would be an appropriate utterance on just winning the lottery or receiv­
ing an unsolicited gift. Constructions such as (3-19b) are only possible
for adjectival nouns denoting human sensations (see (3-17b) also) . Con­
sider their construction with upwi 'hot' (compare with (3-16b) above) :
(3-20) a. narm
upwi p-ua-na-wampaki-n
skin VII SG hot VII SG A-1SG D-DEF-throw-PRES
'I'm feeling hot.' (literally 'skin throws heat on me'
'my skin throws heat')
b. narm
upwi p-ua-na-ti-n
skin VII SG hot VII SG A-1SG D-DEF-do/feel-PRES
'I'm feeling hot.' (literally 'skin does heat on me' or
'my skin does/feels heat')
Again, these constructions express an involuntary change of state which
the experiencer does nothing to bring about. It is something which hap­
pens to him, rather than something he does. This contrast between vol­
untary actions and involuntary changes in state, especially of sensations,
is a pervasive feature of Papuan languages and is realized morphologi­
cally and syntactically in many of them (see Foley 1986, 121-7).
The final stems expressing qualities which I wish to consider in this
section are those denoting speed. In Yimas, these are not adjectives,
verbs, or nouns; they are adverbs, normally bound morphemes incorpo­
rated directly into the verbal complex.

as in (3-21a, b) . Used as adjectives stems, either without -k (3-21c) or
with (3-21d) , they produce ungrammatical constructions.
3.4 Quantifiers
The numeral system of Yimas is quite complex, but is based fundamen­
tally on the fingers and toes of a human being. It operates simultane­
ously with three bases: base twenty, base ten and base five. The stems
denoting these bases are invariable, but all other numerals vary for noun
class depending on the features of the noun which are being counted.
Further, not all numerals agreeing for noun class do so in the same
way: the numbers 'one' and 'four' (and higher numbers ending in these
units) agree like adjectives using suffixes, while 'two' and 'three' (and
again higher numbers ending in these units) take the verbal agreement
prefixes. Thus, for the class VII noun tanm 'bone', mpa- 'one' takes
the adjectival agreement suffix -m ( tanm mpa-m 'one bone'), but -rpal
'two' takes the verbal agreement prefix p- ( tanpl p-rpal 'two bones').
Although 'two' and 'bones' are obviously not singular, only the singular
noun class affixes are used on the numerals. Interestingly, this general­
ization is not true of other Lower Sepik languages like Chambri, which
do employ the non-singular concord markers on numerals. Yimas also
presents a considerable degree of suppletion in its number system, which
will be discussed in the sections on the noun classes in Chapter 4.
The first three numerals are monomorphemic stems which vary for
the class of the noun counted: mpa- 'one', -rpal 'two' and -ramnawt
'three'. 'Four' is derived from the adjective stem rna- 'other' plus the
relevant number/class suffix for dual number reduplicated, i.e., 'other
two and other two' equals 'four'. 'Four' is the one exception to the
rule that only the singular gender class suffixes are used on the Yimas
numerals. So for a class VII noun like tanm 'bone', we have the following
paradigm:
tanm mpa-m
'one bone'
tanpl p-rpal
'two bones'
tanpat p-ramnawt
'three bones'
tanpat ma-mpl+ama-mpl 'four bones'
' Five' is the invariable base tam, while 'six' through 'nine' are formed
from this invariable base plus mawvkwat 'other side' plus 'one' through
' four'. So:
tanpat tam
'five bones'
tanpat tam mawukwat mpa-m 'six bones'
tanpat tam mawukwat p-rpal
'seven bones'102WORD CLASSES'eight bones'
tanpat tam mawJ]kwat p-ramnawt
tanpat tam mawJ]kwat ma-mpl+ama-mpl 'nine bones'
'Ten' is another invariable base: nuvkara-wl hand-DL 'two hands'.
'Eleven' through 'nineteen' are formed from this base plus arm-tap-mpi
jump.down-COMP-SEQ 'and then jump down' plus pamk-n leg-OBL 'on
the leg' plus the numbers 'one' through 'nine'. For example:
nulJkarawl arm-tap-mpi
tanpat
bone VII PL hand DL jump down-COMP-SEQ
pamk-n mpa-m
leg-OBL one-VII
'eleven bones'
tanpat nuJ]karawl armtapmpi pamkn tam maw1Jkwat mpam
'sixteen bones'
tanpat nulJkarawl armtapmpi pamkn tam maw1Jkwat
mamplamampl
'nineteen bones'
'Twenty' is the invariable base namarawt munta-k-n person whole-IRR-1
SG 'a whole person'.
tanpat namarawt muntakn 'twenty bones'
Numbers above 'twenty' are simply 'twenty' plus 'one' through 'nine­
teen'. These higher numerals are in practice never used, Tok Pisin being
the invariable choice here, but the system does make them possible. The
following is acceptable, although I have never heard it spontaneously ut­
tered:
tanpat namarawt muntakn nulJ karawl armtapmpi pamkn tam
mawl]kwat mpam
'thirty-six bones'
Following this logic, 'forty' would be namaraw-rm muntak-rm impu-mpal
person-! DL whole-! DL I DL-two 'two whole men.' The numeral system
can continue producing numbers infinitely with this logic. For higher
numbers, simply divide by base twenty, then base ten, and then base
five, with the remainder realized as 'one' through 'four'. So again the
following is acceptable, but never actually spontaneously said:
muntak-um manpamarm
tanpat
namat
bone VII PL person I PL whole-1 PL four I
nulJ karawl arm-tap-mpi
pamk-n
hand DL jump down-COMP-SEQ leg-OBL
tam maw1Jkwat mamplamampl
five other side four VII
'ninety-nine bones'QUANTIFIERS103Given the extreme complexity of an example like this it is pretty clear
why it is never used: it is far too difficult both to construct and to
process. In a sense this comment applies to the whole numeral system
in Yimas. The complex paraphrases for any number above 'five' and the
great variations in form for numbers below 'five' make the whole system
quite unwieldy. It is not surprising then that as a whole it is giving way
and most younger speakers control it poorly, if at all. These speakers
just substitute the simple numerals of Tok Pisin.
In addition to the cardinal numerals, Yimas possesses a defective
set of ordinal numerals. These only go as far as 'fourth'. The forms
for 'second' through 'fourth' are derived from the cardinal numerals
for classes I and II by suffixing a form -jlawt, except for 'third' which
is derived in the same way from the form for 'three' in classes III
and V.

'fourth' manpamarmputjlawtThe form for 'first' is suppletive; it is kavkran, which also has the
meaning 'before'. 'Last' is expressed by the invariable word nawt,
which in other circumstances expresses 'prototypical, the most com­
mon or typical exemplar of a category, real, true'. For example nawt­
JW1)kun 'prototype-mosquito' refers to the most common ordinary brown
mosquito in the area. This Yimas correlation of 'last' and 'prototypi­
cal' is not too dissimilar from the English ambiguity in the word ulti­
mate. When used specifically in the meaning 'last', nawt is normally
compounded with the cardinal numeral for one mpa-, so the result for
class VII is nawt mpa-m 'last one', 'last'. It is also commonly com­
pounded with the other cardinal numerals to express concepts such as
'the last two'.
nawt p-ral
last VII-two
'the last two'
These ordinal numerals are never inflected with agreement suffixes
for the nouns they modify; they are simply juxtaposed and may occur
on either side of the noun. Further, with the exceptions of kavkran
'first' and nawt 'last', they are restricted to modifying animate, partic­
ularly human, nouns. For inanimate nouns, circumlocutions such as the
following are necessary; compare (a) and (d) with (b) and (c) :WORD CLASSES104kaJJkran wul-k-um

The final type of numerals to consider are the adverbial numbers
'once', 'twice', etc. These are formed for 'three' and above by modifying
the plural noun kvki 'times', belonging to class VI, with the correspond­
ing cardinal numeral.

nate, using the dual form kvkl 'times' plus the proper cardinal number.","[114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"

Other quantifiers in Yimas besides numerals are mpatnpa- 'few.' and
muntak 'many, all'. muntak is invariable, but mpatnpa- varies according
to the noun class of the modified noun by suffixing the plural adjectival
number/class suffixes ( tanpat mpatnpa-ra 'a few bones'). There is also
the interrogative quantifier ntuknti 'how much, how many', which is also
invariable.
3.5 Locationals
Locationals are words which describe the location of an object with re­
spect to that of another object or the speech event. In Yimas there are
two types of locationals: free locationals, corresponding to English lo­
cational adverbs, and locational postpositions, corresponding to English
locational prepositions. Locationals end in n, undoubtedly a fossilized
occurrence of the oblique suffix - n ""' -nan.
Free locationals never occur in the postpositional phrase construction
consisting of a noun plus postposition that is diagnostic of locational
postpositions. Free locationals normally occur as independent words in
a sentence, modifying the copula or a positional verb. Examples of free
locationals are given below:'far'
'near'
'alone'kwantayn
warpayn
tantukwan'left'
'right'pay!Jkan
ampanExamples of their usage are:
(3-23) a. num kwantayn numa-na-pay-n
village far
village S-DEF-lie-PRES
'The village is far.'
warpayn na-na-irm-n
b. taki
stone V SG near
IV SG S-DEF-stand-PRES
'The stone is near.'
While these stems semantically modify nouns, they are not adjectives.
They may never occur with the typical adjectival number/class suffixes,
nor may they precede the head noun in a tightly knit noun phrase.
Closely related in form and behavior to these free locationals and not
too dissimilar in meaning is pawin 'plain, naked, unadorned'. This too
ends in n and occurs as an independent word, modifying a verb. Note
the exact parallelism in these two examples:106WORD CLASSES(3-24) a. panmal tantukwan na-na-aw!Jkcpa-n
man-I SG alone
3SG S-DEF-bathe-PRES
'The man is bathing alone.'
b. panmal pawin na-na-aw!Jkcpa-n
man-I SG naked 3SG S-DEF-bathe-PRES
'The man is bathing naked. '
The stems tantukwan and pawin are not adjectives because they may
never be inflected with the adjectival class/number suffixes. Pawin, but
not tantukwan, does, however, possess one distinctive feature of true
adjectives: it may form a close-knit noun phrase with a following noun,
e.g. , pawin tpuk 'plain sago pancake', 'sago pancake with no meat or
embellishments'. Pawin seems to be a stem intermediate in behavior
between the word classes true adjective and free locational. Its form
and most of its grammatical behavior mark it as a free locational, but
its occurrence in noun phrases indicate that it is a true adjective. Given
that along its full range of meaning, pawin denotes qualities, it is not
surprising that it would take on some adjectival features. A plausible
scenario for the development of pawin would be starting out as a free
locational and gradually being reanalyzed as a member of the adjective
class. It is now in an intermediate stage. Although tantukwan 'alone'
would also seem to English speakers to denote a quality, it is also fairly
easy to see its locational meaning, i.e., something is in a location without
anyone/anything else. This word so far has resisted any move toward
reanalysis as an adjective, as in * tantukwan panmal 'alone man'. Rather
one must say
(3-25) panmal
tantukwan na-na-pay/taw/irm/-n
man I SG alone
3SG S-DEF-lie/sit/stand-PRES
'The man is alone. '
Locational postpositions contrast with free locationals in not always
being independent words. They most commonly occur as postpositions
. to a noun or noun phrase, and in these constructions they require the
noun to be inflected with oblique case suffix -n ""' -nan.
(3-26) a. panmal ya-nan
wampuJlan

"NEIGHBORING LANGUAGES9Southwest of Yimas in the foothills of the central highlands is spoken
the lniai dialect of the Enga language, which in terms of speakers, is the
largest of Papuan languages. This belongs to the Engan language family
and is in most respects typical of the languages of highland New Guinea.
One respect in which Enga diverges from other highland languages, how­
ever, is in the presence of palatal consonants, otherwise uncommon in
the languages of the central highlands. In fact, like Yimas, Enga pos­
sesses a palatalized liquid and a voiceless palatal stop with the usual
allophone [s]. This reflects areal diffusion of a palatal series among the
unrelated languages of the area. Palatals are well established in Enga
and appear to have been inherited from Proto-Engan (Franklin 1975).
Enga contrasts with both Yimas and Arafundi in that it has a voiced
series of stops (including one in the palatal position), which are always
prenasalized. In Yimas such sequences are best analyzed as nasal plus
stop clusters, but in Enga they are unit phonemes. Enga also lacks
the high central vowel so characteristic of Sepik languages generally and
Yimas in particular. Rather it has the standard five-vowel system of
highlands languages.
Morphologically, Enga fits the general highlands pattern. As in Ara­
fundi, nouns are not inflected for gender or number, but they are in­
flected for case, and rather richly so: Enga has seven distinct case suf­
fixes, including an ergative. One area is which Enga does parallel Yimas
is in the marking of a possessor. Both languages use a remarkably sim­
ilar form: Yimas na, Enga - nya. Enga verbs are like those of Arafundi
and contrast with those of Yimas in that they are nearly exclusively
suffixing (there is only one prefix, the negative, in the entire language).
Verbal suffixes in Enga mark tense and the person and number of the
subject, but unlike the situation in Arafundi, there is no object suffix.
A further feature shared with Arafundi is that the subject suffixes do
not distinguish between second- and third-person in the non-singular
numbers. While there is some variation in form of the subject suffixes
due to tense variation, they clearly are all derived from a single form
(Lang 1973) ( l-e-6 say-FR PAST-1SG S 'I said long ago', lli-p-u say-NR
PAST-1SG S 'I said', le-ly-o say-PRES-1SG S 'I am saying'). Finally,
Enga makes heavy use of morphologically distinct dependent verb forms
and switch-reference morphology (Lang 1973).

"384INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSThe verb in (7-20a) lacks any valence decreasing affix so, being a bivalent
verb, it must be associated with two core arguments, an A n- 3SG A and
an 0 na- 3SG 0. The contrastive pronoun panawt 'self' must be linked
to the A participant above, deriving the meaning 'he killed him himself'.
The verb in the reflexive example (7-2b), while semantically bivalent, is
formally intransitive. Further, pan- is marked with the oblique suffix so
may not function as a core argument. Thus, the single core argument
m-n 'he' is an S acting on himself, and hence the reflexive reading of the
construction.
As can be gleaned from the preceding examples, these contrastive
pronouns only mark gender and number. Person must be expressed
through an appositional independent pronoun or deictic ( mi pan-mav
2SG self-F SG 'you, yourself'; kapa pan-mampan-an lDL self-M DL-OBL
'both of us, ourselves'; m-um pan-put NR DIST-Il PL self-F PL 'those,
themselves'). The pronoun or deictic can be left out if the referent is
clear from the immediate context, and in any case, deictics are commonly
omitted with the contrastive pronouns. If a contrastive pronoun occurs
alone (7-18b), it is normally interpreted as third person unless contextual
features determine otherwise.
Complementation
Complementation is one of the most interesting and elaborated parts of
Yimas grammar, and is remarkably different in a number of ways from
the system of complements in many other languages, including other
Papuan languages. Complements are not all that common in Yimas
formal narrative discourse, but in everyday speech and conversation they
are frequently encountered.
Complements in Yimas are typically nominalizations and are formed
with - ru NFN. In other words, in order for a clause (the complement) to
function as an argument of another clause (the main or matrix clause),
it must be made non-finite through the process of nominalization. Com­
plement nominalizations are like nouns and nominals generally in being
affixed with suffixes to mark noun class; we have already seen this with
the suffixes - awt M SG, etc. It is these class suffixes which indicate the
different types of complements. In addition to the agentive nominaliza­
tions marked by - awt M SG, etc., there are four types of complements in
Yimas: complements of speech or language, marked by -mpwi; comple­
ments of desire (-wampuv ) , complements of action (-nti), and comple­
ments of customary action (-wal) . The semantics of each type will be
discussed below, but first I wish to present the general syntactic features
of Yimas complementation structures.
The first point about Yimas nominalized complements is that they
7.1.2NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS385have the basic syntactic structure of compounds. Remember that Yimas
possesses a productive means of forming verb plus noun compounds
using the - t allomorph of -ru NFN (see Section 4.4).
(7-21) a. ayk-t
yaw
yua-0
yak
marry-NFN road IX SG good-IX SG COP IX SG
'That's a proper match of marriage partners.'
tpuk
ku-n-kacapal
b. am-t
eat-NFN sago pancake X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot his sago for eating.'
The compounds in (7-21) are very close to complements. If we replace
the head noun of the compound in (7-21b) with complement markers
and specifically that of the complement of desire, - wampuv (nothing but
the class V noun meaning 'heart'), we derive a parallel complementation
structure of almost morpheme-for-morpheme similarity.
na-n-kacapal
(7-22) tpuk
am-tu-wampu:u
sago pancake )\ SG eat-NFN-heart V SG V SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He lost interest in eating sago.'
In (7-22) the head noun of the compound is wampuv 'heart', the indi­
cator of a complement of desire. This is what is marked on the verb as
the 0 participant by na- V SG 0, the class and number specifications
for wampuv 'heart'.
It is also possible for class markers by themselves to function as the
heads of verb plus noun compounds either with or without an overt
coreferential noun.
(7-23) a. tpuk
am-t-u:u
ku-n-kacapal
sago pancake X SG eat-NFN-X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot his sago for eating.'
b. am-t-u:u
ku-n-kacapal
eat-NFN-X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forgot
'He forgot his (sago) for eating.'
Example (7-23a) differs from (7-21b) in that the order of verb plus noun
has been altered, changing the embedding structure of modifier plus
head to one of two appositional nominals of the same class and number,
the second being headed by the class marker -uv X SG. This alternation
is no different from that involving possessors or adjectives.
(7-24) a. ama-na matn
1SG-POSS brother I SG
versus
ama-na-kn
matn
brother I SG 1SG-POSS-I SG
'my brother'INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS386b. kpa kay
big canoe VIII SG
versuskay
kpa-y
canoe VIII SG big-VIII SG
'a big canoe'
Example (b) in (7-23) is simply the second nominal in the appositional
arrangement of (7-23a) standing on its own. This clause would be used
whenever the context makes it clear what referent denoted by a class
X SG noun is being talked about (expressed by the suffix - uv X SG),
just as kpa-y big-VIII SG would generally be all that is necessary in a
discourse about canoes.
The examples in (7-23) are again very closely paralleled by comple­
ment structures.
(7-25) a. tpuk
am-tu-mpwi pia-n-kacapal
sago pancake X SG eat-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot to eat sago.'
b. am-tu-mpwi pia-n-kacapal
eat-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot to eat.'
In (7-25) the class marker - mpwi 'talk' is used to mark a nominalized
complement of speech; the complements could express the A partici­
pant's thoughts (thoughts are regarded as internal speech in Yimas), or
could paraphrase an order or exhortation directed to the A which was
forgotten. The class marker -mpwi 'talk' functions as the head of these
nominalized complements, so that in fact they have the syntactic struc­
ture of verb plus noun compounds. Since compounds have the following
syntactic structure,
(7-26)
N
---- ----s---- ---V
I
INNmawrun
enemyi!]kay
tu-t
kill-NFN
spear-V PL
'spears for killing enemies'
nominalized complements can be represented in rather the same way.
The complement in (7-22) has the structure (7-27), and (7-25) that of
(7-28).","[399, 400, 401, 402]"
"INTERJECTIONS117Note that mnta occurs following kaput 'black palm', the object of the
second clause it is conjoining. If, as in most cases, the two clauses just
consist of verbs, mnta will occur between them:
(3-37) ya-n-kaprak-t
mnta ya-n-am-t
V PL 0-3SG A-cut up-PERF then V PL 0-3SG A-eat-PERF
'He cut (the food) up and then ate it.'
Clause boundaries are sometimes difficult to determine with these
conjunctions. If a nominal is shared by the two conjoined clauses, the
conjunctions will often follow it, especially if it is oblique.

For more discussion of the grammar of conjunctions, see Section
7.3.2.
3.10 Interjections
Interjections are a small class of uninflected words used to express emo­
tional states or reactions, yes or no, or greetings. The following are
interjections in Yimas:
yaw
'yes'
kayak
'no'
ay
'wow, really, heh, what!'
aw
'hello, farewell' (social greeting)
apa
'OK'
Interjections typically form an utterance by themselves, constituting a
separate intonation group.","[132, 133]"
"THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS229As the A prefix is plural, the plural vaykum 'women' is linked to it and
interpreted as the A. The singular D prefix then links to the singular
noun panmal 'man' which assumes a D participant relation. Note that
if there was no number distinction between these two nouns, the clause
would be ambiguous.
(5-66) :uaykum
makaw
payum
woman II PL fish (sp) IX SG man I PL
wa-mpu-:ua-r-mpun
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'The men gave the women makau.'
'The women gave the men makau. '
As mentioned previously, the word order among noun phrases is free, so
that it does not play a role in disambiguating this clause. Taken out of
context, it must remain ambiguous.
It must be emphasized again that it is the pronominal affixes which
fill the argument positions of the verb, not the noun phrases, and these
latter only receive a participant role interpretation by being in a parat­
actic relationship with a pronominal affix of the same categorical speci­
fications. Given this fact, it is not surprising that in the large majority
of Yimas clauses in ongoing discourse, there are no independent noun
phrases at all. The participant roles are simply filled by the pronominal
affixes; so the following then correspond to (5-65a,b) :
( 5-67) a. ya-mpu-yamal-wat
VIII PL 0-3PL A-carve-HAB
'They usually carve them.'
b. wa-mpu-:ua-r-akn
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'They gave it to them. '
These Yimas verbs would be used in contexts very similar to those of
their English clausal translations: when the referents of the pronomi­
nal affixes had been established in the discourse or context. The noun
phrases are suppressed and their referents tracked simply by the pronom­
inal affixes in Yimas, as the pronouns do in English. However, because
of the difference in grammatical status between the Yimas pronominal
affixes and the English pronouns, and because of the great range of dis­
tinctions made in its affixes, through the systems of noun class, person,
and number, Yimas allows much greater latitude in this feature than
English. For example, in some recitations of traditional legends, impor­
tant props and characters are not introduced through overt nouns, but
only with pronominal affixes. It seems to be assumed that the story line230BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYand characters are so familiar and well known that that is all that is
necessary. Also, the established, old information status of a participant
may persist much longer in Yimas discourse than in English. For exam­
ple, in the Yimas creation legend, there is an important prop which is
introduced and then ignored for a reasonably long stretch of discourse,
about 3 pages; it is then reintroduced, but only through the use of its
corresponding pronominal prefix! This is because, being class VII dual,
a relatively rare combination, there is no chance of confusion with any
other referent. English with its undifferentiated it is too impoverished
morphologically to allow this kind of free pronominalization over such a
long stretch of discourse.
An interesting difference between Yimas and English in this area
concerns translation strategies. I have very often been surprised by the
frequency with which Yimas speakers reference a participant simply by
a pronominal prefix when asked to translate a sentence from Tok Pisin.
For example, when asking for a translation of the Tok Pisin version of
'I bought betelnut', one may very well get:
(5-68) na-ka-wayk-t
V SG 0- lSG A-buy-PERF
'I bought it'
in which na- V SG 0 is the only overt indication of the class V singular
noun patn 'betelnut'. I have made no study of this, but I conjecture that
if English speakers were asked to translate the same Tok Pisin sentence
into English it is highly unlikely the noun would be omitted. I believe
this again reflects the basic difference between these pronominal affixes
and English pronouns: the pronominal affixes fill the argument slots of
the verb, and a clause is complete with just them. The noun phrases
are indirectly and paratactically linked to the verb through these affixes.
They may be omitted freely if they correspond to established referents.
On the other hand, in English the noun phrases themselves, whether
they be nouns or pronouns, fill these argument slots of the verb. So in
parroting back a clause in translation, it is straightforward and expected
that the speaker will simply repeat the nouns of the prompt sentence,
given that the noun phrase positions of an English clause must be filled
if it is to be complete.
An additional argument for regarding the affixes as filling the verbal
argument positions concerns the indication of paucal number. Paucal
number is predominantly a verbal category; with the exception of the
pronouns and deictics for humans, no noun phrases exhibit overt inflec­
tion for paucal, i.e., the plural number covers the range of paucal as well.
Consider the following example:THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS231(5-69) namat

Assuming that the pronominal affixes fill the argument positions, this
example is easy to analyze. The A prefix vkl- 3PL A is third person
and paucal. Searching for a noun phrase which shares these features
we come across the class I plural noun namat 'men'. Knowing that the
equation paucal = plural holds for all nouns, we conclude that namat
'men' is linked to vkl- 3PL A, and it is interpreted to function in the A
role.
Now consider an analysis with the opposite assumption: that the
noun phrases really fill argument slots of the verb and the pronominal
affixes are just automatic copies of these onto the verb. Example (569) now becomes problematic because namat is morphologically plural
and should therefore be copied by the plural A prefix, mpu-. One could
argue, of course, that namat is actually specified as paucal, and that it
just happens that paucal and plural are homophonous. But this seeming
harmless coincidence happens throughout the language: no Yimas noun
distinguishes paucal from plural number. This analysis requires us to
posit a morphological category for Yimas nouns which never has any
overt realization for them. The previous analysis, with the pronominal
prefixes only filling argument positions, has no such requirement and is
therefore to be preferred.
Still another piece of evidence concerns verbal pronominal prefixes
with conjoint reference. Consider this example:
impa-wa-ntut
( 5-70) panmal
narma!J
man I SG woman II SG 3DL S-go-RM PAST
'The man and woman went . '
I have already presented arguments that Yimas does not permit nounphrases composed of conjoined nouns in Section 4.6. Hence panmal
'man' and narmav 'woman' cannot form a constituent in this example
to trigger the dual number specification for the S prefix on the verb
impa- 3 DL S. Rather this is specified independently and fills the S ar­
p;ument position for this verb. This is then linked to both singular nouns
paratactically, integrating both of them to fill out the dual specification
of the S prefix.
A final argument concerns the phenomenon of possessor raising to
he discussed in detail in Section 6.2.3.2. In this construction, a human
possessor of a core argument of the verb is promoted to function in its
own right as a core argument marked by a D affix.","[244, 245, 246, 247]"

Interestingly, Yimas allows non-finite nominalizations rather like
agentive nominalizations to be formed for locationals. These are identi­
cal in form to other non-finite nominalizations except that they require
the concord marker - a IX SG and the oblique suffix. These describe a
place which exists specifically for the purpose of performing the action
described by the relative clause, as in these examples:
(7-106) a. awukcpau-t-a-n

'bathing place'

by adding it to Tok Pisin words, new Yimas verb roots are
derived.)

These finite relative clauses without m- NR DIST quite commonly
function alone without being linked as a modifier to any other noun in428INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSthe clause. This has led in some cases to their being re-analyzed as noun
stems.
(7-107) wa-n [amp-0-ra]
yara-k
go-IMP kindle-PERF-V PL pick up-IRR
'Go collect firewood!'
The main verb in this example is in the imperative mood, yet the tense of
the nominalization is perfective. These two are contradictory, of course,
the imperative corresponding to actions yet to be done, and the perfec­
tive to those already completed. This contradiction is possible simply
because nominalizations like ampra 'firewood' or amtra 'food' are now
nouns in their own right and are no longer seen as the result of a pro­
ductive nominalization process, rather like the dead in English.
The only relative clauses without m- NR DIST which commonly do
have an overt modified 'head' noun are those functioning like English
adjectives to express qualities or states. As pointed out in Sections 3.3
and 6.2.3.1.3, most Yimas roots corresponding to English adjectives are
actually verbs denoting processes, the so-called adjectival verbs. When
these translate English adjectives, i.e., denote states or qualities, they
are nothing but these m- less finite relative clauses, most commonly
found with the tense suffix -k IRR to describe an unbounded temporal
duration, although other tense suffixes are possible (7-108c).

A final point to consider here is the meaning contrast associated with
the presence versus absence of m- NR DIST in finite relative clauses. The

trate the contrast, consider (7-109a,b), diagrammed as (7-llOa,b):

Finite relative clauses with m- NR DIST are obligatorily associated with
a definite, established, modified 'head' noun as their referent, while those
without m- are not, often having a vague class of referents as possi­
ble referents (e.g., means of going (7-105d)). This is, of course, fully
in keeping with the presence versus absence of the definite near distal
stem. Further, a finite relative clause with m- often has established nom­
inal participants, reflected in the verbal pronominal affixes, while those
without m- never do. They obligatorily lack all expression of nominal
participants, either as independent words or pronominal affixes.
A common use of finite relative clauses with m- NR DIST is in cleft
constructions. These are equational sentences in which certain identify­
ing or descriptive features of a focused noun are provided by a relative
clause. The semantics of clefts thus prohibits them from occurring with
relative clauses without m- NR DIST. English examples are it was John
who shea·red the sheep and John was the one who sheared the sheep.
Yimas clefts consist of a noun ph1H a modifying relative clause plus an430INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSoptional copula. The relative clauses in both Yimas and English clefts
present information which is already known or presumed from the con­
text of the speech act. The function of a cleft construction is to use this
information to identify the proper referent of the noun of the cleft or
at least to predicate something important and relevant about it. Thus
the relative clause in both examples, who sheared sheep, provides rele­
vant information about the head noun of these cleft constructions, John.
Yimas clefts are exactly parallel.

Clefts are important in Yimas because they play a central role in
content questions, otherwise known as wh questions. Note that in ques­
tions like Who sheared the sheep? or What did he shear the sheep with?,
the action of shearing sheep is presupposed and established and what is
at issue is who did the action or what was used to perform it. Thus, the
pragmatic force of the non- wh component of these questions is identical
to that of a relative clause in a cleft, and so it is really no surprise that
some wh questions in Yimas take the forms of clefts. If the wh word
is functioning as S, then a cleft construction is obligatory; to use an
ordinary clause structure is ungrammatical.

The pronominal prefix nan- is homophonous for 2SG 0 and 2PL A. The

ranked third person dual participant must be indicated by the dual num­
ber suffix -rm regardless of whether it is A (5-106d, i) or 0 (5-106d, ii) .
These examples of transitive verbs again bring up the question of the
accusative-ergative split according to person. If we compare intransitive
and transitive negative verbs having first and second person participants,
we find that the S argument is indicated by the same prefix form as the
A argument, a clear nominative-accusative participant role alignment.","[271, 272]"
"204BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYHere al 'machete' functions as the instrument responsible for the cutting.
There is no responsible agent mentioned in the sentence, so it is the
instrument which is coded by the A prefix. Note that although the 0
is animate and the A inanimate, the A still occurs closer to the verb
stem, in the higher ranking position. Now consider the following two
examples:
kay
(5-23) a. arm i-mpu-tal-c1Jknt-t

'The water made the canoe heavy. '
b. ikn
antki
smoke V SG thatch VII PL
ya-n-tar-urkpwica-t
VII PL 0-3SG A-CADS-blacken-PERF
'The smoke blackened the roof (thatch) .'
It is worth pointing out that arm 'water', which constitutes a noun
class by itself and is normally referenced by an S/0 verbal prefix ima-,
is treated as a plural noun when an A argument and indicated by the
third plural A prefix mpu-. In both examples, the verbs are overtly
causative, as expressed by the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- (see Section
6.2.3.1.3), and the inanimate nouns which express the forces functioning
as the causes are referenced by the corresponding A prefix. While con­
structions like those of (5-23) are certainly grammatical in Yimas, such
constructions with an overtly causativized verb have an alternative in
which the verb is intransitive and associated with an S argument express­
ing the entity undergoing the change of state and an oblique noun for the
causing force. So compare the examples in (5-23) to the corresponding
intransitive examples in (5-24) :
(5-24) a. arm-n
kay
i-cJJknt-t
water-OBL canoe VIII SG VIII SG S-heavy-PERF
'The canoe got heavy from the water.'
b. ikn-an
antki
ya-urkpwica-t
smoke-OBL thatch VII PL VII PL S-blacken-PERF
'The roof (sago thatch) blackened from the smoke.'
These later constructions obviate the need to code the inanimate causers
with an A prefix, instead marking them as peripheral nouns with the
oblique suffix. The constructions of both (5-23) and (5-24) are equally
grammatical and there is no significant meaning difference between
them, although perhaps the examples (5-23) , in which the causing func­
tions are marked as A, reflect a more direct causation, focusing on theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS205causer, rather than the change of state. This seems to be true of the
corresponding English translations.
Having now discussed in some detail verbs associated with two third
person participants, let me turn to the next most straightforward cases,
those with one third person participant and one first or second person
participant. According to principle one, the first or second person par­
ticipant outranks the third person, so it must occupy the position closer
to the verb stem. Now the second principle must be considered: A out­
ranks 0 for third person, but 0 outranks A for first and second. So if
the A is third person and the 0 is first or second, there is no conflict
between the two principles: the first or second person 0 will occupy the
ranking position closer to the verb stem, and the third person A will
precede it.

3SG A-lPL O-see
'He saw us. '
p-ua-kra-t
d . naukm
grass VII SG VII SG A- lSG 0-cut-PERF
'The grass cut me.'
Note that because of the constraints on the form of the third person
prefixes imposed by linear order, the third person A's in these examples
actually appear in the form for S and 0, the only permissible form for
initial position. Also, because the A prefix must occur initially in an
S /0 form, it is now possible to indicate the noun class of inanimate
A 's as in (5-25d). This is not possible for verbs with two third person
participants, in which the A prefix must be the A form in the ranking
H«'cond position (5-23) .
If the A is first or second person and the 0 third person, the two
principles for ranking are now in conflict with each other. In this situ­
ation, principle one provides, and the first or second person participant
occupies the higher ranked position, even though it is an A (compare
t.lwse with examples in (5-25)) :

c. na-kay-cay
3SG 0-lPL A-see
'We saw him. '
Now let us turn to the most complex cases, verbs with a first person
participant and a second person participant. By principle one, the first
person participant, will always outrank the second. But principle two
poses a potential dilemma. Remember that for first and second persons
0 outranks A, so that if the first person participant is the 0 and the
second person the A, there is no problem: both principles select the
same participant, the first person 0, as the higher ranked. If, on the
other hand, the first person participant is the A and the second person
the 0, the two principles are in conflict: principle one selects the first
person A as the higher ranked, while principle two chooses the second
person 0. As we shall see below, Yimas has evolved a clever solution to
this dilemma.
Let us start with the simpler of the two cases, that in which the
principles are in harmony. These involve a first person 0 and a second
person A. By both principles the higher ranked will be the first person
0, and therefore the prefix for this participant will occur closer to the
verb stem:
( 5-27) a. ma-IJa-tay
2SG A-lSG O-see
'You saw me. '
b . ma-kra-tay
2SG A-lPL O-see
'You saw us.'
c. kapwa-IJkra-tay
2DL A-lDL O-see
'You two saw us two.'
d. ipwa-IJkra-tay
2PL A-lDL O-see
'You all saw us two.'
Because the second person A is the lower ranked participant, it would
have to appear in the verb-initial position. But as we have seen with
third person prefixes, there is a constraint which prohibits the A prefix
forms from appearing there. Hence, the second person A is actually real­
ized with the S prefix form, as with the third person examples discussed
earlier. For example, in ( 5-27a,b) , the second singular A is marked byTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS207the prefix ma- 2SG S. The same constraint causes the S prefixes for non­
singular second person participants to be employed in examples (5-27c,
d), although in these cases it is a little more difficult to be sure that
there are in fact bound S prefixes, for they are completely homophonous
with the independent pronouns. Evidence that there are in fact bound
prefixes will be presented below in Section 5.1.4 on paucal marking and
again in Section 5.2.2.1 on negation.
Let us now look at the case in which the two principles fixing the lin­
ear order of A and 0 prefixes are in conflict, those involving a first person
A and a second person 0. By principle one, the first person A should
be the higher ranked, but by principle two, the second person 0 should
be. For a second person singular 0, the language avoids the problem en­
tirely by having a suppletive portmanteau morpheme mpan- ""' kampan­
(whose allomorph occurs word-initially) which is used whenever a first
person A of any number acts on a second singular 0.
(5-28) a. kampan-tay

b. kapa kampan-tay
lDL 1A/2SG O-see
'We two saw you.'
c. ipa kampan-tay
lPL 1A/2SG O-see
'We saw you.'
To distinguish the number of the first person A, an independent pronoun
must be used, as in (5-28b, c). Without a pronoun, first singular is
assumed, unless context determines otherwise (5-28a).
If the second person 0 is non-singular, the language copes by simply
prohibiting both participants from being realized as bound prefixes to
the verb. The second person 0 occupies the ranking position of the prefix
to the verb, and the first person A must appear as an independent pro­
noun. These independent pronouns are, of course, again homophonous
with the corresponding S prefixes (as with the examples of the non­
H ingular second person A's in (5-27c, d), but in this situation the first
JH�rson A's are flatly prohibited from being bound to the verb).

'Did you all hear the slit drum down below?'
The use of -kia with imperatives as in (5-84a) clearly demonstrates that
it may not be a tense morpheme, for imperatives are tenseless. Rather,
this command and the expected action were performed at night so that
-kia is used. The verb of (5-85b) is marked with the habitual suffix
-wat, but this action, sleeping, is one that is normally done at night,
so again the suffix -kia is present. (5-84c) is drawn from a traditional
legend and exhibits the typical usage of the irrealis -k in such texts. But
this sentence occurs at a particular point in the text when the scene
switches from day to night. Thus, the suffix -kia now appears, although
it was not used in the previous sentences of the text. Note that -kia
is not only used on the main verb, but also occurs on the preceding
nonfinite purpose clause, again demonstrating that it is not strictly a
tense morpheme. Finally, consider the last example (5-84d). This comes
from a story describing events which occurred a year previously, hence
the use of - ntut RM PAST. The particular event of (5-84d) occurred
at night, so -kia is used, while in most of the other sentences in the
text, which describe daytime events, it is absent. (There is yet a further
specialized use of -kia with - ntut RM PAST, which does not actually
specify night time, but functions to express far past, i.e., events from
the day before yesterday and back. This will be discussed in detail in
Section 5.2.1.3.2.)
5.2.1.3 The Past Tenses
5.2.1.3.1 The Remote Past. The remote past occurs in two basic allo­
rnorphs -ntut and - ntuk, the former in word-final position and the latter
elsewhere. Both allomorphs are subject to the truncation rule (rule (21 5)) which deletes the initial nasal when the previous morpheme ends in
a nasal ( klv- 'cut and dispose of' + - ntut RM PAST > klvtut or am- 'con­
sume' + - ntut RM PAST > amtut ) . Both allomorphs are, of course, also
subject to the palatalization rule (rule (2-3)) if the previous morpheme
Pnds in a segment with the F autosegment, as in tay- 'see' + - ntut RM
PAST > tapcut or awl- 'get' + - ntut RM PAST > awtpcut (the second
Pxample also illustrates rule (2-5), liquid strengthening) . The non-final
allomorph - ntuk always triggers R spreading into a following V. The
final /k/ of this allomorph is subject to loss before the paucal suffix
- vkt, as in - ntuk RM PAST + -vkt PC > - ntuvkut (by /k/ loss and R
Hpreading) .
The remote past is used to describe events in the continuum of real
t i me, but most removed from the present now. The actual time span242BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYwhich it covers, however, is quite sensitive to contextual differences.
Minimally, an event must be five days removed from today, but even
events of a few years or more ago may be presented in the far past,
rather than the remote past, if they seem especially near, important, or
vivid to the narrator. Perhaps the best way to describe the time span
covered by the remote past is as the period between the far past , which
covers relatively near or vivid past events, and the legendary past, which
is outside of real time and is best expressed via the irrealis. It is not
uncommon for texts to begin in the remote past, but to switch in mid­
stream to either the irrealis or the far past, depending on the pragmatic
effects the speaker wishes to achieve. The irrealis distances the events
further, making them timeless, while the far past brings them closer to
the present and makes them more vivid.
A couple of examples of the use of the remote past follow:
(5-86) a. rna

'Before flying foxes always hung from the underneath of

5.2.1.3.2 The Far Past. The far past is used for events viewed as closer in
time or more vivid than those expressed in the remote past. It is formed
by compounding -kia with the remote past, thus -kiantut ""' -kiantuk,
and the latter is subject to the same phonological rules as the remote
past allomorph - ntuk.
The first and most obvious question concerning -kiantut FR PAST is
why is it formed with the suffix -kia? This again finds an explanation
of the traditional Yimas reckoning of the day from sunset to sunset.
Remember that any given night is always the same day as the following
noon. Hence any previous night in the past is actually in a time period
closer to the present now than is the day preceding that night. Hence
the re-analysis of -kia-ntut NIGHT-RM PAST to CLOSER-RM PAST >
FR PAST finds a ready explanation.
The far past -kiantut ""' -kiantuk covers past events from the day be­
fore yesterday to a year or even a few years ago. The boundary betweenTENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD243the remote past and the far past is vague and is exploited by speak­
ers for stylistic effect. The use of the remote past distances the events
in time and feeling, while the far past brings them closer, enhancing
them and adding a more vivid coloring. Thus, events of two years ago
could quite easily be narrated in either the remote or far past, but with
these pragmatic, stylistic differences noted. Interestingly, -kia can also
be used with -k IRR when this replaces the remote past in legends and
myths. Again this provides a closer, more vivid coloring to the events
thus presented. Examples involving the far past follow:
( 5-87) a. paJJkra-kwalca-mpi-cu-JJka-pu-kiantu-JJkt

'We few got up and went outside.'
b. trawsistm
tma-mpu-JJa-JJa-kiantut
trousers V DL V DL T-3PL A-ISG 0-give-FR PAST
'They gave me two pairs of trousers.'
5.2.1.3.3 The Near Past. The near past is that with the most clearly
defined temporal limits: it marks events which occurred yesterday. If
one is talking at noon about an event which occurred on the previous
noon, that event will always be presented in the near past. But because
of the conflict between the traditional Yimas reckoning of a day from
sunset to sunset and the modern English/Tok Pisin based one of sunrise
to sunrise, there is some confusion about last night and the night before
last. Generally, a speaker talking at noon about events of the previous
night will describe them as occurring during (kwarkwa) wut ' ( today)
night' and will use the perfective suffix on the verb, equivalent to a
present tense suffix for events which have already occurred today. This
is the expected result if the day is calculated from sunset to sunset.
There are, however, some younger speakers who follow the sunrise to
sunrise pattern and will describe such events as occurring during varv
wut ' I day removed night', but they will still use the perfective suffix on
the verb. The near past in this usage is completely unacceptable by all
speakers.
The night before last is more problematic, and younger speakers
are unsure as to whether to describe it as varv wut ' I day removed
night' or urakrv wut '2 days removed night', although older speakers
more consistently used varv wut ' I day removed night'. All speakers use
the far past, rather than the expected near past to describe this time
period. The near past is never used to describe events which occur red

5.2.1.4 The Present Tenses
The present tense covers events which have occurred or are occurring
today or could occur on any day including today (i.e., habitual actions).
Because of the traditional reckoning of the day from sunset to sunset,
when a speaker is talking at noon about events which are fully expected
to occur in the coming night, these are always expressed in the near
future, the tense of tomorrow, which, of course, commences with the
coming sunset. Generally, events of the previous night are described in
the present tense. Strictly speaking, there is no straightforward present
tense morpheme in Yimas; rather there are three different aspectual cat­
egories expressed within the overall present tense category: perfective,
imperfective, and habitual.
5.2.1.4.1 The Perfective. This marks events which have already occurred
and been completed during today, including last night. It may also
occasionally be used to mark completed events, especially changes of
state, when the time of completion is unknown or irrelevant. Because
last night is the same day as today according to the traditional Yimas
reckoning, this is the inflection typically used to describe events which
occurred then. If one is speaking at noon about events of last night one
would simply use wut 'night' plus the perfective. The night suffix -kia
is never used in combination with the perfective.
The basic form of the perfective is -r, but it is subject to extensive
allomorphic variation. In word-final position it is realized as t by the
rule of final r strengthening (rule (2-4)). Thus, wu- 'take in hand' +
-r PERF > wut. The perfective is also realized in non-final position as
t if the previous syllable contains a /r/ by the rule of r dissimilation
(rule (2-6) ) as follows: kra- 'cut' + -r PERF + - akn 3SG D > kratakn.
The perfective has the allomorph 0 in word-final position following the
palatalizing segments /i/, /1/, and /y/ ( awl- 'get' + -r PERF > awl; and
tay- 'see' + -r PERF > tay). This is probably the result of a prohibition
on /c/ in word-final position, as this would be the expected realization.","[256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"

'with'The branches directly off S can be rotated and shifted around freely with
no change in meaning, but this is not true of the next level of branches,
those corresponding to the phrasal units and the V. We have already
seen that the internal structure of the V is highly complex and hierar­
chically ordered. It may be that the very simple structure of the clause
level in Yimas compensates for the highly elaborate structure at lower
levels, especially inside the V. It is a commonplace among modern lin­
guistic theories that internal hierarchical structure is a universal feature
of language. This may be true, but languages like Yimas demonstrate
that such a structure need not be manifested at the clause level, where
it is commonly expected, but may show up elsewhere, where it is less
expected, for example, in the internal structure of the words. It may be
a truism that polysynthetic languages like Yimas choose to elaborate the
internal structure of words in contradistinction to phrases and clauses.
If one glances back at the phrase structure rules in (6-189) and (6194), an obvious generalization about Yimas emerges: the heads of con­
structions always occur to their right. The question then arises as to
what is the head of a clause. The only obligatory constituent of a clause
is, of course, the verb, and the rightmost obligatory constituent of a
verb is the tense morpheme. I suggest then that we consider TNS as the
head of its clause. In other words, as a noun phrase is defined by its
head noun and a postpositional phrase by its head postposition, so is
the category S defined by the tense morpheme.",[392]
"Evidence that the non-singular second person A's in (5-29c, d) are bound
to the verbs, but that these first person A's are not is presented in
the discussion of negation (see Section 5.2.2.1). As (5-29a) shows, a
first singular A is assumed in the absence of an overt pronoun. These
examples indicate that in the conflict between principles one and two for
the ordering of the first and second person A and 0 prefixes, the second
is the more important, for it is the 0 which is realized as the verbal
prefix, as principle two would require, in spite of the fact that it is the
lower ranking participant by principle one.
5.1.3 Ditransitive Verbs and the Expression of the Dative
So far I have been using the notions of transitive and intransitive in a
descriptive and rather pre-theoretical manner. As we shall see in Section
5.1.6, these notions are not without their problems when applied to Yi­
mas, but for the time being I will continue to use them as I have defined
above. In addition to the many intransitive and transitive verbs, Yimas
has four inherently ditransitive verbs, although many basic transitive
verbs can be made ditransitive through the valence increasing prefixes
(see Section 6.2.3). These four basic ditransitive verbs are va- 'give', i­
'tell someone', tkam- 'show', and pul- 'rub on'. Ditransitive verbs are
distinctive in Yimas by allowing three pronominal affixes, the third one
being used to express what is called in traditional grammar the indirect
object or dative case, as boy in the girl gave the snake to the boy. The
range of this third affix in Yimas is much wider than simply the indirect
object in English and corresponds to many uses of the dative case in
classical languages like Latin, so I will refer to these affixes as the dative
affixes (abbreviation: D). For first and second person, these dative af­
fixes are, in fact, homophonous with the 0 prefixes, but for third person
there is a distinct set of dative suffixes.
(5-30) a. ura!J
k-mpu-va-tkam-t
coconut VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-lSG D-show-PERF
'They showed me the coconut.'
b. ura!J
k-mpu-tkam-r-mpn
coconut VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-show-PERF-3DL D
'They showed them two the coconut. '
Note that the dative affixes are the same as the 0 forms only in the
first and second persons, the persons that align participant roles ac­
cording to a nominative-accusative schema. In the third person forms,THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS209which follow an ergative-absolutive alignment, the dative suffixes are
distinct from both the A and 0 prefix forms. This suggests that the
first and second persons follow not so much a nominative-accusative
schema, as a nominative-dative one, in accord with Silverstein's (1976,
1980) claim of the underlying salience of the nominative-dative case op­
position. Although the 0 and D prefixes for first and second person
are homophonous, they must be regarded as distinct because of their
different substitution possibilities: 0 prefixes by third person absolutive
prefixes and D prefixes by third person dative suffixes. This claim is
further buttressed by their behavior in relativization (see Section 7.2.1).
The data on the verbal pronominal suffixes presented so far demon­
strates a fundamental split between the first and second persons on the
one hand and third person on the other. First and second person have
a three way split between S, A, and 0, with D equivalent formally to
0. This is of course, underlaid by a nominative-accusative system (or
nominative-dative) with S = A and opposed to 0 /D. Third person forms
exhibit an ergative-absolutive system with S = 0 opposed to A and with
a distinct D series. The differences between the persons can be summa­
rized as follows:
D
S
A
0
IJa1/2 kaama-mpn
impa3 mpiIn the accusatively marking persons 0 collapses with D, but in the erga­
tively marking person, it collapses with S. Is there a unified notion of 0
that lies behind these different encodings? This question parallels the
earlier one whether there is a unified notion of subject underneath the
nominative-accusative/ergative-absolutive split based on person. Both
questions are far too complex to answer completely here, and data bear­
i ng on them will be continually presented when I treat the syntax of
clauses and complex sentences in Chapters 6 and 7. The vast major­
ity of syntactic processes in Yimas are realized through morphological
devices, and the grammatical relations involved in these processes are
those reflected in the morphology. Hence when the morphology reflects
this person-based split, there is scant evidence to support the claim of
a unity underlying that split. There are, however, a few syntactic con­
Htructions which do provide evidence for unified notions of subject and
object, and this will be noted when they are discussed. But at this point
I will stick closely to the various categories that the morphology justifies.
Now let me return to the examples in (5-30). Even though I have
n�jected the idea of a morphologically coherent notion of 0 for ditran­
H it.ive verbs, equivalent to the 0 of transitive verbs, I can still proposeBASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY210rather straightforward analyses. In (5-30a), the verb tkam 'show' is as­
sociated with three core arguments. The initiating participant, the A,
is third person plural and is realized by the proper prefix mpu- 3PL A.
The next participant is the dative nominal, the participant to whom
the coconut is shown. Because the dative participant is first singular, a
person-number combination whose marking of participant relations fol­
lows a nominative-dative schema, it will be realized by the prefix va-,
the 0 form, or perhaps more precisely, the non-nominative form. Be­
cause the first person participant outranks the third person participant
by the first hierarchical principle, its prefix will occupy the ranking po­
sition closer to the verb stem. Finally, the remaining core participant,
urav 'coconut', a class VI singular noun, is realized on the verb by the
corresponding prefix of that class and number, k-. Because it is the low­
est ranking prefixed participant, its prefix will occur first. Now consider
( 5-30b). Again the verb is the ditransitive tkam 'show', and the first
of the three arguments is the third plural A marked by the prefix mpu3PL A. But in the example, the dative participant is third dual, and this
is a person/ number combination which follows an ergative-absolutive
schema. In these cases there is a distinct set of suffixes for dative partic­
ipants and the proper form here is -mpn 3DL D. Finally, the remaining
core participant urav 'coconut' is realized by its prefix k-, which as the
lower ranking of the two prefixes, occurs initially.
In these analyses, the underlying participant relations of (5-30a,b)
are identical. The differences in structure are accounted for by the same
general split in case marking schema that we saw with transitive verbs:
first and second person work accusatively (nominative-dative schema)
and third person works ergatively (ergative-absolutive-dative schema) .
The main point with ditransitive verbs is that the dative participants
marked with the prefixes identical in form to the 0 prefixes are not in an
0 relation; that is, the grammatical relationship between such a prefix
and its governing ditransitive verb differs from that of the same prefix
with a governing transitive verb. The notion of 0 is an applicable and
useful notion for transitive verbs, but is not extendable to ditransitive
verbs in Yimas. We may summarize the core arguments with the three
basic types of verbs in Yimas as follows,
intransitive verb:
transitive verb:
ditransitive verb:s
A
A0
TDwhere T refers to the theme core argument, that which is shown, given,
etc., i.e., whose location is at issue (Foley and Van Valid 1984). These
can only be third person in Yimas and must always be realized by theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE N OMINALS211first agreement prefix. A final point to be noted from these examples is
the form of the A prefix in (5-30a) . Compare this to the corresponding
transitive verb in (5-14b). In spite of its preceding the prefix va- 1SG
0, the A actually must appear in the A prefix form mpu- rather than
being optionally neutralized to the S/0 form pu-, as in (5-14b) . This is
because it does not occur initially in (5-30a) , but follows another prefix
k-. This is conclusive proof that the neutralization to the S/0 form
initially for third person prefixes (e.g. , (5-14b) ) is, as claimed, simply a
surface reflex of being in initial position, and nothing more. When not
in initial position, the true A form emerges.
Now we are ready to look in more detail at the morphology of di­
transitive verbs and the dative suffixes. The forms of the dative suffixes
for the three numbers in third person are as follows:
SG
- (n)aknDL
-mpnPL
-mpun(5-31) a. k-ka-tkam-r-akn
VI SG T-1SG A-show-PERF-3SG D
' I showed him (the coconut) . '
b. k-ka-tkam-tuk-nakn
VI SG T-1SG A-show-RM PAST-3SG D
'I showed him (the coconut) long ago.'
c. k-nan-tkam-r-mpun
VI SG T-2PL A-show-PERF-3PL D
'You all show them (the coconut).'
As (5-31a,b) demonstrate, there is some allomorphic variation for the
third singular dative suffix. - akn occurs following a [-peripheral] conso­
nant and - nakn occurs elsewhere.
A salient feature of all three dative suffixes is the final -n. This, of
course, bears a transparent relationship to the oblique suffix -n ,...., - nan.
The dative is in many ways a transitional relation between the true core
relations, represented by A, S, and 0, and the oblique, peripheral re­
lations of location and time (see Foley 1986, 96-8), and these Yimas
dative suffixes clearly seem to be formerly independent pronominal el­
Pments followed by the oblique suffix which have become bound to the
verb and reanalyzed as suffixes. These forms must always occur in ab­
Holute final position in the verb. If another suffix should follow them,
there are suppletive variants of these suffixes which must be used.
SG

b . ta-nan-tkam-r-mpan-JJ
NEG-2PL A-show-PERF-3PL D-VI SG T
'You all didn't show them (the coconut).'
These suppletive variants may represent the earlier basic forms of the D
suffixes, which were replaced in verb final position by the present day
verb final D suffixes when they became bound to the verb.
These D suffixes almost invariably reference human participants, but
one of the ditransitive verbs, pul- 'rub on', does allow inanimate nouns
to be marked by the dative suffixes. In these cases the noun class of the
inanimate D noun is never indicated, just its number.
(5-33) kacmpt
anti
canoe VIII PL ground VIII SG
i-kay-pul-e-mpun
VIII SG T-lPL A-rub-PERF-3PL D
'We rubbed ground on the canoes.'
kacmpt 'canoes' is a class VIII plural noun functioning as the D argument
of the ditransitive verb pul- 'rub on'. But because the D suffixes only
indicate number, it is impossible to mark its class, and so only its number
is indicated by the D suffix - mpun 3PL D.
Generally the conjugations of ditransitive verbs follow the rules given
earlier for transitive verbs-with the added complication, of course, of
another core argument. Ditransitive verbs associated only with third
person participants differ from the corresponding transitive verbs (5-19)
only in the presence of the D suffixes.

'They two showed it to him.'
wa-mpu-JJa-r-mpun
c. makaw
fish (sp) IX SG IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'They gave makau to them.'
The fourth inherently ditransitive verb, i- 'tell someone', is constrained
in that its theme argument must always be filled by the verbal prefix
pia-, referring to 'talk, language':THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS213(5-35) a. pia-mpu-i-c-akn
talk T-3PL A-tell-PERF-3SG D
'They told him.'
b. pia-n-i-c-mpun
talk T-3SG A-tell-PERF-3PL D
'He told them.'
Ditransitive verbs with a third person participant and a first or sec­
ond person participant are formed in two ways, depending on which is
A and which is D (we can ignore the theme argument here and in the
following because it is almost invariably inanimate or of relatively low
animacy status and never plays any role in determining the conjugation
of a ditransitive verb) . Because the first or second person participant is
higher ranking by hierarchical principle one, it will occupy the ranking
position of the pronominal prefix closest to the verb. If it functions as
A, it will appear in its proper A prefix form and the third person D will
appear as a D suffix.

'You two gave them both makau.'
c. pia-kay-i-c-akn
talk T-lPL A-tell-PERF-3 SG D
'We told him.'
If, on the other hand, the first or second person participant is the D
argument, it will be realized by the same prefix form as the 0 of a
transitive verb. It will still be the inner prefix because it is the highest
ranked, but the third person A will precede it in the A prefix form,
preceded in turn by the lowest ranking prefix, that for the T argument.

'They two gave you two makau.'
There is no example parallel to (5-37a,b) in which the A is third
singular. We have seen earlier with the transitive verbs that the third
singular form in Yimas is completely homophonous with second singular
and that is the case here. The rules which apply to second person A's214BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYfor ditransitive verbs apply to third singular as well. Ditransitive verbs
with first and second person participants differ in certain respects from
the corresponding transitive verbs. With the exception of verbs with a
first person A and a second singular D, it is not possible to mark both A
and D participants with pronominal prefixes. If the D argument is first
person and the A second person (or third singular), the D argument will
occur as the verb prefix for it is higher ranked. The A, if present at
all, must occur as an independent pronoun. This is in contrast to the
situation with transitive verbs, in which second person A's surface with
the S prefix forms (see (5-27)) .

d. pia-!Ja-i

'Youjhe told me.'
As can be gleaned from examples (5-38a,d) , verbs without associated
independent pronouns are ambiguous between a second or third person
singular A. These sentences can, of course, be disambiguated by adding
the independent pronoun mi 2SG for second singular or the near distal
deictic form m-n NR DIST-I/II SG 'he, she' for third singular.
Finally, for ditransitive verbs with a first person A and a second
person D, only the situation in which the D argument is second singular
allows marking of both participants on the verb. This is again done by
the suppletive form kampan- ""' mpan-. Number of the first person A
must be indicated by an independent pronoun; without such, singular is
assumed.

If the secopd person D argument is non-singular, then the suppletive
morpheme is not available. Only one of the two participants may be
realized by a verbal prefix, and parallel to the situation with transitive
verbs (5-29), this must be the second person D argument, rather than
the first person A. The A is then expressed through an independent
pronoun. Again, with no overt pronoun, a first person singular A is
assumed, unless context forces otherwise.

Tables 5-7 summarize the inflection with pronominal affixes of intran­

If one glances back to the array of pronouns presented in Section 3. 7, he
will note that Yimas actually distinguishes four numbers in its indepen­
dent pronouns: singular, dual, paucal, and plural. The paucal expresses
a set of a few; more than two and usually less than seven, but the ex­
act number varies quite widely according to context. Prototypically,
however, it refers to a class of three to five individuals, and is always
restricted to humans. So far in the exposition of the verbal pronominal
affixes, I have ignored the indication of paucal number. This is because
this number category works rather differently from the other three, and
it seemed simplest to postpone its introduction for ease of exposition. It
is now time to remedy this omission.
The expression of paucal number in a Yimas verb is, in fact, one
of the more complicated parts of the verbal morphology, although its
general pattern is like that outlined above for transitive and ditransi­
tive verbs. Again, there is the pervasive split in behavior between first
and second persons, on the one hand, and third person, on the other.
Basically, first and second person participants with paucal number do
not have distinctive person-number prefixes of their own. These use
the plural prefixes functioning in their normal three way role marking
contrast, in combination with the paucal suffix - vkt (realized as - vkut
by R spreading (rule (2-8)) following a tense suffix containing a fuf,
notably - ntuk RM PAST) . The third person paucal participants have
a distinct set of pronominal prefixes which follow the usual ergative­
absolutive schema for this person. Thus, consider the following paucal
forms for first person.
(5-42) a. pavkra-wa-t
1/2 PC S-go-PERF
'Wefyou few went. '
b . pu-kay-cay-c-vkt
3PL 0-1PL A-see-PERF-PC
'We few saw them.'
c. pu-kra-cay-c-vkt
3PL A-1SG 0-see-PERF-PC
'They saw us few.'
pavkra- is the bound S form for first and second person paucal and is
transparently related to the corresponding independent pronoun pavkt
1/2 PC. For the A and 0 forms there is no distinct paucal form. Rather
the plural prefixes, kay- 1PL A and kra- 1PL 0 are used, in combination
with the paucal suffix - vkt. This paucal suffix is in fact rather like the
third person D suffixes in that it must occur in absolute final positionTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS217TABLE 6Inflection with Pronominal Affixes of Transitive

'The women showed/taught the girls how to weave mats.'
Unlike the inherently directive and trivalent verb of saying i- 'tell', the
verb tmi- 'say' is non-directive and is bivalent. In (7-56a,b) the bivalent
verb root tmi- 'say' is derived into a trivalent verb theme by the valence
increasing prefixes tav- COM and tavkway- VIS. Although the verb
themes in (7-56a,b) are trivalent verbs of saying, they do not express
directive speech acts, so that the controller is the A participant. The
difference in semantics between these verbs and those in (7-54) explains
why these have A control, while those in (7-54) have D control.
The final example in (7-56) is especially interesting in that, in a
certain sense, there is some ambiguity as to the controller. If the sentence
simply denotes a situation in which women are weaving mats and girls
are watching in order to learn the skills, the controller is unquestionably
the A participant. If, however, the girls are actively weaving at the
same time as part of or as a result of the women's instruction, then
in a sense the girls must be regarded as co-agents of the complement.
In this situation, the D participant of the matrix verb is at least the
co-controller of the complement. But note that this latter scenario is
very close semantically to the directive speech act verbs. In (7-56c)
the A participants of the matrix verb (the women) perform an action
(showing, teaching) to get the D participants (the girls) to do the action
of the complement (weaving). This is semantically completely analogous
to directive speech acts, in which the speaker through the critical speech
act tries to get the addressee to perform the action of the complement.
To close out this section I wish to discuss in more detail the dif­
ferent semantic and morphological features of the four types of comple­
ments. Complements associated with the use of language, either external
(speech) or internal (thought) are invariably marked with - mpwi 'talk'.
This is linked to the pronominal prefix pia- (or its variants) on the ma­
trix verb. This may be the unmarked form for Yimas complements, for
occasionally a complement which is semantically one of the class of desire
complements will be realized morphologically as an - mpwi 'talk' com-400INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSplement. For example, both of the following are encountered, although
the former is much more common and accepted by native speakers as
'correct' Yimas:
am-tu-wampu!J
(7-57) a. yaki
na-na-ti-n
tobacco V PL eat-NFN-heart V SG 3SG S-DEF-feel-PRES
b. yaki
am-tu-mpwi na-na-ti-n
tobacco V PL eat-NFN-talk 3SG S-DEF-feel-PRES
'He wants to smoke.'
Both examples in (7-57) contain complements of desire, yet only the
( a) example is marked in the usual way, with - wampuv 'heart'. The ( b )
example uses - mpwi 'talk', but is in fact completely identical in meaning
to ( a) . Other examples of complements with - mpwi 'talk' can be found
in (7-52), (7-54) and (7-56) as well as earlier in this section.
The examples in (7-57) may suggest that complements of desire
marked by - wampuv 'heart' are losing ground to -mpwi 'talk' comple­
ments and may ultimately be replaced by the latter. Of the four types
of complements, those in - wampuv are undoubtedly the least common
in texts. Most examples I have are complements of a single verb of in­
ternal sensation, ti- 'feel' ( which does have meanings other than that
of internal sensation, like 'do' and 'become'), but other possible matrix
predicates are kacapal- 'forget' ( example (7-22)) or mama- 'bad'. The
complement marked by - wampuv 'heart' expresses an event that the A of
the matrix predicate or the speaker or addressee of the whole utterance
wishes to happen. It is, thus, a complement of desire, a desire of one of
the main participants of the speech act or of the A of the matrix verb.
Complements with - wampuv 'heart' do not normally co-occur with a
coreferential pronominal affix on the verb, but if there is any agreement,
it must be of the form for a class V singular noun, the morphological fea­
tures of the independent noun wampuv 'heart'. A couple of additional
examples of -wampuv 'heart' complements follow:

The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the contrast in syntactic
behavior between (4-60a) and (4-60b) is that (4-60a), without posses­
sive agreement, is a noun phrase, but (4-60b), with it, is not. The latter
construction is a scrambled paratactic construction, with the two nom­
inals in apposition to each other (as we will argue below). In addition
to these structural differences there is a semantic difference between
the (a) and (b) constructions, as demonstrated by the choice of nouns
in (4-60a) and (4-60b). The unaffixed (a) construction is largely re­
stricted to possessed kin terms. These are the only possessed nouns
for which it is commonly heard spontaneously and indeed is highly fa­
vored for them. The (a) construction with other types of nouns, while
grammatical, is only marginally so and is rarely encountered. The (b)
construction with the p�ssessive agreement suffix is much preferred with
non-kin nouns. It could be argued that this difference reflects a distinc­
tion between alienable and inalienable possession, but, since classically
inalienably possessed nouns such as body parts occur in the (b) con­
struction (as well as the possessor raising construction with verbs, see
Section 6.2.3.2), this claim does not seem entirely warranted. The (a)
construction seems reserved for kin terms only.
The (a) construction, i.e., the noun phrase structure, is restricted to
possessor-possessed phrases and true adjective plus noun constructions.
Phrases composed of kpa 'big', yua 'good', and ma 'other' have the same
restrictions as possessors lacking agreement.

Unlike possessive-possessed phrases, there is no semantic restriction for
true adjectives concerning the type of noun which can occur in either
the tightly knit noun phrase or the scrambled pattern. Common nouns
like patn 'betelnut' occur freely in both structures. Adjectival verbs
which require in all contexts the adjectival agreement suffixes are only
encountered in the scrambled pattern. The tightly knit noun phrase
structure is ungrammatical for them.

The two stems, mama 'bad' and waca 'small', which are simultaneously
members of the class of true adjectives and adjectival verbs, are espe­
('ially interesting. When they have the morphological properties of true
adjectives, they only occur in the tight noun phrase structure; with
t.he morphological properties of adjectival verbs, they are found in the
scrambled patterns.

As such, it can occur in any position and be freely separated from the
noun it modifies by other words.
We may summarize the behavior of these two constructions in the fol­
lowing table (where AGR indicates any adjectival/possessive agreement
suffix):

The constructions in the first column are clear examples of noun
phrases and should be generated explicitly by phrase structure rules.
An important generalization about noun phrases in Yimas is that they
may consist of only two constituents, a modifier and a head, in that
order. If more than two modifiers are present for a given noun, one
must take an agreement suffix and occur in the scrambled pattern.

What accounts for the difference between possessors and adjectives for

A noun phrase with a head noun composed of conjoined nouns, as in
( 4-75a), is ungrammatical. One uses either a conjoined construction of
two noun phrases, each consisting of an adjective plus a head noun, as
in ( 4-75b ), or a scrambled structure in which the adjective occurs with
an agreement suffix and has no restrictions as to its position, as in ( 475c,d). Note that the gender resolution in (4-75d,e) is to the masculine
dass I with the agreement suffix - mampan I DL. Using the corresponding
fmnale suffix - nput II DL, as in (4-75e) results in ungrammaticality. ThisNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES186illustrates the general gender/class resolution rule always neutralizes to
the unmarked class, class I for animates and class V for inanimates.
Clearly, the phrase structure rules needed to generate Yimas noun
phrases must produce structures of no more than two constituents, the
rightmost of which must be a noun, not another noun phrase, in order
to block structures like (4-75a). In other words, unlike English noun
phrases, those ofYimas are non-recursive, and the phrase structure rules
must reflect this. The following is suggested:
(4-76) NP
(M) + N
ADJ }
M
{ POSSR
N, of course, covers simple nouns like patn 'betelnut' as well as noun
compounds like numn karm 'native language'. ADJ covers all mem­
bers of the class of true adjectives, i.e., those which may occur without
agreement suffixes. POSSR consists of a noun or pronoun plus na POSS.
There is a selectional restriction concerning noun phrases with POSSR
to the effect that they are highly preferred when N is a noun, and disfa­
vored (but grammatical) elsewhere. The constituent preceding na POSS
in the POSSR slot is either a noun or a pronoun. As these are nominals,
it could be the case that a noun phrase precedes na and this would be
potential source for recursion. This possibility is more theoretical than
actual, however, for the language has general ways to avoid such possi­
bilities. For example, if we wanted to say 'my mother's brother's child'
with recursive in the POSSR constituent, one might expect the following:
(4-77) ?ama-na uayuk
na matn
na
lSG-POSS mother II SG POSS brother I SG POSS
kalakn
child I SG
'my mother's brother's child'
This is a possible structure but would, in fact, very rarely if ever be
uttered. There is a perfectly good kin term for 'mother's brother's child',
akay, just like 'cousin' in English, which would be used instead.
( 4-78) ama-na akay
lSG-POSS mother's brother's child
'my mother's brother's child'
Since the overwhelming use of possessives in noun phrases is with kin
terms, this effectively almost excludes recursion in the POSSR slot. But
even in cases with non-kin terms recursion may be avoided. Consider,
for example, the following phrase:
-->--tNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES187na kay
(4-79) ama-na matn
lSG-POSS brother-! SG POSS canoe VIII SG
'my brother's canoe'
This contains a recursive POSSR slot and is grammatical. But an al­
ternative, and preferred, way to express ( 4-79) is to treat the complex
POSSR constituent as a single noun phrase and attach the possessive
agreement suffix for kay 'canoe' to it, thus generating a scrambled struc­
ture overall.
( 4-80) kay
na-y
[ama-na matn]
canoe VIII SG lSG-POSS brother I SG POSS-VIII SG
'my brother's canoe'
It is important to note that noun phrases generated by the rules in
( 4-76) typically inflect as if they were single nouns. We have already
seen that noun class and number are obligatory inflections for nouns;
they cannot be carried solely by adjoining modifiers.
( 4-81) a. m-!Jkl
tuJJkUr!Jkl
NR DIST-VI DL eye VI DL
'those eyes'
b. m-!Jkl

NR DIST-VI DL eye
( 4-82) a. mu-m
payum
NR DIST-1 PL man I PL
'those men'
b. m-um
*panmal
NR DIST-1 PL man
The (b) examples are ungrammatical because the nouns appear in their
base forms (equivalent to the singular), but are modified by non-singular
pronouns. This is impossible. Nouns which are non-singular must be
inflected as such, e.g., in the (a) examples, number and noun class in­
flection may not be carried by adjoining modifiers. As the (a) examples
further demonstrate, the modifiers themselves must be inflected for the
same features of noun class and number.
But this is not the case with modifiers in noun phrases. In these
constructions, the adjective or possessor remains completely uninflected
for noun class and number (if they are so inflected the scrambled pattern
n�sults), and the head noun is the sole carrier of these features. In other
words, the noun phrase is assigned the features of noun class and number
a whole.

The claim that grammatical features are assigned to the noun phrase
as a whole is further borne out by the behavior of the oblique suffix. It
follows the head noun, but has scope over the whole noun phrase.
(4-84) a. [rna ka]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
b.*ma-nan ka-Jlan
other-OBL canoe VIII SG-OBL
(4-84b) shows that the modifier in a noun phrase cannot be affixed with
the oblique suffix even if its head noun already is indicating that the
domain of the oblique suffix is the whole noun phrase not just the head
noun.
The modifiers which freely form noun phrases are possessors and
true adjectives, but there are sporadic instances of other word types
occurring in noun phrases without their normal adjectival/possessive
agreement suffixes. An interesting example is the following:
(4-85) [[mpa ant]-Jlan
namat]
aypak
one ground VIII SG-OBL person I PL COP I PL
'We are one clan.' ('people of one ground')
The numeral mpa 'one' almost always takes adjectival agreement suf­
fixes, but here it occurs as modifier of a noun phrase which is the first
constituent of a compound. If mpa 'one' were to take an agreement suf­
fix in the above example, it would no longer form a noun phrase with
the following noun. Because nouns and noun phrases are the only pos­
sible first constituents in this compound it would then be ill formed.
Consequently, an agreement suffix for mpa is blocked in this case.
The scrambled structures have very different properties from the
tight noun phrases. They are not single noun phrases at all, but rather
two noun phrases in apposition, one consisting of a noun, the other a
modifier, nominalized by the agreement suffix. They are joined together
as a single semantic unit (but two syntactic units) by the agreement
suffix, for it is this marker on the modifier which links it to the noun
being qualified. In no sense, though, is this noun the head of the modi­
fier; they are only joined at the level of semantic interpretation to formNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES189a conceptual unit. Rather, there is evidence to suggest that the actual
head of the modifier is the agreement suffix itself.

The (a) examples are typical noun phrases, while (b) and (c) are
scrambled structures, with and without an overt deictic, respectively.
The (d) examples are the ones relevant here. They demonstrate that
a deictic cannot serve as the head of a noun phrase. Note the close
parallelism between the (b) and (d) examples. The agreement suffix in
(b) corresponds to the deictic in (d). This suggests that the agreement
suffix could be analyzed as the realization of the deictic, as follows:
( 4-88) [[yua]
m-ra]
good NR DIST-VII PL\ I[[yua] -ra]
In other words, modifiers affixed with the adjectival/possessive agree­
ment suffixes are noun phrases in miniature, with the agreement suffix
functioning as the head. A noun and a modifier affixed with an agree­
uwnt tmffix are simply noun phrases in apposition to each other. There190NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESis no strong syntactic relationship between them, merely a loose parat­
actic link, established by the coreference in noun class and number. This
accounts for the completely unconstrained permutations of word order
observed between a noun and a modifier with an agreement suffix. So
the structural relationships in a sentence like ( 4-86b) are as shown below:
[[yua-]ra]
[ya-n-ampa-wat]
(4-89) [imprampat]
basket VII PL good-VII PL VII PL 0-3SG A-weave-HAB
'She weaves good baskets.'
or more literally:
'She weaves baskets, good ones. '
There is no closer syntactic relationship in ( 4-89) between imprampat
'baskets' and yua-ra 'good' than there is between imprampat and the
verb. The linking between them is done at the semantic level; they
are interpreted as denoting the same real world objects because of the
coreference in the noun class and number specifications.
Further evidence that modifiers with agreement suffixes are noun
phrases in miniature is demonstrated by their behavior with the oblique
suffix, even when there is no overt noun in the clause.
( 4-90) [[[ma]-m]-un]
na-wapal
other-IV SG-OBL 3SG S-climb
'She climbed on another (sago palm) .'
The understood noun is tnum 'sago palm', indicated only by the class
IV singular adjectival suffix - (u)m. The claim is that the stem ma-m
other-IV SG is a noun phrase and, as expected, it may be affixed with
the oblique suffix.
A more interesting example is given below:
( 4-91) [anti]

ground VIII SG but
small-IRR-VIII SG-OBL
[kapa-taw-wat]]
lDL S-sit-HAB
'But we two live on a little land.'
As mentioned in Section 3.9, Yimas conjunctions like kanta 'but' have a
strong tendency to occur in the second position of the clause, as in this
example; but here it intervenes between a noun and an adjectival verb
modifier. The adjectival verb is nominalized and functions as a noun
phrase because of the suffix - i VIII SG (triggering the palatalization rule
(2-3) for the following /n/ ) . It is clear that it modifies anti 'ground'
because of their agreement in noun class and number features. The really
interesting detail is the position of the oblique suffix. While anti 'ground'
is obviously under the scope of the oblique suffix, it is only indirectlyNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES191linked to it, by having the same noun class and number specifications
as the noun phrase waca-k-i small-IRR-VIII SG, which is in turn affixed
by the oblique suffix. Note that the oblique suffix is here attached to
what would seem at first view to be a modifier rather than the head, but
given the claim that such modifiers are in fact noun phrases themselves,
the construction is quite straightforward.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"
