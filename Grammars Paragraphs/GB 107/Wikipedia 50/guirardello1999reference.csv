such alignment is observed in other parts of Trumai grammar as well; for example, when
the word order of a negative clause is “reversed” and the verb modified by the Negation
particle appears in first position, the configuration of the clause is nominal rather than
verbal: [V Neg ka_in Subj Cop]. The configuration of negative clauses is discussed'0 The consultants had difficulties in giving the negative version of example (91), i.e., ‘do not be a woman’.
The example they offered is the same as the negative version of (92):
(i)ditakwanachwoman Neg Imp
‘Do not marry.’ or ‘Do not be a woman (do not behave as a woman).’
We expected the nominal predicate to be negated by anuk, but the consultants insisted on the data above. It
might be that the use of di here is more adjective-like than noun-like, because negative Imperative
constructions with adjectives are also negated by tak:

RAQUEL GUIRARDELLO228CHAPTER 6
ModalityIn this chapter, issues related to modality will be presented. Some of the issues
treated here were already mentioned in previous chapters; for this reason, some points
will be treated briefly in this chapter, leaving more room for the issues that are new, such
as the alternative ways for expressing the negative modality in verbal and non-verbal
predicates.
First, there is a short section on declarative clauses; a general view of this kind ofclauses will allow us to see better the differences between them and the clauses in other
modalities. Next, we have sections on interrogative clauses (with polar and non-polar
questions), followed by a section on negative clauses, exploring negation in verbal and
non-verbal predicates. The negation of single elements, and negative words such as
‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, will also be addressed. Finally, we have a section on imperative
constructions in the affirmative and negative modalities.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"
"In the case of Transitive verbs, there is no parallel form to wanach (something like
wakich). The only difference between negative and affirmative Imperative for Transitive
verbs is that in the negative modality the particle waki follows the verb rather thanprecedes it:°
(89)mapatakwaki.break Neg Imp
‘Do not break it!’
(90)a.kititakwaki.give Neg Imp
‘Do not give (it).’
b. *kiti tak wakich.",[139]
"Cop‘I am not curved (I have never been curved).’6.3.5. Negation of single elements/specific pieces of informationSuppose that a person learns about a piece of information that s/he thinks is not
correct according to her/his knowledge. The person probably will try to negate this
specific piece of information, in order to present the correct one. For instance, somebody
is told: ‘I heard that your mother got seriously sick’, but the speaker is wrong about who
got sick.The interlocutor then may reply: ‘No, not my mother. It was my sister who got
sick.’ In the reply, a specific piece of information is being negated. How is this kind of
negation made in Trumai?
When the piece of information being negated involves a pronoun, numeral,
adjective, or quantifier, the negator used is anuk, which - as we have seen before - is the
Negation particle for nominal constituents. Looking at examples (66-70), we may think
that anuk is directly modifying the pronoun/numeral/adjective/quantifier. However, when
we look at example (65), we can see that what anuk is modifying is not really a noun, but
rather a NP, which is probably the non-verbal predicate of a subject that is assumed by
the context, but not formally present (i.e. (Who is coming) is not Kumaru ; cf. English
pleonastic ‘it’: It is not Kumaru). We believe that the same is happening in the other
examples, that is, what anuk is negating is the non-verbal predicates of the implicit245subject: (Who went to Pavuru) was not us; (The hammocks that I bought) were not two;
(The coffee that I made) is not much; (My sister) is not tall.e(65)Noun[Kumaru yi] anuk.

‘(It was) not much.’(I made coffee, but not much)e
(70)Adjective
atuk anuk.tallNeg‘(She’s) not tall.’ (my sister has many attributes, but she is not tall)Examples (68-69) above seems a little strange at first sight, because we would
expect the occurrence of [a’di tak] ‘a few (lit: not many)’ or [pix tak] ‘a little (lit: not
much)’, instead of Quantifier + anuk. A possible account for these examples would be to
say that [pix tak] and [a’di tak] are lexicalized as ‘a few’ and ‘a little’, respectively (a246point already mentioned in chapter 3, section 3.3.2). In this case, a separate negation
construction would be necessary for contrastive negation. If this hypothesis is accurate,
we would expect the combinations [a’di tak] anuk ‘it is nota few’ and [pix tak] anuk ‘itis not a little’ to be possible. If they are, then we indeed have a case of lexicalization.
This is a point to be checked in future field work.
Back to the negation of pieces of information, what about when the piece being
negated involves an adverb or a verb? In the case of an adverb, the negative word used ishahak, which means ‘no’ and which can be the answer to a yes/no question (example 71).
Hahak does not modify the adverb directly; the adverb is presented, followed by a pause,
and then hahak comes, negating apparently a presupposed question that includes the
adverb: [ (Am I going to sleep) here? No.]. In the case of a verb, we have the Negationparticle tak, modifying the verb (example 72). It is also possible to have the whole clause
repeated, but now in the negative modality (73).

dance Neg Foc/Tens 1 Cop
‘(No) I am not going to dance.’(I am going to sing, not dance.)2476.3.6. Other negative words (‘nobody’, ‘nothing’, ‘never’)As Givon (1984:323-328) points out, negative sentences normally are not used by
the speaker to convey new information about the verb or its arguments, but rather to deny
information that the speaker thinks the listener has in mind. Any negative act has a
presupposed (or backgrounded) portion and an asserted (or foregrounded) portion. The
background portion means that there is some shared knowledge between speaker and
listener, who have a kind of communication contract. The negation denies the asserted
portion of the corresponding affirmative sentence, but the presupposed portion is not
denied. So, when a speaker negates an event involving an entity, he may deny that the
event happened, or that the entity was involved in the event, but he does not deny the
existence of the entity, which is assumed by the speaker. As Givén says, the negation of
the referentiality of the entity is coded by other forms, such as the negative words nobody
and nothing.
In Trumai, there are no special words like English ‘nobody’ or ‘nothing’, but there
are ways of expressing the same idea. Let’s see how the negation of referentiality is
expressed in Trumai.enobody
The idea of ‘nobody’ is expressed through the negation of the verb plus the use ofthe noun yaw, which literally means ‘people’, but when in a negative clause, has the
opposite meaning: ‘no people’. For example:
(74)hu’tsa takchi_inhachisee
Neg Foc/Tens |
‘I did not see anybody.’yaw-as.","[272, 273, 274, 275]"
"The characteristics of the negative Imperative constructions in Trumai are
summarized below:
Verbal Predicate:
(Extended) Intransitive
(Extended) Transitive - animate O
(Extended)Transitive - inanimate OV Neg wanach
no data
V Neg wakiNominal Predicate:Pred Neg wanachAttributive Predicate:Pred Neg wanachAs we can see, Intransitive verbs - both simple Intransitive and Extended
Intransitive - present one kind of pattern, while Transitive verbs present another one.
When modified by the Negation particle tak, Intransitive verbs align with nominal
predicates (both use the particle wanach). On the other hand, nominal predicates align
with verbs when the Negation particle tak is employed in the negative Imperative252construction.’ Even the Transitive verbs show certain alignment with to nominal
predicates, if we take into account the fact that the Imperative particle follows the negated
Transitive verb, like it does with nominal predicates.
In the case of attributive predicates, the possibility of choosing a nominal or a
verbal Imperative particle, observed in the affirmative modality, is lost in the negative
construction, where only wanach - the same particle used for nominal predicates - is
observed. Therefore, the Imperative construction in the negative modality has an
asymmetrical system, with the boundaries between the different kinds of predicates
becoming a little fuzzier.
Finally, there is one alternative way for the expression of the negative Imperative
with verbs. Actually, this alternative way is not really an imperative construction, but
rather a simple clause, with the [Verb + Negator] in first position, followed by the adverb
nuk ‘then’.® This alternative way of expressing negative commands is possible both with
Intransitive and Transitive verbs. As example, we have:(86)ofa
tak nuk hi chi kasoro-s
hit/kill Neg then 2 Cop dog-Dat
“You do not beat the dogs!’(87)mapa tak nuk atlat chi.
break Neg then pan Cop
‘(You) do not break the pan.’7 However, as already mentioned in chapter 3, this point needs to be rechecked with other Trumai
consultants.
8 Despite the similarity in the phonological form, the adverb and the negator anuk are not the same
morpheme. Their syntactic behaviors are different.","[279, 280]"
"‘I do not want to cry.’Cop236(28)[kifi] tak hat’ke hai-tstahu yi.
give Neg in.future 1-Erg knife YI
‘J will not give the knife.’In relation to other possible ways of expressing negation of verbs (actually,
negation of roots that can be considered verbal), we have the use of the word t(a)ke‘Privative’. Actually, the clause is not really in the negative modality, since no negation
particle is employed, but there is a sense of negative condition due to the semantics of
t(a)ke. When contrasted with negative clauses that have tak, clauses with t(a)ke actually
present a semantic difference: the negative condition indicated by t(a)ke is permanent. For
example:
(29)amitakka_inchi-n.speak Neg Foc/Tens Cop-3Abs
‘He is not speaking (now, for some reason not specified here).’
(30)ami-tke
ke ka_in
chi-n.
speak-Priv KE Foc/Tens Cop-3Abs
‘He does not speak (he never speaks, he is mute).’
[ lit: He is deprived of speaking.]The use of the ‘Privative’ t(a)ke is the only alternative way of expressing negation
for verbal roots. The occurrence of the negator n(i)kik, whose use is observed in nominal
predicates (cf. section 6.3.2.1), is not possible with verbal roots:(31)a.sonetak ka_in
hachi.
drink Neg Foc/Tens1 Cop
‘I am not drinking.’
b. * sone-nkik ka_in ha chi.","[263, 264]"
"‘T am married.’
(lit: I have a woman)What about when the clause is a negative answer? Again, clauses with verbs show
the syntax of nominal predicates, but the Negation particle used is the one that typically
modifies verbs, tak. '9 For instance:
Negative answer to question - first person:V Neg

‘T am here.’[no Focus/Tense particle]When in the negative modality, locative predicates employ the Negation particle

YI Foc/Tens table-Loc Neg
‘The fish is not on the table.’Existential:
Existential predicates in Trumai are a little hard to characterize. They are betterdefined by their characteristics in the negative modality than in the affirmative one.
Existential predicates have word order Loc Subj (or Pred Subj), but no alternative
order is possible.* The Copula in general is not used, while the presence of the
Focus/Tense particle is highly frequent. As we can see, there are many overlaps between
the characteristics of existential predicates and the locative/nominal ones. Thus,
sometimes it is hard to tell if a clause in the affirmative modality is an existential or a
locative/nominal predicate. The existential reading is preferred depending on the
conversational context. For example:*4 This actually confirms a tendency already observed by Clark (1978): existential predicates tend to present
the order Loc Noun.","[234, 235]"
"Looking at the patterns presented above, we can see that there is only one way of
expressing permanent characteristics, but two ways of expressing temporary states.
Attributive predicates that indicate permanent characteristics are probably simple nominal
predicates, with the adjective nominalized by ke behaving in the same way as nouns. The205question is to understand the nature of the attributive predicates that indicate temporary
states. Let us first realign them strictly on the basis of word order:
affirmative:
negative:Adj
Subj (Cop)
Adj tak Subj (Cop)Subj Adj
Subj Adj anukLooking at the negative modality, we observe that when the order is nominal, the
negator is verbal, and conversely, when the order is verbal, the negator is nominal. In
other words, the negator has always opposite “polarity” in relation to the word order.
However, a problem remains: what are the semantic differences between the two
ways of expressing temporary states? So far, the only difference that could be detected
was due to pragmatic factors: the Subj Adj or Adj Subj (Cop) order is selected depending
on which information the speaker wants to highlight:
(83)kafe
coffeeyi
YIsupi.
bitter‘The coffee is bitter.” (comment)(84)supika_inkafeyi.bitter Foc/Tens coffee YI
‘The coffee is bitter (new info).’ (answer to the question: Is the coffee sweet?)In sum, it seems that the more adequate way of understanding attributive
predicates in Trumai is to take into account whether the attribute being expressed is
permanent or temporary. If permanent, we have a nominalized adjective in a nominal
predicate and no further complications. If temporary, we have a “hybrid” predicate, with
two possibilities: (i) nominal syntax but not-nominal nucleus (and consequently, notnominal Negation particle); (ii) verbal syntax but not-verbal nucleus and not-verbal206Negation particle. We could go deeper into this issue and explore the nature of adjectives
in general. As some scholars point out, adjectives refer to entities that are more timestable than verbs, but less than nouns (Givén 1984). This being so, it is not surprising that
in some languages adjectives shows properties of both nouns and verbs, since they
constitute an in-between category. Perhaps the temporal attributive predicates in Trumai
play along with this in-between nature, oscillating between nominal (permanent) or verbal
(temporary) characteristics. Could we say that an attributive temporal predicate with
nominal syntax indicates a slightly less temporary attribute than one with verbal syntax?
Or is the choice of a nominal or verbal syntax conditioned only by the same pragmatic
factors which condition order changes in verbal predicates? This remains a point for
further research.","[230, 231, 232]"
"IYI-3Abs‘It (something) is not water’{not existential meaning]6.3.3. Negation in possessive predicatesThe Negation particle tak is used for both inalienable and alienable possessive
predicates, negating the verb. In the case of alienable possession, the negator modifies
k’ad ‘to have’. In the case of inalienable possession, the negator tak modifies the
nominal root that indicates the possessed entity (and that behaves as the verb of the
clause; cf. section 5.2.6). For instance:(56)sapaun
soapka_in
k’ad
Foc/Tens havetak
Negke hachi.
KE | Cop‘I do not have soap.’(57)ato tak
arm Neg[alienable]ka_in
hachi.
Foc/Tens 1 Cop‘I do not have arms.’[inalienable]The alienable possessive predicate has an alternative way of expressing negative
sense, through the use of the postposition nik:
(58)yakir nik
ka_in = hachi.
salt without Foc/Tens 1 Cop
‘I do not have salt.’The inalienable possessive predicate also has an alternative way of expressing
negative sense, through the use of the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’. Although it is not clear as
yet, the use of t(a)ke here seems to imply that the subject has never possessed the object
in question. For instance, (60) probably means that the speaker has never had a sister, as243opposed to a person who does not have a sister because she died. We raise this hypothesis
on the basis of other occurrences of t(a)ke, where the sense of ‘never’ is evoked.
However, the semantics of example (60) need to be rechecked, in order to confirm ordisconfirm our hypothesis.
(59)ato-tkekeka_inha chi.arm- PrivKEFoc/Tens1Cop‘I do not have arms.’
(60)adifle-tkekeka_inha chi.sister-Priv KE Foc/Tens 1
‘I do not have a sister.’Cop6.3.4. Negation in attributive predicatesAs already mentioned in chapter 5, attributive predicates are very peculiar because
they can present both nominal and verbal-predicate word orders (i.e., Adj Subj(Cop)orSubj Adj), and also because when in the negative modality, they have the negator tak
occurring with the nominal order, while anuk occurs with the verbal one; in other words,
the opposite scenario observed in nominal and verbal predicates. For example:
(61)nachatakka_inha chi.curved Neg Foc/Tens 1 Cop
‘Iam not curved.’ (temporary)
(62)hanacha anuk.
1 curved Neg
‘Tam not curved.’ (temporary)Attributive predicates also have alternative ways for expressing a negative sense.
Like verbal predicates, they can use t(a)ke ‘Privative’, and like nominal predicates, they
can employ the morpheme n(i)kik:244(63)nacha-nkikka_inha chi.curvedFoc/Tens1Cop‘I am not curved.’
(64)nacha-tkekeka_incurved-Priv KE Foc/Tens 1hachi.","[270, 271, 272]"
"203If the clause has a verbal-predicate configuration, the predicate always indicates
temporary states, in both negative and affirmative modalities. However, in the negative
modality, the use of the verbal negator tak is allowed only with the word order [Adj tak
Subj Cop]. As already explained in the previous section, verbal predicates can also
present this word order when in the negative modality, but this construction is not the
typical one, since it is a “blend” of nominal and verbal predicates (it has the Copula and
nominal word order, but the verbal negator). However, that is the only order allowed with
attributive predicates if the negator is tak.
permanentNominal predicate-like:
Vebal predicate-like:Adj + ketemporarySubj (Cop)”Adj (+ke) anuk Subj (Cop)
4==wonAdj Subj (Cop)=Subj AdjAdj tak Subj(Cop)If the clause is negative and presents the same word order as prototypical verbal
predicates, the negator used is anuk, the same used for nouns. This is again a “blend” of
the characteristics of nominal and verbal predicates (now, we have verbal word order, butthe nominal negator): Subj Adj anuk.","[228, 229]"
"2336.3.1. Negation in verbal predicates6.3.1.1. Negating the verbAs already mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, to negate verbal predicates, the
Negation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such as
auxiliaries. Negative clauses can present different word orders, depending on whether the
clause is a simple statement or an answer to a question. When it is the second case (i.e.
answer), the clause has a nominal-predicate configuration (cf. chapter 5, section 5.2.3 on
this issue). For instance:A
(11)Vhai-tschi(_in)Negkuhmu tak.","[260, 261]"
"250For nominal predicates, the imperative construction uses the particle wanach,
which follows the predicate (cf 3.4.4). Attributive predicates can use both wana,
preceding the predicate, or wanach, following it (cf. 2.2.4).
The characteristics of the affirmative Imperative constructions in Trumai are
summarized below:
Verbal Predicate:
(Extended) Intransitive
(Extended) Transitive - animate O
(Extended)Transitive - inanimate Owana
wa
wakiNominal Predicate:Pred wanachAttributive Predicate:wana PredV
Vv
VPred wanachIn some examples we observe that a DAT argument can be included in the
imperative construction, coming before the Imperative particle or after the verb. O can
also be included, but notice that this occurs more often with body part terms; we believe
that the body part term occurs in the imperative construction because it is actually
incorporated into the verb (cf. chapter 9, section 9.1.2.2). The S and A arguments are
never attested in the imperative construction. Examples:
(83)(84)(85)ine-tl waki kiti
3-Dat Imp give
wanawaimi hai-tlImptellwakudImp up.hair1-Dat‘Give (it) to him.’‘Tell me.’tete.make.beautiful“Comb his hair.’251The imperative constructions in the negative modality present a more complex
scenario. The construction with Intransitive verbs involves the use of the Negation
particle tak modifying the verb, followed by the Imperative particle wanach. The
construction with Transitive verbs employs the same particle used in the affirmative
modality, waki, with the difference that now the particle follows the verb modified by the
Negation particle tak.
Nominal and attributive predicates also employ the Imperative particle wanach,
which follows the negated predicate. The predicate is modified by the Negation particle
tak, not anuk, as we would expect for nominal predicates.","[277, 278, 279]"

(e.g. I do not work), the morpheme t(a)ke ‘Privative’ is used (cf. chapter 4, section 4.3).",[224]
"6.2.2. Information QuestionsThis kind of question involves the use of one of the interrogative words
(cf. chapter 2, section 2.2.3): te ‘who’; hele ‘how’; hamuna ‘where’, etc. The NP with the
interrogative word comes in first position, receiving the necessary case marking, and
usually is followed by the morpheme in, a mark of focus (cf. chapter 5, section 5.1.1).

will be presented briefly, as they were already described in previous chapters. As we will
see, in Trumai there are two main negators, the Negation particles tak and anuk. in
addition, there are other words which can also be used to express the idea of negation.
These words are the postposition nik ‘without’, the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’, and themorpheme n(i)kik.
We also have in this section a discussion with regard to scope, based on the ideas
of Givon (1984). As he explains, sometimes the scope of negation can be narrowed down,
with only one constituent being negated (the verb, a NP, etc.). By narrowing the scope, a
speaker can make the grounds of denial more precise. When scope is not narrowed, we
have a neutral negation, that is, the event as a whole is denied. According to Givon,
different strategies can be used for the negation of a single constituent. Some languages
front the constituent to be negated; other languages move the constituent to the clause
final position. Trumai has both strategies, but fronting is more common.","[259, 260]"
"There is one extra problem that needs to be discussed: the behavior of ke in
negative answers with a verb in first position (such as in example 74) is not exactly the
same as the ke that occurs when the Absolutive NP is non-adjacent to verb, because the202latter is obligatory. Thus, we would have to say that we have a fourth kind of ke in
negative answers, and that this ke is perhaps another derivation from the Relativizer ke.
It is not clear if this analysis is desirable; that is, if it is really necessary to
distinguish every single instance of ke as being a different case, or if it would not be
better to unify them. It is hard to make a decision. An additional fact that deserves
attention is that a verb negated by tak patterns together with nominal elements in other
contexts, for example, in imperative constructions (cf. chapter 3, section 3.3.4, and
chapter 6, section 6.4). Thus, perhaps the presence of morpheme ke in negative answers
has to do with the negative modality itself rather than to the “answering question”
construction. In the moment, what it is visible is that ke here interacts with both focus and
negation.","[227, 228]"

hai-ts anukhi adifle midoxos.l-Erg Neg2sister call‘(It was) not me (who) called you sister.’The negation of the DAT argument and other kinds of NPs usually employs the
negator tak. The constituent being negated comes at the end of the clause; additionally,
there is a pause between the end of the clause and the negated element:3 The construction in example (32) is a cleft. Observe the occurrence of the Relativizer ke and the presence
of two morphemes chiin the construction: one is the Copula, negated by anuk; the other one is the
Focus/Tense particle. The negator anuk is never observed modifying the Focus/Tense particles (in simple
clauses, anuk and the Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur; cf. section 6.3.2.1).
*As mentioned, the negator anuk and the Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur in the same clause. The
exception is negative clefts, like the example above, where anuk and the particle co-occur. However, notice
that here the Focus/Tense particle is in its reduced form (i.e. chi). The occurrence of the full form (i.e.chi_in) is not accepted by the Trumai consultants:
(i)* ha chi anuk chi_in katnon ke.
(It was not me whe worked.)The construction above needs further investigation, in order to be better understood.","[264, 265]"
"253It is interesting to observe that the Imperative constructions with verbs can also
employ the adverb nuk, as well as the adverb hen, translated as ‘then’ too (the semantic
differences between hen and nuk are explained in chapter 3, footnote 12). The adverb hen
is usually used in the affirmative modality (88-89), while nuk is more often used in thenegative (examples (90-91). However, this is just a tendency, not a rule, since nuk can
also be found in affirmative imperative constructions (92).

the locative, plus the use of the word tsifan, which usually means ‘thing’, but when in a
negative clause, has rather the meaning of ‘nothing’:
(80)mesayi-ntakka_intsifanyi.table yiI-Loc Neg Foc/Tens thing YI
‘There is nothing on the table.’ (lit: There is not a thing on the table.)enever
The use of the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’ implies the sense of ‘never’. Apparently,the idea is that the subject is deprived of something not temporarily, but actually because
s/he never has had it. For instance:
(81)watkantakekeka_inha chi.cry

"6.1. Review of declarative clausesIn this section, the issue of word order will be addressed, in order to give us a
better idea of the differences and similarities between declarative and negative clauses (as
we will see, negative clauses can present variations in word order for the purpose of
narrowing the scope of negation).
As mentioned in chapter 5, simple declarative clauses can have verbal or nonverbal predicates. For clauses with verbal predicates, the basic or unmarked word orders229are [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. Variations in the order are possible when a specificpiece of information needs to be highlighted. The piece of information — which is a
constituent - comes in the first position of the clause, and can be followed by the
Focus/Tense particle ka_in or chi_in (actually, the fronting of the constituent seems to bethe important step for the highlighting). If the constituent being highlighted is a NP, extra
verbal morphology may be necessary, depending on its grammatical role (i.e. if it is an
Absolutive NP).
For clauses with non-verbal predicates (i.e. nominal, equative, locative,
existential), there are two possible word orders, [Pred Subj (Cop)] and [Subj (Cop) Pred],depending on pragmatic factors, that is, which piece of information needs to be
highlighted. A Focus/Tense particle in general is used after the element under focus,
although it is not always employed (again, the fronting of the information seems to be the
important factor). The presence of the Copula chi‘ is often attested for nominal and
equative predicates, but is not always required, especially with 3rd. person subjects (for
nominal predicates, when the order is Subj Pred, the copula is present). Locative and
Existential predicates almost do not employ the Copula chi. Only the order [Pred Subj] is
possible for existential predicates.
Attributive predicates can present two orders, one nominal (Pred Subj Cop),
another verbal(Subj Pred), and so far there is no reason to consider one more basic thanthe other. Their use probably indicates different nuances in the semantics of the clause.
This is the overall scenario with regard to simple declarative clauses. Now, let us
see how clauses are configured in other kinds of modalities.","[256, 257]"
"211In the case of the existential predicate, the subject position presents no lexical
item (___ is without water) and most important, the 3Abs enclitic does not occur. In
example (104) the lexical zero is due to discursive reasons, but the enclitic codifies the3rd person subject. As we will see in chapter 9, in several cases the absence of the enclitic
can give to the clause a generic or existential sense (cf. section 9.1.1).
What about the use of the negator tak? We presented to our consultant data where
tak was used instead of nik:
(105)misu takka_iniyi.water NegFoc/TensIYI‘There is no water’The consultant accepted this kind of data. However, she has never offered it
spontaneously, and we have never observed such example in texts or in naturalconversation, so we wonder if this use is indeed possible. If so, how can we analyze it?
We observe that the example (105) is similar in structure to one of the possible negative
possessive predicates, which is exemplified below:
(106)(107)kuchtakka_inhachi.hair Neg Foc/Tens
‘T do not have hair.’|kuchiyi-n.takka_inCophair Neg Foc/Tens IyI-Abs
‘He does not have hair.’The difference between (105) and (106-107) is that in (105) the subject has a lexical zero
( __ does not have water) and no 3Abs enclitic. So, again it seems that the constructionused to express possession can be used to express existence too. The problem of example212(105) is that tak is being used to negate misu ‘water’, which is not an inalienably
possessed noun. The possessive construction with tak is observed with body part and
kinship terms (cf. section 5.2.6). Therefore, example (105) is very atypical and needs to
be rechecked before we can draw further conclusions.
There are some examples with nik in which the entity whose existence is reported
appears twice in the clause: in the subject and in the predicate position; these examples
were offered spontaneously by the consultant:
* affirmative

human.being without human.being Cop house-Loc
‘There are no people in the house.’(lit: People are without people in the house.)Observe that in (109) the order of the physical location piken ‘in the house’
changes, but the structure of the rest of the clause is the same: Pred Subj. Example (109)
is typologically uncommon, since existential constructions in most languages do not have
the entity expressed twice in the clause. Perhaps (109) could be better understood if we
consider the relationship between locative and possessive or existential predicates. Clark
(1978) points out that there is a locative basis for both existential and locative213constructions, and that the possessive construction could be analyzed as a more abstract
kind of location. So, when we say The book is Mary’s, we could say that the book can be
localized in relation to Mary, in the same way that the book can be localized in relation to
the box if we say The book is in the box. The same would be true for a clause such as The
book is with Mary.","[236, 237, 238, 239]"
"Foc/Tens IYI‘There is no water.’
[if the clause had the Abs enclitic, its semantics would be different: “He does not
have water.’]So, in some sense, examples (05-07) above are similar to negative existentialclauses or natural phenomena clauses in that neither has S morphology. However, they
are not the same; examples (05-07) cannot present the same word order as negative
existential clauses (i.e. Pred Foc/Tens iyi):
(10)*ami ka_in iyi.",[367]
1haveand the negative version of this clause will have the verb k’ad ‘have’ negated by tak (cf. section 6.3.2.4).,[268]
"5.2.4. Attributive predicatesAttributive predicates involve the use of adjectives as the nucleus of the predicate.
They share characteristics of both verbal and nominal predicates, and there are indications
of temporary versus permanent states.
If the clause has nominal-predicate configuration, and the clause is not in the
negative modality, the predicate can indicate a temporary state if the predicate contains
only an adjective, or a permanent attribute if the adjective is modified by ke, probably the
relativizer morpheme. If the clause is in the negative modality, it indicates permanent
attributes (ke can also appear, but its use is optional in this case).",[228]
"Trumai has rich syntax, although word order can change because of pragmatic
factors. The case-system shows an Ergative-Absolutive alignment. With regard to
grammatical relations, the traditional relations of ‘Subject’, ‘Object’, and ‘Indirect
Object’ do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. The case-marking system and the
syntax of the language consistently identify three argument types: Absolutive, Ergative,
and Dative; each type contains a subset of the traditional relations.
Other interesting facts observed in Trumai: (i) when a Transitive verb iscausativized, both the causer and the causee are marked as Ergative; (11) the main strategy
for voice manipulation is argument suppression; (iii) there is a construction that could be
classified as an instance of “possessor ascension”; (iv) the verb of a complement clause
behaves as an inalienably possessed noun (more specifically, as a body part term); (v)
there are multiple types of negative clauses in Trumai.","[5, 6]"

‘Where do you (PL) want to play?’(12)hele in

how Focus 2 work YI
‘How is your work?’(13)hanyi in?what YI Focus‘What is this?’The morpheme in can be classified as a mark of ‘Focus’, because it signals whichpiece of information is requested by the speaker, who has a gap in his/her knowledge with172regard to it; in other words, in refers to the piece of information that is new and crucial to
the person who asks the question. The term ‘focus’ is used in the linguistic literature to
refer to new information.
As showed in chapter 2 (section 2.2.3), not all WH-questions have the morpheme
in, because the use of the WH-word itself is enough to indicate that information is being
requested. The use of in just makes more explicit which piece of information is missing
in the knowledge of the person who makes the question.
The morpheme in sometimes can be found in affirmative clauses, such as in
examples (14-16) below. However, the occurrence of in in non-interrogative clauses is
rare. We hardly find examples like the ones above, while the number of affirmative
clause with ka_in and chi_in in is high.

postposition nik ‘without’, which modifies the noun yaw:

The idea of ‘nothing’ is implied by the negative modality of the clause, plus thefact that there is no “patient” mark in the clause: in the case of an Extended Intransitive

passivization that demotes Intransitive subjects, observed in some languages of the world339(such as Sanskrit or Dutch, which allow passivization of Intransitive verbs); that is,
instead of describing that an entity is performing an event (‘something is speaking’), the
clause would rather be a statement that an event exists: ‘there is speaking (by some
indefinite entity)’. Notice that clauses that express natural phenomena or negative
existential clauses also do not present a lexical subject nor the 3Abs enclitic:

"201If ke here is a Relativizer, then [disi ke] means ‘one who kills’ and it is a nominalpredicate (the Copula is not presented here, but as mentioned in chapter 3 (section 3.5)
the Copula does not always occur in a nominal predicate). In this case, shouldn’t the
“subject” [kiki wan] ‘men’ be in the Absolutive? Instead, it is [pelasawak] ‘tapir’ that is
in the Absolutive, but tapirs are not the killers here, they are rather the killed ones. The
nominalizer for ‘patient’ is -t’(a), not -k(e) (cf. chapter 3, section 3.2). Therefore, it doesnot seem adequate to say that ke in (76) is a Relativizer, and that this example is an
instance of a cleft construction.
An alternative analysis would explain the morphosyntax of a cleft as indicating
the historical source of the modern construction, but would argue that, as in the case ofthe clefts for old obliques/NP Possessors that became main clauses (as argued in section
5.1.3), the construction has been reanalyzed into a standard clause type. Thus, thepresence of the Copula, the morpheme ke relativizing the verb, and the Negation particle
anuk would be explained. However, both the construction and the morpheme ke would
have changed their status as the construction was used more and more. Finally, it would
have been reanalyzed as a regular clause, with the difference that the verb comes in first
position. The morpheme ke does not indicate relativization anymore; the fact that ke is
optional in the negative clauses would be evidence for reanalysis. The question is to
identify the function of ke in the examples (68-69b), (74), and (75) above.","[226, 227]"

central area of Brazil, in the Xingu Reserve (see map, appendix 2). The current work is
the first attempt at organizing a reference grammar of this language, providing a general
description of how the system of Trumai is organized .
As the reader will notice, this study is not complete. Several points are only
partially explored due to lack of sufficient data. I apologize for this fact, but unfortunately
the work of description and analysis of an unknown language is susceptible to this kind of
problem when the access to the consultants is not so easy. On the other hand, there are somany different aspects to be explored in a language that is almost impossible to study it in
a very comprehensive way in only a few years. Thus, the current study has the limitations
of being just a Ph.D. dissertation, and not the “most definitive” work on the Trumai
language. In the future, I intend to fill gaps found in this work and refine the points that
need more analysis. I also intend to analyze certain aspects of the language in separate
studies, investigating these specific aspects in a deeper way.
Next, we have information about the Trumai people, their language, and about my
research work with them.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"
"3Poss-husband-Neg Foc/Tens
‘I am not her husband.’1Cop6.3.2.2. Negation in locative predicatesAs already mentioned in chapter 5, locative predicates are negated with the verbal
negation particle tak. Apparently, there is no alternative way to negate locatives. As
examples, we have:

‘I am not in the house.’Cop(52)pike-n tak

‘without’. This construction is also observed with alienable possession predicates (cf.
section 6.3.3). The use of the negation particle anuk is not possible for existential clauses
(if anuk is used in the same context, it changes the semantics of the clause). Examples:
(54)= misu_ nik
ka_in
iyi.

YI[this clause could also be interpreted as: The fish are many. Speakers use this

"Cop snake-Erg‘I have never been bitten by a snake.’ (lit: Snakes have never bitten me.)6.4. Imperative constructionIn this section, we will re-elaborate some points already mentioned in chapter 3,
with respect to the Imperative construction in Trumai.
In the affirmative modality, the imperative construction requires the use of the
particles wana, wa or waki, which precede the verb. The particles are selected depending
on the kind of verb being modified - Transitive (wa, waki) or Intransitive (wa) - and forTransitive verbs, depending on the semantic characteristics of the patient: animate (wa) or
inanimate (waki); cf 3.4.4 for examples.",[277]

‘I do not have teeth.’
(127)takkehachi.knife Foc/Tens have Neg
‘I do not have a knife.’tahuka_ink’adKE1CopThe same is observed with regard to the expression of the desiderative mood: the
auxiliary t(a)ke modifies the word k’ad in the case of alienable possession, and thenominal root that behaves as the verb in the case of inalienable possession:
(128)ha icha-tke.
1 tooth-Des‘I want to have teeth.’
(129)tahuka_inha k’ad take.knifeTens/Foc1have Des‘I want a knife.’Finally, as mentioned in section 5.2.1., besides the construction above, predicativealienable possession can present an alternative way of expressing negation, through the
use of the postposition mik:
(130)asukanikka_inha chi.sugarwithout Foc/Tens 1Cop‘I do not have sugar.’ (lit: ‘I am without sugar.’)5.3. Expression of tense and aspect/modality in non-verbal predicatesAs said before, in verbal predicates tense or aspect/modality differences can be
expressed via the use of adverbs, the Focus/Tense particles ka_in and chi_in, and
auxiliaries. Aspect differences are expressed by the use of auxiliaries, as shown in chapter
3. Tense differences can be expressed in the following ways:220Present:use of the Focus/Tense particle ka_inPast:use of the Focus/Tense particle
use of the Focus/Tense particle
use of the adverbFuture:use of the adverb
use of the adverbka_in
chi_in
kaksuhat’ke
ifkefor recent past
for more distant past
‘in.past’
‘in.future
‘in.future(for sure)’
(not sure)’The question is how time and aspect/modality differences are expressed in nonverbal predicates, given that they do not have a verb to be modified by an auxiliary. As
we will see in the next subsections, the Trumai speakers have strategies for expressing the
variations in tense and aspect. We will start with the more simple cases (Existential
predicates), moving later to the more complex ones (nominal predicates).","[244, 245, 246]"
"Cop-3AbsThen a question arises: can the order between ke and tak be reversed, in order to
negate not only the verb, but the whole predicate? The answer is no. The negator tak is
used if we negate the verb itself, that is, if we want to negate the nucleus of the predicate.
If we want to negate the predicate as a whole, then the Negation particle used is anuk,
which typically negates nominal predicates, as illustrated above:(75)Vv
Neg S
Cop
DAT
ofa ke anuk ha
chi
fe’de-s.
kill
Neg 1
Cop jaguar-Dat
‘I do not kill jaguars (habitually).’200In all of the examples given above, the clauses have the structure of a cleft
construction: the verb is isolated in first position in order to be highlighted, it undergoes
relativization, and the Copula is present.”! So, example (68a), which is an answer to the
question ‘Do you work?’, could be interpreted as: ‘Yes, I am one who works’. The use of
the negator anuk in example (75) suggests that the verb is relativized. Therefore, one
possible analysis would be to say that all the examples above are instances of cleft
constructions with focus on the verb/predicate.
However, this analysis cannot explain one syntactic property of these
constructions: when the negator tak directly modifies the verb (example (74)), kebecomes optional. It would be strange for a cleft construction to optionally relativize the
verb. Another problem with analyzing all of (68-69b), (74), and (75) as instances of cleftsis that this construction occurs more frequently than we would expect for a cleft.
Basically, these clauses are the usual way of answering a yes/no question about a habitual
event.
There is one more problematic point in saying that these examples are instances of
cleft: how can we account for a clause with a Transitive verb - such as the example below
- where the “subject” of the “nominal predicate” (i.e. the relativized verb) is marked as
Ergative?
(76)[ni’de pak]-ki_—disikethis month-Dat kil/hit KE

‘I always/habitually scarify the woman (example (27) recalled)YI].","[225, 226]"
"1-Erg Foc/Tens Yaka dance Caus Intens
‘{ made Yaka dance very much.’Even though we do not have data for the combinations [V Aux (Caus) Intens], [V
Aux (Intens) Caus], and [V Caus (Aux) Intens], we could expect these orders to bepossible, due to the logical combinations of the auxiliaries and the particles. However,
these orders still need to be checked before we can draw firm conclusions. So far, we can
say that the relationship between auxiliaries and the Intensity particle is rigid (only the
Aux-Intens combination is allowed), while the relationships involving the Causative
particle (i.e., Causative particle and auxiliaries, or Causative particle and Intensity
particle) present more flexibility in combination (cf. section 3.3.3. for discussion on this
point).
The Imperative particles wa, wana, and waki are another kind of verbal particle.
Unlike the Causative, Intensity and Negative particles, the Imperative particles precede
the verb:
(26)a. wana sone‘Drink!’b. waki husa
c. wa husa‘Tie it (thing)!
‘Tie him (animal, people)!’There is one more Imperative particle, wanach, which follows the verb. However,
it only occurs with a verb already modified by the Negation particle tak:95(27)sone tak wanach‘Do not drink!”drink Neg Imp3.1.3. The 3Absolutive enclitic -n/-eThe enclitic -n/-e occurs on the last element of the VP, usually the verb. If the
verb is modified by an auxiliary, the Causative or Intensity particle, or an adverb, the
enclitic attaches to the verb modifier (cf. chapter 4; cf. sections 3.3 and 3.4).
As already seen in examples (1-2), this enclitic is in complementary distribution
with the head noun of the NP that is S or O. More examples:
(28)a.axosyiwatkan.child YI
cry
‘The child cried.’
b. iyi. watkan-e.

“S/he cried.’
(29)a. hai-ts ka_inkikiyi1-Erg Foc/Tens man YI
‘I called the man.’
b. hai-ts ka_inmidoxos.calliyi. midoxos-e.","[120, 121]"
"""” Besides the use of anuk, which is more usual, there is an alternative way of expressing negation in
nominal predicates: the use of n(i)kik. See chapter 6, section 6.3.2.1.",[220]
"2396.3.2.1. Negation in nominal and equative predicatesNominal predicates are negated via the Negation particle anuk. Since one of the
possible orders for nominal predicates is [Pred Subj (Cop)], no special strategies are
necessary to narrow the scope of anuk. The Focus/Tense particles cannot co-occur with
anuk. Examples:
(39)axosanukha chi.child Neg
1 Cop
‘Tam not a child.’
(40)payeanukhi chi.shamam Neg 2 Cop
“You are not a shaman.’
(41)a.t-echeanuk3Poss-husband Negha chi.","[266, 267]"
"215What makes example (109) uncommon is the fact that the localizer - the entity
itself - is being expressed, a fact that we would not expect, for the reason explained
above:
(113)pike-nka_inyaw _nikhouse-Dat Foc/Tens people without
‘There are no people in the house.’yawchi.peopleCopIn the house, people = {the “spot” that has people} is without people.’This is just a first approach to the problem of existential clauses in Trumai. This
point deserves extended discussion, but must be reserved for future studies.
As a final remark, we would like to point out that the construction observed in
examples (100-101) - that is, lexical zero in the subject position and no presence of 3Abs
enclitic - can be found in the affirmative modality for the expression of natural
phenomena:

1 run‘Tran little.’ (lit: I ran not a Jot.)Another way of expressing intensity is via reduplication. Actually, reduplication
in Trumai can be used to express several things: actions performed with intensity, with
extra energy or extra speed, and actions performed several times. It also can be used for
emphatic speech. The Trumai reduplication confirms a tendency already observed in105other languages, in which reduplication is used for similar reasons (Kemmer 1993describes some of the functions of reduplication observed in languages of the world).
Below, we have some Trumai data where the idea of intensity or repeated action is
involved:a. intensity:
(60)
a. faxa
b. faxataxa‘hard’
‘very hard’b. extra speed:
(61)
a.amech
b. ameamech‘lightning’
‘fast lightning’c. action performed several times:(62)a.pen

‘to vomit several times’(63)a.make‘to bite’b. makemake‘to chew’d. emphatic:

a. huk’an
b. huk’an huk’an‘still’
‘still - emphatic speech’3.3.2. Negation ParticleLike the Intensity particle , the negator tak can be considered a particle because itsposition of occurrence is restricted (therefore, it is not an adverb) and it can modifyseveral kinds of elements: verbs (plus auxiliary or intensity/causative particle), adjectival
predicates, adverbs and quantifiers. Unlike auxiliaries, the Negation particle does not
receive the 3Abs enclitic, as already pointed in the section on this enclitic. Its counterpart
for nominal predicates is anuk, already presented in chapter 2.

the Intensity particle modifying the quantifier in first position, the Intensity particle comes
after [quantifier + tak], while with verbs the order is V + Intens + Neg. For example:
(71)a.mayumane takka_ineat Intens Neg Foc/Tens

"Before analyzing the structure of simple clauses, we have to take a look at some
facts observed in Trumai that are relevant to understanding the configuration of simple
clauses. As already seen in previous chapters, Trumai is an almost completely isolating
language. There is little nominal and verbal morphology, and no tense or aspectual marks168in the verb. Aspectual differences are not expressed by verbal morphology, but rather by
the use of auxiliaries. Tense is expressed via the use of adverbs, especially kaksu
‘in.past’, hat’ke ‘in.future (certain)’, ifke ‘in.future (uncertain)’, or via the occurrence ofthe Focus/Tense particles ka_in and chi_in, which can indicate present/recent past events
or more distant past ones (the particles will be better described in the next section).
However, not all clauses contain adverbs or Focus/Tense particles. In a text, we observe
that in general the first clause presents the Focus/Tense particle or an adverb. The
following clauses occur without any tense indicator, but by the discursive context and by
the indicators in the first clause, we can identify if the event described in each sentence is
occurring in the present, past or future. This means that a clause in isolation - that is, out
of context - can be ambiguous in relation to tense, but in context there is no such
problem. The examples below illustrate what was said here:

"129For Heine, the use of the term ‘auxiliary’ is “...primarily associated with a limited
range of notional domains, most of all with the domain of tense, aspect, and modality”,
although he says that auxiliaries are not restricted only to these domains. Heine analyzes
auxiliaries using a diachronic/grammaticalization perspective, and he describes the
schematic concepts employed in the evolution of auxiliaries from verbs (the form in
evolution from one kind of meaning, more concrete, to another one, more abstract). With
this approach, the behaviors exhibited by auxiliaries and their relationship with verbs
become more clear. The basic idea is that “..an auxiliary is no longer a full verb but not
yet a grammatical inflection either...” (Heine: 86). That is, auxiliaries are a kind of
intermediate form, which gives account in some degree for their behaviors.
Given the lack of historical information about Trumai and the impossibility of
doing internal reconstruction for this description, we are not going to use a diachronic
approach. However, we will take into consideration some of the ideas presented by Heine.
So, the forms that we calling auxiliaries in Trumai are verbal modifiers associated
with the domain of aspect, mood, and spatial orientation (this last domain is subdivided
into body posture of the entity performing the event and directionality of the event being
performed). These forms present what Heine calls the “amphibian nature” of auxiliaries:
they are neither clearly lexical nor clearly grammatical units. They are different from
main verbs, from adverbs, and they cannot be treated together with verbal particles.
To distinguish them from verbs, the forms classified as auxiliaries in Trumai show
several differences:130(i) they do not have independent argument structure (cf. section 4.2.1.1);(ii) they lack lexical content: aspect/mood auxiliaries have very abstract meaning; body
posture and directional auxiliaries have a semantic content that is also relatively abstract
(cf. section 4.2.2.3);
(iii) many of the forms exhibit phonological reduction (cf. section 4.2.2.1). Heineobserves that forms that undergo grammaticalization lose formal characteristics of the full
categories, and later they even undergo changes in phonological form;
(iv) they form a closed class, i.e. only members of the auxiliary class are allowed to
behave as one of them. Full verbs cannot behave like them;To distinguish them from adverbs, the difference is that auxiliaries do not exhibit
flexibility of position like adverbs do. The forms classified as auxiliaries can occur only
inside the VP, following the verb (cf. section 4.2.1.2).
The distinction between the auxiliaries and the verbal particles (i.e. Imperative,Negation, Intensity, and Causation particles) is somewhat more complicated because they
are very Similar: both auxiliaries and the particles are postverbal, internal to the VP, and
they have abstract content. Thus, we considered the possibility of eliminating the category
of auxiliaries and treating them as being verbal particles too. We also considered the
possibility of doing the reverse, that is, including the particles into the auxiliary category.
It seemed to us finally that it was more adequate to keep the two categories apart,
because of certain facts: first, no particle exhibits phonological reduction, while some
auxiliaries do. Each verbal particle exhibits particular behaviors that are not shared by the131forms classified as auxiliaries:
ethe Imperative particles are preverbal, so they are clearly different. Only the particle
wanach is postverbal, but it does not make sense to treat wanach differently from the
other Imperative particles;ethe Negation particle tak does not receive the 3Abs enclitic (cf. chapter 3, section
3.1.3), while auxiliaries do. Also, the combinability of tak with auxiliaries is
restricted, while auxiliaries present some variation in their combinations (cf. section
4.2.1.3);ethe intensity particle yumane modifies other word classes besides verbs (cf. 3.3.1);ethe Causation particle ka displays flexible combination with auxiliaries:V Aux Caus ;V Caus Aux. The problem with saying that ka is also an auxiliary is that the
configuration of the causative construction in Trumai has a special characteristic:
when the causativized verb is Transitive, the construction has two Ergative NPs, the
causer and the causee. No clause with a Transitive verb modified by an auxiliary has a
similar configuration. The causation particle behaves as if it were a Transitive main
verb, presenting its own argument structure; however, ka cannot be called a verb for a
series of reasons (cf. chapter 8, section 8.1). Auxiliaries do not have an influence onthe argument structure of the clause where they occur. Therefore, if we include the
Causation morpheme ka in the class of auxiliaries, it has to be treated as a very
particular kind of auxiliary; but then, if ka is such a special form, is it really useful to
include it in the class of auxiliaries? If ka has to be differentiated from the other132auxiliaries, then it is better to treat it as not being an auxiliary. That is the position we
are assuming in our study.","[154, 155, 156, 157, 158]"
"3.2. Verbs
There is little verbal morphology in Trumai: the verb frequently bears the enclitic
-nl-e ‘3Abs’, but as already said before this enclitic can also occur with other elements
(cf. section 3.1.3). Some verbs may bear the prefix wa-, which seems to be a mark of
middle voice (cf. chapter 9 for details). There are no tense-aspect-mood affixes. Tense is
expressed through the use of adverbs or the two Focus/Tense particles ka in and chi in,
whose primary function is to highlight important information: ka in highlights
information in events happening now or in the recent past, chi in in events that happened
in the past (cf. chapter 5). When a clause has neither adverbs nor the Focus/Tenseparticles, tense is understood from context. Aspect and mood are expressed via auxiliaries99(cf. chapter 4). Finally, postverbal particles indicate negation, intensity, and causation (cf.
section 3.3).","[124, 125]"
"86CHAPTER 3
Verbs and Verb PhraseIn this chapter, we describe the structure of the verb phrase in Trumai and the
word classes that occur in it: verbs, auxiliaries, particles, and adverbs. In section 3.3, we
describe the intensity, causation, negation, and imperative particles. There is a special
section on adverbs, given that they can occur not only inside the VP, but also outside,
modifying the whole clause. The final section of this chapter is dedicated to the Copuia,
which does not occur in a VP (the Copula occurs in non-verbal predicates), but which istreated in this chapter in order to be contrasted with verbs.","[111, 112]"
"FocusBoth in and ka_in/ chi_in indicate ‘Focus’, but while in is dedicated only tofocus, ka_in and chi_in can give other information: they also indicate if the event being
described is occurring in the present or in the past; therefore, the units can be used to! For instance: “The essential piece of new information that is carried by a sentence will be referred to as its
focus.” (Comrie1981:63)173indicate the tense of the event, too. The unit ka in is used to indicate events in the present
time or recent past (i.e. the event happened just a short time ago and it is still alive in the
speaker’s mind), while chiin indicates events in a more distant past. The use of chiin is
more precise - it indicates only past events - while the use of ka in can generate some
ambiguity in the interpretation of the clause. Extralinguistic information, plus the use of
the adverbs, help to solve the ambiguity.

speak
‘I am speaking’ or ‘I spoke (today).’Given the characteristics of kKa_in and chi_in, we decided the call thesecombinations of morphemes ‘Focus/Tense’ particles. In the absence of a better
classification, the term ‘particle’ is used for ka_in and chi_in, given that they have such
peculiar behavior.”
Besides the function of indicating new or important information, the Focus/Tense
particles can also distinguish a clause from a phrase, as we can see in example (18b). The
Focus/Tense particles are in some way linked to predication; that is, while their function
is not exactly to indicate predication, since they modify arguments of a predicate, they
end up indicating predication too. Therefore, whenever their occurrence is attested, we
have the occurrence of a whole clause, not merely a phrase.","[198, 199]"
