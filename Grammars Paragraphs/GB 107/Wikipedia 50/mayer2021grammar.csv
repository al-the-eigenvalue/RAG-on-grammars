Figure 6 Verbal configuration including HAB.-moodAs mentioned above, the following sections will look at each verbal slot individually: The PRE
category and the habitual are discussed in section 4.2.1, SFX1 in section 4.2.2, tense-aspect in
section 4.2.3, and mood in section 4.2.5.
4.2.1 PRE & Habitual
As said above, the PRE affixes and the habitual are two distinct categories, but they are
discussed together in this section because of their formal similarities and small size. The PRE
category consists of the ventive and the negative. They are the only affixes that occur before
the verb root, and are also the only affixes that must always attach directly to it. However, they
are not formally identical, as the ventive is a prefix, and the negative is a circumfix. Similar to
the negative, the habitual is also a circumfix, but this affix always attaches to the first affix
after the verb root instead of on the verb root itself.
The ventive, m- VENT, can only attach to the first verb root of a verb complex. Its narrow
meaning is that the action takes place towards the current position of the speaker, but in some
instances it may also mean that the action takes places near or around the speaker, and that this
is relevant. The ventive occurs mostly on the verb root ə- ‘to go’, such as in the second verbal
complex in (62a), but it can also occur on other verb roots. As (62b) shows, the verb root does
is not required to have implied motion semantics.

cannot be said whether it is reserved to the first verb root of the verbal complex. The negative
circumfix only negates the verb itself, rather than having scope over the entire sentence. In (63)
this means that the verb je- ‘give’ is negated into an event of ‘not-giving’, rather sentential or
clausal negation. Negation with different scope, such as contrastive or focalized negation, is
carried out by the negative particle pam NEG (see section 4.4.2).","[53, 54]"

Western Sentani5Foreword
This Research Master’s thesis, a sketch grammar of the Sentani language, was born out of the
exceptional circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic prevented the
on-site fieldwork on a different Papuan language originally planned as my thesis project, and I
thus had to find an alternative project. Since I wanted to write a sketch grammar of a Papuan
language I contacted people from or in contact with people from New Guinea to see if there
were any native speakers of Papuan languages living in the Netherlands; I came into contact
with Gershon Kaigere, or Kələw nikíban, and together with him we were able to discuss the
Sentani language and collect the data on which this sketch grammar is based. I am extremely
grateful to have worked with my friend Gershon, and his knowledge and joy of language,
culture and life has taught me much about how to approach the study of language and myself.
Clemens Mayer
Leiden, 20211 Introduction
This chapter introduces the Sentani language, its dialects and speakers (section 1.1), and its
linguistic area (section 1.2), as well as the methodology and research data that form the basis
on which this sketch grammar is written (section 1.3). Sentani is an endangered and relatively
underdescribed language spoken around the Sentani Lakes area near Jayapura in western New
Guinea (see Figure 1).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"
"There is no morphological interaction between the markers in the SFX1 category and the other
categories. That is, there are no changes or restrictions to the options, paradigms and suffix
ordering as a result of the addition of a marker from a SFX1 marker.
Next is the PRE category (section 4.2.1), named such because they are the only category that
attaches to the front of the verb root. The category has two members: the ventive prefix, mVENT, which indicates motion towards the position of the speaker, and the negative circumfix,
ə- -j NEG, which negates the verb.

"The possessive prefixes may initially look like the regular independent pronouns,
phonologically reduced through fast speech, but the fact that, in cases where the possessed
noun does not start with a vowel, an epenthetic vowel, [ə], is inserted rather than the vowel
present in the independent pronouns (52b), in this case /e/, shows that this cannot be the case.

This, in combination with the optional double possession marking in the obligatorily possessed
nouns (53), shows that they are synchronically prefixes rather than phonologically reduced
independent pronouns. However, they are historically clearly related to the independent
pronouns and take their form from the first consonant of the respective independent pronoun.
This means that in some cases a pronominal distinction has been lost, for example for the first
46and second person plural, both of which are m-. This ambiguity is resolved by the use of
independent pronouns.

In addition to the nouns noted above, there is one instance of a lexical noun being possessively
prefixed, (54), but the speaker noted that, although it was grammatical, it was somewhat
strange. This may mean that either this possession construction is spreading to a broader set of
lexical nouns, or that the instance in (54) is a vestige of a previously widespread but now
restricted possession construction.

‘The man told him to be his pigs’ guard.’ (lit. ‘guard of pigs’4 Verbs and basic clauses
This chapter discusses the verb complex and the basic clause. By basic clause I mean the most
sentence construction, minimally consisting of one noun and one inflected verb complex
(although see section 4.3), which can function without context. This thus excludes complex
sentential operations such as complement clauses as well as discourse-based operations such
as tail-head linkage (which is very briefly discussed in section 5.3).
As said, the basic template of a full-fledged sentence is a (nominal) subject and a verb inflected
for tense. However, there are several constituents that can be added to expand this basic
template, such as objects, particles, or temporal/locational phrases:
[(particle) [(temporal/location phrase)] [subject] [(object(s))] verb (particle)]
Thus, the most standard word order is SOV. While the verb is typically also inflected for person
and number as well as mood, this is not strictly necessary. Additionally, the present tense is
unmarked, which means that, although the verbal complex can be very intricate and expansive,
very little morphology is obligatory. Of course, within context it is possible for a sentence to
consists only of a single lexical word, particle, or (inflected) verb. There is no dedicated case
marking on the nominal arguments, meaning that the assignment of syntactic roles is based on
context, pronominal case marking on the verb (55a), and constituent ordering (55b; although
see the use of locational enclitics to mark objects in section 3.3.1 above). In other words, the
role of a noun phrase is usually not explicitly marked on the noun phrase itself, but follows
from the other elements in a sentence.","[47, 48]"
"Another circumfix, which forms its own category, is the habitual j- -jə HAB. The difference
between the negative circumfix is that the habitual does not attach to the verb root, rather, it
attaches to the first suffix that follows the verb root, with the exception of the mood marker.",[53]

There are several non-lexical words that perform a number of functions. These can best be
subdivided into question words (section 4.4.1), which are used in the construction of content
question sentences, and the broader category of discourse particles (section 4.4.2), which have
diverse functions, but have similar syntactic properties.
4.4.1 Question words
There are four question words: hinə ‘what, who’, məka ‘why’, məhǽ ‘how’, and mbə ‘where’.
They are placed either in situ (83a), or at the front of the sentence to have scope over the whole
sentence (83b). Note that in the latter case, movement of the constituents is still possible, for
example fronting the subject for focalization as in (83c; interrogative constructions are further
discussed in section 5.1).

The general question particle hinə ‘what’ is a lexicalized root form of the verb hinə- ‘to ask’,
while the others are etymologically opaque. There are no morphological operations possible
on these particles save for the locational clitics, but the reduplicated form of məhǽ is the
(lexicalized) word for ‘how many’. Question constructions with question particles are always
content questions, rather than polar questions, meaning that the answer must be a sentence or
lexical item rather than əhə ‘yes’ or uuja ‘no’ (85; see section 5.1).

Both are discussed in more detail in section 5.1 below.
4.4.2 Discourse particles
The main functions of discourse particles are discourse organization and governing information
structure. They are typically placed after a noun or verb phrase, depending on their scope, in
order to modify certain elements, either temporally or information structurally. For example,
jæ EMPH, has many functions and can occur after virtually every element in a sentence in order
to emphasize it. For example, it can emphasize the temporal sequence of events (86a), or65marking an unexpected turn of events (86b). Multiple instances of jæ may appear in one
sentence, although not within one clause.

The other particles have functions within the realm of discourse organization, e.g. nə ‘then’

Additionally, it is used in an emphatic possessive construction to mean ‘not knowing’, possibly

5.1 Interrogation
Questions are generally created using the question words, which were briefly discussed in
section 4.4.1 above. The question words are: hinə ‘what’, məka ‘why’, məhǽ ‘how’, and mbə
‘where’, and they are placed either in situ, or at the beginning of a sentence. In the former
position, the question word indicates which element must be answered, either simply with the
lexical word that is being questioned (90b), or by repeating the sentence with the correct lexical
word replacing the question word (90c).

"74Particles are frequently used and can have several functions, such as emphasis, discourse
organization, or even adverb-like. Question words can function as particles or can be placed in
situ in an interrogative construction.
The unmarked word order is SOV, but all non-verbal constituents have the option to be moved,
depending on information structural processes.
There are three types of multi-verb constructions: Serial verb constructions, verbal compounds,
and Close Event Sequences. The latter is a construction that indicates that two events are
immediately sequential, but are distinct actions nonetheless, contrary to serial verb
constructions. They are characterized by two verb complexes, each in their own verbal clause,
with no interfering constituents.
While only being very briefly discussed in this grammar sketch, tail-head linkage is present in
Sentani and occurs regularly, although infrequently.
This sketch grammar has given an exploratory insight into the complexities of the Sentani
language. Many aspects of the language have been discussed, but for the vast majority of them
restrictions in data, the nature of the data collection and space a detailed and expansive analysis
was not possible. Thus, many areas of the language and its culture remain underexplored, such
as affix ordering, the exact function of particles, or multi-verb constructions, or completely
unexplored, such as complex clauses, most discourse-level processes, pragmatics, and
indigenous knowledge. Nonetheless, I believe that the sketch grammar contains interesting and
useful data and analyses, and provides many novel insights or re-analyses of previous linguistic
works published on Sentani, as well as a small amount of comparative historical phonology
that further supports the established Sentanic language family.","[75, 76]"

sentences, regardless of their construction, are usually accompanied by rising intonation, this

"614.2.5 Mood
There are three moods: indicative, imperative and irrealis. They are expressed as the indicative
mood suffix, -le IND, a change in the verbal suffix order, and an unmarked verb, respectively.
The indicative, which appears on by far the most verb complexes, indicates that the speaker is
convinced of the truth value of the event they are describing. However, it is not required that
the action in the event has finished or even has started, but simply that they are convinced that
the event in the sentence is true. Thus, the indicative is not bound by tense-aspect and occurs
in present, past, future tenses and in the imperfect aspect (76a-d, respectively). The indicative
mood suffix always attaches to the very end of the verb complex.

In an imperative construction the verb can consists minimally of a verb root and a subject
suffix, and maximally of that suffix, an object suffix, and an SFX1 suffix. The subject marker
always attaches directly to the root, with the SFX1 marker, if present, being placed after it,
overriding the suffix ordering required in an indicative verb formation and the suffix
paradigms. As (77a,b) shows, the imperative mood is mutually exclusive with the indicative
mood.

Cowan (1965) notes that the imperative can also occur for the first person with an adhortative
meaning, but this does not occur in my data, and is thus probably quite rare. The construction
62does, however, occur with a third person subject in an optative meaning (78). In this instance
the subject is morphologically singular, but referentially unspecified and contextually plural,
as (78) is an order directed towards servants.

The irrealis is unmarked both morphologically and in suffix ordering. It is called the irrealis
because, in contrast to the indicative, it is used when the speaker is unsure whether something
has or will happen. It occurs mainly in question sentences (79a), but also in desiderative
construction (79b), in which case it is combined with future tense. Note that hinə is used both
as a general question particle (see section 4.4.1) as well as a verb root, hinə- ‘to ask’ or ‘to
question’.

4.3 Clauses with non-verbal predication
Existential, identifying and equative constructions consist of a subject and a nominal predicate.
The construction has subject-predicate order, and both the subject and the predicate NPs can
have varying levels of complexity:

‘Awansi is a girl.’b. Awansi

it can be a complex NP, a possessed NP, or a nominal predicate. When there is more context,
and/or the construction more complex, as in (81b), word order can disambiguate the
interpretation, in addition to prosodical clues.

jakobá

[Kələw Nikíban [Ohəj jakobá]
ondofolo]
PN
Asei

chief
‘Kələw Nikíban is the chief of Asei island.’
For (81b), were ondofolo ‘chief’ to be placed directly after Kələw Nikíban, thus directly
modifying it, that noun phrase’s meaning would be ‘Kələw Nikíban is a chief’, and the
interpretation of the whole sentence would be difficult, but Ohəj jakobá ‘Asei village’ could
be interpreted as a locational argument.
Another way to disambiguate is using pronouns from different sets (see section 3.2), which
either emphasize the possessive nature and excludes an identifying construction (82a) or
emphasize the subject to indicate that it is not a possessive construction (82b):

The above template is subject to many changes and movements since constituent order is
variable dependent on the assignment of syntactic roles and information structural operations.
Additionally, distinctions between intransitive, transitive and ditransitive verbs are semanticsbased, formally not being distinguished, but contextually by (implicit) object arguments and
optional object marking(s) on the verb.
Section 4.1 discusses the word order, section 4.2 details the intricate verb complex including
the ventive marker, verbal negation and the habitual (4.2.1), markers of affectedness and
directionality (4.2.2), tense-aspect (4.2.3), person-number marking (4.2.4) and mood (4.2.5),
and finally clauses with non-verbal predication (4.3) and particles (4.4).
4.1 Word order and focus
Although the most unmarked word order is SOV, word order in Sentani is quite free, with all
non-verbal constituents having at least some maneuverability dependent on information
structure. While all non-verbal constituents can and do move frequently, the verb itself cannot
move. That is to say, in some cases the object is placed after the verb (56a),23 or a particle is
placed after the verb to indicate its sentence-level scope (56b) to focalize the respective
element, but the verb itself stays in place. Additionally, a locational clitic can be attached to
the verb when a locational referent is un(der)specified, which indicates that the action takes
place in a direction from or to some location, but that this location is not relevant to the
discourse (56c).

Mass nouns are distinguished from other nouns in that they cannot be quantified by numerals.
They generally denote things that are either physically uncountable, such as pu ‘water’, or a
general term for a foodstuff, e.g. fi ‘sago’. It is, however, still possible for the locational clitics
to be attached to the noun phrase containing the mass noun (25a), as well as modify it with an
adjective (25c). Additionally, the mass noun can serve as the modifier for another noun, and
the resulting compound takes on the noun class of the left-most element in the noun phrase, i.e.
the head (25d). The noun phrase is further discussed in section 3.3 below.

Personal names are often based on other, lexical, nouns or noun phrases, but are distinguished
from them morpho-syntactically in that they cannot possessed, and semantically in that they
can function as the agent argument in a clause regardless of the animacy of the lexical noun(s).
Sentani people often have two names: one Sentani name, to ‘man, name’, usually referred to
with Ind. nama tanah ‘land name’, and one Biblical name, although the former are becoming
less frequent. The Sentani names can change throughout one’s life, for example due to major
achievements, and consist of either a single noun, a noun plus an adjective, or two adjectives.
They generally have positive meanings, describing something considered beautiful, e.g. kələw
nikíban ‘Morningstar’ (lit. ‘spotless glimmer’), or something having positive properties, e.g.
aje rəmbu ‘owl’. However, not all personal names are contemporarily based on other nouns:
for example, Onsá and Awansi are ancestral names with no further meanings contemporarily
and Kambu, which originally meant ‘root’, is now a (nick)name given to a chief.19 In this
grammar, personal names are distinguished from their non-name counterparts with
capitalization.
While two juxtaposed nouns may be read as an attributive noun phrase, possessive noun phrase,
or an existential clause (see section 4.3), a personal name can only be read as simple noun
phrase (26a-b).

"8consisted of weekly visits of about two hours to the speaker’s home, reading and/or translating
stories, discussing semantics, or eliciting lexemes and paradigms (for a discussion of types and
strategies of elicitation see section 1.3.2). The reason I conducted the fieldwork in the
Netherlands rather than at the Sentani Lakes was due to the impossibility of foreign travel
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to this pandemic, I took extra care to conduct the sessions
in a safe manner, which included attentive health monitoring for both myself and the speaker,
keeping distance, as well as postponing the sessions when cases spiked, e.g. for several weeks
in December 2020.
While I usually broadly planned the sessions, e.g. checking phonemes, elicitation and
discussion of some semantic domain, translation, etc., often with a sheet of questions or topics,5
I allowed a loose structure in order to create a natural flow, which significantly increased the
amount of valuable data collected (see section 1.3.2 below).
The two stories used in this sketch grammar (see Appendix A), which were previously written
down by other authors; one (Cowan 1965) in the Eastern Dialect, and one (Onde et al. 1979)
in the Central Dialect. They were first read aloud by the speaker, which was recorded.
Subsequently, the speaker and I went through the text line by line, where he translated each
line and gave corrections where necessary. The corrections were in most cases either a mistake
in the original orthography6 or substituting a word for a more commonly used one in the Eastern
Dialect. While in the vast majority of cases there were already recorded instances of these
words, if there were any unrecorded ones they would be noted and included in the following
session(s) in order to not interrupt the translation workflow. In order to best facilitate the
speaker’s linguistic abilities, the speaker translated the Sentani text into Malay, which I
subsequently translated to English. Of the stories, the first is the biblical story of the Prodigal
Son (Luke 15:11-32), which was written down in the Eastern Dialect by Cowan (1965), and
the second is a traditional story about Ebalə Jakali, a folk hero trickster who is the main
character of several stories (Cowan 1952b), which was originally written down in the Central
Dialect, but adapted to the Eastern Dialect during the translation process.
All sessions were conducted in a mix of Dutch and Malay as contact languages.7 In the case of
reading stories, discussing semantics and elicitation, the sessions were recorded on audio and
video using a Sony HDR-CX625 Camcorder and a Sennheiser MKE 400 attachable
microphone. While the video recorder was planned to be set up to capture both the mouth and
hands, there are several recordings where the former was not accurately captured due to the
positioning of the recorder. The recorded video files were converted to .mp4 files using
Windows Video Editor as well as a separate, audio-only .wav file using Audacity, which were
consequently stored in a personal and secure OneDrive.8 The total of recorded data is around
8 hours, but it must be emphasized that the amount of Sentani language data is relatively low
in the majority of these recordings. The recordings were subsequently transcribed and
5This sheet was usually kept by the speaker in order to go over and (re)consider what was discussed that session.
The texts were read and translated from their originally given orthography, but I have updated them to the
orthography used in this sketch. The corrections in the original mostly were regarding the removal of spaces for
clitics.

The speaker expressed an explicit dislike of the term ‘Indonesian’ or ‘Bahasa Indonesia’ and preferred (Indo)Malay. While I mainly spoke Standard Indonesian, the speaker spoke Papua Malay (see Kluge 2014), to which I
tried to adapt in cases where there were structural differences.

an Excel master sheet, and later the ELAN files were imported into a FLEx database. In total,
excluding the stories, there are around 1200 transcribed utterances, ranging from single words
to short sentences, with many repetitions.
The ample periods between recording sessions allowed me to transcribe and briefly analyze the
previous sessions, and prepare the next session based on this. This was a large boon, since it
allowed me to analyze not only what linguistic areas to pursue further, but also to assess what
stimulated the speaker’s linguistic ability, and, crucially, what did not (further detailed in
section 1.3.2 below). Additionally, I used information from the works published on Sentani in
the past both to prepare further areas of inquiry as well as to corroborate analyses in this sketch
grammar. I emphatically note that none of the analyses in presented in this work were given
without testing them either to/with the speaker directly, or sourcing corroborating evidence
from the previously data collected by myself. However, it must also of course be emphasized
that the collected data are from a single speaker who has been living outside of his linguistic
context for several decades.
Initially, I tried to come to an agreement with the speaker about monetary compensation, he
adamantly refused any money whenever I raised the point, stating that speaking and working
with the language was enough for him. Thus ‘compensation’ only consisted of giving the
speaker bound copies of all Sentani-language material I have found, as well as helping out with
small (technological) issues around the house such as setting up an internet connection. The
speaker signed an informed consent form (formulated in understandable language) which was
scanned and is stored in the aforementioned OneDrive.
1.3.2 The speaker, his language attrition, and its effects on this sketch
As stated above, the data were collected with a single speaker of the Eastern Sentani dialect
living in Leiden, the Netherlands. He has been living in the Netherlands since 1962, before
which he was already working as a medical professional in mainly non-Sentani language
contexts. Sentani is his first language, being born on Pulau Ase [Asei Island], but he was only
fully immersed in the language context until about nine or ten years old. After this, he moved
to nearby Hollandia (now Jayapura/Port Numbay) to pursue further education, and
consequently worked in healthcare in Hollandia and the surrounding regions. His emigration
to the Netherlands in 1962 was not planned to be permanent, as he was only supposed to go
there for further education, with a supposed return in 1963. Due to the hostile socio-political
environment that occurred after the withdrawal of the Dutch government from western New
Guinea, he has not been able to return. This lack of socio-cultural and linguistic context for
Sentani, in combination with the bilingualism means that he has had few chances to speak
Sentani outside of a few words for decades.
At the beginning of the fieldwork, I quickly noticed that production of lexical items posed the
main challenge to the speaker, while inflection, paradigms, and their explanation were much
easier: The speaker showed immediately that he had a keen understanding of not only the
semantics in Sentani morphological structure and function words, but also how these may differ
from Dutch and/or Malay. Understandably, the confrontation of not being able to recall certain
words in his first language was emotional and frustrating, so I quickly moved away from asking
for direct translations. Rather, I tried to explore semantic domains and phonological contexts
with the speaker, prompting things such as “are there other things like this?”, “what else is
10there to eat?”, or “are there any words that sound like this?” and “are there any words that start
with this sound?”. This proved to be even more effective than visual stimuli (pictures), since
the (semi-)free association meant he was less restricted in word choice. When working through
the stories, there was not a single instance in which the speaker did not know how to translate
a specific lexical item, and many of them, e.g. toboni ‘beads, currency, often given as a bride
price’, prompted extensive cultural explanations of their place and function in daily life.
Thus, the speaker has abundant cultural and sociolinguistic knowledge, but shows heavy signs
of language attrition. As laid out above, his passive linguistic knowledge as well as his event
and concept construal show confidence and is generally corroborated by the other available
data, but active production is a much larger challenge.9 In this, he follows the generally
established pattern in language attrition, meaning the areas that ‘remain’ can be taken as valid
linguistic judgements (see Hutz 2004 and references therein). I am keenly aware of the possible
problematic nature of the data that I collected as a result of this, i.e. the relatively low amount
of natural speech, which I took into account in each step of the analysis.","[9, 10, 11, 12]"
"42It may also very well be the case that these postpositions in turn stemmed from verb roots, but
much more (comparative) data are required in order to establish this, and the hypothesis above
as well.
3.3.2 Adjectives
Adjectives are placed after the noun they modify. While they generally cannot occur by
themselves, in cases where there is enough context, the noun can be elided. Additionally, there
are some adjectives, such as fa ‘young’, that can occur by themselves with a predetermined
meaning regardless of context (45a). In the same vein, some compounds consist of two
adjectives, the result of which functions as a noun (45b).

nunde-w-bo-kə-le=ra
young get.lost-E-AU-PST-IND=FROM
‘A little boy got lost.’
b. kələw
nikíban
glimmering spotless
‘Morningstar’
Adjectives can be (fully) reduplicated, although this happens infrequently. The resulting
meaning is augmentative to the original meaning, e.g. kələw ‘glimmering’ vs. kələw-kələw
‘continuously glimmering’. Some adjectives, such as moj-moj ‘kind’, seem to be a clearly
reduplicated form, but there is no corresponding unreduplicated form. In some cases, the
unreduplicated form may have been present previously and has since been lost, but in other
cases, such as (46), the adjective likely has an ideophonic origin.

Non-numeral quantifiers, as mentioned above, are formally the same as. By this I mean that
their syntactic position in the NP is exactly that as occupied by adjectives (47a,b). In cases
where the quantifier occurs only with an adjective, such as in the (lexicalized) greeting phrase
in (47c), it is placed before the adjective. Lastly, multiple non-numeral quantifiers can be
placed after each other as well (47d)

3.3.3 Numerals
Sentani has a base-four numeral system based on the hands. That is to say, the first four
numerals are base forms, while larger numbers are complex. For example, məhǽ-mbaj ‘five’
consists of mə ‘hand’, hæ ‘with’ and mbaj ‘one’, and məhini-pe ‘seven’ of mə, hi ‘other’ and
=nə IN. The first numeral also functions as an indefinite determiner, especially for introducing
human referents in the discourse with the phrase to mbaj ‘a man/person’. In everyday language,
Indonesian numerals are generally used, especially for larger numbers.

3.3.4 Possession
There are three ways to express possession in Sentani: juxtaposition, emphatically possessive
pronouns, and possessive prefixes. These ways are grammatically not mutually exclusive and
can be combined with one another.
The simplest way to express possession, often employed when the possessor is a lexical noun,
is by juxtaposing the possessor and the possessed (49a). The ordering runs contrary to the
general noun phrase ordering in that the possessor precedes the possessed, i.e. the modifier
precedes the head. When the possession is not emphasized, one of the unmarked pronouns can
also be used in a juxtaposition (49b). Additionally, when the possessor is clear through the
context, the possessor can be left out altogether (49c).

One of these juxtaposed possessive constructions, name the possessed u ‘body’, has been
conventionalized and is used in contexts where the body of the referent is emphasized:

‘In the morning, Ebalə Jakali dressed himself like a woman.’45The second way to express possession is the emphatically possessed pronoun paradigm, as was
already discussed in section 3.2 above. In addition to emphasizing the possessive relation, see
(51a), it can also disambiguate it from a nominal predicate construction (see section 4.3). It is
also common to express possession in an appositional construction; first introducing the lexical
referent, and then using the possessive pronoun (51b).

Since these constructions are relatively rare outside of conventionalized exchanges, such as the
greeting in (93a), it is unknown whether the emphatic particle is a strict requirement for
question sentences that feature a verb, which also obscures whether the indicative marker is
present or not in (93b). The lack of emphatic particle in (94b) may indicate its optionality, but
this cannot be taken as definitive evidence at this time.","[69, 70]"
"The table shows that stress regularly falls on the first mora of the right-most foot. If this foot
consists of two light syllables, each having one mora, the stress is thus placed on the first
syllable. If the foot consists of one heavy syllable, stress is assigned in a similar way, i.e., on
the first mora, landing on the vowel, stressing the syllable as a whole. This works for the
majority of word forms, but some run into problems: For example, in a disyllabic word
consisting of a heavy and a light syllable, e.g., CVC.CV, stress cannot be assigned to the
penultimate mora, since this is a consonant. In these cases, stress is then assigned to the final
mora, showing that the rule for not stressing the first syllable is stronger than the preference of
not having stress on the final mora. Conversely, if both syllables in the word are heavy, there
is no such clash and stress can be assigned regularly to the penultimate mora, landing on the
final syllable. To clarify, this restriction is specifically for disyllabic words where the first
syllable is heavy, if the heavy syllable is not word-initial, e.g., CV.CVC.CV, the stress can be
placed on the heavy syllable without any issues.
To summarize, stress in Sentani is assigned to syllable containing the penultimate mora, unless
this is the first syllable of the word, in which case it is placed on the following syllable.
The last four forms in Table 15 show non-penultimate stress that cannot be explained by the
regular stress pattern. While Onsá PN and məɦǽ ‘who’ can be explained by that personal names
and function words more often behave differently than other word-types, jakobá ‘island’ and
kelá ‘area’ cannot be explained this way. Although it is currently unclear, I suspect that these
are historically complex forms and/or contractions.
In order to explain, at least in part, why heavy syllables have this influence on stress
assignment, we must turn to the formation of the highly restricted CVC syllables to explain the
current forms. As we have seen in section 2.2.1 above, there are two sets of rules that have led
to the appearance of CVCnasal and CVCglide syllables. In both cases the original stress has not
27moved, but rather the lexeme has resyllabified without changing the number of mora’s. This
can be proven contemporarily by creating contexts in which stress is moved, since, as we have
seen above, stress is assigned on the word-level. This is difficult on non-verbs, since there is
very little non-verbal morphology that can be used to create these contexts, but looking at verbs
that show non-penultimate stress in one form can show that the stress assignment does in
actuality follow the regular penultimate pattern, by adding additional suffixation. For example,
while the basic imperative form nəkəj ‘sit!’ has ultimate stress, the more complex form nəkəjbo
‘keep sitting!’ follows the regular pattern and has penultimate stress. Initially it may seem that
the stress is linked to the final syllable, but (22) shows that the regular stress pattern is observed
in cases with additional morphology.

naThis pattern, where atypical stress in the imperative verb form disappears with additional
suffixation, is found in all instances where the imperative form is disyllabic, following the
regular stress assignment rules. This does not necessarily mean that it applies to all disyllabic
verb roots as some of roots (of varying length) always require additional morphology (23),
making a disyllabic form impossible. This also means that ultimate stress can be excluded as a
feature of the imperative.

To summarize, the analysis can be distilled into three processes that explain both emergence
of nasals and glides in the syllable coda, and the seemingly atypical stress assignment in some
word forms. The processes are, chronologically ordered, as follows:
A. Vowel deletion after nasals in from pre-proto-Nuclear-Sentanic onwards led to the
emergence of nasals in syllable codas, creating the syllable type CVCnasal.
1. CV1CnasalV1 > CV1Cnasal
i. /kanapu/ > *kanpu > [ˈkam.bu] ‘root’
B. The deletion of /ə/ after a glide or nasal in proto-Sentani-Nafri led to the emergence of
glide in syllable codas, creating the syllable types CVCglide and CVCnasal.
1. *CVCnasal/glideVə > CVCnasal/glide
i. *nəkənˈdəjə > /nəkənˈdəj/ > [nə.xən.ˈdəj] ‘mosquito’
ii. *kənˈdiNə > /kəndin/ > [kən.ˈdiŋ] ‘small’
C. Regular penultimate stress is not reassigned in the forms resulting from either A. or B.,
creating surface forms with ultimate stress.
1. (*)/CV.ˈCV.Cnasal/glideV/ > CV.ˈCVCnasal/glide
These three processes explain that forms that may seem to break the regular penultimate stress
assignment pattern in Sentani, the forms are actually the result of (historical) phonological
developments and underlyingly do follow the regular stress assignment. While it is difficult to
pinpoint whether A. or B. has had the largest effect on the instances of CVC nasal, comparative
28data shows that A. must precede B., since the latter is proposed only from proto-Sentani-Nafri
onwards.
Since there is little contemporary data on the Sentanic languages, and the historical sources
discuss stress or mark it stress in their orthographies, it remains to be seen whether penultimate
stress assignment is a feature of proto-Sentanic and thus of the Sentanic family as a whole.","[28, 29, 30]"

In summary, the markers in the SFX1 category are the first suffix that follows the verb root, in
regular circumstances, and consist of two functional categories: One emphasizing different
forms of affectedness, and one emphasizing the direction in which the action takes place.
Almost all markers in this cateogry seem to stem from previous verb roots or nominal
compounds, but they are no longer formally connected to these, and a number of them have
also started to move from their literal meanings to more grammatical, abstract meanings. Due
to their varied origin and in some cases highly specific meaning, it is possible that further SFX1
markers will be found in the future.
4.2.3 Tense-aspect
In this category, there is a functional overlap between tense and aspect. This does not
necessarily mean that there are markers that express both tense and aspect, but that they express
either tense or aspect while belonging to the same formal category. Of the four markers, three
express tense, the present, past and future, while one expresses aspect: the imperfect. The
present tense is unmarked, and can thus be recognized by the absence of any of the other tense
markers (72a). The past tense and the imperfect aspect are both marked with a suffix, -kə PST
(72b) and -wo IMPF (72c) respectively, which is placed after the SFX1 marker and before the
subject and object markers and/or mood marker. It could be argued that the imperfect aspect
occurs together with the present tense, but since it is mutually exclusive with and occurs in the
same position as the past tense, and there is no further formal ‘aspect’ category, it must be
analyzed as part of the same category as the tenses.
The future tense, as is further discussed in section 4.2.4 below, consists of a dedicated
pronominal subject suffix paradigm, which combines syntactic role, person and number, and
tense (72d). The future tense is also used to indicate desire rather than strictly tense.

‘Awansi will come to you all.’The vowel of the past tense marker is often obscured due to assimilation or vowel harmony,
most frequently with a third person singular, i.e. unmarked, subject in the combination /kə-le/
PST-IND, which surfaces as [ke]. Similarly, the vowel of the imperfect marker is obscured when
the following suffix starts with a vowel. However, due to their predictable position and their
consonants remaining relatively robust, there are few instances of ambiguity tense-wise, in
which instance the context usually resolves it.
4.2.4 Person-number Marking
There are several pronominal paradigms for both subject and object suffixes. The subject
paradigms are divided into a neutral, non-future paradigm (Table 29), and the future paradigm
which combines person and tense marking (Table 30).

Table 30 Sentani future subject suffixes (Adapted from Elenbaas 1999, 54)The object paradigms are divided along similar, but crucially different lines: The first paradigm
is used when the subject is first or second person singular and the sentence is in a non-future
tense (Table 31), and the second paradigm is used for third person singular subject, plural
subject, and future tense (Table 32). (73) shows both paradigms:

Table 32 Sentani object suffixes for future, third person singular subject, or plural subjectIn addition to using separate object suffix paradigms, the order of the subject and object suffixes
is reversed along the same conditions. If a sentence is in future tense and/or has a third person
singular or plural subject, the order is subject-object (74a), but if it is in first or second person
singular subject and not in the future tense the order is object-subject (74b). Since the latter is
more restricted I assume that this is the marked affix order, while the former is the unmarked.

‘I have said something to you.’This occurs in the vast majority of cases, but there are some cases in which constructions that

This is because the imperative construction requires the subject marker to be attached directly
to the root, which overrides the ordering due to the subject configuration. The imperative is
further discussed in section 4.2.5 below. Additionally, if the syntactic subject is first or second
person singular, but the verb is unmarked for subject and marked for object, the ‘unmarked’
object paradigm, i.e. the one from Table 32, is used. This shows that this is a morphological
alternation rather than one based on semantics.","[59, 60, 61, 62]"
"71expressing motion, this does not seem to be a prerequisite to the construction, since either the
first, the second or both can contain the motion verb.

Further research can reveal whether the presence of a motion verb is a strict requirement of the
construction or if it is prevalent due to the semantic circumstances, e.g. it is required to move
to a certain location in order to speak to someone. Additionally, a Close Event Sequence can
consist of more than two verb complexes, as shown in (99b), but this is relatively rare.

Due to the nature of this sketch grammar, it is not possible to go into much detail about supraclausal aspects of the language, such as referent tracking, discourse organization or narrative
styles. In this section, however, I will give a very brief overview of a few strategies used in
narratives to link clauses. Discourse particles are frequently used to continue a narrative and/or
link two clauses, and some of their functions have been discussed in section 4.4.2. Additionally,
temporal indications, such as ja mbaj ‘one day’ and jahimo ‘the next day’28 can serve to
progress the time in a narrative, but demonstratives are also very prominently used, especially
the general demonstrative pele DEM. While in some cases they function to track referents
established in the previous sentence (100a-b), they can also be used more generally, for
example in the often occurring pelena ‘then’, which consists of the demonstrative and the
general static locational enclitic =na AT (100c-d).","[72, 73]"
"The enclitics express a spatial relation to the noun phrase, indicating (to) where an action takes
place. When movement is implied, i.e. =rə TO, =re TWDS, and =ra FROM, they are most often
combined with a verb that includes motion/movement semantics, but this is not a strict
necessity (as is shown below). It is clear from Table 22 that there is a functional overlap, as
there are two clitics that cover ‘general’ movement and static location, =rə TO and =na AT,
respectively. This means that, in instances where the exact locational relation is not emphasized
(or is clear from the context), they are somewhat interchangeable. For example, both imæ=na
‘house=AT’ and imæ=nə ‘house=IN’ mean ‘in the house’, but the former can also mean ‘on the
house’, ‘at the house’ or ‘near the house’, whereas the latter can only mean ‘in the house’ or
‘touching/attached to the house’. The majority of combinations of the locational clitics,
however, are clearly mutually exclusive (41a-b), and in some instances there is a subtle
difference in meaning due to the context, meaning that they are also not interchangeable (42ab).

‘A dog came to me (at my feet).’
Interestingly, there is a clear subdivision in the locational clitics regarding their form and
function: One category, =rə TO, =re TWDS, and =ra FROM, involves movement to or from, and
the other, =na AT and =nə IN, denotes a static location. The categories each share an initial
phoneme, [t]21 and [n], respectively. Interestingly, there is also an overlap in the vowels
between the two categories, although this is not perfect since the static category is smaller.
In addition to this, one of the clitics, =re TWDS, has a more semantically extended function, in
which it disambiguates the object argument, without necessarily being congruent with the
locational semantics of the verb complex or action. Ambiguous here means that the syntactic
roles are not clear from the verbal marking or context, or the syntactic roles are unexpected or
marked. For example, when a speech-act participant (SAP; first and second person) and a third
person or lexical noun are present in a sentence, the expected scenario is that the SAP acts upon
the third person or noun (43a). If, however, this is not the case, the SAP is marked with the
clitic =re TWDS to indicate this object status (43b), since the word order does not provide
enough context to disambiguate the syntactic roles, since the non-SAP could have been fronted.
As (43a,b) show, the ‘unexpected object’ is marked even when the verb complex has overt
subject/object marking.

"6 Summary and Conclusion
To summarize this grammar sketch and give an overview of the elements of the Sentani
language discussed therein is a short typological overview of the language.
Sentani is a Papuan language consisting of three dialects, West, East, and Central, belonging
to the Sentanic family, and is spoken in northern New Guinea on and around Lake Sentani. It
has seven vowels, /i, e, æ, ə, a, u, o/ and eleven consonants, /p, m, f, t, n, s, l, j, k, w, ɦ/.
Especially the consonants have considerable allophony depending on their phonological
context, which in some instances occurs across word boundaries, and position in the word.
There is a relatively small number of syllable types, V, CV, CVCglide and CVCnasal, the latter
two of which have arisen relatively recently due to easily detectable phonological change.
Underived words consist of minimally one and maximally three syllables, but a prosodic word
can be up to six syllables, and eight moras. Primary stress is mora-based trochaic penultimate,
which means that stress is placed on the penultimate syllable, unless the final syllable is heavy,
i.e. CVCglide or CVCnasal, in which case stress is regularly placed on the final syllable.
Nominal morphology is minimal, with the only morphemes available to most nouns being the
locational enclitics which attach to the noun phrase. One of these locational clitics, the
‘direction towards’ marker =re TWDS, is showing grammaticalization towards becoming an
object marker. There is a small number of obligatorily possessed nouns, chiefly kinship terms,
which have pronominal possessive prefixes. The noun phrase is head-initial. There are three
sets of independent pronoun, one neutral, one emphasizing subject, and one emphasizing
possession. The pronouns of the first person plural has an inclusive and exclusive pronoun, and
there is no distinction in number for the third person pronouns.
Verbal morphology, on the other hand, is very elaborate. There is one prefix, two circumfixes,
and a large number of suffixes, and, in some contexts, the locational enclitics can attach to the
verb complex as well. The verb complex template contains five slots in which several markers
can be put. These slots are categorized according to their formal properties, as in some cases
formally identical markers belong to different functional categories. Functional categories
include affectedness, movement, habitual, tense-aspect, mood, and person-number marking.
Most slots can only be occupied by one marker, but there can be up to three person-number
marking suffixes on each verb root. Two verb roots can occur in a single verb complex, but in
this case only the final verb root is fully inflected. Existential, identifying and equative
constructions are verbless clauses that consist of a subject and a nominal predicate; there are
no copulas or auxiliary verbs, although one verb ə- ‘go’ seems to be moving in this direction,
albeit currently only within the verb complex.",[75]
"1.3 Methodology
This grammar sketch is mainly based on work done with a single speaker, Gershon Kaigere, 4
who has been living outside of a Sentani language context for a substantial time. Thus, several
additional considerations to ‘regular’ documentation, detailed in the following section, had to
be made to ensure the quality of the data, as well as working with the speaker to improve his
linguistic confidence and ability.
1.3.1 The data & data collection
The data used as a foundation of this sketch grammar were collected with one speaker of
Sentani in Leiden, the Netherlands, in the period between September 2020 and May 2021. It3This article only contains an abbreviated version of the story, but the unpublished manuscript by Kaigere (n.d.)
gives a more detailed overview, including a chronology and more place names

Gershon has given explicit permission for his name being used in this work.",[9]
"Some kinship terms are also semantically extended for a more general reading. For example,
aka ‘older brother’ is combined with the demonstrative pækə DEM to address a gathered group
of people as in (28).

‘Ladies and gentlemen, you all together, thank you for coming here.’
The vast majority of obligatorily possessed nouns are kinship terms, as body parts do not
require possession, but there is one non-kinship noun that is obligatorily possessed without
exception: ataj ‘knowledge’. This noun is used in the constructions for knowing and not
knowing, which always requires an independent pronoun and a possessive prefix on the noun.
For this noun, unlike the obligatorily possessed kinship terms, there is no possibility for an
underspecified or general possessor, and the possessive prefix must thus always be congruent
with the (specified) referent (29a-c).

3.1.5 Temporal/locational nouns & demonstratives
Temporal nouns appear in variable positions throughout the sentence (see section 4.1) and do
not function as arguments to the verb complex, but they are syntactically the head of an NP.
This means that the locational clitics (see section 3.3.1) can be attached to them (30a). The
temporal NP, however, cannot be extended with further elements besides particles, meaning
that they cannot take adjectives nor be possessed.

Locational nouns can also take the locational clitics. Contrary to temporal nouns, however,
they can appear in complex NPs as they can modify nouns (31a). In cases where the (relative)
location is emphasized, a possessed locational noun may appear instead of the common noun,
for example (31b) where puma ‘top’ is used instead of jam ‘roof’.

DEM.DISTTable 20 Sentani DemonstrativesThey cannot formally be distinguished from nouns as they can take all nominal morphology,
such as the locational clitics, and, interestingly, the possessive prefixes in certain contexts (32ab). However, they form a subcategory within the word class as they do have several restrictions
compared to common nouns: They do not appear as the head in a complex NP, and they cannot
35take a lexical possessor or adjectives. Examples (32ab) also show that a demonstrative is not
strictly required if an underspecified ending point is implied by the verbal semantics, as in this
example the demonstratives indicate the origin. However, verbal morphology can give further
deictic information about the ending point (in this case the ventive m- VENT; see section 4.2.1).

Additionally, the demonstratives can be in a complex NP, in which they precede the modified
noun (33a), as well as form an NP by themselves and function as an argument (33b). This is
restricted to the object argument only, but it can undergo further information structural
operations such as focalization (33c). The difference in order between (33a) and (33b) in
addition to the attachment of the locational clitic is what distinguishes demonstratives in
complex NP from those that form an NP by themselves.

There is a number of exocentric compounds which generally denote the broader semantic class
of the members (35a,b). Because compounds function as one phonological unit, they are
marked with a hyphen to indicate this status.
(35) a. obo-joku
obo joku
pig dog
‘Animal(s)’
b. to-mijǽ
to
mijæ
man woman
‘people’
c. abu-ako
abu
ako
grandfather friend
‘grandparent(s), family’
For (35c) there are several ways in which the compound is semantically extended: It is used to
refer to a non-specific grandparent or both grandparents, but also for direct family. Other
compounds are endocentric, meaning that one of the nouns modifies the other for the resulting
meaning. This is differentiated from other modified NPs by the fact that both members are
nouns, and that they are in turn modified as a whole (36a).
(36) a. moni-maj
kabam
[[moni maj]
kabam]
hunger disaster big
‘great famine’
b. obo kabam
obo kabam
pig big
‘big pig’
In some cases, the form only appears as a compound, with the meaning of the individual words
being lost (37a). While the original meanings cannot be retrieved, they cannot be assumed to
historically be a single lexical noun, since these are never longer than three syllables. This also
occurs on reduplicated forms, where the meaning of the original noun has been lost (37b).
(37) a. kəte-nalə
‘possessions’
b. mohi-mohi
‘dirt, refuse’373.2 Pronouns
There are three sets of independent pronouns and one set of possessive prefixes in Sentani (see
Table 21).

najtmwmn-Table 21 Sentani pronoun setsSet I contains the unemphasized pronouns, these are the most neutral pronouns and thus occur
often in discourse where enough context is present to have established referents. They are also
the set of pronouns most often used in object position, optionally with a locational clitic. Set II
are the emphatic pronouns, underlyingly consisting of a pronominal base and the emphatic
particle jæ. It is used in situations with little context or in a corrective/contrastive manner. In
practice, these occur very frequently in sentences that are uttered in isolation or otherwise have
little context, but are much less frequent in discourse. Both sets I and II can fulfil all syntactic
roles, and can function as possessors; their use depends on the information structure of the
sentence. Set III are the pronouns that are emphasized for possession. While all pronouns can
function as possessives, the ones in set III emphasizes the possessive relation. Additionally,
pronouns in set III can express the referent as being the direct object in a ditransitive
construction, since there is no specific morphology marking the different roles in these
constructions, which can thus resolve ambiguities (38ab). Pronouns from set III cannot occur
as the subject argument or as the object argument in a transitive construction, where the
possessed lexeme is left out. In cases where it is ambiguous whether it is a sentence with a nonverbal predicate or a possessive construction, the choice between a pronoun from set I or III
can be used to disambiguate (see section 4.3).

"48must attach to an overt constituent. If the clitic were to attach to fa ‘young’, this would imply
that this is the location (object) argument, and thus cannot occur. Therefore, the clitic moves
to the ‘post-verb focal position’ and attaches to the verb (see section 3.3.1 for further discussion
of the locational clitics).
For the subject and object constituents, the most typical movement is the fronting of the object
constituent in order to focalize it. This differs from the post-verbal position in that it does not
necessarily emphasize the undergoer status, i.e. emphasizing that the action takes place unto
this argument, but rather discourse-level focalization, such as in a contrastive sentence, or when
it is unexpected in the context. Where (57a) is in an unmarked constituent ordering and thus
gives a standard reading, (57b) indicates “I have said something to you, as opposed to someone
else”, giving contrastive focus to the object. Since the subject’s standard position is often
already sentence-initial, focalization of the subject is achieved with particles rather than
movement (see section 4.4.2). However, if a temporal/locational noun phrase is present, and
thus the subject is no longer sentence-initial in unmarked word order, this movement can still
take place, as in (57c).

is the same as the agent. It occurs chiefly in intransitive clauses (68a), but can also occur in
transitive clauses (68b,c). In the latter instances, the resulting meaning is more similar to a
benefactive, as the action itself is performed unto another argument, but for the benefit of the
agent.

‘I will go to my father and [then] say to him:…’
In (68b) for example, the reading of ‘to order’ is dependent on the presence of the reflexive, as
the verb hikæ- ‘say’ by itself does not imply the power dynamic required for the correct reading.
(68b) remains transitive, and the undergoer of the ‘ordering’ action is a different referent from
the man that orders. However, the reflexive does not occur very often in transitive sentences,
and it remains unclear whether this benefactive reading is inherent to the marker, or based on
context.
The plural undergoer marker, -ko PLU, expresses that there are multiple undergoers to the
action. This can mean that the action takes place unto a (large) group of undergoers as a whole
(69a), or that the action takes place unto each of the undergoers separately (69b). In some
specific constructions, it is also possible to have a singular undergoer in combination with the
marker, which indicates that the action iteratively affects the singular undergoer (69c).

is the people of Sere, rather than the village itself.

the speaker’s location, and from the locational clitics since these indicate locations rather than
direction.25 As with the connective marker, the directional meaning can be both more literal

see-E-PST-AU4.2 The Verb complex
Verbs in Sentani are by far the most morphologically complex word class. Besides being
marked for subject and object, they can also be marked for tense-aspect and mood, as well as
several other inflectional categories. These inflectional categories do not always have a
functional overlap and are thus determined by their shared formal property, which is their
position relative to the verb root, i.e. the ‘slot’ they take. Because of the amount of possible
marking, as well as the frequent occurrence of several verb roots together, I refer to an inflected
verb root or roots as the ‘verb complex’ rather than just verb. The verb roots are most frequently
mono- or disyllabic, although trisyllabic verb roots also occur occasionally. If there are multiple
roots in the verb complex, a number of disyllabic roots can also be shortened, e.g. moko- ‘to
do, make’ can be shortened to mo- or ko- depending on the phonological context. However,
this shortening seems to be verb-specific and does not occur in the majority of verb roots. While
some verbs occur predominantly in either intransitive or transitive constructions, the valency
of verb roots is not lexically determined. That is to say, while the verb nəkə- ‘to sit’ can and
does often occur without an object, a location can morphologically be marked as the object on49the verb. Thus, the valency of a verb is determined by the argument marking and, more often,
the context.
The affixes on the verb are primarily suffixes, with the exception of the PRE category of verbal
markers and the habitual, which consist of prefixes and circumfixes. All morphology on the
verb is dependent on the construction and context and there is no marking that is obligatory on
each verb. However, completely unmarked verb forms cannot occur. For example, while it is
possible to leave out subject and object marking when the referents are clear from the context
(58a), the imperative construction has a subject suffix directly attached to the verb root (58b;
see section 4.2.5). Note that in (58a), while there is no object marking on the verb, the indirect
object (the addressee) is disambiguated with a locational clitic.

It is possible to distinguish a verb root from the rest of the morphology, and thus verb roots can
be given in isolation, but are marked with a hyphen afterwards to indicate the root status, e.g.
ələ- ‘say’.
In this section I will first review the types of formal verbal affixation from most basic to most
complex, and then discuss each formal category individually, in order from position closest to
furthest from the verb root: The PRE category and the habitual (section 4.2.1), SFX1 (section
4.2.2, tense-aspect (section 4.2.3), and mood (section 4.2.5).
The affixes in some of the verbal template slots, i.e. the formal property of their position
relative to the verb and mutual exclusivity, form a form-function paradigm, meaning that they
overlap in both formal and functional properties. These categories are thus named according to
their functional category, e.g. person-number marking and mood. However, there are two slots
in which the affixes occupy the same slot, but are functionally diverse. Because it would be
inaccurate to discuss the individual markers as separate categories due to their formal overlap,
but also inaccurate to assign a single term to these functionally diverse markers, I have called
these categories PRE and SFX1 after their formal morphosyntactic property: their relative
position to the verb root.
The most basic verb complex consists only of a verb root, tense-aspect, and mood:
verb root -tense -mood
Figure 3 Basic verbal configurationIt occurs in the most basic sentences that describe simple events where the syntactic roles of
the arguments can easily be garnered from the context (59). Since the present tense is unmarked
(see section 4.2.3), this configuration only features a single morphological marker on the verb
root in the present tense, as in (59b).

"1.2 Current linguistic situation near Lake Sentani
Sentani as a whole is not immediately endangered: 30,000 people (Eberhard, Simons, and
Fennig 2021)of all ages speak and write it in addition to Papuan Malay (Anderbeck 2015;
George Saad, pers. comm.), in addition to Sentani-language schooling being available for at
least grades 1-3. Furthermore, there are some language revitalization efforts by local language
centers (e.g. Jubi, Portal Berita Tanah Papua No.1 2016). However, the number of speakers
is disproportionally spread over the dialects: The vast majority of Sentani speakers are from
the Central dialect area, and the speaker I worked with states that virtually nobody still actively
speaks the Eastern dialect, likely caused by its proximity to Jayapura and a number of
unfortunate early deaths that caused a disruption in the linguistic transmission in Asei. Since it
is impossible to gauge the actual language profile of the people in eastern Lake Sentani without
carrying out a sociolinguistic survey, some secondary assessments must be made stemming
from the speaker. There are two major clues to the likely decline of Sentani language usage:
first, the fact that the speaker only spoke Papua Malay with relatives on the phone, and second
that he states that he has not spoken Sentani since the death of his sister, who is claimed to have
had much expertise in the language. Several exploratory works have been published on both
the Eastern dialect (Cowan 1952a; 1952b; 1965) and especially the Central dialect (D. Hartzler
1976; M. Hartzler 1976; 1986; 1983; Mehuwe, Hartzler, and Hartzler 1993), there is very little
information available about the Western dialect, with no works published and not enough data
available to make an accurate dialectal comparison. Therefore, virtually all dialectal
comparison in this sketch grammar is between the Eastern and Central dialects.",[9]
"Figure 2 The Sentanic language familyAll languages in the family are spoken around the Cyclops mountain range at the north-eastern
coast of Papua province, Indonesia, with Sentani being spoken the furthest from the coast.
Sentani itself is divided into three dialects: Western, Middle, and Eastern Sentani. The three
dialects are quite similar and mutually intelligible, but have some differences in term of their
phonology (M. Hartzler 1976). Additionally, there seems to be an acute awareness of the
differences between the dialects, which is sometimes a minor point of contention. For example,
the speaker I worked with often mentioned that speakers of Central Sentani purposely change
their language every few years because they want to differentiate from the other dialects. This

of which in Hollandia [Jayapura] from 1942-44 (Hughes et al. 2021).

Some sources (e.g. Eberhard, Simons, and Fennig 2020) call this family ‘Sentani’. In this grammar, however,
‘Sentanic’ and ‘Nuclear Sentanic’ will be used following Glottolog (Hammarström, Forkel, and Haspelmath 2021)
in order to avoid confusion with the language proper.",[8]

grammar), it is impossible to see whether tail-head linkage is conventionalized or
grammaticalized in any way, but there seems to be a preference for linkage when the last verb
of the first clause is a motion verb, specifically ə- ‘to go’. The position of the repeated verb in
clause-initial position in addition to one or more other verbs in regular position do indicate that
these are instances of clause linkage, rather than coincidental use of the same verb root twice.","[74, 75]"

3.1 Nouns
Nouns function typically as the heads of NPs and as the arguments in a clause. They are
separated grammatically from other word classes because they can have and/or be possessors,
they have a fixed referent, and they cannot take any suffixes. In fact, the only morphology
nouns can take is infrequent possessive prefixes, and the locational clitics (see section 3.3.1),
which can in turn attach to more word classes than just nouns. The majority of underived nouns
in Sentani are disyllabic. Monosyllabic and trisyllabic nouns do occur with regularly, but no
bare noun exceeds this length. Based on the possible morphology as well as syntactic and
semantic restrictions, several classes can be distinguished. These classes are: Common nouns
(section 3.1.1), mass nouns (section 3.1.2), proper nouns (section 3.1.3), kinship terms (section
3.1.4), and temporal/locational nouns and demonstratives (section 3.1.5).
Note that some nouns are (almost) homophonous with verb roots. However, there seem to be
no synchronic processes of deriving nouns from verbs (or vice versa), and it does not
necessarily mean that they are semantically related, although this is possible (24ab). In practice,
however, verb roots appear rarely without verb-specific morphology,17 meaning that
ambiguous cases are virtually impossible. Lastly, there is a small number of nouns that were
historically derived from verbs, such as akojkoj ‘traditional dancing’ from akoj- ‘tell a
traditional story’.18

Sentani common nouns are the most ‘basic’ word class in that they are least restricted. They
can function as syntactic subject and object, be modified with adjectives, demonstratives,
numerals, and locational clitics, and, with the exception of one (see below), they are optionally
possessed. Unsurprisingly, common nouns are found in almost all semantic domains and vary
phonologically. It also seems to be the only word class that incorporates loanwords (see e.g.
potol in Table 18).

verb root is always reduplicated.
18
It is possible that this verb was in turn derived from a ‘word’ and (mo)ko- ‘do’.","[30, 31, 32]"
"2.4 Orthographical conventions
Generally, the graphemes in the Sentani orthography used in this grammar sketch are based on
the Indonesian alphabet (i.e. the Latin alphabet with the sound correspondences used in
Indonesian orthography), supplemented by a few additional graphemes and digraphs where
there is none available. One exception to this is the grapheme for /j/, which corresponds to <y>
in the Indonesian alphabet, but for this sketch grammar, <j> is used instead, which corresponds
to [ɟ] in the Indonesian alphabet. The main reason for this is that the allophone of [ɟ] occurs
only very infrequently in a specific context (preceded by /i/), in which it is written with <dj> if
the surrounding graphemes do not provide enough context for the correct pronunciations, e.g.,
in odjo ‘chicken’. Additionally, when reading texts that used Cowan’s (1965) orthography, it
was never misinterpreted by the speaker. Therefore, in order to cover both allophones as well
as emphasize its status as a consonant rather than a vowel, <j> was chosen as the corresponding
grapheme.
A similar exception is /n/ realized as [ɲ]. Since the preceding consonant, /j/, gives enough clue
for the pronunciation, it is unnecessary to use the digraph <nj>, e.g., rowkajnəle ‘they have
found something’ instead of *<rowkajnjəle>. While this is an aesthetic choice, it does not
impact readability since there is no alternative realization for /n/ in this context.
If a phoneme is in a position where free variation is possible, e.g., phrase-initial /t/ realized as
[t~d~r] or /k/ in an unrestricted position (see section 2.1.1 above) realized as [k~k͡x~x], the
underlying phoneme is written, i.e., <t> and <k>, respectively. If, however, the condition
allows only one allophone, e.g., /t/ after a nasal which may only be [d], the grapheme
corresponding to this allophone is used. An exception to this is where the phonological
condition is across word boundaries, e.g., with word-final nasals, in which case the underlying
phoneme is used.
The accent aigu (´) is used to indicate stress on a word where it is not regularly assigned as
described in section 2.3 above.
Lastly, personal names are distinguished from their non-name counterparts by capitalization of
each element, e.g. Kələw Nikíban ‘PN’ versus kələw nikíban ‘Morningstar’ (lit. ‘spotless
glimmer’), and exocentric or lexically opaque compounds are marked with a hyphen (-).
The orthographical choices were based on two considerations. Firstly, and mainly, it strives to
write words as consistently as possible while allowing for the variant pronunciations. Secondly,
it is based on the orthography used by the speaker, although admittedly somewhat loosely. As
said, its main design function was to keep spelling as consistent and concise as possible, thus
it is not necessarily designed for everyday use, especially since it contains some graphemes
that are not familiar to most non-linguistics, such as <æ> and <ə>.",[30]
"41The basic hierarchy of unexpected agents is 1,2 > third person pronoun > animate referent >
inanimate referent; Table 23 gives a schematic overview of the different conditions in which
object disambiguation is required, given that the context does not provide this.

its ‘new’ function is a clear indication that =re TWDS has developed characteristics of a case
marker, and it is possible that it will further develop as such.
Lastly, the locational enclitics clearly share a common origin due to their formal overlap, but
the word class they originate from is difficult to establish. The main two contenders for origins
are verbs and postpositions. Firstly, there are several motion verbs and we have seen that the
(normally) disyllabic verb roots can be shortened to a single syllable in the correct
circumstances. Additionally, there are some synchronic verb forms that are formally and
functionally related to the locationals, e.g. ərə ‘walk’ and =rə TO, and nəkə ‘sit’ and =nə IN.
However, verb roots, especially shortened ones, cannot occur in their base form synchronically,
which means that the language must have undergone a major typological change from the
supposed moment that these verb roots were integrated into nominal morphology, which does
not necessarily shine through from other elements of the verbal morphology.22 Additionally,
we see that monosyllabic shortenings of verb roots have a tendency to develop into verbal
rather than nominal morphology (see section 4.2.2). Instead, I believe they may have stemmed
from earlier postpositions. The main evidence for this is that there are no postpositions in the
language, the only possible instance being əj ‘inside’ (44a). As can be seen there, əj is marked
with the locational clitic =nə IN, and is thus most likely a locational noun, similar to puma ‘top’
(44b). Note that even this category is relatively very small, as the function normally occupied
by locational nouns and/or adpositions is instead carried out mainly by the locational clitics.

"55Lastly, there is a handful of instances where the person-number marker appears before SFX1 in
a non-imperative-optative construction. This may be connected with the affectedness markers,
but its origin and purpose currently remain unknown.
The first of SFX1’s subcategories I am discussing here is Affectedness. The markers in this
category express degree of affectedness of the undergoer, affected undergoer -bo AU (66) and
reflexive -nu REFL (66b), or the number of undergoers, connective -hi CONN (66c), or can
express either (or both), depending on the context, plural undergoer -ko PLU (66d).

The affected undergoer marker -bo AU emphasizes the affectedness of the undergoer. In the
case of intransitive constructions, the undergoer is the subject, and in the case of transitive
constructions it is the object. There are no instances of a ditransitive construction with this
marker. Thus, while (67a) means generally cutting into something, (67b) means to fully cut
through something, emphasizing the affectedness of the object.

For intransitive constructions, it emphasizes the (lack of) agency the subject has over the action,
which can take on several meanings. For example, from the verb root hono- ‘lie down’ you get
honoj ‘lie down!’ and honojbo ‘go to sleep!’, while from nəkə- ‘to sit’ you get nəkəj ‘sit down!’
and nəkəjbo ‘keep sitting (even though you may not want to)!’. Thus, the expression of some
events is dependent on the affected undergoer marker.","[56, 57]"

longer seems productive, or at least not in these specific circumstances.
Although it is perfectly possible for a CV.V(C) sequence to occur within a word, and these do
occur regularly, e.g. [a.bu.ˈa.xo] abuako ‘traditional doctor/close relative’, the data contains no
instances of a V.V(C) sequence within a word. Across word boundaries, however, this
sequence is frequent and requires no epenthetic consonant to resolve hiatus (19). Since several
other aspects of Sentani phonological interaction take place across word boundaries, it is
therefore difficult to establish V.V(C) as an impossible sequence within the word; its absence
rather may be due to the dataset.

2.2.1 Closed syllables
There are some words with syllables containing more than a single vowel and a consonant, i.e.
CVC. The vast majority of these are closed syllables with a nasal or a glides in the coda. In
some cases these are the result a set of productive phonological rules, but others are the result
of historical developments. The first is a set of rules in which vowels may be deleted following
a nasal if they are of the same quality as the vowel preceding the nasal, and the second is a
historical rule in which the vowel /ə/ is deleted after a glides, both of which were discussed in
section 2.1.3 above. Since consonant clusters are not allowed in Sentani phonology, it seems
unlikely that either the two nasal phonemes may form a syllable by themselves, or that there
are homorganic nasal + consonant clusters phonemically, and therefore they must be the result
of the aforementioned ruleset.
The first ruleset is a good starting point, showing that a process of vowel elision is productive
in the language, but it does not explain all instances of CVCnasal and do not cover CVCglide
syllables. It is possible to suppose that all forms ending in CVCnasal had the vowel pattern
23required for rule 1., but this would require us to suppose that all the above forms adhered to,
and subsequently lexicalized, the rules that we have seen to be somewhat variable
contemporarily.
The existence of CVCglide and especially CVCnasal as underlying syllable structures in presentday Sentani cannot be argued against. Nonetheless, we can determine with some accuracy the
developmental process, and can thus determine the historical depth of the phonological rules
proposed here: Gregerson and Hartzler (1987, 15) propose with sufficient evidence that protoNuclear-Sentanic13 had the syllable types *V, *CV, and * CVCnasal. This means that, due to the
absence of CVCglide, rule 4. can only have taken place after the split of proto-Nuclear-Sentanic.
Although there is very limited data available about Nafri, Sentani’s closest related language, it
seems to also have CVCglide syllables,14 whereas cognate forms in Tabla do not have CVCglide,
e.g., Tabla tə-, Sentani ərəj ‘to see’ and Tabla datə məwə vs. Sentani məj ‘come’ (Gregerson
and Hartzler 1987, 19). This means that the process that gave rise to CVCglide syllables can be
determined as a feature of proto-Sentani-Nafri. Reversely, Cowan (1952a, 162) gives several
forms for Demta, the language furthest from Sentani within the Sentanic family, which show
several syllable types and word-formations not found in Sentani:

Note that, for the reference tracking use of the demonstrative(s), the clauses can be, but are not
necessarily, adjacent. For example, there are three sentences between (100a) and (100b), which
are all in the same location, but concern the actions of the agent in (100a). The reintroduction
of the referent jo ‘village’ in (100b) thus serves to indicate that the narrative is moving forward,
e.g. a new section is starting, while showing the connection with the previous events.
Tail-head linkage also occurs regularly, although not very frequently. Linkage here means that
the final verb of a clause is repeated at the beginning of the succeeding clause. While the verb
stem remains the same, the inflection can change (101a-b).

<-i> here most likely refers to /-j/ in a non-intervocalic position and thus analyzed as a consonant.
1324However, the historical processes described in the section above also interact with stress in
Sentani, causing some forms that seem to stray from the regular stress assignment pattern
observed.
There is also a small number of lexemes with the syllable structure CnasalCV(Cglide) or
alternatively N.CV(Cglide), namely mbə ‘where’, and mbaj ‘one’ and its derivates (see section
3.3.3). However, the words often surface with an epenthetic vowel, e.g. [əm.ˈbaj]. It is unclear
what the exact origin of these forms is, but it is specific to Eastern Sentani. In Central Sentani
the rules laid out above also apply, but with the additional restriction that it cannot occur in the
first syllable of a prosodic word (M. Hartzler 1976, 79).16 The differences in some of the
cognates are, among other things, based on the deletion of the vowel, cf. CSet. makei (ibid.)
versus ESet. mbə ‘where’, however Central Sentani does have the form mbai and its
derivatives, meaning that it is not a strict distinction between the two dialects. Whether this is
directly connected to the specific vowel deletion rules above is unknown, as they do not seem
to adhere to the required pattern; since these forms are highly infrequent, it can also be
attributed to idiosyncratic and/or ongoing developments.","[25, 26]"
"The name Sentani, although generally used to denote the language and the area, is not an
endonym. Cowan (1965) states that it “…probably originates from the coastal tribes of the
Humboldt [Yos Sudarso] bay.”, but it could also possibly be a loan from Japanese 千谷 sen
tani ‘thousand valleys’, referring to the surrounding Cyclops mountain range (“Festival Danau
6Sentani” 2008).1 There seems to be no historical word for the language or Sentani-speaking
peoples as a whole, but Sentani or həndani ‘Sentani’ are now generally accepted as endonyms.
Lake Sentani itself is referred to as pu jakala ‘clear water’, with some sources giving pu jaka
afǽw ‘clear water language’ as the endonym for the language specifically (e.g. Onde et al.
1979), and individuals are generally connected to the village or house they are from, rather than
the area as a whole. Contemporarily, these village or house names practically function as clan
names and/or surnames and həndani afæw ‘Sentani language’ is used as the name for the
language.
1.1 The Sentanic family and the Sentani dialects
Sentani (ISO 639-3: set ) belongs to the small Sentanic2 language family (Gregerson and
Hartzler 1987, inter alia). Although higher-level classification remains debated (e.g. Wurm,
Voorhoeve, and McElhanon 1975; Ross 2005), the internal organization of the Sentani family
has been established as in Figure 2 since the 1960s (Cowan 1965).","[7, 8]"
"First, in an SVC (95a), the verb roots share an argument structure, and the subject is marked
on both verbs. Second, a verbal compound (95b) consists of two juxtaposed verbs without any
interfering morphology whatsoever, and subsequently they are treated morphologically as a
single verb root in the verb complex. Finally, a Close Event Sequence (95c) differs from a
multi-clausal construction in that there can be no interfering elements between the two verbs.
(95a-c) give examples of the three constructions, and each type of multi-verb construction will
be discussed individually below:

‘His young son took all his belongings and went to live alone.’
In an SVC, the explicit marking of arguments tends to be only on the second verb root, but it
is possible to mark arguments on each individual verb root. This marking does not need to be
identical on both verb roots (see section 4.2). This follows the general optionality of argument
marking across all verbs in Sentani. That being said, SVCs do underlyingly always share the
same argument structure, meaning that, for example, an argument that serves as the subject of
the first verb root cannot be (marked as) the object of the second verb root.
Verbal Compounds, on the other hand are not very frequent, and they seem to be used for
highly specific constructions, such as the slaughtering of pigs (96a). In this case, simply using
the verb root hə- ‘to hit’ would indicate only hitting the pig, non-lethally (96b), whereas the
verb compound indicates the lethality of the action. Thus, the juxtaposition of two verb roots
modifies the semantics of one or even both of them. In this sense, they can in some cases be
seen as a form of exocentric compounds, as the resulting semantics of the compound does not
necessarily strictly follow from each individual verb root. Other verbal compounds are not as
restricted; the compound in (96c-d) can be used as long as the object is animate.

70The morphological status of po- ‘to strike’ is still clearly verbal in (96), but it is possible that
this verb root is developing into an affectedness marker, a process we have seen in other verb
roots as well as the historic origin of some other markers (see section 4.2.2).
The Close Event Sequence indicates a sequence of two events that occur in an immediate
sequence. More specifically, since it is a monoclausal construction, it describes two smaller
actions, which are closely connected sequentially, occurring within one event. It may initially
seem that this is a multi-clausal construction where the second clause consists only of a verb,
there is a crucial difference between the two: A Close Event Sequence can have no interfering
arguments between the two verb complexes, as in (97a). If constituents are placed between two
inflected verbs (97b), the events, while still sequential, do not necessarily follow each other
immediately and/or are spread out over a longer time span. (97b) can thus not be considered a
Close Event Sequence but are two individual clauses. In a Close Event Sequence, both
arguments are independently inflected and can thus feature all regular verbal morphology, but
there is a tendency to have one verb with fewer morphological elements than the other.27

(97a) shows that a combination of a Close Event Sequence and an SVC is also possible, which
is in this case especially interesting since the same verb stem, ə- ‘go’, appears both in the Close
Event Sequence verb and in the SVC, which clearly delineates two separate events, i.e. one of
‘coming’ and one of ‘telling him’. It also shows that, while in an SVC the valency of the mostvalent verb is followed, the roots themselves are not ambivalent, since the verb root ə- ‘go’ by
itself is strictly intransitive. Note that the reflexive marker -nu REFL in this example is a verbspecific construction to get ‘to order’ from hikæ- ‘to say’. (98) also shows that the first verb
complex in the Close Event Sequence can be an SVC as well. In this example, the second verb
complex, with the verb root ə- ‘go’, expresses the continuing, or perhaps repetitive, manner of
the first event. While Close Event Sequences seem to require at least one of the verb complexes27A structural study of the specific number and type of different markers on the verb roots could perhaps shed
light on the syntactic hierarchy of both the verb root order and the markers themselves; but further data is necessary
for this to be possible.","[70, 71, 72]"
"Note that, since phonological rules function across word boundaries, although irregularly and
only in fast speech, the variation can also be seen at the onset of the first syllable. Table 10
gives examples of these variations and their position in the word, although not all positions are
covered in the data. For the velar plosive, /k/, the fricative variant appears both voiced and
unvoiced, [x~ɣ], although the latter variant is extremely infrequent. Note that these examples
only showcase the semi-free variation, not the specific conditions which determine the
appearance of one particular allophone.

syllable ends in a nasal, the plosive is always voiced. For /t/ and /p/, these variants are already
present in the alternation in (5), but for /k/ the additional variant /g/ appears (5). Additionally,
the nasal assimilates to the same position as the plosive.

after a nasal may be deleted if it is of the same quality as the previous vowel or no previous
vowel is available, and, subsequently, the nasal assimilating in location to the consonant it is
now next to. For example, the historical formation of (5) is as follows: *mænækə > /mænkə/ >
[ˈmæŋ.gə]. This process is further detailed in section 2.2.1.
In some words, in isolation, a glottal stop infrequently appears at the end, e.g. [pe]~[peʔ] ‘two’.
Hartzler (1976, 73) analyzes this as an allomorph of /k/, but since it appears so infrequently
and I could not find any instances in which its presence or absence had any semantic impact.
Additionally. it contradicts the possible syllable types (see section 2.2). Therefore, I do not
include it in the allophone set of /k/.
Since there are many phonetic fricatives that arise from phonological operations, it is important
to distinguish the phonemic position of the two underlying fricatives, /f/ and /ɦ/.
/f/ may initially seem like a candidate for a lenited form of the stop /p/, but it appears without
variation in contexts that make this impossible, as well as being less restricted by other
phonological rules that apply to (lenited) stops such as assimilation. (6) and (6) show /f/
appearing word-initially and word-medially, respectively, without (possible) variation.
Additionally, (6c) shows /f/ following a nasal, where the nasal is homorganic, but /f/ remains
unvoiced. Since the stops are always voiced when following a nasal, this is evidence for /f/ as
a separate phoneme.

of a historical phonological change from the latter: /s/ changed into /ɦ/ in every environment
except when following a nasal, in which case it remains /s/. This change is easy to detect since
it is restricted to the Eastern Dialect and in part to the Central Dialect; Cowan (1965) notes that
in the Western dialect [s] appears in each case of [ɦ] in Eastern Sentani, meaning that */s/ must
have been the phoneme historically. This is easily seen in the name for one of the islands in
Lake Sentani: WSet. Asej and ESet. Ohəj, and this analysis is included in Gregerson and
Hartzler’s (1987) reconstruction of proto-Tabla-Sentani phonology. It is at this point difficult
to pinpoint when exactly this change took place, but since it is present in the Eastern and Central
Dialect, although not in all cases in the latter, but not in the Western Dialect, it must be
relatively recently, i.e. after the split of Sentani-Nafri, and after Dialects started to diverge.
16As mentioned above, the nasals, /n/ and /m/, are prone to allophony based on the surrounding
consonants. Most variation occurs word-finally: both nasals in word-final position freely vary
when the word is uttered in isolation, e.g. /n/ can word-finally be realized as [n~ŋ], and /m/ as
[m~n~ŋ], but there are certain environments in which this variation is restricted, although this
is a tendency rather than a strict phonological rule:
/m/ most frequently appears as [m] word-finally (7a), but if the following word starts with a
vowel (7b) or a nasal (7c), it appears as [ŋ]. If the following word starts with /t/, /m/ is realized
as [n] (7d).

‘A big dog came to me’/n/ may appear as [n~ŋ] word-finally. However, in isolation, the variant [ŋ] is by far the most

(see section 2.2.1 below), i.e. /nanəmənnə/ > [na.ˈnə.mən], but not *[na.ˈnə.məŋ~m].
Gregerson and Hartzler (1987, 14–15) propose that word-final nasals are a reflex of the ProtoTabla-Sentani general final nasal *-N, and state that, in Central Sentani, it is always realized
as [m] in isolation. However, in my data for Eastern Sentani there are certain words that never
appear with a final [m] (8a-b), whether in isolation or not, and even influence the realization
of other word-final nasals (8c). Therefore, although this may historically have been the case,
the appearance of word-final nasals cannot be subsumed under a single phoneme in presentday (Eastern) Sentani, as proposed by Gregerson and Hartzler (ibid.).

In some words where /t/ and /l/ appear intervocalically in sequence, metathesis takes place
(12a), with an additional optional cooccurrence of /e/ as [ə]. The likely reason for this is to
disambiguate from another verb form (12b), which would look identical had metathesis not
taken place. In my data, this combination of consonants is the only instance of metathesis, and
it is thus not likely that this is a regular, structural operation.

important role in Sentani phonology. They occur both in many lexemes and are very prominent
in the pronominal affixation paradigms, and are the only consonants besides nasals allowed to
appear in the syllable coda. Contrary to the nasals, however, they are not as heavily influenced
by their phonological environment and generally appear as [j] and [w]. As noted above, when
a nasal follows /j/, it assimilates to [ɲ]. However, optionally /j/ may subsequently be elided as
well (13a). The second variant of /j/ is [ɟ], which appears when following /i/ or /j/, and is thus
a dissimilation. Note that for the latter, the rule occurs across word boundaries (13b).

b. [o.ˈɦəj ɟo]
ohəj jo ‘Asei village’18In (13a), the underlying form is /a-j-nu/ ‘take-2.SBJ-REFL’, where the juxtaposition of the
second person subject suffix -j and the nasal of the reflexive suffix -nu lead to the interaction
resulting in [jɲ]~[ɲ].
There is one case (14) which features [ɟ] but does not seem to be in the correct environment to
warrant this. However, Hartzler (1976, 74) gives this word as CSet. [oi.ɟo] /oijo/, meaning that
the lack of /i/ may be due further phonological developments in Eastern Sentani. As mentioned
for /j/ preceding /l/ above, the deletion of /i/ or /j/ preceding a consonant occurs in other
conditions as well. Additionally, some verb stems having an optional but not frequent /j/ in the
verb stem, e.g. ərə(j)- ‘to see’. All of this shows that the deletion is an ongoing phonological
process and is still productive.
(14) [ˈo.ɟo] odjo ‘chicken’
In the data, /w/ does not show any variation whatsoever, but it could be expected that it may
appear as [u] due to resyllabification. This process is, however, rather rare contemporarily in
Sentani and generally only occurs on the verb due to affixation creating word structures
incongruent with word-formation rules. In most cases the incongruency is solved by removing
a vowel and/or the merging of two affixes.
Although vowels themselves do not seem to influence their direct surroundings with the
exception of /i/ preceding /j/, the interaction of syllables in verbal affixes results in certain
vowels appearing above others. However, this is usually not governed by vowel quality, but
rather by the order of the affixes: For example, if the order is /-kə-le/ PST-IND, the resulting
surface form is [ke], but if the order is /-kə-a-le/ PST-1SG.SBJ-IND the form is [kale]. This occurs
most frequently on the affixes, but it is not restricted to this; the final vowel of a verb stem also
undergoes this assimilation e.g. /ələ-a-le/ speak-1SG.SBJ-IND ‘I speak’ surfaces as [ə.ˈla.le].
Besides this, there is optional vowel harmony, where any vowel may harmonize with one of its
surrounding vowels. While it is optional in all cases, it occurs more frequently in fast speech
or a sentence context than in isolation, and is much more frequent in the verbal complex than
other words. Of the vowels, /ə/ is by far the most susceptible to the vowel harmony, assimilating
by far the most often to its surrounding vowels. Conversely, other vowels rarely assimilate to
[ə].
Additionally, there is a set of interacting phonological rules where, among other things, vowels
are deleted. These rules also interact with the syllable structure, which will be further discussed
in section 2.2.1. Therefore, based on the proposal by Hartzler for Central Sentani (1976, 77–
79), I propose the following ruleset for Eastern Sentani:
1. A vowel may be deleted if the consonant in the onset of the syllable is a nasal, and the
preceding vowel is of the same vowel quality.
2. If a nasal and a voiceless stop or /l/ appear next to each other, the nasal assimilates to
the homorganic position and the stop becomes voiced or /l/ becomes the voiced stop
[d].
3. In fast speech a stop may optionally assimilate fully to the preceding nasal.","[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"38The possessive prefixes can be attached to a limited number of nouns in order to indicate
otherwise unemphasized possession. Additionally, the first person plural can be used for an
underspecified possessor or, often, as a polite alternative to the first person singular possessor.
This occurs both with independent possessive pronouns (38a) and prefixed possession (39).
The possessive prefixes are further discussed in section 3.3.4.

The noun phrase consists minimally of a lexical noun or pronoun, which can be conjoined with
another noun or pronoun (40a), compounded (40b; this acts as a noun syntactically), or
modified with demonstratives (40c), numerals (40c), quantifiers (40d)20 adjectives (40e), and,
if the noun phrase is the object, locational clitics that attach to the right edge of the noun phrase
(40e). The noun phrase itself is left-headed, meaning that the main noun is at the left-most edge
of the phrase, and all modification, with the exception of the demonstratives, is placed after it.
Multiple adjectives can modify the noun (or compound), the resulting meaning of which is
dependent on the semantics of the nouns and the adjectives (40f). Within the modifiers to the
noun, the ordering is as follows: modifying noun, adjective(s), numeral, and
postposition/demonstrative.

"The nasals, /m/ and /n/, although relatively frequent, are extremely susceptible to their
phonological environment, especially consonants. Although there is a number of conditions in
which the underlying form of the nasal is obscured, a single nasal phoneme, */N/, cannot be
presupposed for present-day Sentani, since both [m] and [n] appear in unrestricted, lexically
determined, conditions, such as word-initially or intervocalically. The variation is further
detailed in section 2.1.3.
Because of its relatively low frequency, a minimal pair could only be found for word-initial /f/,
with a near-minimal pair for word-medial position:12Phonetic form

‘all together’Here, /l/ assimilates to [d], as described above, following rule 2, making the environment
suitable for rule 3. to take place; the final syllable can become [nə]. This in turn creates the
appropriate conditions for rule 1. to take place, leading to the final form in which the final /ə/
is deleted. The fact that all three forms are possible and have been found in the data shows that
although the rules require specific environments to take place, they are still optional. However,
there are several words where the process has been lexicalized, such as kambu ‘root’, which I
analyze as historically /kanapu/ > *kanpu > [ˈkam.bu] ‘root’. This shows that these rules have
been productive for a long time, especially since the syllable *CVCnasal has been postulated for
proto-Tabla-Sentani (Gregerson and Hartzler 1987; further discussed below).
Besides contemporary variation and lexicalization on non-verbs, affixation on the verb shows
that at least rule 1. and 2. are still fully productive without variation in some domains:

‘I want to say something to
him.’In (16) the combination of the plural undergoer, third person object, and indicative mood
suffixes, -ko, -no and -le respectively, creates an environment where both rules 1. and 2. can
apply. To clarify, the third person object suffix contains a nasal, and the plural undergoer and
third person object suffixes both have the same vowel, /o/. This means that the combination of
the two, /-ko-no/ fulfills the conditions for rule 1. to apply, resulting in [kon]. Because of this,
the /l/ of the indicative suffix now directly follows the nasal, */ko-n-le/, which means rule 2.
can take place, resulting in the final form [konde]. Thus, the development of the underlying
form to the surface form for (16) is as follows: /ələwkonole/ > */ələwkonle/ > [ə.ləw.ˈkon.de].
(17) as well as a number of underived forms such as mana ‘today’ and ana ‘mother’, however,
show that these rules are not without exception:

In the case of the underived form it is most likely the idiosyncratic application of the ruleset,
but for (17) it may also stem from the fact that the deleted vowel would result in the entire
morpheme no longer being detectable, which would thus influence the semantics.
Finally, there is a historical rule in which word-final /ə/ is deleted:
4. Historically, word-final /ə/ is deleted if it follows a nasal consonant or a glide.","[20, 21]"

Sentani people, Dohajo, rides a giant snake from near Vanimo (PNG) to Lake Sentani, first
landing on Asei island on the eastern side of the lake. From here the group gradually split up
into several subgroups with their own ondofolo ‘chief’, but the Asei ondofolo retains a certain
higher status based on seniority (Kaigere and Stanley 2011, 407).3 The Asei group, speaking
Eastern Sentani, thus also see themselves as stewards of the language, and any deviation from
their dialect is seen as an effort from the other dialects to differentiate themselves, and in some
cases undermine their linguistic authority.","[8, 9]"

"There are two instances in which the SFX1 does not attach directly to the verb root: Firstly, in
the imperative-optative construction (see section 4.2.5) the subject marker is always placed
directly after the verb root, and SFX1 thus follows this. Secondly, epenthetic -w E appears
directly after one or more of the verb roots when SFX1 is present in a sentence with a singular
subject (65). The function of the epenthetic seems to be solely to indicate the above, and is not
based on phonology.

Additionally, there seems to be some variability in its occurrence: While it appears almost
without exception on the first root if there are multiple roots present in the verb complex, this
is not always the case if there is only one verb root. This seems to either be free variation or
the result of phonological reduction due to fast speech, but specific conditions may be found
in the future.",[56]
"5.2 Multi-verb constructions
There are three multi-verb constructions in Sentani: Serial Verb Constructions, Verb
compounds, and what I am calling Close Event Sequences.
Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs), where two (or more) verbs share one argument structure
and inflection and describe a single event (e.g. Bisang 2009), are extremely common in Sentani.
So common, in fact, that it is generally easier to refer to the verb complex rather than simply
the ‘verb’. Additionally, there are verb compounds, in which the presence of an additional verb
modifies the action of another verb rather than the event as a whole. Lastly there are Close
Event Sequences, which share at least one argument but have separate argument structure and
denote separate events. Table 33 shows the differentiating factors of the three constructions.

"The Demta forms, although in most cases clear cognates to the Sentani forms, indicate that the
phonological developments proposed above cannot be applied to proto-Sentanic, at least
initially. The fact that most Sentani cognates either have the same amount or fewer syllables
may actually point to a process of simplification in proto-Nuclear-Sentanic, but this would
require further research.
Thus, while all cases of CVCglide syllables and many CVCnasal syllables are due to historical
resyllabification caused by vowel deletion, and these syllable types must thus be accepted as
underlying, there are also productive phonological rules that create this resyllabification and
these syllable types contemporarily. Due to the relatively little available historical data it is at
this time not a useful endeavor to try to fully disambiguate which instances of (word-final)
CVCnasal are historical, lexicalized forms and which are due to the productive ruleset.",[25]

bigAs stated in section 3.1 above, two nouns in a noun phrase can either be an endocentric
compound (e.g. moni-maj ‘famine’), or an exocentric compound (40e). Also note that noun
phrases with more than one noun, can function as verbless existential clauses within the correct
context (see section 4.3).
3.3.1 Nominal morphology
As mentioned above, one of the distinguishing factors of nouns and noun phrases is that there
is minimal morphology on the noun phrase. The only two morphological operations are
possessive prefixing on lexical nouns, restricted to a certain set of nouns (see section 3.3.4
below), and the locational enclitics that attach to the noun phrase as a whole:

Lastly, the habitual circumfix j- -jə attaches to the first suffix that follows the verb root. The
circumfix attaches to this suffix regardless of its category, with the exception of the modal
suffixes, which are always at the end of a verbal complex. Due to its infrequency, there are
very few instances of the habitual in my data, but Elenbaas (1999, 56) shows that the circumfix
can attach to person-number suffixes (64b), and Cowan (1965, 23) shows that the circumfix
will simply be placed after the root with nothing between the two elements if the only other
affixation on the verb is modal (64c).

4.2.2 SFX1
The SFX1 category of verbal affixes is, as mentioned above, named after the formal properties
the members of this category share: they are placed directly after the verb root. The category
consists of six affixes, which can be grouped into two functional categories: Affectedness and
Directionality, shown in Table 27. The functions of each subcategory are discussed
individually below.","[54, 55]"
"20Although it seems that the rule is no longer fully productive, owing to the fact that there are
many words ending in a nasal + /ə/, Cowan (1965, 10) noted that multisyllabic verb roots tend
to drop word-final /ə/ when it is preceded by a glide or nasal, regardless of vowel quality of the
preceding vowel. He, however, restricts this rule to verbal roots only. This restriction is most
likely due to that the variation can best be observed in variable contexts, i.e., morphology,
which is much less extensive and common on non-verbs. I, however, propose that this process
took place on all words with a word-final glide-/ə/ combination historically, and that the
variable application on verbs is a vestige of this. The main evidence for this is that there are
virtually no instances of this word-final glide-/ə/ combination in the data, whereas there are
many examples of a combination of a glide and different vowels. These four phonological rules
are also important in the (historical) formation of closed syllables, discussed in section 2.2.1.
