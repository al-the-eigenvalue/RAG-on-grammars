verb and the other negates the auxiliary, resulting in a simple negation, not thereversal of one negation. In the second type, a fronted negative topic clause is negated
in the focus, rendering the assertion of the whole sentence strongly affirmative.",[692]
"Summary of Chapter 14In this chapter different types of negative constructions have beeninvestigated, all of which contain the negative particle maiv or its shortened form mv.
Areas covered are (i) the simple negation, (ii) the modification of negation inauxiliaries and emphatic negation, (iii) the negation of copular verbs, (iv) the double
negation both with the negative proposition and the affirmative proposition, (v) thescope of negation in SVCs and coverb constructions, and (vi) the negative imperative,

"3.3.4.1 Keeping the tones in statementUnlike in English, the intonation of Iu Mien sentence in affirmative statementends with the same tone of the final word without pitch falling down. For example,
the final word of a sentence Ninh mingh hei [3SG go market] ‘He is going to the market’has the high level tone (Tone 1 /˦/), thus the intonation contour of the sentence keeps
Tone 1 (at 138.7Hz in this particular speaker) as shown in Figure 36:(ium_1967_04_Permaton_HCox_y_YSC-WI-Tape3-p6;00.08.55-6)Figure 36.

Note that in Figure 37 Yie maiv mingh hei [1SGNEG go market] ‘I am not going to the market’ has the same horizontal intonation onthe last word, which is Tone 1 /˦/ (143Hz in this particular speaker).",[219]

NEGATION
IntroductionNegation is marked by the particle maiv /mai˦˥˧/ ‘not’, placed immediatelybefore verbs, adjectival verbs, and auxiliary verbs. In a rapid and colloquial speech,the particle is often contracted to a syllabic nasal mv /m̩ ˦˥˧/. The particle’s phoneticsimilarity with the negative particles in other languages might have been due to theareal contacts as can be seen in Thai mâi (ไม่) and Chinese méi (没), one of two negative
particles, the other being bù (不)(Wiedenhof 1994:93-124).","[683, 684]"
"12.5.4 Sentence-final Aspectual Particles
12.5.4.1 nyei ‘ASSERTIVE, AFFIRMATIVE’Court (1986:218, 219, passim) glosses nyei as “assertive particle” to indicatethe state of affair, condition, and situation. As it is frequently, but not exclusively,
used in affirmative statement, it may be safe to name it ‘affirmative stative aspectual
particle’.",[670]
"Negation in Iu Mien is marked by the negative particle maiv / mai˦˥˧/or its contraction
form (i.e. syllabic nasal) mv /m̩ ˦˥˧/ ‘not’ placed immediately before the verbals (i.e.verbs, copular verbs, modal verbs, and adjectival verbs). An example is ninh maiv daaih620[3sg neg come] ‘he doesn’t come’. More details including negation of imperative,
modals and double negation will be discussed in Chapter 13.","[656, 657]"

NEGIn the above two examples, the surface structure of having three verbal forms(e.g. haih ‘to be able’, mingh ‘to go’, taux ‘to reach’) while having only two occurrencesof the negative particle may need an explanation. In both (879) and (880-2), the
auxiliary verb phrase haih gorngv ‘to be able to talk/speak’ as a unit is negated by thefirst negative particle mv, and the resultative verbs taux ‘to reach’ and zuqc ‘to TOUCH’
are negated by the second negative particle mv. The pattern, therefore, is that theauxiliary verb phrase comprising two verbal forms occurs with only one negative657particle rather than each of them being negated separately.","[693, 694]"
"This chapter addresses (i) the simple negation (§13.3), (ii) the modification ofnegation in auxiliaries and emphatic negation (§13.4), (iii) the negation of copular

straightforward prohibition and polite prohibition.",[684]
"13.6.1 Negation of Main Verb Plus Negation of Auxiliary =
NegativeThe first type of double negation is still a negation. The first negative particlenegates an auxiliary verb and the second the main verb as in (878). Morphologically,
both full form maiv and contracted form mv can occur in one sentence in three ways:
(i) maiv VAUX, maiv VMAIN; (ii) maiv VAUX, mv VMAIN; (iii) mv VAUX, mv VMAIN.",[692]

different functions, they are repeated here. The particle nyei can be used as:Purnell (2012:365) analyses as “a bound form which combines with the following verb to form a
noun, often an abstract noun. [Usage is that] in positive sentences in English, this might be
154translated with a suffix such as –ability, -ness, or –ful. In negative sentences in English, this

In this phrase, the negative particle mv never occurs in the full form maiv.",[701]
"As has been established that the Iu Mien adjectivals are verbs (as opposed toChinese-loan adjectives) in §7.2.1 and §7.2.2, these tests are also applicable to
identify adjectival verbs. Verbs (and adjectival verbs) can 1) immediately bepreceded by the negative particle maiv (or mv), 2) take aspectual verbs and
particles, and 3) modify a head noun in the construction [NHDV] to form a
noun phrase. Let us examine these tests:
Negation test, i.e., [maiv + V]Aspectual marking tests, i.e., (i) [V + aspectual verb], (ii) [V + nyei]
[ASSERTIVE/STATIVE]Head Noun-modifying test, i.e., [NHDV]NP57511.1.1.1 Negation test
According to Matisoff (1982:193) and Court (1986), with regard to Lahu andIu Mien respectively, verbs are identified by the fact that they can directly follow thenegative particle maiv /mai˦˥˧/ ‘not’ or its contract form mv /m˦˥˧/ are verbs. Court
(1986:213) defines Iu Mien verbs “as that form-class which can occur in the syntacticenvironment immediately following the negative particle”. Not only verbs, in the caseof Iu Mien in our analysis, but also adjectival verbs (excluding the Chinese-loan
adjectives) and auxiliary verbs are also identified by this test. Thus, the following test:
Negation test: Maiv X; if passed, X is a verb or an adjectival verb or an auxiliaryverb; if failed, X is a noun or other kinds of particle.","[611, 612]"
"789Thus, the structure of the co-occurrence of the sentence final groundingelements, or the ordering of double SFPs, can be summarised as follows:
Co-occurrence of grounding elements●Sentence = Clause ± aspectual marking particle ±modal particlequestion particleThere are some other SFPs. The following list only offers items withoutexamples:saa /saː˦/ ‘indicates the speaker’s irritation or indignation’ (Purnell 2012:649)lorqv /lɔʔ˥/ ‘a particle throwing back onto the speaker whatever positive or
negative comments were made about one’s character or ability’ (ibid.
390)weqv or wev /weʔ˥/ or /we˦˥/ ‘indicates a speaker’s emphatic shifting of
responsibility for a remark or assumption back to the previous speaker’
(ibid. 717)Summary of Chapter 19An isolated word or an abstract sentence does not communicate. It needs to begrounded in the interlocutory scene. To achieve this SFPs are lavishly used. As the
grounding elements, SFPs function as both aspectual markers and modal markers.
By way of summary, Principle 6 is reiterated:Principle 6. Sentence final particles (SFPs) semantically and pragmatically
play multiple roles, and function as grounding elements though optional
(§4.2.1).
We have come to the last chapter of the grammar. A few topics on the discourseand narrative arts will conclude our journey in the next chapter.","[825, 826]"

"90Despite his own realisation that “all the Iu-Mienh [who are] highly educatedmay find words that are not precise interpretation of their meaning” (Panh 2002:
Acknowledgement), the value of native speaker’s intuition and insights reflected indefinitions given in English surpasses its occasional clumsiness by non-native speaker
of English. This value is further raised when they are used in conjunction with Purnell
(2012). For example, laaix /laːi˩˧/ is defined as ‘because of, on account of’ by Purnell(2012) with the usage note: “Although laaix can be used when the results are positive,it is most commonly used when they are negative. For positive results, weic /wei˩/ is
most often used” (2012:356). When it is compared with a few examples and theirinterpretation given by Panh (2002:132), what is meant by Purnell will become more
illuminating:laaix mienh /laːi˨˧ miən˧˩/ [because.of person] ‘to impute (a fault to another)’
laaix ninh /laːi˨˧ nin˧˩/ [because.of 3SG] ‘his or her fault’laaix yie ganh /laːi˨˧ iə˦ kan˧˩/ [because.of 1SG self] ‘my own fault’
As reflected in the element of fault, Panh expresses well the implication of speaker’s
blaming attitude in these phrases. Such subtlety is a rich asset filling these two
dictionaries of Panh.","[126, 127]"
