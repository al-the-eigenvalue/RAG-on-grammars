"7.4.2 Usage of imperfective speech marker o
The imperfective speech marker, which overlaps with the present,
habitual and future is not differentiated for gender and number. Like the
perfective speech markers it exhibits various intonation contours that can
give the clause the modal force of emphatic negation, interrogative, or
emphatic affirmative. This marker can only be used in verbal sentences.
The intonation contour for the imperfective speech markers for these
three categories is not identical to the intonation contour for the perfective
speech markers. The perfective and imperfective markers agree for the
features of level pitch and falling pitch. The major difference is the pitch
height. The intonation contour for the imperfective exhibits for all three
categories a higher onset. E.g. the glide over the interrogative o starts and
ends at a higher pitch than the glide over the interrogative speech markers
so, ko and mo. The markers for the emphatic negation and the emphatic
declarative have a level intonation contour. The relative pitch height for
the imperfective is higher than for the corresponding imperfective
markers. In an attempt not to overload the examples with too many
diacritics I have not marked this difference in pitch height between the
perfective and imperfective.
The intonation contour associated with sentences encoding the
imperfective speech markers distinguishes the interrogative (72), the
negative (73), and the emphatic declarative (74).
In (72), the imperfective interrogative speech utterance marker o
exhibits a glide that starts at a high level falling to mid.",[270]

Concepts like nothing (55), no-one (56), no way (57) nowhere (58)
etc. are expressed by the combination of an interrogative and a verb
phrase final ley. Resulting sentences are viewed by native speakers as
statements and not as questions. The interrogative precedes the verb
phrase either as an adverbial interrogative (ex. 56) or as part of a NP
(ex. 55). The verb phrase is immediately followed by a clause-final ley
that is analysed as a variant of korey ‘NEG’ (see §7.3.7 for a comparable
analysis of the dynamic modality negation liy … ley).

following three categories: interrogative, emphatic negation and emphatic
declarative. They are a feature of spoken language in direct interaction.
These markers are only used when something needs to be asked or
emphatically be declared or negated. The set of speech utterance markers
consists of the imperfective speech utterance marker o and the perfective
speech utterance markers so, ko and mo. The same set of imperfective and
perfective speech utterance markers mark the three mentioned categories.
The markers only differ in the intonation contour they carry. Specifics for
the three categories are given in Table 44.
The imperfective speech marker o and the perfective speech markers
so, ko and mo occur with the following differing intonations that
determine whether they mark the sentence for interrogative, emphatic
negation or emphatic declarative. (These diacritics are only used in this
grammar write-up but not in the currently accepted orthography.)252

various markers.
These markers have some resemblance in form to the proximal and
distal demonstratives and also to the genitive markers. The proximal
demonstrative is represented by o- (§3.6.2) and so are the imperfective
speech utterance markers. The imperfective often has present tense
reference. This is consistent with the pattern in many languages where
proximal signals cataphoric reference and more distant signals anaphoric
reference (e.g. the table at Dixon 2003:83). However, the perfective
speech utterance markers so, ko and mo do not really match the distal
demonstrative. It should be noted that they are identical in form to the
three genitive markers. They function at different levels though, one
marking embedded noun phrases and the other clauses or even sentences.
A speech utterance is not obligatorily marked with any of the markers
listed in Table 44. Many utterances like (59) can be made that have no
sentence final speech marker.

The interrogative, however, is nearly always marked with a sentence
final speech utterance marker. The use of the interrogative speech marker
is sometimes left out when an adverbial interrogative marker (§7.5.3) is253used in combination with the inchoative marker ley (§5.3.1) and the
intentional marker ey (§5.3.2). This is demonstrated in (60) and (61).

"7.2.1 The future marker a
It is noteworthy that the future marker a occurs only in affirmative
sentences when it co-occurs with either the aspect markers po ‘IMM.FUT’
or ya ‘INDF.FUT’ (see §5.2.7 where po … a and ya ... a are analysed as
discontinuous morphemes).
In (8), the future marker a co-occurs obligatorily with po ‘IMM.FUT’ in

The indefinite future markers ane and aney also occur only in
questions. Speakers tend to interchange ane and aney when editing texts.
Both markers are used to express future uncertainty and signal some sort
of predicament. There is a tendency to use ane to describe a future
predicament that seems to have no solution available and aney to describe
a predicament for which options for a resolution can be offered. In (10)
and (11), ane is used to express the lack of options the subject has to
resolve the issue at hand.

The indefinite future markers a, ane and aney can occur after the
modal marker pak ‘Dubitative’. They are used in interrogatives about
future uncertainties. The difference between pak aney and pak ane has
again to do with the level of control. When the agent has some measure of
control over future uncertainties pak aney is used (14). A low measure of
control is expressed by pak ane (15).

It is hard to determine when pak a should be used in contrast to pak
ane and pak aney. There seems to a tendency to use pak a for situations
that indicate future uncertainty which do not require immediate action to
resolve this uncertainty. This is in agreement with how ane and aney have
been analysed. Example (16) and (17) at least confirm this analysis. It
needs to be repeated though that it is hard to find unanimity among native
speakers when the three options of pak a, pak ane and pak aney are
discussed.

The negation markers, pey and pa occur clause-finally. The marker
pey is used to negate clauses with imperfective aspect and pa is used to
negate clauses with perfective aspect. As stated before, the imperfective
often has present time reference, as can be seen in (18). It is used for the
habitual (19) and (20) and can be expected to be used whenever a general
truth, or characteristic behaviour or features are described.","[249, 250, 251, 252]"

100In the next table the cognate readings are broken up into two figures.
The first number shows the number of words that are phonemically
identical. The second number after the slash indicates the number of
words that are different but can be still regarded as cognate. The total of
the two numbers should be the same as the cognate figure in the table
above. The table below shows that the number of identical words between
Yabru and Wagu is only 64% and that a third of the Wagu vocabulary
consists of words that have at least one different vowel or consonant than
their Yabru counterparts. This fact logically has a negative effect on the
ease of communication between Yabru and Wagu speakers.","[17, 18]"
"9Abau appears to be an extreme example of the tendency to
“thematisation” described by de Vries (2005: 368). He notes that in a
number of Papuan languages thematic constituents are “a juxtaposed
series of thematic constituents that have pragmatic relations of relevance
to the clauses that follow but are syntactically and intonationally separate
units.” This pattern occurs often in Abau. However, whereas in many
Papuan languages this pattern is associated with the beginning of a text
and the number of noun phrases per verb declines drastically once the
story is under way (de Vries 2005: 369), in Abau topic-marked noun
phrases remain frequent throughout entire texts.
In the typology of head-marking and dependent-marking languages
introduced by Nichols (1986), Abau is an extreme example of a
dependent-marking grammar.2 Examples of this tendency are:
a. The high proportion of nouns to verbs already described.
b. A complex system of dependent noun phrase markers which
follow almost every noun, and establish its pragmatic, syntactic
and semantic role.
c. The existence of both a gender system (marked on the noun
phrase markers), and a cross-cutting system of numeral classifiers,
used with the numerals one, two and three.
d. Verbs do not inflect for tense, aspect, mood or person. Verb stems
are affixed only for direction and manner of action. The
distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect is
indicated by clause-final particles in the case of non-indicative
clauses, and by intonation over the verb phrase for indicative
clauses.","[22, 23]"
"121.9 Abau culture
CultureThe river is viewed as the maternal uncle (kam). It is treated with
respect, because it gives water to wash and drink and it is a source of
food. The ceremonial washing that takes place in the river after an
extended time of mourning is a very important cultural event. The
cleansing water of the river enables the mourner to return to normal life
again.
Clan ties are strengthened by marriage exchange and by a number of
other customs that involve food exchanges. The most notable among them
is the custom of pig exchange. Many piglets are raised for the benefit of a
member on the maternal side of the family, who lives in expectation of
this gift for many years. The food exchange that takes place when the pig
is eaten is very significant.
ChristianityThe first Christian church workers arrived in the mid-1950s with a
Brethren Church background. Their work in Papua New Guinea was done
under the name CMML. Their main focus was literacy, medical work and
the establishment of village churches. These village churches soon started
to operate under local leadership and were called Christian Brethren
Churches (CBC). Some of the villages further away from the Green River
station have aligned themselves with other churches, e.g. Catholic Church,
Pentecostal Church and ‘Holiness’ Church.
EconomyThe Abau are river people. Their main mode of transport is by canoe.
The vast flat area of swamps, rivers and lakes accounts for their staple of
sago and fish. They can be described as hunters and gatherers, in spite of
the fact that they plant gardens. They tend not to rely heavily on their
gardens, as yearly flooding of the Sepik River often destroys their crops.
The area depends on air transport for most of its fuel and store-food
supplies. Boat transport along the Sepik is possible but slow and
expensive. Normal village life does not come with a lot of expenses with
the notable exception of the necessity to pay for high school fees. People
have tried a number of cash crops (coffee, rubber in the 1980s, and vanilla13more recently) and none of them proved economically viable, due to low
world market prices and the high costs of air transport to the nearest
coastal town Vanimo.
EducationIn the late fifties, CMML (Christian Missions in Many Lands) started
with their first literacy efforts in Tok Pisin and later also in English among
children and adults. Eventually a primary school in English for children
was established at Green River. This was the only school in the Abau area
till 1974. However, in that year the Idam government station was opened
and the Idam primary school was established. Other primary schools were
gradually added: Yabru (1978), Bifro (1980) Ibru (1982).
A few more primary schools were established in the late eighties and
nineties (Mukways, Sowkmayon, Kasiaru, Wauru and Wagu). Many of
these remote schools had their share of problems and a few negative
trends had set in. It became increasingly hard to get teachers for these
isolated village schools. Schools became understaffed or the positions
became filled by local teachers who took more liberty in being absent
from their school duties. Most of these schools (with the exception of
Green River) were too small to enroll a new first grade every year. They
only did so every other year or even less frequently. These developments
had a bad effect on the quality of education. Most children are still
enrolled in schools but the drop-out rate has increased.
A positive development was the establishment of the Green River
High School in the early nineties. This small High School can pride itself
in good academic achievements of its students that got nation-wide
acclamation.
In 1997 and 1998, Papua New Guinea implemented a dramatic
education reform of its school system. The new set-up promotes the use of
the mother tongue which became the primary language of instruction
within the Elementary School. Oral English is introduced in the last and
third year of Elementary Education. After these three years of Elementary
School the children are enrolled in the third year of Primary School.
Unfortunately, these elementary schools were established in only nine of
the 25 villages. The more remote villages missed out and have asked the
Abau Training Centre for continued assistance to run schools in the14vernacular until the provincial education office will establish an
Elementary School in their village.
Anthropological researchWell-documented anthropological research can be found on the site of
The Upper Sepik-Central New Guinea Project (http://www.uscngp.com/
papers). This research group aims “to explore the relationships between
material culture on the one hand, and language, geographical propinquity,
population, subsistence and environment on the other, in two adjacent
regions of Papua New Guinea – the upper Sepik basin and the highlands
of central New Guinea – during a relatively narrow time span before
major impact by foreign cultures.”
Of special interest is the research of Fyfe and Bolton (2010) with
their analysis of associations between string bag variability, language and
geographical distance in the upper Sepik basin and Border Mountains.
Also noteworthy is the well-written collection of Abau legends by Craig
(1980) and various other articles by the same author. Craig (1980: 8-9)
records a number of local legends which suggest that the Abau speakers
originally moved into the language area from further downstream (east)
along the Sepik.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
"8.2Sentence structureDik’s language-independent pattern-schema can be applied to the
Abau sentence structure. His basic schema is: THEME, PREDICATION,
TAIL (Dik 1980: 15).
The same schema expressed with more detail (Dik 1980: 20)
P2, P1 (V) S (V) O (V), P3
This can be adopted for the Abau language to: P2 , P1 S O V , P3
The THEME is expressed by the left-dislocated P2 position and the
TAIL by the right-dislocated P3 position. The PREDICATION is everything293in between. In this schema, S and O stand for the neutral or unmarked
positions of Subject and Object. The V indicates the position of the verb
phrase. P1, P2, and P3 indicate special positions used for special purposes,
and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation. P1 is the clause
internal topic, the P2 position is used for elements which are leftdislocated, i.e. they are outside the intonational boundaries of the clause
(cf. Dooley and Levinsohn 2001: 67-69) and the P3 is the right-dislocated
constituent or tail.
Dik (1980: 16) defines THEME and TAIL as follows:
The theme specifies the universe of discourse with respect
to which the subsequent predication is presented as
relevant.
The tail is defined as an “afterthought” to the predication,
information meant to clarify or modify it.
Dik gives an English example that follows the schema THEME,
PREDICATION, TAIL.
(1) Theme (P2)
Predicate (P1 S O V)
Tail (P3)
As for my brother, he never saw her again, the poor child.
He adds that in certain languages, constructions like this may be
strongly marked or even at the fringe of grammaticality, whereas in other
languages, they may almost represent the usual way of constructing a
sentence. He also states that the theme will very often be some term
presented in “absolute” form, i.e. without any specified semantic or
syntactic function (1980:16).
As for the predication marked by P1 S O V, Dik (1980:20-21) states
the following:
The positions marked by S, V and O are called “pattern
positions” for Subj, Verb and Obj. These are the positions
where constituents of this type end up if they have not
been brought into P1 by the rules determining the use of
this special initial position.
Dik further comments about the P1 position that “either Topic or
Focus, or both will often favour the initial position in the clause, if this is
available.” In Abau, the P1 position is always a topicalised constituent and
never belongs to the comment part of the sentence.","[306, 307]"

Apart from the interrogative speech marker, speech utterance markers
are not used extensively, since there are other devices to make declarative
sentences or to negate predications.
The emphatic declarative is used to either contradict a possible
alternative or to stress the truth value of newly given information. The
device is available but many declarative statements can be made without
using this speech utterance marker.
Example (74) appears with a sentence final emphatic declarative speech
marker o. The emphatic marker does not occur obligatorily, since (74) can
also be expressed without the emphatic speech marker as in (75).

‘He shouted, “Someone has climbed up in the mango tree and

Several devices can be used to negate utterances, making e.g. use of
the negation markers pey and pa (see §7.3.1). Emphasis can even be
added by other means than the emphatic negation markers (see §7.3.3).
These other negation constructions are far more productive. So the
previous example (73) can also be expressed as:

In verbless clauses the speech marker agrees in number and gender
with the NP topic. This is not surprising since the nature of verbless
clauses is such that only one topic is encoded. The comment constituent
only gives additional new information about the topic. In (79), the speech
marker mo agrees in number with the NP huok somokwe ‘those pigs’.

speech marker mo agrees with the NP ney homkwe ‘the children’.","[270, 271, 272, 273]"
"4.1.1 Determining the boundaries of the verb phrase
Verb phrase boundaries are defined with the help of three important
features. They are listed here in order of their usefulness in the
determination of verb phrase boundaries:
a. The beginning of the verb phrase is easily recognisable since it
always carries the most salient stress which is associated with the
highest pitch within the clause, see (1);
b. A number of markers which are not part of the verb phrase work
together to form negation and interrogative constructions that
enclose the entire verb phrase, see (2) and (3);
c. Phrases in Abau are frequently separated by distinct pauses. If
there is a pause, one can assume it marks the end of a phrase,
since a pause does not occur within a phrase. Not every phrase is
clearly separated by pauses, but there is often a distinct pause
between the last topicalised constituent within the clause and the
non-topicalised constituent following, see (4).
In (1), yaprue ‘good’ is not part of the VP since it does not carry the
most salient stress within the clause. The most prominent stress within the
clause is on lie ‘go.up’ and this signals the beginning of the VP. Therefore,
yaprue ‘good’ is analysed as a separate adverbial modifier modifying the
verb phrase.
PEAK(1) Aiai hiy ma saro somokwe
yaprue 'lie.
aiai hiy ma saro so-mo-kwe
yaprue lie
food 3S.M RCM plant DDEM-GL.PL-TOP good
go.up
‘The food that he planted grew really well.’
Secondly, a number of constructions that mark negation or questions
make use of constituents that enclose the entire verb phrase.
In (2), the VP is embraced by two constituents that express negated
dynamic modality liy … ley ‘DYN … NEG’. The modal marker liy ‘DYN’ is
not part of the VP since it does not carry the highest pitch. The negation
word ley is not part of the verb phrase since it functions at sentence level.
The VP is underlined and the onset of the VP is marked by an apostrophe.",[138]
"3.4.1 Numerals and NP order
Numerals follow the head noun of a noun phrase, and agree in class
with the noun they modify. (The twelve noun classes are discussed in
section §3.4.3). The Abau number system is limited in its scope. English
and Tok Pisin numbers are used for numbers above twelve, and often even
for numbers lower than twelve. Traditionally, there was no easy way to
express quantities above 20 or even above 12. The use of higher numbers
has been mainly introduced through the formal school system which is in
English. Abau speakers will therefore use the English forms of the
numerals even if the pronunciation of the numerals is affected by their use
of Tok Pisin and Abau. The use of the loanword numeral apparently
triggers English and Tok Pisin grammatical ordering. When an Abau
numeral is used the numeral will follow the noun as in (41).

influence of English and Tok Pisin grammatical ordering.

Abau numerals are in reasonably frequent use up to five. The numbers
six to twelve are used to a much lesser extent. Above that, the numeral for5520 is sometimes used. Table 18 indicates the various ways numbers from
4-12 as well as 20 can be expressed.

systems’. He says “the latter are used only for direct counting, or
‘mapping’ of a set of objects against some other measuring code. There
are no ‘numerals’ in a tally system, so that one may not receive a reply to56the question ‘how many?’, or find the points of the tally-system qualifying
nouns, as do true numerals. The typical tally-systems of languages of the
New Guinea area are the ‘body-parts’ counting systems.” (Laycock 1975:
219). Later, he mentions Abau as an example of a language which has
both a body-parts tally-system and a numeral system which is quinary (i.e.
has distinct numbers up to 5) (Laycock 1975: 222).
The numbers below have been observed in contexts where they
qualify nouns. This might not have been always the case. Abau speakers
have been observed to think for a short while before they can match
numbers above five with the corresponding Abau number expressions.
The attempt to use Abau number expressions to modify nouns might be
the result of education and numeracy in the English language. It has been
observed that many Abau speakers use English numerals for quantities
above five. Abau numerals are used as the following example from a
written story illustrates:

DDEM-MAN go.into
‘Fish got into (the net) to this degree, five pikes, one catfish
and ten weir fish.’3.4.3 Abau numerals one, two and three
Nouns can be divided into two groups on the basis of their gender
(masculine and feminine). They can also be divided into twelve groups on
the basis of what numeral they occur with. These numerals are in
Aikhenvald’s terminology numeral classifiers (Aikhenvald 2000: 17).
Whereas the gender of a noun is indicated through noun phrase
markers, the numeral class of a noun is determined by the set of numerals
used for 1, 2, and 3. These class concordances are only expressed by the57first three numbers. Numbers above four (see Table 18) can be used to
modify all countable nouns.
The order in which the twelve numeral classes are listed below
follows Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 745-746). The numeral classifiers
in class 1 to 7 mark relatively large groups of nouns, while the numeral
classifiers in class 8 to 12 can only be used with a small number of nouns.
This is in all likelihood caused by the fact that the numeral classifiers in
class 8 through 12 express many more specifics than only quantity. Not
only their number, but also their grouping (e.g. bundles), or their partition
(e.g. chopped-up parts) can be in focus. In English, grouping words like
flock, bunch, bundle, etc. only occur with a limited number of nouns.
Similarly, it can be assumed that Abau numeral classifiers that express
specifics about the form or compilation of the noun they modify have a
very limited distribution.
Criteria for the different classes are related to humanness, surface,
grouping, dimensionality, and extendedness. Countable nouns which
cannot be classified by their physical appearance are not restricted to one
class; they belong to classes 2, 3 or 4.
The distinction between human and non-human within the numeral
classifiers is observed by all speakers, but young people do not seem to be
aware of all the other distinctions. They tend to overuse class 2 as a
default for nearly all non-human nouns.

1.1 Location and population
Abau is a language spoken by more than 7000 people in Sandaun
(formerly West Sepik) Province, Papua New Guinea (see map 1). The
language area consists of the villages to the immediate east and west of
the Green River Station, as well as the villages along the Sepik River and
its tributaries, starting at the border with Indonesian Papua (the Indonesian
province of Papua, formerly Irian Jaya) all the way down to the border
with the East Sepik. The area depends mainly on air transport for supplies,
since there are no roads to connect the Green River Area with the coast
and transport via the Sepik River has proven to be troublesome.
MAP 1: THE ABAU AREA WITHIN PNG121.2 Language name
The language name Abau means infertile land. It is any area of open
grassy land without trees that cannot be used for food gardens. The more
than 1 kilometre long Green River Airstrip was built on such land. The
local people continued to refer to the area as Abau, and consequently the
Green River Station Area with its airstrip became known as Abau. The
name eventually transferred to the people group and the language. (The
word Abau is also used adverbially to indicate barrenness in a woman.
When following the word makwey ‘head’ it means bald.)1.3 Affiliation and earlier studies
In Wurm’s classification system (Laycock 1973; Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975; Wurm 1982), Abau is classified as an isolate at the
lowest level within the Upper Sepik Stock, Upper Sepik Super-stock,
Sepik sub-phylum, Sepik-Ramu phylum.
More recent research by Foley (2005) and Ross (2005) regards Abau
as a member of the Sepik family, related to other languages of the upper
and middle Sepik river valley, and the Sepik hill country, but not to the
languages of the Lower Sepik or Ramu families.
There have been several previous attempts at describing the Abau
language, but little published research. Wordlists were collected by patrol
officers F.R. Cawley (1919) and N.J. Cavanagh (1961); Cawley published
his wordlists in several Papua Annual Reports between 1917 and the
1930s. Kay Liddle, who was the missionary at Green River in 1960-62 for
Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML), filled seven notebooks with
texts, typical constructions, a phonemic statement and the beginnings of a
dictionary. However this material has never been published. 1
Three linguistic surveys of the language have been published. Loving
and Bass (1964) conducted a survey on behalf of the Australian
administration; they refer to the language as “Green River”, and note that
if administrative officers at Green River station learned the language, they
would be able to communicate with 3/5 of their administrative area. The
second was conducted by Donald Laycock of Australian National
University, who published a brief wordlist (Laycock 1965a) and
1Information compiled from Loving and Bass (1964); Laycock (1973); Carrington (1996).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

‘The dog was very hairy. He was not good-looking. The dog
himself did not know it.’
The first negation marker pey marks the state of affairs as a habitual
state or a general truth. The subject is not expressed in the first sentence,
but the imperfective negation marker allows the subject to be chosen from
a wide selection of possible agents, unrestricted by time. The narrator
could have used the perfective marker pa, but then the implied subject can
only be sought in the context of the story which includes the given time
frame of the story. The change of pey to pa would necessitate an241adaptation of the free translation, e.g. ‘no one considered him goodlooking’.
The second sentence is treated by the narrator as an event that is
placed in the past. It is therefore marked by the perfective negation marker
pa.","[252, 253, 254, 255]"
"7.3.2 Negating verbless clauses
The negation markers pey and pa can be used only after a VP. In order
to negate a verbless clause the negation marker lopa is used. In a verbless
clause it is used to express the absence of ownership as in (25) and (26).
(25) Hiykwe
yeyk lopa.
hiy-kwe yeyk lopa

If one wants to negate ownership one uses lopa, if one wants to negate
characteristics one uses clause-final korey.

crane PL-GEN meat GL.PL-TOP big
NEG
‘The meat of the crane bird is not very much.’
A second way to negate a verbless clause is to use the negation speech
utterance markers. The negator korey can be replaced by the negation
speech utterance marker sō. (Use of the diacritics is explained in §7.4.1)
The negation speech utterance marker expresses more emphasis than
the negator korey, as is shown in (29) and (30).",[255]
"7.3.3 Additional functions of negator korey
Korey also functions as negator of an entire discourse segment,
occurring immediately following the segment.
(31) “Hunkwe sapa mon wayr nayr so?”

2S-TOP

“Korey.”

NEG‘“Did you spend the night in the forest?” “No.”’
Korey marks emphasis when it is used in combination with one of the
clause-final negation markers pey or pa. The negation word korey occurs
before the verb phrase, as illustrated in examples (32-34).

‘As for those children, they do not have any sicknesses and

Example (35) demonstrates the most frequent use of the negator lopa,
where it follows a nominal and indicates non-possession. It negates the NP
aiai-yok ‘seedlings’.
(35) Uwr aiai-yok
lopa lwak ankin, wueir liy
uwr aiai-yok
lopa lwak ankin
wueir liy
man food-shoot NEG be
if/when garden DYN
meio ley.
meio korey
work NEG
‘If a man does not have any seedlings, he cannot work a
garden.’
A NP marked by the negation marker lopa has the opposite meaning
of a NP marked with the comitative marker non. It is the contrast between
non-possession and possession. Compare (35) and (36).
(36) Uwr aiai-yok
non lwak ankin, wueir liy meio.
uwr aiai-yok
non lwak ankin
wueir liy meio
if/when garden DYN work
man food-shoot CMT be
‘If a man has seedlings, he can work a garden.’244The negation marker lopa normally marks only nominals indicating
non-possession. It also immediately follows the nominal. The negators
pey and pa (§7.3.1) are used to negate verbal clauses as is demonstrated in
(37).
(37) Hiykwe

huok hin

huok hin
lopa
pig
shoot NEG.PFTV
‘He went into the forest, but he did not shoot a pig.’
Although not very frequent, the negator lopa can follow a verb, as in
(38), and in doing so it nominalises the clause as an event that never took
place. The noun huok ‘pig’ and the verb hin ‘shoot’ form together the
nominal construction of ‘pig shooting’.
(38) Keno hiykwe
nyo warkiayr. Hiykwe

lopa
shoot NEG.NOMS
‘Keno was a young lad. He never had (the experience) of
shooting a pig.’
The negator lopa in (39) negates the nominalised construction kuey la
‘grub-eating’. By using the negator lopa ‘NEG.NOMS’, which is used for
nominal constructions, rather than the valid alternative of the verbal
negator pey ‘NEG. IPFTV’, the speaker emphasises the absolute nonoccurrence of the event over an extended period of time.

The imperfective negation marker pey is not used in a subordinate
clause, but the perfective negation marker pa and the nominalising
negator lopa are both used. The latter might be preferred when the
complete absence of the negated activity is the focus, but the semantic
difference between the use of pa or lopa in subordinate clauses is very
small. Both negators seem to be quite interchangeable within subordinate
clauses.
When a negation marker occurs in a subordinate clause, it needs to be
followed by the stative verb lwak ‘to be’ to form a grammatically correct
sentence.
In (40), the negator lopa occurs within a subordinate clause marked
by ankin ‘if’. The negator lopa is obligatorily followed by the stative verb
lwak.

‘If the sun never shines, the trees would not bear any fruit.’
The perfective negation marker pa can also be used within a
subordinate clause, as is demonstrated in (41). The stative verb lwak is
still obligatorily present. In (41), the verb hawr ‘wash’ is followed by the
perfective negation marker pa.

combination with the stative verb lwak in a subordinate clause.","[256, 257, 258, 259]"

The relationship of logical consequence encoded by the adverbial
demonstrative object marker is not always a purely causal relationship. It
can be a circumstantial relationship where a change in circumstances
enables another event to take place.
In (64), the adverbial demonstrative sehe relates the temporal
subordinate clause marked by ankin ‘as/when’ to the event in the main
clause. The two clauses do not relate in a purely causal sense, but they
relate to each other in a logical sense. The change in circumstances as
expressed by the temporal clause, allowed the event in the main clause to
take place.

‘When father himself woke up and got up, he consequently

demonstrative sokwe relates the two clauses in a logical sense. The change
in circumstances as expressed by the temporal clause (getting closer to the
village), allowed the event in the main clause to take place (hearing the
animal’s noise). The events of the main clause are enabled, but not forced
or caused by the event expressed in the subordinate clause. The feminine
demonstrative sokwe agrees with the feminine NP object wown-oksa ke
‘cuscus-noise OBJ.F’ and not with the masculine NP subject hiykwe
‘3S.SUB’.

This chapter deals with the categories of tense, aspect and mood. As
in many other languages it is difficult to make sharp distinctions between
grammatical tense, aspect and mood, since these concepts are conflated to
some degree in Abau. The discussion in §5.1 makes clear that Abau
makes a distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect and that
the verb or verb phrase does not display tense distinctions. The markers
discussed in §5.2 all precede the verb phrase and grammatically behave
the same. Some of these markers are more modal (see §5.2.1 and §5.2.2)
and others more aspectual in nature. Finally in §5.3, the aspect and modal
markers following the verb are discussed. These markers express the
following distinctions: inchoative, intention, desirability and doubtfulness.
Markers which mark the clause for mood and negation are dealt with
in §7 where the clause-final imperative, indefinite future, interrogative,
emphatic indicative and negation markers are discussed.","[174, 175, 176, 177]"
"11Odiai (pop. 250) – also known as Busa; three village communities
located Northeast of Green River, west of the Horden River; isolate
(Lewis 2009).
Yale (Yalë) (pop. 700) – also referred to as Nagatiman; located 30
kilometres northeast of the Green River Station between the Horden and
Senu Rivers; isolate (Lewis 2009).
Amto (pop. 250) – also known as Ki; located in Rocky Peak Districts;
Amto-Musan language family (Lewis 2009).
Siawi (pop. 300) – also known as Musan; located toward the
headwaters of the Left May River on the Samaia River east of Amto;
Amto-Musan language family (Lewis 2009).
Pyu (pop. 100) – only one village community, known as Biak 2 (Biak
1 is an Abau speaking village); located near the Indonesian Border and
along the Biak River, a tributary of the Sepik River (Laycock 1973;
Conrad and Dye 1975). Laycock (1973) suggested that Pyu is related to
Kwomtari, but Baron (1983) found no evidence for this.
According to some sources (e.g. Laycock 1973; Lewis 2009), Yetfa
(Biksi) also has speakers on the Papua New Guinean side of the border,
west from the Abau language area. This was based on survey word lists
from Biak 2 village, where the primary language is Pyu. The women
surveyed had married into Biak 2 from a Yetfa-speaking village on the
Indonesian side of the border, as documented in articles on the language
by Laycock (1972), and Conrad & Dye (1975). 3 My own travels and
surveys did not lend any support to the claim that there are mother-tongue
Yetfa speakers in Papua New Guinea apart from those who have settled in
Biak 2 as a result of marriage exchange.
Namia, located east from Green River, belongs the Sepik language
family but is too far away to be considered a geographic neighbour. The
same is true for the Suganga (West-Miamin), located in the south, since
none of their village communities is found close to any Abau speaking
communities.","[24, 25]"

In (69), the concession clause is followed by the existential verb lwak

preceding negation marker (see discussion in§7.3.4). The object marker e
is harder to explain. The object marker e can be deleted without causing
grammatical changes to the sentence. Difference in meaning between
constructions with and without the object marker e have not been
discovered.

A subordinate clause constructed with the help of an adverbial
interrogative preceding the verb phrase and followed by a clause-final
aspect marker can encode indefinite manner, contents or location. The
same semantic concept is expressed in English with the help of indefinite
specifiers like ‘whatever’ and ‘wherever.’
The syntactic form of these constructions can be diagrammed as
follows:

reduplicated)VPAspect Meaning
markerperey (perey)VPewhereverperey (perey)VPleyto whereverpenkin (penkin)VPewhatever (adverbial)payVPewhatever (adjectival)The interrogatives perey and penkin can be used once in these
constructions or twice for emphasis. Example (70) would also be correct
with a single penkin and (71) would also be correct with a double perey.

‘Whatever the dog did, the wallaby was also with him doing

The difference between clause-final e and ley is related to the focus on
location (e is used) or direction (ley is used). This type of subordinate
clause is also characterised by the absence of the topic marker -kwe on the
NP preceding the verb phrase.
In (71), the subject NP of the subordinate clause wayp hiy ‘eagle’
precedes the verb phrase and is obligatorily not topic-marked with -kwe.","[391, 392, 393]"
"10
MAP 3: ABAU AND NEIGHBOURING LANGUAGESThe languages which border the Abau language area are unrelated and
show minimal affiliation between each other. The proximity of these
languages is illustrated by the fact that practically all these language
groups have at least one village community which is located within a
day’s walking distance from the Green River Government Station.
Starting near the Indonesian border and going clockwise around the Abau
language the following eight neighbouring languages are found (see
map 3):
Karkar-Yuri (pop. 1400) – north-west from Green River Station all
the way to the Indonesian border; was formerly thought to be an isolate,
but is now known to be a member of the Pauwasi family (Lewis 2009).
Angor (pop. 1200) – north of Green River with majority of villages
around Amanab; together with Dera a member of the Senagi family, and
not currently considered to be closely related to any other languages (Ross
2005).
Nai (pop. 750) – also referred to as Biaka; three village communities
between Green River Station and Amanab; related to Kwomtari; 30%
cognate (Loving and Bass 1964; Baron 1983).","[23, 24]"

When these two rules conflict, it is up to the speaker to choose which
constituent to focus on. In (83), the choice of the speech marker ko can be
defended on the basis of rule 2 and the use of the speech marker so can be
defended on the basis of rule 1. If the speaker wants to focus on the
mother as actor, ko will be selected, if the speaker wants to focus on the
child as patient so will be selected.

In summary, the object NP is the most likely candidate to govern the
number and gender of the sentence final speech marker. Normally, it is the
object NP that precedes the verb phrase, which makes the choice of gender
and number for the speech marker straightforward, since the two rules
agree with each other. In (84), it would grammatically be incorrect to
establish agreement in gender and number between the subject and the
speech marker. (The feminine speech marker ko can only be utilised if the
object NP precedes the subject NP.)

markers
A clause marked by the modal marker ey ‘intention’ or by the modal
marker ley ‘inchoative’ (§5.3) can only be followed by a perfective speech
utterance marker and never by an imperfective speech marker. In (85), ey
‘INT’ necessitates the use of the perfective interrogative speech marker sõ
in spite of the fact that the event referred to is a future event. The reason
for this phenomenon is related to the fact that ey ‘INT’ and ley ‘INCH’ are
clause-final markers. The speech utterance marker is a sentential marker.
The use of the perfective speech marker treats the sentence it marks as a
single event.

intentional marker ey. When deleted, the speech marker follows the VP
and not a clause-final marker. The predication refers to a non-finished
present time event, which means that the imperfective speech marker
needs to be selected as is shown in (87).

addressee
As stated before the perfect speech utterance markers so, ko and mo
are mainly used to mark the interrogative mood, but also to indicate
emphatic negation and emphatic declarative.
The emphatic declarative speech marker can be suffixed with an
addressee morpheme. There are three independent vocatives which are
used to address one or more persons: masculine ara, feminine akwa and
plural ama. Their independent use is exemplified in (88).

From the masculine ara, feminine akwa and plural ama a set of three
addressee suffixes -ra, -kwa, and -ma is derived. The initial a is absorbed264at the juncture when these addressee markers are suffixed to the three
emphatic declarative speech utterance markers so, ko, or mo.
When the three addressee markers are suffixed to the three speech
markers so, ko and mo a total of nine different surface forms result as can
be seen in Table 45.

distinct constituent categories. The only nuclear constituent is a minimum
of one verb from the first constituent category. Up to four verbs from this
category have been observed to co-occur within the verb phrase. The
second category consists of general qualifiers that qualify the verb for
quality or quantity. They cannot occur by themselves within the verb
phrase. The third category consists of a variety of modifiers that deal with
the three subcategories of participant interaction, time and appraisal of
process. The three subcategories can all be represented in a single verb
phrase and mostly in the order given, though exceptions to this ordering
have been observed.
As stated before, the perfective and imperfective are marked by
intonation contour. The basic contrast is the pitch over the final syllable of
the verb phrase. A large number of verb phrases only consist of members
of category one, but many verb phrases will also host members of
category two and three. The last constituent of the verb phrase is marked
for perfective or imperfective. This is not true when speech markers and
negation markers are added to the sentence. These markers are not part of
the verb phrase, but they (rather than the verb final constituent)
distinguish between perfective and imperfective (see §7.3 and §7.4).
Table 36 shows the three categories of constituent members along
with a number of examples. It should be noted that the lists of words
under the three subcategories of the third group are exhaustive. The
examples under the second category however, are part of a much larger
group with many members.
The three categories in Table 36 can be labeled as follows: category 1:
one or more verbs; category 2: qualifying adverbial modifiers; category 3:
reciprocal, temporal and evaluative modifiers.","[147, 148, 149]"

3. Use of measurement and polar questions in verbless clausesVerbless clauses do differentiate between measurement and polar
questions in spite of the fact that verbless clauses do not differentiate
between perfective and imperfective aspect. When the interrogative
speech utterance marker is needed, only so, ko and mo are selected but
never o.
In (140), the interrogative pankaw occurs clause-finally in a verbless
clause. There is no co-occurring speech marker. The question is
understood as a polar question.

pankaw?”
“Oo.”
hwon-kwe youk
po-ankaw

When the interrogative speech utterance marker is added to a verbless

7.5.3.4 Reason interrogative
The interrogative pro-word encoding reason consists of the nonhuman interrogative pay ‘what’ (derived from po-ay ‘Q-what’) followed
by the pronoun hokuaw ‘for what reason?’. Hokuaw ‘for what reason?’
has as constituents: the general topical marker ho- and -kuaw ‘for reason
of’. Hokuaw is used by itself at clause level. (See for further discussion
§6.7)288In (142) payhokuaw is used as an adverbial phrase.

‘As for that (you just said), why is it?’
In (144), payhokuaw functions as a conjunction. It is possible that this
use of the interrogative ‘why’ as ‘because’ had been influenced by Tok
Pisin, where the interrogatives bilong wanem ‘why’ and long wanem
‘because’ are used as a reason conjunction. Although the constituents of
payhokuaw ‘because/why’ correspond closely to the constituents of Tok
Pisin long wanem ‘why’, people believe that the usage of this word is true
Abau, pre-dating the advent of Tok Pisin in the area (§9.3.3).

Descriptive texts are similar to procedural texts in that they are
informative and non-emotive. Procedural and descriptive texts both make
extensive use of the imperfective, since these texts often prescribe or
describe general or habitual behaviour. This is in contrast with narrative
texts which make extensive use of the perfective to describe unique events
that in their totality took place in the past.
Whereas procedural texts are concerned with the correct manner to
perform a task, descriptive texts are concerned with the description of
observed behaviour or characteristics. Descriptive texts centre around a
global theme that is often a directly observable entity (e.g. animal, place,
custom, activity).
Descriptive texts make frequent use of verbless clauses: a topicalised
entity is supplied with a comment that either gives additional information
to that entity or supplies the entity with a certain identity. In (51), the first
topic NP is further defined for attributive characteristics, the second topic
NP is further identified for role.

Descriptive texts tend to have very few non-topicalised NPs that are
syntactically marked for subject or object. This in contrast to narrative
texts where non-topicalised NPs occur frequently. In (53-60), there is no
occurrence of a non-topicalised subject and only one example of a nontopicalised object.
Descriptive texts are also characterised by a high number of verbless
clauses or clauses formed with the stative verb lwak like e.g. (53) and411(54). The two topicalised NPs marked by mokwe occur in clauses that are
formed with the stative verb lwak. (Below in (53-60), all topic markers are
bolded.)

Non-topicalised NPs with syntactic marking are relatively rare in
descriptive texts. That is especially true for non-topicalised NPs marked
for subject and to a lesser extent for non-topicalised NPs marked for
object. The NP iwar me ‘people, human beings’ in (52) is an example of
such an occurrence.
The bolded NPs in (55) and (56) are respectively marked for object
and subject, but are topicalised as well.

Participants and props that are referred to in a descriptive text often do
not represent an individual, unique entity. This in contrast to narrative
texts, where participants and props have their own identity and often play
roles in specific, unique events. Many of the entities referred to in a
descriptive text are not uniquely identifiable entities, but often function as
representatives for their type or category. The marking on the NPs reflects
this. In (57), hmo pion mokwe ‘their meat’ has patient role, but it is not412marked for object. It is only marked by the general topic marker mokwe.
This is in line with the fact that the NP does not represent a single
identifiable entity, but represents the meat of all other wondeis-snakes as
well.

Descriptive texts can contain instructive sections that look very
similar to sections of a procedural text, e.g. the text “The snake” (§11.4)
moves from descriptive to instructive in the second part of the text. When
a descriptive text becomes instructive, an addressee is needed. Below, the413addressee is referred to by hwon ‘2S.SUB’ which functions as a universal
‘you’ taking into its scope all who hear or read this text.
In (61-63), possible scenarios are given in subordinate clauses marked
by ankin ‘if’ which are followed by a main clause expressing a command.
In (61), the command is marked by the prohibitive marker pese, and in
(63), the command is marked by the hortative marker kwa.

Hortatory discourse resembles expository discourse in that they are
both organised thematically and contain sentences that do not encode
events and are not ordered iconically. Both types of discourse want to414inform, defend a particular course of action, or express the speaker’s
viewpoint. The focus of an expository discourse is directed towards
building a sound argument, while the focus of a hortatory discourse is to
modify the addressee’s thinking or behaviour. Therefore, one will find
that a hortatory discourse is often punctuated at various intervals by valuejudgements, commands or suggestions using hortative forms and
assertions. An expository text deals with arguments and counter
arguments and the author can give a conclusion with or without
exhortation. For example, in the text on problems in childless marriages
(§11.5), the author only states his disapproval of men sending their wives
away in the final paragraph, after he has delineated arguments in favour
and against this behaviour.
Expository discourse deals with reasons, goals, contrasts,
comparisons, conditions linked to consequences, etc. The expression of
complicated ideas leads to the use of complex sentences with subordinate
clauses. An individual clause might be complex as well when e.g. a noun
is modified by embedded phrases or clauses, or when a subordinate clause
is placed in tail position when the speaker fears that the sentence might
not be fully understood.
In (64), the sentence contains a NP modified by a relative clause. It
also has an object clause in tail position. The modified NP is embedded at
two levels. The head of the NP uwr ‘man’ is marked for number by the
phrase final plural demonstrative somokwe. The NP head uwr is modified
by an embedded NP of which the head is sa ‘woman’. This head is
modified by the embedded relative clause ney lopa ma lwak. The
demonstrative seme that precedes the verb phrase establishes a logical
relationship between this clause and the previous one. The object clause in
tail position gives more detail to the idea expressed in the main clause.

‘As a result the men whose wives do not have children are
coming up with different ideas to send their wives away.’
Apart from the fact that the hortatory and the expository text differ in
focus, the discourse types have many similar features. Cohesive
connectives like seyr and sawk (§9.1) which are relatively rare in
descriptive and procedural texts often link or contrast arguments that
support the speaker’s main contentions. Conjunctions encoding reason
(payhokuaw §9.3.3), condition/circumstances (ankin §9.5.3), or logical
consequence (sehe, sokwe, seme §4.4.3) are used often.
In (65), the speaker makes use of reason and conditonal conjunctions
and links his argment to (66) by means of the contrastive connective sawk.
The speaker contrasts the group of men with children and the group of
men without children. All the conjunctions and cohesive markers in (6568) are bolded.

‘But those without children experience hardships, when they

Subordinate clauses normally precede the main clause, but in (66) the
temporal clause is placed in tail position. As stated before, the tail position
is not used for new information. The speaker simply wants to avoid
ambiguity and adds the subordinate clause to make explicit what could
have been understood from the context already.
Quotes are introduced by the adverbial manner demonstrative senkin
(§4.4.2). The two consecutive arguments in (67-68) are linked by the
cohesive marker seyr ‘and, also’. The marker seyr links entities that are
similar to each other (§9.1.3). In this case it links two quotes that argue in
favour of the same point.

‘Paul’s letter states as follows, “In the present time the

A hortatory text is marked by frequent exhortations. The examples
below are taken from a speech by the local government member exhorting
the people to show up for the village work party the next Monday (§11.6).
The arguments used are a combination of veiled threats and appeals to
parental concern for the well-being of their children. The speaker portrays
himself both as the village leader they need to obey and as the concerned
father figure who looks after everyone’s well-being.
His discourse expresses three times a general command to look well
after the Aid Post. This can be done by an adhortative command (§7.1)
with the clause-final goal marker e as is done in (69).

questions that underline his arguments. Example (70) is a question which,
though answered, is rhetorical in nature. It emphasises the fact that no
alternatives for medical help are available. In (71), the speaker emphasises
this point by listing the potential difficulties the people are likely to
encounter if no action is taken.

It is very rare that the main point of a public hortatory speech is made
in the opening lines and then followed by supporting evidence. A speaker
prefers to pave the way for his main point by mentioning supporting419reasons and arguments first. He anticipates potential resistance to his
opinion or proposal and tries to answer these objections before he comes
to his main point.
The local parliament member in his speech about the Aid Post had as
goal to make the village people show up for community work on Monday.
This point is only made towards the end of the speech (73), after the
benefits of having the Aid Post have been mentioned and negative
scenarios of the village without an Aid Post have been stressed. Even
then, the speaker stays away from a direct command, but rather describes
what should happen when he asks the people to work on the Aid Post.

Personal letters have several features which distinguish them from
other thematically organised texts. They have five components:
a. name of the addressee;
b. introductory greetings;
c. stage setting or introduction to the main point;
d. main point or request;
e. closing, which has the writer’s signature.","[421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433]"
"1.10 Acknowledgements
This current grammar write-up is based on research conducted by me
over a period of more than 20 years under the auspices of the Papua New
Guinea Branch of SIL International. My wife and I learned to speak the
language, collected stories and studied the local culture. We were able to
involve a large number of Abau speakers in the establishment of the
current orthography and in the development of a three year curriculum in
the vernacular for the 25 Abau speaking villages along the Sepik River.
The vast majority of the examples in this grammar paper have been taken
from a corpus of non-elicited texts of 85,000 words.
We want to thank the Yabru community for allowing us to live among
them since September 1982. We especially thank our friends and fellowworkers Obow Inaru and Alex Nomben, who, along with many others,
have helped us to gain many valuable insights into the language.
A special word of thanks goes to our colleagues within SIL whose
encouragement and input have been essential in gaining insights in the15structure of the Abau language. I want to thank Bob Conrad not only for
his assistance in producing the Abau Grammar essentials in 1985
(unpublished manuscript) but also for his willingness to be one of the
editors in the final stages of the current document. Secondly, I want to
thank the late Cindi Farr for her enthusiasm and keen insights into how
information is marked for relative prominence within Abau texts. A major
part of this paper was finished under her supervision in 1999.
In 2007, I was encouraged to make the research available to the wider
public. SIL colleague Ian Tupper probed me with many questions about
the wording of certain sections that needed further work. He also kindly
gave me many suggestions and editorial comments for the other sections. I
believe they have improved the overall clarity of this grammar. Thanks
are also due to Lisa Halverson who did a fine job in preparing the
manuscript for publication, John Carter who produced two of the maps,
several people in Ukarumpa who did the final proofreading and René van
den Berg who oversaw the whole process as series editor.
Lastly, I want to thank my wife Maija for her encouragement and
support. The current grammar write-up does not reflect sufficiently the
many warm and meaningful friendships she helped to develop with our
Abau friends.","[28, 29]"
"3.11.1 Zero marking as a result of noun incorporation
Zero marking on nouns can partly be explained by the occurrence of
noun incorporation. Mithun (1984:848-9) states:
Compounding is done for a reason. Some entity,
quality, or activity is recognised sufficiently often to
be considered name-worthy in its own right. … Such
compounding has a significant effect on the role of
the N involved. In He is off berry-picking, the word
berry does not refer to a specific berry, nor to a
particular bushful of berries: it qualifies the V,
describing the type of picking in progress. Because it
does not refer, it is not marked for definiteness or
number.
Noun incorporation in Abau is indicated by the juxtaposition of an
unmarked object NP with a verb. As Mithun stated the noun is indeed “not
marked for definiteness or number” and occurs without any object
marking that is normally expected for nouns having patient role. In spite115of the close relationship between the unmarked noun and the verb it
precedes, the Abau noun does not become part of the verb phrase as is
further explained below.
Noun phrases that are frequently zero marked are incorporated nouns
acting as patient. These nouns do not need to be recognised as definite,
unique entities, since the activity the patient is involved in is in focus,
rather than the patient itself. In (164), the nouns naw ‘sago’ and yayh
‘song’ do not need to be recognised as definite, unique entities. The focus
is on the activity that is expressed by the noun in combination with the
verb phrase (‘sago making’ and ‘sing-sing dancing’).

In (166), the N V construction wueir meio can be glossed ‘garden
working’. This construction specifies the type of work, namely garden
work; it does not refer to a specific garden. Therefore the noun wueir is
not marked as the object of the clause. In the second clause, the noun
phrase wueir-aiai senkin senkin (various kinds of garden produce) is
marked by the plural objective pronominal marker me, because it refers to
a specific activity in a specified location.

combines with the verb to specify a generic activity. However, in (168),
yayh ‘song’ refers to identifiable songs which were practised. Therefore
the noun phrase is marked as the object of the clause.

Noun incorporation in Abau is marked by the absence of the object
marker on the NP. The noun is placed as close as possible to the verb
phrase. However, modal and negation markers and interrogatives can
intervene between the noun and the verb phrase. In other words, the noun
and the verb do not combine into a single word, as in the English example
‘berry-picking’ above. In (170), the noun is separated from the verb
phrase by a negation marker, and in (171) by an interrogative.

In spite of the fact that modal markers and interrogatives may
intervene between a zero marked noun and the verb phrase, Abau117recognises a form of noun incorporation that is manifested by NPs that are
not marked and consist of a single noun. Table 32 gives a number of
examples of noun incorporation that occur so frequently that they behave
as formulaic expressions in Abau. Noun incorporation accounts for most
of the zero marking on noun phrases.

Above it was stated that noun incorporation is restricted to unmarked
NPs that consist of one single noun. NPs consisting of more than one
member can occur with zero marking on the NP. They are left-located and
occur even sentence initial. This left dislocation is normally reserved for
all topicalised NPs. Sentence-initial NPs with zero marking are rather rare
and therefore noteworthy.","[128, 129, 130, 131]"
"23In example (1), syllable breaks are marked by full stops. Word initial
stress is marked by number 1 and the gradual falling tone over the
syllables by lower numbers. The numbers given only indicate the relative
pitch within each word. A syllable carrying a higher pitch than the
previous syllable always marks the onset of a new word and is therefore
marked by 1 regardless of its absolute value in terms of pitch or intensity.
In (1) the word me has a higher pitch than the final syllable ma in the
previous word and therefore me is regarded as a separate word, in spite of
the fact that its pitch is lower than the onsets of the other words in the
utterance, and even lower than the pitch on the second syllable in a.ni.ma.

The distribution of the primary stress is used as a criterion for
marking word boundaries. The following rule can be formulated: A pitchcarrying unit should be analysed as the onset of a new word, whenever
this unit carries a higher pitch than its preceding unit.
The converse of this rule is not true. It is possible that a pitch-carrying
unit with a lower pitch than its preceding unit is the onset of a new word.
In (2), pa cannot be marked as a new word on the basis of the pitch
distribution, since pa does not carry a higher pitch than the preceding ley.
However, these two pitch-carrying units are separate words as is
demonstrated in (3).

‘I did not go to the forest.’
In (3), the verb ley is replaced by a three-syllable verb lanio. The pitch
over the unit pa is higher than the pitch over the final syllable of lanio,
thus indicating a word break. On the basis of example (3) and others like
it, the negation marker pa is given its own word status.

nominal phrase occurs on the head noun.
Word boundaries are also determined on the basis of vowel
distribution. Abau recognises two [+high] vowels (i, u) and three [-high]
vowels (e, a, o). A restriction on the distribution of the vowels is that no
sequences of low vowels are allowed. In (4), no word boundary between
lira and o can be marked on the basis of pitch difference. However, a
word boundary can be marked on the basis of vowel distribution. As ao is
disallowed in Abau, lira and o are analysed as separate words.

The following morphophonemic changes only occur within a verb or
between verbs. An initial lateral l- on a verb reduces to zero in the
following environments:
Rule A: the verb is prefixed by a verbal prefix ending in a consonant
or high vocoid (includes semi-vowels y and w.);
Rule B: the verb is preceded by another verb.
Morphophonemic Rule A is exemplified in Table 8. The verbal
prefixes listed in the first column cause the deletion of initial l-.","[36, 37, 38]"
"8.1Defining topicTopic or givenness (which often implies definiteness) in Abau is
marked by -kwe and refers to all information that the speaker assumes is
present or readily accessible in the addressee’s consciousness. Chafe
(1976:30) defines givenness and the problems related to this choice of
terminology this way.
Given (or old) information is that knowledge which the
speaker assumes to be in the consciousness of the
addressee at the time of the utterance. So-called new
291292information is what the speaker assumes he is introducing
into the addressee’s consciousness by what he says. The
terminology has been and continues to be misleading to
linguists and psychologists who use it. Calling something
‘old information’ suggests it is ‘what the listener is
expected to know already’ and ‘new information’ is ‘what
the listener is not expected to know already,’ something
that is being introduced into the addressee’s knowledge
for the first time… But a speaker who says ‘I saw your
father yesterday’ is unlikely to assume that the addressee
had no previous knowledge of his father, even though by
the usual criteria your father would be considered new
information. The point is that the speaker has assumed
that the addressee was not thinking about his father at the
moment. Terms like ‘already activated’ and ‘newly
activated’ would convey this distinction more accurately,
but are awkward; we will probably have to live with the
terms ‘given’ (or ‘old’) and ‘new’.
In Abau, the topic marker -kwe marks information that the speaker
presents as background information, whether or not the addressee has
ready access to it. Constituents marked by the topic marker -kwe occur
sentence initially. The topicalised constituents form together the setting or
the background against which the rest of the predication is asserted. This
topic part sets the stage for the rest of the predication. Participants and
props are mentioned as part of this stage setting. The comment part of the
sentence expresses new information.","[305, 306]"
"3.2.4 Exocentric noun compounds
At least two types of exocentric compound nouns have been observed
where the constituents making up the compound noun belong to different
word classes.
1. A juxtaposed verb and noun forming a compound noun, whereby
the verb modifies the noun for category. (30)
2. A juxtaposed modifier and noun forming a compound noun,
whereby the modifier modifies the noun category. (31)

‘They were not “good people”.’3.3Nouns and genderAbau has both gender (masculine/feminine) and a cross-cutting
system of numeral classifiers, as do the related languages Iwam,
Wogamusin and Chenapian (Laycock and Z’graggen 1975). This feature
is also characteristic of some Indic, Dravidian, Iranian and Arawak (South
America) languages (Aikhenvald 2000: 185). As stated before, number
and gender are not marked on the noun word itself but are indicated by
pronouns, demonstratives, numerals and other grammatical markers that
follow the noun. The relationship between gender and number classifiers
is discussed §3.4.6.",[60]

When one wants to express that a certain state or activity ceased to
exist and will continue to be in this ceased state for the indefinite future,
the negation marker pase NEG.CNT is used in combination with a clausefinal object marker e. The negation construction is best translated in
English by ‘not anymore’.
This negation is not used in the imperative mood like the prohibitive,
but is utilized in the indicative mood. The negation marker pase … e has
as its focus a continuing negated state of affairs. In (51), it expresses the
notion that a certain action that was part of the past will not happen in the
future anymore.","[261, 262]"

De Vries (2005: 367) makes the point that Papuan languages
generally give the noun phrase a low priority.
In the majority of Papuan languages the verb is the head
of the verbal clause, and the only obligatory constituent.
The nominals in the clause could be considered optional
modifiers of this head… Many Papuan languages avoid
nouns and anaphoric use of independent pronouns to an
extreme extent in referent tracking, especially in the
tracking of active or given subject and object referents.
Abau does not fit this particular categorization of Papuan languages.
Clauses in Abau without a noun phrase are extremely rare. Also noun
phrases which are not overtly marked for their specific role are relatively
rare. The vast majority of noun phrases are marked for their pragmatic,
semantic or syntactic function to such an extent that the unmarked noun
phrase stands out because of its relative rareness.
Abau has a rich inventory of markers which occur by themselves NP
finally and which contain much grammatical information. Himmelmann
(2001: 838-839) calls these syntactic noun phrase markers pronominal
articles and Tupper (2009) makes mention of the usage of similar
pronominal articles in the neighbouring Namia language.
The vast majority of Abau noun phrases occur with a terminal phrase
marker. They can be non-syntactic pragmatic markers (§3.6 and Table
23), syntactic markers (§3.7, §3.8 and Table 28), and semantic markers
indicated by postpositions (§3.9 and Table 29). The tables referred to give
exhaustive lists of the various categories. We have analysed all the
pronominal forms listed in §3.6 through §3.9 as NP markers rather than as
a pronominal copy NP.
Noun phrases with zero marking are relatively rare. Within a narrative
text less than 10% of the noun phrases have zero marking (see §3.11).
3334Pragmatic marking is realised with the help of the topic marker -kwe
which cannot occur by itself, but is always suffixed to a pronoun.
The NP final marking not only marks the NP for its syntactic, semantic
and/or pragmatic role, but in most cases also reflects the gender and/or
number of the head of the NP. Many of these markers are also affixed for
demonstrative force. These demonstratives need to be explained against
the background of their counterparts which do not have deictic force. For
that reason the demonstratives are not in one section but are discussed in
various sections. The manner demonstrative in §3.5.5, the non-syntactic
demonstrative in §3.6.2, the syntactic demonstrative in §3.8.
Summary overview of Chapter 3:
It basically describes the structure and function of nouns and noun
phrases. It includes sections on the form and use of personal pronouns
(§3.1); the form, use and gender of the noun (§3.2, §3.3); numerals (§3.4)
and adjectives (§3.5). An extensive overview of all pragmatic (§3.6),
syntactic (§3.7, §3.8) and semantic (§3.9) noun phrase markers. The
chapter concludes with a full discussion of the structure of the noun
phrase (§3.10) and the absence of NP marking (§3.11).","[45, 46, 47, 48]"

In (84), the head of the noun phrase sa-nawp ‘woman-old’ is modified

topic marker kokwe.

In (85), the embedded relative clause is negated. It is not possible for
the feminine topic marker kokwe to immediately follow an embedded
clause that has a negation marker. This is not surprising since the
imperfective negation marker pa is a clause marker, while the feminine
topic marker kokwe is a phrase marker. Based on the fact that the relative
clause marker ma occurs twice within the noun phrase, we need to
conclude that we have two embedded clauses within the noun phrase. The
first relative clause marker is part of the relative clause that modifies the
head of the noun phrase sa-nawp. ‘old woman’ The second relative clause
marker ma is part of the relative clause ma lwak, which has as its scope
the NP head plus the negated first relative clause. The feminine topic
marker kokwe terminates the NP and, as in the other two examples, agrees
in gender and number with the head of the NP sa-nawp ‘old woman’.

In (86), the underlined embedded phrase relativises an ellipted noun

clause that modifies an ellipted noun as is demonstrated in (87). A relative
clause consisting of the relative clause marker ma and the stative verb
lwak follows the first embedded relative clause. The second relative
clause has as its scope the same head plus the first relative clause.

action
The adjectival clause discussed in this section is similar to the relative
clause in that the modifying clause appears between the head noun and the
NP marker which indicates the grammatical function of this head noun.
However, relative clauses are marked by the relative clause marker ma
and the adjectival clause discussed in the section does not make use of the224marker ma, which sets this modifying clause apart from the relative
clause.
The function of this modifying clause is not to identify a referent, but
to add extra information to an already identified referent. The verbal
action expressed in the adjectival clause takes place simultaneously with
the action of the clause it is embedded in.
In (88), the clause hyo wayh hiy kan ke lorok ho ‘his friend was
standing and making a rope’ is an embedded adjectival clause which is not
marked by the relative clause marker ma. The adjectival clause refers to
an action that is in progress simultaneously with the action of the main
clause as indicated by the verb phrase le ira ‘came look’. The object
marker se agrees in number and gender with the head of the noun phrase
wayh ‘friend’.

‘He came and saw his friend, who was standing and twisting a
ring rope (= used for climbing coconuts) at the base of a

In (89), the adjectival clause hiy naksaw ‘which was grunting’ is also
formed without the relative clause marker ma. The clause is therefore
analysed as indicating simultaneity in the actions of the main clause and
the adjectival clause.

(90).

constituent of a verbless clause
The comment constituent of a verbless clause can be modified with a
relative clause. It requires the use of the comitative postposition non
preceded by a syntactic NP marker. In order to understand this somewhat
complex construction, it is helpful to look at some examples that do not
contain relative clauses but that display a similar noun phrase marking.
As stated before most verbless clauses can be divided into a topic part
of often one, but possibly more topicalised constituents; and a comment
part which is basically a non-topicalised constituent which supplies a
comment on the most important topic constituent (See examples (1)-(4),
(6) and §6.2).
It is possible, though, to state only the comment, which means that the
verbless clause has no expressed topicalised constituent, but only a nontopicalised constituent. This often happens for titles of stories, or for short
headings that specify only the subject that will be discussed. The basic
construction of these type of clauses is as follows:
A noun word followed by a syntactic subject NP marker which is
marked by the comitative non. The syntactic marker loses it subject force
since it is marked by the postposition non.
In (91), the entire clause is analysed as the comment part. Therefore,
by definition, the NP marker hom ‘2/3PL’ is not topicalised. The NP marker
marks the head noun for number.","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239]"
"9.2.2 Discourse cohesion markers sei and hai
The cohesion markers sei and hai are similar in distribution. They
occur clause-initially and are often set apart by a pause from the rest of the
clause. They are also semantically very similar. Their use not only
validates the sentence or discourse that went before as true, it also views it
as completed. The function of the cohesion markers is to bring closure to
what went before and to initiate a new starting point for the evolving
discourse. Some speakers use the two markers interchangeably, although
others feel they should be distinguished. Based on the observations of the
latter group the following distinctions are noted:
a. Sei ‘all right’ often expresses agreement to an already known or
anticipated plan of action, while hai ‘O.K.’ may introduce or
suggest a yet unknown or not expected plan of action.
b. Sei is mostly used in direct speech and not in descriptive texts.
c. Hai ‘O.K.’ is often used in questions.
d. Hai is also often used in procedural text introducing new steps or
activities. (Some speakers will use sei in procedural texts as well.)
Sei ‘all right’ often expresses agreement as can be seen in (13) and
(14).

to the sentence it precedes. It is used in conversation to request special
attention for the statement it introduces. It is often used in questions as in
(15).

The cohesive marker seseyn can be paraphrased as ‘it was done as
was said’. It occurs sentence-initially and is often set apart from the rest of
the clause by a pause. This marker takes into its scope previous discourse
and relates it to the predicate following, marking this predicate in
accordance with the discourse that went before. Seseyn is always followed
by a distinctive pause. In (17), seseyn refers back to a single sentence:
(17) Hom me,

lake in preparation.”’ (Context: Part of the group goes out
before the others to start the process of stirring up poison in
the water to kill the fish. The rest of the group joins in later
when the poison starts to take effect.)
In (18), seseyn occurs sentence-initially. It takes into its scope the
previous sentence, and connects it to the predication following, marking
the latter in accordance with the former.","[365, 366, 367]"
"118In (172), the NP object hno ihey mo yeyk is separated from the rest of
the predicate by a pause which is marked by a comma.

‘Your plane (lit. ‘your white man’s canoe’) - I have paid for

A zero marked sentence-initial NP is more prominent than a sentence
initial topic-marked NP. It could be seen as a way to mark both the topic
one wants to discuss and the comment made on the topic as new
information. In the example above the option of flying home by plane was
not mentioned within the text. The introduction of the very topic was new
information as well as the comment that the ticket had already been
bought.
The unexpected fronting of the NP signals pivotal material, crucial to
the development of the utterance argument (sometimes contrasting with
the addressee’s pre-conceptions). Even if the introduction of the topic by
means of a zero marked NP has the flavour of new information, the
subsequent comment made about the NP contains the most prominent new
information.
Thus a zero marked left-dislocated NP is analysed as a NP that
introduces a relatively unexpected topic that still requires further
commentary. In other words: although backgrounded to the information
presented in the sentential core, a zero-marked left-located NP is much
higher on the scale of prominence than a topic-marked NP without case
marking, the default mechanism for giving background information (see
§8.6 for more on prominence). The difference between a zero marked and
a topicalised left-located NP is demonstrated by comparing the nearly
identical examples (173) and (172). The fronted NP in (172) is only
marked by a pause, the fronted NP in (173) is marked by a general topic
marker. The fronted NPs in both examples are viewed as background
information, but the NP in (172) is the more prominent of the two.","[131, 132]"

Example (174) is taken from the story of the two brothers (see

he expresses the fear that his shoulder might be pulled off. The shoulder
was not mentioned yet and the topic hano someykyow (my shoulder) is
introduced as a new topic, which is indicated by the absence of marking

with only a stative verb
Lack of case marking also characterises NPs with comment function in
verbless clauses or clauses with the existential/stative verb lwak ‘be’ by
definition. The comment slot cannot be topicalised, as it contains the
information that the speaker wants to treat as new.
In the verbless sentence (175), kaman ‘wild pig’ is an unmarked NP
with comment function.

relatively few examples of contrastive lexical tone pairs have been
discovered so far”. Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 744-5) queried the
correctness of Bailey’s claim that Abau was tonal, since it countered a
previous statement by Laycock (1965b) that Abau, Iwam and Wogamusin
are not tonal. Foley cites Bailey’s observations (1986:64). We have found
no evidence of a system of lexical tone or for the tone distinctions on
nouns and verbs that were presented by Bailey (1975: 32-37). The
minimal pairs Bailey listed all proved to be incorrect interpretations, see
Lock (2007: 21-22).
The stress in Abau always occurs word initially. Bailey never
commented on stress. Laycock (1965b) states that stress occurs word
initially, or occurs on the second syllable when the word contains /ə/. As
stated before, the current analysis does not have this central vowel. Six of
the seven examples with /ə/ mentioned by Laycock (1965b:117) are
analysed currently as /o/. These words have the stress on the first syllable
(e.g. hohkwe ‘the two of them’). The phoneme /ə/ in the seventh word is
analysed as /ow/ (low ‘to defecate’).
In defining the syllable we will rely on a basic phonological
assumption, that the same sequential constraints which operate at the
beginning of a word are also operative at the beginning of a syllable, even
if this syllable does not occur word initially. Similarly, the same21sequential constraints which operate at the end of a word should be
operative at the end of a syllable.
The following word initial consonant clusters have been observed.
When they occur word medially, they are analysed as occurring syllable
initially.

long orthography conference was organised in Yabru village which was
attended by educated and influential Abau speakers. The goal was to
determine the orthography of the Abau language on the basis of long word
lists that focused on phonemes in various environments and on particular
contrasts and minimal pairs. It also exposed the conference participants to
the various ways Abau people had spelled in testing situations. See Lock
(1993) for more information on the procedures and the reasons behind this
orthography conference.
Based on the recommendations of this conference, the orthography
follows the phonemic analysis with two exceptions:
1. The phoneme /r/ is represented in the orthography by <r>,<l> and <d>.
The following spelling rules determine the available alternatives:
a. Word initial /r/ is written as <l>.
e.g. /reir/ ‘take out’ is spelled as: <leir>
b. /r/ is written as <d> preceding /n/
e.g. /yorney/ ‘finger’ is spelled as: <yodney>
c. /r/ is written as <r> elsewhere.
e.g. /hror/ ‘the two of us’ is spelled as: <hror>
2. Word initial clusters of a high vowel and a low vowel are written with
an extra word initial semi-vowel that will agree with the high vowel for
the feature [back]. Thus:
a. /#iV/ is written as <yi>V
e.g. /ia/ ‘fire’ is spelled as: <yia>
b. /#uV/ is written as <wu>V
e.g. /ueir/ ‘garden’ is spelled as: <wueir>2.5Word boundaries and stressThe phonological word is defined as a unit with one primary stress. In
Abau, primary stress is associated with the first syllable of the
phonological word. The syllable with primary stress is assigned higher
pitch and intensity than the other syllables. The lowest pitch occurs on the
last syllable.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

The markers pese …o obligatorily bracket the VP of the clause to
encode the prohibitive. The prohibitive marker pese seems to be
interchangeable with peie. No differences in use and meaning have been
discovered. Both markers always co-occur with the speech marker o that
follows the verb phrase immediately.
The marker pese (or peie) always immediately precedes the VP. The
clause-final o is analysed as a direct speech marker that marks emphasis.
Clause-final o can mark negation (see §7.4.2), but based on the low pitch
over the vowel the marker is analysed as an emphatic marker.
In (43-45), the markers pese … o embrace the VP. The scope of
negation covers all the constituents of the underlined VP.

can fill the comment slot in a verbless clause (105).
The question in (105) is asked of a female. This information is carried
by the feminine speech marker ko that follows the interrogative.

As stated above, the basic form for the personal interrogative is poso.
The genitive would be *poso-o, which reduces by vowel syncope to poso.

interrogative.

In (109), the speaker anticipates that the answer to the question is a
single recipient and therefore the singular speech marker so is used. If the
speaker does not know if the answer will refer to a male or female
recipient, the masculine speech marker so is used. The feminine speech
marker ko is only used if the speaker knows that the recipient of the knife
is a female.
7.5.1.2 Non-human interrogative functioning as head of the NP
The non-human interrogative is pay ‘what’, derived from with the
interrogative prefix po- and the suffix -ay. (Vowel syncope rule:
VoØ/_V# )
This question word is used to seek to establish the identity of nonhuman entities which includes animals (but not spirits) and all nonanimate nouns. The interrogative is marked for gender and number by a
separate pronoun or marker following the interrogative. The interrogative
can be followed by some of the postpositional markers or by a pronoun
that is syntactically marked for object and subject.
When the non-personal interrogative functions as subject, it is
obligatorily copied by a personal subject pronoun suffixed with -kwaw.
The marker -kwaw is analysed as the restrictive marker (see §3.1.4). In
combination with the non-human interrogative it can be translated as
‘what in particular’. In (110), hiykwaw follows the interrogative pay:pay mepay homkwawPLpay monwith Locative(113)pay sokwith PunctiliarEx.pay nonNPPostpositionalwith Comitative(111)pay se/ kepay hohkwawDU(110)pay keobservedpay hokwawS.FModifierpay seNotpay hiykwawS.MObject NPGenitiveSubject NPTABLE 48: NON-HUMAN INTERROGATIVE - IDENTIFICATION OF NON-HUMAN OBJECTS(117)pay NOUNModifier

The three location interrogatives in this section poho, pokwo and
pomo are used exclusively as the comment constituent in verbless
questions. They are frequently used to seek information about the location
of an entity (114).

Location is always the focus, except when one wants information
about a person’s name. This is an interesting exception. Names in the
local culture form a major part of a person’s identity and their use (and
especially non-use) is controlled by many cultural customs. It is not
always appropriate to directly ask a person’s name. It is possible that these
cultural sensitivities have influenced the form of questions about names.
Example (116) contains a request to give name identification.

A number of interrogatives may precede the head of the NP. In that
position they classify the head phrase for categories as location, kind,
manner, uniqueness etc. The interrogative forms together with the noun it
precedes a unified stress unit. This stress unit is exceptional in the sense
that the interrogative takes the initial stress within the NP. This stress
contour is somewhat similar to the stress contour over compound nouns,278where the initial noun always has the primary stress, even when the first
noun within the compound noun modifies the second.
The following interrogatives can take the role of modifier within the
noun phrase.
pay
– non-human entity identification
poso – human entity identification
perey – location identification
penkin – manner identification
pohiy, pohok, pohom – request identification in contrast to other
known entities (§7.5.2.1)
In (117), pay precedes the head of the NP and displays a very
prominent stress and forms with the noun it modifies one unified stress
unit. The interrogative is used to ascertain a certain subset of the entity it
modifies.

The interrogative poso can be a modifier in a NP preceding the head of
the noun phrase as is exemplified in (118) and (119). The interrogative
poso is not an embedded NP marked for genitive case here as is true for
(106) and (107). In a genitive construction two entities are compared with
each other: the owner and the owned. In the examples below, however,
there is only one entity within the NP whose identity is enquired after by
means of the modifying interrogative.","[286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292]"
"8.6.1 Changing prominence of subject
Normal order within Abau is SOV, but based on prominence choices
a speaker can change this order. In (47), the order is changed to OSV. The
object NP Keno se kokwe is obligatorily topicalised, because it has been
left-located and is therefore placed in the topic part of the sentence (see325§8.3). The topicalised object precedes the non-topicalised subject ur hiy
‘vine 3S.SUB’, and as a result the subject is part of the comment part of the
sentence (see §8.4). The subject NP becomes the most prominent NP at the
expense of the object NP, which would have been the most prominent
constituent in an SOV clause.

‘In regard to Keno, (it was) a vine (that) wrapped around him
causing him to fall.’
In the example above the subject was given more prominence. It is
also possible to suppress the subject. A subject has to be expressed when
the object is not topicalised, but one can omit the subject if the object NP
is topicalised by -kwe. In examples (48) and (49) respectively, hmekwe
‘3PL.OBJ.TOP’ and hye kokwe ‘3S.M.OBJ.TOP’ are understood to undergo
the events encoded in the respective VPs. This construction is widely used
when there is no need or no desire to express the agent of the predication.

In (76), the relative clause contains the noun aio ‘father’, which is

‘3S.M.SUB’. This subject is not marked by the topic marker -kwe, as no
topic-marking with -kwe can occur within the relative clause. The NP that
is modified by the relative clause is marked by the feminine topic marker
kokwe which agrees in gender and number with the head of the NP

The head of a relative clause is sometimes only understood but not
expressed. In (79), a clause that has the features of a relative clause,
modifies a temporal NP head that is not expressed. The meanings of (78)220and (79) are very similar. They are also grammatically not very different.
The first part of (78) is analysed as a noun phrase containing a modifying
clause. The first part of (79) also contains a modifying clause, but the
head of the NP has been ellipted.

‘When he spent the night in the garden house, the devil
woman from the swamp climbed up (to the house) during the

In (80), the singular phrase final marker hokwe does not correspond in
number with the plural subject hom, but with the deleted antecedent
enekwei, which is singular and masculine. Although this construction
clearly derives from a relative clause that modifies a headless relative
clause, it functions as a temporal clause which is further discussed in
§9.5.1.

‘When they went to the garden, he went to cut trees during the

The non-expressed antecedent for relative clauses does not always
refer to time. The meaning of the non-expressed antecedent is determined
by context and grammatical features. Examples of deleted antecedents are
generic entities such as ‘the fact that’ or ‘the thing’ or ‘the place’.
Example (81) is taken from a text where a man sits high in a tree until a
bird comes to the place where he is. The NP containing the relative clause
is marked by the locative mon, which modifies the ellipted noun for221location. In this context the relative clause hiy ma liwak means ‘where he
sat’ and it modifies an unexpressed noun that in the English translation
could be rendered as ‘the place’.

In (82), the relative clause hano makwey mon ma non-iarok kreysysar
also modifies a non-expressed NP head. The numeral kreysyar which
terminates the relative clause together with the objective demonstrative
eme indicates that the unexpressed noun is related to countable objects.
The English translation expresses the deleted antecedent as ‘the things’.

The negation of a relative clause is slightly complex. A relative clause
is negated by the existential verb lwak preceded by the relative clause
marker ma. Three related examples below give a build-up in the
complexity of the structure of a negated relative clause. Example (83)
contains a topicalised NP that has patient role. The NP is not marked by an
object marker but only by the feminine topic marker kokwe preceding a
non-topicalised subject and the verb phrase.","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235]"
"1.8 Neighbouring languages
The Abau language area is located in an area of extreme linguistic
diversity. Foley (2005) marks Abau as the westernmost member of the
Sepik language family, along with languages downstream from it. The
Sepik language family includes Namia, Ak, Pouye and Iwam but none of
these languages can be regarded as a close geographic neighbour.",[23]

c. Adverbial interrogatives (§7.5.3). The latter group is discussed in
chapter seven together with other types of interrogatives. The
adverbial interrogatives function as adverbial phrases in a similar
way to the two groups above.
Some of the shared characteristics of these adverbial phrases are:
a. By definition they are never topicalised.
b. They immediately precede the VP, although modal and negation
markers can intervene.
c. They consist of only one word.","[165, 166]"
"3.5.1 The extent of the use of adjectival constructions
The number of adjectives is very low. It covers in broad strokes the
range of sizes (e.g. aiopey ‘big’, sowpwareney ‘small’, mei ‘long’, hiymiy
‘tall’, etc.), age (e.g. naw ‘old’, iwon ‘young’ or ‘new’) and various
quality indications (piap ‘bad’, yaprue ‘good’,’ ihey ‘excellent’).
Colours are not really adjectives but are descriptive of other items that
reflect that particular colour, e.g. or ‘black ‘ also means ‘burnt wood’. Ou
‘red’ is also used in compound nouns that contain reddish colours, e.g.
yoh-ou ‘ripe banana’, naw-ou ‘reddish sago’. (These words exhibit the
pitch pattern that is distinctive for compound nouns, §3.2.2.) Other colour
terms are formed with the help of the NP marker eyn ‘similar’, e.g.
woukmow-si eyn ‘similar to the excrement of a dove’ (= greenish) or
wouknow-hu eyn ‘similar to the juice of ginger (= yellowish)’. The origin
of weys ‘white’ is not really known. It can be used in compound nouns
ohi-weys ‘skin-white (= white person)’ or pekney-weys ‘spotless entitywhite (= pristine white)’.
Many concepts which are expressed by adjectives in English are
expressed in Abau by a combination of a noun and a verb or a noun with
the comitative marker non, as illustrated in (65):
(65) Hiykwe
iha lopa.
3S.M-TOP hand NEG
‘He has no hands (= he is stingy).’

‘He is with sickness (= he is sick).’
Hiykwe
omeme ihey-ar

3S.M-TOP things excellent-INTF CMT
‘He is with very good things (= he is rich).’3.5.2 Similarity in distribution of the intensifier and
restrictive marker within the NP
Nouns and adjectives are both structurally distinct from verbs as they
cannot be affixed by any of the verbal affixes listed in §4.2.1, Table 33.
Structurally nouns are not different from modifiers. Both host similar
affixes like -ar ‘intensifier’ and -aw ‘restrictive’. See examples (20) and
(21).
These markers can also be used with adjectives, as is illustrated
below.
In (66), the intensifier -ar is affixed to a temporal noun paraw and the
adjective ihey (which is part of a NP).

The following morphophonemic rules are optional. They are
frequently applied but not obligatory. Both base forms and
morphophonemically derived forms exist side by side. The two optional
rules are:
Rule C: o o e / __Ce#
Rule D: o o a / __Ca# (in which C=consonant)
(8) none ‘nose’ is used interchangeably with nene
kora ‘direct speech, addressive’ is used interchangeably with
kara
hrome ‘1PL.OBJ’ is used interchangeably with hreme
In (8), hrome is derived from hrom ‘1PL.SUB’. It can take the genitive
suffix -o, or the objective suffix -e. When suffixed with the front vowel -e
the optional vowel harmony Rule C can change hrome into hreme.
Table 10 shows the application of morphophonemic Rule C. The last
column shows the base forms and the second-last column shows the
morphophonemically derived forms.

"315In (30) above, the tail position is used for a participant that has been
introduced already and can be deduced from the context. The speaker
nevertheless adds the participant in the tail of the predication to rule out
any confusion.
Example (33) illustrates a similar point. One can delete the tail
without causing the sentence to be grammatically incorrect. The semantic
domain of the verb lwawk ‘step into’ anticipates an object that has sides.
This verb is frequently used with the noun yeyk ‘canoe’. In spite of the
fact that the listener can be expected to supply the location yeyk ‘canoe’,
the speaker still adds the information to rule out confusion.

In (34), a temporal NP occurs in the tail position. It is different from
example (33), where the information in the tail completes the thought
expressed in the main clause. In (34), the tail contains additional
information. Its absence would not lead to miscommunication, since the
main information preceding the P3 constituent is complete in itself. By
placing the additional information in the tail, the speaker keeps the central
information in the main clause concise and together.

It is relatively rare for the tail position not to be topicalised. The
pragmatic topic marker consigns background status to the topicalised316constituent. If the tail occurs without a topic marker, the status of the
constituent changes and it starts to have the capacity to mark new
information. Compare the following two examples:
Example (35) is part of a dialogue between two sisters. The tail could
have been deleted, as the listener only needed to keep track of two
participants.

In (36), the NP in tail position is not topic-marked and should
therefore not be treated as background information. Without the
information expressed in the tail, the listener could not have deduced with
certainty the identity of the recipient that kow ‘benefactive’ anticipated.

Although rare, a subordinate clause can be placed in tail position.
These clauses contain given information or information that can be easily317accessed by deduction. These clauses can be deleted without affecting the
grammatical correctness or intonation of the main clause.
The following two examples have been taken from the story “The two
brothers” (§11.1.1). In (37), a subordinate clause with ankin is placed in
tail position. As the context of the story is the shooting of over-flying
birds, the contents of the clause in P3 position can be deduced by the
listener.

‘Man, you should only shoot your very best, when a bird flies
near.’
A noun phrase that contains a relative clause can also occur in tail
position. In (38), the relative clause (bolded) modifies the head of the
noun phrase now ‘tree’.
(38) Hom wueir se

garden middle LOC RCM stand 3S.M-OBJ
‘When they arrived in the garden, the younger brother
consequently showed the older brother - the large tree
standing in the middle of the garden.’318Examples (37) and (39) are taken from the same story about two bird
hunters. In (39), the NP in tail position ahney senkin senkin ‘all kinds of
birds’ is modified by the bolded relative clause. The P3 constituent (as all
P3 constituents) can be deleted without loss of grammatical correctness.
The object noun phrase in the P3 slot is not present in the main clause.
However, the referent ahney ‘birds’ is signalled in the main clause by
huon ‘OBJ moves to SUB’. The listener can deduce the arrival of the birds
from the context, but the added tail constituent completes the information
and rules out ambiguity.

Instead of occurring as clauses embedded in the main clause, cause
and reason clauses are often extraposed from the main clause to P3, the
tail position in the sentence.
These cause and reason constructions are primarily encoded by
clauses that look like headless relative clauses (see §6.6.3). The tail
constituents are terminated by a demonstrative marked for either subject
or object. A subject demonstrative in final P3 position indicates cause, an
object demonstrative indicates reason. Both reason and cause P3
constructions are preceded by an adverbial causal demonstrative in the
main clause.
These reason and cause clauses in the tail position have the following
features:319a. The normal relative clause features: no internal topic marking on
any of the constituents; the use of the relativiser ma preceding the
verb phrase.
b. Tail final marking consists of a demonstrative marker that is
either marked for subject (cause) or object (reason).
c. The tail construction makes the goal or cause explicit that the
adverbial causal demonstrative (§4.4.3) in the main clause already
referred to.
In (40), the P3-final demonstrative marker sokwe signals object and
therefore the tail functions as a reason clause. The main clause contains the
adverbial causal demonstrative sokwe which expresses a causal relationship
between this main clause and what went before in the previous sentence, or
wider previous context. By adding the optional P3 constituent, the speaker
makes the reason for the laughter explicit.

‘So the crayfish laughed at the turtle, because she had rolled

The only difference between (40) and (41) is the final marking on the
P3 constituent. In (41), the clause-final demonstrative sohok signals
subject, and therefore the tail functions as a causal clause. The difference
is reflected in the alternative translation of these two examples. Like in
(40), the tail position is only added to avoid ambiguity, not to give totally
new information.","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333]"
"1.4 Dialects
The Abau people recognise only general speech differences between
some villages and have no names of dialect areas. On the basis of the
sociolinguistic survey by Bill Martin (1980) the language group was
divided into three dialects. My wife and I carried out a second survey in
1984. It basically confirmed Martin’s findings to divide the Abau
Language in three dialects: Up-River, Central and Down-River dialect. It
was noted, however, that differences within the Down-River dialect
needed to be looked at. Six villages belong to this group and it was
observed that speakers of the three most eastern villages (Beimaf, Senou
and Wagu) had far more difficulties communicating with speakers of the
Central Dialect than the speakers of the other three Down-River dialect
villages (Baiwai, Bifro and Baio).
In 1993, another small survey was done to compare the central dialect
with the six villages of the Down-River Dialect. (Through circumstances
it was not possible to survey Senou, the village that is located between
Beimaf and Wagu.)
It is obvious that a language survey done in an unknown language
yields less precise results than a survey done after a number of years of
language research, since the surveyor has a better grasp of the phonetics
of the language and the ability to avoid incorrect glosses due to
miscommunication. We found that it was misleading to exclusively rely
on cognate figures. For example, the central dialect village Yabru shares a
cognate percentage of 97% with Wagu, the most eastern village of the
language group. This high cognate figure suggests good mutual
intelligibility which is, however, not the case.",[17]
"394In text types where opinion or persuasive argumentation are central,
the speaker will make use of hortative commands and hypothetical
questions to mark paragraph boundaries and even episode boundaries.
Some connectives and conjunctions are very useful in building up
propositions that will support a certain premise or opinion. Examples
include:
x Frequent use of inclusive devices. E.g. the use of hromkwe ‘we’;
or the connective seyr ‘and also’ that joins constituents of equal
status. (Can be used to add support or further evidence for one’s
premise.)
x Frequent use of devices that express real or hypothetical
conditions or alternatives, e.g. conditional clauses marked by
ankin ‘if’; positing of hypothetical questions that will support the
main idea.
x Frequent use of devices that express reason or logical
consequences. E.g. conjunction payhokuaw ‘why, because’; the
adverbial demonstratives sehe, sokwe and seme, to establish
logical consequence.
x Frequent use of hortatory statements (let’s …) or value statements
(this is good/bad).
Examples (17-20) are consecutive sentences taken from a speech to
encourage better maintenance of the village clinic. The first sentence in
(17) is a value statement about the presence of the Aid Post. This is the
supposition that the speaker will build on.
