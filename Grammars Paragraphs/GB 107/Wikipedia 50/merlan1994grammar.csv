Paragraph,Page number
"Thus nganayu may be a negative response to a predication, often as above a proposal,
and may be taken to express 'let it be' concerning what is predicated. The person ""not
liking"" is assumed to be the speaker, unless otherwise indicated. There is an explicit
means for placing person in relation to this form, by means of the dative pronoun series:
nganayu nganu Ί don't like it', nganayu yinggi 'you don't like it', nganayu wurrugu
'they don't like it', and so forth. It is possible to form a complement in which the person
""not liking"" is also the agent of the action, with particle or nominalized verb form and
the case suffix -warr:
(842)nganayu
let it benganu
ISO-DATya-yi-warr
go-NOM-ALL'I don't want to go'.
If, however, another person is agent of the action, a negative irrealis verb form is used
in a distinct clause:Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 327(843) nganayu
wonggo
ya-yi-0-nyja
let it be
neg
IRR-3-3SG-go
'No, he mayn't go' = Ί don't want him to go'.
12.5.6. Gala-warda 'who knows? I don't know'
The particle gala 'try' (12.2.3.) expresses uncertainty concerning an as-yet unrealized
event, with different modulations of intentionality depending upon the ""basic""
paradigmatic form of the predicate. It was illustrated in examples (734) and (735) that
the particle suffixed with indefinite -warda (7.5.8.) is used as response meaning ""it's
uncertain"", or ""I don't know"". It may be clearly interjectional in that such a response
may stand on its own, in relation of course to a previous conversational turn.
12.5.7. Ngala, emphatic confirmation
The conjunction ngala (12.3.3.) signals a break in relation to previous text. It may be
either strongly adversative, equivalent to English ""but""; or less strongly so, and often
understood as a topic-changing ""but what about?"".
There is a further interjectional use of ngala, as emphatic confirmation in response to
a question. In the instances attested the polarity of such questions has been positive, as
in the following exchange in which a woman speaker was recounting the taking away of
her sister's child by a welfare officer to the writer and another woman, B:
(844) A:wurr-gelewu-rri
3NSG-send-PST

and how
""They've sent my child north!"" she said.'
'Did she cry for him?'
'And howlTYes indeed!'","[350, 351]"
"8.9. Irrealis categories of the verb
As noted in 8.2., Irrealis mood marking co-occurs with Present and Past tense suffixation,
and also with zero-stem forms. For those verbs which have a distinctive Future stem,
this is the zero-stem form that occurs with Irrealis.
It is also important to clarify the relation of negative forms of the verb to Irrealis.
Negations of Indicative predications are not Irrealis. Negatives such as ""I did not go"", ""I
am not going"" etc., are inflectionally the same as the corresponding Indicative forms,
negated either with negative particle wonggo or (less frequently) warna (see 12.2.5.).
However, certain kinds of negations are typically Irrealis. With Present-suffixation and
negative particle, Irrealis forms express meanings including prohibition and constraint
""may not, cannot, not able to"", etc. With Past-suffixation, negative Irrealis forms express
counterfactual meanings, ""would not have, ought not to have"", and the like. All of these
inflectional possibilities with Irrealis are exemplified.
8.9.1. Admonitive (zero-stem) irrealis constructions
All examples immediately following have at least one instance of Irrealis-marked zerostem form. This is generally used, as the examples show, to express something which
might happen, the usual (but not invariable) implication being that the event or action so
designated is undesirable and ought to be avoided, whether or not this is explicitly stated.",[208]
"300 Chapter 12Yilama must either have a clause within its scope, or as in (743) imply the existence of
a clause; it does not function as an interjection.
12.2.5. Negative particles wonggo and warna
There are two negative particles wonggo and warna, which do not appear to differ in
possibilities of syntactic distribution, but do differ in relative frequency. Of the two,
wonggo is the most common in the speech of all from whom lengthy texts have been
collected, with the exception of one person whose texts tend either to have approximately
equal numbers of these particles, or a slight preponderance of warna. However, since
this person was a minor contributor to the text collection overall, it is difficult to know
what to make of his case. People from whom the greatest amounts of material were
collected, including notably Elsie Raymond, her father, and Lily Gin.gina, used both
particles, but showed a disproportion ranging as high as ten to one in any given text in
favour of wonggo, but in some texts (those with the lowest number of negated clauses)
occurring in equal proportions.
Both are clausal negators, and generally occur immediately preceding a finite verb, or
before particle plus finite verb combination, or sometimes in between particle and finite
verb (see below). Both may negate verbless predications, i.e. those in which the
predicative constituent is a nominal (including pronoun), and the 'missing verb' to be
understood as a copular one of being. Negations of existence of something in a place
are generally made with -wagbawun suffixed to a nominal (5.3.2.). Although warna is
overall less frequent and both negators may occur in all possible syntactic contexts, there
nevertheless appears to be a slight preference for warna to be more frequent in verbless
(zero copula) construction type rather than as negator of overt, finite predications,
compared to the frequencies of wonggo in these two different contexts. This suggests
there may formerly have been a clearer distributional difference between them, but if so,
it has been eroded.
Both particles may occur with the range of tense-aspect-mood forms, i.e., with present,
past, ordinary future, and potential. Because of the particular meaning of the
'admonitive' category, designating an as-yet unrealized situation as unwelcome (e.g.,
""lest he get sick""), the negative particles are not found, or at least have not been found
in material collected, in that construction type.
As discussed in 8.9.2., functional negative imperatives are not distinct from negated,
irrealis present forms of the verb, thus irrealis yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you (SG) may make it'
and negative imperative wonggo yi-ni-marn-bu-n 'you ought not/cannot make it', also
functionally an imperative ""do not make it!"". A basic distinction exists between negative
predications which negate a predicate of indicative mood, versus those which negate a
predicate of irrealis mood. For the present tense, the difference may be illustrated by the
contrast between wonggo (or warna) nganja Ί am not going', the negative of the
indicative form nganja Ί am going' (this instant, or imminently), versus wonggoAvama
yi-nganja Ί may not/cannot/ought not go'. All of the glossed non-indicative modalities
are expressed formally with the irrealis markers (i.e., first position prefix/es and
appropriate pronominal adjuncts (see 6.7.3.).","[323, 324]"

"Clausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 301The same contrast may exist in the past, between negated indicative forms (""did not

while modality is signalled by the (indicative or irrealis) form of the predicate. Examples
of the negative particles — first wonggo, then wama — follow with commentary.

"In short, whatever the function of the alternation may have been historically, it seems
not to be associable with a difference between grammatical categories now. Any
supposed levelling of a previous grammatical difference may have to do with the wide
distribution of the -ba ~ -ma verb class in the contemporary lexicon, where the suffix is
re-interpreted as a mark of predicate function per se, and not of contrast within the system
of verbal categories.
11.1.3. Negative imperative particle constructions
Positive imperatives are not ordinarily formed using the particle alone (as is apparently
the case in Wakiman, see Cook 1987:255). Thus, one usually orders someone, notduba
'sit down!' with particle alone, but dubajingi 'sit down!', with particle plus finite verb.
While the particle may occur by itself as imperative, this apparently has the quality of a
truncated or elliptical utterance.
Negative imperatives of particle plus finite verb constructions may be formed as usual,
that is, such constructions are identical to the Present Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms:
(646)wonggo
negduba
sityi-ni-jingi-n

"12.4. Interpersonal and emphatic elements
The small set of elements described under this heading do not fit neatly under any of the
other headings in this chapter. They are even rather diverse among themselves. The
inference should not be made from the heading given here that these are the only elements
that have an ""interpersonal"" dimension (see Halliday and Hasan 1976: 26 who use this
term for the ""social, expressive and conative functions of language""), but rather that these
elements have functions which are more centrally definable in those terms than others.
12.4.1. (Tag) question: Ale
There is a question element ale (see Cook 1987:93 for the form ngale in Wakiman) which
is usually final in relation to what is questioned, and thus usually a ""tag"" question marker.
In general, it follows a statement of some kind, and, in the same speaking ""turn"", directs
the addressee to confirm or deny the correctness of the speaker's statement. However, it
may be used not by the original speaker, but in a different turn, to question whether what
the speaker said is correct, and in this usage it is thus not a ""tag"", but a more independent
question element (see example (828) in 12.5.3.). It may follow a positive or negative
statement, but tends to occur after the former; positive statements followed by request
for confirmation are more common than negative ones. It may be glossed 'is that right?'
or'is that so'?
In the first example below, ale is used text-internally. That is, it is not a request for
confirmation directed by the speaker to another person sitting with us in the immediate320 Chapter 12speech situation at the time the material was recorded, but rather a question directed by
the speaker of the narrated speech situation, a European policeman, to an Aboriginal
woman, the speaker's sister. The story being told to me by the speaker and another
woman, in turns, was about how European policeman used to come check up whether
there were any part-Aboriginal children living in camps, and if there were, they used to
remove them to institutions. A policeman came to check up, and found a part-Aboriginal
child in the speaker's family.

The second example illustrates the use of ale within the immediate speech situation. A
woman narrating a story relating to a place we were visiting was perhaps somewhat
intimidated by the presence of a man she thought might know more than she, and so she
directed confirmatory ale to him throughout her narration.

12.4.2. Bago 'that's it'
A second interpersonal element appears to be similar to ale in that it frequently occurs in
interaction, and constitutes it as a joint effort. But in this case, bago is used to signal that
that which was sought within the speech situation (whether an element of language, word
or the like, or something else) has been found; hence the gloss 'that's it', or perhaps 'this
is it' (and the abbreviation CF ""confirmatory"").","[343, 344]"
"186 Chapters(412) illustrates the Future stem form of the verb ""to go"" in this semantically admonitive
construction, ""lest the sun go down"" or ""before the sun goes down"". Compare (417)
below.
(413) has ""he might burn"" with zero stem (again, ba- 'bum, thirst' has no distinctive
Future stem).
(414) illustrates two different kinds of Irrealis-marked constructions. The first, a
negated Predicate with Present-tense marking, expresses the modal meaning ""you should
not"" (pick up the baby); this kind of form, not distinct from the negative imperative, is
further illustrated below. The second form, mum-trie is a zero stem-form, the clause in
which it occurs expressing the undesirability of the action designated by the Irrealis
predicate.
(415) and (416) further illustrate the semantically admonitive usage of the zero-stem
forms with gi- as auxiliary, and gwi-ngu- as main verbal constituent. In this irrealis
construction, the undergoer is marked as intransitive 2NSG subject (but see e.g., 416).
(412) above illustrated the Future stem form of 'go' (-nyji) in an admonitive clausal
construction. This may be compared with (417) which has an Irrealis Present form, i.e.,
with stem not distinct from the present indicative. Here possibility does not have the
admonitive component that the action predicated is undesirable. But (418) is once again
semantically of the type of (412), and here we find use of the Future stem.

The most common occurrence of Irrealis, Present-suffixed forms is in clauses negated
with particle wonggo, or alternatively warna, and expressing modal meanings of
impossibility, prohibition, or constraint.","[209, 210]"
"12.5. Interjections and related forms
All of the forms described in this section can be used as interjections, that is, as
independent utterances. A small number, however (see ngawun and ngala below) also
occur in other speech functions.
12.5.1. Gayawun 'wait, just a minute'
Etymologically, gayawun may be analyzed as composed of the root gaya 'today, now',
and an adjectival, noun-forming ending -wun (~ -gun, see 9.4.). Literally glossed
according to its etymology, the form means ""relating to today, now"".
This word (which often occurs as gayawun-bi, with article suffix) fills the function of
adverbial ""still, yet, for awhile"", or ""now"" in relation to the clausal time-frame, as in the
following two examples:
(828)nga-gaju-rri

still-ART'She has no pubic [hair], no axillary [hair], let her be yet/for awhile'.
However, the implementation of the adverbial notion of ""still"" within the immediate
speech situation — that is, ""now"" in relation to the moment of speaking — is realized
with gayawun (or gayawun-bi), which here means 'wait!, hang on!', or the like, and may
be used as an interjection.

Yilgbayi 'all right, enough', may be used as nominal quantifier, as adverb, and as
interjection. As quantifier, it occurs in clausal ""absolutive"" case functions:
(831) yllgbayi
enough0-ngu-ndi

full'He ate enough, right full'.
(832)yilgbayi

OKyi-jomogba-rri
2SG-full up-PST'But what about you, are you full?'
'[I'm] OK'.
12.5.3. Yawe 'yes'
The affirmative yawe is used either to answer a question posed by someone else, or (as
also in English) to create a cohesive link within the text of a single speaker, by signalling
that the text is about to proceed. Examples of both kinds follow. In the first, yawe is used
within the text of a single speaker to represent a response in a narrated speech situation.
In this segment of text, narrated by Elsie Raymond, she represents her grandmother as
telling her a story of an early massacre; and herself, as listener many years ago, asking
""Is that right?"", to which her grandmother replies, ""Yes"".

"8.2. Overview of tense-aspect-mood categories
A main contrast within the system of verbal categories is that between Indicative and
Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms. Indicative forms are those in which there is no explicit
qualification of the reality or eventuality of that which is designated by the predicate;
Irrealis forms are those which are overtly so qualified. The distinction must be seen as
one which is tailored to the linguistic categories, however, for not all Indicative forms
designate ""real"" events. They are used rather to make predicate meanings in a way that
involves no explicit qualification of the factuality or eventuality of what the predicate
designates.
The Indicative categories are Present, Past, Future and Potential, each of which is
described and illustrated in a separate section below. Each category is marked by one or
more allomorphs, and the tense-mood-aspect categories in the language overall are highly
regular and show little variation. The Present, Future and Potential forms have non-past
ya- in first position within the inflecting verb in 'third person' forms, i.e., in those where
the sole pronominal adjunct is third person, and in those in which both subject and object
are third persons (see 6.6.). This initial non-past, third person prefix in the non-past
categories contrasts with zero in the same position in the Past forms of the verb, e.g.,
yanggun-bu-n 'he is hitting them', versus wunggun-bu-ndi 'he hit them'.
As a whole, the Indicative mood contrasts with Irrealis mood. Irrealis is directly
signalled by first-position prefix(es) in the verb, in general yayi- for 'third person' forms
(as above), and yi- for non-third person forms. There are also some differences from
Indicative forms in person-marking pronominals (6.6.3. for further details). Irrealis
prefixation may co-occur both with Present and Past tense marking, and further, with a
zero-stem form, i.e., one with no explicit tense-aspect suffixation. Irrealis prefixation
with Present forms of the verb expresses modal meanings of the sort ""ought to"", and with
negative particles (either wonggo or warna, 12.2.5.), meanings 'should not', and 'cannot'
(either inability or physical and/or social constraint). Negative Imperatives in Wardaman
(8.9.2.) are not formally distinguished from such forms. Irrealis prefixation with Past
tense marking expresses past counterfactual meanings ""meant to"", ""ought to have"", and
the like. Irrealis prefixation with zero-stem expresses mere possibility ""may, might"" (and
contrasts with Potential, which expresses eventuality but without qualification of the
reality of the event designated by the predicate). A particular use of the Irrealis zero-stem
forms is in what may be called ""admonitive"" constructions, often best translated by use
of English ""lest"". There will be some illustration in this chapter of all of these forms and
uses, and forward reference to discussion of conditional and other constructions in
following chapters.",[199]
"7.5. Interrogatives
The interrogatives are a morphologically disparate set. They differ in their relative
morphological diversity from some other regional languages in that, for example, neither
the form meaning ""when?"" nor that meaning ""where?"" is related to the form meaning
""what"" (cf. Mangarrayi, Merlan 1982, also Ngalakan in Merlan 1983: 77-79). They tend
to occur in first position in the clause.
7.5.1. 'Who?' yinggiya
'Who?' has the Absolutive iormyinggiya, which serves as the non-zero stem. It may be
number-marked for dual and plural with the usual suffixes, and inflected for any case,
but the most commonly found forms are Absolutive, Ergative and Dative.

8.9.3. Past irrealis
Past tense forms of the verb with Irrealis prefix ation express past counterfactual meanings
""would have, ought to have"", and the like. The most common construction type in which
such forms occur is the past counterfactual conditional one, in which typically both
protasis and apodosis exhibit past irrealis forms. Several examples follow (see also

"10.6. The negated noun phrase
One of the most commonly heard words in Wardaman is ngawun 'nothing, none'. One
man of my acquaintance was in fact called by the nickname ""Ngawun"", because
whenever anybody asked him for anything they could be sure of his answer. However,
ngawun is an interjection. The particle which most commonly negates the noun or noun
phrase is wonggo, or secondarily warna. These always precede that which they negate
(see 12.2.5.).

"4.4. Verb particles and adverbs
What are here called verb particles constitute Wardaman's most interesting and perhaps
most complex class. They can be characterized formally partly by the fact that all can
occur with particle suffix (of shapes -ma ~ -ba, see 3.5.3.). Contra some uses of the term
""particle"", in Wardaman this class can be suffixed with Dative, Allative, Dissociative and
Source case endings to form adclausal complements. Particles functioning participially,
and not immediately in construction with finite verb, can be negated by gay. For the
most part, particles occur in construction with finite verbs to express particular lexical
meanings.
The class of Adverbs cannot, satisfactorily, be entirely distinguished from the preceding
particle class. Adverbs by definition occur in construction with verbs and modify them,
and generally each may occur with a large number of verbs. Particles, on the other hand,
tend to be more restricted in the number of verbs with which each commonly occurs.
That is, there is a greater semantic specificity to many particles which determines the
greater selectivity of their occurrence. In Wardaman, there is no set of formal properties
by which adverbs can be distinguished from members of other word classes. In fact, they
show partial formal overlap with particles in that some can occur with the suffix -ma ~
-ba. For example, the adverb bone meaning 'across' often occurs as borle-ma, and so
may another adverb of similar meaning, malang-ma 'across'. On the other hand, two
adverbs, worroman and lurruja, approximate synonyms which mean 'fast, quickly',60 Chapter 4never occur with the particle suffix, but instead often occur with the article suffix -bi ~ -wi
(worroman-bi, lurruja-wi). However, adverbs may be distinguished from finite verbs in
that they cannot inflect for person or verbal categories, and from particles in that they do
not function as nominals, and are not case-inflected to function as adclausal
complements. Though the grounds for isolating the class thus seem to be largely negative
ones — as ""not verb, not particle"" — there seems to be utility in having precisely such
a residual class.","[83, 84]"
"Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 267However, negative imperatives may be formed with particles alone, without any
nominal arguments, by suffixation of -gay ~ -way to the particle. These are apparently
rather forceful in tone, perhaps equivalent to the German past participial imperative
construction: Aufgestanden! The form is very rare in text material collected. Informants
produced elicitation examples both with and without the particle suffix:
(647)balyagbalyag-gay
touch rdp-PNEGnu-waja
2NSG-leave'No touching, you [NSG] leave him alone'.
Note that the fact that the particle itself cannot be inflected for person means that,
though the addressees in (647) are nonsingular in the finite imperative form ""leave him!"",
number of the addressee is not specified in the particle. The force of the particle negator
appears to be to negate the action designated by the particle as a whole, ""No touching"".
(648)jajay-ma-way
weak-PS-PNEG
'No weakness!' 'Don't be weak!'.","[290, 291]"
"Other aspects of word formation 219This suffix is found used with certain common nouns which designate social categories,
to create kinds of gentilic formations. For example, one of the matrifiliativelytransmitted ngurlu categories (see 1.3.) is goyln 'sugar bag', or 'wild honey'. In the text
Galapin a woman speaks of hjr affiliation with this category, creating with the suffix
under discussion a form meaning ""belonging to/affiliated with honey"", as follows:
(522) yi-guyu-wunba
YI-mother-SOU
yi-goyi-wun
YI-honey-NOMnganu
ISO-DAT
yirntg
1E:CNSG-ABSgoyin
honey-ABSyani-tna
thus-PS'From my mother, I an ι honey, like this
we are honey people'.
Forms with this suffix may be further case- and adverbially-inflected, viz. in the text
Galapin the phrase mad-bar ""a mernde-\vun-barra 'in/by means of the European
mernde-wun) language (madin)', with adverbial suffix -barra (see 5.4.).
There is some indication of the antiquity of this suffix in the language, in the fact, for
example, thatthe 'lacking' suffix wagbawun (5.3.2.) is evidently to be analyzed as wagba,
which by itself means Orphan', or 'trash' (discarded etc.), plus this ending. Also the
adverb and interjection gayanun 'still, yet, wait' etc. (see 9.5.1.) is composed of gaya
'today, now' plus this suffix. Finally, a reasonable argument can be made that the
independent genitive pronoun series contains a suffix which may be historically
identified with the one under discussion here, viz. the relation between 1SG DAT nganu
and 1SG GEN nganinggin, 2SG DAT yinggi and 2SG GEN yinggawun, 3SG DAT gunga
and 3SG GEN gungan.gin, and so on. The fact that many pronouns of the independent
genitive series have final -gin, that is with a high vowel not to be explained in terms of
any synchronic assimilatory process, suggests that in some functions the suffix is quite
old in the language.
Some nominal forms which are not productive derivations, but with final syllable which
may be relatable to this suffix, include: yi/maAvu-bujgun 'wild, undomesticated';
dan.guyugun, nan.guyugun 'this side, that side' etc.; dilygun 'possum'; wu-jarranggun
'pinky finger'; ma-dulgun 'bladder' (cf. dulgin 'urine'); buruwun 'killer, good hunter';
jurdbawun 'index finger' (cf.Jurd-ba, particle 'to indicate'); miyiwun 'dog'; muruwun
'bottle tree'; wangguwarlawun 'eastern' (cf. yiyanggu 'east'); andyi-nimgajamayawun
'last of a litter, runt' (cf. yi-nim^yo 'last-born'). It may even be the case that, historically,
the negative ngawun contains this suffix.
The verb particles found siffixed with -gun were: new-ma 'grab', as new-ma-gun;
gurryu-ma 'dive in', asgurryu -ma-gun; and wabirl 'peel, skin,graze' as wabirl-ma-gun.
Note that there is some proble n identifying this suffix with the nominal adjectival one,
in that following a vowel we would expect the form of the ending to be -wun. It must
therefore be suggested that the ending found with these verb particles cannot be identified
synchronically with the alternating ending, but it may be an historically specialized form
of it, and may in fact be relatable to that found with lege One' to create the
morphologically irregular or isolated form lege-gun Once' (see 7.6.5.). Textual examples
of the suffixed verb particles are:220 Chapter 9(523) wangi

"12.2. Clausal particles
12.2.1. Bajawinyin and marrig
The particle bajawinyin is among the least attested, but has been found to mean something
like 'it's all right that', OK that' followed by clause, often seemingly with the implication292 Chapter 12that there is some adversative sense, e.g., despite that, or nevertheless, something else
must be done. The force might be glossed as slightly adversative ""all right... but"". With
a non-past (irrealis) verb form, it occurs as a particle introducing the apodosis of a
conditional construction (and thus partly overlaps functionally with bujun, see 12.2.2.).
With a past form of the verb, it is attested in a meaning something like 'although', and
thus is conjunctive. Examples are:
(711) bajawinyin
all rightyi-nga-ga-n
IRR-lSG-take-PRESlurle
cryya-yi-0-jingl
IRR-3-3SG-AUX'It's OK if I take him [but] he might cry', 'Even if I take him he may cry'.
(712) bajawinyin
all
rightyi-nga-na-n-ga
IRR-lSG-see-PRES-SUByiyalang
knowyi-nga-marn-bu
IRR-lSG-make'In seeing him I may let him know'.
In (712), the verb of the protasis is formally subordinate, as is common enough in
conditional constructions (see 8.15.). More unusually, the predicates of apodosis in both
(711) and (712) are zero-stem irrealis, a formal type usually associated with admonitive
meaning (8.9.1.), i.e., the clause as a whole expressing an unwanted consequence which
is to be avoided. Here, however, zero-stem forms simply express a possible consequence
of realization of the protasis.
An example of bajawinyin with past predicate was the following:
(713) wonggo

nga-jingi-ndi
mugurn
1SG-AUX-PST liengawun
noyi-mum-bi
YI-eye-ARTΊ didn't sleep soundly, not at all, only lightly, although/even though I was lying
down'.
The article-suffixed ""eye"" conveys the sense ""eyes open"", or ""only lightly shut"".
A seemingly more ordinary, or at least better-attested, use is:
(714) bajawinyin
ngarr-gurrgba-rri dan-ya

OK
UNPL-sleep-PST here-LOC here-ABL-DF UNPL-go-POT
lurrbu
home
'It's fine we camped here [but] from here we'll go home' [or, Though we
camped here ...'].
It is possible the particle should be analyzed as baja with the ""experiential"" suffix
-wunyin or winyin (see 5.8.).
A semantically partly similar and partly different particle is marrig OK, it's all right
that'. This appears similar in that it is taken to express approval or acceptance of whateverClausal particles, conjunctions and interjections 293is within its scope, but different in that it is not taken to express an adversative nuance
""but"". Examples are:

These and other examples show that marrig typically occurs, clitic-like, immediately
following the first word in the clause, and so apparently has the immediately preceding
element, rather than the entire clause, must centrally within its scope: ""you-OK"", or the
like.
122.2. Bujun 'if, lest'
The clausal particle bujun enters into two types of constructions. First, it may mark the
protasis of a conditional clause, either non-past or past. The protasis of the non-past
conditional clause is commonly constructed either with future or present irrealis tense
form; and if the latter, it is commonly subordinate. Past conditionals are constructed with
past irrealis predicate. Normally, bujun occurs in first position in conditional clauses,
and later in the clause in its second function.
The second function of bujun is to express 'lest' or 'it might be the case that', where
the anticipated outcome is usually unwelcome or negative in some way. In this meaning,
the clause expressing unwelcome outcome may occur relatively independently; that is,
unlike the conditional construction in which two clauses are closely linked both
structurally and semantically, this construction type is realized by a single clause (which
is, of course, cohesive with others, but not necessarily in a close structural relation to any
other as in the conditional one). In this second function, bujun usually follows the
predicate rather than being in first clausal position, but this is not invariably so: it may
(rarely) occur in first position. Examples of both construction types follow.","[315, 316, 317]"

3SG-take-PSTgunya
3SG DISSyi-ngawuyu
YI-wife-ABSmarluga-wunya
old man-DISS'He took the old man's wife away from him'.
There is an interesting, somewhat different usage of Dissociative. The 3SG independent
pronominal form gunya is sometimes found to be used to mark, not the ""person away
from whom"" the predicate action (trajectory, position etc.) is to be understood, but rather
an ""anti-benefactive"" consequence of what is predicated by the verb for a major clausal
participant. In other words, here the Dissociative actually functions somewhat more
directly like an additional element of the predicate, implying that there will be a negative
consequence for a participant of engaging in the verbal activity.",[103]
"1.3. Linguistic type
Wardaman is both prefixing and suffixing. It has relatively complex nominal and verbal
morphology. There are three overt nominal class markers (yi-, ma- and WM-), at least the
first two of which are used to designate fairly unified sets of denotata. Most noun stems
occur only with prefix of one particular class (e.g., yi-biyan 'man, person, Aborigine');
but some may occur with more than one, producing lexical difference (yi-mum 'eye',
wu-mum 'nipple'). As well, there are many nouns which occur without prefix (i.e., with
0- prefix), but with which modifiers (adjectival nouns) may exhibit overt concord.
Number and case are marked by suffixes, and the syntactic case system tends to be
fairly strongly Ergative-Absolutive. However, there is wide use of a clause type with
actor subject (not generally Ergatively-marked if represented by an independent
nominal), and objective complement marked by Dative case. As well, there are various
one-place (fully intransitive) clause types. Overt suffix categories include
Ergative/Instrumental, Dative/ Genitive, local cases Allative, Locative and Ablative, and
the semantically most restricted local category, Originative. In addition, there are two
morphologically composite case categories, historically built on the Dative. The first,
an historical composite of Dative plus Locative, is termed Dissociative, and usually
expresses the meaning ""from"" or ""away from"" of an animate participant, or ""on account
of of a wider range of participant types. The second, historical composite of Dative and
Ablative, expresses a range of notions including source and cause, and is labelled Source.
Participants are obligatorily marked by pronominal prefixes in the verb, and
secondarily by independent pronouns. A maximum of two participants are indicated in
the verb by transitive prefix forms that tend to be portmanteaux, i.e., not neatly
segmentable into parts representing each person/number that enters into the combination.
In the expression of verbal meanings, there is a basic distinction between inflecting
verbs and what I have called free verb ""particles"". It is common in linguistic descriptions
for the word ""particle"" to be used to designate non-inflecting parts of speech. In
Wardaman what I call ""particles"" can take some inflections. The term ""particle"" in this
sense, however, has had currency in Australianist studies for some time (see Dixon ed.
1976), and I retain it, but place emphasis on describing the possibilities of inflection, and
the important syntactic functions of these elements. ""Verb particles"" are semantically
full, and occur in combination with a small number of high-frequency inflecting roots
(including a number of significant ones of shape CV). Where such particle and verb
combinations are highly regular in a specific verbal meaning, the construction is
generally labelled that of Particle plus Auxiliary in this description. However, it isIntroduction 5significant that here, seemingly more than in some other regional languages which have
this general construction type (e.g., Mangarrayi), the ""AUX"" often transparently has
some clear semantic commonality with the particle, and thus cannot be regarded simply
as a formal mechanism or bearer of inflections. For example, with the particle gayardung
'run', most common are the motion verbs ya- 'go' and nyanga- 'come'. These of course
partly function as grammatical ""auxiliaries"", in that they bear person and verbal
categorial inflections; but transparently, they are semantically integral with the particle.
The clear kind of semantic integration in this case contrasts with that, say, between the
particle wululu and its usual ""AUX"" we-, which may occur by itself in the meaning 'fall,
be born'. However, together, the combination wululu we- means 'enter, go inside' (not
""fall in"" or the like). That is, there is no clear semantic ""transparency"" of the AUX in
the latter case, and thus a greater idiomaticity to the combination than to those with
gayardung. Thus, the label Particle plus AUX is applied to combinations which may
differ considerably in their internal semantic relations. The diverse nature of
combinations within this construction type is clearly of comparative interest, and this
labelling should not by any means disguise the fact that, as noted above, ""AUX"" is a
semantically and functionally flexible, diverse and problematic category.
Particles have a wide syntactic range. They may be inflected for nominal categories
(case), and occur in non-predicative construction types as nominals, and as modifiers.
Paradigms of inflecting verbs tend to be highly regular: there is a very limited amount
of suffixal allomorphy for tense/aspect/mood categories. The one thoroughly irregular
paradigm is that of the verb ""to go"".
Suffixal categories of the verb include Present, Past, Future, and Potential, that is,
express tense and in some instances, tense/mood meanings. An Admonitive (""lest"")
construction is generally built on a zero-stem form, or is built on the Future stem in the
few verbs where this is a formally distinct (and obviously historically moribund)
category. Further tense/aspect meanings (e.g., iterative) are expressed by additional
suffixation to verb forms inflected for tense/aspect, and in some instances (Habitual) by
special prefix forms.
A basic mood distinction between Realis and Irrealis categories is expressed by verbal
prefixation, in combination (in some instances) with differences in the bound pronominal
forms which express person/number as between the two mood categories.
Weak subordination of one predication to another is a common means of constructing
discourse linkage in Wardaman. There are two sets of subordinators, one expressing
non-past, the other past, temporal reference. Another important mechanism of textual
cohesion is ""de-focusing"" of overtly occurring NPs, i.e., marking of them as recoverable
and thus cohesive with surrounding linguistic context.
Three deictic ""degrees"" are distinguished in the demonstrative system, with some
irregularity in the paradigms. The spatially intermediate category (not ""this""and not
""yonder"", but proximate ""that"") also serves to indicate textual recoverability, and is thus
most closely comparable to the English definite article.
There are five main points of articulation of parallel stop-nasal series: labial, apicoalveolar, apico-domal or retroflex, lamino-palatal, and velar. There are laterals at three
of these points of articulation, apico-alveolar, apico-domal, and lamino-palatal. The6 Chapter 1lamino-palatal lateral has a very limited distribution. There are retroflex glide and tap
alveolar rhotics. While there are five vowels /, e, u, o and a, the mid-vowels do not
occur in any of the inflectional morphology, except as the result of low-level assimilatory
processes. The mid-vowels do, however, occur in a small number of important
derivational morphemes, and they occur freely in the wider lexicon.
There are no vowel clusters in Wardaman, and no vowel-initial morphemes besides the
tag-question particle ale 'isn't that so?'.
There appears to be little intra-language variation, but minor differences in a few lexical
items were noted among speakers.
Like Warlmanpa to the south (see Nash 1990), Wardaman speak of different territorial
sub-groupings, to which recruitment is normatively in the male line, as having different
madin 'languages', or 'words'. Each such identifiable grouping is said to have
minimally one, sometimes more, special words that are ""their"" language. Typically, these
are said to be either the sound made by, or the language spoken by, principal mythological
figures saliently associated with given Wardaman sub-territories. For example, an
important mythological association with the sub-country just west of Willeroo Station
homestead running westerly to Garnawala (Mount Hogarth) is gulirrida 'peewees',
which are abundantly represented in some of the spectacular rock paintings in this area.
The ""language"" or ""word"" of the peewees, and therefore of the grouping of people
patrifiliated to this area, is said to be mamundajgani, a form for which no etymology can
be given. A few of the ""words"" for particular sub-groupings may have etymologies in
other languages of the Victoria River area. At least one is clearly onomatopoetic (e.g.,
standardization of a bird cry). Knowledge of this kind of relation among people, territory
and salient ""word"" or ""words"" is limited to older people. The madin 'words' about which
there appeared to be wide agreement were: mamundajgani, cited above; ngagandoroj,
the ""word'Of menngen 'white cockatoo', a major dreaming around the Innesvale Station
homestead area; yidabu and wamanga, words associated with warrija 'crocodile'
dreaming, localized at Mt. Gregory; and nenene, a ""word' (imitative of a bird cry) of
bulyan 'eagle', associated with Jalad, or Price's Creek, area. The words associated with
""crocodile"" are interesting, and either have etymologies in other Victoria River
languages, or apparently in any case connote the meanings ""beef, meat"" and ""hit, strike""
(Wardaman deb 'hit, belt' was used to gloss wamanga), both principal elements of the
myth associated with Mt. Gregory, the principal characters of which, Warrura and
Barnangga, fought over a catch of crocodile. In addition, a dilygun 'possum' dreaming
associated with the high country along Mathison Creek is characterized by a particular
style of speaking, with stopped nasal segments similar to the speech of a person trying
to talk with a blocked nose. Thus, possum says dadadi instead of danani 'this one'.
Asked about these ""languages"" or ""words"", people will emphasize that they are all ""one"",
the ""same Wardaman"", that is, are socio-territorial distinctions made by people who share
a common language in the linguist's usual sense.
Among other systems of social relationship, Wardaman people recognize several
(equatable) sets of subsection (or ""eight-class"") terms, but identify only one of these as
""proper"" Wardaman. That set is given in 5.13. They also recognize matrifiliatively
transmitted recruitment to groupings commonly called ngurlu across the Victoria RiverIntroduction 7region. These groupings are not localized. Among my Wardaman informants, most
belonged to one or other of the ngurlu: goyin 'sugarbag', ganben 'flying fox', warrag
'catfish', yiburu 'black rain', and yiwaganga 'rain'. While some of these are specifically
Wardaman words (e.g., goyin), certain of the names (e.g., yiburu) have wider currency
across the region, and cannot be considered only Wardaman.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"Chapter 11
Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements11.1. Introduction: Special properties of particles
Many languages in this region, like Wardaman, have predicate structures of more than
one kind, some of which consist of more than one word. Verbal construction types were
described in 8.1., and the distinction was made between predicate structures consisting
only of finite verb, and those consisting of verbal ""particle"" (following some longstanding Australianist usage, see Dixon ed. 1976) and finite verb. We saw that among
the finite verbs which may occur as predicators by themselves, with full lexical meaning,
are high-frequency verbs (including most of the CV- roots) which also occur widely with
verb particles, to constitute most of the language's verbal lexicon. It was shown that
there is moderate flexibility in alternative pairings of the same particle with different
verbs, and that this kind of alternation, besides making differences in lexical meaning,
also instantiates differences in clause-level transitivity in what was accordingly termed
a ""lexico-syntactic"" manner. This kind of transitivity system is consistent with the fact
that there tends to be a strong coincidence between particular verb and either transitive
or intransitive clause type (e.g., bu-, gi- etc. transitive, jingi- intransitive). However, a
simple dichotomy between transitive and intransitive clauses and/or predicates was
argued to be inappropriate, mainly because of the considerable degree to which verbs
which, as clausal predicates by themselves determine transitive clause structure, with
particles may instantiate the Absolutive-Dative clause type.
Although particle plus verb constructions occur in many other languages of the area,
their range of functions is rather distinctive of the group of presumed congeners including
Wardaman (for Wakiman, see Cook 1987 Chapter 9; the same range of functions is
indicated by the more limited material available for Yangman). Particles in these
languages have at least two major functions: first, they productively occur with finite
verbs to express predicate meanings; and second, case-marked in a number of ways that
will be described in this chapter, they form clausal complements. It is in this second
range of functions that the particle system of Wardaman and congeners is particularly
distinctive, as compared with other regional languages. For example in the languages
immediately to the east (of the Wardaman-Yangman dialect continuum), Mangarrayi and
Alawa, particle plus verb constitutes the usual kind of predicate construction. But the
extent to which particles in those languages may be used in adclausal complement
constructions is very limited, and in particular, there is no parallel to the Allative-marked
complements described in 11.4.3. and 11.7. Though the particle plus verb construction
type of all of these languages is superficially similar, the differences in syntactic
distribution of the particles support the view that we are not dealing with similar syntactic
systems. There appear, also, to be some, much more minor differences between
Wardaman and Wakiman in the way that particles function: in Wardaman they do not262 Chapter 11occur alone, without finite verb, as imperative utterances (Cook 1987: 253). This
difference may be related to some others, e.g., the fact that the 'particle suffix' in
Wardaman (11.1.2.) cannot be clearly associated with aspectual categorial meaning in
the way it apparently can in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 235).
11.1.1. Particle shapes
The particle suffix of shape -ba ~ -ma may be freely suffixed to the majority of particles,
and also to many of what are considered in this description to be ""adverbs"", that is, verbal
modifiers of a more general sort which may occur with a large number of predicates. As
noted in Chapter 4, particles constitute an open word class that cannot be strictly
delimited from adverbs, though it is useful to retain a distinction between them. There
are some particles which appear to contain what is historically the particle suffix, but
which now do not occur without it. For example duba 'sit' was probably dub-ba, and
with degemination normally occurred as duba. The suffix-less form dub, however, is not
used, in contradistinction to most particles of this shape which still have suffixed and
suffix-less alternative forms (e.g.Juba 'be deaf, shut, blocked', and alsojub). There is
also a large number of particles (such as the high-frequency ngorlog-ba 'talk') which
characteristically occur with the particle suffix, and although informants consider them
acceptable as particles without the suffix, elicitation and text material fails to reveal any
spontaneously-produced examples in which they lack the suffix. We may conclude that
there is a long-term tendency for the particle suffix to become lexicalized, and that this
may be especially likely where the particle is paralleled by finite verb of the same shape
(ngorlog-ba-, see comments below in on the historical relationship between particles
and finite verbs).
Excluding those forms which are considered adverbs, i.e., general predicate modifiers
which may occur with a wide range of finite verbs, an examination was made of 460
particles to ascertain their shapes. Of these, 449 were finally tallied (the remaining few
were eliminated for various reasons, e.g., lowaglowa 'play' because of the exceptionality
of the gl cluster, jangjajang 'slurp' because of the apparently special nature of the
reduplicative process, etc.). Many fully reduplicative stems were classified as of the kind
of one of their identifiable segments, e.g., dingding(ma) 'be pretty, attractive, look nice'
was classified as if it were ding, i.e., as a CVS particle; wardagwardag 'shake head no',
as if it were wardag, i.e., as a CVC(C)VC particle. The final 449 fell into categories of
the following shapes in the numbers given (illustrative examples are also given):CVS where S = sonorant, e.g., jin 'blame'
CVCV,e.g., /wr/e'cry'
CVStop, e.g., bag 'break'
CVR/LS/N, e.g., bilyb 'switch', waring Open'
CVC(C)VC, e.g., birdij 'find'

.18Obviously the first six categories are the most significant, and all of the categories
comprise permissible consonant-vowel combinations. But it is of interest to know the
average and also maximum lengths and shape-types of the particles to see, among other
things, how they compare with the shapes of finite verbs to which, in a moderate number
of cases, the particles are synchronically related (e.g., particle and verb of the shape
ngorlog-ba).
In a lexical list of nearly two thousand entries, 150 were finite verbs, 15 (or 16 including
ya- 'go') were CV- roots, 20 CVCV- roots, 18 verbs with inseparable suffix -bu, and 63
with final syllable -ba or -ma. Of these, 26 had stem-initial element of the shape
CVC(C)VC before the -ba ~ -ma suffix, 20 initial element of the shape CVS(onorant),
5 of the shape CVCV, 3 of the shape CVCVCV(C), 2 of the shape CVS(top), 5 of the
shape CVSC where S = sonorant, and one of the shape CVCVR/LG. The proportions
of each type are in keeping with the supposition that these are the result of a long-term
process of verbalization of particles.
Recall that the verbal suffixal paradigms in Wardaman are highly regular, and that it
only in the CV- roots, and the two roots nyanga- 'come' and jingi- 'sit', that the -ndi Past
tense allomorph is found. It is also only among these verbs, and those with final syllables
-bu, -rla, -nyje, -rna, and some of the CVCV- roots, that the Present allomorph -n is found.
All other verbs, and in particular the class ending in -ba ~ -ma, have no overt Present
suffix, and all take the Past allomorph -rri. It was also noted in 8.2. that there is a small
number of verbs which have a distinctive Future stem-form, mainly those which have
stem-final a, including some monomorphemic roots such as nyanga- 'come', but also
including the class ending in ba ~ -ma. These facts, and especially that the minority and
perhaps relic Past tense allomorph (-ndi) is found only among those verbs which are
clearly of long-standing in that word class, suggest that the direction of historical change
in the language has been towards verbalization of particles, with an accompanying
process of levelling of verbal suffixal allomorphy. The fact that the verbs which end in
ba ~ -ma have distinctive Future stem vocalism, however, is suggestive of intrusion into
the developing majority verb class of a much older distinction between (let us posit and
label) Future and Non-Future stem forms realized in a particular way (the contrast
between / and a vocalism) for some verbs, and which seems to have played a part in the
realization of Irrealis versus Indicative mood categories.
11.1.2. Particle suffix -ba ~ -ma
The particle suffix may be freely added to members of this word class which otherwise
end in a consonant, e.g., ban.garrg or ban.garrg-ba 'fall, pitch down, headlong',
bulmarrab or bulmarrab-(b)a 'float', lorn 'peel, strip' and lorn-ma, etc. It may also be264 Chapter 11suffixed to some members of the class here called adverbs, e.g., bone and borle-ma
'across', malang and malang-ma 'cross, across', etc.
There is a no doubt etymologically related suffix -ma in Wakiman, which Cook
(1987: 235) describes as implementing aspectual differences in the particle class (or
""participles"", as he terms them). In fact, there he recognizes four aspectual participial
forms: aspectually ""unmarked"" (with suffix -ma for many members of the class);
Punctual, reduced in some way compared to the ""unmarked"" form, and involving zeroing
of-ma for some participles; Sequential with suffix -wi; and Purposive, which is generally
built on the ""unmarked"" stem form by addition of y-gu. Cook (1987: 232) notes that
participles in Wakiman can occur alone without nominal arguments as imperative
utterances, and it would seem (ibid: 255) that such imperative function generally (or
invariably?) involves use of the aspectually ""Punctual"" forms, and not the ""unmarked""
ones.
In contrast, in Wardaman although the alternation between zero-suffixed and -ba ~ -ma
suffixed particles is ubiquitous, no such clear aspectual difference can be discerned in
the alternation, and indeed no perspicuous grammatical distinction can be associated with
it. One piece of evidence of the difference between Wakiman and Wardaman comes from
the fact that the overtly suffixed particles are freely used in imperative constructions, as
the following examples show:
(632)\vird-ba

AUXyi-nebel-ya

"10.2. Information units, given/new and theme/rheme contrasts
Halliday (1985 and earlier) suggests that two major dimensions of textual organization
in English have to do with ""information"" and ""thematisation"" (see also McGregor 1990
for application of Hallidayan concepts to the Western Australian language Gooniyandi).
Information is concerned wit ι the given/new opposition, and thematisation with the
theme/rheme, or topic/comm:nt, opposition. He further suggests that information
structure is primarily expressed prosodically, while the thematic structure is realised
through constituent order. In the previous section I suggested the importance of
considering constituency and prosody in relation to each other, in order to achieve a
descriptive scheme which delimits phrase structure and ordering possibilities within the
phrase in a meaningful way. For present purposes, I consider the use of prosodically
defined units to be one of the most helpful methodological offerings of the Halliday
framework, mainly because it provides an opening into the study of the interaction
between grammaticality and other levels of the organization of text.
Halliday (1985: 274) observes that an information unit does not correspond exactly to
any unit in the clause grammar, but other things being equal, tends to be coextensive with
one clause, as the ""default"" ccndition in English. Each information unit is realized as a
pitch contour, or TONE, which extends over the whole tone group. Within the tone group,
one foot or syllable carries thi main pitch movement, and the element which has this
feature of tonic prominence is said to carry the information focus. The tonic foot marks
where the 'new' element of information ends. Halliday (1985:277) considers information
that is presented by the speaker as recoverable as ""given"", and that which is presented
as not recoverable to be ""new"".
The Wardaman texts appended to this grammar were realized as sequences of tone units.
Each such unit is identified by number. Many are short and occupy only one line. The
main criterion for identifying ;i tone unit is on the basis that it is bounded by significant
pitch movement, either a rise or a fall. Typically, such a unit is also bounded by short226 Chapter 10pause, but the presence of pause is not in itself defining of a tone group. In some cases
it is ambiguous whether a particular stretch of speech is best identified as two tone units
or as one. This is especially the case where it appears that there may be some pitch
movement at the possible tone unit boundary, but pitch remains relatively constant
(compared to other instances). In other words, questions of identification may arise
because intonational phenomena are perceived as a matter of degree. The temptation to
identify a separate tone unit may be strengthened where there is also pause at such a
possible boundary, but as noted above, pause in itself is not definitional of the tone unit.
As McGregor (1990: 362) notes for Gooniyandi, tone units in Wardaman do not
necessarily correspond to grammatical units, although they do so in particular cases. As
has often been noted for Australian languages (and as in the Moon Dreaming text, above),
a single nominal word may frequently be found on a tone unit of its own, set apart from
other constituents to which it is meaningfully linked. Because nominal and other words
are frequently set off in this way on their own tone unit, a number of such units together
may contain the information that might otherwise be contained within a clause. At the
same time, it may often happen, as Halliday has shown for English, that a tone group will
be equivalent to a clause, as for the Moon Dreaming group ""he speared the kangaroo
with joey"". In the case of smaller constituent units which may comprise part of a clause,
I make the assumption that while whatever set of nominal words occurs on a single tone
unit may comprise (one or more) noun phrases, it is not legitimate to assume that nominal
constituents occurring in different tone groups constitute part of the same particular
phrase (although the same actual forms may occur elsewhere as part of a phrase on a
single tone group). Thus, in the above Moon Dreaming example, mangali 'female' and
wurre-warang cannot be regarded as part of the same noun phrase, even though these
two words might occur together elsewhere within a tone unit and as part of a noun phrase.
That is, I am prepared to use occurrence on a single tone unit as a minimum condition,
necessary but not sufficient, for the identification as a noun phrase of any given set of
nominal words.
Following Grimes (1975) and others, it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction
to be made between more central or primary tone units, and secondary ones (see
McGregor 1990: 364). In such a scheme, the primary unit may be defined by greater
prominence of its salient syllable, and by greater pitch movement over the contour. A
secondary unit, whatever its precise character, may be defined as in association with a
primary one, and generally characterized negatively, by lesser syllable salience and lesser
pitch movement. McGregor (1991: 365) suggests for Gooniyandi that the primary unit
normally contains the propositional nexus: the verbal complex in clauses with verbs.
Further, secondary units normally consist of a single clausal constituent: NP, adverbial,
or other. McGregor goes on to hypothesize the existence of a tonic sentence, defined as
a primary unit in association with one or more optional secondary ones. In information
terms, the secondary unit(s) tend(s) to elaborate the primary one, or otherwise convey
information closely related to that of the primary unit. I have not put this plausible
distinction between primary and secondary units to work in this description, that is, units
in the texts are not identified as primary or secondary. I would only note that the
distinction might be profitably elaborated as a set of typical primary-secondary tone unitIssues in constituency and word order 227nexus types; for example, there is a prosodic relation of dependency between the
(typically short and unelaboraied) tone units containing a ""say"" verb, and the unit(s)
which realize the reported speech which the verb projects.
There follows consideration of the constituency of the noun phrase, and in 10.8. a
summary of noun phrase structire types. This is given together with discussion of normal
ordering within the phrase. While no doubt further meaningful distinctions made by
ordering remain to be discerned, it is suggested that regular meaningful differences in
the presentation of information appear to be associated in some instances with the
difference between the orders: demonstrative determiner followed by nominal, versus
nominal followed by demonstrative determiner (DEM + N versus N + DEM). I will
propose that this difference may be seen as part of the organization of difference between
unmarked and marked Theme types, that is, less or more remarkable organization of what
any particular tone unit or sequence of them is ""about"". A further introductory word may
be useful here about the notion of theme.
Again following Halliday (1935:278-279) in his elaboration of Firthian and Pragueian
notions, thematic structure may be defined as that dimension in which is organized what
a stretch of speech is about. Theme is commonly defined as (1) the point of departure
of what the speaker has to say, or more fully, (2) what the speaker is talking about, the
topic; while Rheme is commonly defined as the completion of this point of departure, or
the comment. Obviously, the £ iven/new contrast may interact closely with the theme/
rheme one, in that, for example, it is possible for something to be presented as either an
expected or unexpected, a givei or not given, point of departure.
Finally, we will need to consider how to approach the question of the presence and
ordering of nominal constituents of clause-level syntactic function, intransitive Subject,
transitive Object, and ergative-marked Agent. It is common enough for such functions
to be marked only on the verb within any given tone unit, that is, for there to be no overt
nominal expression of any given major clause function. Some discussion of lexical
realization of these functions is thus required, because case-marking of them is obviously
dependent upon their occurrence. But beyond that, is it possible to say that an occurring
nominal typically precedes or :bllows the verb of which it is the object? To the extent
that the agent of a transitive verb is realized by a nominal expression, where does this
occur with respect to the verb1; We will see that the ergative-marked agent is the least
frequently occurring of the three syntactic types, and that there is a tendency for all three
to occur preceding the verbal word or words; but that this tendency is apparently strongest
for nouns and noun phrases in intransitive subject function, noticeable but not extreme
for ergative-marked transitive igents, and least noticeable for transitive objects, which
occur both pre- and post-verba ly with more nearly equal frequency.","[249, 250, 251]"

122.6. Gewernima 'gammon'
The particle gewemima appears to exhibit the usual particle suffix -ma, here as in yilama,
inseparable. Where the role of speaker coincides with grammatical subject, as for yilama,
the particle is understood most clearly to express speaker estimation that the action is
make-believe, an act of pretending, or otherwise dubitable; otherwise, the notion of
make-believe is understood to inhere in the predication, as in the following example:
(766) jelmerrin

3NSG-spear-RR-PST-NAR'They got jelmerrin for play, the children pretended to spear each other'.
This particle is translated by ""gammon"", common in the Kriol of this part of the
Northern Territory as a clause-level expression of (mild) disbelief or indication that one
qualifies what one is saying as possibly untrue, or even impossible or unlikely - matter
for disbelief: olabat bin go yestide gamon '[they say] they went yesterday' (but I have
my doubts). Further examples which illustrate the dubitative nuance ofgewernima, i.e.,
one of doubt or disbelief, are:

Halliday and Hasan (1976: 227) give a general definition of the conjunctive function
which is useful to begin our discussion of particular Wardaman conjunctions, as
""specification of the way in which what is to follow is systematically connected to what
has gone before"". They suggest several different semantic kinds of conjunctive relations:
additive, adversative, causal, and temporal. These, too, will be useful for our discussion
of Wardaman, for there are conjunctions which correspond well to the first three
categories. The fourth, however, seems relatively undeveloped in Wardaman, certainly
in comparison to some other Aboriginal languages of the region.
They also propose a distinction between internal and external conjunctive relations, as
those within the thesis or content of what is being said, and the logical relations within
the speech situation, respectively. That is, ""internal"" and ""external"" are defined in
relation to the text (see Halliday and Hasan 1976: 241). This distinction is also useful
for our purposes here, because it suggests a way of characterizing the difference between
the first two conjunctions to be discussed. These are of ""additive"" type, i.e., are different
kinds of the conjunctive ""and"" relation.
12.3.1. Gabarn 'also, farther'
The most general function of gabarri is to signal that another point is being made in
conjunction with a previous one. Its domain of function is thus essentially external, that
is, has to do with the matter of signalling linkage between one point and another of the
text, rather than signalling that a specific element of textual meaning is additional to and
of the same kind as another (for which see 12.3.2.).
Externality and intemality, however, are a bit difficult to distinguish here, in that one
of the commonest contexts in which gabarri is used is to signal linkage of one point to
another in the text, where the typically clause-level structures used to express both points
have a great deal of common wording, and often differ only in such matters as pronominal
adjuncts in one clause and the other. That is, gabarri is often part of a rhetorical strategy
which uses the notion ""further"" or ""also"" not to express a radically different point from
another one, but to express a high degree of similarity between the two points. It is as
if, in English, we were to exhibit a tendency to restrict the usage of ""further"" and ""also""
to such contexts as the following: ""Alex is a nice boy, and further/also Niko is a nice
boy"". On the whole, gabarri is more similar to English ""also"", which may be associated
with a higher degree of similarity of content of such linked points than ""further"", which
by its very etymology suggests some additional and new development of textual content.
Although gabarri is often clause-initial, it need not be. It also may be used in the two
clauses between which linkage is being effected, the first instance thus signalling
anticipatorily that the linkage is being made. Examples of gabarri follow.","[326, 327, 328, 329]"

Although not all of the predicate meanings in these examples can be seen as aspectually
punctual, there are some that seem undoubtedly so, e.g., (642), and with respect to these266 Chapter 11informants seem to not make a distinction between the suffixed and unsuffixed particle

It is difficult to fluently translate the anti-benefactive contribution of gunya above. It
is understood to mean that the finding of the knife was of detriment to the one who is
understood victim, and direct object of the verb ""to stab"". (88), however, differs from
(86) and (87) in that, presumably, any independent Dissociative form could be substituted
there, and the meaning understood in relation to that person-number category. That is,
in (88), the Dissociative is not a third person category interpreted directly as an element
of predicate meaning, as in (86) and (87).
With inanimate and non-human nominals, Dissociative case marks the thing ""on

A final example shows that, where in context a human or animate nominal is clearly
understood as one ""on whose account"" or more generally ""in relation to whom"" the
predicate action is understood, the case-suffix is interpreted accordingly.","[103, 104]"
"4.2. Nominals: Pronouns, nouns, demonstratives, and
interrogatives
""Nominal"" is the cover term used for a broad class of lexical items which can inflect for
case and certain other categories. Within the class of nominals, several sub-classes will
be identified. The syntactic patterning of all sub-classes tends to be Ergative-Absolutive
where there is an object marked on the verb (even if 3SG zero), but occasional instances
are found in text in which transitive agent nominals are not Ergative-marked.
Pronouns are those nominals which refer to speech-situation participants, and some
which can index (emphatically, anaphorically) other nominals. There are many formal
similarities between the independent pronominal stems, and the affixal pronominal forms
obligatorily prefixed to the verb to indicate participant identities.
Demonstrative pronouns are a nominal sub-class which make reference in terms of
graded distance or location categories calibrated primarily in relation to the speech
situation (there are three such degrees marked by Wardaman demonstrative morphology,
and a whole host of formally related terms, ""this side"", ""that side"", etc.). One term in the
three-term spatial system, called Proximate, also serves to indicate textual recoverability.
Its forms are thus far more frequent than are those of the other two demonstrative
categories.
Interrogative pronouns are nominals with which different kinds of questions are
formed: ""what"", ""where"", ""who"". Secondarily, they function in the construction of
negative and indefinite arguments (""nobody"", ""somebody"").
Number words belong to the class of nominals. There are three numbers, lege One',
guyamin 'two', and murrgun 'three'. Beyond that ngawurnen indicates 'many, a large
number'. Number words may function as modifiers, or as noun phrase heads in their own
right.
Finally, there is a large class that will simply be called ""nominals"" in general, but which
comprehends what would be called ""nouns"" and ""adjectives"" in conventional part-of-58 Chapter 4speech terms. In dictionary entries and glosses, for the most part a distinction has been
made between the former (""N"") and the latter (""NADJ"")· This is not because the
distinction can be satisfactorily sustained for all purposes (see below), but because it
partly captures some distributional and functional differences within the class.
Some nominals, the notionally more adjectival ones like ""empty"", ""tough"", ""raw""
""crooked"", ""long"", ""good"" and so on, are more likely to function predicatively than are
what might be called argument nominals such as ""goanna"" (lizard),""woman"", and ""duly
bag"" (string bag). The more adjectival are regularly causativized and inchoativized,
while the argument nominals are not regularly so treated. Here, however, the distinction
is not absolute, for some of them which might be considered towards the attributive end
of a nominal-feature spectrum, and also some which designate persons in terms of agestatuses, for example, are found to be so treated. For example, a noun which typically
occurs as argument, meaning such things as ""plain, flat place"" (as opposed to ""flat"" in
general), may be causativized. A noun such as ""man"" may, also. Finally, the more
adjectival are commonly found in modifying function, while the others are not.
While a degree of distinctiveness thus can be identified between notionally adjectival
and other nominals, in Wardaman as in many other Australian languages (and regional
ones, including Wardaman's putative congeners, see Cook 1987: 88), the formerare not
limited to predicative and modifying functions, but also regularly function as arguments.
In Wardaman, their functioning as arguments is implemented with the help of the overt
nominal class markers which are prefixed to nominals of the adjectival sort, and create
forms the general kind of reference of which is indicated by the class marker, and the
more specific denotation of which is understood in terms of the ""property-like""
designation of the adjectival stem. Such forms may function syntactically as modifiers,
but equally, they may function as arguments in their own right. The difference between
the two different notional types is fluid enough so that stems of the more adjectival kind,
class-prefixed, may come to be regular designators of (kinds of) referents which have
the particular property. For example, the adjectival stem barnbamin means 'naked,
hairless'; with animate class prefix, the formyi-barnbarnin is used to mean 'buffalo'. To
give a second example, the adjectival stem langman means 'clear, cleared'; with class
prefix, the form wu-langman is taken to mean 'clear space, clear area', and case-inflected
forms of it are commonly used without any (other) argument noun, e.g., wu-langma-warr
'to a clearing, clear place' (allative-marked).
Another general difference between notionally ""argument"" and adjectival nominals is
that most of the former tend to regularly occur with only one class prefix (if any, for there
are argument nouns like bangbun 'woman' which never take overt class prefix). For
example, most body parts take the class prefix yi-, and tend to occur only with that prefix,
not with any other. On the other hand, most of the notionally adjectival nominals may
be freely prefixed with the range of class markers, something which changes their
understood designation. There are some indeterminacies here too, however (see 5.1. for
more detail), so relatively fixed versus variable class-marking of nominals can only be
taken as a general guide. The point in distinguishing between N and NADJ at all is not
to saddle the language with untenable distinctions, but rather to try to capture some of
the privilege-of-occurrence tendencies which are evident in Wardaman.","[81, 82]"

Introduction1.1. Wardaman today: The language and its speakers
Wardaman is a non-Pama Nyungan language of the upper, inland Northern Territory of
Australia. It is now one of the most widely spoken Aboriginal languages of Katherine, a
rapidly-growing1 town of about 8000 people located on the Stuart Highway in the upper
third of the Northern Territory (Map 1). Though Wardaman is more widely known than
some of the other languages of the general Katherine area, the number of active speakers
is relatively small. I estimate there are 30 people aged 40 and above who live in and
around Katherine, and regularly speak Wardaman in some of their interactions with each
other. They do not speak only Wardaman to each other and to other Aboriginal people
with whom they live, but also use north Australian Kriol (see Sandefur 1979) and other
Aboriginal languages.
Additionally, there is a much larger number of people — possibly numbering as many
as two hundred — with and around whom those active speakers live, and in many cases,
have lived for a long period of time, who understand Wardaman and consider hearing it
spoken around them a regular feature of their lives. Many of these additional people are
close family of the ""core"" speakers, children, grandchildren, and others. Some others,
however, tend to be more distantly related ""countrymen"" of the Wardaman — people
who identify with tribal groupings of Victoria and Daly Rivers and the larger region west
and south of Katherine, contiguous with what the Wardaman regard as their traditional
territory. These countrymen include people who are identified as Jaminjung, Yangman
and Mudbura, among other tribal groupings. Many of these people have been in the
Katherine area for a long time, and some are married to Wardaman. Additional
countrymen from the Victoria River hinterland, who identify with tribal groupings
including Ngarinyman, Nungali and Ngaliwurru, often visit the Katherine camps and
houses where Wardaman people live when they come in to town. (See Map 2 showing
approximate territorial association of the tribal groupings mentioned). Some of the older
countrymen not only understand Wardaman, but can speak it, even if they do not do so
as often as the Wardaman core speakers.
Younger Wardaman people — in my observation, including at least everyone born after
the Second World War — do not speak the language actively, but use at most the
occasional word and phrase. Varying with family, however, some of these younger
people have a good understanding of the language. Due to the particular circumstances
1. The town had continued to grow steadily but slowly until 1986, when the recommissioning of
a RAAF base east of the town, Tindal. was the impetus for the rapid near-doubling of the town's
population. Under these conditions, and despite considerable Aboriginal movement into the town
in the 1960s. 1970s, and 1980s, there has been diminution of the proportion of the town's people
who are Aborigines.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

Issues in constituency and word order10.1. The question of fn:e word order
As modern description of Ausfalian languages intensified from the early 1970s, it was
commonly said that they exhibited ""free"" word order, both at the level of the phrase and
the clause (Dixon 1972; Sharpe 1972; see also more recently Simpson 1991, Chapter 2,
where ""free word order"" is desc ibed as a defining dimension of ""non-configurationality""
for the Pama-Nyungan language, Warlpiri). The general claim is that constituent wordlevel units can be found in almost any order and the phrase or clause still be grammatically
acceptable. Taken in that baiic sense, Wardaman, too, exhibits greater freedom of
ordering than does English, for example.
Some researchers, however, have reported of their languages that not all orders are
equally common within the pirase or clause (Heath 1984; Merlan 1988; McGregor
1990). They have observed tha: ordering is freer than in English and many of the world's
better-known languages, but ha /e sought to open the question, Free with respect to what?
In other words, they have begun to explore the question whether the grammatical notion
of the ""clause"" is the appropriate basis in terms of which to describe ordering phenomena.
In my opinion, the answer wh ch is beginning to emerge from this work is that other
levels of analysis—for example, intersections between constituent structure possibilities
and their typical prosodically organized syntagmatic realizations — must be the units
against which different word-level orderings, and their differing frequency and
meaningfulness, need to be defined.
We can illustrate from Wardaman examples the difficulties which arise in attempting
to define any particular noun phrase on the basis of constituent structure only, in order
to show how these problems have informed the approach taken further on in this chapter.
Many of the issues involved have been previously noted for their general descriptive
interest. Consider the first few lines of the text (appended) Jalijbang, about a moon
dreaming place on Innesvale Siation.
A protagonist, of Yiwalyarri iubsection, is identified. Then:
(527) yanggi bogogo gangma.i yorri
'He went hunting and sheared a kangaroo'
mangali
'a female'
wurre-warang
'with young/a joey'.
Then the information given to that point is summarized:224 Chapter 10(528) yorri nana gangman wiirre-warang
'He speared the kangaroo with a joey'.
Obviously, in the text as given, line divisions have already been made which appear to
be of some significance. These, as will be described, are tone groups. At first,
information is being conveyed in a manner that may be called ""expansion"": only a small
""bit"" is given in each apparent unit. Then a structurally more elaborate summation is
given, that is, one in which the word-level units can evidently be assumed to comprise a
whole unit (in this case, clause) in a way the preceding shorter units cannot. That clause
contains a nominal constituent structure which is not uncommon in Wardaman,
consisting of a demonstrative determiner, plus nominal plus a nominal modifier of the
""having X"" kind described in 5.3. In fact, as we will see, phrases consisting of the first
two elements — demonstrative plus open-class nominal — are the commonest kind of
two-word noun phrase in Wardaman, and the position of the ""having"" modifier following
the entity is also typical (although such ""having"" constructions may of course occur by
themselves, as the sole word of a noun phrase). The more elaborate phrase shows us a
typical way in which the NP may be realized by a syntagm of words. The preceding
lines, however, cannot be identified as a single NP. One of the main reasons for that must
be taken to be the fact that preceding words do not all occur within a single unit as defined
by prosodic criteria. Semantically, we see that the descriptions ""female"", and ""having
joey"" further specify the reference of ""kangaroo"", for which here the generic term, rather
than any existing, specifically female term, was originally used. A phrase consisting of
an open-class nominal such as ""kangaroo"", and then followed within the same tone unit
by two additional nominal descriptors, would in fact be unusual. It is best to conclude
that in the preceding lines ""kangaroo"", ""female"", and ""having joey"" do not constitute a
phrase, continuous or discontinuous, but together constitute a typical association of
prosodically distinguished units of information.
To even begin to assemble the evidence concerning what may, and what may not,
constitute a ""phrase"", we have to have some criteria of identification. One must, as is
ordinarily done, take into account the possible function or role of given words within a
conceivable grammatical constituent structure; but identification as a phrase cannot be
made ONLY on such grammatical bases, concerning the possible assignment of words to
constituent structure. If that were the only criterion, we might be tempted for example
to regardgangnian mangali wurre-warang as a discontinuous noun phrase, and perhaps
also to attempt permutations of these words in relation to the verb ""speared"", in order to
establish possibilities of ordering within the clause as a whole. Any or all of such
attempted permutations, I feel quite confident, would be accepted by informants as
intelligible. In doing that, however, we would lose sight of the fact that a group such as
gangnian ntangali wurre-warang is at least not usual within a single prosodically defined
unit.
It is common for constituent structure to be defined with respect to attested examples
which show the apparent full range of possibilities of realization. What I am suggesting
here, however, may appear to some to go too far: that is, that what may count as an attested
example of a particular kind must be defined with respect to some apparently significantIssues in constituency and word order 225criteria that belong to other levels of linguistic organization beyond the simply
grammatical. We have noted the common report that, when what is taken as the central
issue is ""grammaticality"", many Australian languages appear to exhibit such freedom in
ordering that the result has often been stated as ""any order is possible"". But that does not
tell us what orderings are morj frequent than others, or distinguish the meaningfulness
of the different orders. And when frequency becomes an issue alongside grammaticality,
then it must also be asked, in what contexts do particular orders occur? Ways must be
found of discriminating different linguistic contexts, and I am simply suggesting that that
cannot be done with respect :o the same phenomenon one is attempting, in the first
instance, to describe — grammatical function within constituency. Rather it must be
done with respect to actual realizations of syntagms which differ meaningfully.
Obviously, like some other Australianists (Heath 1984; McGregor 1990; all of us
following Halliday and others of the Firthian school), I accept that prosodically defined
units appear to be a significant and much under-studied resource for identifying contexts
with respect to which different realizations of constituent structure may be defined.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"
"11.5. Source-marked causal complements
The Source case-suffix is differently distributed in adclausal complements with particles
and nominalized forms of finite verbs. Both Source and Ablative case suffixes are
regularly found with particles, and the semantics of the two are generally but not
completely distinct. With particles, Source usually expresses cause or earlier condition
compared to a subsequent one, and Ablative generally has a somewhat more concrete
sense ""from"" whatever is designated by the particle.
Nominalizations of finite verbs are rarely found Ablative-suffixed. That is, even
nominalized, finite verbs do not become susceptible of suffixation with what, in
Wardaman, remains throughout its range of functions a rather concrete, spatial case form.
Source is common with nominalizations of finite verbs, however, as a formative of causal
complements. As with purposive complement types described above, major arguments
of the complement clause are also Source-suffixed. (688) to (694) illustrate Source

Occasional examples were recorded in which a finite verb form was Source suffixed,
and the case ending could have a fairly concrete sense. This was particularly true of the
Habitual category, which as observed in 8.10. often is used to establish background in
terms of the typical action or conditions, and in this sense is a more stative than active
category of the verb.

As mentioned in 11.5., Ablative case suffixation of nominalized complements derived
from finite verbs is rare. In textual material, Source was found with such complements.
In elicitation, informants sometimes produced an Ablative-suffixed, nominalized
complement, but then almost invariably changed it to Source. However, as also noted,
both Source and Ablative case regularly occur with particles. An example of a sentence
made up by an informant to illustrate the use of Allative-marked gurrg-bi-warr
(/gurrg-ba-yi-warr/) was first given including an Ablative-marked complement using the
same verb:

home'I'm going to go sleep in another camp

later I'll come home from having slept'.
Having said this, the informant then changed gurrg-bi-wa to gurrg-bi-wunba, and it
was notable that this commonly occurred with a number of different informants.
Examples of particles with Source and Ablative were common enough, however, so
that there can be no doubt of the normality of both types. Two examples which were
produced in the course of sentence-by-sentence grammatical work were:
(699)nga-bu-ndi
wumbang-ma
1SG-AUX-PST emerge from water-PSbornbom-ba
bathe-ABLΊ came out of the water, from bathing/washing'.
The informant accepted as fully normal-sounding, and of equivalent meaning, the same
sentence with bornborn-gunba. The Source form is the usual one where the sense of the
particle can be understood as causal:

"254 Chapter 10This example might be seen to illustrate both types of particle cooccurrence
characterized above. First, in the second line there is the combination girdibun-ma which
means 'finish, end' (and as a nominal modifier may mean ""all, the whole lot"") together
with the particle plus verb combination yarr-ma ya- 'to diminish, tail off, end', often used
of seasonal rains. The former particle is more general than the first in that it expresses
completion more broadly, and restricts the following lexical combination, producing a
meaning something like ""when it ended completely, altogether"". In the last line is the
combination bogogo ngurlmud, of the second sort, where one particle cannot be seen as
restricting or modifying the other, because they are of approximately equal lexical
specificity, semantically compatible in that each designates activities defined in
opposition to staying put, being in camp and the like. The result is a more conjunctive
kind of expression: ""foraging and camping out"".

(615) may be considered an instance of the second kind, where there is a relation of
semantic compatibility and partial synonymy between the two particles, lurle used in the
meaning 'cry, weep' and mulerr-ma with connotations of public, loud, grieving and
mourning, particularly for a death. Together the particles encode and reinforce a single
predicate meaning (as opposed to a more clearly conjunctive one of the bogogo ngurlmud
type).

In (616), moyin-ma (which, like some other constructions of sentiment and affect,
occurs with the Absolutive nominal mejern 'stomach', see 10.4.), apparently conveys a
sense of worry or concern, while luyurr-ma designates longing, pining, or sometimes
compassion for. The combination seems to be conjunctive, rather than one particle
restricting the other.
(617)warlarrgu
outsidewud-janga-ndi
3NSG-come-PSTwerrwerr
outwards rdp'They came outside'.
As first briefly mentioned in 7.6.3., in Wardaman as in Wakiman (see Cook 1987:253),
there is a common use of two orientational particles which locate action or state as
""outwards"", ""outside"" and ""inwards, inside"" (but the relational sense, or the relation to
something else, of both terms may sometimes not be very precisely defined or explicitly
indicated). In Wardaman, the most common term that designates 'inside, inwards' isIssues in constituency and word order 255warljub(-a), and this is more adverbial than specifically particle-like, in that it readily
occurs with any number of finite verbs, and is not particularly strongly associated with
any, in anything approximating a regular particle plus finite verb combination. There is,
however, a second particle wululu 'inwards, inside', which while it may combine with
any verb of motion (""come"", ""go"" etc.), tends to occur with special frequency with we-,
which by itself means 'fall'. The combination wululu we-, however, does not mean to
""fall in(side)"", but rather simply 'go inside, motion inwards' wululu ngerr-we-n 'let us
go inside'.
The particle werr-ma Outwards, outside' is often used to describe the situation of
people emerging from the countryside into a camp or habited place, approximately 'they
came out'; it is used to describe where rivers and creeks come ""out"" or debouche; and to
describe the emergence of dreaming figures from the landscape or from a position covert
within landforms into the visible world, or into a particular place. As in (610), this particle
may occur with other forms such as warlarrgu, generally used (now, at least) to talk about
Outside' a house or other structure as opposed to inside, and of such generality that it
might be designated an adverb as easily as a particle. Although werr is also of
considerable generality (i.e., it is used to describe the ""outward"" motion or position of a
large range of arguments), it is more particle- than adverb-like in that it is regularly found
in lexical-syntactic combination with the finite verb bu- to express action or motion
outwards (although it MAY also occur with other verbs). Thus, the coocurrence of
warlarrgu and werr would seemingly be best described semantically as one of a more
general item modifying a more specific one, and together expressing not just emergence
Outwards' (i.e., the inward to outward trajectory of werr), but to the outside (the general
location designated by warlarrgu).
The examples presented so far have been of particles cooccurring within a single clause
on a tone unit, where each particle (or adverb) is associated with the finite verb of the
clause, each in the same way, or one apparently modifying or restricting the other. It
often happens in connected narrative that particles are used without a finite verb but
simply with a major argument of a (partly realized) clause, often the object, as in the
following:

spread rdp'They sliced it, that's all (finished)
the two of them spread the grass out for it
heap up stones, spread out grass'.
Especially given the preceding context, the last tone unit can be easily understood
despite the absence of any finite verb. There are many textual examples elsewhere of a256 Chapter 10tone group consisting of one or two grammatically complete clauses, and then an
""appended"" particle without finite verb, final or near-final within the tone group. The
effect of this kind of ""incomplete"" structure is to indicate that the action, condition etc.
designated by the particle should be interpreted in relation to the rest of the tone group,
and in direct relation to major arguments within it. Insofar as ""ellipsis"" is used to mean
that some constituent formerly present has been zeroed, the term does not seem
appropriate. We seem to be dealing with instances in which the particle SUGGESTS the
fuller verbal expression. The following set of examples should illustrate this common
textual effect:

however, there is no finite verb with dun, but the object of the particle is clearly understood
to be the immediately preceding magulu, and the subject, the 3NSG pronominal on the verb.

and then repeated in the third line, which ends with particle ngay 'mix, stir', and no finite
verb. The following line begins with the finite verb (me- is the usual finite verb with
ngay, while jubung commonly occurs with both bu- and me-), a repetition of ""with

The particle without finite verb occurs in the third line: duyma 'heap' normally occurs

predicate, however, but returns to the theme of shooting and the fact that even little
children were killed.

descend'He got up quickly with a start
ran and descended to the river'.
The first line might be interpreted as a combination of particles of compatible
semantics, gud more general in that it designates arising, getting up, and wardabarrb
more specific in that while it implies arising, it also specifies the manner in which it is
done as sudden, or unexpected. Both gud and wardabarrb normally occur (in
intransitive clauses) with finite verb gaju-. That is, it is probably not appropriate to see
wardabarrb as the particle of a truncated or ellipsed clause, but as the second member
of a particle combination with gud. In the second line, however, we may posit that
yirrgulun judjud are members of an incompletely specified predication ""and descended
to the river"". Indications that this string never achieves clausal status are: first, that
yirrgulun is Absolutive, instead of Allative as one might expect in a fully developed
clause; and secondly, \hatjudjud normally occurs with we- in the meaning 'descend',
and therefore may be interpreted as occurring here without finite verb. The latter point
is somewhat equivocal, for judjud also regularly occurs with the verbs of motion 'go'
and 'come'; however, given the lack of case-marking on 'river', we may interpret this as
a textually-cohesive fragment, rather than as a particle-combination with finite verb να-.
A passage similar in context occurs further on in the same text from which (622) was
drawn:

along the river and came up and out on black soil'.
Here the particlejudjud is once again apparently not directly paired with a finite verb
(though the ""river"", the place to which the subject descended, is regularly case-marked).
The meaning is perfectly clear because of the surrounding specification of the nature and
direction of action.

The particle duba is here without finite verb, normally.//«!»/-, but again its absence does
not impair intelligibility.
Although such unpaired particles commonly occur tone-group finally, as so far
illustrated, they may also occur in other positions, especially group-initially:
(625)wardarl
struggle

3SG-AUX-PST
wardang
belly-upngawun
nothing0-wudba-rri
3SG-AUX-PST'She struggled, nothing [to no avail]
he grabbed and threw her belly-up'.
The particle new 'grab' is unpaired; it usually occurs with me-, and does not occur by
itself in combination with \vudba- (which as independent verb means 'throw', and
obviously retains some ofthat semantic content in its combination with wardang). 'Grab'
in such a construction as this obviously has the same nominal arguments as wardang.
While further above were illustrated kinds of particle combinations which may be seen
as members of a single finite clause, in the immediate preceding examples we have what
should be regarded as particle adjuncts of less than full clausal status to a single clause.
These adjuncts add to the development of text, and are related to the fully specified clause
in a way that presupposes the sharing of major arguments and argument functions by the
particles, and the applicability of other verbal categories (tense-aspect) to the additional
particle as well as to the clause as a whole. These constructions cannot, however, taken
to be serialized ones insofar as ""serialization"" is understood to mean the regular
combination of predicates in determinate lexical meanings. The constructions illustrated
here are textual ones, i.e. not essentially analyzable at the clause level, though they
certainly interact with and are constrained by clause-level structure. The particle
adjunction effects a close textual linkage between the major clausal predicate(s) and the
adjoined one. This packaging of narrative material is most closely comparable to the
inclusion, within a single tone-group, of more than one finite clause. While comparable,
these processes must be distinguished.","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"
"12.5.5. Nganayu 'let it be, no'
The word nganayu consists of Hortative prefix ngana- (8.8.), and the copula root VH-;
thus, literally 'let it be'. It is used in that etymological sense, that is, as predicator:

interjection expressing dislike, disapproval or otherwise negation on the part of the
speaker, and better glossed simply as 'No [I won't]' or 'No [I don't like it]', as in the

"Categories of the finite verb 203However, a bipartite transitive-intransitive division of both clauses and verbs is
unsatisfactory. Let us consider clause types first, and here it becomes apparent that it is
useful to recognize at least three major ones, and at least one minor one.
An intransitive clause may be defined as one with one pronominal verb prefix (Table
16, Type 1). Various kinds of complements may occur in the intransitive clause, none of
which is marked in the verb, e.g., a clause with predicate of motion may have a
Dissociative nominal complement, 0-yanggi gunya ' he went away from him', a location
complement of some kind, and so on.
The canonical transitive clause is one in which there are two pronominal adjuncts, one
of which may be linked to an independent Ergative-marked nominal (that is, if this is
present), while the other represents the direct object category (Type 3). There is a
ditransitive clause type, which only a few predicates may realize, in which the two
pronominal adjuncts represent the semantic agent and the semantic indirect object (Type
4).

Type 2 in Wardaman, i.e., that in which there is one pronominal adjunct to the verb, a
semantic agent, and a Dative (often, semantically benefactive) clausal argument function
which cannot be encoded on the verb, but may be expressed by independent nominal
phrase, commonly a pronominal. If one takes the presence of verbal pronominal prefixes
as definitional, this clause type is to be regarded as intransitive. But if one defines the
clause type in terms of predicate semantics and argument roles, such a clause-type would
better be regarded as two-place, rather than one-place (intransitive) with possible
additional complements. The agent nominal, if present in such clauses, is overwhelmingly Absolutive, although it may occasionally be Ergative-marked
One might also recognize as a distinct sub-type the clause with one pronominal adjunct
which is a semantic agent or experiencer, in which there may be an Instrumental phrase
expressing the semantic cause or source. The archetypal predicate which occurs in this
clause type in Wardaman is ba- 'bum, perish', often with Instrumental niarninggam-yi
'sun'. As with other intransitives, there is an optional purposive (formally Dative)
argument position ""for which"" that may occur with this predicate, e.g., nga-ba-n wiya-wu
'I'm thirsty for water'. But the really distinctive things about this clause type are, first,
the presence of the semantically agentive nominal phrase which cannot be marked on
the verb, but instead is realized as Instrument; and the encoding of the sole semantically
patientive nominal by subject form-class in the verb.
It seems out of keeping with the structural diversity of clause types, then, to simply
recognize a distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses. We may more204 Chapter 8usefully recognize (at least) the types shown in Table 16. Some further minor types may
also be identified on both semantic and formal grounds; e.g., that described in the
preceding paragraph; the mediopassive construction; and as will be seen below, a
construction type might be recognized for which a label ""medioactive"" might be coined,
to handle the case of a some predicate (particle plus verb) phrases which mainly designate
weather conditions.
If it is not useful to recognize a simple bipartite division of clauses, it is also not
completely satisfactory to recognize a bipartite division of verbs, for at least two reasons.
The first is that the transitivity value of finite verbs as sole predicate constituent, and as
member of a particle plus verb construction, may be and often is different. There is a
large number of particle plus verb combinations, in which the finite verbs are the same
ones that generally occur elsewhere as predicates of transitive clauses. With some
particles, however, they do not determine transitive clause structure. For example, the
finite verb gi-, by itself, is transitive, or the predicate basis of transitive clauses. With
the particle mllid 'show', however, it takes only one pronominal adjunct, and any indirect
object, ""person shown to"", is a Dative-marked nominal which cannot be encoded in the
verb; thus its argument structure is of the Absolutive-Dative kind. In combination with
other particles, such as denberr 'hang up, suspend', gi- is the basis of transitive clause
structure.
In the same way the verb root bu- may occur in transitive and other clause types
depending upon its occurrence as sole predicate, versus its particular lexical combination
with given particles. Although bu- as sole verbal constituent is transitive, in the particle
plus verb combinationyMrd^a) bu- 'to show to' it occurs in the Absolutive-Dative clause
type, and any ""person shown to"" must be Dative-marked outside the verb.
The root bu- is particularly common in particle plus verb combinations which designate
weather conditions, and clauses of this kind show no evidence of being structurally
transitive. For example, in clauses with the particle plus verb combinations jurrg(ba)
bu- 'sprinkle, rain lightly', and larrawardba bu- 'to break' (of day), there is no syntactic
indication of transitivity:
(482)galulul ya-0-wudba
toprdp 3-3SG-throwmarlnga
cloud-ABSjurrg-ba
sprinkleya-0-bu-n-ga
3-3SG-AUX-PRES-SUB'Way high up clouds form when it sprinkles'.
There has never been found to be an explicitly agentive nominal which may occur with
this combination, although the ""cognate"" nominal wiyan 'rain', in Absolutive form, may
co-occur.
(483)larraward-ba
break-PSya-0-bu-n
3-3SG-AUX-PRESmaminggani
sun-ABS'The day is breaking'.
The Absolutive form of ""sun"" in propositions with this combination may be taken as
an indication that it is formally intransitive (i.e., one-place). It might, as suggested above,
be useful to recognize this as a distinct predicate class, for bu- otherwise typically occursCategories of the finite verb 205in transitive or Absolutive-Dative clause types. Combinations of bu- with other particles,
such as bag 'break', yield transitive clause structures.
Likewise, the verb na- 'see' is ordinarily transitive (ngawun-da-n Ί see them'), but
occurs in a formally intransitive clause structure with the particle lag(ba), meaning as a
whole 'to dry up, become dessicated'; in this combination, it is partly synonymous with
the combination lag(ba) ngegba- 'to die and dry up', where ngegba- normally, as sole
predicative constituent, occurs in intransitive clause structure.
The second kind of evidence that militates against a strict transitive-intransitive
distinction at the level of the predicate is the fact that one important predicate, yana- 'say,
do' is found used both transitively and intransitively. Clauses with this predicate tend to
be structured transitively first, where there is a jussive complement of ""commanding
that"" (see 477 above), or second, of ""saying to that"" with complement clause not one of
directly reported speech, in which case the person told may be treated as direct object:
(484)ngan-yana-rri
3SG/lSG-say-PSTya-0-nyangi-we
3-3SG-come-FUTyiwarna
nextwiyan
rain'She told me she will come next year'.
Note that this amounts to the possibility of ""indirect"" report, i.e., the report is not framed
as direct speech, but rather as a summary of what was said, or as indirect speech.
Transitive usage of the verb also is common where what is said is a nominal ""cognate
object"" of speech of some kind, and not necessarily a complement clause:
(485) nganburr-yana-rri-ya
3NSG/lSG-say-PST-NARmadin
word-ABS'They gave me knowledge', in the sense 'they imparted information'.
Intransitive usage tends to correspond to the function ""tell to"", ""say to"" or ""relate to"",
where the complement is a clause of reported (direct) speech:
(486) dana-ni-wan
this-ART-DF0-yana-rri
3SG-say-PSTnganu
1SG-DAT""This is the one"", she said to me'.
The same possibility of variable transitivity exists with the particle plus verb
combination yang(ma) bu- 'tell, inform'. Ί informed them' may be either yang
nga-bu-ndi wurrugu or yang ngawun-bu-ndi, and either may have a full linked clause
(either independent or subordinate in form) specifying the content of the report. Textual
examples were recorded in which the particle jurd-(ba) 'show, indicate', which normally
occurs with finite verb bu- in Absolutive-Dative clause-type such that any ""person shown
to"" must be put into Dative case, alternatively occurs with constructionally transitive
yana-, as indicated by the fact that the one to whom something is shown is marked by
object pronominal form in the verb. (For a parallel difference in transitivity of the ""say""
verb in Wakiman, see Cook 1987: 221.)206 Chapter 8Given the evidence presented here of the inadequacy of a bipartite transitiveintransitive distinction at either clause- or predicate-level, we nevertheless capture
something significant about the language by noting that there tends to be congruence
between particular verbs as sole predicative constituent and particular clause types, i.e.,
bu- as sole predicate normally occurs in transitive clauses. Further, predicates which as
sole constituent function transitively also, in combination with particles, commonly
occur in Absolutive-Dative clause structures; but predicates which function intransitively
as sole verbal constituent also tend to function intransitively in combination with
particles.
There is no single process of transitive-intransitive derivation (but see 8.19. on
causatives). Rather the difference between transitive and intransitive predicate meanings
and associated clause structures is generally managed ""lexico-syntactically"", by the
alternation of different finite (auxiliary) verbs with the same particle. Hence, the
difference implemented by such alternation is often not simply a grammatical one relating
to transitivity, but may also involve additional elements of lexical semantics. Below are
listed a number of common alternations of the same particle with different finite verbs,
the difference instantiating the difference between transitive and intransitive clause
structures:

pairings are found As independent predicate gi- means 'put', and jingi- 'sit', but the
latter also has an important copula function (""be, be in a place""), as well as auxiliary
function with particles.
The sense of some of the pairs listed may be more or less transparent. In some cases
the pair corresponds to a difference in transitivity in clause type, but seemingly without
great semantic difference, e.g., mamaj ngen-me-n 'he beckons me', versus mamaj
ya-0-yana nganu 'he beckons to me', or the like.
The difference in pairings with wabirl is that between ""peel"" or ""take the skin off,
versus ""come, peel off, fade, fall off, as one might say of paint on the wall or colour in
clothing.
There are many alternative possible pairings where there is no change in transitivity of
the clause, but rather a semantic difference in the nature of the action predicated. In
Wardaman, this kind of alternation cannot be seen as of formally different kind to the
transitive-intransitive pairings shown above. Some of these alternative pairings give
some insight into verbal lexical semantics. Examples are:

"See 9.3. for the negation of nominalized finite verbs.
11.1.4. Nominal derivation from particles
While in certain ways particles in Wardaman have noun-like properties (viz. their
negation discussed in 11.1.3. above), a derivational process may be applied to many to
create adjectival nominal forms meaning ""possessed of the property designated by the
particle"".
Such nominalization involves the suffixation of -n to the vowel-final particle (in the
instances attested, to the form with particle suffix), and the prefixation of a nominal class
specifier.
There is considerable evidence of -n as nominal suffix in Wardaman and congeners,
not least in the final-syllable system which undergoes reduction before non-zero suffixes
(see 3.1.). There it was shown that occurring finals are not limited to -n, but many also
have vocalic augment (-in, depending on the shape of the root. In any case, final -n is
ubiquitous.
Besides this evidence of the historical significance of-n in the formation of the nominal
lexicon, there is also evidence of its synchronic derivational status. This plays a part in
the derivation of semantically adjectival nominal stems from particles, and also from
verbs with inseparable final suffix -ma ~ -ba. Before turning to examples of this, it is
important to note that there is also widespread evidence of the long-term historical status268 Chapter 11in the language of a nominal suffix with (phonologically) conditioned forms -ban and
-man. This may be described in general as a semantically adjectival nominal suffix. In
some cases it can transparently be seen to designate an entity in terms of ""having the
characteristic property"" or ""performing the characteristic action, noise"" etc., signalled
by a preceding root. This is most transparent in certain onomatopoetic bird and other
names with this suffix: welej-ban 'parrot', jeg-ban 'turkey'; nilng-man 'fmch(es)',
nirriwu-man 'cicada', etc. But the suffix is found in many other nominal stems which
designate properties, characteristics or conditions, where little further insight is possible
into any derivative meaning, e.g., goyog-ban Orphan, person without relatives';
berlerl-man 'kerosene tree'; ngunag-ban 'good smell'; mele-man 'black', to cite just a
few examples. Insofar as any broad semantic specification of this nominal suffix is
possible, it may be identified as generally adjectival and largely found as an element of
stems which designate inherent properties and characteristics (though, as noted above,
many of these stems are argument nouns in their typical syntactic distributions). In its
designating inherent characteristics the suffix contrasts with a nominal derivational suffix
-gujban ~ -wujban, which productively derives many, predominantly agentive, adjectival
stems from verb particles and from finite verb stems; e.g., a derivate of the particle jilig(ba) 'wake, awaken' is jiligjilig-(g)ujban 'awakening fellow, one who goes around
waking [people] up'. (See further 9.3., 11.3.1.)
In summary, the nominal suffix -ban —man is old, may be etymologically related to
the particle suffix -ba ~ -ma, and obviously has had a large role in shaping the current
inventory of nominal forms. Some of these, like the onomatopoetic animal names, are
associable with an adjectival derivational semantic, but there are many nominals with
this suffix that function as typical argument nouns, and afford no additional insight into
the suffixal semantics. This nominal suffix can be linked to the particle suffix if it is
assumed that there is a final nominal suffix -n, which is pervasive in the system of nominal
final syllables more generally (3.1.).
Examples of the derivational relation of adjectival nominals to verb particles and finite
-ba ~ -ma verbs follow. Any particle stem ending in b is followed by particle suffix of
the form -ba, but such geminate clusters are generally reduced (3.3.), and therefore only
one stop will be written, e.g., /barlbarlb-ba/ will be written barlbarlb-a. Since the
majority of derivations are from panicles, only the finite verb base forms will be
specifically identified as such; all other forms in the left-hand column are particles.

and jajayman 'weak one, person'). Other forms are not as obviously predictable: the
particle bilyb designates the action of swishing leaves as part of traditional curing, and
the derivative bilybilyban 'devil dog' is alleged to have certain medicinal and sorceryrelated powers. Similarly, gerrej-ba 'fly away' has derivative gerrej-ban, which usually
occurs as modifier in the nominal phrase mernden gerrej-ban (mernden = 'ghost, spirit',
also 'white person'); this being is characterized by taking flight, often leaving its
footprints as signs of its passage on the ground. The particle nyilirr-ma is especially used
of someone who ignores or does not listen to others; nyilirrman is someone who acts
superior to others, refusing to heed them (Kriol ""flash""). The particle gelegele-(ma) is
used to describe spearing or firing right past a target without hitting it, as in:

"The reflexive-reciprocal is used to express action where subject and object are identical,
including action upon oneself, and in this is similar to certain uses of the English
reflexive-reciprocal category. However, typically action of certain (largely negatively
evaluated?) kinds, such as fighting and swearing, are formulated with use of an ordinary
predicate made reflexive-reciprocal. Thus, for example, the typical way of saying that
people are fighting is to say, ya-wurr-bu-yi-n, literally 'they are hitting each other'. A
further example of this kind is the formally reflexive-reciprocal verb nge-yi- 'argue',
from transitive nge- 'call'. It seems that the meanings of these verbs should not be taken
too literally (e.g., as ""hit each other"", ""call each other""), but should rather be seen as a
kind of grammatical metaphor, or a typical way of formulating certain kinds of action.
The sentence ngamanda-wunya ya-wurr-nge-yi-n is approximately the equivalent of
English ""What are they arguing about?"", rather than the more literal ""What are they
calling each other (for)?"" A few textual examples of the reflexive-reciprocal category
follow:

"10.9. Variant ordering in DEM + N phrases
In 10.3 it was said that the most common ordering of demonstrative and specified noun
is DEM + N. It was also noted that such phrases containing the forms of the Proximate
demonstrative nana are of particularly high frequency, since that category has the
function of signaling the textual recoverability of the entity, and is perhaps most
comparable to the English definite article (see 7.2. for illustration). But recoverability in
general does not completely coincide with the identification in context of which
particular recoverable entity is being referred to. Let us consider some instances of the
variant order with the Proximate category, N + DEM, since it would appear to be
associated with and one of the means of clarifying which recoverable or given noun
phrase within the information unit is meant, by signalling a break in the flow.
In certain instances where two protagonists have been spoken about, the variant order
seems to be associated with a shift from one to the other.
In the Onion text, line 65 we have an instance of marluga nana. Two men have been
discussing the illness of one of them who ate food prepared by two girls. The other man
suggests to him that he has been ensorcelled, and he agrees. ""I dreamt about them"" (63),
""about the two of them giving me onion, he says"" (64). At that point the other old man
calls out to the girls and tells them to rub the victim with fat. It is at that point in line
(65) that the phrase in question occurs, and appears to be associated with a transition
from the speaker quoting the victim, to the other old man asserting his authority over the
girls and telling them to cure him. Note that the ""other"" old man re-introduced at this
point is grammatically the subject of an intransitive verb (""call to"") which takes dative
complement.
In the text Mejern, between lines (93) and (98) there is a similar shift in transition
between two recoverable characters. An old Aboriginal man identified as the father of246 Chapter 10Micky Bennett was hiding along the river (92) and saw a white man shooting Aborigines
(93). For several dozen lines the speaker has been talking about shooting by whites, not
individually identifiable but only known as associated with local stations. A chief interest
of this part of the story is the identifiability of particular Aborigines and their exploits in
the face of European violence. Having seen the white (or whites) shooting (93), the old
Aboriginal man spears his horse out from under him (94-97), and he falls. Line (98)
begins with the variant order memden nana, perhaps associated with the transition from
the previous few lines in which the old Aboriginal man is the assumed agent (ellipsed in
97). A similar shift occurs between about lines (99) and (104). In (99), the old Aborigine
runs up to the white and stabs him, ""with a tommyhawk"" (100), ""stab"" (101), and runs
away up on top (of the hills) (102-103). Line 104 says: mernden nana gud gajurri 'the
white man stood up'. That is, both are recoverable as nana signals, but I hypothesize that
the variant order may be associated with the signalling of a shift among recoverable items,
specifically to one that has receded slightly into the narrative background.","[269, 270]"
"Demonstratives, interrogatives and adverbs 157Ordinarily the form is as given, exhibiting a suffix which may be identified with the
usual verb particle suffix -ba —nva. Without this, and suffixed with nominal derivational
suffix -wari (see 12.2.), there is a resulting form which also means ""what kind? what
sort? what manner of thing?"", and from this general sense, may also be understood in
context to mean ""what colour?"".

7.5.6. Emphatic (question) suffix -gula
In this and the following two sub-sections three suffixes are discussed which occur with
interrogative expressions and contribute different sorts of modal flavourings. The first
of these, -gula, appears to be the most emphatic and demanding of response (and/or
agreement), perhaps equivalent in feeling-tone to a loudly-spoken ""that's right?"". Its
emphatic character is indicated by the fact that it is one of the few words in the language
which is often followed by phonetic glottal stop — another is the question tag ale
(12.4.1.). Its distribution, however, distinguishes it from the latter, in that -gula as
recorded generally has a single (nominal) element or phrase within its scope and not an
entire proposition, as ale may. -gula is also phrase-final, and not followed by any
grammatical suffix; in this it differs from another question suffix -gan, discussed in the
next section.
Examples of -gula are:

Categories of the finite verb, and the verb in the clause8.1. Introduction: Verbal construction types
There are two common types of verbal construction in Wardaman. One has as its main
constituent a finite verb which by itself expresses the lexical verbal content of the clause.
It carries pronominal adjuncts in keeping with the transitivity structure of the clause
which the verb partly instantiates, and marking for a number of verbal categories
including tense-mood-aspect, and possibly others such as subordination. Finite verbs
may be divided into a number of different formal types, based on shape and analyzability
(see following).
The second kind of construction is one which consists of a verb particle and inflecting
verb. The verb particle, an interesting, multi-functional part of speech, is the basis of
formation of a number of types of adclausal complements (see 11.4.). But for the moment
we will consider it only as part of the verbal construction. In such particle+ finite verb
structures, often most of the lexical verbal content of the clause is associated with the
particle, while the lexical contribution of the finite verb may vary. We might think of the
possible internal relation of particle and finite verb as a spectrum, with variation along
it in terms of the semantic specificity versus generality of the verb. Where the verb is
highly general, it may seemingly contribute only to specification of the transitivity of the
clause, but very little to lexical meaning. Where the verb is semantically more specific
and transparent in combination with the particle, it contributes both to the specification
of transitivity in the clause, and to lexical meaning in a more readily analyzable way.
Most particles tend to be fairly specialized in their co-occurrence, that is, they occur
with only one or a small number of inflecting verbs. But combinations tend to differ in
the extent to which the meaning contributions of particle and verb can be assessed. An
example is birdij, which in material recorded has been found with only two inflecting
verbs. Its combination with the CV- root gi-, yields the meaning 'find, locate'. In
construction with the CV- root na-, it means 'to espy, to find' (as, in the terms of
Australian Aboriginal child-spirit concepts, a father or other relative is said to ""find"" a
child, see Merlan 1986). Such examples present themselves more or less as idioms with
respect to given meanings, in that the contribution to meaning cannot be neatly
apportioned as between particle and finite verb. But such combinations have some
degree of semantic transparency that can be assessed by looking at the meaning the finite
verb may have as sole constituent of a verb phrase, and by comparing the various pairings
of the particle with other finite verbs.
Most of the finite verbs that occur in such combinations as birdij gi- can occur by
themselves as the main constituent in verbal constructions of the first type discussed
above; and from their occurrence there, an independent lexical meaning can be
established. By itself, the verb gi- means 'to put'; and na- 'to see'. We can therefore172 Chaptersappreciate that with respect to the combination birdij gi-, the second combination birdij
na- may be analyzed as 'finding by seeing', or the like. But there seems to be no revealing
way to further analyze the relationship between birdij and gi- in semantic terms.
In other cases of limited co-occurrence of particle with finite verbs, we may speak more
confidently of the semantic contribution and relation to each other of the constituents.
For instance, the particle gayardung 'run' may occur with verbs of motion ya- 'go' and
nyanga- 'come', but we are able to say that the particle expresses a manner of movement,
while the finite verbs differ in directionality.
It is not usual for a particle to commonly occur with more than several different finite
verbs. An important grammatical feature that such alternative combinations may
contribute to, or directly instantiate, is transitivity at the clause level. For example, the
particle birriwirlib 'roll, tumble' with either main motion verb, 'go' or 'come' may only
occur as part of an intransitive clause structure. However, with either wudba- (which by
itself means 'to throw') or bu-, the combination can only occur within a transitive clause
structure (with appropriate pronominal adjuncts, etc.). There are many ways in
Wardaman that such intransitive/transitive pairs or sets with the same verb particle are
implemented, and sometimes here an (at least partial) semantic compatibility between
particle and co-occurring finite verb can be discerned by examining the set of possible
pairings into which each particle may enter (as above, the two pairings with birdij). For
instance, two common combinations into which the particle bard enters are: bard wudba'throw down', and bard we- 'fall down'. From this can be discerned some of the
semantic components associated with bard rather than with the finite verb, i.e., trajectory
downwards. In another example, we find the combinations barlarra gi- 'to hide', and
barlarrajingi- 'to hide, be in hiding', where the lexical semantics of the finite verbs ('to
put' and 'to be, sit' respectively) are expanded into the difference between transitive and
intransitive clause structures. Compare the different possibilities of pairing with bod-ba
'visit': with na- 'see', it means 'to visit'; with nyanga- (otherwise 'to come') the pair
means 'come to visit', and with lawu- (otherwise 'to reach, get to, catch up to, fetch'),
something like 'visit with'.
There are many instances where alternative pairing does not change transitivity value,
but rather subtly alters verbal semantics. The particle birrij-ba with bu- (by itself, 'hit,
strike') means 'to knead'; but with me- (otherwise, 'to get') means 'to stir'. Both finite
verbs determine transitive clause-level structures. Similarly, bag-ba with ya- (by itself
'to go') may be translated simply 'to break'; but with we- (ordinarily, 'to fall') may be
translated 'fall and break, break in falling'. Both of the finite verbs here instantiate
intransitive clause structures.
So far most of the examples have involved pairings in which the particle appears more
specialized than the finite verb in its lexical semantics. We may say this on the basis that
verbs like gi- and bu- occur in combination with many different particles, and in many
instances the semantic contribution of the verb amounts to little more than the
specification of general type of action, or minimally, determination of the transitivity of
the clause. There are, however, pairings with what might be described as semantically
more specific lexical verbs, which co-occurring particles seemingly further qualify. Here
the verbs contribute not only transitivity, but a more specialized lexical meaning. AnCategories of the finite verb 173example in point in the verb bewe- 'to step on, tread upon', which has been found paired
with particles bengmarla in the meaning 'to snap, break', and gilywaj in the meaning 'to
trample'. See 8.19. for more detailed examination of causativization and other transitive/
intransitive pairings.
Insofar as a finite verb appears to only specify transitivity and contribute little to
predicate semantics, it is convenient to consider it an ""Auxiliary"" verb. In interlinear
glosses, many finite verbs in particular constructions are so labelled. However, as we
have seen, there is a variable degree to which finite verbs in particle* verb constructions
may be defined as having only an auxiliary function. Partly by examining alternative
pairings with the same particle, additional degrees of predicate function and semantic
contribution can be discerned.
It can also be seen that particles function to specify verbal semantics. The more fully
they do so, the more limited they are in their possible pairings with finite verbs. The
more generalized they are semantically, the greater are their possibilities of co-occurrence
with a variety of lexical verbs. There is a point at which we want to call the more general
modifiers ""adverbs"", and as has already been indicated at several places in this
description, there is no absolute line that can be drawn in Wardaman between verb
particles and adverbs — both, for example, can form adclausal complements, but the
latter are more limited in this respect. It is, however, useful to recognize a general
difference between the two word-classes in the terms given.
Finite verbs fall into several different formal classes. There is a small but very
important set of 15 or 16 CV roots (see 8.16.), all of these are of high frequency both as
independent verbs, and most also as auxiliaries or supporting predicates in particle+ verb
constructions. These are ba- 'burn, thirst', bu- 'hit', ga- 'take', gi- 'put', la- 'bite', lu'cry', me- 'get', na 'see', ni- 'bring', nge- 'sing', ngu- 'eat, consume', we- 'fall', wo'give', να- 'go', yo- 'spear', and yu-, copula (see 8.20.). The verb ""go"" is so irregular
that it is not particularly useful to classify it as a CV- root, hence the alternative 15 or 16.
There are finite verbs of two syllables which are morphologically unanalyzable, or
monomorphemic. Examples are bewe- 'tread on', buju- 'to dig', gaju- 'to rise, grow',
gerle- 'to taste', gerne- 'to take away from'; gewu- 'to shoo, chase away', gila- 'to water,
douse', ginye- 'to cook'Jingi- to sit', linyje- 'to cut', megbe- 'to snap' golo- 'to laugh
at', menyje- 'to feel', mowo- 'to steal', ngenyje- 'to choke', nyanga- 'to come', waja'to leave', yana- 'to do, say', yeli- 'to call out', and yonga- 'to farewell'. Some of these
show a suggestively similar final syllable, e.g., the final -(ny)je- in linyje- 'cut', menyje 'feel', and ngenyje- 'choke', indicating that this may be historically analyzable.
Some verbs of two syllables, and all of three syllables or more, are morphologically
analyzable into two parts, a variable initial element and a small set of inseparable, final
auxiliary-like elements. These include the pairs -ma and -ba which are in complementary
distribution depending on the stem-final element; -wu and -bu, also in complementary
distribution; a small number of verbs with final element -ma, suggesting that this also
may be historically separable; a small number of verbs with final syllable -rla some of
which contrast with verbs which lack this element, and on the basis of which the final
syllable may be seen as a transitivizing element; and a few verbs which contain a final
syllable ->·/- (post-nasal -ji-), identical with what is elsewhere the reflexive-reciprocal174 Chaptersmarker, but which here must be defined as a formal marker of a small class of
mediopassive verbs.
Where the syllable -ma occurs, the initial element may be analyzed as ending in any
segment but a stop; the shape -ba follows stops. Examples are: giirrg-ba- 'sleep',
gayg-ba-' shout', barlirrg-ba-' sweep', bidbid-ba-' twirl firedrill', borlorrod-ba-' spread
o\A\jongorog-ba- 'yawn' Jornog-ba- 'fill up', lorrod-ba- 'sharpen', mowoj-ba- 'sneak
away', wud-ba- 'throw'; yerrb-(b)a- 'be ashamed', yid-ba- 'sharpen', andyurrg-ba'feel'. Examples with final -ma- axe:jong-ma-' kiss' Jorl-nia-' kick', nmrndi-nia-' mind,
look after', newerr-tna- 'be hungry', nginy-nta- 'help', ngorr-nia- 'grind', ngunyangma- 'knead', warrang-nia- 'swear', warrgany-ma- 'mess up', born-nia- 'bathe, wash',
and others. This final syllable, -ba or -nia, is probably to be seen as historically relatable
to the final particle suffix of the same allomorphy (11.1.2.). Such a relationship is
supported by the fact that there are some forms with this final syllable which are inflecting
verbs, or alternatively may function as verb particles, e.g., finite ngorlog-ba-, and particle
ngorlogba; or inflecting born-nia-, and particle bornborn 'bathe'.
The shape-ΗΊί occurs after non-nasal sonorants, while -bu occurs after stops and nasals.
Examples of each are: bel-wii- 'slice', jewu- 'show', lawn- 'get, fetch, reach'; versus
lid-bu- 'sew', /wr/z-im- 'make^yerrenggej-bii- 'rummage, make a mess of, jarram-bu'look iar'Jinjin-bu- 'give work to, lay tasks upon', dem-bu- 'peck at'. Historically, this
final element is probably to be related to the finite independent verb bu-, but cannot be
synchronically identified with it, as their past tense suffixes differ (e.g., bel-wu-rri 'he
sliced it' versus bu-ndi' he hit it').
The few verbs which end suggestively, for the purposes of historical analysis, in -rna
are: jomarna- 'to finish off, ledbarna- 'see', and wojbarna- 'listen'. This may be
relatable to na- 'see'.
The verbs which end in -rla, some of which also contrast with stems which lack the
final syllable, are the following:
gayg-babiyima-rladagba-rlawema-rla-'call out'(intransitive) vs.
'inflate' (transitive)
'have' (transitive)
'vomit' (something) vs.gayg-ba-rla-'call out to'wentiyi-'vomit'The small class of verbs called semantically ""Mediopassive"", and which are

"298 Chapter 1212.2.4. Yilama 'maybe, it might be that'
The particle yilama expresses a moderate degree of uncertainty concerning a predication,
or sometime s concerning a nominal as the correct identification of an argument in relation
to a predication. This particle is not limited in its possible occurrences with tense-aspectmood forms of the verb; it seemingly may occur with all of them, though of course it is
much less likely to occur where the ""basic"" predicate form by itself expresses uncertainty
or hypotheticality, as does the future-admonitive. We saw above in discussion of gala
that the ordinary future does not express uncertainty in this sense, and in accordance with
that we find that yilama may freely subcategorize its modality.
The uncertainty expressed by yilama is understood to be attributable to the speaker
whenever the subject of a predication is first person or includes a first person, i.e.,
whenever the speaker and grammatical subject coincide or partly overlap. Because of
this, yilama in such contexts is often best translated as Ί think', Ί suppose' or the like,
making clear the locus of uncertainty. When the grammatical subject is other than first
person, i.e., there is not coincidence of speaker and subject, the uncertainty expressed by
yilama is still clearly authored by the speaker, but is not understood to be as clearly
attributable to him or her, but seems rather to be understood as a degree of uncertainty
concerning the prepositional content of the clause itself, best glossed as ""maybe,
perhaps"" or the like.
As described in 7.5.7., yilama (which formally appears to contain a morph identifiable
with the particle suffix, -ma, but inseparable here) commonly occurs with the indefinite
suffix -gan. This was described as differing from -warda in ""intensity"" of query (cf.
7.5.8.), the latter being more externally directed and a stronger elicitation of response.
-gan thus is often to be understood as expressing self-interrogation, with approximately
the force of a ""whatchamacallit"" kind of expression. The frequency with which -gan is
suffixed to yilama is in keeping with the extent to which the uncertainty expressed by
yilama is attributable to the speaker, whether or not this role coincides with that of
grammatical subject person. Examples of yilama (see also 715,728,732,733,734,735)
above are:

Ergative typically marks the nominal transitive subject even where there may be no
expressed nominal object, but only object marking on the verb (zero for third person
singular. See 10.10. for discussion of the ordering of lexically realized nominal
functions).
There are a number of verbal meanings for which pairs of verbs are found, one member
of the pair transitively used, the other intransitively. Examples are the pairs burla-ma'deceive, lie to' and burla-yi- 'tell lies'; geng-ma- 'to fear' and gengmi-yi- 'be afraid of
(with Dative object). The ""mediopassive"" forms appear to be used more frequently to
designate typical disposition, the others to designate particular events; thus,
ya-wurr-burla-yi-n is often used to mean 'they tell lies' (typically). (See 8.12. for the
'mediopassive' category.)
By ""ditransitive"" constructions are meant those in which there are two notional (and
sometimes, overtly expressed or non-zero) objects. One of these is typically animate,
and generally, but not always, also human, the notional ""indirect object""; the other is
usually inanimate, the notional ""direct object"" of the action. Verbs or verb plus particle
constructions which are typical predicates of such clauses, include: wo- 'give to';jewu'show to, teach'; also birrg gerne- 'to take from', mowo- 'to steal from\jomarna~ 'finish'
(e.g., food). Examples with such predicates illustrate the case-marking of associated
nominals:66 Chapters(8)yarrimanbu-yi

Here, the first prosodic line is equivalent to a clause, with Ergative-marked nominal
""taipan"", but no overt nominal object. That object is made overt initially in the following

object is expressed by Absolutive-marked ""poison"".

Here again, notional indirect object is expressed only on the verb, as is typical (although
emphasis could be given by use of the Absolutive independent 1SG pronoun). There
could be Ergative-marked nominal transitive subject. A ditransitive construction of this
kind contrasts syntactically with one involving verb particle plus auxiliary of similar
meaning, but in which the indirect object is expressed with the Dative (see 5.2.3.), and
the notional direct object, once again with Absolutive-marked nominal:

The verb yana- 'to say (to)' usually occurs with Dative ""person to whom"" something
is said. However, it has alternatively been found to occur with ""person to whom"" treated
as direct object, as in the following example where it occurs with particle jarnbab 'tryNominal classes, inflection and derivation 67to, persist in (unsuccessfully)' (Kriol 'hard work (la)'). Compare the alternative case

As already noted, nominals functioning instrumentally can be distinguished from
transitive subject nominals in that they are not in agreement with pronominal marker on
the verb. For example, the verb ba- 'burn, thirst, perish' most typically enters into two
kinds of constructions: one, with intransitive subject (usually marked only on the verb
by prefix) and dative complement expressing that for which one is burning (wiya-wu 'for
water'); and one with intransitive subject, the experiencer, and instrumental complement
expressing that which is causing one to thirst or burn:
(16)nga-ba-n
ISG-burn-PRESmarninggani-yi
sun-INST'I'm burning in the sun'.
Since ""sun"" can never show verbal agreement, it is regarded as Instrument rather than
transitive subject. Instrument thus marks the nominal that expresses the means by which
an action is accomplished, as distinct from the agent of the action, the transitive subject.
Other examples of Instrumental nominals are:

"Chapter 12
Clausal particles, conjunctions, and interjections12.1. Introduction
In this chapter are drawn together several functionally diverse categories of elements,
most of them categorizable as ""particles"" in having independent word status, and not
inflecting. However, some of the forms discussed in this chapter are clitics, and others
(like marrig, 12.2.1.) are clitic-like in usually occupying a determinate position
(following the first full word) of the clause. Beyond that, the forms are divisible into at
least three functional sets, with a degree of overlap between any two, in that some forms
may be assigned to more than one set.
The first set, called ""clausal particles"", function to subcategorize the predicate in terms
of modal semantics, and occur in construction with the entire clause. To an extent, some
of these clausal particles tend to occur with certain tense-aspect-mood inflectional forms
of the verb (as gala 'try' often occurs with future), but most are not as clearly restricted
in this way. One, bujun 'if etc., occurs frequently in the construction of conditional
clauses, but this is not its sole function. Other members of this set, such as yilama 'might
be' freely occur with a range of different verb forms, and generally introduce a meaning
of speaker speculation or hypothesis ""I suppose"" etc.
The second set, ""conjunctions"", generally function to specify ""the way in which what
is to follow is systematically connected to what has gone before"" (Halliday and Hasan
1976: 227). Several different semantic sub-types of conjunctive relations are
distinguished.
The third set, ""interjections"", are forms which constitute a complete utterance by
themselves. However, while they may do so formally, interjections are of course also
cohesive, and express comment partly on elements of the communicative situation, rather
than simply upon its prepositional content. To the extent that they do the former, they
are conjunctive in the general sense given above. We find therefore that one of the major
conjunctions, ngala 'but, however', also occurs as interjection.
There is a small set of forms (two independent words, and one clitic) that combine
text-cohesive and interjectional properties in a way that does not lend itself to neat
labelling or classification; these are discussed as a sub-class of (most explicitly)
""interpersonal elements"", a label not intended to suggest that other formal classes and
elements do not have an interpersonal dimension.","[314, 315]"
"Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 271A similar meaning would be expressed by the subordinate verb form without suffix;
but its addition seems to focus on simultaneity of the two actions or conditions expressed
by the predicates of clauses so linked. The suffix may be added to finite verb forms:
(655)nga-njigbe-warra
ISG-go-FUT-ADVnana
that-ABSya-0-nyangi-we
3-3SG-come-FUTyiwarna-gari
other-other'When I will go the other fellow will come'.
The same suffix is added to verb particles, and these function as clause complements:
(1) designating the time at which something took place; or (2) as secondary predicates
with verbs of motion, the kind of action undertaken during or as a result ofthat motion.
In the first usage, the suffix is added to particles designating events, for example:
(656)lilg-ba-warra
dryup-ADVbarrunin
fish-ABSlag
dessicate0-ngegba-rri
3SG-AUX-PST'When it [water] dried, the fish died and dried up'.
The particle lilg-ba is usually combined with ya- to mean 'dry up', and is often used
in reference to seasonal drying up of water bodies. Such minimal temporal complements
as these differ little from nominals designating seasons and conditions, similarly suffixed,
e.g., wu-jerrij-barra 'when it is cold, in cold-weather time'.
As secondary predicates with verbs of motion, the complement clause may have a
Dative, semantically direct object, and further nominal complements are also Dative
marked. Common in this function is the particle gej-(ba) 'ask'; as clausal predicate with
finite verb gi~ it takes a direct (animate) object, the person asked.

child-ABS'He came to ask Oliver about the initiation, when they might bring the child'
[initiand].
(Here as is often the case, the word meaning ""plain"" or ""flat ground"" is contextually
understood to refer and allude to ""ceremony ground"", and the activity of initiation
conducted there.) Gej-ba-warra has a semantically direct object, the person asked; and
that asked about is also Dative-marked (the nominal ""plain""; the more precise content of
the question is encoded in a clause linked to the preceding by the (usually) interrogative
pronoun ""when"", here functioning as a temporal relativizer.","[294, 295]"

(722) and (723) are examples with predicate that have distinctive future stems (8.2.).
These examples, compared with those in 8.9.1., show that the admonitive meaning may
be understood as such with or without bujun. Though as noted bujun usually occurs
following the predicate in such constructions, it may occur in first clausal position:
(724)bujun
lestnunu-jologbi
IRR2NSG-urinate-FUTlagla-ya
camp-LOCwarlgin-(n)ya
bed-LOC'You might pee in your bed!'
In (724), the admonitive (future stem form) of the verb is sufficient to indicate that this
is not a conditional construction.
The 'lest, it might be the (unwelcome) case that' usage of bujun is conveyed in Kriol
by Wardaman speakers by the construction ""by-and-by"" plus subject plus predicate, e.g.,
""by and by you fall down"". Like the Wardaman construction, this is not a simple statement
of certain event, but a warning regarding possible consequence.
12.2.3. Gala 'try'
The particle gala has been found in construction with verbs in the following tenseaspect-mood forms: present, admonitive (marked by zero-stem form or distinctive future
stem, depending on the verb), and imperative. With predicates in present tense, only first
person forms, or pronominal adjuncts which include a first person, have been found to
occur. That is, with present tense which expresses relative certainty or imminence of
unfulfilled action, apparently only first persons (or first-plus-others) can have the
appropriate intentional status as actors. In construction with gala, although formal
admonitive and imperative forms have both been found to occur, the former are
uncommon, and semantically not clearly distinct from the imperative, among other
reasons because such forms have only been found with second person subjects. The only
difference may be between admonitive and imperative that the former make the
imperative force of the utterance slightly less, or more tentative. See discussion
following the examples concerning why gala may occur with ""admonitive"" future-tense
forms, and not with the ordinary future (8.6.). First, examples of gala with first person
(plus) pronominal adjuncts, and present tense forms are:296 Chapter 12(725) gala nga-gerle-n

The fact that this is not possible shows that gala is not equivalent to English ""try"", and
that its core meaning is one of uncertainty concerning an as-yet unrealised state of affairs.
Combined with the present tense, gala expresses intention of the first person (plus) subject.
Combined with first- or second-person subject future-admonitive forms, it expresses
either the subject's inner sense of necessity to do what the predicate designates (first
persons), or the attribution (to second persons) of an intentional force. Notice then how
such future-admonitive forms appear to differ from the ordinary future, e.g., nganjigbe
Ί will go, I must go', in which no sense of indeterminacy or uncertainty is attributable
to the subject, but rather only unmitigated volition, intention, or necessity to the subjectpredicate combination as a whole. The ordinary future, in other words (see 8.6.) is a form
of the verb which expresses all such meanings but without clearly distinguishing if, or
the extent to which, they are to be attributed to the subject, or exactly where necessity
and intentionality are to be located. The distinctive future-stem or admonitive
construction differs from the ordinary future precisely in modality, in that it expresses
uncertainty (and most generally, undesirability) of an as-yet unrealised state of affairs. It
is thus possible for it (rather than the ordinary future) to co-occur with gala. With
imperative forms, gala expresses the clearer attribution of uncertainty to the agency of
the second person subject, i.e., ""you try to do X"" (but you may not succeed).
Seeing ""uncertainty"" as the core semantic dimension of gala, with different
modulations of intentionality varying with tense-aspect-mood form of the verb, helps to
understand the interjectional formation possible with this particle, gala-warda, best
translated as either Ί don't know', or more generally'who knows?','it's not clear', where
the uncertainty is understood in relation to the speaker as a pragmatic effect of the usage
of the expression. Here, gala is paired with the indefinite suffix -warda (7.5.8.), and is
thus a regular member of the set of forms which may be so suffixed, expressing general
uncertainty. Examples of usage of this form are shown in the following conversation-like
sequences (invented by informants without suggestion as to content, to illustrate the
meaning of gala-warda):

"6.5. Genitive independent pronouns
In addition to ""base"" and Dative series pronominal forms, there is a distinct Genitive
series, with the following forms:
1SG
nganinggin2
3yinggawun
gungan.ginDUAL
yawungginNSG
ngarmgun.gin
yirrugun.gin
nurrugun.gin
wurrugun.ginThe genitive element in this series (except for 2SG) is evidently -gin (see 11.4.), and it
would appear that, historically, this series was built on the Dative, but has subsequently
become formally independent of the latter.
The genitive series serves: adnominally, to mark the pronominal possessor, sometimes
in conjunction with a free Dative form of the same propositus person; to mark that aIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 119contextually understood or specifiable, but lexically unspecified, nominal is possessed.
Such a ""headless"" Genitive phrase functions itself as predicate argument. The Genitive
pronouns, as attributives and as arguments in their own right, may be inflected for the
full range of nominal case endings, as exemplified with 1SG:

arguments, they may be appropriately translated in some contexts as ""on me"", ""from me"",
and the like; that is, express personal reference, rather than being modifiers. The
following exemplify the different uses of the Genitive forms:

'Let the grog be, leave it, get meat and food, tobacco and matches as we always
get ours, food for the children, live without grog like us'.
In (223) the Genitive pronoun yirrugun.gin serves as attributive of a nominal phrase
(presumably ""meat, food"" etc. actually ellipsed within the prosodic line, which ended
with the possessive pronoun in the original utterance). The speaker resumes with the120 Chapter 6phrase ""food for the children"". Further examples illustrating a variety of points are all
drawn from a single text:

The modifying phrase which specifies the identity of the old woman (""my father's

'They beat him severely and he left he died on my account, only his children
called me a sorcerer'.
This example shows a Dissociative-marked Genitive pronoun meaning ""on account of
me, on my account"". In the context, the speaker's meaning was not literally that the man
referred to had died on her account, but there is here rather more complex attribution of
""authorship"". The speaker's meaning was that the man's children said that he had died
on account of her — they alleged she had poisoned him; thus the ""voice"" of the clause
""he died on my account"" is that of the man's accusing relatives, yi-geye-mulu, somewhat
unsually in this syntactic context, occurs in Absolutive (rather than Ergative) form.
However, that may be linked to the fact that the speaker paused briefly following the
phrase ""his children"", perhaps considering how to put the unpleasant accusation. (In the
first line, digirrij may mean either (completely) dead, or as we say, ""near-dead"",
""half-dead"", or the like. Here, the meaning is that the beating was severe, but that the
man was able to carry himself off).
Finally, when Genitive pronouns are used in headless phrases, it is rather common that
the possessive phrase be expanded by use of a complementary free Dative pronoun of
the same person and number (see also 10.4.). For example, a typical verbless predication
of possession is of the following sort:
(231) nana
that-ABSnganinggin
nganu
/
1SGGEN-ABS 1SGDATgungan.gin
gunga
3SGGEN-ABS 3SG DAT'That is mine'/'That is his, hers'.
An example of this kind of Absolutive Genitive, which in context occurred as object
of the verb ""put"", is:

free forms
The base pronominal forms, Absolutive and Ergative, in their functions as explained in
6.1. above, commonly occur suffixed with the article -hi ~ -wi. The article suffix (as
described in 5.7.), when added to a non-nominal part of speech, serves to nominalize or
make more concrete its reference; and when added to a nominal form, does something
like make its reference more definite, in a way that is often best translatable by English
substitutive ""one"" (""big one"", etc.). Yet the article cannot be regarded as a form that
stands in place of an ellipsed lexical expression (as English substitutive ""one"" does).
Rather, in keeping with the fact that Wardaman nominals of adjectival kind very
commonly constitute a nominal phrase by themselves (see Chapter 4), what the article
does is to suggest more concretely a domain of reference of which the current nominal
token is ""one"". The article suffix thus performatively marks, not ellipsis, but
definitivization.
The article suffix is commonly added to free pronouns, both Absolutive and Ergative
(see an example of the latter in (199)). Following the Ergative suffix, the article
invariably has the shape -wi; thus the Ergative-article sequence is yi-wi, as in 1SG
ERG-ART ngayug-ji-wi, etc. However, in the Absolutive series we find apocope of the
final vowel of the 1SG form before the article suffix, the occurring form being not
ngayugu-wi but ngayug-bi. For the sake of clarity the article-suffixed Absolutive forms
are listed:
1SG

nurrug-bi (also nurrug-(g)uya-wi DU, nurrug-bulu-wi PL)3SGnarnaj-bi3DU
3PLnarnaj-guya-wi
narnaj-bulu-wi, narnaj-ganung-biWith the free pronouns, the article suffix usually contributes an emphatic element of
meaning reinforcing the pronoun's reference, something like ""I myself, as in:
(233) nga-gaju-wa
ngayug-bi
ISG-arise-FUT
1SG-ABS-ART
Ί for one will get up', Ί myself will get up'.
In comparison with this, as observed in 6.1., the essentially third person form ngajbang
which may occur with any person/number form, is often understood to express a different
nuance, ""I alone"", or ""I by myself.
Built on the base stems, and showing the same slight differences from the latter as the
article-suffixed forms, is a series which expresses that the referent of the pronoun isIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 123""first"". This series is formed with the suffix -baywa ~ -waywa. It is syntactically
anomalous in that it often is understood as in construction with a transitive subject
pronominal form in the verb, in which instance one normally expects any external
pronoun to be Ergative-marked. The ordinary interpretation of these forms, however,
appears to be as in construction with the agent pronominal in transitive clauses, despite
the absence of Ergative marking, as in:
(234)ngayug-baywa
1SG ABS-firstngawun-da-rri
1 SG/3NSG-see-PSTΊ saw them first' [I before others saw them].
(235)namaj-baywa
3SG ABS-firstngan-da-rri
3SG/lSG-see-PST'He saw me first' [he before others].
Like the article suffix, this suffix is final, and follows any overtly-marked dual number:
e.g., nurrug-(g)uya-waywa 'you two first'.
This suffix has also been found with certain primary adverbs to create secondary ones
which seem to have a somewhat more explicit relational sense, e.g., fromjaburru 'ahead,
in front', jaburrung-baywa 'first, ahead of anyone'. It is also suffixed to nominal stems
to create more adverbial forms of manner: yi-bam-baywa 'head-first', banggin-baywa
'back-first'.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"

"Segmental phonology 17The contrast between apical series is amply illustrated elsewhere, morpheme- and
word-medially and finally. In word-final position note the contrasts between members
of each series:
/gulid/
/menjen/'green plum'
'dangerous'vs.
vs.
vs./mardird/
/mejern/
/yingelembern/'whistling kite'
'belly'
'collarbone'/jurrul/'saltwater turtle'vs./nyurl/'be/get angry'There are additionally numerous examples of minimal and sub-minimal contrasts
medially between the two series: e.g., wu-walu 'ring finger' vs. wu- warli 'arm, creek,
tributary'; yirrgitlun 'river' vs.yigurliyn 'first rain'; ngone 'hooked spear' vs. wurne
'bone'; yi-welen 'jealousperson' vs.yi-werlen 'lazy person'; bidij 'twist' vs.birdij'find'
(particles); gelelen 'cold' vs. gerle- 'to taste'; gitda 'where' vs. bigurda, a kind of plat
potato; gadi 'lily' vs. gardirrg 'gnash teeth' (particle), and so on.
The above generalization does not apply to the rhotics, since /IT/ has not been found
initially in lexical stems, and only two instances of /r/ have been noted to date: the bird
term rewrew 'dollar bird', and a toponym (referring to a creek near Willeroo Station
homestead in the Wardaman heartland, and seemingly not a foreign form), Relwuyugun.
Besides the fact that the bird term is onomatopoetic, it should also be noted that very
similar terms for this bird occur in neighbouring languages. It is likely that there are
complex diffusional relations among them. However, in Jawoyn the form of the word is
dewdew, and beyond the surmise that the diffusional source is not from Jawoyn, it is not
clear why Wardaman should have a form with an initial segment that does not otherwise
occur in that position in the language.
/rr/ does occur initially in inflectional morphemes which can never be word-initial, e.g.,
in the past tense allomorph -rri. /r/ is (so far) not attested in stem-final position, indicating
at the least that it is c[uite uncommon there, if indeed it may occur at all. The apical /rr/
however is common finally, e.g., /bamarr/ Owenia vernicosa, 'marble tree', /geremerr/
'headband', and so on.
Medially, the contrast between the two rhotics distinguishes a considerable number of
forms, and there is no reason to regard the contrast as marginal (cf. Cook 1987: 29 on
Wakiman). Exemplifying by comparing the sequences -ara- and-arra-, we may list the
contrasting forms, among others: war ay 'ask', baraj 'far', garab 'spider', wuniara
'heavy stone', janiaram1 lid, doof,garnaniara 'walking stick' Jabara 'putrid, stinking',
barangan 'rift,gap',darab 'bog', and-garang ~ -warang 'having'; vs. barlarra 'hide',
barragarl 'spear', buwarraja 'dreaming', lawarra 'riflefish', warrala 'lie, be spreadlegged5, warrania ' sugar glider', -barra ~ -warra adverbial suffix, among others.
Some consideration needs to be given to the statement of the distributions of the two
palatal sonorants ly and ny. We will consider the lamino-palatal lateral first, since its
distribution, however analyzed, is especially restricted Then we will return to questions
of the statement of distribution that apply to both lateral and nasal palatal segments.
The lamino-palatal lateral (unlike the nasal) never occurs in stem- or word-initial
position, and its occurrence medially (excluding, for the moment, intervocalically) and18 Chapter 2finally is quite restricted, both lexically and positionally. The following includes all
instances of medial (save intervocalic) and final ly found in a list of approximately 2000
(mostly lexical) roots (excluding names of all sorts, personal, toponymic and other):
bedelybedeyl
bilyb(a)
bilybanbilyban
dilygba
ally gun
dilyma
ganyjayl
gilywaj
jalybug
jilyma
milygbilygba
wily ma
wilyma
yarrbayl'hit all over, flog'
'switch, swish long object over' (esp. in curing)
'devil dog' (etym. related to above)
'wait'
'possum'
'light, burn'
'annoy, bother, disturb'
'trample'
'pound, crush up, mince'
'wring out, squeeze (juices) out of
'beat, thump, ""heart-crack"" [Kr.], be shocked'
'stretch'
'whistle' (different AUX from above)
'bother, annoy'This list demonstrates that about half the instances of the lamino-palatal lateral are final
in verb particles (which often have the additional morph -ma, see 11.1.2.)· Otherwise,
the lateral occurs only before peripheral segments (mainly stops b and g, but note one
instance before w). Overall, the lateral shows a nearly-complete lexical restriction to verb
particles (with the exception ofdilygun 'possum', and the derivate bilybanbilyban).
There are comparable distributional restrictions on the lamino-palatal lateral in
Yangman, as far as the more limited data indicate. Also, there is in Mangarrayi a small
handful of />'-final verb particles (four have been found). And though all of these appear
to also occur in Yangman, and evidently represent an historical diffusion from that
language, inquiry indicates they are now regarded by speakers as Mangarrayi words, and
not as recognizable borrowings. The restricted distribution of this lateral can, on the basis
of the evidence, be seen as an areal phenomenon in which Mangarrayi participates
marginally.
In Wardaman, there seems to be little plausibility to the suggestion that these instances
may be viewed (historically) as combinations of / plus a high vowel IM phonetically
realized as palatalization. There are enough cases of stem-final // (e.g., mangali 'girl,
female') to make it clear that such palatalization is not, in any event, a synchronic process.
And there are attestations of word-final lyi, as in /malyi/, toponym. In contrast with the
lateral, the palatal nasal is much more common stem-finally, and is distributed over
different parts of speech (e.g., juyn 'to set' (of sun, particle), jirrangaliyn 'mud
swallow'). It, too, contrasts directly with final nyi (as in mobonyi 'night time').
There is, however, some question about analysis of both palatal sonorants
intervocalically, simply because in that position there is no clear or convincing basis for
a contrast between ly versus a combination /+ y, or between ny versus n+ y, as thereSegmental phonology 19is finally. This is true, for example, of a word for a catfish species, which could
alternatively be /ginyang/ or /ginyang/, or the word for 'echidna' which might
alternatively be represented phonemically as /gawalyan or /gawalyan/.
The question of a two-segment versus single-segment analysis may simply be said to
be irrelevant in those medial environments. There is no phonetic difference that can be
established between the two possibilities. We can show this by observing intermorphemic combinations of n + y and / + y, where the y is the initial segment of an
inflectional suffix (e.g., YI-buruwun-yi 'killer', ERG). In the text transcriptions in
practical orthography, morphemic combination is always distinguished from intramorphemic ny and ly by a hyphen at morpheme boundary.
In summary concerning word- and morpheme-final position, we note that all stops and
nasals, all the laterals, the glides /y/ and /w/, and apical /IT/ are attested, while /r/ is not.
A few examples attest to final contrast between each glide, and the combination of glide
and homorganic vowel, for example:
dawu'that way'vs.waray'ask'vs.daw
also maw
gunduyi-ma'sound sleep',
'take off'
'give hiding, belt'The set of final nasal contrasts is illustrated by:
yi-mum
gunbilin
mejern
garnbayn
gayardung'eye'
'(native) doctor'
'stomach'
'type of cabbage palm'
'run'The contrast among laterals finally is exemplified by:
jil-ma
jily-ma
mirlirl-ma'company, keep company' (particle)
'wring, squeeze' (particle)
'rise' (of sun)The final contrast among stops is illustrated by:
bardab
dulwad
mardird
garnbij
gandawag'look around'
'count, enumerate'
'kite'
'clapstick'
'moon'2.4. Phonotactics: Consonant clusters
There are no morpheme-initial consonant clusters except for the very rare combination
gl, so far attested in only two forms: -gle 'putrid, rotten', and medially in the (obligatorily
reduplicative) particle lowaglowa 'play', gle- has never been found to occur20 Chapter 2word-initially, but rather is always preceded by one of the noun class prefixes (yi-gle,
wu-gle). There is also a place name wugleni 'Johnstone Hole', which might be related
etymologically to the root -gle. There is at least one instance, in a bird name, of a
particularly minimal and indistinct, if indeed organic, vocalic segment between b snarl.
This occurs in the word \jnjiirijbllrlan]' friar bird'. However, there are no other instances
suggesting the possibility of a cluster bl.
Within morphemes, combinations of apical nasal plus apical stop contrast as between
the two apical series: nd vs. rnd. As in neighbouring languages, there are no such
combinations in which the nasal and stop differ in place. The same is true for the (rare)
combinations of lateral plus apical stop (e.g., Id, which only occur at reduplicative
boundaries). The transcriptional practice adopted for the retroflex combinations is to
write the indicator of retroflexion only once, thus: rnd, rid.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"312 Chapter 12Interestingly, not a single instance of this particle showed up in collected texts. For this
search, 87 pages of computerized text, and a further 60 pages of handwritten, glossed and
analyzed text, were used as the searched corpus, the material ranging from life-history
monologue, to requested myth narrative, to recorded night-time fire-side conversation.
Attempts to elicit an explicit causal linkage were answered with examples using

This element has a clitic-like status: it appears to follow immediately the main
constituent with respect to which ""cause"" or reason is being expressed. Constructions of
this kind seem to be formulated in such a way that it generally has a nominal constituent
within its scope; but see example (849).
12.3.6. Gija 'just as, as'
There is a conjunction gija which allows statement of the comparability of the content of
two clauses, and is best glossed 'as', 'just as', or 'in the same way that'. Wagayma (see
5.10.) may be used to express comparability at the clause level, as well as at the constituent
level, and so partly overlaps functionally with gija, examples of which follow.

The most pervasive, and in some ways most difficult to define, Wardaman conjunctive
element, is -wan, labelled throughout DF, or ""defocusser"". This is a suffix, rather than
an independent word, and we may begin discussion of the rather subtle cohesive
functioning of this element by considering some regularities of positioning that relate to
its formal dependence.
Most common positional occurrences of -wan are: suffixed to the first word in the tone
group; or suffixed to what may be defined as the first word in a non-initial clause-unit
within a tone group. That is, the occurrence of -wan is most simply described first, in
terms of prosodic rather than grammatical units; but secondly, in terms of its function in
linking clause-level grammatical units within a tone group. These, however, are only
tendencies, and -wan may be found in non-initial position both with respect to tone group
and/or grammatical group; and also, may be suffixed to seemingly the entire range of
different word-level parts of speech. Before we proceed to examine what contribution it
makes, these statements of occurrence require some further explanation.
It may be useful to expand briefly here on what has been said (10.14.) about the
relationship between tone group and clause-level unit.
The general tendency towards coincidence of tone group and clause-level unit may be
illustrated by text extract, divided into prosodic lines:

they put it in the coolamon
they put another under the coals
they put it in a heap, thus
from the food, from those seeds
they gave it out to them one-by-one [severally]'.
In this passage, the tendency for tone group and clause to coincide is realized almost
completely, with the exception of the second-to-last line, which consists only of a nominal
phrase (or series of closely linked and commonly case-marked phrases), making explicit
what is being referred to in the next line, as being given out, and cohering over a much
longer textual stretch with earlier occurrences of the word mayin 'vegetable food'.
Another common tendency is for the tone group to coincide with two clauses, i.e., for
close textual coherence between two clauses to be signalled and confirmed by their
inclusion within a single tone group, such as:
(804)nu-lawu
wirrb nu-me
2NSG-reach wipe
2NSG-AUX
warnarr-warra
yi-lawu-rri-wuya
fat-ADV
lEXNSG-reach-PST-DUwirrb
wipeyitr-me-ndi
1EXNSG-AUX-PST'You go to him and wipe him
we went to him and wiped him with fat'.
Types of constructions involving particles which make the coincidence of tone group
with clause less complete, and create more structurally variable text units, were described
in 10.14.
The single most clearly identifiable contribution that -wan makes is that it signals
linkage to, or general textual cohesion of, a sequence in relation to a preceding one. The
""scope"" of such retrospective cohesive relations cannot be neatly structurally defined,
but is influenced by the nature of the grammatical unit or constituent to which -wan may
be seen as suffixed. For example, it becomes relevant to observe here that while there is
relatively little use of an element of the ""then, next, after that"" type, there is some use in
that function of the Ablative form of the demonstrative nana 'that', i.e., nan-ba 'from
there, then' etc. Very commonly where this occurs, -wan is suffixed to it, and thus while
the conjunction itself expresses forward textual movement, -wan expresses what has been
called a retrospective cohesion, or an explicit indication of a textual link with what has
gone before. The entire sequence would thus best be glossed ""and then, and from there"",
i.e., where -wan has a rather purely structural, linking function, the semantics of which
however is highly coloured by the nature of that to which it is suffixed. An example is:

The reason for which -wan has been labelled ""Defocusser"" throughout remains to be
clarified, and is related to the seemingly very broad kind of cohesion-signalling device
that it is. Insofar as its central function is that of signalling linkage, its occurrence appears
to have the overall textual effect of a kind of de-emphasis ofthat to which is it suffixed
and/or which it appears to be relating to preceding text. In other words, this effect of
de-emphasis is best understood as a consequence of its function, that of signalling that
something is to be related to what has gone before. This downplays the textual novelty
and independence of that which -wan introduces, and treats it as topical in the sense of
presupposable, whether or not it has been previously introduced. ""Given"" and ""new""
cannot be treated as an axis independent of the construction of text, and -wan appears to
constitute information as presupposable.
Following with comment are instances of the occurrence of -wan, variably positioned
and always illustrated with sufficient surrounding text material to try to give some sense
of its textual placement.

Suffixation of -wan to wiyan creates a textual linkage, that is, signalling not explicitly
the simultaneity of the two events, but their textual relation to each other.
