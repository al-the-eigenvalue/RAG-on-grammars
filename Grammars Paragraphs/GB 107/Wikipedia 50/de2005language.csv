"298The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemes
suggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least in
regard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as a
monosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex of
the accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrc ‘INTS’ and
kt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must have
been responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thus
requiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- could
have operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negated
proposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that the
distribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a past
stage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition,
the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysis
as the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in the
grammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute >
*kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem final
vowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in1In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in
/t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow
scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket
morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal
communication.)299Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display the
full morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.
Other elements that may have involved the prefix ku- in earlier times include the
ergative markers and the intensifier kumrc. While it seems plausible that the intensifier
may have evolved from a verb, given its final position in the clause and the role it
performs, as a modifier of the predicate, the same may not be said of the ergative
markers.
The ergative markers t and kt must have evolved from a nominal source. My
claim is based on their distribution in the sentence and their function in present-day
Apinajé syntax, as case markers of nominal elements. However, the possibility that the
prefix ku- may have participated in the development of the suppletive third-person form
of the ergative is also present here – a path that I propose for the other two postpositions
that display suppletive forms, namely, the detrimentive and the dative, as well. The
hypothesis is displayed schematically below:(1)*ku-m

kt‘3.DAT’
‘3.DTR’
‘3.ERG’The idea proposed in (1) is that all three postpositional markers may once have
been used with the third person prefix ku. With the frequency of use, the vowels involved
underwent certain phonological changes, such that non-low vowels ended up in full
harmony, whereas in the environment of a low vowel, only partial asimilation took place,300such that the high back vowel became lowered. Eventually, all word-final vowels were
lost, giving way to a heavy monosyllabic word.
In this vein, it is hoped that this description of Apinajé will serve as a basis for
future historical and comparative work, which will allow the testing of the various
internal reconstructions proposed here, and which will also allow the creation of new,
fruitful comparative hypotheses for the reconstruction of the phonology and grammar of
Proto-Jê.","[311, 312, 313, 314]"

"3.4.3. Possessive predicates
Possessive predicates (e.g. “I have a sister”) expressed by juxtaposition in Apinajé share
some structural details with equative predicates, namely, the free pronoun must precede245the modality marker, but here it must be coreferential with the prefix on the predicate;
these morphemes refer collectively to the possessor (66.a). If the coreferentiality
condition is not met, then the construction will functionally constitute an equative
nominal predicate (66.b).(66) a. pa

DEMnaRLSIt is evident that the construction in (66.a) is structurally identical to that
expressing proper inclusion predicates introduced above (cf. (64)). Nonetheless, the
interpretation here is one of possession because the nominal predicate has an inanimate,
non-human referent. When asked whether one could get a proper inclusion interpretation
out of example (66.a), as in “I am a knife,” consultants rejected the possibility and
offered copula constructions, instead (67).(67) a. [pa na]

with the subject of the clause; compare (69.a-c) with (69.d).

obligatorily present under such coreferentiality conditions (70).(70) napa

wash3.5. Locative predicates
Locative predicates follow the same pattern as verbal clauses, since they involve position
verbs, which are typically intransitive. Thus, this clause type includes the mood marker,
the subject nominal, the locative adverbial and a position verb, such as ca ‘stand’,  ‘sit’,
or other, depending on the number of the absolutive argument (section III.3.1.2.3.)(71) a. ktkaj

Existential predicates are structurally similar to locative predicates, except that in these
constructions the verb is dispensed with. The necessary elements are simply the location
and the referent located, which typically comes accompanied by a quantifier or the
existential negative amrakati in the predication.(72) a. go

‘Around here there is a lot of farinha de puba and farinha seca.’3.7. Negation
Negation is another dimension whereby clauses can be subcategorized into structural
types. Negation applies differently depending on the type of predicate being negated.
Nominal predicates are negated with the clause-final clitic ket, verbal predicates with the
clitic sequence ket=ne, whereas existential predicates can be negated either with ket or249the negative existential pronoun amrakati; apparently, some negated locative predicates
(section 3.5) may function as negative existentials as well, except that these predicates
are characterized by the use of positional verbs in predicate position which are, therefore,
negated with ket=ne.
On the other hand, for any of these clause types, the expression of negation is not
affected by the mode (realis or irrealis) or speech-act (declarative, interrogative,
imperative) distinction of the clause.
The negation of juxtaposition nominal predicates, expressed by the simplex
negative ket, is illustrated in (73). (There are no examples of negated copular predicates
available in the database.) The examples (73.c-d) demonstrate that the complex negative
marker is not preferred in this syntactic context.","[258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263]"

go3. Clause structure
In what follows, the various types of main clause structure are introduced. It will be seen
that some of the variation found in verbal clauses is due to the major distinction between
the realis and irrealis mode, as well as to speech-act distinctions, especially the contrast
between affirmative and negative sentences. Other differences in the structure of verbal
clauses are due to the morphosyntactic nature of the predicators involved, namely, those
that entail the standard pattern of argument marking already introduced (sections III.3.2.1.
and III.4.1.1), as against those predicators that involve non-canonical patterns of argument
marking.","[236, 237]"

NEGThe negation of descriptive verb predicates, illustrated in (80), presents some
variation as to which form of the negative should be used. Most consultants tended to
employ ket=ne for negation of descriptive predicates. However, at least one consultant
showed preference for the use of the simplex negative morpheme ket in these contexts.
As seen in the examples, the predicate of the clause type in (80.a) is unambiguously
verbal; whereas in (80.b, c) the existential semantics of the constructions (ambiguous, in
example (b)) might justify the preference for ket, since existential predicates categorize
morphosyntactically with nominal predicates in Apinajé (section IV.3.5), and nominal
predicates are negated with ket.","[265, 266]"
"2243.1. Mode distinctions
The realis and irrealis encompass all clause structure types in Apinajé. That is, clauses
are either realis or irrealis, structurally. From a semantic and functional perspective, the
realis mode includes past, present, habitual – negative, positive or interrogative –
propositions. The irrealis mode comprises future, hypothetical, counterfactual,
conditional, intentive – negative, positive, interrogative and some imperative –
propositions. Speech act distinctions therefore do not interfere with mode distinctions,
for the most part (except for one type of imperative, as will be seen below).
The realis mode is encoded by the positional clitic na. As a general rule, this
marker indicates the clause initial boundary and is typically followed by a free pronoun,
which encodes the nominative argument of the clause. Tense-aspect distinctions are
expressed elsewhere in the clause, often by clitic sequences postposed to the nominative
pronoun, or by clause final clitics, subordinators, or serial constructions (41).(41) a. napa

"In the first construction (‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’), the particle ri is
immediately postposed to the clause(s) describing the first event in the sequence; the
clause expressing the second event occurs last in the sentence. In the examples below,
the two events in sequence share the same subject, so the subject is mentioned only once
at the beginning of the sentence.
Example (16.b) is more complex in that the first event of the sequence consists of
two clauses – i.e. two minor events: the wait for the potatoes to cook, and the cooking of
the potatoes. Within that domain, the subjects of the first and second events are distinct,290thus the different-subject third person conjunction occurs in the second clause. Although
there is no structural evidence of subordination between the clauses expressing the first
and second events, the ‘cook’ clause stands in a complement-type relation with the ‘wait’
clause, albeit semantically. For the purposes of the construction being described in the
present section, those two clauses are taken here as if constituting a unit.(16) a. Kt paj

Some aspects in the overall structure of ri constructions which show that the rimarked clause is in fact structurally subordinate to that in sentence-final position are as
follows. In examples (16.a) and (17.b), repeated as (18) below, the sentence-final clauses
have the typical distribution of a main predicate, and the subject of each is that expressed
by the nominative pronoun at the beginning of the whole complex sentence. As for the

and they come marked with a postposed particle that, in other contexts, may function
either as a demonstrative or a locative. An alternative semantic interpretation of the rimarked expressions in the examples below then could be, respectively, ‘at/upon/when

The morpheme kutep marks a temporal adverbial construction, which consists of
clauses that encode simultaneous events. The clauses in question do not occur in a
subordinating relation: they occur in a paratactic relation with one another and each has
its own subject. That the clauses involved belong in the same sentence is indicated by the
fact that they fall under the scope of the same mood marker; and by the intonation pattern
of the utterance, which clearly includes them both.
The morpheme kutep is a postposition that indicates something like ‘in one’s
stead’. Functionally, it clearly indicates the simultaneous relation between the events
described in each clause. As to its distribution in the sentence, it occurs in the clause that
serves as the ground event with respect to which the other, simultaneous event is located.
The person index occurring in kutep refers to the subject of the second, “figure”
clause in the temporal relation, as expressed by agreement with the independent pronoun.(19) a. Ktka

Keenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to a
greater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea of
grammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who254points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities there
are amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way they
are. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processes
which themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that are
universal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may or
may not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.
In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammatical
relations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according to
language internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems of
alignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant for
the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé
(a) word order
(b) person prefixes
(c) independent pronouns
(d) person inflection in imperative clauses
(e) the use of reflexives
(f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
(g) switch-reference strategies
(h) valency-changing operations
(i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
(j) equi-deletion in complementation
(k) coreferential deletion in coordinationThe SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful
criterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-255intransitive system in simple main clauses, and an absolutive pattern in nonfinite clauses.
To go along with the absolutive pattern, criterion (i) reveals an ergative case-marking
system that is conditioned by subordination environments. All other criteria (c-h; j-k)
betray a nominative pattern and provide strong support for the grammatical relation
Subject in Apinajé.
On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in the
language. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the O
does not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person of
O. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a uniqueform, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the Direct
Object. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving no
syntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category with
the many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot be
indexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we push
them to the next category, that of Indirect Object.
If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of the
grammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In the
traditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, and
in the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bears
one of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the category
of Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have no
morphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"

‘after; behind’The echo-vowel indicates the end of a phonological word. It occurs most often in
content words, though there are instances of echo-vowels in function words too. The
morphemes ket and kot, in (96), are a negative particle and a postposition, respectively.
The fact that these units are prominent within their respective constituents might
be one reason why these function words – and not others – tend to display echo-vowels.
Both particles and postpositions occur phrase-finally and thus have better chances of
appearing in utterance-final position, the locus of echo-vowels.
An independent hypothesis for why ket and kot display a property characteristic of
content words is that both, particle and postposition, must derive historically from content
words – a verb and a noun, respectively (chapter III). The occurrence of echo-vowels
may be one feature that indicates their diachronic origin.","[92, 93]"

go3.1.4. Adverbials
The set of adverbials includes morphologically simple and complex items, and
expressions carrying adverbial meaning or function. Adverbials constitute another one of
those almost closed classes which nevertheless seems somewhat open and expansive,
since adverbial meanings may come in phrases and other larger constituents. Some
members of this class are temporal adverbs, location adverbs, intensifiers and a temporal
negative adverbial, discussed here.
Adverbs are phonological/grammatical words that are characterized
morphologically by lack of inflection. Their distribution in the sentence depends on the
kind of adverbial function they perform. Temporal and location adverbs seem more151syntactically free than other adverbs. Intensifiers are positional clitics, as is the temporal
negative adverbial. Some of these are introduced next.","[163, 164, 165]"
"297CHAPTER VICONCLUDING REMARKSIn the previous chapters I have provided an overview of the core aspects of Apinajé
grammar – its phonology, morphology, simple clause syntax, and complex constructions
and predicates. Despite its preliminary character, the description presented here is
intended as a fresh contribution to the study and documentation of Apinajé, especially
because, for the first time, the morphology and syntax of the language are treated in detail
and from a non-formalist perspective. The functional-typological approach adopted in
the present study has made possible a richer and more fluid anaysis of the data, especially
in regard to certain puzzling patterns, such as the association of subordinating
morphology with certain domains of the grammar.
It has been noted, for instance, that the negative clitics not only require such
morphology, but display a morphological make up that may be seen as evidence for a
verbal diachronic origin, namely, the consonant k-, analyzed here as a reflex of the third
person accusative prefix. Other factors that have been considered are its clause-final
position and its possiblity of occurrence with the clitic ne. The presence of this clitic
suggests an affinity of the form ket with the class of descriptive verbs, in that some of
them often co-occur with the morpheme ne. These are simple observations, however, and
need to be further investigated.","[310, 311]"

clause are the same in either clause type.
Beyond this basic observation, it is also noticeable that kt has a more restricted
distribution than na. The latter may occur in positions other than clause initially; in such
circumstances, it is often syntactically associated to noun phrases, indicating either (a)
that such noun phrases are in focus position – a function common also to the irrealis
marker (43); or (b) stating the status of the noun phrase as the predicator (under focus) of
the clause, as illustrated by an example of noun phrase coordination, repeated below as

na3.2. Speech-act distinctions
The declarative, interrogative and imperative speech-acts correspond to morphological
and structural distinctions in Apinajé. Declarative clauses have the structural properties
of the types just introduced.
Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure as
simple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may be
introduced by the positional clitic c (alternative form co, depending on the speaker),
which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b).
Information questions are naturally introduced by interrogative pronouns, also at clause
initial position (45.c-d).(45) a. co

‘Which one is sleepy?’There are two strategies for the expression of imperative constructions. One of
them is the use of an irrealis clause whose nominative participant is the addressee of the
command (46.a). This strategy is employed when the speaker is making a request or
giving advice to the addressee. The other strategy is used in more direct commands, and
that is reflected in the structure of the imperative construction (Haiman 1985; Givón
2001: 34-35). Here, no mode marker is employed. The proposition is expressed, instead,
by the bare or inflected form of the verb, depending on its morphosyntactic class. This is
the only construction type in which a transitive verb may display a nominative pattern of
inflection (i.e., it takes the second person prefix, as one might expect of an imperative
context (46.b)).kaj

Verbal clauses have a structure distinct from nominal ones, not only because they –
obviously – are centered around verbal predicators, but especially because they involve
an interesting combination of alignment patterns (cf. section 4).
In the present discussion, I will be employing the notation A, S, and O, proposed in
Dixon (1979, 1994) and later expanded to include E, in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi’s
(2001) framework. The characterization proposed by Dixon for these symbols, as
representing universal syntactic-semantic primitives, has been critiqued by other
linguists. Some of the problems that have been pointed out include (a) inadequacies in the
semantic characterization of these primitives; (b) the fact that their definition is based on
a mixture of semantic and grammatical properties; and (c) that certain languages do not
seem to follow these kinds of patterning, and therefore such primitives should not be
regarded as universal (Mithun and Chafe 1999; Comrie 1978; 1989). Nonetheless, these
symbols are amply used in the literature as a means to refer to core arguments of
transitive and intransitive verbs.
Keeping in mind the problems raised in the literature regarding the theoretical
implications carried by these symbols, in the present discussion I will use them more as
useful mnemonic devices than as strict theoretical constructs. On the other hand, I will
follow the typology proposed in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi (2001) when laying out
patterns of participant marking noted in Apinajé. Once these patterns have been laid out,
I will propose a set of language internal criteria for identifying what relevant grammatical
relations there are in Apinajé (section 4; cf. Dryer 1997).","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"
"PRTRFLX=RP-do=thusAll these interrogative pronouns occur at the beginning of the clause, preceding
the mood marker. Depending on the discourse context, however, they may themselves be
preceded by conjunctions or other categories of that sort. Besides interrogative pronouns,
which introduce information questions, there is a question clitic that introduces polarity
questions in Apinajé; this morpheme is discussed in section IV.3.2.",[183]

The purpose of this dissertation is to present a description of the language spoken by the
Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. The study is based on original
data collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 and
August 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city of
Goiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work is
intended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as further
analysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns as
can possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology,
lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study will
serve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstruction
of the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the better
understanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number of
little-documented South American languages.
The dissertation discusses the principal facts about Apinajé and includes three
appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts and a preliminary dictionary. The
remainder of this chapter presents general information about the Apinajé people,
including some details about their culture and social organization; geographical,
historical, and demographic facts; observations about language contact situations and the2school system available in the communities; as well as details about the genetic affiliation
and previous studies done on the language. Methodological considerations and
information about the database for the study, as well as conventions used in the text, are
also presented in this chapter.
Because most previous studies focus on the phonology of Apinajé, the core of my
research project has been devoted primarily to the study of its grammar. Nonetheless,
facts about its phonology and morphophonology were also captured during my time in
and out of the field. These observations are presented in Chapter II, along with a
discussion of previous literature on Apinajé phonology. Chapter III is an introduction to
Apinajé morphology in which the relevant morphological units and categories are
presented. Chapter IV presents the syntactic and morphosyntactic properties of phrases
and simple clauses. Subordination, serialization and other kinds of complex
constructions are discussed in Chapter V. Chapter VI is the concluding section; it
summarizes the major facts about Apinajé discussed in this work, includes some
language internal hypotheses about the development of certain forms and structures, and
points to areas that deserve further investigation. Illustrative maps regarding the history
and geographical distribution of the Apinajé are found in Appendix A. Appendix B
provides three text samples: a traditional story, a personal experience narrative, and an
instructional narrative. Appendix C, the Apinajé Dictionary, was created out of the
material available the general database I started in 1995, in addition to the items I
collected primarily my the lexicographical project. Appendix D is a list of abbreviations
used in the glosses.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"IntroductionThe present chapter discusses those construction types that encompass more than one
predicator within a single syntactic unit. Arguments are typically shared, but that may not
necessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are the
domains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as a
complex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b)
relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within a
noun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantial
information that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is,
clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectual
meanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) the
comparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, also
constitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by the
types of syntactic strategies described here.
In structural terms, these functional domains are expressed in Apinajé by means
of subordination embedding, parataxis, and serialization. Many cases of
complementation make use of embedding, while in others parataxis is used (Noonan2741985: 44; 55). The alternation between one type of construction and the other within this
domain is determined by the syntactic properties of complement-taking verbs, which are,
in general, of the non-canonical marking type. The alternation between subordination
and parataxis is observable also among the different types of adverbial clauses, although
parataxis is more frequently used.
On the other hand, relative clauses are always embedded inside the noun phrase.
Certain properties commonly found in subordinating constructions, such as the use of the
nonfinite form of verbs, are also necessarily employed in the expression the comparative
of superiority and one type of inchoative construction. The structural properties observed
in the latter cases, which are typologically less common, are crystallized and presumably
result from the diachronic development of source biclausal constructions, in which the
modern main verb was subordinate and the modern postverbal particle was the main verb.
The original main verbs eventually became reanalyzed and grammaticalized as function
words, which they still are in the synchronic stage of the language.
Serialization is a structural strategy often used for the expression of the
progressive and continuous aspects, as well as the more adverbial manner nuance.
The discussion proposed here is intended to be broad enough that it will touch on
the various structural strategies observed in the corpus for the expression of typologically
common functional domains, but it is by no means intended as an exhaustive account of
the inventory of complex predicates and constructions found in Apinajé. That is a task
that requires continued analysis of the data already found and yet to be included in my
database. For the time being, however, the present chapter should serve as a275representative sample. The formal properties of subordination, parataxis, and
serialization in Apinajé are introduced briefly in the remainder of this section; subsequent
sections elaborate on structure in further detail, along with the functional domains
expressed by each structure.
Subordination in Apinajé requires that the relevant verb be inflected for
nonfiniteness. The ergative case marker may or may not mark the A argument,
depending on coreference conditions. In complementation, the distribution of a
subordinate predicate is the same as that of the equivalent nominal. The matrix verb
occurs in final position, postposed to the subordinated element.
Paratactic clauses are finite, displaying the very same structure as independent
simple clauses. Parataxis may require the same-subject or different-subject switchreference markers, where pertinent, and it often involves morphemes from the TAM clitic
inventory.
Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative or
instrumental morpheme) verb  ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form of
verbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the class
of intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serialization
always involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging to
each category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, but
only a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resulting
overall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yielding
awkward or jocose meanings.","[287, 288, 289]"

standPersonal pronouns participate in the expression of mood, a category that is
obligatorily expressed in the clause. First and second person pronouns take the suffix -j
to indicate irrealis mood; thus, two series of speech-act-participant pronouns surface
because of this distinction (106). The irrealis form of the pronoun typically co-occurs
with the mood marker kt in the beginning of the sentence (sections 3.2.2.1 and IV.2.1).
However, if the mood particle is omitted, the presence of the pronoun suffices to indicate
the relevant category (106.b, d).(106) a. Ktpaj

"The definitional criteria put forward by them are seen, admitedly, as types rather
than universal criteria, which may not apply to every language. In regard to the definition
of a grammatical word, however, they offer what they see as a set of universal criteria.
Their list is as follows:A grammatical word consists of a number of grammatical elements which:
(a) always occur together, rather than scattered through the clause (the
criterion of cohesiveness);
(b) occur in a fixed order;
(c) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning. (...)
(d) Morphological processes involved in the formation of words tend to be
non-recursive. That is, one element will not appear twice in a word. (...)
(e) There will be just one inflectional affix per word. (...)
(f) A speaker may pause between words but not within a word. (...)
(g) A word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself (Dixon and
Aikhenvald 2002:19-25).",[102]
"363Grammar: This verb seems to have a transitive counterpart: gr. There is one example
in the database that is indicative of this, but it is not to be confused with the verb gr

is zero third person agreement marking. In attributive constructions, the verb does
take a relational prefix with a third person participant, and that indicates both elements
belong within a single noun phrase. b. This verb has a bivalent counterpart in  akr.

Movement verbs unspecified for direction, such as mõ, te, bra and so on, require the
occurrence in the clause of a movement particle that specifies whether the motion is
centripetal or centrifugal.9 This particle is the positional clitic ma, which occurs in the
same general area of the clause as the other positional clitics.(121) a. Na pa

The category of number comprises the singular, dual and plural distinctions, for nouns
and verbs. Overt morphemes that express these categories are positional clitics – wa
‘dual’ and m ‘plural’ – that occur preposed to nouns and verbs.
Number clitics most often modify person pronouns and person prefixes, occurring
adjacent to the pronominal element they modify. They form a clitic sequence with9The terms centripetal and centrifugal correspond, respectively, to such terms as “venitive” and
“andative”, or “cislocative” and “translocative”, used in the linguistic literature for the expression of
movement/direction notions. The choice for centripetal and centrifugal to be employed throughout the
dissertation follows the terminological tradition of South American literature on Macro-Jê languages.","[185, 186]"

Inflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structure
is restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes may
consist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfiniteness
suffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stress
properties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonological
word, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ is
inflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfinite
form in (b).(5) a. ic-pi

Clitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all of
which display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of the
syllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of the
clause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition as
a whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate the
initial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). The
same is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the
(grammatical) word (9).22As mentioned in footnote 3 of chapter II, throughout this dissertation I will use the symbol “=” to indicate
clitic boundaries, but only in the case of word clitics. Positional (phrase and clause) clitics will be simply86(7) a. pa

sentence: (i) a single modality morpheme occurs at the beginning of the utterance; (ii) no
morphemes intervene between the two clauses involved (note that  ane ‘do thus’
constitutes a single predicate); and (iii) the intonation pattern treats the two as a single
unit. (The absence of a modality marker in (92.c) is due to the imperative speech act.) In
addition, in the case of the periphrastic causatives in (92) the two clauses are linked by
the fact that they share an argument: the object of  ane ‘do thus’ is coreferential with
the causee, which is expressed by the independent pronoun placed at the beginning of the
result clause. Now consider the example in (93).(93) na rp ri

‘The dog caused me to spill my juice (i. e. it ran across my way, I tripped on it and

presence of the conjunction suggests that in (93) the clauses expressing cause and result
are not as formally bound to each other as those in (92). On the other hand, both clauses
fall under the scope of the same modality marker, which is confirmation that they still
constitute a single sentence.
The structural differences observed in (92-93) correlate with slight semantic
distinctions. In both (92-93) the causers are animate beings, except that in the former the
causation may be understood as intentional whereas in the latter the causer is unaware of
its acts. This nuance is motivated by the fact that the causer in (92) holds a higher degree
of volition for it is a human (or human-like) being.

probably the fact that the higher agent here is an event, and not a participant. A more264natural way for expressing a meaning similar to that of (94) would be with a different

ane as the causative predicator plus a subsequent clause encoding the result. The result
clause is not a complement of  ane but rather in a paratactic relation with it (literally:
“you did me this way, I [V]”); in addition, the accusative argument of  ane ‘do thus’
must be coreferential with the first argument of the result clause. Differences in the
structure of a periphrastic causative correlate with the human-ness/volitionality of the
causer: if that argument is not an inherently volitional being, the first clause is linked to
the second one by the conjunction ne.","[275, 276, 277, 278]"

Onishi (2001) observes that languages with clear syntactic derivations have
constraints on many clause-linking devices; for instance, they may required that one of
two coreferential arguments be deleted in such contexts (what Dixon 1994 terms “pivot
conditions”). Languages in which semantic roles dominate the process typically lack
these constraints, whereas languages with noncanonically marked arguments have an271intermediary status. In general, noncanonically marked A/S are more likely to control
pivot constraints than to become targets of such constraints. Some languages allow
predicates with non-canonically marked A/S to occur both in the main and the
complement clause. In general, restrictions on the occurrence of predicates with
noncanonically marked arguments are more likely to apply when they function as target
of coreferential deletion in the complement clause.
In Apinajé, most, if not all complement-taking verbs are noncanonical predicates.
There seems to be no restrictions as far as the occurrence of noncanonical predicates in
complement positions either. Under coreferentiality conditions, all relevant arguments are
marked with person prefixes on the verb and the postposition, as applicable. However, no
independent pronouns occur in the subordinate clause, that is, there is A/S coreferential
deletion. On the other hand, when there is no coreferentiality between A and/or S of both
clauses, the occurrence of the ergative marker in the subordinate clause is obligatory.(107) a. i-m

At this point, sufficient evidence has converged to argue for a convincing
grammatical category of Subject, a morphologically heterogeneous category that is united
by syntactic behaviors. In future research, this category might become even stronger, as
the database lacked examples of noncanonical predicates with noun phrase coordination,
in sentences that engage the switch reference system, and in valency-changing
derivations. In any of these, the noncanonical A arguments might share yet one more
syntactic pattern with the canonical A.
In contrast, the search for syntactic properties that distinguish the categories of
Direct Object and Indirect Object was unsuccessful, leaving a potentially interesting topic
for future research.","[284, 285, 286]"
"5.1. Ri constructions
The particle ri serves as an indicator of sequential relation between events, as described
by clauses in a sentence. The particle appears in two kinds of constructions: the first
translates as ‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’; the second translates as ‘before SBJ X, SBJ will
Y’.",[303]
"3.1.3. Postpositions
Postpositions constitute a (rather large) closed class in Apinajé. Postpositions occur
postposed to their object noun phrase or, in the absence of an overt dependent noun
phrase, they inflect for person in the same way as Verbs and Nouns. The set of person
prefixes used is the same for all three lexical categories, as is the complementary
distribution between prefixes and noun phrases.
The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at odds
with the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set of
standard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical than
lexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem more
like postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here
“relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions in
Apinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfway
open” class.
Relator nouns are lexemes whose semantics extend metaphorically into
grammatical meanings related to space orientation and position. Typically, relator nouns
are body part terms, or part-whole terms which pattern as inalienable nouns in languages
that make this distinction (DeLancey 1997). This kind of diachronic development is140fairly common crosslinguistically. In Apinajé, it is possible to observe, at the synchronic
level, hints of the grammaticalization of some nouns into postpositions, as will be seen.
Although there seems to exist a tendency for postpositions to evolve from nouns
in Apinajé, there is at least one instance of a postposition having a verb as its diachronic
source. That is the case of the instrumental postposition  and the verb  ‘do’ (Oliveira
1998).
The set of grammatical postpositions and some selected relator nouns are
introduced in what follows.","[153, 154]"
"1971. Criteria for the establishment of constituency
Phrasal and clausal constituency are detectable in Apinajé according to three types of
criteria: prosodic, morphological, and distributional. By prosodic criteria I mean (a) the
intonation contour that characterizes phrases and larger constituents as internally
cohesive units, and (b) stress patterns characteristic of such combination of elements.
Another phonological criterion that may help identify the boundaries of a constituent is
the echo-vowel phenomenon, which is indicative of final boundary and must be followed
by silence (sections II.4.5 and III.2.1). This criterion, although helpful, is not as
specifically indicative of constituency, since it may delimit a word said at random, that is,
one that is not necessarily in a constituency relation with some other element (a word
uttered as a citation form, for instance).
The main morphological criterion to be considered is the use of relational prefixes
(section III.4.1.2), which are precisely the overt grammatical marking of phrasal
constituency in Jê (and other Macro-Jê) languages. Relational prefixes are common to
noun, verb, and postpositional phrases, and indicate contiguity between the head of a
phrase and its dependent. Such contiguity is one of the clues for the constituency relation
between the elements, and a violation of this state of affairs has overt grammatical
repercussions as well, such as the use of specific person prefixes for head marking
(section 2.3). Even though the relational prefix strategy indicates the bond between twoword units, and thus would not seem as useful for larger units, it may reccur in sequences
of more than two words thus indicating relevant constituency relations among the units
that participate in the hierarchy (provided the elements involved are vowel-initial).","[210, 211]"

hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be standing’, but with the semantics of kue

mere coincidences; however, there has been at least one instance in which I tried to elicit
a sentence that included a clausal complement in subject position, and speakers offered
paratactic clauses, instead.",[290]

The ergative markers t and kt are positional clitics that introduce the subordinated
ergative clause; they indicate the initial boundary of the clause. The clitic t is used with

Spike GildeaThe dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spoken
by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the core
facts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogical
perspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts
and a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternative
interpretation for the inventory of phonemes as compared to earlier analyses, pointing to
phonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findings
regarding the historical development of the language. Apinajé morphemes are typically
monosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression of
grammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages.
Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especially
with respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs andv
Postpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterized
morphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are either
semantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal or
semantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituency
constitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions,
and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitives
and descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal personmarking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructions
include verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking a
characteristic of subordinate clauses.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
"3.3.2. Noncanonical predicates
The typology of argument marking proposed in Onishi (2001) departs from the
assumption that all languages include transitive and intransitive clauses, and that the core
arguments of these clauses – A, S, O – will be expressed according to certain canonical
patterns noticeable in that given language. Additionally, languages will also display a set
of predicators that include what he terms “extensions to the core”, which he indicates231with the symbol E (which stands for “extended argument”, following Dixon 1994). The
“core” plus “extensions” result in four clause types, displayed schematically below (from
Onishi 2001: 2), in which core arguments may be marked in the most diverse ways,
crosslinguistically.","[244, 245]"

syntactic context; in this sense, they are syntactically bound (details in section 3.2.2).
The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criteria
listed in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internally
cohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically,
because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component92morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word clitics
always occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word final
boundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thus
indicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word without
interruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort,
which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical word
can constitute a complete utterance by itself.","[105, 106]"

"277As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression of
complementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. The
subordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in final
position, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Since
the complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking one
of the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is often
the case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,
when A is the noncanonically marked argument.
The examples in (1.a-d) illustrate the parallel distribution of clausal complements
with that of an O noun phrase. The noun phrase in (1.a) occurs immediately preposed to
the matrix verb (which therefore displays its relational prefix-equivalent form pubu) and
postposed to the dative phrase that indicates the A argument of the verb in question.
In (1.b-c), the subordinate verbs are transitive and intransitive, respectively; the
internal structure of the clausal complement thus reflects this difference in transitivity.
Comparing (1.b) with (1.d), in which both subordinate verbs are transitive, it is possible
to notice the presence of the ergative marker in the latter, but not in the former. The
ergative case marker in (1.d) indicates that the A argument of the subordinate verb is not
coreferential with that of the matrix. The subordinate A arguments is thus overtly
expressed in the embedded clause.(1) a. nai-m [kuke]

verb is slightly different than that of (1). In (1), the matrix verb stem follows a transitive
pattern of inflection, whereas in (2), the matrix verb follows a descriptive pattern of
inflection. That is, in (2), the first argument of the matrix verb is indicated by both an
independent pronoun (when it occurs) and the person prefix attached to the verb. In its
turn, the dative marker attaches to the constituent that refers to the (noncanonically
marked) O argument of the verb in question. When that constituent is a clausal
complement, the dative marker follows the final boundary of the subordinate clause.","[290, 291, 292]"
"232The noncanonical marking of core arguments is understood here, with Onishi
(2001), as those patterns that deviate from the standard patterns of argument marking
used in a given language. In the case of Apinajé, the canonical pattern is the use of free
pronouns to indicate SA/SO/A (nominative pattern), and bound person markers to indicate
SO/O (absolutive pattern). Noncanonical marking in Apinajé then involves the use ofvarious postpositions for the expression of what appear to be core arguments, that is,
participants that are obligatorily required by verbs.
In the remainder of this section, I will tentatively depart from the assumption that
the patterns of Apinajé laid out here involve the noncanonical marking of core
arguments; at this point, this assumption is based simply on (a) the frequency and
consistency with which certain postpositions come associated with certain verbs; and (b)
the fact that these combinations sometimes result in significantly distinct meanings from
those of the base verbs, as if in a derivational relation. Supporting grammatical evidence
is presented in section 4.
Noncanonical marking in Apinajé is noticeable with verbs of cognition, emotion,
utterance, and sensation, among others. The patterns observed with these verbs all depart
from the basic canonical patterns of argument marking and involve many sorts of
postpositions – from locative, to dative, to instrumental to ergative. The semantic subcategorization of such predicators corresponds somewhat to the kinds of postpositions
used, but not necessarily so.","[245, 246]"
"IntroductionFor the unacquainted observer, Apinajé may appear as a morphologically plain language
of the analytic kind, consisting of rather short words, and having much of its grammatical
categories expressed by function words rather than bound morphemes. That impression
is justified: Apinajé morphemes are monosyllabic indeed, and the grammatical
categories found in the language are often expressed by function words that may or may
not be phonologically dependent, or by syntactic constructions that often times employ a
subset of these very function words.
However, Apinajé words are not necessarily monomorphemic – nor
monosyllabic, for that matter. Words consisting of more than one syllable usually consist
of as many morphemes; and Apinajé morphology is rather rich, especially in regard to
content words. Thus, Apinajé may be typologically characterized as an agglutinating
language of analytic spirit, with compounding and prefixation playing major roles in
word formation. The predominance of prefixes over suffixes is reminiscent of the fact
that Apinajé is a head final language: syntactically dependent elements serve as a
diachronic source for phonologically dependent ones.",[95]

O VVerb phrase/clause coordination. Verb phrase coordination basically coincides with
clausal coordination. The strategies employed include the conjunctions ne and um,
which have the additional function of a switch reference system; or simply the
juxtaposition of phrases. The distribution of these markers is also ruled by the contrast
between speech-act and third person participants.
Ne indicates same subject (see discussion of grammatical relations in section 4)
and is used regardless of person distinctions (38.a-b). When there is switch in reference
such that both referents are third person participants, the conjunction um is employed
(38.c). When there is switch of reference to a speech-act participant, however, there is
juxtaposition of clauses such that the second referent is introduced by a free pronoun
(38.d).

possessed by ic-kra in the examples below. Acwj behaves morphosyntactically as an
inalienable noun. It takes person prefixes and may be followed by determiners such as
the definite marker ja. In other words, not only does it belong in the noun phrase, it
heads it (38). The adverbial mne ‘also’, on the other hand, is a sentence-level operator
with rather flexible distribution in the clause, as will be seen later on.
Thus, the strategies presented in (39-40) are not exactly instances of noun phrase,
but clausal coordination. Further details on this subject are in section (4).","[234, 235, 236]"

The present dissertation is deliberately a descriptive study. It has a functional and
typological orientation, and includes some diachronic hypotheses for the interpretation of
certain blurry domains. It is meant to serve as a useful source for readers interested in
learning about the Apinajé language, researchers interested in typological studies, and
linguists engaged in the study of Macro-Jê languages, especially in historicalcomparative studies for the reconstruction of Proto-Jê. For these reasons, I have
deliberately avoided formal approaches to language, which sometimes obscure the
explanation of the data and usually tend to become rapidly outdated.
In the remainder of this section, I comment on fieldwork conditions and on
methodological strategies for data collection that I have applied during my research.
My initial interviews with Apinajé speakers occurred in Goiânia, Goiás State. I
met Amci Creuza de Souza Fernandes and Dioro Aparecida Laranja in the second half of301995. Dioro had brought her son to Goiânia for medical attention and they were staying
at the Casa do Índio, a hostel unit provided by FUNAI for patients and their caregivers.
I had heard about Dioro’s party through the staff of the local FUNAI office, so I
proceeded to visit with them at the Casa do Índio. We eventually made arrangements for
a recorded interview at the Setor de Etnolingüística of the Museu Antropológico
(University of Goiás) to take place a few days later. In that interview and others that
followed we recorded word lists and short texts, which I used for preliminary
phonological and grammatical analysis. Those meetings occurred in October 1995.
Two weeks later Amci and Dioro received me at the village of São José for a six
week fieldwork session. I decided from the outset to work most directly with the women.
I accompanied them in their daily tasks such that we had plenty to talk about during
recording and interview sessions. I collected most personal experience narratives in that
way. For a beginner in the study of the language, having been present at the events
narrated allowed me to capture the semantic nuances of certain utterances more promptly
than I would have otherwise.
My main consultants turned out to be Amci (Dir) and Ir Rita Dias Laranja, who
was introduced to me by Amci herself. Other major consultants I met in that first session
were Kojkoti Iraci Dias (Dkr) and Grri Júlia Estêvão (Dada, my adoptive mother), the
daughter of late Velho Estêvão, former Chief of São José.
Besides contributing personal experience narratives to the database, Dkr took it
upon herself to teach me how to do things properly while in Apinajé country (see Text II,31Appendix B). Grri contributed a significant part of the traditional narratives in my
database over the years. From her storytelling comes the version of the Apinajé creation
myth found in Appendix B (Text I). Another version of the myth, as well as other
traditional stories were provided by Gr o Júlia Corredor; recording sessions with Gr o
started in 1999.
The interviews I conducted with male speakers were usually mediated by Amci
and Ir, although in certain cases I made the arrangements with the speakers myself.
That was the case with Daniel Laranja Rodrigues (Kiki), who contributed a procedural
narrative as well as elicited data. Vame Miguel Fernandes provided a number of
traditional stories, and Bogo Moisés Dias Roxo (Velho Moisés) contributed valuable
information on animals, plants, and traditional weapons and crafts, which was used in the
lexicographical project. Interviews with Vame started in 1997, and those with Bogo
occurred in 2000.
In 2004, I also conducted interviews with a male speaker, who wishes to remain
anonymous, about general information on the villages and the Apinajé school system; he
also aided me in some follow up work on the phonology of the language.
The transcription and translation of most narratives were done with the assistance
of Amci and Ir. They also contributed some texts of their own (testimonies and
instructional narratives – see Text III, Appendix B) and the bulk of the elicited material32found in the database.19 Although these women are illiterate, their keen linguistic
awareness and passionate interest in their native language and culture proved essential for
the development of the project.
Besides the main consultants introduced above, other speakers — men, women,
and children — contributed to the database either through scheduled interviews, informal
conversations or in a more passive manner, as I took linguistic notes on the way they
spoke with one another.
The database consists of about ten hours of recorded material and various books
of elicited data. It includes some additional three hours of songs in Krikatí recorded live
at the B rkape festival that took place in São José in mid 2000;20 those songs are
permeated with conversations and ceremonial forms of speech in Apinajé. It was on that
same occasion that I recorded a personal experience narrative by Irptsi Maria Barbosa,
Amci’s mother, who passed away in 2002.
About six and a half hours of the recorded texts have been transcribed and
analyzed, with their transcriptions and analyses having undergone at least one round of
revisions. The remainder of the recordings has not been transcribed yet.
Between 1995 and 2000, I worked with speakers in and out of the field, although I
spent more time conducting my research in the indigenous land itself. The time I spent1920Kojkoti (Dkr) assisted in a few transcription sessions as well.","[43, 44, 45, 46]"

cl. phrase-final clitic, nominalizer of agent. Grammar: This morpheme occurs in
relative clauses indicating the relativized noun, which may be a subject or object.
Structurally, it is placed at the end of the relative clause and is followed by the definite
article ja, or another determiner. Its occurrence in this context appears to be optional.

n.al. rain.
n.al.cmp. lightning. (da=a-cet ‘rain=dtrz-burn’). Alternate form: da acen. Grammar:
The presence of the formative a- in this word makes it comparable to words such as
amgr ‘drought; dry season’. In both cases, the base of the word is a descriptive verb.
It might even be possible to include awjakr in the equation. Ex.: Da acet ka:pri. ‘It’s

v.dscr. bad; ugly; badly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=p-uduj; alternate
form: çmduj. Nonfinite form: same. Alternate form: puduju/mduju; this form does not
occur in nonfinite position. Grammar: This verb may occur with the clause-final clitic
ne, which expresses temporary state or condition, in this context. Ex.: Ata na mduju.
‘This one (over there) is bad.’ Ata na m mduj tjc kumrc. ‘That one is really
mean!’ Na pa icpuduju. ‘I’m ugly/mean/sickly.’ Na pa icpuduj ne. ‘I look ugly/am

throw away.’ See mduj.
v.tr.noncan. tie; fasten. Inflectional pattern: OE=m e; no relational prefix. Grammar:
a. One piece of evidence of the absence of a relational prefix for this verb is the
ungrammatical form *aje (for “tie [it] up!”). b. When there is a beneficiary, the clause
will contain two dative-marked nominals: one being the beneficiary and the other the
dative-marked, extended O. c. This verb contrasts with pr, katpr in that it may have
a participial reading with no change in form. Nonfinite form: same. Ex.: Kt paj pi
m e. ‘I’ll fasten the lumber.’ Im iõ boc m e. ‘Tie my cow for me, will you?’ Km
e! ‘Tie it up!’ B pip muj, na m ra km e. ‘That drunk man, they’ve tied him up.’
B na ra km e . ‘The man is tied up, sitting.’ Pa na pa m b jaja m e  ca. ‘I’m

n.al.cmp. fishing line. (ce=c ‘tie=INSTR.NMLZ’)
v.dscr. lie; deceive; cheat; pretend. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: S=c=ec.
Nonfinite form: et. Grammar: This verb may occur with the dative postposition m in
a noncanonical pattern of argument marking; in such cases the inflectional pattern is as
follows: EO=m S=c=ec.

"100Benveniste 1967) call attention to the fact that compounds display internal syntactic
structuring, among other syntactic properties; whereas those that argue for the affiliation
of compounds to the domain of morphology (e.g. Matthews 1993) point out that these
complex elements name (rather than describe) entities, properties or events, and that they
are learned as a single units, i.e. lexemes, by young speakers. The approach adopted here
for the analysis of the Apinajé data is one which takes into consideration both views. I
will seek to justify an analysis of compounds as morphologically complex lexical units
by providing criteria that distinguish them from ordinary phrases, but I will also
demonstrate the possible combinations of basic elements, and how these elements may
form constituents within the compound itself.
Apinajé compounds consist of more than one putative phonological word, since
they consist of more than one root. They also have an internal structural organization
whereby the stress patterns of each putative phonological word must be combined, and
thus constitute what I term here a phonological phrase. Compounds are phonological
phrases that correspond to grammatical words. That they are words (not syntactic
phrases) can be established on the grounds of internal cohesion and conventionalized
meaning (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 19), as well as prosodic properties and certain
phonological processes.
For the most part, Apinajé compounds are not characterized by any obvious stress
shifts, as compared to grammatical phrase patterns. However, the phonological phrase
that results from compounding displays a particular, cohesive intonation pattern, that
comes accompanied by a rearrangement of the overall stress pattern of the word. It can101be described, in the terms of Hayes (1995), as an iambic stress pattern, parsed from right
to left, with final prominence, foot construction being iterative. These phonological
properties of compounds are illustrated below, after their structural properties have been
introduced.
Compound stems are verbs and nouns. In terms of internal structure, these
grammatical words may involve nominal, verbal and postpositional bases, as well as
clitics.","[113, 114, 115]"
"Word classesThe present section is about the content and function words of Apinajé: how they
categorize and how this categorization is expressed in structural terms, among other
things. The discussion is organized in terms of lexical categories and grammatical
categories. Lexical categories include nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbials –
mostly open classes (section 3.1). Grammatical categories are pronouns and clitics that
encode various grammatical meanings – words that consitute closed classes (section 3.2).",[120]
"Periphrastic causative. The periphrastic causative construction encodes indirect
causation; in this context the construction  ane expresses the cause, and a subsequent
clause encodes the result. Unlike languages like English where the causative predicator
takes an embeded complement clause, in the periphrastic causative construction of
Apinajé, the clause encoding the resulting situation is not structurally an embedded
complement, but rather a different-subject clause in a paratactic relation with the clause
that expresses the causation ((92) see chapter V for other complex constructions).",[275]

throw someone; cause someone to fall. 3. serve oneself to food of a single kind,
usually presented in a single container (e.g. a stew). 4. throw away. 5. name someone.
Inflectional pattern: O=me; no relational prefix. Nonfinite form: same. Grammar: The
use of this verb with the sense of ‘serve food’ contrasts with the verb re, with the same
sense, in that the former requires the quantifier kw to determine meõ, whereas the
latter occurs without the quantifier. One could describe the distinction also in terms of
mass versus count objects. Ex.: Ka na ka i¯me) ‘You threw me.’ Te ne amim meõ
kw me. ‘Go help yourself to the food.’ Me bra ne me amim meõ kw me. ‘Go over
there and help yourselves to some food.’ M kadc duj ja mari ame. ‘This spoiled

v.intr. come; go. Nonfinite form: S=mõ; alternate form: mõr. Semantics: The semantic
contrast between this verb and te apparently has to do with the number of participants,
mõ being the plural and te the singular counterpart. Grammar: a. The root may
cooccur with the directional/movement particle ma in the clause; the combination of
particle and verb root means ‘go’. If the particle is absent in the clause, the verb root
means ‘come’. See te, bra; ma. b. This root may be used with the morpheme  in
what appears to be a transitive verb compound, ‘bring/take’. c. This root may be used
in V mõ (serial) constructions, basically expressing progressive or inchoative aspects;
it contrasts with te in this respect, in that the latter may not be used in many of these
constructions. In such cases, mõ appears to have acquired a more grammaticalized
meaning, whereas te is understood more literally, which makes its use inadequate.
v.intr. dive. Nonfinite form and inflectional pattern: S=mrõ. Grammar: This verb
cannot take the derivational morpheme -ji (*mrõmji), unless it is used as a transitive
verb: kr mrõmji ‘one how likes to sink her/his head’. Ex.: Na pa mrõ. ‘I dove.’ Na
pa imrõ rac kumrc. ‘I dove for a long time.’ Na pa imrõ tjc ne. ‘I dove hard (e.g.
jumping off from a high spot and splashing water all over when reaching the body of
water.)’

v.intr. 1. lie down; lie in horizontal position (of one or a pair of objects or people). 2.
lie at the bottom of a container (e.g. starch). Nonfinite form: S=nõr. Grammar: The
verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that
the former seem to have a more flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of
the absolutive, than the latter. It is possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even
though these verbs refer basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are
often not found with singular absolutives.

n.inal. belly. Inflectional pattern and relational prefix: PSSR=-õ. See u. Semantic
note: As explained by speakers, the formative õ refers to inner body parts: the guts, the
intestines, the throat (seen from within), etc. Grammar: This noun changes form
somewhat when inflected for second person; in that case, the form is atu (a-t-u ‘2-RPbelly’, presumably). It is not yet clear why there is such variation. Ex.: Di ata na km
õ c prm. ‘This woman over there always has intestinal problems.’

"3.4.2. Equative predicates244Equative predicates functionally express a one-to-one identity relation between two
specific, referential entities, as in “I am Sam” or “I am your sister.” A structural
difference between the juxtaposition construction employed here and the one expressing
proper inclusion is that here a personal prefix on the predicate noun indicates the
possessor, and not the subject. The subject is encoded rather by a free pronoun, although
its order relative to the mood marker remains reversed as compared to verbal clauses: the
pronoun occurs clause-initially, and not in second position.(65) a. pa

predicator is not coreferential with the subject of the clause.","[257, 258]"
