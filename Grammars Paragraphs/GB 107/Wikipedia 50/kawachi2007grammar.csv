the other speaker has said and to answer a question affirmatively (in each of the two sets
of conversations in (3.503) and (3.504), the person B can answer the person A’s question

"4.2.2.3.7 Negative Suffixes
Unlike the negative proclitic di= (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4), which occurs at the
beginning of a constituent in the focus position and is used to negate various types of
constituents, the negative suffix -kki is always attached to the verb of a subordinate
clause. Conversely, any subordinate clause has to be negated with this suffix.
The negative suffix -kki is used to negate the verb of a relative clause, as in
(4.236) and (4.237). It immediately follows the verb and precedes the head of the relative
clause.",[453]

This suffix attaches to the verb at the end of a conditional clause. There are two
types of conditional constructions. In one, where the condition is realizable, the verb in
the conditional clause is in the simple perfect and that in the main clause is in the
imperfect, as in (4.252).","[458, 459]"
"• Highland East Cushitic languages vs. the rest of the East Cushitic languages
Fleming and Bender (1976: 42) report a strong influence on the HEC languages
from Omotic languages due to language contact. According to them, like Omotic
languages, the HEC languages have glottalized consonants but lack pharyngeals, whereas
other East Cushitic languages tend to lack glottalized consonants but have pharyngeals.
Hetzron (1980) also suggests a possibility of the negative proclitic di= and the locational
noun-phrase clitic =wa in the HEC languages as instances of the influence from Omotic
languages.
If Sidaama is compared with the most studied East Cushitic language, Somali
(e.g., Saeed 1993[1986]), there seem to be many clear differences between these two
languages. First, Somali has what are called “indicator particles” (Tucker 1966: 541,Andrzejewski 1975, Livnat 1983), while Sidaama lacks them. Second, Somali has
definite articles, interrogatives, and demonstratives that are suffixed to nouns (Saeed
1993[1986]: 120-122, 160-165), whereas Sidaama has adnominal demonstratives, which- 10 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 1: Introduction 11are independent words, and lacks definite articles and interrogative suffixes. Third,
unlike Sidaama, Somali has prepositions (Saeed 1993[1986]: 201-214).","[31, 32]"
"3.1.5 Other Open-Class Forms
There is a group of open-class forms that cannot be classified into any of the

Examples of idiomatic expressions with y- and ass- are shown in (3.191a) and
(3.191b) below, respectively. As in the above examples, expressions with y- and ass- are
often paired with each other and show contrast in causativity (y-versions: non-causative
vs. ass-versions: causative), though there are a small number of y- expressions that have
no ass- counterparts (e.g., araji y- ‘to become bored’, leessi y- ‘to become dusk’). The
preceding form usually ends in i, as in (3.191), and there are some expressions that
contain reduplicated forms, as in (3.192). There are various meanings that such idiomatic
expressions with y- and ass- tend to convey: posture change, self-contained motion,
emotion, etc., though such meanings do not necessarily require expressions with y- and
ass- to be used.","[195, 196, 197]"

The negation test reveals the ambiguity of a sentence like (6.29) (repeated below
as (6.36)), which could be taken as an instance of the manner/concomitance construction
or the temporal inclusion construction. The main verb of (6.29) (e’- ‘to enter’) is negated
in (6.37). When (6.37) is interpreted as an instance of the manner/concomitance
construction, as in (6.37-1), the occurrences of the event components expressed by the
two verbs are both negated. On the other hand, when (6.37) is interpreted as an instance
of the temporal inclusion construction, as in (6.37-2), only the occurrence of the event
component expressed by V2 is negated.(6.36) kaase

(The ball neither rolled nor entered the house.)
‘While the ball was rolling, it did not enter the house.’The negation test does not seem to be a reliable test for the clause-hood of the
verbs in the temporal sequence V1-V2 construction with the connective suffix -e. In
most cases, the negation of V2 has scope over both of the event components, as in (6.381)-(6.44-1). Nevertheless, a difference usually emerges in an alternative interpretation
depending on whether or not the V1 of this construction is a Manner verb. When V1
expresses a Manner of the translational motion of the V2 in this construction, the
negation of V2 can often also be interpreted as resulting in the negation of only the
Manner, as shown in (6.38-2) and (6.39-2).10 On the other hand, when the V1 of the9However, another possible interpretation of (6.37) is the negation of the first event component: ‘The ball
entered the house not in the manner of rolling (but in some other manner)’.

‘He swam in the river, but did not run on the field.’However, it is not clear how the difference of the alternative interpretations due to the
scope of negation is related to the single-clause-hood of the construction. Furthermore,
there are cases where the above generalization does not work. For example, there are
cases like (6.45) where the negation of V2 in a temporal sequence construction using a
manner verb as V1 can have a scope over both verbs, or otherwise over V2, rather than
over V1.(6.45) kaase

"However, the difference is not as clear as the difference between themanner/concomitance and extended causation constructions and the temporal inclusion
construction.
The negation test, which is often employed in the literature (e.g., Noonan 1985,
Kelly and Melinger eds. 2001: 86-97, Bohnemeyer et al. in press) to examine clausehood, seems to be able to serve as a reliable diagnostic test for distinguishing the
manner/concomitance and extended causation constructions from the temporal inclusion
construction in Sidaama. The negation test determines whether two verbs in a multi-verb
construction constitute a single clause or two clauses on the basis of the scope of
negation, specifically, whether or not the negation of the main verb has scope over the
occurrence of both of the event components that the two verbs express.

the manner/concomitance and the event component expressed by V2. An example of a
manner/concomitance construction whose V2 is negated is shown in (6.33) (this is

there are case suprafixes (specifically, the accusative, oblique, and genitive case
suprafixes). There are no prefixes in this language (though the negative proclitic di=

there are those verb suffixes whose final vowel segments are always accented (or which
constitute the final vowel segments of words by themselves and are always accented).
Such suffixes include: simple perfect (3SG.M: -i, 3SG.F/3PL: -u, 2PL: -i), present perfect
(3: -ino, 2PL: -oonni), imperfect (3: -anno, 2PL: -anni), and connective (-e: all
persons/numbers/genders) suffixes (Hudson 1976: 248). Thus, a verb with the third
person singular simple perfect suffix contrasts with a verb with the second-person
singular imperative suffix, as in (2.52) and (2.53), and a verb with the third-person
singular present-perfect suffix contrasts with a verb with the first-person plural
imperative suffix, as in (2.54) and (2.55).(2.52) ha’r-ø-i.

Intonation toward the end of a sentence differentiates sentence types in Sidaama.
A Sidaama sentence normally ends in a suffixed verb or the predicating noun-phrase
clitic (=ho/=te or =ti). Non-WH-questions are usually only indicated by an intonation
pattern in the final or semi-final word of a sentence different from that in its declarative
counterpart (Greenberg 1963: universal 8).
In a declarative sentence ending in a suffixed verb, high pitch occurs on the
second to the last vowel segment of the word-final, main verb, and the pitch falls down at
its final vowel segment, which has low pitch, as long as the suffix has penultimate high
pitch accent.(2.56) ani

(3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), present perfect (3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), imperfect

a pause, especially because some case forms are morphologically identical (specifically,
the nominative and the accusative of a feminine noun, the genitive and dative/locative of
an unmodified feminine common noun, and the genitive and nominative of a masculine
noun) and the person/number/gender of the subject can be indicated by the verb suffix
alone, rather than the subject being expressed as independent nouns or pronouns. For
example, each pair of sentences in (2.75) and (2.76), which look morphologically
identical, differ in the locations where pauses as well as high pitch accents are placed.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"

In fast speech, when the negative proclitic di= (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.4)
immediately precedes a clause-final predicative or preverbal constituent beginning in a
vowel, the /i/ of the clitic is optionally dropped, and when this clitic precedes a verb
beginning in /h/, the /h/ as well as the /i/ of the clitic is dropped (Teferra 2000: 26-27). In
these cases, the vowel right after the reduced clitic d= bears a high pitch. (2.30) shows
examples where this clitic and verbs are fused.","[75, 76, 77]"

"(Talmy 2000b: 30)(Talmy 2000b: 217)- 688 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 689In (6.1a), the ball’s going down the hill and the ball’s rolling are expressed in two
different clauses; the relation between the two is determined by the so-called “present
participle” construction. In (6.1b), almost the same content as (6.1a) is expressed as a
unitary event in a single clause, where the verb rolled expresses the Manner of motion
and the prepositional phrase the path of motion as well as the ground object. In (6.2a),
the candle’s going out is expressed in a separate clause from something blowing on the
candle, and the relation between the two is indicated by the construction with the
conjunction because, which connects the two clauses. (6.2b), on the other hand, treats
approximately the same content as unitary, and expresses it with a single clause, where
the verb expresses the Cause of the state-change event and the satellite the final state
resulting from the state-change.
Like other researchers, Talmy notes structural similarities between motion events
and state-change events, but from a rather different perspective. Talmy (1991, 2000b)
uses the term “macro-event” to refer to an event like (6.1) and (6.2), namely “a complex
event that can be conceptually integrated into a unitary event expressable in some
languages by a single clause” (Talmy 2000b: 220). Although languages can differ as to
what can be conceptualized as single events and expressed in a single clause, there is a
class of events that tend to be recurrently conceptualized as macro-events and expressed
in single clauses across languages.
In both types of events, motion and state-change, the macro-event is made up of a
framing event (a main event), a co-event (a subordinate event), and the supporting
relation. In (6.1), the framing event is the ball’s motion of going down the hill, the coevent is the ball’s rolling, and the supporting relation is a Manner of motion in which the
- 689 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 690ball changes its location. In (6.2), the framing event is the candle’s state-change of going
out, the co-event is something blowing on the candle, and the supporting relation is a
causal relation in which something blowing on the candle causes it to go out.
The framing event, which is the main event of a macro-event, constitutes the
schematic core of the macro-event, and has a framing function relative to the macroevent. It “provides for the whole macro-event the overarching conceptual framework or
reference frame within which the other included activities are conceived of as taking
place”, and represents “the upshot – relative to the whole macro-event” in the sense that
“it is the framing event that is asserted in a positive declarative sentence, that is denied
under negation, that is demanded in an imperative, and that is asked about in an
interrogative”; moreover, it determines the overall temporal and spatial frameworks, the
argument structure, and the syntactic complement structure (Talmy 2000b: 219).
The framing event consists of the following four components: (i) a figural entity,
(ii) a ground entity, (iii) an activation process, and (iv) an association function. The
figural entity is an entity that has an unknown particular value to be determined and to
which attention is directed. The ground entity is a reference-point entity with respect to
which the figural entity is characterized. The activation process, which has two values,
transition and fixity, determines the dynamism of the event. In the case of a motion
event, the two values are motion and locatedness (stationariness), and in the case of a
state-change event, they are a change in a property of an entity and a stasis in the
property. The association function, which relates a figural entity to a ground entity,
constitutes the core schema of the framing event (sometimes together with the ground).
For example, in (6.1b) (repeated below as (6.3) with the hill in parentheses), the figural
- 690 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 691entity is the ball, the ground entity is the hill, the activation process is transition,
specifically motion, and the association function is the path along which the ball moves.
In (6.2b) (repeated below as (6.4)), the figural entity is the candle, the ground entity is the
candle’s property of being extinguished, the activation process is transition, specifically
change, and the association function is entry into a new state.","[709, 710, 711, 712]"

Sidaama has clitics, one of which is a proclitic (the negative proclitic) (section
3.2.2.4) and all the others of which are enclitics (noun-phrase enclitics and conjunctive
enclitics) (sections 3.2.2.1-3.2.2.3 and 3.2.2.5).","[259, 260]"

(section 3.2.2.4), when the negative proclitic di= attaches to a preverbal constituent, the constituent is
contrasted with other elements in a paradigmatic relation with it, as in (i).

possessor noun or pronoun precedes the possessum noun. This is shown in (5.61).","[532, 533]"

Professor Jürgen BohnemeyeriiiDedicated to my family,
especially my wife and childrenivAck nowled gmentsFirst of all, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Dr. Abebayehu Aemero
Tekleselassie (PhD in educational administration), my Sidaama native speaker consultant
and teacher (from the Baansa district of the Sidaama zone in Southern Ethiopia), who has
provided me with data constantly over the years. He and I have had approximately one
thousand hours of consultation sessions so far. I owe most parts of my dissertation to his
friendship, his encouragement, and his patience as well as his Sidaama data and his
insightful comments on them. If I had not met him at the party for the Field Methods
class in Buffalo in 2001, I would not be able to be working on Sidaama, nor would I have
been able to write this dissertation.
Before I started to study Sidaama, I had worked on several different languages
(excluding English and Japanese) with their native speakers, hoping that I might be
inspired enough by one of those languages to write a dissertation. However, for various
reasons unique to each language, I could not continue to work on any one of them long
enough to generate a dissertation topic. After repeating the mistake of studying a
language halfway and saying good-bye to its speaker(s) several times, I was at a loss for
what to do for dissertation research. At that time, Dr. Abebayehu rescued me from
abandoning the idea of working on a language other than English and Japanese, by giving
me the chance to study Sidaama.
I am lucky enough to have been able to work closely with a person like Dr.
Abebayehu for a long time. He and I were only two floors away in the same building for
several years. He has always been cooperative, letting me ask him about Sidaama notvonly in my office and in our houses, but anywhere, including for example, at Tops
Supermarket at University Plaza, in my car, at the Buffalo Airport, and in one of the
surgery waiting rooms at Kenmore Mercy Hospital, he is always willing to make time for
my questions. He is very tough, and we have usually had a couple of two-hour sessions a
week, sometimes even a several hours’ session in a day. I don’t know how I can thank
him.
I would also like to express my profound thanks to my advisors for their
mentorship. I am very much honored to have been able to be one of their students. My
primary advisor, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, constantly gave me professional comments
and advice on my dissertation. Without him, I would never have been able to complete
my dissertation so fast. Professor Leonard Talmy gave me much advice and insightful
comments on my work over the long years. His every word has always executed a great
influence on me. I would also like to convey my sincere thanks to Professor Jürgen
Bohnemeyer for his constructively critical, detailed written comments and very
encouraging verbal comments on this study.
My gratitude goes to other professors in the Department of Linguistics at the
University at Buffalo for training me as a linguist, especially, Professor Karin Michelson
(who helped me decide on writing on Sidaama), Professor Jean-Pierre Koenig (who
always gave me encouraging advice), Professor Jeri Jaeger (who taught me basic
linguistic analyses and academic writing), Professor Wolfgang Wölck (who gave me
words of cheer and various delicious drinks), Professor David Zubin, Professor Robert
Van Valin, Professor Mitsuaki Shimojo, Professor Roger Woodard, and Professor
Colleen Fitzgerald. I would also like to mention that I gained tremendous benefit fromvithe Field Methods classes, which I took for three years straight here in Buffalo, and
learned very useful fundamental techniques of the elicitation of linguistic data from
Professor Karin Michelson, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, and Professor Colleen
Fitzgerald.
My special thanks go to Professor Norimitsu Tosu, my former advisor at Keio
University, for his continuous encouragement. If I had not studied linguistics under his
instruction, I would not be pursuing this discipline now. I am also indebted to Mr.
Makoto Ebihara, my ex-teacher at Keio Boys’ Senior High School, for directing my
interest to linguistic investigation in my younger days.
There are also many colleagues of mine who I would like to thank. First, Justin
Boffemmyer has read my entire dissertation and given me numerous helpful comments. I
would also like to express my thanks to my officemates, Valeria Belloro, Christopher
Phipps, and Rodrigo Romero-Mendez, for various discussions, and to my other
colleagues who gave linguistic and/or editorial comments on or who had discussion with
me about portions of my dissertation, especially, Justin Boffemmyer, Jerry Bove, Jennifer
Cornish, Ed Escott, Lilian Guerrero, Paul Heider, Sang-gu Kang, Heike Lehnert
LeHouillier, Atsuko Nishiyama, Luis Paris, Yukiko Sugiyama, Khaled Albahri, Yongeun
Lee (Northwestern), and Ichiro Yuhara (Chicago) (their titles are omitted).
My gratitude also goes to Carole Orsolits (Linguistics Department) and Heike
Jones (Center for Cognitive Science) for providing office space to work out of. I have
been able to collect data very efficiently thanks to this space.viiThanks also go to the Mark Diamond Research Fund, the College of Arts and
Sciences dissertation fellowship, and the Department of Linguistics summer research
grants at the University at Buffalo for partial support of the present study.
Saving the most important for last, I would like to convey many thanks to my
family, especially, my wife, children, and parents, for their support and patience. I
apologize for all the great inconvenience that I have caused (and am still causing) to them
because of the studies that I have been conducting over such a long period of time
without sparing much or any time for them and without earning any income. I will do my
best to compensate for this after I go back home.
Finally, please let me make an excuse. I would like the reader to be generous
enough to take my dissertation as a rough draft of my improved future work. Even
though my consultant is superb, I might have made some errors. Also, even though my
brilliant advisors have given me helpful advice, there are many portions that I have not
been able to revise. I have to submit this as my dissertation to the Graduate School now,
because of the deadline (coming in a few minutes!) set by a newly created rule. I hope
that I will be able to revise it as soon as possible. Maganu oohe! in advance again, Dr.
Abebayehu!viiiTab le of Conten ts

East Cushitic language spoken in the south-central part of Ethiopia. Sidaama is spoken
by over 1,800,000 people, but there has been relatively little research on the language.
Chapter 1 (introduction) gives background information on the Sidaama language
and the Sidaama people, briefly reviews previous studies, and discusses the methodology
used in the present study.
Chapters 2-5 use basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe
the phonology and morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event
integration patterns (Talmy 1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this
language.
Chapter 2 (phonology) lists the phonemes, the consonant clusters, and the
geminates, describes suprasegmentals (syllables and moras, pitch accent, intonation, and
pause), and presents morphophonemic rules.
Chapter 3 (parts of speech) describes characteristics of parts of speech. The
topics discussed in this chapter include types of nouns and verbs, similarities between
adjectives and nouns and between adjectives and verbs, various pronominal forms, and
clitics.
Chapter 4 (morphology) discusses reduplication of verb roots, suprafixes on
nouns and adjectives, and suffixes on nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It also examines the
ordering relationship of the suffixes.xviiChapter 5 (syntax) discusses four topics on the syntax of Sidaama. The first
section looks into grammatical relations in terms of how they are coded and in what
constructions they occur. The second topic of Chapter 5 is word order. The third section
of Chapter 5 discusses two types of external possessor construction, the oblique
possessum external possessor construction and the dative possessor external possessor
construction. The fourth section examines the structures of relative clauses and the types
of elements that can be relativized.
Chapter 6 (semantics) examines the semantic structure of Sidaama, which shows
characteristics of a verb-framed language, in terms of how it expresses different types of
events, using Talmy’s (1985, 1991, 2000b) typological framework of event integration.
It investigates how the schematic and the non-schematic components of the five types of
events (motion, state change, realization, temporal contouring, and action correlating)
appear morphosyntactically in this language.xviiiAbb reviat ions

grammatical structure of Sidaama, a Cushitic language of Ethiopia. Chapters 2-5 use
basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe the phonology and
morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event integration patterns (Talmy
1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this language.
This chapter is organized as follows.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

to mean, ‘He washed the clothes clean.’6.2.6 Temporal Contouring
In expressing the events of temporal contouring (aspect), which has a wide variety
of subtypes, Sidaama shows the V-language pattern to some extent, but often deviates
from the V-language pattern.
According to Talmy (2000b), the framing event of temporal contouring has one of
the following two types of structures. First, in aspectual types such as “starting”,
- 780 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 781“stopping”, “continuing”, “remaining manifested”, “iterating”, “intensifying”, and
“tapering off”, the figure is the degree of manifestation of an event, namely whether or
not an event is manifested, and if manifested, how it is manifested, and the ground is a
particular point in time or a period of time. For example, in the English example (6.17)
They talked on, the figure is the full manifestation of the event, the ground is an
unspecified period of time, the core schema is continuation, and the co-event is their
talking.
On the other hand, in the aspectual type of “finishing”, the figure is an affected
object and the ground is temporal contour. The core schema consists of the ground and
the association function, the latter of which is the direction of the relation between the
figure and the ground. For example, in the English sentence I wrote the letter to
completion, where the figure, the letter, is affected in a way that it is agentively “moved”
to completion with the co-event of me writing, and the core schema is made up of a
positive direction of association (the Vector TO) and a terminative temporal contour.
Whichever of the structures the framing event may have, the support relation that
the co-event has in relation to the framing event is “a constitutive relation, in effect
“filling in” the conceptual region outlined by the temporal contour” (Talmy 2000b: 232).
Like other event types, temporal contouring is expressed differently in Vlanguages and S-languages. For the framing event of temporal contouring, V-languages
characteristically use the main verb of a construction and S-languages a satellite (or an
adpositional phrase), though S-languages may also have lexical verbs for temporal
contouring (e.g., English: begin, end, continue, repeat, finish) (Talmy 2000b: 232).","[801, 802]"

publications include Tekleselassie (2002, 2005, 2006), Tekleselassie and Johnstone
(2004), and Alemu and Tekleselassie (2006).
I have had consultation sessions with Abebayehu regularly (usually 2-6 hours a
week, sometimes longer or shorter) to collect Sidaama data. The consultations have been
conducted in English. We usually met in my office at the University at Buffalo, but,
since the late summer of 2005, when he left Buffalo, consultations have been done by
phone.
Admittedly, the use of a single consultant for a grammatical description cannot
take into account idiolectal or dialectal differences. Nevertheless, even when multiple
consultants on a language are employed, it would be difficult to ask all of them exactly
the same set of questions to write a grammar of the language; a bias toward the judgment
of even a small number of linguistic forms by a certain speaker or speakers out of a group
of consultants would be inevitable. The consultation with a single speaker makes it easy
to obtain consistent data. In order to benefit from this strength, I checked almost all the
examples in this dissertation with Abebayehu at least twice.","[46, 47]"

Sidaama has two control constructions where the subject of a non-finite VP
complement is the subject of the matrix clause. In one of the constructions, the infinitive
form of a verb is the direct object of the matrix clause and its subject is also the subject of

can optionally be omitted entirely with the result that only the infintive form of the verb

"In the first pattern exemplified by (6.136b), the realization of the framing event (the
hubcap’s state-change of becoming flat) is beyond the scope of the intention of the agent
expressed by the verb kicked, as in (6.136a). This is a type of state-change event where
the co-event is in a support relation of Cause to the framing event. In the second type
illustrated in (6.137), the agent’s goal of realizing the event in (6.137b) (capturing the
fugitive) is included in the event expressed only by the verb, as in (6.137a), but the use of
the verb hunted alone in (6.137a) is neutral as to whether the goal has been attained. In
the third pattern, which is shown in (6.138), the verb washed implies the fulfillment of
the agent’s goal of cleansing the shirt, as in (6.138a), but the fulfillment can be- 774 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 775confirmed, as in (6.138b). Finally, as in (6.139), the verb drowned asserts that the
agent’s goal of killing him has been attained, and no other element further confirms it.
The question here is how a language expresses the fulfillment of the goal that the
agent intends to attain, or the confirmation of the fulfillment of the agent’s goal that is
only implicated, as in (6.137) and (6.138). In S-languages, it is characteristically done by
the use of a satellite, whereas in V-languages, the main verb of a multi-verb construction
is used. Sidaama basically follows the latter pattern. The ways that Sidaama expresses
this event type are discussed below.
In (6.140), the predicate only implicates the agent’s intention of killing him, but
does not entail its fulfillment.3434The realization of a state-change also follows the same pattern as the fulfillment of the agent’s goal. In
(i), the predicate does not entail the confirmation of the result of his state-change of drowning.

/pp’/, /tt’/, /kk’/, and /cc’/ are the geminates of the ejectives /p’/, /t’/, /k’/, and /c ’/,
respectively.
All the Sidaama consonants can be geminated. Although some previous studies
(e.g., Teferra 2000) claim that /h/ cannot be geminated, there is one example of /hh/
(ahahhe ‘grandparents’). As mentioned earlier, /z/ occurs only in Amharic loan words,
and the geminate /zz/ is also extremely rare (e.g., t’arap’eezza ~ t’arap’eessa ‘table’).
Gemination can occur as grammatical processes (section 2.2 (iv-1), Chapter 4 sections
4.1 and 4.2.2.1.1); according to Ferguson (1976: 67-68), this is a feature found in
Ethiopian languages.
Immediately after the final example listed for each geminate in (2.7), a word
containing the single-consonant counterpart that forms a minimal or near-minimal pair
with the final example is shown in the arrow brackets. The present study lacks minimal
or near-minimal pairs for //-//, /z/-/zz/, /c/-/c c  /, and /n / -/n n / .","[55, 56]"

As has been described so far, Sidaama clearly shows the V-language pattern in the
event categories of motion, state-change, and realization, but not necessarily in the event
categories of temporal contouring and action correlating. Although it is necessary to
examine expression patterns in other languages, one could speculate that unlike motion,
state-change, and realization, where most V-languages exhibit the consistent pattern,
temporal contouring and action correlating may be unstable categories in which subtypes
of V-languages can show different expression patterns. There seems to be a conceivable
factor contributing to the unstableness of these two categories.44
Compared to the framing events of motion, state-change, and realization, those of
temporal contouring and action correlating seem to be very abstract, perhaps to the extent44Temporal contouring has diverse subcategories, and it is likely that its subcategories are expressed
differently from language to language.","[829, 830, 831]"
"3.2.2.2 Noun-Phrase Clitic: =wa
Sidaama has another noun-phrase clitic, =wa, which, like the noun-phrase clitic
=ta/=ha/=re, is bound to a genitive NP or a relative clause. This clitic is used when the
referent of a nominal is treated as an object rather than a location, and a vicinity of it is
the location or the source or goal of a motion; the clitic makes it possible to treat the
object like a location. Because a noun phrase formed with this clitic indicates a location,
the clitic is glossed as ‘place’.
When the clitic =wa occurs immediately after a genitive personal pronoun or
common noun, and is not followed by any suffix, it expresses the location of an entity or
the goal of a motion, specifically ‘at/to the location of the referent of the personal
pronoun or common noun or to an area where it is located’ (The following discussion- 258 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 259only uses ha- ‘to go’ as a verb that takes a goal complement, but applies to other verbs
as well).69
(3.370) and (3.370) are examples where the personal pronoun in the genitive case
isi [3SG.M.GEN] ‘his’ precedes the clitic =wa to express location and goal, respectively.","[279, 280]"

sentence adverbs, directional/locational adverbs, degree adverbs, manner adverbs, and
time adverbs (Schachter 1985: 20, T. Payne 1997: 69-70). However, many Sidaama
lexical adverbs are time adverbs, and there are only a small number of lexical adverbs
that express directions/locations, degrees, and manners.39The remainder of thissubsection looks at non-lexical adverbials in Sidaama to investigate how such adverbial
meanings are expressed.
There are mainly four methods to which Sidaama can resort to express adverbial
meanings without using lexical adverbs: (i) the use of a suffixed noun or a bare-NP
adverbial, (ii) the use of the noun-phrase clitic for location =wa, (iii) the use of a phrase
or clause ending in a suffix, and (iv) the use of adjectives in noun-verb cognate idioms.",[187]

by gapping (section 5.4.2) or pronoun retention (section 5.4.3) (or more broadly,27If the head of the RC in the predicate position of the MC is a CMNP, it is followed by the predicating
form of the NPC =ti (which is not the head of the RC and is not listed in Table 5.6). See (5.279a),
(5.284a), (5.289a), (5.297a), and (5.299a) for examples.
The plural form of the NPC cannot occur in the predicate as its head. When the subject is plural,
the plural NPC is followed by =ti, as in (ib).

possessive pronominal suffix and that of the pronominal object suffix as well as that of
the personal pronoun). In (5.269) (repeated below as (5.272)), which uses the gapping
strategy (the gap is indicated with Ø), the relativized NP is the direct object of the verb in
the RC, and is not expressed in the RC; it would occur immediately before the verb of the
RC if it were expressed in a sentence with the least marked word order. In (5.270)
(repeated below as (5.273)), an example of pronominal retention, the possessive
pronominal suffix -si, which refers to the relativized noun manco, is retained in the RC;
the RC in (5.270), bule min-i-si-ra mar-t-ino, can stand by itself as a complete sentence,
which means ‘Bule went to his house’. The relativized NP in this example is the
possessor of the goal noun followed by the allative suffix.","[641, 642, 643]"

sibling=NPC.PRED.MODIt should be noted that the use of adjectives like nouns is different from the use of
adjectives as nouns. In Sidaama, the noun modified by an adjective can sometimes be
omitted.33 In this case, the adjective modifying the omitted noun looks as if it were
serving as an argument. This happens when the referent of the omitted noun is
understood by the conversation participants to be a particular entity. It also happens
when the referent is compared to another entity that belongs to the category of the
omitted noun that has a property different from the one expressed by the adjective. For33Dryer (2004) points out that there are two types of cases where noun phrases without nouns (or
pronouns) (i.e., those consisting of elements that would otherwise be optional modifiers of “head” nouns)
are likely to be used: (i) “when the speaker does not know what kind of thing the thing that they are
referring to is” and (ii) “when the kind will be so obvious to the hearer that it can be left out” (p.70). Dryer
argues that in the case of (i), nouns do not have a privileged status in noun phrases, and proposes that all
noun phrases are headless; he questions the ‘head’ of an NP as a universal notion. On the other hand,
according to him, in the case of (ii), ellipsis of the noun is likely to be involved.
The use of noun phrases in Sidaama that do not contain nouns, as in (3.145) and (3.146), is an
example of the latter case. Such noun phrases in Sidaama can occur only when the hearer knows what the
ellipsed noun is.","[175, 176]"
