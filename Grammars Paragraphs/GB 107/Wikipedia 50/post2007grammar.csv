"Negation -máa
Final predicates in negative polarity are obligatorily suffixed in -máa (< PTs *maŋ‘not (have)’). Negator -máa is obviously relatable to Copula negator máa (§9.3.3) as well
3697Has to Negative interjection máa (§13.7.3) and Disjunctive coordinator máa (§6.2.5.2).
3698H369HNegator -máa is treated as a distinct form inasmuch as it may license a final predicate by
570suffixing to a bound verb root, whereas the identified cognate forms are grammatical
words.
Semantically, a predicate in -máa is inherently unspecified for any
temporal/aspectual value, unless it is further marked by an aspectual suffix of some kind
(cf. (606)-(607) above). In a discourse context, the aspectual value of a clause marked
370H3701Honly in -máa is inherited from a previous aspectually-specified clause, or else is inferred
based on temporal expressions or other contextual factors. In (614), the inferred
3702Hperfective value of the negated predicate in káa- ‘have/exist’ is derived from the
preceding, thematically-related clause which is marked in Perfective -tó.

‘One or two Kacharis were here. There wasn’t anyone else.’ (NyR, MDS 009-010)
Although unspecified for an aspectual value, clauses in -máa tend to have adefault realis interpretation. In a clause describing some hypothetical or potential future
negative state of affairs, an irrealis marker is most often present, as in (615).

In the Existential possession construction, the notional possessor and the notionalpossessed may take a variety of pragmatic and relational markers, according to their
construed referential values and the polarity of the clause. In positive polarity clauses,
notionally possessed noun phrases tend to take either topic marking, as in (897), or, more
4312Hoften, individuation in go (if indefinite/new information). In negative polarity clauses,
possessed NPs may be marked for individuation (898), but are far more often zero-marked

‘Despite (the rest) having leapt up, one of them was still lying there asleep.’ (IR,

the basic sense ‘in this case or not (which ever it may be)’. In this construction, the first
concessive clause is in -dakkòm ‘CONC’, representing the positive polarity alternative,
while in the second clause the Change of state suffix -dàk ‘COS’ is replaced with Negative

Clause-coordinations in okkə́ə may also occur in Additive constructions (schematically,

4657H16.3.1.2. Disjunctive/alternative coordination
Closed disjunctive coordination among Galo interrogative clauses (‘x or y?’) may
be obtained through apposition of structurally parallel clauses with contrasting semantic
values (§16.2.1). This construction may be additionally supported through marking in
4658Hmáa. In the main a Negative polarity particle, and basically homophonous with the
Negative polarity predicate suffix -máa (§12.2) and the Negative interjection máa ~ máʔ
4659H‘no’ (§13.7.3), in disjunctive function máa marks a polar (closed) alternation between
460Htwo coordinated interrogative clauses. The marked clauses may themselves contrast in
polarity, or they may not. When two clauses are coordinated as in (1060), disjunctive máa
461Htends to pattern prosodically with the supporting clause, although it is important to note789that this is not a synchronically available position for a negator morpheme; in absence of
the focal clause of (1060), the utterance would be ungrammatical. 301

‘Will (life in the future) be better or (…) will it be worse?’ (MN, FYG 010)A prosodic alternative to the construction in (1060) locates the Disjunction
463Hparticle closer to the focal clause, typically after a pause. The function in this case is to
indicate a speaker’s acknowledgement that his addressee might be finding his earlier
utterance somewhat dubious, and is thus offering an alternative that might be more
acceptable to his addressee (1061).

Disjunctive coordination of declarative clauses is not well-coded by Galo
grammar, and generally requires a paraphrastic construction involving a linking clause
with a sense like ‘if that is not the case, then’ (not shown).
16.3.1.3. Concessive coordination
Concessive coordination (‘although/despite (that) x, (still/nonetheless) y’) between
two final clauses is marked in daram, a particle for which no plausible complete
etymology currently exists. 302 daram occurs as a supporting clause particle/enclitic.
301F301Although ungrammatical in a stand-alone sense, such an utterance would be possible if it were
understood that an unspecified alternative were implied, but omitted for some reason (perhaps with an
appropriately lilting intonation); it would not be possible to interpret rəkên jaarə̀ dɨɨmá in (1060) as a final
clause in negative polarity.

257H7.3. Interrogative and indefinite pronouns
The forms discussed in this section are all available for use as interrogative
pronouns, standing for the questioned constituent of a content interrogative clause.
Content interrogative clause formation is discussed from a general perspective in §9.5.1.2.
2573HMany of the forms discussed below are also available for use as indefinite pronouns in
positive and negative polarities, with senses like ‘something’ and ‘nothing’. The
interrogative or indefinite sense of a pronoun is in most cases determined by the syntax of
the clause in which it appears, together with marking by various clausal particles and,
sometimes, intonation. Very broadly speaking, interrogative force is most often obtained
through interrogative pronominal use in a cleft/focus construction (§9.4), while indefinite
2574Hsense is obtained through in-situ use of a pronoun in construction with an appropriate
particle. However, there is much less regularity to the interrogative/indefinite alternation
found in Galo than exists in many other Asian languages; in what follows, we will to
some extent be required to take a case-by-case approach.
7.3.1. Pronoun of person jə̀(ə) ‘who’7.3.1.1. Structure
Interrogative pronouns of person are based on the form jə̀(ə) ‘who’. Unlike other
interrogative pronoun types, jə̀(ə) shares the basic distribution of personal pronouns in
taking pronominal case suffixes such as Pronominal Genitive -kə̀ (Table 7.7).

personal pronouns, when standing unsuffixed in the strong/stressed (initial) position of a

257Hmedial gemination under copula enclisis, which is the regular outcome of Triggered footstrengthening (§4.1.4.6; also compare Table 7.3).

2580Hexist), most speakers accept either long or short forms of jə̀(ə) (179).

‘For whom?’ (IlR, EM 26/02/2008)335If one were to speculate, it would seem that jə̀(ə) derives historically from an
underlyingly monomoraic form jə̀, but that regular lengthening exhibited in stressed
contexts such as in (177), and/or irregular lengthening due to emphasis, has become at
258Hleast partially lexicalized. Although most of my consultants are unwilling to make a
straightforward declaration as to the “correctness” of one or the other variant displayed in
(179), it is possible that more detailed study of the use of jə̀(ə) in discourse will be able to
2583Hdiscover a more patterned variation than I or my consultants have found to date.
7.3.1.2. Functionsjə̀(ə) occurs as noun phrase or genitive phrase head only (it has no capacity to
modify another nominal). In-situ use in interrogative clauses is rare but attested, as in the
rhetorical question in (180). More commonly, content questions in jə̀(ə) are expressed as
2584Han interrogative cleft/focus construction (181).

2586Hclauses is very rare, seemingly due to the existence of the competing, dedicated indefinite
pronoun of person ɲíi (§7.3.2). Limited use of jə̀(ə) in an indefinite positive sense is found
2587Hin construction with a Suppositional particle báa, as in (182); the sense of the overall
258Hconstruction is, roughly, that the identity of the mentioned referent is possible for the
speaker to know, but that the speaker either does not know it because he is not interested
in knowing it, or perhaps does know it but is not interested in disclosing it (see also

In the second type of context, the mentioned referent is construed (roughlyspeaking) as “any given person”. In (184), the identity of the individual whose stick was
2591Hin fact broken is well-known to both speaker and addressee. However, the speaker is
uttering the statement as a general law, in the sense that any time that any person’s stick
is purposefully broken, an infraction will be determined to have been committed.

“You have to go (with him, as a punishment)...because you broke somebody’s

Indefinite pronoun of person ɲíi quite obviously derives – probably quite recently
– from the lexical noun ɲíi ‘person; human’, and in some uses it can remain perfectly
ambiguous with its erstwhile nominal form (for example, ɲíi=go áa-dùu
‘someone/person=IND come-IPFV’ ‘someone/a person is coming’). However, that ɲíi in
337fact functions as a pronoun in sentences like (183)-(184) is quite certain due to its taking
259H2593Hpronominal suffixal case-marking (§6.1.3) – an impossibility for any lexical noun. In an
2594Hexample such as (184), if ɲíi were to take a phrasal genitive enclitic gə, the sense would
259Hbe of a lexical noun: ɲíi=gə hɨɨdàa ‘person=GEN stick’ ‘(that) person’s stick; the stick of
human(kind)’.
7.3.3. Pronoun of quantity jadɨ ̀ ~ jadə̀ ‘how much/many’
7.3.3.1. Structure
The interrogative/indefinite pronoun of quantity in Galo is jadɨ ̀ ~ jadə̀ ‘how
much/many’. Unlike interrogative/indefinite pronouns of person, jadɨ ̀ ~ jadә̀ takes phrasal
(clitic) rather than pronominal (suffixal) relational markers, suggesting that it has the
syntactic staus of a noun rather than a pronoun per se (Table 7.8).

Note in (356) that go undergoes Initial gemination (§4.1.5.1) – normally not a
3015H3016Hproperty of go – and also that it appears to merge to the following copula in most
conditions. It may be that this sequence is in the process of grammaticalizing as a distinct
counterfactual copula gee, although a number of further tests must be conducted before
this can be declared with any certainty.
9.3.3. Appositive clauses and negation
Appositive clauses make use of two negators máa and móo. The first and most
general negator máa is homophonous with the Negative predicate inflection -máa ‘NEG’
(§12.2) as well as negative interjection máa ‘no’ (§13.7.3); móo is only very rarely
3017H3018Hrepresented outside copula clauses, and may represent an irregular retention or semi-427assimilated loan. 197 máa is used with the Imperfective copula əə, and like other copula
196Foperators (§13.3.2.3), follows the copula. móo is generally used with the Perfective
3019Hcopula, preceding it.

I have few if any examples of negated verbless clauses in my data in which both
VCS and VCC arguments are present, although several attested examples of negated nounphrases could in principle be analysed as negated Verbless clause complements, with the
VCS argument ellipsed. It is generally possible to assume in such cases that VCS is“underlyingly” represented as a pronoun such as əgə̀ ‘ANAP.IND’, with the basic sense
‘that one; it’. Whether such utterances are considered to be true verbless clauses or simply
negated noun phrases, the negator in either case would appear to be máa (360).

(198). Note that this is a different function from that of Partitive ‘which (member of a

to its basic function as an interrogative/indefinite pronoun, are not easily describable in
terms of the same set of syntactic features or constructions.
In a use which may derive originally from an emphatic use of its indefinite sense
in a negative polarity clause such as in (202), jòo is also now available as an interjection2639Hlike expression of emphasized impossibility (203). Possibly, the evolution of this function
2640Hwas assisted both by the ability of jòo to occur as a pre-head modifier, as in (202) (cf.
2641H(198)), as well as by its (prosodically regular, but often emphasized for increased salience)
264Hfrequent occurrence with a rising-pitch tone contour – which lends itself naturally to
emphatic extensions.

A second functional extension of jòo, quite different from the preceding, is that ofa universal pro-form with the basic semantic value ‘etcetera; and all that sort of thing; and
so forth and so on’. This sense seems to emerge out of the potential indefinite value of jòo
in a positive polarity clause, but also seems to depend on being able to occur as the
second member of an appositive construction as in (204).

Use of jòo in appositive constructions such as (204) with unmarked/nonreferential

namely, to the qualifying noun jòo ‘and/or suchlike’, also discussed in §8.3. Although

‘what (is the problem here)’, ‘what (are you prevaricating over)’ or ‘what (ill do you think

"Aspect12.3.1. Tense or aspect?
Nearly all published descriptions of Tani grammar, whether early or modern and
whether produced by local or international scholars, refer to markers of “present tense”,
“past tense”, “future” and so on (Das Gupta 1963; Simon 1972, and many others).
However, use of the term “tense” in the description of Tani grammar has been criticized
571by Sun (2003), who claimed on the basis of data from Mising and Na (Bangni) –
representing the Eastern and Western branches of Tani respectively – that what is
referenced by Tani verbal inflections are not tense values at all, but rather aspectual
values. My own Mising and Galo data are fully consistent with Sun’s (2003) analysis.
With reliable supporting data from each major branch of Tani languages, it would seem
that an aspectual system of some kind should be reconstructible to Proto-Tani.
Furthermore, it would seem that the existence of a true tense system in a modern Tani
language is of extremely low probability. I briefly substantiate these arguments here with
respect to the system found in Galo.
Tense and aspect are both generally understood as systems for referencing or
encoding the temporal structure of a clause, usually by way of some sort of clause-level
inflectional operator, or else by direct marking on the predicate head (Bybee and Dahl
1989). By tense is generally meant a system organized around a given temporal reference
point (usually, the “present”), and in which any reported event or state is obligatorily
marked as temporally prior to or at the reference point (or some similar configuration)
(Comrie 1985). By aspect (in the narrowest and most precise sense) is meant a system for
referencing the internal temporal structure of an event or state from an often large
number of possible viewpoints, but almost always including whether it is construed as
finished or not finished. Often, aspectual systems make use of a temporal reference point
of some kind (such as the time of speaking) but do not obligatorily do so and/or may
freely set temporal reference points which are distant from the present (Comrie 1976).
Very frequently – perhaps over 90% of the time, although I have not actually
counted – imperfective marking in Galo occurs on the predicate head of a clause with
present time reference, and perfect or perfective marking occurs on the predicate of a
clause with past time reference (with perfective clauses sometimes felt by consultants to
be “further in the past” than perfect clauses). However, it is neither necessary that a clause
with present or past time reference has its predicate marked imperfective or perfective,
nor that a predicate marked imperfective or perfective has present or past time reference,
respectively. For example, compare the Galo sentences in (616) with their English
3705Htranslations. In these sentences, the speaker unmistakably sets his temporal reference
point in the past, precisely at the time when he and his group migrated from the highland
village of daarɨ ̀ɨ down to their present location at hilɨ ̀ɨ village – exactly forty-two years
prior to the time of speaking. However, the speaker’s construal of most of the events he
reports lacks a specific point of termination (because he still lives in hilɨ ̀ɨ at the time of
speaking); the corresponding clauses are accordingly marked in the imperfective. By
572contrast, it is impossible to represent the same temporal structure in English without using
past-tensed verbs.

Furthermore, as noted in §12.2 (see also (606)), it is common for negative polarity
3706H370Hclauses in Galo to lack temporal-aspectual marking of any kind. The prevailing temporal
structure of the discourse is generally inherited by such clauses, which are not generally
found by Galo speakers to be ambiguous or uninterpretable. 231

Modal predicate derivations express some aspect of the speaker’s attitude toward
the information contained in the predicate or its arguments, including ideas of (relative)
certainty, need, possibility, ability, capacity, obligation, necessity, or desirability/desire.
None have cognate forms elsewhere in the language, so far as I can see. Forms attested to
date are listed in Table 11.9.

-dée ‘PROSPECTIVE’ marks an event or state as having a real possibility of coming
to pass, in the sense of not being subject to any external constraints (579). In negative
360Hpolarity clauses, the sense is opposite, i.e. of restriction, prohibition, or some other
external constraint (580).

‘You’re prohibited from eating chillies; you’re prohibited from eating squirrels

In terms of frequency, -dée most often occurs in nominalizations, where its senseis often closer to future/irrealis; i.e., that the marked event/state will or is expected to
come to pass (581). This may amount to a functional compensation for the relatively
3608Hgreater set of restrictions placed on occurrence of the Irrealis suffix -rә́ in nominalized
clauses (cf. §15.3.2.2.2).

‘Who will be tonight’s cook (i.e., my wife or yours)?’ (MN, OL23:86)-dée is also subject to a very unusual ordering constraint which suggests it may be
in the process of a category shift, either to inflectional suffixal or some sort of modal
auxiliary-like status. When occurring in a quadrisyllabic predicate structure, -dée has
been observed to preferentially follow the negator, a property usually reserved for
predicate inflections; compare (581) with (582).

Ability -là(a) ‘ABIL’ refers to the subject’s ability to bring about the predicated
event/state, in terms of skill, knowledge, technical facility, or some more general means
(584); -là(a) ‘ABIL’ most often cross-translates English ‘can’.

‘Now, we can’t even go up to the Adi place anymore (because we’re old and

3614Hoccurring as the third syllable in a quadrisyllabic (or larger) predicate, its rhyme is
obligatorily truncated, as [la] (585).

361Hpossible rejoinder to questions such as (585).

sentence like (586) can only be contextually derived from a sentence like (585); i.e., -là(a)
3619H3620H‘ABIL’ cannot be straightforwardly used as predicate head in a simple declarative clause.
This topic is discussed in a more general context in §11.1.6.2.
3621H11.2.6.3. Capability -làk
Cabaility -làk ‘CAP’ is indicative of the subject referent’s capacity or capability to
bring about the predicated event/state, in terms of the subject referent’s inherent physical
characteristics, some other natural characteristics, or more generally as a result of some
necessary or unalterable conditions that obtain in a particular situation, as in (587).

‘She couldn’t return to her parents’ house either; the stone had completely
submerged her.’ (LN, TG 072)
Although -là(a) ‘ABIL’ could also occur in the bolded position in (587), the speaker would
362Hthen be heard as implying a relatively greater potential on the part of the subject referent
to control the predicated event. Thus, for example, while ŋó ín-là(a)-máa ‘1.SG walk/goABIL-NEG’ ‘I cannot go’ might be used in a case when a prior social commitment prevents553one from going somewhere, ŋó ín-làk-máa ‘1.SG walk/go-CAP-NEG’ ‘I’m unable to go’
would imply that one’s legs are broken, one’s leg muscles are undeveloped (as a newborn
baby), or that one suffered from some other unalterable incapacitating condition.
11.2.6.4. Desiderative -lɨ ̀ɨ
Desiderative -lɨ ̀ɨ ‘DESD’ most directly translates the desiderative modals found in a
wide range of other languages, such as English want. It generally indicates of the clause
subject referent a desire, wish or choice-based intent to bring about the predicated
event/state (588)-(589).

"Interruption of the predicate complex
As the above subsections have discussed, there is good evidence for the relativephonological independence of sub-predicate “words”, but less evidence for their
grammatical independence. This view of the predicate as a basically irreducible syntactic
constituent is to an extent challenged by the ability of certain “versatile” particles
(discussed in more detail in §13.5) to “interrupt” the predicate complex – usually, with an
3165Hemphatic function, and always at the boundary of a phonological word. In (408),
316HEmphatic particle (ə)i ́ occurs twice, first at the edge of a temporally-subordinated clause
and the second time “interrupting” the predicate rə́-kú-máa ‘live/exist-CMPL-NEG’ ‘not
live/exist anymore’. Note that *rəkú and *maané cannot be analysed as grammatical
words themselves, since the predicate overall is ungrammatical here if unsuffixed by -máa
(-kú ‘CMPL’ is a Secondary predicate inflection which cannot itself license a grammatical
predicate word; see §12.3.3.1). Furthermore, né is a clause-final particle which marks the
3167Hillocutionary force of the entire utterance (§13.3.2.2.2), and stands in no immediate
3168Hdependency relation to Negative suffix -máa. In (409), (ə)i ́ interrupts the predicate
3169Hcomplex at a different point, following the verb stem and preceding all inflections. The
boundary of such grammatical word-internal “interruptions” is conventionally marked
“≡” in this grammar.",[457]

(AO, CC 102)The abovementioned syntactic possibilities notwithstanding, it is certainly the case that
speakers view sentences like (1143) as being “about” the subordinated proposition –
4857Hrather than “about” any particular nominal referent as such. This would seem to make it
clear that, at a minimum, we are dealing in a semantic sense with a complementation
strategy, if not with syntactic complementation per se.
16.5.4.4.1. Quasi-modal of necessity
A seeming semantic extension of the ‘be passable’ sense of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ gives the
closest fully native Galo equivalent to the Assamese loaned/calqued modal of necessity inlagí-/lage (§16.6.2.1). As an “Indic-avoidance strategy”, it has high emblematic value as a
485Hconstruction, but certainly suffers from relatively much lower frequency of usage than the
Assamese loan/calque, particularly in the foothills (1144).

‘I had to push him (to do it).’ (MN, OL23:125)Sentences such as (1144) are understood as having a strong ‘necessity’ overtone, but
4860Hpossibly have, or are at least potentially ambiguous with, a weaker core sense alike to ‘it
did to x/was considered reasonable/passable to x’. Note also that negation of the matrix
predicate does not indicate lack of necessity, but rather indicates that the subordinated
proposition simply ‘won’t do’ (1145); although necessity to not do something can be
4861H832expressed through negation of the subordinated clause predicate (not shown), it is not
possible to directly negate the semantic ‘necessity’ operator in this construction (i.e., to
state that it is not necessary to do something). This fact suggests that while useful as an
alternative in some cases, this construction has not in fact grammaticalized a true modal
usage, and probably does not represent a true (or realistic) native alternative to the
Assamese-derived modal in lagí-/lage.

In a certainly recent and frequently-exploited case of desubordination, a
subjunctive-like construction has developed through deletion of matrix verb rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in the
sense ‘do (British sense); be passable’. Clearly capitalizing on the hypothetical semantics
of other types of clausal subordination, a “stand-alone” clausal subordination in this
condition has the basic sense ‘that [CLAUSE] should be the case’.
In a few cases, the matrix verb can be replaced with little change in meaning, as in
(1146); a sentence originally uttered with no matrix verb. When asked, the speaker
4862Hresponded that he was “saying it short” by leaving the matrix verb off and felt it was
“more correct” to include it; note also the seeming transference of the ‘be necessary’
sense of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ discussed in §16.5.4.4.1.

‘(It would do) for we two to cut it.’ (IR, OL17:55)
In other cases, the “subordinate” clause seems clearly to be exhibiting mainclause-like status. In (1147), note the occurrence of clause-final hortative particle káa
486H‘HORT.ADVS’, which ordinarily occurs as a predicate enclitic. A consultant later informed
me that although it would be possible to include an imperative matrix verb in rɨ ̀- ‘do’
(preceding the hortative particle), the sentence was probably “better” as attested.
833Accordingly, in such cases it would seem preferable to view the “subordinated” clause inbə́ as, in fact, a main clause in subjunctive mood.

When data from more northerly Galo dialects are made available, it may become
possible to shed more light on the origin and functions of this suffix.
12.3.3.4. Achievement -dáa
Achievement -dáa is a seemingly quite old and versatile form which is not wellattested as a final predicate suffix. Depending on its position and the overall construction
in which it appears, it may be analysed as having a basically contrastive, repetitive,
recursive, or achievement-oriented sense, and may in fact be able to be analysed in terms
of more than one distinct form. A seemingly cognate particle or particles with similar
functionality is described in §13.2.2.4-§13.2.2.5.
3805H3806H593As a final predicate inflection, -dáa seems to occur alone only in appositive, semiidiomatic constructions. The overheard utterance in (657) was later judged by my
3807Hconsultants to be “not good grammar”, but possible in a poetic or idiomatic sense.

gemination (§4.1.5.1); the sense and behaviour here closely recall that of the Repetitive

3812Hsense ‘once/as soon as x, y’. It is at present not possible to discern whether the234In the speech of some (mainly younger) Galo, the Achievement suffix may be freely ordered before or
after the Negator, with the same overall sense. However, this mode of speech was repeatedly criticized by
some of my most astute consultants, who viewed this usage as an incorrect reanalysis of the basically
homophonous Manner predicate derivation -dáa ‘SWIFTLY’; i.e., the sense of a differently-ordered (658)
should be ‘he isn’t going/didn’t go swiftly (but he is going/did go)’. I have treated the reanalysed use as
marginal speech in this grammar, however attention should clearly be paid to whether the use continues to
spread, or not.","[592, 593, 594]"
"430notwithstanding, clause-final particles such as Declarative na mark the focus of an
appositive clause more often than they do not, and possibly aid in disambiguating topic
from focus in what is after all a relatively formally symmetrical construction (362).
304HHowever, in an appositive focus construction, the focused constituent is fronted to the left
of the clause; in this case, the focus is obligatorily marked by a focus particle (363).

Although the symmetrical structure of a verbless clause may cause it to appear as though

A predicative cleft/focus construction derives its basic structure from the
appositive focus construction described in §9.4.1, and again consists of two major surface
308Hconstituents, the marked focus and the presupposed topic. However, a predicative
431cleft/focus construction is based underlyingly on a multi-constituent predicative clause;
the surface, two-constituent appositive structure of the cleft/focus construction thus
interacts with the underlyingly multi-constituent predicative clause structure in a number
of ways.
First, the predicate of a predicative cleft/focus construction undergoes obligatory
nominalization by one of the “Primary” nominalizers -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, -nam
‘NZR:RLS/NSUB’, -há ‘NZR:IRR’, or -kò ‘NZR:LOC/OBL’ (§15.2). The nominalized predicate
309Hthen stands as the core constituent of the clause topic; it may be uninflected/stem-based
(366) or inflected (367) (see §15 for definitions of these types).

‘Who might it have been who lit (this fire)?’ (KN, OLxx)
The focus particle describes a clear boundary between the marked focus and thetopic. This is relatively easy to see in examples like (366)-(367), in which both the
304H304Hmarked focus and the topic contain only a single internal constituent. When more than
one constituent of the underlying predicative clause is included in the surface structure,
they may be treated either as marked focus constituents, or as topic constituents. In most
cases, underlying predicative clause constituents will retain whatever marking they would
have taken in the underlying predicative clause – for example, O arguments will (when
definitely referential) be marked in the Accusative, and Adverbials will (when derived) be
marked by an adverbializing enclitic, etc. However, underlying predicative clause
subjects are zero-marked if and only if they occur inside the marked focus (368).
3045HUnderlying predicative clause subjects which are treated as topic constituents are
obligatorily in the Genitive (369).

It is not entirely clear why a non-focused constituent of an underlying predicativeclause can occur within either the marked focus or the topic of a predicative cleft/focus
construction, or whether there is a significant pragmatic difference between one or the
other grouping strategy (there is certainly no semantic difference). Although one might
speculate that the First person plural referent constitutes a secondary focus in a sentence
such as (368), while not at all under focus in (369), this cannot at present be demonstrated
3047H3048Hwith any certainty.
Choice of predicate nominalizer in a predicative cleft/focus construction is
generally determined by the underlying grammatical relation of the marked focus to the
nominalized predicate; that is, a focused underlying subject will tend to select for a
subject nominalizer -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, while a focused underlying O argument will tend to
select for a non-subject nominalizer -nam ‘NZR:NSUB’ (cf. §15.3.2). However, variation of
3049Hthe nominalizer is also possible, and may yield subtle and intriguing differences of
interpretation – particularly in interrogative cleft/focus constructions. For example, (370)305H(371) are a minimal interrogative clause pair in which the predicate is nominalized in -nà
3051H‘NZR:SUB’ in the first example and in -kò ‘NZR:LOC/OBL’ in the second. The denotation of
the two sentences is basically identical; however, note that in (370), the locative/oblique
3052Hnominalizer references the location of jùp- ‘sleep’, as might be expected given the
locative marking on the focus-marked interrogative pronoun. By contrast, in (371), the
305Hsubject nominalizer references the actor of jùp- ‘sleep’, despite that this is now not
coreferential with the focused interrogative pronoun. Almost impossible to translate
effectively into a corresponding English sentence pair, the effect of this alternation
appears to be to highlight the relative thematic importance of one or another clause
constituent – quite independently of the effect of focus marking and/or interrogative
433pronoun choice. For example, while (370) might be uttered in the context of a
3054Hconversation about sleeping-places, (371) would be (and in fact was) uttered in in the
305Hcontext of a conversation about a person.

Focused constituents sometimes exhibit non-canonical marking with respect totheir function in the underlying predicative clause, which may at least in part relate to
their basic surface status as appositive clause constituents. For instance, in (372) the
3057Hfocused noun phrase is unmarked for case, despite that it underlyingly refers to a nonsubject argument of nɨ ́k- ‘punch’. This seems to reflect the surface syntactic status of the
focused noun phrase as an appositive clause subject. In absence of case-marking, both
goal and locative construals (associated with locative/oblique nominalizer -kò) are
possible. In (373) however, the focused noun phrase is marked in the accusative, and now,
3058Honly the goal reading is possible. This seems to relate to the usual status of semantic goals
as E (extension to core) arguments in Galo, and the association of accusative case
marking with E argument status (§14.1.3.8).

306Hconstructions are relatively rare, being generally used in cases when a speaker wishes to
draw unusually high attention to a contrastive referent, especially one whose identity was
explicitly in question. Accordingly, a declarative focus construction is the normal
rejoinder to an interrogative focus construction (374).

exemplified in §4.2.3. For present purposes, it will suffice to show that in a qualifying
3064Hphonological context, the underlying presence of əə in these constructions can be
adequately demonstrated; in (375), note that underlying əə triggers gemination in the

In this section, types of non-declarative predicative and appositive clauses are
discussed. We first review interrogative clause types (§9.5.1), followed by imperatives,
3067Hhortatives and suggestives (§9.5.2).
3068H9.5.1. Interrogative clauses
Galo interrogatives are divided into polar (a.k.a. “yes/no”) and content (a.k.a.
“WH-”) subtypes.
9.5.1.1. Polar interrogative clauses
The function of a polar interrogative clause is to ask an addressee whether he or
she believes a particular assertion made by the speaker to be in fact the case (‘yes’) or not
(‘no’).
In Galo, polar interrogatives are formed according to one of three basic patterns,
all of which are based closely on (i.e., do not involve significant reorganization of) main
declarative clause syntax.
1) tag particles
2) interrogative particles
3) preferred inflections
9.5.1.1.1. Tag particles
The simplest and most frequent means of forming a polar question is via one of a
variety of tag particles, all of which occur as enclitics to a main declarative clause (in any
person). Most tag particles represent intonational and/or segmental variants of a
“versatile” particle with the core segmental form (ʔə)i, with correspondingly different
pragmatic implications (described in §13.5.1), and may in turn be supplemented in their
3069Huse by phrasal intonation. The tag particle may directly follow the copula/predicate, or it
may follow any other occurring particles, including interrogative particles (§9.5.1.1.2).
307HThe resulting construction has the overall sense of an assertion whose validity the speaker
wishes to check with the addressee. It and all other polar questions may be answered inmm ‘yes’ or máa ‘no’, and/or in a repetition of the questioned clause (or some portion
436thereof, but always including the predicate) in positive or negative polarities. (376)
3071Hillustrates a question-response pair in a predicative clause structure; (377) illustrates use
3072Hof a tag particle in an appositive clause.

‘(He’s) a father, isn’t he.’ (MK, TT 143)9.5.1.1.2. Interrogative particles
The most explicit means of forming polar questions is via one of several available
illocutionary force particles, all of which occur in the same (predicative or appositive)
clause-final syntactic position, but which vary in terms of semantic value and pragmatic
implications. Among them, ree ‘PQ’ is the functionally “unmarked” polar question marker
(378)-(379). A table of all currently-attested interrogative particles together with further
307H3074Hdiscussion and examples may be found in §13.3.3.

‘Are you (a) Galo?’ (TN, OL6:29)9.5.1.1.3. Preferred inflections
An inflected predicative clause with a second person subject may take on polar
interrogative illocutionary force in certain aspects, usually with a marked falling
intonation. The preferred form for polar questions in a perfect(ive) aspect is Experiential437perfect -bée (§12.3.2.7); the preferred form for polar questions in an imperfect(ive) aspect
3076His Stative -dó(o) (§12.3.2.2).

ín-lɨ ̀ɨ-dó(o)=_̀
2.SG go-DESD-STAT/PQ=FI
‘Do you want to go?’ (*/?’You generally want to go’)
I have the impression that these conventions may be further grammaticalizing,especially in the speech of younger Galo and/or residents of Assamese contact areas. For
many of them, a main declarative clause in Stative -dó(o) is almost always viewed as
having interrogative force, even in first or third person subjects. At the same time, several
of my older consultants and those residing away from Assamese contact areas have
criticized overuse of preferred inflections among some “foothills” Galo, and have
indicated to me that they in turn sometimes find it difficult to determine whether the
speaker intends to form a question or a statement. It remains to be seen exactly how this
development will play out in the speech of future generations.
9.5.1.2. Content interrogative clauses
The function of a content interrogative clause is to question some aspect of a state
of affairs about which some amount of detail is known, usually by replacing the
constituent of a phrase or clause which is under question with an interrogative pronoun.
Galo content interrogatives are formed according to one of three structural patterns:
1) in-situ
2) constituent-internal
3) cleft/focus
Use of one or another pattern is dependent on a variety of factors, including the
type of interrogative pronoun used, the constituent being questioned, the nature of the
predicate/clause type being used to form the question (appositive, predicative and/or
438subtype thereof) and the precise nature of the illocutionary force the speaker hopes to
achieve. The resulting picture is complex, and has not yet been comprehensively
investigated. The following subsections will present the basic patterns involved; a number
of the individual distributional characteristics of interrogative pronouns are also discussed
in §7.3, where their indefinite uses are also reviewed. Some additional remarks on content
3078Hquestion-marking particles are also found in §13.3.3. Ultimately, however, a good deal
3079Hmore research must be conducted before an exhaustive description of Galo content
interrogatives can take shape.
9.5.1.2.1. In-situ
In-situ content interrogatives are formed via replacement of a questioned phrase or
clause constituent with an appropriate interrogative pronoun. In-situ questioning of clause
constituents in Galo predicative clauses is not always possible, since the sense of many
such constructions is indefinite rather than interrogative (cf. §7.3). Where they do occur,
308Hsuch questions often have an informal feel (382)-(384).

In-situ use of interrogative pronouns in appositive clauses is common, and may beunsupported or supported by an appropriate clause-final interrogative particle;
unsupported interrogative clauses again tend to have a less formal feel. Although it cannot
yet confidently be stated as a categorical requirement, the questioned constituent occurs in

‘But anyhow, certainly there’d have been no way (for them) to cut down the

Despite the relatively nominalization-like structure and behaviour of verbal
subordinations – such as occurrence with an obligatorily genitive subject and the ability to
occur as CC of a negative copula – it is important to underline the fact that verbal
825subordinations are not, strictly speaking, syntactic nominals. Although certain
“subordinable” verb stems such as dó-mèn ‘eat-AS.PLAY’ in (1127) are in fact capable of
482Hstanding as a possessed nominal, as ŋó-kә̀ dó-mèn=әә dó-kèn-dùu ‘1.SG-GEN eatAS.PLAY=TOP eat-GOOD/EASY-IPFV’ ‘my snack is delicious’, they then have a differentsense (namely, ‘snack (as a foodstuff)’ rather than ‘(activity of) play-eating’). On the
other hand, other subordinable stems such as dó-hí ‘eat-REFL’ in (1126) or dó-tà ‘eat-INCP’
4829Hin (1129) cannot be used as a nominal at all. Therefore, it is not possible to analyse a
4830Hverbal subordination as, for example, Dative marking of a zero-nominalized verb stem in
any synchronic sense. Nor does it seem possible to treat the enclitic bə́ ‘SBRD’ as itself a
nominalizer in the sense established in this grammar, since subordinations in bə́ are in
most cases unable to stand as head of an argument noun phrase (whereas all
nominalizations discussed in §15 are, at least in their basic uses). Thus, while verbal
4831Hsubordinations certainly have a relatively less finite clause structure, and could certainly
be historically derived from a type of nominalization, their synchronic status would not
appear to be that of a nominal in the stricter sense employed in §15.
4832HFigure 16.9 schematizes the structure of a verbal subordination. Note that the
483Hrelative linear position of constituents here is insignificant; although morphosyntactically
“lighter” verbal subordinations tend to be predicate-adjacent and/or to follow the higher
clause subject, and relatively “heavier” phrases tend to be set syntactically apart from the
main clause, this seems to be a purely processing-oriented condition which does not
reflect any underlying structural ordering constraints.

‘very real/true’ (note here that the relative orders of the ‘Negative’ and ‘Intensifier’
morphemes are opposite). Although the correspondence is not certain, there are other
examples in Galo of forms with basically intensive or emphatic values apparently
deriving from negative forms; for example, see the set of ‘tag rejoinder’ particles
illustrated in §13.3.2.3.4.
280H5.3.1.4. Two-term compounds
Two-term compounds are usually quadrisyllabic constructions composed of two
disyllabic nouns or adjectives, with the overall prosodic status of a phonological phrase
(§4.1.4), and with the grammatical status of a single grammatical word (usually a noun).
281HAlthough many two-term compounds are not synchronically analyzable to speakers, the
patterns on which they are formed are in general productive in modern Galo.
Two-term compounds may be symmetrical (§5.3.1.4.1) or asymmetrical
28H(§5.3.1.4.2). Asymmetrical two-term compounds are further subdivided into common
283H(§5.3.1.4.2.1), root-pivotal (§5.3.1.4.2.2) and expressive (§5.3.1.4.2.3) subtypes.
284H285H286H2745.3.1.4.1. Symmetrical two-term compounds
Symmetrical two-term compounds (a.k.a. “coordinative compounds”) are
composed of two structurally and semantically parallel terms (usually nouns and
deverbal nominalizations, but sometimes also adjectives). In a symmetrical two-term
compound, each term denotes a prototypical exemplar, or a particularly salient or
inalienable feature of a natural class or type denoted by the whole. For example, inhodúm-horə́ ‘big game’, hodúm ‘barking deer’ and horə́ ‘boar’ are each among the most
commonly hunted ‘big game’ animals, and donám ‘eating’ and tɨɨnám ‘imbibing’ are the
most important aspects of a person’s donám-tɨɨnám ‘upkeep; sustenance’. Ordering
appears largely conventional, as opposed to semantically hierarchical; for example,

‘Is it not the case that Tani’s mother...was still alive.’ (MK, TT 056)Uninflected Final clausal nominalizations based on event nominalizations are even
more common. In this case, although the clause as a whole still has the overall syntactic
form of a copula clause, there is no hint of an equative or attributive sense (unlike most
copula clause types in Galo); rather, the sense is of information being presented as an
established, backgrounded and unquestionable fact. In (1037), the speaker is stating as a
4603Hconclusion what is known to be a fact – that the plains peoples managed to retain written
language (while the hill peoples are believed to have lost it). In (1038), the speaker reacts
460Hto an addressee’s (seemingly naïve) uncertainty underlying a previous question ‘do you
have to go today’ both by admonishing the addressee (via clause-final particle né
‘DECL.ADM’) and presenting the information as a fact.

Inflected Final clausal nominalizations exhibit a complex set of patterns, some of
which have yet to be fully worked-out. All forms currently attested seem to exhibit
person-based restrictions which may be related to attribution of knowledge. The most
common by far involves predicate nominalization in -nà ‘NZR:SUB’, followed by an
Imperfective copula əə. The sense is of a strong assertion, as ‘I’m telling you that I know
this to be the case’. In (1039), the speaker is predicting that he will sacrifice ten mithuns,
4605Han event over which he has direct control; a parallel clause with a third person subject is
not accepted by my consultants (1040).

Although an inflected Final clausal nominalization resembles an uninflected Finalclausal nominalization in terms of surface syntax, it is not identical. In particular,
although the nominalized predicate in a participant clausal nominalization has
nominalized clause status – and can therefore act as a relative clause modifier of an
external head noun (cf. §15.3.2.2.1) – this is not possible in an inflected clausal
4608Hnominalization; compare (1042) with (1039) and also (1034)-(1035).

Inflected Final clausal nominalizations in event nominalizer -nam ‘NZR:RLS’ arerare in imperfective aspects, but can seemingly occur in either first or second/third person
subjects. However, perfective Final clausal nominalizations in -nam ‘NZR:RLS’ exhibit a
conjunct/disjunct marking pattern – again, this may relate to a concept of direct or indirect

Irrealis/Obligative Final clausal nominalization is the Perfective copula ee ‘COP.PFV’. The
overall sense of the expression is future speculative; it occurs commonly in conditional
coordinations (1043).

‘Why do you want it?’ (MN, OLB5:84)15.3.2.3. Backgrounding clausal nominalizations
Backgrounding clausal nominalizations, like Final clausal nominalizations, occur
in both uninflected and inflected forms. Backgrounding clausal nominalizations occur
clause-internally – not as a structural clause constituent – but rather as an aside, generally
providing some background information which the speaker believes will enhance the
main information presented in the clause. However, while Final clausal nominalizations
are structurally copula clauses, and can take either of the Imperfective or Perfective
copulas (§15.3.2.2), Backgrounding clausal nominalizations are instead marked as topics.
4617H777Although the Topic marker and Imperfective copula are homophonous, and probably
share a common etymology (§9.3.4), note that in a Backgrounding clausal nominalization
4618Hthe Perfective copula can not occur (suggesting that this may not, in fact, be a copulaheaded construction).
Backgrounding clausal nominalizations make use of both participant and event
nominalizations. Participant nominalizations generally give supplementary information
concerning a particular argument, and occur adjacent to that argument in the syntax. In
(1045), note that despite the relative clause-like structure, and the translation as a relative
4619Hclause in English, it is not possible to add an external head noun in the Galo construction.

“Framing” clausal nominalizations are statistically the most frequent use of any
nominalization-based construction in my corpus by far; 298 they are generally (possibly
297Fonly) built on event nominalizations in -nam ‘NZR:RLS’. Functionally related to the socalled “tail-head linkage” (de Vries 2005) or “recapitulative” constructions (de Vries
298This is certainly due in part to the relatively high concentration of narrative texts in my corpus. Framing
clausal nominalizations are considerably less frequent in face-to-face conversation, although they do
occasionally occur.","[774, 775, 776, 777, 778]"
"585Semantically, -kú ‘CMPL’ marks an event or state as a point of completion, as the
final stage of an episode or state of affairs, as a transition point between two contrasting
states of affairs, or as the onset of a state which contrasts explicitly with some prior state
of affairs (which is thereby viewed as complete). Often, it entails a telic sense that an
anticipated point of state-onset or event-termination has been reached. Typical English
translations for the sense of -kú ‘CMPL’ in different contexts include ‘yet’ (in the negative,
as in not yet arrived), ‘now’, ‘have become’, ‘finally’, ‘after all’, ‘in the end’, ‘at last’,
‘anymore’ (in the negative) or ‘already’. Interestingly, -kú ‘CMPL’ also has a related sense
‘back’ in the sense of ‘return to original position’, as when a predicate refers to a state of
affairs that is ordinarily true of the subject referent, but from which it had departed for
some duration; examples of this sense would include ‘went (back) home’ or ‘opened his
eyes (which were temporarily closed)’. Again, this usage refers to the completion of an
episode, in this case one entailing an excursion from normality.
The following examples illustrate various uses of Completive -kú. In (642), which
3768His repeated from (636) above, Completive -kú marks a new state as contrasting with a
3769Hprevious state, to which it is also thematically related. Failure to mark the Imperfective
predicate in -kú would give the clause the feel of happenstance, as though the speaker
were simply making a general observation which had no explicit relevance to the
preceding context.

In (643), -kú co-occurs with Change-of-state suffix -dàk ‘COS’. The senses of
370HCompletive -kú and Change-of-state -dàk are closely aligned, and is it very common for
them to co-occur. The overall sense of changed state is basically accomplished in (643)
371Hby -dàk, additional marking in -kú entails a sense that a final state has been reached, and586that no residue from the preceding state is remaining; failure to mark in -kú could imply
that further, different states could be subsequently mentioned or come to obtain.

Unlike most other types of predicate inflection, Completive -kú has the ability toco-occur with Modality suffixes, as in an Imperative clause. The explanation here seems
straightforward; since Imperative suffixes derive historically from primary predicate
inflections, and since Completive -kú co-occurs with primary predicate inflections
(whereas most primary predicate inflections do not co-occur with one another), the
historically prior patterning is retained by the later forms (645).

‘Go ahead and get the big whittled-off hunk of bamboo again.’ (IRW, MPO 047)
In the preceding examples (642)-(645), -kú has been shown following primary aspectual
374H375Hsuffixes and their derivatives. As is also discussed and exemplified in §12.1, -kú also
376H587precedes certain predicate inflections, including Negator -máa ‘NEG’ and Experiential
perfect -bée ‘EPF’. This leads to the establishment of two predicate suffixal positions for
Completive -kú, with different semantic scope effects as exemplified in §12.1 ex. (612)37H378H(613), repeated below for convenience as (646)-(647). Note that -kú may not freely occur
379H3780H3781Hin either position; the early position in (646) is licensed by the presence of Negator -máa;
3782Hif -máa were not present, the resulting predicate *càa-kú-rə́ ‘ascend-CMPL-IRR’ is
ungrammatical. The same applies in (647); in absence of the Irrealis suffix, we cannot
378Hhave *càa-máa-kú ‘ascend-NEG-CMPL’. However, when both positions are licensed, it is in
fact possible to find two iterations of the Completive suffix on the same predicate word;
in (648), note that the first -kú iteration is licensed by the Negator -máa, while the second
3784Hiteration is licensed by Perfect -káa.

‘Going for a walk all together, wearing packs and so on, they forgot the way.’ (lit.,
‘they came to not remember the way anymore’) (IR, FA 009)
In light of examples like (648), it might be tempting to analyse two suffixes with
3785Hthe phonological value -kú, with two different semantic values – perhaps (a) contrast with
588an earlier event/state and (b) completion of an event/state. However, this would not
ultimately seem to be a tenable analysis. As was noted above, the position of -kú – and
the attendant differences in scope effects (which may be responsible for the notionally
“different” semantic values (a) and (b)) – are determined structurally, in terms of cooccurrence with particular predicate inflections. When only one position is licensed, only
one iteration of -kú is licensed – however, according to the context of utterance, either of
the semantic values (a) and (b) may be brought out (649).

Finally, as is also discussed in §13.2.2.1, -kú is homophonous with, and is clearly
378Hsemantically relatable to, a particle kú which occurs as a noun phrase or copula enclitic;
in (650), note that phonological dependence of kú on noun phrase-final article go ‘IND’ –
378Hwhich cannot be analysed as its grammatical head – shows that kú is not a structural
suffix in this usage.

‘That tree branch it seems was not actually a tree.’ (TR, FS 055)
Given these facts, together with the seeming ubiquity of -kú cognates throughout
Tani languages, it seems very likely that (-)kú will reconstruct – probably with the same
phonological value – as a highly versatile, free syntactic particle at the Proto-Tani stage.
As different areas of Galo grammar developed in different ways – notably, as the
predicate phrase syntax seemingly coalesced into a single grammatical word with suffixal
dependents while the noun phrase retained syntactic compositionality (cf. §2.1) – the
3789H589Completive particle was eventually reified in various structural positions. Thus on a
structural basis a clitic/suffix allomorphy is motivated – even if the underlying semantics
may remain essentially unaffected.
12.3.3.2. ‘Direct’ perfective -bá(a)
‘Direct’ perfective -bá(a) ‘PFV.DRCT’ is a relatively infrequent suffix indicating
direct experience of the event depicted in a clause. In declarative sentences, marking
in -bá(a) entails an assertion that the speaker directly experienced the depicted event; in
interrogative sentences, it entails an assumption of the speaker’s that the addressee may
have directly experienced the event. Marking in -bá(a) ‘PFV.DRCT’ also interacts with
‘conjunct/disjunct’ marking, which is discussed in more general terms in the separate
section §12.5; here we focus only on the specific properties of -bá(a).
3790HIn terms of distribution, -bá(a) ‘PFV.DRCT’ is basically unique among predicate
derivations. It cannot directly license a final predicate; *ŋó dó-bá(a) ‘1.SG eat-PFV.DRCT’
is unacceptable in Lare. 232 However, it appears to license a final predicate when occurring
231Ftogether with Completive suffix -kú ‘CMPL’ , as well as with Disjunct suffixes -gée
and -ée – none of which are able to license a final predicate themselves (§12.3.3.1; §12.5)

I have attested relatively few HUMAN PROPENSITY terms, and those terms which
are attested appear in many cases to be derived by metaphor from PHYSICAL PROPERTY
terms (whether basically nominal or adjectival). For example, alùk ‘depressed; forlorn’ is
related to the noun alùk ‘burning/irritating sensation’, reflecting an a-prefixation of lùk‘burning sensation; chili pepper’. Other HUMAN PROPENSITY terms have both nominal and
adjectival uses with basically the same semantic value – one denoting a property and the
other an entity with the property, as peccáa ‘fool(ish)’. However, the majority of HUMAN
PROPENSITY concepts by far are encoded by Manner predicate derivations – many if notmost of which have adjectivalizing functionality, as mə́ə-kèn ‘think-GOOD/EASY’ ‘happy’
or mə́ə-cə́k ‘think-BOLDLY’ ‘bold; straightforward and unhesitating’ (both of which may
be used as adjectives). For further discussion of Manner predicate derivations, see
§11.2.1.
204H5.2.3.9. Speed
Very few SPEED terms are attested. dəmə́ə ‘slow’ is a basic adjective, while -báa
‘FAST’ is a Manner predicate derivation with limited adjectivalizing capability. In some
subdialects, a probably recent formation bɨɨbáa (seemingly reflecting bɨ ́i- ‘swell; fill up’
+ -báa ‘FAST’) has the generalized sense ‘fast’, although not all speakers use (or even
particularly appreciate) this word. Certainly, a large number of younger speakers prefer
the recent Indic loan zoldi ‘fast’, which has been borrowed into foothills Galo as an
adjective. Degrees of speed are seemingly not lexicalized in Galo, although numerous
248periphrastic modifications of basic SPEED terms are of course possible (including various
adverbial and particle emphatics, and also onomatopoeia; see §13.7.7).
205H5.2.3.10. Difficulty
DIFFICULTY is not robustly lexicalized in Galo. The single attested term is an
adjectivalizing Manner predicate derivation -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY’, which may have the sense
‘good (to do V)’ or ‘easy (to do V)’, according to the semantics of the situation. For
example, dó-kèn ‘eat-GOOD/EASY’ generally has the sense ‘delicious’ (lit., ‘good to eat’),
but in a situation in which the relative difficulty of eating a particular kind of food (or
using a particular type of utensil, such as chopsticks) is under discussion, the sense may
be ‘easy to eat (with)’. Difficulty (lack of ease) is expressed by the same form in negative
polarity, as dó-kèn-máa ‘eat-GOOD/EASY-NEG’ ‘not nice to eat’. This situation is basically
parallel with that of VALUE terms (cf. §5.2.3.5).
206H5.2.3.11. Similarity
Basic SIMILARITY values are expressed by basic adjectives adə́k ‘different’ andləjɨ ́ɨ ‘similar; same’. The default sense is of implied similarity, as ‘S/CS is the same
as/different from (something else)’; monoclausal comparisons among two items are
handled by coordination of the S argument noun phrase, with reflexive marking on the
predicate (71).

5.2.3.12. Position
POSITION terms functioning as adjectives in Galo generally also occur as nouns, asnəcì ‘vicinity; near’ and adòo ‘distance; distant’. There are few if any POSITION terms
which are exclusively adjectival; most often, relative position of an entity is referenced
using a deictic demonstrative, of which there is a very rich system in Galo (§7.4).
208H2495.2.4. Verb class semantics and subclassification
5.2.4.1. Overview
There are fewer verb roots as a percentage of lexemes overall in Galo than may be
typical across languages. The principal reason for this appears to be the richness of the
system of predicate derivations (§11). Although the core semantics of most types of event
209H– concepts such as ‘speak’, ‘see’, ‘eat’ and ‘make’ – are handled by lexical verb roots in
Galo, many aspects of event/state manner, temporal/procedural structure, degree of
realization and other related concepts which may be lexicalized as a inherent features of
verb roots in other languages are often handled separately by productively stemexpanding predicate derivations in Galo. This is not an absolute generalization – for
example, there is a very large set of ‘cut’ type verbs in Galo, most of which have
lexicalized distinctions related to manner, result and/or type of entity affected – but it is
fairly noticeable all the same.
The basic subclassification of Galo verbs is in terms of transitivity, by which is
meant the number of participants for which the event or state depicted by a verb is
underlyingly specified, as well as the semantic roles which are assigned to them. A more
detailed discussion of the overall derivation from verb semantics to grammatical marking
of participant noun phrases at the clause level may be found in §14.1; here we mention
210Honly basic lexical-semantic features of verb roots.
In Galo, verbs may be atransitive, intransitive, transitive or extended
atransitive/intransitive/transitive, as well as ambitransitive (S=A and S=O). Atransitive
verbs do not subcategorize for any obligatory arguments.

cases, event semantics line up closely with particular transitivity classes; for example,
verbs of Position such as dùu- ‘sit’ and dàk- ‘stand’ are always intransitive. In other cases,
semantic types cut across transitivity classes. For example, among verbs of locution, we
find extended intransitive mèn- ‘speak’, transitive gók- ‘call (someone)’, and extended
transitive záp- ‘talk (about something to someone)’. Sometimes, a single verb may have
multiple senses, with multiple transitivity specifications, while yet retaining a unified
semantic core; ə́m- is such a verb, with extended atransitive (‘be said (that)’), transitive
(‘say something’), and extended transitive (‘tell someone something’) senses.
In what follows, we will not attempt to take either a strictly transitivity-oriented
approach or a strictly event-semantically-oriented approach, since the scope of the
enquiry in either case would exceed that of this work. Instead, we simply identify a
number of verbal subclasses which have salient, important or unique characteristics in
some sense, and whose elucidation will aid in comprehension of other aspects of the
grammar. A fuller study of the Galo verbal lexicon remains under preparation.
5.2.4.2. Motion
Galo motion verbs are either activity-oriented or goal-oriented. Activity-oriented
motion verbs are basically intransitive. Goal-oriented motion verbs are extended
intransitive, subcategorizing for an Actor S and an E argument Goal (Source arguments
are Oblique/non-core). Marking and syntax of motion verbs at the clause level is
discussed in §9.2.2.4.1. Goal-oriented motion verbs lexicalize directionality on three
21Htopographical planes – upward sloping, downward sloping and on the same (or an
unknown) level – as well as relationship to a deictic center and relationship to a
confining space. Sometimes, the same verb participates in one or more semantic
paradigms; in some cases, this reflects an inherent polysemy between goal-oriented and
activity-oriented senses (as with ín- ‘walk; go (to)’ and áa- ‘come; enter; move on the
same/unknown level’). Table 5.24 presents the set of goal-oriented, directionally21Hspecified motion verbs. Activity-oriented motion verbs are in Table 5.25-Table 5.26.

through water per se. For example, a fish cannot perform zàa-, apparently because it has no limbs. Instead, afish must perform də̀p- ‘cruise’, which is the same motion performed by a soaring bird or plane, or a
speeding vehicle.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"
"490Often – and particularly among verbs of cognition and perception – -pàa is found
indicating attainment of a resulting state which is often lexicalized in a suppletive verbal
form in English (though not in most Asian languages), as mə́ə-pàa ‘think-ATTN’
‘remember’, káa-pàa ‘look-ATTN’ ‘see’, èn-pàa ‘feel-ATTN’ ‘notice’, tá-pàa ‘listen-ATTN’
‘hear’, and má-pàa ‘search for-ATTN’ ‘find’.
Marking in -pàa is particularly common in negative polarity clauses; in this case,
its effect is to indicate that although the activity denoted by the predicate is initiated, its
realization is somehow imperfect or incomplete. In (448), the A argument referent (in this
32Hcase the speaker) has clearly initiated an event of ‘thinking’, but is unable to fully or
completely bring the thought on or about which he intends to think (referent of the
underlying O argument) fully to mind.

‘Up there...now what was it (called)? I’ve forgotten yet again.’ (TB, OAM 218)11.2.1.4. Argument structure
The argument structure of a predicate stem expanded by a Manner or Result
derivation may be the same as or different from the argument structure of the head root.
Often, the valence of a transitive stem may be reduced through Manner derivation; in
many if not all cases, this can be viewed as a process of adjectivalization, as discussed in
§11.2.4.2; for example, the Manner derivation -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY’ raises the underlying O
324Hof a transitive verb to S (deleting the A), as in dó-kèn ‘eat-GOOD/EASY’ ‘good/easy to eat’.
The resulting word may be used as a derived adjective with the sense ‘delicious (of a
Patient of eating)’, and occurs as an intransitive predicate or in any other syntactic context
in which adjectivals occur (cf. also §5.2.3).
325HValence may also be restructured by means of a Manner or, more often, Result
derivation. In (449), note that aapùk ‘heart’ stands as O argument of ìn- ‘cut by sliding
326Hacross a fixed blade’, and that ɲíi heads the O argument of the adverbially subordinated
predicate in dó- ‘eat’. However, ɲíi is not a Patient of ‘eat’, despite that this is the
491semantic role ordinarily assigned to the O argument of ‘eat’; rather, the Result derivation-pɨ ́ɨ ‘SATISFY.O’ appears to govern the semantic role of the O argument.

“Cut this heart such that it’s enough for everyone to eat.” (MK, TT 203)
Interestingly, Result derivation -pɨ ́ɨ ‘SATISFY.O’ has a counterpart in the S=O
ambitransitive verb pɨ ́ɨ- ‘suffice; satisfy’. In its transitive use, pɨ ́ɨ- subcategorizes for an
Experiencer O – ordinarily, a person who experiences satisfaction by means of the A
argument referent. Seemingly, then, the argument structure of the adverbially
subordinated predicate in (449) is more directly associable to the Result derivation than to
327Hthe verb root.
This fact notwithstanding, it is not always possible to describe the argument
structure of a derived predicate in terms of the argument structure of a possibly cognate
root. In (450), the result derivation -zíK ‘MELT.S/O’ is presumably relatable to the verb
328Hroot zíK- ‘melt’. However, the verb root is intransitive only. Thus, the transitive argument
structure of the predicate in (450) is not describable in terms of a direct importation from
329Hthe argument structure of a lexical source root.

‘The sun melted the plastic.’ (MN, B2:119)
Ultimately, the interactions of various Manner and Result derivations with theargument structures of various types of root is a complex matter which must be described
on a case-by-case basis. Although such a comprehensive description exceeds the scope of
this thesis, I have hopes that it will be able to be undertaken in a future work.","[490, 491, 492]"

1.1. Overview
The following work is a descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of Galo, 1 a
language of the Tani branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family which is spoken in
central Arunachal Pradesh state, North-East India. It is the first ever attempt at a
comprehensive description of the grammar of Galo, or, for that matter, of any Tani
language. It is designed to serve three main purposes. First, it is designed to serve as a
partial historical record of the Galo language as it was spoken in the early 21st century.
For reasons that will be discussed, no extant document yet comes close to serving this
purpose. Second, it is designed to serve as a reference for linguists, anthropologists, and
other scholars engaged in comparative language typology, or with other interests in
languages and cultures of the region. Third, and perhaps most importantly, it is designed
to serve as a foundation from which further descriptive, documentary and pedagogical
materials may be developed to aid in the preservation and maintenance of the Galo
language, for the benefit of future generations of Galo people.
Although the primary focus in this work will fall consistently on the Lare dialect
of Galo, in light of the extreme paucity of documentary and descriptive materials for Tani
languages in general, references will be made to certain other Galo dialects and certain
other Tani languages where possible and relevant to the discussion; this is as much in aid
of situating Lare Galo in typological relation to its relatives and neighbours as it will be –
I hope – in aid of furthering broader linguistic studies in this extremely interesting and
very much neglected area of the linguistic world.
In this chapter, the following subsections provide a contextual overview of Galo
language and culture (§1.2), followed by a review of relevant works by other scholars
(§1.3), a discussion of the theoretical framework in terms of which this study is conducted
(§1.4) and a description of my fieldwork and analytical methodologies (§1.5). §1.6 and
§1.7 finally discuss conventions and the structure of this work in more detail.
1Except where relevant to address a particular point, I adopt the convention throughout this work of
referring to major tribal, language and dialect names in running text using the simplified romanizations
which are most likely to be encountered elsewhere in print, despite that these are often at odds with their
pronunciations in Lare Galo – the latter, for example, being pronounced larèe galòo by the Lare Galo
themselves. Most Galo proper names, clan names and village names are referred-to using the Lare Galo
pronunciation; where a particular village name may have a relatively well-known and dissimilar
romanization, this is given in parentheses, as daarɨ ̀ɨ (Daring) village of West Siang District. Where a nonLare pronunciation of a Galo word is referenced, the dialect is always identified; where a word is simply
identified as “Galo” (without mentioning a specific dialect), pronunciation may be assumed to be basically
the same across dialects, to the extent that I have been able to determine.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"
"616Argument noun phrase-modifying particles may be subdivided into three major
position classes – Types 1a and 1b, which have the potential to co-occur in an ordered
sequence, and Type 2, which supplants both of Types 1a and 1b (Table 13.3). Uncertainty
391Hexists where particles are less-frequently attested and/or where their use is dispreferred by
some speakers; forms with less certain distribution are marked by: (?). An example of
ordered sequencing is given in (708).

13.2.2.1. Completive kú
Completive particle kú is a clear cognate of Completive predicate inflection -kú
(§12.3.3.1); the ultimate etymology of -kú/kú is currently unknown, but almost certainly
3921Hdates at least to the Proto-Tani stage. Completive particle kú marks noun phrases whose
referents are construed as ‘now’, ‘ultimately’ or ‘finally’ participating in the predicated
event/state, often as their (possibly anticipated) participation marks an episodic boundary,
turning point or termination of a series of events. Completive particle kú often interacts
with predicate marking in -kú (709); however, the two forms are non-redundant, and are
392Hthus not reducible to an instance of aspectual concord (710).

‘It came up to here. Then from here, it went up to here, eh.’ (LN, TG 053)13.2.2.2. Additive cìn and kòm
Additive cìn (Pugo sìn) is a common, versatile particle with the basic function of
indicating participation in a predicated event/state ‘also’, ‘as well (as)’ or ‘in addition
(to)’ another known referent (711).
3924H(711) ŋoocîn inrә́!ŋó=cìn ín-rә́
1.SG=ADD go-IRR
‘I too will go (in addition to all of you).’ (IR, OLB3:33)cìn ‘ADD’ also commonly occurs in the ‘Additive co-participant’ construction, in
which it marks both co-participating referents (schematically, I also went and he also
went; see Conjunctive/Additive coordination in §16.3.1.1). It also quite commonly occurs
3925Hin a “Dismissive” construction. In this construction, the Additive particle follows an
interrogative/indefinite pronoun in a negative polarity clause, indicate that ‘none’ or ‘not
any’ of a set of qualifying referents in fact participate in the predicated event/state (712).
3926HFor several further examples, see the individual sections on interrogative/indefinite
pronouns in §7.3.

‘He didn’t say anything at all to them.’ (IR, FA 091)
618cìn ‘ADD’ is one of a very small set of versatile particles with the ability to
“interrupt” a predicate complex (§13.5.3), and also occurs as a formative of Concessive
3928Hcoordinator (-)la(a)cìn (§13.2.1; §16.3.2.2). It also has the ability to stand as a
392H390Hclefting/focalizing particle. The etymology of cìn ‘ADD’ is unknown.
Additive kòm is believed to be a Minyong loan (possibly entering via Pugo Galo),
and its use as a simple Additive particle, replacing native Galo cìn ‘ADD’in examples like
(711) and (712), is frowned on by many of my Lare consultants. Be that as it may, kòm is
391H392Hwell-established in Lare Galo as a formative of Concessive coordinator (-)dakkòm ‘CONC’
(§16.3.1.3), and it has been attested as an (albeit infrequent) alternative to cìn ‘ADD’ in
39Hcertain constructions (cf. §7.3.3.2).
394H13.2.2.3. Implicit comparison dèn
Implicit comparison dèn ‘ICMP’ marks noun phrases whose referents are viewed as
implicitly ‘under comparison’ with another referent, in terms of their participation, or
fitness for participation, in the predicated event/state. It is sometimes translatable via
English ‘rather’ or ‘though’ (713)-(714).

predicates/clauses, and does not have clefting/focalizing capability. Its etymology is

13.2.2.4. Contrastive da
Contrastive da is a very common and versatile particle, which may be reflected in
a series of more or less homophonous and functionally similar forms or formatives in
both the noun phrase and predicate areas of the grammar. Its basic and most frequent
function is to mark a referent as contrasting with another, previously mentioned referent.
Often, this can take the form of a switch-topic function, with a sense not unlike English
‘(and/but) as for [NP]…’, and frequently marks a first person pronoun when a speaker
wishes to interject a personal opinion (716).

‘As for me, (I’m) thinking about (what to do about) the roof.’ (IR, HC 008)
Not all noun phrases marked in da are topics, however; furthermore, the sense of‘contrast’ seems to be thematically governed, as opposed to being a pure marker of
referential discontinuity per se. In (717), da marks a speech report argument as
39Hcontrasting thematically with the previously mentioned predicate.","[616, 617, 618, 619, 620]"

The set of forms described in this section have identical or closely similar
distribution, and share the unusual phonological property of allowing either high
(unmarked) or rising-falling (emphatic) tonal realizations (cf. §4.2.2.2.1). They very often
413H“reset” the boundary of a phonological phrase (meaning that preceding Low/Tense words
occur with a phonetically low contour – as would normally be the case in a phrase-final
context – rather than with a Rising(-Falling) tone – as would normally be the case in a
phrase-medial context). All adverbial particles occur in morphosyntactic positions which
suggest co-membership in other form-classes; this may be viewed by the analyst either as
a property of their morphological class, or as a case of historical change and (then)
homophony among distinct lexical items. In either case, there is a clear semantic core to
each form, and native Galo speakers certainly view their cross-categorical manifestations
as instances of “the same form”. Adverbial particles are semantically more complex than
versatile particles with formative i, and are often translated via lexical adjectives or
adverbs in Indo-European languages. However, it is important to note that they bear
neither the structural nor the distributional properties of Galo adjectives or adverbs (as
they have been defined in this grammar), and cannot be reduced to either class.
13.5.2.1. Delimiting ɲúm ~ ɲûm
Delimiting ɲúm ~ ɲûm has the basic function of delimiting a preceding
constituent as ‘itself and nothing more’. It is almost always translatable via English only,
although depending on context it may be more felicitously translated via just, nothing
but/more than, etc. With respect to the noun phrase grammar, Delimiting ɲúm has been
665attested both phrase-internally – preceding phrasal enclitics, postpositions, and particles –
and phrase-externally – following enclitics and postpositions, but preceding (other)
particles (819)-(820).

With respect to predicate grammar, ɲúm generally occurs within the predicate
complex. Unlike versatile particles which are based on formative i (§13.5.1), ɲúm is able
413Hto occur inside a phonological word (821), as well as at the margins; in the latter case, it

Reality záa ~ zâa has the basic function of marking a preceding constituent as real
or factual – perhaps contrary to some standing expectation – and may be translated by
English real(ly), tru(ly), authentic(ally), actual(ly) or without doubt. In some uses, it may
have an intensifying function which is closer to the intensifying senses of English really,
truly, considerably or (very) much (so).
With respect to the noun phrase grammar, Reality záa may precede or follow
phrasal enclitics (postpositions, articles or demonstratives) (823)-(824).

13.5.2.3. Certainty rúu ~ rûu
Certainty rúu ~ rûu has the basic function of marking a constituent as certain,
definite(ly the case), doubtless or unquestionable, in preference to any other potential
referent, event or manner, etc. Like other “adverbial” particles, it may occur NP-internally,
preceding enclitics/postpositions and/or demonstratives, or it may follow them (829)413H(830).

In a seeming extension of the superlative use of Certainty rúu ~ rûu when
following -jàa ‘COMP’, a particle expressing ‘High certainty’ jaarûu has been observed to
mark noun phrases. Although this may appear to provide evidence for the Particle status
of Intensifier -jàa ‘COMP’ – as well as for the Superlative sequence -jàa≡rûu ‘COMP≡CERT’
as exemplified in (832) (discussed in §11.2.5.11), it is important to note that, unlike
418H419Hjaarûu, -jàa ‘COMP’ cannot occur independently outside of the predicate word. This would
suggest that ‘High certainty’ jaarûu may derived from reanalysis of the predicate
superlative sequence -jàa≡rûu ‘COMP≡CERT’ as a free syntactic operator (833). This
4150Hdevelopment may have been encouraged by the frequent occurrence of -jàa≡rûu ‘COMP

Dubitative larèe ‘DUB’ has the same distribution as Polar interrogative ree. It
indicates speaker surprise at seeing an indication that the marked information is or should
be the case, and forms an insistent polar question to verify whether it is or is not so (in
principle, probably expecting a negative answer) (791). In cases where the speaker and
4083Haddressee both know quite well that the marked information is not and can not be the case,
the sense is closer to a rhetorical question, possibly with disapproving and/or mirative
overtones; if (792) were marked in simple Polar interrogative particle ree ‘PQ’, it would
408Hinappropriately suggest the speaker’s earnest ignorance as to whether or not his addressee
(in this case his son) was in fact insane.

Assumptive interrogative rem marks information whose truth/falsity is unknown

entails a speaker assumption concerning the addressee’s knowledge, it forms a fairly
impatient or insistent-sounding type of question. Although it appears that Assumptive
interrogative rem must derive from Polar interrogative ree plus a following formative m –
which, in turn may reflect either Temporal subordinator әәm, Resolutive m or some (other)
reflex of a PT object-marker *m – Assumptive interrogative rem can mark both polar and
content cleft interrogative clauses (793)-(794).

provisional hypotheses, it must be emphasized that a great deal more research on the630functions and distribution of declarative particles should be undertaken prior to making
any very firm claims.
Examples (740)-(741) illustrate the position classes.

Reportative juu marks information as having been in some way ‘reported’ to the
speaker. This includes information which was overheard by the speaker, told directly to
the speaker, signalled in some way to the speaker or to someone else, or which was in
some other way derived from the communicative performance of another individual.

‘“We’ll just have to go (down and) find out,” he said.’ (TB, OAM 259)When marking a verb of locution as in (745), it is often difficult to determine whether juu
391H‘REP’ is marking the information contained in the speech report as reported (he said that,
it is reported information), or whether juu ‘REP’ it in fact marks the overall clause
(including the speech verb) as reported information (he said that, so they say). In
principle – according to my consultants – both interpretations are possible, and context
seemingly enables listeners to know which sense of juu ‘REP’ is intended. However, since
most examples in my corpus in which juu ‘REP’ co-occurs with a speech verb are found in
folktales – in which, in principle, all information has been overheard – it has been
difficult to isolate the condition using natural data; additional research is required.
The historical source of Reportative juu is unknown.
13.3.2.1.2. Evidential ben
Evidential ben marks information as inferred on the basis of evidence, usually of a
physical nature, viewed as the tangible result of some event which the speaker did not
himself witness or learn about in any other more direct way. ben is usually best translated
632by English seems, except that, unlike the latter, it does not mark statements of deduction
from facts. In (746), the speaker has not actually seen any ‘people’, but views light
392Hemerging from a house as a sign that people are likely to be present; failure to mark inben would suggest that the speaker has in fact seen the people, or has some other more
direct form of access to the information.

13.3.2.1.3. Uncertainty pә̀
‘Uncertainty’ pә̀ indicates that the speaker is uncertain of the truth of the marked
assertion, but is prepared to assert its possibility or plausibility, probably on the basis of
deduction from facts (rather than from evidence, e.g.). pә̀ ‘UCRT’ is most often translatable
via English may or might. In (747), marking in pə̀ ‘UCRT’ allows the speaker to assert his
39Hbelief that ‘chopping’ is a real possibility, but at the same time his uncertainty that it will
indeed come to pass; failure to mark in pә̀ ‘UCRT’ would indicate that the speaker has full
confidence in ‘chopping’ coming to pass, and imply that he has some inside or firsthand
knowledge that allows him to speak with certainty.

Mirative la(a)ka indicates a speaker attitude of surprise or astonishment, usually at
the information reported in the marked clause, but potentially also at the addressee in
connection with some aspect of the marked information. In (748), the speaker is reacting
395Hin astonishment and disapproval at an event unfolding as he speaks, of which the
addressee was also an uninvolved witness. In (749), the speaker is not astonished at his
396Hown ‘speaking’, but rather at his addressee for his lack of awareness in asking him to
discuss something which has already been discussed.

13.3.2.1.5. Predictive lapә̀
Predictive lapә̀ is a seeming extension of modal complementizer of Conjunct
intentional inflection -lapә̀ (§12.4.2.8). Its function is to cast information as outside the
39H634speaker’s direct experience, but about which the speaker is prepared to make a prediction
of truth on the basis of personal knowledge and judgement (750).

Purposive əmlàa compositionally reflects ə́m-là(a) ‘say-NF’, in the anaphoricallyreferring, complementizer-like function of this verb which is described more generally in
§16.7. As a seemingly recently-evolved particle, əmlàa occurs clause-finally, and also as
40Ha marker of cleft/focal NPs. While at least some clause-final uses, such as in (752), could
405Hconceivably be analysed as syntactically compositional (and the overall construction
therefore bi-clausal), it is clear that the particle analysis is required for examples like
(753). In no other case can a non-final predicate or clause license a cleft/focus structure,
406Hwhich is a function open only to syntactic particles in Galo; (754) demonstrates the
407Hungrammaticality of a non-final predicate in rɨ ̀- as focalizing particle of a cleft structure.
For discussion of the syntax of cleft/focus constructions, see §9.4.

13.3.2.2.1. Simple declarative na
Simple declarative na ‘DECL’ is one of the most frequent Lare Galo morphemes. 246
245FWhen following the inflected predicate of a final clause or a copula, it has the basic
speech-act functional value ‘I’m telling you this’. While not grammatically obligatory on
a declarative clause per se, its use appears to communicate the speaker’s confidence in the
validity of his assertion, and to enhance the addressee’s confidence in the speaker’s
knowledge accordingly (755). Simple declarative na marks appositive declarative clauses
409Hmore often than it does not in my corpus; it may be that na is in the process of developing
as a marker of the appositive clause focus (cf. §9.4).

disagreements would sometimes arise over Simple declarative particle use, with Lare speakers often
dispreferring Pugo declarative sentences which more often lacked a declarative particle, and vice versa.

Disjunctive NP-coordination in declarative moods is not well-attested, with mostattested cases of semantic alternation in my corpus handled by NP-internal headcoordinations (see §6.2.3). The structure most often returned in elicitation involves a
2496Hdistinct coordinator maarə́m, which probably derives historically from the
sequence -máa-rə́=əəm ‘-NEG-IRR=ACC’; literally, ‘in the unreal/hypothetical negative’ or

Disjunctive NP-coordination can thus be described in terms of two basic structural
types – one involving sequential, non-coreferential NPs, in which each NP is marked by an
epistemic particle, and the other in which a disjunctive coordinator marks the alternation
– and a third type, defined as a hybrid of types 1-2 (Figure 6.6-Figure 6.8).

250H2506H6.3.1. “Afterthought” NPs
An “afterthought” NP is one which immediately, or closely, follows another,
coreferential NP. The usual function of an afterthought NP is to provide some information
which was not contained in the first NP, either because the speaker neglected to include it
or because inclusion might lead to construction of an over-heavy or difficult-to-process
constituent (145)-(146). Note that although “afterthought” NPs may also occur post2507H2508Hverbally – usually, though not obligatorily, set off by an intonational pause – such
constructions are less frequent in my corpus than are the appositional types described in
this section.

6.3.2. Referential qualifying expressions
Referential qualifying expressions consist of one “primary” NP and one following,
apposed “qualifying” NP (Figure 6.10). The primary NP is responsible for the primary
2509Hsemantic value of the expression, while the qualifying NP limits, extends, or in some more
general way modifies its referential scope.
315[[NP]PRIMARY [NP]QUALIFYING]
Figure 6.10 – Structure of a referential qualifying expressionAlthough both the primary and the qualifying NP are well-formed noun phrases
with the potential for independent reference, in a referential qualifying expression both
NPs work together within the same clausal argument position to project a combinedoverall referential value. In (147), donám-tɨɨnám ‘food and drink’ and nəgɨ ̀ɨ ‘variety’ are
2510Hboth marked by a noun phrase-final Topic marker – and are thus both clearly noun
phrases rather than simply nominals – and each has the potential to stand as an
independently-referential clause argument. However, in this referential qualifying
expression nəgɨ ̀ɨ ‘variety’ qualifies the reference of donám-tɨɨnám ‘food and drink’ to
indicate that ‘every kind’ of food and drink is under discussion. Together, both NPs
constitute the S argument of dóo- ‘be there (INAN)’. In (148), buppɨ ̂ɨ ‘everyone’ modifies
251Hnunù ‘2.PL’ to underscore a sense that all of the referenced entities, without exception, is
equally affected as O argument of the predicate.

The qualifying NP of a referential qualifying expression is usually drawn from theavailable set of Galo qualifying nouns (§8.3). Other common uses of referential qualifier
251Hexpressions include formation of autonomous activity expressions via the
autonomous/reflexive noun aɨ ́ɨ ‘body; self’ (149) (cf. §7.2.1 and §11.2.5.9 for broader
2513H2514H251Hdiscussions of the basic constructions), as well as so-called inclusory constructions, which
are formed via postposition of a non-singular (dual or plural) pronoun to a common
nominal or proper name. The latter in particular may be a source construction for NPinternal demonstrative uses of pronouns; for further discussion on this point, see §7.1.5.2.

‘My father and his bunch would have known.’ (LN, MF 131)6.3.3. Apposition, afterthoughts, extraction and intonation
Most of the examples presented in §6.3.1-§6.3.2 represent clear cases of NP
2517H2518Happosition, in which both apposed NPs carry phrase-final enclitics and yet clearly refer to
the same entity or group. However, the data may not always be so straightforwardly
analysed. In particular, since the majority of NP constituents can themselves stand either
as a nominal NP head or license a headless NP, it is sometimes difficult when encountering
a particular sequence of candidate NP constituents or heads to determine whether we are
dealing with one continuous NP, a sequence of two apposed NPs, or one NP followed by an
extracted constituent (or perhaps an NP with a non-prototypical order). For example, in
(146) above (§6.3.1), does the sequence əgə̀…buppɨ ̂ɨ əgə̀ ‘ANAP.IND…everyone
2519H250HANAP.IND’ necessarily represent a case of NP apposition – one NP consisting only of apronominal demonstrative followed by another NP consisting of a noun-demonstrative
sequence – or might it be simply one NP, with a “bracketed” demonstrative and an internal
intonational pause?
Although the above sections have attempted to lay out the set of possible
structures encountered in the construction of Galo noun phrases, it should be emphasized
that these structures sometimes overlap, and it may be undesirable or even impossible in
some cases to forcibly reduce certain sequences to a case of NP-internal structuring, on the
one hand, or to one of an NP sequence, on the other. In fact, it seems likely that the
prevalence of NP-apposition in Galo and its important set of functions may itself have
given rise to the particular set of NP structures that we find, including features such as
demonstrative “bracketing” (which may have evolved from a prosodic tightening of
“afterthought” NP apposition such as in (146)) and post-head nominal enumeration and
251Hqualification (which may have evolved from referential qualifying expressions such as the
examples in §6.3.2). It will be instructive indeed to eventually learn whether Tani
25H317languages with different possibilities for NP apposition and coordination than those
reviewed here for Galo, do or do not have correspondingly differently-evolved internal
noun phrase structures. This would seem to be a potentially fruitful area for continuing
research.","[312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318]"
"Appositive coordination
Appositive clause-coordination is based on a structural apposition between twofinite, potentially independent clauses (Figure 16.2).
4637H[FINAL CLAUSE][(COORDINATOR)][FINAL CLAUSE]
Figure 16.2 – Appositive coordination16.2.1. Parallel structures
The most basic type of appositive clause-coordination is based on structural
parallelism among two apposed final clauses. Minimally, this consists of shared final
predicate marking (including TAM specification), and often also includes shared or
similar argument structures and/or adverbial modifications, as well as similar or
thematically relatable predicate semantics. In absence of any other marking and when
both clauses are matched in polarity, the function derived from parallel-structured
apposition is generally restatement, as when providing an alternative or supplementary
view on the same event. In (1051), a character in a folktale is describing the
4638Hdisappearance of a chicken liver which had been entrusted to her care. The liver’s falling
and loss are thus two ways of viewing that same event, and are each expressed by way of
an individual clause. Note that both predicates are headed by intransitive verb roots, and
that they share the same subject, Completive aspectual marking and Direct (experienced)
perfective aspectual marking.

16.2.2. Prosodic marking
Particular coordinative functions are also achieved in Galo through distinct types
of clause-level prosodic marking, whose markers are phonetically realized on the final
syllable nucleus of the last phonological word of a final clause. Such prosodic marking is
notable for overriding both the lexically-specified tone of a particular phonological word
and the “boundary” (lowering) tone which by default marks the termination of most Galo
final clauses (§4.2.2.3.2).
461H16.2.2.1. Non-final intonation type 1: “list” intonation
“List” intonation consists of a marked rise (without fall) in pitch, symbolized _́́
and glossed NFI1 (Non-Final Intonation type 1). The function of list intonation is to
indicate that the information contained in the marked clause is but one of several related
information units (for example, micro-activities within an overall macro-task, or
individual existential predications of entities which are construed to occur as a set); most
often, list environments also exploit parallel syntactic structures (§16.2.1) (1053).

‘And after pounding the paddy...they prepare food (and)...they (also) prepare rice
beer (and so on)... After doing that…(etc.)’ (LN, GMW, 005-007)
In (1053), note that the lexically-specified intonation contour of modù ‘make46HIPFV’ is downward, but that this is overridden by the list intonation marker. Note also that785the sentence-bounding phonological word in each of the list-marked clauses is not subject
to boundary-related downstepping (§4.2.2.3.2). Finally, note both that parallel predicate
465H(syntactic and thematic) structures are exploited by the construction, and that the speaker,
in not terminating the “list” with a final clause in declarative sentence intonation, implies
that more such clauses could well be stated (i.e., that the referenced actors in fact engage
in many more, similar, activities, which the speaker here declines to mention).
16.2.2.2. Non-final intonation type 2: “follow-on” intonation“Follow-on” intonation consists of a marked rise-and-fall in pitch, symbolized _̂
and glossed NFI2 (Non-Final Intonation type 2). Its function is to indicate that the
information contained in the marked clause has a specific implication, which is to be
mentioned in the following clause (1054).

‘Then, “the Paadam will surely come; [accordingly,] they’ll kill us,” he said.’
(TB, OAM 280-281)
Follow-on information intonation is phonetically identical (if spoken in isolation)
to the “rising-falling” intonation characterizing the “pitch peak” of a low/tense
phonological word in Galo (§4.2.2). However, since the normal conventions of Galo
467Hprosody never lead to a full (non-downstepped) realization of a rising-falling pitch over
the final syllable of an utterance, follow-on intonation is always prosodically contrastive.
Note that the construction exemplified in (1054) also exploits parallel morphosyntactic
468Hstructures, however this is not necessary (1055).

The most general Galo imperative is in -tó, a form which appears to derive
historically from Perfective suffix -tó (§12.3.2.4). Most often, imperative predicates in -tó
382Hare either subsequently marked by an appropriate hortative or tag particle (667), or else
3824Hexhibit stem derivation in Tentative -káa (basically with the distancing sense ‘try to’; see
§11.2.3.1) (666). Imperatives in -tó obligatorily have a second person subject (singular,
3825H3826Hdual or plural), which may be overt or, far more often, is ellipsed.

‘Get the bamboo, yeah? After that, get the small one also.’ (IR, MPO 005)
Imperative -tó only very rarely occurs alone, with speakers possibly preferring
additional hortative marking to avoid confusion with the homophonous Perfective suffix.
However, in high-context situations (as when giving an extended set of directions), such
uses are possible (668). It is also possible – like the Perfective suffix – to find an
3827Himperative in -tó marked by Non-final suffix -là(a) ‘NF’, and forming an element of an
(all-imperative) clause chain (669). Such uses appear to have given rise to a ‘light’
382Himperative with the form of a non-final marked perfective predicate; an imperative
in -tó-là(a) ‘IPTV.ODIR-NF’ is used in friendly, reassuring moods, similar to American
English y’all (x) now, y’hear? (670).

An imperative in -tó is used in cases when the commanded activity does notdirectly affect or benefit the speaker; it is ‘other-directed’. When the speaker is construed
as directly benefiting from or as being otherwise affected by an activity commanded of a
second person subject, the predicate is marked in ‘self-directed’ imperative -là(a) –
possibly a derivative of the Non-final suffix -là(a) ‘NF’ (§16.4.2). The difference is most
380Hclearly expressed in a minimal pair (671)-(672); in (672), note also that Self-directed
381H382H38Himperative -là(a) exhibits Phrase-medial truncation (§4.1.5.2), surfacing with a short
384Hrhyme:

say-BEN-IPTV.SDIR=HORT.POL
‘Tell me (*him/her/it) your name!’ (IR, 22:13)
Imperatives in -tó may be formed upon any verb stem, but may not be formed onadjectival stems. Imperatives in -là(a) may only be formed on transitive and extended
intransitive/transitive stems. In a transitive imperative in -là(a), the O argument referent
must be speaker-coreferential (673). In an extended intransitive/transitive imperative, the
385Hspeaker-coreferential argument is E (672).

Inclusive hortatives (let’s/shall we/why don’t we) are also formed in ‘self-directed’imperative -là(a). In this case, marking in the Inclusive hortative particle zù is obligatory
(see also §13.3.1.2), and the subject is obligatorily first person non-singular (dual or
387Hplural) (674).

Prohibitive -jó ‘PROH’ forms a negative imperative with the basic sense don’t do
(PRED); subjects of a prohibitive imperative are obligatorily second person (any number),
and may be overt or, more often, are ellipsed (675)-(676). The origin of -jó ‘PROH’ is
389Hcurrently unknown.","[597, 598, 599, 600]"

This work is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of
Galo, a Tibeto-Burman language of the Tani branch spoken in central Arunachal Pradesh
State, in the North-East Indian Himalaya. It is based on primary data obtained from
original fieldwork conducted by the author in Galo towns and villages in Arunachal
Pradesh. In addition to description of the synchronic phonology and grammar of Lare
Galo, it contains a historical overview and preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Galo
segmental phonology, in addition to a glossary of approximately 1,300 lexical roots with
4,000 lexical exemplars and three fully analyzed texts.

In running text, grammatically bound lexical roots are notated with a final hyphen,
as cèn- ‘know’. Free words (including clitics) are presented with no hyphen, as hottúm
‘bear’ and əə ‘TOP’. Suffixes and other word-level grammatical dependents (such as
predicate derivations, which may be alternatively analysed as more-or-less suffixlike or
rootlike; see §11.1) are noted with an initial hyphen, as -máa ‘NEG’. Lexical compounds
are connected by a hyphen, as hottúm-horə́; where possible, both formatives are glossed,
followed by an overall translation, as hottúm-horə́ ‘bear-boar’ ‘wild animal’. Where the
meanings of one or both of the individual formatives are unknown, only the overall
translation is given, as təəkóm-pətə̀k ‘popping beetle’. Discontinuous lexical entries
(lexemes or functors which constitute a single form-meaning unit, but which are
composed of multiple discontinuously-realized constituents; see §10.5) include an ellipsis
“…” between the constituents, as dó-…tɨ ́ɨ- ‘eat…imbibe’ ‘sustain oneself’. Free
translations of lexemes, phrases and sentences are presented in ‘plain text’; functional
morphemes and grammatical constituent functions are glossed in SMALL CAPS.
781.6.5. Sourcing of data
The majority of data presented in this work are marked for source, via a code
presented (in parentheses) following the translation line of examples (cf. (6)). Three main
types of sourced data are presented: recorded text, participant observation, and elicited.
Recorded text data sourcing is of the form (XX, YY ###), where XX gives the
initials of the speaker, YY gives a text code, and ### gives a line number. For example,
(TR, FA 006) indicates that the example was spoken by tomóo rɨbáa, in the text “Forest
animals” line 006. Text and speaker codes are defined in Appendix D.
Participant observation data sourcing is of the form (XX, OL#:##), where XX
gives the speaker’s initials and OL indicates “Observation log”. In the numeral sequence,
the first number gives the log number, and the second gives the page number. Unmarked
log numerals indicate a log from my first field trip in 2004-2005, log numerals bearing a
prefix B indicate a log from my second trip in 2006, and C indicates a log from 2007. For
example, (MN, OLB2:34) indicates the speaker miilɨ ̀ɨ ɲodù, sourced from the second
observation log of my 2006 trip, page 34.
Elicited data sourcing usually follows the same format as participant observation
data, except “OL” is omitted. A small number of elicited examples are of the form (XX,
EM ##-##-##); these refer to email elicitations, with numerals referring to the date of
elicitation. Email elicitations were conducted with only two consultants, ɨlɨ ̀ɨ rɨbáa andbomcàk rɨbáa. Both of these consultants participated in development of the Galo script
developed in the context of this project, are currently engaged in the production of or retranscription of literature using Galo script, and in short are both experts in phoneticallyaccurate transcription of Galo speech. That said, email elicitation is hardly ideal as a data
source, and examples so obtained are kept to a minimum.
Where no code is presented (as in (7)), this means that the example was
constructed by me for the purpose of illustrating a particular linguistic point; while all
such sentences have been checked by native speakers (usually by reading the example in
a draft of this grammar), they also lack the context which is usually built up even in the
course of elicitation; they may accordingly be viewed as grammatically correct sentences,
but also in most cases somewhat artificial.","[78, 79]"

‘talk’
(18)zabrɨ ́k hidùzáp-rɨ ́k-hí-dùu
talk-APPL:MEET-REFL-IPFV
‘talking to one another’
In (17), Imperfective -dùu is suffixed to a bound verb root záp- ‘talk’. Neither zápnor -dùu can stand independently, nor can they stand in any other relative order. A single,
uninterruptible prosodic contour occurs over zabdù, with potential pauses at either edge,
with a single tone contour and constituting a single metrical foot. On the segmental level,
internal sandhi and boundary phenomena are observed (i.e. Regressive voicing
assimilation (§4.1.3.7) occurs at the word-internal syllable boundary and Final length
neutralization (§4.1.4.4) occurs at the right-edge word boundary). Native speakers readily
152attribute meaning to zabdù but are unable to easily describe the meaning or function of
either of its parts. In short, a diverse set of criteria converge to support the notion thatzabdù is a “word”.
Now, however, consider (18). Here again, grammatical criteria identify a single
word. No subset of the string can occur independently or in any other order, and although
native speakers can attribute meaning to the whole, they cannot easily assign meaning to
its parts. However, two distinct prosodic units can now be identified, in which two
primary stress slots are found. Assimilation sandhi occur at the border of záp- and -rɨ ́k but
not at the border of -rɨ ́k and -hí (word-internally, h surfaces [s] post-consonantally; cf.
§3.2.4). In short, phonological criteria suggest that this is not one but rather two words.
Following the generally-accepted framework summarized in Dixon and
Aikhenvald (2002), as set forth in numerous previous works by them and other scholars,
this disconnect will be described here in terms of a difference between two types of unit:
“grammatical word” and “phonological word”. 71 The following subsections review
criteria by which these units may be identified. Some of these criteria involve
exceptionless (or rarely violable) rules, while others consist of more probabilistic
tendencies. In some cases, the convergence among or contrast between grammatical and
phonological words is robust, as in (17)-(18) above. In other cases, the analysis hinges on
thin and contextually variable criteria. The resulting picture is complex, perhaps in some
ways unsatisfyingly so. However, it must be recalled that Galo has heretofore been an
instrument for oral, face-to-face communication, and has not been significantly shaped by
conventionalization for writing purposes. Many of the difficulties found (by linguists and
native speakers alike) in consistently segmenting utterances into “words” for the purpose
of writing the language (as we are doing here) are, when speaking, simply a non-issue. 72
71This sense of “grammatical word” is not to be confused with another, unrelated sense in which
“grammatical word” denotes words which have as their value a grammatical function as opposed to a
lexical meaning, i.e. (in English) words like “the”, “to”, and “and” as opposed to “boat” and “tree”. To
avoid confusion, in the present work we use the term “grammatical word” in the Dixon-Aikhenvald sense of
opposition to “phonological word” and the term “function word” to refer to words with grammaticalfunctional as opposed to lexical status.
72
It is also instructive to consider that the word for ‘word’ in Galo agóm (< PTs *gom ‘speech; voice’) also
has the related senses ‘speech’, ‘language’, ‘utterance’, and ‘matter/point’. Thus, it might be more accurate
to gloss agóm as something like ‘communicum’ in the sense of ‘unit and/or medium of communication’,
without regard to segmentation or length. According to this definition (and according to Galo speakers’
usual judgments), both phonological and grammatical words may qualify as agóm (even when these do not
coincide), but neither roots nor affixes do. One might note here a potential similarity with Tibetan (among
other languages), in which multiword utterances, rather than words per se, are separated by spaces when
writing (Sprigg 1955). Importantly, such types contrast with the traditional Chinese concept of the basic
unit of language, the zǐ, which has a lower-level denotation including roots and morphemes, but no unit1534.1.1. Grammatical word
As defined by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:§7), a grammatical word is
identifiable as a grammatical unit between morpheme and syntactic phrase, whose
constitutents are a head plus immediate (local) dependents, in a fixed, continuous order in
terms of a given semantic value. These identification criteria are probably universal, and
are expanded on only briefly here with reference to examples (17) and (18) above.
a) indivisibility. Independent words cannot generally interrupt the strings of
morphemes expressed in (17) and (18). 73
b) patterning as a unit. The strings in (17) and (18) can be moved and modified
within the syntax as wholes, but no subset can.
c) fixed order. The orders of elements in (17) and (18) are fixed. While certain
sequences of grammatically bound forms (for example, predicate derivations (§11)) are to
an extent variably-ordered in Galo, variation always results in a different meaning; i.e., a
different grammatical word.
d) status as a syntactic unit. The strings in (17) and (18), taken as wholes, each
realize a predicate (a unit referred to by various syntactic rules, which is a constituent of
various phrase types, etc). No subset of either string in (17) and (18) can qualify as such a
syntactic unit.
e) grammatical part-whole composition. The functional and structural descriptions
of the parts in (17) and (18) refer to the whole, and the functional and structural
description of the whole makes reference to the parts. No elemental subset of (17) or (18)
relates to another constituent at the same or a higher level.
f) native speaker awareness of meaning and independent status. Speaking very
generally, a speaker is more likely to feel comfortable uttering and assigning meaning to a
grammatical word in isolation than to one of its subparts. For example, most speakers
sense no difficulty in uttering and assigning meaning to zabdù in (17) out-of-context,
although the same cannot be said of hidù in (18). There are difficulties in applying this
criterion, since native speakers typically experience greater difficulties in assigning
meaning to function words than to lexemes (i.e., go in would go is more easily defined or
larger than a word (Chao 1968). Some modern, linguistically-inclined Galo have coined the term gomcɨ ̀r
(lit., ‘speech pellet’) to denote sub-lexical roots and morphemes; it remains to be seen whether this usage
will become widely-accepted or not.

"Topical source constructionAn ablative noun phrase marked in əə is understood as a semantic Source. This
type of marking is roughly equivalent to marking with a Locative ablative demonstrative
(such as tolokə̀ ‘from that place up there’; see §7.4.5), and both markers may occur
435Htogether, “bracketing” the same NP, or apposed in the same function, as in (912). This is a
436Hfrequent yet puzzling construction, and it is not entirely clear whether such forms should
be treated as compositional (particularly in terms of the functions given) or not.
Additional research in this area is required. For further discussion of ablative marking and

14.2.2.2. Prototypically predicate-collocated nominals
As in many Tibeto-Burman languages, as well as elsewhere, it is common in Galo
to find nominals unmarked for case (and typically free of any other modifiers) occurring
immediately adjacent to a predicate and often forming a tight, word-like phonological
and conceptual bond with it. The grammatical status of such forms is not always
straightforwardly determined.
In some cases, it seems clear that the nominal in question is an argument of the
predicate – often, an O argument – which is not case-marked because it is generic and/or
non-referential (§14.2.1.1). In (913), rák- is a transitive verb meaning roughly ‘weave or
438H439Hplait using very large strips’, and can take a variety of O argument types, such as, in this
case, a ‘mithun pen’.

In other cases, it may be rare or even borderline ungrammatical to utter aparticular predicate type in absence of a particular type of collocated nominal. In (914),
430Hthe S complement clause predicate head kú- denotes a type of fishing traditionally
favoured by Galo women, in which a conical basket trap (raazùu) is placed between the
fisher’s legs, with the mouth facing a large stone. When the stone is lifted, shellfish
hiding under the stone are frightened into the basket, which is then raised and drained.
Only shellfish are caught using this method. In this sense, we can say that tahúm
‘shellfish’ denotes a type of entity prototypically associated with the event or state
denoted by the predicate.

[rɨ ̀-dó(o)]PRED=ree
shellfish
fish.using.basket.trap-IPFV=SBRD do-STAT=PQ
‘Can (that river) be fished for crawdads?’ (RmR, CC 102)
Prototypically predicate-collocated nominals run a fine line between syntacticargument and compound-element-like or incorporated status (Mithun 1984). For example,
predicates in kú- almost always occur with an adjacent, bare noun tahúm ‘shellfish’ as in
(914); although I have found it possible in elicitation to mark the noun tahúm in the
431Haccusative in sentences like (914), thus establishing kú- as – potentially, at least – a
432Htransitive verb root capable of taking tahúm as its O argument head, my consultants
assured me they would never actually speak this way. In natural speech, kú- would almost
never be uttered in absence of collocated tahúm, and tahúm would almost never be case
marked.
In other cases, we find prototypically predicate-collocated nominals occurring
with predicate types which are very clear in being able to take a wide variety of S/A or O
arguments; in this case, however, collocated arguments may occur as a means of limiting
715the denotational range and/or fixing a particular sense of the predicate head. For example,
no visitor to the Galo area will fail to hear the sentence in (915) before long.
43H(915) nó acín dobbé?[nó]A [acín]O
[dó-bée]PRED
2.SG cooked.rice eat-EPF
‘Have you eaten/had your meal yet?’
The occurrence of non-case-marked acín ‘cooked rice’ in (915) limits the
43Hdenotational range of dó- ‘eat’ to one of its potential senses ‘having a meal’, inasmuch as
‘cooked rice’ is the prototypical entity associated with the event type ‘eat a meal’ in Galo
culture. As such, it is possible to correctly answer әәm, dó-bée ‘yes eat-EPF’ ‘yes, I have’
to (915) even if one has on some rare occasion in fact eaten roti bread rather than rice – if
435Hthe roti constituted one’s meal rather than a snack – and one might just as easily ask the
question in (915) as a means of making polite conversation even if one were perfectly
436Haware that one’s addressee did not eat rice for his meal, etc.
Thus, one might suppose that acín-donám ‘cooked.rice-eat.NZR:RLS’ represents a
lexicalized, compound-like association between noun and verb, rather than a clause-level
argument-predicate relation per se, and this is certainly true to an extent. But it is always
possible to case-mark a prototypically-associated nominal if the sense intended is
somehow contrastive. So, for example nó acín=əəm dó-bée? ‘2.SG cooked.rice=ACC eatEPF’ ‘have you eaten the rice ~ have you ever eaten rice’ might be asked if a speaker wasgenuinely wondering if his addressee (presumably a non-Galo) had ever eaten rice before
in his life (assuming there to be any number of other unspecified things which he has
eaten), and/or was aware that the addressee had been served a variety of foodstuffs (as at
a banquet) and was wondering if he had eaten the rice yet (as distinct from whatever else
was known to be available).
Uses of prototypically predicate-collocated nominals abound in Galo discourse.
Although they most commonly reflect an underlying O argument of the predicate, many
other types of relation are also attested. For example, in isì-hú-nam ‘water-wash.bodyNZR:RLS’ ‘to bathe’, isì ‘water’ is an underlying instrument of the verb, as shown in ŋóisì=әə alə̀=əəm hú-rә́ ‘1.SG water=TOP foot/leg=ACC wash.body-IRR’ ‘I’m going to
wash my feet with water (as opposed to a chemical solution, etc.)’. In (916) below, the
437H716sense of láa- ‘take’ is ‘marry’, a transitive sense in which A is ‘(male) marrier’ and O is
‘(female) married (in the sense of having been taken into the family)’. Nominals
prototypically-associated with the ‘marry’ sense of ‘take’ such as ɲimә́ ‘wife’ can be
marked in the accusative if, for example, contrastive with ɲamә́ә ‘daughter-in-law’ (as
when clarifying that one is speaking from the groom’s perspective rather than from the
perspective of an elder male of the groom’s family). In (916), however, note that the O
438Hargument is realized in the syntax as kohùk=əəm ‘dried.oko.leaf=ACC’; and yet, the
prototypical object ɲimә́ ‘wife’ is retained as an un-case-marked, prototypicallyassociated nominal. If ɲimә́ ‘wife’ were case-marked under these conditions, it would
have to be marked in the dative. However, rather than considering ɲimә́ in (916) to occur
439Has a (zero-marked) E or oblique noun phrase, it may be preferable to consider it as weakly
incorporated into and/or compounded to the predicate, in the sense of functioning simply
to restrict or disambiguate the sense of ‘take’ intended (without which, it would be
understood that the A argument referent ‘took’, i.e. picked up, a dried-up oko leaf). The
concept of weak “incorporation” is also discussed in §5.3.2.1.

predicate-collocated nominals; in (917), the predicate-collocated nominal lampó

overlap (for example, a referent which is near to the speaker may also be important, and vice versa), and it
is not always possible to differentiate in a particular use between these ostensibly different types of function.","[356, 357]"
"69114.1.3.7. Non-occurrence of passive
By “passive”, I understand a marked morphosyntactic operation of
detransitivization, in which the object is “raised” to subject position, and in which the
notional subject (underlying A) is expressed, or is expressible, as an oblique (Dixon 1994:
146). The presence of a passive construction in a language is often taken as strong
evidence for grammaticalization of and/or functional use of the grammatical relations of
“subject” and “object”. In Galo, however, despite relatively robust evidence for subject as
outlined in above sections, there is no marked syntactic construction in which a notional
subject is expressed or expressible as a main-clause-level oblique noun phrase, hence no
morphosyntactic “passive” as such. There are derivational operations which appear to
operate at the word level on the argument structure of predicates and the semantic roles
which are assigned to them, enabling semantic interpretations which render them
functionally similar to passives, 267 but none with the precise syntactic consequences
26Foutlined above. 268
267F14.1.3.8. O and E arguments and the grammatical relation(s) of “object”
Above subsections reviewed evidence for the grammatical relation “subject” in
terms of intransitive and transitive clause types, using “object” as an informal label for the
syntactic realization of O. Turning to clause types with extended core argument structures,
however, the evidence for “object” becomes somewhat less categorical.
In an extended transitive clause headed by a predicate in zí- ‘give’ – or else
derived by the related Benefactive applicative -zí – both O and E arguments are typically
marked in the accusative (865).
4235HCf. especially the ‘Reversive’ suffix -kò (§11.2.5.8), which has the effect of causing the argument roles
of A and O to be reversed (schematically, I hit-ko him, in which ‘him’ is understood as Agent and ‘I’ as
Patient). However, predicate marking in -kò seems to have no syntactic consequences at all, hence is not a
“passivizing” morpheme.
268
I do not take the absence of a passive in Galo to argue against the relevance of passive constructions to
the description of grammatical relations in general. Rather, I would say that simply having the grammatical
relation “subject” does not in itself predict the presence of a passive. Inasmuch as a language may have one
or more other means of expressing a transitive non-actor in subject position, as is the case in Galo, there
may simply be no functional pressure to grammaticalize a true passive construction.

relativization at all, but rather represents a variety of incorporation of the O argument noun phrase into the

generally take specialized terminology, as oén ‘tall/high, of a constructed thing’ and oɨ ̀ɨ
‘short/low, of a constructed thing’.
SHAPE and DIMENSION may be simultaneously encoded via an Adjectival classifier
expression (§8.2.2.4), in which the SHAPE of an entity is encoded by a classifier root and
218Hthe DIMENSION by an adjectival root, as pɨ ́-tə̀ ‘CLF:EGG-big’ ‘big, of a spherical/egg-like
thing’. Such formations have the syntactic status of adjectivals, and are generally
preferred by my consultants to shape-unspecific terminology such as kaí ‘big’. Certain
domain-specific DIMENSION terms which occur as basic adjectives appear likely to have
been formed according to the same basic SHAPE-DIMENSION pattern, although the initial
formative is a noun root rather than a classifier root, and the formation is non-productive.
For example, boksòo and bogjàr both mean ‘long, of a river-diverting dam’; in both
words, the initial formative bok- (tone unknown) is cognate with the final formative ofhibòk ‘river diversion dam’, and their final formatives reflect hòo- ‘long/tall’ and jàr‘length(wise); long’ respectively. It is probable that both classifier expressions such as pɨ ́-tə̀ and compound adjectives such as boksòo have resulted from an earlier N-ADJ or N-V
syntactic construction, but went on to develop somewhat differently in terms of the
modern Galo lexicon.
5.2.3.4. Age
Age of inanimate entities is straightforwardly expressed by the basic adjectivesakò ‘old.INAN’ and alìi ‘new’, as well as by cognate inner core adjectives (§5.2.3.2).
2189HHuman age is more complex. There are no general terms meaning ‘old.ANIM’ and ‘young’;
instead, such concepts are denoted by gender and relative-age-specific terms – also used
as nouns – as ɲikám ‘old (woman)’ (< ɲí- ‘person’ + kám- ‘mature; hardened’) andjaamée ‘boy; young, of a male’ (< jáa- ‘small; cute’ + mée- ‘young.MASC’). The basic
class-status of such terms is often difficult to determine (cf. also §5.2.2.8).
2190HAge of non-human animates, such as dogs or goats, has proved a perplexing topic.
Many of my younger consultants were unable to identify a clear set of terms to denote
animal age, and insisted that they would only use terms such as dór-tə̀ ‘CLF:HIGH.ANIMALbig’ ‘big, of an animal’. Some more expert and/or experienced speakers were able to
243identify several lexemes corresponding to species-specific stages in development, as nəzɨ ̀r
‘female calf’ (< nə̀- ‘female; mother; cow’ + zɨ ̀r- ‘girl’), although very few of these were
found to be used as adjectives. Other speakers were found to apply human age-related
terms to animals; for example, in §12.3.2.2, ex. (621) ɲikám-horám ‘old, wizened
219H219Hwoman’ and ɲizɨ ́ɨ-hokám ‘old, wizened man’ are found to describe mature female and
male leeches (that these are originally terms denoting humans/human age is confirmed by
the appearance of the root ɲí- ‘person’ in both cases).
I am unable to explain this seeming anomaly in the Galo lexicon except to suggest
that it may have historically been more common to simply refer to animals in terms of
their species-specific stages of development. With the breakdown in this as many other
complex areas of the Galo lexicon, as well as contact with Indo-European languages in
which general concepts denoting age of animates are lexicalized, we may now be
witnessing a period of shift. More research in this area should be conducted.
5.2.3.5. Value
There are very few terms denoting VALUE-related concepts in Galo. alə́ ‘good’ is a
very frequent term, usually subject to Syncope (§4.1.4.5) as alə́-dùu ‘good-IPFV’, usually
2193Hrealized [`aldù]; it is found in the typical Galo formal greeting alə́-dùu ree ‘good-IPFV PQ’
‘are you well?’, as well as the typical Galo expression of thanks alə́-dó(o) ‘good-STAT’
‘thank you’ (lit., ‘it’s good’). alə́ ‘good’ is subject to emphatic realization as allɨ ̂ɨ ‘well;
excellent (ADJ)’, as well as adverbial modification by derived basic adjective maazí=bə́
‘very.much=AVZR’. Items of high inherent value – especially, items which are viewed as
delicate – are described via dincì ‘care; precious’ (etymology/composition unknown).
Concepts denoting negative value are generally not lexicalized; the normal way of saying
‘bad’ is alə́-máa ‘good-NEG’. Distasteful items or those which cause a disagreeable
experience (but which are neutral in terms of inherent value) are described using the
adjectivalizing Manner predicate derivation -nèk ‘BAD’ (§11.2.1).
2194H5.2.3.6. Colour244Most COLOUR terms employ the prefix ja- ‘FDIM’ (§5.3.1.1.3). They structurally
2195Hresemble nouns, and may also be used as nouns. The only real motivation for viewing
COLOUR terms as basic adjectives is that while use as an adjective denotes the colourconcept itself, a nominal use usually denotes an entity of that type, as jakàa-dùu ‘blackIPFV’ ‘(it’s) black’ but jakàa=go ‘black=IND’ ‘(a) black one’; to denote the abstractconcept for nominal use, a COLOUR term must be nominalized, as jakàa-nam ‘blackNZR:RLS’ ‘blackness; being black; (the concept of) black’.","[242, 243, 244, 245]"

"581.2.10.2. Notable linguistic features
1.2.10.2.1. Disconnect between “grammatical” and “phonological” words
In Galo, it is not always possible to clearly or consistently correlate grammatical
and phonological criteria for “word”-hood. That is, although we can independently
develop clear and consistent grammatical and phonological criteria for recognizing a unit
“word”, these may, or may not, converge on identification of the same unit. Generally
speaking, grammatical word-hood is defined in terms of a composition of grammatical
head plus any immediate morphological (grammatical) dependents. Phonological wordhood is in turn defined in terms of a variety of phenomena, including prosodic
specifications (single metrical foot with single stress, single surface TBU with single
tonal value and contour…) segmental specifications (boundary effects, internal
assimilation sandhi, external phonotactics…) and so on. Following these definitions,
grammatical and phonological words may line up; for example, takèk ‘body dirt’ is “a
word” according to both grammatical and phonological criteria. Or, one grammatical
word may contain two (or more) phonological words: záp-làk-dùu-kú ‘talk-CAP-IPFVCMPL’ ‘starting to be able to talk’ is realized zablâk duukù (note the operation ofregressive voicing assimilation across the first, phonological-word-internal, suffix
boundary, but not the second, cross-phonological-word, suffix boundary). On the other
hand, one phonological word may contain two grammatical words. Two monosyllabic
postpositions, or a postposition plus a particle, which occur in immediate sequence and
which constitute a well-formed metrical foot may be realized as a single phonological
word, as bə́=cìn ‘DAT=ADD’, which may be realized bəcìn. For further discussion, see
§4.1.
1.2.10.2.2. “Double case” and “functor fusion”
As was mentioned in §1.2.10.1.6, it is common to find usually disyllabic
sequences in Galo which either reflect a sequence of case markers/postpositions which is
compositional/productive in modern Galo, or which (probably more often) reflects an
earlier compositionality which has since fused into an indivisible unit. An example of a
modern compositional case sequence is əəm=nè ‘ACC=NAGT’, a sequence which marks
both O argument NPs and Irrealis temporal phrases (i.e., ‘at lunchtime tomorrow’).
Compositionality is certain in this case since the Non-agentive marker is not obligatory,
59but adds a basically intensifying value to the expression. An example of a modern
disyllabic postposition which cannot be analysed as compositional in modern Galo (but
which almost certainly was compositional at an earlier stage) is lokə̀ ‘ABL; PART’.
Deriving almost certainly from the sequence *lo ‘LOC’ + *kə̀ ‘GEN’, *kə̀ no longer occurs
as a phrase-level genitive enclitic in Galo, having seemingly lenited to form the current
Genitive enclitic gə. An earlier Genitive *kə̀ is reflected in the Galo pronominal Genitive
suffix -kə̀ ‘GEN’, as in ŋó-kə̀ ‘1.SG-GEN’ ‘my’, as well as in the general Pagro Mising
(pronominal and noun phrasal) Genitive (k)kə.
However, it is also possible to find cases which are difficult to clearly identify as
compositional or fused. An example is lobə ‘LMT.RANGE’ which has the basic Dumessive
sense ‘until (a give point within a range)’, as in luuɲɨ ̀ɨ lobə ‘next.year LMT.RANGE’ ‘until
next year’. Clearly deriving from the simplex postpositions lo ‘LOC’ and bə́ ‘DAT’, and
deriving its semantic value directly from the semantic values of its formatives (lo ‘LOC’
can mark future/irrealis time nouns, and bə́ ‘DAT’ often marks Extensive noun phrases as
a limit in quantity, scope or range), there would appear to be a good argument for
continuing compositionality. Furthermore, the Dative postposition could be removed,
leaving luuɲɨ ̀ɨ=lo ‘next.year=LOC’ ‘(in) next year’, which would seemingly clinch the
argument. However, it is also possible to mark luuɲɨ ̀ɨ ‘next year’ in the Non-agentive nè
(in an irrealis punctual temporal marking sense). In this case, it is no longer possible to
subsequently mark the expression in lo ‘LOC’ *luuɲɨ ̀ɨ=nè=lo
‘next.year=IRR.TMP.PUNC=LOC’. However, it is possible to use the range-limiting
postposition: luuɲɨ ̀ɨ=nè=lobə ‘next.year=IRR.TMP.PUNC=LMT.RANGE’ ‘until exactly next
year’. Thus, it would seem that in at least some if not all functions, lobə ‘LMT.RANGE’
must be analysed as a fused unit; this and all similar phenomena must be approached and
tested on a case-by-case basis.lobə ‘LMT.RANGE’ illustrates a case of earlier postposition + postposition
composition. Additional examples of seeming “functor fusion” with different
compositional values include gobə ‘LMT.UNIT’ (< go ‘IND’ + bə́ ‘DAT’, article +
postposition), bolò ‘DST.LOC.DOWN’ (< bə̀ ‘DST.DOWN’ + lo ‘LOC’, demonstrative +
60postposition), bəree ‘CJEC’ (< bə́ ‘DAT’ + ree ‘PQ’, postposition + particle) and -gərə́
‘ACNC’ (< -gə́ ‘COMT’ (?) + -rə́ ‘IRR’ (predicate derivation + predicate inflection). Many
more such examples will be adduced in passing throughout this work.
1.2.10.2.3. Classification
Galo exploits the semantics of classification in an unusually wide range of
grammatical domains. In addition to a large system of numeral classifiers, which combine
with both numerals and certain types of adjective to form enumerative and adjectival
classifier expressions – Galo makes extensive use of a classificatory “generic-specific”
template in word- and phrase-formation. For example, in lɨɨpùm ‘stone pile fish trap’, the
initial formative root lɨ ̀ɨ- ‘stone’ denotes a class of entity – things to do with stones – andpùm- ‘pile’ narrows the denotation to a specific class member. Often, the second
formative may be repeated in a “root-pivotal” construction to form the classificatory head
of a second term, as lɨ ̀ɨ-pùm=pùm-ɲì ‘stone-pile=pile-two’ ‘two stone piles’. The
classificatory principle applies at two levels in such constructions. On the root level, lɨ ̀ɨ‘stone’ and pùm- ‘pile’ each stand as generic initial formatives within the grammatical
words lɨɨpùm ‘stone pile’ and pumɲì ‘two piles’, while pùm- ‘pile’ and ɲì- ‘two’ stand as
specific final formatives. On the word level, lɨɨpùm ‘stone pile fish trap’ stands as a
generic formative, denoting the concept of a type of entity in the world, while pumɲì ‘two
piles’ stands as a specific formative, fixing the overall reference in terms of a set of
individuals. In many such types of word- and phrase-formation in Galo, the semantic
concept of “classification” describes the underlying structure of linear arrangements more
insightfully than would a more generalized, semantically-vague concept of
“modification”
1.2.10.2.4. Use of noun phrase relational/case markers in clause-subordination
As in many other Tibeto-Burman languages, Galo makes use of noun phrase
relational/case markers in clause-subordination. In certain types of clause-subordination,
such as framing nominalizations (=tail-head linkages), the clause is quite clearly
nominalized, and bears a noun phrase Topic marker in conjunction with its occurrence in
61a pre-clausal “topic slot” in the syntax; such cases are perhaps unremarkable. In other
types of clause-subordination, such as temporal/episodic subordination (when John
arrived…), the clause is fully finite/inflected (in non-perfective aspects only), but is
marked by a subordinating posposition such as lo ‘LOC’, and occurs in the syntactic
position normally reserved for temporal or locative noun phrases. In most subtypes of
temporal/episodic subordination, the subject is obligatorily in the Genitive; however, the
predicate is not nominalized at the word-level, and there are no other indications of a
nominalization-like clause structure. In most cases of temporal/episodic clausesubordination, the semantic value of the subordinating postposition is identical, or at least
quite close, to its semantic value in oblique noun phrase-marking. The oblique noun
phrase-marking/clause-subordinating syncretism even extends to seemingly idiosyncratic
conventions which might not have been expected to necessarily occur in all available
environments. For example, as was also mentioned in §1.2.10.2.2, the “double case”
sequence əəm=nè ‘ACC=NAGT” marks an O argument under a more or less intensive
(highly affected as a participant, or well-individuated as a referent) construal. In temporal
noun phrase marking, the same sequence əəm=nè ‘ACC=NAGT’ marks an Irrealis time
nominal as highly precise in reference, as “in exactly next year (at no other time)”. Again,
the same sequence marks an Irrealis/Hypothetical clause-subordination, as nócàa-rə́=əəm=nè ‘2.SG ascend-IRR=ACC=NAGT’ ‘right when/if you go up…’. In all three
cases, use of the Non-agentive marker is optional, and serves to intensify the reference.
1.2.10.2.5. Predicate derivations
Galo has an extremely large and productive set (more than 320 members) of
predicate derivations, or bound predicate stem-expanding formatives. Possibly deriving
diachronically from proto-verb-serialization at the VP or sentence level, the modern
system of Galo predicate derivations is entirely predicate word-internal. Applying with
leftward scope over a predicate stem in an only partially-variable order (due to semantic
scope restrictions), predicate derivations perform a wide array of modifying functions,
listed in §1.2.10.1.4 above. The wide availability of predicate derivations has a profound
effect on the organization of Galo grammar. Many functions coded by auxiliary verbs or
serial verbs in other languages (such as modality, including concepts such as
want/need/must, or try to) are handled by predicate derivations in Galo. In addition, many
complex event-construals which are lexicalized as single words in other languages, such
62as kill (to cause someone to die) are handled compositionally in Galo, as mò-kə̀ ‘makeDEAD’ (reflecting the composition VROOT-PDER). Also many abstract concepts such astime or manner are not lexicalized in Galo, but instead are handled by nominalizing
predicate derivations, as mèn-kór ‘speak-NZR:MANNER’ ‘way of talking’. Accordingly, it
is not possible in Galo to form periphrastic expressions such as ‘their ways of talking’, in
which ‘way’ and ‘talk’ can be independently modified; rather, the composition is entirely
word-internal.
1.2.11. Number of speakers and degree of endangerment
By comparison with many languages, both in North-East India and elsewhere in
the world, Galo’s degree of endangerment is not high. Access to the Galo area, and
indeed most areas of Arunachal Pradesh, remains tightly restricted by the Government of
India; and since the Galo remain overwhelmingly dominant in their area, their language is
spoken daily and learned as a first language by a majority of children (though certainly
not by all). No reliable survey on the number of Galo speakers (as opposed to Galo
tribespeople, who do not always speak Galo) has to date been conducted. The 1981
Census of India put the number of “Adi Gallong” tribespeople at 8,999 (Hussain 1995).
However, the 1991 census puts the figure at a bursting 45,616! This increase is clearly not
solely due to population growth, but rather reflects the extreme difficulties of demarcating
tribal and linguistic categories in North-East India, and the absence of any effective or
commonly agreed-upon means for doing so. Depending on where lines are drawn, based
on the current population of the “scheduled tribes” of West Siang district, 84,922 (West
Siang District Economics and Statistics Deptartment 2004) – the number of Galo speakers
may be estimated at around 30,000-40,000 (or more, depending on where lines are drawn)
with at least half of them being speakers of some form of Lare. These are relatively
healthy-looking numbers when one considers that historically, the number of Galo
speakers must have been much lower.
However, changes in this comfortable status quo are already apparent. With
improvements in communication, economic opportunities, and the reach of regional,
national and even international media into Arunachal Pradesh, Galo are increasingly
relying on more widely spoken Indo-European languages – usually Hindi and Assamese,
but also English – when leaving their immediate home surroundings. Families who can
afford to invariably send their children away to boarding schools at an early age, since
good quality government schools are not found in most Arunachali localities. These often
63religiously-oriented boarding schools often actively discourage use of a child’s native
language (sometimes punishing those who speak their native language with their peers),
with the result that children attending such boarding schools end up spending the bulk of
their childhood speaking Hindi; naturally, such children will tend to control this language
better than their “native” language by the time they are young adults. Complex
technological or novel objects are invariably named in English or Hindi rather than in
Galo. In certain Assamese contact areas in the foothills, loanword use is often extreme, to
the point where native grammar has come to largely provide a partial shell for an almost
wholly borrowed lexicon.
While this is not an unusual phenomenon among the tribal languages of India (and
elsewhere), it is also perhaps not desirable from the point of view of the preservation of
North-East Indian cultural heritage, and the preservation and vibrancy of Galo culture in
particular. The structures of Galo and Indo-European grammars are vastly different, and
are in many important ways incompatible; often, to adopt a borrowed structure is not to
alternate with the native structure, but rather to replace it.
To take a simple example, it is practically impossible to integrate borrowed verb
roots into the Galo system of morphological verb stem expansions (i.e. predicate
derivations), due to differences in the semantic and functional ranges handled lexically
and derivationally in Galo and in Indo-European languages. English check (VT.) – a
frequently borrowed word – lexically incorporates the ‘Tentative’ aspect for which an
independent native form -káa ‘TENT’ exists in Galo (thus, English check is most closely
translated by the bi-morphemic Galo expression káa-káa- ‘look-TENT’ (§11.2.3.1)). With
aspect already lexically encoded by the loanword, native stem-expanding aspect markers
not only are not used, they cannot be used: *cék-káa- ‘check-TENT’ is unacceptable. In
this sense, use of a loaned verb does not simply substitute one word for another – a
relatively benign and common enough thing in any language – it actually precludes use of
an entire swathe of Galo grammar. To take a different sort of example, the relatively low
salience and variability of tones in Galo means that many young people with limited
exposure to their native language do not learn the tone system perfectly. Such speakers
have been observed to deliberately and consciously use loanwords to replace one or more
terms which are homophonous to them, but which in their parents’ speech are minimal
pairs on tone. The speech of some young Galo in high Indic contact areas may be
described as almost completely atonal and, in this as well as in other ways, partially
unintelligible unless loanwords are used.
64Historically, the Galo are now at a turning point. There is no shortage of expert
speakers in every Galo-dominated area, and given the relatively large number of Galo
people and tight integration of their communities, there is every hope that the Galo
language will continue to be spoken far into the future. However, making this hope a
reality will require attention and efforts which must begin to be made today. This
grammar, and the accompanying dictionary still in preparation, represent an initial step in
the development of materials which will aid in preservation and maintenance of the Galo
language. But to ensure the future of the language, we need writing conventions,
textbooks, literature, websites, audiovisual materials, and above all, a broad awareness
among young Galo of what is actually at stake – in the case of Galo, it is nothing less than
the survival and vibrancy of a unique and complex language and culture which dates back
hundreds if not thousands of years – and which could be substantially and irretrievably
altered, if not lost, at the mere drop of a historical hat.
1.3. Previous studies of the Galo and their language
As already noted, this is the first large-scale study of Galo grammar yet attempted.
In fact, very little serious linguistic or anthropological work of any scale has yet been
conducted in Arunachal Pradesh. A more complete review of the major works attempted
over the last 150 years on Tani languages more generally may be found in Sun
(1993:§1.4). Here we review only those works with direct reference to Galo.
An Introduction to the Gallong Language by Das Gupta (1963) appears to have
been written for the benefit of non-local Indian Government administrators who were
posted in the Galo area at that time. As a book explicitly written for “everyday use”, it has
proven to be of extremely limited value to linguists (to say nothing of the Galo people
themselves). This is due as much to the almost innumerable errors of transcription,
grammaticality, translation, and interpretation (often enough, all four) which are found in
nearly every sentence example presented as it is to the author’s consciously haphazard
admixture of at least three phonologically and grammatically divergent Galo dialects
throughout the work. In short, it is an almost completely unreliable work both from the
point of view of data and analysis, and has had no discernible impact on local
development of the Galo language. Nevertheless, it has a certain historical value as the
first ever published work (so far as I am aware) on Galo, and may for all I know have in
fact served the specific community and purpose for which it was designed well enough.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"
"612more “optional”, usually post-phrasal form, which provides supplementary (non-basic,
non-obligatory, and/or non-inflectional) pragmatic or epistemic information, and which
can often mark multiple constituent types and/or occur in more than one syntactic position
with the same basic function. This definition is almost certainly not watertight, neither in
the sense of clearly distinguishing particles from phrasal operators, nor in the sense of
enabling clearcut recognition of all and only the members of a well-motivated natural
class. Unfortunately, as with the “adverbs” and “prepositions” of English, the syntactic
and functional diversity of the Galo particle class is such that a well-motivated
subclassification would have to take an enormous range of synchronic and diachronic
facts into account – a project which both demands a much larger speech corpus than that
currently available and a work of more specialized approach. Thus, although an effort has
been made here to group and subclassify particles on well-motivated distributional and
functional grounds, both the category as a whole and its subclassification should be
viewed as highly provisional and subject to revision as more data become available.
13.1.2. Diachronic perspective
As of this writing, etymologies have not been identified for the vast majority of
Galo “particles”. This fact, taken together with their frequent distributional and functional
versatility, suggests that at least some particles may be very old indeed, with at least some
forms potentially reconstructible to ancestral languages. Unfortunately, on this topic we
can say almost nothing further, since virtually no mention of particles has been made in
any of the extant sources on Tani language grammars – leaving no basis for
reconstruction. 241 The reason for this omission seems clear: most particles only rarely
240Foccur when sentences are elicited in translation from Indo-European languages, whereas
they occur very frequently in the context of spontaneous, face-to-face conversation
(which has not generally formed part of the database of previous works on Tani
languages).
Within a narrower historical perspective, it appears that particles have in some
cases arisen secondarily as a result of fusion, whether of two particles or (more commonly)
of a particle with a particular enclitic or suffix. Such (usually disyllabic) sequences may
subsequently collapse under particular morphophonological conditions, giving rise to a
241The term “particle” in Abraham’s (1985) description of Apatani refers to the predicate-dependent forms
described in this work as “predicate derivations”. As for the constituent-peripheral forms described here as
“particles”, there is no treatment in Abraham’s grammar, with the exception of a brief mention of the
Apatani Reported information particle juke (also found in Galo) on the final page of that work.","[612, 613]"

terms of an earlier derivational alternation jáa ~ jàa, with the high tone alternant
potentially also relatable to the initial formative of adjective/noun jaakáa ‘many; a large
quantity’ (which would regularly carry an etymological high-tone; see §4.2.2.2).
394H13.2.2.8. Abessive lәә
Abessive lәә is a rarely-used particle marking a referent as a remembered entity
not present at the time of speaking. It is often used when speaking in an attitude of
reminiscence, or with a lonely, wistful sense (723)-(724).

Capitalizing on its discourse-pragmatic value as a marker of Proximal topics
(which, that is, may also be construed as spatially proximate, or else are unspecified for
spatial deixis (§7.4.1.2, ex. (218); cf. also (227))), Speaker-proximate simplex
269H270H2701Hdemonstrative hì has also developed the extended functionality of marking a spatially
non-proximal referent as a Proximal topic.
In the sequence in (228)-(229), which represents a continuous stretch of text from
270H2703Hthe same speaker, note in (228) that the noun phrase referent “our place” – marked by the
2704HIndividuative speaker-proximate demonstrative hɨgɨ ̀ – may be simultaneously understood
as spatially speaker-proximate and topically prominent. In (229) however, a new,
2705Hspatially non-speaker-proximal discourse topic is established. A salient contrast in spatial
location motivates the speaker to shift to a distal demonstrative, which, unlike proximate
demonstratives, has no capacity to mark a proximal topic. Therefore, the noun phrase is
simultaneously marked in hì – which is now no longer interpretable as a spatial-deictic
demonstrative.

Although dedicated use of this “Proximal topic-marking” function of hì on nonspatially-speaker-proximal noun phrases is very rare by comparison with use of the
358general Topic-marker əə, it would seem that they have basically the same purely
discourse-oriented functionality and overall categorical status within the noun phrase (i.e.,
they are both “articles” rather than demonstratives per se). Note that, unlike an ostensibly
“demonstrative” use of hì as in (227), hì in (229) cannot be “bracketed” around the noun
2706H270Hphrase – a key syntactic test for demonstrative status (§6.1.2.2.4). Note also that hì in
2708HProximal topic-marking function remains noun phrase-internal, as shown by its
continuing to host phrasal case-marking (230) – a key distinction from the post-phrasal
2709Hcategory of Particles (§13.1).

diachronic origin in Simplex distal demonstrative suffixation by Genitive pronominal
suffix -kə̀, as tə̀-kə̀ ‘DST.UP-GEN’. Like Genitive-marked pronouns but unlike most other
demonstratives, Semblative demonstratives take phrasal enclitics, but do not take (further)
pronominal case suffixes when occurring as the sole constituent of an argument noun
phrase; this would seemingly suggest an origin as a headless noun phrase as təkə̀=go
‘DST.SEMB.UP=IND’, possibly reflecting tə̀-kə̀ Ø go ‘DST.UP-GEN (NOM) IND’. Description
of Semblative/Genitive demonstratives as an independent paradigm basically hinges on
the seeming lexicalization of (unpredictable) progressive vowel harmony i → ə in the
359Speaker-proximate form, on some possible evidence of semantic/functional specialization
in Semblative functions, and on the inability to re-introduce a putatively ellipsed nominal
“head” in all functions.
Below and elsewhere in this grammar, Semblative/Genitive demonstratives are
glossed ‘SEMB’ when in Semblative functions and ‘GEN’ when in Genitive functions.
7.4.3.2. Basic functions
Genitive demonstratives stand as or mark a noun phrase-internal genitive phrase
for deixis, usually in possessive functions (231).

Semblative demonstratives stand as or mark a referring noun phrase as an
exemplar of a kind or sort, generally for use as a standard of comparison. Semblative
demonstratives thus, in a sense, are bi-referential, in that they simultaneously refer to one
entity (say, the “primary referent”) which is construed as the entity actually participating
in the event/state denoted by the clause predicate, as well as another entity (say, the
“secondary referent”) which is construed as the standard against which the primary
referent’s identity may be fixed. For example, in (232), the S argument noun phrase refers
2713Hto a chicken of a particular type which the predicate asserts to exist in a particular place.
The S argument reference is fixed, however, in terms of a different individual (exemplar
of the type) which is actually located spatially upwards of the deictic centre at the time of
speaking. Similarly, in (233), the speaker identifies a type of tree which he asserts to be
2714Hbeautiful in terms of an actual exemplar of that type which was located upwards of him
and his interlocutor at the time of speaking,360(232) təkgò rədù.[təkə̀=go]S

accessible. For example, in both (232) and (233), the speakers were referring to “exotic”
2715H2716Hspecies for which Galo names do not exist.
Proximate semblative demonstratives also have discourse-endophoric uses; in
(235), the Addressee-proximate Semblative demonstrative əkə̀ refers anaphorically to the

7.4.3.3.1. “Hesitation” use of həkə̀
Capitalizing on its potential for cataphoric discourse-functional use with the basic
sense ‘of the sort/type of this (following) thing’ (§7.4.1.2), həkə̀ has become one of the
270Hthree most frequent native Galo hesitation particles or words, akin to English sorta. Like
the dedicated, semantically empty hesitation particle/word məráa ‘HEST’ (§13.7.6), həkə̀
271Hin its hesitation use is able to stand as a pro-form for any type of lexical head. In (236),
27Hnote the use of həkə̀ as a “pro-predicate-head” – an impossibility for any other
demonstrative, Semblative or otherwise – as well as its alternation with məráa ‘HEST’ in
the same function. In (237), note that həkə̀ in hesitating use repeats the genitive phrase
273Hconstituent in a hesitating function, and that the genitive reflex is phrasal enclitic gə; this
would suggest that həkə̀ is here functioning as a syntactic common nominal rather than
pronoun.

It is
paradigmatically opposed in this function to Individuator go (see §14.2.1.2). əkə̀ in this
274Hfunction cannot occur pronominally, but instead must modify another noun phrase head.
In addition, it cannot precede the head; however, it can co-occur with another, different,
pre-head demonstrative. These facts together suggests that əkə̀ in “plural indefinite”
function has or is developing the basic status of a plural indefinite article (§6.1.2.2.7).

7.4.4. Individuative demonstratives
7.4.4.1. Structure
Individuative demonstratives are found in speaker-proximate and addresseeproximate forms hɨgɨ ̀ and əgə̀ only. Distal individuative demonstratives are not found in
Lare Galo. 161 Etymologically, Individuative demonstratives appear to derive from
160Fcombinations of simplex proximate demonstratives with Individuator go, followed by
lexicalization of Regressive vowel harmony (a very rare and irregular change in Galo
which has produced what may be the only extant short -ɨ rhyme in the language): *hi-go> *hi-gi > hɨ-gɨ ̀ and *ə-go > ə-gə̀.
The form of the Speaker-proximate Individuative demonstrative is subject to some
variation among speakers, with the form higù ~ hɨgù occasionally attested among older
speakers (cf. §7.3.3.2, ex. (194)). It is possible that this represents a more conservative

Galo has not been extensively researched as of this writing, and such expressions are not accepted by Lare
speakers. I can currently offer no hypothesis concerning the lack of such forms in Lare.","[357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"

2487Hboth of tatɨ ́k=go ‘a frog’ and ikìi=go ‘a dog’ stand as O argument of the clause.
Nominal conjunction laa seems almost certainly cognate to Non-final predicate suffix -là(a) ‘NF’; however, while the latter is grammatically a predicate suffix, that Nominal
conjunction laa is a clitic is clearly shown by its position after the NP-final article go in
(138).

2493Hthe two NPs jakàa=go ‘black=IND’ ‘black one’ and japúu=go ‘white=IND’ ‘white one’
are each marked by Conjectural particle bəree; both stand as Verbless clause complement.

In predicative clause argument positions, disjunctive NP-coordination is typicallymarked by disjunctive coordinator máa ‘DSJ’. máa ‘DSJ’ is homophonous with the Copula
negator/Negative interjection máa ‘NEG’, and probably derives from the latter historically.
However (as discussed in §16.3.1.2 also) it is important to note that the Negator as a

"429they, in general, occur as a noun phrase head in any other context in Galo. 199 The second
198Fis that Imperfective copula əə forms a paradigm with Perfective copula ee, in many if not
all of their respective functions. Thus, although it seems quite likely that the emergence of
an Imperfective copula from a verbless clause construction was recent, and has left many
distributional regularities of the source construction in its wake (some of which may
translate to distributional irregularities in the modern constructions, such as the differing
positions of negation; see §9.3.3), evidence for the development as such would appear to
30Hbe sufficient.
9.4. Cleft/focus constructions
A cleft/focus construction is a formally and functionally marked construction
which exhibits structural featues of both predicative and appositive clause types. In a
prototypical cleft/focus construction, a single, pragmatically important constituent of an
appositive or predicative clause is marked as “focused” by one of a wide variety of
clause-final particles and often (but not obligatorily) “set off” from the remainder of the
clause via left-dislocation. In terms of this construction, the focused constituent will be
referred to as the “marked focus” and the particle which marks the focus as the “focus
particle”. The remaining constituent will be referred-to as the “topic”; schematically: [[x
PCL]FOC [y]TOP] ‘[[it is x]FOC [that y]TOP]’.","[429, 430]"
"Interjections
Interjections are words or other fixed constructions which constitute a complete,self-contained utterance. They may be apposed to clauses, but do not themselves
constitute syntactic clause constituents. The typical function of an interjection is to
673express speaker attitude, often in a general, non-information-specific sense. As in most
languages, there is a large number of interjections in Galo and interjection use almost
certainly varies considerably from subdialect to subdialect and indeed individual to
individual. The following will serve as a partial account only.
13.7.1. Calls and responses to humans
In addition to terms of address (kinship terms, titles and proper names) and
vocatives (§13.6.2), which occur as enclitics to a term of address, the following Galo

"Grammatical functions and grammatical relations
“Grammatical functions” may be understood quite generally to indicate thegrammatical role played by a particular noun phrase with respect to the argument
structure of the clause in which it occurs: namely, whether the noun phrase stands as a
core argument of that clause, or not, and if so, as what sort, etc. By contrast, the term
“grammatical relations” has come to be understood as referring to the grammaticalization
of particular “macro-alignments” of grammatical functions, as they are reflected in and/or
made use of in various and potentially quite diverse areas of the grammar (Andrews
1985). While there is nothing approaching widespread agreement concerning the
applicability of both concepts (in the same way or at all) to all languages, it seems to me
that their application in this way leads to a reasonable description of the grammar of Galo.
The following three subsections will present an overview.
14.1.1. Transitivity, argument structure and “macro-roles”
I take the terms transitivity and argument structure to indicate two semi-distinct
viewpoints on the same overall linguistic property, which is the number and status of
noun phrases which are required to be present in a clause if a particular sense of the
predicate is to properly obtain; “transitivity” seems to imply a more predicate-oriented
stance (i.e., one speaks of the “transitivity” of verbs), while “argument structure” seems to
imply a more noun phrase-oriented stance (i.e., we speak of the “number and status of
(noun phrase) arguments”), and that is all.
By macro-roles I intend the conventional assignment in Basic Linguistic Theory
(beginning with Dixon (1979)) of “syntactico-semantic” labels S, A, O and E to the
following argument types, according to the transitivity of the clauses in which they occur:682S
A
O
ESingle argument of an intransitive clause
More controlling/actor-like argument of a transitive clause
Less controlling/acted-on argument of a transitive clause
Extension to the core of an atransitive, intransitive or transitive clauseThese labels are first used in a lexical-semantic sense, to refer to the set of “core
arguments” for which a particular predicate word is specified (§5.2.4); so, for example, a
419Htransitive sense of də́m- ‘hit’ has two core arguments A and O as part of its lexical
specification, and this lexically-specified argument structure may or may not undergo a
subsequent set of restructuring derivations (i.e., “valence-changing” derivations; cf.
§11.2.5) prior to reaching the final projection of a predicate word when it is uttered in a
4192Hclause.
The labels are also employed with a clause-level, syntactic sense, to refer to the
realization of a predicate’s arguments by particular noun phrases in a clause (§9.2); so, for
4193Hexample, two noun phrases, each with a set of independently definable properties, occur
in any clause headed by transitive verb root də́m- ‘hit’.
Accordingly, the following set of core argument structures are established, in
which S, A, O and E refer both to the set of core arguments assigned to a predicate and to
their syntactic realization in a particular clause headed by that predicate, and (OBL) refers
to any number of oblique (a.k.a. “adjunct”, “peripheral” or “non-core” noun phrases).
Oblique noun phrases may provide some additional information regarding, but do not
directly support, the core sense of the predicate (Figure 14.1).

realizations
The literature abounds with proposals as to how the relationship between semantic
roles, argument types and syntactic realizations should be construed, both in universalgrammatical (or universal-cognitive) senses and in senses developed with respect to
683particular languages or types of languages, and assessment of even a small portion of
these proposals nowadays must lie well beyond the scope of a descriptive grammar. I
simply outline here the approach which I have found useful in the analysis of Galo
grammar, and readily concede that any number of more efficient or insightful proposals
may be adduced, either with respect to human language overall or with respect to Galo in
particular. 263

“subcategorized” for a set of zero or more arguments, as outlined in Figure 14.1. Next (in
4195Han analytical rather than procedural sense of “next”), we can understand these core
arguments to be underlyingly associated with a set of semantic types, in the sense of a
lexicon-internal “construction”. Potentially, a large set of verbs may assign a similar or
identical set of semantic types to the same basic set of arguments (for example, a large set
of “state change” verbs may assign Agent and Theme roles to A and O arguments
respectively); or, there may be a more detailed semantic specification of the type of
nominal which can stand in a particular argument position (for example, one existential
verb may subcategorize for an animate S while another may subcategorize for an
inanimate S). In principle, this assignment could be viewed as arbitrary, however in
practice, of course, more agentive semantic roles are generally assigned to the A
argument position and less agentive roles to the O argument position.
Then, we come to the syntactic realization of the arguments in a particular clause,
as they are “projected” by the predicate as a function of its head (usually, a verb, but
possibly also an adjective); at this point only, it becomes possible to talk of “grammatical
relations”, or higher-order alignments of certain argument types in opposition to others. In
Galo, we find good evidence for the grammaticalization of S/A alignment in opposition to
the “core remainder” O and/or E , and may therefore begin to speak of, for example, the
“subject” of a particular clause, as it may be identified in terms of a set of criteria to be
outlined in §14.1.3. The projected instantiations of underlying, verb-subcategorized A, O
4196Hand so on are thus recognized in terms of these identified mapping relations (A onto
“subject”, etc.).
Figure 14.2 roughly schematizes this conception:

It is useful to draw a preliminary distinction between three basic stem types, whichwill be called Type A, Type B and Type C. A Type A predicate stem consists of a single,
morphologically simplex, bound verb root, such as dó- ‘eat’ or ín- ‘go’. A Type B
predicate stem is complex, and consists of a bound verb root plus a stem-expanding
derivation, as in dó-lɨ ̀ɨ ‘eat-DESD’ ‘want to eat’ and dó-kèn ‘eat-GOOD/EASY’ ‘delicious’. A
Type C predicate stem consists of a simplex or complex adjective, such as zèe
‘green/blue’, hɨkɨ ́r ‘cool/cold’ (both simplex) or cɨ ́r-tə̀ ‘CLF:GRAIN-big’ ‘big-grained’
(complex) (Table 10.2).

327H11.1.6.2.5. Native speaker intuition
Finally, we can revisit the question of native speaker intuition. Although speakers
are often comfortable assigning a “standalone” sense to sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] (§11.1.6.2.1), they are less comfortable assigning standalone senses to
3278Hsequences of the form [PDER-x] such as ladù in (425)/(430)/(431). None of my consultants
3279H3280H3281Hhave so far been able to assign a sense to a phonological word of the form [PDER-PDER],
as in (420), reproduced here and bolded for convenience (433).

To briefly summarize this section, we have considered evidence from native speaker
intuitions concerning the capacity for sub-predicate “words” to stand alone, and be
assigned a “standalone” meaning, concerning the capacity for sub-predicate “words” to
clearly pattern as words in the syntax, whether as terms of syntactic constituents other
than the predicate complex or as terms of movement within the predicate complex, and
concerning the morphological status of sub-predicate word “heads”, in terms of whether it
is sensible or not to analyse them sometimes as heads of free syntactic words, and
sometimes not. Overall, I conclude that while it is certain that sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] have grammatical “word” status in many cases, it is not possible to
generalize this status over an entire syntactic category which such sequences could be
said to realize in every case. The evidence for grammatical “word” status of sequences of
the form [PDER-x] is even weaker. Ultimately, it would appear that the only type of posthead syntactic “word” that could be identified within the predicate complex would be one
whose head can be either a predicate derivation or a predicate inflection, which is
homophonous with and functionally identical to bound morphological dependents, and
whose only raison d’être would appear to be the fact of occurrence in third syllable
position in the predicate complex (which is, of course, a phonological rather than a
grammatical fact).
I therefore conclude that the only complete sense in which sub-predicate words in
Galo are “words” is a phonological sense; grammatically, there is no great motivation for
considering Galo predicate derivations as anything other than bound predicate formatives.
Precisely what kind of bound formative they may be is the topic of the next
section.
11.1.7. Morphological status of predicate derivations – roots, suffixes or both?
In the preceding section §11.1.6 we reviewed the phonological and grammatical
3284Hstatuses of sub-predicate “words” in Galo, concluding that while data clearly support the
analysis of sub-predicate words in a phonological sense, data do not generally support an
analysis of sub-predicate words in a grammatical sense. Having concluded that Galo
predicate derivations constitute a category of bound predicate formatives, it remains to
consider their morphological status; i.e., whether they are best analysed as roots, suffixes,
or (in some sense) both. The ultimate question is whether to adopt the analysis
schematized in (434), in which predicate derivations, or some subset thereof, are analysed
3285H476as lexical roots – in some sense equivalent to verb roots – or that of (435), in which
3286Hpredicate derivations, or some subset thereof, are analysed as suffixes.

All predicate formatives in Galo would appear to have the same potential syllable
structure, segmental composition, and capacity for tonal assignment. This means that
there is no way of determining on a purely morphological basis whether a given predicate
formative has lexical (root) or functor (suffix) status. In addition, since there appears to be
no grammatical limitation on the type of predicate base to which a predicate derivation
may be bound, and no clear procedure yet identified for assigning predicate derivations to
a structurally-determined set of position-classes, nor to categorically-determined head or
dependent positions within sub-predicate words (see §11.1.6.2), we are left with a very
3287Hthin set of structural criteria indeed with which to determine the morphological status of
bound formatives of the predicate.
However, one possibility not yet addressed in detail is that of predicate derivations
themselves standing as a predicate head. Surely, if it were possible for a predicate
derivation to stand as the lexical head of a predicate, this would be strong evidence in
favour of its analysis as a bound lexical root rather than a suffix. And, in fact, there are
clear indications that large numbers of predicate derivations have homophonous,
semantically-relatable “counterpart” verb roots. Consider examples (436) through (440),
328H3289Hin which the first sentence has a bold verb root which is homophonous with and
semantically relatable to the bold predicate derivation in the second sentence. Note that477these are surface transcriptions, which therefore bear some formal differences, but that
underlyingly, the bolded morphemes are fully homophonous.

Dozens more such examples may be found, and some of my more reflective consultants
are explicitly aware of the formal and semantic relatedness, not to say identity, of forms
like cèn- ‘know’ and -cèn ‘KNOWING MANNER’ in (439). Predicate derivations with even
3290Hmore detailed semantic values exist, and often have clear correspondences to
homophonous verb roots; for example, consider húk- ‘of a blade, to separate from the
handle to which it is bound as a knife, machete or sword’ and -húk ‘DE-HANDLE RESULT’,
as in tú-húk ‘kick (a knife, machete or sword), with the result that the blade separates
from the handle’.
Even more significant, perhaps, is evidence that speakers are able to alternate their
expression of certain information between verb root and predicate derivational
instantiations. For example, consider the passage in (441), in which Speaker A’s
3291Hrestatement of the predicate in his second sentence could be construed as a case in which
the predicate derivation -càa ‘ASCEND’ is moved to predicate head position; potentially,
such decision would relate to the fact that càa- ‘ascend’ is more semantically general than
478gacàa ‘scale to top’. càa- ‘ascend’ would then be more appropriately deployed in a
sentence in which the focal information is contained in the noun phrase and the predicate
semantics are de-emphasized or backgrounded, as seems to be the case here.

via the shining path.’ B: ‘Uh-huh.’ A: ‘She went back up via the rays of the sun,
you see.’ (NyPB/MN, LAT 323-325)
It seems evident that a patterned relationship exists between the predicate derivation -càa
‘ASCEND’ of Speaker A’s first sentence and the verb root càa- ‘ascend’ of his second
sentence. On this basis, we might go as far as to suggest that càa- and -càa in fact reflect a
single underlying form, which takes on different properties when differently employed
within the predicate morphology, but which has a single underlying cognitive value.
And yet, important as these strong correspondences between predicate derivations
and other types of morpheme may be, they do not apply to all or even the majority of
Galo predicate derivations. In fact, of the 321 predicate derivations currently attested for
Galo (not counting the multiple senses or functions of several of them), only 76, or 23.7%,
have clear verb root cognates. A further 32, or 10%, are potentially cognate with bound
nominal or adjectival roots, although it is less clear in many such cases whether or not an
active synchronic relationship can be said to exist. In any case, this still leaves 213
predicate derivations – almost two thirds of the available data – for which neither I nor
two of my consultants who worked through the entire list of 321 attested predicate
derivations with me in detail have been able to associate with any other root occurring in
the language.
Neither does it appear to be the case that presence or absence of a cognate verb
root (or any other type of root) in the language correlates in any way with what we might
call the depth of grammaticalization of a predicate derivation. That is to say, it appears
neither to be the case that the more functor-like predicate derivations attested in Galo lack
479a cognate verb root, nor that the more semantically particular or idiosyncratic-seeming
predicate derivations have verb root cognates, even as an overall tendency. For example,
the Comitative applicative derivation -gə́ and the Causative applicative derivation -mò are
two of the most abstractly functional of all predicate derivations, having both developed
clause-continuity functionality in addition to clause valence-altering functions (discussed
in §11.2.5.4 and §11.2.5.3 respectively). And yet, they have two of the most clearly
329H329Hrelatable verb root sources we can find: gə́- ‘carry/wear’ and mò- ‘make’. On the other
hand, -mèn ‘PLAYFUL MANNER’ and -kə̀ ‘DEAD RESULT’ (§11.2.1.1) seem so semantically
3294Hparticular that they (intuitively, perhaps) must be expressible as lexical heads – and yet,
they aren’t. 211
210FFurthermore, as was also discussed in more general terms in §2.3, it is almost
3295Hnever safe to analyse a predicate derivation in terms of direct importation of the semantics
of a putatively cognate root, even when they appear clearly relatable. For example,
although the verb root kák- ‘wash surface’ has a clear semantic restriction against
selection of human/animate or clothing O argument referents (for which the separate verb
roots hú- ‘wash a body’ and rɨ ́k- ‘wash clothes’ respectively exist), this restriction does
not apply to the Result derivation -kàk ‘CLEAN’, as shown in (435). Similarly, the
3296HBenefactive Applicative derivation -zí ‘BEN’ clearly relates to the verb root zí- ‘give’, and
a few of my consultants have drawn explicit links between these forms. And yet their
properties with respect to the organization of argument structure in a clause are quite
different. For details, see §11.2.5.2.
3297HFinally, although it is generally the case that predicate derivations are
homophonous with apparently cognate roots, it is not always. For example, PTs *len
‘exit’ has a regular Galo reflex in the Directional predicate derivation -lèn ‘OUT’; however,
its verb root counterpart exhibits a rare, irregular l- → n- / #_ change in nèn- ‘exit’. Such
211The apparent non-correspondence between persistence or decline of the lexical source form of a functor
in Galo and its depth or extent of grammaticalization is a perhaps surprising discovery given the plethora of
correlations between these facts which have been identified in the literature on grammaticalization in
Mainland South-East Asian languages. For example, obsolescence of the lexical source of a putatively
functional serialized verb is routinely employed as an argument in favour of its advanced reanalysis and
structural adjustment (Li and Thompson 1981). Post (2007) even went so far as to suggest that lexeme
obsolescence could have an implicitly causal relation to advanced structural adjustment of functor
morphemes in Chinese. Although the typologies of these languages largely differ with that of Galo – in
particular, the morphemes in question are usually syntactic words in Mainland South-East Asian languages,
whereas in Galo they are bound formatives, and presumably must be assumed to have different cognitive
statuses – the facts we have reviewed here at least suggest that the place of lexeme obsolescence in
grammaticalization theory may require some reconsideration; indeed, it may be of no relevance whatsoever.","[474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480]"
