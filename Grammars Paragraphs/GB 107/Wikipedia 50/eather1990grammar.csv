forms with second person subjects (A) or (S) and always precedes the verb form (V). It
means ‘stop V-ing' or ‘never/don't ever V'. As far as I know it cannot be used to modify
any other word class (i.e. apart from a verb) and it never occurs as part of a composite ofparticles. The restriction to second person subject means that mungana is associated with
negative verb forms that are used as negative Imperative constructions (see also 5.4.2.3.),but, like the standard negative particle korla it does not actually occur with an Imperative
verb form. (Only the negative Imperative particle yingawa ‘don't’ occurs with Imperativeverb forms.) Restriction to irrealisy negative verb forms means that only Contemporary and
Future negative verb forms occur (i.e. C/T NEG and FUT NEG) with mungana. Examples
of mungana occurring with both an intransitive and a transitive verb follow:344(169)Mungana nganjakkamdawa ngiyakawa wunaddjakala.

ve Imperative particle ‘don't (see
5.4.2.3.) and as an interjection meaning ‘enough’,
'no more’. For these functions thegeneral gloss ‘at this/that time' is not appropriate. Positing an homonymous form for thelatter two functions provides no real solution because of thePresence of the same overlap
of form and function in neighbouring Ndjébbana (cf. yalaw
a ). It is, however, quite
another matter to provide the semantic link. The negative Impera
tive function of yingawa‘don't’ and its function as an interjection are easily linked in that both canbe paraphrased as‘no more' or ‘enough’. This in turn throws some light on yet another use of yingawa as anexpressionmeaning‘OK’,‘alright' (2=""good enough"")(cf.a similar use in GuuguYimidhirr , see Haviland (1979:152)) But very little can
be said at this point about the. semantic similarity between the negative Imperative functionof yingawa and the temporalconnective, the adverbial and the foregrounding functio
n. In terms of the two most
disparate functions we can observe that in both the negative
Imperative function and the
temporal connective function the presence of yingawa requires the
cessation of one action
or event and the subsequent introduction of another. In the negative Imperative constructionyingawa indicates an instruction to cease one action/event
, whereupon the subsequentaction/event may or may not be stated. (See examples (123) and (124).)(115) Nakkaliyarra ngirrbakkardabiyana yingawa wakana nginayawa.

basically as morphophonemic padding for the monosyllabic root. A verb-complex
consisting of a pronominal prefix, a monosyllabic root and no tense suffix (such as
bana+ma- or ngiba+rda-Q) is problematic for rules of stress assignment in the language:
primary stress is assigned to the first syllable of the root, but can never occur on the finalsyllable of a word with two or more syllables. So, the monosyllabic root takes an
increment which then carries the primary stress.Monosyllabic root increments for irrealis

The requirements of epistemic modality in Nakkara mean that because the potential is
unfulfilled, a verb following this particle will always have irrealis status, and is usually in
negative mood. If a cause, reason or excuse for the unfulfilled potential is mentioned this is
usually introduced in the clause following by the particle agarra ‘and(new)', ""but’

"The function of ngarra is to introduce new information. It can serve to highlight a changeofparticipants between two clauses or a switch of actions or events with
