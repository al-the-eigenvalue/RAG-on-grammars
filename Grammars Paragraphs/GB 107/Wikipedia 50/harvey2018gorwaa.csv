AUX2.6.2 Negation
Negation is accomplished in Gorwaa by the enclitic =ká(ng). The following provides
an overview of verbal negation, nominal negation, and clausal negation (in Gorwaa,
derivational negation (such as the un- in English unhappy), has not been identified).
Finally, a creative usage of the enclitic =ká(ng) is described.
2.6.2.1 Verbal negation
Negative clauses are marked by the negative clitic =káng (often reduced to =ká).
This clitic attaches to verb roots only if the roots have been extended by the suffix -a
(in the present tense) and -i (in the past tense).

Negative morphology may be applied to a constituent not to negate it, but to
emphasize its superlative or astonishing nature (2.261).

"Prohibitive Prefix mThe prohibitive prefix m- (Mous 1993: 151-152) is used in two primary ways. First,
it is employed with the two negative imperative suffixes (-aar, and -ara’) to
complete a negative imperative construction (2.190). Second, it is employed with
the background suffix (-wa) to express negative commands for all persons other
than 2nd (which are covered by the imperative forms) (2.191).

In why questions in which the state of affairs seems unexpected or is surprising in
some way, the adverb bere may be used as a stronger alternative to question
morphology. A possible English translation is ‘whyever’.

several, seemingly disparate morphosyntactic environments, including on the object
of comparison (2.245), on nouns quantified by umó (2.246), as part of the negative
morphology for nominals (2.247), and on polar questions (2.248).",[179]

Because the DM architecture is built around a phrase structure grammar, section
3.2 provided an introduction to Minimalist syntax, its components and its
functions. Section 3.3 provided a stepwise derivation of a simple sentence in the
language of examination: English. Section 3.4 introduced DM as an architecture
within which i) syntax applies to morphemes n the same way in which it applies
to words and ii) pronunciation and meaning are fed by feature bundles (List 1)
structured and mediated by the syntax.","[210, 211]"

Semantically, several groupings for number have been established directly above.
However, syntactically (i.e. as instantiated through agreement), number has two
values in Gorwaa: singular (Sg) and plural (Pl). The only category to show number
agreement is the adjective. Full paradigms for each of the three inflectional patterns
for adjectives can be found in Table 2.10 in §2.3.3.1.

Gender “polarity”
A final pattern of which to take note is that, when changed for number, the syntactic
gender of a noun may also change. This phenomenon, dubbed “gender polarity” by
Meinhof (1912: 18-20) has since been identified as a salient characteristic of many
Cushitic languages (see e.g. Hetzron 1967). For example, a singular noun which
triggers (F) agreement on target adjectives, verbs, etc. can pluralize to a noun which
triggers (M) agreement on those same target adjectives, verbs, etc. Compare the
verbal agreement of desu ‘girls’ with that of garma ‘boy’ in (2.67) below:982. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa(2.67)GENDER POLARITY: DESI (F) ‘GIRL’ AND DESU (M) ‘GIRLS’

This section will first treat left- and right- dislocation, then repetition.
Left- and right-dislocation
Left- (2.249) and right-dislocation (2.250) are both commonly employed special
constituent orders. Pragmatically, dislocated elements are focused. Left-dislocation
is not fronting, because there is a referential pronoun in the main clause.

the residents of the fields of Ayasanda in the process.
Dr. Kathryn Ranhorn helped me to look at Gorwaaland as part of a larger Rift Valley
area, and my work as part of a larger humanist picture.
At the University of Dar es Salaam, my thanks, as always, to my Masters-level
supervisor and current host Dr. Henry Muzale, as well as Dr. Josephat Rugemalira,
who first suggested I work on Gorwaa -- both formidable minds who never allowed
me to forget the primacy of the empirical data above the appeal of a convenient
theory.
At the school of Oriental and African Studies, my thanks to Dr. Martin Orwin and Dr.
Peter Austin, my second and third supervisors, respectively. As for Dr. Lutz Marten,
my first supervisor whose magnanimity, franchise, and patience (derived, it must be
remembered, from the Latin ‘to suffer’) I doubt I shall ever properly repay, I know of
few other people who would make a trip to Kilimanjaro to check in with how their
student is doing -- fewer still who could cut through the complexities of a language
like Gorwaa to determine those fundamental questions that I so badly needed to be
asked.
Thanks are due to the staff at the Endangered Languages Archive, who helped me
turn my data into information, available to virtually anyone, free of charge. The
ability of readers to resolve the Gorwaa material back to the original utterances is a
central feature of this dissertation, and simply would not have been possible7without their expertise in metadata, data management, and the vicissitudes of
technology.
Dr. Soung-U Kim, who read virtually the entire first draft and responded with deeply
useful comments, and Samantha Goodchild, who provided commentary on parts of
the introduction, gave vital alternate viewpoints on organization and content: a
resuscitating breath for an author in a post-draft stupor.
Dr. Hannah Gibson and Dr. Rozenn Guerois, life of the party that was Bantu group,
have been, in academic terms, the older sisters that I never had, and despite both of
their frenetic schedules, neither have ever found themselves too busy to offer
support or guidance. The friendship, hospitality, and help provided by the
remainder of the Bantu group and other hangers-on (as myself), including Dr. Peter
Edelsten, Chiku Lijongwa, Dr. Nancy Kula, Dr. Sheena Shah, and Elisabeth Kerr,
won’t soon be forgotten.
Sections of this dissertation have been presented in various forms at the Aldrich
Interdisciplinary Conference in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, March 2014; the
SOAS Linguistics Student Research Conference in London, UK, June 2016; the CELC
Postgraduate Workshop, Cambridge, UK, July 2016; CALL 46 in Leiden, the
Netherlands, August 2016; NACAL 45 in Leiden, the Netherlands, June 2017; CALL
47 in Leiden, the Netherlands, August 2017; and the LAGB Meeting in Canterbury,
UK, September 2017. My thanks to the audience members and individuals who
provided detailed feedback. My thanks also to Dr. Jason Merchant, Dr. David Adger,8and Dr. Hagit Borer, each of whom took the time to provide some feedback on
specific parts of the formal analysis.
To Jan and the English countryside, the easy companionship of whom seems to
blend together, I owe many of the happiest memories of my time here.
My mother, father, and younger brother have always believed in the value of my
work, and in my ability to do it. During times when I questioned myself, this proved
the single most valuable kind of support. Thank you.
Needless to say, all errors found in this dissertation are mine, and mine alone.

1.1 Why Gorwaa? Why the noun? Why formalism? A note on motivations.
Gorwaa (ISO 639-3: gow), a South Cushitic language spoken in north-central
Tanzania, is an endangered language, about which very little is known or
available to linguists. Beginning in 2012 and extending to present, I have had the
privilege of spending long periods of time living with speakers of Gorwaa in and
around what may be construed as their traditional homeland of Babati district,
conducting audiovisual documentation of their language. This work is one early
output of that documentary and descriptive fieldwork.
While learning to speak the language (an ongoing feat, it must be admitted),
perhaps one of the most mind-boggling tasks (or group of tasks) was using
nouns correctly. Simply put, as a speaker of English (with some familiarity with
both French (fra) and Swahili (swa)), I found ‘getting the nouns right’ in Gorwaa
very difficult indeed. Four examples of this characteristic difficulty are outlined
below:
TONE: Nouns must be pronounced with the appropriate tone, otherwise they are
either misunderstood or deemed incorrect. The noun aalutumo ‘inheritor ♂’
must therefore be pronounced with low tone, and the noun tlaptumó ‘falcon’
must be pronounced with high tone. Several noun pairs exist whose meaning
differs solely in whether they are produced with low or high tone. Thus, the
word for ‘drum’ is niinga, and the word for ‘pigeon species’ is niingá. The word
for ‘night’ is amsi, versus the proper name Amsí (typically given to a boy or girl
born at night).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

2.1 Introduction
Among other things, the previous chapter discussed some of the wider context
(historical, cultural, sociolinguistic) in which the Gorwaa language exists (see
§1.2), as well as the research methodology used during data collection (see §1.3).
What follows is a preliminary sketch of Gorwaa, written with two central
purposes in mind. First, the sketch provides descriptive material on the main
points of Gorwaa grammar: both the most cross-linguistically common features,
as well as those most peculiar to the language. As a language with no previous
description, this is meant as an empirical contribution to understanding the
language in general. Second, the sketch ought to ground the reader in a basic
understanding of the noun phrase and associated phenomena such as agreement
– the theoretical and analytical focus of the thesis.
The sketch begins with an overview of Gorwaa phonetics and phonology (§2.2).
It is followed by a presentation of the lexical categories of the language (nouns,
verbs, adjectives, adverbs), with an excursionary remark on ideophone (§2.3).
Next, the fuctional categories (determiners, selectors, and pronouns) are
examined (§2.4).","[72, 73]"
"As a separate remark, it is worth noting that n and the root function autonomously
in some respects (e.g. the √-n combination may be separated by Cl and #
morphology, as in (6.39)b)), but that they also have the linguistic properties of a
single domain (e.g. √-n combinations have idiomatic meanings, as outlined in §6.2.3
above).
(6.39) N AND THE ROOT FUNCTION AUTONOMOUSLY IN SOME RESPECTS
a.
/aráy

[√ -n]
b.

b.

These behaviors are also characteristic of verb-particle constructions in Germanic
(e.g. Ramchand & Svenonius 2002), and preverb constructions in Old Irish (sga:
Ireland†) (e.g. Adger 2006). Examples (from Ramchand and Svenonius (2002: 101)
are provided in (6.41) and (6.42) below.

"3836. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
(6.42) THE VERB AND THE PARTICLE HAVE THE LINGUISTIC PROPERTIES OF A SINGLE DOMAIN
a.
They let up the pressure.
b.
They let the pressure up.
At this point, no further insight will be given into the parallels in syntactic behavior
for the √-n relationship and the V-particle relationships mentioned above. With that
said, it is worth noting the similarities at this point, in hope of further insight in the
future.","[383, 384]"
"2.6 Pragmatically marked structures
Pragmatically marked structures convey salient information structure (focus,
contrast, topicalization), as well as negation, and non-declarative speech acts. Each
will be examined below.",[177]
"6.3.5 Characteristic (e): gender ‘polarity’
The grammatical gender of a noun (M, F, or N)3 is determined by the SFX2
component of the suffix. Each SFX2 has a fixed gender value. As can be seen
below, the SFX2 -i consistently triggers F agreement (6.13), the SFX2 -ó
consistently triggers M agreement (6.14), and the SFX2 -a’i consistently triggers
N agreement (6.15).",[353]
"2.3.5 An excursus on ideophones
It must be noted that ideophones in Gorwaa do not form a lexical class per se.
Instead, they are distributed throughout the lexical categories of the language. As
such, they will be briefly be examined here as a conclusion to the subsection on
lexical categories.
Gorwaa makes extensive use of ideophones – that is, words which depict their
referent, rather than denote it. As an English example, the verb ‘call’ in the phrase
‘the birds are calling’ denotes the action undertaken by the birds, but the verb
1302. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa
‘tweet’ in the phrase ‘the birds are tweeting’ depicts the action undertaken by the
birds, in that it mimics the sound produced. Idiophones are, therefore, iconic in
nature, and give rise to different subtypes of ideophone according to the subtype of
iconicity: direct, Gestalt, and relative (Dingemanse 2018). Each is examined, with
examples, below.","[130, 131]"
"The thesis structure reflects the twofold nature of its goals: Chapter 2 is an (entirely
descriptive) introduction to the language, and Chapter 3 is an (entirely formal4358. Conclusion
theoretical) introduction to the method of analysis. The remaining four chapters
each feature descriptive sections, followed by sections of analysis.
Chapter 2 offers a grammatical sketch of Gorwaa. As a language with no previous
description, this is meant as an empirical contribution to understanding the
language in general. Second, the sketch ought to ground the reader in a basic
understanding of the noun phrase and associated phenomena such as agreement –
the theoretical and analytical focus of the thesis.","[435, 436]"

132,748The total yielded by this exercise is 132,748. This number represents, to the best
of my knowledge, the total possible number of Gorwaa speakers. A more
nuanced figure can be arrived at by adding up only those areas which I believe
Gorwaa to be actively spoken and used in everyday life (shaded above): this
yields a total of 79,751. These two numbers would suggest that, taken together,
60% of Gorwaa speakers are using Gorwaa actively. The remaining 40% may
391. Introduction
know Gorwaa, but are probably not using it extensively, nor passing it on to their
children.
1.2.3.2 Language use
Further tentative generalizations may be reached from personal observation.
Based on interactions observed among Gorwaa families, the language falls
somewhere between 6b and 7 on the Expanded Graded Intergenerational
Disruption Scale (EGIDS) (Lewis and Simons 2010). EGIDS Level 6b describes a
threatened language status: one in which the language is not being passed onto
children reliably enough for numbers of speakers to remain stable into the
coming generations. As time goes on, “there will be fewer speakers or fewer
domains of use or both” (13). EGIDS Level 7 describes a shifting language status:
a situation in which the language is clearly not being passed on to younger
generations.
In Babati Town, parents of Gorwaa families commonly understand Gorwaa, and
may use Gorwaa among themselves in the home. Children, however, either
understand Gorwaa but do not use it, or may only know basic items such as
greetings and how to form questions. Either way, it is rare to observe Gorwaa
children using Gorwaa, even in the home. The language used outside the home,
in virtually all interactions, is Swahili. Barring a further, more nuanced,
examination of language use among Gorwaa people in this urban setting, Gorwaa
may be assessed as 7 (shifting) in Babati Town.
More rural areas (Babati District) see more robust use among all generations,
even the youngest, but the domains in which Gorwaa is used are increasingly401. Introduction
restricted. Virtually all speakers of Gorwaa also speak Swahili (see Appendix A),
and it is considerably more common to hear Swahili being spoken in social
spaces (at the shop, at worship, etc.) than Gorwaa. Public life (see Muzale and
Rugemalira 2008) is dominated by Swahili: school, healthcare, and most all
interactions with government officials of every level is conducted in Swahili. In
the home and among neighbours, Gorwaa may still be heard, but code-switching
is ubiquitous2. Rapid societal change (introduction of new farming methods and
technology, arrival of electricity, cash-based trade, mobile phones, computers,
etc.) brings with it entirely new semantic domains, virtually all of which are seen
as more efficient to talk about in Swahili than Gorwaa. As such, though
intergenerational transmission of Gorwaa is occurring in these rural areas, the
language is clearly losing domains, and the competence of younger speakers
must be seriously questioned. Gorwaa may therefore be assessed as 6b
(threatened) in Babati District.
Language of early schooling (roughly ages 5-13) in Tanzania is Swahili, with
English as a taught language. Later schooling (roughly ages 14-19) is in English,
with Swahili as a taught subject. Virtually no schools offer provision for local
languages (i.e. languages which are not Swahili or English), either as languages of
instruction or taught languages. Historically, literacy (in Swahili) among Gorwaa
speakers was very low, with a marked improvement in the Ujamaa period
following independence in 1961, followed by a decline following restructuring of2 Though very common in most speech situations, code-switching is relatively rare inthe corpus (though see [20151025], and [20150811c-f]). This might be explained by the
fact that those recorded knew that the research was being conducted on the Gorwaa
language, and were therefore conscious to ensure they were speaking in Gorwaa, and
not Swahili.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"What must remain ‘exceptional’ (at least for Gorwaa), is the manner in which a given
root comes to be associated with a given paradigm. It seems to me that the selection
of roots by paradigms is lexical, both in the sense that the paradigm and the root
both contribute to the meaning of a noun (e.g. soo’ay ‘dog’ vs. se’eengw ‘hair’), as well
as in the sense that, like matching an appropriate noun with an appropriate verb to
construct a coherent sentence, so too must a speaker match an appropriate root
with an appropriate paradigm.",[377]

Furthermore, recent psycholinguistic work on the Cushitic language Konso (kxc:
Ethiopia) investigated how native speakers process grammatical gender and
number (Tsegaye 2017). Using picture-word interference and simple picture
naming tasks to determine whether the equivalent of Gorwaa N gender in this
language was processed as a gender value or a number value, it is argued that:
“[if N] is a value of gender in Konso, naming utterances with [N]
gender should produce similar congruency effects as masculine and
feminine genders. Conversely, if such effects were absent in naming
utterances with [N] gender but present only in masculine and
feminine gender, [N] would not be treated as a value of gender.
Combined, compared to the gender-congruent condition, genderincongruent distractor words slowed down the latencies of the
target pictures significantly. Crucially, the results of the two
experiments displayed that [N] gender nouns show gender
congruency effects like masculine and feminine nouns. This indicates
that [N] is processed in the same way as masculine and feminine
genders, which supports the analysis that [… N gender] is indeed
part of the system of gender features in Konso.” (22)
It is important here to note that evidence for Konso cannot be generalized to all
Cushitic languages (Somali and Oromo, for example, are systems with
straightforwardly M vs. F genders). However, within Cushitic, Mous (2008)3897. The linker
identifies what is essentially the same pattern of Konso in Bayso (bsw: Ethiopia),
Dirayta (gdl: Ethiopia), Ts’amakko (tsb: Ethiopia), Rendille (rel: Kenya), Boni
(bob: Kenya), as well as Iraqw, Alagwa, and Burunge. It is on the back of this
experimental evidence, as well as on the basis that positing N as a gender value
makes for an overall simpler analysis for Gorwaa, that this three-gender analysis
will be adopted.","[389, 390]"

As may be seen, in certain cases (such as adjectival number agreement), the
analyses yielded by the new formal approach are virtually the same as those
yielded by the former functional approach. In other cases (such as
encapsulation), the analysis frames the phenomenon in a different way. In still
other cases (tonal pairs, linkers), the two approaches lead to two final analyses251. Introduction
so different that they will surely result in visible differences in, say, glossing for a
descriptive grammar of the language. What ought to be noted is that, though
each pair of analyses uses a very different approach and, occasionally, arrives at
a very different interpretation of the phenomenon, no single one yields an
‘answer’. Ultimately, each of these interpretations will have their use in the
description of the language and, when taken together, represent a richer view of
the phenomena at hand. It is in this spirit of complementarity that the current
work adopts a formal approach, and it is hoped that the insight derived from it
will stimulate future thought and inquiry.
Specifically, the theory which informs the formal approach taken in this work is
Distributed Morphology (DM) (Halle & Marantz 1993, 1994). Because much of
what follows treats the noun as a complex of smaller parts, DM seemed the most
obvious framework to follow. Because DM asserts that sub-word components
(i.e. morphemes) enter into structural relationships according to the same
mechanisms which drive the structuring of phrases and clauses, the same vision
of the syntax (i.e. Minimalism) may be adopted at all levels throughout the work.
The remainder of this chapter situates the Gorwaa language within its larger
social and historical context, and provides details on the methods and
methodology used to collect the data used herein.
Following this introduction is a general sketch of Gorwaa. Providing a general
introduction to the language, this chapter is intended as both an empirical
contribution to a language for which no previous description was available, as261. Introduction
well as to ground the reader in some basic concepts which will be further
elaborated in following chapters.
The third chapter is an introduction to the formal model employed in the
linguistic analysis: the Minimalist Programme and Distributed Morphology.
The fourth chapter discusses the core subject matter of the work: the noun.
Following some discussion on wordhood criteria, the noun is established as
composed of three major parts: the stem, the suffix, and the linker. The
remainder of the chapter provides a formal DM analysis of the Gorwaa noun
stem.
The fifth chapter turns to the suffix. Morphosyntactically complex, suffixes are
identified as having phenomena which may be described as regular as well as
phenomena which may be described as listed. This chapter treats the former
characteristics, and the following chapter treats the latter. With this established,
an overview of the regular phenomena ensues, as well as a detailed presentation
of the suffixes of Gorwaa. From a formal (DM) perspective, these regular
characteristics are accounted for as products of feature bundles being
manipulated in the syntax.
The sixth chapter treats the listed phenomena of the suffix. Following an
introduction to the idea of declension class (or paradigm), an overview of the
listed phenomena is given, as well as a detailed presentation of the paradigms
into which noun suffixes enter in Gorwaa. Formally, these listed phenomena are
accounted for as realizations of rules post-Spellout.","[24, 25, 26, 27]"
"This section provides an analysis in the Distributed Morphology architecture to
account for listed phenomena. Firstly, if roots are to be considered truly acategorial,
this must be accomplished without resorting to root diacritics indicating
declensional class (Acquaviva 2008: 1-3). The initial challenge, therefore, is to
ensure that the nominal paradigm (aka declension class) is somehow available post-3646. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
spellout, but not as part of the lexical root. This is addressed in subsection 6.4.1.
Subsection 6.4.2 proposes that the 178 paradigms of Gorwaa are encoded as 178
different version of n, provides a revised tree structure which consolidates the
Gorwaa suffix paradigm into the syntax, and gives an initial description of how
paradigmatic material is realized post-Spellout. Subsection 6.4.3 returns to the Cl
head and accounts for its post-Spellout realization. Subsection 6.4.4 addresses the
final listed phenomenon: characteristic (e): gender ‘polarity’, specifically, how
gender is realized post-Spellout, and how Agree must therefore be a kind of
postsyntactic operation.","[364, 365]"
"Further functionalcategories are often highly syntactically restricted to a small number of grammatical
constructions. These will be introduced along with their grammatical construction,
in the following subsections 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7.

Possessive determiners occur as suffixes to their head noun, and, and agree in
person and number with the possessor. The head noun occurs with a linker (see

Demonstrative determiners in Gorwaa occur as suffixes to their head noun, and
encode four different levels of deixis: 1 -í (-ká for nouns of neuter gender), near to
speaker; 2 -síng (often reduced to -sí), near to the addressee; 3 -qá’, distant from
both but within view, and 4 -dá’, distant and out of view. The head occurs in longform. Demonstrative determiners are glossed Dem, along with the level of deixis
expressed.","[133, 134]"

Almost immediately, this table belies the diversity of previous work on South
Cushitic, as well as what is to be covered in the current work. For example, Mous
and Kooij (2006) represents a particularly structurally-oriented treatment of
incorporation constructions in Iraqw. Additionally, this work does occasionally231. Introduction
discuss certain phenomena from a historical perspective (see esp. §5.3.6.2 on the
reanalysis of loanword endings). Simply put, functionalism and formalism must
be seen to exist as poles of a continuum, and this work, as well as other related to
it, though located more toward one pole or another, will rarely occupy one of the
extremes.
With that said, it is useful to return to the four introductory ‘difficulties’ of
Gorwaa outlined above, and to contrast how they have been approached in the
past and how they have been approached in the current work. Using these four
cases (each roughly representing a different modality of the grammar), one can
see how the past analyses and the present analysis differ in terms of formal
versus functional orientation.","[22, 23, 24]"
"4.3.1 Orthographic boundaries
The first commonly-cited criterion for identifying a word are orthographic
boundaries. The assumption is that, Gorwaa-speakers who are acquainted with a
writing system which conventionally separates words with spaces (such as
Swahili and English) will generalize this spacing convention to Gorwaa, writing
what they perceive as words with a space before and after. The data used to test
this hypothesis are examples of the Gorwaa language as written by Gorwaaspeakers unacquainted with either formal linguistic analysis, or the standardized
Gorwaa writing system. Throughout the samples of informal Gorwaa
orthographies recorded in the corpus, nouns are consistently separated from2194. Fundamentals: nominal structure and noun stems

especially the object nouns (na/ay ‘child’ (written NAAY) in (a), and yiikwa

orthographic units.

conduct recordings was very difficult indeed. Regarding contexts of work with
women, though I made a couple of recordings from inside a kitchen, this was
considered an extraordinary exception. In addition to this, though recordings of
groups of men discussing village politics or conflict resolution were made, no
such equivalent exists for a group of women. In order to somewhat mitigate this,
a special ‘women’s focus group’ was brought together on February 20th of 2016
for a day of recorded discussion, specifically of women’s issues, however, for
obvious reasons, this context can only be seen as contrived.
The oldest speaker was estimated to be born in 1912 (100 years old at the date
he was first recorded for the project), and the youngest was born in 2003 (12
years old at the date he was first recorded for the project). Mean age across all
126 participants was 51 years in 2015.
An effort was made to include speakers from all major areas of Gorwaaland, and
records on where each participant grew up shows that most major towns and
villages are represented. With that said, a bias remains in favour of the areas in
and around Endabeg village, where the researcher lived and worked during most
of the data collection. Least represented are the communities in the southeast of
Gorwaaland, as well as those which lay between the foot of Mount Kwaraa and
the Tarangire plain. This is largely due to these places being sparsely populated
and difficult to get to by road, as well as their ethnically-mixed nature: some
village quarters in these areas having no speakers of Gorwaa whatsoever.
7 participants were Gorwaa monolinguals: typically very old indeed, and having
spent all or most of their lives in one or two rural villages. 98 further601. Introduction
participants were bilingual in Gorwaa and Swahili. The 21 individuals who could
speak three or more languages invariably spoke Swahili, as well as other nearby
languages (Rangi (8), Iraqw (4), Alagwa (3), Datooga (1), Nyaturu (1)), the
official language English (11), or languages associated with faith or business
(Arabic (1), Somali (1), Mandarin Chinese (1)).

they were born and where they grew up, sex, language(s) spoken, father’s

1.3.2 Data collection
A basic workflow (based on that provided by Bowern 2008 (48)) describing how
most of the data was processed during this project is provided in Figure 1.1
below.
The majority of the audio recordings were made using a Zoom H2 Handy
Recorder, which produced files in .wav format. .mp4 video recordings were
made using a JVC Everio GZ-HD40EK video camera, and the video function on a
Nikon D7000 camera equipped with a 50mm Nikor lens. Typically, in all cases in
which video was recorded, audio was also recorded using the audio recorder,
and the two were later synchronized (see below). For situations in which the
participant (or participants) is moving, the audio recorder was linked to an
Audio-technica AT803b Lavalier (lapel) microphone, both of which were carried
in a backpack by the participant while the researcher made video recordings
with the video recorder while following along.","[59, 60, 61]"
"321. Introduction
took control of the region, largely bringing a definitive end to large-scale raids
from both the Datooga and Maasai, and allowing the area occupied by the
Gorwaa to be consolidated as what is now considered Gorwaaland.
The account above runs the risk of reducing the relationship of the Gorwaa and
Datooga to one of cat-and-mouse antagonism. In fact, the interplay of these
cultures is much more complex and nuanced. Lexical borrowings from Datooga
into Gorwaa are common in semantic fields such as cattle diseases and plant and
animal names (Kießling & Mous 2003: 33), and many place names in Gorwaaland
are Datooga in origin. In fact, older speakers of Gorwaa often report that at least
one of their parents spoke Datooga, or identified as a Datooga person
themselves. To this day, Datooga traditional doctors, as well as historical figures
such as the Datooga prophet Saygilo Mageena, are held in high regard. Suffice it
to repeat Kießling, Mous, & Nurse (2008) in saying that “[t]he Tanzanian Rift
Valley is an area with a long period of contact with unstable power relations in
which the directions of influence changed over time [...]” (2), the GorwaaDatooga dynamic described above representing just one moment in this long
interplay of different peoples.
Colonial rule (as part of German East Africa from 1885-1919, and as part of
Tanganyika Territory (ruled by the British) from 1922-1961), saw a
reorganization of Gorwaa society, with the existing hereditary chiefdom given
unprecedented power, serving as a proxy for the German and then the British
colonial administrators. Power was placed in the chiefs’ hands to collect taxes, to
arrest and imprison criminals and dissenters, as well as to impose fines for noncompliance with large colonial projects, such as compulsory military service331. Introduction
[20151202e]. From this arose a strict hierarchy, at the top of which was the
wawutumo ‘chief’, followed by the ga/awusmo ‘overseer, sub-chief’, followed by
the ya/abusmo ‘steward, ward secretary’ followed by the boyimo (from the
English ‘boy’): ‘village headman’. Particularly popular stories from this era
include those relating to the communal clearing of the forests across Gorwaaland
in order to rid the region of tsetse flies, as well as to open the land to agriculture
[20151202d]. It was at this time that the Gorwaa began to settle to the north as
well as to the east of Mount Kwaraa.
Independence from Britain in 1961 saw the creation of the country of
Tanganyika, and the abolition of the chiefdoms. From independence until the
mid-1980s, the country (renamed Tanzania upon union with Zanzibar in 1964)
was a socialist one-party state. During this time Gorwaaland was a remote part
of the large Arusha region, and the Gorwaa people continued to live traditionally
as farmers and pastoralists. Babati, the largest urban centre in the area,
remained a small outpost town, served by a post office and a health centre
[20150805].
2003 marked the beginning of a period of great change in the area, when the
Arusha region was divided in two, its southern half renamed Manyara, and
Babati declared the regional capital. This has spurred a sudden, intensive influx
of development (paving roads, building government offices, opening banks, retail
businesses, etc.) as well as sizeable migration of people to the new capital: both
from within the region as well as from other regions. Increasingly, electricity is
arriving in the towns and villages all around Gorwaaland, and paved roads and
bridges are opening up communities to the commerce, culture, and language of341. Introduction
the national majority. Time will tell how the Gorwaa people will respond to
these recent titanic shifts.
1.2.2 Language family
Gorwaa is a member of the Southern Cushitic group of the Cushitic family - itself
a branch of the Afro-Asiatic phylum. The exact position of South Cushitic within
Cushitic is a matter of some debate, with Greenberg proposing Southern Cushitic
as an independent branch of Cushitic (equal with Northern, Eastern, and Central
Cushitic), and Ehret (1995: 490) including Southern Cushitic within Eastern
Cushitic. An internal classification of Southern Cushitic is presented in Figure
1.1.

Kießling and Mous (2003: 2-3) note that classification of Southern Cushitic is a
challenge for several reasons. Firstly, of the East-Rift branch, both languages are
now assumed to be extinct, with only small amounts of lexical data remaining
(see Ehret (1980a+b) for Qwadza, and Ehret (1980a), Fleming (1969), Merker
(1910), Maguire (1927/1928), and Winter (1979) for Aasax). Secondly, Ma’a of
the Mbugu Branch is best described as a ‘mixed language’ (Mous 1994), featuring
Bantu morphology and two registers: one containing Cushitic roots and the other
of Bantu origin. Because of this, inclusion of Ma’a in any genetic classification
351. Introduction
proves problematic. The status of Dahalo, whether Southern Cushitic, Eastern
Cushitic (Blazek & Tosco 1994), or neither (Rowe 2000), is, ultimately, unclear.
As such, Kießling and Mous (2003) focus on the internal classification of WestRift, presented in Figure 1.2.

Gorwaa
The internal classification is useful: for example, Gorwaa and Iraqw are mutually
intelligible, which is reflected here in the relatively late split between the two
languages. Limitations, however, do exist. Contact has played a large role in the
development of all four of these languages, and cannot be represented
genetically. For example, in the nominal suffixes -iimi, -aCzee, and -aCzu occur in
both Gorwaa and Alagwa (whose language communities currently border each
other), but not in Iraqw (which no longer borders Alagwa). Lexical borrowings
from Alagwa into Gorwaa are also present.
Mutual intelligibility between Gorwaa and Iraqw is high, with several recordings
having been made of Gorwaa speakers addressing Iraqw speakers with no
apparent issues of comprehension [20150913a], [20150913d], [20150927a-f].
The two languages do, however, feature some considerable differences. In
addition to the nominal suffixes noted above, Gorwaa also shows a different
agreement pattern with several adjectives in the plural form: compare the Iraqw361. Introduction
muukú buuxayén with the Gorwaa muukú buuxáx (‘grey people’). The marker for
third person agent is also different: compare the Iraqw guna diif with the Gorwaa
nguna diif (‘he hit it(M)’). Syntactically, Gorwaa seems to feature a somewhat
freer argument order than Iraqw: post-verbal nouns which index arguments,
such as the Gorwaa ina tláy gofaangw (‘the buck went’), are considered either
strange or ungrammatical in Iraqw.
1.2.3 Language use and attitudes
This subsection treats language use and attitudes, 1.2.3.1 discusses the number
of speakers, 1.2.3.2 discusses language use, and 1.2.3.3 discusses language
attitudes.
1.2.3.1 Number of speakers
Estimates of the number of Gorwaa speakers vary greatly. This is largely due to
the fact that no dedicated language survey has been conducted for Gorwaa, and
very little was known about the linguistic makeup of communities in and around
Gorwaaland. Ethnologue (Simons & Fennig 2017) currently puts speaker
numbers at 50,000. This figure is from Kießling’s (1999) historical
reconstruction of South Cushitic - and seems to be an educated guess. Indeed,
the following year, Kießling (2000: 1), revises this estimate to 100,000 speakers.
In a 2007 manuscript, Mous estimates the number of Gorwaa speakers at “about
fifteen thousand speakers or less”. In comparison with the Iraqw people expanding and culturally dominant in the region (and whose language is the
main focus of that particular work) - Gorwaa does seem a minuscule quantity.
The first methodologically rigorous figure for Gorwaa speakers comes in the
Atlasi ya Lugha za Tanzania (LOT 2009), in which informants (mainly university371. Introduction
students who grew up in the administrative region of interest) were asked to
indicate which languages (up to five) were spoken in each area (villages for rural
areas and streets for urban areas) shown in the population census database
(Tanzania Government 2002), as well as estimate what percentage of people
spoke which language. Project researchers then spent 6 weeks in all regions of
the country during July-August 2006 filling gaps and assessing the validity of
informants’ estimates (Muzale & Rugemalira 2008: 78-79). The number of
Gorwaa speakers resultantly recorded in the Atlasi was 112,941 (LOT 2009: 3).
In an attempt to arrive at a yet sharper conclusion, I recorded population figures
from the latest available census data (Tanzania Government 2014) for each ward
within both Babati Town and Babati District - the area within which Gorwaaland
is located - and made an estimate on what percentage of inhabitants speak
Gorwaa. An additional 2,500 speakers have been added to places where small
communities or individual families of Gorwaa speakers may live which are
outside of the survey area (places like Mto wa Mbu, Arusha, and Dar es Salaam).","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"
"Encapsulation and change in valency
Note also that when the object argument is located between the selector and the
verb (a configuration known as ‘encapsulation’ (e.g. Whiteley 1958, Kießling 2007)),
it is not marked on the selector. That is to say, a selector which otherwise would
have marked an A and a P for a transitive verb (2.156)a), will now only mark one
argument. This argument will be marked as if it were S, and therefore as if the1452. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa

1.2.4 Linguistic Environment
The eastern branch of the East African Rift is unique in that it is the only area
where all four major African language phyla (Afro-Asiatic, Khoisan, Niger-Congo,
and Nilo-Saharan) have been in sustained contact. The convergence in parts of
the grammatical structures of the languages in this region has led Kießling, Mous
& Nurse (2008) to propose a Rift Valley Linguistic Area, comprised of the 13
languages shown in Table 1.4.

ten Raa (2012)Today, Gorwaaland is located roughly in the geographic centre of this linguistic
area. With that said, not all of the languages presented in Table 1.1 are in any
sort of regular contact with Gorwaa. Day-to-day contact between contemporary461. Introduction
Gorwaa communities and other languages is largely limited to Iraqw, Rangi,
Mbugwe, Alagwa, and Datooga.
Cultural ties and everyday contact between Gorwaa speakers and Iraqw
speakers are strong and frequent. In addition to arrivals of Iraqw farmers in the
northwestern villages of Gorwaaland over the past several generations,
communities all along the B143 road from Babati to Katesh are, more or less,
mixed Iraqw-Gorwaa. Intermarriage between Gorwaa speakers and Iraqw
speakers is common. Gorwaa speaking elders and traditional leaders were often
observed travelling to Iraqwland in order to help resolve conflicts, and
customary leaders (including chiefs, rainmakers, and traditional doctors) of both
ethnicities regularly meet to conduct major rites. As mentioned above, Gorwaa
speaking youth mix with their Iraqw speaking counterparts in urban areas
including Babati, Mbulu, Katesh, Dareda, and further afield, Arusha, which has
lead to the emergence of a larger Mbulu identity, comprising both.
Similarly, contact between Gorwaa speakers and Rangi speakers is also very
frequent. Communities toward the south and east of Gorwaaland, such as Bonga
and Galapoo are typically mixed Rangi-Gorwaa. Perhaps due to religious
differences (the majority of Gorwaa speakers are Christian, while most Rangi
speakers are Muslim), intermarriage and greater cultural integration is not as
profound as that of Gorwaa and Iraqw.
Gorwaa and Mbugwe communities are in contact to the north of Gorwaaland, and
towns such as Magugu and Kiru are mixed, with speakers of Gorwaa and
Mbugwe living and working side-by-side.","[45, 46, 47]"

2.4.2.7 Adverbial case
The only adverbial case affixes (Mous 1993: 152-154) attested thus far are the
reason suffix -s, the instrumental suffix -r, the lative suffix -i, and the ablative suffix wa.
Reason Suffix -s
The reason suffix is typically used with the temporal copula to produce a
construction with the meaning ‘the reason why...’.

To this point, the instrumental suffix has only been found on encapsulated nouns,

the difference between an encapsulated noun ending in the linker -r~´~ and the
instrumental suffix -r is that the form taking the instrumental suffix lacks the high
tone.

sel < √ > ; NThis chapter addresses those patterns of Gorwaa suffixes which are ‘listed’:
requiring recourse to more detailed explanations of realization rules postSpellout (i.e. material from List 2 and List 3). Embick (2003) notes that “[a]ll
approaches to grammar must assume that some information is simply listed”
(144). Essentially, in English, the difference in grammaticality between two men
and *two man can be explained by recourse to the same sort of syntactic
structures as discussed in Chapter 5. However, the difference in grammaticality
between men and *mans is of a different nature. That is, it is not the expression3386. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
of number value [plural] on the noun which is illicit (as men is a valid plural
form), but rather the manner in which it is expressed for this particular noun.
Whereas singular-plural pairs such as ban | bans, can | cans, fan | fans are licit,
man | mans is not. The man | mans error is not one of feature bundles being
manipulated by syntactic operations (ban | bans illustrates that such a
configuration is syntactically licit), rather, it is an error of how that structured set
of feature bundles comes to be realized for that particular form. In order to
recognize the ungrammaticality of man | *mans, and the grammaticality of man |
men, one must simply know that this is the way this particular word works.
Knowledge is not of the syntax, but of the particular lexical item: it is listed.
Embick goes on to state that “[h]ow this information is listed, and whether or not
listedness correlates with grammatical phenomena in a systematic fashion, is a
significant research question” (2003: 144).","[338, 339]"

position between the selector a and the verb. Looking at the functions of
selectors (they may mark clause type, deixis, subject, object, aspect, mood, and
adverbial case), it may be assumed that they are a form of highly inflected
auxiliary (cf. Anderson, 2011). Indeed, Mous (2005: 308) identifies the selector
as marking “the left hand edge of a syntactic unit”, a syntactic unit which I will
interpret as TP. As such, anything between the selector and the lexical V is
therefore within the TP and, furthermore, if located between the selector and the
lexical V, within a phonological phrase, hence the pronunciation of the linker on
nouns in this position.","[398, 399]"

the economy to a capitalist model, which began in 1986. Today, while many
Gorwaa speaking children do attend school, education may be disrupted or not
completed depending on the economic fortunes of the family. Illiteracy among
young adults is not uncommon. Literate Gorwaa speakers will be literate in
Swahili (which employs the Roman alphabet), and possibly English.
In 1977, an Iraqw translation of the Old Testament was produced by the
Tanzania Bible Society which employed a writing system developed principally
by the Catholic mission at Tlawi. As an appendix, a glossary of Gorwaa terms
were included in order to make the book useable by the Gorwaa speaking
Christian community as well. Though the book (nor Gorwaa-language worship)
never became particularly widespread, it did establish the Iraqw writing system
as the standard for Gorwaa as well. With that said, a great diversity of nonstandard writing conventions are in use (e.g. [20150815m], [20150920n],
[20151001z], [20151127g], and [20151127h]), and the language is not very
commonly seen in written form.
In addition to the Gorwaa of everyday interaction, several specific genres of
Gorwaa also exist. Though these have not been given enough attention so as to
be discussed in any great detail, they will briefly mentioned below.
Riddles, a common way of passing the time following the evening meal and
before bed, are often based on guessing the identity of a cryptic description. A
teller will pose their riddle, and others will provide a guess. If nobody guesses
correctly, the riddle either goes unanswered, or may be ‘bought’ from the teller421. Introduction
by offering a village, town, or city (I once observed a particularly good riddle sell
in exchange for all of Canada).

[20130206b_20150720b.3-7]
My calabash is small,
It has two mouths,
And has much oil that never runs out.
[Answer: the nose]
Another speech genre is the firoo: a litany-like pronouncement, usually asking
for the intercession of the indigenous god Loo’aa. The contents of the firoo
seems relatively variable, and I have yet to observe the more formulaic slufay as
described for Iraqw (Thornton 1977, Wada 1978, Kamera 1987/1988, Beck &
Mous 2014).
As a genre, Gorwaa song represents a diverse array of material, often associated
with particular events or occasions. Wedding songs (e.g. [20160229n]), dancing
songs (e.g. [20160120h]), songs of praise and songs of victory (e.g. [20151004f]),
farming songs (e.g. [20150903f]), and circumcision songs (e.g. [20151202a]) are
all examples which have been recorded. Certain songs are typically only sung by
men, such as some of the Mandaa songs (e.g. [20160927c]), and certain songs are
typically only sung by women (e.g. [20160225t]).

[20151001w]). To date, over 250 recordings of Gorwaa songs have been made.
The mystical monologues (or perhaps dialogues) into which traditional doctors
enter during the performance of various rites represent another genre of speech.
Due to the secretive nature of this type of speech, the only recorded examples
are that of the diviner reading stones in order to determine a client’s prospects
(e.g. [20151003d-e], [20151211c-e]). Cursory examination shows these sessions
are highly structured, and feature specialized vocabulary.
1.2.3.3 Language attitudes
As with language use, no dedicated survey of language attitudes has been
undertaken for Gorwaa, and as such, the generalizations made here are tentative.
Overall, there appears to be a rather sharp divide in language attitudes,
particularly in terms of age, as well as identification with a rural versus urban
way of life. Typically, older Gorwaa speakers from rural areas tend to be most
enthusiastic about their language, seeing it as useful in the widest range of
domains, and valuable as a badge of a culture with which they strongly identify.
Younger Gorwaa speakers in more urban areas tend to view Gorwaa as being
less useful in day-to-day life, and, in some cases, tend to be somewhat
embarrassed to be heard speaking Gorwaa, especially when non-Gorwaa
speakers are present. A large proportion of younger speakers have gone so far441. Introduction
as to eliminate the concept of Gorwaa altogether, in favour of the exonym
‘Mbulu’. Mbulu, name of the largest Iraqw settlement, has recently emerged to
subsume both the Iraqw and the Gorwaa peoples, cultures, and languages, and is
perhaps the most common way for both Gorwaa and Iraqw youth to refer to
themselves. Resultantly, many young Gorwaa speakers typically refer to
themselves as of Mbulu ethnicity, and to the language which they speak as Mbulu
or Kimbulu. Superficially, this simply represents the adoption of a new title, as
the language which speakers use remains the same. In the longer-term this
perhaps represents a larger shift to Iraqw, as the Gorwaa are most certainly the
minority within this neo-ethnicity.
With that said, there has been considerable interest from Gorwaa speakers of all
ages in the work surrounding the current Gorwaa language documentation, with
the contribution of some (considerably elderly) consultants resulting in a large
body of data (such as songs, traditional justice, and uncommon or archaic
vocabulary) being collected in a relatively short period of time. Younger
speakers directly involved in the translation and transcription of the material
have become researchers in their own right, and are taking increasing ownership
of the project, and ultimately the documentation and description of their own
culture. Such energy would seem to suggest that those exposed to the full
richness of the language tend to approach it with new esteem, and may be a
route to explore should the speaker community ever desire to further valorize
Gorwaa.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"191. Introduction
LINKERS: All nouns possess a short form and a long form. The short form of the
noun meaning ‘cow’ is slee, the long form of the same noun is sleér. Long form
morphology (in this case, the high tone and the -r) is referred to in the South
Cushitic literature as the linker, and is mandatorily present in constructions
showing nominal possession, or other concepts of modification (e.g. sleér aakó
‘grandfather’s cow’ and sleerí ‘this cow’), but is also present in other
constructions which are clearly not modificational in nature (e.g. aní a sleér diíf ‘I
hit the/a cow’).
ADJECTIVAL NUMBER AGREEMENT: Some nouns can take adjectives agreeing in either
singular or plural, resulting in slight changes of meaning. For example, the noun
tsaxway ‘grasshopper’, could occur with an adjective like tleér with either
singular agreement (i.e. tsaxwáy tleér) or plural agreement (i.e. tsaxwáy tlét). In
the case of singular adjectival agreement, the resultant meaning is something like
‘a long grasshopper’; in the case of plural adjectival agreement, the resultant
meaning is something like ‘a long swarm of grasshoppers’ or ‘a species of long
grasshopper’. Conversely, some noun suffixes (like the masculine suffix -(a)mó)
only allow singular adjectival agreement (hence daka’umó tleér ‘a tall baobab
tree’, but not *daka’umó tlét (with an intended meaning of something like ‘a
species of tall baobab trees’); and some suffixes (like the neuter suffix -(a)du)
only allow plural adjectival agreement (hence suledú tlet ‘tall schools’, but not
*suledú tleer). However, while many suffixes can be described as taking only
singular adjectival agreement (like -(a)mó), taking only plural adjectival
agreement (like -(a)du), or taking both (like masculine -ay), other suffixes do not
behave according to this generalization: some suffixes, it seems, can sometimes201. Introduction
take either singular or plural adjectival agreement, but sometimes cannot. For
example, the noun loosí ‘beans’ (suffix -í) can occur in the construction loosír
tleer ‘a long species of bean’ (i.e. singular adjectival agreement) and the
construction loosír tlet ‘long beans’ (i.e. plural adjectival agreement); however,
the noun bi/iní ‘silky blesmol’ (with the same suffix -í) can only occur with
singular adjectival agreement: hence, bi/inír tleer ‘a long silky blesmol’, but
*bi/inír tlet (intended meaning, ‘a species of long blesmol’).
ENCAPSULATION: In addition to occurring outside of the verb phrase, nouns may
also occur inside of the verb phrase, between the auxiliary (i.e. the selector) and
the main lexical verb -- the so-called ‘encapsulated position’. Therefore, in the
clause aní slee aga diíf ‘I hit the cow’ the noun slee ‘cow’ is outside of the verb
phrase (i.e. in ‘un-encapsulated position’), whereas in the clause aní a sleér diíf ‘I
hit the cow’, the noun slee is inside of the verb phrase (i.e. in ‘encapsulated
position’). As may be seen from the direct translations of each clause, the
difference in position does not result in a difference in terms of content as such,
but of the weight of that content. Unencapsulated nouns may refer to newlyintroduced entities in the discourse, whereas encapsulated nouns rarely, if ever,
perform this function.
These phenomena, among others, range from fairly straightforward to
considerably complex and, collectively, are the reason why the current work is
dedicated to the Gorwaa noun. Addressing these patterns provides impetus for
deep exploration of Gorwaa morphosyntax and, ultimately, detailed grammatical
description of the Gorwaa language: the long-term desideratum of the broader
project.","[19, 20, 21]"

(1.3) ENGLISH SCRIPT FOR ORAL CONSENT DIALOGUE
-I want to talk some things over, so that we understand our work. Is that
alright?
-You have the right to stop working with me at any time, and you don’t
have to tell me why you want to stop.
-You will be paid X Tanzanian shillings per hour of work, or products
equal to this value. Is this alright?
-Is it alright if our work is recorded with a voice recorder or video
camera? I record our work so I can ensure that I heard the words
correctly, and so other people can listen to the words and stories later.
-If you are uncomfortable with being recorded, we can turn off the voice
recorder and video camera at any time. You don’t have to give a reason
why.
-Is it alright if other people listen to or watch the recordings we have
made? Other researchers? Students? Your family? Other people from
this area?
-Is it alright if I tell other people that you are working on the Gorwaa
language with me? For example, is it alright if I put your name on a list of
people who have contributed to this work? If not, is it alright if I refer to
you by a made-up name? (ask for alias)
-Is it alright if I put our work in a language archive? A language archive is
a place where you can put work like this, so that even if my personal
copies are destroyed or damaged, the work remains safe.
-Is it alright if I write (books) about the Gorwaa language?
-Is it alright if I use this work for other purposes? For example, perhaps
today I have made a recording to help me understand the sounds of
Gorwaa. Is it alright if I listen to this work at a later date to learn about
the words or the grammar of Gorwaa?
-Thank you, I have finished all of my questions for you. Before we begin
our work, do you have any questions you would like to ask me, or
anything you would like to say to me?
Typically, participants were paid a salary of 4,000 Tanzanian shillings per hour
of work. Time worked referred to time spent with researcher, even if this was
not recorded. Rehearsing narratives, doing ‘practice-runs’ of elicitation
questions, finding suitable locations to record, etc. all counted toward paid time.
In 2015, 4,000 Tanzanian shillings was equivalent to approximately 1.85 GBP. A
Tanzanian secondary school teacher at the lower end of their pay-scale in 2015
could expect to earn approximately the same. Thus, this was an hourly amount
which seemed commensurate with the skill set of a language consultant.
Participants who were known in the community as specialists (diviners or581. Introduction
traditional healers, for example) would sometimes be paid slightly more. In
most cases, participants were paid in cash. In some cases (such as individuals
dealing with issues such as gambling addictions or alcoholism), salaries were
paid in commodities such as sugar, rice, or airtime vouchers.
126 Gorwaa speakers are represented in the sample.4 With this said, however,
the amount of material from each participant varies greatly, from over 20 hours’
worth of targeted elicitation with one participant, to perhaps a single utterance
in the background of a group discussion from another. Indeed, I estimate that
10% of the participants make up for close to 80% of the recordings.
Of the participants, 88 were male and 38 were female. This disparity in gender
representation was due to several factors, the most important perhaps being that
I am male, and I was therefore often limited in the age range of women with
whom it was deemed appropriate to have contact, as well as in what kinds of
women’s domains I could effectively work. For example, older women were
generally deemed appropriate to work with, whereas opportunities to work with
younger women around my age were not very common. This also has to do with
the disproportionate amount of labour expected of younger women: with
virtually all domestic duties considered the job of women, finding time to4 This figure excludes recordings made of large groups, such as the Subira ElimPentekoste Adult Choir of Endabeg, the Yerotoni Cultural Group, or the Group at Ayá
Manangu on 09/10/2015, during which it was deemed impractical (or simply
impossible) to collect information on each individual present. In terms of permission,
informed consent for group recordings was sought from group leaders (such as the
choir conductor for the church choir) or heads of a household (e.g. Manangu Qamsilo for
the recording made at his home). If the group was an established entity (such as the
Yerotoni Cultural Group), remuneration was made in the form of a donation to the
group. If the group was less established (such as the group at Ayá Manangu), a suitable
remuneration was discussed with the owner of the household (in that particular case,
remuneration was in the form of a large crate of soda).","[57, 58, 59]"

“Just as atoms are the building blocks of matter, bonding in various
fashions to form complex molecules, the noun class prefixes
combine to form paradigms. Stretching the metaphor a little
further, it is of little explanatory value if one tries to explain the
properties of matter, to know that a substance contains for
example hydrogen and carbon atoms ‒ an information [sic] that
pertains to thousands of substances with widely differing
properties ‒ without knowing which kind of bonds and molecules
are formed by these atoms.”

6.3 Overview of the listed phenomena
This section expands on each of the listed phenomena associated with the
Gorwaa suffix. These are repeated in (6.4) below.
(6.4) THE LISTED MORPHOSYNTACTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GORWAA SUFFIX
a.
A given noun stem takes a set of suffixes, known as a paradigm.
Paradigms may occur in three different shapes: monads, pairs, or triads.
Paradigms may be composed of different types of suffixes.
b.
The paradigm taken by any given noun stem is unpredictable.
c.
A given noun stem may have more than one paradigm. Selection of
paradigm may or may not affect the semantic interpretation of the resultant noun.
d.
Suffixes unvalued for number may have the kinds of agreement with
which they may occur restricted by the shape and composition of their paradigm.
e.
The grammatical gender (i.e. M, F, or N) of a noun is determined by
the SFX2 morpheme, which has a stable association with gender. If a noun is
changed for number, its gender may also change.
Each characteristic will be discussed in its own subsection below. Subsection
6.2.1 treats characteristic (a): the paradigm: content, shape, and texture.
Subsection 6.2.2 treats characteristic (b): the unpredictability of the paradigm.
Subsection 6.2.3 treats characteristic (c): multiple paradigms for a given stem.
Subsection 6.2.4 treats characteristic (d): paradigmatic effects on number value.
Subsection 6.2.5 treats characteristic (e): gender ‘polarity’.","[342, 343]"

"211. IntroductionIndeed, this ‘project’ does not exist in isolation: interest in the description of the
wider South Cushitic language family is not without its scholarly tradition,
beginning with Whiteley’s (1958) A Short Description of Item Categories in Iraqw
and gaining considerable advances with the Iraqw grammars of Nordbudstad
(1988), Mous (1993), and the major historical survey of Kießling (2002). A long
list of papers may also be added to this list, including those focused on historical
reconstruction (e.g. Kießling 1998, 2004, Mous 1996, and Kießling & Mous 2003)
as well as description of specific grammatical constructions (e.g. Kießling 2007,
Mous 2004, and Mous and Qorro 2010). Specifically, this work seeks to engage
in this body of description in two ways. Primarily, by treating a South Cushitic
language which has, to present, been underrepresented in literature on the
family, this work will broaden the empirical basis upon which work about South
Cushitic is conducted. Additionally, this work aims for a different perspective on
South Cushitic, namely in taking a formal approach to questions which, to
present, have been treated from a functional stance.
The division of formal and functional approaches is not neat, and runs the risk of
being essentialist. As stated in Carnie and Harley (2003) “[t]here is very little
agreement among linguists about which particular assumptions or
methodologies mark one as a functionalist or a formalist” (1). With that said, the
identification of some common dimensions along which formalist and
functionalist approaches differ, and the keys ways in which those differences are
manifest will prove useful in orienting this work in relation to past work on
South Cushitic. The following table is based on Carnie and Harley (2003:2), itself
based on Croft (1995) and Newmeyer (1998).","[21, 22]"
"The configurations of the Gorwaa paradigms examined in this work are actually
somewhat simpler than the English example above, in that they deal with less
features. An example is given in (6.27) below4.

To conclude this introductory clarification, what is being referred to as a nominal
suffix paradigm in this work would translate to other DM accounts as a declensional
class: that is, a pattern which dictates how a feature or set of features will be
realized by the grammar post-Spellout. Returning to the English example in (6.26),
the feature [past] is not realized on all verbs by the vocabulary item -d. The verb
sing, for example, is realized not as sing-d, but as sang. Because the verb sing
realizes its features in a different way from play, the two verbs must belong to
different declensional classes. In this work, one would say that they belong to4 The vocabulary item generated by a [plural] feature is obviously not generated here in itsfinal form. The adaptation of -a’i to -a’ would have to be accomplished in this model
through a readjustment rule.",[366]
