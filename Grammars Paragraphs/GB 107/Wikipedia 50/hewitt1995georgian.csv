5.1.13.6 Questions with raising
Questions of the type 'Who do you think will gain the victory?', which
involve the question-word being raised out of its own clause, are formed in
GEORGIANby asking two separate questions—the first takes the form 'How
do you think?', whilst the second asks the basic question with the questionword remaining in its own clause, producing for this particular example:
ro+gor (Ø-?Ø-)pikr-ob?
vin
how
(you-?3rd.PER-)think-TS(PRES) who(NOM)
ga-(?Ø-)i-marjv-eb-s?
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)SV-be.victorious-TS(FuT)-X
5.1.14 Negation
5.1.14.1 Prohibition
The negative particle reserved for making prohibitions is nu. It is used
with the Prešent Indicative (if the aspect is progressive) or with the Future
Indicative (if the aspect is momentary) for all three persons, e.g.
maga-s
nu
that(2nd.DEIXIS)-DAT not
'Don't do that!'
nu gv-e-äin-i-al
not we-IOV-fear-PRES-?it
'let us not be afraid!'ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb!
PREV-(you-it-)NV-do-TS(FuT)However, an alternative, more polite method of expressing negative
imperatives is to combine the adverb ar 'not' with the subjunctive mood57ØGEORGIANGRAMMAR(usually the Aorist), e.g.
eg
at-i
k'ap'ek'-i

that(2nd.DEIXIS) 1Ø-AGR kopeck-NOM not PREV-(you-it-)NV-throwAOR.SuBJ-Pl
'Don't (please) drop that 1Ø kopeck-piece in (sc. the honesty-box)!'
Though the prescriptive division between 'nu + Indicative' and 'ar +
Subjunctive' is clear, the mixed construction 'nu + Subjunctive' is also
found, e.g.
gul-ma
nu
(?Ø-)i-xar-o-s
heart-ERG not(PROH) (?it-)SV-rejoice-AOR.SuBJ-it
'let the heart not rejoice!'
Indeed, there is an old formula where this coupling seems to be the
norm, viz.

God-ERG

notmo-(Ø-)gv-i-šal-o-s!
PREV-(it-)us-OV-depriveAOR.SuBJ-he'May God not deprive us of you!'

5.1.14.2 Potential
Where negation is combined with the notion of ability (viz. 'cannot/could
not'), one can avoid using the unmarked negative adverb ar in association
with the lexical verb meaning 'X is possible for Y' by employing the special
potential negative form ver with an indicative of the very verb whose
action is stated to be impossible, e.g.","[587, 588, 589]"

707PREFACEThis work began with the aim, consistent with the general goal of the
Benjamin-SOAS series of which it is a part, of presenting the essential
structural characteristics of Georgian for the benefit of general linguists.
As it progressed, however, it turned into something more than this. It had
been my aim to write a reference grammar of Georgian after a further ten
years or so of study, but the request from the Series' editors, Professor
Thea Bynon and Professor Matt Shibatani, to contribute a description of
Georgian happened to coincide with an unforeseen rift in my relations with
Georgia which is unlikely to be repaired. And so, rather than continue to
study this language, to which I was introduced seriously in 1975 when I
travelled to Tbilisi as a Cambridge post-graduate student for a year of
intensive learning on a British Council exchange, as, now of necessity for
me, a virtual dead language, I decided that it was time to kill three birds
with one stone. In marshalling here the sum total of the knowledge that I
have acquired over the last twenty years I hope (a) to have satisfied the
faith placed in my ability by Professors Bynon and Shibatani to write a
grammar of use for the general linguist, (b) to have produced a worthwhile
reference-grammar (the first in English) that it had always been my desire
to compose, and (c) to end thereby the period when Georgian has
represented the main focus of my study and research. If I succeed in
easing even a few people's passage through the waiting mysteries, I shall
conclude the last 20 years to have been well spent.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"NON-VERBALMORPHOLOGY813.5.4 Negative (uar+q'+op+it-i) Pronouns
Depending on whether one wants the neutral, potential or prohibitional
pronouns one has a respective choice of ara-vin, vera-vin, nura-vin
for 'no-one', or again for 'no longer anybody' the choice is a-gara-vin,
ve-gara-vin, nu-gara-vin; the declensions follow that of vin? above.
The parallel choices for 'nothing'/'no longer anything' are ara-per-i/agara-per-i, vera-per-i/ve-gara-per-i, nura-per-i/nu-gara-per-i
respectively; these decline like any syncopating consonant-final noun.
An older alternative to ara-per-i is ara-ra, or just ara. An example
of this last would be: ara-s (= ara-per-s (ar)) v-i-t'q'v-i 'I shall say
nothing'. The longer of the alternatives is today usually only found when
its constituent parts are split by the verb, as in the traditional start to
fairy-tales (viz. i-q'+o da ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was
nothing' = 'once upon a time'). For the potential equivalent vera in the
phrase vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you won't be able to achieve
anything' cf. mag kad+il-it vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i-t, bič'-eb-o
'with that impudence you won't manage to achieve anything, lads'.
3.5.5 Indefinite (gan+u+sa+zgv+r+el+ob+it-i) Pronouns
Indefinite pronouns exist with the suffixes - m e for non-specific
indefiniteness and -ga+c for specific indefiniteness; they are based on the
human and non-human interrogative pronouns. The basic (and easiest)
declension-pattern fuses the particle to the root and then adds the casedesinence, but alternatives are available. We start with vin-me 'anyone':

3.5.6 Relative (mi+mart+eb+it-i) Pronouns
The relative pronouns are produced by suffixing -c to the appropriate
interrogative pronoun with the relevant case-endings. The relative
pronouns are: v i n - c 'who', r a - c 'which', r o m e l - i - c 'who, which',
ra+m+den-i-c 'as many as', ro+gor-i-c/ra+nair-i-c/ra+gvar-i-c 'of
which type'. Any clitic postposition will precede the suffix (e.g. v - i s tvisa-c 'for whom'); when the postposition is -ze, it may expand to -zeda
(e.g. romel-ze(da)-c 'on which'); when it is -ši, it may expand to -ái(d)a
(e.g. ra-ái((d)a)-c 'in which'). When the relative pronoun is accompanied84GEORGI AN GRAMMARby a free-standing postposition or, if Genitive, by a head-noun, the suffix
will either attach to the final word of the phrase in which the relative
pronoun stands or will be absent, e.g.
k'ac-eb-i,
roml-eb-is col-eb-i(-c)
man-PL-NOm who-PL-GEN wife-PL-NOm(-REL)
'the men whose wives are here...'
cf. k'ac-eb-i,
wives...'.roml-eb-isa+k a+r-i-an
here be-PRES-theycol-eb-is-gan(a-c) 'the men from whose3.5.7 Reflexive (uk'u+kc+ev+it-i) Pronouns
The noun tav-i 'head' serves as reflexive pronoun. It is either used by
itself, e.g.
tav-i
mo-v-(Ø-)i-k""al-i

PREV-(you-it-)SV-kill-AOR
mo-(Ø-)i-k'l-a
PREV-(it-)SV-kill-X(AOR)
'I/you/X killed myself/yourself/X's self'
or in association with the appropriate possessive adjective, e.g.
čem-s
tav-s
še-v-(Ø-)e-k'itx-e
my-AGR self-DAT PREV-I-(it-)IOV-ask-AOR
'I asked myself
vs äen-s tav-s še-(Ø-Ø-)e-k'itx-e 'you asked yourself' vs č v e n - s
tav-s še-v-(Ø-)e-k'itx-e-t 'we asked ourselves' vs tav-is tav-s Se(Ø-)e-k'itx-a 'X asked himself/herself/itself'.
3.5.8 Emphatic (xaz+ga+sm+it-i) Pronouns
The indeclinable emphatic pronoun is t(v)+it+on 'self'; variants are the
shorter tv+it (in origin a syncopated variant of the Instrumental of tav-i
'head; self) or tav+ad (the Adverbial of tav-i 'head; self). Standing quite
alone the emphatic pronoun may function as either aNOMINATIVEor
Ergative case; otherwise it stands alongside the case-form of the word it
emphasises (e.g. t(v)+it+on/tv+it/tav+ad c'a-vid-a 'X(NOm) went
himself/X went herself/X went itself; t(v)+it+on/tv+it/tav+ad m o (Ø-)k'l-a i+s kal-i 'X(ERG) killed that woman himself/X killed that woman

3.5.9 Reciprocal (urt+i+ert+ob+it-i) Pronouns
The two pronouns are ert+man+et-i and ert+i+me+or+e 'each other,
one another'. Although the analysis of both is transparent, the first
containing the cardinal '1' in the Ergative case (= -man-) followed by an
abbreviated form of itself, the second containing theNOMINATIVEform of
the same cardinal followed by the ordinal '2nd', the pronouns behave like
unanalysable wholes and serve as objects, changing for case accordingly
like normal consonant-final and vowel-final nouns respectively, e.g.
axal+ga+zrd-eb-i ert+man+et-s/ert+i+me+or+e-s

3.5.10 Possessive (k'utvn+il+eb+it-i) Pronouns
Essentially there is a unified pattern that is followed in the formation of
every type of possessive pronoun: take the Genitive of the relevant
pronoun, treat this as the stem for the possessive, and simply add the
appropriate case-ending to this new stem to suit the context—in the
NOMINATIVE such forms are ambiguous, being either the possessive pronoun
or the equivalent possessive adjective. The Dative, however, usually ends
in -a-s (often used in the sense of 'at so-&-so's place'). According to
Tschenkéli, there is no Genitive case, but I give what would surely be such
a Genitive below in the conviction that, if one needed to make one of these
pronouns the object of the Genitive-taking verb 'fear', one could have
recourse to just such forms. Let us take as the starting illustration the
reflexive possessive tav-is-i 'one's own' vs tav+ian-t-i 'their own'—N.B.

3.6. Particles'each(na+c'il+ak'-eb-i)3.6.1 Interrogative Particles
Though OldGEORGIANformed 'Yes-No' questions by means of the clitic
particles -a and -me, the modern literary language does not (cf. 5.1.13.1),
though some mountain-dialects still employ -a.
Leading questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain xom, those
expecting the answer 'no' contain xom ar/ver (cf. 5.1.13.4).
An element of surprise is introduced into a question by means of either
of the particles gana or nu+tu (cf. 5.1.13.5).
We have seen the particle -ga used with interrogative pronouns to
lend them the nuance of 'pray, on earth' (cf. 3.5.3). Less restrictedly such a
nuance can be provided by such particles as gana,
nu+tu,
vi+to+m/mitam, net'a(v(i)), e.g.
gana ra

For the conjunctional role of vi+to+m see 5.2.2.3.2.
3.6.2 Conjoining Particles
The clitic particle -c(a) 'too, also' is used; when attached to a word ending
in a consonant, it must be preceded by the vowel -a-, e.g.
mankana-c
ga-v-(Ø-)t'ex-e
car(NOM)-too PREV-I -(it-)smash-AOR
'I smashed the car too'89NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYWhen used in the way just illustrated, it can be substituted by
a+g+re+t+ve 'also' (e.g. a+g+re+t+ve mankana ga-v-(Ø-)t'ex-e). In a
series of conjuncts, the clitic may be attached to each (functioning as
equivalent to 'both...and') and accompanied by the conjunction da 'and', e.g.
p'arask'ev-sa-c tov-d-a
da k'vira-sa-c
Friday-DAT-too
snow-I mPERF-it and Sunday-DAT-too
'it snowed on both Friday and Sunday'
The sequence -c k'i is the equivalent of 'even', e.g.

3.6.3 Indefinite Particles
The use of the non-specific -me and the specific indefinite -ga+c in the
formation of indefinite pronouns was described in 3.5.5.
3.6.4 Speech Particles
The analysis and function of the three particles -me+tk+i, -tko/-tkv-a,
-o are presented in 5.2.2.3.1.2.
3.6.5 Response Particles
Affirmative replies are indicated by diax, k'i, ho 'yes' (most formal,
neutral, least formal respectively). Negative responses are shewn by ara
'no' or vera 'no (Potential)'.
3.6.6 Relative Particle
-c(a) added to interrogative adjectives, pronouns and
produces the equivalent relative forms, as described earlier.adverbs90GEORGI AN GRAMMAR3.6.7 Emphatic Particles
We have already met -ve combined with some demonstratives. Attached
to the numeral '2' it gives or-i-ve 'both'. In association with other
numerals it means 'all NUmERAL' (e.g. otx-i-ve (ǰar+is+k'ac-i) 'all 4
(soldiers)'). In general its attachment adds the nuance of 'the very same,
just, precisely', e.g.

'So what is interfering with you? (sc. nothing is)'
ak'i is something akin to English 'look' (e.g. ak'i (Ø-)g-i-txar-i! 'look,
I have told you!').
Suffixed to the conditional conjunction tu the particle k'i gives us the
form tu-k'i meaning 'if indeed'.
The element tu, possibly functioning alone as a sort of abbreviated
condition, can add the sense of 'if at all' to an expression, e.g.
bodiš-i
jnel-ad
tu mo-(0-)a-rč-en-s
apology-NOM difficult-ADV if
PREV-(it-)NV-heal-TS-it(FUT)
mo+grex+il k'iser-s
twisted
neck-DAT
'an apology will only with difficulty (sc. if at all) heal a twisted neck (sc.
one who is destroyed/defeated)'
tu is also found in the negative phrases ara tu, which is synonymous
with ara mxolo+d 'not only' (cf. 5.2.1), and tu ara da, which is
synonymous with both t o r e m 'otherwise' and the full expression
c'ina+ag+m+deg še+mtxv+ev+a-ši 'in the opposite circumstance', e.g.

alive-NOM PREV-[I -]come(FUT)tu ara da mo-v-kVd-eb-i
otherwise
PREV-I-die-TSFUT.INDIC
'I shall come (back) alive, otherwise I shall die'
We have met -ga in the sense of 'pray'. It can also mean 'only', in
which role it equals mxolo+d (e.g. gušin-c'in-ga (= mxolo+d gušinc'in) mo-k'vd-a 'X died only the day before yesterday').
dae/de(e) (which derives from the imperative d a - ( 0 - 0 - ) e - x s e n
'leave off it/let it be!') is used to strengthen commands, e.g.

5.22.3.1.6 Indirect Questions
As long as it is clear from the context to whom the question refers, one
always has the choice of repeating the original question with the
appropriate speech-particle. Yes/No-questions are treated like alternative
questions containing the words tu ara 'or not', and both end up with these
same words in the indirect question, which shews appropriate changes of

5.22.3.1.7 Fearing Clauses
There is a great variety of strategies available to convey a fear. Perhaps
the simplest way to express a positive fear is to use the appropriate tense
of the indicative, preferably accompanied by the speech-particle and also
by either vai-tu 'woe if' or xom ar 'surely not?', e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a,
vai-tu rus-eb-i
I-IOV-fear-PRES-it
Russian-Pl-NOM
šmo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an(=me+tk+i)

PRES
AOR
'I am afraid that the Russians will attack us // may be attacking us //
may have attacked us'which may be alternatively expressed by replacing vai-tu by xom ar
placed after the SUBJect rus-eb-i. These two variants, which are based
on direct quotation, sit happily alongside any tense in the introductory
verb, so that replacing m-e-šin-i-a above by the past m-e-šin-od-a
would give the equivalents of 'I was afraid the Russians would attack us //
were attacking us // had attacked us'.
An alternative is to turn the fearing clause into a negative wish (sc.
that something may not happen or may not be happening), which joins the
negative particle ar to the appropriate SUBJunctive (viz. Aorist for an
event in the future vs Prešent for one contemporaneous with the fear).
Such expressions may optionally be introduced by the complementiser rom
and optionally accompanied by the relevant speech-particle. The aboveexample in this variation would be:
m-e-šin-i-a,
(rom)

the future after a non-past main verb the Future Indicative, with or
without rom, is possible, e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a, (rom) rus-eb-i še-mo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an

After a past tense introductory verb a fear relating to the future

The above-examples of fearing clauses have exemplified howGEORGIAN
conveys a fear that something may happen / / may be happening // may
have happened. If the fear itself is that something may not happen // be
happening / / have happened, then the complementiser rom is preferably
retained with the negative ar and a non-SUBJunctive verb in the
appropriate tense (apart from the Pluperfect), e.g.","[637, 638, 639, 640]"
"568GEORGIANGRAMMAR5.1.13.3 'Alternative'
The second alternative, either a full clause or just the negative ara 'not',
is introduced by tu 'or'. The verb in the first clause has rising intonation,
whilst the second verb (or the negative ara) carries falling pitch, e.g.
bag-s
mo-(Ø-Ø-)rc'q'-av

PREV-(you-it-)milk-TS(FuT)
or not
'will you water the garden or milk the cow // ... or not?'
5.1.13.4 'leading'
Questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain the particle xom with highfalling pitch on the verb, e.g.
xom
lamaz-i-a
sa+kart+v+el+o?
surely
beautiful-NOM-is
Georgia(NOM)
'Surely Georgia is beautiful/Georgia is beautiful, isn't it?'
leading questions expecting the answer 'no' have this same particle in
association with the appropriate negative, e.g.

fatness(NOM)
not
(3rd.PER-)lV-lack-PRES-it-Pl
'They don't lack fatness, do they/Surely they don't lack fatness?'
Alternatively, the addition of ara 'no' at the end of a simple statement
turns that statement into the equivalent leading-question. The final syllable
of this negative has high-rising pitch. So, the last two examples could
alternatively be expressed respectively as:
lamaz-i-a
sa+kart+v+el+o, ara?
si+m+suk+n+e ar (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a-t, ara?

net'afvj/net'avi can strengthena wish, e.g.net'a me-c
šen-is-tan+a
mo+nadir+e v-i-q'-o!
pray I(NOM)-too you-GEN-like
hunter(NOM) I-SV-be-AOR.SUBJ
'Would that I too were a hunter of your type!'
A peculiarity of such wishes is that one often finds a transitive verb not
only in the Aorist Indicative but with an unexpressed 3rd person singular
subject, e.g.
net'avi axla čem-i tamro
da-(Ø-)m-a-nax-v-a!
let
now my-AGR Tamro(NOM) PREV-(her-)me-LV-make.see-TSX(AOR)
'Would that X would now let me see my Tamro!5, which is virtually the
translation-equivalent of 'would that ƒ could see my Tamro').
3.6.8 Pleading Particles
Peremptory commands can be toned down somewhat by adding ra with a
rise-fall pitch at the end of the sentence (e.g. c'a-Iv-Jvid-e-t, ra! 'let's
go, can't we?', e+s ga-(Ø-)m-i-k'et-e, ra! 'do this for me, please').
Georgian has no simple word for 'please'; the last example could be
rephrased with g - t x o v 'I beg/urge/request you' replacing ra —
alternatively, one could turn the sentence round to give g-txov e+s ga(Ø-)m-i-k'et-o 'I request you to do (= Aorist Subjunctive) this for me', or
again g-txov, e+s ga-(Ø-)m-i-k'et-e (ra)r where the Imperative is
used (with or without the softening ra).
A more or less synonymous effect is achieved by placing mo-di, the
singular imperative of the verb 'come', before the command (with or without
ra at the end).
Use of the cardinal ert-i '1' also has a parallel effect—it is often
combined with aba, e.g.
aba, ert + i,
ča-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-q'ar-o-t
well one
PREV-1 st.PER-(it-it-)OV-cast.down-AOR.SUBJ-PL

ert + ad c'a-[v-]vid-e-t
together PREV-[lst.PER-]go-AOR.SUBJ-PL
'let's just go together'barem
justthough this particle is not restricted to use in commands, e.g.

barem (Ø-)g-i-amb-ob-t
since conversation-NOM-is just
(it-)you-OV-relate-TS-PL
'since it's a conversation I am just relating X to you'
3.6.9 Attention-grabbing Particle
The equivalent of 'lo!' (French 'voilà/voici!') is ai, e.g. ai Sen-i da! 'lo/look,
here's your sister!',
ai e + s k'ac-i-a,
rom (Ø-)g-e-ubn-eb-od-i
lo this man-NOM-is that
(it-)you-IOV-tell-TS-IMPERF-INDIC
'look/lo, this is the man I was telling you about!'
3.6.10 Contrastive Particles
Either k'i placed after or xolo placed before the item being contrasted
with one preceding will be used, e.g.
me
a+ka v-a+r,
šen
k'i (= xolo Sen) mand
I (NOM) here I-be
you(NOM) but (= but you)
there
'I am here, whereas you (are) there'
3.6.11 Evidential Particle
The Georgian Perfect (= turme+ob+it-i) takes its name from the particle
turme 'evidently, apparently', e.g.
pex+burt-i
football-NOMa+ma+gam
tonightturme
apparentlygvian i-c'q'-eb-a
late
PASS-begin-TSit(PRES)
'the football is apparently beginning late tonight'3.6.12 Habitual Particle
The Georgian Conditional (= xolme+ob+it-i) takes its name from the94GEORGIAN GRAMMARparticle xolme 'as a rule, habitually' (e.g. pex+burt-i rva-ze i-c'q'-eba xolme 'the football begins as a rule at 8').
3.6.13 Approximative Particle
Suffixed to a cardinal (with its Nominative desinence, which thus is fused to
the root) -ode gives the meaning 'round about NUMBER', e.g.
švid+i-ode gogo-s/švid+i-ode-s
7-about
girl-DAT/7-about-DAT
'I see about 7 girls/about 7'v-(0-)xed-av
I -(3rd.PER-)see-TS(PRES)Such forms are treated as vowel-final nouns or adjectives.
3.6.14 Verb-governing Particles
u+nd + a, the modal particle of necessity, is the fossilised form of the
Present tense of the verb 'want' with 3rd person singular subject and
object. For the associated syntax see 5.2.2.3.3.
A similarly fossilised form of this same verb but with 2nd person
singular subject (viz. g+i+nd(+a)) is reduplicated to give the meaning
'whether A or B', e.g.
g+i+nd a + s + e g+i+nd+a i + s+e, sul-ert-i-a
whether like.this or
like.that wholly-one-NOM-is
'it's all the same whether it's like this or like that'
g+i+nd kalak-ái v-i-cxovr-o-t,
g+i+nd+a
whether town-in
lst.PER-SV-live-AOR.SUBJ-PL or
sopel-ši
village-in
'whether we are to live in a town or a village/the country'
g+i+nd i-q'-o-s
da
g+i+nd ara
whether SV-be-AOR.SUBJ-it
and or
not
'whether it be or not'
Used alone this fossil functions as a subordinate conjunction equivalent
to rom-c 'even if', e.g.
g+i+nd m-e-jin-o-s,
even.if
I-IOV-sleep-AOR.SUBJ-Xmainc
stillsul-ši
soul-in'Even if/though I am asleep, you still sit in my soul'm-i-zi-x-a+r
me-OV-sit-yoube(PRES)95NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYNotice how the fossil tends to preserve its basic root's power of
governing a subjunctive verb.
Another fossil, originally a finite verb meaning 'it is possible for X', is
e+g+eb(+i+s)/e+g+eb+a, which has as a synonym the parallel fossil from
the still very much extant verb 'it will be' i+kn+eb(+a). The meaning is
'maybe' and the associated verb is usually, though not necessarily,
subjunctive, e.g.
e+g+eb
(Ø-Ø-)a-job-o-s,
rom a+ma+gam
maybe
(it-it-)LV-be.preferable-AOR.SUBJ-it
that tonight
a+k da-(0-)rč-e
here PREV-(you-)stay-AOR.SUBJ
'maybe it's preferable that tonight you remain here'
Similar to the last two particles is vinjlo, which similarly governs the
Aorist Subjunctive. 11 means 'perhaps' but adds a note of encouragement
for the verbal activity, e.g.
vinjlo ar da-(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-o
č'iatura-c
maybe not PREV-(you-it-)SV-find.distasteful-AOR.SUBJ
Ch'iatura-too
'maybe you won't find Ch'iatura displeasing either (and I hope you
won't)'
vinjlo cocxl-eb-i
da-(Ø-Ø-)i-c""ir-o
maybe alive-PL-NOM
PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)SV-catch-AOR.SUBJ
'maybe you'll catch them alive (and I hope you do/do try to)'
Another verb in origin is lam+i+s 'almost', which has as synonyms
k'inagam or t+i+tk+m+i+s (cf. 5.1.12) or again the full expression cot'aga (Ø-)a-k'l-i-a, rom... 'but little is lacking that...'. It takes the Aorist
Subjunctive, e.g.
tval-eb-ši na+car-s (0-)gv-a-q'r-i-an,
eye-PL-in
ash-DAT (it-)us-LV-throw-TS(PRES)-hey
da-gv-a-brma-o-n
PREV-us-NV-blind-AOR.SUBJ-they
'they hurl ash in our eyes, they almost blind us'lam+i+s
almostIn Old Georgian wishes were expressed by the particle -mc(a). It was
not attached to the verb itself, which was in the indicative mood (usually
Aorist)6. This particle is almost completely lost today, but it does still
occur in the occasional expression, such as c'q'+e+ul-i-mc v-i-q'-o 'may96GEORGIAN GRAMMARI be cursed', where we note the verb is Aorist Subjunctive, which shews
that the particle has lost its original force. Note also the sequence -mc in
two negative phrases: ara+mc da ara+mc ar (= ara + v i t a r
äe+mtxv+ev+a-ši) 'under no circumstances', e.g.
muša-ta
k'las-s

'under no circumstances is it possible for the working class to agree

and ara+mc tu (= k'i ara) 'far from (sc. X happening, Y happened)', e.g.

See 3.7.2.1.5 for the
subordinating conjunction tu+mc(a) 'although'.
vin+i+c+oba+a is an abstract noun in -oba based on the question vin
i-c-i-s? 'who knows?' to which the copula -a 'it is' is suffixed. It is used
in the sense of 'in case, by chance'. It can either be inserted into a
sentence as an adverb, e.g.
tu vin+i+c+oba+a eč'v-i
a-(Ø-)i-g-o-n,

mood, which, though not absolutely excluded after tu, is less common than
the indicative and may thus have been occasioned here by the particle) or
act as a subordinating conjunction in its own rights with the subjunctive,

prefixal passives, particularly in the Prešent, often inherently convey
the concept of potentiality. When they are so used, prescriptive grammar
requires they be negated not by the (now pleonastic) potential ver but by
the unmarked ar, e.g.
gvino
ar (Ø-)e-sm-ev-a
wine(NOM) not (X-)IOV-drink-TS-it
'X cannot drink wine'
though in practice ver is not unknown.5.1.14.3 unmarked
The neutral marker of negation is ar. Two points not already mentioned
need to be stressed about the function of this element. Past statements
which would be expressed by a verb in the Aorist Indicative if positive
switch to the Perfect when negated by ar, e.g.
šen-s
dge-ši ar ša-mo-(Ø-)m-rč-en-i-x-a+r
your-AGR day-in not PREV-PREV-(you-)me-lag.behind-TS-PERFyou-be
brj-ol-a-ši
battle-TS-MASD-in
'In your day you did not fall short of me in battle'
This does not mean that the Aorist Indicative is never found with ar;
this coupling, however, conveys the nuance that the subject had no wish to
carry out the past action and in fact declined to carry it out, e.g.
p'olit'ik'+ur-i mizez-it
ar mi-(Ø-)i-g-es
political-AGR
reason-INST not PREV-(X-)SV-receive-they(AOR)
'For political reasons they refused to accept X'
5.1.15 Commands
As stated in Chapter 4 (4.7.1.2.1), for all verbs apart from the verb of
motion, which has its own special imperative form, the imperative is
formally identical with the 2nd person (singular or plural) of the Aorist572GEORGIANGRAMMARIndicative. 1st person exhortations and 3rd person jussives are expressed
by means of the (Prešent or Aorist) Subjunctive in the appropriate person.
For those verbs which have no Aorist Indicative, commands are expressed
by use of the Prešent Subjunctive in the 2nd person, e.g.
torem, (Ø-Ø-)i-c-od-e,
cocxal-i
ver
otherwise (you-it-)SV-know-IMPERF-SuBJ(PRES) alive-NOM not(POT)
c'a-m-i-x-val! 7
PREV-me-OV-you-go(FuT)
'Otherwise, know that you shall not get away from me alive!'
In the šense of 'only just VERB' the particle ogond (with variants
ogond k'i, ogonda-c) is used with the Imperative (see next section for its
use in wishes), e.g.
ogond ga-mo-(Ø-)di
mand-e+dan,
just
PREV-PREV-(you-)come.out(I MPER) there-from
q'vela+per-i
rig-ze
i-kn-eb-a
everything-NOM order-on
PASS-be-TS-it(FuT)da
and'Only just come out of there, and everything will be in order'
5.1.16 Wishes
The subjunctive (Prešent, Aorist, or sometimes, as an alternative to the
latter, the Future) is used, depending on aspect, sometimes accompanied by
the particles dae and net'av 'would that' (cf. 3.6.7); the old, generally
defunct optative particle -mc(a), which originally accompanied an
indicative verb, is also sometimes found with such subjunctives (cf. 3.6.14).
The IIIrd Subjunctive also occurs in wishes, particularly on formal
occasions, such as in toasts, e.g.
q'vel+gan m+sopl+i+o-ši
everywhere world-inda-mq'ar-eb-ul-i-q'-o-s
PREV-become.firm-TS-P.PTC-SV-beAOR.SuBJ-it(IIIrd.SUBJ)mšvid+oba!
peace(NOM)
'May peace become firmly established everywhere in the world!'
where the Aorist Subjunctive da-mq'ar-d-e-s is also possible. The IIIrd
Subjunctive is also possible in a subordinate clause dependent on a verb of
wishing, e.g.","[589, 590, 591]"
"SYNTAX5655.1.12'almost'
With the adverb k'inagam 'almost' the verb may be either positive or (it is
suggested, as a result of Russian influence) negative, e.g.

5.1.13 Questions
5.1.13.1 Yes-No'
Questions of this type involve no movement of words but are signalled
entirely by the application of the appropriate intonation-pattern, namely a
rišfalling pitch on the final syllable of the verb, which will normally be
the last word in the šentence.
5.1.13.2'Content'
The appropriate interrogative pronoun, adjective or adverb is selected.
The phrase containing this interrogative word is placed immediately before
the verb (or, if prešent, the negative adverb). The intonation is a falling
pitch on the verb's stressed syllable, e.g.","[583, 584]"

The non-finite strategy can be used regardless of the tense of the
introductory verb, as long as the purpose is positive (i.e. non-negative) andSYNTAX577most naturally if the SUBJect of the subordinate verb is co-referential with
either the SUBJect or object of the main verb. The subordinate verb stands
in the Adverbial case of the Future Participle. If the verb is Transitive, its
direct object will surface as an objective Genitive, e.g.
ga-mo-(Ø-)i-q'(+)en-a
lenin-ma e + s k'alam-i

In the following example it is the indirect object of the main verb who
will perform the action of the Future Participle:
maj-eb-i
ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-švir-e
bork'il-eb-is
wrist-Pl-NOM PREV-I -(3rd.PER-X-)OV-extend-AOR
cuff-Pl-GEN

'I held my wrists to X (sc. for X) to put on the handcuffs'
On page 123 of the 1981 second edition of the complete works of D.
K'ldiashvili there is an example where both the notional direct and indirect
objects end up side by side in the Genitive with such a Future Participle
(viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-is tav-is da-sa-g+c'-ev-ad deaf-ADV beingGEN head-GEN PREV-FuT.PTC-avoid-TS-ADV
'to avoid being deaf).
However, quoting this very example KEGl put the indirect object into a
postpositional phrase (viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-isa-gan tav-is da-sa-g+c'e v a d ) — i s the 1981 edition defective, or is the double Genitive a
legitimate treatment paralleling the example quoted in 5.1.5 (namely:

the indirect object is seen in: k'oncert'-ze da-sa-sc'r-eb-ad č a - m o vid-a 'X came to attend the concert' (cf. k'oncert'-s da-(Ø-)e-sc'r-o 'X

vepx+is+t'q'a+osn-is k'val-is mi-sa-gn-eb-ad 'in order to locate the
track of The Man in the Panther's Skin' (cf. k'val-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-o 'X

An alternative non-finite strategy that makes the Genitive of the
Masdar dependent on m i z n - i t , the Instrumental of m i z a n - i 'aim', is
condemned by purists as a calque on the Russian construction s cel'ju (+
Gen) 'with the aim of...'. However, if one allows it, the relevant section of
the example 'lenin used this pen to write that letter' would be m a g

5.2.2.1.2 Result
The main clause contains an appropriate correlative (e.g. the equivalent of
'so', 'such a', 'to such an extent', 'so many', etc.), and the following
subordinate clause will begin with the conjunction rom 'that' in combination

'He died in youth. And so (The result was that) he could not realise our

Esšentially the same construction as IIIustrated above for the basic
clause of result is employed as equivalent for English structures of the
form 'without V-ing', wherein the subordinate clause will of course contain
a negative, e.g.

Note how the ordering of correlative and subordinate clause can invert,
and how then the clitic r o m avoids c l a u š i n i t i a l position: i + s
mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme, bilet-s rom ar (Ø-)q'id(+)ulob-s, i+s+e.
Where the verb has a Privative Participle, it is often possible to
produce an alternative non-finite expression for the meaning 'without

direct object of a transitive participle going into the Genitive, e.g.

5.2.2.1.3 Cause
A range of conjunctions exists to mark causal clauses. Of those that
specifically indicate a reason the most colloquial is ra(+)k'i, the least
colloquial is vina+i+dan, whilst ra+d+gan(a+c) holds a middle position.
The mood of the verb will be indicative, and the ordering of main vs

The language distinguishes not only in the basic negative particles but also
in all parts of speech (pronouns, adverbs, adjectives) that may be derived
therefrom the three types of negation: (a) simple ('X does not VERB'), (b)
potential ('X cannot VERB'), (c) prohibition ('Do not VERB!').
Verbs
Structurally aGEORGIANverb may incorporate such elements (morphemes)
as the following:
(1) Preverb(s) - (2) Agreement Prefix - (3) Version Vowel - (4) ROOT - (5)
Causative Suffix(es) - (6) Passive Formant [-d-j - (7) Thematic Suffix - (8)
Perfect/Stative Marker - (9) Past Marker [-(o)d-j - (1Ø) Tense/Mood Vowel
- (11) Agreement Suffix/Pluraliser
Preverbs originally indicated direction, a function they retain with
verbs of motion, but today they largely serve to denote perfective aspect
(i.e. the carrying of a verbal activity through to its conclusion) and tend to
occur everywhere outside the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. Prešent Indicative,
Imperfect Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive) with Transitive and Intransitive
verbs.
Verbs can agree not only with their subject (as is the norm for the
Indo-European language-family) but with both direct and indirect objects.
Agreement is achieved by means of items (2) and (11) from the above-list.
There are two sets of agreement-affixes.

between affixal group and cašmarking, three patterns exist, as depicted

subscript 'A' and the 'object'-affixes by subscript 'B':

classified in terms of Transitives, Intransitives, Medials, and Indirect Verbs
(plus the marginal Statives). This enables us to tabulate the distribution of
the above three patterns for these four/five verb-types as follows-.","[544, 545, 546]"
"SYNTAX591where either the SUBJect-pronoun šen or the locative adverb a+k are
suitable insertions to protect the clitic rom from claušinitial position. The
non-finite method of expressing the basic temporal notion is to use the
Masdar of the subordinate verb. It stands in the Genitive case, being
dependent upon dro-s, Dative of the noun dro 'time', e.g.
tv+it+m+pr+in+av-ši š s v l - i s

The Masdar plus dro-s may be fused to produce the Dative of the
Genitive base within the Masdar alone (i.e. š s v l - i s a - s ) .
5.2.2.1.7.2 'as soon as'
Two finite reprešentations exist. The first places the words ro+gor+c k'i
'as soon as' at the start of the indicative subordinate clause, which may
either precede or follow the main clause, e.g.
ro+gor+c k'i
šen-i
c'er+il-i

c'a-v-(Ø-)i-k'itx-av
it-DAT PREV-I -(it-)SV-read-TS(FuT)
'As soon as your letter reaches me, I shall read it'
The second strategy is based on the formation of alternative questions
and places the words tu ara 'or not' immediately after the subordinate
verb; a peculiarity of this strategy is that the subordinate clause must
precede the main clause, so that the first clause in the last example may be
recast to give either:
šen-i c'er+il-i mo-m-i-va tu ara,...
or mo-m-i-va tu ara šen-i c'er+il-i,...
The non-finite alternative consists of the postposition -tana+ve 'at the
very moment' governing the Genitive of the Masdar of the subordinate
verb, so that a further variant of the first clause above would be:592GEORGIANGRAMMARšen-i

The allied notion of 'since + Past Tense Verb' is conveyed by the same
construction, though the postposition še+m+deg may be replaced by
uk'an 'behind' or by a+k+et 'on this side, over here', whilst the first two
words of the pseudo-conjunctional complex may yield to the phrase i+m
dro-i+dan 'from that time', e.g.

'Since the time you left me 1 have been going around like a ghost'
The English concatenation of 'since' with the Progressive Perfect is
rendered simply by the use of ra+c, which is optionally omissible, with the

Where the action of the subordinate verb is one that is amenable to

5.2.2.l7A 'while, until, before'
These concepts are conveyed by a choice between the two conjunctions
sa+na+m(de) and vi+d+re(+mde) (older variants being sa+na+mdis/
vi+d+re+mdis), both of which roughly mean 'upto where/which point', such
that the different temporal notions are reflected in the varying syntax of
the clauses themselves.
5.2.2.1.7.4.1 'while'
If the verb is of continuous aspect, the šense must be that of 'while', e.g.

5.22.1.7.4.2'until'
The prešence of a negative in the main clause motivates the introduction
of one in the subordinate clause too, e.g.

Here both clauses contain the Future Indicative. If the main clause is
a prohibition, the subordinate clause may contain the negated Future
Indicative, Aorist Indicative, Aorist SUBJunctive or even the Perfect, e.g.","[609, 610, 611, 612]"

This same strategy can be used to indicate a cause within a mainsubordinate clausal sequence, e.g.

m-e-mukr-eb-a
me-IOV-threaten-TS-he
'I am afraid of the enemy because (= for the reason that) he threatens
me with death'
If i+m+it'om is followed by the emphatic particle k'i 'indeed' and the
accompanying verb is negated, the šentence is to be interpreted as one in
which the negative negates not the main verb but rather the reason
offered. And so, faced with the sequence mt'r-isa i+m+it'om k'i ar mr
e-šin-i-a, rom si+k'vd+il-it m-e-mukr-eb-a, the implication is that
there is a more compelling reason than his mere threats for me to fear the
enemy, such that the šentence could be continued with some such addition
as:

The general subordinator rom alone can be used, especially in speech,
to mark a causal clause, though out of context the clause could also be
interpreted as one of time. The ordering of main vs subordinate clause is
immaterial, though the subordinator avoids claušinitial position, e.g.

5.2.2.1.4 Conditional
The regular distinction between real (or vivid, or immediate, or open) and
unreal (or vague, or remote, or closed) conditions can be drawn. They are
distinguished both by the conjunction in the protasis (viz. tu 'if' for the
former vs r o m 'if' for the latter) and by the screeves that can be
associated with these conjunctions.
5.2.2.1.4.1 Real Conditionals
The conjunction tu 'if' usually occupies the first position in the protasis,
although it may also stand after the clause's first constituent. The
appropriate non-SUBJunctive screeve is used in both protasis and apodosis,
and the order of main vs subordinate clause is free, e.g.
tu kux-s,
a+g+re+t+ve
el(+)av-s
if
thunder(PRES)i-t also

'If it is thundering, it is also lightening'

if (?it-)SV-thunder-TS(FuT)-it also
(?it-)SV-lightenTS(FuT)-it
'If it thunders, it will also lighten'
A peculiarity of real future conditions is that the protasis may contain
not the anticipated Future Indicative but the Aorist Indicative, so that an
alternative to the above would be:
tu (?Ø-)i-kux-a,
a+g+re+t+ve
(?Ø-)i-el(+)v-eb-s

unexpectedly, tu may combine with the SUBJunctive mood. This
combination does not produce an unreal condition but rather conveys the
force of 'if it transpires that...' and is often found associated with oaths
when the speaker is asserting his honesty. The Prešent SUBJunctive is used
for progressive activities in the prešent, the Aorist SUBJunctive for future
events, and the IIIrd SUBJunctive for reference to the past, e.g.

"NON-VERBALMORPHOLOGY63However, it is also found with the plural sense of 'their own', for which the
form tav-ian-t-i exists. A parallel is produced by sxva 'other', from the
Genitive of which is derived sxv-is-i (plural sxv-eb-is-i), which forms
are usually used substantivally in the sense of 'that of another/others'.
The interrogative pronouns vin? 'who?' and ra? 'what?' form the
interrogative possessives v-is-i? 'whose (human)?' and r-is-i? 'whose
(non-human)?' from their Genitives.
All the above behave as normal consonant-final adjectives in terms of
how they agree with their head-nouns and thus need not be illustrated.
3.2.6 Interrogative (k'itx+v+it-i) (Relative (mi+mart+eb+it-i)) Adjectives
The main interrogative adjectives are ra? 'what?', which is only used with
non-human nouns (e.g. ra cxen-i/c'ign-i? what
horse-NOm/book-NOm
'what horse/book?'), though when used in exclamations it is not so
restricted (e.g. ra k'ac-i x-a+r! what.a man-NOm you-be(PRES) 'what a
man you are!'), and romel-i? 'which?', which is used with humans and nonhumans alike (e.g. romel k'ac-s/cxen-s? which man-DAT/horse-DAT
'to
which man/horse?'). In relative clauses with coreferential noun undeleted
for reasons of emphasis both these forms may appear, the noun carrying
the relative marker -c. Whether in interrogative or relative function ra
behaves like any vowel-stem adjective, whilst romel-i behaves like any
consonant-stem adjective.
Other interrogative adjectives are: ro+gor-i? = ra+gvar-i? =
ra+rig-i? = ra+nair-i? 'what kind of?', ro+d+i-ndel-i? 'of what time?',
sada-ur-i? 'of what place?', ra+m+oden+a? = ra+m+xel+a? 'of what
size/amount?', ra+m+den-i? = ra+o+den-i? 'how many?', ra+m+den+
nair-i? = ra+m+den+gvar-i? 'of how many types?'.
3.2.7 Indefinite (gan+u+sa+zgv+r+el+ob+it-i) Adjectives
The two indefinite suffixes are -me, used for non-specific indefinites (i.e.
where the identity is quite unknown), and -ga+c(a), used (more often
without the bracketed -a) for specific indefinites. Adding them to romel-i
we produce romel-i-me 'any (at all)' vs romel-i-ga+c(a) 'some'. The
latter may only be treated as an indivisible whole, which produces the
following declensional patterning for the phrase 'a certain woman':

non-human, the equivalent ra-ga+c(a) could just as easily replace romeli-ga+c(a) (e.g. romel-i-ga+c(a)/ra-ga+c(a) ambav-i 'some business').
The same unchanging pattern is also normal for the non-specific
indefinite, though the Genitive and Instrumental permit an old alternative,
where the suffix is added to the adjective in agreement with its head, as in
the phrase 'any woman':

The three basic negatives ar(a) 'not', ver(a) 'not (potential)' and nu 'not

3.3. Adverbs(zmn+isa+rt-eb-i)3.3.1 Adverbs from Adjectives
To form the adverb from an adjective, the adjective is simply given the
ending of the Adverbial case (e.g. lamaz-i 'beautiful' => l a m a z - a d
'beautifully'; mc'are 'bitter' => mc'are-d 'bitterly'; sa+oc+ar-i 'amazing' =>
sa + o c + r - a d 'amazingly'; sa + u c x o + o 'wonderful' => sa + u c x o + o-d
'wonderfully'; mšven+ier-i 'marvellous' => mšven+ivr-ad 'marvellously',
where we note the alteration in the suffix; met'-i 'more' => met'-ad 'to a
greater extent'; na+k'1+eb-i 'fewer' => na+k'l+eb-ad/na+k'l+eb 'less, to
a lesser extent'; sa-u-k'et-es-o 'best' => sa-u-k'et-es-o-d 'in the best
way, for the best').
In some instances the final dental component of the Adverbial ending is
lost (e.g. čkar-i 'quick' => čkar-a 'quickly'; nel-i 'slow' => nel-a 'slowly';
maġal-i 'high, tall' => maġl-a 'on high, high up'; dabal-i 'low' => dabl-a
'low down').
Future Participles (4.9.3) in the Adverbial case have a special syntactic
function which is explained in 5.2.1.1.
Privative Participles (4.9.4) are also common in the Adverbial case—see
5.2.2.1.2 for the syntax of expressions of the type 'without VERBing'. Quite
frequently in such cases an alternative formation is used. Alongside such
regular forms for verbs in Thematic Suffix -eb- as: ga-u-tav-eb-1-ad
'unendingly'; da-u-jin-eb-1-ad 'without sleeping'; da-u-sven-eb-1-ad
'without resting', u-k'l-eb-l-ad 'without exception' e t c . , one still comes66GEORGIANGRAmmARacross wholly synonymous variants in -iv, which admittedly are less
common today than they once were, such as respectively: ga-u-tav-eb-1iv, da-u-jin-eb-1-iv, da-u-sven-eb-1-iv, u-k'l-eb-l-iv 2
It is not only Privative Participles which manifest this seemingly
Adverbial variant-ending—alongside sxva+per/sxva+p(e)r-ad 'differ­
ently' there is sxva+pr-iv (as well as the pleonastically marked sxva+priv-ad); alongside the opaque mudam 'permanently' there is mudm-iv, on
which are based m u d m - i v - i 'permanent', m u d m - i v - m o k m e d - i
'permanently active' and mudm-iv-oba 'permanence'. It seems to be a
constituent of irgvl+iv 'all around' and si+grj+iv/gasc'vr+iv 'alongside'.
We have mxr-iv 'from the side', marjvn-iv 'to the right' and marcxn-iv
'to the left'. Note also the adjective masobriv-i 'mass-', which produces
the adverb masobriv-ad 'massively, with large numbers'. Very common is
čv+e+ul+ebr-iv 'usually' => čv+e+ul+ebr-iv-i 'usual'.
3.3.1.1 Comparative and Superlative Grades
These are produced from the positive grade in exactly the same way as for
the comparison of adjectives. Analytically the comparative places u+pr+o
before the positive form, whilst the superlative requires the presence of
q'vela-ze 'than all' with or without u + pr + o (e.g. u+pr+o k'arg-ad
'better' vs q'vela-ze (u+pr+o) k'arg-ad 'best'). For synthetic formations,
the Adverbial case of the form in u- -es-i is used (e.g. u-a+r-es-ad
'worse' vs q'vela-ze u-a+r-es-ad/cud-ad 'worst').
3.3.2 Adverbs Not Derived From Adjectives
Sometimes an expression standing in theNOMINATIVEcase functions
adverbially, as in expressions of time mtel-i k'vira '(for) the whole week',
sam-i tve '(for) three months', dge da game 'day and night', mudam dge
= q'ovel dge 'every day'—cf. dg-it-i dge 'from day to day'.
The Dative case also provides a number of adverbs (e.g. dge-s 'today'
<= dge 'day'; c'el-s (= c'1+eul-s) 'this year' <= c'el-i 'year'; šor-s 'far
away'; did xan-s '(for) a long time'; axlo-s 'nearby'; a+k+et+oba-s 'on
the way here', for which the Genitive-Dative combined ending seen in
a+k+et+ob-isa-s is also possible; i+k + it+oba-s/i+k+it+ob-isa-s 'on
the way there'). Irregular Datives in -as are shewn by a+dg+il-i 'place'
and p'ir-i 'face' when they are used to express a location (e.g. a + m
a+dg+il-as 'at this place'; ga+nadgur+eb-is p'ir-as 'on the edge of
extinction')—cf. also a+m c'ut-as 'this minute'.
The Instrumental too provides a number of adverbs (e.g. marjvn-it 'to
the right'; marcxn-it 'to the left'; švid-i c'l-it 'for 7 years'; dg-it 'byNON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY67day', which also exists in the Genitive-Instrumental combination dg-is-it,
cf. dg-it da gam-it = dg-is-it da gam-it 'day and night', cf. dg-is-it
da mz-is-it 'in the light of day', where mze = 'sun'; or+šabat+ob-it 'on
mondays'; ze-v-it 'up/upstairs'; kve-v-it 'down/downstairs'; sa-it?
'whither?'; neb+s-it 'voluntarily' vs u+neb+1+i+e-t 'involuntarily'; ara-sgz-it 'in no way' vs vera-s-gz-it 'in no way (potential)' vs nura-s-gz-it
'in no way (prohibitional)').
Some adverbs contain postpositions (e.g. q'ovel-tvis 'always, forever',
which has -tvis 'for'; q'vel-gan 'everywhere', sxva-gan 'elsewhere',
zog-gan 'in some places' and bevr-gan 'in many places' have -gan 'from';
gušin-c'in 'the day before yesterday'; sa-it-k'en? 'whither?'; sa-i+dan?
'whence?'; ro+de-mde? 'till when?').
multiplicatives are formed by adding -ǰer to the root of a cardinal,
though in the case of ert-i '1' the suffix -xel is more usual (e.g. ertxel/ert-ǰer 'once', or-ǰer 'twice', at-ǰer '10-times', as or-m-oc-da-txut-met'-ǰer '155-times'); -xel is not absolutely excluded from cardinals
other than '1', and the suffix -gzis is also found in parallel with -ǰer (e.g.
ert-gzis 'once', mraval-ǰer/mraval-gzis 'several times').

ro+gor? 'how?', j a l + i a n / j l + i e r 'very', jl + iv + s 'with difficulty',

"282.3GEORGI AN GRAMMARRoot-structureTypical roots consist of a single consonant or consonant-cluster (e.g. - k ­
in k-eb-a 'praise/praising', -k'vd- in k'vd-om-a 'dying' or si-k'vd-il-i
'death'), consonant(-cluster) plus vowel (e.g. ru 'stream', gru 'hole'), vowel
plus consonant(-cluster) (e.g. av-i 'evil, bad, poorly', ert-i T), consonant(cluster) plus vowel plus consonant(-cluster) (e.g. mal-av 'you hide X/them',
q'lap'-av 'you swallow X/them', k'arg-av 'you lose X/them', xvanǰ-av =
xlart-av 'you entangle/entwine X/them'). Polysyllabic roots also occur
(e.g. k'ata 'cat', iol-i 'easy', a-k'varaxč'in-eb 'you cunningly manage
X/them'), reduplication often (though not exclusively) occurring with words
depicting sounds (e.g. xar=xar-i 'belly-laughter', xit=xit-i 'giggle',
but'=but'-eb 'you mumble', lug=lug-eb 'you slur your speech')
reduplications often alter the second component slightly (e.g. abda=ubda
'nonsense', ogro=čogro 'bumpy', gac'a=mac'ia-ši v-a+r 'I am run off my
feet (= in a state of having much to do at once)'). Other than in derived
forms, it is very rare for a verbal root either to begin or end in a vowel; a
handful of verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb do, however, end in -i (e.g. moi-xs(+)eni-eb 'you will mention X/them', mo-i-ger(i)-eb 'you will ward
off X/them', mo-i-šveli-eb 'you will use X/them as an aid', mo-i-nani-eb
'you will repent X/them'2).
2.4Suprasegmentals2.4.1 Stress
Stress is weak and, possibly for this reason, its placement has proved
somewhat difficult to specify. Writing in 1904 Adolf Dirr gave the
following description: 'Der Akzent ist im Georgischen ein Längenakzent; die
Stimme steigt nicht wie im Deutschen oder Russischen... Die Betonung fällt:
1. in zwei- und dreisilbigen Wörtern auf die erste Silbe; 2. in mehrsilbigen
auf die drittletzte. Diese Regeln bleiben auch dann giltig, wenn das Wort
durch Deklination oder Konjugation verlängert wird. Zusammengesetzte
Wörter haben den Hauptton auf dem ersten Element, das zweite bekommt
einen Nebenton. Uebrigens wird der Akzent schwächer markiert als im
Deutschen und die gewöhnliche Konversationssprache geht oft über die
Akzentregeln hinweg' (pp.3-4). Tschenkéli (1958.LX) says: 'a. In Wörtern
mit zwei oder drei Silben wird die erste Silbe betont...; b. Für Wörter mit
mehr als drei Silben ist es kaum möglich, feste Regeln aufzustellen. Es lässt
sich nur im allgemeinen sagen, dass in vier- und mehrsilbigen Wörtern
gewöhnlich die erste Silbe betont wird, nie dagegen die letzte. Die29SOUND SYSTEMdrittletzte Silbe bekommt oft den Nebenton...; c. Besonders in
zusammengesetzten Wörtern trägt der erste Teil den Ton. Wenn
gelegentlich auch der zweite Teil betont wird, so geschieht dies sekundär.
Der Hauptton liegt, besonders wenn es sich um Präfixe handelt, immer auf
dem ersten Teil, d.h. auf dem Präfix'.
Even in tri-syllabic surnames ending in -Je 'son' (older 'heir') stress falls
on the penultimate syllable (e.g. ševardnáje), just as it tends to fall on the
same penultimate for surnames ending in the other common formant—
šv+il-i 'child' (e.g. kartvelišvlli), though for tri-syllabics in general it is
true that the ante-penultimate syllable takes the stress. For words of more
than three syllables, we can say that the stress will predominantly fall on
the ante-penultimate (e.g. me-or-m-oc-da-t-ékvs-met'-e '56th'), though
in some cases preference will be for the first syllable to carry it (e.g.
mêgobar-i 'friend').
Since the stressed syllable is so relatively weakly distinguished from
other syllables in the word, there is nothing like the vowel-weakening in
unstressed syllables that is so characteristic of languages like Russian,
though perhaps the origin of syncope is to be sought in an older stage of
the language where stress might have been more prominent.
2.4.2 Pitch
Questions containing a question-word place a high-fall on the verb's
stressed syllable, e.g.
a+s + e adre ra+t'om mV(Ø 3 -)di-x-a+r
so
early why
PREV-(you-)go-you-be(PRES)
'Why are you going to town so early?'
e+s
vin
ga-(Ø-)à-k'et-a?
this(NOM) who(ERG) PREV-(it-)NV-do-X(AOR)
'Who did this?'kalak-ši?
town-toIf the answer is not heard and the essential components of the question
are repeated, the question-word has a high-fall, whilst the final syllable of
the accompanying verb carries a rise (ràt'om mi-(Ø-)di-x-á+r? 'Why are
you going (sc. did you say)?', vin ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-á? 'Who did it (sc. did you
say)'). If an interruption is made using an interrogative only, then that
interrogative carries high-falling pitch (A: london-ši mi-v-di-v-a+r. B:
sàd(a)? 'A: I am going to London. B: Where?'). Yes-no questions take a
rise-fall on the final syllable of the verb, which will regularly be the final
word of the sentence—the presence of this pitch causes a concomitant30GEORGI AN GRAMMARlengthening of the vowel on which it falls (e.g. mi-(0-)di-x-a+r? =
[midixáàr] 'Are you going?'). Tag-questions are characterised by a highfalling pitch on the verb's stressed syllable (e.g. xom mV(0-)di-x-a+r?
'You are going, aren't you?', xom ar rni-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'You aren't going,
are you?'). Alternative questions have high-falling pitch on the negative
element in the second part of the question (e.g. mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu ara?
= mi-(0-)di-x-a+r tu àr mi-(0-)di-x-a+r? 'Are you going or not
(going)?').
2.5 Sound-symbolism
Holisky (1981.122-125) and at greater length Holisky and Kaxadze
(1986.184-207) draw attention to some verb-sets indicating the production
of types of sound where a particular nuance is introduced either by
retaining the place of articulation of a consonant(-cluster) whilst altering
the manner of articulation or by alteration to the vowels within the root.
Examples:
i. The set depicts loud, irritating crying of children, ugly and openmouthed:
ǰgav-i-s indicates the loudest, lowest (not piercing) sound-production
vsčxav-i-s which stands between the former and the following, being
piercing and coarser than the following vs
č'q'av-1-s which is highest, piercing and sharp
ii. The two depict quiet, indistinct grumbling in an irritated, unhappy tone
of voice, usually implying discontent:
burdgun-eb-s is the lower, more prolonged, continuous sound vs
burt'q'un-eb-s which is higher with less talking, perhaps more sudden,
as when blurting something out
iii. The two depict sobbing, usually of children or very young teenagers:
zlukun-eb-s is the lower, louder, stronger, more involved vs
sluk'un-eb-s which is higher and softer
For the effect stemming from a change of vowel we take:

Where the negated Perfect is required in the main clause, the negated

If these two clauses were together made dependent upon a past tense
introductory verb of command, such that the resulting structure
reprešented indirect speech, the temporal clause would have to contain the

Where the temporal šense is indisputably 'before' (i.e. when the main verb
is positive and of non-durative aspect), a non-past verb in the main clause
is accompanied by the Future SUBJunctive in the subordinate clause (though
the Future Indicative is also feasible when reference is to a specific
event), whilst a past tense main verb is partnered by the Conditional in the
dependent clause (though the Aorist Indicative is possible when there is no
long gap between the main and subordinate events), e.g.

where the negated Aorist SUBJunctive of the subordinate clause is
preferably substituted by the negated Future Indicative (viz. k'ac-i gul-s
ar da-(Ø-)i-jer-eb-s).
As far as non-finite reprešentations are concerned, again the notions
'until' and 'before' merge in the use of the postposition -mde (older -mdis)
governing the Adverbial case of the Masdar, e.g.

5.2.2.1.7.4 Surrogate for the participle as claušsubstitute
None ofGEORGIAN'sparticiples may be used as substitute for subordinate
clauses in the manner of English 'Having washed the dishes, she sat down',
'He is sitting there reading a book'. However, by inserting ra within a
clause with its own finite verb, one achieves a similar effect to the use of
such participles in English, e.g.

5.2.2.2 Adjectival (Relative) Clauses
5.2.22.1 Construction with full relative pronoun and preposed head
For a full discussion see Hewitt (1985, and 1987 chapter 8); Aronson (1975)
also looks at relative clauses.
When the relative pronouns vin-c 'who', ra-c 'which', romel-i-c 'who,
which' are used, they stand first in the clause (or as part of the first
constituent) and take the case appropriate to their function within the
subordinate clause. The first two do not require the prešence of a head,
e.g.
vin-c
who(NOM)-RElšmo-vid-a,
PREV-PREV-enter-he(AOR)ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-marj-o-s
PREV-[?it-him-)OVwelcome-AOR.SUBJ-X(?God)'Welcome to (the one) who has entered!'
Where a head is prešent, if it consists of a full lexical noun, then the
third pronoun will be more likely to be used, e.g.
avt'or-i,
ro+ml-is
c'ign-s(a-c)
author-NOM who-GEN
book-DAT(-REl)
'the author whose book they are burning...'(Ø-)c'v-av-en,..
(them-)burn-TS-they6Ø1SYNTAXWhere the head-constituent consists of just a demonstrative pronoun or
such non-specific elements as q'vela 'all', q'vela+per-i 'everything' etc.,
then either vin-c or ra-c will be used, e.g.
i+s,
ra-c
that(NOM) which(NOM)-REl
'What you have is no good'
q'vela,
vin-c
all(NOM) who(NOM)-RElg-a-kv-s,

'Everyone who follows nationalism will betray his country'There is no strict adherence to-number-agreement between head and
relative pronoun; a formally plural head may be followed by a singular
pronoun, whose verb may then be either singular or plural, whilst a
formally singular but semantically plural head may be construed with a
plural form of romel-i-c, e.g.

in OldGEORGIAN(and instances of the reverse assimilation also are attested
there); an example in ModernGEORGIANfrom literary Georgia (13 July
199Ø) would be:6Ø2GEORGIANGRAMMARnu+tu (Ø-)pikr-ob-s, rom, ra-sa-c

PREV-(it-)write-X(FuT)
'Does X really think that he'll write what he wants?'
which in theory should be: ...rom i+ma-s, ra-c u-nd-a, da-(Ø-)c'er-s.
The general subordinator rom is sometimes found in association with
either ra-c or vin-c, as in this 18th century example from the poet
Guramishvili (quoted form Ertelishvili 1963.7Ø):
vin-c

'let whoever takes exception to being censured do nothing to cause
censure'
For purposes of emphasis the co-referential NP inside the subordinate
clause may be retained alongside the head-noun in the main clause. In
such cases the co-referential NP will be accompanied by romel-i (or ra)
in adjectival function, the relative particle -c attaching to the coreferential NP, e.g.
i+s
saxl-i,
ra//romel saxl-ši((d)a-)c

'the place whither' (adgil-i, sa+it-k'ena-c), 'the place whence' (adgil-i,
sa+i+dana-c), 'the time when' (dro, roca/r(+)o+de+sa-c), 'the reason
why' (mizez-i, ra+t'om(a-c)) are, of course, perfectly acceptable.
In an expression such as 'If you take that money, (an act) which I do
not advise, you will be punished', where the inserted clause refers not to a
specific head but rather to the whole conditional clause,GEORGIANwould
use ra-c and not romel-i-c, e.g6Ø3SYNTAX

"2GEORGI AN GRAMMARTable 1: Family-tree of the Kartvelian LanguagesWithin Georgia itself, as indicated on the accompanying map, Svan is
spoken in the high mountain-valleys of the rivers Enguri and Cxenis-c'q'ali
in the north-western region of Svaneti(a), east of Abxazia. Mingrelian is
located in Mingrelia, the lowland area of West Georgia that is bounded by
Abxazia, Svaneti(a), Imereti and Guria. As for Georgian, its many and
diverse dialects are: Ač'aran, Gurian, Imeretian in the west, Lečxumian,
Rač'an in the north-west, Mtiulur-Gudamaq'rulian, Moxevian in the north,
Xevsurian, Pshavian and Tush in the north-east, K'ax(et)ian in the east,
Mesxian, Dzhavaxian in the south(-west), and Kartlian in the centre. The
literary dialect, which is described below, is based on the speech of the
province of Kartli, in which the capital Tbilisi is situated.
It might be appropriate to observe at this point that, although the
Georgians on the whole profess (Orthodox) Christianity, as a result of
Turkish influence the natives of Ač'ara adopted Islam. The interplay of
religion and ethnicity is also relevant with regard to the S.W. province of
Mesxeti. On 15th November 1944 144,000 (according to the figure most
regularly quoted) residents of the area and adherents of Islam were exiled
to Soviet Central Asia, a fate that was suffered by a number of Soviet
peoples around the time of World War 11 (Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans,
and from the N. Caucasus Balkars, Karachays, Chechens and Ingush).
Though acknowledged under Khrushchëv to have been guilty of no crimes
(such as treason), these Mesx(et)ians have not yet secured permission to
return to their homeland, principally because of opposition from the
government of Georgia, and many had to be hurriedly evacuated from
Uzbekistan following the inter-ethnic conflict that flared up in the
Ferghana Valley in 1989. These people are usually referred to as
«Mesx(et)ian Turks», and it has been suggested that they were removed
from the border-area because of their pro-Turkish sympathies in advanceINTRODUCTION3of a possible Soviet incursion into Turkey. The precise ethnic allegiance
of the possibly 300,000 who wish to return to Georgia is a matter of
dispute: are they turkified Georgians or ethnic Turks, descended from
those who settled in an area regarded by Georgians as primaeval Georgian
land when it became the border between Georgia and Ottoman Turkey?
The arguments put forward in support of Georgia's refusal to allow their
resettlement are that: (a) the region has been repopulated, (b) there is no
room elsewhere in Georgia either, (c) Christian Georgians have always
been, and still are being, threatened by adherents of Islam*, so that to
accept the influx of so many muslims, especially along their border with
Turkey, would be to invite trouble. The most that has been offered is
resettlement somewhere within Georgia of those who (a) vow allegiance to
Georgia, (b) know, or will learn, Georgian, (c) have, or will adopt, Georgian
surnames, and (d) convert to Christianity.
1.1 The Languages of the Caucasus
The Caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the multiplicity of
languages spoken there. In the 10th century the Arab al-Mas'udi named it
«the mountain of tongues» (Catford 1977). A variety of language-families
are represented there, such as Indo-European (Ossetic, Armenian, Russian)
and Turkic (Azeri, Kumyx), but apart from these there are at least three,
possibly four, autochthonous families. In addition to Kartvelian the others
are: North West Caucasian (Abxaz-Abaza, Circassian, Ubyx), North Central
Caucasian (Chechen, Ingush, Bats), North East Caucasian (Avar, Andi,
Botlix, Ghodoberi, K'arat'a, Axvax, Bagval, T'indi, C'amalal, Dido, Xvarsh,
Hinux, Bezhti, Hunzib, Lak', Dargwa, Lezgi(an), Tabassaran, Arči, Aghul,
Rutul, Ts'axur, Budux, Xinalugh, Udi, K'ryts'. North Central and North East
Caucasian are treated by most as a single family. In fact, all the northern
families may be genetically related. From the above-list Abxaz and Bats
are spoken not in the geographical north Caucasus but within the republic
of Georgia (cf. §1.6 below).
All these indigenous languages are characterised by the presence of an
ejective series of consonants, and all apart from modern Mingrelian have
normally been accepted as manifesting to a greater or lesser degree the
phenomenon of ergativity, though this issue with respect to Georgian
continues to foster much lively debate (see Hewitt 1983, 1987a, 1989 and
1995 for the details). If North West Caucasian as a family can be thought
of as being marked by large consonantal inventories with correspondingly
minimal vowel-systems and also by polysynthetic verb-forms with
correspondingly simple morphology within the nominal system, elsewhere in4GEORGIAN GRAMMARthe north Caucasus one tends to find complex vowel-systems and rich
morphology for the noun, balanced by relatively straightforward verbs.
Kartvelian occupies a middle position by virtue of having (a) a reasonable
proportion of consonants to vowels (even if, as shewn later, there is a
surprising tolerance of consonant-complexes), and (b) a comparative
complexity within both nominal and verbal morphology.
1.2 The Georgian Scripts
Georgian is unique amongst not only the Kartvelian languages but also the
38 or so autochthonous languages of the Caucasus as a whole in possessing
an unbroken literary tradition of some 15 centuries; though some attempts
were made in the 19th century to establish scripts for other indigenous
languages in the region, those that today have literary status in the former
USSR really only gained this in any meaningful sense following the
establishment of Soviet power. Two legends are associated with the
creation of the Georgian script—(a) that it was devised by King Parnavaz
in the 4th/3rd centuries B.C., (b) that Armenian Bishop Mesrop Mashtots
invented it c.400 A.D. along with the Armenian script and that of the «lost»
Caucasian Albanians. Most, however, would concur that it was probably
created some time in the 4th century (Ts'ereteli 1960), on the model of
contemporary Greek (Gamq'relidze 1989), in order to facilitate the spread
of Christianity, introduced in the 330s. The earliest inscription dates from
C.430 at the Georgian church founded by Peter the Iberian in the Judaean
desert near Bethlehem; within Georgia the oldest inscription hails from 494
at the Bolnisi Sion (60 kilometres to the south from Tbilisi).
During its history Georgian has had three scripts, all written from left
to right and lacking the distinction between upper and lower cases: (a) from
the 5th to the 9th century mrg(v)lovani
'rounded' (otherwise called
asomtavruli
'majiscule') was used; (b) from this developed
k'utxovani
'angular' (or nusxuri 'miniscule'), which, having made its first appearance in
the testament appended to the Sinai Polycephalon of 864, continued to be
used for most manuscripts written in the 10th/11th centuries—within such
manuscripts the earlier script was employed in the function of capitals; (c)
the modern mxedruli 'military, secular' script evolved from its predecessor
in the 11th century. However, the Church continued to use the older scripts
for sacred texts, such that the generic term xucuri 'ecclesiastical' came to
be adopted jointly to distinguish them from their mutual descendant. The
modern script has 33 characters and is fully phonemic; Old Georgian used
5 additional characters, which are bracketed in their mxedruli-forms in the
table that follows:INTRODUCTION5Table 2: The Three Scripts of Georgian

1.3 The History of Georgian Philology
The earliest known work in Georgian to deal with philological issues in the
language, namely A Treatise on Articles, was discovered by Mzekala
Shanidze (1984) as part of the 11th-12th century manuscript No.6 from the
collection of the I veron Monastery on Mt. Athos, a work she tentatively
attributes to the scholar Eprem Mtsire. Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725)
produced the first native dictionary in 1716, whilst the first grammar of the6GEORGI AN GRAMMARlanguage written in Georgian belongs to Zurab Shanshovani (1737), followed
in 1753 and 1767 by versions of a more comprehensive description by
Patriarch Ant'on I (1720-1788). A number of grammatical works appeared
through the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was essentially in the
writings of T h e Father of Modern Georgian Philology', Ak'ak'i Shanidze
(February 1887-March 1987), that Georgian grammar finally came of age.
His monumental Fundamentals of the Georgian Language, most recently re­
printed in 1980, will long remain the ultimate reference for all students of
Georgian morphology once they have gained a reading-knowledge of the
language. The Georgian Academy published the 8-volume Explanatory
Dictionary of the Georgian Language (KEGL, in abbreviation of its native
title, viz. kart+ul-i en-is gan+mart'+eb+it-i leksik'on-i) between
1950 and 1964 under the general editorship of Arnold Cikobava, who
contributed his own grammatical sketch in volume 1. I ndeed, it has to be
said that the preparation of this grammar was greatly facilitated by the
invaluable information provided by this magnificent work, for apart from
using the volumes to check the existence and morphology of many of the
verb-forms quoted, I made lavish use of the illustrations included in the
various articles consulted, many of which are quoted as presented, though
in other cases I reduced the content for concentration on the feature in
question. Working so intimately with these volumes over the months, I
came to appreciate even more than I had before just how indispensable
they are for any serious student of Georgian. I know that this dictionary
has been the target of a good deal of criticism over the years, but I am
happy to speak strongly in its defence here. It has the unparalleled
advantage over any other dictionary of Georgian in its inclusion of so much
illustrative material from attested usage. One of the great desiderata in
Kartvelology is for a really good bilingual dictionary including illustrative
material of just this kind, and the first step in any such project would
surely be to render the Georgian definitions in KEGL into some appropriate
second language (like English!) and then to publish the result in a single
volume with a greatly reduced size of font on good quality thin paper, after
the fashion of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. If such a project
could be financed, at least two observations should be borne in mind: (i) the
long quotes from the published works of Stalin that rather burden volumes
1-4 could usefully be pruned or replaced, and (ii) since citations are with
3rd person subject (and object(s)), it is not always possible to predict the
form of a verbal root in some paradigms when the subject (or direct object)
is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. given ga-(Ø-)č'r-a 'X cut Y/them', it is not
possible to predict that 'I cut X/them' is ga-v-(Ø-)č'er-i with root
expanded by -e-), so that this information should either be given as part ofINTRODUCTION7the citation for relevant verbs, or appropriate examples should be included
in the illustrative materials, which goal KEGL does not always achieve—
see the suggestions along these lines I made in Hewitt (1991a). Without
KEGL whatever value the present volume may have would have been
considerably diminished. Useful articles will also be found in the ongoing
series Questions on the Culture of Georgian Speech, whose 9th volume
appeared in 1989. Numerous dialectal words are contained in the various
volumes of Materials on the History of Georgia's Domestic Industry and
Craftsmanship (in Georgian), which began publication in 1976.
Foreign investigation of Georgian began in the 17th century with the
work of Italian missionaries—for the history of the study of Caucasian
languages in general see (the Mingrelian) Arnold Chikobava (1965). In 1629
there were published in Rome the Alphabetum Ihericum, sive Georgianum,
cum Oratione Dominicali and S. Paolini's Georgian-Italian Dictionary. In
1643 M. Maggio followed these with his Georgian Grammar. Facsimiles of
these three bibliographical rarities were published in Tbilisi in 1983 under
the title First Printed Books in Georgian (Xelovneba). F. Bopp, M. Brosset
and H. Schuchardt dealt with aspects of Georgian in the 19th century, and
in 1904 A. Dirr produced his short Theoretisch-praktische Grammatik der
modernen georgischen [grusinischen] Sprache (Leipzig). More recent works
that may be consulted with profit are: G. Deeters Das
kharthwelische
Verbum (Leipzig, 1930), K. Tschenkéli Einführung in die georgische Sprache
Georgisch-Deutsches
(Zürich, 1958) in two volumes, as well as his
Wörterbuch in three volumes (1965-1974), which is easily the most
outstanding of any of the bilingual dictionaries currently available, H. Vogt
Grammaire de la langue géorgienne (Paris, 1971), H. Aronson Georgian—A
Reading Grammar (Chicago, 1982 & 1990)2, H. Fähnrich Kurze Grammatik
der georgischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1986), whilst for Old Georgian there is
this same scholar's 1982 German translation of A. Shanidze's short Grammar
of the Old Georgian Language (both the original (1976) and the translation
published in Tbilisi) as well as in his own right a grammatical sketch of
1991 and now the monograph Grammatik der altgeorgischen
Sprache
(Hamburg, 1994). My own Georgian: A Learner's Grammar (Routledge,
1995b) is now available as a self-tutor for English-speaking readers.
Standing at the intersection of Europe and Asia and occupying an
important strategic position in the Transcaucasus, Georgia has been
regarded as an attractive prize by more powerful peoples since time
immemorial. Græco-Roman, Persian, Arabic, Turkish and, latterly, Russian
influences have all left their traces on the language, especially in respect
of the lexicon. The Academy Dictionary (KEGL) states the provenance of
many foreign lexemes, and in 1964 M. C'abashvili published a dictionary of8GEORGI AN GRAMMARforeign words. The standard reference for Georgian-Iranian linguistic
contacts is the 1966 monograph by Mzia Andronik'ashvili. For ArmenoKartvelian contacts see Vogt (1938 & 1988).
1.4 The Development of the Georgian Literary Language
The natural dynamics of language-change have rendered Modern Georgian
somewhat different from its earliest attested predecessor. Given the
existence of 15 centuries of material, the urge to periodise is strong, and
the standard divisions are: 5th-11th centuries for Old Georgian, 12th-18th
centuries for Mediaeval Georgian, 19th century for the start of Modern
Georgian. However, Sardzhveladze (1984.253-275) counsels caution over
too ready an acceptance of even the basic assumption that clearly defined
breaks can be imposed on what is rather a continuum. He points out that
the period commonly thought of as representing Old Georgian is not itself
linguistically uniform, so that recognition of a certain set of changes would
justify the establishment of at least the two sub-periods (a) 5th-8th and (b)
9th-11th centuries (ibid.269ff.). The problem thereafter is that the extant
texts begin to cover other areas than the purely ecclesiastical, such that
linguistic style is to a degree determined by subject-matter, with ancient
norms prevailing but starting to be rivalled by features from the spoken
language. The Church continued to regard the classical language as the
only appropriate medium for worship and literature, with the result that, as
time passed, the language was being written according to norms that were
becoming ever more out of date and less understood. The move to rid the
literary language of this artificiality and to re-invigorate it by aligning it
with the type of Georgian people actually spoke was part of the general
movement for Georgia's national revival in the latter half of the 19th
century—for the most recent account of this period see Suny (1989.113­
MS; reprinted 1994). The most prominent supporter of modernisation was
the writer and political activist, Prince Ilia C'avc'avadze (1837-1907), who
is now universally regarded as the 'Father of the modern Georgian nation'
and who was canonised by the Georgian Church on the 150th anniversary
of his birth.
1.5 Georgian Literature
The first native work of Georgian literature (i.e. other than translations)
was Iak'ob Tsurt'aveli's Martyrdom of St. Shushanik (šušanik'is c'ameba),
which, though written between the years 476 and 483, has come down to us
in manuscripts that date from no earlier than the 10th century—aINTRODUCTION9monumental 7-language edition was published in Tbilisi in 1983 (Xelovneba).
The oldest dated manuscript thus far discovered is the Sinai Polycephalon
of 864. The oldest dated manuscript of any part of the Bible is that of the
Adysh Gospels, named after the small Svanetian village in which it was
discovered in the 19th century; its date is 897, and it was copied in the
Shat'berd monastery, one of the most important cultural centres in
Mediaeval Georgia's south-western province of K'lardzheti (present-day E.
Turkey). The most famous work of the mediaeval period is, of course, Shota
Rust(a)veli's great epic The Man in the Panther's Skin (in Georgian
vepxist'q'aosani), composed c.1200 A.D. in Georgia's Golden Age under
Queen Tamar (1184-1213). It consists of 1598 quatrains, end-rhyming for
the final two or three syllables, the best English translation of which is
undoubtedly that by Marjory Wardrop (1912 & 1966). Mention should also
be made of the chronicles known as kartlis cxovreba 'History of Georgia'
(literally 'Life of Kartli'), an English translation of part of which is now
available (Vivian 1991). The three most important literary figures of the
late 19th, early 20th century were Ilia C'avč'avadze, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli
(1840-1915), and Vazha Pshavela, pseudonym of Luk'a Razik'ashvili (18611915), all perhaps best loved for their poetical works and affectionately
known in Georgia by merely their Christian names. The finest prose-writer
of this century is deemed by many to be the Mingrelian K'onst'ant'ine
Gamsaxurdia (1891-1975), who, like Pasternak, spoke out against, and yet
somehow survived, the purges of the 'thirties—others would perhaps award
this accolade to Mixeil Dzhavaxishvili, who did not survive the purges. For
a summary of Georgian history, both political and cultural, see Salia (1975),
whilst Rayfield (1994) provides an encyclopaedic reference-guide to
Georgian literature.
1.6 Demography
According to the 1989 Soviet census there were 3,983,115 «Georgians» in
the USSR, of whom 3,787,393 resided in Georgia, where they comprised
70.1%of the republic's population. However, this total is misleading. In the
1926 census 242,990 citizens declared Mingrelian nationality, and 13,218
Svan nationality. Sometime thereafter, probably around 1930, it seems to
have been decided that these peoples were to be reclassified as
«Georgians», with the result that these minor nationalities simply
disappeared from subsequent censuses. Although in 1989 individuals again
had the right to describe themselves as belonging to the nationality they,
rather than officialdom, deemed appropriate, very few chose (for whatever
reason) to deviate from the post-1926 orthodoxy. One consequence of this10GEORGI AN GRAMMARis that there are no accurate figures for the Svan, Mingrelian and Laz
populations of Georgia, though 40,000 plus is usually quoted for Svans, and
up to one million for Mingrelians. More serious for the linguist is the
absence of data on the strength of native-speaker knowledge of all four
Kartvelian languages within Georgia. During the Soviet period all Svans as
well as the vast majority of Mingrelians and Georgians (proper) have been
educated through the medium of Georgian. The status of Georgian as the
local literary lingua franca together with the facts that (a) Georgian,
Mingrelian, Laz and Svan clearly derive from a common source, and (b)
their speakers generally share a long Christian tradition within the
Georgian Orthodox Church appears to be the main argument in defence of
viewing these peoples as one «Georgian» race. The origin of this confused
thinking is perhaps to be sought in the Georgian language itself. A
Georgian calls himself kart-v-el-i
(cf. sa-kart-v-el-o 'Georgia'),
whereas anything non-human but Georgian is kart-ul-i. The Georgian
expression for 'Kartvelian languages' is kart-v-el-ur-i
en-eb-i.
Regrettably, the language lacks the equivalent epithet for humans (*kartv-el-el-i ), with the result that kart-v-el-i 'Georgian' remains the (as
yet!) only available description. Since in English both 'Kartvelian' and
'Georgian' exist, there is no reason to overload the latter with an illogical
ambiguity.
Any attempt to argue for the non-Georgian status of
Mingrelians and Svans regularly excites a ferocious response in Georgia
(for details see Hewitt 1995a). Could this be the result of an exaggerated
desire to present their nation as more numerous (and thus stronger) than it
actually is? How else does one explain the fact that even the few thousand
North Central Caucasian Bats (Ts'ova-Tush) people, who reside exclusively
in the K'ax(et)ian village of Zemo Alvani and whose mother-tongue is in no
way related to Georgian, are equally fiercely portrayed as «Georgians» (cf.
Itonishvili 1990)? For a recent etymology of the ethnonym-root kart-v-,
which derives it from the more familiar ethnonym 'Parthian', see Shanidze
(1978).
Though united as a great feudal power from the time of David IV
(nicknamed 'The Builder', 1089-1125) through the «Golden Age» under
Queen Tamar (1184-1213) to the appearance of the Mongols in the second
quarter of the 13th century, the concept of Georgia as a single socio­
political unit did not really exist again until the birth of the revivalistmovement in the latter half of the 19th century, alluded to above. Thus,
despite its long and distinguished literary tradition, one could argue that
Georgia is quite a young nation. Despite frequent inter-regional feuding in
the past the one thing that the Georgians have always had in common is
their language, and a plausible case could be made for saying that theirINTRODUCTION11pride in, and loyalty towards, their language have contributed greatly in
helping to ensure the survival of the nation in the face of all the perils
thrown up by history. At the same time, though, such devotion can be
taken to extremes. The belief is widespread that the language suffered
repression from Russia in favour of Russian throughout the Soviet period
(1921-1991), whereas, in contradistinction to the treatment meted out to
Georgian through much of the period of Tsarist rule in the 19th century,
more objective observers would surely conclude that Georgian was given
the opportunity actually to flourish during those 70 Soviet years when it
benefited from enjoying the constitutional status as the state-language of
one of the USSR's constituent republics (Hewitt 1985, 1989a), with universal
publishing of both newspapers and books, radio- and televisionbroadcasting, and the possibility of completing the educational process
from kindergarten through university in the mother-tongue. When in 1978
the first draft for the Brezhnevite constitution made no specific mention of
Georgian being the main republican language, demonstrations forced the
then 1st Secretary, Eduard Shevardnadze, to remedy the omission, as one
may see by consulting Article 75. However, not everyone in Georgia
speaks Georgian, even as a 2nd (or 3rd) language. Consider the 1989
census-data:

(predominantly in the southern half of the autonomous republic) the nonKartvelian locals have traditionally had 2nd or 3rd language command of it.
Since Georgian was little heard here, only those who attended Georgianlanguage schools (viz. the Kartvelians) could naturally be expected to have
had a good knowledge of it. In the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast'
(Region) Georgians were in a clear minority, as shewn by the 1989 censusdata:

1.01.7 The Language-issue
Just as the position of the Georgian language played an important role in
the 19th century revivalist movement, so it soon surfaced again at the time
of nationalist stirrings in the wake of the weakening of authoritarian
controls from Moscow in the late 1980s. The first draft of T h e State
Programme for the Georgian Language', published in November 1988,INTRODUCTION13contained three crucial clauses proposing:
(13) The creation in all institutions and enterprises of favourable conditions
for citizens of non-Georgian nationality living in the republic to master the
Georgian language;
(111 10) The working out of proposals concerning the possibility of
introducing in the republic's non-Georgian (Russian, Armenian,
Azerbaydzhani, Abxazian and Ossetic) schools Georgian-language teaching
according to obligatory rule;
(111 16) The introduction of theoretical and practical courses in the
Georgian language at Georgia's higher educational establishments in the
faculties of Russian language and literature, Abxazian language and
literature, Ossetic language and literature, Armenian language and
literature, and Azeri language and literature.
In the final draft, ratified by the Georgian government in August 1989,
these three clauses were altered to read as follows:
(16) The creation in all institutions and enterprises (with financial and
teaching-methodological safeguards) of favourable conditions for citizens
living within the republic who have no knowledge of the Georgian language
to master the Georgian language;
(11113) The working out of concrete proposals concerning the introduction
of the obligatory teaching of the Georgian language in the republic's nonGeorgian schools;
(11114) The introduction of an oral test in Georgian language and literature
prior to entrance-exams for prospective students of non-Georgian sectors
at the higher educational establishments of the Georgian SSR;
(111 15) The introduction of courses in the practical stylistics of the
Georgian language and the history of Georgian language and literature in
the non-Georgian sectors of the philology faculty at the higher educational
establishments of the Georgian SSR.
The director of the Linguistics Institute of the Georgian Academy of
Sciences at the time said as an apparent after-thought at the end of a
television-discussion to celebrate The Programme's promulgation that the14GEORGI AN GRAMMARnon-Kartvelian population should in no way feel threatened by these
proposals, which, he claimed, were only designed to facilitate their learning
of Georgian. It is clear, however, that, whether an individual nonKartvelian felt he needed it or not for his daily life and work, he was going
to be forced to learn Georgian at the school of his choice and would have
to achieve a certain proficiency in it if he wished to receive higher
education in what has always been a multi-ethnic republic. If these
requirements are considered in conjunction with populist suggestions at the
time that knowledge of Georgian should be one of the pre-requisities for
obtaining citizenship in an independent Georgia, one will perhaps judge the
post-1988 apprehensions among many of the non-Kartvelians (especially
Abxazians 5 , Ossetes, Armenians and Azerbaydzhanis) in Georgia to be fully
justified. Hitherto Georgian language had been merely an optional subject
in the republic's Russian, Armenian, Azerbaydzhani, Ossetic and Abxazian
schools (for details see Hewitt 1989a).
If the proposition advanced above is correct, namely that the troubles
that began in 1989 sprang at least in part from the nationalists' forced
promotion of Georgian through The State Programme, then one could
conclude that a wiser step would have been to draw up a detailed
statement as to how all of the languages of this small, cosmopolitan land
would be safeguarded in a sovereign Georgia. In this way respect for
language could have become a source of unity rather than a factor in the
discord which led to the ferocious war in South Ossetia under the
Gamsaxurdia regime and the even bloodier conflict in Abxazia (August
1992-September 1993), as a result of which both these provinces are today
(1995) de facto independent of a disintegrating Georgia. As it is, the
continuing welfare of Georgian can hardly be doubted, though the same
cannot be said for its sister-languages Svan, Mingrelian and Laz, whose
only mention in The State Programme is in connection with their meriting
the same rights of study as Georgian's dialects proper. However, at the
time of writing it is not the continued viability of these languages that is at
issue but the very viability of the Republic of Georgia itself!
1.8 Scope of the present work
Though the general linguist will, I trust, find in the following pages
whatever he may desire to know about the workings of the Georgian
language, as it now stands this book represents my attempt to consign to
paper in the form of a fully-fledged reference grammar all the knowledge
of (as well as, I hope, the odd insight into) this challenging language that I
have acquired over the last twenty years of close study. Because of theINTRODUCTION15structure of the language it is no accident that the largest chapter below is
that devoted to the morphology of the verb. However, I have endeavoured
to give the fullest possible information also about the language's syntax,
since this is an area that is often cursorily treated, especially by native
linguists in the Caucasus.
The chapter on syntax begins with a
recapitulation of the essentials of the overall properties of the language
discussed in chapters 3 and 4, so that those primarily interested in
questions of syntax might be able to derive some benefit from the syntactic
descriptions presented in chapter 5 without necessarily having to master
all of the complex morphology that precedes them.
With the publication of my course-book for Georgian in twenty lessons
for Routledge (1995b) and the imminent appearance of my Georgian Reader
(SOAS), I now draw this chapter in my linguistic endeavours to a close,
leaving it to others to work on this language in the certainty that its future
is fully secure; henceforth I shall concentrate on at least two of the
languages in the Caucasus about whose future the same happy prediction
can sadly not be made, namely Abxaz and Mingrelian—the irony is, one
could argue, that it is in the very success of Georgian that the threat to
these languages and cultures lies.
1.9 Principles of Citation
All words are divided into constituent morphemes. Morpheme-boundaries
are indicated either by the hyphen or a plus-sign, the latter (+) being used
either when the identity of each morpheme is not important to the
particular phenomenon being explained (and thus they are not individually
glossed in those instances where morpheme-analyses are provided) or when
it is suspected that a morpheme-boudary is present but the precise analysis
might be unclear. For example, we could gloss each component of the Past
Participle 'baked' thus:
ga-mo-m-cxv-ar-i
Preverb-Preverb-Past.Participle.Prefix-bake-Past.Participle.SuffixAgreement.Marker
but it would normally be important only to know that this word is a verbal
adjective meaning 'baked', and it would therefore usually be presented
simply as:
ga+mo+m+cxv+ar-i
baked-AGR
'baked'
To illustrate the second case let us take the verbal noun (Masdar) of
the copula, q'+op+n-a, where the Masdar-formant is the final -a.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
"IntroductionThe very esšence of theGEORGIANlanguage (as well as the source of much
of its difficulty) resides in its verbal system. And it is advisable to spend a
while on an overview of the system before entering into detailed
description.
The following are the morphemes that may occur in aGEORGIANverbform, though not necessarily simultaneously: 1. Preverb(s), 2. Pronominal
Agreement-Prefix, 3. Version-Vowel, 4. Root, 5. Causative suffix(es), 6.
Inceptive/Passive Marker, 7. Thematic Suffix, 8. Perfect/Stative Marker,
9. Imperfect Marker, 10. Mood-Vowel, 11. Pronominal AgreementSuffix(es). The Prešent, Past and Aorist Subjunctive of the copula are
incorporated by some verbs into part of their conjugational paradigms. In
OldGEORGIANa further suffixal morpheme that is no longer attested in the
literary language was an element whose prešence was triggered by some
plural Nominative nouns, e.g.
c'ign-i
da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e
book-NOM
PREV-I -(it-)write-I NDI C(AOR)
'I wrote the/a book'
vs
c'ign-n-i
book-Pl-NOM
I wrote books'1da-v-(Ø-)c'er-en
PREV-I -(3rd.PER-)write-Pl(i NDI C.AOR)which latter today would be: c'ign-eb-i (/c'ign-n-i) da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e.
Detailed information is offered later in the chapter for each of the
above-morphological elements. In the meantime, preverbs can be thought
of as somewhat akin to the adverbial components of English phrasal verbs.
Version-vowels indicate certain types of relationships holding between the
verbal arguments (e.g. between subject and direct or indirect object, or118GEORGI AN GRAMMARbetween direct and indirect objects); traditionally there exist Neutral,
Subjective, Objective and locative Versions. Thematic Suffix is the term I
have chošen to describe the set of morphemes according to which the
formation of the tense-mood-aspect paradigms of the language's Transitive
and Intransitive verbs is sub-divided; other terms that have been used for
these morphemes are Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers.
A few examples of the above-verbal morphemes in concrete and regular
verbal complexes may help to give an idea of their behaviour, even if a full
understanding will only be possible once each individual morpheme has
been described in the appropriate section below—the sub-script number
relates to the morpheme-slot from the list prešented above:

Some more complex examples of the system at work are now prešented.
Verbs agree not only with just the subject, e.g.
v-k'vd-eb-iVERBAl MORPHOlOGY119I-die-TS-INDIC(PRES)
'I am dying'
mo-vid-a
PREV-come-X(AOR)
'X came'
but with both subject and direct object, e.g.
g-xed-av-en
you-see-TS-they(PRES)
'they see you'
and also with subject, direct object and indirect object, e.g.
mo-(0-0-)m-e-c-i-t
PREV-(you-X-)me-I OV-give-I NDIC(AOR)-Pl
'you (Pl) gave X/them to me'
m-i-k'vd-eb-a
me-OV-die-TS-X(PRES)
'X is dying for me/my X is dying'
mo-gv-i-vid-a
PREV-us-OV-come-X(AOR)
'X came upon us/we received X'
A verb associated with four external arguments is rare and pushes the
system to its absolute limits, but such forms manifestly cause no difficulty
to the decoder, e.g.
col-ma me
q'ur+ad+g+eb+a
wife-ERG me(DAT) attention(NOM)mi-(0-?0-)m-a-kc-ev-in-a
PREV-(it-?to.it-)me-lV-turnTS-CAUS-she(AOR)i+m pakt'-s

mart'o-sa
PREV-(it-?to.it-)me-lV-tie-TS-CAUS-X(AOR)
alone-DAT
'X couldn't make me all by myself tie a bell to the cat'120GEORGI AN GRAMMARSome verbs that are transitive by virtue of their morphology today lack
an external direct object, no doubt by virtue of loss of the relevant but
predictable noun over time, e.g.
man
mo-(?0-)ps-a
X(ERG)
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)urinate-X(AOR)
'X urinated (sc. urine = šard-i/ps+el-i)'
Some such verbs have a non-subject external argument that is actually
the indirect object, e.g.
deda-m
šv+il-s
mother-ERG child-DAT
'the mother hit the child'(?0-)s-cem-a
(?3rd.PER-)it-hit-she(AOR)what she used to hit him being the understood direct object—cf.
bi<5'-i
da-s
zurg-ši tovl-is
gunda-s
lad-NOM sister-DAT back-in
snow-GEN ball-DAT
(Ø-)s-druz-av-s
(it-)her-strike-TS(FUT)-he
'the lad will strike his sister in the back a heavy blow with a snowball'
The verb just illustrated for the meaning 'hit' is in the process of
becoming a regular transitive, such that today one often hears in place of
the prescriptively correct construction given above the non-standard
deda-m šv+il-i (Ø-)(s2 -)cem-a; another Transitive verb with missing
direct object and thus an indirect object as second argument is:
(mi-/mo-)(0-?0-0-)a-gn-eb
(PREV-)(you-?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)lV-locate-TS
'you (will) locate X/them'
and yet the autobiography of Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli contains an example with
the second argument in the Nominative alongside the Aorist Subjunctive,
viz.
ro ve+gar
that no.longer(POT)
tav+is-i
own-AGRmi-(?0-0-)a-gn-o-s
PREV-(?3rd.PER-it-)NV-locate-AOR.SUBJ-itšxam-i
venom-NOMVERBAl MORPHOlOGY121'..that it [the snake] may no longer be able to locate its own venom'
where, since there no longer seems to be an indirect object governed by
the locative Version, I have glossed the - a - as the Neutral Version (see
below 4.4.1). In the case of a third verb of this type, as seen in the
šentence p'rogres-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-g+c'-i-es 'they attained progress',
one hears constructions like p'rogres-i i-q'+o mi+g+c+e+ul-i 'progress
was made', where the underlying/original indirect object has been raised to
become subject of this analytical passive (in other words, it is treated like
a regular direct object). Ivane Imnaishvili (1971.331-335) lists 23 verbs
which in OldGEORGIANwere Transitives with just external subject and
indirect object but which today have been realigned as normal Transitives,
taking external subject and direct object in the modern language3. The
verb 'call to/summon' conforms to the prescriptive construction for 'hit', viz.
šen šen-s
you(ERG) your-AGRda-s
da-(0-?0-0-)u-jax-e!
sister-DAT PREV-(you-?3rd.PER-her-)OV-callINDIC(AOR-IMPER)
'call to/summon your sister!'
If one can think of this verb as being at least notionally tri-valent, then
the following quotation from Dolidze's opera Keto and K'ot'e is a further
example of a quadri-valent verb-form:
da-(Ø-?Ø-?Ø-)m-i-jax-e
PREV-(you-?3rd.PER-?her-)me-OV-call-I NDI C(AOR=I MPER)
barbale-s!
Barbale-DAT
'Summon Barbale for me!'.
The indirect object agreement-affix is sometimes attached immediately
before the root, e.g.
kmar-ma
pul-i
mo-(Ø-)m-c-a
husband-ERG money-NOM PREV-(it-)me-give-he(AOR)
'(my) husband gave me (the) money'
whereas a so-called 'Version'-vowel sometimes intervenes between the two,
for example with locative Version:
kmar-i
pul-s
(Ø-)m-a-jl-ev-s
husband-NOM money-DAT (it-)me-lV-give-TS-he(PRES)
'(my) husband gives me (the) money'122GEORGI AN GRAMMARvs with the e-vowel that I call here 'Indirect Object Version':
šen
me
pul-i
mo-(0-0-)m-e-c-i
you(ERG) me(DAT) money-NOM PREV-(you-it-)me-I OV-giveINDIC(AOR)
'you gave (the) money to me'
vs with Objective Version:
me
ma-s
ra-s
I (NOM) X-DAT what?-DAT
'what shall I do to/with X?'v-(0-0-)u-zam?
I-(it-X-)OV-do(FUT)Given two sets of pronominal agreement-affixes, the subject usually
selects its marker from Set A, whilst the object is shewn by a Set B affix
(e.g. m-nax-av-s meB-see-TS-XA(FUT) 'X will see me'), whereas in part of
a transitive verb's set of paradigms and for certain verbs throughout their
conjugation the subject selects its marker from Set B, whilst the object is
indicated by a Set A affix (e.g. ar m-i-nax-av-s not I B - O V - s e e TS(PERF)-XA
'I have not seen X', m-q'+av-x-a + r 4
IB-have-youAbe(PRES) 'I have you').
Any individual verb-form will be classifiable as (i) Transitive, (ii)
Intransitive (passive), (iii) Medial, (iv) Indirect, (v) Stative. Whilst a single
root does not normally manifest all five types, let us take the root e'er in
an attempt to illustrate each of them: (i) (Ø-Ø-)c'er (you-X-)write(PRES)
'you write X/them', (ii) i-c'er-eb-a PASS-write-TS-X(PRES)
'X is being
written', (iii) (Ø-)c'er-a-ob which is quoted from Holisky (1981.75) as the
slang expression 'you screw around', (iv) (?)m-e-c'er-eb-a
I-IOV-writeTS-X(PRES)'\ feel like writing' 5 , (v) s-c'er-i-a ?-write-STAT(PRES)-X 'X is
(sc. in a state of having been) written'.
GEORGIAN'scomplement of tense-mood-aspect forms (generically
referred to by Kartvelologists as 'screeves' from theGEORGIANword
mc'k'riv-i 'row') are divided into three 'Series': Series I consists of Prešent
Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive, Imperfect Indicative [together constituting
the Prešent Sub-Series], Future Indicative, Future Subjunctive and
Conditional [collectively constituting the Future Sub-Series]; Series 11
incorporates just the Aorist Indicative (or Simple Past) and Aorist
Subjunctive (called by some 'Optative'); Series 111 contains the Perfect
(which screeve, when used without a negative, often implies that the
speaker is drawing an inference from some prešent evidence that some
event must have preceded or that he is reporting hearsay about anVERBAl MORPHOlOGY123unwitnessed occurrence, rather than describing an event actually
witnessed such that he can vouchsafe for the truth of what he is saying),
Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive. This three-way division is not merely
fundamental for the tripartite distinction in the morpho-syntactic marking
of subject and object of Transitive (and Medial) verbs discussed
morphologically in 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3 as well as syntactically in 5.1.7, but also
facilitates the description of the morphological patterning of the various
sub-types of verb.
Roots are normally associated with one or more preverbs, which
typically appear(s) in aspectually perfective forms 6 (which in gross terms
may be taken to mean screeves other than those of the Prešent Sub-Series,
though there are exceptions predominantly with preverbless Series 11
formations). A problem is that, apart from with verbs of motion, it is almost
always impossible to predict which preverb(s) a given root will select. Also
the lexical meaning to be assigned to a particular verb-form is often a
function not just of the root but of the union of root with this or that
preverb (some other concomitant changes, such as to the Thematic Suffix
or Version vowel, may also occur). Examples: out of the basic root c'er we
can produce such Future Indicatives as: (i) da-(Ø-)c'er-s PREV-(Y-)writeX'X will write (Y)', (ii) mi-(Ø-)s-c'er-s PREV-(Y-)Z-write.to-X 'X will write

'X will measure Y against Z' cf. mo(Ø-)g-a-zom-eb-s 'X will measure Y against you'; cf.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142]"

5.2.2.3.3. Potential
By the term 'potential' I mean clauses dependent upon introductory
expressions like 'must, ought, should, want, advise, try, be able, necessary,
possible, preferable, e t c . ' . If a finite reprešentation is required, then
where the proposition relates to the future, the Aorist SUBJunctive is used;
where it relates to the prešent, the Prešent SUBJunctive is used; where it
relates to the past, the Pluperfect is used. The complementiser rom is
optional. The Masdar serves as the non-finite reprešentation in such
expressions.
The 3rd person Prešent of the verb 'want' (u-nd-a) has been
grammaticalised as the invariant particle of obligation. Prescriptively,
nothing can stand between it and its dependent finite verb—in other words,
rom is never used in this expression, e.g.
male u+nd+a
soon it.is.necessary
'I must go soon'c'a-[v-jvid-e
PREV-[I-jgo-AOR.SUBJShould u-nd-a be functioning as the 3rd person Prešent of 'wish', then
rom is optional and other material too may separate main from subordinate
verb, e.g.

host-DAT
(he-)OV-want-it
The host wants me to go soon'(rom) male c'a-[v-jvid-e
that soon PREV-[I-]go-AOR.SUBJIf the SUBJects of the introductory and subordinate verbs are coreferential, then Equi-NP-Del may apply to produce the Masdar in place of
the Aorist SUBJunctive, e.g.

Originally full verb-forms (viz. (Ø-)e-g-eb-i-s/(Ø-)e-g-eb-a, i-kneb-a—cf. 3.6.14), today the particles e+g+eb, i+kn+eb are used in the

it is easy to see how the particles could become re-interpreted as

N.B. the ordering of the affixes on this particular verb, the complex of Set B +
Objective Versioniser preceding the Set A subject-affix.
8 While the presence here of the Pluperfect Indicative may seem synchronically
unusual, there is a simple historical explanation. This screeve arose out of the Aorist
Indicative, and in Old Georgian the Aorist Indicative was often employed in
conjunction with the now defunct particle -mca, whose function was to switch from
the indicative's factuality to counter-factuality, in which role it is oddly reminiscent of
Ancient Greek's particle 'αv (Homeric KΕ(V)—cf. the relevant lemma in Liddell and
Scott's Greek-English Lexicon). As the Pluperfect was developing, the particle at
first occurred with it in the construction under review. When the particle became
obsolete, the Pluperfect was left alone to function as the verbal marker of past
purpose-clauses. In some dialects (such as Rač'an) the IIIrd Sujunctive has taken over
this function by analogy with the use of the Present/Aorist Subjunctives in non-past
clauses of purpose.
9 In the original from a work by Shio Mgvimeli the conjunction is absent.
10 For a discussion of this element see Hewitt (1991).
11 In an earlier discussion of this construction (1987.159-16Ø) I suggested that an
alternative to the optionally negated Future Indicative was the positive Future
Subjunctive, for which I quoted the one example to hand, which was from Roman
Miminoshvili's translation of Homer's Iliad, namely:
gem+ban-ze da-v-dg-e-t,
sa+na+m
game
mooring-at
PREV-lst.PER-stand-AOR.SUBJ-PL
until
night(NOM)
ča-mo-c'v-eb-od-e-s
PREV-PREV-fall-TS-IMPERF-FUT.SUBJ-it
The Greek original (as well as the Latin and English translations I have consulted)
make it clear that the sense here should be that of 'until'—the Greek reads:
whilst the Latin is: anchoris stabiliamus, donec venerit nox intempesta, both of which
give the English 'Let us hold fast at the moorings until the beneficent night comes (in
the hope that during it the Trojans may cease from hostilities and we may then be
able to drag down all our ships)'. However, in view of the fact the Georgian main
clause contains not a stative but a dynamic verb (viz. da-v-dg-e-t 'let us take up
position' rather than v-i-dg-e-t 'let us stay in position'), I am no longer absolutely
convinced that the above example permits any interpretation other than 'Let us come
to a haltat the moorings before night falls', unless, of course, one is to understand 'Let
us come to a halt at the moorings {and remain there) until the night falls'.

15 An explanation for this collocation might lie in such Old Georgian constructions as the
following, where the precursor of the modern subordinating conjunction functioned
adverbially (= 'thus') as part of the main clause (viz. (Ø-)i-t'q-od-a vitar: mo-val-s
u+jl+ier+es-i čem-sa (it-)SV-say-IMPERF-X thus PREV-come-Y stronger-NOM meDAT'X said that one stronger than him would come' (Mark 1.7, ms. O).

18 N.B. the split ara...ra flanking the verb in place of the more usual ara-per-i. The
split variant is, of course, standard in the traditional opening of fairy-tales: i-q'+o da
ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was nothing = once upon a time'.
19 The indicative mood is not impossible with this introductory verb (e.g. še+i+jl+eb+a
(Ø-Ø-)i-c-i-t 'it is possible you(PL) know...'; še+i+jl+eb+a c'a-vid-a 'it is possible X
has gone'.
20 Note the rare preverbless Pluperfect in this example, the lack of - n - in the suffixal
component being found in some dialects (the author here, Davit K'ldiashvili, came from
Imereti in W. Georgia), the result of which is to make the Pluperfect more like the
Perfect, which here would be (ga-)(0-)u-k'et-eb-i-a.","[645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655]"

Apart from its role in certain types of subordinate clause or in association
with certain modal particles, this screeve is used to express (i) wishes (and
hence is known by some as the Optative Mood), (ii) exhortations ('let's
VERB'), (iii) 3rd person commands ('X is/They are to VERB'), and (iv)
deliberative questions ('Am I/Are you etc... to VERB?'). Prohibitions
(negative commands) may be expressed by means of ar plus this screeve.
All Transitive Verbs (other than 'give', which is discussed separately in
4.1Ø), form their Aorist Subjunctive by means of either -o or -a, which
vowels are added to the form of the root used for the Aorist Indicative
with 3rd person subject and remain throughout the conjugation. The 3rd
person singular subject selects the allomorph -s, whilst the 3rd person
plural subject takes -n.
Thematic Suffix -eb
All such verbs (with the exception of two problematic roots) have their
Aorist Subjunctive in -o, thus:

Screeves of Transitive Verbs in this Series are characterised by the
phenomenon of 'inversion', which means that the subject stands in the
Dative and is co-indexed in the verb-form by means of the appropriate Set
B affix, which is accompanied in the Perfect by the Objective Version
vowels but in the Pluperfect and IIIrd Subjunctive by the Indirect Object
Version—since these versions are obligatory for these screeves, they are
devoid of any versional meaning, and the reflexive/benefactive/locational
functions of the Subjective/Objective/locative Versions respectively have
to be expressed, where needed, with III rd Series' forms by means of the
appropriate (postpositional) phrases external to the verbal complex.
Correspondingly the direct object stands in the Nominative and is coindexed by means of the appropriate Set A affix. The indirect object is
outside the verbal complex entirely, standing in the Genitive case
dependent upon the postposition -tvis 'for'.
Since the Dative nominal is the subject, a 3rd person plural animate
subject will have its plurality marked on the verb (viz. by the suffix -t),
unless the direct object is 1st or 2nd person46, whereas the plurality of a
3rd person Nominative direct object will never be indicated.
Screeves of this Series are usually of perfective aspect, so that those
roots which normally take a preverb in the Future Sub-Series and in Series
11 will do the same in Series III.
For the uses of this Series see Peikrishvili (1974), a work which is259VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

234lat'avra Gelenidze's Vocabulary Connected with the Anatomy-Physiology of
Man in OldGEORGIAN(Tbilisi, 1974, inGEORGIAN)should be consulted by anyone
interested in the OldGEORGIANvocabulary.
Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725) gives a rather interesting list of synonyms in his
dictionary. I quote: 'sk'ore is the general term for the outpassings [ganavaltaj of
creatures. But that of birds is called sk'int'li, that of fish t'urt'li, that of reptiles
curcli, that of goats and wild goats k'urk'li, that of cows and water-buffalo nexvi
and k'eli [N.B. ModernGEORGIANhas both k'eli and nak'elij, that of pigs čxrink'eli,
that of horses and donkeys čončorik'i, that of dogs and beasts mčore, that of men
mjgneri, dried excrement c'iva and pune, watery fæces t'rac'i, the droppings of a
pigeon naedomi.' As for the basic term, is there a connection with Ancient Greek
skč:r (Genitive skatčs) = latin stercus = Old Norse sklta = Anglo-Saxon scitan =
English shit?GEORGIANalso uses the word p'at'ivi 'honour, respect' as a synonym
(?euphemism) for nak'eli, nexvi. Note the play on words in the proverb: mic'a-s
(Ø-)u-tkv-am-s: p'at'iv-i da-(Ø-Ø-)m-a-q'ar-e da p'at'iv-s da-(Ø-)g-a-q'r-io The earth apparently said: «Cast dung upon me and I shall cast honour [sc. in terms
of a fine harvestj on you»'.
The preverb c'a- is given by Sulxan Saba Orbeliani, whilst (ga+)k'u+eb+a is given
by Fähnrich/Sardzhveladze (199Ø). Because it is reminiscent of this verb, the plural of
k'u 'tortoise' tends to be avoided — hence the attraction above the city of Tbilisi is
called k'u-s t'ba Tortoise lake' rather than k'u-eb-is t'ba.
This verb is defined in Sulxan Saba Orbeliani's dictionary as: k'ac-ta-gan kal-is
da-m+dab+1-eb-a 'the lowering (sc. corrupting) of a woman by men'. Dee Ann
Holisky in her 1981 study Aspect andGEORGIANMedial Verbs' quotes (p.75) c'er-s 'X
screws Y' vs c'er-a-ob-s 'X screws (intransitive)'. This root's non-slang meaning is,6965GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
of course, 'write'. In Mingrelian part of the paradigm of (do-)xod-u-a falls together
with that of the verb meaning 'sit down'. If in the Present b-xod-un-k is 'I fuck X'
and b-xod-u-k is 'I sit down', in the Aorist do-b-xod-i should mean both 'I fucked
X' and 'I sat down'. In fact, there seems to have been an attempt to avoid ambiguity
by producing a new form for the commoner verb; Q'ipshidze's 1914 grammar quotes
ko-do-do-b-xod-i as an alternative for the meaning 'I sat down', where, apart from
the affirmative prefix ko-, the normal preverb has been reduplicated. When I myself
was examining this verb some years ago in Ochamchira, one informant gave me the
following paradigm: do-b-xod-u-k 'I sit down' vs (ks-)do-b-do-xod-u-k 'I shall sit
down' vs (ke-)do-b-do-xod-i 'I sat down' vs the inverted do-m-Q-)xun(-u) 'I have
sat down'. What seems to be happening is that, as is generally more common in
Mingrelian than Georgian, the preverb is not restricted to the non-Present, so that the
Present here begins with the root's normal preverb. In addition to the affirmative
prefix, both the Future and Aorist shew reduplication of the normal preverb but with
the difference from the form given by Q'ipshidze that the inner preverb has fused with
the root, forcing the subject-marker to follow one instance of the preverb but precede
the second.
Expressions for 'dying' (specifically 'the woman died') include the following: kal-i mok'vd-a = kal-i garda-i-cval-a = kal-ma sul-i gan-(0-?0-)u-t'ev-a (lit. X gave
up the soul') = kal-ma c'er+il-i c'a-(0-)i-g-o (lit. 'X took the letter') = kal-ma
sul-i da-(0-)l-i-a (lit. 'X drank the soul') = kal-s sul-i a-mo-(0-)xd-a.","[703, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715]"

5.1.8.1.3 Di transí ti ve Verbs
When a ditransitive verb is made causative, the subject of the embedded
ditransitive becomes indirect object of the matrix causative, the embedded
indirect object becomes an oblique object governed by the usual
postposition -tvis Tor', whilst the embedded direct object remains in the
direct object role, e.g.
mo+c'ap+e-m
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s
vaäl-i
pupil-ERGA
teacher-DATB
apple-NOMB

When a verb such as this last occurs in a Series III screeve, two of
the array of arguments have to be dependent on the postposition -tvis:

In both instances we note that the causee precedes the similarly
marked embedded indirect object in terms of word-order.
5.1.8.2 Analytic Causatives
If the verb i(+)jul-eb-a 'causing' fulfils the function of matrix causative
verb, then the embedded verb will normally stand either in the Aorist
Subjunctive (sc. after a non-past main verb) or in the Pluperfect (sc. after
a past main verb), e.g.
xalx-ma

N.B. In OldGEORGIANthe Transitive verb i(+)jul-eb-a was construed
with a subject, indirect object for the causee and an 'infinitive' (viz. the
Masdar in the Adverbial case) with its own arguments to reprešent the
embedded clause, e.g.

Noun- and adjective-complements of the copula stand in the Nominative
case, the copula usually following or, if 3rd person singular, attached to
the predicate in its reduced form, e.g.
čem-i
mezobel-i (a) mgvdel-i

(b) tav+xed-i

'My neighbour is (a) a priest (b) arrogant'
The same is true of ga-xd-om-a 'becoming', e.g.

verb:
ga-(Ø-)xd-i-t
PREV-(you-)become-AOR.INDIC(=lMPER)-Pl
m+sax+ur-ad
servant-ADV
'Become a true servant of the nation!'er-is
č'ešmarit'
nation-GEN trueIn a colloquialism meaning 'be able to' in explicitly or implicitly negative
šentences it is the Dative that forms the complement of this verb, e.g.
ra-s
what-DATga-xd-eb-od-a? —
PREV-become-TS-I MPERF(=CONDI T)-Xvera(+per)-s
nothing(POT)DAT(sc. ga-xd-eb-od-a)
'What would X have been able to do?—(sc. X could have done) nothing'
Cf. 5.1.7 above for other Intransitive verbs coupled with unusual Dative
arguments and see 5.1.13.2 below for a possible explanation.
If the Future Participle combines with an adjective like advil-i 'easy'562GEORGIANGRAMMARas part of the complement, it may either remain as part of the Nominative
predicate, e.g.
sxv-is

or it may be placed in the Adverbial case, leaving the adjective advil-i
alone to function as the immediate complement of the copula, e.g.
...advil-i ar a+r-i-s sa-p'ov+n-el-ad
A similar phenomenon occurs when this participle is construed with the
verbs q'+ol-a 'having (someone)' and k+on-a 'having (something)', e.g.
sad-me
g-a-kv-s
c'a-sa-svl-el-i/

5.1.9.1 Apposition
Straightforward noun- and adjective-complements might be viewed as a
type of apposition. When standing in clear apposition to some noun, the
relevant adjective will take on the same cašending as that noun, e.g.

verb:

bow=arrow-GEN victim-ADV
PREV-you-make-TS(lst.PER.
FuT)
'I shall make you a victim of my bow and arrow'5.1.1Ø Reflexives
In the abšence of a distinct reflexive pronoun, the noun tav-i 'head'
(always in the singular) serves as surrogate, preceded, should emphasis be
required, by the possessive pronoun that is coreferential with the
controlling subject. For Indirect Verbs the control is the 'logical' subject in
the Dative, just as it is the Dative noun in Series III of Transitive and
Medial Verbs, e.g.
(šen-s)
tav-s
mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'l-av?
your-AGR head-DAT PREV-(you-it-)SV-kIII-TS(FuT)
'will you kIII yourself?'
(me)
(dem-i) tav-i
m-i-q'var-s
I(DATB) my-AGR head-NOMA IB-OV-love-itA
'I love myself
The form of the possessive adjective in the case of 3rd person
reflexives will be the adjective built on the Genitive case of t a v - i
'head/self, namely tav+is-i 'his/her/its own', if the singular is required,
otherwise tav+ian+t-i 'their own' in the plural (though even in the plural
tav+is-i is not unknown), e.g.
sark'e-ši (tav+ian+t) tav-s
da-(Ø-)i-nax-av-en
mirror-in their.own
head-DAT PREV-(it-)SV-notice-TS(FuT)-they
They will notice themselves in the mirror'
It is not only subjects that may act as the control for the use of these
reflexive possessives, e.g.","[577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582]"

To use the negated Pluperfect here (ar mo-(Ø-)e-mzad-eb-in-a)
would give the meaning 'X was afraid the pupil would prepare the lesson').
If it is the main verb which is negated, then the subordinate clause will
take the form of fully indirect or semi-indirect speech, e.g.
ar m-e-äin-od-a,
rom čem-i
sa+i+dum+1+o

If a negated and non-past introductory verb is also queried, then the
subordinate clause's Future Indicative may be replaced by the (nonnegated) Aorist SUBJunctive, a Prešent Indicative in the subordinate clause
being replaceable by the (non-negated) Prešent SUBJunctive. If the negated
and queried introductory verb is past, then the (non-negated) Pluperfect
may be used in addition to either the Future Indicative or the Conditional
to convey that the fear relates to the future, relative to the moment of the
fear, e.g.

5.2.2.3.1.1 Speech-reporting (Indirect Statements)
The noun-clause construction just described provides the language with its
method for the fully indirect reporting of speech. Appropriate changes of
tense and person take place, e.g.
iza-m
(Ø-)gv-i-txr-a,
rom me+or+e dge-s
Iza-ERG (it-)us-OV-tell-she(AOR)

da xom mo-vid-a?
PREV-come-IMPERF-she(CONDIT) and surely PREV-come-she(AOR)
'Iza told us she would come the next day, and she came, didn't she?'
However, the preferred way of speech-reporting, especially in spoken
GEORGIAN,is to quote the words used accompanied by one of the language's
three speech-particles.
5.2.2.3.1.2 Direct Quotation
The three speech-particles are: -me+tk+i, which derives from me v-(Ø-)
tkv-i I I-(it-)say-AOR.INDIC '1 said (it)', and which, naturally, is used when
a 1st person singular speaker is repeating his own words; -tko//-tkv+a,
which derives from (Ø-Ø-)tkv-a (you-it-)say-AOR.SUBJ 'you should say
(it)', and which is used either when a 1st person speaker is instructing the
addressee what words to repeat or when a 1st person speaker (singular or
plural) is repeating his//their own words; -o is used in all other
circumstances, also being possible when the speaker is 1st person plural.","[632, 633]"
"SYNTAX5315.1.1.4 Ergative (mo+txr+ob+it-i)
In the literary language and most of the dialects this case has but the one
function of marking the subject of Transitive and Medial verbs (i.e.
transitive verb-forms) in Series 11.
If we take expletives like g m e r t - m a n - i 'by God!' or a + m - i s - m a
mze-m this-GEN-AGR sun-ERG 'by this one's sun! = may the sun bless this
one!', it may look as though there is a further function to be described. But
it is likely that such expressions can be traced back to full phrases where
the Ergative will be seen to be performing its basic role; the former
example, for instance, comes from gmert-man (Ø-)i-c-i-s God-ERG
(3rd.PER-)SV-know-PRES.INDIC-he 'God knows'.
5.1.1.5 Dative (mi+c+em+it-i)
This case proto-typically marks (a) indirect objects but can also mark
(b) some direct objects as well as
(c) some logical subjects;
(d) a number of postpositions govern the Dative; (e) it parallels the
Nominative in temporal expressions of duration and regularity (e.g. q'ovel
dge-s/tve-s/k'vira-s/game-s/c'el-s 'every day/month/week/night/
year');
(f) stating the day and, if the month is mentioned, dates requires the Dative
(e.g. šabat-s 'on Saturday', p'irvel mais-s first May-DAT = 'on 1st May',
or noember-s 2 November-DAT = 'on 2nd November—N.B. the cardinal
is used for numbers not involving the element 'first'), whereas the
postposition -Si is used if only the number is given (e.g. p'irvel-ši 'on the
1st', or-ši 'on the 2nd')—other specific time-points include: dila-s 'in the
morning', sa(+)gam(+)o-s 'in the evening', na + sadil + e v - s 'in the
afternoon', dge-s 'today', šua-dge-s 'at mid-day' (cf. the GEN-DAT ending
in the synonymous šua-dg-isa-s, and note that for 'at mid-night' only this
complex ending šua-gam-isa-s is offered in the dictionaries),
na+šua+gam+ev-s 'in the early hours';
(g) today the postpositions -šl 'in, at' and -ze 'on, at' are usually employed
where OldGEORGIANcould happily have used just the Dative, and there are
at least three nouns where the simple Dative (albeit with an unusual avowel before the Dative-suffix -s) are stIII as common as the postpositional
equivalents (viz. a+m a+dg+il-as/a+dg+il-ze 'at this place', a+m c'ut-532GEORGIANGRAMMARa s / c ' u t - š i '(at) this minute', (na+)p'ir-as 'on the edge' = ( n a + ) p ' i r z e / k ' i d e - z e as in č'-is p'ir-as 'on the edge of the well', m i n d v r - i s
na+p'ir-as 'on the edge of the meadow');
(h) The verb 'to prefer' is an Indirect Verb with logical subject in the
Dative and logical object in the Nominative. Nevertheless, the entity to
which the logical object is preferred, when expressed, also stands in the
Dative, e.g.
m-i-rč(+)ev(+)n-i-a
p'ur-i
gorn-s
I -OV-prefer-PRES-it
bread-NOM grits-DAT
'I prefer bread to grits'
kal-s

šen-s
woman-DAT I-(she-)OV-prefer-PRES-I-COP
your-AGR
'the woman prefers me to you'tav-s
head-DATIn the related Mingrelian language the postposition -s'a must attach to
the entity preferred (e.g. respectively for these same meanings m-i-sxunu kobal-i gum-ša and osur-s v-(Ø-)u-sxun-u-k skan+i dud+i-ša);
(i) See 5.1.3 and 5.2.2.2.3 for the Dative with participles, and 5.1.5 for the
Dative accompanying the Masdar.
5.1.1.6 Instrumental (mo+km+ed+eb+it-i)
This basically signifies (a) the instrument or means by which an action is
accomplished (e.g. sxv-is-i xel-it ga-k'et-eb-ul-i sa(+)km(+)e otherGEN-AGR hand-INST PREV-make-TS-RPTC-AGR
deed(NOM) = 'a deed
done at another's hand');
(b) the postposition -urt (from cardinal ert-i '1') governs the Instrumental
and shews accompaniment (e.g. col=šv(+)il-it-urt 'with wife and child',
with which is synonymous the Adverbial of an adjective in -Ian-:
c o l = š v ( + ) i l - i a n - a d , which in turn is paralleled by the comitative
postposition - t a n followed by the Adverbial of the cardinal T :
col=šv(+)il-tan ert-ad);
(c) the Instrumental has certain temporal functions: when a non-continuous
activity has an effect that lasts for some time, that period is marked by the
Instrumental, e.g.
a+k
hereča-mo-[v-jved-i
PREV-PREV-[I-jcome-AOR.INDIC(//čem-i

ekvs-i tv-it
PREV-PREY-I-(him-)NV-šend-AOR.INDIC
6-AGR month-INST
'I have come here (//šent my student here) for 6 months'If the Dative alone can refer to a specific point in time, one can take
season- and week-names (plus a few others) and add to them the abstractnoun formant -oba in the Instrumental to indicate, in most cases,
habituality, expressions which are synonymous with combinations of the
type 'q'ovel + DAT' (e.g. o r + š a b a t - o b - i t 'on Mondays', z a m t r - o b - i t
'(regularly) in the winter', sa(+)gam(+)o-ob-it 'of an evening', though here
the plain Instrumental sa(+)gam(+)o-ti (= q'ovel sa(+)gam(+)o-s)
suffices; cT-ob-it, however, means rather 'over a period of years', as seen
in:
cT-ob-it
šjen-il-s
(Ø-)k'arg-av-s
year-ABST-INST PREV-acquire-P.PTC-DAT
(it-)lošTS-X
c'am-ita
second-INST
'What X has acquired over a period of years X loses in a second'
The expression 'in a second', however, is usually Dative c ' a m - s or
postpositional c'am-ši, but dil-it 'in the morning' is used like the Dative
dila-s especially in such phrases as dil-it adre//adr+ian(+ad) 'early in
the morning');
(d) the verb 'take advantage of' governs an object in the Instrumental, e.g.
v-(?Ø-)i-sa+rg+eb+l-eb
I -(?3rd.PER-)SV-take.advantage.of-TS(FuT)
'I shall take advantage of this occasion'a+m še+mtxv+ev-it

(f) compass-points in expressions such as 'to the north (of X)' utilise the
Instrumental (e.g. (zugdid-is)
(5rdilo+et-it/sa+mxr+et-it/da+sa+
vl+et-it/ag+mo+sa+vl+et-it Zugdidi-GEN
north-INST/south-INST/
west-INST/east/-INST
'to the north/south/west/east (of Zugdidi)');
(g) some expressions stand in the Instrumental (e.g. čem-i(s) azr-it 'in my
opinion', i+m mi+mart+ul+eb-it 'in that direction', ded-it svan-i-a
mother-INST Svan-NOM-is 'X's a Svan on his/her mother's side', londonis dro-it 'by london-time');
(h) by adding the abstract-noun formant -oba in the Instrumental case to a
cardinal root one produces the expression for 'in NuMBERs', e.g.
jar+is+k'ac-eb-i
as-ob-it
soldier-Pl-NOM
100-ABST-INST
'the soldiers are standing in hundreds'dg-a-n-an
stand-PRES-3rd.PER.Pl-theyThis form, always invariant, can act as a sort of adjective in expressions of
the type 'NuMBERs of NOuNs', e.g.

self-DAT
'hundreds and thousands of workers are congregating under one roof'
5.1.1.7 Adverbial (vitar+eb+it-i)
Basically the case serves (a) to make a predication, e.g.
k'ac-is k'vl-a
cod+v+a-d
i-tvl-eb-a

(PREV-)PASS-turn.into-it(AOR)
'the snake turned into stone'
(b) adding the Adverbial ending to adjectives produces the equivalent535SYNTAXadverb, though some adverbs lack the final -d (e.g. lamaz-ad 'beautifully',
k'arg-ad 'well', čkar-a 'quickly', nel-a 'slowly');
(c) the Future Participle in the Adverbial is a non-finite way of expressing
a purpošclause and will be exemplified below (5.2.2.1.1);
(d) governed by the postposition -mde (older form -mdis) 'upto' the case's
final -d is dropped in ModernGEORGIAN(e.g. kalak-a-mde 'as far as the
town'). The postposition may be reinforced by vi+d+re, especially, it
seems, when dates are given (e.g. vi+d+re 1917 cT-a-mde upto 1917
year-ADV-upto 'upto the year 1917'1);
(e) prices are expressed by the Adverbial, e.g.
e + s beč'ed-i
v-(Ø-)i-q'id-e
this ring-NOM
I-(it-)SV-buy-AOR.INDIC
'I bought this ring for 1,ØØØ pounds'at-as

gada+targmn+il-i-a
GEORGIAN-ADVGEORGIAN(language)-on translated-NOM-is
'It is translated intoGEORGIAN'
5.1.1.8 Ablative (da+čor+eb+it-i) = Instrumental+-gan (see 3.4.3)
This simply indicates spatial or temporal source (e.g. mindvr-i(+)dan 'from
the meadow', dge-i(+)dan 'from today', i+m dg-i(+)dan 'from that day').
N.B. the middle vowel in a+k-e+dan 'from here'.
5.1.2 The Adnominal Genitive (cf. 3.1.1)
In ModernGEORGIANadnominal Genitives usually precede their head-nouns
(e.g. saxl-is k'edel-i houšGEN
wall-NOM 'the wall of the house', rtul-i
st'rukt'ur-is zmna complex-AGR structure-GEN verb(NOM) 'a verb of
complex structure'). In OldGEORGIANthis order was reversed, and the
older sequence is not unknown even today, most naturally when the headnoun stands in the Nominative or Dative. In such cases the Genitive takes
its long form (e.g. k'edel-i saxl-isa). The reason for this is that in the
ancient language the c a š e n d i n g of the head was repeated at the end of
the NP (giving in this particular example k'edel-i saxl-isa-y). Because
the palatal semi-vowel has disappeared, the nature of this structure is536GEORGIANGRAMMARobscured, but when the head-noun is Dative, the Dative ending can stIII be
repeated on the following Genitive (e.g. k'edel-s saxl-isa(-s)). Though
the modern examples of such reduplication are not unknown when the
head-noun is Vocative, Ergative and Adverbial, they have a distinctly
archaic flavour. However, there is one circumstance where this possibility
of double c a š m a r k i n g is fully utilised today, regardless of which c a š
marker follows the Genitive, and this is where the head-noun is gapped, e.g.
čem-i
my-AGRvaž+i+šv(+)il-is
son-GENkc+ev+a-m
behaviour-ERGga-m-a-oc-a,
PREV-me-NV-amazeit(AOR)kal+i+šv(+)il-isa-m
k'i
ara
daughter-GEN-ERG
however not
'My son's behaviour amazed me, but not that of my daughter'
The end-sequence -GEN-DAT (-isa-s) when associated with a verbal
noun (theGEORGIANMasdar—cf. 5.1.5) functions as a reduced temporal
clause 'at the time of VERBing', being a short-hand version of the Masdar
in the Genitive dependent upon dro-s time-DAT 'at the time (sc. of
VERBing)' (e.g. ezo-ši š e - s v l - i s a - s / / š s v l - i s dro-s yard-into PREVenter(MASD)-GEN-DAT//PREV-enter(MASD)-GEN
time-DAT 'at the
moment of entering the yard'). This same construction is found with
ordinary nouns which, while not formally masdars, have a sort of verbal
force (e.g. masal-is analiz-isa-s material-GEN analysis-GEN-DAT 'while
analysing the material').
5.1.3 The Attributive Adjective (cf. 3.2.1)
ModernGEORGIAN,unlike its older variant, places adjectives in front of
their heads. Vowel-final adjectives shew no agreement at all with their
heads, whilst the literary language has settled on the following pattern of
agreement (cf. 3.2.1 and 5.Ø.1) for consonant-finals, where mc'vane =
'green', lamaz-i = 'beautiful', and čit'-i = 'bird':NOMINATIVE

noun in the relevant c a š f o r m stands before the conjunction da 'and'. If
adjectives are conjoined with an NP, the adjective preceding da can be
treated as if it were a noun and given the long desinence appropriate to
the noun it qualifies; this phenomenon is most often seen for Genitive and
Dative NPs, e.g.

An oddity was noted in literary Georgia (ll-XI-88, p. 13): as we have
seen, adjectives meaning 'possessed of N' may be freely formed by using
the derivational suffix -ian-i, so that 'a mother with a child' will be
bavšv-ian-i deda. The noun-base of such adjectives is itself qualifiable
by an adjective, and the example in question reads: ak'van-ši m+q'+op-i
bavšv-ian-i deda-c 'and a mother with a child (being) in a cradle'. A
native speaker, when prešented with this example for comment, reacted
somewhat negatively to the prešence on the epithet of the final vocalic
agreement-affix. If such compounds as m+k'vet+r+na+k'vt+eb-ian-i
'sharp-featured' (<= m+k'vet+r-i plus na+k'vt-eb-i), naz+bumbul-ian-i
'soft-downed' and lamaz+q'd-ian-i 'with beautiful covers (of books)'
reprešent the norm, then the bare stem for the adjective (namely m+q'+op)
would indeed be anticipated here. Note also the almost exact parallel to
the oddity above in Vazha Pshavela's ga+šav+eb+ul sa+rkv+el-ian-ad
'blackened cover and all', where the qualifying participle is without any
ending.
When the kinship-terms m a m a 'father', deda 'mother', bija 'uncle',
p'ap'a/babua 'grandfather', di+deda/bebia 'grandmother', m a m + i + d a
'father's sister', and de+i+da 'mother's sister' are coupled with a possessive
adjective, the possessive is placed after the noun and written with a
hyphen to indicate that the sequence is viewed as a single word, such that
only the possessive changes for case.
Quantifiers prescriptively require the singular form of the noun, though538GEORGIANGRAMMARcolloquially the plural is also heard (e.g. or-i, ra+m(o+)den+i+me,
mraval-i cxvar-i '2/some/several sheep').
In an example like '3 Xs of Y(s)'GEORGIANtreats 'Y' as the head of the
expression, whilst the rest functions as a complex quantifier, as exemplified
by three c a š f o r m s for the expression '3 baskets of apples', where sam-i
= '3', godor-i = 'basket', and vašl-i = 'apple':

jointly can then similarly function as a complex quantifier (e.g.

Quantifiers of the form 'cardinal and a half Xs' place na+x+ev+ar-i
after the noun in conjunction with which it functions as a single complex

reduced relative clauses may be accompanied by arguments from that
clause. If the head-noun has attributes of its own, in order not to overload
the pre-nominal slot, the adjective phrase can follow the head. With active
participles of transitive verbs the underlying direct object becomes an
objective Genitive, e.g.","[549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557]"

carry the question-mark, but the fact that this Nominative nominal 'controls' the
versioniser suggests that the first zero-morph is the one without an external noun.
Under appropriate circumstances the preverb may change to mo-.
Clearly the underlying form here is /ga-0-q'v-a/. Since the 3rd person singular of
the copula in the Aorist has a similar underlying root-suffixal sequence, namely / i q'v-a/, which in this book I write i-q'+o, for consistency I should perhaps also write
ga-(0-)q'+o here.
At least this is the prescriptive rule, even if the occasional exception is found in
texts.
Note this almost literal equivalent to the English method of giving dates, whereas the
normal way today would be to say rva ianvar-s 8 January-DAT 'on the 8th
January'.
In such combinations one of these labio-dentals may fail to be pronounced.
Note that the radical labio-dental drops under the influence of this immediately
following bilabial.
As explained in 5.2.2.1.7.4.3, a past temporal clause meaning 'before' is normally
constructed with the Conditional (or Aorist). Is the presence here of the Pluperfect in
the subordinate clause the result of the influence of the preceding Pluperfect or just
a variant in the same way as English here allows both 'before you had VERBed' and
'before you VERBed'?
Interestingly in the Mingrelian language, spoken in part of West Georgia, the
Pluperfect of active voiced Transitive Verbs stands in the same relation to the
Perfect as the Imperfect Indicative does to the Present Indicative, with the Objective
Version generalised for marking the subject (e.g. do-m-(i-)č'ar(-u) = Georgian dam-i-c'er-i-a 'I have written X/them' vs do-m-(i-)č'ar-u-d(-u)
= Georgian da-me-c'er-a 'I had written X/them').
Mingrelian has formalised this semantic distinction, at least as far as Series I
screeves are concerned: i-č'ar-u 'X is being written' vs i-č'ar-e 'X can be written';
m-a-č'ar-u 'X is being written for/on me' vs m-a-č'ar-e 'I can write X/them'.
Interestingly Mingrelian uses the active voice (Transitive pattern) for both such
verbs, viz. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rz-en-k vs (Ø-Ø-)i-rz-en-k
This particular paradigm is a common Present Indicative for a number of verbs
distinguished outside the Present Sub-Series by different preverbs. Perhaps the
forms presented here are most often used in the sense of 'I remain/stay', which
implies the use of the preverb da-.
Examples in KEGL suggest that, if the indirect object is inanimate, it may be
expressed by means of the Objective Version.
This is the root-form of the Perfect as quoted by KEGL. However, in V. Topuria and
Iv. Gigineishvili's 'Orthographic Dictionary' of 1968 the root-form ga-g-i-jg-i-a is
given.
Do not confuse this with (ga-)i-njr-ev-i 'you (will) move', the Intransitive form of
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-njr-ev = (ga-XØ-Ø-)jr-av 'you (will) set X/them in motion'.
The Imperfect equivalent of sa-k'itx-i i-s-m-i-s 'a question is being posed' is sak'itx-i i-s-m-od-a.
The meaning 'come forth to meet' would result from a change of preverb to mo-.
KEGL wrongly gives this form as the impossible mo-i-xvn-a.
Note the devoicing of the back fricative in the first two persons.
For this one verb Tschenkéli (1958.I.271) reports a variant in - e .","[527, 528]"
"16GEORGI AN GRAMMARComparing this non-finite form with the finite v-i-q'av-i 'I was' vs i-q'+o
<= earlier i-q'v-a 'X was', we see that the root is -q'((a)v)- (with v marking 1st person subject, (-)i- an old passive marker 6 , -i an Indicative
exponent for the Aorist tense, and -a/+o the indicator of a 3rd person
singular subject). Readers will see that I have glossed the old passive
marker with such (Series 11 ) forms of the copula as the Subjective Version
vowel, even though, rather arbitrarily, I have glossed what in origin was
the same i-vowel in the Future Sub-Series forms of the copula, which
derive from an old passive of another root meaning 'do, make' (namely
-k(m)n-), as the Passive marker. What then in the Masdar are the
components - o p - and - n - ? An equals-sign (=) is used either where the
script would itself employ a hyphen or to indicate reduplication. A
question-mark applied to a whole word raises doubts as the
acceptability/existence of that word; when applied to an agreement-affix
within a verb, it questions either the presence of that (zero-)affix or
uncertainty as to the implied referent.
The provenance of some examples is stated, but mostly no such source
is quoted. A large number of citations are taken from the illustrative
material in KEGL; most of the rest have been noted by me over the years
from my general reading of, and/or listening to, Georgian; occasionally
simple sentences were made up by myself.
Readers cannot fail to notice the imbalance in the length of the
chapters, with Chapter 4 on verbal morphology representing more than all
the other chapters put together. This is a natural consequence of the fact
that the chief difficulty (and, to the linguist, greatest attraction) of
Georgian resides in the wonderful complexity of the verbal system. I have
endeavoured to give too much rather than too little information on the
various conjugational patterns (to such an extent that I suspect some may
accuse me of unnecessary spoon-feeding). However, as the verb is the
essence of this language, I felt it was important that readers new to the
language should be able to turn up immediately any particular 'screeve' (=
tense-, mood- or aspect-paradigm) and see how any individual sub-class of
verb conjugates therein. I have also tried to give as much guidance as I
could to help readers see and understand the many highways and byways
traversed by individual verb-roots.","[34, 35]"
"217VERBAl MORPHOlOGY4.7Screeve-formationSeries I, II and III screeves will now be described in this order for each
of the five verb-classes (Transitive, Intransitive, Medial, Indirect, Stative).
Series III Intransitive, Indirect and Stative screeves incorporate either
the Masdar or Past Participle of the relevant root—the formation of
Masdars is explained in 4.9.1, that of Past Participles in 4.9.5.
4.7.1 Transitive Class (garda+ma+val-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
The Transitive Class includes some verbs which are not today construed
with any external direct object (e.g. bavšv-ma mo-(?0-)šard-a 'the baby
urinated', mo+lar+e-m a-(?0-)i-xed-a 'the cashier looked up'). At some
stage in the history of the language these verbs will have been associated
with a direct object, which over time was dropped because of its
predictability; indeed, for the second verb illustrated above we have a
virtual synonym in OldGEORGIANshewing that the direct object will have
been 'eyes', thereby accounting for the prešence in the verb of the
Subjective Version (viz. John 17.1:
iesuag-(Ø-)i-xil-n-aJesus(ERG) PREV-(3rd.PER-)SV-look-Pl-he(AOR)tual-n-i
eye-Pl-NOMtu+is-n-i
zeca-d 3 6
own-Pl-NOM heaven-ADV
'Jesus look up = raised his eyes heavenwards'),
whilst for the first verb above one can assume some sort of internal object
as äard-l//ps+el-i 'urine'. No finiteGEORGIANverb-form exists without
the prešence of at least a Set A agreement-affix. In Series III the agent
of Transitive Verbs stands in the Dative and is taken up in the verb-form
by a Set B affix. This leaves the remaining Set A affix clearly pointing to
the (notional and/or historical) prešence of the direct object now missing
with these seemingly Intransitive verbs, e.g.
mo+lar+e-s a-(Ø-)u-xed-av-s
cahier-DAT PREV-(she-)OV-look.up-?3rd.PER(PERF)
'the cashier (has) apparently looked up'
It is because of such verbal morphology and because of the Ergative
subject-marking for these verbs in Series 11 that they are defined as
Transitive. The same applies to those verbs which, despite lacking a direct218GEORGIANGRAMMARobject, nevertheless take an indirect object, e.g.
mela-m
čit'-is
bude-s
mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-o
fox-ERG bird-GEN nest-DAT PREV-(?3rd.PER-it-)lV-locate-it(AOR)
'the fox located the bird's nest'
=> Perfect:
mela-s
čit'-is
bud-is-tvis
mi-(Ø-)u-gn-i-?a
fox-DAT bird-GEN nest-GEN-for PREV-(it-)OV-locate-PERF?3rd.PER
'the fox (has) apparently located the bird's nest'
cf. ga+m+svl+el-eb-ma gad-mo-(?0-)m-xed-es 'the passers-by looked
over at me' vs ga+m+svl+el-eb-s gad-mo-(Ø-)u-xed-av-t čem-tvis
'the passers-by apparently (have) looked over at me').
1st and IInd Series screeves will be prešented in their simplest
Versional form, which will usually, of course, be the Neutral Version. Other
Versions will be prešented and commented upon only where some particular
point needs to be made.
4.7.1.1 Series I (p'irvel-i seria)
The subject stands in the Nominative and correlates in the verb-form with
a Set A agreement-affix. Both the direct and indirect objects stand in the
Dative and correlate in the verb-form with a Set B agreement-affix.
4.7.1.1.1 Prešent Sub-Series
Preverbs are typically abšent from the three screeves of this sub-series.
However, there are instances when a preverb will be found.
4.7.1.1.1.1 Prešent Indicative (ac'+m+q'+o)
This screeve of the indicative mood (txr+ob+it-i k'ilo), which is used as
equivalent to English 'X VERBs' or 'X is VERBing' and sometimes 'X is going
to VERB', is formed by adding the appropriate agreement-affixes to a base
consisting of Version Vowel (which will be zero for some verbs in Neutral
Version) plus Root plus Thematic Suffix (sc. other than in the case of Root
Verbs). The 3rd person singular subject-marker is universally -s, which
changes to -en in the plural, except for verbs with Thematic Suffix -i,
which require 3rd person plural subjects to be marked by the allomorph
-an. Basic paradigms are set out according to the so-called 'subjectconjugation', which means that the direct object is kept constant in the 3rdVERBAl MORPHOlOGY219person (with its zero-marking on the verb), whilst the subject varies for
person and number in the canonical fashion for inflecting Indo-European
languages.
Thematic Suffix -eb
This is the commonest of the Thematic Suffixes, and most verbs of this
sub-type have Neutral Version marked by a-. Most verbs formed on nounor adjective-roots belong here, and indeed this pattern of verb-formation
remains productive, all such denominšis taking Neutral Version in a-.
Examples: garib-i 'poor' => (Ø-Ø-)a-garib-eb 'you impoverish X/them',
g m e r t - i 'god' => (Ø-Ø-)a-gmert-eb 'you deify X/them'; if the root
syncopates, it will tend to do so, though gmert- clearly does not reduce to
gvt- (e.g. c'itei-i 'red' => (Ø-Ø-)a-c'itl-eb 'you redden X/them'). If a
root ends in -a or -o, a - v - intervenes between this and any suffixal
vowel in the verb (e.g. b r m a 'blind' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-brma-v-eb 'you
(will) blind X/them', parto 'broad' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-parto-v-eb 'you (will)
broaden X/them'); if the root ends in -e, it drops (e.g. m c V a n e 'green' =>
(a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mc'van-eb 'you (will) make X/them green', m e + p + e
'sovereign' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-me+p-eb 'you (will) make X/them sovereign').
Some distinctions will later be made depending upon whether the root has a
vowel or is vowelless, as in (Ø-Ø-)d-eb 'you put X/them', (Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb
'you open X/them'.

"4.7.1.3.1 Perfect (p'irvel-i turme+ob+it-i)
This screeve'sGEORGIANdesignation translates as 'First Evidential/
Apparential/Inferential', for it is usually stated that the screeve is
employed when the speaker is referring to a past action which he did not
himself witness but assumes took place either on the basis of some prešent
result (e.g. wet ground suggests the past occurrence of rain) or because
someone has told him that it did. Certainly the Perfect is indeed found in
such contexts, with or without the particle turme 'apparently', e.g.
varsken-s
ianvr-is
rva-s
Varsken-DAT January-GEN 8-DATp'irvel-ad
first-ADV(Ø-)u-c'am-eb-i-a
(he-)OV-torture-TSPERF-heršušanik'-i
Shushanik'-NOM
'Varsken apparently first tortured Shushanik' on 8th January' 47
but it appears in a number of contexts where such a modal nuance is
difficult, if not impossible, to detect, as in examples where the subject is
1st person, e.g.
bevr+jer ga-m-i-gon-i-a
s~en-gan
e + s ambav-i
this news-NOM many+times PREV-I-OV-hear-PERF-it you-from

'how many buck-deer have I and your grandfather killed!'
where there seems little to distinguish this screeve from the Perfect in
English. Consider also the use of the Perfect: (i) for a negated past
statement whose positive equivalent would utilise the Aorist (as in this
bipersonal Intransitive Verb:

55Ø7This desiderative is not actually quoted as an existing form in the Academy
Dictionary (KEGL), which is why I have prefaced it with a question-mark for this
particular sense — the form may convey any of the meanings 'it is being written
for/to/on me' without difficulty, though in these instances it is classified as a bivalent
I ntransitive.

10 The only screeves today retaining the voiceless back fricative, which was once the
universal 2nd person subject indicator, are: the Present of the copula = x-a+r(-t)
'you (you Pl..) are', and, for the verb of motion, which is here shewn with the preverb
mo-, the Future Indicative = mo-x-val(-t) 'you (vou Pl.) will come', the Conditional =
mo-x-vid-od-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) would (have) come', the Future Subjunctive ro(m)
mo-x-vid-od-e(-t) 'if you (you(PU) were to come', the Aorist Indicative = m o - x ved-i(-t) 'you (you Pl.) came', and the Aorist Subjunctive = ro(m) mo-x-vid-e(-t)
'in order that you (you Pl.) may come'. ,

13 This h- used also to be found before - b , and it sometimes still occurs in this context.
Volume 8 of KEGL, for instance, gives the entry-form é a - h - b a r - d - e b - a PREV3rd.PER-be.entrusted-PASS-TS-X(FUT)
X will be entrused to Y'. The Dictionary of
Morphemes and Modal Elements, published in 1988, also quotes such forms as da-hbzu-i-s 'X buzzes over Y', whereas KEGL volume III, published in 1953, cites this
latter verb without the h - .
14 These two zero-morphs represent respectively 2nd person subject and 3rd person
direct object. I arbitrarily assume throughout this work that the affixal ordering is
subject-direct object-indirect object.
15 The switch in preverb is dealt with below (4.3).
16 In Old Georgian plurals in -n- always imposed their plurality on the verb.
17 There is a homonymous Indirect Verb usually used in conjunction with a negative to
mean 'have' (e.g. ara+per-i ar m-e-bad-eb-a
nothing-NOM not I-I OV-have-TSit(FUT) 'I shall have nothing', which in the Present I ndicative would be m - a - b a d - i a), but in the present instance we are dealing with the dynamic bipersonal passive of
the root -bad- 'give birth'.
18 Masdars are usually construed with the relevant preverb.
19 Both variant-masdars (abstract-nouns) are employed by KEGL in the explanation
offered of the entry-form i-rb-en-s 'X will run', namely: si-rb-il-it i-vl-i-s, r b en-it c'a-va=c'a-mo-va 'X will move about running, X will go and come away
running'.
20 The presence of a 1st or 2nd person direct object with a root that is construed with
mi- does not of course occasion any such substitution (e.g. gvino t'k'b+il-ad mim-a-jin-eb-s 'wine will sweetly lull me to sleep').","[525, 526]"

g-k'1-av-tmo-g-k'1-av-tmo-g-k'al-i-twe produce forms that are polysemous, for they could be interpreted as: (i)
'I kill/shall kill/killed you Pl.', where the pluraliser is part of the 2nd person
exponent from Set B, or (ii) 'we kill/shall kill/killed you', where the
pluraliser is part of the 1st person exponent from Set A, or (iii) 'we

been simplified by loss of one of the dentals but it is unclear which one—in
the Prešent and Future the forms here may have as a fourth reading the
one given earlier, namely 'X kills/will kill you Pl', which arises out of the
loss of - s - from Set A when followed by -t.
There are no problems with combinations of 2nd person subject and 1st

person plural allomorphs -(a/e)n/es/nen of Set A, the forms in the last133VERBAl MORPHOlOGYrow quoted are ambiguous as the 2nd person direct object could be either
singular or plural.
This brings us to the marking of indirect objects. The Set B affixes are
again employed, except that now the alternative allomorphs for the 3rd
person come into play according to the rule prešented in 2.2.7, namely: the
base- (=historically oldest) morph h- assimilates to s- when immediately
followed by any of -c, -c', - j , -č, -č', - j , -t, -t', -d, being retained as
h - before -k, -k', -g, -q', - p ' 1 3 ; before other consonants or a vowel the
zero-allophone is used. However, if until around the 2nd World War the
allophones s-, h- were still possible between 1st person subject-marker vand the root-initial consonant (e.g. mi-v-s-c'er 'I shall write to X/them',
v-h-q'v-eb-i 'I follow X/them'), today this is in general no longer true, so
that these examples would now be rendered respectively as: mi-v-c'er,

We have not yet discussed the bracketed 3rd person pluraliser from

pluraliser, prescriptive rules require that Transitive Verbs simply never
mark the plurality of a 3rd person indirect object, which is why all forms
given above for 'write to' with 3rd person indirect object were glossed as
'to X/them'. I have come across only two examples where the plurality of a
3rd person indirect object is marked with this -t on a transitive verb; the
first is from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo (29 March 1991, p.2):

'the voices too to which age does not give the means to express their
wish...'
where one would have expected (Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev-s. The second is from
Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's lord of Rach'a. The verb is one of those which are
Transitive but lack a direct object, their second argument being the
indirect object, viz.
m+sm+en+el-eb-s
listener-Pl-DATžriant'el-ma
shudder-ERGda-(?Ø-Ø-)u-ar-a-t
PREV-(?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)OV-run.
through-it(AOR)-Pl'a shudder ran through the audience'
However, if the verb is a bipersonal intransitive, it is indeed possible to
mark the plurality of the 3rd person indirect object as long as the subject
of the verb is 3rd person singular, so that 'X will follow them' could be
either mi-h-q'v-eb-a or mi-h-q'v-eb-a-t. An attested example of this
feature with this very root, though with a different preverb, comes from
the text of Ivane Imnaishvili's 1971 Historical Chrestomathy of the
GEORGIANlanguage (vol 1. part 2) (p.344):VERBAl MORPHOlOGY135zog+jer

'From their own root only the Prešent Indicative (etc..) are formed for

pluraliser, a consideration of these examples reveals that it cannot simply
be the prešence vs abšence of the plural indirect object in the clause, or
whether the plural indirect object precedes or follows its verb.
More will be said when describing the formation of Series 111 for
Transitive and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general about the use
with them of the two sets of pronominal affixes, but it is appropriate to
note at this point that, since with these forms the Dative nominal functions
as subject and the Nominative as direct object, the Set B affixes reprešent
the subject, whilst the Set A affixes correlate with the direct object. As
plural 3rd person human subjects impose their plurality on the verb, in
these instances the plurality of the Dative nominal will always be marked
on the verb by the suffixal -t if the Dative noun is human and if the direct
object is 3rd person (N.B. the plurality of the Nominative nominal is just
ignored as far as verbal agreement is concerned), e.g.

language, however, such examples would have marked the plurality of the

child-Pl-NOMThis suggests that during the course of its historyGEORGIANhas shifted
subject-status from the Nominative to the Dative nominal for these verbforms. There are two interesting illustrations in KEGl of what is
manifestly a bivalent Intransitive verb, namely 'be born to'. The first
comes from the great 19th century writer Ilia t'avč'avadze:
si+t'q'v+a-n-i
gul-ši
m-e-bad-eb-i-an
word-Pl-NOM
heart-in
me-I OV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-Pl
'Words/Speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'
where the old plural of the (non-human) subject imposes its plurality on the
verb 16 . This contrasts with the following from Ch'avch'avadze's equally
great contemporary, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli:
šv+il-eb-i
child-Pl-NOM(Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
(3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-Srd.PER-PlVERBAl MORPHOlOGY139'Children are born to them'
where the human Nominative subject imposes no plurality on the verb,
being indicated by the Set A singular suffix -a-, whilst the Dative indirect
object has its plurality shewn by -t, just as if this were an Indirect verb,
which it palpably is not 17 . Thus, one cannot take the mere prešence of this
pluraliser with a 3rd person entity as an indicator that the 3rd person
entity in question is viewed as the subject of the verb-form.
As already stated, this pluraliser for a 3rd person Dative nominal
should, according to prescriptivists, be found only when the Nominative
nominal is itself 3rd person. Once again, however, one does come across
instances where the pluraliser appears with 1st or 2nd person Nominative
nominals. Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography furnishes the examples:

where we would have expected none of the final dentals.
How, then, doesGEORGIANavoid having two non-zero Set B affixes
within a single verbal complex, as one would expect in the translation of
clauses like 'they give you to me'?GEORGIANavoids the difficulty by
paraphrasing one of the nominals as a 3rd person NP, which, of course,
takes a zero as its coreferential affix in the verb. The phrase in question
consists of the appropriate case of the noun tav-i 'head; self' preceded by
the possessive adjective of the paraphrased pronoun. This periphrasis then
substitutes for the direct object pronoun, e.g.
šen-i
m+s'+ob+l-eb-i

This periphrasis will even be used where the indirect object is 3rd
person, asGEORGIANseems to have a preference for interpreting a 1st or
2nd person pronominal prefix on a trivalent verb as the marker of indirect
rather than direct objecthood, e.g.
čem-i
m+š+ob+l-eb-i čem-s tav-s
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s
my-AGR parent-Pl-NOM my-AGR head-DAT teacher-DAT
(Ø-Ø-)a-bar-eb-en
(3rd.PER-her-)lV-entrust-TS-they(PRES)
'my parents are entrusting me/handing me over to the teacher'
However, where the context makes it clear which nominal is the direct
and which the indirect object, this rule may be ignored—for instance, if I
am the child, it is unlikely that my parents would be entrusting the teacher
to me, and so one might hear in place of the above čem-i m+š+ob+1-eb-i
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en, even if prescriptively this
sequence should be interpreted as though the verb were to be analysed
(Ø-)m-a-bar-eb-en with the šense 'they are entrusting X/them to me'.
KEGl provides an example of the verb 'introduce X to Y' with the
periphrastic rule observed, viz.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"

structure is '10-UNIT-more-NOm', as may be seen by taking the original
form of '11' (viz. at-ert-met'-i 10-1-more-NOm); '13' <= ""(a)t-sam-met'-i;
'17' <= *(a)t-švid-met'-i; '18' <= *(a)t-rva-met'-i (with metathesis); '19' <=
*(at-)cxra-met'-i. The multiples of 20, such as '40', are of the structure
'2-times-20-NOm'. Each multiple of 20 is then followed by da 'and' plus the
appropriate digit from 1 to 19.GEORGIANdoes not parallel English in
employing the coordinating conjunction between multiples of 100 and anyNON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY55following tens or units. When compounded, there is no Nominative (or
agreement-marker) on the non-final element(s). Nor does such an element
appear on multiples of a hundred, a thousand, a million or a billion when
these are followed by other components of the total numeral, even though
they are written as separate words (e.g. xut-as oc-da-or-i 5-100 20-&2-NOm '522'), unless they themselves are stating the multiple of the
following component (e.g. xut-as-i at-as xut-as oc-da-or-i 5-100-AGR
10-100 5-100 20-&-2-NOm '500,522'). '1,000' has the structure '10-100'.
Numerals behave just like other adjectives when used attributively with
a declining noun, but let us now examine what happens when complex
numerals consisting of more than a single word are so used. The first
illustration is for the phrase '102 women' (N.B. that after numerals and
other quantifiers aGEORGIANnoun remains in the singular):

All ordinals bar one are formed by means of the circumfix me- -e (for
other derivational functions of this circumfix see 3.9.1). The exception is
'first', which is p'ir+v+el-i; however, the expected form m e - e r t - e is
possible as an alternative (actually recommended by The Norms) for
compound ordinals with 'first' as their final component.

1,995th10,223rd57The general principle seems to be that the prefixal component of the
circumfix follows any da 'and' that may be present, otherwise it stands at
the start of the entire sequence. The exceptions are when an ordinal
between 1 and 99 follows a multiple of 100 and attracts the prefixai
element to itself, even if no da is present. Since OldGEORGIANprovides
examples where this coördinating conjunction does appear following the
multiple of a 100 (e.g. from the Life of Grlgol of Xandzta we have:
i-q'+o
garda+cval+eb+a net'ar-isa
mam-isa

year-DAT
'the death of our blessed father Grigol occurred in the 102nd year in
the numbering of his years')58GEORGIANGRAmmARperhaps the placement of the prefixal component today is determined by
the earlier presence of the now omitted coördinator. We also have in Old
GEORGIANa similar non-initial placement of the prefixal component following
the multiple of a 1,000 even though in this instance no coördinator is
present here (e.g. from The Chronography of Giorgi the monk we
have:
xut-at-as me-xut-as-e-sa

PASS-make-it(AOR) word-NOm
the
'the word was realised in the 5,500th year').
Examples are not uncommon where, regardless of the structure of the
numeral, the prefixal component of the ordinal is placed at the front of it
(e.g. me-or-as-otx-m-oc-e '280th').
When writing ordinals in abbreviated form, if Arabic numerals are
employed, then we shall have either me- followed by the numeral for those
ordinals that begin with this prefix (e.g. me-2 '2nd', me-20 '20th', me-100
'100th') or -e preceded by the numeral for those ordinals that do not begin
with the prefixal component (e.g. 21-e '21st', 33-e '33rd', 954-e '954th').
The exception is '1st', which is written as 1-li. Should Roman numerals be
employed, then they stand alone with neither prefix nor suffix.
3.2.4 Demonstrative (čven+eb+it-i) Adjectives
There is a 3-way system of deixis applicable to theGEORGIAN
demonstratives, viz. e+s 'this (by me)' vs eg 'that (by you)' vs i+s 'that
(yonder'). The forms quoted are those that are used in association with
NOMINATIVE (singular or plural) nouns, whereas for all other cases the forms
are a+m vs mag vs i+m respectively. Examples, beginning with the phrase
'this (tall, blind) woman':

used withNOMINATIVEnouns also function as demonstrative pronouns, for
which the 3rd person deictic form has the alternative shape i+gi. To this
may be suffixed the particle -ve 'just, precisely' to produce an adjective
(or pronoun) meaning '(the) same'; parallel, though less common, formations
are produced from the other two demonstratives (e+se-ve, ege-ve), both
of which mean '(the) same' but with appropriate deictic nuances. When
used adjectivally, these words may be regarded as indivisible wholes, in
which case their shape will not alter as their nouns decline, for they then
behave like vowel-final adjectives. Alternatively, the suffixal particle may
be added to the oblique form to produce a+ma-ve, maġa-ve, i+ma-ve.
These alternatives are illustrated for the most common of the three in the
expression 'the same woman':

3.2.5 Possessive (k'utvn+il+eb+it-i) Adjectives
The personal pronouns from which the adjectives to be described are
derived are presented in 3.5.1.
The possessive adjectives are: čem-i 'my', šen-i 'your (SING)', m-is-i
'his, her, its', čven-i 'our', tkven-i 'your (PL)', ma-t-i 'their'. The 3rd
person possessives decline entirely regularly, whilst the typical
declensional paradigm for the other four would be as illustrated for the
phrase 'my master/good sir':

čem(-s) bat'on-eb-ad(a)Here we notice that the possessive may end in -is when its noun is
Instrumental (especially for the phrase 'in my (etc..) opinion' = čem-i(s)
azr-it). When the noun is either Dative or Adverbial, it is perhaps more
usual for the possessive to take the form in -s. N.B. such expressions as:
čem-da
s a + b e d + n + i e r + o - d / b e d - a d 'luckily for me'; m - i s - d a
sa+u+bed+ur+o-d 'unfortunately for him/her/it'; šen-da sa+si+xar

cf. tkven-o ag+mat'+eb+ul+eba-v/u+c'mind+es+oba-v! 'Your Excel­
lency/Holiness!'.
The noun tav-i 'head' serves as the language's reflexive pronoun.
From the Genitive tav-is is formed the reflexive possessive adjective tavis-i, which strictly is used in the singular sense of 'his/her/its own'.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"

Examples can also be cited of a root (viz. -ngr- 'ruin') with
Thematic Suffix -ev, which is usually a normal bivalent Transitive,
incorporating what would thus be judged to be the Neutral Version a-vowel
coupled with a Dative indirect object without any change to the verbform's internal structure (sc. other than a presumed change in the status
of the version-vowel from Neutral to locative)—cf.

(Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's Autobiography)148GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.3 Preverbs(zmn+is+c'in+eb+i)In origin the preverbs were independently standing adverbial elements
which indicated directionality and/or orientation (sc. movement towards or
away from the speaker). Comparison of a case like postposition -gan 'from'
vs preverb ga(n)- 'out of' reveals a clear bifurcation in the development of
one such hypothesised adverbial as it solidified in the former instance with
a noun and in the latter instance with a verb (cf. postposition -Si 'in(to)' and
preverb še- 'in(to)'). Further evidence for the original independent status
of these elements comes both from the frequent examples of so-called
tmesis in OldGEORGIANtexts and from the behaviour of some of the
preverbs in modern Svan.
The original directional-orientational force of the preverbs is
preserved when they are combined with roots expressing motion. Starting
with the two preverbs of orientation, mi- and mo-, the prešent-day list of
preverbs is as follows:
Simplex
mimoa(g)ga(n)šečaga(r)dac'a(r)da-thither
hither
up
out
in
down into
across, through
away
downComplex
mi-moa(g)-moga-moše-moča-moga(r)d-mo
c'a(r)-mo[da-mo-]N.B. the older alternative forms with bracketed material are not in free
variation with their shorter variants, and their use will be described
separately below.
We can start by illustrating their usage in association with the basic
root of motion for the Prešent Indicative—for the conjugation of this verb
see 4.10. The forms below are given with 3rd person singular subject:

X goes regularly; X goes downToday mi- indicates 'thither', which is interpreted as orientation away
from either speaker or hearer (hence the translation 'go'), whereas m o indicates 'hither', which is orientation towards either speaker or hearer (or
towards a 3rd person who is in the vicinity of speaker or hearer—hence
'come'). In OldGEORGIANmo- was associated exclusively with the speaker,
so that, whereas today one can only say šen-tan mo-di-s 'X is coming to
your place', the equivalent in OldGEORGIANwould have been šen-tan midi-s. Where a verbal root implies movement, if that root has as its
preverb mi- when the movement is towards a 3rd person indirect object,
then the preverbal slot will be taken by mo- for movement towards 1st or
2nd person (e.g. mi-v-(Ø-Ø-)e-c-i 'I gave X/them to Y/them' vs m o (Ø-)g-e-c-i = OldGEORGIANmi-(Ø-)g-e-c-i 'I gave X/them to you' vs
mo-(Ø-Ø-)gv-e-c-i 'you gave X/them to us'; mi-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)mart-e 'you
addressed yourself to X/them' vs mo-(?Ø-)g-mart-es 'they addressed
themselves to you/you(PD' vs mo-(Ø-?Ø-)m-mart-e-t 'you(Pl) addressed
yourselves to me'2Ø).
Association of the two orientational preverbs in the order given
indicates movement in both directions (i.e. 'to and fro', 'back and forth').
An example would be mi-mo-di-s tav+is otax-ši 'X is pacing back and
forth/up and down in his/her own room'. Such a coupling can often be
alternatively expressed by a special reduplication consisting of m i - plus
relevant components of the verbal complex upto (usually) the end of the
root followed by (and hyphenated if written) the same sequence but with
mo- plus all appropriate inflexional material after the root (e.g. mi-mo-ixed-av-s = mi-i-xed=mo-i-xed-av-s 'X will look this way and that' 21 ;
and mi-mo-(Ø-)a-c , q'd-eb-a = mi-(Ø-)a-c , q'd=mo-(Ø-)a-c'q'd-eb-a
'X will crash into Y this way and that'). However, to judge by the relatively
few examples quoted in KEGl, in the case of the basic verb of motion
reduplication with these two orientational preverbs may imply movement
over a greater distance than is achievable in a single room, e.g.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

"192GEORGI AN GRAMMAR4.4.6 Interplay of Versions and the Marking of Arguments
Performing actions such as the following to parts of the subject's own body
naturally motivates the appearance of the Subjective Version: p'ir-s da(Ø-Ø-)i-ban 'you will wash your face', tma-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'reč' 'you will
cut your hear', cxvir-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xoc-av 'you will wipe your nose'. It
might be thought that performing these actions for another person would
result in a switch to the Objective Version, whereas in fact the indirect
object is indicated without recourse to any of the versionisers, as may be
seen in: p'ir-s da-(Ø-Ø-)m-ban 'you will wash my face', tma-s mo(Ø-)g-k'reč' 'I will cut your hear', deda cxvir-eb-s mo-(Ø-)gv-xocav-s 'mother will wipe our noses'. The same interplay is seen in the case
of taking off one's own vs another's item of clothing, viz. p'alt'o-s ga-(00-)i-xd-i 'you will take off your coat' vs p'alt'o-s ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-xd-i 'you
will remove my coat'; c'ind-eb-s ga-v-(Ø-)i-xd-i 'I shall take off my
socks/stockings' vs c'ind-eb-s bavšv-s ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)-xd-i 'I shall
remove the child's socks/stockings'; mama kud-s mo-(Ø-)i-xd-i-s 'father
will take off his hat' vs mama šv+il-s kud-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)-xd-i-s 'father
will remove the hat from his child's head'.
When it comes to putting clothing on, the Subjective Version alternates
with the locative (e.g. maisur-s ča-(Ø-Ø-)i-cv-am 'you will put on your
vest' vs maisur-s bavàv-s ča-(0-0-0-)a-cv-am 'you will put the vest
on the baby', mc'q'ems-i nabad-s mo-(Ø-)i-sx-am-s 'the shepherd will
don his felt-cloak' vs mc'q'ems-i st'umar-s nabad-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-sxam-s 'the shepherd will put his felt-cloak on the guest', kud-s da-v(Ø-)i-xur-av 'I shall put on my hat' vs inglis+el-s svan+ur kud-s dav-(Ø-Ø-)a-xur-av 'I shall put a Svan hat on the Englishman's head'—note
the three roots for putting on clothing depend on whether the item involves
a part of the body being inserted into it vs whether the item folds around
the body vs whether the items rests on the head. For the Future SubSeries and Series II of the root -sc'avl- the versional opposition just
illustrated causes a shift in meaning (viz. ucxo+el-i kart+ul-s (Ø-)is c ' a v l - i - s 'the foreigner will learnGEORGIAN'vs šukia ucxo+el-s
kart+ul-s (Ø-Ø-)a-sc'avl-i-s 'Shukia is teaching/will teach the
foreignerGEORGIAN').Cf.

friend-DAT money-DAT I-(it-3rd.PER-) lV-lend-TS(FUT)
'I '11 lend my friend the money'
vs pul-s v-(Ø-)i-sesx-eb Tll borrow the money'.
The Objective Version appears in the verb for the expression 'apologise
to X', viz.
šina+ber+a-s bodiš-s
mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-xd-i-an
spinster-DAT
apology-DAT
PREV-(it-her-)OV-pay-TS(FUT)-they
'they will apologise to the spinster'
whereas, if no recipient of the apology is indicated, the verb contains the
Subjective Version (viz. bodiš-s mo-(Ø-)i-xd-i-an 'they will apologise').

should look after the horses'
vs cxen-i da-(Ø-)i-bar-a 'X summoned his horse', or anderj-i da(Ø-)i-bar-a 'X left a will (sc. containing instructions to be executed)'—
with an alternative root for 'charge' it is the locative Version that is used,

Subjective Versional (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-gira+v-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'indeb mean 'you (will) take X/them as surety' (though tav-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-)igira+v-eb means 'you (will) mortgage all you have'), whereas Objective
Versional (da-)(0-0-0-)u-gira+v-eb = (da-)(0-0-0-)u-c'ind(r)-eb
mean 'you (will) give X/them to Y/them as surety', for which a Neutral
Versional variant with postposition -tan would be the following: ma-s-tan
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-gira+v-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c'ind(r)-eb 30
A similar
opposition between - t a n with Neutral Version vs Objective Version is
illustrated by:

Clark-Kerr'
At least three roots (namely -g- 'understand', -jer- 'believe', and - s m 'listen to') exemplify an interesting alternation between Subjective and
Objective Versions whereby the former is used in the prešence of only the
direct object reprešenting what is listened to/understood/believed, whereas
the latter is required in the prešence of the indirect object reprešenting
the person listened to/understood/believed regardless of whether the
direct object slot is externally filled or not, e.g.

'you will take a picture'
vs vi-s gada-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-g-eb (surat-s)? 'whom will you photograph?'.
With other roots the use of the Subjective Version when the verb has
no indirect object contrasts with the abšence of any versioniser in the
prešence of an indirect object. Examples: p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)i-txov 'you will
ask for bread' vs mezobel-s p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)s-txov 'you will ask the
neighbour for bread', p'olici+el-eb-ma
mo-(?Ø-)i-xed-es 'the
policemen looked in this direction' vs p'olici+el-eb-ma hulign-eb-s
m o - ( ? Ø - ) g v - x e d - e s 'the policemen looked (in this direction) at us
hooligans', (Ø-Ø-)i-k'itx-e xalx-ši 'you enquired (sc. about something)
among the people' vs xalx-s (Ø-Ø-)h-k'itx-e 'you asked the people (sc.
about something)'. With the final opposition from the previous paragraph
compare the somewhat archaic expression seen in:196GEORGIANGRAMMAR
i+m-is
tav+xed+oba-s
that-GEN arrogance-DATšen
ar
you(DAT) notmo-(Ø-)g-k'itx-av
PREV-(it-)you-seek.
answer-TS(FUT)
'I shall not ask you to answer for that person's arrogance'
Note also what happens with the root -q'id- in the Future Sub-Series
and Series II: Subjective Versional saxl-s v-(Ø-)i-q'id-i 'I'll buy a/the
house' vs saxl-s mo-(Ø-)g-q'id-i 'I'll sell the house to you' or saxl-s
mi-(Ø-Ø-)h-q'id-i kal-s 'you will sell the house to the woman' (vs the
Neutral Versional saxl-s ga-v-(Ø-)q'id-i 'I'll sell the house').
Since the Subjective Version does not always appear when one would
logically expect it, it is perhaps hardly surprising that one can adduce
examples where the locative Version wins out when either the Subjective
or the locative Version could logically be employed, e.g.
kal-ma
tav-i

clever-ERG
danger-DAT head-NOM PREV-(it-it-)lV-avoid-TShe(AOR)
'the clever one avoided the danger'
No Subjective Version is possible when the root requires the indirect
object to be marked without versioniser, e.g.
gmir-ma
tav+is-i
si+cocxl+e
še-(Ø-)s-c'ir-a
hero-ERG own-AGR
life(NOM)
PREV-(it-)it-sacrifice-he(AOR)
tav+is mam+ul-s
own
land-DAT
'the hero sacrificed his own life to his own country'
In a colloquial expression for 'gathering X together', the direct object
tav-i does not belong to the verb's subject and so would never motivate
the Subjective Version, e.g.
mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-q'ar-e
PREV-I -(it-3rd.PER-)OV-throw.together-AOR.I NDICtav-i

PREV-(it-)him-slice-they(AOR)To judge by the examples given by KEGl, the use of the locative
Version in these expressions is the less common of the alternatives, and a198GEORGIANGRAMMARcolloquialism incorporating the root -k'vet- is possible only when no
versioniser appears, viz.

muxl-eb-i

'illness weakened the man's knees'
Note the prešence of the preverb m o - in these examples, which
replaces each root's normal preverb to emphasise the fact that the action
does not apply to the whole of the indirect object. This is seen clearly in
the KEGl definition for mo-(Ø-)s-c'v-av-s, which is:
r-isa-me

Minaia-DATWe have already seen an example of the root -d- 'put' with preverb
da- taking locative Version for physical placement of the direct on the
indirect object. However, it is also possible to mark the indirect object
without a versioniser, though the attested examples suggest that this usage
is linked to less concrete cases of 'placement', e.g.

Intransitive Verbs provide examples of an opposition between locative
and Objective Versions in (virtually) synonymous expressions. Consider:
kal-i
mi-(Ø-)a-dg-eb-a
woman-NOM PREV-(it-)lV-approach-TS(FUT)-shedev-is
ogre-GENsaxl-s
houš
DAT'the woman will approach/draw near the ogre's house'
when KEGl glosses this very verb-form as:
ra-s-me
sul
axlo+s da-(Ø-)u-dg-eb-a
anything-DAT-INDEF absolutely close
PREV-(it-)OV-standTS(FUT)-X
'X will draw really close to something'
where the root is identical, though this time with Objective Version and a
different preverb; another verb for 'approach' also illustrates Objective
Version, namely:
kal-i mi-(Ø-)u-axlo+v-d-eb-a
PREV-(it-)OV-approach-PASS-TS(FUT)-Xdev-issaxl-sFor the idea of 'taking up position close by X' we have (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-)udg-eb-i, often reinforced by such a word as gverd-ze 'at the side';
however, the form (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)u-dg-eb-i is used for 'treat/examine X' as

PREV-lst.PER-{it-)OV-treatTS(FUT)-INDIC-Pl
'we shall treat/examine this question seriously'
whereas (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)u-dg-eb-i, reinforced by mxar-ši 'at the shoulder',
is used for 'support X', as in:200GEORGI AN GRAMMARp'at'ar-eb-o,mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-dek-i-tsmall-Pl-VOCPREV-(you-3rd.PER-)OV-support-AOR.I NDI C(=I MPER)Pldid-eb-s

'you will set off (on a journey)'
KEGl offers the alternative gza-s da-(Ø-Ø-)a-dg-eb-i, with the
same root this time shewing locative Version but also with a different
preverb. The transitive root -rt'q'- 'hit' shews a similar variation with the
instrument of hitting treated either as direct object (presumably its original
role) or placed in the Instrumental with the direct object unmarked
externally to the verb, viz.

'the father hit the child with his hand'
It is also possible to point to an interplay between Objective Version
and lack of versioniser with some intransitive verb-forms. An indirect
object can be associated with the basic verb of motion. I n the Future SubSeries and in Series 11 this indirect object has to be indicated by the201VERBAl MORPHOlOGYObjective Version—for mo-svl-a 'coming' this gives examples like ra mog-i-va-t? 'what will come over you(Pl)?', ra mo-gv-i-vid-od-a? 'what
would come/would have come over us?', ra mo-(Ø-)u-vid-a-t? 'what
came over them?', etc... In the Prešent Sub-Series the lack of versioniser
seems more common, for this coupling of preverb and root at any rate (e.g.
ra mo-s-di-t? 'what comes over them?'). This verb-form can also mean
with either marking of the indirect object 'receive, gain, acquire', though in
the expression 'liquid flows from' (as in:
t'an-i+dan sisxl-i
mo-s-di-od-a
body-from
blood-NOM PREV-X-flow-I MPERF-it
'blood was flowing from X's body')
it seems from KEGl's illustrations that the Objective Version is not used.
For the motion-root in association with other preverbs it will sometimes be
the case that in the Prešent Sub-Series some šense(s) may be conveyed by
either marking of the indirect object, whereas others may be particular to
one method or the other, e.g.
ra-d

However, if we take the example: cxen-s pex-i mo-s-t'q'd-a 'the
horse got its leg broken', we cannot convert this verb-form into one where
Objective Version - u - substitutes for the - s - and end up with a
synonymous expression, for such a substitution would imply a structure of
the form:

X-DATThe 'horse' remains the indirect object possessing the broken leg (and
presumably marked by the first notional zero-morph), whilst the horse's
owner is added as second indirect object, dependent upon the Objective
Version vowel. Similar analyses are called for in the case of some of those
remarkable 'Intransitive' Verbs which yet can be associated with two
arguments, e.g.

4.4.7 indirect Object Version iser
This version-vowel, if indeed it can be properly so called, basically serves
as substitute for the most widespread passive/intransitive-marker for
screeves in Series I and II, namely i-, when an indirect object is
associated with such a passive/intransitive verb. I f we take the verb-form
(i+s) i-c'er-eb-a as a monovalent passive 'X is being written', a Dative
indirect object can be associated with this verb-form simply by placing the
relevant (pro)noun in the Dative and switching the initial vowel, thus:
(ma-s) (Ø-)e-c'er-eb-a. Out of context this verb-phrase can mean: 1.
'X is being written for Y', which correlates with the active voice in
Objective Version ((vin+me vin+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-Ø-)u-c'er-s
'someone writes something for someone'); 2. 'X is being written on Y', which
correlates with the active voice in locative Version ((vin+me vin+mes/ra+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-c'er-s 'someone writes something on
someone/something'), 3. 'X is being written to Y', which correlates with the
active voice marking its indirect object without versioniser ((vin+me
vin+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-)s-c'er-s 'someone writes something to
someone'). In other words, a passive/intransitive in e- can have as many
meanings as the equivalent active voice can have different types of
semantic nuances for its range of differently marked indirect objects.
Where a range of preverbs characterises the active voice, the same range
will apply to the passive, and, since the active voice verb-forms quoted
above do not employ just one preverb outside the Prešent Sub-Series, the
same distinctions will be made for the bivalent passive, giving the following
Prešent-Future, active-passive correlations:205VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

Just as the postposition -ze often reinforces (and thereby strictly
renders superfluous) the Locative Version for active voice verbs, so the
Dative nominal with these bipersonal Intransitives sometimes gives way to
a postpositional phrase (thereby rendering them monovalent), as in:2Ø6GEORGIANGRAMMARsp'ilo

'the elephant flopped to the ground with its whole body'
vs pr+in+v+el-i mic'a-ze ga-(?Ø-)e-rtx-a 'the bird flopped down on

postpositional variant, e.g.

ča-(?Ø-)e-b-a
warrior-NOM fight-in
PREV-(?it-)IOV-get.stuck.into-he(AOR)
'the warrior got stuck into the battle'
On other occasions such verbs may be used with an indirect object or
simply without one, as appropriate, e.g.

the usual ga-(mo-), such that the derivation of the šense may be: 'be šent

The e-versioniser may mark the 'logical' subject for certain so-called
'Indirect Verbs' (such as with the root - s m - 'hear, understand, detect a
smell':VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

sound(NOM)m-e-sm-i-s i+s sun-i 'I smell that smell', m-e-sm-i-s i+s, ra-sa-c
(Ø-Ø-) amb-ob 'I understand that which you say'). Indeed, this is the
normal way of expressing such 'logical' subjects in Future Sub-Series
screeves, e.g.
pul-i
m-e-kn-eb-a
money-NOM I -IOV-have-TS(FUT)-it
'I shall have the money tomorrow'xval
tomorrowIndirect Verbs have no Series II, unless one counts the somewhat
anomalous (Ø-)e-q'+ol-a, which, as stated by KEGl, is sometimes used for
the Future (Ø-)e-q'+ol-eb-a 'X will have animate Y/them'. Similarly the
e-versioniser is employed automatically in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series 11 for Stative Verbs, whether or not there exists an external
argument in the Dative, e.g.
c'er+il-i
(?0-)e-c'er-eb-a,

'you will have the address written in your diary'
For ( š ) g - e - b r a l - e b - a 'you (will) pity X/them' there is a synonym
(š)g-bral-d-eb-a.
Two special sub-types of Indirect Verbs which have their logical
subject indicated by the e-versioniser are: (a) those that express a desire
on the part of the logical subject. Such verbs only exist in the Prešent
Sub-Series, and there is no external referent for their obligatory Set A
agreement-affix (e.g. gogo-s (Ø-)e-mger-eb-a 'the girl has a hankering
to sing', gogo-s (Ø-)e-t'ir-eb-a 'the girl has a hankering to cry', gogo-s

andSimilar formations often indicate that the action occurs without the
intention of the Dative nominal concerned; these formations are not limited
to the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. ga-m-e-cin-a 'I burst out laughing', gagv-e-gim-eb-a 'we shall break out in smiles'). (b) Indirect Verbs with the
e-versioniser and with additional Series 11 forms (but minus any preverb)
can be formed from adjectives to express the idea 'X judges Y/them to be
ADJECTIVE' (e.g. advil-i 'easy' => g-e-advil-eb-a/g-e-advil-a 'you
deem/deemed X/them to be easy', u+xerx+ul-i 'embarrassing' => g-eu + xerx + u l - e b - a / g - e - u + xerx + ul-a 'you deem/deemed X/them
embarrassing', cot'a 'few' => g-e-cot'a+v-eb-a/g-e-cot'a+v-a 'you
deed/deemed X/them too few', cx+el-i 'hot' => g - e - c x + e l - e b - a / g - e cx+el-a 'you deem/deemed X/them to be hot').

(e.g. (Ø-Ø-)e-p'at'iž-e = da-(Ø-Ø-)p'at'iž-e 'you invited X/them', though
the syntactic configuration in Series 11 is different, the former verb-form
taking a Nominative subject and Dative object, the latter an Ergative
subject and Nominative object).
For the role of the e-versioniser as obligatory component in the
marking of the verb's Dative subject in the Pluperfect and 111 rd
Subjunctive of Transitive and Medial Verbs see 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3. Apart
from the e-versioniser's role as part-marker of subjects for Transitive and
Medial Verbs in the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive, it is surprisingly
found with two related roots in their transitive Series I and 11 screeves,
and this despite the fact that their second argument is a direct rather than
indirect object (viz. (Ø-Ø-)e-j+eb 'you (will) seek X/them': (Ø-Ø-)e-j+
eb-e 'you sought X/them': g-i-j+eb-n-i-a 'you have apparently sought

iiiVersion Vowels serve to indicate certain kinds of relationship between
subject and object, or between the direct and indirect objects. We have,
according to the standard view: Neutral Version (in Ø-/a-); Subjective
Version (in i-); Objective Version (in i-/u-); locative Version (in a-); plus
what we have styled the Indirect Object Version (in e-). Where the
Objective Version is an obligatory part of the marking of the verb's subject
in the Perfect of Transitive and Medial verbs, or where the Indirect Object
Version is obligatory for the marking of the subject in the Pluperfect and
III rd Subjunctive of Transitives and Medials, they are devoid of any true
versional šense.
Roots sometimes change shape to a certain extent in (part of) Series II
and in the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive. The relevant pattern of
change may be determined by such features as: (a) whether or not the root528GEORGIANGRAMMARcontains a vowel, and (b) the nature of the root-final consonant. Total
change of the root (suppletion) is also found, determined by such features
as: (a) tense, (b) plurality of direct object (or intransitive subject), (c)
animacy of direct object (or intransitive subject).
The various patterns of verbal morphology are most conveniently
explained under the heading of which Thematic Suffix is taken by a given
root. Where no such suffix is found, we call the verb a Root (or Athematic)
Verb.
These Thematic Suffixes for Transitive verbs are prešent
throughout Series I and, apart from -i, tend to occur in the Perfect too.
The Causative marker is usually the simple -in-, sometimes the complex
-ev-in-. Causatives then belong to the class of verbs with Thematic
Suffix -eb, though most causatives will also have the verb's usual Thematic
Suffix standing BEFORE the causative-marker as well.
The subjunctive vowels are: -e, and, depending on the variety of
Aorist, -o/-a.
Depending on the tense, the indicative vowels are: -i/-e
and, for 3rd person singular, -o/-a.
Verbs (usually!) produce a verbal noun (called the 'Masdar') plus four
verbal adjectives (participles): Active, Future, Privative and Past. The
IIIrd Series of monopersonal Intransitives and Statives is built around the
Past Participle, whilst the Masdar is the base for the formation of bivalent
Intransitives (including Indirect Verbs) in Series III.
5.1 The Simple Clause (mart'iv-i c'ina+da+d+eb+a)
šentential word-order, as is to be expected for a language where nounfunctions are indicated by c a š m a r k i n g and, in part, by verb-agreement
also, is fairly free, the neutral orderings being SOV and SVO. Arguments
can be put in focus by being placed first or last in the clause. For a
detailed discussion of word-order see Apridonidze (1986).
5.1.1CašfunctionsN.B. detailed exemplification for the c a š m a r k i n g (and verbal crossreferencing) patterns for the main arguments of the different classes of
verb in the different screeve-Series will be prešented below under 5.1.7.
5.1.1.1 Nominative (saxel+ob+it-i)
The Nominative is (a) the citation-form; it also serves under appropriate
circumstances as both
(b) subject-marker and
(c) direct object-marker;SYNTAX529(d) the Nominative of nouns with consonant-final stems can be governed by
the postposition -vit 'like' (e.g. kal-i-vit 'like a woman');
(e) alternating with the Dative, the Nominative can convey temporal
duration as well as locate an event as regularly occurring in expressions of
the form 'every X', of which some have been lexicalised so as to form a
compound adverb with the underlying adjective minus its ending -i and
written with a hyphen between adjective and noun, e.g.
a+k
did-i
xan-i
ar
da-(Ø-)rč-e
here
great-AGR time-NOM not PREV-(you-)stay-AOR.SuBJ
'Don't stay here a long time'
mtel-i
game
t'k'bil-ad
m-e-)in-a
whole-AGR night(NOM) sweet-ADV I -IOV-sleep-3rd.PER(AOR)
'I slept sweetly the whole night'
q'ovel=dge 'every day', q'ovel=tve 'every month', q'ovel=k f vira 'every
week', q ' o v e l = g a m ( e ) 'every night'.
Parallel expressions, not so
lexicalised, have the adjective functioning normally and are written as
separate words (e.g. q'ovel-i saat-i 'every/each hour').
5.1.1.2 Vocative (c'od+eb+it-i)
This marginal case is used for addressing the interlocutor. However, for
personal names it is already obsolete—where the final -i of a name is part
of the root, the Vocative does not exist or, alternatively, is identical to the
Nominative (e.g. (bat'on-o) ak'ak'i (Mr-VOC) Ak'ak'i = 'Ak'ak'i');
consonant-final names use just the bare stem (e.g. (bat'on-o) zurab
'Zurab'); vowel-final names again ignore the old ending -v (e.g.
(kal+bat'on-o) k'lara (Madam-VOC) Klara = 'K'lara'). Note how the 2nd
person pronouns lose their final -n in Vocative sequences like: še k'arg-o
k'ac-o, šena 'you good man, you', which in the plural/polite form would
be: tkve k'arg-o k'ac-o, tkvena.
5.1.1.3 Genitive (na+tes+a+ob+it-i)
The Genitive (a) manifests the same range of adnominal functions that are
typically associated with this case in languages where it exists, chiefly the
function of possession;
(b) it is used to shew age (e.g. samri c'l-is xe 3-AGR year-GEN tree = 'a
3-year-old tree'; rva c'1-isa-a 8 year-GEN-is = 'X is 8 years old'), and
similarly in such expressions as:53ØGEORGIANGRAMMARert-i

'they have been married one week'a+r-i-an
be-PRES-they(c) it is governed by those postpositions that require the Genitive;

which is often in its long form, e.g.

3.8I nterjections(áoris+d+eb+ul-eb-i)In Otar Gachechiladze's 1979 monograph on interjections no fewer than 86
pages (138 to 224) are devoted to an alphabetical list of the language's
interjections with examples from literature. Clearly in this section no more
than a short selection can be offered.
A large number are used for encouraging or warding off various kinds
of animals, as one might expect from a still largely rural country.
Examples: aga-gag-aa or azgamo (to frighten dogs), agamuči or briekssie or čiee or nt'rieee (to drive sheep), atpri or haam(o(o)) (to
hurry bulls), at' or čpveooo (sign of wrath to cattle), akša or kšiii (to
alarm birds), ači ači or ace (to get a donkey moving), aču (to get a horse
started), acxa (to shoo away a cat), bela(h) (to drive sheep or goats),
diido (to settle a cow), einc' einc' einc' (to attract a pig), tbpe [sic!] or
pšvie e e (to attract cattle), tokš toká (to stop a donkey), tp tp tp (to
attract a horse), tpee oho or ogečo (to shew anger to cattle), m a a m o h
(to shew affection to cattle), mc'a (to quieten a dog), nja nja or nc'a
nc'a (to shew anger to dogs), ot'p'u or ot'pru (to hurry water-buffalo),
rru rru rruo or ǰiôi ǰiôi or ǰu ǰu ǰu ǰuk'r (to attract poultry), sih sih
sih or ssi ssi or ps or kss kss or haha(a) (to quieten dogs), tpeo ho
(to halt a bull or buffalo), čiš (to halt or drive a donkey), cicu=cicu (to
attract cats), cxa=cxa (to frighten mice or to shoo off cats), xi(i) (to get
bulls or buffalo to alter direction), hae(e) (to encourage bulls), hop't'u (to
drive water-buffalo), hohoo (to bring bulls to a halt).
Some have quite specific meanings, others may have a variety of often
contradictory senses determined by the context. Examples: aba (da) ha
or aba he lends encouragement (e.g. aba he xel-i da-(Ø-Ø-)gv-a-banin-e-t 'well O.K. then, allow us to wash our hands!'), alo (on answering the
phone), arika(t) 'careful!', apsus = maxlas 'what a pity!', agu (mothers100GEORGIANGRAMMARmimic this imitation of a baby's first utterance to soothe the child), a(a)h
may indicate emotion, prohibition, approval, a wish, regret, greeting,
surprise, sadness, fear e t c . , barakala 'well done!', bis 'encore!', bravo =
q'očag 'bravo!', gan+i 'break! (in dancing/wrestling)', deda (deda) literally
'mother!' with first syllable rise and second syllable fall is used for regret
or suprise, e(e) shews censure, grief, regret, impossibility, encouragement,
threat, surprise, fear, warning, sigh, displeasure e t c . , e(e)x indicates
wrath, grief, sadness, sighing, regret, e(e)h shews complaint, depression,
satisfaction, dissatisfaction, wrath, wishing, censure, agreement, mockery,
offence, sadness, regret, e t c . , vai(me) (cf. vah(me)) is common in
complaints and expressions of depression, weakness, torment, cursing,
anger, pleading e t c . , vax (vax) shews regret, censure, sadness, praise
and pride, mc' or m n c ' u or mc'u or nc'u doubles for ara 'no', nc'u nc'u
n c ' u 'deary me', o(o)x or o(o)h can shew sadness, anger, loathing,
wishing, pleasure, threat, pity, greeting, emotion, gratitude, satisfaction
e t c . , s + dek = st'op' 'halt!', su(s) or ssu 'shh', bst' bst' or t's(s) 'pst',
u(u) or (uu)ui or uime or uh or he(e) can convey almost anything, u(u)x
expresses a strong wish or praise, pi or pu(i) or puuu or puh s h e w
displeasure or loathing, še+s+dek 'halt! (to an opponent)', čup , ri=čup , ar
encourages a dancer, č it'a 'gotcha! (in hide-and-seek)', xabarda 'make
way!', haida(=haa) 'away!', hait' shews anger, h(h)u mainly signifies
anger, sadness, dissatisfaction.
3.8.1 Pseudo-interjections
Three terms of endearment/affection, used especially by older to younger
people or, in the case of the first two, by lovers are: šen-i č ir-i-me, ge-na+cva(l-e), and g-e-taq'va(n-e). The last (in its full guise) is an
Aorist verb-form meaning 'I worshipped you', the second an Aorist meaning
'I substituted for you', and the first comes from a full expression of the
type:
šen-i
č
ir-i
me
še-m-e-q'ar-o-s
your-AGR woe-NOM me(DAT) PREV-me-IOV-t:ast.upon-AOR.SUBJ-it
'may your woe be cast upon me'
(sc. 'may I take over your suffering and relieve you of it', which, of course,
is the basic šentiment of g-e-na+cva(l-e) too <= na+cval-i 'substitute').
Similar also is the verb-form še-mo-g-e-vl-e (literally) 'I encircled/went
round you', referring either to actual movement round the person or to a
symbolic circling movement of the hand over the person's chest, bothNON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY101rituals performed in order to transfer the target's troubles onto the
performer of this action7.
3.9 DerivationalMorphologyGEORGIANmakes extensive use of both suffixation and circumfixation.
Individual words suggest the prešence of prefixes alone, but such prefixes
are not productive (sc. other, perhaps, than in combination with some
suffixal element as part-constituent of a circumfix).
Examples:
mo-/me-: as in mo-isar-i/me-isar-i 'archer' <= isar-i 'arrow';
n a - : in addition to being a formant of often substantivised past
participles (cf. 4.9.5 for examples like na-rg-av=na-tes-i 'what has been
planted and sown' <= (da-)rg-v-a 'planting' + (da-)tes-v-a 'sowing') it is
found in such nouns as na-p'ir-i 'bank (sc. of river)' <= p'ir-i 'face, mouth';
ne-: as in ne-rg-i 'young plant' <= (da-)rg-v-a 'planting';
sa-dg-om-i 'place to stay' <= dg-om-a 'standing'; sa-šiš-i 'dangerous'
<= šiš-i 'fear';
si-je 'son-/brother-in-law' <= je 'son';
u-rč-i 'disobedient' (cf. mo-rč-il-i 'obedient').
3.9.1 Noun-derivation
-a: this suffix seems very common in the names of plants, often built on
adjective-noun, noun-adjective or Genitive-noun combinations (e.g. cxrat'q'av-a 'Iberian honeysuckle' <= cxra t'q'av-i '9 skins', cocx-magar-a
'Lythrum virgatum' <= cocx-i magar-i 'brush firm = firm brush', cxen-isk'b+il-a 'Leucojum æstivum' <= cxen-is k'b+il-i 'horse's tooth', ded-isert-a 'only child' <= ded-is 'a mother's' + ert-i T). From lurj-i 'blue' is
formed lurj-a 'blue-one, Bluey', which is often used as the proper name of
an appropriately coloured horse; c'itel-a 'measles' <= c'itel-i 'red',
papxur-a 'boaster' <= papxur-i 'shewing off'.
Note the combination of
suffixes in the diminutive tag-un-a (= tag-un-ia) 'little mouse'. All such
formations have Genitive singular in -a-s(a); on the other hand, masdars
formed by -a (see 4.9.1) have their Genitives in -is(a);
-ak'-i: this is a diminutive suffix (e.g. potol-ak'-i 'little leaf; sepal' <=
potol-i 'leaf'; gil-ak'-i 'button (= switch)' <= gil-i '(clothes') button');
-eba: this widely used abstract-noun formant is to be distinguished
from the ending -eb-a, which, as discussed in 4.9.1, is the Masdar ending102GEORGI AN GRAMMARfor verbs whose Thematic Suffix is -eb-, though Masdars are sometimes
used with what is tantamount to abstract-meaning—the Genitive singular of
both is -eb-is(a) (e.g. val+d+eb+ul-eba 'obligation' <= val+d+eb+ul-i
'obliged', čv+e+ul-eba 'habit' <= čv+e+ul-i 'usual', ert + g u l - e b a
'faithfulness' <= ert+gul-i 'faithful', da+mo+k'id+eb+ul-eba 'dependence'
<= da+mo+k'id+eb+ul-i 'dependent');
-ed-i: not a common suffix (e.g. gan-ed-i 'latitude' <= gan-i 'width',
g r j - e d - i 'longitude' <= g r j + e l - i 'long', t a n a - v a r s k ' v l a v - e d - i
'constellation' <= varsk'vlav-i 'star', q'vavil-ed-i 'mass of flowers on
stem' <= q'vavil-i 'flower', otx-k'utx-ed-i 'rectangle, quadrilateral' <=
otx-i '4' + k'utxe 'angle, corner', sam-k'utx-ed-i 'triangle', at-c'1-ed-i
'a 10-grade middle-school' <= at-i '10' + c'el-i 'year');
-et-i: this shews the place designated for the nominal stem (e.g. svanet-i 'Svaneti(a)' <= svan-i 'Svan (person)', os-et-i 'Ossetia' <= os-i 'Ossete',
somx-et-i 'Armenia' <= somex-i 'Armenian (person)', m+k'vd+r-et-i
'place of the dead/old graveyard' <= m+k'vd+ar-i 'dead person');
-ia: this is an affectionate diminutive with Genitive singular in -ia-s(a)
(e.g. bij-ia 'dear uncle' <= bija 'uncle'). It may be combined in the suffixal
sequence -un-ia (e.g. pis-un-ia 'little puss' <= piso 'puss');
+ial-i: a number of verbs of movement or sound-production contain this
element, which presumably was once a suffix (bod+ial-i 'aimless talking', it
also means 'aimless wandering' in which šense it has the synonyms
bor+ial-i and xet'+ial-i);
-ik'o: this is another affectionate diminutive (e.g. ded-ik'o 'mother
dear', da-ik'o 'dear sister', beb-ik'o = beb-o 'dear granma');
-il+o: this affectionate diminutive is only found in the Vocative, i.e. as a
form of address (e.g. ded-il+o! 'mum!', beb-il+o! 'gran!'). Also only found
in the Vocative is jal-o 'auntie!', affectionate diminutive of bi+col+a =
bij-is col-i 'aunt' = 'uncle's wife';
-nar- (-nal-i, if there is an - r - in the root): this is used to shew a
plantation or collection of types of tree (e.g. mux-nar-i 'oak-plantation' <=
muxa 'oak', arq'-nar-i/arq'-nal-i 'birch-plantation' <= arq'i 'birch', ipn[n]ar-i 'ash-grove' <= ip(a)n-i 'ash', bu<?k-nar-i 'bush-thicket' <= bučk-i
'bush'—cf. kviá-nar-i 'sandy place' <= kviša 'sand');
-ob-i: not a common suffix (e.g. maġa-ob-i 'high ground' <= maġal-i
'high, tall', kvišr-ob-i 'sandy place' <= kviáa 'sand');
-oba: this extremely common suffix is to be distinguished from -ob-a,
the Masdar ending for verbs with Thematic Suffix -ob- though Masdars
are sometimes used with what is tantamount to abstract-meaning—the
Genitive singular of both is -ob-is(a) (e.g. kal+1+áv+il-oba 'maidenhood,
virginity' <= kal+i+šv+il-i 'maiden, daughter', u+gvt+o-oba 'godlessness'NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY103<= u + g v t + o 'godless', da+mo+u + k'id + eb + 1-oba
'independence' <=
da+mo+u+k'id+eb+el-i 'independent', mo+u+tm+en+1-oba 'impatience'
<= mo+u+tm+en+el-i 'impatient');
-ua: this is an infrequent diminutive with Genitive singular in -ua-s(a)
(e.g. bič'-ua 'laddie', jal-ua 'auntie (uncle's wife)');
-uk'-i/-uk'a: sparsely used diminutive suffixes (e.g. bušt-uk'-i
'bladder', bebr-uk'a 'little old lady', which has the synonyms bebr-ucuna/bebr-ux-ana, all three with Genitives in -a-s(a));
-ula: another infrequent diminutive with Genitive singular in -ula-s(a)
(e.g. burt-ula 'little ball' <= burt-i 'ball');
+un: this element, like +ial-i above, must once have been a suffix that
has become solidified to the root of a number of verbs indicating soundproduction (e.g. brax+un-i 'stamping, knocking' cf. brax+a=brux-i 'noise,
rumpus', žgar+un-i 'tinkling', čxap'+un-i 'splashing' <= čxap , +a=čxup , -i
'splashing about', t ' q ' a p ' + u n - i 'beating, slapping'). Note the suffixal
sequences in 'little chap', dat-un-ia 'little bear' (Genitive dat-un-ias(a)) ;
-ura: this seems to be prešent in bad-ura 'netting' <= bade 'net', k'exura 'an apple-variety' named after the Kartlian village of K'exvi—Genitive
singular is in -ura-s(a); whether this suffix is prešent or not in begura
'sparrow', the Genitive is begur-is(a);
m - -ar-i: dissimilated to -al-i if the stem contains an -r-. This is
esšentially a Prešent Participle formant, but the resulting forms are largely
substantivised (e.g. m-k'vl+ev-ar-i 'researcher', m-c'er-al-i 'writer');
m—el-i: esšentially a Prešent Participle formant, often substantivised
(e.g. m - s m + e n - e l - i 'listener', m - s m - e l - i 'drinker', m-šen+eb-el-i
'builder');
ma- -el-i: esšentially a Prešent Participle formant, often substantivised
(e.g. ma-t'ar + eb-el-i 'train (lit. conveyor)', d a - m a - a + r + s + e b - e l - i
'founder', ma-sc'avl+eb-el-i 'teacher', ma-q'ur+eb-el-i 'viewer');
me—ar-i: this is found in me-om-ar-i 'warrior' <= om-i 'war';
me—e: this extremely common circumfix forms agent-nouns around
nominal roots (e.g. m e - v e n a x - e 'viticulturist' <= venax-i 'vine', m e gvin-e 'wine-producer' <= gvino 'wine', me-bag-e 'gardener' <= bag-i
'garden', m e - c x v a r - e 'shepherd' <= cxvar-i 'sheep', m e - a p t i a k - e
'chemist' <= aptiak-i 'pharmacy')—see 3.2.3.2 and 3.9.2 for this circumfix's
role as marker of ordinals;
me—e+d-i: this circumfix derives from the Adverbial case of ordinals,
which stem is then turned into a noun to form fractions, though 'half' has
the separate na+x+ev+ar-i (e.g. me-sam-e+d-i 'one third', me-at-e+d-i
'one tenth');104GEORGIANGRAMMARme- -ier-i: this is seen in me-cn-ier-i 'scientist, scholar';
me- -ur-i dissimilated to -ul-i if there is an -r- in the root (e.g. m e z g v a - u r - i 'sailor' <= zgva 'sea', m e - b a r g - u l - i 'porter' <= b a r g - i
'luggage');
mo- -ar-i dissimilated to -al-i if there is an - r - in the root. This
again is basically a Prešent Participle formant whose results are often
substantivised (e.g. mo-mger-al-i 'singer' <= (Ø-)mger-i 'you sing', m o čiv-ar-i 'complainant' <= (Ø-)čiv-i 'you complain');
mo- -e: another participle formant whose results are sometimes
substantivised (e.g. mo-nadir-e 'hunter' <= (Ø-)nadir-ob 'you hunt', m o c'ap-e 'pupil' <= (Ø-)e-c'ap-eb-i 'you apply yourself diligently to X', m o cek'v+av-e 'dancer' <= (Ø-)cek'v-av 'you dance');
na- -al-i: this is an archaic formant for fractions (e.g. na-sam-al-i
'one third');
na- -ar-i dissimilated to -al-i if there is an - r - in the root. This
indicates the site where the noun constituting the root once was (e.g. nasaxl-ar-i 'site of an old house', n a - m o n a s t ' r - a l - i 'site of former
monastery')—cf. na-bol-ar-a (Genitive in -a-s(a)) 'last born', which may
also be used adjectivally (e.g. na-bol-ar-a goč'-i 'last born piglet = runt');
na- ev-i: this is synonymous with the previous exponent (e.g. n a kalak-ev-i 'site of former town', na-sadil-ev-i 'afternoon' <= sadil-i
'lunch', or-na-kmr-ev-i 'woman who has had two husbands' <= or-i '2' +
kmar-i 'husband');
sa- -ar-i dissimilated to -al-i if there is an - r - in the root. This
circumfix basically forms some Future Participles (see 4.9.3), some of which
are substantivised (e.g. sa-pikr-al-i 'object for thought' <= (Ø-)pikr-ob
'you think', sa-c'ov-ar-i 'teat, nipple' (cf. sa-c'ov-ar-a 'dummy', whose
Genitive is in -a-s(a)) <= (Ø-Ø-)c'ov 'you suck X', sa-čiv-ar-i 'complaint'
<= (Ø-)čiv-i 'you complain');
sa- -e: this very common formant shews the thing designed to hold the
root (e.g. sa-maril-e 'salt-cellar' <= maril-i 'salt', sa-katm-e 'chickencoop' <= k a t a m - i 'chicken', sa-gor-e 'pigsty' <= gor-i 'pig', sa-perpl-e
'ash-tray' <= perpl-i 'ash', sa-burnut-e 'snuff-box' <= burnut-i 'snuff);
sa- -et-i: this is synonymous with -et-i plus an extra prefix (e.g. saprang-et-i 'France', sa-berjn-et-i 'Greece');
sa- -el-i: this is the main formant for Future Participles, some of
which have been substantivised (e.g. sa-s+m-el-i 'drink, beverage' <= ( 0 0-)sv-am 'you drink (X)', sa-č'm-el-i 'food' <= (0-0-)č'am 'you eat (X)').
Occasionally the suffix is of the form -el-a (Genitive in -a-s(a)) (e.g. saprtx + o b - e l - a 'scarecrow' <= (Ø-Ø-)a-prtx-ob 'you alarm X', s a xrč+ob-el-a 'scaffold' <= (Ø-Ø-)a-xrč-ob 'you hang X');NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY105sa- -is-i: this is a rare coupling (e.g. sa-s+m-is-i 'drinking vessel',
sa-dg-is-i 'awl', sa-c'q'-is-i 'infinitive' cf. da-sa-c'q'-is-i 'beginning' <=
(Ø-)i-c'q'-eb 'you begin (X)');
sa—o: this is used, somewhat like -et-i, to mark the place designated
for the root (e.g. sa-kart+v+el-o 'Georgia' = 'place designed for the
GEORGIANs(kart+v+el-eb-i)', sa-st'umr-o 'hotel' <= st'umar-i 'guest',
sa-bat'on-o 'dominion of the master' <= bat'on-i 'master' cf. sa-me+p-o
'kingdom' <= me+p+e 'king' and sa-up+1-o 'dominion of a lord' <= up+al-i
'lord'). With kinship-terms it derives the form for 'future RELATION' (e.g.
kmar-i 'husband' => sa-kmr-o 'fiancé', rjal-i 'daughter-/sister-in-law' =>
sa-rjl-o 'future daughter-/sister-in-law', si+mam+r-i 'father-in-law (for
males)' => sa-si+mam+r-o 'future father-in-law (for males)', deda+mt+iH
'mother-in-law (for females)' => sa-deda+mt+il-o 'future mother-in-law
(for females)'—N.B. col-i 'wife' => sa-col-e 'fiancée');
sa—ur-i dissimilated to -ul-i if there is an -r- in the root. It is not
a common coupling (e.g. sa-dg-ur-i 'station' <= dg-om-a 'standing', sapex-ur-i 'step, rung' <= pex-i 'foot', sa-rt-ul-i 'storey' <= še-rt-v-a
'joining', sa-tb-ur-i 'greenhouse' <= tb-il-i 'warm');
se- -a: is this an old circumfix seen today in se+p+a 'marquee' and
se+t'q'v+a 'hail'?
se—e: this is seen only in se-p-e = sa-me+p-o 'kingdom';
si—a: this is an old Masdar formant seen in some substantivised forms
(e.g. si-t'q'v-a 'word' cf. (Ø-Ø-)i-t'q'v-i 'you will say (X)', si-mger-a
'song' <= (Ø-)mger-i 'you sing');
si- -ar-i: this is only seen in si-zm-ar-i 'dream' cf. z m - a n - e b - a
'dream';
si—e: this common formant produces nouns from adjectives (e.g. simartl-e 'truth' <= martal-i 'true', si-cocxl-e 'life' <= cocxal-i 'alive', sicx-e 'heat, temperature' <= cx-el-i 'hot', si-mok'l-e 'shortness' <= mok'le
'short', si-mk'vircxl-e 'nimbleness' <= mk'vircxal-i 'nimble', si-mq'ral-e
'stink' <= mq'ral-i 'fetid');
si- -ed-i: si-gan-ed-i and si-grj-ed-i are synonyms for gan-ed-i
'latitude' and grj-ed-i 'longitude' respectively;
si- —il—i: this is another old Masdar formant found still in some
substantivised forms (e.g. si-k'vd-il-i 'death' cf. k'vd-om-a 'dying', sir c x v - i l - i 'shame' cf. g - r c x v - e n - i - a 'you are ashamed', s i - r b - i l - i
'running' cf. mi-rb-i-x-a+r 'you are running (thither)';
si- -ul-i: this is another old Masdar formant found still in some
substantivised forms (e.g. si-q'var-ul-i 'love' cf. m-i-qvar-x-a+r 'I love
you', si-jul+v-il-i 'hatred' cf. m-jul-x-a+r 'I hate you');
si- -o: this again forms abstract nouns from adjectives but is less106GEORGIANGRAMMARcommon than s i — e (e.g. si-t'k'b-o 'sweetness' <= t'k'b-il-i 'sweet', sitb-o 'warmth' <= tb-il-i 'warm', si-(m)sx-o 'thickness' <= m s x v - i l - i
'thick'—N.B. how all three adjectives lose the suffix -il- when the noun is
formed).
Nouns are sometimes formed by simply adding the appropriate caseending to some other part of speech. The postposition -gan governing a
plural noun (usually with the old plural ending -ta) or, as very commonly, a
plural personal pronoun regularly undergoes this derivational process, e.g.
q'vela tkven-gan-ma
all
you(PL)-from-ERGčox-eb-i
cherkesska-PL-NOMa-(Ø-)i-k'valt-o-s
PREV-(3rd.PER-)SVhitch.up-AOR.SUBJ-X'all of you are to hitch up your cherkesska(s)'
By incorporating the cardinal ert-i T into this type of expression one
is able to say 'one of X', e.g.
mt'er-i
tav-s
da-(Ø-)e-sx-a
enemy-NOM head-DAT PREV-(X-)IOV-assault-he(AOR)
ma-t-gan-s/kalak-ta-gan-s
them-GEN-from-DAT/town-GEN.PL-from-DAT
'the enemy attacked one of them/the towns'ert
onean alternative is to use ert = ert-i 'one of' as a simple adjective (e.g.
ert=ert-i u-m+nišvn+el+ovan-es-i
amocana 'one of the most
important problems').
muxl+ta+šoris-i 'inter-nodal part of a plant-stem' <= muxl-i 'knee;
leaf-node' + -ta- Genitive/Dative plural + šoris 'among, between'. This is
basically a substantivised adjective.
a+r+s-i 'creature, esšence' is simply the OldGEORGIAN3rd person
singular of the copula 'X is', which today would be a+r-i(-s), plus the
Nominative case-ending.
The same source is at the base of
a+r+s+eb+ob-a 'existence', which is Masdar of (Ø-)a+r+s+eb-ob 'you
exist'. The finite verb-form v-(Ø-)i-c-i 'I know (X)' gave rise to the
privative adjective u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant', which then became source for the
abstract noun u+v + i + c-oba 'ignorance'. We have already met the
conjunctional phrase vin+i+c+oba+a 'in case', which is the abstract noun
in—oba of the šentence vin (Ø-)i-c-i-s? 'who knows?'. The Old
GEORGIAN3rd person singular of the Prešent Indicative Passive of the verb
'read' was i-k'itx-v-i-s (today the more normal form would be i-k'itx-veb-a); this old form gives rise to the noun i+k'itx+v+i+s-i '(grammatical)NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY107reading, lectio. In OldGEORGIANthe 3rd person singular Prešent i-jvr-i-s
'X moves'8 formed the basis for the noun i-jvr-i-s-i 'snake, lizzard, reptile'
(= ModernGEORGIANkve-c'ar-ma-val-i lit. 'that which moves forward
down below', a euphemistic circumlocution for semi-taboo words like gveli 'snake').
Reduplication of roots with a change of vowel or consonant-adaptation
is a non-productive part of word-formation (e.g. abda=ubda 'nonšense',
are=mare 'surroundings').
3.9.2 Adjective-formation
Adjectives, as we have seen, may be used nominally (reduced relative
clauses), and some of the formations below may have nominal functions.
-a: added to nouns or adjective-noun phrases this indicates possession
of the relevant nominal characteristic (e.g. cal-pex-a 'one-legged' <= cal-1
'one (of two)' + pex-i 'leg' + -a, xit=xit-a 'chuckling (ADJ)' <= xit=xit-i
'chuckling (NOUN)')—if the forms appear as nouns, the Genitive is in - a s(a);
-ad-i: this suffix is simply an adjective based on the Adverbial caseending. When attached to a Masdar-base, it is the equivalent of our '-able'
(e.g. (ara-)drek'-ad-i '(un)bendable' <= drek'-a 'bending', cval+eb-ad-i
'changeable' <= cval-eb-a 'changing', žang+v-ad-i 'liable to rust' <=
žang-v-a 'rusting', gul-ad-i 'intrepid' <= gul-i 'heart'). The formation of
fractions (c'il+ob+it-i ricxv+it-i saxel-eb-i) was described in 3.9.1, but
the word for 'fraction' is c'il-ad-i <= (na+)c'il-i 'part, portion'. This word
seems to be used only as a noun, whereas at-c'il-ad-i 'decimal (fraction)'
is used either nominally (at-c'il-ad-eb-i 'decimaK fraction)s') or
adjectivally (at-c'il-ad-i ricxv-eb-i 'decimal numbers');
-ebr-i: this is simply an adjective based on adverbs formed by the
postposition -ebr suffixed to the Genitive (e.g. t'alg-is-ebr-i 'wave-like'
<= t'alga 'wave'). This is a basically adjectival suffix whose forms are used
nominally; they seem particularly common in definitions of plants (consider
the Academy Dictionary definition for c'erc'a 'Caucasian honeysuckle' =
sa+äua+1+o
averaget'an-is
bučk-i
body-GEN bush-NOMcxra+t'q'av+a-s-ebr-ta
I berian.honeysuckle-GEN-likePL.GENojax-isa
family-GEN
'an average-sized bush of the family of those like the Iberian
honeysuckle'108GEORGIANGRAMMAR-ebr-iv-i: this looks like an adjective based on an adverb in -iv, itself
attached to the postposition -ebr, but there is a problem in that no
Genitive desinence precedes the -ebr in such formations. Indeed, these
derivatives are built on forms ending in -eba, which suggests that the
correct segmentation may be -eb-r(-)iv-i, but in this case what is the
- r - ? . Examples: bun-eb(-)r(-)iv-i 'natural' <= bun(?-)eba 'nature',
sa + zog + ad+o-eb(-)r(-)iv-i 'societal' <= sa + zog + ad+o-eba 'society'.
Note also the parallel -ob(-)r(-)iv-i, though in this instance there is no
derivative in -oba to act as base (e.g. a+dg+il-ob(-)r(-)iv-i 'local' <=
a+dg+il-i 'place', na+c'il-ob(-)r(-)iv-i 'partial' <= na+c'il-i 'part', skesob(-)r(-)iv-i 'sexual' <= skes-i 'sex');
-eb-ur-i: this adjective means 'like' and is attached to a Genitive stem.
Is this the origin by syncope of the postposition -ebr 'like', or is the
development the other way with anaptyctic -u-? Examples: tav-is-ebur-i 'peculiar (= like unto itself)', which is very common in the Adverbial
tav-is-eb-ur-ad 'in X's own way' (cf. tav-is-eb-ur-eba 'peculiarity') <=
tav-i 'head; self', jač'v-is-eb-ur-i 'chain-like' <= jač'v-i 'chain', rk-iseb-ur-i 'horn-like' <= rka 'horn', cix-is-eb-ur-i 'fort-like' <= cixe 'fort',
nagm-is-eb-ur-i 'mine-like' <= nagm-i '(exploding) mine', čem-eb-ur-i
'of mine', cf. the common Adverbial of such pronominal-based forms čemeb-ur-ad 'in my way');
-el-i: a very common suffix for human ethnonyms; it is frequently used
nominally (e.g. inglis-el-i mo+mger+al-i 'English singer' vs inglis-el-i
'Englishman', kart+v-el-i 'GEORGIAN(human)', m+egr-el-i 'Mingrelian
(human)', amerik'-el-i 'American (human)'; N.B. tx-el-i 'thin' vs si-tx-e
'fluid'). Not all human ethnonyms are so formed (e.g. rus-i 'Russian
(human)', svan-i 'Svan (human)', apxaz-i 'Abxazian (human)', prang-i
'French (human)', berjen-i 'Greek (human)', somex-i 'Armenian (human)');
-eul-i: built on possessive pronominal stems or the Genitive of proper
names (including 'mother' and 'father'), the resulting adjective is often little
more than the Genitive of the (pro)nominal root. It may be thought of as
meaning 'having belonged to/deriving (sometimes inherited) from ROOT', e.g.
jm-eb-s
mam-is-eul-i
kon+eba
brother-PL-DAT father-GEN-inherited.from-AGR
property(NOM)
ga-(Ø-)u-q'v-i-a-t
PREV-(3rd.PER-)OV-divide-PERF-it-PL

tkven-eul-i
teps'-i
ga-m-i-t'q'd-a
your(PL)-AGR plate-NOM PREV-me-OV-break-it(AOR)
'the plate you owned broke on me'NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY109Attached directly to stems it signifies 'made of' and often forms
(collective) nouns (e.g. sp'ilenj-eul-i 'made of copper' <= sp'ilenj-i
'copper', p'ur-eul-i 'grain, cereals' <= p'ur-i 'wheat; bread', marcvl-eul-i
'grain (collective)' <= marcval-i '(individual) grain'; N.B. ert-eul-i 'unit' <=
ert-i T; with other cardinals it means 'group of NUMBER' as in švid-euli 'group of 7'; there is even gir+s-eul-i 'worthy' <= gir-s 'it is worth', i.e. a
verb-form);
-ian-i: this is a very productive suffix meaning 'possessing ROOT' (e.g.
xml-ian-i 'armed with sword' <= xmal-i 'sword', or-sa+rt+ul-ian-i '2storeyed' <= or-i '2' + sa+rt+ul-i 'storey', rj-ian-i 'milky' <= rje 'milk', orc'l-ian-i 'of 2 years' <= or-i '2' + c'el-i 'year', boč'k'o-ian-i 'fibrous' <=
boč'k'o 'fibre'). Note the noun adam+ian-i 'human being';
-ier-i dissimilates to -iel-i if there is an -r- in the root. Again the
meaning of the derivative is 'possessed of ROOT' (e.g. s i n d i s - i e r - i
'honourable' <= sindis-i 'conscience', na+q'op-ier-i 'fruitful, productive' <=
na+q'op-i 'fruit, product', xorc-iel-i 'corporeal' <= xorc-i 'flesh, meat').
N.B. mšven+ier-i 'beautiful' => mšven+ivr-ad 'beautifully' (cf. sindisier-ad 'honourably'), bed+n-ier-i 'lucky' <= bed-i 'fate', gem+r-iel-i
'tasty' <= gemo 'taste';
-iv-i: this is another case of an adjective derived from an adverb, this
time in -iv (e.g. xan+grj+1-iv-i 'long-lasting' <= xan-i 'time' + grj+el-i
'long', mudm-lv-i 'permanent');
- i t - i : in this instance we have an adjective derived from the
Instrumental case in -it. All the names of the grammatical cases are so
formed inGEORGIAN,as are a number of other grammatical terms (e.g.
saxel+ob-it-i 'Nominative' <= saxel-i 'name', mi+c+em-it-i 'Dative' <=
m i - c - e m - a 'giving', na + tes + a + o b - i t - i 'Genitive' <= na + t e s + a v - i
'relation', k'itx+v-it-i 'interrogative' <= k'itx-v-a 'asking', c'ar+mat'+ebit-i 'successful' <= c'ar+mat'+eb-a 'success');
—il—i: this suffix is most widely attested as a formant for Past Participles
(4.9.5), but it is also attested in some ordinary adjectives (e.g. tb-il-i 'warm'
=> tb-il-is-i 'Tbilisi = the place of something warm', t'k'b-il-i 'sweet
(ADJ)' => t'k'b-il-eul-i 'sweet (NOUN)');
-(n)del-i/-andel-i/indel-i: these variants form adjectives from
expressions of time (e.g. šaršan-del-i 'of last year' <= šaršan 'last year',
exla-ndel-i 'of now' <= exla 'now', i+m+dro-indeH 'of that time' <= i+m
dro-s 'at that time', c'1+ev-andel-i 'of this year' <= (a+m) c'el-s/c'leul-s 'this year');
-i+ur-i: this is an adjective in -ur-i preceded by -iv (e.g. c'l-i+ur-i
'yearly' <= c'el-i 'year', c-i+ur-i 'of the sky/heaven' <= ca 'sky/heaven',
tv-i+ur-i 'monthly; (menstrual) period' <= tve 'month');110GEORGIANGRAMMAR-oden-i/-oden+a
(Genitive - o d e n + a-s(a)): this produces an
adjective attached to a Genitive-base meaning 'the size of BASE' (e.g. iot'is-oden-i gan+sxva+v+eba 'an iota's/iota-size difference', n e m s - i s oden+a č'uč'rut'ana 'a crack the size of a needle');
- o v a n - i : this is another suffix producing derivatives meaning
'possessed of ROOT' (e.g. k'ld-ovan-i 'rocky' <= k'lde 'rock', k'utx-ovani 'angular' <= k'utxe 'corner, angle', mcire+c'l-ovan-i 'of tender years' <=
mcire 'slight' + c'el-i 'year'). Note the noun xel+ovan-i 'artist' <= xel-i
'hand';
-osan-i: yet another variant for saying 'possessed of ROOT' (e.g.
p'at'i-osan-i 'honourable, respectable' <= p'at'iv-i 'honour, respect'). A
number of derivatives are used nominally (e.g. xel-osan-i 'artisan' <= xel-i
'hand', ǰvar-osan-i 'crusader' <= ǰvar-i 'cross', and of course the title of
the national epic vepx+is+t'q'a-osan-i 'he who is possessed of the skin
of a panther = The Man in the Panther-skin' <= vepx(v)-i 'panther' +
t'q'av-i 'skin, pelt');
-u: usually this privative formant is the prefixai part of a circumfix (see
below in this section), but in q'r-u 'deaf it seems to be used suffixally and
alone (cf. q'ur-i 'ear');
-ur-i dissimilates to -ul-i if there is an -r in the root. This is the
non-human equivalent for ethnonyms, but it has a wider function than this
(e.g. inglis-ur-i (jagl-i) 'English (dog)', kart-ul-i 'GEORGIAN(thing)',
amerik'-ul-i 'American (thing)', prang-ul-i 'French (thing)', berjn-ul-i
'Greek (thing)', somx-ur-i 'Armenian (thing)', bazr-ul-i 'market-' <=
bazar-i 'market', jagl-ur-i 'doggish' <= jagl-i 'dog', mama-k'ac-ur-i
'manly' <= mama 'father' + k'ac-i 'man'). We seem to have the suffix in
some nouns (e.g. určx+ul-i 'dragon');
a- —il—I: this perhaps one-time circumfix is fossilised in a few words
like the adjective a+dv+il-i 'easy', apparently built on the root -dv- 'put',
though, as this division is no longer felt, it is not always signalled
elsewhere in this book, and the noun a+dg + il-i 'place', built on the
common root -dg- 'stand';
m - -an-i: this appears to be another fossil, seen in m+suk+an-i 'fat'
(cf. ga-suk-eb-a 'fatten');
m - -ar-i dissimilates to -al-i if there is an -r- in the root. We have
already seen this as a Prešent Participle formant whose products are
substantivised as agent-nouns. It also forms regular adjectives (e.g. m did-ar-i 'rich' <= did-i 'big', m-tav-ar-i 'main' <= tav-i 'head');
me—e: in addition to forming agent-nouns from nominal roots, this is
the circumfix, as we know from 3.2.3.2, for forming ordinal numerals.
mo- -o: this is equivalent to English '-ish'. It is especially common withNON-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY111colour-terms. Note the changes in the stem in some of the examples (e.g.
mo-lurj-o 'bluish' <= lurj-i 'blue', mo-mc'van-o 'greenish' <= mc'vane
'green', mo-c'ital-o 'reddish' <= c'itel-i 'red', mo-q'vital-o 'yellowish' <=
q'vitel-i 'yellow', mo-vard+is+pr-o 'pinkish' <= vard+ts+per-i 'pink (=
rose-coloured)', m o - m c r - o 'smallish' <= m c i r e 'slight', m o - t ' k ' b - o
'sweetish' <= tVb+il-i 'sweet', mo-grj-o 'longish' <= grj+el-i 'long');
sa- -e: this suffix was prešented above as marking the place
designated for the nominal root. Such derivatives may also have adjectival
function, as when English would utilise the hyphen to mark a noun
functioning adjectivally (e.g. rje 'milk' => sa-rje+v-e k'b+il-i/jirk'val-i
'milk-tooth/gland', navt-i 'oil' => sa-navt-e 'oil-container' vs sa-navt-e
č'a 'oil-well', muraba 'jam' => sa-murab-e kila 'jam-jar', nagm-i 'mine' =>
sa-nagm-e vel-i 'mine-field'; še-vs-eb-a 'filling' => sa-vs-e 'full');
sa- -o: this is virtually synonymous with the previous circumfix in
terms of its adjective-forming function (e.g. r a z m - i 'regiment' => s a razm-o 'regimental', imed-i 'hope' => sa-imed-o 'hopeful', m+xed+ar-i
'cavalier, soldier' => s a - m + x e d + r - o 'military', xipat-i 'danger' => s a xipat-o 'dangerous', m + g l o v + iare 'mourner' => s a - m + glov + iar-o
'mourning (ADJ)', me+cn+ier-i 'scientist, scholar' => sa-me+cn + ier-o
'scientific, scholarly');
u- -o: this is the exceedingly common privative circumfix (e.g. pex-i
'leg, foot' => u-pex-o 'legless', xel-i 'hand' => u-xel-o 'handless', cf. u xel-pex-o 'without hands or legs', mze 'sun' => u-mze-o 'sunless', mank'
-i 'stain, defect' => u-mank'-o 'innocent, stainfree', xma 'voice' => u-xm-o
'voiceless', kmar-i 'husband' => u-kmr-o 'husbandless', mizez-i 'cause' =>
u-mizez-o 'without cause', bral-i 'fault' => u-bral-o 'ordinary'; N.B. the
substantivised u+dab+n+o 'wilderness' <= daba 'hamlet'); N.B. u - k m - e
'work-free, rest-', for which we also have u-km-i, though this latter more
often means 'useless, lazy';
u- -ur-i dissimilates to -ul-i if there is an -r- in the root. This is a
less frequent privative circumfix (e.g. gun+eba 'mood, disposition' => u gun-ur-i 'stupid', sa+km+e 'business, work, job' => u - s a + k m - u r - i 'idle',
g e m o 'taste' => u - g e m - u r - i 'tasteless', per-i 'colour' => u - p e r - u l - i
'colourless').
By suffixing the noun per-i 'colour' to the Genitive of an appropriate
noun one produces an adjective signifying 'NOUN-coloured' (e.g. portoxali 'orange (NOUN)' => portoxl-ls-per-i 'orange(-coloured)', ca 'sky' => cis-per-i 'azure, sky-coloured').
By suffixing either -nair-i or gvar-i to roots one produces adjectives
meaning 'ROOT-like' (e.g. mraval-nair-i/mraval-gvar-i 'multiform' <=
mraval-i 'several', sxva-nair-i/sxva-gvar-i 'different (= other-like)' <=112GEORGIANGRAMMARsxva 'other', r a - n a i r - i / r a - g v a r - i ? 'of what sort?', e r t - n a i r - i / e r t gvar-i 'alike' <= ert-i T, or-nair-i/or-gvar-i 'of 2 types' <= or-i '2',
nair=nair-i 'of varied types'). With pronouns -nair-i may be used with
possessive stems (e.g. čfem-nair-i 'like me', a+m-nair-i 'like this, such',
mag-nair-i 'like that', i+m-nair-i 'like that (yonder)'). In fact, this suffix
is today freely attached to Genitives with the expected meaning (e.g. bibliis-nair-i = bibli-is m+s+g+av+s-i 'Bible-like'). An adjective again
meaning 'ROOT-like' is produced by attaching -tan+a 9 ; it is more
restricted than the previous suffix, being used especially with pronominal
stems, which, unlike the previous case, end in the Genitival -is- (e.g. čemis-tan+a 'like me', a+m-is-tan+a 'like this', m-is-tan+a 'like X, suchlike',
tkven-is-tan+a 'like you(Pl)').
Adjectives are sometimes built on postpositional phrases (e.g. ujredšoris-i 'intercellular' <= ujred-i 'cell' + šoris 'between, among', sa+rt+ulšoris-i 'inter-storey' <= sa + rt + ul-i 'storey'; c e n t ' r - i s - k ' e n - u l - i
'centripetal' <= cent'r-i 'centre' + -k'en 'towards' + -ul-i, cent'r-i+danul-i 'centrifugal' with -i + dan 'from', c x v i r - i s - m i e r - i 'nasal (e.g.
consonant)' <= cxvir-i 'nose' + mier 'by'), šua-tan+a 'medium, average' is
simply produced by combining postposition with suffix.
There are cases where finite verb-forms have given rise to adjectives
(e.g. g+i+a 'open', which is an old stative form from the verbal root seen in
the Masdar ga-g-eb-a 'opening'; u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant' comes from v (Ø-)-i-c-i 'I know (it)' with privative prefix).
Reduplication also has a role to play.
We have already met
nair=nair-i 'of different types', and others can be formed to convey the
notion 'very/quite ADJ' (e.g. msxvil=msxvil-i 'very/quite thick'). Another
way of emphasising the extent to which a quality applies is to repeat the
positive form of the adjective, the first having -ze 'on; than' suffixed to it
(e.g. cxad-ze cxad-i(-a) '(it is) as plain as can be/totally manifest' <=
cxad-i 'clear, plain'). By reduplicating cardinals one produces distributive
numerals (e.g. or=or-i '2 each', as = as-i '100 each'). By combining
consecutive cardinals one produces the equivalent of 'x or x+1' (e.g. sami=otx-i '3 or 4'). Note mavan-i da mavan-i 'this and that' 10 (as in:
mavan-i

"5Syntax5.Ø General Syntax
OnceGEORGIANverbal morphology has been mastered, the syntax of the
language is reasonably straightforward. Its subordinate clauses, unlike
those of North Caucasian languages, do not differ markedly from the
familiar structures of typical Indo-European languages with their use of
conjunctions plus interplay of indicative and subjunctive finite verb-forms.
However, so that those interested in syntax can approach this chapter
without necessarily having to work through all the detail prešented in the
preceding chapters (especially Chapter 4), I now include a short resumé of
the non-syntactic component ofGEORGIANgrammar.

When used as nouns, they decline according to the noun-pattern prešented
above. When qualifying a noun, the adjective stands first. As the noun
declines, a vowel-final adjective remains unchanged in both singular and
plural, whereas a consonant-final adjective manifests the following
agreement-pattern:NOMINATIVE

ADVERBIAlSingular/Plural

-ØIn some older texts variations may be found: for example, a consonantfinal adjective may end in -is when coupled with either a Genitive or
Instrumental noun, and in -s with a Dative noun; alternatively such an
adjective may lack an ending altogether with a Genitive noun.
Numerals
The system from '11' to '19' is analysable as '10-UNIT-more'. From '2Ø' to
'99' the system is based on units of twenty (i.e. it is vigesimal), so that, for
example, '55' is literally '2-times-2Ø-and-(1Ø-5-more)', Any adjective that
states a quantity, such as a cardinal numeral, is prescriptively conjoined
with the singular form of the noun.
Pronouns
1st and 2nd person pronouns remain unchanged for the cases used to
encode the verb's main arguments (viz. Nominative, Dative, Ergative). The
3rd person pronoun reflects some older features, with its Ergative Singular525SYNTAX
in -n and a reduced plural, e.g.","[541, 542, 543, 544]"

(kal-t(a) maġal-t(a) brmat(a))The language did not shift suddenly from the old pattern of postposed
adjective in full agreement with its head to preposed adjectives manifesting
the partial agreement (sc. for consonant-final adjectives) characterising the
literary language today, as illustrated above.
Georgian literature up to
the early 20th century reveals slight variant-patterns for consonant-final
attributive adjectives, which are now described.
A Dative noun may
produce agreement in its epithet (e.g. maġal-s kaHeb-)s(a)). This same
form of the adjective may be attested alongside a noun in the Adverbial
(e.g. maġal-s kaHeb-)ad(a)), and it is perhaps to be regarded as more
normal than the bare stem when a possessive adjective (see 3.2.5) is
construed with Dative and Adverbial nouns (e.g. čem(-s) da-s my(-AGR)
sister-DAT 'to my sister'; šen(-s) megobr-ad your(-AGR) friend-ADV 'as
your friend'). A Genitive head equally may impose its desinence on its
attribute (e.g. maġl-is kaHeb-)is(a)). This same form of the adjective
was also possible alongside a noun in the Instrumental (e.g. maġl-is kal(eb-)it(a)). Two further innovations in agreement-patterning may be
noted: according to Shanidze (1973:84), the first is for the bare stem of the
adjective (e.g. maġal) alone to be used for all cases of the head-noun other
than the Nominative and Vocative. This development, of course, bringsNON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY47consonant-final adjectives more into line with vowel-final adjectives,
where, as we have seen, there is no agreement today at all. The second,
styled as 'vulgar' in The Norms of the Modern Georgian Literary
Language (1986:132, in Georgian), is for an adjective to keep throughout
its declension the same form that it manifests in agreement with Nominative
nouns (viz. maġal-i). This would produce an exact parallel with Georgian's
largest sister-language, Mingrelian, and, according to The Norms, this
option is indeed restricted to some Western dialects.
Nouns indicating professions could be interpreted as virtual attributive
adjectives when used in conjunction with a person's surname. In these
circumstances a consonant-final attribute follows the following pattern for
the expression 'President Zhordania':

p'rezident' žordanias(a)
p'rezident' žordania-ti
p 'reziden t ' žordan ia -d(a)This pattern clearly differs somewhat from those already presented,
and it is the one that is followed by expressions of the type kalak-i
tbilis-i 'the city (of) Tbilisi'. In some older types of phrase, where the
profession or, in reference to sovereigns, their number follows a Christian
name, the word designating the profession (or number) declines, whilst the
Christian name appears in its root-form only (e.g. 'Gaioz the Rector' in the
Nominative and Ergative cases would be gaioz rekt'or-i vs g a i o z
rekt'or-ma, 'George I' would similarly be giorgi p'irvel-i vs giorgi
p'irvel-ma; equally 'Queen Tamar' would be tamar me+p+e vs tamar
me+p + e-m). A parallel to this is what happens when Christian and
surnames are given together: the Christian name stays in its root-form,
whilst the surname declines. Under Russian influence the patronymic
system was introduced (with je for 'son' and asul-i for 'daughter'); if used,
the patronymic too will not decline before the surname (e.g. the Nominative
and Ergative of 'Zviad (son of K'onst'ant'ine) Gamsaxurdia' would be zviad
(k'onst'ant'ine-s je) gamsaxurdia vs zviad (k'onst'ant'ine-s je)
gamsaxurdia-m). In those rare instances when the reverse ordering is
followed, the following paradigm is observed (with gaps in the Instrumental
and Adverbial):48GEORGI AN GRAMMARCase

There are two formations: the older synthetic pattern vs the newer
analytic.
The analytic may apply without exception to any adjective in the
language. To produce the comparative grade the adverb u+pr+o 'more' is
placed before the positive form of the adjective, e.g.

Combinations of real protasis with unreal apodosis (or vice versa) are
normally regarded as solœcisms, such as, for example, the English '(?) If
you were to come, I shall be glad'. Collocations of this latter sort in
GEORGIAN,however, are quite common. The protasis consists of rom +
Aorist SUBJunctive, whilst the apodosis contains the Future Indicative, e.g.

This coupling of the conditional markers, always in this order, is not

'on condition', whilst the subordinate clause begins with the complementiser588GEORGIANGRAMMARrom 'that' accompanied by the Future Indicative for future reference or

For reference to the future the main verb here would be da-tan+xmd-eb-i-an 'they will agree', whilst the subordinate verb would become
mo-(Ø-)u-va 'it will come to him'.
5.2.2.1.5 Concession
Esšentially there are two conjunctions that mark concession: tu+mc(a)
'although' is found with non-SUBJunctive verbs, whilst tu+nd(+a(+c)) 'even
if' is principally used in association with the Prešent SUBJunctive for
prešent concessions, with the Aorist SUBJunctive for future concessions, or
with the Pluperfect Indicative for past concessions. The latter conjunction
is analysable as tu 'if', the modal particle u+nd+a 'it is necessary', and -c
'even', which element occurs on a number of subordinating conjunctions and
pronouns to distinguish them from their interrogative variants—sometimes
this clitic attaches to some other word within the clause rather than to the
concessive conjunction itself. In addition to tu, the former conjunction
contains the now obsolete formant -mc(a), whose role in OldGEORGIANwas
to lend a šense of non-factuality to the indicative with which it was
construed. Examples:

A non-finite reprešentation employs the adposition mi+u+xed+av+ad
'disregarding, despite', which is the Adverbial case of the Privative
Participle of the verb mi+xed+v+a 'behold, look thither, look to', in
association with the Genitive of the 3rd person deictic demonstrative
pronoun acting as cataphor to a noun-clause introduced by rom, e.g.

5.2.2.1.6 Manner
The simplest construction has ro+gor+c 'as' (cf. interrogative ro+gor?
'how?') introducing an indicative verb, the order of the two clauses being
irrelevant, e.g.
ro+gor+c
šen
g-e-p'rian-eb-a,
as
you(DAT) you-IOV-appeal-TS-it
mo-(Ø-)i-kec-i
PREV-(you-)PASS-act-AOR.INDIC(=I MPER)
'Act as the fancy takes you'i+s + e
soIf the correlative is i + m + gvar + ad(-ve) 'in (just) that way', the
manner-clause will be introduced by ro+gor+ada+c, whilst a parallel
correlative-conjunctional coupling is i+m+nair+ad(-ve)...ra+nair+ada+c.
If the above reprešent factual clauses of manner, the situation is
somewhat different in the case of hypothetical manner-clauses. The
subordinating conjunction is t+i+tk+o(+s) 'as if, as though', which derives
from tu i+tkv+a 'if it was/is said' or tu i+tkv+a+s 'if it transpires that it
is said'. The conjunction permits three constructions: (a) the verb will be in
that tense of the indicative which is appropriate to the demands of the
main verb; (b) the Prešent SUBJunctive may replace the Prešent Indicative if59ØGEORGIANGRAMMARthe main verb is non-past, whilst the III rd SUBJunctive may replace an
Aorist Indicative or Perfect that would have occurred in the putative
original direct speech, regardless of the tense of the main verb; (c) given
the prešence of a form of the verb 'say' within the conjunction, the clause
may reflect the reporting of original speech (or thought) by coupling the
speech-particle -o with the words originally spoken (or thought), e.g.

r(+)o+de+sa+c and r(+)o+ca 'when' (cf. interrogative r( + )o + di+s?
'when?'), either of which will stand at the start of a clause containing an
indicative verb, e.g.
r(+)o+de+sa+c / / r(+)o+ca mo-x-val,
šen-i

'When you come, bring your sister too'
Examples may also be found of causal ra+k'i and manner ro+gor
appearing in contexts where it seems more appropriate to translate them
as 'when'.
The general subordinator rom is frequently used, especially in speech,
in a temporal šense, so that the subordinate clause in the above-example
could be replaced by:
šen / /

"NON-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY115Notes
1Historically the -s was the Genitive singular added to a stem ending in -e. For the
analysis see Mač'avariani (1959).
2 It has been suggested that this is an importation from Old Armenian, where the ending
is normal for the Instrumental case of i-stem nouns (e.g. ban-iw 'by/with/through
word'). This hypothesis perhaps accounts for the šense in which the ending -iv is
used inGEORGIAN,but it fails to explain why this borrowing should have capitalised on
the Instrumental desinence only for Armenian i-stem nouns when no such borrowing
seems to have taken place from the more common Armenian a-stems (e.g. a m - a w
'by/with/through year'; Yisous ašakert-aw-k h -n iwr-ov-k h gnac h Jesus(NOM)
disciple-INST-Pl-the
his-INST-Pl
he.departed 'Jesus left with his disciples'), unless
k'vla+v 'again' is to be so analysed. The only alternative explanation I have seen
supposes that originally the particle -ve was suffixed to the citation-form of the
adjective or participle and that in time the word-final e-vowel was lost by apocope.
This proposal, however, as far as I can see, completely fails to account for the
meaning of the forms in -iv.
3 Or Dative perhaps?
4 vidre (cf. 5.2.3.1) may also be used with the object of comparison, which in such
instances stands in the same case as the entity with which it is being compared (e.g.
i+s upro did-i-a vidre e+s that(NOM) more big-NOM-is than this(NOM 'that one is
bigger than this one').
5 Discussing a parallel phenomenon in Mingrelian, namely net'e go-m-o-k'et-eb-apu-ni =GEORGIANnet'avi (rom (- -ni)) ga-m-a-k'et-eb-in-a 'Would that X
made/were to make me do it', K'iziria (1982:89) comments: 'the trivalent verb has
become bivalent; as subject is the noun placed in the Dative.' In other words, he
views the pronominal element - m - , which correlates with a notionally Dative 1st
person singular pronoun outside the verb (here unexpressed), as the subject. I find
this a rather extreme analysis in view of the fact that surely we may simply add to the
Mingrelian g o r o n t - k (and I suspect g m e r t - m a to theGEORGIAN)'God-ERG'
(historically speaking at least this is the Ergative case in Mingrelian) to make explicit
the true subject that is left understood in most cases, cf. the followingGEORGIAN
phrase with this subject actually prešent alongside the Aorist Indicative gmert-ma
î?0-)g-i-švel-a, which expresses the wish 'May God help you!'. Tuite (1991.150)
accepts K'iziria's view in his discussion of theGEORGIANphenomenon.
6 Cf. the use of -u plus an indicative verb in Svan today. See also 5.2.2.1.1.
7 An exact parallel exists in Mingrelian g-a-lu-ap-u-k =GEORGIANg-e-vl-eb-i, from
which the Adverbial case of the Past Participle is g o - l u - a p - i r - o , as in the
expression skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o čkim-i dud-i 'may my head be your encircled',
so that skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o is used much likeGEORGIANg-e-na+cva(l-e), cf. also
kә-go-r-lu-ap-e-d-a-k! =GEORGIANäe-mo-g-vl-eb-od-e! 'may I encircle you!'.
In Abkhaz we s-wә-k'ә+x+әa-x[a]-aa+yt' 'may I encircle you(MASC)' or 5-wәk'ә+x+sa-w+p' 'I am your(MASC) encircler = darling', cf. yә-wә-x-sa s-a-g[a]ša+yt' 'let what may befall you(MASC) carry me off!': if one were to address these
expressions to a woman, the - w ә - would be replaced by - b ә - . N.B. the underlined
sibilant reprešents retroflex articulation.
8 Aorist i-jr-a, Perfect Jr-ul-a. Cf. mic'+is-jvr+a 'earthquake'.
9 Presumably the suffix is analysable as the posposition -tan, here though governing the
Genitive, plus the adjective-formant -a; when used nominally the Genitive is in -a-s.
10 As a general term of address we have the Vocative, as in: s'en, m a v a n - o ,

'you are in the grip of a yearning for X/them',
which is limited to the Prešent Sub-Series.
The verb in -il-ob is exceptional according to the standards of the
pattern just examined. It is (Ø-Ø-)cd-il-ob 'you try (to do something)',
which in the Future Sub-Series and in Series II becomes the bivalent
prefixal Intransitive Verb (še-)(Ø-Ø-)e-cd-eb-i vs Aorist (še-)(Ø-Ø-)ecad-e, where we note the optionality of the preverb, (e.g. gogo (še-)
(Ø-)e-cad-a tval-eb-i ga-(Ø-)e-xil-a 'the girl tried to open her eyes').
Alongside this Intransitive Aorist we also find the Transitive (Ø-Ø-)?scad-e (e.g. gogo-m (Ø-)?s-cad-a tval-eb-i ga-(Ø-)e-xil-a 'the girl
tried to open her eyes'). Again in Series III we have a choice between
Intransitive and Transitive forms: the peculiarity of the Intransitive verb is
that, though it is formally monovalent, it may take a Dative object (e.g.
zaza ar-c ( š ) ( ? Ø - ) c d - i l - a m-is da+mšvid+eb+a-s = zaza ar-c
(še-)(?Ø-)cd-il-a i+s da-(Ø-)e-mšvid-eb-in-a = zaza-s ar-c (Ø-)

da-(Ø-)e-mšvid-eb-in-a 'neither did Zaza try to calm X'). Participles
are: Active m-cd-el-i, Future sa-cd-el-i, Past na-cad-i.
4.1Ø.1 Version as Screeve-marker
We have already met Medials with an indirect object of the type (Ø-)hq'araul-ob 'you guard X/them' where in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series II the indirect object is marked by the Objective Version (viz. (Ø?Ø-Ø-)u-q'araul-eb 'you will guard X/them') such that the appearance of
the versioniser helps (along with the change of Thematic Suffix) to
demarcate the screeve. There are a few Transitive Verbs where the
introduction of a versioniser alone differentiates Prešent from Future SubSeries.
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)vn-eb 'you inflict harm on X/them' (cf. ma-vn-e 'harmful,
malignant') in the Future takes the locative Version and becomes (Ø-?ØØ-)a-vn-eb (Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-vn-e, Perfect g-i-vn-i-a -tvis) (e.g.
nadir-ma ar (?Ø-Ø-)a-vn-o-s šorena-s 'may the prey do no harm to
Shorena').
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)rg-eb 'you bring benefit to X/them' (cf. ma-rg-eb-el-i with
syncopating - e - 'benign, beneficial', sa-rg-eb-1-oba 'benefit', (Ø-?Ø-)
sa+rg+eb+l-ob/(Ø-?Ø-)i-sa+rg+eb+l-eb 'you (will) take advantage of

(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rg-un-eb 'you (will) allot X/them to Y/them', (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)arg-eb 'you (will) use X/them for the benefit of Y/them', g-e-rg-eb-a 'it494GEORGIANGRAMMARfalls to your lot' => Aorist g-e-rg-o => Perfect g-rg-eb-i-a, or in the
Prešent Sub-Series only 'it belongs to you', ( š e - ) g - e - r g - e b - a 'X
brings/will bring you benefit' 273 , (mo-)g-e-rg-eb-a 'it fits/will fit you',
(mo-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-rg-eb 'you (will) make X/them fit Y/them') similarly forms
its Future with the locative Version to give (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-rg-eb => Aorist
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-rg-e, Perfect g-i-rg-i-a -tvis.
(Ø-?Ø-)h-k'b-en 'you bite X/them' (cf. k'b+il-i 'tooth', m-k'b-en(ar-)i/m-k'b-en-ar-a 'biting' 274 , (Ø-)i-k'b-in-eb-i 'you bite' only in the
Prešent Sub-Series, t'uč-s/ena-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-k'b-en 'you (will) bite
yourself on the lip/tongue' 275 ) is transformed into the Future by the
introduction of the Objective Version (viz. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-k'b-en 276 => Aorist
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-k'b-in-e => Perfect g-i-k'b-en-i-a -tvis).
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)čkmet' = dialectal (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)p'c'k'-en = 'you pinch X/them'

forms respectively.
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)čxvlet' 'you prick/poke X/them' similarly has the Future
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-čxvlet' => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-čxvlit'-e => Perfect g-ičxvlet'-i-a -tvis, though a regular set of paradigms also seems to exist,
formed, according to KEGl, by treating the verb as a simple Root Verb
with preverb da- in the perfective screeves, viz. Future d a - ( Ø Ø-)(5xvlet' => Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)(?xvlit'-e => Perfect da-g-i-čxvlet'i-a—cf. in the Prešent Sub-Series only (m)č'val-i g-čxvlet'-s 'you have
an attack of stitch' (vs (m)č'val-i g-a-dg-a-s 'you have stitch').
(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)rk-en 'you butt X/them' (cf. rka 'horn') has Future (Ø-?ØØ-)u-rk-en, Aorist (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-rk-in-e, Perfect g-i-rk-en-i-a -tvis.
4.10.2 Honorifics
GEORGIANhas a number of verb-forms which are used when the speaker is
being exceptionally polite towards his interlocutor.
'Be' (2nd/3rd person subject)
GEORGIANis like a number of European languages in using the 2nd person
plural form of a verb for polite address. And so, for the copula we have,
for example, ro+gora x-a+r? 'how are you' as the familiar form vs
ro+gora x-a+r-t? as a more formal question (obligatory, of course, when
addressing more than one person). However, for an even greater level of
politeness we have ro+gor (Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t?. This preverblessVERBAl MORPHOlOGY495Intransitive form of the root is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, and
the Prešent Subjunctive is common in the parting-expression k'arg-ad
(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-od-e-t! 'Be well!'. The verb-form is also found, if less
commonly, with 2nd person singular and 3rd person subject (e.g.
msaxur+t+u+x+u+c+es-i vardan dadian-i brjan-d-eb-a 'the Chief
of Domestic Staff is Vardan Dadiani').
'Be' (lst/3rd person subject)
The Stative Verb (Ø-)a-xl-av-s (Past = Imperfect (Ø-)a-xl-d-a, Perfect
(Ø-)xl-eb-i-a) 'X is in attendance upon Y' (cf. a+xl+o(+s) 'near', ( m o - /
mi-)(Ø-Ø-)u-a+xl+o-v-d-eb-i 'you (will) approach X/them') is used to
shew respect to the person being addressed. Examples: inglis+el-i g-axl-av-[v-ja+r-t (lit. 'I, an Englishman, attend you(Pl.)') for inglis+el-i
v-a+r 'I am English'; i+m dro-s tb+il+is-ši g-a-xl-d-i-t 'at that time I
was in Tbilisi' for tb+il+is-ši v-i-q'av-i; e+s čem-i da g-a-xl-av-t
'this is my sister' for e+s čem-i da a+r-i(-s)/da-a; i + s + i + n-i
kart+v+el-eb-i g-a-xl-av-an 'those areGEORGIANs';zaza london-ši
g-a-xl-d-a-t 'Zaza was in london'. Cf. m-xl-eb-el-i (with syncopating
vowel) 'attendant'.
An alternative to the greeting ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-marj-o-s 'Greetings to X
(Dative)!' is v-a-xl-av-[v-ja+r (+ Dative) when one arrives somewhere.
Also formed from this root is the dynamic verb (Ø-Ø-)e-a+xl-eb-i277 'you
go to attend/visit X/them; you go with X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-a+xel-i
and with 3rd person singular subject (Ø-Ø-)e-a+xl-a, Perfect (Ø-Ø-)xleb-i-x-a+r, where we see that the stative and dynamic III rd Series
screeves fall together) (e.g. vai, ro+gor da-(Ø-)ber-d-i,
šen-c
si+ber+e g-xl-eb-i-a! 'Alas, how old you have grown, old age has
evidently paid you a visit too!').
'Motion' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root that serves as an honorific copula when preverbless, namely
-brjan-, when endowed with a preverb expressing direction becomes an
honorific for the basic verb of motion (e.g. mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t 'you
(will) come' => Aorist mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, Perfect mo-(Ø-)brjan-ebul-x-a+r-t). It is particularly common in asking questions (e.g. sad mi(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t? 'where are you going?) and in issuing commands (e.g.
mi-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, g-txov-t 'After you, please' = 'Go thither, I beg
you'). When the preverb is da-, the meaning of the verb-form is 'sit down',
whilst with a- the meaning is 'stand up'.","[511, 512, 513, 514]"
"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY4974.10.3 Variable Actant Marking
The root -)in-, construed with either da- or c'a- as preverb, can be used
in two ways to convey the concept of 'going to sleep': the verb can be
formally Transitive, as in bavšv-ma t'k'b+il-ad ča-(?Ø-)i-)in-a 'the
child fell sweetly to sleep' (=> Perfect bavšv-s ča-(Ø-)u-)in-i-a), or
alternatively the root may take the shape of an Indirect Verb, as in
baväv-s t'k'b+il-ad ča-(Ø-)e-)in-a 'the child fell sweetly to sleep' (=>
Perfect bavšv-s ča-s-)in-eb-i-a). Similarly the antonym -gvij-, with
either ga- or ga-mo- as preverb, can be construed either Transitively or
as an Indirect Verb in the meaning 'wake up/sober up' (e.g. b a v š v - m a
xma+ur+oba-ze ga-(mo-)(?Ø-)i-gvij-a 'the child woke at the noise' (=>
Perfect baväv-s ga-(mo-)(Ø-)u-gvij-(n-)i-a) = bavšv-s xma+ur+oba-ze ga-(mo-)(Ø-)e-gvij-a (=> Perfect baväv-s ga-(mo-)(Ø-)
gvij-eb-i-a).
In the case of the root -tvlem- 'snooze, slumber', although the c a š
marking of the snoozer varies in the same way as in the previous two
example-roots, the actual shape of the verb itself only varies between
Transitive and Indirect in Series III. Transitively we have: mo+x+u+c-i
(ča-)tvlem-s 'the old man is snoozing/will fall into a snooze' vs Aorist
mo+x+u+c-ma ča-(?Ø-)tvlim-a vs Perfect mo+x+u+c-s ša-(Ø-)utvlem-i-a; the alternative paradigm is: mo+x+u+c-s (ča-)(s-)tvlem-s
'the old man is snoozing/will fall into a snooze' vs Aorist mo+x+u+c-s ča(s-)tvlim-a vs Perfect mo+x+u+c-s ča-(s-)tvlem-i-a. It is difficult to
detect any difference in meaning between the three pairs from the
examples given in KEGl. However, in the case of some other verbs
describing bodily functions, it is perhaps possible to point to a semantic
distinction.
In the example cocxal-i adam+ian-i an cxvir-s da-(?Ø-?Ø-?Ø)ac-em-in-eb-s 2 7 9
an da-(?Ø-)a-mtknar-eb-s da an a-mo-(?Ø-)aslok'in-eb-s 'a living person either will sneeze or yawn or again produce
a hiccup' 28Ø .
All three verbs are formally Transitive with the
sneezer/yawner/hiccuper in the Nominative case as subject of a Transitive
Verb in the Future Indicative. If these verbs were in a Series II screeve,
the subject would be Ergative, but this is not so in the following example:
p'ap'a-s sc'ore+d a+m dro-s cxvir-s da-(?Ø-?Ø-)a-c-em-in-a 'it
was precisely at this time that the priest sneezed', where the sneezer is in
the Dative. Perhaps the context is hinting that the sneeze came at an
embarrassing moment for the priest, so that to underline the non-deliberate
nature of the act, the sneezer is made indirect object, leaving the subject
(Nature, God, Providence?) and direct object, though cross-referenced in498GEORGIANGRAMMARthe verb, actually undefined. It would follow from this that the normal
subject-marking for Transitive Verbs assigned to the noun 'person' in the
first example is to suggest that these are deliberate acts that one might
expect from 'the living person'. We can also have indirect-object marking
for yawners and hiccupers (e.g. tu jil-i mo-g-e-r-ev-a, albat da(?Ø-)g-a-mtknar-eb-?s 'if sleep gets the better of you, you will probably
yawn' vs without preverb bavSv-s mtel-i sa+gam+o (?Ø-Ø-)a-mtknar?a 'the baby had a fit of yawning the whole evening'; p'armen-s (?ØØ-)a-slok'in-?a mtel-i dge 'P'armen had an attack of the hiccups the
whole day'). Similarly for 'coughing' we have both the Transitive ekim-is
txov+n-it bavšv-ma da-(?Ø-)a-xvel-a 'at the request of the doctor
the child coughed' vs the alternative inglis+el-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)a-xvel-a,
roca araq'-ma q'el-i da-(Ø-)s-c'v-a 'the Englishman coughed when the
vodka burnt his throat'. For 'belching' it seems that only the Indirect
method is possible, as in m+s+m+el-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)a-boq'in-a 'the drinker
belched'. According to the dictionaries [KEGl and Tschenkčli), in Series
III the verbs prešented for 'sneezing', 'yawning', 'hiccuping', 'coughing' and
'belching' permit only the Transitive forms, so that the Perfects are
respectively: (da-)(Ø-)u-c-em-in-eb-i-a, (da-)(Ø-)u-mtknar-eb-i-a,
(a-mo-)(Ø-)u-slok'in-eb-i-a, d a - ( Ø - ) u - x v e l - e b - i - a , d a - ( Ø - ) u boq'in-eb-i-a. An alternative root for 'sneeze', -cxik'v-, is Transitive
throughout (viz. (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)a-cxik , v-eb 'you (will) sneeze' => Aorist
(da-)(Ø-?Ø-)a-cxik'v-e => Perfect ( d a - ) g - i - c x i k ' v - e b - i - a ) . For
'snoring' we have the Medial Verb (Ø-)xvrin-av 'you snore' => Future (Ø?Ø-)i-xvrin-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xvrin-e => Perfect g-i-xvrin-i-a.
For 'spitting' the verb is a normal Transitive, as seen in the proverb a-v(?Ø-)a-purtx-e—ulvaš-s mo-(Ø-)xvd-a, da-v-(?Ø-)a-purtx-e—
c ' v e r - e b - s a - o 'I spat upwards—it caught (my) moustache, I spat
downwards—(it caught my) beard, they say'; similarly for 'urinating'
((mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)šard-av or (mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)ps-am) and 'defalcating'
((mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)jv-am).
We have fluctuation between the direct and indirect construction with
the formally bivalent Intransitive Verb 'be worthy of', as seen in the
contrasting syntax of: ro+di+s (Ø-)e-gir+s-eb-od-nen i+s+i+n-i a+m
si+k'et+e-s, rom ar q'+op-il-i-q'+o m+c'er+al-ta k'avšir-i? 'when
would theyNOM have been worthy of this kindnessDAT. if there had not
been a union of Writers?', which construction is seen again in this quote
from Vazha Pshavela: k'ide+v v-(Ø-)e-gir+s-e ga+zapxul-s 'I again
was worthy (of seeing) the spring', but in the next quote from
C'avč'avadze the c a š m a r k i n g of the arguments is reversed: c'minda-a
i+gi, vi-sa-c (Ø-)e-gir+s-a mam+ul-is-tvis tav-is da+d+eb+a 'pureVERBAl MORPHOlOGY499is he for whomDAT the laying downNOM of his life was a worthy thing to
do*.
Another kind of fluctuation has been examined by Tuite (1987; 1993).
He points out the subtle difference between such verbal usages as: deda
bavšv-eb-s (Ø-)a-int'eres-eb-s zgap'r-eb-it 'the mother is keeping
the children interested with fairty-tales' (the plurality of the direct object
is not marked on the verb) vs bavšv-eb-s (Ø-)a-int'eres-eb-t zgap'reb-i 'the children are interested in fairy-tales' (where, he argues, the
morphological direct object is treated as the syntactic subject and thus
now does have its plurality marked on the verb). We then have in contrast
to the latter an inceptive formation: bavšv-eb-i int'eres-d-eb-i-an
zgap'r-eb-it 'the children are getting interested in fairy-tales'. In Series
III both the latter constructions are permissible for this verb, giving in the
Perfect: zgap'r-eb-s da-(Ø-)u-int'eres-eb-i-a bavšv-eb-i 'fairy-tales
have interested the children' vs bavšv-eb-i
da-int'eres-eb-ul-an
zgap'r-eb-it 'the children have become interested in fairy-tales'.
Consider now such verbs as: (da-)(Ø-)a-elm-eb-s 'X makes/will make
Y/them cross-eyed', (da-i-(Ø-)a-k'ut'-eb-s = (da-)(Ø-)a-sap'q'r-eb-s 'X
makes/will make Y/them crippled', (ga-)(Ø-)a-p'ir+kuš-eb-s 'X puts/will
put Y/them in a bad mood', (ga-)(Ø-)a-rind-eb-s 'X makes/will make
Y/them mute', (ag-)(Ø-)a-t'q'in-eb-s 'X makes/will make Y/them ecstatic',
(da-)(Ø-)a-pikr+ian-eb-s 'X makes/will make Y/them pensive', (ag-)(Ø-)
a-prt+ovan-eb-s 'X thrIIIs/will thrIII Y/them', (a-)(Ø-)a-caxcax-eb-s
'X makes/will make Y/them tremble', (mo-)(Ø-)tent-av-s 'X relaxes/will
relax Y/them'. These verbs are paralleled by Intransitive forms like: (da-)
(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i 'you (will) become cross-eyed', (da-)(Ø-)k'ut'-d-eb-i =
(da-)(Ø-)sap'q'r-d-eb-i 'you (will) become crippled', (mo-)(Ø-)i-tenteb-i 'you are being/will be relaxed' etc... Whilst one would expect both
Transitive and Intransitive paradigms to be complete across the three
screeve-series, it seems from Tuite's work that, in his words: 'speakers
appear not to regard these parallel forms as composing two separate
paradigms, but rather as elements of a single paradigm with a degree of
morphological and syntactic variability in it' (1993.6). Though speakerjudgments differ somewhat among themselves and for different verbs, Tuite
found that for the verb 'make/become cross-eyed', the Transitive
construction was preferred in the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. g-a-elm-eb-s
'X (say, watching TV) makes you cross-eyed' is better than
(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i 'you go cross-eyed (from watching TV)', with - g a n
expressing the cause), whereas in the Future Sub-Series the preference
shifted to the Intransitive variant (viz. Future da-(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i) though
the Transitive ( d a - g - a - e l m - e b - s ) is stIII acceptable; in Series II5ØØGEORGIANGRAMMARpreference for the Intransitive (Aorist da-(Ø-)elm-d-i) was so strong as
to make the Transitive (da-g-a-elm-a) questionable, whilst in Series III
only the Intransitive (Perfect da-(Ø-)elm-eb-ul-x-a+r vs Transitive da(Ø-Ø-)u-elm-eb-i-x-a+r) seemed permissible at all.
4.10.4 Similarities across the sub-types of verb
We have already seen examples where a Transitive verb (e.g. man ča(?Ø-)i-)in-a ' X E R G fell asleep') is hardly, if at all, distinguishable in šense
from an Indirect Verb (viz. ma-s ča-(Ø-)e-)in-?a ' X D A T fell asleep').
Equally there are examples where a Transitive Verb stands very close in
meaning to an Intransitive Verb (e.g. kal-ma tval-eb-i kmar-s mi-(ØØ-)a-št'er-a 'the womanERG fixed her eyes on [= stared atj (her) husband'
vs kal-i tval-eb-it mi-(Ø-)a-št'er-d-a munj-s 'the womanNOM stared
with (her) eyes at the dumb one'; mxar-s da-(Ø-)g-i-čer 'I'll support you
(lit. grip your shoulder)' vs mo-g-e-mxr-ob-i 'I'll side with you'; glexeb-ma bat'on-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)u-čok-es 'the peasantsERG knelt before the
master' vs šen mt'er-s ar c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-čok-e 'youNOM refused to
kneel before the foe'; kal-ma c'arb-eb-i še-(Ø-)i-č'mux(v)n-a 'the
w o m a n E R G knitted her eyebrows' vs kal-i
še-i-č'mux(v)n-a
'the
womanNOM frowned'; kurd-ma tav-i še-(Ø-Ø-)a-par-a bosel-s (or
tav-i če-(Ø-?Ø-)a-par-a bosel-ši) vs kurd-i bosel-s
še-(Ø-)exizn-a/še-(Ø-)e-k'edl-a 'the thief took refuge in the barn'). And one
can also point to cases where an Intransitive Verb seems little different in
šense from a Medial (e.g. i+s ma-s mi-(Ø-)e-švel-a ' X N O M went to
help/helped YDAT' vs man ma-s (?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-a 'XERG aided Y D A T ' ) .","[515, 516, 517, 518, 519]"

Either the Objective or locative Version vowel may be used as
appropriate with screeves in Series I and 11 (e.g. sp'ilo-s i+k-ve šv+l-i
(Ø-)u-c'ev-s 'its child is lying right there by the elephant', datv-i mtel-i
si+mjim-it ze+d (Ø-)a-c'v-a mo+nadir+e-s 'the bear was lying upon
the hunter with all its weight'); in addition, in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series II the Indirect Object Version vowel may serve in the role of both
the above-versions (e.g. deda-s baväv-i (Ø-)e-c'v-a muxl-eb-ze 'the
baby was lying upon its mother's knees')—a by-form for the Future (Ø-)ec'v-eb-a is (Ø-)e-c'-ol-eb-a 241
Do not confuse the bivalent Prešent in Objective Version with the
Objective Version of the Transitive Verb (Ø-Ø-)s-c'-ev 'you draw X/them'
(e.g. ešv-eb-is še+m+c'+e+ob-it sp'ilo mjime ra+me-eb-s (Ø-)s-c'ev-s 'an elephant drags heavy things with the aid of its tusks', k'at'a-m

(as in pex-eb-s rom (Ø-Ø-)m-i-c'-ev, ra č'ida+ob-is c'es-i-a? 'what

GiveMasdar = mi-/mo-c-em-a 'giving (implying some recipient)', whereas gac-em-a is used when the recipient is not so prominent (e.g. brjan+ebis/gan+k'arg+ul+eb-is ga-c-em-a 'issuing of a command/instruction',
p'asux-is ga-c-em-a 'giving a response', xm-is ga-c-em-a 'giving
voice'). Cf. gada-c-em-a 'handing on; programme, broadcast', g a - m o - c em-a 'publishing; publication' 246 , d a - c - e m - a 'collapse, fall, ruin(ation),
destruction'. For the simple šense of 'giving', the roots are -)l-, normally
restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, vs - c - elsewhere; the latter combines
with a new Thematic Suffix, -em, in the Future Sub-Series and Perfect (the
regular choice also has to be made outside the Prešent Sub-Series between464GEORGIANGRAMMARmo- and mi-), whereas the former is used with -ev and locative Version.
A further oddity is the appearance in part of the Aorist Indicative
paradigm of this Transitive Verb of the Indirect Object Versioniser, and

The above-paradigm with its suppletive root outside the Prešent SubSeries is the norm. However, KEGl quotes for the root -)l- an Aorist (ØØ-Ø-)a-)l-i-e = mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i as well as a Perfect g-i-)l-ev-i-a
-tvis = mi-g-i-c-i-a -tvis. Also there is še-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)l-ev 'you wIII
ask X/them to accept Y/them' (e.g. deda=šem-ma ekim-s pul-i še-(ØØ-)a-jl-i-a 'my mother asked the doctor to accept (the) money') => Aorist
äe-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-jl-i-e => Perfect še-g-i-)l-ev-i-a -tvis. These forms
are not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)al-eb 'you (wIII) force
X/them on Y/them' (cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-)al-eb-i 'you (wIII) force
yourself on X/them').
Do not confuse the Prešent Sub-Series forms given above with the
Transitive Verb (da-)(Ø-Ø-)s-)l-ev 'you (wIII) overcome/get the better
of/gain control of X/them'. This verb can be used without the preverb
even in the usually perfective screeves; the peculiarity is that, if there is
no preverb, then the second argument (viz. that which is overcome) in
Series II stands in the Dative, e.g.

'X bit his lip but I noticed (?on him) that he got control of himself'
whereas, if the preverb is employed, the second argument in Series II
stands in the Nominative (e.g. p'art'ia-m da-(Ø-)(?s-)jl-i-a mt'r-eb-is
c'ina + a g + m + deg + oba 'the Party overcame the opposition of (its)

mo-m-c-em-i, Future mo-sa-c-em-i, Privative mo-u-c-em-el-i (with
syncopating -e-), Past mo-c-em-ul-i or mo-na-c-em-i, which latter is
used nominally in the šense of 'datum'.
In the Prešent Sub-Series the verb 'give' may be used as a 'deponent'466GEORGI AN GRAMMARverb, which is to say that it has Intransitive/Passive morphology of the
prefixal type but is used in the šense of a verb with active voice taking a
subject and direct object only (e.g. sa+minist'r+o up+1+eba-s (?Ø-)i-)lev-a 'the Ministry gives its authority', rč+ev+a-s v-(?Ø-)i-)l-ev-i 'I am
giving (out) advice', magalit-s (?Ø-)i-)l-e-od-nen 'they were giving an
example', q'ana ga+m+jl+e p'ur-s (?Ø-)i-)l-ev-a 'the field produces
hardy wheat').
Otherwise the 'normal' bivalent Intransitive form with passive meaning
'X is given to Y' (or possibly reflexive 'X gives oneself up to Y') conjugates
thus:

Know (facts)247
Masdar = c+od+n-a.
In origin the Prešent Sub-Series forms of this verb belonged to Series II
and have retained their original syntax such that the subject stands in the
Ergative and the direct object (always 3rd person in ModernGEORGIAN)in
the Nominative; the same applies to an alternative, though less common,
verb for 'knowing', which also mirrors the morphology of its more common
synonym but tends to be found only with 3rd person subject and
specifically in such phrases as g m e r t - m a / a l a h - m a (Ø-)uc'q'-i-s 2 4 8
'God/Allah knows!'.

The Prešent Sub-Series screeves have a colloquial usage seen in such
examples as svan+et-ši did-i tovl-i (Ø-)i-c-i-s 'there is heavy snow in
Svanetia usually', where the regularly occurring noun stands in the
Nominative and the place where it occurs is not, as might be expected,
Ergative but governed by the postposition -šl.
Say

To express this notion three separate roots are used: (i) - a m b - (cf.
ambav-i, GEN = amb-isa 'news, report'—cf. ra ambav-i-a? 'what's

Four roots are employed to convey this meaning. In Series III the
paradigms just prešented for 'say' are used in association with the
postposition -tvis governing the Genitive for the notional indirect object (=
recipient of the message). In the Prešent Sub-Series the root is -ubn-,
which, though trivalent, takes the form of a bipersonal prefixal IntransitiveVERBAl MORPHOlOGY471Verb; in the Future Sub-Series the root is again - t ' q ' v - but with the
Indirect Object Version vowel governing the indirect object; in Series II
the equivalent forms of the verb (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-txr-ob (= (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-q'veb-i or (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-amb-ob) 'you relate/narrate X/them to Y/them' are
used—the Aorist Indicative is Strong but with 3rd person singular subject

its Future Sub-Series forms, whilst in association with a Transitive Verb's
Past Participle these same Future Sub-Series forms or their Series 11VERBAl MORPHOlOGY473counterparts (viz. Aorist Indicative i-kn-a 'it was done', Aorist Subjunctive
i-kn-a-s/i-kn-e-s 'it may be done') allow a (dynamic) passive voice to be
constructed, which may serve as the only passive voice for some verbs
even though in general this formation is regarded as rather bookish. An
example would be gamsaxurdia p'rezident'-ad a-rč-e-ul(-i) i-kn-a
(i-kn-eb-a) 'Gamsaxurdia was (wIII be) elected president', where we note
that the participle usually (but not obligatorily) loses its i-suffix if it
immediately precedes the auxiliarly verb 2 5 3 . 'Elect' has no synthetic
passive, but in speech the above-construction would normally be avoided in
favour of the equivalent active voice verb with indefinite 3rd person plural
subject (viz. gamsaxurdia p'rezident'-ad a-(Ø-)i-rč-i-es (Future =
gamsaxurdia-s p'rezident'-ad a-(Ø-)i-rč-ev-en)).
Active Participle = m-k(m)n-el-i, Future Participle = sa-k(m)n-el-i,
Privative Participle = u-k(m)n-el-i, Past Participle = kmn-il-i.
By using the Objective Version with -the basic forms already set out in
Series I we produce the verb-forms meaning 'do X to Y' (e.g. ra-s (Ø-ØØ-)u-švr-eb-i/(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-zam? 'what are you doing/wIII you do to
X/them?', ra-sa-c šen (Ø-Ø-)m-i-zam me, me šen (Ø-)g-i-zam
sa+mag+ier+o-d 'what you (wIII) do to me, I shall do to you in return'). In
Series III this meaning is rendered by adding the notional indirect object
as a Genitive dependent on the postposition -tvis to the verb-forms set
out above. However, in Series 11 resort has to be make to the root
-q'(a)v-, the original Intransitive/Passive form of which provides the
copula with its Series II forms:

time'. However, if the 'doing X to Y' is to be understood as 'taking Y
somewhere', then somewhat counterintuitively 'Y' stands not in the Dative
but the Nominative 254 (e.g. ra (Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-q'av-i mundir-i? 'What have
you done with = where have you put the uniform?').
This last root has a full range of screeves across the three Series in
such compounds as še+u+racx-(Ø-Ø-)q'-op 'you (wIII) insult X/them'474GEORGIANGRAMMAR(Aorist še+u+racx-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i, Perfect še+u+racx-g-i-q'v-i-a),
u+zrun+v+ei-(Ø-Ø-)q'-op 'you (will) safeguard X/them', uar-(Ø-Ø-)q'op 'you (wIII) reject/deny X/them', where the first element is an
incorporated noun/adjective. Participles are of the shape: Prešent = uarm-q'-op-(el-)i, Future = uar-sa-q'-op-(el-) i (both with syncopating
-e-), Past = uar-q'-op-il-i.

Masdar = (imperfective) xed-v-a 2 5 5 vs (perfective) nax-v-a
In the Prešent Sub-Series -xed- (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)xed-av 'you see X/them'
behaves just like any Transitive Verb with Thematic Suffix -av, whilst
elsewhere -nax- (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)nax-av 'you wIII see X/them', (Ø-Ø-)nax-e
'you saw X/them', g-i-nax-av-s 'you have seen X/them') equally behaves
just like any Transitive Verb with Thematic Suffix -av, except that no
preverb is used.
Both the roots just given are used with preverbs, but the meanings are
specific. (še-)(Ø-Ø-)i-nax-av = 'you (wIII) put X/them somewhere for
safe keeping'; in the šense of 'you notice/observe X/them' we have (ØØ-)xed-av (etc..) again in the Prešent (Sub-Series) but in the Future (SubSeries plus Series II and III) this becomes da-(Ø-Ø-)i-nax-av etc... In
perfective screeves mo-(Ø-Ø-)nax-av etc... is used in the šense of '(you
wIII) find X/them by searching'. 'look' in the Prešent Sub-Series is
indicated by the Intransitive forms of the root -xed- (e.g. kor-i jir-s ixed-eb-a 'the hawk is looking down', p'olit'ik'a-s'i še+cd+om+a rom
ar da-(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-a, c'in u+nd+a (Ø-)i-xed-eb-od-e 'so that you
don't make a mistake in politics, you should (always) be looking forward')—
these forms can also be used as true/potential passives (e.g. t v a l - i t
a+gara+per-i i-xed-eb-a 'nothing can be seen any more with the eye').
However, outside the Prešent Sub-Series 'look' is indicated by the active
Transitive form of this same root in Subjective Version (sc. in the Future
Sub-Series and Series II) and with the preverb appropriate to the direction
of the gaze, for example m o - is used for 'hither' or 'back' (e.g. kal-ma mo(?Ø-)i-xed-a 256 'the woman looked (back/this way)', kal-s mo-(Ø-)uxed-av-s 'the woman has looked (back/this way)'); if we wish to indicate
what is being looked at with such verbs, we simply add an indirect object,
whose marker in the Future Sub-Series and in Series II replaces the
Subjective Version vowel (e.g. kal-ma mo-(?Ø-)m-xed-a 'the woman
looked (back/this way) at me', kal-s čem-tvis mo-(Ø-)u-xed-av-s 'the
woman has looked (back/this way) at me'). da-(Ø-Ø-)xed-e(-t) as the
Imperative which strictly means 'look down at X/them' is often abbreviated
to da-(Ø-Ø-)xe(-t) and used in the šense of 'just look there!'. TheVERBAl MORPHOlOGY475Intransitive Prešent i-nax-eb-a may mean 'X is being kept' (relating to
Aorist še-i-nax-a = še-nax-ul i-kn-a and Perfect š n a x - u l - a ) or 'X
may be found' (relating to Aorist mo-i-nax-a = mo-nax-ul i-kn-a and
Perfect mo-nax-ul-a); alternatively, it may be used in the phrase av-i
tval-it ar i-nax-eb-a 2 5 7 'X is not seen with the evil eye', a colloquialism
meaning 'X is attractive' (the respective Aorist and Perfect are i-nax-a
and nax-ul-a). Notice the Medial Verb (Ø-Ø-)nax+ul-ob ((Ø-Ø-)inax+ul-eb) 'you (wIII) go somewhere to see X/them'. Note also (Ø-Ø-)ixil-av 2 5 8 'you will see/view X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-xil-e, Perfect g-ixil-av-s), the Imperative of which is indicated by the abbreviation ix. for
(Ø-Ø-)i-xil-e(-t) Vid.' = Vide(te)'.
Active Participle for the basic verbs of seeing = m-xed-av-i/m-xedv - e l - i / m - x i l - v - e l - i / m - n a x - v - e l - i , Future Participle = sa-nax-avi/sa-xil-v-el-i, Privative Participle = u-nax-av-i/ar-nax-ul-i/u-xilav-i/u-xil-v-el-i, Past Participle = nax-ul-i/na-nax-i/xil-ul-i. From
äe-sa-xed-(av-)i 'worth looking at' the abstract-noun is š s a - x e d - a oba = s-e-xed-ul-oba/gare+gn+oba (e.g. mi+u+xed+av+ad mi+m+
zid+v+el-i še-sa-xed-a-ob-isa, nino mainc ver
(Ø-)e-gir+s-a
si+q'var+ul-s 'despite an alluring external appearance Nino was stIII not
able to become worthy of love').
For 'look at' there are also the Transitive Verbs (regular except that
they take no preverb): (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'ur-eb 259 (Aorist = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)uq'ur-e, Perfect g-i-q'ur-eb-i-a -tvis) = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cker(-i 2 6 Ø
)
(Aorist = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-ckir-e, Perfect g-i-cker-i-a -tvis) = (Ø-?ØØ-)u-mzer (Aorist = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-mzir-e, Perfect g-i-mzer-i-a -tvis)
'you (wIII) look at X/them'. used as formal intransitives in the Prešent SubSeries only (viz.
(Ø-)i-ckir-eb-i/(Ø-)i-q'ur-eb-i/(Ø-)i-mzir-eb-i)
each
of these three roots are then synonyms for (Ø-)i-xed-eb-i in the šense of
'look, gaze' (e.g. panjr-i+dan i-ckir-eb-a 'X is looking/gazing out of the
window'). The first two of these roots may be used transitively with a
variety of preverbs, but again only in the Prešent Sub-Series, in association
with an indirect object marked without versioniser to indicate the notion of
looking/gazing at some entity with the added nuance of directionality (e.g.
mta bar-s da-s-cker-od-a = da-h-q'ur-eb-d-a 'the mountain was
gazing down at the valley'; the preverb š
here conveys either the
expected nuance of 'into' or more surprisingly 'up at', since there is no verb
*a-(Ø-)s-cker-i, as in k'ak'1-is magal št'o-eb-s še-s-cker-i-an =
še-h-q'ur-eb-en 'they are gazing up at the high branches of the walnuttree'). KEGl also quotes the inceptive with indirect object (da-)(Ø-Ø-)acker-d-eb-i (Aorist = da-(Ø-Ø-)a-cker-d-i, Perfect = da-(Ø-)s-ckereb-i-xa+r 2 6 1 ) 'you (wIII) gaze intently upon X/them', whereas with the476GEORGIANGRAMMARpreverb še- it quotes only the Future š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - c k e r - d - e b - i
(reprešenting the Future Sub-Series) and Aorist še-(Ø-Ø-)a-cker-d-i
(reprešenting Series II) in the šense of 'you wIII/did start to look at X/them'
(e.g. š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - č e r - a
tval-eb-i
jera-m
k'ač'k'ač'-s
da
ga+oc+eb+ul-i še-(Ø-)a-cker-d-a 'the kite brought its eyes to rest on
the magpie and began in amazement to eye it').
Active Participle = m a - q ' u r - e b - e l - i / m a - c k e r - a l - I / m o - m z e r - a l - i
(all with syncopation in the penultimate syllable) 'viewer', Future = s a q , ur-eb-el-i/sa-cker-(el-)i/sa-mzer-el-i (with syncopating - e - in the
el-component).
Note some verbs found only in the Prešent Sub-Series which reprešent
the notion 'look' coupled with the extra lexical feature of the root, viz. še(Ø-Ø-)xar-i 'you look joyously upon X/them' (Imperfect in -od-), for the
root of which cf. (Ø-)u-xar-i-a 'X rejoices', s-e-(Ø-)h-popin-eb = š e (Ø-)s-t'rp-i (Imperfect in -od-, which is related to (Ø-Ø-)e-t'rp-i 'you
hold loving feeling towards X/them', also with Imperfect in -od-) 'you look
lovingly upon X/them'—another synonym is še-(Ø-)h-prpin-av, but this
Transitive Verb exists in all three Series. Of similar structure is š e (Ø-)h-per-i = še-(Ø-Ø-)även-i 'you suit/conform to X/them' (I mperfect
in -od-), whose synonyms are s-e-(Ø-Ø-)e-per-eb-i and, with a full
paradigm of screeves, š ( Ø - Ø - ) e - s a b a m - e b - i (Aorist še-(Ø-Ø-)esabam-e, Perfect
še-(Ø-Ø-)sabam-eb-i-x-a+r).
look Resplendent, Adorn
From - S v e n - we have in the Prešent Sub-Series only ( Ø - ) š v e n - i
(Imperfect in -od-), which as a monopersonal verb means 'look resplendent'
(e.g. erek'le cxen-ze šven-od-a 'Erek'le looked resplendent on the
horse'), but as a bipersonal verb it means for the form g-šven-i-s 'X
suits/is an adornment to you' (e.g. pšav=xevsur-s (Ø-)šven-i-s abjar-i
'chain-mail is an adornment to Pshav-Khevsurians'). A regular (and
cognate) verb for 'making beautiful; adorn' is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mšven-eb
'you (wIII) beautify X/them' (e.g. ara+vitar-i sa+mk'+a+ul-i ar (Ø-)amšven-eb-d-a
otax-s 'no decoration was adorning the room').
(Ø-)šven-i-s may also serve as a synonym to še-(Ø-)e-per-eb-a/še-hper-i-s/še-(Ø-)šven-i-s.

In the Prešent Sub-Series it is possible to add a further indirect object
by making use of the Objective Version (e.g. šen ra (?Ø-)g-i-g+av-s
čem-s šv+il-s? 'what of you is like my son? = in what way do you
resemble my son?').
The dynamic verb 'grow to resemble' is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-m+s+g+av+seb-i = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-m+g+v+an-eb-i 'you (wIII) grow to resemble
X/them' (Aorist ( d a - ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - m + s + g + av + s-e = ( d a - ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e m+g+v+an-e, Perfect (da-)(Ø-Ø-)m+s+g+av+s-eb-i-x-a+r = (da-)(ØØ-)m+g+v+an-eb-i-x-a+r).
Drink
Masdar = s-m-a (imperfective) vs da-1-ev-a (perfective)
The Prešent Sub-Series is built on (Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you drink X/them',
which behaves like a normal verb in -am (Passive = i-s-m-eb-a 'X is
drinkable', n a - s v - a m - i = m-tvr-al-i 'drunk'). The perfective screeves
are usually built on da-(Ø-Ø-)l-ev 'you wIII drink X/them', which behaves
like a normal verb in -ev (e.g. Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)l-i-e, Perfect da-g-i-lev-i-a). The Causative is usually based on the perfective root (e.g.
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-I-ev-in-eb 'you (wIII) get X/them to drink Y/them'),
though (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev is possible (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sv-i, Perfect gi-s-m-ev-i-a -tvis). There is also an entirely regular verb (s'e-)(ØØ-)sv-am 'you (wIII) consume drink X' (cf. (še-)(Ø-Ø-)č'am 'you (wIII)
devour X/them'), though it is perhaps most common in the phrase vin-me-s478GEORGIANGRAMMARsa+dge+grj+el+o-s (še-)(Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you (will) propose someone'sGEN
toast'.
Active Participle da-m-1-ev-i (m-s-m-el-i is rather used as the noun
'drinker'), Future Participle da-sa-1-ev-i/sa-s-m-el-i (the latter with its
syncopating -e- being often used nominally in the šense of 'drink'),
Privative Participle da-u-1-ev-el-i, Past Participle da-1-e-ul-i (cf. nasv-am-i used primarily of someone who is himself 'drunk', though it can be
used of the liquid imbibed and thus 'drunk' in the true participial šense).
Convey
Masdar = mo-q'van-a 'bringing (animate(s) 263 )' vs m o - t ' a n - a 'bringing
(inanimate(s))'—by changing the preverb the directionality of the
conveyance is altered according to the regular meaning of the preverbs
(e.g. š e - q ' v a n - a / š t ' a n - a 'taking in' vs äe-mo-q'van-a/s'e-mo-t'an-a
'bringing in').
In the Prešent Sub-Series the appropriate preverb is simply added to
the appropriate expression for 'X has Y' (e.g. (Ø-)m-q'+av-x-a+r 'I have
you' => mo-(Ø-)m-q'+av-x-a+r 'I am bringing you', v-(Ø-)q'+av-v-a+r-t
'X has/they have us' => a+m kuča-s ar mi-v-(Ø-)q'+av-v-a+r-t t'ajra-mde 'this street is not leading us to the church', g-k+on-d-a c'ign-i
'you had a book' => še-mo-g-k+on-d-a c'ign-i 'you were bringing in
a/the book')—for the verbs meaning 'have' see 4.7.4.
Outside the Prešent Sub-Series the verb-forms move from Indirect
Verbs to normal Transitives based on the roots -q'van-/-t'an-, which
behave like normal Root Verbs having Subjective Version in their
fundamental forms in the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11 (with Perfects
of the expected form mo-g-i-q'van-i-a/mo-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you have
brought animate(s)/inanimate(s)'). The Objective Version may substitute
where appropriate, making some forms ambiguous out of context (e.g.
momiq'vans may be analysed as m o - m - i - q ' v a n - s 'X will bring me
(hither)' in Subjective Version vs mo-(Ø-)m-i-q'van-s 'X will bring
animate X/them to me' in Objective Version). The animate-inanimate
distinction breaks down somewhat with the verb-forms da-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van
(e.g. sa+saxl+e-n-i da-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e-t ma-t sa+jirk'v+1-a-mde
'reduce the palaces to their foundations', sa+ert+o m+nis'vn+el-ze da(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van 'you will reduce X/them to a common denominator') and da(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an (e.g. kva kva-s (Ø-)e-c-a da me šua-ši da-m-i-t'ana
'stone crashed into stone and carried me down in the middle').
(a-/gada-)(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an means 'you (will) put up with/bear X/them'
(Perfect a-/gada-g-i-t'an-i-a).
The participles for the verbs indicating conveyance are of the type:VERBAl MORPHOlOGY479Active Participle = m o - m - t ' a n - i / m o - m - q ' v a n - i 'bringing', Future
Participle = mo-sa-t'an-i/mo-sa-q'van-i, Privative Participle = m o - u t ' a n - e l - i / m o - u - q ' v a n - e l - i 'not bringing' (with syncopating -el-), Past
Participle = mo-t'an-il-i/mo-q'van-il-i 'having been brought'.
Note the meaning of (da-)(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)a-t , an 'you (will) set X/them
somewhere' (e.g. a+k k'ar-eb-i da-v-(Ø-)a-t'an-o-t tu panjara?
'should we set/hang doors here or a window?) and in the šense of 'exert
(pressure)' we have examples like jala da-(Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-a tav+is tavsa da ra+m+den+i+me luk'ma ča-(Ø-lq'lap'-a 'X forced himself and
swallowed a few mouthfuls'). Note also that the Perfect now has the form
da-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a. This same form of the Perfect is seen in other verbforms of parallel structure in Series I such as (mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-t'an =>
Perfect m o - g - i - t ' a n - e b - i - a (e.g. k'ac-ma na+p'ir-s mo-(?Ø-Ø-)at'an-a 'the man drew close to the edge/shore', še+mo+dg+om+a-m m o ( ? Ø - ? Ø - ) a - t ' a n - a 'autumn approached') or (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an =>
Perfect g a - g - i - t ' a n - e b - i - a (e.g. ar še-i-)l-eb-a e+s c'er+il-i vi-sme ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-o-t? 'isn't it possible for us to get someone to
take this letter?'). The Causatives of the verb-forms indicating conveyance
in some direction have the shape seen in (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'van-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to bring animate(s)', (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to take inanimate(s) out'.
The participles for verb-forms of the type (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an are:
Active Participle = ga-m-t'an-eb-el-i, Future Participle = ga-sa-t'ane b - e l - i , Privative Participle = g a - u - t ' a n - e b - e l - i (all three with
syncopating -e-), Past Participle = ga-t'an-eb-ul-i.
The root -t'an- has an interesting bivalent Intransitive usage with a
number of preverbs to specify different directionality as exemplified by
(mi-XØ-Ø-)e-t'an-eb-i 'you (will) try to reach out to and catch hold of
X/them' (e.g. vin ar mi-(Ø-)s-t'an-eb-i-x-a+r-t otax-ši š m o - p r en-il čit'-s? 'who amongst you 264 has not tried to reach and catch a bird
that has flown into the room?').

to the Prešent Sub-Series, though we have a derived Medial Verb (ØØ-)k'mar-ob 'you are satisfied with X/them' 265 (Future = (Ø-Ø-)i-k'mareb, Aorist = (Ø-Ø-) i-k'mar-e, Perfect = g-i-k f mar-(n-)i-a). We have
the cognate adjectives s a - m + q' + o p - i / s a - k ' m a r - i s - i / s a + k'ma + o
'sufficient'. Note also k'mar-a! 'Enough!', (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-k'ma+q'+op+ileb 'you (will) satisfy X/them' (cf. k'ma-q'-op-il-i 'satisfied'), (Ø-Ø-Ø-)ak'mar-eb = (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-m+q'+op-in-eb 'you (will) deem X/them sufficient
for Y/them' (e.g. m g e l - s
si+k'vd+il-i
ar
(Ø-Ø-)a-k'mar-a
mo+nadir+e-m 'the hunter didn't deem death (alone) sufficient for the
wolf', cot'a gvino (Ø-)gv-a-m+q'+op-in-a junc'-ma 'the selfish one
judged a little wine to be enough for us').
Fall (down)
Masdar = da-varč+n-a (singular) vs da-cviv+n-a/da-cven-a (plural)
The two roots, distinguished according to the singularity vs plurality of
the subject, are used with a variety of preverbs depending on the direction
of the fall. I llustration is with da- indicating the simple notion of 'down'.
As monovalent Intransitives we have: Prešent vard-eb-a vs cviv-d-eb-a
or cviv-d-eb-i-an (if the plural subject imposes its plurality on the verb)
or possibly cviv-a(n), Future da-vard-eb-a vs d a - c v i v - d - e b - a / d a cviv-d-eb-i-an/da-cviv-a(n), Aorist da-vard-a vs da-cviv-d-a/dacviv-d-nen, Perfect da-varč+n-il-a vs da-cven-il-a(n)/da-cviv+n-482GEORGIANGRAMMARul-a(n) (the other screeves are formed from these as would be expected).
As bivalent I ntransitives 'fall down off/from X' we have: Prešent (Ø-)vardeb-a vs s - c v i v - d - e b - a / s - c v i v - d - e b - i - a n / s - c v i v - a ( n ) , Future da(Ø-)vard-eb-a vs d a - s - c v i v - d - e b - a / d a - s - c v i v - d - e b - i - a n / d a - s cviv-a(n), Aorist da-(Ø-)vard-a vs da-s-cviv-d-a/da-s-cviv-d-nen,
Perfect da-(Ø-)varč+n-i-a vs da-s-cven-i-a(n)/da-s-cviv+n-i-a(n).
The Past Participles are da-varč+n-l-i/da-cven-il-i/da-cviv+n-ul-i
'(having) fallen'.
Throw (down)
Masdar = da-gd-eb-a (singular) vs da-q'r-a (plural)
These are the Transitive roots corresponding to the Intransitive pair
just prešented for 'fall (down)', and the suppletion is now, of course,
determined by the entity thrown (i.e. the underlying direct object). A
number of preverbs are used with these roots, but the IIIustration takes
da- for the basic šense of 'throwing down'.
The first root is regular for a verb with Thematic Suffix -eb (e.g.
Prešent (Ø-Ø-)a-gd-eb, Future da-(Ø-Ø-)a-gd-eb, Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)agd-e, Perfect da-g-i-gd-i-a), whilst the latter is regular for a verb with
Thematic Suffix -i (e.g. Prešent (Ø-Ø-)q'r-i, Future da-(Ø-Ø-)q'r-i,
Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)q'ar-e, Perfect da-g-i-q'r-i-a).
Note the expressions: q'ur-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-gd-eb = q'ur-s (Ø-ØØ-)a-txov-eb 'you (will) pay attention to X/them'; tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)iq'r-i-t 'you(Pl) (will) gather together' vs k'vercx-eb-s tav-s (mo-)(ØØ-Ø-)u-q'r-i 'you (will) gather the eggs together'; xel-t/xel-ši (ča-)(ØØ-)i-gd-eb 'you (will) get your hands on X/them = take X/them into your
clutches', where the preverb is optional even in the perfective screeves
and where the root does not change even for a plural object.
Meet
Masdar = še-xved+r-a/še-xvd-om-a. For meeting by appointment (e.g.
at a railway-/bus-station) the preverb is changed to da- (with this preverb
the indirect object in Series I and 11 may be indicated by means of the
Objective Version); if the preverb is mo-, the meaning is 'hitting (target)'.
Prešent = (Ø-Ø-)xvd-eb-i 'you meet X/them', Future = š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v d eb-i, Aorist = š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) x v d - i , Perfect = š e - ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e d + r - i - x a + r / š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v d - o m - i - x - a + r . Examples: gza-ši mo+nadir+e-eb-i
še-(Ø-)xvd-nen
lom-s 'the hunters met a lion on the road', sada+c
xsn+a-s (Ø-)e-l-od-nen, met'-i gan+sa+cd+el-i še-(Ø-)xvd-a-t
'where they were awaiting salvation, they met with greater torment =
greater torment befell them', in which latter clause the verb could beVERBAl MORPHOlOGY483interchanged with še-(Ø-)e-mtxv-a-t/mo-(Ø-)u-xd-a-t/gada-(Ø-)xda-t/tav-s = tav-ze da-(Ø-)a-t , q , d-a-t. Note that in the expression
c'il-ad g-xvd-eb-a 'X falls to your lot' no preverb is used in any
screeve. In addition to meaning 'hit (target)' (e.g. t'q'via pex-ši mo(Ø-)xvd-a datv-s 'the bullet hit the bear in the foot'), the Aorist with 2nd
person subject is used as the equivalent to 'wrong number!' (viz. ar mo-(Ø?Ø-)xvd-i(-t)) when answering the phone.
The participles are of the form: Active = š m - x v e d + r - i / š e - m - x v d om-i/še-m-xvd-ur-i, Future = š s a - x v e d + r - i , Past = še-xved+r-ili/šm-xvd-ar-i.
The Causative is of the form (š)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xved+r-eb 'you (will)
give X/them the opportunity to meet Y/them' (e.g. ra-m mo-m-i-q'van-a
a+m šen(-s) saxl-ši da še-m-(Ø-)a-xved+r-a šen(-s) tav-sa? 'what
brought me into this house of yours and gave me the opportunity to meet
you?266'). Non-finite forms are as one would expect of a verb in -eb.
The verb for 'realise' is odd insofar as it patterns in Series I and II just
like 'meet' with Nominative subject and Dative object, and yet in Series III,
even though the Dative nominal is retained, the verb is monopersonal in
form (viz. a+m xel+na+c'er-is pas-s ver (Ø-?Ø-)xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø?Ø-)xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø-?Ø-)xvd-i/mi-(Ø-)m-xvd-ar-x-a+r 'you can't/
won't be able to/couldn't/haven't been able to realise the price of this
manuscript'); only if a further Dative nominal, marked in Series I and II by
the Objective Version, is added, does the III rd Series become formally
bipersonal (viz. g l - i s c'ad+il-s ver (Ø-?Ø-)m-i-xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø?Ø-)m-i-xvd-eb-i/mi-(Ø-?Ø-)m-i-xvd-i/mi-(Ø-?Ø-)m-xvd-om-i-xa+r 'you are/will be/were/have been unable to realise my heart's desire').
The non-finite forms are: Masdar mi-xvedr-a/mi-xvd-om-a, Active
Participle m i - m - x v e d r - i / m i - m - x v d - o m - i / m i - m - x v d - u r - i , Future
Participle mi-sa-xvedr-i/mi-sa-xvd-om-i, Privative Participle m i - u x v e d r - e l - i / m i - u - x v d - o m - e l - i (the latter with syncopating suffixal
vowel), Past Participle mi-xvedr-il-i/mi-m-xvd-ar-i.
Be in front of/come before
The expression is as in: ianvar-i c'in (Ø-)u-)gv-i-s teberval-s
'January comes before February' (cf. teberval-i uk'an mo-s-d-ev-s
ianvar-s 'February follows after January'). The same expression may also
mean 'lead and shew the way to' (e.g. q'oran-i mgel-s c'in (Ø-)u-)g-oda 'the raven was leading and shewing the way to the wolf), from which it is
a small step to meaning 'be the leader of' (e.g. sa+zog+ad+o+eba-s c'in
(Ø-)u-)gv-i-s me+cn+ier-i 'a scholar/scientist is the leader of the
society'). The verb is also used as an Indirect Verb in the šense of 'having484GEORGIANGRAMMARX to one's name' (e.g. did-i gvac'+l-i g-i-)gv-i-s sa+m+š+ob+l+o-s
c'in 'you have great service to your name before your homeland'). For
each of these šenses the verb may optionally take the preverb m i - (e.g.
k'rux-i q'ovel+tvis c'in mi-(Ø-)u-)gv-i-s c'ic'il-eb-s 'the hen always
leads the way for the chicks', ra bral-i mi-g-i-)gv-i-t kal-is
si+k'vd+il-ši? 'what fault lies with you(Pl) in the death of the woman?').
As dynamic bivalent Intransitive equivalents we have (Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-ebi/ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-eb-i/ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-)ex-i 267
/ga-(Ø-)s-)g-ol-i-x-a+r
'you are/will be/were/have been leader/supervisor of X/them' or (Ø-Ø-)ujgv-eb-i/mi-(Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-eb-i/mi-(Ø-Ø-)u-)ex-i/ml-(Ø-)s-)g-ol-ix-a+r 'you, leading, guide/will guide/guided/have guided X/them thither'.
Non-finite forms are of the pattern: Masdar ga-)g-ol-a, Active Participle
ga-m-)g-ol-i (cf. m-)g-ol-i 'driver'), Future Participle ga-sa-)g-ol-i,
Past Participle ga-)g-ol-il-i (N.B. c'a-na-m+jgv+ar-i = c'ina-p'ir-oba
'pre-condition', which seems to be a doubly marked Past Participle in both
na- and circumfix m- -ar from the Future c'a-(Ø-Ø-)u-)gv-eb-i 'you
will lead X/them forward, will direct (the course of) X/them' = c'ar(Ø-Ø-)mart-av = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-xel+m+jgv+an+el-eb, which in turn
comes from xel+m+jgv+an+el-i 'supervisor, overseer' and must originally
have meant something like 'guiding the hand xel-i' with Active Participle in
m- -el from a no longer extant Transitive form of this root).
Do not confuse the above-forms in mi- with the normal Transitive Verb
in -i, namely (mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)gvn-i 'you (will) dedicate X/them to
Y/them' (for the root cf. jgven-i 'gift'268 ).
Make for/as if to attack X, go for/lay into X, have it in for X; be strong
enough for X
The verb in question exists only in the Prešent Sub-Series and is (Ø-Ø-)er č - i (Imperfect in -od-) (e.g. gul-i tu ar (Ø-)e-rč-i-s k'ac-s, pex-it
sul ver (?Ø-)i-vl-i-s-o 'if a man's heart is not strong, he won't be able
to move on foot, they say'). II is common in the question: ra-s (Ø-?Ø-)me-rč-i = (Ø-?Ø-)m-e-martl-eb-i 'why are you laying into me/do you
have it in for me?'.
Wait for
Masdar = lod+in-i. In the Prešent we have (Ø-Ø-)e-l-i 'you are waiting
for X/them', which may also be expressed by (Ø-Ø-)e-l+od+in-eb-i and
(Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-eb-i;
the first two verbs exist only in the Prešent SubSeries, with Imperfects in -od-, whilst the third may be used without
alteration as a Future Indicative and also has Series II forms, such as the
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-e. If we make use of the preverb da- to give theVERBAl MORPHOlOGY485Future da-(Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-eb-i 'you will wait for X/them', the verb-form
now has a full paradigm of screeves (Aorist da-(Ø-Ø-)e-l+od-e, Perfect
da-(Ø-Ø-)l+od-eb-i-x-a+r). mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-l-i 'you are expecting
X/them' exists only in the Prešent Sub-Series (cf. mo-1 + od + i n - i
'expectation', mo-sa-1+od+n-el-i 'to be expected', mo-u-1+od+n-el-i
'unexpected').
Be silent
Masdar = dum-il-i = čum-ad q'+op+n-a.

2.2.3.1.4 Semi-indirect Quotation
This strategy employs rom accompanied by appropriate changes of person,
though the tense of the quoted verb remains what it was at the moment of
speech/thought, e.g.

Regardless of the construction employed, the use of deictic and spatiotemporal markers seems to be quite free, either that which was appropriate
at the moment of speech/thought or that appropriate at the moment of
citation being permitted, as long as the precise reference is clear from the
context.
For a fuller discussion of speech-reporting inGEORGIAN(and other
Caucasian languages) see Hewitt and Crisp (1986). For a separate study of
the particle - t k o / - t k v - a see Hewitt (1982) or, in English and with
corrections to the earlier German translation, (1984). On parataxis in
Caucasian languages and the relevance thereto of direct quotation see
Hewitt (1984a) or, in German translation, (1984b). For a peculiarity of
speech-reporting in the related Svan language see Hewitt (1982a).
5.2.2.3.1.5 Indirect Commands
An indirect command can, of course, be conveyed by direct quotation with
appropriate speech-particle. Otherwise the finite reprešentation will
conform to the rules given earlier for purpošclauses, namely either the618GEORGIANGRAMMARAorist SUBJunctive or Pluperfect Indicative will be used.
Masdar is possible as the non-finite variant, e.g.","[633, 634, 635, 636, 637]"
"For 'dividing into a number of pieces' the preverb will be da-.
4.7.1.1.2.2 Conditional (xolme+ob+it-i)
This screeve has the šense of either 'X would VERB' or 'X would have
VERBed'; in association with the particle xolme 'as a rule', from which it
takes itsGEORGIANdesignation, the overall meaning of 'X would as a rule
VERB' differs little from that of the I mperfect Indicative.
The screeve is formed by adding to the base of the Future Indicative238GEORGIANGRAMMAR(viz. Preverb+Versioniser+Root+Thematic Suffix) -d + the same endings as
we saw above for the Imperfect Indicative. This means that for those
verbs whose Future Indicative differs from their Prešent Indicative merely
by the addition of a preverb, their Conditional will differ from their
Imperfect Indicative merely by the addition of the preverb, so that one
might be tempted to think that the Conditional is formed from the I mperfect
Indicative by simple addition of the preverb. However, such a parallelism
will not, of course, apply in the case of those verbs whose Future
Indicative does not bear this relation to the Prešent Indicative, as we shall
see in later sections.

In Series II screeves the subject for verbs in this Transitive Class stands
in the Ergative case and is cross-referenced in the verb-form by means of
a Set A affix, whereas the direct object stands in the Nominative(Absolutive) and is cross-referenced by means of a Set B affix, whilst the
indirect object remains unchanged in the Dative, cross-referenced by
means of a Set B affix.
The screeves of Series II prešent an action as a momentary event. For
roots that are associated with a preverb in the Future Sub-Series, this
perfectivising preverb will almost always be used in Series II, as past
momentary events (indicated by the Aorist Indicative) are normally viewed
as aspectually perfective, as are non-factual references to the future (the
function of the Aorist Subjunctive). However, preverbless Series II verbforms are not unknown. Consider the proverb:
tagv-ma
(Ø-)txar-a,
moušERG (3rd.PER-)dig-it(AOR)(Ø-)txar-a,
(3rd.PER-)dig-it(AOR)k'at'a
cat(NOM)ga-mo-(Ø-)txar-a
PREV-PREV-tit-)dig.out-it(AOR)
'the mouse dug (and) dug (and finally) dug out a cat'
where the first two preverbless forms reprešent momentary but incomplete
acts of digging which lead to the momentary but complete act of digging
out the cat that gobbled up the mouse, who could not leave matters alone.
For an Aorist Subjunctive without preverb we have:
q'vela-m u+nd+a
(Ø-)a-k,et-o-s
all-ERG
must
(it-)NV-do-AOR.SUBJ-he
'everyone should do his own job'tav+is-i sa+km+e
own-AGR business(NOM)where the generic nature or universal and timeless applicability of the
statement is the reason for there being no preverb, even if each individual
can be expected to carry his own job to completion on any given occasion.
The preverb(s) will be the same as in the Future Sub-Series and the
versioniser(s) will also follow the pattern of Series I.
4.7.1.2.1 Aorist Indicative (na+m+q'+o jir+it+ad-i = c'q'vet'+il-i)
This screeve is primarily used for simple actions in the past that are
viewed as momentary events, but the screeve also stands in real conditions243VERBAl MORPHOlOGYas an alternative to the Future Indicative with reference to the future.
For all Transitive Verbs (indeed for all verbs of any sort, other than (i)
the basic verb of motion and (ii) any verb which happens not to possess an
Aorist Indicative) the Imperative is identical with the 2nd person subject
forms of the Aorist Indicative. A few verbs may colloquially shorten their
Imperatives; all such cases will be indicated.
There are two main types of conjugation differentiated according to
which suffixal vowel marks the Aorist Indicative (= Simple Past) when the
subject is either 1st or 2nd person: the Weak, in which the relevant
exponent is -e, and the Strong, in which the relevant exponent is - i —
occasionally for stylistic, archaising purposes one may find this latter
vowel omitted for some verbs when it stands in word-final position. A 3rd
person singular subject will select either -a or -o, whilst a 3rd person
plural subject is marked by the allomorph -es. In general, though not
universally, the Thematic Suffixes are abšent in Series II. Other changes
that affect the shape of the root will be indicated where appropriate.
Thematic Suffix -eb
The Thematic Suffix disappears without exception. For roots with vowels
the conjugation is Weak with 3rd person singular subject selecting -a;
roots without a vowel are usually Weak with 3rd person singular subject
taking -o, though if the root ends in one of the sonants - 1 / r / n the
conjugation is not only Strong with 3rd person singular subject in -o but,
when the subject is 1st or 2nd person, either an -e- or, less commonly, an
-a- will be inserted into the root. Examples:

The verb (da-)(Ø-Ø-)d-eb 'you (will) put X/them down flat' has two
alternative Aorist paradigms:
da-v-(Ø-)d-e
da-v-(Ø-)dev-i
da-(Ø-Ø-)d-e

da-(Ø-Ø-)d-e-t
da-(Ø-Ø-)dev-i-t
da-(Ø-)d-es
da-(Ø-)dv-es
The root - š v is also anomalous. The paradigm below is for the
expression še+cd+om+a-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-eb 'you (will) make a
mistake', where the referent of the versional object is unclear:
(še+cd+om+a) da-v-(Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i
(še+cd+om+a) da-(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i
(še+cd+om+a) da-(Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-a(še+cd+om+a) da-v-(Ø-?Ø-)u-Sv-i-t
(še+cd+om+a) da-(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-Sv-i-t
(še+cd+om+a) da-(Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-esAn additional syntactic peculiarity of this root when used in the šense
of 'release X/them' is that, although the entity 'X/them' is treated as the245VERBAl MORPHOlOGYdirect object and thus stands in the Nominative in Series II, this same
entity nevertheless controls the form of the Objective Version vowel (e.g.
m t ' r - e b - i ga-v-(?Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i 4 3 'I let the foes go' vs me, m a - t - i
mt'er-i, ga-(?Ø-)m-i-šv-es 'they let me, their enemy, go').
Some examples for variable combinations of arguments with the verbs
'bear' and 'praise', for which root the use of the preverb is optional, would
be: da-g-bad-e-t 'I bore you(Pl)' vs 'we bore you/you(Pl.)', da-g-bad-a-t
'X bore you(Pl.)', da-(Ø-)gv-bad-e-t 'you(Pl) bore us', ( š ) m - a - k - e s
'they praised me', ( š ) g - a - k - o - t 'X praised you(Pl.)', (s'e-)g-a-k-e 'I
praised you'.
Some other vowelless roots in this sub-class are seen in: k'ar-i ga-(ØØ - ) a - g - e 'you opened the door', b o l o
mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-g-e
Se+tk+m+ul+eba-s 'you put an end to the conspiracy', amanat-i mi-(ØØ-)i-g-e 'you received the packet', ra a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e? 'what did you pick
up?', ra c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e? 'what did you take?', surat-i gada-(Ø-Ø-)ig-e 'you took a picture', q'vela+per-i ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e 'you understood

sa+na+jl+e+o c'a-(Ø-Ø-)a-g-e 'you lost the bet', xapang-i/maxe da(Ø-Ø-)a-g-e 'you set a trap'.
Root Verbs
The Aorist is Weak with 3rd person singular in -a. The extra factor here,
however, is that some verbs with the vowel -e- in their root change this to
-i- throughout Series II. Examples:
da-v-(Ø-)c'er-eI wroteda-v-(Ø-)i-č'ir-eda-(Ø-Ø-)c'er-e

"38ØGEORGIANGRAMMARBe in difficulty = -č'ir(+v)The true Indirect Verb is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series, whilst
elsewhere it borrows from a related suffixal Intransitive, though still with
Dative subject: g-i-č'ir-s 'you are in difficulty, find X/them difficult 123 '
(e.g. ra (Ø-)u-č'ir-d-a? 'what difficulty was X in?'); cf. (ga-)g-i-č'ir-deb-a 'you are (will be) in difficulty' => Aorist ga-g-i-č'ir-d-a => Perfect
ga-g-č'ir+v-eb-i-a. Transitively we have (ga-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-č'ir(+v)-eb
'you (will) make X/them difficult' and (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-č'ir(+v)-eb 'you
(will) make X/them difficult for Y/them'. Cf. in the Prešent Sub-Series only
the non-Indirect č'ir-s (e.g. kal-is ga+txov+eb+a č'ir-d-a 'getting the
woman married was difficult'), from which we can produce the following
Indirect Verb:
Be ill with, suffer from = -ä'ir(+v)g-č'ir-s (kar-eb-i) 'you are ill (with rheumatism)' => Imperfect g-č'ird-a => Future g-e-č'ir(+v)-eb-a => Perfect g-č'ir+v-eb-i-a (with no
Series II) (e.g. mo+nadir+e-eb-s ert-i cud-i zne s-č'ir+v-eb-i-a-t
'the hunters apparently suffered from one bad habit').
Rejoice = -xar- (cf. si-xar-ul-i 'joy')
The Indirect Verb proper only exists in the Prešent Sub-Series: g-i-xar-ia 'you rejoice' => Imperfect g-i-xar-od-a => Future ga-g-i-xar-d-eb-a
(also the prescriptively proscribed ga-g-e-xar-d-eb-a) => Aorist ga-gi-xar-d-a (also the prescriptively proscribed g a - g - e - x a r - d - a ) =>
Perfect ga-g-xar-eb-i-a. Transitively we have: (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-xar-eb
'you (will) make X/them happy' and (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-xar-eb 'you (will)
make X/them happy for Y/them'. As a Medial we have (Ø-)xar-ob 'you
bask in joy' (=> Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-xar-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xar-e =>
Perfect g-i-xar-(n-)i-a), as in: i+s sa+km+e, sada-c kal-eb-i ar
(?Ø-)u-r-ev-i-an, ver xar-ob-s 'that business where women are not
involved cannot be joyful'. The preverbal Medial ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xar-eb (=>
Aorist ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xar-e => Perfect ga-g-i-xar-(n-)i-a) means 'you
will experience a feeling of joy' and differs little in šense from ga-g-i/exar-d-eb-a. N.B. the common participle seen in: mo-xar-ul-i v-a+r,
rom še-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-a+r-e čem-tan 'I am delighted that you have
popped in at my place'.
Be able to do something = -)l- (cf. Masdar še-jl-eb-a)
še-g-i-)l-i-a 'you can do X' (še-(Ø-)u-)l-i-a 'X can do Y')=> Future šeg - e - ) l - e b - a => Aorist š e - g - e - ) l - o => Perfect š e - g - ) l - e b - i - a .
Transitively we have Future še-(Ø-Ø-)(i-)jl-eb => Aorist s-e-(Ø-Ø-)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY381(i-)jel-i, which then lacks Series III such that the Indirect š g - ) l - e b - i a etc... has to fill the gap; the Causative is (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)l-eb-in-eb
(e.g. ded-is juju-m k'a+i sa+km+e še-(Ø-)m-a-)l-eb-in-a 'mother's
breast enabled me to do good work'). Prescriptively the negation for the
Indirect Verb-forms will be ar, whilst that for the Transitive Verb-forms is
more likely to be ver, but the following from Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's
autobiography breaks this rule: ver-c k'i š ( Ø - ) e - ) l - o - t c'ar-mo(Ø-)e-dg-in-a-t sadil=vaxšm-is č'+a 'nor could they even imagine
the eating of lunch and dinner'. Note the cognate monovalent non-Indirect
forms: äe-i-)l-eb-a 'it is possible' => Imperfect äe-i-)l-eb-od-a 'it was
possible'; outside the Prešent Sub-Series we have to use the adjectives
še+sa+jl+o or še+sa+jl+eb+el-i 'possible' with the appropriate form of
the copula.
Be afraid = -šin- (cf. šiš-i fear')
The true Indirect Verb is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series and takes
today the Genitive of the thing feared: g-e-šin-i-a 'you are afraid' (e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a tagv-eb-is(a) 'I am afraid of mice', which, if we keep the
ModernGEORGIANplural-formation on the noun, in OldGEORGIANwould have
been m - e - š i n - i - s
tagv-eb-is(a)-gan with postposition - g a n ) =>
Imperfect g-e-šin-od-a. Outside the Prešent Sub-Series we have two
types of suffixal Intransitive Verb, both meaning simply 'experience fear':
the first is Indirect, and again we find the prescriptively unusual
association of suffixal Intransitive with the Indirect Object Version, viz.
Future še-g-e-šin-d-eb-a 'you will become alarmed' => Aorist še-g-eš i n - d - a => Perfect š e - g - š i n - e b - i - a , whilst the second is a
straightforward monopersonal suffixal Intransitive, viz. š'e-(Ø-)š'in-deb-i 'you will experience fear' => Aorist še-(Ø-)šin-d-i => Perfect š e (Ø-)šin-eb-ul-x-a+r.
As a Transitive we have: (še-)(Ø-Ø-)a-šin-eb
'you (will) frighten X/them'. There also exists in the Prešent Sub-Series
(Ø-)šiš-ob 'you are afraid', which, if need be, may take an object (ØØ-)šiš-ob 'you are afraid of X/them'. N.B. the colloquialism šiš-i (ØØ-)č'am-e 'you ate fear = you were afraid'.
Be ashamed = -rcxv(+en)- (cf. si-rcxv-il-i
'shame')
This too properly exists in only the Prešent Sub-Series and also like the
previous verb takes a Genitive of the object of shame: g-rcxv+en-i-a
'you are ashamed (of X = Genitive)' => Imperfect g - r c x v + e n - o d - a .
Outside the Prešent Sub-Series the verb simply means 'experience a feeling
of shame', viz. ä e - g - r c x v e b - a 'you will feel shame' => Aorist š e - g rcxv-a => Perfect še-g-rcxv+en-i-a. However, if the meaning is rather382GEORGIANGRAMMAR'find oneself in an embarrassing position', then this verb-form behaves like
še-(Ø-)rcxva normal monopersonal markerless Intransitive Verb (viz.
eb-i 'you will find yourself in an embarrassing position' => Aorist š e (Ø-)rcxv-i => Perfect še-(Ø-)rcxv+en-il-x-a+r). Transitively we have
(še-)(Ø-Ø-)a-rcxv-en 'you (will) make X/them ashamed'. N.B. the
colloquialism si-rcxv-il-i
(Ø-Ø-)č'-e
'you ate shame = you were
ashamed'.
Be hot = -cx- (cf. si-cx-e 'heat', cx+el-i 'hot)
g-cx+el-a 'you are hot' => Imperfect g-cx+el-od-a. Outside the Prešent
Sub-Series we have the Dynamic Indirect forms: da-g-cx-eb-a 'you will
get hot' => Aorist d a - g - c x - a => Aorist Subjunctive d a - g - c x - e - s =>
Perfect d a - g - c x + o m - i - a . When speaking of the weather we have:
cx+el-a 'it's hot' => Imperfect cx+el-od-a; in the Future we can have
(?Ø-)e-cx+el-eb-a, but outside the Prešent Sub-Series the copula tends
to be used with the noun 'heat' (e.g. si+cx+e i-kn-eb-a 'it will be hot (lit.
there will be heat)'. As a predicate for inanimate objects one has: cx+eli-a 'it is hot'. The non-Indirect suffixal Intransitive is used for inanimate
objects getting hot (viz. (ga-)cx+el-d-eb-a 'X is getting (will get) hot'). If
'Judgmental' forms are correctly classifiable as Indirect Verbs, then we
also have the Prešent-Future g-e-cx+el-eb-a (c'q'al-i) 'you (will) judge
(the water) hot' => Aorist g-e-cx+el-a (with no Series III). Transitively
there is (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-cx+el-eb 'you (will) make X/them hot', though from
this verb-form we can produce another variety of Indirect Verb in the
particular expression bavšv-s (?Ø-Ø-)a-cx+el-eb-s 'the child has a
fever', where the sufferer is the verb's indirect object 124 —N.B. 'the child
has a temperature' will be bavšv-s si+cx+e (Ø-)a-kv-s = 'the child has
heat'. Based on the above-Transitive Verb we have the (preverbless)

Be cold = -civ- (cf. si-civ-e 'cold(ness)', civ-i 'cold')
g-civ-a 'you are cold' => Imperfect g-ci-od-a. The Future Sub-Series
may be formed by adding the preverb še- (e.g. äe-g-civ-a 'you will be
cold'); alternatively, outside the Prešent Sub-Series the inceptive, formallyVERBAl MORPHOlOGY383suffixal Intransitive forms may be used: še-g-civ-d-eb-a 'you will get
cold' => Aorist š e - g - c i v - d - a => Perfect s-e-g-civ-eb-i-a.
When
speaking of the weather we have: civ-a 'it's cold' => Imperfect ci-od-a,
though outside the Prešent sub-Series the copula is used with the noun for
'cold(ness)' (viz. si+civ+e i-kn-eb-a 'it will be cold' 125 ). One can say of
an inanimate object civ-i-a 'it is cold', but to say it of a woman has the
same force as German sie is kalt 'she is frigid'. The non-Indirect suffixal
Intransitive with ga- is used of inanimate objects growing cold and of
animate entities catching cold (e.g. c'q'al-i/gogo ga-civ-d-a 'the water
became cold/the girl caught a cold126'), though for the temperature getting
cold the preverb is a- (viz. vaime, ro+gor a-civ-d-a! 'gracious, how
cold it has become!')—if še- substitutes for ga- in the non-I ndirect suffixal
Intransitive the force of the verb is softened to 'go a bit cold' (e.g q'ava
š e - c i v - e b - u l - a 'the coffee has gone a bit cold'). Transitively we
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-civ-eb 'you (will) make X/them cold' (see also examples
prešented under 'be hot').
Be warm = -tb-127 (cf. si-tb-o 'warmth', tb+il-i 'warm')
g-tb+il-a 'you are warm' => Imperfect g-tb+il-od-a. Only Prešent SubSeries forms exist. For the weather we have-, tb+il-a 'it is warm' =>
Imperfect tb+il-od-a 128 , but outside the Prešent Sub-Series one uses the
copula with the noun for 'warmth' 129 . Transitively there is (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)atb-ob 'you (will) warm X/them'. We see again the element - u n - in the
form (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-tb+un-eb 'you (will) make X/them warm (sc not by
lighting a fire but by providing a cover/bunging up holes/etc...)'. Of
inanimate objects one can say tb+il-i-a 'it is warm'.
Be in pain = -t'k'iv- (cf. t'k'iv-il-i 'pain', m-t'k'iv-n-eul-i
'painful')
g-t'k'iv-a
( t a v - i / m u c e l - i / p e x - i ) 'you have a pain (in your
head/stomach/ foot)' => I mperfect g-t'k'i-od-a 'you had a pain (in your X)'.
Outside the Prešent Sub-Series the root alters slightly to give: g-e-t'k'ineb-a 1 3 0 'you will have a pain (in your X)' => Aorist g-e-t'k'in-a => Perfect
g-t'k'en-i-a. As an Indirect inceptive we have: (a-)g-tViv-d-eb-a 1 3 1
tav-i/mucel-i/pex-i 'your head/stomach/foot starts (will start) to hurt' =>
Aorist a-g-tViv-d-a => Perfect a-g-t'k'iv-eb-i-a = a-g-t'k'iv+n-i-a.
Transitively there is: (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'k'en 'you (will) make X/them hurt for
Y/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'k'in-e => Perfect g-i-t'k'en-i-a -tvis (e.g.
šuk-ma tval-eb-i (Ø-)m-a-t'k'in-a 'the light made my eyes hurt';
k'iser-ze muc'uk'-i ar (Ø-Ø-)m-a-tVin-o! 'don't make the spot on my
neck hurt!'). When the expression 'be pained at heart' is metaphorically
used for 'being concerned',GEORGIAN,in the Prešent Sub-Series only, makes384GEORGIANGRAMMARuse of the preverb še- (e.g. rjal-s i+s+e ar še-s-t'k'iv-a mazl-is-tvis
gul-i, ro+gor-c col-s kmr-is-tvina! 1 3 2 'a daughter-in-law does not
have the same concern for her husband's brother as a wife does for her
husband').
Be hungry = -ši(v)- (cf. ši-m+š-il-i 'hunger', m+š-ier-i
'hungry', dam+š-e-ul-i 'ravenous')
g-ši-a 'you are hungry' => Imperfect g-ši-od-a => Future g-e-ši-eba/mo-g-šiv-a 1 3 3 . Otherwise the inceptive, suffixal Intransitive is used:
(mo-)g-šiv-d-eb-a 'you (will) become hungry' => Aorist mo-g-šiv-d-a =>
Perfect mo-g-šiv-eb-i-a. Transitively we have: (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-šiv-eb
or the older (mo-7da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-m+š-ev 1 3 4
'you (will) make X/them
hungry'.
Be thirsty = -c'q'ur- (cf. c'q'ur+v-il-i 'thirst')
g-c'q'ur-i-a 'you are thirsty' => Imperfect g-c'q'ur-od-a => Future g-ec'q'ur-eb-a.
Otherwise the inceptive suffixal Intransitive is used:
(mo-)g-c'q'ur-d-eb-a 'you (will) become thirsty' => Aorist mo-g-c'q'urd-a => Perfect mo-g-c'q'ur-eb-i-a. Transitively we have (mo-)(ØØ-)a-c'q'ur-eb 'you (will) make X/them thirsty'. For the Masdar m o c'q'ur-eb-a cf. mlaše sa+č'm+el-ma mo-c'q'ur-eb-a (Ø-)i-c-i-s
'salty food usually causes one to be thirsty = (lit.) knows how to make one
thirsty'.
Suppose X/them to be somewhere = -gulg-e-gul-eb-a 'you suppose X/them to be somewhere' (e.g. zurab-s
tav+is-i col-i šua dagest'an-ši (Ø-)e-gul-eb-od-a 'Zurab supposed
his wife to be in central Daghestan'). It can be synonymous with mi-g-ačn-i-a 'you deem/judge/regard X/them to be something' (e.g čem-ad me - g u l - e b - i - a n 'I deem them mine', where in this example from
C'avch'avadze we note the plural-marking on the verb of the 3rd person
Nominative nominal). Note also the expression ra-s (Ø-)m-e-gul-eb-i?
'what do you imagine I have?', which cannot be an Indirect verb-form.
Clearly there is a relationship with the Medial Verb (Ø-Ø-)gul-ob 'you
suppose/imagine/deem something' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-gul(+v)-eb => Aorist
(Ø-Ø-)i-gul(+v)-e
=> Perfect g-i-gul(+v)-eb-i-a (e.g. čongur-s tu
sim-eb-i ar da-s-c'q'd-e-s, cocxal-i (Ø-)m-i-gul-e 'if it transpires
that the strings don't snap on the chonguri, believe me to be alive').
Deem/regard/judge/suppose = -čmi-g-a-čn-i-a 'you suppose X/them to be something' (e.g. ca kud-ad arVERBAl MORPHOlOGY385mi-(Ø-)a-čn-i-a, deda+mic'a—kalamn-ad-o 'X does not suppose the
sky to be a hat, the earth a sandal, they say') => Imperfect mi-g-a-(5nd-a. Otherwise the Transitive form (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)i-šn-ev = (ša-)tvl-i 'you
(will) judge X/them to be something' is used. Note that with the preverb
ga-, namely ga-g-a-čn-i-a, we have an Indirect Verb in the Prešent
Sub-Series only meaning (i) 'you have X/them', (ii) 'you deem/judge X/them
to be something', and, (iii) 'it depends on you' (e.g. da + b o m b + v + a
da+bomb+v+a-s ga-(Ø-)a-čn-i-a = da+bomb+v+a da+bomb+v+a-ze
a+r-i(-s) da+mo+k'id+eb+ul-i 'bombing depends on the bombing').
Take pleasure in/Find pleasurable = -am- (cf. si-am-e
'feeling of

g-e-am-eb-a 'you will take pleasure in XNOM' => Aorist g - e - a m - a 1 3 5
(with no Series III). Related to the Transitive (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-am-eb 'you give
pleasure to X/themj O in respect of Y/themDO'—N.B. such colloquialism as
abano (Ø-)g-a-am-o-s! 'may the bath be beneficial for you!', jil-i (Ø-)ga-am-o-s! 'may sleep be beneficial for you!', where the unstated subject is
presumably understood to be gmert-ma 'God'. There is the parallel g-es i + a m + o v n - e b - a (cf. sa + si + am+ovn+o 'pleasurable') 'you will take
pleasure in X N O M ' => Aorist g-e-si+am+ovn-a => Perfect g-si+am+ovneb-i-a. Cf. the Transitive
(Ø-Ø-)a-si+am+ovn-eb
'you (will) give
pleasure to X/them', though in the Prešent Sub-Series a variant of this
exists without the versioniser—could an example like a+gar gsi+am+ovn-eb-s čem-i nax+v+a be interpreted as 'you no longer find
seeing me pleasurable' and thus be seen as the Prešent Sub-Series filler to
the Future g - e - s i + a m + o v n - e b - a ? The versionless active voice form
does, however, also function with Nominative subject as a synonym to
(Ø-)xar-ob = (Ø-)net'ar-eb 'you rejoice' (e.g. si + am + o v n - e b - s
q'ovel-i sul+dg+m+ul-i zapxul-ši 'every creature rejoices in summer').
Take pride in = -amaq'- (cf. amaq'-i 'proud', si-amaq'-e 'pride')
Only in the Prešent Sub-Series do we have such forms as: g - e - a m a q ' eb-a 'you take pride in X/themNOM', for otherwise the Medial is used (viz.
(Ø-)amaq'-ob 'you take pride in X/themI NST' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-amaqleb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-amaq'-e => Perfect g-i-amaq'+n-i-a).

'you give X/them Y/them to drink' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sv-i) from ( 0 0-)sv-am 'you drink X/them', allow us again to view this element as a
Thematic Suffix, though apart from these cases one could again treat roots
that combine with this exponent as synchronically belonging to the class of
Root Verbs. For a member of this sub-class derived from a noun cf. ( 0 Ø-)a-mtVr-ev 'you pulverise X/them' <= mt'ver-i 'dust'—in the case of
(Ø-Ø-)i-k'vl-ev 'you search out/research X/them' there is the noun

No example was offered above for the preverbs c ' a - / c ' a - m o - , c'abasically indicating 'forward' (cf. c'in 'in front, before, ahead'), in the
Prešent of the verb of motion. This is because such couplings are not
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. However, elsewhere in the paradigm
these preverbs do come into play, and the question arises as to how one
differentiates between, say, the Futures c'a-va and rni-va, both signifying
'X will go'. The answer is that c'a- emphasises the departure and
journeying, whilst mi- implies reaching the destination (e.g. bič'-i c'a-va
sk'ola-ši 'the lad will go to school' vs bič'-i mi-va buxar-tan 'the lad
will go upto the stove'). The same interplay is observed with the verb for
'take'—in the Prešent Sub-Series only mi- is possible, e.g.
eg c'ign-i
sad
mi-g-a-kv-s?
that book-NOM where? PREV-you-lV-take-it
'Where are you taking that book?'
whereas elsewhere the same nuances as just described attach to the
preverbs mi- and c'a-, e.g.
malamo
tan

The difference between mo- and c'a-mo- is that the former indicatesVERBAl MORPHOlOGY153simple motion towards speaker or hearer, whereas the latter implies motion
'away' towards or with speaker or hearer (e.g. mo-(Ø-)di a+k! 'come

go together!', or:

čven-c
PREV-(you-)SV-wait(I MPER) we(NOM)-tooc'a-mo-val-t
PREV-PREVcome(lst.PER)-Pl'Hold on, we'll come along too')
From their original role as markers of directionality/orientation the
preverbs took on the function of marking perfective aspect with the result
that today for the bulk of verbs in the Transitive and Intransitive classes
the relevant preverb will usually be prešent in screeves other than those
of the Prešent Sub-Series. The addition of the appropriate (and usually
unpredictable) preverb to the Prešent Indicative of most Transitive or
Intransitive verbs produces the Future Indicative (e.g. (Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s
'X does/makes Y/them' => ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s 'X will do/make Y/them').
In OldGEORGIANthere was no independent Future Indicative screeve, the
Prešent or Aorist Subjunctive as appropriate (sc. according to aspect)
making up the deficiency. The association of root with preverb can then
come to play a lexical role, for by altering the preverb from ga- to šewith the root -k'et- we produce a verb-form with the lexical meaning
'repair' (e.g. ro+di+s še-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-en a+m t'elevizor-s? 'When
will they repair this television?'), the preverbless Prešent (Sub-Series) forms
being ambiguous out of context for the meanings 'do/make' vs 'repair'.
Another example would be the verb 'kill' which normally takes the preverb
m o - (e.g. bič'-ma baq'aq'-i mo-(Ø-)k'l-a 'the lad killed the frog'), but if
the killing is with a knife (typically of an animal slaughtered in ritualistic
sacrifice or for preparation as food), then the preverb da- takes over, e.g.
dia+saxl+is-ma katam-i
da-(Ø-)k'l-a
da
housewife-ERG
chicken-NOM PREV-(it-)kill-she(AOR) and
(Ø-)gv-a-č'am-a
(it-)us-lV-feed-she(AOR)
'the housewife killed the chicken (sc. by slitting its throat) and fed it to

These couplings do not exhaust the possibilities for the root 'kill', and
the range of couplings well illustrates the way the inter-dependencies of
root and preverb (as well as Version) complicate the lexical structure of154GEORGI AN GRAMMARthe language. Consider:

Also consider (da-)(Ø-Ø-)loc-av 'you (will) bless X/them' vs (äe-/gamo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-loc-av 'you (will) mouth a healing mantra over X/them'.
The reason for the choice of preverb in most of the examples in the
previous paragraph is, I think, opaque—synonymous roots can be found
which, despite their parallel semantics, take different preverbs (e.g. da-scin-eb = ga-kird-av 'you will mock X'). Sometimes, the change can be
explained in terms of the original directional force of the preverb and the
basic lexical meaning of the root is little altered. The normal preverb for
-ngr- 'ruin' is da-, e.g.

'we always imagined there to be loaves in the chest if a harvestless

Intransitives it is usual for a preverb to be prešent in the verbal complex.
In Series II, however, and less commonly perhaps in Series III, one may
find finite Transitive (very rarely Intransitive) verbs without the expected
preverb. The nuance attaching to such forms is that an action, expressed
as aspectually non-durative (hence the use of Series II), nevertheless does
not reach its natural conclusion, which would motivate the prešence of the
preverb as marker of perfective aspect. Consider the contrast between
preverbless and preverbal forms in the proverb:

'this is not an affair that is easily to be accomplished, but it is
demanded of you that we do it' (Literary Georgia, 18 Jan 1991, p.7)At first glance this would appear to refer to a quite specific affair and
therefore to require the preverb ga-. However, the previous šentence
reads: 'It is our duty to purify the path for the national movement of all
sorts of falsehood and overpower on this road the enemy's tricks,
deceptions and illusions'. In other words, the sa + km + e in question
involves a whole series of individual actions, the fulfilment of each one of
which will not necessarily result in the completion of the series overall,
hence the lack of the preverb.
Just as in the Future Participle of the last example, the non-finite
verbal noun (Masdar) may be used without the anticipated preverb. The
following examples from a single article in the paper droni Times' (11 Oct
1991, p.7) shew how difficult it can be to distinguish between preverbal and
preverbless forms, for in both instances we have the same verbal root
dependent upon the main verb 'begin', and yet one occurrence has the
preverb, whilst the other lacks it, viz.

from the outside'
One might argue from a logical perspective that talk of the beginning of
any action cannot be the appropriate moment to emphasise perfective
aspect for the relevant activity. However, it is clearly the case that
masdars dependent on this verb more often than not will indeed carry their
preverb (cf. from the self-same article:

'X began to burn the mattresses in the cells and to hurl them outside')
If, as we have seen, it is often not possible to predict which preverb
will be employed for a given root or why a switch to another preverb
should result in the precise change of meaning that on this or that occasion
will occur, it is nevertheless true that some preverbs have come to be
associated with a particular nuance which they introduce into the
semantics of a verb-form when they replace the root's normal preverb. It
is now time to look at these interesting nuances.
In addition to the example given in the introductory section of this
chapter for Se- marking the application of the verbal action to only a
slight degree, theGEORGIANDictionary of Morphemes quotes: še-ten-d-a
'dawn broke somewhat' vs ga-ten-d-a 'dawn broke', še-šr-a 'X dried a
little' vs ga-šT-a 'X dried', še-xm-a 'X dried up a little' vs ga-xm-a 'X
dried up', še-c'itl-d-a 'X turned slightly red' vs ga-c'itl-d-a 'X turned
red', še-tvr-a 'X got a bit drunk' vs da-tvr-a 'X got drunk'.
Further examples of the parallel nuance introduced this time by m o from the same Dictionary are: mo-rbil-d-a (= še-rbil-d-a) 'X softened a
bit' vs da-rbil-d-a 'X softened', mo-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned a little bitter'VERBAl MORPHOlOGY163vs ga-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned bitter', mo-mšav-d-a 'X turned a little sour'
vs da-mžav-d-a 'X turned sour'. Also given under the same rubric are
three more denominal verbs, but this time the preverb is followed by the
Subjective Version vowel and the forms in question are restricted (at least
for the relevant meanings) to the Prešent Sub-Series, a restriction that
does not apply to the earlier examples: mo-i-junc'-eb-s 'X is somewhat
mean', mo-i-sust'-eb-s 'X is somewhat weak', mo-i-did-eb-s 'X is
somewhat big', to which can be added mo-i-k'oč'l-eb-s 'X is somewhat
lame'. Note the same initial sequence of morphemes in the (Serially
unrestricted) verbs of the following expressions: tav-s mo-i-k'at , (?+)uneb-s 'X makes him/herself out to be innocent', a synonym of which is
tav-s mo-i-sa+c'q+1-eb-s <= sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched, miserable'; cf.
tav-s mo-i-m+]in+ar-eb-s 'X pretends to be asleep' <= m + jin + are
'sleeping', tav-s mo-i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb-s 'X pretends to be dead' <=
m+k'vd+ar-i 'dead'. Keeping this same initial sequence, one can use as
the verbal root the name of a town to produce a verb-form meaning
'find/enjoy TOWN'; such verbs are often used in the past and in questions
of the type: ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-soxum-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on
in Sukhum?', ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-tbilis-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on in
Tbilisi?'.
With some Medial verbs mo- has a special function. Medišis typically
take no preverb in any Series, but the addition of mo- to any of the three
Prešent Sub-Series screeves of the relevant Medišis produces expressions
meaning 'come VERBing' (e.g. (i-)mger-i-s 'X sings' => mo-i-mger-i-s 'X
comes singing', t a m a š - o b - s 'X plays' => m o - t a m a š - o b - s 'X comes
playing', t'ir-i-s 'X cries' => mo-t'ir-i-s 'X comes crying', xox-av-s 'X
crawls' => mo-xox-av-s 'X comes crawling', Ht'v-i-s 'X seeks refuge' =>
mo-i-lt'v-i-s 'X comes seeking refuge'). One can sometimes additionally
indicate the prešence of an indirect object recipient of the verbal activity
(usually the emission of some sort of sound) simply adding a Set B affix (e.g.
q'vir-i-s 'X shouts' => mo-q'vir-i-s 'X comes shouting' => mo-h-q'vir-i-s
'X comes after/follows Y shouting (sc. at Y)', q'iv-i-s 'X crows' => moq'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing' => mo-h-q'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing at Y').
For the root -bed- 'dare' the usual preverb is ga- (as in i+s ro+gor
ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e/ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-i-bed-e? 'how did you dare that/dare (do)
that to me?'). If we change the preverb to mo-, we produce a short-hand
way of saying 'dare to come here' (e.g. ro+gor mo-(0-?0-)bed-e? =
mo+svl+a ro+gor ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e? 'how did you dare to come here?').
By using še- we produce a short-hand for 'dare to go in', though with an
indirect object attached, the verb means 'dare/deign to do/say something
to someone' (as in:164GEORGIANGRAMMAR

'the woman could not deign to ask anyone to let her spend the night (sc.

'you (will) dare/deign to do/say X/them to Y/them' (cf. the common
expression ro+gor g-e-k'adr-eb-a-t?! 'how can you say/even think of
(saying) such a thing?!').
The preverb mi- is similarly employed with the Prešent Sub-Series
screeves of some Medišis to indicate the opposite orientation (e.g. m i tamaš-ob-s 'X goes playing', mi-k'iv-i-s 'X goes screaming', mi-h-k'ivi-s 'X goes after/follows Y screaming (at Y)').
Consideration of the special functions of da- can begin with the
observation that, where a Medial's activity in the Prešent Sub-Series takes
place not hither or thither but 'all around', then da- is attached (e.g. datamaš-ob-s 'X moves around playing', but in this case when an indirect
object is prešent, the Thematic Suffix alters to give da-s-tama š-eb-s 'X
plays around Y', da-seirn-ob-s 'X walks around', da-k'unt'ruš-ob-s 'X
capers about', da-laklak-ob-s 'X goes around prattling', da-(5'or+aob-s 'X goes around spreading rumours', da-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins around,
works at speed'). When this preverb is used, there is often a hint of its
original directional force 'down' (e.g. da-s-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins/fusses
around/over Y', da-s-t'rp-i-s = da-s-t'rp+ial-eb-s 'X behaves lovingly
over/towards Y', da-h-q'iv-i-s 'X crows down at Y', da-s-t'ir-i-s 'X
looks down and cries over Y', da-gručun-eb-s 'X goes around grunting/X
grunts down over Y', da-h-q'ašq'aš-eb-s 'X (eagle, etc..) barks down at
Y', da-h-q'mu-i-s 'X moos over Y', da-mger-i-s 25 'X sings over Y', which
as a verb with a full paradigm means 'sing to the accompaniment of an
instrument', as shewn by:

da-(?0-)mger-a
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)sing-X(AOR)
'X played the pipe and sang to its accompaniment')
da- may be used in a parallel way with the Prešent Sub-SeriesVERBAl MORPHOlOGY165screeves of non-Medials too (e.g. da-e-tr-ev-a = da-e-xet'-eb-a 'X
wanders aimlessly about', da-a-č'en-eb-s 'X gallops Y (horse) around',
da-a-tr-ev-s 'X drags Y around', da-a-č'rial-eb-s 'X conveys Y (cart)
around creaking', da-a-t'ar-eb-s 'X conveys Y about', da-s-cker-i-s =
da-h-q'ur-eb-s = da-mzer-s 'X looks down upon/over Y', da-i-p'areb-a 'X lurks around like a thief', with which may be compared m o - i p'ar-eb-a 'X comes thieflike' and mi-i-p'ar-eb-a 'X goes thieflike',
though KEGl also quotes a full paradigm for this latter in the šense of
'sneak somewhere').
Perhaps the above-usages of da- might just be subsumed under the
general heading of intensification of the verbal activity, which is often
conveyed by this preverb—an action carried on in more than one direction
might be regarded as an intensification or pluralising of that action.
However, the property of intensification/pluralisation is most clearly seen
when da- substitutes for the normal preverb to underline the plurality of a
Transitive Verb's direct object or an Intransitive Verb's subject. Schmidt
devoted an early article (1957) to this very topic, styling it a South
Caucasian 'Aktionsart'. He quoted a whole list of cases, either elicited or
from KEGl, of da- substituting for other preverbs in cases of plurality
(including instances where the nuance is translateable as 'VERBing to and
from/around' and noting where plurality occasions suppletion of the verbal
root itself), observing that most often da- seems to replace ga- in
Transitive Verbs (e.g. ga-gzavn-i 'you will šend one X' vs da-gzavn-i
'you will šend them', ga-jarcv-av 'you will rob one X' vs da-jarcv-av
'you will rob them', ga-rand-av 'you will plane one X' vs da-rand-av
'you will plane them', ga-bt'q'vn-i 'you will pluck one X' vs da-bt'q'vn-i
'you will pluck them'). Prešented separately were other alternations,
including those for Intransitives (e.g. gada-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow
one X' vs da-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow them', mo-lok'-av = ga-lok'-av
'you will lick one X clean' vs da-lok'-av 'you will lick them clean', m o - h p'ar-av 'you will steal one X from Y' vs da-h-p'ar-av 'you will steal
them from X', mo-k'1-av 'you will kill one X' vs (with change of root!) daxoc-av 'you will kill them', ga-ǰavr-d-eb-a 'X will grow angry' vs daǰavr-d-eb-i-an 'they will grow angry'). Schmidt observed that in addition
to marking the plurality of a direct object, the prešence of da- might
indicate that the verbal activity is applied more than once to the single
object or that the single object ends up in many pieces (e.g. ga-xetk 'you
will split one X' vs da-xetk 'you will split them/one X many times', ga-t'ex
'you will break one X' vs da-t'ex 'you will break them/one X into many
pieces').
gada- may replace a root's normal preverb to indicate that the verbal166GEORGI AN GRAMMARaction is carried out thoroughly or to excess or for a second time, in which
last instance it equates to 're-' (e.g. da-xarǰ-av 'you will spend X/them' =>
gada-xarǰ-av 'you will overspend X/them', da-gl-i 'you will tire X/them'
=> gada-gl-i 'you will overtire X/them', da-a-mlaš-eb 'you will make
X/them (over-)salty' => g a d a - a - m l a š - e b 'you will make X/them
excessively salty/will overstep the mark', da-c'v-av 'you will burn X/them'
=> gada-c'v-av 'you will burn X/them to a cinder', ga-sinǰ-av 'you will
examine X/them' => gada-sinǰ-av 'you will examine thoroughly/re-examine
X/them', mo-xn-av 'you will plough X/them' => gada-xn-av 'you plough
thoroughly/re-plough X/them', da-a-muša-v-eb 'you will work X/them
over' => gada-a-muša-v-eb 'you will re-work X/them', d a - a - r k m - e v
'you will give a name to X/them' => gada-a-rkm-ev 'you will re-name
X/them', i-t'q'v-i 'you will say X/them' => g a d a - t k v - a m 'you will
renounce what you said', i-pikr-eb 'you will think' => gada-i-pikr-eb
'you will change your mind', i-angariš-eb 'you will work out a sum' =>
gada-i-angariå-eb 'you will re-do a sum).
gada- may also indicate the superficiality of the verbal action (e.g
xel-s da-i-ban 'you will wash your hands' => xel-s gada-i-ban 'you will
give your hands a cat-lick', da-a-tval+ier-eb 'you will look over/examine
X/them' => gada-a-tval+ier-eb = tval-s gada-a-vl-eb 'you will give
X/them a cursory inspection').
While not lending any special nuance, the preverb a- is especially
common, though not unique, as the perfectivising exponent for Intransitive
inceptive verbs formed from Medial roots (e.g. i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' => a-lap'arak'-d-eb-i 'you will begin to speak', i-mger-eb 'you
will sing' => a-mger-d-eb-i 'you will start to sing', i-t'ir-eb 'you will cry'
=> a-t'ir-d-eb-i 'you will start to cry').
The preverb c'a- in combination with the Subjective Version vowel is
especially common with Medial roots to indicate the marginal
accomplishment of the verbal action and will be re-prešented at greater
length in the description of the Medials (e.g. with the Medial i-sauzm-eb
'you will have breakfast' => c'a-i-sauzm-eb 'you will snatch a bit of
breakfast' compare the non-Medial č'am 'you (will) eat X/them' => c'a-ič'am 'you snatch a bite to eat').
c'a- may also serve to indicate that the activity affects the end or
edge of something (e.g. mo-s-č'r-i = mo-a-č'r-i 'you will cut X off Y' =>
c'a-a-č'r-i = c'a-s-č'r-i 'you will cut a small piece X off the end of Y',
mo-s-č'am = mo-a-č'am 'you will eat X off Y' => c'a-s-č'am 'you will eat
top/bottom X off Y', mi-a-b-am 'you will tie X to Y' => c'a-a-b-am 'you
will tie X onto the end of Y thereby extending Y', mi-a-c'eb-eb 'you will
glue X onto Y' => c'a-a-c'eb-eb 'you will glue X onto the end of Y therebyVERBAl MORPHOlOGY167extending Y').
There seems to be a roughness or something uncomplimentary involved
when c'a- replaces ga-mo- in the case of ga-mo-a-rtm-ev 'you will
take X off Y' vs c'a-a-rtm-ev 'you will snatch X off Y'.
The preverb c'a-mo- can also indicate the restricted nature of the
verbal activity (e.g. i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' => c'a-mo-c'vim-s 'there
will be a short rainfall', ga-i-zrd-eb-a 'X will grow' => c'a-mo-i-zrd-eba 'X will grow a bit', k'b+il-i a-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to
ache' => k'b+il-i c'a-mo-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to give
you a little pain'). Note, however, c'a-mo-d'arxl-d-eb-i 'you will turn
beetroot red' <= č'arxal-i 'beetroot'.
c'a-mo- is often found with the Subjective Version vowel, especially
with basically Medial roots, indicating the sudden and swift nature of the
activity (e.g. c'a-mo-i-jax-eb 'you will suddenly shout out', i-q'ep-eb-s
'X will bark' => da-i-q'ep-eb-s 'X will give a bark' => c ' a - m o - i - q ' e p eb-s 'X will suddenly let out a bark'). But this nuance is not limited to
Medial derivatives (e.g. da-i-c'q'-eb 'you will begin X/them' vs c'a-moi-c'q'-eb 'you will suddenly begin X/them', a-i-nt-eb-a 'X will light up' vs
c'a-mo-i-nt-eb-a 'X will suddenly light up').
Perhaps the most interesting case of a special nuance attaching to a
preverb concerns š e - m o - (sometimes just še-). This preverb shews that
the verbal action is committed by an unwilling agent (see Potsxishvili 1969;
Dzhorbenadze 1983:96-97), and not only does še-mo- replace the verb's
normal preverb but the active Transitive Verb is made Intransitive
(passive) and the unwilling agent is reprešented as indirect object of this
Intransitive verb-form, sometimes in association with the e-versioniser and
in other cases with the locative Version-vowel depending on the
intransitive morphology characteristic of that root, as will be explained
later in this chapter (e.g. mo-v-k'1-av 'I shall kill X' => š e - m o - m - a k'vd-eb-a 'I shall unwittingly kill X', which Intransitive is based on m o k'vd-eb-a 'X will die' rather than on mo-i-k'vl-eb-a 'X will be killed';
ga-cvet 'you will wear out X/them' => še-mo-g-a-cvd-eb-a = še-mog-e-plit-eb-a = š e - m o - g - e - x - e v - a = š e - m o - g - e - p x r i c ' - e b - a 'you
will unwittingly wear/tear X/them to rags'; da-a-mt'vr-ev 'you will
shatter X/them' => š m o - g - e - m t ' v r - e v - a = še-mo-g-e-msxvr-ev-a =
še-mo-g-e-pšvn-eb-a 'you will unwittingly shatter X/them'; da-xarǰ-av
'you will spend X/them' => še-mo-g-e-xarǰ-eb-a = še-mo-g-e-č'ameb-a 'you will unwittingly spend X/them'; ga-tl-i 'you will whittle X/them'
=> še-mo-g-e-tl-eb-a 'you will unwittingly whittle X/them'; da-č""r-i 'you
will wound X/them' => še-mo-g-e-č'r-eb-a 'you will unwittingly wound X';
ga-lanjg-av 'you will insult X/them' => še-mo-g-e-lanjg-eb-a 'you will168GEORGI AN GRAMMARunwittingly insult X'; ga-t'ex 'you will break X/them' => še-(mo-)g-at'q'd-eb-a 'you will unwittingly break X/them'; ga-lax-av 'you will beat
up X/them' => še-mo-g-e-lax-eb-a 'you will beat X up without meaning
to'; ga-a-kr-ob 'you will extinguish a light' => åe-mo-g-a-kr-eb-a 'you
will unwittingly extinguish a light').
No mention has yet been made of the alternative forms of some of the
preverbs from the earlier list. In general the variants, each with a
bracketed extra letter, reprešent the older forms of the relevant preverbs.
Occasionally the older form is retained with certain verb-forms, sometimes
both the older and the newer forms will be in use, though there will either
be a difference in meaning or the older form will lend an archaic flavour or
higher style to the form in question.
For ag- we can note that ag+dg+om+a is retained in the šense of
'Easter' whereas the Masdar for 'standing up' today is a-dg-om-a; agk'vec-a indicates 'blessing into the priesthood', whilst a-k'vec-a is today
'shortening (e.g. someone's hair)'; ag+c'er+il+oba is the only word for
'description'. Often forms with the older variant are possible even in the
Prešent Sub-Series (a) for roots never found without this preverb, or (b)
where ag- in the Prešent Sub-Series contrasts with a- elsewhere (e.g. agnišn-av-s 'it means X', ag-ricx-av-s = ag-nusx-av-s 'X enumerates
Y/them', ag-beč'd-av-s 'X leaves behind an imprint of Y', ag-a-gzneb-s = ag-a-nt-eb-s 'X fires/rouses Y/them' vs a-a-gzn-eb-s = a-ant-eb-s 'X will fire/rouse Y/them'). According to the Dictionary of
Morphemes, because of confusion about word-divisions as the older form
was shifting to the newer, the back fricative became attached as part of
the root in a number of cases (such as mi-a-g(+)c'-ev 'you will reach
X/them'—the writer D. K'ldiashvili, who died as late as 1931, used the
original form of the root, as in ra+t'om mi-a-c'-i-a a+m dge-mde?
'why did X survive upto this day?'; in olderGEORGIAN'I confess/
acknowledge' was ag-v-i-a+r-eb, whereas today it is v-a-g(+)i(+)a(+)reb—KEGl has for its entry of 3rd person singular Prešent-Future, Aorist
and Perfect forms: agiarebs, agiara, aguarebia, with the added note in
brackets [and not: agviarebs, ... ugiarebial; V. Topuria and I.
Gigineishvili's 1968 Orthographic Dictionary, on the other hand, gives the
Perfect as: u g i a r e b i a , which can only be analysed as:
(Ø-)ug(+)i(+)a(+)r-eb-i-a, in harmony with the re-interpreted Prešent-Future
form given above).
Similar observations and examples are possible in the case of gan- (e.g.
'hermit' may only be gan+deg+il-i; 'persecution' is gan+d+ev+n+a-, one
way of saying 'X traversed a path' is to say gza ga-(Ø-)i-a+r-a, but with
the alternative root the preverb must be gan-, namely gza gan-(Ø-)vl-o).","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187]"
