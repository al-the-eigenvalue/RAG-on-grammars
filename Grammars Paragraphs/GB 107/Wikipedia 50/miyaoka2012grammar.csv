though not necessarily, out of shyness. This is not only the case with children.
11. Pragmatically, however, the use of this negative particle may be more or less
avoided, especially where definite negation could not be guaranteed (as in future
events or happenings), in favor of some hedgings such as naamiki I dont know, I
am not sure, aipaagni perhaps (fifty-fifty; aipa-agni partner-LOC.3du.sg.).",[221]
"Double and partial negation.............................................................. 1285Negation
Negation in CAY is mostly clausal with a verb-elaborating VVn suffix involved, except for a few privative verbalizing NV suffixes like NV |ƾLW-| to
lack, have no N, there be no N (§ 38.1) and apart from for one negative sentence word (particle) |qa(a)ƾ| ~ |qàƾD| no (§ 53.2). There are no affixes for
word negation (like English un-, im-, -less). Ignorative stems (§ 15.3.2) may be
contextually negative as well as interrogative and indefinite. See also (§ 40.2.5)
for the ignorative complex transitive VVcm suffixes.
A fair number of VVn suffixes are listed below, many of which have some
fusion with tense-aspect or modality. The most general and common negator is
VVn |-nћլit-| not and its variant |+1pѠkѠ-~+vѠkѠ-| (first in the list below), the
latter of which is selected by appositional-mood verbs characterized by the
mood marker |-na-| (instead of |-lu-|)  see § 51.1.3.
Except for |-at-| (second in the list below) which is very much limited to a
small group of stems and suffixes, all VVn suffixes are composites, with two or
more morphemes fused together. Even the most general and neutral negator
VVn |-nћլit-| is a composition of the abstract nominalizer VNnm |-nћլ-|
(§ 18.3.1.1) followed by the privative NV |ƾLW-| (just above), while VVn
|-nћլiћլ-| no longer is of the same nominalizer followed by the privative NV
|+ƾLћլ-| to have N removed (§ 38.1). All the others also contain the negative
element |ƾLW-|, although the exact morphological and semantic relationships
with positive counterparts (if any) may hardly be obvious.
There are a few valency-modifying suffixes, that is, two that add A IMP
(VVsm) and one with a complex transitive (VVcm) at the end.

adjectival verb stems. A peculiarity of these /t/-final negative suffixes is that

fricativizes the negative-final consonant (§ 37.2.1).

"A negative marker can follow the future. Although the negative future is typically indicated by VVn |+1ƾ DLW-| will not (§ 44), the future suffix may occur

There seems to be no restriction upon the kinds of verbal category that can be
contained in appositional moods, including modality (e.g. pi-yugnaq-luni he
probably doing s.t.) and evidentiality (e.g. pi-llini-luku evidently doing it), etc.
1.3. Negative appositionals
The negative appositional mood marker |-1na-| occurs in place of |+lu-| after
(generally) negative suffixes and a few non-negative ones. The subscript 1 deletes a stem-final apical if (P5i) applies (with some caveats below):
i) Negative suffixes  include a) verbal elaborating suffixes of negation
(VVn; § 44) and b) a few verbalizing privative suffixes (NV; § 38.1). Except for
one VVn suffix |-at-|, all of them end in /it/, and the /i/ is replaced by /u/ in
many dialect areas.

extended stems with negative suffixes like |asiit-| to be bad (from |asiћլ-| to
be good), but excluding the general negator |-nћլit-| not (composite suffix

Ignoratives are a class of morphologically diverse words, functionally common,
however, in that they are required in content questions (§ 5.3.1) in which the
head verb selects the interrogative mood (§ 48), and they may subsume not only
ignorative uses (e.g. where, § 15.2) but also non-interrogative uses, i.e. indefinite (somewhere, § 15.3.1) and negative (nowher, § 15.3.2).
There are six ignorative stems, two nominals, two ambivalent, and two particles:

The three of them |na-| where, |ca-| (to do) what, and |ki(t)-| who have a
limited extent of denominal derivation.
Either nominally or verbally, they inflect only to a limited extent and not all
in the same way. While |ca-| what and |ki(t)-| who inflect for number and
case, |qavciћլ-| how many and |na-| where inflect only for case (but the latter
like adverbial demonstratives). The expanded (nominal) ignorative stems
|na(t)-|, etc. that are derived from |na-| where inflect for person (possessor) 
see § 12.3.3 for |+t-| selected by adverbial demonstrative stems to derive location nouns.
A verbally inflected ignorative word in the interrogative mood functions by
itself as a content (or wh-) question. This is also the case for interrogative clauses that consist of the ignorative |qaillun| how or |ca-| (to do) what and the
generic bivalent stem |pi-| to do; thing (§ 10.3.1) in the causal-connective,
appositional, or participial mood.
Ignorative words used in conjunction with an interrogative-mood verb |pi-| 
e.g. pi-a (INT.3sg.) just below  are frequently used as a kind of set phrase for
expressing uncertainty (e.g. I am not sure how, I cant really say how [but...])
besides their use in asking questions (e.g. how does he, whats wrong with
him?):

"Non-interrogative uses4573. Non-interrogative uses
When co-occurring with a non-interrogative mood verb, most of the ignorative
words are non-interrogative, i.e. indefinite or negative (some or no).
While the ignorative pronoun ki-na (ABS.sg.) in (a) and (b) below is interrogative (who) with interrogative-mood inflection (-a INT.3sg.), it is indefinite (someone) in (c) with an indicative verb (-uq IND.3sg.), and negative (no

CAY comparison includes three types  comparative (e.g. to be bigger than;
§ 45.1), superlative (to be the biggest; § 45.2), as well as equalitive (to be as
big as; § 45.6)  each of which uses different morphological strategies with
different VVc suffixes as indices, although they are morphologically related
with each other. The general pattern they follow is summarized by:
COMPAREE NP + STANDARD NP + PARAMETER-INDEX-VERB.INFLECTIONABSLOC / REL / EQLINTRANSITIVE / TRANSITIVEIt is remarkable that CAY comparative, superlative, and equalitive clauses
are not only an intransitive construction but can also be a transitive one
(Miyaoka 2004b, 2009), which is implied by the subscript REL for the standard
NP in the above pattern. The predicate has a verb stem as the parameter (to be
big), which may not only be stative but also be inchoative (to become/be
now bigger than, to become/be now as big as). This means a four-way contrast,1288 Comparison
that is, intransitive/transitive and the stative/inchoative distinguished by the
composite suffixes as indices which are all morphologically related with each
other.
The comparative index is based upon the person-inflected abstract nominalization by VNnm |-nћլ-| ~ |-Ѥћլ-| (§ 18.3.2), while the equalitive index is based on
the equalitive VVc |+ta-| (§ 45.6.1) and its deverbalized VN |+ta+(u)t-|. As
partly described in § 18.3.2, the indices are a kind of relational verb construction, either intransitive or transitive (§ 37), which reverbalizes comparative and
equalitive phrases. In addition, a few isolated lexical expressions of comparison
will be mentioned: |anaћc-| to surpass, |ayuqѠ-| to resemble, be similar to
(§ 45.9), e.g. (37).
As the pattern above implies, CAY comparative constructions are not socalled conjoined comparatives that consist of one clause containing the
comparee NP and the other containing the standard NP, cf. a very rare construction like (24), however. Furthermore, the transitive constructions are utterly
distinct from those types known in many languages that employ (free) transitive
verbs meaning to exceed or to surpass for their index, and from the type that
uses a valency-increasing affix such as from or in opposition to. Note, however, that the secundative ditransitive stem for to exceed, surpass (i.e. |cipѠc-|)
is the most productive device for non-round numerals in CAY (§ 14.3.1). See
Stassen (1985, 2008) and Dixon (2008) for cross-linguistic typology of comparison constructions.
1. Comparative degree
Clauses of comparative degree or comparative clauses  like your boat is bigger than mine/my boat  are expressed with a comparee NP (your boat) in the
absolutive case and by a standard of comparison NP (mine or my boat) either i) in the locative (for intransitive constructions  § 45.1.1), or ii) in the relative case (for transitive constructions  § 45.1.2). The parameter (big) is expressed by the verb stem of a predicate, which is expanded by a VVc suffix for
the index (more, er). 11.","[1338, 1339, 1340]"
"3. Functions
The nuclei of a clause are formed of a verb and nominal(s), i.e. inflecting words,
and even though non-inflecting words are restricted or almost devoid in derivation and inflection, they are highly important in the actual functioning of the
language and carry multifarious and subtle and obscure nuances that are often
hard to define. The semantic interactions of a non-inflecting word with another
lexical item or a grammatical form result in a wide variety, so elusive as to defy
exact definition.
CAY has a fair number of non-inflecting words that are interjective/exclamative or of adverbial nature, but they are not the kind of words that constitute
such phrasal verbs as abound in English (e.g., to put off, turn down).
The language has no prepositional or postpositional particles either, the
functions of which are well handled by an abundance of location nouns and
demonstratives in an oblique case (§ 11.2 and § 12). It has hardly any subordinate conjunctions (conjunctional non-inflecting words) either, although there
are a few coordinating-conjunctional particles or enclitics whose occurrence is
highly frequent. Its near lack of subordinate conjunctions (e.g. because, when,
if, etc.) is partly related to its highly developed system of connective-mood and
appositional-mood verbs (§ 50 and § 51).
Though with the strong reservation that the distinctions are, by necessity,
more or less elusive and obscure in many instances, CAY particles may be classified for the sake of convenience as follows:

§ 53, § 54.1, § 54.4
§ 53.6, § 54One and the same particle may naturally have different functions that belong
to two or more groups. Some interjective/exclamative and adverbial particles
are more or less conjunctional. The particle |tawaam| (§ 53.5), for instance, can1508 Non-inflecting words in general
be conjunctional (but), adverbial (delimiting only), discoursive, or implicative of indirectness, as below.
The use of some non-inflecting words (sentence-adverbial and interjective/exclamative ones in particular) makes into narratives sentences that otherwise would be mere statements. This implies that those words are almost obligatory in connection with participial-mood verbs (§ 47) and are very often
required by optative-mood constructions (§ 49).
4. Two exclamative particlizers
There are two verb particlizers (VPc), the first of which is very commonly used.
4.1. VPc |+1paa|
The postvocalic variant is |+1vaa|, cf. § 7.2-i.c. Added to a verb stem, the suffix
uniquely particlizes to form a non-argumental exclamation. It is most likely that
the suffix is related to the augmentative NN suffix |+paћ-| (§ 20.1.1) and to the
intensifying VVa suffixes |+1pakaћլ-| so much and |+1paћ-| intensely
(§ 41.3.2), which, inflected in the interrogative mood, are also responsible for
exclamations with arguments involved. The doubled vowel presumably may
reflect the word-final doubling very common to vocatives by which one addresses a person with some distance or in an exaggerated way (§ 4.3-vi.c).
Very often with adjectival and negative stems:
(21) a. assii-paa!
puqia-paa!
b. kiircess-vaa! ~ kiirce-paa!how bad! (|asiit-|, cf. P5.ia)

(Dis)honorific (or attitudinal) expressions ......................................... 189
Word taboos........................................................................................ 189
Word play ........................................................................................... 191Yupik speakers are highly sensitive to indirectness/politeness and reserve/restraint in speech and to interpersonal attitudes as to whom or what to speak
about. In general they tend to be averse to explicit reference or to overtly or
directly expressing ones own desires or judgments. The people are characteristically more reserved in expressing emotion, according to Orr and Orr [QNMC
373]. Elusive reference is commonly adopted in songs.
On the other hand they are fond of joking with each other, especially with a
particular kinship group (cross cousins in particular) by using (dis)honorific
suffixes (§ 20.3).
Sociolinguistic aspects are relevant or even crucial to make adequate selections
of linguistic features in daily utterances, not just lexical but also grammatical 
especially of particular suffixes, enclitics, and verbal moods.
Hensel et al. (1983) and Hensel (1996) have extremely detailed observations
on conversational pragmatics and anthropological linguistic information about
the Yupik people. Kwachka and Basham (1990), as their research on English
texts written by the college-level native students, describe some Yupik discourse patterns that encode the native social values.
1. Hedging
Linguistic hedging in GCAY, the avoidance of definite or too precise statements, commitments, direct mentions, or personal opinions, is extensively followed by deliberately selecting one of the devices available.
The hedging practice is not merely concerned with a special set of words or
phrases in the language to be used in certain situations but is a matter of the
normal and common way of speaking in almost any situation in the daily life of
Yupik people irrespective of when, where, or to whom a person is speaking.
The use of direct or definitive phrasing, particularly with regard to personal
feelings or future events, would not be well received by conservative speakers188 Sociolinguistic notes
 cf. Morrow (1990). Sensitivity to indirectness / politeness and reserve / restraint is an important feature of the language that permeates many aspects 
morphological, syntactic, and lexical  of its structure. There are a good number
of grammatical and lexical strategies that conspire to avoid directness, specification, or assertion in speech. They also serve to show respect particularly to elders.
In constructing a word or a sentence, speakers will tactfully choose:
i) verb moods (§ 46 ~ § 51); see e.g. |-1cu(a)-| (§ 50.7)
ii) subject persons  disguised person of the third for the first or second or
of the plural for the singular (§ 32.3.2), possibly related to use of the locative case to refer to a first or second person argument (§ 27.4) and to
avoidance of vocatives by final vowel doubling to an elder or respected
person (§ 31.1).
iii) highly elaborate system of demonstrative such as |u-| this (§ 12.2.3.5-i)
iv) particles (§ 53)
v) enclitics  e.g. |=kin|, |=kiћլ|, |=ћuћլ| (§ 54)
vi) various kinds of verb elaborating suffixes  e.g. VVa |-qaћլ-| just, merely, politely, VVm |+1caaqѠ-| but actually, VVt |+niaћլ-| so that, soon,
VVe |-Ѥini-| I see in addition to attitudinal or (dis)honorific suffixes
(§ 20.3)
vii) more or less set expressions of less assertive or possitive answers in
combination with a verb or a nominal  e.g. aipaagni may or may not,
fifty-fifty; lit. in one of the two (§ 5-fn. 11, § 11.4.3, § 40[179]),
piyukuvet if you (sg.) like (§ 50.6), pillilria=wa it may/could be so,
perhaps he did (§ 47(4)), or the like
viii) frequent use of the semantically neutral or expletive pro/prop word |pi-|
to do; one (§ 10.3.1-ii, § 34.7-ii,§ 51.3 etc.) instead of a concrete word
(e.g. § 51.3.1)
ix) avoidance or very infrequent use of the strong negative particle |qàƾa|
no! which sounds too direct or blunt (as compared with English no,
for instance) and may commonly be supplanted by such indirect or evasive or non-commital particles as naam(ell) or naamiki(ka) I dont
know. The very common particle |ii=i| yes (§ 53.2) is most frequently
replaced by non-verbal quick eylid movement upward, shyly among
children in particular.
x) use of informal nicknames (§ 11.6.1-i).
By selecting one or more of these pragmatic softeners unconsciously
(unintentionally) or not, a Yupik speaker normally cushions himself from the
effect(s) that an utterance might otherwise bring about on the addressee and
some non-human beings, thereby maintaining adequate psychological aloofness.","[239, 240]"

although it also has a non-optative use (§ 49.7) with a declarative force, like the
indicative (§ 46) and the participial (§ 47) moods.
A third or a first person subject optative-mood verb is used to ask for permission or consent from the addressee concerning the person, possibly with a
reply, either positive or negative, being expected.
The second person optative can specifically be regarded as an imperative
verb for command or prohibition. The subject should be an A or Sa argument,
which typically has controllability.
Negative optatives are prohibitional.
An optative verb by itself generally sounds too direct, strong, or impolite to
be used except in limited situations. A number of devices can, however, soften
the effect:
a) the third person is used instead of the first or the second person (disguised
person § 12.2.3.5, § 32.3.2)
b) periphrastic constructions with |pi-| verb are used (§ 49.4.2, § 51.3)
c) a number of non-inflecting words and suffixes tend to be selected by the
optative mood that give different connotations to the verb, like enclitic =tuq,Inflection 1363=kin, =ggem, =gguq (§ 54), and particle qaa, ampi, atak(i), atek, ikik, kitak(i),
etc. (§ 53). See also |-1ki-| (§ 49.5, § 49.7).
Inflectional morphology of the optative mood is more fluctuating and varied
than the other moods, and this is partly due to personal preferences, so the full
spectrum of nuances and details is beyond convering in this chapter.
1. Inflection
The inflection of an optative-mood verb consists of a mood marker followed
either by a subject person marker if intransitive, or a subject-object marker if
transitive. The mood marker differs depending upon the subject person, as is the
case with the interrogative mood.

"2. Third-person optatives

positive or negative, or to merely express the speakers wish concerning the

(73)1.pi-li-nguaq
thing-make-imitation.ABS.sg.  cf. (69) ca-nguaq
artwork (e.g. animal or person carved from walrus ivory or bone).
The suffix may perhaps be a reflection of a very deep-rooted perception in CAY
culture. The English gloss (imitation, copy, fake, pretention) might sound like a
negative or (even) derogatory concept; but the suffix may be better understood as
reflecting a positive significance of identification with when man and nature (nonhuman world) are merged in harmony, given, for instance, the ways in which
a -nguaq or -nguar-ing (imitation) is used and done in various aspects of traditional
life (particularly in ceremonies like the elriq or memorial feast). The word (69) canguaq mask is also used as a very important item connecting man with nature.",[712]
"These appositional forms may be of cosubordinate use, thus also meaning (a)
(you) not leaving, (b) (you) not doing, (c) not doing slowly, etc., while the
optative forms such as pi-viiq-naci and ner-yaqu-naku, for instance, with the
same negative marker |-1na-| are only used for prohibition (you [pl.]) dont be
doing [continuously]! and (you [sg.]) dont eat it!, without any cosubordinate
use.",[1535]
"680 Nominal elaborations
In this connection it could also be conceivable that the suffix has extended
its function to serve as the linker (LNK) |+(V)ћլ-| by which loanwords are
brought into native inflection  see § 52.3.2.
3. (Dis)honorifics (HNR) (NNh/VVh)
(Dis)honorific or attitudinal suffixes (HNR) occur very frequently in CAY
speech. They may only be employed to someone who is (well) known to the
speaker, very often jokingly to cousins and children, but not to elders.
Morphologically being NN or VV suffixes, they do not simply provide a
semantic elaboration on the preceding nominal or verb stem, but rather express
some attitude, feeling, evaluation, politeness, etc. of the speaker towards the
person(s) or thing(s) concerned, which can be either:
(a) positive  expressing endearment or attachment, admiration, praise,
and politeness, or
(b) negative  expressing hatred and insults, criticism, and denial.
The attitude expressed by one and the same suffix, however, may be ambivalent, either positive or negative.
As an NN type, the attitude is expressed toward the referent of the noun
stem. As a VV stem, it is directed toward the argument, typically a person, but it
may be a thing connected with the verbal action. As a verb elaborating type,
they are taken as a kind of modality suffixes (cf. § 43.1).
Characteristically, a (dis)honorific suffix occurs after nominal stems, including common nouns, personal names, nominal demonstratives, and personal pronouns. Though rarely, it also occurs after attributive nouns, numerals, nonpersonal pronouns, and deverbalizations (relative and nominal clauses) 
akalla-cungaq, pingayu-cungaat, uquri-lria-cungaq from akallar- old one,
pingayut- three, qaku when (FUT), uquri-lria- one who is fat.
Frequent co-occurrence of a (dis)honorific suffix with a nominal demonstrative is the most remarkable feature of (dis)honorific suffixes. As described in
§ 12.2.1, nominal demonstratives (and the only nominal interrogative |ki(t)-|
who; § 15.2.2) have three different kinds of stems characterized by three expanders added to the demonstrative roots as: a.) |+u-| selected by singular
nominals (except for ones in the absolutive case; cf. c.)); and singular-subject
verbs, b.) |+ku-| selected by non-singulars; and c.) |+na-| selected by the
absolutive singular case.
In view of their morphology, (dis)honorific suffixes behave somewhat differently than productive suffixes do in general in that, despite being suffixes,
they are characteristically nomadic, that is, they float among words of different classes (somewhat like clitics), though in a far from uniform way. This im-(Dis)honorifics (HNR) (NNh/VVh) 681plies that they may occur interchangeably after nominal (incl. vocative) and
verb stems, but also very often after particles, although there can be a slight
difference in emphasis or implication depending upon which word it occurs in
or which morpheme it is attached to. They may also be repeated, occurring both
in a noun and a verb, or in two or more words of a sentence. At least one suffix
(|-ћլuћլluћլ-|) floats even within words, relative to other suffixes.

evaluative morphemes that float, and are usually diminutive or augmentative. 77.","[731, 732, 733]"
"102 Morphological preliminaries
fixes involved. A good number of apparently ambivalent stems in CAY (listed
in § 10.4) may not be a problem to be dealt with using the so-called zeroderived transcategorial conversions.
i) Stem and inflection  Only one stem occurs in each word (as stated). The
single-stem principle is very strict in CAY word formation, implying the complete avoidance of stem compounding apart from a few cases of phrasal compounds (single words, as stated) as morphological anomalies (§ 2.3, § 4.3.6) and
of noun incorporation as a means of compounding noun and verb stems.
Inflection, which consists of one, two, or three inflectional suffixes that are
often fused, encodes the obligatory categories of:
a. mood and person (subject and object) for verbs  § 32
b. case, number, and person (possessor) for nominals  § 21 through § 29.
ii) Derivation  Between the stem and the inflection there may optionally
occur another constituent, i.e. one or more derivational suffixes. The order of
the three constituents cannot be permutated.
Thus the structure of inflecting words  nominals (N) and verbs (V)  is represented by example (1) above and exemplified by (2) and (3), etc.
In CAY, tense-aspect is optionally provided by verbal derivation (verbelaborating VVt suffixes; § 42) or lexically by some particles. Modality and
evidentiality are likewise provided optionally by verb elaborating suffixes
(modal VVm; § 43) or by some particles but also partly an inflectional category
(for illocutionary force; declaratives, interrogatives, imperatives, and optatives,
see § 46 through § 49). Polarity or verbal negation (VVn) is expressed by negative suffixes (§ 44).
iii) Two kinds of suffixes  derivational and inflectional, the former of which
forms a semi-closed class and the latter a closed class, are morphologically distinct. While derivational suffixes are a lexical means of creating new words,
they also have extensive syntactic relevance. The notion that derivational suffixes are unproductive while inflectional ones are productive is totally alien to
CAY. Concerning the distinction between the two, Mithun (1983: 238) once
suggested that expressions which speakers of the language may have thought to
be more important at one stage have been morphologized into (derivational)
suffixes while the most important ones that they determined to be obligatory
have been morphologized into inflections.
iv) Roots  A good number of stems cannot be followed directly by inflections unless immediately expanded by one of a limited number of (derivational)
suffixes. They are referred to as roots (§ 10.5) and the expanding suffixes as
root expanders (EX), some of which are specific to roots while others are not.
A root followed by a root expander functions as a stem (root-derived stem;Word and its constructions103§ 36), which then can be followed by inflections with or without intervening
derivational suffix(es).
It is to be noted that many roots are more or less indeterminate as to being
either nominal or verbal  see § 10.5. Verbal roots have no valency, i.e. avalent. All demonstratives (§ 12) and some ignoratives (§ 15.2) begin with
roots. Demonstrative roots are expanded into nominal, adverbial, and verbal
demonstrative stems by their particular expanders (§ 12.2, § 12.3, § 12.4).
2.2.1. Morpheme shapes and suffix types
Stems and suffixes end either in a vowel (V, /ܺ/, VV), an apical stop (/t, c/), or a
velar (/ܵ, ܵࡆ, x, [ ҕ/), while demonstrative roots end in /m, n, ƾ, k, ܵ, w, t/ as well
as /u/  see § 3.2 for vowel inventory and § 3.3 for consonant.
Stem-final segments as well as suffix-initial and -final segments trigger different segmental adjustments (§ 7).
i) Morpheme-initial/final segments
i.a) velars: Some suffix-initial velars /k/, /ܵ/, /ܵࡆ/, /ƾ/ and some morphemefinal /ܵࡆ/, which behave differently from others, are called strong. The suffixinitial strong velars are marked with an asterisk (*) after the velar in phonological representations, e.g. NNh |-k*ayaћլ-| darn, mean, VVm |+1ƾ*at-| maybe  see iii.a) below for the plus + (retaining) and the minus  (deleting) and
iii-b for subscript 1.
The morpheme-final distinction between strong and weak /ܵࡆ/ occurs only in nominal stems or suffixes and only after single full vowels, while all the
other final /ܵࡆ/ are strong. So the asterisk marking is only made for a strong /ܵࡆ/
following a single full vowel (V), e.g. |tanћu[̙aћլ*-| boy, participial |+1ƾuћլ*-|
(vs. |qayaћլ-| kayak). The other morpheme-final strong /ܵࡆ/ is not so marked.
The morpheme-final distinction of the back velar /ܵࡆ/ fluctuates somewhat, as
some speakers use a strong (or weak) velar in place of the more general weak
(or strong) one  e.g. ciir-e-t ~ cii-t sheefish (inconnu), the latter of which,
reflecting a weak velar, may sound like baby talk.
All the nominal-final front velar /ܵ/ are strong, hence no asterisk marking for
them.
i.b) apicals: The final /t/ occurs only in a number of adjectival verb stems
(e.g. |mikѠt-| ~ |mikѠ-| to be small, |asiit-| to be bad) and privative and negative suffixes (e.g. NV |+ƾit-| to have no and VVn |-nћլit-| not), while the final
/c/ occurs only in verbal stems and suffixes (e.g. |kic-| to sink, |+kic-| to give
s.o.). The apical /t/ and /c/ are fricativized into /l/ and /z/ respectively before
certain suffixes marked by subscript 1 (like |-1ki-|; P5i.a).","[153, 154, 155]"
"Morphological and syntactic characteristics1427cf. maa-nt-uq (IND.3sg.) he is here  voiceless nasal of the latter represents a merger of three phonemes:  > n + t + n.
Negative appositionals may occur in double negation (§ 44.1) together
with the general negative |-nћլit-| (§ 44). Compare with (17b):

(he) doing without fail
|pi-nћլit+pѠkѠ[-nani|
do-NEG-NEG-APP.3Rsg.iii) The negative mood marker |-1na-| is also found to occur in the future
and continuative prohibitional optatives (not to do, not to be ing) marked
respectively by |+1caqu(na)-| (§ 49.6.2) and |+1piiqѠ(na)-| (§ 49.6.3), thereby
showing some resemblance to negative appositionals. Comparison with Table
48 shows that 2sg. |-1naћ|, 1sg. |-1nii|, and OPT.2sg.3sg./APP.3sg. |-1naku| are
shared by both optative and appositional moods (see below).
1.4. Morpho-syntactic idiosyncracies
The monopersonal marking of an appositional verb (§ 51-ii.c, § 51.1.1)  i.e.
indexing of only one argument (even if the verb is syntactically transitive),
namely S or P  is directly responsible for those morphosyntactic idiosyncracies
not shared by any of the five other moods that have bipersonal markings on
transitive verbs (P and A). The A argument for transitive appositional verbs is
not marked, but it is coreferential with the subject of the main clause (either
intransitive S or transitive A).
There are cases where a coreferential marker is employed (§ 51.1.4.3), a
topic treated subsequent to the following idiosyncracy, which is connected with
the monopersonal marking and concerns the different persons (§ 51.1.4.1 and
§ 51.1.4.2).
This monopersonal marking has the effect that the S or P argument (or the
absolutive-case NP if explicit) is focused by the cosubordinate clause with an
appositional-mood verb.
1.4.1. First- and second person
The one argument marked in these two persons can either be S or P, as opposed
to the third and the reflexive third person (§ 51.1.4.2):
i) first person argument  marked, e.g. by 1sg. |+lua| or 1du. |+lunuћ| below for S and P functions. The intransitive subject S and the unmarked A are

than a dozen, of which a few seem to be originally composite.
Two of them |=wa| (§ 54.1) and |=kin(a)| (§ 54.2) may behave as nonenclitic particles also, that is, | wa| and | kin(a)| (for some speakers/dialects).
Clearly distinct from derivational or inflectional suffixes, they may attach to
words of any category (following the word, that is, to its right), whether inflecting (nouns or verbs) or non-inflecting.
While one enclitic |=Ѥu| and (§ 54.5) is syntactic, i.e. coordinatingconjunctional, all the others are taken basically as interactive adverbs and play a
greater role especially in conversations and narratives, containing some element
of modality. There are no pronominal enclitics in CAY (although all the personal pronouns may occur in bound phrases).
Except for the coordinating conjunctional |=Ѥu|, they are second-position enclitics, being attached to the first word of a sentence.
Enclitics may occur in succession, but three in succession (58)
=llu=ggur=am is rather rare and four in § 52(4) =kiq=ggur=am=llu may perhaps be the maximum.
The classification of enclitics below is again a tentative one. The first three
groups are very common in (particularly interactive) discourses and narratives,
but not so much in descriptive or explanatory speech and writings.
1. Reactive
Includes reactive, urging, question, expressive, etc.:
i) |=wa| ~ | wa|
ii) |=mi|
iii) |=am| ~ |am=|.",[1596]
"Final /t/ in (c), preceded by /i/ (except for one suffix |-at-|), is restricted to negative VVn suffixes (§ 44), and a fair number of stems with final /(ci)c/ occur in
adjectival stems. The group (c) has the peculiarity of selecting the negative
apposition marker (characterized by |-1na-|; § 51.1.3-i).
However, a good number of stems that are part of the basic lexicon are ambivalent, possibly functioning either as nominal or verbal:108 Morphological preliminaries
(14)Ambivalent: |atkuћ-|N/V parka; to put on a parka, |qanћլ-|N/V mouth;
to speak; more in § 10.4.","[159, 160]"
"(Dis)honorific (or attitudinal) expressions189In particular, they are (expected to be) mindful of avoiding too much focus on
themselves and of sounding self-assertive or authoritative in relation to other
peoples. It is most likely that speech, heedless of these subtleties, can sound
(too) abrupt, blunt, awkward, impolite, rude, or even childish.
Each of the devices listed above is illustrated in respective sections.
2. (Dis)honorific (or attitudinal) expressions
Certain NNh/VVh suffixes (§ 20.3) are selected to express the speakers attitude
toward or evaluation of the topic  person(s) or being(s) especially from within
the natural world  to be uttered. Distinctions are basically made among positive or honorific (elevating, respectful, desirable, or endearing), negative or dishonorific (depreciating, derogatory, or condescending).
(Dis)honorific or attitudinal expressions by means of the suffixes are very
common in daily utterances and in narratives, but less in formal speech such as
ceremonial or public speaking. Usually these suffixes (except NNh |-ћլuћլluћլ-|
poor, sorry) may not be used to refer to elderly persons, however.
In addition, Yupik speakers love to use cooing words  called |inqut-| ~
|inqutaћլ-| (from |inѠqѠ-| to coo (to child)) and VNrl/nm |+1ut-| or its derivative
|+1utaћլ-| means)  in addressing to a baby or a young child, whether a relative
or not. As a child grows up, their use may fall off (at least at the presence of
other people, when it is possibly embarrassing).
3. Word taboos
Some Yupik people claim to have had a kind of awareness of the tremendous
potency of words to actualize what they utter, perhaps on a par with the belief in
soul of language as has been reported from different corners of the world,
even though the topic would remain very difficult to adequately substantiate. 1
Word taboos, or the avoidance of words that are believed to be of ill omen or
otherwise improper, seem to have obtained in the traditional Yupik culture and
language.","[240, 241]"

1. General characteristics
Words, as the minimal content forms, are articulated upon or constructed of
the morphemes (§ 2.2.1), and the way they are constructed is the main concern
of morphology  in contrast with syntax which deals with larger units constructed of two or more words. Bound phrases (§ 2.3) belong to the interface
between morphology and syntax, thereby leaving their demarcation more ambiguous.
As a polysynthetic language (§ 2.1-i), CAY achieves through its morphology
what many other languages do through syntactic operations on phrases and
clauses. Grammatical relations (e.g. case, person), verbal categories (e.g. tenseaspect, modality, negation), valency modifications, (clausal) transcategorial
operations (nominalization and verbalization) as well as many semantic modifications (nominal and verbal) are taken care of by suffixes  derivational as well
as inflectional. CAYs causative verbs, for instance, are only morphological and
never analytical (Comrie 1985b: 331332)  see § 34.5 and § 39.1. The language has no causative verb stem meaning to cause, make. Hence the remarkable importance of CAYs internal syntax (Swadesh 1939), which has a
greater functional load than with many other languages and much overlapping
between morphology and syntax.
As such, CAY has a remarkably productive morphology, which constitutes
the most complex part of its grammar. It has a strong tendency to elaborately
pack a large amount of content (grammatical and semantic) into a single word 
mostly a verb but also a nominal  as the minimal form of articulation (i.e.
articulus; § 2.1) at the content level.
CAY may chiefly be characterized, in view of its morphology, as a language
that is:
i) almost exclusively suffixal in terms of the morphological process of word
construction; § 4.1.1 (predominant suffixation)
ii) highly agglutinative in view of its mechanical cohesiveness and one-toone correspondence; § 4.1.2 (agglutination)
iii) polysynthetic in terms of its dynamic or non-templatic morphological
productivity, which by necessity involves a rich internal syntax that packs rich
content into a single word; § 4.1.3 (non-templatic polysynthesis)
iv) notable for morphological ergativity, albeit with splits; § 4.1.4.1
v) notable for double-marking; § 4.1.4.2
Other minor characteristics will be mentioned in relevant chapters.","[135, 136]"

CAY non-inflecting words  which, unlike nominals and verbs, do not inflect 
are either particles or enclitics. Many of them generally are expressive or introduce the modification of a discourse function, with the exception of conjunctives. Some are illocutionary and others may be more or less expletive, serving
as lubricants in utterances. However, many non-inflecting words are so subtle
and elusive as to defy clear-cut definition. Their functional classification cannot
be a neat one, and the one made below (§ 52.3) is nothing but tentative.
Particles are polysyllabic, while enclitics are monosyllabic like |=lu|, |=kiћլ|,
|=ћuћլ|, and |=wa|. An enclitic is dependently attached to a preceding word,
forming an enclitic bound phrase, while a particle occurs independently, i.e.
with potential pause, or dependently, i.e. forming a non-enclitic bound phrase
characterized by a pre-boundary regressive accent  see i) below.
There are a few monosyllabic words that some speakers (or speakers in some
areas) may use as non-enclitics, that is, with a pre-boundary regression: |=wa| ~
_  wa| and |=kin| ~ _  kin(a)| (§ 54.1-i, § 54.2-ii).
The bisyllabic particle |qaa| may stand independely by itself meaning is that
right?, but is used typically as the marker for polar questions when it is attached to the sentence-initial word like _ qaa| (§ 53.2). It seems like a secondword enclitic, but forms a non-enclitic bound word and triggers a pre-boundary
regressive accent, unlike an enclitic (§ 8.4.1). Distinct from |qaa|, there are two
interjective particlizing suffixes VPc |+1paa| and |+naa| (§ 52.4).
The language has no proclitic per se: The proclitic-like |am=| (urging) as in
DP¶  QHUL hurry up, and eat! is a truncation and can also be enclitic-like
|=am| (§ 54.1-iii).",[1553]
"In the practical orthography the question marker |qaa| is generally written
with a hyphen, as it has commonly been considered an enclitic. It in fact behaves like an enclitic in being dependently attached to its head word at the beginning of a sentence. Prosodically speaking, however, it is more of a nonenclitic particle than an enclitic. Its prosody or accentuation pattern does not
show an enclitic bound phrase but a non-enclitic bound phrase and can occur
independently by itself (is it so/right?)  cf. § 43 and § 53.3㸬 In this grammar
the unequal sign (), instead of the equal sign, is employed to indicate the dependently used particle:
(181)Aana-qaa / $DQDTDD
cf. aana-mi / aana=mi/aánà(q)  TDD/ (is it, do you mean) mother?
/aána=mi/
how about mother? =
(178) above
 Note the regressive accent with gemination on /q/ by (P18iv.a  but
not P18ii) before TDD but its absence before =mi in the compared.ii) to distinguish a non-native stem. There are a considerable number of
words incorporated into (and established as part of) Yupik lexical stock from
Russian and some neighboring native languages such as Inupiaq, Aleut, and the
Athabaskan languages. English has also contributed loanwords, but far fewer
than Russian.",[132]
"174 Syntactical preliminaries
A third-person optative verb is mainly used for asking permission or consent
from the addressee (instead of a command  ii.a). It can also be used to avoid
the directness as a disguised person (§ 32.3.2) for a second person.
There are a few other devices to avoid the directness, e.g. use of the suffix
|-qaћլ-| (§ 49.4.3).
A prohibition or negative command is expressed by an optative-mood verb
expanded with the general negator VVn |-nћլit-| (§ 44, § 49.6.1).
ii) Indirect  various constructions may serve as indirect commands:
a. a third-person subject optative verb (let him)  § 49.2
b. the directive complex transitive verb with |+sqѠ-| A to tell / ask him
to  § 40.2.2
c. use of the modal suffix VVm |+naћլqѠ-| (§ 43) in an indicative-mood
verb (you should).
3.3. Exclamations and vocatives
i) Exclamation sentences  two types, involving the use of either:
a. two intensifying suffixes VVa |+1pakaћլ-| so much and |+1paћ-|
intensely (§ 41.3.2)
b. their apparently related particlizer VPc |+1paa| (§ 52.4.1)
 each occurring in a distinct construction, though substantially
equivalent as exclamations.
(a) |+1paћ-| and its apparently related particlizer (b) |+1paa| are first illustrated:
(56) a. Tupag-yara-tu-vag-cit

wake-early-REG-ITS-INT.2sg. 2sg.
b. Tupag-yara-tu-vaa
elpe-ni!
wake-early-REG-EXC
2sg.-LOC
What an early riser you (sg.) are!
(a) occurs with an interrogative-mood verb but without an interrogative word,
unlike content questions  § 5.3.1-i. It is a question-like exclamation. (In nonexclamative contexts, the suffixes can occur in any verb mood  see § 46
through § 51). On the other hand, (b) is a unique morpheme which derives verb
stems into non-inflecting words taking no (core) arguments, i.e. argument-less
(see § 27.6). Furthermore (a) involves an argument, i.e. in S function, as the
target of an exclamation and may be expressed externally by an NP in theSentence types 175absolutive case, while (b) may have the notional subject expressed in the locative case (§ 27.6).
The other suffix |+1pakaћլ-| in (a) above is shown with the interrogative inflection:
(57)Ner-yui-pakar-cit!
(elpet)
eat-never-ITS-INT.2sg.
2sg.
Why havent you (sg.) eaten all this time!See § 48.4 for a discussion of suffixal exclamations as in (56a), (57) and
§ 41.3.2 for the intensifying suffixes themselves, while § 52.4.1 for details of
the particlizer exclamation as in (56b).
ii) Vocatives: Forms used in addressing persons are chiefly characterized by
doubling of the final vowel of the absolutive form of nominals, except that a
singular vocative for nominal demonstratives ends in -suuq ~ -yuuq (§ 12.2.1
and § 31.1). Vocative demonstratives are more or less formal. Two other minor
types, as well as one with a locative-case NP referring to a first or a second
person argument, are provided in § 31.2 and § 31.3.
(58) a. u-suuqyou (sg.), this one here!
 cf. u-na (ABS.sg.) this one here
u-ku-u-t
you (pl.), these ones here!
 see § 12.2.1 for plural expander -ku-.
b. aana-a / [HBC] aana-ang
mother!
c. aana-maa
you (sg.), my mother!In addition, a locative-case NP referring to the second person, typically
placed in the sentence-initial position, has a vocative force if used with an optative-mood verb; cf. § 27.5.
3.4. Predicate-less sentences
In addition to typical sentences with a predicate verb (with or without its external core argument[s]), particles or NPs can be sentences by themselves. The
former includes sentence words (§ 53.2) and interjective/exclamative particles
(§ 53.1) as well as non-argumental exclamations/vocatives above (§ 5.3.3).

"Word and its constructions121Denominal verb derivation may share certain characteristics with noun incorporation (e.g. some extent of lexicalization, nominal elements as non-core
arguments, etc.), though CAY denominal verbs are not viewed as incorporation
in this grammar.
The denominal verbs derived with NV suffixes are monovalent (with S argument  [51]) or bivalent (with P and A arguments  [52]), the more common
of which include:
(51) a. to be/become   (stative/inchoative relational verb)
b. to be at (locative verb), to be far in direction, to go to
to have,to have plenty of, to catch a lot of; to lack/have no, to
deprive of, to de-, to make, to supply (with), to have a good, to
be a bad/unpleasant, to eat, to hunt, to go and get, to be affected/hurt in [body part], etc.
(52) a. to be/become someones  / to (now) have  as (stative and inchoative relational verbs), cf. (51a) above
b. to make/build for, to supply  with.
The (a) and (b) group are described in separate chapters § 37 and § 38. The
former, i.e. relational verbs (a), are very productive in many ways, both synchronically and diachronically, and will turn out to be the warp and weft of the
grammatical texture unique to CAY. Later chapters will clarify how important a
part relational verbs play in CAY grammar.
iv) Verb-elaborating suffixes (VV; § 39, § 40; § 41 through § 45)  modify a
preceding verb stem to form a verbally expanded stem, without converting the
word class. They are functionally most versatile and make up two groups in
terms of valency modification.
One group is responsible for valency modification  increase, decrease, and
rearrangement of arguments  within simplex verbs (VVsm; § 39  e.g. causative, applicative, adversative, etc.) and for producing complex transitive
(VVcm; § 40  directive, speculative, causative, ignorative, etc.), which embeds
a simplex verb into a (possibly recursive) upper-layered clause with its own
agent argument (A') added.
The other group involves no valency modification, but only concerns verbal
categories (VV; TAM, polarity, evidenciality, etc.), adverbial modifiers (of
manner, degree, location, time, etc.), and same-subject secondary verbs (e.g. to
wish to, pretend to, be tired of ing, etc.).
Besides these major types, there are a few specific types of suffixes:
v) (Dis)honorific suffixes  include a fair number of NNh/VVh suffixes that
express an attitude/evaluation (e.g. affectionate, pejorative) of the speaker to-122 Morphological preliminaries
wards the person(s) or thing(s) concerned as the subject argument (S/A). One
and the same suffix works either NN or VV, but is conveniently illustrated in
§ 20.2 as NNh. Some suffixes of this type in particular have the peculiarity that
they are typically nomadic, floating among nominals or verbs, and others may
stand after particles or (inflected) personal pronouns and particles, reminding us
of postinflectional derivation (§ 4.1.3.2). 17
vi) Particle related suffixes  there are a small number of suffixes  cf.
§ 5.1.3.2  that may:
(53) a. be added to particles  relational verb NVrv |+ƾu-| to be N, linker
EX |+(V/VV)ћլ-| to utter/say, VVa |+1paћ-| to say loudly, possibly
after particles as in § 41.3.2(111)
b. be added to ignorative words and particles  intensifying VVa
|-qapic-| ~ |-qapia(ћլa)ћլ-| (§ 41.3.1)
c. particlize verb stems  exclamative VPc |+1paa| (§ 52.4.1)
2.5.2. Suffix order
The considerable flexibility of word order within a sentence contrasts with the
relatively rigid suffix order within a word, which is, in general, determined semantically, grammatically, and/or pragmatically. A suffix may have semantic
and/or syntactic scope over the immediately preceding suffix or an expanded
stem as a whole. Due to semantic or grammatical constraints, two suffixes may
occur in opposite positions, generally with some difference.
Variously contrastive orders may be illustrated with two or three VV suffixes, each with different scopes, one of which is the reportative complex transitive
VVcm |+ni-| A' to say (§ 40.2.4):
(54) a. pissur-ciq-ni-a
hunt-FUT-A'.say-IND.3sg.3sg.
b. pissur-ni-ciq-aa
hunt-A'.say-FUT-IND.3sg.3sg.she said he would go hunting
she will say he has gone hunting17. The floating of attitudinal or evaluative suffixes is attested among some neighboring languages, like Koryaks argument-modifying type of diminutive/augmentative suffixes, which contrastively show the ergative pattern of S/P (M. Kurebito
2000). She remarks, in regard to the argument being referenced, that the Aleut suffixes (based on Bergsland 1997) behave neutrally in both between those of
Koryak/Chukchi and of Central Alaskan Yupik Eskimo (154).","[172, 173, 174]"
"A nominal clause with |+(u)ciћլkaћլ-| may be verbalized by NV |-li-| (to
make), hence VVt |+(u)ciћլki-| to make it a rule to (§ 42.5), which is a rather
rare case in which a nominalization is reverbalized by other suffixes than the
negative and the relational verbs, as stated in § 18.1:
(111)kuingir-ngail-ucirk-i-llru-anga
smoke-will.not-VNnm-make-PST-IND.3sg.1sg.
she made it a rule that I should not smoke / she instructed me not to
smoke
cf. kuingir-ngait-ua
I will not smoke
smoke-will.not-IND.1sg.",[646]
"VVcm |+(u)ciit-| not to know, to be unsure. This is clearly a composite of
the nominalizer VNnm |+(u)ciћլ-| (§ 18.2.1) followed by the privative NV
|ƾLW-|, which serves as an ignorative complex transitive suffix, as is amply illustrated in § 40.2.5. It is a morphologization of |naѤu-| not to know, be uncertain with the nominal clause.

1. Double and partial negation
i) Double negation  often attested where two negators occur within a single

variant |+1pѠkѠ-|. This is not a construction that involves two simultaneous
morphemes, one preceding the verb or verb stem, the other following as in
French ne  pas (Dryer 2008), but a verb in which one negation is cycled
back to a positive (emphatic) affirmation or some semantic modification:

The most important morphological characteristic of CAY appositional verbs is
that their inflection has the suppletive mood marker |+lu-| 2 ~ |-1na-| (called
negative appositional, § 51.1.3) followed by a single person, i.e. monopersonal, marker (just below).
The monopersonality here means that, even when it is semanticosyntactically transitive, an appositional verb marks only one person, as opposed
to a transitive verb in any other mood, which marks a bipersonal relationship
(such as IND.3pl.1sg. |(+ћaћլ)ƾDWƾD| they  me). More details in § 51.1.4.
Verbal person markers (Table 30; § 32.2.1) are employed to mark the single
person for appositional verbs. Table 50, above, gives the complete paradigm of
appositional inflections. This can be compared with the inflectional paradigms
for the other five moods (Tables 46 through 49), which are bipersonal for transitives.
While the two 1sg. appositional markers (|+lua| and |-1nii|) are formed by
regular phonological adjustments, the only morphological idiosyncracy is the
negative 2sg. |-1naћ| instead of *|-1natѠn|.

"Sentence types 1673. Sentence types
This is the only part where sentence types will be mentioned as a whole and
illustrated in details.
3.1. Questions  content, polar, alternative, echo, indefinite, indirect
There are two major types of interrogative sentences: (a) content or informational questions (as with a wh- word) and (b) polar (yes-no) questions, each
with subtypes. Both typically have a sentence-final falling tone.
i) Content questions: A content question is a request for information that the
speaker expects can or will be supplied by the addressee. It requires an
ignorative word or phrase (nominal or verb; see § 15.2 for six ignorative primary stems  what, who, where, when, how, how many) and a predicate verb
occurs in the interrogative mood (§ 48.2), as opposed to a polar question in ii)
below.
The ignorative word or phrase typically comes at the beginning of a sentence, though it can occur later in the sentence as well.
One question may contain two ignorative words conjoined by the enclitic
|=Ѥu| and as in (49) and (50).
The verb used in a response (a, b) in the following question (32) is not necessarily in the indicative mood as in (a) but is more frequently in the participial
as in (b), which is more reactive or responsive and is typically accompanied by
the reactive enclitic |=wa| (§ 54.1):

"The Yukon version of the most common greeting-like expression is cangac-it?
(what.amiss-INT.2sg.). It may carry negative connotations (something is
wrong with you?), and some elders do not seem to like this. There is another
expression waqaa, which is not a simple greeting either (see § 53.2).
2.5.2. |qayu-| how
At least in HBC and NS area, the stem occurs in a few fossilized particles, taking the place of |qaiѤ(un)| or |qavciћլ-| (below) (cf. Jacobson 1988: 58, 166):
(58)Qayu-tun (/ qavci-tun / qaill)
how-EQL
How much is it?aki-tu-ta-a?
value-endowed-as.as-INT.3sg.",[507]
"Some speakers differentiate by inserting (or retaining) the schwa in the second
(b). The negative (a) is ambiguous as it is homonymy with a separate verb stem
|Dƾћլ-| to say yes, i.e. ange-nrit-uq he did not say yes.
The scope of negation (i.e., that portion of a sentence affected) by the suffix
in the two sentences below is different as indicated by the italics in translations:
The adverbial adjunct (with a connective-mood verb) is outside the scope of
negation in reading (a), but falls within the scope in reading (b).

"This amount of derivation and conversion may not be particularly complex.
Characteristically in CAY, however, it is not only the case that deverbal nouns
(such as school and school-builder) can be verbalized (as in to build a
school or to be a school-builder), but that a nominalization  a nominal clause
and a relative clause  can be further reverbalized (e.g. I do not know that/if
he is a school-builder, etc.) and this, in turn, can even be renominalized (e.g.
my not knowing that/if he is a school-builder, etc.). This could certainly be
seen as a hallmark of Eskimo-type (non-templatic type) polysynthesis, and as
the source of the rich and subtle expressiveness in CAY. Undoubtedly it is due
to the productive, cumulative, and recursive (though rather restricted) uses of
these multifarious suffixes that CAY has attained its perhaps unsurpassed degree of polysynthesis among the languages of the world. More examples are
given particularly in § 17 and § 18 as well as in § 4.2.5.4.1 below.
Transcategorial expansion is very productive, like syntactic expansion, but
not only synchronically. Diachronically, it also has been responsible for a fairWord and its constructions119number of (fixed) grammatical markers (including verbal tense-aspect, negation
markers, indices of comparison, etc.)  see also cyclical expansion in
§ 4.2.5.3 below as well as § 20.4 (nominal) and § 37.5.3.2 (verbal).
Productive vs. obsolete suffixes: The majority of derivational suffixes (listed
in this grammar; see Suffix list, pp. 15651575) are productive enough in derivation to combine with most (or virtually any) semantically compatible stems.
Their productivity varies, however. At the other end of the scale there are suffixes which, having restrictions on their productivity, can combine only with a
limited number of stems (even if they are semantically compatible with other
stems), with some of them being almost obsolete (or even fossilized with
stems). As such, some derived words have acquired, to varying degrees, an
established special meaning, being semantically frozen or lexicalized, while
others are responsible for words that are made up anew on each occasion (like
phrases or sentences in more analytical languages).
Derived (expanded) stems that are lexicalized or (more or less)
grammaticalized may not be perceived as secondary derivatives, particularly
when phonological syncopation is involved, like weather impersonal monovalent stems (§ 33.3) and two pseudo-passive markers (§ 34.1.2.2).
Some suffixes are closely related to a particular semantic category, for instance, VN |-1quћլ-| (§ 19.2), which, though now obsolete, has left the noteworthy abundance of body-part and part-to-whole relation terms.
The unlimitedness of suffix accumulation is, however, merely theoretical. In
the case of Central Siberian Yupik (CSY), de Reuse (1994) remarked that, in
natural speech, the number of suffixes that occur in a word rarely exceeds half
a dozen. Though no statistical data is available for CAY in any category of
utterance, this tendency may not be remarkably different between the two languages.
It seems at least the case, nevertheless, that elder speakers in general tend to
have greater competence of producing highly synthetic words than do younger
speakers. It is to be mentioned that, in actual utterances, polysynthetic words
may carry modesty with the utterance on the part of the speaker. See § 41.3.1-v.
The more common and relatively productive suffixes of each type of derivational suffix are given in the relevant sections, but the list is far from exhaustive
 see Jacobson (1984a, i.e. YED) for fuller coverage.
Some examples of each type are given here to provide some idea with minimal illustration  see each referred chapter for glossed analyses:

§ 47.2.3), which typically occur immediately after a sentence-initial word, forming an enclitic or non-enclitic bound phrase. A few other particles may occur at
the initial-position of a sentence (§ 47.2.4).
2.1. |=wa| (~ | wa|)
This reactive (REA) particle is perhaps the most frequently used particles selected by participial verbs. See § 54.1-i and (P18iv.a) for pre-boundary regressive accents before the latter (dialectal) variant.
(10)intransitive:
Qaya-li-lria-nga=wa.
(Yes,) Im making a kayak.
kayak-make-PTP-1sg.=REA
 used more often in contrast with the indicative verb, indicating a
mere statement irrespective of the addressee:
cf. qaya-li-unga
Im making a kayak
kayak-make-IND.1sg.",[1383]
