"Discourse particles marking stance317In (10.22), the place name introduces new (i.e., previously unmentioned) information, and, therefore, functions like a polar question. But yu yu can be used
to confirm information that is not new. For example, in (10.23), which is from a
conversation, KS asserts that some children they are watching are off to fly kites.
DG responds with the newsmaker-type response token ngarrikuna (§10.2.1 above),
which functions here to seek confirmation of this assertion from KS. KS confirms
this with yu yu.

‘Really?’The negative marker miku is also used to negate whole propositions and to negate
or contradict as a single word (§9.5.1 for general negation). Overall, the responseparticle uses of miku constitute a small fraction of its overall use as a marker of
negation. In (10.24), it is a negative response to a polar question (marked with
rising intonation but no questioning morphosyntax). In (10.25), it is used as a
disconfirming response to a confirmation check.

The particle yuku ‘all right’ is used in a range of contexts concerned with positive
assessment, especially wellbeing. In (10.26), for example, DG uses yuku to question the health of KS who is having a coughing fit.

This was originally translated by the speaker as ‘We were happy (to have clean
clothes)’.","[334, 335, 336]"

(22.3.00.1.DMcD)10.2.3 Yu/miku ‘affirmation and negation’
Affirmation and negation/contradiction are done using the particles yu ‘yes’ and
miku ‘neg’, respectively. As (10.22) illustrates, the affirmative marker yu is mostly
uttered with repetition (i.e., yu yu). It rarely occurs as an affirmative response to
most polar questions, but this could be a result of the lack of clear polar questions
overall in the corpus.¹¹⁰ Yu yu does frequently occur as a response to confirmation checks, which may be considered a type of polar question. For example, in
(10.22), which is from an extended narrative, KS reports that the story characters
were left “over there”. DG proffers a candidate place name for where the characters were left (Kabularrku), and this is affirmed by KS with yu yu.

"9.4.1 Grammatically determined non-canonical orders
There are some forms that are obligatory in core-initial position: interrogative
words (§6.3), the negative particle miku (see §9.5.1), and the contrastive particle
ngala (§8.3.3). When these forms are used, they occur in the slot that verbs fill in
canonical word order sentences. TAM clitics and pronouns directly follow these
obligatorily initial elements. In such cases, the verb directly follows the core
(post-core position).

‘What were they making?’ (8.5.01.1.KS)91 I use the term non-canonical here to mean that the orders depart from the order of a declarative, positive polarity clause with no marked pragmatics. It does not necessarily mean that
such clauses are infrequent in discourse.",[290]
"9.5.1 Negation
Garrwa has many negative constructions formed using the negative particle
miku in initial position.⁹⁴ This particle is also used as the negative exclamative
‘no’ (e.g., in negative answers to polar questions). In clausal negation, the negative particle is followed by second-position clitic elements. This is typically a
pronoun, but some modal clitics are also possible, as discussed below. The verb
usually directly follows the second-position clitic complex. Where there are no
second-position clitics (e.g., when the referent is third person singular and therefore unmarked), the verb may directly follow the negative particle. Otherwise the
verb typically directly follows the second-position clitics.
In negative non-past contexts, verbs occur in the irrealis form (with -kanyi

speakers during transcription sessions.",[298]

The clitic =wali, here glossed as ‘evid’, is the only clearly epistemic modal morpheme in Garrwa. It is used in contexts where the speaker infers some future
event on the basis of (usually visual) sensory evidence in the present. As a consequence, =wali expresses that it is possible that something might happen on
the available evidence, but leaves open the possibility that it might not happen.
As there are only a few examples of =wali in the corpus, it is unclear how its
use relates to degrees of certainty. Speakers typically translate =wali-marked
clauses with ‘might’. In most cases, the actual evidence used is not made explicit,
although it can be, which (8.125) and (8.126) illustrate.

meaning ‘not able to do X’, which is clearly implied in its literal meaning ‘not

Furby and Furby (1977: 78) describe the morpheme kuna ‘question’ as a particle.
It occurs in second position, a position more associated with clitics than with
particles. It may be that this form is loosely cliticized to the initial constituent. It
always occurs before second-position pronouns when there are pronouns in the
clause. Kuna is used in some yes/no interrogatives to indicate that the utterance
is a question.

Unlike clitics, particles may occur as independent words and in a wider range
of positions than those morphemes defined as clitics. The particles described in
this section have a range of modifying functions. Particles associated with clause
combining are described in §8.3 below. Some particles associated with discourse
organisation are described in §10.2.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252]"

retained in the negative reading because the meaning relates to social obligations. For example, in (9.110) below, the speaker claims that the protagonists were
not obliged to bury the dead person (because of social convention). Instead, they
hung him up in a tree.

A negative existential predicate construction is formed using miku plus the
clitic =yaji as a nominal predicate. Speakers translate miku=yaji as ‘nothing’. Its
complement is a dative marked nominal or pronoun in such constructions. The
subject is typically unexpressed and interpreted as impersonal, which (9.114) and
(9.115) illustrate. Dative pronouns may indicate the person/number category of
the referent affected by the absence. This is illustrated in (9.115) and (9.116), where284Syntaxa negative possession interpretation is also possible. Most examples in the corpus
have a past time interpretation because they tend to occur in reminiscences of the
past. There is no overt tense marking in these examples.

‘There was no meat for us two down at the camp / We two had no meat

Yaji can also refer to general ‘things’ and places, which (9.119) and (9.120) illustrate. It seems plausible that the negation of such a general concept as a place/
thing could grammaticalize into a negative existential term as it appears to have
done here (i.e., no place = does not exist in space).

‘And you all keep watching my things.’ (3.9.04.4.DG)In some emphatic contexts, miku=yaji may occur with a the third person singular
nominal nyulu. This is common in clauses that start with the contrastive particle
ngala, which (9.121) illustrates. In these examples, miku=yaji is not in initial position because the sentence begins with the contrastive conjunction ngala, which
attracts a second-position pronoun. This ordering pattern relegates miku=yaji to
post-pronominal (post-core) position, which is the usual place for verbal predicates when they are not in canonical-initial position.
Note that the construction retains an impersonal reading even when there
is a third person singular pronoun, which examples (9.121) and (9.122) illustrate.

By far the most common use of question words in Garrwa is to ask questions.
It is common among Australian languages for interrogative forms to also have
indefinite, non-question related meanings (e.g., a form meaning who that can
also mean someone, I don’t know who) (Mushin 1995). It seems that, for Garrwa,
this indefinite reading is rare, certainly in main clauses. There are, however, some
examples from the corpus in which a question word appears embedded. It is
unclear whether the so-called embedded use of question words is associated with
an indefinite reading, or whether these are directly represented embedded questions and the question is simply shifted to the relative time of the main clause.⁹⁵
Example (9.128) illustrates this because the question follows a matrix clause of
direct speech (yanyba ngaki ‘she said to me’), and the deixis in the embedded
clause clearly shifts to the reported speaker (wanjawa nganyi mani ‘where is your
hand?’ rather than ‘where is my hand?’).","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"

"18Phonology(2.11)/badada/
/ngada/[ˈbɐɖʌˌɖɐ]
[ŋaɖɐ]‘baby’
‘mother’The presence of regularly retroflexed words suggests that a retroflex series has
been a distinctive part of Garrwa phonology that has possibly become less distinctive over time. There seems to be little evidence, therefore, to analyse a separate phonemic retroflex series for contemporary Garrwa. Such a series does exist
in the neighbouring language, Yanyuwa, and speakers seem to be aware of the
difference (among others) in the sound inventory. For example, the Yanyuwa
negative particle /kurdardi/ is commonly used in Garrwa (/miku/ is the standard Garrwa negative form), but regularly without retroflexion. When discussing
this form during an elicitation session, speakers debated whether the word could
be considered a Garrwa word or not. One speaker claimed that /kurdardi/ was
Yanyuwa but that /kudadi/ (i.e., without retroflex) was a true Garrwa word. This
reinforces the (re)analysis of Garrwa as being without a phonemic retroflex series.
As it appears that retroflexion is at best minimally contrastive in contemporary Garrwa, I do not use it in my orthographic transcriptions of the language,
even if consonants are phonetically retroflexed on a regular basis. I reserve retroflexion for phonetic transcription, where it occurs. There is too much variation to
be certain of which words may have been historically retroflexed, even if they no
longer exist. A more detailed phonetic study may reveal more systematicity than
has been possible here.","[35, 36]"
"9.3.1 The clausal core
The core of Garrwa sentences is the minimal obligatory component of a main
clause. The core component includes an initial position and a second position.
The initial constituent is canonically a verb, but can also be an interrogative or
negative or contrastive particle, or some pragmatically marked or prominent constituent (see below). This structural and language-specific definition thus differs
from the Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) characterization of a clausal core
as a predicate plus its arguments (e.g., Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 26). Many
Garrwa cores are in fact predicates plus their arguments, but they need not be.
For example, I have not included the position that immediately follows second
position as part of the Garrwa core, even though arguments frequently occupy
this position, and main verbs may also occur there (§9.4.2).",[282]
"This is the order given in speaker’s utterances in almost all elicitation contexts.
In declarative sentences of positive polarity, where there is no marked pragmatic
constituent (§9.4.2), the verb is the initial element of the core. In many other contexts, other elements may occur as the initial element of the core. In such cases,
the verb occurs in the immediate post-core position. I discuss these contexts
below as non-canonical word orders because they are associated with marked
pragmatic contexts.",[282]

The characteristic suffix -warr derives a noun from a verb that means ‘thing/
person that is characterized by [Verb]’. Some uses of verb-warr seem conventionalized as in ngarrkadaba-warr ‘spear-char’ for the health clinic (=place where
one gets injections) or kijijba-warr ‘tie.up-char’ for policeman, while others seem
productively constructed for a particular context. Verb+-warr constructions are
often found as modifiers of other nominals. For verb+warr constructions derived
from transitive verbs, the object of the transitive verb may be expressed with
dative case marking, which (7.179) and (7.180) illustrate.

There are a number of Garrwa words that function as modifiers rather than main
predicates and yet have surface forms that look like verbs, in particular the -mba
stem ending. These adverbs never occur as the sole predicate in clauses and
cannot take verb inflectional morphology. They do not occur clause initially in
unmarked contexts. In fact, they mostly occur either in their own intonation unit
or utterance finally. Meanings are quantificational or spatio-temporal, and often
aspectually modifying the main predicate.","[217, 218, 219, 220]"

‘“You’re going to get trousers – finished. (Then) you’re going to sit

physical wellbeing, although there may be indirect implications for wellbeing.

the right European name for a Garrwa place. ER and TD have been discussing
a recent trip they took together from Borroloola to Robinson River. ER asks the
original question before suggesting the Wearyan river. TD checks that this is not
Kalalakina, a different Garrwa place, before ER recognizes Bujiwunyi as a part
of the Folsche river (i.e., not the Wearyan), which is accompanied by yuku. This
assertion is immediately accepted by TD.

This particle/clitic is used in a range of ways, all of which indicate an intensification of that which is under its scope. Speakers frequently translate it as ‘more’,
although it does not seem to have the same range of meanings as the English
“more”. For events, it can mean that the event is done repeatedly. Mili is mostly
found in second position and so may be loosely cliticized to the preceding word
as other second-position phenomena are. In the second position, mili appears to
occur after all other possible clitics (TA and pronouns). In (10.30), it occurs after
the TAM clitic =(y)ili; in (10.31), it occurs after both the TA clitic and the following
accusative pronoun; in (10.32) and (10.33), it directly follows the pronoun.

emphasizes the fact that she can’t dance. Thus, she can’t participate in a ceremony that others might participate in.

(20.6.08.DG)In (10.37), which is from a conversation, the speaker is disputing a claim made
by another speaker on how people used to eat waterlily seeds. The use of mili
emphasizes the disagreement (translated here with ‘really’). Note that these three
conversational uses of mili in (10.36) and (10.37) illustrate mili in three different
places in the clause. In (10.36), mili immediately follows the pronoun and TAM
clitic. In (10.37), mili occurs (1) straight after the negative particle and before the322Discourse phenomenapronoun in second position, and (2) after the verb, which is in a post-core position.

This chapter focuses on word order, particles and their contribution to discourse
organization in Garrwa. Some features of turn management in conversation,
such as overlapping talk and the use of silence, are examined in other work (e.g.,
Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin and Gardner 2009; Mushin and Gardner 2010).
The range of particles examined here show much that is common across Australian languages and languages in general, but also much that may be unique to
Garrwa. For example, while the prior information particle barri shares features
with a related particle in Yanyuwa, they are clearly not synonymous. As noted in
the introduction to this chapter, any analysis of discourse phenomena is incomplete without a proper understanding of the use of prosody. Such as study must
be left for future work, however.","[336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"

"3.2.4 Particles and clitics
Garrwa particles are identified as forms that do not take any additional suffixes,
inflectional or otherwise. Forms of this type exhibit a range of grammatical functions that includes adverbial-like clausal modification (§8.2), location (§6.2.3),
clause combining (§8.3), negation (§9.5.1), and a range of functions associated
with discourse organization and talk-in-interaction (Chapter 10). Some particles
typically occur utterance initially (e.g., baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1)), some typically utterance finally (e.g., junu ‘perhaps’ (§8.2.5)), while others occur in second position
(e.g., kuna ‘question’ (§8.1.2.5)). Particles that occur in utterance-medial positions are usually weakly cliticized to the preceding word. I consistently represent
particles as independent words in this grammar in the interests of consistency.
Garrwa speakers treat them as independent words.
Garrwa clitics are always prosodically dependent on the preceding word, and
speakers do not typically treat them as independent words. Most clitics occur in
second position as part of the second-position clitic cluster within the core of the
Garrwa clause (§9.3.1). These include: tense and aspect markers (e.g., =yi ‘past’,
=yili ‘habitual’, =ngka ‘present’, and =ja= ‘future’ (§8.1.1)) and modal markers
(e.g., =kiyi ‘imperative (§8.1.2.1) and =wali ‘evidential’ (§8.1.2.4). Examples (3.16)
to (3.21) below illustrate these.

‘That snake might be alive.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)43As noted in §3.2.3.1 above, Garrwa pronouns are typically found as part of the
second-position clitic complex. As with particles, I consistently write them as
separate words, although it is clear that pronouns in the second position are
phonetically dependent on the preceding word in discourse. Modal clitics always
directly attach to the word in core-initial position. The examples above have tense
or aspect clitics attached to the second-position pronoun. However, as Mushin
(2008) and §8.1.1 of this book discuss, tense and aspect clitics can also directly
attach to the core-initial word and can precede the pronoun, which (3.22) illustrates with the past tense clitic =yi (=i when attached to pronouns).

Garrwa nouns are formally identified by morphological processes specifically
associated with this word class. Case marking is the most frequent and salient
morphology associated with nouns. Nouns form a large open class with many
subclasses (not all of which are themselves open-class categories). Noun subclasses are identified on the basis of their distribution, meaning, and case allomorphy. In this chapter, I describe the morphological and distributional properties of common and proper nouns, kin terms, and quantifying nouns. I describe
interrogative words, which mostly pattern with nouns, in Chapter 6.
Common nouns cover a large range of semantic types that includes words
referring to people, animate and inanimate natural objects, man-made objects,
and qualities of objects. Unlike many languages in this region, Garrwa has no
grammatical system of noun classification. There is also no verbal agreement or
obligatory pronominal cross-referencing. These are all common morphological
strategies among Australian languages for identifying referents and maintaining reference in discourse. In this context, Garrwa looks morphologically poor,
but Garrwa speakers have various strategies to establish and maintain reference,
such as choosing the referring expression (e.g., noun vs. pronoun vs. zero) and/
or the word order.","[60, 61, 62]"

"109positional and which may or may not constitute part of an auxiliary constituent.
The status of Garrwa pronouns compared with pronominal types in other Australian languages has been discussed in Mushin (2006) and Simpson and Mushin
(2008), and this section expands on the analysis developed in those papers.
Dixon (2002) analyses Garrwa as a language that lacks bound pronouns, but
which has, perhaps, some incipient signs of developing bound pronouns through
the compound pronoun forms. While the compound pronouns do indeed bind
pronouns to each other, this is not the same as bound pronouns as a category of
pronoun that must itself be attached to another word or constituent.
In a number of Australian languages, bound pronouns are transparently
derived from free forms (e.g., Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998)), which usually
includes a systematic reduction in form. In Garrwa, while there are some clear
contexts in which forms may be reduced, as a class, these reduced forms do not
appear to form a distinct paradigm on distributional grounds. This is evidence
against the analysis of Garrwa pronouns as having a free set and a bound set
(what Mushin and Simpson (2008) call “dual systems”), and I have maintained
the treatment of Garrwa pronouns as a single class. It is for this reason that I
have represented pronouns as independent words in all example sentences, even
when they prosodically and positionally seem to behave more like clitics than
independent words.
Almost all tokens of core argument pronouns in both elicited and text examples occur as the second element in what I call the clause’s core (see §9.3.1).³⁸
Second position is the default or unmarked position for Garrwa pronouns. When
they are in second position, pronouns are always non-stressed and may be analysed as cliticized to the preceding constituent.³⁹ Often, this preceding constituent is a verb (which (5.109) and (5.110) illustrates), but, as examples (5.111) and
(5.112) illustrate, when verbs do not occur in initial position, such as in interrogative and negative contexts, the pronoun remains in second position. This is evidence that the pronoun is attracted to second position rather than to the class of
verb.

The locative morpheme is used in a range of contexts associated with spatio-temporal location, position, and alienable possession. Some types of instruments are
also marked with locative case. The form of this morpheme is -na that follows
vowel-final nominal roots, and -ina that follows consonant-final nominal roots.
The allomorph -nyina follows demonstratives (including possessive pronouns)
and borrowed words from English. The allomorph -ndu (variant -nbu) follows pronouns. Examples (4.99) to (4.101) illustrate the use of these different allomorphs
(pronominal allomorphs are discussed further in §5.2).

tagNgarri also occurs as a response token: a single-word response with rising intonation (the same intonation contour as when ngarri occurs utterance finally). While
there are too few tokens in the corpus to formulate a detailed analysis, the translation of ngarri as ‘indeed’ or ‘really’, together with its positioning after new information (e.g., new episodes of a story), suggests that it can mark the recipiency
of new information (i.e., a newsmarker). The examples of ngarri in (10.12) came
while DG listened to a story being told by KS. DG responds to some new events
(but not all) in the story with ngarri. Following the second ngarri in this (edited)
extract, KS elaborates on the progression of the aboriginal prisoners’ journey and
validates this with an eyewitness – KS’s father. While, in general, it does not seem
that ngarri connotes a lack of belief (i.e., it does not mean something like ‘really,
I don’t believe it’), the fact that an evidential strategy is used immediately following the use of ngarri reinforces the analysis that ngarri is a newsmarker that
signals new information that must be integrated.

This particle has an epistemic modal meaning conveying a lack of certainty and
is, therefore, glossed with ‘perhaps’. Speakers frequently translate this as ‘don’t
know’,‘perhaps’, or ‘I think’. Unlike most other particles, junu is found at the end
of utterances or at least at the end of an intonation unit. Adjunct-like or nominal

is being said explicitly. For example, in (8.157) below, the speaker recounts the
things she used to do when she was young and living around the Barkly Tablelands. Here, the use of junu does not mean that she is not certain that they used to
muster cattle, but rather that mustering cattle was one among a number of things
they used to do.

ceremony near Alice Springs. She talks about seeing the campfires of all the
women’s groups who have already arrived, something she had directly experienced. The use of junu is not, then, about lack of certainty in this instance, but
rather about suggesting that there were lots of fires distributed around (and more
information besides).

(21.8.03.3.TD)8.3 Particles for clause combining
Various particles have a more specialized function that concerns the combining
of clauses.⁷⁷ The syntactic properties of co-ordination and related types of clause
combining in Garrwa are described in §9.3.2. In §8.3.1 to §8.3.5, I describe the morphological and semantic properties of each particle. Most clause-combining particles occur clause initially, except minji ‘conditional’, which occurs in second
position. They vary in the extent to which they attract TA clitics and second-position pronouns.","[254, 255, 256, 257]"
"10.1.2 The ‘prior information’ particle barri
The particle barri, here glossed as ‘pi’ or ‘prior information’, is a discourse-frequent form whose meaning is clearly associated with the organization of discourse rather than the propositional content of utterances.¹⁰⁶ Generally, barri has
scope over the information that precedes it (usually the word that precedes it),
and operates in conjunction with word order and prosody to signal the status
of information being expressed. While the precise pragmatic properties of barri
have yet to be completely solved, its principle function appears to be to link information under its scope with prior information. Such prior information may be
mentioned earlier in the same discourse, or may constitute shared information
with the interlocutor. Barri frequently occurs following the distal demonstrative
nanda, which supports its analysis as a type of anaphoric discourse marker. For106 Barri was originally analysed as a hesitation marker (e.g., like English um) in Furby and
Furby (1977) and Belfrage (1992), perhaps due to its seemingly flexible distribution within
clauses. However, it has no properties of true hesitation markers. Kirton and Charlie (1996)
analyse the similar Yanyuwa particle barra as a focus particle.",[321]
"9.6.1 Dependent (participial) clauses
By definition, dependent clauses in Garrwa are clauses that only occur as part of a
larger clausal unit. In most cases, the verb of a dependent clause takes one of the
five suffixes described in §7.5 (purposive, subsequential, same-subject simultaneous, different-subject simultaneous, and irrealis). These suffixes indicate the
semantic relationship between the propositions of the dependent clause and the
main clause, typically in terms of temporal and causal relationships. As noted in
§7.5, the irrealis morpheme -kanyi is historically related to the dative case marker
-(ka)nyi, the same-subject morpheme -jina is related to the locative case marker
-(i)na, and the different-subject morpheme -kurri is related to the allative case
marker -rri. The purposive (-ji), subsequential (-jiwa), and same-subject (-jina) are
all formed around the suffix -ji, the origin of which is unclear. The clear relationships between dependent clause morphemes and case markers suggests that
verbs in dependent clauses should be treated as participial – more noun-like and
less verb-like – complements of main clauses.⁹⁷
As complements of main clauses, the type of participial clause is shaped
by the type of the main clause: irrealis clauses are the complements of clauses
expressing speech and cognition, and are complements in negation; differentsubject simultaneous clauses are typically complements of verbs of perception;
same-subject simultaneous clauses typically occur with stance and motion verbs;
purposive clauses are typically complements of motion verbs; while subsequen-97 Furby and Furby (1977) call these “participial clauses”. See Austin (1981) for an earlier
description of similar clause types in a range of Australian languages, which includes Garrwa.",[306]

This form appears based on a demonstrative form, although it is difficult to determine whether it is fundamentally distal, proximal, or neither. I have glossed it asDemonstratives129‘like this’, although it frequently occurs in contexts that would translate better
into English as ‘like that’. Speakers use both ‘like this’ and ‘like that’ when translating nani. Speakers use this form in a wide range of contexts to describe an
activity or an action to demonstrate the kind of activity it is. It occurs frequently in
narrative and procedural texts where speakers are demonstrating activities that
are not being actually undertaken in the here and now. Nani can be accompanied
by gestures to demonstrate the action being pointed to, but it is not necessary
to accompany nani with associated demonstrating gestures. In a sentence, nani
usually precedes what it is demonstrating. For example, in (6.61), it precedes the
represented speech, while in (6.62) and (6.63), it precedes the clause or predicates
that represent the demonstrated action.

‘Talk to that one, the old woman – (talk) like this!’ (3.9.03.4.KS)6.2 Directionals
Garrwa has a closed set of root forms associated specifically with compass directions (i.e., north, south, east, and west) and with the vertical axis (i.e., up and
down). These are called directionals. Unlike nominals, pronouns, and demonstratives, directionals are never found as core arguments of verbs, and they do not
take nominative, accusative, ergative, or dative case forms.
Directionals can, however, occur with a range of morphological marking to
indicate location in X place, and motion towards or away from a deictic centre
with respect to absolute direction. The meanings of these morphemes coincide
with those for the nominal cases – locative, allative, and ablative – but their
forms are so different from the allomorphs of nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives that it is likely they have a substantially different origin. I use the case categories in glossing for consistency and due to directionals’ semantic similarities
with nominal case marking. Directionals additionally take suffixes associated
with more specific spatial arrangements, such as ‘facing’ or ‘to one side’. For this
reason, I consider directionals to constitute their own closed word class.
The four compass directions (§6.2.1) and the forms kingkarri ‘up’ and wayka
‘down’ (§6.2.2) constitute the set of absolute directions. In addition to these, relative direction may be expressed using a number of uninflected particles. These
are described in §6.2.3.","[145, 146, 147, 148]"

(Furby and Furby (1977) calls this an “obligation clause”). There are only a few
examples of this construction in the corpus. Note that this construction can be
found with or without a second person pronoun, which examples (8.112) and
(8.113) illustrate.

‘Throw the hat like this, old woman.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)8.1.2.2 =Kiya ‘obligation’
The obligation clitic =kiya is used in a range of contexts associated with speakers’ stance towards the content of an utterance. This includes content either a)
desired by the speaker but not accomplished by the addressee, or b) intended by
the speaker or referent but understood to be socially proscribed or undesirable.
Unlike the directive clitic =kiyi (described above), =kiya occurs with all person/
number categories and in past and non-past contexts. Unlike =kiyi, it implies
no illocutionary force through directing an addressee to carry out an action, but
rather focuses on the action in question as one that is bound by social relations.
I use the term obligation for this clitic because this term evokes social relationships and restrictions, explicit or implied. This is consistent with the clitic’s
deontic modal functions. Because there are a relatively small number of tokens
of this form in the corpus, it is difficult to develop a more detailed account of the
notion of obligation. As such, the nature of the obligation may not be explicit in
the data. It emerges most strongly in second person past-tense contexts where
the implication is that the addressee should have done something but did not.
Examples (8.115) and (8.116) illustrate this.

with =kiya by expressing a self-motivated action (i.e., the thing desired) that is
not able to be carried out. In (8.117), which is from a traditional narrative, the
speaking character expresses a desire to eat, a euphemism for having sex. The
person he desires is one who is not an appropriate sexual partner, however.⁷⁶

The four compass directionals and their inflected forms are predominantly used
to specify spatial relationships on the horizontal axis. The other two absolute
directional words, kingkarri ‘up’ and wayka ‘down’, specify relationships on the
vertical axis. Both kingkarri and wayka are used not only for true verticality (e.g.,
skywards and groundwards), but also for indicating direction towards and away
from lower land masses (e.g., wayka indicates ‘towards a riverbank’ and kingkarri
indicates ‘away from the river’ ). These forms are mostly used to express direction
with geographic terrain sloping up (e.g., away from watercourses and up hills) or
sloping down (towards or at a watercourse and down hills).

‘And they used to cook turtle bellyside (turned) up.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)There also seem to be conventional uses of wayka and kingkarri associated with
places. In (6.92), the speakers in Robinson River use wayka to refer to where Borroloola is located. This appears similar to the ways English speakers use up and
down to refer to places (e.g., down to Melbourne, up to Darwin, etc). In English,
there is typically an association with compass direction (north places are up and
south places are down). However, this may not be the case in Garrwa. In (6.92), for138Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogativesexample, it is unclear why Borroloola should be down from where the speakers
are located (at Robinson River).

includes a specific endpoint (i.e., to an up place / to a down place), these terms
may also take directional suffixes, such as the ablative -(li)nya (i.e., motion away
from a goal) and the allative -(li)ji⁴⁶ (i.e., motion towards a goal).

"6 Demonstratives, directionals,
and interrogatives
This chapter mostly describes forms whose primary function is to pick out entities
and locations in space: demonstrative, direction, and location words, words used
to ask information questions, and constructions associated with temporal reference. Many of the forms described in this chapter share some features with nouns
but differ enough in their inflectional possibilities and in their distribution in sentences for them to be classified as a different word class from nouns. Like nouns,
however, demonstratives form part of the system of reference, and can combine
with nouns in nominal groups (see §9.1). Therefore, they share inflectional features with nouns. Location and direction words generally function as adjuncts in
clauses to signal aspects of spatial orientation. Their inflectional properties are
restricted to grammatical meanings associated with spatial orientation, and they
pattern quite differently from nouns. Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogatives each form a small closed class based on their distinct morphosyntactic
behaviour. There are also a number of location words and temporal words that
pattern more like particles.","[131, 132]"

Both words are used to refer to ‘olden days’, typically pre-European contact days
or “wild times” (Roberts 2005) when people lived a more traditional life. Example
(6.156), however, illustrates wabula referring to several years ago – a time still in
the interlocutor’s more recent life. Wabula and wankala may also occur together,
especially in historical accounts, which (6.158) illustrates. Wankala is sometimes
used to refer to the people who lived in the olden times rather than the times
themselves, which (6.159) illustrates. Wabula may also refer to a past time that is
several years before the time of speaking but still in the speaker’s lifetime.

Garrwa verbs constitute a single class on the basis of their syntactic behaviour:
they canonically occur in main clause initial position and take class-specific
morphology associated with dependent clause formation. Garrwa verbs are also
somewhat unusual in the Australian context because they lack much inflectional
morphology. Inflectional categories normally associated with verbs in Australian
languages, such as tense, aspect, and mood marking, as well as person/number
marking, are largely absent (see Chapter 8 for tense/aspect marking). Most of the
verbal morphology is associated with the formation of complex clauses (§7.4).
Verbs minimally include a verb root. In most cases, in order to be used as a
word, verb roots must be augmented with stem-forming morphology. Some of this
is productive, but much of the stem-morphology is frozen and no longer productive.
Garrwa verbs maximally consist of a root, a stem-forming affix, and a wordforming affix. Simple verb stems do not require a stem-forming affix (i.e,. the root
and the stem are the same form), but complex verb stems require a stem-forming
affix. These vary from forms with no clear synchronic meaning (e.g., -j- and -n-) to
those that have clear meanings (e.g., -rri-j- ‘causative’). Verbs may consist of more
than one stem (e.g., /wijkunumba/ ‘bring back’ comprises wi-j+kunu-mba). Additional morphology associated with the formation of complex sentences attaches
to the stem. There are three conjugation classes, described below, which are classified on the basis of their distinctive patterns of stem formation.⁵¹
There is some degree of productivity in verb formation with many verbs transparently built from nominal, adverbial, and other verbal roots. Verb stem-forming
affixation enables the form to be used as a verb. Verbs that do not have transparent nominal or adverbial roots may have originated as coverbs, and I call these
true Garrwa verbs here.⁵² The patterns of stem-formation and the transparency
of the semantics of the verb stem differ depending on whether the verb root is a
basic verb (§7.1) or whether it is derived from another word class (§7.2).","[168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174]"

Ngala combines clauses in various contexts associated with contrast, disjunction, or relating events relative to each other in time. It is usually translated
as ‘but’ or ‘while’. Ngala is only used to combine clauses that occur utterance
initially, and is frequently separated from the previous clause by an intonation
break. Ngala can also occur turn initially to link a conversational turn with a previous turn. Clauses that start with ngala usually do not have TA marking and take
their overall temporal association from the first clause. This makes ngala-marked
clauses appear more like subordinate clauses, which also lack independent TA
marking. Unlike subordinate clauses, however, verbs in ngala-marked clauses are
in their unmarked form. Ngala is almost always directly followed by a pronoun
and/or modal clitics, which mark it as an initial constituent of the clausal core
(i.e., a word which attracts second-position phenomena), which (8.180) illustrates.","[260, 261, 262]"

"10 Discourse phenomena
This chapter focuses on forms and constructions that are used in discourse to
facilitate information packaging and intersubjectivity of discourse participants.
Information packaging concerns the ways in which speakers organize their turns
of talk to link them informationally to what has come before, or to foreshadow the
status of information in the talk to come. Some of the resources used by Garrwa
speakers to package information are described in §10.1. Section 10.2 focuses on
forms that indicate some aspect of stance-taking. Most of the forms in this section
are what traditional grammars have variously called interjections, particles, and
adverbials.¹⁰² Where possible, I try to ground the uses of all discourse phenomena in a rich contextual description of how forms are used in conversation.
A number of the Garrwa forms described here are also found in the neighbouring language Yanyuwa. These include ngarri, barri, (barra in Yanyuwa),
and mili (Kirton and Charlie 1996). Given Yanyuwa otherwise unrelatedness to
Garrwa, the sharing of so many discourse level features is a symptom of the close
contact between the language groups, which results, perhaps, in a conflation of
pragmatic conventions, discourse organisation, and rhetorical style.","[317, 318]"

‘What are we going to do?’ (4.5.01.1.TD)7.2.1.4 Class 1 verbs derived from substantive nouns
Verbs derived from nominals that denote physical or substantive objects have
less predictable meanings than those that denote qualities (§7.2.1.1). This may
because these verbs have been used in the language for a significant amount of
time, which has shifted them to have more specific meanings rather than a compositional ‘cause X’. Clearly, there are also class 1 verbs that have compositional
meanings of the kind ‘cause X to exist’, which the following examples illustrate.
(7.39)bijibiji ‘plaited hair’
buwarraji ‘dreaming’
jalyu ‘bed’
kaburr ‘initiate’bijibiji-mba ‘plait (hair, string, bark)’
buwarraji-mba ‘dream’
jalyu-mba ‘make bed’
kaburr-mba ‘initiate’Each verb in the next set has a less predictable meaning, although this meaning
clearly strongly associates with the meaning of the each verb’s nominal root.","[186, 187, 188]"
"2.5.1 Reduplication
Apart from suffixation, reduplication is the only other productive morphological process in Garrwa. It seems that all common nominal and verbal words have
the potential to be reduplicated. Verb reduplication is discussed in more detail
in §7.3.4. Here, I focus on reduplication of nominals and adverbials. The general
rule, regardless of word class, is that two-syllable roots totally reduplicate the
first syllable and three-syllable roots and higher reduplicate the second syllable
only. Sometimes, the final syllable is reduplicated in three-syllable roots (as with
bankulu ~ bankululu below).
Examples (2.38) and (2.39) illustrate some two-syllable roots.
(2.38)/burrku/
/larrwa/
/malbu/‘tail’
/burrkuburrkun/ ‘tail feather of emu (big tail)’
‘pipe’
/larrbalarrba/
‘pipe’ (alternative form)
‘old man’ /malbumalbu/
‘old men’As §2.1.4 above notes, some reduplicated two-syllable words show lenition in the
first consonant of the reduplicated form.
(2.39)/bala/
/kaburr/
/kamu/‘forked stick’
‘uninitiated boy’
‘later’/balawala/
/kaburrwaburr/
/kamuwamu/‘forked sticks’
‘uninitiated boys’
‘much later’Examples (2.40) to (2.43) illustrate some three-syllable and higher roots.
(2.40)/bankulu/
/bajangu/
/badibadi/‘stone axe’
‘dog’
‘old woman’/bankululu/
/bajajangu/
/badidibadi/‘stone axes’
‘dogs’
‘old women’Partial reduplication of dyadic kin terms is productively used to indicate more
than one member of the dyad is present in the group. For example:30Phonology(2.41)/bawakula/
/bawawakula/
/kawuju/
/kawuwuju/‘two brothers (of the same parents)’
‘a group of brothers’
‘woman and her brother’s daughter’
‘a group of three or more people in the
relationship of woman and her brother’s daughter’In most cases, reduplicated nominals indicate plurality, whereas reduplicated
adverbials are intensified. In all of the examples above, there is no change in
word class between the reduplicated and unreduplicated forms. However, there
are some examples of reduplicated nominals that appear to derive from unreduplicated verb roots. For example:
(2.42)/ngarra-j-ba/
/ngundurr-ba/‘be hot’
‘snore’/ngarrangarra/
/ngundurrngundurr/‘hot (one)’
‘windpipe’There are also many nouns that have the form of reduplications but which lack
unreduplicated counterparts, at least in contemporary Garrwa.
(2.43)/bududabududa/
/bunyulbunyul/
/kalirrkalirr/
/kijirrikijirri/
/mulyamulya/
/munjimunji/
/ridiridi/
/wakadawakada/‘swollen’
‘soft, rotten’
‘boney’
‘Willy Wagtail’
‘sack’
‘bush’
‘walking stick’
‘cattle’2.5.2 Loss of segments in connected speech
In connected speech, speakers commonly omit final-/i/ vowels, especially when
they follow a velar, a palatal nasal, or a palatal guide. This is especially common
in allomorphs of the dative case /-nyi/ for nouns and/-ngi/ for pronouns.
(2.44)/nanga-ngi/
/wawarra-nyi/
/jila=nyi/[ˈnaŋaŋɪ] ~ [ˈnaŋaŋ]
‘3sg-dat’
[ˈwawaˌraɲɪ] ~ [ˈwawaˌraɲ] ‘child-dat’
[jilaʲɲ]
‘walk=hort’English loanwords31There is a tendency for the first syllable to be omitted (i.e., the last syllable on
the first word) when syllables with at least the same onset (if not the same form
altogether) are adjacent.
(2.45)/wanya nyulu/[wanjʊlʊ]‘what’s that’2.6 English loanwords
Garrwa has borrowed many words from English, some perhaps indirectly through
Kriol. Regular phonological changes include the regular use of /j/ for English /s/
/z/, /sh/ (e.g., jimuku ‘smoke’, yujimba ‘use’, and jadanyi ‘shirt’), /b/ for /f/ and
/v/ (e.g., bilawa ‘flour’, babulun ‘buffalo’, and kabikabi ‘calf’), and the splitting
up of English consonant clusters with the vowel /i/ (e.g., jiwayiki ‘swag’ and
birijin ‘prison’).
Loan verbs inflect as Garrwa verbs and behave as class 1 stems (§7.1.1). This
seems to be a productive process because some of the forms in the corpus have
not even phonologically adapted to Garrwa (e.g., waystimba ‘waste’ and raydimba ‘ride’).

In this chapter, I describe some of Garrwa’s key typological features and briefly
overview the morphological and syntactic properties of the word classes in the
language.
Like many other Australian languages, Garrwa has two open classes of lexical
items (nouns and verbs), both of which have distinctive inflectional and syntactic
properties. Nouns are described in detail in Chapter 4, and verbs are described
in detail in Chapter 7. Closed word classes include pronouns (Chapter 5), demonstratives (Chapter 6), and directionals (Chapter 6). These closed classes also have
distinctive morphological and syntactic properties. There is a large, but probably
closed, class of forms that do not take inflectional morphology: I call these particles. These are mostly described in Chapters 8 and 10.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"
"268SyntaxExamples (9.47) to (9.49) illustrate pronouns occurring in positions other than
second position in the core. In each example, an initial and preverbal pronoun
expresses a referent in contrast with other referents. In (9.48), for example, the
speaker (in Borroloola) instructs the addressee (the linguist) to go east (to Robinson River) where Garrwa people will be able to talk to her about the Garrwa language. The speaker then claims to have forgotten much Garrwa in contrast with
the Robinson River people who have not. The utterance consists of three main
clauses: an imperative clause; a future+pronoun-initial clause, and a pronouninitial clause.⁸⁹

The order of core arguments (i.e., nominal forms that express A, S, and O roles)
depends entirely on a) whether the argument is expressed as a noun/nominal
group or as a pronoun, and b) the information status of the arguments in a given
clause. The effects of information status on this order are discussed in general
in §9.4 and §10.1. It is unusual for more than one argument to be expressed as
a noun or nominal group.⁹⁰ Pronominal arguments are almost always found in89 Further work is required to determine whether the initial ja= in sentences such as example
(9.48) should be analysed as core initial alone or together with the pronoun. For now, I analyse
the construction ja= + pronoun as constuting initial position together.
90 This is consistent with DuBois’ (1987) “preferred argument structure”.","[285, 286]"

My introduction to Garrwa began in 1999 when I embarked on the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) funded
“Garrwa Language Project” in conjunction with members of the Borroloola Language Centre. In the first phase of the project, I conducted fieldwork in Borroloola
in November 1999 and March-June 2000 to produce a 325-word picture dictionary and a non-technical grammatical sketch to facilitate the Garrwa language
program. These materials were published in house to be available for developing
teaching materials. A number of mostly narrative texts were also audio recorded
at this time and compiled as an in-house text collection.
I was able to continue working on Garrwa in 2001 through a University of
Sydney postdoctroral fellowship entitled “Language loss and the linguistics of
storytelling in Aboriginal Australia”. The focus of this project was on language
use in narrative discourse. I conducted field trips in May 2001 and August-October
2003 that concentrated on the recording and transcription of narrative and conversational data with elicitation of particular linguistic features a secondary goal.
Publications that emerged from this narrative-focused project include Mushin
(2005a), Mushin (2005b), Mushin (2006), Simpson & Mushin (2008), and Mushin
& Simpson (2008). More conversational data was collected and transcribed in
field trips in November 2006 and June 2008, which was supported by AIATSIS
“Garrwa Language Project, Phase 2” and a University of Queensland Staff grant.
In writing this grammar, I have tried to balance the interests of both Garrwa
people and linguists. Garrwa people may want to use this book as a resource for
how to say things in Garrwa or to provide tools for language maintenance and
revitalisazation in the future. They may also like to have a document that demonstrates the uniqueness of their language. Linguists may be interested in the
grammatical features of Garrwa for a range of theoretical issues.
My own interests have been in developing a description of the language as it
is used by its speakers. Consequently, the focus of this grammar is on the kinds of
utterances that speakers employ in actual discourse, and it takes advantage of the
considerable corpus of Garrwa discourse recorded between 1999 and 2010, which
is supplemented with field notes and recordings of other linguists and anthropologists who have worked on Garrwa. I focus less on structures that, though they
may be elicited under certain conditions, are seldom used. Where possible, I try
to link my description of the structural features of Garrwa to the ways in which
such structures are used in discourse, especially ordinary conversation.
While many Garrwa speakers have contributed to this project, I have been
fortunate to have had sustained language teaching, transcription, and translation assistance from †Doreen George, †Kathleen Shadforth, and Thelma Dixon.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"

Many Australian languages are described as having free word order in the sense
that their syntactic functions (e.g., subject and object) are not signalled by word
order as they are in English, and that there is no fixed orders in phrase-like units.
Garrwa is like other Australian languages in this regard. However, as this section264Syntaxshows, there are clear patterns of ordering – some are syntactic based and some
are pragmatically based.
A sentence can minimally include a verb plus a TAM clitic, but only when
there is an established third person subject referent (which (9.39) illustrates) or
in imperative contexts. For all other persons and numbers, a pronoun must also
be used (which (9.40) and (9.41) illustrate). The verb-TAM clitic-pronoun combination thus forms the core of a Garrwa sentence. Nominal groups that represent
the core arguments of predicates (verbs) are not grammatically obligatory and
frequently occur in intonation units following the core (see below). Adjuncts tend
to occur at the periphery of the sentence, usually finally, and often in a separate
intonation unit.
The canonical word order in simple sentences can be represented by the following template:
(conjunction) – (adjunct) – Core {comprising initial and second positions} – (core argument
nominal group) – (adjuncts).","[280, 281, 282]"
"1.5 Previous linguistic work on Garrwa
Although Garrwa (also spelled Garawa, Karrwa, Karawa) people have been in
contact with Europeans since the late 19th century, there appears to have been
little linguistic interest in the Garrwa language until the mid 20th century.
Garrwa people worked in and around the developing pastoral industry, but there
appears to have been little interest in documenting the language until the 1960s.
A linguistically distinct Garrwa people were identified by the beginning of the
20th century as part of anthropological surveys of the area (e.g., Basedow 1907;
Mathews 1899; Tindale 1940).
The first substantial elicitation of Garrwa language comes from Ken Hale’s
survey in 1960–1961. Hale’s data, recorded during the Brunette Downs races,
largely consists of words and simple sentences designed to produce grammatical paradigms such as pronouns and case markers. Elicitations and transcriptions of Garrwa language were also made by Velma Leeding in Borroloola and
Darwin in 1964, Charles Osborne in Doomadgee in 1966, Elywn Flint in 1968 in
Doomadgee as part of the Queensland Speech Survey, and Nils Holmer in Westmoreland (QLD) in 1979. Most of these involved elicitation of words, pronoun
paradigms, and simple sentence types. In many cases, it is unclear whether the
Garrwa people consulted were speakers of Western or Eastern Garrwa. Data collected in Doomadgee is more likely to be Eastern Garrwa than data collected in
and around Borroloola, but Osborne’s informant was born in Robinson River and
was clearly a Western Garrwa speaker.
The most substantial descriptive work on Western Garrwa in the 1960s was
carried out by Edward and Christine Furby, both Summer Institute of Linguistics
(SIL) linguists, during the period 1968–1970 in Borroloola. The Furbys compiled
an extensive corpus, including a 3000+ wordlist, texts, and a series of publications on aspects of Garrwa grammar (including Furby 1972; Furby 1976; Furby and
Furby 1977). Following the Furbys’ work, a number of SIL texts were produced
in Garrwa including children’s readers and a translation of parts of the the New
Testament. Further translation of Christian texts and songs into Garrwa is being
continued by Alan and Lucy Rogers who resided in Robinson River in the late
1980s, and who are now based in Darwin. Gavin Breen conducted fieldwork in
Doomadgee in the late 1980s and his comparative work on Garrwa and WaanyiA note on the referencing of examples11(originally produced in manuscript form in 1989) was published in 2003 in Evans’
collection of Non-Pama-Nyungan languages (a continuing reminder of the contended status of Garrwan languages). Breen’s work is the only published work
that focuses on the Eastern Garrwa variety.
In 1992, Hugh Belfrage produced an honours thesis on aspects of Garrwa pronominal and verbal morphology, and a revision of his analysis of verb morphology was also published in 2003 in Evans’ volume. While working for the Northern
Territory Department of Education, Belfrage also compiled a draft dictionary in
1997 using the Furbys’ corpus.⁵
Finally, the reader is directed to the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) catalogue for an up-to-date collection of
Garrwa language materials (published and unpublished) – www.mura.aiatsis.

resources used in the current work.","[28, 29]"
"‘Basic’ verbs1577.1 ‘Basic’ verbs
This section describes verbs that are derived from roots for which there are no
attested nominal or adverbial forms. Verbs of this kind constitute the vast majority
of frequently used Garrwa verbs and occur across the three conjugation classes.
As noted above, verb roots rarely occur as full words. Most verbal words are comprised of a root, a stem-forming affix, and, depending on conjugation class, a
word-forming -ba suffix. The citation form of verbs, which is also the form used
in simple sentences, is called the unmarked form. Other forms used in complex
sentences are called inflected forms.
There are three classes of verbs according to patterns of stem formation:
Class 1 (m-class), class 2 (j-class) and class 3 (n-class). Class 2 may be further subdivided into three subclasses (§7.1.2).","[174, 175]"
"Complex sentences295The clause-combining particles vary not only in the relationship between the
clauses they combine, but also in the grammatical properties of the combined
clause. The particular properties of each individual particle is described in §8.3
but summarized in the following table.
Clause-combining particles that do not attract second-position pronouns
(i.e., baki and mada), are clearly co-ordinating two independent clauses, each
with their own core, their own arguments, and their own tense/aspect/modal
marking (see §8.3 for more examples). The particles in these constructions must
be analysed as external to the clausal core.

combined clause. This makes the combined clause less like an independent
clause even though it has tense/aspect marking and may have a different subject
from the first clause in the sequence.

Unlike all of the clause combining particles examined thus far, minji can occur in
both initial position and immediately following initial position. It always directly
precedes a pronoun if pronouns are present in the clause. When it occurs in
second position, it looks like a modal particle; however, its meaning and occurrence in initial position suggest it should be considered a clause-combining particle like ngala and baki. Clauses beginning with minji usually have their own TA
marking.
Minji is described here as ‘conditional’ in the sense that a clause marked with
minji signals condition(s) under which some situation denoted in the following
clause obtains – a realis conditional. It can be used in both past and future contexts and can usually be translated as something like: ‘When X is the case, Y is
(or will be) the case’. Like baki and jala, the TA marker =yili can attach directly to
minji (resulting in the form minjili). Minji is distinguished from the other clause
combining particles in that it has scope over the first clause in the two-clause
sequence, whereas the other particles connect the second clause with a preceding clause. This difference in scope may account for the different positional properties of minji compared with the other particles described in this section.
Only one speaker (KS) used minji with any frequency in her discourse. Other
speakers clearly recognize and accept the form as Garrwa, but do not use it much.

similar to the other clause-combining particles. In these contexts, it seems that
minji has a more temporal meaning (i.e., ‘when X happens, Y will happen’), but
this requires further investigation.

and TD acknowledges this in (10.5e). TD then resumes telling her childhood story.
Barri occurs directly after the locative marked pronoun bulandu ‘with those two’.
The use of barri reinforces the link between the referent of the pronoun and the
women who have just been mentioned. More examples of barri in discourse are
in (10.6) to (10.8) below.
In terms of its distribution, barri may occur anywhere in an utterance, but
it rarely occurs turn-initially or at the beginnings of intonation units. It is often
followed by an intonation break (but not always a pause), but rarely occurs turnfinally. It never receives primary stress in utterances it occurs in, and is frequently
cliticized to the preceding word. Barri is not analysed as a clitic, however, as it can
also occur utterance initially, albeit rarely. It never occurs as the only word in an
utterance and so it is not an interjection in Evans’ (1992) sense.
Garrwa speakers readily recognize the presence of barri in utterances and
will repeat them when listening back to recordings. They do not, however, tend
to translate barri when working on English translations of texts. When pressed,
speakers translate barri as ‘now’, although, as outlined below, the contexts in
which it is used are not all compatible with a temporal ‘now’ meaning.¹⁰⁸ Kirton
and Charlie (1996) note that ‘now’ is also given as the translation for the Yanyuwa
particle barra, but “It means ‘now’ in a specialized sense: to bring dramatic
immediacy to the topic or event that it marks” (184-185). It may be that barri/
barra began as a temporal deictic marker and has shifted to mark some kind of
immediacy in terms of information status.¹⁰⁹
Since the meaning of barri does not emerge except in actual discourse contexts, for the rest of this section, I provide some extracts from conversation and
narrative discourse and account for the use of barri in each of the extracts. The
numbers in parentheses indicate the length of silence (a pause or gap between
turns) in seconds. The extract in (10.6) is from a conversation, while (10.7) and
(10.8) come from elicited narrative texts. A detailed explanation follows each
example.
For conversational extracts, I keep the standard Conversation Analysis conventions for transcribing talk. Silences between turns is indicated by a filled108 While it is not uncommon for temporal words such as “now” to grammaticalize into discourse particles (e.g., Aijmer 2002), more analysis is required to determine if and how such a
change may have taken place in Garrwa.
109 The temporal adverbial barrin ‘earlier today/this morning’, which has a long /a/ vowel
and a clear final nasal, may be related to barri, although speakers now do not make an explicit
connection between the two.","[322, 323]"
"7.5.1 -Ji ‘purpose’
Complex clauses marked with –ji ‘purp’ mean ‘do X in order to do Y’. In intransitive clauses, the subject of the subordinate clause must be co-referent with the
subject of the main clause, and is only mentioned in the main clause. In transitive
clauses, the object may also be co-referential.

Like the purposive construction, subordinate clauses marked with -jiwa ‘subsequent’ must share a co-referential subject with the main clause, and they must
denote an event that takes place subsequent to the event in the main clause (‘X
until Y happens’). That is, the event denoted in the subordinate clause marks a
subsequent or concluding action that was brought about by the event denoted in
the main clause. For example, in (7.134), the eating of food is a subsequent action
predicated on the subject first getting up. Similarly, in (7.135), the cooking of the
goanna is framed as the subsequent action which is dependent on the killing
of the goanna in the first instance. In (7.136), the projected recording session is
framed as a subsequent event to the linguist’s return (she was absent at the time
this was uttered).

(8.5.01.1.KS)In all of these examples, -jiwa is used in a context where event X is clearly presented as a precursor or prerequisite to event Y (‘X until Y’). Analysing -jiwa as aVerb inflectional morphology193signal of the endpoint of a sequence of events is, however, also compatible with
a purposive reading. As an endpoint, the second event can be read as the intentional consequence of performing the first event (‘do X in order to Y’). This is the
meaning attributed to -jiwa in Furby and Furby (1977). The suffix -jiwa differs from
-ji in that it does not require the agent of the events to have a conscious intention
(‘Y as a consequence of X’, ‘X leading up to Y’). The following examples appear to
incorporate a (weak) purposive meaning, which indicates the close relationship
between -ji and -jiwa.

states, however. It is not clear from my current data whether the –jiwa marked
clause is viewed as a result.
Another difference between the purposive -ji and the subsequent -jiwa is the
ability for subordinate clauses with -jiwa to occur following the co-ordinating
conjunction baki ‘and’ (described in §9.6.1). The use of baki, which is the regular
conjoiner of temporally ordered clauses, raises the possibility that speakers do
not always treat -jiwa clauses as subordinate. It is not possible for clauses marked
with the other verb inflections to occur with conjunctions. -Jiwa may be special
because it has temporal ordering as part of its core meaning, and this is what may
be motivating its co-occurrence with baki.

The subordinate clauses formed with the irrealis suffix -kanyi must have the same
subject as the main clause. It is commonly used to form complements to verbs of
communication and cognition. It is also used in the formation of negative verbs.
When the main verb is a verb of speaking or cognition, the subordinate clause
represents the action being thought or spoken (e.g., ‘I told her to X’, ‘I thought
about X’) rather than the content of speech/thought as in indirect speech representation. The suffix -kanyi is glossed with irrealis because it always occurs in
contexts where the proposition of the subordinate clause is not realised, which is
usually because the proposition in question is a thought, desire, or words of the
subject of the main clause, and not a representation of the actualisation of the
proposition.

-kanyi occurring in contexts where the purposive clause denotes something done
habitually, or when attention is being drawn to the general utility of the object in
the main clause. It does not denote any particular instance of the event in question. In this sense, the subordinate clause appears to function as a modifier of the
object of the main clause. Examples (7.151) to (7.155) come from Furby and Furby
(1977), but I have re-translated the examples to better reflect the use of the irrealis
suffix to signal certain kinds of habitual behaviours.

The contexts in which these morphemes may be used is restricted to simultaneous actions, ones where the activity described in the switch-reference marked
clause must coincide in time with the event / activity in the main clause. Examples (7.156) to (7.159) illustrate this. In this sense, switch-reference marked clauses
are aspectually activities.
The suffix -jina marks co-reference between the subject of the main clause
and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., subject control), while -kurri marks
co-reference between the object of the main clause and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., object control).

reference coding, there do not seem to be any general valency restrictions with
respect to switch reference marking. These clauses can be transitive or intransitive. Note that the subject of the transitive subordinate clause takes its case
marking from its role in the main clause. That is, it does not have the expected
ergative marking but rather absolutive marking as the object of the main clause.

reported speech contexts. That is, the content of speech does not count as a
simultaneous action. This is interesting because the content of perception does
count as a simultaneous action for the purposes of switch reference marking. One
explanation is that speech representation (whether direct or indirect) involves a
shift in perspective from the framing clause of speech to the content of speech.
Perception sentences do not involve a shift in perspective.
Note also that switch reference is not used when the content of speech
expresses some embedded illocutionary force, such as a command (-kanyi is used
in these contexts).

is represented as direct speech with a deictic shift to future tense in the second

7.6.1 -Wa “still”
This aspect-like morpheme is used to indicate that the action denoted by the
verb is still going or continuing. Because this morpheme seems exclusive to verbs
(there is another homophonous morpheme -wa that attaches to directionals and
demonstratives to reinforce directionality – see §6.1.3.2) and not associated with
a position, I do not analyse this as a tense/aspect clitic. Semantically, it has more
in common with other aspectual clitics.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217]"
"8.2.1 Ngawamba ‘only, just’
This particle restricts what is under its scope to that and only that. Ngawamba
precedes that which it has scope over. It frequently occurs clause or utterance
initially where it may attract TA clitics (which (8.140) illustrates) and secondposition pronouns. It can have scope over a nominal (which (8.141) ilustrates) or
an entire clause (which (8.142) illustrates). It is not clear how such scope relations
are established formally. In (8.141), it is clear from the contexts that the scope of
ngawamba is over the nominal (i.e., only the auntie was taken, not other people)
and not over the whole clause (i.e., *only took the auntie, not did other things),235Modifying particleseven though the verb is what immediately follows the particle and the nominal is

(15.5.01.1.DG)8.3.4 Jala ‘relative’
Like ngala, jala relates events and situations in terms of their temporal organization. Clauses marked by an initial jala indicate that the event or situation occurred
or is occurring within the same time period as the event or situation denoted in
the first clause (‘X occurred while/when Y occurred’). Unlike ngala, however,
there is no implication of contrast between the events in question. Rather, the250Clitics and particlessecond clause is interpreted as relative in time (and sometimes space) to the first
clause.⁷⁹
Jala shares syntactic properties with both baki and mada in some respects
and ngala in others. Jala is like baki and ngala because they almost exclusively
occur utterance and clause initially. Like baki and mada, but unlike ngala, jalamarked clauses have their own tense/aspect marking, which is usually directly
marked on the particle (cf. Ngala clauses, which do not have tense/aspect
marking). Like baki, jala can directly take the =yili habitual clitic (which (8.200)
illustrates). Unlike baki, however, there is the distinct past-tense form jali (which
may be jala=yi) that (8.198) and (8.199) illustrate. Like ngala, but unlike baki and
mada, a pronoun usually directly follows jala if there is a pronoun in the clause.
This makes jala look like an initial element in the clausal core (like ngala), but
one that can take its own tense/aspect marking. There are no examples in the
corpus of modal clitics attaching to jala.

(20.6.08.DG)Some clauses with jala are used to modify a proposition or referent in the previous clause to say something about the kind of place or time it is. This is similar to
how some relative clauses are used in English. In (8.200), which is from a conversation, the speaker says she will go “south” (i.e., to Alice Springs), a place where
she will be fed bush tucker. The jala-marked clause thus says something more
about the south place.","[266, 267, 268]"

‘I saw the man (while he was) hitting the woman on the head with a

Furby (1977) represent (9.26) and (9.27) as verbless sentences (see §9.2 below), but
we can conceivably represent these as elaborated noun phrases in translation.
Therefore, I put the copula in parentheses in the translation line. It should be
noted, however, that speakers rarely use such constructions and are more likely
to elaborate reference by juxtaposing clauses.

translated with an English relative clause, but the corresponding Garrwa does not
support this rendering.","[278, 279]"
"10.2 Discourse particles marking stance
Stance-marking is a broad term for the linguistic resources that indicate (among
other things) what kinds of (speech) actions are being undertaken, how recipients should understand the utterance in terms of speaker’s subjective viewpoint,
and how listeners receive information. In this section, I focus on the range of
particles that speakers use to indicate aspects of stance in discourse.",[327]
"Case frames and argument structure185In order to account for the different patterns of predicates and arguments and
their respective case frames found in the data, I identify four basic constructions
that express these interactions: intransitive, transitive, semi-transitive, and reflexive/reciprocal, into which verbs may fit.⁶¹ The transitive and intransitive constructions are mutually exclusive (verbs are found in one or the other), but there
is scope for these verbs to occur in semi-transitive and reflexive frames if their
semantics is compatible. In the following sections, I describe the four constructions (for more on case marking and roles, see §4.4) and give some examples of
the kinds of verbs that regularly occur in each type of construction.
a) Intransitive constructions comprise an S-argument only in an unmarked case
(nominative or absolutive).⁶² An overt S-argument, especially in third person singular contexts, is not obligatory. Basic motion and stance verbs tend to occur in
intransitive constructions.

for the subject in an intransitive construction, and ‘O’ for the object in a transitive construction.","[202, 203]"
