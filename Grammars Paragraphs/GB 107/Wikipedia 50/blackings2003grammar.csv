Modals and negation
This chapter discusses a group of words which have similar syntax, and
express modality and affirmation/negation:
ra'
wà
kpe
kú
küruexpressing affirmation, completion (and perhaps
also necessity)
possibility
non possibility
non-past negation
past negationThese words are found 'bare' and also in combination with the definite
article n. The structure with π is discussed in detail in the Focus chapter
(19.11).17.1. ra : affirmation, certainty
The word ra comes at the end of the sentence. The sentence can be
interpreted as past or future (depending on the verb, uninflected or
inflected respectively). The sentence cannot have a present interpretation,
even if the verb is inflected (nonpast). This has the consequence that if ra'
is combined with an inflected (nonpast) verb, the sentence can only have a
future interpretation,
ra has three meanings:
(a) ra affirms an eventuality, perhaps with some sense of personal
endorsement that it has happened or will happen, thus with some kind
of evidential force.
(b) ra' functions as a modal of necessity: it can be used to indicate that
something must take place.
(c) ra' is a 'generic completive' indicating the completion of an
eventuality.
Meanings (a) and (b) are clearly related, and are the 'modal' meanings of
ra. These meanings differentiate it as an affirmative form from negative
ku or kuru, and as a necessity form from possibility wà. Meaning (c) is
more like an aspectual meaning, forcing a perfective interpretation on a
clause. This might explain why ra' is not found in a sentence with a
present tense intepretation because the present is always imperfective in452Modals and negationMa'di. In its completive meaning it can act as a generic substitute for
other completive particles which are specifically selected by verbs
(18.2.2.1). We gloss ra' as AFF for 'affirmative' and we translate it into
English as 'certainly' or 'definitely' or 'really' or sometimes by
stressing part of the sentence.
Crazzarola (1960: 97) describes the Logbara cognate ra' as expressing
definiteness or determination, the idea that an action has actually taken
place, or that a state really exists or will have to take place.' Djuruni
(1983: 87) translates Logbara ra into French as 'effectivement'.","[468, 469, 470]"

19.11.1.1. Scope over the containing clause
When they are in final position, the negative particles kö and kûrù cooccur only with an uninfected verb. When they are combined with ri this
is no longer the case. The negative particles retain their tenses but now
they agree with the tense of the verb, so that kö ri co-occurs with the
inflected verb (both nonpast) and kûrù ή co-occurs with the uninflected
verb (both past).
kö ri can license a negative polarity item in the main clause.

19.11.2. The position of particle + π
The particle+n combination has the syntax of a free adverbial. In final
position it must be followed by ?J or possibly by LOW-?J with a
phonologically deleted low tone (19.8). The initial position may be a
default position. When the focused item is the subject, the nominalized
modal/negation always precedes the subject. When the focused item is the
object, and the ?1 or null strategy is used (including in the latter, sentenceinternal null-focused objects) the nominalized modal/negation always
precedes the object. Thus in the following sentence, kü η can come at the
beginning of the sentence, or after the subject.

"FOC17.4. Negation: ku (nonpast) and küru (past)
'Descriptive negation' with ku or küru is the basic kind of negation,
where the sentence states that something did not happen, is not happening,
or will not happen. Descriptive negation is achieved by placing ku or küru
at the end of the sentence. The negation particles also have focus-related
behaviour, discussed in the focus chapter: icü can be used to contrastively
negate a constituent of the sentence (19.10.2); both kü and küru combine
with η to form freely placed adverbials (19.11). Phonologically kü fits a
general pattern in Nilo-Saharan where a negative word often has the
phonological structure [k]+vowel (Bender 2000: 65).
17.4.1. Negation and tense
In descriptive negation, the verb is always uninflected, never inflected. The
uninflected vs. inflected distinction normally expresses tense on the verb;
in descriptive negation, the tense is expressed instead by the negation
particle. Djuruni (1983: 91) proposes a functional explanation of why
descriptive negation in Logbara takes the 'past tense' syntax, which is
that the past is like negation in that they both involve 'non-presence'.
Some descriptions of Central Sudanic languages propose, in our view
incorrectly, that the distinction between kü and küru or cognates is one of
aspect rather than tense, parallel to a claim made in these descriptions that
object-verb order distinguishes aspect rather than tense (8.4.2.4).
17.4.1.1.ku : nonpast¿¿»combines with an uninflected verb, and expresses nonpast (present or
future) tense. The combination of the uninflected verb with ku appears to
be equivalent to the inflected verb in that it expresses nonpast, eitherNegation: ku(nonpast) and kûrù (past)467habitual, progressive or future.

"Tense and aspectThe distinction between inflected and uninflected verbs, and between the
negation particles kö and kuru, is a distinction in tense: between nonpast
and past respectively. In other descriptions of Central Sudanic languages,
this distinction has been characterised as a distinction in aspect, but we do
not consider this correct for Ma'di. A non-past clause is sometimes
ambiguous between a present and a future interpretation, but in general a
present interpretation is taken as the default interpretation unless a future
interpretation is forced by the presence of some other element in the
clause, not necessarily having any specifically future meaning, such as the
affirmative modal ra, a future adverbial, etc. Present tense correlates with
imperfective aspect, progressive or habitual. Nonpast (past and future)
tense correlates with perfective aspect. Habitual and progressive can be
expressed in past or future sentences by periphrastic means. Non-verbal
clauses are nonpast by default. It is possible to express past states
periphrastically by embedding the non-verbal clause under a verb which
shifts the clause into the past.",[35]
"The unmarked interpretation is that the event has happened once before;
multiple previous occurrences can be indicated by using the iterative öprefix on the verb. Temporal modifiers can be used in combination with
gbù only if they are generic rather than referring to a specific time.

"Inflected verbs are normally imperfective if present and

correlates with the interpretation of the verb as specifically future. This
means that future can be differentiated from present by the presence of
the perfective affirmative particle ra which affirms the completion of an
action (and can be used with either past or nonpast verbs).
A sentence with a verb interpreted as imperfective can in principle be

The verb is negated by a sentence-final negation word kü or küru; the

they are either fixed in final position or can be nominalized by adding the
determiner π and are then freely placed within the clause, negating
specific constituents of the sentence. Note that this kind of negation is
compatible with an inflected verb.

We might see the incompatibility between ra and the present as arising
from any of these meanings. Perhaps the affirmative force of rá isInterpretation167redundant in the present because the 'affirmativity' of the present comes
from its happening right now. Similarly the modal force might be
redundant if something actually is happening right now. It might also be
that the completive meaning of ra is incompatible with the imperfectivity
of the present in Ma'di. Note that ra does not specifically code future;
thus it can be used in past sentences as well as non-past sentences.

AFF19.11 Focus and Modals/negation/adverbial + ri
Modals, negation particles and fixed adverbials normally appear 'bare' at
the end of the clause. However, they can also be combined with ii to give
for example ra ri and then are treated like freely placed adverbials. They
are found only in sentences with focus on an argument. Verbal focus,
discussed in 19.12, will not license these forms. The particle + ri
construction functions like some of the other free adverbials such as êsu
in that it takes a clause which is complete, and fully interpreted, and then
'relocates' it. Thus there are free adverbials (and drònà π) which take a
clause and shift its temporal reference point. What the nominalized
modals and negation seem to do is something similar. Thus for example
kü ri takes a full affirmative clause with a focused argument, and then
says that for the focused argument the clause is not the case, or rá π says
of the focused argument that the clause is certainly true.

As (88) and (89) show, dri has two peculiarities when it is itself
inflected. First, the inflected form of the verb can be interpreted as past;
this is in fact the typical way of expressing past sequence in a narrative.
Second, the inflected forms of the verb, third person and indefinite, have
non-standard pronominale, with kádri rather than the expected kódrì in
the third person and ádri rather than the expected adrì dri in theGrammatical verbs which express sequence425indefinite. We suggest that the morphological peculiarities of the
pronouns can be resolved by suggesting that the inflected form of drì is
actually ádñ, thus a suppletion rather than a prefixing of the low tone.
Thus the third person would have kó-ádi which would resolve to kàdrì,
and the indefinite might result from adding a high tone prefix to ádn.
When sentences with inflected drì end in ra or kü or kûrù and a high
tone, a kind of conditional warning meaning emerges. The negation
particles are contrastive (19.10.2, 19.10.3.1). The high tone is probably
the yes-no question morpheme (20.3.1.1).

"The low prefix on subordinate verbs compared with the low

unrealized in the same phonological contexts; and (b) both are present in
Lokai and both absent in 'Burulo.
Reasons for thinking that the two morphemes are different are (a) the
low prefix on inflected verbs codes nonpast, but the low prefix on
subordinate suffixed verbs is compatible with any tense interpretation;
and (b) inflected verbs cannot be negated while suffixed verbs can.

particles. They tend to be sentence-final, can be 'nominalized' with n, can
be left-dislocated, and sometimes show restrictions in combination with
past or nonpast verbs. Some of the fixed final adverbials are selected by
specific verbs, while others can be combined with any verb. Adverbials
which are selected by specific verbs often express the completion or
exhaustion of the action. Some of the adverbials are homophonous with
singular adjectives (6.6.2), such as péléré, but this is not true of all the
completion adverbials. Thus pi for example is only an adverbial.
