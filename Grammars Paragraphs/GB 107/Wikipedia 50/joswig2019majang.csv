"Although this sentence has some morphological complications, such as the
use of a serial-verb construction to express an associated motion, and the usePragmatically Marked Structures375of the dative to express possession on a kinship noun, the sentence does not
deviate from the basic clause configuration. The verb is directly followed by
an absolutive noun phrase, and therefore none of the pragmatic markings
provided by the language are in evidence. The verb appears in the conjoint
form, indicating that the P is non-topical, and no sentence-final topicality
marker is placed. The constituent order is in compliance with the canonical
VAP of Majang.
Other pragmatically relevant features are also set to the default: the sentence
is affirmative, and therefore has no negative morphology. It is a declarative
sentence, therefore there is no question morphology or sentence tone involved, and also no imperative or jussive morphology is in evidence.
This section now presents the effects of any changes to this default pragmatic setting: markings for individual constituents as topical or focus, negation, questions, and imperatives with jussives.","[380, 381]"
"If this example consisted just of a negative verb phrase, then one would expect the SFT-marker to be placed at the end of the sentence. But this can never
be done. Unseth (1989b, p. 111) therefore correctly assumes that the negative verb needs to be seen as a complement of the negative auxiliary. This
also fits its nature as a nominalization, which is quite often formally identical
to the infinitive.
Verbless predicates are negated by the use of a negative copula:
Example V.88: use of negative copula
mókò ìɟáːgL cìnɔ̀ kómój òmóŋL ŋɔ̀nk dákɛːɗà.
mókò ìɟáːgL
cì-n-ɔ̀
kómój
òmóŋL
COP\NEG work\SG.ABS REL-SG-DIST kind\SG.ABS one
Work is not just of one kind.ŋɔ̀nk
SUBdákɛːɗà
onlyThis negative copula works like affirmative copulas in that it stays the same
for all persons; it is further specified by a regular personal pronoun:
Example V.89: use of negative copula
moko eːt àgàltL!
moko eːt àgàltL
COP\NEG 1S
thief\SG.ABS
I am not a thief!",[385]
"378Chapter V.7V.7.2 Negation
Negation is pragmatically marked in the sense that it asserts that “some
event, situation or state of affairs does not hold” (T. Payne, 1997, p. 282).
For a thorough treatment of this aspect of Majang grammar, see Unseth
(1994). The Majang language uses a fully inflectable auxiliary k- (see section IV.3.5) for creating negative sentences in conjunction with the negative
verbal nouns introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
The negative auxiliary takes the place of the verb in the clause, whereas the
lexical negative verb form follows later as a complement to the auxiliary
predication.
Example V.85: negative auxiliary and negative verb
a) nɛ kìr cɛːnà gájɛːL òláːtL bàŋɛ.

"IV.3.8.1 Pragmatic particles
Pragmatic particles are used by the speaker to interact with other speech-act
participants. The following is a list of pragmatic particles identified in
Majang.
In Majang agreement is expressed with the affirmative particle ǐː.

"There is also a negative existential form, which, just as the affirmative form
L
làkɛ , is an impersonal verb form:

"Negative imperatives use the hortative particle kàt in front of a simple mainclause verb form. This implies that kàt is not a negative auxiliary form, but
rather a negative hortative particle, filling the same slot as ìn and koL in example IV.185. Otherwise one would expect the use of a negative verb form
following kàt.",[276]

"Only for the 2nd person plural, the imperative form is used in the negative,
instead of the simple main clause verb form. Again, the negative hortative
particle is used:

"In both cases, the two questions do not differ in their order of constituents or
in any other morphological way from their affirmative counterparts. The
only difference is a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause, as in
the following (stereo) pitch curve of example a):Figure 10: pitch drawing of máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?",[389]
"IV.3.5 Auxiliaries
There are not many auxiliaries in the Majang language. Auxiliaries are
lexically empty verbs whose purpose is to provide the grammatical
information needed for another verb that comes in a reduced grammatical
shape, but that provides the semantic content to the proposition (T. Payne,
1997, p. 84).
The morpheme that fits this definition best is the negative auxiliary k- that is
needed to precede the negative verb forms introduced in section IV.2.2.1.
Whereas the negative verb form is unchanged for all persons, the subject
information is provided by the negative auxiliary.
The negative auxiliary, just like verbs, has different endings for the 1 st, 2nd
and 3rd person in the singular and plural:314Chapter IV.3Example IV.268: conjugation of the negative auxiliary
1S kà pàːkkà
2S kín pàːkkà
3S kí pàːkkà
1P kíː pàːkkà
2P kí *ːr pàːkkà
3P kír pàːkkàI am not hot
you are not hot
it is not hot
we are not hot
you are not hot
they are not hot
SGPLUnseth (1989a, p. 119) recorded the negative marker as kù-, which is probably a dialectal variation that I did not encounter during my data collection.
Getachew (2014, p. 177ff) seems to have recorded the negative marker without the vowel /ù/.
The negative auxiliary can undergo further inflection than just the bare person suffixes seen above. It can appear with the impersonal marker:
Example IV.269: impersonal negative auxiliary
máL tɛːnàn ɟéːmɛL kɛːL rɔ̀ːríjáːtìŋ.
máL tɛːnàn
ɟéːmɛL
k-ɛːL

but instead previously NEG-IMPS teach\NEG
But they were not previously taught.","[319, 320]"
"Example a) shows that some material can be placed between the auxiliary
and the negative verb, such as a dative pronoun. Interestingly, I have not encountered a single example where the subject appears between the auxiliary
and the negative verb. Unseth (1989b, p. 119) seems to have found such examples, however, so this is apparently a sporadic gap in my data and not a
structural one. My language consultants accept Unseth’s following example
as grammatical:
Example V.86: subject between negative auxiliary and negative verb

k-í
kɔ̀
joːsep
ɓokot-iːt
NEG-3S RECPST
Joseph\NOM kill-NEG
Joseph didn’t kill a lion.ɗɛpɛL
lion\SG.ABSThe subject can also be placed following the negative verb form, as happened in example V.85a).",[384]
"In this example, the auxiliary verb óːl ‘can’ is used in the negative form
L
óːlɛː . This needs to be preceded by the negative auxiliary k-, which is in this
context used in its 1S form kà. Negative verb forms cannot be used without
such a preceding negative auxiliary.
It appears that the negative verb formation is based on the formation of infinitives. For almost half of all the verbs in the sample, the form of the infinitive is identical in all respects to the negative form. This is particularly true
for most of the verbs forming their infinitive with the suffixes -ɛːt and -iːt.
All the verbs forming their infinitives with -iːt do the same for the negative
verb form. Of all the verbs forming their infinitive with -ɛːt, only nine do not
use this marker for the negative. One of these, with the infinitive làptɛːt ‘to
die’, uses the suffix -ànL for the negative làptànL. The other eight use the
suffix -iːt, which is regularly used for all ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs ending with the
detransitivizing marker -ɗiːL.

burnThe last two of these examples show high-toned base stems, which form
their infinitives regularly with -ɛːL. They, too, end their negative forms on
L
-iːt , which copies the root tone and is followed by a floating L. It is difficult
to determine whether this is the same suffix as the -iːt of i-class verbs, or another suffix -tL just used for the negative form. A suffix -tL is also used for
the six verbs using the durative stem extension -àː, such as rɔ̀ːríjàː ‘teach’, infinitive rɔ̀ːríjɔ̀nL, negative rɔ̀ːríjàːtL. Other high-toned negative -iːtL markers
are found on five a-class verbs, such as ɗegeger ‘agree’, infinitive ɗegeger,
negative ɗegegeríːt.
The verbs that form their infinitives with -ɛːL or -íːL (and that don’t pick the
same marker for the negative) have an almost identical negative form -ɛːɗVerbs221(38 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs) or -íːɗ (20 i-class verbs); the implosive is only dropped in
the absolutive form of the infinitive. If the implosive is not dropped, then the
final H is realized as a HL sequence. In any case, all other tones on the stem
are replaced by a H that spreads across the whole word.

trapIn the same way, the suffix set -ànL/-ɔ̀nL is not only used for the infinitive,
but also for negative verbs, although in smaller numbers than the previously
mentioned suffixes. Only seven i-class verbs use it for the negative, whereas
the other eleven i-class verbs which use -ànL for the infinitive instead use -ɛːL
for the negative. Another 16 ɛ-class verb suffixes-class verbs use -ànL for both the infinitive and
the negative, and 14 more use -ɛːL for the negative. In the a-class, six verbs
use -ànL and its tonal varieties for both the infinitive and the negative, and
seven more use -ɛːL for the negative instead of -ànL. Among these are some
low-toned manifestations of the marker -ɛːL.

they often involve slight changes to the stem vowel or to the tone. The only

The infinitive and the negative forms can be derived from practically all verb
stems, and they lead to verbal nouns which are used in certain grammatical
contexts. These are, according to Comrie and Thompson (1985, p. 350ff),
action/state nominalizations. But, beyond these two forms, there are other
ways to derive nouns from verbs with a more lexicalized meaning, called
argument nominalizations by Comrie and Thompson. They (1985, pp. 351–
357) sub-categorize this kind of nominalization into a number of more detailed types, such as agentive nominalization, objective nominalization, instrument nominalization, and locative nominalization. In Majang, there is no
one-to-one correlation between these nominalization types and any of the
various nominalization forms introduced in the following sections.","[226, 227, 228, 229]"
"Pragmatically Marked Structures379The combination of negative auxiliary and negative verb does not create a
unified verb phrase; this can be concluded from the fact that the sentencefinal topicality marker is never used following a negative verb:
Example V.87: no SFT-marker following negative verb
kíːL gájɛːL.
k-íːL
gàj-ɛːL
NEG-1P
succeed-NEG
We don’t succeed.","[384, 385]"
"IV.2.1.3 Infinite verbs
There are two different infinite verb forms in Majang: infinitive and negative. For the majority of verbs these forms can be accomplished by adding a
productive suffix to the stem. These suffixes are presented in section
IV.2.2.1 Infinite verb forms below. Both forms are syntactically verbal
nouns, but at least the infinitive can still serve as the semantic predicate of a
subject or object clause (see examples IV.100 and V.121). The negative
form is quite restricted in its use, but the infinitive form has all the morphological characteristics of a noun, which means that it can be inflected for
number and case. Many nouns of the lexicon are in fact lexicalized infinitive
forms. Other nouns are derived from verbs by the use of some less productive nominalization devices provided by the Majang morphology; these often
result in lexicalized meanings, not as predictable as the ones gleaned from
the infinitive or negative verb forms.",[217]
"Negative conditional clauses
Negative conditional clauses are protases which state that a condition is not
met. They usually also have a negative apodosis. In the following example
the rare situation is encountered where the protasis follows the apodosis.",[408]
"The following are the negative auxiliaries with direction markings:

"It is also possible to create negative purpose clauses:

àgútL ɟìkon nɔ̀ mó
túːk-íːɗ=k
because what CONJ COP-NEG join-PURP.3S

"Furthermore, the negative auxiliary is also the carrier of any directional inflection marking:

kìːkíːL túːkɛːL ɟóːpL ɔ̀gɔ̀ wàlɛc.

"As can be seen in figure 11, this question marker does not prevent the marking of the polar question by sentence tone. The question marker is not obligatory for marking questions, but it seems to be used particularly when the
question is a complex sentence, and it marks the question as such already
near the beginning of the sentence.
A second question marker is joː, which seems to particularly stress the polarity of a question:Pragmatically Marked Structures385Example V.96: question marker joː

"The negative purpose clause also uses the conjunction nɔ̀, followed by the
negative copula mó, and it uses the purpose marker on the verb.",[410]
"This negative protasis does not make use of the conjunction ɔ̀kɔ̀n ‘if’, but
begins with the conjunction cluster máL tɛːnàn ‘but instead’. Only the use of
the conditional clitic at the end of the clause makes it evident that this is
indeed a conditional clause; it cannot be an SFT-clitic, as such never follows a
negative verb.",[409]
"All three clauses in these two examples are realis, and therefore are not expected to display any particular marking that indicates their realis status.
The conjunction ɔ̀kɔ̀n ‘if’ is the introduction to the protasis part of a conditional construction. Such a clause is conceptually irrealis, and therefore the
apodosis, which depends on the truth value of the protasis, also needs to be
seen as an irrealis form. But even in a counterfactual conditional situation,
no particular irrealis marking takes place:
Example V.76: counterfactual conditional without special irrealis marker
ɔ̀kɔ̀n kɔ̀ làk dúnděŋ gúnL kɔ̀ kí rérín
ɔ̀kɔ̀n kɔ̀
làk
dúndé=ŋ

k-í
if
RECPST have\3S.CJ heart\SG.ABS=CND before RECPST NEG-3S.DJ
If he had had a heart, he would not have died before.rér-ín
die-NEGFurther irrealis situations are negative clauses and imperatives/jussives,
which are treated in their respective sections V.7.2 and V.7.4.1. For these,Tense, Aspect and Mode371too, it can only be noted that they are semantically irrealis, but they show no
particular irrealis marking beyond the negative or imperative morphology.
One way in which the Majang language does show the irrealis nature of the
clause is the use of the clause combining conjunction ɛ. It is used instead of
the conjunction nɛ if two clauses are connected that are each either negative,
or the protasis of a conditional construction, or assumed future events.

"Example a) has the irrealis conjunction between two protasis clauses; in
example b) it is between two future clauses, and in example c) between two
negative clauses. As all these factors can be seen as providing an irrealis environment, the use of this different conjunction ɛ therefore seems to indicate
this change of mode.",[377]
"328Chapter IV.3329Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic Topics
This part of the language description deals with the use of the various forms
explored in the previous sections, focusing on what they accomplish mostly
from a functional perspective. Section V.1 investigates the structure of the
noun phrase, and section V.2 does the same for verb phrases. In section V.3,
the structure of the various kinds of simple clauses is presented, and section
V.4 surveys the semantic functions of various noun phrases. Sections V.5 to
V.6 briefly deal with further syntactic topics (valence-changing constructions and tense, aspect and mode). Section V.7 lists a number of pragmatically marked structures, such as fronting, negation, questions, focus and imperatives. Section V.8 investigates the various ways to combine clauses to complex sentences, and section V.9 addresses topics relating to topical continuity
and discontinuity.","[333, 334, 335]"

The following is an alphabetic list of all bound morphemes of the Majang
language, as encountered in this work. V in a prefix stands for the first stem
vowel in a total vowel harmony context. In a suffix it refers to the class vowel of the verb (à, ɛ, or i). The following tonal conventions are used to refer to
the underlying tone of the morpheme:
•-i (no tone indicated): a toneless morpheme – the morpheme copies
the previous tone.","[19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"

I want to thank the following people for their contribution to this study:
The main language consultant for this study was Joseph Kalakun. In many of
the research sessions Joseph was supported by his colleagues of the Majang
Bible Translation Project, Hawariyat Babure, Epheson Teramaj, and, until
2011, Abyot Girma. This was graciously permitted by the Illubabor Bethel
Synod of the EECMY. James Kim and Gallo Aylate helped setting up the research sessions. Furthermore, James and his wife Whashu shared their
knowledge and material on the Majang language.
Other Majang speakers contributing to this work were Yordanos Addisu,
Kadiree Nyamor, Nibeyat Dimesse, and Ashine Astin.
Tyler Schnoebelen generously shared his personally collected Majang Data
with me. Sandra Hufnagel transcribed most words of the Comparative African Word List, initially supported by Stefanie Hauser.
Pete Unseth shared more data and analysis with me. He once intended to
write this very language description, and I am glad that he entrusted me with
completing this work.
I am grateful to Drs. Moges Yigezu and Getachew Anteneh for the ideas and
inspiration we shared with each other while working on the same language.
I benefited from practical help by various friends and colleagues. David Ford
spent hours editing sound files, and even more on proofreading. Seyoum
Berhe translated materials from Amharic to English. Tefera Endalew provided logistical help in Mizan Teferi. Other workers of the Bench-Maji MLE
project, particularly Efrem Belay, helped me immensely in later stages.
My doctoral supervisor Maarten Mous and co-promoter Constance KutschLojenga gave good feedback on all parts of this study, and more came from
the committee members Gerrit Dimmendaal, Doris Payne, Jenneke van der
Wal and Maarten Kossmann. Further conversations I had with Mary Pearce,
Keith Snider, Helga Schröder, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland, Mike
Bryant, Joshua Smolders, Anne-Christie Hellenthal, Don Killian, Manuel
Otero, Mike Cahill, Roger Blench, and Tom Payne. More occasional advice
was given by numerous participants on the SIL Linguistics Discussion List.
Colin Davis created the language map on page 37. Anne-Christie Hellenthal
provided the Dutch Samenvatting at the end of this book.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

"V.7.1.1 Cleft constructions
Cleft constructions are not a frequently used device, at least based on the
sample of texts analyzed for this study. Only one affirmative cleft construction was encountered:

only=SUBThe clefted nominal clause is introduced by the copula ègè. This is then followed by a relative clause. This clause was used as a conclusion following a
lengthy procedure described in the previous paragraph. The cleft construction with anaphoric demonstrative therefore puts a strong focus on the described procedure, which is the transitive object of the nuclear clause.
107In this context, the NP always comes in the absolutive case.",[382]

"Infinite verb forms
The Majang language makes use of two infinite verb forms; they are based
on verb roots, but not inflected for person, conjoint/disjoint, or relative tense.
Instead, they can be at least partially inflected like nouns. As their formation
is very closely linked with the formation of lexical nominalizations, it is assumed that these forms are derivations from the verb. Semantically, the infinitive and the negative verb forms can be analyzed as action nominalizations
(see section IV.2.2.1). Many of these verbal-noun formations use more or
less productive suffixation processes, but even where this is the case, other
changes to the stem are frequent.",[218]
"Verbs211two of the set of three direction markers, centripetal and centrifugal. The
deictic-transfer direction marker is regularly placed following any relativetense marker. The relative-tense slot is used for a few morphemes connecting the verb to its pragmatic temporal setting, and only in subordinate
clauses. Although the referential-object suffix is identical to one of the
relative-tense forms, it does not fill the same slot, as it follows other relativetense suffixes.
Some person markings are characterized by tonal changes on the stem. The
person-marking suffixes themselves are portmanteau morphemes that also
carry the conjoint-disjoint distinction of the language. Conjoint forms indicate that the immediately following NP in the absolutive case is non-topical.
In all other situations, the disjoint form is used (see section III.3 for information on the use of this distinction).
Aspect is expressed through the choice of different verb stems, with the imperfective aspect using a reduplicated version of the perfective root.
Other grammatical categories often associated with verbs in other languages
are not expressed through inflectional categories on the verb in Majang: absolute tense and modality use other means, such as free particles or auxiliary
verb constructions.","[216, 217]"

"212Chapter IV.2IV.2.2 Derivation processes for verbal roots
This section explores the derivation processes that operate on verbal roots. It
is not always easy in Majang to decide which verbal markings are to be seen
as derivational and which as inflectional. Nominalization is certainly a derivational device, and the main-clause person marking is clearly inflection.
Other categories may be less clear, such as the impersonal marking or the
various direction forms found in Majang. For the former there are some
indications that place it firmly in the inflectional drawer; for the direction
markings things are less straightforward.
The following processes are described in this section as derivational, as they
produce new stems from verbal roots: nominalizations (with infinitives and
negative verbs), detransitivization, inceptive verbs, durative verbs, and two
more derivation devices with an unclear semantic interpretation. Furthermore, the formation of imperfective verb stems through reduplication makes
it profitable to treat this device in this section.","[217, 218]"

“Grammar and discourse interact with and influence each
other in profound ways at all levels, so that in real life neither
can even be accessed, not to mention explained, without reference to the other.”
This statement by John Du Bois (2003, p. 49) may serve as a fitting tag-line
for this language description, which provides much justification to his idea.
The past few years of my attempts to first understand and then describe the
structure of the Majang language were deeply impacted by this interaction
between grammar and discourse. The project began with a tone workshop
under the guidance of Keith Snider and Constance Kutsch Lojenga in Addis
Ababa in 2008; there I became convinced that another description of the
Majang language would add value to the efforts of previous and contemporary linguists, simply because my newly gained understanding of the tone
system would give me a considerable advantage that was not available to
them. With this confidence about tonal differences, I felt that I could open
doors into the inner systems of the grammar by identifying all the categories
that so far were not described by my colleagues.
I started by analyzing a substantial word list, and then worked on simple
narrative texts. They revealed that Majang had very little to offer in the way
of case marking, as most central constituents appeared to be unmarked for
case. After some time I started branching out from the texts by eliciting further data, and this was the first time that it dawned on me that things might
become more complicated. The consultant at that time returned completely
unexpected tone patterns to me, both on verbs and nouns, so that after a few
days of this I falsely concluded that I could not trust his data and decided not
to work with him again. What is worse, I went through the data I collected
from him and corrected it to the way I thought it had to be, because it just
did not fit my assumptions.
Next then came another workshop, this time about grammar, which was
based entirely on elicited material gleaned from a number of motivated language consultants. After a short time with these men it became very clear
that the Majang language had a surprise in store for me that I did not expect
to find in an African language – a full-blown ergative-absolutive alignment
system, probably the most robust specimen encountered so far in any language on the continent. I went through my text corpus again to change all the30Introductionglosses according to this new discovery, correcting all the data where I must
have misheard things initially. Unfortunately, I ran into more and more difficulties with this, as rather a lot of the early transcriptions did not quite fit the
new revelation.
Some elicited data finally made me aware that there must be some split system regarding intransitive subjects. Often they came out with different cases
than the absolutive I expected, and I presented this as some kind of split-S or
fluid-S system at the 2015 Nilo-Saharan colloquium in Nairobi. Later, I
checked my data again and discovered what seemed closer to the truth, a
split-ergativity system based on the pragmatic parameter of topicality, which
fits very well into the framework provided by typologists (section III.2.1.2).
Then going through the tedious job of checking all the paradigms of nouns
encountered in my texts, I made the startling discovery that, with very few
exceptions, ergativity did not appear in any of the texts. I was looking at a
language with two faces – one with a vibrant ergative-absolutive nature
jumping at me from all my elicited grammar data, and another one stubbornly aligned along nominative-accusative characteristics in my texts.
There are explanations for these two natures, grounded in the aforementioned interaction between discourse and grammar. In the discussions that follow
I hope that I do this language justice. One thing I have learned in the process
of preparing this grammar: whatever the linguist finds out depends to a great
extent on the nature of the available data. Had I followed the advice of only
looking at data from natural texts, I would probably not have encountered
the ergative-absolutive nature of this language. Had I only restricted myself
to elicited data, I would not have realized how marginal the structures are in
the language, at least in the kinds of text that are usually analyzed by linguists. I am grateful that somehow I stumbled across the most felicitous mix.
This Majang grammar was written for linguists. This means that it is not particularly useful or even readable for those who want to learn the language, or
for linguistically untrained members of the Majang language community.
Other resources need to be (and hopefully will be) written for them. At least
it is my hope that this language description can serve as a resource for those
who will be creating such works of a less technical and more practical nature. Reading this grammar requires a minimum of linguistic training, which
encompasses familiarity with the terms provided by what is called Basic
Linguistic Theory. This concept is now readily accessible in the three volumes of the same name by Dixon (2010a, 2010b, 2012). Following the con-Introduction31cept of Basic Linguistic Theory entails the commitment to disregard any
particular contemporary grammatical theory or model in its current specialized terminology or formal representation, or to at least reduce it to a minimum. The idea is that even in generations to come, linguists and typologists
will be able to make use of this description without having to first go
through a course on the intricacies of linguistics in the early 21 st century. I
hope to accomplish this goal by providing sufficient definitions for all terminology that is not part of Basic Linguistic Theory, and by refraining from
any kind of formal representation that is not self-explanatory. Contemporary
readers who hope to find explanations and representations according to the
latest models will therefore be predictably disappointed. All in all, the focus
is mostly on description, and much less so on explanation.
For the most part, I also refrain from historical statements, and I take no part
in any discussion regarding the placement of Majang or any other higherlevel language family unit in any kind of genetic classification. Where the
presented data supports or contradicts any existing classification, I say so,
but without drawing any further conclusions.
This language description comes in several parts. The division into parts is
inspired by the ideas of both T. Payne (2006) and Noonan (2006), who envisioned the development of user-friendly grammars as coming from two
perspectives: one a form-to-function approach, and the other a function-toform approach. Although this division could not be upheld entirely, these
two approaches are reflected in Part IV: Morphology and Part V: Other
Syntactic and Pragmatic Topics of this language description. But I found it
necessary to add a third part preceding these two perspectives which deals
with the basic facts behind information packaging in the clause (Part III:
Basic Syntax). This is the shortest of the parts in this work, but it introduces
many of the concepts in both form and function that accompany the reader in
all the following sections. It also discusses my choices regarding analysis
and terminology, and explains why some alternative approaches were not
pursued in the interpretation of certain language structures. In a sense Part III
can be seen as the central chapter of the whole description.
Further elements necessary for a helpful language description are found in
the other parts. Part I: The Cultural, Ecological and Sociolinguistic Context
not only provides demographic, ethnographic and sociolinguistic information on the Majang language and the people who speak it; it also gives details on sources and history of this study, and the people involved in it. It fur-32Introductionther contains a short typological summary (section I.11) of the language.
Part II: Phonological Inventory and Orthography presents the findings of
the phonological analysis, which is an integral part of this study, together
with much of the data that underpins these findings. It also explains the particulars of the practical orthography used in this language description.
After the main grammar parts III-V, Part VI: Texts and Lexicon provides
two word lists, one from Majang to English and one from English to Majang,
to give an impression of the Majang lexicon. This is preceded by two sample
narrative texts, which show the language in natural use.
It is my sincere hope that the index provided at the end enhances the usefulness of the grammar to those who do not have the time to read this work
from beginning to end, since this usually describes the largest group of
grammar users.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"
"The three examples display the forms of ‘mother’ for a first person (a), second person (b) and third person possessor (c). There is no unpossessed form
of mother in Majang. Example c) further illustrates a second characteristic of
kinship terms: if they are the head of a possessive NP, their possessor nouns
do not use the regular forms of the possessive (-konk or -k), but they use the
dative form. This trait of kinship terms was already carefully described by
Unseth (1992b, p. 99). Other examples of suppletive kinship forms are the
following:

Verbs in Majang are defined by their various syntactic and morphological
properties, which are different for finite and infinite verb forms. All verbs
can be used in a finite form with person marking, and all verbs can also be
used in the negative and infinitive forms, which are not marked for person.
These criteria, however, also apply to words denoting stative property concepts, which morphologically are very similar to verbs. They are thereforeVerbs209treated as a sub-class of verbs in section IV.2.4, where they are called stative
verbs in line with the nomenclature applied to other Surmic languages.
Readers looking for the category of adjectives in Majang are therefore directed to that section.
Finite verbs are characterized by their ability to serve as the predicate of a
clause, without the use of either a copula or a subject pronoun. More about
the use of verbs can be gleaned from sections V.3.2.2 and V.3.3.","[214, 215]"

This major part of the language description approaches the morphology from
a predominantly formal perspective, showing which forms are used in the
grammar, and what morphological processes account for derivational and
inflectional variation. To provide some much-needed background to the
reader, Part III: Basic Syntax gave an overview over the basic grammatical
distinctions that operate on the noun and the verb. The next few sections introduce the morphology of the various parts of speech. The first of these is
the noun (section IV.1), followed by the verb (section IV.2, including stative
verbs). The other word classes, including pronouns, modifiers, adverbs, auxiliaries, prepositions and particles, are presented in section IV.3.","[149, 150, 151]"
"V.8 Clause Combinations
The following section presents the way in which clauses combine with each
other within a sentence. One needs to distinguish between coordination, that
is the combination of two or more main clauses, and subordination, where
clauses of different status are combined into a complex sentence.
Whenever an utterance in Majang consists of more than one clause, the
grammar of the language prefers some kind of linkage to be expressed between them. Only the initial clause of an utterance stands without a conjunction. This is even the case between sentences; a conjunction is expected to be
placed between them, as in the following section from a narrative:
Example V.114: conjunctions between sentences

"III.2.2.4 Question particles and question words
Unseth (1986a, p. 97) pointed out that the Majang language violates Greenberg’s (1966, p. 111) 12th universal, which states that “if a language has dominant word order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts interrogative words or phrases first in interrogative word questions […].”
This universal is indeed violated in Majang, as the interrogative pronouns
and question words are always found at the end. See section V.7.3.2 for the
use of these interrogative pronouns.
Example III.26: question words at the end of the clause
àríːL kój cáːL òlà cìgì ɛk?
àr-í ,ːL
kój cáːL
òlà
cì-g-ì

"But even this is freely exchangeable with the regular 2P form:

againIV.2.3.5 Referential-object forms
The same forms used for relative-past subordinate clauses can also be used
in main clauses. When this happens, they always attach to transitive verbs if
the object is an activated participant of the discourse and is therefore not
overtly mentioned. In other words, this referential-object form indicates that272Chapter IV.2the object of the proposition has just been talked about and therefore is not
shown in an overt NP. This is a very different situation from the detransitivizing/antipassive marking seen in section IV.2.2.2, which is used only
when the object has no topicality at all and therefore is not worth mentioning. The referential-object marking, instead, has the object not overtly
mentioned because it is topical and activated, and therefore needs no overt
reference. The referential-object marker is not an object suffix, providing a
clear reference to the object, but a marker indicating that the object of the
clause is an activated participant mentioned immediately before. The following example is taken out of a narrative, where the main character speaks
about the other main character:

"The Corpus43I.10.1 The nature of the research
The research conducted for this study was impacted by two main factors: the
requirements of the Leiden University Ph.D. program under which this dissertation was developed, and the expectations I had to meet as a result of my
affiliation with SIL International, working in Ethiopia. Fortunately, both
were not set against each other, and there was a lot of helpful overlap. Still,
having to work in a full-time position resulted in the inevitable neglect this
study received over time, which means that it took much longer than this
kind of research is supposed to take. It also had the disadvantage that I was
not able to spend extended periods of time in the language area, and I did not
develop any active proficiency in the language.
In the Introduction, it was stated that this study is based on both elicited data
and natural texts, against Dixon’s advice (2010a, p. 321ff), who insists that a
grammar should always be based on natural data only, possibly augmented
by data from elicited paradigms to fill gaps. I believe that such a restriction
would have led to a poorer description of this language. I will explain in
section III.2.1.2 why there are good reasons not to expect a high number of
ergative forms in narrative or conversational discourse, which is exactly
what happened in the texts studied for this grammar. Not only was I forced
to elicit ergative structures by using contrived examples, I also had to go
through countless paradigms of both verbs and nouns in order to get a clear
identification of the forms found in the texts. Part IV: Morphology makes it
clear that it is not possible to just look at a verb or, particularly, a noun in
Majang to determine its syntactic status. For practically each noun encountered in a text, I had to collect a full number-case paradigm to be sure of
what particular form I was looking at, especially when it came to centralcase forms, and often even beyond that. Any hope that I would accumulate
sufficient knowledge of forms exclusively from natural texts would have
been totally unrealistic.
My corpus of well-analyzed texts contains 2879 words, availing me with
sufficient material to demonstrate the various structures of the language in
the sections that follow. It is balanced by many pages of elicited sentences
and paradigms. Occasionally I also draw on less well-analyzed texts for examples to illustrate a particular point.
The research began in 2008 with a phonetic transcription of the 1700-word
Comparative African Word List (CAWL, Snider & Roberts, 2004), which
was initially prepared for me in 2007 by two linguistics students, Sandra44Chapter I.10Hufnagel and Stefanie Hauser. This word list, arranged by semantic domains, constituted the main source of information in the very early stages of
this research. Using this resource, I collected the singular-plural paradigm
for each noun, and the main-clause paradigms for all persons for each verb
encountered. It also served as the basis for the tone analysis conducted in
2008 at a tone workshop in Addis Ababa.
This tone workshop introduced me to the methodologies propagated by both
Constance Kutsch Lojenga and Keith Snider 4 and gave me an excellent set of
tools to formulate and test hypotheses. This was amplified by the qualities of
my language consultant during that workshop, Joseph Kalakun, who is a
good whistler and who compares the tone patterns of different utterances
with a high and well-deserved confidence.
A substantial amount of textual material was given to me by both James Kim
and Pete Unseth, who collected these texts years before. I picked some of
these texts, re-recorded them and applied my own transcription. This was necessary, as no tonal information was present in the old transcriptions, and
there was much uncertainty about vowel qualities and quantities. Two of
these texts are presented in section VI.1. Most texts were traditional narratives, but I also analyzed a hortatory text written in the course of a discourse
workshop in the early 2000s, and I recorded a new spontaneous conversation
between the three main consultants, which provided me with structures not
encountered elsewhere in my corpus. Many of these appear as examples in
the following sections.
As I slowly discovered the various case forms of Majang, I devised diagnostic frames that I could apply to all nouns, and in this way I was able to
glean the various nominal paradigms presented in sections IV.1 and IV.2.2.1.
For verbs, I was easily able to collect paradigms about basic finite forms,
nominalizations, infinitives, negative forms, and direction forms. It was
more difficult to create appropriate frames for the subordinate-tense forms.
More and better research can and should be conducted on this, including the
other tense options, aspect and mode.
All texts, all lexical information and much of the grammar was entered into a
database running under the SIL Fieldworks software. For the phonological
analysis I used SIL Phonology Assistant, supported by both Praat and SIL
Speech Analyzer. Much of the paradigm analysis was facilitated by the helpful spreadsheet features of OpenOffice and LibreOffice.
4See Snider (2018) for a recent exposition of his methodology.","[48, 49, 50]"
"The recent-past particle usually does not trigger downstep on a following
high-toned word; the downstep observed here is therefore the morpheme
downstep happening only inside a phonological word. This is confirmed by
the rounding of the vowel of the short pronoun, which again can only happen
inside a phonological word. So in this example the short pronoun has turned
into a pronoun clitic. But I have found no other examples of a similar nature.
Apparently the short pronouns are currently in a transition from free words,
probably hailing from full pronouns, via verb-phrase particles, to pronominal
clitics. It may be predicted that they will develop into object markers on the
verb. Their behavior, in conjunction with the deictic-transfer form to fill the
3rd person gaps, already now creates paradigms that seem to fulfill this function (see example V.46).",[294]
"In these examples, the A of the transitive clause is marked by the ergative
case, as evidenced by the HL sequence on the last syllable of the proper
name in example a), and by the special ergative form of the interrogative
pronoun (see p. 387 for the other case forms of this pronoun) in example b).
In example a), the ergative is chosen for a main participant following a reset
of time and place, and with a different subject than in the previous clause. In
example b) the ergative is used for a question word asking for an unknown
subject; the object of this clause is left-dislocated (see section V.7.1.2) to a
position outside the clause. A less clear example shows an NP in the ambiguous form that is identical for both the modified nominative and the
modified ergative:114Chapter III.2Example III.10: textual example with ergative case assumed by word order

because that hyena had killed his friend,The NP ɗúŋéL cìnɛ can be either nominative or ergative according to its morphological shape. The reason to assume that it is ergative in this clause is its
position following the verb, where in clear textual examples nominative ANPs were never encountered (see section III.2.2.1).
These rare examples taken from natural discourse are balanced by countless
examples from elicitation, using questionnaires with context-free example
sentences, where practically every transitive clause yields an ergative-absolutive pattern, illustrated in the following clauses:

man\SG.ABSUndoubtedly these examples are unnatural in the sense that it is very difficult to find them in narrative discourse. The factor of preferred argument
structure, as proposed by Du Bois (1987, 2003), in combination with the tendency of Majang to avoid free pronouns for subjects, explains the very low
frequency of ergative-marked noun phrases in natural texts. Preferred argument structure discourages the use of a full NP as an A argument. An NP thatCase Marking on Central Constituents115is not there cannot be marked for ergative, which renders the ergative case
invisible in a language that only ever marks it on an NP.
Still, it would be unwise to discount the information gleaned from such examples on the basis that they do not come from narrative texts. It remains a
fact that when a Majang speaker is asked to produce a transitive sentence,
without fail s/he first comes up with an ergative-absolutive case pattern in a
VAP clause. This alignment system therefore represents a deeply ingrained
grammatical structure that probably sees prominent use in everyday natural
discourse, but not in the kind of structured texts that linguists tend to analyze
for writing their grammars. The observer is faced with the notion that “when
a departure from Preferred Argument Structure does occur in natural discourse, the resulting utterance bears not a hint of ungrammaticality” (Du
Bois, 2003, p. 78). After all, “Preferred Argument Structure cannot be reduced to a grammatical rule. It must remain within the domain of discourse,
as a patterning of grammar with consequences for grammar” (ibid).
Now it still needs to be asked where exactly in natural discourse the ergative-absolutive alignment system thrives to the point that it appears as the
grammatical system of choice in almost all elicited transitive clauses; if no
one ever uses it in any speech situation at all, this alignment system would
be quickly forgotten by the grammar. Looking outside the narrative genre, in
my case, did not provide the answer: one text of my corpus is a planning
conversation between three speakers with well over 150 clauses, and still the
ergative case does not feature in this at all. The same is true for a short hortatory text. It therefore remains a rewarding task for future research 32 to determine the segments or genres of Majang natural discourse that freely admit
the use of ergative-absolutive systems. My hypothesis is that they must exist,
and that I just have not found them.
As for the alternative to this ergative-absolutive alignment system: as stated
above, the main reason why it is almost impossible to see ergative-marked
NPs is preferred argument structure. But even an existing A-NP is usually
32Watters (2018, p. 394ff) conducted such research for the Tibeto-Burman language Dzongkha, comparing the impact of genre on competing case-marking patters. For that language,
Watters concluded that “grammatical relations in Dzongkha is found to range from a splitergative system to a pragmatic system, whereby the manifestation of one marking pattern
over another is probabalistically dependent on and functionally motivated by genre.” The
exact findings, however, are very different from the situation in Majang, showing a higher
probability for ergative-marked As in monologic texts.","[119, 120, 121]"
