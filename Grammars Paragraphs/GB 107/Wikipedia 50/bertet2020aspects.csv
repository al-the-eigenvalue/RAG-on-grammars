Tåʼúgù (∼tågù), rather than meaning ‘never’, occasionally appears to merely
̊ ‘neg’
function as a more emphatic alternative for the standard negator tãu
(on which see Section 7.2.1), as in the following example:
(630)Tåʼúgù chā-chíbǜ i ̀ chòmà.
tåʼú-gùchā=chíbǜ i ̀=chò-màbe.absent\sbjv?-ploc 1sg.sbj=eat lk.ns=1sg-anaph‘[He made me drink and now I’m a bit drunk.] I had not eaten.’ [ano1 181]
If several existential indefinites co-occur within a single clause, then only the
first one is negative, while the next ones remain as they would be in the corresponding positive clause. This is illustrated in the following example:
(631)Tåʼúgù mā g̃èʼta̋ nà-ũʼ̂ ü̃́ […].
tåʼú-gù=māg̃èʼta̋be.absent\sbjv?-ploc=precisely where?.alocnà=ũ-̂ ʼü̃́3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=go.sg\sbjv-sub‘He would never go anywhere [...].’ [amb 39]
In other words and more generally, negative polarity is only marked once
within a given clause, and more specifically on the first available locus. This
rule equally applies across different types of negation strategies in cases where
they could in principle co-occur, e.g. when topical-locational negation (on topicallocational negation, see Section 7.2.2) and an existential indefinite post-posed to
it co-occur within the same clause, as in the following example:
(632)[…] nà-tåʼúʼü̃́ gá åkǘ […].

‘[…] there wasn’t anything [in the animal’s mouth] […].’ [lar C438]
Two negative words do occasionally co-occur within a single clause, but with
the consequence that their negative values cancel each other, as in the following
example:
(633)̃̀

575]7.4Negation and phase aspectNegative polarity, whether clausal or non-clausal, never has scope over the second position clitic /=tàa/̃̄ ‘itself’ and the independent particle mārǖ ‘prf’ (or its
proclitic variant /mā=/). Thus:
– /=tàa/̃̄ co-occurring with negative polarity within a clause yields the meaning ‘(not) yet’ (lit. ‘It is still the case that [clause.in.the.negative.polarity]’), as shown in examples (634–636);
– mārǖ (or /mā=/) co-occurring with negative polarity within a clause
yields the meaning ‘(no) longer’ (lit. ‘It has now become the case that
[clause.in.the.negative.polarity]’), as shown in (637–638).305

In clauses involving negative polarity, just like in positive clauses, mārǖ ‘prf’
can appear in different positions. When it comes before the inflected predicative
phrase, it often immediately precedes tãů ‘neg’, as in (637), or the negative indefinite words; but it may also immediately follow them, as in (638). It may as well
immediately follow the inflected predicative phrase, as in the following example:

5337.5. Emphasizing negation
almost fully grammaticalized as a marker systematically co-occurring with negation
(except in cases of privative negation with /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’), with no emphasis effect
implied. The co-occurrence of /=mā/ with negation is by no means systematic in
smat, but its meaning is in many cases bleached in this context.
A rarer but stronger construction used for reinforcing negation can be syntactically interpreted as negation focus (‘It is not the case that …’). In this construction,
the non predicative negative word in a clause (i.e. tãů ‘neg’ or a negative existential indefinite) appears in the regular position of focalized constituents (focalized.
constituent inflected.copula (lk=)clause.in.sbjv-sub; on focalization, see
Section 5.2.6, p.426). From a pragmatic perspective, this construction is often
used when contradiction of a previous statement, an assumption, or a wish is
implied (‘[Contrary to what I/you/they said/believed/want,] negative.clause’).
This construction is illustrated in the following examples:
(642)̃́
“[…] tãů chírḛ níì-ĩ ̊ kūchà-ǘa̋ʼü!”
̊ =chírḛ níì=ĩ ̊
tãu

believe: a mother-in-law talks to her daughter-in-law after berating her
and then realizing she had been mistaken]!”’ [jsg B277]
(643)“Na̋ <tãů tá…> tågù tá níì-ĩ ̊ ì nâpàtǘwa̋ kù-ũʼ̂ ü̃́ […]?”

like you to go there] […]?”’ [jgs 730–731]
Note that the intensifier suffix /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’ only has scope over the word
it is part of. As such, /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’ cannot serve to emphasize negation,
which normally has scope over it, as in example (603) above, unless it occurs on
the negative word itself, as in (617) and (641) above.308
I have no simple explanation for why in the following examples /-ʼV̋chi ̀/ ‘genuinely’, while it is
suffixed to the negative words themselves, does not intensify negation as expected, but rather seems
3085357. Negation
On the occasional use of the negative existential indefinite tåʼúgù (∼tågù) ‘never’
as an emphasized alternative for the standard negator tãů ‘neg’, see Section 7.3
above.","[535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"
"7.2.2Existential and topical-locational negationOne of the few contexts in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally
available as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative
clause is when existential predication is involved (on existential predication, see
Section 3.4.4). In other words, a clause that includes an existential predicative
word in its positive polarity (e.g. Ná-ngēmà i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is pineapples.’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? Tãů ná-ngēmà i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is no
pineapples.’). A dedicated negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’ is regularly
used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause (e.g. Ná-tåʼu
i ̀ chi ̆ʼnü.́ ‘There is no pineapples.’). This is illustrated in the following examples
((610) is repeated from (470)):

91]
Existential negation is occasionally used to express privative negation; tåʼu
could then be glossed as ‘to lack’ (but see Section 7.2.3 below on a more common way to express privative negation). The referent whose being possessed is
negated then appears as a subject argument, and the one whose being a possessor
is negated is encoded as an oblique argument in the benefactive(-malefactive) case
(as in example (612)) or the genitive case (as in (613)) although the latter may also
be omitted altogether and left to be understood from the context (as in (614)):

we had no money [lit. ‘... there was no money’], and there was no [high]
school in Puerto Nariño.’ [ano2 3’51”–3’57”]
Tåʼu ‘be absent’ is also used as the regular way to negate a clause that involves
topical-locational predication. Thus, a clause that includes, in its positive polarity, a locational predicative word not built on the punctual locative relational
5237. Negation
noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ (e.g. Ná-ngĕʼmá i ̀ yői ̀. ‘There’s boas [there].’) can normally
not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? Tãů ná-ngĕʼmá i ̀ yői ̀. ‘There isn’t boas
[there].’). Tåʼu ‘be absent’ is used instead (e.g. Ná-tåʼu i ̀ yői ̀. ‘There isn’t boas
[there].’). The topical location may be explicitly mentioned in the clause expressing negative topical-location (as in example (615)) or not be explicitly mentioned
(as in (616)). Note that by contrast to topical-locational predication, non-topical
locational predication is regularly negated with tãů ‘neg’, as in (606) above.

Note that in practice the semantic distinction between existential predication
(‘something is existing’) and topical-locational predication (‘there is something
[somewhere]’) is hazy in the positive polarity. It is therefore not surprising that
such a distinction should be neutralized in the negative polarity.","[527, 528, 529]"
"7.3Non-clausal negation (negative existential
indefinites)If a clause in the positive polarity contains existential300 indefinites (comparable to English ‘something, somewhere, etc.’) that precede the main predicative phrase, then the standard negator tãů ‘neg’ (on standard negation, see Section 7.2.1 above) is not normally used to negate it. That clause’s existential indefinites are replaced by corresponding negative existential indefinites instead (comparable to English ‘nothing, nowhere, etc.’).301
One part of these negative existential indefinites is productively derived as subject participant relativizations including the negative existential verb root
tåʼu ‘be absent’ (on tåʼu ‘be absent’, see Section 7.2.2 above). Due to their nature
of relativizations, these inflect for nominal class. Their basic forms are listed in
The form timbu stands for local Sp. timbo ‘plastic barrel’. The Spanish word’s phonological form
is slightly adapted when inserted in a smat utterance by code-mixing (see Section 2.7.2.2).
299Indefinites with semantic values other than existential (e.g. specific or universal indefinites)
do not have negative counterparts and do not display the behavior described in this section under
the scope of negation. See example (602) above for a case of negative clause featuring a (positive)
indefinite with a universal meaning (‘just any …’).
300I do not have enough data to explore what happens in cases where within a single clause
there might be a conflict on whether an existential indefinite or the main verb should be the locus
for negative polarity, i.e. cases where an existential indefinite is involved in existential, topicallocational, or privative negation (on these contexts of negation, see Sections 7.2.2–7.2.3), with
meanings such as ‘Wheat never existed in this region.’ or ‘I don’t have anything.’.

to for setting a clause’s polarity to negative. The major functions related to
negative polarity and the morphosyntactic strategies applied to execute them are
briefly summarized in Table 49. These aspects, and a few more, are discussed in
detail in the next sections (the corresponding sections are referred to by numbers
in parentheses in Table 49). For a typological discussion of most of the functions
identified in Table 49, see van der Auwera & Krasnoukhova (2020). The structure of this entire chapter is inspired by Miestamo (2017) and van der Auwera &

Tãů ‘neg’, in its function of general marker encoding the negative polarity of a
clause without affecting in any way its morphosyntactic structure, can be used in a
large variety of contexts. In particular, tãů ‘neg’ occurs:
– with most types of predicative phrases, whether verbal (as in examples (601–
604) and (608–609)) or non-verbal (as in (605–607));
– in both main clauses (as in (601), (603–606), and (609)) and subordinate
clauses (as in (607–608));
– with both the Indicative Inflectional Type (as in (602) and (604–606)) and
the Subjunctive (and Subjunctive + /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’) Inflectional Type (as in (601),
(603), and (607–610));
– and in declarative utterances (as in (601) and (603–606)), interrogative utterances (as in (609)), and exclamative utterances (as in (606)).

̊ ‘neg’ is normally not
However, as will be shown in the following sections, tãu
used:
– in the negation of existential and topical-locational predicates (Section
7.2.2) and that of possessive predicates (7.2.3);
– in the negation of clauses that would feature existential indefinite arguments in the positive polarity (7.3);
5217. Negation
– in association with the Imperative Inflectional Type (7.7).
Tãů ‘neg’, a phonologically anomalous word in that its only syllable combines
an oral onset together with a nasal nucleus, is likely to have arisen etymologically
from a phonetic reduction of /tåʼú-ʼü̃́/ ‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ (lit. ‘(a/the)
non-existing’), i.e. the regular subject participant relativization in the non-salientive nominal class of the negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. /Tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/ ‘be.
absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ is in fact still used in its unreduced form to express meanings
such as ‘no X, none, nothing, nobody’ (see Section 7.3 below). It is unclear, however, through what kind of grammaticalization path a relativization like /tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/
‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ may have ended up functioning as the most general negative marker in smat.","[522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527]"
"7.2.3Privative negationAnother context in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally available as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative clause
is when possessive predication is involved (on positive possessive predication, see
Sections 4.2.5.3 and 4.3.3.6). In other words, a clause that predicates possession
by means of the possessive predicative suffix /-ã/̰ and/or the possessive verb ã̄ ‘to
have’ in its positive polarity (e.g. /chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I have a dog’ or /chā=ã-̄ pátā/
̊
‘I have a house’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? /tãu
̊ chā=ã-̄ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a house’).
chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or ? /tãu
A dedicated privative (i.e. negative possessive) verb root /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’
5247.2. Clausal negation
is regularly used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause
(e.g. /chā=g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or /chā=g̃e-̊ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a
house’).298
As is regularly the case when incorporation of a nominal constituent into the
predicative phrase occurs (on incorporation, see Section 4.2.5), if the referent
whose being possessed is negated is referred to with a bound noun, then the privative predicative word takes on the form /g̃e-̊ /bound.noun (not.have-bound.noun),
as in examples (617–618). By contrast, if that referent is referred to with a full NP
(and with an independent noun in particular), then the privative predicative phrase
takes on the structure /g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ NP-ã/̰ (not.have-gen NP-poss), as in (619).

In the following example, however, privative negation is unexpectedly expressed through the
combination of tãů ‘neg’ (in this particular case, its conservative variant tãů ʼü̃́) and ã̄ ‘have’, instead
of /g̃e-̊ /:

but involves dynamicity and control of the subject argument (and could in fact be glossed as ‘take

"7.6Pro-sentential negationThere is no morpheme specialized in pro-sentential negation in smat. Negative
pro-sentences result from the mere ellipsis of any other constituent than the
negative word from what their equivalent full negative clause would be (although
that negative word’s clitics and/or mārǖ ‘prf’ often remain, if present, as in the
first half of example (644)). Thus, (644) can be interpreted as being based on a full

clause such as /Tãu

based on a full clause such as Tãů ʼü̃́ [/chā=/ti ́mido.] ‘[I’m] not [tímido.]’. Example
(646) starts with the realization of a full clause, and then proceeds to “repeating”
that same clause by means of tågù ‘never’ used as a pro-sentential negation marker.

However, where a specialized negative word (e.g. tåʼu ‘be absent’, /g̃e-̊ / ‘not
have’, tåʼúgù ‘never’, etc.) would be regularly expected in a full negative clause,
̊ ‘neg’ (or its variant tãu
̊ ʼü̃́) can work as a universal pro-sentential negation
tãu
marker, much like English ‘no!’. Thus, in example (647) (repeated from (635)
above, although with a more literal translation), while in fact privative negation
is involved (which could have triggered the use of the specialized privative verb
/g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ in the pro-sentential part of the speaker’s answer), the less specific
negation marker tãů ‘neg’ is used instead of /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ (here under its irregular
̊ =mā/ ‘neg-precisely’; see Section 7.5 above):
combinatorial variant tåmā, for /tãu

Note that when the remaining negative word is tãů ‘neg’, it may indeed be re̊ ʼü̃́
alized as tãů , but it also frequently occurs under its conservative variant tãu
(while this variant is marginal in full clauses; see Section 7.2.1 above), as in examples (644–645). By contrast, it does not seem to be able to occur under its innovative
denasalized variant tåu. This phonological conservatism of the pro-sentential use
5377. Negation
of tãů ‘neg’, as compared to its ordinary clausal use, is likely due to the fact that tãů
‘neg’ is normally left unstressed in the latter use, while it obligatorily bears stress
in the former.
In answers to interro-negative questions (e.g. ‘Don’t you like it?’), pro-sentential negation is pragmatically used for confirmation by the speaker of the assumption of the addressee (‘No, [I don’t like it indeed.]’), as shown in the following example:
(648)[Tãů tàã̄ k[i ̄]-pà?]—Tãů ʼü!̃́
tãů =tàã̄̊ ʼü̃́
tãuk[i ̄]=pàneg=itself 2sg.sbj.pci ̄=be.tired neg‘[(Denis Bertet:) Aren’t you tired yet?]—No [I’m not]!’ [jsg A403]7.7Negative imperativeNegation cannot co-occur with a predicative phrase in the Imperative Inflectional Type (on which see Section 5.4). The negative imperative construction used
to express prohibitives, whether with a singular or a plural second person subject,
seems to be based on the negation focus construction described in Section 7.5
above (focalized.negative.word (inflected.copula) (lk=)clause.in.sbjvsub). By contrast to the negation focus construction, however, the prohibitive construction does not seem to ever involve the use of the inflected copula, and it often—
although not obligatorily—includes an additional specialized prohibitive second
position enclitic /=tā/ ‘proh’ (focalized.negative.word=proh (lk=)
clause.in.sbjv-sub).309 My corpus and elicitation notes only contain cases of prohibitives involving the negative word tãů ‘neg’, such as the following:
(649)Tãů (tā) (i ̀) “nôʼe̋” ña̋kùʼü̃́ tüʼ̂ ü!̃̄
̊ (=tā)

(650)Tãů tā ì pē-chókùgüʼ̋ ü!̃́According to ear, using the (optional) linker in the prohibitive construction imparts extra
directive strength to the prohibition and may make it sound more threatening.

However, it is possible that the prohibitive construction may also take existential
negative indefinites (see Section 7.3 above) in its position for focalized negative
words (with meanings such as ‘Don’t touch anything!’ or ‘Never tell them about
it!’).3107.8Negation and coordinationNegative polarity and coordination do not display any specific interaction.
Negation and coordination in the expression of groups such as ‘X and not Y’, ‘not
X and Y’, or ‘not X and not/nor Y’ (with X and Y being either arguments or whole
clauses) are thus encoded separately by their ordinary dedicated markers. The
following example illustrates the coordination of two negative clauses (of the type
‘not X and not/nor Y’), which is ordinarily done by means of the general coordination marker rǜ ‘and’:
(651)Ṵ̈ kü̋ tãů pūrākǘ i ̀ yâʼü̃́ níì-ĩ ̊ rǜ <tãů …> tãů nágù tá chàgǜ chīì-ma̰ʼüc̋ hì.","[541, 542, 543, 544]"
"In the following elicited example, however, a positive existential indefinite (g̃eʼ̀ ta̋
‘where?.aloc’) co-occurs with tãů ‘neg’ within a single negative clause:
310(i) Tãů tā g̃eʼ̀ ta̋ kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́

neg=proh where?.aloc 2sg.sbj\sbjv=go.sg\sbjv-sub
‘Don’t move from there [lit. ‘Don’t go anywhere!’]!’ [ear elic.]
It might thus be that negative polarity in prohibitive utterances always has to be marked by
tãů ‘neg’, regardless of whether existential indefinites are present in the clause or not—while in
declarative and interrogative utterances (see Section 7.5 above), these existential indefinites, if
present, would have been the regular locus for the encoding of negative polarity. However, it
might also be that the example cited above is a rarer and somewhat artificial alternative to an
expected (but unattested) ? Tåʼúwa̋ tā kù-ũʼ̂ ü!̃́ [lit. ‘Go nowhere!’], where negative polarity would be
encoded within the negative existential indefinite (tåʼúwa̋ ‘nowhere’) itself. The details of the smat
prohibitive construction will require more exploration.",[544]
"5397.9. Negation in interaction7.9Pragmatic uses of negation in interactionInterro-negative questions with /=tá/ ‘fut’, as in (654), or /=chi ́/ ‘irr’, as
in (655), are often pragmatically used for suggestion or invitation (‘Won’t you/
they …?’ = ‘I suggest you/they ….’; see also example (609) above):

̊ (or its variant tãu
̊ ʼü̃́) ‘neg’ in its pro-sentential function (see Section 7.6
Tãu
above) is regularly used pragmatically as a way to answer a content question in a
deliberately vague way, out of self-effacement (in which case tãů is often followed
by a more precise answer) or in order to elude a question (‘Well, nothing special,
(it’s just that …)’), as in the following example (repeated from (450)):312
(656)̃̀ īchā-fè rǜ nŭʼà chírḛ ī-g̃û rǜ

This pragmatic use of tãů ‘neg’ is likely related to the fact that tãů probably comes from tåʼúʼü̃́
(‘nothing’, among other possible glosses) etymologically (see Section 7.2.1 above).

‘“What are you looking for?” [she] asked. “Well, nothing special, I’ve shot
a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t find it.”’ [jsg
B220–222]
Rhetorical questions are often used to convey an emphatic negative exclamative meaning. In this discursive strategy, the referent asked about is implicitly
meant not to exist, or in other words an interrogative word is used instead of its
corresponding negative existential indefinite (as in e.g. ‘What did he do…?’ =
‘He did (absolutely) nothing!’). This is illustrated in examples (657–658) (see also
(T56)). Compare (657) with (622) for a parallel utterance featuring the corresponding explicitly negative construction. In (658), the corresponding negative sentence
is uttered immediately after the rhetorical question, yielding a binary discursive
structure interrogative.sentence+negative.sentence of relatively common
use in the language:

Interlinearized text: episodes from
the myth of Ngutapa as told by Loida
Ángel Ruiz
This appendix provides a fully interlinearized transcription of about two thirds of
a recording of the first few episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa and
his children as told by Loida Ángel Ruiz (lar, ♀, 49 y.o.). The corresponding
recording (recording C by lar in Table 1) was made on November 5, 2016 in
lar’s house in sma. This recording is 35’17” long altogether, of which the first
21’55” are transcribed in what follows. This entirely monological text is generally
representative of traditional Tikuna mythological storytelling. Note, however, that
I was the only hearer present during most of the performance, which is a highly
unusual speech setting for this kind of Tikuna verbal art.
The cycle of Ngutapa, his two sons Yoi (often called /tă-nátǖ/ (4-father) “our
father” by the Tikunas) and Ipi, and his two daughters is by all accounts (whether
endogenous or exogenous) the most important one in today’s Tikuna mythological repertoire, minimally among the Tikunas of Colombia. It contains, among
many other mythological accounts of elements characteristic of today’s world, an
account of the creation of human beings. For versions of the cycle of Ngutapa in
Western languages, see in particular Nimuendajú (1952:121–137; partly condensed
English version) and Goulard & Montes (2016; extensive Tikuna-Spanish version).
For a discussion of linguistic features typical of Tikuna mythological discourse, see
Gómez-Pulgarín (2012).
For parallel—although often divergent—versions of the episodes transcribed
below, see more specifically Nimuendajú (1952:121–123, 133–134) and Goulard
545& Montes (2016, episodes I–III). Note, importantly, that lar, the speaker of the
recording transcribed below, was part of the transcription and translation committee for Goulard & Montes (2016), which mostly consists in a written version of a
recording of the cycle of Ngutapa told in 1985 and 1988 by Humberto Chetanükü,
a renowned Tikuna storyteller from the upper Loretoyacu river. lar’s version of
the episodes below is therefore heavily influenced by Chetanükü’s version reported
in Goulard & Montes (2016).
An English summary of the episodes transcribed in this appendix is given first in
Section A.1. The fully interlinearized transcription of these episodes is provided
in Section A.2.
For another fully interlinearized smat text, see Bertet (2019).","[544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551]"
"The speaker jsg does not make a clear distinction between the feminine relativizer /-kǖ/ and
the masculine relativizer /-kǖ/, which are in practice only distinguished by their tonological effects

due to its phonological shape it would be interpreted by other speakers as referring to a masculine
referent, is meant by jsg to refer to a feminine referent (= /tåʼṵ-kǖ/ in other speakers), in this case
a tére̋ parrot (smat tére̋, which typically triggers feminine (f) agreement).

interpretations, as both may refer to any kind of entity whose denomination in
smat may agree with them in nominal class. In the following example, for instance, /tåʼű-ʼè/ ‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.s’ does not mean ‘nobody’, but simply agrees
in nominal class with its contextually implied referent, di ̄ẽr̄ ù ‘money’, a noun that
usually triggers agreement in the salientive (s) nominal class:

Note also that these negative existential indefinites, while they often function as
heads (‘nothing/nobody’), as in examples (620–621), may equally well function
as modifiers (‘no …’), as in (624), or headless modifiers (‘none’), as in (625),
just like any other relativization.

A second group of negative existential indefinites exists, which can be interpreted as partially lexicalized forms replacing tåʼúʼü̃́ in cases where it has a
very general meaning ‘nothing’. This group of negative existential indefinites is
morphologically built as combinations of /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’303 with a case suffix or a
relational noun. The ones attested in my data are listed in Table 51 (but note that
there is likely to be a few more than these, with other case suffixes or relational
nouns).304
By contrast to the previously discussed negative existential indefinites, which
can function as modifiers or modified heads, these /tåʼú/-based negative existential
indefinites always constitute entire arguments on their own, i.e. they may not
modify, nor be modified by, any other word. The following example illustrates
the ordinary use of one of them, /tåʼú-ʼǖ̃/ ‘be.absent\sbjv?-acc’:
This morpheme /tåʼú-/ ‘nothing’ probably comes from a former zero-derived nominalization of
the verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. Note, however, that by this etymological interpretation /tåʼú-/’s current
shape would appear to be tonologically slightly irregular, and one would have expected a form
*/tåʼu-/ (i.e. a form *[ˈt ̞aː34 ʔu 3 ...], featuring a tone [3 ], not [4 ], on its second surface syllable)
instead.
303Anderson & Anderson (2016:218-219) also register the related forms tax2 u2 ma3 ‘nothing’ (i.e.
/tåʼú=mā/ ‘nothing=precisely’ in my analysis), tax2 u2 cax5 ma3 ‘for nothing’ (i.e. /tåʼú-ka̰=mā/
‘nothing-cause=precisely’) and tax2 u2 cü2 rü2 wa1 ‘cannot’ (i.e. /tåʼú-kǘrǘwa̋/ ‘nothing-since?’) in
the Cushillococha Tikuna variety. These, and possibly more, might also exist in the smat variety.

As shown in example (626), some of these /tåʼú-/-based negative existential indefinites have a regular, compositional meaning (see also e.g. /tåʼú-máʼa/ ‘be.absent\
sbjv?-com’ meaning ‘with nothing, without anything’, as would be expected). Others, by contrast, have grammaticalized with less straightforwardly predictable
meanings, as suggested in Table 51. Illustrations of the latter cases are provided
in (627–629). Note that tåʼúgù (which only seems to mean ‘never’, while the relational noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ it contains would have lead to predict it to also be able to
mean *‘nowhere’) features, as in (627), a free variant tågù (probably a phonological
reduction from tåʼúgù itself; on the origin of the variant tågù, see also Section 7.5
and note 307 below). Note also that tåʼúak̃̀ ǜ ‘cannot, may not’ (lit. ‘no way’) is
not only used in the expression of physical inability, as in (629), but also more
general impossibility (see e.g. (T117)).

Note that any recording that contains at least some moments of interview-format
conversation is entitled “Interview” in Table 1. This does not imply that these
recordings only contain interview-format conversation. Most of them, in fact, contain moments that qualify as several of the categories of speech performances just
listed. The capital letters <A, B, C...> in the fourth column of Table 1 identify specific recordings in cases where my corpus contains several recordings by the same
speaker (see conventions for “Speaker and utterance references” on p.23). A sample
of excerpts from the recordings in Table 1 are available online at the following address: <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafhTQ1bTrPt6vohQgjEcAw>. An
extensive, fully-interlinearized transcription of the recording C by lar (“Myth
of Ngutapa”) is additionally provided in Appendix A of the present work.
The main shortcoming of my corpus in terms of variety of included discourse
genres is its lack of texts representing non-staged conversation. Despite considerable and repeated efforts, I was not able to record non-staged conversations with
a sufficient level of audio quality as to allow for their posterior transcription. The
steady ground noise in the environment, especially after dawn (insects, in particular) when speakers sit and relax after their day of work, is high in sma. Because
I only had a single head worn microphone at my disposal, at least one speaker
in a conversational setting had to be recorded with another type of microphone,
but it turned out that even recordings of conversations between no more than two
speakers with one of them being recorded with a shotgun (i.e. a highly directional)
microphone proved insufficiently audible to allow for an accurate and extensive
transcription of at least some parts of it. A cultural circumstance that further complicates the recording of conversations in smat is the fact that speakers engaged
in relaxed conversations with few participants have a strong tendency to talk in
a significantly lower voice than in e.g. Western European cultures. Exploitable
recordings of spontaneous or half-staged conversations in smat will require the
use of as many head worn microphones as conversation participants.
Of the 10 hours that make my corpus, note that only about 5 have been entirely transcribed and freely translated into Spanish with the systematic help
of one or several speakers. The transcription and translation of these 5 hours can
therefore be considered as highly reliable. The remaining 5 hours have not benefitted from such a systematic process of interpretation. For part of them, I only have a
systematically verified transcription, but no systematically verified translation, or
the other way around. I have been able to verify neither the transcription nor the
translation of another part of these remaining 5 hours, which I pre-transcribed by

myself over the course of the research project waiting for an opportunity to verify
them. A vast majority of the examples presented in this grammatical description
stem from the part of my corpus that I have been able to fully verify with
smat speakers. I only resorted to non-fully verified examples, or exceptionally to
unverified examples, in cases where a non-fully verified or unverified example provided a clear and uncontroversial instance of a phenomenon widely attested in the
verified part of the corpus. The main two reasons why I was not able to complete
the systematic verification of the whole corpus were 1) the irregular availability of
speakers, which did not allow me to work as much as I would have liked, and 2)
the complexity of the language’s tonological system, which for months could make
the correct transcription of a single syllable into a long and painful process.
Elicitation and systematic transcription and translation have been mostly conducted with dsg, ear, jgs, jsg, and lar, which undoubtedly entails unintentional
biases in this grammatical description towards the subdialectal variants employed by these speakers.11
The recordings that constitute my corpus were made for the most part using a
Zoom Q8 audio-video recorder and a Shure BETA 53 head worn microphone,
which proved an optimum combination of recording quality, ease of use, volume,
and weight. Using a head worn microphone, i.e. an admittedly relatively invasive
device, considerably improved the recording quality (by contrast with any device—
including highly directional microphones—placed at a greater distance from the
speaker’s mouth) without posing cultural issues at any point in the context of sma.
The recordings included a video whenever possible, which significantly enriched
their posterior analysis. Note that given the tonological complexity of the language,
The mother of dsg and jsg, two brothers who grew up in sma, was from the area of the Agua
Blanca river, a tributary of the upper Amacayacu river; their father was from the area of the Cotuhé
river, a minor tributary of the Putumayo river. ear and lar, two sisters, have lived most of their
lives in sma; their mother, gra, grew up mostly in Caballococha and the upper Loretoyacu river,
a minor tributary of the Amazon upriver from the mouth of the Amacayacu; I do not know the
geographic origins of their late father, Marcelino Ángel. jgs, finally, grew up mostly in Buenos
Aires and Caña Brava, two communities settled on the Cotuhé river, and definitively settled in sma
at the age of 16; I do not have clear data regarding the geographic origins of either of his parents.
Note, in any case, that the geographic origins of these speakers and their parents, although they
certainly account for most of the linguistic variation that occurs among them, obviously do not
account for all the characteristics of their idiolects. ear and lar, for instance, two sisters who have
lived most of their lives in the same area, diverge on the subdialectal variant of the conjunction náʼa
∼ ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ ‘conj’ they use, with ear using the former variant and lar the latter variant.
11441. Introduction
boring morphemes in order to be realized (excepting cases involving the consonant
/ʔ/). The correspondence between the shape of morphemes and their function (i.e.,
from the practical perspective of the analyst, the identification of morphemes) is
relatively straightforward in most domains of the morphological system of the language, except in the complex inflectional morphology of the finite predicative
phrase, due to extensive fusion, syncretism, and homophony between unrelated
morphemes in this domain.
smat nouns are morphologically distributed in independent nouns (stressed
free forms) and bound nouns (unstressed bound forms). The language features five
nominal classes. Agreement for nominal class, which manifests itself throughout
the nominal phrase and in the indexation of participants within the predicative
phrase, is obligatory. The assignment of participants to a given nominal class in
discourse, however, is flexible even within a single speech event and depends in
complex ways on lexical, semantic, and pragmatic criteria. Nominal phrases in
subject and object syntactic function are left unmarked (i.e. occur in the zerocase). By contrast, non-core syntactic functions are encoded, in most cases, by
means of a rich system of case-marking suffixes and relational nouns that are
attached to the nominal phrase. This tendency to dependent-marking coexists with
an opposite tendency to head-marking in cases where a nominal phrase comes after
(instead of before) the predicative phrase, in which case its syntactic function is
preferably marked through indexation within the predicative phrase (in cases where
indexes are available for participants in the corresponding syntactic function) and
the nominal phrase itself is left unmarked for syntactic function.
smat completely lacks a class of adjectives. Modification of nominal phrases
typically realized by means of adjectives in other languages is regularly realized
in smat by the subject relativization of stative predicative phrases. The language
does possess, by contrast, a reduced class of adverbs, whose single function is to
directly modify the predicative phrase.
Predicative phrases in smat can be verbal (i.e. based on a typically monosyllabic verb root) or non-verbal. Verb roots, which may receive inflectional
morphology of the finite predicative phrase as they stand, have access to a rich
paradigm of derivational suffixes most of which encode the nature of the spatial relation that holds between a figure (the subject or object participant) and a ground
at the culminating phase of the process. They also frequently incorporate nominal
constituents. Both verbal and non-verbal predicative phrases may additionally receive one or several of a number of derivational suffixes encoding categories such
as Aktionsart, aspect, mood, intensity, or number, among others. The intricate
501.5. Typological profile of San Martín de Amacayacu Tikuna
inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase provides slots for the
indexation of subject and object arguments, as well as that of participants in the
accusative (a syntactic function distinct from that of (core) object), benefactive,
locative, and partitive object syntactic functions. The inflection of the predicative
phrase additionally encodes predicative class (an ultimately lexical feature of predicative phrases, which are distributed in five predicative classes) and, optionally,
associated motion (i.e. the occurrence of a backgrounded motion event prior to
the main process). The encoding of tense is completely absent from the domain
of the predicative phrase. Tense is encoded instead within the nominal phrase
(“nominal tense”) or by means of clause-level enclitics.
smat can be broadly characterized as a nominative-accusative language. The
unique argument of intransitive predicative phrases (U) can indeed be said to align
with the agent argument of transitive predicative phrases (A, as opposed to its patient argument P) as far as the encoding of their syntactic function is concerned
(although this alignment can really only be observed in the indexation of these arguments within the predicative phrase, but not if these arguments are expressed
as syntactically free nominal phrases, in which case nothing allows to tell how U,
A, and P—which are all left unmarked—align). Note, however, that the effect of
certain derivational suffixes of the verb root or the predicative phrase follows an
ergative-absolutive alignment (e.g. the plural allomorph of some of these suffixes
encodes the plurality of U or P, but never A).
It is unclear whether an unmarked order of main constituents (or Basic Word
Order) can be detected in smat from a pragmatic perspective. Only the relative
ordering of the subject (S) and the object (O) is constrained in (rare) cases where
both of them are expressed as nominal phrases and occur before the predicative
phrase (V) (✓ SOV, not *OSV). Apart from *OSV, however, all possible orders occur
in apparently any type of clause (in slightly varying morphosyntactic structures)
without, in most cases, one of them being clearly identifiable as less marked than
the others pragmatically. From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, however,
the order S(O)V can be considered as the least marked insofar as it is the one that
requires the least morphosyntactic material.
A rich system of particles and clause-level enclitics encode notions of tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality, and polarity, among others.
Aspects of smat grammar that might currently be of particular interest to
typologists are the language’s rich tonological system (see Sections 2.4, 2.6.2,
and 2.7.3), its system of nominal classes characterized by obligatory agreement but
511.6. Organization of this grammatical description
coding of predicative—or “conjugation”—class; note that none of these functions
relates to tense, aspect, or mood). The functional distribution of the three Inflectional Types (Indicative, Imperative, and Subjunctive Inflectional Types), which
constitute the three values of the last inflectional category of the smat PP, is described next. The encoding of Inflectional Type does not possess a specific locus
within the inflectional template of the PP, but is expressed instead through the use
of one or the other of the three slightly different paradigms of morphemes that
are available in certain slots of the template. The chapter proceeds to give a detailed formal account of the inflectional morphology of the slots of the template
whose paradigms vary as a function of Inflectional Type, followed by an account
of the morphology of the slots whose paradigms remain identical across the three
Inflectional Types. It closes with functional discussions of two of the grammatical categories encoded in the inflection of the PP in smat (associated motion and
predicative class), and a discussion of the various strategies—inflectional or not—
by which the language may encode the number feature of participants from within
the PP.
Chapter 6 deals with the morphology and the functional distribution of the
smat deictic verb, whose meaning can be roughly glossed as ‘to do thus’. The deictic verb, although it inflects for the exact same categories as regular PPs, features
a unique, completely irregular inflectional paradigm, which is the main reason why
it is treated in a separate chapter.
Finally, Chapter 7 explores at length one aspect of the morphosyntax of the
clause in smat, specifically the expression of negative polarity.
This grammatical description additionally features three appendices.
Appendix A contains the contextualized and fully-interlinearized transcription
of a 22-minute long recording of episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa
and his children as told in smat by Loida Ángel Ruiz. The main chapters of this
work regularly refer to segments of this text, where grammatical phenomena under
discussion can be observed in a fully explicit discursive context.
Appendix B provides for reference an exhaustive glossary of the lexical morphemes mentioned anywhere in this grammatical description.
Finally, Appendix C summarizes in French the main findings of this study.
Note that an exhaustive index of the grammatical morphemes mentioned anywhere in this work is featured at the end of the volume.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

"6.2Inflectional morphology6.2.1Synchronic descriptionThe deictic verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ is inflectionally extremely irregular. Its complete paradigm is shown in Table 48 (contrast it with the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases shown in Charts A–M, pp. 449–
453).
Two forms, with a syllable in parentheses in Table 48, have alternative realizations in apparent free variation: /ngi ́-rǖgǜ/ ∼ /ngi ́-rǖrǖgǜ/ and /ña̋-tà[-ʼü̃́]/ (rare)
∼ /ña̋-tà-gǜ[-ʼǘ̃]/ (frequent). The latter pair of forms are occasionally truncated to
their first syllable, yielding ña̋, as in the following example:

The verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ only rarely occurs in ind and imp in
my data. The vast majority of its occurrences in my corpus are in sbjv/-ʼü̃́/,
presumably because it is mostly found in narratives with the typical sequencing
(i.e. [+ant]) effect of sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ (see Section 5.2.2). Occurrences of /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ in bare sbjv are rare, and all of them co-occur with a relativizer or the
clause-level inflectional morpheme /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’. This is why sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ forms (with
/-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ set apart in square brackets) are reported in Table 48 instead of bare
sbjv forms. There is no reason to believe, however, that standalone bare sbjv

required (see Section 5.2.5). Such standalone forms could of course turn out to be
slightly different from the ones tentatively suggested in Table 48 by the bracketing
out of /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ from the sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ forms.
Especially noteworthy is the fact that the subject indexes of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’, when present, are for the most part encoded by means of suffixes (/-chā/ ‘1sg.sbj’, /-kū/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which follow the stressed syllable of the
phonological word they belong to) instead of the functionally equivalent proclitics featured by the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases (/chā=/
‘1sg.sbj’, /kū=/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which precede the stressed syllable of the phonological word they belong to). Two inflectional forms of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ are even more exceptional: in /ngi ́-(rǖ)rǖgǜ/ ‘she does thus’ (ind) and /ngi ́[ʼǘ̃]/ ‘(that) she does thus’ (sbjv[/-ʼǘ̃/]), the exponent of the third person feminine
subject index, /ngi ́-/, is identical to the Allomorph 1 of the (stressed) pronominal
root /ngi ́-/ ‘3f’ (on the morphology of the pronominal roots, see Section 3.3.1).
Nowhere else in the inflectional paradigms of smat predicative phrases is the exponent of a subject index a stressed syllable, nor more specifically a personal root.293
Moreover, unlike regular predicative phrases, the deictic verb does not allow for
These two highly unexpected forms are unfortunately hard to interpret from a diachronic perspective. They could be analyzed as either inflectional fossils or late innovations.
2935126.2. Inflectional morphology
the indexation of arguments with any syntactic functions other than subject. It cannot receive the proclitics indexing arguments in accusative, in particular (on
these morphemes, see Section 5.7), although its valency does provide a position
for a syntactically explicit complement in accusative (see Section 6.1).
Another noteworthy morphological peculiarity of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/
‘do thus’, as discussed at the beginning of Section 6, is that it is best treated, from
a synchronic perspective, as a unique case of bipartite morpheme. This results
from the fact that its two separable morphological components, /ña̋-/ñâ-/ on the
one hand and /-((rǖ)gǜ)/ on the other—the latter being absent from certain inflectional forms—cannot be attributed separate functional contributions in today’s
smat and must consequently be considered to constitute a single functional unit.
Smat does not feature any other such bipartite morphemes.
Because the inflectional paradigm of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ is formally
so different from that of regular predicative phrases (and, among them, regular
verbs), the deictic “verb” could in strict logic be treated and labelled as a separate part of speech of its own, rather than as a verb. Note, however, that it inflects for the exact same categories as a regular predicative phrase (for Inflectional
Type in particular), and that it may receive at least a few derivational suffixes of
the (regular) predicative phrase (see Section 6.3). I call /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ a “verb”, in the broad sense, insofar as only verbs, among the regular predicative phrases with which it patterns, similarly consist in a functionally unanalyzable
lexical form.
The manner deictic word ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in this manner’, which occurs with both endophoric and exophoric uses (on these notions, see Section 6.1), is very likely to
have resulted historically from the combination of a bare sbjv form *ñâ ‘do.thus.
̀ ǜ/ ‘man’, with
3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv’ and the clause-level inflectional morpheme /-ãk
the literal meaning ‘in the manner of him/her/it doing like this’. Note however that
ñâak̃̀ ǜ has become unanalyzable and invariable in today’s smat, as shown in ex̀ ǜ/ (‘do.thus-1sg.sbj\sbjvample (597).294 In this example, a form like ? /ña̋-chà-ãk
man’) lit. ‘in the manner of me doing like this’ would have been expected otherwise, given that the subject of the main verb is a first person singular:This comment also applies to ñâak̃̀ ǜ in its frequent occurrences in association with the interrogative word ñùʼ(u) ‘what activity?’ yielding the invariable phrase ñùʼ(u) ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in what manner?
how?’ (on the interrogative word ñùʼ(u), see end of Section 6.1).

syllables with a labialized velar onset.
As shown in Table 9, the only systematic exception to this pattern of syllabic
harmony for surface nasality is the sequence [ŋV[–nasal] ] occurring in stressed
syllables. The following examples exhibit a [ŋ] occurring both—unsurprisingly—
in a nasal syllable (44b) and—unexpectedly—in a non-nasal syllable (44a):
(44)a. /oMC /b. /∼oMC/[ŋo̞o̰]̞[ŋõ̞o]̰̞̃‘be visible’‘to bite’This exception is not surprising if one analyzes this sequence underlyingly as /V/
and considers that its [ŋ] emerges secondarily as a default surface consonant onset
that fills its underlying lack of consonant onset (see end of Section 2.1.1).
Note also that the phoneme /ʔ/, whether in onset or coda position, is realized the same (i.e. as [ʔ]) in phonologically non-nasal and nasal syllables, as
shown in the following two examples:
(45)a. /ʔa22 /b. /∼ʔa22 /[ʔa22 ][ʔã22 ]‘to sing’‘mosquito’Because a glottal stop is, for articulatory reasons, unspecified for nasality, the fact
that the realization of /ʔ/ does not vary according to the phonological nasality fea872. Phonetics and phonology
ture of the syllable it belongs to is unsurprising and does not constitute an exception
to the general pattern of obligatory harmony for surface nasality.
Possibly the only genuinely irregular exception to the pattern of syllabic harmony for surface nasality in the language occurs in the particle used for standard negation, which is typically realized as [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ]30 (on the standard negative particle, see Section 7.2.1). The anomalous co-occurrence of a non-nasal
segment [t ̪] with a nasal diphthong [ã͡ʊ̃] within a single syllable in this highfrequency morpheme clearly results from its historical origin as a phonological reduction of /ta34 ʔu4 ∼ʔɯ4 / [ˈt ̪aː34 ʔu4 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] ‘nothing’ (this non-reduced form still exists
in the language, but exclusively with a function of negative existential indefinite,
i.e. not that of standard negator; see Section 7.3). The phonological nasality of
the last syllable of the original form /ta34 ʔu4 ∼ʔɯ4 / has been retained in today’s
phonologically-reduced monosyllabic form [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ34
̃ ], giving rise to an anomalous
case of a nasality-wise disharmonic syllable. Interestingly, certain speakers tend to
denasalize
[(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ] (whose exact phonological representation is unclear under the analysis
of nasality put forward in this section) to [(ˈ)t ̪a͡ʊ34 ], a phonologically unsurprising
reaction that results in the regularization of the phonetic and phonological forms of
the standard negator ([(ˈ)t ̪a͡ʊ34 ], by contrast with [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ], can be straightforwardly
represented phonologically as /tau34 / under the analysis of nasality put forward in
this section).
While all other segmental phonemes may occur in nasal syllables, the velar consonant phonemes /k/ and /g/ do not occur in nasal syllables.
The presence or absence of nasality in a given syllable is entirely determined
by the lexicon; there does not exist a single phonological or morphological process
in the language that ever affects this feature so as to turn a nasal syllable into a nonnasal one or vice versa.
Note that due to this, there is no language-internal way to tell whether it is a
[–voice] consonant phoneme (e.g. a /p/) or a [+voice] consonant phoneme (e.g.
a /b/) that underlies a given nasal consonant on the surface (e.g. an [m]). In
other words, there is no language-internal way to decide whether a syllable such as
Note, incidentally, that the surface nasality that occurs in the first syllable of the more conservative variant [(ˈ)t ̪ã͡ʊ̃34 ʔɯ̃ 4 ] of the standard negative particle is unproblematic as it can be accounted for as a case of anticipatory nasality spreading (on this purely phonetic phenomenon, see
Section 2.1.2, p.73).

speaking, one thus has to consider that the [±voice] feature of onset consonant
phonemes, while contrastive in non-nasal syllables, is neutralized in nasal
syllables, according to the pattern shown in Table 10. Consequently, the phoneme
underlying a nasal consonant on the surface is to be viewed as an archiphoneme
specified for place of articulation but unspecified for voicing.
In this section, I have transcribed the archiphonemes underlying nasal consonants on the surface with uppercase letters representing—arbitrarily—the [+voice]
member of the pair of phonemes corresponding to each place of articulation (e.g.
/B/ for the neutralization of /p/ and /b/, i.e. for a bilabial consonant phoneme
unspecified for voice; see examples (40c), (41c), (42c), and (43c) above). For simplicity’s sake, however, in the remainder of this study the phonemes underlying
nasal consonants on the surface are transcribed as though they were the [+voice]
member of the pair of phonemes corresponding to each place of articulation (e.g.
/b/ in nasal syllables stands for /B/). This practical decision is illustrated in example (46). It should not obliterate the cross-linguistically unusual situation displayed
by smat whereby the contrastive voicing feature of consonants becomes neutral-892.4. Toneme inventory

major phonetic exponent of 8 of these tonemic values is a pitch pattern, while that
of the last 2 is a phonation pattern (on phonation patterns as “tonemes”, see below).
The toneme inventory in stressed syllables is exemplified in detail in Section 2.4.1.
Two alternative analyses of the toneme inventory in stressed syllables, which
would have resulted in a reduction of that inventory to less than 10 underlying
units, are considered but argued against in Section 2.4.2.
Unstressed syllables feature one of only 6 different tonemic values. Again,
the major phonetic exponent of 5 of these tonemic values is a pitch pattern, while
that of the last one is a phonation pattern. The toneme inventory in stressed syllables is discussed in detail in Section 2.4.3. Note, incidentally, that two of the
tonemic values found in unstressed syllables (/4/1 / and /C /) in fact only occur in
post-tonic syllables, and not in pre-tonic syllables (on syllabic structure, see Section 2.5). However, because the remaining four tonemic values of unstressed syllables are phonologically and phonetically identical in pre- and post-tonic syllables,
these two syllable types are dealt with together as far as their tonological properties
912. Phonetics and phonology
are concerned.
The phonetic realization of all the tonemes identified in Sections 2.4.1 and
2.4.3 is briefly illustrated on concrete samples in Section 2.4.4.
smat’s unusually rich toneme inventory, together with its maximal “syntagmatic toneme density” (i.e. the fact that all of its underlying syllables are tonologically specified), is assessed from a cross-linguistic and an areal perspective in
Sections 2.4.5 and 2.4.6 respectively.
Relatively complex morphosyntactically-conditioned processes of tonological alternations, which may secondarily affect a syllable’s lexical toneme, are
discussed in Section 2.6.2 further below.
Note, importantly, that I indiscriminately call “tonemes” suprasegmental
phonological items whose major phonetic exponent is a tone (tonemes proper,
with pitch-related contrastive properties) and suprasegmental phonological items
whose major phonetic exponent is a phonation pattern (which could be called
“phonationemes”, with phonation-related contrastive properties). For instance, I
call “tonemes” both a phonological item typically realized as a pitch contour starting from the tonal height [5 ] and falling to the tonal height [2 ] (i.e. toneme /52 /, as
in example (47a)) and a phonological item typically realized as a phonation contour starting with modal voice and ending with creaky voice (i.e. “toneme” /MC /,
as in (47b)).
(47)a. /wi 52 /b. /guMC/[wi 52 ]
[guṵ]‘to cut’‘to finish’The reason why I treat both types of phonological items identically, although
they exhibit heterogeneous phonetic exponents, is because they do not constitute
two orthogonal features but belong instead within a single functionally-homogeneous phonological paradigm in smat. Pitch has no phonological relevance
in syllables that involve creaky voice phonation; no pair of such syllables consistently contrast for pitch properties under any conditions.32 Conversely, phonation
is but marginally relevant—only to the extent that it is not creaky-voiced—in syllables where pitch is the foreground contrastive feature; in these syllables, phonation
In practice, modal-voiced portions of syllables featuring creaky voice are typically realized with
a pitch approximately corresponding to the tonal height that I transcribe as [2 ], but this is not always
the case.

is regularly modal. In other words, the phonological items that involve creaky
voice phonation (i.e. /CM /, /MC /, and /C /; see below) and those that rely on pitchrelated exponents (the tonemes proper) stand in absolute complementary distribution. Since the phonational-tonological paradigm they constitute features more
tonemes proper (8 in stressed syllables, 5 in unstressed syllables) than “phonationemes” (2 in stressed syllables, 1 in unstressed syllables), I have opted for designating both types after the usual term for the former.
On surface phenomena involving stiff voice and breathy voice phonation, see
Section 2.1.1 on the realization of /ʔ/ and end of Section 2.1.2 respectively.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. Apart from main clauses, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is found in
two major kinds of dependent clauses:
– it is obligatory in adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ (‘it being the case
that …’), /…-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’ (‘in order to …’), and ēka̰/ka̰ … ‘so that …’ (or
‘while …’);
– it is obligatory in complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’.
4225.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
The frequent and semantically vague adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ are roughly comparable to English gerundive clauses, hence the possibility of generally glossing them as ‘it being the case that …’. They may take a wide
array of circumstantial meanings and are often ambiguous. Their exact interpretation relies heavily on the linguistic and extra-linguistic context. Common possible
translations of these adverbial clauses in English include ‘when …, once …, while
…, as …, because …, although …’. These clauses may also occasionally bear no
clear semantic or discursive relation to their context (as in e.g. (T155)). The use
of the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ to introduce them is not optional. The following two examples illustrate this type of adverbial clauses featuring predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́:

conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’. Note that in rare occasions, clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
may be used to express reason (‘because …’) rather than purpose.

Among younger speakers (e.g. jsg, igv), such clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
are also
frequently used as mere complement clauses of predicates involving volitive
modality (i.e. predicates with meanings such as ‘to want to …’, ‘to invite to …’, ‘to
tell to …’, ‘to ask to …’, etc.), as shown in example (492).

In this context, however, clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
seem to be an emerging and still
rarer alternative for the regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ discussed
further in this section (or, in specific cases, for the command complement clauses
in rǜ … ‘and’, on which see Section 5.2.5 above).
Sbjv-ʼü̃́ is also of systematic use in the semantically vague adverbial clauses
in ēka̰/ka̰ … ‘so that …, while …’, as illustrated in the following example:
(493)̃́
“Pà mā, pà mā, kū-tṵ̈kǘ ka̰ kūī-déʼàèchāʼü?”

Regular complement clauses consist in a clause that is introduced by the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ and includes a predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́ (on rare
4245.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
complement clauses including a predicative phrase in bare sbjv, see Section 5.2.5;
on complement clauses of volitive predicates optionally marked with the relational
noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘caus’, see above in the present section). Such complement clauses
may function syntactically as either subjects (as in example (494)), (core) objects,
or any non-core participant required by the valency of the predicative phrase (as
in (495)).

The exact syntactic role of regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ is
sometimes unclear, as in (496), where a complement clause functions as a syntactically indeterminate complement of the intransitive phasal verb ũĉ hi ̀gǜ ‘continue’
(/ũ̂-chi ̀gǜ/ [go.sg-distr.sg] lit. ‘go gradually’):

Regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may also be topicalized and thus
occur in extra-syntactic position. In this specific case, the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ is frequently dropped, as in the following example:
4255. Inflection of the predicative phrase

As shown in examples (494–496), complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’
that are syntactically integrated in a matrix clause regularly follow the predicative
phrase of that matrix clause. Most of the time, an expletive cataphoric third
person non-salientive pronominal form (whether a free pronominal form, or
an index occurring within the predicative phrase as in (494–495)) precedes, or
is included in, the predicative phrase of the matrix clause and fills the syntactic
position of the complement clause (compare English ‘it is true that …’, ‘it is hard
to ...’).
Complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may complement an extremely diverse range of predicative phrases involving notions such as utterance (‘say that …,
ask what …, etc.’), cognition (‘know that …, think that …, etc.’), perception (‘see
that …, hear that …, etc.’), emotion (‘be afraid to …, enjoy doing, etc.’), volitive
modality (‘want to …, order to …, etc.’), or phasal aspect (‘continue to …, finish
doing, etc.’), among others.
(iii) Uses not related to clause type. Clauses in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are involved as
components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing
constituents other than subject and (core) object arguments (on the strategy applied for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments, see Section 5.2.5 above).
Constituents with any syntactic function (e.g. comitative in example (498), punctual locative in (499), manner in (491) above) and of any syntactic complexity
(whether a simplex or complex NP as in (498–499) or a full dependent clause as in
(500), repeated from (426 above)) may be focalized via this strategy.

This focalization strategy, apart from its regular and expected use for information structure management, is involved in a non-optional, essentially grammaticalized way in the second person prohibitive construction, which probably comes
historically from a focalization construction exerting focus on the negative particle
tãů ‘neg’. This construction is illustrated in the following example:

shown in (498–500) above. On the second person prohibitive construction, see
Section 7.7.
As was mentioned at the end of Section 5.2.5 above, the focalization of interrogative constituents in any syntactic function is optional but frequent in content
interrogative utterances, as shown in example (502) (see also (485) above). In
practice, interrogative utterances featuring such focalization of the interrogative
constituent do not seem to contrast in any significant way from corresponding utterances that do not feature focalization, as in (459) above.

52This study is a typologically-informed description of a few major aspects of the
grammar of a variety of Tikuna, a language isolate spoken in western Amazonia
along the banks of the Amazon river. The Tikuna variety described in this work
is that of San Martín de Amacayacu, a community located near the southeastern
tip of Colombia. Its speakers typically refer to it as tăgà, lit. ‘our (incl.) language’
or ‘people’s language’, even when talking to foreigners. The grammatical topics
covered primarily include the phonological system of the language as well as the
morphosyntax and semantics of its predicative phrase. Additional grammatical
domains treated in less detail include aspects of the nominal phrase and the expression of negation. All the analyses I put forward in this description are based
on first-hand linguistic data that I have collected between 2015 and 2018 in San
Martín de Amacayacu with the help of native speakers of the language.
This chapter introduces the language that is the subject matter of the present
311.2. Field site and fieldwork
nal labor parties which any household can organize to ask for the help of other
inhabitants in exchange for food and drink (manioc beer5 in particular; see picture
in Figure 9 at the end of this chapter) and future favors. Civil service (education,
health services, national park within which sma is located, etc.) and tourism, a
rapidly growing activity,6 provide a crucial monetary income for a number of
households. A few families additionally hold small convenience food stores.
Most people in sma identify themselves as Roman Catholics, and a few as
Evangelical Protestants. All, as far as I can tell, practice one or the other religion in
strong syncretism with traditional native beliefs. The native notion that every
individual belongs, like their father, to one or the other of the two Tikuna clanic
moieties (moiety of the winged clans vs moiety of the non-winged clans), in particular, and that marrying within one’s own clanic moiety amounts to committing an
incest, remain predominant.
As of 2018, most households possessed at least one boat and one gas boat engine.
A communal power station provided electricity to the whole village about 8
hours a day. A number of households possessed one or several electric appliances,
mostly freezers, fridges, or televisions. Most adults and youths, to the exception of
the elders, had a personal or shared cell phone, although the cellular and Internet
network coverage in the village was generally very poor. A state-run local digital
technology center7 offered Internet access on most weekday evenings for a very
affordable price, a service that was mostly made use of by the youths. The village
had no water distribution system. The Amacayacu river and its minor tributaries,
as well as collected rainwater, were the main water supplies available.
Sma is an ethnically very homogeneous community, with a vast majority
of its residents being ethnic Tikunas, and only a few being non-Tikuna indigenous
people or people who do not identify themselves as indigenous. Most adults, to the
exception of the non-Tikuna residents essentially, are fully proficient in sma Tikuna,
which they have as their mother tongue. Most of these sma-Tikuna-speaking adults,
to the exception of those above age 60, are simultaneously proficient—to varying
degrees—in Spanish, their second language. sma Tikuna and Spanish stand in a
diglossic relationship in the community, with sma Tikuna being used, in a major5Sp. masato.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]"
"4115. Inflection of the predicative phrase5.2.3Indicative Inflectional Type (ind) out of
declarative main clauses(i) Uses in non-declarative main clauses. In non-declarative main
clauses, ind may be used with one of three different functions (on ind in declarative
main clauses, see the preceding section):
– it is found in polar interrogative utterances (in apparent free variation with
sbjv-ʼü̃́, see Section 5.2.6 below);
– it is regularly found in content interrogative utterances;
– it is commonly found in constructional association with ngi ̏ʼā ‘let’s go’ in (positive) exhortative utterances with a 4th person subject (bare sbjv is also
occasionally found in this context, see Section 5.2.5 below).
As shown in examples (458) and (459), ind occurs in interrogative utterances,
whether polar questions (as in (458)) or content questions (as in (459)). I have
not been able to detect any significant semantic or pragmatic distribution between
the use of ind and the equally frequent use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar interrogative utterances.

The following example illustrates the regular use of ind in association with ngi ̏ʼā
‘let’s go’ in an exhortative utterance with a 4th person subject:

‘“Let’s sing!”’ [jsg B332]
(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. The use of ind is systematic in explicative
dependent clauses in ērǘ ‘because’ or ye̊rǘ ‘because.pst’. This use is illustrated
in the following example:
(461)Heike gá tà-tåʼúʼü̃́ ye̊rǘ Leticiawa̋ tá-ṹ […].

in main clauses for the expression of second person singular positive imperatives, as in the following two examples (see also (448b) above):
(462)Nűà nà-ũ!́nű-ànà=ṹprox.aloc-exo pcø.imp=go.sg‘Come (sg.) here!’ [amb 201]

different functions:
– encoding of a general positive directive meaning;
4135. Inflection of the predicative phrase
– expression of assertion (in combination with the morphemes /=na̋/ ‘assert’
or ta̋ ‘assert.expl’).
The directive meaning of bare sbjv in main clauses is compatible with any
person value of the subject. It is found with first and fourth person subjects with
an exhortative meaning (as in examples (464–465)), with second person subjects
with an imperative meaning (as in (466)), and with third person subjects with a
jussive meaning (as in (467)).

[lar A34–36]
4145.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
Of these associations, the one involving bare sbjv and second person plural
subjects (as in (466)) is probably the most common, given that it is apparently
the regular way to express a second person plural positive imperative. Bare sbjv
in main clauses seems to be much less likely to occur with subjects in other personnumber-nominal class combinations (as in (464–465) and (467)), at least in younger
speakers, who in such contexts typically replace bare sbjv with ind (case of a fourth
person subject, see Section 5.2.3 above) or with sbjv-ʼü̃́ in its deontic function
(case of a first or third person subject, see Section 5.2.6 below; see example (467)
for a case of vacillation between the use of bare sbjv and sbjv-ʼü̃́ for the expression
of a jussive meaning).
A rare use of bare sbjv in main clauses, which is likely derived from its general
directive meaning, is found in the expression of wishes and curses, as in examples
(468–469). These interpretations of bare sbjv likely rely on the constructional cooccurrence of other markers associated to them, such as ñȍʼkǜ ‘soon; if only …’ (in
wishes) or /tá=tà/ ‘fut?=add?’ (in curses).

Bare sbjv is also used in the expression of assertion, i.e. the expression of information that the speaker thinks does not, or may not, match with the assumptions
of the addressee or a third party (‘you know, …’, ‘this might not be what you/they
think, but …’). With this function, bare sbjv obligatorily co-occurs with the second position clitic /=na̋/ ‘assert’, as in example (470),263 or the utterance-initial
particle ta̋ ‘assert.expl’, as in (471). These two assertion markers have slightly

(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. Apart from main clauses, bare sbjv is found
in two major kinds of dependent clauses:
– it is regularly found in circumstantial adverbial clauses in /...-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’
(‘when/if ...’), /...-ya̽ne̋/ ‘simult.circ’ (‘while ...’), rǜ … ‘and’ (‘while ...’),264

as in the following example:

– it is found in the rare polar interrogative complement clauses in na̋ …

The various uses of bare sbjv in circumstantial adverbial clauses are illustrated in examples (472–477). The use of bare sbjv in association with /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’
in its temporal meaning ‘when ...’ is exemplified in example (472). Its use with
/-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’ in its hypothetical meaning ‘if ...’ is exemplified in (473). Its use with
/-ya̽ne̋/ ‘simult.circ’ (‘while ...’) is exemplified in (474). Its use with rǜ … ‘and’
(‘while ...’) is exemplified in (475). Its use with /ñṵmá=tà/ ‘present.time=add’
̀ ǜ/ ‘man’ (‘in this or
(‘until ...’) is exemplified in (476). Finally, its use with /-ãk
that manner’) is exemplified in (477).

their correct interpretation, the following example from my corpus features a case
of bare sbjv circumstantial adverbial clause with no other marking than the
use of bare sbjv itself:

[lar T85]
ear, with whom I transcribed the text from which this utterance was extracted,
confirmed to me that it was perfectly acceptable as it stands, although the same
meaning could have been alternatively expressed with a rǜ + bare sbjv (‘while
…’) dependent clause. It thus seems that bare sbjv can function on its own as an
Inflectional Type specialized in the expression of circumstantial adverbial clauses.
Examples (479) and (480) illustrate the use of bare sbjv in polar interrogative and command complement clauses respectively. These two examples were
elicited. My corpus does not contain any instances of these rare, but apparently
natural-sounding, constructions.

(iii) Uses not related to clause type. The use of bare sbjv is obligatory in
relative clauses. The predicative phrase in bare sbjv then bears the relativizer suffix, which agrees in nominal class with the pivot (featuring the forms /-kǖ/ ‘rel.f’,
/-kǖ/ ‘rel.m’, /-(ʼǘ̃)nè/ ‘rel.n’, /-ʼè/ ‘rel.s’, and /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘rel.ns’), as illustrated in
the following examples:

Relative clauses are involved as components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments (on
the strategy employed for focalizing other constituents, see Section 5.2.6 below).
Example (484), in which the subject âi ‘wild felid’ is focalized, is to be compared
with the semantically equivalent plain sentence /Âi pē=tàʼkú-ē-ʼẽʼ́ e./ (wild.felid
2pl.acc=be.an.orphan-intr.pl-caus) ‘A jaguar has orphaned you.’.

Focalization of interrogative constituents in any syntactic function is optional
but frequent in content interrogative utterances, as shown in example (485) (see
also (502) and end of Section 5.2.6 below). In practice, interrogative utterances
featuring such focalization of the interrogative constituent do not seem to contrast
in any significant way from corresponding utterances featuring no focalization, as
in e.g. (459) above.

Bare sbjv is also obligatory in subordinate clauses in /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’. Because
subordinate clauses in /-ʼǘ̃/ are extremely frequent and occur in a wide array of
contexts—including in main clauses via insubordination—the uses of bare sbjv in
association with /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ are treated separately, in Section 5.2.2 above (uses in
declarative main clauses) and in the next section (other uses).","[416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426]"
"5.7.1Indexes for benefactive-malefactive and
accusative participants (slots 1–2)The benefactive(-malefactive) and accusative indexes in slots 1 and 2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase (see Table 39, p.393) stand pronominally for participants which, if they were expressed as full NPs, would bear
the benefactive and accusative case-marking suffixes /-(ã)̀ ʼü̃̋/ and /-ʼü̃̄/, respectively. Compare, for instance, example (506), where the participant referring
to the recipient of a payment, being expressed as a NP, receives the benefactive
suffix /-ʼü̃̋/ (/maestro-ʼü̃̋/ [expert-ben] ‘to a professional’), with (507), where the
recipient participant is encoded as a mere pronominal index procliticized to the

Restoring an independent pronoun instead of a benefactive or accusative index
may occur as a strategy allowing for the insertion of an enclitic (especially
one that typically behaves as a second-position clitic) between the pronoun and
the predicative phrase. In the following example, the future enclitic /=tá/, which
usually behaves as a second-position clitic, is inserted right after the expression of a
second person singular accusative participant by means of an independent pronoun
(/kû-ʼü̃̄/ ‘2sg-acc’), and in front of the predicative phrase:
(509)̆ güʼ̋ ü!”
̃́
“Ñṵmá tá i ̀, kûʼü̃̄ tá chà-üá

chà=üápresent.time=fut=contr.top 2sg-acc=fut 1sg.sbj\sbjv=try\sbjv-sub‘“Now I’m going to test you!”’ [jsg B114]
However, the restoration of an independent pronoun is not obligatory for enclitic insertion, and in practice remains infrequent (although it might have been
obligatory at a former stage of the language when independent pronouns in the
benefactive and the accusative were just starting to evolve into proclitics). Contrast example (509) above, where /=tá/ ‘fut’ intervenes between the expression
of the accusative participant and the predicative phrase, with the following example, where the same enclitic comes after the whole predicative phrase regardless of
the fact that the latter bears an accusative index (/nǖ=/ ‘3m/n/ns.acc’):

Using an independent pronoun in the accusative instead of an accusative index
seems to be obligatory in a single context, specifically when the corresponding
participant is a complement of the deictic verb. This morphologically irregular
verb is never procliticized with the accusative indexes (see Section 6.2.1). Thus,
the third person salientive independent pronoun in the accusative (/tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ ‘3s-acc’)
in the following example cannot be replaced by its corresponding index (a form
such as */tǖ=ñâ-ʼü̃́/ [3s.acc=do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-sub] for ‘he told him’ is
unattested in my data and in all likelihood ungrammatical):

him: [...]’ [jsg 134–135]
In cases where both a benefactive participant and an accusative participant
are to be referred to pronominally within the same clause, only the accusative
one may be encoded as an index procliticized to the predicative phrase. The benefactive one is then obligatorily expressed as an independent pronoun (for instances
of this situation, see examples (153), (T69), and (T70)). In other words, slots 1 and
2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase cannot be filled simultaneously. I treat them as separate slots, instead of considering that they belong to
a single paradigm of which only one element can be present within a given inflected
predicative phrase, because the benefactive and accusative series of indexes are not
interchangeable in the situation just discussed. That is, when both a benefactive
and an accusative participants are referred to pronominally within a single clause,
it is not possible to express first the accusative one as an independent pronoun and
next the benefactive one as an index. Benefactive and accusative pronominal markers have to occur in this order, with the consequence that only the benefactive one,
being more peripheral than the accusative one relative to the predicative phrase,
can be “expelled” out of the inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase when
needed.
The first person singular benefactive and accusative indexes display two interspeaker variants each, specifically /cha̋=∼chő=/ (ben) and /chā=∼chō=/
(acc). The /a/-variants /cha̋=/ and /chā=/ are logically (given the origin of the
benefactive and accusative indexes as phonological reductions of the independent
4575. Inflection of the predicative phrase
pronouns in the benefactive and the accusative) used by those speakers who use the
/a/-variant of the first person singular pronominal root in cases where it bears the
benefactive or accusative suffixes (/châ-ʼü̋̃/ ‘1sg-ben’, /châ-ʼǖ̃/ ‘1sg-acc’). Conversely, the /o/-variants /chő=/ and /chō=/ are used by those speakers who use
the /o/-variant of the first person singular pronominal root in combination with the
benefactive or accusative suffixes (/chô-ʼü̋̃/ ‘1sg-ben’, /chô-ʼǖ̃/ ‘1sg-acc’). On the
/a/ and /o/ variants of the first person singular pronominal root in combination
with the benefactive and accusative suffixes, see Section 3.3.4.
Note that morphological sequences involving an accusative index followed by
the areal locative index /i ̋=/ (on which see next section) are occasionally realized by some speakers exactly like the benefactive index in the corresponding
person, which can prove confusing to the analyst. Thus, the morphemes /kű=/
and /tü̋=/, in examples (512) and (513) respectively, do not encode a second person singular benefactive and a third person salientive benefactive participants (although they are homonymous with the corresponding benefactive indexes /kű=/
‘2sg.ben’ and /tü̋=/ ‘3s.ben’), but the sequence of a second person singular accusative and a third person salientive accusative participants followed by the areal
locative index /i ̋=/:

4585.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types5.7.2Third person indexes for locative and
partitive object participants (slot 3)Third person participants with a locative syntactic function may be indexed
on the predicative phrase by means of the proclitics /i ̋=/ (areal locative participant), /ne̋=/nű=/ (areal locative participant corresponding to the source of a
centripetal motion), and /i ̀=/ (punctual locative participant?) in slot 3 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase. These morphemes are discussed in
Section 5.7.2.1.
The encoding of third person (core) object participants that are only partitively affected by the process denoted by a transitive predicative phrase involve,
under certain conditions, the use of the proclitics /tà=/ (masculine partitive object), /ne̋=(/nű=?)/ (neuter partitive object), and /nè=/ (non-salientive partitive
object) in what I hypothesize to be the same morphosyntactic slot. These morphemes are the topic of Section 5.7.2.2.
The reasons why I tentatively analyze these two subsystems of locative participant indexation and partitive object participant indexation as belonging to the same
morphosyntactic slot are because 1) they never co-occur within the same inflected
predicative phrase in my data (negative evidence) and 2) they appear to share
one morpheme, specifically /ne̋=/ (and possibly its subdialectal variant /nű=/),
which is featured in both subsystems although with different functions (positive
but uncertain evidence). This question could probably be easily settled by further
research.","[459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"
"4.2.1Verb rootsI define verb roots as synchronically unanalyzable PPs, i.e. synchronically
unanalyzable lexical items that may as such—i.e. with no additional morphology—
receive regular inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase. According
to this criterion, the following lexical items can be identified as verb roots:
(283)a. ü̆‘to make’c. pū‘to rain’b. ñā‘to run (sg.)’2894. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
d. tá‘be big’f. yâtǜ
g. chüt̊ ā‘be a male’‘to get dark’i. pūrākǘ‘to work’e. tåʼū à
h. inü
̃̄ k‘be absent’‘to play’All verbs are stressed morphemes (and therefore always bear stress on their
first syllable). Although most verb roots are monosyllabic, as in (283a–283e),229
monosyllabicity is not an obligatory phonological property of verb roots, as evidenced by (283f–283i).
I tentatively analyze the morpheme /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ as a verb root, although
it does not satisfy the definition of verb roots above insofar as it cannot occur in
discourse without incorporating a bound noun or an NP. This stressed morpheme,
which functions as a counterpart in the negative polarity of the morphosyntactically
regular verb root ã̄ ‘to have, to give’ (see Section 7.2.3), does not quite fit in any
morpheme class of the language.
The morphologically exceptional deictic “verb root” /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ does not satisfy the definition of verb roots above either, as it cannot take
any of the regular inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase (on the
deictic verb, see Section 6). I call the deictic verb a “verb”, in the broad sense,
insofar as it may form on its own a well-formed predicative phrase which, like
verbs, consists in a functionally unanalyzable lexical form (for a discussion of the
identification of the deictic verb as a “verb”, see Section 6.2.1).
Conversely, a few synchronically unanalyzable morphemes that I treat as nonverbal do appear to satisfy, paradoxically, the definition of verb roots above, since
they may directly take regular inflectional morphology of the finite predicative
phrase as they stand. These are morphemes such as g̃eʼ̀ tà ‘where? (ploc)’, g̃aì kàmà
‘proximity (ploc)’, or yåʼü̃́ ‘remoteness (ploc)’. An instance of the latter occurring

[...] ērǘ nüwTåʼu ‘be absent’, although it surfaces as a disyllable ([ˈt ̪aː34 ʔu3 ]) under certain circumstances,

[amb 94–95]
These morphemes belong to the lexical class of circumstantial independent nouns
(i.e. a class of independent nouns that always or often occur without syntactic
function marking). When they occur as complements rather than in PP position,
they are specialized for uses in the punctual locative (ploc) syntactic function (although they do not—and probably cannot—bear the relational noun /-gu̽/, which
usually serves as a marker for that syntactic function). Rather than verbs, these
morphemes, when they occupy the function of PP, are in fact better considered as
nouns occurring in a particular configuration of the type of non-verbal predicative phrases that are made of an NP plus the predicative relational noun
/-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ (on this type of non-verbal PP, see Section 4.3.3.1). The configuration of /-gu̽/-non-verbal PP in which these nouns are then involved is particular
insofar as its ploc marking is exceptionally covert (being subsumed in the lexical
properties of the noun that constitutes the NP part of the /-gu̽/-non-verbal PP),
while that marking is usually overt in /-gu̽/-non-verbal PPs.","[294, 295, 296]"

However, in cases where a medial or distal non-salientive demonstrative serving

forms /ngē-ʼü̃̄/ (med.ns-acc) and /ye̊-ʼü̃̄/ (dist.ns-acc) on the other, may occur, with the latter forms being preferred, at least by older speakers. These forms
ngēʼü̃̄ and ye̊ʼü̃̄ are only attested with a discourse deictic function, referring to a previously mentioned activity. The medial ngēʼü̃̄ may occur in any context, as shown
in example (214) (see also (T18)), while the distal ye̊ʼü̃̄ only occurs, optionally, in
pre-hodiernal past contexts, as in (215) (see also (T93)).

hardly or plainly unanalyzable synchronically but are obviously composed diachronically of the non-salientive form of the medial or distal non-locative
demonstrative root (i.e. /ngē-/‘med.ns’ or /ye̊-/ ‘dist.ns’) plus a bound morpheme which in certain cases may still be identified with some degree of certainty.
These forms all exist under two inflectional forms, one, starting with /ngē-/, being a default form unspecified for nominal tense, and the other, starting with /ye̊-/,
2433. The nominal phrase
being a specialized form optionally used to make it explicit that the utterance it
is part of refers to pre-hodiernal past processes. The pre-hodiernal past form of
several of them, however, appears to be very uncommon in spontaneous speech, at
least in younger speakers.
While all of these forms are historically based on deictic roots, only two have
retained a clear deictic meaning, and more specifically a discourse deictic one,
by involving reference to a circumstance alluded to in the preceding discourse
́ a̋/ye̊ʼküŕ üw
́ a̋ ‘(in) those
(ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá ‘(at) that time; that way’ and ngēʼküŕ üw
days’). The other five ngē-/ye̊- words can be considered to no longer feature any
deictic meaning. In spite of their non-deictic nature, I briefly mention them in this
section on the smat demonstratives inasmuch as they are derived etymologically
from deictic words.
Three of the ngē-/ye̊- words are circumstantial independent nouns (respectively meaning ‘(at) that time; that way’, ‘(in) those days’, and ‘(in a) recent time’).
These are discussed first below. The remaining four are discourse connectors (‘because; but’, ‘and; so that, while’, ‘or better still (?)’, ‘according to it (?)’) and are
discussed next.
(i) Ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá ‘(at) that time; that way’.
In most of its occurrences,
this ngē-/ye̊- circumstantial independent noun refers to a relatively well circumscribed temporal setting commented upon in an immediately preceding
stretch of discourse. In the following example, ngēʼgùmá refers to a particular
moment of the speaker’s childhood that was the temporal background of events
that have been the main topic of the preceding stretches of discourse:
(216)Chàʼíka̋ níì-ĩ ̊ gá mā chà-yăʼü̃́ gá ngēʼgùmá.chà-ʼíka̋ níì=ĩ ̊

For temporal uses of this ngē-/ye̊- word in its pre-hodiernal past form ye̊ʼgúmá, see
example (305) above and (T31–T32).
Ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá also occasionally refers not to a temporal setting, but to the
way in which a previously mentioned process unfolds. In this meaning, it fre2443.4. Non-locative demonstratives
quently bears the suffix /-ʼrü̋ʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, usually acquiring the precise meaning of ‘in
a way similar to that’, as in the following example (see also (T80)):
(217)M̂mm, chòmà rǜ tà ngēʼgùmárüʼ̋ ü̃̀ chòmáʼa ná-gûʼchà.
m̂ mm chò-mà=rǜ=tà

‘Yeah, me too it’s hard for me like that way.’].’ [igv 601]
In the absence of /-ʼrü̋ʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá exactly means ‘by so doing, by
doing what was just referred to’ (i.e. literally ‘that way’), as in (T154).
Finally, ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá additionally occurs in a lexicalized form in the probably synchronically unanalyzable word /ngēʼgùmá(-)ré/ ‘that much, that many’,217
which refers to a quantity mentioned in preceding stretches of discourse. Example (218) provides an occurrence of ngēʼgùmáré. Note that in this particular
example, endophoric reference seems to be employed, rather unusually, as a summarizing device: the endophoric demonstrative ngēʼgùmáré apparently stands as a
generic quantifier that fills the syntactic position of the specific numeral that was
actually uttered in the original situation reenacted by the speaker in an abridged
fashion (as shown by the example’s translation, the English demonstratives this and
that can be used for the same pragmatic purposes).

318–319]
A pre-hodiernal past form *ye̊ʼgúmáré corresponding to ngēʼgùmáré is unattested in my data,
although it can reasonably be assumed to exist based on the existence of the pre-hodiernal past
form ye̊ʼgúmá corresponding to ngēʼgùmá ‘(at) that time; that way’.
2172453. The nominal phrase
Ngēʼgùmáré is obviously analyzable, from a diachronic perspective at least, as being
composed of ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá plus a bound morpheme */-ʼré/ ‘amount (?)’.218 The
fact that this quantity-specifying endophoric demonstrative is derived from a manner anaphoric demonstrative and therefore possibly literally means ‘the amount of
that way’ (see preceding paragraph) might reflect the fact that amounts used to be
conceived of by former speakers of the language (but most likely no longer are) as
concepts that are communicated by gestures, i.e. through a procedure, specifically
a way of moving one’s body.
The second and third syllables of the forms ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá are likely analyzable, from a diachronic perspective, as the locative relational noun /-gu̽/
‘ploc’219 and the suffix /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’, respectively, although it is unclear how
such a morphological association may have arisen historically.
́ a̋/ye̊ʼküŕ üw
́ a̋ ‘(in) those days’.
(ii) Ngēʼküŕ üw
This rare ngē-/ye̊- circumstantial independent noun is only attested in elicited data and might be somewhat
old-fashioned. It refers to a vaguely delimited temporal setting commented
upon in an immediately preceding stretch of discourse. The bound morpheme
/-ʼkǘrǘwa̋/ which obviously composes this ngē-/ye̊- word is also found in other more
easily analyzed forms referring to vague time periods (in particular, /nůʼkǘmákǘrǘwa̋/ (past.time-times?) ‘in the old days’ and /ñṵmá-kǘrǘwa̋/ (present.timetimes?) ‘these days’).
(iii) Ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà ‘(in a) recent time, recently’.
This ngē-/ye̊- word,
which I analyze as a circumstantial independent noun, refers to a past time that
is recent relative to the temporal setting of the processes being referred to. It
mostly functions as an adjunct, in which case it may be translated as ‘recently’
This bound morpheme is found in lexicalized form in the synchronically unanalyzable or hardly
analyzable words ñùʼré ‘how much? how many?’, nôʼré ‘be little, be few’, düʼ̀ ré ‘this much, this many
(demonstratively)’, and possibly tăʼré ‘two’ (</tă-ʼré/ [4-amount?] ‘the amount of you and I’?).
218Today’s suffix /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ probably used to have a pre-syllabic coda glottal stop, displaying a
form */- ʼ gu̽/ homonymous with the likely cognate circumstantial subordinator /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’. This
pre-syllabic glottal stop is exceptionally retained in the locative 2 form of certain monosyllabic
independent nouns, e.g. i ̃́ ʼ gù ‘in the house’ from i ̃́ ‘building’ and /-gu̽/ (rather than igù
̃́ , although
the latter form is also acceptable). This highly plausible hypothesis allows to compare today’s suffix
/-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ with the second syllable of ngēʼgùmá/ye̊ʼgúmá, to which the word’s glottal stop must
have belonged originally, since the demonstrative roots /ngē-/ and /ye̊-/ do not, for their part,
include a glottal stop in their lexical forms.
2192463. The nominal phrase
The corresponding pre-hodiernal past form ye̊ʼwa̰ is only attested in elicited data.
The distribution of ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà vs ngēʼwa̰/ye̊ʼwa̰ is unclear.
The second syllable of ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà and ngēʼwa̰/ye̊ʼwa̰ might be cognate
with the locative relational noun /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’.220
(iv) Ngē-/ye̊- discourse connectors.
At least four discourse connectors appear to be derived, diachronically, from the non-salientive forms of the medial or
distal non-locative demonstrative roots.
The very frequent discourse connector ngērü/́ ye̊rǘ typically translates to English ‘because’, although it may also mean ‘[not ...] but [instead ...]’ in specific
cases where it introduces a positive clause that serves as a correction of an immediately preceding negative clause (see Section 7.8). For occurrences of the default
form ngērǘ (under its more typical unstressed form ērǘ; see below), see example
(207) and (T18) and (T134), among many others. For occurrences of the specifically pre-hodiernal past form ye̊rǘ, see (T34) and (T44).
The frequent word ngēka̰ (or ēka̰; see below) may be used as a conjunction
that loosely coordinates two clauses. It then virtually always occurs under the
abridged and invariable form ka̰ and can be translated as ‘and, and then’, as in
example (182). It often involves a subtle contrast between the two clauses it coordinates, as in (208). Ngēka̰ may additionally be used as a conjunction that introduces
semantically vague adverbial clauses. It can then be roughly translated as ‘so that
...’ or ‘while ...’, as in (199), (T58), or (T106). For more on this construction, see
Section 5.2.6, p.424. The pre-hodiernal past form ye̊ka̰ corresponding to ngēka̰ is
only attested in elicited data. The second syllable of ngēka̰/ye̊ka̰ might be cognate
with the relational noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’.221
Today’s suffix /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’ probably used to have a pre-syllabic coda glottal stop, displaying a
form */- ʼ wa̋/. This pre-syllabic glottal stop is exceptionally retained in the locative 2 form of certain
monosyllabic independent nouns, e.g. i ̃́ ʼ wa̋ ‘to the house’ from i ̃́ ‘building’ and /-wa̋/ (besides
the—equally attested—expected form iwa̋
̃́ ). This highly plausible hypothesis allows to compare
today’s suffix /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’ with the second syllable of ngēʼwa̋kà/ye̊ʼwa̋kà and ngēʼwa̰/ye̊ʼwa̰, which
is the syllable to which these two words’ glottal stops must have belonged originally, since the
demonstrative roots /ngē-/ and /ye̊-/ do not, for their part, include a glottal stop in their lexical
forms.
220Possibly problematic for this hypothesis, however, is the fact that *ngē ʼ ka̰/ye̊ ʼ ka̰, with a glottal
stop, might then have been expected instead of ngēka̰/ye̊ka̰, since /- ʼ ka̰/ ‘cause’ features a glottal
stop.
2212483.4. Non-locative demonstratives
The discourse connector ngēnèka̋tǘ (or ēnèka̋tǘ; see below) is only attested once
in my corpus of spontaneous speech, in example (221), where it occurs under its
unstressed form ēnèka̋tǘ. It seems to be roughly translatable as ‘or even better’.
Its pre-hodiernal past form ye̊néka̋tǘ is only attested in elicited data.

Ngēwa̋ ‘according to it (?)’ (or ēwa̋ ; see below) is equally attested only once
in my corpus, in example (222), where it occurs under its unstressed form ēwa̋.
Its meaning is unclear and its analysis as a discourse connector is tentative and
provisional. Its pre-hodiernal past form ye̊wa̋ is only attested in elicited data.

It’s second syllable is likely cognate with that of the discourse connector ngi ̂wa̋
̂ a̋ (m/n/ns)/tüw
̂ a̋ (s) ‘well, as for it’, and possibly with the locative rela(f)/nüw
tional noun /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’.222
These four discourse connectors, although they may be realized as stressed
words, are virtually always left unstressed in spontaneous speech. As a consequence, the first syllable of their ngē- form is typically realized /ē-/, i.e. without
an initial velar nasal, yielding forms that are better transcribed as ērü,́ ēka̰ (or even
Note that the hypothesis put forward in note 220 (according to which /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’
may have formerly featured a pre-syllabic coda glottal stop, displaying the lexical form
*/- ʼ wa̋/), makes the hypothesis that the second syllable of ngēwa̋ (and, simultaneously, that of
̂ a̋/tüw
̂ a̋ ‘well’) might be cognate with /-wa̋/ ‘aloc’ relatively problematic, since *ngē ʼ wa̋
ngi ̂wa̋/nüw

just ka̰), ēnèka̋tü,́ and ēwa̋ respectively (on the phonetic and phonological effects of
de-stressing stressed words, see Section 2.5.1, p.121).
The conjunction ēgá (also /gá=/) ‘if’ can be realized as ngēgá and may therefore have been formerly another ngē-/ye̊- word. A hypothetical corresponding prehodiernal past form *ye̊gá is not attested in my data, however, and was explicitly
rejected in elicitation. The enclitic /=ēkà/, which generally expresses unsureness
of the speaker and is mostly employed in direct questions to make them more insistent, might also be a former ngē-/ye̊- word. Against this hypothesis, however,
are the fact that it does not seem to be realizable as *ngēkà and that a hypothetical
corresponding pre-hodiernal past form *ye̊kà is unattested in my data.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]"
"However, in the speech of most speakers, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is regularly used in declarative main clauses to present a process as constituting a new, salient step within
a temporal sequence of processes. sbjv-ʼü̃́ is then resorted to as a discursive device that allows the speaker to explicitly construct a clear temporal axis along which
major steps are grammatically signaled as such as they are being mentioned. Such
uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses could be roughly glossed by ‘at that
point, …’, as was done in the translation of example (448d) above. By contrast,
non-sequential processes, or minor sequential processes that the speaker does
not want to present as sequenced, are referred to with predicative phrases in ind.
In other words, predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ essentially correspond to those that
involve what I call advancement of narrative time ([+ant]), while predicative phrases in ind essentially correspond to those that do not involve advancement of narrative time ([-ant]). An important consequence is that predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses may not be uttered in a different
order without typically implying a different sequence for the processes referred to,
i.e. the ordering of [+ant] forms conditions the semantic interpretation of the
processes referred to. By contrast, predicative phrases in ind in declarative main
clauses may be uttered in a different order with no direct implication as to the sequence of the processes referred to, i.e. the ordering of [-ant] forms has no effect
on the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to. Note that the ordering of [-ant] forms does, by contrast, condition the discursive—more specifically,
the rhetorical—interpretation of utterances, as it obviously has direct effects on
the order in which the information is delivered and construed and the way it is
rhetorically organized.259Thus in example (451) below, which contains three main clauses in ind, the enacted speaker
chooses to first make a more generic announcement (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) and then proceeds to make a more specific elaboration on it in the next two utterances (‘I’ll shoot some brown
woolly monkeys. I’ll go woolly-monkey-hunting.’). With the exact same semantic meaning, the
first utterance (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) could presumably have been uttered last, but then that
semantically more generic utterance would have been construed as a summary restatement of the
more specific announcement made in the previous two utterances, yielding a different rhetorical
structure from the one actually at play in (451). Likewise, in (450) below, the ordering of the three
clauses in ind in the answer (‘I’ve shot a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t
find it.’) could in principle be altered (as in e.g. ‘A beautiful tére̋ parrot has fallen down here, but
I can’t find it, [in fact] I’ve shot it.’) with no consequences as to their semantic interpretation, but
2594005.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
Typical discourse genres where the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is exploited are
narratives (whether set in a remote past and unrelated to the discourse participants—myths, legends, tales, etc.—or set in a relatively recent past and related to
the discourse participants—life stories, anecdotes, etc.) and procedural discourse
(cooking recipes, descriptions of craft techniques, chronologically-ordered descriptions of the typical activities carried out in a given period of time, etc.). In these
discourse genres, while predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are used to orderly unroll the
series of major events (or steps to be conducted), predicative phrases in ind are generally employed with one or several of the following six main discursive functions
(the simple illustrative contexts of use in parentheses are made up examples that
parallel actual occurrences in my corpus; actual examples are provided below):260
– locating a major event in space or time (e.g. ‘The next day came.ind. Then
he went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ into the jungle.’);
– mentioning preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a
monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);
– recapitulating a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came down.sbjv-ʼü̃́.
So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);261
such alterations would affect the rhetorical relations that bind them into a small discourse unit.
In practice, in (450), the rhetorical principle that guides the ordering of the clauses in ind under
scrutiny is temporal iconicity, but the use of ind in these clauses indicates that establishing a clear
temporal axis is not essential to the purposes of the enacted speaker at that moment.
Interestingly, when they fulfill one of the first three functions in this list, main declarative
clauses containing a predicative phrase in ind are often explicitly topicalized by means of a topic
marker (/=i ̀/ ‘contr.top’ in non-past contexts or /=gá/ ‘pst’ in past contexts) attached at their
right edge (as in examples (454a) and (455e) below). This clause-level topicalization process could
in fact be argued to turn these clauses into near-dependent clauses (as opposed to genuinely independent main clauses). Note further that all of the six functions in this list are somehow related to
topical (i.e. already known or backgrounded) information, as opposed to the more focal (i.e. unknown or foregrounded) information typically conveyed by declarative main clauses containing a
predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́.
260The use of such recapitulating clauses for discourse cohesion is frequent in narratives and procedural discourse in smat. These recapitulating clauses are of two major formal and functional types.
Some include the predicative phrase of the recapitulated clause more or less verbatim (“recapitulating linkage” proper in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These verbatim (or specific) recapitulating
clauses typically provide linkage from one sentence to the next within a single paragraph and often
imply that the two main processes referred to are temporally close to each other (see e.g. examples (454a–454b) below). Other much more formulaic recapitulating clauses feature an anaphoric
word referring to the processes to be recapitulated (/ngē-mà/ ‘med.ns-anaph’ in past or non-past
2614015. Inflection of the predicative phrase
– initiating a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a man went.ind
into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’);
– elaborating on specific aspects of a major event occurring at the same reference time (e.g. ‘And then they had.sbjv-ʼü̃́ dinner. They chatted.ind, they
drank.ind [i.e. while eating]. Then they went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to bed.);
– describing participants of a major event (e.g. ‘The canoe was large.ind.’).","[405, 406, 407]"
"3.1.2Introduction to the inflectional category of
nominal classTwo major grammatical categories are expressed in the inflectional paradigms of
several of the elements of the NP listed above, specifically nominal class and nominal tense. The category of nominal class comprises five different values, which I
call the feminine (f), the masculine (m), the neuter (n), the salientive (s), and
the non-salientive (ns) nominal classes, respectively. Agreement for nominal
class is obligatory at the clausal level, i.e. any morpheme within a NP that can
inflect for nominal class obligatorily occurs in its inflectional form corresponding to
the nominal class of the participant referred to by the NP. Morphemes that inflect
for nominal class (i.e. targets of agreement for nominal class) essentially include a
few independent nouns (tò ‘other’, åkǘ ‘what? who?’, åküʼ́ ü̃́ ‘thingy (filler word)’,
g̃eʼ̀ ü̃́ ‘which?’, mentioned here—by convention—in their non-salientive form), the
third person pronominal roots, the non-locative demonstrative roots, the relativizer suffix, and the linker. The inflectional paradigms of most of these morphemes are described at length in the remainder of this chapter. The forms of tò,
åkǘ, åküʼ́ ü̃́, g̃eʼ̀ ü̃́, and the relativizer, which are not discussed in this grammatical
description, are displayed in Table 23 for reference (the neuter allomorph of the
relativizer has a default shape /-ʼnè/, but takes the disyllabic shape /-ʼü̃́nè/ when
attached to a monosyllabic verb root). Note that the morphological shape of independent nouns and bound nouns, for their part, does not bear—in most cases—any
relation with the nominal class to which participants expressed by means of these
nouns are assigned in discourse. Third person indexes on the predicative phrase
also obligatorily agree for nominal class with the participant they represent. These

37]
Although three of the labels I use to refer to the nominal classes of smat (‘feminine, masculine, neuter’) are borrowed from the terminology of the grammatical
category of gender (as it is attested in e.g. Romance or Germanic languages), it is
important to note that smat’s nominal classes differ significantly from what is
traditionally labeled genders in that the assignment of participants to nominal
classes in smat is comparatively much more flexible. This assignment relies not
only on lexical properties of nouns, but also, to a large extent, on semantic
and pragmatic criteria. In example (133) above, for instance, the deer is assigned
to the non-salientive nominal class despite the fact that the independent noun kŏwǘ
‘deer’ shows a lexical “preference” for the masculine nominal class. This assignment
of the deer to the non-salientive nominal class occurs for pragmatic reasons. In the
context of the utterance, the deer appears as a despicable being who is having a
bad influence on a woman. In accordance with the evaluative perspective of the
speaker, the deer is “demoted” from its lexical nominal class to the non-salientive
nominal class. This marked assignment (since it does not match the noun’s preferred nominal class) activates the evaluative value of the non-salientive nominal
class, which connotes that the referent does not deserve particular respect.195
On the complex principles that govern nominal class assignment in smat,
which are not covered in this grammatical description, see Bertet (to appear).
This kind of pragmatic effect of nominal class assignment in smat related to notions such as
familiarity or respect vs lack thereof is remotely comparable to the effect, in English, that arises
from referring to a boat with a feminine pronoun vs with a neuter pronoun, or to an animal with an
animate pronoun vs with a neuter pronoun.
1951873. The nominal phrase3.1.3Introduction to the inflectional category of
nominal tenseNominal tense is a grammatical category that is expressed in the inflectional
paradigms of the non-locative and locative endophoric demonstrative words
(see Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.3), the ngē-/ye̊- words (a small class of words that are
historically derived from the non-locative demonstrative roots; see Section 3.4.8),
and the linker (see Section 3.5.1). The category of nominal tense in smat has two
values, which can be labeled as [-past/unspecified] and [+past], respectively.
A distinction has to be made between older and younger speakers as to how these
two values are put to use.
In the speech of most older speakers (e.g. gra, lar), these two values are
essentially—although not always strictly—mutually exclusive ([±past] system).
Within clauses which refer to processes that took place in a pre-hodiernal past (i.e.
at a time that precedes the day of utterance time), the [+past] forms of the endophoric demonstratives, the ngē-/ye̊- words, and the linker are regularly used. By
contrast, within clauses which refer to processes that did not take place in a prehodiernal past (e.g. processes that occurred earlier today or that are presently occurring, prospective or future processes, generic processes, etc.), the [-past] forms
are used instead.
Contrast example (135), which refers to non-pre-hodiernal events, with (136),
an excerpt from a traditional story that refers to pre-hodiernal past events (in this
case, events situated in the remote past of traditional narratives). Both were uttered
by the same speaker, whose speech is representative of that of older speakers.

someone’s eyes’ sounds approximately like Õ̊nátǘ] the ones who had had
their eyes gouged out.’ [lar A74]
In the clause in (135), the ngē-/ye̊- word meaning ‘because’ occurs in its [-past]
form (ērǘ), while it takes its [+past] form (ye̊rǘ) in (136). Likewise, the linker
in (135) occurs in [-past] forms, including in its two occurrences in false starts
where the speaker inflects it in the wrong nominal class (<i ̀...> <yà...> yá). In
(136), by contrast, the linker occurs in [+past] forms (gá, twice). Finally, the nonlocative endophoric in (135) occurs in its [-past] form (yi ̂ʼèmá), while the locative
endophoric (ye̋mà) and the non-locative endophoric (gûʼèmá) that occur in (136)
feature [+past] forms (note that the [+past] forms of endophorics are based on the
distal demonstrative roots, by contrast with their [-past] forms, which are based on
the medial demonstrative roots; on the analogy between distance in space and distance in time that operates in the use of the demonstrative roots, see Section 3.4.1).
Younger speakers (e.g. jgs, jsg), for their part, have generalized the use of
the [-past] forms of the endophoric demonstratives and the ngē-/ye̊- words in
all contexts, whether non-pre-hodiernal past or pre-hodiernal past. In the grammatical system that underlies their speech, the [-past] forms of these words can be said
to be in practice unspecified for nominal tense, rather than [-past]. These speakers interpret the [+past] forms of these words, which they almost never use
themselves, as mere optional variants of the [-past] forms available in specifically
pre-hodiernal past contexts ([unspecified] vs [+past] system). However, younger
speakers do maintain a use of the forms of the linker that relatively consistently
expresses explicitly [-past] vs [+past] values. That is, although the category of
nominal tense has become obsolete in the endophoric demonstratives and the
ngē-/ye̊- words as used by these speakers, that category remains essentially
valid in their use of the linker.
1893. The nominal phrase
Contrast example (137) with (136) above. The utterance in (137), an excerpt
from a story told in the pre-hodiernal past, was produced by jsg, whose speech is
representative of that of younger speakers.
(137)[...] ērǘ tá-tâiyà gá yîʼèmá.
ērǘtá=tâiyàgá=yîʼè-mábecause(.[-pst]) 3s.sbj=be.hungry lk.pst=med.s(.[-pst])-anaph‘[Somebody brought them ripe plantains for them to cook for the monkey]
because it was hungry.’ [jsg C115]
Although the events being referred to are (fictitiously) situated in a pre-hodiernal
past, the speaker uses the [-past] (i.e., in practice for him, the [unspecified]) form
of the ngē-/ye̊- word meaning ‘because’ (ērǘ) and a [-past] form of the endophoric
demonstrative (yi ̂ʼèmá). In accordance with the temporal setting of the events, the
speaker does employ, however, a [+past] form of the linker (gá).
Nominal tense often gives rise to agreement-like phenomena (as in (135–136),
for instance, where entire clauses, and in particular entire NPs, feature only [-past]
or only [+past] forms). Although it is by nature expressed within the NP,196 nominal tense does not seem to be, however, a feature of NPs but a feature of
clauses. In this respect, it is not comparable with nominal class, in particular (on
which see the preceding section).
I have not delved into the semantics of nominal tense for this research. Note,
in any case, that it makes no doubt that nominal tense in smat is not an aspectual category (i.e. one that involves the encoding of a temporal relation that holds
between an event time and a reference time) but a tense category (i.e. one that
involves the encoding of a temporal relation that holds between a reference time
and utterance time). The [+past] forms of the words that inflect for nominal tense
in smat can never be used in contexts that refer to future events (i.e. that are posterior to utterance time), for instance. If nominal tense in smat were an aspectual
category, i.e. one that in principle bears no direct relation to utterance time, this
restriction would not be expected.
The grammatical category of tense in smat, apart from operating within NPs
through nominal tense, can also be encoded at the clausal level by means of the
Except, arguably, in the case of the ngē-/ye̊- words. Although all of them can be hypothesized to
have originated diachronically from nominal words, some of them, such as the discourse connector
ērü/́ ye̊rǘ ‘because’, are no longer nominal in today’s smat.

The index /i ̋=/ ‘3aloc’ may also stand for a dative participant referring to
the animate ground of a motion event (lit. ‘to/from her/him/them’), although
such occurrences are relatively rare. This mostly occurs in association with the verb
kà (pcØ), which in the absence of a dative participant means ‘to call (over)’ (i.e. to
request attention or a physical spontaneous motion on the part of an addressee
conceived of as a figure themselves), but in the presence of such a participant
means ‘to ask for (an information or an object)’ (i.e. to request the—metaphorical
or physical—caused motion of a figure away from an addressee conceived of as a
ground). Indexing a dative participant on this verb, in cases where it is intended
to mean ‘to ask for’ but where that dative participant is not expressed as a NP preceding the predicative phrase, is therefore crucial for its correct interpretation. The
4605.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types
dative participant in example (517a) is expressed as a NP that precedes the predicative phrase (in this case, an independent pronoun, /nü̂-ʼnà/ [3n/ns-dat] ‘from
him’). Consequently, the predicative phrase /tà=kă-ʼǘ̃/ (3s.sbj\sbjv=ask\sbjvsub) ‘he asked’ does not bear any indexation of a dative participant. In (517b), by
contrast, which immediately follows the utterance in (517a), the dative participant
is further backgrounded by no longer being expressed as a separate NP. As a consequence, the predicative phrase /i ̋=tá=kà/ (3aloc=3s.sbj=ask) ‘he asked’ must
index a dative participant by means of /i ̋=/. In the absence of any marking for a
dative participant, the utterance would be interpreted as ‘he called luck over (i.e.
to come to him)’ (for an instance of a construction involving kà in its meaning ‘to
call (over)’, see (234)).

The areal locative index /i ̋=/ ‘3aloc’ may further stand for a duration complement (lit. ‘for it’), although note that such complements, when expressed as
NPs, are not usually marked with the areal locative relational noun /-wa̋/ but left in
the zero-case instead (but see (T44) for an instance of such a complement—in this
case a relative clause—marked with /-wa̋/). In example (518), /i ̋=/ in the relative clause /nű-à i ̋=chī=pūrākü̋-ʼü̃́/ (prox.aloc-exo 3aloc=1sg.sbj.pci ̄.sbjv=
work\sbjv-sub), lit. ‘[the time] that I’ve been working here for it’, is a resumptive
index standing for the pivot, which serves as a duration complement within the
relative clause:
(518)“[...] ñåà níì-ĩ ̊ ì tiempo i ̀ nűà i ̋chī-pūrāküʼ̋ ü̃́ [...].”

“My name is such and such,] I’ve been working here for this long [lit. ‘this
is the time that I’ve been working here for it’] [...].”’ [jgs 335]
Apart from its function as an index, /i ̋=/ also frequently serves as a mere progressive aspect marker (expressing an aspectual notion comparable to the one
encoded by the English be+-ing construction). This function of /i ̋=/ is very likely
to be derived from its function as an index for a duration complement just discussed.
Possibly the only difference between contexts where /i ̋=/ serves as an index for
a duration complement and contexts where it functions as a progressive marker
is that an explicit duration referent is present in the former (e.g. tiempo ‘time’ in
(518)) while no such referent is explicitly identified in the latter. This is why I use
the same gloss for /i ̋=/ whether it functions as an index or as an aspect marker. Instances of /i ̋=/ in its function as a progressive marker are featured in the following
two examples ((520) is repeated from (324) for convenience; see also (T104)):

(ii) /ne̋=/nű=/ ‘ctrpet.3aloc’. In one particular configuration, areal locative participants are not indexed with /i ̋=/ but with the morpheme /ne̋=/
nű=/ instead. This happens when the indexed areal locative participant specifically refers to the source of a centripetal motion, as in the relative clause /nůʼkǘmá

they founded this community], Agua Blanca [i.e. a river a couple of hours
upriver of San Martín].’ [jsg A355–357]
Note that the index /ne̋=/nű=/ is employed even when the ground participant it indexes is already expressed as a NP in front of the predicative phrase
(which is virtually always the case in practice), as long as that participant is to be
interpreted as the source of a centripetal motion, as in examples (522) and (523).
Participants with most other syntactic functions are normally not indexed on the
predicative phrase when they are syntactically present as a NP preceding it.

In other words, the presence of the index /ne̋=/nű=/ is what signals that the motion is centripetal, which is why it must remain on the predicative phrase whether
it functions as an ordinary index (in the absence of a coreferential NP preceding the
predicative phrase) or as a kind of agreement marker (in the presence of a coreferential NP preceding the predicative phrase). In the absence of /ne̋=/nű=/, the
same areal locative participant would be interpreted as the goal of a non-centripetal
motion ((522), for instance, would then be interpreted as ‘The tourists go everywhere.’).
Note that although (521–523) refer to centripetal motions oriented towards the
speaker themselves, as is frequently the case, this need not always be the case. Centripetal motions can be conceived of as motions whose path is oriented towards the
most activated ground topic, which indeed often, but not always, coincides with
the location of the speaker (see (574) for an occurrence of /ne̋=/nű=/ contributing to the encoding of a centripetal motion not oriented towards the speaker).
The distribution between the variants /ne̋=/ and /nű=/ is a subdialectal
one, with most speakers using the former (lar, jsg, igv, among others) and only
a few speakers using the latter (among whom jgs and gsg).
(iii) /i ̀=/ ‘3ploc’. Although its exact distribution remains unclear, the morpheme /i ̀=/ seems to function essentially as an index standing for a third person
punctual locative (ploc) participant, as in the following example:
(524)̃́
“Chòmà rǜ tá, kóyàʼü̃̀ tá níì-ĩ ̊ i ̀ chàgǜ {?} tá ìchà-üʼ̂ ü.”

surroundings] under the shape of a caiman.”’ [lar T153]
4645.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types
In this example, /i ̀=/ is most likely added to the predicative phrase because the
speaker feels that the verb ǘ ‘to put (sg.)’, being a motion verb, and more specifically
a non-durative one (on the distinction between durative vs non-durative motion
verb roots, see Section 4.2.3), semantically requires a locative complement, and
more specifically a ploc one, although there is no need for mentioning any specific
locative complement in the context. Note, however, that /i ̀=/ is optional in this
utterance (as was confirmed to me by ear, with the help of whom I transcribed the
utterance in (524)) and does not contribute any referential meaning. In most of its
occurrences, the index /i ̀=/ thus seems to serve, like in (524), as a mere optional
filler for a semantically called for but morphosyntactically optional complement position. In my data, such occurrences of /i ̀=/ are especially frequent in
association with the verbs tó ‘to plant’ and g̃û/yi ̀ ‘to fall (sg./pl.)’.
For unclear reasons, inflected occurrences of the verb gṵ (pcØ/pci ̄) ‘to finish’
especially frequently include /i ̀=/ when that verb specifically means ‘to reach its
end (at a certain point in space or in a discourse performance)’. In co-occurrence
with this verb, /i ̀=/ typically remains even in the presence of a ploc NP preceding the predicative phrase (which is not the case with the verbs just mentioned
above). This is shown in the following example (contrast, however, example (164),
an essentially parallel example that does not involve the co-occurrence of /i ̀=/
with gṵ ‘to reach its end’):
(525)Ngĕʼmá níì-ĩ ̊ i ̀ ngēmà ìnà-gűʼü̃́ ērǘ ná-nûʼu.

It could be that the presence of /i ̀=/ in finite forms of certain predicative phrases
has lexicalized to the point of tending to become obligatory in any context.277
The morpheme /i ̀=/ is homonymous with a handful of other morphemes
in the language, in particular /i ̀=/ ‘pcø.sbjv’, /i ̀=/ ‘pci ̄\sbjv’, /i ̀=/ ‘pci ̀’, /i ̀=/
‘pci ̀.sbjv’, and /i ̀=/ ‘lk.ns’. This often seriously complicates its identification,
Compare the French lexicalized phrase y aller ‘to leave’ (lit. ‘to go to it’) as in Je vais devoir y
aller ‘I should probably get going’, which likewise involves a non-referential spatial index y.
2774655. Inflection of the predicative phrase
not only to the foreign analyst but possibly also to speakers themselves. This might
explain why some speakers occasionally use /i ̋=/ where /i ̀=/ could have been expected, thereby generalizing the use of /i ̋=/ to the indexation of both aloc and
ploc participants. Thus, while the locative complement that the verb ãu
̰ ‘to stay’
̂
̋ -ʼü̃́/
takes is normally a ploc complement, the relative clause /nü-mà i ̋=nà=ãu
(3n/ns-anaph 3aloc=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=stay\sbjv-rel.ns) ‘where he is’
in example (526), which precisely relativizes a complement of that verb, does not
feature the ploc index /i ̀=/ to resumptively stand for the pivot, but the aloc index
/i ̋=/ instead:

be the same slot as the third person locative participant indexes (for why I hypothesize these two types of indexes to belong to the same slot, see introduction to
Section 5.7.2 above). These partitive object indexes are part of an intricate system of encoding of partitively affected third person objects. This grammatical
system is of relatively unfrequent use in discourse. Note that due to the limited
number of unequivocal instances of its use in my corpus, the analysis of it I present
here relies for a large part on elicited utterances and must therefore be considered
as tentative.
Masculine partitive objects are indexed on the predicative phrase by means
of a proclitic /nè=/, neuter ones by means of /ne̋=/ (which possibly displays a
subdialectal variant /nű=/), and non-salientive ones by means of /tà=/ (whose
identification may be complicated by the fact that it is homonymous with several
other morphemes in the language, in particular /=tà/ ‘add’). As discussed below,
feminine and salientive partitive objects, which do not have dedicated indexes,
can only be referred to pronominally by means of independent pronouns in the
partitive case. Instances of use of /ne̋=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ and /tà=/ ‘3ns.part.obj’
4665.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types
as ordinary indexes (i.e. elements referring to the participant in the absence of a
NP referring to it in front of the predicative phrase) are provided in examples (527)
and (528), respectively. The nominal class of the indexed partitive objects in these
two examples (n and ns, respectively) is clear from the context.

who keep injuring my animals(.ns)?] If that’s what you want, kill some
properly!”’ [gra 276]
The partitive object indexes remain, however, in the presence of a NP that is coreferential with them and precedes the predicative phrase, as shown in example (529).
This is most likely because they are the only way to indicate that the object is partitively, and not totally, affected in the process (see Section 5.7.2.1, paragraph
(ii) above for the similar case of the index /ne̋=/nű=/ ‘ctrpet.3aloc’ remaining
in the presence, in front of the predicative phrase, of a NP coreferential with the
participant it indexes).

As shown in examples (530) and (531), the encoding of masculine partitive
objects is highly anomalous in that it involves the obligatory indexation of the
participant on the predicative phrase not only as the index /nè=/ ‘3m.part.obj’,
but also, simultaneously, as an ordinary core object index (represented by /nā=/
in (530) and /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’ in (531)). This intriguing feature was confirmed
during elicitation sessions to be regular.

The encoding of feminine and salientive partitive objects involves the use of
the independent pronouns bearing the partitive suffix -ʼnè, i.e. /ngi ̂-ʼnè/ (3fpart) and /tü̂-ʼnè/ (3s-part). Note that the partitive suffix -ʼnè is only attested
in these morphological compounds in my corpus. The partitive object pronouns
ngi ̂ʼnè and tüʼ̂ nè, similarly to the partitive object indexes discussed above, may serve
either as ordinary pronouns, as in (532), or as a kind of resumptive pronoun that
is coreferential with a NP that precedes the predicative phrase, as in (533). In the
latter case, the partitive object pronoun is likely maintained because it is the only
available strategy for encoding grammatically the fact that the object is partitively,
not totally, affected in the process.

The neuter partitive object index /ne̋=/ is relatively well attested in a specific
kind of intransitive construction where it cannot, by definition, function as an index
for a partitive object, but functions instead as what could be characterized as an index for a partitive areal locative participant. In this construction, which always
features an areal locative participant referring to a static location or a goal ground
(in practice, nű [prox.aloc] ‘all around here’ or /gű-ʼü̃́-wa̋/ [finish\sbjv-rel.nsaloc] ‘everywhere’), /ne̋=/ explicitly indicates that the process only occurs in or
towards most—but not all—subparts of the ground, which is not to be conceived
of as an indivisible whole but rather as a set of potentially involved “sub-grounds”.
Note that in this specific use, the partitive index /ne̋=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ is also attested under a subdialectal variant /nű=/ (compare the variants /ne̋=/nű=/ of
the areal locative index discussed in Section 5.7.2.1, paragraph (ii) above).
Thus, in example (534), the presence of /nű=/ explicitly indicates that the
speaker did not literally go everywhere in the region, but to most places in the
region, in a spontaneous and cumulative fashion, rather than in an organized and
systematic way:

the communities X, Y, Z, etc.] In short, I went just about everywhere.’ [jgs
770]
Likewise, in (535), the presence of /nű=/ indicates that Peta-Peta did not literally
examine all the parts of the body of the Tikuna man, but most of its parts:278
278The subtle shade of meaning contributed by /ne̋=/nű=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ in this construction is4695.8. Associated motion (slot 5)
that this grammatical category is particularly common in the languages of the western half of the Amazonian basin, among which it is highly likely to have spread by
contact (2016). Associated motion in smat is a semantically fairly simple category
that essentially contributes meanings such as ‘go/come (i.e. undergo a motion
unspecified for path) and perform the main process denoted by the lexical
component of the predicative phrase’, as shown in the following example:
(536)“Ngü,̂ chā-pūrākǘã̰ níì-ĩ ̊ rǜ kǘ chārǖ finca pēyàrǖ-chĕʼgü!̋ ” ñâʼü.̃́ Nge̋mà gá,

go (pl.) clear my farm [i.e. from unwanted vegetation with a machete]!”
he said. And then there was a fifteen-day vacation period and we went and
worked there.’ [jgs 694–698]
Note that associated motion is relatively rare in smat discourse, with motion of
subject arguments being much more frequently expressed by lexical means, i.e. by
means of specialized verbs of motion.
Associated motion in smat belongs to the grammatical categories that are encoded through the inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase (it
occupies a morphological slot of its own—slot 5—within the inflectional template of
the predicative phrase, although its encoding is in practice often merged into portmanteau morphemes together with the encoding of categories belonging in neighboring slots; see Section 5.1). It may consequently only occur in finite predicative phrases. This clearly distinguishes it from the semantically close but separate
smat category of “direction” (grammatical encoding of the “path” of a location or
a motion), which is encoded by means of derivational suffixes (see Section 4.2.3).
The exponent of associated motion is a proclitic morpheme /yà=/, which either encodes associated motion alone, as in example (536), or is a portmanteau
morpheme that simultaneously serves as an exponent for associated motion and a
third person index and/or the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, as in (541) (on /yà=/

The encoding of a round-trip or circular path281 within a single predicative phrase
(as in e.g. ‘go and come back’, whether taking the same route or different routes),
in particular, is apparently regularly obtained by the combination of associated
motion with a motion verb suffixed with the figure-ground configuration morpheme
/-ègù/ ‘inv’ (yielding complex predicative phrases with literal meanings such as ‘go
and [perform the lexically-encoded motion event back to the initial point]’). The
following two examples feature instances of such a combination:

"6.1Semantics and syntaxThe verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ is semantically vague and may in principle refer
to virtually any kind of process. It will consequently be found with such diverse
translations as ‘do (like that), move (like that), say (like that), ask (like that), call
(like that), sound (like that), think (like that), decide (like that), etc.’.285 Its one and,
most of the time, stable semantic (and pragmatic) feature is its deictic function.
This deictic component may essentially target (or one might say “point at”) two
different kinds of objects, some of a linguistic (or minimally vocalic) nature, others
of an extra-linguistic nature. Note that the elements targeted by the deictic verb
are marked out by square brackets in all the examples presented throughout this
chapter.
In the first case, the ‘doing thus’ targets a piece of linguistic discourse as such
(i.e. primarily as a signifier in the Saussurean sense), or occasionally a non-linguistic
vocalic production (e.g. a melody), just produced or soon to be produced by the
speaker. The deictic verb can then be said to fulfill an endophoric function.286
This is not to say that the deictic verb is a filler, i.e. a semantically-empty verb whose only
function is to fill in the morphosyntactic position of a predicative phrase in cases where a speaker
finds him or herself unable to—or does not want to—use a semantically-determined predicative
phrase. This predicative-phrase-filler function is carried out by the interrogative-indefinite word åkǘ
‘what?.ns’ (or its extended variant /åkǘ-ʼǘ̃/ ‘what?.ns\sbjv?-rel.ns’), as in the following example:
285̃́ ǘkùchí.

put.sg-in.sg‘[...] and I, uh... [lit. ‘and I somethinged ...’] I put a rubber band around it.’ [rca F42–43]
From Lyons’ perspective, this kind of deictic reference would possibly be analyzed as “pure
textual deixis” (like the kind of deictic reference involved by it in e.g. That’s a rhinoceros. – A what?

According to the nature of the endophoric target, which may be a mere name, a
complete utterance, a non-uttered cognitive content, an onomatopoeia, etc., the
deictic verb will be respectively translatable as ‘call target’ (as in example (581)),
‘say target’ (582), ‘think target’ (580), ‘make target’ (583), etc. The deictic
verb is especially pervasive in its use as a device introducing direct speech,
although direct speech does not obligatorily require its presence.

The target of the deictic component of the deictic verb may be, on the other
hand, a strictly extra-linguistic process. This is typically a gesture performed by
the speaker while they are uttering the deictic verb, but it may also be any physical
process being achieved by some other entity present in the utterance situation and
5026.1. Semantics and syntax
‘[...] when [the jaguar] took a step, it made “Flau!” [as its movements
cause some air to be ejected through a flute that was thrust into its anus].
It took another step and went “Flau! Flau!”’ [lar D166–168]
In this construction, the deictic verb functions as a semantically-empty auxiliary
verb whose only morphosyntactic function is to bear the encoding of the inflectional
values of the whole predicative phrase it forms together with the verbal lexeme that
constitutes its core object. Parallel examples by other speakers are needed, however, to confirm the status of this syntactic strategy as a genuine, grammaticalized
construction.
Interestingly, whether the target of the deictic verb is a piece of discourse, a gesture, an anaphoric, or a non-finite verb, its exact syntactic function cannot be established with certainty. As a corollary, whether the deictic verb is morphosyntactically intransitive or transitive appears to be an unanswerable question.
From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, nothing definitively precludes from
analyzing the deictic verb’s target as a core object, since core objects in smat are
in the zero-case, i.e. are left morphologically unmarked for their syntactic function.
Thus, there is the possibility that the anaphoric ngēmà ‘that’ in example (585),
which stands in the zero-case, is indeed to be interpreted as the core object argument of the deictic verb. On the other hand, no language internal facts seem
to offer positive evidence for the analysis of the deictic verb’s target as its object.
Regular predicative phrases can be unequivocally told to be transitive or intransitive depending on whether or not they require the indexation of a core object in
contexts where, all other things being equal, they are not preceded by any syntactic NP (in the zero-case) that might function as their core object (thus fè ‘to
shoot’ in /kŏwǘ ná=fè/ [deer 3m/n/ns.sbj=shoot] ‘she/he shot the deer’ can be
definitively identified as a transitive verb because */ná=fè/ is not acceptable as
is with the meaning ‘he shot (it)’, which can only be conveyed by /ná=nā=fè/
[3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot], i.e. with the inclusion of an object index).
The inflectional paradigm of the deictic verb does not seem to display any marking
for object indexes, but this cannot be taken as definitive evidence for the verb’s
intransitive nature due to its morphological uniqueness in the language (see Section 6.2). In principle, it might simply be that the deictic verb, although transitive,
has the unique morphological ability to occur without an object index in contexts
where it lacks an object NP preceding it. These considerations leave open the
question of the syntactic relationship, if any, that holds between the deictic
verb and its target in smat. This is why I have opted for labeling the target with
a syntactically neuter term, instead of referring to as e.g. a complement.
5056. The deictic verb
The subject of the deictic verb is typically an animate referent, as in most
examples in this section, or less frequently a concrete, inanimate referent. But
it may also occasionally be an abstract entity, such as a speech, a story, a call,
a song, a thought, a person’s mind, etc. In such cases, the deictic verb does not,
strictly speaking, refer to a process (‘do thus’) being carried out by the subject. It can
rather be considered in practice as the equivalent of an equative verb, and functions
more specifically as a deictic equative verb (‘be thus’). Its specialized use is then
to introduce a linguistic, cognitive, or vocalic object that is being equated with
the subject. This is illustrated in example (618), where the ‘speaking’ (déʼà) that
is taking place is equated with, or defined as, the question enclosed in quotation
marks (see also example (594) below):

In addition to a subject argument, the deictic verb may optionally take an argument marked for the accusative case (to be distinguished from a core object,
which does not bear any syntactic-function marking, as mentioned above) in cases
where it specifically refers to an uttering-process (i.e. a piece of linguistic discourse
actually spoken). The referent of that argument is the addressee of the utteringprocess mentioned by the speaker. This is illustrated at the end of example (582)
above. Note that such accusative arguments may only consist of explicit nps as they
cannot be indexed on the deictic verb.
When used endophorically, the deictic verb is virtually always immediately
adjacent to the piece of linguistic discourse (or non-linguistic vocalic production) it points at. As a consequence, its arguments—whether a subject or a
complement in accusative—normally precede the deictic verb when the latter itself
5066.1. Semantics and syntax
precedes its target ((sbj) (acc) deictic.verb “target”). This is illustrated in the
following example (see also the beginning of example (582) above):289

136]
Conversely, the arguments of the deictic verb normally follow the latter when it
itself follows its target (“target” deictic.verb (lk=sbj) (acc), or “target” deictic.verb (acc) (lk=sbj)).290 This is illustrated in the following example (see
also the end of example (582) above).

[jsg B264–265]
This strong ordering tendency, combined with the fact that the deictic verb cannot
bear indexes for syntactic functions other than subject, regularly leads to the otherwise relatively unusual presence of main constituents bearing case-marking (in this
See example (268), however, for an utterance in which the deictic verb (which precedes its
target) is exceptionally separated from it by its subject argument.
289Note that the linker regularly introduces such postposed subjects, as they have necessarily
already been referred to within the clause through the encoding of the subject argument included
in the inflected deictic verb. By contrast, complements in the accusative post-posed to the deictic
verb are usually not introduced by the linker, as they are then being referred to for the first time
within the clause (they cannot have been already referred to through indexation on the inflected
deictic verb, in particular). On the syntactic distribution of the linker, see Section 3.5.

case, accusative case-marking) after an inflected predicative phrase. In other contexts, when a main nominal constituent occurs after an inflected predicative phrase,
dependent-marking on that constituent is typically avoided in favor of other strategies such as head-marking on the inflected predicative phrase (see Section 3.6.1).
As was noted above, the deictic verb is by far the most favored device resorted
to for introducing direct speech. Semantically more specific utterance verbs rarely
fulfill this function by themselves. It is therefore not rare for the deictic verb to
co-occur with a semantically more specific verb in what can be analyzed as
a unique case of serial-verb construction in the language. This construction
facilitates the use of semantically specific utterance verbs as (co-)introducers of
direct speech. In this construction, two finite predicative phrases featuring the
same subject and referring to the same event follow each other with no intonational
break. One of the two finite predicative phrases is the deictic verb (always inflected
in sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/). It is preceded by its endophoric target (e.g. a complete utterance in
direct speech), or occasionally followed by it, in cases where it occurs second of the
two finite predicative phrases. The other finite predicative phrase (which is, for
its part, freely inflected in any of the three Inflectional Types) refers lexically to a
specific type of uttering process (‘to say’, ‘to ask’, ‘to answer’, ‘to call’, ‘to rebuke’,
etc.). In most cases, the two predicative phrases involved in this construction are
arranged in the order just suggested:
[target] deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP1 specific.uttering.processPP2
although the opposite ordering also occurs:
specific.uttering.processPP1 deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP2 [target]
Examples (591) and (592) feature typical instances of this construction. Note that
the two finite predicative phrases in the construction under discussion may be separated by enclitics (such as /=ãʼ̄ a/ ‘quot’, which may occur between all sorts of
constituents in the language, and /=gá/ ‘pst’, which usually behaves as a secondposition clitic, in (591)) or by complements of the one that refers to a specific
uttering process (such as /tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ [3s-acc] ‘him’ in (592)).

Example (593) displays a variant of this construction in which the finite predicative
phrase that refers to a specific uttering process takes an expletive non-salientive
comitative complement /ná-máʼa/ (3n/ns-com), lit. ‘with it’. This complement
is anaphorically coreferential with the target and redundantly refers to the piece
of direct speech “with which” (i.e. uttering which) the specific uttering process is
performed.291

[lit. ‘... he said he shouted with it.’].’ [lar E178–179]
For what is likely an instance of the construction under discussion displaying the
rarer of its two ordering variants mentioned above (with the deictic verb occurring after, instead of before, the predicative phrase referring to a specific uttering
process), see example (596) below.
Note that the comitative relational noun /-máʼa/ is similarly used to mark e.g. the name argument of the verb ū (pcØ) ‘to call someone or something (Core obj) something (com)’. This morphosyntactic observation regarding a semantically comparable kind of predicative phrase supports
the analysis I propose for the complement námáʼa ‘with it’ optionally occurring in the construction
under discussion in the present section.
2915096. The deictic verb
Of all the interrogative-indefinite words, only ñùʼ(u), which I gloss as ‘what
activity?’, may occupy the syntactic position of target of the deictic verb. Åkǘ
‘what?.ns’ and ñùʼãk̀ ǜ ‘how?’, in particular, are not available in this position. Conversely, ñùʼ(u) may only occur as the target of the deictic verb, for which it serves as
a specialized interrogative-indefinite.292 In practice, ñùʼ(u) is most of the time realized in its shortened variant ñùʼ, especially by younger speakers (on this phonologically exceptional form featuring a glottal stop that surfaces in word-final position
without being followed by an epenthetic vowel, see Section 2.1.3.1). It always
immediately precedes the deictic verb. The following example features an instance
of ñùʼ(u) in its interrogative function:
(594)̄

“Ñùʼù ñâʼü̃́ i ̀ kúãʼ̋ è, nágù kùrǖ-ĩnǜʼü

your mind do like, [what does] what you’re thinking about [do like]?’]”’
[igs 227–228]
Although it is undoubtedly derived from the deictic verb, the invariable vagueness marker ñâʼü̃́ ‘about, something like’ is better treated as distinct from it from
a strictly synchronic perspective. This marker occurs at the end of an NP whose
literal meaning it qualifies as being only an indicative approximation used for establishing a vague referent. In most cases, this NP is a Spanish phrase inserted by
code-mixing, as in the following example:
(595)Nárǖ-ngǜgǘ, eh... hasta las cinco de la tarde ñâʼü.̃́

rest, uh... like until five p.m.’ [jgs 158–159]
Although ñùʼ(u) is also present etymologically in the synchronically unanalyzable interrogativè ǜ/ ‘man’), ñùʼgù ‘when?’
indefinite words ñùʼãk̀ ǜ ‘how?’ (etymologically composed of ñùʼ(u) and /-ãk
(from ñùʼ(u) and /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ or /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’), and ñùʼré ‘how much? how many?’ (from ñùʼ(u) and
a bound morpheme */-ʼré/ ‘amount?’, on which see note 218).
2925106.2. Inflectional morphology
This marker ñâʼü̃́ likely arose through the grammaticalization of the sequence ‘target’ /ñâ-ʼǘ̃/ (“target’ do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-rel.ns’), lit. ‘what they call
‘target”.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516]"
"4.2.3.6/-V̄chi ̀/ ‘at’An illustration of the use of the FGC suffix /-V̄chi ̀/ ‘at’, which denotes a [+propinquity] topological relation, is provided in example (304) (intransitive PP).

Note, importantly, that despite the English translation of /ṹ-ūchi ̀/ (go.sg-at) as
‘came closer’ in example (304) (i.e. a translation that implies a notion of perspective
of an observer upon the process), the suffix /-V̄chi ̀/ does not in itself involve
any semantic indication of deixis. All this suffix tells in this utterance is that
over the course of the process (in this case, a durative spontaneous motion), the
figure (in this case, the deer) tends towards standing in a topological relation of

deictic perspective imposed by a translation of this utterance into English is entirely
absent from its original smat version.
This FGC suffix, like its negative counterpart /-gàchi ̀/ ‘away’ (discussed in the
next section), is rare in discourse.","[310, 311]"
"4.2.3Suffixes encoding figure-ground
configurationsThe following paragraphs first introduce the general morphosyntactic and
semantic properties of the figure-ground configuration (FGC) suffixes from a
global and theoretically-oriented perspective. The use of each of these suffixes
in discourse is illustrated further below in the dedicated subsections 4.2.3.1 through
4.2.3.11.
2934. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
The FGC suffixes are a system of 11 derivational suffixes of the verb root that
characterize the spatial relation in which a figure stands relative to a ground in the
process denoted by the verb root (for a list of these suffixes, see Table 36). The
figure participant corresponds to the subject of intransitive verbs and to the (core)
object of transitive verbs. The ground by reference to which the spatial relation
of the figure is characterized typically corresponds to a non-core participant that
may be explicitly expressed as an NP in the areal (aloc) or punctual (ploc) locative
syntactic functions, indexed on the predicative phrase by means of a locative index
standing for a participant in the aloc or ploc syntactic function (on which see
Section 5.7.2.1), or left implicit in the context. Whether the ground is encoded as
a participant in the aloc or in the ploc syntactic function depends on whether at
the final phase of the process the figure is in a relation of contiguity with the ground
(in which case it is encoded as a ploc participant) or whether at the final phase
of the process no such relation is prevailing between the figure and the ground (in
which case the ground is encoded as a aloc participant). For a straightforward
illustration of this distinction, contrast examples (303) and (302) on p.304. In
the former example, the figure (a group of people) gets to be contiguous with the
ground (a tuk-tuk) by getting on it. The ground is accordingly encoded as a ploc
participant (NP /motocarro-gú/ ‘tuk.tuk-ploc’). In (302), by contrast, the reverse
process occurs, whereby the same figure gets off the same ground. The relation
of contiguity between the figure and the ground prevailing at the initial phase of
the process is cancelled. The ground is accordingly encoded as a aloc participant
(index /i ̋=/ ‘3aloc’).
Note that the ground may also occasionally coincide with the figure itself
as it stands at the initial phase of the process, although this particular case is
comparatively rare in discourse. The FGC suffixes then characterize the spatial
relation (sometimes a metaphorical one) in which the figure stands during or at the
end of the process relative to itself as it stood at the beginning of the process (for
instances of figure-ground configurations encoded by the FGC suffixes in which the
ground corresponds to the figure itself as it stands at the initial phase of the process,
see Sections 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.3, and 4.2.3.9).
The spatial relations encoded by the FGC suffixes may be relations tended towards over the course of the process or achieved at the end of the process.
This depends on the Aktionsart properties of the verb root. Spontaneous and caused
motion verb roots, in particular, with which the FGC suffixes co-occur in an overwhelming majority of cases in discourse (although these suffixes may also occur on
non-motion verb roots), are lexically distributed in a durative and a non-durative
2944.2. Verbal predicative phrases
tends towards being at the opposite side of the ground’ relative to where that figure
stands at the initial phase of the process).
/-ègù/ ‘inv’ does not denote a specific subtype of topological relation but indicates instead that the topological relation prevailing at the initial phase of the
process is inverted in the process, i.e. shifts from plus to minus or the other way
around (whereby the figure ‘gets to be or tends towards being generally contiguous
with the ground while it was initially not contiguous with it’, ‘gets to be or tends
towards being at the ground while it was initially away from it’, ‘gets to be or tends
towards being off the ground while it was initially on it’, etc.). This suffix thus
essentially functions as an inverter of topological relation polarity. In cases where
the figure coincides with the ground, /-ègù/ indicates that the figure gets to stand
or tends towards standing in a reversed orientation by reference to a plane tangent
to it or intersecting it (e.g. ‘the poster is hanging backwards’, ‘the canoe capsized’,
‘I put the glass upside down’, ‘I turned my pants inside out’).
/-a̽/ ‘plloc’ denotes a plural topological relation (whereby the figure ‘gets
to be at several spots of the ground or tends towards being at several spots of the
ground’).
The exact semantic contribution of the comparatively rare suffix /-yé/
‘in.the.middle’, finally, is less clear. I tentatively analyze it as belonging to the
set of the FGC suffixes (although it might perhaps be better considered as a nonFGC derivational suffix of the PP) and describe it as a suffix denoting a medial
topological relation (whereby the figure ‘gets to be in the middle of the ground
or tends towards being in the middle of the ground’).
On the encoding of static topological relations in the absence of a verb root,
which is implemented by non-verbal PPs made of an NP attached with the predicative relational noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, see Section 4.3.3.1.","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302]"
"3.4. Non-locative demonstratives
‘And the cup that’s mouth up [i.e. not the other cup, which is mouth down],
does it have a pink rubber band [in it] already?’ [rca B45]
Note that the non-locative endophorics are not obligatory in this function.
In the following example, where four different generic categories of criminals are
mentioned and distinguished from one another by means of relative clauses, only
the NPs referring to the first (ngēmà ma̋et̀ āʼü̃́ ‘the one who has committed a murder’)
and the third (ngēmà chîʼēʼü̃́ üğ üʼ̋ ü̃́ ‘those who have done a wrong’) categories involve
the use of a determinative endophoric demonstrative.

Interestingly, the use of the smat endophorics as definite determiners is not
limited to NPs modified by a relative clause, but may also extend to NPs modified
by other modifiers such as the numerals, as in example (184), or the modifier
independent noun ‘other’, as in (185).
2273.4. Non-locative demonstratives
endophoric ño̊má with the suffix (or bound noun?) /-ǜ̃kǘʼü/ ‘time’, yielding the
̃̀ ʼ́ ü ‘these days’, relates to this function of the proximal endophoric
form ño̊máüküdemonstrative. See also examples (T15), (T17), and (T85) for uses of ño̊má in head
syntactic position in association with the relational noun /-ʼǜ̃/ ‘state’, yielding the
meaning ‘in this state [in which one of us is while we’re talking]’.
In this function, however, the proximal endophoric demonstrative is in most
cases replaced by the proximal exophoric in younger speakers, as in the following example, where the proximal exophoric ño̊má would have been equally correct and would have conveyed the same meaning (see also (159) above, where the
proximal exophoric dômà could probably have been used instead of the proximal
exophoric dâà):
(187)[...] ñṵmá i ̀ ñåà mundowa̋ chā-sufre i ̀ chòmà.

himself with his whole hand].’ [ano1 166]
Certain occurrences of the proximal endophoric demonstrative do not appear to
quite correspond to this “symbolic use”, however, as in examples (188–189). It
is unclear what its exact semantic and pragmatic value is in these rare occurrences.
The discourse contexts of (188) and (189) would rather have led to expect a medial
or distal endophoric demonstrative with an ordinary anaphoric function, instead of
a proximal endophoric, since the referents in question have been previously established as topics.

On a non-demonstrative grammaticalized use of the proximal endophoric
ño̊má as a near-preposition meaning ‘like’, see Sections 3.6.3 (ño̊má may also occasionally function as a near-conjunction meaning ‘while, as long as’).
Like their exophoric analogs discussed at the end of the preceding section, the
specifically plural salientive forms of the endophoric demonstratives (column s.pl
in Table 33) are used in marginal cases where the speaker wants to make explicit that they are referring to a plural, not singular, referent assigned to the
salientive nominal class. The default salientive forms (column s) can indiscriminately be used in reference to both singular or plural referents. An occurrence of
the specifically plural salientive distal endophoric is provided in example (190).
Because at this particular moment of the conversation, both the speaker’s mother
(a singular referent assigned to the salientive nominal class) and her brothers (a
plural referent equally assigned to salientive) are highly activated topics, she uses
a specifically plural salientive form (specifically, in this pre-hodiernal past context,
̀ àtá) to make clear that she is referring to the latter. In such a context,
the distal gŭãm
the corresponding default salientive form (gûʼèmá) could have been misinterpreted
as referring to her mother (although in this particular case, the plurality of the
referent is redundantly encoded by the plural marker /-gǘ/).

duces a referent from the text-external world (while Lambrecht also discusses the
existence of presentational constructions that introduce entities that are not present
in the speech setting; 1994:39, 177–181).
This construction involves a non-locative demonstrative functioning as the
predicative complement of the verb i ̃̊ ‘be’. In most cases, the subject is syntactically present, in which case it always follows the verb i ̃̊. Note that the latter,
when inflected in the Indicative Inflectional Type, may be omitted (as in (160) and
(200); it cannot be omitted, by contrast, when it is inflected in the Subjunctive
Inflectional Type, as in (199)), as is regularly the case when it occurs as the main
verb of a clause. This construction may be summarized as follows:
non-locative.dem (3sbj=be) (lk=NPsbj )
In most cases, the non-locative demonstrative employed in this construction is
an exophoric demonstrative in /-à/ ‘exo’ (see Section 3.4.2). The three grammatical degrees of distance of the demonstratives (prox, med, dist) then take their
regular physical range interpretation. Example (196) illustrates the case of a presentational construction involving a proximal exophoric non-locative demonstrative: the referent introduced is located in the very hand of the speaker (see
(160) above and (T18) for additional cases of proximal presentational construction).

were taking something from the pocket of his pants], keep going!” they

A case of presentational construction involving a medial exophoric demonstrative
is provided in (197): the referent introduced is located at a short distance from both
speaker and hearer.

‘Here [lit. ‘There ...’] is the house [i.e. at a short distance]!’ [jsg elic.]
Finally, a case of presentational construction involving a distal exophoric demonstrative is provided in (198): the referent introduced is coming from far away from
both speaker and hearers. Note that in this example the distance implied is emphasized by prosodic means, specifically through the lengthening of the stressed
syllable of the distal demonstrative.

from the distance: ...’]: she’s naked!”’ [igs 115]
In some cases, presentational constructions involving an exophoric non-locative
demonstrative seem to convey a locational meaning (X is here.) instead of fulfilling a genuinely presentational function (Here is X!). The speaker in (199) has just
found that the heap of corn that she asked her daughter-in-law to make beer with
this morning is still in the exact same place when she comes back home in the afternoon. The demonstrative dâà here is probably better interpreted as a locational
predicate.

2353. The nominal phrase
Interestingly, the non-locative demonstrative employed in the presentational
construction may also be a medial endophoric demonstrative in /-ma̽/ (see Section 3.4.3). The medial endophoric is used in cases where, for some reason, the
referent introduced, although present in the speech setting, cannot be identified by pointing at it, i.e. in cases where it is not accessible to the visual perception
of speaker or hearer (or both of them). In example (200), the speaker is shouting
from a distance to his addressees, who have just stolen his axe and are running away
with it. The referent introduced by the presentational construction, specifically the
axe, is therefore not visible to the speaker and cannot be pointed at, although it is
visible to the hearer (see (593) for a parallel example where the item stolen from
the speaker is a plantain offshoot).
(200)“Ngémà í chôʼrǖ pĕtā-pe̋tà rǜ ngímáʼa pī-üğ ǘànē!”

In (201), the mythical figures Yoi and Ipi are hearing characteristic noises in the
distance, from which one of them deduces that the creature that ate up their father
must be finally arriving. The referent introduced is invisible to both speaker and
hearer, although physically present.

In (202), finally, the speaker (located in the interfluvial Tikuna community of
Buenos Aires) is most likely addressing her message to the hearer (located in San
Martín de Amacayacu) over the radio. At utterance time, the hearer (and possibly
also the speaker) cannot see the referent being introduced (the hearer’s brother),
although the latter is considered by the speaker as present, in a broad sense, in this
far from prototypical speech setting.

The proximal and distal endophoric non-locative demonstratives do not occur
in the presentational construction in my data.214
Interestingly, however, the proximal endophorics—at least—are probably able to occur in presentational constructions in Cushillococha Tikuna, where they possibly imply that the referent introduced is especially close to the deictic center although it is not visible. This is suggested by the forms
<ño2 ma2 ma3 > (whose likely smat reflex would be /ño̊-má=mā/ ‘med.ns-anaph=precisely’) and
<do23 ma4 ma2 > (smat /dô-mà=mā/ ‘med.n-anaph=precisely’) recorded by Anderson & Anderson (2016:31, 197). These forms are defined by the authors as ‘to be coming, to be approaching’,
with the former applying to ‘a dangerous animal or a dangerous person’ (i.e. to referents typically
assigned to the non-salientive nominal class) and the latter applying to a ‘motor boat, [a] motorbike, [a] car, [or a] plane’ (i.e. to referents typically assigned to the neuter nominal class). The most
plausible interpretation of this unusual translation of nominal forms by verbal phrases is that the
authors observed them employed in presentational constructions where they actually meant ‘Here
it is [very close to us although we don’t see it]!’ (with ‘it’ referring to a threatening entity or to a
vehicle, respectively). If this interpretation of Anderson & Anderson’s (2016) data is correct, then it
is possible that the proximal, and perhaps also the distal, endophorics are also able to occur in presentational constructions in smat, potentially with pragmatic implications of particular proximity
or remoteness of the referent introduced with respect to the deictic center, who does not have visual
perception of that referent. This interesting hypothesis (which would imply that some Tikuna varieties have grammatical means in at least one construction to refer exophorically to invisible physical
entities and simultaneously specify whether that invisible entity is located especially close to or far
away from the deictic center), certainly a fragile one at this stage, could be easily confirmed or
invalidated by further research. Note that it is not incompatible, in any case, with Skilton’s (2019)
demonstration that the Cushillococha Tikuna reflex of smat’s medial endophoric, when used exophorically in reference to invisible entities, may refer to entities located at any distance from the
deictic center, including on their own body (e.g. in reference to a speaker’s tooth) or beyond the
horizon (e.g. a remote town). It could be that among the endophorics, the medial one functions as
the default choice in invisible exophoric uses, without however preventing occasional uses of the
2142373. The nominal phrase3.4.6Non-locative demonstrative roots bearing a
“focal” suffixMost bound morphemes that may be attached to nominal constituents are normally bound to whole, well-formed NPs that could equally well stand on their own
in discourse. As a consequence, such bound morphemes may normally only be
attached to a whole exophoric or endophoric demonstrative, i.e. to a morphologically complex form made of a demonstrative root augmented with either
/-à/ ‘exo’ or /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’, and not to a demonstrative root alone, which cannot
constitute a well-formed NP on its own.
The “focal” suffixes, however, are usually—but not always obligatorily—
attached directly to a demonstrative root in cases where that demonstrative
serves as a syntactic head (i.e. not as a modifier) and has a syntactic function
that corresponds to the zero case (i.e. a syntactic function that does not require any
specific marking). In other words, a non-locative demonstrative such as the nonsalientive endophoric /ngē-mà/ (med.ns-anaph) ‘that one’, when combined with
the “focal” suffix /-ʼi ́ka̋/ ‘only’, may yield either /ngē-mà-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaphonly) ‘only that one’ or the less expected form /ngē-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-only) ‘only that
one’ (but /ngē-mà-máʼa-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaph-com-only) ‘only with that one’, not
*/ngē-máʼa-ʼi ́ka̋/, given the presence of syntactic function marking; and /ngē-mà
chi ̆ʼnǘ-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaph pineapple-only) ‘only that pineapple’, not */ngē chi ̆ʼnǘʼi ́ka̋/, due to the modifying function of the demonstrative). These two options apparently stand in free variation, although the latter (dem.root-“focal”.suffix)
seems to be preferred.
In my corpus, the only widely productive “focal” suffixes attested directly on
a demonstrative root are /-ʼi ́ka̋/ ‘only’, as in examples (203–204) (see also (T44)),
and /-ʼi ̋rà/ ‘first’, as in (205). Interestingly, in (204), the demonstrative ngē(ʼi ́ka̋)
‘(only) that’ is left in the zero case and its syntactic function as an accusative complement of the verb ū ‘say’ is marked by means of a co-referent accusative index
on that verb (/nǖ=/ ‘3m/n/ns.acc’; lit. ‘this only I say it with you’) instead of
being marked by means of an accusative suffix on the demonstrative itself (which
would presumably have yielded /ngē-mà-ʼü̃̄-ʼi ́ka̋/ (med.ns-anaph-acc-only), with
the suffix /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’, due to the presence of syntactic function marking).
proximal or distal ones instead in cases where speakers intend to specify the distance range that
separates the referent from the deictic center.","[231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]"

487This chapter describes the inflectional morphology of the finite predicative
phrase. Nearly all of the morphemes under study here are proclitics that immediately precede the predicative phrase. The only exception to this generalization is a suffix that is immediately attached to the right edge of the predicative
phrase. The function of many of these morphemes is to index participants with
various syntactic functions: subjects, objects, accusative participants (which are
morphosyntactically and, to a certain extent, semantically distinct from (core) objects), benefactive(-malefactive) participants, locative participants, and partitive
object participants. Other morphemes are markers of the predicative class (or
“conjugation class”, so to say) of the predicative phrase they precede. Still others encode that the predicative phrase features associated motion. A number of
these morphemes are portmanteau morphemes that realize several of these functions simultaneously. These contribute to make the predominantly agglutinative
morphology of smat fusional to a certain extent. Finally, one specific inflectional
value (the Subjunctive Inflectional Type) involves tonological alternations among
its phonological exponents and thus constitutes a case of partially suprasegmental
morphology.
Crucially, note that the inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase does
not directly encode any notions of tense, aspect, mood, or evidentiality (to
the exception—arguably—of the progressive aspect, on which see Section 5.7.2.1,
p.462). Such notions are mostly encoded by means of derivational suffixes of the
predicative phrase (see Section 4.4), clause-level enclitics and particles, or, in the
388case of tense specifically, within nominal constituents via the inflection of certain
word classes for nominal tense.
The following two examples illustrate part of these introductory observations about the formal and functional properties of the inflectional morphology of
the predicative phrase in smat:

Example (446) displays a predicative phrase inflected in the Indicative Inflectional
Type. The Indicative Inflectional Type can be considered, from a morphological
perspective, as the unmarked Inflectional Type (by contrast with the other two Inflectional Types of the language, specifically the Subjunctive Inflectional Type and,
to a certain extent, the Imperative Inflectional Type). That is why this feature is not
included in the example’s gloss. The inflectional proclitics in this example, whose
sequence represents a typical case of agglutinative morphology, successively index
a participant in the accusative (/tǖ=/ ‘3s.acc’) and a subject participant (/ná=/
‘3m/n/ns.sbj’), and encode the predicative class (or “conjugation class”) of the
predicative phrase (/rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’). This predicative class is in this case inherited by
the predicative phrase /chó-ʼẽʼ́ e/ (be.there.pl-caus) ‘to cause to be somewhere (pl.)’
from the lexical predicative class of the verb root chó ‘be there (pl.)’ from which it
is derived. Example (447) displays a predicative phrase inflected in the Subjunctive
Inflectional Type. This manifests itself suprasegmentally on one of the inflectional
proclitics (in this case, the third person subject index /nà=/ ‘3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv’,
whose toneme /1 / can be interpreted as an exponent of the Subjunctive Inflectional
Type) as well as—in principle—on the last syllable of the predicative phrase itself
(in this case, the third person object index /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’, i.e. the unique inflectional suffix of the predicative phrase, which happens not to shift toneme under
the effect of the morphotonological alternations that regularly affect the last syllable
of predicative phrases in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, hence the parentheses
3895. Inflection of the predicative phrase
in its gloss ‘3m/n/ns.obj(\sbjv)’). Note, importantly, that in glosses features with
an exclusively suprasegmental exponent are preceded by a backslash <\>. Finally,
the inflectional proclitic /yà=/ ‘am’ in (447) indicates that the main process (‘he
plucked it’) is preceded by an associated motion event (‘he went and plucked it’).
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.1 gives a general overview
of the entire inflectional template of the finite predicative phrase and of the
various morphosyntactic categories that its 8 morphological slots allow to encode.
Section 5.2 introduces, from both a formal perspective and a functional perspective, the major distinction that obtains between what I label the three Inflectional
Types (or “moods”, as a very first approximation) of the language, specifically
the Indicative Inflectional Type (ind), the Imperative Inflectional Type (imp), and
the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (sbjv). Although the morphology of all three
Inflectional Types roughly operates within the same inflectional template, their
specific paradigms differ within slots 4 to 8 of that template. Sections 5.3, 5.4,
and 5.5 successively describe the specific inflectional morphology of ind, imp,
and sbjv occurring in these slots. Section 5.6 displays a series of inflectional
charts that summarize the detailed descriptions given in Sections 5.3–5.5. Section 5.7 proceeds to describe the inflectional morphology that occurs in slots 1
to 3 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase, which remains identical across the three Inflectional Types. Sections 5.3 through 5.7 thus provide a
complete description (slots 1 through 8)—but to a large extent a formal one—of
the morphological material that contributes the encoding of inflectional features of
the predicative phrase in smat. Sections 5.8 and 5.9 respectively focus, from a
chiefly functional perspective, on two of the grammatical categories that are encoded by this morphological material, specifically associated motion (encoded in
slot 5) and predicative class (encoded in slot 6). Finally, Section 5.10 discusses
the various morphological strategies available in the language for the encoding of
the number feature of participants within the predicative phrase itself, whether
these strategies involve strictly inflectional morphological material from slots 1–8
or other morphological material.","[393, 394, 395]"
"4.2.4Other suffixesThis section deals with the few derivational suffixes of the verb root that do
not contribute encoding of figure-ground relations (for a general list of these
suffixes, see Table 36). Note that by contrast with the system of figure-ground
configuration suffixes described in the previous section, the suffixes discussed in the
present section do not form a homogeneous class from a semantic perspective.
3104.2. Verbal predicative phrases
Apart from belonging to the morphological slot of the derivational suffixes of the
verb root, they only have in common the negative property of not denoting figureground relations.
The antipassive suffixes /-ètà/ ‘antip1’ and /-ē/ ‘antip2’ are, like the morphemes discussed in the following sections, derivational suffixes of the verb root
unrelated to the encoding of figure-ground configurations. Note, however, that
these two suffixes are treated separately in Section 4.5.1 towards the end of this
chapter together with other valency-manipulating devices.","[315, 316]"

function), in which case it makes no distinction of nominal class, or it may stand
for a partitive object participant, in which case it differs whether it stands for a participant in the masculine, neuter, or non-salientive nominal class (partitive objects
in the feminine or salientive nominal class can never, for their part, be indexed on
the predicative phrase). The third person index in slot 7, which may stand for a
subject or an object argument depending on the context, may only take the values masculine/neuter/non-salientive (m/n/ns) or feminine (f). Incidentally, this
implies that salientive (s) third person subject or object arguments can never be
indexed in slot 7 and that their indexation, in contexts where they would be indexed in slot 7 if they belonged to another nominal class, therefore has to occur in
other slots (specifically in slot 4 in cases where they stand for a subject argument,
and—by a phenomenon of differential object marking—in slot 2 in cases where they
stand for an object argument, in which case they are encoded morphologically as
an accusative participant). The third person (masculine, neuter, or non-salientive)
object index in slot 8 is simply either present or absent. Likewise, the feature of
associated motion encoded in slot 5 is simply either present or absent. Finally, the
values encoded in slot 6 straightforwardly correspond to each of the five predicative classes of the language (note that pcØ, by contrast with the other predicative
classes, is morphologically unmarked in most cases, and that in such cases I do not,
accordingly, state its presence explicitly in glosses).

(as ‘.imp’, ‘.sbjv’, or ‘\sbjv’—the latter when the phonological exponent of ‘sbjv’ is
tonological). By contrast, where inflectional morphological material of ind is used,
no Inflectional Type gloss is featured (compare the glosses in examples (448a) and
(448c) below, for instance).
Imp is essentially identical to ind, except that it further lacks a slot 4.
Sbjv, by contrast with both ind and imp, does feature a slot 8, and does feature the value f in slot 7. In slot 4, however, sbjv does not feature the values
3m/n/ns, 3f, and 4. Subjects in these person & nominal class combinations are indexed in slot 7 instead. The morphemes used as explicit exponents of sbjv in slots
4 to 7 typically—but not systematically—involve a tonological deviation from
their default shape used in ind, namely a shift to toneme /1 / (as in e.g. /chā=/
‘1sg.sbj(.ind)’ featuring toneme /3 / vs /chà=/ ‘1sg.sbj\sbjv’, with /1 /; or /tá=/
‘3s.sbj(.ind)’ with /4 / vs /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’ with /1 /; but contrast these indexes,
whose toneme shifts to /1 / in sbjv, with the index /pē=/ ‘2pl.sbj(.ind)’, whose
toneme remains identical in sbjv, /pē=/ ‘2pl.sbj(.sbjv)’).
The specific inflectional morphology of each of the three Inflectional Types is
described at length in Sections 5.3–5.5.
Examples (448a–448d) illustrate the kind of morphological distinctions that
obtain between ind, imp, and sbjv. They are also intended to briefly exemplify the
kind of functional contrasts that obtain between ind (448a), imp (448b), sbjv
(448c), and the latter’s frequent combination sbjv-ʼü̃́ (448d), here comparing their
uses in main clauses (note that out of context, the translations provided in (448a–
448d) are no more than indicative translations among several other possibilities;
the function exemplified by each example is indicated in parentheses in the terms
of the functional distribution of the Inflectional Types outlined below in Table 41).

̄ ngʼü-̆ ʼü̃́
tà=rü=3s.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest\sbjv-sub‘[At that point,] she rests/she rested [specifically in a series of sequenced
processes].’
Note that the imp predicative phrase in (448b) only differs from the ind predicative phrase in (448a) by lacking a subject index in slot 4 (this informative absence
of marking is exceptionally materialized and glossed in this example as /(Ø=)/
‘(imp)’). On the other hand, the bare sbjv predicative phrase in (448c) only differs
from the ind predicative phrase in (448a) at the tonological level. The default subject morpheme /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj(.ind)’ in (448a) is replaced by /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’
in (448c). Note also that the lexical form of the verb ngǜ ‘to rest’ (with a lexical
toneme /21 /) in (448a) undergoes a morphotonological alternation process operating as a further exponent of sbjv and becomes ngʼü̆ (with a derived toneme /CM /) in
(448c). Importantly, the encoding of sbjv at a tonological level only occurs once
among the inflectional proclitics of the predicative phrase. This is why the predicative class morpheme /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ in (448c) remains identical as in (448a), as
sbjv in (448c) is already encoded tonologically on /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’. Finally, as
is self-evident, the sbjv-ʼü̃́ predicative phrase in (448d) further differs from (448a)
by the addition of the subordinator suffix /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’ to the sbjv predicative phrase
as it stands in (448c).
The general functional distribution of the three Inflectional Types proper
and sbjv-ʼü̃́ is summarized in Table 41 ([±ant] in the first rows of this table
stands for presence or absence of advancement of narrative time; on these notions,
see next section). In this table, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions are
listed together. As this table shows, only imp has a single, easily identifiable function. Ind, sbjv, and sbjv-ʼü̃́ occur in a variety of contexts with a variety of functions and display some functional overlap in main clauses. All of these functions
are extensively exemplified and commented upon in the following five sections
(5.2.2–5.2.6).

As a caveat, let me make clear that the terms Indicative, Imperative, and Subjunctive used to refer to the three Inflectional Types are to be understood as little
more than practical, mnemonic labels. Although they are borrowed from the
terminological tradition related to the grammatical category of mood, these labels
are by no means intended to suggest that the categories referred to here as
Inflectional Types can be, beyond a first approximation, identified and adequately described as moods. The functional distribution of ind, imp, and sbjv,
however, is vaguely reminiscent of that of the categories traditionally labeled as indicative, imperative, and subjunctive “moods” in the Romance languages. Because
many readers will presumably be familiar with that somewhat arbitrary terminological tradition, I have opted for applying it to smat’s Inflectional Types (rather
than arbitrarily labeling them as e.g. Inflectional Type 1, Inflectional Type 2, etc.)
with the practical purpose of making it easier for these readers to recognize and
distinguish them.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"
"5.9Predicative class assignment (slot 6)This section discusses the fairly complex lexical, semantic, and morphosyntactic bases for the assignment of predicative phrases to one of the five predicative classes of the language, specifically the unmarked predicative class (pcØ)
and the predicative classes in /i ̄=/ (pci ̄), in /i ̀=/ (pci ̀), in /rǖ=/ (pcrǖ), and in
/nà=/ (pcnà). For a detailed description of the morphological encoding of the
predicative classes, see Sections 5.3–5.5, as well as the charts at the end of Section 5.6. Their respective labels are derived from what can be shown to be their
basic morphological exponent, i.e. their only exponent that does not simultaneously
encode features unrelated to predicative class (portmanteau morpheme) but only
encodes predicative class in a straightforward manner. These basic morphological
exponents can be directly observed, in particular, in cases where the subject of a
predicative phrase inflected in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type is a syntactic NP
(as opposed to a pronominal index) that precedes that predicative phrase (see row
“Explicit NP” at bottom of Chart J, p.452).
The smat predicative classes are, as a first approximation, comparable to the
categories commonly referred to as “conjugations” or “verb groups” in the traditional grammar of the Romance languages (see the four conjugations of Classical
Latin or the three verb groups of French). They are ultimately a lexical feature
of each predicative phrase (and, among them, of verbs) that is exposed morphologically through the selection of a specific inflectional paradigm. As a
consequence, learners of the language essentially have to memorize the predicative
class of each predicative phrase as they first encounter it. Contrast, for instance,
the pairs of semantically comparable verbs in the following examples:
(549)
478a. pcØ:
chā=nā=ngo̰pci ̄:
chā=yā=àʼü5.9. Predicative class assignment (slot 6)

chā=rü=1sg.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=kill.plc. pcØ:
chā=pé1sg.sbj=sleep‘I slept’1sg.sbj=pci ̀.3m/n/ns.obj=kill.sg1sg.sbj=pcrǖ=rest‘I rested’Recall, importantly, that I do not normally include explicitly the grammatical feature pcØ in glosses (hence its absence in the glosses of the left-side forms in (549)),
as I analyze it as the default predicative class of the language. There is no obvious
morphosyntactic or semantic reason why a verb meaning ‘to eat’ should be lexically assigned to pcØ while one meaning ‘to drink’ is assigned to pci ̄ (as shown in
example (549a)), or why a verb meaning ‘to sleep’ should be lexically assigned to
pcØ while one meaning ‘to rest’ is assigned to pcrǖ (as shown in (549c)). It seems
even more arbitrary and unpredictable that the two suppletive forms of the verb
meaning ‘to kill’, one of them taking a singular object and the other one taking a
plural object, should be lexically assigned to two different predicative classes (pci ̀
for the former, pcØ for the latter, as shown in (549b)).
Certain verb morphemes may enter the formation of several lexicalized predicative phrases with different syntactic and semantic role structures and obviously
related but different meanings (contrast, for instance, /âirű-ʼü̃̄ chā=dău/ (dog-acc
1sg.sbj=see) ‘I see the dog’ vs /âirű-ka̰ chā=dău/ (dog-cause 1sg.sbj=see) ‘I
look for the dog’, where the same verb dău governs different types of complements
and takes on slightly different meanings). Often, such pairs (or larger sets) of predicative phrases based on the same verb morpheme are additionally assigned
lexically to different predicative classes. There is no apparent motivation, however, for these differences in predicative class assignment, and for why the members
of such pairs of predicative phrases are respectively assigned to this or that specific
predicative class. Contrast, for instance, the pairs of predicative phrases in the
following examples:
(550)a. pcØ:
Pērú-wa̋ chā=g̃ūpci ̄:
chi ̄=g̃ū

pcrǖ:
Juan-gù̄ inü
chā=rü=
̃̄ ̄John-ploc 1sg.sbj=pcrǖ=think‘I thought about John’However, the fact that the lexical assignment of predicative phrases to predicative classes is to be analyzed as ultimately arbitrary and unpredictable on morphosyntactic or semantic grounds does not mean that no regularities at all may
be detected in that assignment.
pcØ is clearly the default predicative class, from a morphological point of
view (what characterizes its inflectional paradigm is in many cases the absence of
morpheme in the slot where the inflectional paradigms of the other predicative
classes display a specific predicative class marker) as well as from the point of view
of the lexical distribution of predicative phrases in predicative classes. Predicative
classes with all sorts of meanings and morphosyntactic properties (whether verbal or non-verbal and intransitive or transitive, in particular) are lexically assigned
to pcØ, which likely makes it the most frequent predicative class both in the
language’s lexicon and in discourse. Spanish morphemes that are borrowed or inserted by code-mixing and used predicatively in smat (e.g. gánà ‘win’, from Sp.
gana ‘she/he wins’; sérò ‘be absent’, from Sp. cero ‘zero’; Sp. importante ‘important’,
used in smat as a verb meaning ‘be important’), are systematically assigned to pcØ,
which manifests its nature of open class.
pci ̄ is the second-largest predicative class in terms of the number of predicative phrases that are lexically assigned to it, but note that it is a closed lexical
class, by contrast with pcØ, and one with a relatively reduced number of members
compared with pcØ. All predicative phrases lexically belonging to pcØ seem to be
verbal. They may be either intransitive or transitive, and do not appear to feature clear defining semantic properties (e.g. dür̊ á ‘be unkind (intr.)’, déʼà ‘to speak
(intr.)’, â ‘to burn oneself (intr.)’, yâʼu ‘to seize (tr.)’, gû ‘to roast (tr.)’).
Few predicative phrases are lexically assigned to pcrǖ (about 20–25 different
pcrǖ predicative phrases are attested in my corpus). All of them are verbal, and
4805.9. Predicative class assignment (slot 6)
more specifically consist in or are derived from intransitive verbs. Most of them
denote processes affecting the referent corresponding to the subject but on which
̆ ā ‘to forget’,
the latter has no control or a limited control (e.g. chàu ‘be bored’, g̃üm
yù ‘to wake up’, ngǜ ‘to rest’, châ ‘to swell’, ó ‘to disappear’). But note, on the one
hand, that not all predicative phrases denoting such processes are lexically assigned
to pcrǖ (e.g. múü̃̀ ‘be afraid’ belongs lexically to pcØ and dʼăwè ‘be sick’ to pci ̄),
and, on the other hand, that a few lexical pcrǖ verbs do involve full control of the
subject (e.g. mōʼè ‘to say hello or goodbye’).
Predicative phrases assigned to pci ̀ and pcnà are, in practice, not easily detectable for phonological and morphological reasons. In particular, the inflectional
forms corresponding to these two predicative classes are in many cases identical or
extremely similar to those of the much more frequent predicative classes pci ̄ and
pcØ, respectively. What is clear, in any case, is that pci ̀ and pcnà are very limited classes in terms of the number of predicative phrases that are lexically
assigned to them. They are likely to be, in addition, obsolescent classes in the
process of merging into other predicative classes.
About 5–10 different predicative phrases that can be relatively confidently analyzed as lexically attributed to pci ̀ are attested in my corpus. All of them are
verbal. They display widely diverging meanings and may be either intransitive
or transitive, which suggests that they do not feature any defining semantic or
morphosyntactic properties (e.g. kà ‘to shout (intr.)’, nâi ‘to fart (intr.)’, dău ‘to
bother (intr., with the bothered argument marked with the relational noun /-gu̽/
‘ploc’)’, ma̰ ‘to kill (sg.; tr.)’). The copula verb i ̃̊ ‘to be’ is by far the pci ̀ predicative
phrase with the highest frequency in discourse. It is probable that the distinction
between the inflectional paradigms of pci ̄ and pci ̀ is gradually getting blurred
in today’s smat, with the result that pci ̀ predicative phrases (with the exception
of i ̃̊ ‘to be’) may optionally be inflected like pci ̄ predicative phrases without any
detectable consequence, especially in the speech of younger speakers.
Only two verbal predicative phrases that can be confidently analyzed as belonging lexically to pcnà are attested in my corpus: pù ‘to rob’ and dēyù ‘to cause to
feel cold’. Additionally, non-verbal predicative phrases formed by the predicative
relational noun /-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘like’ also belong to pcnà (e.g. /âirű-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘to resemble a
dog’). In the speech of younger smat speakers, however, the inflectional paradigm
of pcnà, although it is still identified as such passively, is being reinterpreted
in active uses of the language as the inflectional paradigm of pcØ involving
associated motion (for the inflectional paradigm of pcØ involving associated motion, see first columns of Charts C–D, G–H, and L–M, pp.449–453; on associated

motion, see Section 5.8). Contrast the pairs of semantically identical forms in
examples (551a–551b), where a conservative variant involving the specific inflectional paradigm of pcnà is given first, and the corresponding innovative variant
where that inflectional paradigm is reinterpreted as that of pcØ in the presence of
associated motion is given next:

"2173. The nominal phrase
The non-salientive form of the proximal exophoric demonstrative is also occasionally used for endophoric reference, specifically for discourse deixis as defined
by Diessel (1999:100–105), i.e. in reference to “aspects of meaning [...] expressed
by a clause, a sentence, a paragraph, or an entire story”. In example (164), the
́ n
speaker is concluding a story and the NP ñåà ūgüa
̀ è i ̀ i ̏ʼrāʼü̃́ ‘this little story’ refers
to the contents of the relatively long speech act that he is putting an end to.

Similarly, in (165), the speaker is commenting on a misadventure that happened to
his family recently and that he has just finished telling. The NP ñåà caso ‘this case’
refers to the series of events just narrated.

Note that this kind of discourse deixis function is more usually fulfilled by the nonsalientive form of the medial endophoric demonstrative (compare example (175)
below).
The specifically plural salientive forms of the exophoric demonstratives (column
s.pl in Table 32) are used in marginal cases where the speaker wants to make
explicit that they are referring to a plural, not singular, referent assigned to
the salientive nominal class. Their use is illustrated in the elicited utterance in
example (166). The default salientive forms (column s) can indiscriminately be
used in reference to both singular or plural referents.

When the processes being referred to are located in the pre-hodiernal past,
some speakers, older ones in particular, have a strong tendency to use the distal
endophoric demonstratives instead to make it explicit, as shown in examples
(171–172):

This is not systematic, however, as these speakers may use the medial endophoric
demonstratives in the same contexts. Example (173) was uttered by the same
speaker, and stems from the same text, as (171) above. Although both utterances
equally refer to pre-hodiernal past processes, participant anaphoric reference in
(173) operates with a medial endophoric demonstrative (yi ̆má), instead of a distal
one as in (171) above (gûmà):

harm to them [i.e. to Yoi and his siblings by killing their father] passed one

The ground across which the figure gets to be or tends towards being may be a
physical entity, as in (306) (in this case, the mythical figure Yoi), but it may also be,
more abstractly, a period of time, as in (T120). The verb stem bearing /-pétǜ/
may then be rendered in English as ‘to spend (time)’.
Conversely, the figure itself may be an event, i.e. an abstract entity, that
metaphorically crosses a ground corresponding to an animate being, i.e. a physical
entity. The FGC suffix /-pétǜ/ then allows a participant referring to a life experience
to stand in the syntactic function of subject of intransitive verb stems translatable
into English as ‘to happen (to an animate being)’. The animate referent with the
semantic role of experiencer is encoded as a complement in the accusative, i.e. not
as a regular ground, which is normally encoded as a participant in the punctual
or areal locative. An occurrence of /-pétǜ/ in this semantic configuration, which
is only attested with the verb roots ü/́ chó ‘be there (sg./pl.)’ and g̃ū ‘to reach’, is
provided in the following example (see also (T58)):

at the initial phase of the process gets to be or tends towards being inverted
in the process. The semantics of /-ègù/ ‘inv’ are roughly comparable with those
of English ‘back’. In example (308) (intransitive PP), for instance, the figure (in
this case, a group of people), which is not contiguous with the ground (in this case,
the village where they stay at night) at the initial phase of the process, gets to be
contiguous with it at the final phase of the process (see also (247) for a similar
example):

topological relation, i.e. a relation (achieved or tended towards) of contiguity of
the figure with the middle of the ground. An illustration of the use of this suffix
is provided in example (312) (transitive PP used in a passive construction; on the

If this analysis of /-yé/ as a FGC suffix is correct, then what is to be identified as the
figure in (312) is a cut (i.e. a non-prototypical figure) and the ground corresponds
to the skein.
Given the binary organization of part of the smat system of FGC suffixes in
pairs of suffixes respectively encoding the positive value and the negative value
of specific types of topological relations (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́, -ku̽/ [+containment] vs
/-ʼV̽chi ́, -ʼü̃̽/ [-containment]; /-V̄chi ̀/ [+propinquity] vs /-gàchi ̀/ [-propinquity]),
one may wonder whether /-yé/, if it is rightly classified as a FGC suffix, could not
be, in fact, the counterpart of the plurilocal suffix /-a̽/ (on which see the previous
section). Perhaps /-yé/ and /-a̽/ respectively denote the opposite values [singular]
and [plural] of a more general type of topological relation that one might label
[topological number]. If this hypothesis is correct, then the semantic contribution
of /-yé/ in (312) would not be to indicate that the skein was cut in its middle part
(so as to split in two halves of approximately equal size), but that it was cut in a
single cut (so as to split in two parts and no more than two). More data on this
suffix are needed to confirm or invalidate this speculative but plausible hypothesis.
This FGC suffix is rare in discourse.","[311, 312, 313, 314, 315]"
"1.2.2Data collectionTo collect the first-hand data that are analyzed in this grammatical description,
I took 4 field trips to the Colombian Amazon between October 2015 and July
2018, for a total of 9 months and a half spent in the area, of which 6 months in
sma itself (divided in stays of 1 to 8 weeks) and 3 months and a half in the regional
capital city of Leticia, where I stayed between two periods spent in sma.
At the beginning of my first stay, I was extremely lucky to benefit from the crucial practical help of Jean-Pierre Goulard, an anthropologist with three decades
of research experience with Tikuna people, who happened to be doing fieldwork
in the region at the same time. Although I initially had no precise destination, it
quickly became clear to me, when Jean-Pierre generously introduced me in sma,
that it was an excellent working site for my purposes. The main factors that made
me opt for conducting most of my data collection in sma after my first visit there
were the vitality of Tikuna in the community, the ease of access to the village, the
openness of its residents, their comparatively conservative way of life,8 and
the potential access that the community offers to virtually undocumented interfluvial dialects when speakers of these dialects come and stay over for a few
days in sma, usually on their way to Leticia or to other settlements in the valley of
the Amazon. Another important factor was the kindness with which lar and her
family welcomed me in their house, where I lived during all of the 6 months that I
spent in sma itself. By living with them, I had the invaluable opportunity to share
the daily life of a Tikuna family for extended periods of time. Note, incidentally,
that sma is also one of the sites where María Montes, one of the few specialists
This aspect was important to me inasmuch as I was interested, on the long term, in working on
the dialectology and diachrony of Tikuna. It seemed reasonable to tentatively hypothesize, given
the comparatively conservative way of life in sma, that smat might be a comparatively conservative Tikuna variety, which would allow for a more accurate look into the past of Tikuna as a whole.
Indeed, the relatively conservative character of smat is noted by Montes (2005a). First-hand data I
have collected on the Tikuna varieties of the Colombian communities of Nazareth (with an anonymous speaker) and Arara (with Abel Santos), as well as conversations with anonymous speakers
from the Colombian town of Puerto Nariño, likewise confirm that smat is much more conservative
than, minimally, these three varieties.
8391. Introduction
of Tikuna, has conducted most of her linguistic research starting in the mid1980’s, which meant that working myself in sma could provide data that would be
directly comparable with older data collected in the same community.
In the initial stages of my research, the language I used in interactions with
smat speakers was exclusively Spanish. Although I later started to use more and
more smat with them, especially while recording texts and with older speakers
not proficient in Spanish, it proved culturally and politically delicate to switch
entirely to smat for all daily interactions. A few residents of sma, as well as
certain members of other Tikuna communities who happened to come to sma on
occasions, thought of foreigners learning their language as a serious instance of cultural appropriation and suspected my intentions, and those of researchers working
in the area more generally, were to “steal their culture or their language” to make
money out of it back where I was from. Their fears were made all the more acute
if they ever heard me speaking the language, or heard that I spoke it with other
people. This generally discouraged me from speaking smat, especially with people
who were not close collaborators in my project and might not be fully convinced
of its essentially harmless nature. My hope is that the concerns of certain Tikunas
regarding the purposes of my project will ease once I can go back to sma to deliver
its final products to the community.
During part of my stays in sma, I taught free English classes twice a week to
anyone interested. A basic knowledge of spoken English is currently becoming a
very valuable skill in sma for working in the tourism sector. Although the results
of these classes were as a whole limited, one participant in particular, jgs, made
quick progresses which he could directly apply in his professional activity as a
tourist guide.","[44, 45]"

‘gen’ (Allomorph 4)The genitive case-marking suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/, when it is immediately attached to a

distribution of the two irregular forms of /-ãr̀ ǖ/ in this context is essentially subdialectal (with e.g. lar using the form /-ʼrǖ/ and jsg using, optionally, the form

displayed in Table 29 in its three attested subdialectal variants.
The Allomorphs 4 of the first person singular, third person masculine/neuter/non-salientive, and fourth person pronominal roots feature two subdialectal variants each, characterized by either a vowel /o/ or a vowel /a/. Only
the /o/-variants are attested in combination with the variant /-ʼri ̄/ of the genitive

in the other two columns in Table 29 are also frequently—but not always—left
unstressed. Only their stressed phonological forms are provided in this table.
Note, finally, that the form that functions as the Allomorph 4 of the third person salientive pronominal root (/tü̂-mà/) is, in practice, the third person salientive independent pronoun in the zero-case, i.e. a morphologically complex form
that includes the morpheme /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’ (see Section 3.3.3). This form does
not formally align, consequently, with the Allomorphs 4 of the other pronominal
roots, which are morphologically simplex forms. The independent pronouns in the
zero-case corresponding to other person-number-nominal class combinations than
the third person salientive cannot function as Allomorphs 4, i.e. cannot be attached
with the genitive suffix (e.g. */chò-mà-ãr̀ ǖ/ ‘1sg-anaph-gen’ is not a grammatical
alternative for e.g. /chô-ʼrǖ/ ‘my, mine’), while the genitive suffix is otherwise regularly attached to the zero-case form of non-pronominal NPs. This formal misalignment of the third person salientive pronominal root can be interpreted as showing
that it lacks, in fact, an Allomorph 4 proper. Its corresponding zero-case independent pronoun is used to fill this lack by analogy with ordinary NPs, which can,
in their zero-case form, be attached with the genitive suffix (for an exactly parallel discussion regarding the Allomorph 1 of the third person salientive pronominal
root, see Section 3.3.2 above).
2033. The nominal phrase
Combinations of the pronominal roots with the genitive suffix provide independent pronouns in the genitive, which encode pronominal possessors of NPs (by
contrast with pronominal possessors of bound nouns, on the encoding of which see
Section 3.3.2 above). This frequently occurring use of the independent pronouns
in the genitive is shown in the following example:
(141)“[...] chāyā-yâʼu yá kûʼrǖ ócha̋gù [...].”
chā=yā=yâʼuyá=kû-ʼrǖ ócha̋gù1sg.sbj=pci ̄.3m/n/ns.obj=seize lk.m/n/s=2sg-gen dart‘“[...] I’ve caught your dart [...].”’ [jsg B226]
Note that a NP possessed by an independent pronoun in the genitive is not necessarily definite, as shown in (142), or even specific (see also example (196)):
(142)[...] ērü.́ .. wíʼá nȍʼrǖ... cuñauʼü̃̄198 níì-ma̰.

The independent pronouns in the genitive may also occur—although rarely—in
head position, i.e. without the NP they relate to, as in the following example:
(143)Ñùʼ ñâãk̀ ǜ tá-nů yá kûʼrǖ?
ñùʼñâãk̀ ǜtá=nůyá=kû-ʼrǖwhat.activity? in.this.manner 3s.sbj=put.pl lk.m/s=2sg-gen‘[Oh, it seems my cups are not in the same position as yours, while they
should.] How are yours put?’ [jca D80]3.3.6Aspects of the semantics of smat’s
pronominal systemIn most cases, first, second, and third person ordinarily correspond to speaker,
hearer, and any participant that is neither speaker nor hearer, respectively. Second
The form cuñau here stands for Sp. cuñado ‘brother-in-law’ (on the phonological reduction of the
Spanish syllable -ado when it is inserted into a smat utterance by code-mixing, see Section 2.7.2.2).
1982043.3. Pronouns
person singular morphemes, however, are occasionally used without reference to
the hearer. Example (144) illustrates the generic, non-referential human use of
the second person singular. This use is relatively frequent in discourse, although
it largely overlaps with the generic use of the fourth person (compare (155–156)
below).
(144)Wóő chi ́rḛ kūyà-póʼwōē, wóő kū-ãà̄ nè, tåʼúwa̋ kù-pūrākǘgù rǜ, kü̋ tåʼúrűʼü̃̀ tà

[jgs 599–601]
In (145–146), a second person singular refers to precisely identifiable referents
distinct from the hearer. Such uses, by contrast with the generic use of the second
person singular just mentioned, are exceptional and highly marked pragmatically
or stylistically. The second person singular in (145) is used as the semantic equivalent of a first person plural, but invites particular attention on the part of the hearer
(the first sentence of the example could be essentially paraphrased as ‘nobody could
provide us with identity documents, you know!/can you believe that?’).
(145)[...] tèʼe̋ gá... kûʼrǖ pōpērà kű-yăʼűʼè...? Tā-g̃en̊ átǖē.

ear, with whom I transcribed and translated the recording from which this example was extracted, interpreted this utterance as meaning that the speaker was not able to attend school when
she was young because she had no official identity documents, which were needed for that purpose.
Back then, only men had enough practice of the non-indigenous society to know how to obtain such
documents, but because the speaker’s father was dead, she could not get ones in the first place.
1992053. The nominal phrase
[gra 160–161]
The second person singular in (146) is used as the semantic equivalent of a third
person (see also (345) and (T102)). This rare stylistic device seems to be specific
to narrative discourse and to indicate that the process being referred to is sudden
or unexpected.
(146)Ye̊ʼgúmá ãʼ̄ a kū-chi ̊ ãʼ̄ a gá <tèʼè méʼe...> năkǖ!ye̊ʼgúmá=ãʼ̄ akū=chi ̊=ãʼ̄ agá=<tèʼè=méʼe...>năkǖanaph.circ.pst=quot 2sg.sbj=stand=quot lk.f/m/s/ns.pst=what?.m tapir‘[The mythical brothers Yoi and Ipi had all the animals stand in line and
were reviewing them one by one.] And then, here stands the, uh... the
tapir!’ [lar C401–403]
The category I refer to as the first person plural is exclusive: it refers to a
group that is composed of the speaker and one or several third person participants,
but does not normally include the hearer. The enacted speakers in the following
example can therefore only refer to themselves as a first person plural when inviting
a man to follow them (i.e. the speakers to the explicit exclusion of the hearer) to
go fishing:200
(147)“Kǘ tōwe̋ rǖ-ṹ!” ña̋tàgǜgüʼ̋ ü̃́ ãʼ̄ a.

E133]
What I label the fourth person corresponds either 1) to a well-defined inclusive
first person plural (i.e. referring to a group composed of both speaker and hearer,
and possibly one or several third person participants), 2) to a vaguely identified
but referential social group of which the speaker considers themselves as a
A different linguistic perspective on the exact same process could of course have allowed using
a fourth person in its first person plural inclusive meaning in example (600), as in e.g. Let’s go
(poison-fishing) together [you and us]!.

member but that does not necessarily include the hearer, or 3) to a generic, usually singular non-referential human participant (compare the English generic
pronoun one in e.g. One should respect one’s parents at all times).201 It is to underline
its broad semantic range that I have opted for calling this category of the language’s
persons system “fourth person”, instead of e.g. “first person plural inclusive”, which
would have been misleading.202
Examples (148–149) provide occurrences of a fourth person with a first person plural inclusive meaning (see also (T127–T128), which may be contrasted
with (T137–T138) where the exact same referents are referred to as a first person
plural (exclusive)). Note that the plural marking of fourth person participants (e.g.
by means of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ suffixed to an intransitive verb with a fourth person subject
in (148)) is in most cases optional and does not relate to the actual number of individuals subsumed within such participants, which may be two, as in (148), or more
than two, as in (149).

The general syntactic rules stated above do not always apply, however. Causee
arguments in causative constructions based on initially intransitive predicative
phrases may be treated as oblique arguments in the accusative—instead of
core objects, as expected—when specific syntactic and semantic conditions are met,
namely 1) when such causee arguments are represented by a full NP preceding
the predicative phrase and 2) when the corresponding referent is animate. This is
shown in example (427). This additional rule, while optional in most cases, seems
to be obligatory, at least for certain speakers, in the specific case where the causee
argument belongs to the salientive nominal class: contrast the ungrammatical sentence in example (428a) to its corrected form—with the salientive causee argument
in the accusative—in example (428b).

Occurrences of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ in my corpus are rather frequent on initially intransitive predicative phrases, while they are rare on initially transitive predicative phrases. In the latter cases, a causee referent is always morphosyntactically
present, whether as a syntactically explicit NP or as an index procliticized to the
predicative phrase. My data do not allow me to tell whether the causee referent
(which is in this case an oblique complement in the accusative) may be left out from
a causative construction derived from an initially transitive predicative phrase.
The suffix /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ does not alter the predicative class of the predicative
phrases it attaches to. The causative constructions featured in examples (423–
428) above are all based on predicative phrases that initially belong to pcØ and
thus all display derived predicative phrases inflecting in pcØ. The causative constructions in (429) and (430) are based on predicative phrases that initially belong
to pcrǖ and pci ̀, respectively, and therefore display derived predicative phrases
inflecting in these same predicative classes.

The ordering of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ relative to other non-inflectional morphological
components of the predicative phrase seems to generally entail scope effects, with
morphemes preceding /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ usually falling under its scope and morphemes following /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ usually extending their scope over it. This hypothesis requires further
3754. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
research, however, as in many cases such scope effects cannot be easily tested. On
the other hand, the scope relationship between /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ and the feature of associated motion—an inflectional feature in smat, only available in finite forms of
predicative phrases (see Section 5.8)—is grammatically unspecified and its interpretation relies on context. In other words, whether a predicative phrase simultaneously featuring /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ and associated motion is to be interpreted as meaning
‘[cause to [go/come and ...]]’ (involving motion of the causee) or ‘[go/come
and [cause to ...]]’ (involving motion of the causer) is context-dependent.
The following example may thus be interpreted as involving motion of either the
causee or the causer, or even motion of both participants:

baby to sleep.].’
‘I go with him and cause him to sleep [e.g. I walk my drunk husband back
home after a party and put him to bed.].’ [jsg elic.]
My data do not allow me to tell whether the stacking of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’, i.e. the
suffixation of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ to a predicative phrase that already contains an occurrence
of it, is grammatical. Interestingly, however, the antipassivization of a causative
construction in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ by suffixing it with /-tàe/̄ ‘antip3’ is attested, as shown in
the following example:

3764.5. Valency operations
The semantics of causative constructions derived with /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ cover a
very wide array of causation situations.255 Depending on the context, causative
constructions in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ may thus be varyingly translated in English as e.g. ‘cause to
do’ or ‘induce to be’, ‘make do, order to do, force to do’ or ‘allow to do, let do, put
in conditions to do’, etc. In particular, the occurrence of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ is not restricted
to predicative phrases with specific semantic characteristics (e.g. only stative
or only dynamic predicative phrases). Its occurrence does not specify—or is not
constrained by—whether the causee is animate or inanimate (contrast (427) and
(429) respectively), whether it has or does not have control (contrast (426) and
(433)), or whether it is willing or unwilling (contrast (434) and (430)).

As for the causer argument, it may be acting both directly or indirectly (contrast
(427) and (426)). A spontaneous example such as (435), where the causer and
the causee (a reflexive pronoun) are coreferential, as well as the third translation

option for the elicited utterance in example (431), suggest that the causer may be
itself physically involved in the process carried out by the causee, although in most
cases it is not. My data do not, however, allow me to tell whether the causer may
be inanimate (as opposed to animate, which it always is in my data) or whether the
causer’s action may be accidental (as opposed to intentional, which it always is in
may data).

B93]
In one example in my corpus, a causative construction with coreferential causer
and causee arguments (with the latter represented by a reflexive pronoun) is used
to express that the process is artificially simulated (with lit. ‘to cause oneself
to ...’ conveying the meaning of ‘to pretend to ...’). The jaguar who killed the
mythical hero Ngutapa pretends he cannot speak at the moment so as to elude
questions by Ngutapa’s sons:

The /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of the verb root ngǜ ‘rest’—/ngǜ-ʼẽʼ́ e,/ lit. ‘to cause
someone to rest’—has the lexicalized meaning ‘to help (someone)’. The synchronically unanalyzable verb stem g̃ʼŭʼẽʼ́ e ‘to wait for someone’ was most likely historically derived as the /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of a former verb root *g̃ʼŭ no longer
existing in today’s smat.
On the rarer factitive construction, whose functions partially overlap with
those of the causative construction in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/, see the end of the next section.
3784.5. Valency operations4.5.3Valency operations with no dedicated4.5.3.1Passive constructionexponenceIn smat, the more patient-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically
represented as a core object in the transitive construction) may by no means be
omitted from an utterance without the simultaneous addition of dedicated derivational morphology to the predicative phrase (on the antipassive suffixes /-ètà/, /-ē/
and /-tàe/̄ , which allow such an omission, see Section 4.5.1). By contrast, the more
agent-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically represented as a subject
in the transitive construction) may be omitted from an utterance without the addition of any specific derivational morphology to the predicative phrase. When this
occurs, the predicate merely becomes intransitive and the more patient-like
argument is promoted to the syntactic function of subject, i.e. the only core
argument position left in the resulting utterance. I call “passive construction” this
intransitive use of typically transitive predicative phrases with no derivational morphology involved. Contrast the ordinary transitive construction in example (437a),
where both agent and patient referents are overtly mentioned, with the passive
construction in (437b), where only the patient referent is retained:

Examples (438a) and (438b) illustrate the exact same contrast in spontaneous textual examples:

Examples (439) and (440) feature both a passive construction and an ordinary transitive construction involving the same verb, specifically the verb root wü̏ ‘to scratch,
to write’ in (439) (with the passive construction coming first and the transitive construction coming next) and the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down (smaller trees)’ in (440)
(with the two constructions occurring in the reverse order; note that the verb root
tūʼu ‘to fell (bigger trees)’ at the end of (440) also appears in a passive construction):

The passive construction in smat does not seem to allow for the overt expression of an agent participant (e.g. as an oblique equivalent to English ‘by ...’).
The passive construction does not affect the predicative class of the predicative phrase it is applied to. In examples (438a) and (438b) above, for instance,
the predicative phrase /g̃ü̊-ègù/ (slant?-inv) ‘to flip over’ is inflected in the predicative class pcØ in both its ordinary transitive and its passive uses. Similarly, in
the following example, /då-yé/ (chop-in.the.middle) ‘to cut in halves’ is inflected in
pci ̄ in a passive construction, in the same way as when it occurs in a transitive construction256 (compare also the two occurrences of the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down’
in (440), which both feature pci ̄ inflection):

Although the passive construction gets a stative-resultative reading in most
of its uses, this Aktionsart feature is only implied as a tendency rather than being
intrinsic to that construction. The following example displays a case of passive
construction with a telic reading, which is evidenced by the presence of an adjunct
providing a punctual temporal reference for the event referred to:257

intransitively and transitively derives from a specific lexical property of that predicative phrase, namely its lability, and 2) that there is no directionality of any kind
between the intransitive uses and the transitive uses of such predicative phrases,
which tend to indiscriminately occur in both intransitive and transitive constructions. However, although the passive construction is in practice relatively rare in
discourse, it seems that at least a vast majority of transitive predicative phrases may
be submitted to it. Its high productivity inclines me to treat it as a morphosyntactic construction typically available to any transitive predicative phrase, rather than
as an alternative use of particular predicative phrases allowed by specific properties
of the latter. On the other hand, predicative phrases that may occur in the passive construction are in practice used transitively in the vast majority of their
occurrences in discourse. This significant differential in frequency between transitive (frequent) and passive (rare) uses of these predicative phrases suggests some
sort of directionality between the two uses, with transitive uses being more primary and passive uses being more secondary. This is why I have opted for treating
the passive construction as a morphosyntactic operation that derives intransitive
constructions from predicative phrases that are intrinsically transitive.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388]"
"On the other hand, the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is typically deactivated in
ordinary conversation with reference to recent past, present, or future processes,
i.e. any time the processes referred to are tightly related to the utterance situation
and their temporal order is deemed irrelevant or contextually obvious. Predicative
phrases in declarative main clauses then tend to all be inflected in ind. Ind is
also virtually systematic in non-temporally-ordered descriptions of events, e.g. in a
description of the various activities one carries out or may carry out (in any order)
on a given occasion or more generally in one’s daily life. Crucially, ind is also the
default Inflectional Type for predicative phrases in declarative main clauses
elicited from speakers out of context.
Examples (449–453) illustrate uses of ind in contexts where it does not contrast with sbjv-ʼü̃́. Examples (449–451), firstly, exemplify the default use of ind
in daily conversation strongly anchored in the utterance situation (for a good
understanding of the examples in this section, recall that the glosses of predicative
phrases in ind do not comprise the explicit mention ‘ind’, by contrast with those
of predicative phrases in sbjv(-ʼü̃́), which comprise the mention ‘sbjv’):

‘This was, and ...’; “summary linkage” in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These formulaic (or
generic) recapitulating clauses often—but not always—provide linkage not between sentences, but
between entire paragraphs of discourse and not infrequently involve a temporal gap between the
two (sequences of) processes referred to (see e.g. (T7) and (T38)). Occasionally, both a formulaic
and a verbatim recapitulating clauses occur consecutively (as in e.g. (T136), where it could be that a
paragraph break is implied by the formulaic recapitulating clause, while actual temporal contiguity
between the preceding and the new paragraph is highlighted by the verbatim recapitulating clause).
For typological discussions and case studies of the use of specific or generic recapitulation clauses
for discursive purposes—a strategy referred to as “tail-head linkage” or “bridge linkage”, among
others—see Guillaume (2011) and Aikhenvald (2019).",[407]
"4.2.5Incorporating nominals to the verb root or
verb stemIncorporation233 in smat is a morphosyntactic strategy that has the effect of
integrating into a verb root or a verb stem a nominal constituent (whether
a bound noun or an NP) that could in principle be alternatively expressed as
(part of) a syntactically independent main constituent of the clause. The resulting incorporating verb stem or verb phrase is a verbal PP and may, as such, be
subject to incorporation (recursively, although this only marginally occurs) and to
the derivational morphology of the PP. Incorporation forces the integrated nominal
constituent to occur in a rigid morphosyntactic configuration relative to the verb
root or verb stem. It additionally prevents it from featuring any syntactic-function
marking. The pragmatic effect of incorporation can be roughly characterized as
that of decreasing, to varying degrees, the discourse salience of the referent
corresponding to the incorporated nominal constituent. Incorporation is a highfrequency phenomenon in smat discourse.
Contrast the essentially parallel examples (324) and (325). In (324), the constituent chàuchíʼü̃̀ ‘my house’ in not incorporated but occurs instead as a main constituent of the clause, with the effect of leaving it salient in the context. The
speaker is not simply stating that he is building a house, but stressing that he is eventually building a house of his own, after living with his parents-in-law for years.

The analysis of incorporation in smat proposed in this section is mostly inspired by Creissels
(2006a, 2016) and Aikhenvald (2007).
2333164.2. Verbal predicative phrases
In (325), by contrast, the referent ‘house’ is expressed as a constituent incorporated to the verb root ü̆ ‘to make’ (in this case, via the formal type of incorporation that I call bound noun incorporation; see next section). The speaker here is
not talking about a particular house, but simply referring to the general activity of
building a house, a well-recognized one in Tikuna culture.

Contrast, likewise, example (326) with (327), which features a formally distinct
but functionally parallel type of incorporation (which I call NP incorporation; see
below). In the former example, the enacted speaker is having a curious idea for
the first time, that of taking his own stomach out so as to be able to drink more
manioc beer. He expresses it in a main clause. To make it absolutely clear that he is
indeed thinking about this strange idea of removing his own stomach from his own
belly by himself, he refers to his stomach, whose identification is crucial in the
context, as a separate syntactic constituent (chôʼrǖ tüè̂ ‘my (own) stomach’).

In example (327), by contrast, the same project is now referred to within a subordinate clause, the general point of the utterance now being to imagine the potential
consequences of the hypothesis being considered (‘If I do that, then ...’). The identification of the stomach now being well-established and therefore of less discursive

proceeds to expound the three functional uses for which these two formal types
are employed, specifically core argument incorporation, possessee incorporation,
and non-core participant incorporation. Section 4.2.5.3 finally discusses the use
of pseudo-incorporation in possessive predication, i.e. constructions that are
formally identical with bound noun or NP incorporation but do not correspond
functionally to any of the three uses of genuine incorporation identified in Section 4.2.5.2.","[321, 322, 323]"

class pci ̄ or pci ̀ in sbjv, contrasted with their expected (but rarely attested or unattested)
concatenative formsnations that affect the last syllable of the predicative phrase remain as unambiguous
phonological exponents of the predicative phrase’s Inflectional Type. Contrast, for
instance, the ind predicative phrase /tā=nā=fè/ (1pl.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot)
‘we shot it’ with its corresponding sbjv form /tā=nā=fʼĕ/ (1pl.sbj(.sbjv)=
3m/n/ns.obj=shoot\sbjv) ‘we killed it’. In practice, the latter only differs from
the former by the effect of sbjv’s morphotonological alternations affecting the last
(and in this case, single) syllable of the predicative phrase (in this case, fè with /21 /
in ind turns into fʼĕ with /CM / in sbjv).
Note that, in sbjv just like in ind (see Section 5.3.2), in cases where a subject
index in slot 4 should immediately precede (i.e. with no intervening morpheme
/yà=/ ‘am’ in slot 5) the predicative class markers /i ̄=/ ‘pci ̄’ or /i ̀=/ ‘pci ̀’ from
slot 6, a phonological reduction of the vowel of the subject index regularly occurs
(see columns pci ̄ and pci ̀ in Chart J on p.452). Because in most cases the resulting
morphemes arise from the fusion of a morpheme in slot 4 that features sbjv’s imposed toneme /1 /, instead of featuring its lexical toneme as in ind, these resulting
morphemes are slightly different from the 4+6 fusional morphemes occurring in
ind. Table 46 provides a list of the 4+6 fusional morphemes as they occur in
sbjv (this table is to be contrasted with Table 43 above, on which it is modeled).
Simpler case 2: a third person subject is expressed as a NP (last row
in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). An additional, easily described complication
occurs in sbjv in cases where a third person subject argument is expressed as a
clause-internal syntactically independent NP that precedes the predicative phrase.
In such contexts, a predicative phrase inflected in ind maintains its indexation of
4405.5. Inflection in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (slots 4–8)
the subject argument in slot 4.270 By contrast, a predicative phrase inflected in
sbjv does not, in such contexts, feature any indexation of the subject argument in slot 4. As a consequence, the toneme /1 / characteristic of sbjv cannot
be imposed to a proclitic belonging in slot 4 (in the absence of any such morpheme). In this situation, sbjv’s toneme /1 / is simply not realized, and the
combinations of proclitics that obtain are identical to those found in ind, except
that they lack any material in slot 4 (note that in practice, this makes the combinations of proclitics that occur in sbjv in this specific situation identical for the
most part to those found in imp, which are likewise mostly identical to those found
in ind except that they lack any material in slot 4; see the preceding section).
The morphotonological alternations that affect the last syllable of the predicative
phrase in sbjv maintain, for their part, their usual effect. Contrast, for instance, the
clause in ind /Juan ná=pé/ (John 3m/n/ns.sbj=sleep) ‘John slept’ with the corresponding clause in sbjv /Juan pê/ (John sleep\sbjv) ‘(that) John slept’. While
the predicative phrase in the former clause obligatorily indexes the subject argument already expressed as a NP preceding it, no such indexation occurs within the
predicative phrase of the latter clause. The predicative phrase in sbjv additionally features the effect of sbjv’s morphotonological alternations (with pé in ind
→ pê in sbjv). Contrast, likewise, the clause in ind /Juan ná=yà=ma̰/ (John
3m/n/ns.sbj=pci ̀.3m/n/ns.obj=kill.sg) ‘John killed it’ with the corresponding
clause in sbjv /Juan yà=ma̋/ (John pci ̀.3m/n/ns.obj=kill.sg\sbjv) ‘(that) John
killed it’.
Much more intricate complications occur in sbjv in cases where a third
person feminine/masculine/neuter/non-salientive (f/m/n/ns) subject argument (not expressed within the clause as a NP preceding the predicative phrase)
or a fourth person argument are to be indexed on the predicative phrase. These
complications arise from the fact that slot 4 in sbjv does not feature indexes
for such subjects (while it does feature indexes for them in ind). The indexation
of such subjects therefore has to operate via other strategies than straightforward
encoding in slot 4.271
This process of “indexation” could in fact be better characterized as a case of agreement for
subject argument, given that it indexes a participant already expressed syntactically in the clause.
270Interestingly, certain speakers (e.g. jgs, lar, igv) occasionally produce analogical forms in
sbjv with a third person f/m/n/ns subject index that aligns with the straightforward cases of encoding of subject indexes in slot 4 in sbjv discussed in the preceding paragraphs, e.g. /nà4 =rǖ6 =ngǜgü̋-ʼǘ̃/ (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest-pl\sbjv-sub) ‘they rested’ (on the model of the straightforward /tà4 =rǖ6 =ngǜ-gü̋-ʼü̃́/ [3s.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest-pl\sbjv-sub] ‘they rested’) instead of the
2714415. Inflection of the predicative phrase
The strategies employed for indexing a third person f/m/n/ns subject in sbjv
differ from those employed for encoding a fourth person subject.
Complex case 1: indexation of a third person subject in slot 7 (fifth
and sixth rows in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). Third person f/m/n/ns
subjects in sbjv are encoded in slot 7, i.e. in the slot dedicated to the encoding of
third person m/n/ns (core) objects in ind, and their exponents are segmentally
(but not always tonologically) identical to those that encode third person
m/n/ns objects in ind.272 In other words, the morphological material occurring
in slot 7 in ind, although it happens to only serve for the encoding of third person m/n/ns object indexes in ind (given that subjects are always indexed in slot 4
in ind),273 essentially encodes a third person f/m/n/ns index, whether subject or
object, which is why the exact same material is found to occur in sbjv for the encoding of third person f/m/n/ns subject indexes. Portmanteau proclitics in sbjv
that simultaneously encode a third person f/m/n/ns subject index in slot 7 together
with features from slots 5 (associated motion) or 6 (predicative class) are likewise
segmentally (but not always tonologically) identical to those that simultaneously
encode in ind a third person m/n/ns object index in slot 7 together with features
from slots 5 or 6. The reason why all these morphemes encoding a f/m/n/ns subregular but more opaque /nà6+7 =ngǜ-gü̋-ʼü̃́/ [pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=rest-pl\sbjv-sub] ‘they
rested’ (subscript numbers in these forms correspond to the slots filled by the respective morphemes;
for an instance of this phenomenon in context, see (T109)). I take such analogical forms as an indication that the system of encoding of third person f/m/n/ns subject indexes in sbjv proves opaque
to speakers themselves, to the point of prompting unconscious “repairs” from them.
This formal identity suffers a single exception. While the morpheme that simultaneously encodes pci ̀ and a third person m/n/ns object index in ind has the phonological form /yà=/, the
one that simultaneously encodes pci ̀ and a third person f/m/n/ns subject index in sbjv virtually
always takes the phonological form /yi ̀=/ (or even /yi ̰=/, instead of the expected /yà=/) in the
specific case where it is combined with the high-frequency verb root i ̃̊ ‘to be’ (yielding the predicative phrase /yi ̀=i/̃̀ [pci ̀.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv=be\sbjv] ‘(that) he/she/it is’). For a similar case of
assimilation for vowel quality of an /a/ with the nucleus /i/ of i ̃̊ ‘to be’, see the case of the irregular
realization /i ̄yi ̀=/ of the proclitic /i ̄yà=/ ‘3f.sbj.pci ̀’ in Section 5.3.2.
272Note, additionally, that the reason why the morphemes that fill slot 7 in ind never stand for
a third person f object but only for third person m/n/ns objects (while the same morphemes in
ind may stand for both third person m/n/ns and f subjects) is because third person f participants
in (core) object syntactic position are in practice always encoded, via a phenomenon of differential
object marking, as participants in the accusative. Such participants, when indexed on the predicative
phrase, systematically occupy slot 2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase, and never
slot 7.
2734425.5. Inflection in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (slots 4–8)
ject index in slot 7 (potentially along with other features from slots 5 or 6) in sbjv
are not always tonologically identical (although they are segmentally) with those
that encode a m/n/ns object index in slot 7 (again, potentially along with other
features) in ind, is that they undergo the imposition of sbjv’s characteristic
toneme /1 / in cases where the third person subject index being encoded corresponds to a m/n/ns participant (by contrast with a f participant). However,
sbjv’s toneme /1 / is not imposed to these morphemes in cases where the third person subject index being encoded corresponds to a f participant, which is how a third
person m/n/ns subject index may be distinguished from a third person f subject
index.
Examples (503–505) illustrate what was just said in the preceding paragraph
(the subscript numbers to the right of the morphemes in these examples correspond
to the slots of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase that the respective
morphemes fill). Example (503) shows that the same form /nā=/ in slot 7 that
serves for the encoding of a third person m/n/ns object in ind (as in (503a), where
it is glossed as ‘3m/n/ns.obj’) may serve in sbjv for the encoding of a third person
f subject, with no tonological modification (as in (503b), where it is glossed as
‘3f.sbj.sbjv’). The same morpheme, if affected by sbjv’s toneme imposition of
/1 /, may serve in sbjv for the encoding of a third person m/n/ns subject (as in
(503c), where it is glossed as ‘3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv’).
(503)a. chā4 =nā7 =ngo̰1sg.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=bite‘I bit it’b. nā7 =pê3f.sbj.sbjv=sleep\sbjv‘(that) she slept’c. nà7 =pê3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=sleep\sbjv‘(that) he slept’Example (504) similarly shows that the same form /yà=/ in slots 5+7 that contributes the encoding of a third person m/n/ns object in ind (as in (504a), where it
is glossed as ‘am.3m/n/ns.obj’) may contribute in sbjv the encoding of a third person f/m/n/ns subject (as in (504b), where it is glossed as ‘am.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv’).
Note that in this case, by contrast with the case just discussed in the preceding example, because the form /yà=/ already features a lexical toneme /1 /, the encodings
of a third person f vs a third person m/n/ns subject index cannot be distinguished
4435. Inflection of the predicative phrase
by the imposition of sbjv’s toneme /1 / for the encoding of the latter.
(504)a. chā4 =yà5+7 =ngo̰1sg.sbj=am.3m/n/ns.obj=bite‘I went and bit it’b. yà5+7 =pêam.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv=sleep\sbjv‘(that) she/he slept’Example (505) shows an additional case of the same phenomenon. The form /nā=/
in slots 6+7, which contributes the encoding of a third person m/n/ns object in
ind (as in (505a)), may contribute in sbjv the encoding of a third person f subject
index (as in (505b), where the form’s toneme is left unchanged) or a third person
m/n/ns subject index (as in (505c), where the form is imposed sbjv’s toneme /1 /).
(505)a. chā4 =yà5 =nā6+7 =ngǜ-ʼẽʼ́ e1sg.sbj=am=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.obj=rest-caus‘I went and made him rest’
b. yà5 =nā6+7 =ngʼü̆am=pcrǖ.3f.sbj.sbjv=rest\sbjv‘(that) she went and rested’
c. yà5 =nà6+7 =ngʼü̆am=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=rest\sbjv‘(that) he went and rested’Incidentally, the indexation of a f/m/n/ns subject in sbjv, because it occupies
slot 7, forces the indexation of third person m/n/ns objects (when present)
out of slot 7 (see fifth and sixth rows in Charts K and M on pp.452–453). From a
functional perspective, this can be said to be the reason why the inflectional template of the predicative phrase in sbjv features an extra slot 8 (at the right edge
of the predicative phrase) compared to the inflectional templates of the predicative
phrase in ind or imp. The only function of this extra slot 8 is to encode a third person m/n/ns object index (by means of a suffix /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’) in cases where
slot 7 is already filled by the encoding of a third person f/m/n/ns subject (note that
whenever slot 7 is available, however, the indexation of a third person m/n/ns object in sbjv operates, by default, in slot 7). Contrast, for instance, the ind predicative phrase /ná4 =nā7 =ngo̰/ (3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=bite) ‘he ate it’ with
its corresponding sbjv predicative phrase /nà7 =ngő-ã̀8 / (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=
bite\sbjv-3m/n/ns.obj) ‘(that) he ate it’. Because in the sbjv predicative phrase
4445.5. Inflection in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (slots 4–8)
slot 7 is occupied by the indexation of a third person m/n/ns subject, the third person m/n/ns object index encoded in slot 7 in the ind predicative phrase is forced
out of it into slot 8 in the sbjv predicative phrase.
Complex case 2: “negative indexation” of a fourth person subject
(second-to-last row in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). Fourth person subjects in sbjv can be said to be encoded negatively. It is the absence of any subject
marking in slots 4 or 7, combined with the absence of any NP in subject position preceding the predicative phrase, that is interpreted as implying that the predicative
phrase has a fourth person subject. Fourth person subjects in sbjv are represented morphologically—so to say—as an absence of subject. When “indexation” of a fourth person subject occurs in sbjv, the last of the proclitics that
precede the predicative phrase is systematically imposed sbjv’s toneme /1 /
(which may, as in other cases discussed in this section, result in no change if the
last proclitic’s lexical toneme, i.e. the one it features in ind, is already /1 /).
Contrast the predicative phrase in ind /ti ́i ̄=déʼà-gǘ/ (4sbj.pci ̄=speak-pl) ‘we
(incl.) spoke’ (with /ti ́i ̄=/ < /tá=i ̄=/ ‘4sbj=pci ̄=’; see Table 43) with the
corresponding predicative phrase in sbjv /i ̀=déʼà-gü̋/ (pci ̄\sbjv=speak-pl\sbjv)
‘(that) we (incl.) spoke’. The latter differs from the former in that it completely
lacks—from a formal perspective—a subject, and in that its last (and only) proclitic
(/i ̀=/ ‘pci ̄\sbjv’) features sbjv’s imposed toneme /1 / (by contrast with /i ̄=/ ‘pci ̄’
in the ind predicative phrase, which features its lexical toneme /3 /). Contrast, likewise, the predicative phrase in ind /tá=yà=rǖ=ngǜ-gǘ/ (4sbj=am=pcrǖ=restpl) ‘we (incl.) went and rested’ with the corresponding predicative phrase in sbjv
/yà=rǜ=ngǜ-gü̋/ (am=pcrǖ\sbjv=rest-pl\sbjv) ‘(that) we (incl.) went and
rested’. Again, the latter differs from the former in that it completely lacks a subject,
and in that the last morpheme in its chain of proclitics (/rǜ=/ ‘pcrǖ\sbjv’) features
sbjv’s imposed toneme /1 / (by contrast with /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ in the ind predicative
phrase, which features its lexical toneme /3 /). Finally, contrast in the same way
the predicative phrase in ind /tá=yà=pé-gǘ/ (4sbj=am=sleep-pl) ‘we (incl.)
went and slept’ with the corresponding predicative phrase in sbjv /yà=pé-gü̋/
(am.sbjv=sleep-pl\sbjv) ‘(that) we (incl.) went and slept’. Note, in this last example, that the form /yà=/, which already features a lexical toneme /1 /, remains
tonologically unchanged from the ind predicative phrase to the sbjv predicative
phrase.
Note, finally, an exception that occurs in pcØ predicative phrases in sbjv with a
fourth person subject, in cases where neither associated motion nor a third person
4455. Inflection of the predicative phrase
m/n/ns object index are encoded within the predicative phrase (see second-to-last
row of the first column of Chart J on p.452). Given an ind predicative phrase
/tá=pé-gǘ/ (4sbj=sleep-pl) ‘we (incl.) slept’, one might expect its corresponding
sbjv predicative phrase to be */pé-gü̋/, i.e. to lack any proclitic, as per the principles put forward in the preceding paragraph. In this specific situation, however,
and probably so as to avoid the complete lack of inflectional marking in the predicative phrase, an ad hoc pcØ marker /i ̀=/ ‘pcø.sbjv’ “fills” the lack of proclitics, yielding in this case a sbjv predicative phrase /i ̀=pé-gü̋/ (pcø.sbjv=sleeppl\sbjv) ‘(that) we (incl.) slept’ (for a similar case of “filler” pcØ marker occurring
in the inflectional morphology of imp, see the discussion of /nà=/ ‘pcø.imp’ in
Section 5.4). The form of this morpheme might indicate that it represents historically an extension of the regular predicative class markers /i ̄=/ and /i ̀=/ of pci ̄
and pci ̀ respectively (which both acquire the form /i ̀=/ under the effect of sbjv’s
toneme /1 / imposition) into the inflectional morphology of pcØ.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451]"

obligatorily, the collective suffix /-tá/ (/dăa-̰̃ tá, yi ̆ã-̰ tá, gŭa-̰̃ tá/).
In most of its occurrences, the proximal exophoric demonstrative is used in reference to an item at least partially located within the immediate reach of the
speaker, or an item they are holding. In example (162), the NP ñåà libro ‘this
booklet’ refers to a booklet that the speaker is holding with one hand at utterance
time and at which he is simultaneously pointing with the other hand.

In (160) above, the woman referred to with the feminine proximal exophoric /ñáà/ is implied (the example stems from a narrative) to be standing right next to the
speaker. In (159) above, when referring to dâà comunidad ‘this community’, with
the neuter proximal exophoric /dâ-à/, the speaker is pointing all around him with
a circular gesture outlining a space that includes the spot where he sits.
The medial exophoric demonstrative is typically used in reference to an element located relatively close to the speaker, without being within their immediate reach. Note that the medial demonstratives generally do not seem to
specify distance relative to the hearer, i.e. their referent may be located at a certain distance from both speaker and hearer and is not necessarily located close to
the hearer. Finally, the distal exophoric demonstrative typically indicates that the
referent is located far from the speaker but within their eyesight. In example
(163), the speaker first refers to a man located a dozen of meters away from her
(/gŭ-à/ ‘dist.m-exo’), and then to a woman located a few meters away from both
her and the hearer (/ngé-à/ ‘med.f-exo’). In both cases, the speaker simultaneously
points at the referent with one hand.

(Section 3.3), the system of non-locative demonstratives (Section 3.4), and
the morphosyntax of the unique linker morpheme of the language (Section 3.5).

functions of NPs (Section 3.6).","[184, 185, 186, 187]"
"1742.9. Practical orthography
is realized [1 ]. Out of context, i.e. in the lexical representation of morphemes, the
toneme /4/1 / is represented as <x̽>, i.e. with a combination of the diacritics <x́>
and <x̀> (which stand for /4 / and /1 / respectively; e.g. <-ʼgu̽> /-ʔgu4/1 / ‘circ’).
Note that the toneme /CM /, <ʼx̆>, is represented with a combination of an
apostrophe <ʼ> with the diacritic <x̆> that would otherwise stand for /22 / (remember that /CM / has merged into /22 / in most younger speakers; see Section 2.4.1,
p.97).
As a rule, syntactic words are separated by spaces. Most clitics, in particular, are thus detached from their host (e.g. <chòmà rǜ> /ʨo21 -∼ba4/1 =dɯ1 /
[ˈʨo̞ː21 mã1 ɾɯ1 ] ‘(as for) me’). However, a hyphen <-> is specifically used to signal the boundary between the (string of) proclitics of the predicative phrase (which
among themselves are not separated by spaces) and their host (e.g. <nüc̄ hā-dău>
/∼dɯ3 =ʨa3 =dau22 / [nɯ̃ 3 ʨa3 ˈd̪a͡ʊ22 ] ‘I see it’).
Apart from the representation of the toneme /4/1 / in context—which does not
distinguish it from /4 / or /1 /—the only phonological ambiguity of this practical orthography is to do with stress, which is not systematically represented.
However, stressed syntactic words—which always bear stress on their first graphic
syllable—may be detected through an array of graphic clues such as the presence in
their first graphic syllable of graphemes occurring only in stressed syllables (<ai,
au, ãi, ãu, d, f, g̃, ng, w̃ , x̏, x̊, x̂, x̆, ʼx̆>), or the presence of a hyphen <->, which
always immediately precedes a stressed word. In cases where such clues are absent,
knowledge of the limited number of unstressed morphemes of the language is usually enough to easily deduce which words are stressed or unstressed. In exceptional
cases, a basic understanding of the language’s morphosyntax should easily resolve
any remaining ambiguities regarding the presence or absence of stress.
The way the presence or absence of stress, as well as its position, can be
indirectly detected in this practical orthographic transcription is illustrated
in example (132). This example is repeated from (20) with the addition of its
orthographic transcription (first line; the word-by-word gloss is not repeated here
and the phonetic transcription line represents a careful pronunciation rather than
the actual recorded pronunciation of this utterance, which is why it slightly differs
from the phonetic line in (20)).

The first graphic word in (132) is known to be stressed (on its first syllable, as always) because its first syllable features the grapheme <ng>, which only occurs
in stressed syllables. This implies, in passing, that the tonological diacritic <x̄>
in <Ngē> is to be interpreted as representing /33 / (value of <x̄> in stressed syllables), not /3 / (value of <x̄> in unstressed syllables; see Table 22). The sequences <ni ́i ̀> and <chà> in the second and third graphic words are known to
be unstressed, and more specifically to be proclitics of the predicative head, since
they are followed by hyphens <->. These hyphens also indicate that the syntac̆ úchi ̋ʼüʼ̀ ü̃́>, which follow them, are stressed (on their first
tic words <i ̃̊> and <ük
syllable). The tonological diacritics in the first syllables of these two words are
unambiguous; because they only occur in stressed syllables, they contribute to indicate that the syllable they belong to is stressed. The second to last graphic word
<i ̀> stands for the non-salientive inflectional form /i1 =/ of the pervasive linker
proclitic, and is therefore unstressed. Although it could in theory represent a (nonexistent) stressed morpheme */ʔi21 /, in practice the risk of ambiguity is nil. Finally,
no graphic clue signals the stressed nature of the last graphic word <chòmà>. Because the language features no unstressed morpheme with this shape, however, it
is easily deduced to be stressed (on its first syllable), which implies that the value
of its first tonological diacritic <x̀> is /21 / (value of <x̀> in stressed syllables),
not /1 / (value of <x̀> in unstressed syllables).
Slight non-phonological intra-dialectal variations, such as those described in
Section 2.1 in particular, are not reflected in the practical orthography (e.g. /kʷ/
is represented as <f > whether realized [kʷ] or [ɸʷ]). In cases where a morpheme has two phonological variants and one of them is obviously analyzable
as secondarily derived from the other, that morpheme is always represented according to its more conservative variant (e.g. <fènǖe ̄> for both the conservative
variant /kʷe21 ∼dɯ3 e3 / [ˈɸʷe̞ː21 nɯ̃ 3 ẽ̞3 ] and the innovative variant /kʷe21 ∼de3 e3 /
[ˈɸʷe̞ː21 nẽ̞3 ẽ̞3 ], both meaning ‘to hunt’). When no obvious derivation relationship
is detectable between two phonological variants of a morpheme, the two variants
are faithfully represented (e.g. <ãʼ̄ a> for /=∼ʔaʔ3 / [...ʔã3 ʔã1 ] but <ũʼ̄ à> for
/=∼ʔu3 ∼ʔa1 / [...ʔũ3 ʔã1 ], both being variants of the quotative enclitic).
Spanish words inserted in a smat utterance by code-mixing are written in italics and following Spanish standards (in particular, the tonemes that such words are

of diacritic marking that I propose here should be discussed and tested with smat
speakers to assess the viability of such a system for wider uses.","[179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"
"4.2.5.1Formal typesFrom a strictly morphological perspective, incorporation in smat corresponds
to two different constructions, bound noun incorporation and NP incorporation.
(i) Bound noun incorporation Bound noun incorporation, a very frequent construction, allows a bound noun (alone, i.e. without the stressed morpheme or stem to which it would necessarily have been attached to occur as a free
syntactic constituent of the main clause in discourse) to be directly attached to
the right edge of a verb root or a verb stem. Because bound nouns are (invariably) unstressed forms in smat, the resulting incorporating verb stem constitutes a
single phonological word.
Illustrations of bound noun incorporation are given in example (328) (on the
identification of the syntactico-semantic types of incorporation provided in parentheses, see next section). Note that certain bound nouns belong to a lexical class of
bound morphemes that cause the morphotonological alternations /43 /→/31 / and
3184. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
.............................-ãr̀ ǖ .....-ã̰
verb.root/stem-gen NP-poss
In NP incorporation, the incorporated nominal constituent (which, as a well-formed
NP, necessarily bears a stress on its first syllable) retains its stress and consequently constitutes its own phonological word (or several phonological words,
in exceptional cases where the incorporated NP is syntactically complex) together
with the unstressed possessive suffix /-ã/̰ that it bears at its right edge.
Instances of the NP incorporation construction are provided in examples (329–
330) (see also (327) above; these three examples all involve incorporation of the
possessee incorporation functional type, on which see next section). Note that the
suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/ gen belongs to the lexical class of bound morphemes that trigger
the Pattern 2 morphotonological alternations mentioned in the preceding paragraph (hence the forms /mê-ãr̀ ǖ/ [be.good-gen], from mé ‘be good’, in (329) and
/i ̋-ãr̀ ǖ/ [be.small-gen], from i ̰ ‘be small’, in (330)).

223]
The NP incorporation construction is the only one in smat to derive PPs made
of two or more phonological words. It is mostly attested in a single one of the
three syntactico-semantic types of incorporation identified in the following section,
specifically the one I call possessee incorporation.
3204.2. Verbal predicative phrases4.2.5.2Functional typesFrom a syntactic and semantic perspective, I distinguish three major types of
incorporation in smat: core argument incorporation, possessee incorporation,
and non-core participant incorporation.
(i) Core argument incorporation In core argument incorporation, the
semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to the semantic role of
the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object of a transitive verb
root/stem. The subject syntactic position of the intransitive verb root/stem, or the
object syntactic position of the transitive verb root/stem, is “absorbed” by the incorporated constituent. Core argument incorporation consequently decreases the
valency of the verb root/stem: an intransitive one becomes avalent (rare), a transitive one becomes intransitive. Core argument incorporation mostly incorporates
bound nouns (instead of entire NPs, but see (335)).
Only the bound noun /-ànè/ ‘space (i.e. land or sky)’ is attested in my data
to occur as an incorporated bound noun absorbing the subject position of an
intransitive verb root/stem (subject-absorbing incorporation is not attested at all
with an NP as the incorporated constituent). The resulting impersonal incorporating verb stem takes an expletive third person (non-salientive?) subject234 and
denotes a terrain condition (as in (331); see also (T30)), a weather condition (as in
(T105)), or a sky condition corresponding to a specific moment of day or night (as
in (332)235 ).

impersonal verb stem incorporating a subject-absorbing /-ànè/, seems to take ãē̄ màkǖ ‘lightning’ as
its subject.
234Although synchronically unanalyzable, the impersonal verb stem yâànè ‘be twilight’ in (332)
clearly features a fully-lexicalized instance of subject-absorbing incorporation of /-ànè/‘space’.

back to the village.] We arrive at twilight, at the very end of the afternoon
[lit. ‘... really when the sky is green.’?].’ [jgs 72]
Incidentally, the only cases in my data where (genuine) incorporation is applied twice within a single verb stem involve, as a second step, subject-absorbing
incorporation of /-ànè/ ‘space’ (for a case of a verb stem displaying both possessive pseudo-incorporation and possessee incorporation, see example (345)). Thus,
/nà=tá-chi ̋kà-ànē-ʼǘ̃/ (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=be.big-room-space\sbjv-sub) ‘there
was a lot of room’ in (333) can be analyzed as featuring, first, a case of possessee
incorporation (‘[the room]POSSESSEE of the space is big’>‘the space is [room]-big’; on
possessee incorporation, see below) followed by a case of core argument incorporation absorbing a subject syntactic position (‘[the space]SBJ is room-big’>‘itEXPLETIVE
is [space]-room-big’).

With bound nouns or NPs absorbing the object position of a transitive verb
root/stem, core argument incorporation usually produces verb stems/phrases that
denote relatively well-identified activities regularly practiced in Tikuna culture, as
in example (334) (see also (325) above, and tà-ãʼ̆ pàèʼü̃́ ‘they twisted chambira fiber’
in (T82) and ti ̄-düĝ ùnègüʼ̋ ü̃́ ‘they sharpened darts’ in (T83)).

creatures were playing in a river.] The hunter silently leaned his blowgun
against [a tree] and watched them.’ [gsg 1’37”–1’44”]
(ii) Possessee incorporation In possessee incorporation, the semantic role
of the incorporated constituent corresponds, like in core argument incorporation, to
the semantic role of the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object
of a transitive verb root/stem. Possessee incorporation may also occasionally occur in cases where the semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to
that of the complement in the accusative of an intransitive verb root/stem. However, unlike in core argument incorporation, no valency decrease occurs. The
subject, object, or accusative complement syntactic position—respectively—is not
absorbed by the incorporated constituent, but is instead occupied by a participant
that corresponds semantically to the possessor of the incorporated constituent.
3234. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
Thus, in possessee incorporation, the syntactic valency of the verb root/stem remains unchanged, but the mapping of its syntactic valency onto semantic roles is
reorganized. In the case of a transitive verb root/stem, for instance, the presence
of possessee incorporation implies that the participant in object position is not the
patient, but the possessor of the patient, which is itself expressed as the incorporated constituent. Possessee incorporation allows a semantic possessor to be
promoted to the syntactic position of its possessee and, as a result, to benefit
from an increase in discursive salience, in particular over its possessee. Like core
argument incorporation, possessee incorporation may yield relatively lexicalized
incorporating verb stems (involving an incorporated bound noun) denoting wellidentified concepts in the Tikuna culture, but it is generally much more flexible
and productive than core argument incorporation.
Instances of possessee incorporation involving an incorporated constituent whose
possessor occupies the subject position of an intransitive verb root/stem are
provided in examples (336) (bound noun incorporation; see also (328a) above, and

(iii) Non-core participant incorporation Finally, in non-core participant incorporation, the semantic role of the incorporated constituent does
not correspond to that of either of the possible core arguments of the verb
root/stem. The interpretation of that semantic role is mostly left to context and
may be delicate to establish with certainty. In most cases, the referent identified
by the incorporated constituent can be broadly interpreted as having the semantic
role of a ground (portion of space proper, as in example (341); container, as in
(342); or vehicle, as in (328b) above) or as characterizing the state reached by
the object of a transitive verb denoting a transformation process (as in (343); see
also (169)). The valency of the verb root/stem and its mapping of syntactic positions with semantic roles are left unaltered. Non-core participant incorporation
virtually always involves the incorporation of bound nouns (not entire NPs). Like
possessee incorporation, non-core participant incorporation may yield relatively
lexicalized incorporating verb stems, although it is generally more flexible and
productive than core argument incorporation.

[jsg B258]4.2.5.3Pseudo-incorporation in possessive predicationPossessive predication of participants expressed as bound nouns exclusively operates through a construction that is formally identical with bound noun incorporation and appears to incorporate the bound noun to the verb roots ã̄ ‘to
have’ (positive possessive predication) or g̃e-̊ ‘not have’ (negative possessive—
or privative—predication, on which see Section 7.2.3). Possessive predication of
participants expressed as NPs may similarly operate through a construction that is
formally identical with NP incorporation and involves the same two verb roots,
although in the case of participants expressed as NPs an alternative construction
involving non-verbal predication is available, and apparently preferred over NP incorporation to ã̄ or g̃e-̊ (on this alternative construction, see Section 4.3.3.6). Note,
however, that the incorporation-like constructions employed for possessive predication are not, strictly speaking, genuine incorporation given that their possessee
participant cannot be extracted from ã̄ or g̃e-̊ so as to be expressed as a separate,
syntactically independent nominal constituent. Furthermore, from a syntacticosemantic perspective, these incorporation-like constructions do not quite fit with
any of the three functional types identified in the previous section. For these reasons, I consider them as cases of pseudo-incorporation, rather than incorporation
proper.
Instances of possessive pseudo-incorporation of a bound noun are provided
in examples (344) and (345).

Note that /kù=ã-̄ ya̋e-̄ pǜtā/ (2sg.sbj\sbjv=have-hair-tooth\sbjv) ‘he [lit.
‘you ...’] had hairs in the teeth’ in (345) can be analyzed as featuring both possessive pseudo-incorporation (‘his teeth have hairs’ literally encoded as ‘his teeth

reference to a third person participant to convey a notion of surprise, see Section 3.3.6, p.206).
An instance of possessive pseudo-incorporation of an NP is provided in the
following example:

For instances of pseudo-incorporation employed in privative predication,
see example (347) (the only case of formal incorporation where the (pseudo-)incorporated constituent is a syntactically complex NP in my corpus) and the examples in
Section 7.2.3.

Interestingly, the possessee participant of a positive possessive pseudo-incorporation construction,236 minimally in cases where it is an NP (as opposed to a bound
noun, for which I do not have spontaneous data), may be relativized using a kind
of gapping strategy. The pseudo-incorporated constituent is then dropped and the
possessive suffix /-ã/̰ gets directly attached to the verb stem after the genitive suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/ (as in e.g. /chā=ã-̄ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã̰/ [1sg.sbj=have-gen dog-poss] ‘I have
a dog’ > /(âirű yà=)chà=ã-̄ ãr̀ ǖ-ã̋-ʼè/ [(dog lk.n/s=)1sg.sbj\sbjv=have-genposs\sbjv-rel.s] ‘(the dog) that I have’). Note that gapping is otherwise only resorted to for relativizing participants with a syntactic function of subject or (core)
object in smat, while relativizing participants with any other syntactic function
regularly involves the use of a resumptive pronominal form standing for the pivot
within the relative clause. An instance of relativization of the NP possessee participant of a positive pseudo-incorporation construction is provided in the following
example:

2363294. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
San Martín is [jungle] that is exploited by man [lit. ‘... is [a jungle] that
[people] have worked in already.’]’ [jgs 220–221]4.3Non-verbal predicative phrasesSeveral types of non-verbal predicative phrases are attested in smat. These are
listed in Table 37. They involve the combination of a nominal constituent (a
circumstantial independent noun, a—non-circumstantial—independent noun, or an
entire NP) or an onomatopoeia together with a bound morpheme, which may be
either a suffix (/-ʼü̽̃/ ‘temp.pred’, /-ē/ ‘event.pred’, or /-ã/̰ ‘poss’), a predicative
relational noun (/-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, /-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, /-ʼpḛʼe/ ‘equal’, /-ʼchàʼǜ̃/ ‘vol’, or
/-ʼwa̰e/̄ ‘apprec’ or one of its subdialectal variants), or a bound noun.
From a semantic perspective, the resulting PPs serve for the expression of a
varied array of predication types. The meaning of each formal type of nonverbal predication identified in Table 37 is roughly glossed in the column ‘Resulting
PP’ (with ‘X’ standing for the respective nominal constituent to which the bound
morpheme in the leftmost column of the table is attached in the respective formal
type of non-verbal predication).
Note that, as indicated by plus signs <+> in Table 37, certain of the bound
morphemes that turn a nominal constituent into a non-verbal PP trigger the morphotonological alternation /43 /→/31 / when they are immediately attached to
the Allomorph 1 of a pronominal root featuring a lexical toneme /43 / (a process
that represents an instance of Pattern 2 morphotonological alternation, on which
see Section 2.6.2.2; on the definition of the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots,
see Section 3.3.1). Thus, the combination of the pronominal root /ná-/ ‘3n/ns’
with the predicative relational noun /-ʼchàʼü̃̀/ ‘vol’, for instance, yields the form
/nâ-ʼchàʼǜ̃/, with the lexical toneme /43 / of /ná-/ turning into /31 / (/nâ-/). Note
that, by definition, only bound nouns and relational nouns can be directly attached
to the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots. Suffixes, by contrast with bound nouns
and relational nouns, are defined as bound morphemes that cannot be attached to
the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots. That is why the bound morphemes in Table 37 that are suffixes, as opposed to bound nouns and relational nouns, feature
the mention ‘n/a’ (for ‘not applicable’) in the column ‘MA trigger’ (for ‘Pattern 2
Morphotonological Alternation trigger’).
The various types of non-verbal predication listed in Table 37 are discussed
and exemplified individually in the next sections (see the corresponding section

no longer seems to be related to its original demonstrative meaning, but resembles
instead the function of a preposition meaning ‘like’. In this function, ño̊má, which
does not seem to inflect for nominal class as it does in its ordinary demonstrative
function, immediately precedes an NP suffixed with the relational noun -ʼrüʼ̋ ü̃̀
‘like’. This is shown in examples (271–272). Note that in this construction the syntactic function of the NP is marked twice: once by ño̊má, and again by -ʼrüʼ̋ ü̃̀ ‘like’.
While -ʼrüʼ̋ ü̃̀ ‘like’ does not require the co-occurrence of ño̊má, ño̊má does conversely
seem to require that of -ʼrüʼ̋ ü̃̀ ‘like’, whose function it merely “replicates” (with anticipation) at the left edge of the NP.

"3.5.1Morphological paradigmThe morphological paradigm of the linker is displayed in Table 34 in its three
subdialectal variants classified by degree of conservativeness or innovativeness.
The inflectional forms of the linker unspecified for nominal tense, which are in
practice mostly used in non-past ([-pst]) contexts, are laid out in the first row of
each subdialectal variant of the paradigm. Its specifically past inflectional forms
([+pst]) are laid out in the second row of each variant.

Table 34. Morphological paradigm of the smat linker (including subdialectal variants)The only forms concerned by the subdialectal variation featured by the inflectional paradigm of the linker are the neuter and the salientive forms (the forms
highlighted in bold in the intermediary and innovative variants of the paradigm
in Table 34 are the ones that differ from their equivalent forms in the conservative variant of the paradigm). This variation is only of a tonological (i.e. not a
segmental) nature. Note, importantly, that this subdialectal variation is the reason
for the apparent inconsistency in the way the forms of the linker are glossed in the
examples throughout this grammatical description. Apparently identical forms of
the linker are necessarily glossed differently across speakers whose speeches make
use of distinct variants of the inflectional paradigm of the linker.
In the conservative variant of the paradigm (first two rows in Table 34), both
the neuter and the salientive forms of the linker (whether its forms unspecified for
nominal tense or its specifically [+pst] forms) exhibit a toneme /1 /. The reason I
identify this variant as comparatively conservative is because it is the one employed
by all the oldest speakers (i.e. those above age 60, approximately) who have collaborated in my research, regardless of their geographical origins (igs, hga, osp,
and gra in particular; certain younger speakers also use this variant, such as jgs).
In the intermediary variant of the inflectional paradigm of the linker (third
and fourth rows in Table 34), the neuter forms likewise exhibit a toneme /1 /, but
the salientive forms, for their part, exhibit a toneme /4 / (thereby aligning with the
masculine forms of all three variants of the paradigm of the linker). Only lar,
among the speakers who collaborated in my research, employs this variant. She
also uses, on rare occasions, the conservative variant (i.e. she occasionally uses
2533. The nominal phrase
the toneme /4 / variants of the salientive forms of the linker). The intermediary
variant can minimally be characterized as such from a structural point of view,
with respect to the conservative variant on the one hand and the innovative one on
the other. I tentatively hypothesize that it is also, diachronically, the bridge variant
that allowed the conservative variant to evolve into the innovative variant.
Finally, in the innovative variant of the inflectional paradigm of the linker
(last two rows in Table 34), both the neuter and the salientive forms exhibit a
toneme /4 / (thereby aligning with the masculine forms). This variant is the one
that displays most syncretism. The non-past form /yá=/ is indiscriminately used
in the masculine, neuter, and salientive nominal classes. The past form /gá=/, for
its part, can be said to no longer agree for nominal class, given that it is used in
all of them. I identify this variant of the paradigm of the linker as innovative both
because it is mostly used by younger speakers (e.g. jsg and igv), and because it
allows to encode less grammatical distinctions than the other two variants (i.e. it
most likely represents a simplification of one of the other two paradigms, which
must therefore have been prior in time).
Note that there is the possibility that more forms of the linker exist besides
those listed in Table 34. Attested in my data are a rare feminine form /á=/,
an occurrence of which is displayed in example (226), and a substantially more
frequent non-salientive form /ā=/ (for occurrences of which see (T76), (T144),
and (T154)), which I both identify—tentatively—as inflectional forms of the linker
in view of their syntactic distribution and their apparent function.

that of the non-locative demonstrative roots or the non-locative endophoric
demonstratives (on which see introduction to Section 3.4 and Section 3.4.3, respectively). More specifically, the inflectional forms of the linker unspecified for
nominal tense are likely to be cognate with the medial non-locative demonstrative roots or non-locative endophorics (compare e.g. /yá=/ ‘lk.m’ in the conservative variant of the paradigm of the linker with the medial non-locative demonstrative root /yi ̆-/ ‘med.m’ or the medial non-locative endophoric /yi ̆-má/ ‘med.manaph’; compare, likewise, /yà=/ ‘lk.n/s’ in the conservative variant of the paradigm of the linker with /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ and yi ̂ʼè ‘med.s’ or /yi ̂-mà/ ‘med.n-anaph’
2543. The nominal phrase
‘I go to Lake Tarapoto with them.’ [jgs 106]
The linker in (231) introduces a slightly different type of close apposition of very
common use in smat discourse. In this appositional construction, a NP features as
its first element an independent pronoun that is followed by a nominal constituent
(introduced by the linker) that makes explicit the referent of that pronoun.
(231)̂ à ì ngēmà kōri ̋gǘ.
Nge̋mà, expresogú i ̋nà-g̃ūgüʼ̋ ü̃́ ì nüm
nge̋-màexpreso-gúmed.aloc-anaph express.boat-ploci ̋=nà=g̃ū-gü-̋ ʼü̃́ì=[nü-̂ mà]3aloc=3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=reach-pl\sbjv-sub lk.ns=3n/ns-anaph[ì=ngē-màkōri ̋-gǘ]lk.ns=med.ns-anaph White.person-pl‘[My typical schedule, when I’m in charge of a group of tourists, starts with
preparing my boat. Then I go to the mouth of the Amacayacu river.] Then
the tourists arrive in express boat.’ [jgs 12]
In many cases, this appositional construction is essentially equivalent, from a semantic and pragmatic perspective, to just mentioning the nominal constituent without its preceding pronoun and, consequently, without the linker (e.g. /[ná-máʼa]
[i ̀=pōʼi ̋]/ [3n/ns-com lk.ns=plantain] = /pōʼi ̋-máʼa/ [plantain-com] ‘with plantains’). When the pronoun in the kind of appositional construction under discussion
is an independent pronoun in the zero-case (i.e. a pronoun in /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’; see
Section 3.3.3), however, expressing a participant via the appositional construction contrasts with mentioning it plainly in that employing the appositional construction explicitly signals that the mention of the participant involves a change
of topic (e.g. /[tü̂-mà] [yá=chô-ʼrǖ pāpa̋]/ [3s-anaph lk.m/s=1sg-gen dad] ‘(as
for) my father’ contrasts with /chô-ʼrǖ pāpa̋/ [1sg-gen dad] ‘my dad’). This is why
the speaker in (231) mentions the tourists—which in the context entail a change
of topic—via the appositional construction (involving the independent pronoun in
the zero-case /nü̂-mà/ [3n/ns-anaph]).
Examples (232–236) essentially illustrate the same use of the linker as (228–231)
above. In (232–236), however, the two parts of the complex NP between which
the linker is establishing an overt link are not syntactically adjacent, but separated by constituents that are not part of that complex NP. I call “scattered
NPs” such NPs interrupted by constituents that do not belong to them syntactically. The linker in (232) introduces a relative clause, just like in (228) above,
2583.5. Linker
except that the NP integrated by the linker in (232) is scattered on both sides of the
predicative phrase.

Example (233) is likewise parallel to (229) above, with a linker also introducing
the head of a NP, except that the NP in (233) is scattered on both sides of the
predicative phrase:

Example (234) features a linker introducing a close apposition in a NP scattered
on both sides of the NP (contrast with (231) above):

Examples (235–236) feature instances of scattered NPs that are not interrupted by a predicative phrase, but by a nominal constituent (note that chîʼè ‘be
bad’ in (235) and pūrākǘ ‘to work’ in (236), although they happen to be verb roots,
occur in these examples as zero-derived nominalizations, which is why they can
be analyzed as nominal constituents). The linker in these two examples introduces
close appositions in constructions of the type pronoun lk=nominal.constituent presented above in the discussion of example (231).

A11]3.5.2.2Linking a nominal constituent to a coreferential indexthat precedes itExamples (237–240) illustrate a function of the linker that is relatively different from the one discussed in the preceding section. In (237–240), the linker does
not link two parts of a complex NP, but a pronominal index that is part of the
inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase, on the one hand, and a
nominal constituent that is coreferential with that index and occurs after the
predicative phrase, on the other hand (this function of the linker was introduced
in the discussion of (225) above). This use of the linker is functionally comparable to its use in the pronoun lk=nominal.constituent close appositional
construction, except that here the pronominal element in the construction is no
2603.5. Linker
longer a free form as above, but an index. In (237), two distinct (i.e. non coreferential) nominal constituents occur after the predicative phrase, with each of them
making referentially explicit one of the two pronominal indexes procliticized to the
predicative phrase:
(237)Cha̋ná-g̃ṵ i ̀ chòmà i ̀ gűʼü.̃́
cha̋i =náj =g̃ṵ[i ̀=chò-mà]i[i ̀=gű-ʼü̃́]j1sg.ben=3m/n/ns.sbj=hurt lk.ns=1sg-anaph lk.ns=finish\sbjv-rel.ns‘I regret all of it [lit. ‘It all hurts for me.’].’ [ano1 163]
Example (238) illustrates the same phenomenon (in the second of the two clauses it
comprises), but additionally shows (in its first clause) that the linker is not required
to introduce a nominal constituent that precedes the predicative phrase (in that
case, the nominal constituent is not indexed on the predicative phrase):
(238)Kōpīwāràmàchī tíī-gû. Táyā-gû i ̀ kōpi ̄wāràmàchi ̄.
kōpīwārà-màchī tíī=gû

lk.ns=capybara-meat‘She roasted the capybara meat. She roasted the capybara meat.’ [jsg C146–
147]
Example (239) displays a case where the predicative phrase is a non-verbal one
(on non-verbal predicative phrases in /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, see Section 4.3.3.1) and the
pronominal form it comprises is not an index, but in fact a free pronoun. The
nominal constituent that follows the predicative phrase and makes this free pronoun
referentially explicit bears, as expected, the linker.
(239)̂ àtānǜgù ãʼ̄ a gá gûʼèmá dùã̰ […].
[…] tá-tüm

In (240), the presence of a linker introducing the nominal constituent can be interpreted as representative of the same function of the linker as a marker establishing
an overt link between a nominal constituent and an index that precedes it. This utterance lacks a predicative phrase altogether, however, and consequently lacks any
2613. The nominal phrase
index that could stand in a relation of coreferentiality with the nominal constituent
that bears the linker. This is because an inflected form of the copular verb i ̃̊ ‘to
be’ (in this case, /ni ́i ̀i =i/̃̊ [3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀=be] ‘it is’), although ellipsed (as is
often the case with this verb root), is virtually present in the utterance. In a
way, in such a configuration, it is the linker that signals where the ellipsed form
of the copular verb (which would necessarily have occurred before the linker) is to
be virtually inserted (in the absence of the linker highlighted in bold in (240), the
whole utterance would be interpreted as an NP meaning ‘that work of mine’).
(240)Ngēmà ì chārǖ pūrākǘ ì chòmà.
ngē-mà[ì=chā-rǖpūrākǘ ì=chò-mà]imed.ns-anaph lk.ns=1sg-gen worklk.ns=1sg-anaph‘That[’s] my work.’ [jgs 80]
The linker that introduces the second half of the cleft constructions that
serve for focalization can be interpreted as representing, again, the same use of
the linker as a marker establishing an overt link between a nominal constituent
and an index that precedes it. Instances of such constructions are provided in examples (241–243). In (241), the focalized constituent (/pĕ-nátǖ/ [2pl-father]
‘your father’) has the semantic role of the subject of the predicative phrase
/ü̆-ʼchi ̋rù/ (make-clothes) ‘to clothe’. At a strictly syntactic level, however, that
focalized constituent functions as the complement of the copular verb /ni ́i ̀=i/̃̊
(3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀=be) ‘it is’. What functions as the syntactic subject of the copula is the relative clause chā-üʼ̆ chi ̋rūkǖ tá i ̀ ñṵmá ‘who will clothe me from now
on’. Because that relative clause is coreferential with the subject index /ni ́i ̀=/
‘3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀’ in ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ ‘it is’ and occurs after the main predicative phrase, it
has to bear the linker (on focalization implemented by means of cleft constructions
involving relative clauses, see Section 5.2.5, p.420).

246]
In (242–243), because the focalized constituent does not have the semantic role
of the subject or object of the embedded predicative phrase, the second half of
2623.5. Linker
the cleft construction is not a relative clause but a subordinate clause in /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’
(on focalization implemented by means of cleft constructions involving subordinate
clauses in /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’, see Section 5.2.6, p.426). Because that subordinate clause
functions syntactically as the subject of the copular verb and follows it, it bears,
again, the linker.

Note that, just like in (240) above, the copular verb may be ellipsed from focalization constructions. The constituent that virtually occurs “after” the copular
verb, however, retains its linker, although no coreferential index preceding it is in
practice present (see (342) for a case of ellipsis of the copular verb from a focalization construction).","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268]"
"Table 47. Smat verb roots and verb stems with suppletive singular vs plural forms
/ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sg-in.pl) ‘to enter’ and /ṹ-ʼǜ̃/ (go.sg-out.pl) ‘to exit’, are irregular
inasmuch as they feature the plural allomorph of a figure-ground configuration suffix (instead of its singular allomorph, as expected; see paragraph (v) below). The
verb stem meaning ‘to return’ (sg. /ta̋-ègù/ ‘drop.sg-inv’, pl. /wò-ègù/ ‘drop.plinv’), for its part, can be considered to have, to a certain degree, non-compositional
semantics.
This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between the
three pairs of examples (602–564), (565–566), and (567–568). The first pair of
examples shows that the distribution of the two allomorphs go̊ and yi ̀ of the intransitive verb meaning ‘to grow’ relies on whether the subject of this verb is singular,

In (565–566), the same principle is shown to apply to the distribution of the allomorphs ta̰ and wò of the transitive verb meaning ‘to drop’. Note, however, that it
is now the number of the object argument (as opposed to the subject argument as
in the preceding two examples) that determines the use of the singular or plural
allomorph of the verb:

The fact that it is the number of the object argument, rather than that of the subject argument, that determines the selection of the singular or plural allomorph of
transitive verb roots inflecting for number is made even clearer by (567–568). In
(567), although the subject is explicitly marked as plural (by the presence of the
suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ within the predicative phrase), the singular allomorph gå of the
verb meaning ‘to lead’ is selected in accordance with the singular number of the
4915. Inflection of the predicative phrase
object argument. Conversely, in (568), although the subject is explicitly singular
(as indicated by /chà=/ ‘1sg.sbj\sbjv’), the plural allomorph nâ of the same verb
is selected in accordance with the plural number of the object argument.

(iv) Addition of /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’. The plural (or collective) value of the number
feature of the subject argument of certain verbal intransitive predicative phrases
is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through the addition
of the suffix /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ to these predicative phrases. It is unclear why certain
verbal intransitive predicative phrases may receive this suffix (e.g. pé ‘to sleep’,
tåʼu ‘to be absent’, or chi ́bǜ ‘to eat’), while others never do (e.g. ó ‘to disappear’,
déʼà ‘to speak’, or dău ‘to see’, the latter being an intransitive verb root that takes a
complement in the accusative), and still others display some inter-speaker variation
with respect to whether or not they may take this suffix (e.g. ngǜ ‘to rest’).
The verb pūrākǘ ‘to work’ belongs to the lexical class of predicative phrases that
regularly take /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ when their subject is plural (or collective). Contrast
example (569), where pūrākǘ is not suffixed with /-ē/ as its subject corresponds
referentially to a single man, with (570), where pūrākǘ is suffixed with /-ē/ as its
subject now corresponds to a group of men.

(v) Selection of figure-ground configuration suffix allomorph. The
singular vs plural (or collective) value of the number feature of the subject argument of most verbal intransitive predicative phrases that contain any of the
derivational suffixes encoding the figure-ground configurations ‘in’, ‘out’, and ‘off’,
and that of the object argument of most verbal transitive predicative phrases that
contain these same suffixes, is regularly—although not entirely systematically—
encoded through the selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of
these suffixes (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́/ ‘in.sg’ vs /-ku̽/ ‘in.pl’). On these suffixes, see Sections 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.2, and 4.2.3.5.
This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between examples (571) and (572) (the latter being repeated from (455b) above). These largely
parallel examples differ in the selection of the form of the figure-ground configuration suffix featured in their essentially synonymous main predicative phrases. In
(571), the singular allomorph /-ē/ of the figure-ground configuration suffix meaning ‘off’ is selected for, while it is its plural allomorph /-ǜ̃/ that is used in (572). Because the predicative phrases in question are transitive, the selection of /-ē/ ‘off.sg’
in (571) indicates that the object argument is singular (in this case, a mash), while
the selection of /-ǜ̃/ ‘off.pl’ in (572) indicates that the object argument is plural (in
this case, plantains).

Note, however, than in a few lexicalized predicative phrases, the plural allomorph of a figure-ground configuration suffix is used in practice with a singular value, as in the singular intransitive predicative phrases /ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sgin.pl) ‘to enter (sg.)’ and /ṹ-ʼǜ̃/ (go.sg-out.pl) ‘to exit (sg.)’, in particular.
(vi) Distributive suffix allomorph selection.
The non-plural (i.e. singular or collective) vs plural value of the number feature of the subject, object, or
accusative argument of predicative phrases that contain the derivational distributive suffix is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through the
selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of this suffix (specifically
/-chi ̀gǜ/ ‘distr.sg’ vs /-ètānǜ/ ‘distr.pl’). In a clause that contains several arguments that could be specified by the plural form of the distributive suffix (e.g. both
the subject and object arguments of a transitive predicative phrase), which of them
is being specified by it as plural is left to context.
This strategy for number encoding in illustrated by the contrast between examples (573) and (574). These examples both feature a predicative phrase that
includes the plural form of the intransitive verb meaning ‘to go’ (i ̃̂). These predicative phrases necessarily have a non-singular (i.e. collective or plural) subject. The
one in (573) is suffixed with the non-plural form of the distributive suffix (/-chi ̀gǜ/),
which indicates that its subject (in this case, the jungle fauna) is to be viewed as a
collective entity rather than as a collection of individuals. In such a context, distributivity is accordingly interpreted as indicating that the process occurs little by
little or step by step.

[ano2 7:29–7:34]
By contrast, the predicative phrase containing i ̃̂ ‘to go (pl.)’ in (574) is suffixed with
the plural form of the distributive suffix (/-ètānǜ/), which indicates that its subject
(in this case, students) is to be viewed as a collection of individuals rather than as
a collective entity. In such a context, distributivity is accordingly interpreted as
indicating that each of these individuals is involved in a specific sub-occurrence of
the process (in this case, each individual student comes from a community that is
different from that of all or part of the other students).

[jgs 713–716]
(vii) Addition of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’. Finally, the plural value of the number feature of
either the subject, object, or accusative argument of apparently any predicative
phrase may be optionally made explicit by the addition of the suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ to
that predicative phrase. In a clause that contains several arguments that could be
specified by /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ (e.g. both the subject and object arguments of a transitive
4955. Inflection of the predicative phrase
predicative phrase), which of them is being specified by it as plural is left to
context. Note that this suffix, by contrast with /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ (see paragraph (iv)
above), is transcategorial, i.e. it may be attached to words belonging to several
parts of speech, including nominal constituents and predicative phrases.
Examples (575) and (576) both feature the verb déʼà occurring with a third person non-salientive subject. The number of the subject argument of déʼà in (575)
is left unspecified (in this case, the subject—a single man—is contextually singular). In (576), by contrast, déʼà bears the suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’, which in this case may
only indicate that its subject is plural since no other potentially plural argument is
present in the clause.

Although in this section I treat on the same level the seven identified strategies
for specifying the number feature of arguments within a predicative phrase, note
that not all of them can be equally said to be inflectional in nature. The encoding of number through index selection (see paragraph (i)) and predicative class
reassignment (see paragraph (ii)) may only operate in finite predicative phrases as it
4965.10. Strategies for participants number encoding
relies on strictly inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase. The remaining
five strategies (see paragraphs (iii–vii)), by contrast, rely on morphology that can
be considered as derivational in nature inasmuch as it may occur in non-finite
predicative phrases. For instance, the use of the plural allomorph of a verb root inflecting for number (strategy discussed in paragraph (iii)) and that of the suffix /-ē/
‘intr.pl’ (strategy discussed in paragraph (iv)) in zero-derived nominalizations are
illustrated in examples (577) and (578) respectively.

Note, however, that in spontaneous speech the plural (or collective) marking
morphological devices employed by these remaining five strategies rarely occur in
non-finite predicative phrases. In such contexts, their singular counterparts may
be generalized with, in practice, no indication of singular number implied.
Thus, in example (579), the singular allomorph of the verb meaning ‘to kill’ (ma̰)
is used in a non-finite nominalization while its “object” argument, which is syntactically treated as a genitive complement (/dùa-̰̃ ãr̀ ǖ/ ‘human-gen’), is referentially
plural (the noun dùã̰ ‘human’ virtually always has a plural referent, which the context indicates is also the case in this example).

Note, also, that the five strategies discussed in paragraphs (iii–vii), although
their application does not systematically correlate with the number features of arguments, are applied consistently in a majority of cases in spontaneous speech
(the strategy of predicative class reassignment described in (ii), in comparison, is
only resorted to occasionally).
For these reasons, while one cannot talk of a grammatical system of agreement
for number beyond the encoding of first and second person participants in smat (in
the way that one can talk of an elaborate smat grammatical system of agreement
for nominal class, in particular), number in the language may still be considered
to a certain extent as an inflectional category, even outside of first and second
person participants.","[495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503]"
