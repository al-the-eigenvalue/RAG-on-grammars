"The mutual combinability of the consonant-phonemes is much more
limited than that of the vowel-phonemes. With some consonants only
a few combinations occur, whereas others, e.g. m and n appear to have
more possibilities. Concerning the occurrence or non-occurrence of
consonant-sequences there are only three general rules, applying to all
consonants. These rules are:
1° a consonant-sequence can never be word-final.
2° sequences of more than three consonants do not occur; the only
exception is hngr (see below, § 13).23
3° a sequence of two identical consonants does not occur. Consequently
in all polymorphematic words, in which such a sequence could be
expected on account of the constituent morphemes, only one consonant is found (for instances of this see Part Two).
As with these three negative rules not everything is said, we still
have to survey the various consonant-sequences found. They will be
arranged under the heading of the first consonant.
23But this exception is not found with all speakers (see Ch. IV, § 12).",[43]
"PART ONE:PHONOLOGYI. THE WORDBefore proceeding to the description of the Nimboran speech-sounds
and their functions, we have to discuss a term whioh - although a
common notion in non-linguistic use - in many linguistic puhlications
is either purposely avoided or used without any definition or discussion:
the word. Our description is based on the standpoint that the Nimboran
language has wOf'ds as its sma!l1est independent meaningful units. As <this
is not the place to set forth the theoretical backgrounds of t'his wewpoints, reference may be made to the existing literature.1
In general, the word, as a linguistic unit, is characterized by:1. a fixed form, connected with a meaning,
2. isolability.
That a word has its own form and meaning, comes from its signvalue. 2 By ""fixed form"" we mean a set of specific sound-characteristics
in a fixed order. Seeming exceptions to this rule will be dealt with
separately (see esp. chapter VIII). The term ""isolability"" does not mean
that every word may be used separately (i.e. as the only constituent of
a sentence), but refers to the fact tha:t words have 1!he possibility of
being separated from surrounding words, e.g. by the insention of other
words.
The assumption of the w01""d, as a basic unit, neither denies the
possibility of border-line cases, like the ""sub-words"", discussed in
Ch. VII, 4, nor is in any way contradicted by the existence of such
border-cases.
Phonological characteristics of words as such will be discussed in
chapters III to VII.

"The Nimboran language area is enclosed by the area of the Uria
language in the west and south, by the Gresi area in the south-east, the
language of the villages K wanSH and Bonggrang and the Kamtuk
language in the east, by the Tanahmerah language ·in the north-east,
and by the languages of Demta and Tariia in the north.
Of all these languages only Tariia does not show any relationship to
Nimboran. 2 The closest relationships of Nimboran are those with the
languages of GTesi, Kwansu-Bonggrang, Kamtuk and Mekwei (also
called Menggwei). The last-mentioned language is spoken in a number
of villages, lying between Sentani Lake and the north coast, and so is
enclosed by the Sentaru language and the Tanahmerah language which

12THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEis closely related to Sentani. 3 Nimboran, Kwansu-Bonggrang, Gresi,
Kamtuk, and Mekwei constitute a dose-knit linguistic subgroup; the
speakers of these languages also show many common features in their
cultures.
Of these languages Gresi and Kamtuk are most closely related. The
position of the Kwansu-Bonggrang language may be said to be half
way between these and Nimboran. The position of Mekwei within the
subgroup is a bit more apart. So it might be said thart the geographical
position of these five languages is fairly reflective of their mutual
relationships.
3. How the materials were collected.
The data for the present description were gathered in the years 1954
to 1957. In the following years from time to time incidenta:1 additions
were made. The way of collecting data was based on the assumption
that '<lin accur<lite idea of the structure of a language can only be formed
when the 'reseal'cher has acquired a sufficient degree of mastery - both
active and passive - of the language in question. This appeared to be
an exacting and timetaking affair, but was most remunerative. However,
even if the researcher learns to speak the language, he can ill dispense
with the help of informants, because otherwise he might stand in
jeopardy of describing not the language itself but only tht part of it
whioh he has learned to use. On the other hand mastering the language
is a powerful means to the efficient use of informants.
During ;these years so m<liuy people served as informants for the
r'esearch from which the present description has resulted, that it is
imposs~ble to mention all their names. But an exception must be made
£01' Dina N apo, an adolescent girl, who was a daily collaborator f'Or
years. She proved to possess an outstanding intelligence and a natural
gift for linguistic work whioh was not hampered by any preconceived
theory whilch might have made it less easy for her to look upon her
language with an open mind. Very soon she got a dear perception of
the how and why of linguistic research and helped to think out means
to discuss linguistic matters in her own language, showing great powers
of invention in coining grammatical terms -etc. Moreover, she had the
sense not only to check up - in a crafty, subtle way - doubtful points
wi,tIh other informants, but also to be constantly in search for exceptions

"In Nimboran, as in most languages, borrowing words from other
languages is an important means for enriching the vocabulary.
Especially in recent times, foreign cultural influence has been the
cause of many words being borrowed. The most important lending
language is the lingua franca, which is used - with some regional
variaDJts - in the coastal areas Oof western New Guinea. This language
we call New Guinea Malay (NGM), for want of a better tenn. This
NGM is not very much different frOom Bahasa Indonesia, the national
language of Indonesia, so that in many cases the question, if a word
was borrowed from NGM or from Indonesian, is utterly senseless.
For words, borrowed by Nimboran frOom other languages - among
which in the first place Dutch must be mentioned -, NGM often, but
not always, served as an intennediary. As Indonesian/Malay was
introduced in primary education already years ago, every Nimboran-44THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEspeaker has a certain knowledge of this language .and borrows words
from it freely, not only in high-flown speech-making and in technical
statements, but also in everyday conversation. Especially among the
younger generart:ion, garnishing the language with Malay jIndonesian
words is an established custom, even in those cases in which original
Nimboran words would be as good or even better.

"A morphological category may be productive or improductive. If a
category is improductive, new members can not normally be added,
and, consequently, its members can be enumerated.
Productive categories, however, have no fixed number of members;
they represent a procede that may be extended over ever more words.
Such productive procedes provide a speaker with the morphological
means for forming new words, no matter wether he has heard these
words being used by other speakers or not. Investigating the ways in
which this is performed is the main subject of descriptive morphology.s

"Word-final 1 is Inst, except if immediately preceded by i or 0, as -it
becomes -ie and -01 becomes -uo, e.g.
repe - spoon (Dutch lepel) ,
pinsie - pencil (Mal. pensil) ,
betuo - bottle (Mal. botol) ,
pasiuo - pick (Mal. patjol).
This is a clear case of a word borrowed from Indonesian; the NGM
equivalent is ketimun.

taringy - flour (Mal. terigu) ,
ngam - chewing-gum (Eng1ish gum),
temante, tomante - tomato (Dutch tomaat or Mal. tomat).
Above we already came across the forms temate and tomate; m this
case different ways af adaptation gave rise to four alternants.
In some cases the changes are less simple than those discussed above.

the word tusa which is found in eastern Indonesian languages, but
this leaNes unexplained the change Q1f final a into e. 40
The words 1)gr0Jru and 1)gratue both mean ""tractor, bulldozer,
road-grader"". However, it is uncertain if the model was tractor or
grader. It is not beyornd possibility that the two words blended into Q1ne.
Besides bendera - flag (Mal. bendera), an alternalllt mendro exists,
which :is used particularly by the aged and is regarded as ridiculous
by the young people, more versed in Malay. Likewise especially used
by the older people is ari1)gy as an alternant of harimi1)gu - week,
Sunday (Mal. hari minggu).
'Dhe[""e are more instances of adaption making one word out of what
was originally two, as is the case in harimi1)gu, e.g. tua1)gry - teacher
(Mal. tttan guru - Mister teacher).
In some cases popular etymology caused formal deviations. So for
""co-'Operative"", instead 'Of a form which could be expected from Mal.
koprasi like koprasi, the expression kym prasi, literaIIy meaning
""c'Oconut magic"",41 came into use.
Of the two alternant words for ""maize"", iembrokase and emberekase,
some people think the latter is more correct, as they interpret it with
NGM amberi kasi - foreigners gave it.42
There is another expression aiam fuse, used as an abusive term for women.
The explanation, given by some informants, that its original meaning was
""duck"", does not seem to be. very reliable.
41, This is closely connected with the fact that the Nimboran people think of
means to modern development first of all as magical means for procuring
wealth.
42 It is not easy to see what the real history of this word must have been. It is
rather certain that the first part of it is the word amber - foreigner. Most
probably it came, by a long route, from one of the languages of the Geelvink
Bay area. W ondama, an Austronesian langilage in that area, has as an
equivalent pas-amber - litt. foreign rice. That the constituent parts of the
expression changed places on the way from an Austronesian to a nonAustronesian language, is easily accounted for by syntactical rules, governing
these languages. But the change of pinto k remains unexplained, as long as
we do not know more about the historical backgrounds.","[58, 59]"
"The formal characteristics, marking words as members of a category,
we call m 0 r p hem e s. The use of this term is open to objections,
as in many linguistic publications it is used in a meaning which we
do not want to attach to it, viz. the meaning of a basic structural unit.
In this matter we share Uhlenbeck's view, that ""a morpheme is
merely a moment in a word"".2 Therefore, we would prefer to speak
of ""formal features marking members of a morphological category as
such"". But this would be a long-winded and cumbersome formula and
so we will use the existing word ""morpheme"". However, we do this

During three years of linguistic research in \Vestern New Guinea
in the service of the Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde (Royal Institute of Linguistics, Geography and Ethnology, The
Hague), the writer had as his main task the study and analysis of a
hitherto undescribed language. \Vhen the choice fell on the Nimboran
language, it was not to be foreseen that this meant opening up a gold
mine of linguistic data. Indeed, the investigations, though often slow
and laborious, proved most rewarding. The amount of data was so
overwhelming that remoulding them into a complete description required
much time. Moreover, it was my wish to do more than just listing the
facts. From the outset, I tried to undig the generative aspect of the
linguistic structure. Therefore, the idea was not to compile a corpus
of data which could be analysed later on, but to find out what role
every element that was recorded could play in building new utterances.
This meant that the description was to be made along new lines. It
was only after years that I found the peace to complete this task. In
the near future I hope to add a description of Nimboran syntax, some
texts, and a vocabulary to the phonological and morphological parts,
embodied in the present volume.
I owe a great debt of gratitude to the Koninklijk Instituut voor
Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde for both organizing the research and
publishing the results, and to the former Government of Netherlands
New Guinea and the Netherlands Organisation for the Advancement
of Pure Research (Z.W.O.) for liberally subsidizing the project.
I am also deeply in debt to Dr. J. van Baal, then Governor of
Netherlands New Guinea, whose sympathetic and interested attitude
appeared most helpful, and to Mr. C. J. Grader and Dr. J. V. de Bruyn
of the Bureau of Native Affairs (Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken) who
did very much in paving the way and taking charge of all sorts of
practical arrangements. Much help was also given by the DistrictOfficers, Dr. Vv'. J. H. Kouwenhoven and Mr. E. van Voskuylen.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
"Morphology is concerned with those words which show a partial
similarity in form and in meaning, in so far as their partial differences
in form and meaning show a systematic character. As there appears
to be a good deal of misunderstanding with regard to this matter, we
have to enter, at least, into the basic principles.
In many languages, including Nimboran, groups of words are found
which show a partial similarity in their forms and also have a common
element in their meanings, whereas each of these words can be opposed
to one or more other words from which they are differentiated by
precisely the same formal and semantic element. Such groups we call
m 0 r p hoi 0 g i c a I cat ego r i e S.l The formal feature(s), shared
by the members of a category, need not be absolutely uniform but may
show some variation, provided that this variation is defined by the
phonemical shape of the word and, therefore, is predictable. If differences are found which are unpredictable, the words in question do not
belong to one category.

"++bekabciu - I kick above,
bekabcie - you kick above,
bekabcim, bekabam - he kicks above,
bekabom, bekabom - she (it) kicks above,
uobciu - I dibble above, etc.,
1Jgrumbciu - I hang up above, etc.,
te13g6mbciu - I knock above, etc.
13In cases like this Charles F. Hockett uses the term ""portmanteau representation
of a morpheme group"" (Two models of grammatical description, Word, X
(1954), p. 210-234, esp. p. 216). Because our basic principles (see Ch. I)
are different from those of Hockett, we do not feel the need of such a term.",[78]
"But even by those people who speak their language correctly members
of productive categories are sometimes used side by side with words
belonging to improductive categories without any difference of use
or meaning. Then the categories to which these words belong are in
com pet i t ion. Occasionally, competition is found between improductive categories.

partly similar in shape - as is found between a member of a productive
category and a corresponding word belonging to some other category,
whereas the same difference in form is not found in combination with
the same difference in meaning with any other pair of words. As such
b 1 0 c k a din g w 0 r d s mark the boundary of the sphere of operation
of the productive categories in the same way as b 1 0 c k a din g
cat ego r i e s, we have to mention them in our morphological
description.
No mention will be made of those cases in which a lexical meaning
is incompatible with a categoric meaning. Such forms do not normally
occur, but, at any rate, they are conceivable.
Between productive categories on the one side and semantically
equivalent improductive categories (and ditto blockading words) on
the other side a certain tension exists. In the case of Nimboran, this
is apparent from the fact that born speakers of the language who lived
outside their own community for a long time, say several years, display
a tendancy to substitute (new) members of productive categories for
members of improductive categories or blockading words. In this way,
the character of the productive categories is clearly demonstrated.
8. Competitive forms.","[64, 65]"
"The phonetic structure of a foreign word may be such that adaptation
brings about only phonetic changes, i.e. the phonemes are actualized
in the Nimboran way. This is the case with e.g.bena13 - thread (Mal. benang).35
tero13 - egg-fruit (Solanum spp.). The NGM form terong probably
comes from Javanese, as the Indonesian word is terung.
baua13 - onion (Mal. bawang).
kaiin - cloth (Mal. kain).
35Words from other languages are given here in their usual spelling. The
spelling of NGM words is based on the official orthography of the Bahasa
Indonesia, difference in word-structure being taken into account. With the
indication Mal. (Malay) is meant: Indonesian plus NGM.",[56]
"The same can be done with the rest of the given verb-forms. In this
way, it appears that forms, having a formal element -d- immediately
preceding the Actor morpheme and having as part of their meaning
""the action will take place in the future, or begins in the present and
will continue in the future, or takes place in the present and is directed
towards the future"", are opposed to forms which do not have this
semantic element and are characterized by having -t- or -k- instead of
the -d-. The words characterized by the morpheme -d- constitute a
productive category which we call the category of the Future.
Further study of the use of Future forms shows that the given
formula of the categoric meaning is not broad enough. Because forms
of the Future category are often used to indicate that the actor intends
or wants to perform the action, or that the speaker wants the action
to take place. In the latter case, the meaning may be a command or
a request.
The words, characterized by the morpheme -t- which immediately
precedes the Actor morpheme, all show the semantic element ""the
action takes place in the present or is completed in the present"". They
constitute a category which, again, appears to be productive. This we
call the category of the Present.
Sometimes, members of the Present category are also used when,
strictly speaking, the action does not relate to the present, or is not60TIlE NIMBORAN LANGUAGElimited to the present. For Present forms are used in all those cases
in which the time of the action is unimportant or is left out of account
(in general statements and the like). So it might be said that, semantically, this category is characterized by the absence of a certain element
of meaning and its members have reference to actions, not explicitly
mentioned as belonging to either the future or the past.
The fact that many Present forms are formally characterized by a
zero morpheme - as we shall see later on - may be said to be III
accordance with this.
The words which are characterized by the morpheme -k- have in
common the semantic feature ""the action took place in the past"". They
appear to constitute a productive category which we call the category
of the Past.
The categories of Present, Past, and Future are of the same order.
This we call the order of the categories of Tense. That this order is
different from that of the Actor categories appears from the fact that
all verb-forms, given so far, belong to an Actor category as well as
to a Tense category.
6. The category of the Recent Past.","[69, 70]"
"From the last example it appears that the final 13 of the rootmorpheme na13- reacts to a m, immediately following within the word,
in the same way as the final 13 of root-morphemes of verbs.

"6S4THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEwalking. In such cases we may speak of a z e rom 0 r p hem e with
those words which are characterized by the absence of a certain formal
feature. It is clear that this is just another way of saying that a certain
element of form is absent and that this absence determines the place
of the word, or words, in question within the morphological framework
of the language.
In our discussion of Nimboran morphology we will time and again
come across cases which can be described with the term zero morpheme.
In some cases we will even have to speak of zero root-morpheme.

1. The Nimboran language and its speakers.","[13, 14, 15]"
"In the preceding chapter we stated that every word has its specific
sound-form. These forms consist of sound-units which are called
phonemes. Phonemes differ from each other in distinctive features;
each phoneme may be considered as a bundle of such distinctive soundfeatures.
Phonemes are important means for ·!:'he identification of word-forms
through hearing. The determination of the role, played by any phoneme
in the recognizability of a word-form, is conditioned by several factors,
including the number of phonemes constituting the word,3 ,the existence
(or non-existence) of other words which show a certain degree of
sim~larity in sound-form to the word in question, and the contribution
to the recognizability offered by the context or the situation. In the
practical use of language redundancy of means of identification is of
quite commOon occurrence. The distinctive value of phonemes, their
identificational function, reaches a maximum, when words are isolated
from any context. 4
So the distinctive value of phonemes does not stand out clearly under
all circumstances. On the other hand not all phonemes are the same in
this respect, as they appear to show differences in their possibilities of
mutual combinability and in the places they can occupy in a word-form.
Consequen1'ly, some phonemes have much more chance of showing their
distinctive, identificational, value than other phonemes have. But the
mere fact that a sound-unit's possibilities of occurrence are limited,
need not be a reason for denying its phoneme-status. In the discussion
of1!he separate phonemes we will come across some instances of this sort.
Our description of the phonetic characteristics of the phonemes will
be limited to tJhe way in which the sounds are produced. 5 Of course their
identificational function is connected with their acoustical qualities but,
as we are not able to make a description along these lines, we are forced
to co~fine ourselves to the articulatory characte6stics, as is indeed
common practice.",[20]
"In the same way, we find bekdbaku - I kicked above, etc., opposed
to bekdku etc. and u6baku - I dibbled above, etc., opposed to u6ku etc.
Formally, these new forms show an element -ba- immediately preceding the Tense morpheme. Further, the vowel of this -ba- has an
accent, just like one of the vowels of the root-morpheme. Semantically,
these forms are characterized by the element ""in a place within the
speaker's sight but higher than that of the speaker"".
The other forms, with which we compared them, lack both the -baand the semantic element, just described. It appears that this -ba- is
the morpheme of a productive category which we call the Second
Position category.
The occurrence of two accents in one word, as found with members
of this category, has already been mentioned in Part One, Ch. VII, § 3.
As we shall see later on, this is the case with the majority of the
verb-forms. If a verb-form has two accents, one is on a vowel of the
root-morpheme, the other is on a vowel of a categoric morpheme.
Usually, the former is secundary and the latter a primary accent but
a speaker may prefer to make the accent of the root-morpheme a
primary one, which automatically causes the other accent to be secondary. This happens particularly if the lexical meaning is stressed, as is
the case when two forms, differing in lexical meaning, are contrasted,
e.g. bekdbaku kuo be, u6Mku - I did not kick above, I dibbled above.",[72]
"All these new forms belong to a productive category whose members
have in common the semantical element ""the action is connected with
a plural object"". Formally, the members are characterized by an
element -de- that immediately follows the root-morpheme and takes the
form -da- whenever it is immediately followed by the Tense morpheme.
This category we call the Plural Object category. It is in opposition
with the Masculine Object category and also with those verbal forms
which are not marked as to object. These unmarked forms are used,
if the speaker thinks the action connected with a singular or dual
object which does not consist of one or two male beings, but also if
the action is not thought being connected with any object. These
unmarked forms constitute the category of the Unspecified Object.
The members of the Plural Object category ask for further discussion. The first striking fact about them is that with those verbs
which have a special Singular stem for the Unspecified Object and
Masculine Object forms (see § 35) this special form of the rootmorpheme does not occur in Plural Object forms. Further, it must
be observed that all non-Singular forms have the -i- which we came
to know as Plural marker and also the special form of the root-MORPHOLOGY107morpheme which belongs to Plural forms. However, as far as their
meaning is concerned, they are no typical Plural Actor forms, as they
may have the meaning of Dual Actor, in the case of the Third Person
Neutral even exclusively so. In the Plural Object category there is
no opposition between Dual and Plural of the Actor, except with the
non-masculine Third Person for which there is a separate form having
only Dual meaning, whereas there is only one form for both Third
Person Plural (regardless of sex) and Third Person Dual Masculine.
As to the meaning of the members of the Plural Object category,
is must be remarked that in case of a dual object (not including the
speaker or the person addressed) the speaker has a free choice between
forms of this category and those of the Unspecified Object or Masculine
Object categories.
43. The Durative category.","[116, 117]"
"PHONOLOGY2SAs the relation between sand h will be discussed in the next § and
the opposition between s and the other consonants was shown in the
§§ 1 to 10, only the following examples are given here, demonstrating
the opposition between s and zero:
iaflj - asksiaflj - young man
skie - deep
spou - undo
uso - tadpoleHe - hand
pou - blow
uo - nest12. h.h is a voiceless glottal fricative, occurring word-initially and - only
in some verbal and pronominal forms and in some names - wordmedially. If wo·rd-initial and immediately followed by fIj or n, it may
be actualized as a voiceless nasal of the same point of articulation as
the following nasal, so [IJ] or [N] respectively; e.g. hfljari - bird of
paradise, hnaflj - louse, hnum - know.
But many speakers (probably even a majority) never pronounce
word-initial h which is immediately followed by fIj, n, or r, and say ru
for hru - man, etc. Therefore one might say that these speakers have
zero as an allophone of h in this environment. But this reasoning would
do no justice to the fact that the speakers in question do not have any
opposition between words like:
hnaflj - louse,
hno - a place-name.
hrao - carry,and
and
andnaflj - straddle-legged,
no - he, she, they,
rao - sleep,so that for them these pairs of words are just homophonous forms,
whereas an opposition between them does exist for the other speakers.
In fact this a question of coexistence of an older 17 phase, in which
there is opposition between hflj- and fIj-, between hn- and n-, and
between hr- and r-, and a later phase, in which these oppositions do
not exist, so that more homophonous words are found. The line,
separating these two phases, lies in between individual speakers,18
It is not without reluctance and only for want of better terms, that we
introduce words like ""older"" and ""later"" here in our description. Still, we
are fully convinced that, historically, these terms are right, all the evidence,
produced by comparison with closely related languages, pointing in this
direction.
18 We got the impression that the older phase is found mostly with older
speakers, but the dividing line between the two phases certainly does not
coincide precisely with difference of age.
1726TIm NIMBORAN LANGUAGEalthough it is certainly not beyond possibility that the same speakers
use forms of both phases alternately.
As the opposition between h and the other consonants, except s, has
been discussed in the §§ 1 to 10, it remains to speak of the opposition
between hand s and that between h and zero.
As to the opposition between h and zero, just now we saw that in
certain environments this opposition is not found with all speakers.
The remaining cases of word-initial h are those in which h is immediately followed by a vowel. But words having initial h, immediately
followed by i, y, or u,19 do nOit occur, whereas words having initial
e, a, or 0 are very few in number, so that the possibility for minimal
pairs is extremely limited. The only instance found is that of hambot3 horn, and ambot3 - Ambon, Ambonese (a loanword). Another proof
for the existence of the opposition is given by the fact, that dropping
an initial h (which is immediately followed by a vowel) may affect
the recognizability of the word in question: the (non-existing) word
""ake"" would not be accepted by any speaker of Nimboran as being
identical with hake - torch, but is felt to be different.
Instances of opposition between h and zero in word-medial position
are found in verb-forms, e.g.tet3gat3hake - you knocked theretet3gat3ake - you knocked below.","[36, 37, 38]"
"INTRODUCTION3to the ""rules"", already established, and for proofs of the correctness or
fallacy of preliminary conclusions (the latter case receiving her preferential consideration I).
Work with Dina and other informants in Hollandia was kept going
and supplemented by the results of periodical visits to the Nimboran
villages. During these stays usually no systematic procedures were
foUowed and most of the attenibion was given to the unconstrained, freeand-easy, conversation of the villagers which always yielded pointts. for
further investigation. As a matter of fact, it would have been impossible
without observation on the spot to fonn an accurate idea of the
Nimboran people's environmenit, daily life, and culture and correspondingly of the words of their language and ,the contents of their
conversation.
Although collecting traditional tales was not entirely neglected, the
main object always was the study of the living language: detection of
the rules according to which the Nimboran language is spoken. 44There is only one publication giving information on the Nimboran language,
viz. : G. Schneider,Proben der Nimboran-Sprache. Zeitschrift fUr EingeborenenSprachen, XVIII (1927-1928), p. 128-140. We mention this here only as
a matter of curiosity, as it is the result of superficial observation and so full
of errors that it is of very little use.","[16, 17]"

one of the second group, each of these pairs showing the same difference
in form (final u vs. final e) and the same difference in meaning. The
partial difference in meaning, appearing from the use of the words ""I""

follows: in one case - that of the words having final u - the action 11
is attributed to the speaker as the actor; in the other case - that of
the words having final e - the action is attributed to a singular
person addressed, as the actor.
More examples can be found ad libitum; further investigation shows
that the number of such forms is, in principle, unlimited. We have
to do with productive categories whose members are characterized
by the formal elements (morphemes) -u and -e respectively. We call
them the category of the First Person (singular) and the category of
the Second Person (singular).
They appear to be in opposition and are mutually exclusive; so
they are of the same order which we will call the order of the Actor

Actors morphemes of the Apophonic series (and the form of other
morphemes that goes with these Actor morphemes: -de- instead of
-da, -re- instead of -ra-, etc.).
The common semantical element in these words is ""to be in a state,
caused by the action"", or ""to be in a state (denoted by the lexical

All these forms constitute a productive category which counts among
its members words without corresponding forms in the categories of
Unspecified Object, Masculine Object, Plural Object, Durative, Infinitive, and Final Infinitive, but whose root-morphemes are found
among the adjectives. All what is said in § 48 about the connection
of the First Secondary Verb Category with the adjective and the

"Opposed to:
f3guadu - I will bite (here),
f3guakeMu - we two bite above,
f3guatemetJgetim - he is biting repeatedly below,112THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEand all other forms of this verb, discussed so far, we find:1Jgua - 1° (to) bite, 2° bite!, 3° bitten.
There appears to exist a whole series of such forms, e.g. :ki1J - to pack, pack! packed.
Together, they constitute a productive category. Their formal mark
is the absence of any categorial morpheme: they consist of a bare
root-morpheme. The common seman tical element is less easy to
describe. It appears that some heterogeneous semantical elements are
found side by side, distinguishable in the different cases in which the
forms in question are used:
1° just the absence of all the other categorial meanings, in cases like:no po 1Jgua - he wants to bite,
130 l3gua besam - I refuse to bite.
2° a curt order: 1Jgua - bite! For a more polite order, a friendly request
etc. the Second Person Future is used:l3guade - please, bite! have the goodness to bite!
3° a state, caused by being submitted to the action, attributed to a noun:ndie hru me l3gua - that man is already bitten,
hru l3gua be ndie - the bitten man is there.
This use is the same as that of adjectives, e.g.:ndie hru krap6 - that man is bad,
hru krap6 be ndie - the bad man is there.
This category we call the category of the Infinitive.
The indifference of Infinitive forms in regard to the other categories
is seemingly absent in cases like:tao - to put many objects,
dao - to give (take) many objects,
,.au - to roast many objects,
prei - to bring many objects,
as these could be thought to be connected with the Plural Object
category. However, we must assume that these are Infinitives of verbs,113MORPHOLOGYhaving the semantical element of ""many objects"" as part of their lexical
meaning. In the cases of tao, rau, and prei this becomes quite clear
from other forms which, without being Plural Object forms, still
possess the plural object-element in their meaning. The fact that tao,
dao, rau, and prei and words, morphologically related to them, are
used, by way of suppletion (see Ch. I, § 10), instead of the (nonexisting) forms of the Plural Object category of tey - put, tei - take,
give, dey (dy-) - roast, and a series of forms with zero root-morpheme
to which belongs rebedu - I will bring from here to above, respectively,
is not relevant, as the latter have no morphological connections with
the first.
In the examples, cited above, the form of the Infinitive is the same
as that of the root-morpheme in its combinations with the various
morphemes but not the same as the special Singular or Plural stem,
found with some root-morphemes. This appears to be the case with
the great majority of Infinitive forms, e.g.:nC13ga - to light (etc.),
tC13ga13 - to knock (etc.),
sam - to put inbetween (etc.),
skye - to smoke (etc.),
bie - to open (etc.),

"The words which have two accented vowels may be classified in

"The forms of the latter series have in common the element -keimmediately following the root-morpheme and the semantical element
of the duality of the actor. To this must be remarked that the form
fJgudkebdru never can have the meaning ""you and I will bite above""
but exclusively has the meaning of the speaker and somebody (or
something) else as an actor. To this must be added that the form
fJgudkebdre not only has the meaning ""you two will bite above"" but84TIm NIMBORAN LANGUAGEalso ""you (plural) will bite above"". So in this case we find an extra
meaning if compared with the other -ke- -forms. The meaning of
1Jguakebaram is such that it can only be used if the actor consists
of two male beings, whereas the form 1Jguakebarum is used if the
actor is dual, does not include the speaker or the person addressed,
and does not consist of two persons of the male sex. Therefore, the
actor of 1Jguakebarum may be one male and one female being, two
female beings, etc.
Precisely the same formal element combined with the same semantical characteristics are found with:1Jguakebau ~ we two bite (bit) above,
1Jguakebake - you (two, plural) bit above,
1Jguakesaram - they two (male) will bite there,
1Jguakesom - they two (not exclusively male) bite (bit) there,

pripkebenanom - they two (not excl. male) throw (threw) from
below to above, from there to above, from far
away to above,

"The Tense forms discussed in the preceding Section can be opposed
to still other forms, e.g. 13guadu, 13g1£at1£, and 13guaku to 13guapu - I bit.
This word is formally characterized by the morpheme -p-, preceding
the Actor morpheme, and its meaning shows the feature ""the action
took place in the past but not before yesterday"". With precisely the
same difference in meaning we find opposed to 13guade, 13guadam,
13guadum, etc., 13guape, 13guapam, and 139uapum; opposed to bekddu
etc., bekdPu etc.; opposed to te13gandu etc., tC13gampu etc.; opposed to
13grundu etc., 13grumpu etc.; opposed to u6du etc., u6pu etc.
Again, we have to do with a productive category; we call it the
category of the Recent Past. As it appears to be in opposition with
Tense categories, it is of the same order.
To the description of the semantic value of the Recent Past category
must be added that members of this category are also used for denoting
actions, performed in a past more remote than the preceding day, this
to indicate a difference of time in the past. Thus, in a narrative, told
with verb-forms of the Past Tense, a form of the Recent Past may
be introduced to refer to some event that happened at a time, later
than that in which the rest of the story is set.",[70]
"As the categories we came across in the §§ 9 to 12 show mutual
opposition, they are of the same order which we call the order of the
P 0 sit ion cat ego r i e s.
The forms which do not show a formal mark as to ""position"", e.g.
1Jguaku etc., also have their place in this connection. Semantically,
they are not as un-characterized as they seemed to be. A form like
13guaku, if opposed to 13guabaku, 1Jgua13aku, etc., has the meaning ""I bit
here"" or - in a more general formula - it contains the semantic
element ""in the place where the speaker is"". Therefore, these forms
may be said to be members of a Position category with zero morpheme.
We call this the First Position category. Members of this category
are always used in those cases in which the place of the action in
regard to the speaker's position is indefinite or does not playa role,
e.g. in stories, general statements, and the like.
I t must be observed that in some cases the lexical meaning of a
morphological set asks for an a d hoc adaptation of the categoric
meanings of the Position categories, as described in the §§ 9 to 13.
E.g. in forms with the root-morpheme kri- (flee) or with the rootmorpheme uauy- (take along) the position category does not denote
the place w her e but the place fro m w her e the flight or the
taking takes place.
14. Morphonoiogical remarks in connection with the
Position categories.",[74]
"Some proper names, having more than two
vowels, may have - apart from ,the fixed, primary, accent a
secondary accent on a certain VI)wel, preceding the vowel which
has the primary accent. In ~hese cases the two accents are no1
interchangeable. The secondary accent may be absent; this usually
~s the case in fast speech. In writing, this secondary aocent will be
indicated with a grave accent (~), e.g. masdtekdte - mythological
name, hdmot3greintYr> - a field-name, hamongrat3 - name of a village.3° the w '0 r d sam sam. In this word, which means ""slow, in
order"", the two vowds are equally accentuated so that formally
it corresponds with a repeated word like kend6 kend6 - quick (!).
But samsam can not be called such a repeated word, as a simple
form sam does not occur. 29
Therefore, it is impossible to use the accent for the distinction of the word
in Nimboran. Cf. what is said about this by Joseph H. Greenberg in his ""Essays
in Linguistics"", Chigaco, 1957, esp. p. 31-32.
27 For the terms ""morpheme"" and ""root-morpheme"", see Part Two, Ch. I.
28 See Part Two, Ch. II, § 9.
29 A word sam really exists but its meaning is totally different so that it hardly
can be connected with samsam.
26PHONOLOGY39It may be said that all words, having two accents, constitute border
cases between single words and groups, consisting of two separate
words. This view is supported by the fact that consonant-sequences,
which are not found elsewhere, occur in many such words as morphemejunction-markers (s·ee Oh. VI, §§ 2, 3, 4 and 10). They are treated
here as words because of their inseparability.
4. Words without an accent.","[50, 51]"
"MORPHOLOGY121heni buen - meager body,
'30 buendatu - I become meager,
hru iaua - a grown-up man,
no iauadakum - she grew up.
In such cases the meaning is ""get into the state (which is denoted
by the lexical meaning)"".
In § 46 we saw that Infinitives may have the function of adjectives.
In other words, the Infinitive form is a means to make verbs into
adjectives. As those members of the category in question which have
corresponding forms in the verbal categories, enumerated above, always
have the form of the Infinitive as the form of their root-morpheme, it
may be said that the Infinitive is the connecting link between that
category and the other categories. The other members which correspond
with adjectives only make it clear that this has something to do with
the adjectival function of the Infinitive.
For this reasons we call this category a Secondary verbal category
and, as it is not the only one of this kind, we call it the First Secondary
Verb Category.
There is one series of forms, belonging to this category, viz.
remedaru - I will change, become transformed (here),
etc., etc.,
the root-morpheme of which (reme-) is not found otherwise.
Moreover, all forms of this category occur with zero root-morpheme:
daru or raru - I will become (here),
etc., etc.
The lexical meaning of this forms is ""become"".
49. The Second Secondary Verb Category.","[130, 131]"
"Having mentioned the semantic element that is common to the
members of a category, we now have to state this view more fully.
For in certain cases the members of a category are distinguished from
correlated words not so much by an element of meaning as by a
difference in syntactic val e n c e. 4 By this term is meant: systematic
combinability with other words; e.g., the English words sings and
singer (in: The man sings a song and The man is a good singer) have
different syntactic valence (and therefore are not interchangeable). As
a common syntactic valence and a common element of meaning do not
exclude each other - the latter is even usually found in combination
with the former - , we may say that members of a category have in
common: an element of form
an element of meaning and/or
syntactic valence.",[62]
"It is not surprising that foreign words, used in Nimboran speech,
often show forms which do not fit in with the Nimboran phonological
system. Indeed, these words are still regarded as foreign. Therefore,
they may be left out of our description and it also is not feasible to
include them in a dictionary as their number is indefinite.
The case is different, if the form of a foreign word is adapted to the
structure of Nimboran and so loses the outward characteristics of its
origin. An examination of this process of adaptation may deepen our
insight into the phonological structure of Nimboran and that is why a
special chapter is devoted to loan-words and also why especially adapted
forms receive attention.
As adaptation of foreign forms is a process, progressing in time,
words in different stages of adaptation can be found at the same time.
Even different stages of adaptation of the same word can occur
simultaneously. Moreover, the process of adaptation may sometimes go
in different directions, so that the result may be more than one adapted

"The last two examples show that original final k 1S lost. This
appears to be the rule, e.g. bre - tin (Dutch blik); bebe - duck
(Mal. bebek).
Word-final s or t of foreign words is usually retained, a final e being
added, e.g.
kase - coffin (NGM kas, from Dutch kast).
kertase, kratase - paper (Mal. kertas).
tomate, te11Uite - tomato (Dutch tomaat).

addition of final i in nanasi - pine-apple (Mal. nanas);
loss of final s in bra - rice (NGM bras);
loss of final t in d6i - money (Mal. duit). It is possible that these three
words did not come directly from MaL, so that some other language,
which served as an intermediary, is responsible for the irregularity of
the changes.
Final n of foreign words usually becomes 13, e.g.
ambo13 - Ambon, Ambonese, from Ambon,
nipu13 - Japan, Japanese, from Nipon,
mentimu13 - cucumber (lndon. mentimun),38
sabu13, but also sabun - soap (Mal. sabun).","[57, 58]"
"VIPREFACEWarm thanks are also due to Dr. E. M. Uhlenbeck and Dr. H.
Schultink for their important suggestions and constructive criticism
of which, I hope, I have gratefully taken advantage.
It is impossible to mention the names of all those who in some way
or other have been helpful. Above all, this is true for the Nimboran
people whose assistance, willingness, hospitality, and patience were
essential for the success of my work. I will hold them in grateful
remembrance for the rest of my life.","[5, 6]"
"PHONOLOGY45pesta - feast (Indon. pesta, NGM festa).
pepaia - pawpaw (Indon. pepaja).
pandai - shotgun, rifle. This word, originally Spanish, must havecome from one of the languages of eastern Indonesia. The final i
makes it probable that the Biak language served as an intermediary.
spatu, sepatu - shoe. Of these two forms, probably ;the former is
NGM spatu and the latter Indon. sepatu. 36
kitap - book (Mal. kitab).37
kasbi - manioc (NGM kasbi).
The u of Mal. words is often replaced by Nimboran y. This may
be due to th~ phonetic difference between rounded Mal. u and the
unrounded u of Nimboran. E.g. S)lsy - milk (Mal. susu).
Maybe in the same circumstance the cause is to be found of the
change of a of some Mal. words into u, e.g. prup - cork (NGM prop).
But ;the reverse is also found, e.g. ba'Yjko - bank (Mal. bangku).
Change of k into g is found in sema'Yjga - watermelon (Citrullus
vulgaris) (Mal. semangka).
The lamino-alveolars are usually ""analysed"" to apico-dentals plus
following i, e.g.
kasia'Yj - legume (Mal. katjang).
siepatu - shoe (NGM tjepatu).
ensie - sir (used to address a Chinese) NGM entje, Indon. entjik).
media, media - table (Mal. medja).
(undy) radio - kind of banana (Mal. (pisang) radja).
bania - many (Mal. banjak).
minia (but also mina) - oil (Mal. minjak).","[56, 57]"
"As has been said before, the members of a morphological category
show a common formal feature. This formal feature becomes apparent
from the comparison with morphologically related words (co-members
of morphological sets), belonging to other categories, e.g., English
worker vs. worked, walker vs. walked, etc. In this example there is
an opposition between words having one categoric morpheme (-er) and
words with a different categoric morpheme.
However, in many cases the formal opposition is found in the
presence of a certain formal feature in the one case and its absence
in the other; e.g., English work and walk as opposed to working and
In our morphological description we will regularly add a translation to the
words under discussion. This translation usually contains only a superficial
indication of the lexical meaning. A more detailed description of the meanings
will be found in the vocabulary in the second volume.

"40TliE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEformal differences, or in the use of their members, need not be discussed
here, as there is no connection 32 between their resemblance of their
forms and the identity of their meaning. They will be found in the
dictionary. Just by way of illustration, some examples are given here;dekuam and rekuam - meat
neikao and keikao - narrow
brou'l3ye and brou'l3gye - cuscus
mere and mero - kind of red dye
minie and mi'l3gie - before, formerly

kietendy and skietendy - aill, always

The remaining cases, which are discussed in this chapter, fall into
three groups;
1° s pee d - a 1 t ern ant s. These are pairs of words one member
of which is used in fast speech only.
2° con d i t ion e d a 1t ern ant s. These are pairs of words of
which one member occurs only in a certain syntactical or phonemical
environment.
3° f r e e a 1 t ern ant s. In these pairs of words the members do
not show any regularity in their use but their formal differences
a:re found in more than one case and so they are parallel in their
formal characteristics.
2. Speed-alternants.","[51, 52]"
"The members of this category are characterized by an element -myene
immediately following the root-morpheme. The y of this morpheme has
the accent. The common element of meaning is ""to, at"", so that the
members have the same syntactical valence as phrases consisting of a
substantive and the postposition ne, like iam6 ne - to the house, e.g.

1. i.i is a voiced high close front unrouded vocoid. It occurs word-initially,

3° if immediately followed by a second i which has no accent 9: sfi squeeze, biiJab - good.
Some speakers, very few in number, sometimes replace a word-final
i which has no accent and is immediately preceded by i or e, by a voiced
back dorso-velar stop [G] and actualize na13grei - three, as [naI3greG],
iii - divide, as [jiG], etc. 10
The contrastive value of i in opposition to other vowe~s and zero
appears from the following instances 11 :iSLe - forest-hen

keni - hearing
ki - woman

9 This is contrary to Trubetzkoy's ""4'h rule"", according to which two related
sound-units, occurring in complementary distribution, may not be regarded
as allophones of one phoneme, if they occur side by side (N. S. Trubetzkoy,
Grundziige der Phonologie, Prague, 1939, p. 46). The rightness of this rule
has already been challenged by Andre Martinet (Bulletin de la Societe de
Linguistique de Paris, XLII, 1946, p. 32).
10 Most speakers avoid this, because they regard it as an undignified imitation
of the Gresi language which is closely related/to Nimboran. However, it can
be safely assumed that, historically, this final i developed from a consonant.
I I Setting against each other words with minimal differences in sound-shape
(minimal pairs) is common practice in phonological descriptions. In this way,
however, words are placed in a very abnormal position (see: H. Mol and
E. M. Uhlenbeck, o.c.).
