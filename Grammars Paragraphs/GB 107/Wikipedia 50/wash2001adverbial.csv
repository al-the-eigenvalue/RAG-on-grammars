STV-fall.from-PST=?ap<into the back yard of the house.>The 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause in (7) line d. is a Barbareno
example of what Thompson and Longacre (1985:182-183) refer to as a
'before' clause. The event in a 'before' clause has not yet happened by the
time that the event denoted by the main clause has happened. Thompson and
Longacre argue that, for this reason, the event named in the 'before' clause
is conceptually negative from the point of view of the main clause event. For
this reason, it is not unusual to find a morpheme of negation or negative
polarity (e.g. English any or ever) in a 'before' clause. In Barbareho, the
negative prefix e- occurs in the main verb of the 2akimpi 'during' clause.","[165, 166]"
"Of the 53 u clauses, 12 or 23% have the negative prefix e-. They
always translate with the phrase 'so that... not..'. These adverbial clauses
tend to be associated with main clauses that code deontic necessity. That is,
the participant coded as the main clause subject is obliged to do something in
order to avoid an unpleasant result. In most cases, the main clause subject is
second person singular, indexed on the verb with the second person prefix p-.
The main clause will also typically have the modal verb uniyiw 'to be
necessary, to have to, should' as well as the future tense prefix sa?-.
Illustrations of this pattern are given in (20) through (22).
The main clause in (20) line c. states what one ought to do if beans fell
on the floor. The Gu purpose clause in line d. has the negative prefix e-.

"289Chapter 13ku ‘lest; so that...not' ClausesThompson and Longacre (1985:188) note that some languages have a
special conjunction for negative purpose clauses. An example in English is the
negative purpose conjunction ‘lest '. In Barbarenho Chumash, that conjunction
is ku 'lest, so that..not'. The Ku adverbial clause type is rare, with only two
tokens in the corpus. Yet, it is worth a brief discussion because it shares some
semantic space with negated Gu 'so that, in order to' purposive clauses
(chapter 11) as well as with haku '‘if' conditional clauses (chapter 7).
The ku conjunction probably has a historical connection with the
conjunction haku 'if', found in conditional and semantically neutral relations.
Adverbial clauses with the conjunctions ku and haku are alike in that both
clause types code unreal, hypothetical situations. But whereas haku clauses
may code a condition, ku clauses code the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action. Specifically with ku clauses, the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action is to avoid an undesirable situation.
It is not entirely clear what the difference in meaning would be for a
purpose clause that has the ku conjunction versus a clause that has the Gu
'so that, in order to' conjunction and the negative prefix e-. In line c. of the
first example below, Mary Yee offered two ways of saying a purposive clause
in which these two conjunctions were contrasted. Harrington noted that these
minimal pairs were ‘carefully contrasted' (59.0586), but he did not state
whether Yee preferred one over the other.

"The conditional clause ‘if Domi hadn’t (come)' has negation in the form of
the contraction -n’t on the verb had. Negation in Barbareno Chumash always
appears in the form of the prefix -e-. As we will see shortly, in the
counterfactual conditional clause in (9) line f., this negative prefix is seen in
the verb s-e-2u8""02-was '{if] she hadn’t let (him)'.
In the narrative below there are three preposed conditional clauses.
The first one (line a.) sets the scene with the hypothetical scenario of an old
man wanting to hold a baby. The second preposed conditional clause (line c.)
explores a possible option within this hypothetical scenario, one in which the
old man has some kind of power in his blood that would necessitate him
holding the baby for only a brief moment. Finally, the counterfactual
conditional clause in line f. gives a counter-consideration, a hypothetical
scenario in which the mother had not let the old man hold the baby at all, and
all the consequences that would result from that.

"TheNo les gusta agua salada [<they don’t like salt water>].conditionalclausein lined.‘butif theydon’tcomedown',hassignificant lexical overlap with the clause that immediately precedes it, ' they
come down right away'. It thus establishes an explicit contrast with the
preceding material. The second contrastive conditional, '[Because] if they
don’t escape the freshet' (line f.), does not explicitly link up to anything in the
prior text. It establishes a contrast with the implicit assumption, in the
preceding discourse, that the salamanders instinctively know to escape the
freshet by climbing up the hill before a big rain and staying on the hill until
the rain stops.
Negation that is involved in establishing contrasts does not necessarilyhave to appear in the conditional clause, as it does in examples (9) and (10).
For example, in (11) line b., the negative prefix e- appears in an independent
clause, preceding the conditional clause in line c.

strangers, but in line c. we see that, under certain conditions,she quicklyopened the door. The conditional clause in line c. introduces the hypothetical

salient temporal boundary denoted in the adverbial clause in line b.
Sometimes in a maii clause construction there is no specific
morphology, in either the adverbial clause or the main clause, that indicates
a temporal relation. I still posit a temporal relation, however, if the mali
clause contains a word that specifies the time frame. This would satisfy
criterion (iii). For example in the text in (3), which is a procedural text aboutmaking posoli, the word ‘it is morning’ establishes the time frame in which

tense-aspect marking in the adverbial clause, the adverbial clause conjunction
is not semantically specific, and there is no lexical item within the adverbial
that indicates a time frame, a temporal interpretation of the adverbial clause
is still possible if the pragmatics of the context demands it. In these cases, I
also apply a process of elimination by seeing, for example, if the adverbial
clause makes just as much sense with a conditional interpretation, or a reason
interpretation, etc. In (4) and (5) there are two adverbial clauses from the
same procedural text, both of which happen to be minimal pairs. The version
in (4) appears to be a constructed sentence. The two adverbial conjunctions
in question, mali 'when' ((4) line d.) and wa ‘if; when' ((5) line c.) are
semantically non-specific. Both adverbial clauses have a temporal
interpretation in this context, however, because the context does not permitany other interpretation.

drying process is something that happens to the wooden bowl, as a matter of
course, after the coating of lard has been applied. A conditional interpretation
is therefore not possible with the adverbial clauses in (4) and (5), even though
the adverbial conjunction wa, in (5), can occur in clauses that have a
conditional interpretation. Only a temporal relation is acceptable for this
token.
1.9.2.2 Neutral relations
Sometimes none of the three criteria discussed above for temporal
clauses apply, nor does the context render a specific semantic interpretation.
In such cases, the would-be temporal clause can also have a conditional
meaning. Adverbial clauses in these cases are semantically neutral with respect
to conditionality and time. Two examples of neutralized adverbial clauses, a
na clause and a mali clause, are seen below in (6).

2-thoughtno se echa de ver que tienes mal pensamiento. '
<the fact that your thoughts are bad is not evident.>The adverbial clauses in lines a. and c. do not show clear evidence of
being temporal clauses or conditional clauses. For example, unlike most mali
clauses that have a temporal relation to the main clause, the mali clause in
line c. has no morphosyntax or lexical items that link the event in the main
clause to a specific time frame. Both the na and mali 'ifAvhen' clauses code
generic, habitual situations. The temporal and conditional relations are
conflated for those tokens. Neutralization of conditionality and time is
discussed briefly in Thompson and Longacre 1985:193. Most researchers put
neutral, 'ifAwhen' clauses into the conditional category (e.g. Thompson (p.c.),
Comrie1986, ter Meulen1986, Hacker 1998). In this dissertation, however,I treat neutral 'iffwhen' clauses as belonging to a category separate from the
conditional and temporal semantic categories.
1.9.2.3 Conditional relationsGenerally, an adverbial clause that provides the condition(s) under
which the event/state in the main clause occurs is analyzed in this dissertation
as a conditional clause. However, as discussed earlier, conditional relations canbe conflated with temporal relations in Barbareno, with the result that the
clause in question may not be a true conditional clause, even if it has an
adverbial conjunction that Harrington translates as ‘if’. In identifying a
21conditional clause, then, I looked for the following factors: (i) the adverbial
clause must code a hypothetical, i.e. unreal, situation; and, (ii) the main clause
must have one or more of the following features (following Givén 1990:829)
all of which underscore the irrealis nature of conditional constructions: the
modal verb uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should', the modal verb
alaqway‘can, to be able', the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particlemay ‘would, should', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa ‘must be,
must have', the hortative particle kuhhe 'let it not be (that)', the particle
kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect request, or a
question. Negation in the main clause was another criterion I considered, since
in some languages all clauses that have negation are treated as irrealis (T.
Payne 1997). I decided not to treat negation as one of the structural criteria
in the identification of a conditional relation. However, in those cases whereI gave a conditional interpretation based on a pragmatic interpretation of the
context, i.e. where none of the above structural criteria were found in theassociated main clause, it was almost always the case that the main clause had
negation. These judgment calls were rare, however.
Following Givén (1990:831) a counterfactual conditional relation was
identified as one in which: (i) the adverbial clause has a firm and negative
truth-value; (ii) the adverbial clause has a realis operator such as the past
tense suffix -wa5; and finally, (iii) the main clause has an irrealis operator
such as future tense or a modal particle. Counterfactual clauses are rare in my
corpus, however.
The passage below has several conditional clauses: a conditional na
clause (line a.), a conditional haku clause (line c.), and a counterfactualconditional haku clause (line f.).

is no case marking on nouns. Grammatical relations show a nominativeaccusative pattern. There are no canonical adpositions or adjectives. There is
significant prefixing on both verbs and nouns. Suffixation does occur, but not
to the same extent. The basic morphological structure of the verb and noun
is covered in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively.
2.2.1The verb
.
The Barbareho Chumash verb is polymorphemic. The core of the verb
is the verb stem, which is usually a combination of morphemes fused together
over time. (See section 2.2.1.6.) The stem usually has several prefixes and
suffixes. Figure 1 shows the overall configuration of the Barbarenho Chumash
verb. The affixes toward the top of each column are inflectional and occur
furthest out from the stem, while those closer to the bottom are more
derivational and often form part of the stem itself.

41OF SUFFIXES2.2.1.1Person and number
Pronominal affixes show a nominative-accusative pattern. As Ono
(1996) has argued, these affixes are truly referential pronouns. They should
not be thought of as agreement markers, which serve only to copy certain
features of independent NPs. An utterance can be complete with just the verb
and its affixes, because the pronominal affixes already indicate who or what
is being talked about.
The prefixes index the subject of the verb, distinguishing three persons
(first, second, and third person) and four numbers (singular, dual, plural, and
indefinite or unspecified). Table 5 lists the subject pronominal prefixes.

Pronominal suffixes index the object of the verb if the object is first
person, second person, or non-singular third person. The object suffixes do not
distinguish dual and plural. Singular third person objects are not indexed onthe verb.! Table 6 lists the object suffixes.

Emphatic glottalization is often encliticized onto the final syllable, and an
epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.

fact is illustrated below with the third person subject pronoun, s-. In (119),

is indicated with the prefix sa2-. The past tense is formally marked with the
suffix ~waS. In Barbareho Chumash these tenses are relative (Mithun 1996,
1999). Thus the reference pointto a future time or a past time can be either
the moment of speech or a time under discussion, as in a narrative time line.
Below are some examples of future tense and past tense marking.

of there being the power of a spirit helper in the old man’s blood. The main
clause of this adverbial construction is in line e. It denotes the situation that
is supposed to occur, i.e: that the old man should quickly hand the child back
to its mother, if the hypothetical situation stated in the haku 'if' clause
applies. The main clause in line e. has both the modal verb uniyiw ‘to be
necessary, to have to, should' and the future tense morpheme sa?-. Both of
these morphemes are irrealis operators which underscore the conditional
meaning of that adverbial clause construction.

The only token of a counterfactual conditional haku 'if*' clause occurs
in line f., ""if she had not let the old manhold the child’. It has severalfeatures that identify it as a counterfactual conditional clause (following Givén
1990:831). First, the adverbial clause assumes a firm, not-pending, truth-value;178its meaning assumes that the mother did indeed let the old man hold the
baby. Also importantly, the adverbial clause has a negative truth-value, in that
it posits a hypothetical scenario that did not happen. Another criterion that

operators typically found in a counterfactual clause. Finally, the main clause
in line g. has an irrealis operator, the verb s-apaékaws ‘it is fast and
unforeseen; it happens quick and unexpectedly'. This verb makes reference
to the fact that a future event, a necessarily unplanned for event, will happen.
Another kind of irrealis operator often found in the main clause of a
conditional relation is a modal particle (Givén 1990:829). Two illustrations of
the Barbareho modal particle may ‘would; should; might' are given in (2)and (3) below. In (2) we see a postposed haku 'if' clause. Its main clause

"1.3 Sources of primary data
The data in this study come primarily from John P. Harrington’s
manuscript materials of linguistic and ethnographic work among the Chumash
people. These are catalogued in Mills and Brickfield 1986. Harrington’s notes
and recordings are the largest primary source of data for all of the Chumash
languages. From his work on the Barbarenho language alone he produced tens
of thousands of pages of field notes. From 1913 until a few years before his
death in 1961, Harrington worked with some of the last known speakers of
Barbareno. The best known of these were Luisa Ignacio, Juliana Ignacio, Juande Jesus Justo, Lucrecia Garcia, and Mary Yee. All of these people were
bilingual in Barbareho and Spanish; Mary Yee was also fluent in English. In
addition, Lucrecia Garcia and Mary Yee were able to read and write in
Barbareho. The data used in my study are mostly from the texts and
grammatical notes recorded by Harrington on paper from Mary Yee. Data
from other speakers will be cited when necessary.
During the time of his fieldwork, Harrington recorded languages on
paper, wax cylinders and aluminum discs. Convenient tools such as magnetic
tape recorders were not available until late in his career. He used a detailed
but idiosyncratic phonetic transcription when writing down a language, andoften did not write phonemically.? The consensus among linguists who knowHarrington’s work is that he had an extraordinarily acute ear for phoneticdetail (Callaghan1975,1976). ThusHarrington’s written recordingsofAmerican Indian languages are valued by present-day linguists for their
accuracy and reliability.
A second corpus of primary discourse data comes from Madison
Beeler, who worked with Mary Yee during a series of field trips from about
1954 through the early 1960s. To my knowledge, this corpus contains several
dozen notebooks and nine tape recordings.
William Bright worked with Mary Yee for a brief period in 1952. His
notes consist of wordlists and short paradigms.
There are other primary sources of data on Chumash languages. These
sources are primarily wordlists recorded in the 1700s and 1800s. The more
well-known of these were recorded by Arroyo de la Cuesta in 1833-36, Pinart
in 1878 (published in Heizer 1952), and Henshaw in 1884 (published in Heizer
1955).
1.4 Previous analyses of Barbareno Chumash*
A truly thorough description of the Barbareho Chumash language has
yet to appear, but one may find a clear and concise orientation to Barbareno4discourse and grammar in Ono’s 1996 dissertation. Sketches and analyses of
the Barbareno language are also found in Beeler 1970a and 1976, and in the
extensive, detailed footnotes given in Beeler and Whistler 1980. Detailed
discussions on dependent marking, relative clauses and related structures are
given in Wash 1999a and 1999b. There are also discussions and illustrative
examples touching upon many aspects of Barbareho grammar in Harrington’s
notes, especially in Reel 3, Volume 3, of the Kraus Microfilm Reel Edition(Mills and Brickfield 1986). In addition to these sources there are two articles
on the placement and functions of glottalization (Mithun et al. 1994, Ono et
al. 1994). Two studies have been published on sibilant harmony in Barbareho
(Beeler 1970b, Mithun 1997). Finally, there is a phonological study on
reduplication, which is a prominent phonological and grammatical process in
all Chumash languages (Wash 1995).
No comprehensive dictionary of the Barbareno language has yet been
published. However, Beeler (1979) published a list of approximately 1,000
words, Whistler (1980) followed up on this work with a working dictionary
containing about 2,000 words. There is also a helpful glossary of terms from
several different Chumash languages. in volume five of the Hudson and
Blackburn (1986) series.
1.5 Theoretical orientation
This dissertation is based on a functionally-oriented approach to
linguistics. A functionally-oriented approach seeks to understand language in
all of its cognitive, communicative, socio-cultural and diachronic aspects. It is
the complex way in which these aspects of language interact that accounts for
the patterns observed in human languages, both individually and on a crosslinguistic basis. The complex interaction of these aspects of language is best
seen in the ways language is actually used. Hence, when linguists who follow
this approach seek to describe and explain why certain forms or structures
pattern as they do in a given language, they want to work with as much
context of the language as possible. They seek to have a database that is built
upon connected discourse rather than only single forms and structures elicited
out of context, the latter being the standard for some schools of linguistics.
Thus if the language under investigation has a community of speakers, a
functionally-oriented linguist will seek to record as many genres of naturally
occurring discourse as possible, including conversation and the telling of
stories. Such recordings are audiotaped and/or videotaped, and are
subsequently transcribed in a systematic way (e.g. Du Bois et al. 1993). From
such data, both qualitative analyses (e.g. Chafe 1980) and quantitative analyses
5(e.g. Givén 1983, Du Bois 1987, Fox and Thompson 1990 and Ford 1993
among many others) are possible.
One broad area of functional approaches to linguistics that is used in
this dissertation is the theory of INFORMATION FLOW (Chafe1976, 1987,1992,1994). According to this theory, the changing cognitive state of information in
the minds of the speaker and hearer motivate particular linguistic forms and
structures. For example, newly mentioned referents are commonly coded as
full NPs, because in this form the hearer is able to identify who the speaker
is talking about. Subsequent mentions of the same referent usually take
pronominal form, e.g. English 'he', 'she', 'it'. These forms of the referent
reflect its Given cognitive status. This theory is particularly helpful in part four
of this dissertation as we examine the relationship between mentions of
referents and clausal ordering in adverbial clause constructions.
The theory of information flow is connected to some extent to the
principle of least effort in the production and processing of language (Zipf
1935). This principle, along with the functionally-oriented notion of iconic and
economic motivation in language (Haiman 1983) will be shown to be relevant
in understanding the various patterns one finds with initial and final adverbial
clauses in Barbareno discourse, in parts three and four of the dissertation.
1.6 Literature review
Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. Thistopic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals withconstructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he
6gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"CONJ=finally3-poisonDP=DIS=ART=motherand will poison the mother. '
<and finally poison the mother.>In (7) line a., the na clause meets the criteria of being a conditional
clause. First, it denotes a hypothetical situation, ‘if an old man wants to holda baby', which serves as a condition under which the proposition in the main
23clause holds. Second, its main clause in line b. has the modal particle may
‘would,should',whichfurtherunderscorestheirrealismeaningof theadverbial clause construction.
The second conditional clause is seen in line c. Here, the haku clause
codes the hypothetical situation of there being supernatural power in the old
man’s blood. The main clause of this adverbial construction is in line e. It
denotes the situation that is supposed to occur, i.e. that the old man should
quickly hand the child back to its mother, if the hypothetical situation stated
in the haku clause applies. The main clause in line e. has both the modal verb
uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have to, should' and the future tense morpheme
sa2-. Both of these morphemes are irrealis operators which underscore the
conditional meaning of that adverbial clause construction.
Finally, a counterfactual conditional clause occurs in line f., ‘if she hadnot let the old man hold the child‘. I analyze it as a counterfactual clause
according to the factors mentioned earlier. First, the adverbial clause assumes
a firm (not-pending) truth-value; its meaning assumes that the mother did
indeed let the old man hold the baby. Also importantly, the adverbial clausehas a negative truth-value, in that it posits a hypothetical scenario that did not
happen. Another criterion that identifies this as a counterfactual conditional
is that it has the past tense marker -wa&. According to Givén 1990, this is one
of the realis operators typically found in a counterfactual clause. Finally, the
main clause in line g. has an irrealis operator, the verb s-apa¢kaw8 ‘it is
fast and unforeseen; it happens quick and unexpectedly'. This verb makes
reference to the fact that a future event, a necessarily unplanned for event,
will happen.
1.9.2.4 Concessive relations
I categorized an adverbial clause as a concessive clause if, as Givén
states, the adverbial clause involves' ...a presupposed contrast or counter-expectancy, with the ADV-clause
supplying the grounds for the counter-expectation, and the main clause
supplying the less-likely event or state (1990:835).
In Barbareno Chumash, the only structural feature that concessive adverbial
clauses have in common is the conjunction 2iyeme, which Harrington has
translated as ‘though; even if'. A prototypical example of a concessive
adverbial clause is seen in (8) line c.","[45, 46]"

verb would have had the form *s-e-sa2?-2uqpatin, and we would not haveseen the epenthetic glottal stop preceding the negative prefix ein ineas it doeshThe lack of subject marking in different-subject Gukanu clauses is
further illustrated in (13). The main clause subject in line a. is a man, indexed
on the verb with the third person pronoun s-. He is making a particular kind
of bowl called a stuk. The Gukanu clause subject in line b. is the stuk itself.
The adverbial clause pronoun s- is not retained, because the main clausesubject (the stuk maker) has complete control over what happens to the
adverbial clause subject (the stuk) in the adverbial clause event. ((Cf. alsoexample (3), which is a similar example from the same text.)

"CONJ=finally3-poisonDP=DIS=ART=motherand will poison the mother.’<and finally poison the mother.>An important part of establishing the contrast involves lexical overlap.
The conditional clause repeats the targeted information given earlier in the
discourse and then negates the relevant part of that information. The result
of the change brought about by the negation is then treated in the clauses that
follow the counterfactual clause. In these ways, the conditional clauses links
the information that follows it with the information that came earlier in the
discourse. For example in (9) line f. above, the counterfactual clause repeats
several of the same words found in line b.: the verbs for ""let! and 'hold' and
the nouns for 'old man' and 'child'. Because of the lexical overlap, the
434propositions expressed by lines b. 'the mother should let the old man hold the
child' and f. tif she had not let the old man hold the child’ are nearly the
same, except in line f. the proposition is negated. The counterfactual clause
in f. further develops the discourse by linking back to clause in b. via this
lexical overlap and creating a contrast with it.
Not all contrastive conditional clauses have explicit ties to the
preceding context via lexical overlap. The text in (10) has two contrastive
conditional clauses. The first one (line d.) has explicit links to material given
earlier in the text, but the second contrastive conditional (line f.) does not.

All complement clauses follow the matrix verb. They are finite in that
they are inflected for person. Sometimes they are inflected for tense and
aspect. Forms of the complementizer may vary. In most cases, the dependent
proclitic hi= links the complement clause to its matrix verb. A less common
complementizer is Gu, which is historically related to the purposive adverbial
conjunction Gu ‘so that, in order to' and the general conjunction Gu ‘and;
but; such that'. Finally, in rare tokens, the complementizer is ka=. Below areexamples of complement-taking predicates together with their complement
clauses.

"556Part VConcluding Remarks557Chapter 24Concluding RemarksIn this dissertation I described and explained the various patterns one
finds in the grammar of adverbial clauses in Barbareno Chumash, from a
functionally-oriented perspective of language. I used thirteen, structurallydistinguishable adverbial clause types as a starting point. I gave a detailed
account of the kinds of semantic relations coded by these adverbial clause
types and the morphosyntactic patterns one finds associated with the semantic
relations within each clause type. I then compared the initial and final tokens
of these types with respect to similarities and differences in structure, extent
of scope, and punctuation/intonation boundaries. Finally, I focussed on the
similarities and differences in discourse functions between initial and final
clauses that code purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral
relations.
It is interesting to consider the areas of adverbial clause grammar
where Barbareno Chumash differs from other languages, the areas of
adverbial clause grammar where it shows striking similarities with other
languages, and why it is that the differences and similarities appear where they
do. For example, Barbareno Chumash grammar codes the same kinds of
semantic relations one finds in other languages: temporal, conditional, neutral
(which many researchers treat as conditional), concessive, manner,
reason/causal, and purposive. Many languages code these semantic categories
in adverbial clauses, but the ways in which they code them can be quite
different. To illustrate this point, I will highlight some of the differences with
regard to temporal and conditional/neutral relations.
English has the conjunctions before and after, which denote respectively
a precedence (posteriority) relation, where the main clause event precedes the
adverbial clause event, and a subsequence (anteriority) relation, where the
main clause event occurs subsequent to the adverbial clause event. Barbareno
Chumash does not have temporal conjunctions that mean 'before' or
‘after’, but instead uses the general, non-temporally specific conjunction
mali 'when' in both cases, in combination with other morphosyntax that
further specifies the temporal relation. Thus in terms of the variety of
temporal conjunctions that can be used to code precedence and subsequence
temporal relations, English is more explicit than Barbareno Chumash.
558In coding conditional/neutral relations, languages differ in the extent to
which their adverbial conjunctions code degrees of hypotheticality and the
speaker’s expectation about the likelihood that an event can or will occur.
English codes the distinction with two conjunctions: if and when. The
conjunction if indicates a lower degree of probability and expectation, or
higher degree of hypotheticality, and the conjunction when indicates a higher
degree of probability and expectation, or lower degree of hypotheticality. On
the other hand, Barbareho Chumash has three adverbial conjunctions that
code distinctions of hypotheticality and expectation. Events that denote the
lowest probability of ever occurring (= highest degree of hypotheticality) are
coded with the conjunction haku ‘if'. Events that have the most probability
of occurring (= lowest degree of hypotheticality) are coded with the
conjunction mali 'when'. Events that fall in the middle of the scale of
probability, expectation and hypotheticality are coded with the conjunction na
‘if; when'.","[578, 579, 580, 581]"
"Though there were not enough tokens of the 2iyemhe 'though; even if'
clause type to allow strong claims about the exact meanings that could be
conveyed, there is little doubt that Barbareho Chumash speakers were able
to make subtle distinctions in concessive and concessive conditional meanings
by varying the combination of these conjunctions and other morphosyntax.
Understanding how expectations and points of view are conveyed by
adverbial clause conjunctions is a difficult task, especially when the language
in question is no longer spoken and all of the data come from monologic
narratives. It would be doubtless enlightening to see how these conjunctions
were used in interactional contexts such as conversation. The analyses I have
offered give at best a glimpse of the ways that Barbareho Chumash people
once used these conjunctions to express, or to refrain from expressing, their
expectations and points of view.
351Part IIIInitial vs. Final Adverbial Clauses in Scope,Structure, and Punctuation/Prosodic Boundary352Introduction to Part OTThere are several major domains in which initial and final adverbial
clauses tend to differ. In part III of this dissertation we will explore three of
them for BarbarehoChumash:scope, morphosyntacticstructure,and thepresence or absence of a prosodic/punctuation boundary between the
adverbial clause and its main clause. All three of these domains reveal
different ways in which the semantic bond between a final clause and its main
clause is stronger, generally, than the bond between an initial clause and its
main clause.
Scope refers to the number of clauses to which the situation named by
the adverbial clause applies. In both spoken and written forms of speech,
preposed clauses are capable of having a much wider scope than postposed
clauses (Chafe 1984, Thompson1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985; Givén1990). As we will see in chapter 17, the data from Barbarenho Chumash
affirms this crosslinguistic pattern.
Initial and final clauses may differ with respect to morphosyntactic
structure. As will be shown in chapter 18, one of the major morphosyntactic
differences often seen between initial and final clauses in Barbareho Chumash
is that final clauses are explicitly marked as syntactically dependent by the
proclitic hi=, the ubiquitous marker of syntactic dependency in Barbarenho
Chumash grammar.
Finally, studies have shown that postposed adverbial clauses, with
certain exceptions, are less likely than preposed adverbial clauses to be
separated from the associated main clause by a prosodic boundary in spoken
speech, or by a punctuation mark in written speech (Chafe 1984, Quirk et al.
1985, Ramsey 1987, Givén 1990, Ford 1992, 1993). In chapter 19 we will seehow Harrington’s use of commas, periods, and even colons in his transcription
of Mary Yee’s speech falls into certain patterns with initial and final clauses.
These patterns give crosslinguistic support to claims that have been made
about prosodic and punctuation boundaries in adverbial clause constructions.
The main points and conclusions from chapters 17, 18 and 19 are
summarized and synthesized in the summary of part III.","[373, 374, 375]"

In Barbarenho, a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has
a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure. Most clauses have at most one full
NP, however (Ono 1996). The verb-initial word order occurs in independent
clauses as well as dependent clauses, such as complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses. Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and
are typically not part of the clause that follows. Usually these NPs are set off
by topic or focus particles. Finally, nominalized clauses are common in
Chumash languages. These may occur as subject or object complements,
relative clauses, part of cleft constructions, or as free NPs.
The following topics are treated in 2.3: basic clause structure (2.3.1),
two-verb predicates (2.3.2), the morphosyntax of nominalized clauses (2.3.3),
pragmatically-marked constructions (2.3.4), complement-taking predicates and
their complement clauses (2.3.5), relative clauses (2.3.6), and appositive
clauses (2.3.7). The chapter ends with examples of coordination in 2.3.8.
2.3.1Basic clause structureThe Barbareno clause is typically verb-initial, though the verb may be
preceded by modifiers, conjunctions and cliticized connectives. The clause may
or may not have full NP arguments and oblique adjuncts. If there is more than
one full NP within the clause, then the following orders normally prevail:
objects precede subjects, objects that are not semantic patients precede
objects (ones that are semantic patients) and subjects. All core arguments
precede non-core NPs. Syntactically-dependent constituents within the clause
are typically marked with the proclitic hi=. Following are examples of various
constituent orders.

"Linkage such as this tends to occur between successive paragraphs in a
discourse, and has been called tail-head linkage (Longacre 1968, Thompson
and Longacre 1985). An event mentioned in the last sentence (the 'tail') of
a paragraph is picked up and mentioned again in the first sentence (the
""head') of the next paragraph. Initial temporal clauses are often the means
by which the linkage occurs. Back-reference occurs primarily through lexical
overlap. It often involves repetition or a paraphrase of the event denoted by
the verb in the preceding sentence, as in (1) above with the event ‘eat
breakfast '. Such recapitulative lexical overlap provides cohesion with previous
material in the text (Thompson and Longacre 1985, Thompson 1987:449).
Several examples of linkage through overt back-reference in BarbarenoChumash are presented below. The example in (2) gives the first 13 lines of
a procedural text. In this text, Yee tells how her ancestors made tobacco
amulets. The tail-head linkage process starts with the postposed temporal
clause in line c. (the tail), ‘until it got thick like pitch', and proceeds with the
preposed temporal clause in line d. (the head), 'And when it got thick"". In
this linkage one sees a repetition of two key lexical items: the particle moke
‘already' and the verb with its subject prefix, s-polon ‘it is thick’.",[481]
"<Then, it is still hot, and they quickly plop it into the mouth of that dog, and they
hold its mouth shut, for about half a minute.> Now, they said, eat eggs! '8.5 Differences among na clauses, mali‘when' clauses and haku‘if’clauses with respect to level of expectation and likelihoodAs has been pointed out by Thompson & Longacre (1985:193), Givén
(1990:830, 832-833), and Comrie (1986), many languages code distinctions in
conditional and time clauses, distinctions that have to do with the speaker’s
level of expectation about the possibility or hypotheticality of the event in
question. For example, Thompson and Longacre (1985:193) state that the
difference between the English sentences 'If he comes, you will see him' and
205""When he comes, you will see him' is that the latter, 'when he comes"",
codes a higher level of likelihood or expectation that the event 'he comes'
will occur. Thus with the English conjunction 'when', the speaker has a
Fe
hia
ees
higher expectation that he will come; with ‘if’, the speaker
has
a lowei
expectation that he will come.
Like English and many other languages, Barbareno Chumash codes the
speaker’s level of expectation via the choice of an adverbial conjunction. This
is particularly clear for three of the adverbial conjunctions: mali 'when', na
‘if; when' and haku ‘if; whether'. The schematic in Figure 3 shows where
these conjunctions stand, relative to each other, on a scale of expectation,
likelihood, and hypotheticality.haku‘if!na‘if; when'mali<‘when!
>LowerhigherFigure 3. Level of expectation or likelihood that a given event will occur
By choosing one of the three adverbial conjunctions over the other, Barbareno
speakers could indicate how likely or unlikely they felt a given event orsituation to be. Generally, when the haku 'if' conjunction is used, the event
or situation named in the adverbial clause is the least likely to occur but not
altogether impossible. When the na ‘if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is indeed possible but not necessarily expected to occur. Finally,
when the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the event or situation is not only
likely to occur, but it may also be expected to occur.
My analyzed Barbareho Chumash corpus does not contain any data
sets that minimally contrast all three conjunctions. However, the following text
excerpts illustrate the foregoing generalizations. We will start with situations
typically coded with a haku '‘if' conjunction.
haku 'if' clauses typically name situations or events that the speaker
feels are least likely to occur in the daily course of life. This generalization
applies to conditional haku '‘ift clauses as well as to semantically neutral
haku clauses. (The generalization does not, however, apply to those
206grammaticized haku constructions that have meanings such as ‘it does not
matter whether...'.) For example, in the textlet in (26), the topic is about a
particular kind of comet and the omen it portends. The conditional haku ""if!
weesserew
clause codes thetw eae
highly unlikely,
hypothetical situation of seeing a rare kind of
comet--one that is red in color.","[227, 228, 229]"
"DP=ART=NM-PL-HAB<what they used to drink was strong.>-agmil-EP.?-drink59.0557In line b. above, there is glottalization prefixed to the plural affix ~iy-. Such
glottalization is the kind of nominalizing glottalization discussed in 2.2.2.5. In
nominalized verbs, a glottal stop is prefixed to an otherwise vowel-initial stem
(as noted by Beeler and Whistler 1980:93). What counts as a stem, in cases
such as this one, is that part of the word that follows the article. Since the
plural prefix -iy- is vowel initial, and since it directly follows the article,
glottalization is therefore prefixed onto the stem. A further illustration of this
pattern is seen when a nominalized verb has the indefinite prefix -am-. In
(267) there is a minimal pair of nominalized clauses based on the verb kutiy
‘to see’. One of the nominalized forms has the indefinite prefix -am-, along
with the additional glottal prefix. The other nominalized form does not contain
~am-, and since it is therefore not a vowel-initial stem it does not have theextra glottal prefix.

the article 1= in the nominalized verb. There is one type of context in which
this replacement does not occur, and the nominalized clause retains full
subject marking on its verb. If there is a modifier or some kind of particle
preceding the verb, then the article will be attached to that element instead
of the verb. The verb is then inflected for person the same as it would be in
an independent clause. For example, the verbs in (268) and (269) are both
preceded by the particle howo 'still, yet'. In (268) the third person subject
is singular; in (269) the third person subject is plural. In both instances the
verbs retain the third person pronoun s-, while the article 1= is attached to
the particle howo ‘still, yet"".","[99, 100]"

Barbareho Chumash has at least three structurally-distinct cleft
constructions. Payne (1997:278) defines a prototypical cleft construction as
follows:
QJEEUSTYe'... a type of predicate nominal consisting of a noun phrase (NP;)
and a relative clause whose relativized NP is coreferential with
NP;,. NP; is commonly referred to as the ""clefted constituent,""
and is normally found to the left of the rest of the clause,
though it may appear in other positions. '!
Though all three cleft constructions consist of an NP followed by a
nominalized clause, in only one of the cleft constructions does the nominalized
clause have the same form as typical, nominalized relative clauses in
Barbareno. I refer to these three kinds of clefts in the following way: i) true
clefts; ii) pseudo clefts; and iii) hi clefts. True clefts and pseudo clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the stative clitic ka=; hi clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the focus clitic hi= (not to be confused
with the dependent clitic hi=). These cleft constructions are illustrated in turn.
e True clefts
In true cleft constructions, the clefted NP either has the stative prefix2al-, as seen in (282) and (283) below, or it has the predicating particle
?akay (glossed 'cLeFrr'), as seen in (284). In both cases the clefted NP is
followed by a nominalized clause that has the stative proclitic ka=.

e Pseudo cleftsStructurally, there is one difference between true clefts and pseudo
clefts. In pseudo clefts, the clefted NP is ""bare"" in the sense that it does not
have the stative prefix 2a1-, nor is it preceded by the predicating particle
?akay. Also, pseudo clefts are much more frequent in the corpus than trueclefts. Two illustrations of a pseudo cleft are given in (285) and (286). (For

Adverbial Clauses in BarbarehoChumash Narrative DiscourseBy
Suzanne WashThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionallyoriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clausescodetemporal,conditional,concessive,purposive,reason/causal,manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similaritiesanddifferencesinstructure,extentofscope,andpunctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study withthe closing remarks in Part V.,

Introduction1.1 Purpose of this studyThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.
1.2 Geographic and linguistic affiliation of the Barbareno Chumash language
Barbareno belongs to the Chumashan family of languages. The original
territory of the Chumash people extends along the California coast from a
little beyond San Luis Obispo in the north down to Malibu in the south. It
extends inland, bordering the San Joaquin valley. It also includes the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands, three of which were inhabited year around: Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel. The Barbareho language itself was spoken
in the present-day Santa Barbara county, roughly in an area from Refugio
Beach to Carpinteria. The last known speaker of Barbareho was Mary Yee,
who died in 1965.
The word Chumash originates from ehumas ‘islander', a term used
by mainlanders. However, if the word &uma is derived from the same root
as the Barbareno word 2anéum ‘money; shell bead money', as I believe
2it is,’ then the original meaning of the word éhumas has more to do with the
fact that the islanders were the producers of money. The ancestors of the
present-day Chumash had a market economy long before the Europeans
arrived, They used precisely-measured strings of shell-bead money as their
currency. The islanders produced this currency for export and trade to the
mainland. The islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel were mints
in the literal sense of the word. See King 1976, Hudson & Blackburn 1986 and
Arnold 1987 for detailed information on this subject.
Chumashan has two major branches with at least six languages. Earlier
classifications were later refined in Klar 1973, 1977, 1981, and Mithun 1999,Known dialectal divisions are given in parentheses.

Venturenho: (Mugu, Malibu, Shisholop, Matilija, Ojai-Santa PaulaSespe- Castac)
Island Chumash [also referred to as Ysleno]: (Cruzeho, Roseho, Migueleho)
Most of the names for the Chumash languages are derived from the
names of the mission communities in which their speakers lived: Obispeno,
fromMissionSanLuisObispo;Purisimeno,fromMissionLaPurisimaConcepcién; Ineseho or Ynesefio, from Mission Santa Ynez; Barbareho, from
Mission Santa Barbara; and Ventureho, from Mission San Buenaventura. The
name of the sixth member of Chumashan, IslandChumash, comes from thefact that its three dialects were spoken by people who lived on the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands: Cruzenho, from Santa Cruz Island; Roseho, from
Santa Rosa Island; and Migueleno, from San Miguel Island.
Much remains to be understood about the dialectal divisions within
each Chumash language. Until all of Harrington’s notes are thoroughly
analyzed, definite conclusions about the dialectal differences within each of the
Chumash languages will have to wait.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"21.1.2 Establishing contrastsA second discourse function that conditional clauses are known to have
is that of establishing contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse
(Thompson and Longacre 1985:222-223, Ford and Thompson 1986, Ford
1993). This function is another way that an initial conditional clause provides
a framework of shared information, through which the reader/listener
interprets the information in the immediately following discourse.
This function of establishing contrasts could be subcategorized under
the broader function of exploring options and alternatives (Ford 1993:56-59).
Contrasts often involve pairs of initial adverbial clauses, the first one
introducing one option, the second one establishing a contrast or opposing
option to the first option (Ford 1993; see also Longacre 1976:105-106 on the
relation between two-pronged contrasts and 'but' structures). In addition, as
we will see, in the Barbareho data there is significant lexical overlap both in
conditionals that introduce options and in conditionals that introduce
contrasts. However, in the Barbareno data, negation is always directly involved
in creating the contrasts that initial conditional clauses help to establish, but
negation may or may not play a direct role in helping initial conditional
clauses create options and alternatives. For this reason I treat these two
functions as being separate, though they are related. The important ingredient
of negation is echoed in the schematic formula in (7), which Ford and
Thompson (1986:357) give for this discourse function (though Ford and
Thompson do not suggest that contrasting conditionals must have a morpheme
that signals negation).",[454]
"An extensive taxonomy of adverbial clauses from a cross-linguistic
perspective is given in Thompson and Longacre 1985. Adverbial clause
constructions are defined as 'a set of two-clause constructions in which oneclause can be said to modify the other in a way similar to the way in which anadverb modifies a proposition' (p. 171). This article has two parts. Part I
discusses in detail the types of adverbial clauses found around the world.
These are labeled according to the kinds of semantic relationships that they
signal,
specifically:
circumstantial/means,time,
location,
manner,
purpose,
reason,
simultaneous, conditional, concessive, substitutive,additive, and absolutive. Thompson has since discarded the absolutive
category.’ With each semantic category of adverbial clause, Thompson and
Longacre describe and explain certain structural or morphosyntactic
regularities that one usually finds associated with them. Part I of the study also
highlights similarities between the types of adverbial clauses and other kinds
of syntactic structures, for example juxtaposed clauses, that can convey similar
meanings.
There is also some discussion of borrowed subordinators;
specifically, the factors that lead to one language borrowing an adverbial
clause conjunction from another language. Part II of the Thompson and
Longacre study examines adverbial clauses from a discourse perspective in
monologic texts. It focuses on the ways in which adverbial clauses are relevant
to the structure of paragraphs and of the discourse as a whole. The issues and
questions addressed in Thompson and Longacre 1985, regarding both specific
types of adverbial clauses as well as specific functions, are a useful heuristic
for anyone planning a case study on adverbial clauses.
Chafe 1984 explores how intonation contours and punctuation units
reflect the extent to which an adverbial clause is bound to its main clause, inEnglish written and conversational discourse. If both an adverbial clause and
its main clause occur in the same intonation or punctuation unit, the adverbial
clause is said to be 'bound'. Otherwise, it is said to be 'free'. This study7compares four types of adverbial clauses: preposed clauses that are free,
preposed clauses that are bound; postposed clauses that are free, and
postposed clauses that are bound. A major finding was that adverbial clauses
that are bound are almost always postposed. Chafe explains this tendency
through the theory of Information Flow. The intonation/punctuation unit is the
domain of information flow, with information flowing from the old or familiar
to the new or unfamiliar. When two clauses fall under a single contour, it is
likely that only one of the clauses will convey new or unfamiliar information.
Chafe found that the postposed adverbial clauses contained the new or
unfamiliar information. A second important finding is that free adverbial
clauses are much more common than bound adverbial clauses. Free adverbial
clauses tend to occur initially, however, because they function as 'guideposts'
to information flow, 'signaling a path or orientation in terms of which the
following information is to be understood ' (p. 444). This, according to Chafe,
is probably the prototypical function of adverbial clauses. For the free
adverbial clauses that occur postposed, Chafe found other explanations. Some
were afterthoughts. Other free, postposed adverbial clauses functioned to
modify only the latter part of the preceding main clause, rather than modifying
the entire main clause. This suggests, according to Chafe, that '...the modified
portion of the main clause [is] not even clearly articulated in the speaker’s
mind until the main clause was completed' (p. 447). The findings in Chafe’s
study are incorporated into the issues and questions I address in parts three
and four of this dissertation.
Ford 1993 is an entire monograph devoted to the discourse functions
of adverbial clauses in American English conversation, using the sociological
framework of conversation analysis. Focusing on prosody and interaction
within a conversational context, the author examines the distribution and
discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal (reason) adverbial
clauses. There are two main conclusions. The first is that preposed adverbial
clauses play a significant, global role in the structuring of a discourse. The
second is that postposed adverbial clauses have a local role of modifying the
proposition of the preceding main clause, without affecting the overall
organization of the discourse. These conclusions are echoed throughout all of
the literature on adverbial clauses reviewed here, including those studies using
monologic data. Ford’s other findings are that conditional clauses are most
often initial, while temporal and causal (reason) clauses are most often final.
The reasons for these distributions are discussed in terms of factors that are
specific to talk-in-interaction, e.g. the system of turn-taking, problems in
understanding and agreement between speaker and hearer, the need to soften
8assertions, personal motivations, listener prompts, etc. None of these factors
are directly applicable to the data in my Barbareno corpus. However,
throughout the book Ford makes specific predictions or generalizations about
the functions of initial and final temporal, conditional, and causal clauses.
These predictions provide another perspective that has proven useful to my
analyses of the Barbareno data in parts three and four of the dissertation.
Haiman 1978 is a crosslinguistic study of the connection between
conditional clauses and topics. The author finds that, very often among
unrelated languages, conditional clauses and topics resemble each other in
marking and in function. Haiman notes that this similarity is at first surprising,
since topics and conditional clauses are structures that one would not normallythink to be related. Haiman’s discussion follows the premise that similarity in
structure must reflect a similarity in meaning since '...grammars tend to miss
semantic generalizations, rather than to create spurious ones' (p. 565). He
compares traditional definitions of conditional clauses in the philosophical
literature with definitions of 'topic' found in linguistics literature, and finds
that the definitions are similar. Topics and conditional clauses are found to be
unchallengeable and thereby ‘constitute the framework which has been
selected for the following discourse’ (pp. 583,585). In other words, both are
pragmatically presupposed (Givén 1990:830). The main conclusions from this
study are that conditional clauses and topics belong to the same category, and
that conditional clauses are the topics, i.e. givens or presuppositions, of the
sentences in which they occur. As Givén (1990:846) notes, this comparison of
adverbial clauses and topics can only go so far. Prototypical nominal topics
tend to be highly recurrent and important, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric,
whereas adverbial clauses are rarely recurrent. Still, Haiman’s observations are
relevant to Barbareho data in that many initial adverbial clauses precede the
topic marker 21. This is especially true of those adverbial clauses that express
a conditional relation. The foregoing is the extent of the insight that Haiman
1978 provides for the purposes of my study, however, since his data consist of
sentences constructed in isolation.
Ford and Thompson 1986 is a study of the discourse function of
conditionals in both spoken and written texts. One of the central aims of that
study is to test Haiman’s (1978) proposal that conditionals have the same
function as topics. The authors found that there are several functions that
conditional clauses may have in discourse contexts. Most of these are
associated with conditionals that occur in initial position. Like topics, initial
conditionals serve as a framework of shared information for the following
discourse. First, initial conditionals may be used to repeat claims voiced earlier
9in the discourse. A different, second function is that they may establish
contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse. Or, third, they can be
used to introduce particular cases exemplifying preceding generalizations.
Finally, initial conditionals may also function to offer other options or points
of view that are relevant to those of the preceding discourse. Final
conditionals, unlike initial conditionals, seem to be motivated by factors that
have little to do with the need for a shared frame of reference. For example,
the length of the conditional clause can affect whether it is initial or final;
lengthy ones tend to be final. If the conditional clause is embedded within
another clause then it tends to be postposed, and its scope is limited to the
embedded clause. Also, important or lengthy subjects in the consequent clause
tend to be initial rather than final, which means that the conditional clause hasto be final. Ford and Thompson also found that final conditionals tend to
follow main clauses that express an evaluation or question, though they cannot
explain why this should be so. Final conditional clauses do not play as
important a role in organizing the frame of a discourse as initial conditionals
do; they are not pivotal points in the development of a discourse. One notable
function of final conditionals, however, is that they often function to introduce
afterthoughts or serve as reminders. In conversational texts, conditionals are
used to make polite requests, or otherwise make a given point of view appear
less dogmatic or intrusive. The texts in my Barbareno database are not
conversational texts. Nonetheless, the Ford and Thompson study provides
many insights that have been incorporated into chapter 21 of this dissertation.
Thompson 1985 is a seminal study of the discourse properties of
purpose clauses in written English texts. The author focuses on the different
discourse functions of initial and final purpose clauses. Her main findings are
that initial and final purpose clauses have radically different roles with respect
to the organization of the discourse, even though both types of clauses have
a similar structure:
'...the initial purpose clause functions to state a ""problem"" within
the context of expectations raised by the preceding discourse, to which
the following material (often many clauses) provides a solution, while
the final purpose clause plays the much more local role of stating the
purpose for which the action named in the immediately precedingclause is performed' (p. 55).
Another major finding in Thompson’s study is that the number of initial
purpose clauses is much lower than the number of final purpose clauses.
10Thompson’s insights have been incorporated into my analysis of initial and
final purpose clauses in chapter 20.
Finally, two additional, important sources that inform my analysis are
Haiman and Thompson 1984 and Matthiessen and Thompson 1988. The
former study makes the point that the term ‘subordination' or ‘subordinate
clause' is too broad to be useful in characterizing an adverbial clause, a
complementclause, a relative clause, etc. The latter study, Matthiesen andThompson 1988, is done in a Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework.
My dissertation is not written in an RST framework. However, the
Matthiessen and Thompson study is valuable because one of its central aims
is to define and exemplify, explicitly, how adverbial clause combining is
different from other types of clause combining and subordination. For
example, the authors discuss the difference between 'embedding' and ‘clause
combining '. They argue that complement clauses and relative clauses, which
are types of clause embedding, are completely different in kind from adverbial
clauses, which illustrate clause combining. They further discuss the difference
between two types of clause combining: parataxis and hypotaxis. Roughly
speaking, parataxis involves the combining of clauses that are on the same
syntactic level, such as seen in prototypical coordination. Hypotaxis involves
the combining of clauses that are not on the same syntactic level, i.e., one
clause is syntactically dependent on one or more 'main' clauses. Hypotaxis
can be thought of as a more explicit kind of subordination. That is, though a
hypotactic clause is syntactically dependent on a main clause, it is not a clause
that is also a dependent constituent within that main clause, as a subject
complement, object complement, or a relative clause would be. More about
hypotaxis in relation to the definition of the term ‘adverbial clause' is given
in section 1.7.
1.7 TerminologyIn this section I define or characterize terms and concepts that are
especially relevant to my analysis of adverbial clauses in Barbareho Chumash.
I begin with the concept of ADVERBIAL CLAUsE. Following that I give definitions
for terms traditionally used to denote the semantic relation of an adverbial
clause to its main clause(s): TEMPORAL, CONDITIONAL, CONCESSIVE, REASON,
PURPOSIVE, and MANNER. Another kind of semantic relation distinguised in this
dissertation is the semantically NEUTRAL relation. These semantic relations are
defined in a general way in this section, but they will be further defined and
discussed in terms of criteria specific to the Barbareno language in section
1.9.2.
11My general characterization of a prototypical adverbial clause is as
follows. First, an adverbial clause exists in a hypotactically dependent
relationship with one or more clauses. A HyPOTACTIC CLAUSE is one that is
dependent on a main clause but which is not embedded in the main clause.
As noted in Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, hypotactic dependence is an
important feature that distinguishes adverbial clauses from other kinds of
subordinate clauses, such as object- or subject complements and restrictive
relative clauses, which are embedded in their main clause. Thus a complement
clause is either a subject or object argument of a main clause verb, but an
adverbial clause is never an argument. A restrictive relative clause is a
constituent that makes up part of a larger noun phrase, but an adverbial
clause never serves as a constituent of a noun phrase.
Second, unlike other kinds of hypotactically dependent clauses, such as
non-restrictive relative clauses and clauses of reported speech (the latter is not
to be confused with clauses of quoted speech), an adverbial clause can
normally appear before or after the main clause without a change in meaning.
Finally, as traditionally defined for two-clause constructions, an adverbial
clause is one that modifies another clause or sentence. As seen in the
literature review section, however, sentential modification does not begin todescribe the kinds of functions an adverbial clause may have.
A PREPOSED or initial adverbial clause is one that occurs before its main
clause. A postroseEp or final adverbial clause is one that follows its main clause.
Following now are general definitions and characterizations I use for
the traditional terms that denote the semantic relation between an adverbial
clause and its main clause. These definitions and characterizations are
extrapolated from discussions in Thompson and Longacre 1985, Matthiessen
and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990 and Ford 1993. A Tempora_ relation is one
in which the event named by the main clause is anchored to the time of the
event named by the adverbial clause. In a conpiTIonaL relation, the adverbial
clause provides the condition(s) under which the event named by the main
clause holds. Sometimes the semantic relation is conflated with respect to
conditionality and time. I refer to such relations and the adverbial clauses that
code them as NEUTRAL. In a concsssive relation, the adverbial clause expresses
a situation that, from the narrator’s or protagonist’s point of view, would
‘under normal circumstances detract from or mitigate the situation expressed
in the main clause. Or, as Thompson and Longacre (1985:198) state, it ""makes
a concession against which the proposition in the main clause is contrasted.""
In a purpose relation, the adverbial clause provides a purpose for which the
event in the main clause is undertaken. Importantly however, as noted in
12Thompson and Longacre 1985:185, the situation expressed in the adverbial
clause must be unrealized at the time of the event expressed in the main
clause. This restriction is a crucial difference between purpose and REASON
relations. In the latter, the situation in the adverbial clause is the reason forthe situation that obtains in the main clause, and it may already be realized
by the time the situation expressed by the main clause has occurred. Finally,
in a MANNER relation, the adverbial clause specifies the manner in which the
action or event of the main clause occurs.
The foregoing are non-language-specific definitions for the semantic
categories of adverbial clauses analyzed in this dissertation. In section 1.9.2 I
discuss the methodology I use to determine which Barbareho adverbial clauses
have which of the semantic relations discussed above.
1.8 DatabaseAlmost all of the data that I have used for this dissertation come from
microfilm reel #59 of the Harrington corpus, which is outlined in Mills and
Brickfield 1986. This reel consists mostly of 243 narrative texts from Mary
Yee. I have provided an interlinear, morpheme-by-morpheme gloss for all of
these texts, which vary in length from about half of a printed page to fifteen
printed pages including the free translation. Of the 243 texts in reel #59, 205
were found to contain adverbial clauses. Examples of narratives from reel #59
include procedural or ‘how to' texts, personal family experiences,
ethnographic accounts, and tales about legendary sorcerers and other
magically powerful people. It should be noted that there are several more
microfilm reels of data from Mary Yee, and that my data are taken from
roughly 25% of the total corpus of texts and notes that Harrington recorded
from Yee.
Of the data from Beeler’s corpus, I used one of the myth texts he
recorded from Mary Yee (Beeler and Whistler 1980). This published text is
four pages long, with detailed commentary given in footnotes. This text was
found to have adverbial clauses, bringing to a total of 206 the number of
narrative texts in my analyzed corpus in which I was able to find adverbial
clauses.
The total number of adverbial clauses in the corpus is 567. In the
summary to part two I summarize the distributions of these clauses with
regard to structural type, semantic relation, and position.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"
"Inadditiontothesethreeconjunctions,thereisa fourthconjunction, wa ‘if; when', that explicitly codes the fact that the speaker is
not taking a stance regarding any expectation or probability that an event can
occur or will occur. Thus in terms of the variety of adverbial conjunctions that
can code a speaker’s stance with regard to hypotheticality and probability,
Barbareho Chumash is more explicit than English.
It is not surprising that languages may differ in the number of adverbial
conjunctions they use to code semantic relations, and in the finer or broader
distinctions they may make within such relations. These differences arise from
circumstances that are unique to each language in its history of use by a
community of speakers. On the other hand, as discussed in part IV, languages
show striking similarities in the ways that initial adverbial clauses build a
discourse, creating coherence among units of a text. The reason for these
similarities is that the coherence in the text reflects the coherence in the
cognitive processes that produce and comprehend the text, processes that all
humans share (see Givdn 1995 chapter 8, and the references to the
psychological literature he cites therein). I would therefore predict that further
case studies on adverbial clauses in other languages will prove to follow in this
pattern: that differences with other languages will be found in the more
localized, language-specific details of how the semantic relations are coded,
and similarities will be found in the more global, universal areas of the kinds
of tasks that initial and final adverbial clauses perform in the constructing of
a discourse.",[581]

and ease of processing.
First, the information expressed by the clause in line a. is immediately
relevant to the main clause in line b., because the clause in line b. predicates
something about it. The information expressed in line a. is only indirectly
relevant, however, to the information expressed by the final neutral adverbial
clauses in lines c. and d. The latter two clauses do not predicate anything
about the event of drinking sea water as such, they only express further
information about its medicinal uses. We would thus not expect to see the
conjoined adverbial clauses intervening between the clauses in lines a. and b.
The second reason we would not expect to see a reversal of order has
to do with length. The two neutral adverbial clauses are conjoined into one,
lengthy syntactic unit: ‘iffwhen their bones broke and iffwhen they had
wounds '. At least one study on final adverbial clauses has shown that lengthy
conditional clauses tend to be final (Ford and Thompson 1986). The authors
suggest it may be more difficult to process lengthy, preposed, dependent
clauses that are much longer than their associated main clauses, though more
research is needed to determine the validity of such a hypothesis. This finding
might be especially applicable to spontaneous speech and spoken narratives,
particularly in VO languages.
The main clause in (25), line b., continues tracking the referent ' elder
flower tea', which is mentioned throughout the preceding discourse. The
postposed adverbial clause in line c., 'ifAvhen you have a cold', provides
circumstantial information about its main clause event, 'and then you drink
this '.

2iyeme‘although; even if' Clauses10.0 IntroductionAdverbial clauses with the conjunction 2iyeme ‘though, although;
even if‘ are another adverbial clause type in my corpus. There are only 11
tokens of this type: 3 are preposed, 7 are postposed, and 1 occurs in medial
position.
The 2?iyeme conjunction appears to be derived from a particle * 2iye
(meaning uncertain) and the emphatic clitic he ‘just, merely’. The particle
* 2iye appears to be cognate with Ineseho 2iya'and; even', which is foundin the Ineseho adverbial conjunction 2iyapa ‘even if; even though'
(Applegate 1972a). Also, the 2iye- in ?iyemhe is doubtless the same
morpheme as the 2?iye- in the Barbareho conjunction 2iyena '(even) if',
discussed briefly in chapter 8. Adverbial clauses with 2 iyeme code concessive
relations and concessive conditional relations. These relations are discussed in
turn in sections 10.1 and 10.2. One of the ?iyeme clause tokens is
discontinuous--a situation whereby the adverbial conjunction is separated from
the rest of its clause by an intervening noun phrase or another adverbial
clause. This one token is discussed in 10.3. A summary is given in 10.4.
10.1 2iyeweclauses that code concessive relationsAll of the2iyemeadverbialclauseshavebeenfoundto codeaconcessive relation with a main clause, though a subset of these also code a
concessive conditional relation. As Givdén states (1990:835), a concessive
relation involves
'...a presupposed contrast or counter-expectancy, with the ADV-clause
supplying the grounds for the counter-expectation, and the main clause
supplying the less-likely event or state'.
For example, in the English sentence ' although he liked her, he stayed away '
(from Givén 1990:835), the concessive clause ' although he liked her' provides
the grounds for the counter-expectation supplied in the main clause 'he
stayed away'. In Barbareho Chumash, only the 2? iyeme adverbial clause type
has been found to code concessive relations.
232A preposed 2iyeme clause is given in (1) line c., its corresponding
main clause is in line d. The concessive clause 'though you holler at them'
provides the grounds for the counter-expectation in the main clause 'they

for the proposition expressed in the main clause 's/he has a talent' (line a.).

<no matter how ugly he is / however ugly he is.>233Thompson and Longacre (1985:198-199) state that there are two kinds
of concessive adverbial clauses: definite and indefinite. Definite concessive
clauses have a concessive conjunction like English ""although ' or Barbareno
Chumash ?iyeme. The indefinite concessive clauses typically contain an
indefinite pronoun or question word, such as 'whoever', 'what', or 'how',
as in 'No matter what he said, she still refused to go out with him' or
""Whoever he is, ’m not opening the door’ (1985:199). The example in (2)
above illustrates both the qualities of definite and indefinite concessive
clauses: it has the conjunction ?iyeme, and at the same time it has the
indefinite question word 2akay ‘how much'. None of the Barbareho
Chumash concessive clauses were found to have indefinite elements without
the conjunction 2iyeme.
10.2 2iyeme clauses that code concessive conditional relationsSeveral tokens of the 2? iyeme clause type code a concessive conditional
relation. Concessive conditional clauses are often referred to as ‘even if'clauses (Thompsonand Longacre1985, Givén 1990), as in the Englishsentence ‘Even if it rains we'll have our picnic' (from Thompson and
Longacre 1985:196). Crosslinguistically, these clauses are similar to the regular
conditional clauses in a given language, but they carry a contrary-toexpectation presupposition not normally found in the ordinary conditional
clauses for that language (Thompson and Longacre 1985). In Barbareno
Chumash, a concessive conditional clause has the conjunction 2iyewhe
‘although, though; even if"". (Cf. however example (8) in chapter 8, where the
adverbial clause has the conjunction 2iyena ‘if’, which leans toward a
concessive conditional meaning.) Also, it may be followed by the conjunction
haku 'if' or na ‘if in the same adverbial clause. The main clause may have

the hypothetical nature of the conditional relation. An example is given in (3).
The concessive conditional clause in line b. also happens to be in medial
position. It appears to be in a dependent relation with the main clause
preceding it and the main clause following it.

adverbial clause above in line b. has the conjunction 2?iyeme. Unlike the
other tokens, however, this token also has the adverbial conjunction haku
‘if'. This token satisfies the criteria of conditional relations in that: (i) the
adverbial clause states a hypothetical condition, ‘even if he is old', and (ii)
the main clauses (lines a. and c.) are marked by an irrealis operator, in this
case the future tense prefix sa?-. It is also noteworthy that the emphatic
proclitic me
and the emphatic suffix -2 accompany these concessive
conditional relations, as seen in the main clauses of (3) above. Such
morphosyntax underscores the contrary-to-expectation meaning in the
concessive conditional relation.
Concessive conditionals with ?iyeme
and na '‘if' are unlike
prototypical conditionals in the sense that the main clause does not have an
irrealis operator such as the future prefix sa?2?-. However, emphatic
connotations are seen in the relation just as in the concessive conditional
relation that has the conjunction haku 'if' in (3). For example in (4) there
is the intensive qualifier noho? ‘very, much' in the adverbial clause. There
is also a pragmatically-marked, preposed NP in the main clause of line b.","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"<Long ago, the locks and keys were big.> At the Presidio and at the Old Missionthey had the big locks and keys.’One cannot literally lock a door by simply saying ""I am going to use a key"".
Thus the initial purpose clause in line b. above does not express a literal
purpose. Rather, it functions as a link between the implicit expectation set up
in line a. and the propositions expressed in lines c. and d. In line a., we learn
that the Barbareho people used words borrowed from Spanish when talking
about locks, keys, and any activity associated with locks and keys. The
propositions in lines c. and d. give the solution, in the form of an example of
how the Barbareno people actually used Spanish when talking about locking
up. (The word yawe 'key' in line d. is a borrowing from Spanish.) As
Thompson notes, non-literal purpose clauses in English are never found in
postposed position. The same is true for Barbareno Chumash. The reason
again is that the non-literal purpose clause is functioning as a link between
implicit expectations or needs set up in the preceding discourse and the
‘solution that follows. Purpose clauses in final position do not perform this
role.
Initial purpose clauses that help establish a chain of sequential events
always have a global, discourse-organizing role. Not all initial purpose clauses
have this function, however. One function not noted in Thompson’s study, but
one which is relevant to Barbareno, is that an initial purpose clause may name
an option that contrasts with another option given in the preceding context.
Such contrasts can be local. The initial purpose clause in that case may have
a scope of only one main clause. For example, the initial purpose clause in
(9), line d., has a much more local than global role within the discourse, and411does not appear to serve as a link between a given set of expectations or
needs and a solution.a.","[433, 434]"

Carol’s input, I have a better understanding of why Yee chose the haku

section 8.5 of chapter 8, regarding the differences in the semantics of thehaku 'ift, na ‘if; when' and mali 'when' conjunctions.)186Chapter 8
na ‘if; when; in order to' Clauses8.0 Introduction
Of all the adverbial clause types in Barbareho Chumash, the adverbial
clause type that has the conjunction na ‘if; when; (in order) to' is the largest,
with 194 tokens. In Ineseho Chumash the cognate has the same form and
means 'when' (Applegate 1972a:314). The origin of the conjunction na is
uncertain, but according to Applegate (1972a:314), Harrington believed that
this conjunction has its origins in 2ana-, which signals past intention in
Ineseho. (The Barbareno cogate is kana-.) Neither Applegate (1972a) nor
I have an alternative analysis to offer.
Adverbial clauses of the na type may code various kinds of semantic
relations: conditional (61 tokens, 31.4%), temporal (55 tokens, 28.4%), or
purpose (8 tokens, 4.1%). The majority of na clause tokens, however, are
semantically neutral (70 tokens, 36.1%). This conjunction also appears as the
second member, in a complex adverbial conjunction, with the concessive
adverbial marker 2iyeme 'though; even if'. (See chapter 10.)
Adverbial clauses that have the conjunction na are found in all
narrative genres, but the distribution within these genres varies depending
upon the semantic relation coded. For example, like conditional clauses of the
other adverbial clause types, the majority of conditional na clauses are found
in narratives that concern superstitions and beliefs, but only 1 conditional na
clause occurs in a procedural text. On the other hand, of those 8 rare na
clause tokens that code a purposive relation, 5 occur in procedural texts, but
none occur in texts about beliefs and superstitions. Temporal and semantically
neutral na clauses, however, occur in all text genres.
Adverbial clauses of this conjunction type occur in all positions. The
majority are preposed (160 tokens, 82.5%). A much smaller portion are
postposed (33 tokens, 17%). Finally, one token (.5%) appears to be in medial
position, having a dependent relation with both a preceding main clause and
a following main clause.
Following the discussion of the semantics and morphosyntax of na
clauses, I address some of the differences among na adverbial clauses, mali
‘when! adverbial clauses, and haku 'if' adverbial clauses with respect to the
degree of expectation or degree of likelihood that a given event will happen.
1878.1 na clauses that code conditional relations
Conditional na clauses make up 31.4% of the total na clause tokens.
Within this group 8% (5 tokens) are postposed and 92% (56 tokens) are
preposed. In a conditional relation, the adverbial clause names a hypothetical
or unreal situation which provides the condition under which the main clause
event or state occurs. Crosslinguistically there are certain structural indicators
in a given language that point to a conditional relation (Thompson and
Longacre 1985; Givén 1990). One tends to find in the main clause certain
affixes, particles, and lexical items that underscore the irrealis nature of theconditional relation. As mentioned previously, for Barbareno Chumash these
include the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particle may 'would; should;
might', the modal verbs uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should' or
alaqway 'can, to be able', and markers that point to the speaker’s level of
certainty such as pa 'must be, must have, probably, likely', kalpas‘certainly’, or 2inu 'surely; (be) true'. In addition to these kinds of irrealis
operators identified in Givén 1990:829, Barbareno has a rare particle,
kimini, roughly translated as 'in that case; if so; then', which occurs in themain clause in lieu of any of the irrealis operators indicated above.
Unlike the main clause, which has one or several markers that
underscore the conditional relation, the na adverbial clause itself is typically
devoid of any structural markers that might point to such a relation. Also,
there is almost always a lack of tense and aspect marking in na clauses that
code a conditional relation.
In many of the na clauses analyzed here as conditional, Harrington
sometimes translated the na conjunction as 'when', other times as 'if'. As
explained in Chapter 1, my criteria for identifying a conditional clause depend
upon independently-occuring structural factors like the ones noted above.
While Harrington’s translation is helpful in understanding the meaning of a
given word or clause, it cannot be taken as the sole criterion. The factors that
are criterial in identifying a Barbareno conditional clause are illustrated in the
examples that follow.
In the brief text in (1), Mary Yee tells about two omens that concern
spasms around the eye. The adverbial clauses in lines a. and c. name a
hypothetical situation, and the corresponding main clauses underscore the
irrealis nature of the relation via the future tense prefix sa2-.","[208, 209, 210]"
"In (4) above, the hortative particle kume occurs in a clause that
expresses the possibility of an undesirable outcome. The clause serves to
express a wish or desire on the part of a narrative-internal participant. ku
adverbial clauses, on the other hand, serve to express the purpose of what a
participant does in a preceding main clause. As we have seen, the purpose is
always to avoid an undesirable outcome that is denoted in the ku adverbial
clause.

concessive meaning seems equally plausible. There are doubtless many shades
of concessive and concessive-conditional meaning that a Barbareno Chumash
speaker could have expressed by varying the possible combinations of
conjunctions and affixes in an 2iyeme clause. Indeed, a subtle array of
meanings would be expected given the differences in level of expectation
coded by the haku 'if' and na ‘if; when' adverbial conjunctions. The 11
tokens of 2iyeme clauses in my analyzed Barbareho Chumash corpus can
give only a glimpse of what choices speakers had available to them.",[259]

Thompson (1985) had a similar figure: In her corpus of conversational
English, only 6% (3 out of 53 purpose clauses) were preposed; in her written
corpus (of 1009 tokens), only 18% of the purpose clauses were preposed.
Thompson (pp. 81,82) argues that the reason for the disparity in frequency
between initial and final purpose clauses has to do with the organizing
function that initial purpose clauses have. The basic, unmarked function of a
purpose clause is local in nature; it functions to name the purpose for which
the action in the main clause is performed. The discourse-organizing role that
initial purpose clauses perform goes way beyond this basic function. Thompson
argues that, normally, in face-to-face interaction, the speaker has other means
by which to guide the addressee’s attention. These include gestures, eye
movement, intonation, and amplitude, among other things.",[436]

GrammaticalSketch of BarbarehoChumash2.0 Introduction
This chapter is a descriptive overview of Barbareho Chumash grammar.
It is intended to provide readers with basic facts about the phonology,
morphology and syntax without going into exhaustive detail. These areas of
Barbareho Chumash grammar are dealt with in 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 respectively.
2.1 Phonology
This section gives a basic description of Barbareho phonology. It starts
with the phonemic inventory of vowels and consonants in 2.1.1 and 2.1.2
respectively. Subsections 2.1.3 through 2.1.11 give brief descriptions of some
of the phonological patterns that are characteristic of this language.
2.1.1 Vowels
There are six contrastively
language, as illustrated in Table 2.distinctiveTable 2: BarbarehovowelsintheBarbarenoChumash vowelsBoth high and mid vowels tend to be low in quality, especially in closed
syllables.
The vowels in Mary Yee’s speech have a nasal quality, as heard in
Beeler’s recordings. It does not appear that this feature is generalizable to the
speech of other Barbareho speakers, however.
Vowel length is not phonemic.
302.1.2 Consonants
The contrastively distinctive consonants are given in Table 3. There are
two main series of consonants: plain and glottalized. The consonant phonemes
enclosed in () are found only in loan words or otherwise do not commoniy
occur in the native lexicon. These include all aspirated consonants.ptkqptkg(p®)(ty(KP)(q®)ssx2h(s?)

Each of the consonants [q], [4], [q’] and [x]may vary in positionfrom velar to uvular, but are still further back than [k], [kK] and [k”’].
312.1.3 Syllable structure and syllabificationThe maximal syllable in Barbareho Chumash has the shape CCVC,
though an additional, extraprosodic consonant may occur at the edge of a
word. In its most minimal form, the syllable has the shape CV. Consonants
that are either glottalized or aspirated have restricted distributions. See Wash
1995 for details. The following examples show words in syllabified form.

Harrington (33.0235) first noted that there are two main patterns of
predictable word stress in Barbareno: stress that occurs on the penultimate
syllable, and stress that occurs on the final syllabie. Penuitimate stress occurs
generally when at least one of the final two syllables lacks a coda.","[51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"
"Thompsonnotesthatsometimes,in fact,theassociated main clause does not name any action at all. Other times the nonliteral purpose clauses are speech acts, which serve to modify assertions the
speaker or writer makes rather than the actual material itself. Examples from
English include the following,
(5) 'To set our course, there was only one golden rule.' (Severin 1978:183 in
Thompson 1985:73)
(6) 'To make gravy from pan drippings, see p. 333.' (Rombauer and Becker
1962:400 in Thompson 1985:74)
(7) 'To sum up, then, English has a very definite and complex grammar with
some variation..."" (Quirk et al. 1972:113,04 and Golkova 1968:123 inThompson 1985:74)
As Thompson notes, one cannot literally make gravy drippings by looking at
a written page, as in (6), nor is it the intent of Quirk et al. in (7) to state that
English has a ‘very definite and complex grammar’ that serves the purpose
of making summations. Rather, these purpose clauses respond to the implicit
needs and expectations of the readers. The initial, non-literal purpose clause
in line b. of the Barbareho Chumash example below functions in a similar
vein.",[432]

190Chumash one finds markers of certainty such as 2inu '(be) true; surely' and
kalpas ‘certainly; of course', among others. These are illustated in (5) and
(6). Example (5) actually has two na conditional clauses. The first na clause
appears in line a. Itsmain clause (lineb.) marks the irrealis nature of the
event with the future tense prefix sa?-. The na clause in line d. has a main
clause (line e.) with two irrealis operators: the particle 2inu? 'surely' and
the future tense prefix sa2-.

Finally, tense, aspect and modal morphology was rarely found in those
adverbial clauses that code semantically neutral relations, relations in which
conditionality and temporal meanings are conflated. These 'iffvhen' clauses
most often depicted generic situations that are a part of daily life or which
used to be a part of daily life in the earlier times of the Chumash people.
Such adverbial clauses did not serve to orient the main clause events to a
particular time frame, nor did they point to the internal make-up of the main
clause event. Also, they lacked the kinds of modal morphology and other
structural indicators of irreality commonly found in those clauses that code
conditional relations.
Pronominal subject marking
Different patterns emerged in the marking of pronominal subjects in
the adverbial clauses. In almost all cases where subject marking was affected,
it was affected in the postposed clauses. However, the loss of pronominal
subject marking in the postposed clauses happened for different reasons.
In all purposive clauses coded by the Gukanu 'so that, in order to'
clause type, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. When the main clause subject had full
control over the event or situation depicted in the adverbial clause, subject
marking in the adverbial clause was suppressed. On the other hand, when the
main clause subject did not have control over the event or situation depicted
348in the adverbial clause, or, when it was rather the adverbial clause subject that
had full control, then subject marking in the purpose clause was retained.
Purpose clauses could have the subject pronoun suppressed or retained
Alase af
urha
regardless
of whether
the purpose clause subject was a semantic patient. The
critical difference was the degree of control on the part of the main clause
subject. These generalizations turned out to be true whether the purpose
clause and its main clause had same subjects or different subjects, though
same-subject Gukanu clauses were rare. The semantics of control also seemed
to be the motivating factor behind the loss of the subject pronoun in the one
mehu‘because, since, from; in order to'clause type token that coded apurpose relation. Interestingly, however, there was rarely a loss of pronominal
subject marking in Gu ‘so that, in order to' adverbial clauses, 100% of which
are purposive and postposed. There were clear instances in which the main
clause subject was an agent that had full control of the event depicted in the
adverbial clause, but even so, the presence or absenceof control was notsomething that was coded in the morphosyntax of this adverbial clause type.
With rare exception, Gu'so that, in order to' clauses were found to havesubject marking whether they were same-subject or different-subject clauses.
In all but one of the few, exceptional cases, the lack of subject marking
involved the third person singular prefix s-. The lack of that subject prefix
was argued to be related to articulatory difficulties having to do with the close
proximity of sibilants.
In other adverbial clause types, namely the 2akimpi
when! simultaneous temporal clauses, the kKayké 'because''during, while;
reason clauses,and the kaheé 'like, as if' manner clauses, the loss of the subject pronoun
happened mainly in same-subject adverbial clauses. Such loss seems to be
motivated by the fact that postposed, same-subject adverbial clauses have a
tighter semantic bond with their main clauses than do preposed adverbial
clauses or postposed adverbial clauses with a different subject. In Barbareho
Chumash, however, such loss in subject marking applies only to third person
subjects (singular, plural, or indefinite). It never applies to adverbial clause
subjects in first or second person.
In only several cases was the adverbial clause nominalized. In such
cases, the third person subject pronoun was not retained. This was true
whether the nominalized clause was a same-subject or different-subject
adverbial clause. Such is the expected pattern of nominalized clauses
generally, as we saw in chapter 2.
In several of the adverbial clause types we saw examples of
discontinuous clauses, in which there is intervening material between the
349adverbial conjunction and the rest of its clause. This intervening material may
consist of an adverbial clause from a different clause type, or it may consist
of a left-dislocated noun. Subject marking is affected in these discontinuous
clauses,

wreiiwea¥¥dsoheAasuppressed are not suppressed in discontinuous clauses. This pattern was
especially clear with the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses in chapter 12.
The discontinuous Gukanu clauses retained subject marking but the regular
(non-disrupted) Gukanu clause counterparts did not retain subject marking.
Finally, sometimes in the Kayké'because'and kaheé'like, as if!clause types, subject marking was lost in different-subject clauses. In most cases
where this pattern occurred the adverbial clause predicate had the stative
prefix 2al-. This prefix never co-occurs with the third person pronoun s-,
but it can and does occur with first and second person pronouns. This cooccurrence restriction on the third person pronoun s- and the stative prefix
2?al- remains an unexplained phenomenon in Chumashan linguistics. As
pointed out in chapter 2, it is also not always clear why a given predicate
would take the stative prefix instead of the third person pronoun on one
occasion, and then (on another occasion) take the third person pronoun
instead of the stative prefix. Transitivity of the predicate is not in all cases a
factor, since the stative prefix 2al- can and does appear in finite verbs with
transitivizing morphology, such as applicative suffixes. Further research into
the area of third person reference in Barbareno Chumash discourse should
shed light on the patterns of subject marking we have seen in the adverbial
clause constructions.
Ways in which point of view ts coded
Four adverbial clause conjunctions were found to have a significant role
in coding the narrator’s or speaker’s stance, point of view, or expectations
about when and whether a given event had occurred, could occur, or wouldoccur. Generally, when the haku ‘if' conjunction is used, the event or
situation named in the adverbial clause is believed to be very unlikely but not
altogether impossible. When the na 'if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is believed to be possible indeed, but it is not necessarily expected
to occur. When the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the connotation is that
the event or situation is not only likely to occur, but it may also be expected
to occur. The conjunction wa ‘if; when' seems to be used when the speaker
does not wish to frame a given event or situation from his or her own
perspective, expectations, or experience. One reason for the speaker’s
reluctance could be that he or she does not have enough first-hand evidence
350or personal experience to make claims concerning the matter under discussion.
The conjunction wa also appears to be used when the speaker wishes to
refrain from making any assumptions about what another person or entity can
¥
+
dc or will do,
do. In
other
words, the speaker is not asserting his or her own
personal stance when he or she uses a wa adverbial clause.
The usage of the wa ‘if; when' conjunction is similar to the usage of
the na ‘if; when' conjunction in certain respects. The na conjunction can be
used to express a neutral stance, or a neutral expectation, about what anotherperson or entity will do or is able to do. However, whereas the na conjunction
implies that the speaker is speaking from his or her own perspective (however
neutral), the use of the wa conjunction seems to imply that, whatever the
speaker is saying, it is not something he or she is framing from his or her own
perspective.
At least three of the four adverbial clause conjunctions mentioned
above (wa‘if; when', na‘if; when'and haku'if') can be combined withother adverbial clause conjunctions to convey even more subtle distinctions in
the speaker’s stance or perspective. We saw, for example, that the conjunction
wa can be combined with the adverbial clause conjunction 2akay hu ‘until’.
The result is still an adverbial clause that codes a terminal temporal boundary,
but the conjunction wa adds an additional layer of meaning. It says that the
speaker’s own perspective is not adequate for determining when the terminal,
temporal event has happened, or whether it even can happen; rather, the
perspective necessary is that of someone else, specifically that of the referent
that is coded as the subject of the adverbial clause. Also, the concessive
conjunction 2iyeme ‘though; even if' may combine with either haku 'if'
or na‘if; when’to form different kinds of concessive conditional relations.","[370, 371, 372, 373]"

and looks the other way. '23.1.6 Other preposed neutral clausesOnly 10% (8 tokens) of the initial neutral clauses do not perform any
of the kinds of discourse-organizing tasks discussed so far. Neutral clauses in
this category are of two groups: those that serve as tangential comments or as
amendations to some earlier claim, and those that are preposed for reasons
having to do with referent tracking.
Two illustrations of neutral clauses in the former group are given in
(18) and (19). The story in (18) tells about an Indian who was able to dance
on burning hot coals. The neutral clause construction in lines b. and c. gives
the tangential aside, 'ifAvhen you look at his feet, they are not burned'.
Though it is an aside, it also supports the narrator’s claim (line a.) that the
man was able to dance on the coals, since a person whose feet got burned
would not be assumed to be able to dance on hot coals (not for very long,
anyway). Following this tangential aside is another neutral clause construction,
previously discussed as example (1), which serves as an explanation for why
the man is able to dance on hot coals without getting his feet burned.","[554, 555]"
"722.3.2Two-verb predicatesIn Barbareho Chumash it is common to find two verbs juxtaposed and
forming a single predicate. In these two-verb constructions, the first verb
typically specifies the way in which the event named by the second verb
happens. It can name the number of times the event occurs, which path or
direction the event takes, how quickly or how slowly the action is done, etc.
The second verb in these structures always takes the dependent-marking
proclitic hi=. However, in English translations, the second verb appears as
the main verb.
.
In these constructions, both verbs have their own pronominal marking.
Also, either verb may have aspectual affixes. Thus, technically, both verbs
could be analyzed as belonging to separate clauses. However, the two-verb
sequence seems to be better analyzed as a single conceptual unit forming one
clause. One reason for the conceptual unity is that both verbs always have the
same subject. Several illustrations of these two-verb predicates are given
below.
In (256), the underlined verb 'be together' signals the manner in
which the human referents play. Both verbs have the same third person plural
subject.

"114Part ITypes of Adverbiai Ciauses115Introduction to Part IEBarbareno Chumash is a language with a rich variety of adverbial
clause constructions. In this part of the dissertation I discuss and illustrate the
subtleties and complexities one finds in the syntax, morphology and semantics
of this domain of Barbareho grammar.
Barbareho adverbial clauses code a variety of semantic relations with
main clauses, including temporal, conditional, concessive, purposive, reason,
and manner relations. Some adverbial clause types code only one of these
relations, whereas others code several of them. Some of the adverbial clausetypes, however, have tokens that are semantically neutral with respect to
conditionality and time.
As we explore the ways in which these adverbial clause types code
semantic relations, we will come upon interesting issues and striking
grammatical patterns. Some of these are discussed and predicted in the
typological literature on adverbial clauses, in particular Thompson and
Longacre 1985 and Givén 1990. For example, it is known that adverbial
conjunctions that are semantically unspecific, like English 'when', generally
need to be accompanied by specific tense and aspectual morphology, and/or
lexical temporal indicators, in order to code specific kinds of temporal
relations unambiguously. We see further confirmation of this generalization in
such Barbareho adverbial clause types as mali ‘when' in chapter 6, na if;
when' in chapter 8, and wa ‘if; when' in chapter 9. These adverbial clause
types code temporal relations as well as other kinds of relations.
One often finds conditional relations to be indicated and underscored
by the modal morphology of a language. We will see that this is also the case
for conditional relations coded by Barbareno adverbial clauses, specifically
haku'if' clauses in chapter 7,na‘if; when'clauses in chapter 8, and wa‘if; when' clauses in chapter 9.
Distinctive patterns of pronominal subject marking are well known and
expected in purposive relations. In English, for example, subject marking can
be suppressed in same-subject purpose clauses. In chapter 12, we will see in
the Gukanu clause type, which codes only purposive relations, that subject
marking may be suppressed in either same-subject or different-subject purpose
clauses. We will see that the semantics of agency and control is the motivating
factor that affects pronominal suppression in this adverbial clause type. In
other Barbareho adverbial clause types, however, just the fact that the
116adverbial clause has the same subject as the main clause is enough to create
a semantic bond that is tight enough to allow such pronominal suppression.
We will see this pattern in simultaneous temporal relations coded by
2akimpi ? ‘during; while' clauses in chapter 5, reason relations coded by
kayké
'because' clauses in chapter 14, and finally in manner relations
coded by kaneé
'like; as if‘ clauses in chapter 16. Pronominal subject
suppression is attested only for third person subjects--first and second person
subject pronouns are always retained in the adverbial clause.
Sometimes mentioned in the crosslinguistic literature is the fact that an
adverbial conjunction may code the speaker’s or narrator’s expectations with
regard to the likelihood that a given event will occur. For example in English,
the conjunction 'when' connotes a greater expectation or likelihood than the
conjunction ‘if'. In the grammar of Barbareho Chumash adverbial clauses,
this is an important and complex category. Several adverbial conjunctions play
a role in coding the speaker’s point of view with regard to when and whether
an event can occur, will occur, or could have already occurred: mali‘if;when' clauses (chapter 6), haku 'if' clauses (chapter 7), na ‘if; when'
clauses (chapter 8), and wa _ ‘if; when' clauses (chapter 9). See also the
2akay hu ‘until' clauses in chapter 4 and 2iyeme ‘though; although'
clauses in chapter 10.
Barbareno Chumash has two adverbial clause types that code
distinctions in reason relations. The Kayké 'because' clauses (chapter 14)
tend to provide motivations for acts performed through talk such as
commands and claims, and reasons for conclusions that are inferred. The
ihehu ""because, since, from' clauses (chapter 15) code causal relations in
whichoneeventcausesanothereventtooccur.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"
"40020.1 Initial purpose clausesAs is true for initial purpose clauses in English (Thompson 1985), initial
purpose clauses in Barbareho Chumash generally function to state a problem
or goal, one whichresults froman expectationoor assumptionexpressedirin thepreceding discourse. The solution typically involves a sequence of events that
form a procedure for achieving the goal named in the initial purpose clause.
Hence, initial purpose clauses tend to be found in procedural texts, or in
stretches of speech that describe a sequence of steps for accomplishing a given
goal.
The excerpt in (1) describes the procedure for making a kind of homemade candle, calleda candil, which the Chumash began to use soon afterthe Spanish came to their land. The context preceding the initial purpose
clause is given in line a. We learn that there was a type of tallow candle
available for purchase, but it was a kind of candle that was not economical to
use. The Chumash used a more economical, home-made alternative called thecandil. Thus in the preceding context there arises the expectation and
assumption that there was a need for the candil, and that there must have
been a way for the Chumash to make it. The initial purpose clause in line b.
expresses the problem, 'To make a candil...', and serves as a link between
the preceding context in line a. and the sequence of events in lines c. through
x., Which delineate the procedure or ‘solution’ for making this kind of light
source.","[422, 423]"

-break.apartso that you don’t make a ""bullox” of the lie.’It is interesting to consider whether a mali 'when' conjunction could
have been used instead of a wa conjunction in line f. above. The narrativeinternal participant is coded as an addressee with the second person pronoun
228p-, and the adverbial clause event has to do with an activity that is entirely
dependent upon the judgment and willingness of this second person addressee:
whether and when to lie. By using a mati ‘when' conjunction, with the high
level of expectation and likelihood that its meaning suggests, the speaker
would be insinuating that the addressee is someone who would most likely tell
a lie. The wa conjunction, on the other hand, lets the speaker talk about the
event without implying that the event is likely to happen at all. It gives no
implication, in other words, that the addressee is someone who would actually
tell a lie. While the difference between maii 'when' and wa ‘if; when' is
reasonably clear most of the time, the difference in usage between wa 'if;when' and na ‘if; when' appears to be an especially subtle one. For
instance, the clauses in lines a. and f. above are near-minimal pairs. It is not
clear to me why Yee used a na conjunction in line a. instead of a wa
conjunction.
When wa clauses are used to repeat a claim that someone else has
made, as in (14) (previously example (5)), the speaker does not own the claim
herself or make any declarations about its truth value. The speaker says in
effect, ""For the sake of argument, let’s assume that this claim is true; let’s
consider this matter from your point of view"". For example, when Florentino
Garcia makes the claim that Indians are not people, his wife (Yee’s mother)
Lucrecia reiterates his claim using a wa clause when she says, “If they aren’t
people, what are they then?"".

<while he was chopping wood.>One possible explanation for the full person marking in line c. above has to
do with the fact that, in Barbareno grammar, whenever a particle comes

a pronoun even though it would not have had the pronoun if there had not
been any intervening material. We have seen this kind of pattern not only for

relative clauses and other nominalized

(see

line c., the verb might have had the form *2al-tani-2?-ali-2?-aqsmul
instead of the attested s-tani-2?-ali-?-aqSmul.

"In Barbareno Chumash as in many other languages, lexical overlap is
an important mechanism by which these initial conditional clauses reinforce
the theme and structure of the narrative. For example, in the narrative in (3)
above, the underlined conditional clauses vary in only one element: the name
of the animal that would serve as the spirit helper. In fact, there is significant
overlap to the point that the clausal structures are the same: Gu ‘and; but'
+ na 'if' + the name of the animal + hi (focus morpheme) + p?atiswin 'your spirit helper'. The overlap enables each initial conditional
clause to link the information in its paragraph with the information given in
the earlier paragraphs of the text. The parallel structure of these clauses is not
found with all conditionals that introduce options, but there is always lexical
overlap present in conditionals that carry out this function.
A second characteristic of many of these conditionals is that they have
a pragmatically-marked clause structure. For example, the conditional clause
may have the focus clitic hi= (not the same morpheme as the dependent
clitic). The conditional clause may also be part of a pseudo-cleft construction,
using the mildly contrasting stative clitic ka=. Or more rarely, the conditional
clause might follow a left-dislocated word that is itself the focus of |
comparison. (Examples of the latter two are to follow.) The pragmaticallymarked structure points to the role such conditional clauses have in exploring
an option that is different from the option(s) mentioned previously in the
428discourse. In other words, while lexical overlap points back to familiar and
shared information, the focus morphemes and other elements of pragmatic
marking point forward to unfamiliar, new information. examples of

conditional clause, ‘if your left [arm] is what twitches', names the alternative

with the conditional clauses in the above text excerpt: 'if your right arm
twitches' and ‘and if your left [arm] is what twitches'. The lexical overlap
allows the second conditional clause to make the information that follows it
relevant to the information that precedes it. Its pseudo-cleft clause structure,
on the other hand, underscores the fact that it is exploring an option that is
different from the one stated by the first conditional clause.
In (5), Mary Yee compares the hypothetical scenario of a coyote
howling near one’s house with the more ominous scenario of an owl hooting
near one’s house. The second conditional clause participates in the type of
pragmatically-marked construction that involves a left-dislocated NP.
