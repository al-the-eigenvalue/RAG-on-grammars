"• In commands, the difference between
azhi and bazhi is that azhi is used for
commanding a single person not to
do something, and bazhi is used for
commanding multiple people. In making
statements in the third person, bazhi is
a sentence-­level negative declarative,
while azhi may be used otherwise within
the sentence.
• Omaha does not seem to use negative
questions like: “Don’t you want it?” or
“Didn’t he read it?” All questions are
apparently asked straight up, as “Do you
want it?” or “Did he read it?”",[403]
"• The particle ama can also occur without
bi. With or without bi, ama implies that
the foregoing sentence is hearsay, the

"• For a positive command, the verb thé,
“to go,” is usually replaced by the verb
moⁿthíⁿ, “to walk.” Thus we normally
say: moⁿthíⁿ a/ga!, not thá a/ga!. For the
negative of this command, “Don’t go!”,
however, we do use the basic “go” verb:
thá azhi a/ga!",[461]
"• In a command, a preceding -­e verb
ablauts to -­a before the negating particle
azhi. In this case, the ablaut -­a and the
initial a-­of azhi merge into a single
vowel in speech. Thus, Shkāda azhi ga!,
“Don’t play!”, is pronounced, and might
be written, as Shkādazhi ga!

signals what the speaker wants the
listener to do with the concept; a demand
might be a command, a statement, or
a question, but a concept without a
demand is not a complete sentence. To
signal demand, English makes some
basic postulates about a sentence:
It has a subject, to which the rest of the
sentence relates as a predicate. The
subject is a noun phrase.
It has a head verb, which links the
predicate to the subject.",[407]

"15. 10 Declaration of Existence
Using PositionalsDeclaration of Existence• To declare the existence of an entity
in English, we use the demonstrative
“there” as the subject, together with a
form of “to be” as the head verb, followed
by a noun phrase that indicates the entity
we are declaring: [There] [is] [a door],
or [There] [is] [an elk]. This is a special
usage that has nothing to do with the
basic meaning of “there.” It is employed
to insert a new record into the database
of the other person’s mind. Compare
this with the nearly identical sentences
“There is the door,” or “There is the elk,”
in which “there” is used in its usual way
to point something out. We can also use
“There is a door” or “There is an elk” in
the same way, when we are on the spot
pointing them out. But these forms, with
emphasis on the noun, notably mean
“There exists a door” or “There exists an403elk,” which we say when we are in fact
nowhere near the door or the elk.",[474]

"Stan: Ho! [Writes the word “moⁿthíⁿ.”]• When the plain form of a verb ends in -­e,
this -­e will change to -­a in a command.
• This change from -­e to -­a is called
ablaut (pronounced ahp-­lout). Ablaut
occurs before several types of particles,
including command particles.
• When a woman is giving a command
using a verb that normally ends in -­e,
there is no separate command particle.
The command is signaled by the ablautDemands and Ablautto -­a alone. The male command uses
the command particle ga as well as the
ablaut: -­a ga.","[395, 396]"
"• The negating particle for the “I” form
is always mazhi. In colloquial speech
this particle is usually pronounced
something like maṣh.",[424]
"329330Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNL• In the nineteenth century, a statement
narrating a third party’s action was made
with the sequence: [Verb] [i] [Emphatic
Particle]. For women, the emphatic
particle was he. For men, it was ha. If the
verb ended in -­e, it ablauted to -­a.
• In the twentieth century, the [i]

dropped, leaving only the verb. If the
verb was an -­e verb, however, it retained

"• For all other forms, we use bazhi where
we would originally have i in the positive
form, and azhi where we would not.
When azhi is used, it combines tightly
with the preceding verb, so that shkāx̣ a
azhi sounds like shkāx̣ azhi.",[424]
"19. 4 The Victimized kke-­ Prefix
and Evidential t H eThe Victimized Prefix kke-­511• The prefix kke-­is much like kki-­.
But where kki-­allows that the action
was intentional, kke-­implies that
it happened accidentally or against
the subject’s will, with unfortunate
consequences. In English we might say
that someone “got beat up” or “got in
a wreck” or “bumped their head” (not
intentionally) to give the sense of Omaha
kke-­. In cases like this, the point is that
the subject is the victim of the action.
Evidential tʰe• The evidential particle tʰe coming after
a verb may be an entirely different
word from the common positional tʰe.
Evidential tʰe seems to imply that the
action was completed prior to the stream
of the narrative and that it may simply
be deduced from evidence discovered
within the stream. Thus it combines the
functions of present and past perfect in
English (has done it, had done it) with an
acknowledgment of possible doubt, in
that the action claimed is reconstructed
(evidently) rather than known directly.
• Evidential tʰe comes after i or bi but
before any final particle. Thus it splits the
common sequence bi ama, showing that
these are originally two separate words.
In the nineteenth century, narrative
action statements normally ended in
[verb] i ha (for a male speaker) or [verb]512 Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNLi he (for a female speaker) when the
speaker was making the statement on
their own authority. When reporting
hearsay, the speaker used [verb] bi ama,
and [verb] bi tʰe ama for something that
had happened, or had evidently happened,
prior to the current stage of the narrative.
For an evidential statement on their own
authority, speakers ended the sentence
with [verb] i tʰe, dropping the emphatic
ha or he. In the early twentieth century
the ha and he particles were dropped
altogether, along with the preceding i.
This seems to have left the i before tʰe,
and before clause conjunctions like kki
and egóⁿ, somewhat in limbo as well.","[582, 583]"
"• To make a statement about something
we have heard about, without taking
direct responsibility for the truth of theDemands and Ablautclaim, we use the hearsay particle set bi
ama.","[405, 406]"
"• This potential particle does not cause a
preceding -­e verb to ablaut.
Prediction Acknowledging a Free Agent• To constrain the possibility, we generally
add a positional particle after the potential
particle tte. This positional particle causes
the potential particle to ablaut to tta.
• To predict what someone is going to do
in the future, we use the positional akʰa.",[404]
"Wagōⁿze: Ho. Francine, “we licked it,”

When -­di or -­tta is added, a preceding -­a-­

Demonstrative -­thu Words• For referring generally to an area, as
with English “here” and “there,” we
use a demonstrative plus the root -­thu.
Most commonly, these forms have the
postposition -­di tacked to the end: “in
this/that area.” The -­thu forms do not
seem to take the postposition -­tta.
Location Adverbs• In English there are many different
prepositions to express relationships
more subtle than “located at,”
“toward,” and “from.” In Omaha these
relationships are handled by location
nouns.",[458]
"• When writing the command particle
in lessons we use the convention of
[command] a/ga!. A student should
use the command particle for his/her
gender. The exclamation point does not
imply a raised voice or excitement. It is
used in these lessons to serve as a sign
that the preceding a or ga is a command
marker and nothing else.

12. 3 Plural Commands: i and AblautCommand to One Person• To command one person, the command
particle follows the verb. To command
more than one person, the particle i
is placed after the verb and before the
command particle.
• We will call this particle the augment i
particle, because it takes the original
thought and augments it, by adding
extra actors or actions to the base idea.
A plural command is like a command to

"Introduction and Phonology10. 1 WelcomeThe unl grammar section stands somewhere
between a college introductory language textbook and a grammatical treatise. In its first
incarnation, in the spring of 2007, it was intended to be a grammatical guide upon which skeleton Mark and Vida would build the real textbook. As work progressed, however, it soon
became the textbook for unl . Rather windy at
first, it was tightened up to comply with Mark’s
suggestion that we trim it back into simple
rubrics for easy learning. This gave us our formula of illustrative tables with explanatory
bullet points. The remainder of each lesson
was filled out with vocabulary and five exercise
sections. Part A provided ten sentences to be
translated from Omaha to English, and part B
gave ten more sentences to be translated from
English to Omaha. Parts C, D, and E were for
imaginative classroom exercises along the lines
of the “Ttígax̣ e” immersion exercises we had
been experimenting with for a number of years.
The original plan was for twelve chapters of
nine lessons each, to be covered at the rate of
one per day, with a chapter quiz every second
week. This book would be the core of the first
college year, six chapters for twelve weeks per
semester. We commenced writing for our fourth
Omaha class cohort of 2007–­8, three bright and
diligent students. Writing and teaching a lesson a day, we made good progress for the first
semester through chapter 5. In the middle of the10
following semester we set it aside and reverted
to other activities. We taught two more cohorts
after that and made a few revisions, but we never
continued beyond chapter 6. Chapters 7 through
10 have been written in the past two years to
complete the project and cover the essentials
of Omaha grammar. In fact, five chapters per
semester seems more realistic than six, and this
conforms nicely with the five credit hours per
semester that are standard for first-­year language courses at the University of Nebraska–­
Lincoln.
It should be emphasized that the unl grammatical lessons in part 2, unlike the unps section making up part 1, are not based directly on
sentences elicited from native speakers. Our
focus has been on grammatically analyzing the
language to understand its system in a way that
would allow a second language learner to speak
it in any context with a morpheme-­level understanding of what they are saying. Our approach
is therefore experimental rather than cautiously empirical. We, the students of Omaha, have
made up our Omaha sentences, to be reviewed
by our native speakers, who either pass each
sentence or help us correct it. But the sentences
are from the imaginations of outsiders and are
not necessarily reflective of what people native
to the language and culture ever actually say.
Our method has its benefits for learning to use
the language again in an open-­ended way that
allows us to say what we will, but it has its risks
of potential distortion as well. With that cave281282 Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNLat in mind, we have always striven for accuracy
and have maintained an ethic of correcting ourselves immediately whenever we find ourselves
in error. We sincerely hope that our grammatical
analysis and the supporting sentences in this
book do justice to the Omaha language and to
the people who have spoken it as their native
language.
10.2 Siouan LanguagesOmaha belongs to a large family of related languages called Siouan. Its closest relative is Ponca,
which probably split off from Omaha some three
hundred years ago, around 1700. Omaha and
Ponca are essentially the same language. They
are perhaps about as similar to each other as
British English is to American English. The Poncas lived just to the northwest of the Omahas in
northeastern Nebraska, until most of them were
removed to Oklahoma in the 1870s.
Next most closely related are Osage, fromcentral Missouri, and Kaw, or Kansa, from eastern Kansas. These two languages are more closely related to each other than to Omaha-­Ponca.
They would be only partially comprehensible
to a speaker of Omaha, perhaps as a speaker of
Scottish English would be to a speaker of American English.
A bit further away again is Quapaw, from
eastern Arkansas. These five languages—­
Quapaw, Osage, Kaw, Omaha, and Ponca—­make
up a group that we call Dhegihan (pronounced
“lay-­ghee-­han”).
Dhegihan is one of three or four groups that
make up Mississippi Valley Siouan, or mvs for
short.
The Dakotan branch of mvs is the Sioux
proper, and includes Santee (Dakota), Yankton,
Teton (Lakota), Assiniboine, and Stoney. This is a
widespread group that dominated the northern
Plains from Minnesota to Montana, and from
Fig. 26. Dhegihan family tree.","[351, 352, 353]"
"• Like the command particle, the augment
i also causes an immediately preceding
verb ending in -­e to ablaut to -­a.
Command to One Person, -­e Verb• Women sometimes seem to use the
augment even when speaking to only one
person when the verb ends in -­a, either
naturally or by ablaut. This is probably
to avoid the confusion of “losing” the
command particle when it is the same
as the ending vowel of the verb. ThisDemands and Ablauthabit may have arisen recently, in the
twentieth century, as it does not seem to
be recorded in nineteenth-­century texts.

Speaking Practice
A. Read the following command
sentences aloud. Translate each sentence
into English. Describe the gender of
the speaker making the command, and
whether the command is to one person
or several. Example:Thattóⁿ i a!: Drink it! (woman speaking
to several people)
Gāx̣ a i ga ho!: Make it!/Do it! (man
speaking formally to a group)Ígaskoⁿtha ga!: Try it! (man speaking
casually to one person)
1. Gāx̣ a i a!","[397, 398]"
"• The declarative we form of a verb that
ends in -­e usually ablauts to -­a. This may
originally have been only for cases where
more than two people were included in
“we.” At least some of our speakers at
present maintain that this ablaut always
occurs, no matter how many people are
included in “we.”
• In modern Omaha the “we” form is
often augmented by the word wôⁿgithe,
meaning “everybody,” or the word
wôⁿdoⁿ, meaning “both.”",[421]
"Ugádoⁿi-­a/ga: All hammer them in.
Our example of a verb ending in e was dóⁿbe.
You will never see e/ga at the end of a verb,
because the final e always becomes a in request/
command form.
Word Breaks and Dashes
The unps spelling system does not have hard
rules on where to put spaces and dashes. Linguistically, there are issues of both meaning and
rhythm to consider in figuring out whether a
phrase has one or more words in it. But practically we believe the intuition of speakers and171172 Lessons from Umóⁿhoⁿ Language and Culture Centerlearners in our community is good enough. Still
we try to be consistent in departmental documentation and curriculum.
There are a few cases of words that we separate when they add separate meanings to a
phrase but combine together when they have a
shared combined meaning. Names are a good
example: if we want to write the words for “big
elk,” we write óⁿpʰoⁿ toⁿga, but if we want to
write the name Big Elk, we write ÓⁿpʰoⁿToⁿga.
Similarly, “to hit stones” is íⁿ’e utʰíⁿ, but “handgame” is íⁿ’utʰiⁿ.
We use the hyphen or dash to show separate words or word parts that are “said together.” This “said together” basically means that
we do not hear speakers pausing ever between
these parts. Some words whose parts are “said
together” in this way include údoⁿ-­xti “truly good,” újoⁿ-­xchi “truly beautiful,” nákad-­
ách (full spelling nákʰade-­átashoⁿ) “very hot,”
athé-­noⁿ “s/he goes regularly,” Wikóⁿ-­akʰa “my
Grandmother,” and many more.
Sometimes we skip the dash when two parts
come together so often that we think of them
as a single part. Examples include iⁿdádoⁿshte
“something,” and the future markers like
-­tamiⁿkʰe “I will.” Even though -­ta and -­miⁿkʰe
are both endings that can come up with dashes,
when they come together we don’t put a dash
between them. There is one ending—­final
-­i—­that we never spell with a dash at all. In
our curriculum this ending will be most familiar
from plural requests like noⁿzhíⁿi-­a/ga “stand
up.” It also comes up a lot in storytelling and
formal speaking and before certain other endings like -­ki.
“Said together” usually (but not always) alsomeans that only one of the parts has a stressed
on-­beat (the heaviest, most melodic vowel
sound in the word). When this is the case, we
only spell one of the parts with an accent mark,
as in thípi-­gaxe “to do a good job.”
Not every case of two words or word parts
coming in contact works the same way. Some
speakers have different habits, and some situations make different demands. It is good to be
flexible about word divisions and dashes, paying
attention to the sound, as in the following examples that can go more than one way, depending
on where the stressed on-­beat is:
sounds like → spelling with dashes →
English translationWióⁿthoⁿmoⁿxa/ga →
Wi-­óⁿthoⁿmoⁿxa/ga → Ask me!
Wioⁿthóⁿmoⁿxa/ga →
Wí oⁿthóⁿmoⁿxa/ga → Ask me!
Oⁿguíⁿwiⁿtha → Oⁿgú-­iⁿwiⁿtha →
We told him
Oⁿguiⁿwíⁿtha → Óⁿgu iⁿwíⁿtha →
We told him
These pairs don’t seem to have any different
meanings; they just depend on how tightly the
speaker “chunked” the parts together.
There is one final group of verbs where we
regularly use dashes. Verbs like xtáthe “love”—­
or shuthéthe “send to you”—­often wind up with
a lot of additions between the main part of the
verb and the final -­the. We usually follow the
rule that if the whole word is more than three
syllables, we use a dash to break up the mainAdditional Resourcesverb part from all the additions, grouping the
additions together with the final -­the. Examples:

"• In Omaha, a noun can stand alone as

Is Language, chapter 9), drawing the accent forward if necessary. Then, in Mississippi Valley
Siouan (mvs), the vowel of the affixed pronoun
was lost, and the weak labial or alveolar consonant joined with the following simple stop

Further phonetic simplification occurred from

Cultural Note
The Umóⁿhoⁿ people come from a history and
culture where we think as a tribe and for one
another. The beliefs that “We Are One” and that
“We Are All Related” are evident in our Huthuga
clan system. Our culture has countless examples
of the care we have for one another as a people.
Today we teach our language and culture
within a classroom environment. We aim to
teach in a natural setting, through situations
that mimic community and home life. This nurturing environment promotes the growth of our
language and culture and supports the family
teachings. Unfortunately, the Boarding School
experiences and sometimes other educational institutions have left a negative effect thatmust be overcome. Praise and encouragement
is directed toward the group of students within
the classroom, though it is good to praise individually and when culturally appropriate. We
nurture our children as they go along, through
one stage of life to the next. With a nurturing
voice, we learn the value, to “talk right” to one
another. Teasing is also a part of our culture,
but we must teach people to not go “too far or
get too carried away” with it. Praise and care
are shown through our actions. The respect and
consideration shown toward one another is one
of our most important values.

verb. Thus, where ba-­dóⁿ generically
means “push,” thi-­dóⁿ generically
means “pull.” The base word doⁿ may
not specifically mean “pull” after all, but
rather any kind of forced motion toward
or away from the actor.",[514]
"175We prefer the spellings we have put in bold
here over the ones in quotes. This does not
mean other spellings are wrong; it just means
the unps spelling system tries to preserve consistent spelling even when the vowel lands on
an off-­beat and sounds different.
Variable Consonants
Two groups of consonants give English-­
dominant speakers the same “dartboard” problem as the vowels: the “weak” consonants b d j
g and the “strong” consonants p t ch k. English
speakers have a hard time hearing the difference
between these, and just like the vowels, these
consonants are not always pronounced exactly
the same way by fluent speakers. We know that
the English p t ch k sounds are represented in
Umóⁿhoⁿ Íye by pʰ tʰ chʰ kʰ. And if we are able
to get over that difficulty, we are still left with
the difference between these other sets of four.
Here are some rules and exceptions to help you:
The “weak” consonants b d j g are usually
voiced. You can hold your hand to your voicebox
and feel it vibrate when you pronounce these
sounds, especially when they are in the middle
of a word.
But at the beginning of a long phrase or sentence, many speakers do not voice these sounds.
The “strong” consonants p t ch k are usually extra long. You can feel the “tension” as you
hold your tongue or lips together for up to half a
second–­much longer than you would close them
for a “weak” consonant. This applies especially
when these sounds are in the middle of a word.
But at the beginning of a long phrase or sentence it is impossible to hear whether a sound176Lessons from Umóⁿhoⁿ Language and Culture Centerlike this is extra long, whether the speaker pronounces it that way or not.
So your hardest sounds to recognize and
write will be those at the beginning of a phrase
or sentence. Maybe you write “bahé” instead
of pahé “hill,” “bíki’oⁿ” instead of píki’oⁿ “fix
yourself,” “píze” instead of bíze “dry,” “padíⁿ”
instead of badíⁿ “to shovel.” (This last one is
especially tricky since pádiⁿ means “I shovel.”)
All these examples are problems between b and
p, because these are far and away the hardest
sounds for an English ear to distinguish, but
we can have a hard time with g and k too—­for
example, writing “gúwiⁿxe” instead of kúwiⁿxe
“go around,” “kóⁿchʰe” instead of góⁿchʰe
“after a little while / a little later / in a little bit,”
“Goⁿhó” “Grandmother” (male term of address)
instead of Koⁿhó, “gúk’si” instead of kúk’si
“pig,” or “gáxe” instead of káxe “crow.” Even d
and t can be hard, as in táshe “bud / swelling;
milkweed bud,” which is often spelled “dáshe”
or “dáshi.” Be patient with yourself and learn
tricks for asking and looking up clues when you
can’t hear the difference.
One other issue is the “softening” of the
breathy consonants pʰ tʰ chʰ kʰ and the throat-­
jump consonants p’ t’. This often happens on
the same off-­beats as the weak vowels (although
not always—­it depends on the speaker). This
“softening” just means that these consonants are
pronounced like an ordinary strong consonant
p t ch k and drop the extra ʰ or ‘. The word for
“fox” may be pronounced either tíkʰa or tíka,
the word for “dirt / earth” either moⁿthíⁿkʰa or
moⁿthíⁿka, the word for “five” either sátoⁿ or
sátʰoⁿ, the word for “necklace” either wanóⁿp’iⁿ
or wanóⁿpiⁿ, the word for “elk” either óⁿpʰoⁿ or
óⁿpoⁿ. Some words, like thipʰí, may get theiron-­beat moved when they conjugate or attach
to a neighboring word, and this can cause the
same effect: “do it right” is more likely to come
out thipi-­gáxa/ga instead of thipʰí gáxa/ga, and
“I learned it” is more likely to come out bthípi than bthípʰi. Both spellings are acceptable, and
both should be provided in dictionaries and similar
documentation where possible.
Abbreviations
Sometimes an Umóⁿhoⁿ word or phrase can
be shortened. Fluent speakers, when they are
having conversations with each other, sometimes shorten even more words. There are also
some words and phrases that are so common
that nearly everybody shortens them. At the
Umóⁿhoⁿ Language and Culture Center we often
give two spellings for words like this:
full version → shortened version →
English translationúshkoⁿ údoⁿ → úshk’udoⁿ →
good ways / kind / polite
Údoⁿ shkáxe → Úd’shkaxe →
You did good (spoken to one person)
móⁿzeska → móⁿz’ska or móⁿ’ska →
money
Dropping the First of Two Vowels
When two vowels come together, the first one is
often not pronounced. This is the most common
change you’ll notice in fluent conversations. In
the Umóⁿhoⁿ Language and Culture Center
spelling system we usually try to spell theseAdditional Resourcesphrases and words with both vowels unless the
first one was really never pronounced by any
speaker who has worked here.
When the first vowel is nasal and the second
vowel is oral, the nasality is sometimes kept
around even though the first vowel disappeared.

When two vowels come together, usually they
either share a stress or drop the first one, as earlier mentioned. But at other times they combine
into a third, different vowel—­even a vowel that
is not a typical Umóⁿhoⁿ vowel, like eⁿ!

hóⁿ-­égoⁿ-­tʰe: when it’s like nightnoⁿbéda: twin → noⁿbá ída: born as twoEven though these words are fused together
with their changed vowel, some of them can
still work like a full phrase. Noⁿbéda can work
like a verb even though the verb ída is no longer
clearly heard in it: Noⁿbéthida? “Are you twins?”
Noⁿbédawatha “She had her twins.”
Two Words Getting Their Own Stress or Not
When a word is pronounced all by itself—­
as Elder speakers sometimes do for us in178Lessons from Umóⁿhoⁿ Language and Culture Centerelicitation—­it has stress on the same place
nearly all the time. When it comes after another word and the two are closely tied together and
form a unit, it might lose that stress and just follow the stress pattern of the first word. When it
loses that stress, we spell it with no stress mark.
When it has its own stress, we spell it with a
stress mark. For example, the phrase for “dice”
can be pronounced as two independent words,
kúge zhiⁿgá “little boxes,” really emphasizing
the literal meaning of each part. Alternatively,
the second word can just follow the same beat
as the first, and then we spell it kúge zhiⁿga.
Sometimes the two words even combine into a
single word, which we spell with no space and
just one stress mark. For example, kúge zhiⁿga
can combine into kúg’zhiⁿga.matical issue, where a verb will have one ending
in some situations and another ending in the
others. The rules for this are complicated, and
sometimes even the rules have variations and
exceptions. Sometimes it’s just speaker choice,
where a meaning like “corn” might be expressed
either as wahába or wahábe. Don’t get tripped
up if you hear it one way one time and another way another time. But also don’t just give up
and assume either one is fine. If you hear it both
ways then you know both are fine. But try to
figure out the pattern when it comes to verbs.
The Umóⁿhoⁿ Language and Culture Center has
a long list of verb patterns involving final e and
a, and our list gets longer all the time.
Nasalized Soundsóⁿba itháugthe → óⁿbithaugthe → all
day / every dayWhen the sounds a e i u th are near a nasal
sound m n oⁿ iⁿ, they change and become more
nasal. This can affect the spelling. We try to keep
things closer to their basic spelling if the word
is built out of smaller parts, but there’s nothing wrong with a changed, more nasal-­looking
spelling.wéta ázhi → wét-­azhi → another egg“ basic ” spelling → “ nasal ” spelling →

no one easy rule for this. Sometimes it’s a gram-ithóⁿtha → iⁿnóⁿtha → put awayAwáhoⁿ’e → Awáhoⁿiⁿ → I prayed.thiⁿgé → niⁿgé → none / have none /
