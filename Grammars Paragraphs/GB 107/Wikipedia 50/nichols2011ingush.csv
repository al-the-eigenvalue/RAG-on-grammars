"31.1. Simple negation
The negative morpheme is either a suffix or a proclitic particle depending on the verb's
inflectional form: suffix for tense forms, proclitic cy for converbs and nonfinites, proclitic my
for imperatives. (For the negative suffixal forms see §13.12.) There is also the stylistic
option of emphatic negation, marked with a non-clitic word: see §31.6.)
In (1)-(2) the
negative morpheme is hyphenated off for visibility, though the exact morpheme boundary is
not always discrete.

The chaining particle ='a can cliticize to either the negative proclitic or (more commonly) a
preverb or reduplicate. (65)-(66) here and (59) above all deal with the same incident, where a
contractor hired to build a stone tower takes offense and leaves the tower unfinished. An

Two words meaning 'except, besides; only', maara and maarjkaa, require negation of the verb

"31.2. Indefinites in the scope of negation
There is no double or multiple negation in Ingush, with the possible exception of the two
specialized adverbs c'aqqa='a 'never; (not) … ever' and cq'ea-cq'a 'not once'. In origin these
are indefinites specialized for use in negative contexts; they contain no formal marking of
negation. Apart from these, ordinary indefinites ('someone', 'something', etc.) are used with a
negative verb, often taking focus gemination or the clitic ='a but otherwise bearing no formal696Ingush Grammarindication that they are in the scope of negation. The ordinary indefinites sag 'someone' (lit.
'person') and hama 'something' (lit. 'thing'), when in the scope of negation, have phrasal
accent if they are in the nominative case, and they can be preceded by indefinite cwa 'one' or
an emphatic indefinite (with focus gemination and optional focus particle) cwaaqqa or
cwaaqqa='a 'any'. Another form in the oblique cases is cwannie='a 'someone' (nominalized
form of 'one' plus particle). The distinctive forms are found only in the nominative; in oblique
cases, ordinary indefinite forms are used (sometimes with the focus particle).
Partial case paradigms of the most common indefinite forms:NOM

ERG'someone;
no one'
sag

cwaaqqa(='a) sag

hama
hamanna
(not attested)'nothing'
cwaaqqa hama
cwaqqa hamannaIn the following examples each of the successive primary phrasal accents is lower in pitch
than the preceding due to normal declination. After a high-accent nominative indefinite, an
element that would ordinarily bear high accent (such as bwarjga in (20), where it is the first
element of a compound) has low accent. The high tone associated with the negative suffix on
the verb sounds like primary stress with high accent and may well be so parsed. Its pitch is
lower than that of ság due to declination.

"30.6. Existential, locative, and possessive sentences
In existential, locative, or possessive clauses the domain, location, or possessor
patterns in word order like the A of a two-argument clause, and the possessed noun or the one
whose existence is asserted patterns like the O. The basic or neutral order is A patterner + O
patterner + V:

NEGATION
Negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush, regardless of its semantic scope.
(There is one exception to this statement: the negative participial forms discussed at the end
of §31.1.) The word in the scope of negation can sometimes be identified by particles and
prosody, but often there is no formal marking of scope.","[715, 716]"

negation is formally marked only on verbs.

"13.12. Negation
Indicative finite verbs are negated suffixally. For simple tenses built on the present stem,
the suffix -(â)c is added to the infinitive stem, followed by any tense suffix. For tenses built
on the past stem, -(â)ndz- is added to the infinitive stem, followed by any tense suffix.
Colloquially, and among younger speakers, the past stem is used: normative tuoxandzar
'didn't strike', colloquial tiexandzar (infinitive stem tuox-, past tiex-); normative dieshandzar
'didn't read', colloquial diishandzar (infinitive stem d.iesh-, past d.iish-); normative aalandzar
'didn't say', colloquial ealandzar (infinitive stem aal-, past eal-). In analytic tenses only the
auxiliary appears in its negative form. Plain 'be' has irregular ablaut in its negative forms, as
do most irregular verbs. The negative suffixes have high tone (§4.2), which falls on the
preceding vowel stem vowel or epenthetic schwa.

For all other verb forms, negation is proclitic. In imperatives, my= precedes the
conjugated verb form. It is interposed between that and any prefix or heavy element, but does
not trigger reduplication in simple verbs (the lack of reduplication distinguishes it from
otherwise homophonous emphatic my=). For nonfinites and converbs the negation is
proclitic cy=, positioned the same as my= and likewise not requiring reduplication.

"4. Prosody and prosodic wordhood1054.2. Tone
Ingush has a minimal tone system which is interesting precisely for being so minimal and
yet so clearly a tone system.53 The Ingush tone system has correspondents in the other two
Nakh languages Chechen and Batsbi, though the Batsbi system is one of mobile stress
apparently without separate phonemic tone. Several languages of the Daghestanian branch of
Nakh-Daghestanian have been described as having tone (Kodzasov 1990), but tones have not
been reported in the descriptions of Daghestanian languages available in English and their
presence in Daghestan is not well known outside of Russia. The Ingush system, though
minimal, is of the same general type as the Daghestanian systems, supporting Kodzasov's
analysis.
In Ingush a handful of morphemes (all of them grammatical formatives) carry a tone
realized as high or rise-fall on the tone-bearing morpheme or (if it is enclitic) on the preceding
syllable (even if that is an epenthetic schwa). See §2.9 for spectrograms. Historically, this
tone may have been non-initial stress; but now stress in Ingush is almost invariably wordinitial (and non-initial stress, in the few words that have it as described in §4.1.1, is not
phonetically identical to high tone).
The tone-bearing morphemes of Ingush are:
Proclitics
cy=
my=Negative (converb)
Negative (imperative)Suffixes
-ac
-andz-ar
-a.d, -aa.d
-alNegative (present and imperfect tenses)

consistency) present and past forms of 'be' (including tense auxiliaries). Examples ( ˆ marks
53I believe the first description of a Nakh language as having tone is Nichols 1998 (an earlier
version of this section). Komen 2007 describes tone for two Chechen clitics cognate to identically
toned Ingush ones.","[127, 128]"

Delimited 'be' is regular (Class XIV). Blanks = forms that do not exist for that verb. (Gaps in
the paradigm for neutral 'be' are compensated for by using the corresponding forms of
delimited 'be'.) Stem classification of forms is based on regular verbs, and is problematic for
neutral 'be'.

""Particle"" is as good a term as any for this formally diverse but functionally unified set of
uninflected words. All are uninflected in the sense that they do not form the standard noun
and verb inflectional paradigms, though some of them bear frozen inflection, and some of
them enter into functional paradigmatic sets with other words such that they can be
considered inflectional. None has an independent clause word order position; all are
positioned relative to the clause boundaries, the clause head (the inflected verb form), or the
word in the particle's scope. All have scope but no arguments or valence. (In their scope and
positioning they differ from interjections, which largely stand outside of clause and sentential
syntax: §5.7.) They lack lexical meaning and can be described as grammatical elements.
Here they are grouped by prosodic type.
5.6.1. Clitics. Clitic coordinating and chaining conjunctions: ='a, =ji 'and' (Chapter 24).
Both have high tone which spreads to the preceding syllable, and the vowel of the conjunction
itself is a schwa which undergoes elision (§§2.5.1, 3.2.2).
Focus and attenuative focus clitic particles: =m, =q. These are special clitics which are
positioned relative to particular words: =m follows the word in focus, and =q immediately
follows the inflected verb. It is difficult to prove that they are clitics, since they lack vowels
and therefore cannot show clitic vocalism. They are unlike affixes in that they begin with
consonants but never take an epenthetic vowel. In Ingush orthography they are written with a
hyphen, i.e. not as affixes.
Negative proclitics indicative cy= and imperative (prohibitive) my= (Chapter 31). These
have high tone which does not spread as their vowels are never elided.
The emphatic proclitic my (§§16.2.1, 32.4.2, 33.2.1), segmentally homophonous to the
prohibitive negative but without high tone.","[141, 142]"
"High tone is not an automatic property of certain morpheme classes. The witnessed past
negative carries it while the negative past participle does not:54
(31)qeikandza 'uninvited'(cf. qeikândzar 'didn't invite')The procitic negative (prohibitive) my has high tone while the segmentally homophonous
proclitic emphatic particle does not:
54The tonal difference between the two negative morphemes is interesting, as the morphemes
themselves are cognate. The Proto-Nakh morpheme was *c(V). In the witnessed past tense this *c
has been voiced after /n/, which is the only remnant in Ingush of the ancient Nakh recent past tense
suffix *-in (which survives in Batsbi and marginally in Chechen). (For voicing of *c after /n/ cf.
Chechen hinca, Ing. handz ‘now’.) This recent past suffix has high pitch in Batsbi (in my own
field notes) cognate to the high tone in the Ingush nonwitnessed and witnessed past suffixes.",[129]
"The schematic diagram of intonation in (56) shows that an indefinite modifier and the
indefinite word it modifies each have phrasal accent. The high pitch on the syllable before
='a, the high pitch on the word in the scope of negation (here, sag), and the high pitch on the
syllable before the negative -ndz- are all high, but declination lowers each successive one.

(the czar), he said. (0398B.1)13.2. Future series
Two tenses are built on the future stem: the future and the conditional. Unlike the other
forms that serve as bases for analytic tenses, the future stem has no other functions (it does
not serve as a converb, participle, or other nonfinite, and cannot be used alone as a tense
form). It is formed by adding the suffix -(a)rg to the present stem, and since this suffix is
followed by a form of 'be', all of which are consonant-initial, consonant clusters found
nowhere else in the language are formed at this morpheme boundary. These undergo unique
forms of assimilation, which are described with the tenses just below.
13.2.1. Future. Future stem plus present tense of 'be', =d.y. The -r of the future stem is not
pronounced and the -g assimilates to gender initials b and d and undergoes gemination before
the other two:

The same tone is carried by most of the same morphemes in standard Chechen (which,
however, lacks the suffixal negative). The Chechen-Ingush high tone of the mild imperative
corresponds to stress on the relevant syllable in Batsbi (Holisky 1994:181), and Proto-Nakh
non-initial stress may well be the source of Chechen-Ingush high tone. At least for Ingush
high tone cannot easily be analyzed as stress: Ingush has mostly fixed initial stress whose
side effects are prototypically those of stress and not tone, such as reduction of unstressed
vowels to schwa; some of the high-tone morphemes contain this schwa, and those that assign
the actual high pitch to a preceding syllable easily assign it to a schwa:
(40)leatta='a
land=&
'and land'{leatt\ =» '\} leattâ='a(41)jaazd»yr=ii ?
write.WP=Q
'Did (he, she) write?'[lætt»\ ÷\]Hence Ingush has both stress (mostly fixed initial) and tone (high vs. lack of tone).
Distinctive high tone appears most often on unstressed syllables. The finite verb bears a pitch
contour unique to it: a sharp rise-fall located on the tonic syllable or a high-toned suffix. The
precipitous fall to low tone on the syllable after this rise-fall is especially audible in the
witnessed past negative, where the tone-bearing syllable is followed by another in the same
word. In the following example the low tone is underlined:
(42)vealândzar'(he) didn't go' (negative, witnessed past)At a more abstract level I believe that all finite verb forms may have high tone on the
root or suffix. In the present tense it is not readily audible as the present tense is generally
monosyllabic so there is no adjacent non-high syllable for comparison. In (12) and (12´) the
pitch contour is not identical: bú in (12´) is higher than bólx in (12), and bù in (12) is higher
than àaz in (12´). In (12´) the first accented word has high accent and high tone, so it is
higher in pitch than the first accented word of (12).
Though this is less certain, it appears that in clauses with verb-second word order
(§30.2.3) the verb has high accent and its separated prefix or preverbal word, which is clausefinal, has low accent. That is, a verb-second clause does not have an orthodox IP consisting
of the rightmost two tonic syllables; rather, the same accent contour spans the entire clause.
A simple example with a short clause is in (43), where forms of d.ieza 'need, want' are in4. Prosody and prosodic wordhood109second position.55 For clarity the high accent mark is placed before the entire verb, not on the
tonic syllable.

'he (evidently) needed money' (nonwitnessed)The rise-fall pitch is imposed by the tone, and the syllable of a verb that it falls on is
determined by the tone of the verb form. As a result, there is actually a phonetic contrast in
tone on stressed syllables, as the imperfect (with its rise-fall on the root syllable) differs in
tone from nonfinite forms, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, etc. (with stress on the initial
syllable). A minimal triad, shown in (44), comes from the conjugation type in which
witnessed past, imperfect, and verbal noun all have the same root vocalism (all have the same
segmental suffix or ending -(a)r). Here the circumflex is used for the rise-fall and the acute
accent for the pitch accompanying ordinary stress.

'fighting, a fight' (verbal noun)On all three of the forms the tonic syllable is the first one, as indicated by its amplitude and
the reduction of all posttonic vowels (in the witnessed past the second syllable has the same
schwa quality as in the other two forms). Impressionistically, the witnessed past sounds
rather like a Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian disyllable with rising pitch (though the sharp fall to a
low tone in the following word, i.e. after the high-fall tone, is unlike Bosnian/Croatian/
Serbian). The verbal noun sounds like an initial-stressed word in any stress language, or like
a word with a falling tone in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian. The imperfect, with its sharp rise
(clearly audible even on a short vowel) and sharp fall to a low pitch on the following syllable,
sounds like something one expects to find only in a language with a system of contrastive
contour tones.
There is a tendency for diphthongs to be pronounced as rising under the rise-fall tone and
falling under ordinary stress:

Meaning: Often this tense is a fairly typical north Eurasian evidential present perfect,
indicating a past event with present results when the speaker has not witnessed the event. The
aspect is perfective: the event has occurred and the result is in force, so the endpoint of telic,
punctual, and ingressive aktionsart is realized. This tense can be used in ordinary narrative
where the speaker did not see the event but sees (or has seen) the result and infers the event,
but it can also be used where the speaker has not seen the result and is not inferring anything.
It is the usual tense for narration of legends, myths, folktales, jokes, stories heard from others,
and the like, and also the usual tense of proverbs. Thus the basic meaning can be described as
a perfective event with a result, where the speaker has not necessarily witnessed the event.
To Ingush speakers, the most salient meaning seems to be the fact that the speaker did not
witness the event, and this is usually the only property mentioned by language consultants.
However, the verb occurs with good frequency in the first person singular, where it naturally
indicates events which the speaker has witnessed and/or performed, so the meaning that is
salient to speakers is not the only meaning of this form.
An example of narrative in the nonwitnessed tense is this passage set in the middle ages.

replace the low accent.
The proclitics my= (imperative negative), cy= (nonfinite negative), chy= 'in, into', and
t'y= 'on, onto' do not have stress but have high tone (§4.2) which causes the following tonic
word to have lower pitch, which I transcribe as low accent on the tonic syllable. Phrases like

"12.2. Regular verb classes107
Verbs have almost no lexically conditioned differences of inflectional endings, but
regular verbs fall into 16 ablaut classes. A representative verb of each class is shown in Table
12-1 and the negative forms in Table 12-2. There are three ablaut grades or stem forms: the
infinitive stem (used in infinitive, verbal noun, and negative forms), the present stem (used in
present, imperfect, and future tenses and converbs), and the past stem (used in the witnessed
past and nonwitnessed tenses, the pluperfect, and anterior converbs).
The last four conjugation classes have only a few members each, but are nonetheless
regular.
The verb d.iez is a regular verb of Class I except that it has an ending -a in the present
tense, obligatorily in the senses 'ought to' (valence: Genitive Infinitive) and 'should' (case
attraction and Infinitive) and optionally in the sense 'like, love' (Dative Nominative): d.ieza
vs. d.edz. The verb d.aagh 'sit, be sitting' is a regular verb of Class III except for having the
same ending -a in the present tense: vaagha 'he is sitting'.
The conjugation classes are not ancient. The ablaut grades are not reconstructible to PreProto-Nakh, but rather arose as umlaut, when the root vowel assimilated in height and/or
roundness to the vowel of the ending (which subsequently reduced to schwa).108106Below the gender marker is called a prefix, as is usual in Nakh-Daghestanian grammars, but in
several respects it behaves more like an initial consonant than an affix.

dialect which has no umlaut. An English summary of some of the sound changes and dialect

VERB STRUCTURE AND DERIVATION
15.0. Introduction. Position classes in the verb
The Ingush verbal lexicon is split into two parts. Simple verbs are a closed class. As a
class they take all available suffixal derivations. In their derivational behavior they are
ergative, with a nominative pivot that can never be replaced by another case. Every valence
must contain a nominative. Compound verbs are formed with light verbs. They are an open
and productive class. Their derivational behavior is restricted to the possibilities open to the
light verb, and most compound verbs are accusative in derivational behavior. The lexically
heavy element is often etymologically the nominative O of the light verb, and as soon as it
ceases to be an argument the verb has ceased to have a nominative argument. Thus the
nominative argument is not obligatory for compound verbs. Agreement in compound verbs is
with the nominative argument if there is one (I call this external agreement), or it can be
fixed, as happens where the heavy element is historically the nominative argument, so that the
verb carries frozen agreement with that element (I call this internal agreement).
There are twelve position slots in the Ingush verb, shown in (1) on the next page. Not all
slots can be filled at once: for instance, the chaining particle occurs only with converbs,
which lack the tense-mood categories signaled by the auxiliary verb occupying slots 10-12.
Several different kinds of elements can occur in slot 2, but only one can occur in any given
verb form; their ranking for access to this slot is discussed below. The fillers of slots are
variously affixes, words, proclitics, and enclitics. Slots 1-4 are a flat string; 5-12 are a
hierarchically organized sequence of main verb (with its affixes) and light verb (with its
affixes).
The minimal possible verb word is position 6, the unexpanded root, which occurs in the
present tense: xou 'know(s)', joax 's/he says, they say'. Examples of more complex verb
forms are (2)-(3) (numbers in the interlinear are position slots as above):

"1.2. Typological overview of Ingush
Ingush has a fairly large consonant system with three manners of articulation (voiced,
voiceless, ejective) and including uvulars and pharyngeals. Ejectives are not particularly
forceful and plain voiceless stops are not aspirated, so plain-ejective contrast is less audible
than in most languages of the Caucasus. Pharyngealization (phonetically, epiglottalization)
is a phonation property of syllables, audible mostly on the vowel but its distribution based
mostly on the onset consonant. There is a minimal tone system, and a distinctive descending
""sawtooth"" prosody that very demarcates phrases. The vowel system is large, with
diphthongization of most of the long vowels and much centralization of the short vowels.
There is an underlying long/short opposition which surfaces partly as length and partly as a
tense/lax opposition; there is a schwa, whose elision produces long vowels in open syllables
and thereby phonemicizes pure length at least for some speakers. Those speakers who can
hear schwas seem to perceive them as something other than vowels; still, in chanting, other
metric genres, and the speech of some of the oldest generations schwas are audible as vowels,
and those schwas that occur in what I call restressed position are full vowels (and heard as
such). This system of vowel-zero alternations, different sources of length, and schwas with
unusual phonetic status makes it almost impossible to devise a writing system that is
straightforwardly phonemic, a situation that makes it very difficult to achieve literacy given
the way Ingush is taught. Other aspects of the Ingush orthography make it very difficult to
sound out words or spell correctly based on pronunciation.
Ingush is a mostly dependent-marking language. Nouns and pronouns distinguish eight
basic cases and some further secondary ones, whose endings are mostly monoexponential (i.e.
non-cumulative) and, in the plural, follow a separate plural suffix. There are four gender
agreement markers which distinguish, depending on how one counts them, up to eight
genders. Gender agreement is a partial category: only about 30% of the verb roots and 10%
of the adjective roots take gender agreement. Ingush also has overt inherent gender, where
the gender-bearing noun itself has a prefix marking its gender; this is also a partial category,
and is usually but not always the same as the agreement gender class of the noun.
Verbs distinguish a very large number of tenses, which blend aspect and evidentiality
with pure tense. In addition to these there is stem-internal marking of plurality (of S/O)
and/or pluractionality, both partial categories. Apart from the tenses, Ingush distinguishes
various kinds of evidentiality and mirativity by other means such as suffixation and particles.
The three word classes of noun, verb, and adjective are strictly differentiated
inflectionally, syntactically, and in terms of word formation, but they are not on equal footing
in the language. Ingush has a noun-based lexicon: elementary noun roots are an open class,1. The Ingush language and its speakers11while verb and adjective roots are closed classes (about 200 members each). The verbal
lexicon is split: the basic verbs (the closed class) have consistently ergative alignment in their
agreement and derivation, and take the full set of suffixal valence-affecting derivations; the
open class is phrasal predicates with light verbs, and they are mostly accusative in alignment
and limited in derivational possibilities (since most of the light verbs are transitive, while
several derivational categories are limited to intransitives). Basic verbs are mostly
intransitive and form semantic causatives by morphological transitivization; phrasal
predicates and compound verbs form causatives by transitivity-neutral processes such as
suppletion and change of light verb. Adjectives and manner adverbs are not formally distinct,
and neither are converbs and participles. On the other hand, attributive and non-attributive
adjectives, participals, and cardinal numerals are kept strictly distinct.
The numerals are base-ten for the first two decades and base-twenty thereafter. They
form an unusually rich set of derivatives such as ordinals, distributives, nominalized forms,
plex forms, and others.
Verbs form a large set of converbs: three basic ones (anterior, sequential, simultaneous)
used in chaining and a large set used in various kinds of adjunct subordination. There is
rather little finite subordination and almost no subordinating conjunctions; converb clauses
and nominalization are the main devices for complementation and adjunct subordination.
Though verbs of perception generally have dative subjects and stative one-argument
phrasal verbs often have ergative subjects, making it possible to classify Ingush as split
intransitive, it is nonetheless consistently ergative overall, in the morphology of agreement,
case, and verbal derivation, and in syntax. There are almost no valence alternations (such as a
locative alternation). There are derivations that change valence or argument structure
(inceptive, causative) but no inflectional or syntactically-based passivization or the like.
There is extensive and systematic long-distance reflexivization, accusative to neutral in
its alignment, subject- and object-controlled, and partly working to overcome the coreference
problems inherent in contexts of obviation.
Phrases are head-final. Clause word order is like that of early Germanic: verb-final with
frequent verb-second order in main clauses (with prefixes and first elements of compound
verbs left in clause-final position). In most kinds of complex sentences the finite clause
follows the converb clauses. Where English would use clause or VP coordination with
conjunction reduction, Ingush uses chaining and therefore imposes a grammatically rigid
framework with argument sharing and strict choice of verb forms with sequence of tenses on
what would, in English, be a much freer matter of juxtaposing or coordinating sentences with
the same subject or topic. Relativization uses deletion, and unlike chaining and various forms
of nonfinite complementation, which have strict case and/or valence constraints on sharing,
there are almost no constraints on what can be relativized.
Sentences are also mostly head-final, in that most chained and many subordinate clauses
precede the main clause. Controllers of coreference-constrained phenomena, and overt
tokens of shared arguments, are generally in the main clause. Controlled phenomena
themselves can and often do extend far to the left. Long-distance reflexivization and case-12Ingush Grammarbased argument sharing in core chaining, in particular, can extend over many clauses.
Logophoricity affects the immediately dominated clause. These and other factors that require
calculating from the end of the sentence while producing it from the beginning indicate that
fluent speech, especially narrative, requires a good deal of advance planning on the part of the
speaker. Even the phrase and clause prosody require parsing starting from the right edge of
the constituent. Though the Berkeley Ingush Corpus contains mostly the speech of the older,
fully fluent generations and most of my elicitation has been done with fully fluent speakers,
what information I have on the younger generations indicates that many of them are no longer
in full command of the grammatical phenomena requiring this extent of advance planning. If
this is indeed the case, and the younger generation cannot construct complex narrative in
Ingush, the language is becoming restricted in its ability to handle one of the essential
everyday functions.","[33, 34, 35]"

INFLECTIONAL CATEGORIES OF THE VERB
13.0. Introduction
Ingush has a large number of tenses and moods which combine with aktionsart and
pluractionality categories (Chapter 14) to create a very rich system of tense-aspect-mood
distinctions. This chapter describes the forms and meanings of the TAM categories.
Appendix 1 includes full inflectional tables for two simplex verbs. Tables 12-1 and 12-2 in
Chapter 12 show the main forms for one verb of each conjugation class.
Ingush has tenses that I have labeled narrative past and narrative pluperfect because they
are used primarily in narrative. Speakers also use a narrative present discourse strategy,
which involves shifting some tenses to present and some simulfactives to pluractional. Since
this is a discourse strategy for the use of tenses rather than a distinct tense or set of tenses, it is
described in Chapter 33 on discourse (§33. 4).
Ingush is notably sensitive to evidentiality, and speakers generally comment on the
evidentiality rather than on the aspect or tense when asked to explain the meaning of a tense.
I have tried to label tenses based on the most salient meanings, so the tense that might have
been called aorist is termed witnessed past here and what might have been called perfect is
termed nonwitnessed.
13.0.1. Overview of TAM formation. Recall from Chapter 12 that regular verbs mostly have
the root shape CVC and several irregular ones have the shape CV; and that there are three
stem forms, marked by different ablaut grades in regular verbs: present, past, and infinitive.
To these stems are added various tense/mood endings. (Morphophonemics are explained
below with the individual tenses and moods.) The forms with their endings are shown in (1).

-l and all in vowel (most of which are irregular)-ieThere are also a good number of tense/aspect/mood auxiliaries, chiefly forms of the verbs 'be',
which are postposed to one or another suffixed form (most often a converb). The auxiliaries
take the full range of tense forms and may themselves be complex with further auxiliaries. It
seems that all possible combinations of base forms, auxiliaries, and tenses of auxiliaries
occur, and the meanings of the combinations are partly but not entirely predictable from the
sum of the parts. Here I have described only those that occur with sufficient frequency in the
Berkeley Ingush Corpus to support descriptions in standard terms.
For practical purposes the tenses can be divided into suffixed ones and those formed with
auxiliaries. Some of the tense suffixes have distinctive morphophophonemics that point to an
origin in clitics, and some are etymologically identical to independent verb forms and must
once have been auxiliaries, but they are all suffixes at this point. The auxiliaries are written
as separate words in Ingush spelling, and they are separate syntactic words: they can be
moved by word-order rules, can stand alone as answers to questions, etc., and some of them
can determine the case of the subject, overriding the lexical verb's case assignment.
13.0.2. Idiosyncratic tenses. There are two verbs 'be': neutral d.y (an irregular verb) and
delimited xul (regular). Their forms were shown in Table 12-3. Both verbs function as
lexical verbs and also provide TAM auxiliaries. Neutral 'be' has a defective stem paradigm
with only a present stem and the forms based on it. It has a plain past tense, which no other
verb has; all other verbs have imperfect, witnessed past, and others which neutral 'be' lacks. It
also has a synthetic negative simultaneous converb d.oacazh and a synthetic negative
interrogative d.iec=ii. All other verbs have analytic forms here.
13.0.3. Interlinears. Some of the tense and mood forms would require very long interlinears
if the interlinears were fully explicit. Compare the two interlinears of the same form (irrealis
converb of the negative pluperfect) in (2): the first one completely interlinearizes both the
lexical stem b.eaxaa- (an anterior converb) and the tense auxiliary b.iec- (a form of 'be'); the13. Verb inflectional categories245second leaves out some of the information about two pieces and is both shorter and more
informative about tense because it labels the tense as a whole.
(2) a. beaxaa-biecarie
B.live.CVant-B.be:NEG.PST.CVirr
if (they) hadn't lived (0415.12)b. beaxaa-biecarie
B.live-B.NEG.NW.CVirrFor several of the inferential and progressive tenses (§§13.3, 13.4), if the interlinear shows the
full analysis of the auxiliary or each component of the auxiliary, the TAM category of the
whole form is not indicated anywhere. If there is not a separate interlinear for each
component, then at least when the components are written as separate words (as when
separated by interposed clitics, or when so spelled in the orthography) it is not clear what
those pieces mean. For these reasons I have generally interlinearized the last element of the
auxiliary with no lexical gloss but just the name of the entire category, e.g.:
(3) pwa hwearchaa
xannab
feud enmesh.CVant NARP.B (narrative past, B gender agreeing with pwa)
he had gotten involved in a vendetta
(4) vaxaa
xannaxugvy
V.go.CVant INFRnw.V
(nonwitnessed inferential tense)
(he) must have gone (there) (taken from (82) below)
or, more explicitly:
(5) vaxaa
xanna
xugvy
V.go.CVant be.CVant INFRnw.V
(he) must have gone (there)(nonwitnessed inferential tense)Where these same forms serve as main verbs they have lexical interlinears and glosses:
(6) xannab
be.NW.B
(they) were; (they) became
(7) xugvy
be.FUT.V
(he) will be246Ingush Grammar13.1. Simple (synthetic) tenses
Simple, or synthetic, tenses consist of the verb stem and the ending. The ending can
include a cliticized form of 'be' (as the future and nonwitnessed endings do), but the whole is
a single phonological and syntactic word. In contrast, the analytic tenses have an auxiliary
which is a separate phonological word and (except for the inferential tenses) a separate
syntactic word (it can assign case to the verb's subject, overriding the case lexically governed
by the verb but making no changes in argument structure and having no effect on the object
case).
13.1.1. Present tense. Form: Present stem plus present ending. For most verbs (and all
but two regular verbs), the present tense suffix is zero. Since the root-final consonant is then
in word-final position, final gemination occurs (§3.3.1).
Meaning: This is more properly a generic present tense, having much the same force as
the English simple present: 'reads', 'calls', etc.

"21. Valence, argument structure, and alignment479Not all speakers are able to distinguish or comment on these meaning differences. A Google
search for "" "" (dieza aaz, with ergative) and "" "" (dieza sy, with genitive) and
analogous constructions with other pronouns showed that they have similar frequencies, with
ergative slightly predominating.
(74)-(75) are an elicited minimal pair for 'can, may'.166 Case attraction:167
166The forms meg and mog differ in ablaut, i.e. in conjugation class. There is no other pair of
Ingush verbs that differs in only this way, so it is not a straightforward matter to say whether these
are inflectional variants of the same verb or different verbs. I assume their different valence
patterns suffice to make them different verbs. Kibrik 1981:36 (2003:624-625) shows that the Tsez
verb with meanings similar to meg takes either case attraction or case assignment. (The Ingush
and Tsez verbs are not cognate.)
167
Other languages of the north Caucasus have a similar opposition of case attraction and case
assignment with modals and the like, and the literature (Forker 2010, Matasovi 2009, Kibrik
1981:36 [2003:624-625], Polinsky & Potsdam 2002, Haspelmath 1996:178-9, Harris 1995; Harris
& Campbell 1995:187-9 for progressive tenses) shows that (in languages where enough testing has
been done, chiefly Daghestanian languages) there is a syntactic difference between the two
constructions: the one with case attraction is monoclausal, so that a single surface predicate assigns
the case, while that with non-attraction is a biclausal construction with the finite auxiliary
assigning case to its subject and the subject of the infinitive non-overt because coreferential. Word
order and scope of modifiers establish the difference. In Ingush the situation is different. The
infinitive and modal verb (dieza, meg) are prosodically unified to form a single IP. Arguments or
other clause members generally cannot intervene between the infinitive and the modal. Negation,
adverbs, etc. can be understood to have scope over one or the other verb or over both, but this
cannot be overtly marked by changing the position of the adverb or negation (and in particular not
by putting it between the two verbs). Word order of arguments is more or less templatic (subject
precedes object, direct object precedes verb, interrogative word immediately precedes verb) and
does not serve to preserve constituency relations between verbs and arguments. All of this is
equally true regardless of the case of the subject. The examples below illustrate these various
points. (iii) and (v) (marked with minus signs) are stylistically less good but fully grammatical.

"16. Non-inflecting words38516.2.1. Clitics. Clitics have a number of more or less grammatical functions in Ingush:
coordinating and chaining enclitic conjunctions ='a, =ji; focus clitics =m, =q; negative
proclitics cy=, my=; emphatic proclitic my=; interrogative =ii, -i For their properties see
§5.6.1 (with references to discussion and examples).
16.2.2. Phonologically isolating formatives. These words are phonological words (i.e.
non-clitics) but not syntactic words. I mention them here because they do not belong to any
of the inflecting parts of speech, though in fact each such formative fits into a larger paradigm
that can be considered an inflectional paradigm. Examples are given elsewhere.

"Tense/aspect/mood categories are signaled by the ablaut grade of the root and the ending.
There are also analytic tenses, such as the progressive tenses, signaled by a combination of
converb and tense auxiliary (not shown in (1)). There is no person agreement. About 30% of
the simple verbs take gender agreement marked by mutation of the initial consonant; the
others have no gender agreement in the root. (Some endings and a number of derivational
suffixes and light verbs and tense auxiliaries also agree in gender, so though only 30% of the
roots agree in gender, probably well over 50% of the inflected verb forms have gender
agreement somewhere.) Negation, not shown in (1), is suffixal in finite forms and proclitic
elsewhere (§13.12). The first clitic slot includes proclitic nonfinite negation and the chaining
enclitic ='a (§24.4); both can be present in the same verb form. The final clitic slot includes
pragmatic and evidential proclitics and some postverbal particles that are unstressed but not

a root in an ablaut grade and an ending, and continuing with more complex inflected forms.
The ablaut grade of the stem (past, present, infinitive) is shown after the colon (in these
examples only and not in the rest of the grammar). Tense auxiliaries (here and throughout the

In most respects, Ingush verb morphology conforms to the standard expectations that
marking of derivational categories is inside of inflectional categories and more outer elements
have scope over more inner ones. Thus the deictic prefix, which is in the first slot, situates
the entire predicate, including its local prefix, in space. Derivational suffixes are followed by
inflectional endings (tense, aspect, mood: see Chapter 13), and these are followed by
pragmatic and evidential clitics and other elements which qualify or comment on the entire12. Verb conjugation classes237predicate including the inflectional categories. There are departures from this neat picture,
however, most of them involving agreement. Gender agreement is marked by mutation of the
root-initial consonant (see Chapters 7 and 19),106 but the future and nonwitnessed tenses also
have gender agreement in their endings, and tense auxiliaries (not shown in (1)) may have
gender agreement initially and/or in endings. Gender agreement is inflection, but as it has no
place in the semantics it cannot be said that the various and often multiple markings of gender
are actual exceptions to a generalization based on scope. Plurality (plural number agreement)
and pluractionality (multiple action) in verbs (for which see Chapter 14) are expressed rootinternally, by changes of the final consonant(s) and/or by suppletion. Tense is expressed by
both endings (relatively outer affixes, as is expected) and ablaut of the verb root (the
innermost position).","[258, 259, 260]"

preposed to a verb and there is no preverbal host for that clitic, the verb root is reduplicated

GENDER
This chapter is partly taken from Nichols 2007, which describes gender in Chechen and
gives Chechen-Ingush-Batsbi comparison and reconstruction. Only the gender classification
of nouns and its marking are described here; for the morphosyntax of gender agreement and
gender resolution see Chapter 19.
Gender in Nakh-Daghestanian languages is sometimes called class or noun class, but I
follow Corbett 1991 in using the term gender.
Gender in Ingush (and its close sisters) takes two forms, which I call agreement gender
and overt inherent gender. Agreement gender (§7.1) is the marking of gender on some verbs
and modifiers in agreement with the inherent gender of a noun or pronoun. Overt inherent
gender (§7.3; abbreviated OIG) is overt marking of gender on the gender-bearing noun itself.
Elsewhere in this grammar, gender refers to agreement gender unless otherwise indicated;
OIG is discussed mostly in §7.3, and is always explicitly called OIG.
Gender of all kinds is a partial category. A minority of verb roots and a smaller minority
of adjective roots take gender agreement. All nouns (or nearly all; see §7.2) trigger
agreement gender, but a minority of nouns have OIG. That is, the majority of words in the
agreeing parts of speech lack the agreement slot; agreement gender characterizes nearly every
noun but is not overt; and OIG occurs on a small minority of nouns (and the agreement
gender class of a noun is not necessarily the same as its OIG). Though it might seem that
opportunities to discover the gender of a noun would be fewer than learners need, in fact
gender marking in phrases and (especially) clauses is quite frequent. That minority of verbs
that agree in gender include most of the auxiliaries; gender-agreeing affixes or clitics are part
of the marking of certain tenses; and in Ingush, which disfavors utterance of any phrase
without a predicate (§5.10), noun phrases that might be syntactically independent or uttered in
isolation in a western European language are accompanied by gender-agreeing forms of 'be'.","[163, 164]"
"CHAPTER 1
THE INGUSH LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSIn 2007 I began a cross-linguistic survey of complexity across several domains of
grammar (phonology, morphology, lexicon) using grammatical features already present in
available databases and a genealogically based sample of languages including Ingush, my
long-term field language. To my surprise, Ingush turned out to be the most complex language
of my sample, besting even polysynthetic languages like Seneca, Lakhota, and Halkomelem.
Ingush is not polysynthetic; its complexity is due to large inventories of elements (phonemes,
cases, tenses, etc.), a high degree of inflectional synthesis in the verb, and classification of
various types – declension and conjugation classes, agreement genders, overt inherent
genders, split verbal lexicon, split alignment, etc. Perhaps this complexity explains why it has
taken thirty years to produce this grammar, during most of which time the project has in fact
been on or near the front burner.","[23, 24]"
"32.4.2. Rhetorical questions. Rhetorical yes-no questions with emphatic my are
extremely common in Ingush discourse; see §33.2.1 for their functions and several examples.
Very often my VERB=ii functions almost as a definiteness marker or reminder of common
knowledge that explains or justifies what the speaker says.

A rhetorical yes-no question without my indicates that the hearer probably knows the identity
of the referent, and sometimes elicits a nod or affirmation from the listener. Often such a
phrase is followed by a repeat of its subject without the interrogative verb:

"29.6. Obviation
Obviation is the obligatory ranking of third person nominals (nouns, pronouns) based on
discourse function, syntactic relations, and semantic properties such as animacy. One
nominal in a clause is proximate (as are all its coreferents); the others (and their coreferents)
are obviative. Proximate outranks obviative for access to syntactic roles and processes.
Languages differ in whether and how they require that obviation ranking be aligned with
syntactic relations and animacy ranking. (This analysis of obviation, and the examples and
criteria below, are all due to Aissen 1997.)
Since both possessors and subjects are proximate by definition, in languages with
obviation the following two kinds of configurations are problematic or impossible because
they make two different referents compete for proximate status. (In these schematic English
examples the asterisk means not that the English sentence is ungrammatical but that its
equivalent in a language with obviation would be ungrammatical.)662Ingush Grammar(a) possessor of subject is coreferential to object (bad because possessor is proximate,
therefore subject is obviative and object proximate, therefore obviation and grammatical
relations are misaligned): *Musai's wife is looking for himi; *Musai's friends scared himi. The
same configuration is acceptable where the coreferential nominals are not third person: your
wife is looking for you, etc.
(b) main-clause subject (proximate) is coreferential to subordinate-clause object (which
is then outranked by an obviative subject in the subordinate clause): *Mariemi asked when
Musa had seen heri.
When animacy is aligned with obviation, animates are proximate and inanimates
obviative. In such languages a third configuration is problematic or ungrammatical:
(c) inanimate subject and animate object of transitive verb, e.g. *the snow covered the
sheep.
Obviation has so far been attested only in head-marking languages (Aissen 1997:743),
where strictly grammatical constraints such as obviation are functionally valuable because
they can narrow down the assignment of reference and syntactic relations to formally
unmarked nominals. Something much like obviation is also evident in Ingush, a strongly
dependent-marking language, where it shows up as otherwise inexplicable gaps in formal
antecedence, i.e. in contexts like (a) above. Here are Ingush examples for contexts (a), (b),
and (c).
(a) Third person possessors of subjects cannot formally antecede objects. Asterisked
examples here are ungrammatical where possessor and third person pronoun are coreferential
(but may be grammatical if they are non-coreferential).

"2. Sound system27There is a merger or near-merger of /i/ and /y/ in the past tense forms and anterior
converb of verbs like /duz/, where /i/ is written by Imnaishvili 1977 and Mal'sagov 1925 and
in the orthography, but many speakers pronounce [y] and most hear /y/. Thus:

[diz˙r]  [diz˙r] 'filled' (wit. past)  (In such words, even speakers who pronounce [i] and those who seem to hear /i/ do not have
palatalization of the initial /d/. They do, however, palatalize /d/ in root words such as /di/
'day' [dji].) I have transcribed these words, and some others with variation or near-merger,
with /i/ or /y/ as I hear them, without attempting to settle on a standard spelling.
Consistent with its origin, in tonic words /y/ is usually spelled either “i” or “u” in the
Cyrillic orthography. In restressed clitics it is spelled “a” (as schwa usually is).

one or two auxiliaries: the converb and any other non-final forms are interlinearized as

Words that have no interlinears are: names, where recognizable; Russian loans, where
obvious and reognizable; and the pause particles dii hwuona, diecii hwuona, etc. (§33.3.2).
Abbreviations. In a morphologically complex language like Ingush, it is a challenge to
keep interlinear abbreviations short enough that more than three or four words can be
accommodated in one print line when they are aligned with their interlinears. The
undesirable alternatives are greatly spaced-out Ingush examples, expansion of the physical
size of the grammar, or hard-to-read unaligned interlinears. The Berkeley Ingush Corpus
practice has been to use two- and three-letter interlinears for the highest-frequency
morphemes and in general to keep abbreviations as short as possible. The zero inflectional
suffix for the nominative case is not interlinearized; a noun gloss with no case notation
indicates nominative case.

MIRxvData sources
Most of the examples used here are from the Berkeley Ingush Corpus, which contains
mostly natural speech of various kinds, chiefly from speakers from the oldest generations,
recorded as part of my documentation project Itt Ezar Sahwat 'Ten thousand hours', whose
goal is to create a very large corpus of spoken Ingush adequate for corpus and language
processing research – some 100 million words or 10,000 hours – while speakers with full
command of the native vocabulary and grammar and the traditional culture and usage can still
be found. The corpus drawn on for this grammar has about 100,000 words of fully annotated
text and about 150,000 partly annotated or transcribed but not annotated. Most of the
transcribing and annotation has been done by myself with the assistance of native speakers,
chiefly Sultan Mereshkov and Lilia Tarieva. Some spoken and folklore texts were transcribed
by David A. Peterson and Ronald L. Sprouse in 1995-1999. Some of the fieldnotes were
elicited by Peterson (especially work on verbal valence), Sprouse (adjectives, verbal valence),
Heather Rose Jones (motion and position verbs), and Lisa Conathan (vocabulary). The Frog
Story text was recorded, transcribed, and annotated by Jonathan Segal and Nancy Urban.
Pear Story narratives were recorded by Sultan Mereshkov and transcribed by Zarina
Molochieva in a project directed by Balthasar Bickel.
Examples from natural speech texts have source indications with a text number (e.g.
0204A); those from printed sources have letter abbreviations which are keyed to entries in
Sources at the end of the book; those with no source indication are elicited; and those found
in Internet searches have url's and access dates. To judge from the numbers of examples
found in Internet searches, I estimate that the total amount of Ingush writing available online
as of late 2010 is at most ten times the size of the Berkeley Ingush Corpus, i.e. a few million
words, most of it journalistic with smaller amounts of folklore, literature, and chats. May it
grow and flourish.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

Quasi-arguments (subcategorized goals and locations: §22.1) are positioned much like
objects, preceding the verb and following the subject, e.g. (31).
Manner adverbs immediately precede the verb, following all arguments but preceding
any prefixes and proclitics, e.g. dika in (27).
There are certain grammatical factors that change this ordering:
Topicalization. Topics are usually clause-initial, e.g. (79)-(82) below and §33.3.2.
Possibly a special case of topicalization is examples that appear to be quantifier float, with the
quantifier in preverbal position and the topic clause-final.

3s.INS D.be.PRS now matter
now it's entirely up to him ('with him') (0816)Focus. A focused word or phrase follows a topic but precedes the rest of the clause
(§30.4, also (79)-(82) below).
Extraction. One or another word, especially a possessor or an argument, is likely to be
sentence-final, perhaps for prosodic reasons: §30.5.
A few morphemes that figure in the literature on adverbs and adjuncts have idiosyncratic
ordering in Ingush because they are clitics or preverbs. qy '(any) more' is a clitic, usually
clause-initial but occasionally initial in a smaller domain (see §5.6.1). Negation is a suffix on
finite verb forms and proclitic cy= on nonfinite forms; prohibition is a proclitic my=. 'Again'
is an incorporable adverb and therefore often found as a preverb (§15.5.3).
30.2.3. Verb-second order. For main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new
ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or
analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the
clause.
