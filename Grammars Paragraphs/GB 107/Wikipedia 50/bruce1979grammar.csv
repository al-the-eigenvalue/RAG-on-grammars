"The logical relationsbetween clauses are described there and a tendency for old or

"In practice,of course, it is virtually impossible to describe a language
without recourse to some meta-language and quite impractical to
attempt to avoid the use of any formalism.
For those reasons, and in an effort to meet the second goal
of this thesis to make the granunar presented herein as use·ful
as possible, 1) formal devices will be used sparingly, to
enhance the presentation of significant generalizations in the
granun ar; 2)we will not be bound to one particular theoreticalmodel; an d 3 ) informal discussions will characterize the grarranar
throughout.
More specifically, the basic theoretical framework employedin the presentation of the phonological system is Generative
Phonology.",[20]

Linguistic science is apparently stil l at the stage where

"Semantically clauses are discussed in terms of a predicate
(manifested by a verb) an d its associated arguments (manifested

"7Moreover, as formal theories become. outmoded,
as is happening at an ever-increasing rate,
descriptions of exotic languages made on the

less useful.
I thin k the time h_as come for
a return to the tradition of informal
descriptions of exotic languages, written
whenever possible in clear prose rather than
in formal· rules, so that such descriptions
will still be useful and informative when
present theories are long forgotten.

is likely to be more true now than it was when it was said
six or so years ago.","[19, 20]"
"On the other hand,an effort has been made. to facilitate the use of this granunar
in cross-lingui9t� c comparisons by other linguists, e.g., by
cross-referencing between sections of the grammar, by discussing
subsystems in one place in the grammar as well as discussing the
units in those subsystems in the different parts of the granunar
where they actually function, and by correlating certain Alamblak
facts with current investigations in universal grammar.
The granunar contains comments on certain theoretical
questions where the structure of Alamblak is particularly
re-levant.",[21]
"These are termedparticipant roles because 'participant' emphasizes the crucial
involvement that the referents of these nuclear NP's have in the
predicated situation.
The clause structure assigns only a general role to NP's in
the clause,oblique NP's being typically more precisely indicatedthan nuclear NP�s.",[24]
"Theoretical discussionsare only secondary to the primary 'aims of the grammar, however.
Inasmuch as v arious theoretical approaches will be employedat various points in the grarrunar,there may be certain constructsused which are unfamiliar to the reader or they may be used in
ways which are different from what the reader is accustomed to.
The next section is therefore devoted to introducing and
discussing some of the se notions.",[21]
"The secondary goal is to present the granunarin a way which will mqke it a useful and lasting reference for
investigators of Language and languages.",[18]
"The Alamblak verb (cf. C hapter V) is potentially a highlycomplicated polysynthetic unit manifesting various patterns of
serialized verb, noun, adj ective, and Time Word roots.
The clause is dominated by its semantic role structure
although referential structure does play a minor role in the
organization of the clause.",[17]
"Acknowl'edgement isdue to many individuals who have contributed in various
ways to the completion of this dissertation.
In many ways this study has been only a part of a contin­
uing interest in the Alamblak people and their language.",[12]

"A categorization of roles into Modal and Orienta­tion roles is merely for convenience of discussion and is in no
way crucial to the description of the claus e.
The roles of the nuclear NP's viz. , Actor,Undergoer, andObject, are directly indicated by the clause structure. The
limitation of three roles in the claus e structure and their
tenninology was inspired by A. Hale (19 74).",[24]
