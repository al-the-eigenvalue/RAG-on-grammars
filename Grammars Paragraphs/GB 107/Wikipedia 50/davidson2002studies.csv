The speaker is pointing out landmarks to his nephew who has been away for many years as a
slave among the Quinaults. Several sentences earlier we are explicitly told of the nephew’s ignorance of the area: ‘He [the addressee of (409)] did not know where they were going as they returned home, because he had become a slave when he was still small.’
Although the subject of the relative clause in (410) is grammatically first person, the possessive clitic signals that the subject is the possessor of the S argument (§7.3.4), the grandfather, who
is thus the referent whose status is at issue. This is the first mention of him in the text and the
relative clause occurs with the Indefinite Relative.

The identity of the referent in (411) is unidentifiable to both speaker and addressee because
the event referred to has not yet occurred.

but only its identity. In (412), the first person referent is obviously already a discourse participant,
but his identity as a Kyuquot is emphasized by the Indefinite Relative.

The Indefinite Relative frequently occurs with the dubitative formative <(v)t9r to form
various types of irrealis relative clauses. The vowel of the Indefinite appears short instead of long
in this construction, which undoubtedly indicates some degree of grammaticalization in the combination of these formatives, though I do not find it necessary to consider it an entirely separate
mood as Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242) do.
a) The dubitative Indefinite Relative is used in indirect questions after predicates expressing
lack of knowledge or understanding:

See Rose (1981: 226-29) for a more detailed account of the Indefinite in Kyuquot dialect,
where its functions have expanded somewhat so that it appears as a general indefinite mood in
non-relative as well as relative clauses.
7.2.15 Content and Polar Interrogatives (Makah)
Makah has a mood for forming content questions and another for polar (‘yes/no’) questions.104
The Content Interrogative attaches to an interrogative word like F`C`p ‘who’ or v@r` ‘where’,
which functions as predicate head. The word may be underived, consisting of an interrogative
root alone (all the interrogative roots are free roots) (416), or derived, consisting of the interrogative root plus lexical suffixes (417).

The Interrogative mood in Nuuchahnulth is used in forming both content questions and yes/no
questions. In content questions it attaches to an interrogative functioning as predicate head. As in
Makah, the interrogative may be underived (420) or derived (421).

Note that inclusion of the discourse particle v@ (obviously related to the verb v@ ‘say, tell’)
indicates a positively biased question, i.e. a question expecting an affirmative answer (422)a.
Negative bias can be indicated by the formative <F@ following the Interrogative (Swadesh
1939: 83). Unfortunately, this construction is not attested in the corpus.
The Interrogative can co-occur with the quotative formative C:

The semantic differences between the Inferential I and II moods are as yet unclear. In (424) the
Inferential II denotes discovery of the situation of the predicate. Evidential force arises from the
fact that the occurrence of the event is discovered on the basis of later evidence.

However, the Inferential I clitic can also have this sense.
One formal difference between the two clitics is that the Inferential II is frequently accompanied by pi@ ‘(be) thus, so’ (425) or the enclitic <pn9 (which may be a reduction of pi@, since
these two never co-occur in this construction), while the Inferential I only rarely is.

4.6.2Complement constructionsComplement clauses fill a (semantic) argument slot of a higher complement-taking (CT) predicate head. It is unclear whether complement clauses have grammatical relations with matrix
predicate heads (i.e. function as subjects or objects) as well, or are simply oblique constituents of
some sort. Southern Wakashan has both bare absolute and mood-marked complement clauses.
The essential structural difference between a complement construction and an adverbial construction is that, in the former construction, the roles of the two clauses are not permutable, while,
in the latter construction, they are. That is, only (245)a is grammatical; the complement-taking
word vhj,, vhjH ‘not’ must be the initial, subject-marked, predicate head:

(245) b. *ghrRF`Qhsr vhjH
However, when two clauses are in an adverbial relation, either may be the initial predicate:

(Note that (246)a is the unmarked construction; the variant in (246)b adds emphasis to the identity of the instrument: ‘I chopped it with my axe’.)1554.6.2.1Bare absolute complementsA bare absolute complement clause always follows the matrix clause. An expressed RP subject
can either precede or follow the complement predicate. The subject of the complement predicate
must be co-referential to that of the matrix.

Phasal CT morphemes can impose aspectual requirements on lower predicate heads, e.g. complements to g`vH and Y`BhK` must be imperfective. Complements of other classes of CT roots
are apparently aspectually independent. Note that F`mh pi`x`BHjl`s`jp` ‘that it was probably

difference between them more or less corresponding to the difference between actual (or realis)
and potential (or irrealis) modalities. In Nuuchahnulth, Subordinate complements are often introduced by the subordinate modal particle F`mh ‘that; because’, and Conditional complements by
Ftxh, in origin a derived word meaning ‘at so-and-so time’ but now essentially grammaticalized
(in this construction, at least) as a temporal-conditional complementizer. Makah does not have
F`mh. It is not known whether the Makah analogue of the Nuuchahnulth temporal-conditional
complementizer (Ftxt) occurs with Conditional complements, but it seems likely.

5.1 Formal structure
According to a traditional morphological classification of languages,67 Southern Wakashan is a
classic example of a language family with polysynthetic word structure. Though definitions vary,
a major criterion for polysynthetic status in most accounts is a high average number of morphemes per word. An important corollary is that a significant portion of these must be “lexical”,
rather than grammatical in nature; that is, they should have meanings typically expressed by independent lexical items in other languages. These morphemes might include incorporated nouns
and adverbs, or semantically rich affixes like locative suffixes. Such features permit polysynthetic
languages to have words with complex internal structure that often correspond semantically to
entire sentences in less morphologically elaborate languages.68 True to type, words in Southern
Wakashan can be internally complex with numerous morphemes and multiple hierarchic levels of
structure packed into a single derivative.69
Southern Wakashan word structure can be described by the diagram in Figure 2, a more
detailed version of Figure 1 given previously in Chapter 4.70 The major structural division falls
between the unextended word (base + suffixes) and the extended word level (unextended word +
clitics). Important formal differences exist between the two. The sequence of clitics has templatelike organization with a fixed number of slots, flat structure, strict requirements on linear order of
Figure 2. Word structure

in principle to the number of suffixes that can be added to a base, and the order of suffixes can
often be changed to produce changes in meaning, as demonstrated by the following example set
from Swadesh (1939: 86):
(254)NUUCHAHNULTHa. QtXHrbjih

herring–consume–remains.of‘left-overs from eating herring’
(254) b. QtrbjihYhr
QtrÊbjihÊpÊ""Hr
herring–remains.of–BFR–consume‘eating left-overs of herring’
This open-ended “stacking” of suffixes creates layered structure rather than flat, slot-based structure with a fixed number of affix positions. The remainder of this section describes these formal
aspects of unextended word structure further. Use of clitics has been briefly described in §4.3 and
is more fully covered in Chapter 7.
An unextended word is formed by a base plus (core) lexical suffixes plus aspectual morphemes. (Expanded unextended words and the core/peripheral suffix distinction are discussed
below.) Words can have aspectual value with no overt aspectual formative if their final morpheme (root or lexical suffix) has inherent aspectual force. Anticipating more detailed discussion
of suffix types in §5.3, we find two basic types of lexical suffix: nuclear suffixes (nominalizing,
verbalizing suffixes, etc.), which determine the word class of the resultant word (§5.4), and restrictive suffixes, which merely modify the meaning of the base without necessarily altering its
word class (§5.5). From these definitions we derive two principles of Southern Wakashan word
formation:
i. The category of a nuclear suffix becomes the category of the resultant word.71
ii. Restrictive suffixes do not necessarily determine the category of the resultant word.","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"5.7 Etymological relations between lexical suffixes and roots
Lexical suffixes are at least very rare cross-linguistically and clearly very different semantically
than affixes in familiar languages.83 Despite their root-like meanings, very few show any phonological relationship to a root from which one might hypothesize they are historically derived.
Swadesh (1939: 79) points out two lexical suffixes with both obvious phonological and semantic
similarity to an extant root: the path suffix N ,l`K,, M ,a`K, ‘moving about’ with root N l`K,
‘move’, M a`K`s, ‘(large object) tremble, shake’, and the verbalizing suffix N, M -v@(K) ‘say ...’
with root N, M v@ ‘say’. We might also compare the root N FHpG, ‘tell, narrate’ (probably reduced from earlier *Fhx`pG,) to the verbalizing suffix N ,hx`pG [R] ‘sing ... song’, or, in Kyuquot dialect, ‘tell ... story’ (Rose 1981: 356). A final example involves the primitive root element
N, M vh, that occurs as a component of various roots expressing negative concepts, e.g. N vhj,
M vhjH ‘not’, N vHX`, M vHx` ‘never’, M vHa` ‘not know, recognize a person’, N vhF`ji
‘invulnerable, unafraid’, N, M vH,p, ‘angry, unpleasant; stormy, bad (weather)’, and many others.84 This element evidently occurs as a suffix in a single Nuuchahnulth derivative, rtvHX`j
‘instrument for not holding, nothing to hold’ (< rt, ‘hold’ + ,vH + ,X`ji ‘... instrument’)
(Swadesh 1933: 154). These root/suffix pairs exhaust readily detectable examples. More typical
is the situation shown in (319): roots with semantically similar suffixes are not phonologically
related to them:
(319)RootLexical SuffixN O`OH, M OhOhFH ‘ear’N ,""hlK, M ,""`ahK‘at the ear’N p`rH, M p`khFH ‘eye’N ,(b)rt(K), M ,(j)rhK‘at, in the eye’214N StGBhsh, M StWTBhc` ‘head’ N ,`xtj, M ,dxtj‘at the head, hair’N ,(v)h9ji‘on the head’N ,(b)rhmxtj‘on the head’N ,vhGs`‘at the head’Many body parts are not even coded by roots. If they must be referred to, the corresponding
body-part locative suffix is affixed to a dummy root, either the empty root N ghs`, ghm`, ghm,, M
ghs`, ghc`, or the general locative root N F`l,, M F`u, F`a, e.g.
(320)N F`F`l`r‘(on) the cheeks’ (,`r [R] ‘at the cheeks’)M F`F`a`c`phK ‘(at) the midriff’ (,`c`phK [R] ‘at the midriff’)
N ghm`jrtK‘(at) the mouth, lips’ (,`jrt(K) ‘at the mouth, lips’)M ghs`ptK‘(at) the face’ (,(p)T(K) ‘at the face’)5.8 Specialization
Derived words vary widely in spontaneity of composition and degree of lexicalization. Speakers
are capable of using the principles of derivation we have discussed in this chapter to spontaneously produce and interpret new words, but many derived words must be considered elements of
the permanent mental lexicon, that is, words that are learned as units by speakers during the
course of language acquisition and not derived anew for each use. The clearest indication of this
is specialization of meaning. Derived words frequently have meanings more specific than the
meanings of their component parts would suggest. Examples are legion. The Nuuchahnulth word
FHGsTo (FHGi ‘big’ + ,(R)sTo ‘... species’) literally means ‘big sort, species of thing’ but now
denotes only ‘whale’. The literal force of the component morphemes (‘big’ and ‘... species’) has
been lost, as shown by the fact that one can say ‘big whale’ by modifying the derived word with
one of its own components: FHG FHGsTo ‘a big whale’ (NA 149.47). Similarly, N bhY`r (bhp,
‘speak’ + -""`r ‘go in order to ...’) literally means ‘go in order to speak’, but it is now specialized215to refer to a formal marriage party made up of the groom’s relatives going to the prospective
bride’s people to discuss the proposal in certain ritualized ways. Derived words with specialized
meanings are commonly used for names of flora and fauna, tools, ceremonies, personal names,
and place names, e.g.

Sometimes both the specialized and literal meanings of a word are available. The root N, M

two senses are even used together in the same phrase at NA 165.43: B`F`jFh B`F`j ‘the flowing

"1264.4.3.2Nominal predicatesNominal predicate heads in Southern Wakashan occur in three construction types: class-inclusion
predicates, equational constructions, and existential constructions.
Class-inclusion predicates
In Makah and Nuuchahnulth, nominals may function directly as predicate heads with no intervening copular element.52 They take predicate clitics exactly as verbal predicates do: there are no restrictions on the predicate clitics they may occur with. The words in (205)-(206) show Makah
nouns and property words as heads of class-inclusion predicates; that is, predicates denoting a
class of entities the subject is asserted to be a member of.53 Example (207) shows an intransitive
verbal predicate for comparison. The coding of each clause type is identical: the mood and pronominal clitics are attached directly to the predicate head in all cases. (Only the masculine singular gloss is given for the third person examples for sake of economy.)

the past tense noun, property, and verbal predicates in (208).54 Polar Interrogative mood is used
in these examples instead of Indicative mood for sake of variety, and also to further illustrate the
ability of nominal words to occur with mood and subject clitics. Only second person singular127forms are given, the possibility of nominal predicates occurring with all persons being amply
demonstrated by (205) and (206). Second person singular is zero-marked with this mood in
Makah (§7.2.1)

The homogeneity of coding across word classes demonstrated for mood-marked predicates in
(205)-(208) extends to absolute predicates as well. Examples (209)a-c show a noun, a property
word, and an intransitive verb as bare absolute predicates in complements to the negative root
vhjH.

work128A nominal predicate head may be complex, consisting of a string of nominal words (e.g. a
property + noun, a quantifier + noun, etc.). The words in a multi-word nominal predicate head are
usually strictly ordered: quantifier/numeral > property > noun. Clitics must occur on the first
word of the head. Example (210) shows two multi-word nominal predicates; the predicated expression in (210)a is M FhFHWi PhcHQ ‘big dog’ and, in (210)b, it is N QtK g`Ftl ‘good food’.
Note the position of the predicate modifier XTpi@ ‘likewise’ following g`Ftl in (210)b; its
location is evidence that the string QtKF`Q g`Ftl is indeed a unitary predicate head, since, as
described in §4.3.4, post-head predicate modifiers usually directly follow the predicate head and
precede core arguments.

Equational clauses
Within the major clause types in a language one often finds subtypes with different coding properties that vary according to the semantic or grammatical properties of the lexical items functioning in predicates (e.g. transitive and intransitive subtypes of verbal predication), or according to
different functional predication types possible with expressions headed by the same word class.
An important distinction of the latter sort among nominal predicates is between clauses with
class-inclusion predicates (called “true nominal predicates” by Dryer [to appear]) and those with
equational predicates. In a (declarative) class-inclusion clause the subject is asserted to be a
member of the class of entities denoted by the predicate, e.g. John is a teacher. An equational129clause, on the other hand, asserts that the individual denoted by the predicate is the same as the
individual denoted by the subject, i.e. the latter is equated with the former, e.g. John is the
teacher. In English, the two types are distinguished in several ways (Lyons 1977: 471-72, Dryer
[to appear]). The examples in the previous section are of the class-inclusion type, e.g. (205)a M
vhjvHx@jr ‘I am a boy’. We see from those examples that class-inclusion clauses in Southern
Wakashan have the nominal expression as the (syntactic) predicate head. Clauses with equational
predicates are formed at least two ways. The first, and less preferred, way, only attested in Nuuchahnulth, is to use the same construction found in class-inclusion clauses: the entity to which the
subject is equated serves as predicate head with the appropriate predicate clitics attached:
(211)NUUCHAHNULTHG`VhKl`
G`VhK<l@ghK
ghKchief=INDICtherewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww‘He is the chief there.’ (based on NA 47.2)
Although the translation of (211) in the source and its discourse context make clear that it is to be
taken as equational, out of context it is presumably ambiguous between class-inclusion and equational readings, i.e. out of context (211) could also mean ‘He is a chief (i.e. high ranking male)
there’. (The usual English gloss for G`VhK, ‘chief’, is misleading because it implies unique status
for its referent in a group. The word actually refers to any high-ranking male, so a group can have
more than one G`VhK –– the class-inclusion reading is perfectly plausible, and, as we see next, is
probably preferred.)
The second, and more common, construction involves pronouns interposed as copular elements. This is in fact the only possible construction if the (semantic) predicate is a personal name,
place name, an RP with the article, or, in Makah, an RP with a possessive clitic, because these
types of nominal expressions cannot normally function as syntactic predicate heads:55130(212)MAKAHa. *BillFh

*gtWs`jÊr`9pÊshFh9<?hp<?h
*know.how–CAUS.PERF–...er=ART=INDICBill
Bill
Bill*‘Bill is the teacher.’
(The prohibition against co-occurrence of mood clitics and the article will be shown to be natural
when I suggest in §4.5.1 that the article itself is a mood clitic.)
The precise form of the correct construction in Nuuchahnulth depends on the person of the
subject, which is the entity on X-side of the semantic equational schema. If it is first or second
person, the predicative form of the appropriate independent pronoun intervenes as predicate head,
and the entity on the Y-side of the equational schema is simply syntactically apposed to it:56

(213) b. rhX@p`G
m`omHsFh
rhX@p<(l)@<`G m`omHs<FH
1sg.PRED=INDIC=1sgpriest=ART‘I am the priest.’
The literal force of this construction appears to be ‘I am I (who am) Niinispatwas’, with the name
or RP-with-article as an “appositional complement” to the predicate. This is supported by the fact
that the very same construction translates as ‘It it I, NAME’.

These predicative pronoun forms otherwise appear only in subject focus constructions like (215),
which suggests that equational predication is treated as a pragmatically marked discourse type.

If the subject is third person, the deictic pronoun FtG ‘this one, that one, so-and-so, such-andsuch’ fills the syntactic predicate head slot with the X as its subject and the Y as antecedent to
FtG. The construction literally means something like ‘He is so-and-so (who is) Bill’ or ‘Bill is
that one (who is) the priest’. Note in (216)c that the Y has been moved before the predicate head,
while in (216)d it is the X that has been fronted.

Nuuchahnulth also has directional imperatives that mean ‘come and ...!’ or ‘go and ...!’.
These are laid out in Table 22 (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 243).

Finally, a structural note. As we have seen, the pronominal marking in the clitic sequence
usually expresses the person and number (in first and second person) of the subject. In Imperative
moods, however, first person objects are indexed with a pronominal clitic. In bare absolute complement constructions the mood and pronominal clitics occur on the matrix predicate (§4.6.2.1).
This means the first person object of a transitive bare absolute complement predicate is actually
marked on the matrix predicate instead of the complement in an Imperative mood.

7.2.21 The articles
The article M <?hp, N <FH (and its evidential-quotative counterpart N <(l)hE` ~ <E@) normally attaches to the first non-demonstrative word of the RP.105 It has multiple functions. The
most basic is simply to mark referring phrases as such. It occurs optionally with RPs containing a
noun or quantifier, but obligatorily with RPs that do not contain a word from one of these classes.
In cases where it is optional, its appearance seems to be conditioned by some functional parameter akin to definiteness. Sapir (1924: 84, note 9) calls <FH a “suffixed definite article, often used
as nominalizing element”, Swadesh (1948: 109) calls it a “definite suffix”, and Rose (1981: 250-29853) describes it as a definite and particularizing marker. Jacobsen (1973: 21) says the Makah article “indicates a certain definiteness of reference”. It is true that RPs whose referents are definite
(in the sense of identifiable) and particular (specific and referential) almost always have an article, sometimes in concert with the preceding demonstrative particle, x@ in Nuuchahnulth106 or sH
‘this’, WT ‘that’ and related forms in Makah.107 For example, the referents of N pTF`rFh ‘the
man’ in (443)a and N x@ pTF`rFh ‘the man’ in (443)b are introduced in preceding sentences of
their respective texts (Text 13 and Text 76) and are thus identifiable and particular.

However, definiteness and particularity cannot be the whole story, as shown by the two RPs in
example (444), which is the first sentence of Text 16.

FtÊm@ji<vDFhmG@ji@Q pTF`rFh
G@ji@Q pTF`r<FHso.and.so–have=QUOTgirlperson=ART‘A certain man had a daughter.’ (NT 68.22)
This sentence introduces the referents of both RPs into the text for the first time, which means
they ostensibly have the same identifiability status (unidentifiable), and both are particular, yet
the subject RP has an article and the object RP does not.
In general, RPs that depart from the narrow identifiable-and-particular type in (443) (e.g. RPs
with unidentifiable referents, non-referential expressions, generic RPs, etc.), show complex patterns of article use that are not well understood and that may not be reducible to a single general
principle. Consider the RPs in (445). These sentences come from a passage in which the speaker299is describing his attempt to build a big house, a project which first requires finding appropriately
large cedar logs. Sentence (445)a occurs two paragraphs before (445)b.

The pattern of the article use in these sentences is further evidence against the definiteness-andparticularity hypothesis in its simplest form. Neither of the referents is identifiable, and the object
RP in (445)a, QtjiHsFh GtlHr ‘stout cedar logs’, which has the article, is non-referential –– the
speaker is looking for any objects that satisfy the intension of the RP rather than some specific
subset of stout cedar logs. In fact, that may be exactly the point: the article in (445)a may indicate
that the speaker is looking for “the whole set” in the sense that any member of the set of cedar
logs that are stout will do, while the lack of article in (445)b indicates he did not find the entire
set of good cedars, just some non-specific subset.
It is probably the case that the article is sensitive to discourse-pragmatic factors like topicality
and communicative importance in addition to –– or instead of –– definiteness or particularity/specificity strictly defined. Other criteria, as yet undiscovered, may also be relevant. As Rose
(1981) suggests, it may be necessary to take into account other elements that are present in an RP,
and if so, their categories. Further study of how the article is used in discourse is the only sure
way of making progress on these questions.

8.1 Inventory
Southern Wakashan has at least the following classes of unextended words (§4.2.1).
(491)Nominals
Nouns (§8.2.1)
Numerals, quantities, and quantifiers (§8.2.2)
Pronouns (§8.2.3)
Verbs (§8.3)
Predicate modifiers (§8.4)This list does not include particles, that is, words with limited capacity for taking lexical suffixes
or clitics and no implication of aspect. The class of particles includes imperative particles, interjections, and syntactic particles. See Swadesh (1933: 20-23, 1939: 80-81) for more information.114
The degree of grammatical differentiation among word classes in Southern Wakashan is famously low.115 Words are sometimes said to be polyfunctional (e.g. Rose 1981: 10, who, referring
to Kyuquot, speaks of “the extreme degree of constituent multipurposeness of lexical entries”),
but according to the conception of Southern Wakashan syntax developed in Chapter 4, this characterization is a bit misleading. Referring phrases (RPs), the syntactic realization of referring expressions, are claimed to be headless relative clauses or “nominalized” clauses, where “nominal”
is understood to mean “referring expression”.116 This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that all full
words (except proper names) are predicative, as Swadesh (1933, 1939) proposed early on. Hence,
the difference between (common) nouns and verbs is not in their ability to function in different
grammatical roles, for there is only one major syntactic role in Southern Wakashan, predicate325head, but rather in the ease with which clauses headed by them can function as clauses that refer,
referring phrases, which fill the syntactic roles of subject, object, and oblique.
Based on this insight, first expressed by Jacobsen (1979a) in somewhat different terms, we
can say more precisely that clauses with verbal predicates cannot function as RPs unless they also
have an expressed nominal subject or are marked by the enclitic article M <?hp, N <FH, or both.
Thus, the second and third words in (492)a, a verbal predicate and its object, cannot be interpreted as belonging to an RP that functions as subject of ghwi@F`k ‘he/she is working hard’. This
proposition would have to be expressed by (492)b, which includes the article:
(492)*MAKAHa. *ghwi@F`k

*working.hard=TEMP=INDIC.3sgEhQHEHx

g`Fta wwwwww
EhÊ(x)` [RepR]<?hp g`Fta`
cut–REP=ART
food wwwwwwwwwwwwwwww‘The one, a certain one who is cutting food, is working hard.’
Note, however, that (492)a could mean ‘he/she is working hard cutting fish’.
It may well be, as argued by Nakayama (1997a), that good functional motivations exist for
this structural pattern, but since it defines distributional classes, there seems no reason not to call
words in the resulting classes “nouns” and “verbs”.117 I claim that the essential difference between Southern Wakashan and a language like Latin is one of degree, not of kind: it is not that
Latin has nouns and verbs and Southern Wakashan does not, but that the degree of grammaticalization of the classes is much greater in Latin than in Southern Wakashan.
The three nominal subclasses (noun, numeral/quantifier, pronoun) are distinguished by formal criteria discussed in the relevant sections below. Such formal differences are again slight.
Predicate modifiers are distinguished from verbs by their lack of ability to function as predicate heads and by the pattern of clitic placement in predicates containing them (§8.4).","[338, 339, 340, 341]"

Example (168) contains the possessive clitic <F`ji, which here indicates that the grammatical
subject is the possessor of the single argument of the intransitive predicate head (S) cTvhprt
‘father’; the possessed S argument is syntactically an oblique. The first person possessor in (168)
is hence the subject and the second person participant, the S of cTvhprt ‘(be) father’, is oblique.
Significantly, the same Indicative pronominal clitic is used as in the preceding first person singular acting on second person singular transitive example (167).

Eschewing the details, arguments can be given to show that (168) is, in fact, intransitive; that is,
we are not dealing with a transitive construction like ‘you (are) father (to) me’.
In Nuuchahnulth, the first word in a mood-marked predicate hosts a mood clitic followed directly by a pronominal clitic that expresses the person and number of the subject:
(169)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Q`G
mtmTj<""`Q<(l)@<`G
sing=TEMP=INDIC=1sg‘I am singing.’
Third person, however, is unmarked by a pronominal clitic –– the absence of a pronominal clitic
indicates third person. In some cases the mood clitic shows slight formal peculiarities when not
followed by a first or second person clitic that could be said to mark third person, but third person
has no clitic of its own:102(170)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Ql`
mtmTj<""`Q<l@
sing=TEMP=INDIC‘He/she/it/they are singing.’
The Nuuchahnulth pronominal subject clitics fall into several sets of forms depending on the preceding mood clitic (§7.2.2), e.g. the Indicative mood clitic in (169) and (170) <(l)@ (or <l@
with no following pronominal clitic) is followed by a set in which first person singular is indicated by <`G.
Unlike Makah, Nuuchahnulth does not mark non-subjects in the clitic sequence under most
circumstances. However, first person non-subjects are marked in imperative moods (§7.2.20),
and, very rarely, in the Indicative (§7.2.4).
Southern Wakashan mood clitics express a varied set of modal, evidential, and speech-act
categories. Most of these are in paradigmatic opposition, but a few may co-occur to form mood
combinations (§7.2.3). Mood clitics include the Indicative illustrated above for both languages,
the Purposive M, N <""`9 ‘in order that’, interrogative moods used to form both yes/no and content questions, the Conditional M <pdx(t), N <pt9 ‘if, when; would’, the Nuuchahnulth Dubitative <p@E` ‘perhaps’, and the Subordinate M <W, <p`9, N <p@, which forms that-clause
complements of predicates of saying, thinking, etc. as well as causal (‘because’) clauses, and, in
Makah, ‘when’ clauses (in conjunction with Ftxt ‘when’). There are also several evidential
moods in both languages, including the Quotative M <v`9s, <v`9c`, N <vDFhm and inferential moods. The Makah Relative <(p)hj, <(p)h and Nuuchahnulth Definite Relative <FHsp and
Indefinite Relative <(x)h9 moods form relative clauses. See Chapter 7 for more on the form and
function of these and other mood clitics.
Predicates without mood marking are often called “absolute” or “absolutive” in the Southern
Wakashan descriptive literature (e.g. Sapir 1924: 82, note 1, Rose 1981: 213, Jacobsen 1979a,
1993). It is necessary to recognize two types of absolute predicates: subject-marked absolutes and103non-subject-marked absolutes, which I henceforth refer to as “bare absolutes”. Bare absolutes
occur only as same-subject juxtaposed predicates in the common sentence-building construction
described in §4.5, or as complements of certain complement-taking words (§4.6.2.1). Subjectmarked absolutes typically occur in narrative contexts where the mood has been previously established in the discourse by a preceding mood-marked predicate.
Pronominal subjects in subject-marked absolute predicates are marked on the first word of the
predicate by a set of pronominal clitics, which, in Makah, has no form indicating third person
singular, and, in Nuuchahnulth, has no form indicating third person whatsoever. Bare absolute
predicates (by definition) have no subject marking. This means that a third person subject-marked
absolute is overtly indistinguishable from a bare absolute. For example, in the Makah sentences in
(171), compare the third person singular subject-marked absolute in (171)a with the two predicates in (171)b, the first of which is the third person singular subject-marked absolute matrix
predicate vhJ`Q ‘He/she/it did, were not’, and the second, g`FtjRhQ ‘eat’, a bare absolute functioning as complement to vhJ`Q.

The three predicates are superficially identical with respect to subject marking. However, it is
easy enough to tell them apart as long as we keep in mind the structural difference between a zero
form and nothing, that is, a form where a decision between paradigmatic options has resulted in a
marker that happens to be zero versus a form in which no marking can ever occur. This distinction clearly emerges when the sentences are put in first person:104(172)MAKAHa. g`FtjRF`Qrh

eat–PERF=TEMP=1sg‘I ate.’
(172) b vhJ`Qrh

vhj<""`Q<rh9 [g`FtjÊRhQ]
not=TEMP=1sg[eat–PERF]‘I didn’t eat.’
(172) c. )vhJ`Qrh [g`FtjRhQrH]
The subject-marked absolute predicates in (172)a-b are now marked with the first person singular
clitic <rh9. The bare absolute complement to vhJ`Qrh in (172)b remains without the subject clitic, and, as (172)c shows, the sentence becomes ungrammatical (with this meaning) if it is added.
(172)c is a grammatical string, but only if it is interpreted as two successive subject-marked absolutes (‘I didn’t do it; I ate’), where the speaker asserts that he did eat, but didn’t do something
else. In this dissertation, predicates in constructed sentence examples are usually marked with
Indicative mood (the unmarked mood for conversation), but examples cited from texts are frequently subject-marked absolutes. See, for example, (176)e-f, (178)b, (179)c etc. below. Presented with a subject-marked absolute out of context, Makah speakers typically “correct” it to a
mood-marked predicate.
4.3.2TenseSentences with no overt tense marking are, strictly speaking, non-future, that is, they are interpreted as having either past or present time reference, according to context. Non-tense-marked
predicates in isolated elicitation sentences are invariably interpreted as having present time reference in Makah (unless they are perfective –– see below), and I suspect in Nuuchahnulth also. In
both languages, however, one frequently finds non-tense-marked predicates with past time reference in narrative discourse. Past and future tense clitics in the predicate indicate time reference105relative to that already established in the discourse. For example, the past tense clitic M <(a)hs,
N <(l)hs is a relative past marker in that it indicates time reference prior to the discourseestablished time reference rather than absolute past time reference.
(173)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Qhsrh
mtmTj<""`Q<(l)hs<rH
sing=TEMP=PAST=1sg‘I was, had been singing.’
It is worth pointing out here that tense and aspect are entirely distinct formal systems in Southern
Wakashan. Tense is marked by clitics, while aspect is marked by suffixes, reduplication, or length
changes in base vowels (§4.2.3). However, past temporal reference is strongly implied by perfective aspect, which is usually incompatible with present reference (§6.4). See, for example, the
past tense translations of the sentences in (171) and (172).
The temporal specifier M, N <""`Q is another predicate clitic implicated in temporal reckoning. It precedes tense, mood and pronominal clitics in the clitic sequence. The temporal specifier
is not a tense marker, but is used to indicate temporal sequencing of events and states. It is usually
left untranslated, but can be rendered ‘now, then, at that time’ if necessary. The temporal specifier
is grammatically optional, but is stylistically important and very frequent in discourse. See §7.3.3
for further information.
4.3.3Other cliticsThus far we have seen clitics expressing mood, pronominals, and tense. These belong to a larger
set of clitics that may occur in the predicate. When more than one occurs on the same word in the
predicate, they are strictly ordered. Although the order differs somewhat for the two languages,
clitics in both may be divided into three groups based on their sequencing requirements: premodal clitics, mood and pronominal clitics, and post-modal clitics. Pre-modal clitics precede
mood clitics. Among them we find the following (only a single allomorph of each is shown):106(174)Selected pre-modal cliticsIntentive Future: N <F`9pQ (§7.3.2)
Causative: M, N <""`o
Temporal Specifier (‘now, then, at that time’): M, N <""`Q (§7.3.3)
Passive-inverse: M <""hs, N <""`s (§4.4.2, §7.3.5)
Possessive: M, N <tj (§7.3.4)
Tense: including past M<(a)hs, N <(l)hs and hypothetical future M <""dxhj, N <""h9j
Co-occurrence restrictions and relative ordering of these clitics are discussed at §7.5. Some of
the clitics in (174) are briefly discussed elsewhere in this chapter, e.g. see §4.4.2 for the passiveinverse.
Post-modal clitics follow mood and pronominal clitics.
(175)Selected post-modal cliticsThird plural (optionally signals third person plural participant): M <`K, N<F`K (§7.4.1)
Habitual: M <`9j, N <F`9K` (§7.4.2)
‘again’: M <QFn, N <Q`9 (§7.4.4)
4.3.4Predicate modifiersThe basic predicate structure of head and clitics in the examples seen so far in this section may be
expanded by the addition of one or two predicate modifiers. Predicate modifiers are a small
closed-class of words like N F`GF@ ‘then’, M F@ch, N F@mh ‘really, in fact’, M xTxT, N C@mh
‘at first, for a while, temporarily’, N FHpGH ‘still’, M gTF`Wh ‘still, yet’, M jTvhK, N jtVhK`
‘doing as directed’, N v@Q ‘now, then, thereupon’, and M xTpi@, N XTpi@ ‘likewise’. A few
words from other word classes can also play this syntactic role, e.g. M FhFHWi`, N FHGi ‘big’
also occurs as as a predicate modifier meaning ‘really, very much, to a great extent’.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122]"
"6.2 The character of aspect in Southern Wakashan
At least from Sapir (1924), researchers on Southern Wakashan have recognized a basic two-way
semantic aspectual distinction. As we will see below, I claim with Rose (1981) that the distinction
is between imperfective and perfective aspect, but the two categories were originally labeled
“durative” and “momentaneous” by Sapir and Swadesh in Nuuchahnulth. This analysis is explicitly stated in places,87 but, even where not claimed outright in their works, it is often implied.88
Swadesh & Swadesh (1933: 199) give a representative characterization of the meanings of the
durative and momentaneous categories (as originally conceived) in Ditidaht:89
The durative expresses a continued existence, state, or activity; thus duratives are
translatable by English nouns, adjectives, and verbs expressing states and continued activities. The momentaneous expresses momentary occurrences, including
transitions into states and states of activity (these are generally translated “to start
doing ...”).
They evidently see the aspectual distinction as deriving from the duration of the situation itself: a
situation that lasts a relatively long time (“a continued existence, state, or activity”) is expressed
by the durative, and, conversely, a situation that lasts a very short time (a “momentary occurrence”) is expressed by the momentaneous. An aspectual distinction of this type is a situationtype distinction, because it involves some feature of the intrinsic temporal structure of the situation as represented by the semantics of the language. Different situation-type aspects correspond
to different semantic situation types.
A problem arises immediately with a situation-type definition of the two aspects based on
duration: the “momentaneous” is not limited to expressing momentary situations. It does express219situations that are truly instantaneous, as the suffix M, N ,RhQ in (323)a does, but it can just as
easily refer to a situation that might last minutes (323)b or days (323)c.

go.home–?=TEMP=1sg‘I went home.’ (NT 150.16; context: the speaker travels home to the west coast of
Vancouver Island from Vancouver after visiting various tribes to invite them to his
daughter’s puberty potlatch)
It is difficult to see how the duration of the situations could be the primary factor in the choice of
aspect in these examples.
On the contrary, the point of using ,RhQ in (323) is not to express some intrinsic characteristic
of the situations (like momentary duration), but to present a particular view of them relative to
other situations in the flow of discourse, whatever their intrinsic structure might be. This is “extrinsic” or viewpoint (Smith 1996) aspect, a “temporal restriction on what is asserted” (Klein
1995: 690).90 Here the basic distinction is between perfective and imperfective aspects. Following
the spirit (though not necessarily the letter) of Klein’s (1995) “time-relational” analysis of aspect,
the difference between perfective and imperfective can be thought of as a difference in the scope
of assertion relative to internal situation boundaries. As I interpret this with respect to Southern
Wakashan, viewpoint aspect does not express durativity or lack thereof (as situation-type aspect
would), but rather, by selection of one (viewpoint) aspect over another, a speaker elects to include
or exclude any phases or boundaries that already exist in the meaning of a base. For example, in220(323)c, by choosing ,RhQ, which we now reinterpret as a perfective suffix, the speaker includes all
phases of the situation in his assertion, and thus in effect presents it as a completed whole relative
to other situations in the discourse context. The following Nuuchahnulth text excerpt (from Text
39) shows example (323)c in situ, with its immediately preceding and following sentences.

The three situations are presented as temporally sequenced, independent, and completed events,
like beads on a string:
[event 1] ‘they said’ [event 2] ‘I went home’ [event 3] ‘I arrived’
On the other hand, when an imperfective aspect is applied to v`K-,, all internal situation
boundaries are not included in the assertion, allowing the situation of going home to be interpreted as ongoing and overlapping another situation. Example (324) has v`K-, with the
graduative imperfective aspect (§6.5.1), an aspect used for secondary imperfectivization (i.e. to
imperfectivize an already perfective form), as a bare absolute predicate head following the inherently imperfective sHC ‘alive’. Because, as imperfectives, neither (v@KRhQ or sHC) has its situation boundaries included in the assertion, they can be construed as simultaneous.","[234, 235, 236]"

Sapir (1924), Swadesh (1933: 16-17), Swadesh (1939: 82), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242-43),
Swadesh (1948a), and Haas (1969).100 The analysis contained herein is along the lines suggested
by Sapir (1924), although the Indicative paradigm listed by Sapir (1924: 82, note 1) does not
segment the modal formative from the pronominal endings.
Nuuchahnulth presents fewer complications than Makah with regard to mood and pronominal
marking. To begin with, in most moods Nuuchahnulth pronominal clitics index only subjects.
Second, there is less variation in the shapes of mood clitics and in the pronominal subject clitics.
Third, in the present analysis, third person is unmarked (except, occasionally, by an irregularity in
the form of the mood clitic when it is not followed by a first or second person clitic). A third person plural subject or object can optionally be marked with the third plural clitic <F`K (§7.4.1).
Nuuchahnulth subject clitics fall into four sets based on the mood clitics they occur with
(Table 17). (These four sets are not to be taken as etymologically equivalent to the four Makah
sets in Table 15, although, many of the individual formatives are undoubtedly at least partially
cognate.) Set 1 occurs with the Indicative and Purposive clitics. Set 2a occurs in absolute predicates and with the Quotative. Set 2b occurs with most of the other mood clitics: Interrogative,

the Inferential II and Dubitative moods. The Assertive apparently mixes Set 1 and Set 2 forms.
The Nuuchahnulth mood clitics are listed in Table 18. Hyphens indicate a few probable
boundaries between etymologically distinct modal formatives. I have mostly retained the mood
names as given in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 242) except their “Relative” mood has been renamed
“Definite Relative”. The Inferential I and Assertive moods, not included by them, have been
added based on my study of the texts.101 Their names are my own invention. My “Assertive”
mood corresponds to Rose (1981) and Nakayama’s (1997a) “indicative” in Kyuquot and
Ahousaht dialects. See §7.2.19. One of Sapir and Swadesh’s moods, the Relative Dubitative, has

<FHRMood combinations and other modal formativesThe mood clitics are mutually exclusive with one exception in Nuuchahnulth: the Quotative can
combine with some of the other moods. It co-occurs at least with the Conditional, the Subordinate, the Inferential II, and the Dubitative. The Conditional and Subordinate precede the Quotative, while the two evidential moods, the Inferential II and Dubitative, follow it, e.g.
COND=QUOT:<pt9vdFhm (but occasionally QUOT=COND, <vDFhmpt9)SUBOR=QUOT:<GvDFhmQUOT=DUB:<vDFhmp`E`QUOT=INFERII:<vDFhmE`Y`R267Examples of these Quotative combinations will be given below in the sections on the relevant
non-Quotative moods.
Several other modal formatives are in use in Makah and Nuuchahnulth, but these never occur
without the presence a mood clitic from Table 18.102 These additional formatives are as follows:
M <(n9)vhr, N <(v)t9r dubitative, precedes at least the M, N Indicative, N Subordinate, M
Relative, N Indefinite Relative, N Inferential II, and N Dubitative. Other combinations
may be possible. The dubitative expresses the possibility that an event might occur or
doubt as to whether it will occur.
M <oh9s evidential, occurs with the Indicative.103
N <C quotative/evidential, occurs with the Conditional, Interrogative, Indefinite Relative, and
perhaps Subordinate. It is inserted between the mood clitic and the pronominal clitic, e.g.
the second person singular quotative Indefinite Relative is <(x)h9<C<j. This formative
is probably also an etymological component of the Inferential I & II and Dubitative mood
clitics.
N <F@ follows the Interrogative to form negative biased questions: ‘Is he? (of course not)’
(Swadesh 1939: 83).
N <pn9 follows the Subordinate (rarely) and Inferential II (commonly) to express unanticipated
result: ‘as it turned out’.
See below for examples of these formatives in use.

Objects in Nuuchahnulth are not normally marked in the clitic sequence. One exception is
found with Imperative moods, which I discuss at §7.2.20. In the ceremonial language of speeches,
one also occasionally finds forms for second person singular subject acting on first person singular object that occur only with the Indicative, <(l)@<Fhb`r, transparently formed from the
regular second singular plus ,`r:

This is obviously reminiscent of the regular Makah Indicative second singular on first singular
form. Approximate Makah counterparts of (374)a and (374)b would be (375)a and (375)b, respectively.

Its formation is apparently similar to the Purposive in Nuuchahnulth: clitic <""`9 plus Set 1 (Indicative) pronominals.
7.2.6QuotativeThe Quotative indicates that a statement is based on hearsay evidence rather than the direct experience of the speaker. The person reference cross-references the person of the subject, not the
speaker.

Subordinate §7.2.7, Inferential I §7.2.9, Inferential II §7.2.17, and Dubitative §7.2.18 moods.
7.2.7SubordinateThe Subordinate is used most often in realis complement clauses following predicates of perceiving, saying, thinking, and feeling. In Nuuchahnulth, such clauses are frequently preceded by the
subordinating particle F`mh.

Two second person plural clitics take longer forms in Makah when directly followed by the
habitual clitic. I have not reelicited this material, so my description relies on Jacobsen’s (1973:
16-17) presentation of the data; he refers to this morpheme as the “usitative”. The Set 1 (Indicative) second person plural clitic in Table 15 takes the form <?hbn9vhC (instead of <?hb`9) and the
Set 2 form becomes <rn9v`C (instead of <r`9).","[329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334]"

The base, which is here only a noun root, provides more precise specification of the meaning of
the suffix –– it fills out or completes its meaning just as the object NP does for the English preposition.
The word in (275)b demonstrates an entirely different grammatical relationship between suffix and base. Unlike ,Ch, the suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ does not determine the class of the resultant word, which remains a noun; it adds information about the base and limits or restricts its denotation, much as an adjective or relative clause limits the denotation of an English noun: the
word’s potential referent is not only a pack-basket, but a pack-basket that is in a container. The
noun p`FTbBt ‘pack-basket in a container’ functions like any other noun. Example (277) shows
it as nominal predicate head in a main clause:

c. ‘He/she/they have a pack-basket in the sack.’
The source of the multiple meanings is described in §4.4.3.2. If the predicate is atransitive
(§4.4.3.1), the clause has the existential reading in (277)a, and the RP mHr@jFh ‘the sack’ is a182locative oblique expanding the reference of ,BT. If the subject is personal, the sentence can mean
either (277)b or (277)c depending on the subject reference: if mHr@jFh is interpreted as the subject, (277)b is the appropriate translation; if it is interpreted as an oblique locative, (277)c is the
appropriate translation. The word might also occur as predicate head in a referring phrase (RP):

referring phrase‘I could not find [the sack with a pack-basket in it].’
This use is related to the possessive-existential meaning in (277)b. The RP literally means something like ‘the sack having a pack-basket in it’.
I refer to suffixes of the ,Ch type as nuclear suffixes. Suffixes like ,BT are restrictive suffixes.77 The essential difference between the nuclear and restrictive types is that a nuclear suffix
determines the class of the resultant word, while a restrictive suffix simply modifies the meaning
of its base without fundamentally altering its semantic category or word class. This can be also
expressed in terms of headedness: a nuclear suffix becomes the head of the resultant word, while
the base remains the head when a restrictive suffix is added.78 There are also the morphological
differences between the two types described in §5.1.
The Nuuchahnulth examples in (279) (from Swadesh 1948b: 62) provide further illustration
of the nuclear/restrictive distinction. Compare the word class and denotation of the words in
(279)a and (279)c with that of the word in (279)b.

The underived word in (279)a, E`o`b ‘canoe’, and the derived word with the restrictive suffix in
(279)c, E`o`b`p ‘large canoe’, are both nouns and refer to the same entity: addition of the restrictive suffix ,(p)`p ‘very; big’ (this time a degree suffix rather than a locative suffix) has not
changed the word class or reference of the resultant word. Addition of the verbalizing suffix
-(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’ in (279)b, on the other hand, changes the category from noun to
verb, and fundamentally alters the relation of subject to predicate.
Boas’s (1947: 237) objection to this classification scheme runs as follows. (The original
quote is rather oddly phrased. I have taken the liberty of including Nakayama’s 1997a: 49 clarificatory emendations in brackets):
We cannot accept the classification of “formative” suffixes in two groups: “governing” and “restrictive” suffixes which are not based on internal evidence, but
rather on our European classifications ... For instance [the morphological complex] “to see a canoe” which [includes a lexical suffix expressing the notion of
“to see” that] would fall under the heading of “governing suffixes” may as well
be conceived as “to perform an action relating to a canoe by seeing” in which
case [the lexical suffix expressing] “to see” would be a restrictive element ... It is
impossible to decide how these combinations may be felt by native speakers.
Formally the governing and restrictive groups are identical.
His point concerning Eurocentric approaches to grammar is well taken, as I have said. In this case
though, contra Boas, the nuclear/restriction distinction is not a product of “European classifications”. The distinction is real and fundamental to Nuuchahnulth word formation. We see better184why his charge is unwarranted if we break it down into three subparts and address them individually. Each makes a slightly differently claim:
1. There is no language internal evidence for the distinction;
2. There is no formal evidence of the distinction;
3. Classifications of individual suffixes as governing [nuclear] or restrictive are artifacts of
translation, as purportedly shown by the ‘see a canoe’ example.
All three of these points can be shown to be false.
The first and second claims are contradicted by patterns like those I presented above, which
show systematic differences in the grammatical and semantic relationships between the two types
of suffixes and their bases. These are certainly language internal and formal (since determination
of word class is based on distributional evidence) –– nuclear suffixes have the power to determine
the class of the resultant word, while restrictive suffixes normally do not. Chapter 8 discusses the
criteria for defining word classes.
As for the third claim, Boas fails to show that the distinction is an artifact of translation because the revised translation of ‘see a canoe’ he proposes to demonstrate this is nothing more than
a convoluted restatement of the original translation. His revision still contains a verb phrase,
namely ‘to perform an action relating to ... by seeing’. Hence, the suffix with this translation
would still produce a verb rather than a noun, which is precisely what is predicted. Further, the
fact that ‘see’ is restrictive in the new translation is irrelevant since it does not modify the right
word. If the suffix were restrictive in the present sense, it would modify the base ‘canoe’ and produce a noun denoting something about a canoe that sees or is seen. Instead, the phrase ‘by seeing’
is an adverbial phrase that modifies the participle construction ‘relating to ...’, which itself modifies the word ‘action’ in the verb phrase ‘perform an action’. As Swadesh (1948b: 62) himself
points out:185Boas says that ‘to see a canoe’ ... may as well be conceived as ‘to perform an action relating to a canoe by seeing.’ But, since the stem alone means ‘canoe,’ this
translation includes for the meaning of the suffix ‘by seeing to perform an action
relating to’ –– which leaves the problem exactly as before ... It is no mere trick of
English translation but an inescapable fact that the relation of subject and stem
remains the same in [(279)a and (279)c] but is radically changed in [(279)b].
Ironically, Boas’ pessimism about gaining insight into native classification leads him to a
wholly translation-based descriptive categorization of suffixes in Kwakwala that is not so far
from the structurally-based scheme adopted for Southern Wakashan in this dissertation (see especially Boas 1947: 237-46). He divides Kwakwala suffixes into 19 categories (some of which contain only one or two suffixes) with labels like “general locatives”, “special locatives”, “nominal
suffixes”, “verbal suffixes”, etc. Based on examples of suffixes he offers from various categories,
it seems likely that at least the locative suffixes and nominal/verbal suffixes (and perhaps suffixes
of the other classes) fall into behaviorally distinguishable super categories comparable to the
Southern Wakashan restrictive and nuclear classes.
I present a provisional summary classification of the various Southern Wakashan nuclear and
restrictive subcategories below. Complete suffix lists can be found in Appendix A. For the most
part these categories have distinct formal properties, which provides some justification for claiming they are reflective of native classification. However, the semantic subdivision of restrictive
locative suffixes in Appendix A (after Rose 1981: 359-61) is simply a convenience to show the
reader the range of meanings expressed by them and is not based on language-internal or formal
criteria.
The proposed classification is not intended as a Procrustean scheme into which all suffixes
must neatly fit. Some fall into more than one category. For example, a handful of suffixes are
sometimes used as restrictive locative suffixes and other times as nuclear verbalizing suffixes
(e.g. N ,bHK ‘(restrictive) on the edge; (nuclear verbalizing) on the ... edge’). These are generally
listed only once in Appendix A, under the category that seems most characteristic.","[196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"

ABSTRACT
Studies in Southern Wakashan (Nootkan) Grammar
by
Matthew DavidsonThis dissertation is a study of Southern Wakashan (Nootkan) grammar using data from two languages, Makah and the Tseshaht dialect of Nuuchahnulth (Nootka). The phonology, morphology,
and syntax of each language are examined with emphasis on structurally important or typologically interesting features. The description of Makah is based mostly on field data collected in
Neah Bay, Washington by the author. Nuuchahnulth data is drawn from Sapir and Swadesh’s two
published text collections on the language (Sapir & Swadesh 1939, 1955).
Chapter One introduces the Southern Wakashan family and describes the nature of the present study, explaining how the dissertation came to be written, the corpus used in the study, and
previous literature on Southern Wakashan. Chapter Two summarizes Southern Wakashan segmental phonology with a presentation of the Nuuchahnulth consonant and vowel inventories, basic allophonic processes, ablaut patterns, and discussion of the special behavior of nasals when
they appear in syllable codas. The accent systems of the two languages are also briefly described
and compared. Chapter Three, Phonological Alternations, describes a variety of alternations triggered by affixation, including glottalization and lenition of final base segments by affixes, alterations to the CV skeleton of bases required by affixes, and, in Makah, widespread patterns of
vowel insertion and loss. Chapter Four is a grammatical sketch of Southern Wakashan divided
into sections on word classes, morphology (word structure, lexical suffixes, and aspect), predicate
structure, basic clause structure (referring phrase functions, constituent order, clause types), referring phrases, and complex constructions. Chapter Five examines the recursive polysynthetic word
structure more closely. Chapter Six presents the aspect system. Chapter Seven, Clitics, describesxviimood and pronominal clitics, as well as other clitics associated with predicates. Chapter Eight
argues that, although word classes are very weakly grammaticalized in Makah and Nuuchahnulth,
distributional evidence is available for distinguishing nouns (and other nominal subcategories)
from verbs. It goes on to show many examples of nominals and verbs in each of their possible
syntactic contexts. Lists of lexical suffixes in Makah and Nuuchahnulth and selected Makah vocabulary are provided in two appendices.","[14, 15, 16]"

As a rule, however, simple RPs are less complex than main clauses; referring expressions requiring overt subject and/or object RPs are often expressed by apposed simple RPs (231), or else by a
root RP containing a relative root like x`pi ‘one who, that which’ (for which see §4.5.2 below).

The bracketing in (231)a represents one possible analysis of the structure of such examples. Other
analyses are conceivable.
If the RP does not contain a nominal word (i.e. a noun, property word?, or quantifier/numeral), use of the article is obligatory. If a nominal word is present, the article is optional;141in this case, its presence or absence can have functional significance. Its function overlaps the
English definite article, but, rather than indicating definiteness (i.e. identifiability or uniqueness),
the Southern Wakashan article appears to indicate something closer to specificity, e.g. pTF`rFh
in (231)a is more accurately translated ‘the, a certain one that is a man’. The function of the article is considered in more detail in §7.2.21.
The spirit, if not the letter, of the present analysis of RP structure is anticipated by Sapir
(1911a, 1924). The parallelism is somewhat obscured by the fact that, like other writers of the
time (cf. Andrade 1933 on Quileute, and Boas 1947 on Kwakwala), Sapir uses the terms “nominal” and “verbal” in reference to kinds of linguistic categories that are today considered distinct;
he uses these terms to refer to both lexeme categories (noun and verb) and logico-syntactic categories (referring expression or noun phrase and predicate). (We leave open here the question of
whether Sapir himself recognized such distinctions conceptually.) Making allowance for such
terminological conflation, we see the germ of the RPs-as-clauses analysis already in this early
statement (Sapir 1911a: 17): “In both [Nuuchahnulth and Kwakwala] the stem is, as far as its
meaning allows, indifferently verbal [i.e. able to function as predicate––MD] or nominal [i.e. able
to function as a referring expression] and one or more suffixes [clitics] are required to give rise to
definitely verbal [predicative] or nominal [referring] complexes; in [Nuuchahnulth] a suffixed
[<FH] is often used to substantivize [i.e. make referring] a verb [i.e. predicative] form.” Likewise, in Sapir (1924: 84, note 9), he says the article is “often used as [a] nominalizing element”.
A more straightforward antecedent is found in Jacobsen (1979a, 1993), who refers to
“nominalization by the Article of core clauses” (Jacobsen 1993: 256). On the same page he also
claims “[The Nuuchahnulth phrase] KTbrldFh “the woman” ... is formed from KTbrl`
“woman” as a nominalized predicate “the one who is a woman”, with the identifying value that
would be conferred by an English relative clause.” Referring to Makah, he (1979a: 122) says: “...
[F]orms with ,?hp contain undercover predications, so that, for instance, PhcHkhp is literally, or at
least etymologically, ‘(the) one that is a dog’.” This is close to the present analysis, except I142ogically, ‘(the) one that is a dog’.” This is close to the present analysis, except I would omit the
etymological qualification. I claim Southern Wakashan RPs contain predications synchronically,
and, moreover, that all RPs (except proper names), even those without the article, are clauses; the
article is simply an overt marker of the subordinate syntactic status of RPs as referring expressions.60, 61
An alternative line of analysis takes RP structure to be much like that of an English NP, that
is, a phrase consisting of a noun head and optional modifiers (Rose 1981: 39-45, Stonham 1999).
I will forego detailed discussion or critique of “standard NP” analyses except to comment that
they suffer from two main faults: 1) they fail to account for the clause-RP symmetries we have
seen, and 2) they assume the noun is the head of the phrase, but I see no language-internal structural evidence that justifies this assumption (e.g. a noun need not be present, the distribution of
the phrase as a whole is not equivalent to the distribution of the noun, etc.).
4.5.2Root RPsSimple RPs are the most common way of referring to entities. Another option, however, is to use
a “root” RP, i.e. an RP containing a relative root. These RPs are also headless relative clauses,
and are structurally similar to questions (§7.2.15-7.2.16). In this construction, a relative pronoun
root such as M x`p@, N x`pi ‘one who, that which’ or M pih, N pihp ‘whoever, whatever’ is
predicate head with a relative mood clitic and appropriate pronominal clitic attached. Other predicative clitics (e.g. passive-inverse, temporal specifier, tense) appear according to their normal
grammatical behavior. Predicates in the phrase other than the initial relative nominal predicate are
bare absolutes.

If the entity referred to is not equivalent to the subject of the phrase-internal predication, the relative root must in fact have affixed a verbalizing lexical suffix. The default suffix for this purpose
in Makah is ,(j)sh9o ‘doing to, with reference to ...’ and in Nuuchahnulth is -(C)hK [L] id., if a suffix with more specific meaning is not available. Compare the meanings of the root RPs in (234)

Root RPs can function as stand-alone referring expressions, as we have seen in all the examples so far in this section, but they are often set in apposition to simple RPs to form more complex
referring structures. They generally follow apposed simple RPs, but sometimes precede them

+ glottal stop clusters.
23
Like glottalization (§3.3.2), lenition (referred to as “softening” by Wakashanists) is a well described process, and the two are often treated together. Many of same sources are relevant: Sapir
(1924: 92, note 84; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 5-6), Rose (1976,
1981: 18), Nakayama (1997a: 19-20). On lenition in Ditidaht, see Swadesh & Swadesh (1933:
199), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.

Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238) cite QtX`r ‘good on the ground’, but this form is not attested in
the corpus. QtKF`r is found at NA 15.18.

Final /a/ is present underlyingly, but does not appear in the surface form due to a rule of final

32
This, incidentally, raises the question of the historical source of modern Southern Wakashan
non-labialized velars, which, with the exception of /w/, are by no means rare in the present day
languages. That is, if PW velars became alveo-palatals, whence the velar in morphemes like the
N, M root j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’?
33
TRANS = transitivizing suffix used with stative or intransitive verbs (Boas 1947: 241, #6); NOM
= nominal suffix (Boas 1947: 323). Thanks to Emmon Bach for checking my Kwakwala forms.
He drew my attention to the fact that Boas (1947: 353) erroneously writes the ‘lick’ root in (120)c
with a plain voiceless velar stop. I have substituted the correct glottalized form per Lincoln and
Rath (1980: 244).
34
See Haas (1969: 111-112, 115-120) for discussion and examples of similar correspondences
between Nuuchahnulth and Ditidaht.
35
This word, like many others with original */Wi/, now contains morphophonemic /Gi/ (§3.3.2).
36
Makah voiceless stops undergo the allophonic process of coda aspiration described for Nuuchahnulth in §2.1.
37
This example and the next are found on page 16 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in
Jacobsen’s possession.
38
Jacobsen (1996) indicates these segments with a capital barred-l.

Jacobsen (p.c.) has recorded this suffix as ,#` and ,#h. The ,#t form appears in my data.

This example is found on page 9 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in Jacobsen’s possession.

See §2.5 for accent.
42
Some speakers change /@/ preceding /v/ to /N/ so they would have [c`9Kn9w].
43
Interestingly, Ditidaht shows similar patterns of syncope except that, in Ditidaht, it is the second of the two vowels that deletes rather than the first. See Swadesh & Swadesh (1933).
44
This first-syllable shortening sometimes seems to apply also in words that have undergone epenthesis (§3.4.3).
45
More fully translated in Makah as ‘good, rich tasting, full of fat (said of shellfish)’.
46
Actually, the question of whether Makah, Nuuchahnulth, and other languages with lexical verbalizing suffixes can be characterized as incorporating is controversial. I am agreeing with the352view expressed by Sapir (1911b) and Mithun (1984), among others, that these languages are not
incorporating. See Jacobsen (1993: 266-67, note 2) for discussion.
47
Swadesh himself (1933: 11, note 1) compares them to the Latin enclitic conjunction -que.
48
At least one of these, x@K ‘yonder’, is attested in Makah as well.
49
See §4.4.1 for brief comments on grammatical relations. The relevant aspect of this topic here
is that a subject category can be justified for Southern Wakashan.
50
Cf. Swadesh (1933: 101-02).
51
This characteristic of Nuuchahnulth and Southern Wakashan languages contrasts sharply with
the situation in Salish languages, which are generally quite careful about indicating transitivity.
52
However, equational clauses involving personal names, place names, and RPs that contain the
article do require a copular element. See below for discussion.
53
See Chapter 8, note 114 for discussion of classification of property words.
54
Jacobsen (1979a: 114) tentatively reports a possible restriction in Makah against occurrence of
the future tense clitic with nouns. However, I was able to elicit several examples of nouns with
this clitic with no difficulty.
55
A few exceptions to this generalization have turned up in Nuuchahnulth, but syntactic predicates expressing names all seem to have existential readings, e.g. there at the door is Codfishalways-getting it (the name of a family crest), rather than equational readings.
56
See §8.2.3 for the forms of independent pronouns.
57
Cf. Sapir (1924: 86, note 31)
58
This claim does not apply to proper names, which, as discussed in §4.4.3.2, cannot function as
(syntactic) predicate heads.
59
Swadesh (1939: 82) proposes the same analysis, labeling the Nuuchahnulth article a “subject
relative” in a list of modal formatives and glossing it ‘he who is, does’.
60
However, the proper analysis of Makah RPs with possessive clitics, which have essentially the
same syntactic distribution as the article, (e.g. E`o`b<rhr ‘my canoe’) is as yet unclear.
61
Some have suggested that referring expressions in Salish languages are also nominalized predicates or clauses. See, for example, van Eijk (1997) on Lillooet and Thompson, Thompson, &
Egesdal (1996) on Thompson. Similar claims have been made for other languages of the Americas. See Comrie & Thompson (1985: 391-95) for a brief review.
62
Relative roots do have the special property of remaining the grammatical head of the word
when affixed by nuclear lexical suffixes, which otherwise become head themselves. See §5.1.
63
These might be considered a kind of equational clause (§4.4.3.2).
64
Often it is also possible to express manner of action and relation in a single derived verb, with
the manner expressed by the base and the relation by a suffix, e.g. M J`b,hx@, N J`b,H pinchgive.PERF ‘pinch sth off and give it to’, M C`p,hx@, N C`p,`xH push-give.PERF ‘push sth to sb’,
M Bhbj,hx@ throw-give.PERF ‘throw sth to sb’, N b`r,Hbr chase-bringing.along ‘chase sth
along’. For an example of the first word, see (201)b.
65
With some hesitation he terms this construction “serialization”, a characterization I find misleading because of the many differences between the Southern Wakashan construction and constructions called “serial verb” constructions in other languages, e.g. 1) any number of predicates
can be so combined (although more than two or three is uncommon), 2) the set of predicates from
which bare absolute predicates can be drawn is open-ended, 3) any lexical item can fill the role of
main predicate or of the bare absolute.
66
“Serialization combines multiple clauses into a unit that expresses a single state of affairs (=
event or state), i.e. a predication” (Nakayama 1997a: 115).","[366, 367, 368]"
"4.2 Morphology
Makah and Nuuchahnulth are polysynthetic languages making extensive use of suffixation, including enclisis. Reduplicative prefixation, used to form plurals and express aspectual distinctions, is also important. These are the only morphological techniques, apart from a few plural infixes and some aspectually significant changes in vowel length. Reduplication and changes in
vowel length are also used to create special base forms required by some affixes (§3.3.1). There is
no prefixation (apart from reduplicative prefixes), compounding, or noun incorporation.46
4.2.1Word structureA full word (as opposed to a particle) has the structure shown in Figure 1. The structure is
simplified for expository purposes; a slightly more complex description is given in Chapter 5. All
full words (e.g. nouns, verbs, etc.) have the same structure.
An unextended word is formed by a base plus zero, one, or more “lexical” suffixes (derivational suffixes with relatively concrete meanings) and zero, one, or more aspectual morphemes.",[108]

The objects expressing the R and T arguments seem to receive identical grammatical treatment; there is no immediate evidence for recognizing either distinct direct and indirect object re-122lations, or distinct primary object (PO) and secondary object (SO) relations. In a PO/SO system,
the R argument of a ditransitive predicate is treated grammatically like the single P argument of a
transitive predicate (Dryer 1986, to appear). The sentences shown in (198)-(199) might suggest a
PO/SO system in Southern Wakashan, but this is probably artifactual. We have seen that, while
objects are marked by clitics in Makah, they are not in Nuuchahnulth. There is one exception to
this rule: as shown in (198)b, first person objects in Nuuchahnulth are marked in clauses in Imperative mood with second person subjects (§7.2.20).

In an Imperative mood ditransitive clause with a first person R, the R is likewise marked by the

The first person R in (199) is treated like first person P in (198) as in a PO/SO system, but this is
simply a reflection of the general primacy in Southern Wakashan of first person over third person123we already have seen in the discussion of subject choice §4.4.2, rather than evidence of any particular grammatical identity of R and P arguments per se.
The T and R arguments can both be expressed by overt RPs in the same clause, but it is more
common for only one object RP to appear. Frequently one or the other is old information and left
unmarked if third person singular (in Makah) or third person (in Nuuchahnulth):

Another option is to express the R and T in separate clauses with a bare absolute construction

Atransitive predicates have no semantic arguments. Moods are marked just as in other clause
types, but there is no subject reference. Atransitives typically express environmental situations
like weather conditions.

In addition to the apparently clear-cut examples of different predicate types we have seen to
this point, Makah and Nuuchahnulth present not a few cases that are less easy to categorize. As
Dryer (to appear) points out, the classification of predicates based on transitivity in a language
rests on the ability to distinguish transitive verbs (or other transitive predicates) with objects from
intransitive predicates with adjuncts (or obliques). In Southern Wakashan, this distinction is not125always straightforward. First, there is little explicit marking of syntactic relations or transitivity.51
Second, earlier examples like (184)a-f have shown that locative and temporal obliques can occur
in a sentence with no overt marking of their adjunct status. It must be considered at least a possibility that other participant roles (e.g. instrumentals) might occur as unmarked adjuncts as well.
Hence, it is not always clear which non-subject RPs are objects and which are adjuncts. For example, on the face of it, it is unclear whether the instrumental participants in the Nuuchahnulth
examples in (203)a-c (‘club’, ‘stick’, ‘cedar-limb lines’) are objects in some type of ditransitive
construction or adjuncts. (See §4.5 for a more common way of expressing instrumentals.)

Complex (i.e. multiple-predicate) constructions, which we continue our discussion of in this section, are very frequent in Southern Wakashan and classifying them into a definitive set of types is
far from straightforward. Rose (1981), Jacobsen (1993), and Nakayama (1997a) provide three
alternative views of how to divide up the pie. I make a few comments below on differences149among the various schemes, but a comprehensive evaluation of them is a task for the future. The
main area of difference is the status of different kinds of absolute predicates.
The difficulty in classifying multi-predicate constructions arises mostly from the scarce marking of grammatical relationships between words and clauses. The analyst is often left attempting
to differentiate constructions by subtle and sometimes apparently statistical behavioral characteristics of uncertain grammatical significance. Jacobsen (1993: 239-40) provides a useful summary
of the analytic problems one encounters.
Keeping the preceding caveat in mind, I recognize the following types of clauses in complex
constructions: the referring phrases described in §4.5 (i.e. “nominalized” clauses), adverbial
clauses (§4.6.1), and complement clauses (§4.6.2).
4.6.1Adverbial clauses4.6.1.1Bare absolute constructionsAn exceedingly common sentence-building device in Southern Wakashan is to introduce one or
more bare absolute predicates into a sentence with an adverbial function. These elaborate on, expand, or modify the meaning of the main predicate. Subjects must be coreferential.

Bare absolute constructions are a favorite sentence type, and used for a wide variety of expressive
purposes. One frequently finds sentences composed of two transitive predicates in which one
predicate expresses something of the specific manner or type of action affecting the object while
the other expresses the general relation of subject to object. The general relation is often coded by
a verbalizing lexical suffix. For example, in the Nuuchahnulth examples in (240) we see the following distribution of meanings between predicates:
General Relation of ParticipantsSpecific Manner/Type of Action

The semantic patterns are sometimes easier to see with literal translations, e.g.
(240)a: ‘She gave [relation] the women calico by potlatching [manner of action] it to them’
(240)d: ‘She was consuming [relation] worm-wood by eating [manner of action] it’.64151Instrumentals, locations, and other adjunct participants can be introduced into a sentence with
a bare absolute construction (241). Note that here, unlike the construction in (240), the objects of
the transitive predicates in (241)b-d are not co-referential. (The locative RP in (241)e l`GSHFh

Jacobsen (1973: 19) records that the regular past tense clitic <(a)hs may precede the non-past
inferential shown in (386). The semantic difference between this and the past inferential in (387),
if any, is unknown.
7.2.9Inferential I (Nuuchahnulth)The Inferential I mood is to be compared to the other two Nuuchahnulth non-quotative evidential
moods below, the Inferential II (§7.2.17) and the Dubitative (§7.2.18). The first Inferential does
not question the actuality of the event itself as strongly as the Dubitative, but often denotes that
some aspect of it (cause, duration, etc.) has been inferred by the speaker rather than being definitely known. In (388)a, for example, it is not the sleeping that is in doubt, but its duration. In
(388)b, it simply indicates that the event has been learned about after the fact through its effects,
rather than being witnessed directly.

Jacobsen (1973: 19) describes the function of this mood, which he calls the “realizational”, as
“indicating that the speaker has only belatedly perceived, learned, or realized a fact ...”. It also
seems that the fact is generally surprising or unexpected in some way, which makes this mood a
marker of mirativity, as this is described by DeLancey (1997).

Jacobsen (1973: 11) notes a related formation he calls the “counterfactual”, which involves the
Conditional plus the formative ,E`9, as in Ihbtwi`cHpdxE@rHj ‘I wish I were an Indian’.
Speakers I checked with recognized the form, but felt it was archaic and suggested the simple
Conditional instead: Ihbtwi`cHpdxrHj. This may be a result of attrition of more recondite forms
in a language death situation. (In Nuuchahnulth, wishes have been observed in the Subordinate
mood with the irrealis future clitic N <(x)hj: JhlrRhF`shjp`r ‘may I be bitten, i.e. let my bait be
taken!’ at NT 108.8 JhlrRhQ ‘bite on bait’; see also (394)a.)
f) The Conditional may also be used as an indefinite or non-specific article in RPs, replacing the
regular article clitic:280(401)MAKAHa. Ftrta`r

The Conditional may co-occur with the Quotative mood clitic in Nuuchahnulth. Normally,
the Conditional precedes the Quotative:

In Nuuchahnulth, Conditional clauses that are part of a sentence with multiple mood-marked
clauses can be marked as hearsay by the quotative formative <C. For example, the sentence in
(403) is a conditional sentence with two finite clauses, an if-clause (the protasis) and a thenclause (the apodosis). The protasis rhosTo FtpQMtJi`I`spTC ‘if one is holding a stick’ has the
Conditional clitic in combination with <C.

In its capacity as a quasi-indefinite article (§7.2.11), the Conditional mood frequently appears
in relative clauses in which the identity of the referent is unknown or inferred by the speaker (cf.
the Nuuchahnulth Indefinite Relative, §7.2.14).

7.2.13 Definite Relative (Nuuchahnulth)
The Definite Relative forms relative clauses in which the identity or fact of existence of the referent is known or presupposed by both speaker and addressee, either from previous discourse or
world knowledge (cf. the Indefinite Relative, §7.2.14).

"5The 1955 text volume is, unfortunately, riddled with spelling errors, presumably printing
or typographic errors, which renders it almost useless as a data source to linguists not thoroughly familiar with Nuuchahnulth grammar and vocabulary. Nearly every page has at least
one error, and many have multiple errors. Page twenty-one, for example, has at least eight:
e.g. the suffix ‘on the ocean’ in the word pi`L@phlK`Rhrsl`YHpQtjFhsp ‘however many
roundish objects they wish to have on the ocean’ on line four is a misprint for ,`ChRs (the correct
form of the word is thus pi`L@phlK`ChRsl`YHpQtjFhsp), the root lhm@Kh ‘fishing bank’ on
line 14 should be Lhm@Kh+ hmjrXhphmp` on line 39 ‘using a stick as bait’ is missing an initial glottal stop (the correct form is FhmjrXhphmp`), etc. Such errors have been corrected in cited examples without comment.
The grammatical notes and especially the lexical materials in Part III of Sapir & Swadesh
(1939: 235-334) were very important in the preparation of the present work. Analysis of the
composition of the Nuuchahnulth lexicon and all claims about the occurrence or non-occurrence
of forms in it is based on the lists of “primary stems” and suffixes in this source.
Makah data informing the present description comes from several sources. In addition to my
own elicitation notes and texts that I have collected (primarily from speaker HW), several researchers (Ann Renker, Maria Pascua, and Cora Buttram) kindly allowed me access to their
Makah notes. I have also made use of various texts that are on file in manuscript form at the
Makah Cultural and Research Center. These were written or recorded by various speakers in the

"2907.2.18 Dubitative (Nuuchahnulth)
This mood (not to be confused with the dubitative formative <(v)t9r, §7.2.3) acknowledges the
possibility of a non-future event or situation. Speculation about future events is made by
<(v)t9r.

7.2.19 Assertive
The Assertive is essentially a conversational mood, which accounts for its infrequency in the
Nuuchahnulth texts. Rose’s (1981: 224, 225) description of this mood in Kyuquot dialect (where
it is called the “indicative”, see below) applies to its use in Tseshaht as well:291The indicative mood is used for statements of fact validated by experience, observation, general cultural knowledge, or wise authority ... It is also used to indicate that the act of assertion is as communicatively as important as its content.
This can be because the sentence is an important announcement [or] a statement
contrary to the listener’s opinion ...
The Assertive occurs most commonly in the texts precisely where this description would lead us
to predict, in contexts like that of Text 44, in which Tom gives his grandson (Alex Thomas) advice about life:

The Assertive is obligatory with the contrastive particle F`s`:

Rose (1981) and Nakayama (1997a) refer to this mood in Kyuquot and Ahousaht dialects as
the “indicative” mood. Dialects north of Barkley Sound (which include Kyuquot and Ahousaht)
do not have the <(l)@ Indicative mood described for Tseshaht in §7.2.4. The <FHR formative
in these dialects has apparently been named “indicative” because both it and the Tseshaht Indicative are found predominately in conversation, but this analogy is misleading because, as both
Rose (1981: 224) and Nakayama (1997a: 31) point out, <FHR is highly marked pragmatically292even in these dialects and so is not strictly comparable to the Tseshaht Indicative, which is unmarked.
The Assertive occurs in Makah as well. It is not fully attested, but seems to involve <hR
added to Indicative endings, thus first person singular <rhR, first person plural <chR, third person singular, <?hR, etc. Its semantic force seems to involve emphatic assertion:

As in Nuuchahnulth, it occurs in Makah (after the Indicative) with the contrastive particle F`st,
e.g. F`sFtbhR ‘but you (sg.) ...’ (Jacobsen 1973: 18).
7.2.20 Imperative moods
Makah has two Imperative moods. The simple Imperative is shown in Table 20. (For morphological analysis of the forms see Jacobsen 1973: 19-20.)
Table 20. Makah Simple Imperative
Non-subjects(432)Subjects(3sg)2sg<""h2pl<""hC3pl1sg<""`9K <""hr1pl

a`jiÊ""@F`9o<""hC<jd9
buy–buy=IMPER.2pl=ADVISE‘You folks buy it!’
The clitic <jd9 in (432)b follows imperative forms to lessen the force of a command to advice or
polite suggestion.
First person hortatives are formed by preceding the second person acting on first person plural imperative clitics with the causative clitic <""`o. For comparison, non-hortative imperatives
with first plural object are shown in (433). Example (433)a shows a regular (non-hortative) second person singular acting on first person plural imperative; (433)b shows second person plural
acting on first person plural:
(433)MAKAHa. C`pRF`IhcHbtW

C`pÊRhQ<""`Q<""hcn9v`btW
push–PERF=TEMP=IMPER.2pl/1pl‘Push us! (said to more than one person)’
Example (434) shows the above with the causative clitic, which takes the shape <""to after the
temporal specifier. These are now first person hortatives:
(434)MAKAHa. C`pRF`IFtcHbtW
C`pÊRhQ<""`Q<""to<""hch9btW
push–PERF=TEMP=CAUS=IMPER.2sg/1pl‘Let’s push it! (said to one person)’
(434) b. C`pRF`IFtcNv`btW
C`pÊRhQ<""`Q<""`o<""hcn9v`btW
push–PERF=TEMP=CAUS=IMPER.2pl/1pl‘Let’s push it! (said to more than one person)’
The phonological alternations producing these forms are regular but perhaps deserve spelling out.
The clitic sequence underlying (434)a is <""`Q<""to<""hch9btW. Glottalization rules produce294<""`ItFhcHbtW, where the temporal specifier has been glottalized, and the causative /o/ is
dropped before the glottalizing imperative. Next, the resulting /tFh/ sequence is dealt with by assimilating the second vowel to the first, which is then syncopated to produce the surface form:
<""`IFtcHbtW.
The second Makah imperative mood is a “directional” imperative (‘go and ...!’), formed by
<Ch preceding the Simple Imperative clitics:
(435)MAKAHBtBtsjhQCFh
BtÊsji [R+S]ÊhQ<Ch<""h
wash–at.hands–PERF=GoIMPER=IMPER.2sg‘Go wash your hands!’
There are four Imperative moods in Nuuchahnulth. Table 21 shows two, the Present Imperative and Future Imperative paradigms (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 242). First person singular and
plural objects have distinct forms. The columns marked “3 obj” are really just intransitive forms
that also serve to mark third person objects.

In these sentences the locative oblique RPs add information about the locative specification given
by the locative suffixes on the predicate head, i.e.,
(185)a ,""`Wr,hQ --- E`o`Bhp ‘in(to) a vessel, the canoe’
(185)b ,o`Q --- C`aDFhKrhr ‘in the house (on) my bed’

(185)e ,pr,ho --- IhlRr`bFh ‘in(to) a vessel, the boiling box’ in (185)c
Another strategy is for the locative element itself to be the predicate head. The languages differ somewhat as to nature of this locative predicate. Makah has a transitive verb, Fhx`W` ‘(be) at’,
described by Jacobsen (1979a) as a “preposition” (which, for him, is a subtype of transitive verb),115but I prefer to think of it simply as a locational verb. With this verb as predicate head, the locative
RP is not an oblique, but an argument. A path-orientation suffix or locative suffix can occur on
the verb to further specify the location.

The locative verb often occurs in a bare absolute adverbial clause (§4.6.1.1):

Nuuchahnulth has a series of intransitive deictic verbs of which ghK ‘there, at this place’ is
one of the most commonly encountered.48 The locative RP is set in apposition to the deictic verb.
The deictic may or may not contain restrictive path-orientation or locative suffixes that further
specify location.

These constructions certainly do not exhaust the means for expressing location in Makah and
Nuuchahnulth, but at least give an idea of how this function is accomplished.
Locative and temporal modifiers are not the only oblique RP types. Agent RPs in passiveinverse clauses and possessed RPs in clauses with possessor subjects are also oblique:

See §7.3.4 for the possessive subject construction and §7.3.5 for the passive-inverse.
4.4.2The grammar and functional dynamics of subject choiceAn important characteristic of the syntax (really, an interaction between syntax and discourse
principles) is a strong tendency for speech-act participants (i.e. first and second persons) and
highly topical third person arguments to occupy main grammatical roles, particularly subject.49 It
is not, of course, uncommon for languages to show a statistical preference for coding such participants as subjects, but Southern Wakashan stands out for how sensitive the structure of basic
clauses is to reference-related requirements on subject choice. The use of two common constructions, the passive-inverse and possessor-raising constructions, is largely controlled by these concerns. Details are reserved for §7.3.4 and §7.3.5, but a preliminary Makah example will give an
idea of the considerations involved.","[129, 130, 131, 132]"

The same construction is used in Makah except that independent pronouns in Makah do not
have predicative forms. Hence, its cognate to the Nuuchahnulth deictic pronoun, FtWT (with appended vowel), serves as the predicate head regardless of the person of the subject:

Existential predication
Thus far we have seen nominal predicates in class-inclusion and equational constructions. There
is one final function nominal predicates may serve. A nominal expression may function as predicate head in an existential construction. Since existentials are typically used to assert the existence of an entity at a particular location (e.g. English there was water in the bucket), some locative specification usually occurs in the clause as well, either by a following bare absolute verb
with locational meaning (218)a,c-d, or else a restrictive locative suffix (or suffixes) directly affixed to the head (218)b,e-g. The Nuuchahnulth sentence in (218)f also has the adjunct RP BhR@
‘Tsisha (place name)’ expanding the reference of the locative suffix. Note that F`QphlK
Ito`p`j ‘two heating-stones’ in (218)d and F`QphlK`r SHbJhm ‘two thunderbirds on a surface’
in (218)g form complex predicate heads –– cf. (210).","[147, 148]"

the force of an insult –– such a greeting would normally only be given to a child or slave.
The diminutive can also indicate that a situational element other than a participant is small or
less than expected. Example (453) shows the diminutive used to indicate that the group size of a
plural argument is few.

Certain roots in Nuuchahnulth that denote the lower end of a scale (e.g. F`m`GFhr ‘small’
denotes the lower end of the property SIZE) obligatorily take the diminutive. Compare, for example, the pairs of roots in Table 24.

Roots that denote the upper limit of a scale like FHGi ‘big’ can occur with the diminutive as well,
but with these roots it expresses qualified or partial possession of the property, e.g. FHGFhr ‘fairly
big’.
Use of the diminutive with scalar roots in Makah is not obligatory. When it does occur with a
root in this category, it intensifies the meaning: ji`F`vhRC ‘really small’ (ji`F`ji ‘small’).
As first discussed in Sapir (1915), the Nuuchahnulth diminutive can be used to indicate persons with certain “abnormal” physical characteristics other than small size such as lame people,
left-handed people, those who squint or are cross-eyed, hunchbacks, and others. In these cases the
diminutive acts in concert either with a characteristic and otherwise meaningless consonant cluster that is inserted into the word (e.g. ,QR, plus <Fhr to indicate lameness) or with special articulatory changes that are applied to particular groups of consonants (e.g. to indicate those with a
defect of the eye all sibilants are changed to the corresponding lateral stops or fricatives: /r R/
become /K/, etc.). To cite two of Sapir’s examples, S`MdFhrFh ‘the little child’ becomes305S`QRMdFhrFh to refer to or to address a lame child; similarly, x@KF`Ql` ‘He is yonder now’ (x@K
‘yonder’, <""`Q temporal specifier’, <l@ Indicative mood) becomes x@KCGFhB`Ql` to indicate a left-handed person, which Sapir translates as ‘There now he is, poor little left-handed
chap!’.
7.3.2Intentive future (Nuuchahnulth)<F`9pQ (rarely <""`9pQ) (INTENT): This Nuuchahnulth clitic is typically used as a future tense
marker with the implication, though not the necessity, that the subject or some other participant in
the event has control over whether it comes about.

The intentive future does not co-occur with the other future clitics that appear later in the sequence. Rose (1981) reports that <F`9pQ co-occurs with the irrealis <""`9G and the past tense
clitic<(l)hs in Kyuquot dialect, but examples of either are lacking in the Tseshaht corpus.1083067.3.3Temporal specifier<""`Q (TEMP): This ubiquitous clitic, common to both languages, has a number of subtle functions, all of which derive from its basic function of fixing a situation at a specified time in the

It often serves as a device for expressing the temporal succession of a series of events. The
first two sentences of the following Nuuchahnulth excerpt from paragraph one of Text 77 (77.1.4
and 77.1.5 below; NA 385) relate two events in narrative sequence. The third sentence (77.1.6)

The construction in (327)c, which has the perfective suffix added to a base ending in a restrictive
locative suffix, is a common way of indicating motion in Southern Wakashan. Or, phrased in a
less English-centric fashion, we might say what is expressed as motion (with ‘go’ or ‘come’) in
English is often not expressed as motion in Southern Wakashan, but as simple change of location
(‘get to be at X’). This can also be seen with the nuclear verbalizing suffix M, N ,Ch ‘at ...’, which
means ‘get to be at ...’ (usually glossed as ‘go to ...’) when it is followed by the perfective suffix.

With processual bases the perfective expresses either inception of the process or (less commonly)
its occurrence for an unspecified duration. This last usage is an especially clear indication of the
perfective value of the suffix. It is often the case that text examples can be translated either way
with little difference to the overall meaning of the passage.","[240, 241]"
"Finally, there is an obvious difference in denotation between lexical suffixes and clitics. As
we have seen, suffixes often have semantic content akin to that of independent lexical items, or
even phrases, in English, e.g. M ,(ji)h9K [L+S] ‘making ...’, ,hctW ‘looking for ...’, -`chK [L] ‘on
the neck’. The meanings of clitics (e.g. tense, mood) are much more abstract by comparison, and
clearly mark them as belonging to the grammatical, rather than the lexical level, of the language.
Before turning to more detailed discussion of individual clitics, let us remind ourselves of
their general character. Syntactically, clitics are most associated with the predicate, which was
defined in §4.3 as an obligatory predicate head (normally a single word, but sometimes a complex
of property + noun, numeral + noun, etc.) and one or two optional predicate modifiers. Based on254their typical positions in this predicate structure, three types of clitics can be distinguished
(§4.3.4): 1) second-position clitics, which attach to the first word of the predicate, whether head
or modifier, 2) head clitics, which attach at least to the head, and 3) flexibly-positioned clitics.
The Nuuchahnulth sentence in (367) shows exemplars of each category. The second-position
tense, mood, and pronominal subject clitics are hosted by the initial predicate modifier; the passive-inverse and possessive head clitics are hosted by the predicate head EHKr@o ‘cause to escape, run away’; and the flexibly-positioned temporal specifer <""`Q is hosted by both.

However, rightward copying of second-position clitics is sometimes possible and leftward copying of head clitics is common. In (368)a, the subject clitic has been copied from the initial modifier onto the following head, and in (368)b, the passive-inverse has been copied onto the initial
modifier from the following head:

Another situation in which head clitics are copied leftward involves the passive-inverse, which is
often copied from the head of a lower bare absolute complement head onto the head of the higher
matrix predicate (§4.6.2.1):255(369)NUUCHAHNULTHavhJ`s

It has been suggested by some (e.g. Klokeid 1976, Renker 1987) that clitics in Ditidaht and
Makah (and, by extension, Nuuchahnulth) form a second-position AUX constituent. I find examples like (367)-(369) to be evidence against this analysis, since the clitics do not appear to form a
single block or constituent in sentence structure, nor do they all automatically attach to the first
word of the predicate (or sentence).","[269, 270, 271]"

Addition of another nuclear suffix creates a new level of structure. Any number of nuclear suffixes may be so added, each creating a new word which may then serve as base for further derivation. This is essentially a restatement of Swadesh’s (1939: 85) generalization that “[when] a series
of [nuclear] suffixes are added to a [base], each successive suffix makes a new [word] which
serves as the underlying [base] for the next suffix.” The following rewrite rule captures this generalization:
(259)Wordα → Base + Nucα164(259) states that a word of category alpha (i.e. noun, verb, etc.) consists of a base of any category
plus a nuclear suffix of category alpha (i.e. nominalizing, verbalizing, etc.). This rule is recursive;
successive applications of it can add any number of nuclear suffixes, although more than three is
rare in a given word. Multiple suffixes of the same category can be added in succession, or, as
more frequently occurs, the category can change with each suffix.
The phrases and sentences in (260) and (261) each contain derived words with multiple nuclear suffixes. The word in question is repeated below the example’s translation with labeled
bracketing to show its constituent structure; buffer consonants (§5.2.2) and indications of CV
template associations are omitted from the bracketed representations to faciliate readability.

The Nuuchahnulth verbalizing suffix -(b)rl`Y`p` in (261)a actually consists of the verbalizing
suffix ,(b)rl` ‘defending ...’ plus the restrictive plural suffix ,Y`p` (§5.5.4), but the combination may be treated as a single nuclear suffix for our purposes, since it is now more or less lexicalized to mean ‘fighting over, competing in...’ (as in bhp,rl`Y`p` ‘competing in oratory’,
g`V`,brl`Y`p` ‘fighting to eat’, etc.).","[178, 179, 180]"
"99Inherent aspectual values of roots and lexical suffixes seem limited to the following:

4.3.1Mood and pronominal markingSouthern Wakashan predicates may be mood-marked or “absolute,” i.e. not marked for mood. In
Makah, the first word in a mood-marked predicate hosts a clitic indicating mood. Indicative100mood, the default mood for conversation, is marked by its own set of pronominal clitics. (For the

Other moods are generally expressed by a mood clitic followed by a separate pronominal clitic.

In non-Indicative moods, pronominal markers involving first and second persons are transparently structurally distinct from the mood clitics. For third person forms, although a more abstract
analysis is theoretically possible in which the mood markers and pronominal formatives are
sometimes distinct, formal complexities arise that make it more analytically convenient to assume
fused mood-pronominal forms (§7.2.1).

The perfective is most commonly used in discourse to narrate a series of completed past
events. Occasionally, however, it occurs in an otherwise present context. Perfectivity in Southern
Wakashan is by nature incompatible with present time reference: since the speaker, by choosing
the perfective, includes all situation boundaries in the assertion, and thereby asserts its completeness, this leaves little room for the situation to be interpreted as ongoing at the time of speaking.
In a present tense context, a (non-tense marked) word in the perfective is interpreted as immediate
past:
(330)NUUCHAHNULTHEHKRhQ`G
Eh9KÊRhQ<(l)@<`G
escape–PERF=INDIC=1sg‘I have (just) run away.’ (NA 255.49)
Boas (1947: 289) describes a Kwakwala suffix ,wFhc that he refers to as “recent past”. Significantly, there is another Kwakwala suffix with the same form ,wFhc, which is cognate to Southern
Wakashan ,RhQ, that he calls “momentaneous and inchoative” (Boas 1947: 290-91). This alleged
homophony between “recent past” and “momentaneous” morphemes may point to a similar situation in that language.
Perfective marking has become tied up with causative marking. When the perfective suffix is
not present (with no explicit aspect marking, or with the continuative, repetitive, etc.) causative is
expressed by the clitic M, N <""`o. With the perfective suffix, however, it is normally expressed
by a causative perfective portmanteau suffix. The words in (331) are the causative perfective
counterparts to the words in (326) and (327).","[241, 242]"
"2246.4 Perfective
Perfective aspect indicates that all internal phases or boundaries of a situation are included in the
assertion, i.e. are asserted to have taken place; the situation thus is presented as complete relative
to other situations in the discourse context. The exact meaning of the perfective word depends on
the semantics of the base to which the perfective suffix is attached. With punctual bases like M
F`bj`s,, N stw, ‘jump’, M, N IhQp, ‘explode’ or M, N ghr, ‘strike with a beating instrument’
the perfective expresses the simple occurrence of the event. If the base denotes an event that may
occur repetitively, the perfective normally has a semelfactive sense –– it expresses a single repetition of the event.

With stative bases (e.g. nouns, property words, stative verbs) the perfective suffix usually expresses perfective change of state (an inceptive/inchoative/ingressive reading). Comrie (1976: 1920) mentions several other languages that allow this type of reading with perfective markers on
stative verbs. In these languages, among them Ancient Greek, Spanish, and Russian, this possibility is apparently limited to a handful of verbs. In Southern Wakashan, on the other hand, it is the
rule –– almost all stative bases produce a change-of-state readings with the perfective suffix.","[239, 240]"
"134Existentials in which the location is expressed by a following verb –– e.g. (218)a,c-d –– are in
essence multi-clausal reversals of a mono-clausal construction having the locational verb as the
sole predicate head and the nominal expression as its subject. (218)c-d, for instance, could be expressed equally well with such a mono-clausal sentence:

Nominal predicates containing restrictive path-orientation or locative suffixes are a special
case. They are often atransitive existentials (in (218)b,e-g, for example). In some cases, however,
they are intransitive with personal subject reference. In this use, the subject referent is asserted to
have some relation with the referent of the nominal base that can be loosely referred to as possession.57 Schematically: ‘X [subject referent] has Y [referent of nominal base] at Z [location denoted by suffix(es)]’. I call this the possessive-existential (or bahuvrihi) reading. Consider the
examples in (220).

It is often unclear whether a third person referent in a sentence with a restricted nominal predicate
(i.e. a predicate containing a predicate head with a restrictive locative suffix) is to be interpreted
as the subject of the predicate (triggering a possessive-existential reading) or as a locative adjunct
expanding the reference of the restrictive suffix(es) (triggering a simple existential reading). This
ambiguity exists in (220)c, for example. The source translates the sentence assuming the first
reading, as if M@r`otKFh ‘a day screen (a board with a painting depicting a mythological subject
on it)’ were the subject of the nominal predicate ptF`bF`BtK F`Q`F`BtK ‘(be) two people on a
surface’, but it is just as likely to be a locative RP expanding the reference of ,-F@Bt(K), that is,
an adjunct further specifying the identity of the surface the two people are on. The alternative
readings are ‘a day screen has two people on it’ and ‘there are two people on a day screen’. Another ambiguous Nuuchahnulth example is shown in (221). This sentence is especially interesting
because it contains two restricted nominal predicates. The first is the main complex predicate
head b`pHbs`phlKBt l@sl@r ‘twenty tribes in a container’; the second is the relative clause

The relative clause is clearly possessive-existential: the first person pronominal clitic assures us
of that. The question is whether F`G x`Y`pQMtjp`r ‘this that I have in my hand’ is the subject
of the main predicate (translation a) or an adjunct RP expanding the reference of the locative suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ (translation b).","[149, 150, 151, 152]"

The two situations of the bird being alive and the speaker traveling home are clearly to be taken
as temporally overlapping: ‘... was alive as I returned home’. For another example, see (359)b.
Comrie (1976: 16-17) argues against equating perfectivity with short duration or momentaneous occurrence in part by citing examples from several languages that show perfective verbs in
construction with temporal expressions that imply duration like ‘for an hour’ and ‘for ten years’,
e.g. Ancient Greek ebasíleuse (perfective past) déka étē ‘he ruled ten years’. A similar argument
can be made in Southern Wakashan, with the difference that the temporal expressions themselves
take the perfective marking; they are complement-taking words that serve as matrix predicate
heads for the temporally modified complement clauses (§4.6.2.1), e.g. pH ‘(do) [COMP] for a
long time’ and lTCHK ‘(do) [COMP] for four days’. The perfective suffix with these expressions
indicates the completion of the time period denoted by the matrix.

Before discussing the functions of each aspectual morpheme in more detail in §§6.4-6.5, a summary of how the different aspects are marked is in order (Table 12). Perfective aspect is inherent
in the meaning of some free roots and lexical suffixes, e.g. M, N v`g@ji ‘go (perf.)’, M, N ,""hQ
[L] ‘get ... (perf.)’, M ,(j)rhKs`, N ,(b)rtGs` ‘come out of the woods (perf.)’. If it is not inherent,

suffix with changes to
vowel length of the baseperfective aspect is marked by the M, N suffix ,RhQ, which has many allomorphs (Table 13). A
handful of free roots and lexical suffixes (e.g. M FhFHWi`, N FHGi ‘big’, N X@p ‘long’) take the
“inceptive” suffix ,#`ChQ instead: X@p`ChQ ‘become long’. However, other roots and lexical suf-223fixes, particularly those with final vowels or (in Nuuchahnulth) coda nasals (§2.3), are marked for
perfective aspect by another suffix, M ,dx`ChQ or ,h9vhQ, N ,h9ChQ, traditionally known in the
literature as the inceptive: M ctCHvhQ ‘turn into a mountain’ (ctChFH ‘mountain’), N
phC`mHChQ ‘become a louse’ (phChm ‘louse’).
Perfective aspect is essentially marked by a single suffix (the inceptive suffixes notwithstanding), but imperfective aspect is indicated in a variety of ways. Most free roots and lexical suffixes
are inherently imperfective and require no special imperfective marking: M phCHc`, N phChm
‘louse’, M, N ,""`r ‘on the ground’, M -hctW, N ,M@G ‘seeking ...’. If a word is already perfective, it can be imperfectivized by the graduative, indicated by the [L+S] CV template (see example (324)).91 The durative suffix ,`ji ,tj added to a bound root indicates a stative intransitive
imperfective aspect: N mhmj`ji ‘wrapped around’ (mhmj, ‘twist, wrap around’); it also occurs
with many bound roots denoting manner of motion: M WHFtj ‘crawling’ (Wh, ‘crawl’). The continuative suffix ,(x)@ or, occasionally, the [L] CV template, with a bound root indicates dynamic
imperfective aspect: verb N mhmj@ ‘getting wrapped around’, verb M, N C`p@ ‘pushing’ (C`p,
‘push, shove’).
In addition to the graduative, durative, and continuative imperfective aspects, which can be
called “uniplex” imperfective aspects, there are two multiplex aspectual formations, the repetitive
and the iterative. These imply various types of iteration of events versus the essentially steadystate meanings of the uniplex aspects. The repetitive, which expresses events repeated at regular
and generally narrow-spaced intervals, is formed by a special reduplication type plus the suffix
-(x)`. As we will see below, the repetitive has expanded its function somewhat beyond this in
Makah to cover semantic space expressed by the continuative in Nuuchahnulth. The iterative,
which expresses irregular iteration, is formed in two ways, one involving reduplication, and the
other involving changes to the perfective form of the base.","[236, 237, 238, 239]"

base and suffixes, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Not indicated in Figure 1 is the fact that words may also be marked as plural or distributive
by reduplication, infixation, or some combination of the two. Such plural/distributive marking is
grammatically optional and subject to many formal irregularities. See §5.5.4 for examples.
Depending on its syntactic role and position in a sentence, the morphological construct of
base + lexical suffixes + aspect (called the “unextended” word by Swadesh 1933, 1939) can take
additional formatives known variously as “incremental suffixes” (Swadesh 1933, Sapir &
Swadesh 1939), “word suffixes” (Swadesh 1939), “inflectional suffixes” (Rose 1981), or
“peripheral suffixes” (Nakayama 1997a) to form an “extended” word. Such formatives express
clause-level grammatical categories like tense, mood, voice, and pronominal indexes.
Though all the aforementioned authors refer to these formatives as “suffixes” of one type or
another, their status as such is actually rather ambivalent. They differ from lexical and aspect suffixes on a number of phonological, morphological, and semantic points (see Chapter 7 for a summary list). Some researchers (e.g. Klokeid 1976, 1978, Jacobsen 1979a: 151, note 31, Renker
1987) have suggested that these formatives in Ditidaht and Makah are actually clitics (an analysis
that extends easily to Nuuchahnulth as well).47 This idea appears to account for a number of their
syntactic properties.
The unextended word carries the lexical (dictionary) meaning of the word, while the clitics
specify values for grammatical categories associated with the word in its syntactic context. As
Swadesh (1933: 11) puts it for Nuuchahnulth: “From the lexical point of view, the word is the
unextended unit composed of stem plus derivational and aspect suffixes. From the syntactic point
of view, the word is the total phonetic unity, sometimes identical with the lexical unit, sometimes
more or less extended by [enclitic] elements.” In (153), for example, Makah vdFhE`k ‘he/she/it is95sleeping’ is formed from the verb vdFhC ‘sleep’ plus the temporal specifier clitic <""`Q glossed
“TEMP” (explained in §4.3.2 below) and<?h, the third person singular Indicative mood clitic.
(153)MAKAHvdFhE`k
vdFhC<""`Q<?h
sleep=TEMP=INDIC.3sg‘He/she/it is sleeping.’
In general, words functioning as predicate heads in main clauses have the greatest potential for
hosting clitics. The clitics occur in an ordered sequence of slots following their host (§7.5). First
come clitics coding categories like the causative, passive-inverse, and tense. Next are mood and
pronominal clitics indexing subjects and, in Makah, some non-subjects. As seen in (153), third
person formatives in Makah have fused with mood clitics. In Nuuchahnulth, there is no marking
for third person in most moods. Finally, a word may end with one or more clitics drawn from a
small post-modal set that includes a morpheme expressing the plurality of a third person participant, a morpheme meaning ‘again’, and a habitual marker. See §4.3 for more on clitics and their
place in the structure of the predicate.
4.2.2Lexical suffixesThe 500 or so lexical suffixes can be divided into two main types (§5.3). The first type, nuclear
suffixes (§5.4), includes nominalizing suffixes (154) and verbalizing suffixes (155):
(154)Examples of nominalizing suffixesM ,`Bhr, N ,`Btr ‘surface, platform for ...’
M ,HshFh9, N ,Hs` ‘... -er’
M ,(j)r`b, N ,(b)r`b ‘container, vessel for ...’
M ,x`ji, N ,X`ji ‘thing, instrument for ...’
(155)Examples of verbalizing suffixesM ,`a`9Bt, N ,l`Btj ‘talking about ...’M, N ,Jtj [R] ‘resembling ...’96M ,Bhr, N ,Btr [L] ‘laughing at ...’M, N ,O`K ‘smelling like ...’M ,c@ji, N ,m@ji ‘having ...’M ,rta`C, N ,rhlC [L] ‘do ritual for ...’M ,hctW, N ,M@G ‘seeking ...’M ,tF`K, N ,(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’The second type, restrictive suffixes (§5.5), consists mostly of suffixes indicating spatial disposition including path-orientation suffixes (156) and locative suffixes (157):
(156)Examples of path-orientation suffixesM, N ,(-F)`K ‘attached on’
M ,@xhQ, N ,`xh9FhQ ‘enter a building (perf.)’
M, N -jihr,s, ‘move away from (perf.)’
M ,a`K,, N ,l`K, ‘moving about’
N ,MHp, ‘down a slope (perf.)’
(157)Examples of locative suffixesM ,""`Wr, N -""`Gr ‘in a vessel’
M, N ,@rB` ‘on the roof’
N ,hmjrS`r ‘at the back of the head’
M ,`chK, N ,(v)hmK [L] ‘on the neck’
M ,(j)rF`shFh9, N ,(b)rF`st [L] ‘at the door’
At least since Sapir (1924) ellipses, i.e. the symbol “...”, have been included in the glosses of
nuclear suffixes to indicate the relation of the meaning of the suffix to that of the base, that is,
where the meaning of the base “fits” in the meaning of the suffix. Ellipses are not used in glosses
of restrictive suffixes because they have essentially additive relations with bases that are always
semantically predictable. In this dissertation nuclear ellipses are used only with glosses in the
body of the text and not in morpheme-by-morpheme glosses for reasons of economy.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112]"
"180His worries about imposition of external categories on the object language are clearly wellfounded, and even today this is a common pitfall of comparative semantic research. Lucy (1994:
624) describes such research as follows:
Lexical items are grouped together [in analyses of this sort] and analyzed as a
coherent set not because speakers of those languages group them together in a set
as revealed, for example, by common grammatical treatment, but because the
analyst so groups them. And meanings are assigned not on the basis of close examination of actual usage, but on the basis of rough functional equivalence with
forms in our own language. Thus an external framework is imposed on the language in place of a framework deriving from its native logic.
Conclusions from these studies are likely to reveal more about the external framework than about
the language under analysis.
Fortunately, we need not content ourselves with a classification of lexical suffixes in Southern Wakashan that is descriptively useful, but ultimately of little value in understanding how the
languages works. We can make use of language internal criteria, both semantic and formal, to
classify the suffixes following “native logic”. Given the importance of the suffixes in the grammar, this is, in fact, an essential task. As we know, however, “all grammars leak”, so there is no
reason to expect every suffix to fit neatly into our classification scheme, whether its logic is native or external. By and large, suffixes do fall fairly clearly into one category or another, but a
few belong to more than one category, and we are left with the inevitable residue of suffixes that
are difficult to classify.
Use of language internal criteria can be demonstrated by considering the status of two ostensibly similar Nuuchahnulth suffixes, ,Ch ‘at, in ...’ and ,BT ‘in a container’. At first glance, one
might think to group these together as “locative” suffixes. However, closer study of their semantic relationship with bases and their effect on the grammatical category of the resultant word
shows that, according to Nootkan logic, they actually belong to different categories. Consider
(275), which shows each suffix with the simple noun root p`FTb ‘pack-basket’ as base.","[195, 196]"
"273 Phonological Alternations
A variety of phonological alternations take place during word formation, the most important and
common of which are described in this chapter. The presentation is descriptive in intent and informal for the most part, although, for descriptive purposes, it does assume a model of phonology
with extrinsically ordered rules applied to underlying forms.
The alternations are presented in order of application to underlying forms except that the
automatic alternations in §3.2 are ordered after the morpheme-specific alternations in §3.3 even
though they are described first for expository reasons. The important issue of vowel-length alternations is discussed apart from the other alternations in §3.1. Only alternations of some generality
are discussed individually in this chapter; those that are restricted to a few morphemes or are
rarely encountered are introduced as necessary.
Underlying forms, which do double duty as citation forms, frequently contain diacritics that
specify how or if certain morpheme-specific rules apply. It has not been possible to avoid using
morphemes with diacritics in examples before the diacritics themselves have been introduced;
readers may consult the list of abbreviations and symbols after the Table of Contents for brief
explanations of them. Most are used in the same way as in Sapir and Swadesh’s works, where
they were originally introduced (see especially Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-39), although their
diacritic conventions have been simplified in a few cases. Some of their original diacritics are
used to abbreviate sets of allomorphs (cf. McCawley 1967: 108): they represent the phonological
properties of each allomorph in a single citation form by “superimposing” the allomorphs on one
another. Sometimes, however, the present analysis posits a single underlying form for such lexical items rather than an allomorph set, which eliminates the need for Sapir and Swadesh’s diacritic. For example, labialized consonants alternate with their non-labialized homorganic counterparts in word-final position and a few other environments (§3.2.2), e.g. we find l`l@rhX`ji,Hb28‘belonging to a mud shark’, but l`l@rhX`j ‘mud shark’ without the suffix. In Sapir and
Swadesh’s analysis, the ‘mud shark’ root has two allomorphs, the word-final allomorph
/l`l@rhX`j/ and the pre-vowel allomorph /l`l@rhX`ji,/. They merge these to produce the
citation form l`l@rhX`j(i,), where the parentheses and hyphen show that the labialized allomorph appears before vowel-initial suffixes. The analysis proposed in §3.2.2, on the other hand,
posits the underlying form l`l@rhX`ji and an automatic delabialization rule. With this analysis
the parentheses and hyphen are redundant: since no labialized final consonant fails to alternate in
the relevant environment, there is no need for a special mark to signal the alternation.12
Many of the alternations described in this chapter are triggered by affixation. The language
distinguishes an inner layer of affixes, mostly suffixes but also a few infixes, from an outer layer
of enclitics. The inner affixes include various aspectual formatives and “lexical” suffixes, suffixes
with relatively concrete meanings like the verbalizing suffix ,rhlC ‘doing ritual for ...’. The clitics are more loosely joined to their host phonologically, and typically have more abstract grammatical functions than inner-layer affixes, coding grammatical categories like tense, mood, and
person and number of the subject. The inner affixes and the clitics behave differently with regard
to several of the phonological alternations described. Differences will be noted piecemeal as we
go along, and a summary list of them can be found in Chapter 7.","[42, 43, 44]"
"355105There are a few examples of it attaching to a lone demonstrative in Nuuchahnulth, however,
e.g. F`GjTFh ‘that one’.
106
Tseshaht x@ is probably cognate with the morpheme g@ in Kyuquot dialect that Rose (1981:
40) describes as a definite article.
107
In Makah, the article itself may be extended by demonstrative elements: <?hp`9c proximate
article, e.g. PhcHkhp@c ‘this dog’, <?hp@b distal article, e.g. PhcHkhp`9b ‘that dog’.
108
See Rose (1981: 206, ex. 43; 209, ex. 60-61)
109
Rose (1981), Rose & Carlson (1984), Whistler (1985), Emanatian (1986), and Nakayama
(1997b) may be consulted for further discussion of passivization in Nuuchahnulth, especially the
controversy over whether this construction should be properly be considered a passive or an inverse. The reader will correctly infer from my labeling the morpheme in question “passiveinverse” that I consider the question to be terminological. The Southern Wakashan construction
simply mixes properties associated with constructions called “passive” and “inverse” in other
languages. It appears to be intransitive like the English passive, but is subject to person and topicality hierarchies like inverse constructions in Algonquian languages.
110
An obvious alternative analysis of this construction some have suggested describes ,(C)hK as an
object case marker. Rose (1981: 62-67) presents several arguments against such an analysis and
for a multi-clausal analysis like the one given here.
111
This is perhaps a typo for ,@bxhm, the normal shape of this suffix, cf. Sapir & Swadesh (1939:
319).
112
Makah has a morpheme ,""tW seems analogous to the Nuuchahnulth irrealis clitic, but it is not
yet fully analyzed.
113
In formal speeches first person singular forms may have plural reference (i.e. ‘I’ = ‘we’).
114
The classification of many words expressing property concepts is unclear. This uncertainty
primarily involves free roots like dimension terms, e.g. M, N F`p ‘wide’, M FhFHWi`, N FHGi
‘big’, and evaluative terms, e.g. M QtKT, N QtK ‘good’, and also some words with the durative
aspect suffix, e.g. M, N Ihrtj ‘white’, M, N F`C`ji ‘propped, wedged up’. Most property words
probably belong to a subclass of verbs, as proposed by Jacobsen (1979a), but some may constitute a separate class of adjectives (Rose 1981). Their syntax requires further investigation before
definitive classification can be made. Other property words such as those formed with suffixes I
have classified as verbalizing state suffixes (§5.4.1), e.g. M ,chs, N ,mhs ‘stocked with ...’, M, N
-h9b ‘belonging to ...’, are more clearly verbs.
115
Jacobsen (1979a: 84-108) includes a thorough review of various proposals concerning Southern Wakashan word classes in both the primary and secondary literature.
116
This is a different sense of “nominal” from the one used in the preceding list of word classes,
where the word simply means ‘having the character of a noun, noun-like’.
117
I therefore disagree with Nakayama’s (1997a: 64) contention that “...[T]here is no strong formal basis for positing word classes in Nuu-chah-nulth. That is, there is no unique and constant
correspondence between sets of words and formal markers or formal structuring patterns that justifies grammatical classes among words.”
118
Note also that this is a rare example of a post-head predicate modifier hosting a clitic.
119
The speaker is the mythological culture hero Kwatyaat, whose speech is characterized by inserted /x/’s (Sapir 1915, reprint 1949: 186; Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 210, footnote 8).
120
Jacobsen (1979a: 106) makes the same claim: “[T]he momentaneous [i.e. perfective––MD]
formation ... derives verbs from stems of other classes.”","[370, 371]"
"4The corpus locations of example words in the phonology and word structure chapters
(Chapters 2-3, 5) are usually not given, but sentence examples in other chapters are cited by
page and line number in Sapir (1924) (abbreviated “RW”), Sapir & Swadesh (1939) (“NT”),
and Sapir & Swadesh (1955) (“NA”), e.g. NA 159.4 indicates the example is found on the
fourth line of page 159 in Sapir & Swadesh (1955).
Sentences illustrating this or that grammatical construction often contain complications
that might obfuscate, rather than illuminate, it. Accordingly, I have introduced two sorts of
modification when citing Nuuchahnuth text sentences in support of grammatical claims. The
first is omission: grammatically optional words or clauses irrelevant the point being made are
sometimes left out. Ellipses indicate omitted material. For example, a text sentence intended
to demonstrate a simple transitive clause like the Nuuchahnulth analogue of The next morning they charred their canoe-bottoms to make them smooth in the water might be simplified in
the dissertation example to ...They charred their canoe-bottoms...","[19, 20]"
"61.4 Previous literature
Despite the fact that the Southern Wakashan languages have attracted some of the finest minds in
North American linguistics, only one complete grammar is available, Rose’s (1981) grammar of
the Kyuquot dialect of Nuuchahnulth. This work provides an important counterbalance to the
rather anemic view of Nuuchahnulth syntax presented by Swadesh (1939) and, among other discoveries, recognizes the imperfective/perfective nature of the aspect system. There is a fair
amount of descriptive material on Southern Wakashan in theses, journal articles and conference
presentations. Much of this material is about the Tseshaht dialect of Nuuchahnulth, and is the
work of Edward Sapir (Sapir 1911a, 1915, 1924, 1929, 1938), who initiated the scientific study of
Nuuchahnulth, and his student and colleague, Morris Swadesh (Swadesh 1931, 1933, 1939,
1948a). There are also the two volumes of Nuuchahnulth texts edited by Sapir and Swadesh
(1939; 1955). Other notable works on Southern Wakashan languages other than Makah or not
exclusively on Makah include two Nitinaht texts with grammatical analysis (Swadesh & Swadesh
1933, Touchie 1977), papers on historical reconstruction by Haas (1969) and Jacobsen (1969a), a
discussion of labialization in Nootkan languages (Jacobsen 1969b), an investigation of NootkaNitinaht stem and root structure (Haas 1972), a discussion of variable-length vowels in Nuuchahnulth (Klokeid 1975), a thesis on Nuuchahnulth phonology (Rose 1976), studies of Nitinaht enclitics (Klokeid 1976, 1978), a note on Nitinaht numerals (Hess 1990), a discussion of Mary Haas’s
contributions to Wakashan linguistics (Jacobsen 1997b), and several papers on Nootkan syntax
(Rose & Carlson 1984, Whistler 1985, Emanatian 1986, Jacobsen 1993, Nakayama 1997b). The
interaction of discourse and morphosyntactic structure in Nuuchahnulth is discussed in Nakayama
(1997a); Nuuchahnulth-Nitinaht ablaut and reduplication patterns are discussed in Stonham
(1994a). Stonham (1999) describes noun phrase structure in Nuuchahnulth.","[21, 22]"

4.4.1RP functions and constituent orderIn addition to the predicate, a clause can (but need not) contain referring expressions that function
as subjects and objects, or in oblique roles. Referring expressions are expressed syntactically as
referring phrases (RPs) (§4.5). The predicate usually comes first in the clause followed by the
core (i.e. subject and object) RPs in either order. There is no case-marking or other overt means
of indicating which RP is subject, and which is object.

Finally, dialects can vary as to which morphemes have reduced sequences and which do not. In
Tseshaht dialect, the dialect of most of our examples, the subordinating modal particle F`mh ‘that,
because’ does not have a reduced vowel; in Kyuquot dialect (Rose 1981), on the other hand, this
particle is reduced: Fhm.
Given the existence of both reducing and non-reducing morphemes, it is natural to ask
whether any conditioning factors for reduction can be found. Unfortunately, little of substance
can be said at this point. Sapir (1924: 84, note 9) relates reduction of post-nasal vowels to lack of
accent on the reduced vowel: “The common Nootka groups ιmh and ιlh, in which the h represents a
murmured-i vowel, go back to fuller forms of type a (or ι, u) + n or m + a (or ι, u), in which the
second vowel is unaccented.” But this fails to account for morphemes like ,o`m`C in (14), where,23according to the basic accent rule (§2.5), the second vowel can never be accented, but remains
unreduced.
It is also clear that, in at least some cases, reduction is optional. In the texts, we find, for example, both unreduced x`bM@phmtQ and reduced x`bM@phmQ ‘climb up (to the summit)’ and
unreduced x`pi@mTQ and reduced x`pihmQ ‘that’s why, therefore, for this reason’:

‘grizzly bear’. See below. In addition to the phonemes in Table 8, one word in Makah contains
/g/: WhfHchs ‘Clallam Bay (place name)’, a borrowing from Clallam, a neighboring Salish language.
The Makah and Nuuchahnulth inventories (see Table 1) differ in four ways.34 First, as described in Jacobsen (1969a), the Proto-Southern-Wakashan ejective uvular stops and uvular fricatives shifted to pharyngeals in Nuuchahnulth, but were retained in Makah:
(126) PSWMN*PPYM PhcHQ, N YhmHQ ‘dog’*PiPiYM PihC,, N YhC, ‘rotten’*WWGM W`CH, N G`CH ‘deep down’*WiWiGM FhFHWi`, N FHG ‘big’3576The other three differences have to do with historical changes in the original sonorant system.
These have interconnected results, so it is convenient to describe them together. These changes
are as follows:
1. The PSW nasals have shifted to voiced stops in Makah, which accounts for the rarity of
/l/ and /m/ in the language.
2. The PSW glottalized sonorants have merged with the plain sonorants in Makah. Loss of
glottalization has been accompanied by compensatory lengthening of preceding vowels
(Jacobsen 1968).
3. PSW )/k/ has merged with /m/ in Nuuchahnulth, but remains in Makah as /k/.
These changes produce the correspondences shown in (127). I have chosen examples with original word-medial glottalized sonorants to make the effects of compensatory lengthening in the
Makah forms more apparent.

will see as the discussion progresses (§3.4.2).
The change of nasals to stops is uncommon cross-linguistically, but has occurred in other
languages of the Northwest Coast region, both related and unrelated, viz. Ditidaht (Southern Wa-77kashan), Quileute (Chimakuan), Lushootseed (Salish), and Twana (Salish) (Thompson &
Kinkade 1990).
Makah vowels are shown in Table 9. Pronunciation details are similar to those given in §2.2
for Nuuchahnulth except that, as pronounced by most speakers, the Makah high back vowels are
closer to cardinal value, the long mid back vowel is tense rather than lax, the short central vowel
is [¿] rather than [a], and the long mid front vowel is [æ9] rather than [e9].
Table 9. Makah vowel inventory
FrontCentralBackHigh h Ht Td Dn NMid
Low` @Short vowels frequently have tense allophones. More research is required before definitive
statements can be made, but at this point it seems fairly certain that the short high vowels and
sometimes /`/ have tense allophones before sonorants, e.g.
(128)ghxT [ghxt9]‘stop, finish’ShptvhK [SHptvHK]‘sitting room’F`xhr`ptj [F`xHr¿pUjig]36‘tricky, mischievous’The short high back vowel also seems to have a tense allophone before labial stops, e.g. stojr@o
‘blacken sth’ [stogjgr`9og].
We noted in §2.2 that the mid vowels in the Nuuchahnulth inventory given by Sapir &
Swadesh (1939) (see Table 3) were phonemically marginal. The same applies to Makah: they frequently arise by secondary processes, but belong in the inventory because they appear in several
words where they cannot be accounted for by rule, e.g. Fdc discourse particle, JnFtK, ‘further
away, a little ways’, JnknFN ‘wild currant’.","[91, 92, 93]"
"35367See Anderson (1985: 9-10) and Spencer (1991: 37-39) for introductory discussion. In Sapir’s
(1921: 142-43) morphological typology, Nuuchahnulth (or Nootka, in his terminology) is classified as having a polysynthetic level of synthesis and “agglutinative (symbolic tinge)” technique.
68
See Fortescue (1994) for more detailed characterization of polysynthetic languages.
69
In a 100-word sample from Text 2 in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 19-21), Jacobsen (1993: 266)
counts an average of 3.66 morphemes per word in Nuuchahnulth, which just slightly lower than
Greenberg’s (1954) figure of 3.72 morphemes per word in a similar sized sample from Eskimo.
70
Figure 2 should be understood as a static representation of the structure of existing words,
rather than a generative device for creating new words. Without extensive filtering or constraint
mechanisms, Figure 2 will generate many impossible words.
71
This statement does not apply to words formed on relative roots like N x`pi, M x`p@ ‘one
who, that which’, which always determine the category of the resultant word regardless of suffix
type, e.g. N x`pi plus the verbalizing suffix N ,FhC ‘clothed in ...’ forms the noun x`piFhC
‘clothing, what one is wearing’ rather than the verb *‘wearing sth that is ...’.
72
The terms “core” and “peripheral” are borrowed from Nakayama (1997a), where they are used
in a different sense.
73
See Haas (1972) for more on Nootkan root structure.
74
As mentioned later (see note 114 in Chapter 8), it is not clear if evaluative and dimensional
terms are a subclass of verbs or constitute a separate class of adjectives.
75
See Rose (1981: 284-89) for a different classification scheme.
76
Eskimo languages also have suffixes of this type, which are sometimes called “post bases” in
the specialist literature (e.g. Jacobson 1984, Miyaoka 1996). Eskimo, Wakashan, and Quileute are
strikingly similar in their reliance on these suffixes to the virtual exclusion of other wordformation techniques. Eskimo languages are even more extreme than Wakashan and Quileute in
this respect.
77
Other works refer to nuclear suffixes as “governing” suffixes, a term I avoid since nuclear suffixes sometimes do not “govern” the base in the sense used in current grammatical theory.
78
This statement is generally true, but oversimplified. Certain restrictive path-orientation suffixes
have the effect of deriving verbs due to their inherent perfective aspect (§5.5.1). In these cases,
the restrictive suffix could be considered the grammatical head, but the base remains in some
sense the main semantic element.
79
These types roughly correspond to Swadesh’s (1933, 1939) governing action and governing
state suffixes.
80
Rose (1981: 357-58) categorizes most of my verbalizing state suffixes as “adjectival” rather
than “verbal” suffixes, but, assuming her (p. 344) definition of the adjective class, it is not clear
how this could be correct. Jacobsen (1979a: 139) refers to Makah ,h9b ‘belonging to ...’ as forming adjectives, but since he considers Makah adjectives a subtype of intransitive verb, there is no
disagreement with the present analysis.
81
Locale suffixes are called “zone” suffixes in Davidson (1999).
82
The initial vowel is shortened due to insertion of the long epenthetic vowel (§3.4.3).
83
“The use of suffixes for adding new material ideas to the initial morpheme is common to a restricted area inhabited by all the Kwakiutl dialects, Nootka [and other Southern Wakashan languages––MD], Quileute, and Salish. Outside of this area it is unknown. Its closest analogue is
found in the suffixes of the Eskimo language” (Boas 1947: 236).
84
This root element must go back to Proto-Wakashan, cf. Kwakwala forms such as vhP5mWi` ‘to
fail to go straight to a person’ (Boas 1947).","[368, 369]"

Rose (1981: 263) and Nakayama (1997a: 27) both analyze the continuative as indicating that
“a dynamic situation ... is enduring through time” (Rose 1981: 263). This definition is adequate as
long as “dynamic” is defined along the lines suggested by Comrie (1976: 13): “[Dynamic situations] require a continual input of energy if they are not to come to an end”. That is, there need be
no activity or change per se, but some energy or force must be exerted to maintain the situation. A
crucial set of examples shows that activity and change are not required to license the continuative.
Along with dynamic process roots like M, N Eh, ‘cut’ and M, N BHp, ‘chant’, the continuative
also regularly occurs with roots denoting attachment, adhesion, holding, etc: M, N JT ‘hooked’,
N Btop@ ‘stuck in, planted’, M Jihs@, N Jihm@ ‘stuck on’, M I`o@, N I`l@ ‘two-pronged
object clamped on (e.g. clothespin on line)’, M a`Q@, N l`Q@ ‘tied’, M a@, N L@ ‘holding in

M, N rT ‘holding in hand’.

none of the situations they denote can be described as action or change. Any of them could undergo change of some sort, e.g. something can suddenly become unstuck from a surface, or ropes
can gradually loosen around a bundle, but change is not intrinsic to their nature as it is with a
situation like that denoted by Eh, ‘cut’. But neither are they inherently stable –– some application
of force, external or internal, is necessary for the maintenance of the expressed configuration.
Application of force seems to be the core meaning of this use of the continuative.
In Nuuchahnulth, when the continuative occurs with stative roots it expresses imperfective
inception: stpi@ ‘melting’ (stp,), bhj@ ‘becoming aslant, overbalanced’ (bhj,), Ihr@ ‘whitening, dawning’ (Ihr, ‘white, bright’).

stlÊ`oh [L]FHpGH Ihr@F`Qwwwwwwwwwwwww
FHpGH IhrÊ(x)@<""`Qdark–in.airstillbright–CONT=TEMP‘It was still a bit dark as it dawned.’ (NA 157.8)
In this use, the continuative appears to overlap the graduative (§6.5.1). It is not known whether a
root like stp, ‘melted’ also occurs with the graduative (added to its perfective form), and, if so,
how this form is different in meaning from the continuative, i.e. do we find sTpRhQ ‘melting’
along with stpi@ ‘melting’?
In their list of Nuuchahnulth “primary stems” (1939: 243-316), Sapir and Swadesh record
most bound verb roots as occuring with the continuative, e.g. Btpi@ ‘to punch’, CtWi@ ‘to
tickle’, stwi@ ‘to jump’. In Makah, the continuative is generally disallowed with such roots, the
repetitive (§6.5.4) being preferred instead as the basic imperfective aspect. In this language, the
continuative appears restricted to situations that are truly continuous, involving little internal
structure and no distinguishable phases. Some light is shed on this by HW’s response when queried about Btpi@ ‘punching’. Initially, she disallowed the formation. When asked what the word
would have to mean if it were used,94 she said (paraphrasing), “You’d have to be like Popeye af-237ter he ate spinach”, referring to an almost superhuman continuous blur of punches. After further
reflection she decided the word might be possible to describe the action in a boxing match, although the repetitive BtpTBTp would still be preferred.
6.5.4RepetitiveThe repetitive generally applies only to roots and is formed by the suffix ,(x)` plus repetitive reduplication (symbolized [RepR]), which involves full reduplication of monosyllabic roots with
both the reduplicative vowel and the original first syllable vowel long (346)a,d.95 If the root ends
in a vowel, /Q/ is inserted in the coda of the reduplicative syllable (346)b,e. Polysyllabic roots
have initial CV reduplication with both vowels lengthened (346)c,f. Due to the apocope rule described in §3.4.3, the final vowel of the repetitive suffix in Makah is not evident in surface forms
if it is word final.

Monosyllabic roots in Makah with initial voiced or ejective consonants (including glottal
stop) are subject to the epenthesis rule described in §3.4.3. As usual, insertion of the long epenthetic vowel induces shortening of the initial long vowel.

The repetitive has relatively uncomplicated semantics. It expresses a series of regularly
spaced iterations of an event. Unlike an iterative series (§6.5.5), the series of iterations expressed
by the repetitive typically takes place over a relatively short space of time and requires an agentive subject. In a pattern apparently first noticed by Rose (1981: 278), the repetitive participates in
a type of split intransitivity: stative intransitive roots are transitive in the repetitive, while dynamic intransitive roots remain intransitive. (349) shows several Nuuchahnulth examples.

bHpbHp` ‘speaking’ *‘cause ...’One area that requires further research is the difference in meaning between the continuative
and repetitive aspects with roots like M, N Eh, ‘cut’. In isolation, of course, there is a difference
in translation: with the continuative (M Ehjx@, N Ehx@) this root is translated ‘cutting’ and with
the repetitive form (M EhQHEHx, N EHQEHx`), ‘cutting repeatedly’. In context it is not so clear
what the distinction is. For example, in Makah, ‘she is cutting (the) fish’ is equally well expressed240by either. I examined this issue with speaker HW at some length but was unable to pin down a
difference, although she seemed to feel that there was one.
6.5.5IterativeThe iterative is formed in two ways, which I will refer to as iterative I and iterative II. In some
cases, iterative I and II appear to contrast semantically, but in most other cases, they do not. As an
initial approximation, both can be translated as ‘do X at intervals’. I first describe the formation
of iterative I and II (§§6.5.5.1-6.5.5.2), and then compare their functions (§6.5.5.3).
6.5.5.1Formation of iterative IIterative I involves the suffix ,R (,C after vowels except ,j after /t/ in Nuuchahnulth) plus a
unique iterative I CV template, symbolized [IterR]: full reduplication of a monosyllabic root plus
insertion of /Q/ in the coda of the reduplicative syllable if the root ends in a vowel (350)a,c-e.96 In
a few cases /Q/ is inserted even with consonant-final roots in Nuuchahnulth. Polysyllabic roots
have only the first consonant and vowel reduplicated (350)b,f:

"319When the habitual is followed by the third plural clitic (§7.4.1), which here apparently has the
form <K, metathesis takes place whereby the /j/ of the habitual and the /K/ of the plural metathesize: <`9j<K surfaces as <`9Kj (cf. Jacobsen 1973: 16).
7.4.3Responsive (Makah)<Rh9 (RESP): This clitic indicates that the utterance is made in response to an utterance of the
hearer, generally a question, as demonstrated by the following standard greeting formula:

Second person plural clitics show longer forms with this clitic similar to those that occur with
the habitual: the second plural Set 1 form (see Table 15) becomes <?hbn9v`, and the Set 2 form
becomes <rn9v`.
When the responsive follows the habitual (§7.4.2), the final consonant of the habitual and the
initial consonant of the responsive metathesize: <`9j<Rh9 becomes <`9Rjh9. This metathesis
also occurs when the habitual has already undergone metathesis with the third plural clitic. Thus,
an underlying sequence of <`9j<K<Rh9 surfaces as <`9KRjh9 (cf. Jacobsen 1973: 18).
Jacobsen (1973: 17) reports that the responsive occurs with the Indicative and the Quotative.
Its failure to occur with most of the other moods can be explained pragmatically, e.g. it would be
a contradiction of its function to combine it with either of the interrogatives.","[334, 335]"
"312A definitive statement of the factors determining topicality in Southern Wakashan requires a
quantitative text study, but recency of mention is a relatively clear-cut parameter that will serve to
demonstrate the basic principles at work. In general, the more recently a referent has been mentioned in the discourse, the more topical it is. If the A has been mentioned more recently than the
P, and is hence more topical, it will likely be coded as subject, and the clause will be direct. Conversely, if the P has more recently been mentioned, it will be subject, and the clause will be passive-inverse. For instance, faced with the Makah sentences in (467)a-b out of context, an addressee could interpret either sentence as ‘Bill saw Mary’ or ‘Mary saw Bill’.

Now let us assume that the previous sentence in the discourse was a`ChcF`QFt Bill ‘Bill came in

likely be coded as subject, and the a. translation of each sentence is the most probable.
The second circumstance for the passive-inverse is impersonal reference: clauses with impersonal S/A arguments are often passive-inverse. This impersonal passive-inverse marking is particularly common in the Nuuchahnulth corpus in texts describing how certain rituals are performed. The following example comes from the first two sentences of Text 25, A Secret Ritual for
Spearing Fish (NT 110). The passive-inverse appears three times in this excerpt: in the intransi-313tive clause ‘one goes into the woods’ and the transitive clauses ‘one goes to (his) training place’,
and ‘one makes an imitation canoe with a spear extending out in front’.

Passive-inverse is not obligatory in such procedural contexts. Generally, the first several sentences in a text such as Text 25 are passive-inverse to establish the impersonal S/A in the discourse, but later sentences can be either passive-inverse or direct.
The following example of the impersonal passive-inverse in Makah occurs in a text in which
HI is describing the transparent appearance of a jar in a photograph.

The passive-inverse also regularly appears on the predicate head in both Makah and Nuuchahnulth when a body part is an S/A argument.","[327, 328, 329]"
"1795.3 Classification of suffixes
The 500 or so suffixes can be grouped into a number of categories on the basis of common semantic features and shared grammatical behavior. The broadest classification divides them into
three groups.
1. Formative suffixes, e.g. M ,h9c`, N ,hm, M ,Bhc`, N ,Bhsh
2. Aspect suffixes, e.g. M, N ,`ji ,tj durative imperfective, M, N ,RhQ perfective
3. Lexical suffixes, e.g. N ,LHs ‘son of ...’, M ,dx`W, N ,hx`pG [R] ‘singing ... song’
Formative suffixes are semantically empty suffixes that create the free forms of composite free
roots. Most formative suffixes are used with noun roots. For example, the Nuuchahnulth noun
roots Bhwi`s, ‘eagle’ and Y`xtwi`, ‘cod-fish decoy’ appear as words with the formative suffix
-hm: Bhwi`shm, Y`xtwihm. There are at least two dozen of these formative suffixes. They are discussed in more detail above in §5.2.2.
The dozen or so aspect suffixes make up part of the aspect system, a central grammatical
category in Southern Wakashan. Aspect is described in Chapter 6.
By far the majority of suffixes are lexical suffixes. Lexical suffixes are a Northwest Coast
areal phenomenon that also appears in Salish languages, and Quileute.76 They earned this name
because they have meanings more typical cross-linguistically of open-class lexical morphemes
than closed-class grammatical morphemes. They express a wide range of concepts, and researchers on languages that have them have proposed various semantic classification schemes. Boas
(1947: 236-7) expresses reservations about classifications of this sort on the grounds they impose
categories of the researchers’ languages on the languages of study, but concludes in the end that
they are harmless and descriptively useful as long as it is clear that they make no claim to represent native classifications.","[194, 195]"

"2.2 Vowels
Sapir & Swadesh’s (1939: 12–13) analysis of the vowel inventory is shown in Table 3.5 Symbols
are adjusted to reflect current orthographic practice in the Southern Wakashan descriptive literature (see note 6). Approximate phonetic values (inferred from Sapir’s 1924 phonetic transcription
system and Sapir & Swadesh’s 1955: 3-4 pronunciation notes) are as follows:
h[ι]high front unrounded lax, as in Standard American English (SAE) pitH[hı]high front unrounded tense long, as in SAE Petet[T]high back rounded lax, as in SAE put (but see below)T [tı]high back rounded tense long, as in SAE hoot (but see below)`low central unrounded, as in SAE pot[`]@ [`ı]low central unrounded long, as in SAE fatherdmid front lax, as in SAE pet[D]D [dı]mid front tense long, as in SAE paten[å]mid back lax, as in SAE boughtN [åı]mid back lax long, as in SAE dog13Table 3. Nuuchahnulth vowel inventory
FrontCentralBackHighh HT TMidd Dn NLow` @The high back vowels are actually more open than the cardinal value, having the lip rounding of
the vowel in hoot but the height of the vowel in coat (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 13, 1955: 4).6
The mid vowels in Table 3 are phonemically marginal. Although common on the surface (except the short mid back vowel –– see below), most occurrences are secondary, arising from one of
two sources. First, the long mid vowels /D N/ often appear as ablauted variants of the six basic
(i.e. non-mid) vowels /h H t T ` @/ in emphatic vocative and “calling out” forms (§2.4), and also
in some interjections, e.g.
(1)FD (expressing dissatisfaction)
g`mD ‘hey!’
gD (implying that a statement is true in a surprising way or to a surprising degree)
gNVh (expressing willingness and intention of doing as requested)Second, the mid front vowels /d D/ can result from an umlaut rule that raises and fronts /` @/ to
/d D/ preceding /h H/ with only glottal stop intervening, e.g. s`M` ‘child’, s`MdFhr ‘little child’
(§3.2.1).
Since the ablaut variants /D N/ have functional significance, they must be considered phonemic. There are also a very few occurrences of /d D/ in underlying forms of native vocabulary
(not attributable to umlaut) that support their phonemic status. The short mid front vowel appears
underlyingly (and not from umlaut) in a few interjections and a single root in Sapir & Swadesh’s
(1939: 243-316) list of “primary stems”: jdFDbj`s, or j`bjdFd9s, ‘jump on one leg, hop’. The
long front mid vowel also appears in this root as well as in a few personal names (some of which14may not be of Nuuchahnulth origin), e.g. woman’s name CDF`j`l. The short mid back vowel
/n/ seems to occur only as an allophonic variant of /t/ and is therefore probably non-phonemic.
Vowels show more tendency for allophonic variation than the consonants. There is no complete, systematic account of Tseshaht dialect vowel allophony that I am aware of, but the following allophones can be posited from comments in Sapir (1924) and Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 13).
All vowels are characterized by “a breath-release” in word-final position (Sapir 1924: 84,
note 9). It is not heard when the word is pronounced in close proximity to the next word. Thus,
Sapir (1924: 76) transcribes FhmjFH ‘the fire’ as [Fιm5jgFιg] (transcription normalized; for the
aspiration of /j/ see §2.1; for [5] see §2.3).
The pharyngeal consonants condition another set of allophonic vowel processes. These consonants have certain coarticulatory effects on adjacent high vowels. The pharyngeal fricative /G/
is said to have a “voiceless a-timbre [that] colors and lowers following high vowels” (Sapir 1924:
83, note 3). The examples in (2) show two roots with short high vowels preceded by /G/, both in
phonemic representation (in slashes) and Sapir’s phonetic notation (in brackets).
(2)/Ghr,/ [GDr]
/Gtr,/ [Går]‘blood’
‘salt water’These lowered allophones of the high vowels are tenser than the mid-vowel phonemes in Table 3,
ensuring that we are dealing with an allophonic process here rather than a neutralizing one (cf.
Sapir 1924: 85, note 22).
This “coloring” also affects long vowels, creating what Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 13) refer to
as “pseudo-diphthongs”, e.g. the suffix -`rGT(K) ‘at the chest’ is transcribed by Sapir (1924: 87,
note 44) as [`rG`tK]. In word-final position, however, /H/ is usually [d9] after /G/, e.g. F`sGH
‘night’ is transcribed as [F`sGd9]. Sapir also records the [d9] allophone word-medially in a few
cases: GhGHrrtK ‘bloody-eyed’ is transcribed as [GεGd9rrtK].
Evidently this lowering influence also extends to some preceding high vowels:15(3)/StG,/ [SåG]
/jtG/ [jåG]‘head’
‘hole’(Sapir 1924: 85, note 20)
(Sapir 1924: 87, note 36)Table 4 summarizes the effects of pharyngeals on the high vowels that can be gleaned from
Sapir’s (1924) transcriptions. More study is required to determine the conditioning environments
for those segments listed with multiple allophones, and also to determine whether the gaps in
Table 4 are real or only due to lack of data.

Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 13) speak of “e-glides due to q”. For example, the suffix ,pH ‘on top’ in
F`opH ‘(on) the summit’ is transcribed by Sapir (1924: 87, note 44) as [pdg].","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"1Makah is the usual English rendering of the Clallam (a neighboring Salish language) designation for the tribe. In their own language, the Makah call themselves pihchCC`F@sW and their language piHpiHchCC`p. Both words are regular formations based on the root pihchCC`,p,, a place
designation of uncertain reference (Renker & Gunther 1990: 429). The question of an appropriate
name for the other language appearing in the dissertation is difficult. The traditional name in the
anthropological and linguistic literature, Nootka, is not of native origin and disliked by the
community. In 1978, the Southern Wakashan people of Canada adopted the name Nuu-chah-nulth
(mTC@MtK ‘mountain range’) (Arima & Dewhirst 1990: 410). However, as an ethnonym, this
name actually subsumes peoples speaking two languages, those speaking the language formerly
referred to as Nootka and those speaking the closely related Nitinaht or Ditidaht. I follow Nakayama (1997a, see especially p. 2) in using Nuuchahnulth in a restricted sense as a linguistic designation to refer only to the language formerly known as Nootka. Note that I simplify the spelling
by eliminating the hyphens. Ditidaht is referred to as such.
2
Makah has not been used as a medium of daily communication for decades, and, at the time of
writing, there were only three fluent speakers, all elderly.
3
Interestingly, in phoneme charts given in his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations (1931: 10, 1933: 4),
Swadesh did group /F/ and /Y/ with the glottalized consonants. The latter work agrees with Nootka
Texts in grouping the affricates with the stops, but the former has them listed separately.

Sapir and Swadesh refer to them as “voiced continuants”; Rose and Nakayama call them “resonants”.",[365]
"232Although the graduative typically expresses an imperfective process, it sometimes seems neutral with respect to viewpoint and merely indicates that the process in question is taking place
slowly or gradually. This is probably its original function, in fact. The viewpoint component of
the aspect system as a whole seems to be an addition to, or modification of, an earlier, purely Aktionsart-based system. One apparent clue is a group of roots that do not have a simple perfective,
but only occur with the graduative. Most denote situations that cannot come about instantaneously, e.g. M aTKRhQ, N lTKRhQ ‘high tide’, N sToRhQ ‘evening’.
6.5.2DurativeThe durative aspect suffix M, N ,`ji ,tj (,F`ji ,Ftj after vowels) only occurs with bound
roots (§5.2.1) and a handful of suffixes. The distribution of the allomorphs is unpredictable, but
each root or suffix may only occur with one of the two. The durative has two basic uses:
a) It expresses an intransitive imperfective state:
