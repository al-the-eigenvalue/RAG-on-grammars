These negative strategies conﬁrm the connection between questions and negation in Manambu, corroborating an etymological link between the negative and the interrogative ata
(§14.3).14.7 s ummary
Manambu has a complex system of expressing negation. Only predicates can be negated; and if
a non-predicate constituent has to be negated, this is achieved by making it into an independent
predicate head. A limited variability of the scope of negation is found with the general negator
ma: in non-future declarative clauses only. A summary is in Tables 14.2–3.
Numerous categories are neutralized under negation. These include the following.
(i) Dependent clause types: in positive polarity Manambu has seven types of medial dependent clauses (see §18.1), juxtaposed dependent clauses, and relative clauses; of these, one
(‘unlikely condition’) cannot be negated, and all the rest except for one (the ‘in case’ conditional
clause) are negated in the same way, with the dependent negator -ma:r-.

polarity operates in the language.
(ii) Person, number, and gender are neutralized in declarative non-habitual negative clauses.
Negation is instrumental in providing a distinction between relative clauses, juxtaposed
clauses, and main clauses. In positive polarity, these types are distinguished by intonation only.
Negation distinguishes future from irrealis forms. The existing link between questions
(conceived as underlyingly dependent structures) and dependent clauses surfaces only under
negation.
Three prohibitives diﬀer in their strength, and in a number of morphosyntactic properties
(see Table 14.1). These correspond to just one positive imperative, and a variety of imperative
strategies.
The negation of desiderative involves a marker which is possibly of an interrogative origin.
This may have its basis in a tendency to use questions in lieu of negative structures throughout
the language.","[362, 363, 364]"
"14.1.2 Negation of non-verbal predicates
Non-verbal predicates do not distinguish tenses or aspects characteristic of verbs. To negate a
non-verbal predicate, the negator ma: is postposed to the non-verb stripped of nominal crossreferencing markers. Person, gender, and number distinctions are neutralized under negation—
just as in negative forms of verbal predicates. A negated non-verbal predicate does not distinguish tense (just like its positive counterpart). And the negator can only occur postposed to the
predicate head—this is unlike verbal negative structures where the position of the negator (and
the form of the verb) distinguish non-future and future constructions. That is, postposition
of the negator to the negated predicate has diﬀerent meanings depending on whether we are
dealing with a verb or with a non-verbal predicate head. Scheme 14.2 shows how all person,
number, and gender distinctions are neutralized once a non-verbal predicate is negated.
Consider 14.7. In the negative structure, the head of predicate ‘man’ does not take any
nominal cross-referencing markers, while in the positive structure it takes the nominal crossreferencing for third person singular masculine. The positive and the negative forms are
underlined. Both the negative and the positive non-verbal predicates are tense neutral. Similar
examples are at 10.2, 10.16, and 10.31.

The same negative structure is used for negating existence of something, as in 14.8 and 10.58,
or lack of possession, as in 8.20, 10.6, and 14.9.
14.8 n@k@

14.9 b@r

An alternative to a non-verbal negative possessive structure is a negative version of a clause
containing a positional verb kwa- ‘stay’, as in 7.8 (‘there are no women like this (in) this village’)
and 7.30 (‘I have no betelnut’). The implication is of negating ‘living’, or ‘staying’, or ‘being on
someone’—that is, implying a temporary lack of possession. This is in contrast to structures
like the one in 14.9 which imply permanent lack of possession, or of existence.
Negative attributive verbless clauses have the same structure, as in 13.87, 14.7, and 14.10–12.

We can recall, from §11.2, that when agreeing adjectives (‘small’ or ‘big’) or any other
agreeing modiﬁers from closed classes occur in the predicate slot, they mark agreement with
the subject. In positive clauses, this results in what can be seen as redundant double agreement
in gender with the same constituent. In negative clauses the verbal cross-referencing is omitted
so that only one agreement marker remains—see 14.11–12 (an example of a positive clause
with ‘double’ agreement is at 11.7).

In 14.13, a reduplicated adjective s@mi ‘far’ heads the negative attributive clause. The reduplicated form has the same meaning in a positive and in a negative clause. This is unlike
reduplicated verbs—we will see in §14.3.3 that negating a reduplicated verb root results in a
modal meaning.

cross-referencing or not in positive polarity. The predicate marker is obligatory with manner
demonstratives—which do not take nominal cross-referencing—when they appear in the predicate slot of a positive clause (see §10.2.2); it is omitted from negative clauses:
14.14 ak@tawa ma:
like.this neg
‘It is not like this’
Diﬀerent types of verbless clauses with non-verbal forms as predicate heads are neutralized
under negation (see §20.1.3 on clause types). This agrees with the spirit of dependencies
between grammatical systems: we expect fewer distinctions in negative clauses than in corresponding positive clauses.
The variant ma:n of the general negator appears to be required under one condition: if a
negated clause with a non-verbal predicate is in highlighting focus and the predicate takes
nominal cross-referencing. (It is possible that ma:n is morphologically complex and consists of
ma: followed by the predicative marker -n.) This is illustrated with 14.15, from a story about a
grandmother desperately looking for her grandchildren who were nowhere to be found.

‘It is the case that they were not here, they were not there’
This construction has only occurred in one traditional story. I recorded it three times, with
diﬀerent speakers. Each stretch in square brackets in 14.15 was pronounced as one word, and
repeated twice with a ﬁxed singing intonation. I suspect that focusing clauses with non-verbal
negative predicates is not a productive process, and that 14.15 is a one-oﬀ, archaic structure.
We will see, in §14.5, that focus structures in negative clauses with verbal predicates involve
dependent negation.
Tense, or aspect, can be expressed in a negative clause headed by a non-verb. The non-verbal
form has to be used as the complement of the copula t@- ‘be’ (this form retains its root form t@
when negated). In 14.16, the speaker says that she was not a big girl when the Second World
War came. The non-verbal component, ‘big girl’, is a copula complement of t@- which forms a
non-future negative construction:
[war

‘At that time I was not a big girl, (time when) the war came’
In 14.17, a negated copula clause with the adjective kuprap ‘bad’ as the copula complement
forms a future negative construction:
14.17 kamna:gw kuprap t@
ma:
food
bad
be.neg neg
‘Food won’t be (or become) bad’
A similar example is in T3.43. Copula constructions with the copula t@- and an adjective
as copula complements are ambiguous: they may mean either ‘be adjective’ or ‘become
adjective’; this ambiguity is resolved only through context. For instance, while in 14.17 either14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses303reading is acceptable, in 14.18 only the ‘be’ reading makes sense: the speaker was trying to
persuade her mother to let her go and work in Australia, telling her that Australia is not all
that far away.

To be used in a negative dependent clause, a non-verbal predicate has to be transformed into
a copula complement of the same copula t@-, which is marked with a dependent clause negator,
as shown in 14.19. We return to the negation of dependent clauses in §14.5.

We will see in Chapter 19 that Manambu employs ‘tail-head’, or bridging, linkage as a
device for maintaining discourse coherence. This involves repeating the last verb in a main
clause within a dependent completive clause of the following sentence. If the repeated verb
is negative, it takes the dependent negator when used in a dependent clause. An example of
tail-head linkage involving negation is at 14.113.

in a main clause—see 14.70–1. We can recall, from §9.2, that a clause can take the suﬃx -p@k
‘like’; when negated, the verb takes the subordinate negator -ma:r- which conﬁrms the status
of such clauses as dependent, as in 14.117.

Relative clauses share all the categories with positive main clauses; in fact a positive relative
clause can only be distinguished from a main clause by the lack of intonation break between
the clause and the common argument. Examples of relative clauses—whose predicates are fully
inﬂected verbs—are in curly brackets in 14.113. There are no restrictions on the function of a
common argument in either the main or the relative clause. The only type of relative clause
whose surface realization diﬀers from a main clause involves relativization of the possessor—
see the full discussion in §19.2.
Relative clauses reveal their true nature when they are negated: they require the negator
-ma:r-, just like any dependent clause. As expected, the action focus does not occur in negative
relative clauses, but the habitual -kwa- does. A positive relative clause is given at 14.118a and its
negative equivalent at 14.118b. Further examples of negated relative clauses are at 14.119–21,
and 19.23a–b.

Any relative clause can be used headlessly, and it is negated in the same way. In 14.122, a
headless relative clause is used in A function:32814 Negation14.122 yawi kur-ma:r-dana-di

Juxtaposed clauses which express condition of diﬀerent kinds (see Chapters 18 and 19)
are another dependent clause type which is segmentally indistinguishable from main clauses
unless negated. (Even if not negated, they have a particular intonation contour which indicates
their dependency—see Chapter 19.) When negated, they require the dependent negator -ma:rand thus behave just as dependent clauses are expected to. An example is 14.123—a positive
juxtaposed clause is contrasted to a negative one. The man is telling his wife what to expect of
his trip. Juxtaposed clauses are in curly brackets, and a relative clause is in square brackets.

The distinction between negative future and negative irrealis is neutralized in dependent
clauses: the marking -ma:r-k@- (neg.sub-fut/irr) is used for both. As we saw in 14.56–8,
whether the condition is counterfactual or not can only be decided in the context of a whole
sentence, and by the form of the verb in a main clause.
As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the habitual or repetitive negative meaning in
a dependent clause can be expressed with a negative habitual juxtaposed clause—see 14.124.
In positive polarity, a dependent clause would have been likely to be marked with the suﬃx
-k@b/k@k@b ‘as soon as’ (see §18.6).

be-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘If I do not keep washing (dishes) there will be many (dirty ones)’
That is, any dependent clause is likely to be negated with -ma:r-. Conﬁrmation of this
principle comes from spontaneously introduced innovations, which arise through adopting
code-switches in Tok Pisin to the Manambu system. Consider 14.125. Manambu does not
have a one-word equivalent to the Tok Pisin nogut ‘it is no good that, lest’, and the clausal
complement of this nonce code-switch was reinterpreted as a dependent clause—which can be
seen from the way ‘(that) you will not see’ is negated.

There is just one exception. As mentioned in §13.7, the predicate of the dependent conditional clause introduced by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ is negated with -ma:r-, just as expected.
However, the negator is reduplicated: we can recall that in 13.88 and other positive counterparts
of examples like 14.126 the verbal root, and not any other morpheme, is reduplicated. The
verbal root occurs in its negative form ra:p (the positive form is r@p ‘be enough, ﬁt’) (but note14.5 Negation of dependent clauses329that in 14.160 and 18.52 positive forms of the verbal root are used in similar constructions).
When reduplicated, the negator loses its long vowel.

A similar example is at 14.160 below. That is, judging by the way in which they are negated,
the ‘in case’ clauses stand apart from dependent clauses of all other types.","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356]"
"14.3.2 Negation of same-subject purposive and of desiderative
The same-subject purposive in main clauses and the desiderative are negated with the particle
ata which obligatorily precedes the modal form, and forms an independent phonological and
grammatical word. The negator ata is not used on its own as a pro-clause or a negative
response. The constituent order is ﬁxed: the negator always precedes the verb.
Examples of the negative desiderative are 14.61–2, and the ﬁrst line of 14.65. The negative
desiderative is an uninﬂected verb (just like the positive desiderative), so person, number, and
gender of the subject are not expressed on the verb. If necessary for disambiguation, a personal
pronoun can be supplied, as in 14.61.

14.63 ñ@n

‘You are not going to fall down’
The negator ata does not have to be contiguous with the desiderative or the purposive. A
part of a complex predicate, as in 14.64–5, or a copula complement, as in 7.75, can intervene
between the negator and the verb, if focused. This is similar to the behaviour of the negators
ma: ‘general non-habitual negator’ and ak@s ‘habitual negator’.

‘Having said, “We do not want to study (lit. sit school), we do not want to learn (lit. get

Neither the negative desiderative nor the negative same-subject purposive occur in nonmain clauses. Neither can be negated if used other than as main clause predicates—a diﬀerent
structure has to be used instead.
For instance, neither of the complex predicates involving the auxiliary kur- ‘do/get’ (illustrated in 13.62 and §17.1.2) can be negated using ata. The predicates are negated using ma:
‘general non-habitual negator’ as a separate pro-clause, as illustrated in 14.66–7. There is an
intonation break and a short pause before ma: which is indicative of a clause boundary.

The negative pro-clause negates the whole clause—that is, the desiderative or the samesubject purposive component of the complex predicate cannot be negated separately.
Same-subject purposive in non-main clauses cannot be negated either. The only way of
expressing negative same-subject purpose is by using the general non-habitual negator ma:
as a separate pro-clause.

14.68 [an-a:k
1du-lk+dat hit+purp.ss say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt [pause] neg
‘He came up to hit us—no’
A same-subject purposive used in a main clause can be negated with a pro-clause ma:
following the verb form, in an admonitive sense, as in 14.69 where a mother berates her
daughter for not looking after others.
ma:!
14.69 kur-takak
do-put+purp.ss neg
‘You are not going to look after others (you ought to)’
Just as in 14.67–8, the whole clause is within the scope of ma:. There is no other straightforward way of negating the same-subject purposive without negating the whole clause. To
achieve this eﬀect, the clause has to be rephrased.
In contrast, the diﬀerent-subject purposive can be negated, using the dependent clause
negator -ma:r-, in both main and non-main clauses. We can recall, from §13.4.2, that diﬀerentsubject purposive in a main clause implies that something is to be done following the speaker’s
order. The same holds for the negative diﬀerent-subject purposive, as shown in 14.70.","[339, 340]"
"Scheme 14.2 Negation of a non-verbal predicate: an illustrationA verb marked with a derivational suﬃx -r@b ‘fully’ (§12.8.1) can occur in a negative clause
only if accompanied by the negative form of the same root (see examples of such structures in
positive polarity in 12.42–3). An example is at 14.6. One character is trying to convince another
to cut oﬀ his wife’s breast and put it into a yam soup to make it taste better, assuring him that:

[kiya-r@b kiya ma:] kwasa kiya-k-na
die-fully die neg little die-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Having half-died, having stayed for a little while, she will get up, she won’t fully die, she
will die a little bit’
The verbal derivational suﬃx -d@ka ‘only’ and the completive aspect (see §12.6) do not occur
in negative clauses.",[327]

pastnon-futurefuture ± action focusfuture299Scheme 14.1 Verbal categories in positive and in negative declarative non-habitual verbThe complete involvement of S/O (§12.4) and conﬁrmation marker (§12.5) are not compatible with negation.
Examples of a negative non-future are at 14.1–2 (also see 7.5, 7.8, 7.12a, 7.30, 7.57a, and
T3.31). The past versus non-past reference can be disambiguated with a temporal adverb.
14.1 k@ta ma: t@

‘Now this (custom) does not exist’

‘Then he did not show her cassowary skin to her’
Non-future negative structures form two phonological and grammatical words. The negator
and the verb do not have to be contiguous—see §14.1.3, on the types and functions of discontinuous non-future negatives.
Future negation is illustrated in 14.3–4; the future and the non-future negation of the same
verb are contrasted in 14.3. (Further examples are at 7.15 and T3.43.) Unlike in non-future
negation, no constituent can intervene between the verb and the negator. The two form one
phonological word (they remain two grammatical words, and neither is a clitic), and this is
why a linking @ is required in 14.3:
ma:]
14.3 [ma: ra:p]
[r@p@
neg be.enough/ﬁt.neg be.enough/ﬁt.neg.fut neg
‘It (the T-shirt) does not ﬁt, it won’t ﬁt!’
14.4 [walimaudi-ad]
[wa:l ja
ma:]
rainbow-3masc.sgnom rain fall.neg neg
‘There is rainbow, there will be no rain’
Grammatical relations in negative clauses are marked in the same way as in positive clauses. If
the referent of the subject is not clear from the context, it can be expressed with an overt NP, as
in 7.5. The uninﬂected customary aspect (§12.7) can occur in negative clauses as a complement
of the copula t@-. This is illustrated in 14.5.

This is a grammar of Manambu, a language of the Ndu family, which is, in terms of numbers of
speakers, the largest language family of the Sepik area of New Guinea. Manambu is spoken by
about 2,500 people in ﬁve villages—three of which, Avatip, Malu, and Yambon, are suﬃciently
big to appear on most maps of Papua New Guinea. I started studying the language in 1995,
as part of my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I was interested in learning a
language with shape-based genders. Alan Rumsey was teaching a ﬁeld methods course at
the ANU, with Pauline Agnes Luma Laki as a consultant. I came along to the course, and
then carried on working with Pauline for more than ten years afterwards—this is how my
voyage of discovery started. I have since worked with several dozen speakers of Manambu,
mostly in Avatip. Pauline Agnes Luma Laki and myself are currently engaged in preparing a
comprehensive dictionary of the language.
This grammar contains an analysis of the Manambu language, starting from a brief characterization of the language and its speakers, then going on to phonology, morphology, syntax,
discourse organization, and semantics. The analysis is cast in terms of a cumulative typological
framework of linguistic analysis—which employs ‘the fundamental theoretical concepts that
underlie all work in language description and change’ (Dixon 1997: 128) and in terms of which
signiﬁcant typological generalizations are postulated; this has come to be called ‘basic linguistic
theory’. I have avoided employing any transient formalisms. This grammar is part of genuine
documentation of the Manambu language in its varied facets.
Every chapter of the grammar includes a presentation of the facts of the language interwoven
with arguments for their analysis within a typological framework. No attempt has been made
to separate pure ‘description’ from theoretical interpretation—which would not be a productive
task. A typological perspective for each phenomenon is crucial for the analysis given here.
Detailed exempliﬁcation is provided for every grammatical point. Most examples come
from texts, and a few from spontaneous—or carefully directed—conversation. An additional
objective was to convey as much of the Manambu culture as possible through using naturally
occurring examples. I avoid using elicited sentences; elicitation was limited to lexicon and to
paradigms.
English glosses are kept as close as possible to the glosses and explanations oﬀered by
my consultants. Readers should be warned against trying to draw conclusions concerning
Manambu grammar and semantics from study of the translations.
Examples, tables, diagrams, ﬁgures, charts, and footnotes are numbered separately within
each chapter. Footnotes are also numbered separately for each chapter. The orthography used
in the examples from languages other than Manambu, and language names, follows that of the
sources (unless indicated otherwise).
This grammar can be used as a sourcebook for further typological studies, and as a model
for further grammars of languages of the Ndu and of other families of the New Guinea area.
It is far from being the last word on Manambu—the grammar is intended to provide a sound
systematic foundation for further studies, reanalyses, and reinterpretations.
It is my hope that this book will encourage linguists to go out into the ﬁeld and document
languages threatened by extinction (before it is too late to do so). Nothing can compare with
the intellectual excitement of working out the grammatical system of a previously undescribed
language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

A development of an emphatic form in a negative construction into a negation marker is
typologically well attested. In Manambu, there is no doubt that this is an innovation. Whether
the root sam- is etymologically linked to the quantiﬁer samasa:m ‘many’ (§10.5) is an open
question.
A number of inherently negative forms are used as pro-clauses, that is, as negative responses.
An inherently negative adverb kapi sapi ‘no way’ is used as a negative response and a negative
pro-clause. This could well be an alliterative compound based on the root kapi cognate to the
negator kupu(k) found in numerous Ndu languages. Its variants are sapi kapi or just kapi. I
was told that sapi can also be used this way, but never found an example.
A proximate demonstrative k@ in highlighting focus (ka, kal (dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) or kad
(dem.prox+3masc.sgnom) ) can be used as an emphatic negator, as in 10.24, 18.26, 14.41, and
14.148:
ka!
14.148 vyau
wa-l@-k
hit+1sgimpv say-3fem.sg-compl.ss dem.prox+3fem.sgnom
‘ “Can I hit (it)?”, said (the younger sister), “No!” (said the elder sister)’
This looks like a demonstrative—however, we cannot rule out that this form is in fact a
remnant of a Proto-Ndu negator with the velar ﬁrst syllable, ultimately cognate with kapi.
The negator most frequently used as a negative pro-clause is ma: ‘no’. It is used as a negative
reaction to a command, as in 14.42, or just to contradict a statement, as in 14.86. It is also used
as a negative response to positive questions, as in 14.149, where it is often accompanied by a
negated verb:
14.149 s@r
ya-k-na-d?
ma:, yæy
ma:
tomorrow come-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt No, come.neg neg
‘ “Will he come tomorrow?” “No, he won’t come” ’
To provide a conﬁrmation to a negative question, ayey ‘yes’ is used, as in 14.150 (also see
§4.5.5 and 4.83). This can optionally be accompanied by a negated verb:33414 Negation14.150 ñ@n
ga:n s@

ayey
you.fem night sleep stay-neg.sub-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt Yes
‘ “You didn’t sleep (last) night, did you?” “No, I didn’t (lit. yes)” ’
To refute a negative suggestion, ma: ‘general negator’ or ak@s ‘habitual negator’ is used, as
in 14.151 and 14.51.

‘ “You were not scared (of a plane crash)?” “No, I was scared a lot” ’
The desiderative negator ata is not used this way. The negator ma: is often used to negate
a clause as a whole. It is then postposed to the clause and preceded by a short pause, as in
14.66–8 and 14.152–4.

14.153 m@yir laku-n

An interjection may precede the negator, showing that it constitutes a separate clause:

‘It was not always good way of life’ (lit. it is always good way—this was not the case)
The negator ma: is often used elliptically in any clause type, as in 14.155–6. The habitual
negator ak@s but not the desiderative negator ata can also be used this way—see 14.50 and
14.157.

clause with the negator ma:; see 14.41. The general negator ma: can occur as a complement of
the verb wa- ‘say’, in the meaning of ‘refuse, say no’, as shown in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42.
Like most languages of the world, Manambu has numerous other expressions with negative
meanings, such as wa-t@p- (say-be.closed) ‘forbid’ and wuk@-t@p- (hear/think-close) ‘forget’.
However, such terms are not inherently negative because they can be negated just like any
other verb (see §15.3, on their structure).
A recently introduced inherently negative term tabu ‘taboo, forbidden’, from Tok Pisin, is
often used by those speakers who tend to code-switch. It tends to be accompanied by a negative
command in Manambu, as in 14.158 (partly repeated from 14.74).
14.158 [tabu] [war-tukwa]
taboo go.up-proh.gen
‘It is forbidden, don’t go up’
The dependent clause negator -ma:r appears to participate in the formation of two verbs,
wuk@-mar- ‘forget’ (lit. remember/think-neg.sub) and ya:p s@-mar- (breath plant-neg.sub) ‘be
dead’. Both verbs can be negated, and thus are not inherently negative. There is evidence,
however, that -mar- in ‘forget’ and the negator -ma:r- may be lookalikes and not cognates.
First, the component -mar- in the verb ‘forget’ does not have a long vowel. Secondly, as we
saw in 12.71 (§12.8.2), this component undergoes partial reduplication quite diﬀerent from the
reduplication of the negator -ma:r-. Another example of such partial reduplication meaning
‘fully’ is at 14.159:
14.159 k@k@t@p kui-ku,
d@-k@-m

think-neg.sub.red-?-1pl.subj.p-3fem.sg.bas.p dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg emph
‘Having given (him) the K@k@t@p feast (mortuary feast), this way we have forgotten all
about him’
We saw in §14.5.1 that the negator -ma:r- can undergo reduplication of a diﬀerent sort: an
example of the reduplicated negator used to negate ‘in case’ conditional clauses is at 14.126. A
similar example is at 14.160, where the verb wuk@- ‘hear, listen, think’ is negated this way. The
form wuk@-marmar-@k can mean ‘unless/lest I forget’, or ‘for me not to forget’.
14.160 suku
(k@pa:b) wuk@-marmar-@k
write+1sg.impv in.case think-neg.sub.red-dat
‘Let me write it down lest I might not think (of it)’
That the negator -ma:r- and the component -mar- in what look like verbs with negative
meanings are reduplicated diﬀerently shows that, at least synchronically, they are diﬀerent
forms.
Despite the wealth of negative constructions in Manambu, additional negative strategies
may be employed. As shown in 14.73, questions are often used in negative meanings. In 14.161,
a question implies a negative command: the girl was not supposed to drink too much water
because there was no place for her to go to the toilet:
14.161 toilet yi-k-ñ@na
tami: ak@m-a?
toilet go-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area where-3fem.sgnom
‘Where is the place for you to go to the toilet?","[359, 360, 361, 362]"
"14.3.1 Negation of irrealis and optative
We mentioned in §13.3 and in §12.2 that future and irrealis modality (both marked with the
suﬃx -k@-) are formally distinguished by the way in which they are negated. While the negative
future consists of a verb root followed by the negator ma: (see §14.1.1), the negative irrealis31014 Negationis formed with the negator ak@s (same as the habitual negator discussed in §14.2) followed
by a fully inﬂected verb. The negative irrealis consists of two independent grammatical and
phonological words.
The negative irrealis can be used in main clauses without an overtly stated condition, and
in main clauses (also known as apodosis) in conditional sentences. Examples in main clauses
include 13.35, and 14.52–3. The negative irrealis typically refers to something that could have
happened but did not.

k@p ak@s
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg just neg.irr get.up-irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Then (the war) would not have arisen by itself (without provocation)’
In 14.53 a positive future form is contrasted to a negative irrealis. The future reading of ‘I
will do’ is determined by the context: an irrealis meaning is not appropriate here since this is
what the man is determined to do.

neg.irr in.sloppy.way do/get-irr-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Then in a straight way too I will treat (lit. do) her correctly, I would never treat her in a
sloppy way’
A negative irrealis form in a main clause can express mild commands and wishes, as in
13.37–8. The irrealis in 14.54 expresses a strong wish:
kus t@-k@-k-na-ñ@na!
14.54 ak@s
neg.irr cold have-irr-irr-act.foc-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘May you well and truly not get a cold!’
A negative irrealis in a conditional sentence expresses a counterfactual event—something
that could have happened under a counterfactual condition expressed with a verb marked for
future or irrealis. A clause expressing condition (also known as protasis) is juxtaposed to the
main clause (see §19.1 on juxtaposed clauses).
Examples with a positive clause expressing counterfactual condition with irrealis are at 13.36
and 14.55. In 13.36, we know that the man did not behave as a good uncle ought to have
behaved; hence the irrealis reading of the juxtaposed conditional clause. Similarly, in 14.55, we
know from the story that the magic woman did not give us her magic—if she had, we would
have had a lot of money (which we do not have).

We will see, in §14.5, that the distinction between negative future and negative irrealis is
neutralized in dependent clauses: the marking -ma:r-k@- (neg.sub-fut/irr) is used for both.","[336, 337]"

b@ta:y yaku-na-ñ@n?

the answer ay@y would mean ‘yes, I have’. If I ask 4.83:
4.83 ñ@n
s@
ma: ku?
you.fem.sg sleep neg sleep:neg
‘You didn’t sleep?’
an answer ay@y would mean ‘no, I didn’t’. 9 This form can be replaced with an interjection
ah accompanied with a characteristic facial gesture consisting of a slight raise of eyebrows,
half-closed eyes, and an optional backward head tilt.
The pro-sentence ya:k, or ya:kya (which probably consists of ya:k and the emphatic particle
ya) means ‘OK, ﬁne’ and is a marker of the end of a discourse paragraph, and a pause ﬁller.
A combination of ya:kya as direct speech report slot of the verb wa- ‘say’ and the verb ‘say’
means ‘agree; ﬁnish doing something’ (see §19.5). Speakers who frequently code-switch with
Tok Pisin or English replace ya:kya with orait.
The two declarative negators ma: ‘non-habitual’ and ak@s ‘negative habitual’ can be used as
pro-sentences, that is, as negative answers to questions. A negative can be replaced with a facial
gesture, consisting in a side-to-side head movement. In terms of the verbal form they occur
with, each may be considered a class on its own (see §§14.1–2). The desiderative-purposive
negator ata (see §14.3) is not used as a pro-sentence.
The greeting k@ p@ya:y is a class on its own (see §21.5.3). Syntactically, this is used only as
a greeting, that is a vocative form. It may be related to the address form k@ p, plural k@pugw,
discussed in §4.1.2 above.","[136, 137]"
"14.3 Negation of non-indicative modalities311That is, whether the condition is counterfactual or not can only be decided in the context of a
whole sentence. The form of the verb in a main clause may provide additional clues.
For example, 14.56 is ambiguous as to whether the condition is counterfactual or not: the
main clause form is ambiguous between irrealis and future. Inserting a time word—such as s@r
‘tomorrow’ or nal ‘yesterday’—would have disambiguated this sentence.
14.56 [væki-ma:r-k-la]
go.across-neg.sub-fut/irr-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
[da-k-na-wun]
go.down-fut/irr-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘If she does not go across, I will go down (to meet her)’ or
‘If she had not gone across, I would have gone down (to meet her)’
In contrast, 14.57 can only have a counterfactual reading because of the negative irrealis
form in the main clause.
14.57 [væki-ma:r-k-la]
[ak@s
go.across-neg.sub-fut/irr-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt neg.irr
da-k-na-wun]
go.down-fut/irr-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘If she had not gone across, I would not have gone down (to meet her)’
And 14.58 is not counterfactual since the main clause contains a non-irrealis form:
14.58 [gan@b s@
kwa-ma:r-k@-tua,]
morning sleep lie-neg.sub-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
[sik t@-kwa-na-wun]
sick be-hab-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘If I do not sleep (the next) morning, I usually am sick’
An adverb, a copula complement, or the object of ‘have’ can intervene between the irrealis
negator and the inﬂected verb, as shown in 14.54 and 14.59. In contrast to the habitual negator
ak@s (see, for example, 14.48) inserting more than one-word constituents between the irrealis
negator and the verb results in unnatural expressions.

t@-k@-k-na-di
be/become-irr-irr-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Simon Harrison’s book would not have got bad (if we had proper storage space)’
Just as with discontinuous constructions involving the habitual negator ak@s, the eﬀect is that
of focusing on the constituent which is placed after the negator.
Just like the habitual negator ak@s in 14.50, the irrealis negator can be used elliptically if
the irrealis value is immediately recoverable from the context—this was illustrated in 14.55.
However, it cannot be used as a negative response (unlike the habitual negator in 14.51).
The irrealis negator ak@s is also used to negate the optative modality formed on irrealis, as
in 13.40. Another example is at 14.60: this is a very strong wish for the unwanted guest not to
turn up:
ya-k@-na-d-@u
14.60 ak@s
neg.irr come-irr-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-opt
‘May he not come!!!’31214 NegationNegative optative constructions are rare in discourse. They cannot be discontinuous, and do
not occur in non-main clauses (we recall, from §13.2.3 and §13.3, that the positive optative does
not occur in non-main clauses either). The optative modality formed on ﬁrst and third person
imperatives cannot be negated (see §14.4 for negative imperatives).
Are the two morphemes with the same shape—ak@s ‘habitual negative’ and ak@s ‘irrealis
negator’—the same morpheme or diﬀerent morphemes? Synchronically speaking, they are
better considered as distinct, given that the conditions of their use, their meanings, and
syntactic properties are diﬀerent. Diachronically speaking, the question remains open. It is not
uncommon for irrealis and habitual to be expressed with the same morpheme—as, for instance,
English would. However, since analogy is not a proof, the question concerning any etymological
link between the two forms with the shape ak@s remains open until more comparative data
become available.","[337, 338, 339]"
"14.1.1 Negation of verbal predicates
The general negator ma: negates a verbal predicate of a declarative non-habitual clause. All
person, number, and gender distinctions are neutralized on the verb. We recall, from Chapters
11 and 12, that positive clauses distinguish the past and the versatile tense (which covers near
future, present, and recent past), and also action focus and future. Of these, only future and
non-future are expressed in non-habitual negative clauses. This is shown in Scheme 14.1.
In negative clauses, person cross-referencing suﬃxes which distinguish tense, and the action
focus marker, are omitted. The non-future tense in negative clauses is expressed by preposing
the negator to a special negative form. This form is often the same as the verb’s root, as in wali‘go round’, ma: wali ‘does not/did not go round’. About 50 per cent of verbs undergo vowel
changes described in §11.3.2. These changes are only partially predictable, e.g. gra- ‘cry’, ma:
ga:r ‘does not/did not cry’; g@r- ‘scratch’, ma: ga:r ‘does not/did not scratch’; kur- ‘do/get’, ma:
kwa:r ‘does not/did not do/get’. The origin of these alternations requires further investigation.
Future tense in negative clauses is marked by postposing the negator ma: to the verb root,
as in gra ma: ‘will not cry’, kur ma: ‘will not work’. Neutralization of person, number, and
gender in negative clauses is not unusual: similar examples can be found, for instance, in some
Balto-Finnic languages (see Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998). That positive and negative clauses
have diﬀerent tense distinctions is rather unusual.",[325]
"14.5.2 Negating questions
Negation of questions, content and polar, follows essentially the same pattern as that of
dependent clauses: the verb is marked with the dependent negation -ma:r-. As expected, a nonverbal predicate has to be used as a copula complement of t@- which is then negated with -ma:rin order to be able to occur in negative questions. Just as with any instances of the dependent
negator -ma:r-, the marker usually goes onto a non-future negative stem (see §11.3.2), as shown
in 14.130. However, this is only a tendency (cf. 14.133).
The diﬀerence between negated questions and negated dependent clauses lies in the presence
of interrogative morphemes in content questions (see §10.4) and also in the intonation contour.
Questions have a rising intonation, while dependent clauses have intonation contours of their
own (we return to these in Chapter 20).
In 14.127, a negative content question is followed by a positive one. Other examples of a
negated content question are at 14.128, and 10.107 (‘How come you didn’t see her?’).

negated in the same way.

‘As that woman far away was staying without looking, you did not look after the dogs
properly?’33014 NegationHowever, there are two additional ways of asking a negative polar question. First, many
speakers, in particular young and innovative ones, use negative declarative forms, as in 14.131.
A similar example is at 14.151 below.
14.131 l@ du-a:k
ma: r@?
she man-lk+dat neg sit.neg
‘She didn’t get married, did she?’
And secondly, a desubordinated dependent clause can be used as a polar question. Such
questions frequently have overtones of counterexpectation. At the name debating ceremony
(held on 8 October 2004) I was allowed to sit with the men, record, and take pictures.
Dameliway was keeping an eye on me from the women’s quarters; she was worried that I could
have lost my stringbag, and, at ﬁrst opportunity, rushed to me with a worried question:
14.132 ñ@n
kwasabi ku-su-ma:r-@n?
you.fem stringbag put-up-neg.sub-seq
‘How is it that you are not wearing a stringbag (as I expected you would because you
always do)?’
The speaker who said 14.133 was surprised that there was water left in the bucket:
14.133 aw gu
ata
kus@-ma:r-ku?
then water thus/then ﬁnish-neg.sub-compl.ss
‘Then the water is not ﬁnished (or you haven’t ﬁnished the water)?’
Only some same-subject and non-switch-reference-sensitive sequencing clauses undergo
desubordination. We return to this in §19.9. Positive desubordinated clauses are often used
in commands, and in statements, rather than in questions.
That there is a formal connection between questions and dependent clauses comes as no
surprise to a typologist. It is well known that in many languages questions, both negative and
positive, involve clefts with the surface structure of dependent clauses. That this connection in
Manambu reveals itself only under negation is unusual.","[356, 357]"
"14.1.3 Contiguity in non-future negative constructions, and the scope of negation
In future negative constructions, the verb and the negator are always contiguous, and form one
phonological word. In non-future negative constructions, contiguity is not required. Then the
order of the negator and the verb cannot be reversed: the negator has to precede the negative
verb.
The only form which obligatorily intervenes between the negator and the negated verb is the
adverb n@bay ‘yet, already’, as in 14.20. Any other order is ungrammatical (see 14.20a).
14.20 d@ ma: n@bay yæy
come.neg
he neg yet
‘He has not come yet’
14.20a?? ∗ d@ n@bay ma: yæy
he yet
neg come.neg
‘He has not come yet’—???
The following types of constituents may intervene between the negator and the negative verb
form. The eﬀect is focusing on the intervening constituent. As mentioned in §20.3, individual
constituents hardly ever occur in highlighting focus in negative constructions. Changing their
position in a clause is one way of focusing them.
1. The adjective yara ‘well, ﬁne’ used adverbially can intervene between the negator and the
negated verb, as in 14.21a where ‘well’ is in focus.
14.21a wun ma: yara la:kw
I
neg well know.neg
‘I do not know (this) well (contrary to what you may expect)’30414 NegationIn 14.21b, ‘well’ is not in focus:
14.21b wun yara ma: la:kw
I
well neg know.neg
‘I do not know (this) well’
2. The object can intervene between the negator and the negated verb, as in 14.22–3, with the
object in highlighting focus:
14.22 man-ta:b ma: ap
t@
foot-hand neg bone/force have.neg
‘(His) hands and feet had no strength’
14.23 k@ta wun ma: br@-k@-m
wuk@mar
now I
neg 3du-obl-acc forget.neg
‘Now I haven’t forgotten these two (white people) (despite the fact that we lost touch)’
3. The copula complement can intervene between the negator and the negated verb. In 14.24,
the narrator stresses that people and apawul spirits are not friendly because of a number of
misunderstandings—in contrast, they fear each other:
ma: kapawi t@
14.24 al@k
ñan-awa
this.is.why we-lk+com neg friend be.neg
‘This is why (they) are not friends with us (they are scared of us)
4. The subject can intervene between the negator and the verb. An example of the A of t@‘have’ is at 14.25—this is what a speaker said about her siblings:
ma: ñan t@
14.25 takwa-d@ka
du-a-ma:gw
woman+lk-only man-lk-’thing’ neg we have.neg
‘(We are) just women, we (in contrast to others) do not have brothers’
In 14.26, gu ‘water’, in the S function, intervenes between the negator and the verb:
r@
14.26 ma: gu
neg water sit.neg
‘There was no water (in contrast to what was expected)’
5. An oblique in a locative, or an allative case, can intervene between the negator and the verb,
as in 14.27–8, and T3.14:
14.27 [yæj
k@-na-wur

krakw
14.28 ma: ña:r
neg sun+lk+all take+outside
‘(The two brothers) did not take (their new sister) out into the sun’ (contrary to what
would be expected)
6. A part of complex predicate marked with the sequential -n (see §17.1.1 and §16.2.3) can
intervene between the negator and a posture verb, as a means of focusing on the lexical verb:14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses30514.29 ñan [Malu kwa-na

ma: væn
r@
we Malu stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt sago+lk+acc neg see+seq sit+neg
‘We did not sit watching the sago that was staying at the Malu village’
Examples like 14.21–9 are common to all generations of speakers of all levels of proﬁciency.
In most such cases, the intervening word does not exceed two syllables. An exception is at
14.24—but note that it comes from a story by an elderly man who was trying his best to be as
elaborate as possible.
Only highly elaborate speakers allow a whole clause to intervene between the negator and
the verb. Examples are at 14.30 and 14.31.

‘That dog did not show his face by coming to them two’ (contrary to what they expected)
In 14.31, two constituents intervene between the negator and the negated verb—the adverb
n@bay (for which this is the only possible position) is placed close to the negator, and followed
by a dependent clause ‘like I stay’. The spirit of a dead woman refuses to give her living husband
the food she eats in the world of the dead:
ma:,

you.masc neg yet
‘I won’t give you these ﬁsh, those shrimp, you are not yet in the same state as I am
(contrary to what you may think)’
There is an intonation break between ma: n@bay ‘not yet’ and the rest. This is not surprising:
ma: n@bay behaves like a ﬁxed expression.
If a multiword complex predicate consists of an inﬂected auxiliary and an uninﬂected part
(see Chapter 17), the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate intervenes between the negator
and the inﬂected part. This is shown in 14.32.
t@
14.32 d@ væy ma: warya-n
he spear neg quarrel/ﬁght-seq have+neg
‘He hadn’t fought with spear’
To focus the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate, this has to be preposed to the negator.
Note that the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate cannot follow the negative form of the
auxiliary—this is in contrast to uninﬂected verbs which are not part of complex predicates
(§17.1–2). In 14.33, the speaker focuses on the fact that she had never ever seen European-type
long hair (she had heard of this, but this was her ﬁrst-time visual experience):
nab [ñ@n-a
14.33 wun tala:b væ-n ma: t@
I
before see-seq neg have.neg hair you.fem-3fem.sgnom
t@-na-p@k]
have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-like
‘I have never before seen hair like you have’
Complex predicates consisting of a nominal and a verb are negated just like other complex
predicates in 14.32: the whole complex predicate follows the negator, as in 14.34–5:30614 Negation14.34 wun ma: s@kul@k y@
I
neg cooking do/go
‘I didn’t do the cooking’
ma: j@b@ kwa:r
14.35 wun k@
t@pa:m
I
dem.prox village+lk+loc neg image do/get+neg
‘I didn’t learn to write (lit. get image) in this village’
The position of negator and the eﬀect of reversing the order of the nominal, or the
dependent-marked verb, and the negated verb help diﬀerentiate superﬁcially similar complex
verbs containing auxiliaries (as in 14.33–5) and sequencing structures (as in 14.29).
In none of the examples discussed above does the change in the position of the negator
aﬀect the scope: the negator consistently has the whole clause within its scope. There is just
one exception. The adverb m@yir appears to be unique in that the scope of negation diﬀers
depending on its position in a clause. In 14.36, m@yir ‘really’ precedes the negator, and the verb
is within the scope of negation.
14.36 a-di
ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw
m@yir ma: la:kw
dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman really neg know.neg
‘Other people really do not know those stories’
In 14.37, this same adverb intervenes between the negator and the verb. Either the verb or
the adverb can be understood as being within the negator’s scope. The ambiguity is resolved
by context.
ma: m@yir la:kw
14.37 a-di
ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw
dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman neg really know.neg
‘Other people do not really know those stories’ or ‘Other people really do not know
those stories’
Manambu has no negative pronouns. The numeral ‘one’ in its indeﬁnite meaning is used in
negative clauses, meaning ‘not one’, as in 12.7 (nak-a:b@ ma: y@ (one-too neg go) ‘not one
escapes’), and T3.14 where the form nakam@y ‘single one (feminine)’ is used.
If a constituent other than the predicate is to be negated, it has to form an independent nonverbal clause negated by ma:. To say ‘not only in Avatip’ one literally says ‘only in Avatip—no’,
as in 14.38. The non-verbal negative clause is in square brackets.

A negative non-verbal clause can occupy the same position as a noun phrase. For instance,
the word for ‘bald’ is nab ma: t@- (hair neg have). How this term was used is shown in 14.39
(an example of the argument elaboration construction: §6.2.3). That ma: ‘negator’ forms one
constituent with nab ‘hair’ and not with the verb t@- ‘have’ is evident from the form of the14.2 Negation of habitual clauses307verb: it is inﬂected as a positive, and not as a negative verb. A negative form of t@- is shown
in 14.40—this sentence was used to describe a girl who is not bald, but whose hair had been
shaved because of lice. (Constituency is indicated with square brackets.)
14.39 [an
Bob wuk@n] [nab ma:] t@-na-bran

‘We two, Bob and I, are bald’ (lit. we have there-is-no hair)
14.40 nab [ma: t@]
hair neg have.neg
‘She has no hair’
Negating one constituent as a separate non-verbal clause produces the eﬀect of strong
contrast. One sister is saying to the other: ‘We two will eat that sago with coconut’, and the
younger sister replies 14.41:
ma:, bal-awa
14.41 ka!
t@p-a:wa
dem.prox+3fem.sgnom coconut-lk+com neg pig-lk+com
k@-k@-ta
eat-fut-1dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘ “That? (meaning: no way!), not with coconut, we will eat (sago) with pork!” ’
A similar example is at 10.145 (‘few, not many, few people went down (river)’).
As we will see in §14.6, the negator ma:—unlike any other negator—can be used as a
complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ with the meaning of ‘forbid, negate, refuse’. This is illustrated
in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42. In such constructions the verb wa- remains inﬂected as required. The
second occurrence of ‘say no’ is negated in the last line of 14.42.

‘ “Across there they will refuse (say no) to me getting ﬁre.” “No, go out, they won’t

This example also illustrates another usage of ma:—that of a general negative pro-clause.
We return to this in §14.6. Inherently negative lexemes (see §14.6) co-occur with clausal negator
ma:. They do not have the same scope eﬀects as does ma:. Neither do other negators.14.2 ne gat i o n o f h a b i t ua l c lau s e s
Habitual clauses (which require the verb in habitual aspect marked with the suﬃx -kwa‘present’, -yikwa- ‘past’: see §12.3) are negated with the negator ak@s which occurs with the
verb in habitual aspect (marked with the suﬃx -kwa-). Unlike the general negator, ak@s cooccurs with fully inﬂected verbs, as in 14.43–4, 10.5, and 10.60. The negative habitual refers to
what is typically not done.

predicate head:
14.44 yabi:b ak@s
kuprap t@-kwa-na-di

stay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘They do not become bad quickly’
We can recall, from §4.2.2, that the verb kui- ‘give to third person’ is quite unusual in that it
has two alternative forms of the negative habitual. Unlike other verbs in the language, it does
not have to take the suﬃx -yikwa- ‘past habitual’ in the past negative form. Two options are
thus available for ‘give’ in past habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The
regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not) give habitually’, is shown in 4.37 and 14.45:
14.45 ak@s
kui-yikwa-l
d@-k@
ta:kw
neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab.past-3fem.sgbas.p he-obl+fem.sg wife
‘She never used to give (them food), his wife’
The alternative non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s, is shown
in 4.38 and 14.46. Within the same story, 14.45 and 14.46 follow each other.

A negative construction containing the negator ak@s and an inﬂected verb forms two grammatical and two phonological words. A habitual negative construction with ak@s does not have
to be contiguous. In 9.21 the copula complement precedes the construction of ak@s followed
by an inﬂected verb, and in 14.44 the copula complement is positioned between the negator
and the inﬂected verb. The eﬀect of inserting a constituent between ak@s and the inﬂected
verb is essentially the same as that in constructions with the non-future negative structures
involving the declarative non-habitual negator ma: (see §14.1.3 above): the inserted constituent
is in highlighting focus.
In fact, any constituent, except for subject or object, can intervene between ak@s and the
inﬂected verb. In 14.47 gus ‘paddle’ is part of a complex predicate involving a typical instrument
(see §7.2).

In 14.48, a series of dependent clauses intervenes between the negator and the inﬂected verb:
these clauses contain information which is contrary to what is expected of the river-dwellers:

occur with n@bay ‘yet’. An anterior complex predicate involving the habitual form copula t@and a sequential form of a verb is preceded by ak@s as shown in 14.49 (a non-habitual negated
anterior complex predicate is at 14.32). Any alternative ordering of ak@s and the inﬂected verb
in such structures appears contrived.

The negators ma: and ak@s share some similarities in terms of contiguity in negative constructions; but are not identical in their properties. Unlike ma:, the negator ak@s is not used
to negate non-verbs on their own—that is, without a copula (see 14.44). Consequently, it is
not used to negate a nominal constituent in the way ma: is employed (see 14.41). Neither is it
used as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’. The negator ak@s can be used elliptically, meaning
‘never’: in its second occurrence in 14.50, ‘never’ is an elliptic clause recapitulating the previous
clause:

‘This salt of ours they would never throw (into their food), never, never ever would they
throw (salt in their food)’
The general non-habitual negator ma: and the habitual negator ak@s are both used as proclauses in elliptical replies—see 14.51 and 14.42.

ak@s
14.51 ñ@n

‘ “Do you usually smoke?” “Never!” ’
Further similarities and diﬀerences between ma: and ak@s are addressed in §14.6.
The same negator, ak@s, is used to negate irrealis in main clauses, and in counterfactual
conditional clauses, and to negate the optative mood—this is the topic of the next section.14.3 ne gat i o n o f n o n- i n d i c at i v e m o da l i t i e s
All of the non-indicative modalities discussed in Chapter 13 can be negated, with the exception
of the frustrative. Irrealis and optative, on the one hand, and same-subject purposive and
desiderative, on the other, are negated in the same way (§§14.3.1–2). Diﬀerent-subject purposive
is negated in the same way as any verbal predicate in a non-main clause—see §14.3.2 and §14.5.
The negation of nominalizations as predicate heads is addressed in §14.3.3.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"

Unlike any other command, negative or positive, a third person negative imperative can
occur marked as highlighting focus. A girl strongly prohibits her paternal uncle and his children
from coming into the house, since they had mistreated herself and her brother when they were
little. Her statement contrasts with what her brother has to say.

close to you’ (said the girl to her brother)
An alternative form of the -ba- third person negative imperative contains an additional syllable -k@- between the person-gender-number marker and the suﬃx -ba-. An example is in 14.105:
the bush baby (referred to in 14.94) is not to take oﬀ his grass skirt, under any circumstances.
The negative imperative is in highlighting focus: what he is not to do is contrasted to what
other boys do—that is, wash naked.

‘It is the case that he is not to wash having untied the grass skirt, he should wash with

The two alternatives, with and without -k@-, appear to be identical in meaning and use. The
absence of -k@- in forms quoted in 14.102–4 can be explained as a result of intervocalic -klenition (see A3 in §2.6). The only problem with this explanation is that in all clear cases of
intervocalic -k- lenition, k is invariably supplied in careful speech register. In contrast, the two
alternative forms of the third person negative imperative occur in all speech registers. The third
person negative imperative is rare in discourse. Young and innovative speakers know the forms,
but hardly ever use them.
What they use instead is an innovative third person imperative construction consisting of the
verb stem followed by the dependent clause negator -ma:r- and then by third person imperative
markers (listed in Table 13.1). Such commands do not have a strong overtone of negative
obligation—their meaning is that of a negative command to third person. A mother told her
eldest daughter not to let a younger daughter wear dirty trousers to church:32414 Negation14.106 kusu-ma:r-kwa
wear-neg.sub-impv.3p+fem.sg
‘May she not wear (this)’
A wish that an unwanted guest should not come was spontaneously phrased as:
14.107 ya-ma:r-kwa-d
come-neg.sub-impv.3p-masc.sg
‘May he not come!’
Such forms can also be used to express indirect causation, as in 14.108. This was said as an
explanation of why I had to use a hairclip:
14.108 l@-k@
nab kay-gwaj-@n
t@-na-d
she-obl+fem.sg hair manip-wrap-seq stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
væker-ma:r-kwa-d
fall-neg.sub-impv.3p-masc.sg
‘It (hairclip) wraps her hair, so that (the hair) should not fall down’
These forms are used in everyday speech by speakers of all ages—but they are condemned
by some speakers, especially those puristically oriented, as ‘non-existent’ and ‘wrong’. Given
that older and traditional speakers consider them wrong, I hypothesize that they constitute a
recent innovation. We will see, in §14.5.3 below, that the subordinate negator -ma:r- can be used
in main declarative clauses if they refer to a wish, or if the clause is in focus. The meaning of
‘wish’ is consistent with the third person command; and it is likely that third person imperative
markers were added to the -ma:r- form by analogy.
One cannot exclude, however, that this seemingly innovative negative imperative is in fact an
archaic form. We will also see, at the end of §14.5, that the negator -mar-ék marks negative
commands in Wosera (Wilson 1980: 164–5). If the markers in Manambu and Wosera are
related, the negative imperative use of Manambu -ma:r- may be a retention rather than an
innovation.14.5 ne gat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e s, q u e s t i o n s,
a n d f o c u s s t ru c t u r e s
Dependent clauses are negated with the negator -ma:r- which follows the verb stem. If the
verb stem undergoes vowel changes in a non-future negative form (as outlined in §11.3.2), the
non-future negative form is preferred, e.g. kur- ‘do/get’, negative ma: kwa:r ‘do(es) not/did not
do/get’, dependent negative kwa:r-ma:r-, k@l- ‘dry (of water)’, ma: ka:l ‘do(es) not/did not dry’,
negative dependent ka:l-ma:r- (also see the ﬁrst line of 14.55, with the form kwa:y- ‘negative
non-future give.to.third.person’). There is a tendency to reduce either the root vowel, or the
aﬃx vowel, so as to avoid having two long vowels in one phonological word (in agreement
with §2.5.1). That is, variants kwar-ma:r- (rather than kwa:r-ma:r-) and ka:l-mar- (rather than
ka:l-ma:r) are not uncommon.
However, many speakers use a non-negative form, as is the case in a headless relative clause
in 14.122. Those who prefer the negative form are typically innovative ‘big men’; while women,
who are more traditional speakers, tend to use the non-negative form.
The negative dependent marker -ma:r- is used in three basic contexts: to negate the predicate
of a variety of types of dependent clause (§14.5.1), to negate the predicate of questions (§14.5.2),14.5 Negation of dependent clauses325and in independent clauses, among them the ones expressing wishes and laments (§14.5.3). That
the three clause types are negated in the same way indicates similarities in their underlying
structure.
The marker -ma:r- is compatible with the future and the non-past habitual -kwa- (see 14.58,
14.118, and 14.124) in juxtaposed clauses, causal clauses, and relative clauses. (The actionfocus -na-, the future, or the optative modality are not used in any of these.) In all other
clauses, -ma:r- occurs with whatever clause-chaining aﬃxes are appropriate. The negative
clauses preserve the same speciﬁcations as the corresponding non-negative clauses. That is,
diﬀerent-subject clauses keep their subject cross-referencing in positive and in negative forms
(see 14.19, 14.112, and 14.113), and same-subject clauses have none in either (as in 14.111).
A non-negative uninﬂected predicate remains uninﬂected if negated, as does the manner
sequential form (14.109), the cotemporaneous form (14.114), and the immediate sequencing
form (14.115).","[349, 350, 351, 352]"
"14.4.1 Non-ﬁrst person negative imperatives
There are three forms with negative imperative meaning, used predominantly with second person reference, and also sometimes with third person reference: the general negative imperative
marked with the suﬃx -tukwa, and two strong prohibitives, -way ‘strong’ and -wayik ‘extrastrong’.
A. The general prohibitive is marked with the suﬃx -tukwa forming one phonological word
with the root (and therefore requires an automatic @ after a verb root ending in a consonant
to avoid non-authorized consonant clusters). It always bears a secondary stress on its ﬁnal
syllable, e.g. wuk´@-tukwà (hear/listen-proh.gen) ‘do not listen’, bas s´@-tukwà ‘don’t ask’.
Unlike any other verbal aﬃx, -tukwa can be used with the free form jau ‘let it drop, let it
be’, as in jau tukwa, lit. ‘don’t let it drop’, in the meaning of ‘there is no reason to drop this;
this is important; there is no reason to say jau’ (see §4.5). Such structures are not frequent, and
may be analysed as ‘echo constructions’, because they appear as a reaction to someone saying
jau in the ﬁrst place. The form jau, frequent with positive imperatives, is otherwise not used in
prohibitions.
Just occasionally, tukwa may be used as a prohibitive ‘don’t’ on its own. This is found in
abrupt elliptical speech. These usages may well be an innovation, due to the fact that -tukwa
is disyllabic and requires secondary stress. Alternatively, they may reﬂect an older usage, and
perhaps even provide justiﬁcation for tracing -tukwa to an independent verb—see the end of
this section. No other prohibitive can be used this way.
The general negative imperative typically refers to second person, as shown in 14.84–6, and
also 4.58, 13.16, 14.18, and 14.62.

14.84 wali

Since the negative imperative does not encode person distinctions, a pronoun can be added
for disambiguation, as in 14.85, and 14.86.
14.85 m@n
kayk@t@-tukwa
you.masc. hang.on/touch-proh.gen
‘Don’t you touch (my bow and arrow)’
The personal pronoun can follow the verb, if contrastive, as in T3.7. A general prohibitive is
often accompanied either by an instruction on what to do instead of what is being prohibited
(as in 14.93), or by a statement of the consequences, as in T3.7 and 14.86 (a continuation of31814 Negation14.6). This is similar to the situation described for Dyirbal and other Australian languages by
Dixon (1972: 112).

‘This is why don’t you worry (lit. you inside don’t worry), having said “She has died
already”, no, she will get up’
A prohibitive can be formed on complex predicates, including physical and mental
state constructions (discussed in Chapter 17), as in 14.86 and 14.87a. The corresponding
declarative constructions are at 14.87b and 14.87c: the diﬀerence between these two is in the
focus on the experiencer in 14.87c.
14.87a mawul war-tukwa

14.87c (wun) mawul
inside/mind go.up-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
I
‘I am excited’ (lit. I go up (with respect to) my inside)’
The prohibitive in 14.87a may be interpreted as having third person reference, with a literal
translation ‘may the inside not get excited’, or as having second person reference, ‘may you
not get excited with respect to your inside’. Such constructions are hardly ever used in positive
imperatives. They cannot form second person imperatives, because non-volitional verbs and
states are mutually exclusive with second person imperative (see §13.2.1–2). Theoretically,
they could form third person imperatives—that is, a construction like 14.87d would be grammatically acceptable, but culturally questionable. It is in fact not culturally appropriate to
be in a state describable as ‘inside goes up’: this state covers excitement, anger, and further
uncontrollable strong feelings which are considered improper:
14.87d mawul war-kwa
inside go.up-impv.3p+fem.sg
‘May (second/third person) be excited’—?
We will see in §20.1.4 that mawul here is not a direct object: under no circumstances can it
be cross-referenced on the verb. We return to the concept of mawul in §21.4.
A general prohibitive can be directed at humans and high animates. In Mali’s family, it is not
uncommon to address inanimate objects with a general prohibitive. In 14.88, Mali was berating
her cooking pots for being lazy and not getting the food cooked quickly enough:
yi-tukwa
14.88 kwas-@k
small-lk+dat go/say-proh.gen
‘Don’t be unwilling!’
And Tanina, her eldest daughter, instructed a piece of watermelon which was rolling oﬀ the
edge of the ﬂoor:14.4 Negative imperative31914.89 piñu-tukwa
slide-proh.gen
‘Don’t slide!’
No positive imperative was used this way. Neither can any other prohibitive be addressed to
an inanimate object.
Unlike the other two non-ﬁrst person negative imperatives, the general -tukwa hardly ever
has obviously non-second person reference. The interpretation of examples in 14.86–87a as
having a third person addressee is possible, but unlikely: they are obviously addressed to
a person, and not to their inside. A prohibition marked with -tukwa can occasionally be
addressed at a third person—an inanimate force, as in 14.90:
an
yi-ya:k
14.90 wa:l ja-tukwa
rain rain-proh.gen we.du go-red+dat
‘May the rain not fall, we two would like to go’ (to a ceremony)
When used in the direct speech report slot, a -tukwa prohibitive is a way of marking
negative purpose, with non-ﬁrst subject reference. This is a usage not attested with any other
prohibitives:
14.91 [wuk@mar-wuk@mar-tukwa] wa-na-wun
forget-red-proh.gen
say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am telling (you) so that this should not be forgotten (or: so that you should not fully
forget)’ (lit. I say ‘do not fully forget’)
As mentioned in §13.2.2, the general prohibitive of wa- ‘say’, wa-tukwa, has an additional
meaning of ‘say it again, I couldn’t agree more’. This is an idiomatic usage which is not shared
with any of the other prohibitives.
B. The strong prohibitives are marked with the suﬃxes -way and -wayik which form one
phonological word with the verb stem to which they attach. Neither suﬃx can be used on its
own, or accompany jau ‘let it drop, let it be’ on its own, unlike the general prohibitive -tukwa.
All monosyllabic verbs and a few other verbs require a formative -k- in the strong prohibitive
(see §11.3.2), e.g. wa-k-wayik ‘do not ever say’, k@-k-wayik ‘do not ever eat’.
The two strong prohibitives diﬀer from the general prohibitive in their illocutionary force.
For instance, if a mischievous child is told 14.92a, it is likely that she will pay no attention and
wait and see what happens next.
ñ@n-a-k@-l
ma:
14.92a kur-tukwa
do/get-proh.gen you.fem-lk-obl-fem.sg neg
‘Do not take (this), it is not yours’
A parent who is really annoyed and does not want the child to keep on reaching out for what
is not hers is likely to shout:
14.92b kur-way!
neg-proh.str
‘Do not take (this)!!’
On saying this, a parent is likely to get hold of something heavy to throw at the child. The
child gets a bit edgy, preparing to start running away; and she is likely to stop what she was
doing. If she does not, or the parent is not satisﬁed with the eﬀect, 14.92c follows:32014 Negation14.92c kur-wayik!
neg-proh.extra
‘Do not take (this)!!!’
On hearing this, the child is oﬀ in a ﬂash—she knows for a fact that the parent is well and
truly annoyed, and will hit her if she does not disappear.
The two strong prohibitives are similar in their behaviour. We saw above that the general
prohibitive is very often accompanied by a statement of what may happen otherwise, as shown
in 14.86 and 14.93 (partly repeated from 7.21):
14.93 [ [a

‘Having seen the tree (whose leaf I put on the ground), do not go on that road, go straight
onto the road on the right-hand side’
In contrast, a strong prohibitive often occurs unaccompanied by such statements. Strong and
extra-strong prohibitions are likely to occur on their own—they are so strong that the addressee
is supposed to be aware of the consequences anyway. Or the consequences of disobedience may
be such that the speaker does not want to stress them. Example 14.94 is a strongish prohibition:
a bush boy has to wear a grass skirt at all times.
l@pa-way
14.94 ak@tawa kwa:r
like.this grass.skirt break-proh.str
‘Don’t you ever undo (break) your grass skirt’
In 14.95, the spirit instructs the woman to never ever look inside her stringbag. She disobeys
and the consequences are disastrous—her little son becomes a monster:

‘Never ever look down into this stringbag, do not ever look by opening it sideways’
A reason for the prohibition, but not the consequence, can be stated; however, this has only
been attested with the strong, but not the extra-strong, prohibitive:

‘Do not cut this tree, my wife is sitting up there having a baby’
Either of the strong prohibitives can be accompanied by an inherently negative form
s@m@rab, s@ma:b, or s@ms@ma:b ‘never ever’, as in 14.95 (see §14.6). Neither can have an
inanimate addressee, in contrast to the general prohibitive. Strong prohibitives are not used
with verbs of mental states—the general prohibitive is preferred in such contexts (14.86–7).
Either of the strong prohibitives may refer to a third person, much more frequently so than
the general prohibitive -tukwa. We also saw, at 14.90, that -tukwa may be used with a nonhuman third person agent. In contrast, a third person with either of the strong prohibitives14.4 Negative imperative321always has a human referent. In 14.97, the third person is explicitly stated, and in 14.98 it
was understood from the context. A taboo stated with a negated nominalization in 14.97 is
reinforced with the prohibitive, to make sure the audience understands the strength of the ban.

Apprehensive usages of the strong prohibitives express a highly undesirable consequence of
a previously ﬁnalized action described with a dependent clause.
Either of the two strong prohibitives can be used as a causative strategy, mirroring the similar
usages typical of the positive imperatives (see §13.2.2, examples 13.23–5):

‘Do not you tell me to cook here!’ or ‘Don’t make me cook there!’
The properties of the two strong prohibitives and of the general prohibitive are contrasted
in Table 14.1.
Table 14.1 shows that, besides the diﬀerences in the strength of a prohibition (illustrated in
14.92a–c), the three prohibitives diﬀer in their morphosyntactic properties, and in actual usage.
Languages of the world tend to have fewer prohibitives than they have positive imperatives
(Aikhenvald forthcoming a); there are, however, a few languages where more distinctions are
expressed in negative than in positive commands. Manambu is one such example: there are
three prohibitives, with just one positive counterpart. The positive imperative is richer than
the negative imperatives in just one respect: ﬁrst person imperative only exists in the positive
polarity. However, the seeming scarcity of positive imperative forms is compensated for by a
large array of command strategies—see Table 19.5 in §19.9.
The etymology of the three prohibitives is unknown—there are no clear cognates of any of
these in any of the Ndu languages. We hypothesize that the form -tukwa may be derived32214 NegationTable 14.1 The properties of three non-ﬁrst person prohibitives: a comparison

(Note that, as shown in §2.1.2, t@kwa is an alternative realization of tukwa.) This etymology is corroborated by typological analogy—noninfrequently, prohibitives come from expressions like ‘stop, let it be, leave it’ (Heine and Kuteva
2002; Aikhenvald forthcoming a; and similar developments suggested in Dixon 1972: 112).
The strong prohibitive marker -way- is homonymous with the inherently reduplicated form
wayway ‘maybe, posssibly’. The component way- also occurs in the interjection wayay, wayey
‘oh dear’; but any etymological connection with the prohibitive is dubious.
The formative -ik in -wayik may well be related to the conﬁrmation marker -@k (see §12.5;
and note that @ is pronounced as [i] in the context of a palatal glide y: see §2.1.2), given that the
strong negative imperative -way diﬀers from -wayik in the degree of strength, or ‘assertiveness’.","[344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"

‘I will tell another story straight away. So it is (life story) I will tell, I will tell (it)’
The reduplicated -k@- is never used with the verb k@- ‘consume (eat, drink, smoke)’: so, a form
like ∗ k@-k@-k@-bana (eat-fut-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) is ungrammatical, and k@-k@-bana
would always be used instead in the meaning of ‘we will eat (it)’. This may also be due to a rule
of loss of a voiceless velar stop discussed at A3 in §2.6.
The future is homophonous with irrealis (§13.3). In positive clauses, the two meanings are
distinguished solely by context. But, as we will see in §13.3, the future and the epistemic, or
irrealis, meanings are formally distinguished under negation: ku-sada ma: means ‘she won’t
put’, and ak@s ku-sada-k-la means ‘she might not have put; she would not have put’ (§14.1.1
and §14.3.1). This suggests that synchronically there are two morphemes -k@-: one is marking
future, and the other one marking irrealis (§13.3).
An example of an irrealis form is at 12.13. This was said as an explanation for why the little
girl woke up in tears. A future interpretation would not make sense here.

A future and an irrealis in a main clause can be ambiguous: for instance, 12.14 can mean

The overtones of future and irrealis in juxtaposed clauses are discussed in §19.1.12.3 ha b i t ua l a s p e c t
The habitual aspect is the only aspect which consistently combines with a fully inﬂected
verb. It can co-occur only with the versatile tense cross-referencing, and has the following
properties:r It has two forms: non-past tense marked with the suﬃx -kwa, and past marked with -yikwa-. The semantic distinction is that of non-past versus past—this is in contrast to the
diﬀerence between the past tense and ‘versatile’ tense in non-habitual clauses which covers
recent past, recent future, and present, and is also used in vivid narratives.
r The non-past habitual can occur with the action focus marker, as shown in 12.17.
r The habitual is negated with the particle ak@s which, unlike the non-habitual declarative
negator, occurs with a fully inﬂected verb. The same categories can be expressed in positive
and in negative habitual clauses. In contrast, negative declarative non-habitual clauses12.3 Habitual aspect259require the negator ma: accompanied by a non-inﬂected form of the verb with no person,
gender, or number distinctions (§§14.1–2).
r The habitual aspect does not combine with future: a future habitual meaning can only be
expressed with a complex predicate involving the verb kwa- ‘stay’ (12.20–1).
The habitual marker could be etymologically related to the polyfunctional verb kwa- ‘stay’
(see §17.1.1 on its use as auxiliary in aspectual complex predicates with the meaning of
prolonged durative). Synchronically, however, the habitual diﬀers from verb compounding
structures since (i) it is negated in a unique way, (ii) its past form involves an additional marker
-yi-, and (iii) it only takes the versatile tense cross-referencing markers.
The past habitual marker could be related to the verb yi- ‘go’ or the copula verb yi- (the two
are distinguished in the ways they form imperative: see §4.2.2), or to neither of these.
Unlike the verb kwa-, the habitual does not form an imperative, or combine with any further
modality speciﬁcations. The irregular negative habitual form of the verb ‘give’ was illustrated
in 4.38 (also see 4.37, for a regular one).
The habitual aspect describes usual activities, as in 12.15. The versatile tense form refers to
activities not restricted to any time frame, and is frequent in generic statements, with or without
the action focus marker:

Along similar lines, 12.16 states what the snake used to do. Fish are the topic, and this is why
they have to be cross-referenced on the verb:
12.16 kami: d@ k@-kwa-da-di

‘He (the snake) used to eat ﬁsh’
In a vivid narrative about her experience living with an Australian couple, the speaker used
the non-past habitual marked with action focus, so as to highlight what her foster parents used
to do:

‘Harold, he always used to eat food, too, those sugarcane, pineapple, banana, he used
to eat things like fruit, together with his wife Kay. They then treated me correctly, like

The past habitual refers to usual activities restricted to the time before the speech act, which
are no longer relevant for the present. The usual activities described in 12.18 ended just after
Australians occupied the Sepik area:26012 Verbal Categories12.18 aw kr@l

‘They then used to go down the river here’
In 12.19 the past habitual—used in a relative clause—refers to something that is no longer
there (we will see in §14.5 and §19.2 that relative clauses have all the speciﬁcations of a main
clause, unless negated; in cases like this one they can be distinguished from juxtaposed main
clauses by intonation only).

A negated form of the habitual aspect is illustrated in 7.16 (also see §14.2). A future habitual
meaning can be expressed by a complex predicate consisting of the lexical verb marked with
the sequencing manner suﬃx -n and the verb kwa- ‘stay’ marked for future, as in 12.20. Such
examples may have an additional connotation of ‘staying in a place’ (rather than moving), due
to the primary meaning of the verb ‘stay’.

‘You get (shrimp), I will keep taking care (of the baby)’ or
‘You get (shrimp), I will stay taking care (of the baby) (rather than move)’
If the context excludes the connotation of ‘staying in a place’, the reading of such constructions is habitual. In 12.21, the sorceress is expected to keep going back and lighting a ﬁre. There
is no connotation of ‘staying’—the verb kwa- has a purely habitual meaning.
12.21 yi [taka-n kwa-k@-na]
ﬁre put-seq stay-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She will keep lighting a ﬁre’
The habitual marker can occur with the root kwa- ‘stay’ in one grammatical word,
e.g. walim@udi waku-n kwa-kwa-da s@k@r (rainbow go.out-seq stay-hab-3masc.sgsubj.vt+
3fem.sgbas.vt time) ‘the time when the rainbow usually stays having come out’. Without a
future marker, the verb kwa- in combination with a verb marked with a sequencing -n describes
a sequence of actions—see §18.2.
Etymologically, the habitual could well be related to the Wosera -kwa ‘vivid present’ (Wilson
1980: 68). No other Ndu language appears to use a habitual aspect marker of this shape.12.4 c o m p l e t e i n vo lv e m e n t o f s / o
The suﬃx -tu- ‘all’ indicates complete involvement of S or O. That an aﬃx referring to plurality
or complete coverage of participants operates on an absolutive basis is not uncommon crosslinguistically (Dixon 1994: 55). This suﬃx does not occur together with the habitual.","[284, 285, 286, 287]"

This grammar has been written as an integrated whole. To understand what follows one needs
to have digested what precedes. Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the main points of the
Manambu grammar. Later chapters deal with a particular grammatical topic each.
Chapter 3 discusses the ways in which grammatical relations are expressed. This chapter
is basic for understanding the rest of the grammar. Chapter 2 contains a detailed discussion
of phonology; it is not necessary to read to understand the rest of the grammar. Chapter 4
gives an overview of all the word classes, and Chapter 11 concentrates on the organization
of verbal morphology, giving a preview of Chapters 12–17. Chapters 18 and 19 deal with
complex clauses. Chapter 20 draws together the structure of clausal constituents, clauses, and
sentences, and discusses the principles and functions of constituent order and of order of
grammatical words within each constituent. Issues in semantics are addressed in Chapter 21.
Those interested in cultural background and historical and comparative problems are advised
to focus on Chapters 1 and 22.
Examples are numbered separately for each chapter. Examples from texts at the end of the
grammar are referred to with the letter T followed by the number of the text and the sentence
(that is, T2.40 refers to sentence 40 of Text 2).
All the examples and texts are supplied with an interlinear morpheme gloss, and then translated into English. Homophonous morphemes are diﬀerentiated by their glosses. The symbol
‘+’ is used to indicate fused morphemes, e.g. taba- is glossed as ‘hand+lk’, its underlying form
being ta:b ‘hand’ (with the long vowel shortened when the linker is added) and -a- ‘linker’.
Portmanteau morphemes are glossed with ‘:’, for instance, mæy ‘come:impv’. All grammatical
morphemes are glossed in small caps while lexical morphemes are in lower case. Pronominal
preﬁxes are shown as 1sg, 3pl, in lower case. For polysemous morphemes, diﬀerent translations
in glosses correspond to diﬀerent meanings.
Cross-references are of two kinds:
r Those preceded by § refer to chapter and section number: for instance, §11.1 refers to
section 1 of Chapter 11;
r Those beginning with a number refer to examples in the grammar: for instance, 11.1 refers
to example 1 in Chapter 11.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"13.2.3 Optative modality
The optative modality is used to express wishes, hoped for and often diﬃcult to accomplish.
Optative can be formed on ﬁrst and third person imperative with the marker -@u. This same
marker can occur on the irrealis forms discussed in §13.3 with a similar meaning (examples
13.29–40). Second person irrealis accompanied with the marker -@u is used to ﬁll in the gap in
the optative paradigm formed on the imperative. The marker -@u triggers the allomorph -l of
the third person feminine form (see §5.1.2). The ﬁrst person singular imperative marker -u is
realized as -@w before the optative -@u, as in 13.30.
The optative refers to actions in present and in future, but not in the past. On a particularly
hot and windless day Mali expressed a wish that:
13.29 ma:r vya-kwa-l-@u
wind hit-impv.3p-fem.sg-opt
‘I wish the wind could blow’28413 Mood and ModalityThe optative can be accompanied by an interjection: Žsa ‘attention getter; oh dear’ or Žsay ‘oh
dear’, as in 13.30–1.
13.30 Žsay pap@r vyakat-a ma:j wuk@w-@u
oh later good-lk story hear+1sgimpv-opt
‘I wish I could hear good news later’
In 13.31, Gemaj, fed up with waiting for a plane to come, exclaimed:
13.31 Žsa a
balus yabi:b da-kwa-l-@u
oh dem.dist.fem.sg plane quickly go.down-impv.3p-fem.sg-opt
‘Oh, I wish the plane could descend quickly!’
The optative can be used in maledictions, without implying an actual wish. A mother,
exasperated by annoying behaviour of a child, may exclaim 13.32, without actually wishing
the child dead. This is a more expressive version of 13.28.
kiya-kwa-l-@u
13.32 m@y-a-m@yab
real-lk-real+lk+term die-impv.3p-fem.sg-opt
‘May she well and truly die!’
Optative cannot be negated; a negative form of the irrealis (§13.3) is used instead. That is,
the subtle distinction between optative and irrealis is neutralized in negative constructions.
This agrees with the principle of dependencies between grammatical systems whereby fewer
categories may be distinguished in negative than in positive clauses (Aikhenvald and Dixon
1998).13.3 i r r e a l i s
In our discussion of the future in §12.2, we pointed out that, in non-negative main clauses, it
is homophonous with a form termed irrealis. As shown in 12.13–14, a verb form marked with
future -k@- can have a wide array of epistemic meanings, referring to something that is probably
happening, or might happen, or might have happened. Whether a form marked with -k@- has
an irrealis or a future meaning is often determined by the context (they are diﬀerentiated under
negation). In 13.33, a future meaning is highly unlikely: on hearing a cry, a woman suspects it
could be her baby daughter crying:
13.33 wun kwasa
ñan gra-k-na
I
small.fem.sg child cry-irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Perhaps my little daughter is crying’
The irrealis form is used in warnings, as in 13.34. I was told not to go and bathe in the ﬂooded
and muddy Sepik River, because:
karki
13.34 piñu-k-ñ@na
slip-irr-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt mud
‘You might slip in the mud’
The irrealis form is often used in juxtaposed clauses with counterfactual meanings (see §19.1,
and further examples there). An example of a counterfactual use of irrealis in an independent
clause is at 13.35 (continuation of 10.124). Kukelyabau is talking about a ﬁre during the Second
World War when a plane (the ﬁrst one she’d ever seen) crashed into the village: as soon as the13.3 Irrealis285plane went down, the villagers left their houses; had they not done so, they would have perished
in the ﬁre:

we would have ﬁnished, we would have died, we would never have been here’
In positive clauses, the future and the irrealis meanings are distinguished solely by context.
Under negation, however, the future and the epistemic meanings are distinguished formally:
future negation involves the negator ma: postposed to the uninﬂected root, while irrealis
negation involves ak@s with a fully inﬂected verb, as shown in the last two lines of 13.35 (see
further discussion in §§14.2–3). Another example is at 13.36, where irrealis forms appear in a
counterfactual conditional construction, both in the dependent clause and in the main clause:

Irrealis forms can be used as command strategies. Their illocutionary force is milder than
that of prohibitives—they sound more like a strong wish than a proper order, as in 13.37–8:
da-k-na-ñ@n
13.37 kap ak@s

‘May you not go down alone (to the toilet at night)’
ak@s
ja-k-na
13.38 wa:l s@r
rain tomorrow neg.irr fall-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘May it not rain tomorrow!’
To express a desire for something hardly attainable, the optative marker -@u is attached to the
irrealis form. Such forms only occur in main clauses. Third person feminine marker preceding
-@u is -l, just like with the optative discussed in §13.2.3. In 13.39, the speaker wished the frog
could frighten her naughty daughter and keep her quiet for a few minutes:
13.39 kra kra kra wa-k-na-l-@u
kra kra kra say-fut-act.foc-3fem.sgbas.vt-opt
‘(I wish) (the frog) could say kra kra kra’28613 Mood and ModalityOptative irrealis forms are negated with ak@s, just like the irrealis forms in 13.35–6. In 13.40,
Mali wished that it should not rain on us when we go to Swakap, notwithstanding black clouds
gathering on the horizon:
ja-k-na-l-@u
13.40 wa:l ak@s
rain neg.irr fall-fut-act.foc-3fem.sgbas.vt-opt
‘I wish it did not rain!’
The diﬀerence in meaning between 13.38 and 13.40 is subtle: the desire in 13.40 is likely to be
less attainable than that in 13.38. This agrees with general overtones of the optative marker in
Manambu.13.4 p ur p o s i v e
The purposive modality is used in main and in dependent clauses to express intention and
purpose. It distinguishes same-subject (§13.4.1) and diﬀerent-subject forms (§13.4.1). Samesubject forms are uninﬂected verbs, and diﬀerent-subject forms are partially inﬂected. This
accords with the general principle operating throughout the language: that same-subject verbs
are not marked for subject, and diﬀerent-subject verbs are (see Table 11.1, and Chapter 18). In
§13.4.3, we compare the ‘same-subject’ and ‘diﬀerent-subject’ purposive in terms of how they
are used.","[310, 311, 312, 313]"

Typologically speaking, focus constructions are often expressed via cleft clauses which, in
their turn, involve marking part of a clause as dependent. That a dependent clause negator is
used in focused clauses conﬁrms that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent.
However, there are no other overt indicators that the clause is desubordinated.
Desubordinated clauses containing fully inﬂected verbs are also negated with the dependent
clause negator -ma:r-. In 14.136, the elliptical answer to the question contains a desubordinated
relative clause:

‘When (lit. what time) did the earthquake strike? (Time when) you had not come’
In 14.137, what could have been phrased as a causal clause, just like 14.116 and the ﬁrst
clause of 14.55, was phrased as an independent clause negated with -ma:r- followed by the
conjunction al@k ‘this is why’ as an afterthought. This was Gemaj’s answer to an unstated
question why my sandals were getting loose.

We will see, in §19.9, that same-subject completive forms of the verb t@- ‘be, have’ are
developing into conjunctions which introduce what are treated as dependent clauses containing
fully inﬂected verbs. That this is really the case is corroborated by the fact that such newly
developed dependent clauses are negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown in
14.138. This is a comment on why a neighbouring group does not have any traditional masks
left:

Independent clauses can be negated with -ma:r- if they express wishes and regrets. Dameliway and myself developed a mutual liking for each other from the very ﬁrst meeting, at the end
of which she exclaimed:
14.139 oh, walba:b kwa-ma:r-na-dian

‘Oh (it is a pity that) we do not live close!’33214 NegationSimilarly, an exclamation at 14.140 expresses a wish that:
14.140 wan@b yi-ma:r-na

‘May she not make noise! (meaning I wish she did not make noise)’
Along similar lines, 14.141 expresses a regret concerning the ﬁshing grounds spoilt forever.

An independent clause negated with -ma:r- may also have an irrealis meaning if it occurs
with future marking; this is always mixed with a wish for the thing not to happen:

‘Having drowned (lit. eaten water), I will die, oh dear I might not see my only son’
If such a negated form follows a command, it may have an apprehensive meaning ‘or else’:

‘Wash these plates, or else you may not get the food’
The ways in which independent negative clauses marked with -ma:r- are used to express
meanings covering wishes, regrets, negative irrealis, and undesirable consequences can be
ultimately traced back to the negative focused clauses (as illustrated in 14.134–5): all of these
involve focusing on the non-activity.
The marker -ma:r- appears to be cognate to the negative imperative -mar-ék in Wosera
(Wilson 1980: 164–5). The use of the morpheme -ma:r- to express wishes is a link between
otherwise hardly comparable meanings of Manambu -ma:r- and Wosera -marék.14.6 i n h e r e n t ly ne gat i v e l e x e m e s a n d n e gat i v e p ro-c laus e s
Manambu has a number of inherently negative forms. These cannot be negated, and occur in
a negative context only.
The adverb s@m@rab, s@ma:b, sama:b or s@ms@ma:b ‘never ever’ is typically used in negated
clauses as an emphatic negator. It occurs both in declarative clauses which already have the
negator ma: as in 14.144 and T3.43, or ak@s, as in 14.50, and in commands, as in 14.95 and
14.145. The four forms appear fully synonymous.","[357, 358, 359]"

as in 20.55 and 20.58 (which contains a relative clause).
20.58 [ [b@r n@b@ k@-k@-bra]
[k@k@pa:t] ]
you.du able eat-fut-2dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt food
‘(What about) food you two will be able to eat?’
These clauses would not make sense as declarative verbless clauses, since—as we saw in A
above—verbless declarative clauses contain at least two independent NPs.
Polar questions display the same patterns of constituent order as do declarative clauses: 13.56
is an example of an oblique, ‘with them’, placed after the verb (see §20.2). Content questions
also display the same patterns.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause. It tends to gravitate towards the
beginning of the clause or to appear immediately before the verb, as in 10.87–8, T1.5, T1.30,
and T3.8. The only exceptions are verbless clauses involving the question word ata ata ‘how
how’ as in 10.100–2, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ (10.98): here the constituent order is
ﬁxed.
The pronoun s@ ‘who?’ is unlike other interrogative words in that it takes the linker -k@- in
order to combine with case markers. It is obligatorily marked for highlighting focus if in the
subject position. And if it is used as predicate head, as in 10.82, or is marked for focus, as in
10.83, and 20.59, its form is reminiscent of a headless associative NP (as illustrated in 8.14):
it takes gender-number markers -l- ‘feminine’, -d- ‘masculine’, -bra- ‘dual’, and -di- ‘plural’,
followed by a nominal predicate cross-referencing enclitic.

Examples like 20.59–60 can be interpreted as instances of obligatory grammaticalized focus,
not infrequent in content interrogatives worldwide. We will see, at §20.3 below, that a focused
constituent can only rarely be in the A function.
The interrogative ‘who’ can be marked for double focus; then the nominal cross-referencing
is repeated. The meaning is highly contrastive: ‘who is it really?’ (see §20.3). In 20.60, the
speaker is wondering whether the mysterious person who had entered his house is a man or a
woman.

A clause may consist just of a question word, as in the last clause of T1.23. And any verbal
form, including the permissive (13.10), can occur in a question.
When negated, both content and polar questions take the negative dependent clause marker
-ma:r- if they contain a verb—see 14.127–30. However, as we saw in §14.5.2, this is not the only
option. Many speakers (and especially young and innovative ones) use negative declarative
forms in negative questions, as in 14.131 and 14.151. If a negative question contains a nonverbal or a verbless clause, it has the same structure as its positive counterpart:20.1 Major constituents53120.61 k@

Negation
Manambu has a highly complicated system of negation. The choice of a negative form correlates with the tense, aspect, mood, and modality value of the clause, and with clause type.
We saw above that negation is often the only means of distinguishing otherwise homophonous
verb forms, and clause types.14.1 ne gat i o n o f d e c la rat i v e n o n- h a b i t ua l c laus e s
All declarative non-habitual clauses are negated with the negator ma:. Just as in positive
clauses, verbal predicates diﬀer from non-verbal predicates in what tense distinctions are
expressed under negation (see §12.1). Negation of verbal predicates (including copulas) is
discussed in §14.1.1. In §14.1.2 we look at how non-verbal predicates are negated.
The verbal negator ma: (variants: ma:n, ma""an, ma""a) has clausal scope, and is also used as
a pro-clause meaning ‘no’. The forms ma: and ma""a are in free variation; and so are ma:n and
ma""an (see §2.1.2). The variants ma: and ma:n are in free distribution in most instances, with
the variant ma:n found only with traditional and older speakers. The only noted diﬀerence
between the two is discussed under §14.1.2 (example 14.15). Additional uses of the negator ma:
are discussed in §14.6. See the discussion in §14.1.3.","[324, 325]"

Negated nominalizations can be used in lieu of negative commands, and as a means of
berating someone who has done something they should not have done, as in 9.20 and 14.75:
14.75 atawa kur-kur ma:
thus do-red neg
‘You shouldn’t have acted like this’ (lit. there is no doing that way)
A negated nominalization may also be used to straightforwardly negate an action no matter
whether good or bad. This is shown in 14.76, a description of what happened to a Gala man
who had survived the attack of the Avatip people, and hid in a hollow of a sago tree (the
continuation of this is 14.22). He was so weak that:

‘By and by (his) eye (became) bad, (with) his body (lit. legs and hands), he already could
not walk on his own’ (lit. there was no walking on his own)
A similar example is the ﬁrst clause of 14.73—the speaker was complaining that there is no
sleeping while children are making noise, not that one should not sleep when there is noise.
The meaning of a nominalization under negation is determined entirely by the context. The
meaning of ‘negative obligation’ is the most frequent one. And this is the reason why the
negation of nominalizations is considered within this section. However, this reading makes
little sense in a context like that in 14.76—then the meaning is ‘lack of action’.
And, as we saw in §9.1.1 (at VI), an additional problem may arise. The negative form of
the reduplicated intensive aspect of a verb may coincide with the reduplicated verb stem,
that is, a nominalization. In negative future, the negator is postposed to the negative form
of an inﬂected verb, making constructions like 9.20 and T1.15 inherently ambiguous between
(a) negated nominalization as a means of negative obligation; and (b) negative future of the
intensive aspect. Just as in 9.20, both readings make sense in the given context of a comic story
about a newly wed young man who had no idea that women menstruate, literally, ‘see moon’,
once a month. He decides to stop the moon from seeing his wife by going and ﬁghting her (cf.
3.15 and 7.76). T1.15 is what his relatives tell him: it is your own moon, and there is no point
in ﬁghting her.
However, such negative constructions are only ambiguous if the subject is second person
(the addressee), or a generic ‘one’, or a third person. Example 14.77 is not ambiguous—this
can only refer to the future. As shown in §12.2, future often has the meaning of ‘being able to’.
In this example, the man is not refusing to pay the bride price, he has no means of paying it.
The story from which 14.77 comes was told by a traditional speaker, and this explains the use
of negator ma:n; the form ma: would have been equally acceptable:
14.77 wun-a-d@ka [yapi-yapi ma:n]
I-lk-only buy-red neg
‘I by myself won’t pay the bride price’ (lit. ‘buy (wife)’)
A potential ambiguity in the context of non-ﬁrst person may be resolved by context: in the
ﬁrst clause of 14.73 the negated reduplicated verb cannot have a future intensive meaning,
because there is no future reference: the speaker was complaining about what was happening
in the house in general and the night before in particular.","[341, 342]"
"19
Other Dependent Clauses and Further
Features of Clause Linking
We will now discuss clause-linking devices other than clause chaining via medial dependent
clauses (see Aikhenvald forthcoming g, on their semantics). These include: juxtaposition of a
dependent clause and a main clause (§19.1); relative clauses (§19.2); clause linking via a case
marker ‘instead’ and a suﬃx ‘like’ (§19.3); purposive and desiderative clauses (§19.4); speech
reports (§19.5); clause linking involving connectives (§19.6); and juxtaposition of main clauses
(§19.7).
Manambu does not have complement clauses as a type on their own. Some types of medial
dependent clauses, juxtaposed clauses, purposives, desideratives, speech reports, and nominalizations can be used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Dependent clauses can be used
as main clauses. This phenomenon, known as desubordination, is addressed in §19.9, together
with grammaticalization and reinterpretation of ‘medial’ verbal forms.
Table 19.1 features a comparison of dependent medial clauses, juxtaposed dependent clauses,
relative clauses, and main clauses in terms of their constituent order, predicate head possibilities, and tense, aspect, and moods expressed. Relative clauses are more similar to juxtaposed
clauses than to clauses of the other two types.
A constituent in a medial completive clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is
a special property of these clauses which sets them apart from all other dependent clause types,
especially relative and conditional clauses (see §10.4).19.1 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f a de p e n d e n t c laus e a n d a m a i n c laus e
Juxtaposed clauses are a type of dependent clause with no segmental marking. Juxtaposed
clauses are preposed to a main clause. They mark absolute tense (unlike medial dependent
clauses whose tense is relative to that of the main clause). All aspect and tense distinctions
of main clauses can be expressed. Similarly to dependent clauses in general, and unlike main
clauses, juxtaposed clauses are negated with the subordinate negator -ma:r-. Uninﬂected aspectual and modal forms require a support verb to be able to be used in juxtaposed clauses.
A striking feature of juxtaposed clauses is their rising intonation contour with the pitch
going up on the last syllable of the predicate. This intonation contour may be the only
feature that distinguishes positive juxtaposed dependent clauses from juxtaposed main clauses
discussed at §19.7. Juxtaposed clauses are strictly verb ﬁnal.
Juxtaposed clauses often express condition. Examples with a positive clause expressing
counterfactual condition via irrealis marking are at 13.35–6 and 14.55–7 (also see §13.3 and
§14.3.1 on irrealis in positive and in negative clauses). Examples expressing real condition are
14.58, 14.123–4, and 18.12. As shown in 14.56, whether the condition is counterfactual or not
may depend on the context, given the inherent ambiguity between irrealis and future. Example
19.1 may have either of three meanings: ‘if I had gone, I would have told you (the secret)’,Table 19.1 Main clauses versus dependent clauses: some distinguishing features

context, the second reading was the most appropriate: the speaker had not yet gone, was not
sure if she was going, and telling the secret depended on her going to another village and
learning the details:

‘If I go, I will tell you (the secret)’
That is, a real-condition reading is appropriate in 19.1. This is in contrast to -ga:y ‘unlikely
condition’ (§18.8) which always has a conditional reading. Similar examples are at T3.23 and
T3.25.
Alternatively, a juxtaposed clause may have a purely temporal meaning. An example is at
19.2: we know that it is not conditional because of the context of the story: the man is bound
to hit the road to go back home. This example shows that a juxtaposed clause can be postposed
to the main clause, just like most other dependent clauses.

A similar example is in the ﬁrst clause of T3.43. Here, the juxtaposed clause cannot possibly
have a conditional reading.
A juxtaposed clause does not have to be contiguous with the main clause: in 19.3 a cotemporaneous clause intervenes between a juxtaposed clause and a main clause. This same example
shows that a juxtaposed dependent clause can itself contain a medial clause. The ‘relative tense’
of the medial clause is determined by the absolute tense of the juxtaposed clause.

Juxtaposed clauses are similar to main clauses in most ways, except negation. No such
clauses have been documented in related languages. This clause type may constitute a recent
innovation.19.2 r e lat i v e c lau s e s

d@y, dayNo cross-referencing is found in negative declarative non-habitual clauses, in positive completive and customary aspects and in a variety of non-declarative forms including prohibitive,
desiderative, and frustrative, and all same-subject medial clauses. These forms are uninﬂected.
See a summary in Table 11.1.
The number of cross-referencing positions on the verb only marginally relates to mood,
modality, polarity, and aspect. Most of the verbal forms which accept one cross-referencing
position or take no cross-referencing are non-declarative. Most negative forms take no crossreferencing at all.
The number of cross-referencing positions is independent of the verb’s transitivity. It
depends on the pragmatic properties of the non-subject constituent, and not so much the
lexical properties of the verb itself. This is partly reminiscent of Ugric and Samoyedic
languages.
There, a special verbal conjugation (called ‘objective’) is used for transitive verbs if the
object is deﬁnite or topical. A transitive verb with an indeﬁnite object appears in the ‘subjective’ conjugation (see, for instance, Moravcsik 1983 on Hungarian and Nikolaeva 1999 on
Northern Khanty). Diﬀerent sets of cross-referencing suﬃxes in Menya, an Angan language
from Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea (Whitehead 1991), mark more topical, and less
topical, subjects. However, in neither case is there a complete analogy with the Manambu
system.
The marking of A/S as the only cross-referenced constituent (‘basic’ marking set) is the same
as the marking of the second argument if it is more topical than the subject. This may seem
reminiscent of split ergativity whereby, under certain conditions, the S constituent (the only

a transitive verb). 1 However, the Manambu pattern is only superﬁcially similar to this, since:
(a) the basic cross-referencing set marks A/S and also O, a locative, a manner, or a time
constituent, that is, it is hardly comparable with a ‘real’ ergative/absolutive system, with
an opposition between S/O and A; and
(b) the occurrence of the marking is conditioned by the topicality of the participant and
only partly by its grammatical function (we can recall that some relations, such as copula
complement, or comitative, are never cross-referenced).
The closest analogy to the Manambu system comes from Alamblak (Sepik Hill: Bruce 1984:
184–8, 216–30). Here, an argument additional to the subject can be cross-referenced on the
verb ‘if it can be thought of as a crucial participant in the situation’ (219). Just as in Manambu,
the second argument marker follows the marker of the subject. However, unlike Manambu,
the same set of markers cross-references both arguments, and there are no special sets for nonverbal predicates. It is not clear whether there are any types of arguments which can never be
cross-referenced. Sare (or Kapriman), also from the Sepik Hill family, does not have this feature
(Sumbuk 1999). Is this similarity between Manambu and Alamblak a simple coincidence? Or,
given that some Manambu subclans claim their origins to be in the area of Chambri lake—
to the south of which Alamblak is spoken (see §1.5.3)—could this be an areal feature? The
question remains open. Also see §§22.2–3, where we return to the issue of areal diﬀusion.
We conclude that, though marking the pragmatic status of constituents through variation in
cross-referencing patterns on the verb is not unprecedented, no other system we know of is
fully comparable with the way Manambu verbs mark their participants.3.2 gramm atical relat ions marked on noun phrases
Cases in Manambu mark grammatical relations on a basic nominative-accusative principle.
Only deﬁnite and completely aﬀected objects are marked with the -Vm case ‘accusative/
locative’ (see §7.3 for a hypothesis concerning the motivation for this case syncretism). Table
3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate with
the marking on verbs as heads of predicates.
Table 3.5 shows that grammatical functions covered by the second-position cross-referencing
suﬃxes only somewhat overlap with the ones covered by cases. The case syncretism does not
fully coincide with the syncretism of meanings available for the basic cross-referencing set
when it refers to a non-subject constituent. We can recall that this may refer to location (for
which three cases are available: a location can be unmarked, marked with a locative case or
the terminative case); to an object (one case available), or to an instrument or manner (one
case available). This illustrates one-to-many correspondences in the relationship between crossreferencing on the verb and case marking on nouns. Case meanings below the thick line in
Table 3.5 do not have a cross-referencing correlate: these constituents are not cross-referenced.
An object marked with the accusative/locative case is likely to be a topic, and is crossreferenced more often than an unmarked O, in terms of textual frequency. However, this is not a
1 Instances whereby a language has an ergative pattern of marking grammatical relations depending on the topical
continuity of S/O include Asheninca Campa (an Arawak language from Peru: Payne and Payne (2005) showed how
a split intransitive pattern marks the main story line, or foregrounded actions). In Yagua (Peba-Yagua) and Pajonal
Campa (Arawak), S is marked like O to highlight some new information (but not a new participant) (Dixon 1994:
211).","[91, 92, 93, 94]"
"50619 Other Dependent ClausesThis form is indeed in the process of grammaticalization as part of a complex connective:
al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so,
as a result’ (§19.6 and 19.78). Fixed combinations [ak@m t@-ku] (where+loc stay-compl.ss)
or [ak@b t@-ku] (where+term stay-compl.ss) meaning ‘where from?’ (as in 7.29 and 7.55) are
frequently used as an interrogative on their own: we can recall, from §10.4, that Manambu does
not have a dedicated interrogative form meaning ‘where from’ (there is one meaning ‘where to’,
and another one meaning ‘where (location)’). A desubordinated verb is again used to ﬁll a gap:
ak@m t@-ku can be considered a new interrogative form. Desubordinated sequencing forms
containing -n are on the way towards being reinterpreted as adverbs; see 18.7–8 in §18.2 (also
see §4.4). Unlike corresponding verbal forms, they cannot be negated separately.
We can recall, from 18.8, that s@b@n@-n (return-seq) can be used as a verbal modiﬁer meaning
‘back’, and can also be used as a medial verb ‘returning’. The two usages can be distinguished:
the verb in a dependent clause can have its own arguments and obliques and can be negated,
and the verbal modiﬁer cannot.
The dependent clause verb s@b@n-@n in its negative and positive form is illustrated in 19.115.
The relevant forms are underlined.

The same form s@b@n@n reanalysed as a verbal modiﬁer in 18.8 cannot be negated, since
negation is a clausal category in Manambu, and a verbal modiﬁer cannot be negated.
A cotemporaneous form of wa- ‘say’ in the form ata-wa-ta:y (then-say-cotemp) has developed into a connective ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’—see §19.6 (especially example
19.80). And the verb yi- with a sequencing medial clause marker -n is often employed as a
marker of continuing action, as in 18.9 and 19.116.

In summary: desubordination of dependent clauses and subsequent grammaticalization of
the most frequently used desubordinated forms is an ongoing process in Manambu.","[532, 533]"

III. Reason, cause, and purpose are expressed as direct speech reports. Example 19.71 did not
involve any speech acts. This was an answer to a child’s question about why her mother had
gone out:

‘She has gone out because of (desire to) pee’ (lit. ‘saying “because of pee” she went out’)
And 16.81 explains the intentions of 9-month-old baby who could not yet talk.
We saw, at §16.2.2, that speech reports are one of the biclausal causative strategies; examples
are at 16.84, 13.24–5, and T2.34.
IV. Apprehensives can be expressed as direct speech reports. In 19.72 a speech report with an
apprehensive meaning contains an irrealis form meaning ‘might’ (see §13.3):

‘So they were afraid, men too, lest the dogs might hit them (lit. having said “Those dogs
might hit us” )’
V. The end result of counting is usually expressed as direct speech report, as in 19.73 and
T2.21. Neither of these contains an actual speech report: the child we were talking about in
19.73 did not speak Manambu and was too shy to speak in the presence of a white woman
anyway.
19.73 nabi a:li wa:d
year four say+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
‘He is 4’ (lit. ‘he says four’)
We have seen that speech reports do not have to imply a speech act. However, there are two
major diﬀerences between speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act and those
reports that do.
First, a direct speech report can precede or follow the reporting verb (as we saw in §19.5.1
above) only if the actual speaking took place. If a speech report is used to express any of
the meanings detailed in I–V in this section, it always has to precede the verb ‘say’. Reported
commands as indirect speech reports also have to precede the verb of speech.
Secondly, speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act tend not to be introduced
by a speech introducer ata ‘then’ (see Aikhenvald 2008).
An additional way of making clear that a speech act has actually taken place is by using a
‘framing’ construction illustrated in 19.51. Then, if a speech report follows the framing clause,
another framing clause is often added at the end of the speech report of the kind ‘they said
[Speech Report] having said’. A typical example is at 19.74:19.6 Clause linking involving connectives49319.74 [wa:l ja-k-na-d]

then say+3masc.sgbas.p no
rain neg say-compl:ss
‘ “It will rain”, I said saying, then he said, “No, it won’t rain”, having said’
A speech report which does not imply a speech act cannot be used in such a ‘framing’
construction. Neither can the verb wa- in any of its ditransitive or transitive usages without
a direct speech report; nor if it is used in one of the lexicalized collocations, such as ma: wa‘refuse, reject’ or ya:kya wa- ‘agree’.
Framing constructions are very frequent. They also appear in speech reports in the local
Tok Pisin: one frequently hears a dialogue being reported using a quote frame na em i tok
olsem na em i tok (and he said thus and he said). This apparent redundancy serves a purpose:
it distinguishes speech acts as speech acts from their metaphorical extensions.19.6 c lause linking involving connectives
Connectives involved in linking clauses occupy clause-initial position. Connectives do not
occur in any of the medial clauses discussed in Chapter 18, or dependent clauses in this chapter.
The connective a-l@-k ‘because; this is why’ is an exception: it can occur in a causal clause (as in
19.75). This connective derives from that-fem.sg-DAT ‘for that’ and is employed only if explicit
statement of reason is appropriate:
19.75 [l@ wuk@mar-la]
[al@k
ma:
she forget-3fem.sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p this.is.why again
wa-tua,
a
ma:j]
say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg story
‘She forgot (it), this is why I am telling it again, the story’
A similar example is at 4.16. Alternatively, the connective al@k can be used within a causal
clause, as in 19.76. This is an explanation as to why there is no men’s road and women’s road
in Malu village.

road is small, it is diﬃcult (to have them)’
In T1.16 al@k occurs after the subject wun ‘I’, since the subject is fronted as part of a topicalization strategy (see §20.2). This connective can link sentences as well as clauses as in 18.25,
and T1.22. It often occurs in a main clause preceded by a medial causal clause, as in 18.49 and
19.77, or by another medial clause, as in 18.52.

their etymology: both come from a dative-marked feminine form of the functionally unmarked
distal demonstrative a-.
We saw in §18.3 that the medial clause form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a
conjunction ‘thus, and so’ when it follows another medial clause (see 18.28). This form is indeed
in the process of grammaticalization as part of a conjunction: al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat
stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’. It is pronounced as one
phonological word. This connective does not occur with causal clauses. An example is in 19.78:
19.78 [sana:k

[al@k
this.is.why be-compl.ss neg have.neg
‘They (the neighbouring group) gave away the things from men’s house for money, this
is why they do not have (them anymore)’
The connective aw ‘and then; so; but’ links clauses and sentences. Its meaning may involve
contrast, as in 19.79:
wun ñan ma: t@],
[a-d@-r@b
19.79 [vyak@ta-d],

lukauti-t@k]
look.after-1duimpv
‘He (the foundling) is nice, and (surprise, surprise: unlike any normal woman) I don’t
have a child, (so) let’s look right after this one’
It occurs as a sentence linker in T2.5–6, and T2.8–9. Also see 19.72 for its sequential
meaning. When repeated, it refers to alternating actions, as in aw yi-n aw ya-n (and.then
go-seq and.then come-seq) ‘on the one hand coming, on the other hand going’ (T3.18). A
similar example, aw war-@n aw da-n (then go.up-seq then go.down-seq) ‘alternately going up
and coming down’ is in T2.8. This same form can link noun phrases, e.g. aw kami: aw lau-lap
(then ﬁsh then ripe-banana) ‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana’ (or both).
The connective a ‘then, as a result’ has a sequential meaning, as in T2.3 and 19.4. It can link
dependent clauses, as in T3.18 where it is similar to aw. It may have an adversative meaning,
roughly translatable as ‘but’, as in 10.22b. The form a probably comes from the feminine distal
demonstrative ‘that’.
Connectives which link sentences within a paragraph are ata ‘then’, and atawata:y (from ata
wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’. The latter is a result of a
recent grammaticalization of ata and a medial clause form of ‘say’. The semantic development
is congruent with the use of wa- ‘say’ to express reason (see §19.5.6). The connective atawata:y is
often used without reference to an actual speech act, as in 18.33 where the speaker talks about
how the Avatip people lived during the Second World War when they had to hide from the
Japanese invaders. Or it may refer cataphorically or anaphorically to an actual speech report,
as in 19.80:

‘Thus/this way they lied to him about women (lit. put woman-lie to him), “You will
marry a woman, we will give you a young woman”, thus they said to him’
The connective ata often introduces speech reports which imply actual speech, as can be
seen throughout the texts at the end of this grammar. It typically precedes the verb and never
occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see examples 4.12 and T1.1, T1.8, T1.10, and T1.12). In
the third clause of T1.12 the connective ata is placed after the imperative verb ‘go’; this adds
to the urgency of the command.
Ata can intervene between parts of numerous multiword constituents involving verbs (for
instance, complex predicates: see §17.1–5, and negative constructions: see Chapter 14).
The question of whether the form ata meaning ‘how; thus’ and ata as a negator of desiderative and same-subject purposive (see §14.3.2) are related to each other and to the connective
ata remains open. Several instances of ata in its diﬀerent meanings do not occur; we can recall,
from §10.4, that a repeated form ata ata has just the interrogative meaning ‘how?’
When used in the predicate slot or as part of predicate focus, ata ‘connective’ and ata ‘thus,
how’ take the predicate marker -n (see §10.2.3 on its occurrence with reactivated topic-marking
demonstratives), as in 4.79 and 10.103. No other connective can be focused or head a predicate.
The connective k@pa:b ‘in case’ introduces dependent conditional clauses discussed at §13.7
and §18.8 (examples 13.88, and 18.52). This connective is most probably a terminative case form
of k@ p ‘just’ (§21.2.2). Just like any other connective, k@pa:b occupies a clause-initial position.19.7 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f m a i n c laus e s
Several main clauses can be juxtaposed to one another. Such juxtaposed main clauses do
not have a special rising intonation contour characteristic of dependent juxtaposed clauses
discussed at §19.1. There is usually a short pause between the clauses. Juxtaposition of clauses
has the following semantic eﬀects.
I. A subsequent clause oﬀers a comment or a clariﬁcation to the preceding clause, elaborating
on it. Examples include 19.79, and also 19.9, 19.29, 14.11, 14.12, 14.53, 14.95, 14.97, 14.104, and
T1.9, T1.19–20, T1.22, and T1.28. A similar example is at 19.81: Kuk@lyabau was explaining
that she was a little girl when the Second World War broke out. The fourth clause provides
additional information to the third clause.

rhetorical device, to make sure the hearer understands the point made. Similar examples come
from beginnings and endings of stories—this can be seen in T1.35, T2.68, and T3.1.
II. A subsequent clause oﬀers an alternative, or a correction, to the preceding clause, as in
14.102 and 14.105. If the subsequent clause is cast in irrealis (see §13.3), it acquires an apprehensive meaning—that is, is understood as a warning against something negative. Examples
are at 13.43 and 19.82.

‘Turn that plate upside down, or else a ﬂy would sit (on it)’
A juxtaposed irrealis clause can be negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown
in 19.83 (the meaning is that of possible negative consequence). This is unlike irrealis in main
clauses which is negated with the particle ak@s (see §14.3.1); also see 13.35. This suggests that
juxtaposed irrealis clauses could well be treated as a subtype of dependent clauses.

III. If one of the clauses is negated, the relationship between juxtaposed clauses is that of
contrast, as in 14.41, 14.135, and 14.156. Juxtaposition of a positive and a negative clause can
be used as a means of clausal disjunction, as in 7.23.
IV. The subsequent clause marks consequence or reason if it contains an imperative or a
desiderative, as in 13.12, 13.20, 13.23–4, 13.58, 14.31, 14.90, 14.108, and 19.48. Both clauses
can contain either an imperative or a desiderative, as in 19.84.
19.84 [væk akrawul]
[s@kul@k yi-k@r]
pot impv+bring+inside cooking do-des
‘Bring the pot inside (the house), (because) I want to cook’
V. A clause juxtaposed to another clause has a simultaneous temporal meaning if the verb
cross-references time in the second position. This is the case in 19.81 (second clause: ‘(time
when) the war came’) and 9.33. This illustrates the anaphoric or cataphoric function of crossreferencing time in the second position on the verb, which acts as an additional clause-linking
device.
VI. Juxtaposition of clauses may also reﬂect a sequence of actions, as in T1.27. Juxtaposition
of two clauses with positional verbs has a similar eﬀect, e.g. 19.85:
19.85 [wun-a-d@

in clause juxtaposition, with just one exception: if juxtaposition of clauses reﬂects a sequence
of actions the subjects are always shared.19.8 c o m p l e m e n tat i o n s t rat e g i e s
Manambu has no complement clauses as a separate clause type. Existing clause types are
used in lieu of complement clauses depending on verb type, the semantics of complement
clause (whether fact or activity, or potential), and the relative tense of the complement clause
(see Dixon 2006, for the basic principles for a typological approach to complementation). A
clausal complement can be in S or O function (but never in A function). These correlations are
summarized in Table 19.4.
We discuss the existing complementation strategies one by one.
I. Completive medial clauses (discussed at §18.3) are used as clausal complements exclusively
in O function, with the verbs of perception such as ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen/obey’ (and
compounds and directional forms involving these: see Chapters 15 and 16). They indicate that
the action of the clausal complement precedes that of the main clause. The semantics of clausal
complement is activity or fact. If the subject of the main clause and of the clausal complement
are diﬀerent, diﬀerent subject forms are employed. Examples are at 19.86–7; also see T2.4,
T3.20, and T3.48.

II. Juxtaposition of main clauses (also see §19.7) is used for a clausal complement in O function with the same verbs of perception. Juxtaposition is used if the action of the complement
is either simultaneous or subsequent to the main clause—in contrast to the completive medial
clauses in I above. Examples of simultaneous action are at 19.48, 19.88–9, 19.93a–b, 19.94, and
also T1.11 and T3.16.

If the action of the clausal complement is subsequent to that of the main clause, it can be
cast in future tense, as in 19.90. Such constructions are polysemous, in that they can denoteTable 19.4 Complementation strategies in Manambu

with irrealis.

(a) ‘I will see her appear’ (lit, she will appear I will see)
(b) ‘I will see if she appears’
The sentence in 19.90 could also be understood as consisting of a juxtaposed dependent
clause and a main clause (see §19.1), if it had a characteristic intonation contour with sharp
rise on the last word of the juxtaposed clause. Then the reading would have been ‘If she had
appeared I would have seen her/it’. This highlights the importance of intonation.
A juxtaposed main clause can be used in lieu of a clausal complement of verbs ma: wa(no say) ‘refuse’ and ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree’, when they refer to a fact or activity and
involve diﬀerent subjects. We will see, at IV below, that if their subjects are the same, the
same-subject purposive or dative-aversive-marked nominalization will be preferred. Potential meaning entails the use of either diﬀerent-subject purposive or a dative-aversive-marked
nominalization. In 19.91, a fact complement expressed with a juxtaposed clause (clause 1) is
contrasted to a potential complement expressed with a dative-aversive-marked nominalization.

Juxtaposition is also used if the clausal complement is in S function of the verb kus@- ‘ﬁnish’.
The clause which corresponds to the complement often cross-references time or manner in
second position. The main clause takes feminine singular cross-referencing as a default option
(see §5.2.3).

Juxtaposition of a main clause can also be used in lieu of a clausal argument in the O slot of
mental processes: knowing, as in 19.93a–b, and forgetting, as in 19.94. The juxtaposed clause
as a complementation strategy can be preposed or postposed to the clause containing the verb
of mental process:

‘Then I forgot that I put (the hair cream on top of the mosquito net)’ (lit. I forgot it-wasthe case that I put (it there) )
Finally, one main clause juxtaposed to another may be used in lieu of a clausal argument
marking an activity in the S function in a verbless clause, as in 19.95.
19.95 [vyak@t-a]
[væra-m@na]
good-3fem.sgnom come.toward-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It is good you came/are coming’ (lit. it is good—you came/are coming)
In each case, the clause boundary is signalled by an intonation break (less than a second
duration).
III. A relative clause with or without an overtly stated head noun can be used to express
clausal complement referring to a fact, as in 19.96a–b. The way of saying ‘tell me why you
came’ is ‘tell me the reason for which you came’.
19.96a [ya-m@na
maw]

[wa-m@na]
[wuk@u]
say-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt listen+1sgimpv
‘You tell why you came, so that I listen’
Another way of saying essentially the same thing is 19.96b. The diﬀerence is that in 19.96a
the speaker is requesting the full story concerning the reason of the other person’s coming,
while 19.96b presupposes a simpler statement—a ‘thing’ fought about:
19.96b [warya-bra
ja:p] [ma: la:kw]
ﬁght+come-3dusubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p thing neg know:neg
‘I do not know why (lit. thing) they fought about’
Headless relative clauses, like the one at 19.25 (and 19.23a), can also be interpreted as
complementation strategies. They can express fact or activity. The syntactic context in 19.25
makes it clear that we are dealing with a headless relative clause: the common argument has
been omitted, but the adjective referring to it remains in its position in the noun phrase.
However, we saw above that a headless relative clause can be almost indistinguishable from
a main clause (cf. 19.26). And clause juxtaposition as a complementation strategy may also
be homonymous with a headless relative clause. So, 19.97a is inherently ambiguous between
reading (a), with a juxtaposed clause as a complementation strategy, and reading (b) as a
headless relative clause.

dependent clause negator -ma:r-, and the juxtaposed clause would be negated like any main
clause (§14.5). The negated relative clause is at 19.97b, and a juxtaposed main clause at 19.97c:

A similar example, with a verb of knowledge and understanding, is at 19.98, an angry shout at
a naughty and disobedient child:
19.98 [laku-ñ@na]
[wa-tua]
know/understand-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-1fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
(a) ‘Did you understand that I was telling you (what to do)?’
(b) ‘Did you understand what I was telling you?’
IV. Same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if semantically appropriate, as shown in 7.76 and 19.43 (see §19.4.1). Same-subject purposive can also be used as a
complementation strategy with the verb ‘say’ if the subject of the verb expressing purpose or
intention is coreferential with the subject of ‘say’—see 13.45, 19.57 (§19.5.4), and 19.99:

wa-m@n@-l]
say-2masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘When I was a small girl you spoke of marrying me’
V. Different-subject purposive clauses can mark a purpose complement of any verb (see
§19.4.1 and §13.4.2, and 13.54–5). This is also used in indirect commands, as in 19.54 and
13.49. A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: 19.100 is ambiguous between
‘we told them to go to the house’ and ‘we wanted them to go to the house’. This ambiguity can
only be resolved by context.
19.100 [wiya:r

house+lk+all go-3du-purp.ds say-1plsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
(a) ‘We told them two to go to the house’
(b) ‘We wanted them two to go to the house’
In 13.51, only the ‘wanting’ reading is appropriate, since there was no speech act involved.
In diﬀerent subject ‘wanting’ constructions, the verb ‘say’ can be omitted, as in 19.101. Then,
there is no ambiguity between ‘telling someone to do something’ and ‘wanting someone to do
something’. Similar examples are at 13.55, and 14.70.

This use of the diﬀerentsubject purposive may be interpreted as an instance of desubordination—whereby the erstwhile
dependent clause becomes a main clause. Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are also used as
complementation strategies with verbs of asking, as in 13.52. An alternative is a direct speech
report, or a reported question, in VI below.
VI. Desiderative clause can mark a purposive complement of any verb—see §19.4.2 and §13.5
and 19.47. Desideratives in dependent clauses in O function can be used as complementation
strategies with potential meaning involving verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ in
19.102:
19.102 [wun tapwuk ba:d k@-k@r] [kwas@k yi-na-d@wun-@k]
I
chicken egg eat-des unwilling go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘I am unwilling to eat chicken egg’
A desiderative clause in the direct speech report slot of the verb wa- is the only way of
reporting non-ﬁrst person’s desire—see 19.58 and 13.57. A desiderative clause can be in the
S slot of a verbless clause—see 13.65.
VII. Direct speech reports framed by the verb wa- ‘say’ can be used as complementation
strategies. We saw in §19.5 above that a direct speech report is a special grammatical relation.
The meanings of direct speech reports range from fact/activity to potential, and can involve
statements, questions, and commands.
VIII. Reported questions can be used as complementation strategies in the O slot of the verb
of knowledge/understanding:
19.103 [wun-aba:b ma: la:kw]
[agwa-mi d@-k@-di t@k@-mi-a-di]

[kas
du-ta:kw
t@-na-di]
I
neg know:neg how.many man-woman be/have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘I do not know how many people they have (in Malu)’
In 19.104, the interrogative quantiﬁer kas is postposed to the noun ‘people’ which is its normal
position (see 10.109–10 in §10.4). Reported questions typically refer to fact or activity. They
are rather rare in discourse of any sort, and may have been calqued from Tok Pisin or even
English.
IX. Nominalizations are widely used as complementation strategies. We can recall, from
§9.1.1, that deverbal nominalizations with Ø-case marking in O function are employed as
complementation strategies, with the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8. A deverbal
nominalization in S function can also serve as a complementation strategy, as in 9.3. A
nominalization can be a complement of a verb ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 4.7, 9.9, 19.43, and T3.20,
T3.33, and T3.35. An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in T3.34 (where
it is negated). These nominalizations always refer to activity or fact.
Deverbal nominalizations marked with dative-aversive case -Vk are used in the O slot of
verbs to do with not wanting, refusing, forbidding, feeling shame, as in 9.5–6, 13.78, and 13.81,
waiting as in 9.4, forgetting as in 13.79, being afraid of doing something, as in 13.82, and in the
sense of ‘for fear of’, as in 9.7 and 13.83, or ordering not to do something, as in 15.111.","[518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529]"
"11.2 Non-verbal predicate heads249We will see in §14.5 and in Chapter 18 that relative clauses and juxtaposed sequencing clauses
can be distinguished from main clauses only by the ways in which they are negated. That
more formal distinctions in clause types are made in negative than in positive polarity appears
to contradict the general spirit of dependencies between grammatical systems. In addition,
Manambu has one imperative construction, and three ways of marking prohibitive. These
features are typologically unusual.11.2 t h e s t ru c t u r e o f no n-v e r ba l p r e d i c at e h e a d s
Non-verbal predicate heads are simpler in structure than verbs: they can only take nominal
cross-referencing enclitics (listed in Table 3.4), and the conﬁrmation marker. This is shown in
Scheme 11.4.
Non-verbal predicate heads include nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and members of most closed
classes. In addition, there are a few special cases.
First, reactivated topic demonstratives, and manner demonstratives and interrogatives
(§10.2.2, §10.2.3, and §10.4), take the predicative marker -n, and do not occur with any person
markers. Of these, only manner demonstratives can take the conﬁrmation marker, e.g. 11.6:
11.6 ak@tawa-n-@k
like.this-pred-conf
‘It is really like this (as far as the speaker is concerned)’
And secondly, we can recall, from §10.2.3, that reactivated topic demonstratives contain a
predicate marker -n- when focused or when used as predicate heads. Again, no person enclitics
can be used.
When an agreeing adjective (‘small’ or ‘big’—see §4.3.1) or any other agreeing modiﬁers
from closed classes occur in the predicate slot, they also take subject agreement marking. This
results in what can be seen as redundant double agreement in gender with the same constituent,
as shown in 11.7:
11.7 numa-d-ad@wun
big-masc.sg-1masc.sgnom
‘I (man) am big’
The agreeing adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ is not used as a predicate head. Further examples of nonverbal predicates are in 3.12–13; also see T3.8 (‘I am Oselo’).
Just like a fully inﬂected verb, a non-verbal predicate can be within the scope of highlighting
focus. Then, the non-verbal predicate head is marked—for the second time—with non-verbal
person markers. An example is under 11.8. Square brackets mark the boundaries of a clause
with a non-verbal predicate as its head, ‘it is a man’. Curly brackets indicate that the clause is
within the scope of highlighting focus—see §20.3.

2. Subject marked with the nominal cross-referencing enclitics

‘It is the case that it is a man’
Clauses with non-verbal predicates are negated diﬀerently from verbal clauses (see §14.1.2,
and §20.1.3). If a speaker wishes to express tense, aspect, mood, and modality distinctions in a
clause headed by a non-verbal predicate, or make it into a dependent clause, the only option is
for the non-verbal form to be used as the complement of the support verb t@-. The copula then
carries all the required speciﬁcations, as in 11.9 and 11.10.
11.9 wun [du t@-k@r]
I
man be-des
‘I want to be a man’
The copula complement and the copula verb carrying the desiderative inﬂection are in square
brackets in 11.9.

Non-verbal predicates share this property with uninﬂected verbs (see §4.2.2; and also §§12.6–7,
and §17.2).11.3 ro o t a lt e r nat i o n s i n v e r b s
About 50 per cent of verbs have one form in all the morphological contexts. The remainder
of verbs have a number of root alternations discussed here. These are independent of the
semantics of the verb or its transitivity. First, we outline a number of automatic alternations
characteristic of all verbs (§11.3.1), and then discuss types of verbs with speciﬁc root alternations (§11.3.2).","[275, 276, 277]"

expressing the idea of getting them to eat, or making them eat. The predicate of the last clause contains
an aspectual compound (§15.3.1) with durative meaning.

The copula t@- is also used in the meaning of ‘become’, as in 3.8–9 and 20.28–9. These examples show that the copula complement of ‘become’ can be a noun (as in 20.28 and T2.42), or
an adjective (as in 20.29). In T1.8, the copula complement is a deictic adverb, atawa ‘like that’.

It is also used in the meaning of ‘have’ with any kind of possessum, as in 4.18, 8.16, and
14.33. In T1.4 a clause with t@- can be interpreted either as existential (‘the sickness which
exists on/to us-our village women’) or as possessive (‘the sickness we-our village women have’).
The verb t@- is not used to express identity or equation; neither are the two other postural
verbs. The verb kwa- ‘stay’ can be used in the meaning of ‘become and remain’, as shown in
the last clause in 20.30:
[samasa:m

stay-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-because
‘There are also four chiefs (lit. chiefs who go out ﬁrst), because we remain numerous’
This is consistent with its lexical meaning of ‘staying’ and the way it is used in aspectual
complex predicates to express prolonged durative meaning.
Other polyfunctional verbs used as copulas express identity and attribution. Their choice
depends on the copula complement and in fact is only partly predictable.
As mentioned at B in §4.2.2, the copula verbs na- ‘be (of physical states; natural phenomena)’, tay -‘be (of climatic states)’, yasa-/yas@- ‘be (of physical states, e.g. hunger, thirst)’, and
say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame or pins and needles)’ allow an additional option. They
can take third person feminine cross-referencing, with the experiencer optionally added if
appropriate. Examples are at 20.31a–34a. Or the experiencer can be cross-referenced on the
copula verb. Examples are at 20.31b–34b. There are no restrictions on the person of the
experiencer.
Each of the examples at (a) in 20.31–2 allows for two interpretations, no matter whether the
overt experiencer is present or not (see §20.4.3 on ellipsis): they either refer to a general state
of aﬀairs, or to the feelings or state of an experiencer participant. Examples at (b) only refer
to the state of the experiencer. As always in Manambu, the overt NP can be omitted. The two
readings (i) and (ii) are equally frequent, and only context provides the clue. The person does
not have to be ‘I’—there are no restrictions on the person choice.

of a particular experiencer (not necessarily ﬁrst person).

And example 20.34a has only one reading—it can only refer to hunger (or other physical
feelings: see 4.26a–d):
20.34a (wun) ka:m yasa-na

‘I am hungry’
20.34b (wun) ka:m yasa-na-wun
I
hunger be:desire-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am hungry’
In contrast, the meaning of the (b) examples at 20.31–4 is pretty uniform: ﬁrst, they always
imply the presence of an experiencer—cross-referenced on the verb—and secondly, the speaker
is focusing on the state of the experiencer—who is also topical. This is why it is underlined in
the translations.
This is very similar to the alternations in cross-referencing we already saw in ‘body part
constructions’ many of which use the copula or polyfunctional verbs discussed here—see §17.4,
and especially examples 17.57–9. A similar example, with the word mawul ‘insides; feelings’,
appears in 14.87. Along similar lines, a normal way of saying ‘I am angry’ is 20.35a. This is
another example of a body part construction.
20.35a (wun) ya:l gra-na
(I)
belly cry-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am angry’
If I want to focus on my anger, to make sure people understand that I am well and truly
angry, I would say:
20.35b (wun) ya:l gra-na-wun
(I)
belly cry-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am angry’52220 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesIn each of these cases, the choice of a pattern—whether to cross-reference an experiencer or
not—has repercussions on the use of switch-reference in clause chaining. We recall, from §18.3,
that body part constructions and copula clauses with these four verbs usually trigger diﬀerent
subject medial markers even if the experiencer is the same as the subject of a subsequent clause,
as in 18.24 and 20.36a:
20.36a [wus yasa-l@-k]
[a-wa-j@wi]
urine be:desire-3fem.sg-compl.ds impv-say-be.awake
‘If you feel like peeing wake (me up)’
The independent clause alternative for the ﬁrst clause in 20.36a is 20.36b, where the experiencer is not cross-referenced on the copula verb.
20.36b (ñ@n)
wus yasa-na
you.fem urine be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘You feel like peeing’
This clause was used as a juxtaposed dependent clause in (i), a version of 20.36a:
20.36c [wus yasa-na]
[a-wa-j@wi]
urine be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt impv-say-be.awake
‘If you feel like peeing wake (me up)’
However, as we saw in §18.3 (18.25–6), if the subject is topical, it can be treated as ‘same’ with
respect to switch-reference even within a body part construction. Such examples also occur
with copula verb structures illustrated in 20.31–4 above, but they are less frequent. Another
example is in 20.37.
20.37 [abakapi ata ka:m yasa-d]
[ka:m yasa-ku,]
[ya:k]
hawk
then hunger be:desire-3masc.sgbas.p hunger be:desire-compl.ss OK
‘The hawk then felt hunger, after he felt hunger, it was OK’
As we saw in 17.60, even if the experiencer is cross-referenced on the polyfunctional copula verb
yas@-/yasa- ‘be (of desires)’ in a main clause, it may not be cross-referenced on an adjacent
dependent clause. Another rare example of the experiencer cross-referenced on copula verb
within a dependent clause is at 20.63. We return to this phenomenon—rather pervasive in
Papuan languages—in §20.1.4.
Unlike the four copula verbs discussed above, the verb yæy- ‘be: of smell’ does not refer to a
feeling by any particular experiencer; typical examples are at 4.28 and 20.38.
ya:m yæy-na
20.38 du-a-jig@r@pa
man-lk-bodysmell+lk smell be:smell-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘There is a smell of human body’
∗
‘I smell human body’, ∗ ‘I emit a smell’
We already mentioned in §4.5 that the copula subject behaves like any other subject. In
contrast, the copula complement of any copula verb is diﬀerent from any other type of
argument. It can never be cross-referenced on the copula verb. A copula complement cannot
be case marked, or independently focused in a highlighting focus construction (§20.3).
None of the copula clauses can form an imperative. The verbs t@-, r @-, and kwa- do form
imperatives when used in their positional senses (‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’ respectively). The
copula na- ‘be: of physical states, natural phenomena’ can occur in a command phrased as a20.1 Major constituents523sequencing clause chain only if used as a support verb (see §17.2.3 and example 17.36a). Other
than that, copula clauses have all the properties of verbal clauses.
We now turn to non-verbal clauses, that is, clauses which have a member of a word class
other than a verb in their predicate slot. We saw in §3.1 that non-verbs in the predicate slot
require nominal cross-referencing enclitics cross-referencing their subject (see Table 3.4). This
cross-referencing is not tense sensitive—that is, the tense distinctions expressed in verbs are not
marked for non-verbal predicates.
As mentioned in §12.1, to express tense, aspect, or any other further categories, non-verbs
have to be used as complements of a support verb (most frequently, t@- ‘be, have, stand’). Also,
if a non-verbal clause is to be used in a depedent clause, the non-verbal predicate has to occur
with the support verb—see further discussion in §17.2.3.
Non-verbal predicates are negated diﬀerently from verbs—see §14.1.2, and especially
Scheme 14.2. The negator ma: is postposed to the non-verb, and the person, number, and
gender cross-referencing enclitics are suppressed. We can recall that, to negate a non-future
declarative non-habitual verb, the same negator is preposed to a special negative verb form
stripped of any cross-referencing. And to negate a future declarative non-habitual verb, the
negator is postposed to the verb root (which is often diﬀerent from the negative non-future
form: see §14.1.1). These tense distinctions in negative declarative verbs are irrelevant for
negative non-verbs. Example 20.39 recapitulates these correlations: 20.39a is an example of
a non-future declarative negative verbal clause; 20.39b is the same example cast in the future;
and 20.39c is a non-verbal negative clause. The only feature declarative negative verbal and
non-verbal clauses share is the lack of personal cross-referencing.
20.39a ñan ma: t@
child neg have+neg
‘(I/you/we/they etc.) do not/did not have a child’
20.39b ñan t@

‘(I/you/we/they etc.) will not have a child’
20.39c vyak@t ma:
good neg
‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) is not/was not/will not be good’
In 20.39d–e, vyak@t occurs with t@- as a support verb or as a copula (with the meaning of
‘become’)—and this support verb behaves as a normal verb, with all the appropriate tense and
other distinctions:
20.39d vyakat ma: t@
good neg sup.vb+neg
(a) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) is not/was not good’—support verb
(b) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) does not/did not become good’—copula clause

good sup.vb+neg neg
(a) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) will not be good’—support verb
(b) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) will not become good’—copula clause
We can recall, from §14.1.2 (also see the discussion above), that 20.39d–e are ambiguous in
yet another way: the verb t@- with a non-verb may also be understood as a copula, ‘become’.","[546, 547, 548, 549, 550]"

‘I will be pouring (liquid) by moving it side to side (across and inward)’
A partially inﬂected verb is much simpler. There is a basic diﬀerence between imperatives
as partially inﬂected verbal forms, and all other uninﬂected verbs. The imperative obligatorily
takes either the preﬁx a- which triggers changes in the verb stem, or a special set of imperativeonly suﬃxes (see §13.2). A second person imperative is in 11.2, and a third person imperative is
in 11.3:
11.2 atak
impv+put
‘put (it down)!’
11.3 taka-kwa-d
put-impv.3p-masc.sg
‘may he put (it down)!’
A non-imperative partially inﬂected verb has just three positions, as shown in Scheme 11.3. All
of these are obligatory, if the given meaning is to be expressed.
An example is under 11.4:
11 311.4 taka-tu-k@k
put-1sg-purp.ds
‘so that I put (it down)’
Non-tensed and tense-sensitive subject cross-referencing markers are listed in Table 11.2
(repeated from Table 3.2). They are in part identical. The main diﬀerence lies in the absence
of ﬁnal vowel in ﬁrst and second person singular non-tensed forms. In dual and plural, the
non-tensed cross-referencing markers are identical with those denoting remote past tense.
The structure of an uninﬂected verb is straightforward: a suﬃx marking a category of an
uninﬂected verb attaches directly to the stem. In 11.5, the desiderative suﬃx -k@r attaches to a
verbal stem with positions (i) and (ii) ﬁlled:
11.5 [kay-kwa-taka]stem -k@r
manip-stay-put-des
‘(I/you/(s)he/we/they want to pour’
The negative declarative non-habitual stands apart from other verb forms in the language.
For some verbs it coincides with the verb’s root, e.g. k@- ‘eat’, ma: k@ (neg eat+neg) ‘do(es) not24811 Predicate Structure and Verb Root TypesTable 11.2 Non-tensed subject cross-referencing set in partially inﬂected verbs compared with

‘do(es) not say’ (see §11.3). The corresponding negative future coincides with the verb root, e.g.
k@ ma: ‘will not eat’, wa ma: ‘will not say’. (But note that the negator is placed after the verb
root—see §14.1.1.)
Uninﬂected verbs used in main clauses—with the exception of the negatives and the
prohibitives—require a support verb if they head the predicate of a non-main clause, or
if additional tense, aspect, or mood/modality speciﬁcations are to be provided. Such forms
include completive aspect (§12.6), customary aspect (§12.7), same-subject purposive (§13.4.1),
desiderative (§13.5), frustrative (§13.6), and also verbs marked with suﬃxes -r@b ‘fully’ and
-d@ka ‘only’ (§9.2; §12.8.1).The support is normally t@- ‘be, have, stand’. The only exception
is the completive aspect which requires na- ‘copula for abstract states’. This is a feature
uninﬂected verbs share with nominals, and with deverbal nominalizations (see §9.1.1, and
§17.2.1). Reduplicated verbs and forms of the customary aspect (see 4.47–8, and §12.7, §12.8.2)
can be used either as inﬂected or as uninﬂected verbs.
Manambu presents a clear example of dependencies between various grammatical categories. Gender, number, and person distinctions are neutralized in negative declarative and
prohibitive clauses; so are all aspect and modality meanings—just as predicted by Aikhenvald
and Dixon (1998). All the modalities, aspects, and tenses are distinguished in positive declarative main clauses.
Habitual forms behave diﬀerently from non-habitual ones: when they are negated, there
is no neutralization of person, number, and gender. And there is no habitual imperative—
the habitual meaning (and marking) does not occur in commands. Along similar lines, a verb
marked with the suﬃx -tu- ‘complete involvement of S/O’ does not occur in imperatives, or in
any uninﬂected verbs. In contrast to the habitual, a verb marked with -tu- cannot be negated.
No aspect or modality categories can be marked in imperative clauses—this is typologically quite common. Non-indicative moods and modalities, and aspectual meanings—such as
habitual, customary, or completive—are mutually exclusive. This may reﬂect the fact that the
choice of aspect depends on mood, and on modality. This type of dependency requires further
investigation.","[273, 274, 275]"
"10.1 Personal Pronouns199A fully reduplicated pronoun has an emphatic meaning roughly translatable as ‘oneself’, e.g.
ñ@n-a-ñ@n ‘you (feminine) yourself, really you, as for you’, wun-a-wun ‘I myself; really me, as for
me’. A fully reduplicated singular third person pronoun requires the oblique marker -k@-, as in
d@-k@-d@-k@ (he-obl-he-obl) ‘he himself’. As is typical for VkV syllables (process A3 in §2.6),
the middle syllable -k@- is elided in normal to fast speech, and one frequently hears d@-d@-k@
‘he himself’ (as in 10.10, 10.11, and 10.15). Interestingly, the oblique -k@- does not occur on
third person dual pronouns (10.4)—we can recall that the linker -k@- is obligatorily used with
any non-plural non-reduplicated third person pronoun.
This emphatic meaning of full reduplication is a speciﬁc feature of pronouns as a word
class. An emphatic pronoun can occur in any function in a clause. In 10.4, it is used to mark
possessor, and in 10.5 it marks addressee.

In 10.15, it marks the A and the O. The two meanings of an emphatic reduplicated personal
pronoun—that of emphasis and that of ownership—may not be distinguishable, as in 10.6:
10.6 d@-k@-d@-ka
ta:kw ma:
he-lk-he-lk+dem.dist+fem.sg wife neg
‘He himself had no wife’ (lit. ‘His own wife did not (exist)’, or ‘As for him, there was no
wife’)
When a reduplicated pronoun appears in the predicate slot, it does not take any personal
cross-referencing. As shown in 10.7, it can take the conﬁrmation marker -@k:
r@-tua
10.7 wun-a-wun-@k k@ka
I-lk-I-conf
dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg sit-1sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It is me myself, I am here sitting’
Reduplicated personal pronouns translate into Tok Pisin with a particle yet (as in em yet ‘he
himself’, yu yet ‘you yourself’). Speakers who frequently code-switch into Tok Pisin employ
the particle yet (underlined), as in 10.8. This was corrected as 10.9, by another speaker:
r@-ñ@n-@k
10.8 ñ@n yet væn

10.9 ñ@n-a-ñ

r@-ñ@n-@k
you.fem-lk-you.fem see+seq sit-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf

Some speakers from Malu village employ both a reduplicated personal pronoun and the Tok
Pisin particle yet:

yet m@y-a-m@y-a ap-a-nagudaw-ad

‘He himself is a very true member of real Nagudaw clan’20010 Closed ClassesThis phenomenon whereby native and borrowed grammatical forms appear together is known
as lexical/grammatical parallelism (see Hajek 2006 for Tetun Dili; Aikhenvald forthcoming c).
This is how foreign forms make their way into the language, in a situation which appears to
disfavour a downright replacement of native forms with foreign insertions.
The semantic analogy between the reduplicated personal pronouns must have contributed to
an extension of reduplicated pronouns to mark reﬂexive, as in 10.11 which describes a suicide.
Such examples are rare.

An alternative to emphatic personal pronouns as markers of co-referential possession is the
adverb ka:p ‘own’, as in kapa kagr@s (own+lknephew) ‘one’s own nephew’. Further ways of
expressing reﬂexive meanings are discussed in §16.2.4.10.2 de m o n s t rat i v e s
Manambu has three demonstrative roots, k@- ‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and a- ‘distal demonstrative (far from both)’. These
roots occur in nominal demonstratives also used as spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1),
in manner adverbial demonstratives (§10.2.2), and in reactivated topic demonstratives (§10.2.3).
Of all demonstratives, only nominal demonstratives distinguish additional distance (as shown
in Table 10.1 below) and directions.","[225, 226, 227]"

‘Here is your food’ (pointing) (I have just put it here; it is here right now)

The implication is that the food has been here for some time, and its place is here.

We have already seen (20.49b) that a verbless clause may have an overtone of spontaneity. It
appears to be also the case in instances like 20.52a.
iii. Summarizing a preceding stretch of discourse can be achieved through using an adverbial
demonstrative on its own, in a verbless clause (and without a predicative marker), as in 20.53a.
An alternative is to use the word ‘manner’ in a similar structure—another verbless clause:
20.53a akatawa
thus
‘This is how it is’
20.53b akatawa sa:d
thus
way
‘This way (it is)’
An alternative for each of these would be either a predicative form of adverbial demonstrative (akatawa-n-a for 20.53a), or a non-verbal clause (akatawa sa:d-a for 20.53b). The verbless
versions sound more spontaneous and informal.
iv. Verbless clauses are used in a presentational function, as in T1.2.
v. Verbless clauses are used in questions (see C below) which involve manner and are marked
with the question words ata ata ‘how how’, as in 10.100, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’,
as in 10.98. Verbless clauses are also employed in questions involving naming, as in 10.102 and
20.54:
20.54 ata maway s@?
how ﬂower name
‘What’s the name of the ﬂower?’
Verbless clauses are also used in short questions used to enquire after someone: 20.55 is the
way of asking a child about his or her mother and father—that is, where they are, are they OK,
and so on:
20.55 amæy? asa:y?
mother father
‘(What about) mother? Father?’
A similar example is at 20.58—this is a question addressed to unknown beings in order to
ﬁnd out what food they would be capable of eating.
The interrogative pronoun ak@- ‘where’ (as in Table 10.7, example 10.90) is used in nonverbal clauses, since it requires non-verbal cross-referencing.
If negated, verbless clauses are indistinguishable from non-verbal ones: 20.56 is a negative
version of both a non-verbal clause l@ T@k@ta:y-a (she Teketay-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is Teketay’
and a verbless clause l@ T@k@ta:y ‘she is Teketay’:52820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.56 l@ T@k@ta:y ma:

Table 20.1 summarizes the properties which diﬀerentiate between copula clauses, verbless
clauses, and two types of clauses with non-verbal predicates—those involving demonstratives
with the predicative marker -n- and the rest.
The arguments in favour of considering non-verbal clauses as a separate type of clauses
headed by non-verbs are: (a) kind of cross-referencing markers used, or lack thereof; (b)
negation; (c) tense distinctions expressed with cross-referencing; (d) occurrence in subordinate
clauses and in non-indicative moods; (e) semantics; (f) use in highlighting focus constructions;
and (g) constituent order.
Unlike copula clauses—which are similar to normal verbal clauses in all but their (lack of)
capacity to form commands—they are negated in the same, non-verbal, way, and have a strictly
subject-predicate order (see §20.2). Clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives
in the predicate slot share more properties with verbless clauses than they do with non-verbal
clauses.
But how do we identify grammatical relations, especially in verbless clauses? This is to be
taken up in §20.1.4.
B. Imperative clauses are always independent, and contain partially inﬂected imperativepermissive forms discussed in §13.2. Copula clauses, clauses with non-verbal predicates, and
verbless clauses cannot occur in imperative clauses. Some verbs—such as perception verbs—
have a telic meaning when used in commands; that is, 20.57 can only mean ‘you listen’ rather
than ‘you hear’ or ‘you understand’. (A loan verb understand was used in a command urging a
child to understand what the mother was saying and to act accordingly, in 17.26b.) We return
to the ways in which ‘see’ and ‘hear’ are used in commands in §21.1.2.
The ways in which imperatives can be negated were addressed in §14.4. An imperative
strategy can be used in lieu of an imperative-permissive form—see Table 19.5, to express
additional overtones to do with strength of the command.
The constituent order in imperative clauses follows the same principles as that in declarative
clauses (see §20.2): it is predominantly verb ﬁnal, but a constituent can be postposed to the
verb for disambiguation or if the participant is unexpected (see T1.16).
Imperative clauses have a rising intonation on the verb, if they imply a command, and even
if used as a turn-taking device, as in 20.57.
20.57 b@r
awuk
you.du impv+listen
‘You (two) listen!’
Permissive forms (see §13.2.2), which are often used in turn taking, tend to be pronounced with
an interrogative rising intonation—see C below.
C. Interrogative clauses correspond to either polar or content questions. We mentioned in
§10.4 that content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation,
while polar questions are marked by intonation only. There is no structural diﬀerence between
a positive polar question and a corresponding statement. Only the intonation and the context
decides. Some examples are at 10.79 and further examples in §10.4, 20.14–15, the last clauses of
T1.4 and T1.18, and the ﬁrst clause of T1.14. The last clause of T2.26 contains an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ cast as a question.","[553, 554, 555]"

‘Peanuts coming up’ in 9.1 and ‘sago eating’ in 9.2 are diﬀerent from possessive constructions
of type B (§8.1.1), for two reasons. First, given the right pragmatic circumstances, another
possessive construction (types C–E) can replace a B-type possessive construction. In contrast,
no possessive construction can be used instead of an action-nominalization structure. Secondly,
an object of a nominalization can take the accusative-locative case if fully aﬀected, as in 4.7. In
all of 9.1–2 and 4.7–8 nominalizations are employed as complementation strategies (see IX in
§19.8).
An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in 9.3 (predicate is focused: see
§20.3).
k@-k@-l-a
9.3 k@
lap
kwa:j
dem.prox+fem.sg banana ﬂying.fox eat-red-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
‘This is the way of eating of bananas by ﬂying fox’
As can be seen from these examples, nominalizations are assigned feminine gender, in
accordance with its functionally unmarked character (see §5.2.3).
Nominalizations are frequently used as modiﬁers to nouns, e.g. vya-vy-a ta:b (hit+lk-redlk hand) ‘right hand, lit. hitting hand’, wusau-wusau s@p (itch-red skin) ‘itchy skin’, væt-@væt-@j @pis (bite-lk-red-lk ant) ‘an ant that bites a lot’. An alternative interpretation for these
constructions as analogous to relative clauses is in §19.2.2.
II. Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used to mark a purpose, or a goal expressed
with what translates as a clausal complement. These are used where one expects the dativeaversive case, as in 9.4 and 13.81–2.
9.4 kap@-n kwa-na
[n@k@-di ñanugw ya-ya:k]
wait-seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt other-pl children come-red+dat
‘She is waiting for the other children to come’ (lit. she is waiting for other children coming)
The dative-aversive marked nominalizations are used with a variety of expressions with
negative meaning, such as ‘forbid, refuse’, literally, ‘say no’, as in 9.5, or ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6.
ma: wa-na-wun
9.5 [m@n
kap@-ka:p da-da:k]

9.6 [k@-ka:k]
d@ wap
sayid
eat-red+dat he shame feel+3masc.sgbas.vt
‘He felt ashamed to eat’9.1 Word class-changing derivations181This is in line with the aversive meaning of the -Vk case. The nominalizations are also used
in a more clearly aversive, ‘for fear of’, sense, as in 9.7:
9.7 [ank@l s@p kag@l yi-ya:k]
marasin-al
nettle skin sore go-red+dat medicine-3fem.sgnom
‘Nettle is a medicine against sore skin’ (lit. nettle is a medicine for fear of skin going sore)
Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used in yet another sense—that of future projection, as in 9.8.
9.8 [l@-k@-d@
ñan kiya-kiya:k] atawa kur@-d
she-lk-masc.sg child die-red+dat thus do-3masc.sgbas.p
‘It (the cat) was acting like this (as a premonition) for her little boy dying’
We saw that a nominalization unmarked for case can be used with the expression ‘be hard’ in
4.7 where the diﬃculty is not limited to the future. If a future diﬃculty is implied, a dativeaversive-marked nominalization is employed:
9.9 [apaw@l b@u-m
t@-na]
[ [al@k
suan
spirit
haze-loc stay-act.foc+3fem.sg.bas.vt this.is.why hard
yi-na-wun]
[apaw@l-a:m v@-væk] ]
go-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt spirit-lk+acc see-red+dat
‘A spirit is in a haze, this is why it is hard for me to (try and) see the spirit (in future)’
The dative-aversive nominalization can be considered a type of complementation strategy
(§19.8). Unlike other complementation strategies, they often follow the inﬂected verb. This
same form is also used in clauses introduced with k@pa:b ‘in case’—see §13.7.
Dative-aversive nominalizations can be derived from any verb, with the exception of verbs
of C@l/r structure. So, the verb b@l-/bla- ‘talk’ forms a nominalization blab@l ‘talking’; but
not ∗ blabl@k; the same-subject purposive bla:k is used instead (see §13.4). Such gaps in the
paradigm of dative-aversive nominalizations show that their morphological possibilities do not
fully coincide with those of nominalizations discussed at I above. This could be an argument
in favour of analysing them as a separate category.
III. Terminative case-marked nominalizations marked with Vb can only be used with the
polyfunctional verb t@- as support verb. The meaning of the construction is ‘to be on the brink
of doing something; to do just so’:
kui-kuib
t@-na-dian
9.10 ñ@n-a-d@
majan
you.fem-lk-masc.sg funerary.ritual give-red+term have/be-act.foc-1plbas.vt
‘We are about to oﬀer you a funerary rite (because we thought you were dead)’
The support verb can be omitted, if its subject is coreferential with that of a juxtaposed
clause:
9.11 [kuprap-@ du taba:m
r@-ku]
[ya:n]
[r@-tua
bad-lk
man hand+lk+loc sit-compl.ss come+seq sit-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
kiya-kiya:b]
aka
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg die-red+term
‘Sitting in the bad man’s hands, having come, here I sit, on the brink of dying’1829 Derivation and CompoundingThe meanings of -Vb with nominalizations agree with the general semantics of the terminative
case (see §7.6). Noun phrases marked with terminative case are typically used as obliques,
unlike nominalizations with the same marking.
IV. Nominalizations as parts of complex predicates with the verb t@- ‘be, stand, have’ as
a support verb have an intensive and habitual meaning, as in 9.12. Compare 9.12a, with an
inﬂected verb, and 9.12b, with a nominalization as part of a complex predicate.
9.12a day-a:k
warsamad
they-lk+dat be.angry+3masc.sgbas.vt
‘He is angry at them’
9.12b day-a:k
warsam-warsam t@-na-d
they-lk+dat be.angry-red
be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘He is very angry at them’
The verb bla means ‘speak; say magic spells’; a person who keeps saying magic spells is called
yanu bla-b@l t@-kwa-na-d-@ du (spell say-red stand/have-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk man).
Similarly, wuk@mar means ‘forget’, wuk@mar wuk@mar t@- means ‘be forgetful’.
The meaning of a reduplicated nominalization may be only partially predictable: for
instance, reduplicated r@p ‘be full, satisﬁed’ within a complex predicate means ‘equal, same
as’, as in 4.47.
An analytical problem arises here. At the end of §4.2.2 we mentioned multiple word class
membership of fully reduplicated verbal roots. Most of them can be used as inﬂected verbs
(in which case they are interpreted as intensive aspect forms: see §12.8), and also as parts of
complex predicates. This was illustrated with examples 4.47–8; also see 9.13a–b:
t@-na-di
9.13a a-di
pato wali-wali
dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red be-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Those ducks keep wandering around’
9.13b a-di
pato wali-wali-na-di
dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Those ducks are wandering around all the time’
For dynamic verbs, like wali- ‘wander around’, there appears to be a subtle diﬀerence:
nominalizations as parts of complex predicates refer to an atemporal action that keeps repeating, while inﬂected verbs describe something that is happening either right now or at some
particular time (this is why the action focus marker is preferred in examples like 9.13a–b). For
stative verbs there is no such diﬀerence.
In addition, a reduplicated verb root can occur as part of a complex predicate with support
verbs other than t@- ‘be, stand’, with the basic meaning of action nominalization. The noise
of rolling is described in 9.14, and this warrants the use of the polyfunctional verb na- ‘be (of
natural phenomena, including noise)’:
9.14 t@m@l-t@m@l ata na:l
roll-red
then be:nat+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘There was a noise of (him) rolling and rolling’9.1 Word class-changing derivations183The reduplicated root triggers feminine agreement, like any nominalization in S function.
Examples like 9.14 are infrequent; nevertheless, they point towards a diﬀerent nature of reduplicated verb roots with a support verb and verbal nominalizations.
V. Emphatic nominalizations are used as manner modiﬁers to a semantically similar (or the
same) verb, as in 9.15.
9.15 wuk@-wuk wuk@-tua
hear-red hear-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am just listening’ (not saying anything; lit. listening I listen)
The emphatic nominalization constructions often have a frustrative connotation: in 9.16
there is an overt contrast between ‘just hearing’ and ‘really talking’.
9.16 wuk@-wuk wuk@-na
yi-yi
suan yi-na
hear-red hear-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt talk-red hard go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She does hear (understand) (the language), talking is diﬃcult’ (lit. hearing she hears,
talking is diﬃcult)
A nominalization containing a diﬀerent, but semantically similar, root can modify a verb,
denoting a manner in which the action is performed, as in 9.17:
9.17 væs@-væs ma:y
step-red go.impv
‘Go by stepping carefully’
Just occasionally can a reduplicated verb root be used to modify a verb of a diﬀerent
semantic group, as in 9.18:
9.18 wiya:m
aw
t@m@l-t@m@l aw
t@m@l-t@m@l ata gra:l
house+lk+loc in.turn roll-red
in.turn roll-red
then cry+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘At home she then cried in turn rolling and rolling (lamenting her drowned son)’
VI. Nominalizations in negative constructions as predicate heads are a means of expressing
negative obligation. This is consistent with a typologically widely attested pattern whereby
non-verbal forms are used to express curt commands and strong prohibitions (Aikhenvald
forthcoming a). In 9.19, the mother was trying to explain to her baby daughter that one does
not breastfeed while walking along the road:
9.19 yab@-wa
m@ñ k@-k@ ma:
road+lk-com breast eat-red neg
‘One does not breastfeed while walking’ (lit. There is no breastfeeding along the road)
Such negative statements can refer to something that has not happened yet (as in 9.19 said
before the girl had started breastfeeding—see 7.80), or to something that has already occurred.
The position of the negator is congruent with its position in clauses with a non-verbal
predicate (see §14.1.2). However, an additional problem arises here. We will see in §14.3.3 that
the negative form of the reduplicated intensive aspect of a verb coincides with the reduplicated
verb stem, that is, a nominalization. In negative future, the negator is postposed to the negative
form of an inﬂected verb, making a construction like 9.20 (and in T1.7) inherently ambiguous
between (a) a negated nominalization as a means of expressing negative obligation; and (b) a
negative future of the intensive aspect.","[206, 207, 208, 209, 210]"

-dPerson-marking enclitics whose only role is to cross-reference the subject of a verbless clause
with a non-verb as a predicate head are given in Table 3.4. The segmental make-up of the
markers is almost identical with the basic cross-referencing set in Table 3.1.
The diﬀerence lies (a) in that the markers in Table 3.4 are enclitics and the ones in Table 3.1
are suﬃxes (see §§2.5–6 on the diﬀerences between these), and (b) in the existence of free
variants of ﬁrst and third person singular feminine forms. The vowel a in the forms in Table
3.4 can be considered a kind of linker; note its absence with the suﬃxes.
Example 3.12 illustrates an adjective, and 3.13 an adverb as head of intransitive predicates.
3.12 a-di
ja:p kuprap=adi
dem.dist-pl thing bad=3plnom
‘These things are bad’
3.13 yabi:b-yabi:b=ad
quickly-quickly=3masc.sgnom
‘It (the way he is moving) is very quickly’
In 2.1–2 nouns were used as predicate heads. These same enclitics mark focused constituents,
in highlighting focus constructions (see §20.3).
The choice between cross-referencing just the subject or also an additional participant on a
Manambu verb is largely independent of the verb’s transitivity: both transitive and intransitive
verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments.
Importantly, the number of arguments cross-referenced correlates with the grammatical
categories of the verb. The option of either one or two cross-referencing positions is available
for independent positive indicative declarative and interrogative clauses, positive and negative habitual declarative and interrogative clauses, relative clauses, and dependent juxtaposed
clauses (both negative and positive). See examples 3.1–10 above. Such forms are fully inﬂected
for person (see §11.1.1; Table 11.1). Only one cross-referencing position is available for all these
clauses if the verb contains the action focus marker -na-. Causal clauses and all diﬀerent-subject
medial clauses also cross-reference just the subject (with the non-tensed suﬃxes in Table 3.2).
The imperative has its own paradigm of subject cross-referencing (see §13.2). All these forms
are partially inﬂected.","[90, 91]"

Introduction: The Language and its Speakers
Manambu belongs to the Ndu language family, and is spoken by about 2,500 people in
ﬁve villages: Avatip, Yawabak, Malu, Apa:n, and Yambon (Yuanab) in East Sepik Province,
Ambunti district. About 200–400 speakers live in the cities of Port Moresby, Wewak, Lae, and
Madang; a few people live in Kokopo and Mount Hagen.1.1 l i n g u i s t i c ty p e
Manambu is synthetic, with elements of fusion, and predominantly suﬃxing. The imperative
marker a- is the only fully productive preﬁx (§13.2.1), while the causative-manipulative preﬁx
kay- occurs with a limited number of verbs (§16.2.1). The inﬁx -ka- marks intensive forms of
non-agreeing adjectives (§4.3).
Manambu has twenty consonants and nine vowels. There is a series of simple voiced and
voiceless bilabial, apico-dental, and dorso-velar stops (just like in other Ndu languages). Voiced
and voiceless bilabial and dorso-velar stops also have a labialized counterpart. All the voiced
stops and the voiced fricative j are prenasalized in word-initial, intervocalic, and word-ﬁnal
positions. Vowel length is contrastive. Long vowels a: and æ: are a recent innovation: older
speakers still pronounce these as sequences of identical short vowels interrupted by a glottal
stop. Syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C). Stress is movable and contrastive. Long vowels tend to
be stressed (Chapter 2).
Open classes are nouns and verbs. Nominal categories include case, three numbers, and two
genders in the singular. Grammatical relations are expressed with verbal cross-referencing and
with nominal case marking. Manambu has nine case forms, more than any other Ndu language. The subject case is formally unmarked. The same form marks locative and a deﬁnite and
fully involved object. Another form expresses direction and instrument. The dative case marks
beneﬁciary and maleﬁciary, and also has an aversive meaning, ‘for fear of’. The terminative
case means ‘on the very edge of’, and ‘up until’. Two cases mark ‘means of transportation’.
The substitutive case means ‘instead of’. The comitative case meaning ‘together with’ is
a major device for coordinating noun phrases. Its additional meanings are locative ‘along
(e.g. a road)’ and temporal ‘while’. Case markers may attach to verbal roots: the objectivelocative case marks completive aspect, dative case marks purpose, instrumental case derives
deverbal adverbs, and substitutive case marks dependent clauses meaning ‘instead of doing
something’.
Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing fused with tense, aspect, mood
(imperative-permissive, and irrealis), and modalities (optative, purposive, desiderative, and two
frustratives). The subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced on the verb. A second argument—
direct object, beneﬁciary, location, time, manner, or instrument—can be cross-referenced if
it is more topical than the subject. A copula complement, a speech report, and a comitative constituent are never cross-referenced. Members of word classes other than verbs take21 Introductioncross-referencing enclitics when they occupy the predicate slot (Chapters 3–4). This is unlike
most other Ndu languages which cross-reference only the subject.
A small closed class of agreeing adjectives has three members, ‘big’, ‘small’, and ‘ﬁne’; these
agree in gender and number with the head noun. About sixteen non-agreeing adjectives—
which cover semantic types such as value, dimension, colour, and age—share a number of
properties with nouns. Adverbs and time words are semi-closed classes which share a few
properties with nouns. Word class-changing derivations are limited.
A striking property of Manambu is its gender system. Two genders, masculine and feminine,
are assigned to nouns according to their referents’ sex and also shape and size. That is, a
large house is masculine, and a small house feminine. Genders are covert in the sense that,
rather than being marked on the noun itself, they appear on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and adverbial demonstratives, and in possessive constructions. The feminine gender is both
formally and functionally unmarked (Chapter 5).
Three numbers—singular, dual, and plural—are marked on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and in possessive constructions. Plural and dual are marked on most kinship terms and on
a few nouns with a human referent. Associative non-singular (X and his/her associates) is
restricted to just personal names (Chapter 6). The choice between ﬁve types of possessive
construction depends on the type of possessive relationship, of possessee, and of possessor
(Chapter 8).
The system of demonstratives is unusually intricate. Three demonstrative roots, k@‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa- ‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and
a- ‘distal demonstrative’, are used in nominal demonstratives, in manner adverbial demonstratives, and in reactivated topic demonstratives. Nominal demonstratives express either spatiotemporal deixis or ‘current relevance’. The latter are derived from the former with the suﬃx
-na- ‘current relevance’, indicating that the object of pointing is being talked about, or is of
immediate or ongoing importance to the speakers. Spatio-temporal demonstratives distinguish
gender and number, and may also distinguish either three additional degrees of distance, or
ﬁve directions. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish ﬁve directions, and two additional degrees of distance, but no number or gender. Reactivated topic demonstratives refer
predominantly to an S/O constituent (Chapter 10).
Negation is marked diﬀerently depending on aspect, tense, mood, and modality. Nonhabitual negative indicative clauses have no person marking. All dependent clauses are negated
diﬀerently from main clauses. Three prohibitives diﬀer in their illocutionary force.
Manambu has a productive system of verbal compounds (they can be alternatively analysed
as one-word serial verbs: Chapter 15). They express manner, aspectual and sequential meanings, and function as valency-changing devices. Many are lexicalized and have idiomatic
meanings.
Verbs divide into several subclasses depending on whether they can occur with directional
markers, and which directional markers they occur with. Inherently directional verbs
include the six basic verbs war- ‘go upwards’, da- ‘go downwards’, væki- ‘go across (away from
the speaker)’, væra- ‘go across (towards speaker)’, wula- ‘enter, come in, come in a direction
from the Sepik River’, and waku- ‘go out (including motion in direction away from the Sepik
River)’. These do not take any further directional speciﬁcations. Their roots are the base
for directional markers on other verbs, and on demonstratives. Intrinsically directional
verbs include four roots which must take directional suﬃxes, each of which corresponds
to an inherently directional verb. The majority of verbs are optionally directional. They
combine with bound forms consisting of s@- followed by a directional marker. Copula verbs,1.1 Linguistic type3the general motion verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’, and ingestive and stative verbs do not combine
with any directionals. Directionals also have a valency-increasing eﬀect. Directionals on verbs
and on demonstratives have similar origins, but display subtle diﬀerences in their semantics
(Chapter 16).
Manambu has a semi-productive causative-manipulative preﬁx kay- which causativizes a
limited set of intransitive verbs. When applied to transitive verbs, it indicates a special physical
eﬀort and the intensity of action. There is no passive. Instead, Manambu employs transitivityneutralizing constructions which involve clause chaining, and are ambiguous as to their status
as biclausal or as monoclausal. A reciprocal marker awarwa has an associative meaning
‘together with’. Reﬂexive meanings are expressed with a variety of means none of which
involves a verbal derivation (§16.2).
Ten polyfunctional verbs can each be used as an auxiliary or as a support verb, and also
as a copula verb (Table 4.1, and Chapter 17). Auxiliary verb constructions express aspectual,
positional, and modal meanings. There are also a variety of idiomatic complex predicates. Body
part constructions—expressing emotional, mental, and physical states—are a special subtype
thereof.
Clause linking in Manambu is achieved through a variety of means. The major strategy is
clause chaining via medial dependent clauses. In most cases this involves switch-reference (that
is, marking of dependent clauses may be sensitive to whether their subject (A/S) is the same as
that of the following clause or not). The tense and extent of action expressed in a medial clause
is determined by its relationship to the action of a subsequent dependent clause or a main
clause. There are also causal clauses, and ‘unlikely condition’ clauses. Other clause-linking
devices include juxtaposition of a dependent clause and a main clause (this is a preferred
manner of indicating conditional meanings); clause linking via a case marker ‘instead’ and
a suﬃx ‘like’, and clause linking involving connectives.
Relative clauses are similar to main clauses in most properties; they are negated like dependent clauses. Speech reports—direct, indirect, and ‘semi-direct’—are highly frequent. They
express a wide variety of meanings, including desire, fear, and reason. Manambu has no
complement clauses as a special clause type; instead, medial and other dependent clauses are
co-opted as complementation strategies (Chapters 18 and 19).
Constituent order in Manambu tends to be verb ﬁnal. It is often motivated by discourse
pragmatics. Word order within constituents depends on their type. For instance, quantiﬁers
can precede the noun head or follow it depending on the referent’s topicality. Chapter 20
oﬀers a comprehensive analysis of the principles of ordering words and constituents, and also
of the structure of constituents, and of clauses. An argument, or the predicate, can occur
in a highlighting focus construction. A focused constituent appears marked as a non-verbal
predicate head with the appropriate person markers, and the rest of the clause remains as it
was. Highlighting focus constructions may appear biclausal. A focused noun phrase has the
makings of a full verbless clause, since it contains the non-verbal cross-referencing markers.
However, it is not a full clause because it cannot be negated separately. Highlighting focus
constructions are an instance of grammar-in-the-making, similar to transitivity-neutralizing
constructions involving clause chaining (§19.9 and §20.3).
Manambu has a highly elaborate verbal and nominal lexicon. Typologically unusual semantic groups of verbs cover eating, drinking, and chewing, perception, and speech. Highly speciﬁc
terms coexist with highly generalized ones. A general noun ma:gw ‘whatever, whatchamacallit’
and a general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’ are an option, if one cannot think of the right term, or
prefers to be non-speciﬁc. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—tantamount to monetary41 Introductionriches—is viewed in terms of lexicon, especially the totemic names (which are nouns). The
issue of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). Multiple
‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—result in multiple synonymy. The totemic names
are used as address terms, as an integral part of Manambu speech etiquette, where the traditional patterns coexist with newly acquired Western imports.
In terms of the etymological make-up of its lexicon and grammar, Manambu is a central
member of the Ndu family. There are a number of loans from other languages of the area,
mostly Western Iatmul. Similarities between Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma are
contact induced. All the speakers of Manambu are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and many also
in English, and code-switching is pervasive. Signs of incipient language obsolescence look
ominous—however, a strong opposition to language loss gives room to hope that the language
will live.1.2 t he manambu: t h e p r e s e n t a n d t h e pa s t
The Manambu occupy ﬁve villages in the Ambunti District in the East Sepik Province
of Papua New Guinea (see Map). They live mostly on the Sepik River (Manambu ñab,
cf. Kwoma nabagey 1 ), and more precisely, on its section between the Hunstein Mountain range
and the Washkuk Hills. Avatip is the major village in terms of population, of physical size, of
ceremonial signiﬁcance, and of military exploits. We return to this in §1.2.2 and §1.4.
The Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma have been fortunate, in terms of attracting
high-quality anthropological research. Useful and highly informative accounts of the Manambu culture in Newton (1971), Bragge (1990), and especially Harrison (1983, 1985a–b, 1987,
1990a–b, 1993) contain anthropological analysis and innumerable insights into the cultural
and cognitive patterns of Manambu ritual and everyday life over the years. This is why this and
the following sections are limited to a very brief sketch of cultural background, with just the
information necessary for understanding the grammar which follows.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"
"2.6 Phonological processes55(d) A monosyllabic negative form of the verb (see §14.1) cliticizes to the negator ma: in normal
to rapid speech register if the negation and the verb are contiguous, e.g. má: r@ ‘not sit’, má:
t@ ‘not have/be/stand’. The construction má: kw@ ‘not stay’ can be alternatively pronounced
either as má: kw, or as má: ku. If the sequence is interrupted, the verb forms an independent
phonological word, as in ma: n@bay t@ (not yet have:neg) ‘I/you/he/she/etc. do not have (it) yet’.
(e) Two disyllabic words tend to procliticize to the following verb, or encliticize to
the preceding verb: (h)aká ‘here (feminine singular); reactivated topic’, (h)atá ‘then’.
When cliticized, they retain a secondary stress on their ﬁnal syllable, as in atà=wá:d
‘then he said’, kus@lál=akà ‘it (feminine) is ﬁnished here’. The sequence aká-n-akà
(dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘this topical; here it is, this is how it is’
can occur on its own; at the end of a story it cliticizes to the ﬁnal verb, e.g. kus´@-l=akànaka
(ﬁnish-3fem.sgbas.vt=dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘it is now ﬁnished’.
This is an instance of three grammatical words realized as one phonological word. The form
ata procliticizes to a second person imperative with a subsequent fusion of identical vowels
(see B3 in §2.6), as in ata ada (then sit.impv) ‘sit, stay, wait’ which is pronounced as [ata:""n dá]
or [ata""n da], ata-n aw (thus-pred impv+speak) ‘speak thus’ which is pronounced as [ata""naw].
(f) The demonstrative kl@m ‘here (feminine singular)’ can procliticize to ma:n ‘negation’,
forming one word kl@má:n ‘here not; it is not here’ (the consonant reduction of sequence of
identical consonants is addressed in B1 in §2.6 below).
(g) Monosyllabic adverbial modiﬁers encliticize to an adjective or a verb they modify, e.g.
vyákata=m@y (good=very) ‘very good’, máya=k@ p (go=just) ‘just go!’ Very occasionally, a
monosyllabic object gets procliticized to the verb, e.g. áy yi-kná-d (impv+‘do’ go/say-fut3masc.sgbas.vt) becomes [ayikn""an d] ‘he will say: “do!” (e.g. the cooking)’. In the two farewell
formulae, the manner adverb yara ‘well’ procliticizes to the imperative verb, as in yara=má:y
(well=go.impv) ‘goodbye’ (literally, go well: said by the person who is staying). In the response
by the person who is going, yara procliticizes to the imperative of the verb ‘stay’ and the two
identical vowels undergo vowel fusion (B3 under §2.6 below), as in yaradákw (from yara=adákw
well=stay.impv) ‘stay well’ (§21.5).
Special phonological processes apply on the boundary of cliticizeable morphemes. If a clitic
forms a phonological word with a root, the main stress does not shift, and long vowels do
not undergo reduction: compare tá:kw=a ‘it is a woman’ and takwá:k ‘to a woman’. This
constitutes evidence in favour of special status of clitic-containing words in Manambu (see
Aikhenvald 2002c, for a cross-linguistic perspective).2.6 ph o n o lo g i c a l p ro c e s s e s
Phonological processes occur on (A) aﬃx boundaries within a phonological word and on (B)
clitic boundaries within a sequence of clitics, or between a cliticized morpheme and its host.
The epenthetic glide insertion (C1) occurs on any boundary, be it a suﬃx boundary or a clitic
boundary.","[81, 82]"

What I call dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are obligatorily used in an additional
type of dependent conditional clause introduced by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ (most probably,
terminative case of k@p ‘just’). The meaning of such clauses is ‘in case VERB’ as in 13.88.
Unlike the examples above (especially 13.84–5), the verb does not have to have any negative
connotations.

Such forms are identical to dative-aversive nominalizations. However, like any non-main
clause forms they require a suﬃxed negator -ma:r-, albeit in a somewhat diﬀerent form (see
§14.3 and §14.5.1). The ways in which nominalizations are negated are discussed in §14.3.3.
This is an argument in favour of the reduplicated verbs marked with -k in ‘in case’ clauses
being special modal forms, homonymous with other, seemingly identical, forms.13.8 s ummary
Manambu is rich in modal forms. The imperative mood has three person sub-paradigms which
diﬀer from each other in their form, function, and semantics. The optative modality can be
formed on imperative, and on the irrealis.
The pervasive problem in distinguishing tenses and modalities in Manambu is that of
polysemy versus homophony. We have already discussed similar problems with cases, and will
return to the same problem in the lexicon, in Chapter 21. The irrealis forms are homophonous
with future, and can only be formally distinguished under negation. Same-subject purposive is
homophonous with dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations of light monosyllabic verbs;
again, the two are negated diﬀerently.
Dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations are used in main clauses, and as clausal complements. Their lookalikes express condition in dependent clauses meaning ‘in case (something
happens)’—that these are diﬀerent forms can only be seen in the ways they are negated.
The use of same- and diﬀerent-subject purposives in main clauses involves the process of
desubordination. The same process appears to be at work with dative-aversive case-marked
nominalizations used in an apprehensive meaning, that is, as warnings.
The desiderative modality is relatively unproblematic in terms of its semantics. In contrast,
frustrative oﬀers a choice between durative and non-durative, absent from any other modality.
Frustrative is the only modality which cannot be negated.","[323, 324]"

shallow’; value, such as perfect or strange; physical properties, human propensity, qualiﬁcation,
e.g. r @ p- ‘be enough’, and position. Adverbs are used for speed, while diﬃculty is covered
with nominals. Similarity is expressed with postpositional structures (see §4.5.2 on k@t@k ‘like’).
Quantiﬁcation is marked with quantiﬁers (§10.5). Ordinal and cardinal numbers are a special
class (§10.6.1). An exception is ta:y ‘ﬁrst’ which is an adverb.4.4 a dv e r b s
Adverbs form a semi-open heterogeneous class of over forty members. They do not have any
grammatical categories characteristic of other word classes. Their major syntactic function
is to modify verbs. Unlike manner arguments, adverbs are never cross-referenced on the
verb.
Many underived adverbs are monosyllabic, e.g. k@ p ‘just’, ma:k ‘personally, in person’, b@
‘already’, ma: ‘again’, ta:y ‘ﬁrst, preceding’, the reﬂexive-emphatic ka:p ‘oneself, by oneself’
(4.63; §16.2.4). Some are disyllabic, e.g. (ma:) n@bay ‘not yet’, walba:b ‘close’, wayway ‘maybe’,
jaujay ‘in a sloppy, incorrect way’, and arguably also the reciprocal marker awarwa (in itself, the
comitative case form of the noun awar ‘side, sideways direction’: see §16.2.4). A few adverbs
come from nouns, e.g. s@k ‘far’, from s@k ‘long distance’; ma:k ‘in person’, from ma:k ‘face,
person’ (as in 4.69), or gañ ‘last’, related to g@ñ ‘tail’ (4.60–2).
4.60 S@sawi ta:y, d@ gañ ata yi-b@r
Sesawi ﬁrst he last then go-3dubas.p
‘Sesawi went ﬁrst, he (Kamkudi) last’
The alternative form of the same adverb is g@ñ ‘last’ which coincides with the noun ‘tail’,
and could be a back formation from the noun in its use as modiﬁer, where it also means ‘last’,
e.g. g@ñ-a ta:kw (tail-lk woman) ‘last/non-ﬁrst wife’.
Adverbs may contain derivational suﬃxes which have the same segmental make-up as case
markers. The suﬃx -Vb is similar to the terminative case -Vb and is used to derive adverbs
from some nominals (which are typically used as copula complements), e.g. kwam-a:b (crazylk+term) ‘by mistake, not thinking’, s@k-a:b (far-lk+term) ‘far, from afar, to a far point’,
from noun phrases, e.g. kwasa-m@y-a-b (little+fem.sg-very-lk-term) ‘little by little; a little bit’,
from nouns, e.g. ta:l ‘past’, tal-a:b ‘long time ago’, and from other adverbs, e.g. k@ p ‘still, yet,
just’ (see §21.2.2), k@pa:b ‘in case’, awar ‘one-sidedly’, awar-@-b ‘in turn’.
This same formative occurs in some adverbs which do not appear to be derived (synchronically), e.g. waya:b ‘in very recent past; just now’; s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’. This formative also
occurs in nakamib ‘together’, from nak, nakam@y ‘one’. The meaning of this suﬃx is hardly
predictable; similarly to the terminative case, it is stressed.
The suﬃx -Vr is similar to the allative-instrumental case -Vr. Unlike the case suﬃx, it is not
stressed. It is used to derive adverbs from nouns, e.g. g´@ñ@r ‘later’ (cf. g@ñ ‘tail’; g@ñ´@r ‘to tail;
with tail’), from some non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mir ‘along’ (from s@mi ‘long’) and páp@r
‘a little later’ (from pa:p ‘short’) and from underived adverbs, e.g. ta:y ‘before, in front, ahead’,
tá:yir ‘previously; towards the front’; m@y ‘very’, m´@yir ‘really’.
This same formative appears in a few other adverbs, such as japwár ‘conveniently’, yapwur
‘quickly’. Note that the allative-instrumental case forms are reminiscent of adverbs in their
semantics and usage, especially if repeated, as in ab-á-r ab-á-r (head-lk-all head-lk-all)4.4 Adverbs101‘head ﬁrst’. The adverb kuk´@r ‘after, later’ is also used as a postposition (see §4.5.2). A
few inherently repeated adverbs are derived from verb roots, e.g. pakwúr pakwúr (hide+all
hide+all) ‘in a secretive way’ (from pa:kw- ‘be hidden’).
A formative -Vk, similar to the dative case marker -Vk, appears in mad@k mad@k ‘especially,
namely’. The comitative -wa appears to derive adverbs with the meaning of ‘all the referents’
from a few nouns, e.g. mi: ‘tree; high’, miy-awa ‘together; whole’, t@ p ‘village’, t@p-awa ‘the
whole village’ (see §7.9). A few derivational formatives occur on numbers (see §10.6.1) deriving
adverbs, e.g. -k@r@b ‘together’, as in v@ti-k@r@b ‘two together’. The formative -ta:y in b@ta:y
‘already’ may be cognate to the verbal cotemporaneous sequencing suﬃx -ta:y (§18.4). This
adverb is unusual in that it can occur with the verbal conﬁrmation marker -@k, beta:y@k ‘right
now, already’ (see §12.5). A few adverbs typically occur repeated, e.g. yapwur yapwur ‘quickly’,
or reduplicated, e.g. s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’, wayway, w@yw@yau ‘maybe’, and r @ka:r@k ‘properly’.
The adverbial derivational suﬃxes (none of which is productive, or semantically predictable)
are the only adverb-speciﬁc morphological property.
A few frequently used forms containing the suﬃx -@n ‘manner sequencing’ are on the
way towards becoming grammaticalized as adverbial manner modiﬁers (see §19.9). Examples include yi:n (go+seq) ‘all along’, as in ñikiñiki yi:n k@l@b say-na-di (red go+seq
dem.prox+fem.sg+term ﬁnish-act.foc-3plbas.vt) ‘red (colour) all along (the sheet) ﬁnishes
here’, kray-in (bring-seq) ‘up until’, and s@b@n-@n (return-seq) ‘back’, as in s@b@n-@n a-kray
(return-seq impv-take) ‘take (it) back!’ However, they have hardly any of the morphological
properties of the adverbs outlined in Table 4.4. They cannot be considered bona ﬁde members
of the class of adverbs despite their meanings and can be treated on a par with verbal forms,
with one proviso: they cannot be negated independently.
All three agreeing adjectives can be used adverbially (that is, to modify a verb, or an
adjective)—see 4.53 above. The agreeing value adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ forms part of a derived
adverb yara-kara (which contains a formative not found anywhere else in the language).
Just like verbs, nouns, and adjectives, all adverbs can be heads of intransitive predicates.
Most adverbs can be modiﬁers in noun phrases. They do not require a linker, e.g. bas wari
(ﬁrst ﬁght) ‘ﬁghting for the ﬁrst time’, ta:yir ñaj (early+adv father’s.brother) ‘the father’s
brother (who was here) earlier’, ta:y ta:kw (early/precedingly woman) ‘ﬁrst wife’ (also see
4.77, ‘previous hole’), miya-wa du (tree+lk-com man) ‘all the men; all men together’ (also
see 15.100).
Table 4.4 features a comparison of morphological properties and syntactic functions of
adverbs with the three other major word classes—nouns, verbs, and adjectives (see Table 4.2).
1. Negation. If an adverb is the head of an intransitive predicate, it is negated just like a
noun or an adjective in the same function: the negator ma: is placed after the predicate head
(which has no person markers); and no tense distinctions are made, e.g. s@k ma: (far neg) ‘it
is not far’—as a general statement which can refer to present, past, or future. If tense has to
be expressed, then a verbal negative construction with the copula (most often t@-) is used. See
§§14.1.1–2.
2. Compounding is typically not found with adverbs—a property they share with agreeing
adjectives. Just occasionally does an adverb form a compound, e.g. ab-a-gañ (head-lk-last)
‘very last’.
3. Reduplication of adverbs has an ‘intensive’ meaning, e.g. ka:p ‘alone, by oneself’ (also used
as a reﬂexive marker: §16.2.4), kap@-ka:p ‘really alone’, and also as in 4.61:1024 Word ClassesTable 4.4 Morphological properties and syntactic functions of adverbs in comparison with other

4. Semantics of -p@k ‘like’ when it occurs with adverbs is similar to that with nouns and verbs,
e.g. miy-a-wa-p@k (tree-lk-com-like) ‘as if all, like it were all’, yabib-a-p@k (quickly-lk-like)
‘as if it were quick’. This suﬃx is not used with most monosyllabic and disyllabic adverbs.
5. The infix -ka- ‘intensive’ is used with just two adverbs: ka:p ‘on one’s own’, kap@-ka-ka:p
‘absolutely on one’s own’, and k@ p ‘just; for nothing’, k@ p-@-ka-k@ p ‘well and truly for nothing’.
6–7. An adverb can modify a verb, as shown in 4.63; this is a function adverbs share with
adjectives. An adverb can modify a nominal copula complement, but not an adjective.
8. An adverb can be a copula complement, e.g. k@p kwa-na-d (just stay-act.foc3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘he just stays, stays for nothing’. Some such constructions have idiomatic
meanings, e.g. ma:k kwa- (in.person stay) ‘be born’.
9–10. Just like a verb, an adverb cannot be head of an NP or an argument. An adverb can
be modiﬁed by m@yir—just like a verb, e.g. m@yir yapwur yapwur ma:j bla-kwa-na (real+adv4.5 Closed classes103quickly quickly talk speak-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she speaks really fast’. This is the
only instance of an adverb modifying another adverb. One adverb, gañ ‘last’, can be modiﬁed
by m@y- ‘real, very’, just like a noun or an adjective, as in 4.62:
4.62 ada
gañ kwa:d
m@y-a-gañ
dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg last stay+3masc.sgbas.p real-lk-last
‘Then he stayed there last, really last (the very last)’
As shown in Table 4.4, adverbs share some properties with nouns and adjectives, and some
with verbs. Adverbs can be positioned anywhere in a clause (unless they modify a noun, in
which case they precede that noun). A clause can contain up to three adverbs in the corpus
collected, as shown in 4.63 (adverbs are in bold):
4.63 a-di
t@p
ka:p aba:b b@
kiya-di
dem.dist-pl village alone all
already die-3plbas.p
‘Those (of) the village already all died by themselves’
This is a unique syntactic property of adverbs: a clause or an NP cannot contain more than
two modiﬁers of other sorts. Some connectives are connected with demonstratives (see §4.5.3).4.5 c lo s e d c la s s e s
Closed classes in Manambu include (a) personal pronouns (Table 3.3 and §10.1); (b) demonstratives (§10.2); (c) indeﬁnites (§10.3); (d) interrogatives (§10.4); (d) quantiﬁers, e.g, sama:sam
‘many, much’ (§10.5); and (e) numerals (§10.6). All of these, with the exception of demonstrative
and interrogative adverbs, are similar to nominals in most properties. They diﬀer in the
amount of nominal morphology they take; in their position within a noun phrase; and in their
syntactic functions (whether they can be heads of intransitive predicates, copula complements,
or modiﬁers). Demonstrative and interrogative adverbs do not take nominal cross-referencing
sets when they head a predicate.
Further closed classes are modal verbs, postpositions, emphatic particle, connectives, hortative, interjections, and onomatopoeia.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"
"22.2 The Kwoma–Manambu relationship595A potential cognate for ata ‘negator for purposives and desideratives’ is Gala woda; however,
this requires further study. We are thus left with a problem for which no adequate solution can
at present be provided.
Negation in Manambu is particularly problematic for morphological reconstruction. The
marking and wealth of forms are quite unusual for a Ndu language (see Chapter 14). In
particular, the negator ma: (or its variant ma:n) has few easily identiﬁable cognates in other
languages. One of these is -man in Iatmul subordinate negator -lapman; cf. also Gala map
‘negative imperative’.
Most Ndu languages other than Manambu employ the formative -ka- as a negator (e.g.
Gala kafá ‘not, there is not’; Abelam kaapuk ‘no, not’, and Iatmul kay ‘no’). We can recall,
from §14.6, that Manambu has an inherently negative adverb kapi sapi ‘no way’ used as a
negative response and a negative pro-clause. This could well be an alliterative compound based
on the root kapi cognate to these negators (its variants are sapi kapi or just kapi). In addition,
a proximate demonstrative k@ in contrastive focus (ka, kal (dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) or kad
(dem.prox+3masc.sgnom) ) can be used as an emphatic negator, as in 10.24, 18.26, 14.41, and
14.148. Speakers consistently translate this as a demonstrative, but we cannot rule out that this
form is in fact a remnant of a Proto-Ndu negator with a velar in the ﬁrst syllable, ultimately
cognate with kapi. Once again, we are faced with a puzzle.
As in most language families of the world, some parts of the lexicon and grammar are more
stable than others. A particularly stable feature of Ndu languages is numbers: a form na(k)
attested in Manambu and Gala n@/na- ‘one’ reconstructs to Proto-Ndu (see §10.6.1). So does
number ‘two’. Reﬂexes of Proto-Ndu ∗ v@t- ‘two’ are found in every Ndu language.
In all the Ndu languages, number ﬁve contains the root for ‘hand’, ∗ ta:ba, accompanied by
‘one’, e.g. Abelam nak-taba, Wosera na-tamba, Iatmul taba nak (Gerd Jendraschek, p.c.), and
Gala n@ wajan ‘one hand’. Manambu displays a slightly diﬀerent pattern: the form taba:b ‘ﬁve’
consists of taba- ‘hand+lk’ accompanied by the formative -a:b, which could be cognate to -ab
‘too’, or to -a:bab ‘all’. In the neighbouring Kwoma (Bowden 1997) numbers from ﬁve upwards
contain a body part followed by abo ‘all’ (the number ‘ﬁve’ yatii abo in Kwoma translates as ‘leg
all’). The structure of ‘ﬁve’ in Manambu is likely to have been inﬂuenced by Kwoma. This takes
us to areal diﬀusion patterns, and the question of the nature of similarities between Kwoma and
Manambu.22.2 di scerning t he effect s o f language contact: t h e

22.2.1 Linguistic diversity in the Sepik area of New Guinea
The extreme genetic diversity among the non-Austronesian languages in New Guinea, with
numerous families interspersed with isolates, remains a puzzle for comparative linguists. Languages of New Guinea have suﬀered—perhaps, more than any other area in the world—at the
hands of ‘lumpers’, with their attempts to put languages together into ‘stocks’, ‘macro-stocks’,
‘micro-phyla’, and ‘macro-phyla’ based on just a few lookalikes. Laycock and Z""graggen (1975)
postulated their ‘Sepik-Ramu phylum’ based on a number of typological similarities, and a few
dubious lexical similarities (including terms for ‘child’ and ‘pig’), for which ‘cognate’ sets were
not provided.
The Sepik River Basin (which includes East Sepik and Sandaun Provinces) is the most
complex linguistic area within New Guinea. It contains about 200 languages, an extreme59622 Genetic and Areal Relationshipslanguage density unparalleled anywhere else in the world. The Sepik River Basin displays
cultural as well as linguistic diversity and fragmentation, perhaps more so than any other area
of New Guinea. Reasons for this include geographic diversity, inaccessible terrains, patterns
of language contact, and language attitudes (see Foley 1986, 1988: 167–8; Aikhenvald 2004b;
Aikhenvald and Stebbins 2007), and also frequent migrations in search of further hunting and
ﬁshing grounds and sago ﬁelds (Paul Roscoe, p.c.). The average size of language communities
is signiﬁcantly lower than in the New Guinea Highlands.
Established families in the Sepik area include the Lower Sepik family, the Lower Ramu
family, the Ndu family, the Sepik Hill family, the Ram family, and the Tama family (Aikhenvald
and Stebbins 2007). An attempt has been made to establish genetic links between the latter
four families, and other languages of the Sepik area, such as Wogamusin, Chenapian, KwomaNukuma, Kwanga, and Abau (Foley 2000, 2005a), grouping them into a larger Sepik family.
Though some similarities (including some in pronouns) appear suggestive, there are hardly
any shared paradigms, or any regular correspondences. 1 Much more comparative analysis
is required, including low-level reconstructions for individual language families, before any
deﬁnitive conclusion can be reached.
A major problem with comparative linguistics in the New Guinea area is the misguided idea
that any linguistic similarity should be indicative of a genetic link. This is not the case.","[621, 622, 623]"
"13.6 Frustrative29313.6 f rus t rat i v e
Frustrative indicates that the action was done to no avail—that is, the desired result was not
achieved. Frustrative is an uninﬂected verb, but, unlike other uninﬂected verbs, frustrative
makes a distinction between durative and non-durative action. Durative frustrative is marked
with the suﬃx -p on the verb stem and repetition of the frustrative form. This indicates that the
action which failed to achieve the result took place over a lengthy period of time—as in 13.66.
The form can be repeated from two to ﬁve times, but hardly ever more than that. The more
times the form is repeated, the lengthier the failed attempt is supposed to be. The repeated
frustrative-marked verbs form one intonation unit, and no other constituent can intervene
between them.
A clause containing a frustrative form is typically accompanied by another clause indicating
either why the action failed, as in 13.66, or what was done after it failed, as in 13.67 and T3.31.

Like any uninﬂected verb, the durative frustrative can only occur in a dependent clause as a
copula complement of t@-, as in 13.67 and T3.29. Then there is only one copula no matter how
many times the durative frustrative form is repeated—this is an argument in favour of treating
the durative frustrative as one predicate, and not as repetition of several predicates:

The non-durative frustrative is marked with -yak@p. This form contains no indication as to
how long the frustrated attempt had lasted. The form is usually not repeated. We can recall,
from §2.4.2, that -yak@p is syllable-weight sensitive. If a verb root has a CV(C)V, a CVC, or a
CCV/CVC structure, the form of the marker is -yak@p, as in kwak@-yak@p (look.for-fr) ‘look
for in vain’, kayket@-yak@p ‘hold onto something in vain’, gra-yak@p ‘cry in vain’. If a verb
consists of a CV, the frustrative suﬃx undergoes initial CVCV reduplication, as in ya-yak@yak@p (come-red-fr) ‘come in vain’, v@-yak@-yak@p ‘look in vain; be unable to see’. The verb
v@- ‘see’ is unusual in that it has an alternative non-durative frustrative form v@-k@tak@p—this
is illustrated below. This alternative form ﬁts in with the iambic stress pattern characteristic of
weight-sensitive suﬃxes—see §2.4.2.

as in 13.71. Such haplology is unusual.

Like any uninﬂected verb, a frustrative -yak@p can only be used in a dependent clause as a
copula complement:

‘Having looked for me in vain, having packed my things, by entering (inside the bush)
they hid them together with their things’
The two frustrative markers may well be etymologically related: they share the formative -p.
We can hypothesize that -yak@- in -yak@p could be related to -yak@- ‘do fully’ (see §15.3.1), and
that -k@ta- in v@-k@tak@p could be linked to -k@ta- ‘try’, as in k@-k@ta ‘try eating’. However,
these hypotheses require further substantiation.
Unlike the other modal forms discussed so far, neither of the frustratives can be negated.13.7 no m i na l i zat i o n s m a r k e d w i t h dat i v e -av e r s i v e c a s e
We saw in §9.1.1 (under II) that deverbal nominalizations marked with the dative-aversive case
-Vk express a variety of modal meanings to do with future projection, unrealized wishes, weak
probability, or events to be prevented from happening. When used in the predicate slot, these
nominalizations behave like any uninﬂected verb; examples are at 13.73–5.

In 13.74, the ﬁrst occurrence of dative-aversive-marked nominalization expresses a wish. This
is a typical meaning of the dative-aversive case (see §7.4). The second occurrence of dativeaversive-marked nominalization is ambiguous: we recall, from §13.4.1, that these forms are13.7 Nominalizations with dative-aversive case295used in lieu of same-subject purposives with monosyllabic verbs. This is why the form kwakwak
(as in T3.40, third line, and 13.74) can be interpreted either as a dative-aversive nominalization,
meaning ‘might stay’, or as same-subject purposive, meaning ‘going to stay’. The ambiguity
can be resolved by the context, and under negation (see §14.3).

Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used as clausal complements in contexts which
would require the dative-aversive case on a noun phrase. These include verbs with a negative
meaning, e.g. ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6, ‘say no’, or ‘forbid, refuse’, as in 9.5 and 13.78 (cf. also
10.35), ‘forget’, as in 13.79, ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 9.9 and 13.80, and ‘be unwilling’ (lit. go for

something ominous and unpleasant—as in 13.84–5, and 9.8:

‘If one has a garden close (to the village), they might steal (vegetables from it)’
A dative-aversive nominalization on its own may have an apprehensive meaning, just like
dative-aversive case forms (see §7.4):
13.86 kiya-kiya-k
die-red-dat
‘(Do not go there) lest you die!’
The aversive use of dative-aversive-marked nominalizations in main clauses is another
instance of desubordination of verb forms which are predominantly used in dependent clauses.
In all the cases discussed above, dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations occupy the
second argument slot of a verb. They can also occupy the S slot of a non-verbal predicate
with a negative meaning, as shown in 13.87. This sentence states a convention concerning
men’s road and women’s road in Avatip. (A corresponding positive statement would require a
ø-marked nominalization: see §9.1.1.) A noun phrase marked with dative-aversive case cannot
be used this way. Examples like 13.87 oﬀer an argument in favour of considering fully reduplicated verbs marked with the suﬃx -k as separate modal forms which are homonymous, rather
than polysemous, with a dative-aversive (-Vk) case form of a deverbal action nominalization.","[319, 320, 321, 322, 323]"
"15
Verb Compounding
15.1 a n ov e rv i ew
Manambu has a wide variety of compound verbs which can consist of two or three roots. Their
meanings include cause-eﬀect, sequence of sub-events, and aktionsart. One or two components
can undergo full reduplication (see §12.8.2). Verb compounds form one grammatical and one
phonological word. Their components are strictly contiguous: no other element can intervene
between them.
The components cannot have separate value of tense, aspect, mood, action focus, modality,
or polarity. A compound is marked just once for each of the appropriate categories. All
compounds have fused argument structure: that is, they share all the core and peripheral
arguments. Two identical verbs cannot occur in one compound.
Compounds account for about 20 per cent of verbs in texts and conversations. The productivity of compounds varies, depending on their type. Components of a compound always
occur in a ﬁxed order. The only exception in the corpus is the pair taka-t@p- (put-close) ‘prevent
(from seeing), block’ and t@p@-taka- (close-put) ‘cover (the surface of something); prevent from
seeing’: these only partly overlap in their meanings (see §15.3 (A7 and A8) ).
All these properties are typical of one-word serial verb constructions, of a kind similar to
those found in other languages of the Sepik area (e.g. Yimas and Alamblak), and elsewhere
(e.g. Olutec in Central America and Dâw in Amazonia: a comprehensive typological account
is in Aikhenvald 2006a). What sets the Manambu verb compounds apart from canonical oneword serial verbs is their composition, and their semantics.
A number of components in verb compounds provide manner, aspect, and other speciﬁcations to the major component, but are not used in the language on their own (e.g. -jika‘do properly’, -maki- in gra- ‘cry’, gra-maki- (cry-do.a.lot) ‘cry a lot’). These nonce roots are
treated as verb roots rather than as derivational suﬃxes only for the sake of a uniﬁed analysis of
verb compounding structures. When more information on the lexicon of other Ndu languages
becomes available, we may be able to conﬁrm, or refute, our assumptions about their verbal
origins.
The semantic link between the independent verb and the same form in a compound is often
obscure. For instance, the verb yak@- means ‘throw’, and the compounded root -yak@- means
‘do fully’—the formal match is perfect, but the semantic link is not. The verb ya- means
‘come’. The form -ya- in compounds has two meanings. One, ‘coming; (do) while coming’,
is transparently related to the verb ‘come’, and the other, ‘carry on doing’, is not. We are faced
with the problem of diﬀerentiating polysemous stems from homonyms—a pervasive puzzle
throughout Manambu.
All these features are atypical for serial verbs (see an exhaustive account in Aikhenvald
2006a). The meanings of many compounds are idiomatic and do not follow any straightforward semantic rules. Even those compounds which can be considered productive display
restrictions on one or both components. Some verbs hardly ever occur in compounds. One
verb, ‘see’, has a suppletive form when it occurs as second component in compounding. This15.2 Symmetrical compounds339feature is reminiscent of ‘combining forms’ described in derivational morphology (Aikhenvald
2007), and is atypical of serial verbs. This is why I prefer to analyse Manambu verb sequences
as lexicalized compounds rather than as bona ﬁde serial verbs.
In terms of their composition, Manambu compounds divide into symmetrical and asymmetrical (cross-linguistically, this distinction is encountered in serial verbs, and other multiverb constructions: see Aikhenvald 2006a; Amha and Dimmendaal 2006).
(i) Symmetrical compounds consist of two components, from large open classes, whose
semantic relationship is that of sequence of sub-actions, manner, or cause-eﬀect. Each
has restrictions on the nature and/or the transitivity of one of the components. See §15.2.
(ii) Asymmetrical compounds consist of a verb from a largish open class (‘major’ verb)
followed by a root from a closed class (‘minor’ verb) which provides a meaning to do
with aspect, aktionsart, extent of action, and valency increase, as in k@-kus@- (eat-ﬁnish)
‘ﬁnish eating, eat up’, k@-k@ta- (eat-try) ‘try eating’. See §15.3.
An alternative structure, whereby a ‘minor’ verb from a closed class precedes the ‘major’
verb, is restricted to two ‘minor’ verbs—wa- ‘say’ and yi- ‘go’. Given the restrictions on these
constructions, we cannot exclude the option of their alternative analysis as preﬁxes.
Asymmetrical compounds whose second component is the verb -yi- ‘go’ or -ya- ‘come’ which
provides aspectual speciﬁcation do not occur in the imperative. To be used in a command, they
have to be rephrased with a biclausal structure.
Verb compounds may consist of a symmetrical compound within an asymmetrical one; or of
two asymmetrical compounds. They can never contain more than three verb roots. See §15.4.
The eﬀects of verb root reduplication in compounds are summarized in §15.5 (also see §12.8.2).
Some directionals can be analysed as a subtype of verb compounds—see §16.1.
Verb compounds diﬀer from complex predicates consisting of an uninﬂected form of the
major verb and an inﬂectable auxiliary. Unlike compounds, complex predicates form one
grammatical construction (with one tense, aspect, modality and polarity value), but consist
of two grammatical and phonological words—this is the topic of Chapter 17.15.2 s ymmetrical comp ounds
Symmetrical compounds belong to three broad types: sequencing (§15.2.1), manner (§15.2.2),
and cause-eﬀect (§15.2.3). Semantically non-compositional idiomatic compounds, including
those with nonce roots, are discussed in §15.2.4.","[364, 365, 366]"

(iii) one or two suﬃxal directional markers (see §16.1).
Scheme 11.1 The structure of a verb stem11.1.2 The structure of verbal predicate
All verbal markers occur on a verb stem. The structure of the verbal stem is in Scheme 11.1.
The verb stem must include (ii), that is, there has to be at least one verbal root (which
can undergo reduplication: see §12.8.3). Manambu has numerous types of verb compounding, covering sequences of subactions, valency changing, and aspectual meanings, such as
‘incomplete action’, ‘action to perfection’, and ‘completion’. The aspect markers which have
grammaticalized from compounded verbal roots can be reduplicated (see §15.2 for a discussion
of their meanings). This is unlike aspect markers discussed in Chapter 12.
Positions (i) and (iii) are optional. A verbal stem can also contain one, or maximally two,
directional markers, whose form varies somewhat depending on the verb (see §16.1).
We saw, in §3.1, that if a verb takes the action focus -na-, no constituent other than
the subject can be cross-referenced on it. The structure of a fully inﬂected verb with and
without the action focus marker is given in Scheme 11.2. Numbers of sections of Chapter
12 dealing with every speciﬁc category are in brackets. Verbal stem and subject (A/S) crossreferencing are the only obligatory components of a fully inﬂected verb—in the sense that a
verb form could not exist without them. Others can be added if a particular meaning is to be
expressed.
An example of a longish fully inﬂected verb is in 11.1. The verb stem here contains a
causative-manipulative preﬁx kay-, two compounded verb roots (see §15.3.2), and two directionals (§16.1.4). This is followed by the habitual, the future, the action focus marker, the nonA/S ‘basic’ cross-referencing marker, and the conﬁrmation marker. Numbers above example
11.1 correspond to the positions in the stem structure and the verb structure:
1. Verbal stem

"19.4 Purposive and desiderative clauses48319.4.2 Desiderative clauses
A desiderative form in a dependent clause always requires the same subject as that of the main
clause. Similarly to the same-subject purposive, desiderative is an uninﬂected verb. Desiderative
can express purpose, as in 12.62, 13.57–8, 19.47, 19.102, and T3.45. While the same-subject
purposive would have implied deﬁnite intention, the desiderative indicates a certain insecurity.
The desire expressed in 19.47 does not mean that the expedition will eventuate:
19.47 [kapayawi-k
yi-k@r] [war-na]
sweet.potato-dat go-des go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She has come up (into the house) wanting to go and get sweet potatoes’
We will see in §19.8 that desiderative clauses are used as complementation strategies with
verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ (in 19.102). Manambu has no verb meaning
‘want’. The idea of wanting something is most frequently expressed as a speech report (using
the verb wa- ‘say’) accompanied with a desiderative clause (this is also the case in many
other languages of New Guinea and Australia: see Aikhenvald 2008, for discussion and
references).
Unlike purposive clauses, desiderative clauses always have to be preposed to the main clause.
If they appear postposed, they typically form an independent clause juxtaposed to another
main clause. A short pause indicates a clause boundary in 19.48:
19.48 [mæy
yi-t@k]
[pause] [ka:m
k@-k@r] [v@-tua]
come.impv go-1duimpv pause breadfruit eat-des see-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
[ka:m
samasa:m ra:d]
breadfruit a.lot
sit+3masc.sgbas.vt
‘Come, let’s go, (I) want to eat breadfruit, I saw there is a lot of breadfruit’
Just like purposive clauses, desideratives can be used within dependent clauses, as in T3.45.
Neither purposives nor desideratives can head the predicate of a verbless clause. Desiderative
in dependent clauses cannot be negated—if they have to be, a desiderative clause has to be
rephrased as a main clause, which may be cast as a speech report.
A comparison of purposive and desiderative clauses is given in Table 19.3.
Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations can also be used to express purpose and have the
implications of same subject (see, for instance, T2.8: ‘to wash sago’). Their syntactic and
semantic properties are considered in §13.7. Similarly to purposive and desiderative clauses,

the basic meanings of the dative-aversive case—see §19.8.19.5 s p e e c h r e p o rt s
19.5.1 Speech report constructions and their properties
Speech reports are by far the most frequent clause type in Manambu discourse, and especially
in conversations. Even the small textual sample at the end of this grammar contains speech
reports in just about every third sentence.
Speech reports are extremely versatile: besides reporting actual speech events, they are
employed to express internal speech and thought, desire and intention of third person, reason
and purpose, and a few other related meanings. Multifunctional speech reports are a feature
Manambu shares with a number of Papuan languages: speech reports often express thinking,
desire, intention, and cognition. See Aikhenvald (2008) for an overview, and a summary of
typological parameters relevant for the analysis of speech reports.
Manambu has three verbs of speech—bla- (allomorph b@l-) ‘say/tell (something)’, yi- ‘say X,
speak (a language)’, and wa- ‘say, tell’. Of these, only the verb wa- occurs with speech reports
of any kind. The verb yi- occurs with just a few interjections as speech reports, as in ay yi-da-d
(interj say-3plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘they shouted’ (lit. they said ay) (T1.29). A comparison
of the three verbs of speech in terms of their further properties is in §21.1.3 (Table 21.1).
Speech reports in Manambu are multiclausal (Manambu has no reported evidentials).
Speech reports can be coextensive with a clause, or a sentence. They may be less than a clause,
containing just a vocative, as in 19.49, or an interjection, as in 19.50:
19.49 [gra-n] [ata wa-na]
[wun-a
ñan-eee]
cry-seq then say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt I-lk+fem.sg child-voc
‘She said crying: ‘Oh my chiiiild!’
ya:d]
19.50 [ [mm] wa-ku]
[ada
interj say-compl:ss dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+3masc.sgbas.p
‘Having said “mm” (an “up-to-no-good” interjection), he went oﬀ’
Or they may consist of several sentences, as in T2.40, and T3.22–5. Speech reports can be
discontinuous—as in T1.33. Discontinuity only occurs on clause boundaries.
Speech reports do not have any special segmental markers other than the verb of speech itself
in a framing clause. There is an optional pause between the speech report and the preceding
framing clause. Speech reports do not have the falling intonation contour of medial clauses, or
the rising contour of juxtaposed clauses.
Speech reports can precede or follow the framing clause containing the speech verb, with a
slight preference for the former. Clear examples of speech reports preceding the framing clause
are at T1.4, T1.11, T1.12, T1.16, T1.22, T1.24, T1.28, T2.5, T2.27, T3.8, T3.13, T3.16, T3.37,
T3.40–1, T3.44, T3.47, and T3.50. Clear examples of speech reports following the framing
clause are at T1.8, T1.13, T1.18, T1.19, T1.21, T1.23, T1.24, T1.26, T1.28, T2.40, T2.57, T2.58,
T3.22, and T3.41. If a speech report follows the framing clause, another framing clause is often
added at the end of the speech report. This is frequently cast as a medial clause—as in T1.33
and T2.7. This results in what looks like a speech framing construction: ‘they said [Speech
Report] having said’. A similar example is at 19.51. The speech report is in curly brackets, and
the framing verb of speech is underlined:19.5 Speech reports48519.51 [ada

A speech report can itself contain a speech report. Examples are at T1.33 (where the main
character is quoting what he himself had said prior to going oﬀ to ﬁght the moon), and T3.43.
We will now discuss further properties of speech reports in Manambu, including direct
speech reports (§19.5.2), reported commands as indirect speech reports (§19.5.3), and semidirect speech reports (§19.5.4). The syntactic role of speech reports is addressed at §19.5.5.
Polysemous patterns in speech reports are analysed in §19.5.6.","[509, 510, 511, 512]"
"20.1 Major constituents519The ﬁrst clause is an independent clause with a non-agreeing adjective in the predicate slot.
This is an example of a non-verbal clause. The second clause is a medial dependent clause
which contains a copula t@- and the same adjective in the copula complement slot. There is
no other way in which an adjective can appear in the predicate slot in a dependent clause (a
similar example is at T3.23). The third clause is a main clause, of the verbless type.

As expected, main declarative clauses distinguish more grammatical categories than dependent clauses. However, as we will see shortly, not all main clauses distinguish all categories.
Main declarative clauses divide into three types: verbal, non-verbal, and verbless. Verbal
clauses can be headed by a fully inﬂected, a partially inﬂected, or an uninﬂected verb (see
§11.1.1). The number of inﬂectional positions depends on the category—for instance, positive
indicative verbs are always fully inﬂected, while imperatives (see B below) are partially inﬂected,
and negative indicative verbs are uninﬂected (unless they are in the habitual aspect)—see
Table 11.1. Verbal clauses express the full set of tense, aspect, mood, and modality distinctions (detailed in Chapters 13–14), and can be headed by intransitive, transitive, ambitransitive, and ditransitive verbs—see §4.2.1. Or they can be headed by a copula—see under
B §4.2.2.
Copula clauses in Manambu contain polyfunctional verbs in their predicate slot. There
are ten such verbs, and they can each be used as copula verbs, as support verbs, and also as
auxiliaries. In addition, ﬁve of them are also used as lexical verbs. A summary of these verbs
and their functions is in Table 4.1.
When used as copula verbs, they head the predicate of copula clauses which involve
two arguments but cannot be considered transitive or intransitive (see Dixon 2002b for a
typological overview of copulas; also see §17.1).
The relationship between the two arguments of a copula clause—the copula subject and
the copula complement—covers identity, attribution, location, and possession. Their choice
depends on (a) the meaning of the copula construction, and (b) the semantic type of copula
complement.
We saw, both in Table 4.1 and examples 4.16–19, that copula clauses containing copulas t@‘be, stand’, r @- ‘sit’, and kwa- ‘stay’ are used to express location and existence (also see T1.32,
T2.67, and T3.43, for t@-; T2.4 and T2.7 for r @-; and T1.11 and T1.14 for kwa-). A similar
example is at 20.30.
The copula t@- —the most versatile in terms of its semantics—can also imply ‘coming into
existence’. The stative existential meaning and the more dynamic meaning of ‘appearing’ can
only be distinguished by context.
Consider 20.27. Its ﬁrst clause (which is a relative clause) contains the existential copula
r @- ‘sit (overtone of horizontal position)’. This copula never has any overtone of ‘coming into
existence’. It is used here because living or staying in an area is typically associated with a
horizontal location and treated as ‘sitting’. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs found in
some New Guinea languages—we saw, in §17.1.1, that despite some classiﬁcatory overtones,
positional verbs in Manambu cannot really be considered classiﬁcatory.
The second clause of 20.27 contains the copula t@- meaning ‘become, come into being’. This
same clause may also mean ‘a lake was (there)’, but this is not the reading implied by the
context of the story.","[545, 546]"
"4.5.1 Modal words
Modal words are a small closed class, which consists of two members, b@nak and n@b@ ‘be
able to, can’. Both form a complex predicate with an inﬂected verb in the indicative mood (see
§20.1.2). They are not inﬂected, cannot be negated, or questioned, or appear in a command;
neither do they appear in any of the modalities discussed in Chapter 13. Both have an epistemic
meaning of a potential. The form b@nak appears to be rarer than n@b@ and is always followed
by a verb inﬂected for person, number, and gender of the subject, as in 4.64. It occurs clauseinitially.
4.64 b@nak val
suku-k@-tua
capable canoe carve-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I can carve a canoe’
The form n@b@ does not have to occur clause-initially. It always precedes the inﬂected verb.
It can be accompanied by a verb inﬂected for third person singular feminine (basic set). Such1044 Word Classesa form can have a generic subject, as in pap@r n@b@ val (a.little.later.on able see+3fem.sgbas.vt)
‘one can see later’. The use of feminine cross-referencing here goes together with the functionally unmarked character of feminine in Manambu—see §5.2.3. Depending on the context, such
an expression can be understood as ‘we’, or ‘you’.
When Tanina said to me s@r n@b@ kwatiya-l (tomorrow able give.to.nonthird.p3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘one can give (this to me) tomorrow’, it was clear from the context that I was
the giver. Similarly, 5.27 refers to two people (‘us’) writing together. The referent of the subject
can be speciﬁed, by adding an NP, as in 4.65, or a personal pronoun, as in 4.66.
4.65 pap@r
Jag@r n@b@ val
little.later Jager able see+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘A little later Jager can see (what’s wrong with the machine)’
4.66 b@r
n@b@ wula-l
you.two able come.in-3fem.sgbas.vt
‘The two of you can come in’
This construction does not appear to be used with ﬁrst person singular subject. The second
alternative is to employ a verb form fully inﬂected for person, number, and gender. Then, there
are no restrictions as to the person of the subject—the ﬁrst person subject is shown in the ﬁrst
clause of 15.53.
In summary: the modal words form one complex predicate with an inﬂected verb (allowing
for two options of inﬂection). They cannot take any inﬂection themselves, or be used in any
other syntactic function, and can only occur in positive declarative clauses. (The negative
counterpart would be a copula clause with suan yi- (as in 4.7).) This makes them diﬀerent
from any other word class in the language.","[130, 131]"
"14.4 Negative imperative31714.4 ne gat i v e i m p e rat i v e
Manambu has several negative imperatives (or prohibitives) whose use correlates with person,
and with the strength of a prohibition. There is no ﬁrst person prohibitive—in other words,
there is no negative equivalent of ﬁrst person imperative (§13.2). The negative imperatives fall
into two broad classes: (i) non-ﬁrst person negative imperatives which can refer to second or
third person (§14.4.1) and (ii) speciﬁcally third person negative imperatives (§14.4.2). We discuss
these one at a time. Unlike negative non-future forms, the formation of negative imperatives
always involves simple (that is, positive) verb stem (§11.1.2).","[343, 344]"

Secondly, the third person recipient form is used for recipients in general, in the meaning of
‘giving away’, as in 4.32.
4.32 a-b@r
marasin kui-kwa-na-b@r
kui-ta:y

‘They used to give medicine (to people), giving (and giving)’
A third person recipient form is used in generic statements, even if these obviously include a
non-third person. Eight-year-old Tanina was worried about me not eating the banana I was
given, and giving everything away instead. She was sitting next to me, and I had oﬀered
the banana to her. That is, by using kui- in 4.33, she had subsumed herself (ﬁrst person)
under a generic set of recipients covered by this form. (Syntactically, this is an example of a
desubordinated cotemporaneous clause: see §19.9.) A similar example is in T2.1.
4.33 Sasa kur-ta:y
kui-ta:y

Sasha get-cotemp give.to.third.p-cotemp get-cotemp give.to.third.p-cotemp
‘Sasha (keeps) getting (things) (and) giving (them away), getting (things) (and) giving
(them away)’
Thirdly, the form kui- is the one that occurs in verb compounded structures whose meaning
is only partially predictable, e.g. kui-taka- (give.to.third.p-put-) ‘send, give away (e.g. money)’,
kui-tay-taya-n (give.to.third.p-to.side-to.side-seq) ‘give back and forth (e.g. in a situation of
exchange)’. This same form also occurs in idiomatic collocations, e.g. mawul n@ma kui- (inside
big+fem.sg give.to.third.p-) ‘be happy’, and s@p kui- (skin give.to.third.p-) ‘get used to’.
In spontaneous speech, many speakers employ kui- for a non-third person recipient, where
one would expect kwatiya-. Teketay is a very lively story teller and a gifted natural linguist. She
used kui- and kwatiya- for non-third person interchangeably, as shown in 4.34. The ‘aberrant’
use of kui- is underlined.

Later in the same story, she used kwatiya- for a ﬁrst person recipient (4.35), and then, a few
sentences later in the same story, she used kui-, for the same recipient (4.36):

‘We won’t give this child, to you’884 Word ClassesSimilar examples are not infrequent (see, e.g. 13.50). However, it is notable that the form
kwatiya- is hardly ever used instead of kui-. We can hypothesize that a tendency to replace the
restricted and functionally marked form kwatiya- ‘give to non-third person’ with a more widely
used and functionally unmarked form kui- ‘give to third person’ is indicative of the incipient
breakdown of the system, ultimately increasing the overall frequency of the functionally
unmarked kui- over kwatiya-, which is more restricted in the contexts in which it occurs.
Comparative evidence, from other languages of the Ndu family, does not fully support this.
The only other language in the family with a distinction between ‘give to third person’ and ‘give
to non-third person’ is the Abelam-Wosera dialect complex. 4 The Proto-Ndu form for ‘give’ is
∗
kwa(:)y/kw@y.
The two forms in Abelam-Wosera are: tiyaa ‘give to non-third person’ and kwayee ‘give to
third person’. The Manambu kui- (negative kwa:y) and the Abelam kwayé ‘give to third person’
are reﬂexes of the Proto-Ndu ‘give’, while the Manambu kwatiya- (negative and imperative
(-)kwata:y) can be interpreted as a combination of kwa(y) ‘give’ and the cognate of Abelam
tiyaa ‘give to non-third person’. That is, the Manambu ‘give to non-third person’ goes back
to a compound verb. The component -tiya in kwatiya- is likely to be an archaic cognate
between Manambu and Abelam-Wosera, lost from other Ndu languages. Sound correspondences between Manambu and Abelam-Wosera support this, making it unlikely for this form
to be a borrowing. (We saw in Chapter 1 that there is a certain amount of trade contact between
the Manambu and the Wosera people through barter markets; there is hardly any bilingualism,
or any substantial linguistic contact.) However, the compound itself can be interpreted as a
Manambu innovation. That some people still prefer to replace the new formation kwatiyawith the old form kui- may reﬂect the fact that this innovation is not yet fully established in
the language. An additional complicating factor in the ‘acceptance’ of this innovation is the
lack of support from neighbouring languages with which Manambu is, or has been, in trade
or other contact in recent times: neither Iatmul (also Ndu) nor Kwoma-Washkuk (which is
not demonstrably related to Ndu languages) distinguish the third–non-third recipient forms of
‘give’. Iatmul has one form kwi- ‘give’ (Staalsen and Staalsen 1973), which is a direct reﬂex of
Proto-Ndu ∗ kw@y, while Kwoma has a form ha (Bowden 1997).
The form kui- is unusual and perhaps archaic in one additional way. Unlike other verbs
in the language, it does not have to take the suﬃx -kwa- ‘habitual’ in the negative form. As
we will see in §12.3, the habitual aspect marked with -kwa- is likely to be the result of recent
grammaticalization of the verb kwa- ‘stay’. Two options are thus available for ‘give’ in past
habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not)
give habitually’, is shown in 4.37.

ak@s
kui-kwa-na-d
he-obl-dat money neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt

The non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s is shown in 4.38:

4 Laycock (1965: 166) did not register the distinction of the two forms for ‘give’ in Manambu. The Abelam-Wosera
tiya form is erroneously interpreted as ‘give to me’, while the form kway is said to be used with second person recipient.
This goes against all other sources for Abelam-Wosera (e.g. Kundama, Wilson, and Sapai 1987).","[113, 114, 115]"
"50419 Other Dependent Clauses19.9 de s u b o r d i nat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e s
What is an essentially dependent clause can come to be used as a main clause through regular
ellipsis of the erstwhile main clause. This phenomenon known as ‘desubordination’ has been
described for numerous languages, including English (see Stirling 1998). Desubordination and
the change of status of clauses can result in the creation of new tense-aspect-mood paradigms
(as in Australian languages: Dixon 2002a: 148–9), or evidentiality (as in Estonian: Aikhenvald
2004a: 281–3).
Just three of the medial dependent clause types in Manambu are used on their own (see
§18.2–4). In each case, this can be considered ellipsis; however, each use has its own semantic
overtones and can be analysed as a new clause type ‘in the making’.
Sequencing medial clauses with the verb marked with -n (§18.2) appear as strong commands,
as shown in 16.96, and 19.109—an annoyed order to a naughty child to be seated:
19.109 jupwi
taka-n
backside put.down-seq
‘Put your backside down!’ (lit. putting your backside down!)
A medial completive same-subject form on its own can also be used as a command, an
even stronger one. The illocutionary force is comparable to German participle commands, e.g.
hingesessen! ‘sitting here!’ An example is at 19.110—the mother was even more annoyed than
when she shouted 19.109:
19.110 t@k@r-@-m
da-ku
chair-lk-loc sit-compl:ss
‘Sit down on the chair immediately!’ (lit. Having sat on the chair!)
These command strategies ﬁll what can be conceived of as a ‘gap’ in the system. We saw
in §14.4.1 that Manambu has three prohibitive forms: a general prohibitive and two strong
prohibitives. But there is only one positive imperative (§13.2). The diﬀerent degrees of strength
of command corresponding to the degree of strength of prohibition are expressed through
command strategies employing desubordinated clauses. Rough correspondences, with numbers
of example sentences, are in Table 19.5.
A medial sequencing clause can be used as a complete sentence if it states the result of an
activity, as in 19.111. A pause of less than a second’s duration signals a sentence boundary.
There is no pause between the two sequential verb forms in the second sentence.

‘After he too had drunk water, then they two went. As a result they went and arrived in
the village’ (lit. going going out in the village)
Manambu does not have a morphological resultative derivation—desubordinated medial
sequencing clauses play the part of ‘resultative’ strategies.
Medial completive clauses, typically same-subject ones, can be used on their own, with a
completive meaning. A speaker came into the house and showed us a ﬁsh, commenting on
how she had obtained it:
19.112 [sa:n yapi-ku]
money buy/pay-compl.ss
‘I have paid money (for it)’ (lit. having paid money (for it)
This completive use is semantically close to the meaning of the anterior complex predicate
with the auxiliary t@- discussed at §17.1.1. Yet, it is diﬀerent inasmuch as the focus is on the
completion of the action and the result achieved.
Desubordination has its roots in ellipsis. Yet the two are diﬀerent. Consider 19.113b, an
answer to the question in 19.113a:
19.113a ak@
s@k@r væra-k-ñ@na
what.fem.sg time come.back-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt
‘What time will you come back?’
19.113b [na:gw yapi-ku]
sago buy-compl.ss
‘After I had bought sago’ (lit. having bought sago)
This has a clear overtone of sequencing and of relative tense: ‘I will come back after I’ve
bought sago’. Not so with 19.112 which simply focuses on the completion of an action. (An
additional way of focusing on the completion of one action before the start of another is
through using ya:kya ‘OK’ or its Tok Pisin equivalent orait in lieu of a main clause. We return
to this in §20.4.2.)
Along similar lines, a cotemporaneous clause can be used on its own, to express prolonged
action that started before the moment of speech and goes on and on. An example is at
19.114—a mother was exhausted by her baby daughter’s drinking and peeing non-stop. Similar
examples are at 4.33 and 18.35.
19.114 [gu
k@-ta:y]
[wus yi-ta:y]
water consume-cotemp pee go-cotemp
‘All she does is drink and pee’ (lit. having drunk water having peed)
Desubordinated cotemporaneous clauses typically occur in pairs, as in 19.114, 4.33, and
18.35, referring to continuous alternate or simultaneous actions. Since Manambu does not
have a dedicated verbal form to cover this meaning, once again a desubordinated verb can be
said to ﬁll in a gap.
Desubordination of the three dependent clause types discussed here goes hand in hand with
grammaticalizing the most frequent desubordinated forms into connectives. We saw in §18.3
that the form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a conjunction ‘thus, and so’ (18.28).","[530, 531, 532]"
