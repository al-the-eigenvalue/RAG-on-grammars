11.1.3.4Alternative interrogativesInterrogatives in Duna that do not contain an interrogative pro-form are commonly
structured as ‘alternative’ interrogatives which “provide a list from which, the speaker
suggests, the right answer might be drawn” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:179). Two
(or more) alternative scenarios are presented in the sentence. =Pe indicates there
is a choice to be made between these scenarios, and is felicitously represented in
English translation as ‘or’. Examples (1030) - (1032) show interrogatives in which
two alternatives of differing polarity are suggested. In (1030) - (1032) the positive
iteration of the predicate is placed first, inflected and further marked with =pe. The
negative iteration that follows is derived with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3),
and is not marked with =pe. This is typical of ‘alternative polarity’ interrogatives
in Duna (see also Giles MSa:L5). An appropriate answer (as shown in the b lines
of (1031) and (1032)) usually repeats part of the original question.",[445]
"7.3. Verb serialisation227clause. The serialised verbs prototypically have at least one argument in common,
and share tense, aspect and polarity values (Foley and Olson 1985; Givón 1990;
Durie 1997; Pawley and Lane 1998; Kratochvil 2007).
For Duna, I use the term ‘verb series’ (and related terms) to refer to sequences of
verb roots for which the final verb in the sequence (Vlast ) is inflected, bearing medial
or final verb morphology, and the other verbs in the sequence (Vn ) are uninflected.7
Regular Vn verbs are in bare root form, consonantal Vn verbs in their i-base form,
and wa-class Vn verbs may occur in either a-base or i-base form (§8.1.2).8 A basic
template for an SVC is represented in Figure 7.2. The ‘x’ designation is here used
to mean ‘number of subcategorised arguments’. That is, the template indicates that
the verbs together determine the argument structure of the clause, because the number of possible argument NPs matches the number of arguments that the complex
predicate (surrounded by angled brackets) specifies. The presence of the plus sign
indicates that the elements of the predicate are treated as comprising a single root,
for example in negation with the negative circumfix (§7.3.2.3).

the textual data (§7.3.2.1). There is continuity of at least one argument (usually the
subject) across serialised verbs, and in all examples noted in natural text, serialised
verbs are immediately contiguous (§7.3.2.2). Serialised verbs can be negated with
the negative circumfix as a single unit, and circumfixal negation of only one verb in
the series is strongly dispreferred (§7.3.2.3).

modality, and negation
8.1IntroductionThis chapter and the three that follow treat final predicate morphology in Duna,
looking in detail at certain bound morphemes that attach to the predicate element of
an independent clause.
This introductory section includes a general overview of final predicate morphology that is discussed in this thesis, with a particular focus on bound forms that
occur as inflections on verbal predicates. Section 8.1.2 lists the form variations of
the consonantal and wa-class verbs (introduced in §3.3.1) that are relevant to partially suppletive verbal inflection and stem formation.
The remainder of this chapter treats TAM markers that encode features of time
and event modality (§8.2), and indicators of negative polarity (§8.3).
8.1.1
8.1.1.1Overview of final predicate morphology
The basic morphological templateMy approach to the broad topic of final predicate morphology in Duna assumes the
general template shown in Figure 8.1.1 Two positions are specified, the primary
inflectional position (which is only relevant to verbal clauses), and the ancillary
position (which is relevant to both verbal and non-verbal clauses).
A primary inflection is an obligatory component of a final verbal predicate, and
establishes certain features of the predicated event in regard to its actualisation and
temporal status, for example, whether it is potential, completed, or ongoing. This
and the following chapter are concerned with morphemes that are used as primary
inflections.
1‘Adjv ’ refers to those adjectival roots that typically show distributional properties of verbs, and
can occur with TAM markers and the negative circumfix (§3.5). ‘Adjn ’ refers to those adjectival roots
that are more nominal in nature, and do not occur with TAM markers or the negative circumfix.","[295, 296]"

Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negation8.3. The negative circumfix8.3301The negative circumfixThe negative circumfix na- -ya (NEG - - NEG) expresses negation on verbal predicates. It is added to the a-base of consonantal verbs and the i-base of wa-class verbs.
Some uses of the negative circumfix were discussed in the previous chapter, which
describes how it is used differently in different kinds of complex predication. This
section describes this morpheme as it occurs both quasi-independently and in combination with some of the TAM markers described in §8.2.
8.3.1Quasi-independent useThe negative circumfix can occur as the only marker on a final verb. In such instances, I do not regard the circumfix as a true final primary inflection, but rather as
forming a derived stem that can function as the predicate of a final clause if there is
sufficient contextual support.34 The time reference of the predicate event is understood to be current with the ‘now’ of either the speech event or the narrated world.
Examples are shown in (721) and (722). See also §11.1.3.4 concerning the use of
negated verbs in alternative interrogatives.
(721)ho=pi-nainurindi-ta na-ra-ya.here=OPIN-SPEC 1/2PL land-LOC NEG-be/sit-NEG‘This one does not exist on our land.’ (T/HS:080305ia)
(722)antia-na-kana-si-ya.mother-SPEC-CS NEG-hold-NEG‘The mother didn’t have [any small change].’ (T/PK:080605ii)
8.3.2With other verbal inflectionThe negative circumfix also occurs in combination with TAM inflections, in which
case it is added before the inflectional suffix. A verb root plus na- -ya forms a
negative stem that takes the same inflections as a regular verb (regardless of whether
or not the base root is regular or otherwise).
Examples (723) to (726) show negative stems occurring with some of the final
TAM markers described in this chapter.

(724)no phuya na-na-ya-na.
1SG snakeNEG -eat- NEG - HAB‘I don’t eat snake.’ (ED/V:62)
34Verbs that are inflected with medial rather than final morphemes can sometimes be used in a
similar way. For example in conversation it can be acceptable to use a medial form such as hoa-ya
(come-DEP), ‘...coming...’, as a complete utterance, as long as more typically ‘finite’ values such as
time reference can be easily understood from context.","[328, 329, 330]"

(728)na-hoa-ya-wei.

See also (754), (761), (768), (783), (791), (796), (806), (826) and (836) in
Chapter 9 for examples of the negative circumfix occurring in combination with
evidential and information status markers.
8.3.3Negation with neyaAn alternative negating form to the negative circumfix is the lexical negator neya
(‘NOT’).35 The lexical negator is not a verbal inflection, and functions like a complementtaking predicate rather than a bound inflectional form. I include a brief description
of neya here because it is functionally related to the negative circumfix, and to aid
understanding of example sentences in which it occurs.36
Unlike the negative circumfix, neya can occur as a negator in non-verbal clauses
expressing equation or proper inclusion, and can occur independently as a complete utterance. As intimated by (Giles MSa:L5, L22), neya has features of a verbal
predicate, for example, it occurs in clause-final position and can take verbal inflections. It is unlike ordinary verbs in that it does not REQUIRE inflection and does not
subcategorise for NP arguments.
The sequence [nj3@] is also used as a negator. As it does not appear to differ from neya in
either meaning or distribution, and as there are obvious phonetic similarities, I assume that this is a
contracted form.
36
It seems likely that neya is also historically related to the negative circumfix. For example, one
possibility is that the lexical negator derives from an (unknown) verb negated with na- -ya, which
coalesced as a new word neya.
358.3. The negative circumfix303In a simple verbal clause negated with neya the final verb occurs in its root form
(regular verbs), imperfective stem form (consonantal verbs) or i-base form (wa-class
verbs). The verb ra- ‘be/sit’ occurs in its o-base form rao-.
Neya can occur clause-finally without any predicate morphology, as in (729) (731).

Alternative polarity interrogatives such as those shown in (1030) - (1032) are
functionally akin to ‘yes/no questions’ in that they ask, is something the case? However, the scenario of this something not being the case is made lexically explicit in
the utterance; these examples are thus similar to ‘disjunctive-negative’ structures
(König and Siemund 2007:297) that occur in languages such as Mandarin.
Examples (1033) - (1035) show some further alternative interrogatives. These
do not offer two alternatives of differing polarity, but detail possible propositions
that ‘sketch’ (either more or less exhaustively) the semantic domain of the required
information. Answers are shown in the ‘b’ lines.

Example (1036) shows an interrogative with more complex alternative propositions. The form =pe is repeated as a semi-independent form in between the alternatives, functioning like a coordinating conjunction. This repeated semi-independent
use of =pe is common if the alternatives are contrasted but not really ‘parallel’ propositions (that is, they differ according to several parameters, as in (1036)), or if
more than two alternatives are listed. See also (603) in §7.5.5.2.

11.1.3.5Question word interrogativesInterrogatives may alternatively be ‘question word’ interrogatives (Payne 1997) that
contain an interrogative pro-form (§3.9). The pro-form stands for information that is
missing from the speaker’s knowledge of the proposition, and which the addressee
is asked to supply (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:185). Some examples are shown in
(1037) - (1041). Interrogatives that contain pro-forms may be marked with =pe,
as in (1038) and (1039), or not, as in (1037), (1040), and (1041). I do not know
what factors motivate this alternation, but the presence of an interrogative pro-form
means the sentences are formally interrogative and inherently question-like in either
case.6

6König and Siemund (2007:300) note that, although the application of an interrogative particle
would seem to be superfluous in constituent (question-word) interrogatives, it was nevertheless the
case that in approximately half of the languages they sampled, interrogative particles could optionally be added to constituent interrogatives.","[445, 446, 447]"

7.3.2.3NegationIt is a feature of serialised verbs (as opposed to most other complex predicate constructions) that they are typically negated as a single constituent, the negative circumfix na- -ya (NEG–NEG, §8.3) surrounding the verb roots as in (488).9 Example
(489) shows a three-verb serialisation that is negated in this way. Example (490)
shows a negated purposive serialisation and (491) a negated ‘integrated activity’
serialisation. (See also §8.3.3 concerning an alternative negation strategy that can
be used with serialised verbs.)

As described in §8.2.4, there are some directive verbal inflections that have inbuilt negative meaning and express prohibition. According to Giles’ data it is also
possible to express prohibition using the negative stem and the imperative suffix, as
in (727), and similarly to express prohibitions on negative action using the negative
stem and prohibitive suffix, as in (728).

"7.4Verb adjuncts7.4.1IntroductionA verb adjunct construction (VAC) in Duna is a clause in which the predicate is
composed of a verb adjunct (§3.4) preceding a verb. The composition of a VAC
is represented in Figure 7.3. As in Figure 7.2, the ‘x’ symbol is used to mean
‘number of arguments’. Its placement here indicates that the argument structure of
the predicate is determined by the verb and verb adjunct in combination. The verb
adjunct and verb can be treated as a single root for the purposes of negation, or not,
as indicated by the fact that the plus sign in between the two is in brackets.

Figure 7.3 A verb adjunct constructionVerbs in Duna VACs are drawn from the consonantal and wa-class verb sets.15
The verb adjunct adds semantic content and may contribute to the argument structure of the clause, for example, forming a bivalent predicate with a monovalent
‘host’ verb (see for example §7.4.3.1). Typically the verb adjunct immediately precedes the host verb and the construction can be negated as a unit with the negative
circumfix na- -ya (§7.4.2.2). Most verb adjuncts occur with only one host verb, but
some may occur with several different verbs, contributing recognisably constant
semantics in each case (§7.4.2.3).

"1SG 2SG.CS suppress-SEQ leave-PROHIB‘Do not suppress and then abandon me.’ (T/SN:101203i)
The prohibitive suffix attaches to the o-base of consonantal verbs as shown
in (697) and (698).27 The semi-consonantal ra- ‘sit’ also uses the o-base for this
inflection, as shown in (699).
25Comrie (2003) discusses the fact that full or partial suppletion of a verb ‘give’ with respect to
the person of the recipient is quite a widespread phenomenon in the world’s languages, even in those
languages that (like Duna) do not generally show any object or indirect object agreement on verb.
26
König and Siemund (2007:308-311) note that the presence of a prohibitive marker, that is, a
morpheme that is specific to negative directives and occurs on sentences that are not otherwise
marked as negative, is a comparatively infrequent phenomena cross-linguistically. Out of their
sample of 70 languages only four had special prohibitive morphology of this kind.
27
There is probably a phonological basis for this: Several inflections outlined in this section are
marked on regular verbs by suffixes that are not consonant-intial but start with a labialised and/or
rounded glide or vowel, probably derived from the initial bilabial of the verb wa- ‘do’. These suffixes
attach to the o-base of consonantal verbs, or alternatively appear in the surface form to be directly
affixed to the base consonant. The exception to this is the suffix wayeni, see §8.2.4.4, for which the
base form varies.",[322]
"1.4Thesis overviewThis thesis describes certain structures of Duna grammar that are used in building
simple sentences, and looks in detail at some semantic themes that are encoded in
the bound morphemes of the language, particularly those that are to do with expressing attitudes to knowledge. It is an introduction to the language, and does not
present a comprehensive inventory of Duna grammatical morphemes and operations, or deal with complex sentence structures (for example, those involving clause
embedding or coordination).
Chapter 2 provides an overview of Duna phonology, including a description of
the phonemic inventory and the major allophones of these phonemes, and a preliminary statement concerning lexical tone in monomorphemic words. In Chapter 3, I
define Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, and list the known members
of small closed classes. Chapter 4 presents an overview of major clause types and
features of basic clause structure.
In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the structure of nouns, nominal phrases (NPs),
place phrases (PlcPs), and postpositional phrases (PP), constituents that typically
occur to represent participants in the clause. This includes an account of morpholo-1.4. Thesis overview27gically complex nouns and the lexical structure of NPs (Ch. 5), and itemisation and
illustration of bound morphemes that indicate the epistemic positioning, number,
definiteness, grammatical function, semantic role, and/or prominence of the phrase
to which they are added (Ch. 6).
In Chapters 7 to 11, I look in more detail at predicating constituents. Chapter
7 provides examples and discussion of certain complex predicate constructions, including complex verbs, serialised verbs, and predicates that are composed of a verb
in combination with a free lexeme such as a noun or adjective.
Chapter 8 begins my exploration of bound forms that occur on ‘final’ predicates.
Final predicates head an independent clause that constitutes a complete sentence
in itself, or occurs last in a chain of dependent clauses. Chapter 8 is concerned
with inflectional forms that occur on verbs, and indicate time, event modality, and
polarity features of the predicated activity, for example whether it is complete or
ongoing, or whether the speaker desires it to occur.
In Chapter 9 I describe two groups of bound forms (evidential and information
status markers) that a speaker can use as final verb inflections to supply an epistemic
assessment of the proposition that is encoded in the utterance, as well as to supply
temporal information. Evidential markers typically indicate a source of information
(for example, whether the predicated activity was seen to occur), and information
status markers encode other kinds of attitudes towards the proposition (for example
as knowledge that is new or familiar).
In Chapter 10, I illustrate complex final morphology constructions in which
evidential and information status markers are added following inflected verb forms
rather than bare roots, discuss the use of these forms in non-verbal clauses, and
introduce some further bound forms and constructions that are concerned in the
expression of epistemic assessment.
Chapter 11 examines final predicate markers as described in Chapters 8 to 10
with respect to the sentence types of Duna, focussing on the way that certain forms
make different predictions about the relationship of the speaker to the proposition
in interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sentences. In this last chapter I also
provide an overview of epistemic assessment and the final predicate in Duna.","[55, 56]"
"Chapter 7Some complex predicate structures
7.1IntroductionPredicates of verbal clauses in Duna often consist of a verb only, in the sense that
a single inflected verb root occurs clause-finally, and denotes ‘what’s going on’,
determining the argument structure of the clause and the semantic roles of the participants. Predicates of verbal clauses may also be complex, being “composed of
more than one grammatical morpheme (either morphemes or words) each of which
contributes part of the information ordinarily associated with a head” (Alsina et al.
1997).
This chapter identifies five major complex predication structures in Duna, summarised in Table 7.1.
Table 7.1 Complex predicate typesLabel
Complex verb:Composition
Verb-Modifier(s)-See:
§7.2Verb serialisation:(Verb-) Verb- Verb§7.3Verb adjunct (Va):Va Verb§7.4Adjunct nominal:N Verb§7.5.2Object-verb predication:NPobject Verb§7.5.3An individual complex predicate expression will map broadly to the one of
structures laid out in Table 7.1. However, many also show particular non-predictable
characteristics, relating for example to morphological composition, argument structure, or degree of lexicalisation. Some complex predications (particularly examples
of those structures that include a nominal) are idiomatic, comprising a conventialised expression the meaning of which cannot be predicted from knowledge of the
2187.1. Introduction219constiutents as they occur in isolation from each other (Nunberg et al. 1994:492).
In the first four sections of this chapter I proceed from complex predicates in
which the morphemic components are highly bound (for example, as a unitary stem
that cannot be separated) to those more idiomatic constructions in which the components are free lexemes or phrases that are semantically rather than formally interdependent.
Section 7.2 describes the derivation of complex verbs through the addition of
a directional demonstrative root, bound aspectual/adverbial form, or participantadding morpheme. Sections 7.3 - 7.5 define three major types of complex predicate
construction with reference to the word class of the constituent that occurs in addition to a clause-final verb.
In §7.3, I examine predicates that are composed of two or three verbs in series,
with an uninflected verb (or verbs) preceding an inflected verb. Typically verbs in
series must be contiguous, and the preferred method of negation with the negative
circumfix (§8.3) is ‘unitary’, that is, with the circumfix surrounding the whole series
as a single stem. Some verbs in series describe distinct activities; some are lexicalised to refer to a single activity that is not necessarily predictable from the meaning of the individual verb roots; and some occur in ‘asymmetrical’ constructions
(Aikhenvald 2006) in which the last verb in the series aspectually or directionally
modifies the preceding verb.
Section 7.4 concerns predicates that are composed of a verb in combination
with a ‘verb adjunct’ (§3.4). Both constituents can contribute to the meaning and
argument structure of the predicate. A verb adjunct typically immediately precedes
its host verb, and interposed constituents are generally dispreferred. The negative
circumfix can be applied either to the verb only, or to the verb adjunct + verb combination as a whole.
Complex predicates where a verb combines with a noun or NP are examined in
§7.5. The negative circumfix is not applied to the expression as a whole, but occurs
on the verb root only. The nominal element may be introduced into a clause in which
there is no argument slot for it to occupy (occurring as an ‘adjunct noun’), or occur
with a multivalent verb for which it can be posited as an object NP in what I term
an ‘object-verb predication’. Typically the nominal element is a non-referential and
unmodified common noun, and subject to an ordering restriction that it must follow
other NPs, PPs, or PlcPs in the clause, but some variation in regard to these features
is allowable.
Section 7.5 describes some further families of minor constructions that consist
of an NP or adjective in combination with the existential verb ka- ‘be/stand’. It also
discusses some special predicating structures that include existential verbs and are220Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structuresconcerned with the expression of possession and proper inclusion.
Section 7.6 looks at complex predicates that describe involuntary experience.
These represent a variety of construction types that are related but not identical
to some of those described in §7.3 - §7.5, and are grouped together on a largely
semantic basis.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"

Fronting may also mark contrast in which, broadly, one participant is ‘substituted’ for another (Vallduvı́ 1992:71-2).28 In (94), the object NPs of a negative and

In example sentences I use a hyphen (-) to represent ligature between two morphemes where
(at least one) of the morphemes does not occur as a freestanding form. I use the equals sign
(=) to represent ligature for: bound morphemes that attach to the final predicate, but do not
occur in a primary inflectional capacity (§8.1.1.1), that is, epistemic particles (§10.4) and
the sentence-final markers =nia ASSERT and =pe ‘Q’ (§11.1); and dependent third person
pronouns (§6.6.3). I do not use ‘-’ versus ‘=’ to represent an overall distinction between
affixes and a clitics. A large number of the bound forms that I describe in this thesis are
arguably clitics on the basis of their distributional flexibility. However, a more developed
understanding of Duna phonology is necessary to explore the validity and applicability of
a clear clitic/affix distinction, and I use ‘=’ for morphemes which are anomalous in other
ways.
Where a single Duna morpheme requires glossing with more than one English word,
these are separated by a full stop. In certain cases where a given morpheme encodes more
than one category or meaning I use a forward slash (/) to separate these two meanings.
Words in example sentences that are clearly related to Tok Pisin and/or English words
are annotated ‘lw’ (for ‘loan word’) in the gloss. Some of the examples in this thesis include Duna words that belong to a “special esoteric vocabulary” (Haley 2002:132) called
kẽyaka. Kẽyaka terms are used extensively in song, but are not typically used in everyday
conversation or spoken narratives. Kẽyaka terms are indicated in example sentence glosses
with ‘k.’ preceding the approximate import of the word.
In Chapters 9 to 11 approximations of perception events that are entailed by evidential
markers (§9.2) are shown in curly brackets in the English translation.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"
"2968.2.4.4Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negationWarning againstOn regular verbs, the form wayeni (WARN) occurs following the root to express
a warning against the predicate activity, intimating that there will be bad consequences if the event occurs. As pointed out by Giles (MSa:L4), this functions
like a negative command for non-immediate actions (see §8.2.4.6). Two examples
are shown in (709) and (710).

(710)ha-naanguruka-wayeni.there-SPEC RESTRICT dig.out-WARN‘That one only, you must not dig out.’ (T/JK:KG05V5.27)
For consonantal verbs, there is variation as to whether: -yeni follows the abase, as in (711) and (712b); -wayeni occurs following the imperfective stem, as in
(712a); or -wayeni is added to the o-base, as in (712c). In some cases wayeni is
reduced to [waj ni] or [waE ni]. Further data and analysis are needed to determine the
contrastive structural relationships, semantics, and/or functions of these possibilities.

With wa-class verbs -yeni can be added to the a-base or wayeni can be added to
the i-base, as in (713).

(T/RS:270405b)8.2. Tense, aspect and event modality (TAM)297The WARN marker can also used as a more polite alternative to the prohibitive
inflection.
Wayeni can be used to mark a sentence in a (paratactically) coordinate structure
that expresses negative purpose.31 The activity described by the one sentence is
performed so that the situation described by the wayeni sentence does not arise, as
in (714) - (716). In such cases the subject of the wayeni clause may be third person.

8.2.4.5Suggestions with koneThe form kone occurs on final predications following verbs that are marked with the
intentive or hortative inflections. This construction (V-INT / HORT + KONE) marks
utterances that suggest what can, should, or may be done.32 The intentive is used
with inclusive or addressee subjects, and the hortative with third person subjects.
The morpheme kone is as yet poorly understood (for example, its precise distribution is not known), and it seems to be a lone player rather than belonging to a set
of contrastive forms. This construction is included here on functional grounds even
though it is not strictly inflectional. Some examples are shown in (717)-(719).
(717)inusopa Tomas kei-ta1/2PL below PSNMamsa-nda nga-nda kone.be/stand.STAT-LOC GPN-3ENCL go-INTKONE‘We should go to where Tomas lives at Banz.’ (T/KP:120205i)

(719)itane kota ngoae kone.

31This was brought to my attention by Giles (MSa:L30)
I have used ‘should’ in translating all of the examples here for the sake of consistency but as far
as I know ‘can’, ‘could’, ‘shall’, ‘may’ etc would be equally appropriate.
32298Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negationGiles (MSa) observes that kone also occurs with -nda and -wae in purpose
clauses. An example is shown in (720). I found only a few occurrences of this
structure in the 2003-7 data (one example can be seen in (362)).

8.2.4.6A paradigm of immediate and deferred directivesGiles (MSa:L4) describes the desiderative inflection (§8.2.2.4) and TAM markers
presented in §8.2.4.1 - 8.2.4.5 in terms of whether they are ‘immediate’ or ‘deferred’
command forms. It is worth pointing out that there is a functional paradigm in
this respect, as represented in Table 8.13 (showing regular inflections only). The
table illustrates the way that formally diverse morphemes and constructions can
be arranged in opposition to each other with respect to a semantic or functional
variable. This is a fairly pervasive feature of Duna, as there are few systematically
contrastive inflections or morphemes that comprise discrete formal paradigms.

-nda koneAs noted by Loughnane and San Roque (forthcoming), the existence of a (typically constructionally diverse but semantically coherent) system of immediate versus
deferred directives is well-attested in languages of the wider region. See: Franklin
(1971:39) on Kewa; Lang (1973:xxxvi) on Enga; May and Loeweke (1980:72) on
Fasu; Madden (MS:16) on Angal (Mendi); Rule (1977:55-8) on Huli, Foe, and Pole;
and Schieffelin (1986:567) on Kaluli.33 Pairs of immediate (‘strong’) and deferred
(‘weak’) command forms are found in Nambikuara (Mamainde), Brazil (Kroeker
2001:30-2), a language which is discussed in §9.2.2.2 in regard to its evidential system. See also Shapiro (1989:88-90) concerning the deferred imperative in Hindi and
Bybee (1985:17-3) concerning languages with inflectional ‘delayed’ imperatives.
33Interestingly this feature appears to coincide with evidential verbal morphology, and in at least
one case (Fasu) is analysed by the describers as representing an ‘in sight’ versus ‘out of sight’
distinction (May and Loeweke 1980:72). Time appears to be a more important feature than visibility
in the Duna case, but this issue warrants further investigation.","[324, 325, 326, 327]"
"11.1. Overview of sentence types415sentences that are marked with the uncertainty maker -rape (§9.3.3.2), or the epistemic particles =koae and =nokoae (§10.4.3). In these cases the marker =pe also
occurs, but is not really productively applied, as in the case of -rape it is represented
as a frozen component of the morpheme, and in the case of (no)koae is basically a
required element of independent use of these forms (unless an interrogative word
is present in the sentence). Speculative sentences are like interrogative sentences
in that the speaker expresses ignorance of the proposition, and encourages the addressee to have a look at what they know about it. However, unlike typical contexts
of interrogative sentences there is little expectation that the addressee knows the
answer and will be able to respond definitively.
11.1.3.2Question marker =peThe question marker =pe follows a final predicate in an utterance that is nonassertive and typically elicits information from an addressee, that is, has a question
function. The question marker may occur on verbal clauses as in (1023), and on
non-verbal clauses as in (1024). These are examples of a question word interrogative and a yes-no interrogative, respectively.
(1023) Kipu pa-na
PSNngo=pe.query-SPEC go.PFV=Q‘Where has Kipu gone?’ (ED/VIII:134)
(1024) ko-ya=pe.
2Sg-BEN=Q‘Is [that] yours?’ (LC/III:60)
The assertion marker =nia (§11.1.2.1) and question marker do not co-occur, as
shown by (1025).
(1025) * ko na-nda=nia=pe
2SG eat-INT=ASSERT=Q* Will you eat? (CD/XIV:21)
The question marker may also occur as a phonologically free form, see (1036),
and can constitute an entire utterance. In the latter case, the interrogative marker
refers back to what has just been said, typically expressing the speaker’s interest in
and/or wonder at what the addressee is telling them.5
König and Siemund (2007:294-5) comment that, where interrogative sentences
are derived from the application of an interrogative particle or clitic to a declarative
sentence, this marker is typically positioned sentence finally (especially in verb-final
5I observed this ‘feedback interrogative’ in conversation, but unfortunately have not found any
occurrence of it in the transcribed data so am unable to provide a suitable example.","[443, 444]"
"74Chapter 3. Word classesnot modified by postposed constituents such as quantifiers and demonstratives, and
unlike both common nouns and proper names they do not occur as nominal specifiers. Personal pronouns (excluding special contrasted subject (CS) forms, see
Table 3.3) can be doubled to emphasise the solitary nature of a participant (§5.4.2.3).
They may also be marked with the ‘exclusive identity’ marker -nga (§6.6.2). This
morpheme does not occur on other nominals (although it is applicable to locational
demonstrative roots, see §6.4.4.1).
The ‘unmarked’ set of personal pronouns (that is, as opposed to CS forms) distinguishes first (1), second (2), and third (3) person and singular (SG), dual (DL),
and plural (PL) number as shown in Table 3.2. Within the plural pronouns, there
is a conflation of the first and second person reference forms. Third person pronouns can be encliticised to NPs, and are typically only used in denoting subject
arguments and possessors (§5.3.1.1, §6.6.3).

khena(-ka)VerbsWords that are members of a ‘verb’ class typically express actions, processes, and
states (Schachter and Shopen 2007:9; Evans 2000:712). A Duna verb typically
functions as the head of a clausal predicate, in which case the verb root must be
inflected (either medially or finally). The ordering of bound verbal morphology is
represented in Figure 3.1. Derivational affixes and directional demonstrative roots3.3. Verbs75occur in the ‘modifier’ position following the verb root (§7.2). The negative circumfix (§8.3) is applied to the (modified) stem, deriving a negative stem that can be
used as a medial or final verb or have inflectional morphology added to it (that is,
once the negative circumfix has been applied to a verb, further inflectional marking is possible but not strictly obligatory). With respect to final verbs, ‘inflectional
morphology’ includes tense, aspect, and event modality markers (§8.2), evidential
markers (§9.2), and information status markers (§9.3). Duna also has a range of
medial inflectional morphemes (not described in this thesis) that typically indicate a
time or aspect value with respect the following clause (for example if the predicated
activity is completed before the activity predicated in the following clause begins)
as well as signaling features concerning ‘cohesion’ (for example, if the identity of
the controlling argument changes from one clause to the next). In complex predications up to three verb roots can occur in series, with only the last verb of the series
bearing inflectional morphology (§7.3).
—————————————————————————————
NEG - Verb root - Modifier - NEG - Inflectional morphology
—————————————————————————————
Figure 3.1 Ordering of verbal morphologyPredicating verbs determine the argument structure of a clause (although see
also Chapter 7 concerning complex predication). I describe verbal roots in Duna
as monovalent (taking one argument), bivalent (taking two arguments) or trivalent
(taking three arguments). Monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent clause types are described and exemplified in §4.1. Some verbal roots can take either one argument or
two arguments and I refer to these as ambivalent verbs (§4.2.3.4).
There are three (partly cross-cutting) closed verb classes within the class of
verbs. Two of these are defined on the basis of shared morphological and distributional characteristics. The third group, existential verbs, is defined through a
combination of formal and functional features.
3.3.1Morphologically distinct verb classesThere are two groups of Duna verbs that have distinct morphological and functional
properties. I refer to these as the ‘consonantal verbs’ and the ‘wa-class verbs’.6
Consonantal and wa-class verbs are high frequency7 and have quite general lexical
meaning. They are the only verbs that occur in combination with verb adjuncts
(§7.4). These two groups are listed here and described in more detail in Chapter
6Giles (MSa) identifies these two verb groups and refers to them as the irregular verbs and waclass verbs, respectively.
7
For example, a count of verbs in a short text (excluding immediately adjacent repetitions)
showed that of 60 tokens, 40 were either consonantal or wa-class verbs.","[102, 103, 104]"
"1SG.CS first finish be/put.PFV‘First I finished [it].’
b. * naitaala ro1SG.CS finish first be/put.PFV* First I finished it (CD/XIV:76)
However, the pre-verbal modifier ha ‘already, quickly’ was generally judged
acceptable preceding either the verb adjunct or the host verbs as illustrated in (520)
and (521). This contrasts with verb serialisation, in which ha should precede the
first predicating element.

Some complex predicate structures7.4.2.2NegationVerb adjunct constructions can be negated by applying the negative circumfix naya to the verb adjunct + verb as a single constituent, as in (522) and (523b), or
applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as in (523a) (see also (531)).

Compare this with (726), in which the hortative inflection follows the negative.
The applicative form -iwa ‘BNF’ is used to indicate that the predicate
activity is carried out to help another person. It introduces an additional beneficiary
and/or possessor participant (typically encoded as an NP-internal possessor or a PP
marked with -ya BEN, §6.5.4). Examples are shown in (478) - (480).

"The way these features typically play out with respect to sentence types is shown
in Table 11.1.
Excepting interrogatives, Duna sentence types are here defined largely in terms
of the final inflectional or ancillary marker that occurs on the final predicate. The
presence of a certain morpheme in this position is regarded as a function/determinant
of the kind of sentence that it is. The correspondence between predicate morphology and sentence type is summarised in Table 11.2.
11.1.2DeclarativeSadock and Zwicky describe declarative sentences as being “subject to judgments
of truth and falsehood” and outline the general function of this sentence type as11.1. Overview of sentence types411Table 11.1 Typical features of sentence typesType

so on” (1985:160). The declarative sentence type is most typically associated with
utterances that are statements, having propositional content that the speaker communicates to the addressee.
As shown in Table 11.2, final predicate markers that I define as occurring in
declarative sentences1 include: TAM markers as described in §8.2.2.1 to 8.2.2.3,
§8.2.3 and §8.3; evidential markers (§9.2); the individual standpoint marker -pa;
specificity marker -na; and the epistemic particles =pi and =pakapi. Most of the
examples shown in the sections that introduce the relevant morphemes are declarative sentences. Sentences headed by non-verbal predicates (either unmarked or
marked with one of the morphemes listed) are also declaratives.
It is a core property of Duna declarative sentences that they can be derived as
interrogatives, for example, through the addition of the interrogative marker =pe;
sentences which typically function to communicate substantive content can be transformed into sentences that seek (part of) the same content from somebody else.
A further typical (but not universal) property of predicate morphemes that occur
in declarative sentences is that in situations of emphasis they are compatible with
either the SPEC marker -na (§10.2.2, §10.2.4) or the assertion marker =nia. This is
true of all of the relevant TAM markers, the personal evidential markers, and the
relevant epistemic particles.2
11.1.2.1Assertion marker =niaThe bound form =nia (ASSERT) occurs finally on declarative sentences and marks
an utterance as an assertion.
Examples (1016) and (1017) show the assertion marker occurring on non-verbal
predicates.
(1016)no ima=nia.
1SG woman=ASSERT‘I am a woman.’ (T/YS:270205)
1Note that with regard to complex predicate morphology, it is the last morpheme in the sequence
that is relevant to this definition.
2
In the case of the individual standpoint marker -pa the situation in regard to this feature is not
clear (§10.2.4.4). Concerning the quasi-inflectional occurrence of the SPEC marker on independent
verbal clauses (§9.3.2.2), such verb forms are not further marked with =nia, and the question of
whether they are ‘compatible with SPEC’ is problematic; this would amount to asking if a morpheme
can be applied twice, something which has not been observed as allowable in any other area of the
grammar. Finally, the impersonal evidentials: these forms have something of a semantic/functional
incompatibility with either -na or =nia. The SPEC marker implies that the predicate refers to a highly
specific and individuated occasion, which clashes somewhat with the generalised and unanchored
perception denoted by the personal evidentials. Similarly, the assertion marker =nia basically marks
the speaker as an epistemic authority, and this is also at odds with the non-specific perceiver evoked
by the impersonal markers.","[439, 440, 441]"
"Chapter 4Basic clause structure
4.1Clause typesI define four basic clause types in Duna with reference to the word class and valency
of the predicate. Section 4.1.1 describes non-verbal clauses, that is, those that are
headed by a non-verb (for example, a nominal or adjective) and are not marked
with inflectional TAM or polarity morphology (Chapter 8). Non-verbal clauses
typically describe timeless relationships of equation and attribution rather than temporally specified events or states. Sections 4.1.2 - 4.1.4 describe verbal clauses,
which are headed by an inflected verb. Verbal clauses can be monovalent (§4.1.2),
bivalent (§4.1.3), or trivalent (§4.1.4). Some adjectival roots can also head monovalent verbal clauses (§4.1.2.4).
4.1.1
4.1.1.1Non-verbal clauses
Nominal predicatesA relationship of (a degree of) identity between two things can be by expressed
through the juxtaposition of two nominal phrases, the second being the predicate.
These clauses express two kinds of identity relationship (as per Payne (1997)): those
of ‘equation’, where the two phrases refer to one and the same entity, as in (22); and
those of ‘proper inclusion’, where one of the phrases describes a feature or attribute
of the other, referencing a ‘set’ to which it belongs, as in (23).1

1SG ground PLN‘My homeland is Paka.’ (T/JK:KG05V5.27)
(23) kho iwani Mbara ima.
3SG wifeGPNwoman‘His wife was a Mbara woman.’ (T/HY:201003iii)
1Full stops and commas in the Duna lines of examples are intended to give some indication of
(actual or usual) intonation units. Commas indicate anticipatory intonation (typically rising) and full
stops indicate closing intonation (typically falling).","[124, 125]"
"INTENS one take. PFV‘One time before I got a very serious illness.’ (T/HS:180605i)
As for nominal elements in object-verb predications, there is some evidence that
in some expressions the ailment noun (or NP) occupies the P participant slot that is
subcategorised for by the bivalent verb that it occurs with, and is an object NP.
Firstly, it can be seen that although one can view the ailment as affecting the
experiencer, it is not the subject of the bivalent verb in the construction. Examples
(614) and (615) show different uses of the noun malaria. In (614), malaria heads a
subject NP in an ordinary bivalent clause headed by the verb kole- ‘break, split’. The
NP is marked as a contrasted subject with the morpheme -ka. Example (615a) shows
the noun malaria occurring with the verb sa- ‘take, get’ as part of an ailment+verb
predication. It is not the subject of the clause and cannot be CS-marked, as shown
in (615b).
(614)Koro nane ndu-na, malaria-ka kole khi-tia-na.

1SG malaria take-DEP‘I have malaria’
b. * no malaria-ka sa-ya
1SG malaria-CS take-DEP* I have malaria (CD)
Examples (616) and (617) illustrate that a clause headed by the phrase papu
na- has structural features of an ordinary bivalent clause, with the experiencer being realised as a subject NP, and the ailment being realised as an object NP. It is262Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structurespossible for the NP that references the experiencer of the ailment to be CS-marked,
identifying it as the subject of the clause (616) . Example (617) shows that for this
phrase flexibility of word order is allowable, as in typical bivalent clauses.

(617)papukone, Keni-ka neya-na.anguish INTENS PSN-CS eat.IPFV-SPEC‘True anguish, Kenny is suffering [it].’ (ED/XV:60)
Ailment + verb constructions usually undergo verb-only rather than unitary negation with the negative circumfix, as shown in (618). This is characteristic of other
noun + verb constructions.

7.6.2Other involuntary experience predicates7.6.2.1Involuntary perception expressionsI have recorded four forms that are typically used in combination with the verb ke‘see’ to describe certain involuntary experiences. I refer to predicates that include
these forms, shown in Table 7.13, as involuntary perception expressions.

"9.2. Evidential markers337evidential category.33
The kinds of evidential systems outlined above thus suggest a particular question concerning the Duna perfective inflection, namely, whether it is a semantically complex form that specifies both time and information source, and represents
a participatory and/or factual evidential category.34 If it were, this would allow an
analysis that evidentiality is an obligatorily marked category within a certain area of
Duna grammar (declarative sentences that denote past time events). However, while
it seems very likely that the perfective inflection at least implies participatory/factual
semantics as a consequence of contrast with other possible primary inflections, at
this stage there is insufficient evidence to claim that it actively encodes information
source and is itself an evidential marker.
In languages in which participatory and/or factual evidential markers occur, they
are members of a closed set of mutually exclusive morphemes that have information
source as a primary meaning. That is, there are compelling categorical reasons, as
well as semantic and functional motivations, to treat the markers in question as
evidential.
This is not so in the Duna case, as there are clear indications that while the perfective inflection contrasts with each evidential marker, it is not part of the same
formal set. As has already been mentioned, the perfective inflection has much more
restricted distribution than evidential markers, as it only occurs as a primary inflection on verbal predicates, whereas evidentials can occur as ancillary markers
with verbs (§10.2.3), and most can mark nominal predicates (§10.3). The evidential
markers as identified in §9.2 comprise a mutually exclusive set of forms that cannot
co-occur; however, many of them are attested occurring in combination with the perfective inflection (§10.2.2.5). Verbs that are inflected as perfective are commonly
further marked with epistemic particles (§10.4), whereas verbs that are inflected
with evidential markers typically are not, and in some cases are barred from doing
so (§10.4.2). A further significant point concerns the application of the assertion
33In the Oksapmin case, as described by Loughnane (2007), the participatory/factual evidential
is zero-marked in some person/aspect categories, and is also the inflection that can be most widely
used in more complex morphological structures. For example, a preverbal particle that encodes
inference can be used with a verb that bears a participatory/factual inflection, in which case the
information source meaning of this inflection is bleached. Thus, the participatory/factual forms are
the functionally unmarked way of expressing past tense in the grammar. Nevertheless, as argued by
Loughnane (2007), in view of the paradigmatic formal opposition displayed and contexts in which
the independent inflection is appropriate, the most sensible interpretation is that verbal markers
comprise a distinct evidential category—the participatory/factual—in these languages.
34
One alternative analysis would be to posit a ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential marker. However this would not add anything to the present discussion, which is concerned with markers that can
occur as primary inflections. Such a morpheme would have to be defined as a marker that can only
occur in an ancillary capacity (Chapter 10), as it is not the case that a verb can occur as a final predicate in (apparent) bare root form, inflected with the postulated ‘zero’ participatory/factual evidential
only.","[365, 366]"
"11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity425role is similar to the ‘epistemic authority’ or ‘epistemic source’ as defined by Hargreaves (1991 2005) concerning Newar(i). In regard to Duna I use the term informant to refer to the speaker of a declarative sentence and addressee of an interrogative
sentence. That is, I use it as a label which is defined through reference to sentence
type, rather than through reference to what a speaker supposes or claims about participants in the speech act situation. This supports discussion of knowledge-related
features that are typically vested in the informant person, but can be manipulated to
semantic or pragmatic effect (see, for example, §11.2.2.5).
11.2.1.2Relevance to DunaAs mentioned previously, standard implications concerning subject identity that are
generated by predicate markers in Duna typically follow a conjunct/disjunct pattern.14 In particular, these implications show an alternation in declaratives and interrogatives as to whether the speaker or addressee is targeted as the most or least likely
candidate for the subject slot, and are sensitive to whether or not a subject is volitional. Evidential markers (§9.2) and the prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) align with
the disjunct category. The intentive (§8.2.2.3) and promissive inflections (§8.2.3.5)
align with the conjunct category. Other declarative inflections are (as far as the
current data indicate) basically neutral forms.15
The conjunct/disjunct distribution of forms is not strongly grammaticised as
subject agreement in Duna: it is not true to say that the morphemes under discussion encode informant (and non-informant) as person categories, and index the
coidentity of instantiations of these categories and clausal arguments. Rather, this
distinctive distribution is largely a consequence of the individual semantics of the
morphemes, the way an informant is typically linked to the perceiver entailed by
certain morphemes, and logical and/or conventionalised expectations of how people
experience events. This is discussed as relevant throughout the following sections.
14As regards the evidential markers (§11.2.2), certain morphemes tend not to be used with predicates that have informant P arguments. For example, it would sound strange under normal circumstances for someone to describe something that had been done to them using the notional evidential
category. We can generally regard deployment of Duna results and notional evidential markers with
predicates that have an informant as one of the core arguments as unexpected, and potentially unacceptable on logical grounds. Nevertheless, P argument identity does not impose any such restrictions
on the use of the visual or sensory evidential markers in the way that subject identity does, and cannot be regarded as a clear predictive factor in predicate morphology except in a negative sense for
a small number of morphemes, and in a correlative sense as a function of subject identity implications. With respect to alternation between the intentive and prophetic inflections (§11.2.3), and the
applicability of certain deontic modality inflections (§11.2.4) the identity of the P argument has no
direct bearing on what forms are used.
15
However, the fact that verbs with informant subjects draw their inflections from a smaller pool of
morphemes, coupled with the semantic contrasts expressed in the inflectional system, also means that
there is a markedly increased likelihood for certain morphemes to occur in clauses with informant
subjects. This is a tendency rather than a clearly predictive relationship, but is nevertheless notable.","[453, 454]"

"11.1Overview of sentence types11.1.1IntroductionSadock and Zwicky (1985:155) define the term ‘sentence type’ as referring to “a
coincidence of grammatical structure and conventional conversational use”. Definitions of sentence types are based on a correlation between typical functions (for
example asking a question or making an assertion) and the contrasting structures
of utterances that achieve (or are intended to achieve) these functions. König and
Siemund (2007:277) remind us that the illocutionary force (function) of a particular utterance is something that is negotiated between speech act participants in a
409410Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typeparticular context, and cannot be precisely determined through reference to formal
properties only. However, structures that index sentence type do provide one kind of
signal of what the speaker wants the addressee to ‘do’ with the proposition encoded
in the utterance (cf. Weber 1986), for example, understand it as information that the
speaker has and is communicating to them (a statement), assess the proposition in
terms of his or her own knowledge and respond accordingly (a question), or bring
the denoted situation about (a directive).
I define Duna sentences as being one of six types: declarative (§11.1.2), interrogative, speculative, imperative, optative, or assumptive. Interrogatives are grouped
with speculatives (§11.1.3) and imperatives are grouped with optatives (§11.1.4), as
these sentence types have some formal and functional similarities and it is useful to
be able to discuss them together. The positive identification of assumptive sentences
as a unitary discrete type is somewhat problematic, and this is discussed in §11.1.5.
Four diagnostics that are used in defining the six sentence types are:
i whether the sentence includes an interrogative word (§3.9) and/or the question marker
=pe (§11.1.3.2). This is a feature of interrogative and speculative sentences.
ii whether the final marker on the predicate can be followed by either -na ‘SPEC’ or
=nia ‘ASSERT’ (§11.1.2.1). This is a feature that is typically associated with declaratives.
iii whether there is an assumption that the sentence has an addressee subject. This is a
feature of optative and imperative sentences.
iv whether the sentence can be (notionally) reframed as a sensible ‘twin’ counterpart
that has a different value with respect to being interrogative. For example, a declarative sentence can usually have the marker =pe attached to it, resulting in a corresponding interrogative sentence. This feature is characteristic of declarative, optative,
and interrogative sentences.","[438, 439]"

treated as regular verbs in some inflectional categories but not in others. In this
section I identify these verbs and their base forms.
The stance/existential verb ‘sit’ is partially irregular, and has
three base forms. These are shown in Table 8.10.

raoWhilst the base forms of this verb can still be distinguished on the basis of the
final vowel, the way they are used in inflectional operations differs from the full
consonantal verbs and will be addressed separately as the need arises.
There are three known partial members of
the wa-class group, iwa- (level pitch contour)‘plant’, iwa- (fall pitch contour) ‘drop,
fall’ and kua- ‘hide’. The segmental base forms of these verbs are shown in Table
8.11. I have no examples of kua ‘hide’ occurring in an i-base form, so suggest the
form /ki/ based on the usual patterning of wa-class verbs.","[304, 305]"
"3.2NominalsA prototypical semantic property of members of a ‘nominal’ word class is that
they refer to ‘time stable’ concepts (Schachter 1985:6) and designate objects (Evans
2000:710), for example persons and places.
Duna nominal roots can constitute complete nominal phrases (NPs) by themselves, and typically occur in NPs that denote participants in a described event or
relationship (Chapter 5). NPs can also occur as predicates (§4.1.1.1), but unlike
predicating verbs, nominals cannot be marked with TAM markers (§8.2) or the negative circumfix (§8.3). Nominal predicates can however be marked with (a restricted
range of) epistemic assessment markers (§10.3).
I divide Duna nominals into three subclasses: common nouns (§3.2.1), proper
names (§3.2.2), and personal pronouns (§3.2.3). The former two groups are open
classes, to which new members may be added. Personal pronouns comprise a small
closed class. See also §3.9 concerning quasi-nominal interrogative forms.
3.2.1Common nounsCommon nouns typically occur in nominal phrases, where they may be modified by
postposed adjectives, quantifiers, and/or demonstratives (§5.2). A nominal phrase
that includes a common noun may be referential and denote a particular individual
(or group of individuals, etc.), or non-referential, denoting a generic class of items.
Some examples of common nouns are shown in Table 3.1. These are simple root
forms. Common nouns can also be morphologically complex (§5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.3).
Common nouns such as hatia, ‘accessway’, denote a fairly general semantic
field. When used alone, hatia typically means ‘path, road’, but it can alternatively be
preceded by a nominal (in possessor position, see §5.2.6) to form a phrase with more
specific meaning, for example: anda hatia (house accessway) ‘door, doorway’;
ambu hatia (lips accessway) ‘mouth opening’; or khia hatia (faeces accessway)
‘anus’.
Words for describing plants and animals include generic terms such as heka
‘bird’ or rowa ‘tree’, and terms that describe particular varieties of generic types,
such as wawa ‘egret’ and yawale ‘casuarina’. Words that denote individual kinds of
flora and fauna are likely to occur in complex nouns as nominal specifiers following
generic terms (§5.2.1.5).",[99]
"416Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typelanguages). This is basically the case in Duna, albeit somewhat complicated by the
alternative interrogative pattern, in which the interrogative marker links alternate
propositions and is not necessarily reiterated sentence-finally.
11.1.3.3Yes-no interrogatives‘Yes-no’ interrogatives “seek a comment on the degree of truth of the questioned
proposition” (Sadock and Zwicky 1985:178). Examples of Duna yes-no interrogatives are shown in (1026) - (1029), in which the interrogative marker =pe occur
on an otherwise declarative sentences. In Duna yes-no interrogatives typically have
a ‘positive bias’ effect, that is, anticipate a ‘yes’ answer that confirms the proposition. This is in contrast to alternative interrogatives (§11.1.3.4) which are typically
‘unbiased’.

Unlike serialised verbs and predicates that include verb adjuncts, adjunct noun
constructions such as those shown in (547a) to (552) are not usually negated as a
unit, as shown by the unacceptability of (555a). Negation can be expressed through
applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as shown in (555b). Example

omitted at the second iteration of the predicate.

——————————————————————
Figure 7.5 Template of an ‘object-verb predication’Object-verb predications are predications that involve an NP and a verb. They
do not really represent a single formally distinct construction type, as the major
defining criterion is semantic and gradient rather than structural and categorically
discrete. Clauses that include object-verb predications show some characteristics
of ordinary bivalent clauses with subject and object NPs. They also share similarities with adjunct noun constructions in that word order is typically restricted, and
the meaning of the predication is substantially derived from a nominal constituent.
Object-verb predications are similar to ‘restricted collocations’ (Cowie 1998), combinations of words where the meaning of one element is “governed by its association
with another word or phrase” (Pawley 2007:7), for example, the expression ‘meet
demands’ in English. They are also idiomatic under Nunberg et al.’s (1994) definition in that the meaning cannot be predicted from the sum of its parts, and a literal248Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structuresTable 7.10 Some ‘object-verb predication’ expressionsNoun or semantic field

‘cord, fibre ’na‘eat’‘hang oneself’interpretation of the phrase is cases possible, albeit rather odd. Some examples of
object-verb predications are shown in Table 7.10.
It can be seen in Table 7.10 that some object-verb predications are part of a
family of expressions which follow a generalised semantic structure, rather than
being one-off expressions. For example, the existential verb (e)ra- ‘be/put’ occurs
in construction with nouns that denote bodily substances in clauses that describe
extrusion or excretion. The more members there are of the family, the more tenable
it becomes to say that what we are dealing with here is (constructional) polysemy
of the verb (see also §7.5.4.2).
Examples (556) - (560) illustrate some of the expressions shown in Table 7.10.
The apparent ‘object’ noun is unmodified and immediately precedes the verb.
(556)khia ra-ndamaru.faeces be/put-INT go.IMP say.PFV‘Go to shit [he] said.’ (T/PK:201003i) (lit. ‘put shit’)

(560)no eya na-nda.
1SG rope eat-INT‘I will hang myself.’ (lit. eat rope) (ED)
As with adjunct nominal constructions, placing the ‘object’ noun before the subject argument usually doesn’t work; see (561) and (562). This kind of inflexibility
argues against treating the expression as a typical bivalent clause (as subject and
object NPs can normally appear in either SO or OS order, the latter being pragmatically marked).
(561)* heka imane su
bird girlhold.PFV* A woman transformed into a bird (CD/XIV:76)
(Could mean: ‘A woman held a bird.’)
(562)* eya no nanda
cord 1SG eat-INT* I will hang myself (CD/XIV:156)
(Could mean: ‘I will eat cord’)
However, for at least some expressions, the nominal appears to be the head of a
full NP that references a P argument. In (563) the noun is modified by an adjective.
In (564) the noun is marked as specific (that is, is clearly referential) and does not
occur in the same clause as its host verb but in the preceding clause, that is, the
item is referenced through zero anaphora. In (564), there is no reason to analyse
mbalutana ‘the plane’ as anything other than an object NP, beyond the fact that it
collocates with a particular specialised meaning of the verb suwa- ‘hold’. This is
not in itself sufficient grounds to propose a distinct structural relationship.
(563)ho-nanane kete si-tiari-na.there-SPEC boy little hold-PFV.VIS . P say.STAT-SPEC‘This one transformed into a little boy, it is said. ’(T/JS:KG05V5.40)250(564)Chapter 7.

(T/JP:KG05V7.11)
Individual object-verb predications show some differences concerning whether
or not the nominal element and the verb in the construction must be immediately
contiguous. For example, for the phrase khiau suwa- ‘use fire-making kit’, it is
possible for the time/manner word ala to occur in between the constituents (565),
and a locative NP can occur between hapa ‘egg’ and era- ‘put’ in the expression
‘lay eggs’ (566). See also the phrase mali suwa- ‘hold a mali dance’ in (549), in
which an (interrogative) temporal occurs in between the noun and the verb.

However, RA and KK judged that the phrase heka suwa- ‘transform into a bird’
does not allow a temporal to be interposed, as shown in (567) and (568). The expression is fixed, and the special meaning it has cannot be maintained if arrangement of
its elements is disrupted.

Like adjunct noun constructions, object-verb predications do not undergo unitary negation. If the negative circumfix is used it will be applied to the verb only. An
example is shown in (569). However, the lexical negator neya (§8.3.3) is preferred
for object-verb predications.

7.5.4.1251Inceptive/factitive uses of ka- ‘be/stand’
Adjunct noun typeThe verb ka- ‘be/stand’ can occurs in construction with a noun that cannot be identified as denoting an argument, is unmodified, and immediately precedes the verb,
that is, resembles an adjunct noun. However, the derived predication may be either
ambivalent or bivalent. This goes against the usual pattern of adjunct noun constructions, in that the argument structure of the complex predication is different
from that of the verb when it occurs alone as a simple predicate. A general template
for constructions that use employ ka- in this way is shown in Figure 7.6.

Nominals that denote liquids or transferrable substances such as dirt or mud
occur like adjunct nouns with ka- ‘be/stand’ to describe saturation or staining, as
shown in (572) and (573). Example (573) shows that adverbial modifiers such as
peli ‘well, thoroughly’ can either precede the nominal or be interposed between the
nominal and the verb (but not both at the same time).

Examples such as (1008) and (1009) suggest that in at least some circumstances
ritia can have the grammatical status of an epistemic particle, rather than being
part of a construction that has comparable semantics to epistemic marking, but is
structurally distinct from it. However as described in regard to (1005) this not the
case for all speakers, and more data are required to examine the viability of this
structure in natural language.
10.5.3Some constructions with ke- ‘see’The verb ke- ‘see’ can also be used in constructions that expand the evidencemarking repertoire. In these cases, the perception event (the experience of information source) that is entailed by evidential markers is in a sense overtly expressed as
a complement-taking verb.",[431]

(822)kuni khou-pa.
head pain-INDV‘[My] head is hurting.’ (OH/VIII:32)
The sentences shown in (823) illustrate a contrast between inflectional use of
the specificity marker -na (§9.3.2.2) and individual standpoint marker -pa. These
sentences were spoken to me in succession while I was sitting on the verandah
(under cover), and the speaker was passing by outside. Speaking sentence (823a),
the speaker pointed to where light rainfall could be seen sparkling in sunshine.
Speaking (823b), the speaker brushed the tiny drops of water alighting on her arms.
In the first instance, the speaker was pointing something out to me that I could
observe for myself. In the second instance, the speaker adds additional information
from her own individual standpoint, as someone who feels and assesses the rain.

b. ketele yiaomia-mia-pa.little nothing drizzle-drizzle-INDV‘[It is] drizzling just a little bit.’ (brushing arms) (LC/VIII:32)
In (823), the differential use of -pa and -na shows a similarity to the contrast
expressed by certain ‘engagement markers’ in Andoke (Colombia) as described by342Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markersEvans (2005), citing Landaburu (2007). Use of the individual standpoint marker
-pa is comparable to use of the Andoke engagement marker kẽ-, which “directs the
interlocutor to an experience that is hidden from them” (Landaburu 2007, Evans’
translation). The Andoke engagement marker b- contrasts with kẽ- and is comparable in function to the Duna marker -na, as it directs the interlocutor “to an
experience that is in principle tangible” (Landaburu 2007, Evans’ translation).
In making statements about present events -pa is a probably the functionally
unmarked inflection for regular verbs, as it is quite a neutral way to present a proposition in contrast to other options (for example, specificity marking or sensory
evidential marking, §9.2.4.2; see also §9.3.2.3). The information is offered without
making an assertive claim about evidence or noteworthiness. In elicited sentences
that described hypothetical present activities (as opposed to things that were actually happening at the time), speakers I worked with would commonly choose -pa as
a verbal inflection, as in (824) and (825).42 Example (826) shows -pa following the
negative circumfix na–ya (§8.3).

9.3.2.2Specificity marking on final verbsIn this section I introduce a Duna structure which is arguably quite distinct from
final verb inflection, but is in a relationship of functional contrast with all of the inflectional operations described in this and the preceding chapter, and is thus highly
pertinent to a description of verbal morphology. This comprises the use of the
specificity marker -na (§6.3.2.1) on verbs in lieu of final verbal inflection in main
clauses. As noted in §6.3.2.1, Haspelmath (1997:38) defines an expression as specific where “the speaker presupposes the existence and unique identifiability of its
referents”. In this Duna construction, the referent of the expression that is formally
marked as specific is an existing and uniquely identifiable situation (rather than, for
example, a concrete object). I first present examples that illustrate this structure,
42This is particularly true of elicitation conducted early in my fieldwork, when I was focussing on
basic vocabulary collection without any accompanying ‘scenario’.","[370, 371]"
"NOT- INT= OPIN - SPEC say- SEQ‘You have no wings, you will not fly {I opine} [she] said...’ (T/YS:270205)
21Fasu (Namo Me) has a post-verbal particle with the form /pi/ that has similar meaning to the
Duna =pi (May and Loeweke 1980). In both cases it seems plausible that the particle is related to
the Engan subgroup word /pi(i)/ ‘language’ (Lang 1973; Rule 1977; Lomas 1988), building on the
idea of thought as internal utterance.",[422]
"3.5AdjectivesI refer to a group of Duna words that have formal features of both nominal and
verbal roots and generally describe properties of things as adjectives. Like nominals and unlike verbs, adjectives can occur as clausal predicates in bare root form
(§4.1.1.2). They may also occur as modifiers in nominal phrases (§5.2.2). Adjectival
roots can be inflected with some morphology that is not available to nominal roots,
for example the habitual inflection -na (see, for example, (50)). Certain adjectives
can occur in a complex predicate construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, describing the inception or achievement of a change of state (§7.5.4.3).15
Some examples of Duna adjectives are shown in Table 3.7. I have grouped together adjectives that have some semantic features in common (for example, dealing
with dimension), but I do not propose that each group represents a distinct category.
The forms in Table 3.7 represent the four ‘core semantic types’ that are typically associated with the word class adjective (dimension, age, value and colour), as well as
the ‘peripheral semantic types’ of physical property and human propensity (Dixon
2004).
As can be seen in Table 3.7, many adjectival words finish with a sequence Vo. In
Duna as spoken in the Kopiago area, the final o is subject to deletion in some lexical
items with no clear change in meaning or function.16 It is highly likely that this
final o is a semi-fossilised reflex of the perfective verbal inflection, -o (§8.2.2.1).17
13Note that I designate these forms as members of a particular word class rather than as constituents that are occupying a particular structural/functional position in construction with a verb.
This Duna word class could also be termed that of ‘coverbs’, following the use of this term in the
Australianist literature.
14
As a general rule, if the root is not attested occurring with final verb morphology (or has been
judged unacceptable in combination with it), typically occurs in bare root form, and immediately
precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb in all known examples, I interpret it as a verb adjunct, not a
verb.
15
The root kete ‘small’ can additionally be used in adverbial expressions (see, for example, (425)).
However this is not a general characteristic of adjectival roots.
16
Results of the orthography survey carried out with Duna speakers from the Kelabo area suggest
that deletion of the o is not acceptable for speakers of the south-west Duna variety.

‘nubile (male or female)’
‘cold’
‘hot’
‘important’
‘new, unready’
‘ripe’
‘rotten, falling apart’
‘tasty’
‘hard’ (GG)This analysis would suggest that the roots in question originally had a more clearly
inceptive or progressive meaning (e.g., ‘become big’, ‘become yellow’) and that the
perfective inflection was added to indicate complete achievement of the specified
change. This can also be argued for those adjectival roots that end in u, as the
perfective inflection has an allomorph -u.
Some adjectival roots, such as kete ‘small’, typically occur in nominal phrases
whereas others such as rakare ‘cold’ typically occur as predicates of verbal clauses.
The latter term can be negated with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3), whereas
the former cannot. The behaviour of all adjectival roots with respect to this property
is not known. However, it is likely that further study will provide formal evidence
for the existence of different noun-like and verb-like classes within the proposed
group of adjectival roots, primarily relating to a distinction between properties that
are more time-stable, and those that are more dynamic.","[109, 110]"

Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markers9.3. Information status markers349In addressing the status of the ‘other’ designations within Figure 9.1, the possibility of treating information source as an obligatorily expressed domain in verbal
inflection becomes relevant, as discussed with respect to past time events in §9.2.9.
The choice between SNS markers and other forms can be expressed as a selection between two kinds of information source: that which is ‘firsthand’, comprising visuo-perceptive, participatory, and factual information source; and that which
is ‘non-firsthand’, comprising non-visuo-perception, and being extended to certain
kinds of inference concerning ongoing events (as illustrated in (769) in §9.2.4.2).47
Under the ‘stative’ node the distinction can again be characterised as one that is
entirely to do with information source, ‘visual’ versus ‘participatory/factual’.
Under this reading, inflectional options that relate to present-time situations
comprise a functional paradigm within which evidentiality is an obligatory grammatical category: a speaker has a finite set of morphological options, all of which
encode information source. As for the perfective inflection, whether or not TAM
markers such as a the stative and imperfective inflections do indeed encode information source is something of a moot point, and further data are needed to examine
this issue. There is some evidence to support the view that these forms are ‘positively’ evidential (for example, the fact that they can, like evidential markers, be
followed by -na SPEC, see §10.2) and some evidence against it (for example, the
fact that IPFV can occur in combination with evidential markers, and that the stative
inflection can be followed by epistemic particles).
Regardless of whether or not these forms are identified as necessarily evidential
morphemes, it can be seen that the parameter of information source (like that of
aspect as outlined in §8.2.3.7) has quite a profound effect concerning the possible
articulation of possible primary inflections as a system or group of subsystems, and
is a particularly important factor within the inflectional inventory.
9.3.3
9.3.3.1Past time events
Recent past, shared standpointThe bound form -ra (SHRD) occurs as a verbal inflection on predications that represent very recent activities, and indicates that the speaker assesses the proposition as
representing collective knowledge that is shared by both speaker and hearer.48 The
47This kind of firsthand/non-firsthand semantic split is not uncommon in evidential systems of the
world (see Aikhenvald 2004; Johansen and Utas 2000), and there is some indication that it is the
way the (relatively) nearby Angal system operates in the denotation of present time events (Madden
MS, Reithofer pers. comm.).
48
As for the individual standpoint marker -pa (§9.3.2.1), -ra occurs very rarely as a final inflection
in monologic narrative text, and my analysis of this form is provisional. Looking on the bright side,
the low frequency of the ‘standpoint’ markers -pa and -ra in narrative data is itself interesting, as
it contrasts markedly with the distribution of most other verbal inflections. TAM inflections and
evidential markers are readily deployed in narrative to index features of the narrative-internal world,350Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markerspredicated activity is typically something that the speaker and hearer did and/or
witnessed in each other’s company, and/or something they have conversed about,
each having contributed to the other’s understanding of the event. This morpheme
is similar to the ‘referential’ marker in Pole (Engan Family), as described by Rule
(1977).
The shared standpoint marker -ra is added to the o-base of consonantal verbs
(including the semi-irregular verb ra- ‘sit’), the i-base of wa-class verbs, and the
i-base or a-base of partial wa-class verbs. Giles (MSa) describes -ra as the ‘perfect’
or ‘general perfect’ past tense.
Some examples of -ra are shown in (834) - (837). These illustrate that -ra
is commonly used in describing events that have just happened in the immediate
sphere of the speech situation. The predicated activity is something that the speaker
assumes has already been introduced into the ‘knowledge store’ (Vallduvı́ 1992) of
the speaker and hearer, either through the fact of it happening, or through reference
to it in conversation, or both. KK suggested that the sentence shown in (835) would
be suitable as a response if Person A had just thrown something over to Person B
and then asked them if they had caught it. In (836) ra occurs following the negative
circumfix na- -ya (§8.3).
(834)ayu ho-ra.
now come-SHRD‘I just arrived.’ (CD/VIII:70)
(835)B: si-ra.

(836)anoa ha-nakonane kharu-ta na-waki-ya-ra.man there-SPEC earblock-SEQ NEG-hear-NEG-SHRD‘That man is deaf and didn’t hear.’ (Giles MSa:L27)
Example (837) is from a conversation in which the speaker and I were taking
turns looking through binoculars. The speaker was using the binoculars and I asked
her something about what she could see. She was surprised at my question, as I had
just had a turn a few moments previously; her response is something of a rebuke.
(837)ko ke-ra.
2SG see-SHRD‘You just looked!’ (LC)
either through the adoption of a main character’s viewpoint, or within reported speech (that may
or may not be overtly marked as such). This difference in distribution suggests that as inflectional
forms the standpoint markers are very closely tied to the actual speech situation and the identities of
speaker and hearer, and that this reference is not readily transferable to the narrated world.","[376, 377, 378, 379]"
"196Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphologyThere are no examples in my data of -kuru combining with the interrogative pa‘query’ to form an interrogative meaning ‘what places?’ (or similar). However,
the form pa-kuru does occur in the textual data in a specialised construction that
is used to describe mysterious or extraordinary places, typically those that are the
realm of pikono narrative (§1.3.3.1) and can never be known by people in ordinary,
everyday way. Pakuru follows a verbal clause (predication ‘X’) in a phrase that
means something like ‘places where X happens’. Two examples are shown in (369)
and (370).28 In (369), the speaker describes how a woman in a story (who has
wandered off, flouting the express orders of her brother) is charmed by a water spirit
and led down into his mysterious world of underground rivers (see Haley 2002). In
(370), the hero of a pikono story takes leave of his beautiful female companion,
going off on a journey of his own into distant regions of the pikono world.

6.4.4Other ways of denoting locationsIn this section I describe some further kinds of referring expressions that denote
times and places, in order to give a fuller picture of how description of spatial and
temporal locations can be included in a clause.
28I find this construction difficult to analyse, and to do so would require a more comprehensive
analysis of Duna (including further examination of complex sentences) than is attempted in this
thesis. However, I believe it is suggestive of a relationship between the interrogative root pa and
the ‘individual standpoint’ marker pa that occurs as a verbal inflection (§9.3.2.1). Briefly, it makes
sense to interpret the interrogative root ‘query’ and the predicate marker ‘INDV’ as (deriving from)
a single form pa which is concerned with not knowing. This is commensurate with the occurrence
of forms such as -ra ‘SHRD’ as both an epistemic demonstrative and a predicate marker. The interrogative function of pa (‘query’) relates to the epistemic demonstrative function of forms such as
-ra, and indicates that the referent of a phrase is not known (specifically, not known to the speaker
but assumed to be known to the addressee). When it marks a final predicate, pa (INDV) indicates
that the speaker knows about the predicated activity, but assumes that this is individual knowledge,
not necessarily shared by the addressee. Examples such as (369) and (370) give a window into a
situation where pa is exploited as: a form that is demonstrative-like, as it is followed by the place
phrase marker -kuru in a referring expression; and a marker that affixes to a verb root in a clause that
describes an ‘unknown’ situation.","[224, 225]"

This sentence was considered interpretable but odd, and I have not found any textual examples that follow this pattern so it is clearly dispreferred. The meaning is
apparently the same as for unitary negation, that is, negation still applies to both
verbs.

PSNsina-nga-ya=3SG pandanus hold NEG-go-NEG? Kenny isn’t carrying the pandanus away (CD/VII:3)
7.3.3Relationships between verbs in seriesIn this section I describe some different semantically defined relationships between
verbs that occur in series.
7.3.3.1Sequential and overlapping activitiesSome verb series describe a series of distinct activities time iconically. The activity
described by the first verb in the series is completed before the activity described
by the next verb begins. Vn is typically telic. An example is shown in (493) (see
also example 482). The verb roots are bivalent, and the identity of the A and P
participants is the same for both verbs.
(493)ita sei si-yarindi ho-takiti-pa.pig hit hold-DEP ground here-LOC descend-IMP‘Kill pigs and take them down to the ground there’ (T/YS:270205)
Some verbs in series describe activities that are more-or-less discernible as distinct activities, but there is a significant amount of overlap between them. The
activity of the first verb continues throughout the activity of the second verb and
the meaning of the SVC is typically related to relocating something. Two examples
are shown in (494) and (495). Vn is a bivalent verb of ‘retaining’ and Vlast is a
monovalent verb of motion. The subject is the same for both verbs in series.

"8.2. Tense, aspect and event modality (TAM)279and are thus ‘terminal’ inflections.
TAM markers can be grouped together in a number of alternative ways which
cut across the three groups as presented in §8.2.2 - §8.2.4. Different semantic, functional, and formal features of the morphemes compel different articulations of how
they relate to each other. For example, it makes sense to identify TAM markers
that are used in the description of actualised rather than potential events as a discrete group that encodes aspect as the primary organisational parameter, and this is
outlined in §8.2.3.7.
Duna verbs are not marked with pronominal agreement affixes,11 and TAM
markers do not mark person as such (that is, they do not alternate strictly according
to the number and person of certain clausal arguments). However, certain (declarative) TAM markers have a distributional pattern that correlates with subject identity,
and this pattern generally follows ‘conjunct/disjunct’ alignment (§11.2.1.1). The
Duna intentive inflection (§8.2.2.3), promissive inflection (§8.2.3.5), and the special
present inflection of the verb nga- ‘go’ (§8.2.3.6) typically occur with speaker subjects in declarative sentences and addressee subjects in questions (show conjunct
distribution). The prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) typically occurs with non-speaker
subjects in declarative sentences and non-addressee subjects in interrogative sentences (shows disjunct distribution).
The conjunct/disjunct pattern is generally concerned with the relationship between
a participant (most commonly S or A) of a verbal clause and the person in the utterance situation who is the epistemic source (Hargreaves 2005) with regard to the
proposition. For example, it is typically sensitive to whether the person in the speech
situation who has (best access to) knowledge of the described event also figures as
an agentive participant in it. The nature and implications of this distributional pattern in Duna are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. For the time-being I focus
in the main on the basic meanings of these TAM markers in declarative sentences,
although a few interrogative examples are also introduced.
Because of the significance of the conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern to
Duna grammar, it is useful to have a quasi-‘person’ term (additional to and cutting across the grammatical categories of first, second, and third person encoded in
the Duna personal pronouns) that refers to the speaker of a declarative sentence, and
the addressee of an interrogative sentence. I use the term ‘informant’ for this kind
of person, following Bickel (2001) (as reported in Bickel and Nichols 2007). Note,
however, that my use of the term informant is not identical to that of Bickel, who
defines informant functionally as “the person whom the speaker supposes or claims
11Foley (2000:377) notes that a lack of such affixes is “relatively uncommon” in languages of
New Guinea.","[307, 308]"

Examples (765) - (767) show the sensory current morpheme being used in predications that describe physical and/or emotional sensations. In (768) the negative
circumfix (§8.3) is also present, applied prior to the evidential marker.

——————————————————————————–
Figure 8.1 Final predicate morphologyAncillary markers follow inflected verbs or non-verbal predicates, and provide
further information concerning someone’s (typically the speaker’s) assessment of
the proposition encoded in the clause to which it attaches, for example, as something that is certainly the case, or as something that has been learnt thought a certain kind of evidence. In certain cases with verbal predicates the ancillary marker
combines with the primary inflection to form what I term a complex finite inflection. Otherwise, ancillary markers are optional extra forms that can be removed
with no consequences as to the grammatically independent status of the clause. The
occurrence of ancillary markers on final predicates is described in Chapter 10.
I identify four groups of bound forms that can be employed as primary inflections and/or ancillary markers on final predicates. These are: TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers and epistemic particles. These groups are
primarily identified on a formal basis, with some input from semantic features. The
possible functions of TAM markers, evidential markers, information status markers
and epistemic particles with respect to the primary inflection vs ancillary marker
distinction are shown in Table 8.1.

contrastive, mutually exclusive, and only occur in the primary inflectional position,
that is, directly attached to the verb with no intervening inflectional morphology.
Evidential markers (§9.2) are a set of mutually exclusive forms that specify cer-8.1. Introduction269tain features of information source as primary meanings, indicating for example
that a situation was visually observed. Information status markers (§9.3) encode
features concerning (the speaker’s judgement of) what kind of knowledge the information represents, for example, whether it is surprising or self-evident. I refer
to the broad semantic domain encoded by these forms as ‘epistemic assessment’
(§9.1). Evidential and information status markers can occur as primary inflections
on verbal predicates, in which case they establish features of the verbal event’s actualisation and temporal status, as well as specifying meanings that relate to epistemic
assessment. The majority of evidential markers, and some information status markers, can also occur as ancillary markers, in which case they do not independently
determine time features of the denoted situation, but take scope over a proposition
that is already marked for temporal and modality features.
Epistemic particles (§10.4) only occur as ancillary markers. Like evidential and
information status markers, the primary meanings of these forms are to do with
epistemic assessment, relating to the presentation of a proposition as representing a
certain kind of knowledge, for example, a personal opinion held by the speaker.
8.1.1.2Primary inflections and the final verbBound morphemes that can occur as primary inflections on final verbs are listed in
Tables 8.2 - 8.5. A short description is included that outlines the typical import of
each morpheme when it is used in a non-interrogative sentence (roughly, a directive
or statement) as a primary inflection, and is not further followed by an ancillary
form.
The morphemes have been divided into separate tables according to the kind of
reference situation that they are typically used in. These divisions do not map exactly to the way that the morphemes are presented in this and the following chapter,
as the overall organisation of these chapters follows the TAM vs evidential vs information status marker distinction. Rather, the tables are provided here to give
an overview of the semantic range of markers that are in broad functional contrast
within parameters regarding the illocutionary force of the utterance, and the actuality and time of the event in question. Some issues concerning how these parameters
build functional paradigms of verbal inflection in Duna that cut across different
formal classes of morphemes are discussed at various points in this and the following chapter.
Tables 8.2 - 8.5 show those forms that are typically used as primary inflections
in statements, where a speaker tries to communicate the proposition of the utterance as something that can be treated as ‘information’. These are further divided
according to the relative time and actuality of the event in question, being classified270Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negationas generally referring to past (Table 8.2), present/habitual2 (Table 8.3), or potential time (Table 8.4). Table 8.5 shows those morphemes that are typically used in
directive utterances where the speaker tries to get other people to perform (or not
perform) the denoted action.
The inflections shown in Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 are drawn from the TAM
marker, evidential marker, and information status marker groups (shown in the table
in that order, divided by horizontal lines). Inflections that relate to potential time are
all TAM markers except for one information status marker, included in the bottom
row. Directive inflections are all classified as TAM markers.","[296, 297, 298, 299]"

9.3.4
9.3.4.1Potential events (‘provocative’ inflections)
IntroductionThe ‘expective’ (§9.3.4.2) and ‘potential observation’ (§9.3.4.3) markers occur with
inflectional function only. These forms are rare in the textual data; I first became
aware of their existence from Giles (MSa).52 I collectively term these inflections the
‘provocative’ markers because they are used when the speaker wishes to provoke the
addressee’s attention towards the predicated activity in a particular way.
The expective and potential observation inflections both allude to potential events.
In the case of the expective inflection, a clause that is so marked describes a potential
event that the speaker thinks the addressee should think about before taking a course
of action. In the case of the potential observation inflection, the potential event is
not the activity denoted by the verb itself, but the addressee’s potential witnessing
of this activity. I find it illuminating to think of these forms as being to do with a
kind of event modality (§8.2.1) that is oriented toward the addressee’s awareness of
the predicate event. The speaker expresses a modal attitude towards the addressee’s
knowledge store, indicating that the addressee either should know or could have
seen something, thus showing some commonality with impersonal evidentials.53 In
using these markers the speaker urges the addressee to take epistemic responsibility
for the predicated activity by either recognising it as a pertinent piece of information that should inform their actions (expective), or considering the evidence of the
predicated activity that could be available to them (potential observation).54
52Giles (MSa) terms the forms I label expective and potential observation as ‘general experience’
and ‘past known to speaker’, respectively. The latter term is transparent. She defines the use of the
‘general experience’ forms as being used “when a statement is based on the speaker’s knowledge
from his general experience of what has or will happen in a certain situation” (MSa:37).
53
Molochieva’s (2006) Chechen data, as presented in Bickel (2007), intimates that the special
addressee-directed construction evidential/mirative in this language has overtones of a (deontic)
modal attitude to the addressee’s knowledge, and expresses the speaker’s opinion that the addressee
‘must know’ or ‘must have noticed’ the predicated event.
54
A possibility remains that the provocative inflections evoke an impersonal viewpoint, rather
than specifically targeting epistemic features in regard to the addressee. That is, they may be more
appropriately paraphrased as something like ‘it could have been seen’ rather than ‘you could have356Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markersThe provocative inflections are commonly associated with two kinds of speech
acts, giving directives and eliciting information (see also §11.1). A verb inflected
as expective or potential observation rarely occurs utterance-finally in my data, as
in most cases the provocative clause is immediately followed by an instruction or
question for the addressee. These markers have somewhat intermediate status as
final verb inflections, and could alternatively be interpreted as a medial inflections.
Under either analysis it is necessary to make some additional stipulations concerning their uses.55
9.3.4.2Expective markerThe expective inflection marks events that the speaker thinks likely to happen or
likely to have happened. It additionally implies something of a warning or reproach
to the addressee, as it marks a situation that the speaker thinks the addressee should
already have paid attention to or considered. A warning implication (‘look out,
this bad thing could happen’ ) is particularly common, so that the expective usually
functions similarly to an ‘admonitive’ (for example, in Maidu Shipley 1964), or ‘apprehensive’ (for example, in Australian languages.). However, the implication that
the marked clause represents a specifically negative consequence is not a necessary
feature (see (853) and (854)).
With regular verbs, the marker -nanoko is added to the root. For consonantal
verbs, the form -nako is added to the a-base, and for wa-class verbs -nako is added
to the a-base form, or -nanako to the u-base.56
Clauses that are marked with the expective inflection are commonly accompanied by an instruction, as in (851) - (854). The speaker immediately supplies
direction on how the addressee should act on the information they are being given.

seen’. Further data are needed to explore this issue, for example concerning the acceptability of
second person subject with these forms.
55
It is significant that the provocative markers end in the sequence ko; the form -ko occurs as a
productive marker of subordination, following a final inflection (see, for example, (1012)). However,
in the case of the expective and potential observation markers it is not helpful to say that ko is
occurring as a marker of subordination, as it is not possible to coherently identify the sequences to
which it is added as productive inflectional forms.
56
Further data are needed to establish whether the two possibilities for wa-class verbs are contrastive. Giles’ data include only the a-base + nako option.","[383, 384, 385]"
"452Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typeand, from the available data, are only moderately compatible with evidential and/or
information status markers.
In general, evidential markers, information status markers and epistemic particles
show a certain amount of functional flexibility. For example, the form -yanua
(SNS . IMPL) functions as a verbal primary inflection (§9.2.7), a component in complex inflections (§10.2.2), a component in extra evidence constructions (§10.2.3),
an ancillary marker on non-verbal predications (§10.3), and an epistemic demonstrative in participant and place reference (§6.2). Most evidential and some information status markers can function as primary inflections, or as ancillary markers that
follow an inflected final verb or non-verb predicate. The impersonal and current
sensory (and possibly also visual) evidentials, information status marker -ra, and
epistemic particle =pi, all occur as epistemic demonstrative forms. This is in contrast to, for example, TAM markers (§8.2), which only occur as verbal inflections,
and to proximal demonstratives (§5.2.4.1), which only occur as NP constituents.
An important commonality in bound forms that make reference to knowledge in
some way is what can be termed the ‘speaker-proposition’ relationship, following
on from the work of Rule (1977), where he foreshadows De Haan’s (2005) examination of evidentiality as a deictic category (§11.2.2.5). In describing the evidential
system of Foe (East Kutubu, PNG) Rule remarks that after initially interpreting
Participatory and Visual evidential inflections as subject person agreement markers, he realised that, “the basic relationship [encoded by these morphemes] was not
between subject and the verb but between speaker and the verb” (1977:71). I find
the identification of a ‘speaker-verb’ (or speaker-proposition) relationship highly
relevant to the morphological encoding of epistemic assessment in Duna in two
ways.
Firstly, it is relevant to the way that evidential markers position the informant
person as holding a kind of ‘meta-role’ in a narrated event. This meta-role can be
loosely defined as that of a bystander, someone who observes an event, but does
not exert active control over it. Given the non-participation of the informant that
is implied by evidential marking, it is unusual for evidentials to be used when the
informant is also the volitional subject of the marked verb, as discussed in §11.2.2.
The fact that non-participation is normally presupposed can be employed in conveying greater or lesser degrees of distance between the informant and the proposition,
regardless of whether or not they are an argument of the marked clause, as exemplified in §11.2.2.6.
Secondly, it is relevant to the way that markers of epistemic assessment always
imply ‘speakers’, not just in the sense of the actual speakers of particular utter-11.3. Epistemic assessment and the final predicate: an overview453ances, but people who can think and talk - those with conscious minds.31 Typically the ‘conscious minds’ that markers of epistemic assessment evoke are those
of people in the actual discourse situation, the speaker and addressee. Information
status markers, for example, do not only indicate how the speaker thinks/knows
about the activity that is predicated in his or her utterance, but encode awareness that
the addressee also thinks, and has a particular state of mind as regards the proposition. This awareness is also evident in the viewpoint shift exhibited by evidential
markers in questions, by which the speaker can effectively tell the addressee ‘how to
know’. The impersonal evidential markers alternatively allude to consciousness that
is anchored in unspecified people, indicating that the predicated event is observable
through the relevant perceptual faculty, without identifying exactly whose.
Using bound markers of epistemic assessment thus requires paying close attention at some level to the fact that the ‘information’ of spoken language is expressive
of human consciousness, and constituted (as well as constitutive) of human experience. This may be experience of the outside world, or the more internal experience
of ‘having things in mind’.
The theme of the speaker-proposition relationship carries through to some of the
inflectional morphemes that I identify as TAM markers (§8.2) rather than evidential
or information status markers. The encoding of a ‘relationship to mind’ is important
to the meanings of the intentive and prophetic inflections, which imply intention and
(visuo-)perception, respectively. These forms display the same kind of patterns with
respect to subject identity and volition as the evidential markers, so that a clause so
marked says something about the relationship of the informant to the activity that is
described. Certain other inflections that have to do with event modality also appeal
to a person’s internal construal of an event (for example, as something desirable),
and show a comparable alternation as regards the identity of the subject in optative
as opposed to interrogative sentences.
Bound forms that provide indication of epistemic assessment in Duna do not
comprise a discrete grammatical category. Certain formal characteristics typify certain collections of morphemes, but these do not map consistently to distinct semantic or functional domains. For example, I find it sensible to treat the forms
identified as evidential markers as comprising a discrete paradigm, but these do not
stay tidily in their box according to rigorous formal and semantic criteria. Typical
formal features of the evidential markers (for example, the ability to be added to

7.5.4.3Adjective + ka-Some adjectives can be marked with verbal inflections and head verbal clauses.
Verbal clauses headed by an adjective are monovalent and generally atelic, describing a constant state rather than a changing process. Alternatively, adjectival roots
may occur as part of a complex predicate preceding the verb ka- ‘be/stand’. The
general pattern of this construction is represented in Figure 7.8. As can be seen
from a comparison of this structure with that shown in Figure 7.3, the adjectival
root is somewhat equivalent to a verb adjunct in a verb adjunct construction.

As with the visual perfective, in declaratives the visual stative is generally restricted to predicates that do not have a speaker subject.

9.2.4.1Sensory evidential markers
IntroductionSensory evidence morphemes typically indicate that the informant’s evidence for
the proposition is direct but not visual. This includes information sources that are
perceived through the senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch, as well as other
physical or emotional sensations (for example, temperature, fear). They may also
mark predications that are surmised or prophetically envisioned by the informant.17
The predicate is understood to have the same time reference in relation to the time
of utterance as the perception of the evidence. That is, predicates specified as having current evidence are understood to be happening at the time of utterance, and
predicates specified as having previous evidence are understood to have occurred
prior to the time of utterance.
In terms of attested cross-linguistic evidential categories, this Duna category
can be compared to to the ‘Auditory’ and ‘Other sensory’ categories as discussed
16In this case it does not seem correct to say that the verb has stative sense. Rather, the visual
evidence category is chosen in order to signify maximally direct observation of the event, and the
further choice between perfective and stative aspectual specification is made on a ‘best-fit’ basis.
See also (779).
17
Of all of these possibilities, the primary meaning is generally recognised as having to do with
auditory evidence. For example KK and RA suggested that the Duna verb which most suitably
describes the context for these morphemes is waki- ‘hear, listen’. (In my experience this verb, unlike
more general ‘perceive’ predicates such as the Tok Pisin ‘harim’, is not commonly used for any act
of perception other than aural perception.)9.2. Evidential markers319by Willett (1988) and the ‘non-visual sensory’ category discussed by Aikhenvald
(2004).
9.2.4.2Sensory (current)The sensory current morpheme -yarua indicates that an event is experienced as
sensory evidence at the time of utterance. It is added to the a-base of consonantal
and semi-consonantal verbs, the i-base of wa-class verbs, and the i-base or a-base
of partial members of the wa-class group.
Examples (763) and (764) show two uses of the sensory (current) with auditory
evidence.18
