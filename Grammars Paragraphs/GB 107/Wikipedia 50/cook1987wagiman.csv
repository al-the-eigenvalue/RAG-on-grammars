"Conditional (CONDIT) constructions include not only 'if
then' types, but also 'this so that' sentences. Both types
are functionally similar: the first clause contains a proposition which is potentially true, and the second clause
describes an event which is the logical or projected implication of the truth of the first clause. No examples were
recorded where the first clause was negative, however, and
speakers tended to re-phrase English prompt sentences so
that the first clause was always
- -~ositive,usually by using
a different verb; it did not seem apparent on these occasions that the negative examples were grammatically impossible, but rather that their contexts were not appropriate
at the time.

"Chapter 10Adverbs, interjections and interrogationAdverbs and interjections form closed classes which contain
a small number of members only. Adverbs have mood, spatial
position and temporal marking functions, and can modify noun
phrases, verbs or whole clauses. Some of the 16 recorded
adverbs have more than one meaning, or two or more closely
connected meanings. For example, dyumbany can have the
spatial meaning 'behind' or the temporal meaning 'afterwards, last', while gorro can mean either 'tried but failed'
or 'later'.
The class of interjections includes the words wi'ya 'no' and
yaray 'yes'. There is also a word gale which generally
occurs in clause-final position as a tag question, but can
also occur alone to mean 'Is that true?' or 'Really?'. Its
word class membership is thus somewhat difficult to define,
but is described with interjections in 10.2 below.
Polar interrogati,on is signalled by a marked intonation
pattern over the sen.tence as a whole. So-called 'WH' questions variously involve the use of interrogative nominals,
adverbs or a participle, depending on what is being questioned in the clause. The interrogative nominals can also
have case-marking, again depending on sentential requirements.
10.1AdverbsAdverbs form a small closed class whose members have a relatively limited range of meanings. Their semantic functions
include the expression of sentential mood values, such as
negation, doubt and non-completion of the activity described
by the verb or predicate. Also included is a group of nondeictic locating expressions which indicate the spatial
position of one NP relative t r ~another, such as 'on top' ,
'behind' and so on.
In a notional definition of adverbs
these words would be excluded from membership in the classbecause they do not modify a verb or a sentence. Scme meanings expressed by Wagiman adverbs would be included in three
distinct word classes in some other Australian languages,
described as 'adverbals', 'locational qualifiers' and 'part'Locational qualifiers' desicles' (Dixon 1980:281-84).
cribed by Dixon can often be inflected, however, although
'particles' are usually uniuflecting (ibid.).
The class
designated by Dixon as 'adverbals' have the same morphological possibdlites as verbs, and thus do not corespond to
Wagiman 'adverbs'. It should be recalled that the primary
criteria for the definition of word classes given in Chapter
4 were grammatical:
distribution, range of possible syntactic functions and specifiable morphological categories.
Despite their apparently disparate meanings, Wagiman
'adverbs' are classified together because of their similar
grammatical characteristics; the term 'adverb' is chosen
because a major notional function of the class is, in fact,
the modification of verbs and clauses.
101.1dyamba 'cannot, rill not, do not'dyarba has three distinct meanings depending on grammatical
context: (i) it is used to express the subject or agent's
inability to carry out the activity expressed by the verb;
(ii) it marks a lack of desire to carry out this activity;
and (iii) in finite verb imperatives it marks a negative
command not to carry out the activity (cf. 7.2.3).
Generally, context provides information to distinguish between
the 'lack of desire1 and 'inability' meanings; often, however, the distinction is not clear or contextually required,
and 'cannot' and 'will not' are indistinguishable. The
unifying feature of these three meanings is that they all
deny, apart from negating, the possibility expressed by the
predicate of the clause. dyamba is thus used only for
irrealis situations, and is thus glossed as 'Irrealis negative' (IRR NEG):-10-1ga-qa-bu

imperatives do not occur: each participle is an entire and

10.3InterrogationInterrogation is of two functional types: polar interrogation, involving questions which can be answered with yaway
'yes' or wi3ya 'no', and non-polar interrogation, where
yaray or ri'ya are inaproppriate responses. Non-polar
interrogation involves so-called 'WH' questions, in which an
interrogative element of some type is required in the question, and which defines what is being questioned.
Polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical
with declarative sentences, but differ in their intonation
contour; generally, major constituent order is unaffected.
Polar question intonation is not well understood, with few
examples occurring in the tape-recorded corpus.
Auditory
impressions of non-recorded examples indicate that suchquestions have a generally rising intonation over the final
syllables, in opposition to declaratives which have a generally falling final intonation contour. Alternations in word
order due to pragmatic factors can alter this dramatically,
with rising intonation occurring over single clause-initial
items if only they are being queried. However, this is not
an area that has been well recorded, and no concrete examples can be discussed here.","[300, 301]"
"In such examples, the distinction between the question and
Irrealis negative interpretation of the sentence is through
its intonation contour.",[301]

is unclear; there is no evidence suggesting either homonymy
or an original polysemy. As an interrogative form, dyamba
questions the time of a predicate activity which has not yet
taken place, and thus carries irrealis meaning.",[301]
"4.3ParticiplesParticiples form an open class which 4 s functionally quite
complex, having various features of nominals, adverbs and
verbs.
However, they are simply identified formally and
syntactically: they can be suffixed with the Dative, Ablative and Allative case suffixes to express adclausal complements; they can occur in a clause with a verb, marked for
Punctual or Sequential aspect and, when transitive, can have
an overt nominal object argument; they can be suffixed with
the nominal privative marker to express negative imperative
utterances; they can be suffixed with the nominal comitative
suffix to function as predicates of another nominal; and
they can occur alone, either unmarked or marked for punctual
aspect, as positive imperatives.
When they occur as case-marked adclausal elements, these
items clearly function as nominals, and can be substituted
for by them; when they occur as imperatives (even when suffixed with the nominal privative marker) they are clearly
functioning as predicates. This latter feature is more
apparent when they have their own nominal object argument.
Their 'adverbial' function is only notional, but some participles have positional and orientational meanings where they
describe the manner of the action ('upwards', 'downwards',
'inside, inwards, within', 'outside, outwards, without').
Many part-iciples also occur with copula verbs where they
appear to have predicative nominal meanings, such as 'sick',
'hot' and 'sated'.
The class of participles includes items whose meanings would
place them in other classes in some other languages. The
open participle class tends to compensate for the closed
verb and adverb classes by having members which express
functionally verb-like and adverb-like meanings. Many words
whose meanings could potentially be coded as predicative
nominals actually occur as participles. This situation j\-4\-0
makes identifying an appriate name for the class more diffi$'
cult than for others because of the wide range of notionaland semantic functions covered, and the range of syntactic
possibilities expressed. Although these items are not deverbal or otherwise derived forms, the name 'participle' is
used here because of the nominal and predicate functions
which these words have, in much the same way as the 'participle' forms of English and other European languages' verbs
can have both.predicate and argument features.4
4.4AdverbsAdverbs form an apparently closed class, the members of
which are unsuffixed and occur in clauses containing at
least a verb.
Sub-classes of mood, manner, position and
time can be identified. The mood adverbs are dyamba 'canndt , do not ' , r u d y i ' N E G A T I V E ' , menuny 'perhaps' , g o r r o
' tried but failed ' and manya ' can, must '
Many of the manner, time and position adverbs have meanings which allow
them to occur in more than one sub-classification, suggesting that only one other sub-class including them all can be
justified. However, approximate groups are: dyumbany
'last, afterwards, behind' and yoggona ' first , before, in
front' (both manner and position function), dyapan 'slowly',
g a h a 'fast' (manner function only); position adverbs wolok
'on top', wrnrya 'underneath', d a b a l i 'beside, around', dubay
'low down, downstream', gaqga 'high up, uphill'; and time
adverbs goko 'still, again' and ylmbama 'all the time' (as
well as gorro 'later').","[109, 110, 111]"

10,2InterjectionsInterjections are few in number and include mamak 'goodbye',

polar questions.
The short forms yu and yo are used for'yes' in response to requests for attention or when being
addressed. ri'ya also occurs with the nominal gala 'very'
to reinforce the negation, or to mean, 'I don't know', for

It is difficult to determine the exact difference in value
and function between participle-only imperatives and finite
verb+participle imperatives. One possible distinction that
could underlie the choice of either is the explicit reference to the addressee in the finite verb pronominal prefix.
On the other hand, the second person and deictic reference
of the participle imperatives are defined in the same way as
that of the finite verb constructions: a referent (the
addressee) is given only by context in all second person
utterances (that is, by direct address if no name is used).
The overt marking for the second person addressee in finite
imperative clauses is thus no more explicit than that indicated solely by context in participle imperatives. A number
distinction remains as the only characterist-ic of finite
imperatives which participle imperatives do not have, andwhich would seem to be of even less importance than the
presence or absence of pronominal marking.
One difference that can be distinguished is illocutionary,
and participle-only participles seem to have more imperative
force than finite verb+participle forms.
Participle-only
imperatives have the effective discourse status of interjections, and carry a relatively high amount of illocutionary force. Their brevity (never more than four syllables,
even for the negative forms and carrying only one tonic
stress) also permits them to be uttered with a great deal of
articulary force in any conversational exchange or speech
situation. In 9-36 and 9-39 where a participle-only imperative occurs in the same utterance as a finite verb+participle imperative, the former construction occurs as the last
item in the sentence. In this position it has the illocutionary effect of reinforcing the command expressed in the
finite clause, providing strong force for the utterance as a
whole. 4
9.4Participles and aspect markingApart from Punctual marking in participle-only imperative
utterances, participles can be marked for Punctual or Sequential aspect in non-imperative finite clauses, and for
Punctual aspect in imperative finite clauses. In all cases,
the aspect marked on the participle functions as aspect
marking for the clause as a whole. It is thus possible for
participles to be marked for aspect while the finite verb in
the clause is marked only for tense or mood; the converse
situation also occurs.
Aspect marking on participles isIn 9-36 particularly, the use of buy' 'do completely' has
an effect similar to the tag 'Okay?' following some English
imperatives, such as, for example, 'Just do it, okay?'. The
direct illocution here is of a question, although it has the
indirect illocution of reinforcing the command rather than
genuinely rsqcesting a response; any response at all ought
only to take the form of an agreement.","[275, 276]"
"Wagiman occur in Mangarayi, where the non-inflec.ting elements, described as 'particles', are free items and are not
attached phonologically or morphologically to their I auxiliary' (Merlan 1982:52). 4
Functional similarities between Mangarayi particles and
Wagiman participles are broad, but differences are also
clearly discernable, particularly in the lack of aspect
marking on Mangarayi particles, and the semantic dominance
of the particle in expressing the meaning of the verbal
construction (op. cit.:124),
Nevertheless, a simple 'particle + auxiliary' analysis is
essentially unsatisfactory for Wagiman because it fails to
take into account the fact that participles are quite distinct predicates in their ability to have individual object
and subject arguments; the transitivity of a clause can be
altered by the transitivity of the participle, and in
already transitive clauses, a further overt nominal argument
can be introduced into the clause (see 9.2.1; transitivity
has also been discussed in 6.2.1).
Moreover, the subject or.
agent of participles and the finite verb in a clause need
not be identical, as in switch subject and multiple object
constructions, while in some others (ambient constructions),
participles share no arguments at all with the finite verb
(again, see 9.2.1 above).
In a 'particle + aux' structure,
the particle is assumed to have the same arguments as the
aux, and the two are given effectively as a unit verbal
constituent; this is clearly not the case in Wagiman participle structures,
'* In the Pama-Nyungan language Warlpiri , spoken well to the
south of both Wagiman and Mangarayi, some 'adverbial preverbs' can also be separated from their 'main verb' , either
to a position directly following the verb instead of directly preceding it, or to sentence-final position (Nash 1982:
180-1).","[332, 333]"
"The count for Wagiman does not include roots which can
also occur as participles. It also counts meanings rather
than roots, and if another language has two verbs where
Wagiman has one with two meanings, or vice versa, then the
meaning is counted twice.i
:d,In this structure, any NP arguments must be reflected pronominally in the finite verb prefix. However, material described above indicates that arguments of participles are not
subcategorized by the finite verb at all; structures of the
type given in 11-48 are therefore inadequate. The problem
arises more clearly with examples that contain two object
arguments, where one belongs to the participle and the other
to the finite verb (as in 11-46 above).lagibangarradinlagiban garradin gal'ma

In fact, this particular problem touches upon the wider
problem of underlying structures which it is worth discussing here.
In many sentences which contain finite verbs,
actants in the clause do not occur expressed as overt nominals or pronouns, but have reference only in the verbal prefix. If it is assumed that phrase structures (or any other
type of basic structures) are composed of obligatory NP
slots which are cross-referenced onto the verb, then some
sort of reduction rule would have to apply to a majority of
clauses.
Such a rule is not improbable, but it has been
shown in other sections (cf. 7.1) that the pronominal function of prefixes is not necessarily cross-referencing.
Moreover, overt nominal reference to participants is often
used for presenting new information, or for other discoursestrategies (cf. 11.2 above); the unmarked
.,.
structure in numerical and discourse terms is to have no overt nominal reference and such a rule would therefore seem to be unmotivated.
Rather than considering a basic underlying sentence
structure to be one where NP slots are initially filled,
usually by pronouns, with mapped features in the finite verb
prefix (which, in any case is not always true, cf. examples
8-1 to 8-4), and which are then typically emptied again by
the application of some sort of deletion rule, it is more
economical and appropriate to propose that the reverse holds
true. In this case, underlying clause structure would have
slots in the verb prefix filled first, with an optional
restatement of the prefix as overt nominal arguments in
response to discourse requirements.
Such an approach to
languages similar in type to Wagiman has been discussed by
Jelinek (1985).
The implications for underlying structure description here
are that, in a simple sentence without a participle, rather
than having NP slots and a verb slot in a clause, S (sentence) would be rewritten only by V (ie. S
V), and the V
would contain slots for either one or two pronomin~lreferents, depending on lexically defined transitivity.
These
would be optionally expanded into full nominals (including
pronouns, in this case) only if required for pragmatic purposes.
Example 11-50 describes this in approximate terms
for a simple transitive sentence, in which the lsg item is
not expressed as an overt nominal (defined by Hale 1983:7 as
'null anaphora').","[340, 341, 342]"
"IHowever, such a classification is mechanical and coarse; it
fails to shed any light on the more subtle functional and
other, often semantic, differences that can be determined
within particular classes.
A broader description of word
classes would also be able to define sub-classes on linguistically relevant grounds. For example, the class of
Adverbs can be divided into sub-classes on the basis of
whether they code mood (negation, doubt) or other categories
(time, manner, position).
In this case the sub-classification is semantic.
Despite the use of functional and grammatical criteria for
the classification, names of word classes used here also
tend to reflect notional and traditional usage. Consequently, that class of words which includes those which express
actions, processes and states is called the class of
'verbs', although having this meaning is not a necessary
condition for inclusion in this class; it will be seen, for
example, that other syntactic and morphological criteria are
necessary to distinguish the class of verbs from the class
of 'participles'.
4.1NominalsNominals form an open class defined as those lexical items
which can carry case and other suffixes (described in Chapter 6 below), and which can occur in the central grammatical
roles of Agent, Patient and Subject. Nominals do not necessarily have to be able to occur with all nominal suffixes,
but the occurrence of one such'suffix on an item is sufficient to determine its status as a nominal. In notional
terms, most nominals describe the names of people, places
and real-world objects, and some would thus be called
'nouns' in traditional part-of-speech systems.",[105]
"1iThe bulk of the corpus used for the description is that
prov(.ded by Lulu Martin Dalpalngali and Douglas Jack Milguyarsi, mainly without translation prompts. The method used
here was to present the speaker with a topic word or sentence example, either in English or Wagiman, and to record
the ensuing discourse. This provided many good examples of
contextualized utterances and short texts of several clauses
in length. Neither of these two speakers tended to translate word for word, SO that the material gathered in this
manner is more reliable than that extracted from speakers
through translation prompts. One drawback, however, is that
it usually contains references to a small number of grammatical persons, because most sessions were with one speaker
only. Speakers generally also had a habit of perceiving a
discourse link between unconnected topic prompts, so that
many consecutively elicited utterances would be about the
same discourse topic, and would contain similarly-limited
numbers of verbs and participant references, despite attempts to extract other information.
One method of research found not to be particularly successful was providing speakers with sentences or forms in Wagiman in order to test their acceptability or grammaticality.
It was always difficult to be certain what was being agreed
to or rejected by individuals on these occasions, and there
were also cases where it was obvi'ous that speakers were
merely agreeing with what they thought I wanted to hear. In
others, it seemed that despite attempts to elicit grammaticality judgements, the speaker concentrated on pronunciation
only. For these reasons, unless a particular form or construction was actually produced, and not just agreed to in
response to a query, it has been considered to be of very
doubtful value.",[28]

'syntax' in Wagiman. Topics discussed are of language-specific as well as typological interest: NP structure, major
constituent order, non-finite equational clauses, finite
clause adjunction, the syntax. of participle constructions,
Oblique contrastive constructions, reduplication and a syntactic focus clitic.
11.1Noun Phrase structureThe constituent 'Noun Phrase' (NP) can be justified on the
basis that case marking suffixes normally occur on the final
element only of contiguous nominal members of an NP. Discontinuous NPs, where members are separated from each other
by some other lexical category, do not occur. Nominals
separated by other items in a clause are thus always members
of different NPs, although not all examples of contiguous
nominals need necessarily be members of the same NP. However, morphologically unmarked nominals having different NP
membership are rare (see 11.2 below), and are in any case
distinguished through context and intonation.
The following sections describe NP constituent order and
case marking respectively.
11.1.1NP constituent orderAn NP typically consists of two, and occasionally three,
nominals, one of which (the 'head') is semantically modified
by the other(s)
The relative order of the head and modifiers of NPs is not grammatically fixed, although some generalizations are possible.
Following Greenberg's (1963)
approach to the typology of language on the basis of the
order of sentence elements, modifiers of an NP head nominal
( N ) are categorized here into various classes: demonstratives (IDEM'), including all the deictics; adjectival.","[302, 303, 304, 305]"
"A major problem is found in a lack of evidence in the language for any 'basic word order', defined as that which holds

which represent Si, A and 0 in the verb or by clitics, it is
extremely rare for Wagiman sentences to contain free nominal
expressions of both A and 0, or even Si, providing little
evidence for statements about 'basic' order (op. cit.:129).",[312]

I11.5The syntax of participle constructionsAn earlier analysis of the syntax of participle clauses is
to be found in Cook (in press).
The current approach can be
considered a more comprehensive reformulation.
Participle constructions were described in functional and
structural terms in Chapter 9, and analogies were drawn
between them and serial verb constructions in other languages.
Serial verb constructions provide a likely source
historically for participles, and it is clear that there is
still some variation in the occurrence of particular words
as either participles or finite verbs (see 9.6 above).
However, other analyses are common in Australian languages,
particular those which fall under the general heading of
what can be called the 'auxiliary' approach.
115.1General considerationsWagiman finite verb participle constructions display some
structural similarities to multi-part predicate constructions in other languages in the region, in which one element
inflects for mood and/or tense and/or pronominal reference,
and the other is uninflected and perhaps not obligatory; in
many of these languages, the terms 'auxiliary' and '(main)
verb' or 'particle', or other terminological variants, are
used to describe the various elements.
Often, the 'particle' is not free, and is connected in some way to the 'auxiliary. Constructions relatively similar to those found inSee, for example, Reid 1982, Heath 1978a, 1980c, 1981,
Tryon 1974, 1976, Merlan 1982, and also other descriptions
in Dixon 1976:613-768.",[332]
"Some participles nearly always occur reduplicated, but a
simplex form, which might occur only very rarely, can also
be elicited for them. Others must be considered frozen
reduplications because they appear not to have a corresponding simplex form. Generally, reduplication for participles
is a productive process, in line with its behaviour in other

have the full range of suffixation and occur in the same
clause functions as simplex forms. There is usually no
change in lexical meaning for productively r-eduplicated
participles, but they have rather a more habitual or continuous aspectual sense, Some reduplicated forms do have meanings slightly extended from those of their simplex counterparts, however.
Figure 9-2 provides examples of typical
simplex and reduplicated participle forms.

1.4).
Reduplication creates a potentially non-final glottal
stop in the first syllable because the syllable boundary is
moved around the nasal: bs'na is syllabified as CV8$CV, but
the elision of the vowel -a in reduplication creates a syllable boundary after (rather than before) n.
bon'bona isthus syllabified as CVCV$CVV$CV, and the glottal stop metathesizes around the consonant to occur syllable-finally,
9.2Finite clause participle constructionsWhen they occur in a finite clause, one or two participles
can occur with only one finite verb. Similar constructions
in other Australian languages are oftenmlabelled 'auxiliary
constructions', in which the finite verb is called the 'auxiliary' and the non-finite item the 'main verb' or 'particle'.
Multiple-element verbal constructions are to be
found in a variety of languages in the area near where Wagiman was traditionally spoken, including Mangarayi (Merlan
1982), the Daly River languages generally (Tryon 1974, 1976,
Reid 1982, Green 1981), Ngandi (Heath 1978a), Warndarang
(Heath 1980c) and Mara (Heath 1981). Merlan (op. cit.:124)
reports that languages having these constructions occur in
an east-west belt stretching over much of northern Australia.
However, the term 'auxiliary construction' in the literature
actually covers a wide variety of constructions in which the
only common feature is that some item other than the 'main
verb' is used to carry information concerning tense. This
seems to be from Dixon (1972:15) who states that:
'There are languages in which information regarding
tense is shown, not by inflection of a verb but by
an additional 'auxiliary' element in the utterance. 'A wide variety of disparate constructions are thus somewhat
misleadingly grouped under the same heading, and include
those where the auxiliary can be considered to be, or to2Brief descriptions of such constructions in a number of
Australian languages are to be found in Dixon (1976:613768).
Almost all of them are presented in terms of 'auxiliary' plus 'particle', or a terminological variant.","[257, 258]"
"The 'afterwards' sense of dyumbany is illustrated in example
10-26 above. Other senses are as in the following examples:
10-29dyumbanyga-yuga'anmodoga-layigbehind3sg:IPFV-bethatcar-LOC[LMD 1851

10.1.9.2munya 'underneath', rolok 'on top'munya is quite straightforward in its use, and specifiesthat one object is located underneath another object; motion
under or downwards is expressed with the participle leka'descend1,and munya has been recorded only with static
locational meaning:

underga-yu
3sg:IPFV-bedupa modoga-layiq

car-LOC[LMD 1851'(The dog) is sitting under the motor car. '
Speakers did not freely produce examples of munya with a
verb of motion to mean that the motion was carried out within an area or location defined as being underneath something
else (for example, 'running around under the house'), and
were not happy with such test sentences provided in Wagiman.
All the examples of munya recorded have an interpretation of
static location, but this could reflect a variety of factors, including the difficulty of speakers in imagining
contexts for the relevant prompt sentences.
wolok appears to be antonymous with munya, and again occurs
only with the copula verbs (either yu-gin or n i - q i n ) or
to describe static location on top of something; movement
within the area defined as 'on top' was again not expressed
with volok, but the adverb gagga 'higher upq (cf. 10.1.9.4)
was often used with no overt location nominal in the sentence.","[296, 297]"

Three different finite verbs are used in these examples to
indicate different types of action. In example 9-13, with
the use of the finite verb bu-ni 'to hit, to kill', the
speaker is making explicit the statement that the human
patient of the action was struck with the stone. However,
the use of ra-ndi 'to move (something) with extended arm
action' in 9-14 merely indicates that the stone was thrown,
and no explicit predication is made that the human patient
was actually struck. A further utterance is used to make
the fact clear that the old man was hit. The use of bu-ni
implies that something is hit as a part of the verb's meaning, while ra-ndi merely indicates here that something was
moved in a particular way.
ra-ndi can have the unmarked
meaning of 'to spear1 without a pasticiple, given appropriate context, but not the meaning 'to throw' on its own;
there is no finite verb which has 'throw' as its 'basic'
lexical meaning. The finite verb re-na means explicitly 'to
spear', however, and can also be used as in 9-16.
The discourse or other factors which affect the alternation
between either a compound verb+participle construction or a
lexical finite verb with an apparently identical meaning,
are not currently fully understood. It can be presumed from
the above examples, and those following, that at least one
of the major factors is the illocutionary intent of the
speaker: whether the utterance is being used merely as a
description (where a single finite verb might be used), or
as some other sort of utterance, where a more complicated
illocution is intended.","[265, 266]"
"In switch-subject constructions, a transitive finite verb is
followed by the intransitive participle boda 'die', but the
finite verb still maintains two-place pronominal reference
in its prefix, and not the one-place prefix expected if the
argument of the intransitive participle were controlling the
finite verb:

argued in the following section that finite clause participle constructions are, in fact, the modern reflexes of
historical serial verb constructions which have evolved in a
different direction.
11.5.2Synchronic syntax of p a r t i c i p l e c o n s t r u c t i o n sIn 9.2 it was shown that participle constructions exhibit
many structural characteristics of serial verb constructions, but are nevertheless synchronically not such. However, evidence suggests that, historically, serialization of
finite verbs may have produced the class of participles as
modern frozen serialized elements.
Several points are of
relevance in such an analysis.
An important point is the variation between finite verb and
participle function for some items. Not all participles can
occur as finite verbs, but it would seem to be indicative of
a change in progress: either participles are moving towards
a finite verb function, or finite verbs are becoming partIf the latter is true, a corollary is that this
iciples.
process must be nearly completed.
Structurally, participles exhibit features typical of serial
verbs, including a limited ability to occur in switch-subject, multiple-object and ambient constructions. Semantically, serial verb constructions can be considered as an
interface between syntax and lexicon in that the meaning of
various types of construction is fixed lexically, despite
their productive nature in other ways (cf. Pawley 1980).
Ambient and switch-subject constructions fall into this
category: it is not possible to predict from the syntax whyM
Ithe object of the finite verb is the subject of the participle in a switch-subject construction (see examples 9-4 to
9-6), nor why ambient constructions do not have a more literal meaning, where the subject of the finite verb is also
the subject of the participle (see example 9-8).
Related to their structure, participles also vary in their
relative transitivity, and can have arguments different from
the finite verb, indicating the linking of separate predicates to form compound meanings as in serialization.
Several different sources can be proposed for modern participles within this approach:
(i)
Some participles were probably originally
monomorphemic finite verbs.
These would seem to have been
the participles in classes (iiia) and (iiib) in Figure 9-1
which are polysyllabic and end with a voiceless stop and the
vowel a .
Some of these participles can still occur as
finite verbs under particular circumstances (duduta(-yi) 'to
run' and guka(-yi) 'to sleep', for example). Others cannot,
although the synchronic triggers for the variation are not
known.
(ii)
Some participles may originally have been
adverbials or even other monomorphemic finite verbs compounded with another finite verb to form a polymorphemic verb
stem. The participles in classes (i) and (ii) in Figure 9-1
which are followed by a glottal stop and contain a final
syllable form of -ma, -na, or -ga are candidates here.
Significantly, -ma is homophonous with the finite verb ma-yi
'to get', a likely root for transitive compounding. In
Mangarayi, the form -ma currently occurs in compound constructions as an 'auxiliary' with other roots unable to occur
alone, and also as a main verb where it occurs with free
'particles' (Merlan 1982:129-30).
-na is also homophonous
with the Wagiman verb root na-ni 'to become', also a likely
inchoative compounding root.
Modern Wagiman participlesfollowed by -ga could be the result of either the compounding of another verb which has no modern form, or the result
of phonological changes over time, due perhaps to the preceding vowel or word-initial consonants. Only gaP1ma from
this group has been recorded as a finite verb.
(iii)
The participles in class (iv) which end in a
form homophonous with the finite verb yalan 'to say, to do'could also be the result of compounding with that verb, in
order to create a finite, perhaps causative, verb form (cf.
section 9.6). Some items in this class can also function as
modern finite verbs without -pavan, such as belka-yi 'to
roast, to cook'. Some others are also the result of synchronically transparent compounding (cf. guka 'sleep' and
gukayalan 'camp out').
Serial verb constructions would probably then have used
these derived or monomorphemic verbs by stringing them together in a sentence, linked by' common mood and tense
values, and perhaps other factors. Particular verbs could
also have retained their own arguments, giving rise to
multiple object and switch subject constructions.
It is
likely that one verb would have retained marking for tense,
mood and pronominal reference, and others in the series
would have remained unmarked.
For verb stems based on a
compound with -ma and ya1an, the unmarked root form of the
finite verb would have been used. However, it does not seem
unlikely that some constructions would have tended to become
lexicalized, and particular roots and stems would then have
tended to occur more often as either serial form verbs or
inflected finite verbs in relatively fixed constructions.
The current finite verbs all have meanings which fall in the
area of central vocabulary, such as 'come', 'go' 'ingest',
'spear', 'fall' and so on. A comparison with the verb roots
in the Pama-Nyungan languages Gurindji, Walmatjari, Jaru,
Warlmanpa and Warlpiri (usefully provided in Nash 1982 from
various sources) and also the Indo-European language Hindi
(also in Nash 1982, from data in Hook 1974:19-20, 119-20)'Zillustrates the point that in these languages, which all
have relatively few finite roots, approximately half the
meanings also occur coded as finite verbs in Wagiman. Verbs
with these meanings are likely to form the finite basis for
serial constructions because they describe commonly undertaken activities which can then be more explicitly described
in serialized form.
The comparisons are given in Figure
11-70

).","[336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"
"attempts to elicit further examples later were not successful, for what appeared to be contextual reasons. At some
stage the addition of -yaman might have been a productive
process for the creation of participles from some other word
class, or for the creation of causative forms from other
participles, but this is not attested. It should be recalled that ya'an as a finite verb means ' to tell' or ' to do' ,
with a causative implication. gukaya'an 'camp out' can be
thus considered a derived causative form of guka 'sleep', in
which the addition of -ya8an expresses the causativity.
The translations provided by speakers for the rare occurrences of other -ya'an alternants (one each for yu'naya'an
and gurr'maya'an) did not indicate any apparent causative
meaning for them, although such an interpretation did not
seem impossible in their context. Both words were recorded
in unelicited speech. The root forms of each function occur
commonly without -yaman as class (ii) and (i) participles
respectively, supporting the hypothesis that its addition
may, at least in the past, have been a more productive process. This question is discussed more fully in 11.5.2
below.
In summary, all participles are two or more syllables in
length and finish with the vowel /a/. Reduplication is
possible, both of the unmarked participle as a whole or the
root form only, with aspectual or other slight meaning
changes.
As illustrated in Figure 9-1, Punctual participle forms are
derived from the unmarked form by reduction of the final
syllable in some way. In class (ii) and (iiia), the final
vowel is elided; for class (i) and (iiib), the entire final
-ma syllable is elided; no Punctual forms were recorded for
Case marking and the Sequential
class (iv) participles.
aspect suffix occur attached to the unmarked, citation form
directly. Aspect and case marking are discussed in 9.4 and
9.5 below.","[255, 256]"
"IHowever, the Desiderative prefix is restricted to use only
on verbs which have a lsg nominal marked in the prefix.
A further resultant restriction of meaning is thus to aspectually unmarked Indicative mood, because of the aspect contrast neutralization for lsg forms. The above examples show
that the lsg nominal can be in any grammatical function in
both transitive and intransitive finite verbs. The restriction to lsg reference is presumably due to a grammaticalized
pragmatic restraint, whereby speakers are unable to state
another person's intention unless they are closely involved
in the action. Such close involvement apparently means
being either S, A or 0 in grammatical terms, and participants in some way in semantic terms.
Because it is not possible to use the Desiderative prefix
for clauses which have no 1st person reference involved in
them, there is a potential gap in possibility of expression
in this area.
However, the use of iterative aspect (see
7.2.4.3) with the adverb gorro 'later, tried (but failed)'
provides an interpretation of 'attempt' or 'intend' when
there is no lsg nominal marked in the prefix.
7e2e3'Finite imperative utterancesFinite verb imperative utterances are not marked in any way
morphologically, and are formally identical with 2sg or 2pl
prefixed declarative finite verbs. The distinction between
imperatives and other utterance types is based on intonation and context: imperatives are uttered with relatively
more loudness and pitch.
The Immediate future suffix can
occur on verbs used as imperatives to indicate the speaker's
desire that the action be undertaken at once. A second type
of imperative, discussed in 9.3, can be formed with only a
participle and no finite verb or nominal arguments.",[195]
"1
IIndefinite nominals are not marked with any demonstrative,
although there is a possible interpretation of definiteness
available for nominals without any demonstrative, again
depending on context.

5.4.1.4dyaman [Anaphoric]:thatThe use of dya'an as an anaphoric demonstrative is perhaps
less well recorded than the deictic demonstratives. Itoccurs most commonly in textual and other unelicited material, and only rarely in elicited examples. The common contexts for its use are situations of unstructured conversation, and in utterances which have enough preceding context
to permit discourse anaphora.
The more formal linguistic
contexts in which speakers often provided data reduced its
occurrence.
dya'an is more commonly used as an interrogative or indefinite nominal meaning 'what' or 'which' (see 10.3.2).
Its
demonstrative and interrogative uses seem to be linked semantically in the same way that 'what' can be used both as an
interrogative particle and a relative pronoun in English.
In Wagiman the anaphoric use of dya1an to modify a nominal
in an NP signals that the speaker is referring to an item
assumed to be known by the hearer, for example, 'the man
that (I referred to before)'. Once an item has been specified using one of the three deictic demonstratives, it is
then possible to refer to it later in a discourse with the
anaphoric demonstrative. In a text or discourse placed in
the past, the usual first reference to a participant is with
ga'an, and subsequent reference can be with-dya'an.
When
dya'an is used without any preceding context, it marks its
referent as being one which the speaker presumes the hearer
already understands as having a given reference.
dyalan has no distance features associated with it, and is
glossed as 'anaphora' (ANAPH).
The following examples are given with context. Example 5-44
has no recorded linguistic context, but an outline of the
circumstances of its utterance is given.
Although brief, 5-44 is typical. It was recorded as a response to a question concerning who was not going to a particular meeting in town because of a lack of space in the
car, and the old man referred to was already sitting waiting
nearby.
Speakers knew from this fact, and the fact thatII117there had been some considerable previous discussion, who
was being referred to.

There is very little preceding discourse context for 5-45.
It seems to have been prompted by the preceding utterance
(also given in the example, and also unelicited) which provided the reference to spears with some relevance. The type
of shovel spears referred to were standing in a corner of
the speaker's house, in the process of being made.

6.4Number marking nominal suffixesThe Pair, Plural and Inclusive suffixes given in figure 7-3
above can be used on finite verbs, as well as on nominals,where their have a similar function: they mark one of the
referents of the pronominal prefix as having the semantic
value carried by the particular suffix.
Such bi-valency
should not be seen as unusual in a language in which information concerning the actants in a clause is often carried
only by the prefix, and in which free nominals are not req.uired syntactically.
In order to avoid duplication of description, the finite
verb use of these suffixes will be described here, rather
than in Chapter 7 on finite verb affixing morphology. When
they occur on finite verbs, number suffixes are usually the
last item following tense and aspect suffixes; if there are
none, they directly follow the root.
6.4.1Pair suffixes -giwu, -gudyuThere are two synonymous forms of the Pair suffix, both of
which seem to be used by all speakers.
Both forms are used
to mark nominals as either being one member of a pair, or as
actually consisting of a pair. In the latter function they
can effectively be dual number markers, but their use also
goes beyond this.
The following two examples were recorded in the same session
with Douglas Jack Milguyarri, and illustrate the apparent
synonomy of these suffixes:
6-96labali-gndyu maf-gin
leg-PAIR
this-PAIR[DJM 4841'These are two legs,'9There is some variation of'use amongst.speakers, however.
Douglas Jack Milguyarri and his sister Lulu martin Dalpalngali use -gudyu suffixed to nominals more than do Don Liddy
Balambal and the Huddleston family in Pine Creek. -gudyu,
for example, was recorded only once from Don Liddy Balambal,
suffixed to a verb rather than a nominal,6-97[DJM 4841mae-giru, mae-gudyu labali
this-PAIR this-PAIR leg
'These are two legs.'6-98 is also typical of dual number marking function; such
examples can just as easily be translated as 'that pair',
however, preserving the 'pair' meaning:

'Those two hit the dog. '1These suffixes are also used to form second person dual
forms from 2pl Base pronouns, and can also mark lpl Base
pronouns in the same way, notwithstanding the existence
The following
already of separate ldu forms (cf. 5.1).
examples were elicited from English sentences (as is apparent from their similar and rather unnatural English translations).
Overt free pronouns would not normally occur in
this way; usually only the finite verb would be marked,
either with the ldu prefix or, for 2du, with the Pair suffix
only :
6-99gego-gin
1pZ-PAIRgin-bu-n
1du:IPFV-hit-PRESgaean lamarra

dog'We two are hitting that dog. I

2pl-PAIRgityiya mu-bu-gim
today
2pl:POT-hit-PAIRlmarra
dog[DLB 831ga @ an
that'You two will hit that dog today.'
In virtually all elicited examples where the speaker was
asked for translations of English dual number, a Pair-marked
free pronoun occurs with a similarly marked finite verb, in
what seem to be sentences which unduly emphasise the dualnumber marking in Wagiman. This merely represents, in fact,
speakers' attempts to translate what they saw as an artificially emphasised feature of the English source sentences.
The problem with such examples is that they are produced
completely out of context, and could only be produced naturally in a quite different setting.
It is also possible to mark one of two non-identical free
nominals in a clause as being a pair in some way. In example 6-101, the old man and old woman make up a pair because
they were alone together at the time of the example, but
also because they are a married couple of long standing and
are well known as always being together. This example is
extracted from a short text by Paddy Huddleston Benbo, and
also contains a Pair suffix attached to the finite verb:
6-101qalmatiwa
old womanmaluga-gin
old man-PAIRba-di-nya-giwu
3pl:PFV-come-PAST-PAIRwil'ma
walk[PHB 831'The old man and woman walked along.'
When they occur on an intransitive verb and do not reflect
any overt nominal in the clause, these suffixes express dual
number marking for the subject, as in example 6-101 above
and the following examples:
6-102gi-ya-giru
1pl:IPFV-go-PAIRril'ma
walkdnbay
downbora-ga
river-ALL[DLB 831
'We are walking down to the river.'
6-103mu-ya-gudyu
2pl:POT-go-PAIR[DJM 7841'You two fellows are going.'
Another function of the Pair suffixes is to express a ldu
exclusive meaning, when the addressee of the utterance is
not included in the pronominal reference of a first personnon-singular prefix.
These constructions contain a Pairsuffixed nominal in the clause to indicate that the ldu or
lpl prefix includes that particular nominal and the speaker,
but not the addressee:
6-104mabityparanqi-yu-qinlong time1pl:PFV-be-PASTQueenie-giwu-maga'anlra'anQueenie-PAIR-FOCthatplacega '-ba
there-PER[LMD 1;21]'We spent a long time at that place, Queenie and
I.'
The Pair suffixes can also be used on transitive verbs,
where they can refer to either Agent or Patient of the verb.
As with the intransitive exclusive example above, a Pairmarked nominal in the clause indicates either exclusive or
inclusive status and, if necessary, the grammatical function
of the referent of the Pair suffix on the verb. Such examples are rare, and the following exchange from an elicitation session in 1985 with Lulu Martin Dalpalngali is given as
containing the only examples of this, other than that from
the text given above. Prompts given by the researcher are
prefixed by AC, and Lulu Martin Dalpalngali's replies are
prefixed with LMD. While the prompts are in Wagiman and @re
not contradicted by the speaker, they should not be taken as
necessarily acceptable; in these examples they do not seem
to be unacceptable, however.

with the form ga to mean 'do not want (to do)'.

The tag form gale occurs commonly in final position in
questions, and, uttered with a rising intonation contour,
has the effect of requesting confirmation of the fact of the
question by the addressee. Few examples occurred in recording sessions because speakers tended not to ask questions
themselves. A typical example occurred in the question
(often addressed to me by speakers at Rybrook Farm) 'The
others have gone to get food, haven't they?', the point of
which was to ask politely whether they could get a ride into
town or not. A reply 'no' or 'not yet' would then be followed by a request for a lift as well:10-41ba-ya-ggi

TAG'They have all gone to get food, haven't they?'
gale is also able to occur alone in response to statements

"In 1986, I commenced work as a lecturer in linguistics at
the School of Australian Linguistics in Batchelor, situated
very approximately halfway between Pine Creek and Darwin.
Despite this apparently ideal position for the collection of
data, it has been difficult to complete more fieldwork.
Pressure of work has been one reason, but also because of
social difficulties in Pine Creek (discussed in 0.5.2 below)
and the problem of getting to Douglas Station in the wet
season (from December until March).
Another problem has
been a difficulty in tracing Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, who is
the best language informant, but who, following the death of
her lifelong friend and companion (an elderly Jawony woman,
and also a speaker of Wagiman), moved away from her usual
residence and cannot be traced.
Methods of collecting data varied as the research advanced,
and also with speakers; some speakers needed little prompting, while others had to be provided with quite clear source
material, usually in English, before they would produce
utterances or material in Wagiman. Most language sessions
after 1983 were tape recorded; some in 1983 were recorded,
but others transcribed verbatim, as speakers were distracted
by the presence of the tape recordere Direct translations
of English sentence prompts have been treated with some misgivings, depending on their complexity and the linguistic
point they are designed to illustrate, as well as some
doubtful examples from 1983 which were not tape-recorded;
these were often used in later research as a means of eliciting case forms or other morphology. Throughout the description, where a direct translation from English is given
as an example, its status as such is mentioned. The problems with these examples are usually contextual, and while
most elicited examples provided can be considered fully
'grammatical', they can appear somewhat unnatural. None of
the speakers I worked with could be persuaded to provide
traditional texts or stories, and rarely even longer nontraditional material, although George Huddleston Yalkpayarri
would occasionally narrate what might have been traditional
material in Kriol; it was, however, not easy to comprehend
*him when he spoke this language.
After much difficulty,
some longer narrative texts were recorded in 1984 and 1985,
and these appear in the Appendix. They effectively comprise
all of the longer narrative material available.","[26, 27, 28]"
"Chapter 9Participle c=onstructionsMany languages spoken in the northern part of Australia have
clausal structures which involve more than one verbal element.
In Wagiman, these structures typically comprise a
finite verb and one or more members of a distinct lexical
class of words called participles. However, participles can
also occur alone in some types of imperative utterances, as
well as functioning as nominal complements to an entire
clause.
Their status in the language seems to be unique
among other languages of the area, and indeed also in Australia.
Participles thus have a somewhat ambiguous syntactic role in
Wagiman, with both verb-like and nominal-like features. The
name 'participle' itself could be slightly misleading, inasmuch as these are not de-verbal, derived forms, as might
seem to be implied by the term, but are an open and distinct
class of lexical items. It is used, however, because members of the class have various syntactic and semantic features of both verbs and nominals.
Participles can be considered to have three major, clearly
distinguishable, syntactic functions:
(i)
they occur in finite clauses and productively
combine with the finite verb to express unique lexical predicate meanings;
(ii)
they occur in post- or pre-clausal position
suffixed with a Dative, Allative or Ablative case marker,
where they express Purposive, Intentional and Causative
complements respectively; and
(iii)
they occur alone without nominal arguments as
imperative utterances.
In functions (i) and (iii) they behave much like finite
verbs in that they express fundamentally verb-like meaningsand are part of the expression of the verbal predication of
the clause. In function (ii) they are more like nominals,
and can be directly substituted for by other nominals (cf.
However, while they appear to be
Chapter 6 generally).
semantically verbal in imperative function (iii), these
constructions are negated by the nominal Privative suffix
-ne8en (cf. 6.3.2), illustrating further the dual properties
exhibited by the word class.
Participles express a wide variety of meanings that include
both actions and states, such as 'run', 'sleep', 'camp out',
'look for', 'return' and 'strike'. They also express meanings that have the qualities of active adjectives where they
occur with a copula verb, such as '(be) quiet', '(be) sated'
and ' (be) sick'
In some cases it is difficult to separate
adjective-like meanings from verb-like meanings, and guka
'sleep1, for example, can be interpreted either as '(be)
asleep' or '(be) sleeping'
A small number of other participles have a type of 'locational preposition' meaning, for
example rerr'ma '(be) outside' and lema '(be) inside', and
these participles can also be used with finite verbs of
motion to express the meanings 'to exit' and 'to enter'
respectively.","[250, 251, 252]"
"You go and I will follow youdyapan 'slowly' and gabana 'quickly'These two adverbs simply specify the relative speed of an
action or activity. Both can be used alone as interjections, or with participle imperatives. A typical example of
the use of gabana occurs in 10-17 above. dyapan is used as
follows:

10.1.9Positional adverbsThe positional adverbs are 'non-deictic locating expressions' (after Fillmore 1982:43), which specify the position
of a nominal or noun phrase in respect of another nominal or
other contextually understood item.
Nominals modified by
adverbs in this way are marked with the Locative or Pergressive case suffixes.
Not all the positional adverbs have
been recorded with both movement and static position verbs,
however, and while forms meaning 'in front', 'behind' and
'around' occurred freely, no word meaning 'between' was
recorded either. It is not clear whether the idea of 'between' is expressed in some other fashion, or merely that it
is a gap in the collected corpus of adverbs.

"IWhile there is only a small number of actual speakern, a
larger number of individuals identify themselves as being
'Wagiman' people. The name 'Wagiman', however, is primarily
a language name, and individuals identify with the language,
not on the basis of their use of it, but on the basis of
their ownership of it. Thus the term 'language owning
group' is used to define those individuals who identify
themselves with the language name, irrespective of whether
they actually speak the language (Chase and Meehan 1983:
8-9).
The terms 'Wagiman people' and 'Wagiman language
owning group' are used interchangeably here, but contrast
with 'Wagiman speakers'. Like speakers, members of the
language owning group are still relatively few in number:
there are perhaps 40 individuals who would claim identification with the group, and many are young children or young
adults. Most live in Pine Creek, while some non-speakers,
other than Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, live in Darwin. Many
members of the language owning group belong to the extended
Huddleston family of Pine Creek, of which there are current-0.3Language teachers ('informants*)Several Wagiman people provided material for this description. Early data was given by Don Liddy Balambal, Paddy
Huddleston Benbo and his father George Huddleston Yalkpayarri, mainly in the form of simple sentences and lexical
items. They also provided many of the later research leads
through examples of the basic morphology as well.
Paddy
Huddleston Benbo is a relatively young speaker of the language (perhaps no older than 50), and was often not sure of
some words or constructions. He referred these cases to his
mother, Dolly Huddleston Wudyinma, for help; through personal observation, Wudyinma seems to be the best speaker of
Wagiman alive today, although she was never interested in
teaching the language. She was quite content, however, to
be the arbiter of any disputes or problems which arose in
the course of the work, and all considered her to be the
expert on the language and culture. The narrative text she
provided (Text DHW 1 in Appendix 1) was an exception to her
normal reticence; on the other hand, her husband Yalkpayarri
was an enthusiastic and interested participant, although his
lack of teeth, poor English and some interference from other
languages in the area made data from him difficult to understand, and often unreliable. Both Yalkpayarri and Wudyinma
are old, perhaps in their mid-seventies , while Yalkpayarri
is almost blind and often incapacitated by illness.
In 1984, several productive sessions were recorded with
Douglas Jack Milguyarri at Douglas Station. He has lived
and worked most of his life there in order to be near his
traditional land at dyuwalun (Douglas Hot Water Springs).
He is perhaps about 60 years of age. His control of some
traditional vocabulary (mainly flora terms) is not always
complete, although he is a fluent speaker in other ways.
Much of the more complex materisl and many freely produced
utterances were also recorded from Lulu Martin Dalpalngali,
his younger sister in Darwin. Lulu was an excellent informant, and'had a wealth of knowledge of traditional culture; a

Iisessions in 1985. Lulu is also unwell, however, and despite
her enthusiasm, found long sessions extremely taxing.
Small amounts of material were recorded from Max 'Banjo'
Banderson Idyindin of Adelaide River and his half brother
'Jindare' George Allen Mundeng, who died in 1984. 1
Generally, however, there were great difficulties in getting
speakers to provide any material at all. Some, such as
Dolly Huddleston Wudyinma, were never particularly interested, while for most others, such as Don Liddy Balambal, the
researcher was an initial object of curiosity, but soon
became too taxing. Age was also a problem, and relatively
young individuals, such as Paddy Huddleston Benbo, were
found eventually not to be adequate speakers for the complexity of language being sought; on the other hand, his
father George Yalkpayarri was quite simply incomprehensible
to a non-speaker of 'heavy' Kriol.
It is also probably true that all the speakers of Wagiman in
Pine Creek had alcohol problems at the time of the research,
making them often difficult to find, or to rely on to work
at any previously arranged time. On returning to Pine Creek
in 1984, a period of more than two months passed without any
significant language material having been recorded, and it
became clear that other speakers would have to be found.
Following what could be considered the exhaustion of the
linguistic resources there that year, I was able to continueIt is common in Australian Aboriginal culture for the
names of deceased people to be proscribed for a certain
period, during which time close relatives and, to a lesser
extent, other people do not utter the name or any word which
sounds like it.
Wagiman people do not currently seem to
have any strong restrictions on repeating the names of recently deceased people, although there is occasionally some
hesitation for Mundeng. On this basis I will provide names
of deceased Wagiman people in the text where relevant. However, readers should take note that tact and care must be
used if referring to these people in front of their relatives and frienos, or in publications or written material ofthe research with Douglas Jack Milguyarri and Lulu ldartin
Dalpalngali, who were quite felicitously interested and
willing to teach the language.
Fieldwork and fieldwork methodsThis description is the result of several field trips to
work with speakers of Wagiman living in the 'Top Endi area
of the Northern Territory, primarily during the dry winter
season between March and August, over the period 1983-85.
My first trip, from May to August in 1983, did not yield a
great deal of linguistic material, but primarily enabled the
development of personal contacts with speakers. Basic grammatical data and a relatively short list of lexical items
were also collected. In 1984 I spent six months in the
field, in an attempt, with varying success, to gather more
complex material and texts.
I also acquired a four-wheel
drive vehicle to go on bush trips with speakers in order to
facilitate the process. In June and July of the following
year, I collected what was effectively the last material for
the description, and managed to complete pronoun and prefix
paradigms which were still incomplete, and generally to
follow up as many of the leads indicated by the earlier
research as possible.
Most of the fieldwork period in 1983 and 1984 was spent in
the small township of Pine Creek, situated approximately 220
km south-east of Darwin on the Stuart Highway, the sole road
Between
south from Darwin to Alice Springs (see map 2).
five and six speakers of Wagiman were living there at that
time.
Some time was also spent in Darwin itself, working
with Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, who lived nearby, and also at
Douglas Station (approximately 170 km south-east of Darwin)
where Douglas Jack Milguyarri lived. The two months fieldwork in 1985 were spent entirely in Darwin, working with
Lulu Dalpalngali. When not staying in Pine Creek I lived in
a tent, which created some problems in organizing field
sessions, forward planning and so on.","[23, 24, 25, 26]"
"+[DJM 4841IThe Oblique in 5-32 could be analysed as an Allative complement of the finite verb ma(-yi) ' to get' , but it is never
otherwise an intransitive verb.
It is possible that the
participle nqaynaqay requires an oblique, rather than a direct, object complement and the Oblique pronoun is an argument of the participle; most other participles are either
strictly transitive or intransitive, however (see 11.5).fThe use of an Oblique in 5-32 does seem to be linked to
transitivity, where an Oblique object codes reduced impingement on the patient.
Certainly, in that example there is
very little direct impingement on the object of the waving,
and such an analysis seems reasonable in isolation. The
other examples still remain more problematic from this point
of view because of their varying degrees of transitivity and
the lack of correspondence between apparent impingement and
the pronoun object used. These examples must currently be
considered beyond explanation,
5.4Demonstratives and spatial deixisThree of the four demonstratives and several other nominals
and adverbs have 'spatial deixis' functions, defined by
Fillmore (1982:37) as:
'that aspect of deixis which involves referring to
the locations in space of the communication act
participants; it is that part of spatial semantics
which takes the bodies of the communication act
participants as significant reference objects for
spatial specification.'
Excluded from the definition is the set of location words
that take as their reference point some object other than
the speaker or hearer. These are non-deictic adverbial
'locating expressions' (op, cit.:43) and are treated separately below in 10.1.
Also excluded is the demonstrative
dyaean 'that1 which has discourse anaphoric value only, but
which is described in the current section. The deicticdemonstratives themselves can also have discourse anaphoric
functions, in which they do not express spatial relationships.
The demonstratives have two primary syntactic functions:
they are used as third person free pronuns, where they refer
to people, locations or objects in the real world; and they
are used as demonstrative modifiers of another full nominal.
The demonstrative ga8,an 'that, there' can also be used as a
definite article in its demonstrative function. They are
paradigmatically identical with other nominals, and can be
marked with various suffixes, including locational cases.

IIA three-way distance contrast is specified by the spatial
deictics, based on relative distance from the speaker (the
distance category terms in Figure 5-4 are from Fillmore
1982).
The categories [Proximal], [Medial] .and [Distal]
are based on relative distance from the speaker, which Fillmore (op. cit.:48) describes as 'speaker pivot', where the
distance referred to by the deictic is based on that from
the speaker. A second possible type of pivot for deictic
systems is 'hearer pivot' where distances are based on those
from the hearer.
In the following sections, the deictics
are defined in terms of their 'pivot' and distance category.
5,4,1Demonstratives5.4,1,1ma'an[Proximal]:'here, this, this onemma'an is used-to refer to items which are relatively close
to the speaker and which are in both the speaker and hearer's field of view. Items referred to with ma'an are also
interpreted as being specific, presumably as a result of the
requirement that they be in the visual field at the time of
the utterance, for example:
5-33la 'an man.an paniggin

"-The pronominal reference would be-affected by phonological
and lexical rules to produce the portmanteau form qan-, andSimilar proposals relating to 'predicators' in Warlpiri
corresponding approximately to the category 'verb' in tradtional grammar) have been made by Hale (1983), in which the
'lexical structure' of a predicator specifies the number of
arguments it can take, although none need necessarily appear
as overt nominals in phrase structure.",[342]
"The mood prefix' used for finite imperatives can be either
Imperfective or Potential, depending on the speaker's view
of the relative potentiality or factuality of the action
being described. Actions described or predicated in an
imperative utterance which are considered possible only are
expressed with the Potential prefixes, while those that are
considered real are expressed with the Imperfective, for
example :
7-18buy 'mi-ga-dyado completely-PCT[DJM 48412sg:POT-take-IMM'You take it! '
7-19dyambagi-yaIRR NEG2sg:IPFV-go mess aroundmi-p

7-21dyapanmi-raga'anganin,bakslowly2sg:POT-throwthatspearbreak-PCTgi-ra
2sg:IPFV-throw[DJM 2841'Throw the spear steadily, or you will break it.'
The alternation between Imperfective and Potential mood for
the prefixes on the two finite verbs in 7-19 reflects the
speaker's view of the relative reality of the events being
described : the addressee in the first clause was actualj-y
messing around at the time of the utterance, and the command
to stop is in the indicative Imperfective to reflect this;
in the next clause, where there is a command to be quiet,
the predicated state of being quiet was only a potential
fact, and is therefore in the Potential mood.
Examples
7-20 and 7-21 also illustrate the way mood choice reflects
the speaker's view of reality, and that this can vary forparticular clauses in a discourse. The Potential mood is
used in 7-20 to indicate the speaker's belief, clear from
discourse context and the real-world situation, that the
addressee has not yet gone away, and that this is still a
potential fact only. In 7-21, the speaker is exhorting the
addressee to throw the spear steadily and the verb is marked
for Potential mood because the act of throwing steadily has
not actually occurred, and is also still only a potential
fact.
However, following the command to be careful, the
next statement, that the spear will break, is marked with
the Indicative imperfective in spite of the fact that it is
not an objectively real fact: the spear has not yet broken.
The switch of mood here indicates that, as far as the speaker is concerned, the spear is certain to break if it is not
thrown steadily, and the utterance is coded in the indicative to reflect this.
The relationship between the real world and the mood used is
only ever accidental, i'n the sense that the use of the Potential for potential activities and the indicative Imperfective for factual situations merely reflects a tendency for
speakers' views to correspond to what could be called 'objective reality', In fact, mood always corresponds to 'subjective reality' , or the world as the speaker sees it ; the
two worlds will thus tend, but not always, to correspond.
Mood is therefore precisely the 'speaker's commitment with
respect to 'the factual status of what he is saying' (Lyons
1968:307), where this is defined by the speaker at the time.
7.2.4Verb t e n s e and aspect s u f f i x e sThe tense and aspect suffixes are used to give unambiguous
tense and aspect values to finite verbs, which, as has been
shown, do not necessarily need them in order to express a
limited number of time contrasts. When they are used, however, a precise and detailed description is made of how and
when an action or activity occurred, rather than a relatively vague statement only. The inventory of these suffixes is
given in Figure 7-3.","[195, 196, 197]"
"A further difficulty for the predictive status of word order
typology is that it relies heavily on the presence of adpositions (prepositions or postpositions), particularly in
regard to the order of NP constituents. An entirely affixing language such as Wagiman is thus irrelevant to many
generalizations concerning sentence order (Comrie 1981:85).
The generalizations made of NP order above fall into this
category, and can have no predictive value within the typology for the rest of the language.
The constituent 'Vf is also somewhat problematic in Wagiman,
where what can be considered the 'verb' can be expressed by
more than one item; the predicate of a clause can comprise a
finite verb and one or two participles which can have their
own object arguments and ordering possibilities (cf. 9.2.1).
Nevertheless, an examination of the texts in the Appendix
reveals that some, albeit weak, generalizations about constituent order are possible.
The texts were chosen as the
corpus for this analysis because of their relative.independence from English influence on order. They display a strong
freedom of constituent order, and 59 different sentence
(order) types occur. Constituents counted were: A (Agent),0 (Object), Si (Intransitive subject), V (Verb), P (Parti-ciple), Obl (Oblique nominal) Inst (Instrumental) and X (any
other item, such as adverbs, locatives or directionals).
Of 256 sentences which contained a finite verb, exactly half
(128) contained one or more core case NPs (Oblique objects
or complements of intransitive verbs are also counted in
this group), and the remainder (again 128) occurred with
core roles represented only in the finite verb prefix; these
sentences generally also contained at least one other item
as well.
Remarkably, only 6 sentences actually contained
both A and 0, while 6 also contained Si and Obl (an Oblique
object complement of some sort) or Si and an Absolutive
complement.
Despite the potential freedom of order for participles relative to verbs, the texts revealed a tendency for them to
occur directly before the finite verb (56 examples), although they also occurred following it (18 examples), with
three examples recorded where some other item occurred betThe most
ween V and P (XVSiPX, XVXP and XVPXPX order).
common PV order was, in fact, PV, while the most common VP
order was XVP. The data in Figure 11-3 summarizes the
recorded orders (constituents in parentheses, such as (OP),
indicate that the 0 is an argument of the Participle, not
the finite verb or the predicate as a whole).
Because of the consistent link between V and P, their occurrence together was counted as a single 'V' for the purposes
of order relative to other constituents, simplifying the
variety of clause order types significantly.
In the 12 sentences with two nominal participants (including
free pronouns), no strong order tendencies were found. Only
one of the 12 sentences also contained any other material
apart from the 'V' and the core NPs. 'SiXVO1 in Figure 11-4
represents a copula construction with an Absolutive complement described as '0' for ordering purposes.","[312, 313]"

"There is no trace of any.special avoidance language for use
with certain kinship relations, although Don Liddy Balambal
did once describe in Kriol old behavioural codes required in
the presence of one's mother-in-lzw.
These are no longer
adhered to, although some reservation on the part of older
people remains in behaviour towards, or in front of, classificatory in-law kin relations.
Douglas Jack Milguyarri, Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, Max Banderson Idyindin and the late George Allen Mundeng all have
ritual and historical associations with country in the east
and north-east of the traditional land, while the Huddleston
family and Don Liddy Balambal tend to associate more with
the western area around goloy (Collah water 'hole).
Some
linguistic differences occur, based on this division, but
they are minor. The most obvious is variation in the use of
ni-gin and yu-pin as copula verbs, described in 8.2.3, and
the,use of the pair suffix - g i n , described in 6.4.1. Occasionally speakers would also spontaneously provide a synonym for a particular lexical item. An example here is the
word for 'knee', typically given as bondedi, but occasionally in elicitation sessions the form dyatya would be provided consciously as an alternant. No source or reason for
the alternant was able to be given, merely that it was also
a Wagiman word,
Other variation has origins more difficult to determine.
Douglas Jack Milguyarri consistently pronounced the word
gityiya 'tomorrow' as dyityiya. Whether this is a genuine
variant or merely the result of Milguyarri's isolation for
such a long time at Douglas Station is not clear. Other
speakers did not indicate any disapproval of the form, but
did acknowledge that only Milguyarri used it.
George Huddleston Yalkpayarri insists that other speakers
not from Pine Creek do not speak 'correctf Wagiman, although
the research shows only slight differences between the two
groups of speakers. His opinion could merely reflect his
chauvanism concerning language, and his personal animositytowards others not from Pine Creek. Information provided in
Tryon's (1971) description, although sparse, does not indicate any strong or obvious differences either, despite being
recorded from a speaker (now deceased) who lived in Adelaide
River, and who presumably had associations with that area
rather than the south-west.
Yalkpayarri also spoke of 'light' and 'heavy' Wagiman, but
it was quite frankly impossible to understand what the difference was when he gave examples or tried to explain, due
to articulatory problems such as his lack of teeth and his
habit of speaking with a pipe clenched between his gums. An
impression was that it was based at least on the use of some
lexical synonyms, but no other conclusive differences could
be heard. Other speakers also acknowledged the existence of
'light' and 'heavy' varieties, but would not or could not
give concrete examples.
0.6Orientation of descriptionAs far as possible, this grammar aims at providing a neutral
description of the language of the remaining Wagiman speakers. It is written in the morphosyntactic tradition m f
Australian Aboriginal language grammars, perhaps best typified by the descriptions found in the Handbook of Australian
Languages series, edited by R.M.W. Dixon and B.J. Blake.
The description is concerned, in the first instance, with
phonology, morphology and identifiable syntactic structures.
Secondly, it attempts as far as possible to provide functional explanations for the various restrictions, co-occurrences or other phenomena which occur, although specific
theory-based explanations have been avoided. Occasionally,
speculative historical hypotheses are proposed in regard to
the origin of some linguistic features.
Because of the low number of speakers, the great difficulty
in obtaining material and the poor outlook for the continued
survival of Wagiman, this grammar can be seen as what iscommonly known as a 'salvage description' in Australian
linguistics (see again, for example, the descriptions in
Dixon and Blake 1979, 1981 and 1983), in which a record is
made of the language before the last speakers die. In situations such as these, the amount of grammatical material
recorded is generally less than would be possible if a large
group of speakers were available, among whom the linguist
could record varying types of data, or choose among speakers
as teachers. To a certain extent, and because of these
difficulties, the amount of data recorded for Wagiman is not
complete, and some areas are better recorded than others.
Data on discourse strategies, narrative technique, conversational and other competence data is certainly incomplete
in this sense, and many other interesting aspects of the
language have proved difficult to elicit in significant
numbers; lexical gaps in the corpus also occur because of
the fragmentary nature of the fieldwork. Where there is a
general lack of data, or only a small number of examples
have been recorded, then this is indicated.
It now also
appears that the best time for research on the language is
past, with the increasing ill-health of old speakers and the
difficulty in inducing others to provide material making
further serious research a doubtful possibility.
0.7Previous researchThere has been virtually no previous research on the Wagiman
language. An early reference to 'Waggaman' by Rose in Oates
(1975:17) has so far proved impossible to find; it does not
appear in the bibliography of that work, and a search of
index cards at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal
Studies library revealed no listed work by Rose containing a
reference to the language. A reference to 'Wagaman' by
Stanner also in Oates (1975:17) again does not appear in the
bibliography. An examination of the cross-referenced index
of the Stanner collection at the A.I.A.S. library also revealed no reference to 'Wagaman'. A search through other
Stanner works (1933a, b, c, 1937) contained no reference tothe language name either. It would appear that the reference must be to unpublished material by Stanner held in the
A.I.A.S. library, but staff have been unable to find it.
No other early linguistic or ethnographic references are
known, and it would seem that the Wagiman people were either
ignored or inaccessible at the time of anthropological research into other groups in the area. Stanner (in the works
cited above) seems to have concentrated on groups to the
east or west of the Wagiman people, and never to have worked
in their traditional area.
Two more recent studies of the language have been limited.
D. Tryon undertook a very brief study in the course of his
research on the Daly River languages, and his findings have
been published (Tryon 1971).
They suffer from the obvious
brevity of the research, and the work itself is also very
short. In 1980, M. Harvey, then employed by the School of
Australian Linguistics, undertook research on the language
over a period of six months. His field notes are unpublished, but were available to me as photocopies; he made no tape
recordings. The data recorded comprises mainly prefix and
pronoun forms, elicited sentence translations and vocabula'ry
items. There are some short transcribed texts, but whether
they are free or from translations is unclear. Unfortunately, the quality of the photocopies is very poor, and, in
have been misplaced and are no longer available. None of
Harvey's material has been used here, although some of it
was useful as elicitation material, and suggested several
directions for research. David Zorc, also of S.A.L., has
recorded a short word list which was available to me.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"
"Because only about half the lexical items with initial dorsal and laminal stops are completely predictable in their
voicing quality, a possible contrast might be proposed wordinitially for these points of articulation. However, all
words that commence with a voiceless stop can, without any
change in meaning or speaker recognition, be realized with
the equivalent voiced stop. Rather than a situation of
contrast, this implies free variation among a limited number
of words and stops. Nevertheless, the notion of free vari-,Ii36
ation would seem to be inappropriate. An important fact is
that only approximately half the recorded words containing
initial dorsal and lamina1 stops have unpredictable voicing.
There is, moreover, not really any variation in the true
sense of 'free variation' (noting that free variation is not
necessarily 'free', where discourse or social factors can
underly variation), because speakers rarely 'vary' from one
realization to the other, but usually use the same realization in nearly every utterance. Variation occurs across
indivi-dual speakers, rather than within a speaker's idiolect.
It is only when initial stop voicing is tested in
citation sessions, or recorded occasionally in unelicited
speech, that variation tends to occur.
Instead of a situation of free variation, this behaviour
suggests a possible linguistic change in progress, from one
realization of word-initial stops to another. Although a
sound change is likely to be phonetically abrupt, it will be
diffused through a speaker's vocabulary only gradually (Wang
1969:14-15).
It is possible that such a process is occurring in Wagiman, in which only a part of the vocabulary of
speakers has so far been affected. However, the question of
directionality and rate arises: whether the change is towards a voiceless realization for all initial stops, in
which case it has only just begun, or whether it is towards
a voiced realization, and is therefore nearly complete.
Although directionality is difficult to determine, areal
evidence tends to suggest that initial voiced stops are
typical, and that any change which is occurring is in that
direction.
In most languages with in the area, the contrast is neutralized with voiced stops word-initially. 8
Methods for the determination of the directionality and
rate of linguistic change in progress are described in Bailey (1973), but are based on large numbers of speakers,
clearly categorized into socially and otherwise distinct
groups. This approach is not possible for Wagiman.
In some Yolngu languages, however, it is possible for
stops to be voiceless initially, although there is variation37It would seem likely that, if Wagiman has developed a stop
contrast along lines similar to those of other languages, or
if it has assimilated one as an areal feature, it would also
tend similarly to move towards voiced realizations.
Evidence for original. voiceless initial stops from within
the language is sparse, although the voiced initial stop in
biyakin 'sister' ([biyakin]) is voiceless following prefixation with the Female kin reference prefix gal- (cf. 6.3.6):
qal-piyakin ([qalpiyakin]).
The alternation from voiced to
voiceless would seem to be unmotivated phonetically: both
voiced and voiceless stops can occur phonemically following
1
and the phonetic eovironment in gal-piyakin following
the stop (apart from stress), remains unchanged. A possible
conclusion is that the original stop was voiceless but is
now only reflected in the pronunciation following the prefix, while the voiced realization has developed with other
word-initial voiced stops.
An apparently contradictory example is found in the participle form guka 'sleep' ([kuka]), which has an initial
voiceless stop.
Following prefixation as a finite verb,
however, the stop is voiced, so that 4s-guka-n 'I am sleeping' ( lsg-sleep-PRES) is phonetically [gagukanj. Several
points can be noted here. The first is tbat the voiced
realization could be due to assimilation of the stop to the
voicing of the surrounding vowels, although the following
intervocalic voiceless stop would then remain unexplained.
As a general rule, however, initial stops in finite verb
roots and suffixes are voiced, so [g] in [gagukan] might be
the result of an analogous levelling process. The initial
[k] in the participle guha can also be pronounced as [g],
although it is rare. One possible conclusion that can be
drawn is that [kuka] reflects an original, as yet unchanged,which might be due to conditioning factors; there is so far
no evidence of consistent association with any phonetic
feature later'in the word (B. Schebeck pers. comm.).","[53, 54, 55]"

(and) they sent a telegram for the policeman

5.3.5Possessive functionThe Oblique pronouns contrast subtly with the Possessive
pronouns. Unlike the Possessive pronouns themselves, which
express possession directly, the Oblique pronouns imply a
more indirect possessive relation, usually translated into
English with the phrase 'of mine', 'of yours' etc. They are
also used to express the idea of 'belonging to', inasmuch as
this means 'associated with'.
Like the Possessive pronouns the Obliq'xe pronouns can function as the genitive head of an NP, or as s direct pronominal
possessive argument of a predicate; they are effectively
identical in syntactic function with the Possessive pronouns. There remains, however, the slight difference in
meaning.
The following examples of the Oblique pronouns are contrasted directly with similar examples with Possessive pronouns,
in order to illustrate the semantic differences involved:5-19qi-bu-nigatan2sg:PFV-hit-PASTthatlamarra

contrast with other examples given above, where only an

Oblique pronouns might be in free variation with Absolutive
Base pronouns in expressing the direct object (affected

not understood in relation to the functions associated with
the Oblique pronouns generally.","[124, 125, 126]"

complement of a finite clause containing a verb of motion,
usually 'to go', but also 'to come'. Furthermore, Intentional complement clauses do not contain the intonation break
before the participle that often occurs with Ablative or
Dative marked participles, and are effectively identical in
form and intonation to a typical nominal Allative complement
of a verb of motion. The lack of a logical link between the
verb and the participle reinforces the possibility that
Intentional participle examples are not the same type of
adclausal complement constructions as the Purposive and
Causative types, but are merely Allative nominal complements
of a verb of motion.","[281, 282]"

pronominal prefixes, and which can also occur once as an
overt free NP. In this case it usually occurs between the
two predicates, and it is difficult to assign it to one
clause or the other. Like some COMP constructions, REL
constructions are usually uttered with the intonation contour of a single phonological phrase.
As for all adjoined clauses, there is no overt marking to
signal any 'relative clause' status, and conjoined clause
interpretations are always possible. Relative clause translations in English are often provided by speakers, however,
and the single intonation contour for both clauses also
indicates a REL construction status.",[328]
"would become neutralized with the 3sg Imperfective form gaif the systematic alternation of g- with g- for Perfective
and Imperfective were applied to it. The functional problems created by this particular potential neutralization
might have been too great to be resolved by pragmatic or
other contextual factors, and might have blocked the use of
g- for lsg. It could be imagined that the identity of 3sg
and lsg prefixes would place the system under strain, even
with the availability of optional free pronouns. Very few
functional problems arise from the aspect neutralization,
however, and apparently none that are quite as critical as
the potential first and third person singular neutralization. Pragmatic factors, optionally available tense suffixes
and the less critical information expressed by the aspectual
difference itself seem to combine to prevent them from arising.
However, it is likely that the neutralization of lpl and 2sg
forms generally would also cause problems, particularly for
the lpl/2sg and 2pl/lsg functions (giqgu-, giqgu-, miggu-)
in questions such as, for example, 'Who is going to get
meat? Are you (pl) getting meat for us, or are we getting
Unfortunately, the lack of recorded
meat for you (sg)?'
conversational material in the language makes the normal
method of resolution of such potential problems difficult to
state. In the few recorded examples of giqgu- (it is a
relatively rare form insone-to-one language sessions because
in all its references, one actant is lpl), it occurred with
an overt Ergative case marked agent, or an unmarked (Absolutive) pronominal patient. The lpl inclusive suffix q a n a
can also be used in intransitive clauses to indicate explicitly that the agent referent is lpl, but is structurally
ambiguous in transitive clauses when it occurs without overt
nominals to indicate the grammatical function of its referent (cf. 6.4.3).","[220, 221]"
"Despite the productivity of the system generally, it is not
predictable for some cases, such as yorrtja + ge-na to mean
'to find' where ge-na usually means 'to put1, or for getja +
ge-na meaning 'to ask1. The latter example is understandable if getja is taken as meaning something like 'question',
but it is not a predictable combination: a finite verb such
as ya'an 'to say' would seem a priori to be just as likely,
but, in fact, does not occur.
11.6Oblique contrastive constructionsOblique contrastive constructions are not well represented
in the corpus numerically, and speakers did not respond well
to attempts to elicit them. However, the recorded occurrences are recognized by the presence of an Oblique (and
occasionally Possessive) pronoun, often marked with the
Specific referent suffix, as the complement of a copula
verb. A small number are functionally c~mparativeclauses,
while others merely contrast two propositions, one of which
can be seen as the converse of the other. The Specific
referent suffix also occurs in non-Oblique contrastive sentences, to mark the item being contrasted (see 6.3.4).
Most
of the following examples were unelicited.
The recorded comparative constructions comprise either one
or two clauses. Some examples provided by Lulu Martin Dalpalngali utilise yu-gin 'to be' and ya-qgi 'to go' as copula verbs, with an Oblique pronoun marking the object of
comparison (the 'standard'); George Allen Mundeng provided
one example (a translation elicitation) as a verbless equational clause.
Lulu Martin, on one occasion, gave two consecutive examples
which differ slightly. In one, the comparative nominal
occurs as the subject of the clause, with an Oblique pronominal complement expressing the object of comparison. A
second 'comparative' clause containing an antonym of the
quality being compared also follows the first to express
unambiguously exactly which referent has which quality. An
8interesting point in this clause is that the object of comparison is stated again as an Oblique pronoun complement of
the verb in either a type of 'impersonal' or 'Oblique subject' construction: because of ordering flexibility in
general, and the lack of nominal subject marking in particular, it is not possible to tell which NP is subject of the
verb yu- in the second clause of 11-56.

effect, linking its referent with previous 3sg pronominal

"Within the class of nominals, various sub-classes can be
determined, as follows:
Pronouns: nominals which refer to the speech
act participants themselves, and which can have anaphoric
reference to other nominals;
(1)(ii)
Demonstratives: nominals which indicate reference to a particular nominal, or to a real world object or
place through reference to the speech act participants as
loci of relative proximity;
(iii)
Interrrogative pro-forms:
nominals which
function as interrogative items, and which have meanings
such as 'what', ' whof, 'where' etc.
The classification of pronouns as a distinct sub-class is
justifiable on semantic and syntactic grounds. Their semantic differences (involving personal deictic reference) are
apparent, but they also differ from other nominals syntactically in not being able to be the nominal head of a predicative possessive pronoun (see 5.2).
There also exists the
series of pronominal prefixes which occur on verbs (see
Chapter 7).
These are not 'free' like other nominals and
are thus in a separate distributional class, but their notional and functional similarity to free pronouns means that,
while they may not be classified as pronouns themselves,
they can be classified at least as pronominal verb-adjuncts.
Demonstratives are also easily defined on semantic grounds,
and it is of descriptive value to oppose them both to pronouns and other sub-classes of nominal~as a group.
Interrogative pro-forms can be defined syntactically because
they mark a distinct mood category of interrogation. Because they can be marked for case and also occur in core
grammatical functions, they are clearly in the same paradigmF1
i1
tclass as other nominals described here.
Although 'interrogation' is elsewhere in the language a semantic distinction, and is not marked morphologically or syntactically,
interrogative pro-forms can be seen as a clear sub-class of
nominals (cf. 10.3).
It will be noted that no sub-class (or class) of 'adjectives' is proposed. The sub-classification of predicate
nominals (adjectives), as distinct from argument nominals is
slightly problematic, On syntactic, morphological and distributional grounds there is no basis for distinguishing a
class of adjectives, either closed or open, in the lang-II
I
1uage.
However, some nominals are highly likely to occur
predicatively, while for others this is less likely.
Although a semantic distinction between predicate nominals
and argument nominals can be drawn relatively clearly in
Wagiman between words such as 'woman' or 'meat food ' , which
are less likely predicates, and 'soft' or 'hard', which are
less likely arguments, many nominals,can function equally as
both. Furthermore, all predicatively used nominals can
almost certainly be used as argumentsea Words such as those
given can therefore be seen as part of a functional continuum for nominals that would include all the sub-classes of
cominals in the language, with argument function at one
pole, and predicate function at the other.","[105, 106, 107]"
"[LMD 3851Chapter 6
6.1Nominal suffixing morphologyPreliminary remarksNominals can be suffixed with a range of case and other
suffixes to express a wide variety of grammatical relations.
In many descriptions of Australian languages two types of
nominal suffixes are usually distinguished, often defined as
'inflectional1 and 'derivational', even though the 'derivational' suffixes are not necessarily involved in altering
'part-of-speech' membership.
This is explicitly stated in
Dixon (1980:322-3) in the following way:
'Each word has an obligatory root and final inflection; between these two constituents there can
optionally occur one or more of a number of derivational suffixes. Some will de~ivea stem with a
different part-of-speech membership from that of
the original root; other derivational affixes will
not affect syntactic function.'
Such a definition of 'derivation' includes affixes which
'derive' a nominal stem from another nominal, such as number
marking affixes. However, more traditional definitions of
'inflection' and 'derivation' are based on whether or not
lexical items marked with a particular affix are members of
the same paradigm (Matthews 1974:37-8).
If an affix does
not change the word class membership or affect the syntactic
function of a lexical item in any way (ie. alter its paradigm class) it is inflectional.","[139, 140, 141]"
"I297
However, in transitive verbs where new patients are acted
upon, they need specification with a free nominal. The
preponderance of overt object norninals in the texts, as
opposed to agents or subjects is a function of this process.
The general tendency of focussed material to occur at the
beginning of the clause (Mallinson and Blake 1981:152) can
also produce an overt free nominal in an early position in a
clause, where it would not necessarily be expected on other
grounds; the 'new-before-old' principle is thus not absolute, and can be countered by relative focus.

followed by an Oblique object can be generally discounted as
V O(b1) sentences because the construction is a fixed expression used to introduce and close direct quotations (see
particularly text LMD 2 .in Appendix 1 and section 11.4.3
below).
Si also tended to precede, rather than follow V
(again in a ratio of approximately 3 to I), as described in
Figure 11-6:Figure 11-6Relative order of Si, A, 0 and V in s i n g l e NP0 before A/V360 after A/V12(Obl after V41Si before V25Si after V8Ignoring X material, the following generalizations summarize
the constituent orders recorded in clauses containing at
least one NP:(i)
the most favoured free nominal in two-place
clauses was 0;
(ii)
when 0 occured as the only free NP, it tended
to precede V;
(iii)
in intransitive clauses with a free NP subject, Si tended to precede V;
(iv)
V was the most common sentence-final constituent, and 0 was the most common initial item;(v)
the few clauses containing two core NPs showed
no clearly favoured orders.i,IIThe only fact exhibited by these generalizations is that V .
tended to follow any overt nominal that occurred; little
else can be stated with certainty. A 'basic order' of the
constituents Si, A, 0 and V cannot be determined from such
data, both because of the lack of any favoured order, but
also because of the lack of clauses containing two core NPs.
Wagiman is thus a language for which sentence constituent
typology is largely irrelevant, because of its lack of a
basic word order. In conclusion, 'word order1 (the order of
major constituents) in Wagiman must be described as 'free',
but in which the occurrence and order of elements is a function of strong pragmatic constraints.
11.3Simple sentences (verbless equational
constructions)Simple sentences are those which contain only one predicate
and are not logically linked to any other clause. Three
types can be defined: (i) finit.e verb clauses; (ii) participle imperative clauses; and (iii) verbless equational
clauses. Finite clauses with participles are considered to
be internally 'complex1; their morphology, function and
semantics were described in Chapter 9, and their syntax is
treated below in 11.5.","[315, 316, 317]"
"Ergative case marking can also occur on the nominal agent of
the verb ya'an ' to say1, 'to tell' to distinguish the two
different meanings. When it is used to mean 'to tell' and
occurs with an overt object such as 'story', Ergative case
marking can occur on the agent; when it means 'to say' and
is followed by reported speech, Ergative marking does not
occur, In both constructions, the addressee is usually
expressed by an Oblique pronoun or an unmarked free nominal.
Examples 6-6 and 6-7 can be compared for this feature (the
root form of yapan is yam-):
6-6qigun-yi
2sg-ERGgi-yam-pi

away. t
The occurrence of Ergative case marking can thus be related
generally to the presence of a patient, either perceived orovert, in the clause. It can be seen, however, that transitivity of participles also affects the presence of Ergative
case marking, so that morphological ergativity is not necessarily triggered only by the transitivity of the finite
verb. Rather than being the grammatical reflex of the subcategorization of verbs into classes of 'transitive' and
'intransitive', Ergative case marking actually reflects the
'transitivity' value of any transitive item in the clause.","[146, 147]"
"No historical conclusions present themselves from these
comparisons, but there is plainly a link of some sort
between the forms of the various pronouns. Such a putative
link is made more clear when the possessive function of the
Oblique pronouns is compared with that of the Possessive
pronouns themselves (see 5.3.5), and the use of Oblique
pronouns in an apparent direct object function (see 5.3.6).kThe alternant forms gogin and guggugin for 2sg in the Possessive pronoun series can be examined in comparison with
the 2sg Oblique form. The Possessive form gogin is clearly
unrelat3d to the 2sg Oblique g q g u , but q q g u g i n follows the
pattern whereby the Possessive pronoun is the same as the
Oblique form, but with the addition of the apparent suffix
-gin. Thus 2sg Possessive qur~guginseems to be a back-formation from 2sg OBL quggu, and seems to be completely interThe possible dialectal reason for
changeable with gogin.
the variation is difficult to isolate from different speakers' own apparently idiolectal variation, although they all
seemed to accept, and could provide, both forms. For the
moment, they can only be considered as free variants.
The Oblique pronouns have a variety of grammatical functions, although these all (except (vi) below) seem to be
linked by the 'obliqueness' of their referents' relationship
with the clausal predicate; they can be summarized as fol-they specify the pronominal object complement
of some intransitive verbs and clauses;
they express the pronominal benefactive complement of a verb or clause;
they are used to express pronominal allative
and locative complements of a clause, as well as the indirect addressee of the verb yawan 'to say';101
( iv)they express the topic of a story ('about
someone') or the subject matter of an action or process;(v)
they function as markers of possession in a
manner similar to, but subtly different from, the Possessive
pronouns; and
(Ti)
they occur marking an affected
patient in an apparent accusative function.pronominalAll these functions are semantically linked, with the exception of (vi) , where they apparently refer to NPs in a considerably more direct relation with the predicate. The
feature common to the majority is that they express the idea
that an activity or object in the clause is linked in some
loose way with the referent of the pronoun, either in terms
of locational or figurative association, benefit or possession. This shared feature can be seen in all the examples
given below, and explains why it is possible that the Obiique pronouns can be used in such an apparently wide range
of functions.
Where the Oblique pronouns are used to express the complement of an intransitive clause or the beneficiary of 'an action, a relevant feature is also reduced transitivity: the
action is not directly impinging upon the referent of the
pronoun as in more transitive clauses with an Absolutive
object or goal. The link between the predicate action and
the Oblique pronoun is thus only one of loose, rather than
tightly involved, semantic association.
The same situation can be found with the other associative
and possessive uses of the Oblique pronouns: the referent
of the pronoun is linked with the action, or as in the case
of possession, with another nominal as well, by an oblique
association only, and the hearer determines from context and
the syntactic structure of the utterance which interpretation is appropriate.i
\+/The Oblique pronouns can be used in the place of some noncore case (Absolutive or Ergative) pronouns, and examples
with Obliques substituted for Allative, Dative and Possessive forms have been recorded. The fact that the Obliques
do not fulfil any function that is not already potentially
expressed by case-marked Base pronouns is puzzling. Moreover, rather than being as explicit as Allative or Dative
(Benefactive) marked pronouns, the Oblique pronouns merely
specify a general oblique relationship. It is also not
possible in some examples to derive an explicit interpretation of either an Allative or Benefactive relation because
both can seem equally appropriate in the context.
Their
proper function might be, in fact, that they can be used
where no precise interpretation is intended or required;
there is some evidence to suggest that where a specific
statement is being made, then overtly case marked Base pronouns are used.
The contrast between the Possessive pronouns and the Oblique pronouns in possessive function is of
this type.: the 0bl.iqe pronouns appear to imply a looser
sense of possession, one more of association between objects
rather than strict ownership (see 5.3.5).
Importantly here, in the examples where the Oblique pronouns
are used for pronominal referents that are apparently in a
direct object relation with their predicate, there is some
doubt that a highly transitive relation actually holds.
This is examined in 5.3.6.
5,3,1Object complement of an intransitive clause or verbIntransitive clauses with an object
complement are relatively rare, but comprise an intransitive verb and an optional
intransitive participle (cf. chapter 9):

"9.2.2.3Orientational participle functionThis function is very restricted, and to a certain extent
corresponds to the ambient structural use of participles.
However, two forms, werr'ma and lema have been recorded
whose function appears to be one of orienting the action in
space and direction. The specific function and meaning of
these two words is highly dependent on the finite verb with
which they occur, but typically they describe the directional orientation of the action. Generally, rerr'ma means
'(action) (occur) outside', but can also be used to state
that the direction of the action or state was 'outwards' in
relation to something else. lema is similar, and means
'(action) (occur) inside', or '(action) inwards'. Both can
thus be used in predicate adjective function with a copula
verb to mean 'be inside' and 'be outside'.
They usually occur in same-subject constructions, but the
link between the subject or agent of the finite verb and the
apparent subject or agent argument of the participle is not
always clear:

The explicit incluson of a nominal object such as 'water' or
'food' in examples like 9-31 has not been recorded, but the
context seems to indicate that it would be the object of da'to eat'. 33da-yi means 'to eat' in its unmarked use, but can also
mean generally ' to ingest ' when :ised with' participles, permitting an interpretation of either 'eat ' or 'drink' , depending on the participle.
