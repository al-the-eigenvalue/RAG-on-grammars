"We now turn to the negation in copula and in locative/existential constructions.
The negative particle caa is contracted with the copula verb t++ as a contracted form
58cat+ ‘is not,’ which is placed directly in front of what is to be negated. Example (30) is
an affirmative copula sentence, and (31) is the negative version with the contracted
negative particle and copula.","[76, 77]"
"Negation in imperative sentences is, at first sight, indicated by the potential
marker -cuma, as in (36). However, this grammatical marker does not have a negative
meaning itself as it is also used in affirmative contexts. The reason for this preliminary
confusion is due to the omitability of the negative particle in combination with the second
person singular pronoun, comparing (36) with (37). The possibility of omitting the
negative particle and the grammatical person does not exist if the negative imperative
sentence is directed to other grammatical persons. Refer to section §4.6.3 for a detailed
discussion.",[78]
"Besides the above-mentioned elements, the negative particle can also appear in the X
position in certain types of clauses63 (i.e. interrogatives, subordinate clauses) under
irrealis mood. First, we see a negative interrogative clause in realis mood, as in (231).
Negation is expressed through a negative morpheme marked on the verb and a negative
particle in the postverbal position.",[164]
"221Finally, desideratives can be used in either affirmative sentences, as above, or negative
sentences, as in (378).","[239, 240]"
"4.3.2 Ji-caa Negation
Ji-caa negation uses the negative particle caa, plus an additional negative
morpheme -ji attached to the verb root, to negate a clause. This strategy is used in the
following types of clauses: wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft
constructions. Complement and adverbial clauses can adopt either caa negation or ji-caa
negation. In ji-caa negation, both -ji and caa contribute to the negation meaning. The
negative marker -ji is a portmanteau morpheme which encodes both the negation and the
clause-type information. The fact that it also conveys the negation meaning is supported
by two pieces of evidence. First, it is ungrammatical for it to appear in an affirmative
171clause; second, in some cases, caa is omitted while the clause still retains its negation
meaning. It is possible to consider ji-caa negation as a type of negative agreement since it
agrees with the type of the clause it occurs. However, it is unlike a typical inflectional
agreement marker for the following reasons. First, it cannot appear freely in any negative
clause, but only in wh-questions, relative clauses, and embedded clauses of cleft
constructions. Second, it attaches to the root (as opposed to stem) form of the verb, which
indicates that it behaves more like a derivational morpheme in Iquito. Diagram 7 shows
that the negative particle caa follows the inflected verb and the negative morpheme -ji is
suffixed to the verbal root, preceding tense and aspect information.","[189, 190]"
"Examples (289) and (290) show that some negative clauses can be marked only
by the negative morpheme -ji, although this is not common and not agreed on by all the
speakers. The fact that a given negative clause can possibly be marked with only the
negative morpheme -ji confirms its negation meaning.",[194]

the perception of the speakers. The current negation section does not include a theoretical
analysis of negation structure. For a proposed theoretical analysis, please refer to Lai
(2006b) for more discussion.
There are two principal strategies of clausal negation in Iquito: one uses the
negative particle caa (referred to as caa negation hereafter) and the other uses the
negative morpheme -ji in combination with the negative particle caa (referred to as ji-caa
negation hereafter). In caa negation, the negative particle caa precedes a pronominal
subject or a non-topicalized subject phrase, and follows a topicalized element if any. This
strategy is generally used in principal/independent declarative clauses and yes/no
questions. In ji-caa negation, the negative particle caa follows an inflected verb, in which
the verbal root is followed by the negative morpheme -ji, followed by tense and aspect
information. This strategy is generally used in wh-questions, relative clauses, and
embedded clauses of cleft constructions. While caa negation does not have variation in
irrealis mood, ji-caa negation varies structurally in irrealis clauses. The negative particle
caa in ji-caa negation may appear repetitively in the postverbal position as well as in
preverbal position if no other elements appear between the subject and the verb of an
irrealis clause (detailed in §4.3.2). In adverbial and complement clauses, either one of
these two strategies can be used.","[185, 186]"
"It is noted that the combination of General Perfective Aspect -Ø and the potential mood
-cuma is only used in the context of a negative imperative or negative jussive. It is never
used in an affirmative context. From the discussion above, we can see that in both
affirmative and negative constructions, the word order is observed to reflect realis word
order—SVX. The speakers indicate that they expect the addressed events or the
associated process of the addressed events to be realized upon uttering the sentences. The
following are two textual examples. The speaker expects that the situation can be realized
right away.

"4.3.1 Caa Negation
Caa negation uses the negative particle caa in the pre-subject position to negate
an entire clause. It is used in matrix clauses of declarative sentences and yes-no
questions. Diagram 6 below shows the structural position of caa in relation to other
168constituents of the clause. When there is a topic element in the negative clause, caa
follows this element; otherwise, it precedes a non-topic element.","[186, 187]"
"239morpheme of potential mood -cuma.97 Negative imperatives and jussives are only used
before negative events are realized. In both affirmative and negative constructions,
speakers indicate that they expect the addressed events or the associated process of the
addressed events to be realized upon uttering the sentences.
I have analyzed imperative (§4.6.1) and jussive (§4.6.2) sentences as tenseless
because there are no counterpart sentences that are overtly marked with a tense
morpheme. In addition, Sadock and Zwicky (1985: 172) indicate that tense and aspect
distinctions in imperatives are relatively uncommon crosslinguistically. The fact that
Iquito uses different perfective aspects in imperatives might be a reflection of the
historical development of the aspect morphemes from verbs indicating direction and path.
In terms of realis/irrealis marking, which is realized by word order, both
affirmative and negative imperatives and jussives are observed to reflect realis word
order SVX, instead of irrealis word order SXV. Payne (1997) indicates that imperatives
are usually expressed with irrealis structures crosslinguistically, reflecting the fact that an
imperative commands that something happen rather than asserting that it has already
happened. Given the fact that affirmative jussives can be used when the event is already
in actual progress, the perfective aspects, together with the realis word order SVX, in the
affirmative imperatives, negative imperatives and jussives express a strong expectation of
the realization of addressed events. Indeed, some affirmative imperatives, especially
when the addressees are first person plural inclusive or second person plural, might be
structurally ambiguous with a perfective sentence which indicates a realized event.
However, these imperatives and perfective declaratives are generally distinguished by the
97 Themorpheme of potential mood -cuma does not only appear in the negative constructions of
imperatives and jussives, in which it appears with an unmarked perfective aspect. It is also used in
combination with the Imperfective Aspect, in both affirmative and negative sentences, to indicate an
uncertain prediction or a weak wish in which the speaker is not certain if the event will be realized. The
events in this construction are further remote in the future.","[257, 258]"
"The locative/existential is expressed as iiquii ‘there is/are’ in the affirmative
context, as in (32). In the negative context, the existential is expressed as ajapaqui ‘there
isn’t/aren’t’ (33), while the locative is conveyed through the expression of caa …iiquii
‘isn’t/aren’t’ (here/there)’ (34).",[77]
"Unlike caa negation, ji-caa negation presents many syntactic variations sensitive
to mood (i.e. in irrealis clauses). The negative particle in such clauses can appear after the
verb, as in the basic pattern, before and after the verb, or only before the verb in some
cases. Recalling the requirement of irrealis mood (i.e. one element should occupy the
position between the subject and the verb), when this requirement is fulfilled, then caa
173stays in the postverbal position, maintaining the basic pattern. When the object of a
clause is dislocated to form a wh-question, or stays in the postverbal position, the
negative particle caa appears between the subject and the verb, by which the requirement
of irrealis mood is fulfilled. Sometimes, when caa already appears in the preverbal
position, it does not appear again in the postverbal position. In each variation, the verb is
obligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.
In sentence (283), -ji marks the verb, followed by the negative particle caa,
displaying the basic pattern of ji-caa negation. The wh-word is the subject, followed by
the object phrase nu-nasi ‘his garden,’72 followed in turn by the verb. This is the
configuration of irrealis mood (SXV word order).","[191, 192]"
"170The final point of caa negation is that the negative structure is not sensitive to
mood. That is to say, the syntactic position of the negative particle does not vary because
of the grammatical mood. Sentence (276) expresses realis mood (SVX word order), with
General Perfective Aspect and Recent Past Tense, while sentence (279) expresses irrealis
mood (SXV order), with Momentary Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. The
negative particle caa in both sentences follows the topicalized element and precedes the
pronominal subject, remaining in the same position structurally.","[188, 189]"
"2.3.2 Negation
There are three major types of negation in Iquito: sentential negation with lexical
verbs, negation of locative and existential constructions, and negation of imperatives.
This section introduces negation with lexical verbs (detailed in §4.3), negation in locative
and existential constructions and negation in imperatives (detailed in §4.6.3).
In Iquito, sentential negation in principal and independent clauses is expressed
differently from embedded and interrogative clauses. As such, there are two main
patterns of sentential negation. The first main pattern of sentential negation, named caa
negation, exists in independent or principal declarative sentences. The negative marker
caa precedes the pronoun subject or follows the topicalized item if there is any. The
second main pattern of sentential negation, named ji-caa negation, exists in embedded
and interrogative clauses. Here a different negative morpheme -ji, which follows the
verbal root and precedes tense and aspect morphemes, is marked on the verb, and the
negative marker caa, which precedes the main verb in the first main pattern now follows
the main verb. See §4.3 for schematic structures of sentential negation.
In caa negation, the negative particle caa is placed at the beginning of the
utterance, if there is no topic element, to negate the entire sentence; it follows a
55topicalized element and precedes the resumptive pronoun. As can be seen in (22) in
comparison with (21), when the subject is a non-topicalized pronoun, the negative
particle caa is placed directly at the beginning of the sentence without changing the
position of the subject. On the other hand, if there is a topic element, as in (23), caa
follows such an element and precedes the resumptive pronoun, as in (24). Example (25)
is a case of constituent negation of the subject. As can be seen, the cleft construction is
used to express subject negation. It is noted that the negated subject cannot be repeated
again before the verb in the embedded clause, as in (26).","[73, 74]"
"Diagram 6. The Schematic Structure of Caa Negation
{topic} caa71{pronominal or non-topicalized subject}{verbal complex} {object}The negative particle caa can precede a pronominal subject, as can be seen in
(274). The sentence consists of an independent declarative clause, in which only caa is
used to negate the entire clause. No other negation marking is found on the verb.",[187]
"Note that expressions of constituent negation imply an affirmative presupposition before
the negative version is uttered. Therefore, expressions of constituent negation often imply
contrastive focus. The characteristics of Iquito constituent negation as focus are as
follows. First, when only a subject or an object is negated, instead of the entire clause,
only the negated constituent is fronted to the beginning of the sentence, separated from
the original clause. Second, a copula construction is adopted for the negated elements,
followed by a finite clause. The whole sentence is usually called a cleft construction.
Third, the negated elements are not repeated again in the embedded clause, which is very
similar to how focus is usually expressed crosslinguistically. Based on the abovementioned characteristics, it could be said that in Iquito, the cleft construction is used to
express focused elements (i.e. affirmative and the constituent negations). Another point is
that the relative pronouns iina/iimi/iip+ are not always obligatory. Although they are
preferred by some speakers, they are used more often when more than one embedded
clause is used. Example (27) shows that in a negative embedded clause, an additional
20 In Iquito, the difference between an independent clause and a dependent clause is that for a dependentclause, it is generally grammatical to add the word iina at the beginning of the clause. Iina can function as a
subordinator, a relative pronoun, a determiner or a demonstrative, depending on the context in which it
appears. In an independent clause, on the other hand, such an addition would otherwise make the sentence
ungrammatical.",[75]
"In (288), caa appears between the questioned subject and the verb marked with -ji. The
negative particle caa does not appear again in the postverbal position and the sentence is
grammatical.",[194]
"4.6.3 Negative Imperatives and Jussives
In negative contexts, imperatives and jussives have the same structure, both using
a negative particle caa (or ca= as a clitic) in combination with an unmarked perfective
261aspect -Ø and the morpheme of potential mood -cuma. Negative imperatives, also called
‘prohibitives,’ and jussives are only used before the negative events are realized.
As can be seen from (484) to (488) in the following, negative commands can have
all grammatical persons as the action-performing referents, except first person singular
and first person plural exclusive. The addressee(s) is second person. The speakers
commented that example (484) might be used to think to oneself: ‘I shouldn’t say
anything,’ but the sentence is never verbally uttered. Example (485) is ungrammatical. In
(486), the addressee is also one of the action-performing referents. In (487), it is noted
that the addressee is second person singular and the explicit mention of the subject is
optional. However, the negative particle and the second person singular subject pronoun
are either both omitted or both present. When the subject is one of the other grammatical
persons, the subject pronoun and the negative particle are obligatorily present, as in
(486), (488)-(490).","[279, 280]"
"The negative particle in caa negation can also precede a non-topicalized subject.
As can be seen in (275), caa precedes the nominal subject which is not topicalized.",[187]
"4.3 NEGATION AND MOOD
This section discusses clausal negation. Following the discussion in §4.2,
negation aligns with neither realis nor irrealis mood. The choice of realis or irrealis mood
depends on the temporal reference of the sentence; there is, therefore, no direct semantic
interaction or correlation between negation and mood. However, since the X position of
SXV word order, expressing irrealis mood, can be filled by a negative particle in an
irrealis clause, there is a certain structural interaction between negation and mood that is
worthy of discussion. This section includes only examples from declaratives and
interrogatives because other types of clauses, such as imperatives, use a completely
different negative morpheme and display a different syntactic structure. Negative
imperatives (i.e. prohibitives) are discussed in §4.6. Clausal negation in Iquito adopts two
strategies, one in matrix clauses and the other in subordinate clauses. The current
negation section discusses the matrix-clause strategy in §4.3.1, and the subordinateclause strategy70 in §4.3.2. In §4.3.3, I discuss the scope of negation and the function of
70 Anderson (2004b) discusses the Iquito negation in subordinate clauses extensively.",[185]
"In the above-mentioned contexts (i.e. affirmative and negative declaratives,
interrogatives, and non-CF conditionals), the situation in the sentence is in the past,
present, or immediate future. As such, realis mood seems to align with perception or
assessment of time, rather than with assertion.
When the situation in the sentences is in non-immediate future (i.e. from as soon
as later on the same day of SpT to the more remote future), irrealis mood is used. Again,
this applies to both affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives, and non-CF
conditionals. Sentence (251) refers to a situation which the speaker states that he will
realize later in the same day of SpT. As can be seen, the subject qui ‘1S’ is followed by
the object núquiica anitáaqui ‘a peccary,’ followed by the verb pani- ‘search.’ The
sentence displays SOV word order, expressing irrealis mood.",[173]
"The second type of sentential negation in Iquito exists in interrogative clauses and
subordinate clauses, including relative and adverbial clauses. In this type of construction,
a different negative morpheme -ji is marked on the verb, and the negative marker caa,
which precedes the verb in the first type, now follows the verb, as in (12).",[69]
"4.3.3 The Scope of Negation and the Function of the Two Strategies
In addition to the syntactic characteristics (i.e. type of clause) discussed above,
there is a correlation between the negation strategy, the scope of negation and the
178pragmatic function: caa negation has scope over the entire clause while ji-caa negation
has scope over only the verb phrase, excluding the subject of the clause. For example, in
wh-questions, the wh-word is not negated; only the rest of the clause is negated. This has
much to do with the function of the two negation strategies: caa negation negates the
clause without focusing any element, but ji-caa negation focuses the first element of the
clause and negates the rest of the clause. This corresponds to the fact that wh-questions,
relative clauses and embedded clauses are similar to cleft constructions, not only
structurally (i.e. using ji-caa negation) but also functionally (i.e. generally interpreted by
speakers as clefts and the first element focused). Recall also the phenomenon such that
adverbial and complement clauses can adopt both negation strategies. In Iquito, the
syntactic status of these types of clauses can be treated as subordinate clauses as well as
coordinated clauses. In addition, it is noted that this variation also corresponds to
different pragmatic functions (i.e. whether the first element of the clause focused or not).
In the following, I start the discussion with a comparison between the structure of cleft
constructions and that of clausal negation.
Sentence (297) consists of an affirmative clause. As seen in (298), to negate a
principal or independent clause, the negative particle caa is directly placed at the
beginning of the clause, which is caa negation.","[196, 197]"

negative declaratives (245), as well as interrogatives, including yes-no questions (246)
and wh-questions (247). The following three sentences all have SVO word order, with
subject pronouns preceding verbs in (245) and (246), and a subject interrogative pronoun
preceding the verb in (245).","[170, 171]"
"As is seen in (285), the sentence is ungrammatical when the object as well as the negative
particle remain in the postverbal positions (i.e. nothing appears between the subject and
the verb in a transitive irrealis clause).",[193]
"57negative morpheme -ji is attached to the verbal stem followed by the tense/aspect
information, followed by the negative particle caa.","[75, 76]"
"In (286), the negative particle caa both precedes and follows the verb marked with -ji.
The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’
and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order to
express the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.",[193]
"212complement. This construction is also used to rephrase the commands or wishes given by
a person other than the speaker. I call this construction ‘desiderative.’ Second, an optative
construction with Imperfective Aspect and the potential mood -cuma can also be used.
Third, they can use a CF wish construction, by which a speaker does not expect the
addressee to carry out the event.
The Desiderative expresses a past or present wish for an event to be realized (or
not) in the future relative to RT. The sentence can be affirmative or negative. The
addressee, if also the action-performing referent, is obligated to realize the event. The
Desiderative is frequently used to rephrase commands (i.e. imperatives or other directive
constructions) or wishes (i.e. by optatives) of other people. Correspondingly, the subject
of the verb nacar++- ‘want,’ the person who expresses the expectation, can be any
grammatical person and not necessarily the speaker of the sentence. The Optative,
marked with Imperfective Aspect in combination with the potential mood,85 expresses a
weak prediction or wish about a potential event in the distant future. The wish is
conveyed through implicature as this construction does not always express a wish and
generally expresses a prediction. The sentence can be affirmative or negative and the
person who expresses the prediction or wish is always the first person, which is the
speaker. A CF wish expresses a past or present counterfactual situation which the speaker
strongly desires to be realized or to have been realized. However, no action-performing
referent is obligated. The sentence can only be affirmative and the person who expresses
the wish can only be the first person, the speaker. I discuss desideratives in §4.5.1,
optatives in 4.5.2, and CF wishes in 4.5.3.","[230, 231]"
"From the examples shown above, we see that caa negation is not sensitive to
tense, aspect, or mood. The syntactic position of the negative particle remains the same,
following a topic element and preceding a pronominal or non-topicalized subject.",[189]

172In addition to wh-questions, relative clauses also adopt ji-caa negation. As can be seen in
(281), this sentence consists of a principal clause and a relative clause. In the principal
clause, the negative particle caa precedes the pronominal subject and in the relative
clause, caa follows the verb which is additionally marked with -ji.","[190, 191]"
"The lexical verb ‘want’ can be used to express a past or present wish about an
event being realized in the future relative to RT. The speakers commented that they
impose the obligation on the action-performing referents when they use these sentences
(affirmative or negative). The difference between these sentences and imperatives is that
these sentences seem to be less direct and impose slighter obligation. The imperative
sentence reflects the realis SVX word order87 while the complement clause of the verb
87 Imperatives display characteristics of both realis and irrealis mood in terms of structural features. For adetailed discussion, please refer to §4.2 and §4.6.",[233]
"Interrogative sentences (232) and (233), show that when the object appears at the
beginning of the sentence as a wh-word, as in (232), or remains in the postverbal position,
as in (233), the negative particle caa has to be copied to appear in the X position,
otherwise the sentence is ungrammatical. When a copy of the negative particle caa
appears in the X position, the postverbal caa can appear optionally without changing the
grammaticality of the sentence.",[165]
"In Iquito, there are two major types of sentential negation. The first one occurs in
independent declarative sentences. The negative particle caa precedes the pronoun
subject, as in (11), or follows the topicalized item if there is any. The position of caa is
not sensitive to tense, aspect, or mood under this type of construction.",[69]
"85 The potential mood -cuma is also used in another construction, in combination with the unmarkedGeneral Perfective Aspect -Ø, to express a negative imperfective in which a strong expectation about a
negative event being promptly realized is conveyed.",[231]
"71 Cynthia Anderson Hansen reminded me to add this information.The negative particle caa here is in
focus position and cannot co-occur with a focused element: Adverb occurs in focus position, as in (302);
with the introduction of negation, adverb occurs after the object, as in (303).",[187]
"238plural. Jussives are used when the action-performing or -involving referents are third
person singular or third person plural. The addressees of jussives are second person
singular or plural. Iquito imperatives and jussives can be used to give strong commands
in which non-compliance is not expected by speakers. In addition, they can also be used
to give permission, make requests, or provide instructions.
In affirmative contexts, imperatives and jussives are formally distinct structures
while in negative contexts, imperatives and jussives use the same type of formal
structure. Affirmative imperatives can appear with all seven perfective aspects,95 except
when they are pragmatically incompatible. In fact, the use of one of the seven perfective96
aspects is obligatory in affirmative imperatives. The seven perfective aspects render
different interpretations in terms of the location where the events are to be carried out
and, therefore, the direction and trajectory of addressees’ movement. The Imperfective
Aspect can never be used in the imperative constructions. The affirmative jussives, on the
other hand, appear only with the Imperfective Aspect and can never appear with any
perfective aspect. In correspondence with this formal observation, imperatives are used
before the potential event is realized while jussives can be used both before the event is
realized and when the event is already in progress.
In negative contexts, both imperatives and jussives use a negative particle in
combination with an unmarked perfective aspect, General Perfective Aspect, and the95 Thereare seven perfective aspects in Iquito: General Perfective, Momentary Perfective, Remote
Perfective, two Deictic Perfectives, Allative Perfective and Ablative Perfective, which are discussed in
detail in §5.
96 According to Patience Epps (p.c.), in some languages, in particular, aspectual indicators in imperatives
have a politeness function. For example, Hup perfective aspect makes a polite imperative to emphasize that
the imposition will be of limited duration (Epps, 2008). In Iquito, because perfective aspects are obligatory
in imperatives, the use of perfective aspect does not specifically carry a function of politeness. To make a
polite request, speakers could express imperatives in a softer tone. Alternatively, they might use other types
of clauses, such as desideratives. They could also express their expectations indirectly to another person
and have them indirectly convey their expectations to the intended addressee.","[256, 257]"
"4.5.2 Optatives
The second strategy, optatives, with the Imperfective Aspect and the potential
mood -cuma, is used to express a weak prediction or wish about a potential event in the
distant future. As optatives generally convey a prediction, the wish is conveyed through
implicature and is cancellable.91 The sentence can be affirmative or negative and the
person who expresses the prediction or wish is always the first person, the speaker.
Structurally, potential/optative -cuma patterns with other tense formatives (i.e. occupy the
same position in the morphological template of the verbal complex) and it also solely
applies to the situation in the distant future. Therefore, it arguably incorporates both
temporal and modal meanings.
In (379) below, the speaker who wishes feels uncertain as to whether the event
will be realized eventually. And even if the event will be realized, it will be a long time
after. The scenario of this sense is ‘when a child already passed the age he is supposed to91 In all contexts, the potential/optative -cuma expresses ‘a weak prediction about a situation in the distantfuture,’ which is the semantic meaning I claim for this morpheme. If a doctor uses -cuma and says ‘this
child might never talk,’ clearly he does not have such a negative wish; instead, he is making a weak
prediction based on his current diagnosis. However, as -cuma is frequently used in an affirmative sentence
by the speakers, such a sentence is frequently interpreted as a wish by the speakers. The ‘wish’ sense of the
morpheme -cuma, therefore, is yielded from its pragmatic use and is cancellable.",[240]

ji-caa negation and its variations below.
In the types of clauses introduced above, the negative particle caa follows the
verb. As can be seen in (280) which is a wh-question, caa is in the postverbal position
and -ji is marked after the verbal root, as part of the verbal complex. It is noted that -ji
appears after the verbal root to which only derivational morphemes attach. This suggests
that in Iquito -ji is considered a derivational morpheme.",[190]

to Anderson et al. (2006).
60 This, applying to both transitive and intransitive verbs, appears in complementizer-type clauses,
including wh-questions and subordinate clauses, when nothing appears between the subject and the verb. In
Iquito, clausal negation is sensitive to clause types, please refer to §4.3 for a detailed discussion.",[161]
"In §4.6 above, I discussed imperative and jussive constructions in Iquito in terms
of the sentence structure (i.e. the requirement of an explicit pronoun or not), the aspectual
morphemes with which they appear, and the mood structure (i.e. word order and relevant
characteristics) they associate with in a realis/irrealis system. Iquito imperatives are
directed to second person(s). Action-performing referents, on the other hand, can be first
person plural inclusive, second person singular, or second person plural. Jussives are
directed to second person(s) when the action-performing or -involving referents are third
person singular or third person plural.
In affirmative contexts, imperatives and jussives are formally distinct structures,
while in negative contexts, imperatives and jussives use the same type of formal
structure. In terms of realis/irrealis marking, which is realized by word order, both
affirmative and negative imperatives and jussives are observed to reflect realis word
order—SVX, instead of irrealis word order—SXV. In this section, I also discuss how
imperatives, when there is an explicit pronoun, are distinguished from past perfective
266declaratives in terms of high pitch and vowel lengthening on the subject pronoun. This
section concludes with a brief extension on how the potential mood marker is used in
constructions other than negative imperatives.
Iquito imperatives and jussives can be used to give strong commands in which the
realization of situations is highly expected by speakers. In addition, they can also be used
to give permission, make requests, or provide instructions.","[284, 285]"
"It is important to mention that when the negative particle caa already appears in
the preverbal position, in order to fulfill the requirement of irrealis mood, the sentence is
also grammatical if it does not appear in the postverbal position again. This phenomenon
is especially common in intransitive clauses, although it is also observed in transitive
clauses. In (287), caa appears after the wh-word, which is the subject, to fulfill the irrealis

If the X position is already filled by an element, caa cannot appear in that position, as in
(235).","[165, 166]"

3SThe particle jaari ‘already,’ since it combines with perfective situations, always advances
the narrative time in the text. Besides the properties of temporality, jaari and jaa can only
be used in affirmative sentences and are ungrammatical in negative contexts, therefore
patterning as Affirmative Polarity Items.
The temporal connectives atií and atiíja, both often glossed as ‘then’ or ‘there,’
are grammatically the same. They convey anaphoric time or location according to the
previous discourse. Spatially, the event in a given sentence containing these particles
takes place in the same location; temporally, the event in such a sentence has its SitT
overlapping with that of the previous discourse. If the sentence contains perfective
aspects, the event in the sentence is considered as a subevent of a larger event. For
example, in line 132 of the text above, the event [he grate it] shares the same location
with the event [he begin grate his root] in line 131. The sentence contains perfective
aspects, but the event therein can be considered as a subevent of a larger event [he grate
the root]. The temporal connectives atiíji and atiíjija, often glossed as ‘from then’ or
‘from there,’ on the other hand, signal change of location spatially from the previous
sentence or temporally discontinuous/separation of events. This means a sentence
containing atiíji and atiíjija indicates events considered as new events from the previous
discourse. Temporally, the event in such a sentence does not have its SitT overlapping
with that of the previous discourse. The following examples from the texts illustrate the
discussion here. The first text is from J++tarata canatanii in++si ‘How to Weave a
Hammock’ (lines 3-12).153 In line 4, which contains the particle atiíjija, the event, [you
dry this grass], takes place in a different location from that of line 3, [you cut the grass].
153 I include all the excerpted lines together in one chunk because later in the section when I discuss other
temporal connectives, I use examples from the same texts as well. The cited texts were transcribed by
various members of the ILDP, but is re-segmented, organized and translated by the author of the
dissertation.","[520, 521]"
"51marked structure. Example (13) shows that caa follows the interrogative subject and then
precedes as well as follows the verb. In (14), the interrogative object begins the sentence.
The negative particle caa follows the pronoun subject and then precedes as well as
follows the verb. The fact that caa can also occupy the object position in the SOV
environment further supports the idea that the SOV pattern is highly marked.","[69, 70]"
"Other cases of ji-caa negation, besides embedded clauses of cleft constructions, are whquestions and relative clauses. The speakers always interpret them in the same way they
interpret clefts, and they frequently insert the copular t++.74 Consider example (300).
Speakers interpret it with the meaning between parentheses and sometimes produce (301)
to express the same meaning. There is variation, therefore, in that one can choose to use a
cleft, (301), or not, (300). The structural similarity between these two clauses is
especially clear with negation because both clauses use ji-caa negation. In addition, the
interpretation suggests that these two clauses have the first elements focused, which
correlates ji-caa negation with the focus function of the cleft construction.",[198]
"One more point in terms of the structure of affirmative imperatives is that the
Imperfective Aspect can never appear in imperative sentences. In the following, I show
ungrammatical examples.",[275]
"46the study concludes that animacy, definiteness and phrase weight do not operate on the
pattern of word order in simple transitive clauses and that the basic word order of Iquito
is SVO. In deciding basic word order, this chapter considers sentences containing the
following characteristics: independent transitive clause, affirmative, realis mood and
active voice. In addition, the subject and the object have to be expressed and represented
in complete and full nominal phrases, for example, those including nouns as opposed to
pronouns. In Iquito, there is no agreement information (e.g. person, number, gender,
class, etc.) of grammatical arguments marking on the verb, and the alignment system,
based on word order, exhibits an accusative pattern. It is noted that although pronouns in
Iquito are not agreement inflection markers, they were excluded from the preliminary
stage of investigation and the following examples do not contain them. A sentence with
the basic word order is shown as in (1). As can be seen, the relative order among the
principal constituents in the clause is SVO.","[64, 65]"
