"12.2.1momu NegativeMomu is a simple negator when applied to verbal predicates. The form of
the negated verb is limited to perfective (unmarked) or imperfective-marked
stems. No additional modal marking can occur. Momu cannot be used with
progressive-marked forms or non-verbal predicates.

indicate that one disagrees with with someone else’s assertion, or to invert
the assertion of a prior utterance, as in (b). If the polarity of the clause
is already negative, though, the negative does not invert the assertion of a
prior clause, but rather reiterates it, as in (c).

Momu can also function as an emotional element, or exclamation. For instance, it can flag displeasure, as in (a), or surprise, as in (b). In these
uses, they do not invert assertions, but rather signal something about the
speaker’s position.

‘They will cook sago jelly!’bernard-christmasMomu also functions as a two-place predicate for “not having” (§11.10).
In notes by Baron (1984, p25) on Western Momu, the verb is nominalised
(or linked according to his glossing). This appears to indicate that originally, or independently for Western Momu, negation was or is treated as a
complement-taking predicate with a deverbal complement.

‘I did not go’12.2.2onfa Modal negativeAs a complement-taking predicate (§16) onfa takes a sentence-like complement with a broader range of inflectional possibilities than the negative
particle momu (§12.2.1). Sentential complements to the predicate are usually
marked by the oblique, functioning as a complementiser.
Onfa is used with non-verbal predicates (§11.9).","[441, 442, 443]"
"Depending on theclass of predicate of the sentential complement, combined they can express
non-equivalence (§11.9.1), negative attribution (§11.9.2) or negative location
(§11.9.3). Negative possession is expressed by the negative particle momu
functioning as a two place predicate (§11.10).
Momu lacks a means of negating specific entities within a clause such as
adverbs, quantifiers, or constituents (Payne, 1985). Nor are there lexical negatives to achieve this. Instead, this is usually achieved over multiple clauses,
with the relevant entity expressed as a predicate, and it is the predicate that
is negated.
So, for instance, a single clause translation of (roughly, as this is not
possible in English either) “I will tell a non-big story” or similar, is not
possible in Momu. Instead, such information must be spread over multiple
clauses, as in (12.49).

complement-taking predicate that incorporate negation into their semantics
(§16.1.10). For instance, efiyeni ‘not want’ (§16.1.4.2), kwobo ‘not know /
be ignorant of’ (§16.1.7), and titwer ‘forget’ (§16.1.7) all lexicalise negations
of positive counterparts (and bear no resemblance to them) .
The prohibitive inflection (§12.1.1.5) is used to indicate disallowed actions.
Three modal adverbs code negation. Biom ‘inability’ (§9.6.3) and bie
‘non-permission’ (§9.6.4) code negated modal values. A negated reciprocal
clause can be coded by a specially marked form of akfu ‘reciprocation’.
The directional and restrictive combine to form akfu=ti=s ‘unreciprocated’
(§10.2.2.3).","[443, 444]"
"408As these are the only examples of such TAM marking, and because there
are non-grammaticalised readings of the inanimate existential, further work
is necessary to clarify if these are actual examples of variation in the stance
predicate.
12.1.2.2=m onfa Modal negative predicateThe modal negative is a fixed form which takes no inflection.18 Variation
in the form of the sentential complement to the modal negative contributes
to the modal value. The complement to onfa may be a non-verbal predicate, in which case the predicate type determines the nature of the negation
(§11.9).19 The complement may also be a verbal predicate, in which case it
can be inflected for the imperfective, perfective, realis progressive, or volitional future (§12.1.2.3).
A plain unmarked (perfective) verbal stem with onfa conveys a meaning
roughly equivalent to a negation of the stance predicate (§12.1.2.1).20 That
is, the speaker uses the construction to indicate their stance on the matter as
being opposite (or diﬀerent) to the sentential predicate. Thus, the diﬀerence
between the form in (12.37) and a negative particle equivalent (fienu momu
‘It is not a lie’) is that the particle version is a statement of fact: it is not a
lie. The speaker knows or believes nothing of alternative possibilities. The
utterance in (12.37) is a response to disbelief.21

A verbal predicate of a complement to the modal negative can combine with
18The shape of onfa does not obviously indicate a verbal past but the marking of the
complement with the oblique =m does. Onfa may be related to the verb on ‘see’ with
the polar question marker =fa, but there is no compelling evidence for this.
19
In fact, for non-verbal predicates, onfa is the main form of negation.
20
In §12.1.2.1, I tentatively conclude that the stance predicate has a negated form
wu=momu ‘it is not the case that....’ The subtle meaning diﬀerence between this construction and use of onfa is certainly in need of further investigation, especially because
of the complementary stance qualities of onfa.

be used, as in (12.38).

bernard-reciprocals
Note that this is not the irrealis form of the progressive—it cannot be combined with the modal negative. Given that negation describes a “non real”
situation, the usual expectation might be that an irrealis or subjunctive
should be used (Payne, 1985), especially in the context of a formally subordinate clause (Palmer, 2001).22 Palmer (2001) argues that the role of the
subjunctive in a negated context is of expressing doubt on the part of the
speaker. It may be that because the speaker is asserting a stance or position
counter to another, the realis here indicates surety on the part of the speaker.
If the speaker instead wanted to express doubt, the irrealis progressive form
of the stance predicate would be used instead (§12.1.2.1).
12.1.2.3Negative permission or potentialThe sentential complement to the modal negative onfa can only be marked
for the volitional future. No other modal inflection can be used. The meaning
conveyed by this combination is one of (12.39a) negative permission or (b)
lack of potential.

22The context for the utterance in (12.38) is of Bernard describing a woman who in
the course of a video clip enters from outside the frame. The video plays, and stops, and
freezes on the first frame with the woman out of frame. Bernard then makes the utterance
(12.38). The woman is known to both of us, and in a sense is “present”—just not visible.","[436, 437, 438]"

cause-eﬀect serial verb constructions (§13.2.3) or have developed from serial

bernard-cassowary16.1.10Negative predicatesNegation via a CTP is a rare strategy amongst the world’s languages (Noonan,
2007, p144). Momu is a language where synchronically, one of the two negation strategies (onfa ‘modal negative’) is clearly a CTP.11 This predicate
codes propositional attitude (§16.1.2) and deontic modal predicates (§16.1.3)
depending on the form of the (verbally predicated) complement.
For non-verbal predicates in complements, the CTP onfa is the only
strategy for negative equation, attribution (shown in (16.32) below) and
location (§11.9). The other negator momu also functions as a two place
predicate to code negative possession (§11.10). Issues of scope and other
features related specifically to negation are discussed in §12.2.
11
There is some evidence that the second negation strategy (via the particle momu)
used to operate on a nominal clause as well (§12.2.1).",[573]

1.1The Momu language and its speakersThe Bewani Ranges are in the north-western corner of Papua New Guinea, in
Sandaun Province. They stretch from the border with West Papua eastward
to the Torricelli Ranges. At the eastern end of the Bewani ranges, there are
two strings of villages—one each on the northern and southern slopes. Momu
is spoken in these villages. An intricate web of tributaries flowing from the
ranges has created vast deltas on either side. Some maps indicate that the
language spreads north to the coast, but this is not the case. The villages are
spread out over a large area, with as little as an hour’s walk, but sometimes
up to two day’s walk between them. With so much distance, intermarriage
or other direct contact between the eastern-most and western-most villages
is unheard of.","[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"35911.1Structural overviewBefore examining each construction type individually, I discuss features common to them all.
A number of constructions in this section involve the combination of a
single noun phrase (the subject), and a predicating element drawn from a
word class outside of verbs, or a phrasal element. The word class or form
of the phrasal element determines the nature of the predication, be it equational, attributive, possessive, locational or purposive. Negation involves
either a complement-taking predicate that takes an entire clause as its complement, a final negative particle, or a lexical negative.
Common to all are a subject NP (§11.1.1). In §11.1.1.1 I discuss discourse
pragmatic factors that can make identifying the subject problematic. Also
common to all is the manner in which adverbs modify the predicate. In
§11.1.3 I discuss the position and nature of adverbial modification of nonverbal predicates.","[387, 388]"
"3.5.5Particles3.5.5.1ExclamationsThere is a broad range of exclamatory particles. These usually form singleword clauses. Arguably, the higher count of these in portions of direct reported speech are a secondary indictor that one is in fact dealing with reported
speech (cf. ‘emotional elements’ in De Roeck, 1994), often bookending the
portion of direct reported speech.

ayefo(yefe) ‘oh no!’
111(ye)nabiye ‘for sure!’ (direct calque of tp nau wanem)
sai(yire) ‘so’ (common start to a narrative)
3.5.5.2Question markersConstituent questions are formed with the addition of the marker =a at the
end of the clause (§10.3.2.3). There is also an emphatic marker -a with the
same form. Interrogative and emphatic marked clauses are only diﬀerentiated by intonation.

meta
pi-mu=a?
exclm 1sg how.do one.goes[1|3sgS]-vol.fut=q
‘Oh, where do I go from here?’picture-task-part3Polar (yes/no) questions are formed with the addition of a marker =fa at
the end of the clause (§10.3.2.1). Again, this is usually accompanied by a
rising sentence-final intonation.

2sg things

‘Did you just get the things?’
3.5.5.3steven-lukeNegative particle momuThe negative particle momu functions as a sentential negator (§12.2.1),27
as a negative possessive predicate (§11.10), and as negative response to a
question (§10.3.2).
3.5.5.4Representative coordinatorThe particle tya is a linker for constructing representative conjunction (Haspelmath, 2007a, p24). It functions as a linker of multiple items (3.43), but when
occurring on single items, it represents a plurality of those items, and items
similar to it (3.44).

‘That, perhaps, God might know.’steven-tumbunaThe perfective and volitional future forms of the stance predicate are far less
common across my corpus. Further investigation is necessary to understand
possible variation in the form of the complement to these forms, as not all
of the combinations otherwise seen with the irrealis progressive form of the
CTP (wuta) have been observed.
16.1.2.3=m onfa Modal negative predicateThe negated counterpart to the stance predicate is the ‘modal negative’
onfa. As with the positive counterparts, only the oblique is used as a complementiser. Viewpoint aspect can be marked on the complement. If the
complement is in the progressive then only the realis form is used.

‘The man hadn’t been walking around.’2008.396For verbal predicates, there is a contrast between simple negation as expressed by the stance coding onfa, and simple negation by momu, as shown

5352008.396Complements marked by the volitional future code a propositional attitude
layered over a deontic modal (§16.1.3). Non-verbal predicates of complements to onfa code simple negation (§11.9) rather than negated stance.
Both stance and its negated counterpart only allow realis progressive
complements. This strikes at the heart of the modal nature of these constructions in the terms that I defined for modality in §12 (i.e., that Modality
is a consideration of alternatives). While it may seem odd that a realis form
applies to a negated proposition (i.e., to something that isn’t so), it is in
the diﬀerence between the negation types that the reason for this becomes
clear. In the examples above, the perfective complement to onfa in (16.12a)
indicates that speaker asserts that a past state of aﬀairs did not hold, and
hints or implies the alternative: that this state of aﬀairs holds presently, or
perhaps in the future. The plain negated form in (16.12b) is less nuanced.
A past or present state of aﬀairs doesn’t hold, and no implication is made
about the present or future. Given such an explanation of onfa, employing
a realis progressive within the complement makes sense.
A realis progressive complement to onfa indicates that a state that the
speakers know to be relevant doesn’t hold at the moment of utterance. Such
an utterance implies, however, that it shortly will be so. In the example
below, the speaker is anticipating that what isn’t initially true at the time
will become so when the video he is describing progresses.7
(16.13) Bernard describes a video where he knows that the first referent in
this example is initially out of frame.

7Such constructions as that seen in (16.13) are hard to stumble upon naturally, let
alone reliably elicit. Further work is necessary to fully understand this form, including,
for instance, whether an implied inversion as a past state can be read into the form.","[562, 563, 564]"
"11.11Other negativesThe two negation strategies discussed above (§11.9, §11.10) do not form negative counterparts to all positive strategies. Here I briefly examine additional
negating strategies and areas where negation is unclear or unavailable.
The status of negated purposive predicates is unclear, but (11.45) may
be an example.13

ambiguous in tp as well: bilong is both a marker of possession and purpose.",[407]

A third source of other non-verbal predications is subordinate clauses including adverbial clauses and relative clauses. We saw above that purposive
clauses can function as predicates. Temporal adverbial clauses (§15.3) can
also function as predicates, as shown in (11.38a)9 to (c).10 In (d) the predicate is a relative clause.11

9(11.38a) includes a copula use of the existential verb (§11.12.3).
Predicative adverbial clauses are rare. The example in (11.38c) is not ideal because
it is disrupted by a parenthetical question.
11
The examples in (11.38) are all identificational. Stassen (1997) argues that these are
not predicative, or at least that they are not predicative in the sense applied to other
predicates in this chapter.
10376Finally, there is a range of minor phrasal construction types that serve as nonverbal predicates. For instance, the phrase fes eru ‘that’s all’ is commonly
used to indicate that a story is finished. Although the demonstrative eru
‘that’ can be identified, fes does not stand alone, and I have not encountered
it in another scenario. In the example below it combines with the subject
NP mony to ‘my story’.
(11.39) Ating

whether the predicate is verbal or otherwise. The “modal negative” 12 onfa
is verb-like in that it takes a single oblique-marked complement. The other
negator is the two-place predicate momu (§12.2). Because the modal negative takes a clause as its complement, the range of possible clause types that
can be negated using it is broader. The negative predicate momu, on the
other hand, only expresses negative possession.","[403, 404, 405]"
"35510.3.3ImperativeImperatives in Momu are coded by inflection on verbs. I restrict the present
analysis of imperatives to the traditional conception of the imperative as
a category only applying to second person referents (König and Siemund,
2007). I do, however, briefly mention some other strategies at the end of this
section (§10.3.3.2) for imperative-like meanings (many of which extend beyond second person referents). The negative imperative is treated separately
in the context of modality and negation (§12.1.1.5).
10.3.3.1Positive imperativeThe positive imperative is marked by two variants, coding singular and plural
imperative.
(10.50) gives examples of singular imperatives. The singular imperative
is marked either by -e or -a.22
(10.50) (a) Ay=ne,
pin-e!
2sg=foc one.goes-sg:imp
‘As for you, go!’
(b) Ken-a!
extinguish-sg:imp
‘Shut up!’ma-frog-story(c) yine!
come:sg:imp
‘come!’2008.400Yine ‘come sg:imp’ in (c) is a suppletive form of pwen ‘one comes’.23
(10.51) gives examples of the plural imperative. The plural imperative is
marked by -am.
(10.51) (a) A=m
na-pwen-am!
here=obl many.-come-pl:imp
‘Come here!’2008.40022
While not always consistent, and for some speakers, freely variable, the allophone -e
appears to harmonise with a prior high vowel, and -a with non-high vowels.
23
I treat the whole form yine as suppletive rather than separating oﬀ the final vowel
and treating the root as stem alternation because I have not found this root to be able to
stand independently of the final vowel.","[383, 384]"
"16.1.2Propositional attitude predicatesPropositional attitude predicates are similar to utterance predicates in that
there is a transference of information. In addition to this, the speakers
attitude towards the veracity of that information is expressed.
In Momu, the attitude towards the information can be coded as neutral
or negative, on the basis of the form of the complementiser. A neutral or
favourable attitude by the speaker towards the proposition is coded by the
oblique complementiser case =m, and a skeptical attitude is coded by the
restrictive complementiser =s.
All complements to propositional attitude predicates precede the CTP,
indicating that these are more syntactically integrated than complements to
utterance predicates.
The complements are sentence-like (§16.6), and allow for the marking of
viewpoint aspect (§7.1). Modal marking is not allowed, except for some complements which can be marked with the volitional future, usually marking
asserted desire, intention or obligation.4 Some complements discussed here
can be non-verbally predicated.
16.1.2.1=m/s yeni ‘I say (assert/think)’The personally held belief of the speaker is commonly asserted with the
speech verb yeni with a pre-predicative complement. The oblique =m as
a complementiser indicates a neutral attitude by the speaker, as in (16.9a),
and the restrictive =s indicates a skeptical attitude, as in (b). Nominally
predicated and volitional-future-marked complements are possible. The progressive matches the complementiser: the realis form couples with complements marked by the oblique and the irrealis form couples with complements
marked by the restrictive.
4See also §16.1.3 for deontic modal predicates.",[561]

"388Chapter 12Modality and Negation
“Modality is about alternatives—how we come to know and speak
about the world, how the world came to be as it is, whether it
might be other than it is, what needs to be done to the world to
make it what we want.” Timberlake (2007)
This chapter is about the grammatical means of expression of alternatives.
In this spirit, it includes the expression of negation (§12.2)—what Timberlake (2007, p316) characterises in a footnote as “a pure operator of modality”.
Modality marking hints at alternatives, and by inverting a proposition, negation presents a possibility but asserts its opposite. While modality and
negation are grouped together here in the one chapter, I do however treat
them as separate topics, with significant points of overlap.
Modal categories relating to sentence types such as the imperative (§10.3.3)
are treated separately in §10.3. A subset of adverbs indicate modal categories; these are briefly reviewed in §9.6. Some construction types involving
these adverbs overlap in function with the modal categories discussed in this
chapter.","[416, 417]"
"379Attribution and possession predicates formed with the proprietive marker
=bu cannot be negated. Instead, a diﬀerent strategy altogether is pursued.
For instance, the negative counterpart to (c11.24) tene mubu ‘I am married
(lit. I have a woman)’ would be the verbally predicated form in (11.46).
(11.46) Te mu
nai
momu.
1sg woman marry[1sgS] neg
‘I haven’t married.’
As noted in (§11.8) there is a lexical negative counterpart to the predicate
nominal kamefe/kamey ‘know,’ kwobo ‘not know.’ As with ‘know,’ this is a
one- or two-place predicate (§16.1.10).","[407, 408]"
"3179.6Modal adverbsThere are a handful of modal or modal-like meanings expressed by adverbial
forms.
Activities that persist counter to expectation are marked with the adverb mo ‘ yet/still’ (9.6.1). Attempts and inability are expressed by modal
adverbs. Common to these modal adverbs is oblique (=m) marking, fused
into the form of (fe)sim ‘attempt to’ (§9.6.2) but synchronically separable
from bio(m) ‘inability’ (§9.6.3). Negative permission is coded by the adverb
bie (§9.6.4).
In some cases these modal adverbs are the only way of expressing such
means, in other case they are complementary to existing modal marking
which is primarily achieved via marking on the verb (§12.1.1), or via “modal
predicates” (§12.1.2).","[345, 346]"
"53616.1.2.4on SeemsA restrictive-marked complement to on ‘see’ is used to express ‘seems’, a
common semantic extension (Evans and Wilkins, 2000). That is, to put
forward a proposition for which the speaker has weak confidence in its veracity. As with other propositional attitude predicates, the combination with
a restrictive-marked complement indicates a skeptical or unfavourable attitude on the part of the speaker. This is the only choice of complementiser
with this CTP for this reading. On is also a CTP for expressing acquisition
of knowledge (§16.1.7) and for immediate perception, but note that for these
uses a diﬀerent complement type and position is employed.

‘He possibly is unable to come.’2008.426Counter to the predictions of Noonan (2007), complements to this class are
neither reduced nor subjunctive in Momu. Instead it is an unreduced form
of the complement, and specifically, the marking of the volitional future that
signals a deontic meaning. In Momu such a meaning cannot be achieved
without being embedded within a propositional attitude predicate. The
deontic component is not being coded by the CTP, and so this should be
considered a variation from a propositional attitude predicate, not a separate
CTP type.","[564, 565, 566]"
"627C.2The modal inflection -mamuThere is an inflection -mamu which I presume to be some kind of modal
marking. It clearly exists in older texts but is longer in use in the area where
I conducted fieldwork. Here I simply compile all the information that is
available on the form.
I suspect that this form was formerly the interrogative or subjunctive
counterpart to the volitional future. I presume that the volitional future has
subsumed this function (in combination with interrogative marking, §10.3.2),
which has rendered -mamu redundant. In the absence of any further data,
I base this hypothesis on the (former) parallel relationship between the epistemic future (in the declarative) and hypothetical future (in the interrogative) (see §12.1.1, and especially Table 12.1 on page 392).
This form appears sporadically throughout the older Global Recordings
Network texts (§1.5, §2.6.2) from 1973. While not expanding upon it, or
giving any examples, Baron (1984) also lists the form amongst the others
discussed here in his unpublished grammar notes.9
In the instances from the Global Recordings Network text “rich-fool”, uses
include setting up unreal possibilities like that in (C.15a). Synchronically,
speakers of eastern Momu use the hypothetical future -me (§12.1.1.3) for such
a construction. In (b) the utterances have a roughly subjunctive flavour, but
the translation of this section of the text was diﬃcult for my informants.10
(c) shows that -mamu could be used with the modal negative onfa (§12.1.2.2,
§12.2.2), which heavily restricts modal marking otherwise.11 In this way it
is similarly as flexible as the volitional future -mu (§12.1.1.1).

9Baron groups the form with the volitional future -mu, and correspondingly groups the
epistemic future and hypothetical future together. Given that the relationship between
the epistemic future and hypothetical future is of roughly complementary distribution
across declarative and interrogative uses, by analogy -mamu might have corresponded to
interrogative use. Synchronically the volitional future is used in both domains, however.
10
The text appears to deviate from the Tok Pisin transcript used for these texts (GRN,
2015). As such I am also unable to contextualise the prompts for the utterances in (C.15b).
11
Synchronically, the meaning expressed in (C.15c) (inability) would be achieved with
the volitional future in combination with the modal negative.","[655, 656]"

The form may occur in sentential complements to some complementtaking predicates, but only in postposed complements. In terms of grammaticalisation towards an inflection, this is an intermediate point between
a modal inflection and a separate complement-taking predicate. Preposed
complements show the highest degree of syntactic integration in Momu while
postposed ones can often be taken to be paratactic (§16.6).

of alternatives as the ultimate alternative: the opposite. Negation is a universal feature of language, with coding being via a verb (or predicate), particle
or adverb (Payne, 1985). In Momu, negation is primarily coded via a particle
momu (§12.2.1) or a negating predicate onfa (§12.2.2). There are few alternatives available for coding negation in Momu (§12.2.3).","[440, 441]"
"10.3.1DeclarativeDeclarative clauses are used to assert or report states of aﬀairs. These include
complaints, bragging, predicting and promising (König and Siemund, 2007).
Declaratives in Momu are the default, unmarked sentence type. There
is no specific marking, however the emphatic markers -e and -a are possibly a component of certain sub-types of declarative speech-acts. Further
investigation is necessary.
Declaratives generally take an (unmarked) rising-falling intonation contour over a simple clause type. However, as with every generalisation, there
are exceptions. Complex clause types such as coordinated structures have
more complex intonation patterns. In §10.3.2.4 I briefly review declaratives
with parenthetical questions mixed in. There is also a marked post-posed
participant strategy where the predicate has a terminal contour, and the
post-posed element has a marked rising contour (§8.1.3).1610.3.2InterrogativeInterrogative sentences are sentences typically intended as a request for information from an interlocutor. Interrogative sentences in Momu include
polar questions, where the veracity of an assertion is being sought, and constituent questions where content relating to constituents are being sought.
A reply to a polar question might be yo ‘yes’ or momu ‘no’, or something
in between.17 A constituent question (§10.3.2.3) involves a question word
(§3.5.3). A reply to such a question might minimally be the sought-after
constituent, or may mirror portions of the question as well. The example
below includes both a constituent and polar question. The first sentence
16There are definitely extra-clausal post-posed participants (topical afterthought), but
the pattern described is in addition to this. Further investigation is necessary to confirm
it however.
17
Between the absolute poles of true and false, replies can be epistemic in nature (e.g.,
aisena ‘who knows? / maybe’, or a form of the epistemic stance marker (§12.1.2.1)), or
even a question in return.",[377]

"16.3.1Valence and CTPsFor Momu, few CTPs fill a core argument with a complement. Arguably the
most syntactically integrated complements fill the sole argument position for
the CTP. Most propositional attitude predicates (§16.1.2) (and associated
deontic interpretations, §16.1.3) are one-place predicates; namely the stance
predicate (§16.1.2.2), the modal negative (§16.1.2.3) and the ‘seems’ CTP
(§16.1.2.4). Commentatives coding judgements, as expressed by attributive
predicates, are also one-place predicates (§16.1.6.2). Such CTPs tend to
show the greatest degree of grammaticalisation.",[575]

languages (Reesink, 1993). Further testing is necessary, but in Momu, this

sense, but in some cases a desiderative sense appears to be a better translation.8 I consider this form to be a partial predicate, being half way between
an independent predicate and a fully grammaticalised inflection. The form
is not phonologically independent and has fused with the complementiser.
No inflection is available except for subject marking.
The form of the complement is a bare verb stem (§16.6.1) whose position
is strictly prior to the CTP. Subject marking on the CTP must agree with

kaspar-kokomo12.1.2Modal predicatesModal predicates express a variety of modal qualities that operate over
the entire clause. All forms are more or less complement-taking predicates
(Noonan, 2007), some of which have fused or reduced. All show a degree of
402grammaticalisation (§16.3.2), either by a reduction in form or a reduction in
inflectional possibilities.
The components of these constructions in Momu are a sentence-like complement, a complementiser, and a complement-taking predicate (henceforth
the modal predicate). All three have variable forms across the construction
types discussed below.
12.1.2.1=m wu Stance predicateThe inanimate existential verb wu has grammaticalised as a form of epistemic
stance marking which I label (and gloss) the ‘stance predicate.’ The form
encodes the speaker’s subjective assessment of the state-of-aﬀairs described
by the complement, relative to a temporal oﬀset established by inflection on
the predicate.
Stance is a broad and varied topic across the literature (see Engelbretson
(2007) for an overview of diﬀerent approaches), but here I am singling out
just one component of stance. Following Engelbretson (2007) I take stance
to be a subjective, observable, interactional, indexical and consequential
phenomenon. As such, many examples of the stance predicate occur in
dialogic, natural and unscripted interactions between speakers, especially in
tasks like the social cognition picture task (San Roque et al., 2012), where
the speakers in one phase of the task are jointly attending to constructing
a narrative based on a series of images. Amongst possible instantiations of
stance, here the stance predicate codes mainly epistemic stance. Stance can
also code emotional attitudes and judgements of a given proposition. Such
meanings are coded by other complement-taking predicates in Momu, and
are examined elsewhere (§16.1).
In the simple exchange below, two speakers are working towards identifying the unknown elements in an image.13 Monica signals her tentative
position with the stance predicate in (d).

without progressing the identification by simply parroting it back in (b) and (c).","[428, 429, 430, 431]"

‘I know (that) you want to go.’2012.66Imperfective marking is possible with the stance predicate as well. The
realis–irrealis distinction in the progressive (§7.4) is layered with the progressive form of the stance predicate. Only the realis form can be used for
the sentential complement, and only the irrealis form is used for the stance
predicate.
The realis progressive form in the complement in (12.34a) is used when
the speaker subjectively asserts a current and ongoing state of aﬀairs as
probable. The imperfective in (b) expresses past imperfective, and this is
given a modal flavour by the irrealis form of the stance predicate. The irrealis
progressive (ai- V -ta) and the stative form ( V -ta) cannot be used in the
complement.

407Core aspectual distinctions like directional inflection appear to be unrestricted in the complement, but further investigation is needed.16
Finally, I tentatively include some additional examples here that may fall
under stance.
A negated form of the stance predicate is shown in (12.35). Further
investigation is necessary, including comparison to an extremely similar use
of the modal negative (§12.1.2.2). The repetition of momu in (12.35b) is
clearer as a stance-like usage. The speaker weakens his conviction as the two

The examples in (12.36) demonstrate marking of the stance predicate with
the rare apprehensive marker -ma (12.36a).17 (12.36b) demonstrates a potential stance predicate in the realis progressive, but this is possibly just a
non-grammaticalised use of the inanimate existential. If it is stance, then
this is a confident assertion on the part of the speaker, but one that is being
put forward as an opinion nonetheless.

a limited amount of natural discourse. Elicitation of variation in form has so far been
problematic as it can be diﬃcult to set up the right context for some forms. Again, further
investigation is necessary. The social cognition picture task was especially helpful in
unearthing identificational examples of stance as the pictures are deliberately inconsistent
so as to force negotiation of identity between speakers (San Roque et al., 2012).

The form -mene is mostly used for prohibition, but appears to extend to

In addition to contrasting over sentence types, these forms interact significantly with the person of the subject (Lehmann, 2009). The modal inflections are also heavily restricted in subordinating contexts. A restricted set
of modal markers can combine with modal predicates. These are considered
separately in the context of modal predicates (§12.1.2).

Given that the volitional future occurs in both declarative and non-declarative contexts, but the epistemic future and hypothetical future are instead limited to declarative
and non-declarative contexts respectively, it is possible that -mamu is a remnant of a
former contrast between the volitional future and -mamu, such that -mamu was used in
non-declarative contexts, and the volitional future was formerly restricted to declarative
contexts. Further investigation is necessary, but for this reason, -mamu is placed in the
non-declarative section of Table 12.1.","[419, 420]"

In translating this form, speakers used both the Tok Pisin future marker bai

When used with a third person subject, the speaker indicates that they
believe that the agent wants or intends to carry out the action. In (12.7) two

A -mu marked clause is future-oriented with respect to a certain temporal origo, which is understood to be the time of utterance by default,
though other readings are possible in context. There are no grammaticalised
means in Momu for explicitly indicating the time of the predicated event or
state relative to the moment of speech. Instead, that time is constructed,
understood or inferred by the speaker from the context of the utterance. As
such, in the right circumstances, the matrix-level clause marked with the
volitional future can be understood to be indicating a past desire (fulfilled
or otherwise).
In the exchange (constructed in elicitation) below, two people discuss
shooting a captive pig. Speaker A establishes that someone has already
done this. In their response, speaker B uses Teb niymu ‘I wanted to shoot
it.’ In the context, that is understood as a non-future reference time.

These are sometimes marked as volitional acts, particularly in those cases
where the outcome is unfortunate for someone.

limited amount of modal inflection, the volitional future is the most common
inflection allowed. Amongst predicates taking sentential complements, the
modal complement-taking predicates are of particular interest when combined with the volitional future. The combination of the modal negative
and volitional future expresses inability (§12.1.2.2). The combination of the
stance predicate and volitional future expresses desire or necessity, while the
stance predicate provides the overall modal and temporal frame (§12.1.2.1).
12.1.1.2-meta Epistemic futureThe “epistemic future” marker -meta indicates possible events, outside the

Most lexemes have low semantic density. In terms of exponence, typically
only one or two categories are encoded in a single morpheme. Subject or
object are always combined with number. The multipart progressive (§7.4.2)
includes a deictic distinction in the realis form (§7.4.2). As part of the
progressive, and other constructions, nominalisation and subject marking
are fused into portmanteau morphs (§16.5.1.1). On nominals, the genitive is
combined with number (4.8.5).
Like many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea, the basic word
order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V (Dryer, 2007b, 2011) or simply
verb-final (Foley, 1986, p10). In Momu, all participants in a clause typically
occur before the verb and observe a fixed ordering (§8.1.3).35 Nominal heads
are post-modified (§5.1) excepting nouns modifying other nouns (§14.1.2),
adpositions are postpositive (§3.5.1, §9.1) and relational and adnominal case
marking is post-positive, upon dependents (§4.8.1). This is in line with
the general expectation for S(O)V languages. Possession is variably marked
(§4.8.5): small closed nominal classes include genitive- (pronouns, §3.5.2) or
possessive-marking (possessed kin, §4.6.2). Genitive phrases can freely occur
before or after the head that they modify (§4.8.5.2). Inalienable possession
(relating to body parts and houses) can be unmarked (§14.1.2.4), and is often
externally possessed (§10.2.1).
In “tight” verb or verb phrase coordination (i.e., serial verb constructions,
§13), the final verb is usually the prominent host of inflectional categories.
In looser coordinative structures, each predicating verb may host inflectional
categories. Manner is most commonly indicated by serial verbs (§13.2.1), but
small sets of adverbial forms also occur in a similar (preverbal) position in
the clause (§9.4, §9.3.1, §9.3.1).
All adverbial subordinators occur on the right edge of the clause (§15),
some both pre-modify and post-modify main clauses (often with a diﬀerence in meaning), while others are fixed on one or the other order. Nominal
modifying subordinate clauses occur in the same position as other lexical
modifiers, after the head (§15.1, §15.8). Complementisers also occur after
the dependent clause (§16.2). Depending on the complement-taking predic35Verb-final order is not strictly so, like in languages like Ku Waru (Merlan and Rumsey,
1991). There is a (seemingly increasingly common) pattern of postposing a single nonsubject participant after the verb which should not be considered topical afterthought
(§8.1.3). Certainly though, the dominant word order is clearly S(O)V.","[55, 56]"

In this section, I examine diﬀerent types of non-verbal predications. This
includes lexical non-verbal forms like nominals and adverbs and phrasal elements like noun phrases and adverbial clauses, all of which function as predicates of clauses in Momu.
The major classes of non-verbal predications common cross-linguistically
include those that express equation, attribution, location and possession
(Dryer, 2007a; Payne, 1997; Stassen, 1997). All are expressed via nonverbal predicates in Momu, but attribution and location also have verbally
predicated counterparts or can be linked by a copula (§11.12).
The juxtaposition of noun phrases is used to express equational meanings
(§11.2.1). There are also a number of juxtapositions where the function of the
predicate is indicated by adnominal case marking. There are two negating
strategies (§11.9): a general negating strategy for negated equation (§11.9),
attribution (§11.9.2) and location (§11.9.3), and another strategy for lack of
possession (§11.10). Lexical negatives, verbal or non-verbal, are not common
in Momu.
While the title of this chapter implies a division between verbal and
non-verbal predicates, the reality is somewhat more of a cline. In the final
subsection (§11.12), I look at instances where the predicate sits between
nominal and verbal form. In this section I note where non-verbal predicates
have verbal counterparts, and where there is no verbal counterpart.","[384, 385, 386, 387]"

Morphologically, the deictic distinction is two-way, but if one includes the
irrealis progressive construction, the distinction across the progressive is actually three-way. By locating the participants in an event, the speaker (or
asserted knowledge holder) is indicating that in knowing where they are,
they have reason to hold that knowledge as real. In situations where this is
not the case, the speaker must use the irrealis form of the progressive.
Making an inflectional deictic distinction on verbs is unusual but not
unheard of. More commonly aﬃxal deictic distinctions might be considered
cliticised adverbial form, for instance, a rich system of spatial distinctions
including proximity which in some way aﬃx to the verb is not uncommon
in North American languages. For example, in Kwakwala, amongst a large
inventory of suﬃxes which “reflect the natural environment in which the
language is spoken” there is a suﬃx -em̀ ‘nearby’ which indicates proximity
(Mithun, 2001, p149). However, unlike the distinction required in the Momu
progressive, these are not obligatory categories. The Papuan language Berik
makes a two way distinction on verbs between an unmarked activity and
verbs marked with -tet to indicate that the activity occurred at some distance
(Westrum, 1988, p153).10
Diachronically, the Momu distinction is possibly closer to a grammaticalisation of motion verbs (§C.4). In the North American language Nez
10Berik also marks the spatial distinction of relative height (Westrum, 1988).","[284, 285]"
"25glides. Mid-high vowels are pulled higher by a neighbouring glide (§2.1.4.2),
resulting in a diphthong or phonetic long high vowel. There are no noncomplex high vowels in Momu.
The glides are fragile. In the absence of an adjacent vowel, they are either
devoiced or deleted. Glides aﬀect the surface realisation of both consonants
and vowels (§2.1.3) by palatalising or labialising consonants and raising or
rounding vowels. Glides occupy a special position in the phonotactics of
Momu as well. The ideal basic syllable (§2.4) has a preferred linear ordering of consonant-glide-vowel. In some combinations of morphology where a
final glide meets an initial consonant, this preference triggers metathesis to
generate the preferred ordering of segments (§2.5.1.1). More generally, nonmeaningful metathesis of consonants is a reasonably common occurrence in
Momu, so much so that it initially obscured a genetic aﬃliation with Baibai
(§1.1.1).
Momu is somewhat analytic, with concatenative morphology mostly occurring in the domain of verbs (§6).29 There is a single nonlinear formative
indicating third person singular subjects via ablaut: a rounding operation
of the right edge of a stem (§2.5.1.3). This leads to phonologically driven
syncretism when there is no suitable candidate for rounding,30 as first person singular subjects are the unmarked form of verbs (i.e., zero-marked).
Multiple morphological processes form verbs (§6.3). Diﬀerent sets contain
diﬀerent patterns of syncretism (§6.4). Some transitive verb-forming sets incorporate object marking (§6.3.3.1) and some form transitive verbs without
object marking (§6.3.3.2, §6.3.3.3). Although verb formation is common,
there are also many monomorphemic verbs (i.e., free roots).
Word forming strategies create verbs with selectional properties that pattern on an absolutive basis (i.e., the aﬀected participant). Reasonably common amongst verbs is a pattern of stem alternation such that two diﬀerent
verbs select for the number of an argument along absolutive lines (i.e., verbal
number, §6.6).31 In fact, the ratio of verbal number pairs to other verbs in
29The average verb is very commonly unmarked (usually indicating first singular subject
and perfective categories), but most commonly will be marked for subject cross-reference,
aspectual and or modal categories via a single morpheme in a single slot for each of these
three.
30
Syncretism of first and third person singular subjects is essentially driven by the lack
of a rounding candidate on consonant-final roots. In glossing, these are readily identifiable
in examples throughout this thesis as they have an inferred gloss of “either first or third
person singular subject” ([1|3sgS]).
31
In grammar writing, this pattern is very commonly referred to as “suppletive number”26Momu exists at the upper end of what is typologically evident at this point
in time (Corbett, 2000). As such, most commonly the stems are regularly
derived (§6.5, §6.6.2.3), while a minority are represented by completely diﬀerent (§6.6.2.1) or partially recognisable forms (§6.6.2.1). Some word-forming
“aspectual suﬃxes” (§7.5.2) also pattern on an absolutive basis. A directional
suﬃx indicates the location or path of an aﬀected participant (§7.5.2.1), and
the incompletive suﬃx indicates the state of completeness of the aﬀected
participant (§7.5.2.4).32
Momu has large open classes of verbs and nominals, with small closed
subclasses within them. Nominals have minimal inflectional categories, mostly
of the dependent marking kind (§4.8), outside of small closed classes like
pronouns (§3.5.2), or possessed kin terms (§4.6.2). The verbs are really the
powerhouse of the language, especially in the context of extremely common
elision of topical referents. As such, it is not uncommon for clauses to almost
entirely consist of sequences of verbs (§13).
Momu has a nominative-accusative system of agreement. A basic relational case system diﬀerentiates subjects from non-subject arguments via
an oblique case marker, which also marks most other kinds of non-subject
(§4.8.2, §8.1.2). Subjects are nearly always cross-indexed on verbs (§6.2.1,
§8.2.1), objects less so (§8.2.2).33 Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal,
with many intransitive predicates coded by non-verbal forms (§11). Transitive predicates are almost exclusively coded by verbs. There is a single pair
of ditransitive verbs: no/tu ‘give one/many’ (§3.1.2.3). Momu employs existential verbs as copulas (§11.12.3) and only in this very restricted case does
one find irregular word orders, and a diﬀerently coded subject (§8.2.1).34
Considering the other inflectional categories of verbs, Momu possesses a
classic viewpoint aspect system of the kind where perfectives are unmarked
(§7.2) and imperfectives are marked (§7.3). Modal categories are suﬃxed on
verbs (§12.1.1), and there also exists a small set of “modal predicates”, the
majority of which concern epistemic stance (§12.1.2). Negation is marked on
clauses via a final particle (§12.2.1) or typologically uncommon complementor “number suppletion”. For the reasons I lay out in §6.6, I will not be continuing this
tradition here.
32
Aspectual suﬃxes are primarily concerned with the internal structure of the event.
33
Variation in the treatment of objects is both common and clear enough in Momu to
be treated as a split (8.2.2).

The split in the coding of subjects is not significant enough to justify labelling it as a
“split subject”, however.","[53, 54, 55]"

doesn’t know exactly where, hence the proximal form can be used. More
commonly, such a question would require the speaker to use an irrealis progressive form, like afta ‘you are (location unknown)’ shown below, which

the question marker =a. There are two sets of question words, based on
their form, either starting with b (b-set) or m (m-set). The question words
are distributed unevenly across the two sets. A subset of the question words
can be used as modifiers to a nominal to form a selective sense (§3.5.3).
The question word byeku ‘what’ (or beku/b(y)oku) fills the constituent
position, with the appropriate relational case, to question the identity of
a referent. In (a) the subject is initial and unmarked. In (b), the themeoblique is marked with the oblique case. In (c) the instrument-oblique is

developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. These became
an invaluable source of exploration while on fieldwork.
While back at the ANU, a weekly “grammar group” became a platform
for a group of junior and senior grammar writers to discuss the grammar
of a broad range of languages and a broad range of topics. This group was
particularly formative for me, both in the exposure to other ways of looking
at the same problems that had developed in localised traditions of grammar writing,25 and in presenting arguments about grammatical structures
in Momu and in other grammars and typological papers in an environment
where they could be dissected by many interested minds. It was a fascinating
insight into typological variation, thanks to the many languages represented.
It was also an excellent avenue for discussion of just what a “grammar of a
language” could or should be.
When it comes to situating Momu in the linguistic world, I have tried my
best to describe the language in its own terms. In particular, I have tried to
strike a balance between the use of abstract representations of structure, and
long form prose as two tools that aid in modelling structure and expounding
meaning. My approach to grammar writing is, I think, unconsciously influenced by R. M. W. Dixon, who in turn had an influence on the generation
of grammar writing linguists in Australia by whom I was taught. Dixon
himself has named his approach as “Basic Linguistic Theory”, however, I am
reluctant to use the term. I believe that theoretical frameworks are models
that more or less fit a problem at hand. I very much agree with Dryer (2006)
that I am engaging with descriptive theory, rather than explanatory theory.
It is enough for me to attempt to answer the question of “what languages
are like” without being caught up in why.
There is very little literature or data available for languages putatively related to Momu, and so a diachronic consideration of Momu cannot incorporate a thorough application of the comparative method until some substantial
work has been done on the languages spoken around Momu. However, I tend
25For instance, the Oceanic tradition of grammar writing is very much grounded in
or perhaps served by the reconstruction of Proto-Oceanic. But also, the terminology,
distinctions and assumptions around broadly evident features of Oceanic languages are
assumed by insiders but at times opaque to outsiders. I don’t mean to single out Oceanic
languages here—discussing other languages and language families with other grammar
writers in the grammar group made it clear that this was very broadly the case for other
language families as well.","[49, 50]"
"33910.2.2.2Lexical reciprocalsThere is a nominal form akfu glossed as ‘reciprocate’ or ‘reciprocation’ in the
examples below. Akfu is likely the combination of the reciprocal-emphatic
particle ak and -fu, an inflection found in some kin nouns, and for indicating
sister exchange marriage referents (§4.7).
Akfu is used to construct “weak”, “negated” and “non-simultaneous” reciprocal meanings (König and Gast, 2008). In particular, akfu is used in constructing multi-clausal reciprocal constructions (Evans, 2008), as discussed
in the section following this one.
Some basic negative-reciprocal uses of akfu are given in (10.21). There
are three negating strategies involving akfu. In (a) the lack-of-possession
predicate momu (§4.6.2) is used.14 In (b) the modal predicate onfa (§11.9)
is used to negate an identificational use of akfu.15 In (c) restrictive marking
on akfu indicates that an action performed was done without reciprocation.

‘I saw him, but he in turn did not see me.’2008.470I have yet to discover other forms which lexicalise specific acts of reciprocation (e.g., English kiss or marry). The verb seyen ‘exchange marriage’
does appear to lexicalise a reciprocal event (or an event with the strong
cultural expectation of reciprocation). Examples are discussed in the next
section.
A curious example is given in (10.22) which roughly describes a reciprocal
act, without the use of any of the markers described above. The verb soi
‘deal out / distribute’ is used to describe the (normally) non-reciprocal act

A positive counterpart to (10.21b) using an identificational strategy (§11.2.1) would
be anu akfu ‘this is reciprocation.’340of a subject dealing out food or other items to a group of people. A simple
example is given in (10.22a). The verb does not index T or G arguments,
but I have analysed it as transitive where the O is the theme, given that the
verb does not take object prefixes. In (b) the verb is transitivised to add a
recipient (G), and the meaning shifts to that of exchange.

10.2.2.3Multi-clausal reciprocalsAkfu can also signal a reciprocal action with looser temporal structure. Here
I survey several uses of the form in multi-clausal constructions. Akfu means
‘in reciprocation, in turn’ in these constructions, and accompanies a one-way
action embedded in a larger discourse containing reciprocation.
(10.23) starts by describing a basic event without reciprocation: yime eru
mu erum memam sakyetuw ‘The man wipes the woman’s cheek.’ Subsequent
reciprocal actions are then marked by akfu either clause-initially or preceding
the predicate.

the absence of reciprocated action.

In (10.25), Yarin describes an event which naturally expects reciprocation:
marriage exchange. The first act of giving a wife is described as a nonreciprocal event bamo yeb seyen ‘he gave his sister.’ To indicate that a
reciprocal act was performed, Yarin says seyeba, akfu eru yeb seyen ‘when
he (Wunku) gave her, he (Oimnefi) then gave back in reciprocation.’ Yarin
finishes reiterating the content of these clauses by using the reciprocal construction involving the reciprocal-emphatic ak and the reciprocal use of ta
‘do’.

(10.26) is a description of an event as a “chaining of relations” (König and
Gast, 2008). People stand in a line and perform the same action (shaking
hands) in turn going down the line. These kinds of events are not explicitly
marked as reciprocal in Momu. As the activity moves down the chain, the
fact that a diﬀerent individual is brought into the overall event is flagged
342with afa ‘(an)other/one.’ In the middle of (10.26), akfu does code a weak
form of reciprocal action. Interestingly, akfu can be used to code a nonequivalent act performed in reciprocation. Yime eru akfu yinu ian ‘the man
smiles back’ is used to indicate that the smile is made in response to a hand
shake.

10.2.2.4Parallel-reciprocal constructionsA second, looser strategy exists in coordination of clauses indicating parallel
action (§14.2.6). Subjects are marked with sisy ‘also’ in this coordination
type. The parallel actions, where directed at each other, can be interpreted
as reciprocal.

monica-reciprocals10.2.3Reflexive constructionsReflexive constructions describe an activity where an agent or experiencer
collapse in reference with the patient of a clause (Kemmer, 1993). Conceptually, a plural reflexive might appear similar to reciprocal constructions,
but the meaning here is self directed, not one of exchange or sharing. As
with reciprocal constructions in Momu, there are both lexical and clausal
reflexives. However, in contrast to reciprocal forms, reflexive forms are built
only around (diﬀerent) pronominal marking.
10.2.3.1Reflexive clausesReflexives involve a comitative pronoun (§4.1.1) as the object of a transitive
verb, or the subject of an intransitive verb. This is a necessary but not
suﬃcient condition for a reflexive. That is, comitative pronouns are otherwise
found both in object positions, or as intransitive subjects in constructions
that are not reflexive.
(10.30) gives examples of reflexives combining with transitive verbs. In
elicitation, oblique marking was used on the comitative pronoun, (a). But
in just about all examples in the section, the oblique marker is elided as the
referent is topically active. As the primary coding site of reflexive action,
the comitative pronoun cannot be elided and the example remains a reflexive
construction. The subject can also be expressed as a regular pronoun (a), but
is often elided. So called emphatic-reciprocal pronominal forms (§4.1.4) can
be used in the subject position ((b) and (c)), mostly as markers of surprise.

state verbs like oemnitai ‘be(come) ruined’ (10.31a), or yefketa ‘be(come)
obstinate’, without a comitative pronoun (e.g., te oimnita ‘I am ruined’)
there is no indication of the instigator of the ruining. The choice of comitative pronoun however, indicates that the agent of this change of state is
themselves. Thus agent and patient collapse and these can be considered
reflexive.

to examples above. In (b) it is clearer, the utterance is self-directed, but the
intransitive verb is used for such cases, instead of the transitive verb.

10.2.3.2Lexical reflexivesI am aware of just two verbs that are lexical reflexives (or body action middles
(Kemmer, 1993)). These are the grooming verbs ofta ‘decorate (self), and
fwas ‘bathe (self).’ For these verbs a comitative pronoun is unnecessary. For
ofta an alternation in verb-forming suﬃxes is used to create a non-reflexive
form ofyer ‘decorate someone.’ For fwas there is a completely diﬀerent lexical
form (or rather pair of forms) absi/nebsi ‘wash one/many.’

10.2.3.3ma-childbirthThe role of body parts in self-directed activitiesBody or person parts in Momu serve as a proxy for the self and self-directed
or -inflicted behaviours. This avoids coding reflexives because the agent or
experiencer and patient are not coreferential. In Momu a body part can fill
either the agent or experiencer role in a pseudo-reflexive. Such constructions
appear to be more common when the outcome is perceived as negative for
346the referent, but this is not the only situation where it is used. The posture
or position of body parts is also a common proxy for the outward expression
of emotion (§13.2.1.2).
In cases where an action performed produces an outcome where the nonintended patient was the self, an alternate coding strategy exists in the form
of a body part or similar filling an argument role in the clause.
In (10.34a) the speaker describes someone cutting themselves. Instead of
using a reflexive construction, the knife becomes the agent-subject, and the

Many types of psychological expressions use bufo ‘thought’ as either the subject or object. The self-directed component in such expressions is eﬀectively
captured in thoughts being something done to the self and or arising in the
self. In the excerpt in (10.35), the speaker is describing the process of building a garden plot. Certain aspects of the process are described as (10.35a)
realisations or (b) remembering. These have a self-directed component in
their meanings. (10.35c) is provided for context only.

topological-relations10.3Speech act typesThis section considers clauses not as propositions, but as acts for communicating in a social world (König and Siemund, 2007). That is, sentences can
be used to achieve assertions of, or requests for information. They can be
used for concessions or commands. In Momu these are mostly marked by a
348small set of single-vowel, clause-final enclitics. Across speech act types some
forms are identical. In these cases accompanying intonation, and sometimes
sentence internal structure diﬀerentiate them.","[367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377]"
"354It is reasonably common for the speaker to question the reference of a
participant in the middle of a declarative sentence. Both forms of polar interrogative are used parenthetically in Momu. In this use, a regular declarative
clause is interrupted by a questioning of the identity of a given reference.
The queried quantity is marked either with the polar interrogative =fa or
a combination of the restrictive =s and disjunctive o. These are delivered,
often without pause or change in regular declarative intonation. As such,
the explicit marking of elements makes it clear that the overall statement is
asserted, but specific sub-elements are still in question.21

In Kwomtari the form used for polar questions can appear finally or in second
position (Honsberger et al., 2008, p168). This appears to be a diﬀerent us
however to that given here for Momu, but similar to the way in which the
restrictive is used for subjunctive-like clauses. The Kwomtari form pe as
given is used for polar questions, hortatives, and more generally epistemic
modality.
21I have tried to represent this mixed sentence type in translation by placing a parenthesised question mark after the questionable element. Alternatively, a fully expanded
translation for (10.49a) might be “This one—is it this?—came.” This doesn’t represent
the degree of integration into the main clause, however.","[382, 383]"

The disjunctive coordinator can be used with full clauses as well. The distribution of the coordinator is as varied for this kind of conjunction as it is
for nominals. (14.53) gives some basic examples of clausal disjunction, with
all three variants of disjunctive coordinator use.

rather interpreted from the lack of cohesion of the events in the coordinated
clauses.
In (14.54), the adversative reading is clear from the semantic incompatibility of the coordinated clauses. In (a), the desires are conflicting and in
(b) one cannot be ruined by someone else, and ruin oneself. More or less
common to all is that the subjects contrast between coordinated clauses.

marking across clauses can signal particular adversative meanings. The adverb fesis ‘again’ signals a concessive meaning in (14.55a). In (b), the second
clause specifically indicates negative reciprocation, in contrast to the first
clause. This is one use of the adverb akfu ‘reciprocally’ (§10.2.2.3). In
(c), an inceptive-marked clause (§12.1.2.4) frequently sets up an adversative
reading when the following clause is in some way incompatible.22 Use of
the adverb yesy ‘just’ in the second clause in such adversatives leads to a
substitutive (in the sense used by Thompson, Longacre and Hwang (2007,
pp263–264) for adverbial clauses).

"Abstract
This thesis is a description of the grammar of Eastern Momu, a language
spoken in Papua New Guinea in the north-western province of Sandaun.
This is a region with a fair amount of diversity, with several isolates or small
language families, and few detailed descriptions. Momu, or Fas as it is more
commonly known in the literature, together with the virtually undocumented
Baibai language, forms one of these small language families.
The thesis is structured such that after a general introduction to the
people, language, and region, I give chapters covering: phonology, phonotactics and morphophonemics (Ch. 2), word classes (Ch. 3), nominals (Ch.
4), noun phrases (Ch. 5), verbs (Ch. 6), aspect (ch. 7), grammatical relations (Ch. 8), adverbs (Ch. 9), clauses (Ch. 10), non-verbal predicates
(Ch. 11), modality and negation (Ch. 12), serial verb constructions (Ch.
13), compounds and coordination (Ch. 14), subordination (Ch. 15) and
complementation (Ch. 16).
At first glance, Momu has a relatively uncomplicated five vowel phonology, or ten vowels if one includes length. Glides hold a special position
within the phonology, phonotactics and morphophonology, as I have analysed it. Glides interact heavily with adjacent segments including metathesis
with adjacent consonants in a predictable fashion. Additional phonetic long
high vowels arise from some glide-vowel combinations. Amongst the consonants, there is a bilabial trill. This is an areal feature that is rare amongst
the world’s languages.
A marked feature of the verbal system, but also areally, is a relatively high
count of verbs coding verbal number. Verbal number in Momu is conservatively estimated to occupy 30% of the verbal lexicon, placing it at the upper
end of the typological space. The theme of verbal number runs throughout
the thesis as its relatively high frequency makes for contrastive behaviour incertain domains.
Momu has some classically ""Papuan"" features such as serial verb constructions and verb-final ordering (albeit not strictly so). This thesis aims
to position Momu within the growing body of work describing the incredible
features, number and variety of languages of Papua New Guinea, but also to
focus on a region within Papua New Guinea with perhaps a higher degree of
diversity and lower total count of documentation overall.","[7, 8, 9, 10]"
"11.2.1Equation and proper inclusionBoth equation and proper inclusion are expressed by the juxtaposition of
two noun phrases. Equation is where both NPs refer to the same entity
while proper inclusion (or what Dryer (2007a) refers to as “true nominal
predicates”) is where the reference of one can be thought of as being a member
of the set expressed by the other (Payne, 1997, p114).5 In English the two
5
Stassen (1997) refers to equational construction types as “identificational”. In doing
so, he points out that assigning notions of argument and predicate to this sentence type is
problematic. Grouping equation and proper inclusion together here is a decision based on
equivalence of basic form. I recognise, however, that there are good grounds to treat them
separately. A structural point of diﬀerence that is noted in this section is that juxtaposed
elements in an identificational or equational construction in Momu can commute without
altering the overall meaning, while the juxtaposed NPs expressing proper inclusion cannot.",[392]
"11.12.2Stance markingA construction type similar to the modal negative onfa (which takes a single,
oblique-marked complement) is available in the form of the stance predicate
wu (§16.1.2). The stance predicate is a grammaticalised form of the existential verb which is uninflectable for subject. Unlike onfa, it takes a small set
of modal and aspectual inflections (the full range is not clear at this stage)
which include:
• the volitional future wumu ‘it will be the case that...’
• the irrealis imperfective wuta ‘it might be that...’
• the perfective wu ‘it was the case that...’
By merit of carrying these aspectual and modal values, when a non-verbal
predicate is a complement to this form, these modal and aspectual values
are able to be specified for the non-verbal predicate:

2010.8215.7Absolutive clausesThe term “absolutive clause” comes from Thompson, Longacre and Hwang
(2007) and refers to a subordinate clause lacking an overt marker of the relationship between it and the main clause. In Momu, this is the subordinating
use of a deverbal clause, with none of the marking otherwise described in
this section. The adverbial role of such a clause is determined from context, in much the same fashion as otherwise unmarked clausal coordination
(§14.2.1.3).
A thorough analysis of the (quite broad) range of possibilities within this
type is beyond the scope of the present work.14 Instead, I present a sample of
the kinds of meanings expressed via absolutive clauses. Interpreted functions
are given in the translation in parentheses. In the majority of cases, the
interpretation is of consequences.

14Briefly, an avenue of future exploration would be the insubordinative uses of deverbal
clauses (Heine, Kaltenböck and Kuteva, 2016). While I am aware of such uses in Momu,
they were rare enough that more data gathering would be necessary to give a proper
explication.","[543, 544]"

‘M: (That) might be his food.’ (epistemic assertion)
(12.29d) is an identificational clause (§11.2.1) with a topically elided subject
(the referent having been clearly established at this point). Identificational
clauses lack aspectual or modal distinctions, but embedded within the complement to the irrealis progressive form of the stance predicate it can be understood to be a currently held state of aﬀairs which the speaker considers
likely to continue to hold. In making the utterance in this form, Monica
establishes her subjective opinion in this turn of the discourse. This triggers
a progression in the dialogue: they move on to a new topic immediately.14
The stance predicate takes a limited range of aspectual and modal inflection. The meaning expressed by the stance predicate can be roughly
paraphrased as “(it is / was / might be) the case that ...”, which correspond
to forms of the predicate marked irrealis progressive (wuta), perfective (wu)
and volitional future (wumu) respectively.
The predicate is fixed upon the third person singular subject form. The
complement to the stance predicate is marked with the oblique case. The
complement itself may be perfective (§7.2), volitional future (§12.1.1.1) or
take realis progressive (§7.4.2), if verbal. The complement can also contain a
non-verbal predicate (§11) as in the example above, which expresses universal
14The stance predicate does not signal the end of a topic. There are many more factors
at play here, but I do not discuss them further as this section is mainly about the epistemic
value of the stance predicate.","[431, 432]"
"9.5.1nu “just/already”The adverb nu ‘just/already’ indicates that the event is proximal to the reference time. By proximal I mean that the event has some sense of immediacy
with respect to the reference time. Baron (1984), following Li, Thompson
and Thompson (1982) referred to the particle as marking currently relevant
state of aﬀairs (CRS). Li, Thompson and Thompson used the term to refer
311to the perfect marker le in Mandarin Chinese. As described, it is a good
fit for the behaviour of nu in Momu when the overall viewpoint is perfective. In the typologically sensitive treatment of tense, aspect and modality
by Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca (1994), the present distinction might be referred to as “immediate”, however, treatment of the immediate in that work
is in combination with anterior or future tense. There is no consideration of
an “immediate” aspect independent of tense. A similar use of “immediate”
is found in Bininj Gun-Wok (Evans, 2003, pp524–525), where a prefix hexpresses “immediacy of the predicate or its simultaneity with the deictic
centre” and also “in presentatives to give vividness”.
Nu can occur with either perfective or imperfective clauses, but more
commonly with perfective clauses to express the past perfect. Nu can occur
with volitional future marking, and also with the epistemic future, although
textual occurrences are rare. Possible co-occurrence with the rarer modal
markers has not been confirmed.
By way of demonstrating the various combinations, (9.10) below includes
separate clauses taken (in order) from various points in an explanatory text.
Here, Kaspar narrates as he demonstrates lighting a fire using friction created by pulling a vine against a split branch pinned under his foot. In
the introduction, he explains that his ancestors did not have matches, (e.g.,
(a)). These simple facts are all expressed without nu, as predicted by Li,
Thompson and Thompson (1982).
Only when he starts to demonstrate does he start to use nu. Just before,
or as he begins, he utters (b), combining nu with a volitional-future-marked
verb. He is signalling that the action is imminent. He then alternates
between perfective utterances like (c) where he narrates actions just performed (and highly relevant to the demonstration) and those like (b) where
he flags a progression in the narrative. He also uses the realis progressive
in (d) at critical points where something of interest is happening and again
reverts to the perfective in (e) as the demonstration wraps up.

At all times in the above example, the currently relevant state is relative to
the default reference time, which is the time of utterance.
The reference time need not be the time of utterance. In texts or discourse centred around past or future events nu signals relative proximity or
relevance to those events. However, the reference time can even be abstract.
For instance, in the elicitation data below, I am probing imperfective forms
involving -ta ‘stvzr’ (§7.5.3). The context is describing unwitnessed pigs
that may have eaten through a garden plot. We begin with hypothetical
occurrences and end at habitual behaviours. Habitual behaviours abstract
time across several points which may span past and/or future occurrences.
In the right context, nu can apply to habitual actions as well.
In (a) the irrealis progressive indicates possible behaviour that might
be in play at the time of utterance. This is similar to the realis progressive in (9.10d), except that in the example the event is definitely occurring.
In (9.11b) we shift to the possibility that it had been happening last night.
In both cases, these combine with nu to express the immediacy of the events
(i.e., everyone wants to avoid his or her food crops being eaten). In (c) we
shift to describing the habitual behaviour of pigs. As a simple statement of
fact, nu does not occur with the habitual in (c), but when the relevant time
for the habitual is the present, then nu is used to signal this in (d).

Otherwise, nu is not likely to occur in clauses describing habitual actions.
In the example above, it is relative to what has occurred before that we are
able to set up the use of nu with a habitual form.
Nu can also combine with the inceptive =meni (§12.1.2.4).

and/or that it harmonises with the following vowel. For instance, (d) above
may be rendered as ni=kisyitasa. But nu can also occur alone as a lexical
item. It is a valid response to a request where the respondent indicates that
they have already performed the action (and that they have just done it).

after (and together with) several related adverbial clause types such as the
completive -sen (§15.4) in the above example, or restrictive clauses (§15.6),
or simply coordinated perfective clauses, as well as with the fixed phrase eru
ere ‘and so (lit. ‘that’ + ‘like that’)’, which all function similarly to progress

an action. The construction implies that the action failed, but subsequent
clauses need not aﬃrm this.
As a construction, the final verb cannot be inflected for modal categories
(except the modal predicate =meni ‘inceptive’, §12.1.2.4). Nor can the clause
combine with the modal adverb nu ‘just/already’ (to express the perfect).
The final verb must be unmarked for modal categories or the imperfective.

‘I went, and tried to see.’2008.9These are past oriented attempts. Future oriented attempts can be expressed
by the volitional future (§12.1.1.1).
The form (fe)sim may be related to the other adverbs fesib ‘completely’
(§9.5.5) and fesis ‘again’ (§9.5.6). The final segment in these three forms
corresponds neatly to the three markers =m (oblique), =s (restrictive) and
=b (comitative), all of which are often (apparently) fused into adverbial
forms.59.6.3biom ‘inability’Biom ‘inability’ is a modal adverb used to express inability to perform an
action. The verb must be volitional-future-marked. Most commonly this
adverb modifies a volitional-future-marked verb in the interrogative mood.

it occurs in an absolutive adverbial clause. In (b) a volitional-future-marked
complement to the modal negative predicate usually expresses inability, but
biom can also be added.6

5An alternative etymology for (fe)sim may be that the initial syllable, often dropped,
may be the intensifier fe=. In which case the form sim may be related to sisy ‘also,’ which
is also often shortened to just si.
