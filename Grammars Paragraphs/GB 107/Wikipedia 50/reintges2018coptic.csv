Coptic has an extensive set of negative0 assertive-promissivedevicesOD inference through reasoninginformation, but rather to express denial and contradiction of a previousstatement, rejecting its content either entirely or partially and convey this
evaluation to the addressee. A negated clause is obtained by modifying anconjugation patterns, which are formed with such diverse morphologicalas negative affixes and adverbs,auxiliary verbs, as well asspecialised negative tense-aspect markers.
An overview of the negative verbal system is presented in section 9.1.
The addition of a negative marker to the verb may make the entire clause
negative, but it is also possible to use the same negation pattern to
explicitly negate a single clausal constituent, leaving the rest of the clause
outside of the scope of negation. Section 9.2 settles some general issues
concerning the operation of negative scope, i.e. the different meanings
associated with negative sentences. Section 9.3 deals with the double
negation N ... an, in which negative polarity corresponds to two distinct
markers, viz. the negative prefix n- and the clause-internal negationadverb an ‘not’. Section 9.4 deals with negative tenses, where negativepolarity’ and a particu ar temporal, aspectual, or modal category are
expressed by a single, indivisible morph. Another topic of this section
concerns negative conjugations formed with the auxiliary verb 1 ‘to do
not’.","[232, 233, 234]"

In this example, the negative is locat
ed
within the clause functioning as
the complement to the matrix verb
‘to believe’. It is generally the case
that a negative in one clause
have scope over another clause that
it is coordinated with, e.g.

9.2.2 Wide scope

deny that some condition or state holds true without specifying the
grounds, e.g. NNECNHY Pp xpla an ‘the brothers (Ne-cNHy) do not (aN)

with word
order. Coptic Egyptian may be described as a discourse-configur

a de arture
from the canonical subject-verb-object (S-V-O) ordering.

l relative

e clauses

constituent is equated with a relative clause.
;
7 ae’ concluding chapter of this grammar (UNIT 12) is
concerned with
nite anc non-finite subordinate clauses, which function as
dependent
constituents within some larger construction. A major
division of
subordinate clauses concerns the opposition between argum
ent clauses
that belong to the core of the matrix verb phrase, and
adjunct clauses
that belong to its periphery. Of particular relevance are
topics like
:
’ clausal coherence and switch reference (i.e.
the contrast between same: Subject and different-subject clauses), sequences of tenses,
and indirect
speech-acts (reported speech, indirect questions and comma
nds)
“Sounds and spellingcaneNn,‘This Unit addresses two interrelated topics: one concerns the CoptoGreek alphabet, i.e. the notation system in which Coptic texts have
‘been codified, and the other concems its sound system, or phonology.
‘Section 1.1 discusses the main aspects of Coptic orthography, while
‘section 1.2 presents several types of evidence for the pronunciation of a
4particular letter or gtapheme. There is not always a one-to-one
correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, since some
‘phonemes may be expressed by more than one grapheme and, vice
‘versa, some graphemes may have more than one phonological
‘interpretation, Section 1.3 is about suprasegmental phonology, i.e. the
‘phonological structure beyond the individual sounds or phonemes, with
particular attention for vowel length, syllable structure, and stress
-|placement.
. Section 1.4 addresses the question of language contact and linguistic
borrowing. The Coptic word stock has a considerable Greek
{jcomponent. The transfer of Greek lexical material was not confined to
{content words, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, but also mvolved a
‘tconsiderable amount of function words, such as sentence conjunctions,discourse markers, mannerand time adverbials,and evensomeprepositions. The variant spelling of Copto-Greek loan words not only
reflects ongoing sound changes in the source language Koine Greek,
but also the absence of certain phonological oppositions in the
borrowing language Coptic Egyptian.","[17, 18]"

"PLURALmy children|ThisTheseSING. FEMmy wife_TABLE 5.2 Tripartite nominal sentencesBi- and tripartite nominal sentences differ from one another in the
number of sentence constituents defining each pattern, which reflects
different types of agreement marking. In bipartite nominal sentences,The obligatory third Person pronouns of
tripartite nominal sentences
are not associated with anaphoric reference
(i.e. they are not linked to a
preceding noun phrase), but rather funct
ion as purely morphological
markers that indicate the syntactic relation
between the subject and the
nominal predicate. In this grammar, the term
agreement clitic will
be'used to describe the structural role of the
non-anaphoric pronoun in
this nominal sentence pattern. The reaso
n why Coptic uses a
desemanticized pronoun as an agreement-ma
rking device is to prevent
potential structural ambiguity between
a phrasal and a sentential
interpretation of a sequence of two noun
phrases. By separating the
subject from the nominal Predicate, the inte
rvening singular masculine
Pronoun re distinguishes the sentential
structure from its phrasal
counterpart.
5.2.11 Main differences between agreemen
t clitics and copular verbs
Most Coptic grammars use the term “deic
tic copula”. to indicate the
syntactic function of the non-anaphoric
third person pronouns of
tripartite nominal sentences. The added
pronoun has actually very little
in common with copular verbs, Copt
ic has two equivalents to the
English copular verb be, oyn’ ‘(there)
is’ and un ‘(there) is not’,
Which are appear clause-initially in exist
ential sentences, e.g. oyn
“pane mriema ‘is (oyn) someone (pwri
e) here (t-mei-na)?’ (AP,
‘Chaine no. 261, 80:5), mm Aaay “(there)
is 70 (tin) one (Aaay)’ (V.
Pach. 1:7). The verbal copulas oyn and
mn differ from the agreement
nal sentences in the following respect:or non-existence of some discourse entity. This
ontrasts with the agreement-marking clitic of tripartite nominal
sentences, which has no such predicate role and can therefore not
be construed as part of the sentence predicate.
°,The agreement clitic has no negative counterpart comparable to the
negative copular verb mn, To assign a negative value to the nominal
predicate, the negative adverb an ‘not’ has to be inserted into thestructure, ¢.g. NTOK AN Tie Tppo ‘you (NToR) (are) not (aN) the
king (m1-ppo)’ (Ac. A&P 202:108).eal°While the verbal copula must be construed with an indefinite
subject, the subject of tripartite nominal sentences must be a
definite. Thus, compare: MN NoyTe NCA neX€ ic MNoyTEe
miizgarioc ama muna ‘(there) is no (uN) God (NoyTe) besides
(Nca) Jesus Christ (e-X€ i€), the God (m-NoyTe) of the holy
(t-n-garioc) Apa Mena’ (Mena, Mir. 34a:18-21) vs. oya ne
NNOYTE NAMA NTeremu mexc ic ‘unique (oya) (is) the God
(m-Noyte) of Apa (N-ara) Ptolemy, Jesus Christ (me-Xc)’ (KMHL
I 36:27-37:1).","[100, 101]"
"A&P9.4.6 The negative auxiliary ™
Coptic has yet another group. of negative conjugation patterns
that are
formed with the negative auxiliary tm ‘to do not’. The auxiliary
1M is
‘semantically more restricted than other types of negation, since it can
only
take narrow scope over the main verb and its complements, e.g.
axxaa xe
AGYTAN NNEQBAA ETMGWHT Epod emp ‘but (arava) because
(xe)
he closed (aq-qTan) his eyes (N-NEq-BAd) Hot fo see (€-TH-6wyT)

(t-2koe!T)

The predicate negation properties of +m are particularly

nal elementsthat
perform some of the most fundamental
functions of language: deixis
(locating entities), interrogation (asking questi
ons), and quantification(counting things). As a technical term of grammar,
deixis means ‘pointing
by language’. The label “demonstratives” is used
as a cover term for
grammatical items like this and that, which
accomplish this task of
pointing. Apart from this localising function, demon

Questions are pragmatically marked speech-acts,
which signal a request
for information on the part of the speaker about something
he believes that
the addressee knows. The missing piece of infor
mationis indicated by
question words like who or what. Coptic has
a fairly extensive class of
such question words, which will be discussed
in section 4.2, Another topic
of this section concerns dedicated interrogativ
