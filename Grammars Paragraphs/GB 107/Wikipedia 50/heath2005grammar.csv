waeld has various senses: a) 'without ...' (followed by NP); b) 'even ...'
(followed by NP) or 'even if ...' (followed by clause), c) '..., nor...' in parallel
negations; d) '(not) anything' (emphatic negative polarity item). The particle
represents the confluence of various Arabic forms, in some cases perhaps via
Songhay or other African languages. An example in the sense (b) 'even',
where it is dialectally interchangeable with kud, is (696).

The phrase-final particle r a s 'only' is extremely common.","[635, 636]"
"The perfective negative corresponds to both simple perfective (PerfP) and
resultative (Resit). This makes sense, since a past negative statement denies
that an event took place over a generous time span, making aspectual
distinctions less useful than in the positive. As a result, (638.a) negates both
PerfP assasn-aer Ί knew, found out' and the more common Resit assan-aer Ί
know' (stative).
The normal imperfective negative construction consists of waer and a
special LoImpfN stem (a negative variant of LoImpfP). The LoImpfN blocks
the ablaut accent χ and the first-syllable full-V feature χ that appear in the
LoImpfP, while allowing final-syllable χ and all consonantal adjustments
found in the LoImpfP (prefix -t-, gemination). The LoImpfN also has strict
«Η» melody, while the LoImpfP has «Η» or «L» melody depending on verb
class (§7.2.5.1).
To negate an imperfective, we get waer plus a special LoImpfN stem that
is related to, but distinct from, the LoImpfP. For the future negative see §9.1.4
below. The negative imperative (=prohibitive) includes waer but the stemchoice is somewhat complex; see §7.2.4.4.

For special forms like wasdden used in biclausal negatives ('it is not the

Forms used as negative polarity items (like 'anything' in 'not ...
anything') include ordinary generic nouns like ae-wadam 'person', haeraet
'thing', and e-daegg 'place', but also the specialized and somewhat emphatic
polarity form waeld 'nothing' (nonhuman). Its extension waela ""iy-aen 'not
(even) one, none at all' can be added to any NP. For abstractions and other
mass nouns, waeld andasrr-asn 'not (even) a little' can be used. The form
waeld, in other contexts, has a range of uses from emphatic 'even' to
disjunctive 'or'. A more general '(not) at all' polarity item is the interjectionlike element faeww! (640.f)·

"7.2 Stem categories

(307)Basic Verb Stems
a.perfective system
Perfective Positive (PerfP)
Resultative (Resit)
Perfective Negative (PerfN)b.long imperfective system
Long Imperfective Positive (LoImpfP)
Long Imperfective Negative (LoImpfN)

c.short imperfective system
Short Imperfective (Shlmpf)
Imperative (Imprt)
Hortative (Hort)The three ""systems"" are based on morphology, not (just) on meaning.
The Imprt has special 2Sg, 2MaPl, and 2FePl forms. All other stems are
inflectable in the sense that they can take the full set of pronominal subject
prefixes and suffixes. A minor exception is that special perfectives of many
adjectival verbs can take subject suffixes but not prefixes.
In French-language scholarship, the Resit is often referred to as ""l'intensif
de raccompli."" Likewise, the LoImpfP is referred to as ""l'intensif de
l'inaccompli."" The two ""intensives"" have some ablaut features in common,
namely χ-pcl (accent) and χ-pcl (V-lengthening).
I use ""long imperfective"" to designate a set of stems characterized by
ablaut formatives including at least one consonantal increment (prefixation of
-t- or internal gemination). The short imperfectives and the perfectives lack
these consonantal increments; they are distinguished from each other by stem
vocalism, except that adjectival verbs often have an irregular perfective stem.
The basic grammatical difference between the Shlmpf and the LoImpfP is that
the Shlmpf functions as a dependent form, either preceded by a Future particle
or occurring in add-on clauses following an independent clause. The English
present tense of stative verbs ('they know', 'it is green') usually translates into
Tamashek as Resit (rather than LoImpfP). The LoImpfP is therefore typically
used for habitual aspect, and for ongoing activities (e.g. progressives).
Inflectable verb stems take default accents, with three exceptions. First,
an ablaut accent formative occurs in the Resit (but not other perfective) and
LoImpfP (but not other long imperfective) stems (§7.2.2.2, §7.2.5.1). Second,
unaugmented V-final verb forms combine with V-initial suffixes to produce
words with surface penultimate accent, suggesting both the stem-final V and
the suffix-initial V are counted for purposes of Default Accentuation (though
they are later contracted into a single surface V); see §3.3.1.2 and §7.3.1.3-4.
This is compatible with Default Accentuation, but the latter must apply at a
pre-surface level. Third, these unaugmented V-final verbs undergo Stem-Final
i/A-Deletion (29) (§3.1.2.4) in the short imperfectives, and for a subset of
these verbs (specifically, the light stems, e.g. -vCCi>), the resulting stem-final
CC cluster is resyllabified (Final-CC Schwa-Insertion (44), §3.2.4); in the T-ka
dialect this resyllabification entails a shift of accent to the inserted schwa (i.e.
onto the stem-final syllable); see §3.3.1.2, §7.3.1.3. With these exceptions,
inflected verb stems (and inflected forms) are transcribed below with default
accent (""v""). If an unaccented inflected verb has fewer than three syllables, a
phrasal accent will appear on any preceding particles within the accentual
phrase. Thusl-bsa 'he vomited', negative war i-bsa 'he did not vomit' with
phrasal accent on the Neg particle.","[318, 319]"
"9.5 External negation and negative copular clauses
In addition to the normal clause-intemal negation, expressed with waer as a
preverbal particle (§9.6.2), there is an external negative element (arguably
segmentable) with the dialectal variants indicated in (633).

taken as Neg waer plus 3MaPl PerfN je-n (A-grm variant -ge-n), hence 'they

ending. In any event, the dialectally predominant form waedden, and its variant
waedder, are not cleanly segmentable in this way, since there is no suitable
verb stem -vdi>. A similar variation in ending is seen in sasdder 'not yet',
variant saedden (§11.3.5). However, saedden is a rare variant limited to certain
eastern dialects, while waedden and its variants are widespread.",[604]
"It is not possible to add a second verb under the scope of a Negative
particle in the first clause. In such contexts, the second verb has its own
Negative particle (830.a). This is true even in (830.b) where the second verb is
in PerfN form, i.e. is indexed as negated. However, if the second clause is
positive and already effectively subordinated to a preceding clause, so that the
two form a single proposition, it may remain attached without change when the
first clause is negated; in (830.c), the final LoImpfP clause is a kind of serial
adjunct to the 'go to' clause and is therefore included in the scope of the higher
negation.

"Negative particleverbablaut changec.definite demonstrative
definite demonstrativeverb
participleablaut change
ablaut changeIn (8.a), a morphophonological rule Prefix Reduction (e.g. -a- reduced to
-as-, or -i- reduced to -a-) applies to nouns in combinations with specific
preceding forms. Of special interest is the fact that reduction applies to the122 Overviewverb-subject sequence, but not to a verb-object sequence. For more on the
role this plays in ""case marking,"" see §2.3, below.
For verbs, the only true local dependency is that of an inflected verb on a
preceding Negative (8.b). This applies in all combinations where no elements
(other than floating clitics) intervene between the two, hence to perfective,
(long) imperfective, and imperative (i.e. prohibitive) stems. Basically the
modification converting Y to Y' adds phonetic content (where it is not
vacuous) in the perfective, reduces phonetic content (erasing a V-length ablaut
formative χ-pcl and an accent ablaut formative χ-pcl) in the imperfective and
prohibitive, and modifies the stem vocalism in all of these stems.
The cases in (8.c) are limited to definite relative clauses, which begin
with a definite demonstrative (in apposition to the head NP, which if overtly
expressed is external to the clause). The modification in ablaut form of the
verb involves erasure of a V-length ablaut formative (χ-pcl), and (with
specific exceptions) a shift in the location of the ablaut accent formative (in
one combination, this formative is entirely erased). The formulation of the
relevant rules requires an extraordinary interpenetration of ""syntax"" and
""phonology,"" and constitutes an important empirical argument against highly
modularized theories of grammar.
It is possible to combine two [X Y'...] configurations, as in the
combination [Negative verb noun(subject) ...]. In this combination, the
relevant pairs involving local dependencies are [Negative verb] and [verb
noun(subject)]. As a result, internal bracketing as in [Negative [verb
noun(subject)] ...] or [[Negative verb] noun(subject) ...] is counterproductive
(any such bracketing would appear to separate two forms that enter into a local
dependency). The only points that matter are adjacency (disregarding clitics)
and the grammatical relationship (e.g. Negative + verb, or verb +
noun(subject).

Short ImperfectiveThe cases in (9) involve either a Future particle or a particular type of
complementizer, plus an inflected ""Short Imperfective"" form. The latter cannot
be used clause-initially with its usual subject pronominal inflections. However,
the short imperfective is related to the positive imperative (which has no
morphological connection to the prohibitive). The positive imperative is
clause-initial (hence is preceded by no ""X"" element), and it lacks the usual
subject pronominals.","[30, 31]"
"2.5 Verbs
Tamashek verbs have a number of stems distinguished by ablaut. The basic set
of inflectable stems, organized into three subsystems on morphological
grounds, is given in (12).
(12)Verb Stems
a. perfective subsystem
PerfP [perfective positive]
PerfN [perfective negative] (after Neg w£er)
Resit [resultative] (positive only)
b. short imperfective subsystem
Shlmpf [short imperfective] (after Fut ad or complementizer)
Imprt [imperative] (in positive only)162 Overview
c. long imperfective subsystem
LoImpfP [long imperfective positive]
LoImpfN [long imperfective negative] (after Neg waer)
Prohib [prohibitive] (after Neg waer)For example, 'get' has PerfP -sjraew-, Shlmpf -sjrew-, and LoImpfP
-jamew-. The perfective and short imperfective subsystems generally differ
only in vocalism, while the long imperfective subsystem is characterized by
consonantal (as well as vocalic) ablaut features.
Some of these stems can occur clause-initially, but others (PerfN, Shlmpf,
LoImpfN, Prohib) occur only after a preverbal particle (for the Shlmpf the
relevant particle need not be adjacent). The specifically negative stems occur
after Negative preverb waer. The Shlmpf stem is used after Future ad and in
some other dependent positions.
The Resit is very common, and in many cases can be translated as a
present-tense stative verb in English ('know', 'be sitting'). The LoImpfP
denotes recurring or habitual events, as well as progressives ('be dancing').
For morphological purposes, it is necessary to distinguish numerous verb
classes, based on their basic stem shape, e.g. -vPQvC- or -CuCCu- (+ -t). See
§2.11, below, for the notation. Two important factors in verbal morphology are
the heaviness of the stem (light, middleweight, or superheavy, the latter two
subsumed under ""heavy""); the presence of any full V ' s initially, medially, or
finally; and (for V-final) stems whether the verb takes Augment -t.
Participles, which agree in number and gender (but not person), are used
in subject relatives. They can be formed from those non-imperative verb stems
that occur clause-initially (PerfP, Resit, LoImpfP). In combinations involving a
preverbal particle, the Participial affix can be added to the particle, the details
depending on dialect. Modifying adjectives are a special case of intransitive
participle.
Essentially all verbs have a Verbal Noun (VblN) formed by ablaut. A
large number of verbs also have an Agentive. There are a number of less
productive nominalization patterns confined to a few verbs.
Valency-changing derivations include causative, mediopassive, passive,
and reciprocal. These categories are expressed by derivational prefixes with
some associated ablaut changes. Causative and passive are especially
productive, and layered derivations (e.g. passive of causative) are very
common. Each such derived verb has its own full set of stems of type (12), as
well as participles and a VblN.","[34, 35]"

undergoes Short-V Harmony to war when immediately followed by a high
vowel {u a i}. Both the PerfP and the Resit of positive sentences are negated
by a single form that is here labeled PerfN (Perfective Negative). For example,
both PerfP sssaen-aer Ί knew, found out', and the much more common Resit
sssdn-aev Ί know', are negated as war assen-aer Ί don't know' or Ί didn't
know'.
Curiously, the same combination of waer plus PerfN verb that is used to
negative the PerfP or Resit is also used as a prohibitive (i.e., negative
imperative) 'don't VERB!'. There is no audible difference, even at clause
level, between the prohibitive and perfective negative readings. However,
there is an alternative prohibitive construction consisting of waer plus the
Prohibitive] stem, which belongs to the long imperfective system. See
§7.2.5.3 for both types of prohibitive.
The PerfN is formed from the PerfP by adding a single ablaut formative
that is realized (if at all) as an e vowel. I label this e -pelf. This formative is
expressed audibly only in light stems ending in ...CaeC-, where it appears in
the second syllable. Otherwise the PerfN is homophonous to the PerfP. The
basic morphological data are given in (312).","[327, 328]"

"3.5.2.2Verbs after Negative particlesThe basic Negative preverb is waer, used in all MAN combinations (e.g.
perfective, imperfective, imperative). In all of the interactions described below,
the Neg preverb must be adjacent to the affected verb.
In the perfective, if the verb stem is bisyllabic and ends in ...aeC-, the ae is
converted to e. Bisyllabic V-final verbs, i.e. those of the shape -vC(C)i> or
-uC(C)i>, allow this vocalic substitution to apply in combinations where the
stem-final full V appears as se in combination with a subject suffix. The
modified stem with e is the PerfN (perfective negative) stem, and is part of the
""perfective system."" For other verbs, and for -vC(C)i> or -OC(C)D- verbs with
no subject suffix, the PerfN is indistinguishable from the PerfP (perfective
positive).
The modification in the PerfN is treated formally here as the effect of an
ablaut formative e - p c l f (§3.4.4, §7.2.2.3), where e targets the first
postconsonantal short V if this V is also stem-final in the sense indicated. Note
that this stem-modification is additive (i.e. it increases phonological
markedness) rather than reductive.
In the imperfective (indicative), the only stem that can directly follow the
Neg particle is the long imperfective. In comparison with the positive form
(LoImpfP), the negative counterpart (LoImpfN) is characterized by <H>
melody, and by the absence of the ablaut features that lengthen and accent the
first postconsonantal V in the LoImpfP, i.e. χ-pcl and χ-pcl. Since the
LoImpfP can have <L> or <H> melody depending on its syllabic shape, the
melodic difference between LoImpfP and LoImpfN is audible only for those
verbs whose LoImpfP has <L> melody. Example: 'destroy', with LoImpfP
-hdllaek- and LoImpfN -hsllak-. These two forms differ in having <L> versus
<H> melody, and in that -hallsek- has an accented full ά while -halbk- has no
full V and no marked accent. For more on long imperfectives see §7.2.5.
In the imperative, there are two options for negation. One is to use the
same PerfN form described above, so 'don't-Sg eat!' is identical to 'you-Sg
didn't eat'. The other is to use a stem of the long imperfective family, with the
same vocalic melody as the LoImpfP, but without the formatives χ-pcl and
χ-pcl. I refer to this stem as the Prohibitive]. Thus 'don't-Sg destroy!' can be1523 Phonologyexpressed as either wser t-ahlek (with PerfN stem, note the e) or as wasr
haellaek (with the Prohib). For more on these negative imperatives see §7.2.5.3.
The data are summarized in (129).
(129)Effect of Negative Particle on Verb Form
In the sequence [Neg VERB ...], the verb is adjusted as follows:
a. perfective: replace χ by e if the as is first postconsonantal V and is
in the stem-final syllable (e -pelf)
b. long imperfective (indicative): superimpose <H> melody, erase
χ-pcl and χ-pcl
c. long imperfective (imperative): erase χ-pcl and χ-pclThe omission of χ-pcl and χ-pcl features in (129.b-c) is vaguely similar
to the shortening of full V's in Prefix Reduction for nouns (§3.5.1, above).
However, the resemblance is weak. Prefix Reduction has no effect on lexical
accentuation, while (129.b-c) include erasure of a marked accent. Whereas
Prefix Reduction changes PI prefix i- to V and has no effect on the noun stem
proper, verbs after Neg do not reduce 3MaSg subject prefix i- but do undergo
vocalic reductions after the stem's first C position. The other changes in verbs,
namely replacement of ae by e (129.a) and the superimposition of <H> melody
in (129.b), are idiosyncratic. It is clear that no general principle accounts for
the details of the phonological modifications of nouns in dependent state and
of post-negative verbs. Rather, the ablaut modifications are highly
morphologized.","[170, 171]"
"9.6.3Future (ad, ar, mar, mad, e)The Future particle has a form dd in clause-initial position. It is followed
(after any clitics that may be present) by a Shlmpf or (rarely) LoImpfP verb
stem. I was told by informants that there is a dialectal variant ar, but I cannot
identify the dialect(s) in question, and ad is usual in all the dialects I worked
on.
The d of ad is dropped before any clitic, as in αΑΚί i-wat 'he will hit me'
(lSgO clitic Ahi). Perhaps a trace of the *d lingers in the geminated tt of the
3MaSgO clitic Att (postvocalic allomorph), as in aAtt awat-aer Ί will hit
him', but the geminated tt is now part of the clitic and is also heard after
V-final verb stems (§10.3.1).
The alternation of ad and ά in the Future particle results in partial
convergence between this particle and the combination aAd consisting of a5909 Verb phrases and other predicationsminimal demonstrative ά and a following cliticized Comitative preposition d
(= ad). This a-\d functions as the normal jussive complementizer (§13.3). The
surface convergence of complementizer a - \ d with Fut d d is especially
thoroughgoing in that the -\d in a-\d is omitted if another clitic is present, as in
certain high-frequency adverbial clause types. Therefore both Fut ad and
complementizer a-\d appear as phonetic [ad] without a clitic and as phonetic
[a] before a clitic. Moreover, both occur clause-initially.
However, there is a syntactic distinction between Future ad and the
combination a-\d in the way they combine with negation. The combination
Neg + Fut is expressed as Neg wzer (or a reduced allomorph) plus a distinctive
non-clause-initial Future allomorph such as m a d or e replacing ad (§9.6.4,
below). By contrast, complementizer a-\d is followed by Neg waer. In
addition, Future ad can only be followed by a Shlmpf or (much less often)
LoImpfP stem, whereas complementizer a-\d can be followed by a fuller range
of stems (including perfectives).
In ordinary contexts, the verb stem used after Future ad is the Shlmpf, as
in (641.a). The LoImpfP is much less common, but can be used to specify an
extended time span (641.b).

hereWhen the Future particicle is noninitial in the clause, ad is replaced by
another form. The dialects split into two main groups (and one divergent
dialect) based on their noninitial Future particle.

The relevant contexts for the noninitial Future particles are: a) after
Negative waer (for special combinatory forms see §9.6.4, below), b) after the
head noun (or demonstrative) in a relative clause (participial or nonparticipial), and c) after Focus particle ά (§12.2).","[608, 609]"

than Berber term. It is the plural twairag of the Hassaniya noun ta:rg-i, which
denotes a (freeborn) Tuareg warrior. The Tuareg refer to their own language as
t-ae-ma:saeq-q (or variant, see below), a feminine noun based on a stem
-mdisaer- whose core sense is again 'Tuareg warrior'. The northern Berber
language name ""Tamazight"" is cognate.
Because Tuareg varieties are spoken by nomads and transhumants over a
vast area in southern Algeria, northern Mali, the north of the Republic of
Niger, and (more recently) in Burkina Faso, and because in a given local area
there are many tribal and caste divisions that have linguistic ramifications, it is
very difficult to decide whether we are dealing with a single ""Tuareg""
language (with many dialects), or two or more languages (each with some
internal dialectal variation).
One popular division of Tuareg is given in (3).

8.5.6.1Participles built on preverbal particles
Participles with Negative w&rSubject relatives with a negation are constructed by participializing (i.e. adding
Participial suffixes to) the Negative particle waer. The MaSg is -aen and the
FeSg is -aet as in simple verb participles, but the PI ending is now also -aen
(homophonous with the MaSg), as seen in (515). In K-f, the Participial suffixes
lose their short V, resulting in PI and MaSg n- and FeSg t-. In Im dialect, ngeneralizes from Masg and PI to FeSg, and is prosodically part of the
following verb.

K-f
ImThe inflected verb (PerfN, LoImpfN) itself follows the participialized
negative. In the MaSg and FeSg cases, the verb has the same form it would
have following waer in a non-participial clause. Therefore the MaSg begins in
i-, which is audible before a C or a verb beginning in underlying schwa (but is
zeroed, as usual, before ae or a full V). The FeSg begins in t-, which is audible
before any V, but is deleted before CV... However, the expected 3MaPl or
3FePl subject suffix is absent in this negative participial construction (cf.
3MaPl -aen and 3FePl -naet with ordinary inflected verbs).",[512]
"4227 Verbal morphologyFor T-ka and some other dialects, -νΐΐυ- is syntactically transitive, but the
""object"" is an invariant 3MaSg clitic (allomorphs -\e, -\t, etc.), and in some
combinations this clitic is optionally dropped. For these dialects, the clitic is
nonreferential. When the Negative preverbal particle is present, the clitic (as
usual) follows thie Negative particle. Examples showing the clitic are in (424).

men-MaPlAs (424.c) shows, the subject can be 1st or 2nd person, generally in the
sense 'be (here), be present'. Further examples are slle-q-\q Ί am here',
n-all-\e 'we are here', and t-alld-mAt 'you-MaPl are present'.
For the primary K-d, T-ka, and R informants, omission of the 3MaSgO
clitic occurred after 2FePl -maet and 3FePl -naet (in positive sentences), hence
t-alld-maet 'you-FePl are here' and alla-nast 'they-FePl exist, are here', instead
of #t-alla-ma£t-\t, etc. Contrast 3MaPl all0-n-\t in these dialects, with clearly
audible 3MaSgO clitic -\t. There is no phonological reason preventing the7.3 Verb classes and irregular verbs423object clitic from occurring after -mast or -nast, in the postconsonantal form -\t,
since geminated tt is audible word-finally after a V (as in FeSg suffix complex
-t-t after V-final noun stem). The absence of -\t after -maet or -naet is therefore
a morphophonological rule, deleting the (semantically meaningless) clitic after
a subject suffix ending in t.
For the R speaker, who was also checked carefully, the status of the object
clitic is quite different. For this speaker, -alle seems to have been reanalysed
as a simple perfective stem variant (used in the absence of a subject suffix).
As a consequence, 3MaSg clitic -\t is also absent from the paradigm, except
that it may be added optionally to the pronominally suffixed forms, denoting
the specific location. Some examples are in (425).

8.5.6.2497Participles with Future mär (ore)Another preverbal particle is the Future, which appears as ad (dialectally ar) in
positive utterances. The Future Negative is expressed in T-ka by u - m a r
(presumably fused from *wasr mar), in R and some other dialects by w $ r
followed by Future allomorph e. In effect, a d is confined to clause-initial
position and is replaced by mar or e when non-initial
For T-ka, the combinations of (noninitial) Future particle m a r with
participial endings are given in (522).
(522)Participial Forms of Future mar (T-ka)
MaSgFeSgPImar-aenmar-aetmar-aenCorresponding to T-ka mar-aen, I have recorded mare-n for T-md, both
m a d e - n and m a r - n for A-grm, and m a n - n (evidently assimilated from
*mar-n) for some Gao-area dialects.
Examples of the definite participial construction are in (523).

cases (523c-d).
When both Neg and Fut particles are present (future negative), the Neg
morpheme comes first (as usual). In T-ka, where Neg and Fut combine into the
fused form ü-mar, the participial endings are added to this. Hence MaSg and
PI u-mar-aen but 3FeSg ü-mar-aet. As in the preceding negative and future4988 Verbal derivationcases, the inflected verb may take a 3MaSg or 3FeSg prefix but takes no affix

3FeSgS-go.ShImpf]I have recorded dramatically different constructions for these future and
future negative participials for R and K. Here the noninitial Future particle is e
(allomorph he after a V-final demonstrative), and it patterns quite differently
from T-ka mar. The Participle ending is attached to the following (Shlmpf)
verb, not to the preverbal particle. In this R and Κ construction, clitics can
intervene between Neg waer and Future e, while the fused T-ka Fut Neg
complex ü-mar allows no intervening material. Examples are in (525).

Verbal morphologyThis chapter focuses on inflectable verb stems that occur in ""ordinary"" clauses.
This excludes verb forms that are confined to relative clauses, including
participles (i.e. subject relatives), on which see §8.5, and certain inflectable
verb steins (Resit and LoImpfP) that undergo ablaut modifications in definite
relative clauses (§3.5.3, §12.1).
As noted in §2, each regular verb has the set of stems in (302).
(302)Verb Stems
a. perfective system
PerfP [perfective positive]
PerfN [perfective negative] (after Neg waer)
Resit [resultative] (positive only)
b. short imperfective system
Shlmpf [short imperfective] (after Fut or complementizer)
Imprt [imperative] (in positive only)
c. long imperfective system
LoImpfP [long imperfective positive]
LoImpfN [long imperfective negative] (after Neg waer)
Prohib [prohibitive] (after Neg waer)These stems share a uniform set of subject prefixes and suffixes §7.4.1.
There are two exceptions. First, imperatives have an unaffixed 2Sg, and
special suffixed 2MaPl and 2FePl forms (§7.4.3). Second, certain verbs with
""adjectival"" sense have a special type of perfective stem (of probable nominal
origin) that can take subject suffixes but not subject prefixes (§7.4.2).
The morphological relationships among the stem types in (302) vary
depending on the type of verb, which is primarily determined by the basic
syllable shape of the stem, distinguishing short from full V ' s and in some
positions distinguishing geminate consonant clusters, represented as ""PP,"" and
nongeminate clusters, represented as ""PQ."" Where indexation is not needed I
use ""C"" for consonants, hence ""CC"" for clusters that may be geminate or nongeminate. In abstract representations of stems, ""v"" is a short vowel, ""υ"" is a
full vowel, and ""V"" can be either short or full. It is not necessary to mark
accents in these abstract lexical representations, since inflectable verb stems2947 Verbal morphologyacquire accent either by accent formative χ-pcl in ablaut (Resit, LoImpfP), or
by Default Accentuation (§3.3.1). Aside from differences among stem-shape
classes, e.g. -vPPvC-, -uPQu-, and -CvCvC-, there are also special features
associated with adjectival verbs.
This chapter is organized as follows. First, Augment -t of a large class of
V-final stems is discussed (§7.1). These are referred to throughout as augment
verbs, in contrast to unaugmented V-final stems. Then the stem categories in
(302) are discussed in turn, briefly describing the syntax and semantics of each
category, and extracting generalizations about ablaut morphology that apply
across stem-shape classes (§7.2). In §7.3.1 I focus in turn on each stem-shape
class, beginning with various types of (syllabically) light verbs and moving on
to heavy and superheavy stems (on the ligh/heavy distinction see §3.4.1.4). In
§7.3.2 I proceed to discuss verbs that have individual idiosyncrasies. There is
considerable duplication between §7.2 and §7.3, since they approach the same
morphological system from two different perspectives. In §7.4 I describe the
pronominal subject prefixes and suffixes.","[310, 311, 312, 313]"
"9.6.4Combinations of preverbsThe relative ordering in T-ka is Past + Neg + Fut. To my knowledge Past and
Fut do not co-occur, so the attested combinations are Past + Neg and Neg +
Fut.
Past + Neg is not particularly common, since the simple perfective is the
common translation equivalent of English past negatives ('he did not go', 'she
was not sick'). The combination ksela wasr plus PerfN stem (which is
sometimes homophous to the PerfP) is used to denote a temporally extended
negative state, and can be generalized as an experiential negation 'not ever'.
Examples of kaela waer and of the simple perfective negative are in (644.a-b).

There are two basic constructions for 'not yet'. The first is of the syntactic type
'not still', involving negation and har w-ά 'still' (see just above). The har w-ά
may be clause-initial or -final (705.a-b). The second construction also involves
a negation, but uses sasdder (dialectally saedden) '(not) yet' clause-finally
(705.c). The variation between saedder and saedden resembles that between
negative predicator wasdder and wasdden (633) (§9.5), though the dialectal
range of the rare variant ssedden is much more limited than than for the variant
wsedden.

waer ... mar, with the clitic intervening. (648.c) is like (648.b) except that we
get waer ... u-mar with the fused form ü - m a r after the clitic. In this case, the
fusion of ύ-mar is such that it can be taken as a variant Fut allomorph used in
negative contexts.
For R (which however prefers waer ... e) I have also heard a variant Neg +
Fut form a m m a r instead of ü-mar. This results in an even more opaque form
hardly worthy of hyphenation. An example is a m m a r i-saw 'he will not
drink'.
The Diebok dialect near Gao was not investigated in detail, but the two
examples in (649) were obtained for this dialect from literacy specialists in
Gao. It appears that - s a - is a Future element fused with Neg waer, much as
- m a r - is for T-ka. In (649.b), it appears that - s a - is reduced to -s- before a
V-initial verb, but the overall allomorphy and its morphosyntactic distribution
are not clear to me.

French verbs are not borrowed as inflectable verbs. Instead, the borrowed verb
stem is accompanied by the verb -vju- 'do' functioning as an auxiliary. The
borrowed stem generally ends in e, which can be taken as a composite of the
productive French infinitive -er, participial -e, ""vous"" form -ez, and perhaps
the imperfective (-ait, etc.). The borrowed verb functions as direct object of
-vju-. If the sense calls for a real object, this appears as a dative (650.a).

Clitics10.1 Sentential clitics
Clitics are normally realized at the end of the first word (perhaps a preverbal
particle or a verb) in the relevant clause (for occasional repetition of a
directional clitic on a noninitial word, see below). The clause onset for this
purpose excludes the following: a) topicalized NP or adverb (preverbal); b)
focalized NP or adverb; and c) the head noun in a definite relative (the
following demonstrative functions as clause-initial). Certain sentence-initial
particles like musam 'but' are also disregarded. When a preverbal particle
hosts a directional clitic, this clitic is optionally repeated on the following verb
as in (655) and (662) below, but other clitics are not doubled in this way.
Clitics include directionals (§10.2), object and dative pronominals (§10.3),
pronominal PPs, and (in extraction constructions) cliticized prepositions. For
details on the relative ordering of clitics, see §10.4.
The double symbol -\ is used to indicate the boundary between a clitic and
a preceding stem, suffix, or clitic. I use this since it can be typed within the
phonetic font used here and in the dictionary.","[612, 613, 614]"
"Disjunctive 'nor' in a parallel negated clause or phrase is waeld. In the
following examples, the negative elements are Neg waer (882.a) and ba-\0-s
'no longer' (882.b, cf. §13.6.7). The first negative phrase has the same form as
it would by itself; there is no anticipation of the paired following negative of

is evidently some intra-dialectal variation here. In the (i) version of each
example, Future e (or: he) is doubled, occurring once before and once after
Negative waer. The Future particle occurs only once in the other types, before
Neg in the (ii) examples and after it in the (iii) examples. The (iii) examples
appear to be most common for the R informant, and it is consistent with the
usual ordering (Neg Fut) in non-relative clauses. The (i) and (ii) types are
therefore anomalous. They may reflect difficulty in hearing Fut e before MaSg
subject prefix i- in (526.a.iii), a difficulty that can be resolved by adding
another (h)e before the Neg particle.
In any event, the forms of the verb are consistent in (526). The FeSg forms
have FeSg Participial suffix -aet, but no Participial suffix occurs on the verb in
the MaSg or PI constructions. One variant of the FeSg construction (526.b.ii)
also adds -aet to the Neg particle (waer-ast). The MaSg and PI add their
participial suffixes to the Neg particle (waer-aen).
For K-d, only one type of future negative participial clause was recorded
(527).

used in 'that' complements and long-distance relatives (§13.7). The same is
true of the indefinite participial in (532), where the clitic is hosted by a noun.

3MaSgS-sit.Reslt8.5.7Resit Participles with ""adjectival"" senseAs noted earlier, many word-families with adjectival sense include an inflected
intransitive verb ('be big', 'be red', etc.), which can also occur in participial
form. If the construction is definite (i.e. , when a demonstrative separates the
head noun from the participle), we get the same basic construction described in
earlier sections on definite relatives. However, such adjectival verbs occur
more commonly in the indefinite construction, with no demonstrative. While
PerfP and LoImpfP forms are elicitable, the common ""modifying adjective""
form is generally a Resit participle.
A number of these have irregularities, including differences in the Sg and
PI stem in the participles. Because of their text frequency, a generous set of
forms is collected together below. The FeSg forms are always based on the
same stem as the MaSg, with the same accentuation. Not all variants of the
inflected verb stems are shown.
In (533) I display examples involving regular verbs that allow subject
prefixes.","[518, 519, 520, 521]"
"7.2.2Perfective systemThe Perfective Positive (PerfP) is used for temporally bounded events in the
past (i.e. events that ended prior to the ""now"" of the speech act, or some other
contextually established deictic center). The PerfP is the basic form of the
perfective system, and the other two perfective-system stems are built on it.
The Resultative (Resit), which adds accent and length formatives to the
PerfP, is used when the perfective event results in a situation or state, and
depending on the verb can be translated as a stative present ('knows') or as a
perfect ('has already arrived'). It can often be translated loosely as present
progressive ('is red', 'is burning'), but this does not capture the actual
tense/aspect nuance of Tamashek, which specifies a situation or state that
results from an event or state that began earlier (and may or may not be
complete, depending on the verb).
The Perfective Negative (PerfN) is formed by adding an ablaut formative
changing ae in the PerfP to e. Except for light verbs ending in CvC, this
formative has no audible effect, in which case the PerfN is indistinguishable
from the PerfP. The PerfN is used, after Negative preverbal particle wser, to
negate either the PerfP or the Resit. It must directly follow wser with no
intervening material other than clitics.
Both the PerfP and the Resit have participial forms used in subject
relatives. The PerfN lacks its own participial form, since the relevant subject
relative is formed by adding a Participial ending directly to the Neg particle
preceding the PerfN verb.",[320]

As in regular inflection, the PerfN (whether or not homophonous to the
PerfP) negates both the PerfP and the Resit, so the examples in (517) could
also be glossed resultatively as e.g. 'she who has not (already) refused'.
If the verb begins in as or a full V, the only audible difference between
MaSg and PI subject constructions is in the demonstrative (518.a-c). The

"Another common 'maybe' construction involves t-arhd, which if so

"7.3.2.11ExistentialAocational 'be' (Vl)The defective verb -νΐΐυ- occurs only in the perfective system. In positive
utterances, Resit -alia- is normal, although PerfP -alia- is attested after Past
preverbal particle kaeld, see (424.g), below. In negatives, the stem appears as
(PerfN) -alia-. It may be translated 'exist', 'be present', or 'be here'. The
emphasis is on existence, or on presence as opposed to absence (in a
presupposed location such as 'here'). The locational element in translation ('be
here') is best considered a pragmatic implicature, and -νΐΐυ- is not used in
expressions like 'be in (a box, a city)' where the locational is part of the
argument frame. Unmarked time reference is to the present, or to a timeless
(gnomic) status, unless Past particle kaeld precedes the verb. These temporal
and aspectual features are mostly shared with 'be in' and 'have' (see just
below). For additional information on the morphosyntax of this verb see §9.3.",[440]
"13.3Jussive and subjunctive clauses (a-\d)maenna]
drought]This section turns to a-\d clauses that are subordinated to a controlling verb.
Positive jussives (quoted imperatives) are expressed with a main clause
containing -νηηυ- 'say', with or without an explicit dative, and a subordinated
clause beginning in phonetic [ad] with a S h l m p f verb, or a LoImpfP verb
denoting recurrent events. The d of [od] is dropped if a clitic is present. The
[ad] can, at first sight, be taken either as Future particle ad, or as the sequence
of minimal demonstrative ά and cliticized Comitative -\d, i.e. a-\d. The latter
analysis is shown to be correct for T-ka and most other dialects by the form of
negative subordinated clauses (a-\d waer ..., etc., see below).

normally takes a referentially empty 3MaSg object clitic (allomorphs -\tt, At,
-e), though the clitic is omitted in some combinations, the details varying
dialectally. See §7.3.2.11 for more on the forms.

-νΐΐυ- also occurs in a specialized adverbial construction translatable 'on
the near/far side of X'. Here we get a 3MaSg subject, a directional clitic
(Centripetal or Centrifugal), and either PerfP -alia- or Resit -alia- (the marked
accent of the latter would be overridden by that of the clitic). This is followed
by the spatial reference point X, which takes dative form (625). In (625.c), it

"A subject or object noun (but not both) can form an accentual phrase with
a preceding verb. Default and secondary accents are applied from right to left.
Thus, in (13), [anhsey-ajn medd-aen] is an accentual phrase, with a lexical
accent on the e of medd-asn and a secondary accent on the second syllable to
its left. In isolation, the verb is anhaey-aen with default accent on the
antepenult. If the noun medd-aen is omitted in (13), we would get [anhsey-asn
elu], where the object noun now forms an accentual phrase with the verb. Two
adjacent nouns are never grouped accentually, so as (13) stands elu has no
accentual interaction with medd-aen.
If the clause is future or negative, there is a preverbal particle (Future ad or
allomorph [including a-], or Negative wser), and any clitics attach to this
particle, hence [preverb(-\clitics) verb (subject) (object) ...]. In (14) I

"5.1.1.2ComparativesThe most common symmetrical comparative construction, glossable as 'X be
as [adjective] as Y \ involves the transitive verb -ujdvh- (PerfP -ojdaeh-). In
the absence of a specification, this verb can mean 'be equal to' or 'be as big
as'. It can be adapted to other adjectival qualities by adding an appropriate
specification ('X equals Y [with respect to\ strength'). The specifying noun
follows the verb, with no preposition. The Resit stem -ojdaeh- is usual in
positive comparatives. Some dialects have g for T-ka j.

"7.2 Stem categories
7.2.4323Alternative 1PI hortative construction using Imprt stemIn the regular hortative construction with suffix P)-et just described, the full
set of entities exhorted or permitted to undertake the activity is indexed in the
grammatical subject. For example, if there is one speaker and one addressee,
'let's go!' has 1P1 subject.
In the alternative construction to which we now turn, a 1P1 dative clitic is
added to an imperative. The overt subject of the imperative is Sg or PI
depending on the number of persons in question, excluding the speaker. This
imperative verb is followed by a 1 PI dative clitic, even if only two persons
(speaker and addressee) are present. The 1P1 dative can therefore be taken as
subsuming the 2nd person subject of the imperative. In this construction, 'let's
go!' for two persons (1st dual inclusive) is expressed as 'go!-Sg for us'. On the
other hand, 'let's go!' for three or more persons is expressed as 'go!-Pl for us',
the imperative being 2MaPl or 2FePl according to the sex of the addressees
(and any other included non-speaker referent). Data in (327) are valid for at
least T-ka and R dialects.

7.2.5Long imperfective systemThis system includes the LoImpfP, its negation the LoImpfN, and another stem
that I call Prohibitive]. Both the LoImpfN and the Prohib are used after Neg
particle waer. The Prohib stem is similar but (except for 3FeSg subject) not
identical in form to a stripped-down version of the LoImpfP stem, with ablaut
length formative χ-pcl erased, that is used in definite relative clauses (§3.5.3).
The long imperfective stems are built from the basic form of a given verb
stem by adding the ablaut melodies and local formatives listed in (328). The3247 Verbal morphologylocal formatives in (328.d) are limited to the LoImpfP, while those in (328.b-c)

3MaSgS-kill.PerfP-\3MaP10-\Dat-lSg
'He killed them-Ma for me.' (T-md)Here the 3MaPl object has a reduced, arguably V-initial allomorph (/-aen-/)
after the V-final verb (-sgra-), and we get VV-Contraction with /a-ae/
surfacing as e. It appears that this ""fusion"" of object clitic with stem-final V
permits an exception to the first person first rule. However, even here, some
speakers including my primary T-ka informant strongly prefer to allow the first
person first rule to apply, so instead of (686) they have i-qYCi-\0-hi-\taen, with
3MaP10 -\taen at the end.
In the combinations not involving a 1st person clitic, the common
sequence is dative-object. In other words, the object-2 slot is favored for
object clitics. One can account for the data by recognizing (684.b) as the basic
order, while allowing for subsequent ""fronting"" of a lSg or 1P1 form to initial
position within the clitic cluster. However, there are also some attestations of
object-dative order even when a 1st person clitic is not involved, so the
ordering is not rigid.
In the uncommon case where two objects and one dative co-occur, the two
object clitics flank the dative clitic, so we get object-dative-object order.
Some further examples each involving one dative clitic and one object
clitic are in (687). The verb glossed 'kill' can also mean 'hit hard, whack'.

TextThe following text was recorded from a T-ka speaker in 2002. It was
transcribed from dictation, allowing the speaker to repeat the sentences. My
other textual material is transcribed from recorded dialogues, and the reason
for choosing monologue dictation in this case was to allow the speaker to
smooth out the accentual phrasing (which can be ragged in spontaneous
dialogue due to the fact that phrasal accents work from right to left. Where
they are clear, I use brackets here to indicate the accentual phrases of more
than one word, not (as in the grammar proper) to indicate syntactic bracketing.

"7.3.2.13'have' (V/JThe possessive verb is -νΐυ-. Like -vhu- 'be in' (see just above), it is used only
in the perfective system, and it is most often reduced to -1υ-. It is a simple
transitive as in English. Like 'be' and 'be in' (§7.3.2.11-12, above), it occurs
only in perfective forms. In positive main clauses it occurs in the Resit, and
negative counterparts have the PerfN. The PerfP is found in subordinated
clauses. As with 'be' and 'be in', unmarked time reference is present or
timeless, while past time may be specified by preposing kaela.

Resit). In a relative construction meaning 'a few X ' s \ the PerfP occurs in
(431.a). The quantified-over noun is the source of subject agreement, but the
actual noun is treated accentually as an adjunct rather than being part of the
accentual phrase with the verb. In (431.b), we have a subject relative

respects. The prototypical transitive concepts, involving creation or physical
impact, like 'make', 'hit', 'twist', and 'cut', are simple transitives. So are
perception verbs like 'see'. Somewhat more interesting are the transitives
listed in (609).
(609)Transitive Verbs
-vkki>
-vflu-vwvr-vhi>
-νΐυ-νΐΐυ-vbu-'go to'
'leave, go from'
'be on (sth)'
'be in' (usually Resit -aha-)
'have' (usually Resit -aid-)
'exist' (usually Resit -slid-)
'lose'-vkku- 'go to' is the 'go' verb used with a specified destination, which is
expressed as the direct object. A PerfP example with object NP is t-akka
e-haen 'she went to the house'. Note that the object NP has no locative
preposition. The destination can also be expressed as an object clitic:
Skkas-nAt 'they-Ma went to him'. The verb can be passivized: 0-aetw-aekka
'he was gone to'. A reciprocal version: aenm-äekkas-n 'they went to each
other'. A different verb -vjlu- expresses intransitive 'go, go away, depart' with
no specified destination.
Likewise, -vfvl- 'go from, leave' takes an object NP denoting the
departure point. Example: i-faelAad baemasko 'he left Bamako (on the way5769 Verb phrases and other predicationshere)'. -\ad(d) here is the Centripetal clitic. This transitive verb, along with the
use of preposition r o r 'chez, at the place of in composite 'from X to Y'
adverbial expressions (§6.7), makes an ablative preposition unnecessary, and
Tamashek has none.
-vwvr- 'be on' takes a direct object, rather than a PP, to specify the object
or surface on which the subject rests. In the (positive) stative sense it occurs in
the Resit form -awdr-. An example with full noun as object: i-war t-s-hun-t
'he is on the stone'. An example with object clitic is i-wdr-\t 'he is on it-Ma'.
The passive sounded dubious to informants, but I was able to elicit a reciprocal
-nvm-vwvr-, 3MaPl PerfP: aenm-aewaer-aen 'they were on each other'.
-vhi> 'be in' takes an object NP denoting the object, region, or space in
which the subject is located. Example: n-aha e-haen 'we are in the house'. The
verb can also be used in extended senses of the type 'be produced (caused) by'.
Example: i-h-\e a-s-assuhu η Vrazzej 'strengthening of the livestock is in
(=is brought about by) it (=a pasture grass sp.)'. In positive main clauses it is
always in the Resit form, -vhu- is a defective verb with no imperfective stems
(§7.3.2.12). It occurs in many idiomatic phrases, for example with a nominal
denoting a personality trait or other characteristic as subject, and a human NP
as object, e.g. t-ah-\e ""t-ae-haeke 'he is generous' (lit. ""giving is in him"").
Another defective transitive verb is -νΐυ- 'have', the ordinary verb of
possession. It too appears (in positive sentences) in the Resit form -aid-. See
§7.3.2.14. One can extract the object to give sentences like e-haen miAtH-las-n
'the house [topic], who has it?' (i.e. 'to whom does the house belong?'). For an
alternative construction 'X be mine' etc. see §9.4.
Still another defective transitive verb is -νΐΐυ-, which combines with a
referentially empty 3MaSg object clitic to form an existential sense 'exist,
there is/are'. See §9.3, below, and §7.3.2.11 for the irregular morphology and
the dialectally variable omission or reinterpretation of the 3MaSg clitic.
The sense 'get lost' is expressed as (PerfP) 0-aeba-, with invariant 3MaSg
subject form (here 0 - before a) plus an object NP or clitic denoting the person
or object lost. Example: 0-aeba-\taet 'she got lost', also a common polite
expression for 'she died'. The 3MaSg subject is audible as i- in LoImpfP

"2404 Nominal and pronominal morphologyProximal demonstrative 'this' (near speaker) requires addition of suffix
-hi (w-a-hi etc.)· A Near-Distant demonstrative (e.g. near addressee or a short
distance from speaker and addressee) is expressed by the series ending in -di.
(For the R dialect I recorded wae-di etc. with ae instead of a.) This can also be
used anaphorically to denote something not physically visible or otherwise
present. While MaPl w-i-di and FePl t-i-di are clearly tri-morphemic, MaSg
wa-di and FeSg ta-di are more ambiguous; one could take the schwa as part of
the gender marker, as epenthetic, or as an irregular reduction of the -a- seen in
the unmarked and proximal demonstratives. A specifically Distant
demonstrative is expressed by -en, which contracts with the preceding V (Sg
-en from /-d-en/, PI -1-n from /-1-en/). The normally Proximal suffix -hi can be
added to -di or -en, but these combinations are uncommon.
The w- of Ma[sculine] forms supports Prasse's view that the MaSg
nominal prefixes α-, e-, and ss- on nouns were originally *w-a- and *w-ae-.
The most common way to indicate anaphoric (=discourse-deictic) status
(e.g. 'this/that same one we were talking about') is by adding Anaphoric
suffix -daer to the demonstrative, often (but not always) the unmarked
demonstrative: w-a-daer, less often w-en-daev, etc. However, (214.a) also
shows a special Recent Anaphoric demonstrative, with ending -nnin, used to
denote something mentioned earlier, but not the currently active ""topical""
referent. In context it can sometimes be glossed as 'the former', as when
discourse referents R and S have just been introduced (in that order) and the
speaker then wishes to index R. It can also be glossed 'the preceding one'. It
has a variant -ndln, which is more transparently related to and! 'before'. The
form andln is also used as a postnominal demonstrative (see below, §4.3.3).
For invariant ά in connection with focalization, see §12.2.
Another set of demonstratives is used to provide heads to indefinite
relative clauses that lack noun heads (§8.5.4, §12.1). The forms are repeated
here as (215). The form i is also used in relatives (arguably definite, though
there is no definite/indefinite distinction here) whose head is a 1st or 2nd
person pronoun (§12.1).

"3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes
There is a pervasive interaction between ""syntax"" and ""phonology"" in
Tamashek, which allows us to make a strong case for a morphological view of
the grammar. That is, instead of a model of grammar that starts with an
autonomous abstract syntax, and then allows a phonological module to execute
more or less natural phonological adjustments to the outputs of the syntax,
Tamashek lends itself to a model where grammatical categories, linear
ordering, and phonology (segmental, accentual, and ablaut) are inextricably
intertwined.
The common denominator of the phenomena treated in this section is a
repeating ""figure"" of the type [X+Y...], where X is some phrase-initial word or
particle, and Y is a word whose phonological form is modified in this syntactic
context. The modifications of Y are mostly, but not always, interpretable as
reductions. The [X+Y...] groupings do not correspond to phrasal boundaries in
current formal syntactic models. For example, the combination [verb
+ subject] (excluding object) is not recognized as a phrase in any syntactic
theory I know of. Therefore even the phrasal bracketings relevant to the
morphophonological processes described here are idiosyncratic to Tamashek.
On top of this, the phrasal bracketings are not identical to those needed for
phrasal accent. For example, [verb + object] counts as a phrase for
accentuation, as does [verb + subject], but of the two only [verb + subject}
shows Prefix Reduction in the noun. Therefore converting ""syntactic"" phrases
to ""prosodic"" phrases by rebracketing, as a way of explaining how Tamashek
microsyntactic organization diverges from natural syntactic groups, will not3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes147work, at least if ""prosodic"" phrases are defined in a manner relevant to actual
prosody.","[165, 166]"

Τgemination of second stem C
-t- prefixc.χ-flengthening of final VThe LoImpfN, like the Prohib, lacks two key ablaut features that
characterize the LoImpfP: the marked accent (χ-pcl) and lengthening of the
first postconsonantal V (χ-pcl). The LoImpfN also imposes its own invariant
<H> melody, whereas the LoImpfP and Prohib share the characteristic long
imperfective melody (<H>, <L>, or <H L>) of the particular stem-shape class.
If the characteristic melody is <L> or <H L>, the <H> melody of the LoImpfN
is distinctive, so the LoImpfN is audibly distinct from the Prohib. If the
characteristic melody is already <H>, the LoImpfN and Prohib stems are
indistinguishable.
Examples of the LoImpfN are given in (338), with the corresponding
LoImpfP shown for comparison. The LoImpfN forms in (338.a) are unique to7.2 Stem categories335the LoImpfN, while those in (338.b-d) are identical in form to Prohib stems.
The cases in (338.c) involve three-way LoImpfN = Prohib = LoImpfP
homophony at the segmental level, but the LoImpfP has fixed accent while the
LoImpfN and Prohib are unaccented (and so permit a default accent on a
syllable or on the preverbal Neg particle). Thus note the accents in i-t-issl 'he
runs' and its negation war 1-t-isal 'he doesn't run'. (338.d) is like (338.c) but
also involves Final-CC Schwa-Insertion (44) (i.e., ^syllabification), and in
T-ka this shifts accent onto the inserted schwa (§3.3.2).

-t-idaw (/-t-idwi-/)The <H> melody of the LoImpfN is pervasive in (338). The LoImpfN has
no ablaut accent, and it preserves the underlying length of all stem V's.
However, χ-f does lengthen the final V in trisyllabic or longer LoImpfN stems
(as in the LoImpfP and Prohib), e.g. -t-adubun- from stem -dubvn- 'marry'.
If the inflected word containing the LoImpfN stem has fewer than three
syllables (or fewer than two, if a stem-final V has been deleted), a phrasal
accent appears on the preceding Negative waer, as in wser 0-baddad 'she does
not stand up' (with deleted /t-/ 3FeSg subject prefix).
In (338.d), the final /CC/ (after Stem-Final i/A-Deletion) is resyllabified,
and in T-ka has final-syllable accent (§3.3.2). Since the two known verbs of
type (338.d), i.e. stems with shape -uPQu- where Q is a sonorant and Ρ is not,
have characteristic long imperfective <H> melody, the result is three-way
homophony between LoImpfN, LoImpfP, and Prohib. When a V-initial suffix
or clitic is added, the forms in (338.d) are realized as LoImpfN and Prohib
unaccented -t-ilw- and -t-ldw-, theoretically distinct from LoImpfP -t-ilw- and
-t-idw- with marked accents, but the suffix or clitic V counts in Default
Accentuation, so the underlying accentual distinction is overridden: t-ilwa-n
'they-Ma are spacious', negated as war t-ilwa-n, with /-t-ilwi-/ and /-t-llwi-/,
respectively, plus 3MaPl -aen. Examples of the LoImpfN are in (339).

"7.2.5.1Long Imperfective Positive stem (LoImpfP)The LoImpfP is the only stem in the imperfective system, aside from the
uncommon long imperative, that can be used clause-initially (i.e. without
preverbal particles): i-jdll 'he goes (regularly)'. It can denote recurring or
habitual events, or a (present) progressive, as in i-t-ihnaffi-t 'he often moans'
or 'he is moaning' and i-t-umad (variant i-t-imud) 'he prays (regularly)' or 'he
is praying'. I noted above that the Resit, which is part of the perfective system,
may also be used in present stative/resultative sense and for some verbs can be
glossed with the English progressive: i-ttas 'he is sleeping' (better: 'he went to
sleep and is still asleep'; root Vds). The LoImpfP may be preceded by Future
ad to denote future recurrent events: ad i-jdll 'he will go (regularly)'; this
combination is uncommon, the usual future being a d plus the Shlmpf. The
LoImpfP is replaced by the LoImpfN when directly preceded by Negative
waer.
The LoImpfP is built from the basic lexical form of the stem by the full set
of ablaut features listed in (328), above. The melody, which is diagnostic of
the characteristic long imperfective melody (also used in the Prohib), depends
on the stem-shape type. Except for the type -(t-)awwdt- 'hits' with
compositive <H L> melody, all T-ka verbs have either stem-wide <L> or7.2 Stern categories331stem-wide <H> as the characteristic long imperfective melody, but eastern
dialects preserve some cases of <L H> with V-final non-augment verbs.
All LoImpfP stems have one of the two consonantal increments, Γ-c2 or T,
and for some speakers (or dialects) the type -(t-)aww0t 'hits' has both.

"3.5.2
3.5.2.1Verbs after particles
Verbs after Future particlesThe (non-imperative) Shlmpf (=short imperfective, §7.2.3.1) stem is always a
""dependent"" form. It is used chiefly after Future particle ad (or variant,
§9.6.3), whether or not a Negative particle is also present. An example is ad
0-aeks 'he will eat'.
The Shlmpf is usually just the ""basic"" (i.e. minimal) form of the verb stem
(e.g. -vCCvC-) plus a melody (<L>, <H>, or <L H>). The Shlmpf lacks the
special ablaut components of the long imperfective (accent and lengthening of
V's, gemination of C's, addition of prefixal -t-).
Since the Shlmpf is not obviously connected to any other specific stem, no
(morpho-)phonological derivation will be offered here to ""derive"" the Shlmpf3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes151stem. The use of a stripped-down, minimal verb form after the Future particle
is roughly similar to the use of phonologically reduced noun and verb forms in
Y position in [X Y...] syntactic combinations. However, the combination of
Future particle plus Shlmpf does not fit the prototypical [X Y...] pattern, which
requires adjacency of X and Y. By contrast, the Shlmpf stem need not be
adjacent to the Future particle. This is because a combination [Future +
Shlmpf clause] may be followed by a second Shlmpf clause without repeating
the Future particle (§13.4).","[169, 170]"
