"206Commands1) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a word
As discussed in Section 9.4.2, the negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) may be used to negate specific
words such as adjectives or adverbs. The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) is added to an
adjective to give a negative answer to a question, to intensify antithesis or to provide an antonym for an
adjective which does not have an antonym.
Examples
1. totojuli
2. kakpijuli
3. tikalbal
becomes
tikajul‗not small (emphatic: large)‘
‗not at all bitter (sweet)‘
‗nearby‘
‗not near (far)‘2) Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) „no‟ negating a sentence
A Kuna sentence is negated by adding the basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i) ‗no‘ to the verb.96
The long form has a more emphatic connotation than the short. The suffix is attached to the verb stem or
immediately following the aspect suffix, for example, the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2.1).
Examples
1. An immal pakchul.
2. An mol peichuli.97
3. An mol peichul.
4. An nan takchajul.
5. Anmal yannu gwen takchajulmal.
6. An nebijul.","[218, 219]"

4. Machiga uko.
‗Please give (it) to the boy.‘
5. Mani chabo-o.
‗Please put away the money.‘15.4.2 Negatives (Ex. 22–30)
The basic and most common negative word in Kuna is chul/chuli ‗no‘ (see 3.4.1.). This word may also be used
as a negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul94 attached to certain words, phrases or sentences. There are also other
negative words which are used in certain situations.
15.4.2.1 Basic negative word chuli „no‟
The basic negative word chuli/chul ‗no‘ may be used alone as a negative exclamation, or it may be used within
a sentence. Chuli/chul ‗no‘ is used to respond negatively to a question asked, or a statement made to negate a
fact or action mentioned in the/a previous sentence, or to negate a certain adverb or adjective used in a/the
previous sentence.",[217]
"1) Forms of the basic negative word chuli „no‟
When used alone, the basic negative word chuli ‗no‘ may occur in one of three forms:
a) Chul ‗no‘
Chul ‗no‘ is the most common form of the basic negative word. It is used in response to a question which
requires a negative answer. In other words, it is used to deny that the action in the question is going to take
place.",[217]
"‗The three leaders went.‘9.4.2 Negation of adjectives (Ex. 6)
Although most negated adjectives function as do negated adjectives in English and Spanish, there is an
idiomatic use of the negated adjective which is unique in Kuna (discussed below in 2). With few exceptions, the
negation of an adjective varies according to whether the adjective ends in a vowel or a consonant.
9.4.2.1 Formation of negated adjectives
Negated adjectives are formed by the use of the negative suffix: -chuli/-zhuli/-juli.",[119]
"‗The fish is small.‘
‗The fish is not small.‘
‗That fish is not small.‘Exercise 22. Chul ‗no‘ denial stimulus-response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student replies denying the statement.
ExamplesTeacher: Uade, totó.
Student: Uadin, toto chul.
1. Uade, totó.
‗That fish is small.‘
2. Molde, muis.
‗That cloth is cheap.‘
3. Manide, unni.
‗That money is enough.‘
4. Akande, nued.
‗That axe is good.‘
5. Ulde, tummad.
‗That canoe is big.‘15.4.2.2 Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i)
The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhuli/-jul(i) may be added to certain words in order to negate the word itself
or it may be used to negate an entire sentence.
95This construction is the negation of the adjective and does not carry the antithetic connotation of the suffixed word (see
9.4.2.3).",[218]
"‗I am not going to go.‘
‗I didn‘t eat (any) food.‘
‗I didn‘t buy cloth.‘

"15.4 Grammar
15.4.1 Commands: Direct/Polite (Ex. 3–21)
As it has already been expressed, commands or requests vary in force. The relative force of the command is not
only conveyed by intonation, as seen in Section B, but is also expressed by the grammatical structure chosen.
There are three degrees of forcefulness in Kuna commands: 1) polite command, 2) strong command, and 3)
very polite command.
The three degrees of commands may be expressed in singular form or group form and each may be positive or
negative.
15.4.1.1 Polite commands
Polite commands in Kuna are used when the speaker is directing an order to someone of equal status or where
the difference in status is overlooked to assure compliance with the command. The polite form is also used
when a situation is not urgent. It is the most common command form in Kuna and parallels the Spanish/English
command, Hágame el favor de... ‗Please ...‘.",[207]
"‗Let‘s go!‘
‗Let‘s get out of the way!‘
‗Let‘s listen to the chief!‘
‗Let‘s take (them) to the meeting house!‘
‗Let‘s clean the town!‘Exercise 19. Inclusive polite command frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
ExampleTeacher: Nemalo.
Student: Nemalo.
1. Nemalo.
‗Let‘s go.‘
2. Aptamalo.
‗Let‘s wait.‘
3. Arbamalo.
‗Let‘s work.‘
4. Itomalo.
‗Let‘s listen.‘
5. Aknirmalo.
‗Let‘s get out of the way.‘15.4.1.6 Negative commands
In Kuna, negative commands are given by either the use of a negative command word or by using melle ‗don‘t‘
before any command form.",[216]
"1) Negative command words
There are several words in Kuna which may be used in isolation and which are strong negative commands.
These negative command words are used in the same situations as their English/Spanish counterparts.
Examples
1. ¡Melle!
2. ¡Mellema!
3. ¡Kusma!
4. ¡Ogus!",[216]
"2) Negative desiderative action yapa „don‟t want to‟
As has been mentioned (see 15.4.2.2.2, Example 6), a desiderative action may be negated by adding the
basic negative suffix -chul/-zhul/-jul to the verb. The desiderative action may also be negated by use of an
adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ in the adverbial position after the subject and before the object, if there is one.
The adverb yapa ‗don‘t want to‘ has a stronger negative connotation than does the desiderative action
suffix -bi/-pi and -chul/-jul.
ExampleAn yapa mol pak.",[220]
"‗You took my axe!‘
‗No (I did nothing of the kind)!‘2) Basic negative word used in a sentence
Any form of the basic negative word chul/chuli/chula ‗no‘ may be used in a sentence to deny that an
adverb or adjective used in the/a previous sentence is valid. In this construction, the sentence is reiterated.
The subject must be emphasized by the addition of the topic marking suffix -din/-tin or by the use of the
demonstrative adjective we ‗that‘. A form of the word chul/chuli/chula is used at the end of the sentence
to negate the adjective/adverb.
Examples
1. Uade, totó.
2. Uadin, toto chul.95
or
We ua, toto chul.",[218]
"15.4 Grammar2074. An mani pei.
‗I want money.‘
5. An karpa chobcha.
‗I made a basket.‘
Note that s + ch/j = ch, for example, chwas + -jul = chwachul.
15.4.2.3 Other negative words
Several other words used in a sentence give the sentence a negative meaning.","[219, 220]"
"‗Is Peter going to Pucuro?‘
‗No!‘c) Chula ‗no‘
Chula ‗no‘ is a very rare form of the basic negative word. It is used in reference to an action of the past
and parallels the English construction, ―never, not a chance.‖ It is often used as a response to consistent
teasing or persistent accusation and gives the response the flavor of ―not only is that not true, it never was
true either!‖
Examples
1. ¡An akande, pedin tar chus!
2. ¡Chula!",[218]
"2) Chunna
Chunna ‗Really!‘ parallels the English usage fairly closely.
11.4.3.4 Negative conversation sustainer responses
Sometimes a conversation sustainer is a negative response.",[146]
"‗Don‘t!‘
‗Don‘t, I said!‘
‗Stop it!‘
‗That‘s enough!‘2) Negative commands
Any command may be made negative by placing the word melle ‗don‘t‘ before the command.",[216]
"1) Negation of adjectives ending in a consonant
Adjectives that end in a consonant are negated by use of the negative forms -chuli/-zhuli following the
adjective.
Examples
1a. chered
b. cheredzhuli
2a. nued
b. nuedzhuli‗old‘
‗not old‘
‗good‘
‗not good‘2) Negation of adjectives ending in a vowel
Adjectives that end in a vowel are negated by the addition of -juli to the adjective.
Examples
1a. kollo
b. kollojuli
2a. toto
b. totojuli‗ripe‘
‗not ripe‘
‗small‘
‗not small‘3) Exception in negated adjective formation
Two common exceptions in the formation of negated adjectives ending in a consonant involve the words
tummad ‗big‘ and muis ‗cheap‘. In the case of the former, the consonant is dropped and the negative
suffix -juli is added to the adjective. In the case of the latter, s + ch becomes d.
Examples
1a. tummad/tummadi
b. tummajuli‗big‘
‗not big‘9.4 Grammar107‗inexpensive‘
‗not inexpensive‘2a. muis
b. muiduli9.4.2.2 Common significance of negated adjectives
The most common meaning of a negated adjective is similar to the meaning of the negated adjective in
English/Spanish.
Examples
1a. istar
‗bad‘
b. istarchuli
‗not bad‘
2a. olobi
‗empty‘
b. olobijuli
‗not empty‘
When it has this meaning, the first syllable of the negative suffix tends to be stressed.
Exampleolobijúli‗not empty‘9.4.2.3 Idiomatic use of negated adjectives
Sometimes the use of a negated adjective does more than simply negate an attribute. When a person chooses to
use the negated form of certain adjectives in preference to an existing antonym, a very intense antithesis is
communicated. In this case, the use of the negated adjective completely eliminates any characteristic of the
concept negated.
Examples
1. iche
‗a little‘
2. ichejuli
‗not a little (a lot)‘
In this construction, the syllable preceding the negative suffix tends to be stressed.
Example
ichéjuli
‗not a little (a lot)‘
The intensification of antithesis is a phenomenon which occurs only with certain adjectives. Some adjectives
that are used to intensify antithesis are in the following list.
Examples
1. totojuli
2. purwijuli
3. tutujuli
4. tinnajuli
5. karkijuli
6. muiduli
7. ichejuli
8. tikajuliDirect Translation

The teacher says Sentence 1. The student responds by repeating the modified noun with the negated form of the
adjective and omitting the verb used in Sentence 1. The succeeding sentences are drilled in a similar fashion.
ExamplesTeacher: Ul toto nai.
Student: Ul totojuli.
Teacher: Win purwi pukwa.
Student: Win purwijuli.
1. Ul toto nai.
‗A small boat is (there).‘
2. Win purwi pukwa.
‗Tiny beads are (sitting) (there).‘108Basic Health/Medical Discussion‗The house is (sitting) nearby.‘

"1) Negative command melle „don‟t‟
The negative command melle ‗don‘t‘ is discussed in Section 15.4.1.6.",[220]
"‗He/she is still away.‘
‗Is father home?‘

The teacher selects a sentence from the list below and says it. The student replies with the appropriate negative
form.",[221]
"205‗Are you going?‘
‗No.‘b) Chuli ‗no‘
Chuli ‗no‘ is a more emphatic form of the basic negative word and is used as a more emphatic denial in
response to the same situations for which you would reply with chul ‗no‘.
Examples
1. ¿Pedro Pucurche ne?
2. ¡Chuli!",[218]
"‗I want to go.‘
‗I want to eat fish.‘
‗I want to talk to the chief.‘
‗I want to repair the canoe.‘
‗I want to have my hair cut.‘3) Negative adverb yo „not yet‟
The negative adverb yo ‗not yet‘ or ‗before he/she/it (had) ...‘ is used as an adverb in a subordinate
sentence. Yo ‗not yet‘ is when the action in the independent sentence precedes that of the subordinate
sentence. That is to say, Kuna negates an action by using yo ‗not yet‘ to indicate the concept that before
something happened, the action in the independent sentence took place.
ExampleAn yo nadgu, an mas kucha. ‗Before I left, I ate (some) food.‘Exercise 27. Yo ‗not yet‘ stimulus response drill
The teacher gives the sentence. The student responds using the yo form of the subordinate sentence.",[220]

ExampleTeacher: An nebi.
Student: An yapa ne.

3. An saglabak chunmabi.
4. An ul nudabi.
5. An chagla chikpi.",[220]
"‗I still have not eaten.‘
‗Are you all ready?‘
‗Not yet.‘
‗Is father home?‘
‗He is still delayed.‘Exercise 28. Ampayo ‗not yet‘ negative adverb stimulus response drill
The teacher selects a question and asks it. The student replies using the ampayo ‗not yet‘ negative adverb.
ExampleTeacher: ¿Pedin pato ne?
Student: Andin ampayo ne.
1. ¿Pedin pato ne?
‗Are you going already?‘
2. ¿Pedin pato mol pakcha?
‗Have you already bought cloth?‘
3. ¿Pedin pato pel apchos?
‗Have you already read it all?‘
4. ¿Pedin pato mas kucha?
‗Have you already eaten (food)?‘
5. ¿Pedin pato mas tus?
‗Have you already cooked the food?‘Exercise 29. Ampa owed ‗still delayed‘ negative adverb frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student replies with the frame; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student
replies with the frame, etc.
ExampleTeacher: ¿Pab mai?
Student: Ampa owed.
Frame Ampa owed.
1. ¿Pab mai?
2. ¿Nande?
3. ¿Machide pato noni?
4. ¿Mu chi?
5. Kilde Pucur akar noni?",[221]
"Teacher: Machi nadgu an mas kucha.
Student: Machi yo nadgu an mas kucha.

‗When the plane arrived, the boy went to the airstrip
(and back).‘
An tian omosgu an yannu takcha.
‗When I reached the stream, I saw the peccaries.‘
An nadel an mol pako.
‗When I leave, I will buy cloth.‘4) Negative adverb ampa „still‟
The adverb ampa ‗still‘ may be used to compound with the adverb yo ‗not yet‘ to form the negative
expression ampayo ‗still not‘. It may also be used in conjunction with the word owed ‗away/delayed‘ to
form the negative expression ampa owed ‗still delayed‘. Ampayo and ampa owed may be used to
indicate that an action has still not happened. It may be used in answer to the question, ―Are you ready?‖
Examples
1. Andin ampayo mas kun.
2a. ¿Pedin pato ogus?
b. Ampayo.
3a. ¿Pabde mai?
b. Ampa owed.",[221]
"‗I don‘t want to buy cloth.‘Exercise 25. Yapa negative desiderative action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.
ExampleTeacher: An yapa ne.
Student: An yapa ne.
1. An yapa ne.
2. An yapa mantur kun.
3. An yapa mol pak.
4. An yapa ina kop.
5. An yapa wartiku.",[220]
"‗Peter, I would like it if you would give me the medicine.‘3) Questioning request
When the speaker is not sure whether or not the listener can meet a request, he uses a questioning request.
This construction is formed by using the word wis ‗a little‘ with the suffix -ji following the future suffix.
A question intonation pattern is used (see 3.2.3). The use of -ji expects a positive (yes) answer.
Example¿An wis pentakoji?",[213]
"9.4 Grammar
Adjectives
Adjectives in Kuna, as in Spanish and English, are modifiers of a person or object and are used in conjunction
with the noun in order to describe it more fully. Most Kuna adjectives are part of a noun phrase and convey a
concept similar to the English/Spanish adjectival concept. Since some aspects of negation of adjectives and of
Kuna color are unique, they are described apart from the general discussion on adjectives. The formation of
attributive and existence sentences is also unique.
9.4.1 Word order of a noun phrase (Ex. 4–5)
A noun phrase may consist of a noun, adjective and suffix, or of a noun modifying another noun.
9.4.1.1 Position of adjective in noun phrase
In Kuna, unlike English, the adjective is placed after the noun.
ExampleKarpa tummad chi.",[117]

A. Learning Outside the Classroom
The lessons in this grammar were designed mainly for classroom use. For the student who is learning the
language living among the people, or for those who wish extra or further study of the language, the questions
arise:
1. ―How do I learn outside of the classroom?‖
2. ―How do I go beyond the information in these lessons?‖ (The learner will inevitably find that he wants to
know much more on some topics.)
This appendix is an attempt to answer these questions.
1. Goal of language learning
The ultimate goal of language learning is to be completely bilingual; to be able to say anything you want to
express with all the nuances of meaning and shades of emotion with as much facility as you can in your first
language (mother tongue). Although few people really achieve this goal, it is something for which we should all
aim. However, for our encouragement along the way, there are various stages (levels) of achievement. The
following is one scheme:
Stage 1: When you are able to greet people and say goodbye.
Stage 2: When you are also able to exchange pleasantries.
Stage 3: When you are able to parrot fixed phrases, dealing with essential needs such as food, shelter, a guide,
directions, basic buying and selling.
Stage 4: When you are able to communicate effectively in the specialized areas where you have most contact
such as medical, trade, teaching or work projects.
Stage 5: When you are able to communicate, generally, in all common aspects of everyday life with a limited
number of verb aspects (tenses).
Stage 6: When you are able to control reasonably well most normal grammatical relationships such as
cause-effect, time, location, condition, purpose, ability, possibility and motion verbs.
Stage 7: When you are fluent in any non-abstract area up through Stage 6 and reasonably control focus and
emphasis.
Stage 8: When you are able to talk about the abstract, present an argument, use figures of speech, etc.
Stage 9: When you are able to discuss emotions, values ,and able to discuss life from the Kuna philosophical
viewpoint.
Goal: Absolute bilingualism.
2. Problem of adult language learning
A child will learn three or four languages without difficulty. Any new sound, word or grammatical construction
gets added to his repertoire. It will take him a while to separate out the systems of each language entirely. This
he will do provided he is exposed to environments where only one system is present. (Otherwise, he fails and
this leads to the formation of a Creole.)
By adulthood, however, the limited repertoire of sounds, words and grammatical systems of the mother tongue
has become so habitual (automatic) that they have formed almost a closed system. It takes will power,
determination and effort to learn new distinctions, new patterns, and new words. Adults do not enjoy repeating,
repeating and repeating things. But this is what it takes for the new sounds, words, and grammatical patterns to
become automatic. This is the only way to become fluent.
Now, there are ways of making the repetition more palatable, e.g., It is much better to ―become fluent‖ in a
prepared conversation by visiting a dozen homes and saying it in each home, than saying it to yourself twelve
times at your desk. (Besides, hopefully, the people you visit will correct you.)
307308Language Learning3. Speaking a language
In order to speak a language, you have to ―think‖ that language. You need to ―see‖ in that language and you
need to ―visualize‖ in that language. You should never translate into that language from the mother tongue or
bridge language. To illustrate this, when you see:
Figure 9.you think ulu, not ―canoe‖.
When you visualize:
Figure 10.you think An immal amine, not ―I‘m going to hunt.‖
You should never translate ―I‖ as ani, ―am going to‖ as -ne, or ―hunt‖ as ami, because often you will end up
with a mismatch, such as An (omitted) amine in which immal ‗thing, animal‘ has been omitted. It is also very
difficult to translate quickly enough.

The purpose of this grammar is to help any interested person learn to speak and understand Paya Kuna ,
which is spoken by the people of Paya, Pucuru, and Capetí in the Darién province of the Republic of Panama
and in the Kuna settlements of Arquía and Kudi on the Colombian side of the border. This volume deals with
some of the most basic characteristics of Kuna pronunciation and grammar, and it provides appendices on
various topics and a fairly extensive Paya Kuna vocabulary. Many important characteristics are not discussed
in this volume, but hopefully, after mastering these first twenty lessons the student will be equipped to
continue self-directed language learning. The grammar was designed primarily for use in a classroom where
the teacher is a native speaker of Kuna, but it also lends itself to learning Kuna in the informal situation of a
Paya Kuna village. Each section is not meant to be covered in a single class period, but normally consists of a
dialogue, pronunciation notes, notes on cultural etiquette, grammar aspects and exercises, and vocabulary
items for memorization. Emphasis is put on learning by mimicking in chorus and alone until the speech
patterns become automatic, thus, using a conversational approach to learning a language. An attempt is made
throughout to not only explain and drill the forms discussed, but also to enable language students to know in
which situational contexts their use is appropriate. An effort was also made to show the inseparability of the
Kuna language from its socio-cultural context.ixTHE PAYA KUNA ALPHABET
To simplify reference, Paya Kuna will be referred to as ―Kuna.‖ For pedagogical purposes some modifications
of the official Kuna alphabet have been employed in the spelling of Kuna words in the body of the text. In the
vocabulary in Volume 3, if the official spelling differs from the practical one adopted for this grammar, it is
given in square brackets.

1.1 Dialogue
When you first encounter a Kuna speaker, it is important to establish rapport. The first step is the use of
greetings and leave-takings appropriate to the occasion. One of the common formats for greeting and
leave-taking is given in this Dialogue.
Upon arrival:
1.
2.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"Appenxix N3194. if wrong, form a new hypothesis and check again
5. if correct, write up the rule
6. learn the rule
7. use and practice the construction
5. Gathering and processing information
There are several books which adequately deal with this subject and it is beyond my purpose here to deal
extensively with this subject. However, there are two cardinal rules worth repeating:
a. Write it down
When you gather information (language data), write it down. Otherwise, you (in common with humankind) will
forget it.
b. Filing
The information written down must be filed in such a way as you can readily ―find‖ it.
c. Rate
Don’t gather information faster than you can digest (process) it, or it will drown you. For example, don‘t sit
down and gather 100 new words. Just take 5–10 new words, write them down, check their meaning, learn them
and use them. Then, and only then, gather another 5–10 new words or one grammatical device and assimilate
that.","[331, 332]"
"Appenxix N3133) Passive listening
This is just listening to what is being said, without thinking about the intonation, grammatical construction
used, etc. This does not mean that you have ―switched off‖ the speaker. It means that you listen to the
speaker, like you listen to English, to hear what he is saying.
c. Noting the setting
This is as important as the tracking or listening itself. It‘s no use knowing patterns of intonation, grammar, etc.,
if you don‘t know when to use them. So, whenever you are listening, notice the following:
1. What incident triggered what the speaker is saying? Was it a question? Was it an allegation? Was it what
happened? Was it what the speaker had failed to do?
2. What is the speaker‘s emotional attitude? Is he happy, sad, angry, afraid or doubtful? Is he defensive,
aggressive, involved, neutral or trying to disassociate himself from something?
3. What is the relative status between the speaker and the listener? Is the speaker of higher or lower status? Is
the difference in status being ignored or even reversed?
4. Is the speaker using his authority or trying to manipulate someone? Is he only pleading?
5. Is he serious or speaking in jest?
d. Gestures
Note the accompanying gestures and facial expressions.
2. Expanding your knowledge of Kuna
It is helpful if you can use Kuna as soon as possible to further your knowledge of the language. In order to do
this, there are certain expressions that need to be memorized right away.
a. Language learning expressions

2. An wis itos, iche.
3. Anni turtabi, tule kakpal.
4. Anka tule kakabal chunma.
5. Anka tule kakbalbi chunma.
6. Melle anka wag kakbal chunma.","[325, 326]"
"3.4 Grammar
3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as
the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by
intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).
Example¿Pe mas tune?",[41]

6. mama
‗manioc‘
7. nana
‗mother‘
8. lele
‗shaman (uses black magic)‘
Note: The lenis consonant r does not occur at the beginning of words.
3.2.5 Pronunciation of monosyllabic words (Ex. 11)
Monosyllabic words are words which have only one syllable. Kuna words which are made up of only one vowel
and one consonant, or of only one vowel are pronounced by lengthening the vowel. When such monosyllabic
words are said in isolation or at the end of a sentence, the tone slides down (down glides).
Examples
1. ti
2. an
3. u‗water‘
‗branch‘
‗nest‘Exercise 11. Pronunciation of monosyllabic words
The teacher says a word from the list below, and the student repeats the word after the teacher, mimicking as
closely as possible the down glide in these monosyllabic words.
ExampleTeacher: ti

13. u
‗nest‘3.3 Culture
When people first meet, there is usually an exchange of questions which helps the people become acquainted.
Cultures differ as to the questions which may be politely asked in such a situation.
Questions about where you have come from and where you are going are quite acceptable in Kuna. The
question, ―When are you leaving?‖ is also often asked. That question does not have the same negative
connotation it does in English, but rather implies the idea of, ―How long are you staying?‖ Questions
concerning your parents, brothers and sisters, and wife/husband and children are bound to follow.","[39, 40]"
"310Language Learninga. Reason
This forces you to do several things:
1. Use what you know of the language.
2. Expand the areas of language that you need most.
3. Decrease the use of the national language, which helps you to start ―thinking‖ in Kuna.
4. Usage helps the words and patterns you employ to become more automatic.
b. Problem
Speaking only Kuna will increase cultural stress.137 It is important to note that cultural stress is different from
culture shock inasmuch as it affects everybody who lives in a culture other than their own. The frustration of
trying to communicate in a language you do not control increases your stress load. This is especially true in the
early days but will decrease as your ability to speak Kuna increases. In addition, moving around in a minefield
of unknown cultural booby traps in the form of gestures, attitudes and nuances of spoken clues, is also very
stressful. You should be aware of how to recognize and deal with this problem. There is much written on this
subject which would be of help. In light of this problem. the rule of ―speak Kuna and only Kuna‖ should be
modified.
For instance, depending upon your intended length of stay, stress tolerance, etc., ―only Kuna‖ might have to be
modified to ―only Kuna for X number of hours per day.‖ Preferably you should state when this should be, e.g.,
12:00 noon - 8:00 p.m. (the busy visiting time). It will take discipline even to do this, but the effort will be
worth it. Cultural relaxation, such as light reading or music is good after the end of the designated period for
speaking.
c. Setting the limit on speaking only Kuna
There are three ways in which you can limit (modify) the rule of ―speak only Kuna, always.‖ Again, you need
to remember that you are looking for the minimum number of exceptions to this rule that will allow you to
work and live within your limitations (of your stress load, etc.).
1) Time
You should set what portion of the day you will relax the rule of speaking Kuna only, e.g., after 8:00 p.m.
By this time most visitors are gone. If there are still some around, you don‘t have to force yourself to keep
speaking Kuna if you get ―stuck.‖
Relaxing the rule does not mean that you revert to Spanish completely, but means that you allow yourself
to indulge in using a Spanish sentence here or there, or to express a point you aren‘t yet able to do in
Kuna.
2) Geographic location
You may decide to make exceptions on the basis of physical location. For example, you may decide that if
you visit a Kuna, you will only speak Kuna. If he visits you, there may be times when you will allow him
to address you in Spanish.
3) Situation
You need to list the situations under which you will allow yourself to relax the rule of speaking only Kuna.
For example, a reasonable exception would be during an emergency—medical or otherwise. You need to
decide what your rules are going to be in the presence of a Kuna, plus a person who doesn‘t understand
only Kuna.","[322, 323]"
"Appenxix N311d. The necessity of setting a limit to the exceptions
You are human, and unless you set a limit to your ―exceptions,‖ you will find that you start to use the language
less and less. It is hard to speak Kuna all the time and experience the frustration of not being able to
communicate properly, but this ―forcing‖ of yourself to speak it will make you use what you know and ―dig‖
for what you don‘t know. Therefore, adhere rigidly to your limits!
2. Keep others talking
In learning Kuna, an important part of the process is ―listen, listen, listen.‖
a. Reason
This is useful in several ways:
1. Hearing the language in its natural context gives good reliable correlation between the situation and the
appropriate intonation, grammar and vocabulary.
2. You increase your ability to divide up a torrent of speech into meaningful pieces so that you understand
what is being said.
3. You increase your ability to visualize the situation under discussion without having to go through some
intermediate language.
4. Constantly hearing the intonation and grammatical patterns tends to reinforce them in your own mind.
5. Hearing a word used in different contexts helps define the area of meaning of a word, e.g., neg is found to
mean ―house or building.‖ It is also used to refer to the ―village‖ (as opposed to the surrounding
countryside) or a ―field.‖ It is also used as a ―place‖ in general.
b. Problem
The problem is that in Kuna, like most languages, you have to show your interest in what is being said by
responding in the appropriate way, or the person will feel that you aren‘t interested and stop talking. In Kuna,
this is done by so-called conversation sustainers such as mmmm, ajáj, or repeating the last important phrase
of what was being said. These conversation sustainers should be used right from the beginning, starting with the
more simple neutral ones such as mmmm and injecting them at random until you can distinguish the
appropriate places to use them.
3. Plan your contacts
We have probably all, at some time or another, experienced the embarrassment of being with somebody, either
in or outside of our own culture, when neither we nor they knew what to say. The memory of the heavy and
embarrassing silence tends to stay with one a long while.
The way to avoid this is to plan your contact with the other person. If the person comes to see you, run through
your prepared conversation and allow him to say what he wants to say. As soon as the conversation shows signs
of winding down, you should be ready with some planned activity such as looking at a magazine or photos with
him or having him watch you make something.
When you visit another person, have a conversation prepared, even if it is only two or three exchanges to start
with. Once you have said what you prepared and the conversation shows signs of slowing down, say goodbye
and leave right away. The people you visit might think your visit short, but that is better than the embarrassment
(to them) of a long silence.","[323, 324]"
"‗The girl sold the blouse herself (of her own volition).‘19.4.3 Futility
An event or action may be perceived as being done in vain. This concept of futility is expressed by the adverb
pinche ‗in vain/for nothing‘ which, in this usage, normally occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Examples
1. Pinche an ti.
‗I went for nothing.‘
2. Pinche an ul chobzha.
‗I might as well have not made the canoe.‘
However, when used as an adverb of futility, pinche occasionally occurs in the adverbial position.
Example
Antin pinche mani amidi.
‗I went in vain for the money.‘
Pinche can also mean ‗just (for no reason/purpose)‘. Intonation, context and word order provide clues to which
meaning it has.
19.4.3.1 Intonation clue
A disclaimer intonation (see 6.2.2) indicates ―just (without real purpose)‖ whereas a frustrated intonation
indicates the sense of ―in vain‖.
19.4.3.2 Contextual clue
If the speaker has indicated that some purpose gave rise to the action, the word pinche would have an ―in vain‖
connotation. If you surmise from the context that the action had no specific purpose, the connotation of pinche
is ―just (for no reason/purpose)‖.
19.4.3.3 Word order clue
When pinche occurs at the beginning of a sentence, it invariably means ―in vain‖.
19.4.4 Ability (Ex. 7–9)
Expressions which deal with a person‘s ability to carry out an action parallel the English expression, ―to be able
to....‖ In Kuna, various words are used to describe innate ability, capacity to perform, and an acquired skill.
19.4.4.1 Ability in the five senses (innate ability)
The five basic senses are described in Kuna by two verbs: tak ‗to see‘ (atak ‗to look at‘) and ito ‗to
hear/feel/taste/smell‘. The ability to use the senses is expressed by the use of the verb mag ‗to be able to‘ which
usually precedes the verb of sense.
Examples
1. Machi toto mag take.
‗The little boy is able to see.‘
2. Machi mag atak.
‗The boy is able to look at (things).‘
3. Punadin mag ito.
‗The girl can hear/feel/smell/taste.‘
Conversely, innate inability to use the senses is expressed by aku ‗to be unable to‘.
Examples
1. Punadin aku immal tak.
2. Machidin aku ito.",[272]
"‗I bought yeast, for Mother to make bread for me.‘14.4.6.2 Purpose clause - event precipitated by action of independent sentence
Another type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be precipitated by the action in the
independent sentence. This clause begins with meke ‗in order that‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added
to the verb.
The purpose clause marked by meke ‗in order to‘ focusses more attention on the purpose than on the main
action. It expresses the desired outcome or result (as yet unfulfilled) of the main action. It is part of the mainline
information and advances the story/explanation/argument another step in the logical progression.
The meke form of a purpose clause almost always occurs in the postpredicate position. Even though the subject
may be the same in both clauses, it must be stated in both clauses.",[193]
"‗If I cook (food), I‘ll cook rice.‘
‗If I eat (food), I‘ll eat iguana meat.‘
‗If you go to the jungle, I‘ll go with you.‘14.4.6 Purpose suffix -gal/-kal (Ex. 13–15)
The purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb stem of a purpose clause in order to express the purpose for
the action of the independent sentence. It may also be added to certain verbs to form a noun which serves as the
tool with which to perform the action of the verb.
There are three types of purpose clauses; a straightforward explanation of the purpose of the action in the main
clause, a reference to the event that it is hoped will be precipitated by the action in the main clause, and a
reference to the event which it is hoped will be prevented by the action in the main clause.
14.4.6.1 Purpose clause - explanation of action
One type of purpose clause is formed by adding the purposive suffix -gal/-kal to the verb (stem) of the
(purpose) clause. This type of purpose construction is used to give a straightforward explanation of the purpose
or desired goal of the action in the independent sentence. It parallels the English construction, ―He went
shopping to buy shoes.‖ In this construction, the focus is on the independent sentence. The speaker wishes to
express one main idea, but adds the purpose construction to give additional background information. Hence, the
purpose clause does not advance the listener to the next step in the story/explanation/argument, but rather gives
the motive for the main action.
Although a purpose clause may occur in the adverbial position in a sentence, it usually occurs at the end of a
sentence in the postpredicate position (see 17.4.1).

1. Machimal ya akinai, ti ariogal.",[193]

18.4.1 Nominalization (Ex. 4–5)
Verbs may be nominalized by the addition of the suffix -d.
Examples

b. kobed
2a. namake
b. namaked
3a. Sagla tulemal namaked wis.‗to drink‘
‗a drink/something to drink‘
‗to sing/chant‘
‗a song/chant/something sung or chanted‘
‗The chief knows the Kuna chants.‘18.4.1.1 Use of nominalized forms
A nominalized form of a verb may be used as a noun. The examples above parallel the English construction,
―something to (verb).‖ It may also be used to refer to a person/animal who is doing the verb which is used. This
parallels the English construction, ―the person/animal who is (verb)-ing.‖
Examples
1. kukualed onaned
‗pilot (lit.: the person who is causing the airplane to go)‘
2. arpamalad
‗workers (lit.: the people who are working)‘
3. immal taked
‗manager (lit.: the person who is watching (it))‘
4. achu neg taked
‗watch dog‘
A nominalized verb may also be used in a construction which parallels the English relative clause in the
sentence, ―The boy who cut his hand, is the one I saw.‖ In the Kuna phrase chunkal chiked ‗who cut his
hand‘, the nominalized form of the verb chik ‗to cut‘ is used as a relative clause.
Examples
1. Machi chiklejad nad.
2. Machi nono kochad arpanai.",[259]
"2.4 Grammar
2.4.1 Word order (Ex. 29–30)
Most languages allow for some variation in the normal word order for specific reasons. In Kuna, the normal
word order is different from Spanish or English. Normal word order in the transitive sentence is subject, object,
predicate.
Example
Subject
Object
An

In order to really learn something in Kuna, you have to go through five steps in the learning process.
1. Awareness
First, you need to be made aware of the existence of a particular sound, word, grammatical construction or
intonation pattern and its meaning. Yon have to learn to ―hear‖ (recognize) it in a particular context. For
example, you find out (become aware) that toa means ―who‖ and start to ―hear‖ (recognize) it when it is used in
an amplificatory question (see Section 4.4.3.1).
Example¿Toa nade?","[321, 322]"
"14.4.6.3 Purpose clause - event prevented by independent sentence action
This third type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be averted/prevented by the action
in the independent sentence. This clause begins with the adverb melle ‗don‘t‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal
is added to the verb. This parallels the English construction ―in order not to....‖
Example
Pe anka chogo, melle an igegal.",[194]
"‗The chief began to say to the boy,‘
‗―Go home!‖‘
‗―Fine!‖ the boy replied to him.‘
‗―Peter will go with me.‖‘14.4.11 Verbs of thinking
In Kuna, three different verbs are used which can be translated by the English verb, ―to think.‖ A difference is
made between an opinion held, the process of thinking (cogitating) and surmise.
14.4.11.1 Opinion
The position/opinion of the speaker on a particular topic/situation is stated by using the habitual aspect of ―to
think/say‖ followed by a direct or indirect quote, which is the stated position/opinion of the speaker.
ExampleAntin chog: ―Nabir.‖86‗I think that is fine.‘14.4.11.2 Process of thinking
The process of thinking is expressed by the verb pinzhe ‗to think (about)‘. The verb is preceded by the thought
which is marked by the specific or general suffix -gin/-kin or -bal/-pal (see 14.4.8.1–4).
ExampleAn nangin pinzheji.",[203]
"4 QUESTIONS
4.1 Dialogue
Question words are extremely useful in finding your way among strangers in a new place. When you have only
partial control of the language, you can question someone until you fully understand what they have been
saying. By fully using the question words—several of which are included in Dialogue 4.1—you can continue a
conversation for a reasonable time, even though you have very little control of the language. They also help the
language learner to become better acquainted with the language and culture.

"13.4 Grammar
13.4.1 Male/female distinction
Although gender is not marked in Kuna, if there is a need to indicate male or female, the word ome
‗woman/female‘ or the word machered ‗man/male‘ precedes the word to be modified. That is, gender is
indicated in the form of a possessive construction as in 13.4.2 below. People, animals, birds, fish, reptiles, and
certain plants that have separate male and female counterparts may be described in this way.
Examples
1. tule ome
2. kallin machered
3. chigli ome
4. kwarkwad ome‗woman‘
‗rooster‘
‗wild turkey hen‘
‗female papaya tree‘13.4.2 Possessives (Ex. 3–5)
The concept of possession in Kuna is expressed by using the name of the possessor or a pronoun which refers to
him, with or without a possessive suffix.
13.4.2.1 Pronoun of noun referring to the possessor without possessive suffix
When possession is expressed by the name of the possessor, the possessor or a pronoun without a possessive
suffix, the possessed item follows.
Examples
1. An achu neggin mai.
2. Pab achu neggin mai.
3. Pedro achu neggin mai.",[173]
"19.4 Grammar
19.4.1 Obligation (Ex. 5–6)
Obligation parallels the English construction, ―ought to ...‖ or ―have to ...‖. This concept is expressed by adding
the obligatory suffix -nab to the long form of the verb stem.
Example
Nuskan e pabgan atakenab.",[271]
"12.4 Grammar
12.4.1 Time-setting
Establishing the time or setting of an event is very important. Temporal expressions may relate an event to the
time the speaker is speaking. Such expressions serve the same purpose as the English time words ―yesterday‖
or ―tomorrow.‖ They may also relate the time of an event to another event. English examples of this type of
construction include the first clause, i.e., subordinate sentence, of a sentence which begins, ‗When...‘, for
example, ―When Judy came, Mary set the table.‖ Another example is, ―When the sun shines, I will go
swimming.‖
Time expressions (word/phrase/subordinate sentence) usually53 occur at the beginning of the sentence in Kuna.
12.4.1.1 Relating the event to the present (Ex. 4–11)
In this section, we deal with relating the time an event takes place with the present, the time that the speaker is
speaking, i.e., whether the time reference is past, present, or future.
53Time expressions occasionally occur after the subject or at the end of the sentence, as discussed in 12.4.1.a.3, both in b)
and c).",[155]
"134Conversation Continuance11.4.3.6 Confirmation questions used as conversation sustainers
Often a listener will echo a confirmation question back at the speaker. Confirmation questions are a useful
sustainer when the speaker is indulging in graphic descriptions. These are discussed in Section 4.4.3.3.
11.4.3.7 Echoing (repeating) used as conversation sustainers
Echoing or repeating the last phrase or an emphasized word or phrase is very common and is used extensively.
The listener repeats the emphasized phrase verbatim with a questioning intonation. Observe and copy the
intonation of this echo.
11.4.4 Holding the floor
There are times when a speaker has to stop speaking and pause to think, remember, or recollect, but he still
wants to continue to speak. As in other languages, Kuna has several words that signal this ―I want to hold the
floor‖ expression.
11.4.4.1 General holding-the-floor expressions1) Iwen
¿Iwen? ‗Who/What was it?‘ is used during a pause in conversation when you need to remember something,
but you plan to continue speaking. When you cannot remember who, what, where (iwengin or iwenbal), etc.,
you just say iwen and that indicates that you plan to continue speaking. If you say, ―Iwen ... iwen ... iwen
...‖, the listener is usually prompted to help you and give you the word or idea you have forgotten.","[146, 147]"
"‗Where?‘
‗When?‘
‗What?‘
‗Where could it (possibly) be?‘
‗When could it (possibly) happen?‘
‗What‘s wrong? (Lit.: What possibly?)‘20.4.11 Alternatives
The stating of alternatives in Kuna is complex: both of the alternatives are stated. Several ways are used to
express alternatives.
20.4.11.1 Alternatives in postpredicate position
A main sentence, either a statement or question, which gives rise to the alternatives is stated with the
probability/possibility suffix -dewa/-tewa attached to the verb. The two alternatives with the suffix
-dewa/-tewa ‗perhaps‘ attached to each one, are stated in the postpredicate position. When the alternative is
more remote the suffix -dowa/-towa is used.
Examples
1. Antin wichul inkwa tanidewa; pandewa
(o)128 achuldewa.
127‗I do not know when (he) is coming perhaps; perhaps
tomorrow (or) perhaps the day after tomorrow.‘The suffix -dibe/-tibe ‗perhaps‘ is used rarely in the Paya Kuna dialect although it is common in the San Blas dialect. It
is limited to already hypothetical situations. For example, ¿Ibi an immal kaotibeye? ‗How could I perhaps catch
something?‘ (see #13 of Section 20.1).
128
The Spanish o ‗or‘ has been borrowed into the language and is used often between alternatives.",[296]
"2) Eg
Eg ‗and/in addition to‘ is used in hesitating as you count money (see 7.4.1.3). It can also be used to
hold-the-floor, for example, when you say, ―In addition (eg) ...‖
11.4.5 Yielding-the-floor
There are times in the conversation when a change of speaker is permitted. By using a yielding-the-floor
expression, the speaker indicates it is now polite for someone else to speak. At other times, an interjection by
another speaker is an interruption. As in any other language, Kuna has ways of signalling the accepted times to
change speakers.
11.4.5.1 Yielding-the-floor questions
One of the most common signals and one which clearly signals that the floor is now free for another speaker, is
the use of a question.
One situation, however, in which a question does not indicate a yielding of the floor is the case of rhetorical
questions used for rebuke. The speaker does not want the listener to answer a rhetorical question. This type of
question is clearly marked by jaj which is added to the end of the question.
Example
Angry father to his son:
¿Pe es chapurbal ebes? ¿Jaj?",[147]
