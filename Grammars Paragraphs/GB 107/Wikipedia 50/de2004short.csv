The copular verb -ra is used in clauses that express attribution (3 .74), equation (3.75) and
possession (3.78, 3 .79). The verb -ra is a special verb with irregular forms which express
only person, number and gender. The verb c1iticizes to predicative adjectives (3.74) and
nouns (3.75), as follows:

be expected on the basis of the negative element in -eriaigo.",[55]

"1.4 Adaptation in borrowing and in code mixingAdaptation of Malay forms may take place in the context of borrowing, when Malay
elements become part of the I nanwatan language in a diachronic process on the level of the
language system, or in the context of interference, a synchronic process on the level of8Chapter 1language use, when bilingual Inanwatan people speak Malay with Inanwatan patterns
influencing the form of M alay elements. Because of the grand scale code mix ing and
borrowing the boundaries between Malay and I nanwatan are often unclear in the texts that
form the basis for the description of I nanwatan.
When adaptation occurs in borrowing, the adaptation is a imed at fully and smoothly
integrating the Malay element into the I nanwatan language and the adapted form conforms
to the rules of the I nanwatan language. For example sfkorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ) is good I nanwatan.
W hen adaptation occurs in the context of interference, the adapted forms remain part of
M alay and may be perceived as violating the patterns of (regional) Malay. For example,
duaberas in ( 1 .3) is 'bad' Malay and followed by a repair.
When Malay is the only language used in a communicative situation, for example in
church or when talking to non-Inanwatan people, adaptation is much more marked and much
less accepted than when Malay forms are adapted in code mixing, when speakers such as
Yunus in ( 1 .2) use both Malay and I nanwatan to construct their messages to other Inanwatan
bilinguals such as M urray in ( 1 .2).
The negative attitudes of the community towards adaptation of Malay forms in Malay­
only genres prevent most types of interferential adaptation in these situations. The adaptation
that I noticed is at h igher levels of grammar: the prosodic level a nd the levels
of discourse and surface syntax. For example, certain discursive strategies such as tail-head
linkage (see §4. 3 . 1 ) are used also in local Malay and the typical fall (tail)-rise plus slowing
down/pause phenomena (head) intonation contour of I nanwatan tail-head l inkage is clearly
audible in the M alay tail-head linkages. Lower level adaptations (phonotactic, morphological
and phonemic adaptations of the type kapa/>kQparo) hardly occur or are followed by repairs
in Malay-only genres.
M uysken (2000:3) distinguishes three types of code mixing: 'insertion of material from
one language into a structure from the other language, alternation between structures from
languages and congruent lexicalization of material from different lexical inventories into a
shared grammatical structure'. I n alternating I nanwatan-Malay code m i xing, levels of
interferential adaptation are comparable to the very low levels in Malay-only contexts.
Compare the Malay stretches in examples (l.2b) and ( l .2d) above such as hanya karena bu
dia sendiri disana m ungkin kekurangan kekurangan .","[20, 21]"

for Scientific Research (NWO) program The I rian Jaya Studies: a programme for
interdisciplinary research (ISIR) headed by Wim Stokhof and as part of the Spinoza (NWO)
research program Lexicon and Syntax headed by Pieter M uysken. The I SI R programme was
carried out in cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia ). Inanwatan was
chosen within the I SI R research program to represent the languages of the southern Bird's
Head, linguistically terra incognita. I collected data in I nanwatan in the first three months of
1 994 and during three months in 1 995.
Thanks are due to Dr Hasan Alwi (Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Jakarta)
and to Dr A.O. Atururi (then Bupati of the Sorong regency) for their support and interest in my
research and to Mr Dominggus Murray of Inanwatan for teaching me the Inanwatan language
and for recruiting many excellent informants like Titus Mamary, Bernard Mitogai, Agustinus
Yawae, Set Eramuri and Set Setoge all of whom I thank for their patience and kindness. I
should thank Bert Voorhoeve for giving me his unpublished notes on the Inanwatan language
based on work with an I nanwatan informant in Bintuni, Irian Jaya, in 1 9 82, and the Summer
Institute of Linguistics, at Abepura, for sending me copies of the survey reports of Gravelle
(1986), Berry and Berry ( 1 987) and Kempf (n.d.). Dianne van Oosterhout, who worked as an
anthropologist in I nanwatan for the I SI R project deserves thanks for sharing insights and data
with me. The Benawa word list found in the Appendix 3 was taken by her. She also supplied me
with a number of local Malay texts of the Inanwatan area. M arian Klamer and Ger Reesink
took the trouble to read the whole manuscript critically, and this led to numerous improvements
in the analysis and presentation of the Inanwatan data. Thanks!ixAbbreviations23

"3MorphologyThe relatively complex verb morphology of lnanwatan, where verbs can have up to five
affixes, is in contrast with the rather simple verb morphologies of the languages of the other
parts of the Bird ' s Head like Abun (Berry & Berry 1 999), Moi ( Menick 1 996, 2000),
M aybrat (Dol 1 999) and Hatam (Reesink 1 999). Verbs are i nflected for subject person,
number and gender, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect and negation. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes. l Gender is a pervasive feature of the
I nanwatan morphology, affecting all major wordclasses.","[39, 40]"
"3.3. 4 CompoundsI n noun compounds a modifying noun stem precedes a modified noun stem. When the
modifying noun stem is a feminine noun ending in 10/, the final vowel becomes lal in the
compound noun. The stress of the modified noun becomes the main stress of the compound.
The stress of the modifying noun becomes a secondary stress. Examples:

daughter of the sun3.4 Verbs
There are four classes of verbs, intransitive, transitive, ditransitive and copular verbs (-ra
and i-). Copular verbs have either their own, limited inflection (-ra) or no inflection (i-). The
other verb classes share inflection for person, number and gender of the subject, tense, aspect
and negation. Transitive and ditransitive verbs may mark the object in the verb, but only
when the object is the speaker or the addressee. Subject and object are crossreferenced or
expressed by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third person future
forms which have subject suffixes. A sizeable minority of verbs have suppletive plura l
stems, for example uwu- 'to sit', with plural stem te-, se- 'to go'with plural stem reqa-, miwi­
'to run' with plural stem noda-, qebadi- 'to turn (fNTR) with plural stem qebate-, na- 'to cry'
with plural stem neberu- and nou- 'to fall' with plural stem nouquge-.",[48]
"52Syntax(4.4)J-wasu53mai-wo-go.be-these here-CONN-CIRC
They are here.
When there is n o location expressed, the clause predicates the presence o r existence o f the
subject:
(4.5)J-wasu mesida-o ?be-these person-PL
Are there people?
Attributive-equative clauses (S P-ra) have non-verbal predicates expressing possession,
attribution and equation (see §3 .4.7 for examples). These clauses contain the copular verb
-ra, a special verb with irregular forms which express only person , number and gender (see
§3.4.7). The copular verb cliticizes to predicative adjectives and nouns. The predicate is the
only obligatory constituent in this clause type.
(4.6)Bada-o-wo!bad-F-be.3SG.F
It is bad !
I ntransitive clauses ( S V ) have intransitive verbs a s their heads, for example the verbs
tara- 'to shine', rawo- 'to come up' and i- 'to descend' in example (4.2). The verb is the onlyobligatory constituent in the intransitive clause, example (4. 1 )
A special subtype of intransitive clauses is based on experiential verbs, intransitive verbs
that take a bodypart as their first argument and express emotional and physical experiences.
Because the bodypart argument is always subject, the verb is always a third person form. The
verb and the bodypart NP are both obligatory constituents in the experiential intransitive
clause:
(4.7)Na-qer-eme-tutu-rita-bi.my-ear-M 3.s-hurt-DUR-3SG.M
I (male) have pain in my ear.

In the context of Papuan languages it not unexpected to have adverbial and relative
clauses expressed by the same form (e.g. Korowai, van Enk & de Vries 1 997: 1 1 4-1 1 5), and
also to have the same marker with topical noun phrases and adverbial/relative subordinate
clauses (e.g. Usan, Reesink. 1 987, Kombai, de Vries 1 993).","[71, 72]"
"3. 4. 8 Derivation and compounding of verbsAdjectives are productively verbalised by affixing verbal morphology to the masculine
form of the adjective. For example, sowate 'good' is the base for me-sowate-be 'she is good'
(3.S-good-PRES.F). This form may also mean 'she becomes good' and this is a difference with
the predicative adjectives supported by the copular verb -na that do not have the dynamic
reading (see §3.4.7, compare sowa t-o-wo 'she is/was/will be good'). Furthermore, the
verbalised adjectives express the full range of morphological categories (tense, mood, aspect.
gender, person, number) distinctions whereas the predicative adjectives with -na express only
person, number and gender.
I nanwatan has two productive strategies to combine verb roots (see §4.2 . 1 ). The first is to
combine verb roots in compound verbs. The second is to combine verb roots with inflected
verbs in complex phrasal verbs. Causative, (in)transitive and continuative verbs are formed
by both strategies. The first strategy is used to form compound verbs like uwu-ge- 'to cause
to sit', uwu-se- 'to sit continuously':
(3. 80)Qotoqowar-e btiakuko-qai m6-uwu-ge-be.child-M
bench-at
3.s-sit-do-PRES. 3SG.F
She (just) made her son sit on the bench.
(3.8 1 )N6-uwu-se-rita.",[56]
"1.3 Types of adaptation occurring in Malay elements(a) Phonemic and allophonic adaptation:lnanwatan has nasal phonemes with oral allophones. The Inanwatan phoneme Inl has
three allophones [n], [rl and [rl. The allophone [nl occurs word-initially and lr/r] word­
medially. The flapped vibrant [rl freely varies with (rl, the rolled vibrant, the latter being the
most frequent realization. Examples: ['ncr:>1 'name', ['a-rEr:>] 'your name', f'nira] 'day' ['nira­
rira] 'each day'. The Inanwatan phoneme Iml has three allophones [ml, [w] and (P]. The
allophone [m] occurs word-initially, [w] medially adjacent to back vowels (i.e. followed
and/or preceded by [0], [u] or [:>]) and [p] elsewhere. Examples: ['muwur::>] 'rivers'; ['napE]
'me (object)'.
Now in foreign words, word-medial [mJ may be pronounced as lw] or [PJ and the initial
[w] of source forms as [m]. Examples: Dutch e m m er 'bucket' is adapted to ('EPEf::>].
Indonesian wakil 'deputy' is adapted to ['makiriJ 'deputy headman (raja)', Indonesian kaca
m a ta 'glasses' is adapted to ['kaowato]; Indonesian limap u luh 'fifty' to Inanwatan
['nipapuru]. Dutch commissie, a term used for the Patipi headmen appointed by the Dutch
administration to rule Inanwatan, is adapted to ['bwisi]. Medial [n] is adapted to [r/r] in
foreign words. For example, the Patipi word inanwatan is adapted both to the word structure
prohibiting final C and CC clusters (>/iminowatanol, by vowel insertions) and to the
allophonic patterns of the Inanwatan language ([i'rar:>watar::>]. Malay II/ is replaced by
Inanwatan Inl with its oral allophones [ric], for example Malay wakil 'deputy' is adapted to
['makiri] 'deputy headman'.
(b) Phonotactic adaptationInanwatan phonotaxis does not allow CC clusters and final C. Vowel insertion and
consonant deletion are employed to adapt foreign words to Inanwatan phonotactics, for
example p6toroti 'pencil' is the adapted form of Dutch po/lood).
(c) A daptation in word stress and intonation contoursInanwatan has unpredictable, lexical word stress. Quite often the word stress of foreign
words changes in borrowed words, e.g. regional Malay pandita>Inanwatan paditae '(male)
minister'. When two Malay utterances are linked by recapitulative strategies reflecting
'Papuan ' tail-head linkages, the intonation contour is adapted towards the typical
fall-rise-pause pattern associated with 'Papuan' tail-head linkage. See §4.3. 1 for Inanwatan
recapitulative linkage strategies.
(d) Semantic adaptationMeanings of foreign words may change, for example Malay kapa/ means 'non-native
boat' in both its adapted form (kaparo) and non-adapted form. Because of the gender systemIntroduction7of I nanwatan, gender-neutral foreign nouns referring to animate entities develop gender­
specific meanings e.g. Malay pandfta 'minister' > Inanwatan paditae 'male minister'.
(e) Morphological adaptationMorphological adaptation can be illustrated with the integration of nouns and verbs in
the I nanwatan morphology.
Gender in I nanwatan nouns is marked by the last vowel, with nouns ending in a front
vowel (Ii!, lei) being masculine and the remaining nouns (ending in 101, lui and la/) feminine.
In a minority of nouns, gender has a semantic basis (male and female). Now borrowed nouns
denoting humans have lei or Iii added when they denote males and 101 when they denote
females, for example Malay guru 'teacher', has the I nanwatan forms gurui '(male) teacher',
guruo '(female) teacher'. I nanimate borrowed nouns are assigned a gender on the basis of
their final vowel, if they end in a vowel. When they end in a consonant, they are assigned a
gender by the addition of 101 or Ie, i!. Examples: ewero 'bucket' « Dutch emmer), kompasi
'compass' « Dutch kompas), kaparo 'ship' « Malay kapaL), potoroti 'penci l ' « Dutch
potlood), pensili « Malay pensil 'pencil'), listriki 'electricity' « M alay listrik), tabQqido
'tobacco' « Dutch tabak). The addition of vowels is done arbitrarily, that is, I have not (yet)
been able to find a semantic or phonetic base for the gender-integration of such non-human
nouns.
I nanwatan has a complex verb morphology. Verbs are inflected for subject person and
number, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect, negation and gender. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third
person future forms which have subject suffixes. To integrate foreign verbs into this system,
Malay verbs (like buka 'to open') are productively combined with the verb ge- 'to do' in
complex phrasal verbs (see §4.2. 1 ). Phonologically, the Malay verb and the verb ge- with its
prefixes and suffixes are integrated under one stress contour and the first 1m! of the subject
prefix Ime-I is always realised by the intervocalic allophone [ w ] . Thus buka-we-ge-re
(open-3.s-take-PAST) instead of buka me-ge-re. Another way to integrate Malay verbs found
in the text is to adapt a Malay stem phonologically and then attach affixes to it as in
me-susa-re 'they lamented, wailed' (from regional Malay bersusa 'to lament, to wail ').
These phonological and morphological adaptation processes have drastic effects on the
form of Malay items. In the speech of bilingual members of the I nanwatan community one
can find hundreds of pairs of words with a Malay item alongside its adapted l nanwatan
counterpart. Examples: sfkoraolsekolah 'school', ttiu-goltahun 'year' (in which -go is the
I nanwatan circumstantial postposition), keredidaolkerja 'work ', kapa rolkapal 'ship', fko­
likul 'to follow someone'. Many of these adapted forms have been around for a long time in
the community and have a stable, conventional form. Although adaptation occurs very
frequently not every Malay element occurs in two forms (adapted and non-adapted). Some
words, like sementara 'temporary' in (1.1), always seem to have the same non-adapted form,
even when they are integrated within I nanwatan morphology.","[19, 20]"
"4Chapter J1.2 Transcribing and analyzing speech in bilingual communitiesLinguists collecting a nd transcribing vernacular speech in bilingual communities of
I ndonesia will increasingly observe Malay elements in their transcribed texts. This creates
special difficulties for the field linguist, for example how to separate Malayicized vernacu lar
from M alay in the transcriptions. Consider the following examples from three texts recorded
in I nanwatan. Bold is used in this book for all M alay elements in the data, irrespective of
their status as borrowed elements or code mixes.

ratusThere are two types of Malay forms in such transcriptions of bilingual speech as in
(I. I }--( 1 .4), forms that conform to the patterns of regional Malay spoken i n the Bird's Head
such as sementara and Desember. And forms that violate those patterns such as duaberas in
(1.3) and sikorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ). I n ( 1 .4) the Malay word lima 'five' occurs i n adapted (niwa)
and non-adapted form (lim a ) within one utterance. Since the deviations from the regional
Malay standards follow from adaptations of these forms in the direction of the vernacular
language, in this case I nanwatan, I will cal1 forms such as duaberas, niwapuru, sikorao-wai
adapted forms and forms l ike duabelas, limapulu, sekola non-adapted forms. Of course,
regional Malay varieties are oral, non-standardized varieties with a lot of variation, not only
horizontal1y, from place to place, but also vertical ly because regional Malay i s a sociolect
continuum with basolects, mesolects and acrolects. I t is normal for texts in local Malay to
mix elements from basolects, mesolects and acrolects. So, the norms are rather flexible.
Nevertheless, forms l ike dua beras, niwapuru, sikorao-wa i are recognized by I nanwatan
speakers as 'bad' Malay when these forms occur in Malay-only genres such as sermons in
church.
'Pure' regional M alay (without code m ixing and without I nanwatan loans) is used i n
church, school and government contexts and as an interethnic lingua franca (see Appendix 2
Texts, Part C for a text in this local M alay). Relatively 'pure' I nanwatan (without code
mixing, but with some Malay loans) is used in certain genres of the oral tradition like the
tugarido genre (clan (gob6) owned heirloom stories, see for example Appendix 2, Texts, Part
A, texts 1 and 2). Continuous, intensive M a lay/lnanwatan mixing is used within the
community as the default means of communication, exemplified by texts 2 and 3 of Part B,
Appendix 2, Texts).
It is to be expected that the I nanwatan morphosyntax is not immune from influence from
the morphosyntax of Malay but since we do not have k nowledge of older stages in the
development of I nanwatan, such influence is hard to assess. For example, nowadays SVO
constituent order occurs in frequent variation with SOY order in I nanwatan clauses but we do
not know what the clause order was before contact with Malay. But it is clear that not only
lexical words but also complete classes of grammatical words or function words have been
borrowed from Malay, for example discourse conjunctions (like baru and j adi see §4.3 .2)
and numerals (see §3.7 and §4.4.4). The inclusive-exclusive distinction in first person plural
,6Chapter Jpronouns and verbs (see Chapter 3 ) very likely derives from contact with Austronesian
languages like Malay and Sekar since only non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea
bordering on Austronesian languages or in close contact with them have the inclusive­
exclusive opposition.","[16, 17, 18, 19]"

And he had hidden her wings.wingthaLF4. 1.2 Clause constituentsThere are two types of nom inal constituents in the I n anwatan clause, core nominals
(subject, object) and peripheral nominals. Core nominals are unmarked phrases, i.e. they do
not take postpositions, and are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes (see § 3 .4 . 1 ). Peripheral
nominals take postpositions and are not cross-referenced in the verb.
The core nominals subject and object are distinguished by order only (subject preceding
object). Only in personal pronouns is the opposition between subject and object expressed in
the form of the constituents (see §3 . 1 . 1 ).
Peripheral nominals (in all clause types) may occur clause-initially (when they express the
time, place or other type of frame for the clause), but a lso pre- or post verbally when they
qualify the event or state denoted by the predicate (for example manner peripherals).
NPs governed by -go denote time (4. 1 3 , 4. 1 5), place (4. 1 4), instrument (4. 1 5) and manner
(4 . 1 6). The postposition -go is restricted to inanimate NPs and has been glossed as CIRC
(circumstantial):

"3.3.2 Number
Plurality is marked by a suffix -0, which replaces the last vowel of the noun stem. This
means that for the majority of nouns (which have 101 as stem-final vowel) there is no formal
distinction between singular and plural forms. Some nouns, especially k inship nouns, have
suppletive plural forms (see § 1 .8.3):
3In Puragi (see Appendix 3, §2.S.2), the neigbouring language to the north and east of Inanwatan, the vowel
opposition which expresses the feminine/masculine opposition in human nouns (final /0/: female, final Ii/:
male), expresses size/quantity in inanimate nouns, e.g. amepuri 'wind', amepul'O 'strong wind'.",[46]
"1.5 Language death and ethnic identity in the Inanwatan communityThe I nanwatan people realize that their language is dying. This saddens older people but
most young people do not seem to care all that much. I nanwatan is a language they associate
with the past and a language they cannot use in cities l ike Sorong, Manokwari and Jayapura
where they would like to live, a language they cannot use in the work environments they
would like to be in. But the older people also accept the way things are going. These attitudes
to language death by generational erosion can be understood better if we realize the relatively
modest place the I nanwatan language has in the way the I nanwatan people construct their
ethnic identity.
An I nanwatan person derives his sense of identity primarily from the gob6 and Jawu he or
she was born in. The noun goM is used for bodies of water (sea; river; lake; tributary), for
localized descent groups (clans) living on ancestral lands surrounding those bodies of water
and finally for the ancestral lands themselves. A goM consists of (ideally) four Jam (Malay)
or Jaawu (adapted I nanwatan form) with each Jam descending from a different son of the
ancestor pair (van Oosterhout 2002:95- 10 1). The ancestral lands of the gob6 cannot be
sold; only rights to use the land can be sold, but the land itself is the inalienable possession of
the clan. Clan membership is defined in patrilineal terms. The land claims of the clan, the
origins of the clan, the places where the clan has lived, rights the clan has acquired through
warfare or alliances, all these crucial things are expressed in the oral tradition of the clan, the
stories of the clan. These stories are 'owned' by the clan and people who are not member of
the clan should not know them, certainly not in the sacred versions with the real names of the
ancestors, and are not allowed to tell them. A lso within the gob6 there are differences in
terms of access to the sacred stories and to the 'knowledge' embodied in them. The secrets
are only safe with a small group of elders, belonging to certain/am within the gob6. TheseIntroductionIIare considered to be sufficiently 'dry' and 'cooled ' to be able to deal with the heating powers
of 'knowledge' (van Oosterhout 2002 : 1 0 1 ).
Interestingly, in these clan owned stories, the ancestors sometimes do not speak I nanwatan
but Puragi, another South-Bird's Head family language, spoken in the area of the Upper
Metamani river; this area is seen as the area of origin of various groups of people who
nowadays speak various languages l ike I nanwatan and Kokoda. When I nanwatan people
visit the upper Metamani area, the use of the I nanwatan language is taboo (Dianne van
Oosterhout, pers. comm.). In I nanwatan oral stories, when ancestors sing magic chants,
often the words of those chants are Puragi (see for example Appendix 2, Part A, text 3,
no.5 ). When 1 asked people about this, some said that the ancestors spoke Puragi.
The fact that I nanwatan is not considered the language of the ancestors, at least not by all,
is significant to determine the place of the Inanwatan language in the identity of I nanwatan
people. And the oral tradition of the clan, containing its history and rights, is transmitted in
both the I nanwatan and the Malay language, and can be 'stolen' in both forms. The
'knowledge' embodied in the oral traditions is what counts and not the l inguistic form in
which this 'knowledge' is formulated (see van Oosterhout 2002 :99 for the I nanwatan
concept of 'knowledge' and its relation to clan owned stories and claims to ancestral lands).
It is clear that the I nanwatan language has a place in the I nanwatan ethnic identity but the
notion of gob6 (gob6 land, gob6 flesh and blood, gob6 knowledge) occupies a much more
central place in the way the I nanwatan define themselves than the I nanwatan language.
Notice that the I nanwatan have generic words and proper names for social groups like clans
(gob6) and subclans (jaa wu) but have no word or name for I nanwatan as an ethnolinguistic
group (van Oosterhout 2002: 1 75 ) nor for I nanwatan as a language. For speakers of
I nanwatan, l nanwatan is a place name used by outsiders to label what they see as a 'tribe',
suku or 'ethnolinguistic group'. When I nanwatan define themselves in other terms than those
of gob6 and jaawu they 'skip' the level of the 'ethnolinguistic group' and switch to the Malay
political-religious discourse (kitorang Kristen 'we are Christians', kitorang Papua 'we are
Papuans').
,1.6 The linguistic position of the Inanwatan languageAs far as links to Papuan languages are concerned, to the east and north of I nanwatan, the
Puragi language is spoken in the villages Saga, Puragi, Bedare and I sogo. Puragi belongs to
the South Bird's Head family to which Arandai also belongs (Voorhoeve 1 98 5 ). Yahadian,
of the Konda-Yahadian family, spoken in the villages Mugim and Yahadian, is the western
neighbour of the Inanwatan language. I n initial survey work, I found only 8% possible
lexical correspondences between Yahadian and I nanwatan ( 1 6 lexical correspondences in
202 items) whereas 1 found 25% lexical correspondences between I nanwatan and Puragi
(52 lex ical correspondences in 1 99 items). With Kokoda, also of the South Bird Head family
and spoken to the east of Puragi, I nanwatan has 4 1 lexical correspondences in 202 items
(20%).
Structurally, Inanwatan shows many correspondences with Puragi and Kokoda in
phonology and morphology whereas I nanwatan is strikingly different from Yahadian in these
regards. In Kokoda and Puragi , for example, a masculine-feminine gender distinction is a
pervasive feature of the morphosyntax affecting 3SG verb forms, adjectives, demonstratives
and nouns. Their gender systems resemble the Inanwatan system very closely, with back12Chapter 1vowels associated with the feminine gender and with plural ity and front vowels with the
masculine gender. Example ( I . 7) is from Kokoda, ( 1 .8) from Puragi, ( 1 .9) from lnanwatan
and ( 1 . 1 0) from Yahadian:

On the other hand, the Kokoda and Puragi verb paradigms in my survey data have only
suffixes and I found no subject and object prefixes as we find in Inanwatan. Further research
of these South Bird's Head languages is badly needed to establi sh their relationship to
Inanwatan.
Concerning lexical links with other Papuan language fami l ies, Voorhoeve ( 1 975 :443,
445) gives average cognation percentages of the I nanwatan fam i ly with other Papuan
language fam ilies: for example, 4.7% with the Central Bird's Head fam ily, 5.5% with the
North Bird's Head family, 8 . 1 % with the West Bird 's Head family, 7.5% with the Marind
and Asmat-Kamoro families, 7.7% with the Ok family, 5.5 with the Dani family, 7.2% with
the Awyu family, 9.5% with the Kolopom family and 4.3% with the Sentani family.
These percentages are all below 1 0% and point in all directions: to Bird's Head language
families, to typical Trans New Guinea language families l ike the A wyu and to aberrantIntroduction13language families of South I rian Jaya like the M arind. Explaining the lexical links with Bird's
Head languages as borrowings, V oorhoeve ( 1 975) classified I nanwatan as a Trans New
Guinea language.
At that time, very little structural i n formation on the Inanwatan family was available and
the Marind languages were, with some hesitation, considered as Tran s New Guinea
languages. The structural information on I nanwatan available to Voorhoeve ( 1 9 75), the
pronoun system, pointed into the direction of the Trans New Guinea Phylum. The I nanwatan
pronouns of first person have initial In!, those of second person an initial vowel and plural
forms have more fronted or higher vowels than those of singular forms. According to
Voorhoeve ( 1 975:444), such pronoun sets occur widespread in South West New Guinea and
the western h ighlands. As in other coastal areas of New Guinea with intensive contact with
Austronesian languages, lnanwatan distinguishes exclusive and inclusive first person plura l
pronouns.
The typology and relative complexity of the morphology of l nanwatan sets it clearly apart
from the simple verb morphologies of the other Bird's H ead languages (see Reesink, ed.
1 996, 2000, 2002). But the type of morphosyntax of I nanwatan is very different from the
typical Trans New Guinea morphosyntax of mainland Papuan language families as described
by McElhanon, Voorhoeve and W urm ( 1 97 5:299-322). I nanwatan has no clause chaining
with medial verbs, no serial verbs and no switch-reference. I nstead, Inanwatan coordinates
fully inflected verbs. I ts verb morphology also deviates strongly with its subject and object
prefixation. The presence of subject and object prefixes in the verb (s-o-v) is rare in Papuan
languages, it occurs in only three of the over sixty families of Papuan languages, namely
Marind family (Drabbe 1 955), Northern Halmahera family (van Baarda 1 89 1 ) and South
Bird's Head family. Gender pervades the I nanwatan language in ways unknown to Trans
New Guinea languages.
Summarizing, I nanwatan most probably is a member of the South Bird's Head family of
Papuan languages. I ts lex ical l inks point in all directions. Structurally, I nanwatan is different
from both Bird's Head languages and languages of the Trans New Guinea group.
1.7 Inanwatan and the Marind languagesWhen we compare the structural data on I nanwatan with what is k nown of the Marind
stock (Marind, Yaqai and Boazi fami lies, Drabbe 1 95 5 ), I nanwatan seems to fit the
typological picture of these Marind l anguages, both in broad outline and in details of its
morphology.
The M arind languages are spoken in the central south coast area of New Guinea. It has
been recognized for a long time that the Marind languages display a number of striking
characteristics, aberrant from the point of view of the Trans New Guinea grouping of
languages as McElhanon, Voorhoeve and Wurm ( 1 975) noticed. The M arind languages
combine the following characteristics:
( 1 . 1 I ) the typology of Marind languages:
(i)the verb has a subject prefix followed by an object prefix in a basic SOY clause;(ii)there are suppletive verb stems to indicate plurality of the subject (and
sometimes of the object);14Chapter 1(iii)there are (often elaborate) gender systems with concord phenomena and with
front vowels i ndicating masculine and back vowels indicating feminine
gender;(iv)there is coordination of fully inflected verbs instead of clause chaining with
medial verbs, and no or marginal presence of serial verbsConsider the fol lowing M arind data from Drabbe ( 1 955). Examples ( 1 . 1 2) and ( 1 . 1 3)
show the gender system, ( 1 . 1 4- 1 . 1 6) show subject and object prefixes and ( 1 . 1 7) shows
suppletive plural stems of verbs:

Possibly the -wa morpheme in the emphatic forms derives from the proximate demonstrative
element - wa, compare the frequent local Malay emphatic form saya ini literally 'I here'.

"1.1 Research framework and data collectionData for this book were collected in the framework of the Netherlands Organization for
Scientific Research program The I rian Jaya Studies: a program me for i nterdisciplinary
research (ISIR) and further analyzed as part of the Spinoza (NWO) research program
Lexicon and Syntax.
I nanwatan was chosen within the ISIR research program to represent the languages of the
southern Bird's Head. This whole area is linguistically unknown and a data oriented study of
at least one language was seen to be important for a general picture of Papuan languages.
I ndeed l nanwatan and other south Bird's Head languages that I surveyed turned out to be
typologically distinct in i nteresting ways from both the languages of the Bird's Head and
Trans New Guinea languages (see § I .6 and § I .7).
The relevance of the Inanwalan data for the Spinoza program of Pieter M uysken that
focuses on language contact, resides in the fact that most I nanwatan speakers constantly rely
on two languages, M alay and I nanwatan, to construct their messages. I ntense bilingualism i n
situations o f generational erosion creates specific field linguistic problems, i n the collection,
transcription and analysis of the data (see § 1 .2).
I recorded and transcribed word l ists and oral texts in I nanwatan in the first three months
of 1 994 and during three months in 1 995. Since I had only six months of exposure to the
language, I do not pretend to present more than a preliminary survey of some major patterns
of the language as they could be observed in the word lists and texts that I collected.
There is a c lear age and gender bias in the I nanwatan data since the majority of my
informants were older, male speakers. Male informants were easier to get and easier to work
with for cultural reasons. The age bias follows from the fact that only older people are fluent
speakers of the I nanwatan language and still use it as their first language in daily life. The
Inanwatan community was very supportive of my research and many people volunteered to
tell stories, take me along on trips and to their houses knowing that I was recording all that
was said during those visits and trips.
Although the description is mostly based on natural speech that I recorded and transcribed,
I also made use of data elicited in Malay. These data are marked by (el.) after the reference
number. I used direct elicitation only where I judged the chance for i nterference from the
Malay stimuli to be relatively small but still there is no doubt a Malay bias in these elicited
data.",[16]
"1 29I 30Appendix 31 The Kokoda languageThe dale of the survey was 1 8 September 1 995. The i nformants were Paulus Nagora,
born in Kasueri in 1 959, Sekolah Dasar (elementary school) in Kasueri, SMP (Junior H igh
School) in Fak-Fak; Dance Kao, born in Kasueri in 1 968, Sekolah Dasar in Kasueri . Tomas
Keramu, born 1 965 in Kasueri, with Sekolah Dasar education, Matius Nagora, born 1 954 in
Kasueri, Sekolah Dasar. All informants spent most of their l ives in Kasueri and speak the
language daily and fluently. They gave information on their language in I nanwatan, the main
village of the district which has a small Kokoda section. I worked for four hours with these
men who were on their way to Sorong.
Kokoda is the name which is used throughout the Inanwatan district for the language
spoken in de villages Kasueri (about 1 000 speakers), Migori (500 speakers), Siwatori (500),
Tarof (250), Negeri Besar (2000), Tambani (250), Udagaga ( l 000) and Nebes (number of
speakers unknown). There seem to be two dialects: the Kasueri dialect (Kasueri, M igori,
Siwatori) and the Nebes dialect (Tarof, Negeri Besar, Tambani, Udagaga, Nebes).
The Kokoda language is much more alive than the I nanwatan l anguage. Whereas
Indonesian is often used by the l nanwatan people when they are among themselves, Kokoda
speakers use I ndonesian only for contact with outsiders. The Kokoda are divided into
protestant and islam communities. The name Kokoda seems to mean 'flooded land'. Big
parts of the Kokoda area are flooded most of the year. The houses, built on stelts in the
water, are interconnected with a kind of bridges.","[142, 143]"

I n example ( 1 .6) the verb ge- 'to do' occurs five times. It occurs with the adapted nouns
keredidau 'work ' in ( 1 .6a), sikorao 'school' in ( 1 .6f) and prakteki 'practice' in ( 1 .6g), with
the unadapted Malay alternating code mix kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu in ( 1 .6e)
and with the Malay loan verb angka- 'to appoint' in (l.6b). The verb ge- can be used as an
alternation device, for example kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu d-ge-re in ( 1 . 6e) and
as an insertion device, for example prakteki re-ge-re in ( 1 .6g). When used as an insertion
device, ge- forms complex phrasal verbs with the preceding Malay words (see §4.2.1). Again
the boundary between insertional code m ixing with ge- and borrowing is very hard to draw.
Malay words may be borrowed without adaptation. For example the loan conjunctions
terus, jadi, baru, suda(h), a tau, tapi, dan have various discourse connective functions inInanwatan and are never adapted. But most borrowed elements from open lexical classes
undergo adaptations.
l nanwatan speakers call the process of code mixing Lompat, a Malay verb meaning 'to
jump' and they usually have no problems separating 'speaking Tnanwatan ' from 'speaking
M alay '. For example when asked about utterances as in (1.2d) they will say that Yunus4-de is an allomorph of the Past suffix -re occurring after stem-final Iii (see §3.4.2.1).",[22]
"2Chapter 1Duriankari speakers are regarded as I nanwatan people who in ancient times were carried off
to the Sele Strait area by a flood (see Texts, Part A, no.4» . When I visited the I nanwatan
speaking community of the village Seget, situated at the southern entrance to the Sele Strait,
in M arch ] 994, the I nanwatan people there claimed that the Duriankari language was no
longer used. Below we will discuss the possibility that Inanwatan is not an isolate but a
member of the South Bird's Head family. The language, village and district name I nanwatan
originates from a Patipi expression meaning 'sago only' or 'it is all sago' (ina n 'sago' and
sewatan 'one'). The immense sago swamps of the I nanwatan area inspired Patipi colonists to
call the area I nanwatan ('it is all sago'). Patipi is a village on the south coast of the Bomberai
peninsula, in the Onin area. I nanwatan people use the name Patipi also for the Austronesian
language of the Bomberai peninsula known as Sekar, a dialect of the Onin language, spoken
today in Kokas by about 600 persons. Some I nanwatan people called their language the
Iriirowata ro language when talking to me,3 an adaptation of the word I nanwatan to the
sound patterns of the l nanwatan language (see below) but n idiiibo 'our language (voice)' is
the normal way to refer to the language. The North-Moluccan Sultans of Tidore had their
' middle men' in the Onin area who established trade monopolies on the Bird's Head south
coast, especially where major rivers watered into the MacCluer Gulf and the Seram Sea.
These 'middle men ' had the M alay title raja 'king'. There were raja's in the villages
R umbati, Patipi, Ati-Ati and Fatagar and each raja had his own section of the Bird's Head
south coast where he had some influence through representatives who settled near river
m ouths (see Vink 1932:4 1 ). The raja of Patipi sent representatives to the Siganoi river
mouth where they engaged in slave trade with the Inanwatan people. To get slaves, the
I na nwatan raided the interior but also neigbouring coastal peoples like the Yahadian. I n
exchange for the slaves, they received cloths, iron tools and weapons and guns from the
Patipi 'middle men'. Although these raja 's of Patipi never established a regular government
in the Inanwatan area, the Patipi colonists in I nanwatan married local women and Patipi
words were borrowed by the I nanwatan language. To confirm the Patipi origin of the name
I nanwatan and to investigate lexical links between I nanwatan and Patipi, an Austronesian
language, I visited the Patipi speaking village Kokas in October 1 99 5 . Examples of
I nanwatan words with Patipi origin: nati raja (king)' (>Patipi na ti), noto 'cloth; sarong'
(>Patipi not), pasao 'rice' (>Patipi pasa), sosorao 'forked fishing spear' (>Patipi sosona).
Between the 1 6th and the end of the 19th century, Patipi (Onin, Sekar) had become an
i mportant lingua franca in the M acCluer Gulf area. Old I nanwatan people told me that the
first protestant evangelists in I nanwatan (from ] 908 on) used a mixture of Patipi and M alay
in their sermons. The senior Dutch civil servant F.H . Dumas writes in his Memorie van
Overgave (Memorandum of Conveyance) in ] 9 ] 1: 'De op Bira geplaatste ambtenaar E.A.
Tanasale is [ ... ] de Papoeataal van Onin, die ook daar verstaan wordt machtig. ' (The c ivil
servant E.A. Tanasale who has been placed in Bira knows the Papuan language of On in
which is also understood there.) With the arrival of the Dutch colonial administration in
I nanwatan in 1 908, the Patipi influence diminished, although the Dutch initially ruled the
I nanwatan area through appointed Patipi raja who were called raja -comm issie (kowisi in the
Inanwatan language).
The relationship with Onin and Patipi is strongly reflected in the oral tradition of the
l nanwatan people. For example, 1 recorded a story about Namora, the first raja of
'3Possibly reflecting my use of the Malay term bahasa Inanwatan.","[14, 15]"
"The words eise 'yes' and (qe)q[do 'no' can stand on their own 8 as complete utterances in
conversations but (qe)qfdo is also used as an interclausal conjunction in disjunctive questions,
for example:
(3.62)K6fido e-ri-sa
qeqfdo tero e-ri-sa ?
tea 2SG.S-drink-FUT
coffee 2SG.S-drink-FUT or
Do you want coffee or tea?",[53]
"4.2.2 Clausal arguments of verbsPerception and cognition verbs have finite object clauses immediately following the verbs.
There are no complementisers or any other formal markings of the complement nature of the
clause. An alternative analysis would be to view these clauses as asyndetically linked
coordinated clauses that are pragmatically interpreted as goals of the preceding perception
verbs.

The object clause merodare arasaugo in (4.37) has no complementiser or any other formal
indication of its syntactic function.
Another strategy to express clausal arguments is to use nominalizations (see §3.3.3). For
example:

gender systems of both languages, the back vowel front vowel opposition is used to indicate
feminine (back vowel: M arind: lui, I nanwatan 10/) and masculine (front vowel: Marind Ie, ii,
I nanwatan Ie, i/). I nanwatan has a phonotactic rule that words cannot end in a consonant,
compare:
( 1 .23)T nanwatan
Marindmesidae
anem'man'
'man'mesidao 'woman'
anum'woman 'The shared gender morphemes (Ii, el for masculine and lu, 01 for feminine) i n I nanwatan and
M arind are significant since these are rare outside the Marind stock: as we saw above, the
back and front vowel opposition is found in Ok languages in personal pronouns (e.g.
Ninggerum, Southern Kati), north of the Marind, one of their traditional headhunting areas
(Knauft 1 99 3 : 1 6 1 ). The Sepik and Torricelli groups also have gender systems but gender is
not indicated by vowel oppositions, with an occasional exception in personal pronouns such
as the I wam (Sepik) pronouns si 'he' and sa 'she' which have a vowel opposition between
front and mid vowels (Laycock & Z'Graggen 1 975:742).
I nanwatan is spoken in the western part of the New Guinea south coast whereas the
M arind languages are spoken in the central part of the New Guinea south coast area. I n
between, we mostly find Asmat-Kamoro languages and some Austronesian languages. For
future research, I would like to hypothesize the idea that Inanwatan is a western member of
the M arind stock. We would have to assume that I nanwatan became separated from the
other M arind languages by the arrival of Trans New Guinea groups such as the Asmat­
Kamoro, probably from the mountains, and Austronesian groups like the Patipi, probably
over sea. Admittedly, the average lexical correspondence percentage of 7 . 5 % between
Inanwatan and M arind is rather low. Wurrn ( 1 975) takes 1 2% as the boundary below which
inclusion in a stock of language families is not defendable. However, if we take structural
considerations into account, the similarity between I nanwatan and the M arind languages
could well be too great to be coincidental. Notice that the gender and subject/object cross­
referencing morphology of I nanwatan and Marind is very similar, both in the morphological
pattern and in the grammatical morphemes. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of the shared
gender morphology (front vowels=M , back vowels=F) and the verbal pattern (s-o-verb) is
rather high since both are rare in New Guinea. Foley ( 1 9 8 6 : 1 38 ), for example, states:
'Marind is the only Papuan language I know which consistently exhibits A-U- V.'","[28, 29]"

and kinship nouns where possessive prefixes were found for 1 SG, 1 PL and 2SG forms (27) but
personal pronouns in the other forms (28):

demonstratives, adjectives and verbs and the system works along the same lines. Again, front
vowels are associated with masculine and non-front vowels with feminine gender:
(29)Einogo?a/dau?a nasi-omo.house this.F/that.F good-F
This/that house is good.
(30)Rabfni dcii?anasi-to.that.M good-M
man
That man is good.
(3 1 )Rawodciu?anasi-omo.woman that.F good-F
That woman is attractive.
(32)Mo-(3a-mai.come-FUT-3SG.M
He will come.
(33)Mo-(3a-mao.come-FUT-3SG.F
She will come.
Whereas in Kokoda and I nanwatan gender has a semantic basis in animate nouns only (male
versus female referents), in Puragi (as in Tehit, Flassy 1 99 1 ) the vowel opposition front
versus non-front is used in animate nouns to distinguish male from female referents (30/3 1 )
and in (at least some) inanimate nouns to distinguish small from big referents, (34/35):1 42Appendix 3(34 )amepuri
amepurowind
strong wind(35)beqani
beqanostone
big stoneNouns distinguish number, with the plural expressed by lui replacing the stem final vowel
of the singular. A number of nouns have irregular plurals:

einu murohouse
many houses(37)raga
rago
rorogamale dog
female dog
dogs(38)rah[ni moq6nada
rawo moqanado
rabin u arweone man
one woman
many people2.5.3 VerbsPuragi verbs consist of a verb stem followed by a tense or mood marker and a personl
number(/gender) slot. The Past marker is -ra with - da after i-stems (cf. Kokoda and
I nanwatan cognate Past markers with their a llophones). Gender (M/F) is expressed in 3 SG
forms. The person-number markers of Past and Present are the same.

habitual-durative suffix - rita . These tenseless forms are used for events presented as
occurring habitually, repeatedly or prolongedly. I n stories, the forms with -rita often seem to
loose their aspectual meaning and seem to function as narrative forms (see for example
Appendix 2 , text A 2 , (2 1 » . The 3SG masculine forms have the gender suffix -bi. An
example habitual-durative paradigm of uwu -/te- 'to sit':

me-te-ritaThe habitual-durative suffix -rita may also be used in tensed verb forms, like Past forms.
I n that case the Past endings are used. Notice the contrasts between (3.5 1 ) and (3. 52):
(3 . 5 1 )Mo-uwu-rita -bi.3.s-sit-HAB-3SG.M
He is sitting.
(3.5 2)Mo-uwu-rita-i.3.s-sit-HAB-PAST.SG.M
He used to sit.
See also Appendix 2, Texts, for examples of tense less (Text A 2, (2) and (3» and tensed
forms (A 3 , (4» with -rita .","[50, 51]"
"30Chapter 3The bound forms occur only in the first and second person. When possession is not
expressed on inalienably possessed nouns, third person possessors are understood, that is
m iro means 'her belly' (3 . 1 4). I n other words, inalienable nouns have either a possessive
prefix (first and second person) or imply third person possessors.
(3. 1 3)No.-wirime-tutu-rita-bi.my-belly.M 3.S-hurt-DUR-M
My belly is hurting. (I (male) have pain in my belly).
(3. 1 4)Mirome-tutu-rita .belly.F 3.S-hurt-DUR
Her belly is hurting. (She has pain in her belly).
A lthough informants used the bound forms consistently with inalienable nouns in direct
elicitation, in the texts I found free possessive pronouns with k inship terms:

"3.7 Numerals
The I nanwatan count on hands and feet. Counting starts on the left little finger. The
numerals from I to 4 reveal a binary system (3=2+ I ; 4=2+2). The numerals 5 (one hand),
1 0 (both hands), and 20 (one body) are body-part based and combine with the numerals for
1 -4 and with each other to form additive numeral phrases.

by Malay numerals. The numerals occur after the noun and before the adjective:

A number of postpositional clitics express semantic relations of peripheral NPs to the
predicate (see §4. 1 .2). So far I have found -wai 'to(wards), -tewe 'from , woide 'from', -qai
'in, at', -wo 'in, at', -ra 'to, for', -(u)ru 'with' and -go, a general circumstantial postposition
occurring with time, instrument, manner and place nominals. Here I give just two examples.
See Chapter 4, Syntax, for more details.

-3.9 Conjunctions
The topic marker -qe(de) (or sometimes -qa) cliticizes to clauses and nouns. When it is a
clause clitic it functions as a subordinating conjunction with adverbial and relative clauses
(see §4.2.4):
