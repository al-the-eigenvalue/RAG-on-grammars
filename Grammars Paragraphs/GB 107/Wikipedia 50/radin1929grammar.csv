"§21. Direction and Instrumentality
Direction is expressed in verbs by a large number of prefixes (in,
on, at, down, up, near, etc.) and in the noun by suffixes. Instrumentality is quite important in both verb and noun. In the former it is
expressed by prefixes (with hand, foot, head, mouth, etc.), in the latter
by suffixes (with, for, by, from). The verb likewise occurs with many
nominal instrumental prefixes.
§22. Person
The personal and possessive pronouns have a singular and plural,
possibly a dual. The plural is simply the singular with plural suffix.
Subjective and objective forms are distinguished, the former changing
terminal vowel to -i; the latter being characterized by the stem. To
this there are in the personal series, three exceptions; the third singular
subjective tse (demonstrative in origin), the objective singular te-, and
the objective plural on. The third plural personal (oni, on) is an old
noun meaning people.
The possessive pronouns distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession by means of prefixes. The reflexive is formed by prefixing mai-.
§23. Syntactic Relations
Position plays a relatively small place in Wappo, most of the
syntactical relations being expressed by suffixes, prefixes, and particles
(post-positions). A subjective, objective, and vocative case occurs in
the noun. The relation of the subject of the verb to that of the verb1929]Badiin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language223of the preceding sentence is very clearly indicated in what is one of
the fundamental traits of the language. Coordination and subordination are expressed by the postpositive particles. The subject of a
subordinate clause, if pronominal, is generally in the objective case.
§§24-31. GRAMMATICAL PROCESSES§24. Enumeration of Processes
Grammatical processes are expressed by a fairly large number of
methods:
1. Prefixation and suffixation.
2. Changes in the phonetic character of the stem.
3. Complete stem differentiation.
4. Reduplication (exceedingly rare).
5. Change of position of accent.
6. Composition.
Syntactical relations are expressed by position, by prefixes, by
suffixes, and by particles.","[31, 32]"

regular pronoun for third plural with an irregular form on. for the objective case.

an infinitive or participial force to verbs.

"In the sixth position, that nearest the stem, we find only three prefixes, for one of which there is only a single example (nat'o'aki, he
arrived). The second, pu-, by sucking, is of limited use, and the third
pi-, near, diminutive activity, one of the most important and extensively used prefixes in Wappo. That pi-, an adverbial element, should
be treated differently from the others seems to imply that it had become
fused at an early time with so many verb-stems that, in spite of the fact
that it became a free prefix, i.e., could be used with any verb, the
position immediately near the stem asserted itself too strongly for it
to be removed to the fourth position occupied by the other adverbial
prefixes. Regarding the important question as to whether we can
always gauge the approximate relative age of a prefix from its proximity
to the stem, our answer must, on the whole, be negative, because it
seems clear, first, that true composita (noun+verb) may arise at any
time and the noun of such composita becomes grouped with sixth
position elements, or such a detached element as, for instance, cumight secondarily be felt as belonging to another group and transferred40University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[48, 49]"

This is regularly formed by the postposition of la'ki, which is
composed of la, not, and a suffix of unknown force which also appears
with kaki, cannot. la'ki has the same effect upon the preceding verbstem as the subordinating suffixes -tsel, -kwen and frequently causes
them to lose the vowel of their tense-aspect suffixes. This fact, taken
together with other indications, suggests that -ki is the general verbalizer.
la has been secondarily specialized into a suffix or postposition
with the meaning of ""without."" For examples cf. §93.
§108. ConnectivesWappo has a fairly large, number of connectives indicating rather
fine shades of relationship of the different parts of the sentence to each
other. The most important connectives are the demonstrative-possessives -te and me, the equivalents of Latin eius and suus. This same
function is expressed in Yuki proper by si and sa .49
The most important connectives are the following:
ma""a, and, then (does not begin a sentence); pa't-a, then (with correlative
force; begins many sentences); yo, Latin-que; tse, tse'o, tse'ti, tse'ma, tse'ta,
tse'ka, tsel, then (these all have different shades of meaning); -wen, subordinating;
tu, because.",[148]
"§94. Adverbial-Prepositional Suffixes
The following suffixes are in the main postpositions as well as suffixes.
41. -wela, toward.
tcu'ya-wela, toward house; no'ma-wela, toward house, village; mut'i-wela,
toward north; onhu'tsi-wela, up to their eyes; tso'la-wela, toward hollow; z'p-wela,
down there; sv'mu-wela, toward evening.42. -la, there; idiomatic. This is only used with adverbs and is a
true suffix.
ka'li-la, long after; wehuwe'li-la, that's enough; -we'-la, toward; ye'-la, in front;napawa'-14-pi, from each side; te""-la, little ways.

secondarily developed into a true suffix. The -o is a variant of -u, on.
le'l-wilo, against the rock; k-e'ye-wilo, against the boat; te'pe-wi'lu, on that.
47. -la, without. This is, of course, the negative adverb la, but it
is used as a true suffix.

"1929]Radin: A Graimmar of the Wappo Language5The genetic problem was thus brushed aside by these philologists
as irrelevant and, at best, not of interest. Unfortunately, as new and
more detailed data were obtained and apparent similarities increased,
it assumed an unexpected importance. And here it is, it seems to me,
that the protagonists of the multiple origin theory (expressed or unexpressed) have shown a surprising lack of progressive vision. One might
have expected that the leaders in so revolutionary an implied criticism
of prevalent methods in, comparative philology would have recognized
that a theory like that of multiple origin was of value only in so far as
it explained the facts better than any other. Instead of that, instead
of welcoming the possibility of a new synthesis, they have developed
a new series of highly problematical assumptions like the wholesale
borrowing of morphological traits and a vaguely defined type of acculturation. Now the whole significance of the method of the American
school has lain in its freedom from stereotyped dogmas and it seems
somewhat of a retrograde step for it to cling so tenaciously to an
unproved hypothesis and emphasize purely negative aspects of the
problem.
We indicated before that the American school has not quite realized
how iconoclastic its method really has been and that this ignorance
is to be ascribed to 'its lack of contact with the European philological
method. But this divorce has had other serious consequences. It has
prevented the results obtained from the study of the American languages from making their contribution to the possible solution of the
problems that have for many years puzzled Indo-European scholars,
the case system, the nature of conjugations, numerous syntactical
questions, etc. What is perhaps even more disastrous, the method of
presentation adopted, for instance, in the Handbook of American
Indian Languages, has, on the whole, in its reaction against the Latin
scheme of grammar and in its lack of concern with other types of
presentation, taken on such a form as to make it needlessly difficult.
In the following grammar I shall make an attempt to present the
facts of the Wappo language as I found them in the texts and from
questioning my informants. I shall at the same time bear in mind
continually that Wappo has had a history which is often fairly clearly
disclosed in numerous forms. That interpretations of this kind are
highly subjective I would be one of the first to admit. But the facts
are presented quite apart from any hypothesis and in such a way as
to allow others to form their own conclusions.
But more important is another question I have continually borne
in mind. To describe one more type of primitive language, now that6University of Califorvua Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[13, 14, 15]"

"[Vol. 27One of the most important features of the spoken language as
known today is its deviation in certain grammatical details and vocabulary from the language of the texts, at least from that in which all the
myths told by Tripo were couched. My interpreter always referred
to this as the ""high language"" and experienced occasionally some
difficulty in understanding a few of the forms. It is difficult to state
definitely exactly in what the difference lies. This much is clear, however, that in the question of verb irregularities the spoken and written
language are at one. Certain suffixes like the aspects -cele, -mEle, -sElE,
-kElE, the inferential (?) -k-, vowel mutation for subjunctive, etc., are
rarely used in the spoken language, or if used, only with the vaguest
of meanings. On the other hand a number of suffixes with subjunctive
force, rarely if ever encountered with this signification in the texts
(-lEk-, -te-, -ta-, -la-) are widely employed in the present-day conversational speech.
The grammar that follows is based largely on the texts of two individuals, Jim Tripo and Joe McCloud, both men over sixty who spoke
Wappo perfectly. The former, now deceased, had spent many years
of his life among the Eastern Pomo and spoke that language quite
fluently; the latter claimed at one time to have known Spanish better
than Wappo; and there is a possibility that the tales of Spanish origin
dictated by him have been influenced by Spanish idioms.
The texts have been published as ""Wappo Texts"" in volume 19
of this series, in 1924.
A11 the texts obtained were translated by McCloud. He is also
responsible for all the grammatical forms obtained in connection with
them.",[17]
"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language21§15. ClassiJication
As mentioned before verbs use no suffixes or prefixes to indicate
the character of the object, employing for this purpose, whenever they
wish to express it, either distinct stems or, rarely, ablauted forms.
The same holds true for the noun and pronoun except that very
recently, probably, a classification of nouns into human and nonhuman has developed, the former being indicated by k-a-, a variant
form of the word for man, k-eo. A suffix indicating female gender is
found with certain relationship terms.
§16. iAumber
Most verbs do not today, except in the imperative, indicate plurality.
Some do however, either by means of suffixes (-te-, -1-) or by irregular
formations. In the imperative there is a true plural and probably a
dual. There can be no question but that Wappo formerly expressed
plurality in the verb very generally and it is more than probable that
it distinguished between singular and plural subject and object.
All nouns without exception express plurality by the suffix -te,
relationship terms often taking a reduplicated -tE (-tete).
All pronouns express plurality but not by the same suffix as nouns.
The demonstratives indicate both plurality and duality.
A number of verbs, two adjectives, and the relative pronoun indicate plurality by complete change of stem.","[29, 30]"

thus almost completely lost and primitive idioms became merely new
sources for illustrating the results obtained in the realm of IndoEuropean linguistics.
In America a complete, or almost complete, diVorce from the work
of the great philologists of Europe produced precisely the opposite
result. The two cardinal dogmas of the Jung-Grammatiker, that
phonetic changes are unconscious and without exception and that
analogy plays a tremendous r6le in all languages, are either entirely
neglected or only incidentally treated. This freedom from the restraint
of the classical school of philologists is of the greatest importance and
significance. It enabled Kroeber in his study of Yokuts boldly and
bluntly to deny the first (and most fundamental) dogma of BrugmannLeskien that phonetic changes are without exception. He says:'
The rules for the change of the verb-stem do not apply at all to the noun.
The addition, to certain stems, of one and the same suffix to indicate both the
objective and plural has quite different effects on the stem-vowel according to
the significance of the suffix ... . The vocalic mutations in the language can
therefore not be regarded as due to a single complex system of harmony which is
always equally operative and differs in its results only through dissimilarity of
circumstances. It is evident that there exists a general tendency toward vocalic
harmony which takes form differently not only according to phonetic influences
but in accord with logical differences such as the grammatical categories and the
distinctions of the parts of speech. The Yokuts vocalic system thus is arbitrary
rather than phonetically automatic and appears to be influenced as much by impulses
to express linguistic forms as by purely physiological habits.2In another place he says of Yokuts:
In other words an abstract grammatical distinction entirely suspends and
again sets in operation (a) concrete and physical phonetic law.3Such a new outlook is not only healthy but necessary if progress is
to be made. I personally believe Kroeber is not right and that his
method of procedure-namely, to claim that we do not have to go
beyond what we actually have knowledge of (in this case one or two
dialects of Yokuts of one particular time)4-is, to my mind, not only
non-historical but needlessly iconoclastic.
This same spirit of detachment from entangling alliances with the
results of Indo-European linguistic researches is found in all the utterances of Boas. In one of his last statements he presents his conclusions
as follows:5

"1929]Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language135However as the objective personal pronominal forms are also used
as the possessive the foregoing usage has become merged in an idiomatic
construction which consists in employing the possessive forms in indirect
discourse and other subordinate sentences. In origin this is simply the
persistence of the use of the objective form as the subject of the verb
in subordinate clauses, mentioned above. The Yuki idiom of putting
the object of certain transitive verbs in the possessive is clearly identical.48 There, however, the possessive suffix appears with the pronoun,
which is not the case in Wappo.
The question of the relation of the Yukian pronominal system is
too large to enter upon here. It shows marked affinities with the
Hokan series in spite of considerable divergence of detail.
§101. Possessive PronounThe regular possessive pronoun is simply the objective series of
the personal pronoun with a few changes. It appears however in two
forms, one with and one without the possessive suffix -me, the first
used with relationship terms and body-part nouns to indicate inalienable possession and the second with all other nouns to indicate alienable
possession. The second series can however be employed with body-part
nouns when they specifically express separation from the body.
The main difference between the personal and the possessive series
is the use of the old form mesa for the third plural, and the dual ka,
ku with all the plural forms, although tse'kato is also found. The series
follows:

§89. The Nominal Stem
The nominal stem forms a much simpler unit than that of the verb.
Like the latter it consists of a stem with prefixes and suffixes. The
prefixes are, however, few in number. With the exception of the pronominal possessive there are only three very sparingly used formatives.
True suffixes are on the whole scarce, being either old formatives or
expressing case relations.
In addition to prefixation and suffixation the only processes used
extensively are a loose type of stem-composition, sporadic reduplication
(only with onomatopoeic words), and a few instances of stem-differentiation for singular and plural. Vocalic ablaut either basic or terminal
is absent, although a few nominal bases differ from related verbal ones
by vowel alternations. This appears, however, secondary and unimportant and is unconnected with the old fundamental vocalic mutation
of the verbal bases.
§§90-91. PREFIXATION§90. Introduction
Prefixation is apparently an old process in nouns and one that is
still exhibiting considerable strength. The noun-formatives ma-, ho-,
na- and the possessive prefixes me-, te-, -mesa, to which must be added
the vestigial hai-, hu-, and the reflexive mai-, are among the oldest in
the language, while k-a-, human, te- plural? -demonstrative, and onplural are certainly very recent additions. It seems today as if the
same tendency that has led te- demonstrative to develop into a prefix
is extending to other demonstratives (tse, he) and converting them into
prefixed articles. In one word this has already taken place, tse'hasi,
old man (literally, the old-one). The vigor of this drift is possibly
only one aspect of nominal stem-composition, a process that shows no
indication of abating.
ma-, ho-, na- are apparently old demonstratives, ma- non-existent
today, ho, a variant of he, and na- non-existent today but perhaps
identical with ne- in ne-wela, inside. All three are generally connected
with nominalized verb or neutral stems.","[129, 130]"

BYPAUL RADININTRODUCTIONThe languages of the American Indians have been studied for so
long from one definite viewpoint in America that a few words of
justification must preface any attempt, such as the following, that
deviates in many respects from the customary method. About the
merits of the approach of Boas, Goddard, Michelson, etc., no words
are necessary. To seek to describe a language in terms of its specific
structure with complete disregard, for the time being, of all historical
and genetic problems is a necessary preliminary condition for any
adequate linguistic study. No penetration into the genius of a language
is possible without it, and certainly one of the most justifiable criticisms
that can be leveled against the studies on primitive linguistics made by
many philologists and ethnologists is that they have neglected this
type of presentation and permitted themselves to be completely dominated by purely genetic problems. Quite a number of philologists
(when discussing primitive languages) have been content to accept as
completely adequate and as definitely proved that particular method
of approach which under the name of the ""Jung-Grammatiker"" has
dominated linguistic research in Indo-European and Semitic languages for almost two generations. We do not wish seriously to
criticize this method, but we must regard it as a somewhat unnecessarily non-critical attitude to assume that a method, developed in
connection with a group of special languages, has, of necessity, a universal validity. The leaders of the movement, Brugmann and Delbriick,
made no such claims. All the value that might have accrued to the
general study of linguistics from an unbiased consideration of such
* In
justice to the author it should be recorded that this monograph was
completed by him in June, 1922. It was submitted to the University Editorial
Committee for preliminary inspection in 1923, and on their advice abridged by
omission of an English-Wappo vocabulary and other passages, and further condensed through conversion of many tabular lists of examples into solid text paragraphs, in order to reduce cost of publication. This necessitated recopying; the
author lived abroad for a number of years; and it was not until 1928 that it was
possible, through the aid of the Committee on Research in Indian Languages,
Franz Boas chairman, to have a final typescript copy made and verified by the
author.-EDS.","[9, 10]"
"[Vol. 27The impression conveyed by most of the sketches in the Handbook of
American Indian Languages is that they are indeed regarded as such
ultimate classifications. Many of the inferences of Boas, Goddard,
etc., point in the same direction. In short, there is an absence of historical perspective. In the second place, the method suffers from a
failure to appreciate exactly how iconoclastic it really is and it fails in
this regard just because it has divorced itself from all relation to the
older method as applied to the investigation of Indo-European languages.
At first blush it is somewhat difficult to understand how a grouping
of grammatical categories found at a given time should be regarded as
representing a grouping that is supposed to be, in all fundamentals,
the original or quasi-original one for a given language. Tremendous
changes must certainly be conceded for a cultural phenomenon like
language. And this apparent attitude is all the more difficult to fathom
when we are told that ""our aim is to unravel the history of the growth
of human language and, if possible, to discover its underlying and
physiological causes.""6 In order to do so is it necessary to treat the
grammatical system of a language as though it had always been the
same, had never changed? Above all, to hold such a view is it essential
to regard those features, that a descriptive presentation has shown to
be the most specific, as precisely the traits that have exhibited the most
stability? Yet I do not believe that it is unfair to state that this is
exactly what these philologists have done.
It is quite apparent, however, that the basis of the method of the
authors of the Handbook of American Indian Languages (Sapir and
Thalbitzer excepted), rests on a foundation entirely different from the
customary one. We cannot here enter into the proofs of our.contention,
but it does seem abundantly clear that a definite hypothesis lies at
the bottom of the somewhat strange interpretation of the linguistic
facts of one specific period, namely, the theory of multiple origin of
the languages of America, this in turn being but an illustration of the
general proposition that linguistic categories are of multiple origin.
Viewed from this angle their whole attitude is intelligible. This hypothesis, is from the nature of the case, one with which the students of
Indo-European languages, dealing with idioms belonging to one common
stock, would have little concern. Their whole method (at least that
of the Jung-Grammatiker) is to show how diversification has developed
from original unity. Thus here too the American school is, in spirit,
fundamentally opposed to the students of the western European
tongues.
6 Boas, ibid., 369.",[13]
"§75. Formation of Aspect
Two types of aspect formation are found characterized respectively
by change of stem-vowel (terminal or basic) and consonantal ablaut,
or by special suffixes. True ablaut is no longer functional except in
one aspect, the responsive, in the passive voice, and in a few modes.
Its importance at one stage of the language clearly was very great.
The following aspects were expressed by this method.

"Now whether most of these conclusions are true or not it does
remain a fact that only the method inaugurated and developed by
Boas, that of studying a language in terms of its own special structure,
could possibly have allowed of so independent a stand toward the
results of modern philological research.
As I understand it the American school of philology has two supreme
virtues: first, it studies primitive languages apart from any philological
preconceptions and presents the grammatical facts descriptively, and
secondly, it constitutes something of a reaction against the excesses of
the Brugmann school. Looking at its method negatively, however, the
American school suffers from two cardinal defects. In the first place it
does not always (if ever) tell us whether or not the descriptive facts
of the given language it presents are to be considered as constituting,
to all intents and purposes, the original classification of categories,
the original types of processes, in fact, the original phonetic system.",[12]
"1929]Radin: A Gra'mmar of the Wappo Language3.... it may safely be stated from what we know [i.e., of a given language at
one stage of its history], that phonetic traits often belong to languages which are
morphologically entirely distinct .....
*. .. their [areas of definite types of morphological characterization-reduplication, incorporation, instrumental cases-distribution do not coincide.
word categories which appear in neighboring languages are sometimes
quite similar.
.... areas of distribution of phonetic phenomena, of morphological characteristics, and of groups based on similarities in vocabularies .... do not coincide.
.... phonetic influences [without other influences] do spread from one people
to another.
It is not so easy to understand the development of similar categories of words
in neighboring languages ... . Equally difficult to understand is the spread
of morphological traits from one language to another [e.g., second third person
in Kutenai and Algonkin].
.... it would be entirely unwarranted to claim that all similarities of phonetics, classification of concepts, or of morphology must be due to borrowing. On
the contrary, their distribution shows that they must be considered as due to
psychological causes such as the unavoidable necessity of classification of experience in speech, which can lead to a limited number of categories only, or the
physiological possibilities of articulation, that also limit the range of possible
sounds which are sufficiently distinct to the ear for clear understanding.
If these observations regarding the influence of acculturation upon language
should be correct, then the whole history of American languages must not be
treated on the assumption that all languages which show similarities must be
considered as branches of the same linguistic family ..... We should have to
reckon with the tendency of languages to absorb so many foreign traits, that we
can no longer speak of a single origin, and that it would be arbitrary whether we
associate a language with one or the other of the contributing stocks.
[In proving relationship of certain languages] The question would remain
to be answered, why there should be such fundamental dissimilarities between by
far the larger number of words [he is speaking of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Haida],
and the question should still be asked how these dissimilarities are to be explained.","[11, 12]"
"§13. Predicating Concepts
Wappo, and Yukian in general, is built up around the verb. In form
it is both monosyllabic and polysyllabic. The monosyllabic stem
appears as v+c (rare), c+v, and c+v+c. The last two are fairly
common. The polysyllabic stem is either v+c+v+c (rare) or c+v
+c+v and c+v+c+v+c. The second is probably the prevailing type
in the language, the c+v+c+v+c type although not rare being clearly
secondary in origin.
The stem consists essentially of two elements, the base and a
formative suffix. Many verbs, however, also appear with a prefix1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language19forming so integral a part of it that it seems best to think of two stems,
:(a) base+formative element and (b) prefix+base+formative element.
As seen today the base or root is rather colorless, the formative element
fixing it, so to speak, in aspect, voice, mode, and time and the suffixes
and prefixes elucidating it more definitely in direction and position.
The grammatical and semantic discussions that follow will, however,
make it fairly evident that this colorlessness of the base is not original
and that it had a much more concrete significance at one time. In
this earlier stage the base, which probably had no formative elements
in the sense in which they exist today, expressed shape, number of
subject and object, and aspect. It has preserved the first in a fair
number of verbs, the second vestigially, and has transferred the function of the last to a large number of prefixes and suffixes.
Today the typical stem consists of a prefix implying indefinite
subject or object; the base; the formative, and a suffix indicating some
kind of aspect. Almost as frequent, however, is the type consisting of
pronominal prefix indicating the relation of the subject of the verb to
that of the preceding sentence, plus adverbial or instrumental prefix,
plus stem, etc.
At no time apparently, now or previously, have suffixes been used
to indicate shape and position in the manner of Siouan. Plurality and
distribution, however, were and still are so indicated.
The lack of concrete significance of the base, a trait that must,
in spite of its probable secondary origin, be regarded as extremely
old, has resulted in converting the verb into a kind of neutral stem.
It even may be claimed that the verb-stem is formed by the addition
of certain verb-formatives to a neutral base, even if historically we
shall have to admit that the neutral stem merely represents a degenerate verb-base. Only such an interpretation can explain why today
everything can be verbalized: adjective, noun, adverb, etc. It is
likewise probably only this colorlessness that has enabled the verb-stem
to fall so easily a prey to the general process of nominalization to which
it is now being subjected. That neutral stems once existed however
it would be unnecessarily pedantic to deny. There are, in fact, a number
of nouns and verbs where it is well-nigh impossible to tell whether the
predicating or denominating concept is more original:
pe, foot; poi, kick; pe-k, to track; -tv-, water and all activities of water; o'kEl,word; oka'li, talk; hucb'lak, hole, omo-ci'li, make holes.
Are these verbalized nouns or nominalized verbs? poi can conceivably be translated as intensively-footing-it and pek, footing-it; but
oka'li, wording-it and omoci'li, holding-it is not very likely, and if20University of California Publications in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.","[27, 28, 29]"
"[Vol. 27justifiably be regarded as sentences. However, the analysis of a word
occasionally indicates that such a crystallization has occurred, e.g.,
the verb, to drizzle, na-pi-t'u-hu-si, means literally, it-causes-the-water(plural)-to-have-a-diminutive-repetitive-activity. Indeed there is
much in Wappo to suggest the former prevalence of word-sentences.
Today they exist merely as petrified and distinctive words.
§26. Changes in the Phonetic Character of the Stem
The changes in the phonetic character of the verbal stem are of
five distinct types:
1. Modification of initial consonant.
2. Modification of stem vowel.
3. Modification of terminal vowel of disyllabic stem.
4. Apocope of terminal vowel of disyllabic stems.
5. Accretion of consonant.
For the first two the evidence is derived almost entirely from the
dictionary. In other words it is not a process functional today. It
is of so clear-cut a nature, however, and so important, that it must be
mentioned here. The consonant mutation (ablaut) is of two kinds,
either from unglottalized to glottalized stop or affricative, for example,
or from one to another of the same or of a related sound series, i.e.,
either from tc>ts or c>tc. The vowel mutation (ablaut) consists
either in a simple change (a>i, i>a>e, etc.) or in diphthongization.
Not infrequently vocalic and consonantal ablaut occur together. It is
important to remember that not only did the vowel of a monosyllabic
stem of the type c+v become ablauted but, very frequently also, that
of a disyllabic stem (c+v+c+v). In the latter case the terminal
vowel often retains its proper value.
The changes in the nature of the terminal vowel of disyllabic stems
are in part old, in part secondary. The secondary are due to purely
phonetic causes. The others are intimately bound up with the expression of voice, mode, and less consistently, tense, aspect, and plurality.
Apart from the expression of the subjunctive and plurality, each mode,
aspect, etc., has a definite vowel associated with it, i.e., the passive
always has -u-, the hortatory -a-, the imperative singular generally -e,
and the indefinite generally -i. We may consequently assume that we
are here, in reality, dealing with true formatives. This is quite true,
yet it is well to remember, at the same time, that formatives are, in
origin, simply mutated vowels, secondarily and possibly recently petrified and reinterpreted.",[33]
"§68. Formation of the Future
There are two futures in Wappo, a simple and a periphrastic,
respectively -si and -yaomi. Every verb in the lan'guage can practically use both forms although a few occur with -yaomi only. This
latter is clearly composed of three elements -ya- (old verb ""to go""),
-o- probably an old formative possibly related to petrified suffix -wv
(cf. §35), and -mi indefinite tense. It is, in other words, the indefinite
form of *ya, to go, and means he-is-to-go. Both -si and -yaomi are
unknown to Yuki proper, the futures in that language being- -pa and.",[109]

"[Vol. 27§28. Complete Stem-Differentiation
It is quite erroneous, I believe, to dismiss complete stem-differentiation to the limbo of the vocabulary. It is far better to regard it as
a distinct process. In a language where the initial consonant, the basic
stem vowel, and the terminal stem vowel can be altered, what appears
to be complete stem-differentiation might, very well, have not been
that in origin. However there can be little doubt that in the vast
majority of cases, where different stems are found for singular and
plural, for round and for long objects, etc., these are all quite unrelated
and due to idiomatic crystallizations, etc. In Wappo the distinction
between singular and plural is expressed by completely unrelated stems
not only for verbs, but for a few adjectives and occasionally for the
relative pronoun. The classification of activities in relation to round,
long, and short objects, to singular and plural, etc., is largely accomplished by the same means.",[35]

because it seems to appear only in the first person and to be used

comparative degree and some verbs used reflexively. In the past it is
employed quite regularly with all verbs (-sta). It is also clearly felt
in the -s- of -sa causatives which are, like -sta, not restricted to any
persons or verbs. All indications appear consequently to point to -si
as the first person singular of a causative conjugation, used with
adjectives and intransitive verbs. Cf. §75, ld.

"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language7PART I. GRAMMAR
§1. HABITAT AND STATUS OF WAPPOWappo, one of the languages of the Yukian stock of which the
other members are Yuki proper, Coast Yuki, and Huchnom, is spoken
today by a mere handful of people. Indeed it is doubtful whether,
when the material for this grammar was obtained (1917), there were
more than twenty individuals who spoke it correctly and certainly
only one, Jim Tripo, now deceased, who had any extensive knowledge
of the old mythology. According to some informants Wappo was
spoken in a number of sub-dialects but these seem to have varied
only in details of vocabulary.
Practically all the Wappo are supposed to live at Alexander Valley,
Sonoma county, California, a few miles distant from Healdsburg,
although as a matter of fact only a few families live there, the majority
spending most of their time in the various settlements near Healdsburg
and Cloverdale.
The Wappo, at one time, occupied two small and entirely disconnected areas, both of them quite separated from their kindred, the
Yuki. The first one lay in Napa and Sonoma counties and the other,
much smaller, at the southern end of Lake county.7
The first or main Wappo area is surrounded by that of the Southern
Pomo, Northern Miwok, and Southern Wintun (Patwin), the second
by the Southeastern and Eastern Pomo. Yet in spite of this contiguity
practically no specific linguistic borrowing has taken place between
the Wappo and their neighbors, the resemblances that exist being of
such a kind as to point not to secondary borrowing but to old genetic
relationship.
The language as spoken today contains only a handful of Spanish
words in spite of the strong missionary influence to which it was subjected. In several tales of Spanish origin, which in addition are probably
translations from that language into Wappo, a number of loan-words
were encountered. In the other myths and texts transcribed, none
were found.

"[Vol. 27a's-a is the indefinite of the stem, to give. The preterit is a's ta.
One might therefore have assumed a stem as* or a's-a. The future and
imperative however give us a's-i-si and a's*i'; a's*i unquestionably is
the true stem.
e'lice is the indefinite of the stem, to dig a hole, the future and
past being e'l-tesi and e'l*teki. Here obviously e'li- of the indefinite is
the stem. Our difficulties however begin as soon as we realize that -i
is associated with the indefinite and the durative mode-aspect and that
in another form of this verb o-e'li (to dig) we have a future in o-e'le-si
and an imperative in o-e'le'. Now as a rule the form of the unincremented future-imperative is closer to the original verb-stem than the
indefinite and we might perhaps postulate *ele as original or still better
*el. However in a clearly related stem o-i'se-mi (dig for water), which
can be analyzed into o- prefix, -i- verb stem, -s- durative suffix, -e either
inorganic or reduced vowel of suffix, we have the stem appearing as *i.
Now all these changes, puzzling as they are at first, become intelligible
as soon as we realize that the stem vowel of a verb is not infrequently
changed to express different kinds of aspects and modes. Our quest
for the original stem has clearly proved futile.
Let me give one more example: o't*i-se is the indefinite of the intransitive verb, to drown. The future and past are a't*a-si, o't-a-ki.
The stem ought to be *at-a, because we know that -se the indefinitedurative suffix can cause the change of original -a to durative -i. However the transitive form is at*i-a'te-ki, -a being an old causative increment and -te- the frequentative increment. The stem itself is an old
root for water and appears in numerous forms (ta, ti, ta, tu). In our
particular case it is quite impossible to determine whether *ati or *ata
is the stem. The chances are that it is *ati because a number of futures
have taken the hortatory base characterized by the vowel -a- when the
indefinite ended in -i-se to prevent the confusion of the two forms;
secondly, only transitive-active verbs, in the main, use the -a base;
and lastly, the causative increment -a is an old formation of the language and is likely to have preserved the older form of the stem.
The way out of our difficulty would be to regard all terminal vowels
of disyllabic stems as true morphological elements. From one point
of view this is correct. Wappo today certainly gives the impression
of connecting terminal vowels with mode, voice, and aspect, and this
has probably led, as much as any other- cause, to a generalization of
-i for indefinite, -e for imperative, -u for passive. Historically, on the
other hand, we must postulate the disyllabic stem formation (c+v
+c+v) as representing a fairly old phase of the language.",[79]
"1929]Badin:. A Grammar of the Wappo La#guage61Whatever may have been their original form, today the verb-stems
appear normally with a detachable prefix and one or more detachable
suffixes. Furthermore the terminal vowel of the c+v+c+v type is
often felt as a formative charged with aspect, modal, and voice significance. Deprived of its prefixes, formatives, and suffixes, the base
contains frequently no very concrete meaning, although essentially
predicating in connotation.
For various reasons discussed repeatedly, of a phonetic and morphological nature, the bases of the various tenses differ materially from
each other and this has necessitated an artificial grouping of verbs
into what we have called stem-formations. In addition we find the
indefinite tense-aspect formed in a number of different ways, some of
which are more or less definitely associated with certain types of future,
past, and imperative. For the sake of bringing clarity here, even
though it is fictitious, a grouping into classes has been devised based
on the method of forming the indefinite.
Our treatment of the verb then will consist of the following sections:
1. Verb bases.
2. Tense-aspect roots (briefly tabulating the variability of the roots
of some verbs).
3. Types of stem-formation.
4. Classes.
5. Formation of tenses, modes, voices, and aspects.
6. Absolute forms (participle, infinitive).
§46. Verb Ba8es
The vast majority of verb bases, and all tense-aspect and modal
suffixes (the imperative occasionally excepted), end in vowels. This is
not true of Yuki proper where we find at least half the verbs terminating
in consonants. That Wappo represents the primary condition we have
given evidence to show in another connection. However, the comparative ease with which so many terminal vowels disappeared in Yuki
and the frequency with which they disappear in certain tense-aspects
in Wappo, suggests that in addition to phonetic causes these vowels
had, in the minds of the speakers, acquired a specific force permitting
such loss. What this force was is not always clear, but in the main it
seems to have been connected with the expression of mode, voice, and
aspect. We may, I think, without running any great danger of being
wrong, definitely claim that whatever the phonetic causes were that
resulted in the development of the present terminal ablaut series,
today we have in Wappo a definite vowel -i associated with intransitive,62Univer8ity of Caifornia Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[69, 70, 71]"
"[Vol. 27The second position elements need not detain us. They are strictly
speaking proclitics whose fusion with the verb is being accelerated by
the force of first position te-, me-, mai'-.
The third and fourth position elements are all adverbial, unrelated
to any stems existing in Wappo today and clearly among the oldest
prefixes in the language. It is with these that the composite verb unit
can be said to begin, for the first and second position elements give the
impression of being partially proclitic. ttemewilts'awil, she fondled him,
has the feeling of temewil ts'awil, a possessed noun followed by a verb.
This seemingly proclitic force of the first position elements when preceding the second position elements is however quite secondary. From
the nature of the case the local prefixes in third and fourth position
only occurred with verb-stems and they thus resisted any secondary
disintegrating tendency. They were protected, we may hazard to
believe, from developing secondarily into nominal suffixes by their
position after the possessive pronominal elements. It is true that they
precede the instrumentals (me-, 'pe, na-, wi-) but these latter are only
vaguely regarded as nouns and are so intimately associated with the
verb activity that a separation from the verb-stem proper and a grouping
with the third and fourth position elements would be felt as quite
preposterous. For instance, oniapiwa'tasi, he-stamped-with-the-foot,
could never split up into omapi and watasi.
Two of the fifth position elements are non-instrumental, cu- and
hu-, and require some explanation. The verbs with these prefixes can
best be interpreted as old composita whose prefixed element is beginning
to be felt as adverbial and as detachable. This is at least the case for
cu- and explains why it is separated from the stem when pi- (near),
na- (idiomatic), and pv- (by sucking) are used. In other words as soon
as cu- was felt as an adverb it took the position occupied by adverbial
prefixes in the composite verb. hu- apparently has not yet reached
that stage.
In the fifth position, with two exceptions, we have only instrumentals. They are all slight variants of nouns still extensively used. Their
instrumental function is quite clear and they are rarely treated as noun
subjects or objects. In origin they must certainly have been of the
type still largely exemplified by hu-, but their transformation into
instrumentals belongs to an old period of the language.
1. cu-, to follow, after, back, off.
This prefix seems an excellent example both of an old compound
and of a verb-base in the process of decay. We meet it as an independent' verb-stem, as a semi-independent adverb, and as a true ad-1929]'Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language31verbial prefix. Its function as a prefix is probably quite recent for it is
found only with certain verbs. But as an incorporated verb it is quite
old. It is however fairly rapidly coming into more extensive use as
an adverbial prefix and seems, at the same time, to be developing into
a nominal suffix.

Active intransitive, intransitive-impersonal, durative responsiveby ablaut of terminal stem vowel.
It is rather significant to note that of all these activities only one
is specifically expressed today, the durative, and this by a suffix.
The second method, suffixation, is still extensively used. Of the
aspects found indicated by this method the most important are the
causative, continuative, iterative, durative, usitative, and progressive.
Formation of causative.-The causative is expressed in five distinct
ways: by the suffixes -a or -ha, -sa, -tasa (-tasi, -ttsta) -mesi (mesta) and
a special conjugation (-si first person singular; -ti second person singular,
and -mi in the other persons). Of these -a (-ha) is no longer functional.
There are thus three distinct elements involved here -a, -sv- and -mesi,
all of which are probably old verb stems although only for -mesi can
this be definitely proved. Yuki has -si, -s but not the others. Yuki
possesses likewise a causative -ttl and this suggests that the -ta- in
Wappo -tasv- is also to be regarded as a distinct causative element.
In that case -tasv- can best be analyzed into -ta- causative and -susitative and should be kept apart from -te- iterative and -ta- sub-junctive.
One is tempted to analyze -mesi into -me verbal stem ""to do"" and
usitative -s- but there is not sufficient evidence for this.

changes that characterized all but some of the increment forms have
been levelled down. The original, unchanged, and unincremented
form, which apparently expressed single momentaneous activity, has
lost that force and acquired an indefinite significance. The increment
bases, especially those in -te-, 1-, -mak-, -lek-, have become restricted
to the future and past tenses.
A few irregularly distributed survivals of some of the intensive
and diminutive forms occur, giving rise to peculiar forms for the passive,
for the reflexive, for the transitive and intransitive, and even for
certain tenses and modes.
§§48-50. VERBAL TENSE-ASPECT ROOTS§48. Wappo Verb Base from a Phonetic Viewpoint
The Wappo verb base, as we have just seen, is from a phonetic
viewpoint exceedingly variable, a variability due to both phonetic and
morphological causes. In §§51-53 we shall group all the verbs in the
language according to the nature of the differences between the various
tense-aspect stems. Here we wish merely to present them in terms
of the number of roots each verb shows, leaving aside, for the moment,
the question whether they are primary or secondary.
Looked at in this way the verbs fall into three divisions: those that
have but one root, i.e., show no change; those that have two roots;
and those that have three. The first group need not detain us except
to state that it contains, at most, forty percent of the verbs, possibly
really not more than thirty per cent. The mhajority of the verbs belong
to the second and third divisions. As many examples are given in
the section on Types of Stem-Formation, I shall give here only enough
to show the nature of the stem variability. I am not including the
increments -lek- and -mok-.",[77]

§§32-33. PREFIXATION IN THE VERB§32. Introduction and List of Prefixes
Prefixation is an old but still living grammatical process in Wappo.
That it is old is proved by the nature and use of the local prefixes
(nos. 20-37 below), by the instrumental me-, the pronominal me-, te-,
and the indefipite objects ho- and ma-. Of these only me- instrumental
has an independent existence as a noun stem. The others are only
found as prefixes. That, on the other hand, prefixation is still an active
process is evidenced by the nature and behavior of such prefixes as
cu-, after; o'mi, weather; hLn-, sleep; wil, body, and perhaps even hu-,
head, etc.-all of which can be best designated as nouns and verbs
in varying conditions of transformation from an independent existence
to that of proclitics and prefixes. cu-, for instance, is a verb stem (cu'i)
little used at present, which has unquestionably become a true prefix
with specialized meaning. ami and hLn are noun stems still frequently
used as such. They are strictly speaking more of the nature of proclitics
than prefixes. But even here there are gradations, for ami is unquestionably becoming more of a real prefix than hLn, as is best indicated
by the change from original ama to o'mi. wil- and hu- are likewise
nouns of which the first is only an incorporated noun, rarely used, the
second a frequently used incorporated noun that is beginning to lose
its original meaning and to develop a semi-instrumental significance.
If, however, it must be admitted that prefixation is a living process
in Wappo today, that need not necessarily imply that such developments as cu- and o'mi- are a direct continuation of the same tendency
toward prefixation which gave rise to the local and pronominal prefixes.
It is on the contrary likely that there was a definite break between
these two periods; and that Wappo, during that interval, lost a number
of prefixes (these being possibly felt as the suffixes of pronouns and
nouns), that this period of ""prefixal"" decay was then arrested, and a
new ""prefixal"" tendency giving us cu-, etc., inaugurated. In Yuki
and Huchnom apparently this decay persisted until suffixation became
the only functional process.
With regard to the fusion of prefixes with the verb-stem, little need
be said. What exists is slight and of no particular significance and is
due to the slurring-of the vowel of the prefix, conditioned first, by the
influence of contiguous vowels and consonants and secondly, by the28University of CaZifornia Publcations in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[35, 36, 37]"
"There are probably more. However suggestive and important this
mutation of stem vowel may be historically it is not the usual method
for expressing the durative today. That is done exclusively by the
suffix -ce (occasionally -se), with frequent, but by no means universal,
change of preceding vowel to -i.
(b) Change of terminal vowel to -i:
All the indefinites in -se and -cc with ablauted vowel belong here:
Oti'-se, drown (*ata); t'api'-se, shout (*t'apa); mvki'-se, lie (*mvka), utsitsi'-ce,
get dark (*utsitsa), hutsati'-se, get well (*hutsata); huye'kc-sc, be glad (*huyeka);
kat'i'-se, twist (*kat'a); k-upi'-se, be rotten (*k-upa).",[73]
"[Vol. 27this doubling would seem to be analogous to the use of diphthongization for mode-aspect in Wappo. The following examples are taken
from Kroeber's sketch:10

cu'a, sit!; kacu'uhuk, I sit here§6. Accent
Accent, exclusively that of stress, is very strong and associated with
a definite syllable in each word. In disyllabic words it is always on the
first syllable and. in polysyllabic words it is practically always on the
antepenult. It can be stated, as a general rule, that the vowel accented
is the stem vowel and that it rarely shifts no matter how many suffixes
are added.
at'a'tasa, he leaches acorns, at'a'tattsta, he leached acorns; omiso'm-ci, it
becomes evening (som, stem); oko'heleksi, he is constipated (kohe, stem); omoti'se,
it overflows.(ti, stem).",[21]
"[Vol. 27impersonal, and inactive verbs; -a connected with transitive and active;
-u with the passive; -i with the durative-usitative, and -a with the
subjunctive.
So far, however, we have only considered the terminal vowels.
But in Wappo we find, not infrequently, that changes in the vowel of
the stem itself are correlated with changes in the meaning of certain
verbs; that, for instance, durative, intensive, diminutive, and other
activities are expressed by mutations in the initial consonant or the
basic vowel of the stem. That these are not accidental is indicated
by the fact that the consonantal change is from glottalized to unglottalized, from affricative to corresponding sibilant, from affricative to
corresponding stop, etc., and that the vocalic shifts are consistently
vowel to diphthong for intensive and vowel to -i for durative, etc.
It is certainly a significant fact that the terminal vowel ablaut is
almost exclusively connected with voice and mode,- and the consonantal and basic stem-vowel ablaut with the expression of aspect.
There is some reason for believing the first type of ablaut (terminal
vowel of disyllabic stems), to be a secondary Wappo trait not shared
by Yukian in general,33, but there seems no justification for so interpreting the second type. There are numerous indications in Yuki
proper, for example the meaning of vowel-doubling, etc., suggesting
that it is an old and fundamental Yukian trait.
In short, we may postulate at least eight bases: stem without a
formative; active-transitive -a-; intransitive-impersonal -i; passive -u;
durative -i; intensive diphthong; diminutive consonantal ablaut and
subjunctive-hortatory -a. To these must then be added the so-called
expanded, i.e., the increment, bases.
1. Active-transitive, -a.-Active and transitive does not perhaps completely define the force of this formative, for verbs in -a occur that
cannot be brought under this rubric. Some of these are undoubtedly
simply stems in -a, since not all verbs ending in -a have necessarily
had their final vowel interpreted as active-transitive. Certain forms
like hopi'la, it is full, as contrasted with opi'l-mi, to fill (transitive),
present difficulties. Either -a has in addition to its active-transitive
significance some other meaning not quite clear, or the -a of hopila is
the petrified causative -a, the verb consequently meaning, to make it
filled. The second is, I feel, the correct interpretation. In this case
we are fortunate enough to know that pil is the stem. In such examples,
however, as e'laca, to dig deep, as contrasted with its related o-e'li, to
dig out, we are in no such advantageous position. o-e'li is intransitive
33 I personally believe that it is a fairly old trait of Yukian.",[71]
"[Vol. 27we in America know so many, is an achievement of very doubtful
value, unless somehow, in some way, fundamental problems are touched
upon. They need not necessarily be comparative; they may concern
Wappo alone. With that ideal in view I have tried to show Wappo
in all its variety, have attempted to indicate all the meanings, vague,
indefinite, or clear-cut, that a given element may have. Throughout
I have sought to exhibit the language in all its multiplicity and fluidity;
to show how some of the elements are fixed and petrified, others utterly
unanchored. In thus presenting a dynamic study of a language of
whose history we are ignorant, I quite realize all the dangers I am
running, but if it will help, if only in a very moderate degree, to contribute something toward the solution of the problems connected with
the mechanism of linguistic changes, I shall be amply repaid.",[15]
"§118. Subordination
Practically all subordination is expressed by postpositions, by
appending nominal case suffixes, employing the absolute form of the
verb, using those with no grammatical suffixes at all or suffixes of
purely aspect signification, and finally by eliding the vowel of the tense
suffix.
The important subordinating postpositions are tsel (rarely tse) used
mainly with the indefinite and future tenses, wen or -kwen used mainly
with the past, and tseta and tu' used with any tense.
How fundamental is the position of these conjunctions is proved
by the fact that when tsel, tu', tseta precede the verb they never have
a subordinating meaning.
1. tsel, when, if.
The verb preceding tsel is either not affected at all, i.e., it appears
with its regular tense suffixes or this tense suffix loses its terminal
vowel, or finally, the verb appears in its absolute form either with or
without terminal vowel. Under what conditions these three distinct
influences of tsel upon the verb take place is not clear.
The indefinites in -i and the futures never lose their full endings.

"[Vol. 27§19. Modes
The following modes are known: indicative, subjunctive, hortatory,
and imperative. Of these the subjunctive is formed in a variety of
definite ways and at times irregularly; the hortatory regularly, by
mutation of terminal vowel to -a- and the imperative by various
suffixes. In addition to the regular imperative a supplicative imperative
is found.
§20. Tenses
Tenses occur in two forms, simple and periphrastic, the latter indicated by affixed auxiliary verbs. There are really only two tenses,
a true future and a past. The latter falls into a direct-visible and
responsive-visible or invisible. An indefinite-present occurs but this
is essentially to be regarded as an aspect.",[31]

in direct contrast to the past. The best explanation for this marked.1929]A rain""nar of the Wappo Language

of the participial-absolute suffixes (-k, -c, -s, -1) is always subordinate

to that of the English participle. In addition to this spurious type of
nominalization a true form also exists consisting of the appending of
the nominal suffix -noma and the case suffixes -ma, for, -i, with (only

"The t-a forms are not found in the texts often and the -a- subjunctive is on the whole not frequent. It would seem as if the subjunctive
is indicated not so much by change of terminal vowel to -a as by an
irregular vocalic mutation. Cf. discussion §72.
9. Expanded or increment bases.-To the numerous changes in the
nature of the base wrought by vocalic and consonantal ablaut we must
add those transformations caused by the fusion of suffixes with the
original verb-stem. As we have pointed out before these suffixes belong
to distinct strata in the language. Some must have lost whatever
meaning they possessed at an early period, others are only half understood and half functional today, while others are frequently used. As1929]Badin: A G-rammar of the Wappo Language67in very many instances these formatives are so firmly fused with the
stem that it is quite artificial to separate them, and as they have had,
after all, a long independent history, we shall treat the forms possessing them as definite bases and call them expanded and increment
forms.
Some of the suffix-formatives are fairly clear, e.g., -te-, -ta-, -1, -c-,
-s-; others moderately felt like -hv, -wv, -yv, etc., while a long series,
the petrified suffixes, are quite vague. Examples will be found in the
section on verbal suffixes (§34-64). Here only a few instances will
be given:
tsa'i-, tip over, tsul, tsel, turn over; kas, ka'tt, wear, wear around neck; tcoc,tcohi, tca'yi, put; tc'a'tc', tcu-su'p, tc*ul, tc'ap-, ts'up-, take or related meanings.
The reason for the disappearance of the older method of forming
aspects by vocalic and consonantal ablaut is to be ascribed to the
development of a large number of suffixes with aspect significance, to
the marked extension of such suffixes as the iterative and the continuative, and lastly, to the spread of the concept of tense. There
seems little question that such suffixes as -sv, -cV, -mi, -ki did not
originally have a predominatingly aspect connotation. The first three
were probably plurals and the last simply the past tense. What seems
to have taken place is the gradual transference to them of meanings
inherent in the vowel of the base. In some cases, as in a number of
indefinites in -sv, -or, the old ablauted vowel was preserved. Generally
it was lost. Perhaps the present development of the passive illustrates
exactly what occurred. Although -u- is beyond the shadow of a doubt
the sign of the passive and -ki merely the tense suffix, the idea of the
passive is being transferred to -ki to such an extent that passives are
now being formed without -u-.
It is just conceivable that some of the old ablauted bases have been
preserved in the vowels of the indefinite suffixes for we have the series,
-mi, -me-, -ma; -se, -si, -sa; -ce, -ci, -ca, and -i, -a, -e.","[75, 76]"
