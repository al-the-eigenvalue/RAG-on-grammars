the Yes/No question particle comes between the auxiliary re and the verb. In

"Clitics
Clitics are bound words. The word it binds to in the phrase or clause is
called its host. hust as affixes can be prefixes or suffixes, clitics can attach to
the beginning (pre-clitic) or the end (post-clitic) of a word. Euchee has both preclitics and post-clitics. Unlike affixes, which are bound to a specific part of
speech, clitics attach to a constituent. either a phrase or clause. For example. the
noun classes always move to the end of the noun phrase, so they may appear
after a bare noun, or a quantifier, or an adejctive; they are not always attached
to the noun itself. Since clitics can attach to several different hosts, they are
more loose1y bound than affixes. In Euchee, all one-sy llable independent
particles are stressed. If they are not stressed, due to emphasis elsewhere. they
can become cliticized to a host. The difference between ciitics and independent
words. then, is mainly phonological.
The Yes/No question particle 'le is an irrealis mode particle. It is alwaysan independent word. It is not phonologically reduced, but carries with it a
prominent stress. However, it has characteristics of a clause-level clitic. It
prefers to be after the first complete phrase in a clause, called a 'second position'
clitic. While Ye prefers the second position, it can be placed at the end of any
constituent in the clause. Because of this, it is a good test for constituency in
Euchee, Chapter 8, Section 3.1 Yes/No Questions for examples.
Most of the independent particles can be several phrase-level clitics when
unstressed. These attach to the phrase which they modify, and are typified by
the noun class/determiner post-clitics, the piural particle, the tense particle. This
is similar to the English 'not,' which must be attached to a host when it is
phonologically reduced, as in 'doesn't.'
Only the negative pre-clitic nP- - me- is always attached and can never be
an independent particle. The negative pre-clitic attaches to the besinning of
either the noun or the verb phrase, similar to the English 'I do not have any
urandchildren' and 'I have no grandchildren.'"" The evidence that they are boundr'and not free comes from the fact they follow the stress patterns of the verb and
noun. The negative pre-clitic bears secondary stress of the first syllable,
although they are often emphasized for pragmatic purposes. See Chapter 8.

negative pre-clitic nP- to 'all.' Thus, 'most of and 'a few of is literally 'not all of.'

The quantifier dzalale means 'both of (a plural).' It can also mean ?hose

a reciprocating or accompanying situation'. See Chapter 4, Section 3.3 for morediscussion and examples of k'aju. The reciprocal k'aju 'together' also has
pronominal agreement. When it refers to inanimates, it has the meaning 'both'
and generally has the stative -le, as seen in (32).","[457, 458]"

Negative Phrase
The sentential negative phrase is a pre-clitic on the verb phrase. The
Yes/No question panicle comes after the negative phrase, and so negative
cliticizes to the Yes/No question panicle.

"The affirmative answer hb 'yes' also functions as a mode panicle at the
end of an utterance."" Wagner (1934: 354) states that hb is an emphatic suffix.
The affirmative hb is emphatic in the sense that when ones affirms onecommitment to a future action or affirms one's belief that something is possible,
it is generally more emphatic than withodi such confirmation. However, thebasic conlent and function is one of affirming and confirming not emphasis.",[343]
Negative warnings are formed with the negative pre-clitic on the verb.,[324]
"The affirmative can also confirm one's knowledge about a past event or
state. An example is in (96a). Using -hd with past events often gives an
emphatic quality to the statement, as in (96b).",[344]

"3.1 Y ES/NOQUESTIONS: t E AND 'YA
Yes/No questions are a type of question where the expected answer is
'yes' or 'no.' Yes/No questions are fonned with the irrealis mode particle ye,?although )a can be used in the conditions described below. In addition to a
mode particle, Yes/No questions are signaled by rising intonation.
Wagner (1934: 357) called the particle 'Ie a suffix and described the
placement as verb final, except for the attachment to the negative pre-clitic n2-.
This overlooks two importatn facts about Ye. First, it can be found at the end of
most complete phrases (noun phrase, postposition phrase, verb phrase). Second,
it has a propensity to be found in the second position (in the position after thefirst phrase of a sentence). These facts make it a likely candidate for a clitic (or
bound word). However, there is evidence that the morpheme is an independent
word. First, 'Ze is not reduced phonologically but always bears the most
prominent stress of the utterance and is generally accompanied by high pitch.
Second, like other irrealis particles, 7e can be the verbalizer for verbal nouns.
The Yes/No question marker 'le prefers to be in the second position, that
is, after the end of the first phrase. When there is an independent noun phrase,
the panicle can be in second positon (after the noun phrase) or after the verb
phrase. In these positions, the question marker has scope over the whole
sentence. If the particle comes after any other phrase, it changes the focus to
that phrase.
Because the Yes/No question marker 'le must appear at the end of a
phrase, it can be used as a test to determine the boundaries of phrases
(constituents). The end of phrases often coincides with the end of words, and as
such, it has been helpful in determining suffixes from clitics. Therefore, most of
the patterns are given below to amply illustrate its placement. Although not all
the possible sentence patterns are given in the sections below. the rule that the
Yes/No question particle must be at the end of a complete phrase and its
preference for second position is illustrated in the common sentence patterns
below. These are followed by the exceptions.","[477, 478]"
"However, in general the potential is used for situations which have not yet
occurred and to express politeness. In contrast, the probability auxiliary lete
tends to express the speakers belief about a present situation. However. these
can be interchanged, and the potential gd can be combined with the auxiliary to
express doubt about the future.
The probability auxiliary is used with the active verbalizer. As such, it is
commonly used a s a complete expression. In (@a) below, the l l ~ r e 2is a general
non-committal answer 'maybe.' With the ability re attached, the response is 'it
could be,' as in (64b). In ( 6 4 ~ ) is
. a similar response 'maybe' using the auxiliary
re, combined with encouragement ICP and the affirmative hb. However, this isusually restricted to giving consent, pemission, or some future commitment on
the part of the speaker. Finally, the sentence in (64d) is often used to express
'maybe.'",[325]
"The negative pre-clitic n2- can be stressed or unstressed. When it is
stressed, it has high pitch. The pronunciation of ni- is often lnie-/.' The negative
pre-clitic ni- can be attached to the verb or a noun. In both cases, it is the

"Finally, the verbalizer '2 can be the stem on which the negative pre-clitic canattach, as seen in (25) below. Because of these facts, the verbalizer 9 is treated

"In contrast to ksa, the potential gfi indicates that the speaker is not
committed to the truth of the assertion. Thus, it is an irrealis mode. In English,
the potential is expressed in several ways 'might,' 'could,' 'perhaps,' 'may be,' and
even 'I guess.' These can also be expressed in the mode auxiliary I i ~ r e
'probabilily' discussed above in Section 4.3. The terns and meanings are very
similar, and both are types of imealis. However, 'potential' means that
something is not yet in existence. The potential gb usually refers to the speakers
doubts about future situations. So, 'potential' is used for the irrealis particle gii.
'Probable' means that something is likely. The probability auxiliary l ~ ~ usually
re
refers to situations in the present. However, there is much overlapping in use.
The difference can be seen in the two sentences below.",[331]
"The particle iva is the only realis particle. It conveys the meaning that a
situation is true. It can be translated as 'islwas' or 'do/did. ' It can be used
forcefully to assert the speakers certainty of the truth, and in these cases means
'sure isisure did.' Wagner (1934: 354) stated that k a is an emphatic suffix. In
contrast to the irrealis. the realis by asserting the truth is more emphatic.
However, the particle h a does much more than provide emphasis.
As the realis mode particle, it functions as the neutral copula 'be' verb. In
other words, it 'couples' two nouns together as a sentence. The second nounidentifies the first noun. Because of this prominent role, the realis particle wa is
glossed in the interlinear text as 'cop' for copula. The copula function of h a can
be seen below.

PL(INAN)This section describes complex sentences which have two clauses: an
independent (main) clause and a dependent (embedded) clause. An independent
clause is fully inflected with agreement, and can be inflected for aspect, tense,
and mode. It can be a complete sentence by itself. A dependent clause relies
on another clause for part of its inflection or meaning, or both.
Euchee has two types of dependent clauses. Small clauses (non-finite
compIements) are characteristically different from the other dependent clauses
(finite complements). Causative verbs, the verb 'want' and sensory verbs require
small clause complements. The other dependent clauses include noun clauses
(complements),adjective clauses (relative clauses), and adverb clauses.","[505, 506, 507]"
"5 15This chapter describes how noun phrases, verb phrases (including the
verbals structures), and particles are put together to form longer utterances.
People do many things with language. We make statements concerning the
world around us (declarative sentences). We ask questions, and sometimes
command someone to do or not to do something. Each of these kinds of
utterances has one (or more) specific constructions. Statement, question, and
command forms can then be used for a variety of other functions. For example,
questions can be used to make requests or invitations. Statements can also show
empathy, expectation, or obligation. These functions are shown through the
mode particles and auxiliaries following verbs and are found in Chapter 5. The
first three sections of this chapter describes the construction (syntax) of utterancetypes.","[469, 470]"

"These verbalized question words are often used as the main clause in
specific information questions. This causes the content verb to be an embedded
clause. Thus, questions such as 'Where did you go?' or 'What is this called?' are
literally 'Where is it that you have been?' and 'How is it that you call this thing?'
Several examples of this construction are given in (38). In (38a) the content verb

embedded clauses is also possible. The example in (38c) also shows that the
content verb 'eat' is embedded since it has requires the begative pre-clitic Itcr-,

Unlike the emphatic -:le, the particle -gd can not be used on verbs. It isused only with adjectives. Because it is associates with adejctives, more
examples and discussion of -gi is in Chapter 7, Section 2.47. AUDITORY EVIDENCE:-Ke
Evidentials are markers which indicate the source of information for a
proposition. Euchee uses -ke to report an event that the speaker hears but does
not see. It is therefore an auditory eviden~ial.
A typical use of the auditory -ke is shown in (89a). The sentence is anassertion 'They're coming' and the evidential -ke gives the additional meaning of'I hear them.' However, the verb cannot agree with the speaker. The same
meaning can be expressed with verb chkZ 'hear' in the main clause, as seen in
(89b). This time the speaker is the actor of 'I hear' and there is no evidential.","[338, 339]"
"5.5 QUESTIONING:
i!.e
The Yes/No question particle is a n irrealis mode particle. Like the other
panicles, it can cause any stem to be read a s a verb. In this case, the truth ofthe situation expressed in the verb is questioned. This function of 'le is clear in
the examples below, where Ye is the only verbalizing particle.

Unlike the other irrealis panicles, the Yes/ No question particle can beused in all types of verbal constructions in order to ask a question. The
placement is like a clitic in that must come at the end of a complete phrase and
it prefers to be placed after the first full phrase in an utterance (the secondposition). The placement of he Yes/No question particle 'le is detailed in

examples are given below. The terse or mode particles are underlined. Thestress is always on the last syllable of the stem 'diand so the particles are

\f,/\1/[dlikwii;j\/Contracted Form'' The contraction process in Euchee has been described by Wagner (1934: 302)
and Ballard (1975: 166), and minimally by Crawford (1973: 176). Both Wagner
and Ballard listed the changes associated with the contraction of the non-Euchee
we morpheme. which show a systematic backing and rounding of the vowel
immediately preceding the deleted rve morpheme. Their changes are reproduced
below, in their phonetic transcriptions:40) Wagner's Description

l6\/17In this section on contraction, all of the examples from hames Crawford (JC)
are pulled from an unpublished manuscript entitled 'Yuchi' and his notes for this
manuscript. The examples are from his notebooks of text and direct elicitation of
forms with Mrs. Nancy Wildcat. The manuscript appears to have been for his
class on the Euchee at Georgia State University.
I8
One speaker does contract the 3"" person singular pronominal /he-/ to /h~-1.
19
The vowel shifts for the ho- and hi- contraction look the same as in wecontraction, with the exception of the diphthong [ao] produced with assimilation
to /a/. The diphthong [ao] is the sole evidence for the [+round]feature of the /w/
to spread left. Otherwise, like the /h/ deletion, the roundness is due to the fact
that all back vowels in Euchee are round.
O' Both [gdspi] 'black person' and [gaka] 'white person' are commonly used with
all Euchee. even those who do not speak the Euchee language.
'I This example is from Sadie Skeeter, who was from Duck Creek. Thus. this is
not an instance of the Big Pond Dialect dialect variation /wid instead of we-.
"" Rankin (1997; from Ballard (1974:17) gives a set not listed here: side 'naked'
and sllitle 'bald. bare.' I have checked this with three speakers (representing
both dialects and both genders). All of them use only one side for both
meanings, and none have heard shirle. Since some speakers palatalize Is/ before
a high vowel (see Section 1.2 of this chapter) is probable that difference here is
due to the phonological palatization rule, not lexicalization.
This is apparently the same conclusion that Crawford (1980) was reaching.
What is interesting is that even though Euchee is not as synthetic as many of the
languages of the Americas, it still behaves like a polysynthetic language. in the
sense of Baker (1996). This includes the mandator): pronominal agreement, freer
word order, and discontuous constituents. Other characterstics are noted
throughout this work. it shouid be noted that although the ianguage is not tigntiy''bound together, the process of cliticization is productive. Its relationship to stress
and the continuum with affixation need funher attention.
Speakers today cannot analyze this morpheme in the word for 'tax.' However,
Wagner (ca. 1935) gives the word for 'tax' as [tapihotigokSnC]. In his example,
the first morpheme [tapi] appears to be 'salt.' I am assuming his earlier
transcription as [thlebi] is a possible compti onAs salt has always been a valued
resource in human societies, it is possible that the word refers to payment by or
for salt. As this idea became obsolete, the language appears to have added sh
'land' (and in some variations jk'alal 'thing') without having dropped the 'salt.'
?-F Many of the locatives are derived from nouns. For example, sk is the
'ground/earrh' as well as 'down' and /ta/ is 'face' as well as 'on.' This can be one
reason for their independent status and behavior with the location suffixes.
26 Gatschet recorded only two Panicle + Verb Constructions, and he wrote the
panicle separate from the verb (1885: 38). Speck (ca. 1904-1923) discusses
'general' locatives [locative particles] as separate panicles (p. 41), but then he
writes them on the verb or almost attached. This was a device he used 'when
the connection is close' (p. 40). He later gives four 'specialized' locatives as
'nearer to being verbal prefixes' (p. 48). The difference between hi 'general' and
'specialized' locatives is not clear, and is not the same has my distinction
between the generalized location/direction suffixes and the locative particles.
Wagner, roo, had trouble determining the status of the locative particles.
The locative panicles were treated as noun suffixes in his 1930 publication. and
then changed to verb prefixes in the grammatical sketch (1934: 358). Neither
Ballard nor Crawford discuss the locative particles, but in their field notes they
are treated as attached to the verb and presumably treated as verb prefixes
(Ballard ca. 1972-75; Crawford 1972-1973).
7' Since verbs are inflected for person and can be full clauses. technically the
negative preclitic is also a clause-level clitic. ow eve-(, for the purposes of
description of Euchee, it is more convenient to group the negative preclitic with
the other phrase-level clitics.

This could be argued to be a case of overgeneralization to the habitual
morpheme [-nil.","[134, 135, 136, 137]"
"He did not record who his primary linguistic consultants were for his
vocabulary and grammatical analyses. However, he collected tales in
Euchee from Ekiq'ane (Ekilnme Cahwee, or Mr. Lewis Long), Mr.
Washington Holder, and Mr. Joe Allen. He collected nineteen tales. a
migration legend, several proverbs and lore. and one narration entitled
'Regarding God' (NAA MS# 1278 and MS# 3133). His text notebooks
comprise a major contribution to the record of the Euchee language.
However, each needs extensive work with a current speaker. to the point
of being re-elicited, as Speck was not consistent in recording nasalization.

"Information (or content) questions are questions in which the response
contains information beyond 'yes' or 'no.' Information questions contain a
question word (interrogative pronoun). The question words not only signal that
the clause is a question, but they indicate what kind of information is being
asked. With the exception of w i k 'what,'
~
all the question words are formed withthe question stem wa. The question word has rising pitch (indicated with a [;I),but the end of question has falling intonation. With only a few exceptions, the
rising pitch is on the second syllable of the information word. The list of
question words is in (34).

"The present tense is unmarked. The present tense is essentially
imperfective, meaning that the event can be opened up and its texture or
structure can be further defined. So, verbs in the present can take the other
aspect suffixes, such as the habitual and repeated. Without being marked for
habitual, consecutive, repeated, etc., present tense verbs express that the action
or state is in progress or continuing at the time of the utterance (progressive.
continuous aspect), although they can represent something that is generally true.","[292, 293]"

REALISAND IRREALISEuchee has a set of mode particles which express the speakers beliefs
about what is real (irrealis) and what is unreal (the irrealis). There is one realis
particle in Euchee. The particle 'wa expresses certainty that a situation has
occurred, is knowable, or is true. There are several irrealis panicles. Most are
concerned with future action. Since the future has not happened yet, it is
'unreal.' They express the potential g6, expectation La, intention n6. In addition,
the Yes/No question particle is an irrealis particle in Euchee: If one questions the
situation the truth, it is not yet real to the questioner.
All of the irrealis mode particles are verbalizers. They can follow nouns,adjectives, and quantifiers in order to give them a verbal reading. This function
is introduced in each of the following sections. However, the process is treated
as a whole in Chapter 7: Other Verbal Structures.
The realis/irrealis mode particles follow the verb or the mode auxiliaries.
When the mode particles are combined with the mode auxiliaries, they tend to
loose stress and become attached. However, when they function as the
verbalizer for nouns and adjectives, they have stress and are independent
particles.","[326, 327]"
