wafnem 'to be lazy', waka 'to be jealous', wamar 'to be tired', wandar 'to be shy', wantek 'to
be ill '. The verb mom (see §4.6) also occurs with wa-: wamom 'to want not'. I have no
explanation yet for the origin of wa-. According to my language consultants the form wa
comes from wow 'body' or mwan 'face, appearance', for instance: wamar 'to be tired'
consists of wow-mar 'body-tired', wantek 'to be ill ' is claimed to be mwan-tek 'face-hot'.

"11 Adverbs
On the basis of meaning and function, adverbs can be subdivided into types of location,
time, aspect, mode and negation. Adverbs do not take prefixes or suffixes and occur in
clause-initial and/or in clause-final position. Adjectives such as mambom 'lazy', frenkak
'wrongly', mafun 'beautifully' etc., can be used adverbially, as can NPs, like put manki 'day
this' for 'today' . Examples are:(1 69)A-mambom a-tum
dwaw.
3sM-Iazy
3SM-shoot pig
He shoots badly at the pig (that is, he misses).",[31]
"8 Questions
Questions are marked morphologically. Though questions are not expressed by means of
intonation alone, question-marking clitic -e is realised with a salient, large rising or falling
pitch movement.",[23]
"Na-k(i).2sG-make garden at-3SF-where to-here
Where are you making a garden? Right here.
There also exists a form for 'here' whose internal structure is not clear yet: mbano

"1 5.2 Other uses of the form rna
The form rna is also used in question words, as shown in (244H246):(244)Maria-nrna-n ?n-yenMaria-3SF 3SF-mother who- 3SF
Who is Maria's mother?",[42]
"6 Nouns
Nouns are of the following types: simple nouns, compounds, alienable and inalienable
nouns. Nouns referring to human beings are marked for gender. Nouns have possessive
inflection by means of bound pronouns prefixed to inalienable nouns and by means of the
subject prefixed verb tar or bi 'to possess' preceding the alienable noun. Nouns as head of
noun phrases can be modified by adjectives, numerals and demonstratives following the
noun. Loans are predominantly from neighbouring languages: Numforese, Irianese Malay or
Standard Indonesian, but also from Dutch. Since loans do not behave differently from
original Mpur words, they will not be further discussed.",[16]
"1 1. 5 Adverbs of mode
Adverbs of mode tend to occur clause-finally, at least post-predicate, following the object
if that is expressed. Adverbs of mode refer to the (im)possibility, necessity etc. of the event
expressed by the verb. Such adverbs are sik/tasik 'impossible, useless , fari 'possible/able.to',
as in:
'( 1 94)Bwan-o bwan-o bwan-o sik.

All the calling didn't help.",[34]
"8.1 Question marker -e
Question marker -e is an utterance-final clitic occurring in yes/no questions. For example:( 1 04)An-bwana an-kon-e?

Do you want to sleep?",[23]
"There are no indigenous words for ' week', 'month' or 'year'. Mpur speakers use
I ndonesian words, but for 'year' the compound bra-n-ka-wa is sometimes used, from
classifier bra for long things, demonstrative pronoun n-ka '3SF-that' and aspect adverb pa
'already'. For 'month' the form man is used from the Dutch loan maand.",[32]
"11.1 Adverbs of location
Adverbs of location follow the predicate with(out) object and indicate where the action
expressed by the verb takes place. For instance:(171)bwaner.
A-jap
3SM-live far
He lives far away.",[31]
"3.2 Reflexivity
Reflexivity is expressed by means of free pronouns. It can be emphasised by do 'self,
alone', which has subject prefixation and often occurs in combination with numeral tu 'one'
to express exclusivity. Examples of the two expressions of reflexivity are:
( 1 0)In-tik-warin.",[9]
"7 Deictics
I n Mpur a distinction exists between spatial and textual deictics, the forms of which occur
in combinations as summarized in Table 4. As we will see, the deictic system is not a simple
issue at all. As said in my introduction, research carried out for the present article was
limited and does not answer many questions I still have, and the examples shown in this
section leave us with a great deal of uncertainty. Table 4 presents the forms of deictics:

is not indicated in Table 4. Note that the form ba-ni is used in Amberbaken and, according
to my Kebar consultant, equivalent to the Kebar form ka-ni.
Spatial deictics are expressed by the basic demonstrative pronouns ki 'here/this' and ka
'there/that' referring, respectively, to a distance near and a distance further away from the
speaker. The demonstratives are illustrated in the following example:(80)Ah n-bwar kananpan-bwarkian-bwar jan.ah I SG-say that you already I SG-say this 2SG-say
Ah, I already told you, I said don't you say anything.notThe basic demonstratives ki and ka are frequently prefixed by what is likely the
morpheme n '3SF'. They are shown in three nominal clauses:(8 1 )Baban n-ka?",[20]
"Anja16 Clitics
Clitics are monosyllabic morphemes attached to lexical words of different classes, but
usually not on prepositions. Clitics are meaningful elements and in Mpur frequently have a
salient intonation and syllable lengthening. All clitics are enclitics which modify a word, a
clause or a whole utterance. The interrogative clitic -e is discussed separately in §7. The
same form is used with an apparently different function. The other clitics -a, -i, -0 function
in discourse as, for instance, vocatives, continuation, focus and temporal markers, as
expression of (emotive) emphasis. It is hard to tell the different meanings of the clitics apart,
and I did not study the issue thoroughly enough to explain the differences. Working on the
translations of texts, Mpur informants were often unable to indicate what a given clitic
means. Despite this some examples are presented below.
Clitic -a occurs as a vocative for persons: nen-a! 'Mum-voc!'. It is used to call someone
who is not far away (otherwise -0 is used, see below):A sketch of Mpur 87

The most frequent use is in combination with the verb ut 'to stay' forming the compound
construction umu and with the demonstratives ka 'that.there' and ki 'that.here'. Mu is always
preceded by a verb. Though its use is not yet clear to me, the presentative is shown in a few

1.1 Background of the Mpur language
Mpur is a Non-Austronesian language with three lexical tones and is spoken by
approximately 5 ,000 speakers in the north east Bird's Head area, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. In
the literature Mpur is sometimes referred to as Kebar or Amberbaken, which are geographic
names for the two regions where it is spoken.
Mpur is a phylum-level isolate with dialectal differences in at least lexicon and prosody
between speakers in the Kebar Valley, in the mountains (East Kebar) and on the coast
(Amberbaken), respectively. The lexicon is of Papuan origin, but morphology and syntax
show Austronesian features (Reesink 1 998 :603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order
and the absence of heavy verb morphology. Many loans entered Mpur from Numforese,
Irianese Malay, Standard Indonesian, and also some from Dutch. I ndonesian is taught in
village schools by non-Mpur teachers, but they play truant as much as Mpur children do. In
town Mpur children learn I ndonesian more properly and only they are fairly able to
distinguish between Indonesian and Mpur words. Only a few Mpur speakers are literate in
Mpur, though much progress has been made in Kebar since G. and C. Kalmbacher (Irian Jaya
Bethany Foundation and Summer Institute of Linguistics) began to give literacy courses with
educational materials in the villages of that area; literacy in Indonesian is much better.
Speakers of Mpur do not know the origin of the name Mpur. Coastal Mpur speakers refer
to Mpur speakers in the Kebar Valley as ma-ye 'who are outside' (lit. REL-outside), that is, at
the other side of the eastern Tamrau mountains. Kebar people call Papuan people maksam,
most likely from mam-kesam 'person from Irian' (lit. person-big.forest), in contrast to matem
'white people' from mam-war-tem 'person-mouth-river'. So far I have no explanation for the
term Mpur which is only used to refer to the language.
The Mpur-speaking community has been extensively described by Miedema ( 1 9 84) and
many examples of their oral tradition have been published in M iedema ( 1 997). The story
Kaman ja 'Squash seeds', for the first time presented in this article, is an old story but a new
item to Miedema's collection.","[1, 2, 3]"
"A sketch of Mpur 7 1
I n combination with verbs that do not express motion, for example jap 'to sit, live',
dakbar 'to work ', the preposition ma indicates a more permanent physical presence, while ku
conveys a more temporary meaning.","[26, 27]"
"4.3 Verb sequences
Sequences of verbs are a common phenomenon in Mpur. They occur without any
conjunction and all verbs in such a sequence are finite and thus obligatorily inflected.
There are a few criteria according to which sequences of verbs in Mpur actually could be
cases of verb serialisation: conjunctions do not occur between the verbs, a clause boundary
occurs only after the last verb, the subject is the same for all verbs, verbs may also occur
individually in a clause, verbs form together a prosodic group (no pauses between verbs, a
single intonation contour). Three examples are:(27)Do-undo-mimdo-fasubweAri-a a-tem.",[11]
"68Cecilia Ode8.2 Question words
Content questions occur with specific question words some of which have the question
marker -e. Question words usually occur in the same syntactic position as the element they
are questioning would occur in. There is no utterance-final question marker -e in content
questions. Question words are given in ( 1 0 8 ) together with their assumed morphological

feminine (see examples ( 1 1 2) and ( 1 1 3)).

subjects, but note that (mi)nton 'child ', mamir 'person ', nkan 'old person ' , mampu

know the gender. The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.","[9, 10]"

"2.5 Intonation
Some intonation patterns have been dealt with in Ode ( 1 996, 1 997). A description of
Mpur tones and intonation is still in progress and will be published separately. For the time
being only some limited notes on intonation are presented.
A general tendency is observed to realise large pitch movements at prosodic boundaries (a
pause, silence, hesitation, reset), for which the final syllable is then lengthened. At the end of
declaratives pitch usually moves downwards. Interrogatives and continuations cannot be
expressed by intonation alone: interrogatives take question markers (§8) which have their
'own' tones, and enclitics are used to express a continuation (§ 1 6). The importance of a word
in an utterance, as a means of accent, is highlighted by focus marker ni (see §7), by enclitics
or by repeating words (of most word classes), examples of which can be found in the text at
the end of this article. Enclitics especially have salient falling or rising pitch movements.
The expression of emotive emphasis has been described in Ode ( 1 997, 1 998).",[7]
"3SM-go to Saukorem
He is on his way to Saukorem.",[26]
"2.3 Tones
On the basis of an experimental phonetic approach, described in, for example, Ode
( 1 996), three tones have been attested in Mpur: high, mid and low. The issue still is whether a
fourth midrising tone, existing on the perceptual level, is phonologically significant. The
analysis in progress of the results of a last set of experiments is expected to answer this
question.
Generally speaking, the range between high and low, expressed on a logarithmic scale, can
be up to twelve semitones, which in musical terms is equivalent to one octave. But note that
tones and intonation in speech are not perceived on the same logarithmic scale as music (Ode
1 996: note 1 0). The range between high and low in absolute terms, that is, expressed in
hertz, is of course speaker dependent. Tone sandhi, the influence of tones on the realisation
of adjacent tones, is a normal phenomenon in Mpur that together with other tonal and
intonational phenomena will be described in Mpur tones and intonation: an experimental
phonetic analysis with interlinearized texts (Ode, in process). Downdrift (i.e. in a sequence
of high-low-high tones, the latter high tone is lower than the former) and downstep (i.e. the
phonological lowering of the second of two tones of the same type) are not observed in Mpur.
In spontaneous speech there can be some declination (i.e. the fundamental frequency declines
gradually in the course of an utterance). See also Ode ( 1 996:86).
Table 3 presents the three lexical tones with phonetic specification, that is, the level of the
tone in semitones (ST) measured above the lowest (zero semitones) level of a register of
twelve semitones of a speaker, and examples. These are maximum values. The actual
realisation of tones can be higher or lower than indicated in the table, depending on utterance
position, melodic context, tone sandhi, intonation and the idiosyncrasy of the speaker. High
and low tones are marked with ' and ' , respectively, on vowels; mid tone remains unmarked.",[6]
"2 Phonology
Mpur is a language with lexical tone contrasts. To my knowledge it is, together with the
neighbouring Abun language (Berry & Berry 1 999), the only Non-Austronesian tone
language in the Bird's Head area.
A detailed phonology of Mpur by G. Kalmbacher is in preparation, of which a draft
(Kalmbacher 1 996) was kindly offered to me by the author. The data presented here do not
necessarily agree with all data in Kalmbacher's phonology. This is especially the case with
respect to word stress and the tone system, but differences will not be discussed. Full
responsibility for this short phonology is mine.",[4]

A number of adverbs specify aspectual meanings of the clause and usually follow the
predicate and object (if present). Some examples are:A sketch ofMpur 77

Verbs are not inflected for the marking of Tense-Mood-Aspect. The imperative is
expressed by a verb inflected for the second person and can be strengthened by the clause­
final demonstrative ka: an-det ka 'you-eat that' 'you must eat'. The prohibitive is expressed
by jan 'not' or by jan pa 'not anymore' (lit. not already). For example:(49)Am-bopsansun ka.",[15]

"48Cecilia Ode1 .2 A personal note
The present article is a sketch of Mpur. The main aim of my research was an experimental
phonetic study of prosody in Bird's Head languages, more specifically of Mpur and Abun.
Because of the time-consuming character of such studies, morphology and syntactics did not
get the attention it deserved. A description of Abun has recently been published (Berry &
Berry 1 999), but Mpur is still mostly a blank spot on the language map of the Bird's Head.
A phonology (Kalmbacher 1 996, MS), a limited wordlist and some other works have been
written by G. and C. Kalmbacher. Though a full description of the Mpur language was never
my intention, I nevertheless collected enough data to undertake the challenge of writing this
article, largely encouraged to do so by my fellow researchers. Yet quite a few issues remain
insufficiently described or explained, and in some cases that is even an understatement.
H owever, since I do have quite a bit of data from the language and since it is unlikely that
anyone else will study the language in detail soon, I have decided to present an analysis of
what I have collected so that the language will not remain completely undocumented except
for its phonetics.
Data for this article were collected during three periods of fieldwork in 1 99 3-94, 1 995
and 1 998 in the Kebar valley and in Amberbaken. Apart from the work by G. and C.
Ka1mbacher mentioned above, which became accessible to me only later, no data on the
Mpur language were available. I worked intensively with Amanda Ajoi and Seppy Wabia in
Anjai, the Kebar Valley, and in Saukorem, Amberbaken, with Seppy Wabia, Markus Wabia,
Moses Warijo and a few other people. Twice I met the Kalmbachers in Kebar and discussed
many Mpur issues with them. For a study of the three dialects I visited lenderau (East
Kebar) and Nekori (over the mountains behind Jenderau) and along the Amberbaken coast
the villages from Arfu to Wau. In all areas mentioned I worked with indigenous inhabitants
of the villages and recorded their speech on tape.
This article reflects the limitations explained above and will mainly present word classes,
morphological processes and, where this seems adequate, some syntactic information.","[3, 4]"
"The aspectual meaning of the prepositions ku and ma is also reflected when used in

instance, put tu put tu 'day one day one' for 'always' or kiti kiti 'sometimes' are also used.

cover' (John Bowden, pers. comm.). Some verbs like farkor 'to learn' and f(a)nander 'to
forget' are wholesale borrowings from Numforese (note that the vowel a of fa- is often
omitted).","[12, 13]"

"14 Classifiers
Mpur has a large number of classifiers that are obligatory in combination with numerals
which they precede. Though I don't know their exact number, I found over twenty different
classifiers. For example, bik for counting houses andfi for counting persons and animals:(226)janbikdenurhouse CLF three
three houses(227)ntonfirokir

testicles1 5 Relativisation and the form ma
The form rna is observed in various languages of the Bird's Head area. Reesink
( 1 998:626ff.) discusses the different functions of mao To supplement his article I present
some other functions which rna has in Mpur, in addition to sections 7- 1 0 where the form has
also been discussed.
My informants indicated that preposition rna 'at, to' and ma as relative marker have
different tones: high tone and mid tone, respectively. I analysed many examples of rna and
found that in both functions the tone realised in context fluctuates considerably; pronounced
in isolation I did not find any difference in tone: both were realised with mid tone. The form
is so frequently used, that a discrete difference in tone would have been noticed.
For the time being, the different rna, which, in spite of native speakers' judgements, are
considered homophonous, to be distinguished are:
(a)as relative marker, introducing relative clauses;(b)as relative marker in Headless RC, resembling a nominalising particle;(c)on attributive adjectives in RC;A sketch ofMpur
(d)as marking demonstratives;(e)in question words (examples (244}-(246));(f)as preposition (example (247)).","[39, 40, 41]"

Loc-outsideThere are a number of spatial nouns which can only follow the anchoring noun when they
themselves are marked with the preposition be. The whole locative phrase may be governed
by either be or by the locative prepositions ku 'to/at', ma 'in, at' and pu 'to/at.far.away' and si
'to'. Note that at the moment of speaking in such constructions instead of locative be, the
locative preposition ku 'to/at' expresses absence, ma presence. For example, in ( 1 58) and
( 1 59), instead of be, ma would have the aspectual meaning 'still present', and ku 'not present
anymore' (see also §9).
Spatial nouns are shown in the following examples:74Cecilia Ode

Spatial prepositions are ke 'to', ku 'to, at, in', ma 'to, at, in', pu 'to, at, in', si 'to', koso
'along (a combination of ku and si?)' and, in fixed combinations with words expressing
spatial orientation, be andfe. The latter two will be discussed in § 1 0. Prepositions ku and pu
can take the prefix ba-: ba-ku, ba-pu . As mentioned in §7, I have no explanation for ba-.
The meaning of preposition pu 'to, at, in ' is said to have the meaning 'tolat far away',
