Of the two kinds of nouns that can be derived from verbs,verbal noun refers to an abstract or concrete nominal quality of a
verb, and the agentive noun refers to a person or an object that
performs an action or is typified by it. There are two kinds of
agentive nouns, regular agentive nouns, which are fully productive,
and nouns derived by old nominalization, which is no longer
productive.
Verbal Nounsultimate syllable of the noun, unless the penultimate syllable isA’verbal noun is a derived noun that refers to a quality of the
verb from which it is derived, such as ficcakhilkd ‘jealousy’ from
ficcakkin ‘to be jealous’ and cayahka ‘walking’ from cayéhlin ‘to
walk.’ Verbal nouns are essential to the verb paradigm, because
they serve functions similar to the English infinitive or gerund.
The verbal noun for verbs of all classes, except class 2A, is
formed from the first person plural affirmative form of the verb,
without phrase-terminal markers. The accent usually falls on thenaturally long, whereupon that syllable is accented. Thus, from the
verb hi:can ‘to see,’ where vowel length is not organic, the verbal
noun ilhica is formed; from halon ‘to hear,’ where vowel length is
organic, the noun ifha:la is formed. Frequently, as in ilha:la, the273If a noun must be derived from such a verb, it is thepermit the formation of two verbal nouns usually will; thus the
nouns wilapkact ‘a plow’ and wilapkaca ‘plowing’ are derived from
wilapli:cin ‘to plow.’

better solution is to propose that very early on, probably in the
Proto-Muskogean period, there was a series of suffixed subject
cross-reference markers that were elisive. They deleted the finalvowel of verbs with a final syllable structure of VCV, and deletedthe element -fi from verbs with a final syllable structure VCii.
However, if a verb had a syllable structure terminating in VCCV,
the markers could not be suffixed, as a three-member consonantThe solution was to infix the cross-cluster would be produced, which was not permissible in the
language, as it is not permissible in modern Koasati. Consonant
cluster simplification would cause serious semantic problems with
either the verb or the suffix.","[97, 98]"

at the present. A full description of the origins of the verb classes
is beyond the scope of this work. Where it is deemed necessary,
historical matter will be included to aid comprehension, but no
complete diachronic description of the classes will be undertaken.
Each verbal class will be described separately, so far as possible.
At the beginning of each description will be given a skeleton outline
of the affirmative and negative subject cross-reference markers,
followed by a table of inflected examples. The tables will not
include an entry for the third person plural, as the third personform is used indifferently for singular or plural cross-reference. Thealongwiththeagentivenouns,which,becauseof theirprefix he-/oh-, considered by Haas and others to mark the third
person plural, is actually a distributive and indefinite prefix. It is
discussed along with the other verbal prefixes in chapter 4. In
addition to the subject cross-reference markers, the verbal noun will
be given in the tables for each verb that forms one, as the verbal
noun forms an essential part of the verb paradigm. The verbalnouns,multiplicity will not be given in the tables, will be discussed fully in
chapter 7. Finally, a list of verbs belonging to closed classes with a
small number of members will be given.

Haas. However, with the

of
class 1B it is now one of two
classes in the first conjugation.

1A is typified by prefixing its
Subject cross-reference markers.
The negative subject crossreference markers are also prefixed; additionally the negativecomplement -9 is suffixed.* The roots that make up this class allhave the syllable structure CVCV or iCV. However, not all verbswith this syllable pattern belong to this class; wa:cin ‘to wait for’ isma ‘that,’ yé:fa ‘that (nearby); there,’ and méfa ‘that there; over
there.’ To further
complicate the situation, the verbs ynmin ‘io be so’ (the aspirate

Word OrderThe most unmarked word order of a sentence is subject, object,
verb (SOV). If there is an indirect object and the direct object is
not present in the sentence, the order is subject, indirect object,
verb (SIoV). If both a direct and indirect object are overt, the
order is usually subject, object, verb, indirect object (SOVIo),
although SIoOV can occur (see chap. 13, example 17). If there is
a locative phrase (a noun in one of the locational cases, a noun
followed by a postposition, a locational noun), it follows the verb(SOVLo¢).","[532, 533]"

lost, in the same way that the apocopated form of the adverbial

not occur in monomorphemic words in Koasati.

the functional equivalent of a verb phrase followed by the switchreference marker -n and the verb hdzlon ‘to hear.’ It does not have

"Conjunctive WordsKoasati has a plethora of conjunctive words, which are used
primarily in discourse, at the beginning of sentences, These words
relate the actions of the previous sentence to the following sentence
in terms of sequence, dependence, and causality. Additionally,
nearly all are marked with switch-reference markers indicating
whether the following sentence has the same or a different subject
than the previous sentence.
Although conjunctive words are numerous, there are only three
roots: mammin, akkammin, and *ma. The verb mdammin is used
independently with the meaning ‘to occur by chance, to happen’; it
contrasts with the verb mayé:ban ‘to occur by a fortunate chance.’form often occurs, especially in the speech of the young. It is likelythat in the future the form akkd:min will be generalized for use in

frequently occurring suffixes in the language. It indicates that thespeaker has knowledge of the action only through the words of
others. It may describe either second-hand knowledge or first-handknowledge being reported to another. In the latter case, -mpa- is
used to incorporate quoted speech into an utterance, as in the{ taétwamp/‘He, says that he, sings.’SING-Iss-hearsaytilwa-li-mpDue to the distinctive énkak-ké:han frame for most Koasati quoted

“He says that I sing.’The above example shows the difficulty of applying transformationaltheory to Koasati. On a deep level, the énkak-kd:han frame has tobe equivalent to -mpa-, yet that suffix has no phonological or
morphological similarity to the frame. This theory also does not
take into account that if the subject of the verb encompassed by theframe is in the second person, then in order for the suffix -mpa- tooperate correctly, the verb must be transformed from a second
person form to a first person form, if the addressee is the one who

"The Switch-Reference Markersthe same or a different subject from the following clause. The basicKoasati, like other Muskogean languages, has a system of switchreference marking that indicates whether the subject of a clause hasreferred to:-ok for samesubjectforms of the switch-reference markers-are -k for a clause with an
identical following subject and -n for a clause with a different
following subject. These suffixes have forms with greater emphasis,reference and -on for different subject (see Nicklas, 1972:211 foror focus, as it is sometimesthey were unitary nominal or nominalizing morphemes that havedetails of a parallel system in Choctaw). In addition, the switchreference marker -p indicates that a new topic is being introduced
or that new information is being proferred. The switch-reference
suffixes are identical to the nominal case suffixes -k ‘nominative,’
-n ‘accusative,’ and -p ‘new topic.’ It seems likely that originallyexpression and a lack of the ambiguity that can occur in parallelbecome distinct from their distinctive uses.
Switch reference in Koasati is used to disambiguate actors in a
complex narrative, especially when there are two or more third
person subjects. This construction leads to a great economy ofkohté iyyi polt6kl aw4h cahappa:ka-n

from other items by means of the interrogative internal change, V7V

addition to the case suffixes, which indicate the function of a noun
in the sentence, there are suffixes that indicate that the noun has
been previously mentioned and also locate that noun in time. Still
other suffixes supplant the case suffixes and serve discourse rather
than sentence functions.
Case SuffixesThere are seven different cases in Koasati, but no noun occurswith more than six. The classical terminology for cases will be usedto name the cases of Koasati, but it must be understood that the
functions of these cases may not be, in all instances, their classical
ones. With this in mind, the following are the cases of Koasati:nominative, accusative, autonomous, locative, allative, inessive, and
vocative,Nouns fall into five categories, depending on the cases with whichthey are permitted to occur,
All nouns take the nominative,
accusative, and autonomous cases; of the remaining cases, somethe inessive; and another few take the vocative.nouns. take only the locative; others take the locative and allative;
still others take the locative, allative, and inessive; a few take onlyBefore the cases are individually described, it will be useful to
tabulate the five noun classes and the forms that the nouns take in
the various cases. These can be seen in the following table.

"Participles, which are derived by suffixation from verbs, are used
exactly like noun modifiers (adjectives), They follow the nouns they
modify and take the case suffixes that the noun phrase would take.
Additionally, the noun modified by the participle may have its
subject marking stripped, just asa noun modified by an adjective
may (see chap. 18). Participles have been noted primarily in
elicited speech; in texts, similar constructions are handled by joining
sentences with switch-reference markers.
Participles seem to
subordinate the action of their own clause to the action of the mainclause; in switch-reference marking, the action of both sentences isverb.","[307, 308]"

Class 3CiThis open class of verbs has only about one hundredmembers. Verbs derived from nouns by the use of internal changes
(see chap. 11) also belong to class 3Ci. The verbs basic to this class
