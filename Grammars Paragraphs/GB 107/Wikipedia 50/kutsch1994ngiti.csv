considered by the people as a subgroup of Pi, and probably points more to
an ethnic subdivision, since their speech forms are almost identical. [1 must

there are different processes by which nouns are derived from verbs (5.11.1).
Four morphological strategies are described, three of which are action-related.
The fourth strategy, tonally constrastive with one of the three action-related
strategies, marks the result of the action or an object related to the action,
Secondly, there is participant-noun formation (5.11.2). A distinction is madebetween participant nouns on the one hand, and agent nouns with expressed
abject. Two strategies of the former are described, and one of the latter,Finally, nominalisation processes take place in order to make the members of
a particular class of words take a nominal function in the sentence, In. thisway, modifiers, verbal modifiers, numerals, and postpositional phrases can benominalised. When nominalised, they may function in possessive constructions,
postpositional phrases, or as head of a subject or object noun phrase. All theseNounsconstituents undergo one and the same process of nominalisation, which is
described in’ 5.11.3.
§.11.1 VerbalThere are four strategies to derive non-participant nouns from verbs:
1. verb stems + -ta
2, verb stems on a M.H tone pattern
3. verb stems on a M.H tone pattern + -ngathe result of the action or an object related to the action of the verb.4, verb stems on other tone patterns

inalienable possessive constructions and verbal modifiers. Verb or clause
modification can also be expressed by means of postpositional phrases. All
three are briefly exemplified in the following sections.
9.2.2.1 Inalienable Possessive ConstructionInalienable nouns functioning as head of an inalienable possessive construction
may semantically serve to modify that noun, These inalienable nouns differ
from the regular modifiers in that they follow the noun they modify and that
they cannot undergo the process of nominalisation, since in themselves they
are already nominals (see also. 5.5.1).","[359, 360, 361, 362]"
