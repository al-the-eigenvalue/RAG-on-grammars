"Clauses Predicating ExistenceAnother subtype of intransitive clause, the existence clause, is also common in the texts. It
usually takes the same sort of posture verbs as the locative clause as predicates, but does not have any
locative object. Another difference from locative clauses (described in the section 6.4.2) is that the
negative form of existence clause is always verbless, and it is possible to omit the verb in some
positive existence clauses as well. Verbal clauses are negated using the verbal negative particle ake
(see example 7d), but in a negated existence clause the nominal negative word kalpis is used instead,
and the verb is missing.(7a)(7b)(7c)(7d)Men

only(Here the first clause is negative and verbless. Second clause has werpm as subject and rmpa as
predicate.)The existence clause often has the same thematic functions as certain left dislocations in Urim and
the existential clause in English; it is used to introduce new items to the text. This explains also why
the subject in this clause type can move so easily after the verb. The position after the verb is
universally the place of new information in the clause, and in existential clauses the subject usually is158
new information, while in other clause types it is usually given information. The following examples
illustrate how existence clauses and left dislocation are used the same way to introduce main
participants at the beginning of a text. They also show how difficult it is sometimes to tell the
difference between left dislocation and existence clause.

"Experience ClauseThe topic of an experience clause is also always animate and semantically an experiencer. The
grammatical subject is usually either a body part, where the feeling etc. is located, or an inanimate
referent which is the cause of the feeling or the object of wanting etc. The only common features
such clauses exhibit are: 1) the semantic meaning of involuntary experience, and 2) the presence of an
obligatory topic constituent before the grammatical subject. Most experience clauses have a bound
object pronoun which is coreferential with the topic (24a), (24d), but this pronoun can be absent,
especially if the grammatical subject is a body part of the experiencer (24b), (24c).
The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are
always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is
specific (see section 3.1.4).

different meaning (perhaps having to do with scope of negation) than those negated with kalpis.",[168]
"NegationThere are two basic negators in Urim: ake ‘not’ (for verbal clauses) and kalpis (for non-verbal
clauses) (=Kukwo dialect kalpm) ‘no’. Instead of kalpis the more injection-like a’a can also be used.
The verbal negator ake can occur either immediately before or after the subject (more usual in
texts), but if the subject is prominent and therefore fronted, then ake always occurs between it and the
verb. Ake is also used in verbless equative and descriptive clauses.

Kalpis is used to negate non-verbal existence and possessive clauses, occurring at the end of the
clause. It frequently takes the attributive suffix -en. Kalpis (or sometimes a’a) is also used to answer
yes/no questions and at the end of the clause to strengthen the ake negation of the clause.

"168
The possessive clause is negated differently from most other clause types. Instead of the usual
negative particle ake the nominal negative word kalpis is used and there is no verb.10 Elsewhere,
only existence clauses are negated in this way (see Section 6.3.2). There are two other features shared
between existence clauses and possessive clauses: 1) use of the same verbs, and 2) the existence of
verbless variants. It might be possible to derive some types of possessive clause from an existence
clause or a locative clause by adding a topic, but the structure is fully grammaticalized and the topic is
obligatory.","[167, 168]"

1sgNon-serialized clauses conjoined without any overt conjunctionIt is quite common in Urim to simply juxtapose coordinated, non-serialized clauses without any
overt conjunction. Juxtaposed, non-serialized clauses are distinguished from verb serialization
constructions by intonation. Pauses usually occur between coordinated clauses, never in
serializations. Often there is rising intonation on the last word of each non-final coordinated clause,
especially in lists. In lists, juxtaposition of the conjuncts is the norm:
Tu
kai nangnang, howen nim, antokg kweikwei
kol-pa, tu atopen.
3pl go singsing beat drum do.R
things
like-that 3pl rejoice.R
‘They go to singsings, beat drums, do things like that, they get joy (from those things)’
When a second clause/sentence is a paraphrase of the first, it is typically just juxtaposed.

Ari is the most common contrastive conjunction. Its function is to mark contrast or
contraexpectation. Typically there is an unexpected event or sudden (especially negative) surprise,
sometimes just some new turn of story. Sometimes ari just marks the change of actor or speaker in
discussion, especially if the speaker answers negatively or otherwise against expectations.

texts to indicate a turning point of a story.

Ari seems to be used more often when the clause expresses some new incident that hinders the
plan, while pake is used more often when the hindering element already exists or is known (like the
price of a car). This is just a tendency, not a rule. The uses of these conjunctions seem to overlap at
least partly.
This far it seems that only pake occurs in following cases:
1) When the two clauses express contrastive comparison, either in quantity or in quality or on
positive-negative.

sentence or particular noun phrases. In the available corpus of texts, the emphatic particle function of
pake is much more common than its conjunctive function. Emphatic pake is especially common in
narrative texts and conversations, while the conjunction pake is comparatively rare in narrative text.
When pake has scope over the whole sentence, it usually occurs last in the sentence, and therefore is
not easily confused with the conjunction pake.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"
"Monotransitive ClausesThe characteristic of this clause type is that it has an obligatory direct object with the usual
semantic role of affected patient or patient-of-result. Unlike locative objects, this object can be easily
fronted for thematic purposes.. The verb in this clause can either be a non-derived transitive verb or a
transitive verb derived by a transitivizer suffix.
The semantic role of the transitive subject is almost exclusively that of agent. This means that
usually only animate referents occur as subjects of transitive clauses. Agents are prototypically
animate, volitional and active causes of an action. In Urim forces of nature and moving machines can
also frequently occur as transitive subjects. When other, less prototypical kinds of inanimate entities
occur as transitive subjects there are usually some morphological changes in the clause: the ultimate
agent occurs as clause topic at the beginning (16b), or an instrumental serialization with the verb ak
’do’ is used(16a).8

cut.R -2sg.O‘Mowal (accidentally) cut himself with an axe.’In example (16b) the actor hurts himself accidentally. In this case the instrument usually appears

A number of examples are now given of normal transitive clauses with clause initial subjects
bearing the semantic role of agent. Transitive clauses can also have an optional indirect object, which
is usually marked by the preposition eng or the affix -n on the verb (underlined).

clauses. There are relatively few verbs that require three obligatory arguments. The semantic role of
the third argument can be benefactive or recipient and sometimes also locative or instrumental. The
ditransitive subtype is here defined purely on a structural basis. Optional benefactives etc. are almost
always marked by the preposition eng, which is reduced into a suffix -n occurring between the verb
and direct object, if the direct object is a personal pronoun (17d), (17e). Obligatory benefactives etc.
are morphologically unmarked.
In some cases the border between obligatory and optional third argument is not clear
morphologically. If the verb already has a suffix -en, there will be no other suffix -n as the result of
dative shift (17 f). Certain verbs behave sometimes like ditransitive verbs, sometimes like monotransitives; compare examples (18c) and (18d). The example (18d) is monotransitive since the
locative phrase kai ampei cannot occur without the preposition. This shows the same kind of
phenomena of gradual transitivity that was discussed earlier in the section 2.

The nominal clause consists of two nominal phrases or a nominal phrase and an adjective phrase.
No overt copula occurs linking the subject/topic noun phrase and the nominal or adjectival predicate.
There are two types of nominal clauses: equative and descriptive.
A negative nominal clause is formed by the verbal negation word ake (22e) even if there is no
verbal predicate. This distinguishes the nominal clause from the possessive clause, which sometimes
looks similar (23d).","[162, 163, 164]"

The indefinite quantifier ur is a good example of a word that has several word class functions. It
resembles indefinite articles occurring on many languages, and like these, is clearly related to the
numeral uris ‘one’. In Urim, the numeral uris morphologically looks like a attributive form of ur
(ur-is ‘ATR’).
The most common and probably basic function of ur is to mark indefiniteness ‘a, one’ (in
negative clauses ‘any’). Ur is commonly used to introduce new referents to the text, but not every
time. Ur is used in the following cases:
- when it is important to know the number of referents introduced, but the context or other
modifiers do not tell it. For this reason ur is almost always used when persons are introduced. Often
it can be glossed ‘one’ like the numeral uris, but the numeral does not have the function of
introducing new referents. Even if the numeral occurs, ur is still required to show that a new referent
is being introduced (see the first example below).

There are four demonstratives. Each of these can have both referential and psychological uses.
All can also be used to refer to time and as parts of pro-adverbs. The basic deictic functions of these
demonstratives are as follows:
ti
pa
aikil‘this, here’ indicates physical nearness to the speaker, to the hearer, or to both. It can also
indicate psychological nearness to the speaker.
‘that, there’ indicates a referent that is some distance away from the speaker, the hearer, or both.
The referent is usually near enough to be seen. Pa can also signal an indefinite distance.
‘far away, over there, somewhere’ is phonetically a clitic, but native speakers usually write it
separately. Ai indicates that a referent is relatively far away from both the speaker and hearer.
The referent is usually not near enough to be seen. Ai also often indicates an indefinite spatial
or temporal distance.
‘3sg; this, here’ marks physical or psychological nearness and is sometimes used instead of ti
when referring to humans or animals, or when the proximity of a referent is emphasized. Kil is
basically a third person singular pronoun with its use as demonstrative pronoun being secondary
(see section 2.4).","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"

DTime wordsSince Urim verbs have no tense morphology indicating time of occurrence, time is expressed with
time adverbs. These have been described earlier in the Section 2.7.1. In Urim, these words occur in
the clause independently of the verb, except perhaps the non-deictic sequencing adverbials hep ‘first,
ahead’ and katnukg ‘later, behind’: and the time adverb wet ‘now, recently, a short time ago’. These
are usually placed immediately before the main verb (or serials).","[146, 147]"
"The four functions of serial verb constructions in UrimSerial verb constructions have four functions in Urim. The first function is to encode a single
complex action or set of commonly co-occurring actions. Serial verbs can also serve as an abbreviated
way to express purpose and causation. The third function of serial verbs is more grammatical, for
example adding modal or aspectual meaning to a predication or marking peripheral semantic roles.
These kind of aspectual or modal verbs have historically developed into full clause particles or
prepositions and finally lost their verbal meanings altogether in other languages. The fourth function
of serial verb constructions in Urim is as a means of introducing new lexical items into the language.
All these types of serialization are very common in Urim.",[197]
"3.3. Linking of phrases
Additive Conjunction a
The most common device of coordinating phrases is the conjunction a ‘and’. This conjunction
homophonous with the genitive and relative marker a, but is not the same lexeme. Examples:
kiin

‘women and men’kipman
manwanukg a

Kupm a

1sg

and Layun and Melawor
‘I and Akalpm and Layun and Melawor...’143Coordinated phrases (and words) without any markers
Listing is usually done without any overt connecting conjunction. Also when there are multiple
coordinated modifiers of the head noun/noun complex with the noun phrase, no connectives conjoin
the modifiers:
kwei,
kimpa,
kimpa wasulu...
yam sp.
yam sp. sweet potato
‘Yams, mami-yams, [and] sweet potatoes’
Tu

wring

‘parents’
wusok-wail
small -big
‘brothers, sisters (of same sex)’
kiin -a -kipman (or: kiin-kipman)

‘people’Dual pronouns connecting NPs
When speaking about several people using their names, no conjunction usually occurs. Instead a
suitable personal pronoun occurs either before or after the names. The dual pronoun tuwekg ‘they144
two’ is usually reduced into (w)ekg ‘ two’. This pronoun can occur before, between, or after the two
NPs. When the connecting pronoun occurs before, the structure looks more like an appositional
construction :
Kinming

CAccompaniment linking
The verbs nampokgen ‘together with’ and anti ‘with’ are used when coordinative relation
between NPs has the additive meaning of accompaniment. These words could perhaps also be
interpreted as prepositions, especially since nampokgen does not occur as predicate. Both still exhibit
an irrealis form. Anti seems to occur only with human NPs, nampokgen can occur also with nonhuman NPs although it normally is used about humans. These conjunctions never occur between
clauses.

Some phrases are formed by adding the suffix –en to the modifier. The function of this suffix is
to mark the construction as a phrase, and it also has the semantical meaning ‘with’ (see also section
4.5.2.2). These phrases often function as adverbials in the sentence :

PERFDisjunctive nominal phrases

in questions. Here we only present some examples of it conjoining noun phrases. Other uses of aki
are described later in the section 5.5.3.

or3.4. What is Verb Phrase in Urim?
The term verb phrase is used in two senses. ‘Traditionally, it refers to a group of verbs which
together have the same syntactic function as a single verb (is coming, may be coming, get up to). In
such phrases, one verb is the main verb and the others are subordinate to it. In generative grammar,
the verb phrase has a much broader definition, being equivalent to the whole of the predicate of a
sentence’ (Crystal pp.325-326).
In this grammar the different types of predicates will be described later in the Chapter 4 ‘Urim
Basic Clause Types’. If we follow the traditional definition of verb phrase, most serial phrases do fit
the definition, but not all of them. Many serial verb phrases function syntactically as prepositions.
Negation and some modality could possibly be described as part of verb phrase, but the scope of most
modal particles is rather the whole clause or sentence than verb phrase. Therefore it might be better to
leave the whole term ‘verb phrase’ out of Urim grammar.. Serial structures have already been
described in the sections 3.2.7 and 3.3.6. The grammatical functions commonly expressed in
languages within verb phrases, like negation, modality and time, have been partly described earlier
(3.2.2.) but we will shortly discuss them here too.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"Modal AdverbsIn Urim most modal notions are encoded using modal verb + VP/S complement constructions, or
various serial constructions. One of the negative words explained in the previous section could be
analyzed as a modal verb; am(p)ur ‘don’t’.
There are also a few modal adverbs in Urim. Imperatives are encoded with a sentence final modal
adverb that is cliticized onto the last word of the sentence:
Kai
go
‘Go!’o!
IMPTepm
kaino
1pl.Inc
go.up
‘Let us go now!’om
IMP+nowPermissive imperative is encoded with repeating the predicate at the beginning of the sentence:
Kai
kitn
kai
o!
go
2sg
go
IMP
’You may go now!’ or ‘Okay, go now!’78Urim also has two modal adverbs that are used to encode probability; pilpa ‘perhaps, must be’ and
kol ‘possibly’. The word kol also has several other usages; therefore it will be described in more
detail in Section 5.6. It is commonly used in conditional or other clauses where the event or action is
less probable. It is not used when the condition is considered a fact or at least quite possible.
The modal adverb pilpa always occurs sentence initially. When it occurs after predicate, it has
the meaning ‘about, summarily’ (the third example below). Also kol usually occurs sentence
initially as modal adverb, but may also come between the subject and the verb, but has not found after
the predicate in modal meaning (see the last examples below).

"Experience clausesNP + NP + V (+Pron)T S V (O)About defining clause types
The following criteria have been used here to determine the basic clause types in Urim:
1) How many obligatory arguments does the verb have? This is the main criterion. The
presence or absence of a verb is often also used as the main criterion for dividing clauses
into types. While Urim has both verbal and nonverbal clause types, there are also some
minor types where the verb is optional or is deleted when negated. Therefore the presence
of the verb is only used as a secondary criterion in determining Urim basic clause types.
2) What are the syntactic functions (subject, object etc) and the semantic roles (agent,
patient etc) of the arguments of the verb?
3) Clause types may also have special syntactic features such as word order, negative
form, case morphology etc. These, along with the meaning of the clause, have been used
here only as secondary criteria in separating clause types.
The important notion of transitivity distinguishes the two most common basic clause types in any
language: intransitive and transitive clauses. There are degrees of transitivity in clauses, since the
notion of transitivity is a graded continuum (Givon 1984: 98, 152-157). In the prototypical, highly
transitive clause the subject referent is a volitional, controlling agent or a non-volitional cause/effector154
and the object is a concrete, result-registering effect or patient. Many objects are less than
prototypical
In Urim certain clause types have an intermediate degree of transitivity, and are therefore called
here semitransitive. Clearly transitive verb stems are not as common in Urim as in many other
languages. Many verbs can have both transitive (or semitransitive) and intransitive (or reflexive) uses
( 1a), (1b), with no morphologically marking to indicate a change in transitivity. In Urim transitive
verbs are often derived from intransitive ones via addition of the transitive suffixes -en or -e.3. These
suffixes can increase the transitivity of an intransitive verb or clause, making it transitive or
semitransitive (1a), (1c). They can also change semitransitive verbs into fully transitive verbs.

"The conjunction pa
The different functions of pa
The word pa is the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 35 texts containing over 28,000
words pa occurs about 355 times. This corpus contains mostly spoken texts but also some written
ones. Pa is somewhat less common in written texts. In some clauses the word pa occurs 4 times.
This is possible because of the many functions of this morpheme. The basic meaning of pa is far
deictic—‘there’. When it functions as a modifier within a noun phrase, pa usually marks givenness /
psychological accessibility of a referent to the hearer, but it can also function as a topic marker
following various sorts of topicalized or left-dislocated constituents indicating a new temporal setting,
a new or changed topic, or focus. As a phrasal head, pa can have following functions: deictic pronoun
‘that’, locative adverb ‘there’, emphatic particle, and conjunction.
In speech pa has certain phonetic features that help distinguish its various functions. As a
conjunction, pa is either preceded or followed by a pause. Native speakers are often unsure about
where to write the comma in written language. But in spoken language the differences of function
associated with pre- or post-pausal occurrence of pa are clearer. It is generally the case in the
language that whenever a conjunction occurs before a pause, it is pronounced with a distinctive rising
intonation and often its final vowel is also lengthened. This is true for pa as well.",[222]
"Time ClausesThere are two structurally peculiar types of clause that could be described as subtypes of the
intransitive clause. One of them, which is here called the time clause, consists of one element only;
a noun phrase denoting time of day. The reasons why these words are not considered lexical verbs
are: 1) these time words do not have any case frame with arguments, in other words, the time clause
never has any other obligatory elements except the time word itself, which functions both as the
subject and the predicate of the clause. 2) In Urim nouns and verbs do not usually have the same
morphological form in the lexicon (like English ‘love’ or ‘fish’ for example), although verbs and verb
phrases can easily be nominalized without any formal marking. 3) Another reason fro classifying time
words as nouns is that adjectives can be formed from them by the suffix –et. This is rare with verbs.
4) Aspectual, temporal, and modal particles can occur in this time clause the same way as in verbal
clauses. This is possible, because they do not belong to the verbal morphology but are clausal
particles.
Time words also resemble verbs semantically more closely than most other nouns, since the
points of time are not actually fixed units but processes. Normally nouns represent the most
permanent states, verbs the most rapidly changing states, and adjectives are somewhere in between
(Givon 1979a: 265-266).4
The time clause is fairly common in texts but is sometimes difficult to differentiate from
dislocations.(6a)Kong,

marker.",[156]

"4.7. Typological Considerations
In summary, some clear tendencies can be seen. First, SVO word order occurs in all clause types.
Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language. In particular, the position of subject is very fixed.
In most clause types it cannot be moved after the verb or anywhere else. In certain intransitive
clauses this is possible, but not very common. Also the position of locative object and topic is quite
rigid. In transitive clauses the second argument, object, is easily fronted for thematic reasons. There
is not so much danger of mixing the grammatical functions of subject and object in transitive clause,
because the transitive subject always is the more animate and agent-like referent in the clause. As
we have seen, the transitive subject is almost exclusively agent, and if not, this is shown by the
structure of the clause.
Typologically it is a common phenomenon that rigid word order and lack of morphological case
markings occur together in a language. This is especially common in SVO-languages like Urim.
Urim does not have any case marking morphology on either the subject or object, nor is there any
agreement marked on the verb either. Since there is no morphological way to mark which noun
phrase in the clause is subject and which is object, the syntactic position of the noun phrase before or
after the verb is what shows its syntactic function. Not only the subject and transitive object are
unmarked, but also all other obligatory arguments of a verb are morphologically unmarked. This
increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of NPs in the clause. The
following examples illustrate how a change of word order changes the meaning of clauses and even
the clause type:
(25a)Kupm
1sgwan
houseitna.
stand.R‘I have a house.’(25b)Kupm

(26b)Melnumalm -pel(experience clause)
nikg170
manhit.R-3sg.Ostomach‘The man hit him in the stomach.’(transitive clause)Urim has been classified as a Papuan language, stock level isolate in the Torricelli Phylum.. The
question of isolation can be re-considered when some of the neighbouring languages have been
studied in more detail. All Torricelli languages display some similarities with Austronesian
languages: fixed SVO word order, lack of medial verbs, use of transitivity-changing suffixes and
realis-irrealis mood, etc. It seems that Urim has these non-Papuan features to a greater extent than
many other Torricelli languages. It lacks subject-agreement on the verb, and is also in other respects
morphologically simpler than the other Torricelli phylum languages.
Torricelli phylum languages have been thought to be basically Papuan languages which have been
subjected to heavy Austronesian influence. There are some Austronesian languages along the north
coast. Word order is one of the Austronesian features in the Torricelli language group, since Papuan
languages usually are SOV- languages. It is a common theory that SVO- languages often have
developed from earlier SOV-languages either through the influence of some neighbouring SOVlanguages or from language internal reasons. One of these reasons could be the disappearance of
morphological case-marking, which in a way forces the language to rely on the word order in marking
these functions. (Givón 1979a 145-146). If a language were to change its word order from SOV to
SVO, it would be expected that there would be some residues from the former SOV-type structure.
The more recent this change has been, the more residues would be expected. Word order change
most commonly starts from the main-clause level, and later spreads into more complex structures.
According to Givón (1984:220-228). “the longer a language has maintained a rigid OV or VO word
order, the more it is likely to bear out Greenberg’s predictions (1966).” If this is true, then Urim has
been SVO-language at least during the last two thousand years, since it is an unusually pure SVOlanguage following all the predictions that Greenberg mentions. All modifiers of the noun phrase and
almost the entire verb phrase occur after the head. There are suffixes, but this is quite a common
feature in SVO-languages in general, and not a strong indicator of a recent change of word order.
Most commonly the residue of the presumed word order would occur in dependent and embedded
clauses and other structures like nominalizations and idioms. But in Urim these have SVO-word
order, except when the subject referent is generic:
(27)Kil
ariwe
hapm
3sg
know.R cloth
‘She knows how to sew.’angkut.
sew.RThis is the only observed possible residue of a former SOV-word order. Assuming this theory is
right Urim is an almost ideal SVO-language typologically. One could perhaps question if it were
easier to derive a language like Urim from an Austronesian group having some heavy Papuan171
influences than the other way around? But this and the whole question of the classification of Urim
needs much more work before any definite answers or even suggestions can be given.","[169, 170, 171]"
"Chart of Urim Basic Clause Types
NameConstituentsFunctions1 This chapter is an unpublished paper written 1991.
Many grammars talk about predication types instead of clause types, but we have chosen this traditional way of
structuralist grammars to describe these basic syntactic structures of Urim. Also the ideas of dependence grammar have
been used when describing Urim clause types.
2 Some languages allow basic clause types without any ‘proper’ semantic or grammatical subject. For example, in
Finnish the clause Sataa ‘It rains’ consists only of a verb without any semantic subject or subject NP on the surface,
although the verb has third person singular Subject indexing inflection.. The corresponding clause in English has a
semantically ‘empty’ subject it. In Urim these kinds of structures are not possible, unless the structure called here the
time clause is interpreted as having a verb instead of a noun as the only constituent (see section 4.7).",[152]
"‘Negative’ reason: atnen (a) ‘because of, fault of’The word atnen appears to be morphologically composed of the verb itna (atna) ‘stand’ and
transitive suffix -en. Like eng, it is basically a preposition. When a clause follows this preposition, a
relative clause marker (?) a is usually added after it (atnen a). This shows that all occurrences of
atnen should probably be analyzed as a preposition having either a NP or a nominalized clause as the
head. Semantically, atnen (a) usually refers to the reason for something bad happening.

There are still other types of subordinated clauses (for example conditionals), which could be

subordinated clauses, we will describe them with the other Urim conjunctions , in the following

treeComitative Serializations
Serialized constructions with the verbal preposition nampokgen ‘accompany’ are used to express
comitative notions. This word is fully grammaticalized to a preposition and is not used as a verb
anymore, but has retained realis-irrealis form. Its original meaning is not known and especially the
young people do not seem to connect the different realis and irrealis forms with mode, but use them
inconsistently. There are several freely alternating or dialect dependent forms of the word:
nampokgen (IR nimpokgen) and nampikgen (IR nimpikgen) in Urim 1 sub dialect, nampon (IR
nimpon) and nampiin(en) (IR nimpiin(en)) in sub dialect 2 and in Kukwo dialect. These can be used
when the accompanying party is either human or non human.
Serialized constructions with the verb anti (IR inti) ‘agree, comply with’ are only used if the
accompanying party is human. The verb ngkaten (IR ngkiten) ‘lift up with, carry with’ is used in
constructions expressing accompaniment when the object is actually physically carried.

somewhat negative meaning:

There are also two other serialized constructions containing the verb ak ‘do’, They are used to
express additional notions: aken ‘ to work with, add into’ (ak-en ‘do-with/TR’) and aklanti ‘in

Adjectives are defined as forms that can serve as either: 1) attributive modifiers of nouns within
the noun phrase, occurring immediately after the head noun and before all other modifiers, or 2) as
predicates. When adjectives occur as predicates, they never exhibit a realis-irrealis distinction. In
Urim, it is not usually possible for an adjective to occur in isolation as the head of the noun phrase,
except in elliptical contexts.

It is common in Urim for words to exhibit more than one syntactic function without any change in
form to mark the change in category, much like in English e.g. the word fish can function both as a
noun and a verb. This is especially true with the words that can function as modifiers of noun phrases
or as predicates. Very often the same word functions both as adjective and adverb in Urim without
any morphological change, for example such common words as paipm ‘bad; badly’ or wor ‘good;
well’.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

DAbout the uses of pa occurring before pause
Most Urim conjunctions can occur in two phonological positions, either before a pause
intervening between two clauses or after it. When a conjunction occurs before the pause, it is always
pronounced with a distinctive rising intonation, and often its final vowel, or syllable (also the final
nasal can be lengthened!) is lengthened as well. The placing of a conjunction before pause does not
basically change its meaning, but makes it more emphatic, for example expressing surprise. Quite
often prepausal pa is subordinating, with the potential for being interpreted as ‘when’, ‘because’, or
‘if’. In Urim pa conjunction occurring before a pause can have a causative, conditional, or temporal226
interpretation. Possibly there is no clear-cut difference between causatives and conditionals in Urim,
as far as the use of pa goes. When the speaker wants to express that the reason etc. is uncertain or
hypothetical, he adds irrealis mood and/or the particle kol to the clause.
Conditional clauses are clauses whose semantic role is the expression of hypotheses or conditions
(Crystal 1980). There are some similarities between topics and conditionals. In many languages both
may be marked by similar morphemes. This is also true in Urim - one of the main functions of pa is
to mark topicalized constituents.
The conjunction pipa is more common in conditional constructions than pa, especially in written
texts (see section 5. 5. 6. 4).
Examples:
Also a presuppositional pa occurring before the pause can be used purely in the meaning ‘when’
or ‘then’ - without any kind of clear causativity, like in the following examples:

Ti is basically a demonstrative indicating proximity: ‘this’, ‘here’. As a conjunction, it is used to
link clauses exhibiting a causal relationship. Often ti preserves it’s meaning of proximity when used
as conjunction, indicating that something which has just happened is the reason for something else
happening.
The conjunction ti tends to occur instead of pa in spoken conversations and direct quotations
when clauses exhibit a reason-result relationship..It does not have the other functions that the
conjunction pa has. So it is not used to mark temporal relationships, neutral/logical coordination, or
conditions.

following examples are from conversations, expressing reactions to present situations or

been said or has just happened, or to a present condition:

Urim is a non-Austronesian language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Laycock (1973) classifies it as a
stock-level isolate of the Torricelli Phylum. It is spoken by about 3400 people, who live in 16 villages
in the southern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains. Twelve of the villages are located south of the
Sepic Highway, and one is north of the highway, in the Maprik Sub-District of East Sepik Province. The
remaining three of the villages are located west of the Bongos River in the Nuku Sub-District of the
West Sepik Province. The villages west of the Bongos River speak the Kukwo dialect, and the villages
east of the Bongos River speak the main Urim dialect (also called Yangkolen by the Kukwo people).
The Urim language has also been called Kalp, which comes from the word kalpm ‘no’ in the Kukwo
dialect.
Earlier linguistic work on Urim was done by Glasgow and Loving (1964) and D.C. Laycock (1966 and
1973). The authors entered the area in 1979 under the auspices ot the Summer Institute of Linguistics
The data for this paper were collected mainly between 1980 – 1995 in the village of Laningwap. The
data includes a corpus of about 40 spoken and written texts along with some elicited material. The team
participated in a grammar analysis seminar at the S.I.L. center in Ukarumpa in 1981. Their consultants
were Robert Bugenhagen and Robert Conrad. Pirkko Luoma participated in a second grammar analysis
seminar in 1993 and was greatly helped by her consultant Robert Bugenhagen. Paul Heinemann also
provided many valuable suggestions and helped with the formatting of the paper.
This grammar consists of three parts that have been written independently from each other. The first
part, chapters 1 to 3, was written by Pirkko Luoma with some additions by Ritva Hemmilä. Chapter 4 is
an unpublished article written by Ritva Hemmilä in 1984. Chapters 5 and 6 were written by Ritva
Hemmilä with some corrections and additions by Pirkko Luoma.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"
"108b) Morphophonemic rules.
Many morphophonemic rules apply over word boundaries both in compound words and in
phrases. Those rules that apply only inside a word, actually are often restricted to the stem or to the
stem with suffixes, and do not apply between words in compound construction.
- Rule 10 (the rule that converts any vowel that is not followed by a more close vowel to a schwa)
operates almost exclusively inside the morpheme, not inside the phonological word. It can be applied
also to words derived by reduplication, but usually only when these words are so lexicalized that the
parts are not recognizable and do not occur alone anymore. In most words formed by reduplication
this rule is not applied, even if the constructions are clearly words phonologically, lexically and
grammatically:
Rule 10 applied:
milmal[m∂l’ml]‘thunder’kirkar[k∂r’kr]‘shout’pipa[p∂’p:]‘if’[kwlkwl]‘wail’Rule 10 not applied:
kwalkwalkarngkarng [krkr]
warwar‘corn husk’[wrwr]‘shake’- Rule 7a (palatalization) usually operates only inside the phonological word. It is applied when a
suffix is added to the word or between the parts of a compound or phrase, but not over word
boundaries except sometimes in rapid speech.

‘bring it up here’
- Rule 8 marks the boundaries of grammatical word quite clearly since it is not applied unless the
two words under a single intonation contour form a compound:
[mnzn]mansan‘parents’/wan##yun/ [wnyun]wanyun‘door’/man#yan/
but:compare:
wan
housewail
bigyun
door‘the door of a big house’c) Phonemic and phonetic restrictions:
- /pm/, /k /tn/ never occur word or morpheme initially
- // never occurs word or morpheme initially
There are also restrictions in the consonant clusters that occur word/morpheme initially or finally,
compared to the clusters allowed morpheme medially. Inside reduplicated and compound words, a
much larger set of clusters is allowed than inside morphemes.
mel-num
body-skin‘person’muikg-muin
sister-brother‘siblings’The clusters ln and kgm never occur morpheme initially.
Conclusion:
It seems that in Urim morpheme or root boundaries are more clearly marked than actual word
boundaries. Especially the restrictions of consonant clusters and the operation of the schwa-rule mark
morpheme boundaries. There are boundary marks for word too, but some of them mark both words
and phonological phrases (stress) some only words (rule 8) so that the whole concept of word is
somewhat vague in the language. This makes it difficult to determine exactly which expressions are
compounds, which should be called noun complexes. This reflects in orthography, too. Native
speakers tend to write as one word also those expressions that are grammatically clearly two words
(wanyun etc.). From the other hand, enclitics are usually written separately from the stem (anong ai ‘
to the village’) even when they are pronounced as one phonological word.","[107, 108, 109]"
"About Application of RulesMany rules, especially the schwa-rule (rule 10) but also most consonant insertion rules (rules 1, 2)
and the palatalization rule (rule 7) are conditioned by stress so that they either occur only in
unstressed syllables (schwa-rule) or in or after stressed syllables (consonant insertions).
Assimilation rules 7 and 8 and dissimilation rules 9 and 10 apply only inside a phonological word
(except rule 7 b: t --> ts change after palatalization, which can occur over word boundaries). These
rules serve to help in recognizing the phonological word.
Insertion and deletion rules 1-6 apply frequently over word boundaries in phrases and also
elsewhere in rapid speech. The closer knit the structure is, the more regularly most of these rules
apply.
Examples of the application of rule 1.:
obligatory /num-et/
[numpet]

The following word classes are distinguished in the syntactic description of Urim:
1.

10.verbs
nouns
pro-forms
prepositions

quantifiers
adverbs
demonstratives
conjunctions
interjectionsThe remainder of this chapter will examine each of the word classes in more detail, describing
their syntactic characteristics and morphological structure.
It is typical of Urim words in all word classes, that the same phonological form may instance
multiple classes; for example functioning as a noun and a verb, or as an adjective and an adverb.
Some phonological forms exhibit even more than two word classes. In some cases one of the
functions is clearly primary and the other function(s) secondary (for example many verbs can function
as heads in noun phrases without any morphological marking to indicate a change in category). More
often it is impossible to tell which word class is primary for a phonological form; it is bi- or multicategorical.

Urim verbs are defined as forms having the following characteristics:
1. They may function as the main predicate in simple clauses

pick.R
‘He shot a pig and took some taro’wayu
taro2. They exhibit ablaut alternations for irrealis versus realis modality. Approximately two thirds of
the verbs exhibit this property. But all onomatopoetic and descriptive verbs and also many directional
verbs fail to exhibit this property: no irrealis forms of these verbs have been observed. One possible
reason for this might be that these types of verbs in Urim tend to occur together with other verbs (in
serial structures, etc.) rather than alone. To express modality several times in the same clause would
be unnecessary.

the same lexical form can function either as verb or as noun. 2) Certain verbs have been
grammaticalized into prepositions. 3) The distinction between adjectives and stative verbs is not clear
in Urim. Many stative verbs may also function as adjectives in noun phrases, with no derivational
morphology to indicate a change in syntactic category.
4. Due to the realis/irrealis distinction, verbs as group also have some phonetic characteristics. A
large percentage of verbs begin with the vowel a (realis) or i (irrealis). Most Urim words beginning22
with the vowel /a/ are verbs. Verb roots usually consist of one or two syllables, with longer roots
being comparatively rare.
Morphologically, Urim verbs are simple in structure, not exhibiting any inflection for person or
number.2 The most important morphological category marked on verbs is a modal one. There is a
distinction of realis/irrealis mode that is indicated by the vowels i ‘irrealis’ and a ‘realis’. The
placement of these two vowels varies quite a bit depending on the canonical shape of the verb, but
usually they occur on the first syllable of the verb stem.
Aspectually, there is a habitual aspect suffix -e, and the use of reduplication of the verb stem to
express repeated or continued action. Most aspects in Urim are expressed by serial structures or
aspectual adverbs.
Two or three types of transitivity altering suffixes are also observed: 1) the transitivising suffix en , 2) the indirect object marker –n,which is possibly related to -en, and 3) the suffix -e which seems
to have both aspectual and transitivity changing functions. Forms homophonic with the suffixes -en
and -e are also used derivationally.
The overall order of constituents in the Urim verb is:
verb root (Habitual-Continuative -e) (Transitive -en) (IO-marker -n) (Object Pronominal Clitic)
In Urim a verb stem can be simple, reduplicated, compound, or consist of a root morpheme plus a
derivational affix (sometimes more than one) (see the section 2.12.3).","[19, 20, 21, 22]"
"Serial structuresSerial structures are formally of four types: coordinated, subordinated with main verb last,
subordinated with main verb first, and preposition-like serials. The functions of serial structures are
very various.
It is common to juxtapose several verbs together in Urim with no intervening conjunctions. In
some cases, the meaning of the combination is quite transparent, whereas in others it is more
opaque/idiomatic.

‘(They) brought (it) down and we roasted and ate’
Verbs expressing the manner of action usually occur before the semantically main verb in the verb
phrase. Normally no other constituents occur between the manner verb and the predicate following
it.

Most verbs indicating aspects also occur preceding the predicate they semantically modify,
forming a verb phrase with it.

others, but the verbal modal distinction of realis-irrealis is always present.

fire4. Urim Basic Clause Types
4.1. Introduction and Chart of Clause Types
The clause is the basic syntactic unit occurring between the phrase and the sentence.1 When
describing the clauses of a language, it is important to clearly distinguish between the notions of text
clause and basic or kernel clause. Text clauses consist of both nuclear and peripheral elements, and
quite often some of the nuclear elements are not present in the clause if they are known from the
textual context or environmental context or are part of the semantic content of the verb. A basic
clause consists of nuclear elements only and is a ‘perfect’ or ‘full’ clause in the sense that it does not
have any elided constituents and it can be understood without a text context. Generative grammar
defines kernel clauses or sentences as being minimal in the sense that they cannot be derived from
other clauses. This excludes passive, imperative, interrogative etc. types from basic clause types.
(Lyons 1979, Givon 1984)
Nuclear elements of the clause are the predicate, which is usually a verb, and its obligatory or core
arguments. In nonverbal clauses the NP or adjective phrase functions as the predicate. In Urim a
clause can minimally consist of only a single predicative noun phrase. Basic clauses consisting only
of a verb are not allowed2, although this kind of text clause is very common as the result of ellipsis
and clause chaining. All clauses can also have various types of optional adjuncts: accompaniment,
instrument, time, location, reason, etc. In Urim the number of optional elements in a clause is usually
restricted to at most two. The occurrence of these is semantically determined, and does not affect the
description of the basic clause types.","[150, 151, 152]"

Imperative modus is in Urim optionally expressed by using the clause-final imperative clitic –o.
In imperative clause the verb or verbs are always in irrealis mode. Sometimes this clitic occurs in the
form –om, which adds the meaning ‘now’ (possibly shortened from am ’now’). Imperative clitic is
always attached to the last word of the clause or sentence:

As the examples above show, in imperative clauses the subject may or may not appear on the
surface. Reason is pragmatical, since Urim verbs do not encode person or plurality.
Following examples show that the clitic –o appears only once in the sentence:

other examples have been found this far) at the beginning of the clause. In this type of imperative the
personal pronoun is obligatory::

"Introducing new participants and referents to discourseIn Urim new participants and referents are introduced by various means: full NP, full NP plus
relative clause, full NP plus indefinite ur, full NP plus the demonstrative pa, full NP plus a
combination of ur and pa. In addition, there are also special clause and phrase types, which are used
for introducing new participants.
New items that are not topical, are usually introduced by a full noun phrase, with or without the
indefinite quantifier ur. Ur is not used if it is clear from the context that there can be only one
referent:

There are different ways to introduce topical new referents. Left dislocations and special
presentative constructions are used. This is especially the case at the beginning of texts, but also
happens sometimes at the beginning of a new paragraph.. When new main participants are introduced
in a narrative text, very often the combination of ur pa is used (with or without left dislocation). Here
the indefinite ur expresses that the participant is new information, while the demonstrative pa marks
the referent of the NP as topical. If the identity of the new participant is further specified by a
relative clause, pa is not used:

demonstratives , regardless of whether or not they are topical. When the introduced participants are
inherently definite NPs like pronouns or proper nouns, the beginning of a story is often marked by
adding pa or ur pa to a sentence-initial time adverbial.

If the new participant or other topic is introduced using special presentative clauses like the
following, no deictic particles are used:

In the last example the theme or name of this traditional story is mentioned in the presentative
clause, and the main actor is marked as topical via use of ur pa.
New important participants can also be introduced by using just pa. This commonly happens in
traditional narratives, where the participants are already familiar to the hearers:

personIn case the new referents are not topical, i.e. they will not be recurringly referred to in the text,
they are often modified by an embedded locative clause when first introduced, as in the following two
examples.

go upThere is universal tendency in languages to avoid having new information introduced into the text
in Subject position (Givon 1979a :72-74). In Urim, however, it is possible to have Subjects introducing new information, but often left-dislocations, existence clauses or topic structures are used to
avoid this. Only topical, important items are introduced to the text in subject position. Less important
items are usually introduced in the typical position of new information after the verb. In Urim this NP
introducing new information quite often has an embedded locative clause as a constituent. Some of
these are lexicalized into deictic adverbials, like the expression ha-pa in the examples above.","[247, 248, 249]"

Urim also has two modal adverbs that are used to encode probability; pilpa ‘perhaps, must be’ and
kol ‘possibly’. Both occur sentence initially, and hardly can be considered part of a verb phrase. The
word kol also has several other usages; therefore it will be described in more detail in Section 5.6.
Pilpa has been described earlier in Section 3.2.2.","[149, 150]"

onlyComparison of AdjectivesIn Urim, there is no morphological means of expressing degrees of properties. Instead, various
phrasal constructions are used. A common device is the addition of a form identical to the adjective
paipm ‘bad’ after the adjective to express ‘very’. Frequently, the form namput ‘mention’ is also
interposed between the adjective and paipm. When namput paipm is not preceded by an adjective, it
has the meaning ‘very good’. With adjectives, however, it strengthens the goodness of the property
they encode. Sometimes also the word maur ‘spirit’ or the expression maur alkil is used in the same
meaning. This expression can also be used with adverbs.

Some adjectives have their own special intensifiers. For example, the word manten (< man
‘main, principal, major’) is used after the adjective wail ‘big’ to express hugeness. In the same way
the word mileng ‘very’ is used with the adjective watin ‘long’; watin mileng ‘very long’.",[66]
"Aspectual Adverbs and Other Aspectual ConstructionsUrim has several means to express aspectual notions. Although aspect is not usually expressed
by verb morphology, the suffix -e, which usually encodes transitivity, seems at least with some verbs
also express continuing action. Some aspects are expressed by serial verb constructions (Section 5.4)
The serial verb constructions expressing aspect differ from other serial constructions in that the
aspect marking verb occurs after the verb it semantically modifies.. In other serial constructions the
modifying verb usually occurs before the main verb. This formal difference probably means that the
serial verbs expressing aspect have been more or less grammaticalized into adverbs.
The most important and most adverb-like of these verbs is plalng ‘be finished, over’. It is used to
express completive aspect. Plalng occurs clause finally or before clause final function words like ise,
pa or imperative o. Plalng also occurs together with conjunctions pa, pipa (or rare form pilpa),
expressing consequal happenings (after completing this, he will do that) (see the section 5.5.7). As
an aspect marker plalng can also be followed by another aspect marker ise.

There are also some other aspect marking verbs that occur in the clause final position, but they are
more clearly serial verbs and are therefore described in Section 3.3.6. ‘Serial Structures’.
The most common and important aspectual adverb is ise (ase in Kukwo dialect and western
villages of Yangkolen, ike in eastern villages of Yangkolen). This adverb always occurs clause
finally. Ise is a very common word in Urim and expresses usually that the action or process has been
completed and that the described state is valid at the time of speaking. Therefore it often can be
translated ‘already’. With process verbs ise points to the final result or goal of process. For these
reasons ise can be called a perfective marker in Urim (see Comrie). Since completed action is
usually past action, ise also expresses general past and often finality as well.

D die.IR PERF
‘I connected the electric cord, and I could have killed that man!’81
The last example shows that ise can also be used in a clause having irrealis modality to denote
finality of action. (The word amo means either ‘be sick’ or ‘die’). Ise can also occur in clauses
having future tense; in these cases it’s meaning is less aspectual. In the following example ise
expresses intensity of the wish.
Kupm a

ampen

PERFOr

PERFIn the available data ise seems to occur only sentence finally, while the verb plalng which also

then’ (see the section 5.5.7).

The notion ‘about to’ is expressed by the expression eng a, which occurs before the verb and the
verb is in irrealis mode. Often eng a is preceded by wreren ‘close to’. Eng a can also be used with
plalng to express that the action is about to be completed.

Quantifiers occur in the noun phrase after adjectives encoding quality and before relative clauses
(which includes genitives) and demonstratives. Quantifiers can be subdivided into: 1) numerals, and
2) non-numeric quantifiers.","[79, 80, 81, 82]"
"4.3. Semitransitive Clauses
In many languages clauses having motion or locative verbs and locative adverbials are classified
as intransitive. Here these clauses are called semitransitive since they are semantically and
syntactically somewhere between transitive and intransitive clauses. The word order and functional
structure of semitransitive clauses is very much like that of transitive clauses in Urim. Both have two
obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb.
Dependency grammar classifies these verbs as two-place predicates since the location or goal can
be considered semantically obligatory with verbs like ‘arrive’ or ‘be situated’. For this reason the
goal or location in these clauses is often called locative object.(Givon 1984: 110, Lyons 1977:496) In
Urim there are no morphological differences between direct objects of transitive clauses and locative
objects; both are morphologically unmarked and always occur immediately following the verb.
Optional locative arguments of the verb are marked by prepositions. The only syntactical difference159
between direct objects and locative objects is that direct objects can be fronted while no fronting of
locative objects has been found in our data.
The ‘less transitive’ status of these clauses is reflected also in the use of transitive suffixes. The
same suffix -en which can change intransitive verbs or clauses into transitive or semitransitive ones
can also change semitransitive verbs into transitive ones. Actually deriving transitive verbs from
semi-transitive ones is much more common in Urim than deriving transitive verbs from intransitive
ones. Compare the following examples (10a,b) with examples (1a,b).
(10a)Kil
rpma
kanokg.
he
sit.R
ground
‘He sits on the ground.’(10b)Kil
arpm -en kar.
he
sit.R - TR car
‘He is waiting for the car.’Semitransitive clauses are here divided into three subtypes: locative clauses, directional clauses,
and resultative clauses. The basic structure of these clause types is the same, but they differ in
meaning, in respect to what semantic role the locative object has, and what verbs can function as
predicates.","[158, 159]"
"Possessive ClauseIn the possessive clause the semantic possessor occurs in topic position and the possessed item
occurs as grammatical subject. This is thematically consistent with the normal ordering of
information in the clause, since the referent of the possessor is usually given information, and the
thing possessed is new information. Since there is no agreement morphology on the verb to show
which NP is the grammatical subject, only word order and semantic content reveal it. The word order
seems to be fixed; the topic and the subject cannot change places in the clause. One example was
found where the subject appeared to occur between the two parts of an appositional topic noun phrase
(23e). The possessor is usually animate, and most often human. Possessive clause may have a verb
denoting the position of the possessed object. There are both verbal and verbless possessive clauses,
but positive possessive clauses are more frequently verbal. The verb seems to be obligatory if there
is another nominal constituent in the clause. Possessive clauses structurally resemble three other
clause types: equative clauses (23b), existence clauses (23e) and locative clauses (23a).

bigThe Near Demonstrative tiThe demonstrative pronoun ti ‘this, here’ always signals proximity to the speaker or hearer.
When ti occurs in texts, the nearness can also be psychological. This demonstrative pronoun can
have almost same discourse functions as pa has (givenness, contrast etc.) but concrete or
psychological meaning of nearness is always present in all uses (see the paper ‘The Demonstrative
Pronouns pa and ti in Urim Discourse). Ti is also used as conjunction (see section 5.5.6).
Following are examples of the occurrence of of ti as a locative adverb, a demonstrative pronoun,
and as a demonstrative modifier within the noun phrase:

"6. About Urim Discourse
6.1. Word Order Variations and Dislocations
Word order in Urim is basically very rigid. Since there are hardly any morphological means to
distinguish core arguments like Subject, Object, Locative Object and Second Object, they are solely
marked by their position. For this reason the core constituents cannot move very freely in the clause
for thematic reasons. Subjects almost always occur before the verb in Urim clause. Objects can be
fronted, but this is still comparatively rare in Urim.
Dislocations and topic constructions instead are very common in Urim. In these constructions the
topicalized or emphasized constituent occurs separately in front of the actual sentence, which relates
to it in some way. In most cases the external topic corresponds to some NP constituent in the clause
in which the external topic has some function. In left dislocation there is a grammatical element in the243
clause (usually a pronoun), which refers to the same entity. In topic constructions this does not occur
(Shopen p. 355).","[242, 243]"
"The far demonstrative paThe word pa is by far the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 28,000 words, pa occurs over
3,500 times. About half of these are conjunctive uses of pa. In spoken Urim, intonation often helps
to distinguish the different functions of pa. When pa is used as conjunction, it tends to be longer and
more stressed than when it is a noun phrase constituent (see also section 5.5.6).
The following examples illustrate the use of pa as a demonstrative pronoun:
Waring
ti,
yikal pa

bow that
‘The betel nut is here, the bow palm is there’

OBL say take.IR mouth other-other
but
pa

paipm
that
difficult
bad
‘I would like to learn many kinds of languages, but it is very difficult.’91
Because of its many functions at discourse level the purely demonstrative function of pa is
somewhat restricted in Urim. It can freely occur as independent demonstrative pronoun in most
positions, like the examples above show, but does not often occur as the subject of transitive or
intransitive clauses. The reason is probably that an independent word pa starting a clause could
easily be interpreted as a conjunction. Also it seems, that pa occurring as locative object would be
easily interpreted as emphatic particle. For this reason a deictic adverb is used instead. Compare the
following examples:
Mentekg

thereela
be.Rpa
thereThis last example was elicited. The native speaker did not accept the expression wayu pa in this
clause, possibly because the clause was not part of any context or text. When pa is used with NP, it
almost always marks givenness (refers back to something mentioned in the text or known from the
context) and the demonstrative meaning is bleached. Therefore different combinations of verb + pa
are used instead to make it clear that the speaker refers to location, not to givenness.
Examples of deictic and discourse functions of pa with NP:

crowdIn Urim compound verbs are quite common, but it is not always easy to tell whether two verbs
form a serial structure or a compound verb stem. Consider the following examples that show how a
verb phrase which is phonologically one word, can be grammatically a phrase (as we saw with nouns
in the section 1.5.1):
[‘:kw:p]kil
3sgak-kwap
do-work.Rkil
3sgak- n -opm [‘:ktopm]
do.R-TR-1sgO‘he works’kwap‘he works for me’
workSome idiomatic verb phrases containing ak are pronounced as two phonological words with more
than one main stress, others as one phonological phrase with one main stress. In both cases the
phrasal idiom is a single lexeme with a single, non-compositional meaning. No objects or other
constituents can be placed in between the parts of these idioms:
ak -won-alm-pen
do.R-inside-shoot-TR‘to think’ak -ok-la
do.R-mouth-say‘to beg’tu‘they are laughing at me’aknokg-el-opm113
theydo.R salt-3sg-1sgOCompounding with the verb ak ‘(use something to) do’ is a common means of expressing
causativity in Urim. Consider the following examples, which are phonologically one word but can be
interpreted as either lexemes or grammatical structures:

Urim also has compound adjectives and adverbs, although they are much less common than
compound nouns. Almost all numerals are formally compounds or complex phrases. Many personal
pronouns, especially dual and paucal forms are compounds. All this shows that compounding is a
very productive means of forming words in Urim.

In Urim reduplication is a very common morphological device; it has both derivational and
several different grammatical uses. In reduplication the word or stem is usually repeated once, in
some cases several times. Almost all word classes can be reduplicated: nouns, verbs, adjectives,
adverbs, quantifiers, etc.
The term reduplication refers to the copying of part (or all) of a stem and by this definition can
happen only inside a phonological word. The repetition of free forms (words) is not usually called
reduplication, but here both are described together. In Urim it is sometimes hard to tell, whether or
not a a repeated expression has been lexicalized. The whole process of lexicalization is a gradual
phenomenon, a continuum, where there are often border cases between full lexemes and phrases (see
Givon 1979 Ch.5). This is also reflected in the developing Urim writing system.
When new words are formed by reduplication, the two parts usually form one phonological word
and are written together. When the reduplication or repetition has grammatical functions, parts are
usually written separately, but may also be written together. The problem whether reduplicated
construction is one or two words can be compared to the similar problem with compounds (see
2.12.1).","[111, 112, 113, 114]"

"2.2.2. Reduplication of Verb Stems to Encode Imperfective Aspect: i.e,
Repeated, Continual, or Habitual Action
In Urim reduplication is a common morphological device in all word classes. It functions both
inflectionally and derivationally. Reduplication of verb stems is used to express imperfective aspect;
i.e. habitual, repetitive, or continuative/durative action. The exact type of aspect that reduplication
encodes depends partly on the semantic type of the verb. With punctiliar verbs reduplication encodes
repeated actions; topratopra ‘jump several times’. With verbs encoding more continuous motion
reduplication marks durativity; kai-kai-kai ‘keep on going’. With transitive verbs reduplication may
encode either habitual or durative aspects, but sometimes is also used to express added intensity.
When reduplication encodes habitual aspect, the verb stem is repeated only once, but in reduplications
expressing repetition or continuity/duration, the verb stem can be repeated several times depending
how much the speaker wants to emphasize the length of the action. Reduplicated verbs often occur
between two clauses expressing that the action continues until something else happens or until the end
of the process is reached.
Examples of habitual aspect:

example only the reciprocal pronoun is reduplicated (not the verb itself) to encode durative aspect:
Ekg
erkisen
tita
tita
two
persuade.R
REC
REC
‘They kept persuading each other.’
Reduplication is also a derivational device in Urim. Especially onomatopoetic and descriptive
verbs are often reduplicated stems.
klilngklulng ‘wriggle’
pingpong‘crack’There are also a few verbs derived from other verbs by reduplication:
ari‘see’compare to:
pirng2.2.3.‘run to’ariri‘watch’ari-ari ‘keep on looking, stare’
pirpir‘run’Imperfective Aspect Suffix -eThe suffix –e has both grammatical and derivational uses. It occurs in relative clauses when the
relative noun has the role of Locative Object within the relative clause, and serves to disambiquate the
relative clause from a chained clause. Since the principal function of this suffix is to express
continuity or habituliaty, it can only be used when the relative clause is semantically compatible with
it (see section 5.1.5.2).","[25, 26]"

When conditional protasis is much less certain in its potential factuality, or even counterfactual,
then the adverb kol is attached at the beginning of the protasis clause (see Section 7:6):
Kol

kil rpmi ti
HYP 2sg D take.care.IR Akwekgel
3sg sit.IR here
‘If you had taken care of Akwekgel, she would have stayed here (with you)’
Some conditional sentences do not have any overt conjunction intervening between the protasis
and the apodosis, for example when the future temporal adverb mpa starts the clause:
Kil
kinar
mpa
il
hu
3sg

cut.up5.6. Comparative and hypothetical uses of kol, kolen
One characteristic of the Urim language is that the same phonological form can have several
different functions without any morphological change, for example as a verb, noun and preposition..
One of these multi-categorial words is kol(en). It functions as a preposition/complementizer
expressing similarity ‘like’ and also as a modal adverb expressing hypothetical modality.",[233]
"Verb plus Demonstrative Adverb ConstructionsUrim has also special type of construction consisting of a motion or locative verb and
demonstrative adverb. These seem to be partly lexicalized serial structures functioning adverbially.
All three demonstrative words, pa, ti, and ai, can occur in this construction, kil only seldom.
Actually these three demonstratives are found in clear contrast only in this construction:
Kil
rpma
kai-pa
3sg
sit.R
go-there
‘He sits there’ (the referent is visible)
Kil
rpma
kai-ti / ti
3sg
sit.R
go-here / here
‘He sits here’ (near the speaker)
Kil
rpma
kai-ai
3sg
sit.R
go-remote
‘He sits over there’ (more distant compared to something else or not visible at all)
Often the serialized verb is added just to give more information about the location of referent like
in the following example:
Kil
kul karkok wang-wang rmpa-wai
3sg come blaze.R stem-stem lie -remote
‘He came and blazed the tree-stems lying there.’
Yo
kinar
ai
trum
tree go.down remote
kapok
‘The tree down there is kapok’100
In other cases the serialized construction is used because plain demonstrative adverb could
potentially be misinterpreted as a topic or emphatic marker. This is particularly the case with pa:
Ti
kai itni
kai
pa!
so
go
stand.IR go
there
‘Go then to stand over there!’
pa alone could be interpreted as emphatic marker.
Tu
awi
wayu
3pl take.R taro
‘They took that taro’ela
bepa
thereHere pa alone would be interpreted as givenness marker.
There is also a more lexicalized construction ha-pa /ha-ti which is usually pronounced as one
word. It is used only when introducing new non-topical referents into the text, usually inanimate
instruments or objects. Its function is to show that the instrument or object was already at hand or
near by when the action started.

In Urim, most conjunctions and conjunctive forms are clause initial. Some, however, are clause
final, and some are discontinuous. Many conjunctions operate on more than one level. For example,
the conjunctions a ‘and’, aki ‘or’ and kol ‘if, like’ can connect phrases, clauses, or sentences. Some
conjunctions, like atnen ‘because of’ and eng ‘therefore, so that’ govern embedded adverbial clauses,
but never connect independent sentences. Some conjunctions connect only clauses (pipa, titan), while
many connect both clauses and sentences (pa, atom etc.). In Urim there are following conjunctions.
Coordinating conjunctions:102a (sometimes wa after words ending in a vowel)
wa.....wa
aki
ari
pake‘and’‘and....again/also/further’
‘or’
‘but’
‘but’
(combination of pa ‘that’ + ise ‘PERF’ ---> pa-ke)Coordinating or weakly subordinating, temporal or expressing continuity:
... plalng, .... plalng pa, ... plalng pipa ‘after that, (when that had happened or finished)’
....titan, ....ninan
‘after that (a longer happening or action
finished)
am
‘now, then’ (immediately) (basically time word
‘now’)
atom
‘then, and’
Subordinating conjunctions:
- causative and conditional:
pa
‘when’
... pa,
‘when, if’
pipa
‘if’ (combination of pa +pa ---> pipa)
.... pipa,/pilpa, ‘when’, if
pati
‘so then’ (combination of pa +ti- ‘this’ --> pati)
....pati
‘what comes to that’
(kolpa) atom ‘so, therefore (often past)’
(kolpa) ti
‘this is why, therefore (often future)’
kolpa
‘therefore, being like that, like that (before quotation)’ (combination of kol ‘like’ +
pa
‘that’)
-hypothetical:kol / kolen
kol ... pa / kol ... pipa/pilpa
-‘if’
‘if’(also comparative ‘like’)expressing reason:eng
eng ntei‘so that, therefore’
‘therefore’(also preposition: Benefactive, Goal, Purpose etc.)
(originally interrogative pronoun ‘why?’)103
atnen‘therefore, because of’ (also preposition and verb ‘wait for, watch)- semantically neutral:
la ti
la‘what about’
‘that’(starts a new topic, from the verb la ‘speak’)
(semantically neutral complementizer governing the clausal
object of certain verbs)As is the case in many other languages, in Urim a number of the conjunctions appear to be built
out of demonstratives. The commonest conjunction in Urim, pa, is a near demonstrative ‘that’. This
demonstrative occurs also as part of conjunctions pake, pipa, pilpa, kolpa and pati. Three
conjunctions, kol, eng, and atnen a transparently related to prepositions. As well as taking nominal
complements, eng and atnen can also govern a clausal complement. Atnen is probably originally a
verb (there is a verb atnen ‘wait for, watch; hit). The conjunction ari ‘but’ is phonetically similar to
the verb ari ‘see’, but it is not clear whether or not this is an accidental resemblance. The verbs la
‘see’ and plalng ‘finish’ function as conjunctive forms too. The function of plalng as conjunction
resembles tail-head linkage which connects full sentences. Very much like conjunctions function the
words titan and nanan and reduplicated verb marking continuity. These words and reduplication
occur (often together) between clauses to show that the action described in the first clause continues
until the action of second clause starts. This structure and tail-head linkage are described in Chapters
5.5.7 and 5.7. Other conjunctions are described more fully in the Chapter 5. 5.
Examples of conjunctions:

Usually Urim conjunctions occur clause initially. Some conjunctions have two possible positions
between clauses, either at the end of the first clause before the pause, or after the pause starting the
second clause. This position seems to make the conjunction stronger, emphasize it, and sometimes is
also provides slightly different meaning compared to the initial position. In speech the conjunction
occurring clause finally usually gets prominent (high pitch - long vowel) intonation.

More rarely the conjunction in Urim may also occur inside the clause. In most cases the position
of conjunction in the middle of clause can be explained thematically. Fronting of object can move it
even to the front of conjunctions. This may be a feature of spoken language only.

2.12.1. The Problem of Word Boundaries in Urim
In Urim there are some difficulties in determining whether a construction is a compound word or
a phrase. Phonological criteria alone are not sufficient, because a grammatical phrase may
phonologically be one word, especially idioms. On the other hand, the boundaries of a phonological
word are not very clear in Urim. Many morphophonemic rules can be applied over a larger domain,
some apply over a more restricted domain than phonological word. Here we will briefly consider
various rules and other boundary marks that help to determine word boundaries in Urim.
a) Stress
Stress is the clearest mark of a phonological word in Urim. A phonological word can have only one
main stress in Urim, as indicated in the following examples:107
‘kol
like‘like this’‘ti
this‘only’‘kol#ti
like-this
‘wris
one‘only one’‘ata
onlyki’pman ‘wris#ata
man
one-only‘only men’ (not ‘only one man’!)‘yankipm#ok
talk-mouth‘talk’i’lkim
pit‘ok
mouth‘mouth of a pit’‘maur
spirit‘kanokg-en
ground-ATR‘a spirit living inside the ground’‘ka
grasshopper‘grasshopper sp.’‘maur#ka’nokg-en
spirit-ground-ATRHowever, stress is not very reliable in determining whether or not the construct is grammatically
one word, because two nouns or two verbs can be joined phonologically under one stress when no
modifiers occur in between:
‘door’‘wan#yun
house-door
‘wan
house‘wail
big‘yun
door‘door of a big house’compare to:
‘wan#yun

"The use of pa with pronouns to mark changing topicWhen the deictic particle pa occurs with pronouns or other inherently definite noun phrasess, it
has special functions. It can be used to emphasize or clarify the referent, but usually its occurrence
with a pronoun marks a changing topic.
In Urim the same pronoun can occur in successive clauses referring to two different participants
without any occurrences of full noun phrases in between. This is possible, because the demonstrative
pa can also be used with pronouns to indicate a changing referent.

(the use of pa marks that the pronouns refer to different persons)
In following examples, pa is used with pronouns or generic nouns to mark changing actor-topic:

travelling and I asked her now, ... And she said, ...’
The use of pa is not automatic with a change of Subject. Its use seems to require that the referent
of the pronoun will persist as the Subject in more than just one sentence; i.e.topicality governs this use252
of pa. In the last example, the pronouns kil ‘he’ and kupm ‘I’ are without pa in spite of the fact that
they represent changing actor. The reason why pa never occurs with plural pronouns in this example
might be, that since ‘we’ includes both actors, the topic is not really viewed as changing. Notice also
that Object pronouns can be marked by pa when its referent occurs as actor-topic in the next sentence.
In the following example, the pronominalized Object is marked as topical by using pa, before the
referent occurs as subject:

Prepositions are defined as uninflected forms, which take a noun phrase complement and serve as
a mediating form between the noun phrase and the predicate, specifying its semantic role in the
predication. In Urim, there is only one ‘real’ preposition: eng.11 It is used to encode nearly all
oblique/peripheral arguments in the clause encoding a wide variety of semantic roles, including: 1)
Benefactive, 2) Recipient, 3) Locative Goal, 4) Purpose, 5) Reason, and 6) ‘about/concerning’. In
most cases eng appears to mark the referential domain with respect to which the predicate is true or
applicable. Perhaps this is its most basic meaning.
The form eng alternates with another, rarer form ekg. In the Kukwo dialect and in the western
villages of the Yangkolen dialect, this other form is more commonly used for these functions.","[49, 50]"

3sgIn the above examples the serial motion verb is necessary to define the semantic role of the NP.
When a position verb is predicate, the NP expressing Locative Goal has the status of Object in Urim
and is grammatically unmarked like the object of transitive verbs. (This is why these predicates are
called semitransitive in Urim.) With semitransitive verbs the serialization with motion verbs is used
to add extra information about the direction of the distance of the Goal in relation to the speaker.

It is difficult to motivate a coordinating versus subordinating distinction for many of the
conjunctions. Therefore conjunctions are described here simply on a semantic basis according to the
type(s) of relationship they express. As is the case in many languages, some of the most common
Urim conjunctions seem to be morphologically composed of deictic forms. These are pa, ti, pake,
pipa and their combinations The deictic form pa has an especially wide range of conjunctive
functions. Some prepositions and time words (like a, eng, ak, am) play a role in connecting sentences,
as do a few verbs as well (e.g. la).",[207]
"Temporal adverbs as connectives
Urim language has several temporal adverbs (am, wet, weti, wuten, ikga, katnukg, mpa) which
are used to mark the time when situations occur. These typically occur without an associated
conjunction and indicate temporal discontinuity; i.e. a switch to a different temporal setting.",[219]

It will also be noted that all singular and second person forms begin with <k>; all non-singular
third person forms begin with tu-, and all non-singular first person forms begin with m (e,i)n-.
The pronouns may occur in the following clausal slots: 1) subject (or topic in topic clauses), 2)
non-topical first object, 3) second object, and 4) object of a preposition.

Subject referent is very generic or indefinite. Indefinite reference is sometimes also expressed by zero
anaphora, if some other NP is in the topic position in the clause. Third person singular indefinite
referents are also often expressed by using the noun kamel ‘body’ (comp. old English!) at least in the
object position. The third person plural pronoun tu is also used within the noun phrase to encode
plurality of human (or at least animate) entities (see section 2. 3. 1. 1)

The third person singular person pronoun kil sometimes functions as a demonstrative pronoun
instead of the near demonstrative ti, and may in this function be attached to other singular pronouns or
nouns (see also the first example above). In this function kil can refer both to animate and inanimate
entities:

In Urim, personal pronouns may be modified by demonstratives and quantifiers. When the far
demonstrative pa occurs modifying a personal pronoun, this construction has thematic function. The
demonstrative pa is used with personal pronouns to emphasize, express contrast, and mark something
as topical. This last function of pa makes it possible that in Urim texts two persons can be referred by
personal pronouns all the way through after initial introduction, even when the actor or speaker
changes:
Kupm asen kil pa om:.... Ari kil pa la-la:...
1sg
ask.R 3sg D now

The Object pronominal clitics are phonologically adjoined to the verb. They conflate the nonsingular number categories of the free pronouns, distinguishing only: 1) first, second, and third
persons, and 2) singular versus non-singular numbers.
Person
1
2
3Singular
=opm
=etn/eitn
==elNon-Singular
=o
=epm
=enFollowing the applicative verbal suffix -n, a further inclusive versus exclusive distinction is made in
the first person plural forms:
1
1=(n)tilo
=nto/-(n)=ilo/
/-n=o/(Inclusive)
(Exclusive)In the form –(n)tilo /n/ surfaces in quick speech, but not in slow and careful speech.
It can be seen that the singular Object pronominal clitics and the second person plural form
resemble the free pronouns, but have undergone two changes: 1) loss of initial /k/, and 2) lowering of
the high vowels /i,u/ to /e,o/.
The Object pronominal clitics occur in the first Object slot, immediately following the verb, and
are phonologically bound to the verb. Consider the following examples:
Takgni
al =o
sun
eat.R-1plO
‘The sun burned us badly’
Kil

put.R-3plO road-road
‘They left them out (of the car) along the road’
Uwi – n – til=o!
take.IR-TR-3sgO-1plO
‘Take it for us!’
As the examples show, there are some morphophonemic changes when the pronoun clitic is
attached to the verb. These changes follow the general morphophonemic rules explained in Chapter
1.
It is also possible for the free pronouns to occur in the Object slot. Compare the following examples:
Tu
or-opm
3pl
hit-1sgO
‘They hit me’
Tu
or kupm ti-ke!
3sg hit 1sg
this/here-EMP
‘It was me they hit!’

la-la: ....
then
1sg
say tell.R 3sg D
say-say
‘Then I told told to him:...’ (changing topic)
A bound pronominal Object is used when there is no need to highlight the pronoun for purposes
of contrast, emphasis, etc. The free pronoun is always used if any modifier co-occurs with the Object
pronoun. In the example immediately above, the demonstrative pronoun pa is used either for
emphasis or because the actor changes after this clause.
What is said here applies also when a personal pronoun is used to refer to a peripheral clausal
argument (its semantic role typically being Recipient-Benefactive or Locative-Goal) . It is promoted
to core argument in the form of bound pronoun when the referent is an already activated topic that is
simply being maintained. All uses of the bound Object pronouns are thematically unmarked ‘normal’
uses. The use of a free pronoun in this position indicates extra prominence or emphasis on the referent
(for more examples see Section 2.2.4).
The object pronominal clitics also occur as the result of a syntactic process of possessor
ascension, which lifts the possessor of an inalienable noun (usually a body part) out of the noun
phrase to serve as the Object of the verb. It is possible to have both the Object clitic and a coreferential genitive pronoun if the possessor referent is especially emphasized or in focus, as in the
second example below:44Drapuk

eyeWhen the verb and body part form a lexical unit, the Object pronominal clitic is obligatory. This
might be the origin of the use of suffix -el in idioms and lexemes as adverbializer. Compare
especially the two first examples below:

The genitive pronouns exhibit the same person, number, and exclusive-inclusive distinctions as
the independent pronouns, being formed by phonologically adjoining the relative clause
complementizer a to a following independent pronoun. In essence, then, genitives in Urim are
formally a kind of minimal relative clause: pig that (is) I/mine = my pig.
In addition, one or both of the following two modifications to the pronominal forms are possible:
1) the attributive suffix -en may be added to them, and 2) an /l/ may be added between the relative
clause complementizer a and the independent pronominal form. Thus, there are four possible forms
for each genitive pronoun. 8

The genitive pronouns occur following the noun and indicate relationships like: 1) kinship, 2)
body parts, 3) ownership, 4) production, 5) belongingness, 6) Exclusion/Emphatis (only the forms
containing the consonant /l/ but lacking the suffix; alkupm etc.).

"Manner adverbial clauses
In Urim manner is usually expressed by serial constructions, which almost always occur beforethe main verb (like manner adverbs usually do) and can therefore possibly be considered
subordinated:
Kil
pa tuwal
mlak
3sg
D beak
hanging
‘It was lying beak hanging down’ela
beManner serials marked by ak:
Manner serials can be marked by the Instrumental marker ak (originally verb ak ‘do’) same way
as manner adverbs.
Tu

Compare to the following use of ak to mark manner phrase:
tu
ak
wail wuli
3pl
use.R big
arrive
‘They came in crowds’
Often ak functions almost like the purpose marker eng and can be translated in English the same
way ‘for’. The difference is that ak can also indicate the role of instrument, while eng never does.

In Urim there is also a special type of adverbial manner clause, which always occurs in the middle
of the clause and has a verb morphologically marked by the suffix -en. This attributive suffix has
been described earlier in the section 2.6.2.2. Sometimes this embedded (or nominalized) manner
adverbial clause also has a reversed word order (O V). Curiously though, only a few verbs in Urim
seem to take this suffix in a manner clause, while simple manner adverbs can freely be formed from
all kinds of verbs by the same suffix. It seems that this embedded construction also has the additional
meaning of two actions having temporal overlap. This could explain why so few verbs can occur in
this construction; there are not so very many actions that one actor can perform two at the same time.
Often the manner suffix -en could be glossed ‘with’ in English. Consider the examples:
Kupm

‘I arrived carrying the child’

same way as above:

"Eng with noun phrases and clauses
Prepositional phrases with eng are used to encode various types of Oblique arguments. It is
commonly used to encode Benefactive-Recipient and Subject Matter ‘about/concerning’:
Uwi
pa iye
take.IR D carry.IR
‘Bring it to me!’kul

1sg OBL work
‘He spoke to me about the work’
Kil
kansil-opm eng okipma
3sg
lie.R-1sgO OBL food
‘He lied to me about the food’
Eng is also used to mark some optional non-Subject arguments of some verbs. The semantic role
is usually Associative ‘concerning, with respect to’, Goal or Reason/Cause:190

Kil
ngkark

3sg
be.afraid.R OBL dog
‘He is afraid of the dog’
Subordinate clauses headed by eng express purpose, reason, or explanation. There is no
difference whether the purpose is expressed by using a full clause or just a noun phrase - eng is used
in both cases to mark it.

This is reflected by the many cases where either eng or some other function word can be used without
any great change of meaning. There are also cases when eng occurs in speech but is rejected in good
written language (the fourth example):

Purpose
In the following examples eng can be glossed ‘for, to, so that, in order to’. Notice the position of
imperative in the first example; it shows that this eng-clause in fact is embedded. Note that the
purposive interpretation of eng is favored when it governs a clause having irrealis modality

happening at the moment, it expresses reason or explanation rather than purpose. In the following
examples eng can usually be glossed ‘because’.

Reason/Grounds
Eng is also used to govern subordinate clauses expressing reason or grounds, i.e. why the
preceding clause is uttered, or why the proposition it expresses is valid.
