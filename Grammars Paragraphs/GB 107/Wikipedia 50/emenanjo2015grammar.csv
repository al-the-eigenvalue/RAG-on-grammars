Paragraph,Page number
"Negation, like interrogation, is a case of non-assertion. It is thus a
proposition that is neither an affirmation nor a declaration. Re-stated in
terms of sentences, negation is neither a positive/declarative sentence nor
an affirmative sentence. Negation expresses a denial or contradiction of
some or all the meaning of a sentence. When the denial is of some element
of the meaning of the sentence (or proposition), the negation is said to be
constituent, as in Isekiri (Omamor, 1977) or Esan (Ejele, 1995). But where
the denial is of the entire meaning of the sentence (or proposition), the
negation is said to be sentential or standard. Payne (1985/88) has done one
of the most detailed studies of negation strategies in human language. These
strategies include the use of:
(i)negated quantifiers(ii)inherently negative quantifiers(iii)negated adverbials(iv)negative verbs(v)negative particles(vi)negative auxiliaries(vii)morphological negatives(viii) negative nounsEmenanjo, Nolue.

N(P)s in which the pre-verbal and the post-verbal ones are obligatory and in
a relationship of identity. See especially (13)-(16).
BE sentences can also be stative sentences marking location as in
(18), or be descriptive, identifying states as in (13) – (16).
We need to recollect that Igbo has stative verbs, the Stative verb form,
and the Factative verb form. Igbo Stative verbs, like stative verbs in other
languages, are not often used in the progressive aspect and rarely take the
Illative suffix =tA, except for idiomatic purposes. (Emenanjo 1978:140). The
Stative and the Factative verb forms have essentially identical semantic
interpretations. The only difference is that while the Stative verb form does
not take the =rV suffixes, the Factative takes the =rV suffixes. Compare (9) –
(14) which are in the Factative verb form, and (15) – (18) which are in the
Stative verb form. In some dialects the =rV is optional as in, (13) and (14).

(a)
These can be affirmative/positive or negative assertions. All the examples so
far given in this chapter; (1) – (18), are affirmative assertions. The negative
counterpart of these are realized by the affixation of the general negative
suffix =ghI, to the auxiliary verb, or main verb, as the case may be, with the
attendant tonal patterns determined by the verb form. For the treatment of
affirmative and negative assertions, see Chapter 19.","[568, 569]"
"If we compare 7 (a) – (d) with 9 (a) – (d), and 6 (a) – (g), with 4 (a) – (g), we
shall find that (9) and (10) are the negative equivalents of the affirmative (7)
and (8).
The Imperative-Progressive
This is a complex form, with affirmative and negative equivalents. As the
name implies, this verb form combines the features of the Imperative and
the Progressive.",[555]
"Sentences (6) and (7) are affirmative RC, while (8) is a negative RC. In (8)
notice that the downstep which was to be hosted by the verb in (6) is hosted
by both /ni/ and the general negative marker /ho/ but not by the vowel of
the verb root.",[443]
"Like, in the Imperative, the Hortative is restricted to action verbs. For more
on the Hortative see chapter 19, and Emenanjo (1978:196-197).

These are used for asking questions.
They are marked by interrogatives, proclitics, tone patterns and
features of intonation.
They can be classified in terms of the answers they elicit, thus:
(i)Polar or Disjunctive Qs
• These elicit yes/no answers as in:
(38) Ò gà-àbia
Will he come?(ii)They admit of a Tag-system, as in:Tag-Qs
These are attached to the end of a statement so as to convey a
positive/affirmative or negative orientation.
(39)Ezè gà-àbia, ò bùkwà ya?
Eze will come, is it so?",[573]
"It has not (yet) been good.
The General Negative suffix has different morphological realizations that are
dialect–specific. What we have used here is the Standard form used in
contemporary Igbo writing and speech. While constituent negation is
marked morphosyntactically, sentential marking is marked by negative
auxiliaries, and, inherently negative inflectional suffixes, especially suffixes.
Igbo really exhibits morphological negation because the negative markers
are part of the derivational morphology of the verb. This is unlike in Igala
(Ejeba 2009), Efik (Mensah 2001), and Ibibio (Essien 1990) where tone alone
marks negation. In Igbo, tone is part of the entire configuration on the
auxiliaries, participles, inflectional affixes and noun complements of the
verb form.",[501]
"(32)O gà-àlu ya,
Affirmative
He will marry herò bukwaghi ya?
Negative
Is it not so?",[502]
"In (52) – (55) all essentially polar questions, there are nuances of positive
and negative assumptions, as well as neutral, positive and negative
expectations and, most times, strong doses of sarcasm, irony, disbelief,
uncertainty and impossibility!
Intonation and Interrogation
In the ethnography and pragmatics of Igbo speech, noun phrases can be
pronounced with a higher than high pitch as well as with lengthened vowels
and features of non-verbal communication to indicate something that is a
cross between a question and an exclamation. See:
ezi okwu
e: zi okwu
mmadù ìto
mmadù ìto o‘true word, truth’
‘Can this be true? Are you sure?
‘three persons’
Three persons? You mean three persons?",[436]
"Tense and Aspect in Igbo
A study of Igbo verbal categories carried to its logical conclusion will reveal
that tense and aspect are copiously and grammatically marked in Igbo. Past,
Future and Future-in-the-Past tenses have been identified while Stative,
Factative. Imperfective and Perfective aspects have been identified. Credit
must, however, be given to Spencer (1892) and Adams (1932) who
recognized what we now know as aspects but which they treated as tense
because aspect and aspectology were still unknown in their days. Indeed,
the seminal paper on aspectology was written and published by a
Russianized Dane, L.P. Razmuen in 1891 entitled ‘On the Verbal Tense and
their Relations to the Aspects’, in Russian, German and French – the
English translation of the work. That work stimulated further works on
Russian and the Slavonic languages where aspect instead of tense is the
predominant verbal category. Tense is the grammaticalization of the location
of time in trinary terms of: past, present and future. Aspect is the
grammaticalization of the duration of time in essentially binary terms of:
perfective and imperfective. Whereas tense deals with static, atelic and
definite time and is deictic, aspect deals with dynamic, telic and extended
time but is non-deictic. Yet, different as tense and aspect are in theory, in
practice, at least, in Igbo, they cut-across and criss-cross themselves in verb
forms. To adequately capture the cross-cutting and criss-crossing nature of
tense and aspect in Igbo, we find it convenient, as we did in Emenanjo
(1985: 153;1985) to arrange these two categories along two axes: the vertical
for tense, and the horizontal, for aspect, thus. (See Tables 28 and 29)
Tense and Negation
Other than aspect, the only other category which affects tense in Igbo is
polarity. Polarity determines the choice of the tense marker in most cases.
Affirmative markers are invariably different from negative markers where the
marking is not brought about by periphrastic structures. Tables 28 and 30
contain the significant affirmative tense and aspect markers. Tables 29 and
31 contain those that mark negation for the various tenses and aspects. Let
us take a few examples.",[495]

Yet, sometimes, an interrogative may be so presented that it elicits a positive
answer. In this case it has a positive or negative orientation, as in:

marker is suffixed to the verb. But in constituent negation, the element to be
negated moves from its original post-verbal position to a position
immediately after the periphrastic element.
Negation, Tense, Aspect and Serial Verbal Constructions (SVCs)
In Igbo, all the inflectional markers of tense, aspect, and negation are
marked on the first verb in a SVC. Extensional suffixes and clitics can,
however, be found on the second and subsequent verbs in the SVC.

"Furthermore, Nwigwe in her conclusion asserts that Declaratives and
Interrogatives share a morpho-syntactic relationship. All declarative and
interrogative sentences in the non-perfect indicative mood bear a low tone
nasal prefix N in Ngwa (= Ø in most other Igbo dialects).
Those in the perfective indicative mood bear a low tone harmonizing
vowel prefix, È. Floating tones remain, on the deletion of the prefixes.
According to Nwigwe ‘the interrogative sentences are transformations
of the declarative. The QWs, tonal modifications and syntactic variations are
not inflectional (but lexicalized) and cannot be a basis for the classification
of the interrogative as a distinct mood.
The general view held by some Igbo scholars that a low tone on
subject pronouns marks interrogation in Igbo applies to only affirmative
interrogative sentences. In the negative form the low tones become high. The
tone of the subject pronoun in interrogative sentences, is conditioned by
polarity. As our analyses of interrogation have shown, the situation is a lot
more complex than Nwigwe has shown. In fact, she seems to me to lump
Polar Questions with the floating low tones, and WH-Q (= her QWs).
Nwigwe finally concludes that ‘the interrogative’ is not a distinct mood
in Igbo. It is a subclass within the indicative mood’
The interrogative belongs to interrogation, which is a morphosyntactic phenomenon, with three major sets of verb forms or types: Polar,
WH, and Indirect.",[437]

thus: adī (i.e. a high tone prefix followed by a step tone root) plus the

place which involves the movement of the affected constituent to the ‘focal

"Finally, interrogation is used in the grammatical classification of verb forms
or sentence types which are usually in contrast to declarative or affirmative
forms, as in Figure XI.
The Position of Interrogation in Igbo
Igbo has the three types of questions identified above. Polar or Yes-No
Questions have already been treated in the different chapters on
Pronominalization and Cliticization in this book. We will therefore, focus in
this chapter on the two other types of questions, among other issues
concerned with interrogation, beginning with WH-Questions.
WH-Questions
Green and Igwe (1963), Nwachukwu (1976), Uwalaka, (1997), Goldsmith
(1981) among others have contributed variously to different aspects of
interrogation in Igbo.",[424]
"In (6) a noun-numeral phrase is distinguished from a noun-noun (or
associative) phrase. In (7) an ordinary associative construction of noun plus
noun is distinguished from a genitive of personification or noun-proper noun
also called the specific construction (Williamson 1986).
In (8): (a) is a simple affirmative verb form
(b) is a simple polar question
(c) is a simple negative verb form
(d) is a simple negative clause
(e) is a simple negative rhetorical interrogative clause.
All the examples in (6)-(8) above reveal that tone is crucial and central to
Igbo lexicology, lexicography and syntax. To ignore tone is to ignore an
important code which not only identifies the language but also makes the it
unique. This explains why those who are tone deaf and those who care less
about the importance and significance of tone cannot identify the words thatEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,114A Grammar of Contemporary Igbocannot be adjectives, or adverbs because they are essentially and tonally
nouns and nominals, even if their English glosses suggest some thing else!
Again, those who refer to any noun + noun structure as a compound noun
either trivialize a crucial tonal fact or are ignorant about the grammatical
function of tone in the language.
Given the place of tone in Igbo, nouns and verbs have to be classified
on tonal lines, before all other possible classifications.
Tone Classes of Nouns
In terms of the number of syllables they have as well as their inherent tone
patterns, Igbo nouns may be classified into four major tone groups, thus:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)monosyllabic
disyllabic
trisyllabic
polysyllabicCopyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.(a)
Monosyllabic Nouns
These have a CV structure. They all have inherent high tones. They are very
few in number and include the following:

these fall into five tone classes.

The Associative construction is a noun phrase made up of two nouns in
which the meaning is roughly ‘N1 is associated with N2’.
Tone Groups of Nouns
In accordance with their tonal behaviour in the associative construction
among others in the grammar, the five tone classes of disyllable nouns can
be conveniently classified into two tone groups. These are:
Tone Group A (T.G.A) nouns – made of Tone Classes I and II (and the
monosyllabic nouns).
Tone Group B (T.G.B) nouns – made up of Tone Classes III, IV and V.","[148, 149, 150]"
"Like the Imperative, the Hortative is more seriously restricted with regard to
verbal categories. If it becomes necessary to express the negative form, some
lexicalization process, resulting in a periphrastic form may be used.

"Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,542A Grammar of Contemporary IgboThere are five verbs in (53) without any connectives or conjunctions linking
them in spite of our gloss. All the verbs are used with their complements.
(ii)All the verbs in the SVC function syntactically as one consistent unit
or whole in terms of subject NP. Syntactic processes like interrogation
or assertion, and, also, in terms of verbal categories like negation,
tense and aspect. Sentence (53) is an affirmative, non-interrogative
sentence that is essentially in the simple progressive aspect. The truth
of this becomes obvious if we present the deep structure of (53) thus:
53(a) A nà-ejì mmà na-àsu oru, na-ègbu anu, na-egbù osisi, na-alù
agha.
People use the knife for cutting the bush in preparation for
farming, slaughtering animals, cutting trees and fighting wars.(53) and 53(a) have exactly the same meaning. The only difference between
them is that the simple progressive/durative marker, the auxiliary, -na, has
been deleted in (53) because the SVC is one consistent unit in which all the
verbs agree in terms of affirmation and aspect. If the sentence becomes an
interrogative it will be realized on the NP(s), as is the case with Polar Qs, as
in:
53(b) À nà-èji mmà…
Polar-Q: Do people…","[576, 577]"

"Mood and Modality in Igbo
We used to be skeptical about the relevance of mood as a grammatical
verbal category in Igbo. We shared this skepticism with Welmers and
Welmers (1968), Welmers (1973), Green and Igwe (1963), and Oluikpe
(1978). Without specifically mentioning or defining mood and modality,
Oluikpe identifies different types of ‘modal expressions’ – requests, promises,
threats, wishes, intentions, obligations and necessity. We have, however,
never failed to realize the strong nuances of mood and modality co-existing
with tense and aspect in Igbo (Emenanjo 1978, 1985, 1990). But in view of
the orientation of this book which recognizes both grammaticalization and
lexicalization as universal features in human language, and especially so
when human language is treated as a medium of (meta)communication. In
this regard, one cannot continue to ignore the ‘existence’ of mood and
modality in Igbo but agree with Nwigwe (2004). Besides, studies of various
dialects of Igbo have thrown up some interesting evidence of the crisscrossing implications of tense, aspect, negation, futurity, mood and modality
in Igbo. These include Spencer (1924), Adams (1932); Igwe, Levi (1987,
2003, 2007), of the Achi dialects, Nwachukwu (1980, 2000) of some Mbaise
dialect, Nwigwe (1996; 2004) of the Ngwa dialect, Winston (1973) of the
Òĥuĥu dialect, Ukata (1981) of the Oloko and Nkwere dialects, Williamson
(1980), and Okolo (1995) of some lects of the “generalized” or “Compromise”
Igbo.
Even among those who accept mood and modality as relevant verbal
categories in Igbo, as being marked morpho-syntactically, as well as,
semantically and pragmatically, there is a lack of unanimity in the morphosyntactic strategies identified, and their number. The number varies:

Indicative, Sequential, Imperative and Subjunctive.
Like tense, aspect and negation, mood is a secondary grammatical category
in Igbo, which is realized on the verb and in the verbal system. Like the
other secondary grammatical categories, mood is expressed inflectionally by
one or more of the following markers: tones, inflectional prefixes and
suffixes, and auxiliary verbs complemented by nomino-verbals. In line with
the findings in the extant literature in general linguistics, I agree with
Palmer (2001), Muir (1972), on the issue of mood and how it is marked. I
agree partially with Okolo (1995), Emenanjo (1981), Nwachukwu (1980),
Williamson (2000), Ukata (1981), Igwe (1972), Winston (1973), Uwalaka
(1988). But I agree more fully with Nwigwe (2004). Nwigwe (2004: 67) is
essentially a re-definition and a re-classification of Igwe, Levi (1987). Using
morpho-syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features which produce
‘contrasting inflectional paradigms’ Nwigwe defines mood as an ‘inflectional
category’ and identifies three moods in Igbo. These are ‘anchored on the
verb…’, marked by tones, affixes, syntax, semantics and contrasting
inflectional paradigms and organized in sentence types. All things
considered, we identify three moods, thus:Copyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.x

This mood is used to express or describe an event or state which, in the
mental world of the speaker, is considered a fact, a reality, an assertion and
a declaration. It is also used by the speaker to seek information on the
assertion, from an addressee, in terms of declaration, interrogation, and
negation. Thus, sentences in the Indicative mood are marked for tense,
aspect, interrogation and negation. Each of the sentences in the Indicative is
a full and independent clause.
Indeed, Nwigwe’s Indicative mood is, by and large, equivalent to
Winston’s and Williamson’s Definite and General moods respectively, and
subsumes the verb forms fully described in Chapter 19 of this work and
neatly captured by Tables, 28 – 31.","[548, 549]"

"The main purpose of semantics is to explain that primary
conceptual or ‘logical’ aspect of meaning and that, in particular,
we have to account for certain semantic categories and
relationships which apply to sentences such as: synonymy,
entailment, contradiction, semantic anomaly, etc.
Synonymy
This is the first of the many ways sentence or statement meaning may be
expressed. Synonymy subsumes sameness of meaning between sentences
and can be formally stated thus:
Statement X is synonymous with statement Y when, if X is true Y is
also true; if X is false, Y is also false, as in:

In fact, affective meaning conveys the language users’ feelings,
attitudes and opinions about a particular piece of information in an ongoing
context. Whereas linguistic, including referential meaning, results in
denotation, both social and affective meaning result in connotation.
Connotation combines the features of social meaning i.e. the information
about the social nature of the language users or of the context of utterance
and affective meaning i.e. what the language user feels about the context or
some other context. Connotation is, indeed, the additional meaning that anEmenanjo, Nolue.

The above discussions show that deixis is both a grammatical and a
semantic notion. Personal, spatial and temporal deixis share a basic point of
reference: the speaker’s identity and location in time and space. Deixis can,
however be grammaticalized and lexicalized, i.e. through both function
words/morphemes like demonstratives or pronouns or affixes, or words like
here and there. In Igbo, as in all languages, there is considerable overlap
among the different types of deixis. For example, the demonstratives can be
used to mark more than one deixis, as in:
nwata à
ihe à
ùtutu à‘this child’ (personal deixis)
‘this thing’ (spatial deixis)
‘this morning’ (temporal deixis)Finally, because deixis is a semantic notion, we find that the three basic
types of deixis illustrate how semantic notions permeate syntax and human
language beyond the simple lexical meaning of words. This is because deixis
brings in utterance meaning into language use. All of these happen because
language is essentially a vector for communication beyond the lexical and
sentence or utterance meaning.
Holophrases
Holophrases are one-word verbless sentences or ontological statements.
These do not have any of the identifiable sentence elements. They have no
nuclei or margins, no NPs or verbs, and thus cannot participate at all in
clause structure. Nevertheless, they carry in themselves the syntactic values
of whole nuclei or sentences or utterances.
Holophrases can be sub-divided further in accordance with the
inherent lexical content of the respective words, thus:

"Mood, Modality, Tense, and Aspect
Mood, tense and aspect are secondary grammatical categories, modality is a
primary semantic-pragmatic category. But all of them are expressed in the
verbal system. Mood, tense and aspect however, are all related to time and
the temporal dimension. Tense locates an event or state with respect to a
definite point in time in terms of present, past and future. Aspect locates an
event or state with respect to non-static or dynamic time in terms of
duration, iteration, habituation, inceptiveness, completion, in completion,
progressiveness etc. Mood identifies the relationship between the speaker
and, especially, his attitude and that of the addressee within a factual or
hypothetic time frame, about the actuality or, otherwise, of the event or state
in terms of assertion (indicative) command (imperative) wish, desire,
condition. Yet, whereas tense and aspect deal with events/states in time,
mood and modality deal with their realities and possibilities.
Future: Mood or Tense?
Like aspect, tense and mood are grammatical categories which specify or
characterize the basic statement or event encoded in the verb. But whereas
tense locates the statement or event in static time, mood describes it in real
or hypothetical time. The actuality of the statement or event from the point
of view of the speaker’s attitude are presented in terms of its actuality or
non-actuality, and their plurality of nuances include: certainty,
definitiveness, vagueness, potentially, possibility, necessity, desirability,
obligation, permission, command, exhortation etc.
By its very nature, future enlists a wide range of semantic
interpretations or possibilities which include: certainty, vagueness,
potentiality, possibility, desirability, necessity, obligation or compulsion as
in:

‘He will certainly come.’Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo525The glosses above need some adverbials to indicate the very nuances
required. Unlike (15) and (16), (17) and (18) have implications of obligation,
and logical necessity that are better translated as ‘obliged to’, ‘ought to’,
‘must’, ‘have to’.
Indeed, all of (15)-(18) have strong modal nuances within the Future
verb form marked by the auxiliary verb -ga complemented by nominoverbals: a simple participle in (15) and (18), an infinitive in (16) and an
obligative participle in (17). In the light of the above is -ga not better
classified as a modal rather than an auxiliary? In fact, many languages do
not distinguish syntactically and morphologically between future tense and
potential or irrealis mood. In French, future tense often indicates probability
or a situation which is very close to what happens. In Igbo -ga expresses
possibility as well as future. Ultan (1978), in his detailed study on future,
with data from some forty languages across the world, confirms that:
xfuture markings/-ers can be used to mark both temporal and nontemporal functions including aspect and mood.","[559, 560]"
