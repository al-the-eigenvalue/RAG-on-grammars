Grammatical gender does not exist. For persons, sex is
expressed either by a different word or by the addition of kashel

For animals, etc., different words exist in a few cases
to express sex; in others kaus (male), kar (female) are a#ded, e.g.

tushi ka;t', female guinea-fowl,.,In the normal way, gifi,gil, tushi, etc., are used without
the adjectives to indicate the male; when it is necessary to speak
of the female, kar is added.
