The negative particle wá always occurs clause-finally and modifies or negates the
preceding verb, verb predicate or clause. Since neither its position nor function
differs from adverbs, the negative particle can also be analyzed as an adverb. As in
(14a), the negative particle occurs as the last word of the verb phrase and may be
separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. The negative particle
may also negate an adverb of manner as in (b) or a prepositional phrase functioning
as an adverb as in (c).

14.1IntroductionIn the previous chapters, various morphemes have been shown to be distinct in form.
We now present many of the same morphemes in their syntactic context to show
their function. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb
forms are shown to be syntactically distinct. In non-verbal clauses, copular clitics
are shown to take the place of separate copula particles, which are functionally
equivalent but different in form. Relative clauses are morphologically marked for
definiteness and grammatical function, and they receive the marking instead of the
head noun they modify.
In this chapter, we first discuss grammatical function of constituents in 14.2 and
word order in 14.3, then verbal clauses in 14.4 and verbal valency in 14.5, followed
by non-verbal clauses in 14.6, relative clauses in 14.7, evidentiality in 14.8, and
finally noun phrases in 14.9.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"
"Normally, the underlying root vowel of monosyllabic, open-syllable nouns is long.
But in nouns such as t ̪ɔ́ɔ́ / tɔ̪ -́ gg ‘cow’ which have a short root vowel, the vowel is
realized as long in the singular form. In the plural form with final consonant, the
vowel remains short.
In verbs such as nág-gā /nág-d̪ā ‘sleep.SBJV1sN/.1pN’ with root-final velar plosive,
the velar plosive is elided in word-final position of incompletive forms {P2}, as will
be discussed in 9.6. The resulting monosyllabic open-syllable verb with underlying
short vowel surfaces with a long vowel nāā ‘sleep.INCP’.
The lengthening rule of {P4} requires that the minimal surface word for nouns and
verbs have at least mid syllable weight. The process does not apply to other parts of
speech such as the negative wá ‘no, not’ or the adverb tu̪ ‘towards, upward’. These
adverbs, which are separate words, are discussed in chapter 13.",[41]
"Sentence-level syntax313The relativizer ná along with the interrogative pronoun īsíīn ‘which’ takes the place
of a relative clause. When taking the place of a relative clause modifying a subject,
it can be pre-verbal as in (12a) or post-verbal as in (b). When taking the place of a
relative clause modifying an object, it can be post-verbal as in (c) or pre-verbal in
(d). Another way of replacing a relative clause is with the copula tā̪ and the
interrogative pronoun īsí ‘how’ as in (e).

Focus is constructed by fronting the constituent which the speaker deems as the most
important bit of information for the clause. Both subjects and objects can be fronted
in focus.
Normally, prepositional phrases used as adjunct conjunctions such as ɛ̄ mūn náán ‘at
that time’ occur sentence-initially or following a conjunction.

throughout to capture and eat him, the devil creature is fronted in order to emphasize
him as being the victor.

Gaahmg is a morphologically rich language, employing many suffixes and clitics on
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. [ATR] quality and tone distinguish a significant
number of lexemes and grammatical functions. Several specific processes of
consonant weakening, vowel elision, [+ATR] spreading, [+round] spreading, and
morphological tone rules, account for the vast majority of alternations when
morphemes are combined.
Gaahmg suffixes differ in alternation and function from clitics, where the former are
mostly inflectional morphemes which attach to underlying root segments, whereas
the latter are mostly functional, derivational or clausal morphemes which attach to
surface stem segments.
All pronouns except interrogatives use vowel features to represent the person
referred to, the three persons coinciding with the language's three vowel harmony
pairs. Nouns may attach singular and plural suffixes, although plural suffixes are by
far more common, and have various segmental and tonal allomorphs which mostly
have no semantic correlation with the nouns to which they attach. Nouns and
adjectives attach one or more of seven clitics to the stem, each with segmental or
tonal allomorphs which depend on the stem-final segment.
The verb has five morpheme slots in addition to the root. Antipassive and causative
morphemes attach immediately following the root, followed by modal and aspect
morphemes which are also included in the stem. Derivational, pronominal, and
clausal clitics attach to the verb stem, many of which have various segmental or
tonal allomorphs depending on the subject person or inflectional verb form to which
they attach. Gaahmg has morphological marking for both perfect and imperfect
aspect, which can both attach to completive and incompletive verbs. Tone is added
to verb stems for subject person inflection, tone distinguishes past from non-past
tense in the continuous form, and tone replacement is used in the formation of
antipassives, causatives, and verbal nouns.
Prepositions, body part locatives, adverbs, and conjunctions are distinct lexical
categories. Body part locatives are similar in form and meaning to inherently
possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category in that they do not
refer to person and have different tone than body part nouns. Although they are
separate morphemes, some of these locatives undergo the same segmental and tonal
alternations as clitics, depending on the final segments of the preceding noun of
reference.
Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb forms are
syntactically and morphologically distinct and combine in nearly all possible ways.","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318]"

The certainty of an action taking place is marked in the clause rather than on the
verb. There are two degrees of certainty or evidentiality for both completive and
incompletive verbs.
The normal completive form by itself is a statement of certainty. It states that it is
certain the action is completed. Uncertainty in the completive form is indicated by
the particle lā and optionally by the clause-final subordinate clitic =É. Both
degrees of certainty in the completive are shown in (59).

before the subject pronoun.
Similarly, the incompletive verb by itself is also a statement of certainty. It states
that it is certain the action is ongoing or for certain will be ongoing. Adding the
uncertainty particle lā before the incompletive verb or attaching the clause-final
subordinate clitic =É indicates uncertainty in the future. With either marker, the
other marker is optional.

14.9.1 Word order in the noun phrase
The noun phrase can be diagrammed in the order of (65). The head noun is followed
by an optional possessive pronoun (POS), and one or more optional adjectives. More
than one adjective in the same noun phrase is rare and no prescribed order in the
noun phrase can be determined. It is also possible for demonstratives (DEM) to
precede alienable possessive pronouns. The possessors of inalienable nouns—
kinship terms and body parts—precede the possessed noun, and the possessors of
alienable nouns follow the noun.
(65)Noun phrase word order
NP->(POSInalienable)N(POSAlienable)({DEM, NUM, ADJQuan, ADJQual})The adjectival clause of (66a) shows a noun phrase with three adjectives—a
demonstrative, numeral, and adjective of quality. The possessive pronoun ə́nə̀gg=ə̀
‘mine=COP’ is a noun phrase complement of the non-verbal adjectival clause and the
copula clitic is attached. In (b), the second singular possessive pronoun ɔ́ ‘your’
precedes the kinship term yáā ɲāā ‘aunt, younger mother (lit. mother girl)’—a
compound noun phrase, which is followed by a demonstrative.

(d), the third plural possessive pronoun ə́nə̀gg ‘my’ follows the plural alienable noun
bààlgā ‘instrument’. A demonstrative, possessive pronoun, and quantitative
adjective are all present in the same noun phrase, where the demonstrative precedes
the pronoun, possibly being fronted for emphasis.
Constructions with relative clauses are preferred above long noun phrases with
multiple adjectives. In (67), the relativisor nà begins three separate relative clauses.

Adjectives, possessive pronouns, and demonstratives agree with nouns in number.
Agreement is marked by the geminate velar segment gg or tone change. The plural
adjective suffix -gg is shown in (68a-b) and the possessive pronouns ə́nə̀gg and
ə̄yə̀gg are shown in (c-d). In (e-f), High tone in the demonstratives indicates a
singular noun and Low a plural noun.

the possessed noun and preceding the possessor. The possessor is in genitive casekālg

There is morphological marking in subordinate and interrogative clauses, and a
discussion of sentence-level syntax is needed to understand these morphemes. In
this chapter, we discuss types of clauses in sentences (15.1), coordinating and
subordinating conjunctions (15.2), interrogative structures (15.3), as well as focus
(15.4).","[301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"

spoken in the Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan, near the
Ethiopian border. For centuries, the Gaahmg people have fought off invaders
entering their hills. Even today, their culture and language have been less influenced
by outsiders than those of other ethnic groups in the Blue Nile Province. Although
Gaahmg speakers outnumber speakers of other languages in the area, little
documentation has been done of their language. This work presents a description of
Gaahmg grammar, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"1.3The current researchThe current research was conducted beginning in 2003 with speakers living in
Khartoum. From April 2004-April 2008 the author continued field work in
Khartoum as a language research associate of the University of Khartoum, Institute
of African and Asian studies. The primary language resource persons for this period
were Hashim Orta Adaw Madal, Safadin Hamid Ateeb, and Annaim Karaka
Farajalla Yasin. All three are from the town of Soda, have spoken the Jog Tao
dialect from childhood, and continue to speak it whenever they are with other
speakers of the language. After April 2008, access to speakers was limited to two
three-week trips to Kurmuk in southern Blue Nile Province, near the home area.
The primary language resource person for this trip was Annaim Karaka Farajalla
Yasin.
The original data set of nouns and verbs were taken from word lists entered into
dictionary software by speakers of the language, which became the Gaahmg-English
Dictionary (Madal 2004). The singular and plural forms of nouns and subjunctive
and completive forms of verbs were written on cards and glossed in English and
Arabic. The cards were sorted numerous times to isolate segments and tone in the
same environments, and each time speakers read the words on the cards.
Texts were recorded on cassette, transcribed, and glossed by speakers of the
language, the recordings made from a variety of individuals in the home area.
Natural clauses were taken from the texts as frames for eliciting nouns and verbs
with various morphemes. The cards were again used to elicit multiple nouns, verbs,
and adjectives in the frames.
The data set on which the thesis is based contains 700 nouns, 150 verbs, 40
adjectives, and a handful of other parts of speech. There are 16 texts of about 30
interlinearized pages that have been collected. These consist of folk narratives,
historical narratives, personal narratives, persuasive texts, and poetic genres. Ten of
these texts are presented in chapter 17.",[19]
"20A grammar of GaahmgIn chapter 9, the verb stem is discussed which is composed of the root and optional
slots for antipassive, causative, and modal or aspect morphemes. Aspect is marked
segmentally in the verb word—by completive and continuous suffixes. Past tense is
marked by tone on the verb stem—High tone on the non-past continuous suffix and
MH tone on the past continuous suffix. Infinitive, subjunctive and imperative forms
also add suffixes to the root. Deictic suffixes for each verb aspect and mode are also
attached to the root. Finite verb forms are inflected for subject person by tone added
to the stem-final syllable: High tone in third singular verbs, Low tone in third plural
verbs, and Mid tone in first and second person verbs. Chapter 10 discusses the
clitics of the verb word, including agented passive, passive, object and dative bound
pronouns, imperfect, perfect, subordinate, and relative clause definite marker clitics.
Clause-level syntax is presented in chapter 14 to show the functions of morphemes.
Agented passive, passive, antipassive, and causative morphemes are syntactically
distinguished in a section on verbal valency. Non-verbal clauses with two sets of
copulas are compared. Relative clauses, noun phrase agreement, and possession are
also discussed, among other grammatical aspects. Chapter 15 presents sentencelevel syntax, including coordinate and subordinate conjunctions, question clauses,
and subject and object focus. After some concluding remarks in chapter 16, ten
texts of various genres are presented in chapter 17 to verify the morphology and
syntax in the context of natural language.
All data represent both underlying and surface (phonetic) forms unless otherwise
marked. Where they differ, surface forms are written between brackets [ ], whereas
underlying forms are written between forward slashes / /. Many of the clause
examples are taken from the ten texts of chapter 17, which have reference codes.
Throughout the thesis, examples from these texts list the reference code and line
number in the free gloss from which the examples are taken. Pronouns, as in ūgg
ŋə̀lg ‘your (2pPp) necks,’ have a different set of gloss abbreviations than other word
categories (see the list of abbreviations and the discussion on possessive pronoun
abbreviations in 5.1).
Example numbers are indicated with parentheses such as (3), whereas rules are
indicated with braces such as {M3}. In 3.3, rule {M4} states that [+round] quality
spreads rightward from the root to all suffix vowels not underlying specified for the
feature [round]. However, roundness does not spread as specified in every word
with every speaker, but tends to vary from word to word and from speaker to
speaker. In this thesis, morphemes are transcribed as having the most possible
rounding.","[20, 21]"

The subordinate marking in the clause occurs along with these conjunctions as a
clitic on the verb, or clause finally, or both. It is more common for the conjunction
ār ‘if’ to be absent from the clause than to be present, although there is subordinate
marking regardless. As shown in 10.7, the verb-final subordinate clitic attached in
‘if’ clauses differs in tone from the clitic attached to verbs of other subordinate
clauses.
In (5c), the conjunction wàr ‘but’ occurs along with the verb-final subordinate clitic
=ī (SBO3). In (d), the conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ occurs along with the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) and the clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO). In

Questions are constructed using the question marker à or an interrogative pronoun.
Only the interrogative pronouns of (6b-e) agree in number with the noun phrase
which they replace. Some interrogative pronouns have a marked form when they
replace words which occur in an uncommon position in the clause, but are otherwise
unmarked. Other interrogative pronouns only have one form regardless of its
position in the clause. When any of the interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, the
clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) of 7.7 and 8.3.8 attaches sentence-finally.
When an interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) of 10.7 is attached to the verb.

The question marker à indicates a question with a yes/no response and can mark
non-verbal or verbal question clauses. This section discusses how it is used in nonverbal questions and section 15.3 presents its use in verbal questions. Question
clauses have the same construction as equivalent declarative clauses except for the
question marker.
The question marker for non-verbal clauses is most commonly clause-final. The
question marker à is independent from stems, evidenced by lack of [ATR] quality
change in the question marker in (44b).","[294, 295]"

‘The Baggara (people group) were kidnapping young girls.’ (Minj2)As shown in (5), verb complements—objects and indirect objects—immediately
follow the verb, and adjuncts follow verb complements. Adverbs are least
connected with the verb and the most moveable of the adjuncts, sometimes being
fronted before the verb, although not usually before the subject. When more than
one kind of adverb is present, manner and directional adverbs normally precede
adverbs of place, time, and other adverbs. Negation markers can be analyzed as
adverbs, since they follow the verb and its adjuncts and have the same function as
adverbs. They are always sentence-final and cannot be fronted before the verb as
some adverbs can.

the adverb ɟɔ̄ ‘only’. In (b), the verb is followed by the locative phrase mɔ̄sɔ̀r ɔ̄ɔl̄

It was a joy to study the Gaahmg language, in part because it is a fascinating
language, but also because of the kind assistance I received along the journey.
I am deeply indebted to my committee, Prof. Dr. M.P.G.M. (Maarten) Mous and Dr.
M.G. (Maarten) Kossmann. Working with them has been rewarding and a pleasure.
I want to thank Prof. Th.C. Schadeberg for his thoughtful comments on my thesis, as
well as thank the other readers. I also want to express my thanks to Dr. Leoma
Gilley, who was a mentor to me, gave me comments on several Gaahmg papers, and
was the first to encourage me to pursue a PhD. My thanks also to Dr. Constance
Kutsch Lojenga and Dr. Thomas E. Payne, for their time and input on portions of
my thesis.
I express deep appreciation to the Gaahmg people who shared with me their
beautiful language. Hashim Orta Adaw Madal made arrangements for me to work
with language speakers, travelled with me to the Gaahmg home area, and introduced
me to his family and home. Annaim Karaka Farajalla Yasin was an enormous help
in data collection, tirelessly producing paradigms and checking data. He
demonstrated love and careful thought of his language, and always seemed to
understand why I was probing for certain data. My thanks also to Safadin Hamid
Ateeb who faithfully assisted in data collection. There are many other language
speakers who assisted in other ways to whom I don’t know how to adequately
express my thanks.
The Institute of African and Asian Studies of Khartoum University granted me
permission to conduct the research in Khartoum. I want to especially thank Prof. Dr.
Al-Amin Abu-Manga for his kind assistance in making my research possible. I also
want to thank the Government of South Sudan who granted me permission to
conduct research on two trips to Kurmuk, in the southern Blue Nile province.
I am thankful for the support and friendship of my SIL colleagues who fielded
questions or otherwise encouraged me in the research. I wish to acknowledge the
love, support, encouragement, and prayers of my parents, who have always stood
with me. I am also indebted to my siblings, extended family, and friends for their
encouragement and support. I am deeply grateful to my wife Toni, who was one of
my strongest supporters from the beginning of the research.
Finally, I thank God with a heart full of gratitude, for He is surely my help, and “the
One who sustains me” (Psalms 54:4).","[3, 4, 5, 6]"
"9.2InfinitiveInfinitives are the most common form used in foregrounded nuclear clauses of
narratives, i.e. sequences of events. As such, they often encode actions that can be
translated into English as past tense, such as in (11). Infinitives commonly occur
following the infinitive verb dɔ̄ɔs̀ ‘start’ as in (11a), but can follow various other
verb forms and can be the first verb of a clause or sentence.

outAs such, infinitives are used in finite sentences. As discussed in 9.3, subjunctive
verbs are commonly used in typical non-finite contexts such as ‘want to X’.
Infinitive forms differ from finite forms in that they do not change with subject
person, either in tone or [ATR] quality. Also, the subject pronouns preceding an
infinitive verb differ from those of other verb forms. Singular pronouns of such
verbs all have Mid tone and plural pronouns have Low tone. Also, second person
pronouns are not clitics prefixed to the infinitive verbs, evidenced by the fact that
they do not take the [ATR] quality of the verb. Because of these differences with
other verb forms which change according to the subject person, this form which
does not change with the subject is analyzed as the infinitive.

All root-final consonants-CInfinitive verbs generally surface the same as the root. Since plosives and
approximants are not weakened word-finally in accordance with {P1b} of 2.1.3, it is
posited that a copied final consonant is added to the underlying-final segment which
surfaces as a single segment. Roots with final n as in (13h) optionally surface
without the final consonant and then with a lengthened vowel, in accordance with
{P4} in 2.3.3. Vowel-final roots add the segment -d̪ as in (o) or do not add any
suffix as in (p). It is possible that the vowel-final verb of (o) used to have final d̪
and that the vowel-final verb of (p) used to have final n, since these segments
optionally surface in some forms of the verb as will be seen in following sections.

which indicate the purpose of a nuclear (main) clause. These verbs are introduced
by a subject pronoun or by the subjunctive particle ā ‘to’. Subjunctives are common
following imperative verbs such as in (14a). They may have a different subject than
that of the previous verb, as seen in (c).

‘ . . (but) the goat I am giving to the old men to eat.’ (Jooj12)Regardless of what grammatical verb form the subjunctive follows, it has the same
segmental form. In (a) it follows a verb, in (b) an incompletive verb, and in (c) a
continuous form.
Subjunctive verbs add the suffix -d̪A to the root, except in first and second singular
person forms, where other suffixes can sometimes be added depending on the rootfinal segments. A subject pronoun with Mid tone introduces the subjunctive verb.
Plural pronouns before such verbs do not have the plural marker -gg, and second
person pronouns are optionally [+/- ATR] regardless of the [ATR] quality of the root
vowel. The subjunctive particle ā is an optional alternative for introducing third
person subjunctive verbs, as shown in (14b,c).

In (16), first and third singular subjunctive forms with each of the root-final
consonants are given. As in (i-k), first singular subjunctive verbs with root-final b, ɟ,
g attach the suffix -CA where C has the same features as the root-final consonant.
As in (f-g), first singular forms with root-final approximants w and y attach the
suffix -(n)(A) and the underlying approximant surfaces as a vowel, as will be
explained shortly. The suffix-initial -n is sometimes elided, and when this happens,
the approximant remains a vowel. As in (o), first singular subjunctives with rootfinal vowel add the same suffix as in third singular subjunctives -d̪(A), except that
the vowel is optional, or add the suffix -n(a) as in (p). First singular subjunctives
with other root-final segments optionally attach the suffix -(A).

‘say’Third singular subjunctives have various alternations which are only attested in verb
morphology. Those of (16a-d) undergo a coronal assimilation process. The rootfinal coronal consonants d̪, s, n, ð take on all the features of the suffix-initial
coronal d̪. In 9.5, it will be seen how the same root-final segments assimilate to the
initial s of the completive suffix -sA.
The third singular subjunctive forms of (16d-f) also undergo an assimilation process.
The suffix-initial dental plosive assimilates to ð, r, and w. There are two forms for
plural subjunctives with root-final ð as in (d): the root-final consonant either
assimilates to the suffix consonant as in fɛ́d-̪ d̪ā ‘release’, or the suffix consonant
assimilates to the root-final consonant as in fɛ́ð-ðā ‘release’. In (g), the suffix-Verb stem morphology183initial plosive may also assimilate to the underlying approximant y (kɔ́y.-yá) which
weakens to the vowel ɛ after the suffix vowel a is elided (kɔ́ɛ.́ -ɛ́). This assimilation
process to the root-final ð, r, and w does not always apply for every word with every
speaker, but varies from word to word and from speaker to speaker.
Rule {P1b} in section 2.1.3 states that /b/, /ɟ/, /w/, /y/ are weakened word-finally to
vowels with the same [ATR] quality as the preceding vowel. The same weakening
process occurs syllable-finally before a consonant-initial suffix, provided that the
underlying root-final consonant is not the same as the suffix-initial consonant. In
the third singular subjunctive forms of (f-i), b becomes ɔ (àɔ̀-d̪ɔ̀ ‘sit’), ɟ becomes ɛ
(káɛ́-d̪ā ‘bring’), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ d̪ɔ ́ ‘cook’)
before the consonant-initial suffix -d̪A. The [+round] feature spread to the suffix
vowel as in ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’ is further support of the root-final segment weakening
to a vowel. Similarly, in the first singular forms of (f-g), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-nɔ́
‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ nɔ́ ‘cook’) before the consonant-initial suffix -n(A).
However, b,ɟ do not become ɔ,ɛ in the first singular forms àb-bà ‘sit’, káɟ-ɟā ‘bring’
of (h-i), and w does not become ɔ in the third singular form ɲáw-wā ‘request’ of (f),
since the suffix-initial consonant has become the same as the underlying root-final
consonant.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"
"9.11 Causative
A causative verb is used to indicate the reason or initiative of the action being a
different argument than that which does the action. In other words, it expresses that
there is an external causer and adds an argument to the clause. In the causative
continuous form of (60a) with causative suffix -d̪+A, the subject verbal noun tī̪ f ə᷇n
‘tying’ causes the būŋu᷇rgə́ ‘youth’ to sit. The root verb /káàm/ ‘work’ in the
causative completive form of (b) with suffix -s+A means ‘bother’. In (c), the simple
completive verb cúrsū ‘tie’ is compared with the causative completive form of the
same verb cu᷇rsū ‘tie’ in (d), which functions as a speech act of giving a command.
Although the causative completive suffix -s+A attaches in (d), the only difference is
a tone change on the root.

"1.1Gaahmg languageAt the request of speakers, the name of the language is written orthographically with
the grapheme /aah/ for the long vowel [əə]. The language name is pronounced
[gə̀ə̀mg], meaning ‘people of the Gaam or Ingessana Hills’. Other names for the
language include Ingessana, Gaam, and Tabi. Ingessana is a name given by Arabs.
Gaam is the word for hill, and Tabi is a hill name in the home area (Bender 1980:4).
Gaahmg is classified as a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language. Greenberg was
the first to list Tabi (Gaahmg) as a separate branch of the Eastern Sudanic subfamily (1955:62). Bender proposed that Gaam belongs to an Eastern Jebel Family
including the languages Aka, Molo, Kelo, and Ben Sheko which all have a first
singular pronoun with the segment n and other similarities. He added that the total
number of speakers of Eastern Jebel languages other than Gaam speakers probably
does not exceed 2,000 (Bender 1998:39).
The Ethnologue states there are 67,200 Gaahmg speakers, who mainly live in the
Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province (Gordon 2005), bordering Ethiopia to the
east. There are four dialects: Jog Tao (Soda area), Buwag (southeast area), Kulag
(Bao area), and Jog Goor (northwest area). The first two are more closely related to
each other, and the last two to each other. Although the dialects are distinct enough
phonetically and lexically to identify a person as from the dialect area, they are
easily understood from one to another (Jedrej 1995: 32). The teachers, politicians
and other educated people mostly come from the Jog Tao dialect, which is analyzed
in this thesis.
There are three published linguistic works on the language that predate the research
of this author: Ethnographical Observations in Dar Fung by E. E. Evans-Pritchard
(1932), The Phonological Features of the Ingessana Language by W. J. Crewe
(1975), and Preliminary Gaam-English-Gaam Dictionary by M. L. Bender & Malik
Agaar Ayre (1980).",[16]
"318A grammar of GaahmgIn non-verbal clauses, copular clitics may take the place of separate copula particles,
which are functionally equivalent but differ in form. Relative clauses are
morphologically marked for definiteness and grammatical function in place of the
marking on the head noun they modify. Subordinate clauses are morphologically
marked clause-finally, and the verbs of subordinate clauses can also be marked
according to the type of subordinate clause. Interrogative clauses attach the agented
passive when an agent is post-verbal, the clause-final subordinate when any of the
interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, and the verb-final subordinate when an
interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal.","[318, 319]"

Nouns function as subjects, objects, indirect objects, or objects of prepositional
phrases. In (1), mɛ̀ɛn̄ ‘youth’ has the role of agent and functions as the subject of
the clause. The noun nāmsá ‘food’ has the role of a theme, functioning as an object,
whereas mə̄əð̄ ə́n ‘grandfather’ is the recipient and indirect object.

A Grammar of Gaahmg, a Nilo-Saharan Language of Sudan
door Timothy M. Stirtz
1. In Gaahmg, personal pronouns use vowel features to represent the person referred to,
the three persons coinciding with the language's three vowel harmony pairs.
2. Gaahmg has body part locatives which are similar in form and meaning to inherently
possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category. Unlike inherently
possessed body part nouns, they do not have person reference and differ in tone.
3. Gaahmg has morphological marking for both perfect and imperfect aspect, which can
both attach to completive and incompletive verbs.
4. In Gaahmg, tone replacement is used in the formation of genitives, antipassives,
causatives, and verbal nouns.
5. A fortis/lenis consonant contrast in word-initial and intervocalic position is common
in Southwest Surmic languages (De Jong 2004:145), but the word-initial contrast
does not exist in the Surmic language called Laarim (Narim) of Sudan.
6. There are five case suffixes in Laarim (Surmic) which have polar tone—opposite
tone from the stem-final tone.
7. Lumun, a Niger-Congo Kordofanian language of Sudan, uses pronouns and noun
concord reference to distinguish one participant as being more important than another.
8. In Lumun narratives with one participant being more important than all others, the
centers of orientation for direction words are locations that change according to the
movement of that participant.
9. It is ideal and possible to both analyze an African language and train speakers in the
grammar of their language at the same time.
10. Linguistic analysis of African languages opens new doors of amazing beauty which
inspires a person to look more outside himself at the world around him.","[352, 353]"
"15.1 Clause combinations
Clauses may be nuclear (main, independent), pre-nuclear (dependent clause
preceding a nuclear clause), or post-nuclear (dependent clause following a nuclear
clause).
As in (1a), foregrounded nuclear clauses of narrative texts most commonly use
infinitive verbs. However, in non-fiction narratives, a completive verb is also
common, as shown in (b).

big.sizePre-nuclear clauses are introduced with subordinate conjunctions, the most common
of which is the conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ which often introduces tail-head linkage.
In the second line of (2), the subordinate clause refers to ‘an arrival at the well’
implied by the previous nuclear clause, before continuing with the next nuclear
clause in the third line. In this way, the subordinate clause links new information
with old information contained in the subordinate clause. The verbs of tail-head
linkage are most commonly completive verbs, but can also be incompletive or pastcontinuous.

subjunctive verb as in (b). In (b), three subjunctive verbs in three separate postnuclear clauses are introduced by the subjunctive particle ā and give the purpose of
the nuclear clause. A further subjunctive clause (ā mād̪ɛ ́ fɛ̄gg ‘to drink water’) is
found in the first two lines of (2). Clauses may also be embedded such as the clause
fɛ̄gg-á ɛ̄ nāā ɛ́ fɔ̄l tə̪ d́ ̪-ì ‘water lay down in the hole’ of the final line of (2) which is a
complement of the verb gə̄ms-ə́ggə̄ ‘found’.

DEF15.2 Conjunctions
Conjunctions are a further lexical category, introducing either nuclear or non-nuclear
(subordinate) clauses. The coordinate conjunctions of (4) are found to introduce
nuclear clauses. Some references in texts from chapter 17 are listed for theSentence-level syntax309conjunctions. In addition, it is also possible to juxtapose nuclear clauses without any
conjunction.

"The syntax is equally interesting. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb forms are syntactically and morphologically distinct
and combine in nearly all possible ways. All pronouns use vowel features to
represent the person referred to, the three persons coinciding with the language’s
three vowel harmony pairs. Body part locatives are similar in form and meaning to inherently possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category
in form and function.
These and other features make the description a valuable resource for NiloSaharan linguists as well as those interested in the typology of African languages.",[1]
"775PronounsThe pronoun system in Gaahmg distinguishes three persons, two numbers (singular
and plural), and six cases (possessive, subject, object, dative, reflexive,
prepositional). There is no dual, no gender distinction, no inclusive/exclusive
distinction, and no logophoric distinction. As expected in an SVO language, subject
pronouns are pre-verbal and object and dative pronouns are post-verbal. Possessive
pronouns are pre-nominal for inalienable nouns and post-nominal for alienable
nouns. Prepositional pronouns have the prepositional marker prefix d̪- and reflexive
pronouns make use of the possessed noun ‘body’.
There are two distinct ways that pronouns affect verbs through [ATR] quality:
second person subject morphemes require verb forms to have [+ATR] vowel quality
as discussed in 5.3, and dative suffixed pronouns spread [+ATR] vowel quality
leftward onto the verb root {M3}, as discussed in 5.5.
The six types of pronouns are each discussed in their own section, but first, an
explanation is needed for the vowel-person correspondence in all pronouns.
Interrogative pronouns are not discussed in this chapter, but in 15.3 in the chapter on
sentence level syntax.","[77, 78]"

"178A grammar of GaahmgThe chart of (10) summarizes the criteria for determining which verb bound
morphemes are suffixes and thus a part of the stem, and which verb bound
morphemes are clitics and thus outside of the stem, but part of the word. The perfect
=r and relative clause definite clitics are attested to attach to more than one word
category, as shown in chapter 4. All clitics with the exception of the verbal noun
clitics can attach to all inflectional suffixes. Many of the clitics are attested to attach
to the surface-final segments of stems as will be verified in the various sections of
chapter 1032. Finally, one or more rules {M1-11} are not applied to some of the
verb clitics, as will be summarized in 10.1 and later shown in the various sections.
Although the four criteria are not all valid for any one clitic, none of these criteria
are valid for any of the suffixes. Thus, they each individually lend support of the
clitics being a different kind of morpheme than the suffixes.

The singular body part locatives ɛ́ɛ́lg ‘in’, ɔ́ɔ́l ‘above’, ááɲ/ɛ́ɛ́ɲ ‘behind’ have
underlying High tone and the plural body part locatives íìlg ‘in’, úùlg ‘above’, ə́ə̀ɲg
‘behind’ have underlying HL tone. Regardless of whether the locatives attach to
nouns, initial High tone of the locative is lowered to Mid following noun-final Low
tone, as shown by (14-19).

Another lexical category—adverbs, describes the action of the clause, the clause
predicate or the entire clause. There is a strong case for both adjectives and adverbs;
different modifiers are normally used to describe verbs than those used to describe
nouns. The adjective wɛ᷇d̪án ‘good.SG’ of (1a) cannot be used in (b) to describe the
verb fīŋə́-d̪ə ̄ ‘hear’, and the adverb mâŋ ‘well’ of (b) cannot be used to describe the
noun sālāām ‘peace’ in (a). Furthermore, the adjective wɛ᷇dá̪ n agrees in number with
the noun it modifies, whereas the adverb maŋ is unchangeable, and therefore not a
noun or any other word category with number distinction.

‘Let them hear this message well!’ (Womn25)In this chapter, all attested words are presented which have the function of
describing the action of the clause, the clause predicate or the entire clause. These
words which are lexically categorized as adverbs can be grouped semantically
according to manner, direction, place, time, or none of these. Adverbs of manner,
direction, and place always follow the verb, whereas other adverbs are moveable
outside of the verb phrase and may occur before the verb. When more than one kind
of adverb is present, it is most common for manner and directional adverbs to
precede adverbs of place, time, and other adverbs. The negative particle can also be
analysed as an adverb since it has the same function as adverbs and always occurs
clause-finally.","[270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"

Second and third person object pronouns are clitics attached to verb stems, whereas
first person object pronouns are analyzed as separate morphemes since they do not
undergo changes in [ATR] quality. As presented in 5.4, the unmarked object
pronouns are relisted in (27). Several person object pronouns have tonal allomorphs
which are discussed in the following section on object pronoun tonal morphology.

3pAFirst person pronouns have back unrounded [-ATR] vowels which do not become
[+ATR] regardless of the root they follow. Thus they are analyzed as separate
morphemes. When first person object pronouns follow verb stems with suffixes
such as the completive forms cɔ̄r-sá ‘help-COMP’, cúr-sú ‘tie-COMP’ of (28), the
stem-final vowel is elided and the tone of the verb root spreads to the object
pronoun, just as if the first person object were a clitic as the other object pronouns.
In 12.1, it is shown that independent body part locatives sometimes have elided
vowels and tone changes similar to clitics. The first person object pronouns are no
more unusual in their alternations than these body part locatives.

genitive case which is marked by a tone change. In such clauses, the semantic
patient or theme (syntactic subject), encoded as a noun in (a) or pronoun as in (b), is
pre-verbal.

‘It (goat) was given by the person.’We now compare marked and unmarked objects and syntactic subjects (semantic

plural subjects with third singular and plural objects. Clauses which compare the
grammatical structures are first shown in (32), and the resulting verb forms which
compare the morphemes are shown in the chart of (33).
In each of the clauses of (32), a third singular subject is combined with a third
singular object. These grammatical structures are representative of the singular and
plural combinations of subjects and objects shown in the chart to follow. In (a), the
subject verb form has no object pronoun, in (b) the verb has an unmarked object

with their referent; the segment -gg- marks the plural object (bɛ̀l-d̪=ɛ̄ɛḡ gà
‘beat=3sN/3pA’, bɛ̄l-d̪=ɛ̄ɛg̀ gà ‘beat=3pN/3pA’). The different tonal allomorphs of
the objects predictably attach to different subject forms as further described in
10.4.2. In marked third object pronouns, the segment -gg- marks the plural object
(bīl-d̪=ììggə̀ ‘beat=3sN/3pAM’, bìl-d̪=íìggə̀ ‘beat=3pN/3pAM’) as well as a
singular object combined with a plural subject (bīld̪=īìggì ‘beat=3pN/3sAM’).
Again, the different tonal allomorphs of the objects predictably attach to different
subject forms. Syntactic pronoun subjects of agented passive clauses have the same
form as subjects of active clauses [ɛ̄(ɛ̄n) ‘he (3sN)’, ɛ̄ggà ‘they (3pN)’]. They are
independent and agree in number with the referent. For these pre-verbal patients or
themes, the agented passive verb clitic =E᷇ marks that a singular agent comes after
the verb and the suffix =ÉĒ marks that a plural agent comes after the verb.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"
"Introduction1.419Overview and notationsGaahmg is rich in morphology, particularly in nouns, adjectives, and verbs. To
correctly analyze the morphemes and their alternations, we also discuss their
phonological foundation and describe their syntactic environments.
The phonological description of chapter 2 includes distribution and contrasts of
phonemes, phonological rules, syllable structure, and a tonal description of roots.
Consonant weakening is common word-finally and intervocalically in roots and
across morpheme boundaries. A significant number of lexical distinctions as well as
distinctions in grammatical function are made exclusively by [ATR] harmony and
tone. Thus, the phonological analysis of these aspects is indispensable for the
morphological analysis.
Segmental and tonal morphophonological rules are presented in chapter 3. The vast
majority of the alternations when morphemes combine can be attributed to processes
described by these eleven rules. Clitics, having different alternations and functions
than suffixes, are shown in chapter 4 to attach to more than one word category. In
4.2, there are four other criteria discussed which can be used to distinguish suffixes
from clitics such as that suffixes attach to underlying forms of roots, whereas clitics
attach to surface forms of stems. In 4.3, we establish adjectives as a distinct lexical
category from nouns and verbs since they are not used in some of the syntactic
constructions of either nouns or verbs, and there are some differences in the
morphology when used as either category.
In chapters 5-13, word categories are presented. The morphology of nouns (chap. 67), adjectives (chap. 8), and verbs (chap. 9-10) are the heart of this thesis. Pronouns
(chap. 5), prepositions (chap. 11), body part locatives (chap. 12), and adverbs (chap
13) are the minor word categories described, which have little or no morphology.
In chapter 6, we see that nouns have singular and plural suffixes. Although the vast
majority of singular nouns do not have suffixes, plural marking is obligatory with
plural referents. There are several plural suffixes, each with different tonal
allomorphs, although most includes the segment gg. Most plural suffixes have no
semantic correlation with the nouns to which they attach, but the suffix attached
sometimes depends on the root-final segment.
As shown in chapter 7, noun stems may attach one or more of seven clitics: copular,
definite, locative copular, dative, accompaniment, subordinate, or relative clause
definite clitics. The clitics have different segmental or tonal allomorphs which
attach depending on the stem-final segment. In chapter 8, we show that adjectives
are similar to nouns in stem and word morphology. Most adjectives attach the plural
suffix -gg which is required on plural referents. The same seven clitics attaching to
nouns may also attach to adjectives.","[19, 20]"

notIn chapter 12, it is discussed how body part locatives can be used with nouns of
reference as in (34a) or with pronouns of reference as in (b). The latter is a special
kind of prepositional pronoun called a ‘locative prepositional pronoun’.

‘Fox jumped on his back.’Locative prepositional pronouns are often close in form to inherently possessed body
part nouns which do not occur without being possessed by someone (Payne
1997:105-106). As discussed in 5.2.4, speakers cannot say ‘back’, ‘hand’, ‘head’,
etc. without also including the possessor along with the noun (i.e. āāɲ ‘my.back’, ɔ̄ɔɲ̄
‘your.back’, ɛ̄ɛɲ̄ ‘his.back’, etc.). Although their vowels distinguish person as in
locative prepositional pronouns (d̪-ááɲ ‘behind-me’, d̪-ɔ́ɔɲ́ ‘behind-you’, d̪-ɛ́ɛɲ́
‘behind-him’), inherently possessed body parts such as ɛ̄ɛɲ̄ in (34c) have no
prepositional prefix d̪- and differ in tone than when used as locative prepositional
pronouns as in (34b). In chapter 12, it will be shown that body part locatives with
noun references such as (34a) of this section do not distinguish person and are thus a
distinct lexical category from possessed body part nouns. Since locative
prepositional pronouns have different tone than the respective body part nouns from
which they are taken, they are analyzed categorically as locatives rather than as
nouns with locative meaning through metaphorical extension. Further, since they
The body part locative ááɲ ‘behind’ can also be used to reference the third singular noun

High tone and third plural Low tone generally occur word-finally on adjectives,
second person Mid tone is not as regular on second plural forms, as second plural
forms of (b,c,h) have final Low tone. Further, second person [+ATR] quality is not
as regular as in true verbs, as second plural forms of (b,c,g) have [-ATR] quality
({M3} is not applied). Among the adjectival verbs attested, those of (95) are the
most regular in final segment alternations, tone and vowel quality. Others are even
more irregular.

Preposition is a lexical category including four independent prepositions and one
prepositional prefix. Prepositions introduce noun phrases which function as
modifiers or adjuncts of the preceding noun or verb. Four independent prepositions
can have the same segmental form ɛ but differ in tone or grammatical marking on
the prepositional phrase. The animate accompaniment preposition ɛ̀ ‘with’ has Low
tone, the inanimate preposition ɛ̄ ‘with’ has Mid tone, and the general preposition ɛ́,
í (GP) has High tone. The general preposition has free variation in vowel quality
regardless of the [ATR] quality of surrounding words. When the general preposition
is used to introduce a genitive phrase, the noun following the preposition undergoes
a tone change. The preposition marker prefix d̪- is used for introducing phrases with
initial pronouns.

The preposition ɛ̀ ‘with’ having Low tone is used for introducing animate
accompaniment phrases. In such phrases, the accompaniment marker clitic =E᷇
attaches to the final word of the accompaniment phrase. The accompaniment
marker =E᷇ for consonant-final stems is attached to the noun āld̪=ɛ᷇ ‘fox’ in (1a)

The preposition ɛ́, í ‘to, from, in, at, by’ introduces adjunct phrases that indicate
goal, time, location, or instrument/source. Goal phrases can be used along with a
following locative adverb t ̪ɛ ‘there’ as in (3a) or along with a preceding adverbial
locative d̪umuun ‘far’ as in (b). The first prepositional phrase ɛ́ nāānd̪á ‘in day’ of

This preposition is also used in the formation of two conjunctions: ɛ́ gārá ‘when,
while (lit. by place.DEF)’, ɛ́ kɔ̄rá ‘because (lit. by word.DEF)’. Conjunction is another
lexical category and discussed in 15.2. In 13.4, it will be shown that the general
preposition introduces prepositional phrases used as adjuncts indicating time ɛ́
nāānd̪=á yāàn ‘another day (lit. at day another)’.
The general preposition is also used to introduce genitive phrases which indicate
possession, or close relation of certain objects or actions. In such phrases, the noun
following the preposition undergoes a tone change and is the possessor of the noun
preceding the preposition, or is the noun to which the preceding noun is closely
related. In (4a), the ɲɛ̄ɛr̄ ɛ̄ma᷆=n ‘devil.GEN=DEF’ is the possessor of ɲālg ‘children’.
In (b), the word preceding the genitive phrase is a verb and the genitive phrase
functions as an adjunct. As discussed in 6.5, the tone of each genitive noun has
Mid-Low or High-Low, regardless of the root tone.

The consonant prefix d̪- is used instead of the independent general preposition ɛ́ (GP)
when marking prepositional phrases beginning with possessive pronouns,
prepositional pronouns, locative prepositional pronouns, or inherently possessed
body parts—all of which are vowel-initial.37
In (6a), the preposition attaches to the possessive pronoun ɛ̄ ‘his’ of the possessive
phrase to indicate ‘in his chest’. In (b), the preposition attaches to the prepositional
pronoun -a᷇ggá ‘us’ to indicate ‘from us’. In (c), the preposition attaches to the
locative prepositional pronoun -ɛ́ɛɲ́ ‘behind.3sO’ to indicate ‘to behind him’. In (d),
the preposition attaches to the possessed body part noun ɔ̄ɔɲ̄ to indicate ‘on your
back’. In (a,d), the prepositional phrases have the role of location, in (b) the role of
source, and in (c) the role of goal.

Some adverbs of direction have the syntactic function of prepositions, introducing a
noun phrase. In (7a), the adverb d̪ūmùùn ‘towards’ introduces the noun phrase
wāālg ‘water.source in’. Sometimes adverbs of direction introduce other adverbs of
direction as in (b), where the first adverb functions as a preposition, and the second
functions as a noun phrase. In both example (a) and (b), the prepositional phrase
functions as an adjunct, describing the location of the action.

Locative phrases can consist of a noun of reference followed by a body part
functioning as a locative, which in this thesis is called a ‘body part locative’. Body
part locatives are analyzed categorically as locatives in that the original body part
noun has become a grammaticalized form which no longer refers to person. In
5.2.4, it was shown that the vowels of inherently possessed body part nouns
correspond to the person possessing the nouns. Such body parts used as locatives
may have generalized first or second person vowels when used for the location of
third person nouns.

àn
ūfú
ɔ́ɔĺ

‘ . . as he remained in the tree.’ (Nyee35)In (1), ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ is a body part locative with the same segmental form as ɔ̄ɔl̄ ‘your
head (2sPs)’. The noun ɔ̄ɔl̄ ‘your head’ is a second person singular inherently
possessed singular body part requiring a person marker vowel. In contrast, the
locative ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ is used with the third singular noun ūfú ‘tree’, and the vowel ɔɔ no
longer refers to person. In this way, the body part has become grammaticalized as a
locative rather than as a body part. The second person vowel of the locative form
ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ is random in that other body part locatives use first person or third person
vowels.
As will be discussed in 14.9.3, possession of body part nouns is different than for
other nouns in that the possessor precedes the body part (ɟɛ̄n lúd̪ ‘person’s leg’)
instead of following and in the genitive case (gàd̪ááɛ̀ ɛ́ ɟɛ̂n ‘basket of person.GEN’).
The construction of locative phrases with body part locatives resembles that of
possessed body parts—the body part follows the possessor and the body part
locative follows the noun of reference. However, since ɔ́ɔĺ ‘up’ and other singular
body part locatives can describe the location of any singular person noun or
pronoun, the locative is a grammaticalized form which no longer refers to any
person.
In (2), body part nouns and the corresponding body part locatives are listed in both
singular and plural forms along with their meanings. All body part locatives have
the same segmental form as the corresponding body part noun; however, locatives
(a-c) which are inherently possessed body parts have different tone than the
corresponding body part nouns. Locatives which are inherently possessed body
parts include a person marker vowel only because the body part cannot occur
without one. The person marker vowel does not represent any person in its locative
usage unless the prepositional prefix d̪- is attached, as discussed shortly. As to
which of the three vowel-person forms the grammticalized body part employs,
appears random. The locative of (a) uses the third person vowel, the locative of (b)266A grammar of Gaahmguses the second person vowel, and the locative of (c) can use either the first or third
person vowel in singular locative form, but only the first person vowel in plural
form.

beneathWhen body part locatives are used with pronouns of reference instead of nouns of
reference, the object pronoun is attached to the verb and the prepositional prefix d̪‘to’ attaches to the body part locative, as will be discussed in 11.4. Body part
locatives with pronominal reference are also called locative prepositional pronouns,
as discussed in 5.7.
In (4), the third singular object pronoun =ì attaches to the verb. The prepositional
prefix d̪- marks the body part locative as indicating a pronoun as well as a location,Body part locatives267and thus the vowel ɛɛ indicates the third person singular pronoun (d̪-ɛ́ɛɲ́ ‘to behind
him’).

‘Fox jumped behind him.’ (Goat12)If instead the meaning were ‘Fox jumped behind (over) you’, the construction d̪-ɔ́ɔɲ́
(PP-behind.2sO; locative prepositional pronoun) would have been used. If the
meaning were ‘Fox jumped on his back’ the construction d̪-ɛ̄ɛɲ̄ (PP-back.3sPs;
possessed body part) with Low tone would have been used [see also (6d) of 11.4]. If
the meaning were ‘Fox jumped behind the tree’, the construction pə̂rd̪ə ̄ ūfú ɛ́ɛɲ́
(jump tree behind; body part locative) would have been used.
Locative phrases are adjuncts of the verb and are equivalent in function to adverbs
of place such as tɛ̪ ‘there, here’ discussed in 13.3. However, since locative phrases
have a different construction than adverbs of place, they are analyzed as separate
lexical categories.
Although body part locatives are analyzed as separate morphemes, the initial vowels
of some body part locatives are sometimes elided, undergo [ATR] changes, and
undergo tone changes similar to those of clitics, depending on the nouns they follow.
A summary of these changes is given here with reference to the list of (5), and
examples follow in the next sections. Elision and [ATR] changes only occur in the
singular body part locative of (5a) and to a lesser extent in the singular locatives of
(b-c). The changes mostly depend on the speed of the utterance, but also on the final
segments of the nouns the locatives follow. Tonal changes in body part locatives
nearly always take place, regardless of the speed of utterance. However, there are
no tonal changes for the singular locative of (g) and the plural locatives of (d-g) with
underlying initial Low tone. The examples that follow represent fast speech and
demonstrate the most possible changes.

The verbal clitic =E᷇, =ÉĒ indicates a third person agent (or experiencer) encoded
post-verbally in a prepositional phrase or in genitive case. The clitic agrees in
number with the encoded agent when in genitive case but not when in a
prepositional phrase. The clitic is called an ‘agented passive (PAS.A)’ marker in this
thesis. It is commonly used when patients or themes are in focus, being pre-verbal.
In agented passive clauses, an explicit agent is required and the encoding of the
agent is required to be post-verbal. Further, the agent is marked as a non-argument,Verb word morphology215demoted to a prepositional phrase as in (a) or in genitive case as in (b), and thus no
longer the syntactic subject. The clauses of (c-d) have singular and plural agents
encoded in post-verbal positions, where the clitics =E᷇, =ÉĒ agree in number with
the agent. However, the clitic =E᷇ of (4a) does not agree in number with the plural
agent káɛ́ggà ‘witchdoctor’ in the prepositional phrase.

verbal valency in 14.5.1.

Third singular subject =E᷇

=ÉĒ10.2.1 Agented passive segmental morphology
Agented passive clitics are attached to verb stems. When the root is stem-final, such
as in incompletive forms, no segments are elided, even if the stem is vowel-final. In
this case, the clitic is juxtaposed to the stem (pāā.=ɛ᷇ ‘guard=PAS.A’) in accordance
with {M2} of 3.1. However, final vowels which are not part of the root, such as
suffix-final vowels in completive and subjunctive plural forms, are elided by the
initial vowel of agented passive clitics (cɔ̄r-sɔ́ ‘help-COMP.3sN’, cɔ᷄r-s=ɛ᷇ ‘helpCOMP=PAS.A’), in accordance with {M1} of 3.1.
In (7), third singular incompletive forms with agented passive clitic =E᷇ are shown
with various root-final segments. The clitic attaches to the surface-final segments of
the incompletive form rather than to the underlying form, as seen by the long vowels
in (c, h, o-p) when the clitic is juxtaposed to open syllables. In (b-c, l-m), the rootfinal segment can optionally surface as a vowel or an approximant.

The agented passive clitic =E᷇ has underlying HM tone. In (8), it is attached to third
singular completive and incompletive verbs, and in (9) it is attached to third singular
continuous past verbs. In completive and incompletive forms, the initial High tone
of the agented passive clitic becomes Mid following root-final Low tone {M9} as in
(c,d,f). For unknown reasons, completive and incompletive forms with Mid root
tone melody and agented passive clitic have MH tone on the root as in (8b), but not
in continuous past forms with Mid root tone melody as in (9b).

syllables of suffixes, Mid tone is inserted between them on the first of the two
syllables. Thus, Mid tone is added to the continuous past suffix in (9b,c) but not on
other forms where there is an initial Mid or Low tone preceding the High on the
continuous suffix.

In contrast with the agented passive of 10.2, which always has an explicit agent in
the clause, the passive of this section never encodes an agent. Passive and active
forms are compared in (12). In the normal SVO word order of active transitive
clauses such as (a-b, d), the noun preceding the verb is the subject and agent. In (b),
the L-M tone (with L-H becoming L-M by {M9}) of the completive form indicates
the third singular subject while L-L tone would indicate a third plural subject. In
passive clauses such as (c,e), the clitic =ĀnÁ indicates that an implied agent is
absent from the clause. In that case, the patient (syntactic subject) normally
precedes the verb as in (c) but may follow the verb as in (e) and in (13). The clitic
=ÁnÁ attaches to stems with vowel-final suffixes such as the completive forms of
(c,e) and the clitic =Á attaches to stems with consonant-final suffixes such as the
continuous past form of (13) and to suffix-less stems.","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"

of lexemes and grammatical functions. Several specific processes of consonant
weakening, vowel elision, [+ATR] spreading, [+round] spreading, and morphological tone rules, account for the vast majority of alternations when morphemes
are combined.",[1]
"Clitics and word structure75verbs. Adjectives are attested to fill the same slot in a clause as verbs in the
constructions of (34). Many adjectives such as kāyáár ‘beautiful’ have the same
morphology as verbs for completive and continuous suffixes.

adjectival verbs of plural persons, whereas these bound morphemes are not attached

3pNThe adjectival verb kāyáār of (35) has subject tone inflection (final Mid for second
person, final High for third singular, and final Low for third plural) and [+ATR]
second person forms, as do true verbs. However, in some adjectives used as verbs,
person inflection is not as regular as the adjectival verb paradigm in (35). Second
plural forms of some adjectival verbs have Low final tone instead of Mid (kɔ́ɔf́ àr,
kúúfə̀r-g=ə̀ ‘thin.INCP-2pN=COP’) and second person forms of some adjectival
verbs have [-ATR] quality instead of [+ATR] (bánd̪āl, bánd̪āl-g=ā ‘weak.INCP2pN=COP’). These features mark adjectives as being different than true verbs.
Since adjectives have some differences in syntax and morphology compared to both
nouns and verbs, they are analyzed as a separate category. Adjective clitic
morphology similar to that of noun morphology is presented in 8.3, whereas76A grammar of Gaahmgadjective morphology similar to verb morphology is presented in 10.11.
In the following chapters, word categories are discussed one-by-one. For each, we
first discuss the function followed by the forms of morphemes attached to roots or
stems. Because possessive pronouns are important for the discussion on nouns and
verbs, pronouns in general are discussed first, followed by nouns, adjectives, verbs,
prepositions, locatives, and adverbs. Each of these is a lexical category, as are
conjunctions discussed in 15.2.","[75, 76, 77]"

In this thesis, the term ‘perfect’ discussed in 10.8 is used for verbs with a past or
present action that remains or results in the present or future. The imperfect is
simply the counterpart of such verbs. Namely, imperfect verbs indicate that a past
or present action does not remain or result in the present or future. It should not be
confused with imperfective aspect, which in other languages indicates an ongoing
process. In (54a), the subjunctive imperfect verb indicates that although the goat
will drink water, he will at some time become thirsty and need to drink again. In
(b), the continuous past imperfect verb indicates that at the time the narrative takes
place, the Baggara had horses, but may no longer have horses at the time the
narrative is told. There is similar meaning for the incompletive imperfect verbs of
(c-d). In the interrogative and declarative clauses in hortatory genre of (e), the
incompletive imperfect verbs are used as habituals.

"6.2.5One-form lexemesThere are both singular nouns without plural forms and plural nouns without
singular forms. These nouns are morphologically similar to other singular and plural
nouns, and adjectives agree in number with them.
The singular nouns of (29) do not have corresponding plural forms and can be
modified by singular adjectives. They are referents found as single items, things
found in quantities, abstract ideas, or items difficult to count. The list is not
exhaustive but representative of the approximately 15% of nouns without plural

"Whereas the phonological rules apply to all relevant environments in a word, the

morphemes combining. All rules in this section apply in several bound morphemes,
often including both suffixes and clitics in both nouns and verbs. However,
morphophonological rules are not applied to two noun clitics (COP, ACM), and are
not applied to several verb clitics. Nevertheless, all the rules apply to all stem
suffixes. In 4.2, morphophonological rules not applied to certain clitics are further
discussed.
In the relevant sections throughout this thesis, when the rules of this section are
referred to, they are indicated by number between braces such as {M3}. Thus, the
common morphophonological rules of this section are easily distinguished from less
common processes applied to one or two morphemes. The latter are more like
exceptions in the language than rules. Each of the following rules is explained
afterwards with examples.",[56]
"Verb word morphology239Second person forms are always [+ATR], as well as the clitics for most other person
forms of incompletive imperfect verbs, but clitics of first and third person forms in
completive, subjunctive, and continuous past verbs are [-ATR]. Singular person
clitics have short vowels and plural person clitics have long vowels.

In 4.1.10, 7.7, and 8.3.8, clause-final subordinate clitics were discussed. In this
section, verb-final subordinate clitics are discussed, which differ in form and
function from clause-final subordinate clitics. Whereas clause-final subordinate
clitics mark the end of subordinate clauses, verb-final subordinate clitics mark verbs
as being in a subordinate clause and in which type of subordinate clause. There are
three verb-final subordinate clitics which appear with different subordinating
conjunctions introducing the clause. Third person subordinate clitics are listed in
table 50 and are shown in example clauses which follow. The first verb-final
subordinate clitic listed is introduced by either the conjunctions ‘when’ or ‘because’.

In (62), three subordinate clauses are sentence-initial, all marked with the clausefinal subordinate clitic=É (SBO). The verb-final clitics=i᷅ (SBO1) and=E᷇ (SBO2)
are attached to verbs in the same clause with the clause-final clitic. In (a-b), the
verb-final subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) attaches in clauses introduced with the
conjunctions ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ or ɛ́ kɔ̄rá ‘because’. In (c), the verb-final subordinate
clitic =E᷇ (SBO2) attaches in the conditional ‘if’ clause, not introduced by any242A grammar of Gaahmgconjunction. In conditional ‘if’ clauses, the subject pronoun ɛ̄ ‘he’ is required
between the noun subject and verb. The verb wə́r=ì ‘take=3sAM’ in the result
clauses of (a-b) has incompletive aspect and the verb wár-s=ɛ̀ɛ̀ ‘take-COMP=3sA’ in
the result clause of (c) has completive aspect. In addition, the object pronoun
attached to the verbs in the result clause of (a-b) is the marked [+ATR] object clitic
=ì, whereas in (c) is the unmarked [-ATR] object clitic =È.

and clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) can both be attached to verbs when
clause-final in definite relative clauses. In 15.3, it will be shown that the clause-final
subordinate clitic =É (SBO) attaches in interrogative clauses when interrogative
pronouns are pre-verbal. In 15.3, it will also be shown that when an interrogativeVerb word morphology243pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1)
is attached to the verb.
The same distinctions are made by verb-final clitics when the subordinate clause is
sentence-final as when the subordinate clause is sentence-initial.

‘in order to completely cut the people’Word structureBefore beginning morphology discussion on various word categories, it is important
to define how a word boundary is determined and how the terms ‘root’, ‘stem’ and
‘word’ are used in this thesis. The morphemes attached to roots and stems have
different functions, different morphophonological alternations, or in other ways are
treated as different kinds of morphemes in the language.
Word boundaries are determined by [+ATR] spreading. A word involves all bound
morphemes to which [+ATR] quality spreads; with the exception of a few
compounds (see footnote 8 in section 2.2.2.2), all vowels of a word have the same
[ATR] quality, all being either [+ATR] or all being [-ATR].
A root is the smallest lexical morpheme of a word and can be the entire word. A
stem is a root plus an optional suffix and can also be the entire word. A word
includes the stem and any optional clitics.
(27)Stem = root + (suffix)
Word = stem + (clitic) + (clitic)All suffixes of the language are a part of the stem and all clitics in the language are
outside of the stem, but inside the word. More than one clitic in the same word is
possible, but only one suffix is possible in a stem.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72]"

Relative clauses are introduced with the relativizer ná/nà ‘who, which, that’ which
agrees in number with the head noun it follows. Relative clauses have been attested
to modify noun subjects as in (48), objects as in (49), and copular complements as in
(50).

‘Those which we left behind . . ’ (Thng7)REL.PLRelative clauses differ from subordinate clauses in the conjunctions introducing the
clause, in the clause-final clitics, and in marking for definiteness. As will be
discussed in 15.2, the subordinate conjunctions ɛ́ gārá ‘when, while’, ɛ́ kɔ̄rá
‘because’, (ār) ‘if’, wàr ‘but’ introduce subordinate clauses instead of the relativizer
ná/nà. As shown in 7.7 and 8.3.8, the clause-final subordinate clitic is always =É
with High tone, whereas the relative clause clitic agrees in number with the head
noun =É/=È. Finally, subordinate clauses are not distinguished for definiteness,
but many relative clauses are.
Relative clauses can take the place of noun modifiers which are either marked or
unmarked for definiteness. Thus, relative clauses are also marked or unmarked for
definiteness. In (48-50), the relative clauses are definite, whereas in (51) the relative
clause is unmarked for definiteness. Most commonly the head noun is unmarked for
definiteness if the relative clause has a definite clitic. Singular definite clitics on
relative clauses have High tone and plural definite clitics have Low tone.
Table 59: Definite relative clause clitics
ShortSGPL=É=ÈIn noun phrases with dative, accompaniment, and subordinate clitics, there is no
marking for definiteness and the noun phrases are ambiguous for definiteness.
However, in relative clauses with such nouns, there is a definiteness distinction,
except with dative relative clauses which cannot attach a dative clitic to semantically
indefinite relative clauses. Some clitics such as the dative merge with the definite
relative clause clitic (=É=A᷇n becomes =ÉĒn), but other clitics such as the
accompaniment and subordinate follow the definite relative clause clitic (=É=nĒ
becomes =ÉÉ=nĒ, where =nĒ is the accompaniment clitic attaching to vowelfinal stems). This definite marking is shown in (52) where the same definite relative
clause clitics attach to clause-final nouns, adjectives and verbs—all consonant-final.
Dashes indicate there are no clitics on the clause-final word, whereas an x indicates
the word category cannot occur as definite.","[297, 298]"
53The prepositional pronoun d̪-ɛ́ɛn̄ ‘by-it’ expresses the agent of the agented passive clause.,[338]
"5.1Person and number markersPronouns in Gaahmg, regardless of case or number, use vowel features to represent
the person referred to. Depending on the type of pronoun, the vowel may be either
[+ATR] or unspecified for [ATR], and the three persons coincide with the language's
three vowel harmony pairs as shown in (1): [+back, -round] vowels represent first
person, [+round] vowels represent second person, and [-back] vowels represent third
person. Pronouns are marked for plural number agreement with the velar geminate
segment -gg-.

The suffix of (a) has no underlying tone, allowing the plural form to surface with
Low tone, the same as in the root. Whereas, the suffix of (b) has underlying Mid
tone and the suffix of (c) has underlying High tone. As will be shown in section
6.3.1, there are seven other noun plural suffixes with two or three tonal allomorphs,
most of which are not semantically or phonologically predictable with the root.

grammatical distinctions made only by tone in nouns and verbs. Grammatical tone
distinguishes bound morphemes with different grammar, or is a morpheme in itself,
either added to or replacing underlying stem tone.
Tone distinguishes bound morphemes, such as the copular and definite clitics of
(41). The copular singular clitic =Ā which takes the [ATR] value of the root has
underlying Mid tone, the copular plural clitic =À has underlying Low tone, and the
definite clitic =Á has underlying High tone.

10.7Where tone is a morpheme in itself, it can be added to segmental forms or can
replace the underlying tone of segmental forms. Tone is added to distinguish subject
persons of verb forms and to distinguish future and non-future subject pronouns.
Tone replacement is used for genitive case, plural person possession of body part
nouns, antipassives, causatives, and verbal nouns.
In verbs, tone marks subject person agreement by being added to the stem-final
syllable. As shown in (45), tone distinguishes third singular and third plural subject
verb forms from other person forms. The verb root of (45) has underlying High tone
and the completive suffix -sA has no underlying tone. In such verbs, high tone is
assigned to the stem-final syllable of third singular forms, Low tone is assigned to
the stem-final syllable of third plural forms, and Mid tone is assigned to the stemfinal syllable of first and second person forms.

follows the object pronoun and can be separate or attached. When attached, the
dative pronoun can be attached directly as in (27b) or n can be inserted between then
as in (c). In (d), the object pronoun follows an attached dative pronoun, but the third
singular object pronoun has a different form [=ÉÉn (which becomes =íín through
[+ATR] spreading) instead of =E (3sA) or =EEggÀ (3pA)]. An object can also
follow a dative pronoun by having a prepositional prefix d̪- as will be shown in (31e)
of 5.7 and is then a prepositional pronoun instead of an object pronoun.

In (28), the full paradigm of suffixed dative pronouns is shown attached to a
completive verb. The completive verb without the dative pronoun and object are
shown in (a), and the paradigm with dative suffix, assuming the same noun object, is
given in (b). In (a), the root vowel surfaces as ɔ, but in (b) becomes u with the
attached [+ATR] dative suffixes {M3}. In such examples, the vowel of the
completive suffix does not surface, as suffix vowels are elided by the initial vowel of
following suffix, as stated by the verb elision rule of {M1} in 3.1. Other dative
pronoun paradigms on verb forms are shown in 10.8.

to the subject. In (29a, b), the reflexive indicates the object which is the same90A grammar of Gaahmgreferent as the subject. However in (c), the reflexive meaning is extended and the
reflexive is used as a repeated object for emphasis. Instead of referring back to the
subject, it refers back to the object. In (29c), the plural noun ɟɔ̄gg ‘people/officials’
and the third plural reflexive ììŋg are objects of the verb máð ‘refuse’. The noun
ɟɔ̄gg represents the government and is emphasized with the reflexive, possibly
because of previous bad encounters with them. Reflexives are not found to be used
as repeated subjects.

‘He refused (to give money to) the officials by fighting.’ (Fand4)Reflexive pronouns are based on the inherently possessed word for ‘body’, which is
VVŋ, where V is the person marker vowel. As discussed in 5.2.4, the word for body
and a few other nouns cannot occur without possession using one of the person
marker vowels. With such words the norm is for [-ATR] vowels to indicate singular
persons, and for [+ATR] vowels as well as the plural suffix -gg to indicate plural
persons. However, all reflexive pronouns are [+ATR], and the suffix -gg as well as
Low tone indicate plural agreement.

3pRPrepositional pronounsPrepositional pronouns are objects of prepositions, or for another reason are prefixed
by the preposition marker d̪-. The prepositional prefix takes the place of the general
preposition ɛ́, í (GP) as in (31a-b) when introducing prepositional pronoun objects
The second pronoun ɛ̄ ‘he’ in (c) is the only occurrence found of a post-verbal
subject pronoun. Perhaps it is repeated for emphasis or there is an implied unstated
verb ‘to give’ of which ɛ̄ ‘he’ is the subject pronoun.
21Pronouns91(see 11.4). However, the prepositional prefix is used in addition to an adverb
functioning as a directional preposition such as d̪ūmùùn ‘towards’ in (c). It is also
used in addition to the animate accompaniment preposition ɛ ‘with’ and
accompaniment clitic =E᷇ on the pronoun as shown in (d). The marker is also used to
introduce verb objects when separated from the verb by a bound dative pronoun as
in (e) or by other verbal suffixes.

Ten texts of various genres are presented to show Gaahmg morphology and syntax
in the context of natural language. There are two folk narratives, two historical
narratives, two personal narratives, a conversation, an expository text, and two
persuasive texts. The texts were originally recorded on cassette, transcribed, and
glossed by speakers of the language, the recordings made from a variety of
individuals in the home area. Later, the texts were extensively checked by the
present author with speakers of the language and revised accordingly.","[319, 320]"

stem. First person object pronouns are analyzed as separate morphemes since they
remain [-ATR] regardless of the quality of the root to which they follow. Most
objects have more than one tonal allomorph for different subject person verbs to
which they attach. Tone of object pronouns is discussed further in 10.4.2.

3pAThere are two types of third person object pronouns, although the exact distinction
in function is not clear. For lack of better terms, they are called ‘marked (AM)’ and
‘unmarked (A)’ object pronouns in this thesis in accordance with their distinction in
vowel quality. The unmarked third person pronouns of (18) are unspecified for
[ATR], the same as first and second person object pronouns, and the marked third
person pronouns of (19) are [+ATR]. As with unmarked object pronouns, the
marked pronouns have more than one tonal allomorph for different subject person
verbs to which they attach. These are also further discussed in 10.4.2.

distinguish types of subordinate clauses introducing the referent to which the third

wár-s=ɛ̀ɛ̀ ‘take-COMP=3sA’ refers to the noun párɛ́=n ‘bag=DEF’ introduced in the
subordinate ‘if’ clause, whereas in (b) the marked [+ATR] object pronoun refers to a
noun introduced by the subordinate conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’. In 10.7, the verbs of
these subordinate clauses will be shown to take different subordinate clitics and are
grammatically distinct.","[86, 87]"
"7.7Subordinate clause-final cliticIn subordinate clauses such as those beginning with the subordinate conjunction ɛ́
gārá ‘when’, the clitic =É attaches to the clause-final word. The marker =É
attaches to the subordinate clause of (47a), beginning with the conjunction ɛ́ gāráNoun word149‘when’, and to the subordinate clause ɔ̀ gàɔ̀-sā gùrūs=íí ‘and when a person gave

The subordinate clause-final clitic =É (SBO) should not be confused with the
subordinate verb-final clitics (SBO1, SBO2) of 10.7. In (47a), the clitic =i᷅ (SBO1)
attaches to the verb kə᷄s-s=i᷅ ‘struck=COMP =SBO1’ in addition to the clause-final
clitic =É (SBO) and is a different morpheme.
Subordinate clauses are further discussed in section 15.2 on conjunctions. In 15.3 it
will be shown that the subordinate clause-final clitic attaches to interrogative clauses
in which the interrogative pronoun is pre-verbal. As shown in (23) of 4.1.11,
subordinate clauses can contain relative clauses. In 14.7 the difference between
subordinate clauses and relative clauses is discussed.
The subordinate clause clitic =É attaches to singular and plural nouns with stemfinal consonants and the clitic =nÉ attaches to stem-final vowels.

nouns or verbs since they are not used in some of the syntactic constructions of
either nouns or verbs, and there are differences in the morphology from either
category. Adjectives are generally not attested (NA) in use as subjects, objects, or
objects of prepositions. As will be discussed in 8.3, there are three differences in the
stem morphology of nouns and adjectives with final consonants. In verb paradigms,
the long forms of subject pronouns precede the adjectival verb instead of short
subject pronouns as in true verbs. The plural adjective suffix -gg and copular clitic
=A attach to adjectival verbs of plural persons, whereas these bound morphemes
are not attached to any true verb forms. These and other details specifying the
difference between adjectives and nouns and verbs are found in 4.3.
Adjective types are discussed in 8.1, stem morphology of qualitative adjectives in
8.2, and word morphology of qualitative adjectives in 8.3.","[149, 150, 151, 152]"

In such instances, the zero pronoun reference is normally recoverable from context.
The tone of the verb form distinguishes third singular and plural persons, as
described in section 9.8.","[83, 84]"
"3.4.2Mid tone lowering and Low tone raisingThere are two significant processes in stems and words—a Mid tone lowering
process and a Low tone raising process. In roots or stems with HM tone assigned toMorphophonology61the final syllable, the Mid tone assimilates to a Low tone of a bound morpheme.
The rule is symbolized in {M7} where the dash mark represents a morpheme
boundary of either an affix or clitic. The rule applies in both noun and verb stems.
{M7}Mid tone lowering
HM-L > HL-LThe plural noun wáār-g ‘insect’ has HM stem tone. The Mid tone becomes Low
when the plural copular clitic =À with Low tone is attached (wáàr-g=à).
The infinitive form of the verb bɛ᷇l ‘call’ has underlying HM tone. When the third
plural morpheme assigns Low tone to the completive suffix attached to this verb, the
root Mid tone becomes Low (bɛ̂l-d̪à).
