YL 19518.2 Negation: Using mos and neemee
English negative sentences usually have not or -n’t. Yurok negative sentences are usually
formed with the words in (117).
(117) Yurok negative words
(a) the ordinary negative preverb neemee, or (especially in Classical Yurok) its
variants mee, ’eemee, and keemee “will not”
(b) the emphatic negative particle mos (and a rare longer variant mosee’)
Note that neemee is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs,
while mos is a discourse particle that occurs, like to’, at the beginning of a sentence. In
texts and spontaneous language use by ﬂuent speakers, in the expression of negation
neemee is more common; mos occurs in an important but restricted set of situations.",[110]
"80/Using other preverbs8.2.1 Ordinary and emphatic negation
The emphatic negative particle mos is used in four main situations.
First, mos is the usual negative word used to express meanings such as “nobody”,
“nothing”, “not . . . anybody”, and “not anything”. As shown in (118), examples mostly
have mos kol’.
(118)Examples of mos kol’
(a) Mos kol’ soosek’.
“I’m not thinking about anything.”
(b) Mos kol’ kee nee nosep’.
“Nobody could marry there.”
(c) q: Neemee hes newoom’ kuech kue ’ne-ka’ar?
a: Paa, tos, mos k’ee we’yk’oh ’u-wook kol’ ’o newook’.
“Haven’t you seen my pet, grandmother?”
“No, child, I have not seen anything here this morning.”
(d) Mos kwelekw wee’eeet kol’ mehl son’.
“That does not matter to me.”","[110, 111]"
"BF 1951 (YL)
FS 1951 (YL)Using other preverbs/81Finally, in (122), examples are given of a fourth context for mos. For instance, the
emphasis in (122a) is clear from the emphatic pronoun kelee’: “this is absolutely not
your ﬁshing place!” The example in (122b) implies the meaning “any”. In general, when
the intended negative expresses or implies meanings such as “not at all” or “not any”,
then the emphatic negative particle mos is used.
(122) Emphatic mos
(a) Mos kelee’ k’-ekwol.
“It is not your ﬁshing place.”
(b) Mos kee nahcheechek’ .
“I won’t give you any.”","[111, 112]"
"82/Using other preverbs8.2.2 Negation and time reference
8.2.2.1Negation and past timeA special past-time preverb wo is used in negative contexts. This is the most common
way of expressing past time negation. The examples in (126) illustrate wo in sentences
negated with neemee.
(126)Examples of neemee wo
(a) Kwesee’ neemee nuemee wo chpaa nohl helomey’.
“Coyote did not dance for a very long time.”
(b) Neemee wo hlee’.
“It was not accepted.”
(c) Neemee wo weykee’.
“It was not ﬁnished.”
(d) Neemee heenoy wo hoole’moh.
“We did not follow you.”
(e) Neemee wo nahchelek’ kee ’ne-hlkyorkwek’.
“I wasn’t allowed to watch.”
(f) Neemee wo skeweenepek’.
“I didn’t eat enough.”","[112, 113]"
"MM 1927 (ES)
JJ 2007 (LC)
GT 2003 (YLCB)In (162c), subjunctive k’-oleemek’ would have been possible instead of k’e-holeemek’.
9.3.1.2Questions expecting a negative answerSome questions presuppose that a negative answer is likely. An English example is Don’t
you see the hawk?, to which a likely answer is No, I don’t see it. In Yurok, much as in
English, such questions are formed with negatives. Examples are in (163).
(163)Questions expecting a negative answer
(a) Neemee hes newoom’ kuech kue ’ne-ka’ar?
“Haven’t you seen my pet, grandmother?”
(b) Kuech, nee mok’w hes ’oyhl kee nepek’?
“Grandmother, isn’t there anything lying here for me to eat?”
(c) Nee mok’w hes k’-ohsepek’?
“Aren’t you ashamed?”",[125]
"FS 1951 (YL)
BF 1951 (YL)FS 1951 (YL)
FS 1951 (YL)Second, mos is the usual negative word used with the particle cheetaa “at all”. Examples of mos cheetaa “not at all” are shown in (119).
(119)Examples of mos cheetaa “not at all’
(a) Mos cheetaa wo pahchew.
“It was not moving at all.”
(b) Mos cheetaa kue ’wo-’o’hl.
“His house was no more.”
(c) Kwesee mos cheetaa wo neee’nowee’.
“And no notice at all was taken of him.”",[111]
"GT 2003 (YCLB)
JJ 2006 (AG)As illustrated in (256), t’p’ohlkwek’ is very often used with an overt negative in a meaning
like “hasn’t got any sense”. (In this construction with a negative, it can also describe
someone who has fainted.)
(256)(a)Neemee t’p’ohlkwem’.
“You’ve got no sense.”
(b) Neemee skuy’ soo t’p’ohlkwee’mow’.
“You don’t have good sense.”
(c) Keech mee’ t’p’ohl.
“You aren’t thinking clearly.”",[196]
"YL 1951
YL 1951¹ This is a contraction of ’ok’w with negative neemee: that is, neemee ’ok’w → neemo’ok’w → neemok’w.",[134]
"MM 1927 (ES)
GT 2003 (YLCB)
GT 2003 (YLCB)92/Sentence patternsThe literal meaning of this construction is “well (chyue), we’ll (kee) . . .”
Finally, as in (159), prohibitions or negative commands or prohibitions are formed
using kowecho’ with a second-person verb: “Don’t do it!”
(159)9.3Negative commands
(a) Kowecho’ moskem’ ’ne-muech ro’.
“Don’t borrow my car.”","[122, 123]"
"9.3.1 Yes–no questions
Yes–no questions are formed using the question particle hes, positioned either at the
end of the sentence (this is less common) or (more often) after the ﬁrst word or phrase
of the sentence. The examples below are divided into two groups: neutral questions,
whose answer might be “yes” or “no” (§9.3.1.1), and questions whose expected answer
is “no” (§9.3.1.2).
9.3.1.1Neutral yes–no questionsThe most common position for hes is immediately after the ﬁrst word of the sentence,
as in (160).
(160)Questions with hes after the ﬁrst word
(a) Kel’ hes keech cherhkwerm’?
“Are you jumping center?”",[123]
"2.6ParticlesThe term particle refers to a set of ﬁve different word classes which share two features:
all of them have relatively few words, ranging from only two articles to a few dozen
preverbs; and in all cases they cannot be used on their own to form utterances. Particles
occur only with other words. For example, since you can answer a question with just
an adverb, an adverb is not a particle: if someone asks where you’re going, you can just
answer lekwsee “outside”. A noun is not a particle because if someone asks what you want
to eat, you can say nepuy “salmon” by itself. But you cannot say words like keetee, ’ochkaa,
k’ee, or kwelekw on their own without being part of a larger phrase or sentence. The ﬁve
Yurok word classes that can be regarded as particles are detailed in §§2.6.1–2.6.5.",[51]
"Using other preverbs/878.4.1 Using keetkwo and noo
The preverb keetkwo can be translated “still”, or in combination with a negative “(not)
yet”; examples are in (144).
(144) Examples of keetkwo
(a) Keetkwo nee cheeweyek’.
“I’m still hungry.”
(b) Keetkwo mee ’ue hewechek’.
“I am not well yet.”","[117, 118]"
"2.6.3 Discourse particles
The term discourse particle refers to the class of words that includes hes, kem “also, even”,
kwelekw, to’, and tue’. Most Yurok discourse particles tend to occur near the beginnings
of sentences, and while a few have uses that are easy to describe (for example see §9.3.1
on the question particle hes), many have very elusive meanings and will not be discussed
here.",[51]
"LBy 1902 (ALK)QuestionsQuestions are of the following two types:
• In a yes–no question, there are only a couple of natural answers. For example, thelikely answers to the English question Will you help me? are either Yes or No (or some
expansion or equivalent).
• In a content question, the range of likely answers is broader. For example, given theEnglish question Who will help me?, there are numerous possible answers depending
on the circumstances: Alice, Bert, Charlie, Donna, etc.
In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions are formed in different
ways. In English, for example, content questions use a word such as where?, what?,
why?, etc., while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order: Can you hear
me? Yurok too has two different methods for forming the two types of questions.",[123]
"JVP 2001 (JB)
YL 1951The preverb noo expresses continued activity and can be translated as “keep (doing
something)”. In combination with a negative, it can be translated as “stop (doing something)”; examples are in (145).
(145) Examples of noo
(a) Tue noo laay’.
“He kept going along.”
(b) Kowecho’ noo chkeyem’.
“Stop sleeping.” (lit. “Don’t keep sleeping.”)DW 1907 (ALK)
OB 1927 (ALK)8.4.2 Using neenee
The preverb neenee has two main uses. First, it is used for actions that move around, or
events that simultaneously take place, in a variety of places; “about” or “around” is often a
good translation. Examples with verbs that are consistent with motion appear in (146).
(146) Examples of neenee “(going) around”
(a) Wee’ neenee kepoyuerek’.
“I swim about at random.”
(b) Kolo wee’ neenee hak’ws.
“She was kind of laughing around there.”",[118]
"FS 1951 (YL)
FS 1951 (RHR)By contrast, the ordinary negative preverb neemee is used in other situations. It is
the default negative marker, and illustrated in (123).
(123) Examples of neemee
(a) Neemee skuy’ soneenepek’.
“I don’t feel well.”
FS 1980 (PP)
(b) Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet.
“It’s not very windy here.”
FS 1980 (PP)
(c) Kue pa’aahl ’we-tmenomen neemee nepue’.
“The half of the salmon facing the water was not eaten.”
FS 1951 (YL)
(d) Muehlcho’ neemee soo komchuemehl.
“Perhaps they do not know.”
FS 1951 (YL)
(e) Neemee hegohkuemehl stowstek’ ’ue-’weskwen neemee mehl hego’omah.
“They did not pick ﬁr branches and did not make ﬁre with them.”
FS 1951 (YL)The difference between mos and neemee comes out sometimes in the difference between mos skuy’ and neemee skuy’. Mos skuy’ means “not at all well” — implying “quite
badly”; examples are in (124).
(124) Examples of mos skuy’
(a) Mos skuy’ kee k’e-teloyewek’.
“It’s not (at all) good for you to lie.”
(b) Mos nuemee skuy’ soo chwegeen kue wenchokws.
“I really don’t like to talk to that woman.”
(c) Mos skuy’ soo chkeyek’ nahschueh.
“I didn’t sleep well last night.”",[112]
"Special symbols
† A dagger or obelisk marks phrases or sentences that are unacceptable to ﬂuent speakers of a language; you cannot say them. For example, in English †Man the is old is
impossible. Similarly, in Yurok, because a preverb like ’ochkaa must precede the
verb, you cannot say †Kepoyuerek’ ’ochkaa.
* An asterisk marks Yurok expressions that are almost certainly possible, but that do
not happen to be documented in recordings of speakers.",[27]
"6.4.1 Forming subjunctives
The subjunctive preﬁxes and endings are shown in Table 6.7 on page 55. The forms in
this table have preﬁxes; their endings make singular forms look like 1 sg verbs, but preﬁxes disambiguate key forms. Examples of subjunctive clauses (underlined) with skewok
are given in (55) for statements and in (56) for questions.
¹ Subjunctive verbs were called pronominal-prefix verbs in R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958; for the
full reference see the Bibliography on page 299). A subjunctive non-inﬂected verb is in fact indistinguishable
from a possessed noun; the word ’ue-pa’ah may be interpreted as “for it to be wet” (non-inﬂected verb) or
“its water” (noun). An alternative linguistic term for subjunctives might be subordinative, because they are
associated with subordinate clauses.",[85]
"7.1 Background
There are several important differences between the Yurok and English systems of time
reference. One concerns basic tense categories. In English, the basic categories are
past vs. present vs. future: “I saw” vs. “I see” vs. “I will see”. Many languages have an
English-style three-way set, but many other languages — including Yurok — have different systems. It is possible to distinguish past-time and future-time preverbs in Yurok,
but the basic system is more nuanced.
A second important difference has to do with present vs. past time. In English,
whenever you use a verb you must choose between a present-time form (I see) or a
past-time form (I saw), among other verb forms. A distinction between present and
past is obligatory in English grammar. But in Yurok, depending on context, verbs may
express either present or past time; for example, newook’ can mean either “I see” or “I
(recently) saw”. The context will usually make the intended meaning clear.
A third important difference concerns aspect. Linguists use this term to describe
such concepts as starting and completing an action, as well as the viewpoint that a
speaker chooses on an action being described (for example, depicting it as ongoing or
unitary). You do not need to know this terminology, but the concepts sometimes play a
key role in Yurok preverb choice.
Table 7.1 on page 65 lists the eight Yurok categories of time reference described
in this chapter, with the frequency of each preverb. By far the most frequent is keech;
second is kee. Many preverbs of time are omitted from Table 7.1 and are not discussed
here. They would be included in a complete study of Yurok grammar, though some are
poorly documented, making it hard to understand all their nuances.",[94]
"Chapter 10Vocabulary patterns
10.1Expressing “be”, “have”, and related meaningsIn Yurok, meanings like “be” and “have” are expressed quite differently from the way they
are expressed in English. There is no Yurok verb or other word that has the same range
of uses as English be or have. Here a few important constructions that partly correspond
to thse English verbs are described: descriptive sentences (§10.1.1), nominal sentences
(§10.1.2), posture constructions (§10.1.3), and possession sentences (§10.1.4).","[129, 130]"

In any language, words can be grouped into various classes, which are deﬁned partly by
their meaning and partly by how they are used in sentences. It is useful to identify the
word classes of a language because then you can make general statements about them,
such as “Yurok nouns do not usually change according to whether they are singular or
plural” and “Yurok preverbs are positioned before the verb”.
Though there are many similarities across languages, word classes do differ from
language to language. For example, English has a class of adjectives; Yurok does not.
In Yurok, the meanings that are expressed by English adjectives are instead expressed
by the class of verbs. Likewise, English has no class of preverbs despite the importance
of this word class in Yurok grammar. English also lacks non-inflected verbs.
Every Yurok word belongs to one of the ten word classes below.","[46, 47, 48]"
"5.1 Overview
Many details of verb formation are in chapters 5–6. First, an overview of some of the
most important categories of inﬂected verbs may be useful. The speciﬁc categories identiﬁed pertain to mood, a linguistic term which refers broadly to the type of sentence or
clause that a verb appears in. Yurok inﬂected verbs have four different moods, as follows:
• indicative (discussed in this chapter): used in most simple statements and questions
• imperative (discussed in this chapter): used in direct commands
• subjunctive (§6.4): typically used when one verb is dependent on another verb
• attributive (§6.5): used in phrases that modify or stand in for nouns38/Basic verb formationThe four moods have somewhat different endings, and are used in different ways.
Given in (37) are forms of hegook’ “I walk, I go”: an indicative, an imperative, a subjunctive, and an attributive.
(37)5.2(a) indicative: Nek keetee hegook’ so Rek’woy.
“I am going to go to Requa.”
(b) imperative: Hego’och so kue muenchey nahko’!
“Go to the white board!”
(c) subjunctive: Nek weet soneenepek’ kee ’n-egook’.
“I think I will go.”
(d) attributive: Soo smeykoluemee’ kue keech hegookween.
“They miss the one who has gone.”","[68, 69]"
"2.6.5 Preverbs
A preverb is a kind of Yurok word that is short (one or two syllables) and ordinarily
occurs before the verb, expressing meanings having to do with time, place, and direction (among various other notions). The meanings expressed by preverbs are broardly
similar to those expressed by adverbs, but adverbs can have much more speciﬁc meanings (like “tomorrow” or “over there”) and adverbs can occupy various positions in the
sentence. Typical Yurok preverbs include ho (referring to past time), keech (referring to
past and present time), and nue (referring to motion that takes place together with the
verbal action). Some of the most common Yurok preverbs are listed here:
• Circumstance, manner, and relation: ’eekee, keekee, mehl, neekee, neenee noo, see, soo
• Direction and location: ’ee, nee, ’o, so
• Directed motion: nue
• Negation: ’eemee, mee, neemee
• Time: kee, keech, keet, keetee, keetue, kue, ma, ’ochkaa, woSee chapter 7 for information about preverbs of time, and chapter 8 for information
about preverbs of negation (§8.2), directed motion (§8.3), and other meanings (§8.4).",[52]
"YL 1951
YL 19518.2.2.3 Negation and keech
With the resultative preverb keech, the negation may appear before or after keech; the
difference is important. As seen in (131), negation + keech means “not yet”.
(131) Negation + keech “not yet”
(a) Mos keech ’ee roo kee ’ue-kemeyeem’.
“It is not time to go home yet.”
(b) Mos keech hopkekom’.
“He has not started yet.”
(c) Neemee keech lekon’.
“It has not fallen yet.”",[114]
"YL 1951
FS 1951 (YL)
DW 1907 (ALK)
YL 1951The idiom in (132d) means “he is dead”, clearly highlighting “no longer” interpretation.
8.2.2.4 Negation and iterative verbs
There is one situation in which ho is regularly used in referring to past time: if a verb
is iterative, with the inserted element -eg- that means “always” or “regularly”, then ho is
used to express the meaning “used to”. This is illustrated in (133).
(133)(a)Neemee ho negepue’ nepuy.
“Salmon used to be eaten.”",[114]
"FS 1951 (YL)
FS 1951 (YL)
YL 1951Negation and future timeTo express future negation, two patterns are common; the modal future preverb kee is
used with mos or neemee.¹ Typically, as in (128), neemee kee means “will not (won’t)”.
(128)Examples of neemee kee “will not”
(a) Neemee kee kooych.
“I will not buy it.”
(b) Neemee kee skuy’ soo hoole’mow’.
“You will not get on well.”",[113]
"10.2.4Verbs in weno’om- “how far”Verbs that begin with the relative root weno’om- answer (or ask) the question “how far?”
They typically refer to a location (in space or time), and are used only in sentences where
an additional word or phrase indicates the location. In (195a), for example, the location
is indicated by wee’ “that (place)”, and in (195b) it is expressed by poyew noohl “far ahead”.
(195)(a)Kel’ kem wee’ ho weno’omuerem’.
“You too swam there.”
(b) Poyew noohl weno’omor’ kue mewah.
“The boy is running far ahead.”",[136]

"Acknowledgements
We would not know what we know about Yurok without the patient work of ﬂuent
speakers who never stopped teaching their language. I had the good fortune to learn
from ’aawokw Aileen Figueroa, Jimmie James, Glenn Moore, Sr., Archie Thompson, and
Georgiana Trull. I have also spent many hours listening to, and reading transcripts of,
the voices of other Yurok speakers, including the elders of a century and longer ago;
those of the mid-twentieth century, such as Lowana Brantner, Frank Douglas, Florence
Shaughnessy, Alice Spott, and Robert Spott; and many others. All of them generously
shared their knowledge so their language can endure with its people.
Also essential have been linguists of earlier generations who worked with ﬂuent
speakers to document Yurok, carefully studied aspects of its grammar, and published
valuable analyses of its patterns. The most important of these linguists is R. H. Robins,
whose book The Yurok language (1958) contains key observations on every page; this
book makes constant use of what he learned from Florence Shaughnessy and other
Yurok elders. Also invaluable is the work of Howard Berman, A. L. Kroeber, Paul Proulx,
Edward Sapir, and T. T. Waterman. These scholars created a lasting analytic framework
for the study of Yurok grammar.
This book is intended for members of the Yurok community — language learners and
teachers — and is a direct result of their support and inspiration. Participants in the Yurok
Language Institute and grammar workshops have made helpful comments and suggestions on grammar, handouts, and drafts of part of this book; they include Tammy Cairns,
Leo Canez, Georgiana Gensaw, Robert R. Kinney, Kate Lowry, Skip Lowry, Chelsea
Reed, Margo Robbins, Bessie Shorty, Britty Vigil, Lawrence Williams, and others. The
Yurok Tribe language program staff over the years — Victoria Carlson, James Gensaw,
Barbara McQuillen, Kathleen Vigil, and their colleagues and interns — are good friends
and engaging teachers. Long-time Yurok language teacher Kay Inong has played an important role in creating a language curriculum that informs the choice of topics covered
in this book. The Yurok Tribe language program poy ’we-son, Carole Lewis, deserves special mention for her hard work and long-term vision in creating a program that inspires
communities throughout California. Thanks also to activist, artist, and Yurok language
teacher Annelia Hillman for kindly contributing original artwork to this book.
Without two friends who changed my career, I would never have worked with the
Yurok language. Leanne Hinton introduced me to California language documentation
and revitalization, and has offered unstinting support. Juliette Blevins introduced me to
Yurok itself, persuaded me that a philologist could play a role in the community, and
talked with me for years about the grammar of the language. I am forever grateful toxxii/Acknowledgementsboth of them.
My colleagues Lisa Conathan, James Martin, Line Mikkelsen, Alysoun Quinby, Ruth
Rouvier, Justin Spence, and Tess Wood have greatly improved my understanding of
Yurok grammar with ideas and work that have made a difference throughout this book.

Berkeley, CaliforniaPreface
This book is meant to be used by Yurok language teachers and advanced learners, in
support of language restoration in the Yurok community. That goal has determined the
contents and style of what follows. Linguists and other scholars may ﬁnd this useful
as well, but should be aware that it is not an academic reference grammar. All readers
should keep in mind that languages are best learned by speaking and listening; this is a
supplement to the spoken language.
This is a combination, expansion, and revision of two earlier publications, Yurok verb
guide: 75 common verbs (2009, 78 pages) and Basic Yurok grammar (2010, 69 pages).
Those earlier books are completely superseded by this one; substantial content has been
added and signiﬁcant errors have been corrected.
Part I (chapters 1–10) provides information about the sounds of Yurok and about
basic grammatical and vocabulary patterns. Many were identiﬁed by the Yurok Tribe
for teacher certiﬁcation purposes. Part II (chapters 11–25) introduces the meanings and
forms of the most common Yurok verbs. Over 200 different verbs are covered, in 117
numbered sections. Because Yurok verbs tend to pack more information into them than
English verbs, Yurok verbs usually have many different forms, indicating participants
in the action and sometimes also relations to other verbs in the sentence. Some Yurok
verbs have dozens of different forms. This makes a guide useful.
Other grammatical topics are discussed only brieﬂy (such as some of the preverbs),
or are omitted entirely (such as reﬂexive and reciprocal verbs, locative forms of nouns,
and many sentence patterns). Advanced learners and teachers may consult R. H. Robins’s
1958 book The Yurok language: Grammar, texts, lexicon, written in a technical style for
linguists, and other linguistic publications. See the Bibliography on pages 299–300 for

"114/Verb overviewRelated verbs
Closely related verbs are sometimes shown. This means other verbs derived from the
same root, but differing in form, meaning, or usage. This will often include non-inﬂected
verbs. Examples of groups of closely related verbs include the verbs in (203) and the
verbs in (204). Within these groups, non-inﬂected megetohl in (203) and myah in (204)
are the most common individual forms. You will ﬁnd them listed under megetohlkwook’
(page 274) and myaahlkepek’ (page 229).
(203)Verbs related to megetohlkwook’ “I take care of it”
(a) megetohl “take care of’
(b) megetohlkwepek’ “I take care of myself’(204)Verbs related to myaahlkook’ “I jump”
(a) myah “jump”
(b) myaahlkepek’ “I jump”
(c) myaahlkahpeemek’ “I jump on him”Meaning and usage
Information about how a verb is used, and what it means, is always given, with example
sentences.
Verbs with similar meanings
It can be helpful to know how a verb differs from other verbs with similar meanings.
For example, hohkuemek’, serrhlerperk’, and sonowok’ can all sometimes be translated as
“do”. An attempt is made to explain the differences in such cases.
Inﬂected forms
Every inﬂected verb in Yurok has numerous possible forms. Many of these are given for
reference in the chapters that follow. Essential grammatical terminology is explained
in chapter 5, beginning on page 37; see also the Glossary of terminology and symbols,
beginning on page xix.
For all verbs, ordinary (indicative) forms are given, and in most cases subjunctive,
attributive, and imperative forms. For many verbs, collective plurals are included. For
transitive verbs, passive and bipersonal forms are often given.
Readers should note that not every form cited here has been documented. In fact,
most of the forms cited have not been documented, but are presented according to the
regular grammatical patterns of the Yurok language. On page 121, for example, the 1 pl
subjunctive of hohkuemek’ “I make” is given as ’n-ohkuemoh even though this precise
form has not been recorded. But other subjunctive forms are documented, and the formation of 1 pl subjunctives is quite regular as far as is known.
The use of predictable but undocumented forms is not desirable; ideally, every word
in a book like this would be checked with a ﬂuent ﬁrst-language speaker. But this is unfortunately no longer possible. Academic researchers and others who prefer to make use
of only those forms that were actually documented from a ﬂuent ﬁrst-language speaker
should consult the corpus of Yurok data at linguistics.berkeley.edu/~yurok.","[144, 145]"
"Chapter 9Sentence patterns
9.1 Basic word order
Yurok word order is ﬂexible. It is often possible to arrange the words in the same sentence in two or more different ways, all of them quite acceptable. The order that speakers
choose may depend more on emphasis and the nature of their conversation or story than
on purely syntactic rules. But several clear patterns can be noted here.","[118, 119, 120]"
"Part IBasic grammarChapter 1The sounds of Yurok
1.1 Writing and pronunciation
The principle of the basic sound, which linguists call the phoneme, underlies the writing
of a language and its sound patterns. In every language, sounds can be arranged into a
set of phonemes or basic sounds. Sometimes a phoneme is pronounced in only one
way in a language; or a single phoneme may have two or more different pronunciations
depending on its position in the word, or on nearby sounds.¹ In what follows, the writing
system to be described is phonemic in the sense that each basic Yurok sound has a
unique spelling (which may consist of more than one letter, such as ch, er, or eee).","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
"GT 2003 (YLCB)
YL 1951
YL 1951By contrast, as in (132), keech + negation means “now (something is) not” or “no longer”.
(132) Keech + negation “no longer”
(a) Keech neemee skuyen’.
“Now it is no good.”
(b) Keech mee chweenkep’.
“He stopped talking.”
(c) Keech mehl mok’w k’e-tewon.
“You no longer have ﬂesh.”
(d) Keech mee’ pyuech son’.
“He is not well now.”",[114]
"Sentence patterns/959.3.2 Content questions
Unlike yes–no questions, content questions seek a more open-ended answer to questions like “who?”, “when?”, “where?”, etc. They can be classiﬁed according to the type of
information they seek, and also according to their form. In Yurok, content questions are
formed using one of the question words tee’now, tee’neeshoo, and kues. Among these,
kues is the most ﬂexible.
9.3.2.1 Who? What?
Questions that ask “who?”, as in (164), use the question word tee’now.
(164) Questions with tee’now
(a)Tee’now puen’?
“Who farted?”(b) Tee’now swechohpen’ kue ’ahtemar?
“Who opened the letter?”
(c) Tee’now helomey’?
“Who’s dancing?”
(d) Tee’now ho helomey’?
“Who was dancing?”
(e)Tee’now keech kweryerw’?
“Who whistled?”","[125, 126]"
"10.1.2Nominal sentencesIn English, forms of the verb be are used in sentences like This is a salmon, I am a doctor,
and My pets are cats. In such sentences, somebody or something is said to be a person or
thing; a be + noun construction is used. In Yurok, by contrast, the noun itself is used with
no verb that means “is” or “be” — a construction sometimes called a nominal sentence;
the noun or noun phrase itself is sometimes called a predicate nominal. Examples are100/Vocabulary patternsin (178–179). It is common for nominal sentences to include the pronoun wee’, as in
(178); the predicate nominal is underlined.
(178)Examples of “X (is) Y” with wee’
(a) Segep wee’ kue nepuy.
“That salmon (was) Coyote.”
(b) Kel’ kee nepuy wee’.
“You’ll (be) a salmon.”
(c) Lochom’ kwel wenchokws wee’.
“A toad (is) a woman.”
(d) Nek kwelekw wee’ neemuech ’ne-tektoh.
“(It is) my own log.”","[130, 131]"
"GT 2007 (LC)
MR ∼1970 (MRo)
FS 1951 (RHR)¹ Strictly speaking, the type of subordination at issue is complementation. Attributive verbs (§6.5) are used
in another subordinate clause type, the relative clause.
² Learners will note that in Classical Yurok not all speakers used the words wokhlew and koweeshcho’ in the
same way they are used today.",[86]
"10.2Relative rootsYurok has many verbs beginning with no’om-, son-, tom-, or weno’om-, which are called
relative roots.¹ Such verbs have in common that a sentence containing one of them is
incomplete unless a word or phrase is added to express a particular relation implied by
the root. Details differ depending on the initial element, but this general proﬁle is the
same across all four roots.",[135]
"10.1.1Descriptive sentencesIn English, expressions like I am tall, the boat is long, and my children are good contain
forms of the verb be and an adjective. But because Yurok has no adjectives, it ordinarily
uses verbs to express meanings like the ones expressed by be + an adjective in English.
Many Yurok verbs describe properties; sentences with such verbs can be called descriptive sentences. Examples are in (177).
(177)(a)Noorew’ kue chegemem.
“The hummingbird is pretty.”
(b) Yo’ sega’agey’.
“She is rich.”
(c) Keech teytesek’, keech hlmeyowok’.
“I am angry, I am mean.”",[130]
"YL 1951
FS 1951 (YL)Finally, especially in Classical Yurok, cho’ sometimes expresses a temporal relation between clauses. This is not common, but in this construction the cho’ clause apparently
expresses near-simultaneity. In the examples in (116), the clause with cho’ is underlined.
(116) Examples of cho’ expressing temporal relation
(a) Keet hego’omah cho’ nuue’mehl yo’hlkoh.
“We were starting to make ﬁres (when) they arrived.”
(b) Kue cho plegohpeen kee yegook’.
“When the water is high I will go.”
(c) Kue yo’ keetee cho sootoleen nek kee megelook’.
“When he is going to leave, I will go with him.”",[110]

This means (for a person, animal, or bird) to be or remain standing, or be standing in
a place, and thus it can also mean “be located” more generally. Examples are in (373);
underlined words or phrases express the location.
(373)(a)Weesh nee ’oolo’ kue ’ne-psech.
“My father stood there.”

"10.1.4Possession sentencesYurok lacks a verb with the precise meaning of English have. (Verbs like ’ekonemek’ “hold”
and megetohlkwook’ “take care of” have more speciﬁc meanings.) Instead, to express the
meaning of English sentences like I have a brother or You have a pretty dress, Yurok
uses a form of the verb ’ook’ “I am”. This may seem counterintuitive to English-speaking
students, and diﬃcult to master, but it is one of the most common Yurok constructions.
Schematically, where X stands for some noun, the construction is this: ’ok’w ’ne-X “I
have an X”. But the verb form ’ok’w does not actually mean “have”; it is a third-person
singular form of ’ook’ “I am”, and it means literally “there is”. What the schematic sentence
’ok’w ’ne-X means literally is “there is my X” or “my X exists”. This is how Yurok (like
many languages) expresses the meaning “have”. Some examples are given in (186).
(186)(a) ’Ok’w ’ner-erkerh.
“I have a ﬁshing rock.”
(lit. “My ﬁshing rock exists.”)FS 1980 (PP)(b) Kel’ ’ok’w skuyenee k’e-’yoch.
“You have a good boat.”
(lit. “Your good boat exists.”)YL 1951(c) Pegoy ’ok’w ’ue-poy.
“Yellowhammer has a tattoo.”
(lit. “Yellowhammer’s tattoo exists.”)YL 1951(d) Kwesee ’ok’w ’ue-peechowos.
“And he had a grandfather.”
(lit. “And his grandfather existed.”)
(e)’Ok’w hes k’-ahpew?
“Do you have a wife?”
(lit. “Does your wife exist?”)FS 1951 (YL)MM 1927 (ES)Note the position occupied by modiﬁers of the noun: attributive modiﬁers like skuyenee
“good” in (186b) appear after ’ok’w; but nouns and pronouns that emphasize or identify the possessor, including kel’ “you” in (186b) and pegoy “yellowhammer” in (186c),
typically appear before ’ok’w.
To negate sentences like those in (186), a similar construction is used with neemok’wVocabulary patterns/103Figure 10.2: Lila M. O’Neale, an anthropologist and textile researcher, and Nellie Cooper, a Yurok basket
weaver, on the Klamath River in 1929. O’Neale collaborated with many Yurok weavers to document their art,
its social meanings, and related practices and vocabulary.or neemo’ok’w, literally “it is not” or “there does not exist”.¹ Examples are in (187).
(187)(a)Neemok’w ’ue-kerter’.
“It has no lid.”
(lit. “Its lid does not exist.”)
(b) Neemok’w ’ne-cheeek.

“He no longer had any ﬂesh.”
(lit. “His ﬂesh no longer exists.”)FS 1980 (PP)MR ∼1970 (MRo)DW 1907 (ALK)Finally, a similar construction is used to express the meanings “have a lot of” and
“have little of”. The verbs used are teno’ “there’s a lot of it” and chkeno’ “there’s little of it”;
examples are in (188).
(188)(a)Yo’ teno’ ’we-chegel’.
“She has a lot of seaweed.”

"2.4 Pronouns
A pronoun is a kind of word that stands in place of a noun. It may be the subject or object
of a verb, for example, but its reference may differ from sentence to sentence, depending
on context. English pronouns include words like me, that, and what. Yurok pronouns are
of three types:
• personal pronouns refer to “I”, “you”, “me”, etc.: nek, kel’, nekah, kelew, etc.
• demonstrative pronouns refer to a third person, that is, “s/he”, “that one”, “them”, etc.:yo’, wee’eeet, etc.
• question (or interrogative) pronouns include words like kues “how?”, tee’now “who?”,tee’neeshoo “what?”, and other words in forming content questions (§9.3.2).",[50]
"FS 1980 (PP)
FS 1951 (YL)
RS 1933 (PJS)1.1.4 Twentieth century pronunciation changes
All languages change all the time. During the last hundred years, Yurok has changed in
several ways. If you listen to old recordings or read old transcriptions (or publications),
you may encounter pronunciations that are less common today. The following are some
of the most notable Modern Yurok pronunciation changes:
• The variant of the g phoneme that sounds like English g has become more common(§1.1.3.1).
• The variant of the w phoneme that sounds like English w has become more common(§1.1.3.2).
• The tense variant of the e phoneme more often has the quality of the vowel of Englishbait (§1.1.3.3).
• Some unstressed vowels are likelier to have the neutral quality of the ﬁrst vowel inEnglish about.
These changes reﬂect a process called accommodation, in this case between Yurok
and English; this is a process that happens when people who are bilingual unconsciously
adapt their speech to the speech of other people they talk with. Accommodation is a sign
of linguistic adaptability and strength, a process that happens in all healthy languages all
the time; speakers of Modern Yurok are as ﬂuent as any earlier generations of speakers.",[42]
"JJ 2004 (JB)The example in (96a) was given as a good, positive answer to the question Komchuepa’
hes? “Do you know me?” The example in (96b) would be appropriate if the speaker at
ﬁrst could not remember the other person, and then suddenly recalled: “Oh, now I know
you!” That is, keech signals a change of situation from not knowing to knowing.
The difference between keech and ’ochkaa is illustrated in (97–100).
(97)(a)Keech swoo’mel’.
“He stinks (from contact with something).”(b) ’Ochkaa swoo’mel’.
“He stinks (naturally).”
(98)(99)(a)YL 1951Keech no’oyek’.
“I have shoes on.”",[104]
"Finally, ﬁrst-person and second-person attributive phrases are illustrated in (65).
These occur in the same patterns as the third-person attributives, but are less often used.

“the man you went to see” (newook’ “I see it”)YL 19516.6 Iterative verbs
Every Yurok verb has iterative forms. Usually these are used to express the meaning
that an activity or situation involves multiple actions or events.¹ For example, a single
person may do something on multiple occasions, or habitually; or multiple people may
do something on the same occasion.
¹ In his book The Yurok language (1958), R. H. Robins used the term “intensive” to describe what are here called
iterative verbs. These verbs were studied in detail by Andrew Garrett, “Reduplication and inﬁxation in Yurok”
(2001), and Esther Wood, The semantic typology of pluractionality (2007), chapter 4 (for full references see
the Bibliography on page 299).",[90]
"9.2Commands, exhortations, and requestsThree common strategies are used in commands and in requests for people to do something. They are listed in (154).
¹ Pronouns (like nek) are almost always preverbal.
² Note also that kue negeneech is explicitly marked as contrastive via the particle tue’, which can be translated
“but” and highlights a contrasting noun.",[121]
"Additional verb types/576.5 Attributive verbs
Every inﬂected Yurok verb has attributive forms. These have distinctive endings and a
set of uses that sometimes correspond to modiﬁers in English, sometimes to nouns, and
sometimes to phrases with meanings like “the one who steals” or “the boy who ran fast”.
The attributive phrases that are formed with attributive verbs can be understood
informally as descriptive phrases; they serve to characterize or describe a noun or a
referent under discussion.¹
The most common patterns for forming attributive verbs are shown in Table 6.8.e-classe-classo-class or

As the table shows, all ﬁrst-person (singular and plural) attributives have an ending
-oh, similar to the 1 pl ending of indicative verbs. Second-person attributives distinguish singular and plural endings, and have different patterns for e-class vs. o- and ooclass verbs. Note that oo-class verbs with 3 sg forms in -ok’w have 3 sg attributives in
-okween. Collective ﬁrst- and second-person attributives are identical to indicatives; the
third-person forms are distinct.
By far the most common attributive forms in use are third-person forms (singular,
plural, and collective). Their use to modify nouns is illustrated in (61–62). Given ﬁrst,
in (61), are examples with the pattern Attributive + Noun.²
(61)Attributive + Noun
(a)kerkue’yermercheen laayekws
“a crooked trail” (kerkue’yermercherk’ “I walk crookedly”)(b) nuemee peleen leyes
“a very big snake” (peloyek’ “I am big”)FS 1980 (PP)AF 2001 (JB)¹ Attributive verbs are used to form what linguists call relative clauses. A relative clause that consists of only
an attributive verb can function like an agent noun, the equivalent of English baker, hunter, etc. Note that
a number of details of attributive formation and usage are omitted here. More information can be found in
R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958) and Howard Berman’s “Subordinate clauses in Yurok: A preliminary
report” (1972); for full references see the Bibliography on page 299.
² Note that che’lonee in (61c) is strictly speaking a passive attributive, as che’lee’ is passive.","[87, 88]"
