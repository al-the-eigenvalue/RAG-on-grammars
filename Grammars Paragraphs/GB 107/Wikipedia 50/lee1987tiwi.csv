particle kalu (wu ) ( TT : karluwu ) . Thi s form ( an Iwa idj a loan) i s used more
often than the form anuka ( f rom the trad i tional form arnuka ) , though this

independent verb or a verbal complex there i s generally no subj unct i ve or
irrealis prefixes on the verb a s in TT ( see 4 . 2 . 9 . 2 , p . 1 98 ) , except in s ome

There are one or two tag que s t ions which e i ther do not occur in TT or
whi ch seem to have a dif fe rent meaning . One such tag is wayana? (waya ' now' +
-ana Q? ) , whi c h Godfrey says occurs in TT as meaning 'Do you now understand ? ' .
I t may have this meaning in some o f the ins tances in the MT data , but often i t
j us t seems to b e used much as the t a g que s t i on i s u s e d in English , to evoke a
res ponse to a statement or to seek con f i rma t i o n .

In gene ra l , the ordering can be looked at in te rms of ' theme ' meaning roughly
' the thing be ing talked about ' , as sugge sted by Osbo rne ( 1 9 7 4 : 62 ) . Osbo rne
says that the ' t heme always comes f i r s t in a sentence , regard l e s s of i ts292
synt a c t i c func t ion' ( 62 ) . Thi s , in gene ra l , would s e e m to b e true b u t the
s i tuation i s a l i t tle more complex than this statement imp l ie s . Of ten when a
topic is being int roduced for the f i r s t t ime it occurs in the theme pos i t ion ,
as in example 6- 1 0 1 though normally new informa t i on is not ini t i a l in the
clause or sentence . 4 7

Pipiyanyumi l i , there we would make camp . '
New info rmat ion norma l l y occurs fina l l y , o r near final l y , in the clause
and this new info rmat ion can then become the theme of the next clause . 48

These words occur before an inf lected
independent verb o r before the free f o rm verb ( e i ther alone or in a verbal
complex ) . 7 5

It
only by o l� e r voung people and wuta/wurra by chi ldren (with this sense ) .
may be tha t the use of wuta/wurra may be a hypercorrection ( likening i t to the
use of wuta/wurra ) for accompaniment in MT ) . There is really no formal
d i s t inction between ins t rument and accompaniment exce pt that inst rument may be
unmarked ( see a l s o ( 2 ) , p . 2 5 2 ) . When the inst rument i s an unmarked NP the re
may be ambi gui ty , but the context normal l y makes it clear that an instrument is

It would seem that the use of the

CLAUSE S AND SENTENCES6. 1OVERVIEWI def ine a clause as a group of words which function together as a uni t ,
having one main predication ( ve rbal o r non-ve rbal ) .
It may func t i on alone as a
simple sentence or as part of a large r , more complex sentence . A clause may
occur wi thin one of the con s t i tuents of a sentence or ano ther clause , f o r
ins tance : a s a relat ive clause within one of the nominal arguments of a clause
( see 5 . 1 . 1 , p . 22 2 , and 6 . 9 . 1 , p . 29 5 ) , as a temporal clause within t he Temporal
con s t i tuent of a clause o r sentence ( see 6 . 9 . 3 , p . 29 9 ) or as a complement
clause f o llowing a verb o f speech , 'want ing ' , e t c . ( s ee 6 . 9 . 7 , p . 304 ) .
In TT , the re may also be two log ical predicat ions encoded in the ver b ,
when a verbal o r s t a t ive incorporated f o rm occurs in the nucleus s t ructure of
the verb ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 2 ) , p . 1 60 ) . Howeve r , the se can be regarded as adding a

late ral con s t i tuen ts ( see be low and d i scuss i on in 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 2 ) , p . 1 60 ) , be ing
similar to par t i c ipial phrases in English , such as 'being f ri ghtened ' .

i . e . ind i ca t i ve , subj unc t i ve , impe rat ive /hortat ive and interrogati ve . The
d i f f e rence s be tween the se are not very s ignif i cant and a re d i scussed mo re fully
in sub-sect ions 6 . 3 , 6 . 6 and 6 . 7 ; ( ii ) accord ing to the type of predicate
s t ructure .
There are three main types of predicate s , giving r i se to three main
types of clause s : ( a ) active verbal clause with a predicate cons i s t ing o f a
verb o r a verbal complex , as descr ibed in 4 . 3 , p . 20 3 ; "" ( b ) a s t a tive verbal
clause with a predicate cons i s t ing of a complement plus a verb ; ( c ) a
non-ve rbal clause with a p redicate cons i s t ing of j u s t a complement . Each of
the types ( a ) and ( c ) can be sub-divided accord ing to the relationship of the
nominal a rguments to the predicate .
The term 'predica te ' is used as a syntac t i c �erm , as i t is no rmally used
in tagmemics rather than logic ( cf . Longacre 1 9 6 4 : 35f wi th Lyons 1 9 7 7a : 1 48f ) .
Longacre d i s t inguishes cen t red and non-cent red clause s . The former are those
245246
which ' contain bound subj e c t s w i t h the i r predicates and such subj e c t s must
o ccur whe ther or not a substant ive phrase also expresses subj ect e l sewhere in
the c laus e ' ( 1 9 64 : 35 ) . Non-centred clauses are ones in whi ch the pred icate
does not contain a bound subj ect .
In TT , verbal c lauses are centred clauses
whi le non-verbal clauses are non-centre d .
The a c t ive verbal clauses can be sub-d ivided into : t rans i t ive ,
d i t rans i t ive , semi-trans i t ive and intrans i t ive clauses . A trans i t i ve clause
has a verb which requi res a se cond nominal argument , and this a rgument , the
d i r e c t obj ect ( DO ) , is obligatorily marked on the verb by a direct obj ect
person prefix ( o r by the choice of a trans i t ive subj e c t-tense-obj ect prefix , in
the case of third singular obj e c t s , see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 1 ) , p . 1 5 7 and 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 , p . 1 7 2 ) .
A semi-trans i t ive clause has a verb which requires a se cond nominal argument
but this argument , the se condary obj ect ( SO ) , i s not encoded by a ve rbal
pre f i x . 1 A d i t rans i tive clause has a ve rb which requires three nominal
a rgument s , of which two are encoded on the ve rb by personal prefixes , the
subj ect ( 5 ) and the direct obj ect , whi le the thi rd , the se condary obj e c t , i s
not s o encode d . The d i re c t obj ect i s animate ( be ing the recipient or source ,
depending on the ve rb ) and the se condary obj ect is normally inanimate . An
int rans i t ive clause i s one which requires only one nominal argument , the
subj e c t ( 5 ) .
The d i s t inct ion ma de between trans i t ive , ditran s i t ive , semi-tran s i t ive and
int rans i t ive at clause leve l is d i f fe rent f rom that made between trans i t ive ,
and non-trans i t ive ( feminine and general ) verb stems in the verbal
cons truction. Tran s i t ive verb s tems occur in both t rans i tive and d i t rans i t ive
verb s . Non-trans i t ive ve rb stems ( both feminine and gene ral ) occur in
semi -trans i tive and int rans i t ive verbs , though , in general , feminine s tems tend
to be in semi-tran s i tive ve rbs ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 1 ) , p . 1 5 7 ) . These clause types and
the reasons for separat ing them a re di s cussed more fully in 6 . 3 . 1 . 1 , p . 2 67 , and
6 . 3 . 2 . 1 , p . 27 0 .
The non-ve rbal clauses can be divided into sub-types accord ing to the
relationship be tween the subj ect and the p redicate , which cons i s ts solely of a
complement . A s tative non-ve rbal clause expre sses a relat ionship between the
subj e c t and predicate of 'being' ( loca t i on , description or ident i f i c a t i o n ) and
a pos s e s s i ve non-ve rbal clause expre sses a relat ionship of 'having ' . The re i s
no d i f ference in the surface structure of t h i s l a t t e r type of clause wi th the
non-ve rbal s t a t ive clauses expressing ident i f ication. The non-ve rbal c lauses
are related to the s t a t ive verbal clause and to some semi-transit ive ve rbal
c lause s with verbs o f 'having' respective l y . These are d i scussed in mo re
de t a i l in 6 . 5 , p . 285 .","[252, 253, 254]"
"2and ind i re c t obj ect , tense , aspec t , mood , t ime of day and location . There may
also be incorporated f orms in the verb which may be e i the r nominal or ve rbal in
char ac t e r . The se forms are different f rom the corre sponding free form nouns
and verbs . ( See also Cape l l 1 9 6 7 : 43 . )
Thi s can be i l lu s t rated by a sentence which cons i s t s of a single ve rb .
Example ( 1- 1 )
a- mpishe- niNON-PAST - LOCwa t u- wujingimamorn- DURATIVE -with -jirrakirningi - yangurlimay - amil ight- walk- MOVEMENT' She ( the sun ) is shining ove r the re in the morning . '
( Li t : She i s walking ove r there in the morning with a l ight . )
The Tiwi used by young people i s not polysynthe t i c .
In the i r speech mos t
of the verbal inflect ion i s lost , with periphras t i c , analy t i c ve rb fo rms
replacing the complex inf lec ted verbs . The language has become mainly
i s o l a t ing . Non-ve rbal concepts which are expressed in the verb in the
trad i t i onal language ( s ome time s by a f ree form word as we l l ) are expres sed only
by a free form word (a noun , pronoun , adverb , locative or time word ) . Thi s is
ill�stutQd.:Ln exa\1lPJ.�. ( 1""':.2J , which is how example ( 1 - 1 ) might be rendered in
the speech of young people .
In example ( 1-2 ) , the word s , japinari 'morning '
and kutawu ' there ' are Trad i t i ona l Tiwi words which could also have occurred in
examp le ( 1 - 1 ) . However , in example ( 1 - 2 ) word s and cons tructions f rom English
(or Pidgin Engl i s h ) are also u s e d .

ground s , w i t h no morphological b a s e s for d i s t i ngui s i ng them. Some of the se
classes are : conj unc t ions and int roduce r s , prepo s i t ions and interj e c t ions .
These c l a s s e s are not d i scussed in d e t a i l in this chapte r , but some a re dealt
with in appropriate sect ions in later chapte r s .
Conj unc t i ons are of two type s ,
those j oining phrases ( d i scussed in 5 . 1 . 3 , p . 2 3 0 ) and those j oining clauses
within sentence s .
Introducers are those words whi ch introduce sentence s .
Ne i t he r clause conj unc t ions no r int roduce rs are d i s cussed in this work. 7 8 In
TT , there a re very few prepo s i t ions and the i r func t ions a re mainly relat ing

In MT , the class of prepo s i t ions is expanded by
the int roduc t ion of some l oan prepo s i t ions and the i r func t i ons a re expanded to
include gramma t i cal r e l a t i ons othe r than locat ive .
Both TT and MT pre p o s i t ions

"6.2CLAUSE CONSTITUENTSThe clause con s t i tuents in all var i e t i e s of Tiwi can be ' laye r e d ' in
groups depending upon the i r relat ionship to the predicate . There are arguments
which can be furthe r grouped into core and non-core a rgument s , and the re are
lateral con s t i tuent s . The definit ions and c r i t e r i a for the argument s of a
clause vary be tween TT and MT and the se are di scussed in the f o l lowing
sub-sect ions .
The lateral con s t i tuents ' convey spe c i f i c informat ion about the
c i r cums t ance s of the action expressed in the predicate' ( Glasgow and Garner
1 980 : 4 1 ) , 2 but , in gene ral , are not argument s of the ve rb and , in the case of
TT , are not usua l l y marked on the ver b . These lateral cons t i tuents are
bas i c a l ly the same for TT and MT , though the mani f e s tation of them may d i ff e r .
The se cons t i tuents are : locat ive ( Loc ) , temporal ( T ) , manner ( Mnr ) , modal
(Mdl ) , negat i ve ( Neg ) and reason ( Reas ) . 3 Locat i ve may be cons idered an
a rgument o f the clause with verbs of mo tion but the re i s no f o rmal d i f f e rence
between the se manifestat ions of loca t i ve from locative in other clause s ( except
for mot ion ' f rom' in MT ; see 6 . 2 . 3 . 1 , p . 2 60 ) .
Mos t o f the non-predicate consti tuents of a clause may occur as
appos i t i onal phrases , as d i s cus sed in Chapt e r 5 ( 5 . 1 . 4 , p . 2 3 3 and 5 . 2 , p . 2 3 5 ) .
Norma l l y in these cases , each succeed ing e lement within tha t cons t i tuent
becomes more speci f i c in meaning ( see examples 5-30 , 3 1 , p . 23 5 ) . These
appo s i t i onal phrases may be inte r rupted by other c l ause cons t i tuent s , but the
reason for thi s is no t always clear without mo re extens ive inve s t i gation ( some
reasons are d i scussed b r i e f l y in 6 . 8 , p . 29 1 ) .",[255]
"6.2.3.4RKASOIfIn gene ral , reason in TT is encoded by a reason clause ( see 6 . 9 . 5 , p . 30 1 )
but the re are some cases whe re reason i s indicated by an incorporated f o rm
within the ve rb , as in example 6-39 ( see also 6- 1 , p . 24 5 ) .
I have no examples
in my corpus o f a clause cons t i tuent ( e i the r unmarked NP o r pronominal , or a
prepos i t ional phras e ) funct i oning as a reason con s t i tuent .
Example

'we scratch be caus e of the ants '(b)- r; - �
- kiringayi
we ( incl ) - CV - grass - s c ratch
'we scratch because of the grassngaThe re are some examp les in MT of a reason phrase with the prepos i t i on pili
which come s f rom the TT reason conj unc t ion meaning 'because ' ( see 6 . 9 . 5 ,
p . 30 1 ) . Thi s type of phrase may be possible in TT as wel l but I have no
examp l e s in my corpus .

with the prepos i t ion prom/from marking reason .

are ind i cated .
In TT , they are defined by cross -re fe rencing ( o r the lack of
i t ) to verbal a f f ixes , whi l e in MT, they a re mainly defined syntact ically by
word order and /or by the marking of the NP in the clause by a prepos i t ion ( o r
t h e lack o f s u c h marking ) .
In MT , the unmarked NPs a re d i s t inguished
synt a c t ically and seman t i c a l l y .
In more formal MT , the subj ect may be
d e t e rmined as in TT , i . e . by cross-refe rence with the subj e ct-tense prefix in
the verb .
In Casual MT , it is mainly d i s t inguished by pos i t ion and
semant i c a l l y ( see a l s o 6 . 8 , p . 29 1 , re word order in the clause ) .
The re i s no one -to-one correspondence between the con s t i tuents o f the
clause in TT and MT . The correspondences be tween the two a re shown in Table

and complement i se r , ngini , as are purpose clauses . The meaning of ngini is
very gene ral , being able to be translated as ' if ' , ' that ' , ' that i s ' .
Some of
the uses o f ngini have been di scussed el sewhe re : as a masculine s ingular
re l a t ive pronoun ( 3 . 3 . 3 , p . 1 1 3 , and 6 . 9 . 1 . 1 , p . 295 ) , as a complement i s e r
f o ll owing verbs of speech ( 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 , p . 2 7 8 ) ; and in purpose clauses ( 6 . 9 . 6 ,
p . 30 2 ) .
Some other examples of the uses of ngini as a subordinate conj unc tion
are given here ( in some cases the ngini i s optional ) :

' e i ght ' ( s i x p l u s two ) .
The form walimani i s obviously derived f rom the shape of the wri t ten

The form for 'ten' is a compound

Whi l e many young people seem to know t h e T T numeral s , or rather s ome

'one woman'( RJ 1 2 )Since yati i s used for feminine human nouns as wel l as masculine one s by
young people (who have developed a gender d i s t inc t i on in the se human nouns , as
evidenced by the i r use of agreement between other adj e c t i ve s and the nouns the y
mod i f y ) , i t would seem that this represents a change in the language and not
j us t a developmental s tage of language acqui s i t ion .
It i s not clear whe the r the re i s any d i s t inct i on made between human and
non-human forms in the forms for the nume rals ' two ' and ' three ' . The gend e r
d i s tinction for non-human nouns h a s ce rtainly been l o s t in the se numeral s . For
human nouns and nouns for s ome animal s , young people , a t least older young
people , seem to use the form yu (wu )rrara ' two ' and for non-human nouns , the
form yirrara .

mani f e s t e d by a temporal word ( though the temporal words used may vary f rom
s tyle to s tyle ( see 3 . 5 . 2 , p . 1 30 ) ; by a temporal phrase ( 5 . 2 . 2 , p . 23 9 ) , by a
temporal clause ( 6 . 9 . 3 , p . 299 ) or by an appo s i ti onal phrase , with a combina t i on
of some of the s e . The pos i t ion of the temporal may vary , though it occurs mos t
f requen t l y e i ther ini tially o r finally. The temporal cons t i tuent may occur in
all types of clauses , both ve rbal and non-ve rba l , though the re a re not many
examples in the stat ive verbal clauses and the non-verbal clause s .
In TT some temporals may be marked on the ve rb , with a poss ible exte rnal
temporal as wel l . The temporals marked on the verb are (w)ati - ' in the
morning ' , ki - 'in the evening' ( see 4 . 2 . 5 , p . 1 8 6 ) , and the prefixes ( wu )ni - and
Ci (ngi ) - with the meaning 'a long time in time ' ( see 4 . 2 . 4 , p . 1 8 2 ) .

"3.5. 1LOCArIVESThe p icture with regard to the locat ive forms in TT is somewhat confused ,
probably due to the d i f fe rences between what are regarded as the 'prope r ' use
o f the te rms and the i r ac tual us e . There are two type s of locative s , one type
in which the relative d i s t ance from the speaker and / o r addressee i s important ,
and pos i t i onal locat i ves which give the pos i t ion relat ive to so�e othe r obj e c t ,
such as yilaruwu ' inside ' .
With regard to the ' d i s tance ' locative s the re are d i f f e rent se t s . The set
upon which the anaphor i c locat ive proforms are bui l t have three points of
refe rence , as with demons tratives ( see 3 . 3 . 5 . 1 , p . 1 1 7 ) : ngarra 'here (where the
speaker i s ) ' , ngaji ' there (where the addressee i s ) ' and ngarruwu ' the re ( whe re
someone e l se i s , at a re lat ive d i s tance ) ' . These meanings apply also to the
anapho r i c forms , but in both cases , particularly in the anaphoric forms , the
meaning of the second has been extended to mean ' to / at that place / thing / pe rson'
(whe re the place o r person i s in focus rather than the d i s t ance as with the
third form ) .
In Eng l i sh there i s ' a very close connexion between the de i c t i c func t i on
of the demons tratives , ' t hi s ' and ' t ha t ' ; and the locat ive adve rbs , 'he r e ' and
' the re ' ( Lyons 1 9 7 7 ( b ) : 2 7 6 ) . Presumably this is true of othe r languages as
we l l .
The basic forms i n TT are normally given i n reply t o the que s t ion ,
'Where ( i s something /someone ) ? ' and mean 'here ( o r the re ) it is , . 7 9

I n the speech o f young people the re are some examp l e s of ngarra ( or the
changed form arra ) meaning 'he r e ' but there are no examp les of ngaji ( or aji )
and only one or two of ngarruwu ( o r arruwu ) which seems to have l o s t the
implicat i on of d i s t ance and appears to mean simply ' there ' compared to 'he r e '

reduced t o /w/ , vi z . , awungarra > awarra , awungaji > awaji , and awungarruwu >

"3197.4PHRASES7.4. 1HOUR PHRASESThe re are relat ively few changes in the s t ructure of the Noun Phrases ,
though there are some :
( i ) The att r ibutive noun phrase is basically the same s t ructure in MT as
in TT . The d i ffe rences are mainly in the words which may o ccur in each
mod i f i e r pos i t ion . For ins tance , predicatives may be used as descript ive
adj ect ives in MT but not in TT .
In the data on the speech of young chil dren
there are no examples of rela tive clauses 2 ( see 5 . 1 . 1 , p . 22 1 ) .
( i i ) Po s s e s s ive Phrases in MT may have a modif i e r , o ther than the
Pos s e s s o r before the Head noun , whi ch does not appear to happen in TT ( see

The se s t a t ive ve rbal clause s could be included with the active verbal

5 . 2 . 1 , p . 23 6 ) , an appos i t ional locative phrase ( see 5 . 2 , p . 2 3 5 ) or by a
locat ive clause ( see 6 . 9 . 2 , p . 298 )
( 1 ) Trad i t i onal Tiwi
The locat ive cons t i tuent may indicate mot i on ' t o ' or ' f rom' with the verbs
o f mo t i on and locat ion ' at ' , ' in ' , 'on ' , 'ne a r ' e t c . with non-motion verbs .
There are no formal difference s between the s e diffe rent types of locat ion .
Loc a t i on ' a t ' may be marked j us t by the verbal loca tive prefix (wu )ni - , ' a t a
d i s t ance ' or by the verbal s t ance prefix Ci (ngi ) - 'out bush' ( see 4 . 2 . 4 ,
p . I 8 2 ) . There may be a locat ive expre ssed exte rnally to the ve rb a s we l l as
thes e verbal prefixe s . These pref ixe s are used only with the se sense s and are
not used t o s ignal a general locative ( cf . the use of the concomi tative marker
to s i gnal a concomi tat ive 6 . 2 . 1 . 2 ( 2 ) , p . 2 5 2 ) . With mot ion verbs the pref i x
(wu )ni - may a l s o b e used to mean ' t o he re ' . In this case there may be an261
external locat ive , a l s o meaning ' ( t o ) he re ' , b u t it i s mo re usual for an
external locat ive ( cooccurring wi th the verbal pre f i x ) to indicate motion
' f rom ' , 2 1 as in example 6-29 ( a ) . The s t ance pre f i x , meaning 'out bush ' , may
a l s o be used with motion ve rbs .
For othe r examples see the examples
Only a few examples are given he re .
in 6 . 3 . 1 . 1 , p . 2 6 7 and 6 . 3 . 2 . 1 , p . 2 7 0 . For examples of loca t i ve phr a s e s see
5 . 2 . 1 , p . 23 6 and for examples o f locat ive c lauses see 6 . 9 . 2 , p . 2 9 8 .

( 2 ) Modern Tiwi
In MT the locat ive ind icat ing motion ' f rom' is d i f f e rent f rom other
locatives , in that it is always marked by the prepo s i tion prom or from ( see
a l s o 5 . 2 . 1 , p . 23 9 ) .
Example
(a)(b)( 6-30 )(MT )kam pak pir�m�from TuMay1come back they : did from Two Mile
'They came back from Two Mile . '( CK1 0 )arra kurrup from warraf rom wate r
he
j ump
'He j umped from the wate r . '( RJ 1 2 )In MT , the re are s ome examples o f the direct i onal pre f i x , but i n many
cases this seems to be fused with the stem -uriyi 'go ' to give -nuriyi ' come '
( s ee 4 . 2 . 4 . 2 � p . 1 8 5 ) . Whe re i t does occur there is often a mo t i on ' f rom ' in
the claus e . 2L
Exampleyi( 6-3 1 )(MT )- nuriyi muwa- morti from Mi1ikapitif rom M .
your : & : my - son
he : P - come
(AP28 )
' Ou r s on came f rom Mil ikapi ti . '
Othe r locat ives i n MT occur a s unmarked nominal s o r a s preposi t i onal
phras e s with the prepo s i t i on kapi or ka ( s ee 5 . 2 . 1 , p . 2 3 6 ) . The re appears to
be a greater tendency to \ 1 � e a prep o s i t ion before a locat ive noun than in TT ,
as in example 6-3 2 ( b ) and ( c ) .","[268, 269]"
"Cha p t e r 3
WORD CLA S S E S3. 1IRTRODUCTIONTradit ional Tiwi has a number of word classes or parts of speech , some of
which may be divided into sub-clas ses . The way in which the se a re classi f i ed
and named differs f rom Osbo rne in some cases ( 1 9 7 4 : 58-5 9 ) and bas i c a l l y follows
Dixo n ' s categories for mos t Aus tral ian languages ( Dixon 1 9 80 : 2 7 1 ) . The two
maj o r word classes are nomina l s , subdivided into nouns , kin nouns , adj e c t i ves
and numerals , and verbals subdivided into inflected verbs and free form verbs .
Othe r full word classes are predicatives , loca t i ves , tempora l s , adverbs ,
p a r t i c l e s and interj e c t i ons . The function word classes a re pronominals ,
prepos i t ions , sentence int roduce rs and conjunc t ions .
The classes and sub-classes are d e t e rmined on syntac t i c , morphological and
seman t i c ground s . Verbal construct ions in both MT and TT are de scribed .
Prepo s i t ions are d i s cussed briefly in Chapte r 4 and Chapte r 5 ( Clauses ) .
Conj unc t ions and sent ence int roducers are not d i s cussed in the work .
The catego r i e s for Modern Tiwi are , in gene ra l , the same as tho se for
Trad i t ional Tiwi , the main d i fferences be ing within the classes or sub-classe s .
Some classe s , such a s inf lected verbs , are much reduced i n s i z e , while othe r
classe s , such as free ve rbs , are expanded .","[84, 85]"
"The change s which have taken p lace in Tiwi must be a t t ributed to language
shi f t .
I t seems to be wel l accepted tha t , as Samarin ( 1 9 7 1 : 1 2 7 ) says ,
' reduc tion in l anguage use probably always has s ome repe rcus sions on language
outpu t ' .
Dor i an ( 1 9 8 1 a : 1 1 4 ) not e s that :
Whe re the death of a language is extreme l y rapid and, occurs
by the way of the extinction of the people who use i t , i t
may happen that the last speakers o f the language are fully
f l uent and remain in perfect control of the phono l ogy ,
lexicon and grammar of the i r mothe r-tongue . Whe re language
shi f t is taking p l a ce , howeve r , so that a new l anguage is
gradual l y replacing the original language of a communi ty ,
wi thout the extinc t i on of a people , it is common to f ind
speakers of qui te d i f fe rent abi li ty among the res idual
popula t i on which s t i l l spe aks the older t ongue .",[351]

reduction w i t h compensatory expansion. The re a r e some case s in which the re
appears to be a decrease in the refe rential potential of the language ( i . e .
overall reduction ) , par t i cularly in the loss o f the mood prefixes , for which
the re appears to be no sub s t i tution. This loss of categories with no
compensatory gain el sewhe re is common in language death situa t i ons . Howeve r ,
the lack o f examples o f modal express i ons ( such as , 'should ' , ' ought ' , 'mus t ' )
may be due t o the type of data collected for MT ( i . e . no hortatory type s of
d i s course ) . 49
Al s o , unlike Trudg i l l ' s f indings for Arvani t ika ( 1 9 7 7 : 40 ) , there i s a
greater numb e r of prepo s i t ions in MT than in TT ( 7 . 4 . 2 ) , though not as many as
in Eng l i sh ( e i ther SAE or TE ) .
I t seems that in mos t cases of language death des cribed in the l i t e ra ture
the decaying language has remained a re cognisable versi on of the language
( though abe rran t ) and the var i e t i e s are mutual ly intelligible . 50 Dorian
( 1 9 8 1 a ) says that among the semi-speake rs of ESG there was 'almo st perfect
pass ive control of ESG ' . Trudg i l l ( 1 9 7 7 : 35 ) says that there i s a certain
amount of mutual intel l igibi l i ty between Arvani t ika and its parent language ,
Albanian , that Arvan i t ika speakers l i s t ened to and und e rs tood a great deal of
Albanian broadcas t s . 5 1
Thi s i s no t the case in Tiwi . The re i s some overlap between the two
codes . Howeve r , al though young people ' s comprehension of TT is greater than
the i r product ion , few young people , par t i cularly chi ldren , can unqe r s tand much
of the TT spoken by older people among themselves or the stories told ( or
wri t ten) in TT . One twenty year old girl commented that she could not
unde r s tand he r fathe r when he spoke in 'hard ' Tiwi . Mo st older people
unders tand MT to a cons iderable extent but this may be because they und e r s tand
s ome Eng l i s h ( SAE and / o r TE ) and so unde rstand the English loans in MT . MT i s
gene rally thought of a s ' h a l f and hal f ' and n o t really Tiwi . 52 It is doubtful
that a TT speaker with no knowledge of English o r Pidgin English would
recognise MT as being a type of Tiwi ( though he would be able to see
Tiwi-de rived words in i t ) ; consequently he would unders tand l i t t le of i t .","[357, 358]"
"6. 2 . 1ARGUMKHTS OF THE CLAUSE IH TKADITIOHAL TIWIIn TT , the clause may cons i s t o f j us t a ve r b , s ince mo s t of the arguments
of the verb may be indicated in the verb in some way ( or , whe re they are no t ,
they may be clear f rom the context ) , o r there may be refe rences to t he
argument s of the verb externa l l y to the verb .
Some of these nominal a rguments are encoded in the verb by a p r e f ix
ind icat ing the pe rson and numbe r ( and in the case of third per son singul a r ,
a l s o gende r ) . The se are : subj e ct ( S ) , di rect obj e c t ( nO ) and ind i re ct obj e ct
( 10 ) .
The se argument s are re f e r red to as core argument s . Other arguments ,
r e f e r red to as non-core argument s , are e i the r :248
( i ) requi red or implied by the semantics of the verb but are not encoded
on the verb by a personal pref i x , viz secondary obj ect ( SO ) and ins t rument
( In ) ,
( i i ) signalled within the verb by the pre sence of the ' concomi tat ive
'
marke r , thus showing they are requi red by this par t i cular f o rm o f the verb ,
v i z . concomitat ive ( Con ) ( c f . 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 3 ) , p . 1 6 5 ) .
Al l these nominal arguments of the verb may occur exte rna lly to the ve rb
as an unmarked noun phrase ( 5 . 1 , p . 22 1 ) , a personal o r impe rsonal pronoun
( 3 . 3 . 1 -3 , p . 1 00ff ) , a defini tive o r demonstra t ive ( 3 . 3 . 5 , p . 1 1 7 ) , a pronominal
phrase or a combinat ion of some of these as an appos i t ional NP ( 5 . 1 . 4 , p . 23 3 ) .

"326Some language s , al though n o t completely extinc t , a r e dying , having only a
few speake rs le f t . As in other case s , l inguists in the past have been mainly
conce rned with recording the 'pure ' f orms of these dying languages without
conce rning themse lves with the forms spoken by young people . However , Douglas
( 1 9 7 6 ) b r i e f ly describes the Nyungar language of south-western Aus t r al i a , which
is probably a s i mpl i f ied vers ion of the trad i t i onal language , and the modern
form Neo-Nyungar , which is basically an Aboriginal Engl ish with a sma t t e r ing of
Nyungar words . Aus tin ( 1 98 1 ) looks at the changes in some e a s t e rn Aus t ral i an
languages which are dying . At least one of these appears to be a case of
Speaking Gamilaraay 'now means inse r ting invar iable
conve rgence with Engl i sh .
lexi cal i tems into what are otherwise English sentence s ' (Aus tin 1 9 8 1 : 3 1 ) .
Even in s i tuations where an Aboriginal language i s s t i l l used to a
considerable extent , the chi ldren ' s speech appears to be changed in many case s .
In an informal survey conducted among S . I . L . lingui s t s working in d i ff e rent
Aus t ralian language s , a number commented on the inc reasing use of Eng l i sh by
chi l d r e n .
In a t least one c a s e ( Nyanguma r t a ) t h i s was to the exclusion of the
trad i t ional language , though some can s t i l l 'hear ' ( i . e . unde rs tand ) i t .
In
some case s , changes in the language spoken by the chi ldren have been noted ,
though no t studied systematically in mos t ins tances .
Some changes noted are :
the increased use of Eng l i sh loans and the regularisat ion of grammatical
affixes ( Gugu-Yalanj i , Gurindj i ) . 2
Even whe re the European contact with Aus t ralian Abor i g ines has been
r e l a t ively peaceful , qui t e a lot of coercion appe ars to have been used in many
cases ( see Dixon 1 980 : 7 7- 7 9 , Bernd t and Bernd t 1 9 7 7 : 493-499 , Elkin
1 9 7 4 : 3 6 2-364 ) . Elkin ( 1 9 7 4 : 3 6 4 ) says :
The Abo ri gine s , on the i r part , learnt that they could not
rid the i r various t ribal countries o f the whi te man , nor
take his possess ions with impuni ty , for they came off wors t
when faced with e i ther guns or courts . They the refore
gradually adapted themselves to the whi te man , with his
flocks and herd s , as a permanent factor in the environment .
Except for early clashes , there has been l i t t le re s i s tance by the
Abor igines to European ways and culture , with many Aboriginal people read i l y
accept ing the 'bene f i t s ' of civil i sat ion .
So , al though there has been
intermit tent vi olence and considerable coercion , the contact has resulted in

In general , the
resul t s appear to be different from those found by Dozie r with respe c t to the
e f f e c t of the type of culture contact on the culture and language ( see Doz i e r
1 9 64 ) . Perhaps other factors have played a more important part . A more

( 3 ) The extens i on o f the u s e o f the common auxiliary s t e m �i to replace the
l e s s common s tems such as -kirimi and -unga . Thi s a case of grammat i cal
analogy .
( 4 ) The regular i s a ti on of the three sets of subj ect -tense prefixe s of TT to the
one of MT is typical of the regularisa tion which occurs in normal language
change .
Other changes have to be more directly att ributed to extensive contact
with Engl ish and / o r Pidgin English ( to direct borrowing f rom them or to
analogical mod e l l ing on s t ructures within them ) .
The se change s , although given under the separate headings of Phonol ogy ,
Word classes , Clauses e tc . , are not discrete changes occurring independently of
each othe r . Change in the lexi con , through borrowing , introduces new phones or
phonemes into the language , leading to an expans ion in the phoneme inventor y .
There i s a corre sponding reduc t ion in the phoneme inventory through the loss of
some TT phonemes ( see 2 . 7 ) .
The se changes appear to be going on simultaneous ly. With the change in
culture , children and young people have had less exposure to the 'pure ' f o rm of
the language and so hear fewer occurrences of the sounds which are being
changed . Many young people seem to be aware of the ' prope r ' pronunc i a t i ons and
some t imes use them in the i r more formal speech or in writ ing . However , the i r
casual speech doe s not seem to b e affected by this awareness and many who a re
able to wri t e have d i f f i culty in spell ing words with post -alveolar consonants
In material wri t ten by young people there are a
and the ve lar f r i ca tive .
numbe r of examples of hype rcorre c t i o n , in which words are spe lt with
pos t -alveolar consonants whe re they do not occur in TT .
On the surface , it is not clear whe ther the int roduction of Engl ish loan
free form verbs has led to the loss of TT verb stems or vice ve rsa , or whe ther
the l o s s o f the TT ve rbal inf l e c t i ons has led to more grammat i cal r e l a t i ons
being ind i cated by nouns or preposi t ional phrases and to tense , mood and aspect
being s hown by separate words , or the o ther way around , or whe ther the changes
have been simu lt aneous .
The re seems to be a 'vicious circle ' ope rat ing . As more Eng l i s h loan
verbs are int roduced mo re verb stems a re los t , and as more verb stems a re l o s t
more Eng l i s h loan ve rbs a r e int roduce d .
Similarl y , a s the verb inf lection is
l o s t , the more rigid become s the word order as grammat i cal relati ons a re shown
by noun or prepos i t ional phrases . Also as more prepos i t i ons are int roduced or
the functions of exi s t ing p repq s i t i ons are expanded the more inf l e c t i on is l o s t
f rom t h e ve r b .
Both the l o s s o f some TT verb stems and the use o f Engl ish loan verbs are
Simi l a rly ,
apparent in the speech of middle-aged ( and even some olde r ) people .
some loss of verbal inf lect ion and the extension of the meanings of TT locat ive
prepos i t i ons have also been noted in the i r speech . The extent of these t r a i t s
has no t been s tudied i n detail .
MT is characte rised by the almost complete loss of TT verb stems and
verbal inf l e c t ions and by much l anguage 'mixing ' , wi th e lements derived from
both TT and Engl ish ( and /or Pidgin Engl i sh ) . MT seems to be an amalgamation of
TT and Eng l i s h . 5323
The que s t ion arises whe the r MT has developed f r om the speech of
middle-aged people through a process of language 'deat h ' , with the change s
being carried to a n ext reme and thus ne c e s s i t a t ing extensive borrowing , o r
whe the r i t has developed i n another way ( i . e . whe ther MT is a reduced or
s i mpl i f ied form of TT through gradual loss and repl acement by English , or
whe ther i t i s in fact an emerging new code deve loped from an ang l i c i s e d baby
talk Tiwi which has amalgamated forms and s t ructures f r om both TT and Eng l i sh
( and /or Pidgin Engl i s h » .

contact phenomena ( i . e . the types of s i tuations which are brought about by
language and culture contac t ) and language acqui s i t ion and the affect of the se

be l ow .
( 1 ) Dorian has discussed some ways i n which the speech o f semi-speake rs o f
Suthe rland Gae l i c (ESG) i s aber rant f rom that of fluent speake r s , such a s :
( i ) some loss of gender dis tincti ons ( Dorian 1 9 7 6 , 1 98 1 a : 1 24- 1 2 9 ,
147-148 ) ;
( i i ) some loss of case marking but with the semantic not ions being shown
in othe r ways , such as by prepositi onal phrases 3 9 ( Dorian 1 9 7 3 : 426-4 3 5 ,
1 98 1 a : 1 2 9-1 3 6 , 1 48 ) ;
( ii i ) reduc ti on of the tense system with no tendency to subst i tute
adverbial t ime marke rs ( Do rian 1 98 1 a : 1 38-14 1 , 1 50- 1 5 1 ) ;
( iv ) lo s s of on'e type o f pas s i ve ( Dorian 1 9 7 3 : 42 1 -4 2 6 ; 1 98 1 a : 1 42 - 1 44 ) ;
( v ) reduct i on of the lexi con , though a considerable number of ESG words
are re ta ined even by those who are unable to use them in a Gae l i c sentence
( Dorian 1 98 1 a : 1 4 5 - 1 4 6 ) . 40345She says
( 2 ) Do rian has said l i t tle about the interference of Eng l i sh on ESG.
( 1 980c : 25 ) that she has been surprised by how l i t t le s t ructural inte rfe rence
f rom Eng l i s h there is in the speech of semi -speakers . There i s a considerable
amount of lexical inte rfe rence but in this the more common s t rategy i s for
Engl ish l oans to be adapted t o Gae l i c morphology and morphophonol ogy ( Do rian
1 9 8 1 a : l 00 ) . Even in casual speech in which there i s a gre a t e r use of loan
wo rds , this is the case ( 1 9 8 1 a : l 0 l ) .
The use of loan words seems to vary from case to case in language deat h .
I n s ome cases there seem t o b e few loan words used , a s i n Nez Perce ( Aoki
1 9 7 1 ) ; and Kil iwa (Mixco 1 9 7 7 ) .
In other cases the use of loans i s ve r y common
and is seen as be ing tied up with the death of the language , as in We l sh
dialects ( B rea tnach 1 9 64 ) ; Tlaxclan Nahua t l (Hill and H i l l 1 9 7 7 ) ; Shoshoni
(Mi l l e r 1 9 7 1 ) ; Ormuri and Paraci (Ki e f f e r 1 9 7 7 ) and Arvanit ika ( Trud g i l l 1 9 7 7 ) .
Dorian ( 1 980c : 2 5 ) has noted that many accounts of languages that a re
facing extinction do s t r e s s the inf luence of the dominant language on the dying
language ( f o r ins tance , Cos t e l l o ' s ( 1 9 7 8 ) account of Pennsylvanian German ) .
( 3 ) Dre s s le r ( 1 9 7 2 ) , on studying the phonological change in Bre ton in a part of
Lowe r-Bri t t any , concluded tha t :
( i ) An optional rule in the speech of an older gene ration is l o s t in the
d i sintegrat ing speech of a younger gene ra t ion ( 1 9 7 2 : 4 5 2 ) .
( i i ) The gradual l o s s of words ( ' lexical fading ' ) in which a phonological
rule occurs results in the eventual loss of the rule i t s e l f ( 1 9 7 2 : 45 2 ) .
( i i i ) 'Uncer tainty in the competence of one language does not nece s s a r i l y
resul t in the adoption of rules of the victorious language , rathe r i t results
in f ree variation inc luding the int roduc t ion of new variants ' ( 1 9 7 2 : 4 54 ) .
( iv ) 'Re s t r i c t i on of the use of the decaying language to fewer and fewer
speech s i tua t i ons resu l t s in "" s tyl i s t ic shrinkage "" , i . e . the conf l a ti on of
( 1 9 7 2 : 4 54 ) .
various social s tyles or of various s low and fast speech s tyles .
( 4 ) H i l l ( 1 9 7 3 , 1 9 7 8 ) has found in he r study of the Cupeno and Lui seno
languages of Cal i fornia that a l i ngui s t i c feature accompanying the reduct i on in
func t ional range i s the reduct ion in frequency of subord inate clauses .
She
c i t e s various l ingu i s t s who have f ound this phenomenon in o ther cases involving
reduction of funct ion or language death (Hill 1 9 7 3 : 46-7 ) . 4 1
( 5 ) Trudgil l ( 1 9 7 7 ) has l ooked a t the types of proce s s e s involved i n the
changes in Arvani tika , an Albanian dialect in Greece , which appears to be a
dying language . He has l ooked at the changes in re l a t i on to t he proce s s e s
involved in othe r mixed languages , particularly creo le s . H e has label led wha t
i s happening in Arvani t ika as 'creolisat i on in reve r se ' , t he sociol inguis t i c
j us t i f i ca t ion f o r this being that the si tuation dea l t with involves the ' lo s s
o f i t s native speake r s , b y a language ' whe reas creol i s a t i on involves the
'acqui s i t i on of nat ive speakers by a language ' ( Trud gi l l 1 9 7 7 : 33 ) ( c f . Sankoff
and Laberge 1 9 7 4 ) . He considers a number of types of grammatical changes in
the language to dete rmine whe ther 'creolisat ion in reve r se ' is an appropr iate346
t e rm lingui s t i cally as wel l . MUhlhHus ler ( 1 9 7 4 ) has shown that the four
feature s : reduc tion ( o r impove rishment ) , simp l i f i cat ion , s tabil i ty and
uninte l l i g i b i l i ty 42 can be used in the typological clas s i f i ca t ion of vari ous
kinds o f mixed languages . He says ( 1 980 : 2 1 ) :
Reduction in s tructure or impoverishment comprises those
proce s s e s that lead to a decrease in the referential or
non-re f e rential potential of a language .
Simp l i f i ca t i on
means that a language i s made e i ther more regular or l e s s
marked .
Using the se features , a creole is characterised by simpl i f icat ion ,
s tabi l i t y and unint e l l i gi bi l i t y . Trudg i l l ' s initial hypothe s i s is that
Arvan i t ika will display reduction but no t the othe r three . He says ( 1 9 7 7 : 35 )
that Arvan i t ika :
is uns table in that it is in a state of considerable flux ,
with no real norms f o r usage
[ and )
i t remains to a
certain extent mutually inte l l igible wi�h Albanian .
• • •• • •Howeve r , he has shown that , al though the re are some clear examp l es of
reduction ( the loss of re l a t i onal words and the loss of the impe rfec t ) , other
changes involve simp l i f i cation in one component of the language with
compensa t i on elsewhe re (which he cal l s ' si mp l i f i ca t ion with cost ' ) . The se are
cases of the replacement o f synthe t i c forms by analyt i c forms . There are a l so
cases of overall simp l i f i cation viz . cases of the loss of syntagmatic
redundancy , such as the loss of the definite connect ing part i c le s . Howeve r , he
notes ( 1 9 7 7 : 4 7 ) tha t :
there are no examples of the los s of paradigma t i c
In Arvani t ika the three
redundancy commonplace in pidgins .
genders remain d i s t inct , 43 as do the separate declens ions
and conj uga t i ons .
Irregular verbs and plural forma t i ons
also remain ir regular .
I am not convinced that all the changes which Trudgi l l d i s cusses are due
to language 'death ' . As Dorian pointed out , the types of changes she found are
s imi l a r to those in 'healthy ' languages . Trudg i l l compares present-day
Arvan i t ika with modern Albanian .
It seems tha t Arvanit ika is spoken by
des cendent s of Albanians who immigrated to Greece mainly in the 1 1 th and 1 5 th
centuri e s . Many of the changes Trudg i l l di scusses could have occurred as
It
normal language changes throughout a long period of s table b i l ingua l i s m .
seems that a more rapid shi f t i s taking place now as olde r speaker s tend to use
Arvan i t ika for mos t purposes , while as Trudgi l l says ( 1 9 7 7 : 38 ) :
middle-aged speake rs and younger adul t s indulge in a
cons ide rable amount of switching accord ing to factors such
as formality , locati on , subj ect-ma t te r , the pre sence of
outsiders and the lingu i s t i c abi l ity of interlocutors .
He may have obtained d i f f e rent resu l t s if he had compared the speech of
younger people wi th that of older ones , as Dori an did .
( 6 ) Aus t i n ( 1 98 1 ) describes briefly the changes in three Eas t e rn Aus t ralian
language s . In two of these , Gami laraay and Dharawa l , the re are no l onger
f luent speakers , knowledge of the language con s i s t ing of some word s and a few347
set expre s s i ons or sentences .
In Gamilaraay basi c a l l y only certain fixed forms
of words are remembered and as it ' i s presently spoken has no syntac t i c
features which diffe rentiate it f rom Engl i s h ' ( ib id : 25 ) . Ngiyambaa i s more
actively controlled with a small speech communi tv rangin� from fluent speakers
to those who know only some word s . 4 4 In the Ngiyambaa of younger speakers , some
case inf lect ions and inf lected ve rbs are retained , though the re is a collaps ing
and reanalys i s of some case suffixe s and ve rb conj uga t ions . A phonological
change common to Gamilaraay and Ngiyambaa i s the loss of distinction be tween
the two rho t i c s r and rr , inf luenced by Engl ish .
In Gami laraay the re i s a
re tention of the lamino-dental stop , which is also noted in other languages .
One syntac t i c change no ted by Donaldson for Ngiyambaa ' il l u s t ra t e s replacement
of a synthe t i c , morphologically complex construct ion by a simpler anal ytical
one ' (Aus t in 1980 : 26 ) . 45
( 7 ) In summari s ing the changes in language death Dre s s le r and Wodak-Leodol t e r
( 1 9 7 7 : 8 7 ) say :
Language death the ref ore can be looked at as a sort of
pidgini sat ion : obligatory rules change to variable one s ;
the polys t y l i sm o f a normal language moves t o monostylism.
Howeve r , Dorian ( 1 9 7 8a : 60 6 ) has found tha t the changes in ESG are rio t
ind i cative of pidgini s a t i o n .
Radical morphological simp l i f i cat ion as found in many
pidgins i s not charac t e r i s t i c of E S G , even among the mos t
hal ting speakers , even ve ry ne ar the point of extincti o n .
From mos t o f the se s tudi e s o n l anguage death i t seems , as Dorian
( 1 98 1 a : 1 5 1 ) concluded , that there is basically no d i f fe rence be tween the types
of change in 'dying ' languages and those found in 'healthy ' language s . The
d i f f e rence is probably more in the amount of change ( in a relat ively short time
span ) . 468.2.3.2CllABGES III TIWI III llELATIOH TO LANGUAGE DumSome of the changes in Tiwi can be seen to be simi lar to those desc ribed
for various language death si tua tions and , as already menti oned , are therefore
no d i f f e rent f rom normal language change ( see Chap ter 7 for a summary of the
change s ) .
( 1 ) Phono logical change s
As in Ngiyambaa and Gamilaraay ( Austin 1 98 1 ) , the d i s t inction be tween the
two rho t i c s of TT appears to be col lapsing , due to the infl uence of Eng l i sh
( see 2 . 3 . 8 , p . 43 ) . A similar phenomenon is found in the fal l ing toge the r of
the post- and apico-alveolar consonants ( see 2 . 3 . 1 , p . 34 ) . The se changes could
be due to lexical fading , whe re words containing the less common ( but more
marke d ) consonants , the post-alveolar one s , are gradually being l o s t f rom the
language , so that the d i s t inct ion be tween the two types is blurred and
eventually l o s t ( cf . point ( ii ) of Dre s s le r ' s conclus i ons given on p . 34 5 of3488 . 2 . 3 . 1 ) . These changes can be regarded as cases of ove rall simp l i f ication .
In TT , there are very few minimal pairs ( if any ) with post- and api co-alveolar
consonants in contrast and so there i s very l i t t le loss of seman t i c
d i s tinction .
As Dre s s s le r found in dying Bre ton , the re is much variation in the
phone t i c s and phono logy , influenced by the sound system of the dominant
language ( point ( i i i ) on p . 34 5 ) .
Although I know of no opt ional rules in TT whi ch have been lost in MT ( cf .
point ( i ) on p . 34 5 ) , a phonemic alternation , between non-nasali sed and
prenasal ised stops , in TT has been lost in MT . The prenasalisation has been
dropped comp l e t e ly by some young speake rs and is used optionally in some words
by othe r s ( see 2 . 3 . 3 , p . 37 ) .
S ince dif fe rent TT speech s tyles have not been s tudied , particularly
before extensive contact with Engl ish , i t cannot be determined whe ther the re
has been much ' s tyli s t i c shrinkage ' ( see point ( iv ) , p . 345 ) . 4 7 Even i f the re
has been some ' s t yl i s t i c shrinkage ' there has also been ' s tyl i s t i c expans i on ' ,
in which a LTT style has become a very formal style for some young people , with
a l e s s formal s tyle being MT (with inflected auxi l iarie s ) and an even l e s s
f ormal s t y l e being casual MT (with n o inf lec ted auxi liarie s ) ( see Table 8 . 1 ,
p . 330) .
In the i r more formal styles MT speake rs tend to use phonological
variat ions whi ch are closer to the TT phonology , such as the use of an ini tial
/ 8/ on p ronouns .
I t would seem then tha t the Tiwi s i tua tion does not exactly para l l e l that
o f cases o f dying languages as far as the phonologi cal changes are conce rned .
( 2 ) Lexicon
In MT , as in Tlaxclan Nahuat l and Arvani t ika , there i s considerable
relexi f i c a t ion , through the use of English loans ( see 7 . 2 . 1 , p . 3 1 7 ) . Trudg i l l
( 1 9 7 7 : 39 ) que s t ions whe ther the l o s s of Albanian words in Arvanit ika i s a case
of reduc tion s ince the Arvani tika speake rs know and use Greek loan e quivalents
in the i r Arvan i t ika . Thi s applies in the MT si tuation to a certain extent with
re spect to Eng l i sh loans . Howeve r , there i s clearly reduct i on as many of the
TT words l o s t have no equivalent in MT , such as the names of d i f f e rent species
o f bush honey ( see 3 . 2 . 3 , p . 9 1 , and Appendix 1 » . On the o ther hand , the
lexicon is expanded as word s are borrowed for new items and concepts ; such as
purrupuli ' f ootbal l ' . In TT the term i s yilogha which has been extended to
cover thi s from the trad i ti onal meaning of ' bladde r ' .
The reduc ti on and expansion in the lexicon can be seen to be due to the
need to mee t the demands of a changing cul ture and is the same type of change
which occurs in normal language change when the culture is also changing
( though pe rhaps more s lowly ) .
The vas t reduction of the class of verb s tems and the corresponding
expansion o f the class o f f ree form ve rbs could be seen as relexi f i c a t i on .
Howeve r , the process involves more than that and i s part o f the gene ral change
f rom the use of synthe t i c to analyt i c forms ( see ( 5 ) below) .","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356]"

forming more complex sentences .
There are a numbe r o f cases o f subordinate
clause s in TT expres sing d i f ferent re lationships . The subordina t ing s t rategy
used in Tiwi i s that of a subordinat ing conj unc t ion and a clause with a f ini te
ve rb . Glass has found tha t this seems to be the mos t common s t rategy in
Aus t ral ian prefixing languages (Glass 1 980 : 8 ) . The bas i c subordinate
conj unc t i ons i n TT are karri 'when' , expre s s ing a temporal relationship ( 6 . 9 . 3 ,
p . 29 9 ) , pili 'be caus e ' express ing reason ( 6 . 9 . 5 , p . 30 l ) , pili ngini ' in order
to ' , expre s s ing purpose ( 6 . 9 . 6 , p . 30 2 ) and ngini which i s a general subordinate
conj unct ion and complemen t i s e r ( COMPR) ( see 6 . 9 . 7 , p . 304 ) . As wel l as the se ,
the re l a t ive pronouns ( 3 . 3 . 3 , p . 1 1 3 ) and prepo s i t ions ( d is cussed in 5 . 2 , p . 2 3 5 )
may b e used a s subordinate conj unct ions ( see 6 . 9 . 1 ; 6 . 9 . 3 , p . 299 and 6 . 9 . 4 ,
p . 3 00 ) .
Some of the claus es d i s cussed below could be called 'adj o ined relat ive
clause s ' ( pa r t i cularly those with the complementiser ngini ) s ince the i r surface
pos i t i ons with respe c t to the main clause s are marginal rather than embedded
( Ha l e 1 9 7 6 : 7 8 ) . Howeve r , othe r s , such as the re l a t ive clauses (which do have
d i s tinct relat ive pronouns , see 6 . 9 . 1 . 1 ) are embedded within other clause s and
so are d e f ini t e l y subordina t e . Al s o , s ince none of the c lauses d iscus sed be low

( 2 ) Concomi tative .moneyThe concomitat ive (Con ) is the nominal argument of the verb whi ch is

d i s cussed at some length in 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 3 ) ( p . 1 6 5 ) b u t some of the discus s i on i s
r e i terated he re . Thi s prefix , ma - , may immediately pre cede a form, ji (ngi ) - ,
which means ' in , on ' and in this case the concomi tative normally has the role
of conveyance o r vehic le , though in some cases it seems that what i s refe rred
to by the concomi tative i s actually 'in' o r 'on' the person re f e r red to by the
subj ec t , as in example 6-9 ( d ) . When the prefix ma(rri ) - occurs without the
form ji (ngi ) - the role of the concomi tative is normally accompaniment , though
the range incl uded in TT is wider than in English , including things whi ch are
carrie d , as in example 6-9 ( a ) . The concomi tative could perhaps be divided into
two diffe rent grammatical relat ions , vehi cle and accompaniment , but at this
s t age they are t reated together because i t i s s t i l l not clear without further
inve s t i ga ti on whe ther this is the ba s i c d i s t inction . There are other uses of

the concomi tat ive marker which need further inve s t igation.
concomi tat ive refers to an obj ect o r pe rson in close associa t i on with one of
the o the r maj o r nominal arguments of the clause , normally S o r DO .
The concomita tive may be manif e s ted ove r t l y by a NP or pronominal

In some
cases there is no ove r t refe rence to the concomi tat ive and the meaning has to
be inf e r red f rom the context as in example 6-9 ( e ) or from one ' s knowledge of

In MT , mos t of the non-core argument s and also the 10 are expre ssed in the

"6.2. 1 . 1COKE ARGUMENTS IR TT( 1 ) Subj e c t . The subj ect ( S ) is the nominal argument whi ch is requi red in the
int rans i t ive clause . Dixon ( 1 980 : 2 8 6 ) labels the two nominal a rguments
requi red in the transit ive clause A and 0 , whe re A is the trans i t ive subj ect
and 0 i s the trans i t ive obj ect . 4 In TT , S and A fall togethe r and are denoted
by S . Ne i ther have case-marking and they cannot be d i s t inguished by word order
d i f f e rences ( see 6 . 8 , p . 29 1 ) . Moreove r , they are normally encoded on the verb
by the same set o f prefixes ( see 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 , p . 1 7 2 ) . Thi s i s another feature in
which Tiwi differs f rom mos t Aus tral ian language s , particularly Pama-Nyungan
languages ( Dixon 1 980 : 28 6 ) . The term S refers to the nominal a rgument required
in a l l verbal clauses and which i s encoded in the ve rb by the f i rs t and se cond
pref ixes ( see Table 4 . 3 , p . 1 5 2 ) . Thi s app l i e s to those clauses whi ch require
j us t one nominal a rugment ( v i z . act ive int rans i t ive clauses and s t a t ive verbal
ac t i ve
clauses ) and those whi ch require two or three nominal arguments ( vi z .

claus e s which identi f i e s who or what i s being talked about . The t e rm S is used
be cause o f the relat ionship be tween s t a t ive non-ve rbal clauses and s tative
ve rbal clause s .
In the l a t t e r case the same verbal subj e c t pref ixes are used
as in act ive clauses (see 6 . 4 . 1 , p . 2 83 , and also 6 . 5 . 1 , p . 28 5 ) . The re seems no
reason to call this nominal argument by another term.
In the non-verbal clauses the subj e c t may be manif e s ted by an expanded NP ,
but i t is more usual for i t t o be man i f e s t ed by a single word , such as a noun ,
pronoun , definit ive or . demonstrative , with a qual i ty or s tate e t c . being given

The 1 0 i s the nominal argument to whi ch the 10 pref i xes on the ve rb re f e r
( 4 . 2 . 3 , p . 1 7 9 ) . 5 Although ' indirect obj e c t ' i s used here , the sense s in which
it is used in TT are much wider than those normally covered by the term. The
10 may encode bene fact ive (as in example 6-5 ( a » , purpose (as in example
6-5 ( b » , the addressee with certain verbs of speech ( 6- 5 ( c » , the patient

The 10 in TT appears to cover a similar range of funct ions as both the

The 1 0 prefix i s often the only ind i cat ion of the presence of an 1 0 in the

and /or a n incorporated form i n the nucleus o f the verb ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 2 ) , p . 1 60 ) .
Al though bene fac tive and purpose are not normally arguments of the ve rb
( cf . Dixon 1 9 80 : 29 7 f ) , they are cons idered as such in TT , since , when they are
present in a clause they are cross-referenced to the ve rb , with the 10 prefix
ind i cat ing person and number ( and , in the case of third s ingular pe rson ,
gende r , see Table 4 . 8 , p . 1 80 ) . Here 'benefactive ' and ' purpos e ' are semantic
