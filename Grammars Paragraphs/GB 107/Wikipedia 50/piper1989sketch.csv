"5.5.1 Interrogatives.
There are two types of interrogatives in the language. One type for polar
questions and another type for non-polar questions.
Polar questions have the same form as declaratives but with rising
intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question:
(S.64) ma- y
kari-m paret dirup- o?
2SgA-Deix lSg- All dirt sweep-Fut2/3
'Will you sweep for me?'
(S.65) ma suga
dikri- o?
2SgA <EngO throw-Fut2/3
'Have you put in sugar?
Non-polar questions require an interrogative pronoun or clitic inserted at
the beginning of the utterance. The form of the interrogative depends on what is
being questioned (see the section on Interrogative Pronouns, p72). Although
these typically occur at the beginning, they can follow a pronoun:
(S.66) ma nalu ike-li?
2SgA whatO do- Prlmpf
'What are you doing?'
192The attention getting particle aka 'hey!' is often inserted at the beginning
of an utterance such as a question to attract the addressee's attention:
(5.67) (aka) ma- y
idimge bakyamu- 0
awgog- em?
hey 2SgS-Deix morning-Loe Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 big climb-All
'(Hey,) are you going up to the top of the hill tomorrow?
(5.68) aka ka ge- ka ut
na- ydilu
able uteb- ge?
hey lSgS Deix-lSgS sleep Futl-n PIS lie down-FutlSg Det place-Loe
'Hey, will I sleep here at this place?
There is a particle -aw which is cliticised onto the last word in the sentence.
It operates like a tag question asking for confirmation or just checking to see
whether the speaker has the addressee's attention:
(5.69) ma kcira mir asor- 0aw?
2SgA lSgGen word listen-Fut2/3-tag
'You will listen to what I am saying, won't you?'
(5.70) e
no teb+teb
baka-aw?
3SgS Restr alone Adj go- tag
'He went on his own, didn't he?'
There is also a vocative suffix -oy affixed to a proper noun when the person
being addressed is distant or non-visible. When the person is close-by, no marker
is used:
(5.71) Kosir-oy 'hey Kosir!'
Warib-oy 'hey W arib!'
Eydyana-oy 'hey Eidiana!'
?Pomoy-oy 'hey Pomoy!'
Examples need to be collected to see whether this suffix can be used when
kinship terms or common nouns are used for address forms:
?ama-oy
'hey mother!'
?berbet-oy 'hey sibling!'
?nap-oy
'hey grandchild!'
?kerim le-oy 'hey boss!'
It can also be used with interrogative pronouns where the forms will differ
depending on whether what is being questioned is animate (-oy) or inanimate
(-ay): e.g. nete-oy 'who?'; nalu(w)-ay 'what?'
l
i.I'5.5.2 Imperatives.
As we saw earlier in the section on temporal/ aspectual morphology, there
is no distinction between the future and the imperative for 2nd person. The
same form of the verb is used for both functions. However, the pronoun can be
omitted when it is being used with an imperative function:193(5.72)wapum+wapum ero-0
slow Intens?
eat-Fut2/3
'Eat slowly.'
(5.73) able
erw-am
Det N? eat- Fut2/3Dual
'Eat this (you two).'
When it is a negative imperative, the verb can be used in its nominal form
with the privative suffix:
(5.74) nole ero-0
nole aro- kak
Neg eat-Fut2/3
Neg eatN-Priv
'Don't eat it.'
Note, however, that the privative nominal is actually ambiguous for the
utterance could be interpreted as '(It's) inedible' although there is a different
intonation for each.
5.5.3 Reported Speech.
No examples of indirect speech have been collected in the data despite the
fact that there are some 150 pages of texts. The most common strategy is to report
speech directly. A complement kega can optionally be used to introduce the
speech act. It may be related to the following deictic markers: ke(y) 'in this
manner, way' + ga 'and then, and also there':

asked her: ""Hey, what are you?"" Dew said to him: ""!am a person."" Dew
asked him in tum: ""Are you a person (or) are you a ghost?"" Irwam said
to her: ""! am a person.""'
5.6Negation.
The negation particle nole - ne (these are in free variation) 'not, no' must
precede the verb and typically occurs following the first accented element in the
utterance to negate an event:
(5.77) wi
kikem-ge
3n SgS first- Loe
le
nole umer-kak da-r(a)a
Neg know-Priv I -3n SgS-1 n PIS be(person)-PrlmpfPauc
'They did not know at first.' (Dewmer, p213, section28)
(5.78) e
ne tabra mamorser tabra bud itkiri op- ge
3SgA Neg 3Gen properly 3Gen mudO wipe off-Pf face-Loe
'She did not properly wipe off the mud on her face.'
(5.79) ma nole abi dip0
2SgA Neg 3Sg0 dob in- Fut2/3
'Don't dob him in.'
The negation particle can sometimes occur at the beginning of a clause
which is intonationally dependent on the preceding clause:
(5.80) wi
sikak we- ge akarik-ley,
3n SgS okay beach-Loe land- PastDual
nole lelut yabi
nardar-i
Neg person-SgA 3n SgO 3n SgO-see- Pf
'They (2) landed on the beach, allright, no-one saw them.'
(Dewmer, p209, section7)
5.7Valency Changes.
In the section on the intransitiviser ba-, the prefix was shown to make
transitive verbs intransitive either by making the A the S argument as it is
reflexive, or by making the 0 the S argument of the intransitivised verb. This
process is exploited in the language for a number of So/listic effects.
The intransitiviser can be used with events affecting inalienable body parts
where the Sis reflexive and the non-S argument, if there is one, is either
interpreted as a non-syntactic argument or as part of the verb phrase:195(5.81)·,
Iimus ba- tu- Ii
lSgS beard Intr-shave-Primpf
'I am shaving myself.' (lit: I am beard-shaving)
(5.82) Gamalay ba- trimurik-li
G.S
lntr-stretch- Primpf
'Gamalay is stretching.'
Contrast 5.81 with 5.83 and 5.82 with 5.84:
(5.83) Lez-ide tabara imus itw- i
L.- A 3Gen beardO shave-Pf
'Les shaved his beard.'
(5.84) ka netat teter erapeyda, ka netat teter itrimurik-da
lSgA one footO break Sg/DualO-PfSg lSgA one footO stretch- PfSg
'I have one leg folded, I have one leg stretched out.'
A much larger corpus of data is required to establish what the meaning
difference is between using the transitive and the intransitive forms. To date,
only events involving body parts have been collected with this kind of case frame
and one could hypothesize that there is a preference for these types to be treated
in this way because an intransitivised verb allows the 0 to be expressed within
the verb phrase, making it parallel in form and function to reflexive
constructions.
There is an innovation in the use of the intransitiviser bai which is
sometimes being used for events that are not necessarily reflexive, but rather
because the same pronominal free form is used. As was seen earlier, the same
pronominal forms can be used for the reflexive, i.e. oneself, as well as the
exclusive meaning, i.e. by oneself:
(5.85) ka imus itw- i kababu
lSgA beardO shave-Pf Exel
'I shaved my beard by myself.'
(5.86) ka kababu imus ba- twi
lSgS lSgRefl beard Intr-shave-Pf
'I shaved myself.'
However, speakers are sometimes making the verb intransitive when it is
the intensive pronominal function:
(5.87) ma
mabu
ba- smer-0
2SgA/S Refl/Excl lntr-see- Fut2/3
'See yourself - See for yourself.'
Thus, the presence of the intransitiviser morpheme doe.6 not,in such
instances) , indicate a reflexive action.It is the result of the pronominal free
form, marking a reflexive action (i.e. 5=0) and/or an exclusive meaning (i.e.
nonsyntactic).
ka1965.8Periphrastic Constructions.
Inchoative and causative events are typically expressed periphrastically.
Causative constructions have two verbs: the causing event and the resulting
change of state. Inchoative constructions also have two verbs: an intransitive
activity type verb and the resulting change of state. Let us examine each type in
turn.
The verbs ikay 'make Sg/DualO' and iker 'make Pauc/PlO' express the
causal part of the event with the A acting upon the 0, and the inchoative verb
expresses the result with the 0 of 'cause' usually the S of 'become' (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.88) wi
nakerda
3n SgA 3n SgO-make Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
tewpay mir berda
short word pauc/ plS become-perfpl
'They have made the words become short.'
(5.89) kaba- yde abi ikayda ekesmu- da

'The banana (tree) has made it (the pipe) split.'
(5.90) Lez-ide bakir ikayda lawlaw bayda
L.- A stoneO make Sg/DualO-PfSg tableS Sg/DualS become-PfSg
'Les made a table out of a stone/ Les made the stone into a table.'
Causal verbs can occur outside causative constructions meaning 'tell' (with
'word' incorporated into the verb complex) and 'swive' (with the paucal/plural
form of the verb being used which could be an idiomatic use)':
(5.91) kimyaride taba koskir
mir ikay-da
married man-A 3Gen married femaleO word tell- PfSg
aw mir+mir koskir

'The husband told his wife. She is a big talker.'
(5.92) ka mad naker- e
1SgA 2Sg0 Fut1+1/2Sg0-swive-Fut1
'I will swi ve you.'
With inchoative events, there is a clear preference to express it as a
complex event involving an intransitive activity type verb with an S argument
(akay 'Sg/DualS do' and eker 'do') and the inchoative verb (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.93) e
akayda kimyar bayda
3SgS Sg/DualS do-PfSg man
Sg/DualS become-PfSg
'He has become a man.'
...Je kimyar bay-da197(5.94)ege epigeme-lu

Sg/DualS do-PastSg stoneS/0/0? Sg/DualS become-PastSg
'She then changed, turned into a stone.' (D6pem, p218, section25)
(5.95) ese gur w- akay0

sea-Intens-All Fut3-Sg/DualS become-Fut2/3
maykeaw wag
close big wind
'If the sea turns a deep sea colour (i.e. murky), a big wind (is) nearby.'
Although little can be said about the precise meaning of the intransitive
verbs 'do', it can be pointed out that these verbs are used to mark the inception of
a process and that they always are intransitive with an S argument and the
second nominal, if there is one, being either a non-syntactic argument or part of
the complex verb phrase:
(5.96) ma nole sirib- ge akay0
2SgS Neg shame-Loe Sg/DualS be-Fut2/3
'Do not start to become ashamed.'
(5.97) e
ni
aryem eke-Ii
3SgS water drinkN-All do- Prlmpf
'He is just about to drink.'
(i.e. the glass is pressed against his lips and he is about to drink.)
(5.98) able kimyar
pe able newr
somay-ge eke-Ii
Det married manS Deix Det unmarried female lust- Loe do- Prlmpf
'That man there has started lusting after that girl.'
(Note that the role of the non-S nominal is not understood although it may be
literally: ?That man is doing that girl lust.)
The forms of the inchoative verbs warrant some discussion as well. Note
the resemblance between these forms, i.e. bay, ber, and the causative and
intransitive 'do' forms, i.e. ikay, iker, and, akay, aker. It may be that the forms are
derived from the transitive verb with the intransitiviser ba- although the
transformation also involves an odd change, namely the loss of the initial vowel
and consonant.
5.9Clause Relators.
We saw in the section on deictic markers that these sometimes fulfill a
function parallel to that fulfilled by subordinate (relative) clause markers in other
languages. One of the main differences is the lack of syntactic dependency
between the two clauses although there is often intonational dependency198between the two. In addition, there are several clause relaters which overtly
signal a semantically subordinate relationship between the clause in which they
occur and the main clause. The verb in the subordinate clause, however, has full
inflectional markings, i.e. it is finite. Here are some of the relaters and an
example of each:
temporal clause relaters:

'Flatten it so that it becomes really flat.'
Some of the clause relators have other functions which do not mark a
dependent clause. For example, kewbu can either serve to introduce a temporal
dependent clause meaning 'after' or it can be used as an adverb meaning 'later,
behind':
(5.112) ka na- ba kewbu
lSgS Futl-go later
'I will go later /behind.'
Clause relators can be distinguished from their other functions because
they always occur at the beginning of the clause (except when there is a pronoun
which can precede it).
There is also a co-ordinating conjunction a 'and, or' which can link two
words, phrases or clauses together. This may be a borrowing from English 'and':

A number of the clause relators can combine with each other providing
there is no conflict in meaning. A full description of the relators syntactic and
functional role within the clause or sentence awaits further study.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"
"Language Oassification and Type.
Unlike its neighbour Kala Lagaw Ya, which is classified as an Australian
Paman language, Meryam Mir is classified by Wurm (Ibid) as a Papuan language
of the Trans-Fly stock with a close genetic relationship to the languages of the
Eastern Trans-Fly Family, Bine, Gidra and Gizra.
Its phonology is relatively simple, comprising a three way distinction in
point of articulation for oral voiced and voiceless stops (bilabial, alveolar and
velar) and a two way distinction in point of articulation for nasal stops and glides
1(bilabial and alveolar). The remaining consonants, a voiced and voiceless
fricative, a lateral and a rhotic tap, are all produced at the alveolar point of
articulation. The language has a five vowel system contrasting front and back
vowels /i, e/ and /u, o/ with a low central vowel /a/. The pitch-accent is
phonemically significant in the language, serving to distinguish certain lexical
items. Every word bears a high pitch on either the first or second syllable with
the majority of words carrying high pitch on the second syllable. The phonology
is covered in Chapter 1.
The following word classes can be distinguished: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, deictics and interjections. Nouns and pronouns are
inflected for syntactic and non-syntactic cases. The cases are: ergative,
nominative, accusative, instrumental, allative (which includes some of the
functions of dative in other languages), ablative, locative, associative (which
could be labelled alternatively 'comitative') and genitive. There is a split case
marking system with an ergative case pattern on nouns for subjects of transitive
verbs and a nominative case pattern on pronouns for subjects of transitive or
intransitive verbs. Within the noun category, a distinction can be drawn between
common and proper nouns. With proper nouns, there is a three way split in the
case marking system with distinct inflections for the subject of a transitive verb,
the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Adjectives
as well as possessors marked by the genitive immediately precede the noun
which they modify and are thus syntactically dependent on the noun which is the
head.
Pronouns distinguish between first, second and third person with a further
distinction contrasting inclusion and exclusion for first person nonsingular. In
addition, there are distinct forms for the singular versus non-singular. There is
no gender distinction with third person. Word classes and nominals are covered
in Chapter 2.
Verbs can be categorised into two classes: atelic stative and telic active.
These classes are morphologically determined since the atelic stative verbs only
include intransitive verbs which mark the subject by means of a prefix, whereas
the telic active verbs mark either the transitive or intransitive subject
predominantly by means of a suffix. The two verb classes are partially
semantically motivated as suggested by the names atelic stative and telic active.
Verbal cross-reference markers encode information about both number,
distinguishing singular, dual, paucal and plural, and to some degree, person.
Time is divided up along the lines of present versus non-present where
present refers to events that occurred any time on the same day as the utterance
and non-present for events that occurred on another day or will occur following
the utterance. There are also aspectual features such as the imperfective and the
perfective. In addition, there is a mood marker, the irrealis non-committal,2which conveys the lack of commitment on behalf of the speaker to say whether
something will happen or not. Temporal, aspectual and mood categories, crossreference markers and other features of the verbal morphology are covered in
Chapter 3. Included in this chapter is a brief survey of adverbs, their formation
and function.
There is a rich and complex system of deixis in the language which is
explored in Chapter 4. Deictic markers' forms are determined by the temporal
occurrence of the event relative to the time of the utterance. Their function is to
essentially focus on various elements in space, time and in discourse itself.
Existential/locational verbs, intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
form the basis of simple clauses. However, there are many events or states which
are expressed by complex verbal phrases consisting of a noun and verb with
nominals forming an essential part of the verbal's meaning. In such instances,
the whole verb phrase must be regarded as a complex head. There are no valency
changing operations except for an intransitiviser morpheme. A verb's valency is
more or less fixed with some non-productive morphemes affecting the verb's
transitivity and with periphrastic constructions for expressing inchoative and
causative meanings. Basic sentence types, verbal and nominal phrases as well as
some complex sentences are briefly examined in Chapter 5.
The following study is a sketch grammar of Meryam Mir with special
attention to verbal morphology and the system of deixis.","[12, 13, 14]"
"49(from the tape made for Social Security)
The suffix can also be used with nominalised verbs in a negative
imperative:
(2.114) ma nole aro- kak
2SgA Neg eatN-Priv
'Do not eat (it).'
(The above use needs to be tested with nonsingular (pro)nouns to see whether it
is still possible without the usual cross-referencing for number on the verb.)
Morphemes beginning with a voiceless velar stop such as the privative
suffix -kak or the intensifier suffix -kar (see section 4 below p52) devoice the final
consonant of the root if it is a voiced stop:
/b/>p/-+k/d/>t/g/>kkap-kar 'original M.I. dance'
(>kab 'dance' + kar 'intensifier')
tebut-kak 'without friend'
(>tebud 'friend' + kak 'privative')
la(k)-kak 'dislike, not want'
(>lag 'desire, want' + kak 'privative')3)
The semblative suffix -ise is affixed to a (pro)nominal which is the object of
comparison. There are no examples of this affix followed by a case inflection:
eper-da ebur-ise
(2.115) e
3SgS fly- PfSg bird- Smbl
'He flew like a bird.'

(2.116) Gilam -ide ab+ab- ise dikepwar-er
G.A formerN-Smbl thinkn Primpf spirit (married) femaleO
'Gilam thought as he had the last time that (she) was a ghost.'
The suffix -ise is frequently preceded by an affix -ka whose meaning is not
clear. Examples of its use are:
(2.117) ma pe siga
iri- Ii
kari-ka-yse
2SgA Deix ciggieO drink-Primpf lsg- ?- Smbl
'You smoke cigarettes as I do.'
lu+lu wi- ge iker- iyey
(2.118) naQword-thingO 3n Sg-Deix-make-PfDual
abka-yse mokakalam Erub-ge
former-?- Smbl like/as
E.- Loe
'They (2) did the same thing as what they had done at Erub.'
umer- kak wa- ykay Kosir-ika-yse
(2.119) nerut le
another persons knowN-Priv Fut3-make K.gen?-?- Smbl
'No-one knows how to make it (cocnnuted rice) like one's Kosir.'
(Note that in the above sentence, the privative phrase is functioning like a
predicate.)50It may be that the semblative suffixes -kayse and -ise do not signal anymeaningful difference but are simply in free alternation. Alternatively, it may beO,
mor.photogical distinction where common nouns take the form -ise and other
nominals (pronouns and proper nouns) take the form -kayse.
The suffix -kayse is also used with adjectives with a comparative effect:
(2.120) able wag kikem kelar- kak wam-i
Det windS first
strength-Priv blow-Pf
a
no abra
kelar
aw-ka-yse batay-0
Conj Restr 3SgGen strengths big-?- Smbl grow-Pf
'At first, the wind blew without strength (but then), its strength just
grew bigger (or big-like?).'
The related suffix -ka, which is often reduplicated on adjectives, occurs as a't\i
intensifier to indicate a greater or lesser degree:
(2.121) e
aw le
daIi
3SgS big person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a big/old man.'
(2.122) e
aw-ka+ka le
daIi
3SgS big- Intens person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a very big/old person.'
In 2.122, -ka(ka) is functioning as an adjectival intensifier. There is a
similar derivation -kar which is added to nouns as an intensifier with the
meaning 'the real N, the even more like N':
(2.123) keymerkar
young sibling-Intens
'the youngest sibling'
(2.124) ukar
pe daIi
coconut-Intens Deix n PIS be(person?)-Prlmpf
'Those are the proper kind of palm trees.'
The suffix -ka occurring on adjectives and the suffix -kar occurring on
nouns could be related and these in turn are probably related to the semblative
construction with -kayse.
There are comparative constructions with the ablative case used to mark a
standard comparison (2.125 and 2.126) and the allative case used to mark the
property with respect to which a comparison is made (2.127):
(2.125) yaba
mir wi
dipigeme-daryey, akay-da yaba
mir
3n SgGen wordO 3n SgA change- PfDual do- Pfsg 3nonsggen wordS
kebi+kebi nerut tonar ikeredi Mabyog-lam
little Adv? another habit n PIS be(thing)-Pr M.Abl
'They (2) changed their language (Central Islanders') so that it became
slightly different from (that) spoken at Mabyog.'","[60, 61, 62]"
"291here are a number of existential/locational verbs whose choice is determined by
features such as animacy, shape and location of the subject.
Adjectives.
Adjectives are essentially a closed class. These include: aw 'big', kebi 'little,
young', debe 'good', adud 'bad'. Also included in this class are determiners and
quantifier words such as netat 'one', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several',
mitkar 'alot', gayr 'many'. As these items are the most representative of
adjectives cross-linguistically, it seems plausible that these are the basic adjectives
with others being derived from nouns or verbs. Words which function as
adjectives modify a noun in some way or are used attributively in a predicative
construction. Their position in the sentence is either before the noun which they
modif)j or preceding an existential verb when they are used with an ascriptive
function.
Pronouns.
Included in this class are personal, interrogative and indefinite pronouns.
Personal pronouns are a closed class of shifters. The interrogative and indefinite
pronouns differ from personal pronouns syntactically in that the former,
interrogatives and indefinites, inflect for case like nouns; the latter, personal
pronouns, inflect for case by opposing A/S to 0, i.e. on a nominative-accusative
pattern.
Adverbs.
Words in this class serve to modify the verb in some way either in
manner, e.g. dudum+dudum ""quickly"", or in time, e.g. mena 'continue, remain,
still', etc. They are a closed class of words but it is possible through derivation to
extend this class from other word classes. Adverbs do not bear any inflections
and occur in a position preceding the verb.
Deictic Markers.
This is a closed word class in which items occur as phonologically
independent units but do not constitute independent utterances by themselves.
Their forms are determined by the time of the event relative to the time of the
speech act utterance. Aspects of their meaning involve place, e.g. here/there;
time, e.g. now I then; referent, e.g. this one, that one; logical relations, e.g. but,
instead, what has been said, what is about to be said.
Clause Relators.
Items in this closed class serve to link two syntactic elements together.
These might be two phrases or two clauses (and in the case of the conjunction a,30this can also be two words). Little can be said about relators without a full study
of the types of clause linkage. There will be no discussion about them and they
are simply listed with an example of each in the chapter on basic syntax. Note
that deictic markers are also used in this category or rather exploited in this
category to link two syntactic units together.
Exclamations/Interjections.
Within this class of words are items which have no syntactic value and
which can occur as a complete utterance. Examples include waw 'yes', nole 'no',
way (-wey) 'alas, poor one, dear one', megiyem 'yuk' (lit: vomit-All), mayem
'welcome', erarem 'boring' (lit: tired-All), akame-akasi 'to express surprise,
incredulity', no bes mimi 'see you later' (lit: Restr lie wander), baru 'okay'. Items
in this class need not belong exclusively to this class. Thus, an item such as menaJ
which was discussed earlier as an adverb meaning 'keep on, remaining still', may
also be used as an interjection meaning 'hang on, wait'. This class will not be
discussed further.
Noun Morphology.
Nouns_, whether functioning as syntactic or local arguments of the verb,
must be suffixed with a case inflection. The choice of inflection is determined by
the case frame of the verb and the type of nominal; that is whether it is a
common or proper noun.","[40, 41, 42]"

There is an additional pronominal set which functions both as a reflexive/
reciprocal pronoun and as an 'exclusive' pronoun. In the latter function, it
provides information about the will or high level of involvement of the Sor A,
i.e. A or S exclusively. Its meaning is captured by the following paraphrase: by
oneself, by one's own free will, on one's own. It does have a semantic restriction
in that it must be co-referent with the S or A. The forms themselves are derived
from other pronominal forms:
kababu 'myself, on my own' < ka lSgA/S
kerbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n SgExcl)' < kerbi ln SgExclO
merbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n Sglncl)' < merbi ln SglnclO
mabu 'yourself, on your own (Sg)' <ma 2SgA/S
wabu 'yourself, on your own (n Sg)' < wa 2n SgA/S
tababu 'himself, herself, themselves, on his/her/their own (non)Sg'
< taba(ra) 3Gen
Note that the dual function of this set is parallel to the English pronominal
set with 'self: which can be used for both reflexive/reciprocal events, e.g. I hit
myself, and to mark an exclusive role in the action, e.g. I did it by myself.
Some examples of the two uses follow:
(2.252) ma mara meta dimr- i mabu?
2SgA 2SgGen houseO build-Pf 2SgExcl
'Did you build your house on your own?'
(2.253) e

'He went of his own accord.'

'Help yourself (to the food)!'
(usually said at a feast to encourage people not to be shy and to serve
themselves)70(2.255) able koskiret tababu able lamar erdar-i
Det (married)female-SgA 3Excl Det spiritO see- Pf
'The woman, herself, saw the ghost.'
(i.e. it was not someone else who saw it)
The two functions are usually kept distinct because when the pronoun is
being used in a syntactic function (i.e. as a reflexive/reciprocal pronoun), the verb
has the intransitiviser prefix ba-. Thus:
(2.256) ma mabu ba- smer-o
2SgS 2SgRefl Intr-see- Fut2/3sg
'See yourself.'
(2.257) ma mabu dasmer-o
2SgA 2SgExcl seeFut2/3sg
'See for yourself.'
However, the language is in a state of flux with many speakers using the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as the only signal for reflexive/reciprocal
actions and reserving the pronoun for the exclusive meaning but with the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as well. Thus:
(2.258) werem ba- mrida
childS Intr-sit down-PfSg
'The child sat himself down.'
(2.259) werem tababu ba- mrida
childS 3Excl Intr-sit down-PfSg
'The child sat himself down on his own.'
What seems to be happening is that the presence of the pronoun is
automatically triggering the intransitive form of the verb irrespective of whether
the action is reflexive/reciprocal or not. This change is probably due to the high
frequency of the two meanings of the pronoun (i.e. as both an exclusive marker
and a reflexive/reciprocal marker).
One can speculate on the origin of this set of pronouns. Ray, in his study
(1907), gives the following set of genitive singular pronouns:
kaba-ra 1SgGen (>modern: kara)
maba-ra 2SgGen (>modern: mara)
taba-ra 3SgGen
(>modern: tabara)
These may have been the source of the roots of the pronominal set
discussed above. Note that the affix -bu that occurs suffixed to the pronouns,
e.g. kababu 'on my own', might be a particle or it might be derived from the
instrumental nominal suffix -u, e.g. bakir-u 'with a stone'. The consonant may
have been inserted because of two vowels occurring across a morpheme
boundary, e.g. kaba+u ---> kaba-b-u. (Consonant insertion is attested elsewhere
with the instrumental case, e.g. lu 'thing'---> lug-u 'with something'.) The
choice of the bilabial stop insertion could have been due to the presence of a71bilabial stop in the root (except for mabu, *mababu which was affixed to maintain
regularity within the paradigm). Thus, these free-standing pronominal forms
might be derived from the instrumental case but whose meaning is to provide
information about the clause as to the volition or the unique participation of the
A/S.
Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns.
There is a set of interrogative words used with non-polar questions such as
nete 'who', netim 'to who, for who', nade 'when, where', nalug-lam 'why, from
what', etc. Within this set are included: nade 'when, where~ which is used to
introduce a temporal or spatial adverbial clause, and nako 'what (to do)~ which is
used to introduce an activity clause. Interrogative words follow a case marking
pattern similar to nouns, an ergative-absolutive pattern, i.e. A versus S/O for
non-humans, and a three way split, i.e. A, S and 0 for humans.
The interrogative/indefinite pronominal paradigm is as follows:
nete 'who'
nalu 'what'
A
net-ide
nalug-ide
s
nalu (... nalulu)
nete
0
neti
Locative
neti-doge
nalug-e
Allative
neti-m
nalug-em
Ablative
neti-alam
nalug-lam
Genitive
neti-ra
nalug-ira
Associative
neti-pkem
Instrumental
nalug-u
Some of the interrogative words cannot be broken down into morphemes
and must be listed in the lexicon. These include:
nete 'who'
nade 'when, where'
nako 'what'
Other words are formed by the interrogative proclitic na-. For example:
na-lu 'what' (lit: Q clitic-thing)
na-ged-ge 'where' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-Loe)
na-ged-im (-nagadim) 'where to' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-All)
na-nyay+nyay 'how long (in time)' (lit: Q clitic-time N)
na-war-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-length of time-Loe)
na-kerker-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-point in time-Loe)
na-piri 'how long (in space)' (lit: Q clitic-length)
na-urut-ge 'what year' (lit: Q clitic-year-Loc)72Interrogative pronouns typically occur at the beginning of a sentence or
immediately following a sentence-initial pronoun. Examples to illustrate

Meryam Mir is a Papuan language spoken in the Torres Strait, that stretch
of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It has an A-0-V
or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology. Case inflections are
suffixed to nominals to mark their syntactic role in the clause. Markers crossreferencing the syntactic arguments of the clause are affixed to the verb indicating
number and, to some degree, person. In typological terms, the language can be
regarded as a double-marking language.
The following study is a sketch grammar of the language. Chapter 1 deals
with the phonology. Chapter 2 examines briefly the different word classes and
nominal morphology. Chapter 3 looks at verbals and their morphology. In
Chapter 4, the system of deictic markers is presented outlining some of its
functions and meanings. In Chapter 5, basic features of the syntax are outlined.","[2, 3]"
"Sociolinguistic Notes.
A special form of the language is used for grieving or expressing sympathy
for an individual. This speech style is called nas+nas rnir 'sorry talk' (lit: sad Adj
word) and only affects verbs by either changing the first vowel to /o/ or /u/ or by
inserting a bilabial glide between the initial consonant and vowel; e.g. dali 'be
Primpf' ---> dwali 'be Prlmpf in sorry talk'; digern 'walk' ---> dogern 'walk in
sorry talk' (see the section in Phonology on glides p. 10).
Whilst all Meryam speakers on Mer can talk some Creole, it is not the case
that all Creole speakers can talk Meryam. For this reason, community affairs are
generally conducted in Creole. For example, when council candidates were
giving their election speech during my stay, only one out of six candidates
delivered their speech in Meryam.
Furthermore, even with Meryam speakers, there is code-switching
depending upon the topic and addressee. In the family home, parents often
address their children in Creole, switching to Meryam when they want to discuss
something which does not concern them. However, many younger people in
their twenties and below, only have a passive knowledge of Meryam and,
consequently, always converse in Creole. It is only speakers in their mid-thirties
and above, with a sufficient grasp of Meryam, who can converse in it.
The language of education is English with Creole used informally in the
classroom for giving instructions or explaining difficult concepts. Meryam is
taught for only half an hour or an hour a week in the school and is funded by the
Commonwealth government.
The Creole spoken on Mer (and on the other Eastern Islands, see Shnukal
1988) does have a high proportion of Meryam lexical items. Similarly, speakers of
Meryam also employ Creole words although the proportion may vary
enormously from speaker to speaker and topic to topic. There are sometimes
preferences for words from a particular language and meanings can differ from
one language to another. For example, the Creole kinship terms sisi 'sister' and
bala 'brother' are used far more frequently than the Meryam term berbet 'sibling'.
An example of semantic shift is the instance of two children from one family
who use Creole terms rnarni 'mummy' and dadi 'daddy' for their parents and the
Meryam terms am.a 'mother' and bab 'father' for their grandparents instead of
the Meryam term kayed or ata for 'grandparent'.
Not all speakers of Meryam have the same command and knowledge of
the language and future research must aim at documenting the range and
differences in forms, functions and meanings comparing conservative Meryam
and Creole.",[16]

The deictic markers' status is ambiguous. Phonologically, they appear to be
independent words capable of bearing their own pitch-accent. (Pronouns either
get pre or postcliticized onto them):
(4.145) epe ta- bakyamu- da
3SgS-Deix Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
'Then he came.'
(4.146) Kosir pe tabakyamuda
'Kosir then came.'
When they are being used with spatial reference, they often carry stronger
stress marking (evidenced by higher amplitude) which thus adds emphasis:
Determining the deictic markers' position in a sentence is problematic.
There is a tendency for them to occur directly preceding the predicate or
following the first element in the clause, i.e. A/S-deictic-(0)-V, a position itself
frequently associated with clitics. Nonetheless, they frequently occur in a differeni
position although these are always predictable. They sometimes occur in clause
initial position when the A/S is omitted because its identity is already established
(see example 4.149). They sometimes occur following the verb bakyamu-/bakyaw'go'. When the deictic markers follow the verb, they always have the goal
meaning:
(4.147) e
baka ge
3SgSgo Deix
'He went there.'
Their grammatical status makes them clearly dependent as they cannot
occur without a verb:
(4.148) e
nade daIi?
pe daIi
3SgS where n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf Deix n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf
'Where is he? He is there.'*pe
*Npe
Do the deictic markers carry a phoric/ co-referential element in their
meaning and do they have a syntactic role? There are examples where the subject
and deictic marker cannot co-occur within the same clause which suggests that
the markers do indeed carry some kind of phoric/ co-referential element and do
have a syntactic function. Consider:
(4.149) ki
bakyamu- daryey pamas-em able aw lekem
1n SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual shop- All Det big person-Ass

'I went to the shops with the old man who is always growling me/ I went
to the shops with the old man; the one always growling me.'","[190, 191]"

DEICTIC MARKERS4.1.. ,IIIntroduction.
There is a closed class of markers grouped together on a semantic basis as
their meaning is dependent and relative to a place, time, referent or proposition.
They can be regarded as deictic markers because they are 'aspects of the
interpretation of sentences that relate to the speech act situation' (Fillmore, 1975;
8). In Meryam Mir, this is reflected in the choice of marker being determined by
the time at which the event or state happens or is happening relative to the time
of the speech act itself.
It is unclear whether the deictic markers are words or not. They may or may
not carry an accent. Their distribution in the sentence is equally unclear. They
always follow the first element in a sentence and they nearly always occur before
the verb in a clause. They never occur in isolation but always in conjunction
with a verb which suggests they do not have independent grammatical status. In
most examples, the deictic markers can be omitted without altering the
grammatical status although there is obviously a change in meaning. Thus, the
main functional load is on their meaning rather than their syntactic role.
Their status and grammatical function will be discussed following a
description of their forms, features and pragmatic/semantic function. However,
several points should be made before the description:
(i) Examples have been drawn mainly from texts or casual conversation as
elicitation proved to be unsuccessful though desirable for testing certain claims.
One of the consequences of such an approach is that there are major gaps in the
data and not all meanings are contrasted.
(ii) The glosses and free translations reflect the analysis of the researcher rather
than informants' translations as they rarely gave any translation for the markers
other than a spatial meaning and in some of the examples, such a translation was
clearly inadequate.
(iii) A number of features are given for each deictic marker which may prove in
the light of further research to be irrelevant in establishing the contrast between
them. Nonetheless these features have been included to make the treatment of
each marker as extensive as possible.
(iv) There is variation amongst speakers as to the appropriate or suitable marker
to be used. Some speakers actually 'correct' the form of the marker used by
another speaker, which suggests the deictic system is in a state of flux. Speakers
do have choices depending on the perspective they wish to take and particular
features which determine the choice of marker for one speaker may not be the146same prominent features which determine the choice for another speaker. In
other words, a certain amount of variation within the system may be the result of
ongoing changes.
(v) The analysis presented below is by no means final but represents a working
hypothesis based on the current corpus of data. Further study in the area may
result in considerable changes.
In the table on the next page, the deictic markers can be distinguished from
one another on the basis of temporal restrictions and domain of applicability. The
table is an attempt to capture,not function~ but differences and similarities. Note
that the gaps in the system may be because of limited data or because the temporal
reference is too distant from the present and thus distinctions are lost, i.e. there
are no markers for goal and source in the remote past and future. Below is a
summary of the deictic markers' functions..jSummary of Deictic Markers' Functions:

The present deictic markers pe and pa contrast with the non-present
markers ge and ga. Whilst the former can only be used with events or states
which coincide with the speech act utterance or precede it at a time earlier on the
same day, the latter are used with events or states which occur prior to the day or
following the utterance. To illustrate this contrast, consider the examples below.
In 4.1, reference is made to a location marked by the form ge when it is associated
with events or states that occurred a day earlier to the speech act (abgergerge
'yesterday') and by the form pe when it is associated with events that occurred
prior to the speech act (able idimge 'this morning'). Although reference is being
made to the same location, different forms must be used to demonstrate the
different time reference. Similarly, in 4.2, one group of fish caught the previous
day is contrasted with a group of fish caught earlier in the day:

'Yesterday, I climbed up to the garden (and) there I saw many bananas

(Note that the markers that concern us here are not the case inflections suffixed to
nominals which in some cases are homophonous with the deictic markers,
e.g. -ge locative inflection: abgerger-ge 'yesterday-loc'. Those that are deictic
markers are clearly labelled as such. In addition, the reader should not get
confused with verbal deictics and non-verbal deictics. These can be distinguished
from one another on the basis that verbal deictics always occur prefixed to the
verb. The deictic markers in this discussion concern the non-verbal ones.)

"112Past-NonPresent.
There are too few occurrences in the current corpus of texts to claim with
any degree of certainty what is the precise meaning of these markers. The time
reference is clearly nonpresent:
(3.120) e
bakyamu- da able gerger-ge
3SgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg Det day- Loe
'He went earlier today.'
(3.121) *e
bakyamu- lu
able gerger-ge
3SgS Sg/DualS go-PastSg Det day- Loe
'He went earlier today.'
However, its most frequent occurrence is in texts with events that
happened a long time ago:

out-All throw SgO-PastSg
'He went (and) cut off another thing (bit of wood), saw it, carved it, went
to the water and immersed it but then he just threw it, threw it away.'
There is a contrast established between the nonpresent imperfective and
the past similar to that established between the nonpresent imperfective and the
future. The nonpresent imperfective indicates that the event was repeated
whereas the past indicates that it was only a single realisation of the event, i.e.
semelfactive. Contrast the example given above (where the speaker is talking
about one particular item of wood being cut, floated and thrown away) with that
following (taken from the same story), where a number of pieces of wood are
taken, thrown into the water to see if they floated and then, thrown away:

out-All throw Pauc/PIO-n Primpf
'He went (and) carved things (bits of wood), he cut off light things, threw
them into the water (and) they then floated on the surface (so) he threw
them away.'
In addition, the past does not appear to carry any particular aspectual
meaning as when it is used at the end of a story (where it would tend to be
perfective), speakers reject it. The first example below (3.125) is an excerpt from a
text with the past form used and the second example (3.12G) is an elicited one to
see if the story could be suitably ended with it. It is dubious whether such data is
conclusive although it is suggestive:
(3.125) able neys le
akay-ley
Det two persons do- PastDual

'The two of them changed, became castaways (and) thus swam until they
reached Ne.. .' (Dewmer, p209, section8)
(3.126) ?...ewdim ba- rb- ey .
thus
Intr-punt-PastDual
'... they thus swam.'
One speaker described the distinction between the perfective and the past as
the former being more recent and the latter more distant in time to that of the
speech act:
(3.127) e
ekwey- dari ad- em digm-i
(immediate past)
3SgS stand up-PfSg out-All walk-Pf
'He stood up and walked off.'
(3.128) e
ekwey- lu
ad- em digem-0
(recent past)
3SgS stand up-PastSg out-All walk- Past
'He stood up and walked off.'
Thus it may be that the distinction between perfective and past is a
distinction between immediate and recent past. Furthermore, the fact that some
speakers do not allow the past to be used with events that happened yesterday
suggests that distant past time is a valid category. However, examples in texts
where the perfective and the past are used need to be accounted for as one would
expect either one tense or the other to be used. Alternatively, it may be that an
114association does exist between the perfective and immediate past, with speakers
preferring more recent events to be specified overtly for aspect but no such
restriction existing for more distant events. The meaning of the past-nonpresent
marker cannot be fully elucidated from the available material.
In Kalaw Lagaw Ya, there is a distinction in the verbal forms between
immediate past, recent past and remote past (Ford and Ober, 1987; 27). This could
correspond to the perfective, past and remote past categories postulated for
Meryam.
Irrealis Non-committal.
This marker is used for events where their realisation or continuation is
uncertain. It is also used sometimes by speakers to be polite, not wishing to
assume that an event, involving the addressee, definitely will (continue to)
happen. It is restricted to events with 2nd or 3rd person participants since these
are potentially less certain than events with the speaker, i.e. 1st person, which are
more certain (at least from the speaker's point of view) and cannot carry an
irrealis non-committal mood. When this mood is used, there is often an
additional component of desire on behalf of the speaker or of someone else in
wanting the event to (continue to) happen and that the event will be good.
Consider the following examples contrasting future with irrealis:
(3.129) debe le
nole inner-kak wa- yrdi
good person/ones Neg rain- Priv Fut3-n PIS be(time,place)
daw0
able kerim bakir awskir- em

'It will be good with no rain for the tombstone opening.'
(3.130) debe le
nole irmer-kak wa- yrdi
good person/ oneS Neg rain- Priv Fut3-n PIS be(time, place)
daw(w)a able kerim bakir awskir- em
n PIS be(person?)-Irr Det head stone open N- All
'I hope that it will not rain for the tombstone opening.'
(translation given by the speaker)
(3.131) ma ut nawpe
dawo
2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Fut2/3
'Remain sleeping.'
(3.132) ma ut
nawpe
daw- (w)a
2SgS sleep 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS lien PIS be-Irr
'Could you please remain asleep.'
In these examples, there is a contrast between the future (3.129 and 3.131)
and irrealis (3.130 and 3.132) with regard to the speaker's attitude. In the irrealis,
the speaker indicates his/her desire for the event to happen or continue
happening. In 3.132, the irrealis indicates the speaker's desire to be polite in not115wanting to say whether the event will happen or not although it is dear from the
context that the speaker wants the event to happen and thinks it will be good.
The irrealis examples can be tentatively explicated as follows:
I don't want to say it will happen/ go on happening
I don't want to say it won't happen/won't go on happening
I can't do it or stop it happening
(I want- you want- other people want something)
(I think- you think- other people think it will be good)
In some examples, the event is both desired by and beneficial to the
speaker:
(3.133) ese ka nole na- kyam- lu 3 klok wa- yrpeyo,
if 1SgS Neg Futl-wake up-Futl <Eng Fut3-grab Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
ma- ge kari natirwa
2SgA-Deix 1Sg01/2Sg0-wake up-Irr
'If I am not awake (when) 3 o'clock strikes, then you should wake me up.'
In some examples, the event is desired only by the speaker but beneficial to
the addressee:
(3.134) ma kari-m wit

(This example was said by an old woman to someone in their dream to
help them find the right bit of wood.)
In some examples, the event is neither beneficial nor desired by the speaker
or addressee but by another person (such as in the phrase below ese legize mari
bawru onaskawem 'if people should try and spear you' where the spearing is
desired and would benefit only the spearers, not the speaker nor addressee):

(This was said by a mother to her child urging him to dive into the water
and break the spears of those who try and spear him.)
In the following example, the event is neither beneficial nor desirable for
the speaker, only for the addressee:

'Why should you go fondling the fish?'
(where the speaker is addressing a group of women that he asked to help
him cook a fish but does not want them to know that the fish is a young
boy)In this example, the irrealis marker is used as a kind of warning. The
speaker does not want to say that the event is happening and so, he uses the
irrealis marker. This illustrates another important feature of the irrealis marker.
The irrealis is never used with yes/no questions nor non-polar interrogatives as
the presupposition in the speaker's mind is that something will happen or is
happening. Thus, below, in 3.138, the speaker assumes the addressee is staying
for a while and is asking for more information about the period of the stay. It
would be inappropriate to use the irrealis marker suggesting that the addressee
was not staying. Similarly in the other example below, 3.139, the speaker must be
thinking that there is some suggestion or possibility that the addressee will be
staying and so the irrealis marker would imply the converse:
(3.138) ma nanyay+nyay i

'Will you be staying on Murray Island?'
*aka ma i n-aw-(w)a Mer-ge?
When the irrealis marker is used with reference to 2nd person, it is
frequently used as a politeness form. Speakers often explain such sentences as the
speaker giving permission to the addressee, i.e. any time you like do it. It is
probably for this reason that the irrealis marker has been described by Ray as the
117form of the imperative used when the speaker will be absent. When it is being
used as a form of politeness, the time reference is not specified for the immediate
and hence interpretation of its meaning in terms of the speaker's absence is
plausible and accounted for. Here are some examples of its use as a politeness
form:
(3.140) ma mena naw(w)a
2SgS still 1/2Sg/PIS-n PIS be(person)-Irr
'Do stay here/ You should stay longer/ You could stay longer.'
(often used by speakers as a polite way of bidding farewell)
(3.141) ma nami

2SgA-Deix fond thoughtO Deix-send- Irr land-All
'Should you be (back) in your country, could you send (us) your good
thoughts.'
A feature of the irrealis marker which warrants further investigation is the
frequent occurrence with conditional sentences, both in the condition and the
consequent. Is the irrealis marker used to indicate a lesser degree of certainty? Is
it used to indicate an overt lack of commitment to its realisation on behalf of the
speaker? If one compares sentences with and without the irrealis, the contrast lies
in the degree of certainty of the events:
(3.143) nade ma abi erdar-0,
ma abi detager-0
when 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Fut2/3 2SgA 3Sg0 tellFut2/3
'When you see him, tell him.'
(3.144) ese ma abi erdar-0,

'If you see him, you tell him.'
(3.145) ese ma abi erdar-wa, ma abi detager-wa
if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Irr 2SgA 3Sg0 tellIrr
'If you should see him, you could tell him.'
*nade ma abi erdar-wa, ma abi detager-wa
The incompatibility of the temporal phrase marker nade 'when' and the
irrealis noncommittal suggests it does indeed carry a lesser degree of certainty. It
may also be suggesting that the speaker does not want to say whether something
will happen or not. This interpretation of the irrealis noncommittal is supported
by non-conditional sentences with 3rd person where the irrealis noncommittal
marker indicates that the speaker will not say whether something will happen or
not:118(3.146) e

'He will still sit down there and stay there and may well (still) be sitting
down there (well after the time you and me are gone or when he is a

Note that with this example, it does not seem pertinent to include whether
the speaker I addressee/ other person wants this to happen or thinks it will be
good. For this reason, the two extra components of the explication given are
optional.
Past lrrealis.
The past irrealis marker is formed by the co-occurring morphemes of the
prefix wa- and the perfective suffix. It is used for counterfactuals, i.e. to indicate
that something which could have happened, did not.

'She thought that the Warib mob would have given her some fish, they
had not given her any (because) they did not like her.'
Would one want to gloss the prefix wa- for future 3rd person the same as
for past irrealis? Such glossing would be misleading as the prefix in the future is
restricted to 3rd person, whereas it is not the case for the past irrealis:119(3.149) ka bakyamu- da abi wa- yrdar-i
lSgS Sg/DualS go-Pf 3Sg0 Pastlrr-see- PfSg
'I went to see him (but did not get to see him).'
Would one want to gloss the past irrealis as a discontinuous morpheme
involving prefix and suffix? The same conclusions reached about the future still
hold in so far as the prefix and suffix can occur independently of each other and it
is the combination of the prefix and suffix which gives it its particular meaning as
the past irrealis (although it can also be used to indicate the remote past, but see
the section below). Unlike the future use of the prefix which was restricted to 3rd
person, there are no person constraints.
Remote Past.
The remote past is used to mark events that happened a long time ago. It
represents a broad temporal category and aspectual meanings are conveyed by a
combination of the prefix wa- and various suffixes.
The remote past is marked by the prefix and the past suffix:
(3.150) abkorep e
wet- eper-e
former-type 3SgS RemPast-Deix-fly- PastSg
'Like before, she flew (to the place).' (D6pem, p217, section15)
The remote past imperfective is marked by the prefix and the present
(imperfective) suffixes:
wayke-li
(3.151) able tonar e
Det habitO 3SgA RemPast-do- Primpf
'She did (it) this way.' (D6pem, p217, section15)
yrdi(redi)
(3.152) able tonar waDet habitS RemPast-n PIS be(time, place)-Pr
'The same thing happened (there).' (D6pem, p217, section14)
The remote past perfective is marked by the prefix and the perfective suffix:
ta- bakamuda wegimu- da
(3.153) ebur waanimal RemPast-Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg RemPast-land- PfSg
wepigeme- da
RemPast-change- PfSg

foodO RemPast-Deix-carry pauc/ plO-Pf
'The bird came, landed, changed; (as) a woman, (she) went there and took
all the food.' (D6pem, p217, section15)
There is no past irrealis in the remote past or rather there is no distinction
between the remote past perfective and the past irrealis. Such a collapse is
understandable if one considers that events in the remote past are so distant in120time that it is not possible to comment on what might or could have happened.
For this reason, the past irrealis mood is redundant and the marker is used to
signal remote past perfective.
The reader should not assume from the description of the remote past that
it is a tense used frequently. In fact, it is probably falling into disuse with speakers
preferring the more recent tenses even in narratives concerned with events in
the remote past. Only one text was collected in which the remote past was used
throughout a story and even then, there was a switch half-way to the past:
(3.154) netat aw koskir

'One old woman, she was living at Dopem .... Afterwards, they thought

Most narratives involving events which happened a long time ago begin
the story with the remote past and then switch immediately to the past:
(3.155) netat gerger-ge, eypu koki
kerker-ge, netat kimyar

'One day, in the middle of the monsoon season, a man and his daughter
whose name was Dewmer, were out fishing in their sailboat outside of
Mabyog... ' (Dewmer, p208, section2)
The Relation between the various uses of the morpheme wa-.
Why should it be the same prefix wa- recurring in these functions: i.e
future 3rd person, past irrealis, remote past? There is a thread binding all these
together. The future is often realised in many languages as the irrealis mood
because events concerned with the future are, by their very nature, uncertain.
Thus, there is a link between the future and the irrealis. In Meryam, future
events involving 3rd person may be the least certain events because the
participant is frequently absent from the speech act place and it involves someone
which neither speaker nor addressee have direct control over. Given that 3rd
person future expresses the greatest degree of uncertainty, it is the same121morpheme which is used to express past irrealis events and those so far removed
in time that they could be regarded as irrealis events themselves.
Why should the past irrealis and remote past be more closely related in
meaning to the 3rd person future marker than the irrealis noncommittal? The
irrealis noncommittal is concerned with the attitude of the speaker: I don't want
to say this will happen, I don't want to say this won't happen. In Meryam, such
an attitude is inappropriate with the past, be it irrealis or remote, as it deals with
events that have already happened or events that should or could have
happened but did not occur. The speaker would be essentially saying: I know
what happened but I don't want to say. Such a meaning is not part of the
message when the past irrealis or remote past are used and consequently, the
irrealis noncommittal is unsuitable for past (realised or non-realised) events.
Nonetheless, the forms of the future 3rd marker and that of the irrealis
noncommittal are clearly related, the unmarked/singular form of the latter being
homophonous with the former. These can probably be traced to a single
historical source. The different functions of the prefix/ suffix wa, i.e. irrealis
noncommittal, past irrealis, remote past and 3rd person future, are linked
together as they all deal in one way or another about what the speaker thinks is or
wants to say is the degree of certainty of the event's realisation.
3.8.3 Inherent Aspectual Features of Verbs.
Apart from the distinction of atelic stative from telic active verbs on
semantic and morphological grounds, there has been an implicit assumption
throughout the discussion on the meaning and function of temporal/ aspectual/
mood markers that all verbs can be affixed with these markers in order to yield a
meaning directly transparent to the verb root's meaning and the inflection.
Such a view is an over-simplification for it fails to account for the interaction
between verbs' meanings and inflections.
A number of verbs have an inherently punctiliar meaning, that is they are
all events that have no duration. Verbs in this semantic class include ewmi 'die',
baraygi 'Sg/DualS dive in', baw 'Sg/DualS go in'. Also included in this class are
verbs which involve a specific number such as erapey 'buy Sg/DualO', igared
'take animate Sg/DualO', etaruk 'pick up Sg/DualO', etaker 'gather up Pauc/PlO'.
Some of these verbs are not readily affixed with markers conveying a durative
meaning. Sometimes, such a meaning can only be conveyed periphrastically:
(3.156) kara
ama
ewd- em eke-Ii
lSgGen mothers dieN-All do?-PrlmpfSg
'My mother is dying.'
*kara ama ewmi-li
die- Prlmpf122For some verbs, only a related paucal/plural form that is indefinite in
number (or possibly generic in meaning) can be associated with durativity or
iterativity:
(3.157) able uteb- ge pe- ka
digwatIi...
Det place-Loe Deix-1SgA pull in Pauc/Pl fish-PrlmpfSg
'The place (where) I fish .. .'
*able uteb-ge pe-ka digwatmuIi
pull in Sg/Dual fish
The speaker is not saying that he catches many fish at that place nor that he
has caught many fish there. What is being conveyed is that it is the place
associated with a particular activity done at frequent intervals, namely fishing.
With some verbs, a semi-productive morpheme dar- must be used to allow
a non-punctiliar associated meaning of the verb (See end of chapter on NonProductive Derivations, p142):
(3.158) e
b(a)- ada(r)-li
3SgS Intr- put in Sg/DualO-?PrlmpfSg
'He is coming out.'
(3.159) ka mir
atrumda(r)-li
1SgA wordO suggest Sg/DualO-?- PrimpfSg
'I am suggesting something.'
Not all verbs can be affixed with this morpheme to produce such a
meaning:
(3.160) *e
ewpamada(r)-li
3SgS Sg/DualS jump-?PrlmpfSg
'He is jumping.'
..re ewpamaret-li
Pauc/PlS jump
For a number of verbs, temporal/ aspectual markers are exploited lexically
in order to derive a related but slightly different meaning. Thus, durative
marking on a punctual verb such as ewmi 'die' produces a different lexeme in
Meryam meaning 'ache, wither'. Similarly, a punctiliar verb such as igared 'take
Sg/DualO animate' can produce a different lexeme when a durative inflection is
suffixed, namely 'be living with Sg/DualO animate in a defacto relationship':
(3.161) kara
teter ewmi-li
1SgGen footS die- PrimpfSg
'My foot is aching.'
(3.162) e

"Previous Research on the Language.
Earlier work on Meryam has been limitgd in quantity and quality. In 1893,
Ray and Haddon published a study of vocabularies and grammatical notes drawn
from various missionaries', explorers' and researchers' notes. Unfortunately, the
study is subject to the contributors' spelling idiosyncracies, e.g. 'Maer' for Mer, to
interpretations of the sort: 'I think the variation of initial vowel is only due to
the influence of individual choice', and to dubious meanings because of personal
beliefs, e.g. omare 'mercy'.
The most extensive study is that of Ray (1907) which provides some 40
pages of grammar, 30 pages of vocabulary and 30 pages of texts. Such a study
provides the opportunity to compare earlier and later forms of the grammar.
A more recent work was undertaken by Bartos (1977), who provides a
preliminary study of the sounds of the language, and a paper by McConvell (1983};
who examines ergativity and verb agreement in the language to demonstrate that
Meryam cannot be said to be fully ergative or accusative in its system.
In addition, there are a number of primary sources such as texts produced
by Meryam students at the School of Australian Linguistics in the newsletter
Ngali and field notes kindly made available by Rigsby.",[14]

For some words, it feels intuitively that the adverbial function is primary

linguistic evidence to either refute or support such a claim.
Although it is not possible to isolate these words as being uniquely or even
primarily an adverb, their function is clearly adverbial. Adverbs contribute
information about the manner:

As can be noted from the examples, adverbs covered in this section do not
have any inflections or affixes. (Adverbial phrases do occur as illustrated in the
section on inflections). Their position is relatively free in the sentence although
they tend not to occur in word initial position.
Several of the words used adverbially appear in reduplicated form. This
might be done for two reasons. It may be to derive an adverb from a noun, i.e.
dudum-ge 'in haste' (lit: haste-Loe), dudum+dudum 'quickly'; nyay-em 'forever'
(lit: long time-All), nyay+nyay 'eternally'. Note that since this parallels
reduplicated forms for adjectives, reduplication could be viewed as a syntactic
144process for deriving nouns into modifiers, be they adjectives or adverbs.
However, somewhat similar to adjectives, reduplicated adverbs also imply a
greater intensity, i.e. mayk-e 'dose-by' (lit: close-Loe) versus mayk+mayk 'very
dose-by'. Thus, reduplication is both a syntactic and semantic process for adverbs
as well.","[154, 155, 156]"

-ipkem I elsewhere ex. Lez-ipkem 'in front of Les'
2.2.2 Syntactic versus Non-Syntactic Cases.
Criteria for distinguishing between syntactic and non-syntactic cases can be
established through the cross-reference markers on the verb. Arguments which
can be cross-referenced are: A, S and 0. The genitive may optionally be crossreferenced on the verb. Examples to illustrate cross-reference marking follow:
- cross-reference marking for S:1-----1
able neys werem ut
miwperedi
Det two childS sleepN 3n SgS-n PIS be lying-Prlmpf
'The two children are lying asleep.'
- cross-referencing for A (by a suffix):
(2.87)1------------------------1(2.88)wiable lu
erapeydarda
3n SgA Det thingO buy Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
'They bought the thing.'
- cross-referencing for 0 (by a prefix and suffix):
e
yabi
natakerda
3SgA 3n SgO 3n SgO-gather Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
'He gathered them (mangoes) up.'
- optional cross-referencing to genitive:
(2.89)1------,abra
werem (d)- ewsmeda
3SgGen childS 3Gen- Sg/DualS born-PfSg
'His child is/was born.'
*werem dewsmeda
(Note the above ungrammatical example when the verb is cross-referenced for an
absent genitive argument.)
The cross-reference markers permit a distinction to be drawn between the
cases as follows:(2.90)45Non-Syntactic:
Locative
Allative
Ablative
Instrumental
Associative
(Genitive)
The genitive can be listed in both categories as it can optionally be crossreferenced, it only occurs with 3rd person genitive and it is used mostly to
disambiguate the lack of coreference between a possessor of 0 and A or the
possessor of an incorporated nominal and S (see the section 3.6 p95 on Genitive
Marker for 3rd Person).

(Genitive)2.2.3 Other Inflectional Affixes.
1)
The nonsingular suffix -iba/-ibi is added to a singular noun in a complex
phrase to indicate that it is a member of a group of two or more. For example:
(2.91) kari
omay-iba mari omay-ey wi
ba- regley
1SgGen dog- n Sg 2SgGen dog- Dual 3n SgS Intr-bite flesh-nPrlmpfDual
'My dog and your dog, they bit each other.'
(2.92) wi
Sigar-iba nardar-dare omaskir-kem
3n SgA S.n Sg 3n SgO-see- Pauc children-Ass
'They saw Sigar along with his children.'
(?They, Sigar and his children, got seen.)
As exemplified in the two sentences given above (2.91 and 2.92), -iba
merely indicates one of a group of two or more. There are no instances of this
suffix occurring with inanimate nouns. Could this be because speakers are less
interested in number reference with inanimates? Typically, with inanimate
objects, the nouns are simply juxtaposed:
(2.93) e
tabara sarik kep- kem giz- ge irmi
3SgA 3Gen bow arrow-Ass trunk-Loe stick Pauc/PlO into-Pf
'He stuck his bow along with his arrow into the base of the tree.'
(Dewmer, p209, sections)
There is one example (2.94.) collected with -iba suffixed onto an inanimate
noun but it is an example collected through elicitation and the genitive case is
used within the complex phrase, a feature which is not normally permitted:
(2.94) ?ma kara
sogob- iba masis-ey narapey0
2SgA 1SgGen ciggies-n Sg <Eng- Dual 3n SgO-buy Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Buy my cigarettes and matches.'
The -iba suffix has been classified as an inflection for the following reasons:46•
The apparent restriction against the genitive case co-occurring with it in its
full form (excluding the example just given above). This is a restriction parallel
to that for inflections:
(2.95) taba koskiriba omasker-kem
3Gen (married)female-n Sg children- Ass
'his wife along with his children'
(2.96) *taba-ra koskir-iba omasker-kem
Gen
•
A distinction in the form when affixed to a noun in a non-syntactic case,
namely -ibi. Thus, there are basically two forms for this affix: -iba for syntactic
cases and -ibi for non-syntactic cases. Here are some examples with the form -ibi:
(2.97) ka bakyamu- da Sigar-ibi uteb- em omasker-kem
lSgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg S.n Sg place-All children-Ass
'I went to Sigar and his children's place.'
(Note that in the above example 2.97, the -ibi phrase seems to be in a genitive case
function which could be interpreted as evidence of the genitive's fluid status as a
syntactic or non-syntactic case.)
(2.98) ... pa- ka ta- ba Irwered-ge Mesnare-ybi- (i)m Eydyana-ey
Loe M.n Sg-All E. Dual

Webok-ibi- lam a
Babud-ey
B. S Deix middle-Loe n PIS be(place) W.n Sg-Abl Conj B.Dual
'Bewr is half-way between Webok and Badud.'
There is no distinction between the A, S or 0 argument when the
nonsingular inflection is affixed. Thus, one can use this suffix with an A
argument (2.100) or with an S argument (2.101):
ey lewer ti- dikasr-eyey
(2.100) Lez-iba koskirL. - n Sg (married)female-Dual foodO Deix-cook- PrlmpfDual

There is some ambiguity caused by this lack of distinction. With an
intransitive verb, there will only be one core argument so the -iba phrase will
have to be S. With a transitive verb, the non-iba phrase will either have an overt
ergative case marker for A or it will be marked overtly for 0 if it is a pronoun or a
proper noun. The only instance where it will be ambiguous is when a common
noun is the 0 as this will be the -0 case marker with no way of distinguishing 0
47from A. Of course, word order can always be used to disambiguate. Here is an
example where the overt 0 case marker on the personal pronoun allows the
addressee to interpret the -iba phrase as the A:
(2.102) neti- (i)ba yabi nerwer-da?
who-n Sg 3n Sg 3n Sg0-teach-P£Pl
'Who(pl) taught them?'
There is some diachronic and synchronic evidence which suggests that the
suffix -iba is related to the pronominal plural genitive case form (see section 2.3
p68 on Pronouns for more details). The nonsingular genitive pronominal forms
which are relevant to this discussion are:
1n Sg Exel keriba
Incl meriba
2n Sg
waba
3n Sg
wiyaba I yaba
The nonsingular forms which all end in -(i)ba correspond closely in form
as well as in function to the nominal nonsingular affix -iba.
In addition, Ray in his study (1893) gives the following examples to indicate
a pair or a group:
(2.103) keriba
Pasi-ey bakyamuley
Dawar-em
1n SgExclGen P.- Dual Sg/DualS go-PastDual D.All
'We (exd dual), Passi and I, went to Dawar.'(lbid; 61)
(the glosses are my own)
(2.104) mi
merbitkem namrida
1n Sglnd ln SglndO-Ass
1/2Sg?-Sg/DualS sit down-PfSg
'We sat down in one another's company/You sat down along with us.'(?)
(Ibid; 64)
Although there are no examples in Ray's data of this construction being
used with nominals such as those given for modern Meryam Mir, the reader
should note that in at least one of Ray's examples, the plural genitive pronoun is
used to indicate the plural pair. This parallels the examples found in the presentday language where the -iba is affixed to nominals for similar effect.
The earlier Meryam Mir examples both differ and resemble modern
Meryam Mir with regard to pronominals. Like the earlier form of the language, a
nonsingular pronoun is required in this construction:
(2.105) ki
ama- ey bakyamu- daryey
1n SgExdS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'We two, mother and I, went.'
(2.106) wi
ama- ypkem namreder
3n SgS mother-Ass
3n SgS-Pauc/PlS be seated-n Prlmpf
'They were seated, him along with the mothers.'
Note that if there is possession, it must be with the reduced form:48(2.107) kikerbi
ama- yey
ln SgExclS ln SgExdGen mother-Dual
'we two, our mother and I'
* ki kara amayey
lSgGen
* ki keriba
amayey
ln SgExclGen
* keriba amayey
'we two, mother and I'2)
The privative suffix -kak is added to (pro)nominals to indicate the absence
or the lack of something:
(2.108) e
barkak mir dike
3SgS crookedN-Priv word n PIS be(word)
'That is the right word.'
(lit: it is a word without crookedness)
(2.109) e

3SgS shame-Priv child n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a shameless child.'
(2.110) ka nole utkak n(a)- aIi
lSgS Neg sleepN-Priv 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'I am not sleepy.'
(lit: I am without sleep)
It can be used with pronouns or animate nouns as well to denote their
absence at a particular place:
(2.111) nole abi- tkak meta- ge irdiredi
Neg 3Sg0-Priv house-Loe n SgS be(place)-Pr
'He was not there at the house.'
(lit: There/It is without him at the house)
When it occurs within a noun phrase, it must precede the head noun and
the stem will operate in an adjectival or attributive function. As such, it might be
considered a derivation. For example:
ide abi epIi
(2.112) able mir- kak newrDet word-Priv unmarried female-A 3Sg0 carry Sg/DualO-Primpf
'The quiet silent girl is carrying him.'
Nominalised verbs can also be used with this affix:
a
bab
(2.113) ese ma aspir- kak apu
if 2SgS marryN-Priv mother Conj father
ma n(a)- aIi...
2SgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'If you are an unmarrried mother or father .. .'","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
"172There is a restriction on the occurrence of the deictic marker i and the
imperative: that is one can only specify a place in the imperative with the deictic
marker ge. Sentences with i/-y are unacceptable. Consider the following
examples:
(4.110) ma ge ero-e
2SgA Deix eat- Fut2/3
'Eat here/ Eat now(?).'
(4.111) ma ge ut
miwpe
dawa
2SgS Deix sleepN 1I2SgS-n PIS be lying n PIS be(person)-Irr
'Stay asleep here.'
(4.112) *ma i ero
*ma-y ero
*ma i ut nawpe dawa
*ma-y ut nawpe dawa
Note however that this is not determined by the presence of 2nd person
because in non-imperative sentences in the 2nd person, the deictic marker i is
acceptable (as is the marker ya):
(4.113) ma nanyay+nyay i
n(a)- awe
Mer-ge?
2SgS Q clitic-timeN.
Deix 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Fut2/3 M.I.-Loc
'How long will you be staying here on Murray?'
(4.114) aka ma i- ko bakyamue
sopkak?

'Are you going back again so quickly?'
(4.115) ma nade

ka- y
meta d-arpe
1SgA-Deix houseO l-Futl-1 sweep-Futl
'When you lie down, I will sweep the house.'
Why should there be such a restriction? Commands are inherently
concerned with getting the addressee to do something which s/he has not yet
been doing (thus a goal orienting effect) or telling him/her to keep on doing
something which s/he has been doing. The inherent goal orientation in the
imperative, may have caused the deictic marker ge to become an overt marker for
the imperative. Note however that the marker ge can never be used when the
goal is at the same place as the speaker, which suggests ge always refers to a place
away from the speaker, at least with a verb of motion. The direction/manner
marker ke(y) must always be used when the speaker is the goal. Consider:
(4.116) ma ke(y) ta- ba
2SgS way Deix-go
'Come this way I here.'
*magetaba173Yet with a verb of non-motion or a verb of location, the marker ge can be
used to indicate proximity to the speaker:
(4.117) ma ge namrie
kari-doge
2SgS Deix 1 /2SgS-n PIS sit down-Fut2/3 1Sg- Loe
'Sit down here, close to me.'
(The prefix marker na- on the verb is the S/O cross-reference marker being used
here to indicate close proximity to the speaker so there is no ambiguity as to
where the speaker wants the addressee to be located.)
It may be that the imperative carries some modal function conveying to the
addressee that something different will/ should/ ought to happen and thus, the
deictic marker that is associated with something different is used. Although no
evidence has been found in the data to account for the restriction in use of deictic
marker ge in the imperative, it should be noted that such a restriction does indeed
exist.
5)i - place associated with remote past
In the remote past, there is a restriction since only the marker i can be used.
Sentences with the same verbal marking and the deictic marker ge are
unacceptable:
(4.118) e
i
odali
Areb-ge
3SgS Deix RemPast-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf A.- Loe
'He used to live at Areb/ He was living at Areb (a long time ago).'
*e ge odali Arebge
(4.119) kikem taym, gab i
waykeredi Sebeg-(g)e
first
<Eng paths Deix RemPast-n PIS be(thing)-Pr S.Loe
'Formerly, there used to be a path at Sebeg/ Formerly, a long time ago,
there was a path at Sebeg.'
*kikem taym, gab ge waykeredi Sebege.
Contrast the examples above with those below where non-remote past is
used and the marker i cannot be used (at least in the non-future):
(4.120) e
ge dawer
Korog-e
3SgS Deix n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf K.Loe
'He was there at Korog.'
(4.121) e i dawer Koroge
*He was staying there at Korog.
(good: He will be here at Korog.)
(4.122) ka ge- ka abi erdar-i
1SgA Deix-1SgA 3Sg0 look- Pf
'I saw him there.' (earlier than today)
*ka ika abi erdari174Note that examples in the present are also unacceptable with the marker i
when these involve perfective marking on the verb:
i- ka
abi erdar-i
(4.123) *ka
'I saw him there.' (earlier today)
What is the motivation for the deictic marker i to be associated with the
remote past and for the deictic markers ge and pe to be associated with the past
and present respectively? In the same way as the imperative became obligatorily
used with the deictic marker ge because of its strong semantic orientation to a
goal, the distant past has become obligatorily used with the deictic marker i
because of its strong semantic orientation to a source. In other words, the remote
past locates events with respect to a beginning, the time from which other events
ensue. There is some evidence to support this interpretation since the remote
past frequently occurs only at the beginning of texts thus marking the location as a
source.
The occurrence of specific deictic markers, namely ge and i with certain
mood and aspectual features of the verb, may be an innovation, a diachronic
change being perceived at the sychronic level. As such, the deviance can be
regarded as an extension of the markers' meanings and functions.
The marker ya overlaps in its temporal reference with the marker i as it can
also be used in the remote past and future.
4.4ya1)ya - future (nonpunetual)
In the future, the marker ya occurs with non-punctual events, that is the
marker ya stresses more the durative or iterative nature of the event:

2SgS Q clitic-timeN?
Deix 1 /2SgS-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf
'How long will you be staying here?'
(the implication being that the stay is for a long period of time?)
Contrast these with the following i examples:

K.
3SgS Deix sleepN Fut3-Deix-n PIS be lying-n Prlmpf

2SgS Q clitic-timeN?
Deix l/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf M.1.- Loe
'How long will you be staying for here on Murray?'
(implication being that the stay is for a relatively short period?)
Note that a particular deictic marker does not necessarily restrict the
tense/aspect marking on the verb, so that, for example, only the marker ya can
occur with the nonpresent imperfective and the marker i only with the future
(punctiliar). Rather, one finds a slightly different perspective on the event
depending on the marker used. Thus, in the example where the speaker is asking
the addressee about the length of their stay, the marker ya could imply a long stay
whereas the use of the marker i, a shorter finite period.
There is a contrastive example in the data where the length of time is made
explicitly finite and i is used rather than ya which is unacceptable:

'I will be here until late afternoon.'
*ka yaka naw mena aw kikem watirpey
ya - distant in time/ space
In some examples, the marker ya seems to be used to indicate distance away
in time or space. Consider the following examples:
(4.130) ma ya temrio
2SgS Deix Deix-Sg/DualS sit down-Fut2/3
'Sit down over there.'
*ma ya emri
(i.e. it is unacceptable without the verbal deictic indicating distance)2)176(4.131) ka umer- kak ika n(a)- awer

2SgS Deix Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 2SgGen mid sun foodO Deix-eat-Fut2/3
'He will show it to Les so you go and have your lunch.'
(It is ambiguous from the example whether the location is close-by, at the
place of the speech act or distant.)
However, there are counter-examples in the data where the marker ya does
not refer to distant location. For example, in the following sentences, the location
is close-by:
(4.133) ka mena ya- ka n(a)- awer
able kige
lSgS still Deix-lSgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be (person)-n Prlmpf Det night-Loe

(4.134) e
3SgA still Deix L.- All Det Fut3-show- n Prlmpf
'He will keep on showing this to Les.'
These examples can be accounted for if one considers that the marker can
refer to either distance in space or in time and thus, in the first example, the
emphasis is on the distance in time and in the second example, the emphasis is
on the nonpunctual nature of the event.
There are also counter-examples where the marker ya seems to indicate
neither distance in time nor space:
(4.135) e

'You have been working all day, sit down (and) do not do anything; Kin01
will sweep the house now.'
These examples do not in fact conflict with the claim made about the
marker. Distance is a relative term and what one speaker may regard as distant,
another may regard as fairly close. In the above examples, the speakers are
interpreting the time lapse between the speech utterance and the future
realisation of the event in terms of distant (or possibly a more accurate
interpretation would be as non-immediate). Thus, the following utterances
employing the marker i are equally acceptable although the time lapse between
the utterance and the event is far smaller:
(4.137) e
i
wa- takomer-o
mayk-e
3SgS Deix Fut3-Deix-return- Fut2/3 close- Loe
'He will be back very soon.'
(4.138) Kinor-ide i
meta wa- dirup- o
K.A Deix houseO Fut3-sweep-Fut2/3
'Kinor will sweep the house right now.'
From the examples given, the generalization appears to be that the marker
ya is used to mark distance in time or space although this must be determined
within the context. This is not to say that there is no shared concept of such a
notion within the linguistic community for all speakers agree that the following
day to the speech act would be most appropriately expressed by the distant marker
ya:
(4.139) ma ya idimge akomer-o
Mackay-em?
2SgS Deix morning-Loe return- Fut2/3 M.All
Are you returning to Mackay in the morning?
3)ya - sequential in the future and remote past
The marker ya is also used to indicate sequentiality in the future or in the
remote past . To illustrate this, consider first examples in the future:

Only one example was collected where the marker was used to mark
sequentiality in the remote past:

'They went (and) stayed there; thus (when) their water ran out they then
had to stay on.'
It remains to be checked whether the marker ya is necessarily immediate
sequence, non-immediate sequence or either possible interpretation. It is not
possible to generalize about the remote past habitual on the basis of a single
example although it does not contradict those occurring in the future, i.e. it also
marks a sequential event.","[183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190]"
"181Deictic markers cover a wide range of functions. They are markers which
can contrast or highlight various elements of a sentence or utterance. Those
elements can be referents, events/states or entire propositions. The evidence
presented suggests that they are more discourse sensitive than syntax sensitive.
There is much overlap in function between what is described in many other
languages as switch-reference marking and these deictic markers. When they are
tracking referents, are they not marking these as being the same or different (or
new)? Furthermore, the correlation between temporal relations of switchreference systems and that of deictic markers' functions are again quite striking.
Switch-reference markers often indicate a temporal sequential and/ or
simultaneous relation with the previous clause parallel to the deictic markers)
although these often also include a logical relation with the previous clause.
It can be informally noted that the clauses with deictic markers pa and ga
generally involve a much tighter syntactic linkage with the antecedent clause
than deictic markers pe and ge. There are no instances in the data of pa and ga
occurring with a discourse initial clause. In contrast, markers pe and ge may or
may not occur with a discourse initial clause. Similarly, both markers i and ya can
occur discourse initially but only the marker ya marks a clause where the relation
to its antecedent clause is that of sequence or expressing some kind of logical
relation.","[192, 193]"
"182CHAPTER FIVE
BASIC SYNTAX5.1Introduction.
Before examining clause types, it is worth briefly mentioning that word
order tends to be A-0-V or S-V with local arguments either following or
preceding the nucleus. Variations on this order are presumably the result of
pragmatics although this awaits a detailed study. Roles and functions of
arguments are morphologically marked through case suffixes with syntactic cases
only being cross-referenced on the verb.
Causes.
A clause must minimally consist of a verb. This corresponds roughly to a
simple sentence if one includes a verb's arguments. Different types of simple
clauses can be broadly categorised as follows:
1.
Equational type clauses:
(5.1)
e
[aw sirib+sirib daIi]
3SgS big shameAdj n PIS be(person)-Primpf
'She is ashamed.'
(5.2)
lokot [pe irdi]
S. S Deix n PIS be(place,time)
'The bush is there.'
(5.3)
kara
ney
[Sir dike]
lSgGen names S. n PIS be(word)
'My name is Sir.'
2.
Experiencer type clauses:
(5.4)
yaba
werer barug- da
3n SgGen hungers happen-P£Pl
'They felt hungry.'
3.
An intransitive verb with an S argument:
(5.5)
e
emrida
3SgS Sg/DualS sit down-Pf
'He sat down.'
(i)]
[kobek esi(5.6)
newr
(unmarried) females cough bang down on waves-Pf
'The girl coughed.'
5.21834.
A transitive verb with an A and 0 argument (either explicit or implicit):
(5.7)
koskiride u
ikris- Ii
(married) female-A coconutO scrape-Prlmpf
'The woman is scraping a coconut.'
(5.8)
ka
emetu irw-i
lSgA finish eat-Pf
'I have eaten.'
(5.9)
able neys nar miwsriyey
Det two boatO 3n SgO-drag up on shore-PfDual
'The two boats got dragged up.'
(5.10) ka uteb [lumi dikris- i]
lSgA placeO weed scrape-Pf
'I cleared the place.'
5.
A di-transitive verb with an A and two 0 arguments:
(5.11) ka
abi bawr ikwari
lSgA 3Sg0 spearO give Sg/DualO-Pf
'I gave him a spear.'
(5.12) ka
abi zyawali etomeda
lSgA 3Sg0 bookO show Sg/DualA/0-PfSg
'I showed him the book.'
In addition, clauses may be extended by a number of peripheral adjuncts.
These include instrumental and comitative phrases, locational and temporal
phrases:
(5.13) ka ekyam- da ut- lam
lSgS wake up-PfSg sleep-Abl
'I woke up from (being) asleep.'
(5.14) abgerger-ge kole
ta- bakyamu- da tawn-em

'Yesterday, the European came to town.'
(5.15) ka lukupu
desaw-i
lSgA ointment-Instr rubPf
'I rubbed it with ointment.'
Clause types 1. and 2. will first be examined. Clause types 3. to 5. that is
intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs will only be discussed in the
context of determining which of their arguments are syntactic and which are
non-syntactic, and whether the verb's valency is fixed or with some variation.
Problems of this nature arise from the fact there are complex verb phrases in the
language and that not all arguments need be overtly expressed. Special attention
will be paid to cross-reference markers to show their role in this area.","[193, 194, 195]"
"1674.3i1)i - low deixis marker
When speakers are asked to contrast the markers i and pe/ge, they say the
latter typically involves gesture whereas i does not. A linguistic explanation for
this feature is that pe and ge are high deictic markers, i.e. they have a stronger
new information content and request a higher degree of focus or attention on
behalf of the addressee) whereas i is a low deictic marker and does not require the
same degree of focus or attention. Consider the following examples with pe
contrasted minimally with i:
(4.78) able cup
i
ike
Det <EngS Deix n PIS be(thing)
'The cup is over here.'
(where the cup is closer to the speaker than to the addressee)

state or location and hence a low deictic marker is used.i- place

Contrast the above examples with the following where the marker ge is

the goal can never coincide with the speaker:
(4.93) able lamar-ira burner ge ti- ditimdi

(4.95) ka ge- ka na- ba

As evidence that the marker i is associated with the source, consider the
following example where its occurrence with an ablative phrase is acceptable but
unacceptable with an allative noun phrase:
(4.96) mi
1- mi

uteb-lam

'We (incl) will now go from this place.'
*mi 1-mi na-bakyaw-dere uteb-em
All
The spatial notion can be extended to a temporal notion.
(4.92)i - future (punctual)/nonimperative
The marker i can also be used to mean 'from this point in time (onwards)'.
One can see from the translations given in the following examples that the spatial
use is extended in time where movement away from a place is parallel to events
moving away from now. Consider:
(4.97) Abob a

(4.98) ka
abi 1ka a- rdar-e
lSgA 3Sg0 Deix-lSgA Futl-see- Futl
'I will see him from now on.'
It is unclear whether it is the same homophonous reduced morpheme or
clitic -y attached to pronominals that is used with the meaning 'at that point in4)'I170time'. (It could possibly be glossed as 'from that point in time'.) With nominals,
the form ya (rather than i) tends to be used although the correlation might simply
be due to the lack of acoustic salience when -y is used. Here are some examples
with pronouns:
(4.99) ese ka na- bakyamulu

T.1.-em?
what 3SgS-Deix Fut3-Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 T.1.-All
'Is he going to T.I?'
This marker is not obligatory although clearly preferred in some instances.
Thus, in conditional/hypothetical sentences, it tends to occur whereas with
interrogatives, it may or may not be present. The shared meaning of i and -y
seems to be as a future marker but how is this use related to its use as a source
marker? These two functions do have one feature in common, namely that the
future marker i occurs with events that are either temporally or spatially close
and the source marker i must be, by definition, closer to the deictic centre, the
place of the speech act than the goal.
The distinction between its spatial and temporal use is not discrete and this
may be a contributing factor to the disagreement amongst speakers as to the
suitability and acceptability of sentences when i has future spatial reference.
For some speakers, the marker i can only be used to indicate a general area
close-by and/ or it involves an event in the immediate future. Thus, the
following sentence is unacceptable as it overtly marks distance away from the
speech act with the verbal deictic t(V)-:
(4.102) *ka ika ta- ra- mrilu
lSgS Deix-lSgS Deix-Futl-n PIS sit down-FutlSg
'I will sit down away from here.'
When it is 1st or 2nd person, distance away from the speech act must be
expressed with the deictic markers ge or ya:
(4.103) ka ge- ka ta- ra- mrilu
lSgS Deix-lSgS Deix-Futl-n PIS sit down-FutlSg
'I will sit down over there.'
(4.104) ka ya- ka ta- ra- mrilu

"IllIll is a voiced alveolar lateral which can sometimes sound quite 'dark' or
velarized when it occurs at the end of a word or syllable:
/1/
----->f I - #
mel'pcnr'black sea snake'
C
Ga.l'gal' 'nickname for Galiga'
BuMntt' 'place name'
manyapu~ 'pawpaw'
abal 'pandanus fruit'
-------->! I elsewhere
lam 'leaf'
goli 'squid sp.'
nalu 'what?'/ml
/n/
The voiced nasal stops are produced by air passing through the nasal
cavity with the lips pressed together for the bilabial stop and the tongue pressed
against the alveolar ridge for the alveolar stop. Note that the nasal stops
correspond to the point of articulation of the bilabial and apical stops although
there is a gap in the system as there is no nasal corresponding to the velar oral
stop.;w/
/y/
The glides include the bilabial continuant /w I and the palatal continuant
iy/. It is not dear-cut as to whether these are phonemically consonants or vowels
and the following discussion raises some of the reasons for considering each
analysis in preference to the other.
Arguments for considering the glides as underlying vowels:
(i)
There is a speech style called nasnas mir 'sorry talk' which is used by the
speaker to convey sympathy I grief for the topic (which might also be the
addressee). The phonetic change that takes place only affects verbs and more
specifically the initial vowel or vowel plus glide sequence in the verb. If the
initial vowel is /a/, then a glide /w/ is prefixed to it. If it is any other vowel or
vowel plus glide, these are deleted and a back vowel /u/, /o/ or /w/ is inserted:10#V[ +high,+front] C V[ +high,+front] ----> #u C V[+high,+front]
---> #(C) wa
#(C) a
-----> #(C) o
elsewhere
For example:
dwali 'n PIS be(person) Primpf'
da-li
---->
dogem 'walk'
digem
---->
or6 'eat'
er6
---->
iri
---->
uri 'smoke, drink'
When there is a vowel plus glide sequence, both phones are deleted and
replaced by a back vowel:
ewpamaret------> 6pamaret 'jump'
This provides some evidence that these are underlying vowels for the fact
is that the replacement by the vowel affects both vowel and glide if there is one.
This suggests that glides could be part of the vowel system as rules affecting
vowels also affect them.
On the other hand, it is generally regarded that glides do share features in
common with vowels and hence their frequent label as semi-vowels. The above
phonetic changes can simply be regarded as evidence of features in common
between vowels and glides.
(ii)
There is an example of a word that has the sequence glide plus vowel and
when it is abbreviated, the glide becomes syllabic which suggests it must be
underlyingly a vowel:
negwam ------>
negu 'cousin'
(i.e. w --> u)
Conversely, one can state the change in terms of a glide becoming syllabic when
there is no other vowel in the syllable.
(iii)
There is morphophonemic evidence that at least some verbs have as their
underlying form a vowel sequence rather than a vowel plus glide sequence:
b-6s 'pl S be born'
e-wsmer 'n PIS be born' (i.e. underlyingly eo)
parallel to:
ba-wm 'pl S die'
e-wmi 'nonpl s die' (i.e. underlyingly ew)
The use of the glide symbol in the word ewsmer obscures the
morphophonemic relationship between the sequence /ew/ and /o/ whereas if
one represents it as a vowel sequence /eo/ (with rules that apply later and
transform the sequence eo --->ew, the change is more transparent and easier to
account for. However, the relationship between the two forms is not always as
clear. If one considers the following examples where the future 1st person is
marked by the infixation of the vowel I a/, in the first example, i--->aw whilst in
the second example, i---->ay:
diski 'open Sg/DualO'
I Idawskilu 'open Sg/DualO Futl'
dimi 'close Sg/DualO'
daymilu 'close Sg/DualO Futl'
Thus, the rule can only be formulated very generally stating that an
accented vowel will become a vowel plus glide sequence when an affix (prefix or
infix) is attached. Is it appropriate to use morphology to prove something in the
domain of phonology? Whilst it is the linguist's task to assemble data from all
areas and assess these in relation to each other, it does not necessarily follow that
an analysis in one area justifies a particular analysis in a different area.
(iv) There are examples in the data where the vowel plus glide sequence
sounds like a complex rather than a single peak; it sounds like two syllables
rather than a single syllable. Examples contrasting single and complex peaks
follow:
peybri-peibri 'name of a clan, moiety(?)'(3syll) peym 'dream'(lsyll)
bawr- baur 'spear'(2syll)
baw 'enter'(lsyll)
Bewr- Beur 'village name'(2syll)
Dew 'village name'(lsyll)
Note that if the examples in the first group were transcribed with the extra
syllable (e.g. eyi), then there could be no claim that the underlying forms were a
monophone vowel sequence as they would represent a sequence of two syllables
with the glide marking a syllable boundary. On the other hand, if these were
transcribed as a single syllable (e.g. eyC), the task would remain to account for
why the first group of words sound different to the second group and if these are
phonetically as opposed to phonemically distinct.
There are two complex peaks in the following environments:
(i) There is an accented vowel I e/ and palatal glide followed by a voiced
consonant cluster, e.g. peybri [pefuri] 'clan name', eyrsida [eirsida] 'SgS moored
(Pf)'. Contrast with: neys [neys] 'two', peym [peym] 'dream', deyb [deyb]
'swelling, mound'.
(ii) There is a front accented vowel and bilabial glide followed by a consonant,
e.g. ewmida [eumida] 'SgS die (Pf)', gewm [geum] 'fear', iwri [iilri] - ewri [euri]
'SgS weave (Pf)', newr [neur] 'unmarried female', newd [neud] 'parrot fish',
ewsmeda [eusmeda] 'SgS come out (Pf)', ewtmer [eutmer] 'ask'. Contrast with:
new [new] 'ripe', Dew [dew] 'village name'.
(iii) There is an accented vowel and glide followed by a voiced consonant /r /,
e.g. toyr [t6ir] 'fat', gayr [gafr] 'many', wawr [waur] 'type of wind', bawr [baur]
'spear', teyr [tefr] 'decorated'. Contrast with: ays [ays] 'bring Pauc/PlO', Koyti
[k6yti] 'name of person', waw [waw] 'yes', Bawz [bawz] 'name of village', awmkep
[awmkep] 'type of cloud', aydir+aydir [aydir+aydir] 'lie Adj'.
The same data could be examined reaching the conclusion that a vowel
sequence is a valid analysis. Glides do share features with vowels and their12ability to become syllabic or maybe make the syllable sound longer is a
consequence of one such feature.
Arguments for considering the glides as underlying consonants.
(i)
There are only sequences of vowel plus glides or glides plus vowels within
the one syllable. Other vowel sequences always occur over two syllables with a
glide intervening although it may not be very prominant, e.g. kayed
'grandparent', keyar 'crayfish', eyu 'type of grass', iyu 'tears Instr', Mowa 'island
name'. Phonotactically, the glide occurs in a position typically occupied by a
consonant and thus, could be regarded as part of the consonant system.
(ii)
With some lexemes, there are examples of two glides and a vowel within
the one syllable:
syaw 'sneeze'
bway 'kinspeople'
way 'seed inside the coconut'
yey 'large blind shark'
waw 'yes, hole'
If glides are analysed as underlying vowels, then an account must be made
in the phonotactics of a possible sequence of three vowels- a somewhat unusual
phenomenon amongst languages of the world. If, however, the glides are
analysed as underlying consonants, then a sequence eve can be hypothesized- a
pattern which can be found elsewhere in the language.
The analysis of glides as consonants will still require further specification
in the phonotactic outline of the language because the only clusters that are
permitted word initially are those of a consonant plus glide type.
(iii)
Glides will have to be postulated to account for their use across morpheme
boundaries:
tutu-em-tutuw-em 'type of doll-all'
,
,
'tears-ms
• tr
1-u-1y-u
6+o-6w+o 'courageous' (lit: liver+liver)
le-em-ley-em-le-m 'person-all'
IThe decision as to whether glides are part of the consonant system or part
of the vowel system cannot be made at this stage of the analysis. More data and
evidence needs to be collected. In this analysis, glides will be presented as part of
the consonant system although this is only tentative.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"

Number Markers for S of Intransitive Telic Verbs by Prefixes.
Some intransitive telic verbs carry plural number information by means of
a prefix ba-. Those verbs marking plurality by means of a prefix (as opposed to a
suffix) are all predictable insofar as they all begin with a vowel in their
(underlying) verb root:
b- 6g- i

Complications arise from the fact that this marker is homophonous with
the intransitive marker ba- and it is sometimes used to mark both functions or one or the other:

"The Language and its Speakers.
Meryam Mir is one of three languages spoken in the Torres Strait, that
stretch of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea (see Kmao lh.
!Ca.klw a.Wo.w d J
on p. iv). The other two languages are Kala Lagaw Ya (also known ast\1(alaw
Lagaw Langgus, Mabuiag or Yagar Yagar, see Kennedy 1985 and Ford and Ober
1987; 1), which is spoken on the Western islands, and Torres Strait Creole (also
known as Broken, Pizin, Big Thap, Blaikman or Ailan Tok, see Shnukal, 1988; 3)
which is the lingua franca of the region. Meryam Mir was spoken throughout
the Eastern islands of Erub (Darnley Island), Ugar.(Stephen Island) and Mer
(Murray Island). However, with the ever-increasing use of Creole, Meryam Mir
has been seriously impinged upon and, as a consequence, it is being spoken less
and less in these communities. The number of speakers are estimated to be
approximately 700 (Wurm, 1977; 328)1 which presumably includes Eastern Torres
Strait Islanders living on other islands of the Torres Strait and on the mainland
of Australia in cities such as Townsville, Cairns or Mackay.
The name itself, Meryam Mir, is drawn from the word mir meaning 'word,
language' and from the name of one of the clans living on Mer, the Meryam
people (from Mer 'Murray Island' and the morpheme -(y)am '(?)of a clan, of a
place'). It frequently appears in the literature written as Miriam or Meriam (Mir)
but to be consistent with the orthography used in this study, Meryam (Mir) is
chosen.
Meryam Mir has an agglutinating morphology employing both prefixes
and suffixes. Its word order is basically A-0-V or S-V with the verb always in
word final position but with variation on the arguments' order depending on
pragmatic features. It has an extensive system of cross-reference markers on the
verb coding information about the number, person and syntactic nature of the
arguments as well as case inflections suffixed on nouns to indicate their syntactic
function within a clause. Thus, Meryam Mir can be regarded in typological
terms as a double-marking language (Nichols 1986; 72).
2.",[12]
"152What evidence is there for claiming these markers are marking the goal and
not say, the place or source? Example 4.22 was unacceptable when the marker ge
was used with an overt ablative phrase and acceptable with 4.21 with an overt
allative phrase:
(4.21) mi
ge- mi
na- bakyawdere
uteb- em
1n SglnclS Deix-1n SglnclS Fut1-Pauc/PlS go-FutPauc place-All
'We few will go to a place.'
(4.22) *mi ge-mi na-bakyaw-dere uteb-lam
Abl
Given the unacceptability of the marker ge with the ablative phrase (and
presumably the same result would occur with pe although this remains to be
tested) and given that these markers occur with verbs of motion, one can
conclude that they refer to a goal. (See the later section on i where the converse is
true; that is the marker i can co-occur with an ablative phrase but not with an
allative phrase.)
pe, ge - focus on new I different event/ state
There are examples in the data where the markers pe and ge can sometimes
be glossed as 'now' or 'then', which suggests a temporal meaning. However, they
may be indicating to the addressee to focus on the event itself because it was not
occurring before. Neither interpretation is incompatible with the other. They
could be explicated as:
something is happening/happened;
before this time, it was not happening
at this time, it is happening/happened.

The temporal meaning assigned to these markers does not exclude them
from carrying simultaneously spatial meanings as well. One can see from the
examples given above that it is sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to assign a
spatial or temporal meaning to them exclusively. Such is the case in the
following example:
(4.29) ka pe- ka n(a)- aIi
lSgS Deix-lSgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'It is me here now.'
(This was said by someone who had just arrived at a new place and was
introducing himself to a friend of his father's i.e. new place and/or focus
on new event.)
(4.26)pe, ge - focus on new I different referent
The markers pe and ge can also be used to focus on a new referent or to
reintroduce an established referent. This is sometimes done to overtly contrast
one referent with another but at other times, the opposition is, or seems to be,
only implied between one referent and a set of other potential referents. Whether
this latter case is one of its functions or merely an inference is not something
which can be proved with the current corpus of data. To illustrate its use, consider
the following examples:
(4.30) naged newr pe daIi?
Q clitic-land girlS Deix n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'What island is that girl from?'
(talking about an island girl that has just come into their field of vision

"160Although the time when the language changed predates the time of the
speech utterance, the present deictic marker is used because the language remains
different to this day.
2)pa, ga - focus on same referent
There are examples where the deictic markers pa and ga maintain focus on
the same referent. The use of the term 'same referent' is used for a semantic/
discourse-based notion rather than a syntactic-based one. As details of complex
sentence structures are documented and analysed, it may emerge that features
such as langu~ge pivot and types of subordinating structures will have a bearing
on the postulated meaning of the pa/ ga construction. However, as a preliminary
note, it can be stated that the deictic markers depend upon a semantic notion of
referent. Sentences, where the shared referent is in fact a syntactic argument, will
be pointed out to the reader and the possibility of analysing such constructions as
syntactically motivated will be explored following the pertinent examples:

'They(2) went (and) built the rock wall; they started at Teker, they built the
rock wall from Teker as far as Korog (where) it juts out and so that same
rock wall is still standing because of their building endeavours.'
The deictic marker pa is focussing on the same referent namely the 0 of the
verb dfrbir 'build' and the S of the verb dararbir 'be built'. The clause mena
Korog ewpamada which intervenes between the two clauses containing the same
referent say may in the light of further data be analysed as a subordinate structure
and so, the deictic marker pa could in this example be regarded as marking as
same referent, a syntactic argument and as operating across clauses.

"28CHAPTER TWO
NOMINALS
In this chapter, the different parts of speech will be briefly examined beforelooking at nominals.
2.1Parts of Speech.
The following parts of speech need to be distinguished:
Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
Pronouns
Adverbs
Deictic Markers
Clause Relators
Exclamations/Interjections
Nouns.
Nouns are an open word class including both concrete or abstract nouns.
Concepts such as hunger, thirst, fatness and width are expressed in the language
as nouns; for example, 6mar 'good feeling', weku 'anger', werer 'hunger', nyap
'thirst', dob 'fatness', deg 'width', piri 'height', new 'ripeness, blister', kiris
'rawness'. This class of words is inflected for case through suffixes. Within this
class, a distinction needs to be drawn between common nouns, which inflect by
distinguishing A from S/O,and proper nouns, which inflect differently for all
three cases. There are many compound nouns formed with either two nouns,
e.g. kerim le 'boss' (kerim 'head' and le 'person'), or a nominalized verb and
noun, e.g. aro+aro tup 'sardines' (< ero 'eat'+ tup 'sardine').
Verbs.
Verbs are an open class of words which refer to either states, e.g. ut ipe 'be
asleep', processes, e.g. esk 'flow', edug 'burn', or events, e.g. ewmi 'die', ero 'eat'.
The verb has inflections carrying aspectual/ temporal information as well as
number /person agreement cross-referencing syntactic arguments. These markers
provide the formal characteristics that permit verbs to be categorised into two
classes. These two classes,, have some semantic correlation dividing atelic
statives from telic process verbs although class membership can be purely formal.
For example, an event such as ikase 'go along' is classified, at least
morphologicall~ as an intransitive atelic stative verb, i.e. 'be going along'.","[39, 40]"
"149In the above example, it is not the contrast between the noun phrases whichtriggers the different forms but the different time reference. This is illustrated by
the following example where the two noun phrases are contrasted but the forms
do not alter as the states coincide with the time of the speech act:
(4.3)
kcira
bawr pe ilce
1SgGen spearS Deix n PlS be(thing)
nole able le
pe t- ilce
Neg Det one/persons Deix Deix-n PlSbe(thing)
'This is my spear, not that one.'
The same marker ge is used with events or states that occur following the
speech act or at least continue on after the time of the utterance. Although there
are no examples contrasting present and nonpresent within a single sentence,
there are elicited examples which show the ungrammaticality of using a present
marker in a nonpresent context:
(4.4)
ma ge emrie
2SgS Deix Sg/DualS sit down-Fut 2/3

*ma pe emri
(4.5)
ma ge nami
daw(w)a
2SgS Deix 1/2SgS-n PlS be seated n PlS be(person)-Irr
'Remain seated there.'
*ma pe nami dawa
There are a number of features and functions associated with the markers
pe and ge which are examined below.
4.2.2 pe,ge1)pe, ge - new location
The markers are often exploited to focus on a new location or to mark a
contrast with a previous location. Speakers comment that the place is often
indicated through gesture. Here are some examples with pe to illustrate this
meaning:
(4.6)
irmer ni

'The rain water (tank) is here.'

idimge key wa- ta- ba
morning-Loe way Fut3-Deix-go
'He is there in Cairns, he will be coming back in the morning.'
Several facts emerge from the examples. The deictic marker does not
indicate relative proximity or distance to the speaker I speech act because the same
marker can be used whether the speaker is pointing to a place close-by or referring
to a place away from the speech act. Relative distance is marked by the deictic on
the verb t(V)- . The deictic marker denotes a place that either the addressee was
not focussing on previously or a place where the referent was not situated before
or only after some point in time and thus can be regarded as a new location.
These examples could also be interpreted as having a presentative/locational
function, Le. 'there is X', or 'Xis/was there'.
With the non-present, the presentative function is absent and the
nonpresent marker ge is used to indicate a new place or one which the addressee
has not been focussing on. Here are some examples with ge to illustrate its
meaning:
(4.11) ma ge emrio

The temporal reference of nonpresent sometimes appears to also include
the present when referring to habitual events and probably means something
like: it is always this way and will always be this way. It might also be indicating
that it is not occurring at the time of the speech act but does indeed happen, i.e. a
kind of present irrealis. For example:
(3.93) Lez w- ekyam-dar-er
gayr idimge idim
kakar- ge
L.S Fut3-get up- ?- n Prlmpf many morning-Loe morning Intens-Loc
'Les will always get up most mornings very early.'
(3.94) Lez no w- ewsmedar-er
lokot telam
L.S Restr Fut3-n PIS come out-?- n Prlmpf bush opening-Ab!
'Les will always only come out from the back door.'
(The discussion of the morpheme/root form -dar- will be delayed until the end of
the section outlining the meanings and functions of the Non-Productive
Derivations p142.)
Perfective.
The suffixes in this category are in their broad meaning nonfuture markers
used for events that are completed,, or about to be completed, at the time of the
speech act. They thus encode a temporal feature of nonfuture as well as an
aspectual feature of perfectivity. To illustrate their meaning, here are a few
examples:
(3.95) ka paret ti- dirp- i
lSgA dustO Deix-sweep-Pf

meriba
aw lar ak(e)meyda weris- u
1SgA ln SglnclGen big fishO scoop Sg/DualO-Pfsg fish trap-Instr
'I have scooped up our big fish with the fish trap.'
There are instances where the nonfuture perfective is used for events that
are not yet completed at the time of the utterance. Such events are punctiliar and
the perfective is used to indicate that the outcome or achievement is inevitable
and imminent. It is for this reason that it is appropriate the marker should
involve a temporal element, namely, the nonfuture. Consider the following
examples where the imminent realisation and the punctuality of the event
necessitate the perfective:
(3.98) ka pe- ka wabi dikayrt-i
1SgA Deix-1SgA 2n SgO leave- Pf
'I will now leave you (pl) here.'
(3.99) ka
pe- ka mari namri-da
1SgA Deix-1SgA 2Sg0 1 /2Sg0-sit- PfSg
'I am now leaving you (sg) here.'
The perfective suffixes are also used to indicate a change of state, something
that has re~ulted from a process:
(3.100) kara
tag pim ismida
1SgGen hand finger cut Sg/DualO-PfSg
'My finger got cut.'
(3.101) awmkep
ba- kmerikda
cloud types Intr-put down Sg/DualO-PfSg
'The cloud has gathered itself up above.'
(3.102) able nar eyrsida
Det boats caught on reef-PfSg
'The boat has become caught on the reef.'
(3.103) pamas ba- ymida
shop Intr-close Sg/DualO-PfSg
'The shop is closed, i.e. it has become closed.'
Contrast the above example (3.103) with that below (3.104) which is a
nominalised verb used in an ascriptive sentence and involves a state, not a
change of state:
(3.104) able pamas aymir+aymir ike(redi)
Det shops close N.
n PIS be(thing)-Pr
'The shop is closed.'
108One feature that distinguishes change of state perfective verbs from statives
is the alteration in meaning of the adverb emetu 'already'. When it is used with
a change of state, it implies a recent change. When it is used with a state, it
implies that the state has been like that for some time.
(3.105) pamas emetu ba-ymi-da
(change of state)
'The shop is now closed.'
(3.106) pamas emetu aymir+aymir ilce
(state)
'The shop is already closed (and has been for a while).'
Many problems still remain with the perfective marker used for changes of
state: What is the syntactic function and semantic role of the noun phrase in
such sentences? Does the nominal have the syntactic function of S or is it still 0
with the A omitted yet somehow still recoverable? Is it always the same function
and role?
NonPresent-Future-Past.
The markers for future and past have been grouped together on the basis of
their similarity in form as well as in function. What distinguishes them from
other markers is their reference to nonpresent time. Furthermore, the future
forms and the past forms closely resemble each other although person
distinctions are made for the future which are absent for the past. Given the
limited data and understanding of the nonpresent-past, it is best to keep these
two tenses discrete in the analysis.
Future-NonPresent.
It is pertinent to begin the discussion on future tense by examining its
prefix forms. These involve the markers wa- for 3rd person and (n)a- for 1st
person.
(3.107) e
wa- ditar-0
3SgA Fut3-write-Fut2/3
'He will write (it).'
(3.108) ka d-awtar- e
1SgA 1-Futl- I write-Futl
'I will write (it).'
(3.109) e
wey-ekweyreder
3SgS Fut3-be standing-n Pr
'He will be standing.'
The future markers are prefixed to both telic and atelic verbs although
when the first person future marker is prefixed to a 1st person atelic stative verb,
it cannot be distinguished from the 1/2Sg/Pl marker given these are
homophonous:109(3.110) ka ya- ka nakweyreder adge
lSgS Deix-lSgS 1/2Sg/Pl+Futl-be standing-n Pr outside-Loe
'I will be standing outside later.'
The reader might be tempted to regard future markers as discontinuous
morphemes consisting of a prefix and suffix. Such an approach would fail to
recognise that both these prefixes and suffixes can occur with non-future
temporal reference and that it is the combination of these forms which gives
them their future meaning. As such, they can be regarded as co-occurring
morphemes.
The future is used with all events or states which will begin some time in
the future (with the exception of habitual events as discussed above where the
event is specified as occurring all the time although not necessarily at the time of
the speech act).
(3.111) sogi o- ba- sirik-o
grassS Fut3-Intr-bum-Fut2/3
'The grass will burn.'
(3.112) idimge ka able sogi ya- ka d-asirik- lu

'In the morning, I will bum the grass.'
(3.113) ta- ba mi

'Come, let us eat.'
(3.114) ka na- ba kab na- rye
lSgS Futl-go dance Futl-dance-Futl
'I am going to dance.'
It can also be used for events that may have already commenced at the time
of the speech act but are expected to continue for some time. Consider the
following example where the act of eating has already commenced but the
speaker wishes to convey the notion that it will continue to happen. This is in
contrast with the present imperfective where there is no such expectation:
(3.115) ka umer- kak na- bakyamu- lu,

short while longer. I will follow you later.'","[117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"38These are the only examples collected ending with -im.
8.
The ablative case (-lam/-ilam), like the allative case, has local, temporal
and causal meanings. It is used to mark the point from which there is
movement away:
(2.51) e
op- dewday- lam ta- bakyamu- da
3SgS face-mainland-Ahl Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
'He came from Papua New Guinea.'
(2.52) e
tabi paser-lam
3SgS Deix-climb down-Pf hill- Ahl
'He came down from the hill.'
This case inflection can also be used to mark the cause (of a non-finite
clause):
(2.53) ka gim+gim n(a)- aIi
waywi aro- lam
lSgS illness Adj 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf mangoO eatN-Abl
'I am sick from eating mangoes.'
It can also be extended in meaning to include a temporal notion, i.e. to
mark from a particular point in time:
(2.54) ki-lam 'from/ since last night'
emeret-lam 'from a long time ago'
9.
The genitive case (-ira - -ra) is used to mark the beneficiary or goal of an
action:
(2.55) ka laglag epey
a- rapeylu
kari
ama- ra
lSgS wantN basketO Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg lSgGen mother-Gen
'I want to buy a basket for my mother.'
Note that there is overlap in the functions of the allative case with its
purposive function and the genitive case with its beneficiary function. (It remains
to be tested whether it can also be used as a maleficiary.) It could be argued that in
Meryam Mir, the genitive case includes within its meaning both a benefactive
and purposive meaning. This would account for the more felicitous and
common sentence given below with the genitive rather than the allative case:
(2.56) kara
mekir
ageg
tiruko
lSgGen almond(tree) fleshy fruit?O Deix-pluck PIO-Fut2/3sg
'Pick me some almonds.'
?kari-m mekir ageg tiruk
-All
The two cases, namely the genitive and allative case, must have some
overlap in their function as well as permitting some slight nuance in meaning
because there are examples where the two cases co-occur within a single sentence:39(2.57)ka abra
kerkar wali
ti- d- irapeyda
1SgA 3SgGen fresh clothingO Deix-3Gen-buy Sg/DualO-PfSg
tciwn-ge abi- m
town-Loe 3Sg-All
'I bought him a new shirt in town.'
Clearly more work needs to be done in this area to refine the distinctions
between the allative and genitive cases.
The genitive case is used to mark the possessor/owner of an alienable or
inalienable object/physical quality /person/body part:
asr- i
(2.58) ka pleyn-ira bUm.er dlsgA <Eng- Gen soundO 3Gen-hear-Pf
'I heard the plane's noise.'
(2.59) Warib-ira tag

Gen hand/fingers cut- PfSg
W.'W arib's finger got cut.'
(2.60) Lez-ira newbet ewmi-da
L.- Gen FZ S die- PfSg
'Les' aunty died.'
The genitive case can also be used to mark the experiencer of a physical or
emotional state:
bark- i
(2.61) Galiga-ra werer
Gen hungers happen-Pf
G.'Galiga is hungry /Hunger happened for Galiga.'
(2.62) able lera weku bark- i
Det person-Gen angers happen-Pf
'That person is angry I Anger happened for that person.'
The genitive case cannot occur when the complex noun phrase itself is
marked by a case as in the following examples. In 2.63, it cannot occur with the
locative case; in 2.64, it cannot occur with the ergative case; in 2.65, it cannot
occur with the semblative case and in 2.66, it cannot occur within a noun phrase
itself marked by the genitive case:

'This is my mother's basket I My mother's basket is here.'
*kara amara epey pe ikeredi
1SgGen
The ending suffixed or pronominal form for the absent genitive is
phonologically homophonous with the 0 argument case form for proper nouns,
i.e. -i,or the accusative pronominal form. One could speculate that the case
marker for this argument is the accusative/ dative case marker as it is used in
adnominal possession, it is typically the base for oblique inflections on proper
nouns and pronouns and, it is used to mark definite or human direct objects.
Another possibility is that there are alternations in the form of the genitive case
morpheme itself, i.e. -i ,.. -y, used when the complex noun phrase in which it
occurs carries another case inflection. Evidence that these are indeed
morphological alternations of the genitive case can be seen by the fact that these
case markers also occur with common nouns (which do not take the case suffix -i
in the accusative case) when they are in a possessor relation within a case-marked
complex phrase:
(2.67) kari
newr-i
kimyaride abi detagr-i
1SgGen girl- Gen (married)male-A 3Sg0 tell- Pf
'My daughter's husband told him.'
Contrast with the lexical compound newr kimyar 'sister-in-law' where
there is no genitive marking (2.83):
(2.68) kari newr kimyaride abi detagri
'My sister-in-law told him.'
Another example follows of a common noun suffixed with the alternative
form of the genitive case:
(2.69) able amay werm-et abi detagr-i
Det mother-Gen child- SgA 3Sg0 tell- Pf
'The mother's son told him.'
*able ama wermet abi detagri
Although the genitive case marker cannot be confused with the accusative
case marker in the examples given above, there are many examples in the third
person singular where these two functions cannot be distinguished, that is where
the (pro)nominal phrase could be analysed as the 0 argument or as the
phonologically reduced genitive case. For example:
41ka abi
kerim-ge ipit-i
lSgA 3Sg0-gen? head- Loe hit- Pf
'I hit him on the head/ I hit (him) on his head.'
(2.71) ka abi

(This ambiguity is only present in the singular third person because 1st /2nd
person objects or 3rd person non-singular objects will be cross-referenced on the
verb.)

-ra IVex. ama-ra werem 'mother's child'

ex. newr-ira omay 'the girl's dog'
(2.70)10.
The associative case (-kem) is suffixed to an inanimate noun to indicate
that it was associated although not used to perform the action:
(2.73) e
digm-i koketkem
3SgS walk- Pf walking stick-Ass
'He walked (carrying) his walking stick.'

-Instr
'He walked using his walking stick.'
(2.77) wi
mir- u
ba- ke-ley
3n SgS word-Instr Intr-do-PastDual
'They (2) insulted each other.'
(lit: they (2) did things to each other using words)
The associative case -kem and the allomorph -ipkem (used with proper
nouns and possibly with kinship terms, e.g. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers),42are used to indicate that the person was associated with a particular event
although not a participant:
(2.78) lu
ba- kawerti Lez-ipkem
thingS Intr-take down Sg/DualO-Pf L.- Ass
'The things were unloaded in Les' presence.'
A similar form and parallel use occurs with pronominals:
(2.79) Dawgiri erkep ikereder
ge Bame-y erdar-i
0 see- Pf
D. S
eye n PIS be(thing)-n Prlmpf Deix Bta- ba- rb- i abi-tkem we- ge akarik-da
Deix-Intr-row-Pf 3Sg-Ass sand-Loe land- PfSg
'Dawgiri was watching when he saw Bame swimming (towards the area
where Dawgiri was) and right in front of Dawgiri, Bame came up onto the
beach.' (Dewmer p210, section12)
Andrews (1985) makes a useful distinction between circumstantial and
participatory roles which correspond neatly to the associative versus
instrumental case. The associative case involves a circumstantial role as the
phrase forms ""part of the setting of the event"" whilst the instrumental case
involves a participatory role with the phrasE; an ""actual participant in the
situation implied by the verb"" (Andrews, Ibid; 69). An argument marked with
-kem/-ipkem is signalling that the thing/person was present although not an
instrument or participant in the activity.
How does the associative differ from the locative when the locative case
carries a comitative meaning? Whilst the locative case is marked on an animate
noun to indicate thats/he performed the same action at the same place as the
S/ A, the associative case is also marked on an animate noun but to indicate that
s/he was at the same place although not performing the event/activity.
However, there is a further use of the associative suffix which is exploited in a
participatory role to indicate paucal or plural inclusion; in this use, it is always
within a complex noun phrase. This function will be examined in the following
section.
Number marking within a complex phrase.
The suffixes -ey 'Dual' and -kem 'Pauc/Pl or Associative' are used within a
complex phrase to indicate that the phrase is dual or paucal/plural respectively:
(2.80) able bab taba newrey...
Det father 3Gen (unmarried)female-Dual
'The father with his daughter.. .' (Dewmer, p208, section4)
(2.81) ...epe Mesnare-yba Eydyana-ey abi ti- ditagr-iyey...
3SgA?-Deix M.n Sg E.Dual 3Sg0 Deix-tell- PfDual
' ... where Mesnare and Eidiana told her .. .'","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"5.2.2 Experiencer type Clauses.
There is only one verb which has been collected to date where the
agreement on the verb appears to be determined by the number of the possessor,
not the number of the possessed. Consider the following examples:
(5.30) kara
nyap bark- i
1SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
'I am thirsty I Thirst happened to me.'
(5.31) yaba
nyap barug- da
3n SgGen thirstS happen-PfPl
'They were thirsty I Thirst happened to them.'
(5.32) keriba
werer bark- iyey
ln SgExclGen hungers happen-PfDual
'We two (excl.) are hungry I Hunger happened to us (excl).'
The experience itself could be regarded as either the same phenomenon
shared by all experiencers, in which case, one would expect singular marking on
the verb or it could be regarded as a phenomenon experienced individually by
each of the experiencers. It is this latter interpretation which is suggested by the
verbal marking. Alternatively, the structure suggests that the possessor has
subject properties by virtue of its initial position in the clause and verb
agreement.
Both this construction and equational clauses can be used for experiences.
The distinction between the two is unclear:186(5.33)e
nyap-ge daIi
3SgS thirst-Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is thirsty.'
(5.34) abra
nyap bark- i
3SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
'He is (now) thirsty I Thirst happened to him.'
The distinction may be that existential sentences convey a state whereas
experiencer type clauses convey a change of state, or it may be that one state is
more permanent than another. Examples need to be elicited to test whether both
types can be modified by the same set of adverbial/temporal modifiers:
?e no kerkar nyapge dali/?abra nyap no kerkar bark-i 'He is just recently thirsty.'
?e emetu nyap-ge daw-i/?abra nyap emetu bark-i 'He was already thirsty.'
?'He is always thirsty.'
5.3The Verb Complex.
There are a number of uninflected nominals occurring within a sentence.
These must be considered as part of the verb complex. Consider the following
examples:
(5.35) ter mayso [mir iga- Ii]
reef noises word speak-Prlmpf
'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.36) Galiga [ut iperedi]
G.S
sleep n PIS be lying-Pr
'Galiga is sleeping.'
The nominals mir 'word' and ut 'sleep' must be part of the verbal phrase
for the following reasons. The verbs given above are intransitive as evidenced by
zero marking on the S argument so the non-S argument cannot be 0. Its
function must be part of the verb phrase. Other arguments found in support of
this analysis follow.
Nominals in the verbal phrase must occur immediately preceding the verb,
which suggests they form a syntactic unit:
(5.37) *mir ter mayso igali
'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.38) *ut Galiga iperedi
'Galiga is sleeping.'
There is some suprasegmental evidence that the nominal and verb form a
single phonological unit. The main pitch-accent of the verb phrase is carried on
the nominal when it is mono-syllabic and the verb itself begins with a vowel,
e.g. tit ipe 'n PIS be lying asleep', but ipe 'n PIS be lying'.
However, there are instances where the nominal's role is not
straightforward and it could either be a verbal nominal (i.e. within the verbal
187complex) or a syntactic argument of the verb. Consider the following examples
where the verb might be di-transitive or transitive with a complex verb phrase:
(5.39) koskiride lumi dikris-li
uteb- ge
(married)female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
'The woman is clearing her place.'
(5.40) koskiride (uteb) lumi dikris-li
(married)female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
'The woman is clearing (her place).'
In 5.39, number reference for the nonA nominal (be it 0 or whatever) is
automatically plural and no further cross-reference marking can be used. As 0
arguments for transitive verbs can be cross-referenced on the verb for number,
one must assume that the nominal is not an 0 and thus part of the verb complex.
Contrasting with this, in 5.40, number specification for 0 is singular, referring to
the number of yards, and cross-reference marking can be used to indicate
nonsingular number as exemplified below:
(5.41) koskiride neys uteb lumi da-rakris- i
(married)female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf
'The woman cleared two yards.'
(5.42) koskiride neys a
netat uteb lumi da-rakris- idare
(married)female-A two Conj one placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pauc
'The woman cleared several yards.'
(5.43) koskiride mitkar uteb lumi da-rakris- a
(married)female-A many placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pl
'The woman cleared many yards.'
The cross-reference markers for 0 provide syntactic evidence that the
nominal lurni 'weed' is part of the verbal complex and not an 0 argument.
Given that there are complex verbal phrases in the language, it may be
possible to interpret one of the arguments of a di-transitive verb as a nominal
within the verb phrase rather than a syntactic argument. Consider an example
with a di-transitive verb such as ikwar 'give':
(5.44) ka
abi lu
ikwari
lSgA 3Sg0 thingO give Sg/DualO-Pf
'I gave him something.'
(5.45) ka
abi lu
nakwari
lSgA 3Sg0 thingO 3n SgO-give sg/ dualO-Pf
'I gave him two things.'
(cross-reference marking to the inanimate 0 argument lu 'thing')
(5.46) ka
yabi lu
na- kwarda
lSgA 3n SgO thingO 3n Sg-give Sg/DualO-PfFl
'I gave them something.'
(cross-reference marking to the animate 0 argument yabi '3n SgO')188As either of the nonA nominals can be cross-referenced on the verb (5.45
and 5.46), one must assume that both nominals are syntactic arguments of the
verb with the specification that only one of the arguments can be cross-referenced
at any one time on the verb. More examples need to be collected with (di)transitive verbs to prove this.
A couple of transitive verbs have been collected where the nominal can
either be part of the verb complex or a syntactic argument:
(5.47) ka
mara mir
asr- i
1SgA 2SgGen wordO hear-Pf
'I heard your message.'
ditkiri(i)
(5.48) ka lar- ira gepi
1SgA fish-Gen scalesO peel,scrape-Pf
'I scaled the fish.'
mari mir n(a)asr- i
(5.49) ka
1SgA 2Sg0 word 1/2Sg0-hear-Pf
'I heard you (talking).'
(5.50) ka kumala
gegur ditkiri(i)
1SgA sweet potatoO peel peel,scrape-Pf
'I peeled the sweet potato.'
It is unclear what the semantic distinction is between the two types. One
possibility may be that the nominal incorporated into the verbal phrase (5.49 and
5.50) is indefinite whilst the non-incorporated nominal (5.47 and 5.48) is definite.
An alternative explanation would be that the incorporated nominal focusses on
the activity itself whilst the non-incorporated nominal focusses on an end-point,
a purpose. Note, however, that for many verbs, there is no choice.
There are examples of lexicalised complex verb phrases, that is where the
noun is an inseparable part of the verb phrase and its meaning. Examples of
lexicalised complex verb phrases include for intransitive verbs: i ezo 'cry'
(<tearN, shed?), erer ekri 'shout, squawk' (<shoutN, emit?), segur etker 'play'
(<playN, ?), kobek esi 'cough' (<coughN, bang down upon waves), and for
transitive verbs: upi diti 'help' (<tail?,?), lag dasur 'smell' (<smellN, ?), tag
digwat 'shake hands' (<hand, pull), op dipit 'meet' (<face, hit?), tep diskir 'taste'
(<skin of fruit, activity to do with mouth?).
Within complex verbal phrases, a nominal can always be isolated from the
verbal component because verbal inflections occur only on the verb, not on the
nominal, and the nominal can always occur as an independent lexeme. It seems
that the generalization is as follows: at one end of the continuum, there are
nominals functioning as syntactic arguments of the verb and at the other end of
the continuum, there are nominals within verbal phrases forming an essential
part of the verb phrase's meaning. In between these two extremes, there are189some verbs which allow both types to occur and these are exploited for various
stylistic purposes.

5.4The Noun Complex.
The structure of a noun complex is as follows:Determiner-N[modifier]Adjective
lNoun-GenlN[head]- giz 'Pl'
·(iba-ibi 'n Sg') £N-kem 'Ass'
N-ey 'Dual'l(5.51)[able mitkar epey ] pe da-ramar
Det many baskets Deix I -3n SgS- I PIS be resting upon
'The many baskets are there (resting upon something).'
(5.52) [able kebi bam+bam nar ] pe ikase
Det little tumeric Adj boats Deix be going along
'The little yellow van is going by.'
(5.53) lim-ira bi
sun-Gen light
'sunlight'
Case inflections are suffixed to the head or clitic immediately following the
head, i.e. giz, iba-ibi. Genitive nouns follow the order with the possessor (the
modifier) preceding the possessed (the head).
The plural marker -giz(e) always directly follows the noun which it
modifies:
(5.54) gayr legize kari natager-da
alot person-PIA lSgO 1/2Sg0-tell- P£Pl
'Alot of people told me.'
The marker -giz(e) behaves like inflections, which are always suffixed to the
noun. It can be regarded as a post-clitic since it forms a single phonological unit
with the noun, i.e. there is a single pitch-accent, e.g. netat le '1 person', gayr le-giz
'many people'.
Not included in the structure of the noun complex outlined above are
locational adjuncts often involving a nominal and a locational noun acting like a
kind of postposition. Both are inflected for case:
(5.55) ka [pon- ge muy- ge] nazirkedi
lSgS <Eng-Loe inside-Loe 1/2Sg/PlS-Sg/DualS be inside-Pr
'I was inside the phone box.'","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"
"19There are no consonant clusters that can occur word-initially or word-finally
although as mentioned in the previous section, consonant plus glide clusters can
occur word-initially, and glide plus consonant clusters can occur word-finally.
The types of consonant clusters which can occur in word-medial position
are not restricted and gaps in their occurrence are likely to be due to the paucity of
data rather than actual restrictions. This apparent freedom in cluster types is the
result of nouns and verbs formed into complex stems, processes such as
reduplication and vowel deletion with certain conjugations and affixation of
certain morphemes. The examples given in the section on syllables indicated
that an analysis which relies on the occurrence of phoneme sequences alone, i.e.
a phonotactic study, will fail to predict why some consonant clusters are
acceptable whilst others are not (such as consonant clusters at word boundaries).
It was suggested that a closer examination of the internal structure of the syllable
might be a more profitable way of looking at the data. An alternative approach
would be to examine whether clusters differ within a word root as opposed to at a
morpheme boundary. It is not always, however, apparent where the root
boundaries are.
This study will restrict itself to giving examples and listing the consonant
clusters that have been collected.
The basic phonotactic structure of a word is as follows:
(C1)V(CC2V)(C3t
where
V=any vowel
u 'coconut (tree)'
e '3SgA/S'
i 'tears', deictic marker
a conjunction
o 'liver'
Cl= all consonants (glides are included in this category) can occur word initiallyexcept /r/
One word has been collected starting with /r/ namely rom 'type of dark
cloud which appears out at sea'. However, this word only appears in a song and
may have been borrowed from Kalaw Lagaw Ya or some other language.

Note that the form *le-yba is unacceptable even though other common
nouns can be suffixed with this form. In contrast, the form -giz can be suffixed to
le 'person; according to some speakers,but not to other common nouns according
to others, e.g. ?kimyar-giz 'men (PIS)'.
Although there are gaps in the examples illustrating all the case functions
and number distinctions, a tentative gloss and presentation of the paradigm is
given:
nete 'who SgS'
neti 'who SgO'
netide 'who SgA'
?netiba 'who n SgA/S/O'
and:
na-le 'which person SgS/O'
na-lelut 'which person SgA'
na-le-gize 'which people n SgA'
?na-le-giz 'which people n SgS/O'
The two groups given above can be paraphrased by each other in most
contexts although only the second group can be used for indefinite pronouns:

(Dewmer, p209, section7)74Contrast 2.274 where the pronominal is indefinite with the following
example (2.275) where the pronominal is definite:

Informants have said nalulu is the same as nalu 'what O'. However, the
English gloss might be better captured by 'what kind of X', i.e. what kind of thing
did they get up to yesterday at Dew? What kind of happiness is he feeling? (i.e.
what is the cause?). In other words, nalulu may be the interrogative word used
for asking information about a component of a compound. In order to verify this
claim, questions need to be elicited of the type:
What kind of hair does he have?
What type of house does he live in?
What kind of bananas do you grow? etc.
2.4Adjectives.
The class of adjectives is somewhat problematic in terms of isolating its
members and determining what are its characteristics. The following words are
tentatively classed as adjectives: aw 'big, old', kebi 'little, young', debe 'good',
adud 'bad'. Also included in the adjective word class are the determiner/
demonstrative and quantifier words: able-ale 'determiner I demonstrative', netat
'one', nerut 'another', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several', mitkar 'alot',
gayr 'many'.
Criteria used for determining class membership is not based so much on
what they are as on what they are not. These words typically occur in a modifier
function (although they sometimes can occur as nouns). All words functioning
as adjectives precede the noun they modify or directly precede the existential/
locational verb:75(2.278) able kebi werem i ezo- Ii
Det little childS tear shed-Prlmpf
'The little boy is crying.'
(2.279) debe lag+lag
good want
'Nice flavour.'
(2.280) debe le
good person
'Good one!'
(2.281) wader koskir
several (married)female
'several women'
(2.282) nole ko
adud ike
Neg again bad n PIS be(thing)
'It does not matter.'
(lit: it is not bad (here) either)
Examples have been collected where adjectives are being used with a degree
function:
(2.283) e
aw-kaka kebi werem daIi
3SgS big-Intens little child n PIS be(person)-Primpf
'He is a very small child.'
In the above example, aw 'big' is not functioning as an adjective but as a
modifier of the adjective kebi 'little' to intensify it. (It would be pertinent to see
whether it can occur without the intensifier, e.g. ?e aw kebi werem dfili 'He is
slightly younger.')
In the two examples below (2.284 and 2.285), the reduplicated form is being
used with a distributive function:
(2.284) wi
netat+netat taba agud-em erer ba- krier
3n SgS one
3Gen god-. All shout PIS-cry out-n Prlmpf
'They cried out one by one to their god/They each cried out to their god.'
(2.285) able pazar tabara netat+netat ba- tager-da...
Det crews 3Gen one
Intr-tell- PWl
'The sailors said to each other.. .'
(Both of the above examples are from the manuscript of a biblical translation of
Jonah.)
Most words functioning as adjectives are derived from the noun word class
through a process of reduplication. Using Dixon's semantic types of adjectives
(1982), the following words in adjective function occur:761) dimension:
piri+piri 'long'
tewpay 'short'<piri 'length'
<tewpay 'shortness'
ex. tewpay-em 'for a short while'
<deg 'width'
<dob 'fatness'
<?toyrdeg+deg 'wide'
d6b+dob 'fat'
-toyr+toyr 'fat'
2) physical properties:
kela(r)+kela(r) 'strong, hard' <kelar 'strength'
geb+geb 'soft, cold'
<geb 'cold'
beber+beber 'heavy'
<beber 'weight'
per+per 'light, clear (colour) <per 'light weight, mirror'
zur+zur 'rough'
<?zur 'roughness'
urweri(+urweri) 'hot'
<?urweri 'heat'
kurap+kurap 'bitter'
<kurab 'bitterness'
neru+neru 'sweet'
<neru 'sugarcane'
3) colour:
goli+goli 'dark'
<goli 'squid sp.'
za(r)zer+za(r)zer 'white'
<zarzer 'whiteness'
mamam+mamam 'red'
<mam 'blood'
bam+bam 'yellow'
<barn 'turmeric'
4) human propensity:
serer+serer 'happy'
<serer 'happiness'
pardar+pardar 'clever'
<pardar 'wisdom'
5) age:
peret 'old (of thing)'
<?emeret 'ancient time'
6) value:
<?sek 'badness'
sek+sek 'bad'
<sek 'badness' + kak 'privative'?
sikak 'okay, well'
parko+parko 'imperfect'
<parko 'defect'
7) speed:
<dudum 'haste'
dudum+dudum 'quick'
korider+korider 'fast'
<korider 'speed'
wapum+wapum 'slow'
<?wapum 'slowness'
Several items functioning as adjectives are homophonous in form with
nouns. Should these simply be labelled 'nominals'? In such cases, there is no
morphological or syntactic evidence to suggest that there is any derivation
involved and thus, there is no justification for two word classes.
It remains to be checked whether the reduplicated form is possible at all
and/ or whether it intensifies its meaning:
?e tewpay+tewpay le 'he (is) a very short person'77?peret+peret wali 'very old clothes'
There are also some examples where the adjective can occur either
reduplicated or not (see also section on comparison with nominal compounds
p65):
(2.286) urweri ni
heat
water
'hot water, tea'
(2.287) aw-kaka urweri+urweri gerger pe ike
big-Intens heat Adj
dayS Deix n PIS be(thing)
'It is a really hot day today.'
(2.288) ...a ba- keri nar- lam beber lu
erepda
Conj PlS-Pauc/PlS do-Pf boat-Abl heavy thingO grab Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
ad- em dikrida
out-All throw Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
'... and they started grabbing the heavy things and throwing them
overboard.'
(from the manuscript of the bible translation of Jonah)
(2.289) aw beber+beber werem daIi
big heavy Adj childS n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a very heavy child.'
The reader can note that the reduplicated form is associated with an
intensified meaning. It is not possible to say whether this meaning is obtained
from an adverbial function or a meaning that can be attributed to the
reduplicated form of the adjective. As this hypothesis was not considered during
fieldwork, no examples have been elicited to test it. The reduplicated form needs
to be tested for an attenuative meaning as well. The examples demonstrate the
possibility that reduplication can also be a semantic device.
Rigsby (p.c) suggests that the reduplicated form has a proprietive meaning
and gives as an example:
(2.290) tulik+tulik le
knife
person
'person with a knife'
No such examples were collected with the current corpus of data so no
comment can be made. However, there are examples where the associative case
has a proprietive meaning:
(2.291) mir- kem le
word-Ass person
'preacher' (lit: word-having person) (cf. 2.129)
(2.292) ged- kem le
land-Ass person
'land owner' (lit: land-having person) (cf. 2.130)78Of course, it may be that reduplication and the use of the associative suffixhave a general proprietive meaning with slight semantic differences between the
two.
There is one example in the data where a proprietive meaning is the only
interpretation possible and yet there is no reduplicated form nor the presence of
the associative suffix:
(2.293) ese ka no
if lSgS Restr
aw bakir le
wan(a)aIi...
big stone person RemPast-1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'H only I had had a lot of money.. .'
It would seem on the basis of the above example that a proprietive
meaning cannot be the sole function of the reduplicated form.
Some words always occur in a reduplicated form when functioning as
adjectives. Such is the case with colour terms, e.g. bam+bam 'yellow', where
reduplication is a signal of its function, i.e. a syntactic device, to mark a
derivational process. The two uses of reduplication are not necessarily
incompatible and there may be instances where syntactic uses and semantics
converge. More data will have to be collected to test such a claim.
Is there a basis for postulating a distinct word class of adjectives? For at
least a small closed class of words whose function is primarily to modify nouns,
an adjective category is appropriate. For other words operating in this function,
one can simply specify that they are nominals which for some will be
reduplicated to mark their adjectival function and for others, to mark intensity.","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"

The same referent in the above example could be one of two arguments. It
could be co-referent with the A, Wayer pit legize 'the people from Wayer point'
or co-referent with the 0, abi (Bame) '3Sg0' since both are the same syntactic
arguments.

in pain, Dawgiri and Wayda ran, hit him, cracking open his head with the
club.' (Dewmer, p213, sections 24 to 27)
In the last example, the first use of the deictic marker ga is unproblematic
and marks as same referent bab 'father' which is S in both clauses. However, the
second use of the marker does not appear to be referring back to any common
syntactic argument of the previous clause, unless nerkep 'heart' and sarup
'castaway' are viewed as the same referent given that one is a part of the other
and the referents are the same by virtue of one being an inalienable part of the
other. Clearly such an interpretation requires an extensive treatment of syntactic
features in complex sentence structures.
There is evidence of nonfinite clauses with the deictic markers used to
introduce a purposive clause also indicating the same referent is involved:

'People travel to these 2 islands to fish and also to look for turtles.'
(Frank Kaigey, Mekikem, Ngali no.9, Dec. 1984)
3)pa, ga - same event/ state
Some of the examples with the deictic markers indicate that it is the same
event/ state as that of a previous event or state, i.e. someone else also does the
same I someone else does it the same way. Semantically, the deictic markers
appear to have scope over a larger unit than just a referent and are operating over
the whole proposition. Of course, a category distinction between 'same referent'163and 'same event/ state' is arbitrary as many examples involve the same referent a5
well. Consider:
(4.65) ki
ge- ki

Kinor ga dawer
K.
Deix n PIS be(person)-n Prlmpf
'We(excl) were there, Kinor was also there.'
The two examples above were chosen as the deictic markers have the same
function w;th ·only the temporal reference Q5 different. The S of the pa/ ga clause
could be said to be included within the S of the previous clause as it is a plural
pronoun of which the S of the second clause is a part. In both of these, the
function of the deictics could be analysed as indicating the same place. However,
the example below provides counter-evidence for this hypothesis:
(4.67) netat post ge isk- i, nerut post ga t- isk- i
one <EngS Deix stick-Pf another <EngS Deix Deix-stick-Pf
'One post was stuck in there, the other post was also stuck over there.'
(The deictic markers are referring to different places.)
This example also demonstrates there is no restriction on referents being
the same in both clauses unless the two posts are thought of as a pair, i.e. one is a
part of the other and vice versa (after all, it was two posts of a clothes line!) If a
category marking the same event/ state is proposed then the absence or presence
of co-referent arguments is not an issue.
Another example to illustrate this use follows:
(4.68) Geygi baka b6zer erdar-o

'Geygi went, saw a small eel, so (he) speared the small eel, held it up to his
mother: 'Mother, what (kind of) fish is it?' Nageg said to him: 'The164small eel is an edible fish.', and so he (that same one) went off again,
speared a large eel, also held it up: 'Mother, what (kind of) fish is it?""
The gloss proposed by the speaker for the deictic marker ga was 'again' but it
is unclear whether he was referring to the referent, i.e. Geygi, or the events, i.e.
going off again and pointing something out to his mother again. The same
problem is encountered in the example below where the deictic marker could be
indicating the same A or 0, or it could be indicating a repetition of the event:
(4.69) ese ma abi erdar-wa, abi ga detager-wa
if 2SgA 3Sg0 see- Irr 3Sg0 Deix tellIrr
'If you should see him, then you should also tell him.'
(i.e. tell him what I have told him or what you have told him before)
Some examples have been collected with the deictic marker used within a
phrase:
(4.70) Nageg pa- ko
abra werem Geygi,
N.S Deix-again 3SgGen childS G.S?
wi
oda-r(a)aIi
Ne-ge
3n SgS RemPast-1 - 3n SgS-1 n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf N.- Loe
'Nageg and also her child Geygi were living at Ne.'
Would one want to consider the presence or absence of an immediate verb
as the criterion for determining whether the deictic marker is operating within a
phrase or over the whole clause?
4)pa, ga - logical relation
In all the examples with the deictic markers pa and ga, there is also a
relation of logical dependency as encountered with the markers pe and ge. The
logical relation might be, as discussed earlier, a temporal one marking a sequence
or partial overlap between one clause and the previous one or a relation
indicating a result or consequence. The temporal relation, although similar to
that of the deictic markers pe and ge, generally involves a closer unity in time
between the clause and its antecedent. It also requires the antecedent clause to
bear a causal relationship to the following clause. Here are some examples to
illustrate the meaning of the deictic markers when they are marking both a
temporal and logical relation with the previous clause:

She, in turn, looked out: ""Hey, so it is also as a octopus now (which I

There are examples in the data which appear to contradict the temporal
restriction that the deictic markers pe and pa can only occur in the present.
Consider the following examples where the markers are used in the nonpresent
and more specifically the past:

'We (excl) were dancing at Gigo, they were then dancing with their right
hand while I was dancing with my left hand.'
There is also one example where the deictic marker ge is being used with
present temporal reference:

1n SgExclS Deix-ln SgExclS Deix-n PIS be(person)-PrPauc
Ii
Kinor pa daK.S Deix n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'We (few) were there (earlier), Kinor was there too.'
There are various explanations which fit the different examples but no
single explanation accounts for all of them. At first glance, it seems that the
present deictic markers are being introduced sometimes to give the text a 'lively'
feel about it; this is what is often labelled the present narrative. In some cases,
they are used for events/states that lie outside the narrative proper, e.g. that one
which I am now talking about/ this one which I am now talking about. A closer
look will reveal that the most plausible and convincing explanation combines a
number of inter-related factors.
The deictic marker pe is becoming exclusively used for animate subjects
which are contrastive in function. Thi~ in turn, contrasts with the marker ge
which is used in the single example in the present with inanimate non-subjects to
mark a place. The deictic marker pa is also losing its temporal reference for a
different reason. The marker frequently occurs with stative verbs which are
losing their temporal reference because of phonological reduction in their forms
(see the introductory section on Tense/ Aspect/ Mood/Number Suffixes, p100).
(4.75)The distinction between the markers discussed above (i.e. pe, pa and ge, ga)
and the markers i and ya are examined below.","[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"

The intensifier -kar is affixed to nouns to indicate the superlative of the
type, the most characteristic. As examples were given earlier, these will not be
repeated.
Examples need to be elicited with case inflections to see whether these are
grammatical or not:
? ukar- ide kari napit-i
coconut-Intens-A lSgO 1/2Sg0-hit-Pf
'The actual palm tree hit me.'
With this affix, some stems are inflectional, others are lexicalised.
Consider:
(2.128) !ewer
'food'
-kar
'intensifier'
lewer-kar 'type of yam' (lit: real food)
2.2.4 Derivations.
1)
There is a derivational suffix -kem homophonous with the associative case
suffix which derives adjectives from nouns. Whether or not this is a productive,
semi-productive or lexical device remains to be seen as only two examples have
been collected so far. Its meaning can be roughly glossed as 'characterised by' or
'having the characteristic of':
(2.129) mir- kem le
word-Ass person
'a preacher'
(2.130) ged- kem le
land-Ass person
'land-owner'
2)
Nominals (both nouns and adjectives) can be derived from verbs through
a regular phonological process which involves the initial (consonant plus) vowel
of the verb changing. Some examples of nominalised verbs being used as an
adjective or noun follow:52(2.131) e
o- bakyamu lewer arap- em
3SgS Fut3-Sg/DualS go foodO buyN-All
'He will go buy food.' (cf. 2.39)
(2.132) akasir+akasir lu
ikeredi
cook Adj
things n PIS be(thing)-Pr
'(It)'s a cooking utensil.'
As the reader may have noted, the adjectival derivation process can
involve reduplication as well although it is still the same process:
erap 'buy' verb --> arap noun
dikasir 'cook' verb--> akasir noun
The derivational process is as follows:
verbs--------------> nominals
The initial consonant, if there is one, is deleted.
A stressed word initial vowel /6/ becomes /aw/:
#(C) 6 -------- > # aw
An example is:
6g 'climb'--> awgog 'the climb' (as well as reduplication of verbal root?)
(the derivation might be from: aw(g) 'big'+og 'climb')
A stressed word initial vowel /f/ becomes I ay I when it is followed by a single
consonant and /i/. It becomes /aw/ elsewhere:
#(C) r - - - - > #ay / - c 1 i
------->#aw I elsewhere
Examples include:
dfmi 'close'---> aymir+aymir 'closed Adj'
dfski 'open'---> awskir 'tombstone opening'
(Note that verbs ending with a vowel have /r/ suffixed as well.)
A stressed word initial vowel I e/ becomes I a/ if it is followed by a glide and it
remains the same elsewhere:
#(C) e -------> #a I - c [+glide]
----------> #e I elsewhere
Examples include:
ewsmer 'go out, be born'---> awsmer 'birthday'
eydi 'lie down'---> aydir+aydir lu 'mattress'
erwer 'learn'---> erwer meta 'school' (lit: learnN+house)
(One counter-example has been collected in the data where ew -----> #ew,
e.g. ewmi 'die'---> ewd+ewd 'deadly' *awd+awd. However, as the derivation
also involves a change in the consonant, i.e. m ---> d, this could be an irregular
or unrelated form.)53A stressed word initial I a/ remains the same:
#(C) a. ---------->#a
An example follows:
akem 'dip'---> akem 'dippingN'
An unstressed initial vowel becomes I a/:#(C)V ------------>#a
Examples include:
dirmisir 'start'---> armisir 'beginning'
ero 'eat'---> aro+aro 'edible'
akarik 'land'--> akarik 'landing'
okayret 'break (of dawn)'---> akayret 'daybreak'
erap 'buy'--> arap le 'vendor'
dikasir 'cook' ---> akasir le 'cook'542.2.5 Nominal Compounds.
Many examples occur in the data of several nouns juxtaposed within a
single phrase. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that these are
compounds and can be categorised into different types, lexical and syntactic. A
comparison will be made between compounds and modified nominals as well as
complex noun phrases involving the genitive construction, to show similarities
and differences. Compounds are the result of a morphological or lexical process
whereas modified nominals, be they adjectives or genitive constructions, are the
result of a syntactic process.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"

'You lot>alongside with Ron, worked on Monday.'
Note that the suffixes are affixed to a noun phrase which is part of a more
complex noun phrase, be it a pronoun or another noun.
Inclusion is an essential feature of this construction. If a pronoun occurs, it
must refer to the sum of the participants and the associative or dual phrase is
subordinate to it. Note that the cross-reference markers always treat the complex
noun phrase as non-singular. Below are examples to demonstrate the
grammaticality with a nonsingular pronoun and the unacceptability with a
singular pronoun:
(2.85) wa
net- ipkem bakyawda pamas-em?

1n SgExclS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual shop- All
'We, mother and I, went to the shops.'
*ka amaey bakyamudaryey pamasem
It remains to be established whether the use of the associative suffix is a
distinct function and meaning. In this use, it has noun phrase function rather
than clause function. Clearly, however, the two uses are related in meaning.
Participation in the event is marked by the case of the complex whole noun
phrase and by the verbal cross-referencing.
Several sentence types need to be elicited in order to validate these claims:
• whether the associative phrase can ever be linked to an 0 argument, e.g. I saw
the man with his walking stick, or, I saw the man walking with his brother.
• whether the associative phrase can be used with a transitive verb with a plural
agent, e.g. They unloaded the things in front of Les (who did not help at all).
• whether the nonsingular marker attached to the first nominal in the complex
phrase can be omitted when it is an animate, e.g. Sigar omasker-kem bakyawda
Dawarem 'Sigar and his children went to Dawar.'","[54, 55]"
"155(In this example, it is not possible to determine whether the deictic markeris used for a temporal effect or to focus on a different referent.)

'He kept on cutting down light things (wood) (and) throwing them into
the water, they in turn would just float (so he) would throw them away.'
(An important point to note from the above example is the use of 3rd person
singular pronoun in the second clause: e-ge ... which does not in fact correlate
with the S/ A of the verb in terms of number, i.e. it is marking plural instead of
singular. One would expect to have a nonsingular pronoun. This might lead one
to suspect that it is not the pronoun being marked by the deictic but the event,
clause or even the whole proposition. More about this will be said shortly.)
The use of the deictic markers to focus or contrast referents is further
exploited to introduce a clause that makes the referent specific, i.e. it is used as a
kind of restrictive relative clause marker. It would be premature to label such
constructions as restrictive relative clauses without having undertaken a full156study of complex sentences and such a study is beyond the scope of this work.
However, such a use should be noted and can be exemplified:

5)pe, ge - focus on different proposition
There are examples where the deictic markers cannot be readily identified as
focussing on specific referents but rather on whole propositions.1 either in the form
of a single predicate proposition or of a multi-predicate proposition.

(Dewmer, p212, section18)6)pe, ge - logical relation
Many of the instances of deictic markers serving to focus on referents or
propositions involve a relation of logical dependency. This logical relation might
be, at the very least, a temporal relation marking a sequence or partial overlap
between one proposition and the previous one (such as in the t.lCatortes quoted
above) but sometimes it indicates a result/ consequence:

Note how the contrast is established between pe and ge in the above
example where direct speech involving events of the 'here' and 'now' or of
earlier on the same day have the form pe whereas events narrated such as
'tell'and belonging to the past are reported by the form ge.

(Dewmer, p208, section4)159It may be that the logical relationship established between two referents orpropositions is the result of inference and not part of the meaning proper of the
deictic markers themselves. This is an area requiring further investigation.
4.2.3 pa,ga
1)pa - relative to present time/ space; ga - relative to nonpresent time/ space
The same temporal distinctions as pe and ge serve to contrast the related
deictic markers pa and ga which can both be defined roughly as having the same
referent or event/state as a previous proposition. The difference between pa and
ga lies in their temporal reference. Pa is restricted to the present, ga to the
nonpresent as defined earlier. Note that the marker pa can include states which
began earlier than the day of the speech act and remain current at the time of the
speech act utterance. The following examples illustrate the time distinctions:

The reason for the ungrammatical sentence given above is that the present

Number Markers for 0 by Suffixes.
The previous section discussed how suffixes cross-reference A and S
arguments of telic verbs. However, these markers can also cross-reference 0
arguments provided these do not conflict with the number hierarchy which can
be very broadly summarized as Pauc/PlA/O > Sg/DualA/O; that is paucal or
plural number 0 arguments can take precedence in the number suffix slot over
singular or dual A arguments. In other words, we find examples of Pauc/PlO
animates being marked by suffixes when there 'are 5~/D~l A an;mates:

' ...They (all) spoke Meryam; they (a few of them) then asked Abob and

(DualO>non SingularA)
Several possibilities can be suggested to account for these. This use may
reflect changes happening in the language such as that documented by
McConvell (1983; 26) who notes that there is 'loss of the trial/plural number
distinction intransitives' amongst speakers under about forty years old and so,
the number hierarchy is sometimes not applied. (This is less likely to be the
reason given that both of these utterances were by speakers in their fifties and
above.) It may be that such features are more sensitive to pragmatic features or
that indefiniteness in number for A is tolerated when its number and identity
have been clearly established elsewhere. A larger corpus of data monitoring these
factors would be desirable.
In addition, the number hierarchy needs to be explored with respect to ditransitive verbs where there are potentially two O's competing for cross-reference
marking in the suffix slot. It can be tentatively stated that when this is the case,
the animate 0 will take precedence over the inanimate 0:
(3.218) peybri legize komet le
nam nakwarda
name person-PIA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, a turtle.'
(The above example is interesting as it also illustrates how overt lexical number
marking for A will permit the cross-reference marking on the verb to include
number of A and 0.)
Although the hierarchy for animates over inanimates sugges1sa loss of
information for number of 0, the reader is reminded that forms of the verb roots
themselves often carry such information:133(3.219) peybri legize komet le
nam n(a)- ayswerda
name person-PlA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Pauc/PlO-PiPl
'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, turtles.'
Problems and Semantic Motivation for Conjugations 1. and 2.
The particular type of cross-reference marking used (i.e. from type 1. or type
2.) may also be carrying information about the 0 arguments. At first glance, the
different types appear totally arbitrary carrying no number information as
evidenced by the fact that both can occur with intransitive telic verbs:
e.g. bayter 'sink'
---> baytr-i 'SgS sink Pf';
ekyam 'get up'
---> ekyam-da(ri) 'SgS get up Pf';
---> bakyam-i 'PIS get up Pf';
bakyamu 'Sg/DualS go'
---> bakyamu-da(ri) 'SgS go Pf';
bakyaw 'Pauc/PlS go'
---> bakyaw-da 'PIS go Pf'.
Similarly, both types can occur with transitive telic verbs:
e.g. ero 'eat'
---> irw-i 'SgA eat Pf';
etomer 'show Sg/DualO' ---> etome-da(ri) 'SgS show Sg/DualO Pf'.
erap 'buy Pauc/PlO'
---> erap-i 'SgA buy PIO Pf';
---> erap-da 'PIA buy PIO Pf';
There is evidence, however, that at least in some cases, the inflections are
not arbitrary, but meaningful as they contrast with one another, within a single
verbal paradigm. With a couple of transitive verbs, the morphemes from
conjugation 1. -dari, -daryey, etc. always refer to singular or dual 0 arguments
(contrasting these with morphemes from conjugation 2. -i, -iyey, etc. which do
not refer to singular or dual 0 arguments). For example, the verb emarik 'send':
(3.220) ka
able netat zyawali emarik-dari
lSgA Det one bookO send- PfSg
'I sent the one book.'
(3.221) ka able zyawali emark-i
1SgA Det bookO send- Pf
'I sent the letters.'
(3.222) ka
wali
itrumda
1SgA clothingO take down-PfSg
'I took down my dress.'
(3.223) ka
kara
wali
itrumi
1SgA 1SgGen clothingO take down-Pf
'I took down my clothes.'
However, whilst there are only a few of these transitive verbs marking the
number of 0 arguments explicitly by contrasting conjugation markers 1. and 2,
there are many transitive verbs with related root forms where conjugation type1341, i.e. -dari, -daryey, etc, occurs consistently with singular I dualO. Here are a few
examples to illustrate:
irmida(ri)
(<irmi)
(3.224) ka netat pil
lSgA one <Eng swallow Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I swallowed the pill.'
(<irim)
i(3.225) ka pil irmlSgA <Eng swallow Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I swallowed the pills.'
(3.226) ka te
dimida(ri)
(<dimi)
lSgA doorO close Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I closed the door.'
dimi
(3.227) ka te
(<dim)
lSgA doorO close Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I closed the doors.'
erapeyda(ri)
(3.228) ka netat lu
(<erapey)
lSgA one thingO buy Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I bought one thing.'
(<erap)
(3.229) ka lu
erapi
lSgA thingO buy Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I bought things.'
Thus, there is evidence demonstrating a relation between singular I dualO
and verb markers from conjugation 1. Nonetheless, there remains a large corpus
of verbs where the claim is not borne out. Intransitive verbs cannot be carrying
information about the number of 0 as they do not have an 0 argument.
Similarly, there are transitive verbs which can only carry markers from
conjugation type 2, irrespective of the number of 0 involved. The following two
examples illustrate an intransitive and transitive verb from conjugation type 2:
(3.230) newr i
izw- i
(<i ezo)
girlS tear shed-Pf
'The girl cried.'
(<ewer)
(3.231) ka papek iwr- i
lSgA matO weave-Pf
'I wove a mat.'
The generalization can be formulated as follows: Only those verbs from
conjugation 1. express overtly singular/dual number for A or S through their
conjugation markers, i.e. through their morphology (and possibly through their
verb root form). Verbs from conjugation 2. generally have the same lexical root
for all numbers. Thus:
(<ezo)
ba- zw- i
(3.232) newr i
girlS tear PIS-shed-Pf
'The girls cried.'","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"94The distinction between the transitive verb with the A argument omitted
and a de-transitivised verb is presumably determined by, and sensitive to,
pragmatic features such as whether the speaker wants to be explicit or not about
the participation of an A. It may also be sensitive to the degree of control or
volition involved in the event. However, this area remains unexplored in the
present study and awaits further research.
3.6Genitive Marker For 3rd Person.
The morphemed- is sometimes optionally prefixed to intransitive and
transitive verbs beginning with a vowel to indicate agreement with the possessor
of an 0 argument or of a nominal in a complex verb phrase. It also
disambiguates the possessor as it indicates that it is not co-referent with the A or
S:
(3.49) koskir
abra
nesur desoda
(married) females 3SgGen lavalava 3Gen-wrap around-PfSg
'The woman wrapped his lavalava around herself.'
(3.50) able newr
yaba
mir diga- Ii
Det (unmarried) females 3n SgGen word 3Gen-talk-Prlmpf
'The girl talks their language.'
(3.51) ka kara

lSgA lSgGen child- Gen tearO 3Gen-hear-Pf
'I heard my child's tears.'
(3.52) e
abra werem disi
3SgA 3Gen childO 3Gen-give birth to Pauc/PlO-Pf
'She gave birth to his children.'
Contrast the following two examples where in 3.53, the genitive marker is
present on the verb to indicate that the possessor of the 0 argument is not coreferent with the A argument and in 3.54, the genitive marker is absent from the
verb as the possessor of the 0 argument is co-referent with the A argument:
(3.53) Lez-ide able aw kimyarira imus ditw- i abgerger-ge
L.- A Det big married male-Gen beardO 3Gen-shave-Pf former-day- Loe
'Les shaved off the old man's beard yesterday.'
(3.54) Lez-ide tabara imus itw- i Sabad-ge
L.- A 3Gen beardO shave-Pf <Eng- Loe
'Les shaved his beard off on Sunday.'
*Les shaved someone else's beard.'
(When the verb root commences with a consonant, it is not possible to show the
agreement or disambiguate the possessor of 0 from the A argument.)
The morpheme is restricted to 3rd person (pro)nominals as evidenced by
the unacceptability of agreement with 1st or 2nd person possessor arguments:95(3.55)*ka kara werem d- asri
3Gen
'I heard my child.'
(3.56) *ka mara werem d- asri
3Gen
'I heard your child.'
There are a few examples where the marker is used with an intransitive
simple verb to indicate agreement with the possessor of an S argument although
this seem to be a fairly marginal use since several speakers consider it
unacceptable:
(3.57) ?abra
ama
dewmi- da
3SgGen motherS 3Gen-n PIS die-PfSg
'Her mother is dead.'
Verbal Deictic Marker.
The deictic morpheme ta- is marked on the verb to indicate that the event
happens at a distance away from the speaker or that the event happens towards
the speaker. It indirectly serves to distinguish between verbs of motion and verbs
of location. To appreciate this distinction, consider the following examples
contrastive in their direction:
(3.58) ma ta- bakyamu- o,
ge ikedio
2SgS Deix-Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3, Deix put down Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Come, put it down here.'
*ma ta-bakyamu, ge t-ikedi
(3.59) ma bakyamu- o,
ge tikedio
2SgS Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3, Deix Deix-put down Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Go, put it down there.'
vma bakyamu, ge ikedi
In 3.58, the deictic marker on the verb of motion indicates movement
towards the speaker and its absence on the verb of location indicates that the
event happens close to the speaker. (Note that it is ungrammatical to use the
deictic on a verb of location to indicate close proximity.) In 3.59, the absence of
the deictic marker on the verb of motion indicates that the event happens
moving away from the speaker and its presence on the verb of location indicates
that the event happens at a distance away from the speaker. (It is acceptable to
have the deictic marker absent on both and this would indicate that the event is
not relative in distance to the speech act place nor related to the location of the
speaker.) In summary, the deictic marker interacts with the semantics of the verb
to specify whether the event is moving towards the speaker or whether the event
is happening away from the speaker.","[105, 106, 107]"
"Comparison with the Genitive Construction.
Anderson (1985; 185) claims that the genitive case when marked on the
possessor 'really expresses the fact that one noun is subordinate to and a modifier
of another'. This is verified in Meryam Mir where the possessor acts as a66modifier to the head. Many of the nominal compounds encountered can be
paraphrased by a genitive construction:
(2.235) kaba- (ra) lam
banana- Gen leaf
'banana leaf'
(ira) kok
(2.236) tag
hand,arm- Gen joint
'elbow'
(ra) mir
(2.237) koleEuropean-Gen word
'English'
Whilst Anderson's claim captures the structural difference between a
genitive construction (being subordinate) and a compound, what of the the
semantic difference? The choice of one particular construction over another is
determined by whether it is new information or not, with the genitive being used
for new information:
(2.238) .. .lam abra, kaba- ra lam (dike),
leaf 3SgGen banana-Gen leaf n PIS be(name)
kaba lam tiri0,
tays0
banana leaf Deix-cut Pauc/Pl0-Fut2/3 Deix-carry Pauc/Pl0-Fut2/3
' ... its leaves, the banana tree's leaves, cut the banana leaves, bring them .. .'
(How to make damper, p220, section9)
In other cases, compound nominals cannot be paraphrased by a genitive
construction as it will yield an unacceptable phrase or signal a change in the
meaning:
(2.239) *poni-ra wer
eye- Gen star,egg
ira kimyar
(2.240) newr(unmarried) female-Gen (married)male
'daughter's husband'
as opposed to:
newr-kimyar
'unmarried sister-in-law'
Nonetheless, a close relationship does exist between compounds and the
genitive construction. This may be the result of the restriction on the genitive
case when another case marker follows within the same phrase causing many
juxtaposed nominals to co-occur.
The possessor can be modified in a genitive construction whereas only the
head noun (or it could be the whole compound) can be modified with a syntactic
compound:67(2.241) aw enew
tarn
big wongai tree branch
'a big wongai branch'
(2.242) aw enew-ra tarn
gen
'branch of the big wongai tree'
On the basis of this, one can hypothesize that the genitive construction
represents a looser syntactic construction derived from a syntactic process
whereas nominal compounds represent a tighter syntactic construction derived
from a morphological process.

'aeroplane'.)

There are also morphophonological alternations:
-i -> -y I V+ ex. Selayna-y 'Selaina (0)'
-0 I y + ex. Pomoy-0 'Pomoy (O)'
ex. Kinor-i 'Kinor (0)'
-i I elsewhere
4.
The -e case inflection is also used with common nouns to mark both the S
of an intransitive verb and the 0 of a transitive verb, i.e. an absolutive case
pattern:
(2.15) able aw le0 ab- i
Det big person-S fall-Pf
'The old man fell.'
(2.16) able kebi leiut aw le0 eparsi-da
Det little person-SgA big person-0 hitPfSg
'The youth punched the old man.'
5.
The locative case inflection (-ge I -idoge) is used to mark the place where
the event occurs or the end point of a verb of motion:
(2.17) ka meta- ge b- aClari
lSgS house-Loe Intr-put in Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I entered into the house.'
(2.18) e
lewer t- ero-li
taba uteb- ge
3SgA foodO Deix-eat-Prlmpf 3Gen place-Loe
'He is eating at his place.'
The form -idoge is used to mark the Locative case with proper nouns:
(2.19) Lez-idoge
L.- Loe
'at Les""
*Lez-ge
It can also be used with a proper noun to indicate the possessor's place, i.e.
the person's place at which the event occurs:
(2.20) ka ut
eydida Eydyana-ydoge
lSgS sleepN. n PIS lie down-PfSg E.Loe
'I slept at Eidiana's place.'
(The example given above might also be possible to interpret with a comitative
meaning although this has to be checked.)34The locative case is also used with a secondary meaning with animate
nouns to convey the meaning of accompaniment, i.e. a comitative meaning:
(2.21) e
abi
kimyarge digm-i pamas-em
3SgS 3SgGen married male-Loe walk-Pf shop- All
'She walked with her husband to the shops.'
There is a syntactic restriction in that there cannot be two locative
arguments used in a single clause. Contrast the previous example (2.21) in which
the allative case is used for the second peripheral argument with the following
ungrammatical example (2.22) where two locative arguments occur:
(2.22) *e abi kimyar-ge digmi pamas-ge
LoeThe restriction on two locative phrases co-occurring is resolved by either
the phrase referring to a place being marked with the allative case or the animate
noun being marked with the associative case:
(2.23) wi
kimyarkem namiredi
able uteb- ge
3n SgS married male-Ass 3n SgS-n PIS be sitting-Prlmpf Det place-Loe
/
'The two of them, she along with her husband. are sitting at that place.'
There is a correlation between the locative case, used with animate nouns
to mark accompaniment with verbs of motion, and the associative case, used with
animate nouns to mark accompaniment with verbs of non-motion.
The locative case can sometimes be used as a local (syntactic?) argument
reflecting cultural mores or habits. Consider the verb ispi(r) 'marry, hide' tr.vb.
and espi(r) intr.vb.:
(2.24) kimyaride abi ispi- da
married male-A 3Sg0 marry-PfSg
'The man married her.'
Contrast with the following:
(2.25) koskir mayk- e espi- da
womans widower-Loe marry-PfSg
'The woman married the widower.'
In the first example, the man is the A argument marked by the ergative
case whilst in the second example, the woman is the S argument marked by the
absolutive case. The widower whom she is marrying is marked by the locative
case indicating that it is a peripheral argument and also conveys that the place she
will live henceforth will be her husband's abode. (The locative case does not refer
to the place where the marriage ceremony was held.)
The locative case is used to mark the physical or emotional state of the
experiencer:
(2.26) e

'He is thirsty.'","[44, 45, 46]"

These are the only examples collected of this type suggesting a semiproductive process. It could be more appropriate to list them directly in the
lexicon as compound lexemes.
Comparison with Adjectives.
It was mentioned in the introduction that compounds, be they listed as
lexemes or produced through a productive process, share comparable and
diverging features with adjectives.
Similarities between these two groups have been alluded to above. It was
seen that the compound types frequently exhibit the pattern in which Nl
provides more information about N2. Adjectives which precede the noun they
modify fulfil a similar function because they too provide additional information
about the referent of the noun. In formal terms, the Nl of a compound and
adjectives both precede the head noun and both fulfil a modifier-type function.
However, most adjectives are derived from nouns by a process of
reduplication whereas nouns in a compound structure do not undergo such a
derivational process (see the section on Adjectives, p75).
There are a number of examples in the data which contrast a modifying
noun and a modifying adjective. Consider:
(2.226) ni

(i.e. one which has been lying on the ground for several days)
Semantic differences between the two types are not easily captured.
Wierzbicka (1988) when discussing differences between nouns and adjectives
makes the claim that nouns 'identify a certain kind of person, a kind of thing, a
kind of animal (Ibid; 469) ...endowed with certain properties; whereas adjectives
designate properties as such (and more specifically what is seen as) a single
property' (Ibid; 472). Whilst her explanation has been formulated to capture
differences between independent nouns and adjectives, it does seem that her
comments are pertinent to the differences between a modifying noun in a
compound and an adjective. In compounds, the first noun often provides
information which identifies the kind of referent it is, whereas adjectives provide
information concerning a particular property of the referent.
Givon (1984; 51) in his account of the differences between independent
nouns and adjectives provides a semantic explanation which seems to partly
capture the difference between modifying nouns and adjectives. His claim is that
nouns refer to the most stable conditions, adjectives to intermediate states (as
opposed to verbs which are events of most rapid change). With compounds, the
modifying noun often refers to a permanent and inherent quality of the head
noun, whereas with adjectives, it is often an impermanent quality and often the
result of a process.
Neither approach satisfactorily distinguishes between modifying nouns
and adjectives. However, neither Wierzbicka nor Givon formulated their ideas
in order to account for modifying nouns although features such as 'the kind of
thing' and 'permanence' capture some of the differences. A language which
heavily exploits such a distinction can contribute in refining and modelling these
semantic claims.

As the reader may have noted from the examples cited above, there is a
high correlation of telic verbs, both transitive and intransitive, whose roots or
stems begin with /e/. It may be that verbs have phonotactic restrictions in their
occurrence in having to commence with (d)V. As a consequence of this
restriction, verbs that begin with a non-permissible consonant are prefixed with
the formative I e/.
The plural intransitive telic prefix ba- and the formative e- are mutually
exclusive, e.g. ewrni 'n PIS die' and ba-wrn 'PIS die'. Similarly, the intransitiviser
ba- and the formative e- are mutually exclusive, e.g. erap 'break' and ba-rap 'be

It is unclear what the affix marker -dar- means. It may be from the paucal
number suffix or from an old auxiliary. In some cases, it appears completely
lexicalised to the meaning of the verb, e.g. er-(dar-) 'watch' where all verbal
inflected forms occur with the affix -dar-: a-r-dar-e Fut1, er-dar-i Pf, er-dar-iyey
PfDual, er-dar-dare P£Pauc, er-dar-da P£Pl, but consider its nominalised form: irem 'to watch' (lit: see-All). In some cases, it is only found on the paucal/plural
forms of verbs, e.g. upi diti 'help Sg/DualO', upi diti-dar- 'help Pauc/PlO', but
consider the nominalised form: upi a-ti-dar-em 'to help'. In some cases, it occurs
optionally with nonpresent durative inflections, e.g. ewsmer 'Sg/DualS come
out', ewsme-dar-er - ewsmer-er n Prlmpf, but ewsme-li Prlmpf, *ewsme-da(r)-li,
e~g. ekyam 'wake up', ba-kyam-er - ba-kyam-dar-er PIS n Prlmpf:

In some cases, it is obligatorily suffixed with all durative type inflections:
e.g. b-aw 'Sg/DualS go in', b-a-da(r)-li Prlmpf, *ba-li, b-a-dar-er n Prlmpf, *ba-r-er;
mir atrum 'suggest Sg/DualO', atrum-da(r)-li PrlmpfSg, *atrum-li.
Whilst it is not possible to predict when it will occur, it is possible to see a
recurrent meaning associated with the suffix, namely that all events are nonpunctiliar as they are either extended in time, repeated several times or over a
long time period. It may be that it is historically derived from a non-punctiliar
derivational morpheme.

There are two possible interpretations for this data. One can either regard
the inflected nominal as the head with the preposed nominal acting like a
modifier, or one could regard the whole phrase as a complex phrase with the case
suffixed to the postposition.
Absent from the noun complex structure presented above is the
phenomenon of compounds which behave like a single complex head noun.
There is no syntactic dependency between the two nouns since modifiers affect
both parts of a complex head noun:

"Bartos proposes 3 different allophones for velar stops that are produced

However, the current corpus of data does not reveal any significant differences in
the point of articulation of these stops. There may be slight fronting of the velar

sound that can occur upon the stop's release. However, the change at the point

Comments.
The reader should note that the allophones along with their
environments are based on a sample of speech of generally older, possibly more
conservative speakers whilst others appear to use, to a greater degree, the8continuant. (This has been confirmed by Rigsby p.c. having worked with an
informant who only used the continuant). No taped or elicited material has been
collected for specifically documenting this and comments are based on casual
observation. It is at least suggestive, however, that the variation between the tap
and continuant is the result of diachronic change reflected in a synchronic study.
This may be an influence from English.
The change may be as follows. For some speakers, the tap has weakened to
a continuant when preceded by a consonant that occurs at the same point of
articulation,. ie.an alveolar. Rather than producing the alveolar sound then
bringing the tongue back to the same place of articulation for the tap, it is easier
and faster to weaken the tap to an approximant. The change, which may have
started only in these typesof clusters)
, is spreading F~.~ some conservative
itha5 $Cfeo4
..
speaker~~to most non-alveolar clusters but not to peripheral voiced oral stops for
some reason. Thus in the data collected, there are no examples of peripheral
voiced stops followed by a continuant:
detagri 'say Pf'
?detag..Ii
abr a '3SgGen'
?ab.la
Elsewhere (word finally and in non-clusters), the tap still occurs. However,
for
other speakers, the continuant is being used more and more. The
diachronic change can be very tentatively schematised as follows:
(i) r I everywhere
(ii) r I C [peripheral voiced oral stop] (iii) ..I IC [alveolar] (iv) .i I c (v) ..I/ everywhere
The arrows are an attempt to show a dynamic process of change
rather than a static state. More conservative speakers move down the scale while
less conservative speakers move up the scale. The former will call the language
Meryam Mir and the latter will call it Me..tyam Mi.I.
The distinction between a trill versus a tap may be erroneous as the rhotic
is never really trilled. What occurs in most instances is a tap or a continuant. It
does appear that in words ending in a rhotic such as berder 'mud', the sound
produced is often a tap followed by a voiceless alveolar fricative whereby the
tongue is not actually hitting the roof of the mouth but the air is passing through
in a series of bursts suggestive that the speaker is at least approximating to a trill.
On the other hand, this may be the result of the high pitch accent occurring on
that syllable and what is being heard is air turbulence produced by a large amount
of energy. In words where the rhotic occurs in non-final position, the sound
produced is a tap or a continuant and elsewhere, it may be a tap or trill.","[18, 19, 20]"

What has been presented above suggests that some verbs have forms from
each conjugation type to convey the number of 0 and that there is a correlation
between conjugation type 1. and overt marking of singular/dual S/O. However,
there are verbs which have forms from each conjugation type and these are
neither semantically nor morphologically motivated. In some cases, the
alternation appears to be phonologically motivated: verb roots from conjugation
2. ending in /r/ are suffixed with paucal forms from conjugation 1, e.g. dasmer
'see' ---> dasmer-i Pf---> dasmer-dare PfPauc, *dasmer-idare; erdar 'watch' --->
erdar-i Pf--> erdar-dare PfPauc, *erdar-idare. In other cases, there is no
phonological environment for predicting the form and these must be considered
exceptions: a verb root from conjugation 2. such as esi 'bang against the waves'
(example from McConvell (1983; 17) has the dual form from conjugation 1.
suffixed, e.g. esi-0 Fut2/3, esi-lam Fut2/3Dual. Many verbs which have been
intransitivised, have forms from each conjugation type, e.g. ba-dmirik 'run
away' (<Intr-chase away) ---> badmirik-da Pf--> badmirik-daryey PfDual -->
badmirk-idere PfPauc, *badmirikdere; ba-rap 'be broken' (<Intr-break) --> barapda Pf--> barap-iyey PfDual, *barap-daryey; ba-rbor 'be broken by tearing' (<Intrthrow?) --> barbor-da Pf--> barbor-iyey PfDual, *barbor-daryey. Given that
inflections from conjugation 1. end predominantly in a consonant whilst those
from conjugation 2. end predominantly with a vowel, these may be
phonologically rather than semantically motivated. Furthermore, note that
when there are related root forms for different number, it is the paucal/plural
forms that often end with a consonant and the singular I dual forms which end in
a vowel. It may be the language is in a process of change and/or speakers are
regularizing the processes although exceptions remain. Some evidence in
support of this latter claim is provided by one speaker who gives 'earlier' forms
of the language: e.g. barap-da 'be broken Pf', older form barapi. Another
hypothesis is that some forms only are semantically motivated whilst others are
morphologically motivated.
Person Markers for S and A.
In the future, tense is shown partly by suffixes whose forms are determined
by the person and partly by the prefixes na- (a-) for 1st person and wa- for 3rd
person. As the prefixes' forms are determined by person, they can be regarded as
portmanteau affixes carrying information about tense and person. Some
examples follow:136(3.234) ka abi a- kware
lSgA 3Sg0 Futl-give Sg/DualO-Futl
'I will give (it) to him.'
(3.235) e
abi wa- ykwar0
3SgA 3Sg0 Fut3-give Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'He will give (it) to him.'
Contrast these examples with the one below where the 2nd person is used
and there is no prefix. No zero morpheme is hypothesized for the underlying
form as all nonfuture tenses would have zero marking in the prefix position, a
fact that would merely obscure the data:
(3.236) ma abi ikwar0
2SgA 3Sg0 give Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Give (it) to him.'
Recall that there are allomorphic distinctions in the future prefix forms
that are based on the transitivity of the verb. With future marking for 3rd
person, a transitive verb's front vowel whether it is carrying the main accent or
not, is reduced to a glide before prefixation whereas an intransitive verb's front
unaccented vowel is not. With future marking for 1st person, the morpheme is
na- for intransitive verbs and -a- for transitive verbs. (See the section on the
morphemes' allomorphs, plll.) Thus, the contrast in the morphemes' forms is
established by the verb's transitivity:

These examples are illustrative for another reason. The two
morphological categories do not coincide exactly with the semantic categories that
were postulated. Thus, the verb ikasir 'be going along' and the verb esk (< -kos)
'be flowing' are not atelic stative verbs yet behave morphologically with verbs of
this category. There are two possible explanations for these facts. One
explanation is that verbs which are atelic stative in one language such as in
English need not be so in another language such as Meryam Mir. An alternative
explanation is that these categories are essentially morphological categories
which cannot be fully specified on a semantic basis.
3.3Transitive and Intransitive Verbs.
It has been established that a distinction needs to be drawn between atelic
stative and telic active verbs partly on the basis of their morphology and partly on
the basis of semantic criterion. What of the distinction between transitive and
intransitive verbs?
On the basis of arguments which the verbs select, a distinction can be
drawn between transitive and intransitive verbs as the nominals bear A, S or 0
case marking. However, the verbal morphology itself does not cross-reference
strictly on a ergative-absolutive basis nor on a nominative-accusative basis but
rather displays features of both types and some verbs can even employ either type. or
both typesof cross-reference marking.
Consider first a nominative-accusative type cross-reference marking
system. With atelic stative verbs (which are all intransitive verbs), number and,
to some degree, person of the S argument, are marked by means of prefixing:
(3.20) kara
sospan pe da-rakmerkedi
lSgGen <EngS Deix I -3n SgS-1 Sg/DualS be resting upon-Pr
urmeme-ge
fireplace- Loe
'My two saucepans are resting upon the stove.'
Similarly, 0 arguments of transitive verbs are cross-referenced on the verb
by means of prefixing:
(3.21) ka
sospan da-rakmerikda(ri) urmeme-ge
lSgA <EngO I -3n Sg0-1 put resting Sg/DualO upon-PfSg fireplace-Loe
'I put the two saucepans resting upon the stove.'
It should be noted that under certain conditions, namely with the number
hierarchy, the 0 can be cross-referenced for number in the suffix position but86there is specification in the prefix position (at least for 3rd person and for some
verbs with 1/2nd person):
(3.22) ka
yabi da-ratagr-idare
1SgA 3n SgO I -3n Sg0-1 tell- Pauc
'I told them (few).'
With telic active verbs involving intransitive verbs, plural number of the
S argument can be cross-referenced by a prefix:
(3.23) wi
ba- mri
3n SgS PIS-Pauc/PIS sit down-Pf
'They all sat down.'
However, for all other numbers (including plural for some verbs), the S
argument is cross-referenced by a suffix:
(3.24) ki
bakyamu- daryey
ln SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'We two (excl) went.'
(3.25) ki
bakyawda
ln SgExclS Pauc/PIS go-PEPI
'We all went.'
Similarly, with telic active verbs involving transitive events, the A
argument is cross-referenced for number by means of a suffix:
(3.26) ki
keriba
lewer erapeydaryey
ln SgExclA ln SgExclGen foodO buy Sg/DualO-PfDual
'We two (excl) bought our food.'
Thus, a correlation can be noted between the cross-reference markers and
the transitivity and type of verb. Prefixes are used for S of atelic stative verbs, 0
arguments and for some plural S of telic active intransitive verbs. Suffixes are
used for A or S arguments of telic active verbs. The first type of cross-referencing
is reminiscent of an absolutive case pattern with Sand 0 receiving the same
marking. The second type of cross-referencing is reminiscent of a nominative
case pattern with Sand A receiving the same marking. Both of these represent
general patterns and within them, the reader should be aware that there are
deviations, i.e. the 0 argument can be marked by a suffix.
McConvell in his study (1983; 44-45) on ergative and verb agreement
reaches a similar conclusion using different but related evidence. His argument
is that the suffix slot on the verb is neither strictly 'ergative' nor 'accusative' as A,
S and 0 arguments can be cross-referenced in this position. The prefix slot,
however, is clearly 'ergative' in its operation, only being filled by 0 arguments or
by A/S 1st or 3rd person future markers (although he did not have examples of
atelic stative verbs which do have S arguments cross-referenced in the prefix slot
irrespective of tense).","[96, 97, 98]"

Number alternations in verb forms appear to follow an ergative-absolutive
pattern in that it is overwhelmingly the number of 0 arguments of transitive
verbs and the number of S arguments of intransitive verbs which determine the
form of the verb root. For example: akaweret 'Sg/DualS climb onto', etir
'Pauc/PlS climb onto' and ikaweret 'load onto Sg/DualO', itir 'load onto
Pauc/PlO'.
However, there are verb root forms where the number alternations are not
determined by a particular argument but rather by the number of arguments
irrespective of whether they are A or 0 with paucal/plural arguments taking
precedence over singular I dual. For example, consider the related verb roots
etomeret 'show Pauc/PlA or O' and etomer 'show Sg/DualA and O':
(3.6)

Similarly, consider the three related verb roots dipigemer 'Sg/DualA turn

Verb Types: Atelic Stative and Telic Active.
There are two distinct verb types in the language distinguished by their
different morphological markers. The first group of verbs takes temporal suffixes
which distinguish present (-(re)di/-o) from nonpresent (-(re)der/-o). The second
group of verbs takes temporal/ aspectual suffixes which distinguish between
(non)present imperfective (-li/-eyey /-le/-eda; -er/-ley /-le/-lare) and perfective
(such as the forms -i/-iyey /-idare/-da). (The differences in forms correspond
roughly to different number marking and there is no temporal/ aspectual
marking for some numbers. See the section on Temporal/ Aspectual/
Mood/Number markers 3.8.1 p99 for more details.)
As is apparent from the markers, the first group does not distinguish
perfective from imperfective whereas the second group does. This difference
reflects to some degree semantic categories corresponding to atelic stative verbs3.284for one group and to telic active verbs for the other. Consider for example the
following two related intransitive verbs emri 'sit down' (telic active) and imi 'be
sitting' (atelic stative):
(3.15) ki
dimiredi
1n SgExclS 1/2Dual/PaucS-Sg/DualS be sitting-Pr
'We (2excl) are sitting.'
(3.16) ki
emridaryey
1n SgExclS n PIS sit down-PfDual
'We two (excl) sat down.'
The two examples given above show that number cross-referencing differs
depending on whether it is an atelic stative or telic active verb. The former
category, i.e. atelic statives (3.15), cross-references by means of prefixes equivalent
to those used for 0. The latter category, i.e. telic &;¢.tives (3.16), cross-references by
means of suffixes equivalent to those used predominantly for A. Compare the
cross-reference marking with intransitive verbs to the following transitive verb
imri 'seat someone' (3.17), where the person and number of 0 is marked with a
prefix d- and the number of A is marked with a suffix -daryey:
(3.17) ki
wabi dimri-daryey
1n SgExclA 2Sg01/2n SgO-sit- PfDual
'We two sat you(2) down.'
Compare this example with those of intransitive verbs. The atelic stative
verb's cross-reference marker for S matches that of the transitive verb's 0 crossreference marker, i.e. a prefix, and the telic active verb's cross-reference marker
for S matches that of the transitive verb's A cross-reference marker, i.e. a suffix.
Although the markers do not always correlate in such a neat one to one
correspondance, there are instances where they do.
The temptation is to consider the two verb types, namely the atelic stative
and telic active, as derivations of each other. Such an approach would be
inappropriate as not all verbs have an active and stative form. For example, the
verb ikasir 'be going along' and the verb esk (< Vkos) 'be flowing' only have
stative forms:
(3.18) e
edi
ikaser3SgS be going along-Pr
'He is going along.'
*e ikaser-da
Pf
*e ikasr-i
Pf
(3.19) e eskedi

'It is flowing.'","[94, 95, 96]"
"1845.2.1 Equational type Clauses.
Within equational type clauses, one can include clauses such as equational,
locational, descriptive, existential and proprietive. In fact, the same verbs can be
used for all these types. They can be distinguished from each other semantically.
locational:
(5.16) e
[Caims-ge daIi]
Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
3SgS C.'He is in Cairns.'
descriptive:
(5.17) ka [gim+gim n(a)aIi]
1SgS ill Adj

'I am sick.'
(5.18) ma nole [dorge-kak (ma) n(a)aIi]
2SgS Neg work- Priv 2SgS 1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'You are without work.'
proprietive:
(5.19) abra

3SgGen two feetS I -3n SgS-1 n PIS be(thing)
'It has two feet.'
(5.20) kara
nole bakir- kak nagri
1SgGen Neg stone-Priv 3n SgS-PlS be(thing)
'I do not have money.'
existential:
(5.21) nole [abit-kak irdi
] meta- ge
Neg 3Sg-Priv n PIS be(place,time) house-Loe
'He is not there, at home.' (lit: It is without him at home.'(?))
equational (i.e. NP1 has the same referent as NP2):
(5.22) e
[kara
newr
daIi]
3SgS 1SgGen (unmarried)femaleS n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'She is my daughter.'
Equational clauses can be distinguished from other types in being able to
have the topic deleted since it is co-referential with the comment:
(5.23) kara
berbet daIi
1SgGen sibling n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'(He) is my brother.'
Deletion of topics with locational, descriptive and proprietive sentences is
either not possible or it will result in an existential meaning:
(5.24) *Cairns-ge da-li
'(He) is in Cairns.'","[195, 196]"
