As in 14-33, the Perfect form of tu(h)- expresses present existence. In a negative
sentence, when the Complement is followed by the negative particle toku and the
numeral noi 'alone/any' (cf. §8.2.2.1.1), the presence of the Perfect form of the verbtu(h)- is optional (cf. 14-106).

Note that both the copula verb tu(h)- and the existential verb tu(h)- 'to be' have
defective TAM paradigms. cf. Ch 15.",[437]

(5) ngo- 'to do' expresses immediate future (only with action and terminative transitive

DEFFUT + lngo-1 (PRES, PRESPROG, GEN.SS, GEN.DS)
That these verbs function as operators at nuclear level (cf. Foley and Olson 1985:
33-34), and not as proper verbs which coordinate or subordinate the preceding verbs,
is demonstrated by the facts that:
1) the aspectual verbs cannot take arguments of their own.
2) no morpheme can intervene between the aspectual verb and the preceding medial
verb or verb in Definite Future. In particular, the negative particle toku cannot
intervene between these two morphemes. In clause chaining, on the other hand,toku can intervene between the marked clause and the controlling clause, .and
negate only the controlling verb.

(VIII-46)9.3THE EMPHATIC SUFFIX /-ko/The emphatic suffix /-ko/ can be attached to any word except for interjections. It can
modify a particular word, phrase, clause or sentence. It singles out the element it is
attached to.
When it modifies a clause or a sentence, or a conjunction or a discourse marker, it
expresses the concessive meaning 'even, if only'. It can also mark two successive
clauses or sentences, with the meaning 'A, and also B'.
The suffix /-ko/ may be realised as -ngo under the environment specified in Rule 4-1.
e.g. ti-wori-ngo in 9-33. When this suffix is attached to personal pronouns, the article
and the demonstrative, the following changes occur:
( 1) The underlying short vowels of monosyllabic pronouns /ni/, fro/ and /pal are
realised as long vowels; but in the case of the article /ho - so/, the vowel may be
realised either short or long. -Ko is simply attached to the underlying forms of all the
other pronouns.
9-33/ni/ 'I' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> nii-ko
fro/ 'you.sg' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> roo-ko/pal 'who' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> paa-ko
/ho- so/ 'ART.M' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> ho(o)-ko- so(o)-ko
/noni/ 'we.exc' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> noni-ko
/nee/ 'we.inc' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> nee-ko
/reel 'you.nonsg' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> ree-ko(2) The /o/ of the suffix /-ko/ is realised as a long vowel for an extra emphasis, with the
article /tiil, and with lho-ko - so-ko/ which is the emphatic form of the article lho - so/.
(See §6.2.4 for the function of 1-ko/ when it is attached to the article. This lengthening
does not occur in the concessive or contrastive use of these words.)Chapter 92049-34/tii/ 'ART.F/DIMIDP' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> tii-koo- tii-ngoo
lho-ko- so-ko/ 'ART.M-EMPH' + 1-ko/ 'EMPH' -> ho-ko-koo-so-ko-koo
Note that the !of of the suffix /-ko/ is also realised as a long vowel after the locative
suffix /-koril, or after the local article in purposive case /ti-ko/.
The emphatic suffix /-ko/ is attached to:
( 1) the determiner (or the head, if without determiner) of an argument NP,
(2) an attribute in an NP,
(3) a verbal/nominal/adjectival predicate,
(4) an adverb,
(5) a discourse marker,
(6) the negator, or
(7) a conjunction.
Examples:

9-35jeewo?roo-kowoo-kipi-i=ta-na?howyou.sg-EMPHwhere-ERGgo.2S-PRESPROG-F'How? Which way are you (and not others) going?' (XIV-15)

attribute ti-wori 'that (human)' within the same NP:

"8.2.2.1.1The Free Form noiThe syntactic behaviour of noi is different from that of other numerals. In attribution, it usually occupies a post-head position, but not always, unlike other numerals
(cf. §10.3.3.4 and 10.3.4.2). It has special functions in negative sentences. It can
modify both countable and uncountable nouns, expressing ""indefiniteness"" in general.
There are gaps which neither of my main informants could fill. Especially the paradigms of those
numeral classifiers which are not often used in daily conversation are incomplete. See Table 8-2. They
must be filled by older speakers in the future. In my corpus of texts large numbers (such as year
numbers) are expressed by English numerals.",[208]

In some cases, the Continuous SS form of a dynamic action verb is used in affirmation
to describe the manner of an activity, rather than the activity itself:ngo- (middle) 'to be involved in an event' (3a):

The DS form of a dynamic action or tenninative verb, on the other hand, is used to
express the continuation of a state resulting from a completed event ( 15-143 - 15-145).
In negation, it expresses the state before the inception of the event ( 15-146).","[502, 503]"
"76Chapter 1Motuna. Both ofthem are in their forties. They speak English and Tok Pisin fluently,
and apart from these languages, Dora speaks her father's language Roviana (Austronesian) in the Solomon Islands, and Therese her first husband's language Tinputz
(Austronesian) in Bougainville. They also speak neighbouring Non-Austronesian
languages such as Nagovisi and Buin to some extent.
There are other texts by two elderly speakers, Sirou Korikee (female) and Puuwa
Paurarai (male) from Haarii village, which were recorded by Therese when she was
herself collecting narratives and accounts of Siwai tradition from old people.
In all, my main corpus consists of twenty-three texts, in total duration of 138
minutes. As mentioned in § 1.2, there is very little dialectal variation among these
texts. The texts (I), (VIII) and (XVII) are given in Appendix for illustration. This
grammar is inductively formulated by examining the language data in these texts.
In addition, I use three texts of the Pouko dialect obtained from Agnes Kennedy (in
her thirties) for supplement. The reason why I did not use these texts in the same way
as the main texts mentioned above is that the Pouko dialect is quite distinct from other
dialects (cf. §1.2). The former are also characterised by many more loanwords and
incomplete sentences than the latter.
There are four more recorded
texts.
Two of them are recorded from the telephone
.
.
conversation of Therese with another Motuna speaker. One is a free conversation
between Therese and her three daughters. And the last one is a personal history told by
a male speaker, Alex Dawuia (in his forties), from Mamangota village. All these texts
are characterised by loanwords from English and Tok Pisin, and loose conversational
style with lots of incomplete sentences. Sentences and vocabulary (especially loanwords) found in these texts are occasionally used to illustrate particular aspects of the
grammar.
Four short conversational texts, and a collection of 166 short sentences, written by
Dora Leslie, are also used to illustrate some grammatical points.
All the examples cited from the above-mentioned data are identified at the end of
English translation in brackets. For example, (XI-13) indicates that it is taken from the
thirteenth sentence of the text (XI). If there is no number in brackets, the given
example is from elicitation. All the elicited examples were checked carefully by the two
main informants. Gaps in some areas of grammar --- especially in the paradigms of
nouns, classifiers and verbs --- are checked through elicitation. They were also
checked carefully by my two main informants.
The main aim of this grammar is to present major characteristics of this language for
language typologists and linguists in general. It is not exhaustive, but it covers all the
grammatical aspects found in the narrative texts mentioned above. I give examples
quite generously whenever I discuss important grammatical P?ints. Sometimes theIntroduction7same examples are used in different chapters. Wherever it is relevant, the use of the
same example in different chapters is referred to in the text or in brackets after the data
identification number.
Some aspects of the grammar --- such as the paradigms of numeral classifiers, the
use of the agentless passive construction --- are incomplete. These areas of grammar,
as well as detailed analysis of complex sentences and discourse organisation, investigation for sociolinguistic variation and genetic relationship with neighbouring languages,
are left for further research.","[34, 35, 36]"
"Masayuki OnishiAcknowledgementsFirst of all, I would like to express my gratitude to three ladies, without whose
assistance this thesis would never have been completed.
Two of them come from Bougainville. Dora Leslie initiated me into her beautiful
language, taught me and answered my endless questions with utmost patience. Therese
Minitong Kemelfield told lots of interesting stories to me. Her fervent discussions on
Siwai culture were ever so inspiring. For both of them, the last four years must have
been the most dreadful time in their lives --- their mothers and other close relatives were
suffering from the political conflict on the island, and there was no way for them even
to communicate with their own people most of the time. In spite of this frustrating
situation, they never failed to address me with warmth in their hearts. All their family
members living in Australia have become very good friends of my family as well.
Ulrike Mosel, my supervisor in chair, assisted me to write the thesis from beginning
to end with meticulous care. Before starting my PhD, I was virtually a novice in
writing a grammar. I saw the last four years as my apprenticeship, and she was the
most worthy Meisterin. She taught me not only how to write a grammar, but also how
to enjoy writing a grammar. Her liberal and flexible way of thinking very often saved
me from mental exhaustion.
R.M.W. Dixon, my other supervisor, encouraged me to work on this interesting
language, and gave many important suggestions on every chapter of my thesis. I am
greatly indebted to him.
Two other Motuna speakers living in Australia --- Agnes Kennedy and Alex Dawuia
--- provided some language data and were very helpful during my field work. I am
grateful to both of them.
I owe a great deal to other researchers in the languages and cultures of Bougainville
people, especially to Douglas Oliver who worked on the Siwai culture, and to Conrad
and Phyllis Hurd who worked on the Nasioi language. Conrad Hurd kindly provided
me with some valuable data in Nasioi, and helped me getting unpublished materials
from the Summer Institute of Linguistics.
I am also grateful to the Australian National University and the Department of
Employment, Education and Training for the financial assistance provided through anANU PhD Scholarship and an Overseas Postgraduate Research Scholarship, respectively.
This thesis actually started when I took the ""Field Methods"" course conducted by
R.M.W. Dixon in the second semester of 1990. Dora was the informant in this course,
and there were nine other students--- Anna Scott, Hugh Sainty, Jason McDonald, John
Schooneveldt, Karen Gillespie, Peggy Daroesman, Ruth Chisholm, Tim Curnow, and
Xiaonong Zhu. I benefited enormously from their discussion on this language.
My other teachers and fellow students made helpful comments and suggestions on
different parts of my thesis at different times. Detailed comments were made by Phil
Rose, Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Tom Dutton on some of the chapters. Phil Rose,
in addition, gave me various technical advice on the phonetic analysis of my data during
the busiest time of his teaching. Tom Dutton, my advisor, also assisted me in some
technical matters. I am grateful to all of them.
I am a late comer in the arena of linguistics. Although I had long been interested in
·languages, I had never studied linguistics seriously until I came to Canberra in 1989.
In that year I was taught an introduction to linguistics and sociolinguistics by Elisabeth
Patz in the University of Canberra, as a TESOL student. Her excellent lectures determined the direction of my study. In the following year I was enrolled in the ANU, and
since then, I have had ample opportunities to investigate different areas of linguistics
with the assistance of teachers, fellow students and visitors. Among them were Anna
Wierzbicka, Phil Rose and Harold Koch, and my supervisors mentioned above. My
debt is to all the people I encountered in the course of my linguistic studies. This thesis
is in a way a summary of what I have learned from them in the last few years in
Canberra.
My final word of thanks is due to Ayuko, Takashi and our newly-born little Motona.
They created a joyful family environment which I regard as the most valuable thing in
my life. I could get myself refreshed whenever I spent time with them. Our second
son's name was taken from the language name ""Motuna"" with slight modification
according to Japanese phonology. His name will always remind me and my family of
the years we spent in Canberra, and of our special friendship with Motuna speakers.iiAbstractThis thesis is a descriptive grammar of Motuna, a Non-Austronesian language
spoken by several thousand people in the south-western part of Bougainville (called
Siwai), Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Buin Family of the Eastern Bougainville
stock, in the Bougainville Phylum. This grammar is based on the analysis of narrative
texts provided by four speakers of the standard Motuna.
Motuna is a both head and dependent marking agglutinative language with complex
morphology. Like most Non-Austronesian languages in Papua NewGuinea, it is verb
final, and has medial and non-medial verbal categories. In addition, verbs have basic
voice distinction between active and middle voices, and have extensive tense/aspect/mood categories. Nouns have six genders and are also classified by fifty-one
classifiers.
Chapter 1 discusses the typological characteristics, as well as the genetic relations
and dialectal variations of Motuna. It also briefly summarises previous work done on
this language, and provides the scope and data base of this thesis.
Chapter 2 deals with phonetics, phonology and orthography. It includes an introduction to morphophonemics which will be discussed fully in later chapters, particularly in
Chapter 4 (nouns), Chapter 8 (classifiers, numerals and the 'all' quantifier), and
Chapter 13 (verbal morphology).
Chapter 3 outlines the word-classes and the clausal syntax of this language. Chapters 4 - 9 deal with the mopho-syntax of all the word classes except for verbs, participles and verbal nouns. Chapter 10 discusses the internal structure of the NP, and
Chapter 11 possessive, kinship and other constructions.
Chapter 12 outlines the morpho-syntax of verbs. I give a gist of verbal morphology
in this chapter, so that readers may skip Chapter 13 which is a lengthy discussion of
complicated verbal morphology. Chapter 14 discusses valency of verbs including
valency-changing derivations (stimulative, causative, applicative and reciprocal).
Chapter 15 deals with tense/aspect/mood. Chapter 16 deals with two word classes
derived from verbs .,.-- verbal nouns and participles.
Chapter 17 discusses the interclausal relations in Motuna, mainly chaining of medial
verbs and relative clauses.
Finally, three narative texts of this language are provided in Appendix.iiiContents

switch-reference markings. I will discuss the paradigm of S0 verbs ( § 13 .2.1), SA
verbs (§13.2.2), irregular verbs (§13.2.3), and middle verbs (§13.2.4) in tum. In
§ 13.2.5, the cross-referencing markings of intransitive verbs of all types are
summarised.
(2) In §13.3, the paradigms of transitive verbs are discussed and summarised in the

In 15-152a and b, the verb unu-ko-ng is used as a proper verb. It takes a peripheral
argument noni-nno. Furthermore, in 15-152a, the negative particle toku can intervene
between the controlling clause with this verb and the marked clause with the medial
verb hu-mo. In 15-152b, the marked clause with the medial verb hu-mo is placed after
the controllong verb unu-ko-ng.
The first four aspectual verbs listed above are intransitive. They cross-reference the
person of the most salient core argument of the preceding verb, according to the
hierarchy given in Diagram 13-17 in § 13.3.4. For example,

In 15-153a, the aspectual verb tu(h)- cross-references the 1st person of the A
argument, and in 15-153b, the 1st person of the 0 argument, of the verb inak- 'to look

/ruh-/ 'to come out' .13

The realisation of the 1st person A suffix is as follows:
Rule 13-12Realisation of 1st Person A SuffixThe following rules apply before Rules 13-1- 13-5.
The 1st person A suffix, in singular, is combined with the following TAM
suffixes to take various forms:
(a) {1st A} -m -> -o-m
(b) {1st A} -k -> -ong
(c) {1st A} -w, -h -> -op
(d) {1st A} -r -> -oNn

(f) {1st A} -juu -> -osuu(g) {1st A} -u -> -ot-u
(h) {1st A} -o -> -om-o
It is realised as /-opi/ before the dual suffix /-til:(i) {1st A} -> -opi I_ -ti
In paucal/plural number, it, again, takes various forms. It fuses with the /r/
of the Perfect and Negative Optative suffixes, and /w/ of the Optative suffix
and the negative infix. It is realised as -opi word-finally, as -opi-r10 before
a vowel, and -oN in other environments.

Rules 13-2 and 13-6.
10Verbal Morphology13.2.3307Irregular Intransitive VerbsMotuna has five intransitive verbs which mark the person of S by the consonant
alternation of their stems. Among them, three verbs --- /tu(h)-/ 'Copula, to be', /pi(h)-/
'to go', and /hu(h)-/ 'to come'--- mark the paucal/plural exclusiveness of 1st and 3rd
person Ss by the prefix /u-/. 11 The other two verbs --- /paa(h)-/ 'to cry' and /puu(h)-/
'to die'--- mark it by the suffix /-ral. (In all these verb stems, the stem-final consonant
!hi occurs only when they are followed by a derivational suffix.)The morphological structure of three irregular verbs, /tu(h)-/ 'Copula, to be', /pi(h)-/
'to go', and /hu(h)-/ 'to come', is:

and gender suffixes discussed above are summarised below. The changes which affect
Imperative suffixes are discussed separately in§ 13.2.1.10 rather than formalised here.
Rule 13-8 does not apply to the paradigms of S0 verbs, but applies to the paradigms of
other intransitive and transitive verbs discussed below (cf. § 13.2.2.7 and§ 13.3.7),
and thus is given here for convenience.
(A) Rules of Fusion of Dual and Paucal/Plural Suffixes:

"The 3rd person paucal/plural 0 is one morpheme /-ur/ before a 1st or 2nd person A suffix, but is
split into two morphemes /-o/ and /-ru/ when intervened by a 3rd person A suffix. See also fn 1.
17Verbal Morphology333I -ur (3rd PCL 0) -> -ir I-iThe vowel /of of the 1st person paucal/plural exclusive suffix /-mor/ is assimilated to
the following a, as Rule 2-9a predicts.
Note that all the rules discussed in §13.2.1. and §13.2.2, i.e. Rules 13-1- 13-12,
apply to transitive verbs as well.
The paradigm of the transitive verb /noh-/ 'to say to/think about', with all the Ti}M
suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dualpaucal gender suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. The stem-final/h-I is deleted
before a consonant due to Rule 13-16a. The combination of the stem-final/h-I and the
3rd person A suffix /-ul is optionally dearticulated to /HJ before a CV sequence (except
before the sequences of /r/ and a high vowel in Near Past and Remote Past) due to Rule
13-20d. The vowel /of of the stem is assimilated to the following a due to Rule 2-9a.
In §13.3.15, I will give the paradigm of non-medial TAM forms with all the gendersuffixes listed in Table 13-3.","[361, 362]"

(ii) two events are simultaneous or successive habitual events. Alternatively, the event
expressed by the marked clause may be interpreted as the condition under which the
habitual event described by the controlling clause takes place. (These functions
correspond to (ii) and (iii) of General SS):

very often. The Continuous SS suffix, in particular, rarely occur with those verbs,Tense/ Aspect/Mood467except in negation or to describe the manner of activities rather than the activities

A person suffixes in transitive verbs. Thus, in the morphophonemic analysis below,
they are simply called ""A suffixes"".
Note that the initial/w/ of the 3rd person paucallplural A suffix /-wal is dropped after
a consonant. See Rule 13-16b in §13.4.1. Nonsingular number may be expressed by
a person suffix (/-oN/ for 1st paucallplural and /-wal for 3rd paucallplural), or by an
additional number suffix /-til (dual) or 1-ru/ (paucallplural).
Inclusive/exclusive distinction does not exist in A cross-referencing suffixes. 9

Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-paucal gender
suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. I will not make comments on the morphophonemic processes which have already been discussed in § 13.2.1. The realisation of

(XII-18)Verbal Morphology283CHAPTER 13 VERBAL MORPHOLOGY13.1INTRODUCTIONAs mentioned in § 12.2.2, verbs are classified as follows according to the types ,of
cross-referencing markings they take.
(1) In active voice:
(i) transitive verbs, which take 0 and A person/number suffixes.(ii) S0 intransitive verbs, which take 0 person/number suffixes and the 3rd person
dummy A suffix.
(iii) SA intransitive verbs, which take A person/number suffixes.
(iv) irregular intransitive verbs, which mark the person of S by the consonant
alternation of the stems, and the number of S by suffixes.
(2) In middle voice:
intransitive verbs which take middle voice person/number suffixes.
The paradigms of verbs in Motuna are described according to this classification.
Verbs take TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- c after cross-referencing morphemes. In addition, the negative infix /-woo-/ can be placed between crossreferencing markings and the Imaginative, General DS, Continuous SS or DS medial
suffix. TAM suffixes may be followed by gender suffixes in the case of fully inflected
non-medial verbs, or may be fused with a switch-reference marking in the case of
medial verbs. Schematically,
Diagram 13-1Basic Structure of Verbsgender
Stem-- S/0/A person/number-- (negative) -TAM- { 0lswitch-reference
Any adjacent morphemes may undergo rather complex morphophonemic changes.
All the TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- care given in Table 13-2 in a different
order. They will be indicated by capital letters hereafter. For example, ""definite future
TAM"" will be simply represented by ""Definite Future"" or ""DEFFUT"".","[309, 310, 311, 312]"
"438Chapter 15forms are summarised in Table 15-1 in pages 442 and 443.
Among the medial verbal forms, Perfect SS cannot be used with totally stative verbs
( 1). It is used with inchoative stative verbs (2) to focus on the inception of the states,
and with verbs (3) and (4) to focus on the completion of the events. On the other hand,
Continuous SS is used with verbs which belong to (1), (2), (3b) and (4b) to express
the continuation of states, but it is rarely used (except in negation, or to describe the
manner of an activity as is the case with konn-) with dynamic action verbs and termina- ,
tive verbs (3a and 4a).

same sentence, or understood from context.
The category ""habitual"" thus defined plays important roles in combination with medial verbs. cf.
§ 15.4.

middle voice the paucallplural (inclusive) suffix 1-ru/ is attached to the 3rd person nonsingular suffix.
This suffix is susceptible to Rules 13-2 and 13-6. cf. fn 1.","[347, 348, 349]"
"6Introduction5nonsingular there is also an inclusive/exclusive distinction (the Pouko dialect lacks this
distinction, cf. § 1.2). There is no 3rd person free pronoun, and the article and the
demonstrative are used as deictic/anaphoric pronouns instead.
The verbal morphology of Motuna is extremely complex. All the verbs mark the
person and number of core argument(s)- S, in the case of intransitive verbs, and 0 and
A, in the case of transitive verbs. They also distinguish active and middle voices,
similar to those found in classical Indo-Aryan languages. 7 A periphrastic agentless
passive construction is formed by participles and the auxiliary 'to become', which""is
mainly used when the speaker addresses or refers to someone in a special kin relation.
Similar to many other Papuan languages, Motuna has ""medial"" verbs which usually
occupy sentence-medial positions and are marked by switch-reference morphemes.
The endings of fully inflected ""non-medial"" verbs, on the other hand, mark the gender
of the topical argument of the sentence.
Motuna has an extensive tense/aspect/mood system. Non-medial verbs distinguish
fourteen tense/aspect/mood categories, while medial verbs distinguish three for the
same subject forms, and two for the different subject forms.
As for derivational morphology, verb stems may undergo four valency-changing
processes--- stimulative, applicative, causative and reciprocal. They can also derive
verbal nouns and participles.
Clause coordination is mainly achieved by chaining medial verbs. Medial verbs, by
their tense/aspect and switch-reference suffixes, track the themes of the whole discourse. Thematic coherence is further maintained by a rich array of conjunctions and
discourse markers. Due to these pragmatic factors, it is not sufficient to choose the
sentence as the linguistic unit of description, in the case of this language.","[33, 34]"

In 17-15, the dependent embedded clause tii haapi'-ku sets up the temporal framework
for the whole sentence. The perfect SS form pi-ro is controlled by tuujuu. The DS
marking of tuu-juu indicates that the state of the S referent of this verb 'our papa' is
contrasted with the main theme of the discourse, i.e. ""our (the narrator and her children) waiting at home"", which is understood from the context.

In 17-16, the overlapping referents of the twoS arguments, i.e. ""we two (the narratorand her daughter)"" of aat-opih and ""she (the narrator's daughter)"" of piruk-oro-mo, are
parts of the thematic framework of the whole discourse. Thus both of them are marked
by the SS suffixes.
The Continuous SS and DS forms, without explicit controlling clauses, are often
used to express the speaker's assertion that such states/durative events should continue

In the following sections, I will overview the chaining of medial clauses (§17.2),
and relative clauses (§17.3), with examples from my corpus. Detailed study of
complex sentences, especially that of the discourse structure of clause chaining, is left

Verbs marked by these suffixes do, however, not necessarily occupy the medial position of a sentence; they may even stand as the heads of independent sentences. cf. §17.1.",[464]
"Phonology29Examples of compounds:
roki=manni'certainly' (derived from the adverb roki 'just'
and the discourse marker manni 'certainly')Krismas=maaritah'Christmas holidays' (derived from the loan
noun Kirismas 'Christmas' and the derived
noun maarit=ah 'holidays')muu=riih-arei'to get dark' (derived from muu 'night' and
riih-arei 'to become (verbal noun)'kuma=kuma=nong=nga-wah'giggler' (derived from kuma=kuma 'laugh',
nong 'only' and nga-wah 'made (participle)')Syntactic constructions, on the other hand, are not lexical units. Their meanings are
predictable from the meanings of the c!{amrnatical) words in particular syntactic configurations. Examples:
nii-nnokoro=koronoi-ngung[me-COMITlanguageone]-pl'(those) who have one language with me'
hookongsi'haaro'-ki-no-mori[ART.Mmangofall.3S-HABPAST]-LINK-CL.season'the season when mangoes fall'
The first example above is a so-called bahuvrihi compound with the numeral noi,
incorporating its NP argument (cf. §7.1.3 and §8.2.2.1.1). Three grammatical words,
nii-nno, koro=koro and noi-ngung, constitute a single grammatical unit. The secondexample is a classifier construction, in which the classifier -mori is combined with an
intransitive verb with its S argument via the linker -no- (cf. §8.1.3 .2.5). Here again,
three grammatical words, hoo, kongsi' and haaro'-ki-no-mori, constitute a single
grammatical unit. I will hereafter associate such grammatical units by square brackets
in the interlinear text, as is shown in the above examples.","[57, 58]"

Table 4-3Underlying Forms of Number SuffixesSingular-0Dual-karoPaucal-naaPlural-ngungNote that the attachment of a number suffix to a noun is optional. It is not used
when the number of the object in question is obvious from the context. Inanimate
nouns c;lo not usually inflect for dual and paucal. 7
Examples:
4-14kupuri 'a stone/stones'
kupuri-ngung '(many) stones'I could find no examples of inanimate nouns marked by the dual or the paucal suffix in my corpus.
According to my informants, however, they can be marked by either of these if the duality or paucality
of the object referred to by the noun is focused on.
7Nouns4-1573nommai 'a person/people'
nommai-karol-ngaro 'two persons'
nommai-naa 'a few/several persons'
nommai-ngung '(many) people'The initial /k/ of the dual suffix /-karol is often realised as ng. A similar phenomenon
is observed as regards all the case suffixes which begin with /k/ (the ergative /-kif, the
purposive /-ko/, the ablative /-kitee/ and the locative /-koril). The morphophonemic
processes which apply to all these suffixes are informally summarised as follows.''
Rule 4-1Realisation of /kl in the Dual Suffix /-karol and Other SuffixesWhen /k/ is preceded by the archinasal IN/, it is obligatorily realised as ng.
It is realised either k or ng when it is preceded by a sequence of a nasal or avelar stop and a vowel, or by a high or back vowel. The more phonemes of
this type exist in adjacent syllables, the more it is likely to be realised as
ng.sExamples:
4-16nungamong-ngaro 'two men'
koringono-karo/-ngaro 'two enemies'
poo'ki-karo/-ngaro 'two babies'
kuraisa-karo/-ngaro 'two women'
ko'sa-karo 'two shells/friends'

However, when case suffixes are preceded by pronouns, the article or the demonstrative, lkJ may be
realised asj, or may be fused with preceding vowels. cf. Chs 5 and 6. See also Rule 4-5 in §4.4 for

sentence may be uttered by anyone in such a situation:
4-18muumaa-naa, reewoopi- '=tuiee?lord-pcwherego.2S-pcl.PRESPROG .DPyou.nonsg'My lord, where are you going?'
In the following sentence, the speaker addresses his brother-in-law in dual form (cf.

Apart from the two obligatory grammatical categories discussed above, the semantic
categories of the referents of nouns may optionally be indicated by classifiers. The
categories expressed by classifiers include 'human', 'animate', 'long object', 'concave
object', 'taro', 'stone', 'human habitation', 'day', etc.
Classifiers are always combined with various bound morphemes, or nouns or verbal
clauses. Classifier constructions thus formed may be juxtaposed to head nouns, may
be employed in headless noun phrases, or may function as NP heads by themselves. I
have attested fifty-one classifiers in my corpus and from elicitation.
Some nouns can take two or more different classifiers in different contexts. For
example, the human noun nommai 'person/people', which is either masculine or
feminine, can take the 'human' classifier -uru, the 'animate' classifier -wori 'animate',
the 'lot' classifier -ngu and the 'group of people' classifier -po injuxtaposition: 10The speaker could also use the paucal form po-owoi-naa (cf. 4-102c in §4.4.4.1.3) to address him,
and verbal forms with a paucal subject such as taapu-r-ong-hee, pi-'-hee.","[101, 102, 103]"
"6.2.4The Article with the Empatic Suffix /-ko/The article, either as a determiner or as NP head, may have special functions when
the emphatic particle /-koP is attached to it. In such cases, it may be used either
deictically or anaphorically. In deictic use, it refers to the entity outside the sphere of
both the speaker and the addressee. In anaphoric use, it singles out the entity which is
referred to in the preceding discourse. For example,
6-22aTantanu-kirokinoh-u-r-u-ng:""ho-kohiuo'ancestor's. name'justsay .to-30.3A-pcl-RMP AST -MART.M-EMPHclay.potmono-ji-'-hee.""

see-30.3pcl.A-RMPAST -M'Now they saw that clay pot filled with various kinds of food.' (III-42)
Ho-ko in 6-22a is used deictically, pointing to the clay pot which is located outside
the reach of both Tantanu and the children. Ho-ko in 6-22b, on the other hand, is in
anaphoric use, singling out the clay pot just referred to. Note that the demonstrative

denote distributional plurality. cf. § 10.3.3.4.

VerbsUnderlying forms of cross-referencing markings of four types of intransitive verbs,
given in Tables 13-5, 13-8, 13-10 and 13-12, are summarised in Table 13-13 in the
next page. See also Table 12-2a- c.
From Table 13-13 it may be summarised that:
( 1) 1st person is marked either by a nasal consonant (predominantly by /ml) or a vowel
/of.(2) 2nd person is predominantly marked either by /r/ (alternatively, /p/ or /hi), or a high
front vowel /if.
(3) 3rd person is predominantly marked by zero or the labial glide /w/ (alternatively, /p/
or /h/), or a back vowel /u/, or /wa/.
(4) Singular number is zero, dual number is marked by /-til, paucal/plural inclusive328Chapter 13number by /-ru/. Paucal/plural exclusive is marked by special forms.
(5) In addition, singular and nonsingular numbers are contrasted by the vowel /o/ and/eel in middle voice suffixes (except for the 1st person exclusive which is marked
by the vowel /a/).
The persons of free, reflexive and possessive pronouns (§5.2) are contrasted in
similar ways to the cross-referencing markings shown above. In general, the 1st
person of these pronouns is marked by the nasal /nl, the 2nd person by /r/, and the 3rd
person by /p/. Singular and nonsingular number (except for 1st person exclusive) are ''
indicated by the vowel /o/ and lee/, respectively, in most cases.'

VERBSTransitive verbs have the following basic morphological structure:
Diagram 13-14Basic Structure of Transitive Verbsgender
Stem- 0 person- A person- (dl/pcl) - (negative)- TAM - { ~~switch-referenceVerbal Morphology329As is shown above, the cross-referencing marking of transitive verbs consists of 0
and A person suffixes (which may also indicate paucallplural number and exclusiveness), and a dual or paucal/plural number suffix. The paradigm of 0 and A person/
number suffixes is given in Table 13-15a in page 330. The morphological structure of
the suffixes given in Table 13-15a is analysed in Table 13-15b in page 331. The
underlying forms of person and number suffixes are summarised in Tables 13-15c and
13-15d in page 332.
Note that A suffixes are identical with SA suffixes, and 0 suffixes with the initial
consonants of S0 suffixes. cf. Table 13-13. 14 Note also that inclusive/exclusive ·~
distinction exists only in paucallplural 0. 15 The initial /w/ of the 3rd person paucallplural A suffix /-wa/ is dropped after a consonant, as is mentioned in § 13.2.2, due to Rule
13-16b.
The only exception I have attested for Table 13-15 is the verb /kung-/ 'to bring/take
sb to one's place', which takes a 2nd person 0 suffix /-n/ instead of 1-r/. See similar
exceptions of middle voice suffixes in § 13.2.4.
Number suffixes are also identical with those used with intransitive verbs. In some
cases, however, the reduplication of an /rV/ string may indicate the nonsingularity of 0
and/or A. Such reduplication may be obligatory or optional. (Optional reduplication is
indicated by square brackets in Tables 13-15a and b.)
To sum up, the number of 0 and A is indicated as follows:
(1) If 0 is singular, a number suffix (/-til for dual and /-ru/ for pel), or the pel form ofA (in 1st and 3rd persons), reflects the number of A.
(2) If 0 is nonsingular and A is singular, a number suffix (/-til for dual and /-ru/ for
pel), or, if such a suffix does not exist, the pel form of A (in 1st person) 16 or 0 (in
1st person exclusive or 3rd person), reflects the number of 0.
(3) If 0 and A are nonsingular, a number suffix (/-til for dual and /-ru/ for pel), or, if
such a suffix does not exist, the pel form of A (in 1st person), reflects the number
of 0. In addition, the pel form of either A or 0, or a reduplication of an /ro/ string,
reflects the nonsingularity of A.
(4) The optional reduplication of an /rV/ string emphasises the plurality of all the
participants, which must include either a 1st person or 2nd person A.","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358]"
"502Chapter 17CHAPTER 17 INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS17.1INTRODUCTIONAccording to the syntactic and pragmatic functions in interclausal relations, clauses in'J
Motuna are classified into independent and dependent clauses. There are two types of
dependent clauses --- those dependent at sentence level, and those dependent at suprasentence or discourse level. According to Foley and Van Valin's (1984: 238ff.)
terminology, I call the former ""dependent embedded"" and the latter ""dependent nonembedded"" clauses respectively. Schematically,

""non-embedded""""embedded""Independent clauses may stand alone as syntactically self-contained units. The
predicates of independent clauses may be verbs, nouns, or adjectives (cf. Ch 3). They
may optionally be combined with dependent clauses of either type.
All the dependent non-embedded clauses are verbal clauses with medial verbs as their
heads. They can often stand as separate sentences, 1 but their dependency on the
discourse structure is overtly marked by switch-reference suffixes.
Dependent embedded clauses are verbal clauses, whose heads are non-medial verbs
The boundary between sentences is determined primarily by the existence of illocutionary force (cf.
Foley and VanValin 1984: 220-221), which is reflected in intonation patterns. In general, the end of a
declarative sentence is marked by a natural falling in pitch after the final stressed mora, with a
significant pause before another sentence starts. cf. §2.8. Sentences with verbs in Imperative, Definite
Future, and Continuous SS/DS (such as 17-1 b -c and 17-17) which express the speaker's commands or
assertions seem to be characterised by a steeper falling in pitch at the end than declarative sentences, but
this needs further investigation.
1There are cases where two or more independent clauses, with fully inflected non-medial verbs as
predicates, are uttered in one string. Unless such indepedent clauses are connected together by rii-ku (cf.
§7.2.3), I regard each clause as a separate sentence.","[530, 531]"
"1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY AND LANGUAGE DATA

by two main female informants, Dora Leslie from Kaakotokori village, and Therese
Minitong Kemelfield from Panakee village. They are native speakers of the standard
Basic voice distinction may well be a typological feature common to most Non-Austronesian
languages in Bougainville. It is attested in Nasioi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hurd and
Hurd 1966, 1970), in Nagovisi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hunt and Hunt 1973) and in
Konua (middle voice corresponds to ""passive and reflexive"" in MUller 1954). The existence o~distinct

combinations of 0 (1-rnl, 1-r/ or zero) and the invariable (dummy) 3rd person A suffix
/-u/ in singular. 2 In dual number, and in paucallplural inclusive, they additionally take
the suffixes /-til and /-ru/, respectively, after 1-ul. Paucal/plural exclusive 0 suffixes

The full paradigm of S 0 verb /kaah-/ 'to disagree/not to want', with all the TAM
suffixes listed in Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dualpaucal gender suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. Note that the stem-final /h/ is
deleted before a consonant due to Rule 13-16 in § 13.4.1.","[314, 315]"
"2I regard them as subordinating conjunctions because the syntactic behaviour of medial clauses
introduced by them diffe~from that of other medial clauses. The former always occupy the initial
positions of sentences, and cannot stand as separate sentences on their own. (In this respect their
behaviour is similar to that of protases in Imaginative. cf. 17-3.) The latter, on the other hand, can be
placed after or within the controlling clauses, and can stand as separate sentences on their own. See the
discussion below and in § 17 .2.
This sentence has no controlling clause. The continuous SS form noh-u-i expresses a durative
event going on at the reference point of time understood from the context. See the discussion of
examples 17-15-17-17 below.
3506Chapter 17Dependent embedded clauses introduced by tii may also function as post-head
attributes:

In most cases, however, medial verbal clauses function as dependent non-embedded
clauses. Switch-reference markings track the ""theme"" of the discourse (cf. Roberts
1988b).
In Motuna, ""theme"" and ""topic"" are two distinct categories. As exemplified inCh 3,
""topic"" is a focal NP argument (usually in absolutive case) in a clause. In a verbal
clause it could be A, 0, S, or a local argument, and is cross-referenced by the gender
suffix on the non-medial verb. It does not control switch-reference operation.
17-11tiko tiikongsi'-kopoo'patak-a-romanniandmango-PURPunderneatharrive-3pcl.S-PERF.SSthenART.Lnah-a-a-na: ""... ""
say .to-30.3pcl.A-RMPAST-F'And after they had arrived at the underneath of the mango tree, they said
to her: "" ... ""' (VIII-11)
In 17-11, the topic of the clause with the non-medial verb nah-a-a-na is the 0 argument
'her', which is cross-referenced by the feminine ending -na on the same verb. The
topic of the preceding medial verb patak-a-ro may be the S argument 'they' or the local
argument tii kongsi'-ko poo' 'at the underneath of the mango tree', neither of which is
coreferential with the topic of this controlling clause. If the topic were to control the
switch-reference operation, we would expect that this medial verb would be marked by
the DS suffix -ku. But in fact it is marked by the SS suffix -ro.
As is shown in the above example, switch-reference is usually sensitive to the
coreference of SfA arguments, as in other Papuan languages, and not to the coreference
of clausal topics as defined above. However, there are also many instances where
medial verbs are in the same subject forms even though S/A are not coreferential. e.g.:
17-12tikohooandART.M DEM.DPoiP.o-no-ori''female.name' DEM-LINK-sister.pclturu-woo-roimpanii-komannireturn-MID.3S-PERF.SSand. then1-EMPHcertainlypee-mo

be.transferred-MID.lS.RMPAST-F'And P. and her sisters' father returned, and then, I was certainly trans
ferred.' (XVI-40, cf.11-14)Interclausal Relations507Here the referent of the S of turu-woo-ro (the narrator's husband) and that of the
controlling verb tini-mon-na (the narrator herself) are different. They are regarded,
however, as parts of the same referential framework which includes all the members of
the narrator's family living and moving together.
It is clear from the above example that switch-reference does not operate within the
boundaries of a sentence, but is a thematic operation which essentially identifies the
frame of that particular discourse with that of the adjacent discourse. It is true that S/A
are the major components of such framework in that if they are the same or their
referents overlap, medial verbs are always in the same subject forms. But the spe3ker
can also regard different participants referred to by S/A arguments as belonging to the
same group for discourse reasons, as in 17-12.
Medial verbal clauses often stand as separate sentences. 4 In some cases, the
controlling clause of such a medial clause exists in, or is easily recovered from, the
preceding or following sentence. For example,

Note that in some interjections, such as ehe;ehee 'laughter', u'uung 'yes', hu'uung

Most of the stems of this type have been found in the corpus of daily conversation of
my two main informants, and in the life stories of the two informants who have less
contact with other native speakers (and thus use loan words quite frequently):

"Preview of Verbs2 55CHAPTER 12 PREVIEW OF VERBS12.1INTRODUCTIONVerbs in Motuna distinguish the following grammatical categories:
(1) Active and middle voice. They are distinguished by different sets of S/A/0 crossreferencing bound morphemes. Motuna also has a periphrastic passive construe;...
tion (cf. § 16.3.4).
(2) Medial and non-medial verbs. I call the verbs which mark switch-reference ""medial
verbs"", while those which don't ""non-medial verbs"".' Switch-reference markings indicate whether the ""themes"" 2 of the medial verbal clauses are the same as,
or are different from, those of the following clauses. 3 Fully inflected non-medial
verbs, on the other hand, cross-reference the genders of the sentential topics.
(3) Fourteen TAM categories for non-medial verbs, and three for the same subject
forms and two for the different subject forms of medial verbs.
(4) Verb stems may be underived or derived. Derived stems may take one or more of
the four valency changing suffixes --- stimulative, applicative, causative and
reciprocal.
As mentioned in §3.2.1, verbs consist of the following morphological elements.
1) verb stems,
2) bound morphemes which cross-reference the person and number of core
argument(s),
3) tense/aspect/mood (hence TAM) suffixes, andNote that ""medial verbs"" do not necessarily occupy the medial positions of sentences; they may
even stand as the heads of separate sentences, cf. § 17.1. Some ""non-medial verbs"", on the other hand,
may function as the heads of dependent embedded clauses, and in such cases they may occupy sentencemedial positions.
12Themes often coincide with the grammatical subjects (S or A) of the verbs, but not always, cf.","[283, 284]"

As mentioned in §3.2.1, I use the symbol 0 and A, to indicate the grammatical
functions of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses, which play the roles of the Undergoer and the Actor respectively. In Motuna, 0 is always denoted by an absolutive noun
phrase, but A can be denoted either by an ergative or absolutive noun phrase. When A
is a sentential topic, it must be denoted by an absolutive NP. 13
When A is in ergative case, word order is free. However, when A is in absolutive
case, A must precede 0. For example, in 3-63, the 0 NP in absolutive case (tii Perui)
and the A NP in ergative case (ho-i Paanaangah) are interchangeable, but not the two
NPs in absolutive case in the following sentence:
