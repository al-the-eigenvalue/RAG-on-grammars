"If the verb of the clause of indirect discourse is negativized the
element -k precedes the negative postfix -?aha (no. 18 below) and
such cases are not to be confused with the negative postfix -k?aha

inchoative forms of static verbs. When used with active verbs
(4.55) or inchoative static verbs (4.74) it forms what may be called
their negative semelfactive paradigm. Examples:

-k?aha is used to build what may be called the negative habitual
paradigm of active verbs (4.55) or of inchoative static verbs (4.74),
even though, on the formal level, it may be attached only to their
semelfactive forms. Examples:

negative postfix which is used in still other ways, viz., with nonirchoative forms of static verbs (4.74) and with independent
personal pronouns, nouns, and adjectives when these are used as
predicative words. Moreover, when a predicative noun is modified
by an adjective or when a non-inchoative static verb or a predicative adjective is modified by a comparative, the element -?aha is
attached to the adjective or to the comparative, as the case may
require. F-amples:
?use'paha’ni
(4B:w) he was not pleased
(< ?us?e’pa he
was pleased, non-inch. st. vb., + -?aha + -a’nt)
?u'wrehé (19:e) it isnot he (< ?u’wi, 3ms pron., + -?aha)
ka’pas?ché. (12:b) It is not a chicken. (< ka’pas chicken,

(pa'n?oho'nt < pa’nu very, comp., + -?aha + -a’ni, modifying la’pu good, adj.)In addition, -?aha may be added to an active verb infinitive to
form a prohibitive with or without the further addition of the
imperative postfix -tan (no. 11, above), e.g.,
ta’la ki’Cuin, 2a'm?ché.
(4a:y) Don’t go into the canebrake!

"54HAASTUNICAtional notion normally indicated by a non-causative auxiliary, the
latter auxiliary may follow the causative one, as in the examples
quoted above.
The paucity of examples of double periphrasis
seems to be caused by a certain reluctance on the part of the informant to use the process. Thus it turns out that causative stems
usually exhibit no difference between the immutable and the mu-table duratives (4.532). Since the mutable durative requires the
use of the habitual suffix, its occurrence with causative stems
would call for double periphrasis. But because of the informant’s
tendency to avoid the process an immutable durative is often
found where one would expect a mutable durative, as in pa’kan?una'ni (4B:d) “he was replying,’ used in place of the more
correct pa'kahk?u't?una’ni (4a:d). At other times the informant
tries to get around the situation by using an incorrect form involving the use of the habitual suffix and the complete omission of
any element indicative of causativity, e.g., ku’hpahk?u’rana'ni
(10:d) as against ku’hpan?u'rana'ni (4a:aj) ‘they were feathering (arrows),” and é0’luhk?una’ni (54:a) as against ¢o’lun?una'ni
(5a:b) “it was dripping (down).”’ It seems likely that both alternatives for each example are incorrectly used in place of forms in-volving double periphrasis, viz., *ku’hpahk?u'nt?urana’ni and
*(o'luhk?u’t?una’ni, respectively.
4.545 The following synopsis of 3mMs subjective forms shows
the principal differences in inflection between the non-causative
and causative categories. The prefix tzhk-, occurring with the causative examples, is the 3rs alienable pronominal prefix used asdirect object (4.56).

On the formal level both of these postfixes must be added to the
non-periphrastic semelfactive paradigms of non-causative verbs(4.521)or to the regularsemelfactiveparadigmsof causativeHANDBOOKOFAMERICANINDIANLANGUAGES55verbs (4.542, rule 1). However, on the functional level the element -aha is used to form what may be called the negative semelfactive paradigm of active verbs while the element -k?aha is usedto form what may be called the negative habitual paradigm of
active verbs. The following synopsis illustrates the difference between the positive and negative forms of these verbs.

both cases is § and, as is shown later (5.32), probably represents
an archaic derivative prefix *-§(7)- which may have served the
function of converting active stems into static stems.

4.1INFLECTION
GENERALREMARKSInflection is accomplished almost exclusively by means of syntactic affixes of the inflective type. However, suppletion and reduplication are employed in the inflection of the auxiliary verbs
and the periphrastic inflection of active verbs is accomplished by
juxtaposition with auxiliary verbs.
The primary paradigmatic categories of the verb consist of the
semelfactive, habitual, and repetitive aspects, and the conditional
mode. Each of these categories comprises a separate paradigm
and the inflectional categories of each paradigm consist of person,
number, and gender. On the other hand, the expression of the
future tense and of several types of modes (including an alternative method of expressing the conditional) is accomplished by
means of postfixes (i.e., syntactic affixes of the non-inflective
type) but does not function as a part of the inflectional system of
verbs as such.
Two paradigms of personal pronouns are distinguished, the
dependent and the independent. The inflectional categories employed by both are the same as those of verbal paradigms, namely,
person, number, and gender.
The primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and
the determinative.
The latter is further subdivided into three
case-categories, the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.
It is noteworthy that whereas the gender and number of a noun are
of primary importance on the syntactic level, these are not explicitly defined on the morphological level except in the definitive
case.
It will now be pertinent to further describe the inflectional cate-gories of person, number,and gender.",[35]
"He himself always spoke veryrapidly as if he might be in danger of forgetting the words if he did
not utter them as fast as possible. But in contrast to his own manner of speaking he says that ‘“‘the old people sitting around the fire
telling stories always talked slow, slow.’’ In addition he oftencommented on the fact that the old people “‘spoke more plain.”
In spite of the obvious deficiencies in Youchigant’s command of
the language, I think it is safe to say that I obtained as much linguistic information from him as it is possible to obtain. While it
cannot be denied that there are certain lacunae in this material,
most of these are to be interpreted as lacunae in his knowledge of
the language. Although the grammatical analysis of a dying language presents for this reason many problems and difficulties, I
have made every attempt to present the grammar of Tunica in thesame way that I would present that of a living language.
Most of the illustrative material quoted in the chapters on
morphology and syntax is taken from my book Tunica Tezts.? The
source is given in parentheses immediately after the Tunica exam-ple.",[10]

available material. Some of these are probably archaic and most
of them are of doubtful meaning.
(31) -we, prob. an archaic exhortative postf., occurring in two
identical examples, viz., sa’kunawé (224:f, 22B:f) which the informant translated as ‘‘Let’s eat!” If the first person dual is implied it should be sa’k?inawé and the form as dictated is apparentlyincorrect. In corroboration of this we find that Gatschet wrote the
form as sa’kinawe ! and, since he did not record glottal stops, we
may read his form as sa’k?inawe < sa'k?ina “we eat’? + -we.(82) -yo, of no certain meaning, occurring only in the word
?7’mayo (4A:ar, 4B:ap, 4B:aq, 4B:ar) with the meaning “‘It is I”
(< ?¢’ma, 1s pron., + -yo).
(33) -tan, some kind of subordinating postf. In the only two
instances of its occurrence it is translated once as ‘‘after’’ and once
as “while,” e.g., 2a’m?uhkitan (4a:p) “after he had gone” (< ?a’m?uhki “he had gone” + -tan); hi’htin, ?u'natan (4a:bd) “‘while
he lived there” (?u'natan < ?u’na “he lived” + -tan).
(84) An element -at (or possibly -hat, though apparently unrelated to no. 21) is used once with a verb form, viz., po’nihcét (30)
“when I looked” (< po’ni “I looked” + -héi + -at or -hat). It is
assumed that -hci may be the unapocopated form of -hé (no. 4
above) but it has not been possible to establish a meaning for -at
or -hat; note that po’nihé (< po’ni + -hé) would mean ‘“‘when I
looked.”
(35)In one case an element -?aha is used in a context whichdoes not require a negative (see no. 18). In this case it has seemed
appropriateto rendertheelementas‘“‘indeed,”’viz.,te’hé?ehé,?o’wand (13:y) “It is she, indeed, (that) I want.” (ti’héehe < ta’hi, 3FS8 pron., + -?aha). Though the same form could mean “‘it is
not she,” such a rendition would not fit the context.
9.37ORDEROF THEPOSTFIXESIn certain cases more than one postfix is attached to the same
word and in this event their order is fixed. Note the following
rules. The references are to 9.32, 9.33 and 9.34:
Rule 1. The quotative postfix -a’ni (no. 6) follows any other
postfix which is used with the same word, e.g.,
lu'piwik?ahéa'nt.

"But inasmuch as the position of certain predicate modifiers is relatively free (rule 8 below), it sometimes happens that the independent subject follows a predicate modifier, e.g.,
(sc) hinya’tthé, (pm) la'hontéhku, (18) to'stohdku, (pw) na’rawth¢é
(9:g) then when the little one got up very earlyMoreover, in case it is desired to give especial emphasis to the
independent subject it may be placed after the predicative word.

before the predicative word. In such a case the independent object and the predicative word will often be included in the same
phrase, i.e., will not be separated by phrasing. Note also that the

other languages of the vicinity is a matter of accident. At present
it serves no sociological function whatsoever and when a language
has reached that stage it is to all intents and purposes a dead language. Hence it is to be assumed that what Youchigant recalls of
Tunica is at best a mere remnant of what the language must have
been when many speakers used it as their only means of communication. Indeed, I often had the feeling that the Tunica grooves in
Youchigant’s memory might be compared to the grooves in a
phonograph record; for he could repeat what he had heard but
was unable to make up new expressions of his own accord. He
himself is keenly aware of his deficiencies and often expressed his
regret that he so seldom heeded his mother when she reprimanded
him for speaking French instead of Tunica. He is also conscious
of the fact that his polylingualism interferes with his ability to recall Tunica.
Youchigant’s comments with respect to the speech of the “‘oldpeople’ deserve some attention.","[9, 10]"

only by means of their melody. Others, however, require some
sort of phonetic increment in addition to their melody.
All examples of Tunica words quoted in this grammar are pause
forms when their phrase-final melody is indicated (e.g., ha’rakatt
“‘she sings’’; ta’rustaku ““Rabbit”’; ka’tan ‘“‘where’’) while examples
quoted without a melody are context forms (e.g., ha’raka’ts “‘she

2.42STRESSLOSSES ANDSHIFTS REQUIREDBY PAUSEFORMS2.421
Since all of the phrase-final melodies preclude a stress on
the ultima of the words with which they are used, special incremental pause forms are constructed for words which would otherwise have a stress on their ultima (2.48, rule 5).
2.422 In the case of words which take the rising and low
phrase-final melodies on their penultima (1.6), their penultimate
stress, if any, is lost, e.g.,

"A word, phrase, or clause serving in oneof these functions is known as a syntactic element of a larger
clause or of a sentence.
Syntactic elements arebuiltupintoclauseswhichmaybedivided into two principal types: main and subordinate. The lat.
ter are further subdivided into four functional types: dependent,
complementary, relative, and adverbial.
The various types of clauses are built up into three main types
of sentences: simple, compound, and complex. Simple sentences
differ from main clauses only in that they stand alone. Compound
sentences are rare but contain two or more main clauses. Complex sentences, on the other hand, are very common and consist
of a main clause and one or more of the various types of subordinate clauses.
This brief summary is intended to elucidate the terminology
used in the immediately following sections (7.3 to 7.5) in which is |
presented a more detailed discussion of syntax in reverse order,
viz., sentences, clauses, and syntactic elements. The syntactic
uses of the various word-classes are discussed in section 10.
7.3TypesoFSENTENCES7.31 Simple sentences must contain one but only one predicative word and they may contain this word alone. In addition they
may contain any one of the other syntactic elements or any combination of these. Examples:

is desired to express the habitual aspect in periphrastic inflection
(4.531; 4.542, rule 2; 4.544, rule 2). Although the causative suffix
and the habitual suffix are mutually exclusive, a causative stemmay form a habitual theme in the same way as a non-causative
stem but in this event the causative nature of the verb is indicated
by the use of the causative auxiliary (4.542, rule 2; 4.544, rule 2).",[68]
"When adjectives are used with nouns functioning as sub-jects or objects, they are incorporated into the noun complex; see10.41.
In some cases quantificatives are also so incorporated
(10.21) and in still other cases they stand in apposition to the
noun (7.591).
7.56THEPREDICATEMODIFIERPredicate modifiers may be words, phrases, or clauses. Words
used in this way are adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, and locative nouns. Phrases and clauses used in this way are always adverbial.
Adjectives are used as modifiers of noun predicative words,
€.g.,
ciéku, ku’wa lapo'ni.(43a: b) The crow woodpecker i is a goodbird, it is said. (lapo’nt < la’pu good + -a’ni, modifying
the noun ku’wa bird)Comparatives are used as modifiers of adjective, quantificative,
and static verb predicative words, e.g.,
ta’nisarahé, ta’ gle pano'ni. (3a:a) The girl was very beautiful,
it is said. (pano'nt < pa’nu very + -a’ni, modifying the
adj. ta’ Sle beautiful)se’man, na’mu ri'kine'nt. (29:c) They were too many, it is said.
(ri'kine'nt < ri'kint too + -a’nt, modifying the quantif.
na'mu many)
sinsru'ka pana'ni. (18:b) They were greatly frightened, it is
said. (pana'ni < pa'nu very, greatly + -a’ni, modifying
the st. vb. sinsru’ka)Adverbs and locative nouns are used as modifiers of auxiliary
and active verb predicatives, e.g.,
hi’ Stahahk ?awa'cina’?ara’ni.
(22a:1) They were still fighting
together, it is said. (hz’Stahahki still, adv., modifying the
act. vb. ?awa’éina’?ara’nt)
?u'ris 2ata’ni. (4a:ae) She went to his house, it is said. (?u’/ris¢

a substantive governed by a postposition, e.g.,

use as predicate modifiers is illustrated in 7.46.
7.57THEPREDICATETheirCOMPLEMENTPredicate complements complete the sense of the predicate and
may be either words or clauses. Words used in this way are independent personal pronouns, nouns, interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, adjectives, and active verb infinitives.
Independent personal pronouns, nouns, and interrogativeindefinite pronouns are used as complements of static verb predicatives or of impersonal or transimpersonal active verb predicatives, e.g.,
?u’win, ?uspt't?oke'ni, ta’héin. (13:an) He forgot her, it is said.
(ta’hét, 3FS pron., complement of the st. vb. ?usp7’t?ake’nt)

owl, it is said < it turned him into a horned owl, it is said.(ni’ma a horned owl, complement of the trsimp. act. vb.

the logical subject (grammatical object) of the static verb, e.g.,

"He does not get angry < ?uya’ sitt + -k?ahaThe reason for this is to be found in the fact that the positive inchoative forms of static verbs are constructed by the use of elements normally employed by active verbs (4.731).
4.8NounINFLECTION4.81GENERALREMARKSThe primary categories of the noun are the indeterminative and
the determinative. The indeterminative category consists of the
simple uninflected noun stem which may serve as either a singularor a plural, e.g., ru’sta ‘‘a rabbit; rabbits.””Thedeterminativecategory, on the other hand, is marked by the use of the determin-ing prefixes, i.e., either the articular prefix (4.82) or the pronominal prefixes (denoting possession with nouns; 4.83). In addition
the determinative category is subdivided into three case categories: the definitive, the non-definitive, and the locative.! The
first of these is called the definitive because it requires the use of
the gender-number suffixes (4.841) and is the only category in
which the gender and number of a noun are explicitly defined.’
The non-definitive case makes use of no inflectional suffixes whatsoever and may be construed as either a singular or a plural depending on context. The locative case is expressed by one of three
locative suffixes (4.85) and, like the non-definitive case, may be
construed as either a singular or a plural depending on context.
1 The syntactic functions of these cases are described in section 10.11.
? The rules for the gender-number classification of nouns are provided in section 8.1.",[61]
"Derivational affixes, as indicated above, are added to primary
stems to make secondary stems. Syntactic affixes are best subdivided into the inflective type and the non-inflective type. Inflective affixes are always appended to stems while non-inflective
affixes may be appended only to formally complete words. Once
the necessary inflective affixes are appended to a stem, the result
18 @ word which is, by means of these affixes, fully defined as to its
relation to other words within a phrase or sentence. Such affixes
are employed extensively for purposes of inflection and define
person, number, gender, possession, aspect, and, in one instance,
modality.",[34]
"The auxiliary verbs have the following unique characteristics:
(1) All of them exhibit the same general types of irregularities ininflection, namely, that certain forms are inflected like non-inchoative static verbs, others like non-causative active verbs in the
semelfactive aspect, while still others are unanalyzable. (2) Certain of these irregularities are occasioned by the use of supple-tion, a process not used by any other word-class of the language.
(3) Reduplication is regularly employed in the formation of their
repetitive paradigms, and, like suppletion, is not used elsewhere in
the language. (4) All of these verbs are employed in the periphrastic inflection of active verbs although all but one of them
may also be used independently.
Thecharacteristics of active verbs, which fall into two inflec-tional categories(non-causativeandcausative), are as follows:(1) Non-causatives are inflected(a)by suffixation, as exhibitedin the use of the semelfactive, habitual, and conditional sets of
endings, or (b) by juxtaposition, as exhibited in periphrastic constructions involving the auxiliary verbs. (2) Causatives are normally inflected only by juxtaposition. (3) Both types of verbs are
inflected for object by means of the alienable pronominal prefixes.
Static verbs exhibit the following inflectional traits: (1) Their
non-inchoative forms are constructed by means of the inalienable
pronominal prefixes which function on the grammatical level as
objects, on the interpretive level as subjects. (2) Their inchoative
forms are constructed by the use of certain active verb inflectional elements but at the same time retain the inalienable pronominal prefixes in the function just described.",[39]
HANDBOOKOFAMERICANINDIANLANGUAGES57which can never be substantivally expressed within the sentence.,"[55, 56]"
"All other phrase-final words (including predicative words of other
than main clauses) will have the rising melody if they stand in
sentence-medial position or the low melody if they stand in sentence-final position, e.g.,
yu'kawthé, se’hitehe'nt, hi’ Stahahk.",[88]
"In their periphrastic usage,however, this aspect is expressed by placing a semelfactive form of
the auxiliary after a habitual theme (< an active verb stem + thehabitual thematic suffix -hk-, 5.213). This rule applies in the case
of all of the auxiliaries except ?u’hkz which, on its part, is never
used with a habitual theme.
When the auxiliaries are used in periphrastic inflection their
primary meanings are largely obscured. Certain ones of them are
used to express the secondary verbal categories which include thepast tense(4.532)and the immutableand mutableduratives(4.533). These categories are secondary for two reasons, (1) they
are not obligatory and (2) they cannot be expressed without the
inclusion of one of the primary categories. The special function of
each auxiliary when it is used in periphrasis is discussed in the
following sections.
4.5382 The auxiliary ?u’hki “he is, was’ (4.421) is regularly
employed to express the notion of priority in'time. It covers the
simple past, the present perfect, and the past perfect tenses of
English. Examples:
?unt'wihkt.(4a:v) you told him < ?uhk-, 3Ms pref., + nz’ totell + w2i’hki, 2ms smlf.

3MS repet., + -a’n2, quot. postf.
ra’ paw’ hk?thé (19: c) if you have killed < ra’pa to kill + w’hk27, 2Ms cond., + -hé4.533The positional auxiliaries,?«’ra “he lies, lay”(4.422)and ?u'na “he sits, sat’ (4.423), are used periphrastically to exPress two types of duratives, the immutable and the mutable. In
expressing the immutable durative either of the positionals may be
added to an unextended active verb stem or to any theme except
the habitual. In expressing the mutable durative, on the other
hand, either of the positionals must be added to a habitual theme.",[48]
"Non-inflective affixes consist of the preverbsThe former indicate direction of movementand thewhile thelatter express a wider range of notions, including coordination,
Subordination, tense, and additional types of modality.
The word-classes of Tunica, which have been worked out
3.3On the basis of syntactic as well as inflectional considerations, are
as follows: the independent personal pronouns, nouns, the interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, postpositions,36HAASTUNICAadjectives, comparatives, adverbs, the auxiliary verbs, active
verbs, static verbs, sentence connectives, and exclamatives andimitatives.","[34, 35]"
"(10:Mc)?uha’ytk(Pw:Mc)he got to the house,the oldBut even though there is a strong tendency to place the predicative word at the end of the sentence or clause, this order is not toorigidly adhered to. For example, certain predicate modifiers are
permitted to stand after the predicative word although they are
just as likely to be placed before it (rule 8 below). It should be
noted, however, that this freedom is applied most frequently in
the case of the predicative word of a main clause and rarely in the
case of the predicative word of a subordinate clause. In addition
to the possibility of placing certain types of predicate modifiers
after the predicative word, we find that the independent subject
may occasionally follow this word (see rule 3 below).
Rule 3. The independent subject tends to precede all other
syntactic elements in the clause except the sentence connective,

7.5TasSyntactic
7.51ELEMENTSGENERALOFTHECLAUSEREMARKSThe syntactic elements of the clause are as follows: a predica-tive word, an independent subject, an independent object, a
subject or object modifier, a predicate modifier, a predicate complement, and a sentence connective. Every clause (except one
consisting of a quantificative, 10.21, or an exclamative or imitative,
10.7) must have a predicative word and may consist only of this
word. In addition to a predicative word a clause may contain anyof the remaining syntactic elements (except a subject or object
modifier) or any combination of these (including a subject or object modifier when the modified element is also present). In most
Cases the syntactic elements are words, but subject or object modi-fiersandpredicatecomplementsarewordsor clauses,whilePredicate modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses.
} In this case the predicate modifier consists of two words comprising a postpositional phrase (10:3).",[92]
"All words occurring in phrase-final position appear as pause
forms in accordance with the rules given in 2.43. Words occurring
in phrase-medial position appear as context forms and undergo
changes, when necessary, in accordance with the rules of external
sandhi (2.3).
7.2SuMMARYREMARKSONSYNTACTICSTRUCTUREThe word-classes of Tunica are as follows: independent personal
pronouns, nouns, interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, postpositions, adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, auxiliary
verbs, active verbs, static verbs, sentence connectives, and exclamatives and imitatives.",[88]

"135The Tunica } were always a comparatively small tribe of Indians
but today their numbers are reduced to a mere handful living near
Marksville, Louisiana. Of these there is only one individual, Sesostrie Youchigant (born c. 1870), who speaks the language with any
degree of fluency. He also speaks Louisiana French and English,the former more readily than the latter.","[8, 9]"
"There is, however, an important distinction between thetwo types of verbs: Whereas the subjective element of personificatives refers to a realistic entity (as shown below) which may be
substantivally expressed within the sentence, the subjective element of impersonals refers to a non-realistic or nameless entity

8.3PosirioNALAGREEMENT8.31
In addition to their gender-number classification, the
nouns of Tunica are classified on still another plane, namely, that
of assumed or characteristic position. There are three of these
positions: (1) horizontal, expressed by the auxiliary verb ?u’ra “he
lies,” 4.422; (2) squatting, expressed by the auxiliary verb ?u’na
‘the sits,”’ 4.423; (3) vertical, expressed by the immutable durative
active verb ka’l?ura “he stands’ < ka’li “to stand” + ?u’ra,
4.533. The paradigmatic forms of these three verbs are often used
in situations in which English would use forms of the verb ‘‘to
be,” e.g., in such expressions as “‘there is a, the man’’; “‘there is a,
the dog’’; ‘‘there is a, the tree.”
8.32Inasmuchashumanandquadrupednon-humanmates can assume any of the positions mentioned
positional classification is free, e.g.,
to'niku, ?urd.",[109]
"While there are a fewother Indians who know some isolated words and phrases of Tunica, none of them is familiar enough with the language to converse with Youchigant. In fact Youchigant has had no occasion
to converse in Tunica since the death of his mother in 1915, and,
even before her death, he preferred to speak French to her al-though she always spoke Tunica to him.
Tunica was probably in a more or less decadent state even two
or three generations ago. The reasons for this are obvious. Nearthe end of the nineteenth century the Indian village near Marksville was inhabited by remnants of at least three rapidly dying
tribes: Tunica, Ofo,? and Avoyelles.? To add to the linguistic confusion there were Biloxi? and Choctaw Indians living nearby and
the various groups frequently danced and played ball together.
Since the language of each of these tribes (except the Choctaw)was known to only a few individuals, intertribal communication
was possible only through the medium of the Mobilian jargon °

1911), pp. 306-337.",[9]
"2.232 In the second type of situation requiring vocalic assimilation it is found that whenever the first vowel of an aha or ehe
group changes its quality by contraction with or assimilation to apreceding vowel, the second vowel assumes the identical quality of
the first. Examples:
te'heyaku her brother < ti-, 3Fs pref., + -a’haya sibling of theopposite sex + -ku, Ms suff.
ka’ §?ehe not true < ka’ st true + -?aha not
29’hoyahtt his sister < ?u-, 3Ms pref., + -a’haya + -héi, Fs suff.
la'p?oha not good < la’pu good + -?aha
2o'hokumaku his younger brother < ?u- + -e’hekuma younger
brother of a man (?) 2 + -kuMoreover, in certain grammatical situations an infix is inserted
after the first vowel of an aha or ehe group without preventing the
assimilation of the second vowel, e.g., ?o’nhoyahci their sister <
?u-n-, 3MD pref.,+ -a’haya + -héi.

In the process of combining grammatical elements into
words a vowel which would come to stand before ? is ordinarily

remains a; ¢ after 7, e, a, 0, or u remains 1; u after 1, e, a, 0, or u remains u; 9

inflected for a subjective referential (4.732). Examples:
ta’rustak ?u' Sepa'ni. (14a:h) Rabbit was glad.
sinsto'hk?oke'nt. (4a: ay) They got tired.
10.6SENTENCECONNECTIVESSentence connectives include such words as hinya’tihé ‘‘now,
then, so, after that’’; hz’nahkuhé ‘“‘now, then, so, after that’ (used
interchangeably with hinya’tihé); hi’nahkuskan ‘‘nevertheless,
however, in spite of this, that’’; hz’nahk?ohéat ‘therefore, for this,
that reason’; ka’Sile’he, ka’Slehe ‘“‘forsooth; it turned out that
way”; 2a’/hak?thé “otnerwise, or, or else, or perhaps.”
These
words are used to establish a loose conjunctive or contrastive relation between a sentence and the sentence that precedes it.
Examples:
hinya'tthé, ?u'k?uhke'nt. (48:b) Now he sat down.
hinya'tihé, te’Cak ?uya’nako'nt. (4B:ak) Then Woodpecker spoke
