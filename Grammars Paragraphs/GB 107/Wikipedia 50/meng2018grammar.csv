Polar questions, sometimes referred to in the literature as ‘yes-no questions’, can
be formed from basic verbal and non-verbal clauses by changing the intonation.
The distinguishing criterion is a pitch change located on the last two syllables, with
penultimate syllable rise in pitch, and a slight rise in pitch and elongation of the
last syllable (see §2.4.2.2).

mountain like that, the name of the mountain is Baram.] Then I asked
(about everything) I said, “and people just go up there?”’
[CM-B2-035]
The positive answer of a polar question is formed by either repeating the sentence in an affirmative intonation, or the exclamation ‘mm’, or simply inhaling
with a gesture of lifting one’s head and raising the eyebrows.
The negative answer is usually the negator kori. In the case of answering a
question of asking if one has anything, the negative answer is either kori go and/or
a gesture of twisting one’s hand and shrugging.
3.6.2 Constituent questions
Constituent questions use one of the interrogative proforms as listed in Table 3.6.
All interrogative proforms can be used in situ to replace the requested information in the corresponding declarative sentence, as in 164. Certain interrogative
proforms can also be used at the beginning of the sentence (165).

3PL-QUOT 3PL TOP 3PL-DOWN in valley big‘They said they were down there in the big valley.’[LR-TH-064]3.7 Negation
There is a negator kori in Tulil, which can be used for clausal negation, usually
verbal clauses. Another negative strategy consists of kori NEG and the general
non-specific pronoun go ‘some’, used to negate non-verbal clauses/sub-clausal constituents. kori can also be used with other non-specific pronouns such as gəta
‘someone.SG.CLF:MASC’, gətəm ‘someone.PL.CLF:HUM’ and gəvət
‘somewhere.SG.CLF:SEG’, meaning ‘no one (SG)’, ‘no one (PL)’ and ‘nowhere’.
A general rule is that kori is mostly used for negation of verbal clause/subclausal
constituents, and kori go for negation of non-verbal clause/subclausal constituents,
though atypical cases exist in categorical boundaries. In this section, both clausal
and subclausal negation will be discussed.
The short form ko is also used in fast speech35 .

NEG NSPEC thing 3N.PST-IPFV∼hide‘There was nothing that was hiding (lit: no thing was hiding).’
[AL-GN-004]
One special case is when a nominalized verb used as an argument is also negated
by kori go:

NMLZ∼listen =PAT talk‘We are people who do not listen [lit. people without listening].’
[WM-CM-004]
In the negation of non-verbal clauses with a possessive construction as predicate, the possessive pronoun occurs in between kori and go.

following section).

NEG NSPEC in space/time all

‘Not in all time (that this can grow)’[DV-BL-024]3.7.3 Negation with either strategy
Clauses/constituents that are atypical cases of verbal/non-verbal distinction can
usually use either negation strategy, i.e., they can either be negated by kori, or
kori + non-specific pronoun go. The elements belonging to this category include
impersonal transitive clause, stative intransitive clause, predicative adjectives, purpose clause (no instance found with negation of negative purpose clause ti-) and
the prepositions to ‘belong to’.","[140, 141]"
"158CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSESWhen used as a proform, go has a set of inflected forms, corresponding to different nominal classes. The use of go (and the inflected forms) as non-specific
pronouns in NP is discussed in §5.4, and details of forms can be found in §10.1.1.2,
Table 10.6.
go is compulsory in a negated NP (negation on clausal level), expressing negative
existential.

[LR-TF-018]4.10.5Quotative eThe quotative e can be used either as a complementizer (example 277a, §12.2), or
as a quotative predicator (example 277b).

then 3PL.PST-IPFV∼goThen they said, ’where are they?’ I said, ’they already went, because
I shouted at them and I struggled, so they went.’
[MP-GW-019]4.10. ADVERBS159When used as a complementizer, quotative e usually combines with utterance
and thought verbs such as məngar ‘say’, bokbok ‘talk’ and tən ‘think’. It can also be
used as a predicate itself, implying a real speech or thoughts. For instance, in 277a,
the first e follows the speech verb məngar ‘say’; while in 277b, it constitutes the
predicate. In both cases, e has a defective inflectional pattern (quotative indexes)
that does not reflect tense (§10.1.2.4).
In the production of narrative in Tulil, speakers make extensive use of direct
speech. Direct quotes have the internal syntactic structure of typical clauses and
even multiple sentences. The speaker can not only quote the speech of a person,
but can also mimick with interjections, onomatopoeic expressions, or non-verbal
events.

"12CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONitems that conform to the syntactic pattern of inalienable possession are mostly
body parts and kinships, but not all members of these categories are inalienably
possessed.
Tulil does not have an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the 1st person pronominals. This distinction is often found in Austronesian languages, but is not common in Papuan languages, except East Papuan languages. However, the feature
is not known to be present in Papuan languages in East New Britain (Dunn et al.,
2002:40). Tulil pronominals make a three-way number distinction: singular, dual
and plural.
Tulil has a category of prepositions (Tolai has prepositions and Baining postpositions) with a large set of members, which shows a certain degree of heterogeneity
in terms of morphosyntax (§6).
Concerning the function of demonstratives as spatial deictics, the relative distance may be measured based on the position of the speaker exclusively, or the
speaker and hearer. As pointed out by Foley (1986:75), Papuan languages most
commonly have a deictic system of the first type, ranging from a two-term system
(‘this’ and ‘that’) to more complicated ones with other parameters such as visibility
and elevation, while Austronesian languages usually have a three-way distance distinction (close to speaker, close to hearer, and away from both). Both Mali Baining
(Stebbins, 2011:76-82) and Tolai (Mosel, 1982) in the area seem to have a system
of the first type, with additional parameters pertaining to landscapes, etc. Tulil
uses a combination of the two types, like some other Papuan languages such as
Fore (Scott 1978). Tulil shows a three-way distinction on the distance scale: near
speaker, near hearer, and away from both; on a larger distance scale, other parameters are also involved, such as elevation and specific landmarks such as the sea
(§7).
Verb morphology in Tulil is fairly complex (cf. §9). Multiple stems are involved
in the formation of verbs related to different grammatical categories. Verb morphology involves mainly prefixing, including A/SA person/number/gender/tense
portmanteau prefixes and reduplication (imperfective aspect). Derivational processes include the applicative suffix and incorporation. The morphophonological
pattern of verb inflection in Tulil is not immediately transparent, and involves an
interaction between initial consonant mutation and reduplication of stems (§2.5.5).
Mood in Tulil is marked by adverbial particles.
Tulil has a rather complex nominal classification system, with 11 different nominal classes based on sex, size and shape, usually manifested in NP-related structures, and a smaller system of 3 gender distinctions (masculine, feminine, neuter),
manifested as person indexes on verbs, possessives, etc (§10). Nominal classification has been proposed as a possible distinctive characteristic common to the1.6. THE DATA13non-Austronesian languages of the Bismarck Archipelago, Bougainville, and the
Solomons region (Terrill, 2002), and is not found in any of the Austronesian languages of the area. However, among these languages, only the Baining languages
have a large set of distinctions (Stebbins, 2005, 2011:136-155), similar to what we
find in Tulil.","[43, 44, 45]"

[AL-IP-060]6.4.3.10 mənu ‘back.of’mənu encodes a spatial relationship of posteriority. Depending on the shape of the
object, mənu can mean ‘behind’, usually has the connotation of following (461)54 ;
or ‘on top of; at the back of’ (462).

not the meaning of ‘following’6.5. PREPOSITIONS OF SHARED CATEGORIES(463)də-p∼pi

The prepositions being presented in this section may be used in other word classes
with the same form, such as verbs and subordinators. Subordinators that are used
as prepositions usually do not behave exactly like prototypical prepositions.

6.5.2 Purposive da and negative purposive ti
Purposive da and negative purposive ti are commonly used to introduce independent or subordinate clause (12.1.2.1). When used as prepositions, they have the
meanings of ‘for’ and ‘afraid of’. They are not prototypical prepositions. For instance, ti does not take patientive pronoun as the complement:
(469)iaor nging ti
iap.
afraid 2SG LEST 3SG.M‘You are afraid of him.’
(470)lang-mə
ngang da
go
ioi.
want-APPL 1SG PURP NSPEC water
‘I want some water.’[AL-HD-052][E]6.5.3 to ‘of’
to ‘of’ can link two NPs, bearing a function similar to the English preposition of: it
identifies the NP after it as a modifying element in relationship to the NP before
it, with the most common function being possession (471a), in which case the toconstruction can be used in alternation with the possessive construction (cf. §5.8).
In 471b, the two NPs linked by to have another type of relationship, where the6.5. PREPOSITIONS OF SHARED CATEGORIES235second NP describes a property of the first one (‘a time of darkness’). The same
form is also used as a general subordinator (§12.1.2.2), leading various types of
subordinate clauses55 .

[AL-HD-004]
When to is used as a preposition, it can be optionally indexed like other prepositions. However the forms of indexes used in this case are different from indexes on
other prepositions (cf.§4.7.7). It is difficult to identify whether the index is present
or not, when the modified NPs have SG.MASC/FEM class markings a/e: in this case,
the index of to have the same form a/e with the nominal class markings, and the
vowel deletion rule in hiatus (§2.5.1) delete one of the vowels in this case (for
instance: /maoka/ + /ato/ → /maokato/). However, when the person index is 3
neuter singular (unspecified gender), it is optional (present in 472b and omitted in
472a):

"11.2. TYPES OF COORDINATION359In a conjunctive relation, two or more coordinands are connected in a sentence,
without specifying the semantic relationship between them. Different interpretations arise as implicature of the contexts.
Conjunction can be either symmetric (the order of coordinands are interchangable)
or asymmetric (the order of coordinands are not interchangable). In the latter case,
different orders of coordinands convey different meanings. No asymmetrical cases
are found in the corpus when both coordinands are phrases.
11.2.1.1 Symmetrical conjunctionThe conjunctive construction can be symmetric, which means the coordinands can
be reversed without a change of meaning. Conjunction of phrases is only found to
be symmetric, while conjunction of clauses can be either symmetric or asymmetric.
Symmetrical conjunctions are expressed by means of juxtaposition or coordinator me, and the latter is most commonly used. Juxtaposition of phrases is always
symmetric, however, juxtaposition of clauses are commonly temporal/consecutive
(will be discussed later).

each.other’ in a possessive construction, forming an idiomatic expression that describes the reciprocal relationship between participants76 .

a contrastive reading.
me is quite often used when an adversative interpretation can be applied. In
this case, me can express either 1) a denial of an expectation (725a), or 2) the contrast between a negative and positive expression (725b). This is called substitutive
adversative coordination by Haspelmath (2007:28).

11.2.1.3 Temporal conjunctionConjunctive constructions describing temporal relations are asymmetric: the orders
of coordinands convey the temporal sequence of the events. Temporal conjunction
can be expressed by juxtaposition; coordinator me; io and topicalizer o.","[390, 391, 392, 393]"

Another case is the incorporation/deletion of nasals. In Tulil, the nasal series
do not cooccur with prenasalized voiced stops of the same place (*/mb/, */nd/,
*/ŋg/) (cf.§2.1.3). Thus when a nasal + voiced stop cluster of the same place in
the source language is adapted into Tulil, the nasals are deleted phonemically (e.g.
sande > a-tade ‘sunday; week; church; worship’). Also, nasals before voiceless
stops are incorporated into the stop and change it to a voiced one (e.g. monki >
a-mogi ‘monkey’). Even though the surface form usually still has a nasal element
due to the prenasalization, these nasals can be inaudible or not pronounced at all
according to speakers.

There are several types of vowel change:1) /a/ changes to /o/ in some cases (rules not clear): e.g. kaukau > a-koukou
‘sweet potato’; tapiok > a-topiok ‘tapiok(cassava)’.
2) /i/ changes to /e/ in some cases (rules not clear): e.g. misinari > a-misinare
‘missionary’; pamkin > a-pamken ‘pumpkin’.

As discussed in §2.3, there are some co-occurence restrictions in Tulil concerning
consonant clusters, which are not permitted inside a syllable (except when the medial is an approximant). Thus a loanword with consonant clusters inside a syllable
requires the insertion of a vowel, with the following cases:
1) The inserted vowel is a copy of the next vowel in the sequence, such as:
(40) trosel → a-torotel/a-torosel ‘turtle’
glas → a-galat ‘glass(es)’
2) The inserted vowel surfaces as a schwa in unstressed syllable (in fast speech):
(41) trausis → a-tarautet or a-tərautet ‘trousers’
The above example can have two possible output. In the first case, it should
also be noted here that only the first vowel is copied even when the original sound
is a vowel sequence.
3) An /i/ is inserted between /s/ and /t/ in the source word (/s/ is also adapted
to /t/).
(42) stoa → a-tito ‘store’.

This chapter presents an overview of the clause structure of Tulil. Following an
introduction of clause structure in §3.1, two types of clauses in Tulil are described:
verbal clauses (§3.2) and non-verbal clauses (§3.3). Functions of different clauses
are discussed briefly in §3.1.2 and extensively in §3.4. Both types of clauses can
combine with negator and interrogative words to form negative utterances (§3.6)
and questions (§3.7).","[78, 79, 80, 81]"

apprehensional-epistemic functions. The latter is defined in Lichtenberk (1995)
as related to the LEST element, expressing modality that is both epistemic (the
speaker’s uncertainty about the factual status of a proposition) and attitudinal (the
apprehensional attitude concerning the situation encoded in the sentence). According to him, this is a case of mixed modality rather than polysemy.

In a sentence like 290b, the speaker shows apprehension towards a potential undesirable situation that is likely to happen. ti can also be used mainly for expressing
epistemic uncertainty, usually in a question, with slight attitude of apprehension.
For instance, in 291a, the alternative indicated by the clause following ti is ‘she (the4.11. PARTICLES167torch) dies’ (the battery runs out), and in 291b is ‘he (the crocodile) is still alive’
(it is still dangerous). In both cases, it is the undesired alternative that follows ti.

the two propositions in the avertive function, but not in the in-case function. So
we can see in in contrast, for example, in 294a, hiding in the bush prevents the
two to be found by Namugi, while in 294b, the fact that young men and women go

Traditionally, a simple dichonomy between coordination and subordination is drawn
between terms of clause combining strategies: conjuncts have equal grammatical
status in coordinate constructions, while subordinates have unequal status in the
subordinate constructions. Formally, the distinction is usually based on criteria
such as dependency (the subordinate clause is dependent on the main clause) and
clausal embedding (the subordinate clause takes on a syntactic function in the
main clause) (cf. Lyons, 1968:178 and Haspelmath 1995).","[400, 401, 402, 403]"
"2.3PhonotacticsThe phonotactic formula of a syllable in Tulil is:
σ → (C)(C)V(C)
This means that Tulil allows the following six syllable types: V, CV, VC, CVC, CCV,
CCVC (examples can be found in Table 2.8).
Roots consist of one or more syllables. Five syllables seems to be the limit
for root morphemes: one example is found and it is an ideophone (/kələkələŋər/
‘shining’).

2.4.1 Stress
Stress is not contrastively utilized in Tulil words. Note that the stress analysis
given here is very preliminary and only based on auditory impression thus far, and
Tulil may not be a language that takes word-level stress as a prominent feature
as languages like English (cf. Goedemans & van Zanten, 2014). Most Tulil words
have their stress on the last syllables, signalled by a combination of slightly higher
intensity, lengthening of the vowel and (possibly) vowel quality. Pitch is not a
predictable indicator of stress: words in isolation commonly have a higher pitch
in the first syllable, while in a sentence the last syllable of a word can get a higher
pitch. However, the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables in regard
to all these variables is not very prominent, and is subject to the position in an
intonation contour. Affixation and cliticization do not change the placement of
stress, thus a noun root such as /kə""gor/ ‘eel’, after encliticization of the nominal
class marking, still has its stress on the penultimate syllable /kə""gora/ ‘a eel’. To
give a more precise description of the manifestation of these variables, a detailed
instrumental analysis will need to be carried out in future studies.
2.4.2 Intonation
Pitch contours of basic Tulil sentences are described in this section, including intonation of declarative sentences, polar questions and constituent questions.
2.4.2.1 Declarative sentenceSimple declarative clauses (both verbal and non-verbal) show a peak on one or
more stressed constituents of the sentence, and gradually fall after the last peak
towards the end of the sentence across the last syllables. There is (at least) one28CHAPTER 2. PHONOLOGYpitch peak before the intonation drops. The pitch contours of a verbal clause can
be seen in Figure 2.6 and that of a non-verbal clause is shown in Figure 2.7. In the
first sentence, the highest pitch is the beginning of the verb (person index), and a
smaller peak at the beginning of the particle konəng ‘only’. In the second one, the
highest peak is the subject ttia ‘dad’ and another rise when the second NP occurs.
The general tendency of the pitch contours of both sentences are falling towards
the end of the utterance.

Time (s)In a complex declarative sentence, the intonation of the last constituents of each
clause shows a falling-rising pattern, except for the last sentence (see Figure 2.8a
to 2.8c).
2.4.2.2QuestionsThe pitch range is generally higher in questions, especially in polar questions. We
can see the frame of pitch in Figure 2.6 to 2.8c is 60-240Hz for declarative sentences, while for polar questions it is 120-300Hz (Figure 2.11), in order to position
the pitch figures in the middle of the frame.
For constituent questions, there is a slight rise-falling pattern on the question
word, otherwise the general tendency of the sentence is falling, similar to declarative sentences. Figure 2.9 shows a constituent question with the question word2.4. SUPRASEGMENTAL FEATURES29Figure 2.7: Declarative sentence: non-verbal240Pitch (Hz)210

Time (s)Intonation is the only cue to distinguish a declarative sentence from a polar
question. Polar questions (Figure 2.11) also show a steep rise and fall on the last
word of the utterance, where the rising may form the highest peak of the whole
sentence, and the falling end point is still higher compared to other part of the
utterance, differing from both declaratives and constituent questions, where the
end point of the sentence always shows a low point in the whole sentence.
If the question offers alternatives, as in Figure 2.12, there is usually a peak on
the first alternative, and falling towards the end of the utterance.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]"
"8.4. FLAGGING AND SERIAL VERBS289(B) accommodate a THEME.
We have seen from earlier discussions (cf. §8.3) that verbal adjuncts inside the
VC cannot precede an argument directly and has to be followed by a slot 3 element
when the VC still asks for an argument. In this case, the patient-like argument of
the transitive verb is usually preceded by applicative n:

3PL.PST-buy finish APPL
PL.CLF:DIM‘The teachers bought the bananas, they bought all of them.’
[ML-YE-039]This use of n also quite commonly occurs with stative intransitive verbs or impersonal transitive verbs, given that the argument following VC is the sole argument
for these verbs, and thus is obligatory in the VC, when there is a verbal adjunct
present:

‘He hid his head, then he went home.’[TV-CC-017]8.4.3 Serial verbs
Verb serialization refers to “the juxtaposition of two or more verbs, each of which
would also be able to form a sentence of its own”, defined by Bisang (1996:533). I
adopt the following criteria in identifying serialization in Tulil (adapted from Durie
1997:291):
1)The serial verbs make up the predicate of a single clause, with no clause
boundary or dependency marker in between;2)constitute one single prosodic entity, without pause;3)share the same tense and aspect, marked on the V1 ; share mood, polarity,
marked by particles which have scope over the involved verbs.66. as defined by Dixon as ‘a construction involving the specification of an additional argument, a causer onto
a basic clause’ (Dixon, 2000:30).","[320, 321, 322]"
"3.1. INTRODUCTION55verbal clauses, and will be discussed in §3.4. Reduplication and Negation are
two diagnostic features concerning the distinction of verbal and non-verbal clause.
We can see that the more prototypical verbal clauses such as (di)transitive and
active intransitive clauses and prototypical nominal clauses show consistent and
unambiguous features on these two aspects, while impersonal clauses, stativeintransitive clause and locative clauses are less verbal-like, yet not fully nominal
clauses.
Reduplication is only used in verb clauses (cf. §9 verb morphology), and never
occurs in non-verbal clauses. In transitive/active-intransitive clauses, reduplication encodes imperfective aspect (continuative, habitual) in both past (51a) and
non-past tenses (51b). Impersonal clauses have no perfective forms but only imperfective forms (52). In stative-intransitive clauses, reduplication encodes intensity (53a) and continuation (53b). Locative clause as a special case of intransitive
clause, does not involve reduplication forms.

[AL-RM-094]Verbal predicates in transitive (excluding impersonal clauses) and ditransitive
clauses are negated by the negator kori, immediately before the verb complex (54a),
while a non-verbal predicate, especially NP predicate, is typically negated by the
negator kori + non-specific pronoun go (54b).

[AL-DL-012]Other verbal predicates such as those occurring in impersonal clauses (55),
stative-intransitive clauses (56) and locative clauses (57) can be negated with either
the NSPEC go (55b, 56b, 57b; same as non-verbal predicates) or without it (55a,
56a, 57a; same as predicates in transitive clauses). This suggests that both impersonal transitive and stative intransitive clauses are less typical verbal clauses
comparing to clauses with a PTV as the head of the predicate.

Certain adverbial predicates are also found to be negated without go (such as

[ER-EA-010]3.1.4 Full structure of clauses
The structure of clauses in Tulil is shown in Figure 3.2 and 3.3. Pre-predicate elements and adjuncts are similar in verbal and non-verbal clauses, including particles
that are commonly verbal operators in other languages. These constituents include irrealis ka/aka/dame (§4.11.1), iamitive perfect bə (§4.11.2), purposive da
(§4.11.3) and negation kori/ko (§3.6). Most of these particles can occur on most
structural levels inside a sentence, and the structures shown in Figure 3.2 and 3.3
only represent these particles when they have a scope over the predicates. Details
of these elements can be found in the word class chapter (§4). Several examples
of co-occurring possibilities of these elements in verbal and non-verbal clauses are
shown in examples 59 to 63.

consists of a predicate and one or more arguments, which bear specific semantic
relations to the predicate. The grammatical function S is treated the same as either
A when used the subject of active-intransitive verb, or as P when used as the subject
of stative-intransitive verb).

(ADV.DEM) (PP)3.2.1 Coding of arguments
Argument functions are marked by 1) person indexing by pronominal prefixes; 2)
constituent order; 3) patientive case (case marker on nouns/patientive forms of personal pronouns). Oblique arguments are marked by the combination of patientive
marking and oblique marking (prepositions or applicative).
The following example illustrates the structure of the PTV verb man ‘remove’.

3PL.PST-remove
=PAT tree
u-vi
to kəməron=ta
]P
3N-PROXS of different=PL.CLF:HUM‘My uncles removed these trees belonging to people from other tribes.’
[SV-N1-147]
In this example, the A argument is indexed by the prefix tə-, encoding person
(3rd), number (PL), nominal class (HUMAN) and tense (PST). The P argument NP
‘these trees belong to people from other tribes’ is accompanied by the patientive
case marker =a, as a detached clitic that is attached to the preceding element,
which in this case a verb.
3.2.1.1 Person indexingA/SA arguments are indexed on the verb by pronominal prefixes, specifying the
person, number, gender of the argument, as well as tense (tense is lacking in some62CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTUREspecial cases, such as locative structures, §3.2.2.4). There are two sets of prefixes
distinguishing past (PST) and non-past (NPST) (see §10.1.2.1 for all the forms).
Person indexes are obligatory on verbs, while NPs as the indexed arguments
are optional if they are recoverable from the context. As shown in the following
examples, the verb mume ‘tell’ is preceded by a full NP as the A argument in 66b,
but not in 66a; while in both sentences, person indexes are present:
(66) a. və∼mume

SR PURP 1SG.PST-swear‘The elders taught me words for me to swear.’[WM-LB-008]Person indexing appears in both transitive and active-intransitive clauses. As
shown in the following examples, the verb manəng is used both as transitive ‘chase’
(67a) and intransitive ‘run’ (67b), and both are prefixed by person markings.
(67) a. Transitive

3SG.M.POSS.INAL= bottom‘I ran and jumped onto the trunk of the tree.’[DV-HP-056]In impersonal clauses, only the third person neuter prefixes idə- (PST) and it(NPST) are used, and they do not cross-reference any arguments (dummy arguments). Thus the person indexes in transitive impersonal clauses only represent
the tense of the predicate, but not person or gender. In example 68, the transitive
impersonal verb tu ‘become.fat’ are used with both the PST and NPST forms of the
person marking.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"

Demonstratives are defined by Himmelmann in terms of the following two characteristics Himmelmann (1996:210): firstly, an element must be in a paradigmatic
relation to elements which locate the entity referred to on a distance scale when
used exophorically; secondly, the element should not be amenable to uses which
are characteristic of definite articles.
This definition expands the functional class of demonstratives to include not
only the basic ones that make reference to locations on a distance scale (proximal,
distal, etc.), but also spatial reference terms that are not distance-based (e.g. elevation, landforms), usually defined as a separate class called ‘directionals’ in other
grammars (cf. Hyslop, 2001; Stebbins, 2011). In Tulil, these geocentric forms have
the same morphological and distributional properties as the basic demonstratives
(like ‘this’ and ‘that’), and they can entail participant- and distance-oriented uses
in both cases where a speaker/addressee is involved (e.g. down there from where
the speaker is standing) or not (e.g. down there where another object/person in
the narrative is standing).
On the other hand, the definition excludes spatial deictics that are in themselves
adverbs, such as do ‘here; now’. Another specification that one can add to the
definition of demonstrative in Tulil is that the primary use of demonstratives is
nominal. This means, all demonstrative s can be used adnominally, co-occurring
with nouns (Table 7.2). The necessity of including this point lies in the fact that
there are cases like the restrictive verb vəde ‘(come) this way (towards self)’, which
has spatial deictic function, and can be used predicatively (480a) and adverbially
(480b), but cannot be used nominally/pronominally. A full list of demonstrative
stems is shown in Table 7.1 (the original meaning of each term is bolded).

[WM-JJ-018]The function of demonstratives as spatial deictics, the relative distance may
be measured based on the position of the speaker exclusively, or the speaker and
hearer. As pointed out by Foley (1986:75), Papuan languages most commonly have
a deictic system of the first type, ranging from a two-term system (‘this’ and ‘that’)
to more complicated ones with other parameters such as visibility and elevation,
while Austronesian languages usually have a three-way distance distinction (close
to speaker, close to hearer, and away from both). Both other languages of the
area, Mali Baining (Stebbins, 2011:76-82) and Tolai (Mosel, 1982) have a system
of the first type, with additional parameters concerning landscapes, etc. Tulil uses7.1. MORPHOLOGY OF DEMONSTRATIVES243a combination of the two types, similar to some Papuan languages such as Fore
(Scott, 1978:82). In Tulil, there is a three-way distinction on the distance scale:
near speaker, near hearer, and away from both; on a larger distance scale, other
parameters are also involved, such as elevation and landscape. The semantics of
the spatial deictic use of demonstratives will be discussed in §7.2.
In addition to their primary use as exophoric deixis to refer to an element that
is external to the text (spatial deictics, temporal deictics, etc.), demonstratives have
a range of endophoric functions as well to make text-internal references (Halliday
& Hasan, 1976:57-76). The endophoric use is subdivided into the (i) anaphoric,
(ii) discourse deictic, and (iii) recognitional uses, following Himmelmann (1997).","[269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"However, it is recognized in cross-linguistic studies that neither the distinction
between subordination/coordination nor the one between embedding and hypotaxis is a clear-cut one, but rather a syntactic continuum involving a number of
independent parameters (Lehmann, 1988; Givón, 1990).
In Tulil, all three types of subordinate clauses can be identified:(746) Complement clause

of the traditional criteria of dependency and embedding. In Tulil, the following
strategies of subordination and embedding are involved in subordinate clause formation:
(A) Special verb form: Nominalized verbs (gerundive)
(B) Subordinating morphemes:
(a) morphemes with no lexical meaning: to general subordinator;(b) morphemes with lexical meaning: doto ‘when/if’; mata ‘until
(time)’; tove ‘because’; da (purpose) ti (negative purpose/in-case);
kati (counterfactual condition); ka;
(c) use of topic markers as separator of subordinate clause and main
clauses (after subordinate clause and preceding main clause).
12.1.1Inner structure of subordinate clauseThere are generally two types of subordinate clause with regards to their inner
structure: nominalized clause and sentential clause. A nominalized clause is used12.1. FORMS OF SUBORDINATION373in complementation, such as the complement of the verb təm ‘know’ (see §12.2
for details use of nominalization as complementation). Nominalized predicates in
complement clauses lack person indexes, and can use a genitive construction to include the A/S argument, such as idə ‘3N.POSS.AL’ in 749b and ngi ‘2SG.POSS.AL’ in
749c, with the nominalized predicate as head. O/SO arguments follow the nominalized verbs, and patientive marking =a is used when applicable. Morphologically,
the verb in a nominalized complement usually has one of the reduplicative patterns
(the gerundive verb form, see §9.2.2).

full clauses with person indexes, and can be used for all types of subordinate clauses
12.1.2 Subordinating morphemes
Subordinating morphemes are of different natures, taking various syntactic slots,
and combining with each other when forming complex sentences. Morphemes like
to usually occur at the left-most slot in a subordinate clause (coordinators me and
ba also fit into this slot78 , see §11), while da PURP occur in the slot that is closest
to the clause (probably clause internal).
78. Even though the subordinator to cannot co-occur with tove ‘because’, the coordinators can precede it.
Other collocation restrictions that cannot be reflected in 750 is that kati cannot cooccur with da or ti.","[403, 404, 405]"

intermarried into the Baining group and the outcome was a wordlist, and grammatical notes. Cindy Schneider also collected several texts (comprising 51mins of
recordings). Tulil language consultant Louise Gulua and Maria Rickie collected
several stories from the speakers, and compiled a story book, with no recordings.","[39, 40]"

[DV-BL-008]The interpretation of CTVs also depends on coreferencing between the main
clause and the complement clause. For instance, the two examples in (781) both
involve the verb məngar ‘say’ and the morpheme da expressing desiderative. In
(781a), when the addressee is the same as the subject of the complement clause,
məngar means ‘tell someone to do’ and expresses manipulative meanings such as order/advice; while in (781b), when the subjects of the main clause and complement
clause are the same, məngar simply describes the utterance event, which includes
the will of the subject. As suggested by Hansen et al. (2016:183), this difference in
meaning is ‘not from strict syntactic rules, but rather from the issues of volitionality
and the capability of the agent to influence the state of affairs’.(781) a. ngi-nəngar

[SV-BE-032]12.2.1Classes of complement-taking verbsTulil has seven different classes of complement-taking verbs, according to the semantic classes of CTVs defined in Noonan (2007), as shown in Table 12.2. Also
there are adjectives/nouns that can take complements, such as mərek ‘be good’
(positive evaluation).
Certain verbs can be used in more than one semantic classes (marked by subscripts of numbers), and the different uses are associated with the choice of complementizers, as discussed in the section above. The complementizers commonly
associated with each CTV is also shown in Table 12.2.","[420, 421, 422]"
"[E]The elicited type II nominal clause in (123b) shows another way to express the
attributive reading ‘the sun was big’. The attributive interpretation of the existential clause can be seen clearly from example (124), where the noun root is more
abstract.

cold big=SG.CLF:FEM
SR fog
big LOC-UP‘It was very cold (lit: there was big coldness) because the fog was big up
there.’
[CM-B2-074]It is clearly shown that the phrase bərbər laike ‘big coldness’ is an NP, given that
class/number marking is marked at the end of the NP (cf. §5). A similar example
is shown by a noun of property used in a possessive NP:
(125)tivən=e

ve
təməng laik=a.
rock=SG.CLF:FEM 3SG.M-PROXS 3SG.F.POSS.AL heavy big=SG.CLF:MASC
‘This rock is very heavy (lit. this rock’s heaviness).’[E]A type II nominal clause is the most common way to express class membership
and property. When the subject is human, type III clauses can also fulfil these
functions, given its restrictive use for human subjects (cf. §3.3.2). When a property
word is involved in the predicative NP, both types of clauses can express property
meaning. The structural difference between the two clauses is discussed in §3.3.2.
The functional difference is that type II nominal clauses tend to sit closer to the90CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE‘class membership’ end and type III nominal clauses to the ‘property’ end of the
continuum.
There are two types of closely-related functions expressed by type III clauses,
related to its tendency to express property: firstly, it assigns a single property to the
entity (usually involves an adjective in the NP, such as ləm ‘young’ in 126), rather
than categorizing the entity. The adjective ləm ‘young’ here designates a specific
property rather than defines a category ‘young man’, because it can be modified
by degree modifiers such as moli ‘really’ in this case.

‘two really young men’[E]Secondly, when expressing class membership, it designates the prototypical set
of properties related to the members of a certain class (‘feature bundles’ as in Wierzbicka 1986, e.g. possessing property of ‘devil’ or ‘Tulil people’ in 127) and emphasizes its relevance to the contexts. For instance, the difference between 128a
and 128b is that the latter tend to (but not necessarily) assert and emphasize that
“I” possess the property of prototypical ‘males’ such as braveness in the context of
128b, while type II nominal clauses usually do not have this interpretation. In the
context of example 128c, the speaker was emphasizing the fact that because ‘I’ was
a boy (possess the sexuality of ‘male’) in contrast with being a girl, so ‘my’ mum
wanted to kill ‘me’ when ‘I’ was born.

[LR-TH-004]This certain property of the class membership is usually emphasized, due to a
specific reason that is indicated in other parts of the sentence. In the same sense of
what has been shown for the contrast in 128, 129 shows a case where an emphasis
of ‘family relationship’ is crucial for ‘you’ not ’to be killed’.

This difference can be seen in a more extreme example, with a predicative NP
that assigns the noun root lok ‘man’ into the feminine nominal class. The first
sentence is strange because it is not culturally salient to acknowledge a category of
‘manly woman’. The same predicate is acceptable in the structure of 130b, where
the use of the predicate is to assign the prototypical man property to a female:92CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE(130) a. ? nging o

‘You are a man-like girl.’[E]Another example is shown in 131, where the predication does not assign the
subject into the class of ‘white men’ in the sense that he can actually belong to
the ethnic group, which would be contradicting reality, but emphasizing the stereotypical properties of this group perceived from the local people’s view, such as
‘wearing trousers instead of laplap’, or ‘not working (in the gardens)’.

[ER-EA-016]The functional difference between type II and type III nominal classes when
denoting properties echos the observation on difference of class predicates and
property predicates such as ‘Irishman’ and ‘Irish’ in English, where the former refers
to kinds by denoting a complex of properties, while the latter denotes one specific
feature (ethnicity) (Wierzbicka, 1986; Frawley, 1992).
3.4.2 State
Stative-intransitive clauses and impersonal clauses are mostly used to encode states.
Adjectives can be used in both stative-intransitive clauses and nominal clauses denoting properties. A difference in time stability can be seen from the following
examples, where in 132a the color word put ‘red’ is an intrinsic characteristic of
the subject referent, while in 132b it is a temporary state that is subject to change:
(132) a. e-vi
a-vuimilət

vətə o
put.
3SG.F-PROXH ART-pitpit.sp. TOP 3SG.F.POSS.AL skin TOP red

=PAT 3SG.M.POSS.AL.eye=DL.CLF:MASC‘He was vomiting water there, and his eyes were/became red.’
[AK-FH-019]However, the difference between the two clauses is not a sharp one, but a
tendency, given that cases when stative-intransitive predicates encode more stable
property can sometimes be found. For instance in 133, 133a shows that the adjective mədən ‘straight; smooth’ can be used to modify nouns in an NP, and in 133b,
it is used as a state-intransitive predicate, and denoting a property that is not subject to change. Likewise, the adjective mərek ‘good’ is being used in two different
constructions (134).

[SV-BE-057]On the other hand, there are nouns that can indicate states, and be used as
predicates in a nominal clause. In this case, the sentence structure differs from the94CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTUREstructure of a prototypical nominal clause so that the two NPs are simply related as
a topic-comment construction. For instance, in 135a, the literal translation would
look like ‘You, anger?’ Unlike adjectives, the noun kədikən=e ‘anger’ is a noun
with its intrinsic nominal class (feminine) that is not affected by the class of the
referent (135b and 135c show the noun being used as head of the NP arguments).

Predicates involving PPs and demonstratives are usually used to encode locational
predicates. The locational strategy can be verbal (locative clause) and non-verbal.
In both cases, demonstrative predicates are most commonly used, while PP predicates are quite rare. Within demonstrative predicates, the verbal strategy is more
natural than the non-verbal strategy. A difference in function is that the verbal
strategy usually locates an entity (136a), while the non-verbal clause indicate the
location of a place (136b).
(136) a. to-Petro

Malira here (Same place names).’
[KM-TH-050]
Also, locative clauses are quite often used to denote the event of movement /
direction.
3.4.4 Possession
Predicative possession can be classified into two types depending on the topicality
of the possessor and possessed NPs: indefinite predicative possession (when the
possessor NP is the topic, with a meaning such as ‘someone has something’) and
definite predicative possession (when the possessed NP is the topic, with a meaning
such as ‘something belongs to someone’) (Stassen, 2009:28).
In Tulil, indefinite predicative possession is encoded by verbal or non-verbal
strategies in two types of construction:
1) verbal (locative clause). The subject NP is an adnominal possessive construction, with the possessive pronoun and the non-specific pronoun go ‘some’. The
predicate is a demonstrative with person index, indicating existence.

NSPEC eel big=SG.CLF:MASC 3SG.M-PROXH
‘We will have big meat, a big eel.’[AK-FH-012]2) Non-verbal: type I nominal clause, using an NP of adnominal possessive construction as an existential predicate.

"140CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSESWhen functioning as A/SA arguments, the personal pronouns are optional while
verbal indexes are obligatory, as shown in example (235a), where von is a 3rd
person diminutive pronoun. In the first clause, it functions as the SA argument
and the topic, while in the second clause, no personal pronoun is present. On
the other hand, in both clauses, the verbal index idə- (third person neuter; PST) is
compulsory. udu 1PL and ngən 2PL are also personal pronouns in 235b.

[AL-IP-038]
All non-A/SA arguments such as O/SO arguments or objects of prepositions use
the patientive pronominal forms, they differ from A/SA pronominals in 3rd person
singular forms: =a 3SG.M and =e 3SG.F vs. iap 3SG.M and iep 3SG.F. Phonologically, the former forms are clitics. The proforms in non-A/SA positions do not take
the patientive marker =a. Also, given that there are no bound pronouns (affixes)
co-referencing O/SO , personal pronouns in this position carry the main function of
denoting speech roles, and are not optional.

[AL-BT-010]4.7. PRONOMINALS141Free personal proforms can belong to either gender or nominal class system,
detailed discussion can be found in §10.1.4.
4.7.2 Non-specific pronouns
The non-specific go ‘some’, apart from being a pre-nominal modifier in the NP, can
also function as a pronoun, often found in negative and non-specific contexts. NPs
headed by non-specific pronouns are discussed in §5.4, and when functioning in
non-A/SA positions, the NPs headed by non-specific pronouns have to be marked
by patientive marker =a.

2SG.NPST-shake off =PAT NSPEC give 1SG
‘You shake off some (fruits) to give me.’[LR-HC-006]When functioning as a pronoun, go is inflected according to the nominal class
(eg. full paradigm see §10.1.1.2). The same form go as interrogative proform ‘who’
inflects only for gender and has a different inflectional pattern (for instance gət-a
for non-specific pronoun and guria for interrogative proform in masculine class,
§3.6.2). Examples show some inflected non-specific pronouns in different classes,
and the used of non-specific pronouns with negator kori:

The reciprocal/reflexive pronoun tang is used to express reciprocity and reflexivity,
and can be used as O/SO argument (239) or complement of preposition (240). It
cannot be modified by anything, and is not preceded by patientive marker =a.","[171, 172, 173]"

[AL-HD-022]Different from other two types of prepositions, when used as verb-like predicate,
these phrases do not need to take applicative marker to accommodate an argument.
51. This complex PP has to be differentiated from the case when an adverbial element is used to modify the
verb, the applicative marker n will be added between this adverb and the following argument, see §6.4.3.1210CHAPTER 6. PREPOSITIONSIn this sense, they behave more like verbs compared to type I/II prepositions. However, they are not true verbs, given that they only take person indexes that are used
with prepositions (one set instead of two sets as with verbs, PST vs NPST, cf.§8.3).

"[PO]1604.11CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSESParticlesThe following sections provide an overview of the common particles. Particles
in Tulil are those words that can occur in multiple syntactic positions (such as
iamitive bə, emphatic konəng). However, this section also includes elements that
are difficult to define within the scope of current study.
4.11.1ConjunctionsConjunctions include coordinators and subordinators. Both types can be the first
elements of the following clause, or of an independent clause. Coordinators are
discussed in detail in §11.1.2, and subordinators in §12.1.2. da and ti is discussed
in further details in §4.11.3

For instance, doto,
tove, kati, dame seem to be historically related to simplex forms of particles (e.g.
doto = do ‘here/now’ + to SR), though the meaning is semantically opaque.
4.11.2 bə iamitive perfect
The iamitive perfect proclitic bə occur before most types of elements to add aspectual connotations. It can have scope over clauses (examples in 281), and phrase-4.11. PARTICLES161level constituents (such as NPs, adjectives, demonstratives and frame-setting adverbials, examples in 282). When preceding elements starting with vowels, the
allomorph b is used, such as idə 3N.PST (281a) (but not semi-vowels /j/ (i) or /w/
(u), e.g. b before i- 3SG.F.PST but not iu-/ju/ 2DL.NPST). However, bə can be occasionally found to be used instead of b (such as in 281b, compare with 283), this may
relate to the scope of the particle, or pragmatic functions, and further investigation
needs to be carried out on this issue.

The particles da and ti can be used on different levels of the grammar, expressing
desiderative (‘want (to)’) / purposive (‘in order to’), and apprehension (avoid or
fear, ‘lest’) / uncertainty. The syntactic use of these two morphemes are very similar: they can be used as prepositions (usually inside a VC), modality morphemes
in independent clauses, subordinate morphemes in complement clauses (only da)
or adverbial clauses, and marking hypothetical possibilities in questions (only ti).

[CM-B2-035]
In (708), the woman has already asked her husband exactly the same question, but he did not reply, so she asked again with məie introducing the sentence.
While in (709), the quoted question intends to add more understanding about the
mountain that “we” have already talked about, which is the question, “do people
go up there?” In both cases, the coordinators are conversation starters that build
connection to the former contexts.
There is no clear boundary between membership of the coordinator category,
and other linking elements belonging to the preposition or adverb categories. Coordinators in Tulil typically include me ‘and’, ba ‘or’, məie ‘but’. Other conjunctions
involved in expressing coordination include discourse connective (io ‘and then, so’)
and topicalizer o.
11.1.3CoordinandsIn Tulil, the coordinands can be phrases (NP, PP) or clauses. It is possible to have
binary coordination (two coordinands in a coordinate structure, as in 710), as well
as multiple coordination (more than two coordinands in a coordinate structure).
Only me ‘and’ (711a) and ba ‘or’ (711b), but not məie ‘but’, can be used in multiple
coordination.","[385, 386]"

[AK-FH-019]Non-predicational clauses such as existential and identificational will also be

3.1.3 Form and meaning correlation
In the previous section basic functions of clause types were discussed. Different
semantic categories are roughly reflected24 in the basic clause types, and will be
discussed in detailed in §3.4. Figure 3.1 shows a mapping between predicate types
and the semantic predicate categories. Dotted lines show that the clause type plays
a minor role in expressing the relevant semantic types (special cases). Other functions such as existential are not shown on the mapping.
Different types of clauses and their features are summarized in Table 3.1. The
table shows clearly the difference between verbal and non-verbal clauses. The
various types of clauses are exemplified by the following sentences and will be
further elaborated in the following sections.
A more detailed description of form-meaning correlation is given in the form
of a feature table. It is often observed that the basic clause types show gradient
24. For instance, when a iamitive marker b occurs in a non-verbal clause, the clause expresses a change of
state, and could be seen as a type of event. This is not taken into consideration here.","[84, 85]"
"68CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTUREintransitive, featuring person markings that do not designate a substantial A or SA
argument, and instead represent a non-referential (dummy) argument. Morphologically, the person indexes of A/SA arguments used in a impersonal construction are
restricted to 3rd person neuter prefixes, with the distinction of tense (idə- 3N.PST,
iT- 3N.NPST) retained. This means that comparing to A/SA arguments of other
transitive verbs, the parameter lost in the grammatical A/SA argument in this case
is the person and number distinction. Also, the impersonal verbs only have imperfective aspect forms, represented by reduplication (details of verb morphology can
be found in §9). The morphosyntactic property of P argument is not affected when
the clause is transitive, and this P argument becomes the ‘notional subject’.

1PL‘We were not fat, because now we are eating good food and getting
fat.’
[JK-PP-004]
In the above examples of transitive impersonal clauses, the A arguments being
indexed by the 3rd person neuter prefixes idə- and iT- are all non-referential. For
instance, it is quite unlikely that the grammatical A argument in 82a is referential as
in ‘something hungry me’. In 82b, even though ‘the food grows us’ (mətmət ‘food’
as mass noun can be related to 3rd neuter person) seems to work semantically,
the sentence *mətmət ittu udu with mətmət as the NP argument is ungrammatical27 .
Thus the grammatical P arguments ngang ‘1SG’ and udu ‘1PL’ are the only referential
arguments, and thus the notional S arguments in these examples.
A transitive impersonal construction normally expresses experience, with the
experiencer as the object. On the other hand, the agent or causer is usually specified
by oblique structure (83).","[99, 100]"

regarding’ when used together with verbs such as mume, məngar or bokbok meaning
‘talk; say’ (390a), as well as nouns such as a-pir 52 ‘story’ (390b). In this sense, be is

Discourse deixis encodes reference to some portion of the text in which the utterance is located (Levinson, 1983:85). It means that discourse deixis can refer to
an earlier or forthcoming portion of the discourse relative to the speaker’s current
location in the discourse. Similar to the anaphoric use of the demonstratives, the
commonly used ones in Tulil are deictic and spatial terms: vi (upcoming text), bət
and bo (earlier text).

[AL-TC-049]Chapter 8Structure of the verb complex
In this chapter, I will discuss the structure of the verb complex. The verb complex
is the head of the verbal clause (cf. §3.2), as shown in Figure 8.1. A verb complex
comprises the head (§8.2), verbal adjuncts (§8.3), and flagging/serial verbs (§8.4).
Pre-VC elements that are commonly related to verbal operators are considered
to be clause-level constituents, rather than components of the VC, given the fact
that they behave similarly to both verbal and non-verbal predicates (cf. §3.1.4).
These constituents include irrealis ka/aka, iamitive bə and the negator kori/ko, and
are discussed in §4.11. bə and da are particles that can also precede phrase-level
constituents. Details of these elements can be found in word class chapter (§4).
O/SO arguments, oblique arguments and adjuncts occur as post-VC elements.

morphological structure of Tulil verbs will be discussed in §9.","[304, 305, 306, 307]"

mixture of both.
konəng can follow an element and modify it. It can have a scope over a single

(7) /i/ →(8) /u/ →
 [ɪ] / closed syllable
 [i] / elsewhere

 [ʊ] / closed syllable
 [u] / elsewhereSchwa is comparatively weak in Tulil. For instance, /ə/ between stops/fricatives
and liquid is often shortened or deleted in fast speech:
(9) ‘scratch’ /kəri/ > [kʰəri] ∼ [kʰə̌ri] ∼ [kʰri]
‘pierce’ /vəlok/ > [vəlok] ∼ [və̌lok] ∼ [vlok]24CHAPTER 2. PHONOLOGYAlso, /ə/ is often deleted when combining with another vowel during suffixation/encliticization (cf. §2.5.1). And there are certain cases where /ə/ can be
deleted or inserted between consonants (cf. §2.5.2).
These facts may suggest that schwa has limited distribution and may be epenthetic historically, however, its occurrence is not fully predictable synchronically
(cf. Blevins & Pawley, 2010; Evans & Miller, 2016). For instance, the ending schwa
cannot be predicted by word class or phonological contexts: e.g. near minimal pairs
məgunə v. ‘swallow’ and gun v. ‘count’; vətə v. ‘fish in creek’ n. ‘protein’, pət v.
‘break’ and vət class marking meaning ‘one segment of’.
Vowels seldom occur word-initially: 1) initial high vowels /i/ and /u/ are analyzed as approximants /j/ and /w/; 2) /a/ mostly occurs as initials when it is the
affixal article (cf. §4.2), or person prefix; or initial of particles such as ar ‘still’; 3)
/ə/ never occurs word-initially; 4) /o/ occurs once as initial oraorong ‘big noise’,
and on its own as the topic marker o; 5) /e/ occurs as person prefix.
(Near-)Minimal pairs of vowels occurring in interconsonantal and final positions
are shown in Table 2.6.
Table 2.6: Vowel (near-)minimal pairs

Tulil avoids identical vowel sequences on the surface, and two vowels of the same
quality usually merge into one in surface realization, given that there is no observable length difference between a single and a double vowel. This phonological rule
does not only apply word internally (affixation), but also between words inside a
phrase (cliticization), and in fast speech across word boundaries.
This process is commonly observed in 1) patientive marking =a PAT and borrowing article a- ART of the following noun; 2) noun class marking =a SG.CLF:MASC

There is another type of ditransitive construction, shown in 90b and 90c. In
this type of construction, the recipient of ‘give’ can occur after the theme (90b), or
after an adjunct (90c) and marked by the prepositional use of tuk ‘RECIP’.
3.2.2.4 Locative clausesIn a locative clause, demonstratives, prepositions and some locational adverbs
function as the predicate and can take a person index, and express locational,
possessive and existential meaning. The person indexes used with demonstratives/prepositions are ‘defective paradigms’ with no tense distinction28 (paradigms
can be found in §4.7.6 and §4.7.7). Clauses with some particles (such as quotative
e, directionals mən ‘from’ and tə(kə) ‘to’) preceded by special non-tensed person
indexes are also classified into this type.
28. Baining language may have a similar strategy: in the description of Mali-Baining, Stebbins differentiates
between ‘active’ verbless clause and ‘stative’ verbless clause, where demonstratives are considered to be ‘active’
because it requires indexing pattern similar to active intransitive verbal clause, with a different paradigm,
expressing existence, possession and location (Stebbins, 2011:48-49).",[105]

ti ‘LEST’Many subordinating morphemes in Tulil are polyfunctional, serving another
function such as prepositions. They can also introduce more than one type of
subordinate clause, as well as leading a main clause by themselves:

In this section I will discuss the subordinating morpheme to as a general subordinator, given that it can be used for more than one type of subordination, to
give an idea of the flexibility in interpreting the clause/constituent relations in Tulil. The use of the purposive particle da and LEST ti will also be discussed: even
though they are only used as subordinators in adverbial clauses, they can occur in
all types of subordinate clauses as modality particles, expressing desiderative and
apprehensional-epistemic meanings. This will also be clarified in §12.1.2.1. Other
subordinating morphemes will be discussed locally concerning different types of
subordinate clauses.
12.1.2.1Purposive da and LEST tiPurposive da and LEST ti have similar behaviors and distributions: both of them can
introduce independent clauses, subordinate clauses and can be used as prepositions
‘for’ and ‘afraid of’, taking NP complements79 (detailed discussion and examples can
be found in §4.11.3). When forming independent clauses, da expresses desiderative
and ti apprehensional-epistemics.
When used as subordinators, da and ti can introduce adverbial clauses (751).
In this case, they express purposive ‘in order to’ (751a) and precaution ‘avertive’
79. Uses of the two morphemes as leading NP elements will be glossed as ‘for’ and ‘afraid of’, and all other
uses with be glossed as PURP and LEST respectively in the examples.","[405, 406]"

Non-verbal clauses can encode other functions such as existential and identificational. Most of these functions are expressed by various types of nominal clauses.
3.4.5.1 ExistentialType I nominal clause consisting of a bare NP is usually existential, stating existence
of something. The predicate can be a core NP, or pronominal, such as a pronominal
demonstrative:98CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE(147)ar bəvon kup

3SG.F.POSS.AL name=SG.CLF:FEM ART.F-PN‘Long time ago there was a Baining woman whose name is Namugi. ’
[LG-VI-003]
Another way of expressing existential meaning is through locative clauses (verbal),
when the subject NP is interpreted as indefinite. The clauses shown have alternative readings as locational, when the subjects NP have definite interpretation (e.g.
‘That man is around here’ in 148b). This type of existential expression differs from
the nominal type in that it usually encode locational information.

[JK-P1-008]3.4.5.2IdentificationalIdentificational meaning differ from predicational meaning in that the former intends to provide exhaustive and holistic information about the subject, while the
latter modifies the content an already existing mental file (Stassen, 1997:103-104).

The term ‘adjunct’ is used here to cover modifiers in clause structure that are
loosely attached to the clause, in contrast with ‘complement’, which is considered
to be obligatory in a clause structure. Adjuncts are distinguished mainly on a
semantic basis. They include semantic categories as spatial-temporal, manner purpose, reason, condition.
The common structures used as adjuncts are PPs, adverbials including adverbs,
adverbial demonstratives, and adverbial clauses. Adjuncts tend to occur towards
the end of the clause, or in the topic position, and it is possible to stack multiple
adjuncts. Manner adverbs differ from other adjuncts in that they directly follows
the verb inside a verb complex.
3.5.1 Adverbs
When adverbs are used as adjuncts, they usually express temporal, spatial and
manner informations.

[AL-DI-001]100CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTUREIn the above example, do ‘here’ can express either spatial meaning ‘here’, or temporal meaning ‘now’33 . Depends on the context, the distinction can be either clear
or ambiguous. Similar words also exist in other categories, such as demonstratives
nəbət ‘there, that time’.
Manner adverbs modify verbs and directly follow a verb inside a verb complex,
before the post-verbal arguments. Also, the valency of the verb complex is decreased when a manner adverb is present, and an applicative particle n(ə) needs
to precede the argument.

like.this‘He threw her (torch) into the pit like this.’[AL-TC-034]3.5.4 Complex forms of adjuncts: directional clitics
Two directional clitics can procliticized to most of the adjunct constituents and
form complex forms, indicating the source (mən ‘from’) and goal (tə/təkə ‘to’) of
a change of location/situation. The form təkə is used with deictic words such as
do ‘here, now’ and demonstratives (162 shows possible combinations and forms).
Adverbs can be classified into demonstrative-like adverbs and PP-like adverbs: the
former takes the allomorph təkə= of the directional clitic ‘to’, and the latter takes
tə= as PPs (certain words such as təkerə ‘beside’ and təbərtəm ‘afternoon’ do not102CHAPTER 3. BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTUREtake directional clitics). The following example shows the simple preposition be
‘at’ combining with both of the directional clitics:

4.7.7 Prepositional indexes
There are two different sets of prepositional indexes: one is used for the preposition
to ‘of’, and one for the other prepositions (including the comitative n) (forms of both
can be found in §10.1.2.3). The person indexes of to ‘of’ index the possessee NP
before to, and the posseesee NP is optional if it can be retrieved from the context.
The person index is compulsory when to is used as the predicate of locative clauses146CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSES(3.2.2.4). When used as complement of NPs, person indexes are compulsory except
when the possessee is 3rd person neuter (unspecified).

Positional adverbs nogət ‘ahead, in front of’ and pədəm ‘after, behind’ use the
same set of person indexes as general prepositions in locative clauses:4.7. PRONOMINALS(251)147doto da

she said, ’they went first this way’, then I said, ’they are not here’,
and when they left you, you say, ’they are already gone today’, like
this.’
[JN-BL-011]
The examples show that in the current use of the language, when some young
people want to say ‘you two go first’, they use it-nogət with the person index it
rather than iu-nogət with the person index iu. The reason is that the person indexes
for nogət is not tensed and iu for either past or non-past event, and it has a tendency
to be used as real verb, where the 2nd person plural prefix for future tense is it.
But even in the ‘correct’ usage, it-nogət still makes sense because the same form it
is used as the 3rd person dual index.
4.7.8 Quotative indexes
Person indexes on quotative e use the gender(2) (cf. 10.1.2) system in 3rd person.
In both cases, -e has a defective inflectional pattern that resembles an m-initial
verb (cf. §9) in NPST tense, but does not have a corresponding PST tense inflection.
Thus, when -e is used as the predicate, it does distinguish between past and nonpast. More discussion can be found in §10.1.2.4.

In Tulil, demonstratives function as predicates, NP heads or appositional pronominals in the NP, and adjuncts of the verb complex. I will call them identificational
demonstrative, nominal demonstrative and local adverbial demonstrative respectively, following Diessel (1999). Example (254) gives examples of demonstratives
taking up different syntactic functions. Details of the formal and functional properties of demonstratives can be found in §7).

A preposition is the head of a prepositional phrase (PP), taking one complement
(usually an NP). PPs commonly combine with demonstratives to specify spatial
relations. PPs can also occur by themselves as adjuncts within NP or verbal predicates, as well as complements of verbless clauses. Discussion of prepositions can be
found in §6.
PPs usually take the following form:150CHAPTER 4. WORD CLASSESPP → [PREP =PAT + (NP)]
A preposition takes an NP as complement, with a patientive marker in between
(except mənu ‘back.of’). Examples of a PP can be seen in the following example:

speech are heterogeneous, and always taken as a miscellaneous or residual category (Pittner et al., 2015). A commonly consulted definition is from Huddleston
& Pullum (2002:563): “Adverbs characteristically modify verbs and other categories except nouns, especially adjectives and adverbs.”
Five broad subclasses of adverbs are often distinguished, categorized according
to semantics (Haspelmath, 2001): setting adverbs (locative and temporal), manner
adverbs, degree adverbs, linking adverbs, and sentence adverbs. Tulil has the first
four types.
4.10.1Locative and temporal adverbsBoth locative and temporal adverbs can be used as event adjuncts following the
verb complex, event predicates in non-verbal clause, or as frame-setting topics, in
the sense that they specify ‘a domain of (possible) reality to which the proposition
expressed is restricted.’ (Jacobs, 2006:656).

[JK-CB-002]
Morphologically, locative/temporal adverbs can be roughly classified into two
categories: demonstrative-like adverbs and PP-like adverbs. A general criterion is
that the former takes the allomorph təkə= of the directional clitic ‘to’, and the latter
takes tə= as PPs (certain words such as təkerə ‘beside’ and təbərtəm ‘afternoon’ do
not take directional clitics).
Demonstrative-like locative adverbs consist of 1) a large group of demonstrative
adverbs formed by attaching the locative morpheme nə to the demonstrative roots
(for instance, nə-bo ‘up there’, nə-mu ‘in there’, cf.§7.1); 2) do ‘here’ which behaves
like the demonstrative adverbs.

[WM-JJ-014]
PP-like locative adverbs include locative expressions such as davə ‘above’, bəro
‘at the creek’, dəratəm ‘outside’. It is possible that these three words are derived
from prepositions, see analysis and examples in §6.7).
Another type of PP-like locative adverbs can combine with applicative n,
applicative-like morpheme m, or zero-derivation to form prepositional phrases or
prepositions. mədərəp ‘in the middle’, nogət ‘ahead, in front’, and pədəm ‘behind,
at the back’ can combine with applicative n to form a preposition-like expression (260b, composite prepositional expressions, see §6.2); təkerə ‘at the side’ and
gəvənəm ‘under’ can derive into prepositions təkermə and gəvənmə by attaching an
applicative-like morpheme m (261, see analysis in §6.2); and bərodəm ‘inside’ derives to preposition without overt morphological change40 , as in 262.

with unspecified complements. And for other words, there is also a tendency for 3rd neuter complement to
not be present in the text and use the adverb form. Further investigation of the text is needed for confirming
this hypothesis. More examples can be found in preposition chapter.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"
"14CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONChapter 2Phonology
Similar to what is observed for most Papuan languages (Foley, 1986:48-64), the
phonological system in Tulil is relatively straightforward and simple. This chapter
begins with a description of the phoneme system and phonetic realization of segments (consonants §2.1, vowels §2.2) and phonotactics (§2.3). The following section on suprasegmental features (§2.4) briefly describes stress assignment, with
instrumental analyses of sentential intonation. Other morphophonological processes (such as affix interactions and morphophonemic alternations) are described
in Section §2.5. In §2.6 a brief description of loanword adaptation is given.
Some acoustic analyses are given throughout the chapter: the analyses of individual phonemes are mostly based on a Swadesh list collected from two speakers:
LG (Luisa Gulua, female) and DP (Donald Puongo, male), and the sentence examples are extracted from the texts.","[45, 46, 47]"
"1.5. TYPOLOGICAL PROFILE9A limited set of data of the Butam language is also published by Laufer as a
summary of Futscher’s work (Laufer, 1959a), comprising around 200 words and a
brief grammar sketch. Butam is no longer spoken and the last speaker died in 1938.
According to Laufer, this speaker’s language ability is in doubt, and the accuracy
of the information provided can not be guaranteed.","[40, 41]"
"1.5 Typological profile
As mentioned earlier, Tulil (Butam), along with the Baining languages, is usually
grouped into the East Papuan languages, which are thought to be the descendants
of the languages spoken by the original inhabitants of Island Melanesia, before
the more recent settlement of the Austronesian people. East Papuan languages are
usually reported to show more influence from Austronesian languages than other
Papuan languages, due to their geographical vicinity. Dunn et al. (2002) examine
the structural features of the East Papuan languages from a typological point of
view. Among the similarities proposed for these languages, the pronominal system
is often highlighted for grouping purposes. Ross (2001, 2005) provides evidence to
suggest a East Papuan group based on comparison of the pronoun paradigms. Also,
descriptive data suggests that almost all of the East Papuan languages have some
sort of nominal classification system (cf. Terrill, 2002). Though it is pointed out
that gender system are not impossible to be borrowed (Dunn et al., 2002:29), both
the Tulil and the Butam language show nominal classification systems similar to
the Baining languages (nominal classification system of Tulil is elaborated in this
study, cf. chapter 10) and complex to an extent that it does not seem to be easily
borrowed.
A list of relevant typological features of Tulil is provided in Table 1.2, with
reference to features of both the western Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family
and the Trans New Guinean type Papuan languages (features of the two groups
adapted from Ross, 1996:186). Table 1.3 compares the features of Tulil to both
Tolai (Mosel, 1984) and Mali Baining (Stebbins, 2011). The bolded features in
both Tables show the features that other groups have that are similar to the Tulil
language.
Tulil has a fairly simple phonological system, similar to what is observed for
most Papuan languages (Foley, 1986:48-64). It has a phoneme inventory of medium size, with 15 consonants and 6 vowels (cf. §2). Four places (bilabial, alveolar,
palatal and velar) and six manners (stop, nasal, fricative, trill, lateral and approximant) of articulation are distinguished. The stop series include voiceless (p, t, k)
and voiced stops (b, d, g). The voiced stops are always prenasalized.
The basic order of clausal constituents is SVO, with split-intransitivity alignment10CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONTable 1.2: Typological features of Tulil

(A/SA arguments expressed by NP constitute approximately 12% among all cases)9 .
Unlike in Tolai and Baining languages, where preposed articles are utilized for
marking definiteness in common nouns, Tulil only has a prefixal article a- which
marks borrowed words (cf. §4.2). Proper names also take articles in Tulil: the
articles are to for men and e for women. This is similar to the Tolai language
where names of men are marked by to and women by la (Mosel, 1984:17-19).
Tulil makes a distinction between alienable and inalienable possession (cf.§4.2.4,
§5.8), marked by different possessor indexes attaching to a possessed noun. Inalienable possessive indexes differ from alienable possessive indexes in 1SG and 3SG,
and these inalienable possessive indexes tend to cliticized to the possessum. The

"4.2. NOUNS115On root level, one productive derivational process can be identified, which is
nominalization, by means of reduplication. The reduplicative form used in nominalization is the same form as non-finite verb forms such as infinitives, gerunds and
coverbs (cf.§9.2).

across word classes. For instance, prototypical nouns referring to people or entities are never found to be used as head of a verb complex and processes involving
nouns such as ‘become a man’ are expressed by non-verbal clauses §3.3.
Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to identify the features that are associated with various classes of words, rather than drawing categorial distinctions
between classes. However, I will make some arbitrary choices on top of the criteria
provided, but at the same time bear in mind the possibility of finding more items
flexibly used in different functions, if provided with more data.

nucleus in “verb phrase” in the descriptions of some Oceanic languages (eg. Hyslop
2001)64 The structure of the verb complex in Tulil is represented in Figure 8.2 and
with further details in Figure 8.3.
The verb complex in Tulil is a surface constituent in descriptive terms, rather
than a completely coherent unit in its deep structure (Pawley, 2003:151). The
elements inside a VC occur in a fixed order. However, the right end of the VC is
loosely bound - the further the elements are from the nucleus (verb stem), the more
likely they 1) are intervened by other elements, such as adverbial demonstratives;
2) form a new intonation unit. The lexicalized status of the elements that occur in
slot 3 (Figure 8.3) as the right boundary of the VC are not quite clear-cut. This will
be discussed in details in §8.4.1.

"Verb morphology in Tulil is fairly complex. Multiple stems are involved in the forma-tion of verbs related to different grammatical categories. Verb morphology involves mainlyprefixing, including person/number/gender/tense portmanteau prefixes marking A/SA ar-guments, and reduplication (marking imperfective aspect). Multiple stems are involvedderivational processes include the applicative suffix and incorporation. The morphophon-ological pattern of verb inflection in Tulil is not immediately transparent, and involves an
interaction between initial consonant mutation and reduplication of the stems.xixxxStatement of authorship

[SV-ES-011]7.2.2 Demonstratives as indentifier/locational
Predicative demonstratives are those that occur in verbal clauses (locative clause,
§3.2.2.4). There are three types of meanings related to a predicative demonstrative:
1) identify the referent, as in English ‘This is...’ (498); 2) indicate a location, which
can fill out different roles in different event types, such as is location (where a
referent is found, 499), goal (500), path (501). The determination of the specific
interpretation is context-based.

[JK-GT-023]
For instance, in example 499, the clause with a demonstrative predicate can
mean either ‘The food is just here.’ or ‘This is just food.’ if occurring in isolation,7.2. SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS OF DEMONSTRATIVES251but the story shows that the addressee of this sentence is hungry and looking for
food.
In the use of the predicative demonstrative as describing a motion, the stem is
sometimes the reduplicated form (501, see §7.1.1.2 for details). Though indicating
a type of event in this case, no formal distinction can be identified between the
dynamic use and the static use (the same person index is used for both non-past
and past event, compare 500 and 502), thus it is taken as a type of dynamic reading
expressed by a verbless construction (cf. Västi & Kittilä 2016).

Like other adverbs, adverbial demonstratives can occur in various positions in a
sentence: 1) at the beginning of the clause as topic / frame-setting elements (503a);
2) modifying the verb complex (503b)(for structure of verb complex, see §8); 3) as
topic (504a) or complement (504b) of the non-verbal clause.

The phoneme /p/ is somehow special in the following senses: 1) it never occurs
word-finally (word-final [p] is in fact an allophone of /β/ rather than /p/, as will
be explained below in §2.1.2); 2) the words where /p/ occurs word-initially are
mostly borrowed words, ideophones, or possibly onomatopoeia originated words
such as names of drums, etc. see Table 2.3. This may suggest that initial /p/ was
not native to the Tulil language. One interesting observation is that the word pir
in Kuanua, while having two meanings ‘(tell) a story’ and ‘weave’, adapted into
Tulil to pir and vir respectively. It may suggest that the latter is borrowed into the
language earlier.
2.1.2 Fricatives
There are two fricative phonemes in Tulil: bilabial fricative /β/ and alveolar fricative /s/.
The alveolar fricative /s/ only occurs in loanwords, such as a-sipet ‘shovel’ and
a-sol ‘salt’ (borrowings of Tok Pisin). This suggests /s/ as a loan phoneme (§2.6.1).
In many cases, the /s/ in the source language can also be adapted to /t/ when
entering Tulil, and the use of both /t/ and /s/ can be observed (e.g. a-tol ‘salt’ is
also found in the corpus; a-sto and a-tito ‘store’). The occurrence of this phoneme
may be relatively recent, given that words borrowed earlier seem to only use /t/
(e.g. a-tade [atan de] n. ‘Sunday; church’ tade v. ‘worship’; but never *sade).
13. This voicing rule exists in Mali Baining (Stebbins, 2011:19-20).","[50, 51]"
"1.6 The data
The corpus which forms the basis of this description of Tulil was mostly collected by
myself during nine months of field work in Papua New Guinea from November to
December, 2012 and from January to September 2014. Out of these nine months I
spent the whole time in Tulil village 1/2, and a couple of days in Kadaulung village
with the Butam descendents. The language description presented in this thesis is
based on the dialect spoken in Tulil village 1/2. Up to this stage, few dialectal
variations have been noticed of the Tulil language as a whole. In addition to that,
recordings collected by Schneider (transcribed by me and informants) were also
incorporated into the corpus and used as material for the analysis of this grammar.
I recorded about 21.5 hours of texts (both audio and video) in total, from 40
different speakers (25 male, 15 female), ranging in age from 14 to about 82. The
description presented in this grammar is based on about 13.5 hours of these recordings which are transcribed and translated in Elan10 . They comprise mostly
narratives and procedural texts. There are also some conversations, songs and
stimulus-based elicitation. Other types of recorded material such as community
meetings and classroom interactions are not yet transcribed and thus were not included.
The recorded material is supplemented by field notes of elicitation sessions and
participant observation. In addition to that, I used the following wordlist, questionnaires and stimuli: Swadesh list (207 items), Dahl’s questionnaire on tense and
aspect categories (Dahl 1985), BowPed topological stimulus (Bowerman & Pederson, 1992), each with one male and one female speakers.
A lexical database in Toolbox format based on this corpus consists of about 1286
entries at present.
I worked with 6 informants on transcribing and elicitation (each worked for different period/length of times): Donald Puongo, Elsie Evan, Kalistus Luaina, Louis
Gulua, Maria Rikie, Wenzel Mogor (in alphabetic order).
The writing of this grammar is mainly based on the basic descriptive framework,
and does not explicitly commit to on any specific theoretical frameworks.

1.1 Overview of the Tulil speakers and the language
The Tulil language is spoken on the island of New Britain of Papua New Guinea. It
is spoken by approximately 2000 people as of year 2000 according to Ethnologue
(Simons & Fennig, 2017), spreading over four villages (Tulil 1, Tulil 2, Kadaulung
and Toma). The Tulil people are referred to by their neighbours as ‘Taulil’, and
‘Tulil’ is the name they call themselves. The Butam people also live among the
Tulil people, and none of them is known to possess knowledge of the Butam language that has to be considered extinct, after the last speaker died in 1938 (Laufer,
1959a).
According to the oral history being passed on among the Tulil people1 , Tulils,
as well as Butams, both migrated from New Ireland Island long time ago, before
the Tolais’ arrival. According to this oral history, Tulils departed from Namatanai,
and landed in New Britain from Ataliklikun Bay in Epelik (named after a lady who
died during the process of migration), in between the Keravat river and Tivanakot
river, and gradually moved inland. Butams, on the other hand, departed from Siar
and landed from the east where the Varangoi river meets the sea. The two groups
later became one during an era of constant tribal fights with Tolais and Bainings,
and since then live in the ‘buffer area’ between these two big ethnic groups. It is
reported that the Butam group was wiped out after constant raids from the nearby
tribes in 1880s, and a few survivors sought protection from the Tulil and since then
living among them (Parkinson, 2010:75).
The majority of the Tulil ethnic group is residing in Tulil 1 and Tulil 2, in a
narrow area between the Tolais in Rapitok, and the Bainings in Gaulim. There is
no clear geographic boundary between the two villages, and the division may only
be an administrative one: Tulil 1 is based on Protestant institution and Tulil 2 on
Catholic one. Except for these two villages, a few families live in Toma with the
1. Collected from Ludwick Rickie (LR_TH).","[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
