"PT'Just look how well she is working.' (K84,4:ll)
(German: 'Schau mal, wie gut sie arbeitet.')
In contrast to the other particles of this section, sadra normally occurs sentence-internally, reflecting its origin as an adverb (see also examples (630),
(1197), (1198c)).
13.3.9. The particle Sa
This sentence-initial particle is used in Imperative and Hortative sentences.
It is of course originally the same word as the Imperative of atun 'come', Sa
(9.3.1.3.).

As has been noted in 9.3.5., verbs are negated by the negative suffix -6 or by
the negative prefix tA-. Such verbal negation is the normal sentence negation in Lezgian, e.g.
(638) a. Xürünwi-jr.iada-wajmeslät-arqaöu-zwa.villager-PL(ERG) he-ADELadvice-PLtake-IMPF(HQ89:14)The villagers take advice from him.'
b. Xürünwi-jr.iada-wajvillager-PL(ERG) he-ADELmeslät-ar
advice-PLqaöu-zwa-δ.take-IMPF-NEGThe villagers do not take advice from him.'
But when a constituent that is in contrastive focus is negated, the negative particle wa? is postposed after the constituent. (This particle also serves
as a negative pro-sentence in answers to polar questions, cf. 23.1.5.) The contrasting constituent is usually also present in the sentence.
(639) a. Amwa-laj-nithat:ABS you-SREL-andZerli.di-laj

not present, verbal negation is used. In (640), the context makes it clear that
the addressees were indeed invited, but also for some other reason.
(640) Cnawe:ERGkwe-ziniz aniaxyou.all-DAT hereöajonlyqhwa-z[teateklif-nawa-L·drink-INF] invite-PRF-NEG(L86,3:23)'We have not invited you-all here only to drink tea.'
The following examples are similar in that the verbal negation affects not
the verb but another constituent.
(641) a. Kazbegov.a-zTezetdin.a-nKazbegov-DATbarakTezetdin-GENhutsadlahanazaga-na-6-ir.immediatelyfind-AOR -NEG-PST'Kazbegov did not find Tezetdin's hut immediately. [But he found

The substantivized participle construction, which sometimes marks focus
(cf. 19.3.2.), may be used for negating focused constituents, as in (642).
However, as examples like (640)-(641) show, this is not obligatory.
(642) Adaixtilathawajahe(ERG) conversation in.vainkud-nawa-j-dituk (L86,3:17)start-PRF-PTP-SBST COP:NEG'He started the conversation not without reason.'","[264, 265, 266]"

Positive answers to polar questions are expressed by the particle eöt 'yes' or its
more colloquial synonym un. Negative answers are expressed by wa? 'no'
(also 'nof, cf. 13.4.).
(1177) A Bade,wa-zmax-aröi-da-ni?bade.di-zgzafmax-aröi-da,grandmother you-DAT tale-PLgrandmother-DATmanyknow-FUT-Qtale-PLΒ: E5t,

Answers to negative questions are treated as in English, i.e. wa? 'no' confirms the negation of the questioned sentence (cf. 1179), and e£ 'yes' contradicts the negative assumption of the question (cf. 1180).

"9.3. Verbal inflectional categories 133
9.3.5. Prefixal negation and the Periphrasis forms
Finite indicative verb forms are negated by means of the suffix -δ (e.g.
guzwa 'gives', guzwa-c 'does not give'). Non-finite and non-indicative verb
forms are negated by prefixal negation. In most verbs this means periphrastic negation involving the negative auxiliary t-awun 'not do', but a
closed set of verbs take the negative prefix t(A)- (a high vowel occurs only in
tü-t'ü-n 'not to eatO themselves, i.e. they have inflectional, not periphrastic,
prefixal negation. According to Moor (1985), this closed class consists of the
following members:

'bring'
'throw'
'keep, guard'
'fall (precipitation)'
'eaf
'kill'
'hold'
'leave, admit, cause'Note that all of these verbs are strong, and most of them are monosyllabic. Even the disyllabic verbs in this class have disyllabic negated forms
(the root vowel is deleted in taxwun, talhun, tewhin).
This class is becoming smaller and smaller. Already now, Moor notes,
most of the above verbs can alternatively be negated periphrastically, except
for awun and xun. And in Uslar (1896:§258, §274), the class is much larger.
Uslar lists about sixty verbs with inflectional prefixal negation, including
weak and polysyllabic verbs, e.g.:
aqwazun
eqiigun
rasunt-aqwazun
t-eqiigun
ta-rasun'stop'
'scold'
'repair'Periphrastic prefixal negative forms are formed with the auxiliary tawun 'not do' and the Periphrasis form. The Periphrasis form is always
identical to the base in weak verbs, and in strong verbs it is most commonly
identical to the Masdar, e.g.:1349. Verbal inflectionqaöun tawun

give-FUT-PST'He answered the clients' questions lazily, without raising his head.'
However, the Periphrasis form of strong verbs that is combined with an
Imperfective-stem verb form of the auxiliary is optionally based on the
Imperfective stem itself. Since the Imperfective Periphrasis form also takes
the suffix -n, it is formally identical to the affirmative Hortative. Thus we
have, e.g.
raxun tawun 'not talking'
raxan tijiz
'not to talk'
raxun tawuna 'not having talked't'iin tawun
'not eating'
nen tijiz
'not to eaf
t'iin tawuna 'not having eaten'This Periphrasis form with the same distribution (i.e., weak verbs: = base;
strong verbs: = Masdar, optionally = Hortative for Imperfective-stem forms)
is also used in the following two cases:
(A) In periphrastic Repetitives (cf. 10.4.):
ksun qhuwun
ksan qHjida
ksun qhuwuna'sleeping again'
'will sleep again'
'fell asleep again'kilig qhuwuraj
kilig qHjizwa
kilig qhuwuna'let...look again'
'is looking again'
'looked again'(B) When the verb base is focused and marked by the focus marker -ni
'also' (cf. 18.1.2.).","[152, 153, 154]"
"23.5. Question particles
Several discourse particles are often used in questions (for other discourse
particles, see 13.3.). They express various nuances of the tone of the question
and are hard to translate into English. Like other discourse particles, they are
either sentence-initial or follow the verb directly.23.5.1. bes
This sentence-initial particle is perhaps the most common question particle.
This particle often conveys the speaker's expectation of a negative answer.(1207) a. Bes xalq'.di-n nexir ni

These are based not on interrogative pronouns, but on the stem sa- 'one'.
Most of these forms are listed in Table 5 above (11.3.). In addition, the following forms exist:
(462) a. sa kas
b. sa zat'
c. sadra'someone, a certain person'
'something, a certain thing'
'once'These indefinites are used when the identity of the referent is known to
the speaker but if the speaker chooses not to tell the hearer. Thus, (463a) is
preferred to (463b) if the speaker knows the person she met.

11.6.4. Negative indefinite pronouns
These are derived from the specific indefinite pronouns by means of a
phrase-final suffix -ni ('also, even'):
(464) a. sa ...-ni
'no' (e.g. sa gaf-ni 'no word')
b. sa kas-ni
'nobody7
c. sa zat'-ni
'nothing'
d. sadra-ni
'never'
e. sak'-ni
'noway'
f. sana-ni
'nowhere'
etc. (cf. Table 5 in 11.3.)
The two pronouns sa kas-ni 'nobody' and sa zat'-ni 'nothing' have a
suppletive oblique stem: The oblique cases of sa kasni are based on sa-d-a'one (substantivized)', and the oblique cases of sa zat'ni are based on the
stem kün-i-:

"1.3. A user's guide to this grammar
This book is intended as a reference grammar of Lezgian for linguists who
wish to learn more about Lezgian grammar as a whole or about particular
aspects of it.
Since it was written for linguists, the grammar presupposes familiarity
with a large number of fundamental grammatical notions which greatly facilitate the concise formulation of grammatical regularities. However, it
contains no framework-specific jargon, idiosyncratic formalisms, or other
unnecessary obstacles.
1.3.1. User-friendly features
An attempt has been made to make this grammar maximally user-friendly
even for readers who need a particular piece of information (e.g. for a crosslinguistic investigation) and have no time to wade through the whole
grammar. This grammar has the following features that make it easy to use
as a reference work:
(A) Morpheme-by-morpheme glosses with brackets marking subordinate
clauses for better readability (cf. 1.3.5.).
(B) A detailed subject index which, in addition to normal entries referring
to places in the book, contains entries that do not occur elsewhere in the
book. Such entries are names of grammatical phenomena that do not occur
in the language. Thus, looking up the subject index suffices to find out that
Lezgian has no passive, no dual, no tones. There are of course no negative
statements about these categories in the grammar, and since the mere absence of a category in the index proves nothing, the negative information in
the index might be useful.
(C) An index to the example sentences. Since the examples (most of
which were taken from original Lezgian texts) usually show other interesting phenomena in addition to the point which they illustrate in the particular place in the text, such an index makes a lot of additional information
available. By looking up the number of an example in the index, the reader1.3. A user's guide to this grammar9can find up to twenty more examples elsewhere in the grammar that illustrate the same point.
(D) A more or less complete bibliography of scholarly works on Lezgian.
Most of these are not mentioned in the text, but a reader who is interested
in further information or different points of view is given the chance to
look them up. The subject index simultaneously serves as an index to the
bibliography. This step was taken so as not to clutter the text with references
that few readers will find useful because most of the publications are difficult to get outside of Daghestan.
(E) An index to the grammatical morphemes of Lezgian.
1.3.2. Structure of the grammar
The structure of this grammar follows the well-established traditional order:
phonology — morphology — syntax — texts. This ensures that the amount
of information that is presupposed in a given section but comes later in the
book is minimized.
The morphological chapters deal with the form and the meaning of the
grammatical items of the language. For inflectional categories, the inflection
as a whole is first described, followed by a description of the meanings of the
individual inflectional categories. For derivational categories, form and
meaning are treated together.
While the morphology takes the analytical perspective (from form to
function), the syntax takes the synthetic perspective (from function to form),
with chapter topics such as coordination, relative clauses, complement
clauses, adverbial clauses, coreference, questions, and comparison. All these
are taken as functional notions. For example, participial relative clauses and
correlative relative clauses show no formal similarities, but they are treated
together in Ch. 19 because of their similar function.
Thus, this grammar to some extent fulfills the theoretical requirement to
present the grammatical information both from an analytical and from a
synthetic perspective (von der Gabelentz 1901, Lehmann 1980). For example,
the functions of the Dative case are described twice: First from an analytical
perspective in the chapter on nominal inflection (7.2.2.4.); and then from a
synthetic perspective in the sections on verbal valence (15.3.2., 15.4.1.), on
adjectival valence (14.5.1.1.), and on spatial and temporal adverbials
(16.3.1.1., 16.3.2.1.). Similarly, the functions of the Aorist converb are described twice: First in the chapter on verbal inflection (9.9.4.), and then in
the sections on adverbial clauses (21.1.) and on complement clauses (20.6.1.2.). Sometimes only cross-references are made to avoid unnecessary repetitions.
However, this grammar, too, has an analytical bias. Not everything is described from a synthetic point of view. For example, there is no function-toform treatment of tense meanings, or of number meanings. For such phenomena, the form-to-function description must suffice.","[28, 29]"
"Chapter 17
Copular clausesWhen the predicative phrase in a copular clause is a noun phrase or an adjective phrase, the standard copula ja (Past tir, negative tu$, Past negative
tuS-ir, cf. 9.5.1.) is used. When the predicative phrase is an adverbial expression, one of the local copulas is used (awa 'be in', kwa 'be under', etc.). The
verb £un 'become, be' may also be used in either function.","[330, 331]"
"19411. Pronouns11.6. Indefinite pronouns
There are four main types (or series) of indefinite pronouns: ordinary, freechoice, specific, and negative indefinites. Some of the indefinite pro-forms
from this series are illustrated in (453).
(453) ordinary
sa wui jat'anifree-choice
wui &ajit'anispecific
kasnegative
sa kas-nisa wuö jat'aniwuöStajit'anisa zat'sa zat'nisa musjat'animusitajit'anisadrasadranisa hinajat'anihinaAajit'anisanasananietc.etc.sa'a person''anyone''someone''something'
'sometime''somewhere''anything'
'anytime''anywhere'etc.'a thing''nothing'
'never''once'
'at a place'etc.'nobod/'nowhere'The formation of ordinary and free-choice indefinites is quite straightforward: The indefiniteness-marking particle jat'ani /Aajit'ani follows the
corresponding interrogative pro-form, and in the case of the ordinary indefinite, the numeral sa 'one' in addition precedes the interrogative. The formation of specific and negative indefinites is somewhat more complicated,
cf. 11.6.3.-4.
When indefinites function as nominal modifiers, the particle iajit'ani
follows the whole noun phrase, while the particle jat'ani tends to follow
the interrogative immediately:
(454) a. hiwhichwaxt.und-a
time-lNESSAajit'aniINDEF'at any time'
b. sahi&tin jat'anione whichINDEFqalabuluxconfusion'some sort of confusion'
The formal makeup of the two indefiniteness-markers jat'ani
and
itajit'ani is quite transparent: They are concessive conditional verb forms of
the standard copula ja and the verb £un 'be', respectively. Thus, the meaning of wui itajit'ani is literally 'whoever it may be' (cf. 21.8.4., and the quite
analogous French form qui que ce soit).

and Maxaikala who spent many hours with me, patiently answering questions whose points were mostly obscure to them: Muminat M. Gusejnova,
Maisa Xalimbekova, Muradxan Axmedov, Fizuli and Salbuzdag Kurbanov,
Nizam Zagirov, Etibar Bagirov, Farid I. Gusejnov.
I am very grateful to Professor Axmedula G. Gjul'magomedov for his
hospitality in Maxaikala, to Muminat and Ibrahim Gusejnov for making
me feel at home in their house, and to Farid Gusejnov for his friendship.
I also profited from discussions with Bukar B. Talibov, Enver M. Sejxov
and RadZidin I. Gajdarov in Maxaikala, and with Sandro V. Kodzasov,
Mixail E. Alekseev, Vjaieslav A. Cirikba, and Aleksandr E. Kibrik in
Moscow.
Georg Bossong read the whole manuscript and suggested various improvements. Sandro Kodzasov, Matthias Butt, and Michael Job read earlier
versions of the phonological chapters and provided numerous valuable
suggestions. And special thanks are due to Matthias Butt for solving all my
computational problems.
This work would not have been possible without the generous financial
and organizational support of the German Academic Exchange Service
(DAAD). I thank Moscow State University and especially the Linguistics
Department for their hospitality (Irina Μ. Kobozeva, Aleksandr E. Kibrik).
And I would also like to mention some of my Moscow friends and colleagues who made my stay there such a unique experience: Sergej A.
Krylov, Mira Β. Bergel'son, Andrej A. Kibrik, Vladimir A. Plungian, Ol'ga
Ju. Boguslavskaja, Igor' M. Boguslavskij, Yakov G. Testelec, Leonid I.
Kulikov, Vera I. Podlesskaya and (from Leningrad/St.Petersburg) Vladimir
P. Nedjalkov.
Most of the actual writing of this grammar was done while I had the privilege to work in the ideal environment of the European Science Foundation
Programme in Language Typology (EUROTYP), together with its Programme Director Ekkehard König and dozens of linguists from all over
Europe, whose interest in Lezgian has always kept me motivated.
Finally, I have to thank Hans-Jürgen Sasse, George Smith, Stefanie
Eschenlohr, and Albrecht Hofheinz for help of various kinds.

9.5.1. The copulas
The standard copula ja 'be' (cf. 17.1-3.) and the five local copulas (cf. 17.6.)
awa 'be in', gwa 'be near', gala 'be behind', kwa 'be under', ala 'be on'
(with their Continuative variants ama, guma, galama, kuma, alama, cf.
17.6.6.) are defective in that they allow the formation of only a subset of inflectional verb forms. They have a Present tense, a Past tense formed with -j,
a participle also formed with -j, a suffixal negative form -6, and a converb
form in -z. Thus, they lack an Imperfective, a Future, and all the forms
based on the Aorist stem and the Masdar stem. The copulas also diverge
from regular verb forms in that they have suffixal negation even in their
converb and their participle. The participial suffix in negated copulas is -ir,
making the Past tense completely homonymous with the participle (in regular verbs, only the non-negated Past tense is homonymous with the corresponding participle).
The standard copula ja has some suppletive forms, the other copulas are
inflected like awa.
The standard copula:

they are used very rarely and it is unclear whether and how their meaning
differs from the simple Present form. Only Continuative Imperfective
forms (Ja-zma, ama-zma)
are reasonably common.
The forms that do not exist are replaced by the corresponding forms of
the verb Jtun 'become, be'.
9.5.2. Verbs lacking a Masdar and Aorist stem
The verbs k'an- 'want', kiö'e- 'afraid', Hi- 'know7, t'a- 'hurt' share two important features: (a) they lack a Masdar and an Aorist stem, and (b) their Future
in -da has a non-future, non-habitual, present state meaning. At least k'anand kiö'e- seem to be adjectival in origin. See 8.1.3.1. for related phenomena
in adjectives.
9.5.2.1. k'an- 'love, need, want'. The verb k'an- is based on the adjective k'an
'dear'. It has three verbal forms: an Imperfective k'anzawa,
a Future
k'anda
(as well as all forms that are based on these, i.e. participles, Past
forms, negative forms), and a converb k'anz (negative ta-k'anz).
The
Future has present state meaning. Thus, (292a) and (292b) mean more or
less the same, and a third way to express the same meaning is by means of
the adjective k'an plus the standard copula (292c).

9.10.3. Archaic Past Future
The Archaic Past Future is formed from the Imperfective stem with the suffix -dir (negative -öir), i.e. -di plus the Past suffix -(i)r, which otherwise occurs only after the negative suffix -6.

Discourse particles express various subtle pragmatic meanings that are hard
to render in a language like English which makes little use of discourse particles. In this section, some example sentences are also accompanied by
German translations where a German equivalent is available.
Lezgian discourse particles generally occupy a marginal position in the
sentence. Most of them are sentence-final (after the finite verb), but a few
are sentence-initial.
The question particles bes, jarab, meger, Sal, q'wan, which are also discourse particles, are treated in 23.5.
13.3.1. The particle matt
This particle is used in Imperative sentences to express a weak exhortation
or request.
(624) a. Televizor
TVagal-aclose-IMPVman. (K86,2:7)
PT'Why don't you switch off the TV?'
b. Sa maxone fairy.taleaqhaj-atell-IMPVman. (K85,7:4)
PTTlease tell [us] a fairy tale.'
In declarative sentences, man expresses a conclusion reached on the basis of
indirect evidence. It often occurs in conjunction with sentence-initial ak'
Stajila 'hence, lit. since it is so'.
(625) Ak' ita-ji-la,
sobe-AOP-TEMPSafiga
SafigaDewlet.a-nruäDewlet-GENdaughterjaCOPman. (N88:80)

Such conclusions sometimes occur in the form of questions expecting a positive answer:

sobe-AOP-TEMPgila kwe-qhblektrik.di-nnowelectricity-GEN l i g h t be-FUTyou.all-POESSekwze-daman?
PT'So now you-all will have electric light?' (J89:22)
In other contexts, man means 'after all'.

This sentence-final particle is used especially when a negative answer is expected.
(1212) a. Wuöwhat: A BSmesJelaproblemawa

Exclamations can have the syntactic form of parametric questions, especially
with hiq'wan 'how much':

A peculiar type of Immediate-Anterior clause uses a reduplicated converb
form where the second component is negated. Literally,
£ana-ta£ana
means 'having become, not having become', but this construction is used in
the sense 'as soon as ... became' (cf. Gadiiev 1963:135). A similar construction
exists in the neighboring Turkic languages.
(1076) a. XweSi
happyfeq'i,mullahnäni[evening£a-na=ta-£a-naaqat-na.become-AOC =NEG-become-AOC] appear-AOR'The happy mullah appeared as soon as it became evening.'

The reduplication plus negation of the second component and the non-negative meaning of the whole construction reminds one of the special construction with the Archaic Imperfective participle (9.10.4.)21.4. Temporal clauses38721.4.4. The Graduative converb -(i)rdawaj
This form expresses a gradual development of the adverbial clause situation
that correlates with a development in the superordinate clause situation.
Formally, the suffix -rdawaj looks like an Adelative case form of the substantivized Archaic Imperfective participle (cf. 9.10.4.).

"29015. Verbal valenceBut how can we be sure that we are really dealing with two different valence patterns here, not merely with a freely omitted Ergative argument in
(787a) (cf. 15.5. on such free omission of arguments)? Indeed, Mel'iuk (1988)
claims that there are no labile verbs in Lezgian and that (787a) has the same
syntactic structure as the sentences in (778) in 15.5. Conversely, Mejlanova &
Talibov (1977) subsume both cases under labile verbs. Since the Ergative argument of any transitive verb can be freely omitted, they arrive at the astronomical number of ""more than 150"" labile verbs.
But contrary to Mel'Cuk's and Mejlanova & Talibov's claims, there are in
fact good reasons to treat the absence of an Ergative argument differently in
labile verbs and in free omission. The arguments come from the scope of
negation (15.6.1.), from imperatives (15.6.2.), and from the Involuntary
Agent Construction (15.6.3.).
15.6.1. The argument from the scope of negation
This argument is semantic. Consider a sentence like (788), where the labile
verb is negated.
(788)Indija.d-aIndia-INESSkal-ercow-PLreq'i-zwa-ö.kill/die-IMPF-NEC(i) I n India cows don't die.' (intransitive labile)
(ii) I n India cows are not killed/one doesn't kill cows.'
(free omission of the subject)
This sentence is ambiguous: On the first reading, the verb is intransitive
and no argument is omitted; on the second reading, the verb is transitive,
and the agent is omitted. This ambiguity affects all sentences with labile
verbs in which there is no Ergative NP present—e.g. (787a) could also mean
The pot was broken/one broke the pot.' But in such ordinary cases it is difficult to prove that there is real ambiguity in Lezgian, and not just two different Russian or English equivalents that correspond to no difference in
Lezgian. However, when the verb is negated, as in (788), the semantic difference is so striking that translation is not necessary to bring out the ambiguity. On the intransitive reading, Indian cows are (falsely) said to be immortal, while on the transitive reading only that part of the lexical meaning of
the verb is negated which specifies that death is caused by an agent. All native speakers that I consulted confirmed that (788) can have two meanings,
the true meaning ('are not killed') and the false meaning ('do not die'). This
shows that the meaning 'caused by an agent' is indeed part of the lexical
meaning of a the transitive member of a labile verb pair.
15.6.2. The argument from Imperatives
Another piece of evidence for the distinction between labile verbs and free
omission of arguments is the behavior of imperatives. As would be expected on semantic grounds, the Imperative addressee is the Absolutive argument of intransitive verbs or the Ergative argument of transitive verbs.","[309, 310]"

The following list gives a complete overview of verbal inflectional categories. We will say that the participles, the converbs, the Infinitive, the
Masdar, and the Periphrasis forms are non-finite, and that the remaining
verb forms are finite. Within the group of finite verb forms, the Hortative,
the Optative, the Imperative, and the Prohibitive will be said to be nonindicative, the others are indicative.

(i) The suffix -j/-ir derives Past forms from non-Past indicative forms (-j
in affirmative forms, -ir in forms following the negative suffix -£).
(ii) Participles are derived from non-Past indicative forms by means of
the suffix -j. (These participles are identical to the corresponding Past forms
when they are not negated.) An exception is the Aorist participle, which is
derived directly from the Aorist stem.
(iii) Indicative forms are negated by the suffix -6 following the aspect suffix (and preceding the past suffix -ir), whereas non-finite forms and the
Hortative and the Optative are negated with a iV-prefix or periphrastically.
In the following subsections (9.3.1.-5.) each verb form is described in more
detail.
9.3.1. Forms derived from the Masdar stem
9.3.1.1. Masdar. The Masdar is a verbal noun. Its suffix is -n in strong verbs
and -un in weak verbs. As a nominal form, the Masdar can be inflected for
case and number (oblique stem -i, plural -ar). A few verbs whose base consists of a single consonant have a second Masdar form that is formed by
reduplicating that consonant after the suffix -n, so that the pattern C-V-n-VC results, e.g.:
±u-n
fi-n
gu-n
gu-n
q'u-n
q'i-n=

~

gu-n-ug
q'u-n-uq'
q'i-n-iq''being'
'going'
'giving'
'bringing'
'holding'
'dying'9.3.1.2. Optative. Its suffix is -raj both in weak verbs and in strong verbs. An
alternative suffix that is used much more rarely is -j/-uj (-j in strong verbs,
-uj in weak verbs).
9.3.1.3. Imperative. There are several different ways of forming the
Imperative. Most strong verbs reduplicate the last consonant of the stem,
e.g.:
St-u-n
öüx-ü-nx-u-A
öüx-il-x'become'
'wash'When the last consonant of the stem is an r, then the first consonant is
reduplicated, e.g.:
xur-u-n
q'ur-u-nxur-u-x
q'ur-u-q''weave'
'dr/9.3. Verbal inflectional categories 129
Four verbs form their Imperative by means of a suffix -r.
gutu-n
kut-u-n
tu-n
tu-ngutu-r
kutu-r
tu-r
tu-r'attach'
'put under'
'leave'
'put'In three verbs the Imperative is identical to the Masdar stem:
aku-n
ak-u
'see'
ö'ug-u-n
ö'ug-u
'pull'
qaö-u-n
qaö-u
'take'
Some verbs have suppletive Imperatives:
atu-n
xtu-n
awu-n
qhuwu-n
fi-n
qhfi-n
gu-n
wug-u-n
t'ii-ncome
'come back'

ne?","[146, 147, 148, 149]"
"9.3. Verbal inflectional categories 131
9.3.2.7. Posterior converb. Its suffix is -daldi both in strong verbs and in
weak verbs. It can be thought of as derived from the Future, to which it is
also semantically related. The suffix -(da)ldi is in some way related to the
Superelative case suffix -Idi, which also sometimes means 'until' (7.2.2.15.).
9.3.2.8. Graduative converb. Its suffix is -rdawaj
in strong verbs and
-irdawaj in weak verbs. It seems to be originally the Adelative form of a
substantivized Imperfective participle in -r (9.10.4.), but the semantic development is obscure.
9.3.2.9. Immediate-Anterior converb -z(a)maz. The form is -zamaz in weak
verbs and -zmaz in strong verbs. Formally, it looks like a secondary converb
formed from the Continuative Imperfective, but this does not fit the
meaning very well. Am fizma means 'she is still going', but am
fizmaz
means 'as soon as she goes'.
9.3.3. Forms derived from the Aorist stem
9.3.3.1. Aorist. Its suffix is -na both for strong verbs and for weak verbs. The
affirmative Aorist is homophonous with the Aorist converb (9.3.3.4.).
9.3.3.2. Aorist participle. Its suffix is -aj for weak verbs (or rarely and archaically -ur) and -r/-j/-ji for strong verbs. The form -r is used after a high
thematic vowel (u, ü), and -j/-ji is used after a low thematic vowel (a, β).
The form -j is used after polysyllabic stems, -ji is used after monosyllabic
stems:
awu-na
t'ii-na
ata-na
qhwa-na
fe-naawu-r
t'ü-r
ata-j
qhwa-ji
fe-jiNote that verbs like kitin 'write', qhfin
vowel by syncope count as disyllabic:
k£e-na
qhfe-nak£e-j
q^fe-j'(having) done'
'(having) eaten'
'having come'
'(having) drunk'
'having gone'
'go away' which have lost their stem
'(having) written'
'having gone away'9.3.3.3. Perfect and Continuative Perfect. Their suffixes are -nwa l-nma in
strong verbs and -nawa/-nama
in weak verbs. They are originally complex
forms built on the Aorist converb plus the copulas aw a and ama,
respectively, completely parallel to the Imperfective and the Continuative
Imperfective ( a t a n a 'having come' + awa 'is' > atanawa > atanwa
'has
come'). Since the Continuative forms are rarer, their degree of
grammaticization is apparently lower and non-syncopated forms like
ksanama
'is still asleep' (instead of standard ksanma)
are sometimes
heard.","[150, 151]"
"OOP'I'm afraid of you.'
Like k'ani, kii'e is also used attributively (e.g., kii'e ajal 'a child that is
afraid'), but there is no prefixal negative form. The missing forms are replaced by kii'e £un.",[158]

"16.1. Grammatical relations: the notion of subject
16.1.1. Subject properties
Notions such as subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. (i.e. grammatical
relations, or syntactic functions) are generally used sparingly in this book.
The reason is that their use is not as straightforward in role-dominated languages like Lezgian as it is in reference-dominated languages like English.
There are very few generalizations that need to be stated over grammatical
relations.
The subject is the most important grammatical relation, and I will mostly
be concerned with this notion in this section. There is some evidence, albeit
rather slight, that a notion of subject is needed in Lezgian grammar. The arguments that have subject status are the Absolutive argument of intransitive verbs, the Ergative argument of transitive verbs, and the Dative argument in the Affective Construction.
However, most of the properties that often serve to identify subjects in
other languages do not uniquely identify subjects in Lezgian. Following
Keenan (1976), we can divide subject properties into coding properties and
behavioral properties. Coding properties are case marking, subject-verb
agreement, word order and the like. Case marking would of course identify
the Absolutive argument both of intransitive and of transitive sentences as
the subject. However, case marking is not normally considered sufficient
evidence for grammatical relations in languages with ergative case marking.
Subject-verb agreement is lacking in Lezgian. There is some weak evidence
from word order that Ergative agents and Dative experiencers are both subjects, because both precede the Absolutive argument in the unmarked order:
(799) Alfija.di

(800) MuTminat.a-z
Mu'minat-DATIbrahim
Ibrahim'Mu'minat saw Ibrahim.'aku-na.see-AOR16.1. Grammatical relations295However, since word order is very flexible (especially the order of arguments and clausal adjuncts, cf. 16.2.), this is very weak evidence. It is just as
possible that the true word order generalization is a strong tendency for
topics to precede non-topics, and for agents and experiencers to be topics.
Behavioral properties have to do with behavior in valence-changing (or
relation-changing) operations and with behavior in various types of coreferential constructions. Valence-changing operations do not yield any criteria
in Lezgian, because the only valence-changing verbal categories, the
Causative and the Anticausative (cf. 10.1.-2.), affect only one type of argument (Causatives are formed only from intransitive verbs, Anticausatives
only from transitive verbs). It is only in coreferential constructions that we
begin to get some clearer evidence for a notion of subject in Lezgian, as discussed in the following two sections.
16.1.2. Evidence from coreferential constructions
Let us first consider constructions involving omission under coreference.
In such constructions, there is a controller and an (omitted) target. For instance, in English Maria promised Kim to meet Hans, the subject of to
meet is omitted under coreference with Maria; i.e. the subject of to meet is
the target and Maria (the subject of promised) is the controller of the omission.
Across languages, the controller of coreferential omission is very often
the subject. In Lezgian, too, subjects are commonly controllers. In (801a-c),
an Ergative argument, an intransitive Absolutive argument, and a Dative
experiencer control a complement clause target.

However, not only Ergatives, intransitive Absolutives, and Dative experiencers can control omitted targets. Other arguments that are salient in the
clause can do so as well, such as Genitive experiencers (802a) or Subelative
arguments (802b).

"7.3. Nominal derivation1097.3.3. Conversion from adjectives
Conversion from adjectives may be considered a third type of nominal
derivation. In general, adjectives have to be substantivized before they can
be used as nouns (e.g. qacu 'green', qacu-di
'green one', see 8.1.1.).
However, in some cases adjectives are directly converted to nouns, without
any additional morphology.
(244) wahSi
zehil
muq'wa'wild animal'
'youth'
'relative'wahSi
zehil
muq'wa'wild'
'young'
'close'These nouns inflect regularly like other nouns (Singular oblique stem iehildi, Plural zehil-ar, etc.). Conversion from adjectives is frequent and productive only with adjectives denoting negative human qualities, e.g.
(245) tempel

mut'laq'
merdimazar'lazybones'
'naughty child'
'miser'
'harmful person'tempel
nadinz
mut'laq'
merdimazarlazy7
'naughty'
'stingy'
'harmful'Nationality adjectives exhibit similar behavior (8.1.3.).
7.3.4. Echo compounds
As in many other languages of the area, echo compounds are formed by
reduplicating nouns in such a way that the onset of the first syllable of the
second member is replaced by m-. The meaning of such Ν rti-N' echo compounds is 'N and similar things'.
(246) sik'-mik'

"9.8. Functions of non-indicative finite verb forms1499.8. Functions of non-indicative finite verb forms
The non-indicative finite verb forms are the Imperative, the Prohibitive,
the Hortative, and the Optative.
9.8.1. Imperative
The Imperative has the usual range of meanings, i.e. command, request,
admonition, etc. The Imperative cannot be negated, the Prohibitive (see
9.8.2. below) is used instead.
(324) a. Tadiquickqaöu-mir,take-PROHIBk'walax.di-wsifteq^san-dizfirstfahum-a,good-ADVthink-IMPVaxpathenegeö'. (K87,l:5)work-ADESSstart(IMPV)'Don't hurry, first think well, then start work.'

highxkwakqaw.a-lroof-SRESShik'howksu-da-j-t'asleep-FUT-PST-CND](H77:4)return:IMPV'Remember how we used to sleep on our high roof.'
The second person pronoun is commonly omitted in the Imperative
(making the Imperative form indeterminate as to the number of the addressee(s)), but it is also commonly retained, without any special emphasis.
(324) c. Wunayou:ERGbagi&lamiS-a,
forgive-IMPVbuba. (J89:77)
father'Forgive me, father.'
Apparently the Imperative is not different at all grammatically from indicative verb forms in this respect. As noted in 22.1., personal pronouns are
generally used, but if the context allows it, they may be omitted. In
Imperative contexts, reference to the second person can be inferred from the
context, but when the speaker wants to make the number of the addressee
(singular or plural) clear, he or she may choose not to omit the pronoun.
9.8.2. Prohibitive
The Prohibitive is the negative counterpart of the Imperative.

21.4.39.10. Archaic verb forms
Three tense-aspect categories that are described in Uslar (1896) do not occur
in the modern standard language. These are referred to here as the ""archaic""
tense-aspects, although it is not quite clear whether they have really become
obsolete in the meantime or whether they are restricted to non-standard dialects. Furthermore, there is an Imperfective participle that is used very
rarely and seems to be a relic from an earlier time.
9.10.1. Archaic Preterit
The Archaic Preterit is formed from the Aorist stem with the suffix -ra or
-jal-aja. The distribution of these suffixes is parallel to the distribution of
the Aorist participle suffixes -r and -ji/-j (9.3.3.2.). This suggests that the
Archaic Preterit is derived from the Aorist participle by means of a suffix -a
(perhaps cognate with the copula ja?). Some examples:
Masdar

awun

fin

qaöur
awur
±aji

slightly from the Aorist in that it conveys a nuance of surprise, e.g.
(356) a. C'ininjisawadantir,t h i s . y e a r y e a r favorableammatexil-arCOP:PST butpisgrain-PLbadita-ja.be-APRETThis year was favorable, but (surprisingly) the crops were bad.'

(Topuria 1959:108)
9.10.2. Archaic FutureThe Archaic Future is formed with the suffix -di (negated -(i)t) from the
Imperfective stem, e.g.
Masdar
akun
jtun
tamaSunArchaic Future
akuiadi
zedi
tamaSdinegated Archaic Future
akwaö
zei
tamaSiö'see'
'be, become'
'look'According to Uslar (1896:§198), it is less assertive in predicting a future event
and occurs mainly in the apodosis of a conditional sentence, e.g.
(357) a. Gila wun
nowada-nyou:ABS he-GENk'wali-zSa-ji-t'a,house-DAT go-AOP-CNDamk'wal-ehe:ABS house-INESSze-di.be-AFUT'If you go to his house now, he will be at home.'

you, too (lit. will come on your head).' (Topuria 1959:111)
The Archaic Future is not as completely absent from the modern standard
language as the Archaic Preterit. It is occasionally used, especially in
negative form and with the verb ±un 'be', e.g.
(358) a. Wirik'-eixtin gaf-aryourGEN heart-INESS suchword-PLze-t (N88:87)
be-AFUT.NEG'There are no such words in your heart.'

In many cases, no marked focus seems to be present in the verbal predicative participle construction. It it is not clear, for example, how the following
sentences differ in meaning from the corresponding finite sentences.

Often such verbal predicative participles without marked focus are used in
emphatic negative sentences, especially where 'never' is expressed or understood. It is not at all clear how this usage relates to the focus-marking function described above.

The verbal predicative participle construction bears an obvious resemblance to cleft sentences, which will be described in the next section. Cleft
sentences also serve to focus a constituent, and they also involve a substantivized participle. The verbal predicative participle construction seems to
have evolved in some way from the cleft construction, but the details are
obscure.","[370, 371]"

18.2.4. Negated disjunction: ja...ja /neither...nor'
When the verb of a clause is negated, emphatic disjunction of the ja...ja
has the effect of negative conjunction:

9.8.3. Hortative
The Hortative expresses exhortations to first person singular (326) and plural (327) addressees. The Hortative is often accompanied by the sentence-initial particle Sa (lit. 'come!', 13.3.9.).

"2.2. Lezgian dialects
In contrast to some of the other major Daghestanian languages (especially
Dargwa and Avar), Lezgian shows relatively little internal dialectal variation. Divergences from the standard language (which is described in this
grammar) are relatively minor, and all dialects are mutually intelligible.
This section gives a brief overview of the dialect division of Lezgian and
some of the more salient divergences from the standard language.
2.2.1. Dialect division
Although some details are disputed, there is broad agreement among
Lezgian dialectologists that the main subdivision of dialects is threefold: the
Küre dialect group, the Axceh dialect group, and the Quba dialect group (cf.
Gajdarov 1963, Mejlanova 1964).
The Küre dialect group is located in what used to be the Kjurinskij okrug
with its capital Kasumkent/Q'asumxür (and before that the Küre khanate
with its capital Kurax/Q'urah), i.e. the present Magaramkentskij, SulejmanStal'skij (Kasumkentskij), Kuraxskij, and Xivskij rayons. According to
Mejlanova (1964), the Küre dialect group is subdivided into the Güne,
Q'urah and Jark'i dialects. The Jark'i dialect is spoken in what used to be the
Jarkinskij uiastok in the northeast of the former Kjurinskij okrug, now the
southern part of the Xivskij rayon and the northern part of the SulejmanStal'skij (Kasumkentskij) rayon. A variety belonging to the Jark'i dialect was
described by Petr K. Uslar in his ground-breaking Lezgian grammar (1896).
The Q'urah dialect is spoken in what used to be the Kuraxskij uiastok of
the Kjurinskij okrug, now the Kuraxskij rayon.
The Güne dialect is spoken in what used to be the Gjunejskij uiastok of
the Kjurinskij okrug, now the southern part of the Sulejman-Stal'skij
(Kasumkentskij) rayon and the Magaramkentskij rayon. The Güne dialect
served as the basis for the standard language (cf. Mejlanova 1957, 1959, 1970).
The Axceh dialect group is located in what used to be the Samurskij
okrug with its capital Axty/Axceh, now the Axtynskij rayon. Mejlanova
(1964) calls it the Samur dialect group and subdivides it into the Axceh dialect and the Doquzpara dialect. The Axceh dialect is spoken in the western
part of the Axtynskij rayon and in adjacent parts of the Rutul'skij rayon (cf.
Genko 1926, Gajdarov 1961). The Doquzpara dialect is spoken in the former
Dokuzparinskij uiastok of the Samurskij okrug; now the eastern part of the
Axtynskij rayon.
The Quba dialect group is located in what used to be the Kubinskij uezd
of the Baku gubernija (province), now several rayons in northern
Azerbaijan. See Genko (1929), GadZiev (1957a), Saadiev (1961),
Gjul'magomedoν (1966), (1967), (1968), Mejlanova (1981) for several studies
of the Quba dialects.
Furthermore, several authors set up various smaller ""mixed"" dialects
that have a special status and do not strictly belong to one of the major di-2.2. Lezgian dialects21alects, e. g. the Fij dialect (Mejlanova 1964:386-394, Abdul2amalov 1965), the
Ceper (DZaba) dialect (Ganieva 1972a, b, 1981, 1983, 1985), the Quruä dialect
(Mejlanova 1964:395-399), the Gilig dialect (Mejlanova 1964:353-358), and the
Gelxen dialect (Mejlanova 1964:358-365).
2.2.2. Some salient divergent features of the dialects
2.2.2.1. Phonology. The vowel inventory:
Besides the vowels of the standard language, several dialects (especially of
the Axceh dialect group) have the high back unrounded vowel /i/. In these
dialects, the relation between Λ/ and /u/ is similar to the relation between /i/
and /y/ in the standard language (cf. 4.5.). E.g.
Axceh dialect

'ten'

'these'Furthermore, pharyngealization of vowels is widespread in several dialects,
especially in the environment of uvular obstruents and pharyngeal consonants. According to Ganieva (1972a:209), The Ceper (D2aba) dialect has the
front rounded vowel /0/, e.g. /m0rth/ 'barberry', /s0l/ 'downpour'.
The consonant inventory:
Several dialects have the pharyngeal fricatives /h/ (voiceless) and Λ/
(voiced). They mostly occur in Arabic loanwords, but sometimes also in native words, e.g.

special dento-labialized obstruents (of the type that is found in Tabasaran
and Abkhaz).
The voiced velar fricative /γ/ occurs in the Jark'i dialect, and the uvular
voiced stop /G/ occurs in the Güne dialect.

some dialects. For example, instead of the alternation ejective/aspirated
(5.9.), the Axceh dialect has the alternation unaspirated/aspirated.

"5.5. Vowel Harmony alternations
Because of the phonotactic restrictions of Vowel Harmony (cf. 4.4.), native
prefixes and stress-bearing suffixes show alternations. In affixes with a low
vowel, /a/ and /e/ alternate according to Palatal Vowel Harmony (in one case,
the Inelative suffix -äjl-aj, /aj a n d /ae/ alternate); in affixes with a high
vowel, /u/, l'\l, and lyl alternate according to Palatal and Labial Vowel
Harmony. The alternating affixes are most conveniently represented in
their archiphonemic form. In this work, A is used to represent a low vowel
(/a/ or /e/), and U is used to represent a high vowel (/u/, /i/, or lyl).

"Jusuf(ERG) work-IMPF.CONT'Jusuf is still working.'

on the verb:

work-IMPF.CONT-NEG'Jusuf is no longer working.'
The Continuative is often not the only element in the sentence that
expresses the meaning 'still'. The particles hele (also 'already', cf. above),
helelig, and gilani (gila 'now' plus -ni 'also, even') can be used to make the
'still' meaning more explicit. Hele is illustrated in (507a), helelig in (507b),
and gilani in (507c).

12.1.3. Causal adverbs
There are a few causal adverbs which are characterized by the suffix -la and
which are derived from adjectives denoting a transitory state (especially a
bodily or psychological experience).

Degree adverbs mostly modify adjectives (cf. 14.5.2.). Formally, they are
rather heterogeneous. The Lezgian equivalent of 'very' is lap or (rarely)
aieb, or gzaf 'much'. 'Little' is t'imil or iizwi, 'somewhat' is sa q'adar. A
few examples:21212. Adverbs and postpositions(511) a. Abur.u-kajkürü[they-SBHLshortmaqala-jargu-narticle-PLaiebgive-MSD] veryqhsangoodkar

c. Ada-ηshe-GENdinsat'imil jaru £a-na. (R66:13)face one littleredbecome-AORTier face blushed a little (lit. became a little red).'
The demonstrative degree adverb 'so' is aq'wan:

Of course, degree adverbs may also modify adverbs, as in (512) and (513).

12.1.5. Other adverbs
12.1.5.1. Solitary Aorist converbs. There are several manner adverbs which
end in -na and thus look like Aorist converb forms, but whose root is never
used as a verb in other forms. They all have a sound symbolic form.

and putting -ba- between the two copies of the noun. The meaning is distributive, 'X by X'.
(515) harfba-harf
k'walba-k'wal'letter by letter'
'house by house'harf

Lezgian adpositions are exlusively postpositions. Postpositions are easily
distinguished from case suffixes: they are written separately, are longer, and
generally have internal structure. In addition, postpositions generally combine with inflected forms of nouns.
For most postpositions it is synchronically transparent that they are
derived from spatial adverbs (12.2.1.), spatial nouns (12.2.2.), or converbal
verb forms (12.2.3.), and they still share many morphological and syntactic
properties with the forms which they were derived from. In other words,
postpositions in Lezgian exhibit a low degree of grammaticization, which is
hardly surprising in view of the large number of highly grammaticized case
markers. Among the synchronically non-derived postpositions (12.2.4.),
only one or two are not loanwords.
12.2.1. Postpositions that are identical to spatial adverbs
Most spatial postpositions are identical in form to spatial adverbs (cf. 12.1.1.).
They are either derived from the spatial adverbs, or they are perhaps
derived in the same way from the same spatial nouns as the spatial adverbs.
Generally both the Essive and the Elative forms are used as postpositions,
the meaning difference being completely parallel to that in the local cases
(cf. 7.2.2.5.-18.).
As one would expect for postpositions based on nouns, they generally
.govern the Genitive case of their argument. However, some postpositions
take Absolutive, Dative, Superelative or Inessive arguments.
12.2.1.1. qene 'inside; within' (cf. 12.1.1.1.) takes a Genitive argument. The
meaning is most often temporal, 'within'.

less the same forms as k'an: an Imperfective kiö'ezwa, a Future kiö'eda
with the same (non-future, non-habitual) meaning, and a simple stem form
plus copula:

"16.3. Clausal adjuncts
Most of the clausal adjuncts (=adverbials) are described in other places in
this grammar, especially in the sections on the functions of the cases (7.2.2.)
on adverbs (12.1.), on postpositions (12.2.), and on adverbial clauses (Ch. 21).
This section deals with clausal a d j u n c t s f r o m a semantic
(onomasiological, function-to-form) point of view. Since detailed description of the forms and illustration is provided elsewhere, much of this section consists of mere cross-references. It can largely be regarded as a systematic index to the form-to-function parts dispersed over the book where adverbiale are described.
Adverbials can be divided into two main semantic groups: predication
adverbials and sentence adverbials. Predication adverbials are dealt with in
sections 16.3.1.-16.3.3, sentence adverbials in sections 16.3.4.-16.3.5.
16.3.1. Spatial adverbials
Spatial notions can be decomposed into two components: type of location
(e.g. interior, posterior, inferior, etc.) and type of orientation (position,
source, path, direction) (cf. Comrie & Smith 1977). The type of location is expressed by one of the localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In) or by the stem30416. Syntax of the clauseof a postposition. Orientation is expressed by one of the local cases (Essive,
Elative, Directive), or by an oblique-case form of a postposition.
Furthermore, there are various spatial adverbs that are often formally identical to postpositions.
Position is expressed by an Essive case or by the basic form of a postposition; source and path are expressed by an Elative case or by an Elative form
of a postposition; direction is occasionally by a Directive case or a Directive
form of a postposition, but it is more commonly expressed in the same way
as position (except in the most general type of location, where direction is
expressed by the Dative case). Below only the expression of position is given
for most of the locations.
16.3.1.1. General location ('at'): In localization (7.1.2.3.). Position: Inessive
case (7.2.2.17.); source/path: Inelative case (7.2.2.18.); direction: Dative case
(7.2.2.4.). The Post localization (7.2.2.8.-10.) is also sometimes used with general locative meaning.
16.3.1.2. Proximate ('near'): Ad localization (7.2.2.5.), postpositions
muq'uw, q'iliw (12.2.1.8.-9., 12.2.2.2.).pataw,16.3.1.3. Interior ('in(side)'): In localization (7.2.2.17.-18.); postposition qen(12.2.1.1.).

"101. Introduction1.3.3. Grammatical terminology
Another feature that contributes to the user-friendliness of this grammar is
the avoidence of opaque grammatical category labels such as ""5th Elative
case"" or ""3rd Past tense"". Instead, grammatical labels with some mnemonic
descriptive content have been chosen, such as ""Superelative case"" and ""Past
Perfect"". This meant that traditional Lezgian terminology had to be abandoned in several cases. However, the traditional terminology itself is by no
means uniform. For example, Gajdarov's (1987a) textbook differs substantially from the earlier standard accounts of Talibov & GadZiev (1966) and
Mejlanova (1967). Other works such as Zirkov (1941) and Moor (1985) use
still different terms.
The following table is a comparative list of the most important terms that
are most widespread in Russian-language studies of Lezgian and of the terminology used in this grammar (my terminology is closest to Mel'iuk's
1988a).","[29, 30]"
"1309. Verbal inflection9.3.2. Forms derived from the Imperfective stem
9.3.2.1. Infinitive (or Imperfective converb). Its suffix is -z in strong verbs
and -iz in weak verbs. Since the Infinitive is also used in converbal function, it will sometimes be referred to as the Imperfective converb. There is
no formal difference associated with the two functions, except that the converb is sometimes reduplicated (cf. 21.2. for details). Unlike the Masdar, the
Infinitive cannot be inflected like a noun. In view of its likely origin in a
Dative case marker, this is not surprising.
9.3.2.2. Imperfective. Its suffix is -zwa in strong verbs and -zawa in weak
verbs. This form is a rather recent formation from the Imperfective converb
plus the locative copula awa:
gu-z 'giving'
kat-iz 'running'+ awa 'is'
+ awa 'is'>
>guzwa
kat-zawa'is giving',
'is running'In weak verbs, alternative forms are sometimes found where the a is
deleted instead of the i: kat-izwa (especially in older texts, e.g. Gad2iev
1954). The Imperfective suffix is also occasionally used on adjectives
(8.1.3.2.).
9.3.2.3. Continuative Imperfective. Its suffix is -zma in strong verbs and zama in weak verbs. This form has resulted from a combination of the
Imperfective converb plus the cont^ative copula ama (cf. 17.6.6.1.).
9.3.2.4. Future. Its suffix is -da both in strong and in weak verbs. The fact
that it has the two rather disparate meanings future and habitual (9.6.2.)
seems to have a diachronic explanation: Before the Imperfective forms
came into existence, it used to be a very general non-past form. After the
Imperfective took over first the progressive and later the general present
meanings, all that was left for this form was the future and habitual meanings. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that a few irregular stative
verbs still have the present-tense use of the form in -da (see 9.5.2.1.-4.,
8.1.3.1.).
9.3.2.5. Hortative. Its suffix is -n in strong verbs and -in in weak verbs. Note
that the Hortative of strong verbs is identical in form to the Periphrasis
form (9.3.5.) in Imperfective-stem forms.
9.3.2.6. Prohibitive. Its suffix is -mir both in strong verbs and in weak verbs.
This suffix -mir has been grammaticized from the old Prohibitive of awun
'do', mijir 'don't do' (the current form is iji-mir). This form, m-iji-r, consists
of an old Prohibitive prefix m-, the Imperfective stem -iji-, and the participial suffix -r (9.10.4.). Topuria (1959:118) cites similar archaic or dialectal
forms like me-qwa-r 'don't go', ma-gu-r 'don't give'.
Like the Imperative, the Prohibitive cannot be negated, and one could in
fact regard the Prohibitive simply as the negative form of the Imperative.
This is not done here because it would complicate the description of the
morphology considerably (the Imperative is derived from the Masdar stem,
while the Prohibitive is derived from the Imperfective stem).","[149, 150]"

'meet'(cf. Turkic όοδ 'head')

the derived verb. In this way, -lamiSun has become a productive suffix
deriving transitive verbs from nouns (mainly loanwords). The meaning
often corresponds to English -ize.

True compounds of noun (or adjective) plus verb occur only with the two
verbs awun 'do, make' and £un 'be, become'. Their meaning in the noun +
verb combinations is often so general that it reduces to the transitive/intransitive distinction. Verbal compounds are particularly common
with loanwords. A few examples are shown in (405)-(406).

"16.2. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order,
clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. However,
whereas head-final word order is obligatory in noun phrases and adjective
phrases, verb-final order is only the preferred word order in independent
sentences. Alternative orders are possible, especially in the colloquial language. The order of the other major constituents of the clause (arguments
and adjuncts) is quite free, although there is a strong tendency for the subject to precede the other arguments.",[318]

expresses an internal subjective motivation rather than an objective cause, reflecting the original meaning

Verbal valence15.1. Verbal valence patterns: introduction
Verbal valence patterns are represented here in the following format:
V (ACASEI/ BCASE2/···)where V stands for the verb, and A and Β stand for arguments in the case
indicated by the subscript (the order of the arguments is arbitrary). The letters used as variables for arguments are arbitrary and serve only to distinguish different arguments. However, I will often use letters that can be
thought of as mnemonic for particular semantic roles (A: ""agent"", T:
""theme"", L: ""location"", E: ""experiencer"", R: ""recipient""). Otherwise no attempt is made to systematically describe the semantic roles expressed by the
arguments; this information is left implicit in the translations of the individual verbs.
Let us take a concrete example: The verb ilisun has the valence pattern:
V (AERG/ TABS/ LSRESS)and means Ά presses L by putting Τ in contact with L (= A presses L with
T)'. This means that it has an (""agent"") argument in the Ergative case which
corresponds to the subject of 'press' in the translation, a (""theme"") argument
in the Absolutive case which corresponds to the object of 'put in contact
with', and a (""location"") argument in the Superessive case corresponding to
the object of 'press'. This is all the information contained in a valence
frame, and it is sufficient, for example, to obtain the correct translation of
the following sentence:
(717) Adahe(ERG)knopka.da-lbutton-SRESSt'ubilis-na. (R66:9)finger press-AOR'He pressed the button by putting his finger in contact with it.'
(= 'He pressed the button with his finger.'
Lit. 'He pressed his finger on the button.')15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patterns
There are very tight restrictions on possible verbal valence patterns, especially the following:
(i) There are no verbs that take fewer than one argument. Weather situations (rain, snow, etc.), which are expressed by zero-argument verbs in many15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patterns269languages, are expressed as 'rain is falling' (marf qwazwa),
etc. (However,
predicative adjectives may be subjectless, cf. 17.3.)
(ii) There are no verbs that take more than three arguments.
(iii) Most of the valence patterns contain an Absolutive argument. There
are a few exceptions which belong to the ""non-standard valence patterns""
and are discussed in 15.4. below.
(iv) For each intransitive valence pattern with an Absolutive argument
there is a corresponding transitive valence pattern which contains the same
arguments plus an Ergative argument.
(v) Except for the purely adnominal Genitive case and the rare Directive
cases, all cases occur in at least one valence pattern together with an
Absolutive argument (but see 15.3.15. for ""Genitive arguments"").
Thus, the valence patterns in (718) are the most typical, and they are
therefore called ""standard valence patterns"" here. Each of them is exemplified in one subsection of 15.3.

V (TABS, L A D V)V (A E R G , TABS, L a d v )(15.3.14.)In addition, there are two groups of ""non-standard valence patterns"". In
the first group, there is a Dative argument with subject properties (15.4.1.),
and in the second group, the Absolutive argument has been incorporated
into the verb so that there is no Absolutive argument in the valence pattern
(""Absolutive absorption"", 15.4.2.1.).
The valence patterns of verbs that take clausal arguments (=complement
clauses) have not been taken into account here. For such complement-taking verbs, see Ch. 20.
The general principles to which Lezgian valence patterns conform
(especially (i)-(v) above) are not particularly exotic or exceptional. Aside
from Ergativity, there are only two features that set Lezgian off from the familiar European languages: Dative experiencers and consistent Absolutive27015. Verbal valencethemes. Thus, in an experiential verb like akun 'see' and other experiential
expressions (cf. 15.4.1.), the experiencer is expressed in the Dative case:
(719) Zamira.di-zDianaZamita-DATDianaaku-na.
see-AOR'Zamira saw Diana, (lit. Diana was visible to Zamira.)'
And themes are consistently in the Absolutive case, even where a patient
argument is also present and would be the direct object in the familiar
European languages. In Lezgian, this patient is expressed in one of the local
cases. For example, the patient arguments of the verbs 'stroke' and 'sweep'
appear in the Adelative and Superelative cases, respectively, in the following examples (an analogous example is (717) above).
(720) Emirmet.a
Emirmet(ERG)qhilqw.e-wajgilgiic'-na. (Q81:113)cheek-ADELhandstroke-AOR'Emirmet stroked her cheek with his hand.' (Lit. 'Emirmet stroked his
hand along her cheek.')
(721) Aminat.a
Aminat(ERG)k'wal.e-lajkkulelä-na. (Talibov 1958:241)room-SRELbroomsweep-AOR'Aminat swept the room with a broom.' (Lit. 'Aminat swept the
broom through the room.')
In the familiar European languages, the Lezgian local patients have to be
rendered as direct objects, and the Lezgian Absolutive themes correspond to
instrumental phrases. These instrumental phrases sound somewhat redundant in the translations of (720M721) because the verbal actions ('stroke',
'sweep') are such that they are exclusively or typically carried out with these
instruments. But this is not the case in Lezgian because quite generally verb
meaning is more general than in the familiar European languages. For example, gilc'un not only means 'stroke', but also 'wipe' (stoldiwaj pek giic'un
'wipe a table with a cloth') or 'rub', and elägun not only means 'sweep', but
also 'wave (with a cap)' and 'nod (one's head)'.
These characteristics of Lezgian valence patterns can be generalized and
we can say that Lezgian shows a tendency toward a closer correspondence
between semantic roles and case-marking: Agents are always in the Ergative
case, themes are always in the Absolutive, recipients and experiencers are
always in the Dative, patients are always in one of the local cases. This is in
marked contrast to the familiar European languages, where nominative
subjects can be agents, themes, experiencers, and sometimes even patients,
accusative direct objects can be themes, patients, or experiencers, etc. It is
true that there are exceptions in Lezgian as well; for instance, the Absolutive
argument of kiligun (CABS/ DDAT) ' C looks at D' would appear to be an agent
rather than a theme, and Lezgian also has metaphorical expressions like i
banka.di pud litr q'ada (Talibov & Gad2iev 1966:207) 'this can holds three
liters'. But it cannot be denied that there is a tendency toward a closer link
between semantic roles and case-marking, so that we can call Lezgian a
""role-dominated language"" (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984, A. E. Kibrik 1980b).","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"20.6. The converb strategy
This strategy is used in two cases: (1) in different-subject complements to
k'an- 'want, must'; (2) in situation complements to akun 'see'.
20.6.1. Different-subject complements to k'anAs we saw in 20.2.1., same-subject (and subject-controlled) complements to
k'an- are expressed by the Infinitive. But when the complement subject is
not coreferential with the Dative subject of k'an-, the complement is expressed by the Aorist converb. A minimal pair is shown in (1029a-b).
(1029) a. Nabisat.a-zktabNabisat-DAT[bookk'el-izk'an-zawa.read-INF]want-IMPF'Nabisat wants to read a book.'
b. Nabisat.a-zNabisat-DATruS.a[girl(ERC)ktab k'el-na

See 16.1.3. for more discussion of the two types of k'an- complements (and
cf. (190b) for an unusual Masdar complement of k'an-).
When k'an- is used without a subject ('one wants'), it means 'must'.
Since the complement subject is necessarily different from the (non-existing) subject of k'an-, the complement predicate is always in the Aorist converb form. In this meaning, k'an- is generally in the Future tense (k'anda,
cf. 9.5.2.1.).

All the three general converbs (Aorist converb, Imperfective converb and
Secondary Imperfective converb of the Perfect) are used in complement
clauses with situation meaning to akun 'see'. See 20.4. for fact complements
of akun.

Complement clauses can be extraposed to a clause-final position. In such
cases the particle Ai follows the complement-taking predicate, and an intonation break (indicated by a comma) separates the main clause from the extraposed complement clause that follows it. This strategy was borrowed ultimately from Persian (probably via Turkic), where ke is a clause-initial subordinator. However, in Lezgian xi is clearly a clause-final particle (as it is in
some
(1034) Turkic
Selim.a languages).

Seher.di-z
fe-na.
Selim(ERG)say-AORΡΓNabisattown-DATgo-AOR'Selim said that Nabisat had gone to town.'
The status of the extraposed complement clause seems to be ambiguous between subordinate clause status and independent clause status. Evidence for
this ambiguity comes from reflexive pronouns, which have to be used in
subordinate clauses when coreference with a reflexive controller in the superordinate clause is intended (see 22.4.). In extraposed clauses either the reflexive or the anaphoric pronouns may be used:20.7. The xi strategy 371

The extraposition strategy can be used, roughly, whenever English that is
used, i.e. in complements to (1) cognitive complement-taking predicates; (2)
verbs of thinking; (3) verbs of saying; (4) evaluative predicates.
