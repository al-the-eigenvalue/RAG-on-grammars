Note that those negative verbs which have a positive counterpart can be replaced in
discourse by the negation of that positive counterpart with nomo. The pairs in (206)
and (207), and (208) and (209) for nopa’e ‘cannot’ and tule ‘not want’, respectively,
illustrate this. There appears to be no notable difference in meaning between these
two variant ways of expression.

the combination of so’ot ‘want’ with the negation. Nomo ma’en ‘not know’, on the
other hand, is more common than the corresponding negative verb isipo’. Nopa’e
‘cannot’ and me’e / hul ‘be able’, finally, are used in approximately the same
proportions.
The negative verbs and their positive counterparts, where present, are
morphologically totally unrelated.","[194, 195]"

in (71) and (72); in the former, the verb (k)-asu ‘for’ expresses causation, while in
the latter, the Indonesian loan gara-gara ‘because (negative affectedness)’ is used.

(49) and (50), this is not necessarily the case, as (51), with what looks like an
affirmative, demonstrates. Note that =oo is used twice here; the first occurrence
marks the clausal object to ma’en ‘know’, whereas the second, cliticised on NP level
to the first person plural exclusive pronoun ini, corresponds to English ‘too’ (see
§ 3.5.2.1, p. 245).

"3.2.3.7 Negative verbs
Makalero possesses a group of verbs which are inherently negative in meaning. The
negative verbs found in Makalero are listed in Table 3.21, which also gives the
corresponding positive verbs, where possible.
The juxtaposition of the negative verbs with their positive counterparts shows, first
and foremost, that several negative verbs lack a good positive counterpart. For both
lesa ‘not have’ and na’an ‘not exist’, for example, the deictic verb ue’ ‘be there’ has
been given as a counterpart in brackets. This verb primarily predicates location
(§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180), but it is by extension also used to predicate existence. The
positive counterpart to lu’a ‘not get’ is a complement-verb complex rather than a
single verb; ti’a-mei translates literally as ‘towards-take’. There is no verb
specifically expressing the notion of permission; rau ‘good’ is used for this purpose
(see § 3.2.3.10, p.186, for details on the construction). Finally, there is no verbal
expression for something like ‘already’ to complement oko-na ‘not yet’. The aspect
marker hai (§ 3.4.3, p. 242) is generally used to convey this notion.",[194]
"3.4 Grammatical morphemes within the VP
There are fewer grammatical morphemes associated with the VP than with the NP.
§ 3.4.1 (p. 241) discusses the argument-marking k-prefix, § 3.4.2 (p. 242) the
negative prefix ni-, § 3.4.3 (p. 242) the aspect marker hai and, finally, § 3.4.4
(p. 242) the negation nomo.",[266]

ho’o in subject position translates as ‘nobody’, and (396), where ho’o heads the
subject NP and is not read as a negative indefinite. This again contrasts with (398),
in which ho’o is the head of the non-subject NP (and thus within the verb phrase),
and translates as the negative polarity item ‘anybody’. It seems, thus, that ho’o, if
used within the subject argument to a negated clause, can have several readings.
Ho’o frequently occurs twice within a clause, contrasting two sets of a larger group.
(400), for instance, gives information on two contrasting subgroups among the civil
war fugitives on Mount Matebian.

(17-04)
Often ho’o follows a topical NP in the left-detached position (§ 7.6.1, p. 427), which
overtly expresses the set to a part of which ho’o makes reference, as in (401).

"7.7.2.1 Polar questions
Polar questions do not involve a question word. They consist of a full sentence and
expect an answer in terms of yes and no. Polar questions in Makalero need not be
marked morphologically as such. In such cases, it is only the rising-falling
intonation contour that marks them as interrogatives. An example is given in (117),
with the corresponding pitch contour shown in Figure 7.4. Note that the overall pitch
contour gently rises, reaching a peak on the final syllable; following this pitch peak,
there is a distinctive drop on that same syllable.
(117)… ei so’ot=ini uerileuk?2s want=LNK1 bottom drill‘… do you want to have (your) bottom drilled?’(118-38)THE SENTENCE439Pitch (Hz)5000

Na’an, the negative existential, and oko-na ‘not yet’ are frequently used as one-word
answers to yes/no-questions. There is, however, no good positive one-word answer.
The Portuguese loan sim ‘yes’ is found in that function very occasionally. Also,
speakers accepted the verb tafi ‘true’ as a one-word answer upon questioning,
though such a structure was not produced in natural speech. In general, the most
common reply to a polar question is the repetition of a part of or the whole sentence.
Two examples are shown in (118) and (119).
(118)Ei tafi isit? – Ani tafi isit.
2strue ill1strue ill‘Are you really ill? - Yes.’
(119)(elic871)Kiloo hai nami-ena? – Tone’ hai nami-ena.
3sNSIT husband-seeperhaps NSIT husband-see‘Is she married already? – Maybe.’(elic1152-1152a)In the case of verbs with complement clause extensions, such as so’ot ‘want’ in
(117) above, it is these superordinate verbs that are repeated as one-word answers
two polar questions. That is, a positive answer to a question as (117) is so’ot ‘(I)
want’.
Polar questions can be overtly marked as such by the markers =ua and =uai (na’an),
both of which are cliticised to the right end of the question. Note that =ua is
homophonous with the relative marker (§ 3.3.5.1, p. 240). While a historical
relationship between the two is unproven, it is a fact that relative makers very
commonly derive from interrogative words cross-linguistically. (120) and (121) give440CHAPTER 7examples of the use of =ua as a question marker (see § 7.7.1, p. 435, above for the
use of the same particle with declaratives).

"107Oko ‘yet’ is a verb-phrase-internal adverbial (§ 3.2.3.3.1, p. 159). It is most frequently combined with
the internal negation nomo as oko nomo, which translates as ‘not yet’. Na appears to be a negative verb
which is never found except in combination with oko; the whole is thus regarded as a lexicalised unit and
is, as such, hyphenated.",[195]
"3:UND-for placesometakegive.to.3‘… give him a place…’(69-055)Ho’o ‘some’ does not cooccur with other determiners such as the demonstratives
discussed in § 3.3.2.1 (p. 232) above, which suggests that they stand in the same slot
and are, hence, members of one category. A given NP can thus have one determiner
at most.
Ho’o is particularly frequent with generic nouns such as amuni ‘person’, amulafu
‘living person’ and sa’a ‘thing’; the combination amounts to an indefinite pronoun
(see also fn 136). Examples are given in (394) and (395).

1pi-for thing some cook=LNK1‘… cook something for us, and then…’(23-005)As in the case of demonstratives, ho’o ‘some’, too, can constitute an NP of its own.
This usage is quite equivalent to that of ho’o with a generic noun, i.e. is read as an
indefinite pronoun. Notably, ho’o can, in these cases, stand for both human and nonhuman (inanimate) referents, as shown in (396) and (397), respectively.

"LEXICAL CATEGORIES171Unlike other verbs, negative verbs are not compatible with the internal negator
nomo (§ 3.4.4, p. 242). However, the clause they appear in can as a whole be
negated with the clausal negator nomohaka (§ 3.6.1, p. 264), as (210) shows.

associated with an undergoer. Lesa ‘not have’, lu’a ‘not get’ and tule ‘not want’, on
the other hand, are clearly transitive and include an undergoer participant in their
semantic participant frame. The cases of nopa’e ‘cannot’ and oko-na ‘not yet’ and
irau ‘not allowed’ are somewhat unclear with respect to transitivity. Used as full
verbs, they do not cooccur with non-subject arguments, indicating that they are
intransitive. On the other hand, constructions where they are used as complement
verbs suggest that they may take an argument expressing an undergoer; the evidence
in question is provided in § 3.2.3.10.2.1 (p. 193). Finally, isipo’ ‘not know’ is in all
cases used as a clause on its own, without any participants expressed. An example is
(211). It is therefore impossible to determine its transitivity.

Oko-na ‘not yet’, nopa’e ‘cannot’ irau ‘not allowed’ and tule ‘not want’ are further
distinguished from the other transitive negative verbs in that they can take
subordinated complement clause extensions (see § 3.2.3.10.2, p. 193, for details on
that construction type).","[195, 196]"

A special construction, found several times in the corpus, is one where =oo is
cliticised to a sequence of two clauses, the first of which is positive and immediately
followed by the same VP in the negative. This construction is to be translated as “no

Table 3.42 shows that for most items, a variety of lexemes are available to express
the same meaning.
Among the quantifiers which denote the whole of a group, the most important one is
hau. It is a floating quantifier that can stand both within the VP, if modifying the
verb or the VP-internal argument, or as a predication of its own if modifying the
subject. § 5.3.3.3.1 (p. 376) discusses these constructions in more detail. Note also
that hau appears to be developing into a marker of completive aspect, as shown in
§ 5.3.3.2 (p. 369).
Haka ‘all’ is most often found together with hau in a complement verb complex of
the form haka-hau. There are a few cases, however, where haka occurs on its own as
a quantifier. Other items which stand in the same position as haka are kafu-, felu and
kopa. Like haka, felu and kafu-119 occur as quantifiers on their own, without hau.
The same is not the case, however, for kopa, which is only found in the phrase kopahau. Consequently, it is not listed in Table 3.42 as an independent quantifier. The
constructions in question are discussed in more detail § 5.3.3.3.1 (p. 376).
Ata’u appears to mean something like ‘all together, all at once’. It is much less
frequent than hau, but can also be used within or without the VP as a floating
quantifier. It is discussed in more detail in § 5.3.3.3.2 (p. 380).
Fanu’ ‘all’, finally, is very rare, being found in only one instance in the corpus. This
sentence does not make its category clear; however, the /ʔ/-ending strongly suggests
it is verbal in category (§ 3.2.2.1.1, p. 128).
Among the quantifiers denoting the majority of a group, rial and roual ‘many’ are
counterparts, the first of which is used with human referents, while the second is
reserved for non-human referents. Both are used as full predicates only.
The quantifiers paun and ropa’ ‘many’ are associated with non-human subjects and
are rarely used in affirmative clauses. However, ropa’ appears in the interrogatives
tauropa’ and teteropa’ (both ‘how many’), where it is the only way to ask for a
quantity and is used with all kinds of subjects (§ 3.2.3.6, p. 167).
There are no dedicated verbal quantifiers for the concept of ‘some’. Teteropa’ and
tauropa’, which are found in this function, are actually interrogatives (§ 3.2.3.6,
p. 167). Teteropa’ is, as a quantifier, sometimes combined with the numeral u ‘one’.
118There may also be an item tana’u; it is not quite clear, however, if this really is a quantifier and also if
it really is unanalysable.

Kafu- is the reduced form of the quantifier kafu’ ‘all’, which, used on its own as a full verb, is
restricted to subjects referring to periods of time.","[240, 241]"

clause predicate can be found in the LDP, but also NPs which are neither. In (99),
the negative existential na’an is intransitive, thus not associated with an undergoer;
its subject is the coordinated NP ki-nua ki-ke’ ‘food and drink’. The first person
exclusive pronoun ini thus has no grammatical role in the clause, but can be said to
set the frame of validity for the following clause. Similarly, in (100), the deictic verb
ue’ is intransitive, its subject argument being afa=hi’a ‘only bones’. The NP asiafur=ee ‘my body’ has no grammatical role in this clause, but sets the frame for the
following clause, determining its range of applicability. In both cases, the nonargument NP in the left-detached position is bracketed.

"3.2.3 Types of verbs
The open category of verbs can be classified into a variety of groups, based on
morphological and syntactic grounds. The morphologically-based verb classes are
those discussed in § 3.2.2 (p. 127), and the following sections deal with classes
mainly based on syntactic grounds, such that they are reflected in one way or
another in grammar. A classification of subgroups on purely semantic grounds is
avoided as far as possible. Classifications that encompass all verbs are those of
valency, discussed in § 3.2.3.1 (p. 141), and event typology in § 3.2.3.2 (p. 150).
The sections following these define subclasses of verbs, namely adverbial verbs in
§ 3.2.3.3 (p. 159), verbs with the third-person object marking prefix in § 3.2.3.4
(p. 163), weather and times of day verbs with fixed subjects in § 3.2.3.5 (p. 164),
interrogative verbs in § 3.2.3.6 (p. 167), negative verbs in § 3.2.3.7 (p. 169),
numerals in § 3.2.3.8 (p. 171), deictic verbs in § 3.2.3.9 (p. 180), verbs with
complement clause extensions in § 3.2.3.10 (p. 186), verbs of physical or emotional
states in § 3.2.3.11 (p. 197), and verbs with grammatical rather than lexical meaningLEXICAL CATEGORIES141in § 3.2.3.12 (p. 202). § 3.2.3.13 (p. 210) and § 3.2.3.14 (p. 215) remark on
movement verbs and quantifying verbs, respectively, even though these do not
behave as a consistent group. Being defined on semantic grounds, these last sections
present exceptions to the principle of syntactically relevant classes.","[165, 166]"

"DISCOURSE STRUCTURE4959.2 Information structure
The terminology used in the present short discussion of information structure
follows Lambrecht (1996) in most respects. In that work, information structure is
defined as “that component of sentence grammar in which propositions as
conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical
structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret
these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts” (ibid: 5). A
referent is interpreted as the topic of a proposition “if in a given situation the
proposition is construed as being about this referent, i.e. as expressing information
which is relevant to and which increases the addressee’s knowledge of this referent”
(Lambrecht 1996: 131). Focus, on the other hand, is defined as “[t]he semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs
from the presupposition” (Lambrecht 1996: 213). In discourse, the correlation
between subject and topic is generally very strong. In a typical clause, the predicate
asserts new information about this topic; it is thus the focus. This neatly describes
the unmarked case, in which the subject is the topic and the object part of the focus,
in Makalero. However, other constellations of topic and focus structure and the
grammatical expression of a sentence are possible. These are discussed below in so
far as they find grammatical expression in discourse. § 9.2.1 (p. 495) gives some
observations on non-canonical word orders, § 9.2.2 (p. 500) treats a specific focus
construction, and § 9.2.3 (p. 500) discusses some particles related to the structuring
of information.","[519, 520]"

functions as a general deictic to refer to remote locations where a person-bound
reference frame is not applicable. (238) above, which refers to events taking place in
Dili, may be an example of this. Furthermore, ue’ also predicates existence, as in
(241) and (242) (see also § 3.2.3.7, p. 169) which gives ue’ as the positive
counterpart of the negative existential na’an).

V2DEM‘It also happens that families who did not visit each other start visiting each

(21-057)
A very similar construction, with the sole difference of the subject being modified
by a possessor, reads as predicating possession (see also § 3.2.3.12.5, p. 207, for
another way to predicate possession).",[207]
"2.2.3.1 Sequences of two identical vowels
In several instances, what is realised as a long vowel corresponds in fact to a
sequence of two identical short vowels interrupted in careful pronunciation by an
allophone of the glottal phoneme /ʔ/.40 (21) shows two examples.
(21)[lɔ:n] / ['lɔʔɔn]
[ti:] / ['tiʔi]lo’on
ti’‘sky’
‘pour (a drink)’Hence some long vowels are actually made up of a sequence of two identical short
vowels. This is also the case with the negative existential na’an, the most common
realisation of which has been given in § 2.2.3 (p. 62) as forming a minimal pair with
nana ‘elder sibling’. This process is regularly found with verbs derived from nouns
by means of the glottal verbaliser (see § 3.2.2.1.1, p. 128). For instance, the variant
forms [la'fu:hu] ~ [la'fu:ʔu] of lafu’ ‘live’, derived from lafu ['lafu] ‘life’, are often
realised in running speech as [la'fu:].",[89]
"3.4.4 The negator nomo
The negator nomo stands within the VP between two adverbial slots (§ 5, p. 317). It
is not phonetically dependent on either a preceding or a following item; as such it is
treated as a free particle. It expresses internal negation, as opposed to external141Note, however, that undergoers of the first and second persons are in the same context expressed with
the independent pronoun forms, rather than with the possessive form. The parallel between personal
pronouns and other pronouns thus does not go all the way. In fact, this highlights once more the
difference in status between the pronouns referring to the speech act participants on the one hand, and the
third person pronoun on the other.",[267]

show the relationship between them – i.e. that they are mutually exclusive and can

representing either type of VP-internal argument, rather than to combine them into
one scheme.

strict syntactic constraints on the expression of participants. Consequently,
somewhat more complex states of affairs, such as those involving a predicative
adverbial expression or those with more than two participants, must be expressed in
two clauses, while they constitute, both semantically as well as phonologically, a
single event or utterance. Such sentences are discussed in § 7.1 (p. 402). The
biclausal expression of a ditransitive state of affairs qualifies as one argument
structure construction in Goldberg’s (1995) terminology.
In natural speech, a minority of clauses fill all the positions provided by the clause
templates in (3) and (4). In fact, the nucleus of the clause, or its predicate, is the only
obligatory element. Both verbal arguments as well as any kinds of periphery
elements are readily omittable, given an appropriate context. As such, a single verb
can make up a complete clause. Examples are shown in (5) and (6), which show the
negative existential na’an and the modal verb so’ot ‘want, like’, respectively, used
as minimal answers to polar questions. Both are full verbs, which can take a subject
argument and aspect marking, as shown for na’an in (7), and a subject argument, an
aspect marker, and a complement argument, as shown for so’ot in (8).

"6.6 The operators
Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 40) define a class of operators to account for elements
representing “grammatical categories which are qualitatively different from
predicates and their arguments (…) they modify the clause and its parts.” Aspect,
negation, directionals, modality, status (including such things as epistemic modality,
external negation and realis and irrealis), tense, evidentials, and illocutionary force
make up their class of operators. Not all of these categories are relevant for
Makalero; the representation in (39), adapted from Van Valin and LaPolla
(1997: 47), shows only those that are more or less grammaticalised in the language394CHAPTER 6as well as the level of clause structure they universally apply to, according to the
authors.
(39)V
NUCLEUSaspectCOREmodalityCOREnegation (internal)CLAUSEstatusCLAUSEillocutionary forceSENTENCE
According to Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 46), the “basic principle of scope
assignment governing operators is clausal > core > nuclear, where ‘>’ means ‘has
scope over’.”
Among Van Valin and LaPolla’s operators listed above but not shown in (39) are
directionals, tense and evidentiality. These are not grammaticalised categories in
Makalero and are consequently not discussed here (some remarks on directionality
can be found in § 5.2.2.5.6 (p. 345); on the anchoring of a state of affairs in time in
§ 7.2.1 (p. 414); and on the expression of indirect information in § 8.1.9 (p. 476). Of
the operators that are listed in (39), only aspect, negation and status are relevant at
clause level or lower in Makalero; they are treated in § 6.6.1 (p. 394), § 6.6.2
(p. 396), and § 6.6.3 (p. 398), respectively. As their discussion in the following
sections makes apparent, Makalero operators do not conform to Van Valin and
LaPolla’s proposed hierarchy as reproduced partially in (39) and the associated
scope readings. Furthermore, modality and illocutionary force operate on levels
other than the clause in Makalero. Illocutionary force works on the sentence level
and is discussed there (§ 7.7, p. 435), while the expression of modality may take
either the form of a complement VP or of a separate predication or clause and is thus
hard to place in a schema as (39). It is treated in detail in § 7.2.4 (p. 420) and § 7.3
(p. 421; see also § 3.2.3.10.2, p. 193).","[418, 419]"
"6.6.2 Negation
According to Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 47), internal negation is a core operator,
and as such has scope over the aspect operator, which works on the nucleus level. In
Makalero, however, the situation is quite the opposite. The only real aspect marker,
hai, is outside of the negation’s scope. On the contrary, it is the negator nomo which
is within the scope of the new situation marker, as (49) shows; in this clause, hai
marks the beginning of the negated state. The corresponding positive sentence is
given in (50) for comparison.

"1.6.3 Lexical categories
All content words in Makalero are analysed as either nouns or verbs. Basically any
lexeme can be used for referencing and for predicating, hence the classification of
morphemes into these two classes is not straightforward. Nevertheless, I argue for
the reality of a noun/verb distinction in Makalero based on the fact that there are
some – largely unproductive – category-changing derivational processes, as well as
a number of lexemes which receive widely differing, unrelated meanings if used
either as prototypical verbs or nouns. § 3.1.1 (p. 100) and § 3.2.1 (p. 125) suggest a
semantic feature as a general identification criterion for nouns and verbs:
prototypical nouns, if used predicatively, are generally translated as “is an x”.
Prototypical verbs in referring function, on the other hand, may denote “the act of xing”, “the product of x-ing” or “an instrument or object associated with x-ing”.
Makalero is largely isolating. The most productive morphological process is
reduplication. In some cases, it appears to derive nouns from verbs. Otherwise, with
both nouns and activity verbs, reduplication has a distributivity reading, denoting a
variety of referents. With stative verbs, it is generally read as denoting a high degree
of the property expressed by the verb. Other than that, an unproductive formative -rcan be identified, which appears to be broadly nominalising in function. The suffix
-ini is another way of deriving nouns from verbs. Also, there is an agent noun suffix
-door, borrowed ultimately from Portuguese. Some more morphological variation is
found in the domain of verbs. There is an unproductive verbaliser in the form of the
glottal phoneme as well as some inflectional morphology. A subclass of
semantically intransitive verbs inflect for subject number. A more sizeable group of
verbs exhibits bound forms used in a complement-verb complex.
In the domain of nouns, there is evidence for the distinction of nouns with the
feature [+HUM] as opposed to those with the feature [-HUM]. The former can be
marked with a plural suffix, while the latter are not commonly found with this
suffix. Among [+HUM] nouns, there is a subgroup of kinship terms, which take a
special plural marker distinct from the one found with other human nouns. Another
way of classifying nouns is whether or not they take nominal classifiers. There is
furthermore a group of nouns which is obligatorily used in a possessive
construction; these include kinship terms and nouns that can be characterised as
parts of a whole. Despite the absence of special marking, these nouns can be
classified as inalienably possessed.
In the verbal domain, there is a major distinction between stative verbs and activity
verbs. Most notably, the VP-internal adverb hau ‘all’ is read as a marker of
completion with activity verbs, but denotes high degree with stative verbs. With
respect to syntactic valency, the majority of verbs is divalent. While the first of the22CHAPTER 1two arguments associated with these verbs is a subject, the second can take the form
of either an object or a complement. The two instantiations of the second argument
differ in position. Nominal undergoers are commonly associated with the object
position, while locations and goals are usually found in the complement position.
Pronominal undergoers can stand in either position. A small minority of verbs is
analysed as being avalent, i.e. have a valency of zero and do not take any argument.
These generally express temporal or modal concepts such as soohe’ ‘yesterday’,
tone’ ‘perhaps’, or atanana ‘first’. Other verbal subgroups are constituted by
negative verbs, interrogative verbs, numerals, deictic verbs, quantifiers, verbs of
physical and emotional states and verbs with complement clause extensions.
Furthermore, there is a sizeable group of verbs which are marked with the third
person undergoer prefix k- in the circumstances discussed in § 5.2.2.6.3 (p. 349). It
is argued that these verb forms are undergoing a reanalysis into free and bound verb
forms.
Closed lexical categories include free personal pronouns and their adnominal forms,
i.e. possessive pronouns; reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, the former also with an
adnominal form; two interrogative pronouns, mu’a- ‘who (BD)’ and sa’a- ‘what
(BD)’, as well as their adnominal forms; and an indefinite pronoun, riparipa ‘any’.
A class of determiners is made up of a series of demonstratives as well as ho’o
‘some’. They stand in the rightmost slot within the NP.
There is also a variety of bound morphemes. Apart from the derivational morphemes
mentioned above, these include plural suffixes, a honorific suffix, an agent noun
suffix, a nominaliser suffix, an enclitic relative marker and a proclitic attributive
marker. All of the latter are associated with the noun phrase. Within the verb phrase,
there is the above-mentioned third-person object prefix k- which is found with a
subgroup of verbs, the aspect marker hai and the negative marker nomo. Finally,
there is a variety of phrase-level clitics. The majority of these are clause linkers,
cliticised to the first clause in a sequence, that specify the semantic relation of that
clause to the one that follows it.","[46, 47]"
"THE CLAUSE(40)395VP
(OBJ)(ASP)(ADV)* (NEG)(41)(ADV)* HEADVP
(ASP)(ADV)* (NEG)(ADV)* (COMPL)-HEADHai has scope over all modifiers to the right of it, including negation. According to
Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 46), the aspect operator is nuclear and should
therefore be under the scope of the core operator negation (see (39) above).
However, the very opposite is the case in Makalero: as (42) shows, hai marks the
beginning of the negated situation (i.e. the beginning of the absence of stomach
pain).
(42)… asi-atupusi hai nomo isit.
1s:POSS-belly NSIT NEGill‘... my belly did not hurt anymore.’(101-137)It is not possible to negate a new situation with hai using the internal negator nomo.
For this purpose, the clause negator nomohaka (see § 6.6.3, p. 398) must be used.
Makalero speakers will, however, make sense of the clause given in (43) as in (44),
by interpreting hai not as an aspect marker, but as the reduced form of the speakerrelated deictic verb in a complement-verb complex. In this process, the initial /h/ of
the aspect marker, which is often very faint indeed, is dropped completely.

Hai also has scope over verb-phrase internal adverbials, which are equalled in § 6.5
(p. 393) above to the clause periphery. An example is shown in (45). If a speaker
wishes to specifically exclude the adverb from the scope of hai, he must use it as a
separate clause, as (46) shows.

3shaitia.true=LNK1 NSIT sleep‘It is true that he already sleeps.’(chat066)The VP complement in a complement-verb complex can take its own aspect
marking. Examples are given in (47), where hai is outside the verbal complex and
modifies the VP as a whole, and in (48), where it stands within the VP complement
and has scope only over the dependent verb. The extent of the VPs in question is
signalled by square brackets. Note, however, that there appears to be no marked
difference in reading between the two constructions.

negator, directly contradicting Van Valin and LaPolla’s (1997: 46) prediction, but
also over the periphery adverbs.
Another item that functions very much like an aspect marker is hau ‘all’, which
differs in many respects from the aspect marker hai; for instance, it may or may not
be placed under the scope of the negation. § 5.3.3.2 (p. 369) argues that it is a VPinternal adverbial that is grammaticalising into an aspect marker. Hence it is part of
the periphery rather than an operator and is not further discussed here.","[419, 420, 421]"

Grammar has encountered a number of problems. A large part of these operators do
not work on clause level in Makalero, but on a higher level of organisation, the
sentence; consequently, they have been excluded from the present section, which
deals with phenomena on the clause level only. First and foremost among such
higher-level phenomena is modality, which can be expressed either as a separate
clause or as a complement (§ 7.3, p. 421), but also the epistemic modality part of the
status operator, which is always expressed as a separate clause. Another one,
illocutionary force, also operates on sentence level (§ 7.7, p. 435). This left only
aspect, (internal) negation, and the external negation part of the status operator to be
treated in the present chapter. In Van Valin and LaPolla’s analysis, these would be a
nuclear operator, a core operator, and a clause operator, respectively. My analysis of
the level of operation of these operators agrees with Van Valin and LaPolla’s only in
the case of the clausal negator nomohaka, while the ordering of aspect and negation
is inverted.","[424, 425]"
"24CHAPTER 11.6.6 The clause
The unmarked word order in the clause is SOV. The subject argument generally has
little repercussion on the rest of the clause. With a number of verbs which inflect for
subject number, the number of the subject (whether overtly marked or not)
determines the form of the verb. Apart from this, the use of the reflexive pronoun ni
marks coreferentiality with the subject. Furthermore, the NP clitic =ini, analysed in
§ 9.2.3.1 (p. 501) as a contrastive marker, appears to be developing into a subject
marker, which is used whenever a speaker considers word order alone not to be
enough to clarify the subject referent. This may be the case in sentences with noncanonical word order, or if the subject argument is considerably lower on the topicworthiness hierarchy than the second argument.
As mentioned in § 5.2 (p. 319), the non-subject argument can syntactically be
realised in two ways, namely either as an object or as a complement. Either of these
is a possible filler of the verb’s syntactic argument position. Any additional
arguments need to be expressed in a separate clause. Such multi-clause units are
termed ‘sentences’ and discussed in § 7 (p. 401).
Operators (as defined by Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 40) that work on clause-level
in Makalero are aspect, negation and status.","[48, 49]"
"NSIT many.HUM‘The population of Timor is not already large. / It is not the case that the
population of Timor is already large.’
(pelic405)
However, there is one instance where, contrary to this rule, hai nomo is used in just
such a context, disregarding the actually rather marked scope reading of this
combination; (52) gives the sentence in question. Note that hai nomo ma’u is
translated as ‘he did not come’, rather than as the predicted ‘he did already not
come.’
(52)… ini ue’=inihein hein hein=ini hai nomo ma’u.1pe V2DEM=LNK1 waitwaitwait=LNK1 NSIT NEGcome‘... we were there and kept waiting (for him), but he did not come.’
(67-18)
The negator nomo can be placed before or after VP-internal adverbials and thus has
variable scope either including or excluding the periphery verbs. Examples are
shown in (53) and (54).

several of them to stand on one side of the negator, (55) and (56) show that other
permutations are also possible.

Status, according to Van Valin and LaPolla (1997: 41), includes epistemic modality,
external negation and categories like realis and irrealis. Epistemic modality is first
and foremost expressed in Makalero by the adverbial predicate tone’ ‘maybe,
possibly, perhaps’. As a predicate of its own, it is not discussed here, but in § 7.2.4
(p. 420). Realis and irrealis seem to be of no consequence in Makalero grammar. As
such, the only representative of status in Makalero is external negation. This concept
is expressed by nomohaka. It is possible that the element -haka is connected to
=haka, a clitic marker expressing the contradiction of a presupposition (§ 3.5.1.2,
p. 244). Indeed, clausal negation (translatable as ‘it is not the case that…’) appears
to involve the contradiction of an expectation or presupposition in all cases. The
categorial status of this negator is discussed in § 3.6.1 (p. 264).
Nomohaka is found both clause-initially, as in (57), or following the subject
argument, as in (58). It thus behaves much like the avalent adverbial predicates
(§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141). As argued in § 7.6.1 (p. 427) for similar constructions with that
type of predicates, the subject of (58) can be analysed as standing in the leftdetached position.

associated with nouns and verbs, respectively. A particularly clear example is the
deictic paradigm (§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180 and § 3.3.2.1, p. 232), which includes nominal
and verbal forms. However, most of these processes are of limited productivity, and
there is a large number of content words which are never used with any derivation.
A working definition of the main lexical categories based on other than
morphological criteria, which can capture these, is thus needed in order to make
generalisations over lexemes belonging to these classes possible.
Haspelmath (2001: 16543) points out that, despite the above-mentioned problems, it
is generally possible to categorise word forms into nouns and verbs in individual
languages. As an example, he gives the word fōma’i ‘doctor’ in Samoan (ibid.),
which can be translated both as ‘doctor’ and ‘being a doctor’. This contrasts with
alu, which translates as ‘go’ and the ‘fact of going’, rather than ‘person who goes’
(ibid.). The former would be categorised as a noun, while the latter is a verb. Such
semantic correspondences can be used in the determination of word classes,
alongside morphological processes, if present, as well as syntactic characteristics.
In the following, I will use a combination of such semantic features as used by
Haspelmath (2001) as well as specific morphological alternations and derivations for
the purpose of distinguishing lexical categories in Makalero. Content words are
classified as belonging to one of the open lexical classes of nouns or verbs. § 3.1
(p. 99) discusses nouns, giving a tentative definition and distinguishing a number of
subgroups based on phonological, morphological and syntactic criteria. § 3.2
(p. 125) proceeds analogously with verbs. Most function words are particles or
affixes that are associated with either the noun phrase or the verb phrase, or clitics
attached on phrase-level. These closed-category items contrast with the open
categories noun and verb in that they do not participate in the functional flexibility
exhibited by those classes. § 3.3 (p. 217) treats closed categories associated with the
noun phrase, while those discussed in § 3.4 (p. 241) are associated with the verb
phrase. § 3.5 (p. 243) introduces a variety of phrase-level clitic. Finally, § 3.6
(p. 264) elaborates on some unclear cases.","[123, 124]"

modifiers within or without the complement VP does not appear to be associated
with the expected scope readings. Rather, they seem to be mere positional variants,
which, according to speaker judgements, mean the same thing. The pair of sentences
in (71) and (72) gives such an example. Note that a translation as the asterisked one
given in (72), which attempts to capture the expected complement-internal scope of
the negation, was specifically refused.

3SchurchNEGinside:RED-sit.SG‘He is not sitting in the church.’
(*He is sitting, (but) not in the church)(elic1326a)This may, perhaps, be compared to Neg-raising in English (see e.g. Croft 2001:
213), where a negation which semantically belongs to a subordinated clause is raised
to the main clause. The process involved here, however, appears to be the reverse,
i.e. lowering of VP modifiers into a subordinate structure rather than raising.
A VP complement is rarely obligatory171 or the only way of expression. In fact, VPcomplement-verb complexes can quite freely be broken up into two separate clauses.
The pairs in (73) and (74) as well as (75) and (76) illustrate this. (73) shows a
complement-verb complex with the verb (ko-)horu ‘with’; note that the main verb,
hifa’ ‘catch’, appears in the bound form -sifa’. This clearly signals that its
complement position is filled. In (74), on the other hand, tia ‘sleep’, which stands in
the same context as hifa’ ‘catch’ in (73), appears in the free form, rather than in the
bound form -dia. Hence, in this instance, the (ko-)horu-predication is a separate
clause, independent from the following verb. Similarly, in (75), ume-sein ‘wait over
there’ is a complex as shown by the use of the reduced form of the distal deictic verb
ume’ and the bound form of the verb hein ‘wait’. In (76), on the other hand, the
deictic verb forms a separate clause on a par with the hein-clause, as illustrated by
the fact that both verbs stand in their free forms and the appearance of the clause
linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.2, p. 249) between them. The semantic difference associated
with these variant constructions is subtle at best. It appears that the biclausal
constructions, as in (74) and (76), can be read as two separate, sequential actions,
whereas complement-verb complexes as in (73) and (75) refer to one event. In most
instances, the two constructions are used in equivalent ways. 172171Except with the verbal subgroups discussed in § 3.2.3.1.2.1 (p. 145) and § 3.2.3.1.2.2 (p. 146).
Where there is no conclusive evidence that two VPs form a complement-verb complex, such as in
cases where neither of the verbs involved have a bound form, these VPs are treated as two separate,
independent clauses.

standing in the left-detached position of the sentence (§ 7.6.1, p. 427). This NP is not
connected to the adverbial in any way and its position preceding the adverbial is not
evidence against the classification of the latter as avalent.
Aspect marking and adverbial modification, as shown in (110) and (111), are
characteristics of predicates, while external negation and the use of clause linkers, as
demonstrated in (112) through (114), are processes applying to clauses. Thus it is
obvious that such adverbial expressions are clausal units. There is no evidence
whatsoever to suggest that they are nominal. Hence adverbial expressions as listed
in (108) are treated here as a subclass of verbs which are distinct from other verbs by
being avalent.
According to their semantics, which express adverbial notions, avalent adverbial
predicates are not used as utterances of their own, but only in multi-clausal units

"3. Lexical categories
According to most basic textbooks, a distinction between at least two lexical
categories, namely nouns and verbs, is a universal trait in languages (e.g. Payne
1997: 32). That is, they posit a basic distinction between the expression of objects
and actions, or reference and predication. There is, however, no consensus over this
seemingly basic fact: specific theories may define other sets of basic word classes.
For instance, Croft (2001: 63) argues for three universal basic word classes, namely
nouns, verbs and adjectives, with the chief functions of denoting objects, actions and
properties, respectively. Yet another approach argues that word class distinctions
must be considered a matter of degree (see e.g. Sasse 1993).
Evidence challenging traditional word class theory has, among others, been adduced
from Austronesian languages. Specifically, many individual Austronesian languages
have been analysed as lacking a noun/verb distinction. This may be illustrated by
such examples as (1) and (2) from Tongan (Broschart 1997: 134, examples (15) and
(16)).
(1)na’e lele e
PAST runkaufefinéSPEC PL:HUM woman.DEF‘The women were running.’
(2)na’e fefine kotoa e
PAST woman allkauleléSPEC PL:HUM run.DEF‘The ones running were all female.’
These sentences show how the word form fefine ‘woman’ can appear as both an
argument and a predicate, without any overt derivation. The same holds for lele
‘run’, which can be used both as a predicate as well as as an argument. These word
forms appear to be unspecified for lexical category, and it is only their function
within a given clause (i.e. whether they are used in the nominal slot, on the right
edge of the clause in the above examples, or in the verbal slot clause-initially) that
determines their translational equivalents as either arguments or predicates. In fact,
Broschart (1997: 128) arrives at the conclusion that Tongan is a language which
completely lacks a noun/verb distinction. Such characteristics are not restricted to
Tongan, but are fairly widespread in Austronesian languages. These languages are
approximations of Gilʼs (2000: 194, 202) language type with only one single but
open syntactic category. In this language type, “all words and phrases exhibit the
same syntactic behaviour”. A good overview of the issue is given in Himmelmann
(2005).
Makalero, even though no member of the Austronesian family genetically, is spoken
in a larger area dominated by Austronesian languages, and it is similar to these
languages in several respects. Among those is the fact that the translational
equivalents of verbs and nouns can quite freely be used in both argument and
predicate positions, respectively. This characteristic is not commonly associated
with Papuan languages (see § 1.5, p. 12).","[120, 121, 122]"

On the other hand, in (181), teni ‘again’ is the predicate in a full clause, with its own

(179), these verbs can be used as separate adverbial clauses in multi-clause
sentences, too. In such cases, they are most often linked to the following clause by
means of a clause linker, as in (182) and (183), where the linker =ini is used. Note
that in this construction, the adverbial clause can either precede, as in (182), or
follow, as in (183), the main verb’s subject. 103 (180) above gives equivalent
evidence. Adverbial verbs with clause linkers cannot, however, appear in the VPinternal adverbial position.

valency, it is thus an avalent verb (§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141). It differs in this respect from
all other adverbial verbs which have been found in full verb use. For instance, teni
‘again’ is illustrated in (181), where it stands with a subject argument.","[185, 186]"
"NSIT ground-fall‘It is not the case that I fell down.’(elic1405a)6.7 Summary
Expressing Makalero clause structure in the terms proposed by Van Valin and
LaPolla’s Role and Reference Grammar is problematic in several respects. One
major difficulty is the fact that the VP-internal argument can be realised in two
distinct ways, namely either as an object or as a complement (§ 5.2, p. 319). These
two realisations are clearly distinct in their positions relative to both the clause
periphery and the aspect and negation operators. As a result, two separate schemes
(repeated in (64) and (65) from (3) and (4), respectively) are needed to represent the
Makalero clause.",[424]
"288CHAPTER 4modifiers are disallowed in such constructions; notably, the negator nomo can be
found in a ki=-modifier, as (68) shows.

deverbalised form, such as a participle (e.g. relative participles in Dravidian
languages, Krishnamurti 2003: 333). The reduced verbality of a ki=-modifier, as
demonstrated through the fact that they are incompatible with aspect marking and
adverbs, can be seen along those lines. Makalero speakers tend to translate such
attributes into Indonesian with relative sentences using yang (notice, too, that the
intended meaning of (66) as well as the literal translation of (63) take that form in
English). Like other modifiers, ki=-modifiers can form noun phrases of their own,
without a head noun (see § 4.1, p. 273). The sentence in (69) gives two relevant
examples. Such structures are reminiscent of headless relative clauses.

ATTR=contain1DEMcut=LNK1 take‘Somebody’s bananas were in the garden, (he) would go and put empty

(23-011)
On the other hand, a ki=-attribute can also be used as the predicate in a clause (see
§ 5.1, p. 318), in accordance with the fact that basically any lexeme or phrase can
function as a predicate if placed in the appropriate slot within a clause. With such
verbalised ki=-attributes, of course, verbal marking (e.g. adverbs, aspect) is possible,
as it is with predicates with prototypical verbal heads. The crucial difference to ki=attributes in NPs is that these verbal markers stand outside the ki=-phrase, rather

In the domain of morphology, Makalero resembles the Papuan language type with
respect to nominal inflection, which is largely non-existent (except for the fact that
there is in Makalero optional plural marking). Another possible analogy is TAM
marking, for which serial verb constructions are widespread in Papuan languages;
although the present thesis does not use the term SVC, the adverbial verbs used to
express the majority of the TAM categories in the form of distinct predications may
qualify as such. In all other respects, Makalero deviates from the Papuan language
type.","[38, 39]"

Ma’akini functions like a full verb translatable as ‘think / assume wrongly’. It takes
a complement clause extension, though the linkage between them is unmarked (see
§ 3.2.3.10.1.3, p. 191). (324) and (325) give examples, with the syntactic structure
marked through brackets. Even though ma’akini is never found in combination with
such VP modifiers as aspect marking or negation, it is the only possible predicative
element in the first clause of (324). It often follows a full clause, without any
linking, as in (325).

The element kini is undoubtedly related to the subordinating clause linker =kini
(§ 3.5.3.1.2.2, p. 258) which marks reported information as such. In fact, ma’akini is
optionally combined with =kini, cliticised to the complement clause’s subject
argument, as seen in (319). Table 3.40 summarises these patterns.

Whereas =kini does not make an assertion about the truth content of the reported
information, ma’akini marks it as wrong. The origin of the element ma’a is unclear.
However, the fact that ma’akini is a free-standing element, and in fact a full
predicate, suggests that ma’a is a verbal element making up its own clause.","[233, 234]"
"1.6.5 The verb phrase
Most of the complexity of Makalero grammar is found in the domain of the verb
phrase, which is strictly head-final. The main characteristic feature of the verb
phrase is that there are two distinct positions for the verb phrase-internal argument
(see § 5.2, p. 319). The first of these positions, termed object position, is the leftmost
element of the VP. It is followed by the aspect and negation markers as well as verbphrase-internal adverbials. The second position, labelled complement position,
immediately precedes the verb and in fact forms a morphosyntactic unit with it. This
unit may be overtly marked by the use of a reduced form of the complement or a
bound form of the verb, or both. The two argument positions are mutually exclusive.
Either of them fills the verb’s single non-subject argument position. While the object
position holds only undergoer NPs, the complement position can contain either
nominal or verbal constituents. The nominal constituents express either undergoers
or locations and goals. Verbal complements, which are fully-fledged VPs except for
the fact that the verb may be in a dependent form, generally convey locative or
manner information. This construction type is also used in forming causatives,
comparatives, modal modifications, directionality, and the like (§ 5.2.2.5, p. 339).
There is some degree of flexibility between the object position and the complement
position for nominal arguments. This holds particularly for pronominal undergoers,
the position of which varies considerably. In many instances, it is a lexical property
of a given verb whether a nominal argument is realised as an object or as a
complement.
Any ditransitive verb, even those which are semantically intransitive and thus not
associated with an undergoer participant, is compatible with a verbal complement
expressing location or manner. If such adverbial information is expressed in the
complement position, the undergoer (if one is associated with the verb in question)
can no longer stand in the same predication, but must be expressed in a separate
predication with the help of the light verb mei ‘take’. The complement thus fills the
verb’s argument position. The fact that even semantically intransitive verbs are
compatible with a complement shows that any verb is syntactically divalent.
Verbal modifiers include an aspect marker hai, expressing the beginning of a new
situation, a negator nomo as well as a variety of VP-internal adverbials. § 3.2.3.3.1
(p. 159) analyses these as a subclass of full verbs which can alternatively be used as
modifiers within the VP.",[48]
"CLS=LNK1=LNK1 ballpoint.pen 2DEMCLS.NEG1s=CTR‘The pen, not I took it…’take(101-178)Note that not only direct non-subject arguments can be left-dislocated into the LDP,
but also the arguments of complement VPs (§ 5.2.2.2, p. 326). In (15), for instance,
asi-upa Swiss isi’ ‘my father in Switzerland’ is an argument of the nese- ‘aim at
(RED)’, the verbal complement to ne’et ‘think’.
(15)… uai=ni=si[asi-papaSwiss-isi’]TOP ani na’u tepaCLS=LNK1=LNK2 1s:POSS-father S.-at1sjustconstantnese-ne’et...
aim.at:RED-think‘… so my father in Switzerland, I keep thinking about you...’ (106-12)
The fact that the clause’s object is topicalised does not mean, however, that the
subject automatically becomes the focus. Rather, a sentence like (14) contains
multiple topics; the first person narrator is the topic of the whole of the narration,
while lapizeira ‘ballpoint pen’ is the topic under discussion in this specific part of
the narration. Lambrecht (1996: 146ff.) allows for sentences with multiple topics,
claiming that what they assert is the relation between these multiple topics. This
claim seems to apply to such Makalero sentences as (14). The topic-status of the
object is atypical, hence it is made explicit by its position in the LDP. The subject,DISCOURSE STRUCTURE497on the other hand, is in its normal position, clause-initially, as well as in its normal
function, i.e. as a topic.
Lambrecht (1996: 176) introduces a number of topic promotion strategies, which are
“pragmatically motivated structural devices whose basic function is to PROMOTE
referents on the Topic Acceptability Scale from non-active (i.e. brand-new, unused,
or accessible (sic)) to active state in the discourse and hence from lexical to
unaccented pronominal coding in the sentence (…) [The] grammatical function [of
such topic promotion strategies, JH] is to match the requirements of syntactic
structure and information structure in cases where the two do not naturally
coincide.” Typical examples of topic promotion strategies in Makalero are often
seen in text-initial sentences as in (16), where the existence of the topic of the
discourse, the village of Ailebere, is predicated in the very first clause to make it
discourse-active. In the following sentence, it stands as a topic in the LDP.
(16)Ereasi-suku,[suku Ailebere] TOP kuandu uainhira lafu’ aira1DEM 1s:POSS-sucosucorihundouh ru fitu resi-douh=ini lafu’…urasaA.thousand one hundred sixwhenten seven rest-six=LNK1whenliveyearlive‘This is my suco, when the suco of Ailebere was founded in 1676…’
(35-01)
In other cases, the brand-new topic may be directly placed in the LDP, without an
activating clause. An example of this is (17).
(17)Asi-nokoJulieta ki-upa1s:POSS-younger.sibling J.obrigadu roual
thanksuere’=iniani k-asu3:POSS-father 2DEM.V=CTR 1smei=ni3:UND-forkini…many.NONHUM take=LNK1 give.to.3‘My sister Julieta’s father, I thank him much…’(105-001)Whether or not they include an activating clause, text-initial clauses, which
introduce a brand-new referent as a topic to the discourse, are pragmatically very
marked and conspicuously often involve non-canonical word order in Makalero.
A special, quite frequent subtype of topics in the left-detached position are nonargument topics, which play no grammatical role in the sentence that follows them,
but can be said to set a frame for the validity of said sentence. An example is given
in (18).

In (19) and (20), the LDP appears to hold constituents which are part of the focus
(i.e. that part of the proposition by which the assertion differs from the
presupposition, see Lambrecht 1996: 213), rather than topics. Note that in both
cases, the left-dislocated constituent is quite long and complicated. Also, in both
sentences, it is taken up again in the clause it is left-dislocated from in the form of
the resumptives uere or uere’ (§ 3.3.2.1, p. 232, and § 3.2.3.9.1, p. 183).

"1.6 A grammatical sketch of Makalero
The following sections give an overview of Makalero grammar. They largely follow
the overall organisation of the thesis (§ 1.10, p. 35). § 1.6.1 (p. 16) remarks briefly
on the make-up of the vocabulary, while § 1.6.2 (p. 19) discusses the phonology.
§ 1.6.3 (p. 21) sketches the lexical categories found in Makalero. § 1.6.4 (p. 22) and
§ 1.6.5 (p. 23), respectively, treat the noun phrase and the verb phrase. § 1.6.6
(p. 24) gives a short examination of the clause. § 1.6.7 (p. 24) and § 1.6.8 (p. 25)
discuss units larger than the clause, namely the sentence, the utterance and the text.
Finally, § 1.6.9 (p. 26) gives some remarks on discourse structure.",[41]
"INTRODUCTION351.10 Organisation of the grammar
The present descriptive grammar is organised into eight chapters. The first of these,
§ 2 (p. 37), discusses the phonology. Lexical categories and the morphology
associated with them are defined in § 3 (p. 97). § 4 (p. 273) and § 5 (p. 317)
elaborate on the noun phrase and the verb phrase, respectively. The remaining
chapters discuss the clause and units larger than the clause; § 6 (p. 383) is on the
clause and its constituent parts, § 7 (p. 401) on sentences and § 8 (p. 453) on
utterances. Finally, § 9 (p. 491) treats some issues on the discourse level.","[59, 60]"
"2DEM take.out-go.up=INT 1DEM difficult‘Then Lerenene wanted to go out, but it was difficult...’(64-14)Also, the modal verb so’ot ‘want’ has been found to denote a future time, as shown
in example (45). Such cases are rare; it does not seem as if this way of expression is
anywhere near grammaticalisation.

Apart from the general time adverbials discussed in § 7.2.1.1 (p. 414), there are also
avalent adverbial predicates which express specific points in time. A small selection
of these is given in (46).

time; they cannot constitute utterances of their own, but generally form one-word
clauses within a larger sentence. They are usually unmarked, but may take modifiers
and clause linkers. (47) and (48) give typical examples.

"CLS=PURP come=too‘Hopefully he will come.’(elic1741b)8. The utterance
An utterance is an actual instance of language in use. It is often made up of one or
more clausal units, but not necessarily so (see Payne 1997: 378, fn 1: “propositions
are not always expressed in the form of clauses, but also frequently in shorter
linguistic forms, such as phrases, interjections, or incomplete structures”). An
utterance is commonly defined as a “stretch of speech preceded and followed by
silence or a change of speaker” (Crystal 1991: 367). A potentially problematic
aspect of this definition (ibid.) is that the term thus comprises a wide variety of
speech units, ranging from one-word answers to complete sermons. A more
serviceable definition is given in Staden (2000: 207): an utterance is a “language
product, bounded by a final intonation contour” 191. Though some utterances under
this definition are still rather lengthy, it generally yields much more manageable
chunks of speech and is thus appropriated in the present work. The final intonation
contour of a declarative, shown in Figure 8.1 (repeated from Figure 7.1 above), is
distinctly falling and in clear contrast with the rising intonation of a declarative in
the middle of an utterance. For comparison, the bracketed clause in (2) and the
corresponding pitch contour in Figure 8.2 give an example of the latter (for
intonation contours of other sentence types, see § 7.7, p. 435).
