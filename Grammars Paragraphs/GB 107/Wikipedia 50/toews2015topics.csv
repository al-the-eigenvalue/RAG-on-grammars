where the basic word order is S(Aux)OV whereas particles occur in clauses where the basic
word order is S(Part)VO. Thus, negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order from SVO in
the affirmative (35a) to S(Aux)OV in the negative (76b). Negative particles do not have such an
effect (77b).
Notice in (78) that the object kùà and the verb nu are reversed from one example to the
next: the negative perfective has OV word order while the negative imperfective has VO word
order. It also appears that the verbs are uninflected in this case, since the verb for the perfective
(78a) and imperfective utterances have the same form.",[178]

The particle wo has some characteristics of a negative polarity item (NPI): Wo occurs mainly in
negative clauses, but it is not obligatory in negative clauses. It can also occur in certain types of
affirmative questions (Adger 2003). The data available at this point are compatible with it being
an NPI, so that is how I have chosen to gloss it.",[81]

Imperfectives are negated by a particle. The particle does not cause a change in word order. In
the affirmative sentence in (77a), the verb (na) precedes the object (tawa), the same as (76a). In
the negative sentence (77b), the verb still precedes the object.

"2.5 How Siamou Fits into the Kru Language Family
Kru is a language family with 39 members, according to Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2013). In the
following sections, I describe some basic characteristics of Kru languages (2.5.1), and I show
how Siamou is an outlier both geographically (2.5.2) and linguistically (2.5.3). In 2.5.4 I provide
a list of all the Kru languages.
2.5.1. Characteristics of Kru Languages
Kru languages have an S Aux OV word order66, and sometimes an S (Part) VO word order
(2.5.1.1). They are also characterized by complex tone systems (2.5.1.2) and a basic aspectual
contrast of perfective and imperfective (2.5.1.3).
2.5.1.1 Kru Languages Are SVO and S Auxiliary OV
Kru languages have mixed word order properties. If there is no auxiliary, the word order is SVO
but in certain environments (such as negative clauses), the order may change to S Auxiliary OV.
The affirmative clause in (127a) has SVO order, but when the same clause is negated with an
auxiliary (127b), the order of the object and the verb is reversed, and the order is S Aux OV.

both the nominal and verbal domains. First, plurals are marked with a suffix (37a), and so is
imperfective aspect (37b).

"125The verbs in (Table 3.37k-n) all have a coda r while none of the other verbs in this table do. In these verbs (but
not the others), /i/ is pronounced [ɪ], and this is likely related to the fact that they pattern differenctly in the
perfective and imperfective forms (Paul Thiessen p.c).
126
The verb form dénno is unusual. It often acts as the perfective of the verb don (go). However, the actual (regular)
perfective of don is dòn. There are rules governing the use of dòn versus dénno which I am not very familiar with.
However, the first form occurs more in negative clauses and the latter occurs more in affirmative clauses. The verb
form dénno patterns differently in the grammar as well. For example, dénno can occur with the non-finite particle ki,
which no other perfective can do, suggesting that it is probably not a perfective, although it functions as one in many
cases. It is possible that dénno is multi-morphemic. Siamou has a suffix -no which means something like 'go', and
this suffix can attach to some other bare verbs. I am not sure what the dén would be in that case.
Throughout this thesis, I have glossed dénno as go.PRFV?. The ? indicates that I am not sure of its status.",[188]

In fact, in rare cases it is even possible to have two instances of ín in the same negative
clause, one preceding negation and one following it (103a). If there was only one ín after bo and
none before it, it was judged slightly less acceptable (103b). Two instances of ín both preceding
bo was definitely unacceptable (103c). Just one ín preceding bo was the most acceptable (103d).",[91]

raiseThese data lead Marchese (1986) to hypothesize that the Proto-Kru imperfective had both a
subject suffix and a verbal suffix. She postulates the form S-a V-e (or possibly S-a V-le) for the
Proto-Kru imperfective. Nasal consonants are never mentioned in connection with Kru
imperfective aspect. This appears to be a Siamou innovation, or it may be the counterpart to the
/l/ found in other Kru langauges. Irregular Siamou verbs, however, have remnants of the original
Kru suffix. The regular form of the imperfective does not have /l/, but this is a common
characteristic of irregular imperfectives, and sometimes irregular perfectives as well.118 The
irregular verbs do more to connect the Siamou imperfective to the Kru imperfective than the
regular ones. In a more general way, Siamou regular imperfectives do pattern with other Kru
imperfectives in that they differ segmentally from the bare verb, whereas perfectives do not.
3.4.4 Aspectual Inflection and Negation: Siamou Diverges from Kru
There is a strategy for differentiating the perfective and imperfective in Kru which does not exist
in Siamou. All the Kru languages in Marchese's (1986) study for which she had the relevant data
had different negation strategies for the perfective and imperfective.
3.4.4.1 Perfective Uses Negative Auxiliary with OV Order
All perfectives in the Kru languages discussed by Marchese (1986) are negated by an auxiliary.
The auxiliary causes the word order to change from VO to OV. Example (76a) shows an
affirmative perfective. Notice that the verb (pi) precedes the object (sayɛ̀). Example (76b) is a
perfective negated by the auxiliary se. In this sentence, the object precedes the verb.
116The Vata examples in Table 3.28 are from Vogler (1974:395), discussed in Marchese (1986:51).
The Siamou examples in Table 3.28 are originally from Prost (1964), discussed in Marchese 1986:51). The
double vowels of the current forms are an orthographic convention. See 1.3.5.

"Above the aspect phrase there is a locative phrase which contains two particles fɔn 'be here' and
mí 'be there.' I put these two particles in the same syntactic position because they are in
complementary distribution and because they are both locatives. I put them at the bottom of all
the functional particles because whenever they occur with another pre-predicate particle they are
always to the right of the other particle (e.g. ri fɔn, wo mí) (see 2.3.4.2.8).
The head right above the locative phrase I have called a functional phrase (FP), for lack
of a better name, and it contains the modal particle bè and the negative polarity particle wo. I put50these particles in the same syntactic position because they never co-occur. I put them above the
locative phrase because wo precedes mí if they co-occur (wo mí).
The next level up is the finite phrase which contains the non-finite particle ki and the
finite particle ri. (The labels for these particles is also tentative.) I put these particles in the same
syntactic position because they never co-occur and because they both seem to have something to
do with finiteness. If ki or ri occur with another pre-predicate particle, they are always to the left
of the other particle (e.g. ki bè, ri bè, ki wo, ri mí).
Above the finite phrase is the TP, which contains the right edge particle ín. This particle
precedes all other right edge particles (see 2.3.4.3). I placed the TP as close as possible to the
finite phrase, since I expect both of them to be part of the IP.
The phrase above TP is the NegP which contains the right edge particle bo (sometimes
be) NEG. I put this particle above ín PAST because ín always precedes bo (although see (103a.)).
Above this is the CP, which contains the pre-predicate particle nì 'if/when.' This particle
is in complementary distribution with ki and ri in the finite phrase. Nonetheless, I chose to give it
its own position because of its function. That is, it seems to fit into the CP better than the IP.
Immediately above the CP is another functional phrase that contains two right-edge
particles: a polar question particle a and an emphatic particle na. I put these particles in the same
position because they never co-occur. I put them above the NegP because they always follow
negation (be a, bo na).
The highest level in the tree is the quotative phrase which contains the quotative particle
dé. I placed this particle at the top because it precedes all other elements of the phrase. Since I
am focusing on functional particles, this tree does not include the subject of the sentence.
However, I assume that the subject is generated inside the VP and raises to a position higher in
the clause. In Siamou the subject precedes all pre-predicate particles. The only particle that
precedes the subject is the quotative dé. Therefore, the subject likely raises as high as the CP.
The subsections below look in more detail at each these functional elements. In 2.3.4.1 I
introduce the quotative, dé, in 2.3.4.2 the set of seven pre-predicate particles, and 2.3.4.3 the set
of four right-edge particles. The final section, 2.3.4.4, is about some unusual verb stems.","[72, 73]"

"It is sometimes useful to give questions in pairs so that the consultant can contrast

one perfective utterance with a matching imperfective utterance.
Sometimes it is helpful to briefly explain your purpose in eliciting certain data.
This may prevent the consultant from getting frustrated when, for example, you
purposefully ask about a bunch of ungrammatical sentences to get negative data

have an imperfective inchoative interpretation when inflected for imperfective aspect.","[273, 274]"
"According to our definitions of future tense and prospective aspect, the data in (47)
shows that these are not future tense, but prospective aspect.
7.3.4 The Three Future Expressions Can Refer to Events That Are Not Expected to
Happen
The previous three diagnostics support my claim that Siamou's three future expressions encode
prospective aspect. In this and the next section I show that in addition to expressing prospective
aspect, these future expressions are also all modal. To prove that they are modal, I show that in
certain contexts, a speaker can utter a future expression even if he is quite sure that the event he
is referring to will not actually occur (48). If the future expressions in Siamou were purely
temporal, this would not be possible. This is because modality allows for branching futures in
which more than one outcome is possible—some in which the event occurs, and some in which it
does not. A future that is purely temporal (which likely does not exist) would only have one
possible outcome. Example (48c) is particularly interesting because the affirmative of the certain
future is followed by the negation of the simple future with no contradiction.

Other similarities between Siamou and other Kru languages include a number of grammatical
morphemes that appear to be cognates (such as the negative particle bo in Siamou and the
negative particle be in Grebo), and word order, both in the verbal and nominal domains. Person
(1966) also gives a historical explanation for the geographical distance between Siamou and the
other Kru languages, arguing that Kru languages were originally spoken further north than they
are now, in Ivory Coast and Liberia, until the Mandé and the Maninka pushed them out. Most of
them moved south, except for the Siamou, who fled north into Burkina Faso (Person 1966).

from the other dialects mainly in phonetics and phonology. He systematically works through the
possible sound combinations and syllable structures. He discusses how words borrowed from
Jula are changed to fit Siamou phonology (usually by changing three-syllable words into two60Plawi (or Plaoui) is spoken in Ivory Coast (Person 1966). Marchese (1983:115) lists it as a Grebo dialect.","[100, 101]"

"952.5.3 Siamou Is an Outlier Relative to Other Kru Languages
Of the 39 Kru languages, most fit into two branches: a western branch (23 languages) and an
eastern branch (11 languages). Of the remaining five languages, three belong to the Aiza group,
spoken in Ivory Coast. Two languages, Kuwaa and Siamou, do not belong to any subgroup
(Marchese 1983, Lewis et al. 2013).
This means that we expect Siamou not to show stronger similarity to Western Kru
languages than to Eastern Kru languages, nor the other way around. It may have some properties
that resemble Western Kru languages, some that resemble Eastern Kru languages, and some
properties that are distinct from both. Chapter 3 looks at how Siamou perfective and imperfective
aspect compare with these aspects in Kru. I argue that the Siamou perfective is a L tone suffix.
However, in surface form, sometimes the L tone surfaces, and sometimes it does not. In Kru, the
general pattern is that the Western branch has an unmarked perfective and the Eastern branch has
a L tone perfective. Thus, the surface forms of Siamou perfectives sometimes resemble Western
Kru perfectives and sometimes resemble Eastern Kru perfectives. Siamou differs from both
Western and Eastern Kru languages, however, in the formation of negative perfectives. In the
other languages, negating a perfective structure with a negative auxiliary causes a change in
word order from VO to OV. In Siamou, the word order is always OV, and there is no change in
word order when perfectives are negated.
2.5.4 List of Kru Languages
Below is a list of all the Kru languages according to Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2013). They are
sorted according to family groupings: first the western branch, then the eastern branch, the Aizi
grouping, and finally the two outliers: Kuwaa and Seme (Siamou). The country each language is

This chapter was an overview of the Siamou language. There are 32 phonemes and eight
tone melodies. Siamou has a S (Part) OV word order, and lexical heads follow their
complements. The extended nominal projection contains adnominals, NP suffixes that mark
plurality and definiteness, a left-edge definite particle and a possessive particle ǹ. In the extended
verbal projection there is a clause-initial quotative particle, a number of pre-predicate particles,
clause-final particles, and some unusual verb stems. Section 2.4 provided some background on
Siamou, including demographics (2.4.1), a review of the literature relating to Siamou (2.4.2) and
a brief description of Siamou culture (2.4.3). The last section (2.5) was a description of how
Siamou fits into the Kru language family. In short, it shares some properties with other Kru
languages, but it is a geographical and genetic outlier.","[117, 118, 119, 120]"

"5.4 A Curious Gap: Siamou Lacks Stative Verbs
It would be good to have a complete and well-defined inventory of event types in a language
before attempting an analysis of grammatical aspect. Unfortunately, I do not have enough data to
provide information about all of Siamou's event types. However, I would like to discuss the
status of stative verbs in Siamou in the following sub-sections. As for the remaining event types,
I assume for now that Siamou has the same standard Vendler (1957) event types, namely:
activities, achievements, and accomplishments.
According to the data available at this time, it appears that Siamou has no stative verbs.
Instead, there are at least four other strategies for expressing stativity: non-verbal predicates
(5.4.1), the grammatical aspect suffix -ɲɛ̀n (5.4.2), imperfectives of certain eventives (5.4.3), and
perfectives of inchoative verbs (5.4.4).
5.4.1 Being a Stative Predicate: Lexical Statives Are Always Non-Verbal
The first strategy to express stativity is non-verbal stative predicates, such as the ones in (47-49).
This type of predicate is very common in Siamou. Some are formed with a post-positional phrase
(47), others with a copular particle ɔ (48),204 and still others with adjectives (49) or the noun shi
'knowledge/life (50).
The phrases in (47g-i) express wanting. The thing that is wanted is in brackets.
47.",[274]
"(Godié; Marchese 1986:31)In Section 5.5, I look at factatives in more detail. I argue that in Siamou, the factative
effect is not needed to explain the present stative interpretation of certain perfective-marked198For Siamou, the only information that appears to have been available was Prost (1964), which labels the
perfective and imperfective past and present respectively.

and that a past interpretation is not acceptable for the examples in (41).",[271]

My goal in the next chapter is to establish the truth and felicity conditions for two Siamoumorphemes: the low tone suffix that I have been calling perfective aspect, and the -n suffix that I
hav been calling imperfective aspect, and to see how closely they match commonly accepted
truth and felicity conditions for perfectives and imperfectives. In a language, when a certain
phonological form regularly occurs in an utterance in conjunction with a consistent meaning or
set of meanings, we associate that form with the meaning(s) accompanying it. We like to give the
form some kind of name or label to identify it. Since similar sets of meanings occur in many
different languages, if the interpretation of a particular form in one language is similar to one that
occurs in one or more other languages, it is useful, for the sake of cross-linguistic comparison, to
give them the same name. Therefore, I will test whether or not the Siamou low tone suffix fits
the general definition for perfective aspect, and whether or not the Siamou -n suffix fits the
general definition for imperfective aspect. I will also determine how closely the meanings
associated with these forms match meanings associated with other forms with the same label in
other languages. If the Siamou forms have meanings similar to forms in other languages that are
called perfective or imperfective, it is sensible to give the Siamou forms the same name. This is
not to say they are equivalent, but they have some basic features in common.
In order to reach the goal of establishing truth and felicity conditions, we need a way of
formalizing concepts so that a language can be examined systematically. This is the purpose of a
theoretical framework. It provides a vocabulary and allows us to define the terms perfective and
imperfective. Using these definitions, we can make predictions about the behaviour of these
forms, and then test these predictions by eliciting utterances, along with truth and felicity
judgments, from native speakers of a language. These tests are called diagnostics. Over the next
few pages, I discuss the theoretical framework that I adopt for my analysis of the Siamou verb
forms that correspond to the perfective and imperfective.
Perfective and imperfective aspect both belong to the category of grammatical aspect.
However, their deployment is sensitive to the lexical properties of the verbs that they combine
177with. Therefore, in order to understand the perfective and imperfective, which are instances of
grammatical aspect, we need to consider how lexical aspect interacts with grammatical aspect. In
the following two subsections, I look first at two theories of grammatical aspect (4.2.1) and then
at lexical aspect (4.2.2).
4.2.1 Theory 1: Event Time Fully Contained in Reference Time (Kratzer 1998)
This section explores two theories of grammatical aspect—from now on simply aspect— that are
very closely related, but different. The first is from Kratzer (1998) (4.2.1.1) and the second from
Klein (1994) (4.2.1.2). I show that while Klein and Kratzer have the same definition for
imperfective aspect, Klein's definition of perfective aspect is slightly broader than Kratzer's
(4.2.1.3), and I discuss the implications of adopting the second type of perfective.
For Kratzer (1998), perfective aspect arises when the event time is contained within the
reference time (time(e) ⊆ time(r)). Imperfective aspect arises when the reference time is
contained within the event time (or, in other words, the event time extends past the boundaries of
the reference time) (time(r) ⊆ time(e)). These two definitions are formalized in (12) below, from
Kratzer (1998:17).

tomatoes and peppers is a process that involves bringing a pile of sheets up from the basement,
dragging them to the garden, unfolding them, and so on. The difference between states and

1.1.2 How Tense and Aspect Are Deployed in Siamou: The Empirical Stakes
Linguists are involved in a search for uniformity and diversity across languages. To understand
how language works, it is important to know what languages have in common, and also in what
ways they are different. Our knowledge of tense and aspect is gathered from looking at a variety
2of languages. The more languages are studied, the more we can refine and develop this
knowledge. This thesis is about how tense and aspect works in Siamou: how it is like other
languages (uniformity) and how it is different (diversity).
As an example of a way in which languages are diverse, here is a basic contrast between
two unrelated languages: English and Siamou. In English, sentences must be marked for tense,
but not aspect. This means that you can say (4a) with past tense ate, but not (4b) with unmarked
eat. Although there is no aspect marking in (4a), it is still grammatical.

"1.3 Overview of the Thesis
The dissertation is structured as follows: Chapter 2 is a descriptive overview of Siamou
grammar. Chapter 3 focuses on the morpho-phonology and morpho-syntax of Siamou aspect.
Chapter 4 introduces the background on theories of perfective and imperfective aspect, including
a set of diagnostics for both. Chapter 5 uses these diagnostics to show that Siamou has a L tone
suffix that encodes perfective aspect and a M tone nasal suffix that encodes imperfective aspect.
Chapter 6 analyzes the sentence-final particle ín as a past tense, with a number of associated
implicatures. Chapter 7 is a description and preliminary analysis of Siamou future expressions.
Chapter 8 is the conclusion. Since these chapters cover a range of topics, it is possible to read
most of them independently, except for chapter 5 which relies heavily on concepts introduced in
chapter 4. In the following subsections, I give a preview of the major findings of each of these
chapters.
1.3.1 The Grammatical Sketch
Chapter 2 provides background information about Siamou grammar and a brief description of
Siamou's phonology, including the inventory of consonants and vowels, syllable structure, and
tone. This chapter also surveys Siamou syntax, with information about basic word order (SOV),
and some detail about the nominal projection and the verbal projection. The discussion of the
nominal projection covers pronouns, modifiers, plurality, definiteness, possession and
nominalized verbs. The discussion of the verbal projection focuses on functional particles,
11including a left-edge quotative particle, seven pre-predicate particles, and four right-edge
particles, concluding with a brief description of verb stems. The final portion of this chapter is a
short introduction to the Kru language family that shows how Siamou fits in. Siamou is an
outlier among the Kru languages both geographically and genetically. This chapter is important
because information about Siamou grammar is scarce and difficult to access. This is the first time
some of this information has been made available. It is also an important tool for understanding
this thesis. The remaining chapters focus on issues pertaining to tense and aspect. The
background provided in this chapter is intended to make the data in the following chapters more
comprehensible.
1.3.2 The Morpho-Phonology and Morpho-Syntax of Aspect in Siamou
Chapter 3 hones in on aspect. Siamou has a set of six aspectual morphemes that are all verbal
suffixes. These suffixes are partitioned into three inflectional tone classes: a low tone class,
which includes perfective (marked by a low tone suffix -L), completive -è, and stative -ɲɛ̀n; a
mid tone class, which includes imperfective -n and prospective aspect 1 -a; and a high-low tone
class, which includes prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂. There are two possible analyses for the morphosyntax of Siamou aspect. The first, following Kayne's (1994) anti-symmetry theory, is that
Siamou has an underlying VO word order and that the verb rises to a higher aspect position
while the object rises to an even higher position. The second possibility, which is supported by
data from the Kru language family, and which I adopt, is that the underlying word order is OV
and that the aspectual suffix attaches to the verb via right-alignment.
Regarding the internal structure of the aspect phrase, data from Siamou is consistent with
an independently motivated structure (Tenny 2000, Liao 2005) in which the aspect phrase is
divided into a lower aspect head and a higher aspect head. In Siamou, the lower head contains
perfective and imperfective aspect, and the higher head contains the remaining aspects:
completive -è, stative -ɲɛ̀n, prospective aspect 1 -a, and prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂. Although I
have not analyzed the completive and stative suffixes, preliminary results indicate that they both
resemble perfects in some ways, which means that they fit into the category of grammatical
aspect. The perfective -L and the imperfective -n differ from the other aspect suffixes in that they
have less phonological content, and in that they have morphological irregularities, which the
other suffixes do not. If there are two levels of aspect, stacking is predicted to occur. Siamou12does not allow stacking of aspectual suffixes on a single verb. However, it appears that stacking
may occur in complex structures that involve an auxiliary verb and a nominal form.
This chapter also contains a comparison of Siamou perfective and imperfective aspect
with perfective and imperfective aspect in Kru, the language family to which Siamou belongs.
Siamou perfectives and imperfectives are similar in many ways to Kru perfectives and
imperfectives, including elements such as tone and segmental form. However, while Kru negates
perfectives differently than imperfectives, Siamou negates all finite phrases the same way. The
final part of this chapter contains an appendix that gives a detailed description of irregular verb
forms. This chapter is important because it identifies many of the morphemes that are the focus
of the following chapters, in particular the perfective and imperfective. Since these aspectual
suffixes are marked mainly suprasegmentally by tone, they are not easy to pick out in a phrase.
This chapter is the net that catches the butterflies I wish to study.
1.3.3 The Semantics of the Perfective and the Imperfective
Chapter 4 is largely a review of the literature on topics relating to perfective and imperfective
aspect with formal definitions and descriptions of tense and aspect, as well as perfective and
imperfective aspect. Klein (1994) and Kratzer (1998) have different definitions of perfective
aspect that make different predictions, but they have the same definition for imperfective aspect.
This chapter provides an overview of lexical aspect, and discusses the interaction of lexical
aspect with grammatical aspect. The final section is devoted to collecting a set of diagnostics for
perfective and imperfective aspect. These diagnostics are tailored for a language in which the
perfective has a default past interpretation and the imperfective has a default present
interpretation. For the perfective, it is necessary to show that it is not past tense, and that the
default past interpretation is actually expected for perfectives. For the imperfective, it is
necessary to show that it is not present tense, and that the default present interpretation is
expected for imperfectives. Diagnostics for perfective and imperfective aspect also rely on
termination and culmination entailments, and the interpretation of inflected verbs with adverbial
modifiers.
1.3.4 The Semantics of the Perfective and the Imperfective in Siamou
Chapter 5 uses the diagnostics from chapter 4 to diagnose perfective and imperfective aspect in
Siamou, focusing on a subset of the aspectual morphemes from chapter 3: the low tone suffix -L,13and the mid tone nasal suffix -n. The diagnostics for perfective aspect show that the low tone
suffix -L meets the criteria for perfective aspect. These diagnostics also reveal that perfective
aspect in Siamou has a strong default past interpretation, but is not past tense. The diagnostics for
imperfective aspect show that the mid tone nasal suffix -n meets the criteria for imperfective
aspect. Once these morphemes have been identified, they are compared and contrasted with
perfective and imperfective aspect in other Kru languages. The final part of this chapter explores
an intriguing discovery about the Siamou language that is revealed by these diagnostics: Siamou
has no stative main verbs.
1.3.5 The Semantics of Past Tense ín and its Implicatures
Chapter 6 focuses on the sentence final particle ín. This particle marks past tense, which
indicates that the reference time of an utterance precedes its speech time no matter which
aspectual suffix it occurs with. Siamou aspect suffixes can be categorized according to whether
they have a default past interpretation, a default present interpretation, or a future interpretation.
The particle ín always causes these types of utterances to shift their interpretation to the past. The
second part of this chapter looks at a number of implicatures of the particle ín. An implicature is
a meaning that an utterance has beyond what is actually stated. The implicatures of ín include the
following readings: remote past, counterfactual, and cessation, and also possibly politeness and
doubt. These readings are mostly predicted from the basic past tense meaning of ín. However,
the way in which the politeness and doubt readings arise is not clear.
1.3.6 The Semantics of Futurity in Siamou
The displacement property of language allows us to speak not only of what has already happened
in the past, but about what will happen in the future. Chapter 7 looks at Siamou's three future
expressions. These three expressions involve a total of three syntactic positions: an aspectual
position (which contains one of two prospective aspect suffixes, -a or -bɛ̂), a modal position
(containing the pre-predicate particle bè) and a finiteness position (containing the pre-predicate
particle ri). These positions are shown in the tree in (15).","[33, 34, 35, 36]"

8.1.3.3 Past: Is it Tense or Adverb?
I claim in this dissertation (see 6.3) that the past particle ín is a tense morpheme.
However, really this is an unresolved theoretical issue because depending on what the criteria are
taken to be, this morpheme could be analyzed as either tense or adverb. In order to make the
claim that I do, I have to specifically state that for me the most important diagnostic for past
tense is that a morpheme shifts or restricts reference time to past. If one considers the fact that ín
is not obligatory and is not in paradigmatic contrast with any other tense morphemes, it begins to
look more like an adverb. However, ín does not pattern like other adverbs in Siamou. It does not
have the same syntactic distribution as other adverbs (It is more restricted.), and it does not have
the same phonological form (It begins with a vowel.). The table from 6.3 with the relevant
diagnostics is repeated below.",[404]
"6.4. Deriving the Implicatures of Siamou Past Tense ín
Implicatures are very common in language (Grice 1967, Jaczsolt 2009, among others), and they
may make up the most salient meaning of an utterance, so it is not surprising to find that ín can
have so many implicatures and that sometimes they can even be more salient than the lexical
meaning of past tense, especially if the utterance has a past construal independently of ín. In this
section I examine the following five meanings of ín (74), show that at least three of them are
conversational implicatures of past tense, and explore the contexts in which they arise.

non-detatchable (i.e. an utterance with the same general semantic content in the
same context will have the same implicature)

different truth conditions than literal meaning
indeterminate (hard to pin down a precise meaning)305I show that each of the past tense implicatures has at least some of these properties, especially
the property of being cancelable.
6.4.1 Deriving the Remote Past Implicature
When utterances that have a default past interpretation are marked with past tense ín, they are
often interpreted as being more distant in the past than the same utterance without ín. I argued in
6.3.3 that ín always marks past tense, even when it modifies default past expressions. If the
meaning of the utterance is already past, then adding the past tense ín would not change it. This
is not really a problem - redundancy is pervasive in language. However, if ín is not required to be
part of a sentence to contribute past tense, and it is not required to be part of a sentence to make
that sentence grammatical, then we have to ask what reason a speaker might have for adding this
particle to their utterance. If speakers are obeying the rules of conversation and not randomly
adding bits of phonology (which would be flouting the maxim of manner (Be clear and concise.)
and also perhaps the maxim of quantity (Don't say more than necessary.), then we have to
assume that ín is contributing something. The audience, if they assume the speaker is obeying the
rules of conversation, must also assume that ín is contributing something. Perhaps they say to
themselves, ""If she is marking something as past that is already past, it must really be past!"" And
thus we get a conversational implicature meaning of remote past.
The remote past meaning is easy to cancel by context. For example, if ín is used in a
context that indicates that the speaker is expecting a response from the listener, then it does not
have a remote past meaning. The utterance in (76) is not incompatible with a remote past
reading, but in the given context, the speaker is wondering why the other person has asked if he's
already had his turn. In this case, ín does not indicate remoteness, but an indirect (or polite) way
of asking for a response.

I have, so I say this. I'm wondering why they're asking.
consultant comment: This could mean that this is further in the past (than the same
utterance without ín), OR it could mean that you're wondering why they're asking you
this question.
306By hypothesis, ín is a lexical past tense marker, and the utterance has a default past
interpretation without ín. Co-operative communication principles require the listener to assume
that the speaker has some reason for adding a past tense marker to an utterance that is already
interpreted as past, and this causes the inference that the event might be more distant in the past.
The context also has to support the listener's inference. If, for example, the context supports the
inference that the speaker is trying to be polite, rather than indicate remoteness, then there will be
no remoteness implicature.
Unlike remote past tenses in many other languages, ín does not have a temporal cut-off
point. It is compatible with events earlier on the same day, or events from yesterday, or events
from the distant past. It serves to make whatever event predicate it modifies more remote, but
there is no clear indication of what counts as remote. This indeterminacy is odd for a remote past
tense marker, but expected of an implicature.
The fact that implicatures are non-detachable leads us to ask why past tense markers in
other languages, such as English -ed do not have a remoteness implicature. Example (77a) has a
present interpretation, and (77b), with -ed, has a past interpretation, but no remoteness
implicature.

"2.3.4 The Extended Verbal Projection
The tree in (58) below is a schema that represents my current understanding of Siamou's
extended verbal projection.
At the bottom of the tree is the VP with the head (V) and the object (DP). Immediately
above that is the first aspect phrase, which contains perfective and imperfective aspect, and then
the second aspect phrase which contains stative, completive, prospective aspect 1 and
prospective aspect 2. (See 3.3 for arguments that support splitting the aspect phrase into two
levels.)
The higher levels of the verbal projection contain a total of twelve functional particles:
one clause initial particle, seven pre-predicate particles, and four right-edge particles. No single
Siamou sentence contains all these particles. The pre-predicate particles are more restricted than
the right-edge particles. No more than two pre-predicate particles can occur in one sentence (see
2.3.4.2.8). The ordering of the particles in this tree is very tentative, and is based on cooccurrence restrictions and ordering relations between them. The following paragraphs discuss
the rationale behind the tree in (58).",[71]

NEG2.3.4.3 Right-Edge Particles
Siamou has four main particles that occur at the right edge: a past tense particle ín (see chapter
6), a negation particle bo, a question particle a, and an emphatic particle na. In this section I
introduce them and examine their ordering and co-occurrence restrictions.
2.3.4.3.1 Past Tense ín
The first right-edge particle, ín, is a marker of past tense. I explore its semantics in
chapter 5. Here I look at its position in the clause. In simple finite clauses, ín only has one
possible position: at the right edge (99). In (99a) ín is both immediately after the verb, and clause
final. It cannot occur before the main verb in any position at all (99b-e).

"This sentence can be said in reference to a person who was forbidden to eat for a day in order to
have a medical procedure done. After the procedure, she is allowed to eat, but she feels sick and
has no appetite. The first can has to do with permission, and the second can has to do with
physical ability. This tells us that even though on the surface it may seem that the Siamou phrase
À bè du-a has the same meaning as the English phrase He will climb, they are actually different
from each other in a very important way.
To show how unrelated languages sometimes display uniformity, let us take an example
from the category of viewpoint aspect. In English, utterances like (9a) and (9b) have a very clear
contrast. The first one means that the rain started falling after I was done picking tomatoes, but
the second one means that the rain started falling while I was still picking. This is an aspectual
contrast.

"3.2.1.2 Siamou Is Consistently Head-Final
In Siamou, sentences always have surface SOV word order, as shown in (21) above. In fact, all
lexical heads in Siamou follow their complements. This is true for verb phrases (24a), noun
phrases (24b) and postpositional phrases (24c).95

Fɔn and mí, are locative particles. Fɔn is used to describe events that are taking place or took
place at the current location of the speaker. It occurs in non-verbal predicates, such as the last

Table 3.30 summarizes the findings about the general patterns of Kru perfectives and
imperfectives as discussed above and compares them with the Siamou perfective and
imperfective.

unmarked group and marked (low tone) group. As in other Kru languages, when it is marked, it
is a tonal suffix on the verb. It does not change the segmental form of the bare verb (except for
irregular verbs in Siamou). The Siamou imperfective also resembles other Kru imperfectives in
some ways: it is always marked in some way, it bears mid tone, it has segmental content, and it is
suffixal. However, while the Siamou imperfective is marked by a nasal consonant suffix on the
verb, the Kru imperfective is generally marked by a vowel, and sometimes the consonant /l/, and
it may be either a verbal suffix or a suffix on the subject, or both. Siamou is part of the group that
marks it on the verb. Irregular imperfective forms in Siamou show some similarities with the
form of the Kru imperfective, which I show in an appendix to chapter 3, following the
conclusion.","[179, 180]"

He read a book while his wife slept.
literal: The time at which he read a book, at that time his wife was sleeping.
French: Il a lu un livre pendant que sa femme dormait. (L)DEMcontext: He read the whole book while she was asleep (beginning after she fell
asleep and finishing before she woke up)
Then, using only the Siamou phrases, I attempted to determine in what types of contexts these
phrases were felicitous. In particular, I tried to determine whether or not utterances with a
perfective verb were used for situations in which the event time was contained within the
reference time (i.e. a Kratzer-type (1998) perfective, or a sub-type of Klein's (1994) perfectives),
and whether or not utterances with an imperfective verb were used for events in which the
reference time was contained within the event time. Note that for (26b), a context in which the
man reads the whole book while his wife is asleep was accepted. This is consistent with it being
a perfective utterance. However, I was not able to determine the felicity status of a context in
which he began reading before she fell asleep and continued after she woke up.
For the most part I was not able to get consistent results for these utterances. Part of the
issue may be my method of asking questions. Since French is not my first language, there is
always the possibility of a misunderstanding based on my wording of questions. Another
confounding issue may be the fact that the Siamou translations of the French phrases reverse the
order of the main and subordinate clauses, so that the French phrase is literally She cooked tô
while I watched her and the Siamou phrase is literally The time at which she cooked tô, at that
time I was watching her. Therefore, in one language the perfective aspect-marked phrase she
cooked tô occurs in the main clause and in the other it occurs in the subordinate clause. The
examples in (28) above are of perfective-marked verbs in subordinate clauses. The examples in
(29) are the imperfective counterparts to the phrases in (28). Contextual information is not
available for these examples either.",[413]
"57The final context in which ki occurs is in irrealis contexts. Modal phrases which take
subordinate clauses have a ki + bare verb in the subordinate clause, for example, in order to say
