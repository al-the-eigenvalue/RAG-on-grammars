"7.6.2 Supposition (supp)
Another particle, mera, marks the epistemic status of an action or event as something that has been assumed but that the speaker believes does not correspond to
what actually happened. In other words, it is what Tayap speakers use to convey
a meaning like ‘I thought Paita had gone to Wongan’. A statement like that in
English conveys a belief that regardless of whether or not Paita did go to Wongan,
the speaker expected him to but believes that he did not.
The modal particle mera that carries this meaning follows whatever part of
speech is the focus of the assumption. So it can occur after a noun, as in the
following:
(7-43)ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
ŋa ndɨ nda nam
-nak
Ŋgeman =ŋi
mera
1sg dm dm talk.r -1sg.f|1pl.r Ŋgeman =erg.m supp
‘I (f) thought it was Ŋgeman’ (who did it, but it wasn’t)Most commonly, mera follows a verb, thereby reframing what would have been a
statement as a supposition. For example:
(7-44) ŋa namnet ŋɨ Potore okɨnet mera
ŋa nam -net
ŋɨ
Poto
=re
1sg talk.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r 3sg.m Wongan =all
o
-kɨ
-net
mera
go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr supp
‘I (m) thought he would go to Wongan’ (but he didn’t)
Without the modal particle, this sentence would mean ‘I thought: he will go
to Wongan’. Mera turns the statement into an assumption that, moreover, the
speaker believes did not come to pass. Note that these constructions always
involve the use of a phrase like ‘I thought’ or ‘I lied’ as exemplified here.
The particle is also to express the action of having been fooled or lied to. So
‘they lied to us that you were dead’ is:Mood particles(7-45)227ŋgɨgi yim takwattɨmɨro yu wasowtet mera

Kapa encodes surprise. It follows nominals and the closest colloquial English
translation would be the expression ‘that damned X’ in both its positive and negative valences; so both ‘That damned kid really did well’ and ‘That damned cat
peed on my sofa’. Kapa follows pronouns, nouns and noun phrases, as in the
following examples:

Nímera expresses surprise that a situation has turned out contrary to one’s
expectations. It is a combination of the adverb, ni, which expresses a negative
state – the state of doing nothing or having nothing (see Section 3.4.1) – with the
suppositional particle mera (see above Section 7.6.2).
An example that senior speakers used to explain the particle is as follows:
You tell another person to complete some work and then you leave them, thinking
that the person will not do the work. When you return, you find that the person
actually has done the work, at which point you might say:
(7-47)ŋa ndɨ yu nímera kut
inda
1sg dm 2sg cs
be.r.sg.m.r dx.m
‘I thought you (m) just were here’ (doing nothing, but you weren’t, you
actually worked) (lit: ‘I was like, you just were here’)Another example is that people have come to your house and you expect them to
help you do some work, but they don’t. You might say:
(7-48) yum nímera a
-ku -nana
mbekem?
2pl cs
be.irr -irr intent come.2pl.r
‘So you’ve all come just to be here?’ (and do nothing even though I
expected you to work?)
A final example is that you are carving something and you want to make it look
like an object you have seen before – perhaps a small statue with a traditional
pattern. In the course of carving the piece, though, it ends up looking very different from what you expected. Nímera here expresses the surprise you feel at this:
(7-49) ŋa ndɨ nímera nirkrunana wákare ŋa ninukun
ŋa ndɨ nímera nir

‘I thought it would turn out differently than the way it turned out’ (lit. ‘I
intended to make it [one way], no, I made it [another way]’)8 Complex predicates
8.1 Complex predicates and complex clauses
In Tayap, the major division in complex structures is between combining verbs
versus combining clauses. Verb combining in Tayap is accomplished through
complex predicates, which can be serial verb constructions or complex predicates involving the verb ‘to be’. Clause combining is of three types: Coordinate,
subordinate and cosubordinate constructions.
This chapter deals with complex predicates, and the following chapter
(Chapter 9) deals with clause combining.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"Adverbial subordinate clauses259Examples are as follows:

‘when he said that bad thing to me, I (m) became ashamed’
When verbs in both subordinate and main clauses are constructed in the progressive (see Section 8.3.1) the meaning of -re is ‘while’ and the actions indicated by
the verbs occur simultaneously, not sequentially.

Negative conditionals occur paratactically without -re, perhaps because the
negation word wákare already ends in re:

‘If you (m or f) don’t listen to my talk, I (m) am going to hit you’9.4.2 Adverbial subordination with the hypothetical particles pi, pime,
ndɨ (hypo)
Counterfactual events are expressed by a main clause (‘I would have killed the
snake’) and a subordinate clause (‘if I had seen it in time’). As discussed in the following section, Section 9.4.3, counterfactual constructions, in addition to being
formed with a particular inflectional morphology, also obligatorily take a particle
that can be glossed as ‘hypothetical’.
This particle, which can be either pi, pime or ndɨ marks the clause in which it
appears as the subordinate clause. These particles all have their own stress.
Like the previous clauses, these clauses are semantically subordinate.
For example:
(9-19) a. pipiŋgabu aŋgwar pime, oŋgab wawarwekrɨknukun
pipiŋgabu a

Unlike the clause-linking constituents -a, -api and -re, the hypothetical particles
pi, pime and ndɨ are not bound morphemes. They are free morphemes that tend to
be clause final, as the following examples show:
(9-20) a. Mbanuŋ ewar awknet pi, wakŋgɨn

‘If you were young, I would marry you’When appearing with a verb inflected in the intentional mood (see Sections 5.4.2.3
and Section 7.4), pi (or ndɨ, which is also sometimes used in this context) means ‘If
X want(s) to do Y…’. For example:
(9-21) a. Kiki Potowre atɨkɨnana pi, namku wetak

Ndɨ behaves slightly differently to pi and pime. Ndɨ is also a discourse marker
that highlights the noun phrase that it follows in ongoing talk (see Section 3.11.2).
However, when it occurs in a clause with a verb inflected in counterfactual mood,
ndɨ conveys a hypothetical meaning.
Ndɨ is also the particle that usually follows the negation wákare in a negative
counterfactual sentence, for example:
(9-23) ewar tukur aiki wákare ndɨ yim patɨr andɨkrɨkkun
ewar
tukur ai

‘If it hadn’t rained yesterday, we would have roofed the house’9.4.3 Counterfactual (cf)
The counterfactual expresses an action or event that could have happened but
did not or cannot happen, as in ‘If he had gone hunting yesterday, he would have
speared a cassowary’, or ‘If you had been young, I would marry you’. Some of
the ways of constructing the counterfactual have become moribund in Tayap.
There are a number of morphologically rather complex subtypes. The counterfactual has the largest degree of variation documented for any verb form in Tayap.
Already in the 1980s, I was told by senior men that a clause like ‘would have
gone’ could be expressed as wakret, waknet, wakrɨknet or wakrɨkret, and that all
of those verbs meant exactly the same thing.
By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were constructing counterfactual sentences differently from what I had recorded in the 1980s. Those oldest speakersAdverbial subordinate clauses263were still able to produce counterfactual morphology, but they only inflected
one of the verbs in a counterfactual construction consisting of two clauses. Most
speakers under fifty, however, could not do even this. Those speakers constructed
counterfactual sentences without using any counterfactual morphology.
And even relatively fluent Tayap speakers younger than forty have stopped
using Tayap in the main clause of a counterfactual construction.
Senior men in the 1980s expressed the counterfactual as follows:
if-clause
verb inflected with counterfactual
morphology + hypothetical particle
pi, pime or ndɨthen-clause
verb inflected with counterfactual
morphologyExample:
(9-24) njenum Mbowdirekɨ muŋgit wakndak pi, ŋgɨ ŋgat non wakŋgro
njenum Mbowdi =rekɨ muŋgit wak1

3pl cassowary indef strike.cf -3sg.m.r.o
-3pl.r.s
‘If the dogs had gone with Mbowdi the other day, they would have speared
a cassowary’
By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were expressing counterfactuality by nominalizing the verb in the if-clause with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see Section 4.2):
if-clause
irr verb stem affixed with -ŋgar +
hypothetical particle pi, pime or ndɨthen-clause
verb inflected with counterfactual
morphologyExample:

"Cosubordinate constructions277in serial verb constructions formed with a non-final verb + a final verb like those
discussed in Section 8.2:
(9-38) a. ewar yimbar worerara wok
ewar
yimbar worer
-ara wok
yesterday canoe capsize.irr -mod go.3sg.f.r
‘yesterday the canoe tipped over’
b. ewar ŋgɨ yimbar worerkuwok
ewar
ŋgɨ yimbar worer
-ku
wok
yesterday 3pl canoe capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o- go.3sg.f.r
‘yesterday they tipped over the canoe’
(9-39) a. awin worerara wok
awin worer
-ara wok
water capsize.irr -mod go.3sg.f.r
‘the water spilled’
b. ŋayi awin worerkuwok
ŋa =yi
awin worer
-ku
1sg =erg water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o
‘I poured the water’wok
go.3sg.f.rNotice how the first sentences in these pairs (9-38a) and (9-39a) only has one argument – the subject, ‘canoe’ in (9-38a) and ‘water’ in (9-39a). The second sentences
have two arguments – subject (‘they’ and ‘I’) and object (‘canoe’ and ‘water’).
Negation on verbs marked with -ra is only marked on the independent verb
that carries TAM, but its scope is both/all verb stems. So the negation of a verb
like ‘jump’ is:
(9-40) ŋɨ
pɨŋ
-ra
atɨ
-kɨ
wákare
3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.irr -irr neg
‘he didn’t jump down’ or ‘he won’t jump down’9.8.2 Cosubordinate constructions with manner suffix -kar (mann)
Like clause chains constructed with -ra, those formed with -kar also add a morpheme directly onto the irrealis stem of a verb that precedes a verb of motion, thus
creating a medial verb. Unlike the -ra forms, however, constructions formed with
-kar or its allophonic variant -kwar (the environment triggering the alternation2789 Simple and complex sentencesis unknown) maintain the separate meanings of the modified verb and the verb
of motion that follows it. The suffix -kar creates a manner medial verb, one that
answers the question ‘How or in what manner did X go/come, etc.?’
Verbs constructed with -kar are constructed in the following way:
irr verb stem + -kar/-kwar + fully inflected verb of motion
Verbs formed with -kar encode the simultaneity of both actions for the duration
of both actions. In English, this temporal relationship would be rendered with the
adverbial ‘as’, as in ‘They were laughing as they washed the dishes’, or participle
clauses, as in ‘Laughing, they washed the dishes’. In other words, the first action,
laughing, occurred simultaneously with, and continued for the same length of
time as, the second action, washing the dishes.
This foregrounding of duration and simultaneity results in awkward literal
translations, as in the following example:
(9-41) nda mbɨd non
rekɨ ai
-kar
wek
dm pain indef with come.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘she came feeling pain as she came’
A more idiomatic translation would be with an English adverbial phrase; something that highlighted the experience of pain as during travel, like ‘In pain, she
made her way here’.
Cosubordinate constructions created with the -kar suffix also highlight an
action or process that has begun and is continuing, especially when the construction is used with an inanimate subject. In English, this kind of phrase
would use a verb of inception, like ‘begin’ or ‘start’, or a verb of intensification or process, like ‘growing’ or ‘becoming’; for example: ‘his anger was
growing’.
The verb of motion that follows the medial verb created with the -kar suffix is
most commonly either ‘go’ (okɨ) or ‘come’ (aiki), although any verb of motion may
occur in this slot. Examples are:
(9-42) a. ŋgu
warak
-kar
wek
3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘she came talking’
b. ŋɨ
ŋgar
-kwar mbot
3sg.m call_out.irr -mann go.sg.m.r
‘he called out as he went along’Cosubordinate constructions279The sense of development and process means that these verb forms can co-occur
with other chained forms, such as the -ra forms, for example:
(9-43) minjike =ŋa
mbatep pwak
-ra
o
-kar
wek
betel_nut =poss unit
drop.irr -mod go.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘the flowers on the betel nut (palm) are in the process of opening’
This suggests that the -ra clause and the -kar clause are syntactically equivalent,
both equally dependent on the final verb wek ‘come’.
The directionality of the verb of motion (‘go’ or ‘come’) can express a difference in meaning, as in the following:
(9-44) a. toto andɨ
-kar
wek
skin swell.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (in various places because bees have stung me)
b.toto andɨ
-kar
wok
skin swell.irr -mann go.3sg.f.r
‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (from a central point and spreading outwards)This kind of semantic difference encoded by different verbs of motion may have
been more productive in the past, and subtle nuances may have been eroded and
lost over the course of the last few decades. Today, senior speakers insist that with
only a few exceptions, such as (9-44a) and (9-44b) above, verbs formed with ‘go’
and ‘come’ have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.
Chains with -kar are negated by placing the negative marker after the independent verb. So the negated form of example (9-42a) is:
(9-45) ŋgu
warak
-kar
ai
-ki
wákare
3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.irr -irr neg
‘she was not talking as she came’
The scope of negation in manner constructions has to include the medial verb.
Thus, the negated sentence means that the woman probably still came (the sentence probably would not have been uttered if she hadn’t come); she just didn’t
come talking.
This seems to indicate that -kar (and in fact -ra) are complex verbal constructions rather than adverbials, since negation of adverbials would be
expressed with the negator directly after the adverbial, not as here at the end
of the clause.","[296, 297, 298, 299]"

Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separating the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
The fourth line is the translation into English.
An example is as follows:
(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
Merew -ŋgro =gi
munje par
-ŋgɨ
-ro
Sanae
-pl
=erg.pl man
bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’
Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlinear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below underneath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the language but there is no S in the gloss.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-202Conventions and abbreviationsXIXAnother convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object morpheme. An example is as follows:
(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
-ŋgɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o
‘she saw a snake’-n
-r.sIn this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
So in this grammar, the example above is written as:
(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s‘she saw a snake’-ŋgɨ
-n
<3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.sThe abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"2027 Mood7.1.2 Imperative
The imperative mood expresses a command that is directly addressed to one
person (‘you come!’) or to several people (‘you all come!’). In Tayap there are two
kinds of imperatives: positive imperatives – commands to do something – and
negative imperatives, commands to not do something.
Negative imperatives have a particular morphology and are discussed under
prohibitives and admonitives (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3).
Positive imperatives – a command that an addressee perform some action –
are realized differently for intransitive and transitive verbs.","[221, 222]"
"3.9.2 Information questions
Information questions are formed using one of the following interrogative words,
many of which are readily segmentable, e.g. anire ‘with whom’ can be segmented
as ani=re ‘who=com’; ani=yi is who=erg.f; ani=mat is who=poss, etc.:

Tayap speakers use a number of uninflected words to express emotional states,
affirmation or disagreement, as well as affective involvement with, or phatic
acknowledgement of, other people. These interjections form an utterance by
themselves:
ore‘Yes’. This is a Watam-language borrowing that has all but
replaced Tayap’s awo.awoThe Tayap word for the affirmative ‘Yes’. Since the 1980s,
however, it has become replaced by ore, and the meaning of
awo has shifted to express sarcastic agreement that would be
translated in English as ‘Yeah, right’ or ‘Like I’m so sure’.
The word has also taken on connotations of confrontation and
violence. It is shouted at others whom one is prepared to strike.
Parents use it frequently to threaten disobedient children, and
an adult engaged in a shouting match with another adult might
use it to signal that her or his patience is about to give in. When
it is shouted with sharp, rising volume and strong stress on the
final syllable awó, the word is a warning that means: ‘You haven’t
listened to my warnings and now I’m about to come and hit you!’wákare‘No’. This is also the morpheme of negation, often shortened to
wak when used to mean ‘No’ (as in: ‘Is there any food left?’ ‘No’).
When asked as a sharp question with rising intonation, wákare
signifies a threat, meaning: ‘So you’re not doing what I told you
to do? (I’m therefore going to come and hit you)’.ario‘He/she/it is coming to get you’. This word is used to scare
babies and small children. It is uttered preceded by the name of
the person or thing that the caregiver wants the child to think is
coming to get him or her, and is a vocative call, calling directly
to the person or thing to come and get the baby (in order to hit
the baby, or devour the baby).kapambínana ‘Exactly’, ‘Of course’Interjections and affect words99ŋguméŋgi‘That’s it’, ‘Exactly’yo‘Poor thing’. Always said in a soft voice with rising intonation,
with exaggeratedly extended vowel pronounced over the rise

she has died or left the village and gone away. Always said in a
soft voice with rising intonation. It frequently either precedes or
follows yo.aowoWord to convey longing and care for another, who is usually
absent. Always said in a soft voice with rising intonation.oiyo‘Poor me’. This is a kind of protest sound, usually growled in a
voice verging on tears. It is used frequently by children when
a caregiver insists they do something they don’t want to do, or
when another child won’t give the speaker something that she or
he claims is hers/his.ey‘Oh’, ‘That’s right’. Always said over two beats ‘e-y’ with rise-fall
intonation, often accompanied by raised eyebrows, which also
signifies agreement or affirmation.ai‘Hey!’wai‘Stop that!’tse‘You’ve got to be kidding!’akápore‘Oh my’, ‘How can this be?’akáiya‘Listen up’, ‘Hold on’, ‘Pay attention’yakáiya‘Oh my goodness!’. Said in response to a particularly salty joke,
clever riposte or outlandish threat. Said also if one sneezes
several times in a row – the sneezer says this him- or herself.numbwanrekɨ‘Watch out!’, ‘Be careful!’, ‘Think carefully!’ (lit. ‘with thought’)ayátaTwo different meanings:
(1) when shouted, it means: ‘Enough!’, ‘Stop it!’;
(2) when uttered in normal voice and said, for example, in
response to someone saying “Poor thing, I have no food to
give you”, it means: ‘Don’t worry about it’, ‘Don’t bother’.","[117, 118, 119]"
"2569 Simple and complex sentencesBut as (9-11c) shows, -a can also coordinate clauses that express a simultaneous rather than sequential relationship between the actions: Kama carried the
water and while she was carrying it, none of it spilled.
9.3.2 Coordination with -api ‘afterward’ (aft)
The suffix -api links clauses that encode actions that occur consecutively, one
after the other. It is affixed to a verb that is fully inflected for person, number and
TAM and takes its own arguments. The suffix marks that verb as an action that
was or will be completed before the action in the clause that follows it occurred
or will occur.
Like -a, -api can link clauses that involve either the same subject or different
subjects. Again, it joins full independent clauses.
Examples are:
(9-12) a. ŋa tuwkunetapi aikinet yure
ŋa tuw
-ku -net
-api
1sg wash.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr -aft

b. ŋgomiek
-api karep pwiek
fight.3pl.r -aft moon rise.3sg.f.r
‘after they fought, the moon rose’9.3.3 Coordination with ŋgɨ(na)napi ‘therefore’, ‘for that reason’
Some speakers pronounce this form ŋgu(na)napi, which indicates that it might be
analyzed as ŋgu (3sg.f)+ the coordinating suffix -api. So: ‘after it’.
Ŋgɨnanapi (or ŋgɨnapi) is a freestanding word. It introduces a clause that
expresses cause or reason, thereby combining two main clauses:
(9-13) a. ŋgɨgi Kama ŋgarkwanŋguk ŋgarkwanŋguk, ŋgɨnapi ŋgu wek

mind that’
Ayáta is a word most familiar to the villagers as an interjection of impatience or
dismissal, in its meaning of ‘Stop it! or ‘Never mind’ (see Section 3.10). It is this
latter sense of dismissal that is expressed when the word is used in a sentence as
a clause-coordinating conjunction.

scope covers both ‘go’ and ‘see’ verbs, which are both in their negative stripped
down form.

Sentences with ayáta can also occur in construction with the verb in the clause
that follows ayáta in the prohibitive mood. For example:

‘Even if night comes quickly, they’re going to come’9.4 Adverbial subordinate clauses
9.4.1 Adverbial subordination with -re ‘when’, ‘if’, ‘while’ (sub)
The suffix -re (realized as -de after n) attaches as a suffix to fully inflected verbs
and marks a verb as expressing the background condition in relation to which the
action indicated in the main clause occurs. This backgrounding nature of subordination is emphasized by the order of the subordinate and main clauses in
Tayap: the subordinate clause always precedes the main clause.
In English, these are clauses that would be expressed with the subordinating
conjunctions ‘if’ and ‘when’. Unlike English, though, Tayap makes no distinction between ‘if’ and ‘when’, at least when referring to unreal events; both are
expressed by -re.
These clauses are semantically subordinate in that they specify a precondition for the action of the main clause to occur. They are not considered medialfinal (cosubordinate) constructions, as the non-final verbs are structurally quite
different, for instance they are not obligatorily irrealis (Section 9.8).","[275, 276, 277, 278]"
"209to hit them’
ŋɨ
o-mbrɨ-net
3sg.m strike.irr-3pl.irr.o-1sg.m|
3sg.m.r.s
…he will hit them’The second way of formulating an indirect command involves inflecting both the
verb in the “tell” clause and the verb in the “command” clause in the subjunctive
mood. Contrast example (7-11a) above with the following:
(7-12) Kasek nam
-gɨ
o
-net
Kasek talk.sbj -3sg.m.r.o go.sbj -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘Tell Kasek to go’
Notice that the verb ‘talk/tell’ in the main clause of (7-12), has no subject morpheme. Comparing ‘tell’ in (7-11a) with ‘tell’ in (7-12), we see the following differences:
(7-13) full form
nam-tɨ-ŋgɨ-n
talk.sbj-s<3sg.m.r.o>2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘tell him’reduced form
nam-gɨ
talk.sbj-3sg.m.r.o
‘tell him’Not only does the reduced form in (7-13) take no subject morpheme; the object
morpheme suffixed to the verb stem is realized without prenasalization. This
means that what is normally realized as -ŋgɨ ‘3sg.m.r.o’ → -gɨ and what is normally realized as -mbɨ ‘3pl.r.o’ → -bɨ. All other object morphemes retain their
regular realis forms.
Now look at the verb in the subordinate clause in (7-12). This form – o-net – is
what is discussed above in Section 7.1 as the subjunctive form of a verb.
Indirect commands are normally introduced with a verb such as nam ‘talk/
tell’. So, again, to express an indirect command, one usually says either (7-14) or
(7-15):
imperative
future
(7-14) Kasek nam-tɨ-ŋgɨ-n
ŋɨ
ŋgo o-kɨ-net
Kasek talk.sbj-s<3sg.m.r.o>
3sg.m dm go.irr-irr-1sg.m|3sg.m.r
2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘tell Kasek to go’ (lit. ‘tell Kasek he will go’)2107 Moodreduced form
subjunctive
(7-15) Kasek nam-gɨ
o-net
Kasek talk.sbj-3sg.m.r.o go.sbj-1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘tell Kasek to go’ (lit. ‘tell Kasek that he go’)
However, indirect commands can also be formulated without an explicit introductory speech verb. In such cases, the indirect command is expressed in a way
that makes no explicit mention of who is responsible for carrying out the action.
An example of this was uttered during a discussion of the school in the neighboring village of Wongan that village children had gone to until March 2009,
when the teachers suddenly refused to work anymore. The speaker here means
that he wants other villagers to get rid of the striking teachers, whom he refers to
as ‘old’ and one of whom he calls by name (the name has been changed):
(7-16) Aŋgɨ rowesamb aŋgi taman wosmbɨ ondak. Nelson tɨ onet
Aŋgɨ rowe -samb aŋgɨ
taman wos
-mbɨ
dx.pl old

o
-ndak Nelson tɨ
o
-net
go.sbj -3pl.r Nelson too
go.sbj -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘[Tell] every one of those old teachers to piss off. [Tell] Nelson too to go’.
These could also be analyzed as jussives as described above without ŋganokaw,
thus “Let the teachers piss off. Let Nelson go too”.
Negative indirect commands, like ‘I didn’t tell Mbawi to go’, are formed by
negating the main verb (note that it is intransitive) and suffixing the verb in the
subordinate clause with the intentional suffix (see Section 7.4 for discussion of
how the intentional suffix is used):

The final use of the subjunctive in Tayap is in constructions in which a speaker
expresses a desire that some action be performed by someone else or something
else. Here the subjunctive occurs in the “desire” clause, after an expression of
cognition in the main clause. It is the appearance of the verb in its subjunctive
form that generates the meaning of the verb in the main clause as one of desire,
rather than cognition.

from elicitation sessions with senior men in the 1980s. I have not encountered
this construction in any of the conversations or speeches that I have transcribed.
Instead, desire predicates are constructed in one of two ways, none of them
involving the subjunctive.
The first way of forming a desire predicate is with the verb phrase ‘arei + ergative + tar’, which literally means ‘desire takes’. This is a moribund construction:
like examples (7-19a-b) above, my only recorded instances of it are in elicitation
sessions in the 1980s with senior informants.
The construction is realized without overt marking on the main clause, and
the verb in the subordinate clause is inflected for future tense:
(7-20) ŋɨ areiyi tatɨŋgɨn ŋa okɨnet Potowre
ŋɨ
arei
=yi

-tɨ

-net
Potow
=re
1sg go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.r Wongan =all
‘he wants me to go to Wongan’ (lit. ‘desire takes him, I will go to Wongan’)
The most common way to express the desire that someone or something else do
something that you want is to use the verb nam, which has the primary meaning
of ‘talk’ or ‘tell’, but which is also used to mean ‘think’ (this kind of semantic
conflation between verbs like “talk”, “tell”, “think” and “desire” is common in
Papuan languages; Reesink 1993).
Desire predicates with nam are constructed the same way as the example
above, that is to say with the verb in the subordinate clause inflected in the future
tense. Speakers also often use the adverb nande ‘thusly’ to draw attention to the
verb of desire, producing sentences like the following:
(7-21) ŋa nande namnet yu okɨtet Ombágire
ŋa nande nam -net
yu o
-kɨ

Ombági=re
Pankin=all
‘I want you to go to Pankin’ (lit. ‘I say/think thusly: you will go to Pankin’)Admonitive (adm)2137.2 Prohibitive (proh)
In contrast to the imperative mood, which expresses the speaker’s command for
the addressee to perform a particular action, the prohibitive is a command to not
perform an action. It can be translated as ‘Don’t do X’, ‘Don’t dare do X’ or ‘X is
prohibited’. The prohibitive cannot be negated. It is formed as follows:
person
ŋa ‘I’
yu ‘you’
ŋgu ‘she’

marked as ongoing, in the progressive aspect, so it means ‘Don’t be doing X!’

‘you can’t be here!’7.3 Admonitive (adm)
A structure that is morphologically almost identical to the prohibitive occurs in
the modal construction that expresses the non-desirability of an action.
This modality in Tayap has its exact equivalent in the Tok Pisin expression
“nogut X”, where X denotes an action that the speaker doesn’t want to happen,
regrets happening, is uncertain has happened or will happen, or when the speaker
anticipates or senses that something undesirable will ensue from the action’s
occurrence. This is a difficult expression to translate, because it can be a warning,
as in ‘X better not happen/have happened’; a negative hope, as in ‘I hope X doesn’t
happen’ (or, ‘I hoped X wouldn’t happen’); a concern, as in ‘May X not happen’; or
a meditation, like ‘What if X should happen?’. The admonitive cannot be negated.
In Tayap, this construction differs from the prohibitive only in that the final
-ke of the prohibitive markers is -ana in the admonitive, and that there is no benefactive in it:
person
ŋa ‘I’
yu ‘you’
ŋgu ‘she’

better not talk’; said to someone who
knows a secret about another person
and is going to visit that person; the
speaker is expressing the hope that
the person addressed won’t open his
or her mouth and spill the beans7.4 Intentional (intent)
The intentional mood expresses two kinds of events. The first is actions that are
or were intended or desired but that have not been completed or that didn’t occur
or won’t occur. The second kind of event expressed by the intentional mood is an
inevitable action: an action that often, in retrospect, ended in a foreseeable way.
An example of this latter sense is the response of a woman seeing a photograph I
had taken of a gravely ill Monei Mbanaŋ; he had been sick for weeks and I photographed
him as he was about to be carried to a canoe and taken to a hospital, where he died a
few days later. Upon seeing this photograph months after Monei had died, looking at
a desiccated and paralyzed Monei, this woman murmured waso-kɨ-nana (die.irr-irrintent) ‘he’s about to/intending to die’, in a soft, rising voice expressing sorrow.
The intentional mood was mentioned earlier in the section on the near future
tense (5.4.2.3) because it is constructed in a similar way, with the bound morpheme2167 Mood-ana (-nana after a vowel; this form is often reduced and realized as -na) affixed
directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive verbs) or directly to the irrealis
marker -ki-, -kɨ- or -ku- (for intransitive verbs). So the structure is as follows:
transitive verbsirr verb stem + irr object + -(n)anaintransitive verbsirr verb stem + irr morpheme + -(n)anaExamples of the intentional mood are:

The fact that a meaning of intention or desirability is foregrounded in this construction means that it can also be translated as ‘in order to’ or ‘with the intention
of’, as in the following, consisting of two juxtaposed main clauses:Benefactive (ben)(7-26)217a. ŋɨ mbet ŋa rarinana

expresses negative affect (7-28):

The formation and scope of the negative has been discussed in Section 5.2.

With transitive verbs, the irrealis subject suffix (Section 5.2.2) is added after
the irrealis object suffix.

It contrasts with the near future in terms of the action’s expected occurrence in relation to the moment of speaking: the near future is expected to occur soon in
relation to the moment of speaking; the future is expected to occur at some
other point in the future – a time that may or may not be specified by a temporal
adverb like ‘this evening’, ‘tomorrow’ or ‘later’.","[170, 171, 172, 173]"

the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counterfactual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the counterfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the following four ways:
awk-rɨk-rak
awk-rɨk-tak
awk-rak
awk-tak
Transitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:Adverbial subordinate clauses267+ object.r +

akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the counterfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the relevant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metathesis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).","[285, 286, 287]"

The lexical class of verbs is an open class which can be characterized as being
able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:

1sg=erg.f 2sg see.r -s <2sg.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
‘I saw you’
There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically threeplace predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:
(3-30) is
-iata
-n
give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
‘(you) give it to me!’
However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is transitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:
(3-31) epi
i
-kru
-net
tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’
Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):Verbs65(3-32) a. pokun

Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis category, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"

Bamboo shoots *cooking…eh…",[353]

A further type of clause combining construction in Tayap consists of medial verbs
appearing with modifying suffixes and then linked to independent final verbs,
which are always verbs of motion. These are cosubordinate constructions, also
called clause chaining constructions: the terms are used interchangeably here.
In these clauses, a medial verb appears in its irrealis or realis stem form,
without a subject marker, with an object marker if transitive, and one of three
linking suffixes: -ra (modifier), -kar (manner), or -rar (multiple), followed by an
independent verb. These structures form medial-final chains (Longacre 2007).
Van Valin and La Polla (1997) call this type of clause linkage cosubordination, i.e.
dependency without embedding.
Nothing can occur between the medial verb and the final verb. Also such
clauses cannot contain cataphoric pronominal reference (i.e. cannot refer forward
to something in a later clause). So medial chains are not subordinate, but neither
are they coordinate as their medial verbs are dependent on the final verb of the
chain for status marking.","[293, 294]"
"9.1 Simple sentences
A simple sentence in Tayap may consist of no more than an inflected verb. Thus,
a complex predicate like the serial verb construction discussed throughout the
previous chapter, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana ‘she intends to carry him down on her
shoulders’ is a fully formed sentence in Tayap. A simpler example is:
(9-1) puko
come_up.3pl.r
‘they came up’
Word order is relatively flexible, since the grammatical relations of core constituents and other elements are expressed through morphology and potentially
marked on NPs by case clitics like the ergative. However, Tayap is a verb-final
language and the unmarked order of elements in a declarative intransitive
sentence is Subject-Verb (SV), and in a declarative transitive sentence SubjectObject-Verb (AOV):
subject
verb
(9-2) a. prerikin
pipiek-ara

Sanae-pl=erg.pl man
bury.r-3sg.m.r.o-3pl.r.s
‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’
In transitive clauses that contain a subject, an object, and an oblique argument,
the order of object and oblique is fairly free, with the caveat that the object
never follows the verb, while the oblique argument can. Also, the subject normally occurs in the sentence-initial position. Some examples of various word
orders follow:

Verbless clauses also exist. The subject precedes the complement. For example:

‘It’s me’2529 Simple and complex sentences(9-6) omɨndeomɨnde yum=ke?

and cosubordinate clauses
Complex sentences consist of coordinate, cosubordinate or subordinate structures. The following suffixes and free morphemes function to express these
clause types.
Clause-coordinating suffixes (conjunctions):
Sections 9.3.1, 9.3.2-(y)a ‘and’
-api ‘then’, ‘afterwards’Clause-coordinating words:
Sections 9.3.3, 9.3.4ŋgɨ(na)napi

(see Section 9.10)hypothetical-ra ‘modifier’
-kar ‘manner’
-rar ‘multiplicative’Coordinated clauses2539.3 Coordinated clauses
9.3.1 Coordinated clauses with conjunctive –(y)a (‘and’)
The simplest way to link verbs in Tayap is to add a conjunctive morpheme -a (realized as -ya after a vowel) glossed as ‘and’ to fully inflected verbs that occur in a
series. Verbs linked in this manner express sequentiality: X happened, then Y
happened, then Z happened, and so on.
For example:
(9-8) a. Konjab adɨmbota sindineta turonɨ siniet
Konjab adɨmbot
-a
sindi -net
-a
Konjab trip.sg.m.r -and slip.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r -and
turo =nɨ
siniet
slope =loc go_down.sg.m.r
‘Konjab tripped, lost his footing and slid down the slope’
b. yu urekteta raretet!
yu urek
-tet
-a
rare
-tet
2sg turn.sbj -2sg.m.r -and look.sbj -2sg.m.r
‘turn around and look!’
All the clauses linked together in this way are independent clauses. For example:
(9-9)mbuspimbroya nda ŋgɨ prɨke
mbuspi -mb
-ro
-ya
nda ŋgɨ prɨke
send.r -3pl.r.o -3pl.r-s -and dm 3pl come_up.dl.r

wákare
-and come.irr -irr -and 1sg =all sell.irr -3sg.f.irr.o neg
‘he didn’t go and buy betel nut and come and sell it to me’
Note that in both examples in (9-10), even though the negating word wákare
appears only once, the scope of negation covers all verbs, and all verbs appear in
the irrealis form that they take when negated:
ai-ki
come.irr-irr
apu-kru
cook.irr-3sg.f.irr.o
o-kɨ
go.irr-irr
moser-kru
buy.irr-3sg.f.irr.owákare
negai-ki
come.irr-irr
mbudji-kru
sell.irr-3sg.f.irr.o
However, the scope of negation can also cover just the final independent clause:
see below, example (9-11c).
Note that these structures are considered to be series of independent coordinated clauses. It is possible to consider them as single complex predications,
particularly as the scope of negation can cover the whole coordinated series. But
an analysis of coordinated clauses is preferred here, since each of the verbs is
a fully inflected independent verb, which can take its own overt NP arguments
as individual clauses do, and which can stand on its own. In addition, there is
an overt linker joining the clauses, making an analysis of a single predicate less
viable (Haspelmath 2016: 296).
It is also possible to consider these sequences as medial-final chaining
(cosubordinate) constructions (Longacre 2007: 398). However, the non-final verbs
receive the full range of inflections, as do the final verbs. In medial-final chains
the non-final verbs are cosubordinate (see below, Section 9.8). For those reasons
it seems best to treat these sequences as independent coordinated clauses.
Coordinate clauses do not have to share subjects, and as examples (9-11c
and d) show, they can be independently negated:Coordinated clauses255(9-11) a. ŋgɨgi ŋa utawtioya ŋa katɨtet awinnɨ

All these examples contain separate clauses, each one headed by fully inflected
independent verbs. The first two examples express a sequential relationship
between the actions: they pushed me and then I fell (9-11a); the woman saw the
man, and then the two of them chased the pig, and then the man speared the
pig (9-11b). This relationship of sequentiality is the most common implication of
clauses joined with -a.","[270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"

Counterfactual morphology is still used in the example above, but unlike the
senior men in the 1980s, the oldest speakers of Tayap in 2009 only used it for the
verb of the then-clause. In this case, the counterfactual meaning of the if-clause
is borne by the hypothetical particle pi, pime or ndɨ, not by verb morphology.
Constructing a counterfactual sentence like this was a possibility earlier, and I
have a few recorded examples of this form from the 1980s. But they are rare. The
overwhelming majority of the examples I recorded in the 1980s inflected the verbs
in both the if-clause and the then-clause with the counterfactual morphology.
Counterfactual morphology is completely absent in the language of fluent
speakers between the ages of forty and fifty-five in 2009. They consistently
express counterfactuality without using any counterfactual morphology at all:
if-clause
irr verb stem affixed with -ŋgar for all subjects + hypothetical particle pi, pime or ndɨthen-clause
verb inflected in future tenseExample:
(9-26) ŋgɨgi Mbanaŋ rarŋgar pi, wemberŋgrɨndak

‘If they had seen Mbanaŋ, they would have chased him’ (lit. ‘Those
hypothetically who are see-ers of Mbanaŋ, they will chase him’)
This trend continues in the speech of speakers in their early forties and younger.
On the few occasions when these speakers formulate a counterfactual statement,
the entire then-clause is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap:if-clause
IRR verb stem affixed with -ŋgar for all
subjects + hypothetical particle pi, pime
or ndɨthen-clause

‘If I had been there myself, you would have gotten hurt in the morning’
(lit. ‘Me myself hypothetically present, you get big damage in the
morning’; i.e. I would have beaten you up)
It is possible that the counterfactual has been on its way out of Tayap for quite
some time. That, at any rate, may be one explanation for the fact that already in
the 1980s it exhibited the widest variation of any verbal morphology.
Another explanation could be that the various forms, even if they had the
same literal meaning, had different stylistic nuances. If so, those nuances had
already been lost even in the speech of senior men in the 1980s.","[283, 284, 285]"

A number of words and suffixes in Tayap have no referential meaning. They function to draw attention to or emphasize the word they follow. So an angry shout
of ayáta! ‘enough!’ followed by the word kai expresses stronger disapproval than
ayáta without the kai.
A second group of words function as ways for speakers to do things like plan
discourse, stress particular constituents, hedge and change topics.
Tayap’s intensifiers and discourse markers are as followsIntensifiers and discourse markers1013.11.1 Intensifiers
kai intensifier used only with the command ayáta ‘stop it’. Kai may be
a short form of kaitkait, which means ‘rotten shit’, and is used in

a belly filled up with feces because one has eaten so much. The speaker
here is chastising his relatives, saying that they eat well but never feed
him, and that such behavior must stop)

ndɨdiscourse marker that draws attention to the noun phrase that precedes
it. It conveys the gentle nuance that whatever precedes it is known
or should be known by the addressee. Its meaning therefore extends
from what one might translate as ‘you know’, ‘right’ or ‘so’, to more
exasperated nuances like ‘in case you weren’t paying attention’ or ‘you
perhaps don’t know, but now I’m telling you’. An example expressing
impatience is as follows:(3-98) tukur non

‘Come on rain, come!’-tak
-2sg.f.rAnother typical example that acknowledges previously conveyed information,
and that also might be interpreted as displaying some impatience, is the following:

When ndɨ occurs in a sentence that has at least one verb inflected in
the counterfactual mood, it also functions syntactically as a marker of
subordination (see Section 9.4.2).
ndadiscourse marker that is likely a reduced form of the deictic morpheme
ainda (see Section 3.8). Used like ndɨ to draw attention to the noun or noun
phrase that precedes it, and often carries a sense similar to English ‘then’:(3-100) mboka ŋa nda numbwan aproyi tatin

In a way that is similar to and probably related to the pragmatic function of
Tayap’s deictic words (see Section 3.8), discourse markers frequently occur multiple times in a single sentence, as in the following:

Note that ‘didn’t eat’ (i.e. an event that did not occur in the past) and ‘won’t eat’
(an action that will not occur in the future) are expressed with the same form, a,
in Tayap. This is the reason this form is classified as irrealis: both the future and
the negated forms of verbs are unreal events. The actions they express have either
not yet happened (the future) or they have not happened or will not happen (the
negated forms).
This invariant form of the verb stem in negation is a verb’s root form.
Note that the negator wákare usually appears clause finally (but see e.g.
examples (8-27d and 9.14b)). This feature of Tayap is common to many Papuan
and Austronesian languages (Reesink 2002b).","[159, 160]"
"Tense, aspect and mood in Tayap149If an action or event (a) has not occurred or won’t occur; (b) has not yet occurred
but may occur or is expected to occur, or (c) might have occurred but didn’t, Tayap
marks the following distinctions:Negative (neg)actions or events that have not occurred or will not occur;
e.g. ‘I didn’t spear the pig’, ‘He won’t go to Wongan’ (see
Section 5.2).","[168, 169]"
"1385 Basic verb morphologyIn intransitive verbs, TAM is marked on the verb root and the subject suffix,
when there is one. In certain situations, such as when an intransitive verb is
negated, subject suffixes disappear. Modality is marked by one of the three irrealis suffixes -kɨ, -ki or -ku (see Section 5.2.2).
Subject (S/A)
With the exception of negated verbs, verbs inflected with certain mood endings
(see Section 5.2 and chapter 7) and non-finite forms like participles (Section 4.2)
as well as verbs in certain modification constructions (Section 4.5.1 and 4.5.2),
every verb must be marked for subject (S/A).
Note that in this grammar, the subject suffixes in transitive sentences include
S in their gloss to clearly differentiate them from the object suffixes. The subject
suffixes in intransitive sentences do not include this S, since there is no possibility
of such confusion.
The forms of the subject suffixes are discussed in Section 5.3.2.
Object (O)
Transitivity in verbs is signaled by the presence of an object suffix that either
directly follows the verb stem, or, for certain verbs, that occurs between two discontinuous subject suffixes. Tayap has a number of distinct object suffixes that
signal person, number and TAM. These are discussed in Section 5.3.1.
Generally speaking, verbs are formed by suffixing TAM, object (for transitive
verbs) and subject morphemes onto verb stems. The system is complicated by
the fact that many verbs express TAM partly or wholly through suppletion. This
feature of Tayap grammar is illustrated in example (5-1). In that example, note
how the verb stem alternates between po, when it expresses an action that has
actually occurred, and o, when it expresses an event that has not yet happened.
As was mentioned above, main predicate verb stems never occur independently, and they never occur without being inflected for status (realis/irrealis). Despite this, though, it is easy to identify the root form of a verb. All one
has to know is the verb’s negated form. For this reason, let us examine verbs by
looking at negation first.","[157, 158]"
"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger villagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
His question was phrased as follows:
(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
who man
big
be.3sg.f.r
‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’
Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambiguously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):Nouns61(3-23) ŋgu munje ŋgo ŋgon pawrɨk tatukundre, nirkwanuk, noni namkru wákare

‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
nobody else is telling him to’
This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and disruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.
3.1.3.4 Gender in young people’s Tayap
Young speakers are aware that Tayap marks gender, and they know how to mark
it on verb stems, object suffixes, subject suffixes and through ergative markers.
A problem they have, though, is keeping straight the forms that mark masculine gender from the ones that mark feminine gender. This problem can be exemplified by a short extract from a narrative told by an eighteen-year-old woman.
This young woman is telling a story about a crocodile that she and some other
young women caught in the mangrove swamp. The women tied the 1.5 meter-long
crocodile’s jaws together, put it in a copra bag and brought it home. It lived for a
while, then, the speaker recounts, her father killed it (forms that express gender
are in bold):623 Word classes(3-24) orem aŋgi wuk embre sasŋi poŋgɨn

po
-ŋgɨ
-n
strike.r -3sg.m.r.o
-sg|1pl.s
‘the (female) crocodile was there, in the morning (male) father killed him’
All the words and morphemes that express gender are correctly formed. The masculine ergative case morpheme on ‘father’ is also the correct one. But note that
the grammatical gender of the crocodile here changes from feminine to masculine
in the course of a single utterance. Crocodiles are generally masculine in Tayap,
so the final verb here, poŋgɨn, is exactly what a fluent speaker would say. But the
deictic word used by this young speaker, aŋgi, as well as the first verb, wuk, are
semantically incorrect – they are the feminine forms, but what the speaker wants
are the masculine forms: ainde kut.
If the speaker had been talking about a female crocodile (for example if the
crocodile had been found to be carrying eggs), then the deictic aŋgi and the verb
wuk would have been correct. But in that case, the final verb should have had a feminine object morpheme – it should have been po-ku-n (kill.r-3sg.f.r.o-sg|1pl.s).
This kind of gender-mixing is characteristic of young speakers. Generally
speaking, the younger and less competent the speaker, the more gender will be
mixed in haphazard ways like this. As in many other areas of Tayap grammar, it
is clear that young speakers know that a particular distinction is expressed in the
vernacular. They are also capable of producing some of the forms that mark the
distinction. What they lack is the capacity to realize the distinction in a grammatically consistent manner.
In Young People’s Dyirbal, a situation of language death in Australia, weaker
speakers changed the semantic gender assignment system to a simple animacy/
gender system. That is, they kept the morphology and rearranged the class assignment system (Schmidt 1985). That is the opposite situation to what is happening
with Tayap: here, the assignment principles remain but what is changed is that
the morphological marking has become inconsistent.","[80, 81, 82]"
"8.2.1 Non-final verbs in serial verb constructions
Intransitive verbs used as non-final verbs take their irrealis stem (while not taking
an irrealis suffix -kɨ, -ki or -ku), and do not take any further marking. In the next
example, the non-final verb rar ‘see’ appears in its irrealis stem form, with no further
marking, and is immediately followed by the final verb of the serial verb construction. Note that in this example, together these two verbs form a complex predicate,
which is then marked with a conjunction ‘and’, forming a coordinated clause (see
Section 9.3):
(8-4) rarmboka tankun
rar
mbok
-a
see.irr go.1sg.f|1pl.r -and2328 Complex predicatesta
-n -ku
-n
see.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘… I was looking and I saw it ...’ (lit. ‘seeing go and seeing it…’)
On transitive verbs used as non-final verbs, again the irrealis stem is used, and
the object is marked using a realis form, regardless of the status marking on the
final verb to follow. For example (non-final verb in bold):
(8-5)manŋa ŋgwab nambar krarkuotike
man =ŋa
ŋgwab nambar krar
-ku
otike
cunt =poss hole
one
break.irr -3sg.f.r.o
fall.dl.r
‘the two of them broke open the same cunt hole and fell out’ (i.e. they are
brothers)Note that these non-final verbs are not truncated forms of full verbs. Compare the
form of the class 4 transitive verb ‘break’, in bold print in the following example
(this is a coordinated construction, see Section 9.3) with its non-final form above
in example (8-5):
(8-6) manŋa ŋgwab nambar kratukureya otike
man =ŋa
ŋgwab nambar
cunt =poss hole
one
kra
-tu -ku
-re
-ya
otike
break.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -dl.r.s -and fall.dl.r
‘the two of them broke open the same cunt hole and fell out’
Examples (8-5) and (8-6) have more or less the same meaning. But notice that the
only element that is the same in both verbs is the realis object suffix -ku. The stem
of the fully inflected verb (8-6) kra ‘break’ has a TAM-appropriate stem (in this
case, since it is expressing an event that occurred in the past, the stem appears
in its realis form).
The non-final forms in serial verb constructions (8-5) will always appear in irrealis form, and TAM will be carried by the verb that follows it. The final verb has the
full range of possibilities of any normal verb outside of serial verb constructions.
8.2.2 Non-final object morphemes (nfo)
The object suffixes that can affix to non-final verbs have two forms: they are either
the regular forms that occur on independent transitive verbs (see Section 5.3.1), orSerial verb constructions (svc)233they are drawn from a particular set of object forms that only occur on non-final
verbs. This set of non-final object suffixes is as follows; note that there is no distinction between dual and plural forms in this paradigm:
singulardual/plural-ai-am2-aw-am3sg.f
3sg.m-ak
-at-amb1Example:
(8-7) tandiwkɨ rarambotɨmbɨn
tandiw -kɨ
rar
-amb
o
-tɨ -mbɨ
-n
well
-emph look.irr -3pl.nfo shoot.sbj -s <3pl.r.o> -2sg3sg.f.r.s
‘aim well and shoot them!’
These non-final object morphemes are the functional equivalent of the object
suffixes used with the final verbs of serial verb constructions or indeed any verb
outside of serial verb constructions. They are also more or less interchangeable
with them. Looking again at example (8-7), above, it is possible to substitute
-amb (3pl.nfo) with -mbɨ (3pl.r.o), the regular object suffix used in independent verbs:
(8-8) tandiwkɨ rarmbɨotɨmbɨn
tandiw -kɨ
rar
-mbɨ
o
-tɨ- -mbɨ
-n!
well
-emph look.irr -3pl.r.o shoot.sbj -s- <3pl.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r. s
‘aim well and shoot them!’
It is not possible, however, to substitute -mbɨ with -amb in other clauses. There
are two main differences between the non-final and other forms of the object morphemes:
(1) Whenever one occurs, a non-final verb object suffix always occurs in the
first object position of a complex predicate. Another non-final object can
occur in the second or subsequent object slot, but a non-final object suffix
is blocked from appearing after an independent object morpheme has
occurred.
(2) Non-final object morphemes do not inflect for realis and irrealis. Unlike the
forms used with independent verbs – where -ku, for example, expresses
3sg.f.r.o and -kru expresses 3sg.f.irr.o – the non-final object forms always2348 Complex predicatesoccur in the forms listed above. Like the verbs to which they affix, which are
unaffixed for realis/irrealis status, the non-final object suffixes are unmarked
with regard to status.
It is not always clear how to determine which object morpheme – the non-final
verb object morpheme or the other form – will be used in any given instance.
So in tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana (repeated from (8-1)) notice that the non-final
object -at 3sg.m.nfo occurs after the first verb, and the form that occurs with
other verbs, -ŋgɨ 3sg.m.r.o occurs after the second non-final verb:
(8-9) tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana
tapr
carry_on_shoulders.irr-at
kɨ
-ŋgɨ
-3sg.m.nfo bring -3sg.m.r.oatɨ
-kɨ
tak
-ana
go_down.irr -irr 3sg.f.r -intent
‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’
The subject of a complex predicate like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is encoded on the
inflected final verb, and it is this final verb that would be negated to negate the
predicate. To see this clearly, below are examples of this same complex predicate
inflected for different subjects. Note the differences in the subject suffix (in bold)
just prior to the final intentional suffix – everything else in the verb remains the
same. Example (8-10d), repeated from (8-2), gives the negated verb, where, as
always, there is no subject marked.
(8-10) a. tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ -net
-ana

‘(any subject) won’t (or didn’t) carry him down on her shoulders’Serial verb constructions (svc)2358.2.3 Verbs that always or usually occur only in svcs
8.2.3.1 svcs with the grammaticalized verb kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
The verb stem kv only ever occurs as a non-final verb within a svc. It expresses
that an object will be brought to the deictic center or taken away from the deictic
center in a way that is specified by the verb of motion that follows it.
Tayap has a number of verbs that express different ways of carrying objects.
They include:
andruwe ‘carry on head’
erorar ‘carry on back’
ser-(p)-e ‘carry in hand’
tap ‘carry on shoulders’
wuw ‘carry on one shoulder’
Verbs like these express specific ways of carrying an object. The verb stem kv, on
the other hand, does not specify how an object is carried. It simply means ‘bring’
or ‘take’ in both the narrow sense of physically carrying something, and in the
more extended sense of, for instance, ‘bringing the visitors down (or taking them
down) to the end of the village to send them off’. Tayap speakers use the Tok Pisin
word “kisim” as a more or less exact equivalent.
Unlike all other verbs in the language, kv never functions as a final verb of a
serial verb construction, nor indeed any other verb type:
– it never occurs without another verb following it in a serial verb construction;
– it is not marked for tense;
– it does not take subject morphemes (although it does take object marking);
– and it cannot be independently negated.
Whenever it is used, kv must occur as part of a serial verb construction, in construction with other non-final verbs and/or fully inflected final verbs.
Kv ‘bring’ is one of the most commonly occurring verbs in Tayap, since
villagers are constantly telling children and others to bring them things (kv +
object morpheme + aiki ‘come’) or take things away (kv + object morpheme +
okɨ ‘go’).
Examples of its use are as follows (kv in bold):
(8-11)kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
a. ŋaŋan sapwar kukuwe!
ŋaŋan
sapwar ku
-ku
1sg.poss basket bring -3sg.f.r.o
‘bring my basket!’we
come.sbj2368 Complex predicatesb. Njime kɨŋgɨwe!
Njime kɨ

c. ŋaŋan sapwar kukuŋgwokara

sapwar ku
-ku
ŋgwok
-ara
1sg.poss basket take -3sg.f.r.o
go.3pl.r -perf
‘they took my basket’ (lit. ‘they left taking my basket’)
As the only obligatorily non-final verb in the language, it is likely that kv has been
grammaticalized from an earlier independent verb stem. Note that according
to Haspelmath (1995), constructions like those described here for Tayap with kv
should not be considered svcs since kv is not an independent verb. However, while
kv is indeed not an independent verb, it is useful to consider it with other verbs
functioning in svcs. It takes object marking like a normal verb; it also has verbal
semantics. Further, kv can form part of longer sequences of verbs in a complex
predicate, like in example (8-1) in which kv is the second of three predicates functioning together as a complex whole: here it is functionally identical to the other
non-final verb of the svc, clearly acting equivalently to other verbs in the language.
Alternatively, the morpheme kv could be thought of as a converb, or an auxiliary. However with a converb one would expect a situation of adverbial subordination (Haspelmath 2005: 3), and with an auxiliary one would expect tense,
aspectual, modal, voice or polarity semantics (Schachter and Shopen 2007: 41),
all of which are lacking here.
Kv could also be thought of as an incorporated adverb. The best analysis,
however, would seem to be to regard kv as a grammaticalized non-final verb.
8.2.3.2 Verbs which normally occur in svcs
With the exception of the grammaticalized verb kv (‘bring’, ‘take’), just discussed,
all Tayap verbs can be used independently, outside of serial verb constructions.
A number of verbs associated with motion, however, almost always appear as
non-final verbs in serial verb constructions.
The most commonly occurring verbs of this type are the following (all verbs
in the svc are in bold):

ŋgotɨtek ‘fell.3pl.r’). One reason may be that the speaker, who was shouting angrily in affect,
produced an ungrammatical utterance. Another reason may be that the verb ‘fall’, when it is
used as part of a svc, as it is here, has become a formulaic expression, and is realized as otɨtek
for all subjects, regardless of gender or number. In example (8-13), the plural meaning of the verb

it is a simple declarative sentence consisting of a transitive class 1 verb stem (po)
suffixed by a 3sg.f object morpheme denoting the pig (-ku) and a subject ending
(-n) denoting ‘he’, all inflected for realis.
The second example is marked. It contains the same verb stem inflected for
realis, but instead of the object morpheme that refers to the pig that was shot,
what follows is a morpheme that means ‘mine’, ‘the one belonging to me’ or ‘the
one whose being shot had consequences for me’. Morphemes that encode this
relation often also encode the notion of benefit, and in keeping with other linguistic work on Papuan languages (e.g. Foley 1991: 307–11), here they are labeled
“benefactive”, even if the label is not entirely satisfying, because the actions
encoded by the verb do not necessarily entail benefit. In (7-29a)–(7-29b) above, for
example, the spearing of my pig may be malefactive, and it may have happened
contrary to the speaker’s knowledge, will or desire.
The ben morphemes highlight a relationship of possession and/or the consequences that an action or event have on the person or thing denoted by the
morphemes. In (7-29a) and (7-29b) above, a relation of possession is expressedBenefactive (ben)219in both examples, by means of the possessive pronoun ŋaŋan ‘my’. But while
possession is evident in the first example, it is emphasized in the second, partly
through the possessive pronoun (which can be omitted in this construction) and
partly through the benefactive morphology affixed to the verb stem.
Benefactive morphemes often occur on a transitive verb like ‘give’. Here the
possessive meaning of ‘what belongs to me’ or ‘what should belong to me’ is
evident.

examples (7-31c and d; see Section 6.1.4)Although as already noted, the benefactive morphemes do not necessarily carry
a positive meaning of benefit (something that is apparent from examples (7-31c –
7-31d) about bone-breaking), they often do express the meaning of doing something for the benefit of someone, even though it is often difficult in practice to
separate the sense of beneficiary from that of possession.

One old woman once told a story of how she upbraided her teenage son for
taking money out of her net bag without her permission. “Yesterday you cried for
me to give you money”, she recounted herself saying, “and I gave you two kina to
buy biscuits, which you bought and ate”1.
After having established her prior generosity, the woman continued, saying
in a self-pitying voice:1 The kina, from the Tok Pisin word for ‘clam’, is Papua New Guinea’s main unit of currency.","[238, 239, 240]"
"2869 Simple and complex sentencesThe only kind of cosubordinate construction that young speakers do sometimes use is verbs formed with the medial manner suffix -kar. A small number of
verbs recur in the different narratives. These verbs always encode motion, never
process or development, and they are verbs that have probably been lexicalized,
like rar-kar mbot (‘I looked and came’), mar-kar ŋgwok (‘they rowed away’), and
amai-kwar wek (‘I was searching as I came’).
However, the -kar form remains productive for at least some speakers, who
produced verbs like the following:
(9-53) a. mɨri
adu
-kwar *weske
forest break.irr -mann come_outside.dl
‘the two of us came crashing out of the forest’; *weske has no meaning;
the speaker wants uske, from the verb root aski-.
b. naw
apu
-kwar ŋgwek
grassland burn.irr -mann come.3pl.r
‘they burned and came’; a morphologically correctly formed but
semantically incorrect verb – the speaker was talking about men
lighting fire to a grassland to drive game out towards men waiting
with spears, and she wants otar war-kwar ŋgwek: ‘fire light.irr-mann
come’; lit. ‘they lit fire while coming’.
c. ŋgat
sene am
-kwar ŋgwek
cassowary two fight.irr -mann come.3pl.r
‘the two cassowaries were fighting with one another as they came’;
the speaker wants the dual form of ‘come’, weke.
Even though each one of the examples in (9-53 a-c) contains a grammatical error
of one sort or another, they indicate that at least some young speakers can derive
medial verbs and form complex predicates with the -kar suffix.
A few speakers over-extend the subordinating suffix -re to coordinate clauses.
The following is an example of this, from a narrative told by an eighteen-year-old
woman (hesitations, false starts and interruptions by other speakers have been
edited out, and the name in the example has been changed):
(9-54) …yim taman sumbwanɨ katek. Sumbwanɨ katekre, ani, Sopak pemiekre

This speaker’s use of the clause subordinating morpheme -re (Section 9.4.1) is
morphologically correct – that is, it is placed correctly after the main verb in a
clause that thus becomes marked as subordinate. But it is semantically awkward.
A more fluent speaker would tell the story using the coordinating morpheme -a
(Section 9.3.1) in all instances where this speaker uses the subordinating morpheme. This particular speaker uses -re more than all other young speakers
combined. It seems that she has identified the morpheme as a synonym for the
coordinating suffix -a.
Three other kinds of clause linkage appear in young people’s narratives. The
first is the use of the perfect suffix to coordinate clauses, discussed in Section
5.4.3.2.
The second is linkage accomplished with the word ‘okay’, which has become
part of Tok Pisin (as “oke”) via English.
Here is an example from the narrative of a twenty-one-year-old man telling a
story about buying alcohol:
(9-55) piatana ŋa mbot ŋgɨrekɨ oke Jastinŋi botol nambar mosenkun oke Simbɨraŋi

‘…he gave me and I went with them, OK Jastin bought one bottle, OK
Sɨmbɨra bought one, OK I took mine and went with them to drink…’2889 Simple and complex sentencesNote that ‘okay’ here performs the role of both -a (which this speaker uses proficiently, as can be seen in lines 1 and 4 of this extract) and the clause coordinating
suffix -api, which links clauses that encode actions that occur one after the other
(Section 9.3.2).
The third way young villagers sometimes link clauses is with the Tayap word
mai, which means ‘enough’, and the discourse marker nda. For many young
speakers, these two words have replaced the -api suffix as a way of indicating
that one action was completed before the next action began.
This usage can be exemplified with an extract from a narrative told by a
nineteen-year-old woman:
(9-56) …ŋayi wakuna wakuna mai, nda sowor ninkun. Sowor nitukuna mai,

‘…I grated the coconut and, I grated it and enough, I made a boiling. She
made a boiling, enough, then mama made sago jelly then we ate it with
bamboo shoots’
There are several grammatical errors in this short extract: the class 2 transitive
verb war ‘grate’ is inflected in a way typical of young speakers (see Section 6.1.3).
The expression sowor ninkun doesn’t exist – the speaker wants a verb, soworpokun (‘I boiled a little’, from the verb root sowor-(p)-o ‘boil a small amount’).
And the speaker produces two different inflections for her *sowor construction:Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap289‘I did it’ (ninkun) and ‘she did it’ (nitukun), so it is never clear exactly who boiled
the small amount of bamboo shoots she talks about.
As far as syntax is concerned, note how the speaker uses mai (‘enough’) to
express the completion of one action before the following action begins, and how
the discourse marker nda marks the beginning of the following action. This is
precisely the kind of clause coordination done by the Tayap suffix -api, and in
the speech of a fluent speaker, the young woman’s sentence would look like this:
(9-57) ŋayi pap parkunapi, uret soworpokun
ŋa =yi

bamboo_shoot boil_small_amount.r -3sg.f.r.o
-sg|1pl.r.s
‘I grated the coconut, after I had grated it, I boiled a little bamboo shoots’
That the utterance that this young woman actually produces in (9-56) is so far
removed from correct Tayap – in terms of vocabulary, verb inflection and morphology – is sobering.
It is a chill reminder that a tenacious and unique little language spoken by
very few people for a very long time is now on its way to oblivion.","[305, 306, 307, 308, 309]"
"2829 Simple and complex sentences9.10 Complex constructions with the suffix signifying
multiplicity -rar (ml)
The final suffix occurring on complex sentences is -rar. This suffix signifies
that the action denoted by the verb occurred in relation to multiple objects – so
‘look at many things’ instead of just ‘look’, or ‘shoot at many things’ instead of
just ‘shoot’. The suffix -rar is always used on transitive verbs. The object morpheme is always in the realis form. TAM is marked on the final, independent
verb of motion that follows the medial verb. Even though the action of the verb
happens multiple times, the object is still singular. So the structure of this form
is as follows:
transitive verb stem irr + object r + -rar + verb of motion inflected for
subject, TAM and status
Examples are as follows:
(9-49) a. tar
-ku
-rar mbet
take.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml come.sg.m.r
‘he collected several as he came’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)
b. o
-ku
-rar mbot
shoot.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml go.sg.m.r
‘he shot various things as he went’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)
If the object slot is filled by a ben object rather than a direct object, then -rar is
realized as -tar (see examples 9-49c and d below):
transitive verb stem irr + ben object r + -tar + verb of motion inflected for
subject, TAM and status
c. kokɨr krar
-mba
-tar weke
head break.irr -3pl.ben.r.o -ml come.dl.r
‘the two of them cracked open all their heads’

mbɨd
3sg.m =erg.m woman 3sg.m.poss pain
i
-kwa
-tar mbet
give.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o -ml come.3sg.m.r
‘he beat up his wife’ (lit. ‘he gave his woman pain multiple times’)Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap283Verbs constructed with -rar are negated by negating the final, fully inflected verb
in the series. And like -kar verbs, the scope of negation covers the whole construction. So the negated form of (9-49a), above, is:
(9-50) tar
-ku
-rar ai-ki
wákare
take.irr -3sg.f.r.o
-ml come.irr-irr neg
‘he didn’t come collecting several’9.11 Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap
Young people use a great deal of tail-head linkage in their narratives. The narrator of Text 4, for example – a twenty-year-old man with good passive Tayap but
limited active command of the language – uses tail-head linkage in fifty percent of
his clause conjunctions. Compare this with between roughly ten to twelve percent
in Texts 1–3, which were narrated by more fluent speakers.
Subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are beyond the capability of most
Tayap speakers younger than thirty. A few of the most skilled passive active speakers (such as the twenty-five-year-old narrator of Tayap Text 3) can use the subordinating morpheme -re to produce ‘when’ clauses (see lines 26 and 51 in Tayap Text 3).
But hypothetical morphemes – like the counterfactual mood that often accompanies it – are mostly dead, and in fifty five of the fifty six narratives by young people
that I collected in Gapun, there is not a single instance of relativization.8
Young people’s narratives are strings of events presented paratactically –
X did Y, Z happened, Q did P. Sometimes, the events are narrated with no
clause-linking morphology, as in the following extract, from a narrative told
by a twenty-three-year-old man (hesitations, false starts and interruptions and
encouragements by another speaker have been edited out of this extract):8 The single exception is a complex narrative in flawless Tayap told by a twenty-nine-year-old
young woman named Mbonika Amburi (the same Mbonika who features as a six-year-old girl
in the opening vignette of Kulick 1992). Mbonika is the paradigm example of the passive active
speaker. She never speaks more than a few formulaic phrases of Tayap to anyone, and knowing
her well and seeing her every day, I had come to assume that her command of the vernacular was
minimal. After being astonished by the fluency of her Tayap narrative, I asked her why she never
spoke the language. She is ashamed, she told me. She feared that if she spoke Tayap and said
something wrong, the old people in the village would laugh at her. “They’ll criticize”, she told
me. “They’ll say, ‘You all speak Tok Pisin too much and so you don’t know the vernacular’. For
that reason, I’m ashamed to speak the vernacular” (“Ol bai wokim koments, ‘Tok Pisin i planti na
yupela i no save long tok ples’. Na olsem na mi save sem long tok ples.”)2849 Simple and complex sentences(9-51) …Yim kuk. Yim kuk, ŋa embre, ŋa mbot. Paita ŋɨ mbet. ŋa taina, yim

Leaving aside the morphological and TAM errors made by this speaker (all of
which are typical of the kinds of errors made by young speakers), note that he
does not use a single coordinating, cosubordinating or subordinating morpheme
throughout this entire stretch of speech. The verb phrases that make up the narrative are simply placed one after the other with no linkage between them. (The
final a of the nonce word taina could be a coordinating morpheme, but this is
hard to know since the word doesn’t mean anything.)
Much more commonly than simply listing verb phrases one after the other,
young speakers link clauses with the coordinating conjunction -(y)a. Here is an
extract from a narrative about a pig hunt by a twenty-six-year-old man who is one
of the more advanced younger speakers in the village:
(9-52)… Ŋa motɨnɨ warukpeta mbet. Mbeta mborma ndow tankuna anpekuna

1sg again turn_back.r -sg.m.r -and come. sg.m.r9 The correct form is either tanin ‘he saw me’ or tanŋgɨn ‘I saw him’.
10 The speaker wants a non-future verb here – nitukun ‘she made’. But even the progressive verb
he uses is incorrectly inflected. The form he wants is nirkwanuk ‘she was making’.","[301, 302, 303, 304]"
"Cosubordinate constructions275In all three types of clause chains, negation occurs once and has scope over
the whole construction.
Tayap cosubordinate constructions differ from serial verb constructions in
that medial verbs have an obligatory linking suffix, whereas non-final verbs in
serial verb constructions do not, and serial verb constructions generally form
a single phonological word whereas cosubordinate constructions do not (see
Section 8.2 for discussion of serial verb constructions).
One unusual facet of Tayap’s medial-final constructions is that they do not
typically form the long chains that Papuan languages in general are so famous
for. The majority of medial-final chains in Tayap consist of a single medial verb
followed by a final verb. This might be in part because the final verb has to be a
verb of motion.
An alternative analysis of these constructions, in particular -r and -kar, is that
they are adverbial suffixes, rendering an adverb from a verb. However a cosubordinate analysis is preferred here as negation operates across clause boundaries
to cover the whole construction rather than negating the putative adverb directly
(see below, Section 9.8.2).","[294, 295]"
"2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:
ŋayar=ke yu=yi
morasi apro Yengia=nɨ
ni-tu-ku-n?
true=q
2sg=erg.f deed
bad Yengia=loc do.r-s<3sg.f.r.o>2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘Is it true that you did something bad to Yengia?’Peripheral cases1214.4 Peripheral cases
Tayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole relationships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.

Z’graggen, John A. 10","[510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516]"
"Grammatical words generally coincide with phonological words in Tayap
(however see Section 8.2, example (8–3) for a counter-example). Grammatical
words consist of “a number of grammatical elements which (i) always occur
together rather than scattered throughout the clause (…); (ii) occur in fixed order;
and (iii) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning” (Aikhenvald 2007: 2).
In Tayap, verbs are grammatical words which minimally must always occur
with person and/or status marking except in certain restricted morphosyntactic environments. Even the longest and most complex of the complex predicates
described in Chapters 8 and 9 consist of single grammatical words, sharing as they
do various properties like marking for arguments and/or realis/irrealis status. Thus
the example discussed in detail in Chapter 8, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, ‘she intends to
carry him down on her shoulders’, is a single phonological and grammatical word.
However grammatical words do not necessarily have to be inflected. Verbs
are normally inflected, but nouns, pronouns, particles and other minor classes
can occur without inflection.",[64]
"2488 Complex predicatesWith transitive verbs, the habitual is formed as follows:
irrealis verb stem
+
benefactive object morpheme
in its progressive form (i.e. ending in n)
+
hab ‘be’, inflected for TAM, status and subject
+
verb ‘be’, inflected for TAM, status and subject
Examples:
(8-30) a. ŋɨŋi ndagro sisirkwanawkkut inde
ŋɨ
=ŋi
ndagro
sisir
-kwan
awk
3sg.m = erg.m palm leaf sew.irr -3sg.f.ben.o be.hab
kut
inde
be.sg.m.r dx.m
‘he is always sewing palm leaves’ (to make roofing shingles)
b. Oŋaraŋyi orákaŋgar apukwanawkuk
Oŋaraŋ =yi
orákaŋgar apu
-kwan
awk
Oŋaraŋ =erg.f food
cook.irr -3sg.f.ben.o be.hab
uk
be.3sg.f.r
‘Oŋaraŋ is always cooking food’
Besides ‘be’, only two other verbs in Tayap – ‘come’ and ‘go’ – have suppletive
habitual stem forms:
ai
come.irr
o
go.irr→
→aiak
come.hab
wak
go.habProgressives and habituals249These habitual stems combine directly with the habitual form of ‘be’, as follows:78
(8-31) a. aro sami yim wakawkkuk7 Potore
aro sami yim wak
awk
kuk
Potow =re
day many 1pl go.hab be.hab go.1sg.f|3sg.f|1pl.r Wongan =loc
‘we go to Wongan every day’
b. ŋgɨ arore arore ŋare sokoy aiakawkŋgwuk8 moserkrunana
ŋgɨ aro -re
aro -re
ŋa =re
sokoi
3pl day -adv day -adv 1sg =loc tobacco
aiak
awk
come.hab be.habŋgwuk
be.3pl.rmoser
-kru
-nana
buy.irr
-3sg.f.irr.o -intent
‘they come to me every day to buy tobacco’
Habituality can also be expressed not using a complex predicate like those discussed above, but by using an inflected form of the verb ‘to be’ as a simple predicate. Habitual verbs can express habituality in a variety of temporalities. It is
possible to say that an action will always be happening in the future, for example.
This is done by taking the habitual stem awk- and inflecting it for future tense. So
compare:
(8-32) a. a-ku-tak
b. awk-ku-tak
be.irr-irr-3sg.f.irr
be.hab-irr-3sg.f.irr
‘it will be’
‘it will habitually be’7 often shortened to wakuk
8 Often shortened to aiakŋguk9 Simple and complex sentences
This final chapter of the grammar describes simple and complex sentences,
tail-head linkage, and the way in which young speakers typically form complex
clauses.
Complex sentences are of three main types: coordinated clauses, cosubordinate clauses and subordinate clauses.
Coordinated clauses are independent clauses joined by various conjunctions.
Cosubordinate clauses themselves are of two types: modifying and manner
structures.
Subordinate clauses are also of three types: adverbial clauses (including
counterfactual clauses), relative clauses and perception constructions.
Tayap also has finite nominalizations, and these are discussed after the discussion of relative clauses.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"

‘He saw Akupi [’s spirit]’4.3.1.1 Ergative clitics on intransitive verbs
The main function of ergative clitics is to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
In Tayap, however, the ergative marker can also be attached to the subject of an
intransitive verb.
This marked use often carries a particular nuance, which can be illustrated
by an example taken from a narrative about a powerful crocodile water-spirit
named Ŋgayam. In telling this story, the narrator uses the ergative with an intransitive verb:
(4-35) Ŋgayamŋi mbet
Ŋgayam =ŋi
mbet
Ŋgayam =erg.m come.3sg.m.r
‘Ŋgayam came’1184 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThe ergative here carries the connotation of purposefulness. The implication
is that Ŋgayam didn’t just come – he came with a purpose, to do something, to
perform some kind of action. And indeed he did: the story tells of how Ŋgayam
flooded the rainforest and drowned an entire kin group as they stood gathering
his children – who had the form of fish – in his jungle streams. A version of this
story appears at the end of this grammar as Tayap Text 2.
Another telling instance of an ergative marker on an intransitive verb
occurred once when men from the neighboring village of Sanae arrived in
Gapun unannounced a few days after one of their relatives had been attacked
by a Gapuner. Everyone in Gapun was fearful of the Sanae men, because it was
assumed that they had come to fatally bewitch the attacker or one of his matrilineal relatives. As the Sanae men arrived in Gapun, villagers whispered to one
another:
(4-36) Merewŋgrogi ŋgwek
Merew -ŋgro =gi
ŋgwek
Sanae -pl
=erg.pl come.3pl.r
‘the Sanae [men] are coming’
The use of the ergative in this case meant that the Sanae men were not just dropping by Gapun on an innocent visit to socialize. They were coming to accomplish
a particular sinister purpose.
This use of the ergative to mark intentionality on intransitive verbs is also
apparent in cases where the ergative is used to denote a remarked-upon lack of
intentionality. The following example was uttered by a woman screaming abuse
at her relatives because her nephew littered the ground in front of her house with
seeds he blew from a homemade pea-shooter (i.e. in front of the house of the
woman having the “kros”, see Kulick 1992: 104–113 and Kulick 1993 for details on
these kinds of antagonistic speech events):

yum =ŋi
mburai
-ak
2pl =erg.m sweep.irr -link
‘you all never sweep!’aku
be.irrwákare
negHere the ergative clitic on an intransitive verb (mburai ‘sweep’) inflected in the
negative habitual aspect (see Section 8.3.2) highlights the consistent lack of
intention on the part of her addressees to perform an act that she thinks they
ought to consider doing occasionally.","[136, 137, 138]"
"1966 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs6.2.3 Intransitive verbs in young people’s Tayap
Intransitive verbs present young speakers with even greater problems than transitive verbs. The unpredictable nature of the subject endings, as well as many of
the stem changes between the irrealis and the realis forms, leave increased scope
for uncertainty and mistakes.
Many of the mistakes that young speakers make when inflecting intransitive
verbs are similar to the errors they make when they try to inflect transitive verbs.
Verb stem alternations are often disregarded, and young speakers inflect verbs by
mixing irrealis stems with realis subject endings. Examples are:
(6-41)a. *muŋg
-ot
stand.irr -sg.m.r
‘he stood’instead of
b. puŋg
-ot
stand.r -sg.m.r
‘he stood’
verb root muŋguku ‘stand’
(6-42) a. *rɨp
-tɨke
go_first.irr -dl.r
‘they two went first’
instead of
b. tɨp
-tɨke
go_first.r -dl.r
‘they two went first’
verb root rɨpkɨ ‘stand’
(6-43)a. *amb
-tak

‘she hid’instead ofIntransitive verbs in the realis197b. ombiek
hide.r.3sg.f.|1pl.r
‘she hid’
verb root ambuku ‘hide’
Looking at the verb stems in the (b) examples here and comparing them to
the forms that young speakers produce in the corresponding (a) examples, it
is clear that the young speakers have a strong sense of the root forms of the
verbs they want to inflect. Once again, though, they lack the ability to produce
the correct inflections. In many cases, the forms they produce are intelligible –
anyone hearing muŋgot or rɨptɨke in the context of a story would have little difficulty understanding it. Other verbs that undergo both stem changes and less
common inflectional forms, like ambuku ‘hide’, present greater challenges to
comprehension.
Example (6-43) above with ambuku ‘hide’ illustrates another feature of how
young speakers inflect intransitive verbs. Just as these speakers show a strong
tendency to collapse all classes of transitive verbs and inflect them as though they
were class 5 verbs, so do they tend, when they inflect intransitive verbs, to treat
them all as though they belonged to group I (see Section 6.2.1).
So an irregular verb like takɨ ‘sleep’ will be realized as tatet ‘you (m) slept’
instead of the correct tat, and a verb with a regular but non-transparent inflectional pattern like the one above, ombiek ‘she hid’, will be regularized to ambtak.
Group I intransitive verbs take subject endings that are the most common
ones for intransitive verbs. Three characteristics of the subject endings in
this group make them particularly salient for young speakers. The first is that
they are, precisely, the most common subject endings that affix to intransitive
verbs.
The second reason for their salience is the fact that they are identical in
form to the subject endings that affix to verbs in the future tense. So compare the
following:
PronounSubject endings for group I

intransitive and transitive) inflected

-nak
-nkem
-tuko/-ndak
-tike/-nkemThat these endings occur so frequently in Tayap makes them readily available for
young speakers to access when they are trying to conjugate a verb with the correct
subject ending.
The third reason why the subject endings listed above are particularly salient
for young speakers is because several of the forms are also identical to the imperative endings of intransitive verbs – even those verbs that have other subject
endings in the realis.
So in the imperative mood, even a verb as irregular as okɨ ‘go’ takes a regular
ending and becomes o-tet (‘go.sbj-2sg.m.r’) or o-tak (‘go.sbj-2sg.f.r’) or o-nkem
(‘go.sbj-2pl.r’).
Following this pattern, the imperative command telling a female to hide is
amb-tak (from the verb root ambuku). This is exactly the form that the speaker
who wanted to say ‘she hid’ produced in a narrative. The form is incorrect, but the
reason she chose it, and not some other form, is clear.
Intransitive verbs of motion present special problems for young speakers
of Tayap. A language like English uses a wide range of prepositions to encode
various kinds of motion. So English speakers say ‘go up’, ‘go down’, ‘go across’,
‘go around’, ‘go first’, ‘go inside’ and so on. Tayap has separate verbs for all of
those motions (and many more): wurkɨ ‘go up in a direction’, wuwku ‘ascend’, aski
‘go down in a direction’, sirki ‘descend’, utak-(p)-oski ‘go across’, rɨpɨkɨ ‘go first’,
arkɨ ‘go inside’. All those verbs either change their stem form – often dramatically – in the realis status and/or they have irregular and unpredictable inflections. An example is the common verb ‘go’, which has a stem form of okɨ in the
irrealis, but which in the realis becomes mbot ‘he goes’ (or ‘I (m) go’ or ‘you (m)
go’), wok ‘she goes’, ŋgwok ‘they go’, etc.
The unpredictability and irregularity of verbs of motion has resulted in their
becoming relatively scarce in the speech of speakers under thirty. The weakest
speakers get by with just two verbs of motion: okɨ ‘go’ and aiki ‘come’. The nature
of speakers’ narratives sometimes forces them to attempt other verbs, like sirki
‘descend’ (if the narrator has someone up a tree) or arkɨ ‘go inside’ (if the narratorIntransitive verbs in the realis199is talking about going inside a particular area of rainforest where a pig has been
speared or a venomous snake spotted). But young speakers’ attempts to inflect
those verbs are often either not correct or are arrived at only after discussion with
friends.
Even the common verbs ‘go’ and ‘come’ present many young speakers with
problems as soon as they have to inflect the verb for a person other than the singular ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘we’ (whose subject ending is always the same as the
1sg.f ending). The inflections for 2pl, 3pl and dual – all of which are quite different from the other subject endings – tend to be avoided, and when they do occur
they tend to be either wrong or the result of much back-and-forth negotiation
among the narrator and his or her friends.
The dual form, in particular, seems moribund. It should have occurred in
many of the narratives I collected, because many young people talked about how
they did something in the rainforest or the mangrove swamp together with one
close friend. The overwhelming tendency in those narratives, though, was to use
the 1pl ‘we’ form of the verb instead of the dual – so speakers said yim mbok ‘we
went’ or yim kuk ‘we were’, when what they wanted was yim woke ‘we two went’
and yim wuke ‘we two were’.
A final strong tendency in regards to intransitive verbs is phonological.
Young speakers frequently reduce the number of vowels that occur in a verb.
Particularly vulnerable is word medial ɨ, which often gets eliminated, and the
vowel cluster ie, which often gets reduced to e. So for example a verb with a vowel
cluster like tewtiek ‘she ran away’ becomes tewtek or tetwek. Priek ‘she went
down’ becomes prek, and so on.
This is a phonological process that probably has been going on in Tayap for
some time. In the 1980s, I recorded senior men who consistently said things like
katɨtɨtet ‘he fell’. In other words, their versions of these verbs had more wordmedial vowels than are present in the speech of even the oldest speakers today.
What seems to have happened in Tayap is that medial syllables have undergone
a steady process of reduction.

Mood is the name given to the ways a language grammatically encodes a speaker’s
attitude toward an utterance. How does a speaker issue a command or express a
wish? Voice a doubt or assert a fact? English accomplishes many of these kinds of
speech acts with modal verbs like ‘can’, ‘will’ and ‘must’. Tayap expresses them
with particular kinds of verbal morphology. The declarative or indicative mood
(i.e. making a statement) has been presented this grammar. It is not morphologically marked in Tayap. The interrogative mood is expressed with the interrogative
clitic =ke, discussed in Section 3.9.
Other moods that are indicated through particular morphology on a verb are
as follows:
– Subjunctive (including imperative, jussive, indirect commands and wishes)
(Section 7.1)
– Prohibitive (Section 7.2)
– Admonitive (Section 7.3)
– Intentional (Section 7.4)
– Benefactive (Section 7.5)
Other free-form mood particles are also discussed (Section 7.6).
Note that the realis/irrealis distinction which is fundamental to so much of
Tayap’s verbal morphology is considered in this work to be a status distinction
rather than a mood distinction, and as such is discussed in Chapters 5 and 6
rather than here. Note also that the realis/irrealis distinction is not available to
non-indicative moods apart from the benefactive.","[215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"
"2247 MoodBy 2009, awa was rarely heard in Tayap speech, and the instances of the word I
heard in the speech of senior villagers did not express overt disapproval. However,
they did seem to indicate that what was being referred to was anticipated or
overdue. So note the difference in meaning between two sentences, one of which
uses the simple interrogative, and the other which uses the modal particle awa:

unmarked.
In (4-19b), Sopak performs an action on an object. That object, like the subject
of the previous sentence, is unmarked. But Sopak receives the ergative clitic =yi,
which identifies her as the subject of the transitive clause.
The ergative clitics that attach to the subject NP of a transitive verb also
encode gender and number. The markers that occur on NPs are:
=ŋi
=yi
=gimasculine ergative
feminine ergative (becomes =i when it follows r, t, nd, w and
often k)
plural ergativeNote that as in all other areas of Tayap grammar, gender is not indicated in the
plural number, so a word like rorsem=gi (‘children=erg.pl’) can refer to either
male or female children.
These ergative clitics are also attached to the personal pronouns in a pattern
that maintains the plural meaning of =gi but not the gendered meaning of =ŋi
and =yi on 1sg and 2sg. In other words, gender is not marked in 1st and 2nd
persons.","[129, 130]"

negated. To see this, look at the full conjugation in the non-future and future

all this becomes okɨ wákare.
As in transitive verbs, the form of the verb that appears in negation is the verb
root.
An intransitive verb takes no object suffix. In negation, however, intransitive
verbs exhibit a morphological structure that parallels the transitive object suffix.
A negated intransitive verb signals irrealis status in both the verb stem and in the
suffix that follows it. This irrealis suffix suffixed to the verb stem further marks it as
irrealis.
The irrealis suffix suffixed to the verb stem is the same for all subjects, regardless of person, gender or number. Note that it occurs in contexts apart from just
negation, see for example (5-9a).
The suffix occurs in one of three forms: -ki, -kɨ or -ku. There is some phonetic
regularity in the patterning of which verb stems take which suffixes: verb stems
that contain or end in front vowels tend to take -ki or -kɨ, and verb stems thatStandard negation in transitive and intransitive verbs143contain or end in back vowels tend to take -ku. All the verbs that take -ki are verbs
of motion or end in the same stem form as the verb ai ‘come’. But like much else
in Tayap, none of this is entirely predictable. All verbs suffixed by irrealis -ki, for
example, may be verbs of motion or verbs that end with -ai. But not all verbs of
motion take -ki. And there are many exceptions to the front vowel/back vowel
pattern.

In the dictionary, intransitive verbs are listed with -ki/ -kɨ / -ku attached.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"Orthography452.8 Orthography
The Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equivalent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the following, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)462 Phonology and orthographyA sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthography were followed consistently.
This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about themselves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prenasalize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized wordinitially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceivably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,Orthography47their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spelling of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant percentage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the482 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two languages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"
"1.6 Tayap linguistic profile
Like many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most
elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively suppletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation
classes, both in terms of membership and formal marking. There are very many
suppletive stem forms marking a basic realis-irrealis distinction as well as various
other TAM categories. Person/number marking also differs depending on the verb
type. This is a language of “baroque accretions” (McWhorter 2001); or what Dahl
(2004) calls “mature phenomena”.
There is a fundamental distinction in verbal morphology between realis and
irrealis stems and suffixes, but this distinction is overridden by transitivity in the
prohibitive and counterfactual forms.
Grammatical relations are marked by verbal suffixes, which distinguish
S/A versus O. In some conjugations S/A is marked by discontinuous morphemes. Free pronouns and noun phrases mark the ergative case (A) compared
to unmarked forms for the absolutive (S/O). As in many Papuan languages
which have an ergative case, the ergative marker is optional and is frequently
omitted.
There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun
itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal
affixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns,
even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another
criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine;
short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. Again this type of genderassignment system is typical of the Sepik region.
Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural. Nouns
generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of
largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual.
These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full suppletion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the
oblique NP. Two adjectives also mark number, with partially suppletive forms for
singular, dual and plural. A further two adjectives have partially suppletive forms
for singular and plural.",[45]

‘after she talked to Akep, Mbopai left’The perfect is not used in either of these two sentences. The sentences do not foreground the completedness of the action of talking; they foreground the temporal
relationship between the actions expressed in the clauses. They mark the subordinate clause (‘after she talked’) as the background or condition for the main
clause (‘she left’).
Here is how a nineteen-year-old speaker of Tayap formulated (5-17):
(5-18) Akepre waraktakara, ŋgu wok
Akep =re
warak -tak
-ara
ŋgu
wok
Akep =loc talk.r -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -perf 3sg.f go.3sg.f.r
‘she finished talking to Akep, she left’
In this speaker’s Tayap, what should be the coordinating suffix -api is instead
realized as the perfect suffix -ara. That such a substitution can occur is partly
because the younger speaker calques on Tok Pisin while speaking Tayap.
In Tok Pisin, the word “pinis”, which derives from English ‘finish’, is both
an aspect marker and a clause-coordinating adverbial. As a marker of aspect, it
follows a verb to indicate completed action. So compare:1585 Basic verb morphology(5-19) mi go
‘I am going’ or ‘I went’
ol i toktok
‘they talk’ or ‘they talked’vs.mi go pinis
‘I have gone’vs.ol i toktok pinis
‘they’ve finished talking’As a clause-coordinating conjunction, “pinis” forms an utterance in itself and is
said with rising intonation:(5-20) Mipela toktok igo igo.
Pinis,
mipela i go nambaut
we
talk
duration ‘finished’ we
go around
‘we spoke for a while and when we were finished talking, we went our
separate ways’
Young speakers of Tayap model their use of the perfect on these dual functions
of Tok Pisin’s “pinis” and they use the perfect suffix to signify both a completed
action and clause coordination. They even pronounce verbs onto which they have
suffixed the perfect suffix as they would the Tok Pisin equivalent with “pinis”, i.e.
they use the same rising intonation that they use when speaking Tok Pisin.","[177, 178]"
"7.1.2.1 Intransitive imperatives
The imperative forms of intransitive verbs are the single most salient grammatical feature of Tayap, both for the speakers of Tayap and for everyone else in the
lower Sepik area who has ever heard of the language. Whenever Tayap speakers talk about their vernacular, they merrily tell anyone who is willing to listen
that Tayap “is broken into a woman’s language and a man’s language” (“i bruk
long tok ples bilong ol meri na tok ples bilong ol man”). If you want to talk to a
woman, they explain patiently, you have to use the “women’s language” (“tok
ples bilong ol meri”). If you want to talk to a man, you have to use the “tok ples
bilong ol man”.
Anyone who has followed this grammar this far knows that Tayap does indeed
have a number of gender-specific forms, such as the difference in first-person
forms for intransitive verbs inflected in the non-future tense (a male says ŋa mbot
‘I went’; a female says ŋa mbok; see Section 6.2). But this particular gendered
distinction is not primarily what the villagers have in mind when they talk about
how their language is broken in two.
Instead, the villagers who describe Tayap in that way are referring to a single
feature of grammar, namely the different forms that the imperative of an intransitive verb takes when it is addressed to a woman or to a man. The dramatic way
villagers describe this feature of their grammar, however – that you have to speak
to men and women using their specific “languages” – makes it seem as though
the entire Tayap language is “broken” in two.
The villagers’ exegesis carries the unspoken implication that even parts of
speech like nouns have female and male forms, and that both those forms must
be mastered in order to be able to talk at all. Non-Gapuners who listen to Gapun
villagers describe Tayap in this way always react with understandable dismay,
and they inevitably shake their heads in wonder that a human language could
possibly be so complex. Some of them then go off and augment the complexitySubjunctive (sbj)203further, informing others that, in fact, Tayap is “broken” into four languages: one
for women, one for men, one for girls and one for boys.
Gapuners’ story about Tayap’s difference from other vernacular languages
must have arisen because no other language in the area marks gender on the
imperative forms of intransitive verbs. This is a salient feature of language
because whenever villagers from different places meet, one way many of them
enjoy spending time is to quiz one another on what one calls common objects –
‘betel nut’, ‘lime’ (for chewing betel nut), ‘tobacco’, ‘pig’, ‘dog’ and ‘sago jelly’
are the inevitable ones – in their respective vernaculars.
Once these words have been exchanged, many people then go on to ask
about simple verbs: “How do you tell someone to come?”, they ask each other;
“How do you say ‘go’?”. Anyone asking a Tayap speaker that question will
receive the spiel about the vernacular being “broken in two” in response, and
so the story about the bizarreness of the little language that really is two – or is
it four? – separate languages gets perpetuated and spread throughout the lower
Sepik area.
Despite the hype, however, the imperative form of an intransitive verb is
a simple construction. All it involves is (a) a verb stem inflected to express a
speaker’s wish that another person do something – in other words, a verb stem
inflected in the subjunctive mood – and (b) a subject ending that marks gender
and number. So the imperative for any intransitive verb is formed in the following
way (recall that 2nd person dual uses the plural form; see the discussion that
precedes example (3-73)):subjunctive verb stem+
+
+-tet (2sg.m.r)
-tak (2sg.f.r)
-nkem (2pl.r|dl)The subjunctive stem of a verb is almost always the same as the form that verb
takes in the irrealis status. Examples are:
(7-2) a. male
addresseeb. female
addresseepruk-tet
muŋgo-tet
o-tet

addressees go.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all go!’muŋgo-nkem
stand.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all stand!’pruk-nkem
work.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all work!’In all the examples above, the stem form of the verb in the subjunctive is identical to the stem form of those verbs in the irrealis status. There are exceptions to
this pattern (for intransitive verbs; transitive verbs have exceptions discussed in
7.1.2.2), however, such as the following, where the verbs have a subjunctive-specific form:
(7-3) a. ai (irr) ‘come’ → we- (sbj, so: we-tet, we-tak, we-nkem; see example
7-1 above)
b. tutu (irr) ‘sit’ → tuto- (sbj, so: tuto-tet, tuto-tak, tuto-nkem)
Verb roots ending in r gain the vowel e before the imperative ending, which is
also stressed:
(7-4) a. rar (irr) ‘ look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
b. sir (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)
If these exceptions only occurred in the imperative mood, it would be possible to
simply classify them as exceptions and maintain that the stem form of an imperative verb is its irrealis form. However, the stem forms of verbs in the imperative mood are also the forms that occur for verbs inflected to express an indirect
command (see below 7.1.4). This fact indicates that the underlying form for imperative forms is a subjunctive wish – in other words, ‘You go!’ takes the grammatical
form of ‘(I want that) you go!’.
For that reason, the stem forms of verbs inflected in the imperative are classified as subjunctive rather than irrealis, even though their realization in speech is
most often identical with the irrealis forms.","[222, 223, 224]"
"340Tayap-English-Tok Pisin DictionaryThe form of the verb stem that appears in negation is also the form that
constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example,
ir-kɨ-ndak ‘laugh.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will laugh], and ir-ŋgarana ‘laugh.
irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not laugh].
(2) The forms in the parentheses following the entry are the verb’s realis forms.
If the forms are regular, only a few will be listed, in order to allow a reader
to identify them by looking at Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Grammar. In the
case of ‘laugh’, a glance at Section 6.2.1 reveals that the endings -ot and -ok
indicate that ‘laugh’ is a Group IV intransitive verb, and that pirot means ‘I
(m) laughed’, ‘you (m) laughed’, or ‘he laughed’; pirok means ‘I (f) laughed’,
‘you (f) laughed’, ‘she laughed’ or ’we laughed’. The forms that verbs that
belong to this Group take for all other persons are found in that Section.
If the intransitive verb is irregular in realis, the irregular forms will be listed in the
parentheses following the entry.
Another example of an entry for an intransitive verb, this time for one whose
stem form does not change between realis and irrealis, is ‘say’, ‘talk’. The entry
for this verb looks like this:
namkɨ v.i. (-net/-nak), say, talk; tok.
This entry should be read to mean the following:
(1) The irrealis form of this intransitive verb is namkɨ, consisting of the verb
stem nam + the irrealis suffix -kɨ. This is the form the verb takes when it is
negated – so one says namkɨ wákare ‘X (any subject) didn’t/won’t talk’.
Once again, the irrealis suffix -kɨ is a morpheme separate from the verb
stem, but it is provided in the dictionary entry because there is no way of
knowing what the suffix is unless one sees it here.
The form of the verb stem that appears under negation is also the
form that constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example, nam-kɨ-ndak ‘talk.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will talk], and
nam-ŋg rana ‘talk.irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not talk].
(2) In those cases where all that follows an entry for an intransitive verb is
parentheses with endings like (-net/-nak), this means that the verb stem
remains the same between realis and irrealis. The realis person-endings of
these verbs can be reckoned through the following steps:
(a) remove the irrealis suffix -ki, -kɨ or -ku (in the case of ‘say’ or ’talk’, it is
-kɨ). This leaves only the verb stem (nam);
(b) suffix the appropriate subject endings to that stem.","[359, 360]"
"Serial verb constructions (svc)231is permeable, and can be interrupted by question morphemes and even separate
words, as in the following:
(8-3) kopi tarak masinnɨ ŋgakrawokwankuk
kopi
tar
-ak
masin=nɨ
coffee (TP) take.irr -3sg.f.nfo machine (TP)=loc
ŋgakrawo -kwan
kuk
shell.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o be.sg.f|1pl.r
‘we used to take the coffee to a machine and shell it’
In this situation the form is no longer a single phonological word but still a single
predicate.
Serial verb constructions are composed of one or more non-final verb(s) and
a final verb. The non-final verbs are always formally irrealis, but the final verb can
take the full range of Tayap’s TAM inflections. TAM and subject marking occurs
once across the construction, on the final verb, and the non-final verb(s) are
marked only for their object, if transitive.
According to Haspelmath (2016: 296), a serial verb construction is “a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element
linking them and with no predicate-argument relation between the verbs”. It is
important to make clear that non-final and final verbs are both independent, and
there is not a relationship of syntactic dependency between the verbs of a serial
verb construction. Instead, there is a sharing of features (TAM, subject marking
and negation). The differences between non-final and final verbs are positional, a
factor of where they fall in the clause, rather than related to dependency.","[250, 251]"
"5 Basic verb morphology
5.1 General properties of Tayap verbs
In Tayap a single complex predicate can express the equivalent of an entire
sentence in English. This is most apparent in its serial verb constructions,
which can express a complex action like ‘she intends to carry him down on
her shoulders’ in a single predicate (tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana). Serial verb constructions like this are discussed in Chapter 8. For basic sentence structure, see
Section 9.1.
Transitivity, TAM (tense, aspect and mood) and realis/irrealis status are morphologically encoded in verbs by suffixes, with the object suffix preceding the
subject suffix.
In transitive verbs, this occurs in the following manner:
(5-1) a. poŋgro
po
verb stem ‘strike’
in realis-ŋg
-object/undergoer ‘him’
in realis-ro
-subject/actor ‘they’
in realis-ŋgrɨ
-object/undergoer ‘him’
in irrealis-ndak
-subject/actor ‘they’
in irrealis‘they hit him’
b. oŋgrɨndak
o
verb stem ‘strike’
in irrealis
‘they will hit him’
Intransitive verbs, too, signal both subject and status, but many of them tend to
do so in a more fusional manner than is the case for transitive verbs, especially in
the non-future tense (which expresses events or actions that are occurring in the
present or that have occurred in the past).
An example of intransitive verbs is the verb poror ‘sing’. Some of the forms
that this verb takes in the non-future and the future tenses are as follows:
(5-2) a. poror-net
sing.r-1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘I (m) sang’ or ‘he sang’https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-005poror-nak
sing.r-1sg.f|1pl.r

sing.irr-irr-1sg.f|
1pl.irrporor-kɨ-ndak
sing.irr-irr-3pl.irr‘I (f) will sing’ or ‘we
will be’‘they will sing’Verbs in Tayap are constructed around verb stems, which never occur alone
(except in certain modification constructions, see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2), and
which also never occur without being marked for status, either realis or irrealis
(although some verbs, e.g. poror above have the same stem for both). The root
forms of these stems – that is, the forms that are available for derivational processes like nominalization, and the citation forms that are entered in the dictionary as the lexical entry for a verb – are the irrealis forms of the stem.
A note is in order on the terms “roots” and “stems” as they are used here.
Roots are the lexical parts of a word, the unanalyzable part left once the
affixes are all taken off. Stems are involved when inflectional affixes apply to
different forms of a root (Aikhenvald 2007: 38–40). So Tayap verb roots have
inflectional stems: that is, for instance, there are separate inflectional stems
for realis and irrealis. In this grammar, “stem” refers to the inflectional possibilities of a verb root, and “root” designates the basic underlying lexical part
of the verb.
Verbs in Tayap have the following structure:
V – O – (A)
V – (S)
Note that verbal morphology, unlike clausal relations, follows a nominativeaccusative alignment system.
Verbs in Tayap mark the following elements:
Status
Has the action of the verb happened or is happening? Has it not happened?
Tense, aspect and mood (TAM)
Is the action described by the verb occurring now? Is it completed? Has it happened or will it happen? Did it not happen? Temporal and modal relations like
these must be marked on the verb.
In transitive verbs, TAM is marked on the verb root, the object suffix and, if
there is one, on the subject suffix as well.","[155, 156, 157]"

kina there; they are three kina that are there specifically for her benefit and use.

occur in the expected object slot in a verb’s architecture, thus precluding the
appearance of the object marker. Note that a coreferential NP can appear with
the object marker: see for example (7-37a) below. And like the other object morphemes that have been discussed and exemplified throughout this grammar, the
benefactive object morphemes are marked as either realis or irrealis.
The forms of the benefactive object marker can be compared to those of the

Tayap also has four freestanding particles – awa, mera, kapa and nímera – that
express expectation, supposition and surprise. Two of these particles – awa and
mera – occur with both verbs and other parts of speech. Kapa modifies only
nouns and adjectives and nímera occurs with only verbs.","[240, 241, 242, 243]"

A third set of related deictic words are demonstrative identifiers, which indicate
particularity and presence, e.g. ‘it’s me’, or ‘I’m here’ (as opposed to being away
somewhere). The term “demonstrative identifiers” comes from Diessel (1999).
These words function in a similar way to how an adverb like ecco functions in the
Italian eccomi – ‘it’s me’ or ‘here I am’. So the most common response to a question like ‘Who are you?’ – asked, for example when one hears someone approaching in the pitch blackness of a moonless night – is Ŋa ainda (‘it’s me’).

Finally, in addition to all the deictic forms listed above, Tayap also has a
quasi-deictic suffix -me, which means ‘yes, indeed, that one (or those) as opposed
to any other or others’, occurring on pronouns.
-me is also used to emphasize a referent, for example:

The suffix -me occurs just prior to the deictic aŋgi in one of the most frequently
heard phrases in Tayap: ŋguméŋgi. This phrase – a contracted form of ŋgu-me aŋgi
(3sg.f-me + aŋgi) – means ‘yes, that way’, ‘that’s right’ (“em nau” in Tok Pisin).","[114, 115, 116]"

The difference in meaning between these two forms is subtle. Speakers say that
the fully inflected forms – those in (9-36a) and (9-37a) above – are synonymous
with the -ra forms – those in (9-36b) and (9-37b). Some verbs – ‘jump’ for example –
regularly occur in both forms. At the same time, however, it is clear that the
morpheme -ra does not just link two verbs in a temporal sequence like the conjunction –(y)a does (Section 9.3.1). Instead, -ra modifies both the verb to which it
affixes and the verb of motion that follows it, creating a new lexical predicate out
of two independent verbs.
In an important sense, all complex predicates create new lexical verbs by
linking together a series of different verbs. But the difference in this case is this:
other kinds of sequences in Tayap create complex predicates by conjoining verbs
that retain their separate lexical meaning even as they link together in sequences
with other verbs. Their meaning is additive – each verb contributes its particular
meaning to the final compound construction. So a sequence like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana (Section 8.1ff) that was discussed in the previous chapter is composed of separate constituents that each add their own meaning to the action being expressed,
resulting in a verb that means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’.
Complex clauses created with the -ra suffix, on the other hand, are not additive, they are transformative. A complex clause created with -ra is not so much the
sum of its parts as it is a new semantic entity. Although many verbs formed with -ra
do retain a transparent relation to the independent verbs that derive them, others
have meanings that are completely different from the two verbs that compose
them. So ‘faint’, for example, is wasowra aiki- (wasow ‘die’ + -ra + aiki ‘come’).7
Another way in which the -ra suffix transforms verbs is that it reduces their
valency. Compare the verb worer ‘capsize’ in constructions formed with -ra, and
7 This suffix occurs on at least one noun: the way to express that a body part has ‘fallen asleep’,
as one says in English, is to use the derived verb sɨwɨdɨdɨmra okɨ, which comes from the word for
small black ants; so sɨwɨdɨdɨm ‘ants’ + -ra + okɨ ‘go’.","[295, 296]"
"Most of these kin terms, and certainly their dual and plural forms, are moribund. Several of them – oiŋga ‘daughter-in-law, woman speaking’, njanimb
‘great-grandchild’, ombre ‘father-in-law, male speaking’, otre ‘mother-in-law,
male speaking’ – were produced only after several conversations among Gapun’s
oldest Tayap speakers. There is disagreement about whether one of them – eŋki,
‘husband of maternal aunt, male speaking’ – is even a Tayap word. Several people
suggested that it might be a borrowing from the Adjora language spoken in theNouns53nearby village, Sanae. However, since old men in the 1980s told me it was, and
since it has a Tayap plural, I include it here.
Villagers under forty all know common words like munje ‘man’, noŋor ‘woman’
and ror ‘child’, and they know their plural forms, but most do not know their dual
forms. Most kin terms have been either forgotten or replaced with words from Tok
Pisin. So oyeŋg ‘in-law’ has been replaced by Tok Pisin’s “tambu”, neni ‘grandfather’ has been replaced with “apa man”, and keke ‘grandmother’ with “apa meri”.
Words like mambrag ‘spirit of a dead person’ and kandap ‘forest being’ are kept
alive by mothers who use them to frighten their small children, so everyone knows
them. The plural forms, however, are not known by speakers under thirty-five.
The two non-human nouns that have plural forms are:
SingularPluraldognjenjenumpigmbormboreirum3.1.2 The animacy/genericness distinction in nouns
The animate-inanimate/generic distinction is fundamental in Tayap, and is
marked by two kinds of morphemes that are attached to nouns.
The first are peripheral case clitics, that denote relations like location or
dative (see Section 4.4). Several of these clitics have different forms for animate
and inanimate/generic referents. Note, for example, the different clitics that
express movement towards something or someone – an animate referent takes
=re and an inanimate referent takes =nɨ (see Section 4.4 for the complexities of
the animate/inanimate division):
(3-12) a. ŋgu

3.1.2.1 Animacy/genericness marked through possessive morphemes
Animacy/genericness is also marked on NPs by the enclitics that signal possession
(see Section 4.5 for discussion of possession). The possessive clitics express animacy/543 Word classesgenericness and number. They have optional consonant-final forms: The conditioning factors between the vowel-final and consonant-final forms are unknown.animate
inanimate/genericsingularplural=ma(t)

‘pig’s tail’
b. Sopak =mat sapwar
Sopak =poss basket

c. mɨri

rainforest =poss pig
‘wild pig’ – as opposed to a numŋa mbor, a domestic pig, of the village
d. num
sami =mat morasi
village many =poss custom
‘the custom of many villages’
The possessive clitics attach to the last word of the noun phrase expressing the possessor. The order between possessor and possessed is free, so both Sopak=ma(t)
sapwar (Sopak’s basket) and sapwar Sopak=ma(t) (basket Sopak’s), or mɨri=ŋa
mbor (forest’s pig) and mbor mɨri=ŋa (pig forest’s) are possible. Placing the np +
poss constituent last emphasizes it.
For animate plurals, the possessive clitic is =mandama(t). For example:
(3-14) a. Potow
=mandamat morasi
Wongan =poss.pl
behavior
‘the behavior of the Wongan people’
b. mbor rorsem =mandama tawk
pig
child.pl =poss.pl
plate
‘the baby pigs’ plate’ (that they eat from)
When speaking in general terms, =ŋa(n) is used even with animate nouns. For

3.1.3 Gender in nouns
Gender is a ubiquitous feature of Tayap. A common category in Papuan languages
in general (Foley 2000: 371), in particular in non-Trans New Guinea languages
(Ger Reesink pers. comm.), the pervasiveness of gender in Tayap, and the way it is
marked across the grammar, differentiates it from the languages that surround it
and gives it a reputation in the area as being a “hard” language.
Non-speakers of Tayap perceive the prominent role that gender marking
plays in Tayap because they hear speakers telling one another to do things, and
the imperative forms of intransitive verbs are inflected according to the gender
(and number) of the addressee(s).
So – to use the example that Gapun villagers themselves inevitably cite
whenever they explain the nature of Tayap to anyone – when you talk to a man563 Word classesyou say wetet (come), and when you talk to a woman you say wetak (come), using
gender-marked verbal affixes.
This feature of the language never ceases to astonish any Sepik villager who
hears it, and people from other villages who listen to Gapuners explain that they
have “two languages” invariably react as though such a language is so bizarre as
to stretch the bounds of credulity (see Section 7.1.2; see also Sections 3.5 and 5.3
for gender marking on pronouns and verbal affixes).
3.1.3.1 Gender marking
Gender in Tayap is a property of nouns, but is a morphologically covert category.
It is not marked not on the noun itself, but is expressed on the following targets:
(1) deixis markers (see Section 3.8); and/or
(2) ergative markers on the subjects of transitive verbs (see Section 4.3); and/or
(3) suffixes on the verb that encode subject and object (See Sections 3.5 and 5.3);
and/or
(4) suppletive verb stems (see Chapter 6)
For example, compare the following intransitive constructions:
(3-16) a. noŋor aŋgi patɨrnɨ wuk
noŋor
aŋgi patɨr =nɨ
wuk
woman dx.f house =loc be.3sg.f.r
‘the woman is in the house’
b. munje ainde patɨrnɨ kut
munje ainde patɨr =nɨ
kut
man
dx.m house =loc be.sg.m.r
‘the man is in the house’
Here, the gender of the subjects is expressed by both the deictic words (aŋgi/
ainde) and the gender of the inflected verb aku ‘be’ (wuk ‘she is’ versus kut
‘he is’).
Transitive verbs mark gender in object suffixes (see Section 3.5). Some classes
of transitive verbs (classes 4 and 5) signal gender and number on the subject suffix(es) as well. So compare the following non-future forms of the class 4 verb ŋgar
‘call out to’:
(3-17) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgu ŋganukun
ŋɨ=ŋi
ŋgu
ŋga
-nu -ku
-n
3sg.m=erg.m 3sg.f call_out.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘he called out to her’Nouns57b. ŋguyi ŋgu ŋgatukun
ŋgu
=yi
ŋgu
ŋga
-tu -ku
-n
3sg.f =erg.f 3sg.f call_out.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘she called out to her’
In both examples, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object (a masculine
object would be -ŋgɨ; see Section 5.3.1). But in a class 4 verb like ŋgar, the gender
and number of the subject is also obligatorily marked: in this example, gender is
encoded in the alternation between -nu + -n (combining to signal 1sg or 3sg.m or
1pl), and -tu + -n (combining to signal 2sg or 3sg.f).
Notice also the different ergative markers affixed to 3sg.m (=ŋi) and 3sg.f (=yi).
Other verbs (conjugation class 3 transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs)
also change their stem forms to signal the gender of the subject:
(3-18) a. mbori pap okun
mbor=i
pap
o
-ku
-n
pig=erg.f coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o> -3sg.f.r.s
‘the (female) pig ate coconut’
b. mborŋi pap kakun
mbor =ŋi
pap
ka
-ku
pig
=erg.m coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o>
-n
-1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘the (male) pig ate coconut’
Here, again, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object, ‘coconut’, and thus
remains the same in both sentences. But the verb ‘consume’ (a) is a conjugation
class 3 transitive verb, and in those verbs, the verb stem changes to signal the gender
(and number) of the subject, alternating between o and ka (see Section 6.1.4).
This verb-stem alternation is a source of serious difficulty for young speakers
of Tayap, as is discussed in Section 6.1.5.","[72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine referents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a
two-way distinction:

further from speakeraŋge(de)
aŋgɨ(de)‘these’, ‘here’
‘those’, ‘there’Note that the three-way distance distinction in the singular and two-way in the
plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other pragmatic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
FeminineMasculinePluralaŋgok…aŋgo
‘this... here’
aŋgudek…aŋgu
‘that…there’aindet….ende ‘this …here’
anɨndet…ende/inde/ide/de
‘that…there’
6aŋgeb…aŋge
‘these…there’
aŋgɨb… aŋgɨb ‘those…
there’The first or second words in these pairs can occur alone functioning as an argument of a verb phrase. During a disagreement between two men, for example, one
protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6
(3-84) aindetŋike oyin?
aindet
=ŋi
=ke o
-yi
-n?
that_one =erg.m =q strike.irr -1sg.irr.o -sg|1pl.irr.s
‘that one there is going to hit me?’
These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in
response to a question like ‘Who did it?’:5 We thank Anna Margetts for this observation.
6 The second word here, ende, can also be realized as inde, ide or de
7 It is possible that these instances might more felicitously be labeled “focusing”, “highlighting” or “emphasizing” rather than topicalizing (Reesink 2014). More information and analysis
on the functions of all these deicitics is needed.","[113, 114]"

The ergative is frequently used when the arguments of a verb are both animate,
and both present in the clause. In those instances, ergative marking is used to
clearly distinguish the subject of a transitive verb from its object.
For example, the following sentence is ambiguous:
(4-29) ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn
ŋɨ
ŋgat
po
-ŋgɨ
-n
3sg.m cassowary strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
‘he speared the cassowary’ or ‘the cassowary stabbed him’ (with its claws)
Speakers would normally interpret the fact that the pronoun ‘he’ occurs in the
sentence-initial position as indicating that ‘he’, and not ‘the cassowary’, is the
agent in this sentence. But without ergative marking the phrase is ambiguous,
and older fluent speakers say that it is poor Tayap.
The reasons for the ambiguity are:
(a) the class 1 transitive verb o means ‘strike’ or ‘shoot’, and here it could mean
either ‘penetrate or pierce with a spear’ or ‘penetrate or pierce with a sharp
claw’; and
(b) cassowaries are typically gendered masculine, so the 3sg.m object suffix on
the verb can refer to either a male person or a cassowary.",[135]

in Gapun were ready to fight men from the neighboring village of Sanae. All prepared to fight, the Gapun men could ask one another in anticipatory excitement:
(7-40) awa ŋgɨ ai
-ki
-ndak?
exp 3pl come.irr -irr -3pl.irr
‘Will they come?’; i.e. ‘Do you think they’ll really come?’Mood particles225When it occurs together with a negated verb, the sense of expectation is heightened. Contrast the following two sentences:
(7-41)a. awa mbet
exp come.r.1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘he should come’ (i.e. ‘I expect he will come’)
a. awa ai-ki
wákare
exp come.irr-irr neg
‘he must have arrived’Because it carries a sense of expectation, this construction is similar in meaning
to the admonitive mood discussed in Section 7.3. For example, the following two
sentences both mean something similar:
(7-42)a. awa Kemma orasambgi nirru wákare
awa Kem =ma
ora
samb =gi
exp Kem =poss thing pl
=erg.pl
nir
-ru
wákare
make.irr -2sg.irr.o neg
‘it must be Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the spirit world]
that are making you sick’ (in Tok Pisin: “Nogut ol samting bilong Kem
i mekim yu”)
b. Kemma orasambgi nirŋgarana
Kem =ma
ora
samb =gi
nir
-ŋgarana
Kem =poss thing pl
=erg.pl make.irr -adm.sg|1pl
‘it wouldn’t be good if it’s Kem’s things [i.e. his connections with the
spirit world] that are making you sick’ (same Tok Pisin translation as
above).22 This example is marked by non-agreement between the plural noun (orasamb, ‘things’) and
the plural ergative morpheme (=gi) affixed to the noun, and the singular inflection (-ŋgarana) on
the verb ‘make’ (nir). One would expect the plural ending –ŋgroana ( so ‘nirŋgroana’ see Section
7.3).
It is probable that this example takes the form it does because the plural noun orak samb
(‘things’) is usually treated as a singular entity. So speakers say:
ŋgan orasamb wuk aŋgi
ŋganoraksambwukaŋgi3pl.possthingplbe.3sg.f.rdx‘their things are there’ (lit. ‘their things is there’)2267 MoodAlthough they clearly are not identical in meaning, sentences like these two both
express an anxiety in relation to, or an expectation about, an event.","[244, 245, 246]"
