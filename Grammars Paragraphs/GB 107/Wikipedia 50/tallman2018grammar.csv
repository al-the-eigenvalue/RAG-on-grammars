of perspectival semantics includes grammatical categories of modality, evidentiality and
mirativity. Chácobo contains morphemes that encode the following modal category;
conditionality, counterfactuality, prediction, intention volition, assertion, epistemic
modality. Within the category of epistemic modality morphemes encode different degrees
and shades of certainty, necessity and possibility. Chácobo only has one truly evidential
category in the sense of a category that encodes information source; the reportative. There
is no dedicated marker of visual evidentiality in Chácobo, although a common strategy for
encoding visual information is to use the assertive =rá which encodes that the speaker has
epistemic authority. Chácobo has one mirative morpheme that encodes that the situation
described by the speaker runs counter to expectations. The language has grammaticalized
two categories that relate to the speaker’s emotional perspective; the regretative and the
anxietive. These could be considered modal because they evoke alternative realities (e.g.
Timberlake 2007: 315).
Finally there are a number of semantic distinctions that are diachronically and/or
synchronically built out of the negation morpheme in Chácobo. For instance, the
conjectural seems to combine negative with interrogation. I dedicate a section to discussing
the negative and all modal categories that seem to be built out of the negation marker and
something else. The markers of perspectival semantics are summarized in Table 13.1.
1004Some of the categories that are relevant for modality, evidentiality, and mirativity in
Chácobo are discussed in other sections. For instance in Chapter 4, I discussed whether the
reportative should be considered a clause-type along-side the declarative, interrogative and
imperative (Section 13.16). This Chapter will provide a more detailed description of the
semantics of this morpheme, rather than the extent to which it patterns morphosyntactically
with other clause-type/rank morphemes. The semantics of the remote future is already
described in Chapter 10 (Section 10.6). In this Chapter I will only describe its interaction
with other modal categories in conditional clauses.","[1046, 1047, 1048]"

AntiM also applies at the boundary between stem-stem combinations. However,

the same with respect to the application of AntiM. AntiM applies obligatorily if H2 is29 Originally, I thought that multiple high tone reduction was a result of a constraint such that prosodic words
only contained one high tone (Tallman 2013, 2014). However, this is false as is demonstrated by the examples
in (6.50) where two high tones surface in the stem. Furthermore, the concept of a prosodic word used in my
previous descriptions of the prosodic system was stipulatory and not motivated based on the

Perhaps the clearest case of an anticausative reading is found in (8.48). This

essentially falling to pieces because of overuse. He makes reference to the fore-end (a part
of the rifle that is used to hold it steady), saying that this part did not break off. To express
this he combines the verb stem tsok-a ‘pull something out’ with the passive -ʔaká.

is referring to the gradual wear of the rifle itself.","[676, 677]"

"As is typical of demonstrative noun-combinations cross-linguistically (Matthews
2007; Croft 2001), the criteria of headedness do not clearly point to one or the other element
being the head in the tóa hóni ‘that man’ construct. First, according to the criterion of
endocentricity, neither tóa ‘that’ nor hóni ‘man’ is the head or dependent. Either tóa ‘that’
can be dropped leaving hóni ‘man‘ by itself as a referential expression or hóni can be
110dropped leaving tóa as the sole referential expression. Subcategorization does not discern
between these cases, either; all demonstratives can combine with all noun roots. I will refer
to the relationship between tóa and hóni in examples such as (3.2) as one of co-dependence.
Because constructs vary in terms of how well the criteria of headedness converge, I will
assume that the syntactic relations between elements across constructs in Chácobo vary on
a scale from symmetrical (co-dependent) to asymmetrical (head-dependent) based on the
criteria.
Complexes will be named after the syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective) of
their head (see §3.3 for a definition and justification of syntactic categories). For instance,
I will refer to the combination of the noun honi ‘man’ with the adjective siri ‘old’ as a noun
complex. I will refer to the combination of the verb tsaya ‘see’ with its dependents as a
verb complex. This means that the entire sentence in (3.2) is a verb complex in this
grammar. While all verb complexes are sentences, not all sentences are verb complexes.
For instance non-verbal predicate constructions (see Chapter 4 for the distinction between
verbal and non-verbal predicate constructions) can be sentences without being verb
complexes.
In cases where the relation between the elements of a construct is not asymmetric,
I will refer to the the complex by the name of the open class lexical category in the complex
(a description of lexical classes is provided in Section 3.3 below). For instance, the
combination of tsaya ‘see’ and =kɨ ‘declarative, past’ in (3.1) will be referred to as part of
the verb complex, because tsaya ‘see’ is a member of an open class of lexical verb roots
111and =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’ is not. In (3.2), the combination of toa ‘that’ and honi
‘man’ will be referred to as a noun complex. The reason for this is that honi ‘man’ is a
member of an open class of lexical noun roots while toa is not part of an open lexical class
of morphemes. The principle that a complex is named after the open class lexical root is a
rhetorical convention. The reader should not attach any theoretical or descriptive
significance to this terminological move. For instance, I could call toa honi ‘that man’ a
demonstrative (or determiner) complex and it would not affect the structural analysis of
noun/determiner/demonstrative complexes provided in this grammar3.2. MORPHOTACTIC VARIABLESThis section is concerned with how the syntagmatic organization of morphemes, constructs
and complexes are described in this grammar. By syntagmatic organization, I refer to the
order of elements in a sequence and to their relative contiguity. Contiguity refers to the
degree to which two or more elements must occur together or conversely the degree to
which to or more elements can be separated by other elements (Croft 2001).
The study of the syntagmatic organization of elements in a grammar can be divided
into morphotactics and syntax. The distinction between morphotactics and syntax is usually
described as follows. Morphotactics refers to the distribution and organization of
morphemes in a word. Syntax refers to the distribution and organization of words in a
sentence (e.g. Hockett 1956; Anderson 2015a). The distinction is motivated as long as one
112can discover general organizational principles that distinguish morphotactics from
syntax.10 Otherwise the distinction amounts to an orthographic convention and should have
no place in a descriptive grammar.
At the same time, it is commonly implied or more simply stated, that there is a
continuum between morphotactics and syntax (e.g. Meira 1999: 122; Fleck 2003: 227;
Valle 2017: 241). A similar claim that seems to express the same basic idea is that the
precise division between morphological combination (suffixes) and syntactic combination
(clitics, particles, words) is arbitrary (e.g. Epps 2008: 125), even if there are general
architectural differences between the structure of words and phrases.
In this grammar I assume that the question of whether a language has two systems
of syntagmatic organization (even if they overlap or display fuzziness at their boundaries)
is an empirical question that should be assessed for each language (Haspelmath 2011;
Tallman & Epps forthcoming). I, therefore, take it as the null hypothesis that any
architectural division between morphotactics and syntax in a language is arbitrary, unless
the distinction can be motivated empirically.
It is against this background that I define the terms morphotactics and syntax as
opposing ends of a continuum of bondedness rather than terms that identify different10 An example of such an organizational principle comes from Quechua. In Quechua, in syntax the language
has an subject-object-verb order. Inside the verbal word, the order it verb-object-subject, where the object
and subject are expressed by suffixes. Thus, the order of the expression of grammatical relations is reversed
(Weber 1980).","[153, 154, 155, 156]"

nominalized verbs and adjectives, I interpret the -ma in the lamentative i-auxiliary
construction as a nominalizer. Since nominalization is a form of subordination it is on this
basis that I classify the lamentative construction as an auxiliary construction.
The third construction is the (im)possibilative mɨtsa(ma)-auxiliary verb
construction (see Section 13.7). In this construction the lexical verb takes the
purposive/nominalizing clitic =tí. The (im)possibilative morpheme mɨtsa(ma) never occurs
with clause-type/rank morphemes. Rather it occurs as the predicate inside a non-verbal
predicate construction. In the sentence in (4.72), the subject of the non-verbal predicate is
the first person singular ɨ-a ‘first person singular’. The non-verbal predicate declarative
morpheme ʂo encodes that the clause is declarative. The morpheme mɨtsa(ma) is the head
of the predicate, and the lexical verb ka-nia ‘shoot in the back’ is the lexical verb
subordinated under the nominalizer =tí.","[259, 260]"

The data gathered thus far do not provide a clear answer as to whether the
reportatives in Chácobo should be analyzed as modal or illocutionary operators. For none
of the reportatives do the results line up precisely around a modal or illocutionary analysis.
For instance, according to the test of assent/dissent and the direct contradiction cancellation
test, the reportatives are modal operators across the board. However, the results of the
interrogative scope test and the interaction with negation suggest otherwise. Interestingly,
there are some subtle differences across the reportative constructions. The known-falsity
1100test and the stronger evidence cancellation test suggest that the marker =ikiá, the marker
that occurs in the clause-type/rank slot in verbal predicate constructions, is an illocutionary
marker but the kiá which covaries with markers of modality syntactically is a modal

it can occur internal to the verb complex without necessarily taking on a clear adverbial
function (see Section 5.2.3.9). Secondly, very frequently the morpheme does not describe

"Before moving on to a discussion of part-of-speech classes in Chácobo a
clarification regarding the use of the terms as bondedness continuum, morphotactic
variable, syntactic relation is in order. First, in this grammar all constructs have
morphotactic variables, regardless of where they are on the bondedness continuum. For
instance, morphotactic variables that define phrases are those of contiguity and
boundedness. The values of these morphotactic variables are such that they make what I
call phrases less morphotactic than stems.
Section 3.1 of this section described syntactic relations in terms of degrees of headdependent (a)symmetry. A head-dependent relation is typically conceptualized as
quintessentially “syntactic” since it is usually conceptualized as involving the combination
of “words”. Linguists are divided concerning whether syntactic relations between “words”
126extend into relations between elements inside words (e.g. Anderson 1980 vs. Bauer 1990;
Haspelmath 1992 vs. Croft 2001: 267). In the terminology of this thesis, the issue of
whether syntactic relations extend into words is formulated as follows: given a construct
consisting of two or more elements what is the correlation between the position of this
construct on the bondedness continuum and the asymmetry versus symmetry in syntactic
relations that these elements exhibit with each other? In the descriptive framework of this
thesis, therefore, whether syntactic relations extend into the “word” is a matter of degree
that could in principle vary between languages because syntactic relations and bondedness
(wordhood) vary along continuous parameters in a language specific fashion.
Syntactic relations and morphotactic variables combine to divide Chácobo
grammar into a number of categories. The next section discusses part-of-speech classes
distinctions based on distributional properties and the types of elements they can form
syntactic relations with.","[169, 170]"
"116(3.6)tsáya=kɨ
see=DEC:P
‘He/she/it saw him/her/it.’Bound morphemes and constructs are associated with the morphotactic pole of the
bondedness continuum. Free morphemes and constructs are associated with the syntactic
pole of the bondedness continuum.
The next morphotactic variable refers to the relative contiguity or separability of
the elements of a construct. It is more complex than the bound-free variable. The reason
for this is that, as pointed out in the introductory paragraph, contiguity is a matter of degree
(Croft 2001: 190). It refers to the degree to which the elements must occur together or are
separable by other morphemes or constructs. Below I describe why it must be a matter of
degree.
A classic test of contiguity is the test of interruptability (Bloomfield 1933: 180;
Mugdan 1994: 2552). According to this test, uninterruptable constructs are words
(morphotactic constructs). In the terminology adopted in this paper, we should be inclined
to consider an uninterruptable construct as one that leans towards the morphotactic end of
the continuum. The “test” is not actually so simple, however. The results of the test will
vary according to which element we choose as the interrupting one (Mugdan 1994;
Haspelmath 2011). One approach to this problem is to choose some property as definitional
for the interrupting element. Haspelmath (2011) suggests that the interrupting element must
117be a free form. But this choice is completely arbitrary. In this thesis, I will assume that the
contiguity of some construct is a morphotactic variable that can vary from 0 (most
morphotactic) upward to n (most syntactic), where n refers to the number of tests of
interruptability that can be defined by different types of interrupting elements.
To illustrate this idea consider the verb complex in (3.7). The verb complex in
(3.7a) consists of four morphemes; a verb root atʃ ‘grab’; the three grammatical morphemes
-a ‘transitive’; =má ‘causative’; =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’ all display different degrees
of contiguity with the verb root atʃ ‘grab’. The suffix -a ‘transitive’ is the most contiguous
in that it can never be separated from the verb root by a free form. The enclitic =ma
‘causative’ can be separated from the verb root by the free form negative marker. This is
shown in (3.7b). This morpheme is not separable from the verb root by any constructs that
can contain more than one free form (e.g. a verb complex or noun complex). However, the
clause-type enclitic =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’, can be separated from the verb root by a
noun complex (subject), that contains more than one free form. An example of this is
provided in (3.7b).","[159, 160, 161]"
"4.2.2 Interrogatives
4.2.2.1. Interrogatives - IntroductionAn interrogative refers to a grammatical structure which encodes typically that a speaker
is requesting information from a hearer (Sadock & Zwicky 1985: 178). In Chácobo, the
interrogative clause-type has a number of other functions apart from requesting
information, such as exhortation, greetings and expressions of regret. Typologically, two
types of interrogative constructions are typically recognized; polar and constituent
interrogatives. Polar interrogatives elicit a yes or no answer and constituent interrogatives
question some particular part of a sentence (König & Siemund 2007: 291). There is a
structural distinction between polar and constituent interrogatives in Chácobo. Crossclassifying the distinction between polar and constituent interrogatives is the distinction
223between interrogative verbal predicate and interrogative non-verbal predicate
constructions.
First, I illustrate the distinction between interrogative marking in verbal and nonverbal predicate constructions with the examples in (4.81) and (4.82). As stated above, in
non-verbal predicate constructions, interrogative clauses are marked with the morpheme ní
which occurs between the predicate phrase and the subject as in (4.81). In verbal-predicate
constructions, interrogativity is coded in the clause-type/rank morpheme. This is illustrated
in (4.82). Interrogative clauses are never marked through intonation to my knowledge.","[266, 267]"

example is provided in (15.131). The sentence is uttered in the context of a narrative about
how the speaker’s parents used to make chicha. The speaker uses toka ‘do in that way’ to
1244refer bac to these activities. Unlike the morpheme nɨka ‘do in this way’, the morpheme toka
is typically not systmetically associated with gestures.","[1287, 1288]"

there be one free form. This condition defines the left edge and the right edge of the
maximal minimum free form.
In the typological literature the minimum free form test is considered problematic
(Haspelmath 2011:39-40; Bickel & Zuñiga 2017:161).21 I mention it here because the
(minimal or maximal) minimum free form is the closest analogue in Chácobo to what is
described as the verbal “morphosyntactic/grammatical word” in grammars of other Panoan
languages (e.g. Fleck 2003:207; Valenzuela 2003:255; Zariquiey 2011:179). For instance,
Zariquiey (2011:179) seems to evoke the minimum free form test when he states that words
in Kashibo-Kakataibo “can be produced in isolation”. Fleck (2003: 207) states that “a word
[in Matses] is a stem combined with inflectional suffixes”. Fleck (2003:212) defines
inflection as “bound morphemes composing an obligatory category for a lexical class”. A
span of positions whose boundaries are defined as obligatory corresponds to the minimal
minimum free form test. Obligatory elements will be the ones one must produce to form a
complete utterance.","[393, 394]"

1045The most typical function of the epistemic kará in the context of noun phrases is to
indicate that the referent has some property associated with it unknown to the speaker
(“some type of X…”). It is difficult to render such sentences with a “literal” translation in
Spanish or English. The Chácobo typically translate them as questions in Spanish (que
clase de, que será …), although they are not structurally interrogatives and they do not have
the illocutionary function of a question. Examples of this function is provided in (13.68),
(13.69), (13.70), and (13.71).","[1088, 1089]"
"3.3. PARTS OF SPEECH
Roots and stems further divide into different part-of-speech classes. These are
nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and other categories. Typologically parts of speech are
organized around basic category prototypes, but they are language-specific categories in a
few important senses (Croft 2000, 2001; Rijkhoff 2007; Schachter and Shopen 2007; inter
alia). First, certain categories are not motivated in all languages. For instance, some
languages do not have a motivated adjective class (e.g. Chafe [2012] for Northern
127Iroquioan; Weber [1980: 36] for Quechua). Secondly, even where part-of-speech
categories can be identified, the criteria that distinguish them vary in a language-specific
fashion. This section provides the language-specific criteria that distinguish and motivate
different parts of speech.
Part-of-speech classes can be broadly distinguished according to whether they are
lexical or functional categories. Lexical categories denote things, events and properties
(Sapir 1921: Ch. 4). Functional categories inherently denote relational and/or abstract
concepts. By relational concepts I mean concepts that relate two or more things, events or
properties in a temporal, spatial or aspectual frame. For instance, the ergative case marker
in Chácobo found in (3.1) relates the event of seeing to a referent (the old man). The
ergative is, therefore, a functional category. The noun honi ‘man’ denotes a time-stable
entity and therefore it is a lexical category. The demonstrative toa ‘that’ in (3.2) is
functional in that it relates some entity to a point of reference.
The distinction between lexical and functional concepts is too vague to completely
operationalize, however. It is clear that there must be a continuum between lexical and
functional categories for processes such as grammaticalization to occurs at all; “semantic
bleaching” is a gradual process whereby a concrete (lexical) concept gradually becomes
more abstract or relational (e.g. Bybee 1985; Bybee, Perkins, Pagliuca 1994). Certain
semantic categories co-exist in multiple domains. For instance, the morpheme siri ‘old’
functions as a property on the one hand but it relates the concept it modifies to a temporal
frame. Furthermore, the morpheme siri ‘old’ can be used as a temporal adverb meaning ‘a
128long time ago’, where it seems to have a similar function to the remote past marker.
Chácobo also has a class of associated motion markers, a class of bound clitics that relate
a motion event to some main event. To illustrate the problem in assigning associated
motion morphemes to either a lexical or a functional class on semantic grounds alone
consider the sentences in (3.12). The example in (3.12a) combines the verb root pi with an
associated motion clitic =bona ‘going (transitive, plural)’. In the example in (3.12b) pi ‘eat’
combines with a nominalized verb ka=ʔai ‘going’. The sentences have similar meanings,
with subtle aspectual differences that will be discussed in Chapter 11 and Chapter 12. The
important point to note for now is that both=bona and ka express a motion event.","[170, 171, 172]"

go=CMPL=NEG=DEC:P
‘All of them did not go.’b.*ka=yáma=yó=kɨ
go=NEG=CMPL=DEC:P
‘All of them did not go.’Since =yó is in a fixed position with respect to other elements of the clause, no issue
of scope-based ordering arises. The criterion of fixed scopal ordering, thus, identifies a
span from position 1 to 3 in verb stratum 2.
In contrast to =yó ‘completive’, the negation morpheme =yáma can be variably
ordered with morphemes of position 4 (associated motion morphemes) and morphemes of
295position 5 (the punctual morpheme =tápi). This variable ordering is illustrated in (5.77)
and (5.78).","[338, 339]"
