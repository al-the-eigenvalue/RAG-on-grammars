"866Dictionaryhyrwa- (V) escape from a corral, go
round
In the third person declarative only -tse
is used: *hyrwaki. a'rǊi hy:'rwa'tsi
‘take care, the horse may escape!’.
hytxa- (V) drop
bala'hͿ hy'txadyta ‘(e.g. the stone)
slipped out of the hand unintentionally’.
-hӻ (svn) NOM
-hͿ- is by far the most frequently
occurring morpheme of Kwaza, and it
has a variety of functions. It is
basically a semantically neutral
nominaliser. 'kuida'hͿ txu'hǊitse ‘I
drank little’ (lit. ‘me-drinking was
little’), exa'hͿ ‘that which you have’,
tã'jã tawa'hͿ ‘the one called / they call
chief’. Kwaza having neither adjectives nor relativisation, attributive
modification is realised often by
nominalised verb roots in juxtaposition
to nouns, and complex attributive
constructions can be the result: dutu're
Ǌ'kaityhata'hͿ a'wͿidahͿki ‘I saw that
that pig who lay down in your
hammock’; tau'ta i'sitsyhͿ a'wͿidahͿki, isi'?ǊkatsahͿ, tsiri'tsajãhͿ ‘I saw a
dead sloth, one who died on the path,
one in the middle of the path’. The
nominaliser can function as a semantically neutral classifier: a'xy arwa'hͿ
‘new house’ vs. a'xy haka'xy ‘old
house’. It is often verbalised recursively. This results in cleft-like
constructions which can occur with a
variety of subtle, and sometimes rather
marginal grammatical, semantic and
pragmatic effects such as valencychange,
past,
progressive
and
emphasis: holanDa'na 'ahͿki ‘it is
(something which is) from Holland’;
ucenãi'hehͿ'dyjadaki ‘I make them not
understand’; lotenã unã'tsudahͿ'ta (or
ere'ridahͿ'ta) ka'tsudaki ‘because I
have long legs I step over the fence’.
In combination with animate object
marker -wã it forms a fixed combination which expresses an agent noun:o'kjahͿwã ‘hunter’. It is lexicalised in
many roots, such as e'hͿ- ‘to make’.
hӻ (ITJ) what?
‘huh?/uhh?’. Used as a minimal
response when one has not understood
what the previous speaker said.
hӻdİ (PART) let’s go!
Also [dæ]. Exhortative particle which
occurs often with a paucal exhortative.
hͿ'dİ toma'ja ‘let’s take a bath’, hͿ'dİ
İ'ja ‘let’s go!’.
hӻhӻ (ITJ) I don’t know
Negative minimal answer to a
question, pronounced as [hͿ'hͿ].
-hӻsi (svv) NEG
Expresses the habituality or extended
duration of a negative proposition, and
acts as a kind of ‘negative mood’
morpheme. ka'we atsuka'ko 'kuidahͿ'si

"7.1. Negation5277.1.1.4. Negation in different moods
Negation in the declarative and interrogative moods is relatively transparent.
The negative morpheme is generally inserted in a position before the mood
marker without any further adaptations:
(2796)ja-'he-da-ki
eat-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I did not eat’Questions can be asked in a negative form, and a negative response yields a
logically positive answer:
(2797)Q: mãrİ̘ri'tsa ja-'he-xa-re
person
eat-NEG-2-INT
‘do(n’t) you eat people?’A: hã'?ã (ja)-'he-da-ki
yes eat-NEG-1S-DEC
‘no’(2798)Q: atsile-'re
heavy-INT
‘is it very heavy?’A: ha'?ã
yes
‘yes (it is)’(2799)Q: atsile-'he-tsy-re
heavy-NEG-GER-INT
‘isn’t it very heavy?’A: ha'?ã
yes
‘yes (it isn’t)’Person-negative order also occurs in the interrogative. It questions a negative presupposition held by the speaker:

in the forest!”?’303 (t)(2801)be-tara-'ni-xa-he-re
ripe-PROC-CAUS-2-NEG-INT
‘why don’t you wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’The following example of a countersupposition is formally interrogative, but
not semantically. The interrogative is used emphatically here:303.Note that the glossing of -ni as exhortative represents a literal interpretation of a construction that may be also analysed as causational (like in the next example).","[564, 565]"
"7.1. Negation(2805)Q: kui-'nã-xa-re

‘are you going to bathe?’A: heQ: kukui-'re
hurt-INT
‘is (the pepper) strong?’A: 'he-tse
NEG-DEC
‘no’(2807)529NEG‘no!’In other contexts, an answer like 'hetse could mean ‘there isn’t (any)’, ‘he said
no’, etc.
The occurrence of rootless negation combined with further morphemes in
extraposition functions as a particle which emphasises the negative aspect of a
preceding negative sentence:
(2808)Ǌcenãi-'hͿ-he-ki
'he-tsy-hͿ
know-NOM-NEG-DEC NEG-GER-NOM
‘they don’t know anything’The same countersuppositionality as discussed in section (7.1.1.2.) can be
expressed in root ellipsis:
(2809)xa-'he-tsy-tse
İ-'ra
2-NEG-POT-DEC go-IMP
‘don’t you persist, go away!’ (t)This example is from a mythological story in which a boy, who presumed
wrongly that he could stay with his mother, is sent away.
The free occurrence of he'ki ‘no’ probably also negates a presupposition, but
the evidence is only circumstantial. In (8.1.2.1.) it is explained how negation is
not normally adjacent to an interrogative mood marker. However, when it is,
countersupposition is apparently involved. The following example suggests
this:
(2810)he-'reNEG-INT‘yes, isn’t it?’5307. Other morphosyntactic structuresThis example represents an utterance which confirms a statement. Its noncountersuppositional variant would be the interrogative equivalent of 'hetse ‘it
isn’t’ and it would inquire about the negation of the omitted root.306
Since the negative morpheme can occur as a verbal root, it is apparently also
found as root part of a compound. Compare the following examples:
(2811)darje-'he-tja
ojanͿ-'he-tse
strong-NEG-CSO arrive-NEG-DEC
‘because he is weak, he did not come hither’(2812)darje-'he-tja 'he=ojanͿ-ki
strong-NEG-CSONEG=arrive-DEC
‘because he is weak, he did not come hither’It is possible that the verb root he'?ai- ‘to want not’ originates from ellipsis and
compounding:
(2813)wƭ
he'?ai-xa-re
wine want.not-2-INT
‘you don’t want wine?’Although there is no verbal root *ai-, there are roots which may be historically
related, aitse- ‘to be patient’ and aitsehe- ‘to be lazy’.
There is one other type of expression in which the negative morpheme is
probably used elliptically:
(2814)i'si-da-nãi-'he
die-1S-NOM-NEG
‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) or else I’ll get drunk’(2815)ka'je=İ-da-nãi-'he
crawl=go-1S-NOM-NEG
‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) or else I’ll have to crawl’This construction is neither semantically nor grammatically understood very
well, and it is probably idiomatic. Example (2814) was considered as identical
to the following:306.This was created by myself:
he-tsy-'reNEG-GER-INT‘is it not?, isn’t it there?, did he say no?’7.1. Negation(2816)531isi-nã-ƭ-'tsi
die-FUT-NEG-MON
‘(I’m) not (going to drink more) lest I’ll get drunk’The structure of this latter example is relevant to section (7.1.2.).
7.1.1.6. Negative -he- in compounds
In compounds, the negative morpheme is encountered in various positions. It
may follow the second member and have scope over both:
(2817)areta=mã-'he-da-ki
know=call-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I don’t know how to call it’(2818)tsãrã=txu'hǊi-nahere

speak anything (of the Kanoê language)!’ (t)
(2819)tͅi'tja-da-ta
ja=bwa-'he-da-ki
alone-1S-CSO eat=finish-NEG-1S-DEC
‘being on my own, I can’t eat it all’The negative morpheme may also be inserted between the first and the second
member and have scope over only the first:
(2820)txa'rwa tsje-'he=bwa-ki
first
grab-NEG=finish-DEC
‘(the hawk) does not grab (chickens) any more’Literally this example means ‘(the hawk) ended up by not grabbing (chickens)’.307 When negative morphemes are on both members of a compound, they
only have scope over the immediately preceding root, and the result is coordination:307.The combination -he=bwa- is a fixed way to express ‘not any more’: dehemǊ'te kuihe'bwadaki ‘I don’t drink spirits anymore’.","[566, 567, 568, 569]"
"NegationNegation is expressed principally by a verbal suffix -he-. Its use and the different positions it can take inside the word will be discussed in section (7.1.1.). In
addition to the negation suffix, an emphatic marker with a negative effect has
been identified. It may be related to the adverb ƭ ‘idly’ and it is discussed in
(7.1.2.). Finally, the negative habitual morpheme -hͿsi, which replaces the
verb’s mood marker, is dealt with in (7.1.3.).
Besides these negative elements there are three specific prohibitive moods.
These are not treated here extensively, but in the chapter on mood, in sections
(5.2.7-10.).
7.1.1. The negative suffix -heThe negative suffix -he- occurs in two different basic types of constructions.
One expresses straightforward negation, and the other involves a counter of
presupposition. These constructions are formally distinct. In the negative construction, the suffix -he- attracts stress, it occurs in a position between the verb
root and person inflexion, and if the subject is a zero-marked third person, the
declarative mood marker is -tse. In the countersupposition construction, the
suffix -he- does not bear stress, it occurs in the position between person inflexion and the mood marker, and the declarative mood marker is -ki under all
circumstances. This situation can be schematised as follows:5207. Other morphosyntactic structuresTable 30. The negative suffix -he- in the declarative mood

‘V-person-he-ki
‘V-Ø-he-kiThe negative construction will be discussed in subsection (7.1.1.1.) and countersupposition in (7.1.1.2.). The other subsections deal with issues involving
the negative, which do not depend exclusively on the distinction between these
basic constructions. With respect to the formal expression of this distinction
Kwaza seems to be very rare among the Amazonian languages (see van der
Voort 2002b). Alternative placements of the negative and other morphemes
such as derivational future -nã- have been seldomly attested and have not yet
been the object of research.
7.1.1.1. Negation by -heNegation of predicates and propositions is realised through the bound verbal
morpheme -he-. In this construction, the negative suffix usually precedes person and mood marking:

‘he did not eat’
tsirjͿ-'he-tse

‘he hops, he limps’ (t)Cases of double negation inside the word have not been found. Repetition of
the negative suffix is not possible:
(2767)*hoi-he-he-tsesweet-NEG-NEG-DECThe antonyms of some verbs are expressed through litotes, i.e. by negation of the root through -he-:
(2768)tãi-ki
hard-DEC
‘it is hard’tãi-'he-tse
hard-NEG-DEC
‘it is soft’(2769)by'ru-ki
sharp-DEC
‘is sharp, pointed’byru-'he-tse
sharp-NEG-DEC
‘it is dull’Other such verbs are: atsile- ‘heavy’, atsilehe- ‘light’; darje- ‘strong’, darjehe‘weak’; mõ- ‘loud’, mõhe- ‘soft’; wai- ‘good’, waihe- ‘bad’. Similar phenomena in Kanoê were discussed by Bacelar and Rodrigues da Silva (i.p.).
It could be that in some verbs there is a lexicalised negative element, e.g.
hedutu- ‘lose’; hetxa- ‘bar’; hewedutu- ‘forget’; he?ai- ‘want not’.
Some verbs contain the element -he- as an integral part of the root, but it has
nothing to do with the negative morpheme:5227. Other morphosyntactic structures(2770)de'he-ki
bitter-DEC
‘it tastes bitter, strong, dry’dehe-'he-tse
bitter-NEG-DEC
‘it isn’t bitter’There is no lexical root *de-.
7.1.1.2. The counter of presupposition by -he
In the countersupposition construction, the negative morpheme is found in a
different position, after person inflexion. Furthermore, the negator does not
tend to attract stress (whereas the mood marker sometimes does). Compare the
following examples and notice the difference in meaning:
(2771)kawİ
kui-'he-da-ki
coffee drink-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I did not drink coffee (yet)’(2772)kawİ
'kui-da-he-ki
coffee drink-1S-NEG-DEC
‘I’m not drinking coffee (but something else)’294Apparently, the order in which the negative precedes the person marker indicates negation of the action expressed by the verb root. The reverse order, person-negative, seems to indicate negation of the object of the verb. A somewhat
similar difference may be observed between the following examples:
(2773)awͿi-'he-(c)wa-ki
(2774)
see-NEG-IS-DEC
‘he did not see’,
‘they are not watching now’a'wͿi-wa-he-ki
see-IS-NEG-DEC
‘they did not look’,
‘he didn’t (go there to) have a look’The following example shows how satellites marked by oblique case are contrasted in the countersupposition construction:
(2775)kuja'ba-na
oja-da-'he,
vilena-ko-'le
leave-IS-NEG Vilhena-INS-only
Cuiabá-LOC
‘I didn’t go to Cuiabá, only to Vilhena’Note that this example, which is from family II, is elliptic since the mood
marker is absent, and it forms an exception to the statement that the negative
does not attract stress in the countersupposition construction.
294.Unfortunately, main stress placement in the word kawİ was not registered. Here it is
probably on the first syllable and in the previous example on the second syllable.","[557, 558, 559, 560]"

‘I was not happy for nothing, they’ve really arrived’304Emphatic use of the interrogative was discussed in (5.2.2.1.).
In sections (5.2.7-10.) three special prohibitive moods were identified and
described: negative imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. They form
the respective counterparts to the three persuasive moods imperative, exhortative causative and volitive.
Only the negation of the exhortative is transparent in the sense that the
negative marker -he- precedes exhortative -ni. There is a less transparent, nondiscontinuous, negative exhortative -ini, but this has only been attested in relatively fixed expressions. Negative exhortative is discussed in (5.2.8.).
The negative imperative also contains the identifiable negative marker -he-,
but the mood marker is different: -ky. Even though the negative imperative may
be expressed in a discontinuous way, the element -ky does not occur as a mood
marker without -he- (see 5.2.7.). Only few instances of negation of the imperative as marked by -ra were attested:
(2803)ehͿ-'he-ca-ra
make-NEG-EMP-IMP
‘don’t do that!’305(*ehͿhecaky)Apparently, the alternative mild imperative which involves the potential marker
-tsy- and which is discussed in (5.2.3.1.) can also be negated with -he-:
(2804)tsuhǊ-'du-xa-lİ
nãi-xa-'he-tsy-tse
what-BER-2-PREC like-2-NEG-POT-DEC
‘you are not going to do thus, because (he is your son)’ (t)A real negative counterpart of the volitive was not attested. Instead, there is
a monitory mood which was discussed in (5.2.9.). It is marked by monomorphemic -tsi, which bears no formal resemblance to the negative morpheme.
7.1.1.5. Negative -he- and ellipsis
The negative morpheme -he- also seems to occur as a verb root or even as a
negative particle. This use of -he- is only possible in the proper context. Therefore, in the present analysis this is regarded as the result of ellipsis, which is
discussed in (7.5.).","[565, 566]"
"241. IntroductionNominal morphology is fairly simple. Nouns, including pronouns, demonstratives and numerals, are not inflected for number or gender. Only a third
person possessor may be morphologically marked. Nouns may receive animate
object case marking or one of the oblique case markers: instrumental, locative,
beneficiary and comitative. Nouns can be zero-verbalised by attachment of person and mood marking. Nouns can be modified by other nouns which are
placed in juxtaposition. Because complex verb forms can be nominalised and
function as nouns, nouns can of course be morphologically complex.
Verbs are obligatorily marked for subject and mood, whereas overt pronominal or lexical arguments are optional. Both the subject agreement system
and the personal pronoun system contain a distinction between first person inclusive and first person exclusive. Since the system explicitly indicates exclusive agreement, by the form -xa-, the notions “singular” and “plural” are used
for convenience sake, even though the system is analysed as being based on
distinctions of “association”. Third person agreement is zero-marked. Indefinite
argument agreement has no lexical counterpart. Mood inflexion comprises declarative, interrogative, the three persuasive moods imperative, exhortative and
volitive, which complement one another, and three prohibitive moods negative
imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. In the imperative and negative
imperative, second person “singular” subject agreement is zero-marked. Object
agreement of the verb is optional and can perhaps be regarded as derivational.
Negation, valency and valency change, and tense, modality and aspect are also
marked by a wide array of (probably derivational) verbal morphemes. Some
morphemes of modality are etymologically related to mood markers, such as
the causational morpheme -nƭ- and the exhortative mood marker -ni. Verbs can
be turned into nouns or adverbs by the highly multifunctional stem-final nominalising morphemes -hͿ and -nãi.
Two quite prominent morphological categories in Kwaza are those of class
and directionality. Classifying morphemes have a very wide distribution and
may have nominalising and agreement properties. They can have a very general
meaning and refer to shape, substance and texture, but the majority are semantically rather specific. In the present analysis, there are close to 150 classifiers.
Directional morphemes have a more limited distribution. They either occur on
verbs, where they indicate the direction in which an action or event takes place,
or they are used to form directional adverbs. There are nearly 45 directionals.
The distributions of classifiers and directionals overlap partially, and a small
number of these morphemes are ambiguous in this respect.
The moods mentioned earlier are restricted to matrix clauses. In Kwaza several different types of subordinate clauses may be formed. Subordinate clauses
usually precede matrix clauses. The predicates of subordinate clauses contain
the same subject agreement forms as mentioned earlier, but they have different
“mood” markers. Among the adverbial clauses there are two types of conditional clauses, two basic types of concessive clauses, and additive, manner,
temporal and contemporative clauses, all marked by different predicate-final
morphemes. Among the nominal clauses there are attributive (relative) clauses1.9. Structural characteristics of Kwaza25and complement clauses. These involve the same nominalisers as referred to
above. Kwaza does neither have infinitives nor conjunctional particles. However, long chains of medial clauses can be constructed through the cosubordinative “mood” marker. In these constructions a distinction is made between
same subject and different subject. The different subject marker is always
found on the subordinate clause, whereas it indicates that the subject of the next
clause is going to be different. When one of the different subjects is a non-third
person, a special switch reference mood marker is required.
A special phenomenon in Kwaza, rare among the Amerindian languages, is
morphological ellipsis. Although verbs are canonically obligatorily marked for
person and mood, these inflexions can be omitted if the context permits. Inversely, the inflexional complex of person and mood marking can occur freely
without a verb stem under similar circumstances. In both situations the hearer
can be expected to deduce from the context which verb stem or which inflexions were intended by the speaker. On a more grammatical level, independently
occurring person and mood inflexions can also function as resumptive particles, and double layers of person and mood inflexion are instrumental in morphologically complex constructions which have “complementising” functions
such as desiderative and quotation. A discussion of these phenomena from the
perspective of grammaticalisation was also the subject of a separate article (van
der Voort 2002a). Other unique grammatical phenomena in Kwaza concern
morphologically motivated reduplication of bound person markers to express
tense distinctions, and alternative morpheme orders to formally express the
distinction between canonical negation and negation of a presupposition.
In the lexicon of Kwaza many items are encountered which show morphological structure. Often, formally similar roots without such morphological
complexity are semantically related, but not in an entirely productive way.
Therefore, such apparent morphological complexity is considered as lexicalised
and such roots are treated as monomorphemic. Nevertheless, there are certain
roots which are (semi-)lexicalised with morphemes that retain some productive
properties, such as those of the verb stem haka-(hͿ)- ‘to be old’. In the present
work I refer to these latter roots as bound or etymological roots.
The following text excerpt is to illustrate some of the phenomena mentioned
in the present section:

A short grammatical sketch of the language was presented in van der Voort
(2000b). Aikhenvald and Dixon (1999:363-364) contains a brief typological
characterisation of the language.
1.10. The classification of Kwaza
If mentioned at all, Kwaza is usually classified as “isolated” (e.g. Loukotka
1963, 1968 and Rodrigues 1986). In two recent sources, Kwaza is even registered as an extinct (Kaufman 1990:49) or possibly extinct (Campbell 1997:198)
isolated language. For the lack of sufficient comparative data, solid proof for
the classification as isolated has been absent so far. Therefore, Kwaza is in reality an unclassified language.
In some sources, the language is affiliated with other languages. In Loukotka (1950:128), Kwaza is under the name “language of the São Pedro creek”
grouped together with Kapixana (i.e. Kanoê) as a Kapixana language, probably
because of the apparent cognate lexeme aki ‘stone’ (1950:141). In the same article, however, the language is considered as an unclassified language, under
the name Quaia (1950:137). In 1957, Loukotka identified the São Pedro language on the basis of Zack’s manuscript (1943) as Kwaza and classifies it under the names “Koaiá or Quaiá” as isolated (Loukotka 1963:12).
Greenberg (1987) classified Kwaza on the basis of a few lexemes as belonging to the Macro-Tucanoan linguistic stock: e'cǊi ‘eye’, mani'ni ‘fish’,
ha'ki ‘stone’, hi ‘fire’, co'ha ‘foot’, cuku ‘tongue’ and e'tay ‘woman’. The word
ha'ki is probably correctly related to Kanoê (Capixana) and Aikanã (Huari), but
the other words, which he compares to forms in Puinave, seem far-fetched. If
these words should point to a relation with Macro-Tucanoan, then a score of
other words can be added to the list with an equal degree of plausibility, such
as hoi ‘bat’, mã'bi ‘arrow’, jã'si- ‘hear’, tai ‘lizard’, e'kãi ‘mouth’ and others
(compare also the Proto-Tucanoan forms as reconstructed by Waltz and
Wheeler 1972). In fact, several of these words, and many others, can be related
to Aikanã and Kanoê as well (the inclusion of which in Macro-Tucanoan or
any other stock is as questionable as of Kwaza). Note furthermore that a number of words could be just as well related to languages from other stocks proposed by Greenberg. The correspondences are fascinating but the long dis1.11. Organisation of the present work27tances combined with the sparse evidence make Greenberg’s claims premature.
In van der Voort (fcb), the linguistic correspondences and possible relationships between Kwaza and neighbouring languages are discussed.
1.11. Organisation of the present work
This book consists of three parts: a grammar (part I), texts (part II) and a dictionary (part III). It is an attempt to describe the Kwaza language. It neither
follows a specific theoretical model, nor does it examine theoretical implications of the analysis. Its primary concern is to prevent the Kwaza language
from disappearing without leaving behind representative documentation. The
description is intended to be comprehensive and dependable, so that theoretical
issues can be dealt with in later studies.
The basic orientation of this grammar is formal rather than functional, that
is, the structure of the present description is determined by the productive
forms of the language and the way they are used, rather than by possible
grammatical functions and the way these are realised by the grammatical system. Nevertheless, the sections are not always located where they could be expected to be on formal grounds. The subsection about classifiers (4.2.) is relevant both for nominal and verbal morphology. Since classification is important
for a complete understanding of attributive modification, numerals and demonstratives, I have discussed it prior to these. The subsections which concern adverbial affixes (6.2.4.) have been placed together, because I deemed it convenient to have all adverbial morphology in one place rather than scattered
throughout the book. Finally, the chapter on complex constructions (8.) also
has a basis in verbal morphology. However, since that morphology is characteristic for subordinate clauses, its grammatical domain is greater than that of
the verb alone. Therefore, I have discussed it after the sections on nouns, verbs
and adverbs. The subsections of (8.) together provide a complete account of
subordinate clause formation. If a strictly formal arrangement were followed,
the discussion of subordinate constructions would become highly fragmented.
Additionally, some minor subsections have been assigned to chapters on functional grounds, such as (5.1.7.) on the impersonal use of the special verb root
jã- ‘to be’, although they are also mentioned in chapters where they belong
formally (in this case 7.6.2.).
In the present work the subject of morpheme order has not been discussed
thoroughly. Its basic characteristics are dealt with briefly in (3.2.) as a separate
issue. Otherwise, it is only discussed in an ad hoc manner in those places where
it is of immediate importance for identification or proper understanding of a
specific morpheme, such as e.g. the negative morpheme -he- in (7.1.).
With regard to the internal organisation of the subsections, I have striven to
discuss the most common constructions, and the examples which serve to illustrate them, first, and the more exceptional ones towards the end of these
subsections.","[61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"

kahİ-'he-ja-ki
fear-TRA-NEG-NEI bite-NEG-IO-DEC
‘don’t be afraid of it, it (e.g. spider) does not bite anyone’Example (1482) also indicates that the negative imperative is a discontinous
morpheme. The negation marker is separated both by subject and object crossreference from the mood marker.
There is another negative imperative with a less immediate future reading. It
involves -ky in a compound combination with the verbal root ihƭ- ‘on the contrary’, ‘it isn’t like that’, ‘wait!’. This verbal root may contain or be related to
the adverbial negative element ƭ (see 7.1.2.). The effect of this construction reminds of the ones with procrastinative -tara- ‘later’ (see 5.5.19.).

‘you should not want to kill him!’ (t)(1487)awre-'ja-damͿ=ihƭ-ky
'İ-da-kywy
marry-IO-want=contrary-NEI go-1S-COND
‘don’t think of getting married to someone while I’m gone!’The presence of future -nã- and -damͿ in most of these examples seems to express ‘want’ rather than ‘future’. In combination with the interjection particle
ja'le ‘wait a little!’, ihƭky can do without a future morpheme:
(1488)ja'le=ihƭ-ky
(1489)
wait!=contrary-NEI
‘wait a little bit more!’ja'le=ihƭ-ky
'kui-da-mͿ
wait!=contrary-NEI drink-1S-VOL
‘hold it!, I’m going to drink!’
(fig. ‘let me drink’)5.2. Mood321In some of the previous examples the element -ky- occurred as part of the Conditional marker -kywy. It has no negative or imperative value there, but it may
be related to the negative imperative -ky. It will be discussed in (8.2.1.).
A possible third type of negative imperative is found in the particle-like expression nãi?ini ‘don’t do (it)!’, ‘stop!’. As it employs the exhortative mood
marker -ni, it will be treated below in (5.2.8.).
Another different negative imperative is probably a fixed expression. Only
one example was attested:
(1490)nãi-'ky-xa-ta'nãi-nãi
'e-xa-re
like-IMP-2-CSO like-NOM have-2-INT
‘why on earth are you doing that?’ (stop it!) (t)Example (1490) seems to represent neither an elliptic construction, nor an instance of rapid speech where the element -he- was deleted, because in a subsequent discussion with the consultant it was repeated in exactly the same way.
A final type of negative imperative was discussed in (5.2.3.). This is an emphatic negative imperative construction illustrated by the examples (1371) and
(1372). The following examples illustrate the contrast between this negated
emphatic imperative construction and the canonical prohibitive negative imperative:
(1491)ja-'he-ca-ra
eat-NEG-EMP-IMP
‘you are nót going to eat!
(since you didn’t work)’(1492)'ja-he-ky
eat-NEG-NEI
‘don’t eat!’These examples suggest that the presence of emphatic -ca- (see 5.2.3.3.) requires -ra instead of -ky.
5.2.8. Negative exhortative
The negative exhortative is also one of the three prohibitive moods. It involves
the original exhortative mood marker -ni, and the negative morpheme -he-. It
was seldom attested.
(1493)ehͿ-'he-a-ni
make-NEG-1P-EXH
‘let us not do that, we’re not going to do it’A formally less predictable type of negative exhortative is found in the particle-like expression nãi?ini ‘don’t do (it)!’, ‘stop!’. It employs the exhortative
mood marker -ni together with the element -i-, which may be related to the adverbial negative particle ƭ ‘nothing’. A nasalised pronunciation of -ini as [!ƭnƭ]3225. The verb phrasewas observed, but rejected on my explicit inquiry about it. It is probably quite
lexicalised.
(1494)'nãi-i'ni wara'hͿ-he-ky
like-NEE touch-NEG-NEI
‘don’t do that, don’t touch!’189The verbal root nãi- means ‘to be like that’, ‘to do thus’ and its reduplication
has an emphatic function, which results in the sense of ‘very’ or ‘thanks!’:
(1495)na-nãi-i'ni-xa-reRED-like-NEE-2-INT(1496)‘thanks”, (lit. ‘you
(will) leave (it) be?’190)na-nãi-i'ni
RED-like-NEE
‘let (it) be!’, ‘don’t do that!’,
‘refrain from (it)!’, ‘stop!’This expression is a negative exhortative as regards form and probable literal
meaning. From a functional point of view it should perhaps rather be viewed as
a negative imperative. Because of the lack of less idiomatic examples in which
the semantic value of a possible productive use of -i-ni could be investigated
more thoroughly, I have decided to discuss it here where it belongs at least
from a formal point of view.191 It should be added that the latter expression
(1496) was given explicitly as an alternative for ehͿ'hetjara ‘don’t do that!’ as
shown in (1371).
5.2.9. Monitory
The monitory mood is also one of the prohibitive moods. It is expressed by the
morpheme -tsi and it has a cautionary or admonitory value as it is used to warn
the hearer that something dangerous or unpleasant may happen. The zeromarked person is the third person subject argument of the verb. Usually, the
subject is not identical with the hearer to whom the admonition is directed:
(1497)'hyja-'tsi
(1498)
fall-MON
‘don’t let him fall!’
(lit. ‘(watch out) he may fall!’)jere'xwa 'ja-tsi
auxwa'nã
jaguar eat-MON meat
‘don’t let the dog eat the meat!’
(alternative order: 321)189.When pronounced angrily and fast: [nãi'nƭ wa4a'hӁkÓ].
190.The existence of an expression meaning ‘thanks’ is usually denied, so this may approach a calque on POR não precisa! ‘you don’t have to do that’.
191.In case productive use were attested and (*)kui-i-ni were to mean ‘don’t you drink!’,
then it would fit better in (5.2.7.).","[357, 358, 359, 360]"

"7.1. Negation523Probably, the interpretation of negative+person order reversal is dependent
on relations of scope:
(2776)Q:au'Beto-'le
a'wͿi-xa-re
Alberto-only see-2-INT
‘you only saw Alberto?’A:ay-hͿ-'le
a'wͿi-da-he-'ki
that-NOM-only see-1S-NEG-DEC
‘I did not see only him (I saw the other one too)’295In (2776) the subject did see the object Alberto, but not exclusively him. Apparently then, the negative morpheme corrects a presupposition which is present in the context of speech. In this case the presupposition to be corrected is
represented by the morpheme -le ‘only’. In the following example -he- seems
to negate -rata:
(2777)xyi-ra'ta
a'wͿi-xa-hͿ-he-ki
you-first
see-2-NOM-NEG-DEC
‘you didn’t see it first (I did)’296
(lit. ‘it isn’t so that you were the first one to see it’)Also in (2777), the subject did see the object, but he was not the first one to do
so. In the ensuing examples person-negative morpheme order may also be connected with the counter of presuppositions:
(2778)si 'nãi-da-he-ki
I like-1S-NEG-DEC
‘it wasn’t me’297(2779)tsuhǊ-'du 'cu-da-he-tsy-tse
koreja-'ko
what-BER cut-1S-NEG-POT-DEC knife-INS
‘I can’t cut (down the mahogany tree) with a machete’(2780)tsuhǊ-'du-tsy-lİ
a-'ta-ta-he-tsy-tse
what-BER-GER-PREC exist-TRA-1O-NEG-POT-DEC
‘what good would it be?, he couldn’t stay together with me’ (t)295.The full expression in Kwaza for ‘I did not only see Alberto, but the other one too’
does not involve a negative, but a positive extra medial clause.
296.There is no unambiguous way to express: ‘you saw it last’.
297.On one occasion, the consultant MA said that this sentence consists of three words:
si nãi daheki. This could be an indication that Kwaza is morphologically less complex than I presume. On the other hand, he said elsewhere that words can occur unfinished, and do require to be completed.","[560, 561]"
"6047. Other morphosyntactic structuresha?ã ‘here!’. The element ha?ã is used when one presents something to someone:
(3214)ha'?ã
u'ru
here!
patua
‘look, here are patua seeds!’hӻ?ӻ ‘yes, O.K.’. As a positive minimal response, hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes, O.K.’ is used.
The second syllable bears the accent. It can also be pronounced as hã'?ã, hã'hã,
hy'?Ϳ, “hmhm” or Ϳ'hͿ. It is also a positive minimal response to commands.
Roquette-Pinto (1950:152) attributes the wide diffusion of “Hum! Hum!” in
this function among Brazilians, esp. in Mato-Grosso and Rondônia, to Indian
influence.
tse ‘yes’. Another positive minimal response is tse ‘yes’, sometimes pronounced as [se]. It is used much in family II. It is not to be confused with the
interjection tsİh ‘why!’ or the declarative morpheme -tse.
(3215)Q: wa'txi-re
true-INT
‘would it be true?’A: tse
yes
‘yes’hӻ?ӻ ‘no’. As a negative minimal response, 'hͿ?Ϳ ‘no’ is used. The first syllable has a higher pitch than the second one and it also bears the accent. The
vowel of the second syllable is often long.
hӻhӻ ‘I don’t know’. As a minimal negative answer to a question hͿ'hͿ ‘I don’t
know’ is used:
(3216)Q: ti-'rjͿ-re
koreja'ro
what-CD:area-INT pan
‘where is the pan?’A: hͿ'hͿ
/ tsy-'re
don’t know / GER-INT
‘I don’t know’ƭnƭ ‘O.K.’. The element ƭnƭ ‘O.K., yes it is, let him!’, also pronounced as [ƭ'ni],
is a reassuring reply to comment or a warning about someone else:
(3217)R: ja-e-da'mͿ-tse
A: ƭ'nƭ
O.K.
eat-again-want-DEC
‘he (said he) is going to eat again’
‘let him!’, ‘it’s O.K.!’It seems possible that the part -nƭ of ƭnƭ is etymologically related to the exhortative morpheme -ni and the part ƭ- to the pronoun ƭ ‘he’.","[641, 642]"
"5327. Other morphosyntactic structures(2821)ja-'he=kui-'he-tse
eat-NEG=drink-NEG-DEC
‘he didn’t eat and didn’t drink’7.1.1.7. Miscellaneous constructions involving -heThere is a relation between interrogative lexemes and negation. Kwaza has
neither an indefinite pronoun nor a negative pronoun. In combination with verbal negation the interrogative pronoun fulfils the functions of indefinite negative pronoun. Note the following construction:
(2822)di'lİ onİ-'he-tse
who arrive-NEG-DEC
‘no-one came’There are also less transparent uses of the negative in combination with interrogative roots. The following example represents a fixed way to express a decided or indignant refusal:
(2823)tsuhǊ-'du-da-lİ
pİ̘rİ̘jã-'tja-da-he-tsy-tse
speak-TRA-1S-NEG-POT-DEC
what-BER-1S-PREC
‘why should I talk to him?, I won’t!’308The next example expresses great doubt or even despair:
(2824)ti-'nãi-da-he-tsy-tse
what-NOM-1S-NEG-POT-DEC
‘what am I going to do now?’ (t)It was not attested whether this latter example really represents a specific fixed
way to express doubt, but the combination of negation and an interrogative root
does suggest that this is the case.
In combination with a verb marked negative the adverb da'nͿ ‘still’ should
be interpreted as ‘not yet’, ‘before’:
(2825)da'nͿ
İ-'he-nã-da-ki
still
go-NEG-FUT-1S-DEC
‘I’m not going away yet’(2826)da'nͿ
awe-'he-tsy-wy
still
rain-NEG-GER-time
‘before the rain’ (lit. ‘the time it hasn’t rained yet’)308.Lit. ‘there is no reason for me to talk to him’.","[569, 570]"
"Précis: prohibitiveThe latter three moods; the negative imperative, the exhortative and the monitory, can be regarded as prohibitive. The prohibitive moods are more or less the
negative equivalents of persuasive moods. There are a number of systematic
and idiomatic correspondences and differences. As a systematic difference in
the first place, there is no special negative volitive. A predictable negative
equivalent of the volitive was neither attested. Consequently, first person singular and first person exclusive arguments have not been encountered at all in5.2. Mood327any of the prohibitive moods as subject. As an object, however, the first person
singular has been attested in the monitory mood, marked conspicuously by the
imperative first person singular object cross-reference morpheme -ta?Ϳ-.
As a second difference it is remarkable that almost none of the productive
prohibitive mood markers is immediately traceable to the sum of negation and
persuasive mood. Under negation, persuasive mood-markers are suppleted by
different mood markers, like -ky and -tsi, or, alternatively, negation itself is
marked differently, as by -i- or by zero-marking. Therefore, the prohibitive is
not predictable or, in another relatively improper use of the term, “analytic”.
The prohibitive corresponds to the persuasive insofar as none of the moods
cover the entire range of formally possible subjects, and that the different
moods complement one another in that they go with different mutually exclusive subjects. This complementary aspect which is shared among the prohibitive roots, is also semantically motivated.
With respect to their possible subject ranges the prohibitive moods nevertheless complement one another in a slightly different way than do the persuasive moods. There is an apparent overlap between monitory and negative imperative with respect to the second person singular. This is not a true overlap,
however, because the second person singular subject of the monitory is not a
“controlling” subject, whereas the one of the negative imperative is. The two
other negative imperative mood expressions with second person singular are
the exceptional “analytic” one as attested in example (1371), and the rather
lexicalised element ƭhƭky. Also the third person subject of a prohibitive mood is
covered by two moods: apart from the monitory, there is a lexicalised negative
exhortative expression ending in -ini.
Finally the negative equivalents of the imperative and the exhortative tend
to be represented by the negative imperative and the monitory respectively.
This pattern is disturbed for the zero-marked subjects, where alternative expressions are possible. The negative exhortative seems quite rare.
In the following table, all canonical combinations of subject cross-reference
and prohibitive mood marking are united. Slots containing a single hyphen indicate that the expression of cross-reference is zero. The hyphen on one of the
second person singular subject abbreviations indicates that the verb is not
“controlled” whereas the plus added to the other one indicates that the subject
does “control” the verb.

"5247. Other morphosyntactic structures(2781)ute-'ta
duture cari-da-he-'ki=tse
shoot-1S-NEG-DEC=DEC
notify-CSO pig
‘he said he did not kill a pig’298In the negative of the declarative mood, the zero-marked third person does not
cause ambiguity as regards presupposition. In the case of straightforward negation, the verb is terminated by -he-tse, and in the case of countersupposition by
-he-ki. In (2782) below, the speaker knows that the coffee is not sweet, and in
(2783) the speaker discovers that the coffee is, against his expectations, not
sweet:
(2782)hoi-'he-tse
sweet-NEG-DEC
‘it isn’t sweet’ (speaker warns a hearer who intends to drink)(2783)'hoi-he-ki
sweet-NEG-DEC
‘it isn’t sweet’ (speaker establishes an unexpected fact)The context in which the next example was elicited represents circumstantial
evidence that it is countersuppositional:
(2784)wai-he-'ki
good-NEG-DEC
‘it doesn’t taste good’This sentence was uttered in reaction to the remark: ‘what a tasty soup you’ve
made!’. A similar situation was observed in the next example:
(2785)'si-dy-hͿ
etohoi-he-'ki
I-POS-NOM child-NEG-DEC
‘he is not my child’ (t)This sentence was uttered by a woman from a mythological story who had become a misandrist and did not even want to recognise her own son any more. If
these examples represent negations of presuppositions, it may be assumed that
the zero-third person morpheme is located before the negator and the mood
marker: -Ø-he-ki.
In family II, the combination -he-ki with zero-marked third person, seems to
be more common than in family I. The combination -he-ki cited in (5.2.1.1.)
probably indicates countersupposition as well, but more research is needed.
The contrastive morpheme -hehͿ also has a countersuppositional use. Also
other morphemes such as desiderative -heta- ‘would like’, conjectural -here
298.The context is probably that he killed something else.","[561, 562]"
"4265. The verb phraseThe appellative may have an edifying tone. The ostensibly counterintuitive result is that a very affirmative statement is phrased as a question:
(2160)cu'ku-herejã-re
tongue-APPL-INT
‘(it is called the) tongue’The appellative -herejã- can be used to express irritation or indignation at
someone “who should know”:
(2161)a=a'nǊ-herejã-re
('rai?ͿhͿ)
RED=plant-APPL-INT thing
‘he is planting (things), don’t you see?’(2162)Q: ti-'rjͿ-re
koreja'ro
what-CD:area-INT pan
‘where is the pan?’(2163)wady-nƭ'nã-da-hͿ-herejã-re
give-2O-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
‘I’ve already given it to you!’A: 'jã-Ϳ-hͿ-herejã-re
DIST-this-NOM-APPL-INT
‘it is there, don’t you see?’Note about the following example, which concerns an order which has not been
obeyed, that the order itself is embedded as a quoted utterance on a deeper
level:
(2164)tsoroi=oja-'ra-da-hͿ-herejã-re
run=go-IMP-1S-NOM-APPL-INT
‘I asked you to run from there!’ (t)The appellative may furthermore express a complaint, such as about someone’s
drinking:
(2165)'kui-herejã-hͿ
drink-APPL-NOM
‘I think he was drinking, wasn’t he?’Or it is used to express irritation at someone who is nagging. The following example was given in a context where the hearer has tried to tease the speaker
about (the latter) not drinking enough chicha:
(2166)'kui-da-herejã-re
drink-1S-APPL-INT
‘am I drinking, or what!’5.5. Tense, modality and aspect427However, irritation is often faked:
(2167)Q: wãnͿ'dy 'a-xa-re
food
exist-2-INT
‘do you have food?’
(lit. ‘is there food with you?’)(2168)'kui-xa-hͿ-herejã-re
drink-2-NOM-APPL-INT
‘of course you may drink!’A: a-he'rejã-ki
exist-APPL-DEC
‘of course there is!
(otherwise I wouldn’t offer)’The appellative is also used in contexts where one tries to fool someone. The
next example was given in a context where the speaker tried to make the hearer
believe that he was drinking, whereas in reality the drink was thrown away:

"Temporary contrast ihƭ-There is a verb root ihƭ- ‘on the contrary, it isn’t like that, wait!’, which often
occurs as a second element in compounds. It has a negative value which is discussed in (7.1.2.) and it is also encountered in certain negative imperative constructions illustrated in (5.2.7.).
In addition to a negative sense, ihƭ- has some further interrelated connotations. In the first place, it has a contrastive semantic value, i.e. it negates a presumed presupposition. Secondly, the negation it expresses may be only temporary. The following example is from a dialogue in which TE explains why the
next day is not suitable for work:4585. The verb phrase(2366)ME: tsu'hǊ e'hͿ-a-tsy-re

"5.2. Mood319The exhortative also differs from the imperative in a complementary way.
An exhortative utterance in Kwaza can be viewed as a command that is directed to a non-hearer. As shown in (5.2.4.) its possible subject is either included with the speaker or it is a third or even indefinite person. An exhortation
directed to a hearer who is subject is automatically interpreted as having an imperative value and is marked accordingly.
In this way the grammatical mood-marking system of Kwaza reflects some
basic semantic properties of the illocutions taken together here under the common denominator of “persuasive”. In the following table, all possible canonical
combinations of subject cross-reference and persuasive mood markers are
united. Slots containing a single hyphen indicate that the expression of crossreference is zero.

The negative imperative can be regarded as one of three attested “prohibitive”
moods (see 5.2.10.). In the negative imperative the negative element -he- is
readily recognisable. The mood marker, however, is not -ra, but -ky:
(1480)(ay-'hͿ) kui-'he-ky
that-NOM drink-NEG-NEI
‘don’t drink that!’(*kui-'he-ra)In all other respects the negative imperative is the negative equivalent of the
imperative. The next examples demonstrate that a plural subject is crossreferred to by the associated person marker -xa- only, instead of -xa-xa-, and
that the second person subject is zero-marked while in cosubordinate sentences
it remains marked by the second person marker -xa-.188188.This issue has been discussed exhaustively in (5.2.3.).","[356, 357]"

it is a particle, it represents the adverb ƭ ‘idly’ and is homophonous with the

(2838)ƭ
kui-tsy-nãi-'le-xa-ki

"5267. Other morphosyntactic structuresNevertheless, (2791) does involve the counter of presupposition. It would be a
proper reply to, for instance, an unjustified remark that the subject be at work.
This construction represents the origin of the contrastive suffix -hehͿ. This suffix, which is further discussed in (5.5.29.), is regarded as a fixed combination.
There is a related construction, however, in which the negative morpheme
seems to be still productive. In this construction, the original nominaliser is replaced by a classifier:
(2792)eto'hoi-da-he-xwa
child-1S-NEG-CL:man

is significant here, since it contains the morpheme order person-negationnominalisation and it counters a presupposition.
There is an alternative, more productive nominalised construction which
expresses countersupposition. Here the morphemic order is personnominalisation-negation:

nominalised and then zero-verbalised and negated. However, they do involve
countersupposition, so the rule seems to be that the place of the nominaliser is
less important than the fact that the negative morpheme follows person marking. The function of the nominaliser here is mainly to create a cleft construction.

The verb phrase
Kwaza verbs can be morphologically highly complex and there are many different suffixes. A verb in Kwaza consists minimally of a bound root and
obligatory person and mood suffixes. Between the root and the obligatory suffixes other, optional, suffixes may be inserted. The obligatory suffixes, which
can only be omitted when the speech context allows, are considered as inflexional. The optional suffixes are considered as derivational. Their occurrence
depends on the specific state of affairs as described or expressed by the utterance.
The distinction between derivation and inflexion is not clear-cut. Valency
changing suffixes, aspectual suffixes, directionals and the like are optional, and
could be considered as derivational. Subject cross-reference151 markers and
mood markers are obligatory and could be considered as inflexional. Modal
suffixes and object cross-reference markers are to a certain extent optional and
they take a position inside the word between the derivational and inflexional
suffixes.
Although I do not make an explicit and categorical formal distinction between derivational and inflexional morphemes, I do distinguish different types
of suffixes on the basis of an intuitive notion of the distinction. This is reflected
in the order by which the verbal morphemes will be treated in the subsequent
sections. First I will discuss the most inflexional of the suffixes, the person
cross-reference markers, in (5.1.). Mood (i.e. illocution) markers, which can
also be considered as inflexional, are discussed in (5.2.). Then, more derivational-like morphemes are discussed, such as directional morphemes in (5.3.),
valency changing suffixes in (5.4.), tense, modality and aspect morphemes in
(5.5.) and nominalisers in (5.6.).
Even though negation in Kwaza can be considered as a verbal derivational
process, I have, because of its special formal and pragmatic characteristics,
relegated it to (7.1.).
I regard those roots as verbal which are morphologically bound. From the
point of view of morphology, Kwaza verbs are not complete words if a nominaliser, or person and mood marking is absent. In essence, “incomplete” stems
are not well-formed in Kwaza. Nevertheless, ellipsis of person and mood
marking occurs in certain contexts. This is discussed in another chapter, in
(7.5.).
Semantically, verbal roots are either attributive or predicative. Kwaza verb
roots contrast morphologically with noun roots in that Kwaza nouns can occur

of “agreement” or “concord”.","[278, 279, 280, 281]"

8.6.2. Explicative
The verb root nãi- ‘to be like’/’to do thus’ has an abstract semantic content, and
can be used as a dummy verb in all situations where it is clear from the narrative or pragmatic context what it means:
(3738)'nãi-cwa-ta
'nãi-wa-hͿ-herejã-re
like-IS-NOM-APPL-INT
like-IS-CSO
‘that’s how it happened to him’ (that’s how he fared)Medial clauses often function as a complement of reason in cosubordination
with the matrix clause. If the matrix predicate is based on the verb root nãi- ‘to
be like’/’to do thus’, the construction V-CSO nãi- ‘it is because V’ is used in the
discourse to inform about or to explain the background to a certain situation.
Consider the following little dialogues:
(3739)Q: ti-'nãi-tja

‘how did it happen to him?’A: hy'ja-ta 'nãi-ki

‘because I’m going for a walk’The verb root can also be the first member of a compound. In that case the second member explicitates the background:
(3741)ho'hͿ-xa-ta
nãi=tsasi-'he-xa-re
like=follow-NEG-2-INT
shy-2-CSO
‘you don’t come with us because you are shy?’8.6.3. Indignant
There are several emphatic constructions which express indignation over the
fact that the hearer is not aware of something. The most important ones involve
the interrogative mood and the verb jã- ‘to be’ and were discussed in8.6. Specific constructions711(5.5.14.3.). The construction discussed here also involves clefting use of jã-.
Furthermore, it may contain emphatic use of the interrogative, a switch reference construction, an embedded cosubordinative construction, and the verb
nãi- ‘to be like’ often occurs as the matrix predicate root. The entire framework
of this construction can be summarised as:
(3742)V-ta
a-'re=jã-si
'nãi-xa-re
verb-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
‘do you suppose that it is really the case that V?’The verb jãsi ‘it is’ is represented here as cliticised to the preceding one because of the stress pattern. Main stress is on the preceding interrogative marker.
Note that in this construction the preceding verb a're ‘is there?’ is usually pronounced as [ã'4Ӂ] or [Ó'4Ӂ], probably because of the nasality of the subsequent
verb root jã-.
This construction expresses indignation over a presupposition held by the
hearer. Consider the following examples:
(3743)'mİ̘-ta a-'re=jã-si
'nãi-xa-re
hit-CSO exist-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
‘he did not hit me, no!’ (S does not want to admit it)

talk-NOM=but
like-2-INT=CSO
‘“why the hell have you come?, mother is not just going to have a
look at you, no!”, she said, “go away!” she said, but...’ (t)
The latter example is from a traditional tale in which a young boy is searching
his mother, but his grandmother warns him, because the mother is likely to kill
the boy upon first sight. Through this construction she emphatically rejects the
boy’s presupposition that the mother will also want to see him.
Not all ingredients of the framework as represented in (3742) are obligatory.
Consider the following examples in which there is no matrix predicate:

heavy-DEC be-NEG-damn-INT be-SWR like-2-INT
‘it is very heavy, I’m telling you!’
(lit. ‘it is heavy: do you perhaps suppose that it bloody isn’t?’)In these constructions, the interrogative marker is used emphatically, and the
negative connotation is not marked overtly in the morphology. In a way, the
interrogative marker expresses strong negation, and the literal translation of
(3745) is not entirely realistic. Although these constructions may have a negative value, no negative morpheme is involved unless the element -si should be
related to negative -hͿsi (see 7.1.3.), and should not represent a switchreference marker. However, there is no formal reason to assume that there is
morphologically marked negation here:

does not have to be present at all:416.One does not normally want to admit it if one is in pain.","[747, 748, 749, 750]"
"ParticlesClauses in Kwaza are mostly linked by bound morphemes. Coordination of
clauses is usually expressed by cosubordinative mood marking. However, there
are three conjunctional clause-linking particles. In the present section the frequently occurring successional particle tana ‘then’ and the rare selective particle hele ‘or’ are discussed. The concessive particle wara ‘but’ occurs only as a
clitic to a nominalised clause and is treated in (8.2.2.3.). The linking properties
of the particle hehͿ'si ‘then’ are more oriented on the discourse.
Besides conjunctional particles, there are a number of interjections and exclamative elements, such as kwy ‘yecch!’. They do not modify or link constituents. Only the hesitation particle haryky ‘now, uhh..’ may be said to link sec7.7. Particles597tions of the discourse, since it is used to fill up pauses between them. Finally,
some particles occur often as minimal expressions or responses.
7.7.1. Successional tana ‘then’
The particle tana ‘well, now, then’ occurs much in running narrative. It serves
to sum up successive events without expressing the nature of the relationship
between the events, such as causation, explicitly. Notice the following text excerpt:

‘I drank and drank (the whole night) until I passed out’The relation between cause and effect in the above example is not symbolised
by tana, but it is part of our knowledge of the world. In the following example,
something strange and unexpected happens:
(3187)wãwͿi-'nã-tsy-hͿ=wara

‘and she went to sleep, but early in the night she looked outside, but there
was a jaguar!, then it was approaching over the yard’ (t)
In this example, the unexpectedness is expressed by the concessive element
=wara. Again, tana merely links the successive events.
7.7.2. Tail-head linking hehӻsi ‘well’
As will be demonstrated in (8.3.2.3.1.) the switch-reference mood marker -si is
used not only to indicate discontinuity of the grammatical function of subject
across the sentence, but also to resume continuity or to indicate discontinuity of
pragmatic aspects of the preceding utterances. It seems that this function led to
a new particle, hehͿ'si ‘well, then, in that case’. One possible analysis is that
this particle has developed out of a combination of the switch reference mood
marker -si and the semantically relatively empty verb stem ehͿ- ‘make, do’.
(3188)e=ehͿ-'sie'nãi-tja-ta=da-hͿ-ki
quarrel-TRA-CSO=1S-NOM-DEC
‘he did (what he was not supposed to do) so I quarreled with him’
RED=make-SWRUnder another, more attractive analysis the particle is a semi-lexicalised combination of -he- ‘NEG’, -hͿ- ‘NOM’ and -si ‘SWR’, which has developed out of
an elliptic construction (see also 7.5.), such as:
(3189)jere'xwa axe-'hͿ-hata-he-hͿ-'si
o'nİ-e-tsy-'tse
jaguar find-NOM-3S.2O-NEG-NOM-SWR return-again-POT-DEC
‘because jaguar saw you he will return again (to grab you)’
(lit. ‘he did not just see you, he will return for you’)7.7. Particles599Whatever the analysis, the pragmatic use of hehͿsi or ehͿsi ‘well’ resembles
“Tail-head linking” devices such as witnessed by De Vries (1989:204) in certain Papuan languages. Note the following elliptic example in a dialogue:
(3190)Q: ja
ja-xa-re

‘did you already eat?’A: danͿ ja-'he-da-ki
still eat-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I have not yet eaten’C: he-hͿ-'si
ja-'ra
NEG-NOM-SWR eat-IMP
‘well then (since (you) didn’t), eat!’
As will also be shown in (8.3.2.3.1.), the elliptic particle can still bear person
marking:
(3191)R: he'?ai-da-'ki=tja
y'ro=nãi-le-dy-ta
not.want-1S-DEC=CSO cry=like-only-DS-CSO
‘“I dont want to (go)” he said, crying like that’

2-NEG-NOM-SWR hide-2O.FUT-1S-DEC=CSO talk-CSO
‘“well O.K. then (if you don’t want to go away), I’m going to hide
you” she said’ (t)The combination 'xahehͿ'si was even translated once in isolation by the consultant as ‘so you’, or ‘thus’. Both the meaning of the examples and the position of the optional second person marker suggest that -he- concerns the counter of a supposition rather than the negation of an event (see also 7.1.1.2.).
About the following example, the consultant explained that it is uttered “when
one at first did not want to go, but suddenly decided to go after all”:
(3192)'he-hͿ-si
hͿ'dİ
NEG-NOM-SWR
go!
‘well then, let’s go!’7.7.3. Selective hele ‘or’
The particle hele ‘or’, was only attested in the following examples:
(3193)barerini'tİ 'ja-da-tsy-re

rice

'hele wã'wͿi-da-tsy-tehere
or
sleep-1S-POT-APPR
hunt-1S-POT-APPR
‘either I will go hunting or I will go to sleep’Note that accent is on the ultimate syllable when the particle is elicited in isolation: [he'le] ‘or’. It could be that hele derives etymologically from a combination of negative -he- with preconditional -lİ.
7.7.4. Hesitation particle haryky ‘uhh..’
The adverb haryky ‘now, then’, which is dealt with in (6.1.), may also function
as a hesitation particle, equivalent to English ‘uhh...’:
(3195)a'wy-e-hͿ
eto'hoi
get-again-NOM childawy-'ki=cwa-ki

‘cut hair, uhh, when we are first secluded they cut one’s hair and we
have a bald head, being secluded for a long time’As an alternative to haryky in the hesitation function, the following expression
is also possible:
(3197)ti-nãi-hͿ-ki
what-NOM-NOM-DEC
‘ehh..’ (hesitation)7.7. Particles6017.7.5. Impressive tsİh ‘why!’
The interjectional particle tsİh ‘why!’ is a way to express that one is impressed
or surprised at something.347 Especially members of family I, where the native
language was transferred via a woman, considered the interjection as rude and
said it was a masculine expression not used by women. The feminine equivalent is said by them to be o or nãiko'rİ. In family II, where the native language
is inherited via an old man, everyone used it frequently. Here is an example:
(3198)a'we-ki [pause] tsİh
why!
rain-DEC .......
‘it rained (a lot), wow!’One consultant of family I used it to mark the end of his autobiographical story:
(3199)'a-da-nãi
ͿhͿ'ko ͿhͿ'ko hã'rã hary'ky tsİh
here
stop now
why!
exist-1S-NOM here
‘my life is here, enough, uhh.. that’s it’ (t)A similar particle in Aikanã is used both by men and women: kİh.
7.7.6. Exclamative kukui ‘wow!’
As an exclamative particle, kukui means ‘wow!, Jesus!, how strange!, yecch!”.
It is used in a fixed type of expression involving an interrogative matrix clause:
(3200)ku'kui 'nã-re
wow!
stink-INT
‘yecch! what a stench!’(3201)ku'kui a'xy
wai'hͿ-re
wow!
house
nice-INT
‘wow! that’s a beautiful house’(3202)ku'kui mãrİ̘'?a pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nãi huru'ja-re
wow!
spirit
speak-NOM like-INT
‘my, the Westerner loves to talk a lot!’(3203)ku'kui a'sa-ta-re
wow!
leave-1O-INT
‘what a pity she left me!’kukui originates probably from an elliptic occurrence of the verb root kukui- ‘to
hurt’. The consultant notes that there is no direct relation between the two.
On one occasion, kukui was abbreviated to ku:
347.In Portuguese usually translated as puxa! or nossa senhora!.","[634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639]"
"5887. Other morphosyntactic structuresthis phenomenon as “degrammaticalisation” also in (5.5.15.) and in van der
Voort (2002a).
Cliticisation of verbal inflexion to nouns was dealt with in (4.4.9.) as zeroverbalisation. Verbal inflexion of adverbs, just means that they also function as
semantically attributive verb roots. Nouns may sometimes also be used as adverbs. One special instance of verbalisation of such an adverb was discussed in
(6.2.4.1.), example (2699).
7.5.2.4. Abstract ellipsis
About elliptic responses as discussed in (7.5.2.1.), one could say that the specific root is physically absent but that it is understood, and identifiable from the
context. About quoted speech as discussed in (7.5.2.3.) one could maintain that
a verb root of speech was deleted. However, most quoted speech constructions
would be ungrammatical without such deletion, because it would result in juxtaposition of matrix clause predicates. Finally, it seems that the resumptive use
of inflexions as discussed in (7.5.2.2.) does not involve easily identifiable
omitted verb roots at all. In the present subsection I will discuss some root
omissions which may be even more abstract.
In section (8.2.2.3.) concessive adverbial clause constructions involving the
subordinator =wara ‘but’ are discussed. This element is always preceded by a
nominaliser, usually -hͿ. The nominaliser is normally preceded by the verbal
root of the adverbial clause predicate. However, the morphological complex
-hͿ=wara can also occur independently, as a concessive conjunctional particle,
forming a link between sentences or sections of the discourse. Although this is
also amply illustrated in (8.2.2.3.) I will give an example of it here:
(3151)oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse
go-COMIT-1S-POT-DECzezƭju-dy-'rjͿ
hͿ=wara
Zezinho-POS-DC:area NOM=buthe'?ai -da-ki
want.not-1S-DEC
‘we are going together to Zezinho, but I don’t want to, no’
The same abstract kind of ellipsis was observed in quoted speech constructions, when the verbal root of the quoted phrase was omitted. Compare the
following examples from (8.1.2.2.):
(3152)la'to
'masiju kukuihͿ-da-'ki-tsy-hͿ-ki
yesterday Marcio ill-1S-DEC-GER-NOM-DEC
‘yesterday, Marcio said he is ill’7.5. Morphological ellipsis(3153)589tsy-'hͿ-kiGER-NOM-DEC‘he says yes / he says so’
Example (3153) can be used as if tsy- were a verb root meaning ‘to say’ or a
third person singular cross-reference morpheme. It may be an elliptic version of
(3311), but it may apparently also function as a response to questions like ‘was
Marcio ill yesterday?’:
(3154)la'to
tsicwata
'masiju kukui'hͿ-hͿ-re
yesterday begin-CSO Marcio ill-NOM-INT
‘did Marcio become ill yesterday?’(3155)tsy-'hͿ-ki
GER-NOM-DEC
‘he says so / it is said’344
The same situation exists with respect to the following examples:
(3156)tsy-'nãixwa-wa-kiGER-SIMU-IS-DEC‘they pretend to be talking’(3157)'tse-cwa-kiDEC-IS-DEC‘it is said (that...)’Speech quotations can be extended also with further morphology, e.g. the frustrative morpheme -le- (see 8.2.2.2.). Compare the following examples:
(3158)haru'wi 'ja-a-tsy-'tse-tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
Luiz
eat-1P-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
‘Luiz invited us for dinner, now what to do?’ (it isn’t possible)(3159)tsy-'le-hͿ-ki
GER-FRUST-NOM-DEC
‘he said that; however, unfortunately I can’t’, ‘what a pity’Example (3159) is the elliptic version of (3158), but it can also be uttered for
example as an elliptic response to someone saying ‘Luiz invited us to eat!’, as
if it were a lamentative predicate itself.
Also other morphemes, such as repetitive -je?e- ‘again’ and negative -hefollowed by person and mood marking can occur elliptically, without there being a specific verb root which is understood:
(3160)je'?e-wa-si
again-IS-SWR
‘they explained again’, ‘they did it again’ (etc.)344.Although the consultant added that hͿ'?Ϳ ‘yes’ would have been a better answer.","[625, 626, 627]"

hit-1SO-MON
‘don’t you hit me!’ (‘take
care not to let me be hit!’?)To a great extent the monitory -tsi can also be regarded as a negative
equivalent of the exhortative -ni. Their contrast is highlighted by the following
minimal pair:
(1513)jere'xwa ja-'ni
jaguar eat-EXH
‘let the dog eat!’(1514)jere'xwa ja-'tsi
jaguar eat-MON
‘don’t let the dog eat!’The monitory has nearly the same formal characteristics in being inflexionable
for the same subject persons. The monitory certainly differs from the exhortative in that it can be combined with second person singular subject crossrerefence too, as attested by example (1504).
The monitory is probably a matrix verb mood. The imminence of danger
can be explicitly connected with a preventive measurement in the form of an
imperative or negative imperative verb phrase:
(1515)ku'ri-ca-ra
janãnãi-'tsi
quiet-EMP-IMP good-MON
‘take care, shut your mouth, otherwise you will be eaten up!’196(1516)magariDa-'wã du'ru=wady-ra tã'lo-tsi

‘pour Margarida (tea) lest she will sulk, lest she will quarrel!’(1517)e'nãi-he-ky
bui-'tsi
quarrel-NEG-NEI leave-MON
‘don’t quarrel lest he will leave!’These preventive verb phrases are in matrix verb moods too. Therefore, these
complex clauses probably do not represent grammatically hypotactic constructions. When there is no such preventive complement clause, the monitory
phrase has an implicit preventive value itself. So bui'tsi will probably mean literally: ‘(if you don’t do something) he will leave!’. In this way it has an implicit negative connotation, and as such the monitory mood can be argued to
belong to the prohibitive moods inventorised in (5.2.10.) below.
196.To a noisy cock beneath the house interrupting the current fieldwork session.","[362, 363]"
"7.1. Negation525‘think that, but’, -cehere ‘think that maybe’ and -here=jã-re ‘don’t you see!’
have an antithetic connotation. All these morphemes may contain the original
negative morpheme -he-, but because they do not really have a negative value,
they are discussed in the relevant sections of (5.5.).
7.1.1.3. Negation under nominalisation
The canonical negative occurs also in nominalised verbs, without serious consequences for its meaning:

‘I saw the cup which did not break’299The countersupposition construction, however, is not so predictable when
nominalised. Compare the following non-nominalised examples, the difference
between which is difficult to establish since they were elicited out of context:
(2788)kui-'he-(c)wa-ki
drink-NEG-IS-DEC
‘he did not drink’(2789)'kui-wa-he-ki
drink-IS-NEG-DEC
‘he is not drinking’The fact that example (2788) does not involve countersupposition, is suggested
by its nominalised equivalent:
(2790)kui-'he-cwa-hͿ
drink-NEG-IS-NOM
‘that (stuff) which he didn’t drink’However, the “nominalised” version of (2789) is neither analysed formally nor
semantically as a negative construction (nor as a nominalised construction, for
that matter):
(2791)'kui-wa-hehͿ

Apparently, the repetitive morpheme -e- ‘too’ (see 4.4.6.) or ‘again’ (see
5.5.31.) can also be interpreted as ‘neither’ when it occurs on an argument of a
negative verb. Compare the following examples with one another:

attached to either constituent of the habitual complement construction:

in example (1502). There the grammatical subject is cross-referenced explicitly

example is (like the former) not “controlled” by the subject, whereas the verb
root of the negative imperative phrase is. In fact, the subject is the very same
second person singular in both members of the paratactic construction.194 However, monitory verbs can also have second person subjects when they are controllable verbs. This construction has a negative imperative connotation. Compare the following two examples:192.This sentence is probably a calque on the POR expression: nãõ deixe ele tomar olho,
lit. ‘don’t let him take(=drink) eye!’ (the Portuguese verb tomar means both ‘to take’
and ‘to drink’).

"3.2. Types of morphemes97Note that in Kwaza, reduplication is not only defined by phonotactic
boundaries, i.e. it does not exclusively concern reduplication of roots or syllables. Also certain bound morphemes such as person markers can be reduplicated, as a special grammatical means to express aspectual and temporal differences. This is discussed in section (7.3.).
The different types of morphemes in Kwaza are listed in the table below:

Within the word, the facultative derivational morphemes occur basically between the root on the left and the inflexions on the right. The example below
shows the canonical relative position of morphemes inside the noun and the
verb:
(27) atxitxi'mu
kui'nãxare
atxitxi-mu
kui-nã-xa-re
drink-FUT-2-INT
maize-CL:liquid
Noun-Classifier

ROOT-DERIVATION
ROOT-DERIVATION-INFLEXION-INFLEXION
‘do you want to drink maize chicha?’ (HYPOTETICAL EXAMPLE)
Although much more research still has to be done with regard to morpheme positions, it is possible to make a few general statements.
In nouns, the first morpheme is usually the obligatory noun root. Thereafter
derivational morphemes may follow, such as possessive and attributive. In the
subsequent positions classifiers or a nominaliser or other derivational morphemes may occur. If relevant, the noun may be terminated by an object argument case or oblique case inflexion. The obligatory slots are in bold print:

Thereafter optional derivational morphemes follow, such as directional, classifier, attributive, tense, modality, aspect, valency change, object person and
negative morphemes, more or less in that order. Thereafter come the obligatory
subject person and the word-final mood inflexions. In certain constructions,
derivational elements such as the negative morpheme and a tense, modality or
aspect morpheme occur between the person and mood inflexions.

for morpheme slots in specific constructions such as compounds, reduplication,
quotation and certain others.

preventive function. However in the following elliptic form it does have a
monitory connotation:
(2842)ƭ-'tsi-da-ta
NEG-MON-1S-CSO
‘therefore I didn’t want to’This phrase can be uttered as a reaction when someone did something against
the advice of the speaker, and made a mess of it. Probably, it represents a quotative construction. In fact, the combination ƭ-tsi- could alternatively be regarded as a verb root with the sense of ‘to warn’:

‘I already warned them and told them so clearly, however, because
they didn’t listen they all died’ (t)Maybe ƭtsi has become a separate particle in this position, meaning ‘in vain’,
‘wrong(ful)ly’, ‘just like that’ or ‘without reason’. Under that analysis, e.g.
(2840) should be read as ‘why are you angry with him just like that?’ and example (2841) as ‘why do you stay away for no reason?’.
One type of construction, which was rarely encountered, was not well understood. The only attested examples are the following:5367. Other morphosyntactic structures(2844)oja-'ra-ƭsi o'ja-da-hͿ-ki
go-IMP-??? go-1S-NOM-DEC
‘he ordered to go, so I went’(2845)'nãi-ƭsi 'nãi-da-hͿ-ki
like-??? like-1S-NOM-DEC
‘he said thus and so I did’The first clause in example (2844) reminds of a subordinate clause which constitutes a quotative construction involving -si as a switch reference marker. The
first clause in example (2845) looks like an ordinary subordinated verb. However, the element -ƭ- is strange. It does not seem to be a negative marker, and it
is probably neither a morphophonological variant nor a mistake for the attributive morpheme -Ϳ-. It is also very unlikely that -ƭ- represents the third person
pronoun, since pronouns never occur in that position. If one were to accept that
explanation, one could take the argument also a step further and claim that -sirepresents the first person pronoun, which is just as unlikely. Another, more
likely explanation is that -si is another pronunciation of the monitory marker
-tsi. In section (2.14.) phoneme fluctuation between /s/ and /ts/ was attested.
This is confirmed by an alternative pronunciation of the first word of (2840) as
ti'nãi?ƭ'si ‘why? (would you do that, don’t)’. If this is also the case in (2844)
and (2845), they could be interpreted respectively as ‘he just ordered (me) to go
so I went’ and ‘just because he (said) it, I did it’. Example (2816) and the following should probably be interpreted in a similar manner:

‘I’m not going to eat mango with honey, or else I’ll (just) get ill’The following idiomatic type of construction is a kind of clefted negative
reason clause:

‘what is he coming after us for?, no way he is thinking of working, so
what does he want?’ (t)The preconditional morpheme -lİ seems to be part of this fixed expression.
The element -ƭ- may also explain part of an alternative negative exhortative
mood form -ini, which occurs in a limited set of expressions. This is dealt with
in (5.2.8.).","[572, 573, 574]"

marker, why then is this the only situation in which the third person is not zeromarked? And the examples seem to provide no reason to consider -tsy- as an
allomorph of declarative -tse used to indicate reported speech. The following
examples of a preconditional construction show the same dilemma as regards
-tsy- in the adverbial clause.

(see 8.2.2.1.).
8.2.1.4. Chaining of conditional clauses
An “open” conditional sentence is formed through the chaining of an in principle infinite number of coordinated conditional antecedent phrases each ending
in the conditional verbal marker -kywy subordinated to a sentence-final consequent matrix clause that contains an potential/future verbal morpheme -tsy-, or
an irrealis condition morpheme -rydy-. Other conditional phrases ending in -lİ363.Note that the position of the negation morpheme -he- in this and the subsequent two
examples indicates a counter of presupposition (see 7.1.1.)6388. Subordination and coordinationmay apparently be subordinated or embedded both in antecedents or in consequents.

There are several types of expressions with semantic values which approach
the concessive. They often involve the same morphological elements -lİ, -tsyand -hͿ again, which have been attested with widely different functions
throughout the grammar of Kwaza. It may be that these recurring morphemes
which are hard to identify acquire a specific meaning in particular constellations and order of elements, and that these constellation types themselves must
be regarded as lexicalised with a certain meaning.
The “canonical” concessive, which will be discussed first, involves an adverbial clause ending in -lete. The next concessive construction is formed by
-lehͿ and has a frustrative connotation. The last concessive dealt with is formed
by -(hͿ)=wara and has a coordinating function.","[674, 675, 676]"
"The verb root jã- ‘to be’The verb root jã- ‘to be’ has many uses, and they were discussed in several
places throughout the present work. Because of its manifold functions and its
diverging distribution, I have briefly summarised all its uses here.
As the root of an independent predicate, jã- ‘to be’ is used as an affirmative
expression:
(2973)jã-'ki
be-DEC
‘that’s it!’, ‘that’s correct’, ‘that’s how it’s done!’Example (2973) is used, for instance, in a teaching situation. The next example
represents an utterance by which the speaker solicits confirmation:
(2974)jã-'re
be-INT
‘that’s the way (one does it)?’Here are some other examples of jã-:
(2975)jã-'wy
be-time
‘still’ (lit. ‘the time of (being) like that’)(2976)ti-'nãi
jã-'re
what-NOM be-INT
‘how is it you do it?’, ‘how is it you said?’These expressions are all quite dependent on the pragmatic context.
In a number of instances, jã- ‘to be’ was used in the sense of ‘to say’:
(2977)jere'xwa 'jã-hͿ=wara
jaguar be-NOM=but
‘saying “jaguar”, but’ (t)(2978)(2979)tsǊhǊ-ra'ti-wã jari'mã jã-'re

bring-REF-EMP-IMP be-NOM-RES
‘(I’m) telling you bring here the pan!’ (ordering again)557A: di'ra jã-'ki
dira be-DEC
‘it is “dira”’In the above examples, jã- nevertheless continues to be literally interpretable as
‘to be’.
The verb root jã- ‘to be’ is used mostly in various types of fixed compound
expressions. In (5.5.14.3.) it was discussed in combination with the appellative
conjectural morpheme -here. As demonstrated in (7.2.10.), it has an emphatic
effect in combination with exclamative -tady. Finally, in (8.6.3.) it is dealt with
as part of a special construction with an indignant function. In some of these
constructions, it is difficult to establish whether the element jã- is truly a cliticised verb root. Sometimes, namely, it resembles a cross-reference morpheme.
Compare the following examples:
(2982)areta-'he-damͿ-tsy-hͿ-ta'dͿ=jã-ki
know-NEG-want-GER-NOM-EXCL=be-DEC
‘ah, he is not going to learn (to speak Kwaza), no way!’(2983)areta-'he-damͿ-tsy-hͿ-ta'dy-da-ki
know-NEG-want-GER-NOM-EXCL-1S-DEC
‘ah, he is not going to learn (to speak Kwaza), no way!’These examples were said by the consultant to be identical in meaning. It is
interesting to note that the element =jã- ‘to be’ is in the same position as
cross-reference marker -da-. However, one may presume that the grammatical
structure of the examples is different, and that jã- represents a sort of dummy
verb, which is compounded with the preceding utterance, whereas the first person marker -da- is applied after zero-verbalisation. In both examples, that
which follows -tady has an emphatic function. In the following examples, the
same contrast can be observed twice:
(2984)e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi=jã-'ta
areta-'nã=jã-ki
know-FUT=be-DEC
quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON=be-CSO
‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore we’re going to learn’(2985)e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-'ta
areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki
quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON-2-AS-CSO know-FUT-2-AS-DEC
‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore you’re going to learn’5587. Other morphosyntactic structuresAgain, jã- occurs in (2984) in the same position as the person marker in (2985).
However, here there is a semantic difference. When one compares the translations, the element jã- seems to indicate a first person plural. Note from the
comparison of the following examples how jã- appears to agree only with a
first person plural inclusive cross-reference marker in the matrix clause:
(2986)tsǊhǊ-'du=jã-lİ
'nãi-a-tsy-re (*nãi-da-tsy-re)

'nãi-xa-tsy-re
like-2-POT-INT
what-BER-2-PREC
‘what are you going to do that for?’Note also about (2986) that the inclusive morpheme -a- cannot be replaced by
another cross-reference morpheme. The same kind of “agreement” differences
were encountered in the contrast between the examples (2080) and (2081) in
(5.5.12.). In many examples in section (5.5.12.) which involve the element jãin a position where one would expect a cross-reference morpheme, the translations suggest that the subject is impersonal323. Compare the following examples, and note their approximate literal translations:
(2989)ti-nãi-da-'te-xa-ta

(lit. ‘it is for us to (say) “we show it to people”‘)323.In most Portuguese translations the subject was expressed as a gente, literally ‘the
people’, but which is an impersonal way to talk about the first person plural ‘one,
people (including me)’.","[594, 595, 596]"
"7.1. Negation537Finally, there is a verb root i'hƭ- ‘contrary’ of which the first syllable resembles the negative element. It has a somewhat contrastive connotation which will
last into the near future:
(2849)i'hƭ-ki
contrary-DEC
‘on the contrary’, ‘wait!’, ‘no!’, ‘it is not like that!’This root also combines with the negative imperative element -ky in an alternative negative exhortative expression which pertains to a somewhat remote future. This was discussed in (5.2.7.). Furthermore, ihƭ- was encountered (as
[ƭhƭ]) in the following construction with the sense of ‘continue’, ‘for the coming time’:
(2850)cwa-ra'ti=ihƭ-rai-reIS-FOC=contrary-damn-INT‘it is like that they continue hereafter’
It can even be combined with the negative morpheme -he-:
(2851)a-'he=ihƭ-tsy-hͿ
exist-NEG=contrary-POT-NOM
‘there won’t (be a recording session tomorrow, only later)’ (t)Because this morpheme involves the notion of tense or aspect it is discussed
further in (5.5.28.). The next example combines -ƭ- with -he- but it may just as
well have been -ihƭ- pronounced rapidly:
(2852)hako're
'saBaDo
'hehͿsi a-'he-ƭ-tsy-re
(t)
tomorrow Saturday
well
exist-NEG-NEG-POT-INT
‘tomorrow is Saturday, therefore there won’t be (recording for now)?’7.1.3. The negative habitual element -hӻsi
There is a rare verbal negative element -hͿsi. It replaces the mood marker and
has a negative value. It acts as a “negative mood” inflexion with a connotation
of permanence. Compare the following examples:
(2853)atsuka-'ko kui-'nãi
'e-da-hͿ-he-'ki
sugar-INS drink-NOM have-1S-NOM-NEG-DEC
‘I don’t drink coffee with sugar’5387. Other morphosyntactic structures(2854)ka'wİ
atsuka-'ko 'kui-da-hͿsi
coffee sugar-INS drink-1S-NEG
‘I don’t drink coffee with sugar anyway’The first example, which represents a habitual construction, can be uttered in a
context where the hearer was not able to offer sugar. In the second example, the
hearer declares that he is not willing to provide sugar. Note that the second example apparently also has a habitual sense. Compare the following examples:
(2855)'mã
e-'he-da-ta
ere'ri-da-ki
mother have-NEG-1S-CSO grow-1S-DEC
‘I grew up without a mother’(2856)mã
'e-da-ta
ere'ri-da-hͿ'si
mother have-1S-CSO grow-1S-NEG
‘I grew up without a mother’ (t)In both examples the speaker grew up in permanent absence of a mother. The
following examples also transpire the sense of permanent absence:
(2857)'a-da-hͿsi
(2858)
exist-1S-NEG
‘I lived alone/without parents’
(lit. ‘I’m not at home’)ere'ri-a-hͿsi

(t)
exist-NEG kill-IO-POT-INT=CSO talk-IS-SWR
‘“he’s lying, from where would a big tree be smashing us?” they said’Apparently, the morpheme -hͿsi indicates negative habituality, or the fact that a
negative situation lasts for some time. The final example is not entirely incompatible with this interpretation:
(2861)mani'ni-tsumãi 'e-a-ta
fish-CL:point have-1P-CSOǊmã'tİ-a-hͿsi

lose-1S-NOM-INS
‘I did not fish using a hook, because I lost the hook’313
The element -si as part of the negative permanence marker cannot be confused
with the homophonous switch reference marker -si since the latter does not require a preceding element -hͿ-, and does not have a negative value.

ruining (things) of mine’.
rawy- (V-stem) waggle
Reduplicated in: ra'wyra'wytse /
'rawy'wytse/ki ‘(the dog) waggles (its)
tail’.
rãmã- (V-stem) shake, tremble, rattle,
reel, dangle
Note
reduplication
in
most
occurrences: rãmã'mãki ‘it is reeling,
swaying (on her head)’, ‘it dangles
(hanging down and it may drop any
second)’, rãmã'mãdaki ‘I’m shaking
(him)’, rãmãmã'dydaki ‘I’m making
him/it shake’, rãmãmã'nͿdaki ‘I’m
trembling’, ramãra'mãtse ‘it is rattling
(because it is loose)’.
-re (svv) INT
Verbal interrogative mood ending of
the matrix clause. The third person
singular subject is zero-marked.
Sometimes [rİ]. tsuhǊra'ti hurujaxa'redaki ‘I don’t know what you want’.
The interrogative can also be used
emphatically: ku'kui ñãsi'heda're
‘damn, I can’t hear anything!’, ku'kui914Dictionarykara'ra?Ϳre ‘gosh, he is meagre!’.
rİ?Ǌce- (V) lean, slant, tilt
a'xy 'rİ?Ǌceki ‘the house is tilted’.
RED in: rİrİrİ'rİ?Ǌceki ‘he is walking
while leaning over forward (nearly
falling over)’.
-ri (CL) flat
E-noun. e'ri ‘paddle, liver, field,
piranha’. koreja'ri nͿ'riki ‘plate is big’.
Probably related to -xuri- ‘chest’.
-ri- (DR) up-down
This morpheme may be lexicalised in
the verb roots o'ri- ‘to ascend’, di'ri‘to descend’ and tu'ri- ‘to topple’. It is
possibly productive in towİ'ri- ‘to
ascend (PLS)’, and may be the same
element in awe'riki ‘it is raining’ (had
just begun, or it is going to).
-ri- (svv) ???
This rare morpheme is not well
understood and its productive application is rejected by MA. It may be a
directional, classifying or TMA-like
morpheme obsolete in family I.
awe'riki ‘it is raining’ (had just begun,
or it is going to). Note Z:203: êtsêre-kí
‘die’, which may be explained as
isi(ri)ki ‘he dies’, or ‘he grabs (his
chest)’. It is lexicalised (and accepted
by MA) in tokoi'ri- ‘be tired’ and in
'tãiki ‘it is hard’ vs. tãi'riki ‘it does not
die easily, it has a durable life (e.g. a
tortoise, which is difficult to kill)’.
-rihi (CL) flat oval seed
E-noun. eri'hi ‘flat oval seed’, e.g. of
calabash seeds (also kudyri'hi), pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, beans.
riki- (V) tighten knob
ri'kiki ‘he is tightening the knob (e.g.
when switching on the radio, tv etc.)’.
-rilo (CL) jaw
E-noun. erilo'na kukui'hͿdaki or
kukuiri'lodaki ‘I have pain in the jaw’.
erilo'xu ‘jawbone’. Contains probably
the CL -ri ‘flat’ and -lo ‘tube’.
rilo- (V-etym) stagger
Usually reduplicated: rilo'lodaki ‘I’m
staggering (because of alcohol, or a hit
on the head)’, 'rilo'rilo""lohyhy'rwa‘(he) walked staggering (after being
shot, half falling as if drunk)’.
rirwa- (V/CL/DR) round
ri'rwa?ͿratihͿ'ko
ha'biwata
aru'ce'wahͿhe'rejãre ‘they light fire
with that round stuff (inside the
mortar), and put (chicha) into it, isn’t
it?’. Related to eri'rwa ‘circle’. As a
CL or DR: eri'rwa nͿri'rwaki ‘big
circle’. tiri'rwa ‘which circle (are you
thinking of)?’.
rirwahoro- (V) draw a circle
ri'rwaho'roki ‘he made (something)
round’. The second part is probably
related to horo- ‘to finish’ or ‘to cut’.
-ritsa- (DR) outside
jãsixareri'tsadaki ‘I heard it from
(there) outside (the house)’. As a result
of productive adverb formation: ari'tsa
a'wͿidaki cohasi'ki ‘I saw a shoe
outside’. Lexicalised in tsiri'tsa
‘middle’. Occurs also in lexicalised
combinations such as eritsa'mjã ‘place,
camp’.
-ritsu (CL) flat thin wood
E-noun. eri'tsu ‘flat thin wood’, e.g. of
adventitious roots of certain trees, and
the wooden butt of a rifle. ywy'nwͿri'tsu ‘flat adventitious root of a tree’.

mouth, i.e. opening of
mouth
E-noun. eri'ce ‘hole of the mouth’.
-ricwa (CL) inhabited place, house(s)
E-noun. eri'cwa ‘inhabited place (a
group of settlements / houses + yards
inside the same clearing in the forest,
i.e. a village)’, derives probably from
e'ri ‘field’ + -xwa ‘human’. İ'ja
txanaricwa'na ‘let’s go to our town’,
dukyri'cwa
‘other
settlement’,
aweri'cwaki ‘it rained in town’. Maybe
there is a relation with Tupi-Guarani
(r/t)etam(a) ‘land, town, inhabited
place’ (Willem Adelaar pc).
-rja- (DR/CL)
behind rim or edge,
around
Directional use: hary'ky tsi'cwadata
'tãtãirja'hͿdaki ‘now I started to pound
around’ (pound the earth around poles2. Kwaza-English vocabulary

-rjana (CL) thigh, rim of the groin
E-noun: 'İr(i)ja'nã ‘thigh, rim of the
groin’. kukuirja'nadaki ‘I have a pain
in my thigh’. This classifier is
lexicalised in erja'nãsiki ‘shorts’.

nͿrja'rweki ‘it is a big wheel’. DR
properties in: burja'rwedaki ‘I put it
around’, towİrja'rwewata ‘they rotated
(seminomadically on the move)’. The
element -rwe- is probably related to
the DR -rwİ- ‘around’.
-rjatİ- (DR) rim, side
Consists of -rja- ‘edge, rim’ and
unidentified -tİ. Can be used as an
adverbialiser
itself:
ywynwͿ'ko

-rjӻsİҊ (CL) necklace of shells
Possibly an e-noun: İ̎rjͿ'sİ̎(ni'tİ)
‘necklace of shells’. nͿrjͿ'sİ̎ki ‘it is a

rjӻsİҊtõi?ӻhӻ (N) squint
Refers to someone who squints.
Related to ͅrjͿse'tõi ‘eyelashes’.
-ry- (sxx) PAU
Paucal which refers only to nonvegetal animate entities. Always
followed by a nominaliser. etohoiry'rai
‘those (e.g. my/his) shameless
children’. tala'mİryrai ‘my shameless

-rydy- (svv) IRR
The irrealis condition morpheme
occurs in matrix clauses. It expresses a
counterfactual condition when combined with a medial clause that
contains conditional -kywy, as in:
Ǌce'nãidahͿkywy'ta dai'hedarydyki ‘if
I had known it (e.g. that it was so bad),
I would not have bought it’. In the
same way it may also occur in
concessive constructions. It also occurs
in simple matrix clauses: dilİ 'curydy're ‘who would be able to cut it?’,
wa'dyrydy'hͿki ‘I think that he gave to
you’, ti'nãihͿ'rydy're ‘what do you

-rohaxu (CL) spine
E-noun. ku'kuiroha'xuki ‘he has pain in
the lower back’. It is not attested
whether there is a difference with sexu ‘spine’. Maybe the (now
lexicalised) part -roha- refers to the
hole in the vertebra and represented
originally another way to describe the
spine (see also eroha'xu(xu) ‘spine’
and eroha'kãi ‘canoe hole’).
-rokotay (CL) abdomen

"Morphological ellipsisOne of the basic characteristics of morphology is that it involves bound morphemes. One of the basic properties of bound morphemes is that they do not
occur as independent words. This is confirmed by the fact that when a bound
morpheme of a certain language is presented in isolation to a bilingual native
speaker, it is very difficult for him or her to give an accurate translation if he or
she is not a linguist.330 In the present work I have analysed Kwaza as a morphologically complex language, and its morphology as agglutinative. Morphophonological processes are rare in Kwaza, and quite irregular. Although the
morphology seems agglutinating, the large number of grammatical morphemes
with lexical contents betrays a tendency towards polysynthesis. Notwithstanding this analysis, it can be demonstrated that bound morphemes in Kwaza do
occur independently, be it only in the proper contexts. Furthermore, a number
of morphemes can be interpreted in isolation by some consultants, although the
interpretations of such morphemes may vary strongly, depending on the imagined or suggested context in which they are placed. In van der Voort (2002a) I
have argued that this does not prohibit one to regard Kwaza roots and inflexions as bound morphemes.331
In this section I will discuss elliptic phenomena in Kwaza morphology. I
will not treat here the omission of overt arguments of fully inflected verbs. This
has already been dealt with in section (5.1.) on person cross-reference. Furthermore, I will not discuss here the omission of overt heads of attributive constructions. This is mentioned in sections (4.2.1.3.), (4.3.) and (8.4.1.2.). Finally,
stylistically motivated omission of sentence constituents is not discussed in the
present work at all.
The subject to which I refer as “ellipsis” in the present work is mainly the
omission of verbal inflexion and of roots. It occurs often in pragmatic contexts
where it is obvious to the hearer which elements are to be understood. Certain
aspects of Kwaza grammar, such as the resumptive function of independently
occurring inflexional elements must have originated from ellipsis. In the present section I will give an overview of morphological ellipsis in Kwaza. Several
specific aspects of ellipsis were also touched upon in other places, which will
be mentioned in passing. Negation in elliptic constructions has already been
discussed separately in (7.1.1.5.). Coordination by means of an elliptic con
330.Obviously, this is no less difficult for a linguist who is not a native speaker.
331.In that article I have drawn a parallel with the Eskimo languages on the basis Allen
(1996:15;27;253). Root ellipsis and morpheme ellipsis in Inuktitut is also the topic of
an article by Swift and Allen (2002) that came to my attention afterwards.",[613]
"7.5. Morphological ellipsis581Note with respect to (3126) that the expression of negation under ellipsis was
discussed thoroughly in section (7.1.1.3.). Note also that person cross-reference
markers never occur as elliptic forms by themselves, but that they are always
followed by mood markers. Finally, it should be emphasised that such bound
morpheme sequences only build a phrase by itself in the proper context. Consider the following examples:
(3128)e-'xy
'dai-ty-taxwa-hͿ-ta'dy=jã-ki
Ø-CL:leaf grab-DET-IS.1O-NOM-EXCL=be-DEC
‘without me knowing he took my money but now I discovered it!’(3129)ta'dy=jã-ki
EXCL=be-DEC
‘that’s it indeed!’About (3129), the consultant said that it is ungrammatical as such, but that it
can be uttered after someone told you something which you already know.
The interpretation of elliptic expressions may also depend on more pragmatic, extralinguistic factors of the context. The following utterances represent
a response to the general (speech) behaviour of the hearer:

‘“well then, I will show (him to you)”‘ (t)7.5.2.2. Resumptive particles
In running monologue, combinations of person and cosubordinative mood
marking are sometimes used as resumptive particles. They link sentences, and
they are often translated by consultants as ‘and then, well, I, then I, so I, she,
well you, and thereafter, yes’ etc. Although these “inflected particles” cannot
be regarded as elements which remain when a root is omitted, they are elliptic:5827. Other morphosyntactic structures(3132)xyi-'dy-hͿ

‘because your father killed from me the one loved by me, I don’t
want your one (i.e. father)’336 (t)
Pronouns cannot replace these resumptive elements. About da-ta ‘1S-CSO’ in
the following example, the consultant said “if one would have said si ‘I’, this
would have been too strong, as it would mean ‘I myself’”:

‘I came here when you were away, then, I slept, and went away
again’ (long ago)
All subject persons can occur in resumptive particles, as long as the mood
marker is the cosubordinative:
(3134)e'nãi-tja-ja-tsy-'tse

areta-'nã-a-xa-ki
quarrel-TRA-IO-POT-DEC 1P-AS-CSO know-FUT-1P-AS-DEC
‘he is going to quarrel with one, so we, we’re going to learn’The resumptive particle construction is possibly related to cliticisation, as discussed in (7.5.2.3.), and to quoted speech like constructions, as discussed in
(5.5.11-14.). The monitory mood version of the embedded clause in (3134) results in a “preventive” construction (see 5.2.9.1.):
(3135)e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-ta
areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki
quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON-2-AS-CSO know-FUT-2-AS-DEC
‘for him not to quarrel with us, therefore you’re going to learn’Note that the impersonal subject marker -na- does not occur in resumptive particles or as a clitic. From the comparison of (3135) with the following example,
it becomes clear that this function is taken over by the verb root jã- ‘to be’:337
336.This sentence was uttered by a mother to her son, explaining why she separated from
his father.","[618, 619, 620]"
"Colour termsThere are several colour terms. They are based on semantically attributive verbal roots, and are often derived as attributive nouns (cf. 4.3.2.). Some of the
roots occur obligatorily with the attributive morpheme -Ϳ-. Some roots may occur without the attributive morpheme with a different, though related, meaning.
One of the roots, darahͿ- ‘green’ does not occur without a classifier. They are
listed here:
'be.?Ϳdara'hͿ'ha.?Ϳha'nǊ.?Ϳha'xy?Ϳho'ho.?Ϳ'ki.?Ϳmİ̘'rǊi?Ϳ'weu?Ϳ-‘(very) black’
‘green, unripe’
‘white’
‘brown, grey’
‘yellow, sick’
‘black’
‘red, orange’
‘blue, green’
‘brown, red’'be*dara'haha'nõ*haxyho'ho'ki*mİ̘rǊi*weu-‘ripe, purple’
‘clean’
‘painted grey’
‘dirty, black’
‘ripe’Most of the roots without -Ϳ- are semantically related to the corresponding colour term. In this way ‘black, dark blue’ and ‘dirty’ are associated via the root
element hoho-, ‘white’ and ‘clean’ via ha-, ‘red’ and ‘ripe’ via ki-. The root
element be- associates ‘deep black (dark?)’ with ‘ripe’ and ‘purple’.
It seems that hoho?Ϳ- represents another sort of black than be?Ϳ- does.
These roots both have equivalents in Kanoê where the associations are partially
reversed: the negation of Kanoê bİ- or pİ- ‘clean’ relates to the concepts ‘black,
red, dirty, ripe’, whereas Kanoê woro- seems to mean only ‘black’. Together
with ki- the entire situation can be sketched as in table (35) below. The semantic areas covered by a specific root are shaded by <ŵ>:9.2. Colour terms717Table 35. Association range of colour terms for ‘red’ and ‘black’ in Kwaza and Kanoê

ŵŵŵŵŵŵIt is not unlikely that the terms for ‘dirty’ and ‘black’ in Kwaza and Kanoê are
related to the Kwaza verb root ho- ‘rot’, and/or to Tupi ho or hǊ ‘black, rotten’.
The general root for ‘ripe’ and ‘red’ in Kwaza is ki-, but not only things
which ripen can be called ‘red’: kuronitİ ki?ͿhͿ ‘red door’. Furthermore, kialso covers the colour ‘orange’. The root be- generally means ‘black’. In the
sense of ‘ripe’ be- only refers to the ripeness of certain fruits with a hard shell,
and in the sense of ‘red’ it only refers to a specific dark shade of red: ‘purple’.
Another term for ‘red’ is weu?Ϳ-. However, its general meaning is ‘brown’.
Another term for ‘brown’ is hanǊ?Ϳ-. The difference between the two has not
been established. At any rate, the consultants say that “much of what is red in
Portuguese, is not red in Kwaza”, by which they imply that the word weu?Ϳ‘brown’ is used rather than ki- ‘red’ for shades of colour which would be classified as ‘red’ in Portuguese. Apparently, weu?Ϳ- refers to an intermediary shade
of colour between ki- ‘red’ and hanǊ?Ϳ- ‘brown’.
The word mİ̘'rǊi?Ϳ- means both ‘blue’ and ‘green’. The colour of the sky
can be referred to as mİ̘rǊi?Ϳ-, but shades of green can also be referred to by
this word. In Aikanã, the situation is the same: Aikanã hürürü- is the root for
both ‘blue’ and ‘green’. On another occasion, Kwaza mİ̘rǊi?Ϳ- was used only
for ‘blue’ while the word given for green was darahͿ-. However, darahͿ- may
not really be a colour term. The root darahͿ- usually referred to the colour (or
the state?) of unripe fruit. Note that there are words that are possibly derived
from ‘unripe/green’: darato'hoi ‘baby’ (lit. ‘little young one’); da'rai ‘vermin,
worm’. Note that the meaning ‘unripe’ can also be expressed by a negative
form of ki- ‘ripe’:
(3758)ki-'he-tse
ripe-NEG-DEC
‘it is not ripe’The word for ‘brown’, ha'nǊ?Ϳ- is used by some speakers also for ‘grey’
and even ‘light blue’.418 Note its use for ‘grey’ in the following example:418.Its variant hanõ?Ϳ- was attested only with the meaning ‘grey’.","[754, 755]"
"283MoodMood is obligatorily expressed by a verb-final morpheme. Kwaza has four independent basic moods for the sentential matrix verb: declarative, marked by
-ki or -tse; interrogative, marked by -re; and persuasive and prohibitive. The
persuasive is further divided into three sub-moods, depending on the person involved: imperative, marked by -ra for second persons; exhortative-causative,
marked by -ni for first inclusive and third persons; and volitive, marked by -mͿ
for other first persons. The prohibitive is also divided into three sub-moods:
negative imperative, marked by -ky-; negative exhortative, marked by -(i)ni;
and monitory, marked by -tsi.
Cosubordinated sentences are not overtly marked for these moods, but they
basically get a verb-final general cosubordinate marker -ta or -si the modal
content of which is often determined by the mood of the matrix verb. Cosubordination is discussed in (8.3.). The “mood” markers of adverbial clauses will be
discussed in (8.2.).
It is important to note that without any further morphological or lexical operations, the default tense interpretation of the verb root which is inflected for
person and declarative mood is ambiguous between present and anterior to the
moment of speaking:
(1257)o'nİ-ki
arrive-DEC
‘he arrives / he arrived’Although the default interpretation of the interrogative is also potentially both
present and anterior, there is a stronger tendency for it to be present tense.
In this section, all moods are discussed. Interaction between mood and person marking is discussed where it applies. Some moods other than the declarative require person markers which deviate slightly from the situation sketched
in section (5.1.). They were not dealt with in that section because they are dependent on certain specific moods.
Eight basic mood marking morphemes were identified in Kwaza. In the present section they will be treated in the same order as they appear in the following table.172172.Mood in subordinated verbs is discussed in section (8.2.) on adverbial clauses, and
mood in cosubordinated verbs in section (8.3.) on medial clauses.",[321]

However, the verbalisations by -tse are less obvious. In examples (1315) and

they consist of nouns derived by a nominal suffix; and in examples (1317) and

through further investigation in the field.

in (7.1.1.5.).
The following counter-example, an indentifying zero-verbalisation by -tse,
may find its explanation in the fact that the stem is a personal pronoun:
(1322)'ƭ-tse
he-DEC
‘it was him’A possible counterexample to the hypothesis that -ki does not have an existential function in zero-verbalisation is:5.2. Mood(1323)295darje'mǊ-ki
rapids-DEC
‘there is a rapids in the river’5.2.1.5. -tse and reported speech
One last difference between -ki and -tse should be mentioned here, if only
briefly. Reported speech in Kwaza is expressed by “cliticisation” of person and
mood marking to direct speech utterances which may already be inflected for
person and mood. The cliticised inflexion refers to the person of the reporting
speaker and the mood in which the report is stated. If the reporting speaker is a
third person and his report is stated in the declarative, not -ki is cliticised, but
-tse:
(1324)ojanͿ-da-'ki-Ø-tse
arrive-1S-DEC-3-DEC
‘he said he arrived’ (lit. ‘he said “I arrived”’)This specific quotative construction occurs also in e.g. desiderative and volitional expressions, where the same restrictions hold. Reported speech, desiderative and volitional are the subject of separate sections (5.5.11.; 5.5.13.;
5.2.5.1.). Probably, reported speech may also account for another way in which
zero-verbalisation by cliticisation of -ki may differ from cliticisation of -tse:
(1325)rai?Ϳ'hͿ-ki
(1326) rai?Ϳ'hͿ-tse
animal-DEC
animal-DEC
‘it is an animal/it is a thing’
‘he wants something’
(CX: he came over to ask for e.g. rice)Example (1326) may have a quotative origin and hence mean literally ‘he says
“things”‘ (which would contain an indirect report in this case). This suggests
that there is no real zero-verbalisation going on. Similar pairs were given in
section (4.4.9.) on zero-verbalisation. One indication that this analysis is correct is provided by the respective negative counterparts of these constructions:
(1327)ipİ'pa etay-'he-tse
(1328)
Ipepa woman-NEG-DEC
‘Ipepa is not a woman’ipİ'pa e'tay
he'?ai-tse
Ipepa woman want.not-DEC
‘Ipepa does not want a woman’In (1327) the zero-verbalised root is negated,179 whereas in (1328) an overt
verbal root is used.
179.Note that -tse occurs here because of independent reasons: the negative morpheme
can only be immediately adjacent to -ki in a countersuppositional reading (see2965. The verb phrase5.2.1.6. Possible cognates of -tse
Certain morphemes have been attested which show formal and functional resemblances to the declarative -tse. Consequently, they may be historically related. Here I will treat them only briefly. Together with cosubordinative -tja
there might be an element -tsİ, which plays a role in nominal coordinating constructions. It creates an internally complex noun phrase, which can function as
an argument in the matrix clause:
(1329)kaikǊ'cͅ-tja
arikwã'jǊ-tsİ hanãwã-'na a-'ki
exist-DEC
KaikǊcӁ-CSO ArikwãjǊ-DEC sky-LOC
‘KaikǊcӁ and ArikwãjǊ live in heaven’Although this example reminds somewhat of (1264) and a different analysis is
suggested in (8.3.1.10.), it is not perfectly certain that [tsİ] represents the declarative morpheme in its often attested alternative pronunciation. On the other
hand, the consultant said that in coordinating constructions it should be pronounced as [tse] instead of [tsİ]. This suggests that it represents the very declarative morpheme -tse. This is furthermore a counter argument against the
possibility that the coordinating function of [tsİ] could be related to the element
-tsİ in first and second person plural pronouns (see 4.7.). In the present analysis, I consider [tsİ] in constructions like (1329) as the declarative -tse.
Another possibly related morpheme is -tsy-, which is provisionally identified as a gerundial morpheme. It will be dealt with briefly in section (5.2.2.2.)
below, and more thoroughly in section (8.1.).
5.2.1.7. Final remarks about -tse vs. -ki
In Hengeveld (2000) the difference between “indicative” and “declarative” is
defined on the basis of the distinction between modality and illocution. declarative is an illocutionary category which identifies the speech act as an assertion, while indicative is a modal category which refers to the attitude of
commitment of the speaker to the truth of the content of the speech act.
Hengeveld’s observation that “declarative markers may combine with modal
markers that would be in conflict with an indicative marker”, sheds a light on
the facts discussed in (5.2.1.1.). Because -ki is never combined with an adjacent
irrealis morpheme such as future -nã- or potential -tsy-, whereas -tse is, the
latter may be declarative and the former indicative. However, this analysis does
not provide for an explanation of the facts discussed in (5.2.1.2.).
No solid evidence was found for a single comprehensive function of the
distinction between -ki and -tse. If a unifying account of the difference between
the two declarative markers is at all possible, we are still in want of it.
7.1.1.).","[331, 332, 333, 334]"
"Tense, modality and aspectMood is expressed by clause-formative verb-final morphemes, which are discussed in (5.2.). When expressed at all, tense and aspect are expressed in verbal
morphology through different means. Reduplication and several suffixes serve
to indicate temporal, aspectual and further modal contrasts.
Kwaza has a basic future vs. non-future tense distinction. The distinction
between past and present is often unmarked. There are nevertheless ways to
express present and past. Adverbs such as txa'rwa ‘first, now, today’ and lato
‘yesterday’ refer to present and past events periphrastically. Furthermore, there
are morphological possibilities to express different degrees of past tense.
Kwaza has a number of morphemes which express aspectual distinctions
such as repetitive and habitual. However, the distinction between past tense and
degrees of aspectual perfectivity is vague.
Some temporal suffixes such as future -nã-, and aspectual suffixes like procrastination -tara- have also a modal value, in this case respectively: ‘to want’
and ‘fortunately’. Also the first person singular form of the volitive mood morpheme, -damͿ, can be used as a modal suffix ‘to want’ rather than as a strictly
grammatical mood and person marker. Again, the distinction between tense,
aspect and mood is vague.
In the present section the temporal, modal and aspectual categories which
can be distinguished in Kwaza are discussed. Because of their often amalgamated status, I have not divided this section into neat subsections “tense”,
“mood” and “aspect”. Instead, the morphemes are roughly grouped together in5.5. Tense, modality and aspect389the following way: sections (5.5.1.) to (5.5.5.) deal with morphemes which are
more tense-like than others, sections (5.5.6.) to (5.5.18.) contain morphemes
which are more modality-like, and sections (5.5.19.) to (5.5.33.) make a more
aspect-like impression. Nevertheless, I present the categories primarily from
the perspective of the forms themselves, and discuss their various functions as
they present themselves. Morpheme order variation and the combinability of
morphemes has only been mentioned sporadically, and requires more research.
Several examples were elicited as translations of suitable adaptations of
phrases from “the TMA questionnaire” in Dahl (1985:198-206). The corresponding entry numbers have been indicated, together with a short description
of their context, if necessary.
5.5.1. Zero marking of present and past
The basic grammaticalised tense distinction in Kwaza is between future and
non-future. Furthermore there are some less basic means to express remote
past. Predicates which are not marked for future or remote past can be interpreted as referring to a state of affairs in the present just as well as in the past.
Compare the following examples:
(1935)txa'hͿ ba-jãhͿ-'nã-tse
path
clear-CL:path-FUT-DEC
‘he wants/is going to clear the road’ (TMA:27)(1936)txa'hͿ ba-jã'hͿ-ki
path
clear-CL:path-DEC
‘he clears/cleared / is/was clearing the/a road / roads’ (TMA:5-11;24)The exact temporal interpretation of an unmarked verb depends on the discourse context or on temporal adverbs. Compare the following examples:
(1937)awy-'mǊ-ki
cold-CL:liquid-DEC
‘it (the water) is (usually) cold’ (visible) (TMA:30;31;34)(1938)la'to

hot-CL:liquid-DEC
yesterday cold-CL:liquid-DEC first
‘yesterday it (the water) was cold, today it is warm’ (TMA:32)5.5.2. past -kyThere is a morpheme which indicates past tense, but it is not very frequently
encountered. Compare the following examples:3905. The verb phrase(1939)nǊ'ri-xa-re
satiate-2-INT
‘are you full?’(1940)nǊ'ri-xa-hͿ-re
satiate-2-NOM-INT
‘were you full?’
(this morning up to three days ago)(1941)nǊ'ri-xa-ky-hͿ-re
satiate-2-PAST-NOM-INT
‘were you full?’ (this morning up to three days ago)When example (1940) was compared to example (1941) the consultant commented that their temporal value is identical, but that (1941) was “stronger”.
However, there are no indications that -ky- indicates a different degree of relative temporal remoteness.
The past tense morpheme -ky- only occurs in combination with an immediately subsequent nominaliser -hͿ. It is unclear whether it represents the same
element as -ky- in the conditional mood marker -kywy of adverbial clauses (see
8.2.1.). There is no reason to assume that it is related to the element -ky in the
negative imperative morpheme -he-ky (see 5.2.7.). Here are some more examples:
(1942)la'to
tsu'ty kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki

‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’235(1943)la'to
jo-'mǊ
'kui-da-(ky)-hͿ-ki
yesterday manioc-CL:liquid drink-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC
‘yesterday I drank manioc chicha’In this past tense construction, the person cross-reference morpheme may be
reduplicated. The reduplicated form consists in a repetition of the person crossreference marker without the allomorphic variation as discussed in (5.5.4.):
(1944)kukui'hͿ-da-da-ky-hͿ-ki

"6468. Subordination and coordinationordinated to the matrix clause. Under the analysis of wara as a cliticised particle, this concessive construction can be regarded as an analytical equivalent of
the more synthetic concessive construction with -lete, which was discussed in
(8.2.2.1.).
The following examples represent the most basic occurrence of the “but”concessive:
(3426)hy'ja-hͿ=wara

see-CD:area-NEG-GER-NOM=but place-REF-CL:eye-NEG-DEC
‘he does not see but does not use glasses. / he does not see, nevertheless he does not use glasses’In the above examples, the verbal base of the subordinate clause was nominalised by -hͿ and subordinated to the matrix clause through cliticisation of
wara. In the following example, -hͿ- is a lexicalised part of the verbal base
waihͿ- ‘to be beautiful’. Instead of a subsequent nominaliser, =wara is attached to the verbal base immediately:
(3431)kwa'za-dy-nãi
wai.'hͿ=wara are'ta-da-rai-he-ki
Kwaza-POS-NOM beautiful=but understand-1S-damn-NEG-DEC
‘Kwaza is beautiful but I don’t know a thing’8.2. Adverbial clauses647The expected form *waihͿhͿwara was rejected. This example suggests above
all that although the combination of wai- ‘to be good’ with the element -hͿ- has
a lexicalised meaning of ‘be beautiful’, the same element -hͿ- has preserved
certain grammatical functions. Here, it combines its lexicalised status with its
nominalising subordinating status.
Note that the predicate of the concessive clause may also be nominalised by
another morpheme such as the temporal nominaliser -wy:
(3432)si aky'nͿda'nͿ
ja-'he-da-wy=wara 'İ-tse
I friend still
eat-NEG-1S-time=but go-DEC
‘(my) friend went away while I had not yet eaten’The next examples show that in combination with wara, the nominaliser can
have the scope over an entire sentence in the declarative mood. Arguments embedded in the concessive clause may even intervene between its predicate and
the concessive particle:
(3433)oja-e'te-da-tsy-tse
go-COMIT-1S-POT-DECzezƭju-dy-'rjͿ

eto'hoi a'sa-tse
hͿ=wara huru'ja-lİ-ki
woman child
leave-DEC NOM=but like-RECI-DEC
‘he left wife and children, but nevertheless they loved each other very
much’These examples suggest of course that -hͿ is not a bound nominalising morpheme any more, but that it has obtained a semi-independent status. If the discourse context allows, the conjunctional “particle” can even be “inflected” for
person.
(3435)da-hͿ=wa'ra mãrİ̘'?a-dy-nãi
pİ̘rİ̘'jã-nãi 'e-da-ki
speak-NOM have-1S-DEC
1S-NOM=but spirit-POS-NOM
‘nevertheless I know the Western man’s language’Possibly, the verb root that originally preceded -dahͿwara is understood and
has been omitted. These phenomena of ellipsis and cliticisation were further
discussed in (7.5.). In the following example, hͿwara is used even more independently:6488. Subordination and coordination(3436)hͿ=wa'rahu-'ra
smoke-IMP
‘nevertheless, smoke!’
NOM=butIt was said in a situation in which the hearer had declined an offered smoke but
where the speaker insisted. Here it is possible to maintain that nothing is omitted, but that hͿwara is used as a context-dependent pragmatic particle. In another situation the speaker uttered hͿwara as a single phrase in the figurative
sense of ‘never mind’ or ‘it is no problem’. Here the speaker had offered the
visiting hearer his hammock but the hearer had objected that he had come in
from the rain and that his clothes were wet. The speaker again reacted to this by
hͿwara ‘never mind’. As an equivalent expression he could also have said
na'nãi?Ϳky'wy ‘it is O.K. like that’.
In quoted speech constructions the concessive conjunction can be realised
through the extended particle tsyhͿwara ‘think that, but’ (see 5.5.11.). There
are other conditions which relate to the element -tsy-. In (8.1.2.3.) it is explained how -hͿ cannot be preceded immediately by future -nã-, but that -tsyhas to intervene. This requirement also holds for hͿwara:
(3437)wãwͿi-'nã-tsy-hͿ=wara
sleep-FUT-GER-NOM=buttsile'ta

afternoon-CSOa'wͿi=xare-ri'tsa-hͿ=wara
jerexwa-'le
see=turn-DR:outside-NOM=but jaguar-only
‘(..., and) went to sleep, but early in the night she looked outside, but
there was a jaguar!’ (t)
Notice with respect to the latter example also that the difference between the
subject of the but-clause and the matrix clause does not require formal marking.
Notice with respect to the counterfactual concessive example (3348) in
(8.2.1.2.1.) that the but-clause can also refer to a possible non-realised fact.
8.2.3. Additive -dykytİ
The contrast between the following example, which is a repetition of (3394),
and (3439) shows that although the concessive may have a connotation of contemporaneousness, this notion can be expressed in a different and more direct
way by the additive suffix -dykytİ:
(3438)yro-le'te
'kui-ki
cry-CONC drink-DEC
‘he drank (while) crying’(3439)y'ro-dykytİ 'kui-ki
cry-ADDI
drink-DEC
‘he cried, but drank’
‘he drank crying’8.2. Adverbial clauses649In the next example, the additive phrase may be considered as a verb phrase
hoho?Ϳ-, which is embedded in the (nominalised) main clause headed by the
predicate hanǊ?Ϳ-:
(3440)ho'ho-Ϳ-dyky'tİ
ha'nǊ-Ϳ-'hͿ
black-ATT-ADDI grey-ATT-NOM
‘half black half grey’It cannot be excluded that the additive phrase is a nominal which is placed in a
dependent position modifying a head noun. The following example shows that
a phrase which ends in -dykytİ can be followed by -ki:
(3441)o'ho-dyky'tİ-ki
cough-ADDI-DEC
‘he’s coughing as well’3718.2.4. Absolutive and general manner -tja
The cosubordinative suffix -tja will be discussed in section (8.3.1.4.) as a special variant of the cosubordinative suffix -ta. Besides this function, -tja also occurs as an adverbialiser. This will be discussed here and briefly also in
(6.2.4.5.).
No apparent semantic differences were observed between cosubordinative
-tja and -ta. From a grammatical point of view, however, there are two important differences. Firstly, verbs ending with -tja never bear overt person crossreference marking and they can only have a third person interpretation. Secondly, the subject of the verb ending in -tja is not obligatorily equivalent with
the matrix clause subject. Therefore, it is possible that besides its function as a
cosubordinated clause, -tja may also mark an adverbial clause. Because no semantic or functional differences were encountered between clauses ending in
-tja and clauses ending in -ta, I have analysed -tja as a special cosubordinative
morpheme. Nevertheless, many clauses ending in -tja could be argued to possess the adverbial function of “manner” in a general way. Perhaps one should
better say that clauses ending in -tja often have a semantically neutral “absolutive” adverbial function. Absolutive clauses sketch the background in which
the event expressed by the matrix predicate is situated (see Payne 1997:320).
Compare the following examples:
(3442)onİ=bu'ru-tja
awã'te-ki
come=pass-CSO sad-DEC
‘she was sad as she arrived’371.This comment was made by ME who was coughing because of influenza herself as
she heard someone coughing too on a audio-tape.","[683, 684, 685, 686, 687]"
"6588. Subordination and coordination8.3.1.2. Second person marking in imperative cosubordination
Subjects of same subject medial clauses are identical to those of the matrix
clause. This does not imply that they are always marked in the same way. Remember that it was demonstrated in section (5.2.) how in other moods than the
declarative, different ways of person cross-reference marking may be employed. In the imperative and the negative imperative, for example, the second
person subject is cross-referenced by -Ø- (singular) and -Ø-xa- (plural), even
though in the declarative it is -xa- and -xa-xa- respectively. In the imperative
matrix clause of the following example the second person singular is zeromarked, as expected, but in the medial clause, it is expressed optionally by
-xa-:
(3484)İ-(xa)-'ta
hu-Ø-'ra
go-2-CSO smoke-2-IMP
‘go there and have a smoke!’There is no doubt that both clauses have a second person singular subject. The
difference between the situations, in which second person either gets overt or
zero-expression in the medial clause, probably concerns the interpretation of
the cosubordinative marker -ta. In the zero-expressed situation, the cosubordinative marker is probably interpreted as a copy of the imperative: ‘you go
there! and you have a smoke!’. In the overtly expressed situation, i.e. with person marking by -xa-, -ta could be regarded as representing declarative: ‘you
going there, you have a smoke!’. In the medial clause of the next negative imperative example the subject is expressed overtly:
(3485)hatsi'hͿ-xa-'ta ja
oja=bu'ru-he-'ky
naked-2-CSO already go=arrive-NEG-NEI
‘you can’t arrive (being still) naked!’The context in which this command was uttered was in the back of a truck
driving through the forest on a hot day and people did not wear their shirts.
However, when arriving in a settlement it is considered decent to be properly
dressed. The literal interpretation of this sentence is ‘(while) you are naked, do
not arrive already!’. Possibly then, the cosubordinative marker cannot really be
interpreted as a “copy” of the negative imperative matrix mood. Consequently,
person marking in the medial clause is as if it were an declarative clause. The
same may be said of the following imperative example:
(3486)xyi aky'ta e'mã-xa-xa-ta
o'ja-xa-ra Ba'hozo-nã
go-AS-IMP Barroso-LOC
you two more-2-AS-CSO
‘you three are going to Barroso!’8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses659Second person is marked zero in the matrix clause, whereas it is expressed by
-xa- in the medial clause. Here, as well as in (3485), the medial clause cannot
directly be interpreted as a command.
The examples discussed above point at least in the direction of two things.
In the first place, they suggest that the cosubordinative mood marker does not
always “copy” the mood value of the matrix clause. In the second place, although subjects of medial clauses may be identical to matrix clause subjects,
they are not necessarily marked identical.
8.3.1.3. Second person marking in interrogative cosubordination
The present subsection concerns variation between overt and zero-marking of
second person in clauses which are cosubordinated to an interrogative matrix
predicate. In (8.3.1.2.) above, variation between overt and zero-marking of second person in medial clauses was explained in relation to zero-marking of the
second person in the imperative matrix predicate. Such an explanation is not
possible in the case of interrogative matrix clauses. Here, the variation appears
to be optional. In the next example, second person is expressed overtly across
the entire clause chain, as expected:
(3487)Ǌcenãi-'nã-xa-ta ere'we-xy-xa-ki
know-FUT-2-CSO write-CL:leaf-2-DEC
‘you are writing in order to learn’However, it is absent in the next examples:
(3488)tsǊhǊ-'du-ta

‘why are you going for a walk?’(3489)tsǊhǊ-'du-ta

coha-si'ki
what-BER-CSO dress-CL:foot-2-AS-INT foot-CL:skin
‘why (for what purpose) are you (PL) putting on shoes?’One could explain away these examples by interpreting the medial clause as a
cleft construction ‘why is it that...?’, but this explanation runs into problems
when one considers examples involving other persons, like (3479) and (3480)
and the following:6608. Subordination and coordination(3491)tsǊhǊ-'du-da-ta
ha'do-da-re
why-BER-1S-CSO pierce-1S-INT
‘why did I pierce it?’Furthermore, second person marking appears to be optional in other constructions, even though co-referent first person marking in a similar position would
be obligatory:
(3492)ã'wͿi-(xa)-ta 'nãi-xa-re
like-2-DEC
see-2-CSO
‘did you watch first before you try?’(3493)ã'wͿi-da-ta 'nãi-da-ki
see-1S-CSO like-1S-DEC
‘I watched / learnt first before I do that’The only explanation of a more general validity for the absence or optionality
of second person marking in medial clauses would be that it could hardly lead
to ambiguity. Persons other than the second are usually clearly indicated, even
the third person, albeit fused in a special cosubordinative marker -tja, cf.
(3489):
(3494)tsǊhǊ-'du-tja kunͿ-'djo-re
coha-si'ki
what-BER-CSO dress-CL:foot-INT foot-CL:skin
‘why (for what purpose) is he putting on shoes?’8.3.1.4. Third person marking in medial clauses: -tja and -ta
In matrix clauses, a third person subject gets zero cross-reference. In cosubordinated constructions with identical third person, a separate third person marker
is not identifiable in the medial clause. However the medial clause “mood”
marker is often -tja instead of the expected -ta as with all other persons. So one
might consider -tja as the result of fusion of third person subject and cosubordinative “mood”, but it is unclear which elements have fused. The morpheme is
pronounced usually as [tja], but the pronunciation [ta] is also encountered.377
The following examples illustrate its use in different moods:
(3495)Ǌcenãi-'he-tja
kuraku'ra hu'hui-ki
chicken
kill-DEC
know-NEG-CSO
‘by mistake he killed (not a pig but) a chicken’377.Maybe this form is based on historical assimilation and metathesis of the indefinite
object marker -ja- and the initial consonant of the cosubordinative marker -ta.","[695, 696, 697, 698]"
"3265. The verb phrase5.2.9.1. -tsi- as a preventive bound modal morpheme
In example (1507) monitory -tsi occurs deeper inside the predicate, succeeded
as it is by further person and mood marking. In that position it has a preventive
connotation. This resembles those constructions involving causational use of
-ni (see 5.2.4.1.) and volitional use of -da-mͿ (see 5.2.5.1.). Only a few instances of preventive modal use of -tsi were attested:
(1518)e'nãi-tja-eteja-'tsi-xa-xa-ta
areta-'nã-xa-xa-ki
quarrel-TRA-1PO-MON-2-AS-CSO know-FUT-2-AS-DEC
‘for him not to quarrel with you, therefore you’re going to learn”
(lit. ‘in order for you to (say) “don’t let him quarrel with us!” you’re
going to learn (your lesson)’)Note in this example that the second person plural object is expressed by a first
person plural object morpheme. This construction, which is to be understood
from the literal translation, is identical to that in quoted speech and other operations discussed in (5.5.11-14.). It seems likely that the construction derives
from cliticisation or the resumptive particle strategy, which were discussed in
(7.5.2.3.) and (7.5.2.2.) respectively.
Of the following example it is not understood why the (third person) plural
object is expressed by a (first person) singular object morpheme:
(1519)e'nãi-tja-ta?Ϳ-'tsi-tja
areta-'nã-tse
quarrel-TRA-1SO-MON-CSO know-FUT-DEC
‘for him not to quarrel with them, they want to learn’Being a sentence from an entire elicited paradigm, its translation may be
somewhat independable. Probably, ‘them’ and ‘they’ should be ‘him’ and ‘he’
respectively. The fact that the object is literally a first person is obviously a
consequence of the quotative nature of the construction.
Some other ill-understood semi-lexicalised uses of preventive -tsi are discussed in section (7.1.2.) because they involve the emphatic negative element

"3005. The verb phrasetranslated as ‘think that, it seems that, maybe’. Maybe it consists of the morphemes -te-he-re ‘(-INTENS-NEG-INT)’:
(1351)awe-'nã-tehere
rain-FUT-APPR
‘I think it is going to rain’Finally, there is a focus suffix -rati- (see 7.2.8.) which is often combined with a
question word in an interrogative matrix sentence:
(1352)tsuhǊ-ra'ti-wã hã
'ta-a-re
what-FOC-AO water say-1P-INT
‘what does “hã” mean?’(1353)wai-ra'ti-re
good-FOC-INT
‘is it delicious?’The specific morphemes involved in the emphatic interrogative expressions
will be treated more extensively in the aforementioned sections.
5.2.2.2. Gerundial -tsy- in the interrogative
As we have seen in third person examples like (1331) the interrogative marker
is attached to the zero-marked verb root. Although there is no alternation in the
interrogative between forms comparable to declarative -ki and -tse, there is a
morpheme which resembles -tse. The element -tsy- may be inserted between
subject cross-reference marking (which is zero for the third person) and interrogative -re. No solid explanations have been found with regard to its presence
or absence. Alternatively, the element -tsy- often occurs in nominalised constructions that can be identified as gerundial and which end in -tsy-hͿ (see
8.1.2.). There is a morpheme that is homophonous with -tsy-, but which has
been identified as an potential tense/aspect marker. Although I see no compelling reason to relate it to declarative -tse and gerundial -tsy-, it does have a
somewhat similar distribution, which may lead to ambiguity in the interrogative. Compare the following examples to (1331):
(1354)di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re
who cut-GER-INT
‘who cut (the tree)?’di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re
who cut-POT-INT
‘who is going to cut (the tree)?’The example in which -tsy- is analysed as gerundial has a past tense reading
when contrasted to present tense (1331) and to the potential construction that
has a future tense interpretation. It is unclear whether -tsy- is an allomorph of
declarative -tse in the third person interrogative or whether it is a different
morpheme. Probably the function of gerundial -tsy- is to give an extra cleft-like
effect, like ‘who could it be who ...?’ or ‘what could it be that ...?’. Note that in
case of verb stem ellipsis, -tsy- always precedes -re. In fact, tsyre is often used5.2. Mood301as a free minimal response particle, with a potential connotation of doubt: ‘is
it?’, ‘would it be?’, ‘I don’t know’. The element -tsy- is dealt with extensively
in section (8.1.). Gerundial -tsy- in combination with the interrogative is discussed further in (8.1.2.1.).
5.2.3. Imperative
The imperative mood marker -ra is used to indicate the speech act of commanding by which the hearer can be required, requested or invited to do something. The imperative marker attracts stress.
(1355)wady-'ra
give-IMP
‘give (it to him)!’(1357)e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-'ra
woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
‘give (it) to all women!’(1358)Q:İ-'nã-da-ki

‘I’m going’(1356)A:wa'dy-e'teja-'ra
give-1PO-IMP
‘give (it) to us!’İ-'ra
go-IMP
‘go!’182Two possible subjects have been attested for imperative verbs: second person
singular, which is zero-marked, and second person plural, which is marked by
-xa-. Zero-marking is explicitly indicated only in the first two of the examples
below:
(1359)ka'we
kui-Ø-'ra
coffee drink-2-IMP
‘drink coffee!’ (2sg)(1360)ka'we
'kui-Ø-xa-'ra
coffee drink-2-AS-IMP
‘drink coffee!’ (2pl)(1361)xyi'tsİ tͅi'tja
o'ja-xa-'ra
leave-AS-IMP

‘you are going without them!’ (2pl)(1362)xyi'tsİ o'ja-e'te-xa-'ra
(*o'ja?e'texaxa'ra)
you.PL leave-COMIT-AS-IMP
‘you are going with them!’ (2pl)These examples show that in contrast to the declarative, where unmarked person represents third person, the default value of the imperative is second per
182.According to MA this answer is a bit harsh. Nicer is: tsy're ‘would it be?’3025. The verb phraseson. The second person plural imperative is marked by -xa-, and this form contrasts with second person plural form -xa-xa- of the declarative and other
moods. The following examples represent strong evidence for this:
(1363)(1364)xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-ra
you
hit-AS-IMP
‘you hit!’vs.xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-xa-ki
you
hit-2-AS-DEC
‘you hit’xyi aky-'ta
e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra
more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP
you two-ANI
‘you three, go to Barroso!’Ba'hozo-na
Barroso-LOCAs explained in (5.1.), the element -xa-xa- consists of the second person element -xa- and a homophonous associated person marker -xa-. Considering the
fact that second person is zero-marked for the singular subject of the imperative, it is likely that it is also zero-marked for a plural subject. Therefore, the
element -xa- in the second person plural imperative represents associated person, and not second person.
In spite of the fact that -xa- in most imperative sentences represents a plural
subject, there are examples of the imperative in which -xa- is used for second
person singular. In the next example, which is from a mythical tale, the enchanted tapir is being addressed by a group of women:
(1365)huruja=du'hͿ-İteja-xa-ra
like=all-1PO-2-IMP
‘make love to us all!’ (t)Compare this example to (1356). The tapir from this tale is a singular being
with a solitary life. And far as I am aware no special register was used in this
tale. Therefore, I have interpreted -xa- as a second person subject marker.
Imperative verbs were never attested bearing any other subject person
marking than either zero or -xa-. Imperative verbs can be marked for any kind
of object and the same forms are used as in the declarative, with one exception.
The declarative first person object -ta- corresponds to the imperative (and
monitory) first person singular object -ta?Ϳ-:
(1366)wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra (*wadytara)

‘give it to me!’(1367)(1368)oi'tsi-ta?Ϳ-'ra

([jawÓihÓ'tãsa'4a])
see-NOM-1SO-AS-IMP
‘help!’ (lit. ‘you pl. look at me!’)303The negative imperative is expressed by a different morpheme -ky, which
will be treated in (5.2.7.). Nevertheless, some instances of a negative morpheme in combination with imperative -ra were attested. They are rather emphatic:
(1371)ehͿ-'he-ca-ra
make-NEG-EMP-IMP
‘don’t do that!’(1372)ja-'he-ca-xa-ra
eat-NEG-EMP-2-IMP
‘(since you didn’t work)
you (PL) are nót going to eat!’Note that -ra is not immediately attached to negative -he- in this construction.
The intervening element -ca- will be discussed below in section (5.2.3.3.).
5.2.3.1. -tsy- as an imperative element
No mitigated version of the imperative has been identified with absolute certainty. Sometimes the imperative can be expressed by an alternative construction which involves the potential/future morpheme -tsy-:
(1373)hako're
oja'nͿ-e-ra
/ hako're
tomorrow return-again-IMP/ tomorrow
‘tomorrow you (sg/pl) come again’ojanͿ-'?e-xa-tsy-tse
return-again-2-POT-DECThe next examples show that the alternative imperative construction with potential -tsy- may also be zero marked for second person just like the canonical
imperative construction is (note that both are embedded as reported speech
constructions, see 5.5.11.).
(1374)hã
mǊi-'ra-tsy-le-'hͿ
bõ'rõ-tse

bõ'rõ-tse
water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’3045. The verb phraseThe difference between overt and zero marked second person in the imperative
construction with potential -tsy- is discussed in section (8.1.1.1.).
The consultant regarded the imperative content of the alternative expressions as equally strong or equally nice. On one occasion, however, the potential
construction was indicated as a mitigated and possibly euphemistic alternative
to the imperative:
(1376)wayrjͿ-'ra
clean-IMP
‘clean!’/way'rjͿ-xa-tsy-tsİ
clean-2-POT-DEC
‘you may clean’5.2.3.2. -ta as an imperative element
The procrastinative morpheme -tara- ‘later’, ‘do first’ was discussed above and
demonstrated in example (1268). In the declarative it cannot precede -ki but
only -tsİ. In the imperative it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta.
This element -ta is not a cosubordinative marker, as it is clearly imperative in
combination with -tara-.
(1377)e'hͿ-tara-'ta
make-PROC-IMP
‘do that first! (before going away)’(1378)ka'we 'kui-tara-'ta
(1379)
coffeedrink-PROC-IMP
‘drink coffee first!, wait for the coffee!’here?ece-'hͿ-tara-'ta
rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
‘rest first!’Maybe -ta should be regarded as an allomorph of -ra, although it only occurs in
this construction. The morpheme -tara- is involved in several different constructions and will be treated by itself in section (5.5.19.).
5.2.3.3. The problem of imperative -ca
Imperative -ra may be preceded by the element -ca-, which is usually pronounced as [ta] but sometimes also as [tja]. Out of considerations which will be
explained towards the end of this section, I have provisionally identified -ca- as
an emphatic morpheme.
There are several verb stems which allow the application of -ca- in the imperative without any obvious semantic or pragmatic consequences. The only
consequence -ca- seems to have in the next example is the shift of stress:5.2. Mood(1380)koreja'ro waja-'ra
pan
bring-IMP
‘take the pan!’(1381)'cutse(')rjͿ-(ca)-'ra
lie-EMP-IMP
‘stay lying down!’/
/305koreja'ro wa'ja-ca-ra
pan
bring-EMP-IMPWith some verbs the element -ca- seems to have an effect on the meaning of
the utterance. In the next examples it is hard to determine what is the exact nature of this effect, because the demonstrative ayhͿ ‘that one (close to hearer)’
may co-determine the effect:
(1382)ay'hͿ dai-'ra
that grab-IMP
‘take thát one (which
we know, close or not)’(1383)ay'hͿ 'dai-ca-ra
that grab-EMP-IMP
‘take this one there! (i.e. the
one over there close to you)’Notice that besides the stress shift, the demonstrative in the latter example received extra heavy and probably emphatic or contrastive stress. This may confirm the suspicion that -ca- has an emphatic function. The next two examples
were considered as fully equivalent by MA, but to ZE there was a difference in
emphasis:
(1384)koreja'ro wa'ja-nͿ-'ra
pan
bring-REF-IMP
‘bring here the pan!’(1385)koreja'ro waja-'nͿ-ca-'ra
pan
bring-REF-EMP-IMP
‘I’m telling you, bring here the
pan (I’ve asked you before)!’The distinction between less emphatic and more emphatic literal equivalents of
the last example also involves -ca-, besides the combination of the nominaliser
plus the resignation morpheme -hͿ-tsy which may have emphatic and/or past
connotations (see 5.5.17.). Example (1387) is clearly an emphatic cleft construction:
(1386)koreja'ro
waja-nͿ-'ra-da-hͿ-tsy
pan
bring-REF-IMP-1S-NOM-RES
‘I said to you bring the pan!’(1387)koreja'ro
waja-'nͿ-ca-ra
jã-hͿ-'tsy
pan
bring-REF-EMP-IMP be-NOM-RES
‘I’m telling you bring here the pan (I’ve asked you before)!’3065. The verb phraseWith certain verbs the use of -ca- was considered correct by some people, but
incorrect by others. The next example was rejected by ZE, but accepted by
MA:
(1388)txu'hǊi mãmã'ñe-(*)ca-ra
small
sing-EMP-IMP
‘sing a little!’On one occasion the presence of -ca- was considered as correct, and on the next
occasion it was considered as incorrect by the very same person (MA):
(1389)'diri-(*)ca-'ra
descend-EMP-IMP
‘get out of the hammock!’Sometimes, the application of -ca- was allowed in one construction, but not in
another one:
(1390)'nãi-ca-ra
like-EMP-IMP
‘do like that!’(1391)magariDa-dy'nͿ nãi-(*ca)-'ra
Margarida-COMIT like-EMP-IMP
‘do it with Margarida!’Not all imperative verbs seem to allow the application of -ca-:
(1392)hy'hyrwa'ra
hu'huira
ka'we kui'ra
‘mİ̘'ra
tomã'ra‘walk!’
(*hy'hyrwaca'ra)
‘beat him!’
(*hu'huicara)
‘drink coffee!’ (*ka'we kuica'ra)
‘hit him!’
(*'mİ̘cara)
‘take a bath!’ (*tomaca'ra)In some rare instances there is a lexical semantic difference between imperative
with and without -ca-:
(1393)'aru'ra
a'ruca'ra‘cross!’
‘jump!’(1394)kurira
ku'rica'ra‘quiet! (don’t move)’
‘quiet! (don’t speak)’(1395)koreja'ro warja'ra
‘take the pan with you!’
koreja'ro wa'rjacara ‘hold the pan! (for me)’There are some possible explanations for the consultants’ different opinions
about the applicability and meaning of -ca-. It is quite possible that the dialect
of MA, who is from the mixed family I, has changed because of intensive con5.2. Mood307tact with the surrounding languages in the indigenous reserve. A related possibility is that there is more uncertainty among family I about the use of -ca-, and
that this is due to phenomena of linguistic attrition or obsolescence. Family II
forms a more closed and less plurilingual community in which Kwaza is the
only language used on a daily basis among all members. Another, important
complementary explanation is that the use of -ca- depends less on semantic
factors than on pragmatic factors, and that my methodology of direct elicitation
and translation of short phrases outside of a discourse context is wrong because
it does not make visible the function of -ca-. For the time being I am inclined to
attach most value to ZE’s remarks about -ca- and consider it as an emphatic
marker used in the imperative.
Note that the element -ca- is never used in combination with any other
mood morpheme than -ra and the cosubordinative. In the next example -caoccurs in a phrase cosubordinated to an imperative matrix phrase:
(1396)nãi-ca-ta
oce-'ra
like-EMP-CSO throw-IMP
‘throw it away like that!’Finally, note that -ca- succeeds the element -he- in an emphatic negative
construction in examples (1371) and (1372). This is also the only construction
in which -ca- is preceded by person marking.
5.2.3.4. Imperative particles
The combination of the elements -ca- and -ra is also used independently in elliptic constructions (see also 7.5.2.):
(1397)R:ja-'e-da-mͿ
eat-again-1S-VOL
‘I’m going to eat again’A:ca-'raEMP-IMP‘do that!’, ‘yes!’The answer to the remark can be said to derive from the expression ja'?eca'ra
‘eat again!’ of which the stem is omitted. It is likely that this ellipsis led to the
emergence of an auxiliary-like verbal particle cara ‘order, send’:
(1398)zjwãu ca-'ra 'ta-ta-ki
João EMP-IMP say-1O-DEC
‘João sent me’ (lit. ‘João said “go!” to me’)(1399)zjwãu-'wã ca-'ra 'ta-da-ki
EMP-IMP say-1S-DEC
João-AO
‘I sent João’3085. The verb phraseIn a similar fashion the verb-like particle ratja ‘order him’, ‘insist’ must
have emerged. In this case the imperative morpheme -ra functions as the root,
in a fixed combination with -tja-, which probably originates from a transitiviser. ratja- shows more resemblance to a normal transitive verb stem than does
cara:

The verb-final exhortative morpheme -ni is pronounced as [ni] or [nƭ]. It can be
applied to verbs cross-referring to the first person inclusive subject by -a-, indefinite subject by -wa and zero-marked third person subject.

[nƭ] rather than [ni]. It occurs often, but not necessarily, in subordinate constructions and it has a valency-increasing effect:

the embedded agentive subject of the verb root. In (1419) subject of onİ- ‘to
come’ is not expressed by cross-reference marking. However, the subject of
onİnƭ- ‘to make him come’ is. Compare the following examples:

Ǌi-'nƭ-da-ta

hack-REF-1S-DEC
‘I cut myself (on purpose)’(1429)hadai-'nƭ-da-ki
hack-CAUS-1S-DEC
‘I cut myself (by accident)’Because this construction involving -nƭ- is the result of post-cliticising complementation similar to the reported speech construction, it will also be discussed in (5.5.15.). The causational construction resembles the volitional construction with -damͿ- ‘to want’ discussed in (5.2.5.1.). An important difference
is that the causational morpheme is never preceded by subject crossreference.183
5.2.4.2. Exhortative paucal -jaAn alternative exhortative construction involving the element -ja(-) is suspected to have a paucal connotation.

183.But see the remark about this construction in note (12) in (7.5.2.3.).","[337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"
"Adverbial clausesAs was pointed out in chapter (6.) adverbs resemble nouns in a number of
ways. In various sections of chapter (4.) the possibilities for internal complexity of noun phrases were illustrated. Section (8.4.1.) of the present chapter is
devoted to internally complex nominals that can be compared to relative
clauses in other languages. Likewise, adverbs can be internally highly complex
too. The present section on adverbial clauses deals with such complex adverbs.
From a lexical-categorial point of view there seem to be basically two types of
adverbial clauses: nominals and verbals. Nominal adverbial clauses are terminated by nominalising morphemes such as temporal -wy and general -nãi. Although these morphemes can be preceded by person markers, they can also be
followed by case markers. Verbal adverbial clauses end in subordinate moodlike morphemes such as conditional -kywy and concessive -lete. These clauses
do not exhibit as many nominal characteristics as the nominal adverbial clauses
do. For example, they were never attested with case marking. Nevertheless,
they have some formal characteristics which do remind of nominal morphology, such as the constituing elements -wy and -te. The present section consists
of the following major subsections: (8.2.1.) conditional clauses; (8.2.2.) concessive clauses; (8.2.3.) additive clauses; (8.2.4.) manner clauses; (8.2.5.) temporal clauses; (8.2.6.) general adverbial clauses; (8.2.7.) contemporative
clauses. In table (32) below all basic types of adverbial clause constructions
and the involved morphemes are listed:6288. Subordination and coordinationTable 32. Overview of adverbial clause morphology

-8.2.1. Conditional
There are several conditional constructions in Kwaza. They consist of an adverbial conditional clause and a matrix clause. They can involve two different
conditional antecedent phrases (protasis, Trask:1993), the difference between
which is not perfectly clear. One ends in the conditional marker -kywy and another one ends in the preconditional marker -lİ. Conditional clauses are the antecedents to a usually sentence-final consequent matrix clause (apodosis,
Trask:1993). The matrix clause may be in the declarative mood, and it contains
the potential marker -tsy-. If the antecedent containing -kywy is subsequently
ended by a cosubordinative mood marker -ta, the matrix clause will bear an irrealis condition morpheme -rydy-, which has a genuine irrealis function. These
irrealis morphemes occur after person cross-reference and precede mood
marking of the matrix clause. Another attested possible matrix clause mood for
a conditional antecedent is the negative imperative.
8.2.1.1. Open conditional with -kywy
The conditional mood marker -kywy terminates the antecedent of an declarative
consequent. The declarative consequent may represent an informative, explanatory or advisory statement, and it will nearly always contain the futurelike potential morpheme -tsy-:

know-NEG-1S-COND I-POS-NOM chief quarrel-TRA-1O-POT-DEC
‘if I don’t learn, my chief will quarrel with me’Notice that zero-marked subjects of the consequent and the antecedent represent a third person subject in the above examples. A consequent which expresses an advice can also be interpreted as an order. In that case, its zeromarked subject is the second person singular:
(3334)'mã-hata-kywy
o'ja-tsy-tse

‘when she calls you, go there’(3335)kui-'dy-hata-kywy
'kui-tsy-tse
drink-CAU-3S.2O-COND drink-POT-DEC
‘when she offers drink, drink it!’However, a consequent in the imperative mood was never attested, but consequents in the negative imperative mood are often attested. They function as a
warning, and they never contain a potential morpheme:
(3336)'mã-hata-kywy
oja-he-'ky
call-3S.2O-COND go-NEG-NEI
‘when she calls you, don’t go there’(3337)kui-'dy-hata-kywy
'kui-he-ky
drink-CAU-3S.2O-COND drink-NEG-NEI
‘when she offers drink, don’t drink it!’Notice that the alternative negative imperative construction involving ihƭ‘on the contrary’ seems to require a different order of consequent and antecedent:
(3338)'ja-damͿ=ihƭ-'ky
o'kja-da-kywy
eat-want=contrary-NEI hunt-1S-COND
‘don’t think of eating from what I’m going to hunt!’6308. Subordination and coordinationA consequent in the volitive mood also appears to precede the antecedent, and
it is an exception to the obligatory presence of the potential morpheme -tsytoo:
(3339)'kui-e-da-mͿ
na'nãi-kywy
drink-again-1S-VOL very-COND
‘in that case I’ll (stay a bit longer and) have (coffee) again’It is probable that both of the last mentioned constructions above are rather
idiomatic expressions.
Note that the morpheme -kywy is not really further analysable. However, its
second syllable strongly resembles the deverbal adverbial and nominalising
suffix -wy ‘time, the moment that, when’, both from a formal and a semantic
point of view:
(3340)tyje-'wy
rain.stop-time
‘after the rain’
(as an adverb)(3341)ty'je-kywy
rain.stop-COND
‘when the rain has stopped’
(Q: ‘how will you go, with this rain?’)(3342)tsa'si-kywy
ca'ri-da-heta-da-ki
follow-COND shoot-1S-DESI-1S-DEC
‘if he follows (you hither) I want to kill him’ /
‘the moment he comes after (you) I want to kill him’ (t)Maybe the conditional was originally based on a temporal metaphor, as it still
seems to be somewhat ambiguous in this respect. However, it is not fully exchangeable for a temporal construction because the meaning of the element -kyis hardly definable. It has no obvious semantic affinity with the negative imperative -heky (see 5.2.7.), nor with the contrastive past morpheme -ky-hͿ- (see
5.5.2.).
Observe that the consequent in example (3342) does not contain the (potential) morpheme -tsy- even though it depends on an “open” condition. Apparently, desiderative -heta- has the right properties to take its place. In contrast,
negative imperative and volitive (and therefore “controlled”!) consequents do
not bear any substitute for -tsy- at all. Moreover, the counterfactual consequent
contains the irrealis morpheme -rydy-, which will be discussed in the next subsection. Accordingly, the morpheme -tsy- should probably be regarded as an
irrealis morpheme in the “open” condition.
8.2.1.2. Counterfactual conditional with -kywy and -rydyIn (8.2.1.1.) I have discussed “open” conditions, in which the fulfilment of the
condition is a realistic possibility. There is a “counterfactual” conditional con8.2. Adverbial clauses631struction in which the antecedent is “embedded” in a cosubordinative mood
form and bears the nominaliser -hͿ-, while the declarative consequent bears the
irrealis condition morpheme -rydy-.

antecedent is a concessive “but” clause containing the subordinator -wara as
discussed in (8.2.2.3.), counterfactuality is emphasised:

"Repetitive -(je)?e-There is a frequently used repetitive morpheme -e-, which means ‘to do again’.
Often it receives stress. Note the following examples:
(2381)kui-'e-a-hͿ-ki
drink-again-1P-NOM-DEC
‘we drank again’(2382)txa 'a-e-ki

‘hot season’ (lit. ‘when it

(2385)kui-'e-da-mͿ
drink-again-1S-VOL
‘I’ll drink more’There is a morphophonological variant of -e-: -je?e-. It is obligatory when
preceded by a negative morpheme:

‘I’m not going there again’kui-'he-je?e-'nã-da-ki

the next example:
(2394)tomã-e-'nã-da-ki
(*'tomanã'?edaki)
bathe-again-FUT-1S-DEC
‘I’m going to take a bath again’Under ellipsis of the verb root in the proper context (see 7.5.2.), the repetitive functions as an independent verbal root:
(2395)je'e-da-ki
again-1S-DEC
‘I (spoke, did, went, etc.) again’Note that the allomorph -je?e- has to be used in this construction. This could
suggest that, in the other examples, the allomorph is in reality a compound verb
root to which -e- is attached. However, the verb root je- means ‘to dig’, and it
is unlikely that this is semantically related to -je?e- ‘again’. It seems also unlikely that there is a relation with the directional -je- ‘away’ (see 5.3.1.).
The repetitive morpheme -e can be attached word-finally to a noun. The result is a noun with the meaning ‘too, also’. This is discussed in (4.4.6.).

In this example, which is from the same text as (3744), the grandmother is trying to convince her daughter of not killing her own son. She tries to work on
the daughter’s consciousness by emphasising the fact that the boy is her son
and that he has searched for her in spite of the danger.
I see any negative interpretation of variants of the indignant construction as
a side-effect of the interrogative clause to which jã- is attached. In these examples, which all involve indignation or categorical negation, the only obligatory
element is the root jã-.","[750, 751]"
"4605. The verb phraseerties. Furthermore, it is not negative, but it may have retained one property of
the negative in that it involves the rejection of a presupposition. The fact that

Maybe the lamentative morpheme is etymologically related to the verb ãwãte‘to be sad’.
7.2.7. Expletive -rai- ‘damned!’
The morpheme -rai ‘damned!’ has basically an exclamative function. Although
it can be used in a neutral way, it has usually a heavily expletive connotation.
However, this often occurs in an ironic context of faking indignation. The mor5487. Other morphosyntactic structurespheme is mostly applied to verb stems, between the person cross-reference and
mood markers:

Also the negative morpheme -he- may be involved, but without a negative

may have a negative sense:

hurt-CAU-1S-damn-INT=be-SWR like-2-INT
‘it doesn’t hurt, no!’ (speaker does not want to admit he has pain)The expletive morpheme sometimes replaces the mood marker, as in the second alternative answer to (2920), and it does not have to be very impolite. The
following examples represent possible answers to a compliment by someone
about the tasteful soup the speaker has made:
(2927)'wai-he-'ki
good-NEG-DEC
‘it does not taste good’(2928)'wai-he-'rai
good-NEG-damn
‘it does not taste good’In fact, (2928) was considered as more polite than the countersuppositional example (2927).
The following examples represent a fixed type of emphatic expression, in
which -rai replaces a mood marker, and in which the root wai- occurs in the
cosubordinative mood:
(2929)awy-'rjͿ-rai
cold-CD:area-damn

good-CSO(2930)kara'ri-da-rai wai-'ta
thirst-1S-damn good-CSO
‘I’m so thirsty!’(*waiki)It is not known whether one of the constituents is subordinated to the other.
In the example (2865), -rai is attached to a noun. In the next example, the
derived noun is zero-verbalised:
(2931)'ñǊ-rai-re
faeces-damn-INT
‘it isn’t dung, pal!’ (hearer was afraid to taste liquorice)5507. Other morphosyntactic structuresSection (7.2.1.) contains several examples in which -rai is combined with
the paucal morpheme -ry- in the following manner:
(2932)kuraku'ra-ry-'rai
chicken-PAU-damn
‘those/my/your/his chicken’In this combination, -rai does not seem to have a strong expletive connotation.
However, it does seem that there can be a context dependent possessive connotation. That possessive relation can be made explicit, as in the next example:
(2933)'xyi-dy-hͿ
tala-ry-'rai
you-POS-NOM uncle-PAU-damn
‘your uncles’The morpheme -rai may be etymologically related to the verb root rai'hͿ‘to ruin’, and/or to the root of nouns such as 'rai?ͿhͿ ‘animal, thing’, 'rai?ͿnǊ
‘poison’.
7.2.8. Focus -ratiWhen applied to nouns or verb roots, the morpheme -rati- has a focus function.
It occurs often in interrogative clauses, attached to the question word tsǊhǊ
‘what’.

explicitly or implicitly, at hand. Of the following set of alternatives, to be possibly uttered when one sees tracks in the sand, the consultant said that the one
without -rati- was ‘less clear’:

value. In the following examples, -rati- replaces the mood marker and indicates
surprise and emphasis:

7.2.9. Historical narrative use of -ratiIn historical narrative the morpheme -rati- is usually applied to the matrix
predicate in a position between person cross-reference and mood marking (note
that this is also the case in example (2944) above). It signals the fact that
something used to occur in olden times. Often, this concerns traditional customs which do not exist any more. In the following examples, -rati- is applied
because, according to the consultant, the custom or the people concerned ‘don’t
exist any more now’:
