"392.4.1.3 Negation
Sometimes, negation is considered as a mood type in contrast with
imperative and interrogative sentence type. But here the negation is taken
as a verbal inflection which modifies the verb and the verb phrase. This
leads us to distinguish between two types and strategies of sentence
negation as found in African languages. The first type is an internal
negation of the verb word which is common in African languages. This
usually involves affixes either before or after the verb word. An example
of this strategy is found in Aghem, a Benue-Congo (Niger-Congo)
language (Anderson, 1979), and in Labala, a Bantu (Niger-Congo)
language (David Morgan, p.c.). The second type is an external negation
of the verb word. That is, negative particles occur in clause-final position
and it negates the whole clause or sentence. In the case of transitive
verbs, the negative particle occurs after the object. This type is found in
Chadic languages in Nigeria and Cameroon (Creissels, 2008).
Tima has two obligatory negative particles that appear in a negative
sentence: The negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic
marker '-Vŋ'. In this respect, Tima resembles Hausa, a Chadic language
(Kraft and Kraft, 1973) and Gur (Niger- Congo) languages (Watters,
2000) in using double negative particles which are external to the verb
word. Consequently, Tima in most cases displays the following negative
pattern: (S) NEG-SM-V root-(O)-NEG (see 4.6).","[60, 61]"
"4.6.1 Negative declarativeThe negation of declarative clauses involves a denial of intransitive,
transitive and ditransitive clauses or predications. All of these declarative
types are negated by two negative particles in the clause: the negative
particle 'kV-', which is procliticised to a verb; it occurs in slot 1 in Table
4.1, and the negative particle '-Vŋ' which is encliticised to a verb or verb
phrase; it occurs in slot 12 in Table 4.1 in case of intransitive verbs, and
the final position of a clause in case of transitive clauses. Therefore, the
former is considered as a particle which negates the whole clause. The
proclitic negative marker 'kV-' always fuses with the pronominal markers
in slot 3 in Table 4.1. The following examples illustrate negation with a
negative verb contrasting positive verb forms with negative ones.

particles in a clause, otherwise the resultant clause will be ungrammatical.

"4.6.2 Negative imperative, subjunctive and veridical moodIn most cases, the imperative, subjunctive and veridical clauses in Tima
are negated in the same way as the negation of declarative clauses, i.e. by
the particle 'kV' and 'Vŋ'. The examples in 178 and 179 show how the257imperative negation is being applied to the 2sg, 2pl and the subjunctive
weak form in the case of 1pl inclusive. The negative particles are
underlined in the examples below. Concerning the negative particle 'kV',
here they are variable with regard to the person and number and they are
changed according to the vowel harmony of the verb root (Bashir
forthcoming).

The vowel of the negative proclitic 'kV(V)-' is lengthened. It is a result of
the combination of the proclitic vowel and the person marker in the case
of 2nd sg and 1pl incl, which is usually represented by the vowel 'a-' and
'i-', respectively (see 4.4.3.1).","[278, 279]"
"4.6 Verbal negation
Tima has different types of negation marking. That is, the negative
strategy in Tima involves negation of the whole clause, in which case it is
described as clausal negation. Or, alternatively, it negates some of the
clause constituents, such as nouns, adverbs, adjectives and quantifiers.
This type is described as constituent negation (Alamin forthcoming).
Negation in Tima is expressed by using different strategies; see section
2.4.1.3. On the one hand, it uses two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ' in a
single clause, especially in negating the declarative and imperative
clauses. It is the most common strategy of negation marking in Tima. On
theotherhand,Timausesaninherentlynegativequantifier'amaŋaŋ'/'amaŋ', 'nothing/lack/not-exist' to indicate that the event or
situation described by the verb does not occur or exist.",[275]

follows:
NEG + IMP/SUBJ (O) + NEG
With regard to the negation of veridical clauses, it has been mentioned in
Section (4.4.3.4) that the verdical marker in Tima is 'kV-', therefore
haplology (see section 2.2.1.3) as a phonological process takes place
when negating these clauses. That is, the proclitic negative marker 'kV-' is
dropped because of its similarity with the veridical marker 'kV-', while
the enclitic negative marker '-Vŋ' occurs. The examples are in (180)
below.

Tima uses the two negative strategies mentioned above. In the case of
perfective situation the common negative strategy ('kV-' and '-Vŋ'
particles) is used as in (180). Alternatively, in the case of imperfective
situations the quantifier 'amaŋ' is used as in (181). This form consists of
the stative marker 'a-' plus 'maŋ' which means 'it is nothing'. But actually
the form 'maŋ' has no meaning by itself; see the examples below.","[279, 280, 281]"

NEG + VP (includes V + NP (O)) + NEG
It is noticed that the negative particles usually harmonize with the verb
root. In example (174, 175 and 176) above the proclitic negative marker
'kV-' harmonizes with the verb root with regard to the feature of ± ATR
and to the other qualities of the vowel (in terms of frontness, height, or
backness), (Bashir forthcoming).
All tenses (future vs. non-future) of verbs are negated simply by adding
the two negative particles 'kV-' and '-Vŋ'. See the examples above.","[277, 278]"
"254In Section 4.6.1 the negative constructions of declarative sentence type
will be presented. The negative construction of the imperative,
subjunctive and veridical mood will be shown in 4.6.2. The negation of
perfective and imperfective verb forms will be described and discussed in
Section 4.6.3.","[275, 276]"
"The examples of negative perfective aspect in (181) below indicate that
the situation or the event which is negated is finished completely.

indicate that the situation or action which is negated has not finished yet.",[281]
"4.4.3.1 The imperative mood
The imperative mood is used to give a direct command to addressee(s)
(Fromkin, 2005). In Tima, the positive imperative form of verbs is
205considered as a stem rather than a verb root. That is, the imperative often
takes different suffixes which provide an additional meaning to the root.
These suffixes are considered as derivational suffixes and the meaning of
verbs can not be completed without the appearance of those suffixes (see
section (4.5).
In Tima, the positive imperative mood is unmarked for person in the case
of 2nd person singular; i.e. it does not take any personal prefix as the
subjunctive mood type does. In the case of 2nd person plural it is marked
by the prefix 'na-' which is very productive in the language. It is found
that in the case of the negative imperative mood for the 2nd person
singular that the form is marked by the prefix 'a-' which occurs after the
negative proclitic 'kV-'. In this case the imperative form is classified as a
hortative form/mood (weak imperative/command, see 4.6 on verbal
negation).
The positive imperative form is considered as a simple form in Tima. It is
always used while discussing other word formation processes or in
explaining certain word-structure through out this study. The examples
are:
(115)
2nd sg
a) dɨŋʌʌŋ2nd Pl

'bring'b) daana-daa'run'c) hʊdɔnɔna-hadɔnɔ'sit down'd) hɘlakna-hɘlak'remain seated'e) paŋana-paŋa'open (mouth)'206With regard to the imperative formation of the 2nd person plural, it is
noticed that when the form starts with a consonant as in (115), the
personal prefix is just attached to the verb without any change in the
stem. On the other hand, when the imperative form starts with a vowel as
in (116), the glide '-y-' is inserted between the prefix and the stem (an
epenthetic glide). This occurs in order to avoid the combination of two
vowels.

'eat'b) ʌt̪inʌ-y-ʌt̪i'sleep'c) amaakna-y-amaak'wash yourself/yourselves'd) alɘmna-y-alɘm'bite'The structure of the positive imperative forms can be represented by the
following formula:
a) 2nd Sg: ø-stem
b) 2nd Pl:na-stemIn addition, there are a number of suppletive imperative forms in Tima.
The imperative form of the 2nd person plural is completely different from
the imperative form of the 1st person singular. Therefore, the 2nd plural
imperative forms are not predictable (see also 4.5.1.2). The examples are:207(117)

Subjunctive mood refers to verb forms or sentence type which indicate
the attitude of the speaker including tentativeness, vagueness, request or
uncertainty. It is considered as an indirect command. It always asks for
permission (Lyons, 1995).","[226, 227, 228, 229]"

the negation of perfective and imperfective differs with regard to the verb
forms. Both perfective and imperfective aspects are negated by the
negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic '-Vŋ'. Therefore, in the
case of perfective aspect the negated verb takes the form of telic verbs as
in (183a) below, while in the case of imperfective aspect the negated
form takes the form of atelic verb as in (183b) (see 4.4.2.4).

chapter will focus on the the processes of nominalizing the nouns and the
major categories from which they are derived from. In addition, the
compound nouns will be described in detail.","[281, 282, 283]"
"313The Tima pronominal system played a great role in the formation of the
verbal word. That is, the pronominal person markers (subject and/or
object) were obligatory on the verb, and without them the meaning of the
verb is incomplete (i.e. according to the syntactic function of the
participants).
The pronominal person markers usually fuse with the markers that
distinguish tense, aspect and mood and they form together a
portemanteau morpheme. Therefore, a separate section has been added in
order to discuss this phenomenon in the language. Tima has a binary
tense system, i.e. it has a two-way distinction, between future and nonfuture. Tima relies heavily on the aspect distinction, i.e. on the
perfectivity and imperfectivity of an action or event. This aspect in Tima
is morphologically marked by different morphemes (e.g. progressive,
habitual, iterative, etc.). With regard to mood, Tima has a number of
different mood types such as imperative, hortative, subjunctive, indicative
and veridical mood. Most of them are marked morphologically.
The verb extensions, as one of the prominent features of Niger-Congo
languages, were discussed elaborately for Tima. The description focused
on the derivational processes that derive verbs out of other verbs. This is
done through a number of different affixes (suffixes) on the verb in
addition to pluractional marking which is marked by different strategies
in the language, including vertical (non-concatenative) morphology.
The chapter concluded by presenting the two different strategies of verbal
negation: (i) with the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic'Vŋ'
and (ii) with the negative expression 'amaŋ'. It is found that Tima has a314common strategy of negating declarative sentences, which is the first one
mentioned above. Moreover, the form of negated sentences depends on
the aspect distinction, e.g. whether it is perfective or imperfective. In the
latter, the negation-marking expression 'amaŋ' is used.
Chapter five covered all the different types of nominal derivation. It is
divided into two main parts. The first part showed how nouns are derived
mainly from verbs and adjectives, besides the diminutive, reduplicated
and ideophonic nouns which do not derive from verbs. It has covered,
first, the structure of verbal nouns and how they differ in their structure
from the common nouns found in Tima. They were classified into
different classes according to their endings. In addition, the different
functions of the verbal nouns were illustrated.
The agentive nouns were included, whereby different types have been
used in order to express the concept of someone who does an action. It
was found that they are formed in most cases by a combination of a
verbal noun and bound elements. In other cases, they are formed
independently from the bound elements.
Abstract nouns were also shown in this chapter. They divided into two
types. The first type included nouns which are derived from verb roots.
They are formed by the processes of prefixation and suffixation. The
second type was derived from adjectives by a process of prefixation. In
addition, other types of nominalized nouns were diminutive, reduplicated
and ideophonic nouns have been presented.
The second part of the chapter has covered the compounding of nouns as
another process of noun formation. Different types of compounds were315found in Tima, such as endocentric, exocentric and co-ordinate
compounds. Each one was dealt with in isolation in order to present its
common structure and the way it behaved in the language.
There are still several areas which have not been covered yet. Therefore,
the study demands further investigation, especially with regard to the
Tima verbal system.","[334, 335, 336, 337]"
"2.4.1 Verb structure
Usually, the verb consists of a number of morphemes which express
different grammatical categories plus the verb root. The output verb form
is referred to as a verb stem. For instance, the English verb 'look' is
considered as a verb root where the verb 'look' plus the '-ed' past marker
form the verb stem 'looked'. The order of morphemes in the verb differs
from one language to another. Some of them appear either as prefixes/
suffixes or as infixes. If one looks at Swahili verb structure (an SVO
language), different slots are occupied by different morphological
categories,forexample,subjectagreement-Tense/Aspect-(objectagreement)-verb root-(derivational suffixes)-mood vowel. Tima verb
structure is much more complicated than the Swahili verb structure. The
Tima verb, in its most complex form, contains more than ten slots
expressing different grammatical categories, such as the following:
(negative marker) - aspect marker - proclitic subject marker – tense - verb
root - (derivational suffixes) - (object marker) - enclitic subject marker (negative marker) (see 4.2 on the verb as a word structure). These various
slots on the verb express different types of inherent grammatical
categories associated with the verb such as subject/object marker (i.e.
person markers), TAM, derivational affixes. These grammatical35categories of the verb will be discussed below with reference to their
occurrence mainly in African languages.","[56, 57]"
"The subjunctive form in Tima is formed by the prefix 'i-' for the 1st person
plural inclusive on the verb. This subjunctive mood in Tima is also clear
in the negative subjunctive mood (see also 4.6). They express weak
obligations. It is highly productive and systematic. The examples are:
(118)1st Pl incl

'let's bring s.th'b) ɪ-daa'let's run'c) ɪ-hʊdɔnɔ'let's sit down'd) ɪ-hɘlak'let's remain seated'The structure of the subjunctive forms can be represented by the
following formula.a) 1st pl incl:ɪ-stem
2084.4.3.3 Indicative mood
Indicative mood is used to assert a proposition as a fact. It is also referred
to as declarative mood (Whaley, 1997). The indicative mood in Tima is
morphologically unmarked. It constitutes the most basic sentence type.
Therefore, it is not marked for modality.
The indicative form in Tima is unmarked morphologically.The common
word order for indicative sentences is SVO as in (119). Tima has another
word order according to the focusing/topicalization on certain
constituents of a sentence. The other word orders are: OV(S) as in (120),
VSO or SOV (Dimmendaal, 2009) 16.

It is used to show the speaker's certainty about the occurrence of an
action. In Tima, the so-called certainty mood/form is marked by the
proclitic 'kV' which usually precedes the future marker 'dV-' in the
sentence. The full paradigm of certainty mood is shown in (121).
16The Tima word-orders need more investigation from a syntactic point of view.","[229, 230]"
"If the imperative verb stem takes a direct object (i.e. if it is a transitive
verb), the second enclitic negative marker is encliticized to the end of the
clause. That is, it negates the whole clause as in (179).",[279]

represented in a linear order as follows:
(NEG)- (AM) - (PM) - (TM) - (PM) - R - DSs - (OM) – (SM) - (NEG).
As mentioned in 2.4 earlier, each affix or clitic on the verb adds a
semantic connotation to the basic meaning of the verbal root. The various
slots in the verb structure as shown in Table (4.1) will be briefly
described.
Slot 1 and 12 are occupied by negative markers. The negative marker in
slot 1 'kV' is considered as a proclitic which is usually fused with the
pronominal marker 'PM' (when there is no aspect marker), whereas the
negative marker in slot 12 '-Vŋ' is considered as an enclitic. Their
occurrence is obligatory when they negate a verb phrase/clause (see
Section 4.6). For example:
(4)
ka-mɔɔk-ɔŋNEGR 'drink'NEG'do not drink'
Slot 2 contains aspect and mood markers. This slot is filled by different
markers according to aspect and mood (for mood markers see Section
4.4.3.4). In the case of aspect, it is either filled by the progressive marker
'cʌ' or the stative aspect marker 'a' (Section 4.4). The aspect markers
always fuse with the person marker e.g. 'N' in slot 3 (4.3.2.1); they form a
144portmanteau morpheme as in (5). The person marker appears in the case
of the 1st person singular, 3rd person singular/plural (the person marker 'N'
harmonizes with the following consonant) and the morpheme 'na-' in the
case of 2nd person plural, see example (6).

(6)
ca-na-cɛrcɛr-(ak)-nanASPPMR 'write'SM'you (Pl) are writing'Slot 4 contains the tense marker 'dV-'. This prefix indicates future tense.
It is also fused with the morpheme in slot 5, which refers to person
marker, parallel to the fusion between tense and aspect/mood in slot 2 and
the person marker in slot 3. Usually, these four slots combine together in
forming the verb structure in Tima. This is shown in (7a and b).
(7a)

"19Therefore, languages usually use such types of morphological processes
in order to express different morphological functions, such as number,
case, polarity, etc. For instance, Asheron (a Niger-Kordofanian language)
uses the prefixes for number marking on nouns, in addition to other
prefixes which are attached to the adjectives in order to show agreement
between the noun and the adjective in a noun phrase (Alamin, 2003).
Similarly, the words in Tima are built up by a large number of affixes.
For example, Tima has a number of noun-class prefixes which attach to
the root in order to distinguish between singular and plural nouns (e.g. the
'kV-' classes for singular and the prefix 'i-' and its allomorphs for plural
nouns) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.1). Moreover, Tima makes heavy use of
suffixes which show different functions, especially with regard to the
verb extensions (verbal derivations), such as suffixes that are used to
derive a causative verb from other verb (e.g. –ik) (see 4.5.1.3), the
transitive suffix '-i' (see 4.5.1.1), the instrumental suffix '-aa' (see
4.5.1.4), ventive suffix '-Vŋ' (see 4.5.2.4), etc.","[40, 41]"
"162.1.2 Clitics
Halpern (1998) stated that the distinction between independent
words/phrases and affixes is clear. But there are various formatives in
many languages that are hardly classified as full words or affixes. These
formatives are often called 'clitics'. Moreover, Bubenik (1999: 23)
pointed out that ""clitics are viewed as falling between full-fledged words
and grammatical affixes. Full-fledged words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs) carry lexical accent and their lexical meaning is of symbolic
nature; on the other hand, adpositions, articles, particles and pronouns do
not carry accent and their lexical meaning is of indexical nature"".
Obviously, the phonological criterion only plays a role in languages using
stress. The clitics are of two types: proclitic, which precedes the host, and
enclitic, which follows the host. For instance, the definite article in
English is a proclitic 'the=man' while its counterpart in Romanian is an
enclitic 'om=ul' 3 .
The status of clitics as occupying an intermediate position between full
words and affixes is also reflected in varying spelling conventions of
various languages. For example, in French the pronominal clitics are
hyphenated in the imperative. Anther way of writing clitics is found in
Spanish where the pronominal clitics are written together with their verb,
i.e. they are written as one word. The same is true for Arabic where the
conjuction 'and' and other prepositions are spelled as proclitics.","[37, 38]"
"On the otherhand, mood may be marked by using auxiliaries as the case in English.
The situation in Tima is similar to the former type, where the Tima
imperative and the indicative are morphologically unmarked (i.e. carry a
zero morpheme), the subjunctive mood is morphologically marked on
38verb by a prefix (i-). Certainty is marked by a proclitic on verbs (kV-)
(see 4.4.3). In addition, the interrogative mood is also marked by a
particle on the verb or in the final position of a clause; it is mainly a
vowel.
In the preceding paragraphs, each category of tense, aspect and mood was
taken and discussed independently from each other. But there is a very
important fact that linguists should pay great attention to when doing
their linguistic fieldwork. The fact is that there is an overlap between
tense, aspect and mood as grammatical categories of the verb. They
usually act together in the inflection system of a language and it is often
difficult to tease them apart (Payne, 1997). More precisely, Katamba
(1993:223) states that ""the categories of tense, aspect and mood are not
entirely independent of each other. So they are often simultaneously
signaled by the same form. For instance, an event that is already
completed at the moment of speaking is also in the past tense …"".
This is also true for Tima, where the morphological markers of tense,
aspect and mood can not be separated from each other. For instance, The
Tima perfective aspect form which indicates the completion of an action
is also used in reference to the past tense. Likewise, the Tima
imperfective aspect form (including the progressive and habitual aspect)
which indicates the noncompletion of an action is also used in reference
to the present. Moreover, the form of certainty mood which indicates the
temporal nature of a linguistic utterance is also used with reference to the
future tense (see 4.4.1.1) and it also interacts with the aspectual form
indicating incomplete action (i.e. imperfective aspect).","[59, 60]"
"1.2 Language name and communityThe name Tima seems to be derived from one of the villages where this
language is spoken. The village name is 'tɨmmʌ', (Dimmendaal, 2009).
This name is used by other inhabitants of the Nuba Mountains including

native speakers and it is widely used in the literature, i.e. this language
name is well known to the outsiders and linguists. Tima people refer to3their language as 'du-murik'. It also has several alternative names used by
others neighboring groups when referring to Tima speakers, such as:
Lomoriki, Tamanik, and Yibwa (Grimes, 1984).","[24, 25]"

associated with other verbal nouns in order to describe a person's quality.

adjective in a predicate position in order to describe a person's quality.
The examples are:

STAT-clean'cleaver person (lit. the head is clean)'Type 2: Agentive nouns with 'arɔŋ'The agentive nouns found in this class are formed by the bound word
'arɔŋ' which means 'like' plus the verbal nouns. This combination of
agentive nouns is formed by a kind of adjectival compound clause which
means 'who/which likes something (see 5.2 on compounding). The word
'arɔŋ' is considered as a bound morpheme because it has no meaning
when it occurs in isolation and it is not found in any other construction in
Tima. This means it is exclusively used with verbal nouns to derive
agentive nouns. Thus, the new compound nouns describe a person who
does an action unintentionally. This means that one can do/perform the
action as a habit. The others describe that person on that ground, but the
meaning usually conveys a negative connotation. The examples are:284(32)

'arɔŋ'. But some of them are nevertheless derived from verb roots. They
actually resemble the verbal nouns in their forms. Agentive nouns in this
case are different. because of the changes that concern the tone levels
(Bashir forthcoming). The agentive nouns take a low tone levels
compared with the verbal nouns that take high tone. For example:
(33)
ANglossa) kʊhaal'a field guard'b) kʊdadɪɪ'theif'c) kʌɽheel'a carpenter'd) kawataal'a porter'e) kɔdɔwa'a lawyer'On the other hand, a few examples of the agentive nouns do not seem to
be derived from any other word classes and they are purely nouns which
describe professions as in (34).","[304, 305, 306]"
"Type 1: Compounds with 'arɔŋ'Compounds can also be formed by a bound word 'arɔŋ', which means
'one who likes'. The word 'arɔŋ' must attach to a noun in order to give a
full meaning. Thus, the result is agentive noun, as can be seen in (65) (see
5.1.2). It always carries a negative connotation.

c) arɔŋ kwaal'dancer (lit. one who likes dancing)'Type 2: Compounds with 'kimin'Tima has a number of compound nouns that are formed by the bound
element 'kimin' which is used in the language to indicate diminutive (see3075.1.4). It is also found that the diminutive can be associated with other
noun in order to derive a new meaning. The examples are:

It precedes the noun and it can not stand by itself; i.e. it can not be used in
isolation but it should be attached to a noun and in such a combination the
bound word 'yan' means 'things'. The bound word 'yan' is usually used in
its collective form.

"311General Summary
This study is divided into five chapters. The following part gives a
summary of what has been described in each chapter.
Chapter one was an introductory notes which gave a brief background on
the classification of the language and the Tima community. The reasons
behind the complex linguistic situation in the Tima area were considered
with reference to the general linguistic situation in Sudan. In addition, the
chapter included some notes about the previous studies that have been
done in the Nuba Mountains; The methods of collecting the data were
illustrated, the way of presenting the data through out this study was
stated.
Chapter two has covered all the necessary information that is required in
discussing the word structure of a language like Tima. It described first
how the word is defined from a linguistic point of view (2.1.1); in
addition, the most important operations (2.2.1) that build up the words in
languages have been discussed with examples from other languages and
with reference to the Tima language as well. Sections (2.3) and (2.4)
handled the two major categories found in this language: the noun and the
verb. The major inherent grammatical categories associated with each
class have been described and discussed elaborately. The final output of
the verbal categories reveals that one can classify the language according
to the way syntactic and semantic relations are expressed; this
information may be expressed mainly on the verb, in which we are
dealing with a head-marking language at the clausal level, or,
alternatively, on noun phrases expressing different semantic roles, in
which we are dealing with a dependent-marking language (2.4.2).
312Chapter three was divided into two main sections. Section 3.1 discussed
the concept of noun classes in Tima. All productive and unproductive
noun classes of Tima have been analyzed. The number marking system
(the formation of singular and plural) of these classes has also been
illustrated. In addition, the forms of kinship terms (3.1.9) have been
presented and the way they mark the plural counterparts has been
discussed.
Section (3.2) described all the nominal modifiers as found in Tima. Their
position relative to the head noun which they modify has been shown, in
addition to their behavior with regard to the number of noun they modify.
Finally, a brief description of the NPs in Tima has been presented and the
final formula of all modifiers which are associated with nouns has been
stated.
Chapter four described, illustrated and analyzed all the morphological and
morphosyntactic features which are found in Tima so far. The chapter
starts by presenting the structure of Tima verbs. It was found that most of
the verbs are monosyllabic, in addition to a less numerous group of
disyllabic verb root. Trisyllabic verb roots are rare. In addition, the
structure of Tima verb stems has been presented, which contains, in
addition to the verbal root, other affixes or clitics. The presence of these
affixes or clitics on the verb forms the complex structure of the Tima
verbs. The stem/verb-word consisted of 12 slots, all together forming the
verb as a phonological and grammatical word. This complexity of verbs
has enabled us to classify the Tima as a typically head-marking language
at the clause level.","[332, 333, 334]"
"These quantifiers are used as modifiers of a head noun of an NP. They
modify plural nouns only and they never occur with singular nouns in121order to show the plurality of that singular noun. This means that the
quantifiers in Tima show an agreement in number with the nouns they
modify. For example:
(100)
a)i-warmadɘhi-hʌt̪t̪ʌmNC.pl-manpl-many/a lot of'many/a lot of men'b) y-ʌhunen
NC.pl-womanɪ-bɛʔɛŋ
pl-a few'a few women'c) ø-imi
NC.pl-goatɪ-hwaa
pl-all' all goats'd) i-bʌrimbʌri
NC.pl-childerngɛŋ
all'all childern'e) ɪ-ʃahɪ
NC.pl-teai-hʌt̪t̪ʌm
pl-much'much tea'It is clear from example (100) that the form of quantifiers does not
change according to the nature of the noun they modify, i.e. whether
these nouns are countable (100a, b, c and d) or uncountable (100e). The
quantifier 'gɛŋ' seems to take the zero plural prefix 'ø-'.This is due to the122fact that all quantifiers in Tima modify only plural nouns and they must
take plural marker in order to agree with the nouns they modify. That is
Tima quantifiers do not have a singular form.
These quantifiers are positioned after the nouns they qualify. Thus, the
rule is:
NP→ N + Quant
3.2.4 Demonstratives
The basic function of demonstratives is to point out the spatial position of
some entity with regard to the speaker and the hearer. A language usually
displays a two/three-way distinction among demonstrative modifiers:
near the speaker, near the hearer and/or far from both speaker and hearer
(Croft, 1990). Demonstratives in Tima form a closed class 8. As
demonstratives always express distance, Tima has three degrees of
distance. The demonstratives have the following forms:
-nʌ'this/these; near the speaker and hearer'-ya'that/those; far from the speaker and hearer or near the hearer'-ya luy'that/those far away from both the speaker and hearer but it is still
visible'Unlike many class languages (e.g. Swahili and Fulfulde), Tima, has no
number agreement between nouns and the demonstrative modifiers in a
noun phrase, except when they are used elliptically, as will be seen in8There are no 'articles' in Tima.","[142, 143, 144]"
"2.4.2 Head-marking language
Having completed discussing the most important inflectional categories
(pronominal markers, TAM, negation) and derivational categories on
verbs (DAs and pluractional), we are now in a position to classify a
43language like Tima on the base of this information. A language which has
such a rich inflection and derivation system is classified as a headmarking language versus a dependent-marking language like Ghulfan, a
Nubian language spoken north of Tima. In a head-marking language the
verb as the head of the clause/sentence carries all the information with
regard to person markers, TAM, and derivational operations expressing
the different semantic roles involved in the structure of the verb. On the
other hand, dependent-marking languages usually makes distinction
between subject and object (i.e. the syntactic function of a noun) by way
of morphological case markers on nouns (e.g. nominative-accusative
case, as in Latin (Corbett, 1998) or the Nubian language Ghulfan for that
matter.
This type of head-marking language is exactly observed in a number of
Nilo-Saharan languages with a verb-initial syntax as well as a verb- final
syntax, for example in Nilotic and Surmic languages (Dimmendaal,
2000). In addition, a number of SVO languages in Niger-Congo family
are classified as head-marking languages. Dependent-marking languages
are less common in the Nuba Mountains, but may be found among NiloSaharan languages (e.g. Nubian) and in some of the central Chadic
languages (e.g Berber, Omotic, Cushitic and Ethio-Semitic languages
(Creissels et al, 2008).
Accordingly, Tima is considered as a head-marking language. The
complex form of the verb with its various slots carries all the information
required with regard to the number of arguments in a sentence and other
valency operations mentioned above. Therefore, the Tima verb can be
treated as forming a complete clause/sentence without any need for other
sentence's constituents to be mentioned (see 4.2).
44It has been argued that Tima has a very complicated system with regard
to its verb constructions. This is clear from the large number of slots
which are occupied in forming the verb as a word category.
The next chapter will consider the noun and its modifiers which are found
in Tima as a starting point of analyzing.","[64, 65, 66]"
"204(113)
c-ɪt̪ɪa-rdiNC.sg-clothSTAT.sg-red'the cloth is red'On the other hand, the verbs in Tima usually marked by the stative aspect
marker 'a-/ɪ-' express the perfectivity of an action/event. In this case, the
stative marker precedes the verb root plus the pronominal marker
(subject). An example is:
(114)
an-diy-ʌŋ
ASP(stative).3sg-come-Ven

This section will shed light on the different types of moods (see 2.4.1.2
on mood types) found in Tima. The imperative form will be described in
4.4.3.1. The subjunctive form will be shown in 4.4.3.2. The indicative
will be presented in 4.4.3.3 with regard to the word order in Tima
sentences. Section 4.4.3.4 will briefly show how the interrogative is
formed in Tima. Negation will be discussed separately in section (4.6).","[225, 226]"

The agentive nouns in Tima can be classified into three types according
to their semantic structure: (i) agentive nouns that describe a person who
does the action intentionally, (ii) agentive nouns that describe one who
does an action unintentionally and (iii) the one who does an action as a
profession. Each type has its own way of forming the agentive nouns. In
most cases, agentive nouns are derived from verbs. In other cases, they
are formed by adding a bound morpheme (e.g. arɔŋ, 'like') which
sometimes carry a negative connotation. A few Tima agentive nouns do
not seem to be derived from any other word classes; i.e. they are nouns by
themselves that express an occupation or profession.
281Type 1: Agentive nouns with 'kay'The agentive nouns that fall in this class are derived mainly from verb
roots. The element 'kay' precedes the verb form expressing the action.
The action nouns are the same as verbal nouns. Thus, the agentive nouns
are formed by adding 'kay' to the verbal/action nouns 3 . The construction
of agentive noun in this case indicates that the agent is doing the action
intentionally. The examples are:
(28)
ANglossVNglossa) kay mɔhɔl'one who has evil eye' mɔhɔl'magic'b) kay kʊhʊrɛɛl'slaughterer'kʊhʊrɛɛl'slaughtering (feast)'c) kay katʊkwɛɛl'hunter'katʊkwɛɛl'hunting'd) kay kuturuweel 'swimmer'kuturuweel 'swimming'e) kay wuri'fighter/hero'kuri'force/power'f) kay ɽumeel'killer/murder'kutumeel'killing'g) kay ʊranɪɪ'runner'kʊɽanɪɪ'running'It is noticed that the last three examples in (28) above (the verbal nouns
with the element 'kay') undergo certain phonological changes when
compared with the other verbal nouns in the third column. That is. there
is a deletion of the initial consonant 'k' of the verbal noun when forming
the agentive nouns (Bashir forthcoming).
It has been noticed that the word 'kay' is combined with the noun, the tone levels are usually different
(this is a general remark during the fieldwork). The verbal nouns take high tone when they are used in3isolation, whereas the same verbal nouns take low tone levels when the word 'kay' is used ( Bashir
forthcoming).","[301, 302, 303]"
"993.1.12 Kinship terms
Most of the kinship terms are inherently singular. The singular forms are
morphologically unmarked, i.e. these terms take a zero prefix in the
singular forms (ø-), whereas the plural forms are formed by adding the
productive plural prefix 'ɪ-/i-' to the unmarked singular forms. For
example:
(67)
Singular
ø-wayɛnPlural
i-l-wayɛnGloss
father/sø-wɛɛnɪ-l-waanmother/sø-pawʊŋɪ-wawʊŋgrandparent/sø-palɪɪ-walɪwife/sø-mamʊŋɪ-mamʊŋmaternal uncle/sø-mamiɪ-mamɪco-wife/sø-luwii-luwisister/sø-hahamɔŋɪ-hahamɔŋrelatives in law/sø-ŋʌluuŋi-ŋʌluuŋsister child/childrenIt is noticeable that the word 'wɛɛn. sg', 'mother' undergoes some internal
change of a vowel stem in forming the plural (e.g. i-l-waan). The vowel
/ɛɛ/is changed into /aa/. Then, the particle -l- is inserted between the
plural prefix ɪ- and the root. The insertion of the particle /-l-/is also found
with a word for 'father' which is 'ø-wayɛn/i-l-wayɛn'. The inserted
particle /-l-/in both words for 'mother' and 'father' has something similar100to that locative marker /-l-/found with possessive pronouns (see 3.2.5.1
for different forms of the Tima possessive pronouns) 5. The initial
consonant /p/in 'pʌwuŋ', 'grandparent' and 'palɪ', 'wife' is changed into a
labial glide 'w' in forming the plural; 'ɪ-wʌwuŋ', 'grandparents' and 'ɪwalɪ', 'wives'. This process is called lenition, which again is also
widespread among other African languages (Bashir forthcoming).
A few kinship terms mark the singular forms by using one of the singular
noun-class prefixes, parallel to the common nouns in Tima. For instance:
(68)
Singular
k-waanPlural
ɪ-waanGloss
brother/sk-inʌø-inʌmaternal cousin/skɘ-daaɪdaabrother from female side/sku-wʌwuŋi-wʌwuŋgrandchild/sc-ɛɽɘry-ɛɽɘrbrother in law/sIn addition, the Tima language uses different kinship terms as modifiers
with other nouns in order to refer to other kinship terms that do not have
unique terms. In this respect Tima resembles some other African
languages, such as Nilotic languages. For example:
(69) cibʌ ku-waan/ibʌ ɪ-waan'brother's child/childern'Another example has been found which follows the same way of forming the plural. The noun 'akaŋ'
is used to refer to unspecified person or the speaker does not want to mention someone's name. The
plural is 'i-l-akaŋ' which means 'the group of that person'.","[120, 121, 122]"
"2.4.1.2 Tense/Aspect/Mood
Tense, aspect and mood are the most important inherent categories of
verbs. They are inflected on verb by means of different grammatical
processes such as affixation, stem modification, reduplication or
suppletion. With regard to tense, languages usually make distinctions of
events according to the time of speech. Comrie (1985) mentions that
some languages make a three-way distinction for tense: past, present and
future; for example English and Swahili. Other languages make a twoway distinction: either between past vs non-past or future vs. non-future;
for example Dyirbal (Australian, northern Queensland) and Hua (a
language of New Guinea). Accordingly, Tima can be characterized as a
language that makes a two-way distinction between future and nonfuture. The future in Tima is morphologically marked by a prefix 'dV-'
whereas the non-future (which includes the past and present tense) is
morphologically unmarked, i.e. has a zero morpheme (see 4.4).
According to Comrie (1976), aspect (unlike tense) is concerned with the
internal structure of the situation. Therefore, verbs in a language can be
classified according to their aspectual categories. The distinction is
usually made between perfective vs. imperfective, dynamic vs. stative,
habitual, progressive, and inceptive aspect. These aspectual categories are
in most cases marked morphologically on verbs and in other cases they
are marked analytically or lexically (see Payne, 1997).
37Another prominent feature which is associated with aspectual
grammatical categories is 'aktionsart'; in other contexts this inflectional
category is referred to as lexical aspect (Comrie, 1981). Whaley (1997:
214) mentions that ""aktionsart plays an important role in determining
how time reference in a sentence is understood"". Thus, a verb conveys an
inherent aspectual meaning of being extended or not extended in time.
The English verb 'read' as an example is durative and this means that the
action described by the verb lasts for a certain period of time, whereas the
verb 'sneeze' is punctual, because the event happens instantaneously.
Accordingly, Bybee (1985) states that languages appear to have different
aktionsart classes, for example: punctual, iterative, durative, stative,
achievement and accomplishment.
Mood ('modality', or 'mode') is another important category of a verb. It is
defined by Crystal (1991: 223) as ""a grammatical category through which
the speakers of a language can indicate whether they believe that an event
or state actually occurs, does not occur, or has the potential to occur"".
Traditionally, grammarians and linguists categorize a sentence into major
types based on mood. These types are: indicative, imperative,
subjunctive, and interrogative mood. These categories may be signaled by
alternative inflectional forms of the verb. For example, in Alaaba (a
Cushitic language spoken in Ethiopia) mood is marked morphologically
on verbs especially in the case of directive and optative, while the
indicative mood is unmarked (Schneider-Blum, 2007).","[58, 59]"
"The 'lV-' class denotes location. Tima people refer to the place where they
live as 'l-umurik', 'Tima area'. The other Kordofanian languages use the
same prefix to refer to locations. The example from MacDiarmid and
MacDiarmid (1931) and Stevenson (1956) is: 'l-ukha', 'a place where a
language of the Heiban group is spoken'In addition, Tima has a 'bV-' class which resembles the same noun class
that is found in Swahili. It denotes abstract nouns for which enumeration33is irrelevant. The example from Tima is: 'ba-mmɔl', 'goodness/beauty'
(see 5.1.3).
With regard to the phenomenon of agreement which is usually associated
with noun class systems, Tima has a different system of agreement
between a noun as a head and its modifiers in the NPs. That is, the
agreement in Tima between the noun and modifiers like demonstrative,
adjectives, numerals and other quantifiers occurs with regard to number;
i.e. if the head noun of the NP is a singular the rest of modifiers should be
in their singular forms and vice versa (for further illustration, see 3.2).
To sum up, Tima has a noun class system which differs completely from
the systems found in most of the Bantu languages and Kordofanian
languages with regard to the number of classes and the concept of
associating each noun with a certain semantic class. Therefore, all the
noun class prefixes function as members of singular-plural pairs, while
there are other classes referring to locative nouns, the class of language
names and the abstract nouns. Having finished presenting the major
inflectional categories of nouns (that of number and noun class), it is
essential to also mention the inherent grammatical categories as found on
verbs.
2.4 The verb
This section presents and discusses the structure of the verb with regard
to the most common inherent grammatical/morphological categories
which are associated with it. In most languages, especially African
languages, the most complicated word structure is found with regard to34the verb. All the information about arguments indexation (pronominal
markers), TAM distinctions, negation and verb extensions are encoded on
the verb by means of affixes or by other word formation processes (see
2.2.1). This complexity is found in languages which have a very rich
inflection system, such as found in the Niger-Congo languages (e.g.
Swahili).","[54, 55, 56]"
"2.1.1 The notion of a word
It is difficult to give a precise definition of what is meant by a word.
Therefore, a number of linguists have been trying to define the word with
reference to various criteria. Firstly, the phonological criterion identifies
and defines the word from different angles. At one point, the word is
defined as a sequence of sounds which is associated with particular
meaning. For example, the word 'brother' consists of a number of sounds
associated with a specific meaning ('male sibling’).
On the other hand, the phonological criteria state that the word is
phonologically marked in some way. One way is that a language can
segment the phonetic strings in a word by the so called word-accent. The
word-accent helps a lot in specifying the word boundaries. For instance,
in French the accent can fall only on the last pronounced syllable of the
word (with the exception of the reduced schwa 'ə') (Palmer, 1981) 2 . Thus,
the appearance of such an accent indicates that there is a word boundary
somewhere before the next unaccented vowel.
Another way of defining wordhood, also based on a phonological
criterion, involves identifying the potentiality of pausing between words
in a sentence (to help the analyst or the learner). This criterion helps in
dividing the sentence into several words (Matthews, 1991). All the above
2This phonological criterion is encountered with a problem. That is, the accent in French sometimes
marks the whole phrase instead of a single word (for more explanation, see Anderson 1985a).",[36]

Adv:whendiy-ʌŋ-aa-ŋaŋ-ɪibʌrimbʌricɛn-daalacome-Ven-Incep-2sg-FOCchildrenPROG-3pl-play'when you came the children were playing'Tima has another way of expressing progressive past. It is expressed
lexically by a verb 'amʊh' which means 'leave'. According to the
speakers such a way of forming progressive past indicates that somebody
had a past habit and now has given up performing that habit. The
sentence in this case is expressed in the past tense, and the verb 'amʊh' in
all cases is followed by a noun.

'I used to go to the Tima area'4.4.2.2 Habitual aspect
Generally, habitual aspect -unlike the progressive aspect- expresses the
fact that it is not necessary for an action to be taking place at the speech178time, but it usually occurs from time to time or it is extended over a long
period of time (Comrie, 1976). In Tima, the habitual aspect is not
distinguished from the progressive aspect; both are expressed by the same
marker 'cʌ-' as a proclitic on verbs. This case is not strange, because
Tima speakers treat the habitual actions as imperfective actions as as they
do with progressive actions. To be more precise, a given situation is
viewed as being both habitual and progressive. In this case the speakers
differentiate between the habitual and progressive aspect by using
adverbials of time such as 'tɔttɔk', 'always/often/ usually'. Compare
example (60), which expresses a habitual aspect with an example in (61)
which expresses a progressive aspect.

aspect marker 'cʌ', but it morphologically looks the same as the present
forms. In this case the habitual forms are unmarked. The examples below
are taken from 'the story of myth'.","[198, 199, 200]"
"2.2 The structure of words
As mentioned above, the word can be viewed as strings of sounds
associated with meaning. This is clear if one tries to analyze a word like
'rats', where it consists of a phonological sequence 'rat' and 's'. The
meaning of this form is decomposable into two parts: semantically it
refers to a class of small rodents and it refers to plurality. The structure of
the word 'rat+s' is transparent; but the situation is more complicated and
difficult with regard to another example like 'mice' with its singular
counterpart 'mouse'. It is clear here that only the /m/ at the beginning and
/s/ at the end are shared between the two forms. The problem occurs with
regard to the idea of plurality. The plurality is expressed inside the word18(internally) by the process of a vowel alternation. One can explain the
relation between 'mouse' and 'mice' as follows: the vowel /ai/ marks the
singular and /au/ marks the plural. Thus, the formula in this case is that
the plural is formed by replacing /ai/ with /au/. This relation forms the
word's shape and structure (Anderson, 1985a).
The two examples of rats and mice show that the word is structured by
different operations referred to as 'morphological processes' (such as
vowel alternations, affixes, etc). They usually reflect the grammatical
categories of the word (such as number, case, tense, aspect, etc.). These
morphological processes share in building up the structure of word
(Matthews, 1991). The following paragraphs will handle each of these
morphological processes in details and show how they share in word
structure in general and in Tima in particular.","[39, 40]"
"212.2.1.3 Reduplication
Reduplication is a process which affects the word structure by copying all
(full reduplication) or part of the phonological material of the root (partial
reduplication). The repeated part is formed either to the left or to the
right. Reduplication processes play a grammatical role when occurring
within the word. In many languages they function as plurality markers
(e.g. in Malay, an Asian language, organ means 'man' and organ-organ
means 'men' (Bubenik, 1999) and in other languages it marks diminutive/
augmentative (e.g. Nyimang, a language of the Nuba Mountains.
(Stevenson, 1956).
Tima has a large number of reduplicated words; most of them represent
full reduplication and a few represent partial reduplication. Thus, the
form of reduplicated words can be found in all word categories/classes
mainly in nouns and verbs. It is important to mention that the
reduplication of nouns does not play a morphological role, i.e. it does not
mark the plurality. So the reduplicated form can be found in both singular
and plural forms (see 5.1.5). On the other hand, reduplication plays a
grammatical role when occurring with verbs. Therefore, reduplicated
verbs in Tima mark aspectual distinctions, especially with the
pluractional forms (see 4.5.1.2).
There are two processes of word formations associated with reduplicated
nouns. These are: haplology and back formation. They are considered as
phonological processes where their distribution varies among the world's
languages. According to the literature, these two processes are found in
many Indo-European languages (e.g. English and Latin), but they have
not been attested on the literature of African languages before.
22Consequently, Tima is now considered as one of the African languages
that uses such processes in their word structure/word-formation process.
Back formation is defined as the process of creating new words by
removing some part of a morphologically simple word that is incorrectly
analyzed as a morpheme, especially an affix (Akmajian, 2001). The back
formation can be illustrated by the word 'pronunciation' from English.
The university students simply assumed that the verb corresponding to
this noun is 'pronunciate'. Other back formations examples include the
verbs 'typewrite', 'baby-sit' and 'edit' which are back formed from the
nouns 'typewriter', 'baby-sitter' and 'editor' respectively (Finegan, 2004).
The back formation process has been found with regard to the formation
of Tima nouns in their plural forms. The speakers analyze the nouns
which start with initial velar consonant 'k-/kV-' as one of the noun class
prefixes and consequently they replace the initial velar consonant from
the nominal root by the plural noun class prefix 'i-/y-'. For instance, the
Arabic loan noun 'k-ataw' in Tima which means 'book' is consider as a
singular noun which is formed by the singular class prefix 'k-'. Therefore,
the plural is formed by replacing the singular class 'k-' by the plural
allomorph prefix 'y-' which yield 'y-ataw', 'books' (for more examples see
5.1.5, 5.1.6 and 5.1.1).
Haplology is another type of word formation process. It is defined as ""a
special type of dissimilatory loss of a whole syllable before or after a
phonetically similar or identical syllable"" (Hock, 1991: 109). For23instance, the Latin word 'nutrix', 'nurse' undergoes haplology where the
regular feminine agent noun should be 'nutri-trix'. This form should not
be like this because of the identical syllable in word final position.
Therefore, the word is formed only with one of the two identical syllables
in order to avoid the repetition of similar syllables (Anderson, …).
Similarly, haplology has been found with regard to the formation of
nouns in their singular forms in Tima. The same example of Arabic loan
noun 'kataw', 'book' undergoes haplology. Tima speakers analyze this
noun as having a noun class prefix 'k-/kV-' and they do not consider this
sound as an original part of the noun (i.e. there is no need to add one of
the noun class prefixes to nominal root). Therefore, the exact way of
forming the singular noun should be something like 'ka-kataw'. But this
form is considered as a wrong form. In this case, the speakers avoid the
repetition of identical syllables in the word initial position. For additional
examples of Tima nouns which undergo haplology see 5.1.1 and 5.1.5.","[42, 43, 44, 45]"
"15mentioned phonological criteria may be quite different from one language
to another.
Besides the phonological criteria, there are grammatical criteria that help
in defining and identifying the word. One criterion is based on the idea of
permutation of elements with one another. This situation occurs in a free
word order language like Latin where the elements of a sentence can be
permuted without any change in meaning. Moreover, it is possible to
insert another word between two already existing words. But it is not
possible to insert a word between formatives/morphemes without
changing the meaning (Matthews, 1991).
Another grammatical approach to the definition of the word is based on
the different parts of speech of the word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
and the occurrence of the obligatory categories associated with each
class. Latin nouns, for example, are inflected for case and number, where
Latin verbs are obligatory inflected for tense, aspect and mood. These
grammatical categories help a lot in specifying the word and their class
(Anderson, 1985a).
It is found that there is sometimes a conflict among these different criteria
and one can not depend on one criterion irrespective of the others in order
to have a satisfactory definition of the word. Therefore, one must depend
in one’s definition of a word on all of the criteria together, in order to
have a comprehensive and clear picture of what the word meant. But the
most striking problem concerns the status of words as clitics.","[36, 37]"

which is a widespread phenomenon among languages, for example
English. In a case like this, the future-like interpretation depends on the
nature of the described situation and it is also understood from the
context. Therefore, the future marker 'dV-' in this case disappears from
the verb form (see the present tense in section 4.4.1.2.2). The examples in
(33) express that the speaker is departing, or about to leave. In addition,
the examples in (33) have another interpretation, that is the sentence
indicates the present tense; it can also indicate the habitual aspect by
adding the adverb 'ʈɔʈɔk'.","[183, 184]"

(a Kordofanian language), mainly the structure of the noun and the verb.
Its aim is to fulfill the following two objectives: first, to provide a
comprehensive description of unwritten language. Secondly, to document
Tima as one of the endangered languages in Sudan.
The Linguistic data was collected during formal sessions with two native
speakers, in addition to irregular meetings with the Tima language
committee members in Al Dorushab (North Khartoum). Between 22-30
February 2007, the researcher visited the Tima area in the Nuba
Mountains, where a considerable amount of data was collected.
The study used different techniques for the data collections: elicitation of
word-lists, elicitation of grammatical sentences and a large number of
narratives and procedural texts were recorded and transcribes.
Finally, the study achieved the description of word-structure in Tima with
regard to the different parts of speech that are found in the language. The
main inherent grammatical categories that distinguish each part of speech
were classified and analyzed.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"123example (103) below. The demonstrative modifier '-na' which indicates
distance near the speaker and hearer can occur with /modify both singular
and plural nouns in a nominal phrase without any change in its form (i.e
the demonstratives are invariable even with mass nouns). The same
applies to the demonstrative '–ya' which indicates the distance far from
the speaker. See the examples below:

immediately to the right of the head noun. That is, they are considered as
bound morphemes which are suffixed to nouns. They usually occur closer
to the nominal root. Therefore, they are treated as enclitics on nouns. No
other modifier (e. g adjective, numerals etc) is allowed to separate the
noun from the demonstrative in an NP. The example (102d) is considered
as an ill- noun phrase.","[144, 145]"
"27The way of marking nouns differs from languages to another. That is,
how to derive the plural from the singular or vice versa. It is found that
the base form is not fixed in African languages. According to Gilley
(2000), there are three ways of marking number in Shilluk (a Western
Nilotic, i.e. a Nilo-Saharan language): (i) the singular is considered as the
base form while the plural is marked by a suffix (i.e. the plural is derived
from the unmarked singular), (ii) the plural is the base form while the
singular is also marked by a suffix and (iii) the singular and the plural are
both marked by the process of suffixation.
This situation is also true for Laggori, a Nilo-Saharan language (Alamin,
2006). This system is known as “tripartite system”. In comparison, both
the singular and plural nouns in Tima are marked by the process of
prefixation (see 3.1). Therefore, the plural noun is derived by replacing
the singular noun class by the suitable plural noun-class prefix.
Mass nouns and collective nouns are other categories that mark the nouns
in a language. According to Haspelmath (2002), mass nouns are not
pluralized and they usually take distinctive markers from those of
countable nouns. Considering the class of mass nouns in in different
Nuba Mountains languages (Otorro, Katcha and Nyimang), Stevenson
(1956) observed that they take a distinct class (ŋ- class) from those
referring to singular and plural noun classes (Stevenson, 1956).
The semantic categorization of mass nouns varies from language to
language. It is found that in Indo-European languages, e.g. English, there
is a clear cut distinction between countable and mass nouns, but the case
is different in African languages, where there is continuum between
countable and mass nouns. In the case of Nilo-Saharan languages, it is
28possible to derive a singulative form out of inherently mass nouns by
using one of the singular markers. In Bari, a Nilo-Saharan language, it is
possible to use a singulative suffix '-tat' with a mass noun like 'lɛ', 'milk'
in order to give the form 'lɛ-tat' which means 'a drop of milk'
(Dimmendaal, 2000). This semantic dimension of mass nouns is also
found in the Tima language (see 3.1.3).
Moreover, there are nouns which are inherently plural (referred to as
collective nouns), but it is possible to derive the singular counterpart
expressing an individuated item from a collective or a group by a
singulative number affix (e.g. Baale, a Nilo-Saharan language, spoken in
southern Ethiopia and Sudan). On the other hand, languages may have
inherently singular nouns (they are referred to as singulative nouns).
Thus, one can derive a plural counterpart by attaching a plural marker.
Tima also has such inherently plural nouns (collective) and singulative
nouns (see 3.1.3.1). In addition, it has a third type referred to as singular
forms only, i.e. they do not have plural forms at all (see also 3.1.3.1).","[48, 49, 50]"
"1.7 Presentation of language dataThe Tima language data are presented, for those who want to study/ learn
it, in the following way. In each example, there are three lines: the first
line gives the data in the Tima language. The second line is a word-forword translation into English. It includes a number of abbreviations that
are listed in the list of abbreviation (pp xii). The third line gives a free
translation of phrases and clauses in English so that those who do not
understand Tima can understand the meaning.",[32]
"2.1 The study of word structure
The study of word structure is considered nowadays as one of the most
important and interesting aspects of linguistics especially with regard to
the grammatical description of unknown and unwritten languages.
Therefore, the study of word structure is treated as a starting point in any
phonological, syntactic and semantic analysis of a specific language.
The study of word structure is defined by Anderson (1985b) as the study
of the internal structure of words and the relationship between the parts
that form the word. In a simple way, Katamba (1993) defines the study of
word structure as the study of word shape. Actually, words are built up of
a number of smaller pieces that are called formatives 1 (see 2.1.2). These
definitions of the study of word structure bring up the problem of
1The term 'formatives' is used by Anderson (1985b) in his article on 'typological distinctions in word
formation'. In traditional grammar the term 'morphemes' are used instead of formatives.",[35]
"The study uses different techniques in collecting primary data: firstly, a
collection of word-lists. This word-list is recorded and transferred into
Audiofiles 3 . This helps considerable when trying to listen to the proper
pronunciation of words and sorting out the different noun-class prefixes
found in Tima. The second technique for collecting the data is elicitation.
It mainly helps in describing the various morphological features and the
grammar of a language. The elicitation is done with native speakers by
using both English and Arabic in order to avoid misunderstanding of
sentences. Thirdly, a number of texts were collected and subsequently
written by using the Transcriber program. The stories include stories,
songs and procedural texts. These texts help a lot in identifying the
different types of word classes and sentence structure. In addition, they
support the description and analysis of the most problematic phenomena
found in Tima, such as tense and aspect.",[31]
"2.4.1.5 Pluractional
In the preceding paragraphs the different types of DAs have been
presented. Pluractional marking is also considered as part of the
derivational operations taking place on the verb. But because of its weight
on the verbal morphology of African languages, separate paragraphs are
devoted to introduce and explain this phenomenon. Pluractional is
sometimes referred to as 'number in verb' (Bybee, 1985), 'verbal number'
(Creissels, 2008), or 'plural verb/iterative' (Abu Manga, 1986). It is well
known that nouns/nominals are inflected for number either as singular or
as plural. But there are some languages in which number distinctions are
expressed on the verb.
Pluractional marking usually involves the multiplicity of subjects, objects
or the repetitition of an action itself (Williamson and Blench 2000). For
42this aspect of plurality marking on verbs the term “pluractional” is coined
by Newman (1990) in his study of Chadic verbs (e.g. Kanakuru
language). Such phenomena are also widespread in Niger-Congo
languages. Aaron (1994) has studied verbal number in Obolo (BenueCongo language). He states that languages in general follow different
processes for expressing pluractionals on verbs. Examples of these
processes are: by way of affixes that are attached to the verb root, full or
partial reduplication of the verb root/stem, internal change of the verb
stem, or by using supletive verb forms to indicate plurality. The last
process, i.e. suppletive form is described by Bybee (1985) in her survey
of some languages of the world. She found that in Kung, a language of
southern Africa, there are two forms of verbs. One form is used when the
subject/object is singular and the other form is used when the
subject/object of a sentence is plural.
Likewise, pluractional marking is considered as a prominent feature of
Tima verbal morphology. It uses the same processes mentioned above for
expressing plurals in verbs (see 4.5.1.2). One of the most important facts
is the fact that plurality in Tima does not play only a role on the verb
derivational morphology but is also considered as a major feature in
distinguishing imperfective from perfective aspect. This is due to the fact
that verbal plurality has an inherent meaning of the verb (see 4.4.2.3 on
perfective vs. imperfective).","[63, 64]"
"The 'cʌ-' marker also occurs with a future reference point; it indicates an
imperfectivity of an action (see section 4.4.2.3). Moreover, the
progressive marker 'cʌ-' is used with stative verbs as well as with
dynamic verbs, when it describes a process, for example, 'to become tall'
as in example (52) compared with the same stative verb when it is used in
the past or when it indicates the perfectivity or completion of that
process, as in (53), where the progressive aspect marker 'cʌ-' disappears.(52) c-ɪbɪ

morphological structure, because of the marker 'cV-' and at the same time
it is very productive in forming the progressive, which is associated with
imperfective aspect.
Tima expresses the progressive aspect by means of adverbials such as
'kuhunʌŋ', 'now' in addition to the progressive aspect marker 'cV'. The
speakers use such adverbs in order to put more emphasis on the
progression of an action as in (54).

Progressive past always refer to past habits. Tima expresses the
progressive past by using the same form that is used with progressive
aspect in the present, but in order to differentiate between the two forms a
periphrastic adverb 'wadɔŋ', 'in the past', for example, is used with the
progressive past. Compare example (55) which indicates progressive past
with example (56), which expresses a normal way of referring to

certainty marker 'kV-' only without any use of the future marker 'dV-'.
This usually occurs as an answer to a question (see the question in (122a)

proclitic 'kV-' and uncertainty form with the proclitic aspect marker 'cʌ-'
plus the future tense maker 'dV-' (for examples see 4.4.1.1). The former is
considered as progressive future. Therefore, there is a complementary
distribution between the certainty as a mood marker and the aspect
marker 'cʌ-' (progressive and habitual markers). That is, they never occur
together in one sentence. This justifies their occurrence in one slot in
Table 4.1 which are represented by ASP and M (see 4.2).
The following section will be on the derivational processes on Tima
verbs. The section consists of several parts concerning the operation of
decreasing and increasing valency.","[230, 231, 232]"
"4.1.3 Reduplicated verbs
Tima has another class of verbs involving reduplicated verb roots. This
class of verbs displays a category of full reduplicated verbs, where no
traces of partially reduplicated verbs are found in the data unless the
reduplication has a morphological function, indicating pluractionality (see
4.5.1.2). The reduplicated verbs here do not convey any grammatical
function. The examples of reduplicated verbs are shown below.
(1)
-munmun-'smile'-dumdum-'detain'-muɽ(u)muɽ-'asking God'-bʊlbʊl-'roll'4.1.4 Compound verbs
In addition to the canonical shape of verb roots which is used in order to
classify verbs, Tima has a class of verbs which is classified according to140their structural elements or components. That is, compound verbs are
formed by combining the verb as a head of the verb phrase (VP) plus a
noun which syntactically functions as object. The verbs in this class can
not stand by themselves, i.e. without such combinations with nominal
complements. The examples are:
(2)
a) ʊ-hɔɔʌɽuuɽukASP.3plhitshoutings'they shouted (lit. they hit the shouting)' (the story of horse quarrel)b) y-ʌhunen
NC.pl-womant̪ɪh-ɪø-ɪdɪdɪpull out-TrNC.pl-yululate'the women produced the ululate (lit. the women pulled out the ululate)'
(the story of horse quarrel)4.1.5 Inflected verbs
Tima has a special class of verbs that are inflected for person. They have
an object semantically performing the role of recipient. By comparison,
the basic form of the verb (root) has its own meaning which differs when
it is associated with a pronoun. Consequently, the complex verb has a
new meaning. For examples:
(3)
Inflected verb
a) ayi-yaŋ 'visit (him/them)'The basic verb form
ay-ɪ
'go'b) kʊnɛ-tʌŋ 'help (him/them)'kʊnɛ'prevent'c) ahɪyʌŋahɪ'give''give him'1414.2 The verb as a word category
The term verb structure, sometimes referred to as 'verb group', indicates
that the verb consists of verb root plus different affixes (prefixes or
suffixes). The resulting form is referred to as 'verb stem'. The affixes
which appear on the verb are classified as either inflectional or
derivational morphemes. Their order with regard to the root differs from
one language to another. For instance, Swahili verb-structure consists of
up to ten different affixes (Lindfors, 2003). Tima verb structure is more
complicated than the Swahili verb-structure. The Tima verb form consists
of at least 12 elements. Table (4.1) illustrates the order of the different
affixes and clitical elements. Following the table is a description of the
different slots (along with examples). Parentheses in this table indicate
that the item is not obligatory.","[161, 162, 163]"
"2.2.1.4 Compounding
Compounding is another morphological process shared in the formation
of word structure. Spencer (1991: 309) defined compounding as
""prototypically the concatenation of words to form other words"". A
compound form consists of two/more members of (potentially) open
lexical class. For instance, English allows several types of combinations
of different word-classes (N+N, A+N, V+N, N+V, N+A, A+A, etc.).
Usually, the two items that are brought together in a compound also24appear as independent words in a language on the one hand (e.g.
blackboard). On the other hand, one of the compound elements can
appear as an independent word (e.g. strawberry). Sometimes, both
members of compound are elements that only occur together (e.g.
mushroom) (Fabb, 1998).
According to the structure of compounding, there are various types of
compounding that are widespread across languages. The commonest
types of compounding are: endocentric, exocentric, and appositional/coordinate compounds (for definition see 5.2).
There is a difficulty encountered in various languages when trying to
distinguish between compounds and phrases (especially NP). Fabb (1998)
mentioned that compounds resemble phrasal combination in some ways 6 .
To avoid such resemblance between the two categories a number of
criteria are stated in order to distinguish between them. Firstly, the
phonological criteria sometimes help in that. The suprasegmental
processes, for instance the stress patterns, which are restricted to the
compounds, may differ from those restricted to the phrases (e.g. English,
'the white house').
Secondly, some languages may mark the compounds morphologically.
That is, a morpheme may be inserted between the two words, found only
in compounds, and it considered as a special empty suffix semantically
(e.g. the morpheme 's' in German, 'Volk-s-wagen', 'lit. people's car').","[45, 46]"
"2.4.1.1 Pronominal markers
In African languages, the subject and object are normally expressed on
the verb by bound morphemes. The term 'pronominal markers' is used to
refer to subject/object distinctions. They are considered as an inherent
inflectional category of verb. By definition, the pronominal markers refer
to an entity of a noun phrase which is found elsewhere in the sentence
and they usually distinguish between subject/object from a syntactic point
of view.
According to Creissels et al. (2008), there are three subtypes of
pronominal markers which are considered as cliticization of free
pronouns. Type 1 pronominal markers are in complementary distribution
with the corresponding noun phrase. Type 2 pronominal markers are
obligatory even when the corresponding noun phrase is present in the
subject/object function. Type 3 pronominal markers are also obligatory,
but they can not appear without the corresponding noun phrases.
The pronominal markers in Tima fall under the second type, where the
existence of them is obligatory irrespective of the representation of the
corresponding noun phrases in the sentence. They are presented by both
proclitic markers fused with Tense/Aspect markers and by enclitics which
are attached to the verb at the same time in the case of subject (see 4.3.2).
There is frequently a problem in analyzing these pronominal markers in
African languages. They are analyzed as independent words, because
36they have forms which differ from those of independent pronouns in a
language. Now the pronominal markers have been identified correctly,
they frequently have turned out (in the majority of African languages) to
be bound subject and object markers.","[57, 58]"
"2.2.1.2 Stem modifications
A stem modification is another process which affects word structure; it
involves non-concatenation morphology 5 . Spencer (1991) stated that
stem modifications in many languages indicate grammatical categories by
a shift of vowel, consonant, stress and tone. English is an example where
the vowel alternation device marks tense in verbs such as 'drink/drank/
5The process of non-concatenative morphology indicates that the complex derived word form can not
be easily segmented into different morphemes; instead the morphological process can be described in
process terms (Haspelmath, 2002).",[41]

With regard to functions of adjectives in languages, Sasse (1993: 661)
mentioned that the prototypical function of adjectives is to attribute
properties. This claim is supported by a large number of languages whose
adjectives occur only as modifiers of nouns, and do not occur as predicate
at all. But in other languages adjectives may function as predicates only,
as the case in the adjectives of Dholuo (Okoth-Okombo, 1997).
The Tima adjectives play double functions, i.e. they function as
attributives and as predicates. This indicates that the adjectives occur in
an intermediate status between nouns and verbs. This is true for Tima
adjectives when they function as attributive; they are formed by taking
the proclitic marker 'kV-' in the singular form and the proclitic marker 'i-'
in the case of plural and this resembles the general way of marking nouns
in Tima. The proclitics 'kV-' and 'i-' markers function as relativizer. The105adjectives in attributive function are shown in the first column in example
(77) below. The vowel of the relativizer proclitic 'kV-' harmonizes with
the verb root, see below (Bashir forthcoming).
On the other hand, when the adjectives function as predicates, they are
formed by taking the proclitic 'a-' in the singular and 'i-' in the plural (see
the examples in (78) below), these markers are the same as a stative
marker 'a-' which appears with stative verbs (see 4.4.2.4 ). The adjectives
in predicate function are shown in the second column in example (77).
(77)
Adj. in attributive function

old (big)'
old (big)'a-kwɔlɔŋ 'the man isThus, one can write two formulas according to the adjective functions as
follows:
a) Adj. in attributive function: REL (kV-/i-) + Adj.R
b) Adj. in predicate function: STAT + Adj.R
In both cases, the adjectives show a procliticaization/prefixation process
in order to indicate whether the adjective is singular or plural. The two106vowel prefixes are: /a-/ʌ-/for singular and /ɪ-/i-/for plural adjectives
(these two prefixes are also used with cardinal numbers (see 3.2.2). The
number marking of adjectives in Tima is shown in example (78) below in
their predicate function.

in number between the adjective and the head noun in a noun phrase. See
example (79) below.
(79)
a) ku-rtu

sg.big'(a) big house'b) i-rtu
pl.houseɪ-kwɔlɔŋ
pl.big'(the) big houses107c) * i-rtu
pl.housea-kɔlɔŋ
sg.big'(the) big houses'Example (79c) above is considered as an ungrammatical NP because the
adjective which is singular does not agree with a noun in number.
Therefore, both the noun and the adjective should either be singular or
plural in ordered to yield a well formed and grammatical NP.
The examples in (79) show that the adjectives as attributive modifiers
follow the noun they modify. Thus, a rule of an NP that constitutes an
adjective as a modifier is:
NP→ N + Adj (Modifier)Nouns can be derived from adjectives by using the prefix /b(v)-/. For
more details and examples see abstract nouns in (5.1.3).
All the examples of adjectives mentioned above show that if adjectives
are used as modifiers i.e. in their attributive functions or in predicate
position, they can be themselves modified by an intensifier. In such case,
the adjectives undergo an internal change only. That is, there is a sort of
gemination of the first or second root consonants in order to show the
degree of intensification. The first consonant gemination takes place
when the adjective roots consist of one syllable (CVC). The second
consonant is germinated when the adjectives consist of more than one
syllable (Bashir forthcoming). The adjectival root will be given only in
example (80).","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129]"
"763.1.4 The 'd-' noun-class prefixIt is found that the noun-class prefix 'd-' in Tima refers to the class of
languages. Tima native speakers refer to their language as 'd-umurik'. It
is also associated with languages of neighboring ethnic groups such as:

a) d-ɘmaadaŋ'Katla language'b) d-umuɽuk'Tulishi language'c) d-uuba'Nyimang language'd) d-ɛɛrkɪyʊ'Arabic language'It has been found in the data that the 'd-' class is not associated only with
languages as those in example (37); it also replaces the singular nounclass prefix 'kV-' when the noun refers to speech or language in general,
see example (38) below (the example is taken from the story of myth,
Adllan Misiria).
(38)

Locative nouns typically express the idea of location of an entity, i.e. they
usually specify the location. In many languages, locative markers are
considered as a case-marking system on nouns and /or noun phrases.
Moreover, locative markers are treated as inflectional markers on nouns
(Bubenik, 1999). Nouns in Tima can take certain markers to specify a
location. These locative nouns are marked by different proclitics; the
latter are syntactically prepositions. But they are considered as
phonologically bound morphemes preceding nouns, because their exact
shape depends on the phonological properties of the following noun.
There are two locative markersː the prefix 'lV-' and the proclitic 'i-'.","[97, 98, 99]"
