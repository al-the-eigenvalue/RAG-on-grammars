For the sake of completeness, I introduce an additional sentence-focus construction
in KK. These sentences include an adverb or a locative at the beginning. Importantly,
here the stress is on the adverbial element, and =pura appears on the last element of the
clause: [ADV S V(O)=pura]. In contrast to the narrow-focus constructions, the
pura-marked element is not only unstressed but almost always a short form pronoun.

c. Speaker A: cuando yayakati=tsui
inu=muna ya=pura
when go.up.river=ABL 3PL.F=steal 3SG.F=FOC
„When from up there they steal it‟The sentences in (28) come from the conversation about illegal fishing. In (28b)
Speaker B basically repeats the proposition of Speaker A. The main propositional
content has been already mentioned, but with (28b) Speaker B specifies the location of
the event. The stressed pieces in (28b) and (28c) have opposite meaning —„down there‟
and „up there‟— and also the verbs are quasi-antonyms — „protect‟ and „steal‟.
Nevertheless, the overall meaning of (28c) only reaffirms what has been said by
Speaker B in (28b). Clearly, in these examples an interpretation of the pura-marked
pronoun as being under focus is not viable. With =pura at the end of the sentence the705speaker cues the hearer to construe the whole sentence as being in focus rather than the
stressed adverbial element or the pura-marked pronoun only.
11.2.4.2.=pura and negationAdditional cases of sentence focus are found in negative constructions. It is well
known that there are close connections between Focus and Negation (Givón 2001).
From a functional perspective, this is not a coincidence: negation typically applies to
some piece of information concerning which there is some difference between the
knowledge of the speaker and that of the addressee. As Givón points out, in negative
assertions, the speaker is not communicating new information to the hearer; rather he is
correcting the hearer‟s misguided beliefs (Givón 2001:372). The morpheme =pura
interacts with negation not only to correct the hearer‟s beliefs, but also to express
correction of the speaker‟s own former beliefs.
Examples (29a-c) come from a narrative in which the speaker is talking about
her first trip by airplane. Based on her knowledge of planes making noise at landing and
taking off, she was expecting the same noise from inside the airplane. In (29b), notice
the assertion of the false value of the proposition: FALSE <planes make noise while
flying>

The morpheme =pura sporadically attaches to the negative particle tɨma. As
mentioned earlier, the language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. In natural
discourse, the distribution of these particles is skewed; ni occurs rarely and seems
related to particular idiolects. While some speakers use both, some others avoid ni
altogether. In the first case, there is a tendency to use tɨma to negate the whole clause, or
to negate the verb phrase. In contrast, ni is used to negate single units, mostly arguments
and sometimes the predicate. A general characterization of tɨma is that its scope covers
the (biggest) constituent that immediately follows it, including [SVO], [VO], and some
adverbs. The examples below show this, where the negated portion is in bold.

all the instances where the negative particle is marked by =pura, it is the constituent in
first position within the clause, hence focusing on the negation of the whole predication.

c. ay

NEG=FOC-already 3SG.M=hear
„So, he cannot hear anymore/he is no longer able to hear‟
In all these examples the morpheme tɨma is negating the whole sentence. Thecontexts for the sentences in (31a) were set up by the speaker in the preceding
discourse. In rainy season, communities that are close to the rivers are expected to get
destroyed and literally disappear. In (31a) the speaker is reporting that because they
moved the community to another place, this is no longer true. In the same text, the
speaker said that people used to walk through the forest to get to the community, and
this was a difficult journey. In contrast, now they have a path (31b). The context for
(31c) is this: the speaker says that once his friend started having ear-aches. With time he12Below is an example where =pura attaches to ni. The speaker is reporting that nowadays they have all
kinds of fish, except for „paiche‟, the most valued fish in the Amazon. The scope of negation is „paiche‟,
because if the negation were to involve the existential predication, the form temente „there-is-not‟ would
have been used.

truth value is reversed and the speaker is focusing on the truth value „false.‟
(31‟) a. FALSE <it gets destroyed>
b. FALSE <we go through the forest>
c. FALSE <he can hear>
As Givon (2001) points out, with negative constructions the speaker is somehow
correcting the hearer‟s misguided beliefs. In that sense, they could be thought of as
contrastive. However, they are not contrastive in the sense of Watters (1979). Recall
that Watters proposes counter-assertive polar focus for “the speaker‟s reply
contradicting the hearer‟s assertion.” None of the examples with =pura on the negative
particle is the hearer‟s reply to what the speaker has previously asserted. Thus, the
construction [NEG=pura [clause]] is better categorized as Watter‟s polar focus. In the
database, there are no instances of contradicting replies, so at this point we do not know
whether any specific construction would be associated with this function.
11.2.5. Summary and discussion
The morpheme =pura assumes two main pragmatic functions: narrow-focus
operator, and sentence-focus spacer. From Table 11.2 (pg. 721), we can see that, in the
parameter of scope, when =pura assumes a narrow-focus function, it generally attaches
to stressed NPs in either object argument function or oblique function, but quite rarely
in subject function. A less robust pattern shows =pura marking arguments within a
subordinate clause.","[733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738]"
"5289.2.2. Declarative sentences: functions
Declarative sentences are primarily employed to assert, make claims and
statements about the world, etc. However, with the appropriate context and prosody,
declarative constructions can also convey interrogation and requests.
Assertions are statements about what is observable in the world. These
statements are capable of being witnessed and the witnesses can classify them as true or
false. Examples of assertions are given in (87).

9.3. Negative sentences
From a functional perspective, negative sentences are a subtype of declarative
sentences. They are employed primarily to make negative assertions. However, in
contrast to positive declarative sentences, negation typically applies to some piece of
information concerning which there is some difference between the pragmatic
information of the speaker and that of the addressee.
The language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. In natural discourse, the
distribution of these particles is skewed. In the database, there are about 276 instances
of tɨma, whereas ni appears only around 124 times. It could be, though, that ni is related
to particular idiolects and styles. For instance, while some speakers use both forms,
some others avoid ni altogether. On the other hand, we found one speaker that makes
exclusive use of ni. The syntactic distribution of the two negative morphemes is
described below.","[557, 558, 559]"
"5309.3.1. Constructions with tɨma
The morpheme tɨma is employed primarily to negate the whole clause, or the
verb phrase; however, it can also negate adverbs and noun phrases. This form has its
source in the Tupí-Guaraní negative morpheme *eɁɨm (Cabral 1995:148, Jensen
1998:546).
A general characterization of tɨma is that its scope covers the (biggest)
constituent that immediately follows it, including [SVO], [VO]. The examples below
show this, where the negated portion is in bold. Examples in (93) give all the attested
positions that the negative marker tɨma can take within the clause.

iriwa-ka=tsuri
tɨma
3SG.F
come.back-REI=PAS3 NEG
„He came back not good (sick)era
goodSV tɨma [ADV]In (93a), tɨma appears fronted, hence negating the whole clause. In (93b-c), it
precedes the verb phrase, so it negates the predicates „lack‟ and „eat salt‟, respectively.
In (93d) tɨma shows up at the beginning of the clause, but here the object is focalized in
first position. Consequently, the scope of tɨma is the object. In (93e) is quite similar to
(93a); tɨma negates the whole clause. The difference is that in (93e) there is an adverb
outside of the scope of negation. Finally, example (93f) demonstrates that the scope of
tɨma can be as small and specific as an adverb.
The fact that the scope of the negator tɨma is the following can be manipulated
by certain conjunctions, such as riay „also.‟ For instance, in (94), the scope of tɨma is
precisely the object pronoun ene „you‟ which appears following riay. In the discourse
context, a person is calling someone in particular, but other people answer his call. So in
previous utterances, he keeps saying: “I didn‟t call you‟. Thus, in (94) the act of calling
is not being negated, but only who is being called.

In asserting with negative constructions, the speaker is not communicating newinformation to the hearer as can be the case with positive declaratives; rather he is532correcting the hearer‟s misguided beliefs (Givón 2001:372). Across languages, there is
a connection between focus and negation, and. KK is no exception. The focus
morpheme =pura interacts with negation to correct the hearer‟s presuppositions.

„So, he cannot hear anymore/he is no longer able to hear‟
[Presupposition: he/people hear]
As seen in (95), the negative particle can carry the focus marker =pura. In all theinstances where the negative particle is marked by =pura, it occurs in first position
within the clause, hence negating the whole predication. For an in-depth discussion of
focus constructions, see Chapter XI.
9.3.2. Constructions with ni
Compare to tɨma, the productivity of ni is more limited. It could be hypothesized
that the source of this morpheme is Tupí-Guaraní *n/ni-…-i (Jensen:1998:545). As
indicated above, tɨma is twice as productive as ni. This fact has to do with the capability
of these forms in terms of their scope of negation. Unlike tɨma, which can negate
anything from clauses to adverbs, ni is used primarily to negate single units, generally
core arguments of the clause.

my corpus contains only one example in (100) where =pura attaches to the negative

fish, except for paiche, one of the most valued fish in the Amazon. The scope of
negation is paiche: has the negation involved the existential predicate, the form temende
„there-is-not‟ would have been used.

9.3.3. Interaction of tɨma and ni
Both tɨma and ni can occur within a single clause, as shown in (101). In those
cases, it is clear that the piece of information marked by ni is within the scope of
negation of tɨma. In (101b) ni negates „a letter‟, whereas tɨma negates the whole verb
phrase „know a letter.‟ Similarly, in (101c), while ni negates „person‟, tɨma negate „tell
anyone.‟

"Certainty =tinSpeakers use =tin to express certainty regarding the proposition expressed in a
given utterance. In elicitation, speakers told me =tin means si „yes‟, like the Spanish
conjunction to mark strong assertions. To illustrate this claim, one speaker provided me
the example in (25) that involves contrast. The context given for this example was this:
one guy and his mother have an accident and someone asks: have they died? The
answer to this question would be (25), where the first clause is a negative statement, and
the second a positive one. The speaker then translated the whole sentence into Spanish
as: la mamá no murió, él si „The mother doesn‟t die, he does‟.",[516]

When grammatical tense needs to be added to the juxtaposition constructions,
the tense marker is attached to the second noun phrase, which is the predicate.
Examples in (4) demonstrate the mechanism used for applying tense information. The
resulting structure is: [NP NP=T]. All the tense clitics work similarly in both equatives
(4a-b) and proper inclusion (5a-b) constructions.

him, example (5b) could be used.
However in future tense, some restrictions have been detected. In general,
attribute predicates are not frequent in the future. As discussed in §9.1.2.4, the
morpheme =a „FUT2‟ is generally less frequent than =utsu ‘FUT1‟; nominal predicates
seem to be one of the most restricted contexts for =a, as only =utsu is attested in
juxtaposed predicate nominals.

Note that example (7a) can receive two interpretations, „young girl‟ and „a gayman.‟
8.1.1.2. Negation and juxtaposition constructions
As introduced in §4.6.1, one of the main strategies of negation in KK is the use
of the independent particle tɨma. In verbal constructions, this particle usually goes in the427first position of the sentence, and in this way the whole predicate is negated. However,
when we want to change the scope of negation, this particle can be moved to some other
slots. The negative version of equative and proper inclusion predicate constructions is
formed simply by adding the particle tɨma between the two NPs. That is: [NP NEG NP].
In text, the negative particle has not been attested in first position .

„Maybe my daughter in law has transformed completely; she is not a woman‟
This pattern is also employed to negate constructions marked by tense. For
instance, to negate a past tense juxtaposition clause, the negative particle goes between
the two NPs and the tense marker attaches to the second NP. Example (9b) comes from
a story that talks about some kind of magical entity that long ago was just a spirit;
however at present, he shows up from time to time looking like a person and can get
you into trouble.

In a previous work, (Vallejos 2004), I described a pragmatically marked version
of the NP juxtaposition construction as left-dislocation. In this case, the fronted NP is
coreferential with an object pronoun. The structure of the construction is: [NPi, NP-Proi]
(10).
(10)a. joan
wayna=ay /=ura
joan
woman=3SG.F/3SG.M
„Joan is (a) woman‟ [Lit. Joan, woman she is] (ED)
b. jack napitsara=ay /=ura
Jack man=3SG.F/ 3SG.M
„Jack is man‟ [Lit. Jack, man he is] (ED)
According to typological studies, left dislocation constructions are supposed tohave a separate intonation contour for the dislocated NP and a resumptive pronoun
coreferential with the dislocated NP (Givon 2001:266). The elicited examples in (10)
include an anaphoric pronoun, but the whole expression seems to occur under a single
intonational contour. However, a pause can be placed after the first NP, Joan (10a), and
Jack (10b).
To negate this left-dislocation construction, similar to the cases described above,
the negative particle tɨma is placed in front of the predicate noun phrase; that is, right
after the dislocated NP. However, in these cases there is a clear pause between the
dislocated NP and the negative particle. In (11a-b) that pause is expressed by a comma.
(11)a. Joan, tɨma napitsara=ay
Joan NEG man=3F.OBJ
„Joan, she is not a man‟ (ED)429b. yukun wayna-kɨra, tɨma uyari awa=ay
DEM woman-DIM NEG again person=3F.OBJ
„That little woman, she is no longer a person‟ (she got transformed again)
In terms of their function, this type of sentence is used in more marked contexts
than the simple juxtaposition of two NPs. For examples, these constructions were used
when the speakers failed to identify the sex of the referents after hearing their names. In
those cases I explained the situation like this: “Joan is a woman, Jack is a man” and,
after this clarification, the speakers said the examples in (10).
Another case when such a construction was given is when the speakers were
asked for negative proper inclusion like this:
(12)a. tɨma
maninpiara=ay
NEG
hook=3SG.F
„It is not a hook‟ (ED)
b. tɨma maninpiara=ura,
ra
ɨwa=pura-nan
NEG
hook-3SG.M 3SG.M stick=FOC-only
„It is not a hook; it is only its stick‟ (ED)ura
3SG.MIt is interesting to notice that in the second part of example (12b) it is possible
for a pronoun to show up before the predicate nominal, „only a stick.‟ When it occurs,
note that the pronoun is not interpreted as the subject; instead it creates a genitive
relationship, so it is interpreted as the possessor of the predicate NP. Again, the subject
referent is expressed via the pronoun that follows the nominal. This time as a free form,
ura, rather that the clitic.
8.1.2. [NP NP(-)yara]
This construction links two noun phrases by means of the morpheme -yara
optionally attached to the second NP. In Chapter 7, -yara was characterized as a430derivational morpheme that generates verbs from nouns with the meaning „have‟ and
„make‟. Thus, strictly speaking, constructions in which -yara attaches to a noun, [NP
N-yara] would not be considered a non-verbal predicate per se, but an intransitive
verbal construction with the configuration [NP V] (see §7.2.4.4).
However, there are instances in which -yara appears optionally attached to a NP
rather than a noun that could not be accounted for by the verbalizer derivational
analysis. Those cases are analyzed here as non-verbal predicate constructions in which
-yara indicates that the second NP is a property — that of possessor — of the first NP.
Consider examples in (13).
(13)a. mijiriɨara-yaraMiguel
canoe-owner
„Miguel is the owner of a canoe‟
(Lit. Miguel is canoe-owner‟) (ED)
b. ikian
uka-yara=tsuriay

house-owner=PAS3
„This was the owner of the house‟
(Lit. This was the house-owner) (ED)
c. ajan wayna
mɨmɨra-yara

„This woman is a mother‟
(Lit. „This woman is son-owner; she has a child‟)
d. rutsa mɨmɨra-yara,
wepe-nan
Rosa son-owner
one-only
„Rosa‟s own child is only one‟ (Lit. Rosa is son-owner of one only) (ED)
First, in (13) -yara does not change the category of the noun. In terms of
grammar, no other verbal suffixes can added after -yara. In contrast, yara-derived verbs
can take the morphology associated with underived verbs, including the progressive, the431causative, the completive, and with less frequency the reiterative/reflexive (see
§7.2.4.4). In terms of meaning, NP-yara is not interpreted as „have N,‟ but as „the N‟s
owner.‟ For instance, in (13), uka-yara is not interpreted as „this has/makes house,‟ but
as „this is the house owner/owner of the house.‟ Thus, I argue that sentences (13)
illustrate non-verbal predicate constructions, where uka-yara is the predicate NP.
Further evidence that the sequence uka-yara in (13) is a noun phrase rather than
a derived verb is provided in (14). In the examples below, the NP-yara operates as the
subject NP of a typical verb, such as kumitsa „speak‟ (14a), and yawachima „arrive‟ in
(14b).
(14)a. raepe

kumitsa
then
house-owner talk
„Then, the house owner talks‟
b. raepe
ikian uka-yara
yawachima
then
this
house-owner arrive

Structures in (14) suggest a compound like behavior of -yara that appear to beremnants of its source, the Tupinamba form *jár-a „owner‟ (Jensen 1998:507) (see
7.2.4.4).
8.1.2.1. Tense in constructions with -yara
When we want to add tense information to this construction, tense clitics are
added after (-)yara. Note in (15a-b) that (-)yara appears unbounded from the preceding
noun, but attached to the tense clitic

8.1.2.2. Negation in constructions with -yara
The negative version of possessive constructions with -yara is presented in (16).
The particle tɨma usually occurs between the possessor and the possessed. If the
negative predication is in focus, the possessor subject is no longer in first position, but
rather the predicate. But the particle tɨma still precedes the possessed element (16b).

If in a community there were a house that did not have an individual owner (i.e.one that is used for assemblies), sentence (16c) would be used. It refers to the fact that
the community has the ownership of the house. This example is interesting because the
two types of yara co-occur: one as a noun and the other as the marker possessed status.","[454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"

As a general observation, in the corpus stative verbs occur more frequently innominalized constructions than in verbal constructions. In Vallejos (2004) this
phenomenon was described as resembling relative constructions. In (21a-d), the subject
noun phrase comes in first position followed by the nominalized stative verb.

be.bland=NZR=FOC
„The food is not good; it‟s sweet only; it doesn‟t have salt; it‟s bland‟
I would like to call some attention to the last example (21d). The first portion,
„the food is not good‟ includes the stative verb era „be good‟ which appears in a verbal
clause; however, „it is sweet‟ and „it is bland‟ are expressed via nominalized436constructions. Note also that the word „salt‟ is a noun, so it needs the verbalizer -yara
„have‟ before it can take -n to express that „the food has salt,‟ That is: *tewe-n „salty‟ is
ungrammatical.
With less frequency, the reverse order is also possible. That is, the nominalized
stative verb comes in first position followed by the NP.

Negative construction with nominalized stative verbs are formed by symply
placing the negative particle tɨma before the nominalized stative verb. That is: [NP tɨma
Vsta-n] (23a-c).
(23)a. raepe

the predicate noun phrase, [NP Vsta-n=TNS] (24).

There is a construction to indicate attribution that commonly receive future
interpretation. The postposition of purpose =ra is attached to the second noun phrase
(25). This construction is very productive and has a slightly specialized reading; it
generally bears a sense of transformation, or „becoming.‟ If a tense clitic is not present,
it has future reading; however, tense can be made explicit by attaching one of the clitics
to the predicate NP. Note the future marker =utsu (25b) and the past =tsuri(ay) in (25c).

postpositional phrase (26). Note that tɨma cannot be sentence initial in (26), which is
additional evidence that the morpheme =ra is not the denominal verbalizer. In verbal
predicate constructions, tɨma in sentence initial position is the privileged pattern.

I would like to mention that there is a homophonous verbalizer suffix -ra,described in §7.2, which could be confused with the purposive postposition. The
examples below show that the verbalizer generates denominal verbs out of nouns, with
a completely different syntactic structure. Both examples exhibit SV structure; in (27a),
the ra-derived verb is the main predicate of the clause; in (27b) the ra-derived verb is
within a relative clause that is operating as the modifier of the subject „woman.‟

The equative function can also be expressed by encliticizing a third person
subject pronoun to the predicate. This construction consistently conveys identification439functions. The person marker has the object form but it is the notional subject, while the
NP operates as the predicate (28a-c).

„She is not your sister in law‟
c. epe kuniada=ura
2PL sister.in.law=3M.OBJ
„She is your sister in law‟
In (28a), the predicate NP is „my son‟ and the subject is the pronoun ura „he‟.
Example (28b) shows how this construction is negated. In this particular utterance, the
negative particle ni is placed in front of the predicate NP, „your sister in law.‟ Example
(28c), which was elicited based on (28b), shows the affirmative counterpart.
The examples in (29) involve interrogative words. They also illustrate the
employment of modal particles within this construction. In (29a), the second position
clitic that conveys uncertainty, =taka, attaches to the predicate NP, and then the
pronominal subject enclitic follows. In (29b), the modal era occurs at the end of the
construction, as it does for verbal predicates.

the equative, proper inclusion and attributive functions. We now turn to constructions
that express a new function, the existential.

"1704.6.1. Negative particles
The language has two negative particles: tɨma and ni. While the first is used to
negate the whole clause or to negate the predicate, the later is mostly used to negate
specific arguments. In addition, the use of tɨma and ni seems to be associated with
particular idiolects and styles. In Chapter IX it will be argued that the scope of tɨma is
the constituent that immediately follows it. Examples in (42) illustrate the different
positions in which tɨma can appear in the clause.

Below are examples with the negative particle ni=. In contrast to tɨma, ni is
used to negate single units, mostly arguments of the predicate. For instance, in (43a),
below, the scope of negation is „paiche‟, because if the negation would involve the
existential predication, the form temende „there-is-not‟ would have been used. In (43c),
while ni negates „person‟, tɨma negate „tell anyone.‟

An extensive discussion on negative constructions can be found in Chapter IX,§9.3.
4.6.2. Quotatives
KK has at its disposal two quotative particles, ay and na. As in the case of ni,
above, these particles can occasionally appear attached to the element that immediately
follows them. While the first particle serves to introduce a quote, the second particle
follows a quote. Or as one of the consultants puts it: “I use ay to make someone speak,
but I use na when I made someone speak already”. In spontaneous discourse, the
quotative generally appears in a construction that consists of a quote, the quotative
particle, a short form or clitic pronoun and a cognition-utterance verb —e.g., kumitsa
„say/speak‟, tsawiti „answer‟, piata „ask‟, ɨmɨntsarara „tell stories,‟ chirara „name‟,172ikuaka „think‟3—. For the quotative na, the construction could be summarized as:
[[quote] na PRO V].

3SG.F=DATNote in (44d) that a long form pronoun is not allowed in this construction.4
But not all instances of the quotative occur within the above construction. There are a
few examples, like the ones in (45), where na is the only element signaling quoted
speech.
3The KK people “locate” thoughts, feelings, etc. in their hearts. Thus, to be more precise, the predicate
„think‟ is expressed via a construction that involve the word for „heart‟ as shown below:
[ikua-ka PRO iya]
„to think, or to know in one‟s heart‟
know-REI PRO heart
4In elicitation, a long form pronoun is allowed if appears in first position (see below); however, such a
structure is not attested in texts.

The second quotative, ay, is sparse discourse. The construction could besummarized as: [ay PRO V [quote]], as shown in the following examples.

2SGNote, in (46a) that the speaker telling the narrative is a man (hence the form of
the pronoun, ra „3SG.M‟, outside the quote), but the quote itself is from a woman
(hence the form of the pronoun, ya „3SG.F‟, inside the quote).
An important point to notice is that the quotative na often appears without the
quote itself, and it can show up either at the beginning or the end of the clause. In those
cases, it has a modal interpretation conveying assurance and conviction which is often
translated into Spanish as así pues, de ésta manera “in this way/like this”. The examples
below show this function of na.

Thus, the particle na can operate at both sentence level and intersentential level.
This is further discussed in Chapter X, §10.5.3.
4.6.3. Intersentential particles
There are a few conjunctions which serve as connectors of sentences in
discourse. A prominent feature of this set is that they vary according to the speaker‟s
gender. They generally occur in first position within the sentence. These include (male
speech form precedes the female speech form) riay/yay „also‟, urian/iyan „but‟,
raepe/yaepe „then.‟5 Based on the latter, there are other forms such as
raepetsui/yaepetsui „after that‟, (raepe=tsui „there=ABL‟), raepenan/yaepenan „until
there‟ (raepe=nan „there=only‟). Below there are extracts from several narratives which
illustrate the use of the connectors in connected speech.

those cases, however, its scope is not the entire clause but only the piece of information
immediately before riay/yay.66There are a few instances in which riay/yay even in first position seems to have a limited scope:

4.6.4. Interjections
There are a few particles that can be categorized as interjections, these elements
add emotional involvement and produced vivid language. These include an acute uuu
used as a greeting before entering someone else's house; apu „well‟ which is used for
filled pauses; ayau —now extended to regional Spanish— is used to express pain; iyan
„wow‟ conveys surprise and/or fear. KK spontaneous discourse is also full of
ideophonic elements. For instance, blom, is used to emphasized a sudden-surprising
entrance into a place; chaj, for the sound the water makes when thrown away;
chak/chakak, for sounds that solid things make when fell down or when someone hits
them (i.e., to open a coconut); chiiin,7 for total silence; ɨɨsss expresses nervousness; plon
for pushing something away; poj/soj for sounds when cutting wood (for firewood, for
instance); pululilin when something submerges into the water; saj for opening/cutting7Probably this form has been gramaticalized into the verb chinta „be.silent‟177something soft (i.e., fish); sak for cutting quickly something hard (i.e., liana); tin-tin
sound of a small drum; tsɨrɨj when someone trips and falls down; wiii, sound made by a
boa.

that the simplification of the TG language spoken in the region was gradual rather than
a radical process with “the emerging contact language at once becoming the language of
the community.” (Thomason and Kaufman 1997:150). In fact, Cabral does point out
language contact and bilingualism centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans to that area
of the Amazon. For instance, she suggests that “the presence of lexical elements of
Arawakan (Maipurean) origin in Kokama/Omáwa may date from before the creation of
the missionary villages or reducciones, and even before the European presence in the
Upper Amazon area” (2007:370). However, arguing for the abrupt creole hypothesis,
Cabral posits that during the first centuries of colonization (15th and 16th century)
Kokama and Omawa were only slightly different from Tupinamba, and that by the end
of the Jesuit period (end of 17th century) they lost most of their TG genetic features
(1995:304).
As mentioned above, an alternative hypothesis could be that the simplification
of the TG language spoken in the region was a rather gradual process that started prior
to the establishment of missionary villages. Historical and linguistic evidence points in
that direction. Early chronicles (see Chapter I) described a regular trade network among
the groups in this area of the Amazon. As for structural evidence, in addition to the
conservation of so many grammatical morphemes and patterns (as seen in Table 12.1),
the loss of elaborated person systems is also associated with internal reanalysis of
subordinated constructions, which we know can happen during a gradual replacement of
main clause grammar by nonfinite verb forms with additional elements like auxiliaries757and clitics (cf. the English innovations of nonfinite verbs plus auxiliaries for all but two
main clause types, or the examples of Maksuhi and Kuikúro, Cariban languages that
have entirely replaced their finite verbal systems with reanalyzed nominalizations
(Gildea 1998). This could account for the fact that KK has retained many TG elements
while at the same time has evolved into a unique language with an elaborated grammar
that is not usually associated with creoles, and certainly less with abrupt creoles.
However, what languages (and families) contributed to the rest of the mix remains to be
determined.","[784, 785, 786, 787]"
"703An additional use of sentence-focus constructions is not to communicate the
propositional content of the clause but to make explicit that both the speaker and the
hearer have knowledge of the propositions, that they share a common ground. In
contrast to the examples discussed above, here the propositions are entirely
presupposed. Examples that fall in this category include hearer‟s repetitions to confirm
„he got the point‟, speaker‟s conclusive remarks, etc.

§11.1.2, for constructions in which the whole predication is in focus, Watters (1979)
proposes the category polar focus. He argues that in polar focus constructions, it is the
truth value TRUE or FALSE which the speaker asserts or counter-asserts concerning a
proposition. Based on the communicative context, it could be argued that the speaker
uses sentence focus constructions involving =pura to asserts the truth value of the
proposition.","[732, 733]"
"4458.2.1.2. Negation in existential constructions
There are two ways to make negative existential predicates. The first
construction utilizes the particle tɨma, which is placed in front of emete to negate the
whole construction. As a result we have the construction: [NEG emete NP] whose
propositional meaning is „X does not exist‟. This is presented in examples (36a, b).
Note that in (36c), introduced in (34c), the existential construction is embedded, so
emete occurs at the end of the construction, [NEG NP emete].
(36)a. tɨma emete

show.up NEG ship=PL.M
„This lake shows up the time there are no ships‟emete-puka
exist-whenThe sequence tɨma emete is often realized as temente [temende]. No clear
correlation has been observed between temende and variables such as colloquial and
fast speech. Speakers do not seem to have any intuitions about the distribution of tɨma
emete versus temente. In general, my consultants have no problem replacing one for the
other in any utterance.
(37)a. temente

„Nowadays it doesn‟t exist (anymore)‟
The second type of negative existential includes the particle ni, which is placed
right in front of the noun phrase whose non-existence is being predicated. The
existential emete comes at the end. The resulting construction is: [ni NP emete] whose
propositional meaning is: „No X exists.‟ That is, the scope of ni is the noun phrase
rather than the whole construction. The examples are given in (38). It should be noted
that no example where emete precedes the negated NP has been attested [*emete ni NP].

enterExample (38b) is from a story about someone who disappeared and it is
suspected that he might have been eaten by a tiger. In (38c), repeated from (33a), the
speaker is talking about a type of fish that it is now almost extinct. The embedded447clause in example (38d), repeated from (34b), asserts that „no person‟ was around at the
time the event expressed in the main predicate happened.
Finally, the examples in (39) exhibit the combination of negation and tense.
Only the first pattern of negation — the one that includes tɨma— has been attested in
combination with tense clitics within a single utterance. To express both negation and
tense, the negative particle comes in the first position followed by emete, and then
comes the noun phrase to which the tense clitic is attached. Schematically: [NEG emete
NP=TNS]

8.2.1.3. Modals in existential constructions
Modal clitics attach to the first element in the clause, whether this is emete, or
the negative particle in negative existential constructions. Examples are given in (40ad).
(40)a. emete=taka n=awarindi, tal-vez
rana
yankata=ura=uy
exist-UNC 2SG=cachasa maybe
3PL.M
put=3M.OBJ=PAS1
„Your cachasa might be there, maybe they have left it‟
b. temente

ikian ɨpatsu=kuara

„There was not a tree (before), how could this be in the lake (now)‟448c. tɨma=ray emete ɨkɨ
NEG-SPE exist chili
„There wouldn‟t be any chili‟
[Indirect request: „Maybe you have some chili‟]
d. temente=tsunka,
NEG.exist-MODni
ini
NEG 1PL.INyuwama
daughter.lawemete=uy ya
ku=kuara
exist=PAS1 3SG.F farm=INE
„It appears it was not, it was not our daughter in law which was at her farm‟
In (40a) the uncertainty marker =taka cliticizes to emete. In (40b), the
apprehensive marker =era appears attached to emete and the whole construction gets
interpreted as questioning the potentiality of the event, „how could this be the case?‟
Example (40c) gives a negative existential construction in which the speculative modal
=ray attached to the negative particle tɨma. The particle -tsunka, in (40d), has not been
introduced yet. This is a discourse level morpheme that expresses the speaker‟s surprise
when an unexpected or unusual situation happens; it is against his expectations and he
resists believing it. In Amazonian Spanish it is usually translated with the expression ya
vuelta, which bears counter-expectation, surprise, and disbelief. This resembles what
DeLancey (2002) calls mirativity. For a full description of modality markers, see §9.1.3.
Finally, both pieces of the existential construction can be questioned
independently: example (41a) questions the “thing” whose existence is under
discussion, and (41b) questions the predicate „exist‟.
(41)a. ay senior, mari-tipa emete ajan ku=kuara
oh lord,
thing-Q
exist DEM farm=INE
„Oh my lord, what is there in this farm?‟449b. emete=tipa na=pala=chasu
exist=Q
2SG=shovel=AFF
„Do you have a shovel?‟
(Lit. Does your shovel exist?‟)
8.2.2. Existential constructions with possessive interpretation
In KK, possession can be inferred from several constructions. That is, the
relationship of possession is not created by the construction itself. As shown in §8.2,
some existential constructions are interpreted as possessive predicates. In the following
subsections I discuss the existential constructions that speakers primarily associate with
possession when asked to provide examples with possessive relationships.
8.2.2.1. [emete [POSSESOR POSSESSED]NP]
In this construction, the noun phrase whose existence is under discussion
consists of both a possessor and possessed element: [emete [POSSESOR
POSSESSED]NP]. Recall from §5.9 that in KK a genitive relationship inside a NP is
expressed by word order. In constructions with emete, the possessor is interpreted as the
subject, and the possessed as the object. The examples in (42) give this pattern; the
possessor is in bold.
(42)a. emete
tsa
mɨmɨrakunia=nu
ay
ikua yauki-tara=nu
exist
1SG.F daugther=PL.F
3SG.F know make-REL.A=PL.F
„I have daughters who know how to make it‟ (fan)
(Lit. There are my daughters who know how to make it)
b. emete
y=irua
exist
SG.F=mate
„He has a partner‟
(Lit. His partner exists)450c. ikia=ka
emete ta
irua=chasu
here=LOC exist 1SG.M mate=AFF
„Here (in this village) I have my partner‟
(Lit. My partner is in this village)
d. emete=taka na
ɨkɨ
exist=UNC 2SG chili
„You might have chili‟
(Lit. Maybe there is your chili)
Examples in (43) include noun phrases with two layers of genitive relationships.
For instance, in (43a), tsa mena „my husband‟ is the possessor of „money,‟ and tsa „I‟ is
the possessor of „husband.‟ In (43b) we see a comparable situation: „pain‟
metaphorically belongs to „my head‟, but at the same time tsa „I‟ is the possessor of
„head.‟ The elements interpreted as the subject of the possessive verb in the translation
are in bold.
(43)a. temente[[tsa ] mena=pura ]kurikiNEG.exist 1SG.F husband=FOCmoney‘My husband doesn’t have money’(Lit. My husband’s money doesn’t exist)
c. emete
[ [tsa] yakɨ ] tsachi-n
exist
1SG.F head feel.pain-NZR
„I have headache‟ (Lit. There is my head‟s pain)
8.2.2.2. [LOC emete NP]
The second existential construction that gets interpreted as expressing
possessive information is one where location is explicitly expressed. This is the451so-called mihi est construction, in which the possessor is interpreted from a locative
where some entity is supposed to exist: [LOC emete NP], as in (44a-b).
(44)a. ta
yuwama=ka
emete era-n
kaitsuma
1SG.M
daughter.law=LOC exist be.good-NZR yucca.beer
„My daughter in law has good yucca beer‟
(Lit. There is good yucca beer at my daughter in law)
b. juria=ka emete aruts
Julia=LOC exist rice
„Julia has rice‟
(Lit. There is rice at Julia) (ED)
However, the possessive interpretation becomes available only when thelocation makes reference to an animate being who could be a potential possessor (44,
45a). Note that when a clause does not include a locative phrase (45b), or it does not
refers to an animate entity (45c), the possessive reading is not available.
(45)a. awɨrɨ
kuriki
emete na=ka
how.much money
exist 2SG=LOC
„How much money do you have?‟
(Lit. How much money is there on you?) (ED)
b. awɨrɨ
kuriki emete
how.much money exist
„How much money is there?‟ (ED)
c. ikia-ka
emete eyu-n,
this=LOC exist eat-NZR
„Here there is food, mom‟mama
mother8.2.2.3. [NPi, emete POSSESSORi POSSESSED]
The existential construction [emete POSSESOR POSSESED] can be further
modified to highlight a pragmatically marked possessor. In this case, a left-dislocated
noun phrase is added to the front of the construction which is coreferent with the452POSSESSOR. Interestingly, this is one of the first patterns speakers provide when asked
to translate Spanish possessive constructions; in my text corpus, however, this pattern is
rather rare.
The examples in (46) are from texts, the one in (47) was elicited. In the
examples (46a-b) and (47a), note that the predicate phrase includes a possessor pronoun
which is coreferent with the noun phrase which precedes emete.
(46)(47)a. ikia chura-n=kɨrai
emete rai
this be.small-NZR=DIM exist 3SG.M

3SG.M.L exist 3SG.M
lemon=DIM
„He has his lemon in his packet‟
(Lit. „Hei, hisi lemon exists in his packet‟)r=atura=kuara
3SG.M=packet=INEa. juriai
temente
rai
yawiri
Julia
NEG.exist
3SG.M
yucca
„Julia does not have yucca‟
(Lit. „Julia, her yucca does not exist‟) (ED)
In the left-dislocated existential construction, a pause can be optionally addedafter the first NP. My consultants provided also some clues that point towards sentences
which are not about the possessive relationship, but about the entities being portrayed as
possessors. For instance, (48a) would be describing Julia in terms of what she
possesses.
(48)a. juriai […] temente
rai
yawiri
Julia
NEG.exist
3SG.M
yucca
„Julia does not have yucca‟
(Lit., As for Julia, her yucca doesn‟t exist) (ED)453b. urii […]
emete rai
rinupi=kɨra r=atura=kuara
3SG.M.L exist 3SG.M
lemon=DIM 3SG.M=packet=INE
„He has his lemon in his packet‟
(As for him, there is his lemon in his pocket) (ED)
In sum, I would argue that, although the left-dislocated existential construction
illustrated in (46) to (48) is interpreted as possessive, its primary function is less to
express a possessive relationship and more to predicate some facts about a
pragmatically marked entity within the discourse context.
8.2.2.4. [NP emete NP-yara]
This patter was found only in elicitation. It includes both emete and -yara. Here,
-yara functions as specifier of the noun it is attached to and it is interpreted as
„own/owner‟.
(49)a. mijiri
emete
uka-yara
Miguel

house-own
„Miguel has his own house‟
(Lit. Migueli, there is a house-owneri)
b. tsa
mena
emete
wapuru-yara
1SG.F
husband
exist
ship-own
„My husband has his own ship‟
(Lit. My husbandi, there is a ship-owneri‟)
If one wants to add tense to this construction, the tense clitics go after the NPmarked by -yara. This is further evidence that -yara is part of the predicate NP.
(50)a. mijiri
emete uka-yara=tsuriay
Miguel

„Miguel had his own house‟
(Lit. Miguel, there was a house-owner‟)

„My husband had his own ship‟ (Lit. My husband, there was a ship-owner‟)454Although this pattern, [NP emete NP-yara], was not found in my corpus, it was
confirmed by two other speakers. They have no problem understanding it, even though
they do not produce it spontaneously.

"Summary
The purpose of this chapter was to provide an overview of the different units KKexhibits, as well as to define the terminology used to refer to those units. The
morphological units KK displays include roots, stems, suffixes, clitics, and free
particles. They are summarized in Table 4.4, together with their host, if relevant, and
their canonical function(s).

are the most productive group. Crucial grammatical categories such as number, tense,
modality, interrogation and focus are conveyed by clitics. The language has about
twelve suffixes, only about four of which could be said show inflectional-like behavior.
However, none of them is obligatory in finite clauses. KK has also an important number
of free particles to indicate negation, quotations, sentential and intersentential
relationships, among others.
Now that the central categories and the main features of the language have been
established, we can continue with a detailed examination of each of them. In the next
chapter we focus on nouns.",[209]

As described in Chapter 7, in KK adjectival meanings are expressed by stative
verbs. Also called descriptive words, these verbs refer to notions such as human
propensities (aytse „be sick,‟ ɨra „be dishonest,‟ uti „be embarrased,‟ etc. ), colors (i.e.,
pɨtani „be reddish,‟ ɨkɨra „be greenish,‟ tini „be clear, white,‟ etc. ), dimensions (i.e.,
misha „be small,‟ nua/tua „be big‟), physical characteristics (i.e., ɨpɨ „be soft‟, yapua „be
round‟), and flavors (i.e., tse „be sweet,‟ irawa „be bitter‟). For a complete list of the
attested stative verbs and the constructions in which they occur, see §7.4.","[462, 463]"

Tsaniuri-constructions, then, are the weakest constructions in terms of getting
the addressee to act. This is especially evident if we compare them with negative
commands, as described next.
9.5.6. Prohibition or negative imperatives: ina
Prohibitives, or negative imperatives, are indicated by the prohibitive form ina
„PROH‟. The prohibitive marker also belongs to the small set of morphemes that break
the stress pattern of the language; that is, it is stressed in the last vowel, iná. With
respect to the etymology of the form ina, it has been reconstructed as the free response
negative morpheme: *ani (Jensen 1998:549). In some Tupi-Guaraní languages is used
as a strong negative imperative.","[589, 590]"
"481.6.2. Construction grammar
According to Constructionist approaches, constructions are “learned pairings of
form with semantic or discourse function, including morphemes or words, idioms,
partially lexically filled, and general phrasal patterns.” (Goldberg 2006:5). That is,
constructions are represented as symbolic units in their own right, just as lexical items
such as verbs are. It follows that, within this view, lexicon and grammar are not distinct
components, but form a continuum of constructions. Since evidence for categorization
is also found beyond language, contrary to the nativist view, construction grammar
posits that children learn constructions from the input; that is, they make generalizations
from instances.
Further, constructions form an interrelated network. For instance, simple clause
constructions reflect scenes basic to human experience, “such as that of someone
causing something to move or change state, someone experiencing something,
something moving, and so on” (Goldberg 1995:5). Goldberg (1995) emphasizes that a
linguistic pattern must be recognized as a construction as long as some aspect of its
form, meaning, or function is not predictable from its component parts or from other
constructions that exist in a given language. She adds, however, that patterns are stored
even if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with sufficient frequency. Given
the following sentences:
(3)a. Joe bought a book
b. Joe bought Tom a book
c. Joe gave Tom a bookTransitive construction
Ditransitive construction
Ditransitive construction49While (3a) entails getting an item, (3b) entails getting an item plus intended
transfer of it. According to non-constructionist approaches, the form and general
interpretation of basic sentence patterns of a language are determined by semantic
and/or syntactic information specified by the main verb. Thus, buy in (3b) does not
mean the same thing as buy in (3a), and so there must be a rule deriving buy in (3b)
from buy in (3a), which allows it to be used with the appropriate meaning in the
construction in (3b).
On the contrary, within the constructionist approach the meaning of (3a) and
(3b) are determined by the constructions themselves. The additional component of
meaning in (3b) is analyzed not as a part of the lexical content of the verb, but as a part
of the meaning of the Ditransitive construction. That is, in English, the Ditransitive
construction is an independently represented syntactic unit. As such, it possesses its
own semantics —<X CAUSES Y to RECEIVE Z>, as well as its own form —[SUB V
OBJ1 OBJ2]. However, note that, although (3b) and (3c) are both Ditransitive
constructions, the contribution of the construction is slightly different for buy and for
give. While (3c) entails actual transfer of possession, (3b) only implies transfer of
possession. Goldberg (1995:31) resolves this problem by proposing that constructions
can be polysemous. That is, a single construction can have two meanings that are
semantically related. Typically, one meaning is a historical extension of the other
meaning.
Within the constructional view, constructions are not derived from another
construction, but can involve a combination of several others, or inherit features from50others. For instance, What did Joe buy? involves the ditransitive construction, the
question construction, the Subject-Auxiliary inversion construction, etc. (Goldberg
2006:10). Importantly, to account for speakers‟ full knowledge of language, a usagebased model is required. Construction grammar aims to account not only for what has
been called the “core” grammar, but also for those apparently idiosyncratic patterns that
other theories have demoted to the periphery. As mentioned above, constructionists do
not endorse the autonomous view of syntax. Reference to SUBJ, OBJ, V, etc. appeal to
a relevant level of description; or, as Croft (2001) puts it, they are “metageneralizations
over construction-specific categories.”
1.6.3. Grammatical relations: an overview
Although most syntactic descriptions have assumed that, in addition to semantic
and pragmatic roles, there are also purely syntactic grammatical relations, we can find
two different ways of understanding them: i) as syntactic primitives; and, ii) as derived
notions. However, what are they derive from is a second point of divergence.
For the theory of Relational Grammar, grammatical relations are theoretical
primitives (Perlmutter 1978, 1980, 1982). Accordingly, Relational Grammar makes the
following universal assumption about the nature of clause structure: “A clause consists
of a network of grammatical relations. Among these relations are „subject of‟, „direct
object of‟, and „indirect object of‟” (Perlmutter & Postal 1986:9), which are named as 1,
2, and 3, respectively. Within this approach, a formal representation of Naomi gave that
book to me, would be (Perlmutter & Postal 1986:12, ex. 22):5155
P c11 c12 c13 c1gaveNaomithat bookmeFollowing this approach, any given language must display grammatical
relations. Further, any language must have clauses that contain one, two, and three
grammatical relations. However, empirical evidence shows that grammatical relations
or at least not all three of them, do not play a central role in every language.
A second way of understanding grammatical relations is as derived notions. For
early Transformational theory (Chomsky 1965), grammatical relations derive from
syntactic phrase structure. As such, subject and object have configurational definitions.
While subject is the NP immediately dominated by S (later called the external
argument), object was the NP immediately dominated by VP (later called the internal
argument). Within this tradition, there was neither a definition nor structural notion of
indirect object. In the figure below, from ([Aspects 1965] Van Valin 2002:244), Kim is
the subject, and the book is the object.

have a VP, and the verb and the object must be adjacent. Neither is transparently true
for free word order languages.
A third major conception, the Functional-Typological perspective, claims that
grammatical relations derive from the interaction and grammaticalization of semantic or
pragmatic relations. For Functional Grammar, different choices for subject and object
represent different perspectives or vantage points (Dik 1989). In Cognitive Grammar
(Langacker 1990), subject and object reflect a more general trajector/landmark
asymmetry, which is a linguistic instantiation of the even more general psychological
contrast between figure and ground. Other positions functionally associate subject with
mental starting point (DeLancey 1981, Chafe 1994, Mithun 1999), and subject with
attention (Tomlin 1995, 1997). For Givón (1984, 1995, 2001), subject and object are
grammaticalized pragmatic roles. Givón claims that subject is the “primary topic,”
object is the “secondary topic.” In Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan & Kanerva
1989), the assignment of grammatical relations is based on Lexical Mapping Theory.
Subject and object are constituted by two primitive semantic features (±r: restricted in
terms of semantic roles; ±o: able to complement transitive predicators but not
intransitive predicators). What these approaches have in common is that the assignment
of subject and object is based upon a hierarchy of semantic roles. Among the proposed
hierarchies are Dik‟s (1989) Semantic Function Hierarchy, Givón‟s (1984) Topic
Accession Hierarchy, and Bresnan & Kanerva‟s (1989) Thematic Role Hierarchy. Such
hierarchies are interpreted as determining preferred accessibility to grammatical53relations. For instance, in the Topic Accession Hierarchy (Givón 1984:139), given in
(4), if there is an agent, then the agent is the subject, if not, then dative/benefactive is
the subject, and so on.
(4) Agent >Dative/Benefactive>Patient>Locative >Instrument/Associative>Manner adverbs
One theoretical question, however, remains controversial: are grammatical
relations universal? Some functionalists such as Dixon (1994) and Givón (1997) assume
subject as a universal category, whereas Dryer (1997) and Mithun & Chafe (1999) take
a more skeptical position. DeLancey notes that, “Givon claims that there is a universal
function, while Dryer denies that there is a universal structural category of subject; both
could quite possibly be correct” (2003b:152)
I assume that grammatical relations are neither primitive nor derived from
syntactic phrase structure. Functional-typological theories insist that evidence for
grammatical relations must be based upon language-particular morphosyntactic
properties (Queixalós 1998, 2010). Comrie (1991) points out that “in order to say that a
given grammatical relation exists in a given language this claim must be justified both
language-internally and cross-linguistically”. Based on Keenan‟s (1976) work on the
properties of subjects, the formal features associated with grammatical relations are
divided into two main types: i) coding properties (word order, verb agreement, and case
marking), and ii) behavior & control properties (which define the role of the NP in
given grammatical constructions). Behavior and control properties, as syntactic
phenomena, are sometimes considered more relevant than coding properties and given
prevalence when defining grammatical relations. This is explicit, for example, in Van54Valin (2002:274) who says “grammatical relations exist in a language only where the
behavioral patterns of a language give evidence of a syntactic relation independent of
semantic and pragmatic relations.” Constructions often mentioned to show evidence for
grammatical relations (e.g. passivization, relativization, reflexivization, cross-reference
tracking, possessor raising, purposive constructions, coordinate constructions, etc.) must
be identified language specifically.
However, the amount and kind of evidence needed to argue for the existence of
grammatical relations seems controversial. For instance, for Comrie, “a number of
logically independent criteria must be established that serve to identify the grammatical
relation in question as being syntactically significant in the language in question”
(Comrie 1991:66). However, Van Valin (2002:205) argues that “there are purely
syntactic grammatical relations in a language if there is at least one construction with a
restricted neutralization of semantic and pragmatic relations for syntactic purposes.”
While some authors want a set of multiple criteria, others find one construction is
enough evidence to posit a grammatical relation.
Although there is some controversy around grammatical relations even within
the Functional-Typological approaches, there seems to be a general sense that subject
and (direct) object are the most central relations and display more grammatical
consequences in most languages. In contrast, indirect object occupies an intermediate
status (compared to subject/object and obliques) in terms of number of languages that
have it as a clear category (Givón 2001:108). Cross-linguistic properties associated with
indirect objects may not exist. In consequence, in some languages, the status of indirect55objects is dubious. Usually clause elements that are called indirect objects have the
same formal properties as either direct objects or obliques (Comrie 1991:67-68, T.
Payne 1997:379). This study adds to the literature on languages that show convincing
evidence for subject and object, but not for indirect object, or for a grammatical “second
object” of any kind.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]"
"709In the pragmatic dimension, the pura-marked NP expresses various subtypes of
focus, generally distinguished via constituent order. When the pura-marked NP is the O
in the SVO pattern, it correlates strongly with non-contrastive focus. When the
pura-marked NP is the O in the OSV pattern, it correlates strongly with contrastive
focus. However, in KK, Dik et al.‟s (1981) finer distinctions within the contrastive
category are neutralized. That is to say that the semantic operations such as selection,
restriction, expansion, etc., are all expressed by the same structure. To express Watters‟
exhaustive listing focus, =pura interacts with the clitic =nan „only‟.
In sentence-focus constructions, the morpheme =pura exhibits a delimitative
function. Here, =pura marks the first element of the focus domain, then focal stress
occurs towards the end of the focused unit. Interestingly, it is possible to posit that in
sentence-focus constructions, the distribution of =pura follows a nominative pattern: in
the formal dimension the subject of either intransitive or transitive clauses are
unstressed NPs and are marked by =pura. In the pragmatic dimension, the subject of the
clause is not the topic and the whole sentence is asserted. In other words, the
nominative pattern plus prosodic peak are central for distinguishing sentence focus from
the range of narrow-focus constructions. Once the hearer knows that i) the subject is
marked by =pura; and ii) it is unstressed, he knows that this is a sentence focus
construction. In contrast, once the hearer knows that i) any non-subject is marked by
=pura; and, ii) it is stressed, this is a narrow-focus construction. A less frequent pattern
(as in 31) shows that stress marks the beginning and =pura the end of the unit under710focus. An additional way of focusing the whole sentence is by attaching =pura to the
negative particle, whose scope is the entire clause.
Overall, the principal results of this study are that the clitic =pura is an important
cue to identify focus constructions — every utterance that includes =pura has a
pragmatically marked focus structure — and that the distribution and function of =pura
in KK discourse is part of a coherent functional system that cannot be understood
without considering multiple interacting factors from morphosyntax, pragmatics, and
prosody.
In §11.2.1, it was mentioned that languages express different types of focus at
the level of sentence grammar. From the two parameters that characterize focus —scope
and pragmatic information— the existence of constructions dedicated to code scope
seems clear. The results of this study support this claim. In KK, the scope of the focused
unit correlates consistently with specific structures. That is, what is clearly coded in KK
is whether a construction has narrow or broad focus structure. When focal stress and
=pura co-occur, it marks a narrow-focus construction; when the subject is marked by
=pura and is unstressed, it marks a sentence-focus construction.
The typological existence of constructions dedicated to pragmatic contrast,
however, has been in dispute. One of the most cited cases of explicit coding of contrast
is that of Aghem. The major conclusions of Watters (1979) are that Aghem has explicit
structures to express specific types of focus, but above all, that Aghem formally
distinguishes contrastive from non-contrastive focus. That is, his findings support the
idea that contrast is a possible grammatical category. However, it is risky to generalize711from his findings as his study is limited to simple-declarative sentences, which were
elicited or construed by the author and tested with one speaker (Watters 1979:141). In
contrast, other studies have found that languages often do not have constructions
devoted to specific types of focus, nor specifically to contrast (Vries 1985). In the same
vein, Lambrecht (1994), after analyzing mostly made-up examples, argues that stress in
English is by no means confined to expressing contrast. He concludes that since a
contrastive interpretation is available but not obligatory, contrast belongs to
conversational implicature rather than to grammar. Lambrecht adds that the problem
seems to be a lack of an operational definition of contrast. Myhill and Xing (1996)
attempt to solve the methodological issue on how to recognize contrast in discourse
data. They operationalize Chafe‟s (1976) definition of contrast —a set of alternatives
for the role being contrasted— and look at discourse in Chinese and Biblical Hebrew.
They conclude that neither language presents a construction devoted to contrastive
focus. Further, they suggest that a categorical correspondence between one construction
and one type of focus may not exist.
In KK, however, there are constructions that clearly distinguish contrastive from
non-contrastive focus. Recall from §11.2.3.2 that 83% (n=74) of the [O=pura S V]
constructions expressed contrast following the operational definition proposed by
Myhill and Xing‟s (1996). The remaining examples (n=15, 17%) did not fulfill Myhill
and Xing‟s requirement as clear alternatives could not be traced in the previous
discourse, or, in Lambrecht‟s words, the relevant presuppositions were not always
lexico-grammatically evoked. Interestingly, also Myhill and Xing did find “clear cases712of implicit contrast” (1996:320). However, in KK, this subset of examples can be
accounted for when we recognize that contrast can be built on the basis of shared
cultural knowledge. Although operational definitions are important as a means of
avoiding circularity, we cannot ignore the danger of restricting our attention to only
overtly stated discourse context and thereby underestimating the importance of the
“universe of discourse.” In conclusion, KK suggests that we need to provide a place in
the grammar for dedicated contrastive focus constructions.
11.3. Selection of pronominal forms: grammar and discourse
As introduced in Chapter III, and pointed out throughout this dissertation, KK
has three sets of forms for expressing pronominal referents: long form free pronouns,
short form free pronouns, and enclitics. Upon looking at them, some questions arise: do
the different forms correspond to different meanings or functions? If yes, what kinds of
factors drive the choice of one form or another at the moment of the utterance? This
section is an attempt to answer those questions by examining natural discourse.
11.3.1. Assumptions and hypothesis
It has been noticed that the structure of expressions and their conceptualizations
seems to follow certain general principles. The principle of iconicity assumes that: i)
ideally, there is a coding relationship between one expression and one meaning, and ii)
the conceptual simplicity of a notion corresponds to the simplicity of its expression
(Croft 1993, Givón 1985, 1991, Haiman 1983). For example, the formal distance
between linguistic expressions may be an iconically motivated index of the conceptual
distance between the terms or events that they denote. It is also argued that functional-713cognitive principles, such as economy of mental effort, mediate specific instances of
iconicity in grammar (Givon 1991).
As for the existence of multiple forms with the “same” referent in the languages of
the world, Haiman (1983) points out:
Through sound change or borrowing, a language acquires doublets -more
or less synonymous ways of saying the same thing. […] True synonyms do
not long endure: presented with a minimally contrasting pair of
expressions, speakers will attempt to associate appropriately contrasting
meaning with them. What seems „appropriate‟ to speakers may often be
what is iconically motivated (Haiman 1983:800).
Though the existence of multiple forms could have historical explanations, I will
do not discuss their history here. Rather, what I want to explore is the modern forces
that drive their distribution in natural texts.
A first look at the properties of pronominal forms in the language indicates that
in certain constructions, only certain pronominal forms are allowed, whereas in others,
any pronominal form is accepted. The hypothesis behind this section is then that, in
constructions where multiple forms are grammatical, the pragmatic information status
of the referent correlates with speaker‟s choices of pronominal forms in actual use. That
is, speakers, by using these three sets of forms, give different amounts of information to
the hearers, establishing an iconic relationship between the phonological size of the
grammatical form and the amount of information that it carries. By “amount of
information” I mean the quality and quantity of semantic-pragmatic instructions that the714speaker gives in order for the hearer to build mental representations within the universe
of discourse.
Since personal pronouns are definite and referring by definition, notions such as
referentiality and definiteness do not seem to be helpful in explaining the data.
However, I will refer to the pragmatic function of focus as introduced in §11.1.2,
because it proves to be relevant in describing the functions of the different pronominal
forms in KK.
11.3.2. Long forms, short forms and clitics
As introduced in Chapter V, KK has three sets of pronominal forms: long form
free pronouns, short form free pronouns, and enclitics. The language also distinguishes
between masculine speech (MS) and feminine speech (FS) in the pronominal
paradigms; gender is marked according to the speaker and not in reference to what they
are talking about. The opposition between long and short free pronouns is only available
in the singular — specifically in first person feminine speech, second person feminine
and masculine speech, and third person masculine speech, whereas the opposition
between independent forms versus enclitics is present through the whole paradigm.
The complete paradigm of pronouns for female speech (FS) and male speech
(MS) is resented in Table 11.3. Notice the differences in form according to speaker‟s
gender for first singular, third singular, first plural exclusive and third plural. There is
an additional set of enclitic forms exclusively for third person object that were not
included in the table below. These are: =ay / =ura for female/male speech respectively.","[738, 739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744]"

Answers to polar questions are in principle either yes or no. Example (113a),

subordinate verb „speak.‟ A positive answer to this question could minimally consist of
the main verb alone (114a), but it can also include the main and the subordinate clause
(114b), or include the subject in between the two verbs (114c)

Content questions — also known as information questions or constituent
questions — are formed by means of interrogative words. Cross-linguistically, some of
the strategies used to form polar questions are also attested in content questions, but
their use seems less wide-spread. For instance, morphological marking and intonation
may be optional (König & Siemund 2007). This is the case in KK.
KK content questions involve interrogative pronouns, and only optionally the
interrogative morpheme =tipa. The complete set of KK interrogative words is
presented in Table 9.9, which combines Table 5.7 and Table 5:8.

"463speech acts of statements, inquiry, and requests. However, the correlation between
sentence types and speech acts is by no means one-to-one. For instance, although in KK
declarative sentences are employed primarily to make statements and claims about the
world, in the appropriate context they can also be employed to elicit information, to
convey a request, to express a wish, etc.
I start the discussion with an outline of a simple verbal clause construction in
KK (§9.1). Here I list the main elements that occur within a simple verbal clause. Next I
discuss constituent ordering, a key aspect in the characterization of verbal constructions
in KK (§9.1.1). In KK, two grammatical categories that are typically characterized at
the verb-level, in other languages must be described at the clause level. These are tense
(§9.1.1.3) and modality (9.1.2).
The second part of this chapter is dedicated to the grammatical devices that the
language employs to perform different speech acts. In §9.2, I describe declarative
sentences. I start with a formal characterization of the grammatical relations of subject
and object, and contrast them with obliques (§9.2.1), and then discuss the functional
load of declarative sentences (§9.2.2). From a semantic-functional perspective,
negative clauses could be considered a subtype of declarative clauses; however, for
reasons of clarity in the presentation, they are discussed in their own section (§9.3). In
§9.4, I present interrogative sentences, including polar and content questions. Directive
sentences, discussed in §9.5, is a category that subsumes several constructions,
including imperative, polite imperative, exhortative, jussive, invitation, prohibition, and
future/irrealis prohibition.","[492, 493]"
"Interrogative sentences
Interrogative clauses are typically used for eliciting information. The languagehas two types of questions: polar questions and content questions. Polar questions are
created by means of the second position clitic =tipa plus a word order alternation.
Information questions are formed by means of interrogative pronouns.
Faust (1972:88) claims that Kokama has a third type of interrogative
construction: indirect questions. Faust indicates that, in addition to =tipa, Kokama has
three other interrogative suffixes, -taku,-raku and -nda, which she says are employed to
create indirect questions. Cabral (1995:216, 351) echoes this claim. Here are the
examples provided by Faust (1972:88). The orthographic adaptation, glossing and
translation are mine.

According to my analysis, examples (102a-c) are in fact questions. They are
content questions, not because of the suffixes -nda, -raku, or -taku but rather because
they involve the interrogative pronoun awa „who.‟ Contrast these with Faust‟s example
(102d), which does not include an interrogative pronoun, and whose primary
interpretation is hence not that of a question but a weak statement (see §9.4.2 for a
discussion of content questions). As for the markers themselves, -taku (=taka, in this
variety) indicates uncertain modality (see §9.1.2.1.4). The forms -raku and -nda are not
attested in the database for this study. In conclusion, in this variety, only =tipa operates
as an interrogative marker.
In the following paragraphs I describe in some detail polar questions (§9.4.1)
and content questions (§9.4.2).
9.4.1. Polar questions
Polar question are typically employed to inquire about the truth or falsity of the
proposition they express often with focus on one specific part of the proposition (Givón
2001). Cross-linguistically, six strategies to encode polar questions have been found.
These are “(i) special intonation patterns, (ii) interrogative particles, (iii) the addition of
special tags, (iv) disjunctive-negative structures, (v) a change in the relative order of537constituents and (vi) particular verbal inflection” (König & Siemund, 2007:292). KK
employs three of these strategies to form polar questions: the interrogative particle
=tipa, constituent order alternation, and, more marginally, intonation.

However, the certainty marker does not indicate or correlate with contrast, as isdemonstrated in examples from connected speech. In the text database, the utterances
highlighted as certain are consistently presented as factual events. This is exemplified in
(26). Note that =tin attaches to the first constituent of the clause, which in (26a-b)

Examples in (26a-c) present events as realized and concluded. However, the
utterance under speaker‟s evaluation can also make reference to events that have been
happening from an earlier point in time, but which still apply at the moment of the
utterance. For instance, example (27a) is taken from a context in which the speaker says
the Kokamas have traditionally had big families. He says that this has been true in the
past and is still true now. Example (27b) shows a similar temporal scenario. The context
for this example is this: leaders from several villages traveled to a city and received488some donations. The speaker says that the other leaders decided to give the heavy stuff
to him because his village is closer to the city, the other leaders live further away. The
fact that he will go to a close place is presented as certain, and it will surely continue to
be certain after the moment of the utterance. Similarly, in (27c) the fact that „over there
the dollar doesn‟t exist‟ has a habitual reading.

chɨpɨ-yara=tin=ura „it is costly‟ is a non-verbal predicate and is produced without
pauses. However, chɨpɨ-yara „has a price‟ is the predicate phrase, and ura indicates the
subject „it‟. So, =tin attaches to the predicate phrase, which is the first constituent in the
clause and then the pronoun follows.

Spanish si „yes.‟ The reason for that is perhaps the fact that the form -ti, which by
speakers‟ intuitions is related to -tin, sporadically shows up in short-positive answers.
This is not the typical pattern for short answers, though, as will be shown in §9.4.1. The
following exchange comes from a text about the presence of the Kokama-Kokamillas in
this area of the Amazon. Speaker A asserts that Kokamas can be found in a particular
village. Speaker B agrees with the propositional content of Speaker A‟s utterance by
using -ti. The appearance of -ti in the database is extremely rare.

„Yes, also (there)‟This brings us to the clitic =tika which shows up in a few utterances in my
corpus. Interestingly enough, =tika seems to contain =ti. However, there are reasons to
not categorize =tika as another member of the set MOD1. The main reason for not
doing that is that the set of MOD1 clitics do not co-occur. Although =tika is a second
position clitic, it does co-occur with =tin, as in (30). In that sense =tika behaves
differently than the others.

„He finds […] that (which) is a huge rock‟490Meaning wise, =tika also conveys certainty but, unlike =tin, the same degree of
certainty is also expected from the addressee. In every instance of =tika, the utterance
makes reference to a proposition which is assumed to be also known by the hearer. The
semantics of =tika could be paraphrased as “it is true, you and I know that.” Consider
the examples in (31) which come from two traditional stories. The last portion of (31a)
could be paraphrased „as you and I know, shamans sing cure-songs.‟ Example in (31b)
implies that both speaker and addressee know about this creature called ururi.

The marker =tika also combines with the negative particle tɨma. In these cases
the negative marker does not have scope over the proposition. On the contrary, the
sequence tɨma-tika is translated into Amazonian Spanish as No pues/no es cierto? „Isn‟t
it true?‟ and the resulting sentences get interpreted as rhetorical questions (cf. 32). In
(32a), the proposition „woman throw blood monthly‟ is not negated but positively
asserted. The discourse context for (32b) is this: a man sees someone and takes a guess
that is his son; then his wife clarifies that that is not their son by reminding him their491son went somewhere else. That is, in (32b) she not only asserts that „he went to the
forest‟ but tɨmatika works as a reminder, implying that he knows that.

The fact that =tin, =ti, and =tika are not only phonologically related but also
semantically associated with strong assertions suggests a connection among them. It
could be hypothesized, for instance, that the certainty marker =tin consists of -ti plus the
nominalizer -n. At this point, however, this will have to remain as an untestable
hypothesis.

4.5.3. Positionaly flexible clitics
This category consists of the morphemes that can show up in various positions
within the clause. Less-fixed clitics differ from what in this study are called particles in
that the former are bound, whereas the latter generally appear phonologically
independent. In KK, focus markers are typical examples of less-fixed clitics.
4.5.3.1. Focus marker =pura
The morpheme =pura combines with a wide range of stems and lacks a fixed
position in the sentence. As expected of clitics, =pura occurs appended to the last word
of a constituent or phrase. On nouns, however, =pura exhibits an odd distribution
because it occurs word-internally, occupying a slot position close to the root. That is,
they show up between derivational morphemes and the evaluative morphemes as is
shown in the following examples:
(34)tsuwɨ=pura

turtle-FOC-AUG-PL.F„the HUGE TURTLES‟167panara-pan=pura=kana

pronouns (49), interrogative pronouns (50), and particles (51).

This morpheme has been attested on a restricted set of verbs, includingyaparachi „dance‟, ikara „sing‟, utsu „go,‟ among a few others. The frequency of =pura
on verbs is very low compared to its frequency on nouns. Also, in the majority of cases,
the host verb is not the nucleus of the clause and, without a nominalizer, can have a
nominal interpretation (48a). Also, the verb tends to be the predicate of a dependent
clause (48b).

"Speculative =rayCompared to the certainty marker, =ray expresses a slightly weaker degree of
commitment to the truth of the utterance. Based on the pragmatic context, prior
experiences, recollections, etc. the speaker speculates about the certainty of the state of
affairs expressed in the utterance. It is translated into Amazonian Spanish as (así es)492pues which could be translated into in English as „so it is/that‟s how it must be.‟
Sentences with =ray acquire a connotation of inference, but also of high probability and
conviction towards what is being said, something like „I haven‟t been there/seen it, but
it seems to be the case.‟ In that sense, =ray indicates a greater likelihood that the
proposition holds true compared to the possibility clitic (see §9.1.2.1.4).

In texts, =ray also appears attached to the quotative particle na to indicate that
the previous utterance is a direct quotation, which is itself a strategy to down tone the
degree of commitment to the truth of the preposition expressed in the utterance. In
493general, KK narratives are rich in quotes, which are also a conversational rhetorical
device. So structures like the ones in (35) are extremely common in discourse.

Traditional stories are usually built around mythical creatures, and very often

important role. By using na=ray speakers denote unconfirmed information, a general
rumor; a sort of strategy to mark second-hand information. Interestingly, the marker for

Second, most grammatical categories that, across-languages, are encoded as inflectional
morphology (e.g., number, tense, and mood (Bybee 1985:30-31)) in KK are conveyed
by means of categorically unrestricted cltics and syntactic strategies ike auxiliaries. Five
tense clitics encode three degrees of distance in the past and two in the future, although
one of the future markers (-a) is becoming obsolete. There are also six epistemic modal
clitics: four second position clitics that convey speaker-oriented modality and two verb
phrase clitics that encode event-oriented modality. These two sets interact to create a
four-way modal system.
The language has twelve suffixes, the majority of which could be located
towards the derivational end of the continuum. None of the twelve suffixes is
obligatory, but in texts, it is common to find verbs with as many as four suffixes and
two clitics.
There are three major non-verbal predicate constructions (juxtaposition of noun
phrases, existential constructions, and adverbial predicates) for expressing functions
such as proper inclusion, equation, attribution, location, existence, and possession. It is
worth pointing out that that the language has no special construction dedicated to
indicating possession; rather, possession is inferred in several constructions, mainly
varieties of the existential.
KK has intransitive and transitive clauses, but semantically three-place
predicates are syntactically encoded by means of transitive clauses. Formal evidence
shows that clauses with three syntactic arguments do not exist in KK. In clauses750containing semantically three-place predicates, every test applied shows that only two
of them are syntactically coded as core arguments in a single clause. In addition, there
are two morphemes whose basic functions are to increase the valence of verbs: the
causative -ta and the applicative -tsupe. While both morphemes entail the introduction
of new participants into the scene, from a syntactic point of view the derived patterns
never contain more than two syntactic arguments. Thus, KK confirms the prediction
that derived valence patterns do not add arguments beyond the maximum number
allowed by non-derived valence patterns (Haspelmath & Muller-Bradey 2004).
There are seven directive constructions that distinguish degrees of pragmatic
force. They range from basic second-person imperatives (Do it!), rogatives (Please do
it!), exhortatives (Go do it!), jussives (Let‟s do it), and polite requests (Come in, do it!),
prohibitives (Don‟t do it!), and postponed prohibitives (You/someone won‟t do it!).
From a functional perspective, the directive constructions primarily try to get others to
do things, differing mainly with respect to the level of control over the outcome,
imperative and prohibitive conveying the strongest obligation on the part of the
addressee.
In KK, adverbial clauses show different degrees of clause integration with the
main clause. By definition, adverbial clauses are not expected to share arguments with
the matrix clause. However, the language has three purpose clauses which differ in
terms of coreference: two of them obligatorily have an argument that is coreferential
with the absolutive argument of the main clause, the third obligatorily has no
coreferential arguments. Specifically, -tara indicates that the missing argument in the751subordinate clause is the S/A; -mira indicates that the missing argument in the
dependent clause is the O, and -tsen has no missing arguments. Thus, although the
controller of the coreference in adverbial clauses is the absolutive, the target of that
control is nominative or accusative. As a result, the choice between -tara and -mira is
predicted by grammar, while the choice between -mira/-tara and -tsen is pragmatically
driven.
Clause nominalization is a central subordination strategy, particularly in
relativization, which is largely achieved via an absolutive nominalizer. The arguments S
and O are relativized by suffixing -n to the subordinate verb; the A argument is
relativized by suffixing -tara to the subordinate verb. Dative phrases (recipients and
benefactives) pattern with locatives in terms of relativization; they are relativized by
gapping and the relativizer -tupa. The positions that access to relativization are O
(theme, causee, recipient and applicative objects), S (active, stative), A (transitive), and
OBL (location, dative).
Pragmatically, KK has constructions that explicitly distinguish subtypes of focus
according to scope (narrow/broad) and pragmatic information (contrastive/noncontrastive). This bears on theories about whether contrast simply emerges from
conversational implicature versus whether it is explicitly coded by dedicated grammar.
Information structure also explains the distribution of alternating pronominal forms
(long forms, short forms, and clitics) and several constituent orders. A frequency study
found that the SV(O) order is the pragmatically unmarked pattern in the language,
appearing in about 94% of declarative sentences. In addition, it was demonstrated that752salient information is placed in first position in the sentence; thus, the OSV pattern is
the result of focalizing the O argument. Background and foreground information is
relevant to explain the use of tense-marked clauses, progressive-marked clauses, and
unmarked clauses (for tense and aspect). First, progressive-marked clauses signal
descriptive, often evaluative information that breaks the temporal sequence of main
events. Second, the mainline or foreground information is mostly signaled by unmarked
clauses. The temporal frame is established at the beginning of the discourse by means of
adverbs and/or tense-marked clauses. Third, tense-marked clauses tend to occur at key
moments of the plot to reaffirm the temporal frame, to resume the plot, and to
manipulate the temporal-deictic point.
A final point that needs to be made is with respect to the genetic classification of
KK. Though long classified as Tupí-Guaraní (TG), Cabral (1995, 2007) claims that KK
is the product of a contact language situation and hence has a mixed grammar. Based on
the patterns presented in this dissertation, this claim is basically accurate, although open
questions remain regarding the mechanism of disruption and convergence, as well as
which languages contributed to the mix.
As for the Tupian origin of the KK people, there is a consensus among
anthropologists and historians alike that the KK and Omaguas living in Peru are
descendents of the Tupí ethnic group. As been pointed out by Lathtrap 1970, Chaumeil
1981, and Rivas 2000, among many others, the early chonicles clearly report the
migration of Tupí groups from Eastern Brazil towards the Western Amazon centuries
prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers. That is, prior Tupian presence in the region is753out of the question. However, the fact that the main vocabulary of KK is of Tupí origin
clearly shows that a Tupían language was crucially involved in the genesis of the
language.
Cabral puts forward a series of hypotheses with respect to the genesis of the
grammar of Kokama. She claims that Kokama, and its sister language Omagua, arose in
a short period of time in the missionary villages in the province of Maynas (Peru) by the
end of the 17th century (1995:307). According to Cabral, Kokama and Omagua were
promoted as lingua francas by the missionaries, and thus became the language of
evangelization to indigenous peoples of several ethnic backgrounds. Further, she argues
that Kokama and Omagua grammar are the result of imperfect adult learning of a
formerly more complex Tupí-Guaraní pattern, and she thus categorizes them as abrupt
creoles. Abrupt creoles do not require crystallized pidgins and entail significant
disruption in the transmission of grammatical patterns (Thomason and Kaufman 1988,
Muysken 2008).
The crucial evidence for imperfect learning is the simplification of the Pro-Tupí
Guaraní (PTG) cross-reference system (i.e., four sets of person markers) and the
fossilization of PTG instances of prefixes and suffixes. Interestingly, though, a number
of TG languages have simplified the cross-reference system in various ways (Jensen
1997), from maximal (cf. Tocantis Asurini, Tapiparé) to minimal (cf. Wayampi) to nonexistent (cf. Urubu-Kaapor). As for the fossilization of TG morphology, a look at the
forms provided by Cabral (1995:64-73) reveals that the retained forms are far from
random; on the contrary, on nouns the vast majority of frozen elements are the754relational prefix *i- (about 98%), and the nominal case suffix -a (about 96%). As for
verbs, the majority has retained the third person singular *o- (about 72%) or the first
person plural inclusive *ja (18%). Similar phenomena are not strange in the literature
on grammaticalization.
From the features typically associated with creoles (Hancock 1986, Arends et al.
1995), KK exhibits grammaticalization of content words (e.g., auxiliaries,
interrogatives, etc.), vast use of clitics to convey tense and modality, and minimal
presence of affixes. Yet at the same time, creole features not found in KK include verb
serialization, plural derived from a third person pronoun, complex reflexives, a
generalized locative, negation with a simple preverbal particle and collapse of aspects.
In fact, KK has five postpositions that indicate different types of location and direction,
several ways of indicating various aspectual nuances, six degrees of speaker-oriented
modality, two mechanisms of negation, etc. Overall, KK has a far more elaborated
grammar than typical creoles; thus, categorizing KK solely in structural grounds —i.e.,
in comparison with prototypical creoles— is problematic.
However, the crucial point that needs to be explained is the fact that KK —or at
least the variety described in this study— has retained an important number of PTG
elements (see Table 12.1, based on Jensen 1998, Cabral 1995, Rodrigues 1984/1985, as
well as new observations highlighted throughout this dissertation). What this suggests is
that the disruption of grammatical patterns, although significant, was not as dramatic as
in typical abrupt creoles (i.e., Afrikaans, Caribean creoles).","[778, 779, 780, 781, 782, 783, 784]"

In this study, particles are understood as positionally variable and generallyphonological independent morphemes. The most productive particles are the negative
morphemes, quotatives, intersentential connectors, and several other elements with
modality readings. In the following paragraphs I give examples of each, and point
where in the dissertation they are discussed more fully.",[199]

Another highly frequent quantifier is chita „all.‟ This quantifier is versatile in the
sense that syntactically it can operate as adverb or verb. The examples in (143) illustrate
its modifying function.

abundant fish.

Another strategy to derive indefinite quantifiers is to combine them with the
negative particles tɨma and ni. The elicited examples in (146) demonstrate this. In
(146a), the combination NEG + „many‟ produces „a few,‟ in (146b) NEG + „one‟
produces „none.‟ Example (146c) shows the negative existential operating as a
quantifier.

As for the other quantifiers listed in (137) and (138), they behave in essentially
the same way as the ones discussed so far. Below I include examples that illustrate the
use of some of them. Example (147a) comes from a text about the origins of the
Kokamilla subgroup. Example in (147b) was produced in the following context: the
speaker is talking about the fact that in a particular region, the majority of inhabitants
are Kokamas. Then, in (147b) he points out that only a handful of them are of different

language: by the juxtaposition of two nouns, 15 or by a short clitic pronoun and a noun.","[300, 301, 302, 303]"
"66811.1. Information structure
In this document, information structure is understood as the component of
grammar that deals with the study of grammatical patterns driven by pragmatic forces.
As Lambrecht puts it, information structure is concerned with psychological phenomena
such as the speaker‟s hypotheses about the hearer‟s mental states “only inasmuch as
they are reflected in grammatical structure.” (1994:3). It should be pointed out that
information structure differs from (conversational) pragmatics, in that the latter is
concerned with the interpretations of sentences that emerge from conversational
settings. That is to say, “while conversational pragmatics is concerned with the
question of why one and the same sentence form may express two or more meanings,
discourse pragmatics is concerned with the question of why one and the same
[propositional] meaning may be expressed by two or more sentence forms.” (Lambrecht
1994:5). A basic claim of information structure is then that different constructions that
seem to be describing the “same” scene in a single language express different ways of
conceptualizing that scene. That is, different constructions appear to have a different
conceptual content (cf. also Croft 1993).
It has been found that languages exhibit a number of strategies speakers use to
give the hearers instructions about how to integrate incoming information into the
mental representation of the discourse (Chafe 1987, Payne 1993, Mithun 1993). KK is
no exception in that it displays several mechanisms to attract the hearer‟s attention to
the structure of the discourse, including: focal stress, intonation contours, constituent
order, different pronominal forms, specialized morphology, etc. Overall, the grammar669of KK adds to the literature that supports general claims regarding the interrelation
between grammar and discourse.
11.1.1. Assertion and presupposition
For the purposes of this document, it is assumed that two fundamental categories
of information structure are: 1) what is part of the already established common ground
between the speaker and hearer; and, 2) what the speaker wants the hearer to come to
realize by making the utterance. It is said that most, or perhaps all, of communication
relies on the relationship between these two cognitive categories, by relating a new idea
to some kind of background or knowledge (Givón 1995). When a speaker makes a
statement, he makes an assertion. This is a proposition the speaker hopes the addressee
will come to know or be aware of as a result of the sentence. Following Lambrecht
(1994:52), assertion is “the proposition expressed by a sentence which the hearer is
expected to know or believe or take for granted as a result of hearing the sentence
uttered.” On the other hand, the set of assumptions that make up the context necessary
for understanding the utterance is called the presupposition. In Lambrecht‟s words,
presupposition is “the set of propositions lexico-grammatically evoked in an utterance
which the speaker assumes the hearer already knows or believes or is ready to take for
granted at the time of speech” (1994:52).
11.1.2. Focus as a pragmatic notion
For the purposes of this study, we assume Lambrecht‟s fundamental categories
of information structure: presuppositions (the common ground between the speaker and
hearer), and assertions (what the speaker wants the hearer to realize by making the
670utterance). Related to these is the term focus, which is defined in different ways. While
for Dik et al. (1981), focus is the pragmatic function attaching to the most important or
salient information, for Chafe (1976) it is an attention-getting mechanism, and for
Jackendoff (1972:230) it is the information which the speaker assumes or knows the
hearer does not share with him. Lambrecht (1994) defines focus as the semantic element
that is unpredictable or unrecoverable from the context and which makes a proposition
into an assertion. That is, focus is “the semantic component of a pragmatically
structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the presupposition”
(Lambrecht 1994:213).
Following Lambrecht, by focus construction I understand a semantically
complex construction that results from the superposition of two propositions. For
instance, the semantic structure of a sentence like (1a) consists of a proposition with an
open variable X (1b) and one that instantiates, or re-instantiates the value of X (1c):
(1)a. It‟s the kid who is crying.
b. Someone is crying. (Fx)
c. It‟s the kid. (x = a)
A focus construction thus consists of a presupposed part (1b), information that ispresumed to be already accessible to the addressee, and an asserted part (1c),
information that the speaker assumes is not already shared by the addressee. The
presupposed proposition can be contained within the utterance itself, as in the case of
(1), but it can also be derived from the pragmatic context. For example, (1c) may follow
a crying sound in the surroundings that the speaker assumes to have been noticed by the671addressee. As for the assertive part of focus constructions, in our example the
variable-instantiation (X=kid) is overtly signaled by the cleft construction.
Dik et al. (1981) and Watters (1979) claim the existence of unmarked focus
constructions, i.e., focus neutral; but Lambrecht (1994) argues that no sentence is
pragmatically-neutral, i.e., without information structure. For him, pragmaticallyunmarked constructions are those whose domain of application is larger compared to
pragmatically-marked constructions. That is, given two semantically equivalent but
formally and pragmatically divergent sentences, “one is unmarked if it serves two
discourse functions while the other serves only one of them” (1994:17). Lambrecht then
proposes predicate-focus structure as the universally unmarked type of focus
construction. For instance, a sentence like she likes tea could have predicate focus
because it could be a reply to „tell us about her‟. In this case, „she‟ is the common
ground, and what is the focus of assertion is the predicate, „likes tea.‟ But it could also
be an answer to „does she like coffee or tea?‟, in which case the focus of assertion is just
„tea.‟
In one typology, focus subtypes can be characterized according to two
parameters: pragmatic information (contrastiveness) and scope. In what follows, I
discuss both parameters, and briefly introduce the typologies proposed by Dik et al.
(1981), Lambrecht (1994), and Watters (1979). The table below compares the
distinctions and terminology suggested by these authors.","[697, 698, 699, 700, 701]"

Example (1a) is a finite transitive clause. In (1b) there is a complex noun phrasethat contains a nominalized clause. Note the nominalized verb in final position, suffixed569by the nominalizer -n, and then by the affective and focus morpheme, which show that
this syntactic unit is a NP. This NP could in turn appear embedded in a matrix clause.
We now go on to examine each of the various ways in which KK combines clauses.
10.2 . Complement clauses
Complement clauses are defined as constructions in which a clause is the
syntactic argument of a matrix clause. The embedded clause can potentially assume
either subject or object argument function.
In KK, complement clauses are morphologically unmarked and restricted to
object function. The embedded clause and the matrix clause may or may not share
verbal arguments. Depending on the semantic type of the matrix verb the embedded
clause is fully finite, keeping its full array of arguments. Then, a complement sentence
construction includes a matrix clause with the subject in first position, a complementtaking-verb (CTV), and an embedded clause acting as its direct object. The complement
construction could be schematically summarized as: [S V1 [(S) V2 (O)]]. Examples with
the prototypical CTV tseta „want‟ are given in (2) and (3); the embedded clause is in
brackets.

1PL.EX.M=PAS3tana]=tsuriay
1PL.EX.M=PAS3 (ED)From these examples, the first generalization we can make is that complement
clauses follow the matrix verb. Second, the embedded verb can be intransitive (2a-b),
transitive (3a), or derived transitive (3b). As discussed in Chapter VIII, one of the key
features to determine the structure of a clause is the placement of the tense clitics. In
complement clauses, tense clitics attach to the right edge of the embedded construction,
as in (2b) and (3b). Also, note the distribution of the adverb amutse „far‟ in (3a), which
appears at the very end of the clause. The adverb is not part of the embedded clause
because, upon elicitation, it can also appear in first position without any semantic
consequences. As for negation, in Chapter IX we learned that KK has two negative
particles: tɨma and ni. The former negates the entire construction by placing it in front
of the clause or in front of the verb phrase, the latter negates only the argument that
follows it. In (2b) and (3b) tɨma negates the whole complex sentence, but it cannot571negate the dependent clause alone; that is, it cannot be placed between the matrix verb
„want‟ and the dependent verb aki „get in‟ (2c) or akita „let in‟ (3c).
In KK complement constructions, modal markers only appear in the matrix
clause, not within the complement clause. In (4a) the second position modal =ray
„speculative‟ is attached to the subject of „want‟, and in (4b), the modal clitic =mia
„irrealis‟ appears at the edge of the complement clause, which coincides with the end of
the verb phrase.

deer=MODIt is well documented that, cross-linguistically, the grammar of complementation
is one of the clearest expressions of iconicity in syntax (Givón 2001). The basic
prediction is that: “the stronger is the semantic bond between the two events, the more
extensive will be the syntantic integration of the two clauses into a single though
complex clause” (Givon 2001:40). To examine this principle, verbs are often classified
into three categories: modality verbs, manipulation verbs, and perception-cognitionutterance (PCU) verbs. The claim is that the first two types of verbs semantically
indicate events with the strongest bond, hence the complement clause often presents
greater syntactic integration with the matrix clause; the third group shows the weakest
semantic-cognitive bond between events, and hence generally the least syntactic
integration of the complement clause.
572In KK complementation, the iconicity principle manifests not in terms of
morphological coding, but in terms of co-reference restrictions that hold between the
subject or object of the main clause and the subject of the complement clause. However,
among the three types of verbs suggested by Givón, only complement clauses with
modality and PCU main verbs display syntactic differences compared to each other.
Manipulation verbs are not a type on their own. Typologically, in complement clauses
with manipulation verbs the object of the main clause is coreferentialial with the subject
of the complement clause, where it is left unexpressed. Some of the prototypical
manipulation verbs are: „allow‟, „cause‟, „make‟, „tell‟, „ask‟, and „order.‟(Givón 2001).
KK does not have verbs for „allow‟ and „cause‟ — although causation is an extremely
productive derivational process— and „make‟ does not function as a manipulation verb.
The only manipulation verbs in the language would be wanakari „order,‟ piyata
„ask‟and kumitsa + DAT „tell‟.1 Yet these would be better characterized as utterance
verbs, as they occur mostly with direct and indirect quotes. Most importantly, the quotes
are syntactically independent, so these verbs do not take complement clauses.
In what follows, I discuss complementation with modality verbs (§10.2.1) and
PCU verbs (§10.2.2), then close the section with a discussion of the syntax of clauses
with quotes (§10.2.3).
10.2.1 . Modality verbs
In clauses with modality verbs, the complement clause lacks independent tenseaspect-mood marking and appears in the typical object position, generally under the
1Recall that the verb kumitsa „speak' is interpreted as „say‟ if it occurs with an object, and „tell‟ if with a
dative phrase : kumitsa „speak‟, [kumitsa OBJ] „say‟, [kumitsa DAT] „tell‟.","[598, 599, 600, 601, 602]"
"Compounds
A compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one stem. From aphonological perspective, the combination of stems constitutes a single word with one
stress. Compounding is an important strategy in KK for creating new lexical items.
Compound stems can consist of a combination of noun and verb roots. The resulting
patterns are: N+N, N+V (§4.4.1). Much less frequent is the pattern V+V (§4.4.2). There
are also compound interrogative words which consist of nouns plus adpositions: N+AD
(§4.4.3).
4.4.1. Compound nouns
Compound nouns can consist of two nouns (16a-b), or a noun plus a verb (16cd). Each noun can stand on its own —i.e., have its own stress. However, combined they
operate as a single lexical unit. They exhibit a single stress which follows the pattern of
the language and occurs in the penultimate syllable, except when the word ends in a
nasal consonant (16c). In the following examples the underline portions carry stress.
(15)a. yakɨ + tsa
head leafyakɨtsa„hair‟b. pua + taɨra
hand sonpuataɨra„fingers‟c. ɨkɨ + tsen
chili + be.sweetɨkɨtsen„pepper‟d. ɨna + pewa
guava + be.flatɨnapewa„shimbillo (Inga sp.)‟1554.4.2. Compound verbs
In KK, compound verbs are not as common as compound nouns. In the few
examples with V+V pattern, it is difficult to identify which verb determines the primary
semantics and also the argument structure. The meaning of the compounds in (20) is the
sum of both elements.

A clitic is a grammatically independent but phonologically dependentmorpheme. In descriptive works, the term “clitic” is often used to refer to any element
whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix;
thus, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between the two.
Prototypical affixes morpho-syntactically and phonologically attach to a stem of a
limited part of speech. In contrast, clitics are categorically unrestricted morphemes. In
this study, clitics are characterized as lacking prosodic independence as opposed to
particles, which can occur on their own.
Perhaps one of the most salient features of KK is the use of clitics to express an
important number of grammatical categories. For instance, the language exhibits three157sets of pronominal forms: long form free pronouns, short form free pronouns and clitics.
The distribution of these forms in natural discourse is driven by pragmatic factors (for a
discussion on the distribution of pronominal forms in discourse, see Chapter XI). The
paradigm of clitic pronouns for female speech (FS) and male speech (MS) is presented
in Table 4.3, below. (For the complete paradigm of pronouns and a detailed discussion
on their functions see Chapter V, §5.3)

As pointed out earlier, in KK several grammatical categories are expressed viaclitics. Some of them are tense, modality, interrogation, and plurality. In terms of
distribution, clitics can be divided into three different types: phrasal clitics, second
position clitics, and less-fixed clitics. Particles —morphologically and phonologically
independent— are discussed in their own section (§4.6).
4.5.1. Phrasal clitics
Clitics that fall under this category are affixed to phrases rather than to words.
That is, they syntactically function above the word level, but attach phonetically to the
first, last, or only word in the phrase, regardless of the part of speech the word belongs
to. The grammatical categories expressed through phrasal clitics include plural, tense,
modality, oblique postpositions. In what follows I give examples of each category. Note
that plural is introduced only in this chapter. As for the other categories, here I give159some examples but describe them more extensively in other places of this dissertation.
Tense and modality are discussed in Chapter IX, §9.1.2 and §9.1.3, respectively;
postpositional phrases are the topic of Chapter VI.
4.5.1.1. Plural
As introduced above, KK grammar displays some female speech vs. male
speech distinctions, one of them being differential number marking. Singular is the
unmarked category, whereas plural is marked differently depending on whether the
speaker is a man or a woman. While men use the enclitic =kana (22), women use the
form =nu (23). In terms of distribution, plural is conveyed via noun phrase particles that
appear appended to the last word of an NP, which is a noun or a nominalized verb.
Within their host, the plural marker closes the word occupying a slot position after the
transcategorial and the evaluative morphemes.

tsaipura „drink‟ which is marked by the completive aspect -pa and then nominalized by
-n.","[184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"Predicate locative constructions
The predication of location of entities is primarily conveyed by means ofpostpositional phrases (§8.3) and relational nouns (§8.3.2).
8.3.1. [NP PP] & [PP NP]
Locative constructions are formed by simply juxtaposing a noun phrase and a
postpositional phrase predicate. Both orderings are attested: [NP PP] and [PP NP], with
the former the most frequent pattern.
As described in Chapter 6, KK has a number of directional and non-directional
postpositions, including: =ka „in, to (LOC),‟ =kuara „inside (INE),‟ =ri/ra „around
(DIF),‟ =tsui „ablative (ABL),‟ =rupe „up to there (FIN),‟ etc. The first three, which
convey static location, operate within predicate locative constructions. This is illustrated
in (51) to (53).

To form a negative locative construction, one adds the particle tɨma right before
the subject. The scope of tɨma can be the subject, or the whole construction. That is, the456propositional meaning could be: [NO X is at Y] or [X is NOT at Y], which have
different implications, as shown in the contexts provided by my consultants (55a-b).
Note, however, that when the locative predicate is fronted, only one interpretation is
possible (55c).
(55)a. tɨma
ɨrara pe=ka

It needs to be pointed out that in the database for this dissertation, no instancesof locative construction marked by tense have been attested. When speakers are asked
to add tense clitics, they first add the verb yuti „stay‟ which turns the construction into a
verbal predicate. We can also find yuti working as an auxiliary in several verbal
constructions (see §7.3.2). In locative constructions, yuti is working as the main verb, so
the tense clitics attach to it. As will be shown below, the locative noun phrase can go at
the end (56a) or at the beginning (56b) of the sentence.

And of course yuti can also be included in locative predicates in present tense.
The difference between non-verbal locative predicates and yuti-clauses is that the
former —(51) to (57)— indicate that an entity is in a particular location without making
any reference to time; whereas the latter entails that an entity remains in that location
(58) for a long period of time, or even permanently.

In locative predicate constructions, second position modal particles behave no
differently than in other types of constructions. They appear after the first element of
the constructions. Interestingly, in the database all the examples have the postpositional
phrase fronted, with the modal attached to it (59a-c). Schematically: [PP=MOD NP].
However, in elicitation, consultants can reverse the order and attach a modal to the
subject (59d).

8.3.2. [NP [N Nrelational]] & [[N Nrelational] NP]
As described in §6.3, KK has a set of relational nouns. Rather than describing
the attributes of an entity, a relational noun indicates the location of one entity with
respect to another. In the language they convey mainly location and, sporadically,
direction of movement, just like other postpositions. The relational nouns attested in KK
are listed in Chapter 6, Table 6.1.
Similar to a postposition, a relational noun can follow the noun which is the
point of reference: [N Nrelational]. Just like in locative predicates, one entity which is
located with reference to another via relational nouns can appear either fronted or
following the predicate. The resulting locative predicates can be summarized as: [NP [N
Nrelational]], or [[N Nrelational] NP]. These patterns are given in the elicited examples in
(60).
(60)a. [yawara

*„The dog is behind the man‟
b. napitsara [yawara
tsapakɨrɨ ]
man
dog
behind
„The man is behind the dog‟
* „The dog is behind the man‟459Note that when the subject follows the predicate, as in (60a), the relational noun
simply appears between two nouns; however, in (60b) the subject is in front of the
locative phrase. Recall that in KK two nouns in sequence tend to be interpreted as
bearing a genitive relationship; however, this interpretation in (60b) —*the man‟s dog
is behind — is not likely because the relational noun requires an argument (i.e., behind
what?). In natural discourse, speakers have a tendency to attach the relational noun to
the referent noun so that the referent of the location is always clear. This is shown in
(61).

example (61b) with its existential counterpart given in (62).

Another type of element that can be interrogated is particles, such as the
aspectual ay „already‟, and the negative marker tɨma. For instance, (106a), illustrates the
interrogation of the aspectual particle ay „already‟. Note that the particle appears
fronted, and what follows is a regular clause. That is: [PRT=tipa SUBJ V=T]. The text
example in (107a) is interesting because there is only a pronoun following the
morpheme =tipa. This pronoun is understood as the theme. Note that the form of the
pronoun is that of an object, as demonstrated by the elicited example in (107b), which
gives the corresponding male speech expression.","[567, 568]"

Notions such as source and location which are sometimes expressed through

For the sake of completeness, I mention here two discourse morphemes, =pura
and =nan, which occur primarily NPs (headed by either nouns or pronouns). More
precisely, these morphemes can occur with various parts of speech, including verbs,
negative particles and aspectual particles. The distribution of these clitics in the noun
word is not identical. The morpheme =pura „focus‟ shows up between derivational and
inflectional morphemes (153a), whereas the restrictive morpheme =nan „only‟ appears
at the end of the word, even after the postpositions (154a-b).

The distribution and functions of these morphemes are more fully described in

in detail elsewhere (Vallejos 2009).","[303, 304, 305, 306]"
"80transcriptions to the correct place in the audio file. It is especially helpful for
segmenting long duration recordings. Besides transcription, it also allows labeling
speech turns, overlapping speech, topic changes, language in use, etc. The negative side
of Transcriber is that it cannot use special symbols; however, if there is a need for
special symbols, one can use capital letters, a combination of small letters, etc. which
can be easily replaced by the corresponding special symbol later in the process. For
instance, the KK alphabet includes the letter „ɨ’ to represent the high-central vowel. In
Transcriber, I use a capital „I‟ for this vowel, and later replace it with its corresponding
Unicode symbol.
To preserve the timing of each transcription with the audio of intonation unit,
before I processed the transcribed files in Toolbox, I ran them through the Econv
application. Econv converts files created with Transcriber (TRS files) into plain text
files (TXT files). As mentioned above, this process retains the connections between the
analyzed texts and the original audio and video recording. It is also possible to import
TRS files directly into ELAN; however the timing information would be lost, and the
time-alignment must then be done by hand.
For translating (into Spanish), glossing and annotating the texts we used
Toolbox, a freely available linguistic program. In addition to facilitating a faster and
more reliable segmentation of morphology, it provides a filtering feature and search
options to make it possible to explore how grammatical forms are used in specific
contexts in large bodies of data. These features are extremely useful to the researcher
seeking to base an investigation and description of the grammar of a language on the81largest, most representative sample possible. For instance, the Toolbox database has
been key during the writing of this dissertation. To this point, each analyzed text
includes five lines or fields: the first line is the transcription of the text using the
orthography of the language. The second line contains the parsed morphemes. The third
line gives Spanish glosses. The fourth line shows the English glosses. The fifth line
presents the free translation in Spanish. So far, a sixth line that offers the free translation
in English has been included for only some texts (See Appendix C).
Next, the analyzed data generated by Toolbox (TXT files) are run once again
through Econv to convert the TXT files into EUDICO files. This process allows the
association of each video with their correspondent audio, transcription, and analysis
using the ELAN program. That is, ELAN integrates the video, audio and annotations in
the main document window. It allows waveform visualization of sound files and
interactive navigation through the associated files in a single window. Figure 2.3
illustrates how the integrated files look.
As might be obvious at this point, processing the data is a long process; as one
might expect, working with video is extremely time-consuming. At this point in the
project, we have processed about 15% of the clips; that is, a significant amount of the
extant data remains to be processed and transcribed.","[109, 110, 111]"
"4649.1. Simple verbal clause construction
In KK, the most basic verbal construction consists of a subject (full lexical NP or
pronoun) and an intransitive verb. However, a number of other elements can also occur
within declarative clauses. Two of the most important grammatical categories that can
potentially occur in declarative sentences are tense and modality. Additional,
complementary information is expressed by means of postpositional phrases, and
adverbs of manner, location and tense (see Chapter XI). Frequent clause-level particles
include focus markers and intensifiers (see Chapter IV). In Figure 9.1 I put these
categories together in order to offer an overall look at their distribution in the clause.

=míaI want to highlight that Figure 9.1 represents the most frequent, pragmatically
unmarked structure, though many others are possible, as will be showed in §9.1.1.
Tense clitics have been mentioned in several places already. Here we focus on their
functional semantics (§9.1.1.3). An additional point I would like to draw some
attention to is the fact that the language has two sets of morphemes that indicate
modality. The first set (MOD1) are second position clitics, as such they attach to
whichever element occurs sentence initially. In Figure 9.1, ADV appears in first
position, so MOD1 attaches to it; however, any other first position element would serve465equally well as the host of MOD1. The second set (MOD2) consists of two verb phrase
enclitics. Both sets of modality markers are discussed in (§9.1.2). It should be also
noted that adverbs and oblique phrases are not restricted to appear one per clause, nor
are they restricted to the syntactic positions indicated in Figure 9.1. For instance,
postpositional phrases often appear fronted in the clause. As for adverbs, they appear in
several other positions, including at the end of the clause, or right after the verb phrase.
9.1.1. Constituent order
The pragmatically unmarked clause displays SVO order. As discussed in
Chapter VI, circumstantial information (CI), if any, occurs in peripheral positions by
means of postpositional phrases and/or adverbial elements. In simple clause
constructions, explicit arguments are required in order to have well-formed clauses. In
only a few complex constructions, such as complement clauses, can equi-subjects be
left out of the clause (see Chapter X, §10.2 for more details). Thus, the structure of an
unmarked clause could be roughly summarized as: (CI) S V (O) (CI). Importantly,
circumstantial information does not occur between SV or VO (Vallejos, 2010).
Despite the strong supremacy of the SVO pattern in discourse, the language
allows several other orders of subject, object and verb depending on the marking of
progressive aspect marking. That is, different ordering patterns correlate with tense and
progressive aspect. Explanatory factors need to be taken into consideration to account
for the distribution of the set of available patterns in the language. The pragmatic forces
that trigger the use of a particular order instead of another are discussed in §11.4 and
§11.5.","[493, 494, 495]"

gender for first person singular, third person singular, first person plural exclusive, and
third person plural. The use of the correct set of pronouns signals whether someone is a42good speaker or not; it also indicates whether someone is in the process of learning the
language. Community members are ready to laugh at people —especially men— if
he/she uses the incorrect set.
This doesn‟t mean, of course, that men never use the female speech forms. For
instance, spontaneous speech is full of direct quotations, and if speakers are quoting
someone from the opposite gender, they have to switch to the appropriate set of forms.
The following fragment from a traditional story illustrates this. The speaker telling the
narrative is a man, who at a certain point —the last utterance in this extract— quotes a
woman. During the narrative the speaker consistently uses male speech forms, and for
the quote he switches to female speech forms, including the demonstrative ajan (instead
of ikian) and the first person pronoun etse (instead of ta). Immediately after the quote,
the speaker goes back to the male form (ra „third singular‟). The relevant pieces are in
bold.

of the language. Interestingly, this type of gender-based distinction is also found in
other language considered Tupí-Guaraní outsider, such as Aweti (Drude, 2002). In
Awetí, for instance, the distinctions show up in the paradigm of pronouns, prefixes,
deictics and lexicon. This topic clearly deserves further, comparative research.
1.5.2. Constituent orderings
The language does not display case marking or verb agreement to express
grammatical relations; instead, subject and object are defined by their position with
respect to the verb. Verbal clauses display different orders of subject, object and verb
depending on whether they are marked by tense or the progressive aspect (see Chapter
XIX). Importantly, clauses not marked for tense-aspect pattern with clauses marked by
tense, differently from constructions marked by the progressive. Table 1.5 presents a
summary of constituent order patterns attested in the language, where, S, A, and O refer
to subject of intransitive, subject of transitive, and object of transitive, respectively
(Dixon 1979); subscript T stands for a tense clitic, and subscript P for the progressive
verbal suffix.

A VP OStarting with Greenberg (1963), there has been an assumption in linguistics that
for a majority of languages it is possible to identify a “basic” order of subject and object44with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Dryer 1992, among others). This has constituted
a way of categorizing languages in typology. However, what is basic in terms of order
and how to identify it remains debatable. As a consequence, some scholars have
suggested that the first typological division should be made between those languages in
which word order primarily correlates with pragmatic factors, and those in which order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors (Thompson 1978). Thus, in languages
which display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, it should
be asked “what is the communicative function of one order, rather than another” (Payne
1990, 1992). In order to answer this question, explanatory factors beyond syntax, such as
information structure and pragmatics, must be taken into consideration. The case of
Kokama-Kokamilla is interesting because both grammatical relations and pragmatics play
a prominent role in the distribution of the different order patterns.
1.5.3. The syntax-discourse interface
KK highlights points of theoretical interest regarding discourse-pragmatic issues.
The language displays interesting patterns of interaction between information structure
and syntax. Although word order is perhaps one of the main strategies for expressing
discourse-pragmatic factors, there are several other components playing a role within
specific constructions. For instance, tense-marked clauses, aspect-marked clauses, and
clauses unmarked for tense and aspect have a skewed distribution in discourse, and the
driving factor is the background/foreground narrative distinction (Vallejos 2007). Another
issue concerns the distribution of pronominal forms. The language exhibits three sets of
pronominal forms: free long form pronouns, short form free pronouns, and enclitics. The45choice between these forms is iconically motivated: short form pronouns occur by default,
typically refering to information which is low in salience; clitics are the further reductions
of short forms, used to refer to recurring participants in core grammatical relations; long
forms are used for highlighting certain aspects of a complex experience, and to attract the
hearer‟s attention to one part of a sentence (Vallejos 2005). Further, informationstructural distinctions, such as argument focus, predicate focus and predication focus, are
signaled by the interaction of word order, morphological markers, and prosody (Vallejos
2009). Topics dealing with the syntax-discourse interface are discussed in Chapter XI.
Now that the major features of the language have been highlighted, I turn the
discussion to the theoretical orientation and descriptive notions employed to describe
the language.
1.6. Theoretical framework
This section starts with an introduction to the Functional-Typological approach to
language study, which is the theoretical perspective this dissertation follows (§0). I also
present the basic notions of Construction Grammar, which prove relevant to the
description of KK (§1.6.2). A literature review of grammatical relations is offered
towards the end of this section (§1.6.3). Other theoretical notions necessary to describe
specific aspects of KK are introduced at relevant points throughout the dissertation.
1.6.1. The functional-typological approach to language
The Functional-Typological approach treats language in terms of both its
adaptive motivation —i.e., as a tool for conceptualization and communication between
human beings— and its typological diversity —i.e., recurrent cross-linguistic patterns.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"
"736Thus, the pattern OSV is the result of focalizing O when it encodes pragmatically
salient information. These results are consistent with what has been found in other areas
of the grammar, such as focus constructions.
Another finding of the frequency study is that the progressive-marked patterns
— VS and SOV — are extremely rare in spontaneous speech. In the next section we
turn the discussion to those patterns, and explore the function of progressive-marked
constructions by contrasting them with tense-marked constructions.
11.5. The function of tense/aspect marked clauses in discourse
In several places in this dissertation, I have stated that there is a relationship
between tense, aspect, and constituent order (see§11.4.1). In section, §11.4, the
productivity of the various ordering patterns available in the language was examined.
One of the findings is that progressive-marked patterns appear very rarely (about 3% of
declarative sentences). However, because tense-marked clauses pattern like unmarked
clauses, those results tell nothing about the productivity of tense-marked clauses.
So, two questions arise: i) How often do speakers employ tense-marked clauses,
progressive-marked clauses, and unmarked clauses? ii) What drives the distribution of
tense-marked clauses and progressive-marked clauses? This section addresses those
questions by exploring whether or not all, of any of those patterns can be associated
with particular discourse functions.
11.5.1. Background and foreground in discourse
A crucial finding regarding the structure of the discourse is that languages codify in
different ways the main events of a story, i.e., foreground information, as opposed to737supportive material, i.e., background information (Hopper 1979). Empirical studies
have shown that this observation is especially relevant for the study of narratives; that
is, those types of discourses that are basically monologues. Some of the defining
features of these two types of information are summarized in Table 11.8.
Table 11.8: Background vs. foreground (Hopper 1979, Longacre 1996)
ForegroundBackground refers to dynamic and active events,
punctual verbs often in perfective aspect
 high level of assertion durative, stative, iterative verbs, often in
imperfective aspect
 low level of assertion (modals) events happen in sequences, contingent on
the completion of prior events does not happen in sequences, may be
located at any point along the time axis, or
not located at all
 add supportive material, complementary
information, comment on main events constitutes the main storyline
 new material in the storyline is introduced
in the predicate (verb plus complement) likelihood of topic changes, introduction of
new information in the subject positionHopper suggests that the foreground/background distinction is a universal of
narrative discourse (1979:213), and it is encoded by means of several strategies. A
number of studies seem to confirm this hypothesis. For instance, some of the attested
strategies are voice (Malay), word order (old English), and tense/aspect (Swahili,
French), among others.
Although the foreground/background distinction is valid in at least narrative, it
is perhaps somehow too general. For instance, some studies have found that within the
foreground category, languages may make a distinction between unexpected/crucial
events and routine/predictable events; others distinguish the events that constitute the
climax from the ones that do not. In Yagua, for instance, there are two types of
foreground: ordinary main event line versus peak (Payne 1992). In Godie there are three738types of foreground information: crucial events, sequential events, and concluded events
(Marchese 1988). That is, languages have multiple ways of organizing even the
foreground half of discourse.
Further, even though the relevance of the foreground/background distinction in
narratives seems undeniable, it is not clear that this distinction is applicable to other
types of discourse, especially those that involve more than one speaker, such as
spontaneous conversations. As Longacre (1996) points out, before this type of analysis
is extended to other types of discourse it is perhaps necessary to set up some parameters
to classify them into different genres; this may make it possible to have comparable
results.17
In §11.5.2, we evaluate the significance of the foreground/background distinction
to explain the distribution of progressive-marked clauses and tense-marked clauses in
KK discourse.
11.5.2. Data and findings
This particular discourse study examines twenty-one short texts (2546
intonational units in total), collected from eleven speakers. The variables considered in
the selection of the sample were the following:
Gender of the speaker: This variable is relevant for KK since the language
displays several distinctions according to the speaker‟s gender. The texts come
from four women and five men.","[765, 766, 767, 768]"

"Introduction to Morphology
CHAPTER IV
INTRODUCTION TO MORPHOLOGY
This chapter provides an overview of the morphological units and processesavailable in KK. It provides the necessary operational definitions and background for
the discussion presented in the upcoming chapters. The grammatical categories
expressed through the mechanisms outlined in this chapter are treated in more detail in
subsequent chapters.
From a typological perspective, KK can be characterized as an isolating language
because words tend to be comprised of one morpheme, and morphemes can be
identified with particular meanings. As such, bare nominals and nominal modifiers are
common. Because of reanalysis and grammaticalization processes, there are also a few
instances were morpheme boundaries are not clear. On the other hand, considering that
KK uses order of constituents, specific grammatical words, and particles, rather than
inflection to express syntactic relations within sentences, it can also be characterized as
analytical.",[172]
"648The forms under discussion are presented in Table 10.6. The last two columns
provide information about the level of operation of each form.

Table 10.6.
i)All of them exhibit the male-speech (MS) versus female-speech (FS)
opposition.ii)Synchronically, some of them, but not all, can be further analyzed into
smaller pieces (indicated by hyphens in the table).iii)Even the constructions that cannot be analyzed further involve
phonological pieces (ria, rae,) which strongly resemble pronominal
forms for third person male-speech (ra, uri, =ura). More importantly,
this is also true for the set of female-speech forms, which include forms
(iya/yae) that also bear a resemblance to third person female-speech
pronominals (ya, ay).iv)In addition to the third-person-like element, these constructions involve
adverbial subordinators (i.e., -ikua „reason‟, -npu „later‟), postpositions649(i.e., =tsui „ablative‟, =ka, „locative), as well as the nominalizer -n, and
the marker of restrictive focus =nan.
In what follows I discuss the form and function of each of these conjunctions,
beginning with those that have double functions.
10.5.2.1 . Coupling: riay/yay ‘also/and’
In KK, two clauses can be conjoined by adding the particle riay/yay between the
two. This is illustrated in (113). In (113a), both the subject and the verb are identical, so
they can be omitted in the second clause. Speakers say that omitting the verb in (113b)
could result in an odd sentence. The reason for this is that if the verb is omitted, the
tense marker would have to attach to the pronominal subject, and that pattern is not
allowed in the language.

clause, as in (114a). Note that, since in (113c) and (114a) riay links same events, the
proposition is equivalent to the simple clause in (114b), in which both subjects are
replaced by a plural pronoun.","[677, 678, 679]"
"Note that in connected speech speakers tend to attach the relational noun to the referent
noun (57b). However, when speakers are asked to repeat a sentence, for instance, they
usually produce the relational nouns unbounded. This is not the case with postpositions,
which always appear bounded. It was found that the relational nouns that frequently
attach to the referent noun are the ones that consist of two-syllables (e.g., such as wɨrɨ
„underneath of,‟ or tsɨma „edge of‟), unless there is additional morphology, such as
focus, as in (58e).

Beyond the function and syntactic distribution illustrated above, each relationalnoun displays particular behavior and collocational preferences. For instance, tsɨma
„edge‟ very often appears with nouns like river, lake, and creek. In some of those
instances, tsɨma takes the postposition =ri/ra „around‟ if the clause includes a dynamic
predicate and gets interpreted as „along the edge of” (see 61a-b). However, in clauses314with non-dynamic predicates, tsɨma can take =ka „in‟ which gets interpreted as „at the
edge/shore of,‟ as shown in (61c).

The relational noun tsapɨta „base of,‟ has been also attested with the diffuse
locative =ri (62b). In one instance it combines with the inessive =kuara and this is
possible because the entity that hides „within the base of the banana tree‟ is a spirit.

to the other members of the set. For example, in highly contextualized instances, it can
315appear by itself, without its locative referent. See, for instance, (63a) where it is clear by
the context that it refers to „the shore of the river,‟ however only shore is made explicit.
In addition, in the database there are two instances in which tsɨma appears bearing the
instrument postposition. These particular sentences talk about a turtle that is working
using the edge of its shell (63b).

Another relational noun that shows idiosyncrasies is mɨtɨrɨ „middle of.‟ It cantake the old locative postposition -pe (from the *Tupi-Guaraní -pe), which is no longer
productive with other nouns (64a). Interestingly, this sequence can be nominalized by -n
to take the postposition =kuara „inessive‟ (64b). However, this particular combination is
very idiosyncratic, in the sense that it is the only postposition it can take.

As indicated above, the main function of relational nouns is to locate an entity in
space. However, when they modify words such as kuashi „day‟ or kuarachi „sun‟ they
indicate temporal location.

Two relational nouns, tsapakɨrɨ „behind of‟ and arɨwa „above of‟ can act as
temporal adverbs. That is, if they do not operate as a modifiers of a noun or a noun317phrase, they are interpreted as „after‟ and „while‟, respectively (see §6.4.3). The role of
relational nouns in locative predicates is explored in Chapter VIII.
Up to here we can conclude that KK employs postpositions and relational nouns
to indicate several oblique functions within the clause. Postpositions attach to the eightedge of the noun phrase, whereas relational nouns follow the noun phrase. While
postposition must occur cliticized to the NP, relational nouns can optionally attach to
the NP. The following section focuses on adverbs, which is the third strategy to add
circumstantial information to the clause.
6.4. Adverbial words
Adverbial elements modify the predicate or a larger syntactic unit which
includes the predicate. While adverb as a word class is convenient analytically, it still
requires further work before suitable criteria for characterizing it as a set can be clearly
identified. In addition to placement in the clause, prototypical adverbial elements share
the following features:
a) Unlike verbs,
they cannot be the main predicate of the clausethey cannot be nominalized by -n to operate in attributive predicationthey do not take any morphology associated with verbs, such as
aspectual markers and valence changing devices.b) Unlike nouns,
they cannot be the head of a noun phrase318they do not take morphology associated with nouns and noun phrases,
such as diminutive, affective, plurals, etc.c) Unlike any other grammatical unit,
they cannot be focalized by =pura, the focus particle that can be
attached to almost any type of host, including nouns, verbs, negative
particles, discourse particles, etc.d) Positive features that identify adverbs include:
most adverbs can be focalized by the restrictive morpheme -nan
„only.‟ In fact, -nan seems to be part of the phonological form of some
adverbs.","[342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348]"
"67611.1.3. Prosody: focal stress, lexical stress and intonation contours
Throughout this chapter, the term intonation will be associated with speech acts
(declarative, imperative, interrogative, etc.), word stress with lexical items (as assigned
by phonological rules), and focal stress (or prosodic peak, sentence accent) with
utterances. Focal stress is driven by information structure (focus, activation, etc.), and
is said to coincide with, or override, lexical stress (Lambrecht 1994:240).
As explained in Chapter III (§3.3), in KK word stress has a delimitative
function, occurring on the penultimate syllable of the word, unless the word ends in a
consonant in which case it occurs on the final syllable. In terms of intonation, certain
contours are associated with pragmatically unmarked declarative sentences: a slightly
homogeneous volume plus decline in both at the end of intonation units. However, focal
stress—characterized as raising pitch (F0) and volume, plus optional lengthening of
vocalic segments — proves more relevant for this paper. For the remainder of this
chapter, when I use the term stress, I intend it to refer only to focal stress.
Unmarked focus constructions do not exhibit a strong focal stress in any
constituent. In the language, focal stress can be characterized as raising pitch (F0) &
volume, and, optionally, lengthening vocalic segments. Also, certain intonation
contours can be associated with unmarked structures: slightly homogeneous pitch level
and volume plus decline at the end of intonation units. Consider examples (2a-c) and
the associated pitch contours in Figures 11.1-3.

Across languages, it is common to find a strong correlation between focal stress
and focus. For instance, in KK, while the pitch contours for (2a) are relatively uniform
(see Figure 11.1, in (2b) and (2c), there is a peak on the element in focus, „(the city of)
Lima‟ in (2b/ Figure 11.2), and „all (kinds of things)‟ in (2c/Figure 11.3). This
observation can be generalized for any element in focus, whether they are arguments,
predicates, or adverbials: if an element is in focus, it generally coincides with the
prosodic peak within the clause.
However, high pitch does not necessarily coincide with narrow focus — we will
see that the focus domain could be elsewhere within the clause. These correlations are
further explored in §11.2 when discussing the interactions among =pura, constituent
order, and stress to express broad focus.
11.2. Focus constructions that involve =pura
This section examines the functional nuances of =pura, a focus marker. This
morpheme is best analyzed as a clitic because it exhibits very few restrictions with
respect to its phonological host, and lacks a fixed position in the sentence. The marked
element may be a noun phrase (NP) in subject, object, or oblique functions, a verb, a679dependent clause, a particle, and, most interestingly, =pura can focalize individual
elements within more complex syntactic units, such as an argument of a dependent
clause. In terms of pragmatics, =pura can potentially participate in various subtypes of
narrow-focus constructions, but also in broad-focus constructions. To fully account for
the function of =pura we need to include prosody and constituent order in the
discussion, as the interaction among these is relevant for expressing focus in KK. That
is, =pura cannot be associated by itself with specific subtypes of focus because it is the
larger constructions involving =pura that have either a narrow/broad or contrastive/noncontrastive interpretation. Overall, this paper shows that although the appearance of
=pura is pragmatically motivated, its distribution can be grammatically described.
Section 11.2.1 introduces the problem, and the data for this particular study.
Section 11.2.2 presents an overview of the multiple focus constructions in which =pura
is involved, section 11.2.3 discusses narrow-focus constructions, section 11.2.4
examines broad-focus constructions, and section 11.2.5 draws the conclusions of this
study.
11.2.1. The problem and the data
The clitic =pura2 combines with a wide range of stems and lacks a fixed position in
the sentence. In previous studies of KK, the morpheme =pura is barely mentioned. It
has only been reported as either “the emphatic particle which attaches to nominalized
sentences to indicate something that is definitely completed or has already happened”
2The etymology of =pura is uncertain. Two hypotheses can be entertained: the verb purara „find‟ and the
Spanish adjective puro/a „authentic, unadulterated‟. Both need further examination, which is beyond the
scope of this paper.","[705, 706, 707, 708, 709]"
"674It is in the area of narrow plus contrastive focus where the typologies under
discussion differ the most. While Watters (1979) suggests two subtypes, Dik et al.
(1981) propose five subtypes. Watters proposes counter-assertive focus (“information
the speaker substitutes for a previous utterance asserted by the hearer”, e.g. Inah gave
FUFU to his friends {not yams}) and exhaustive listing focus (“the sentence is true
only with respect to this piece of information, and false with respect to other possible
alternatives”, e.g. Inah gave FUFU ONLY to his friends). Dik et al. identify these same
subtypes, calling the former replacing focus (i.e. a specific item in the pragmatic
information of the hearer is removed and replaced by another correct item), and the
latter restrictive focus (i.e. the presupposed set is restricted to one or more values).
However, Dik et al. (1981) specify that these subtypes should be characterized as
counter-presuppositional rather than counter-asserted because, according to them, what
matters is not what the hearer said, but the speaker's assumptions about the hearer‟s
pragmatic information at the time of the utterance. In addition, Dik et al.‟s typology
distinguishes the following subtypes: selective focus (selecting an item from a set of
presupposed possibilities, e.g. Did John buy coffee or rice? John bought RICE),
expanding focus (adding information to the antecedently presupposed information, e.g.
John bought rice. Yes, but he also bought COFFEE), and parallel focus (two pieces of
information are contrasted within one linguistic unit, e.g. JOHN bought RICE, but
PETER bought COFFEE).
Broad focus refers to constructions where the focus domain includes more than a
single constituent. If the focus domain is the whole sentence and it has non-contrastive675interpretation, Dik et al. calls it predication focus, and Watters polar focus. Watters‟
polar focus occurs when “the truth value „true‟ or „false‟ is asserted or counter-asserted”
(e.g. Inah DID give fufu to his friends). For Lambrecht, if the focus domain includes all
but the subject, this is predicate focus (recall that for him this is the pragmatically
unmarked focus construction); however, if it includes the whole sentence, this is
sentence focus (e.g. What happened? My CAR broke down.) Finally, Watters also
distinguishes sentence focus constructions with contrastive interpretation. He refers to
the latter as counter-assertive polar focus defined as “the speaker‟s reply contradicting
the hearer‟s assertion about the truth value „true‟ or „false‟ of the sentence” (e.g. Inah
DID TOO give FUFU to his friends). While for Lambrecht, counter-assertive polar
focus may be a potential subtype of focus, Dik et al. refers to both Watters‟ asserted and
counter-asserted polar focus as predication focus.
The grammar of KK provides an opportunity to test the distinctions between the
typologies presented above. The morpheme =pura is mainly concerned with
information structure; it guides the hearer about how particular sentences, and pieces of
sentences, relate to the overall discourse. Examining the uses of =pura turns out to take
us well beyond the morpheme itself, to a set of constructions involving the interaction
of =pura with other morphemes, constituent order and stress. On the one hand, KK
appears to lack grammar devoted to coding several of the distinctions suggested by Dik
et al.; on the other hand, KK has a distinct construction dedicated to coding narrow
focus contrast, which appears to force Lambrecht‟s model to acknowledge the relevance
of that category in theories of the grammar of focus.","[703, 704, 705]"
"143Bybee (1985) categorizes the morphological strategies for combining semantic
units into five categories: lexical (e.g., drop = fall plus cause), derivational (e.g., dropper), inflectional (e.g., dropp-ed), free grammatical (e.g., may), and syntactic/periphrastic
(come to know = know plus inchoative). The above five strategies are characterized by
different morphosyntactic cohesion.
The lexical strategy is characterized by the highest degree of fusion. Both
semantic elements (fall and cause) are expressed within one single unanalysable
morpheme. The lowest degree of fusion is found in the syntactic strategy (juxtaposition
of two words). The other three strategies are situated between these two poles within the
following continuum:
Figure 4.1: Morphological strategies and degrees of fusion (Bybee 1985:12)
lexical

inflectional free-grammatical
syntactic
<—————————————————————————————————
The strategies to combine morphemes in KK show different degrees of
morphosyntactic cohesion. They range from inflectional and derivational affixes
(highest cohesion) to clitics and free particles (lowest cohesion). However, the language
has a few suffixes, but none of them obligatorily accompanies roots or stems when they
occur in a finite clause. One of the salient features of the language is the existence of a

a rich morphology compared to other Amazonian languages; in contrast, it does have an

„We will reach again the people who are crossing (the street)
A first attempt to formulate the structure of these NPs would be: NP = [N=pura
RC=pura]. Notice, however, that each element can also be marked by plural (23b). Also,
there is stress on each pura-marked piece, but there is no pause between them. This
suggests that in constructions like (23) the head and the RC are each behaving as
independent syntactic units on their own. At the same time, they function together as
either the subject or object of the clause. Thus, a better interpretation of the complex
NPs in (23) is that they consist of two NPs in an appositive relationship. That is: NP =
[NP NP]. The appositive NPs have the same referent, which in the communicative
context happens to be in focus. In consequence, the examples in (23) are additional
cases of narrow focus.
With respect to the pragmatic structure of the above examples, constituent order is
crucial for the type of focus being coded. While (22a), (23a) and (23c) display canonical
order SV(O) and yield non-contrastive interpretations, (22b) and (23b) have noncanonical order OSV and bear contrastive interpretations. For instance, sentence (23a)
comes from a narrative about the yacurunas, and is produced when the speaker is700narrating that when she was at her farm, she heard people screaming. She points out that
at the beginning she did not know who was screaming. Then she realized that the ones
screaming were calling „her‟ and happened to be „they‟, her children. Since „they‟ and
„the scared ones‟ have the same referent and this is in focus, the speaker marks both
pieces with =pura. Example (23b) comes from the same narrative about the yacurunas.
Up to this point of the narrative, possible candidates for being called by the yacurunas
introduced by the speaker are her children and her neighbors. Here the speaker asserts
that these aquatic creatures where calling to „her children‟.
(23a‟) Presupposition: <X call>; assertion: <X=they, the scared ones>
(23b‟) Presupposition: <they call X>; assertion: <X=the children who stayed at home>
Set of alternatives: <children, neighbors, someone else>
Up to here we have seen that the scope of =pura is a NP usually in the O
argument function. Depending on the constituent order of the construction, the focus is
modifying what is perceived to be a wrong variable-instantiation, or filling a presumed
gap in the addressee‟s knowledge. Importantly, in KK narrow focus constructions, the
focused element correlates with the prosodic peak within the intonation unit. This
changes in the next section, which examines the different interaction between =pura
and stress used to encode broad focus.
11.2.4. =pura and broad focus
This section examines the contribution of =pura in broad focus constructions.
The construction for focusing the whole predication is a combination of two devices:
the morpheme =pura, and focal stress. In natural discourse, especially in narratives, big
chunks of oral material are produced with no pauses or interruptions. Those situations701call for strategies to mark information packaging. Crosslinguistic evidence indicates
that focal stress tends to be located towards the end of the focus constituent (Halliday
1967, Ladd 1978). Lambrecht (1994:247) specifies that a fundamental principle of
information structure is that “a sentence accent marks the END of a semantic domain,
whose BEGINNING is marked by non-prosodic means.” In contrast to accent, the
presence of particles, or clitics, with distinctive syntax or an especially heavy functional
load has been reported as a prominent feature for signaling information structure of
languages from lowland South America (see Dooley 1990, Derbyshire 1986, Wise
1986, Jensen 1982, among others). Dooley (1990) proposes the term spacer for particles
whose function is to signal divisions in the information structuring of the utterance. In
sentence focus constructions, =pura assumes this delimitative function.
11.2.4.1.=pura as a spacerIn sentence-focus constructions, the NP to which =pura attaches usually
functions as the subject (more likely S than A) of the main clause. In terms of encoding,
the constituent order is unmarked, =pura attaches to the subject NP, and the focal stress
occurs at the end of the verb phrase, usually the verb. The construction could be
summarized as: [S=pura V].
In examples (24-25), the portion under focus is the whole predication.

In the discourse preceding (24), the speaker is talking about illegal fishing, theability of the robbers, the incompetence of the guards, etc. In (24b), she introduces „the
government‟ and comments on it in the subsequent portion of the discourse. Note that
the propositional content of (24b) is not taken for granted or presupposed; that is, the
whole proposition is the focus of assertion. In the same vein, there is not a specific
presupposition for (25a-b). The context is the following: a woman avoids everybody‟s
company while working at the farm, including her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law
suspects the woman is hiding a secret and decides to spy on her. One day she follows
her daughter-in-law and when she arrives to the farm, the only thing she sees is a huge
turtle working. In this context, (25a) and (25b) are answering the question: and what
happens next? Examples like (24b) are often called “presentational sentences” and (25ab) “event-reporting sentences” or “thetic sentences.” The first type introduces a new
entity into the discourse, the second type an event. Both share the fact that the subject of
the sentence is not the topic11 of the discourse.","[729, 730, 731, 732]"
"265The types of nouns that in the database appear modified by numbers range
semantically from animate beings (napitsara „man‟, mɨmɨrakunia „woman‟s daughter‟,
irua „friend/brother‟, inia „type of fish‟) etc. to nouns with temporal interpretations such
as wata „year‟, ikuashi/kuashi „sun/day‟, yatsɨ „moon/month‟, or Spanish borrowings
such as semana „week‟, hora „hour‟, specialist „consultant‟, etc. Examples are presented

In the database, there are a number of non-verbal predicate constructions where
the numeral appears sentence initially, schematically: [Num NP]. In these cases,
however, the numeral receives a predicate-like interpretation, with the NP interpreted as
the subject. For instance, in (132a-b), the numerals pichka „five‟ and iruaka „four‟ are
the subjects of their respective constructions, whereas the NP „my children‟ and „its
tails‟ are the predicates. However, numerals are not attested assuming argument266functions in verbal predicate constructions. In (133), mukuika „two‟ behaves as an
appositive element; the subject of the clause is the pronopun inu „they.‟

In terms of their verbal features, numerals must be nominalized to combine withclitics associated with nouns and noun phrases, and to appear in other nominal syntactic
slots. Note in (134), that the numeral is nominalized via -n before being suffixed by the
diminutive, augmentative, affective, and plural clitics, which are morphemes restricted
to nouns.

CNJIn the other direction, numerals can take morphemes associated with verbs. In
elicitation, numerals can operate fully as predicates of the clause. The examples in (135)
were elicited from two speakers. In (135a), the numeral is suffixed by the completive
aspect -pa, in (135b) by the progressive marker -ri, and in (135c) by the causative
marker -ta. It should be pointed out, though, that one of the functions of the causative
morpheme is to derive new verbs from nouns, so (135c) alone is not strong evidence of
the verbal character of numerals.

In summary, while numerals are a part of speech category of their own, they also
display features of both nouns and verbs. Like nouns, they work as nominal determiners
within NPs. Yet they need to be nominalized to serve as the head on a NP. Like verbs,
they do not require derivational morphology to operate as predicates; also, they receive
morphology associated with verbs. So even though they are a unique category, their
formal behavior puts them towards the verbal side in the part-of-speech spectrum.
5.8.2. Non-numeral quantifiers
The language also has a set of non-numeral quantifiers at its disposal (137).

with accuracy. In eliciting context it acts as an emphatic. Here are two examples given by one of my
consultants. The context for (a) is this: a kid wants a fruit from a tree but he is afraid to climb the tree. So,
someone would say to him the utterance in (a).:The context for (b) is this: a kid has been gone for a

particles. Note that the restrictive =nan „only‟ reduces the quantity to which the base
form makes reference.

„no many/a few‟Non-numeral quantifiers display similar properties to numerals. They operate as
modifiers of the head noun within NPs, and need to be nominalized to act as nouns. In
what follows I provide examples that show the use of each quantifier, starting with the
most frequent ones in the database.
The word awɨrɨ conveys „considerable amount of X.‟ It can appear modifying
both count and non-count nouns. Interestingly, with uncountable entities it conveys
individuation-like meaning. For instance, when modifies „speech‟ it gets interpreted as
„many words,‟ when it appears with „time‟, it gets interpreted as „many turns,‟ and so
on.

many.‟ In the database, there are rhetorical questions in which awɨrɨ is used as
interrogative but entails „so many‟ (140). Interestingly, the Spanish interrogative
cuanto(s) is also commonly used as an indefinite quantifier in Amazonian Spanish.14

In contrast, the combination of awɨrɨ „many‟ and the restrictive morpheme =nan
„only‟ within the same NP conveys „just a few.‟ In this construction, the quantifier
precedes the head noun (141a-b) and =nan cliticizes to the head: [awɨrɨ X=nan].
However, the quantifier can be nominalized, and thereby become the head noun itself
(141c); again, this phenomenon seems parallel to the Spanish expression unos cuantos

"72911.4. The pragmatics of constituent order patterns
Starting with Greenberg (1963), there has been a fundamental assumption in
linguistics that for a majority of languages it is possible to identify a “basic” order of
subject and object with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Nichols 1986, Dryer 1988,
among others). This constitutes one way of categorizing languages in typology.
However, what is basic and how to identify it remains debatable. None of the
standard strategies to detect basic word order — statistical frequency, descriptive
simplicity, and pragmatic neutrality —is without problems. As a result, some scholars
have questioned the universality of the very notion of basic word order; when languages
display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, some scholars
advocate asking a different question, namely “what is the communicative function of
one order, rather than another” (Mithun 1992, Payne 1990, 1992). Thus, the first
typological division should be made between those languages in which word order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors, and those in which word order primarily
correlates with pragmatic factors (Thompson 1978).
The speakers of KK have several constituent order patterns at their disposal, and
this section explores the factors that speakers take into consideration when choosing one
of those patterns at the moment of the utterance. It was found that some patterns are
used to mark certain pieces of information as pragmatically salient. Here I use salient in
the sense of Mithun‟s (1993) newsworthy, for referring to unexpected information (i.e.
which breaks shared cultural knowledge and expectations), answers to information
questions, restatements, topic shifting, etc. In Givón‟s words, salient information would730be considered more informative than non/less-salient information. Informativeness can
be seen as a composite of several parameters: it correlates with new as opposed to
given, indefinite as opposed to definite, contrastive as opposed to non-contrastive. In
general, it involves less predictable information (Givon 1983).
11.4.1. Available ordering patterns
As discussed in Chapters IX, §9.1.1, in KK word order partially defines the
syntactic role of an argument. Although neither tense nor aspect morphology is required
as part of a basic clause, a clause allows a different order of subject, object and verb
depending on whether or not it is marked for progressive aspect. The available patterns
are listed in Table 11.6; for examples that illustrate these patterns, please see Chapter
VIII.15

possible if auxiliary verbs are added to the clause.","[758, 759, 760]"

Again, it is difficult to posit a single complex syntactic unit in (116).
Consequently, it becomes clear that the role of riay/yay is beyond the sentence level. As
indicated earlier, in terms of distribution, the pattern presented in (115) and (116) is the
most prominent function of riay/yay.
10.5.2.2 . Contrast: urian/iyan ‘but’ (FS)
Two clauses can be conjoined by means of urian/iyan to indicate some type of
semantic contrast between the two. As indicated by Longacre (2007:378), in contrast
relationships, “there must be at least two opposed pairs of lexical items.” It can be
expressed by positive and negative values of the same predicate (I went down, but she
didn’t), antonyms (I went down, but she stayed home), or exception (Grandfather didn’t
go to sleep, but everybody else did), among others.
The following are examples of disjunction in KK. In (117a), the contrast is
established between „die/kill‟ versus „escape‟. Example (117b) contrasts „gone‟ with
„left behind‟. Example (117c) involves a negative clause: „the bulb of chambira-palm
whitens‟ versus „the bulb of aguaje-palm does not‟.

Similarly to riay/yay „and/also‟, the adversative conjunction urian/iyan can play
a role beyond the sentence. However, compared to its sentence level function, the
intersentential function of urian/iyan is more rare. An example is presented in (118).
The propositions being contrasted are not in adjacent clauses. Here, the disjunction is
established between „(the one) who runs on the ground, they don‟t find‟ and „(the one)
who goes up the river, they find‟. However, the proposition „they don‟t find‟ is
expressed not in the clause that is right before the connector iyan, but in the previous
utterance.

Two additional examples that illustrate the discourse function of riay/yay are
presented in (119) and (120). In (119), the contrast is established between „live with
you‟ and „leave you‟. However, this is inferred from the sequence of utterances; that is,
it is not explicited in the two joined clauses themselves. Strictly speaking, in (120) iyan
does not join two clauses into a complex syntactic unit. In terms of prosody, for
instance, a semicolon at the end of the first line indicates a pause. In those contexts,
iyan adds to the cohesion of a stretch of discourse, rather than contrasting two adjacent
clauses, as it does in examples (117) and (118).

10.5.2.3 . Cause-result: rikua / yikua ‘that’s why’
The forms rikua/yikua consists of the third person singular clitic r/y and the
adverbial subordinator of cause -ikua. The forms rikua/yikua indicates that the previous
clause must be construed as the motivating factor for the event being introduced by
rikua/yikua. In other words, the pronominal form anaphorically refers back to the event
indicated in the preceding clause, „because of that‟. The examples in (121) show that a
cause/result relationship is established between adjacent clauses.

10.5.2.4 . Succession: rianpu/yanpu ‘after that, and then’
The form rianpu/yanpu appears to consist of the pieces ria/ya plus the adverbial
subordinator morpheme -npu „after‟. However, even though the element ria does show657up in another discourse level conjunction, ria-nan/ya-nan „just like that‟, it does not
exist as either an independent or bound morpheme related to third person.
There are only few instances in which it could be argued that the form
rianpu/yanpu joins two clauses into a single complex sentence. The only evidence for
this claim would be prosody, because no example with omitted repeated elements are
attested in the database. Recall that omission of identical elements is attested in clauses
with the conjunction riay/yay „and/also‟, and urian/iyan „but‟, discussed above. To
illustrate the absence of omission, consider the example in (124) where, although the
two clauses share the subject, ya/y= „he‟, the second subject is still explicitly stated.

In the majority of cases, rianpu/yanpu has an intersentential function. For
instance, the extract in (125) is organized into three intonation units; note that there is a
pause before rianpu. At the notional level, the events „get in‟, „tie him‟, „ hit him‟
constitute a coherent sequence, where the events before rianpu are presented as if they
need to take place first, before the event introduced by rianpu. In that sense, rianpu
flags the event that closes the sequence. A quite similar example is presented in (126).

Example (127) shows a slightly different function of rianpu/yanpu. Since there
is interaction between Speaker A and B, rianpu not only indicates temporal sequence,
but also seems to aid Speaker A to re-take the floor.

10.5.2.5 . Sequence: raepe / yaepe ‘then/there’
Synchronically, raepe/yaepe is a single morpheme. Diachronically though, it is
possible to see that it contains the old Tupi-Guaraní locative postposition *pe.
Nowadays, raepe/yaepe has two main functions. At the sentence level, it operates as the
spatial demonstrative „there‟. I illustrate this in (128). Note that in all its spatial uses,659raepe occurs at the end of the clause. In those instances, raepe can also take the ablative
postposition, =tsui, as well as the restrictive focus =nan „only‟. It should be pointed out
that ablative is the only postposition that raepe can take, unless it is previously
nominalized by -n, as will be shown in §10.5.3.2.
In (128a), raepe „there‟ indicates the location where the event, „the killing‟,
takes place. In both, (128a-b), raepe=tsui indicates a location from where movement
originates.

„This (plane) that goes only to Costa Rica, it comes back from there only.‟
The second function of raepe/yaepe, the most frequent in my database, is that of
a temporal connector that can be translated as „there, then‟. Importantly, raepe receives
this interpretation when it occurs at the beginning of the clause.
Consider the extract in (129), taken from a story about one man that likes to
make fun of people. In this portion, he is making fun of another man by asking him to
perfom a stupid task. Note that the first two lines express a command, which in turn
enables the event introduced by raepe.","[681, 682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689]"
"46Functionalism starts with the fundamental assumption that languages are the way they
are because they evolve so as to serve theirs users‟ communicative demands. In other
words, language is an instrument that “does not exist in and by itself as an arbitrary
structure of some kind,” but “by virtue of being used for certain purposes” (Dik
1997:5).
A central claim in functionalism is that grammar is not an autonomous system.
On the contrary, functionalists turn to grammar-external explanations to account for
empirically attested cross-linguistic generalizations. Universal functional pressures,
iconic principles, processing and learning constrains, diachronic changes, etc. constitute
explanation for the shape of grammar. Thus, functionalists examine languages from a
range of perspectives, which includes pragmatics, psycho-linguistics, socio-linguistics,
ethnolinguistics, language contact studies, historical linguistics, among others.
Typological studies aim to characterize languages based on the types of patterns
they employ to cover certain semantic/pragmatic functions. The fact that certain
functions can be found in language after language shows that they are relevant and
useful, hence general. Because grammatical structures are language-specific, typologists
compare structures in genetically unrelated languages by departing from function to see
how they are formally encoded in languages. Besides establishing the possible logical
types with respect to a given parameter and placing languages into each type,
typological studies arrive at absolute or implicational universals, which in turn have to
be explainable in functional or cognitive grounds (Givón 2001). Consequently, within
the Functional-Typological Approach, both in-depth studies of individual languages and47cross-linguistic studies are considered fundamental to inform and test our theories of
language.
Currently, functionalism is not unified under a single theory but includes a wide
range of theoretical perspectives, such as Role and Reference Grammar, Cognitive
Grammar, Lexical Functional-Grammar, Construction Grammar, etc. However, what
these theories have in common is a rejection of the syntactocentric view of Chomsky,
which holds that structures should be studied independently from their semantics and
discourse functions, and an acknowledgment of the importance of communicative
factors and general cognitive constrains in grammatical theory and analysis (Van Valin
& LaPolla 2002, Goldberg 1995).
Language description, typological studies, and language change studies
generally follow what has been referred to as Basic Linguistic Theory (BLT). BLT
emphasizes the need to describe each language in its own terms, rather than imposing
concepts whose primary motivation comes from other languages. It is based on the
cumulative experience obtained from the description of particular languages and has
greatly benefited from cross-linguistic findings (Dixon 1997, 2009; Dryer 2006). Within
this view, grammatical structures should be worked out inductively on the basis of
evidence from observed utterances. BLT has incorporated structuralist analytic
techniques, particularly in phonology and morphology. It has also been influenced, to a
certain extent, by early generative grammar in syntax, and more recently by generative
and autosegmental phonology.","[75, 76, 77]"
