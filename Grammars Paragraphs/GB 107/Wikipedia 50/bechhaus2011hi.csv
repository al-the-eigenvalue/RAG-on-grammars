and 3"" persons singular and plural. It is constructed by suffixing -m to the present or future participles which are assimilated. The personal endings are those

As Werner’s informants insisted, affirmative forms are never understood as questions but as strong
or emphatic affirmation. He regards a negative question with auxiliary min- asbasis for the affirmative construction which later underwent a semantic shift. The
underlying negative question, however, is presumably not ‘you’re not actually
beating?’, as Werner proposes, but ‘is it not that you are beating/aren’t you beating?’ which was reinterpreted as ‘you’re definitely beating’. In accordance with
Werner, Browne (ibid.) speaks of a ‘collapsed negative’ in Old Nobiin.
The suffixes of the affirmative in Modern Nobiin are the following:
Isc

-miIPL

Werner’s list shows that the negation was further simplified because -muunalso replaced theIst person plural ending still present atLepsius’ time. The origin of -muun remains enigmatic as there is no trace of this
variant in Old Nobiin. Although-i- and -u- often interchangein Old Nobiin,123there doesn’t seem to be one example of it in the case of the negative verb. It can
be speculated whether another negative verb, i. e. mon-/mun- ‘to hate, reject, be
reluctant’ (= m-on- ‘not to love’), forms the basis of this paradigm. There Is,
however, no evidence supporting this suggestion. In all probability, the influenceof the emphatic particle -/o which was regularly suffixed to the negative verb in
Old Nobiin is responsible for the change. A regressive vocalic assimilation might
have led to the change from -i-/-e- to -u-.
For the preterit, the endings of Old Nobiin were completely replaced by the
innovated complex with -kun- which is only rarely used in the positive form (seechapter 10.8). The paradigm of the negative preterit is:

"Participle Periphrastic
The participle is usually—though not always—in the present when used in periphrastic constructions. Tense/aspect is therefore marked at the following secondverb. The ending of the participle is often deleted. Examples are:
(IT1 4.15)
pes-kon in-sna
say-and be-3SGPRETIIIND‘and he said’This is an introduction to direct speech. The participle is reduced and separated
from the following -in ‘to be’ by the conjunction -kon ‘and’. The participle peri-phrastic looks like a mere stylistic variant

forms can presumably be regarded as one reason for their disappearance on the
way to Modern Nobiin. Kept, though changed, were those forms with no non-periphrastic alternatives. Interestingly, most of the second verbs used in periphrasticconstructionsarepreservedinModernNobiin:au-‘to do’,okkir-(causative of ok- ‘to be’) ‘to put’, dar- ‘to be’, kin- ‘be without, be poor’, midde‘be full’ are still documented in the dictionaries as independent verbs.
The development of the verb in- ‘to be’ which was frequently used in peri-phrastic constructions constitutes a special case. In affirmative use, it was replaced by a verb men- ‘to be’. It looks exactly like the negative verb of Old Nobiin and its origin has to be discussed. That this is a random similarity seems tobe highly improbable. The complete paradigm for the present is listed by Lepsius
(1880:79):
Isc

38Gmen or min
men-nam, min-nam

2PL
3PLmen-nu
men-nokom, min-, munmen-nan, min-nanIn addition to that, the original -in reappears in the negative for which Lepsius
(ibid., 117) gives the paradigm with final -7 assimilated to the negative verb:
IsGim-munIPLim-munu2sGim-minam2PLim-munokom3sGim-mun3PLim-minnanmen- ‘to be’ always follows the predicative/adjunctive -a, a way of constructing
verbal complexes which was already present in Old Nobiin, but later completely
replaced the periphrastic constructions. If we take into consideration that one of
the functions of the participle and predicative periphrastic with -in and -men wasto topicalize the verb it is perfectly feasible that the topicalized negative verb
was reinterpreted as positive verb ‘to be’.
In the next chapters, the four constructions which found their way into Modern Nobiin will be presented.","[120, 121]"
"1219.1 Negation
The negation is one of the numerous periphrastic constructions of Old Nobiin.
Undoubtedly, it is one of the most important and frequent periphrastic construc-tions as there is no non-periphrastic negation documented. It is built with the
verb men-/min- ‘not to be’ which goes back to an even older prefixed negation
m- + -in-/-en- ‘to be’. In accordance with its important function in the language,
men-/min- can be used in all three types of periphrastic formations, i.e. it can
follow a participle, predicative or indicative. In many instances, emphatic postposition -/o is attached to the negative verb. Examples for the different types of
periphrastic constructions are:
Participle Periphrastic

documentary texts. Amongst eighteen negative constructions in the texts of QasrIbrim III, none is represented by the indicative periphrastic. This seems to conform with an interpretation of the indicative periphrastics as a focus construction
which is not only rare but was also lost in the process of language change. On the
contrary,122reducedparticipleandpredicativeperiphrasticsarepredominantlyeer tee
Prydocumented in these texts. The reduction can go so far as nothing is left of the
original periphrastic construction, e. g.

el-men-ami
find-not to be-JUSSPRES3SG
‘let (him) not find’ (complete loss)The examples with reduced participle and predicative or complete loss of marker
lead over to Modern Nobiin. Here too, the formerly independent verb min-/menexpresses the negation. In most of the tense/aspect paradigms, a variant muun- is
used. Lepsius, however, presents different forms for 24 person singular and
3"" person plural where old -min- is still preserved. Werner’s paradigm seems tobe further reduced by analogy. There is no trace left of the former periphrastic
construction.","[121, 122, 123]"
"In Modern Nobiin the situation has changed. The element -kon/-ko is suffixed
to a verb but only takes the past tense suffixes. The construction with adjunctive
-a- is lost. The complex is rarely used in the affirmative, but has replaced the old
173past in the negative (see chapters 6.2 & 9.1). The paradigms which the different
authors present are the following:

plural forms have been reduced. Lepsius’ 1st person plural suffix is more complex than Abel’s. The latter might be a reduction as well as a dialectal variation.
Lepsius and Abel mix and confuse two rather different constructions—the one
discussed here with -kon/-ko, another one with -ken—which they regard as sim-ple variations. The -ken construction, however, originates in a periphrastic construction of Old Nobiin and marks a habitual as has been described in chapter 9.4. Lepsius (1880:88) and Reinisch (1879:80) call -kon/-ko perfect markers.
Werner (1987:175ff.) fails to distinguish the formation from the preterit and
describes it as expressing an action which was completed in the past.","[173, 174]"
"Excurse 3: A Short Note on the so-called Emphatic Particles of
Old Nobiin
In many example clauses and sentences cited in this book elements marked as
EMPH for “emphatic” are found suffixed to nominal as well as verbal phrases. Afew remarks on the different particles and their function seem to be indicated.
These remarks focus on Browne’s (1997) classification and commentary which
describe the usage of the emphatic particles. Browne also compiled a catalogue
of examples recommended to those who want to gain a deeper understanding of
the matter.
In Old Nobiin, two emphatic particles, -/o, and -sin, are documented which
were frequently used in various contexts. The original postposition -/o has two
main functions:1. It is a locative (and sometimes instrumental) postposition with the meaning of
‘in, (in)to, from’ which is documented
cited in this book.
2. It is an indicator of focus.in numerous examples from the textsThe first function is rather clear-cut and need not be commented here. With regard to the second function Browne (ibid.) distinguishes the following uses:--lo is regularly added to a noun marked as predicate and reinforces the notion
of predication. It could furthermore be interpreted as a copula, a function it
actually occupies if the nominal subject is missing. With a verbal predicate-lo is mostly restricted to the negative.
—
—
—
—-lo could be suffixed to a nominal predicate in the subjective, then carrying
the notion of predication and functioning as a copula.
-lo could be added as focus marker to a noun or pronouns functioning as
logical predicate in an adjectival cleft sentence.
-lo was a focus marker for adverbial modifications which then could function
as logical predicate in substantival cleft sentences.
-lo presented an optional way of emphasizing structure but was never obligatory. It was, however, frequently used.
Not every -/o, however, is a focus marker!",[103]
"3.4 Formation of Nouns
Old Nobiin had a rich inventory of noun formation suffixes some of which will
be presented and discussed below. Of interest will be those still found in ModernNobiin either as productive elements or lexicalized.
A well documented suffix forming abstract and concrete nouns from verbs is
-at(t)-as intapp-att-‘destruction’fromtapir-‘to destroy’seu-att-‘heir’fromseu-‘to inherit’The element is preserved as -afti in ModernNobiin. According to Werner(1987:91) and Lepsius (1880:29), -atti marks a person, but has a negative connotation in most of the cases, as in
banp-atti*babbler’frombanp-‘to speak’di-atti
mark-atti‘murderer’
‘thief?from
fromdimark-‘to die’
‘to steal, to rob’The negative connotation doesn’t correspond to the Old Nobiin examples. There,
however, we find the denominative and deverbative agent formant -katti which
produces comparable nouns, such as48uk-katt-/ur-katt-‘oppressor, enemy’fromur“to (op)press’”nape-katt‘sinner’fromnape‘sin’The last example is also listed by Lepsius (1880:367) as
nabce-gatti‘sinner’Another similar derivation with a negative connotation in Modern Nobiin is
marja-gatti‘liar’frommarja‘lie, wrong’Old Nobiin -Xatt- is not restricted to pejorative contexts as other examples show.
The same holds true for Modern Nobiin. Both Lepsius and Wemer noted words
ending in -atti in the vocabularies which do not fall in this semantic category, but
are not accounted for. Examples are
fag-atti
till-atti
unn-atti‘half?
‘sweat’
‘progeny’from
from
fromfagtillunn-‘to divide’
‘to sweat”
‘to bear, to give birth to”Old Nobiin pak-katt- ‘share, half? from pag- ‘to share’ shows that an original
-katti might have been reduced in these examples. unnatti is not documented in
Old Nobiin, and (ilatti is only found in a doubtful instance in IT III 39.24 where
Browne (1996:171) tentatively translates ‘bosom’.","[48, 49]"
"Below, Reinisch’s paradigm is given in comparison to the negative question of
Lepsius:99ReinischLepsiusIsG

is obvious. Werner (1987:165) didn’t collect a full paradigm for the negativeon the negative verb men-/min- whereas the old forms go back to an old negative
formant -m-. Unfortunately, there is not muchtextual evidencefromModemNobiin to analyze its function. Thus, the question concerning the relationship
between the forms has at present to remain open.","[99, 100]"
"Lepsius’ examples reveal that the negative forms originally follow the adjunctive
-a (see chapter 10) which is dropped with verbs ending in a vowel or single consonant.
Lepsius as well as Abel list some forms which they regard as remains of an old
preterit negative. In the Ermenne narrative, there is one example Abel discusses:
(Erm. 129)
illaburuu-kududiwirk-a-kum-munonlygirl-smallthrow-ADJ-PRET-NEG3SGwirko-moon-on-goonisultaniissig-j-onthrow-?-3SGPRET-andsultanasked-OBJ-3SGPRET‘Only the little girl didn’t throw, and (as) she didn’t throw the sultan asked her:”Abel interprets -moon- in the second part of the sentence as variant of the negative
-muun and denies a possible relationship with the verb moon- ‘to not want to, to reject’. There are various reasons why Abel’s interpretation seems highly improbable. Firstly, -moon- would be another variant of -miin/-muun- which is only docu-mented once. Secondly, Abel doesn’t explain why the regular negative preterit is
found in the first part of the sentence, but not in the second one. Thirdly, he doesn’texplain why wirk- is followed by -o- in the second instance, by adjunctive -a in
the first one. Correctly understood, -moon- actually is the aforementioned independent verb, together with wirk-, they form a verbal complex with both verbs marked as 3d person singular preterit. The whole sentence should be analysed as:124(Erm. 129)ila

him and his informant has to be assumed. None of the other forms in the paradigm are documented in his narrative.
In a similar way, Lepsius (1880:120) was convinced to have found a few rem-nants of a former negative preterit. His only example comes from the translations
of the gospel and is wrongly interpreted as pluperfect:
(GM 9, 32)
tariin bannittafehemi-ken-kom-mes-sanhis—_understand-IMPERF-PRET-NEG-3PLPRETspeechAs we find the regular -men- (and not -moon-) in this sentence, it is more con-vincingthanAbel’sexample.","[124, 125]"
"88According to Werner (1987:145), the imperative singular of Modern Nobiin is
identical to the verbal base (e. g. unni ‘give birth!’) and the plural shows a suffix-an following the ending -i of the verbal base which is, however, often omitted.
Unfortunately, no further information on the origin of the endings and the use
and function of the imperative are given. Werner also makes no mentioning of
jussive forms. One hundred years earlier, Lepsius (1880:139) listed a more complex paradigm (with tokk- ‘to shake’) for the imperative/jussive.

The negative imperative or jussive of Modern Nobiin evidently corresponds toOld Nobiin “vetitive” forms. Lepsius (1880:141) points out that these endings
follow -a which is the marker of direct speech (see below), thus adding another
correspondence to the Old Nobiin forms:
Lepsius (1880:141)

SG -tamPL (-a)-tam(m)an/tam(m)anaa
PL -tamanThe optional -a is no longer documented by Werner (ibid.) who also doesn’t
mention the use of the endings in the 3 person singular and plural. Examples ofthe use as negative imperative or jussive are found in the gospel of St. Mark and
in the Ermenne text. Below, some examples are given:

‘don’t drive us away’In the modern forms of the positive and negative imperative/jussive, no traces of
the formerly present -so ending are found. Lepsius’ positive paradigm and the
last two negative examples, however, show that the ending was replaced by avariety of suffixes. These necessitate a longer excurse on the origin of these
elements and their various functions.","[88, 89, 90]"
"Excurse 2: The Origin of a Complementizer in Nobiin
According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) the endings -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion are often
attached to the positive and negative imperative. He interprets these suffixes asalternative and arbitrary forms of a subordinating conjunction. Their use with the
imperative/jussive, he continues, is determined by the conception of these con-structions as dependent or subordinate. They can be suffixed to any verbal ending without changing its meaning and function. Lepsius distinguishes these endings from identical suffixes he calls shortened and enclitic forms of the verb iig‘to say’ which he describes as used parenthetically in narratives corresponding toLatin inquam, inquit ‘I said, he said’ (Lepsius 1880:330). Abel (1913:15ff.) has
shown that the two are identical. In his Ermenne narrative these endings are
found as -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye and documented about one hundred times withintwo hundred sentences. Werner (1987:383) mentions the variants -yon/-ayon/
-eyon in his wordlist. He calls the forms “‘subordinating morphemes”, but doesn’tdiscuss their function in his grammar. Although Werner speaks of “subordinating
morpheme”, he adds the translation ‘he said’ to the three variants.
Lepsius, Werner and Abel agree that the endings originate in the verb iig-,
shortened i- ‘to say’ and that the different forms have to be regarded as clitics.
Looking at Old Nobiin we find evidence that originally two verbs with the meaning of ‘to say’, igir-/ig- and il(d)- were present. Only il(d)- was occasionally
reduced to i-. The endings therefore can be traced back to the latter and do not
originate in igir-/ig- which is still present as independent verb in Modern Nobiin.
The process which the commentaries of the different authors indicate resem-bles the one described e. g. by Lord (1976) for West African Kwa languages
where the verb ‘to say’ is reinterpreted as a subordinator, which was probably
first used with complement clauses and was later extended to other clause types.
According to Lord the process begins when a general verb meaning ‘to say’ is90used to reinforce other verbs of saying in the so-called matrix clause. This is the
case in most of the examples from the Ermenne narrative which have the general
verb jig- ‘to say’ reinforced by -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye, as in(Erm. 20)

(-they said)’In the sentences of the Nubian textbook Werner based his grammar on, this con-struction is found in connection with direct speech in almost the same way as in
the Ermenne text:
(Wermer 1987:306, 40.11-12)kajmurti-giiga-tir-oinkirri_gittir-ayadonkeyhorse-OBJsay-BEN-3SGPRETthisloadheavy-[he said]‘the donkey said to the horse this load is heavy [he said]’In the dialogue between the donkey and the horse following the introductory
sentence above, each statement is completed by -ayon or -eyon. It can be concluded that the endings not only reinforce the verb ‘to say’, but generally mark
direct speech, although they are not obligatory.","[90, 91]"
"6.5Admirative/A ffirmativeIn the first version of his Old Nobiin grammar, Browne (1989:26) discussed a
formation which he called admirative. He later (2002:59) agreed with Werner’s
(1987:164) designation of the probable Modern Nobiin equivalent as affirmative.",[98]
"The literal meaning of the clause is ‘a donkey’s foal which is tied’ and the stative
verb is marked as indicative. The subject of the relative clause is the object of themain clause. The second relative clause is juxtaposed and has the suffixes of the
negative indicative. A new subject is introduced in the second relative clause but
its object is identical to the object of the main clause.",[212]
"131In the last example, it can either be understood that the “blood of the innocent” is
habitually or repeatedly shed. Thus, we might have a case of the generalizationof grammatical function where a habitual developed into an imperfective.
Expectedly, in Modern Nobiin no traces of the former periphrastic construction can be found. Instead, we find an unchangeable suffix -ken- which only
takes the endings of the past, thus forming the following paradigm (Werner
1987:176):
1sG
2s8G
3sG-kess
-kenonam
-kenoIPL
2PL
3PL-kess
-kessokom
-kessaThe older grammars by Lepsius and Abel mixed up the verbal complexes with-kun- “perfect(ive)” (see chapter 10.8) and -ken- interpreting both as variants of
the perfect marker. Reinisch (1879) agrees with this interpretation but restricts itsuse as a variant to the negative. Werner (1987:177, 301) interprets -ken- as habitual marker. He cites some examples from a Nubian textbook translated by him:
madrasa-l juu-kess
assar-ii dan batar-kess
diigdakil aay-kess‘I used to go to school’
‘1 used to play with children’
‘I used to do much’These examples come from a lesson within the textbook for Arabic speakers
learning Nubian. Although it tries to tell a little story about a grandfather speaking about his childhood, they are not part of a continuous text but isolated sentences. The translation as habitual ‘used to’ cannot be deduced by a context.
Thus, it is interesting to look at some examples in the longer texts which might
give us some indication of why the early authors confused the constructions with-kun- and -ken-. Although he doesn’t refer to them in his grammar, Reinisch has
some examples in his Nobiin stories which are translated as habituals:

not the literal meaning, and cites more examples with the same introduction. The
next example comes from a slightly different context.","[131, 132]"

"9.5 Copulative Constructions
For the sake of completeness, two additional periphrastic constructions have to
be mentioned here. The following copulative constructions were much less
common in Old Nobiin. Browne’s (1989:29) ‘predicative copulative’ is restricted
to the 2™4 persons singular and plural. It complements the affirmative (see chapter 6.5) which provides the Ist and 34 persons. The suffixes -/e (SG) and -ke (PL)are attached to the predicative, in the plural -/- precedes in the present and future/intentional, -as- in the present and preterit. The forms documented in the
texts are:
PresentSG--PL_-ra-l-ke, -(r-)as-kePreterit ISG-ara-lePL-ar-as-keFuture/IntentionalsG-dra-lePL-arra-l-ke134Modern Nobiin has a full paradigm for the so-called affirmative which provides
enough reason for the disappearance of the form.
Browne (ibid.) identified another periphrastic construction which he called
“indicative copulative”. Postposition -m/(a), otherwise known as following nouns
in the predicative, is suffixed to an indicative. The examples suggest that in these
cases it topicalizes the verb, as in:
(NC 20.5-6)
kim-mis-so-m
ni-mis-so-ma
Cat-NEG-IPLPRETIIIND-COP drink-NEG-1 PLPRETIIIND-COP
‘is it we did not eat, it is we did not drink’That these constructions were uncommon in Old Nobiin might be one reason
they completely disappeared like most of the other periphrastic constructions of135nena enantmmmrrmm naman taataeastmesammmaaian tama

"10. Grammaticalization of Verbal Complexes10.1 Introduction
The loss of periphrastic constructions in the development from Old to Modern
Nobiin coincided with an increasing use of constructions involving so-calledadjunctive -a (see chapter 5.2). Zyhlarz (1928:111) was the first author who
recognized an additional function of predicative -a. It is used in so-called verbal
complexes of Old Nobiin. Verbal complexes are verb strings with two or moreverbs sharing a common subject where verbal morphology only occurs on the
last verb. The other verb(s) often take(s) predicative -a which, however, may be
elided. In accordance with Hintze (1975:16), the -a element in these formations
is called “adjunctive”, although it is presumably identical to the predicative. The
verbal complexes show many characteristic features of serial verb constructions,
but differ in that, for example, overt markers of coordination are possible. Al-though the numerous authors dealing with serial verb constructions in the languages of the world do not always agree on what is absolutely necessary to de-fine one, the absence of this kind of overt marking is listed by Aikhenvald
(2006:1): “A serial verb is a sequence of verbs which act together as a single
predicate, without any overt marker of coordination, subordination, or syntactic
dependency of any other sort.” In many instances, the different verbs constitute a
single predicate and the serial verb construction describes what is conceptualized
as a single event. Aikhenvald (2006:4ff.) lists the following typical formal andsemantic properties:
1. Serial verb constructions act as single predicates.
2. Serial verb constructions are monoclausal and allow no markers of syntacticdependency on their components.
3. The verbs in a serial verb construction share tense/aspect, mood,
and polarity value.
4. Serial verb constructions refer to one overall event.modality,Although, as some examples show, verbal complexes may have typical features
of serial verb construction, they more often seem to agree with what can be
called “clause chaining”. DeLancey (1991), who analyzed Tibeto-Burman Lhasa,137describes constructions which express sequences of events. One or more verb(s)
take(s) non-final affixes and is/are followed by a finite verb with tense/aspect/
mood affixes. Although most of the constructions analzyed by DeLancey refer tomultiple events, there are some verbs occurring as final and finite verbs which
combine with preceeding non-final verbs to express single events. The verb ‘go’
for example expresses distal directionality as final verb. In these constructions,
DeLancey argues, the last verbs became reanalyzed as aspect markers. Having
undergone this process they may occur with non-final markers. DeLancey speaks
of ‘serialized’ verbs in this context. It will be demonstrated below that similar
developments can be observed in Old Nobiin.","[135, 136, 137, 138]"
"ThecorrespondingformlistedbyWerner(1987:239) is -ken-kum-muuna. On the basis of this one example, Lepsius also
reconstructs a complete paradigm which he calls a negative pluperfect. It will be
argued below that Lepsius misunderstood -ken as a variant of -kun, the formeractually being the marker of the imperfective (sometimes habitual).",[125]
"Another construction based on the predicative is the “predicative copulative”
which represents one of the more uncommonformations. The element -7(a) isdocumented as a copula with an antecedent noun in the predicative. It is also
found with verbs in the indicative, a construction which Browne (ibid.) called
“indicative copulative”, and which seems to focus the verb. A final formationbased on the indicative is the “‘copulative with -me”, which is also present with
nouns and pronouns in the predicative. Its function has yet to be described. Zyh-larz (1928:102) called -me “affirmative copula”. The most important constructions of the “secondary sentence conjugation” can be presented as follows:66subjectpredicate
indicativenoun -I{+ -m(a)
+-meindicativepronoun= _ indicative copulative
= _ copulative in -me= __ periphrastic indicativepredicative+ -in
et sim.= __ periphrastic predicativepredicative+-le= __ predicative copulative+ -(I/as)ke
A detailed discussion of the different tense/aspect forms will be presented in thefollowing chapters.","[66, 67]"
"In Abel’s Ermenne text are only two examples of an affirmative perfect:
(Erm. 112)

girlsultan-n-asi
sultan-GEN-daughterkuduud-in-keli
_little-GEN-superlativeaa-nala-goni_to-taokka-goni_—_doll-oos-on.",[174]
"The different functions of the so-called emphatic particles in Old Nobiin outlined
above might explain why so many sentences and clauses with -sin and even more
so with -/o are found in the texts and in the examples given in this study. In spiteof these numerous examples from Old Nobiin, the two emphatic particles obviously have disappeared in Modern Nobiin. The evidence is insufficient to finally
decide on the matter but Khalil (1996) is the only one who cites in his dictionary
of Modern Nobiin a suffix -sen with the presumed meaning of ‘yes, certainly,
sure’ which presumably corresponds to ‘Old Nobiin’ -sin as the translation suggests an emphatic connotation.",[104]
"It can be summarized that the preterit of Modern Nobiin has obviously assumed
most of the functions of the two preterits of the older variant. At the same time,
however, a form emerged which most authors called the perfect. In the negative,this innovated form completely replaced the old preterit which will be discussed
later. In Old Nobiin, two forms of the preterit are found. The so-called preterit I
seems to have been more rarely used than preterit II. This might be one of thereasons why only the endings of the 2.4 and 34 person singular were retained when
the paradigms for preterit I and II finally merged into one. The difference between
the two preterits is difficult to determine in the indicative and non-existent in the83subjunctive. Interestingly, in the predicative only preterit | is found. Most of the
time, the distinction between the preterits is blurred which indicates that the proc-ess of merger and loss had already begun. Some of the functions of the preterits
were later assumed by innovated verbal forms which will be discussed later.","[83, 84]"
"In each case, an actual stative meaningseems to be involved. In contrast, constructions with fii- missing often express
situations that have already been terminated at the time of speaking or any other
reference time, as in
(Erm. 46)geraia-ltoni ud-dan
school-from you-withdaa-siin-ahara —_— noog-iddo ki-kum-mun

(Erm. 69)
ir-siddodaa-ro-iye?you-wherebe-2PLINTERROGPRES-[DS.]“where have you been?’The combination also seems to be impossible in connection with negative and
irtrealis formations.
Besides the constructions with da- ‘to be’ discussed above, Abel’s Ermennenarrative contains examples for stative constructions comparative to those found
in Lepsius’ gospel. The following sentence may serve as an example:
(Erm 72)
ju-a-goni

woman-OB)simark-a-fi-ni
_ be angry-ADJ-STAT-3SGPRESel-on
__find-3SGPRET‘she went and found the woman who was angry’179Although a regular stative interpretation of this sentence is appropriate there is
another connotation present which is even more prominent in the next examples:

"208A double relative marked as object is found in the following example from a
sales contract:(IT III 40, 14-15)

‘the word which he says’ = lit.: ‘the word this he says”As the demonstrative pronouns generally precede their noun in- seems to actually function as a relative pronoun in these constructions. The following example
is from a documentary text from Qasr Ibrim:
—(IT IIL 33, 8-9)
indoll-en-gul-lodui-I-lathiswish-PRESPART-PL-EMPH_be-PART-from‘he is amongst those who wish’According to Browne (2002:84), a relative clause introduced by in- is either
individually definite or typically general. The example above belongs to the
latter category. The literal meaning is ‘being from those wishing’. The pronominal referent is understood, but not expressed.
In all types described above, we find either the participle or the subjunctive in
the relative clause. There are, however, additional constructions which employ
the predicative or even the indicative in the relative clause. This becomes neces-sary if the referent is also marked as predicative. The following variants can be
distinguished:
5. noun-PRED + (noun-OB)) + predicative

“the word which he says’ = lit.: ‘(it) is the word he says’The first example comes from the ‘Miracle of St. Menas’ and shall be explained
in detail because it shows that the structure of sentences in the texts is actually
more complex than the formalized sentences show:
(M. 1.1-3)
nokkor-a

Christ-GENmartyrosu
martyrnissu mina-na
holy Mena-GENau-sa-lo
do-PREDPRETII-COP‘it is a miracle which Mena, the holy martyr of Christ, did’The first part of the example above consists of a nominal sentence marked bypredicative -a. Browne (1997, and others) interprets final -/o as the postposition
functioning as a copula. As suffix -a is sufficient to mark a predicate, -/o can also
be interpreted as emphatic particle or focus marker. au-sa- is a predicative theending of which goes back to a preterit II participle -si/- plus predicative -a-. The
verb in the modifying clause is nominalized, and because of this its subject mina-na is marked for genitive case. The sentence is an example of a restrictive relative clause where the relative or modifying clause restricts the referent, in this
case the ‘miracle’, to a specific member of that class, in this case ‘which Menadid’. Browne (1994:22) classifies this type of construction as “attributive relative
clause”. The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘(it) is a miracle the holy martyr of
Christ Mena’s having done’.","[208, 209, 210]"
"188The impersonal as well as personal forms of the relative seem to be neutral
with regard to tense/aspect. The following three examples from the Menas legend show different tense/aspect markers in the consequent.

The indicative is
marked as present, the conditional has no marker for tense/aspect, and the consequent has the suffixes of the future affirmative.
The combination of conditional + imperative is also documented in the documentary texts where the modern forms of the conditional with -ka- seem to be
preferred:(IT Il 51, 6-8)

"103-sin is employed as emphasizer and copulative, the latter being the primary usage.-sin puts a whole verbal clause or verbal sentence into focus. Repetition of
the particle within the clause or sentence is common but not obligatory.
;
It also functions as focus marker in nominal sentences.
With -appa ‘for’, the particle is obligatory and it may serve as a copulative
with a preceding noun.
-sin regularly has a causal implication, whether it is repeatedin the samesentence or not. The causal implication has to be inferred from context. The
basic function remains that of a copulative.
Suffixed to a noun in the predicative, -sin marks the antecedent of a relative
clause.","[103, 104]"
"6.6 Interrogative
There is no complete paradigm of the interrogative documentedin Old Nobiinalthough we would expect a fully developed paradigm if we look at Modern
Nobiin. According to Browne (2002:66), interrogative sentences can end in:
“i2™ person singular in all examples-haone example 1* person singular and 3™ person singular respectivelyThe suffixes follow the verb/predicate and personal endings. The question can be
introduced by an interrogative pronoun, such as is- or mina (for interrogativepronouns see 4.4). The terminal particle is optional and can be dropped.
(M. 9.1)

‘don’t you remember?’An interrogative pronoun can be placed at the beginning of the sentence or

of Lepsius.
It can be questioned whether the modern forms given by Werner actually developed from the Old Nobiin forms. Although they are undoubiedly similar, the
correspondences are by no means regular. The modern forms are evidently basedAlthough the interrogative pronoun is there it is not a wh-type question but a
yes-no one. Second person singular -i seems to be part of a regular interrogative
paradigm which is still present in Modern Nobiin (see below). Suffix -ha, however, listed by Browne under the same heading is not part of that paradigm. Inthe two instances documented, it follows interrogative pronouns, thus additionally marking wh-type questions, as in

2nd person and seems to correspond to the Old Nobiin form. The suffixes of the
interrogative are:

system is the one developed by Browne (1982:11ff. and later). As his analysis
helps to understand what will be described in the following chapters on the verb,
it has to a certain extent to be presented here. Browne reduced the verbal system
to four basic forms which he named differently over the years. In his older work,
he spoke of “infinitives” meaning a verbal noun. Later, he preferred the term
“verbids” in reference to Jespersen’s (1924) creation. On the basis of numerous
examples from the texts edited by him, Browne demonstrated that these forms
function as verbal substantives as well as verbal adjectives (ibid., 23;
1991:288ff.). Hintze (1989:VII) opposed this terminology and called the forms
“participles” as did Stricker (1940:443ff.) before him. He was positive about a
clear formal and syntactic difference between infinitive and participle. Browne
(1991:88) countered by demonstrating that Hintze’s “infinitive” is actually a
reduced form of his “participle”. In retrospective, the discussion between Hintze
and Browne seems to have been rather about terminology instead of function.
The forms under consideration here are non-finite forms of the verb with a wide
range of functions. To simplify matters they will be called “participle” throughout this book.
Old Nobiin exhibits four participles distinguished by tense/aspect:
Present
Preterit I
Preterit II
Future-il/-el
-ol(-al 7)
-sil
-aril/-dilThe actual meaning and function of these forms will be discussed in the following chapters.
In Modern Nobiin, three of the four participles are preserved:
Present
Preterit
Preterit (7)-i(i)
-0(0)
-siinThe present and preterit participles are reduced forms of the old ones. The oldpreterit II participle is a more complicated form and has to be discussed. Accord-63ing to Werner, it is different from the other two particles tonally in that the first
two are neutral with regard to tone and adapt to the tonal structure of the verb,
but -siin is marked by high tone. Werner regards the final consonant -n as a mod-ern correspondence to Old Nobiin -/ which actually is documented in several
instances. Another explanation would interpret -siin as originating in an expanded participle -si/-n. This form is a genitive which is used absolutely, i. e.
without following postposition, constructed in analogy to subjunctive forms.
Lepsius wrongly calls the form infinitive of the aorist and distinguishes it from
the participles. -siin functions as a passive participle in Modern Nobiin according
to Werner (1987:197). The following examples from the Ermenne narrative con-tradict Werner’s proposition:
(Erm. 21)
ed-00-siin-anisabahiye-ga_idenimedid-ee-kaaw-00s-amarry-DIR-PART-GENmoming-atwomanporridge-one-OB)make-DIR-ADJ‘The next moming, after he had married, the woman made porridge’

evening-ateskalec-Itoni
waterwheel-fromkis-siin-ahara
come-PART-afteriiga-tir-oon
say-BEN-3SGPRET‘After his father had come from the waterwheel in the evening, he said to him’Obviously, the two sentences do not contain passive constructions. Instead, -siin
seems to be a past perfect participle in both cases. A relation between a pastsituation and an even earlier situation is expressed. Also in both instances the
results of the earlier actions—marriage and arrival of the father—still hold at the
time of the second situation. The difference between -siin and -o(o) becomes
evident in the next example from the Ermenne narrative:
(Erm. 144)

by the second verb. At the same time, simultaneous action is indicated. Both
events are located in the past.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"It has been pointed out before (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996) that Modern Nobiin in a
way looks like a reduced or “simplified” version of its earlier stage. This development can be explained by large numbers of people who spoke Old Nobiin assecond language but often had only imperfect knowledge of the language. Their
“mistakes” entered spoken Nobiin, a process which can to some extent be observed in the documentary texts of Old Nobiin. This process probably intensified
when the language lost its status as quasi-official language.
As has been shown, changes have been most prominent in verbal morphologyand morpho-syntax. The following features of Old Nobiin have been lost or are
only present in reduced or non-productive form:
1. the subjunctive as morphological marker of a subordinate or complementONANAWNclause. the predicative construction
. the periphrastic constructions
. the distinction between preterit I + II. the admirative
. the predicative copulative
. the copulative constructions with -m(a), -me and -so. the emphatic particles -sin and -/oThese constructions were not actually replaced in Modern Nobiin but formative
possibilities were reduced especially where mere stylistic alternatives were em-ployed in Old Nobiin. The most important innovations in verbal morphology or
morpho-syntaxwerebasedonverbalcomplexeswhichgaverisetonewtense/aspect/mode forms. In some cases, the beginning of the process of grammaticalization of independent verbs could be observed in Old Nobiin. New formations include the innovated future/intentional, the new habitual/imperfective,
the durative/resultative, and the perfect(ive).
Corresponding to these processes, main clauses in Modern Nobiin can nolonger take either a predicative or indicative depending on the necessity to
overtly mark person and number but take the one formation which remained.
Likewise, the morphologically marked distinction between main and subordinate/complement clause was lost. This reduction also affected other construc-tions such as the conditional or the formation of relative clauses.
It can be concluded that Old and Moder Nobiin are still closely related but
that the modern variant is a result of language change through interference from
non-Nobiin languages and their speakers.",[218]
"Werner (1987:161) presents a second paradigm for the conditional which differs in the 1st person singular and 1st and 2™ plural and has no correspondence in
Old Nobiin. Only Reinisch (ibid.) lists -kega as 1st person singular alternative
form. He regards -kega as dialectal variation, ascribing it to Mahas in contrary to-kaye which he lists as Fadijja. The forms are:
IsG
2sG
3sG-keeg
-kan
-kanIPL
2PL
3PL-koog
-koog
-kanSome examples for the use of the conditional from the longer texts are:

either the imperative or the so-called innovated future/intentional (see below
chapter 10.5). It has been mentioned above that Old Nobiin had an optional additional marker which introduced a conditional clause, alesin ‘truly’. In ModernNobiin, is has been replaced by the optional particle -on/-lon ‘if? suffixed to the
subject of the protasis, so that a double marking is still possible.
In Modern Nobiin, the endings of the conditional can also follow the perfect
with -ko/-kun. In the Ermenne narrative, we find the following example:
(Erm 4)
ai-lonijunt-an-oo-ko-kaiyetood-ee-koon-unn-oo-ko-kaiyeeiI-ifpregnant-INCH-DIR-PERF-ISGCONDson-one-and-deliver-DIR-PERF-1SGCONDfaatirhassan-gee_faa-uud-is-[...]Shatirhassan-OBJ_IFUT-call-1SGPRET-[...]‘if | become pregnant and deliver a son, I will call him Shatirhassan [...]’The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘if | have become pregnant and have delivered a son, I will have called him Shatirhassan’. The function of these construc-tions with the past can be deduced discussing the following dialogue between
Shatirhassan and his father. The two sentences are consecutive in the text.","[107, 108]"
"11.1 Nominal Sentence
As has been presented in chapters 5.1 and 5.2, a nominal sentence of Old Nobiin
has a noun or its equivalent marked as predicate by the predicative suffix -a.
Often, emphatic particles (-sin, -lo, -m(a), -mi) are added to the predicate. In
Modern Nobiin, men- ‘to be’ has to follow. As in the 3 person singular, the verb
can be dropped, the resulting construction resembles those in Old Nobiin. Theemphatic particles have disappeared. Examples are given in chapter 5.2 and need
not be complemented here.",[183]
"10.6 The New Habitual/Imperfective
It will be shown that the verb -ak-/-a(a)g- with the original meaning of ‘sit, remain, stay’ had entered into a process of grammaticalization in Old Nobiin assecond verb of a verbal complex which resulted in a durative in the modern language. Not many examples for the beginning of this development, however,
could be found in Old Nobiin. The same holds true for -ak-/-a(a)g- as first verbin a complex.
As the -ke-/-ki-/-k- periphrastics were generalized from the special function of
marking the habitual to a general imperfective, the need may have arisen to findnew ways of expressing habitual action. As we know from Modem Nobiin, this
has actually happened. The a(ag)- complex seems to have filled the gap left by163the original habitual. a(ag)- is one of only two verbs which were grammaticalized as first elements in a complex.
;
In almost all of the classical religious texts, ak- is only documented in the
function of a simple verb. In Lectionary 111,3, however, we find the following
sentence:
(Lec. 111,3)palyei] [r iin Jil-appa ak-dak-tak-ara[sin]
shrine-SUBJ-forsit-be covered-PASS-PERFPREDPART-(for)‘For the [first] tabernacle was set up.’Here, ak- ‘sit’ is used in a verbal complex preceding another verb tak- “be covered’. The complex is ambivalent and can be understood in two ways. Browne(1996:8) lists ak-dak- as a compound with the new meaning of ‘set up’ (‘sit,
remain’ + ‘be covered’). This new meaning is mainly derived from the Greek
Vorlage of the Nubian text which is Hebr. 9.2, where the setting up of the taber-nacle is described. The second possible interpretation derives from just this content. The text talks about the traditional way of sacrifice of the old religion. Habitually, the tabernacle or tent was set up in which the lampstand, the table andthe loaves were of display. From the whole context, a translation of dak- as
‘cover up’ is plausible. Then, ak- could be ascribed the function of marking a
habitual action.","[163, 164]"
"5.1 “Clause Conjugation” and “Sentence Conjugation”
The smallest unit which represents a complete predication in Old Nobiin consists
of a subject marked as genitive and a predicate which is either a participle or the
subjunctive. As it is attested only as a subordinate clause Browne (1982:11)
called it clause conjugation. He represented its components as follows:
clause conjugation:subject
nounpredicate
participle
+ -n(a)pronounsubjunctiveParticiple and subjunctive are verbal nouns. The subjunctive is formed by suffixing personal endings to the different participles. Thus, it overtly expresses person
and number in contrast to the participle. Application of various phonological
rules generates the different endings presented in chapters 6.1 and 6.2. Unless the
subject of the participle is identical to the one of the main clause or to be taken
from the context it has to be expressed. The subjunctive must be used if the subject is not evident.",[65]

woman in question had married seven men when one after the other had died. A
religious interpretation, however, would assume that the marriages outlast thedeath of the participating men and the woman.

we have a context which should make it easier to decide.
In the next example, it is more obvious that the action spoken about belongsto the past and is concluded. The possessed man spoken about here is about to be
healed by Jesus:

perfect constructions in Old Nobiin when they were followed by the suffixes of
the present. Although there are only two examples with the preterit, a perfective
meaning is already indicated in these instances. In Modern Nobiin, verbal com-plexes with kon-/kun-/ko- are restricted to the preterit. This restriction comes
along with a loss of the function of a perfect. The kon-/kun-/ko- complex functions as a perfective in most of the examples above. That Werner failed to distinguish the formation from the preterit indicates a loss in functional differentiationthe endpoint of which was reached in the negative past where the complex with
kon-/kun-/ko- completely replaced the old preterit.","[174, 175, 176]"
"21612. General Conclusions on Language Change inNobiinAlthough Modern Nobiin has much in common with its predecessor Old Nobiin
the language changed in significant ways in the course of about a millennium.
This does not come as a surprise, as language change is a permanent process not
least dependent on the social and political changes its speakers undergo in the
course of time. At all times, Nubia was a region where a multitude of languageswere spoken and written, a multi-lingual contact zone where different factors
influenced language use, language change, and also language shift.
The creation of a written form of Old Nobiin, which was used in different
contexts such as church, political administration, economic transactions and the
personal sphere, is evidence of an highly organized political structure. It alsoseems to have been one important means of constructing a Nobiin identity because at that time, the Nobiin already had two written languages, Greek and
Coptic, at their disposal. As on the one hand the oldest manuscript preserved
dates back to the end of the 8h century and written sources on the other hand
indicate that the Nobiin had been the dominant political force in Nubia from atleast the 6th century onwards, one has to ask for the reason why the Nobiin wanted a written form of their mother tongue at exactly that time. Written sources
from neither inside nor outside Nubia give an answer to that question. We can
only speculate that the period under consideration was a relatively peaceful one
which allowed for such a process. At the same time, the advancing Arab/Moslem
neighbors north of Nubia might have created an urgent necessity to construct and
assure a Nobiin identity. Political and religious changes finally led to the disappearance of written Nobiin at the end of the 15th century. A Nobiin identity seems
to have no longer been sought after.
The multi-lingual setting of medieval Nubia was the main factor in triggering
language change as it was described in this study. Between the 6th and the 13th century Old Nobiin, as the language of the royal house, the administration, and also ofreligion, was of high prestige which was certainly important to acquire knowledge of for all those who spoke other languages as their mother tongue. First and
foremost, the speakers of Nubian Dongolese/Kenzi have to be mentioned here217which were settling in the Nubian Nile Valley as neighbors of and amongst the
Nobiin from the 4"") century onwards.","[216, 217, 218]"
"Abel (1913) as well as Lepsius (1880) have the temporal postposition -famini
‘until’ in the position of -faan. Zyhlarz (1928:95) cites an unfortunately damaged
Old Nobiin graffito where he reads pami ‘until’ which could be related to
-famini. As subordinating conjunction, -famini follows the infinitive, as the examples from the Ermenne narrative and the gospel according to Mark show:
(Erm. 39)wilit-ta_inp-adaag-roigeraia-Itoniboy-OBJawait-DUR-IPLJUSSschool-from come-INFPRET-untilkir-o-famin‘let us sit and wait for the boy until he comes from school’203(GM 6.10)

If the subject is expressed as in the second instance, it is in the genitive in accordance with the nominal character of the verb
in the subordinate clause.
Only Reinisch (1879:39ff.) gives -faan as well as -famini as Nobiin forms in
his dictionary. This could indicate a dialectal variation within the language.
There and in his grammar (1879:148), he cites an additional variant -duofamini/
-duefamini also mentioned by Lepsius (1880:289) who adds variant -duuweJfaminii). An example from Lepsius’ gospel is

which is most probably related to Old Nobiin dul- ‘be (located), exist, remain,continue’ used in periphrastic constructions after the participle or predicative. A
construction like the one above is reminiscent of the periphrastics of Old Nobiin
and could be regarded as evidence for their partial preservation in some fossilized
contexts.","[203, 204]"

Although is has been discussed for quite some time by various authors whether
the present actually belongs under the heading “Tense”, the paradigms of Oldand Modern Nobiin will be presented here. The following table shows the Old
Nobiin and two sets of Modern Nobiin suffixes:

the subjunctive. Browne (1981:61; 1989a:23) reconstructs the following assimilation processes which resulted in the suffixes of the indicative:

-anaThe present personal endings of Modern Nobiin originate in those of the Old
Nobiin present indicative/subjunctive. Only the second persons singular and
plural are different and have to be innovations. They are not restricted to thepresent but are also used in the past and with different aspects. They are, however, not found with the interrogative present and preterit, the conditional and the
so-called affirmative. The innovations were presumably caused by the ambiguous forms for the 24/3 person singular and Is'/24 plural of Old Nobiin and
were meant to restore unambiguousness. The origin of these innovated personal
endings is obscure. They were not borrowed from another Nubian contact lan-guage or Arabic and must therefore be explained by an internal development of
Nobiin. It has been indicated by Werner (1987:147) that they also differ tonally
from other personal endings in that they alone have high tone, whereas the endings of the 1st and 34 persons have low tone. Although not all the relevant
tenses/aspects have been discussed yet, the innovated forms are listed here:
Present
Preterit
Future/IntentionalSG
SG
SG-nam
-onam
-aanam/-diinamPL
PL
PL-rokom
-sokom
-allokom/-dillokomCompared to the Old Nobiin forms, it becomes evident that the additional ele-ments -m in the singular and -kom in the plural were suffixed to the personal
endings of the indicative. As nasal -m is found in the singular as well as in the
plural, -ko must be some kind of 24 person plural marker. If we look for a possible origin of these endings one of the Old Nobiin copulative constructions seems
to be a likely candidate. In the so-called ‘indicative copulative’ (Browne
1989:29) the postposition -ma, in which the vowel a is often deleted, is attached
to the indicative. -7(a) has the function to topicalize the preceding verb, e. g.
kim-mis-so-m
€at-NEG-IPLPRETIIND-INDCOPDi-mis-so-ma
drink-NEGI PLPRETIIIND-INDCOP‘is it we did not eat, is it we did not drink [...]?’The topic marker might have become part of the personal endings of the second
persons and its original function was lost. The origin of -ko plural is more difficultto determine, because there is no exact corresponding plural marker in Old Nobiin.
In the predicative copulative and the so-called vetitive, there is a particular pronominal element -ke denoting the 2"" person plural. Zyhlarz (1928:105) proposed
that this element developed into the plural marker -ko of the innovated endings by
way of vowel harmony. As the preceding personal endings all show a vowel -o this76is not to be dismissed. The process would have been present -ro-ke-m —> -rokom,past -so-ke-m —» -sokom, and future/intentional -allo-ke-m —> -allokom. Although
this reconstruction is probable, the problem remains that no traces of the process
can be foundin Old Nobiin. This can indicate a recent innovation which tookplace after the Old Nobiin script was abandoned.
In Modern Nobiin, the forms listed are used in main as well as complement/
subordinate clauses.
Taking a look at the contexts in which the present is used without any otheraspectual marking, we find examples like the following:

case—at the time of writing the contract.

corpus and from the more formal religious/theological Chrysostomus Nubianus.
The second is similar in its use of the present but seems to be more in line with a
general imperfective meaning. In the third example, the function as imperfectiveis even more obvious because this quotation from Matthew 16,18 is usually
translated as future or intentional: ‘Upon this rock I will build my church’.
As expected the simple present is only rarely used in the narratives of Modern
Nobiin but often found in the isolated sentences recorded by the various authors.","[73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"The grammar of Nobiin by Werner (1987:184) once more confirms the inability to infer a clear-cut function of the verbal complex with -(oJos. Werner con-fines himself to two observations: -(o)os in a verbal complex marks the “totality”
of the action and therefore also means the complete execution of an action, i. €.
the action belongs to the past. For this reason, the complex can only take the
suffixes of the preterit, a statement which as has been shown does not apply.
What has been proposed by different authors concerning the function and useof -(oJos in a verbal complex and what can be derived from the examples above
can be summarized as follows:
Use of -(o)os with Tenses and Aspects
no restriction (Reinisch)No restriction, but mostly in the preterit and imperative (Lepsius)
no restriction (Abel)
restricted to preterit (Wemer)Aspectual FunctionSyntactic Function‘totality of action’indicates an objectresultative or perfectiveOther
‘emphaziser’
no function discernibleVerbal complexes with the verb -ed in Modern Nobiin have been treated in connection with -(o)os complexes by most of the aforementioned authors, although154in comparison they are still infrequent. -ed has undergone semantic change as an
independent verb, as its meaning was reduced to ‘to marry (or take in marriage)’.
Lepsius (1880:157) regarded the suffixation of -ed to another verb as insignificant. He interpreted e. g., el- and eled- as indiscriminately signifying ‘to find’,
nal- and naled- ‘to see’, etc.. In contrast to the -(oJos complex, the ed-complexwas analyzed by him as wide-spread with the present or present participle and
with the preterit. Reinisch (1879:54) stated that in use and meaning, complexes
with -(o)os and -ed were identical. This assertion is rejected by Werner(1987:184ff.) who interprets -(oJos as more emphatic and -ed complex as synchronically more or less identical with the simple form. It can be used with thepresent but only with the preterit it occasionally obtains a meaning of “actual or
factual happening of the action”. Abel (1913:76) interpreted the function of -edas intensifying the meaning of the simple verb. His translation of some examples, however, tells something else: for the verbs tu/b(e)- and oogire- which have
the meaning of ‘demand’ and ‘call’, the ed complexes tulb-ed- and oogr-ed areformed which are both supposed to mean ‘to bring up, bring about’ (German
‘herbeiflihren’). Here, something like direction or directionality seems to be
indicated as can be seen by the German and English renditions ‘herbei’, ‘up’ and
‘about’. It is worthwhile to look at examples from the Ermenne text. Comparable
to the situation described for Old Nobiin, -ed is attached to other verbs denoting
‘to take’. In these instances, -ed still functions as directional:

clause is also indicated in the next sentence:

absorb-DIR-ADJ‘well [said] the sultan, absorbed this contract in his inner self”15Ssmmneeamnentnneesenees
er ETRONEN A ATTEECEeHere, it is emphasized that the process of absorbing is directed towards the sultan. The verb wudir- ‘to put, to lay’ obtains the meaning of ‘to put on (clothes)’when it is used with -ed. The person who dresses is the reference point and again
-ed marks the direction towards it, as in
(Erm. 61)
wee-konudr-edone-andput-DIR‘and one put on!’In other instances, it is more difficult to deduce a special function of the -ed
complex. In most of the cases, it seems to follow movement verbs, although thedirection of the movement is not necessarily the subject as reference point:

connection with the movement verbs ‘stand up’ and ‘come out’:

gazelle [...] seek-DIR-ADJ‘they stood up and came out and looked for the gazelle’It can be summarized that -(o)os and -ed are documentedin Old and ModemNobiin as independent verbs with the meaning of ‘to pull out, to take out’ and ’to
take, to marry’ respectively. They were used in verbal complexes following the
adjunctive which could be deleted. In the course of the medieval Nobiin period, a
functional split took place, as a result of which on the one hand the original function and meaning was preserved, on the other hand a process of desemanticiza-tion and grammaticalization was initiated. Mostly in combination with motion or
transfer verbs, -(oJos nowfunctions as directional marking‘movement away’from what might be called a deictic center. A deictic usage can also be found
with -ed which mostly in combination with verbs meaning ‘to take’ or transfer
verbs marks ‘movement towards’ a deictic center. As the examples show the
deictic center is a point of reference which can be either animate or inanimate.","[154, 155, 156]"
"Palmer (2006?:5) discusses the difference be-tween indicative/subjunctive on the one hand and realis/irrrealis on the other
hand. Although both may express the distinction between the notional features of
realis and irrrealis, there are differences in their distribution and syntactic function. A characteristic feature of the subjunctive is that it is found mainly in subordinate clauses. Palmer furthermore mentions that the indicative/subjunctive
system usually occurs with the tense systems, a feature which does not apply tothe realis/irrealis system. He discusses a wide range of different subordinate o
complement clauses which are marked by the subjunctive in various language:
of the world (ibid., 107-144). Most of his categories have, however, no relevance
for the use of the subjunctive in Old Nobiin.
Jespersen (1924:314) noted that the subjunctive may simply have the function
of being subordinate and therefore is typically the mood used in subordinateclauses. Palmer (ibid., 142ff.) agrees with Jespersen’s assumptions and stresses
that the subjunctive sometimes lacks any motivation of irrealis. He gives examples from Latin where the use of the subjunctive increasingly concentrated on
marking subordination in general or to distinguish between different kinds of
subordinate clauses.

"11.3.5 Relative ClausesSeveral ways to construct a relative clause are documented in Old Nobiin texts.
These different constructions deserve a thorough analysis which would go be-yond the scope of this study. Fortunately, some detailed preliminary investigation
has been done by Browne (1988) and Satzinger (1990) which serves as basis forthe short presentation and discussion of some Old Nobiin examples from religious as well as documentary texts. The presentation to a large extent follows
Satzinger’s categorization of the different types of relative constructions. Finally,corresponding examples from Modern Nobiin will be discussed.
In relative clauses, a participle, subjunctive or predicative can be found. Optionally, it may be introduced by the demonstrative pronoun in ‘this’. Satzinger
(1990:187) distinguishes three basic types which,
are (with formalized examples):
Il. nounitu+ noun-oB)few modifications included,+ participlesak-ka_pes-ilman
word
say-PARTPRES
‘the man who says the word’ = lit.: ‘the man saying the word’2. noun + noun-GEN + participle
salu_it-inpes-ilword man-GEN say-PARTPRES
‘the word, which the man said = lit.: ‘the word the saying of the man’2073. noun + subjunctive
salu
wordpes-in
say-3SGPRESSUB‘the word, he says’A prototypical type | relative clause is found in the following example from the
Nicene Canons:
(NC 29,11)
tillu.tak-kaau-ol-kagodhe-OB)make-PARTPRETI-OB) _ insult-PRED-EMPHair-a-lo‘(he) insults the god who made him’Although not morphologically marked as such ‘illu is the object of the clause and
therefore the participle is marked as object. The pronominal subject is not expressed.
A type 3 relative clause is documented in the following example from a documentary text. The referent is marked as object:
(IT 111 37, 15-16)
silim-inmaria-npakkatti-kapare-npakkatti-lopel-inIbrim-GENMary-GENshare-OB)land-GENshare-income-out-3SGPRESSUB“the share of the Mary (church) of Ibrim which consists of a share of land’The first example from the Mena legend is a complex sentence consisting of an
interrogative, a relative and a purpose clause. Furthermore, it is a direct speech
statement:
ousfal SevagFeu
womanuensna_—s

us‘father, don’t you remember this which a woman gave to us in order that we might (it) give to the
church of St. Mena’The first part of this sentence is a variant of type 2 above. The first noun is replaced by an interrogative clause the object of which serves as referent for the
relative clause. The relative clause is markedas participle and the precedingnoun is in the genitive. The object of the main clause in-ka ‘this’ is also the object of the relative clause. Again, the verb in the relative clause is nominalized,
and therefore the subject of the relative clause ittu uen- is marked as genitive.","[207, 208]"
"Evidence that it actually is the participle which is found in the conditional is
given in the first example from a letter in which participle and conditional
marker are separated by an adverb:
(IT HI 58.10)
alesin
ikka_peff-il
truely
you judge-PARTwel-kon
again-3SGCONDanni-gil
me-tokarte
letter_pa-eso
write-IMPERSG‘truly if he judges you again, write a letter to me’Often, the protasis is additionally marked by a/esin ‘truly’, as it is the case in the
next example from the Miracle of St. Menas:
(M. 4.16-5.4)
alesin
nod-ilaikamuduu-konnofiloxenith-gille-lo—_ju-retrulymeguide-3SGCONDPhiloxenite-to-EMPHgo-1SGPRESINDgod-SUBJ‘truly, if the Lord guides me, I am going to Philoxenite’105a-ka-), the subjunctive formant is suffixed. In most instances, -/o is added which
according to Browne (1997:21—24) is not the emphatic marker, but the locative.
With -/o initial -/ is often elided or assimilated (Browne 1987:27). If the subject
of protasis and apodosis is identical and unambiguously identifiable -ko-/-ka- is~ pen
te aman
eeThe conditional of Old Nobiin is formed with the suffix -ko- or his variant -kaand is built upon the subjunctive. The reduced participle is followed by -ko- (orain peer
0see7. ConditionalsThe next example also comes from a personal letter. The protasis has the endingsof the conditional including assimilated -/o followed by identical emphasizer -lo
and the apodosis is in the imperative:
(IT III 51.7-8)tri-mon-kaanno-lo
taanna
give-reject-3PLCOND-EMPH her-GEN_asti-tot-ina
gr-eso
daughter-young-GEN cause to be-IMPERSG‘if they reject to give, cause (them) to be her young daughter’s’In the next sentence from the Nicene Canons, we find the endings of the condi-tional followed by the negative verb men- and again including assimilated -/o. In
this instance, however, we find the subjunctive in the apodosis.
(NC 20.2-3)

found in Modern Nobiin and will be presented below. In the sentence from a
personal letter, the shorter ending of the conditional is followed by the imperative in the apodosis:(IT Ill 51.6-7)

Canons:
(NC 20.1)
orpa_ en-kan
wine be-3SGCONDelle
en-kan
wheat be-3SGCOND‘if it is wine, if it is wheat’In Modern Nobiin, a further development of the old conditional is found in one
of the paradigms presented by Werner (1987:161). The paradigm is evidently
based on the variant form with -ka-. The plural forms documented by Lepsius
(1880:11), Reinisch (1879:84) and Abel (1913:14) which represent an earlierform of Modern Nobiin are even more similar to their Old Nobiin predecessors.","[105, 106]"
"The particle -is-, often reduced to -s-, may also take verbal suffixes, as in:
is-sana (i. ¢. is-rana 3PLPREIND)‘whatever/whoever they are’s-ena (i.e. is-ena 3SGPRESIND)‘is it...2?, what is...?’s-il‘who is...?’(i, €. is-il PARTPRES)The last example is only documented in one of the personal letters of Qasr Ibrim
(although there might be one arguable instance in the Stauros text; Zyhlarz1928:43) and seems to be evidence for the development to Modern Nobiin. In
the more informal context of letters, we also find combinations of min-/men- and
-is- which probably are evidence of a more colloquial variant of Old Nobiin:(IT 1123.1)
made56milletmin-is-enawhat-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND‘what about the 56 (artabs of) millet?’(IT II] 48.2)
men-s-enawhat-INTERROG-3SGPRESIND‘what is it?’In Modern Nobiin, these complex forms are not present. The interrogative particle -is-, however, is preserved in a form which has to be analyzed. The followingformations can be found in the various texts and dictionaries:
siddo
sikkir
sille
siddoton
sikkeel(do ‘place’)
(kir ‘manner’)
(INTERROGPART -lc ?)
(do ‘place’, -ton ‘from’)
(keel ‘end, boundary, limit”)‘where?’
‘how?’
‘who?’
‘where from?’
‘how long?, how big?’sillog(-log ‘with, by, through’)‘from where?’sin(n)(GEN marker -n)‘whose?’60It is evident from the geminated middle consonants of the interrogatives that it
can not be the simple particle -(j)s- which is preserved in Modern Nobiin. Instead, it seems to be Old Nobiin s-i/ ‘who is...?’, the interrogative particle
marked as present participle, which provided the basis for the modern forms. The
geminated consonants are the result of regular assimilation processes.

sinnIn summary, it can be noted that in the system of pronouns no basic changes haveoccurred. The loss of inclusive/exclusive distinction with the personal pronouns
is the most noticeable one. Reduction of plural marking at the demonstrativescorresponds to the general changes in nominal plural marking which took place
in the course of the development from Old to Modern Nobiin. Concerning the
interrogatives, some changes which finally led to the modern pronouns were
already observable in the Old Nobiin texts. To these belong the use of -m/(i)i‘why’ and the development of s-i/ ‘who is...?’ combined with different postpositional elements.","[60, 61]"
"Browne (ibid.) analyzed the Old Nobiin verbal syntax on the basis of different
elements suffixed to the predicates of the “clause conjugation”. These elements
are the so-called “postpositions of conversion to sentence status” or “sentence
converters”. They help to convert a “clause conjugation” into a “sentence conjugation”. He distinguished between the “primary sentence conjugation” which is65formed directly from the “clause conjugation” and the “secondary sentence con-jugation”, which is built upon the “primary sentence conjugation”.
The most important formant of the “primary sentence conjugation” is predicative -a, which can also mark nominal predicates. If -a is suffixed to a participle,the so-called predicative emerges. Again, person and number are not morphologically marked. The subject must be expressed and marked as such ifit is anoun and cannot be understood within the context. If the predicative -a is suffixed to the endings of the subjunctive the indicative emerges which also hasperson and number suffixes. A nominal subject has to be marked by the suffix
-(i)I. One of the periphrastic constructions, the so-called periphrastic predicative,
also belongs here.
The origin of the different constructions of the “primary sentence conjugation” can be represented as follows:
subject
nounpredicate
subjunctiveindicative-|pronoun+-a=
participle
participle+ -in=predicative
periphrastic predicativeWhat Browne (ibid.) called “secondary sentence conjugation” emerges by suffixing certain elements to the indicative or predicative. Most of these constructions
belong to the periphrastic constructions or the copulative. The most common ofthe former are the “predicative periphrastic” and the “indicative periphrastic”
which are formed by combining a predicative or indicative with the verb -in ‘to
be’ or an equivalent (see in detail below chapter 9). The periphrastic indicative
seems to have an emphatic function whereas the periphrastic predicative is interpreted as a stylistic variant of the non-periphrastic constructions.","[65, 66]"
"210(M.2, 5-10)
tan nog-ladu-aramiffan-gu-k-ketalle-ion_mir-a-gue-lois-sanaher house-inbe-PREDPRETI_all-PL-SUB)-also-andbarren-PRED-PL-EMPHbe-3PLPRETIIIND‘and also all who were in her house were barren’Here, we find a predicative periphrastic construction (see chapter 9) in mir-ague-lo is-sana with a literal meaning of approximately ‘they were the being
barren’. Again, the relative clause is marked as predicative, mifJan- ‘all’ is the
referent and takes the suffix of the subjective. This is an example for Type 3construction because the main verb is in the indicative.
Finally, Satzinger (1990:196) lists an additional type of relative clause which
is characterized by a referent with predicative ending followed by -sin. The latter
is one of all in all three elements which Browne (1997) described as Old Nobiinemphatic particles and which fulfilled a wide range of different functions. The
relative clause has either the participle or the subjunctive.
In a sales contract from Qasr Ibrim, we find such a construction in a documentary context:
(IT III 37, 19-20)
jan-a-sinetti-ji-sil-gu-I-lonnap-ilprice-PRED-COPreceive-OBJPL-PARTPRETII-PL-SUBJ-andgold-SUBJ 20-COP20-lo‘and the price which I received is 20 gold’Again, the first part consists of a nominal sentence. Predicative -a- is enforced by
-sin. A noun in the predicative followed by -sin as referent of a relative clause is
also documented several times in the more formal religious texts (Browne 1996).
The verb of the relative clause is a participle preterit II marked as plural subjective because the price consists of several pieces of gold. Literally, the meaning ofthe whole sentence is ‘it is 20 gold it is the price having been received’.
In Modern Nobiin, various changes conceming the construction of relative
clauses can be observed. As has been mentioned before predicative and subjunc-tive have disappeared and also the once omnipresent emphatic/focus/copulative
particles -/o and -sin were lost.
Instead of the lost constructions, Modern Nobiin occasionally employs two
clauses marked as indicatives, one of which functions as main, the other one as
relative clause, as in:211(GM I1,2)

mount-3SGPRETNEG‘you will find a donkey’s foal tied which no one has ever mounted’The literal meaning of this bible quotation is ‘you will find a donkey’s foal, it is
tied, no one ever mounted it’. Although this is not rendered in the English translation there seems to be two relative clauses in the Nubian version. As in one of
the examples from old Nobiin above, one relative clause is embedded between
the referent and its modifier which both have the suffixes of the objective case.","[210, 211, 212]"
"11.3.6 ChangesIf one looks at the chapters above to sum up some general observations on language change with regard to syntax one cannot but accept that many construc-tions or parts of constructions observed in Modern Nobiin cannot easily be explained from corresponding Old Nobiin forms or actually have no relationship to
the older language stage at all. This seems to be in contrast to the situation described for other parts of the grammar for which the beginning of language215change could often be observed in the texts, especially in the documentary ones
from Qasr Ibrim.
The most obvious changes took place as a consequence of loss which was
probably triggered by language contact (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996). Diversity inclause or sentence construction was reduced when the predicative and subjunctive disappeared. Of formerly two ways to construct main and complement
clauses respectively, only one for each clause type was preserved.
Nobiin subordinating conjunctions were replaced by loanwords from Arabic, a
process whichrequires rather competentspeakers of the language. Althoughconjunctions were replaced, the corresponding constructions were often maintained, as was shownusing the example of the conditional or certain purposeclauses. The introduction of ken as subordinating conjunction in purpose clauses
is one example for changes which are not easy to explain from Old Nobiin texts.","[215, 216]"
"2.5.1 The TextsThis study is based on Old and Modem Nobiin texts published by various authors. As the corpus of Old Nobiin is restricted, all texts were included except
small fragments and texts where only smaller parts were well preserved. Old
Nobiin textual material extends over a period of seven hundred years. Most of
the texts cannot be dated accurately; paleographic studies which aim at a chronological classification of the material are still missing. There is some evidence that
most of the documents originate in the tenth to twelfth centuries. The oldest
manuscript preserved so far dates back to 797 (Lajtar 1997:117); the youngest
one bears the date 1484 (Adams 1977:533). Half of the documents preserved
cover religious texts, as e. g. translations of the New and Old Testament, homilies
and other Christian writings. The other half comprises documentary texts such as
contracts and letters. In the latter category are 32 manuscripts which were foundin one vessel at Qasr Ibrim and could be identified as part of 12th century archive
on the basis of date specifications at the beginning of the texts. Most of the
documents originate in Lower Nubia where Nobiin is still spoken today. This hasnothing to do with a geographically uneven distribution of writing in Nubia, but
with the northern part being much better excavated than the south.
The two main textual categories differ in several ways. The religious texts are
often works of translation from Greek Vorlagen and because of the specific context represent a rather conservative Nobiin. By far the longest religious text is the24so-called Serra East codex which was published by Browne under the name of its
Greek Vorlage Ps. Chrisostom. /n venerabilem crucem sermo (Browne 1984).
The documentary texts, and within this groups one has to mention specifically
the letters, show a more modern language which sometimes even gives the impression of a “spoken” variety. Many concern economic transactions including
sales of land and orders for payment. We find documentation of emancipation of
slaves and the personal correspondence between dignitaries of the Nubian
church.!°
The entire corpus of Old Nobiin has the size of about one hundred pages of
continuous text.'!' The problems brought about by a corpus which is limited in
content and form are understood but not further discussed here. Nevertheless, it
is more than adequate to serve as the basis for a historical grammar. Hopefully,
more textual material will be found in the future which will allow us to complete
our knowledge of the language. For a survey of the textual editions, I refer to the
list of abbreviations and the bibliography.
The documents mentioned above were used in their published and annotated
form. 1 mainly worked with the numerous publications by the late Gerald M.
Browne whom we owe most of the first or revised editions of the Old Nobiin
texts. His “Old Nubian dictionary” (1996) and his very compact “Old Nubian
grammar” (2002) have been extremely helpful for me. Griffith’s first editions of
different Old Nobiin texts (1913) and the first comprehensive grammar by Zyhlarz (1928) were also consulted.
Because Nobiin definitely ceased to function as written language by the end
of the 15th century we have a large gap in our direct knowledge of the processesof language change which extends over a period of four hundred years. A few
words and phrases were recorded by the Franciscan Arcangelo Carradori in 1635
in Egypt; the material is interesting but restricted and doesn’t help to reconstruct
language change.
The modern written documentation of Nobiin starts with the European scholars Leo Reinisch and Richard Lepsius in 1879 and 1880. The latter undertook his
field researchin Nubiain the1840s, so that what we call ModernNubianstartsin the middle of the nineteenth century. This classification is arbitrary because it
depends on the presence of linguists in Egypt and the Sudan and not on linguistic
criteria. The longest text published by Lepsius is a translation of the gospel according to Mark from Arabic into Nobiin. This he complemented by several
Nobiin songs he recorded when he traveled in the region. In the foreword to his
'0 The different subjects of the documentary texts are discussed in chapter 13.

Africa. Nubia from Prehistory to Islam (London1991) 286-293.","[24, 25]"
"The development of Greek as a lingua franca is closely related to the introduction of Christianity which started in the Sth century AD. At the same time, Greek
became one of the written languages of “international” or diplomatic communi-cation between peoples of different linguistic background. A letter written by a
king of the Blemmyes (Beja) to a Nubian king dated to the 5th century is evidence of this development (Skeat 1977; Plumley 1982). Relating to the language
of this letter, Hagg (1982:105) speaks of “Pidgin Greek, in the strict sense of the
term, that is, a means of communication between two parties, neither of whom
used Greek as his native tongue, and with the grammatical structure partly broken down”. Numerous inscriptions and graffiti show a Nubian-Greek bilingual-ism which exhibits some sort of “mixture” of the two languages. Jakobielski
(1972:14) speaks of “mixed texts [...] which—with fundamentally Old Nubian
structure—preserve some Greek words together with articles or Greek texts with
numerous orthographical and grammatical errors”.",[17]
"Although in this sentence -j- could be interpreted as an intensifier, Abel explains
the context as repetitive, i. e. plurality of action is supposed to be indicated. In
his notes, he therefore translates ‘every time the boy does something wrong’. Theuse of the phrase nahar-ee-ka ‘one day’, however, contradicts Abel’s translation.
Plurality of subjects seems to be indicated in the next example:
(Erm. 131)

—_(-c- instead of -j-)
call-take-come-PL-3PLPRET-and““go into the village, good, call (him)”, and when they fetched and brought him, the sultan said to
him’Abel compares the use of -/- (here as voiceless -c-) in this example with a corresponding passage in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel where we find anotherexample for marking of the plurality of subject:
(GM 7, 32)
tal-logmumurnecjwee-kaa_ekkac-c-isanhe-tomutedeafone-OB)(-c- instead of -j-)take-come-PL-3PLPRET‘They brought to him a deaf-mute.’It can be summarized that the suffix -/- asserted its position as marker of plurality, either of subject, object or action—the last one additionally having developed117into an intensifier—over the course of the centuries without any indication of
erosion or a tendency towards loss.","[117, 118]"
